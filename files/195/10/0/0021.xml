C.C. 21(51)							29th December 1951



		1.	R. Commission on Income Tax.



R.A.B.	Cohen has become Law Lord : can’t preside – has resigned.

	Urgent need for new Chairman.

	Suggest J.A.



P.M.	V. good suggestion.



P.T.	If much of evce. taken, easier to put one of members in Chair.



R.A.B.	No one is suitable.



P.M.	Sound J.A. in my name.		Agreed.





		2.	European Defence Community.



A.E.	Diff. to say when this will come to fruition.  Not before French Parlt. before 20/1.  That’s why they want Lisbon p’poned.

	But if 6 Powers accept Plan while we are in W’ton shd. we declare our posn. before the Parlt’s. ratify. Draft submitted for Cab. to see.



M.F.	Mght help twds getting Fr. Parly. approval.



H.M.	Machinery looks better than it might be.



						Approved.



		3.	Egypt : Sterling Balances.



A.E.	Sterling Paymt’s Agreemt. is the more important to E.  Our delay on that will fox them.

	On Sterling Releases – we must pay the £5 m. unless we denounce the Agreement.  The £10 m. can be held up because no legal oblign. to pay on 1/1.  True there is understandg. we wd. pay on demand : but no legal oblign.  Thus w’holdg. the £5 m. cd. be regarded as econ. sanction.



P.M.	They have broken their treaty oblign.  They can’t expect others to keep theirs.



R.A.B.	If we w’hold £5 m. it’s a breach.  About the £10 m. there cd. be argument tht. it wd. be met on demand.



A.E.	I wd. still wish to hold up £10 m. and indicate tht. our attitude depends on theirs.



R.A.B.	Suspension of S.P.A. will impact them most.

	We can dally over £10 m.  But don’t want to breach the agreement.  C.F.Ministers – Sterling credit doubtful – don’t want to damage our credit.



P.M.	Hold it in suspense.



A.E.	Can’t do that, on the £5 m. w’out breach of Agreemt.



P.T.	There wd. be case for complete econ. sanctions. Dangerous to risk reprisals for £5 m. alone.



W.M.	E.’s breach of one agreement doesn’t justify us in breaching another.



H.M.	This isn’t peace or war.  Right neither to pay nor to w’hold all of it.



O.L.	E. is in special case.  Holding back on this can’t damage sterling much.



P.M.	Paying the £5 m. will put you in the wrong with E. while sacrificing our principle of not paying money to people murdering our men.



H.M.	Will it help or hinder new movement from Farouk?



Ch.	These are not ordinary debts, in my view.



H.C.	That’s an argument for re-negotiating, not abrogating.



P.M.	I will discuss with A.E. and R.A.B. and hold another

	Cabinet this pm.



O.L.	I wouldn’t pay.  



L.P.S.  	Nor wd. I.  Br. public opinion wdn’t understand our paying.  Sterling wd. not be injured – this is sui generis.  



R.A.B.  	Don’t agree : think of relations betwn. E. and Asiatic Doms. with sterling balances.  



P.M.  	If India attacked us as E. has done, we shd. have no oblign. to pay.  



M.F.  	We shdn’t pay.  Put the money in some suspense a/c.



A.E.	W’hold the £15 m. and you may disturb F.’s new approach and provoke reprisals.  I wdn’t do it but I submit to being over ruled.





		4.	U.S. Aid.



R.A.B.	Batt has heard from U.S. tht. there won’t be statement on 31/12.

	They want it either at end/Jan. or when we announce our next dollar balance/reserve.  Suggest this be on 3/1 via 7/1; and get U.S. to make their statement on same day.



P.M.	We shd. protest.  We wanted to keep all this separate from our visit.



R.A.B.	Wd. be day before you arrive.



P.M.	Press them to do it on 31/12, as planned.  Keep it as far away as we can from W’ton talks.



R.A.B.	U.S. Govt. are v. nervous of their public opinion.



P.M.	Our figures shd. be delayed until 8/1.



		P.M. with R.A.B. and A.E. saw U.S. Ambassador.



		P.M. said our statement wd. not be publd. until 8/1.

		He wd. send telegram to Harriman expressing strong view tht.

		the 2 things shd. not be coupled together.
