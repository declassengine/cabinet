C.C. 41(52)							10th April 1952



		1.	Parliament.			[Enter Maclay, D.S., Sw., B-H.



		a)	Guillotine



P.M.	Favour guillotine for N.H. Service Bill.



H.C.	Yes : time table motion on 2nd day.  We mght extend it to Finance Bill in same motion, to save separate debates.  There is a precedent.  It’s a bad thing but warranted by Opposn. behaviour.  Will have times determined by Govt. not by Business Cttee. for we opposed that change in rules of procedure in ’46.



R.A.B.	Can’t hope to get Finance Bill through w’out time-table.

	Cd. Opposn. be asked over floor to discuss that time-table with us.  Believe Gaitskell wd. accept that.



H.C.	No time to do it publicly.  Wd. have to do it privately.



R.A.B.	Say it on the motion.  



B.H. 	Usual channels won’t talk if we don’t use refce.  



H.C. 	Details will have to be in motion, wh. is on Paper on Tuesday.



R.A.B. 	Cd. motion say only 10 days for F. Bill and leave R.A.B. to discuss allocation of that time.



H.C. 	I conclude – no chance of any but private consultns.



B-H.	Our people want the need for this expld. in a speech.  Suggest a b’cast.



P.M.	Can think of no worse subject for b’cast than H/C. procedure.



B-H.	Wdn’t be entirely on techn. ques.



Sw.	Let R.A.B. see Press on this.  



A.E. 	Link it up with b/p crisis.  Broad argument – which cd. go across on the air.



P.M.		b)	Length of Session.



	Practice of running on over summer recess is contrary to principles and interests of H/C.  Q. Speech prelude to grand inquest, after period when Parlt. has not bn. sitting.  Shd. be a long interval.

	Continue this Session to 15/12.  Adjourn to 15/2.  New Session then.

	Give Recess rant a proper chance.  Cd. then get both big Bills before end ’52.  Must try hard for that.

H.C.	Modern practice caused by congestion of legn. in summer and complicns with H/L. receivg. big Bills at last moment.  That was why we opened new Sessions before Xmas and got major 2nd Rdgs. over before Finance business in spring.



P.M.	But we wdn’t have a heavy legn. p’mme in Coronation year.



H.C.	Let us 1st decide wthr. we can pass both Bills this year.



P.M.	If you can’t pass Transport Bill must have a standstill Bill.



A.E.	Can we see a p’mme?  On basis of 2 Bills or 1 Bill + standstill.



Sal.	H/L. wd. need 4 wks. for Steel Bill.





		2.	Iron and Steel Bill.



H.C.	Ministers were asked to send me comments.  Here they are.

	Ld. Ch. concerned about penalties.  



Sim. 	Choice of evils.



H.C.	Have met M/L. points.



P.M.	When wd. you introduce?  



H.C. 	Shortly before we know we can go on with it.



H.C.	Suggest Cab. approve this in principle and leave me and Ch. Whip to make proposals re time-table for introduction.



D.S.	Agree.  Don’t publish until you can take 2nd Rdg. soon afterwards.

	Don’t want undue delay because much Press discn. and many consultns.



J.S.	Small Cttee. incldg. Peers to work out time-tables + priorities.



P.M.	Very well.

			No conclusion reached on this Bill.



								[Exit D.S.

		3.	Road and Rail Transport.



		(a)	Haulage



L.P.	Have now arrived at unanimity.

	Want early statement in form of W. Paper as annexed.

	

P.M.	Publication.  



L.P. 	Again – for considn. wthr. we shd. publish far advance of the Bill.  



Maclay. 	Announcement promised for after Recess.



P.M.	Cd. you then get standstill agreemt. with B.T.C.?  



L. 	I think so.



L.P.	If this is approved this am. conversations with B.T.C. can begin at once.

	We cd. then get standstill on haulage.



Macl.	We shd. need a debate to explain W. Paper.  



M-F. 	Opposn. wd. want one, and wd. give a Supply Day.



		(b)	Road Passenger Transport.

								[Re-enter D.S.



L.P.	Para. 4 of memo.  1930 Act has bn. gt. advantage in past to private enterprise firms.  They wd. suffer from a free-for-all.  Moreover, some areas wd. get no services at all.

	Concln. better to hold an inquiry.  Prs. its institution wd. facilitate an understanding on standstill.





W.M.	If our supporters looked at these together, they wd. welcome our action on (a).  But (b) is difft.  Before 1930, pirates took cream of traffic and other services were undermined.  May now be keeping some operators off who ought to be on.  We need a better balance.  Standstill won’t do  must create a new principle and policy.



P.M.	Agree we want some new principles – which licensing authority wd. accept or Minister cd. enforce.



H.M.	Chief purpose of 1930 Act was to restrict unregulated competition v. rlways.



Sim.	Ques. of principle is wthr. that shd. be contd.



H.M.	Now questioned.  Dislike is not of regulating traffic on roads betwn. difft. services : but of action wh. appears to be designed to drive traffic on to the (now) nationalised rlways.



P.M.	Seek for a set of new principles wh. Govt. cd. affirm.



Sw.	Must have an enquiry first.  Announcemt. of that will help to satisfy our people.



Sim.	The fundamental ques. is wthr. Minister shd. be required (by statute to continue to have regard to competn. against the rlways.



Sal.	There is also the ques. of road service monopoly.  Small men can’t afford to fight his case for entry into a service.



Sw.	If enquiry is procdg.,  Minister cd. exercise a rather wider discretion in determining appeals.



P.M.	Para. 15 says m’while “no standstill”.  We can’t live through that.

	Can’t accept that conclusion.



M-F.	a) 1930 Act has worked with v. little complaint until v. recently.

	b) For 20 yrs. 



M/T. 	of all Parties have administered the Act uninfluenced by pol. views. Disaster if a Tory Minister was the first to abandon this tradition of honest adminn.

	This is why I favour an enquiry to formulate new principles.



A.E.	What happens m’while?



Sal.	Transfer the onus to monopolist to show why he shd. be allowed to m’tain his monopoly.



P.T.	Favour enquiry.  We shd. be as heavily criticised for allowg. unrestricted competition.



L.	With unrestricted competn. from the roads, rlways must operate at a loss.



M-F.	Don’t believe Cab. Cttee. can review principles of 1930 Act.

	Need an independent enquiry – if only for purpose of getting evidence.



P.M.	If so, we must have a standstill m’while.



			Agreed :	Approve W. Paper in principle : consider 				detail at a further mtg. after Recess and 				publish soon after Parlt. re-assembles. 				Any verbal suggns. can be sent to 					Woolton m’while. 



		(c)	Railway Fares.



A.E.	We shd. look more carefully at this.  Increases are designed to cause maximum political trouble.



Macl.	Can’t stop them.  Doubtful if direction cd. be given.



P.M.	Death warrant.

Macl.	No way of mitigating this.  Shall I consult L.O.’s on ques of delaying it?

	One possible method : remit to Tr. Tribunal to do it again.  They wd. resign.



P.M.	Find some means of putting this off.  If B.T.C. resigns, so much the better.



Sw.	B.T.C. is announcing these increases on 16/4.

			

			Meet again at 3.30pm.





		4.	B.B.C. Charter.



P.M.	P’pone for 12 months, or even more, while opinion sorts itself out.

	Opinion v. sponsoring is growing.



		No decision.
