C.C. 66(52).				8th July, 1952.



	1.	Parliament.                       [Enter  Sw., L-B., B-H., D.S., M-B.



P.M.	Discussed Parly p’mme last p.m.

	Must go on with Transport &amp; Steel.  But doesn’t matter wh. side

		of double Qu. Speech passing of legn comes.  We cd. end

		Session July ………



H.C.	Adjourn 1/8.  Re-assemble 14/10.  But wind up Session on 31/10.

		New Session 4/11:  and take Transpt. Bill &amp; Steel Bill 

		simultaneously in new Session.

	Means T. Bill wd. pass 6 wks later than prev. planned.

		No 2nd R. of T. before House rises.

		No debate on Steel W. Paper in Govt. time before House rises.



L.B.	Gt. advantage in p’poning 2nd Rdg.  There wd. now be 3 mos. before

		Cttee.

		H.M. is seekg. to narrow differences on T. Bill.  If battle is 

		joined now, they will be more hostile.

	B.T.C. Rpt. Friday.  They cd. debate it in Supply.  Wd be a bit

		embarrassg. to us because we cdn’t bring in Bill into direct

		discussion because legn.



P.M.	Cd get round that if Opposn wished.  By neutral Motion.



H.C.	Genl. debate on natd indies in autumn.  Oppn mght. on that a/c be 

		persuaded not to debate B.T.C. Rpt. now.



P.M.	Want T. Bill this week, &amp; Steel next.

	Wd welcome debate on Steel- if Opposn wd. find the time.



D.S.	This change will be gt. encouragemt. to steel industry.

	Favour publn of W. Paper before Recess.  But don’t want early debate.

		Fear Labour wd. take posns in a hurry.  They mght. be more

		amenable after time for reflection.  Therefore mght. be better to

		publish in wk. after next – more excuse for not debating it.



H.C.	Rests with Opposn.  If they want debate, we can’t stop them.



P.M.	There will be jaw in newspp.  Why not have some in      [Enter  M-F.

		H/C?

	If assets cdn’t be sold:  &amp; Holding Trust still held them:  Socialists

		shd. like the supervision side of the scheme.



P.M.	What business betwn. 14/10 and 31/10?



H.C.	Small Bills to be polished off – incldg. Visiting Forces Bill, which

		is controversial.  And 3 days on natd industries.

		Even so, there will be a massacre of innocents.

Sal.	Don’t alter my position, as expld last night.  But I don’t press my

		view.



P.M.	You shd. see Ellis Hunter.



P.M.	Big debates before 1/8   a)  Germany       28-29/7  } – Planned –

			                     b)  Econ. sitn      30-31/7  }

	Care needed in stating Defence case.  We are at risk in saying 

		somethg. wh. implies tht. Bevan was right and Attlee &amp;

		T.U.’s were wrong.  Force majeure &amp; improved quality?

		I will consider presentn.  Think I must handle defence aspects

		on 2nd day.  Spreading it over longer time:  qualitative

		improvemt.



Al.	More effective Forces for same or less money.



H.C.	Ch. Wh. &amp; I will now discuss this plan with H.M.





	2.	Steel:  White Paper.	[Exit  L-B.



	Draft approved.

				[Exit  D.S., B-H., M-B.

				[Enter  S.Ll.

	3.	External Financial Policy.



P.M.	Discussed in smaller circle.  Genl. feeling tht. we oughtn’t to do the

		currency plan at present.  Tho’ R.A.B.’s responsibility is heavy,

		he accepts that.  But b/payments posn is v. precarious.  He

		proposes  a)  cuts in def., imports &amp; investmt.

			       b)  C.E. Confce – policy shd. take a/c of workg. twds.

			                   convertibility.

	On a) we must make statement before Recess.



R.A.B.	Financial advice is from Court of Bank, not Govr. alone.

		Also Hopkins.  And Sir E. Peacock.  All agreed.  I was not

		acting irresponsibly.  Regret reflections in Bank.

	Have put to Govr. B/E. gt. danger of leakage.

	We shall all do our best to get thro’ to autumn with cuts etc.

	We have v. small margin of reserve – only $185 m. of margin.

		A close call.

	I am not ready to accept forced devaluation to fixed rate.



P.M.	We cd. claim waiver:  £20 m. on sales of mil. equipmt:  £20 m. on

		coal (run some risk):  £15 or so on oil.  Suppose we cd. get 

		w’in £30/40 m of the gap, &amp; cd. have hope of better results

		next year, we cd. risk somethg. more in 2nd half of ’52.



R.A.B.	I want convertibility &amp; fixed rate:  but that cdn’t be done w’out

		much bigger reserves.

	Must make it clear tht. risks are v. great.



P.T.	On cuts:  danger of announcg. bare list of import cuts – mixture as

		before.  Hope we cd. announce at same time C. Ec. Confce.



H.C.	Cut in housing?



Sw.            x/	Can save 80.000 standards of timber (£5½ m.).  By taking a risk on

		stocks.



H.M.          	 i/	Can run down stocks by a further 10.000 standards – w’out 			affectg. house-bldg.

                   	ii/	Difference betwn. action &amp; announcg.  Don’t favour proclaiming

		abandonmt. of social policies, for sake of creating confidence.  		cf. 1931.



Sw.	Little publicity in x/.  Must tell the trade:  no more.



H.M.	Price has fallen fr. £50 to £60 a standard in last 6 weeks.



L.P.	Import cuts:  generalisation.  Effect on food.  Any redn in consumptn

		levels wd. be a mistake.  Can meet next 6 mos.’ diffies by more

		riskg. on stocks.



P.M.	Better have an 18 months’ picture.

	Don’t let’s announce things in order to create confidence.



R.A.B.	Traders of world must have confidence in sterling - &amp; that is based

		on import/export balance.



P.M.	But based on a longer period than 6 months.



R.A.B.	Yes:  but we must win thro’ to C.E.C. and to conversations with

		new U.S. Adminn.

                  ||	Cut of 30.000 houses wd. save £       on paymts.  But if that can’t

                  ||	be done politically, we must find somethg. else.



H.M.	Bldg. industry has begun to work.  Cut them back now, and they

		can’t be got going again.



P.M.	Action vice words.

	Decns in next 2 wks.





	4.	Employment.



W.M.	467.000 down to 440.000.  Hope for further drop in July.  This is 

		seasonal.  Looks like return to normality.  Even N.W. is a bit

		better.

P.T.	Satisf. no. of contracts placed in Ulster.

L.P.	Some signs of revival of demand for textiles, now stocks have bn.

		worked off.





	5.	“Property-Owning Democracy.”



L.P.	Talked of this, but done nil.

	Don’t suggest larger investment in housing – under c.i. p’mme.

		But w’in that total cdn’t some encouragemt. be given to people

		wanting to build own houses?

	We mght.	a) give licences freely to those wishing to build on own

			    land.

			b) give subsidies to those who want to build.



P.M.	What about lack of repairs because low rents.  I’ve repaired a cottage

		for £500 for wh. rent is 5/= a wk.



Ch.	Need for review of rents.  Uneconomic price for scarcest commodity.

		All other costs up 2-3 times:  rent only 10%.



L.P.	Aggregns in housing estates.



H.M.	Want to encourage private sector &amp; reduce subsidised sector.

	£769 capital given with each l.a. house:  cpd. with cost of private 

		bldg.  How transfer?

	I have a plan on rents.  Will it be politically popular?



Sw.	Our supporters are asking about our intentions.



H.M.	Climate of opinion is moving twds. acceptg. higher rent level.

		Younger people are getting used to paying good deal more

		than parents still in rent-restricted houses.



Sal.	Cd we take this out of politics?



H.M.	Their plan involves purchase by l.a.’s:  &amp; then raise rents.  But that

		means abolishing l’lords.

	*Let Cttee consider this, as proposed.             Agreed.
