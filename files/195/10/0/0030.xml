		Business in H/C.				[Exit B-H.





		3.	Government Industrial Workers.



		Arguments put by Ministers concerned.



P.M.	To give 3 extra days will cost money and earn no thanks.  Will also identify Govt. with a concession v. hard work.  Better to go to arbitration and let it be forced on us : suits us now and doesn’t preclude us from claiming credit later.



D.S.	53.000 of our workers – will be diff. to keep them on worse terms than outside engineering and imposs. to recruit more.

	T.U.’s won’t regard another 3 days as same as a full week.

	But cdn’t w’draw the privilege days, some of wh. go back to Henry III.

	Anything short of full extra week wd. be rejected by T.U.’s.  They wd. go to arbitn.  They mght. renew ban on overtime.



P.M.	At arbitn. we don’t get discredit of buying popularity contrary to our general policy.



J.P.L.T.	Support W.’s proposition – promise it in ’53.



L.	So do I.  Docks wd. be crippled by extra holiday in ’52.



P.M.	Effect on world opinion of doing it this year.



L.	Arbitratn. wd. give it in ’52.  I prefer W.



R.A.B.	I wd. prefer to make an offer before going to arbitn.



P.M.	Para. 4(3) w’out offer of cash compensation.		} Agreed.

	Go to arbitration if they decline.			}



D.E.	Qua. bldg. labour, must avoid ban on overtime.  Another week wd. be well worth removal of rule ‘last in, first out’ on redundancy.

O.L.	Not v. gt. risk of overtime ban. 



S.	Cdn’t  get D.E.’s condns. accepted in return.



D.S.	Negotns. shd. be pushed along quickly – and taken quickly to arbitn. if need be.

							[Exit above

		4.	Gold Coast Constitution.



O.L.	Cd. have held this if J.G. hadn’t given in effect a pledge.

	To go back on this now wd. do more harm than to yield.



Sal.	Para 7(d).  Cdn’t Ch. Secy. as Dep. Govr. be senior to P.M.



O.L.	Posn. of Govr. is secured by Offr. administering the Govt.



		Appd. – subject to clearing up wording of para.7(d).



I.	S.A. won’t like this.  May I explain the limited extent of his powers – time to do this before announcement.  		O.L. agree	



	

		5.	John Deere Project.



J.S.	Scotland has highest unemplt. in Gt. Britain.  Nationalists will say another example of dirn. from Ldn.  Co. (whom we wanted to attract) may well clear off.  McN. persuaded his colleagues not to close it down.



P.T.	Needs 2.000 t. steel : £¾ m. of public money.  No dollars for ¾ yrs. tho’ quite a good long-term project.  Not at top of priority list.

	If we are serious in giving steel only to top priorities, we shd. not give a starting date to this.



	Seen Bilsland and the firm.  Offered to see them again in autumn.

	Also sent someone to see if site cd. be developed with neighbourg. Rolls Royce site.



P.M.	If we weren’t exportg. steel, we cd. afford to let this go on.

	x.  Hoped attractn of U.S. capitalists wd. be a plank in our policy.  This is forerunner of that.

	Much ill-will will come from this.



W.	x.  No.  We are putting up the capital for this.



W.M.	3.3% unemplt.  Same as Wales.  Much less than N.I. 10%.



P.T.	No factory bldg. is starting in Wales.



P.M.	Cut steel exports.



H.M.	Much done already for S. Wales – prs. too much.  Also Durham.

	No proper grievance from them if this were done in Glasgow.

	Tonnage is not large.  Prs. cd. be reduced by improved design.

	Give them forward date.  A steel saving design.



A.E.	Wd. factory owner (U.S. firm) w’draw altogether on this?



P.T.	The head office in U.S. is considering that.

	Suggested U.S. mght. consider bldg. it themselves.

	B. hasn’t mentioned resignation to me.  



J.S. 	He did to me.



Ch.	V. large amount of steel to this footage.



R.A.B.	Have suggested U.S. Co. shd. bring their own steel and own money.



P.T.	If outside the 1 m. tons allocated.  There are gt. diffies. wh. Ty. are considering.



P.M.	Needs more confidence in U.S. there will be no Bevan Govt. to confiscate such investments.
