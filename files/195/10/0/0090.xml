C.C. 77(52).				20th August, 1952.



	1.	Lynmouth Floods.		[Enter  S.Ll.



H.M.	Scale – wd. be small in Ldn. but is v. heavy in Lynmouth.  Also

		quite a new experience for them.

	First-aid work is going well – emergency Cttee under Clerk of 

		Peace of Co.  1.000 have bn. evacuated – out of 2.000 in joint

		U.D.C. of Lynton &amp; L’mouth.  They will want to return.  

		I resisted suggn of requisitioning remaing. hotels in L’ton

		because this = only source of local income.  Will get caravans in.

	Losses – of individuals:  profit &amp; stock  }  Ld. Lieut.’s fund.

	Don’t overlook loss in other villages.

                 	1)  Shd Govt. make reasonable donation to that Fund, wh. covers

		Devon &amp; Somerset.

                 	2)  Reconstn.  Roads &amp; bridges.  Heavy expre.  Most are roads 			carrying 75% or 50%.  Later on we may have to make an addl 		contn.

	Will send in to-morrow 1st class engineer.

	Not sure river shd. be taken back into old course.

	Main risk now is tht. tides will overwhelm rest of town.

	Insurance cos. are likely to pay on policies (comprehensive).

	Houses – 50 in L’mouth &amp; 50 elsewhere in County.  Where shd. some

		be built?

	Propose i) contn to Fund  ii) state tht. work will be done, &amp; paymt. will

		be considered in due course.



P.M.	Need for some gesture from Govt.  Can’t leave it all to private subsern.



R.A.B.	Pay £20,000 to relief Fund, at once.

	Promise tht. Dpts. will see how best to share out reconstn costs – roads,

		bridges etc.

	Orkneys &amp; Sc. Borders floods – we gave £20.000.



H.M.	Decn of insurance cos. will affect greatly the size of claims on Fund.



P.M.	10/= on every £ subscribed up to total Exch. expre of £50.000.



R.A.B.	Our total expre will be £350.000 or so.

	Say tht. extraordinary Exchequer grants will be paid.



			Agreed:  £25.000 to Fund.

			               Statement to Press shd. include Insurance

			                       point, &amp; extraordinary Exch. grants.



	2.	Persia.



P.M.	Corrce with Truman.  He mght. like to make a gesture in his last few

		months – don’t want it to be one to our disadvantage.

		Read further telegram 3403.

S.Ll.	Three points emerge fr. M.’s conversn

		i)	he is willing for compn to go to Internl Ct.  That, if honest,

			changes whole sitn – so long as arbn covers all, incldg.

			terminn of concession.  I favour followg. that up.

		ii)	financial help.  We cd. relax export &amp; trade controls.  But

			money must come fr. U.S. - &amp; they will prob. give it

			whatever we say.

		iii)	getting oil going.  C.O. are willing to negotiate on that if (i)

			has previously bn. agreed.  I don’t see much chance of

			good result on that.  They must not give better terms to P.

			than what is given to any other oil country in M/East.

	The U.S. at beginning of month suggd a joint approach to P. – U.S.

		grant, U.K. purchase of oil in stores, arbitn on compensn.

		A.E. didn’t accept that – because no Ct. in arbn &amp; we wdn’t

		buy our own oil.



P.M.	Wait 24 hrs. for reply from Truman.



L.	He will hesitate because he has attacked the oil cos. on trust-busting

		basis, as pol. diversion pre-Election.



S.Ll.	Will you send my message to follow up?



P.M.	I will wait for his reply.



S.Ll.	Read F.O. draft of possible joint message.



W.M.	Any U.K./U.S. misunderstanding on “natn”.  We aren’t challenging the

		Act.  We only say that we must have compn for cancelln of 

		concessn.



L.	If we got full compensn for unexpired period of concessn, valn of

		assets wdn’t come in.



P.M.	Am ready to send this off.



S.Ll.	If this goes to Ct., embargo will be ended.  Co. don’t think that

		big people wd. come in.  And doubtful if we cd. go on enforcing

		embargo for much longer.

			

			Agreed:  despatch new draft to-night, with expln tht.

			               “natn” is meant to refer to cancelln of

			               concession:  these words are not the form of

			               reference to the court, wh. wd. have to cover 

			               T. pt. re validity of ’33 concession (his para. 7).



	3.	Japan.



	Not heard.



	4.	Town and Country Planning.		[Enter  H.



	……….

L.P.	Land is not changing hands at existg. use value.  The theory is not

		working in practice.  V. equitable scheme, but human nature

		is not playing.



R.A.B.	£7 m. p.a. on dev. charge.  Shd get £4 m. on my plan.



H.M.	And £1 m. p.a. to collect.



R.A.B.	Inequitable as betwn. one owner &amp; another.  We shall end in trouble.



H.M.	Can’t get back to private bldg. – at 5% interest on loan, no subsidy

		and developmt. charge.



H.C.	I support H.M. – on that a/c.  Private housg. vice subsidised is the 

		task of next 10 yrs.



R.A.B.	Cd exempt those.



H.	Every Tory in H/C. is pledged to abolishg charge – cdn’t

		stomach 60%.

	In Sc. no land is being offered for developmt. because of the charge.



P.M.	Consider wtr. legn can be passed next session.



H.C.	Cttee have worked on this since Feby.



H.M.	Arbitrary nature of the charge.



R.A.B.        x/	Consider some interim measure to hold posn for 2/3 years.

			

			Agreed:  Cttee to consider x/.

				[Exit  H.

				[Enter  A.H.

	5.	Emergency Powers.



M-F.	Prepare Bill to show we are trying.  Sorry we haven’t got rid of

		more:  hope to kill 25 Rgs.





	6.	Boarding Education for Children of Serving Officers.



P.M.	Read my brief.

	Shd taxation be kept high and tax-free allowances given to mitigate it

		to certain classes.



Al.	Bad economy – many senior offrs. are leaving Services because they

		can’t afford to pay for education of their children.

	V. small cost.



R.A.B.	£400,000.



R.A.B.	V. large problem.  Cantnar &amp; Spens have suggd income tax

		allowances.  Colonial Services are also claiming same.

		Must do this in relation to a Budget.

		Will look at it favourably.



Ch.	Money used for children’s educn shd. be relieved from tax.

		Some general solution must be found.



A.H.	Unique problem – officers are all abroad:  they educate their

		children, go bust &amp; then leave the Services.

	Can’t wait until general solution is found.

	Even in next 6 months many will drift out.

	Disturbance element in pay doesn’t include this.



P.M.	Must be considered in relation to next year’s Budget.



R.A.B.	Must devise some special relief in respect of education.



O.L.	Support that approach.



			Agreed:  R.A.B. to consult with M/D. &amp; C.O.

			                       by saying how he stands on general issue.



P.M.	Give me figures of nos. leaving Services on this a/c.





	7.	Transport Concessions to Miners.



L.	N.U.M. have asked tht. subsidised fares, granted in some areas,

		shall be put on national basis.  That wd. have repercussns on

		other industries.  We are trying to keep it to districts.

		But warn Cab. tht. we may have to give way, if we are to avoid

		a b’down and e.g. a strike in S. Wales.

		May we have leave to fight present line, or even link it with

		wages &amp; be subject to arbitn.



W.M.	Can’t subsidise wages in this way in well-paid industry.

	Natl basis wd. be disastrous.





	8.	Industrial Disputes – Electricity Undertakings.



W.M.	May be strike affectg. some power stations.
