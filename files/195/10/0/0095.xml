C.M. 85 (52)					14th October, 1952



1.	    Transport Bill.

                   [Enter Sw., Solr. Genl., B-H



P.M.	H. Morrison, as reported in M. Guardian. 14/10 Contns to Tory Party Funds:  invitn to publish sources of Funds.

	Diff. to know how to tackle this.



M-F.	Not new.  Debated in ’49.  They have said in for months in reln to New Towns Bill and Transport Bill.



Sal.	I wd. treat it with contempt.



P.M.	V. well:  I will let him come to dinner to-morrow at No. 10, as arranged; &amp; say afterwards, if need be, that it was surprising that he accepted my invitation.





2.	    Kenya.



O.L.	Baring’s report.  Satisfied K.A.U. is behind Mau Mau, &amp; wishes to lock up their leaders incldg. Kenyatta.  Pretty rough, but believe it is essential.  Others from Kenya have confirmed this view.

	Action about 23/10.  Battn from M/E. cd. be flown in just in advance.

		A Battn K.A.R., of which 2 are in Kenya – almost all recruited from tribes other than Kikiku.  The other 2 cd. be moved in quickly.  But white battn is more important.



P.M.	Yes:  in addn a show of strength by 100 or so parachutists – dropping and doing exercises.



Al.	There are no aircraft to drop them from – we borrow U.S. aircraft!

But I will look into possibility.



O.L.	Stress that this is rough:  &amp; may be short period of violence.

Action under em. leg. w’out trial – review by judicial committee.





3.	    Development Charge.



A.E.	Now reduced to para. 2 issue – all others cleared away.



P.M.	1947 Act was very stupid:  why did we not oppose it more keenly?



Sal.	Don’t like H.M.’s plan because in involves inequity.  But see that we can’t pay the £300m:  don’t think it poss. to continue Dev. Charge.

Acquiesce in H.M.’s plan – but only as least bad alternative.



R.A.B.	Don’t believe Labour wd. restore D.C. to 100%.

	At 50% D.C. remains a nuisance -  but so are all taxes.

	My reason is tht.

i)	we can reduce it later, if we wish.

ii)	compensn at ‘47 value can be justified more easily if 50% D.C. remains – less inequity betwn. one land-owner &amp; another.

	Inequity by degrees.

	Wd. yield only £2 or £3m. p.a.  But £10m. for compensn in next Budget.



P.M.	Not a ques. of unpopularity – but contrary to publ. interest to deter development:  that’s main reason for abolishing D.C.  Uneconomic plan qua hampering developmt.

	Main Ty. gain is not having to pay £300m.



R.A.B.	Don’t think I cd. easily raise a loan for that.



P.M.	You can’t have it all ways.



W.M.	Abolish it.  Impedes developmt.  Also awkward if you aren’t paying 	out.



H.C.	Abolish it.



L.	50%.



M-F.	Retain some charge – 331/3%.  To acknowledge that some of increased value of land is due to publ. action.



O.L.	Abolish.      Sim. 50%.   M/D &amp; S/S. Scott  Abolish.   Sw.  Abolish



H.M.	Abolition is essential if private house bldg. is to be encouraged &amp; subsidised  house bldg. to be reduced.  Bad tax anyway:  matter for negotiation.

How defend 50%:  what reason for rejectg. amendmt to reduce it to 331/3.



A.E.	On balance, abolish.



P.M.	Reduced rate gives worst of both worlds.



Ch.	Let Ty. recoup themselves on stamp duty.



R.A.B.	Too complex.  Worse than E.P.L.



Sol. Genl.	1947 Act has broken down – let it go.  Hopeless to w’hold £300m. &amp; go on levying charge.



P.M.	Balance of opinion is for abolition.

R.A.B.	Acquiesce in majority view.  Tho’ warn Cab. tht. compensn won’t be held at ’47 value.  Tho’ that won’t arise for 3 or 4 

	years.

			                                                      [Exit B.H.

			                                                      [Enter 3 Service Ministers



4.	    “D” Scheme for Furniture.



R.A.B.	P.Q. by Allen.  Propose to say we intend to introduce at proper time but are discussing with trade guarantees re quality.

	H.Wycombe won’t like this, but I can’t deny what we have bn. saying to the trade.



P.M.	Make it clear that there will be no tax on furniture of the kind required by cottagers.





5.	   German Archives.



A.E.	Can copy before we return – and we can “lose” some if we wish.

	C.O.S. are concerned about some.  Want only to discuss that with U.S. &amp; Fr.  M’while we can get on with the diplomatic documents.



A.H.	S.I.S., cypher, interrogn of Allied persons by Germans.



J.P.L.T.	Influence mines, guided missiles – we cd. prefer to keep.



de L’l	Target identification.



			Memo approved – M/D. with C.O.S., to have discretion to

			                              destroy.





6.	    Chemical Warfare Policy.



P.M.	Cab. shd. take note of this.



Sal.	Don’t like “higher N.A.T.O. authority”.  We shd. make it clear that is a pol. decision.  Stress para. 6.  Tell Canada we are so insisting. &amp; we will consult them when the time comes.



	7.



CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000





			                                                        [Exit 2 Serv. Ministers.



8.    U.S. Fighter Bases in Denmark.



			Memo approved.





9.    Rent Restriction.



H.M.	Keep it open until after by-election.  Avoid raising wide issues.

Short Bill only.

	Don’t favour putting it in Q. Speech.

	Cdn’t bring in Bill until after Xmas or Easter even.



Sw.	Press is now reasonable:  we don’t need to make any early announcemt.



H.M.	Relate rent increase to cost of repairs.  But shd. we take no a/c of repairs already done:  v. inequitable.  Tho’, if we do, it means many more rents are raised at once.

						[Exit de L’l



10.    Borrowing by Local Authorities.



R.A.B.	Indicn tht. l.a.’s won’t greatly dislike.  Will have valuable psych. effect.

	Not v. revolutionary, for their exp’re depends on our policy decisions.

But, to extent they have to go to market, it may make them more economical.

	Likely to strengthen public confidence.



Ch.	Large increase in Bank loans wd. be just as inflationary as large sums below the line.



J.S.	Will smaller authies be restricted?



R.A.B.	Shdn’t make them go on market.  They wd. have to go on same terms as Govt.



H.M.	Short notice:  no consultn with me in advance.  May I discuss with R.A.B.

	It is we, not they, that plan their capital exp’re.  Only a v. small fraction is w’in their control  £2m. out of £476m. is element in cap. investmt. of l.a.’s wh. is w’in their control.

	Shop-window dressing – tho’ that is important.  Aim to get a few to borrow as before.  But they haven’t got any longer their earning capacity (trains etc.) or their high rateable value.

	If we don’t renew in Expiring Laws, l.a.’s will be alarmed &amp; confused.

Is it necessary?  There is a proviso which contracts right out:  &amp; we cd. arrange for 6 to 10 l.a.’s to be exempted – 1,500 of them:  and only about 10 cd. go on the market.



R.A.B.	I want an early psycholog. effect.  Addl exp’re below the line may be £100m. – it’s £75m. now.



H.M.	This will give no addl control.



			Defer – to enable R.A.B. to discuss with H.M.





11.    Opening of Parliament.



Sim.	Queen, at Coronn or at first Parlt. after accession, has to make the Protestant Decln.  She will make it therefore at Opening of Parlt.

Read extract:  as prescribed by Act of 1910.

Geo. VI:  Cab. authorised difft terms:  left out “of my value.”

Do we want to do this again?



P.M.     x/	Consider with C.R.O. &amp;.H.C. &amp; M-F.

	If Geo VI got away with modified wording, may be wiser to stick to the 1937 form.



			Agreed as at x/.
