C.C. 25(52)							29th February 1952.



		1.	Cabinet.				[Enter Sw. and A.Salter



P.M.	Welcomed Lord Alexander.





		2.	External Sterling.



R.A.B.	New plan has bn. killed ….  



A.E.  	Not yet.  



P.M.  	I want to set the people free, but at the right moment.  



R.A.B. 	If we do it, we must do it in time.  



P.M.  	This is still alive.  Suspended.



R.A.B.	V. well.  We may be able to return to it.

	Alternative : interim period plan.

	Only £25 m. in this list wd. take effect by June.

	Wheat : coarse grains : zinc and some metals wd. be immediate.

	The Europn. £50 m. wd. be quicker than many others.

	Or attack on Can. softwood contract, wh. I don’t want to do.

	

Sw. 	Damages wd. be v. serious.



P.M.	Don’t cut coarse grains.  Must have pigs.

	Wheat stocks.  C.O.S. were v. cutting back to 10 (fr. 13½) weeks.  They felt v. strongly and might have resigned.



Sw.	£3 m. cut in softwood = another 50.000 standards.  Wd. reach 250.000 standards by mid ’53.  Strategically v. diff. to replace in that – because Baltic wd. be closed and v. diff. cargo in Atlantic.  Means much bigger p’mme in ’53. prs. on a rising market.



P.M.	Defence.  May have to announce further redn. as cpd. with White Paper.

	Cd. put some blame on failure of U.S. aid.  Alternatively, might slow down, without announcement.



R.A.B.	Only £20 m.  



P.M.  	Cd. find that.



A.E.	Talked with U.S. repves. during lunch.  Lectured them on $300 m.  They are trying to get some of it now.  Can’t blame them much because it was because of Gaitskell’s statement  we didn’t want aid tht. we aren’t in U.S.A. appropn.

	On Def. P’mme, I advise delay w’out announcg. or blaming U.S.  The prodn. freed cd. be used for exports.



P.M.	I wd. aim at saving in that way, but much more – eg. £100 m.



R.A.B.	£470 m. on metal industries on Defence.



A.E.	Small Cttee.  P.M. and AL. to select items wh. mght be delayed.

	Eg.  Armoured Divns = the most expensive.  Shd. we add another in G.



P.M.          *	£100 m. off Def. P’mme as a whole – of wh. about £40 m. on production.



R.A.B.	Limit over-riding priority for defence prodn.  Death knell for exports.

		*  Al. to look into this with D.S. and Sw. and Leathers.

		*  Al. to look into Service oil stocks, with Leathers.



R.A.B.	*  Let me go thro’ all this (save Defence) with Dpts. concerned.



	Europe.



P.M.	Go for wine.



R.A.B.	They will retaliate.  



P.T. 	On textiles.  Damage to E.P.U. etc. wd. be as great on this as under other plan.  Wd. mean brkg.  contracts – don’t let’s do that again.



	Pattern of these cuts is wrong.  No impact at once.  Self-defeatg. if they cut prodn. here or invite retaliation.  Why torture U.K. to redress r.s.a. actions.  Cut our imports by £60 m. and turn attentn. to r.s.a.



Ch.	Must get Doms. to cut their imports.



W.	What is our attitude about 2 plan?  Has R.A.B. abandoned it?

	Or is he going to take it by degrees?



P.M.	I support a return to market freedom.  But not now.  Public are not ready; and we aren’t sufficiently united behind it now.



H.M.	If we do alternative, shall we be ok. Or is drain from r.s.a. such tht. we can’t survive.  If latter, choice is i) funding compulsorily  ii) other methods eg. further paymts. agreemts.  What are the facts?



R.A.B.	Can’t guarantee to do Plan B. on lower reserves.

	Alternative may be compulsory devaluation in 2 months’ time.

	Unanimous advice on currency.  Conflict is fr. economists, who spk. only of effect on trade.



O.L.	By keeping sterling cheap we intensify demand for dollars by countries like Australia.



R.A.B.	Deterioration first known on last day of C.F.M. mtg. and I then warned them tht. plan agreed might not work and tht. more drastic action might have to be taken to save the currency.  Then telegram circulated to Cab. on 11/2.  I gave warning.



		Agreed :  Plan B. is not to be done now.



P.T.  	Reserve figures shd. not wait until end/March.  Put them out before then.



P.M.	We agree on B. as ultimate.  Prs. in 2/3 mos.  M’while interim plan must accord as much as poss. with that objective.  



R.A.B.  	And in Budget say b/p. must be our 1st aim.
