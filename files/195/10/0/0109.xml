C.M. 99(52).				20th November, 1952.



	1.	By-Elections.	[Enter  Sw., B.H.



P.M.	Farnworth &amp; Small Heath.  Not disposed to stop Cab. Minister

		speaking.  Certainly Ministers below the line shd. go.

		Ch. Whip to make a plan.





	2.	Duke of Windsor.



P.M.	Advised him not to come to Coronation.  He will say to Press tht.

		it wd. not be consistent with usage for Coronation to be 

		attended by any Ruler or former Ruler.

	Money.  He will see R.A.B., who will in public interest give him 

		leave to take to France more of his own money to build himself 

		a home there.





	3.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business in H/C.  Tues/Wed. Steel Bill.  M/S. to open:  Mr Low

		to reply early on Wed:  H.M. to end.  Friday:  Debate on Press

		Council Bill.  Had hoped newspp. wd. put fwd. proposals:  they

		have not.  Prs. we cd. say tht. we still hope they will.



P.M.	Let M-F. see the Association.



Sal.	P.Q. by Samuel by H/L. Reform.  I will repeat what P.M. has already

		said.



Sim.	Addresses on Emerg. Powers.



M-F.	Adjourn H/L. debate for final approval on Mon. to pick up any H/C.

		points by amendmt.





	4.	Coronation:  Service Reviews.



Sal.	Queen has agreed to do R.A.F. Review on 15 July.		[Exit  B.H.

		This solves diffies.





	5.	Volta River Aluminium Project.



O.L.	Tho’ no final decision needed, will be diff. to w’draw if prepy commn

		reports favourably.

	4/5ths of our aluminium has to be bought in dollars.  Large bauxite

		deposits in Gold Coast (200 yrs’ supply):  power from 

		Volta River:  £100 m. eventual cost.  Will produce ¾ m. h/p.,

		mostly to be used in aluminium prodn.  We shd. have option

		on 75% of prodn – 140.000 t. p.a. when scheme is complete.

		V. large artificial lake, fr. wh. irrigation cd. be drawn.  Our

		finance wd. be by loan to V. River undertakg.  G. Coast Govt.

		will hold 10% of the equities:  this will reduce risk of 

		appropriation à la Mussadiq.



R.A.B.	Support.  This is way to support developmt.  But does para. 17 go too

		far, at this stage?



Sw.	Will consider a modificn of final sentence.



Sal.	Publication – before Conference?



O.L.	Everyone knows it’s under considn.



Sw.	Can’t risk amendmt. by Confce:  Aluminium Co. might not go ahead.



O.L.	Cdn’t represent this as fruit of Conference.



Sal.	Don’t conceal it from Doms. in Conference.  Don’t press for delay in

		publication.



			Agreed:  Approve project, and announce w’out waiting for

			               Conference.





	6.	Housing Programme.		[Enter  D.E.



Sw.	No increase in timber for wh. we budgeted.



H.M.	May be less if “boneless w.” comes to pass.  Danger that we may do

		more than 230.000 in ’52 (may be 240.000):  and in ’53 we may

		do more than 260.000.  Problem:  to increase private bldg.

		Removal of d. charge will help. Wish, before Xmas, to announce

		in effect removal of licence-control.  L.a.’s have discretion to 

		grant 1:1 but many aren’t doing so.  Complete removal – simpler

		&amp; more dramatic:  nothg. but planning control for any house w’in

		a cubic limit 1.000 ft. &amp; a timber limit:  1½ standards beyond that

		a bldg. licence.  Prs. also allow builder to put up not more than

		6 on same basis.  Alternative is “modified test”.  Wd like to

		discuss that choice (on pol. grounds) with 2 or 3 Ministers.



	*		Agreed:  L.P.S., W.M., M-F. to discuss with H.M.



D.E.	Industry can build 300.000 houses in ’54.  10% expansion in ’52, 

		likely to be repeated in ’53, in bldg. materials industry.



R.A.B.	No more to say.  V. expensive.  Means stiffer budget &amp; less for 

		productive industry than we cd. wish.  Must get more emphasis

		on unsubsidised.  Wd like more than 85.000 private.



Al.	Def. p’mme will be less and finished in ’53.



R.A.B.	For planning purposes I shall assume 270.000 in 1953.

                  y/	What about repairs?  Will there be enough labour for repair of houses

		de-controlled from rent restns.



[H.M.	I need another month to study rent control.]



L.	Means increased cap. investmt in gas &amp; electricity, for more houses.



Ch.	Will industry suffer to extent tht. houses go ahead?  Will overall

		ceiling be held firm?



R.A.B.	Will make the best of it in Inv. P’mme.



W.M.	On y/ nothg. to suggest M/W. reasons are wrong.  They have come out

		of repairs, not fr. other construction.		

					[Exit  D.E.

					[Enter  O.P.

	7.	Maternity Benefits.



O.P.	Larger benefits in total, tho’ one weekly rate will be reduced.



R.A.B.	Support this.  Cost £2.1 m. on Fund:  no need to raise contns in 

		advance of next quinquennial review.



H.C.	Politically vulnerable to reduce any rate.  T.U.C. support won’t help us

		in back streets.



R.A.B.	If we modify one recommn we shall throw it all open to argument.

		Stand on Cttee’s recommn as a whole.



Sal.	Cd you give them choice?



O.P.	Adv. Cttee considered &amp; rejected it.



Sw.	Offer the option if strongly pressed in Parlt.

		

		Memo. approved:  adhere to Cttee’s recommendn.    [Exit  O.P.

					        [Enter  F.H.



	8.	Higher Technical Institutions.



Ch.	L.P. favours, not only S. Ken., but also in Provinces – Manchr. &amp;

		Glasgow.



L.	Damaging shortage of technicians in coal-mining.



R.A.B.	S. Ken. is going on quite fast:  no fresh decn needed.

	Expect Manchr. &amp; Glasgow to expand.  Ready to promise to review

		their investment allowances.  Agree some disentangling will be		needed.



F.H.	Manchr.  Need assurance of enough places for advanced techn. work – 

		don’t want that crowded out by facilities for higher 

		technological work.



Ch.	Let them make proposals for separating the two.



R.A.B.	Am encouraging U.G.C. to get proposals for Manchr.

	Mght. get U.S. aid for this.  Am discussing that with them.



			Memo. approved.			[Exit  F.H.





	9.	Corporal Punishment.



P.M.	Shd we clutter ourselves up with enquiry when p. opinion may give us

		chance to restore flogging for all crimes of violence &amp; cruelty.

		Alternative is to devise much stiffer condns of impt.  What about

		a plebiscite on c.p. – a suitable subject.

	What of re-introducg. for 3 or 5 years, to see if it does reduce crime.

	If we can’t act, I wd. sooner not have an enquiry.



Sim.	Every civilised country, save Brazil &amp; some States in U.S., have

		abandoned this penalty.



M-F.	Wide feeling of anxiety.  But Report in ’38 v. flogging:  abolition

		in ’48:  only 4 years’ trial of no flogging &amp; new methods.  Only

		previously floggable offence is almost only one whose incidence

		has fallen since ’48.  Real need is for increased nos. in Police:

		4.000 below establmt in M.P.D. &amp; similar shortage in other

		centres.  Got 3.000 increase last year.

	Strong arguments v. acting w’out enquiry into post-war conditions.

	Pol. diffy:  only about 3 or 4 to 1 in favour of c.p. among Tories, and

		Labour are solid v. it.  In 1948 O.P. spoke in favour of abolition

		&amp; all of us abstained.

	P. Members’ Bill will now come up in February.  Immediate ques:

		what advice do we give when that Bill comes fwd.  We cd.

		wait &amp; see H/C. opinion on that Bill.



J.S.	Majority of Sc. M.P.’s wd. be against restoration of c.p.



Ch.	Rates of crimes to convns.  App.2.



M-F.	Yes:  That’s why I stress real need for increase in Police.



Sw.	Gross increase in crimes since ’38.

P.M.	Wait for P. Members’ Bill – a good chance to test public &amp; H/C.

feeling.  Cd allow a free Vote.  Tho’ Govt. view wd. have to be stated.
