C.C. 30(52)							13th March 1952



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter Sw. B-H.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	27/3 : 2nd Rdg. N. Health Bill.  Will be strongly opposed.





		2.	Home Guard in N. Ireland.



P.M.	So far no steps.  W.O. now want raise 10 Battns – in cadre 50 men p. Battn, N.I. Govt. have promised to help.  Statement in H/C.

	Excln of N.I. was moved to H/C. and withdrawn on promise to lay Regns.

	There will be pol. trouble, on basis tht. {N.I. Govt will recruit Orangemen}.



Al.	Doubt [   ].  In war, from R.U.C., they were all Protestants.  Now you cd. get R.C.’s to join it.

	Wdn’t bother about squeals from Eire.



M-F.	Seeing Brooke this pm.  But he’s lunchg. with P.M. tomorrow and P.M. can discuss this.

	Religious feeling is not so strong as it was.

	

	No objection raised by Cabinet.			[Enter Nutting.





		3.	Council of Europe.



H.M.	Our original aims frustrated by isolationist attitude of Labour Govt., wh. drove Europ. into federation.  Will they like it so much when they get to it?



	Either E.D.C. comes into force.  Then we shd. remain full members of C/E. with the others who aren’t members of E.D.C.  Endorse A.E.’s plan v ’institutions’ being same as those of C/E:  but this shd. be a group w’in larger group – in order to keep the other 7 in Eur. family.

	Gt. blow to Tory fans if we get nil. more than further division of Eur – viz., Iron Curtain, Sp. and P., E.D.C. Powers the rest.



	Comes up now on federalist plan.  We resist that – but other 6 will too.

	We cd. say no need to settle anythg. until final form E.D.C. is known.  M’while no urgency discuss reform of C/E. Statute.



M-F.	Little diffce. of view on ideas.  But language of A.E.’s memo. mght be misunderstood in Eur.  Para. 4(a).  We shd. m’tain right of Assembly to discuss generally but leave E.D.C. Powers free to have separate discns. esp. on executive basis.  Let Plan of E.D.C. come to C/E. but don’t give C/E. power of decision.

	Para. 4(b).  Don’t have double membership – 2 circles.



	Further ques : need to find big subjects for discn.  Since W.S.C. initiative on Germany and Eur. Army, no decent meat has gone into sausage machine.

	Favour discn. of Sch. Plan, E.D.C. – and also I wd. hope O.E.E.C. in a genl. way.  Integrn. of O.E.E.C. shd. be an aim, tho’ timing is for A.E.



P.M.	I never contemplated amalgam Army.



H.M.	Has moved a long way twds. yr. aim – Divns. are now the unit and each Govt. retains rights over own troops.



N.		A.E. can meet M-F. points on presentn.  Language of Cab. memo. not 		same as that used in Strasburg.  A.E. wants our membership firm and 

		good work for C/E. to do.  Putting Sch. Plan and E.D.C. under C/E. 		wd. do that.  Our assocn. with those jobs cd. be worked out.

		We needn’t commit ourselves to sheep/goat basis.



P.M.		With strong bias v. any double membership.



N.		On O.E.E.C. : C/E. can continue to discuss O.E.E.C. reports.  We want 		them to do so.



L.P.S.		Wd. support A.E. memo.  But H.M. raises much wider issues.  He wd. 		like to see U.K. leading and full member of Continental bloc.  Many 		people wd. shrink fr. that.  U.K. not continental Power.

		I wd. not like to see it pass Cab. tht. we all favoured acting like 			continental nation.  Close assocn. – sympathy etc. but not more.



P.M.		There is the Channel – can’t smudge that out.  Nor the once great 			Empire.



M-F.		The Strasbourg boys have invariably refused to enter a fedn. of Europe.

		But not inconsistent with Tory tradn to play a part in guiding and 			forming Eur. 	opinion.  Disaster for U.K. to shrink from that.

		Free expn of opinion in Assembly – safeguard by Governmental veto 		in Cttee. and Ministers.

		If we hang back, the lead in guiding Eur. opinion will be seized by 			Germany.



L.P.S.		We must leave ourselves free to influence b/power in Europe.

		“With but not in” yes : but no further.



P.M.		I don’t accept whole of H.M.’s thesis.

		Fully support A.E.’s approach : and wd. like to add O.E.E.C. in due 		course.



		A.E.’s memo. approved.



H.M.  		Presentation in Cab. has glossed it.  No fear now

			that C/E. is to be broken up.  Cd. have waited.



		H.M.  Expressed dissent.			[Exit Nutting.  B-H.

							[Enter 3 Serv. Minist. &amp; D.S.



		4.	Arms for India and Pakistan.



P.M.	Worried.  Wanted Cab. to see.



I.	I/P. must have lower priority than other Doms. and N.A.T.O.

	But they don’t seek arms to fight one another – for other purposes : both have v. dangerous frontiers to guard.

	If we play the hand right, I believe we’ll have them on our side in 3rd war.

	Politically, can’t afford to let them seek arms fr. elsewhere.  Eg. Pak. has half promise of aircraft fr. U.S. – objectionable qua. types and also dollars.

	We shd. give them what we can.



P.M.	But what can we afford to give.



J.T.	Attackers cd. be spared.  x/.  But must hold back Sea Fury and Seafire, for our own needs.



P.M.	Why don’t you need Attackers?  Naval Air Arm produces v. little result for money spent.



		Agreed :  Let this go pro. tem. subject to x/.



Al.	Support I.’s view.



P.M.          *	Work for Indian and Pak. Contingents at Coronation.   *



DeL.	Lincolns.  Wdn’t strengthen Pak. A. Force.  Prefer to teach them to fly fighters.  Tho’ we cd. spare them, or some of them.



P.M.	What will India say?  



I.  	Don’t bother about that.



P.M.	Let this roll on : delivery is not until 1954/5.



I.	Don’t let them go to U.S. instead.  They will go there.



Al.	Let them start a trickle : even of more obsolescent types.



P.M.	M/D. and Serv. Ministers see no harm to U.K. in letting these go subject to x/.



DeL.		Wd. like to give them some Spitfires, vice Seafires.





		5.	Defence Production Priorities.



P.M.		Much time lost in argument.  Must go ahead now.  M/D. has done 			much to help our finances.  This essential part of defence production 		must go ahead.



R.A.B.		Para. 6(b) of M/D. memo.  P.M.’s minute gives sub-contractors 			automatic rights.  We shall have same troubles as in early part of war.  		Will distort whole of industry.



P.M.		Surely we can rely on M/S. to control use of this – he is subject to Cab.



D.S.		This is restricted v. narrowly to most important items.

		Sub-contractors : it is there tht. bottlenecks mostly occur – and cause 		the delays in the main works.  Alternative of ad hoc action won’t do  i) 		we shd. have to wait until somethg. went wrong  ii) extra staff.  			Suggest instead spot checks to ensure symbol is not being improperly 		used.  Cd. get industry to police it because abuse hurts other firms.

		Industry pressing me v. hard now P.M. has announced it in speech.



O.L.		Unless you have allocn. scheme (wh. you can’t now) you must let 			symbol go down to sub-contractors.  Allocn. is of course better but 			can’t do it in peace – and admin. cost is v. large.



P.T.		Haven’t pushed claims of exports v. defence (eg. on apprentices).

		But am advised tht. this wd. lead to abuse, and can’t be policed.

		Hope R.A.B.’s alternative can be preferred.



O.L.		Means letting them get out of phase before you intervene.



Sw.		If U.S. will buy some of these, it helps export as well as defence.



R.A.B.		Another battle lost in b/payment war.



P.M.		These few items are vitally important.

		Make M/S. responsible for seeing there is no abuse.



R.A.B.		i) No increased plant needed for Centurions.



D.S.		Cd. leave them out – priority not requd. for existg. p’mme.

		Larger tank prodn. wd. interfere with exports.

		Omission of Centurions wd. go far to meet R.A.B.’s views.

		Nor do I think procedure need be applied to atomic energy, tho’ I wd. 		like it.

		Even at 100% abuse, only 3% of engineering industry wd. be affected.



P.M.		Ready to concede no additional plant.

Sim.		Cd. we not devise sanction to prevent abuse.  Criminal penalties might 		be provided.



D.S.		Industry wd. police it.



		Agreed.	(no extension of plant for Centurions

				(monthly report to Cab. on working of scheme

				(M/S. to ensure no abuse

				(Sim. to consider possibility of sanctions.



A.H.		Shortfall on Centurion shd. fall on U.S. or Canadian orders.



R.A.B.		Not to apply to obsolescent types of aircraft.  



D.S.  		No.



D.S.		Extends to 20 and 30 mm. ammunition.  



P.M.  		Yes.

								[Exit J.T.



		6.	Brabazou and Princess Aircraft.



D.S.		As in memo.

		No buyers or users pro tem.



O.L.		Large ques.  Flying boats as troopers w’out risk of sub. attack.

		4 of these wd. carry a whole battn.



D.S.		R.A.F. plan to use them as carriers depended on Proteus III with longer 		range.



P.M.		Gt. advantage of Princess for trooping.

		At least keep Brabazou flying.



O.L.		30.000 men in pipe-line when trooping by sea.



D.S.		Another £5½ m. to complete all Princesses.



A.H.		We are trooping to F/E. by civil aircraft – cheaper than sea, but dearer 		than R.A.F.



DeL.		Pr. III. non-stop to Eg. 200.	Singap. 6 stages.

	      	II        stop and only 150.	    “     12   “

		Base facilities are needed, for numerous stops.

	{ Cttee.		{M/Def.}	Sw.

	{		{Salter. }    with M/Supply.  S. of  S. War and Air.

	{ 	Report at once.    Today.

								[Exit D.S., de L’isle.



		7.	Libya.



P.M.	Why not stand pat or clear out.



S.Ll.	Trying to negotiate a Treaty   a) Econ. (easy because we are giving money)  b) Mil. We have enemies as well as friends in L.  Violent pro. Egypt. party.  They (our friends) want some bldgs. in Benghazi.



P.M.	Told we are making demolitions in B.  Give me a report on that.

	We can’t evacuate these barracks at cost of bldg. more.



S.Ll.	If nothg. done, we shan’t get much of a Treaty.  C.O.S. won’t like that.

	Eg. period of yrs. might be less.



A.H.	We cd. give up a little accommn. in Benghazi with a lot of fuss.}

									    }Agreed

								                 } 	

S.Ll.	Send out the Board also.  Show the flag.			     

								[Exit A.H.



		8.	Human Rights.



S.Ll.	Designed to embarrass Russians, has ended by embarrassing us and U.S. much more because of our coloured populns.

	One Covenant signed.

	This one will surely emerge in a form in wh. we can’t ratify.

	We must go on, tho’ with knowledge we shall never ratify.



O.L.	Can’t ratify anything wh. involves enforcemt.



M-F.	We cdn’t reverse engines on enforcement.



O.L.	V. well.  Let’s pursue policy of steady obstruction by legal quibbles.

	On Econ : pursue para. 9(b).

	On Civil : it will emerge in a form we can laugh off.





		9.	Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal.



W.M.	Some row whichever way we decide it.

	This man is an active Communist – Chairman of Edn. Cttee.

	This may, however, be a challenge.

	I’m prepd. to say if necessary tht. it wd. be wrong to make such an appointmt. in connn. with industrial relatns.



R.A.B.	That wd. be an extension of Govt. policy.



M-F.	Then let us extend it.  People shd. not arbitrate who don’t carry confidence of those who appear before tribunal.



Sim.	V. strongly approve.



R.A.B.	What will T.U.C. say to that principle?  [Try to carry them with you.]

		

P.M.  	Take this line, but [   ].



R.A.B.	Will be trouble with C.S. Staff Side.  Agitation in H/C.
