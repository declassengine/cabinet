A.E.	Best chance now is to get the 2 industries into discn directly.

Since memo. written, same suggn made by leading Icelandic trawler-owner.

Wd. at least reduce tension &amp; might achieve modus operandi pending agreemt. betw. Govts.



L.	Support this line.



T.D.	Cd. F.O. persuade I. Govt. to authorise their owners to discuss?



A.E.	I will see them

					[Exit Ll.G. and T.D.

 

2.	    By-Election: High Wycombe.



B-H.	Socialists have asked when M/H. is b’castg.  In fact he is doing it 31/10 Friday before the election - &amp; it was too late to alter the plans. Looks therefore as if Opposn will chip in afterwards, on eve of poll.

	All we cd. do wd. be to take Mon. p.m. as well, and exclude	[Enter D.S.

them – makg. that an election b’cast.



Sw.	Cab. decided to leave existg. plans unchanged &amp; risk Labour coming in.

Wiser to stand on that.



P.M.	Consider wtr. we cd. take Mon.  Then if they do use Sat. unfairly, we cd. hit back.



B-H.	Submd later report.

					[Exit B-H.



	Speakers.  General agreemt. tht. A.E. might speak.  Not too unusual.





3.	    Kenya.



A.E.	Report that Mau-Mau may be raised in U.N.  Have authd our Delegn, in consultn with C.O., to take agreed line in that event that we walk out.





4.	    Iron and Steel Bill.



D.S.	Seek final authority to introduce – no major change made.

H.C.	Present on 5/11 to exclude discn in Deb. on Address.



R.A.B.	Para 10 of 1st Sch. – I will settle with D.S.

					[Enter D.E.



5.	    Historic Buildings: Queen’s Speech.



P.M.	M/W. thinks there will be serious disappointment if this isn’t mentioned.

Cd. say in Debate we would do this.



R.A.B.	Opposn wdn’t be critical.



D.E.	This is 1st step in their dirn.  They wd. welcome it.

	Nat. Trust will launch campaign if we don’t act.  Wd. involve v. little Parly time.



H.C.	Not mentioning small houses &amp; rent control.



Sal.	Omit it fr. speech:  prompt enquiry in Deb. on address and  say we hope to do it w’in the year.



			Agreed.

					[Exit A.E.

					[Re-Enter B.H.

6.	    Coronation.



(i) Television



P.M.	Read draft answer to P.Q.’s this afternoon.

	Cantnar’s point.



D.E.	Somethg. in this because techn. diffies have not bn. explored.  N. has told Rank he can make colour film before I have explored techn. diffies.



Sal.	Support proposals in P.M.’s memo.



Sim.	Strong objn to film giving view from the East.  Wd. give them more than television.



D.E.	It was done last time.



Sal.	No colour film if v. high lighting is reqd.  That wd. destroy the atmosphere of ceremony.  N. &amp; M/W. shd. have chance to experiment before final decn reached.



P.M.  	Correspondg. statement in H/Lds. to-day.

	{Memo. approved.

	{Reply to P.Q.’s approved.

	(ii) Seating in the Abbey



P.M.	I’m keen on T.U. repn.  What about wives?



W.M.	Give them an allocn  &amp; let them decide how many wives.

	Small repn of employers.  



P.M.  	Many come in other capacities &amp; they represent v. much smaller propn of popn.



D.E.	C. Service &amp; Services shd. take a bigger cut because so many G.’s who come in own right.



Al.	But Fighting Services are much larger than they were in ’37.

	You might absorb the G’s w’in the totals.



P.M.	V.C.’s shd. be asked.

   *	Let M/W. make a critical examinn of this plan, so that Cab. may offer      

	advice to Earl Marshal.



Sal.	3rd categ. of Peers who don’t perform any public service.  Some think that they shd. be excluded.  But I see no escape from ballot.



H.C.	Safer to say all Peers may come, but Peeresses must ballot.



D.E.	Must I make provn outside Abbey for Peers &amp; M.P.’s who don’t get in.



P.M.	Yes:  consolation box.





	(iii) Other Arrangements.



P.M.	Shd. we not check profiteering in sale of seats on route?



L.	Many firm contracts already made – many with Americans.



D.E.	You cdn’t stop a black market.



Sal.	We shd. not incur a loss on our seats.  Doms, if they think prices are too stiff, can bear the difference themselves.



D.E.	Dom. diffy. due to their relying on our prelimy estimates.

					[Re-enter A.E.



	(iv) Dress.



	Salisb. Cttee to report to Cabinet.







7.	    Industries Disputes Order.

				[Enter I.McL.



W.M.	Was never intended to deprive prof. classes of right to report disputes.

Anomalies – because some disputes may cover these classes as well as others wh. are w’in Order.

	Some Ministers, however, oppose this – at least w’out some upper limit of salary.



R.A.B.	It wd. be easy for high salaried people to get award wh. wd. be v. embarrassg.  Must ask for upper limit.



M-F.	That wd. mean my going back.



I.Mcl.	Consultants &amp; specialists have put in claim, asked for arbitn à la Dankwerts.  They will certainly go to arbitn if Order is widened.  Mght. cost £20 m.  If Ind. Disp. Tribunal is only one open to them they wd. take that.



W.M.	Exclusion was a drafting accident.



P.M.	Do nothing, until pressure becomes irresistible.  Let us see if the feeling about this is really strong.



W.M.	Have bn. delaying:  but it’s becoming a v. live issue – many deputns etc.



P.M.	Bring it up later, if you can’t go on stalling.

					[Exit I.McL.



8.	    Development Areas.



P.T.	Statement to-morrow.  Policy appd by E.P.C.

i.	Intend to schedule an area in N.E. Lancs

ii.	Similar action re area in N.E. Scotl. nr. Peterhead – some assistce with factory building.

iii.	In other ways intend to relax requiremts. wh. must be satisfied before a man can build a factory.





9.	    Unemployment.



W.M.	20/10 – still under 400.000 unempld.

	Have risen only by 8.000 as cpd. with normal 20,000 seasonal in (?) September/Oct.



P.M.	Why has expected rise in prodn not occurred?



R.A.B.	Mainly because of sales diffies in export markets.



A.E.	Likely to get worse.



P.T.	Textile exports may tend to recover slightly.  But increasg. buyers’ market in engineering – growing competn fr. Germany.



Sim.    *	Might circulate to Cab. figures on production.
