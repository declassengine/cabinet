C.C. 20(51)							28th December 1951



		1.	Malaya.				[Enter Sw., D.S., D.E.



O.L.	Are these the right lines?  Want Cab. support.  Then I can proceed.

	Main point : concentrate in Federation, not in wider area.

	Choice of a new No. 1.



P.M.	Robertson asks to be excused.

	Problem now to find someone else.  Can take a little time.

	

O.L.	New Ch. Commr/Police is also v. urgent.  Got a good man in view – (Col. Young, aged 44).  Essentially ques. of organisation.  Officers only 1 in 480 among the specials.  C.I.D. only 40% strength.

	

	General approval of principles of report.

	O.L. to have help of L.P.S., H.M; M-F. and Swinton in going thro’ it, and produce proposals for action for submn. to Cab. when A.E. returns.

	M’while O.L. will continue search for ideal No. 1.

 



		2.	Washington Visit.



P.M.	Read Truman’s latest message re Aqaba.

	I will come back to W’ton to make my speech because of Truman’s pre-occupn. with Congress.



	A.E. will return on 12th.  I on 20th.



R.A.B.	Expect announcemt. on 31st Dec. of 300 m. dollar aid.  Will be out just after you go.  They insist on 10% as loan with no interest for 4 yrs – requirement of M. Security Act.  Can’t question that now : too late to boggle over it.





		3.	Civil Investment in 1952.



R.A.B.	Suggest Ministers who dissent shd. discuss with me next week.



W.	Support that suggn. wd. save Cabinet’s time.



R.A.B.	That leaves only big ques of housing.

	Have discussed with Ministers concerned.  Agreed tht. implicns. of 300.000 target need further study, with experts of Dpts. concerned : on basis of H.M.’s target.  Suggest Sw. shd. preside over officials with directive tht. we want to attain the target, but no addl. labour to go into housing and no more steel than already allocated (unless more fr. U.S.) and special care over dollar expre. wd. be needed.



R.A.B.	Prepd. to face that.

L.	Want Cab. endorsement for 12.000 houses in each year to ’54 for miners.  Wd. impress U.S. re coal prodn.



P.M.	Is H.M. satisfied with what R.A.B. proposes?  esp. the 3 provisos.



H.M.	Grateful for offer to examine ways and means.  But want Cab. endorsement now for my target.  P’mme. errs v. all business principles.  Worst form of socialist planning.  Don’t at all costs announce these “plans”.



	Ask Cab    i) Pledge of 300.000 be met as soon as poss. havg. regard to

	to accept      resources available. 

	now.	      ii) Can’t be done on plan for one year only.  Must have 		           continuity over 3 years.  Housing contracts out of annual 		basis of Inv. P’mme.

		       iii) Endorse figures for the 3 years as in my memo.

			I must reject 215.000 figure.



	I will seek every poss. economy in steel and other materials.

	Will operate under present allocn. – unless more steel obtd. fr. U.S.



P.M.	I agree – no declarations in Parlt.  Wait till we are asked.



H.M.	I accept no addn. to labour force on housing.



P.M.	Houses for miners.  Consult with M/L.  Tied house principle.

	Coal : more encouraging figures from L.  223/4 m. tons are now hoped for (includg. open cast).  Thought only 211.

	This is a further 10 m.  Machinery is beginning to bear fruit.



D.S.	Special houses for aircraft workers also needed.



H.M.	C(51)44 is based on discns. with Dpts.

	Ty. will have to pay a bit more in subsidies in some cases.



A.E.	In Cov. area bldg. workers are being drawn into munitions with bad results on bldg.



P.M.	L. going to Paris on 11/1 to discuss coal at O.E.E.C.  He may fly on to join me in W’ton for 2nd part of my visit.

	M’while he will brief Prof. and Rowan.



		(51)44 approved.   



R.A.B.  	Give priority for miners.



O.L.	Cuts will affect competitive power of B. industry – electricity generation – agric. machinery. Cd. we not be stiffer on non productive things?  Eg. shops, hotels etc.  Shd. be more selective.



Ch.	Too much on maintenance.  Cd. bear a bigger cut.



Sw.	Power stations.  Cd. be much more economically designed.  Much steel cd. be saved by difft. design.

	Cdn’t L. worm this out of Citrine.  He cd. do as much for less money – 



A.E.  	Or more for same money.  Don’t cut allocns.



D.E.	Output of bldg. industry is 20% less with same labour force.

	Must give confidence tht. continuing flow of orders to Bldg. and b. materials industries.



R.A.B.	Housing targets can’t be achieved at expense of other works p’mmes already approved.



L.	Will report to Cab. on power station p’mme.

							                    [Exit D.E.



		4.	Korea.



A.E.	Latest formula, from U.S. meets our views and some Can. points.



	“Consequences of such a breach of the armistice wd. be so gross tht. in all prob. it wd. not be poss. confine hostil. w’in Korea”.

	V. satisfactory.





		5.	Egypt.



A.E.	Appointmt. of 2 Anglo-phil Ministers by Farouk – v. encouraging.

	Must try and help F.

	Lay off public statements pro tem.

	M’while considerable rioting in Cairo v. Farouk.



L.P.S.	Are lrs. fr. troops censored by E. authies. 	)  See  F.O. telegram.   *



P.M.	Ask W.O. why they cdn’t come direct.	)  Minute to S of S. War.





		6.	Steel : Interim Report of Committee.		[Enter Att.G.



H.C.	Outlines memo.



P.M.	Is Duncan in agreement with all this?



D.S.	Yes : Fedn are prepared for even more powers of interventn. by Bd.



O.L.	Paras. 10-12 go v. far.  Surely legn. cd. be passed specially in that event.  V. drastic to take the power at outset.



D.S.	Fedn. suggested Bd. shd. be empowered to order a firm to make extension : expropriate it if they decline.

	This plan of ours wd. cover only developmt. going beyond what is commercially justifiable – only for defence or special reasons (para. 12).  



H.C.  	Para. 11. gives no power to act.



P.M.           x/	Co-opt.  O.L. on Cttee now he is back.    x.





		7.	Road Haulage.



P.M.	R.A.B. inclined to p’pone Road Haulage – poss. until much later in Session.



I.	I wd. like more time in wh. to work out a good plan.

	Is there pol. reason for more haste?  It wd. mean waiting for a year.  That wd. be discouraging to industry.



H.C.	Trouble is : unless Bill in early Feb. it has little chance of passing before summer recess.



M-F.	If it goes even to next session  i) depression among hauliers.  ii) Working of Commn. wd. suffer for uncertainty.

	I think 2nd scheme is 1st rate (the inclusion plan) : it satisfies pledge, integration and natd. road haulage.  I’m for pressing on with it.



P.M.	Get it out even if we can’t get it thro’.  Prefer the larger scheme.



R.A.B.	Ty. not happy about it.  Subsidy to rlways.  Hasn’t bn. discussed with Transport Commn.  Must have time to consider its implications.  A vast scheme for road/rail integration.  Needs more than a months’ thought.



M-F.	Alternative is to wait a year. Choice of evils.

	Grave political mistake to p’pone this until next Session.



P.M.	Get on as fast as we can, with a major scheme.  Worth waiting a month or so.  May have to sit longer in autumn before Session is concluded.



H.C.	If Steel can finish by summer, this cd. follow on and complete in autumn.



P.M.	Aim at getting both Bills this Session -

	Steel leading and completing before summer recess.

		Let us have a Cab. Cttee to work on this.

		(W. wants to be on it.)

							[Exit Att.G.  D.S.

							[Enter Ll.George



		8.	Food Situation.



W.	Amount of our food is determined by financial limits.

	Ministry accustomed to rationing and likes it.

	We must struggle for freedom.

	Examples.  Tea.  Quantities cd. be got.  Price of lower grades 

	wd. drop in the end.  Initial run on stocks wd. be serious.

	Wd. mean £30/40 m. on import p’mme at outset.



	Meat.  A step twds. restoration of free buying.



P.M.	Must have a food policy.  What about a Cab. Cttee.



R.A.B.	Recently accepted cuts in food imports.  This memo. all round, wd. restore most of those cuts.

	Lost 75 m. of reserves in last 2 wks.  4th quarter’s deficit likely to be £356 m.  Reserves will fall to only 300 m. above devaluation level.

	Cdn’t at present consider action on most of these proposals.

	a) Mght do somethg. on offals w’in sterling area – w’out a financial limit.  



W.  	And with a limit somethg. in Argentine?  



R.A.B.  	Yes.

	b)  Tea, pro tem., is too expensive.  Cd. use price variants later on.  



W.  	This is political, not economic.



P.M.	Plan for removing food subsidies and compensating poorer classes.  Not lost sight of?  



R.A.B.  	No.  Monetary policy is proving better weapon than we thght. v. inflation.



P.M.	Continue to study tea and sugar as isolated subjects.



R.A.B.	c)  Eggs.  Rationing has broken down.

	Cheese also.  We at Ty. cd. support M/F. in attempts to remove eggs and cheese from rationing.

	d) F. stuffs.  To m’tain existg. ration we have to spend £15 m. in dollars extra.  V. diff to go further.  800.000 t. fr. Russia, an uncertain source.



W.	It’s for M/F. to get supplies.  All Cab. need consider is removal of financial limit.



Ch.	200 t. of pig meat for 1.000 t. of coarse grains.



P.M.	Increase of pig populn. is justified on defence grounds.

	Must aim at that.

Ll.G.	It’s rise in pig popn. tht. has caused increased need of supplies (£15m).



P.M.	Let W. with M/F. and M/Ag. consult R.A.B. and report back at end/January.

							                        [Exit Ll.G.



		9.	Sterling Balances.



P.M.	Plan to pay E. to go on murdering our troops in Canal Zone.

	They have broken faith.  Surely this card must be kept in our hand.

	Cd. be given as quid pro quo if Farouk can help us.  Tell them they can have no more while situation remains as now.



R.A.B.	Must m’tain confidence in sterling.

	This wd. be major economic sanction.  Previously Cab. declined to apply such sanctions to E.

	Comm. Fin. Ministers meet in Jan.  Want to get them (includg. India) to do better on dollar expre.

	Reprisals by E. wd. give diffies. over cotton and damage Lancs.

	Once you try econ. sanctions you must be ruthless – lesson of history.  This wd. be econ. war.



	Alternatives	a) Lesser step under Agreemt.

			b) Transfer paymts.  d) in earlier memo. by A.E.

			giving B/E. control over E. use of sterling.



	But each of these wd. involve econ. sanctions.

	Thurs.  Either	i) ask Ty. to devise best form of econ. sanctions.

	   or		ii) don’t have econ.  Sanctions and let this paymt. be 		made.



P.M.	E. is difft. from any other sterling balance.



A.E.	Payments Agreemt.  : we can keep them guessing –

	Sterling Release  “   :  nothing wh. requires us to pay on any particular date in ’52.  Keep them guessing on this too.

	Avoid any public announcemt, wh. wd. invite reprisals.

	Agreemt. requires release “in each of the years …..”.



P.M.	Are we dependent on E. cotton?  



P.T. 	Yes : cdn’t do w’out it eventually.  



Sw.  	But we are in strong posn. now because we have whole of Sud. crop and it was a good one.



R.A.B.	May I discuss with F.O. this pm.



P.M.	I accept A.E.’s plan.



		10.	Migration Policy.



I.	Desirable but not essential, as A. will bear the cost.  Want to negotiate that with A.  Will save £½ m.

	At same time renew Emp. Settlement Act.



W.M.	Australia will select skilled workers and miners.  So long as we

                   x/	pay, we have a say.



I.	We cd. bring pressure to bear on Austr. Govt. at a higher level.



A.E.	We ought to work out a proper plan with Doms. concerned.

	Mtg. this summer.



		Memo. approved, subject to assurances on X/





		11.	Cabinet Arrangements.	M/H. to preside at Cab.

							L.P.S. to help eg F.O.
