C.C. 9(51)							20th November 1951



		1.	Parliament : Secret Session .		         [Enter Sw. &amp; LL.G.



P.M.	Had thght it concession to H/C.  In old days Members had more knowledge than public.  Now thght nothg. shd. be said save in public.

	But “never force little dogs to eat mutton”.

	No strong personal feeling.  Ready to defer to feeling of the House.

	

	Agreed:  Don’t force this on H/C. against their genl. wishes.





		2.	Parliamentary Questions on Natd. Industries.



H.C.	Read proposed t. of r.



P.T.	Does this preclude Cttee. for changing existg. law.



H.C.	Shd. be considered industry by industry, w’in existg. law.  Amendmt. of law shd. be for Ministers in 1st instance.



P.M.	Greater control by Parlt. was prominent in our campaign.

	May not it be said tht. by this we are slipping out of it.

	

H.C.	Cd. make it clear tht. this is only a limited part of the ques : other parts will be followed up by Ministers.  In announcement, prob. on Thursday.



P.M.	Begin with disclaimer.  This is not the wide ques. but the narrow and urgent one of P.Q.’s.



H.C.	Size of Select Cttee.  Propn. of Parties.  No lib. unless Cttee. is over 25. Suggest 6 Tories 5 Labour and no Liberal.  This means 5 all + Chairman’s casting vote.



P.M.	Unwise to exclude Liberal.

	They are called “Lib Opposition”.  Give them one at expense of Labour.



H.C.	That wd. be gerrymandering excuse them of.



P.M.	Then let the Chairman be hors concours concerns – propn. only among the members.



P.T.	Negotiate ques. of Liberal repn. – on Cttee as a general matter.

		

		Agreed : (Decide Thurs. – Ch. Whip to come – H.C.

			  (m’while to consult Cl. Davies.



H.C.	P.Q.’s.  Bring Scottish Ques. fwd. one place on the last Tuesday before Xmas – so tht. they have a chance to answer orally.



P.M.	I favour giving another 15 mins for P.Q.’s.  Assertions of Parly. authy.   One of living greatness by wh. our liberties are safeguarded.



H.C.	Will consider that suggn.





		3.	Colonial Foodstuffs and Materials.



O.L.	Asked C.O. to consider what Contn. Colonies cd. make.

	In long-term almost no limit to what cd. be done.

	This, however, is short time.  Seller, not buyer, of primaries now calls the tune.  Amery economics are no longer applicable.

	How can we use Colonies to adjust balance of world econ. power?

	i)  U.K. fiscal policy – makes Col. expansion and developmt. impossible.

	Double taxation arrangemts. remove all benefit of pioneering concession by Colonies.  Must discuss with R.A.B.

	U.S. and Can. Cos. with better depreciation allowances, are in better posn.



	Para. 5(e).

	ii)  Other points in para. 5.  Early need for generous steel allocation.

	Priority second only to defence, prs.



S.	Have done an allocn.   But we are short by 1 m. tons.  Can’t satisfy all demands.



Ch.	Can’t cut into export of steel.



O.L.	Balance of ruined sacrifice for long term benefits.

	iii)  Timber.  Hope H.M. will look at exceptl. methods of using Col. hardwoods – tho’ they cost more and are less acceptable to bldg. industry.



H.M.	Cost = heavy freights.  Possibly they cd. be lowered.  2/5ths freights. Use.  Scientists have worked out some limits on this.  Can encourage it in private bldg. by licensing if hard-wood is used.

	Can increase its use parallel to increased supply.



R.A.B.	Finance.  £20 m. p.a. = limit of borrowg. on Ldn. market.

	Want discuss O.L. how far sterling balances cd. be used instead.

	Inducements to C.O.  Depends on form of c.p.t.

	On double taxation I can prob. help.



O.L.	Can draw on Internatl. Bank too.



S.	Cd. attract U.S. capital.

P.M.	Want to attract it to U.K.  With guarantees v. natn.

	Preferable to a fiscal system designed to divert it to our Colonies.

	Aim shd. be to get Br. investmt. in Colonies and U.S. investmt. in U.K.



		Agreed :   O.L. and R.A.B. to consult and report on

			     fiscal situation.    Offl. inter Dpl. Cttee on this.



Sw.	Concentrate on areas where we can get quick results.

	Copper for N. Rhodesia is good bet.



O.L.	Transportn of groundnuts in W. Africa, also.



Ch.	Want to be sure we get better result than fr. investment in U.K.



I.	Also in Doms.



S.	E.g. Canada now financed almost wholly from U.S.



O.L.	More sure of Col. because under our control.



P.T.	Must balance all claims and see what wd. suit us best.



L.	Rlways here urgently need steel.



W.	With more groundnuts (steel) we cd. disband machinery for controlling feeding stuffs – which is not working.

						          [Exit Sw. and  Ll. George

						          [Enter P.M.G.

		4.	B.B.C. Charter.



P.M.G.	Much controversy in country and in Party. Suggest 6 months’ extension.

	Can be done by a statement to Parlt.

	M’while consider i)  no major change   ii) finance   iii) Reg. Councils.



J.S.	If you make any change, statement isn’t enough.



P.M.G.	I don’t want any change – even in Govrs.



O.L.	Can the money be divided?



P.M.G.	Yes  : that doesn’t depend on Charter.



R.A.B.	Support : and reserve right, at end of 6 mos. to raise ques. of increased licence fee and get more for Exchequer. (viz., whole of the increase).



H.C.	If it’s a temporary moratorium, don’t say (a) or (c) : wh. aren’t status quo.



P.M.	Support that view.  Need time to get this right.  But don’t alter status quo m’while.



R.A.B.	Opposn. wdn’t boggle at (c).  They proposed it themselves.



P.M.G.	The money won’t be spent.  Wd. go into names for subsequent capital development.



Ch.	Increased fees wd. cut down demand and help defence prodn.



P.M.G.	Policing isn’t v. good : dangerous to put fee too high.



O.L.      	{Take the money.  Painless to public.	     }

             	{Opposition and B.B.C. expect this cut.  }



		Agreed : Extend this cut.	   

			   Cut grant back to 85%

			   Drop para. (a) from any announcement.



P.M.G.	On (a) can I have – direction to my Dpt. that we shan’t consider 2 or 3 B.B.C. Corpns.



P.M.	You can tell Dpt. you are against that.  But it’s open to Cabinet discussion.
