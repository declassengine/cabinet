C.C. 31(52)							18th  March 1952



		1.	Local Government Elections.		[Enter Sw., Ll.G., B-H.



P.M.	Under Secs. and Ministers shd. spk. in Ldn. local elections.



H.C.	Pause before we do this – have never done it before.



A.E.	What about provinces.  Can’t do for Ldn. what we deny to B’ham.



H.C.	While H/C. is sitting can’t do this in Provinces.  Scotland.



P.M.	But this is a critical time.

	Wdn’t advise tht. Cab. Ministers shd. spk. in bye-elections (?)  But someone shd.



M-F.	If you like, I cd. spk – as President of Ldn. Assocn.



P.M.	And 3 or 4 Junior Ministers shd. certainly spk.

	Ch. Whip to organise all this.





		2.	Parliament.



P.M.	Debate on tin and steel.  Who will speak?



Sw.	H. Hopkinson.

	The story is a good one.  He knows all about it.

	Gone thro’ (tin) quicker than expected – and overspent my estimate.



							[Exit B-H.

		3.	Export of Rubber to Russia.



P.M.	B/T. had good answer to S. Dispatch.



P.T.	We agreed to put back 9.000 to 2nd qur.		     }

	to say that this + 6.000 was all they wd. get in 2nd qur.   }

	Told R. about i).

	But M.A.C. have told R. previously tht. 20.000 wd. be max. for 2nd qur. (viz ¼ of annual rate)  U.S. also told.  Shd. we not stick to that figure.



A.E.	50.000 in 1st qur. (includg. 18.000 backlog).  If 20.000 in 2nd qur. then we get too near to years’ total.



P.T.	U.S. have accepted 80.000 + 18.000 backlog.



A.E.	U.S. public won’t wear it; and Govt. will then run away.



Ll.G.	R. have shipped 80% of c. grains.  Always prompt on contracts.

A.E.	Mustn’t go beyond 80.000 (or 98.000 if U.S. fully agree).



O.L.	Indonesia and Ceylon will be tempted to sell more to R. – because U.S. have bn. forcing down the price.



Sw.	Don’t ship more at outset of Congress hearings – even tho’ U.S. Govt. have agreed.  Ques. of atmosphere.



P.M.	80.000 limit (includg. backlog) = 62.000 met.



P.T.	U.S. have accepted 18.000 b-log.



A.E.			{as U.S. have accepted 20.000 for 2nd qur, let it go.

	Agreed.	{But no commitmts. on 3rd qur. and keep it open for us

			{to argue v. b’log.  Room to veer and haul.



								[Exit Ll.G.

		4.	Egypt : Motorised Gendarmerie.



A.E.	As in memo.



Al.	Began opposed to this.  But modified my view.  Our chance of settlemt. lies with Farouk : we shd. back him.  Also U.S. are keen to supply.  Risk tht. they may be used v. us – we can cope with physical risk.



P.M.	A good democratic move!



		Memo. approved.





		5.	Bamangwato : Seretse Khama.



I.	3 point p’mme.  Tshekedi is settled.  R. has gone back.  Now we must settle on Seretse.

	Govr. Jamaica has promised him a good job, subject to consent of his Council.

	Shall we prefer indecisive line of Labour Govt. No immediate row : but continuing trouble in B. Reserve.



	If Jamaican job is clinched, I will see S. and give him 24 hrs. to decide wthr. to abdicate.  Then, go ahead with statement.  After 6 wks. we legislate (O-in-C.) to extinguish his claims.  No Tory is connd. to anythg. inconsistent with this course.



P.M.	Will cause a 1st class row in H/C.



R.A.B.	No future for S. in Africa.



L.P.S.	If we allow the 5 yrs. to run out, our decn. will be the same – and more awkwd. to take it (politically) then and B. Reserve will go on in turmoil m’while.

	I wd. bring this to a head now and face the row in Parlt.

	Can say tht. local situation is not improvg. as Labour Govt. expected.



H.C.	Favour this course.



Al.	View of S. Afr. Govt?  



I. 	This wd. please them.



L.P.S.	App. B.  Paras. 4-5 imply refce. to S.A. views.  We shd. not stress that.  We shd. rely on interests of Tribe.



I.	Agree – wd. like liberty to revise Appendices.



		Agreed :	{Go fwd. with this plan.

				{Submit revised Appendices to Cabinet.

				{Report results of interview with Seretse.



	Will see S.  24/3.  Give him 24 hrs.  Announce 25 or 26/3.



H.C.	Cdn’t have debate until end of followg. week.



I.	Wdn’t mind waiting : will be presenting fait accompli.



H.C.	Isn’t 24 hrs. rather too short.  Will be criticised.



	A.E. and L.P.S. agreed.	Agreed.  Make it 48 hours.



I.	Shd. I tell G. Walker about this?





		6.	Royal Style and Titles.



J.S.	Any other Dom. likely to raise ques. of Eliz. II?



N.B.	We know informally that Canada won’t.



Sim.	Consultn. by mtg. in London?



O.L.	Suggn. – beyond the Seas.  



Sim. 	Will consider it – but doubtful.



P.M.	Unity in variety.



L.P.S.	Lack of uniformity is regrettable, but can’t be helped.

	Stresses divisible Crowns.  Neutrality etc.

I.	Amb. of Irish Rep. says de Val. wants “U.K.” tout court – to avoid mention of N. Ireland.  Promised to bring this to notice of Cab.



		Memo. approved.





		7.	Persia.



A.E.	We wanted a break.  Best chance of getting rid of M.

	U.S. now wholly with us.  Rowntree is converted.

	Chances are better than ever of getting some arrangement.





		8.	Transport Charges.			[Enter Maclay.

								[Exit Maclay.



P.M.	…. Don’t like standing firm on no alternation in shift-workers tickets.



Macl.	Anomalies.  Apply in day as well as night.  Drivers eligible, conductors not.  B.T.C. have acted precipitately and caused trouble.

	But principle of abolition shd. stand.



W.M.	Shd. like to consider this ques.



Macl.	Must uphold impartial independence of Tribunal.  Only protectn v. Govt. acceptg. full responsibility



P.M.	Your reply put too much responsibility on this Govt. for acts of persons nominated by Labour Govt.



Maclay.	Final para. of P.M.’s re-draft.  First sentence wd. be taken as attack on independce of Tribunal.  



[H.C. 	They are judicial body.]



M-F.	Tribunal is not feature of natn.  It existed beforehand.



W.M.	Then dealt only with rlways.  But in principle, no difference.

	It is a judicial body.

	Their decision on shift-workers was presumably deliberate and w’in their competence.



L.	Statement cd. be made about B.T.C. – but not about Tribunal.



M-F.	…. all the functions exercised by B.T.C. were created by the last Govt. and they are ….



L.	No complaint v. Tribunal save prs. tht. they left too much to discretion of B.T.C. – and they acted too precipitately.



H.C.	No one suggests Tribunal is at fault.



Macl.	Is last para. necessary at all in reply to this P.Q.

	We have got it across now tht. this is not a Govt. decision.

	Better not to repeat it in formal replies.

	Further danger – 1/5, when rlways scheme outside Ldn. comes into opern.  Don’t know what B.T.C. plans for this are.  May have to report on that to Cabinet.



Sim.	Avoid suggesting tht. Tribunal is feature of natn.  It is not.



P.M.	Insist on final para. as : [“All these rules were made and] all the functions exercised by the B.T.C. were created by the late Govt. and are a definite feature in the nationalisation policy.”



Macl.	Wd. still prefer to omit that fr. a formal reply.



H.C.	Ministers have put it across in H/C. effectively.



M.F.	“All the relevant stat. provns. …. were result of legn. of late Govt. etc.”

	To avoid [   ].

			Reply to P.Q. – as set out above.



						[Exit Maclay. Enter P.M.G.

		9.	Postal Services.



P.M.	……



P.M.G.	400/500 more men wd. enable me to avoid some of this.

	Increase of 1.800 wd. have left me below authd. establmt.

	I agreed to this on assumptn. tht. it was to be severe  Budget.  V. hard to defend these now I see how gentle Budget is (!)

	Delay in finishing time and dropping 2nd delivery in rural areas

            x/	are the two things I wd. like to avoid.



R.A.B.	There was a loss of £14 m.  We have bridged most of it.  This also was part of plan to save 10.000 on C. Service.

	All this was agreed by H.A. Cttee. 2 wks ago – before Budget was in ques.



	I must continue to press for economies.

	If we restore 400/500 men we don’t get the 10.000 saving in man-power by mid summer.  Wd. cost £100.000.



		Agreed :	Refrain from doing x/.

				Then no need for Parly. announcemt. at all.



							[Exit P.M.G.

		

 

		10.	Economic Survey.



R.A.B.	Merely a factual statement.  Cd. it go to E.P.C. via Cabinet.



P.M.	Let it go to E.P.C. first anyway.  Prs. allow other Cab. members to attend.



		Agreed :  Try it out in E.P.C.  Bring to Cab “if necessary”.
