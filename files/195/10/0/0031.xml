C.C. 17(52)							14th February 1952



		1.	The Funeral.					[Enter B-H.



P.M.	Cd. cars in wh. Cab. go to W’sor be shunted off so tht. they cd. stay in them for ¾ hr.?

	Uniform will be worn by those who wish.  Was not meant to apply to Junior Ministers.





	2.	The Coronation.



P.M.	Advised spring ’53.

	P.M. of N.Z. has said he wdn’t expect Visit before autumn ’53.  Austr. likely to take same view.  Probly. will work out thus.





		3.	Legislative Programme.



P.M.	Better not have Health Bill before Budget.  Put controversial ques. in setting of full plans.  Haven’t got own troops solidly behind us yet.



	Thurs. 21/2	  -	Supp. Estimate

	Tues.  26/2	  -	F.A. debate.

	Thurs. 28/2	  -	Defence debate.



H.C.	Memo. is warning to Cab. of scant time available – and that this will be spent mainly on Bills already in.

	Iron and Steel – long and complex : shd. be ready for Cab. soon.

	Can consider then what to do about it.  No chance of passing before summer recess.

	Delay of Health Bill means financial loss.  Can only begin on 1st of a month.  Cost :  £2 m. a month of delay.



H.M.	Housing Bills.  Shd. try to get them passed.  They deal with increased interest rates.  W’out Bills rents wd. rise by 6/2 automatically. And fears tht. no recoupmt. wd. follow.

	Uncertainty for a year.  Can leave out controversial matters.



J.S.	Herring industry.  Scheme ends Aug.  Some legn. must be passed before then.



M.F.	Visiting Forces.  To give effect to NATO agreemt.  Cd. start in H/L.  



L.P.S.   	Cd. take it.  



A.E. 	Also Geneva Conventns. Bill.



								[Exit B-H.

							[Enter A.H. and C.I.G.S.

		4.	Egypt and Sudan.



P.M.	…..  This means evacuation at once.  Had hoped we cd. merge into 4 Power affair.  A big w’drawal from all we Tories have said.

	Worse than Abadan.



A.E.	This gives away nothing tht. prev. Govt. hadn’t given away already.



P.M.	Shd. we w’draw before 4 Power plan comes into effect.



A.E.	See para. 7.



P.M.	Are we to go, before we can hand over to 4 Power organn. and spend millions on alternative base?



A.E.	Current cost in Egypt is v. large.  



P.M. 	But that wd. be the same.  In addn. new accommn. – capital expense.  Shall be criticised by own supporters and mocked by Opposn.  We have proved tht. we can stay there until internatl. regime is ???? 



A.E.	If we keep base, get joint air arrangemt. etc., public opinion here wd. not be uneasy.  More uneasiness over Sudan proposal.



L.	World wdn’t like Canal left only to E. control.



P.M.	Cdn’t. we reduce size of Forces, but not go elsewhere.



A.E.	Hope tht. in our negotns. we can move into 4 Power area.  Memo. puts worse case tht. they won’t look at 4 Power.  I believe they will.



Ch.	Cdn’t we make our w’drawal contingent on 4 Power coming in?



A.E.	Are you willing to fight it out if they don’t accept.

	Annex I.  Stages I,  II and III.  



P.M.  	These are OK.



A.E.	On Stage IV we wdn’t accept 1 w’out 2.



P.M.	Need we decide now on 1 : a deadly promise w’out certainty of 2.

	We shdn’t promise to go out w’in a year w’out assurance of merging into 4 Power organisation.



A.E.	Urgency.  This Govt. want an agreemt. because they have no popular support : and unless they can show they’ve got something Wafd will come fwd. again.  After 3 months they must have an Election.  We shd. seize this favourable opportunity while it lasts.



	x/. in St. III communiqué.  Wd. be satisfied by w’drawal of some of our additional re-inforcements.  That is intention.



O.L.	“Reduce” vice w’draw.



L.P.S.	Egyptians wd. want word ‘W’drawal’.

	Amr. says action is urgent.  Sitn. likely to deteriorate fr. now on.



A.E.	May I have stages I – III., and re-consider IV in hope of putting in proposal tht. our troops hand over to 4 Power organisation.



H.M.	Omit [   ] from III?



P.M.	Why go beyond I before Lisbon?



A.E.	Give me Stage I and II.

	Let me draft a revised Stage III for approval before I go to Lisbon.



A.E.	Miss this opportunity to talk and prs. you won’t get another.



Sim.	Don’t delay resumptn of negotns.



C.I.G.S.	Our action in E. has won us respect.  We can now negotiate fr. strength.  E. Govt. realise we can’t be scared out.  This is good moment to start negotiation.

	We wdn’t begin by offering to go out in a year.  Wafd is wobbly now : Govt. is friendly : now’s a good time to start – shan’t get a better.



		Agreed :	(Accept I and II.

				(Resume discn. on Monday.



	Sudan.



A.E.	Nothing in 1st alternative.

	On 2nd I don’t like 4(a).  But they say no agreemt. w’out it.

	My objn. : in Sudan it will rally people to their “King”.

	I cd. stand pro tem on para. 1.



O.L.	If nations other than the 3 had seats on Commn. it wd. be v. awkward for me.



A.E.	Wd. keep U.N.O. out of it.  Cd. keep other countries out, perhaps.



H.M.	Start on para. 1. and keep para. 4 up your sleeve.



J.S.	Para. 4 wd. be ill received in U.K.



		Agreed : Start with para.1.

							[Exit A.H. and C.I.G.S.



		5.	Germany.



A.E.		i)	War criminals.	  ii) security safeguards – iii) finance.  There are 		diffies.

		a)  On i) Fr. and Am. don’t like a neutral on the Bd.  We think G. 			wd. prefer our plan : and will prob. say so.  Then we may get 			ours.

		b)  Shd. Bd. settle or advise on clemency.  Wd. prefer them to 			settle.

		Think G. wd. too.  Let Fr. and Am. try : come round, after discn. to our 

		own plan.



P.M.	I agree.  Our plan is best.



A.E.		iii)	Financial.  At Rome we agreed 13 milliard.  G. offered 10 plus, 		but includg. Berlin.  Last night we were told T.C.C. had recommended 		11.25.  U.S. want to lower it.  I want to stand out for 11.25.



R.A.B.	Accept T.C.C. figure.  Best we can get.



A.E.	Based on a fair calculation.



Ch.	£1000 m.  They won’t be able to spend it for 2/3 years.  We can therefore hope for contn. to Occupn. Costs.



		ii)	Security Safeguards.



A.E.	U.S. now ready to allow G. to make civil aircraft.

	Told Acheson we wd. make the aircraft and supply them to G.

	I must try to persuade U.S. to retain this ban.



Ch.	More dangerous than allowg. them atomic prodn.



P.M.	I’m not afraid of G.  That threat’s over.  But agree this wd. cause alarm here.





		6.	European Defence Community.



A.E.	Assurance on Locarno basis to E.D.C.

	U.S. wd. prob. be willing to do this in a statement.  Wd. help if we cd. do it also.

	May I discuss informally with Schuman to see what they want, more precisely?  Wd. bring a memo. to Cab.

	Genl. idea is to say “we shall be v. any member of E.D.C. who misbehaves”.

	“Wd. support E.D.C. v. any one of its members who violated Treaty”.



P.M.	Approve in principle if U.S. will do it.

	If they won’t, we might do it alone.

							[Exit A.E.

		7.	National Registration.



H.C.	Expect, subj. final legal advice, to announce next week identity cards need no longer be carried.





		8.	Steel Prices.



P.M.	Read para. 7 of O.L.’s minute.



O.L.	It is increased cost of imports, not of home costs, that is to be borne by the industry.



D.S.	The prices have not taken a/c of cost of P.M.’s additional 500.000 tons.

	They were agreed with Corpn. before then.

	All we have agreed with Corpn. is prices to off-set £56 m. increase in costs.

	Imported steel doesn’t exclude materials for industry – much is.



O.L.	Acc. to para. 4 you “asked Corpn. to agree” to this.



D.S.	They were asked to agree the price increases agreed before W’ton talks.

	Since W’ton increased home costs are up to £25 m. via £20 m.

	Industry will therefore bear £14 m. on imports + £5 m. on home costs.

	They will therefore bear part of both.



O.L.	Another figure has now changed.



Ch.	(Why can’t we have – cost home prodn.	)

                  x	(			   “   imports.		)  for 1951 and 1952

	(			profits of industry.	)



	All is done in margins.  And they vary daily.



P.M.          *	O.L.’s memo. shd. be circulated.

	Drew attentn to para. 4.



D.S.	Some are excess over existg. Prices: others over proposed new prices.

	Latest : £20-21 (of which £9 is freight) by comparison   “     “      “



Ch.	Can we not now have absolute figures, not differentials?



D.S.	Corpn. as a whole will support these prices.  £4-5-0 a ton.



O.L.	H’to it has bn. quoted as £4 a ton.

	Of course, it helps greatly that Corpn. concur.



D.S.	If all costs taken into a/c it would be £5-15-0.

O.L.	H’to that was said to be £5.

	We are asked to take responsibility, and we have no firm figures.

	Let’s authorise £4 a ton : but let’s have firm figures in future.



Sw.	In giving figures to industry we mustn’t say they carry only cost of U.S. steel.  Say carry £1 of the increase.  Don’t allocate it.  Otherwise they’ll say we have conceded principle tht. they needn’t carry increased home prodn. costs.

	Incentive to buy in U.S. – they will have incentive to buy it at cheaper sources.



P.M.	We can keep out of political trouble, with this.



O.L.	Say industry carries £19 m. of increase – but don’t split it up.



R.A.B.	Believe prices will have to rise again later in year, to finance import fund (BISC).



D.S.	Levy needn’t be found only by prices : cd. come out of profits.

	Industry will increase levy but not out of prices.



R.A.B.	£11. on imports costs : £8 on home costs.  These are my figures.



Ch.	Repeat x/.



				(O.L.    Accept this increase. Don’t announce 			(           divn. betwn house and imports.

		Agreed:	(P.M.   Cherwell and Leathers to check figures  			(           in announcement.



		Steel Export Prices.



R.A.B.	Para. 7 is the answer to allegn.  tht. we sell below import prices.

	On return : £800 oil is obtd. for each ton of steel exported.

	On b/p. £2.000 p. ton of steel. exported – outside B/T. exports.

	Imports fr. elsewhere than U.S. are even higher in price.



O.L.	This shows actual profit is made on our import of dear steel.



Ch.	After raising prices because of imports.

	If we didn’t import, we cd. make more profit.



P.M.	On C.37. are we wise to sell so much when we need it ourselves.



P.T.	On U.S. Steel we make a profit by processing and exporting.

	My memo : only on destinations, not price.

	C.O. and C.R.O. can spk. for themselves.

	Bilaterals.  Sell steel to get materials we need.  Fr. Sweden for quite a little steel we get v. much ore.



P.M.	You cd. still charge a higher price.



R.A.B.	Bilaterals may prevent industry fr. going into some markets when they cd. earn even higher prices.



L.	Also in some cases they wd. put up their prices if we put up ours.

	Often they are selling to us below world price.



P.M.	Are Cab. satisfied?



L.	Yes – but keep under review and take every chance that offers to raise prices.



	U.K. Prices. (resumed).



H.M.	Look at differentials in new prices.  Must go over in bldg. fr. sectional to re-inforced concrete.  Depends on getting enough re-inforcing roads and high tensile steel wire.  Price mayn’t be attractive enough.



D.S.	Am studying this.  Will communicate with H.M.
