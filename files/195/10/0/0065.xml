C.C. 51(52)							8th May 1952



		1.	Trieste.			 		[Enter Sw., B.H.



A.E.	Best we can do.  Brings nearer the day when we can w’draw our troops.



P.M.	Glad Y. will have Pola.  Tito saw Randolph 10 days ago : didn’t seem v. anxious over Trieste : bitter v. Soviet : has eyes on Albania if war comes.



A.E.	Change in para. 8.  Gives too much to Ital. Pol. Adviser as drafted.



		Approved, subject to amendment of para. 8.





		2.	Korea.



A.E.	Consultn. before retaliatory bombing in event of large scale attack.

	To ensure rapid reply, Labour Govt. assumed P.M., M/D., and A.E. wd. act in emergency on Cab’s behalf.



P.M.	No hurry, we will consult Cabinet.





		3.	Exports of Rubber to Russia.



A.E.	Agreed with Ministers concerned.  This is w’in what U.S. wd. accept.



P.T.	Shall soon be talking to U.S. re grain contract.  Must know where we stand.  Recommns. in para. 24.



O.L.	25.000 satellites – 5.000 below what we have supplied.  Hope final decision on that can be delayed – not usually commd. to Soviet.

	Prob. will have to be done, but shock to Malaya if it leaked out now when sharp drop in rubber prices has just occurred.



Ch.	Calculn re civil and mil. uses in R. is not firm : they wd. transfer to mil. use at will.  Doesn’t matter if policy acceptable to U.S.

	But we cdn’t rely on this calculn. in argument with U.S.



P.T.	U.S. accept the posn. re backlog.  No ques. raised on that.



Ch.	Wd. it be worth assuring ourselves tht. U.S. agree on a higher level?



A.E.	Mght invite disagreement.



P.T.	We shall tell them our policy.  



A.E. 	I will consider with B/T. how to tell them.  

P.M. 	Avoid a row with U.S.



R.A.B.	Support this policy.  Coarse grains (pigs) are essential.



Sal.	Ceylon : any limitn. of export wd. be serious.  Cd. U.S. be invited to buy a stipulated amount of rubber fr. them.



A.E.	This memo. puts larger export than last year.



Sal.	Hope there will be quotas.



P.T.	Ceylon doesn’t control shipments now.  I will discuss with Sal.





		4.	Parliament.



Sal.	Debate on Transport in H/L. Wedy.	(Because of Motion on Paper

						(can’t be done.

					    x	[Try to transpose these days.] x



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Wed : F. Affairs.  Thurs : Food and Agric. – on Supply Days.





		5.	Equal Pay.



		Fri :  P. Members’ Motion on equal pay in public services.

		What line do we take?



P.M.	We’ve taken a line in election.  Stick to that.



R.A.B.	Am considering equalising increments, tho’ not pay.  Will report on that.



B.H.	One of our people will put down an amendment we shan’t be able to accept.





		6.	Legislative Programme.



P.M.	Transport Bill.  Present 1/7.  2nd Rdg. 15/7.  By 7/8 get as much done as you can and open Summer recess (aim at that).

	Recess until 13/10 : can’t resume earlier : mustn’t wreck Party Conference.  Sit under 18/12 if necessary (nearly 9 wks.) tho’ aim at 16/12.

							[Exit A.E.

	H/L. cd. meet on 20/1.  H/C. not until 27/1, when they wd. take Lds. amendments.



Sal.	27/11 to 18/12 = 3 wks. + 1 wk. after Xmas.  Might do it.

	Tight fit.



P.M.	Prorogue 5/2.  New Session 10/2.

		7.	Foot and Mouth.			[Exit B-H.

								[Enter T.D.



P.M.	Concerned at policy of slaughter.  Needs review.



T.D.	164 pedigree Jerseys of Iveagh’s have had to be slaughtered.  The compensation has bn. paid, however – and v. promptly.

	On genl. policy we must stand fast.  Have convinced D/W’minster tht. adminn. of policy has bn. approved.

	

	Public alarm is due to w’spread standstill order.

	Since Nov. (the start) 257 outbreaks.  eg. Germany 155.000 in 1951 : or 20.000 in France in 1st qut. of ’52.

	Propose to make a statement in H/C. today.

	Worst area = Cheshire.



L.P.	U.K. is world centre of research on this ques.  Our Dr. Galloway is the accepted world authority.  No cure discovered.



T.D.	2.000 t. meat lost since 14 Nov.  cpd. 1.26 m. consumption – or .02% of consumption.

	Animals : 14.250 cattle, 7.000 sheep, 6.000 pigs and some goats.



J.S.	Sc. pressure to close border on outbrk. in England.  To give more confidence to buyer of export stock.



T.D.	Experts favour single central control, for speed.  Will discuss with J.S.  They were v. quick in spotting this outbreak and Scotland cdn’t have spotted that.



		Policy re-affirmed.			[Exit T.D.

							[Enter O.P., G.Lloyd



		8.	Supplementary Pensions.



W.M.	As in memo.



		i) Present any change as tidying up only.  ii) Find some substitutes for 		the enquiry wh. Labour Govt. had in mind.  Eg. an enquiry of a wider 		kind wh. cd. include it.  Para. 6.



R.A.B.	Range of ii)?  No “Old People’s Charter” incldg. all geriatrics, I hope.

W.M.	No – not so wide as that.



O.P.	Concern at risk tht. pension will become larger than pay.



W.M.	Tidying-up scheme wd. not suffer any long delay.



		Memo. approved.





		9.	Malta : Dockyard Dispute.



P.M.	Deakin says Admy. discriminate unfairly.



W.M.	Govt. and Admiral are both v. increasing the offer.



P.M.	Give what is agreed : but don’t slam the door finally.



W.M.	May hear more of it.  May have to consider then giving more for some concession on their part.





		10.	Wages : Claim by Engineers.



W.M.	Against advice of Executive.  Hope they won’t succeed.

	R.A.B. is seeing N.J.A.C.  I’m seeing employers today to urge them to be tougher.



R.A.B.	Can’t freeze claims.  Must stop exaggerated demands.

	There will be a break in prices eventually and a fall in c/living.

	Some eg. rlwaymen are not getting paid enough.



W.M.	Raising lowest paid infringes on differential.  Must try to tie increases to productivity.



R.A.B.	Leaders are v. friendly.



							                 [Exit O.P.

		11.	Industrial Disputes : Newspaper Industry.



W.M.	V. little chance of settlement betw. firms and Unions.

	Firms won’t welcome Ct. of Enquiry and won’t accept award in advance.

	Unions won’t therefore ask for it, but wd. co-operate if I appoint one.

	Real danger : spreading of dispute.  Have assembled kindred trades at 4.30 pm. today to consider means of avoidg. sympathetic strikes.  P.A. is biggest risk.  If this fails, may have to appoint Ct. of Enquiry.



	Thompson may start action for conspiracy.  Want to appoint my Cttee. before that.



		My plan	i)  seek to limit any spread.

				ii) appoint Ct. of Enquiry if that fails.  (Then it 			will be concerned with wider national interest 			than D.G. Thompson &amp; Co.)



						[Enter de L., Maudlin, Reading.

		12.	Aviation Spirit.



L.	U.S. are cutting by 35% : expect us to follow suit.

	Embargo on export.  Restrict to 65%.  Apl. consumption : lasts 28 days.

	As U.S. helped oil cos. over Abadan, we ought to come into line over this.  Corpns. didn’t like this – loss of traffic.  But U.S. Line’s will suffer.  K.L.M. mght take advantage of this.  Despite this, I advise that we shd. follow suit.  Gesture – shd. therefore be immediate.



P.M.	Mil. aspect.  Important to built up our reserves of aviation spirit.



de L.	110 days’ supply at war time rates worldwide.



L.	Repercussions will not be serious.



G.Ll.	Cut is inevitable because U.S. won’t supply normal amounts.

	What we want is to come in at once in partnership with U.S. on world situation.



R.	U.S. have profited fr. helping us over Abadan.  This shd. be justified on grd. of short stocks, not pleasing U.S.



L.	Our stocks wd. run down v. rapidly if we delayed cut in consumptn.



P.M.	Must avoid drawing on mil. reserves.



		Approved.
