C.C. 64(52).				1st July, 1952.



	1.	Korea.	[Enter  Sw. &amp; Sel. Ll.



P.M.	Rumour last wk. tht. U.S. were thinkg. of using a. bomb on dams

		because of their thickness.  I telegraphed personally to T. 

		deprecatg. this.  T. has replied tht. rumours were unfounded.

		No intentn to bomb the dams, even with H.E.  The power 

		stations were mil. targets because mil. use of power. 

		Necessary for safety of U.N. troops – consistent with policy

		of restrictg. opns to Korea itself.  Wd not depart fr. that policy

		w’out consultn with U.K.

	A re-assuring interchange.



	Statements in Parliament.

	Outstanding ques:  proposal for Br. Ch. of Staff.



Al.	Read extract fr. his proposed statement on this point.



P.M.	Further para. on improvemts. for political liaison – gives some 

		support to vote of censure.  Wd omit that.



Al.	Didn’t we go out to see if arrangemts. cd. be improved.



P.M.	Shd we assume more direct responsibility.



M/St.	Was intended as U.S. political section.



P.M.	That isn’t clear from draft.  And shd. you say it?



Sal.	Cd defend it:  but if it’s U.S. section, doesn’t concern us.



H.M.	Must make it clear it wd. be U.S. section.



P.M.	Read his draft.  15 other nations:  to whom wd. loyalty be due:

		cd. he report secrets home:  etc., … ending “we are studying it.”

		Don’t see any reason to seem too keen on this.

	But if Cab. want to accept this offer, we cd. announce it to-day &amp;

		I will alter my draft – tho’ I will still state some of the limitations.



Al.	Clark wd. welcome it.  U.S. Govt. &amp; Comm. Govts. agree.



P.M.	Prs. surely not to accept it then.



Al.              	i)	If he’s a good man Clark will rely on him to quite a large extent.

                   	ii)	Our liaison intelligence is bad.  If we have a D/C.O.S. he will be

		able to devise proper machinery for that.  We can then get a 

		proper link.



Sal.	His loyalty will be to U.N. Command.

Al.	Yes.



M/St.	Br. C.O.S. will make easier position of our Bouchier (observer) &amp; our

		Ambassador.



Sal.	Can., Austr., N.Z. have agreed.  S.A. haven’t dissented.



M/St.	A.E. wants to accept this.

		

		Agreed:  Approve M/D. draft.  “made available” being 

			              substituted for “appointed”, and para. on pol.

			              section being omitted.

			     P.M. to adjust his draft accordingly.



M/St.	Will then appear tht. Dep. C.O.S. is only measure we have brght. back.

		We felt tht. real weakness in Tokyo is lack of pol. section.  State

		Dpt. agree with us:  Pentagon don’t.



P.M.	See no need to go into that.  Gt. advantage of mission was that an eye

		we trust has looked over the scene.



M/St.	Dening has no chance because Korea is outside his territory.

		Concerned only with Japan.



P.M.	Decision stands – as above.





	2.	Status of N.A.T.O. Military Headquarters.



P.M.	Read my brief.  Any objns?

			

			Approved.



Sim.	In Parlt. greater will include less.  If they have swallowed the earlier

		Bill (as H/L. have) they will take this.



H.C.	There may be trouble.		[Exit  S. Ll.





	3.	Scotland:  Royal Commission.



J.S.	Catto report will be laid before end/month.

	Want at that time to announce we will publ. financial return.

	And then or soon after want to announce R. Commn.

	Believe result of enquiry (viz., publn of return) will damp down

		Sc. nationalism.  Only way to pacify them.

	On R. Commn – para. 7:  t. of r. exclude natd industries – as we 

		contemplate changes in them.     L. agrees.

			

			Memo. approved.

	4.	Civil List.



P.M.	Public impn tht. State is showering wealth on R. Family.

	If we became republic R. Family wd. be twice as well-off as they

		are now.  Is that so?



R.A.B.	Don’t know what their private incomes are.

	They only surrender revenues of Cornwall &amp; Lancaster - £90.000 p.a.

		each.

	The bargain by wh. they surrendered private income was finished long

		ago.

	One ques. outstanding.  Reserve fund of £90.000.  Well accepted by

		R. Family.  Shd it be held by Trustees or handed to Queen.

		Opposn will propose Trustees:  &amp; let them make up

		automatically any deficits in Pts. II &amp; III.  Don’t want public 

		controversy.  Wd sooner agree with Opposn plan in advance.

		The Trustees wd. be Ch/Ex., P.M. &amp; Keeper of Privy Purse.



P.M.	Wd Queen agree?



R.A.B.	They wd. prefer the other method, but wd. accept either.



P.M.	Avoid pol. controversy.
