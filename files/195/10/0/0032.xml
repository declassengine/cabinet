C.C.18(52)							18th February 1952



		1.	Name of Royal House.		[Enter Sw. and Dugdale



P.M.	Q. Mary distressed.  German Prince staying at B’lands heard M’batten say name was M.  I wish to give personal assurance in favour of no change from House of Windsor.  Deliberate mark of B. character of ruling House.

	

	General view of Cabinet – Windsor.





		2.	Germany.



		Took note.





		3.	N.A.T.O.



		Took note.





		4.	Europe.



A.E.	“Condns.” in Fr. and G. – exptd by Sch. and Adenauer as wishes, not condns.



	Alarm is therefore undue.  Not impossible.

	War Criminals.  Tribunal of 6 : 3 Allies and 3 Germans. For in end Ad. didn’t want neutral.  Fr./Bel./Dutch have war crim. whom they haven’t tried.  Sch. undertook to discuss that direct with Adenauer.

	Thus this will be settled today.



	Finance.  11.25 given to Ad. – taken it quite well, but can’t commit himself.  Said ready to open discns. in Bonn at once and agree a figure by end/week.  If a reasonable figure, we can then get on at Lisbon to divide it up betwn. Allies, who all want occupn. costs for ’52 out of it.



	Security Control.  Fr. want resln on heavy artillery and propellants.

	We are all short of latter : wd. be sensible for G. to make it.

	Mtg. at 3 pm. to settle that.  If we can get them out, rest of list wd. be acceptable to A.  Civil aircraft : G. don’t intend E. make : if that is confirmed and declared and promise given to consult us before they do, we shd. be content.  U.S. won’t support a more definite resln.



	Relations of N.A.T.O. and E.D.C. – meet together whenever either asks or any member asks for joint mtg.  Gives G. right to ask for a joint mtg. even before they are members of N.A.T.O.  Hope Fr. will agree.  Will tell them tht. if they refuse, will be difft. to resist fr. pressure for admn. to N.A.T.O.

	Locarno declaration.  Draft statement (U.K./U.S.) prepared.

	But I’m disposed twds. separate U.K. statement – for our relation to Europe is different.  Agreeable to Adenauer.

	U.S. can follow later : may take them some time to come along.

	This won’t commit us to more than Art. 4 of N.A.T.O.



P.M.	Take care.  U.S. might not follow.  Use this to press U.S. to join in more quickly.  Or two, but simultaneous.  Let’s have somethg. fr. U.S. even tho’ it mayn’t go so far.



A.E.	If we lead on this, wd. do us good.  Admit we had better have it firm tht. they will follow suit.  With something.



P.M.	OK. – subject to that.



A.E.	I will see how it goes.



H.M.	In view of our record on Eur. Army, if we cd. make this separately it wd. do us good, both abroad and at home.  Wd. help our political position.

						[Enter A.H., C.I.G.S.



		5.	Egypt.



		Draft communiqué.



P.M.	Words re Sudan can stand.  On basis tht. its as stated in despatch.



A.E.	Opinion might be inflamed by it.

		I will tell Amb. we wd. rather not have it in : but after further reference 		he may concede if he must.  Leave it out and give this expln.



Sal.		Substitute “and an agreement on other outstanding issues” as 2nd line.

			Draft telegram approved.



A.E.		Drew attn. to supplem. letter of 16/2 to Stevenson.



P.M.		Para. 8.  Para(2) gives away a lot.



A.E.		In order to transfer it to F. Powers.



M.		£300 m.  Shd. we not be paid for what other Powers take?



R.A.B.		“Free of cost” – does this mean free of profit to us.

		We shd. get somethg. fr. this asset.



C.I.G.S.	a)  The base.  b)  The contents.  b) are ours.  We shd. make it clear we 		don’t hand b) over to anyone, even F. Powers.  That will be British.



A.E.		Para. 8(2) – says “installations”, which means only (a).

		Agreed : make it clear 8(2) doesn’t cover contents.

		Remember tht. it’s only with E. consent tht. we can win for the 4 			Powers a right to come in to Canal Zone.  At present we are only 			Power wh. has a Treaty right to be there.

		Want to bolster up this Govt. get agreement with them and so let the 4 		Powers in.  Once they have an establd. legal right to be in, more diff. 		for Wafd to turn them out.



P.M.		There shd. be no inter-regnum betwn. our leaving and F. Powers taking 		over.



L.P.		Suppose we don’t make agreemt., Wafd returns, where are we?



P.M.		We hang on, holding firm.  Recent experience shows we can.



C.I.G.S.	We can’t occupy Cairo and Alex. without re-inforcements.



A.E.		We were told at the crisis tht. Rodeo was impracticable.



Sim.		Suggested amendmts. to 8(2) pencilled on my copy.



L.P.S.		Wdn’t it be easier to start 4 Power negotns.?



A.E.		U.S. urged us to begin discns – easier to start á deux.

		F. Power proposals are even more dependent on E. goodwill, than 			these are.  



C.I.G.S.  	None of the other Powers wd. keep troops in E. in peace.



M.F.		Para. 8(7) makes it clear tht. all in contingent are accepting F. Power 		basis.



A.E.		Intentn. is tht. all para. 8. stands together.  If we can’t get (7) we aren’t

		committed to any of the other paras.



P.M.		Can’t settle this now.



			Resume discussion 10 am. Tuesday.
