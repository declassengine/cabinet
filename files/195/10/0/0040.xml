P.M.	Cd. you not have passed out notices explaining it wasn’t our fault.



L.	Transport Tribunal operated in same way before natn.

	This time they took 11 months over this.  Some adjustments downwards as well as increases.



P.M.	Does Govt. not know in advance?  



L.  	No.



L.	Changes coming along on gas and electricity charges.

	Transport changes are now complete.



Ch.	Govt. have little power over these Bds.

L.	Considering that.



P.M.	Let Cab. have a critique of findings of Transport Tribunal.



L.P.S.	Powers of irresponsible bodies – dangerous.  Need for review.



W.M.	Successor of Rlway Rates Tribunal.  They must be regarded as impartial tribunal.



L.	Can make a statement bringing out facts – independence of Tribunal.

P.M.	And delay it for a week or so.



H.M.	Consult me too.





		6.	Import Cuts.



R.A.B.	Anxiety re military preparedness – and sugar.



P.M.	Military.	(i)	Wheat





A.	If war comes, imports v. diff. in 1st few months.  In ’39 stocks at 13 wks. as they stand now.  Involves a big risk.  Wd. accept the risk on meat.

	Cd. you get the wheat fr. Canada and pay them later.



R.A.B.	Wd. work out as not buying pro tem.



A.	C.O.S. are v. apprehensive about this.

	

Ch.	Our harvest wd. be in before war is likely to start.



P.M.	Cd. we express this as temporary reduction in stocks.



I.	We assumed need for such stocks in ’39.  But in event there was no diffy. for 8/9 months.



L.P.	Big drop in stocks at outset of ’39. because cdn’t get the wheat in.

	Mght. have to live on reserves for several wks.



Ch.	Home harvest = 11/15 wks’ supply.



P.M.	(Put it : no further importns until we see how we stand on the harvest.

	(A. to consult C.O.S.  A gradual run-down to point of biggest danger before U.K. harvest.

	And have it understood tht. 13 wks. is our aim.

	R.A.B. can assume a saving of £9 m.



	(ii)  Canned Meat.



Ll.G.	40.000 t. reserved for military in 1st 6 months.  10.000 t. civilian reserve.

	Mil. wd. eat it.



R.A.B.	Wd. not announce our stock figures.		Agreed.



	(iii)  Sugar.



Ll.G.	¼ t. p.a. cut already imposed.  No dollar saving until ’53 because committed.

	If we cut sugar : meat, shall be below any known level.

	Loss of efficiency must be expected.  Below 2.800 calories : 2.900 is accepted safety minimum.

	Means cutting canteens in heavy indies.  May provoke demand for differential rationing.



R.A.B.	I didn’t take a/c of meat, or propose to cut it.

	If we can’t pay for the meat, we will restore sugar ration later.



Ll.G.	Of original cuts 50% fell on food.  On this plan, 45% is on food.



Ch.	Only 3% of total imports – whole plan.



R.A.B.	Can’t take whole weight on stocks.  Must make some cut in rations.



L.P.	May give impn. of sacrifice : but will cause discontent, and will threaten efficiency.

	Politically : meat must be less.  Doubt if we can have ration at all in 6 months’ time.



O.L.	June = crisis month.  This helps only in ’53.  Cd. wait – except for psych. reasons.



Ll.G.	The variety in diet (fr. Europe) is now going to disappear.



W.M.	If it brings no benefit until ’53, it wd. be wrong to diminish energy of workers this summer.



	Oils and Fats.



R.A.B.	Miscellaneous.  I wd. be content to reduce to £2 m. in dollars and let the other £3 m. go.



Ll.G.	This wd. be Canadian canned salmon.  V. difficult.



	Softwood.



Sw.	Wd. reduce to 3 or 4 mos. supply.

	Offer £18½ m. on pulp, paper and softwood, with discretion of virement.



	Accept £3½ m. cut on hardwood.



H.M.	Effect?  



Sw.  	By June ’53 softwood stocks wd. be 3 mos. war consumptn.



Sw.	And v. diff. cargo to ship, in war.

	Trade must be told w’in a month how much of the remaining 150.000 they can order.

	I wd. prob. prefer to take most of the weight on paper and pulp.



Sw.	What we buy in 1st half of ’53 must be decided in a month or two.



H.M.	Can I be kept informed re effect on housing p’mme.



Sw.	Seen Chairman Commn.  Wd. sell Sudanese stocks and buy less of others.



	Reduced stocks wd. suffice if textiles go no faster than now.  If there were a boom, we shd. hold back the last 10 m.  

P.T.  	Agreed.  



Ch. 	Then we cd. afford it because of improvement in exports.



	Tobacco.



P.M.	Aim at reducing consumption.  Increase tax because we have big internal surplus.

	Good to say : food at lowest war time levels and now we shall reduce consumptn. of tobacco – partly by deferring surcharge and partly by increasing tax.



Ch.	Its not a genuine surplus.



R.A.B.	Other indirect taxn. wd. be reqd if revenue on this fell.



		Tobacco    :	Agreed.



	Machinery Manufacturers – agreed.



	Europe.



P.T.	Deficit with E.P.U. has come down to £22 m. last month and we are at the moment in surplus.  Don’t want to bust it now.

	Suggest removg. fr. o.g.l. a list of articles : brk. no contracts, but issue no more licences on that list for a month.  Consider risk of retaliation.

	If we announce a figure, we shall bust E.P.U.  Avoid threatening figures even for textiles.



P.M.	Wines.  



R.A.B.  	£12 m. in all.  At most mght. get £1½ m. off (or ? in tax but at cost of gt. diffy. with Comm. and grave threat to Fr. economy.

	Wd. sooner say tht. we avoid this deliberately on that a/c.



S.Ll.	A.E. feels v. strongly in favour of this view.



P.T.	Machinery.  V. diff. to run licensg. system.  Prefer to deal with it by removg. free of import duty concession + other measures proposed by R.A.B. on depreciation allowces. etc.



R.A.B.	….. wd. like to include it in standstill agreemt.



P.T.	Means 100 staff to examine individual applns.  We shall get results by other means.



R.A.B.	Must rely on £20 m. saving on Europe.  Can I?



P.T.	Can work twds. posn. of balance with Europe.  Can’t get it before June.

	No cancelln of existg. contracts.

R.A.B.	We have paid more than $300 m to E.P.U.



		Agreed :	Aim at £20 m. on para.10, but on B/T. lines.



	Sugar.



P.M.	On reflectn. I’m against doing sugar.



		Agreed. No cut on sugar.  Misc. reduced to £2 m.



R.A.B.	Must aim at £100 m. – relying on £20 m. fr. Eur.



P.T.	Don’t talk about Eur. too harshly until we see posn. at end/March.



	A. to carry C.O.S. on military items.
