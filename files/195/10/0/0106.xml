P.M.	b)  Peer’s Coaches.  Let Earl Marshal consider again wtr. those who

		wish to use them may not do so.



Sim.	c)  Seats in Abbey.  Propose another 30 for H/L. and another 40 for

		H/C. – at expense of Services etc.

		at a lesser figure.			}Agreed.

	N. cd. then go ahead on H/L.  Further delay to 25/11,	}

		to canvass opinion in H/C.

	Earl Marshal to be asked to broaden repn of women’s

		organisations.			Agreed.

	Repn for employers – only 16.  M/W. asks for 50.  W.M.

		supported:  won’t compare with 22 for natd indies and 60

		for T.U.’s and 6 for Co-ops.             Agreed:  recommend 40,

		or more if natd indies can do with less.



D.E.	H/C. seats.  [690 - ] betwn. 546 M.P.’s who are not P.C.’s = 1.000 with

		wives:  900 likely to want to come.  Cdn’t therefore avoid ballot,

		and that wd. cause gt. ill-feeling.



Sal.	Wrong argument:  they are M.P.’s.



D.E.	Leaves a gap of 350, which ever way you do/sum.



B.H.	M.P.’s think they have an even better ‘right’ to attend than Peers.

		That’s why we asked for delay to canvass opinions – many

		with young children may prefer 4 seats (free) outside – prs.

		plus view of dress rehearsal.

de L.	Not same thing.



A.H.	Tournament will be a Coronn do – with Dom &amp; Col. troops as central

		feature.  They will be v. disappointed if Queen can’t attend.

T.D.	I. Govt. wdn’t allow owners to discuss.  They have now agreed to

		discns in Commn under Over-Fishing Convn &amp; m’while to send

		experts to explain to U.K. owners.  Our men won’t lift the ban 

		on basis of that offer.  Grimsby men have said they will stop

		fishing when I. trawler lands fish at Grimsby.  We are trying to

		avert open breach.

		negotns pending.



Ll.G.	V. diff. operation of de-control.  Some risks.  Remove subsidy on

		flour:  may have to rise price of bread by 1d because temptn

		of switchg. fr. one to other.  Tough in price review to prevent

		compensatg. them for increased price.



R.A.B.	Wd mean raising bread subsidy to £40 m.  But net saving of at least

		£17 m.  We can discuss later how we deal with bread – may not

		be necessary to raise price.  Don’t wait for Budget:  do it in

		ordinary course of agric. policy.  Greater risk than bread is

		increased imports.



P.T.	Wish to discuss price support problems before announcement.
