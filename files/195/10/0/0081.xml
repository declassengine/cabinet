C.C. 68 (52)					14th July, 1952



1.	Iron &amp; Steel Industry.

    [Enter D.S., B-H., Sw.



P.M.	Special mtg. because understand some members felt they hadn’t suff. opportunity to express their views.



Sal.	Grateful for this opportunity.

	Serious misgivings, not on merits of Scheme to wh. we are pledged, but on timing.  Serious warnings of immed. econ. prospects.  Import cuts &amp; more drastic measures still – wh. mght. affect standard/living.  Must therefore further spirit of national unity, or at least avoid further dividing it.  Some signs of improved feeling eg. Deakins speeches.

		Efforts of R.A.B. &amp; M/L. are bearing fruit.  This Bill wd. cause gt. division of opinion.  We are not pledged to do this now.  Implementn of election pledges must take a/c of subsequent events.

	Some wks ago I urged tht. on these grounds both Bills shd. be deferred.

		Too late now to p’pone T. Bill.  Cd. however defer Steel.

	Wd. deepen rift betwn. Parties at a critical time.

	Shall we succeed in selling assets back?  No evce tht. we shall.

		Some indicns (opinion) tht. we shan’t.  If this fails, we shan’t have de-nationalised.  And failure wd. be regarded as gt. disaster.

	Max. irritn  with minimum result.



W.M.	B/P. is to have 1st priority – dangerous situation.  20% increase in exports.  Can’t hope to achieve that w’out fullest support fr. labour.

	Anxieties

a)	wages:  may price us out of export mkts.

b)	strikes in any major industry:  climate not v. satisfy.

Feeling of controversies in transport:  E.T.U. may bring politics into power status:  A.E.U. &amp; docks.  Wd. prefer therefore to avoid controversy.

	T. Bill.  Hope we shall be ready to make concessions to reduce opposn while m’taining essentials.

	S. Bill. Second controversy &amp; some bitterness.

		Is it now or never, for that Bill?  I hope not.

		Is it worth the risk?  Shall we sell assets?  How much desire for it?

		Wd. much sooner p’pone controversy.



Sw.	Can manage T. Bill:  chance of selling assets.

	But on Steel: shall we succeed?  Bill ending in fiasco will help no-one.  Chance of returng. assets to pre-enterprise seem small.

		Are we certain tht. any firms will buy back?  Outside investors (insurance cos., trust cos., pension funds) are doubtful: have they bn. sounded?  What prospect tht. eg. Prudential will buy?  Surely we shd know before we go on.

	Threat of Opposn to reverse it.  We cdn’t provide in Bill any guarantee v. this, by compensn or otherwise.

	Bill may be followed, after gt. controversy, by a fiasco.

	Why commit ourselves now, by issue of W. Paper.

	Leave it open until autumn.



L.P.	Can R.A.B. tell us what the City thinks re sale.



P.M.	Had A.E.’s views (written) read.



R.A.B.	Controversy – E.P.L. &amp; T. Bill – is such tht. Steel Bill won’t make it worse.  E.P.L. infuriated many who will be made even more angry if we don’t go on with Steel.  That is view of F.B.I. repd to me.  Our pledge on Steel was so firm tht. we must do it. tho’ I’m not commd on time.

	City.  They evolved the Agency Scheme.

	Period:  many years before complete sale can be finished.



L.P.	A major share sold wd. be all right.  V. little wd. be disastrous.



R.A.B.	Not more than 1/3rd in near foreseeable future.

	But depends on state of market.  Tho’ you can’t expect to sell much of this in a hurry.

	Insurance cos. at present aren’t keen.



Sim.	What evil fr. going on?  Disunity – when unity so sorely needed.

	If 1/3rd sold only, it wd. be a terrible flop.  Confusion in industry.

	Any way of p’poning it shd. be embraced.



P.M.	May not secure unity.  May only be mocked, for flinching.



D.S.	Believe we must go ahead.

	Courses.

a)	P’pone decision until autumn.

b)	Announce soon abandonment of denationalisn.

c)	Seek to negotiate settlement w’in the industry.

a)	Gt. loss of prestige wd. be involved by (a). Widely known tht. announcement is impending e.g. by T.U.C. Ll.Davies.  Recent P.Q. by Strauss.

If we say nothg., we shall be known to be wavering.  Fedn will make outcry.

If we then went fwd., it wd. be said we were run into it by industry &amp; b. benchers.

Industry wd. assume we had abandoned de-natn.  Fedn wd. give up their resistance to Corpn.  Managements wd. accommodate themselves to natn.  Vickers &amp; others who have kept capital to re-invest wd. invest it elsewhere.  At best, we shd. prolong uncertainty in industry.

b)	Firm pledge, confirmed since we took office by P.M. and members of Cab.  We shd. be breakg. that.  Strong feeling in Party, who want us to go fwd.  T. &amp; Ind. Group have bn. given, by me, categorical assurance tht. we are going on.  Wd. shake Govt’s foundn with b. benchers unless we cd. give promise on (c).

c)	Best answer if it were possible.  Compromise tht. wd. take into a/c diffies of sale &amp; need for certainty in industry’s future.

Is it possible?  Sure we can’t get it, if we show hesitn.  Our only hope is to declare our policy firmly.  From firm posn on their side &amp; ours we may be able to negotiate – not from hesitation.

Once Labour see we mean to go on – with, I think, Lib. support – they may be ready to negotiate to save some of their own work. W’in last 3 days have talked to Ch. of Corpn (Green), who has come a long way.  He thinks he cd. carry Corpn with him on basis tht. Corpn sell off, under Act, any activities not w’in Sch.II: no creation of Agency:  Bill to enable Corpn to sell more than they now can:  Bd. shd. be created &amp; Agency be no more than shareholding.



P.M.	Urgency – Session ending.

	Announcemt. of abandonment will not earn good will.

	Read pledge in Br. Strong &amp; Free.

	Is there any need to incur charge of breach of faith?

	R.A.B. doesn’t think this will imperil b/paymts. effort.

	How does this compare with cuts in def. p’mme? and imports?

	If we abandon this, Tory Party will be rent.

	This is normal Party row compd with gt. national issues over b/paymts.

		Natn was act of partisanship – H/L. veto cut down to allow of it.

	If we go ahead, we fulfil pledges:  by presentg. W. Paper.

	Effect on Steel industry of uncertainty.  Ellis Hunter said – there is uncertainty now, developmt held back:  suppose this to be contd to ’53 or ’54.  L. Evans, who wd. support, won’t be there much longer.

	Publn of W. Paper won’t make pol. relns any worse.

	P’ponement will certainly discourage industry.

	Can we go on governing w’out a theme.



H.M.	Agree with R.A.B. &amp; D.S.

	We might have taken non-Party, unity, line in March &amp; dropped both Bills.  Can’t do it now.

	S.Bill is not re-actionary – on managemt. side it’s almost Socialist.

	If we abandon it  now, we shd. get no thanks but only be repd as irresolute.

						[Exit H.M.



O.L.	Econ. crisis was with us earlier:  no excuse for not going on now.

	Natl unity won’t be achieved by this.

	“Confusion in industry” – worse by recanting on pledges than on going forward.

	Too late now to turn back.



M-F.	Favour going fwd.

	No gain in natl unity by abandong. this &amp; going on with T. Bill.

	Won’t cause indl unrest in my view.

	Pessimism re sale. is serious.

	But abandon this &amp; we shall strike blow v. all faith in for. enterprises.

We must give a lead to those who believe in it.  Or it will be lost as a principle.  This outweighs diffies of sale.

	If we don’t go fwd. quickly we can’t get our solution w’in this Parlt.



H.C.	Future of Parly system if gt. Industies are to be victims of Party changes.

	What do people mean by natn. – ownership. No P.M. is prepd to compromise on that.  If so, only one form of natn v. another.

	Prefer, if there is hope of compromise, not to nail our colours to mast.  Esp. if we know we shall fail to sell.

	Why not wait &amp; see how we get on with selling the lorries?

	Favour no publn of W. Paper &amp; seeking to lift the industry out of politics.  Can’t be certainty in industry when Labour have threatened to reverse everythg. once again.



P.M.	Even if you can’t sell in 1954 or 55, we can get agreed scheme of managmt.



H.C.	That won’t redeem our pledge.

	Better to work twds. industrial &amp; pol. compromise.  And easier to do that w’out a W. Paper.  



P.M.	That is tactics, not principle.



Al.	May have bn. unwise to give pledge.  For now seen to be v. diff. to sell.

But Party is committed.  Can’t w’draw.  Choice is only between now or later.  Don’t wish to give opinion on timing.



L.P.	Don’t believe we can buy political peace by this gesture.

	If when econ. crisis first announced we had said we wd. avoid all controversy we might have obtd unity.  But we have decided to go on with T. Bill &amp; that is more controversial.

	Doubt wisdom of compromising on our opposn to natn , wh. binds us together.



L.	Steel industry have w’drawn because reluctant to buy back.

	But, despite disapptmt over that. we must go fwd. – publish W. Paper &amp; be ready to negotiate then, after showg. no hesitation.



Ch.	Go fwd. Doubtful about timing.  Agreemt. wd. be best.

Can’t say wtr. this is more or less likely if W. Paper is publd first.



P.T.	We shd. seek a compromise.  Can’t see how publd wd. serve that purpose.  Wd. be taken as gauntlet.  And if we compromised later wd. be called another retreat.

	We shan’t be able to sell.



Sal.	Main issue is not one of principle – mainly timing.

	In politics, timing &amp; tactics are of v. gt. importance.

	Balance of importance.  P.M. said cuts were much more important &amp; this only a scrap btwn. Parties.  Can’t accept that.  Public ownership ques. is fundamental to us &amp; to Labour.

Is this the time for a scrap on that?

	In H/C., true, no prospect of a spirit of unity.  But that’s not true of country, who are beginning to be worried.  M/L. says tht. to go on with this will tend to create industr. unrest.

	Only by makg. it clear we stand for unity can we hope to win support for the cuts.

	Pledges.  We can’t fulfil now because we can’t sell.  What is right moment for us.  We aren’t commd to do it now.  We don’t always fulfil our pledges [e.g. repeal of T. Dispute Act]

	On alternatives of D.S. we don’t advocate (b).  Nor tht. we say nothing.  But tht. in econ. crisis we have decided to p’pone doing this.

	Principle of pr. enterprise.  I believe it will be more damaged by trying this &amp; failing.

	A.E. seemed to favour seeking agreement first.



D.S.	L. Evans, tho’ he will say nothg. publicly, is 80% in agreement with our scheme.



Sal.	My view does not proceed from “lack of courage”.



P.M.	I meant only that it wd. be so represented, in controversy.

	Favour early publn of W. Paper.

	We can then go on with search for agreemt.

	We shall certainly be represented as “undecided” if we don’t.



Sw.	Emphasis now to measure of agreemt. on managemt.  And we doubt if we can sell.  Shd. we not reverse order of presentn in W. Paper.



Al.	If W. Paper is expected, shall seem to be vacillating if we defer it.



W.M.	If we are faced with econ crisis, embitterment will be risked because of impending mtgs. of T.U. conferences.



D.S.	P’ponement now wd. = p’ponement until after Genl. Election.



Sim.	Wd. it not help to secure unity if p’ponemt. offered after R.A.B.’s statement?



L.P.	Not unless you w’draw T. Bill also. 



P.M.	And that wd. mean no controversial legn &amp; Govt. w’out a theme.



R.A.B.	I took econ sitn into a/c when I decided in favour of going on.  Credit 

	here and abroad, wd. not be assisted by p’poning this.

	Better qua economic situation, to go on.
