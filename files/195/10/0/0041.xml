C.C. 27(52)							7th March 1952



		1.	Increased Transport Charges.		[Enter Maclay.  O.P.



P.M.	Concerned at H/C. disquiet.  Suggested announcemt. makg. it clear tht. Govt. are not responsible.

	

	Text read out.  Approved.  Issue to Press this pm.





		2.	Government Information Services.



P.M.	Deputatn  from 1922 Cttee. y’day.  L.P.S. Cttee?



L.P.S.	One rpt. submd.  Another (on C.O.I.) under considn.  Ty. enquiry proves economy of a central agency.  Will submit recommn. to Cab.



P.M.	But change personnel : esp. head of it.

	Impressive deputn (Maitland, Ian Harvey, Bicker White).  Complained of presentn. eg. of increased milk prices – announced by 2 Dpts. on separate days in inconsistent ways.



L.	Announcemts. of increased gas and electricity charges – unco-ordinated.



L.P.S.	Is this a job for Central Office?  Shd. their Cttee. not keep in touch with Dpts. – to put colour on Dpl. factual announcemts.

	My Cttee. wasn’t intended to be a continuing one.  Presume it will be wound up.

	

						[Exit Maclay.

		3.	National Insurance Rates.



O.P.	Suggn. after Budget I shd. meet both sides of industry.  Want authy. to discuss with them age of 67.  If I cd. get that agreed i) I cd. raise benefits to 1946 value.  ii) wd. reduce future burden on fund.  iii) wd. help national economy.

	To avoid hardship, cd. offer slightly better than now rate for those who opt to go at 65 – for a few years.

	Budget statement shd. be such as to ease negotiatns.



R.A.B.	Not convinced about Ty.  Major change.  Pro : you can finance higher benefits w’out more public money.  Con : weekly contn. wd. have to be raised.  Wd. like O.P. to try it.  If he gets agreement, I wd. support.  But politically v. difficult.

	I cd. spk. in Budget in such a way as to leave it open to negotiation.

	Choice is betwn. 67 age and 65 + increments for extra years.



W.M.	Fits in with our attempt to increase working age.

	Diffy. on timing.  Some short time unemplt. threatens elderly.

	But even so, fits our long-term aim.  Well worth negotiatg. on it.

	Even at 67 want it as a minimum not normal age.



P.M.	Increased longevity requires longer working life – or pension burden on young will be intolerable.



L.	25.000 miners entitled to go this year – only 4.000 have done so.



O.P.	50% of popn. go on after 65, as at now.



Ch.	In 25 yrs. £500 m. will be price of existg. scheme, if unaltered.



		R.A.B. to consult O.P. on form of Budget statement.



H.C.	Uniformity of benefit rates was aim.

	If O.P. gets o.a.p. to 36/=, will that drag up the other rates.



O.P.	Unemplt. rate can’t be left lower, for then there wd. be inducemt. to retire.  And health shd. follow.

	Fund is at £1100 m.  [Lost £50 m. on “Daltons”.]



R.A.B.	It is compuls. national savings.  Can’t draw on it w’out inflationary effect.



P.M.	Say “want advice and assistce.  of T.U.’s on this” – don’t say “negotiate”.

	I prefer increment basis. The others cd. be represented as re-actionary or even breach of faith.



O.P.	Cd. consider extending option beyond initial 2 or 3 years.



P.M.	Let me be kept informed of progress of talks with T.U.C.



O.P.	2¼ m. now on p. ass. – 1 m. of them supplemtg. insurance benefits.

	Want to increase benefits in order to reduce those numbers.  That is why I don’t mind dragging up unemplt. and sickness benefits consequentially.



H.M.	That only reflects increased prices.



O.P.	But dangerous to Party if 3-4 m. are subjected to means test.

	Whole future of insurance is in jeopardy.

								[Exit O.P.

							

		4.	Defence Programme.		[Enter 3 Serv. Min. M/S., M/F., 							 Readg.  Sw.



Al.	Examd. contns. wh. won’t jeopardise security of U.K. or efficiency of

	Forces.  If we have to save more, we shd. cut into efficiency eg. by reducg. heavy A.A. equipmt.  This is now best we can do short of that.

P.M.	Good economy on heavy bridging.  Why not suggd. earlier.



A.H.	We shd. have no bridges a heavy tank cd. cross on.



P.M.	Cd. bring them over on rafts.



A.H.	Leaves us enough for 20 equipmts.  14.000 t. remain to us for this.



P.M.	For new heavy form of tank.  Only 1.000 t. allocated.

	How many will you have.  



A.H. 	25 this year and 120 in ’53.



P.M.	Large steel cost for v. small no. of weapons.  



A.H. 	Other vehicles can use these bridges.  



Al. 	Leaves 10 sets, out of 60 planned – ample for experiment and training.



Al.	Centurions.  Can manage another 100.  Puts back by 6 months supply to T.A. formns – thou’ they will have enough to train on.



A.H.	Engineering equipmt.  This is bull dozers etc.

	Jerricans.  Don’t like this cut.  We are v. short.



O.L.	V. necessary.  We lost 30% of all petrol in M/E. before jerrican introduced.



D.	Bombs : speculation.  Cost £25 m.  Hope to see for £1.5 m.

	Scrap value wd. be about that.

	Vehicles : represents cut of about 50% of non technical vehicles.



D.S.	Swifts.  P’mme of 175 for R.A.F. : then gap before a naval type comes in.  Proposed therefore to run it on and make 200 for U.S.



P.M.	Won’t fly until end ’53.  Nothing now in squadrons equal to MIG.15.

	Frightened of giving away anything wh. our squadrons cd. use.



D.S.	All R.A.F. requiremts will be met first.



D.            x/.	Quite a chance U.S. wd. allocate them to R.A.F.



Al.	Cdn’t production be speeded up?



P.M.	I will accept this on basis i) our orders are filled first and ii) x/.



Ch.	Hutting.  Hope steel can be saved on this.  It’s contingent on moving base in M/E.  Also try to use reinforced concrete via steel.



D.S.	We cd. get more on this.  60.000 t. going this year into hutting.

	£3 m. cost cd. earn £24 m. as exports.



A.H.	That’s not all W.O.  Ours is i) l/c in Europe, with Belgian steel.

	ii) M/E.  iii) A.A. equipmt. in U.K.  Have called for further review : economy.

	M/E. need is in Cyrenaica and Tripoli, where we have no huts now.



Sw.	Specificns re storage – steel economy – shd. be looked at further in Steel Econ. Cttee.



H.M.	60.000 t. = steel in 170.000 houses!



P.M.     *	Review hutting and storage with aim of reducg. this by 30.000.  *

	(M/Def. to organise this)



	Oil.



Al.	Deferred.



J.P.L.T.	6 mos. reserve.  Seekg. 800.000 t. more this year.  Accept 500.000 t. with saving £3½ m. 



L.	This was sole Admy. contn.  Existg. stock exceeds by a little a 6 mos. stock.

	Believe 400.000 t. this year wd. suffice.  Wd. bring it to 9½ mos. stock.

	Saving £5 m. - £2 m. on oil and £3 m. on freights.  And 80% of freight.





		5.	Investment in Plant and Machinery.



R.A.B.	If Cab. dislike this, we must rely on Bank rate.



P.T.	I wd. like this – avoids licensing of machinery.



Ch.	Forced loan.  



O.L.  	But fr. people who are v. short of cash.



R.A.B.	Not essential to do this.  



W. 	Don’t like it.  



H.C. 	Too much.



P.M.	Undoes what you intend to do on E.P.L.



P.T.	Wd. not be tolerable for long.



		Agreed : don’t do it.			[Exit D.S.



		6.	Flour.



R.A.B.	Manufrs. are w’drawing flour.  M/F. want restn. scheme introduced on Sunday.  Must we do this before Budget?



Ll.G.	Forestalling – has bn. going on for a week.



W.	Now can do this sort of thing only on Monday.



R.A.B.	Will provoke comment – and may suggest what’s coming in Budget.



Ll.G.	Don’t press it.

							[Exit LL.G.



		7.	Utility.



P.T.	Main point will disappear when R.A.B. alters purchase tax.

	Propose safeguard thro’ B.S.L. the main specifications wh. are still useful.  Industry agrees.  Not on a v. large range.

	But we can do in circs.  There will be criticism.  But in line with report of Cttee. apptd. by late Govt.



O.L.	P. tax over a larger range.  



P.T. 	Yes : but no more tax will be collected.



R.A.B.	This is only method.  



P.T. 	shd. announce in speech in Budget debate.



P.M.	Risk of extendg. p. tax to new range of articles.  Needless pol. trouble.



P.T.	This memo. doesn’t touch p. tax side of ques.



W.	Utility mark has lost its works.  B/T. plan meets long-standing desire of trade.  Progressive plan.  Nothing to do with p. tax – wh. is a Budget matter.



H.C.	I support this plan.  



M-F.  	So do I.



R.A.B.	Keep the word “utility” – “British Standards Utility” scheme.



Sw.	Considered qua publicity.  Cab. have accepted Douglas report : that being so, this is essential.



		Agreed – to be expld in a speech, not a statement.





		8.	John Deere Project.



P.M.	J.S. memo is conclusive.



R.A.B.	Now said to be a dollar earner.  Establish that, at mtg. with B/T. and B/E. and then let them go forward.



P.M.	J.S. shd. attend to ensure success.  R.A.B. E.P.C. cd then decide.
