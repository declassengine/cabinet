C.C. 17(51)							13th December 1951



		1.	Tin and Steel Negotiations with U.S.	     [Enter Sw., L.B., D.S.



Sw.	Strong U.S. feeling about Malayan tin prices – reflected in Congress and shared by some members of Adminn.



	They must buy, w’in a month.

	Price is now v. low : if U.S. come into market it will rise and there will be a row with U.S. – affecting work of I.U.C. and P.M.’s visit.

	Hence plan tht. we shd. buy the tin and barter it for extra steel.

	In line with principle of reciprocal aid.  Price ques. wd. be concealed.

	At basis of £1.000 p. ton for tin and £40.000 for steel.  Average.

	Ivan Spens advised £950-£1.150 as price range over next year.  Any addl. price for steel must go on to consumer.  But if P.M. can get first 500.000 t. as free aid (not end item) that wd. bring out average paymt. p. ton well below world price level.

	U.S. tell us we can’t expect more than ½ m. t. w’out countervailing aid from us.

	Other risks   a)  Pressure tht. we shd. continue to control M. tin prices.

		         b) Precedent for future deals.

	Neither is serious.



I.	Want this opened before P.M. goes.



W.	Why cd. we buy tin cheaper than U.S. cd.



Sw.	Not assumg. that.  We shall have to pay average price – higher than now.

	We may lose dollars.  But if U.S. went into market and price rose v. them, Truman wd. ask Congress leave to use stock pile.



D.S.	Will industry lose by this?



Sw.	We shd. not agree price of steel.  Only schedule of types – at current prices.  Steel consumer bears any deficit.

	This is a barter deal.



D.S.	To reduce risk, cd. M/M. avoid driving tin prices up by using our stocks?



Sw.	Yes, if it rose excessively eg. above £1.150.



P.M.	Will this deal spoil my approach for free steel?



Sw.	You will ask for ½ m. as free aid.  U.S. advise we cdn’t hope for more w’out quid pro quo.  



P.M.  	Let me put it.  Don’t do it in advance.



R.A.B.	Complete jam on tin.  U.S. are holding off market.  U.S. welcome reciprocal deals.  This will start marketing of tin – and enable us to get more steel.  400.000 t. is all they will offer now.  On this you can get ½ m. on the deal : ½ m. free : and you can try for another ½ m.



P.M.	Open with a bargain and you won’t get the gift.



Ch.	OK. if we get deal settled before W’ton visit.



A.E.	Good to remove the soreness in U.S. over tin before our visit.



P.M.	Prefer to ask for steel, then offer tin as a gesture not as a deal.  Eg. Bases and destroyers.  Not enough time to distinguish one transaction from the other.



Ch.	Must keep them off the market m’while.



Sw.	Tip them off to do nothg. on tin before P.M. arrives.



R.A.B.	All the Americans say they want this.

	Knollys cd. sound it out before P.M. arrives.



P.M.	Not with the Americans.



W.	Buy 20.000 t. of tin now.  Price will rise.  Wd. give P.M. a new level of values.



P.M.	Tell U.S. don’t buy now : we’ll talk in Jan.  [We aren’t going to buy m’while.]  



L.B.	O.L. is in favour in principle of tin for steel deal.



H.C.	All U.S. opinion favour doing this.  Will they be disappointed if we haven’t done it now.



		Agreed : (no action save x/. at present.

			   (Knollys can give his own views m’while.





		2.	Leakages.



P.M.	Herald.  P.R.O. in Ty.?



R.A.B.	Also leak about waiver.



 

	3.	P.M.’s Broadcast.



P.M.	Announced as Party pol. b’cast.  Didn’t want it so.  Bad take off for visit to U.S.  Can I put it off until after Xmas.



R.A.B.	Needed - before Xmas.



P.M.	Wd. B.B.C. agree to call it a Ministerial b’cast.



Ch.Wh.	Wd. restrict you v. much.



A.E.	Country needs to be told state wh. we inherited.



R.A.B.	Must impart sense of crisis.



W.	Do it – whatever its called.





		4.	Labour Controls.



W.M.	Cttee have agreed tht. I shd. hold discussions.

	Tewson has said informally Unions won’t mind it.



		Agreed :  Consult Unions and B.E.C. in confidence and 			   N.J.A.C.I.
