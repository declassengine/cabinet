C.C. 9(52)							29th January 1952



		1.	Economic Situation.				[Enter B.H.



R.A.B.	Decn. to open Budget 4/3 – to be announced this pm. – will help to excuse other decns not going further than they do.



P.M.	Agree.  At present, it looks too much like raiding stock-pile.



R.A.B.	Good to state that.  Strategic and commercial stocks were high.



P.M.	Wheat and flour stocks.  Alarmed at that.  Is it safe?  Tizard’s memo. on mines.  U-Boats.  Danger at outset of war.

	C.O.S. independently have given same warning to Cabinet.

	Govt. wd. be exposed to v. damaging criticism if there were war.



R.A.B.	We discussed : decided unwise to let whole blow fall on wheat stocks.

	Resent plan : having wheat at 11½ : sugar at 11 : oil &amp; fats 22 wks.

	£4½ m.  £3 m.  £8½ m. savings respectively.

	To make up to £150 m.  M/F. will cut consumptn.  Polish bacon (9m) cheese (2m) and miscell. (7½ m) – coffee, milk Euro. free trade items (mainly canned meat).  This wd. be part on consumptn. and part on stocks.



P.M.	Wd. sooner take risk on sugar.



Ch.	War will start after harvest.  At that point our stocks wd. be higher – shd. tide us over.



P.M.	Leave wheat stocks as now and don’t compensate elsewhere.



R.A.B.	Stocks in 1952, after cuts, will be higher than 1951 end figures.



Ch.	You cd. make the cut in wheat stocks in June, when you know.



R.A.B.	Need for decision now is to stop the purchases.

	Must get the £150 m. savings on imports.  Because of lead to Doms etc., eg Havenga’s speech.



O.L.	Gold and dollar reserves have also strategic importance.



P.M.	Views of C.O.S. shd. not be set aside.



Ch.	Further cuts on fats eg. 22 to 20 wks.  And have wheat at 13.



W.	Or a bit more off sugar and fats instead of wheat.

	

	Agreed	.   (Cut stocks by £16 m. as proposed, but avoid redn. of

		    (wheat stocks in deference to views of C.S.

	R.A.B. repeating his view that ration cuts wd. have bn. a manlier course.  We shd. reserve right to cut rations.

	Agreed.  x/ later – and  “warn”(!) that this may come later.



R.A.B.  	I shall suggest to M/F. further reduction            	[Enter A.E.

	on canned meat from Europe.



	Agreed.  R.A.B. to announce today tht. he will open Budget on 4/3.



R.A.B.	C.O.S. view was based on assumptn. tht. oil and sugar were not to be cut.  But wheat involves more shipping.



R.A.B.	Bound to be redn. in supply of agric. machinery because of steel shortage.

	We shd. say so, today.  Farmers won’t like it.  But they are more mechanised than any other farmers.



P.T.	Every industry will be short of capital equipment.  Don’t single agric. out for special mention.  



A.E.  	“Industrial steel” wd. cover it.  Agreed.



P.T.	£22 m. cut in tobacco.  Wd. sooner it wasn’t mentioned.  No other commodity is to be quantified.  Cd. say “far larger than any others”.



A.E.	I shd. mention it.  



P.M.  	Must be mentioned.





		2.	Egypt.



A.E.	Diffy : suggested we shd. not be too forthcoming because shall invite rebuff from our Eg. Govt.  Draft approved, subject to amendmts. 

	Corresponding statement in Lords.





		3.	Washington and Ottawa Talks.



P.M.	Don’t want to make un-debatable statement tomorrow.  Wd. be jejune – farcical in avoiding challenge.  Ques. wd. follow.

	I wd. prefer not to make it.



	4 P.Q.’s today arising out of visit.  I wd. answer them together and invite House to await full statement to be made at opening of F.A. debate next week.



A.E.	You may get away with it.  But a) campaign v. you.  b) I have some P.Q.’s tomorrow which have a bearing on our talks.

	House is v. anxious to hear about it all.

B.H.	They mght try to get discn. on adjournment.



A.E.	We should then have to say – wait until next week.



		P.M.’s view accepted.

	x.  Later, message brought from Labour Whip askg. for statement today.



P.M.	Let’s see what fuss they make today.  If there’s great trouble, I will promise to make it tomorrow.



B.H.	Then you will have it forced out of you.  Is that good?



A.E.	Debunk their campaign v Korea at once – in reply to P.Q.



		Agreed:  {short statement on Wednesday.

			   {fuller    “      in F.A. debate next week.





		2.	Egypt (continued).



A.E.	Tel. 220. is the most important.  Eg. Parly. time-table.  No negotn. with this Govt.



P.M.	F.O. Tel. 209.  Para. 3.  …. no wish to m’tain B. troops indefinitely ….

	Is this so?



A.E.	Comes out of 4 Power Proposals.  This hasn’t bn. said yet.



P.M.	Wd. prefer to say “no desire to bear alone the internatl. burden of m’taining the waterway”.
