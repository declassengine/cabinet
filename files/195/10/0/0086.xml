	Announce re-assembly 14/10.



P.M.	Also new Session 4/11, if asked.  The way is clear.



H.C.	Better keep them guessing – helps to finish business in October.  Also

		more constitutional to delay announcement.  Wd sooner wait –

		Opposn are v. troublesome.

	will announce Steel W. Paper – publn Monday p.m.





	2.	Miss Ward’s motion re Members’ salaries – shall be asked.



P.M.	C.R.A. repd hardships of Labour members.  But I promised only

		considn.  Later, after spkg. to 1922 Cttee, I told him this was

		not the right moment.  He knows we won’t do it.  Told him

		he cd. when next in office.

	You can say no oppy for time for this motion.



Sal.	Repns fr. Labour Peers &amp; some of ours, who are in much worse case.

		No salary or allowance for expenses, save rlway. fares.

	No ques. of salary.  Only poss. wd. be relief fr. taxation for expenses

		other than fares.



P.M.	Cd be taken into a/c with reform of H/L. or with salaries of M.P.’s.



O.L.	Cd be adjusted by Revenue rules – no legn.



Sal.	Will say I will report their repns to C/Ex.



P.M.	This is not the time.





	3.	Council of State.



H.C.	Not urgently needed before recess?



Sal.	Leave over until eve of Austr. visit.



P.M.	Nice to let Queen Mother know it’s intended.





	



	4.	Meat Ration.



L.P.	Increase fr. 1/9 to 2/- to be announced on Friday.



				[Enter C.O.S.

	5.	Egypt.



S.Ll.	Read this a.m.’s telegram from Cairo.

	A.E. proposes to recall Amb. (on leave) to Cairo.

		x/ shd. be some acceleration of Rodeo, now at 96 hrs., to 24 hrs.



Al.	Situation needs watching.  But wd. not advise sending ships to Alex –

		mght. be thought to be going to rescue King.  Let them go to

		Port Said, as planned.



S.Ll.	A.E. – cd. we move troops to Erskine Line w’out provocn

		  against sending ships to Alex. at this moment.

		  Genl. N. &amp; P.M. shd. be warned of x/ for sole purpose of

		  saving B. lives.



Al.	Don’t favour 24 hrs’ – means loadg. troops into ships.  48 hrs’ is

		enough.

		Robertson shd. go back.

		No more of troops yet to Erskine Line.



P.M.	Gt. disadv. in appearg. to seek to take advantage of domestic diffies

		to increase our hold over E.  Dictator has ample force to check

		rioting &amp; he says he means to.  We shd. wait until real threat			to B. lives occurs.

	Certainly we shd. not be precipitate.

	No certainty tht. Army will facilitate Comm. revolution.  If the

		Comms. tried to take this chance, we mght. have chance to

		mobilise world opinion behind B. intervention.  But not now.

	Not going to fuss over Farouk.

	Period of ‘silent alert’.  No movemt. outside C. Zone.  Bring Rodeo

		to less than 96 hrs.



C.N.S.	At 48 hrs.’ notice ships now at Istanboul wd. have to cut visit

		short.  And those arriving at Malta wd. have to go back.

 

P.M.	Movement of ships wd. occasion as much alarm.  Don’t favour it, 

		until B. lives are in danger or Comm. resoln imminent.

	Wait – say at present no more than prepare to go to 48hrs.’ notice.



V.C.I.G.S.	O.K. for Cairo opn.  No improvemt. for Alex. unless we move the

		ships.



	Alex.		Go to 48 hrs.’ in Canal Zone.  Don’t move ships.



	C.N.S.	Wd mean they cd. move prob. at 72 hrs., not less.

	P.M.		No need therefore to take initiative in informg. N.  But, if

			he gets to know we are moving, he can be told we intend

		|	only to be ready to protect B. lives.  But if mil. can establ.

		|	contact with him easily, tell him.

	All this subject to A.E.’s covering approval.

				[Exit C.O.S. &amp; S.Ll.



	6.	Charges for Overseas Telegrams.



P.M.G.	Considered again with F.O. &amp; Ty.  Urgent because negotns with U.S.		await ratificn.  No paymt. of dollars to U.S:  merely stopping

		makg. them incur a loss wh. they have to make good by sending 

		dollars here.  They asked for 1/4½:  we offer only 1/=.  Can’t

		discriminate v U.S.A. by raisg. other rates &amp; not theirs.  We 

		carry only 20% of Atl. traffic.

	Co-opn by all cos. is essential to satisfy. World Service.  Must meet

		their views.

	F.O. were satisfied.

	Announcemt.  Preferred to do it before recess rather than wait until

		Parlt. has just gone away.



R.A.B.	Service wd. have ended if we had gone on forcing U.S. cos. to make

		good the deficit.



P.M.	Announce when you like.



Sw.	Can’t do it w’in days of adjournment.  Can it be held until Sept.



P.M.G.	Must tell Americans.  May then leak.

			Date of announcement:  end of next week.

			                                        in H/C. in reply to P.Q.



	7.	Economic Policy.



	Imports



R.A.B.	Decide to put these into effect at once.  £123 m.

	Will not announce in detail.

	But on exports I want to say somethg. on coal.



L.	No longer object:  sales are going well.



R.A.B.	Food:  shall not specify.  Will not disclose stock level.  Will say

		no reduction in consumptn levels of rationed food.

	Shd. now get through to end/52.  R.S.A. will not now be – 20:

		&amp; U.K. shd. be in balance.  Can strike a note of confidence –

		so long as we persevere in the measures agreed.  That is 

		necessary in order to steady financial nerves in N. York.



Ch.	Stocks, overall, is better than July ’52.

	Tho’ one or two (especially food) are down.



	Investment.



R.A.B.	If we did nothg., £100 m. more than ever before wd. be invested in

		bldg. – at expense of exports &amp; prod. industry.  This is an effort

		to mitigate that.  Decontrol is too dangerous:  drastic cuts are

		unacceptable:  I compromise on a 5% cut all round.  From angle

		of overseas opinion &amp; home opinion it wd. be wrong to seem to 

		let defence take the full knock.



H.M.	Trust p’mme won’t be publd.  May be a good domestic plan.  But

		publn wd. do no good:  wd. enable critics to take total money,

		divide by cost of house, &amp; deduce we have cut p’mme.  I have

		bn. careful to avoid announcg. a p’mme.  Don’t want to

		announce it now, or enable a cut to be deduced.

	On assumg. office we found p’mme of 200,000 houses.  Never 

		reached.  We shd. have built 85/90.000 in 1st 6 mos.  We have 

		built 110.000.  They were all Socialist houses.  We have bn.

		lucky with weather:  have broken bottlenecks.  We shall build

		120,000 in next 6 mos.  230.000 total:  30.000 over the ceiling.

		Largely because we set no depressing limit.

	We have footings for work of ’53.  Shall build 260.000 – save for

		physical (starving materials) or moral (discouraging industry)

		reasons.

	What is best method of handling this?  i) Numbers – aim at 260.000.

		Was 1st suggd we cut it to 230.000.  ii) Materials – suggd we

		limit use of imported materials.  don’t mind running down stocks

		because prices are falling.  Avoiding use of timber by boneless 

		house – and steel, by reducg. no. of flats &amp; insistg. on load-

		bearing walls or re-inforced concrete.  iii) Money.  Wtr. you

		put £416 or £395 into p’mme doesn’t matter.

	Pol. effect of announcg. curtailment of housg. effort.

	We can however consider what we do in ’54 – needn’t be fixed until

		Nov.

	However it be expressed, I want authy to build 230.000 in 1952 &amp;

		260.000 in 1953 and consider in Nov. what we shd. do in 1954.



P.M.	1953 is the critical year, in wh. Boneless houses get planned for 	bldg. in 1954.



H.M.	In ’54 we cd. build 300.000 with same timber as is now used for

		200.000.



P.M.	Carry it out durg. ’53 (i.e. pig it thro’) &amp; get thro’ to ’54 when we can

		build with less materials.

	Also, danger in rigidity. ………



R.A.B.	Must have startg. dates applied to housing e.g. in areas like Coventry.

		We cd. then slow down in those areas and put more houses into

		other areas.



H.M.	Can’t agree.  Suitable for small no. of big projects:  but not for large

		no. of small units (e.g. individual houses).

	Can agree tht. starting of housing schemes, as blocks are agreed with

		M/W.  But we have bn. doing this.  And M/W. is to-day in 

		Coventry to sort things out there.

	Avoid general rule:  accept consultn on black spots.



R.A.B.	I’m satisfied if D.E. is – so long as we curb ingenuity of housg. &amp; 

		prevent it fr. getting in ahead of prodve industry.



P.T.	5% cut on prod. industry carries egalitarianism too far.  Hope this

		won’t be pressed.  This means £10 m. less than ’50.

	What about schools?  Gets more steel than all B/T. allocn.



R.A.B.	Ready to discuss with P.T.



H.M.	Repeat objn to publn.  Genl. support for that view.



Sw.	Rely on allocations of materials e.g. steel.



R.A.B.	This is a ridiculous nuisance.  Only a rough guide to what we can

		afford.                 Agreed:  no publication.



Ch.	Agree tht. other p’mmes (e.g. education) shd. contribute to enable

		industry to have £100 m.



P.M.	Accept memo. in principle:  but allow margin of 

	e.g. £10 m. to meet special needs of B/T. etc.

	Ceiling shd. not be rigidly imposed.

	No discouragement to housing, until we reach boneless

		state of ’54.  No abandonment of intention to reach 

		260.000 houses in ’53.





	8.	Textiles from Czechoslovakia.



O.L.	Best deal in circs.  Better than it was.



Sim.	Good answer to any row.



S.Ll.	Comp. increases in other quotes will be defensible in O.E.E.C.?



P.T.	Watchg. that – will consult F.O.





	9.	Assistance for Building Fishing Vessels.		[Enter  T.D.



L.P.	As in brief.

R.A.B.	Lower interest imposs.  Shares not accepted.  Grants remain.

		Let me work out system of grants &amp; bring it back to

		Cabinet.  Next Tuesday.
