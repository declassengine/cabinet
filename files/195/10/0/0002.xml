R.A.B	2 Mtgs. of Cttee.

	M/Housing concerned - trying to help him on timber starting dates.

	More consultn. needed with Deptl Ministers concerned.  Tho’ much done betwn. offls. during Election.



J.S.	P.6.(c) Does this mean no increase in no. houses bldg. in ’52?



H.M.	At present rate, cd. complete (I hope) more than planned for ’52.

	by reducg. nos. started.  To increase means substitute materials and improvisation.  Softwood timber is trouble.

P.M.	Can’t begin by cutting timber.  Death to expansion of house p’mme.

	Stock-piling v. serious proposal.



R.A.B.	180 m. by end/52 – good progress – under present plans.

	Danger to economy outweighs risk to defence.



A.E.	I wd. go even slower because of high prices.



P.M.	Must take a/c of views of Defence Dpts.



R.A.B.	Food, tobacco, softwood and rubber mainly.  Not directly affectg. defence.  Discussed with officials in M/D.

L.  	1 m. tons wd. do – just : cost £8/9 m.  But must move rapidly.  Buy from U.S. – with U.S. shipping.  



P.M.  	Must provide for this.  Avoid minor irritants.



H.M.	Care in announcement.  May decide to do, but not announce.

	L.a. borrowing – will go to market rate.  Convinced they shd. not be able to borrow at less than Govt. can.  But effect wd. be to raise rents : v. awkward.  Prs. we can give compensatg. subsidy to avoid immediate rise in rents.



R.A.B.	They have raised money at 3%.  Shd. be 3¾% to 4%.

	Last year borrowed £280 m.  Can’t go on. £200 m. of this for housing.

R.A.B.	Major cuts involve changes of policy.  Must discuss.  Shan’t therefore announce specific cuts.   E.g. 15.000 off c. Service.   



P.M. 	No.  Don’t say that in advance.  Wd. create alarm.  We might do more.

		Aim at 50/60 economy in Govt. expenditure.  Look into points made in 		Election eg. stationery.  But don’t announce in advance.



Ch.		Defer announcement of details.  But make it clear it’s coming – and 		relate it to Socialism.



R.A.B.		Want to circulate my formula.  



P.M. 		To me also (? first).



P.M.		Increase in F. Service.

W.		£54 m. canned meat etc. Planned to reduce to £27 m.

		Wd. prefer to meet Ty. needs in other ways.



R.A.B.		We can keep faith with “liberalisation” even if we go so far as this.

		The canned meats etc. are v. expensive.



W.		But workers are buying them.



R.A.B.		I cd. review this with W., H.G. and others – on method w’in the total.
