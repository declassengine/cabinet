C.C. 35(52)							1st April 1952



		1.	Farm Price Review.		           [Enter Sw., Ll.G. and T.D.



L.P.	Discussions have not gone well.  Farmers have rejected offers made.

	Farmers want increases on milk and eggs, on wh. they get quick money.

	We want more on meat.



T.D.	We have offered £46½ : farmers come down to £61.  Can’t close this gap at 50.

	Farmers fear they can’t increase prodn. w’out further recoupment.

	Won’t ask for more money.  But a break wd. be serious because cdn’t get drive for efficiency w’out their co-opn.  They are depressed by continued rise in costs.



Ll.G.	Excessive recoupment on milk (200%) and eggs (150%) as cpd. with pigs (only 70%).

	We must not encourage milk and eggs at expense of meat.



R.A.B.	£61 m. means defendg. over recoupmt. of costs.  Wd. be worse than break because public opinion cd. not be carried.

	Propose L.P. and I. shd. see leaders to try to make them see sense.

	Only other variant : suspend increase in cost of animal feed – wd. take £14 m. off farmers’ figure and wd. help smaller men.



A.E.	Wdn’t help to close the gap.  



T.D. 	But wd. assist in presentation.



J.S.	Don’t do it save to secure agreement.



O.L.	Paper pounds can be tolerated if they help b/payments.  Mistake to offend farmers for £5 m. or so of paper.



L.P.	We have already given them £10 m.



T.D.	I cd. prob. settle at £55 m.



P.M.	They have to borrow.  



R.A.B. 	But Banks have agreed tht. agric. shall not be squeezed.  



P.M. 	But they pay the 4%.  



T.D. 	And it isn’t taken into a/c in the £47½ m.



P.M.	? £54 m.  



Sw. 	Can it be done w’out reflection on food prices.

	a)  Milk means meat.  Must get it thro’ small diary herds.

	b)  Fertiliser plan, wh. avoids increasg. food prices.



L.P.	Shd. be no further increase in food prices.

	Cd. be done as by line subsidy.



R.A.B.	We cd. make fertiliser subsidy a direct Govt. grant., via food subsidy.

	It’s not correct to do so because fertilisers improve crop not capital value of land.  



Sw. 	Direct incentive to productivity.



R.A.B.	Means defendg. great increase in farmers’ income.  Diff. unless we put it on b/paymts. grounds.

	If we did this on fertilisers, we cd. not agree to over-recoupmt. on milk.



		R.A.B. and L.P. to see farmers’ leaders tomorrow, with Agric

                 x/		Ministers and have a show. down.  Settle it then.



R.A.B.	Tell them no further recoupmt. on milk and eggs.

	Offer the animal food concession.

	Suggest fertiliser direct grant.



P.M.	{x/ tomorrow.

	{Cab. take final decision Thursday.

	{Debate Friday.

							[Exit Ll.G. and T.D.



		2.	Parliament.					[Enter H.M.



H.C.		Opposn. have tabled 59 new clauses on Army Bill.  Declaration of 			procedural war.



P.M.	We can threaten to resort, if necessary, to guillotine.



H.C.	This Bill must be obtained because of time limit – annual Bill.



P.M.	H.C. shd. study precedents on guillotine procedure : in preparation for Steel Bill eg.





		3.	Tangier.



A.E.	Sent tel. saying most reluctant to agree to any troops going fr. Gib to Tangier and none shd. go w’out refce. to Ldn.

A.E.	As in memo.

	£4 - 4½ m. may fail – U.S. may say it’s not enough. £10 m. last year.

	Hope to get more back fr. Y. eg. in maize : we ought to attach strings to any further loan.



R.A.B.	Grateful to A.E. : hope he can settle on this figure.



		Memo. : approved.



A.E.	Will come back to Cab. before there is a break down.





		7.	European Defence Community.



Al.	C.O.S. are considering this today.

	[We have 4½ Divns.		aircraft.	120.000 ration strength

	 U.S.   “    6   Divns.		aircraft.	290.000 ration strength.]





		8.	Admission of Foreign Communists to U.K.



M-F.	Refuse admn. to people who want to come to anybody concerned with World Peace Council.  But, subject to individual objn., want to admit fraternal delegates to T.U., Student Congresses or other B. institutions.

	Paras 5 - 6.  Disposed to admit to conferences of B. Comm. Party – a legitimate pol. Party and not likely to deceive re its aims.



P.M.	So called “World Peace Movement”.



H.C.	Suppose B.C.P. organised World Comm. Mtg.



M-F.	Mght come under para. 1 as bogus.  Wd. cease to be a B. affair and as international wd. be “boycotted.”  Must have discretion.



A.E.	I support these principles.  Leave it to H.O. and F.O. to forestall any excessive attendance of foreigners to B.C.P. mtgs.

L.P.S.	What is posn. of B.C.P. – is it a legit pol. Party.



A.E.	H.O. and I can concert what we do.



P.M.	“tolerated” vice “recognised” pol. Party.





		9.	Atomic Energy – Security.



M-F.	D. Mirror and D. Express scare re atomic pp. found in H’stead.

	This is 1/4 hoax.

	U.S. Press have it as B. breach of security.

	Best to have a P.N. Ques by me and handle it as a hoax.





		10.	Egypt.



A.E.	C.98 is for informn.

	i)  E. elections p’poned.  ii) On defence side, E. have come some way to meet us, eg. technicians and air.  iii) Even on Sudan they have made some move.

	Amb. has asked leave to return for consultn.  I’ve told him he can if he sees sign of progress.

	They have yielded – they do want a settlement.



L.	Shipping interests concerned to know tht. some protectn. will remain for them.



A.E.	Suez Canal Convn. comes up for separate revision in a few years.

	Will help if a more friendly Govt. can be establd. in Egypt.



Al.	Para. 1. at end of first sub paragraph : subsistg …. Add “satisfactory to both parties.”



	Para. 2.  No reference to our Base.  Must say E. are prepd. to play their part.  Leaves too much to their discretion.  They shd. be pinned down more definitely to Egypt via “M/East.”  Proposed addl.



P.M.	Other Powers shd. be pressed to accept responsibilities in E. on basis tht. we shan’t stay indefinitely.  Press for token forces, esp. fr. U.S. and France.

A.E.	Ready to omit “thus”.  



Al. 	Or substitute “also”.  Agreed : Omit “thus”.



A.E.	No agreement with any E. Govt. on basis of adding Fr. or Turkish troops in Egypt.



Al.	Must have striking force w’in distance of Base.  Gaza wd. cost £100 m. over 10 years.

L.	Why shdn’t maritime Powers of world share in that cost.



P.M.	We shd. not w’draw until we have secured 5 Power guarantee of this Canal.

	Para. 2. (designed as putting our aims on record) is the worst of the lot.



A.E.	Para.2. = 4 Power proposals.  We supported them at Genl. Election.  Are we to go back on it now?

	If you think there’s no security without B. land forces in E., I must stop negotiations.



P.M.  	Let us continue our discussion on Thursday.



H.C.	Is there anything new in this memo?



A.E.	No.



Al.	Para. 2. is distasteful.  Can’t we omit it?



A.E.	It benefits us because it draws them into M/E. defence, wh. they have h’to refused to do.



R.A.B.	E. Govt. and Bank are in bad way : want to avoid atmosph. of disagreemt.

	Shall have to raise on Thursday ques. of balances.  They are right out of funds.

	Remember Lancs. situation.
