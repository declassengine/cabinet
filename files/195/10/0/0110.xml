	1.	Kenya.	[Enter  Sw. &amp; B-H.	                                                      



P.M.	O.L. and M/D. shd. look into ques. of use of a) tear gas  b) short

		guns with buckshot.  And submit report to Cabinet.





	2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.  Wednesday:  3 choices.

	A.E. doesn’t want C/Europe.



M.F.	Prefer Welsh debate to be p’poned for a week because

	Socialist objn to Lloyd’s apptmt.



B.H.	The Opposn threaten vote of censure – cd. take this out

	on Welsh debate.

	

P.M.	Let H.C. settle this with Ministers concerned.





	3.	Purchase Tax.



R.A.B.	Will yield £4-5 m. p.a.  Said on Finance Bill we wd. do it.  Am losing

		elsewhere on P. Tax.  Must get it thro’ before Xmas.  Essential

		part of D. scheme.  Much furniture will be below D.  Wd be

		operative from date of Order, not of debate.

	Yield of p. tax = £300 m. p.a. equivalent of 2/= on income tax.

	May I discuss with H.C. means of getting it thro’ before Xmas.

		M’while I will give P.M. description of tax &amp; how it doesn’t fall

		on cottagers.

					[Exit  B-H.

					[Enter  Att.G.

	4.	Judges Salaries.



Sim.	Cab. method of relieving part of salary from tax wd. have brought

		greater benefit to Judges with private incomes.  Hence

		alternative of £1.000 allowance in addn to salary.  Simpler

		method.

	Specific exclusion of Ld. Chancellor.  If this is done,  at present tax 

		levels his net will be £3.538 wh. is less than what Judges, L.C.J.

		and M/Rolls will get.  Cab. may not think this right.  A man may

		prefer to go for L.C.J. vice Ld. Chanc.



P.M.	Include Ld. Chancellor.  Any individual cd. renounce it if he pleased.



R.A.B.	A future Ld. Ch. shd. be included.  Only present ques. is tht. his Cab.

		colleagues have accepted salary reduction.



P.M. 	[or I] shd. discuss with Opposn before introduction of Bill.



			Agreed.



Sim.	Delete refce to Ld. Ch. &amp; allow me to discuss with P.M. my own 

		personal posn.



R.A.B.	Warning that this Bill will provoke request for increase in M.P.’s

		salaries.



			Approved Bill for early introduction.





	5.	Justices’ Clerks:  Compensation.



M-F.	Scheme won’t be put into operation unless compensn is paid.  Tories

		in H/L. are commd deeply to this reform, incldg. the compensn.

		The Bill passed H/L. on understandg. tht. compensation wd.

		be paid.



R.A.B.	Danger of repercussions.  No explicit pledge.



Sim.	But clearly understood assumptn betwn. the Parties.



Sim.	7 of the Acts affected specifically say no compensation.



H.M.	There will be pressure:  but we cd. resist it.  This is different.



R.A.B.	Rising cost of whole scheme.



M-F.	Separate point.  And we shan’t get effective return for money spent

		unless we do this compensn &amp; get reform moving.



P.M.	P’pone decision.  Sim. may tell Mertheyr tht. decn hasn’t bn. taken

		against.





	6.	Married Quarters for U.S. Forces.     [Exit  Att.G.

			                                                  [Enter  D.E., Att.G. &amp; de L. 



R.A.B.	Accept in principle and let Ty. &amp; Air Miny consult on siting.

		It’s a good dollar bet.  But I admit need for further thought on

		siting.



H.M.	Not an easy problem.  Several Dpts. are concerned.  Coogan’s 

		ineptitude has stirred up much ill-feeling.  Must avoid suggn tht.

		this will impede our housing programme.  And, where poss.,

		tht. we shall get a lasting benefit out of it.



de L.	Concerned about grumbling of Br. people at U.S. Air Force, with 

		their higher standards.  We shd. not appear to be cosseting them.

		Examine all other alternatives before we make new bldgs.

		for them.



R.A.B.	As much ill-feeling v. their bagging existg. accommn.



H.M.	Each site must be considered on merits.



de L.	1.000-1.500 cd. go w’in perimeter of airfields occupied by U.S.

	Thereafter, go for derelict sites wh. already have services laid on.



P.M.             *	Active agency shd. be created to breed good relations with U.S.

		Forces.



de L.	Being done already.



P.M.	Let’s have a report on it.

			

			Cttee of officials of Dpts. concerned (Air Miny in lead)

			to go into details.		[Exit  D.E.

					[Enter  P.M.G.

					[Exit  H.C.

	7.	Television Development.



R.A.B.	Television is takg. resources needed for export etc.  Want to hold back

		developmt.  I of W., Aberdeen &amp; Plymouth shd. be delayed.



J.S.	If we did those, we cd. hold further development.

	Aberdeen is v. awkward because private co. say they have equipmt.

		to do it.



P.M.G.	B.B.C. cd. do it cheaper &amp; better.  Ques. is one of use of resources.

		It’s for Cab. to decide that.

	Tempy scheme wd. cost £55.000:  Aberdeen &amp; 7 mile radius.  The

		other scheme wd. cost less e.g. £40.000.  Awkward therefore to		serve smaller popn in Aberdeen at higher cost.  The 3 areas wd.

		cost £200.000 by time we finished.



Ch.	Purchase of sets wd. involve larger use of resources.



P.M.G.	You cd. limit total supply.

	We shall have succession of agitations from area after area.

	84% E.  80% Sc. &amp; Wales  40% N.I. can now receive television.



P.M.	Look at this again in 6 months.		[Exit  R.A.B.



P.M.G.	I agree:  but I warn you there will be a row.  We must

			stand up v. it.



		P’pone announcemt. until end of this week.

	8.	Post Office:  Employment of Coloured Workers.



P.M.	Let us have a report on this.  Is there an increase?	[Exit  P.M.G.





	9.	Z. Reservists.



A.H.	Agreed with M/D. to do no Z. training in ’53.  We have trained a lot.

		T.A. is filling up.  We wd. need only 18.000.  Not justified in

		prolonging it for another year.  Won’t prevent us fr. doing it, if

		we wish, in 1954 – or, of course, in event of war or threat of war.



Al.	Saves £600.000.  R.A.F. aren’t doing it.  No need for it this year.





	10.	Korea:  Accreditation of War Correspondent of Daily Mirror.



A.H.	D. Mirror corresp. for Korea has bn. turned down by M.I.5.  Editor

		wants to know reason.  He is person of Commt associations.

		Will be trouble with Press if I don’t give the reason.  No corresp.

		has previously bn. turned down.

	M.I.5. sources wd. not be compromised by this disclosure.

			

			Agreed:  reasons may be given to Editor.

					[Exit  A.H., de L.



	11.	Nunn May.



P.M.	Will cause outcry in U.S.



M-F.	Entitled to the remission.  Breach of faith.  Hasn’t bn. done for 40 yrs.

		We cd. face that if safety of State required it.  Effect on him must 

		therefore be considered.  M.I.5. think tht. at present he is

		repentant;  &amp; if helped to earn his living is unlikely to go sour &amp;

		behave badly.



P.M.	Wd any decent person employ him?



M-F.	We shd. try to find him a job.



P.M.	He won’t get a job.  Govt. shd. certainly not employ him.  Will you

		let him go abroad?  He will be invited to Russia.



M-F.	M.I.5. don’t think so.

	We shd. be said to have done this at U.S. bidding or to placate them

		&amp; that wd. damage Anglo-U.S. relations.



Ch.	He hasn’t much value.  He is out of date.  Wdn’t be much use to 

		anyone.  But wd. make Anglo-U.S. co-opn more diff. if he went

		to Russia.

M-F.	Only over-riding security considns cd. justify what is a mean and

		discreditable act to the man.



Ch.	Only point is tht. he shdn’t go abroad.



M-F.	Cd be made condition of his licence tht. he doesn’t go abroad.  That

		wd. cover it until end of sentence.  Tho’ I cdn’t be certain of 

		enforcing it.



W.M.	Judge intended sentence with remission.  He shd. come out, unless 

		he is potentially v. dangerous.  Apparently he is not.  U.S.

		re-actions:  cd. be met by special conditions of licence.



			Agreed:  M-F. to examine special conditions of licence.
