C.C. 22(52)							27th February 1952



		1.	Foreign Affairs Debate.  Disclosure of Cab. Papers.

									[Enter B.H.

P.M.	I quoted from F.O. telegrams, not Cab. pp.

	I can’t be forced to lay them because not textual quotations.  Though I would like to do so.  Those of Sept. cdn’t be layed because of operations.  The May ones cd. if paraphrased (for cipher).



H.M.	May be better to leave A.B. in uncertainty : he doesn’t know what’s in those telegrams.





		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business in H/C.

	Defence Debate.  Approve or take note.  Agreed “Approve W. Paper”.

	not “the policy set forth in W. Paper”.





		3.	Prayer Book.



P.M.	Plan wh. I mentioned to Queen was D. of Cornwall, not Rothesay.

	Surely England can have one name – Edinb. and P. of Wales

	Now I’m told both names cd. be mentioned – Cornwall and R.  I see no objn. to that.



Sal.	Prefer D/Cornwall only.  Scots shd. be satisfied with D/Edin.



J.S.	Cd. the Scots pray for him as R.



W.	This concerns the Churches.  Cantuar wants D/C.  Moderator, who was consulted, raised no objn. to D/C.  It’s Lyon that has raised all this.  



CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000





C/E. pressing for decn. wd. like it taken by Pr. C. tomorrow.



H.C.       x/	Cd. he be prayed for as Prince Charles only – until he is P. of Wales.

		

		Agreed :  L.P. to persuade Cantuar and Queen of x/.





		4.	Family Name of Royal House.



Sim.	Draft Proclamation.  Follows that of 1917.



H.C.	“Of these Realms”?  



Sim.  	Follows 1917.  



H.C.  	Not “Queen of these Realms”.  

Sim.  	Cd. omit these words whenever they follow “Queen”.  



L.P.S. 	If you say “subject of these Realms”, you must say “Queen of these Realms”.



		Agreed :  Ld. Ch., L.P., Sal. and H.C. to consider this point 		   	   and report to P.M.





		5.	B.B.C. Monopoly.			[Enter S.Ll. and P.M.G.



L.P.S.		V. awkward pol. sitn.  But purely a H/C. agitation.  V. like the 		movement in H/C. for abolition of cap. pun. – a horrid warning.

		Press wd. be hostile because of self interest.

	The alternative plan has v. wide implicns. – frequencies.  Service use, politics, morals – all in hands of 5 men.



	Balance in favour of status quo pro tem.  Re-consider later.

	Opinion in Party is hardening in wrong direction – hence urgency.



W.	Volume of opinion in H/C. is large.

	Those who expect other licences are beginning to nibble at B.B.C. staff with offers of higher pay.



P.M.	L.P.S. shd. talk to H/C. group.  I’m content with status quo : but don’t want a row.  We must at least try to carry our Party.



L.P.S.	I have explained my personal views – w’out effect.

	1922 Cttee. will discuss next week.  I’m attending.  Shall I speak – personal views or Govts. views.



P.M.G.	Gammans favours sponsored p’mmes!  Tho’ he is behaving v. well.



Sel.Ll.	I was author of minority rept. on Bev. Rpt. favouring sponsoring.

	There is a poss. compromise.  Monopoly is dangerous : ques. is how to stop it.  Separate body to develop local b’casting : cd. move only slowly because of lack of resources.  Wd. be corrective to monopoly.



P.M.G.	Endorse L.P.S. on principle at stake.

	Practical considns. : nothg. at all can be done to start alternative p’mmes for some years because it involves erection of new stations on V.H.F.  When V.H.F. comes in, it’s assumed they can be let to competers – may not be so.  Forces Police and Fire may merge big inroads into them.  And we mght have to wait for ultra V.H.F.

	Cd. we not evade issue pro. tem on basis tht. there aren’t resources to 

         x/	do this for 5 years.  Base our policy pro tem on limitations of materials. M’while preserve right of P.M.G. to licence alternative monopoly.



								[Enter M-F.



W.	I took that line in H/L. debate before election because I knew of division of view in Party.

	Diffy. is that we have to give a 10 year Charter.

	Don’t delay.  Now you may be able to divide H/L. group – it contains some who are interested and others who speak on principle.  Latter can be answered by x/. above.



B.H.	Majority probably v. neutral of monopoly in our Party.

	But the 80/2 mtg. consisted of enthusiasm.  Majority overall wd. not be so large as that.  Some hostile votes or abstentions wd. be inevitable.

	Free vote wdn’t be popular with our side.  For Opposn. wd. vote the monopoly in.



O.L.	Must Charter be 10 years.  Make it 5, wh. relates it to period of impracticability.



L.P.S.	Politically that wd. be good.  But agitn usually begins about 3 yrs before end of any Charter.  5 yr Charter wd. give B.B.C. only 2 yrs. of peace.  But if 5 yrs. wd. get us out of our political diffy. we might have to do it.



J.S.	Repeated x/.  Monopoly doesn’t rest on Charter.



W.M.	7 years; as compromise.



L.P.S.	Tory back benchers are hearing only one point of view.

	How can they hear the other, w’out its appearing to be a Govt. view.

	Cd. I express a personal view – yielding my Chairmanship of the Cttee. to W.



W.	Can’t we handle Party on practical basis.  No resources for 5 yrs.

	Clear in Charter tht. no permanent monopoly is created.



S.Ll.	Leaves B.B.C. in control of all techn. developmt.  And they hold back V.H.F.  



P.M.G.  	Not true : Govts. have held them back.



P.M.	Can’t afford trouble in H/C. (with majority of 15) over issue like this.

	Let L.P.S. address 1922 Cttee.  Let W. go too.



L.P.S.	As representg. myself or the Govt.?



P.M.	You cd. say you spoke of Ch. of Cab. Cttee and wanted to hear their views before executive decision taken by Cabinet.



W.	Shall I speak to some of them as Chairman of Party.



L.P.S.	Support that.

	Let me and W. first listen to 1922 Cttee.  After, let W. spk. to them as Chairman – some of them.  Must be pretty quick – if Charter is to go thro’ before end of 6 months’ limit.  Let W. put across the fear tht. sponsored p’mmes wd. let Comm. Party on to the air.



L.P.S.	Suggest 1922 Cttee. take this ques. this week rather than next.

	Instead of Govt. publicity, wh. they are due to discuss tomorrow.



		(After discussion : let L.P.S. and W. attend and speak to

         Agreed		( 1922 Cttee on Thursday 28/2



					       [Exit P.M.G. and S.Lloyd and B-H.

					       [Enter D.S.

		6.	Security Procedure.



M-F.	As in memo.  Put all the detailed points.



R.A.B.	Endorse these proposals.  Shall have some trouble with T.U.’s, but we must wear them down.



			Approved.



R.A.B.	Who answers in H/C. v Commn. in C. Service.



W.M.	Ty. are employers.  Fin. Secy. shd. answer.



P.M.	Home Secy. can answer on genl. policy.  Fin. Secy. on emplt. aspect.



R.A.B.	P.Q.’s to be put down to Fin. Secy.  Home Secy. cd. assist if big ques. of policy arise.



P.M.	Draft me a statement on this if requd. on H/C.  PQ. procedure.



D.S.	What is Ministerial responsibility.



M-F.	To Minister of Dpt.  And he answers P.Q.s.
