C.C. 53(52)							15th May 1952



		1.	Parliament.				[Enter Sw. and B-H.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Wed. Transport Policy.  Motion – invite approval of policy in W. Paper.



P.M.	H/C. re-actions?  



B.H. 	Not v. enthusiastic.  



M-F. 	Chairman of   Agreed.

	Road Haul. Assocn. gave warm welcome at luncheon speech.



P.M.	Govt. spokesmen : M/T. open – P.M. may reply.  



A.E. 	Yes : want a bigger reply than Parly. Secy.  Hasn’t gone v. well in the country.



Sw.	In H/L. Lucas may not make the decln. tht. Labour will  re-nationalise.





		2.	Civil List.



R.A.B.	Have seen Opposn.  They weren’t v. helpful.  Suggd. contingencies fund shd. be in trust (P.M. Chanc + Keeper of Privy Purse) and E.E.B. wd. certify any deficit before it was drawn upon.  I have accepted this.



	Motion will be brght in on Mon. – for Select Cttee.

	Have offset Ch/Duchy Cornwall revenues v. Contingencies, on lines suggd. by H.C.

	They had a nibble at Duch/Lanc. revenues; but I resisted that.





		3.	Excess Profits Levy.



R.A.B.	Am tabling amendmts. tonight.  Won’t discharge new plan.

	But will give full story on Tues. pm. in speech; and then table the remaining amendments.



							[Enter D.S., and A.L-B.

		4.	Legislative Programme.



H.C.	As in memo. Want new Session to open on 3/2 because short period before Supply business.  Shall have trouble in finding time for legn. next session.



P.M.	Welcome this plan.  A guide, not a rule.  Must see how we go.

	Review in 3 months.

H.C.	Short time betwn. Cttee and Rpt. will cause trouble in both Houses, and also to Ministers i/c Bill.



A.L.B.	26 days were allowed in H/C. on Labour’s Transport Bill.  That comparison will be case in our teeth.



P.M.	Fr. Legn. Cttee for 1953.    Approved.





		5.	Steel Bill.



D.S.	We can’t be silent about our plans.  If we are to p’pone until ’53, new Bd. cdn’t operate until Jan. ’54.  Shall have to try to set up similar machinery on a voluntary basis.  Also prelimy. negotns. on sale of some of the more readily saleable units – eg. Vickers have ear-marked capital for that and can’t hang on to it for long w’out knowledge.  Must therefore publish plans before summer Recess.  Either 2nd Rdg. of Bill.  or W. Paper and a 1 day debate on it; and then publish the Bill.



P.M.	I favour 2nd course.  



M-F. 	So do I.  



H.C. 	And I.  Must find a day.



P.M.	Publn. of Bill would show we haven’t bn. idle; and only Parly. time table prevents us going on.



Sw.	Put detail in W. Paper and hold back text of Bill.



		Agreed:	Detailed W. Paper in June.

				1 day debate in H/C. after 2/3 wks.

				Announce then no time to legislate before

				next Session, but m’while adminve. action in

				anticipn.

							[Exit A.L.B.

	6.	



CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000





		7.	Council of Europe.



A.E.	May come up.

	This doesn’t fit well with N.A.T.O. into which we are more anxious to bring Doms.

	Also involves amalgamatg.  St. area in Europe.



O.L.	Hard enough to Comm.  Won’t work unless fiscal policies of members is centrally controlled.  If imposs. in Comm., hopeless in Europe.



Sal.	V. much concerned.  Arguments in Annex B. are conclusive of paras. 3(2) and (3) and (5), all of which is true.

	Boothby really aims at includg. U.K. into a federal Europe, wh. wd. break up the Comm.



P.M.	Needn’t go so far.  Why shdn’t we associate Comm. countries with C/Europe; in a general way.



Sal.	We are not members of Europ. community, but of an Atl. Comm.

	Even if we refer it back to Assembly, it may raise false hopes.

	Wd. prefer to say at once we can’t accept it or ask Doms. to envisage it. Take a firm line now.



P.T.	Agree with A.E.’s concln.  But don’t let us tie ourselves in advance to particular line of comm. policy.  Many arguments in Annex B. have no reference to Annex A.  I have submd. a memo. on Comm. Policy and we shd. take our line, then consult Comm.



M-F.	Endorse paras 6 and 7.  But agree with P.T.  I don’t accept reasoning in para. 3 of Annex B.  Don’t quite accept Sal’s view.  St Laurent, Menzies and Evatt and Holland all support Eur. greater unity and our leadership in that.

	Embrace conclns. but can’t accept arguments in para. 3.  Pol. fedn. isn’t inevitable : sterling convertibility is not relevant.



P.M.	We shd. be with not in any Federal system in Europe.

	But Eur. unity has won gt. sympathy in Doms.  They wd. like some contact with it.  Not imposs. for them too to be with not in.



A.E.	But do we now still prefer Atlantic Community.



P.M.	Assocn. with Assembly (not Cttee) isn’t objectionable.



O.L.	But this plan is concerned with economic and financial co-opn.



P.M.	Not in favour of that – only friendly interest in it by Doms.

	Don’t encourage rivalry or rigid separation betwn. N.A.T.O. and C/Europe.

	Agree Comm. is No. 1. circle : but there are others wh. we can belong to and support.



Sal.	Comm. lookg. twds. U.S. already : that may be intensified if we try to force them into closer assocn. with Europe.  Mght also weaken our ties with Comm.



P.T.	Gap betw. sterling and dollar world.  Can’t rule out assocn. of some kind betwn. sterling and non sterling/non dollar world.



D.S.	i)   All U.K. parties at Strasb. have opposed U.K. entry into any fedn.

	ii)  Stressed our Comm. connn.

	iii) This sort of plan is designed to find another way of ensurg. our closer association.  V. vague idea.  Unwise to suggest (as in para. 6(c) ) reference back; for Assembly can put no precision on this.  Wd. prefer to keep it in Cttee of Ministers.  Certainly no Eur/Comm. Confn – wh. wd. not be inter-Govt. but quite irresponsible.  But much of this comes out of desire to help us, and unwise therefore to turn it down.  Why not ask other Eur. Govts. to formulate their ideas more precisely and then U.K.



A.E.	Cttee may say “not our idea, we have nothg. to say”.  



D.S. 	Then they shd. reject it.  No advantage in getting Assembly to look at it again.



H.M.	Don’t send it back to Assembly.  Stall it off as stale.



Sal.	Even that amount of acceptance wd. be wrong.  Don’t draw Doms. into C/Eur.  Only contact shd. be thro’ U.K.  Must record my dissent.  Fear disintegrating effects on Comm.



		Agreed :	Get it p’poned w’out refce. back to	

				Assembly.  Point out diffies.	

				“Civilly disengage”.

								[Exit D.S.

								[Enter A.H., de L.

		8.	Germany : Defence Contribution.



A.H.	We have made economies.  U.S. have not.  Easier for them to make economies now.  Fr. expre. also has gone up by 100% since ’49.

	Our forces have gone up and our expenditure down.



P.M.	Our past virtues shd. be stressed.



R.A.B.	Support A.E.



de L.	R.A.F.  20 to 28 squadrons by July ’53.  Diff. to secure an absolute economy in context of expansion of our Forces.



A.E.	In last resort we shd. have to pay ourselves.

	This new Allied plan is more favourable to us.

		1) Memo. approved.  2) M/D. to submit memo. on

		bldg. (War and Air Miny.)

							[Exit A.H. de L.

 

	9.	Yugoslavia : Economic Aid.



A.E.	Fairly satisfy. for us.

	Cab. shd. note tht. the 3 Govts. propose to lecture them at same time on their investment p’mme.  As Tito is angry with us now, I am trying to p’pone for a bit eg. June.  Want to give this warning because want next year to reduce our contribn.



Ch.	Para. 8(1).  Will this cost much?



A.E.	There are some to be paid to us – we forego repaymt. instead of giving new money.





		10.	Cotton Imports.



Sw.	Thght. it wd. have to be settled by Monday.

	But now have secured a week’s delay.

	Will now have it up at E.P.C.





		11.	Meat.



P.M.	60% of pre-war here.  France – large increase.  Germany – small increase.  We are suffering to an extent much greater than any of those whom we beat or rescued in the war.

	Am circulating a memo. on this.





		12.	Emergency Powers.



P.M.	Right of entry w’out warrant.  Contrary to Tory policy.

	Sack the snoopers and limit powers of those who remain.



M.F.	Progress of enquiry with D.R. etc.
