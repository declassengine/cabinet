C.C. 76(52).				7th August, 1952.



	1.	Persia.			[Enter  Sw.



A.E.	Two main aspects.

                  	i)	No hope unless mil. coup d’état.  U.S. share that view.  W’in last

		few hrs. a more encouraging message from Tehran.  

		Genl. Zahidi has approached Embassy &amp; said 3 or 4 

		Nat. Front people have come to him expressing dissatisfn 

		with M.  Z. is also in touch with previous Opposition.  He has

		some support in Army.  He is therefore a possible.

	Told Middleton not to tell U.S. that Z. has come to us.  He will make

		an independent approach to them.  They may be interested.

                  	ii)	U.S. anxiety to give money to M.  Most inopportune because of 		(i).

		As soon as poss. we must discuss terms of a poss. agreemt. in

		order to delay any offer of U.S. cash.  Para. 19 therefore stands,

		tho’ mainly as a delaying tactic.  And add to (d) tht. we shd. 

		deprecate any U.S. cash to M. until a move is made.



R.A.B.	I agree with para. 19 of memo.

			

			Approved.



A.E.	Tydings anxious to have a go.  Getting hurt because I won’t say wtr.

		I want him to try.  I shall stall him off:  e.g. by asking what he

		thinks he cd. get.





	2.	Marshall Scholarships.



P.M.	Cd there be a limit on nos. of married men?



A.E.	Cd try to secure tht. majority will be under 25.

	Drop limit to 28:  &amp; express wish that majority shd. be under 25.



H.C.	Wives are a real nuisance.

	Express a preference for single men.



A.E.	Not so easy.



L.P.	$100 per mtg. is too much for Selection Cttee.



A.E.	Will look into that.

			

			Approved – subject to A.E.’s considn of points raised.



A.E.	They shd. be under 25 &amp; preferably unmarried – but no absolute bar.





	3.	Japanese Assets.



A.E.	Promise of late Govt.  But many members pledged the other way.



Al.	I favoured vol. organns method:  but they and Service Ministers prefer

		the per capita basis and be done with it.



P.M.	Object of belligerency is to avoid capture.



A.E.	Keep it to Jap. captives and give them somethg. worth while.



Al.	Vol. organns can’t do it on means test basis.  They wd. take it into

		their general pool.



R.A.B.	i)	B/T. announcemt. &amp; Nuttings. – volte face.

	ii)	Will excite claims.

	iii)	What agency will handle this?

	Prefer to adhere to earlier decision.  If not, must tell H/C.



P.T.	Must announce a change of policy.



A.E.	F/E. P.o.W. want this – a few votes in it.



P.M.	Why not give it to vol. organisations, but don’t require them to

		trace individual claimants.



A.E.	90% are in F/E. P.o.W. organisation:  no diffy in finding them.



P.T.	No one has protested to me against my announcement.



H.M.	Feeling in H/C. is tht. prs. in Jap. hands shd. be compensated for 

		past suffering not present need.



A.E.             x/	Shall we ask M/P. to produce a plan for giving the money to 

		ex-Jap. p.o.w.



			Agreed – as at x/.





	4.	Commonwealth Economic Conference.



	a)	Colonial Representation.

O.L.	Panel of observers – none to speak.



Sal.	Suppose P.M. of Malta or Gold Coast came.  Wd be greatly resented

		by Doms.



O.L.	Am against any P.M. coming.  I will guarantee [to have advisers, not		P.M.’s] that P.M.’s don’t come.



Sw.	Diff. to exclude them:-  after C.F.M.



Sal.	They haven’t attended P.M. mtg.

	This a full Ec. Conf.  May be different.



P.M.	O.L. shd. represent Colonies himself.



H.M.	Cd O.L. have them here for consultn outside the Conference.



P.M.	Once here, he will creep in.

	O.L. must represent Colonies at Conference – that is his duty.



O.L.	They are v. large dollar earners.

	Cd restrict no. to 6.



P.M.	And offered more than you please.



Sal.	How keep them out of P.M. M. in May?



R.A.B.	At C.F.M. we kept them out of confl discussions.



Sal.	Cdn’t they come as advisers to O.L. but not attendg. the mtgs.



P.M.	V. diff. to draw another line apart from “Dom. status”.



Sal.	Test is the constitl status, not how much dollars they earn.



O.L.              {	I will ask some advisers on basis tht. they don’t attend mtgs.

                   *{

R.A.B.          {	And invite them also to official mtg. in September.



Sw.	Measures to be passed by legislatures with unofficial majorities.

		Much easier to get along with that if they had bn. represented.



R.A.B.	b)	I had better not go to Mexico.  Will send Salter instead.





	5.	Conservative Party – Aims &amp; Objects.



P.M.	Nat. Union of Conservative &amp; Unionist Assocns propose tht. 

		membership cards shd. state objects of Party.



L.P.	I will talk to them.  I don’t like this wording.



					[Enter  J.T.

	6.	Exercise Mainbrace.



A.E.	Laid on by Shape w’out consultn with us until late stage.

	Concerned about part of it w’in Baltic – esp. that near Bornholm.

		Exercise assumes B. captured (&amp; we hold it as R.) &amp; others

		liberate it.



                 x|	Danish suggn &amp; Norway approves.

                   |	R. know of it:  &amp; articles are in Pravda saying it’s provocative.

	In view of x/, I suggest we verify tht. D. really want to be so bold,

		explain risks - &amp; go on with it if they accept.



P.M.	V. risky – mght. be grave trouble.  Visit wdn’t hurt:  but naval 

		exercises wd. look provocative.  Put it bluntly to D. (&amp; to U.S.)

		tht. this is pretty bold.



A.E.           y/	This sort of plan ought to go to N.A. Council.



Al.	Cd cut out the landing of Bornholm, probably, if thought wise.



A.E.	Shd you go into Baltic at all.



P.M.	We ought not to go inside Baltic at this time.



A.E.	Public discn in D. - &amp; Govt. have toughly said it’s our territory.  Don’t

		want to discourage unnecessarily.



Al.	Cd Danes do inside Baltic alone?



P.M.	R. wd. like that even less.

	I wd. feel safer if U.S. were in it.



A.E.	They are in main exercise.



A.E.	Now that R. have complained, I don’t like climbing down.

			

			Agreed:  Advise D. &amp; N. not to have operations 

			                      w’in Baltic.

			               y/ to be pursued by F.O. &amp; M/D.





	7.	Egypt:  Rodeo.



Al.	Amb. says we cd. stand down now, so long as no ostentatious troop

		or ship movemts.  We cd. accept that limitation.

			                

			              Agreed			[Exit  J.T.





	8.	Germany:  Contractual Settlements.



A.E.	First thought of Party leaflet.  Then thght. C.O.I. wd. be better.

		But may be said we are using it for Party purposes.



P.M.	Policy introduced by late Govt. – only diffce is timing.

R.A.B.	Frankly political at end.  And proposed to put it out thro’

		Post Offices etc.

	

	P.8. says much on attitude twds. G. contribn.

	Starts a new principle.



A.E.	I thght. it quite objective.  Text can be altered if you wish.



R.A.B.	If you delete last section (because political) it will be less use.  Mght.

		be better to use Party channel.



P.M.	Then you admit tht. our f. policy is Party policy.

	Better to alter the pamphlet, but use C.O.I.

			

			Agreed:   text to be circulated.





	9.	Commonwealth P.M. Meeting. 1953.



Sal.	All agree, tho’ Malan may not come.  Inform all P.M.’s.

	Announce mid/Sept.

			

			Agreed.
