C.C. 19(51)							20th December 1951



		1.	Coal Prices.		[Enter Sw., D.S., Eccles. Miss H.



 L.	5/= increase.  Will cover all but £2 m.



P.M.	Wd. sooner have had this out together with other increases eg. food



L.	Cdn’t have done it earlier because wage award only accepted 2 days ago.



D.S.	Will mean increased steel prices.  



W.M.  	And freights etc.,?  



L. 	Not for 6 mos.



P.M.	Want design in all this – announcemt. of a package implying a considered scheme.  Otherwise, discredit.



	Price increase approved.





		2.	Korea.



A.E.	All our other amendmts. accepted by U.S.   But “it wd. in all probability not be possible to confine hostilities ….”  Good enough.

	U.S. have themselves told Can. Aust. NZ. and S. Africa.





		3.	Economic Situation.



R.A.B.	Decisions needed.  i) Saving on Civil Estimates.  Between £80-100 m.  May have as aim to get at least below current year.  Say £80 m.

	ii)  Saving of £50 m. on Health &amp; Education.

	This wd. mean 1/= on prescriptions : something on dentists. (short of suspension) to yield about £7.5 m. also Opthalmic and miscellaneous.  I wd. not add 2d. to stamp because deals only with insured popn.



H.C.	Health.	  Prefer lesser alternative.  Wd. bring total slightly below current year - £395.5 m.



R.A.B.	Assistnce Bd.  It’s pensioners etc. who will be most hit.



Ch.	V. diff. to reconcile all this with pledges.  Can’t relate them to b/paymts.

	Wd. prefer to hold hospitals down to current year – saving £29 m.

	Plus 1/= on prescriptions.



R.A.B.	New system of budgeting and financial control over hospitals – will save 5% but not for a year.  If you make straight cut, they will shut beds.



P.M.	Increased adminve. costs of hospitals.



H.C.	Due to public accountability.



W.M.	Yes : Also ⅔rds of hosp. expre. is outside control of management because salaries fixed by Whitley Councils etc.



A.E.	Pledged not to cut social services.  These proposals do, except for (a) and (e) and perhaps (d).  Have we to take such heroic decisions?  Do (a) and (e) – save £21 m.



W.	Don’t encourage appln to Assistance.  Bad for morale.



R.A.B.	Dental Services are a scandal.  Dentists profiteer : and children get no treatment.



	We promised greater value for money.  Making a charge doesn’t cut

            x/	the service.  Will consider with M/H. some other means of improving dental service at less cost : emphasis on children and mothers.



M.F.	a) and e) plus something on dentists.  



A.E.  	I agree.



P.M.	I approve a) and e).



Ch.	Extra £27 m. for hospitals, for 1951/52.  



H.C. 	About £15 m. on wage awards we can’t control.



		Agreed (provisionally)  a), modified b) as at x/. and e) c) and d) 	to be looked at from angle of improving service.  Total saving 	to be secured : at least £25 m.



	Education Service.



F.H.	School meals.  Believe I can save ½ to ¾ m. by cheaper administration.

	Wd. sooner do it that way.



		Agreed :	 No addition to price or reduction of food : seek 			 all economies by adminn.



P.M.	School age – lop off last year.  Want this considered – memo. shd. be prepared.  No need to give assurance to T.U.C. for legn. is required.



R.A.B.	Am doing this in consultn. with M/Edn.

P.M.	I must at least be able to say we have examined it.

	I want before end Jan. a detailed list of savings eg. on (c).   *

	My line wd. be to pet the teachers, build the schools and knock 1 year off the age.



F.H.	Plan (d) is necessary to support solvency of superannuation fund.

	Report on state of fund was published in Spring.



R.A.B.	Legn. in late Summer.  Can announce it then as part of ordinary accounting procedure.  Take credit for it now in total ????



P.M.	I favour going on with the bldg. of schools – but less expensive ones.

	For we must get smaller classes.



D.E.	Investmt. P’mme suggests £8.9 m.  That is too low because of steel shortage.  

	Think it’s more likely to be £15 m.



F.H.	This plan [sic]



R.A.B.	Can see £25 m. out of this.



A.E.	Then let up on (d).



R.A.B.	Will do nothg. on (d) wh. can’t be agreed with N.U.T. as normal method of accountancy.



		Agreed.	Secure saving of £25 m. subject to above.

				viz, total of £50 m. on Health and Education.



	Civil Aviation.



R.A.B.	B.E.A. and B.O.A.C. are making smaller losses.



	Information Services.



Sal.	Not so easy to abolish COI.  Many Dpts. use it.  Proceeded therefore by lopping off services altogether eg. films, lectures.  Plus flat cut of 5% on all Home expenditure.

	Overseas. Have not cut B.B.C. (as yet).  Most on Br. Council (500.000)

	Have asked Ty. to report on COI by end/January.

	N. Savings Cttee. spending £360.000 pa.



P.M.	Are Socialists speaking on N. Savings?  We did.  



R.A.B.  	Will enquire.



P.M.	Will M/W. submit his suggns. for economy – to Sub Cttee. and to me.



	Civil Service.



R.A.B.	Aim at 15/20.000 – will give rise to diffies.

	Better to proceed by cutting whole services.  Will get prs. 12/15.000.



	Utility Scheme.				[Exit F.H.



P.T.	As in memo.



P.M.	Authy. to prepare legn.  Discuss with L.P. and M.F. and keep in touch with R.A.B.



	Ministerial Cars.



Sal.	Complained of circular.

	Better to give tax relief for wages of a chauffeur.



P.M.	To D.S. – make me a report.

	W.O. are making 10% cut.

	Recall this circular for review.





		4.	Investment Programme.



R.A.B.	Suggest I preside over a Cttee. to examine P’mme.



H.M.	On basis of finishing in a year we shd. complete 230.000.

	in 1952.  Can’t finish less.  At 215.000, we shd. have to stop work in October.

	We shd. make all we can as soon as we can.

	On P’mme 1953 wd. be worse than ’52.



R.A.B.	Outlook beyond 1952 depends on softwood and bldg. industry.

	Only 105 m. allotted to Service works.  They can prove need for 140/150 m.

	To do H.M.’s plan we shd. have to spend another £8 m. (mostly in dollars) on softwood.



H.M.	We may fail.  At least let me try.

	Won’t take ⅓rd more materials to make 300.000 via 200.000.

	Can switch fr. flats to houses to save steel.	)

	Reduced standards.  2 bed-room house via 3	)   etc.



R.A.B.	May Cab. endorse 2(e) in Sub. Cttee. report.

	Then may I discuss investment p’mme with Ministers concerned.



H.M.	May I start housing on basis of my memo?



R.A.B.	May I consider P’mme – with housing as 1st priority.



P.M.	Yes : consider on 28/12 – Cabinet.     *



R.A.B.	C.44.  I agree in principle.

	M/W. and M/Housing to meet Chancell.  Friday.





		5.	Manpower.



W.M.	Want only authy. to discuss with repves. of industry, not to announce.
