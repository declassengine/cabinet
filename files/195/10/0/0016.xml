C.C. 16(51)							11th December 1951



		1.	Government Expenditure.			[Enter Ch.Whip.



P.M.	Do ‘em in batches, when Parlt. is mtg. and can explode – once.

	Don’t dribble them out.

	This shd. have come to Cab.



J.S.	We didn’t know M/E. were going to do it.

	Haven’t sent out circular.  Can’t do it now.  Must wait.



P.M.	Nothg. like this shd. issue w’out Cab. authority.





		2.	Legislation Programme.



P.T.	Bill on Waiver of Claims shd. be added.  To prevent G. from procdg. against B. subjects for actions done during war.



Sim.	It is overdue.



H.C.	P’mme overloaded.  Will try to squeeze this in.

	This allows no time for the 3 major Bills.  These are minor Bills wh. can be pushed on while you are waitg. for these.



L.	More time will be needed on Road Haulage.  Will make a policy report to Cab. in 10 days or so.  Main problem : growth of C. Licence work has ruined the businesses wh. were taken over and there’s now no “good will” to sell back.  Possible remedy : a small levy per ton mile on all goods carried by road to provide a fund recouping Govt. loss.  Will also have to widen it up to cover road/rail co-opn. as well.   Eg. eliminatg. small rlway stations and serve them by coach.



P.M.	You may ask for a small Cab. Cttee later.  Build up our plan

               *	collectively.



R.A.B.	A few addl. Bills on a/c of economic p’mme.

	All fiscal measures will have to wait for Budget – wh. will be late in Apl.



A.E.	German debt settlement.  If we get it, we shall need legn.  Not controversial probably.



P.M.	Can massacre the innocents.



H.C.	But must get our 3 main Bills.



P.T.	Monopolies Bill shd. be ready early in Feb.  Am consultg. M.F. and Att.Genl.  Leg. Cttee by mid January.



H.C.	No standing Cttees.  Much time on the floor.



P.M.	Mght. have to use guillotine or time table procedure.

	

						                        [Exit Ch.Whip

		3.	Dunkirk Memorial.				[Enter A.H.



A.H.	Commn. want to know wthr. Cab. wd. favour largesse Memorial.



A.E.	No need for anything bigger.



P.M.	Was a big thing.  



I.  	Has passed into E. Language.



P.M.	Favour somethg. a bit bigger – say £50.000.



A.E.	Not a victory.



Sim.	The dead would not wish more than a modest memorial.



A.H.	To get somethg. significant, we wd. have to go beyond £100.000.



P.M.	Let us see what we can get for £23.000. If we think it unworthy we cd. consider makg. a contribn. fr. Exchequer.



R.A.B.	Will there then be others?



A.H.	Dunkirk was a unique deliverance.



Sal.	Mght ask for contribns.



		Agreed :	(Picture of £23.000.  Rough sketch of £100.000

				(Not on precedents for public subscription.

					

							[Exit A.H.

		4.	Counsellors of State.



Sim.	By Act 1937 only persons eligible are those in succession to Throne.

	This limits choice v. narrowly.  To extend that, amending legn. is necessary.

	Lord Harwood wd. be next in succession.  Not a v. good name for this purpose.



H.C.	V. tiresome legn.

	Can’t we wait and rush thro’ amendg. legn. if there is illness.



Sim.	No one cd. then appoint the Commn. to give assent.



P.M.	An announcement will have to be made –as in my brief)

	                                                       

Sim.	Comments already made by Levi.			     )   x



P.M.  	Record  *



P.M.	Add high officers.  



I. 	Doms won’t have that.



P.M.	No action before King is about to leave.

	Re-consider m’while.

	But draft legn. m’while.

	Authorise Palace to make statement at x/. (M.F. to draft and submit to P.M. who mght issue thro’ his P.R.O. (!)





		5.	Egypt.



A.E.	Amb. called.  Not to break off relations.  I gave him statement of our action in Egypt and reasons for it.  He fears relns. will be broken off, and sitn. will deteriorate – anarchy developing in E.

	I therefore repeated our posn. : said Treaty was good : accepted tht. their view was not tht. it was bad Treaty : we were ready to negotiate.

	But they must control violence by bands in Zone.

	Hope these repns. will reach E. Cab. when they meet tonight.





		6.	Korea.



A.E.	U.S. have given us a text of the warning.  Think it goes too far.

	We have amended draft.  “We affirm ….. (get formula fr. F.O.) 

	“Might” vice “will” be imposs. to localise hostilities as hitherto.

	C.O.S. prefer that formula to U.S. draft.

	U.S. don’t like our informing older Doms.  (Can, A. and N.Z.)



I.	We told them earlier part of the story.  Can’t close down on them now.

	Unless I can say its because of U.S. veto.

	They have troops fighting in Korea.



A.E.	Means risking U.S. closing up on us.



I.	Cd. say “we are playing this hand alone : will consult you before anything is decided.



P.M.	Don’t repeat to Doms. the intermediate stages.  But tell them as soon as a result is achieved.  A.E. and I to concert a formula.



		Agreed.

 

	7.	Visit to Washington.



A.E.	Amb. says shall P.M. raise financial aid.  Presumes not.  As we shall have paid interest on 31/12.  If it’s not to be raised, he wd. like to say so now.



P.M.	Wd prefer to ask for goods – steel and finished equipment.

	1¾ t. of coal to a ton of steel.  But steel in value is 3 or 4 times as precious.  1 or 1½ m. tons of steel wd. make a vast diffce. to us.

	Get that and take it as a gift, rather than ask for money.



A.E.	Fin-aid they wd. prefer not to handle thro’ P.M.  Either before or after he goes.  And they wd. prefer “after”.



R.A.B.	Their diffies. are obvious.

	But Harriman hopes we shall get dollars.  It’s being delayed already.  If we are slow on it, it will be delayed even longer.

	Our deficit (prospect) worsens.  Batt was for putting off talks.  No reason, however, why we shdn’t announce loan decn. and try to clear dollar aid too before P.M. arrives.  Let us at least try.  If we can’t do it before, I agree we must p’pone until after P.M.’s visit.

	Batt favours P.M. talkg. in terms of materials via money.



A.E.	I will tell Amb. to talk to Batt, to whom R.A.B. has expressed his view, and will repeat it tomorrow.





		8.	European Army.



P.M.	Read letter from Monty.

	Tho’ I had not spoken to him in advance.



A.E.	Yes : but remember R. attitude.  German National Army is the provocative element in all this, for them.

	French won’t press us to come in now.  Nor will U.S. – I’ve heard from Acheson.  But we must consider what we do if this plan fails.

	R. wd. dislike admn. of G. to N.A.T.O.
