C.C. 59(52)							12th June 1952



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter Sw., B.H.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	F.A. debate.  Opposn. want 2 days by end/June on F/E and S.E.A. and p’pone German ratification debate.



A.E.	That and Europe is main current topic.  Date is for our convenience.

	Can’t have F/E. at same time because need a Motion on Europe.

	No internatl. hurry – N. Baker suggests delay until G. law ques. is out of way.  Somethg. in that.

	Give them a day of their own on F.E.  Keep another 1 or 2 later for Europe.



H.C.	We can’t give any more of our time than 1 day for ratification debate.





		2.	Central African Federation : White Paper.



Sal.	Publn. on 18th June.  Debate in H/L. 24/6.  G.W. says H/C. won‘t want debate for 2 wks after publn.



P.M.	No harm in having prelimy. discn  in H/L.





		3.	Economic Situation : Reserves.



R.A.B.	Weakness in confidence in sterling.  Spot rate has fallen.  Doesn’t reflect facts – reserves are being held.

	Want therefore to say somethg. to strengthen posn. eg. “Reserves have fallen only £10 m. since end/March.”  To bring out strengths of recent movemt.

	Then I must say – no quarterly figures till end/July, but am reviewg. periods of announcemt.  May have to do weekly – to avoid crisis atmosphere.



	Wd. go on to say must put b/p first in all our policies.  H/C. will be

                x/	infd fr. time to time of the various steps wh. may have to be taken to secure this object.  I have in mind statement before end/July on review of econ. policy.



A.E.	Doubts x/.  Will be asked when.



P.M.	Better to act than to foreshadow.



A.E.	Don’t volunteer this.  Say, on suppl., if asked, House will be told if and when further steps are needed.



P.M.	Will also provoke speculn re nature of the steps.

Sw.	Also, main need is more work by nation, on exports.

	

								[Exit B.H.

		4.	Supplementary Pensions Scheme.		[Enter O.P. G.Ll.



W.M.	Suppl. schemes must be tidying up no new principle.  They accepted that.

	Enquiry – they won’t have at all.  Wd. boycott it.  Suspicious because of last Govt. policy.

	Suggest we drop that.  Don’t hold up the particular schemes.



O.P.	Form of interim enquiry.  Want one into future finance of Ins. Fund.

	The reserves will be eaten up by pension costs.

	Want enquiry – Labour Party are hatching their policy, wh. is likely to be more expensive.  Cd. be done w’in any Act.  Form cd. be discussed with R.A.B. because of effect on national finances.



R.A.B.	I agree – refer to M.N.I. Advisory Cttee.

	M’while T.U.C. may get into a better mood.



		Agreed.

							[Exit G.Ll. and O.P.

		

		5.	Defence Priorities.			[Enter D.S., A.H., de L.



D.S.	Working pretty well.  Tho’ firms are ordering w’out specifying dates when requd. and getting material unduly early.

	Canberras – we may have a surplus to sell. eg. to Australia.  Menzies is firm tht. A.’s effort shd. not be wasted on munitions prodn.

	Have his list, and think we can supply most of them.



P.M.	Told Alex to try to sell more Centurions to Canada.  



D.S. 	And U.S. are nibbling again.



D.S.	F.4 and B.35 now ready to go into prodn. now.  Am discussg. with R.A.B. – don’t prejudge his decision.  But we must go forward despite C.O.S. change in strategy.



W.M.	If defence cuts, must be no gap before exports come in.  Can’t have arms factories declaring labour redundant.



A.E.	This is advantage of selling arms.  Can find fairly respectable customers who can pay.



D.S.	Suppose no cuts on priority types of aircraft.  Want similarly no delay in ordering new types when they are ready.  



R.A.B.	P’pone super-priority for B.35 until we have seen the def. p’mme cuts strategy memo.

	No objection to placing the orders.  



D.S.	Content with that.



Ch.	Suppose we don’t want them.  V. small no. – only 50, and in 1956/7.  Shd. we order these in advance.  May conclude tht. only atom bombing is worth while on strategic offensive.



D.S.	If we delay orders, we must put in more Canberra’s to keep labour together – and we are at risk of having too many Canberras.



		Agreed :	place orders, defer super priority.



							         [Exit D.S.

		6.	Visit to U.S. Strategic Bombers.



A.E.	Not so formidable as I thought.  On balance I think risk may be taken.



P.M.	Traffic is considerable.  The 20 aren’t coming all at once.  That changes the picture.

	Minimise publicity.



		Agreed.				[Exit A.H., de L.





		7.	High Commission Territories.



Sal.	S.A. Govt. want to publish documents.  We come out pretty well.

	We had better present our own (fuller) selection.

	They want to publish in a week or so.  We want ours a bit later because of Central Afr. W. Paper.  Can leave 10 days or 14 after that and then bring out the other.



H.C.	If ours is a bit diff. won’t there be trouble?



Sal.	The same documents – only they will print only extracts from some.



P.M.	There can be no ques. of handing these territories over to S.A. Govt.

	Smuts might have got them because people felt confidence in him.

	But no-one will want to cede them now.





		8.	Menzies’ Visit : Trade Talks.



P.T.	Some progress on 2 – less on 2.

		1)  Existg. contracts : M. likely to give some satisfn. to U.K. manufrs.

		2)  Hardship : goods specially made for A. wh. can’t be sold 				elsewhere :

		tho’ they will count v. quota.  Shall press him on that.

		3)  Textiles, china, lace.  Pressed for increased quota, but made no

		impact on M.  Shall urge further, but doubt success.

		4)  Even under existg. quotas, discrimn. in favour of U.K.  He won’t do

		that – tho’ it means takg. goods fr. eg. Italy “tho’ he pays in (st. area) 		gold.  Reasons a) G.A.T.T. – arguable b) fear of offending Eur. 			customers – but they won’t refuse wool. Real reason, doesn’t want to 		spoil his chance of U.S. loan.

	So, at present, we have achieved nothg. worth having.

	Shall have to announce results.  P.Q. to P.M. Tuesday.



Sal.	He may get some lee-way fr. Canberra before Tuesday.

	New quota for next year : in that he may give a priority to Class B. wh. includes potters and textiles.



Sw.	His speech has created impn. contrary to his line in conversn.

	Press thinks he is pressing Imp. Pref. on us, and we are unwilling.



Sal.	His speech related to a genl. Comm. agreemt. after wh. we go to U.S.

	But he won’t proceed unilaterally in advance of that – because of U.S. and also his own special interests in Austr.



A.E.	Shd. consider Comm. economic mtg. eg. in autumn.  Get it clear with M. before he goes.



R.A.B.	Agreed on Comm. F. Min. Mtg. in Mexico in Sept.

	Suggest Econ. confce. if needed, in Oct. in Ldn.



P.T.	Shan’t be ready.

	Get agreemt. in principle with M. before he leaves.  Leave timing until later.



Sal.	Raise these at Cab. with Menzies – Tuesday at 11 am.



P.M.	V. well.  M’while views shd. be clarified on economic 

	mtg.



R.A.B.	Must be ready to talk to U.S. in Dec. (Comm. mtg. in Nov.  And shd. be P.M.’s – Fin. Ministers alone wdn’t do.





		9.	British Transport Commission.		[Enter L-Boyd.



L.B.	P.Q. today.  Apptmts. end in Aug. or Sept.  What shall we do?

	We want their co-opn. in interim period.

	Want to offer today to renew all apptmts. for one year, tho’ not necessarily in their present jobs.



L.	Passenger Executive – all have bn. paid, and it has never worked at all.  They at least must resign.



P.M.	Must secure some economies.

P.M.		Cost, at most, wd. be 6 months’ compensn.
