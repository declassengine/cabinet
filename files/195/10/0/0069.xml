C.C. 55(52)							22nd May 1952



		1.	Durham County Council : Closed Shop.   [Enter Sw., B.H., and 									[Miss H.



P.M.	Read answer to P.Q. proposed by M/H. and L. Govt.

	I think action of Co. Council is as bad as D.C. Thompson.  Don’t wish to prevent teachers fr. taking a stand against Council.  I was in favour of a strike v. tyranny.



H.M.	Powers vary.  Those of M/E. are stronger than mine.

	Right course : apply for injunction.



F.H.	Last time they gave in.  My machine now in action : teachers have repd. to me (s.68) tht. action of Council is unreasonable : I have asked for obsns on receipt of reply I can give them direction.  If they disregard it I can act under s.74(i).

	Teachers wd. send in notice – 3 months! to lapse at beginning of next term.

			Amended formula approved.

							[Exit F.H.



		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Adjournment for recess on Friday.

	Shd. I promise resumptn. on Tues. 10/6. : or make that contingent on getting Finance Bill before we rise.



R.A.B.	Shall finish, I think, by sitting late next week.



P.M.	Say we “hope” to return on 10/6.  May help to get Bill through.



B-H.	Threaten, but in moderate terms.  Our side need warning to curtail speeches.



H.C.	Korea statement?  



Al. 	Thursday wd. do.  Will submit to P.M.



H.C.	Air Transport policy : Wednesday.  Statement.



H.C.	What about statement on leakage re Transport W. Paper?



P.M.	Stated facts as known.  Propose to say “no source of leakage has bn. discovered : every care was taken to preserve secrecy”.

	Will make statement accordingly today.

							[Exit B.H.

 

	3.	Coal.



P.M.	If it piles up, work will slacken off.

	Urgent need for export.  But risk of hard winter.



L.	Can’t fall into trap of sending too much away.  No risk of excessive stocks wh. wd. cause slackening in work.  Not above normal.  M’while am sending a little more abroad.

	Will circulate memo.



R.A.B.	Vital export – esp. now we are paying gold to Europe for our imports : and when we need materials to increase our steel prodn.  The most important export we have.



P.M.	Must discuss this next week.





		4.	Cotton Imports.



Sw.	As in memo.



R.A.B.	Sw. and P.T. have come down a good way on their original demand.  But I wd. prefer 57% - a saving of 7 m. dollars.  (143 m.



Ch.	Average of last year was only 45%.  



Sw. 	But everyone knows they have bn. receivg. 57%.  



Ch. 	Can you tell Commn. they will have to be content with less if premium doesn’t rise.



P.M.	Favour 60% because distress in Lancs.



R.A.B.	Only psychological.  



Sw. 	Not quite.  At 60% will be much easier to hold off Brazilian market and force price down.



R.A.B.  	I will accept 60%.	  Agreed.

								[Enter D.S.



		5.	Economic Policy.



P.M.	Disposed to let C.R.A. and Gaitskell see Part I. in suitable form.



R.A.B.	Will revise it with that in view.



R.A.B.	Reserves.  Signs that drain may start again.  Forward rate is tending to drop.  Paying 100% gold to E.P.U.  Press campaign (Times and Fin. Times) is giving impn. of lack of solidarity in Govt. – helped by lack of Tory support for Govt. policy.  Fin. Times y’day on E.P.L. was disgraceful.  Wd. be helpful if P.M. wd. tackle Brendan.



P.M.	I certainly will see him.



R.A.B.	Don’t want to raise external sterling now.  May I leave it that I will bring this up again to Cab. when I think right moment has come.  Shall talk to Menzies re Austr. balances.



	Need for work this summer.  a) Burden of defence on metal industries. Want this set up before Whitsun. (What?)  (b) Overseas commitments shd. also be reviewed w’out loss of time.



P.M.	What have we to pay under Colombo Plan?  



R.A.B. 	Not much.

	Reading has done well on that.

                 *	Let Ch. circulate to Cabinet his minute to me.



O.L.	Memo. overstresses diff. exports and under emphasises simple ones.

	Follows Socialist pattern of seeking to export manuf. goods.

	Primary materials are much easier to sell.  eg. hampering of col. dev. by lack of steel : while we use steel to make goods to force on U.S. or cotton on Brazil.  Much too much stress on forcing sales of metal goods on diff. markets.

	Coal also is same story.



P.M.	Processed goods contain bigger element of wages and profits,.  We aren’t primary producers.  Cdn’t keep 50 m. here w’out quality exports.



O.L.	Yes – but ques. of balance and emphasis.

	Investment at home is same.  Steel shortage is keeping back developmt. of plants wh. cd. increase output of steel, while the steel goes into the manuf. industries.

	No mention in memo. of developmt. of our overseas assets, save threat of cut (para. 12).  Tho’ this is main hope of redressing balance of world trade between E. and West and off setting our dependence on U.S. production.  



L.	We are not far off the right balance.



O.L.	Sterling.  Can’t preserve strength with sight liabilities so heavy.

	M’tain my support for funding sterling balances – only a ques. of timing.

	Para. 4.  Insuff. emphasis on gt. rise in national income.  Substantial surplus at home.



P.T.	Accept main line of memo.

	Draw special attentn. to para. 9.  Priority for exports.

	At present prodn. is sub-ordinated eg. to defence.  We cd. expand exports if that were not so.



	Support O.L.’s views.  We shd. devote more to bldg. up prod. capacity of Comm. – long term soln. lies there.  But Comm. must then plan, with us, to take less from dollar world.  Shd. discuss this ques. with Menzies.



P.M.	Need not announce cut in defence.  Just see we don’t get it done so fast.

            	* No interference with super priorities.*  They don’t make much impact.

	Orders for other things cd. be slowed down.



D.S.	Not overnight, or we wd. have to compensate.  But we cd. do it over a time.



	Cd. R.A.B. give us a figure of what increased exports are needed from metal industries.  M’while I am seeing what I cd. do.

	Don’t want arbitrary cuts on defence.  Want liberty to plan diversion with best use of steel.
