C.C. 21(52)							21st February 1952



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter Ch. Whip.



H.C.	Labour motion Fri. on closer co-opn. in sterling area.  Tory amendmt. Salter will spk.  Divn. likely : Ministers shd. attend, if not paired.

	Business for next week.

	F.A. debate.	H. Morrison opens : P.M. follows  :  A.B. later : Sel.Ll. will follow him :  26/2.  H. Macm. winds up.

	Defence debate.  Motion to approve (or to take note of) Wh. Paper.

	28/2.



P.M.	Last year I think it was “take note”.  That wd. suffice.



H.C.	I agree.  “Approve” wd. invite dissidence in Labour Party wh. on this, we don’t want to do.



B.H.	3 line whip wd. be needed anyway.  We cd. carry ‘approve’,

	Mght lead to amendmt. by Bevan.  Does this inject unnecessary controversy?



		Agreed : “approve”.



	Spokesmen  : not yet decided, save P.M.





		2.	B.B.C. Charter.



H.C.	Runs out soon.  G.P.O. were to make new plan.  We shall have to give a days debate.



L.P.S.	Embarrassing sitn. developing.  My Cttee. appted.  About 9 Tories in H/C. interested in this, are campaigning for end of B.B.C. monopoly.  Our Cttee. favour maintenance of monopoly durg. period of this Charter.  It isn’t statutory : P.M.G. has power to give another licence in addn. to B.B.C.  Time not ripe for it yet.

	Sponsored p’mmes wd. not be improvement, in our view.

	But at mtg. of 80 in H/C. 78 favoured ending monopoly.



P.M.	Must discuss this at Cab. next week.  At a mtg. when I’m not 

                *	troubled with H/C. speeches as I shall be on Tues. and Thurs.



L.P.S.	1922 Cttee. are to discuss in wk. after next : asked me to go.



P.M.	Why not receive a delegation from them?



L.P.S.	Have seen them in small nos. but made no impression.



R.A.B.	Promoters of this movement have axes to grind – many of them.



W.	Also doctrinaire view.



P.M.	Special Cab. on Wed. 11.30 am.  Memo. by L.P.S.

	Ch. Whip to report feeling in H/C. (B.H. 1922 Cttee

	will not have met by then.)



							[Exit  B-H.

		3.	John Deere Project.			[Enter Sw. and T.D.



P.M.	….  Why not make an exception in this case?  Good grounds for it.



H.C.	Any others cut back which are American?  



P.T. 	One U.S. and one Canadian.



P.M.	Cd. not B/T. overdraw on allcn up to10%.  



Sw.  	Steel allocn. already overdrawn by 5%.



O.L.	If we discourage U.S. investment, we don’t know when repercussions will fall.  If this were U.S. money, no doubt we shd. facilitate it.  Even as it, may have discouraging effect on U.S. investors – for a well known firm.



R.A.B.	Can’t justify this to Massey Harris.



J.S.	They are here : only asking for extension of existg. factory.



Sw.	We have cut down steel for firms’ manufg. agric. impl. for export.

	Any extra steel given to them wd. go into exports f’with.



W.	Tell them they can go on if they will find the money.  



Sw.  	I wd. then risk over allocn. of the steel.



J.S.	Faute de mieux a starting date in ’53 mght save them fr. packing up.

	They have spent £200.000 in dollars on plant.



P.T.          x/	Shall I put it to them tht. if they will pay for bldg. we will make the steel available?



P.M.	Mistake to allow this project to drop.



H.M.	Why not try x/. on basis tht. if they decline, we will approve

	J.S.’s plan.  viz., try x/. first.



W.           y/	Try x/ first.  Bring it up to Cab. again and if that fails.



		Agreed : as at y/.



		(P.M. re-affirming that it’s mistake not to grant at once what 	the firm desire.)
