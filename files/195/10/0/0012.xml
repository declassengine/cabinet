C.C. 12(51)							28th November 1951



		1.	Economic Situation.			[Ch.Whip and E.E.B.



P.M.	Prelimy. discn. this pm.  Continue tomorrow.



R.A.B.	We haven’t done enough.		       £320m

	Quarterly statement will show same rate ($900m) as last.  Reserves

	will fall to £850 m. by end/year.  S.A. deficit 400 m. in ’52 faces us.

	This announcemt. wd. lead to greater run.

	Effect of earlier steps.  Fnl. rate is a little better.  Posn. not due wholly to lack of confidence : no increase in that since 26/10.

	E.P.U. posn. is v. bad.  Soon have to settle 80% of our deficits in gold.

	Thght. we shd. make interim statement before House rises, to counter effect of quarterly statement.  Intended to suggest holdg. H/C. for this purpose.  After discn. with P.M. and others see diffy. of this.

	Alternative : summon Parlt. a week earlier in Jan.  Prepare statement of drastic action and legn. necessary and make it on 22/1.

	Statement wd. have to be : 1. Increasg. exports (can’t cut more imports) save prs. petrol).  Reduce home investmt. and consumptn. and defence and plant machinery to be cut by £100 m. (at expense of industry and agric).  About £150 m. p.a. off defence : i.e. off full p’mme : and transfer emphasis from Army to Air.



	2.  Govt expenditure cuts.  Health Service :  £40-50 m.  Education : nothg. above £10 m. w’out sacking teachers.



P.M.	Underpaid teachers and overcrowded schools is not ideal.

	Consider reducg. leaving age.

	Don’t reduce bldg. of schools, or the pay of teachers.



R.A.B.	M/Ed. wd. rather start at 6.  But wd. mean sacking teachers.



P.M.	Not so popular in homes.



Ch.	Lose women in industry via young recruits at 15.



R.A.B.	About £5 m. on C. Service.  Total therefore only £60-70 m. unless we trim food subsidies.  Suggd. £200 m of these, offset by f. allowances etc. of £60 m.  Ty. dividend.  T.U.’s think it wd. lead to increased wage demand.  £200 m = 1/6 p. head.

	2/6 to o.a.p. wd. cost only £20 m.  Weakness : wages claims.



	If we announce in Jan. we cdn’t say anything in Dec.

	Then for consn. wthr. we shdn’t also have Finance Bill, incldg. E.P.T.

	If we did food subsidies, we shd. need some fiscal action v. the more rich.  If we don’t, Jan. Fin Bill cd. be restricted to E.P.T.

	Health legn. wd. be needed.  Also prs. on educn proposals.



PM.	Don’t act before we’ve considered and am sure they are right.

	Don’t act piecemeal.

	Must have some time to make a plan.

	Cab. Cttee. to go over the ground and report.  Econ. Cttee plus some others perhaps, eg. A.E.



	Announcemt. pre Xmas wd. be quite contrary to our Parly. strategy for this Session.  Return a week earlier.

	Say before Xmas tht. we are makg. a plan and shall return a week earlier.

	Base it on forecast of last quarters’ out turn.



R.A.B.	Latter wd. damage credit.  Don’t announce Parlt. early return until after Jan 3.  That : bankers’ view.



Ch.	Posn. is not as bad as R.A.B. suggest.



P.T.	To get the exports needed, somethg. like R.A.B.’s measures will be needed.  The sooner the better.

	Advantage in announcg. before P.M. goes to U.S.  Will be said it’s forced on us by U.S. Govt.



P.M.	See no objn. to saying somethg. before Parlt. rises wh. foreshadows action soon after Xmas.

	Cd. b’cast eg. on 15/12.



R.A.B.	Memo. for Cab. by Thurs.



	Agreed.	Appoint small sub Cttee of E.P.C. – calling in other

			Ministers affected.

			No extension of Session.

			Some statement before Xmas to indicate further 			measures will be needed.  Parlt. resume a wk. earlier : 		not before then because Comm. Fin. mtg.



P.M.	I wd. prefer to have H/C. told before they rise when they will resume.  That wd. have to be on Thurs of next week.

		Then I cd. fill it out in b’cast on 15/12.
