C.M. 92 (52)					3rd November, 1952



					[Enter Sw.

1.	    Commonwealth Economic Conference.

a) The Collective Approach



A.E.	Must keep control of decn in our hands until the end – still far off.

	Choice:	

(i)	plan somethg. like this as basis for discn.  But no final commitmt. until we see what emerges from all the discussions. Cttee agree on basis that we aren’t committed – save only Cherwell.



P.M.	Sal. writes – in full agreemt. with course proposed by A.E.



Ch.	 All agree on objective – multilateralism with convertibility.  But I believe we can’t start on this until our econ-posn is strong - &amp; there is no prospect of its becomg. so.  We risk doing this at the v. moment when our b/p becomes diff. in 2nd half of ’53.

	I am only reconciled to discn of this because I doubt if it will go thro’ – U.S. won’t accept it.

	Hope we shall put this up only as a v. tentative idea - &amp; not get tangled up by arguing too strongly for it.



L.	V. important conference.  Both sides of argument will be heard at C.E.C.

Uneasy about going into this too soon.  Full of risks.



R.A.B.	Approach is Mult. Trade &amp; Paymts., not convertibility.  Conv. is not the aim, only an instrument for returng. to multi-lateralism.  If we go into C.E.C. with this aim, we shall be seekg. to escape fr. restrictive system (reducing imports &amp; pushing exports):  if we can float a convertible £ we can look $ in face.

	We must move gradually to it.

	We shd. reserve final decisn to U.K. Cab., when satisfd that condns are right.

	Modificns included in place.

	The 5 b. dollars – no longer in the plan, wh. now suggests working thro’ I.M.F. &amp; re-vitalising it. (Will phase Asiatic Doms).  Amount then available to st. area wd. be only addl $1m over &amp; above frozen $11/3 m.



P.M.	“Stern internal measures” – required in any event.  What are they?



R.A.B.		i) A tight hold on credit.  More flexible under convertibility.

	ii) Investment and consumptn.  Will be less need for cutting imports further if world trade is expanded. 

	iii) Developmt. – in U.K. as well as other Comm. countries.

	iv) Must balance Budget, &amp; for that control expire by l.a.’s and natd indies.

	Canada – criticism of our excessive exp’re on welfare, housg. &amp; even defence.  We shall have to keep public exp’re w’in our means.

But we can’t because of pledges check housg. p’mme unduly.  Hope we can transfer more to private &amp; less to subsidised housing.



A.E.	Can’t take all cuts on Defence.



P.M.	Cd. cut down bldg. other than housing.  e.g. factories.



H.M.	That wdn’t give Budgetary saving.  No ‘investment’ diffy. because unemplt. is beginning in bldg. trade.



R.A.B.	Stiff internal measures wd. be designed to avert unemplt. &amp; high prices.

	We are trying to do too much.  Excess reflected largely in below-line exp’re by l.a.’s &amp; above line exp’re on defence.  We want more into exports, fr. defence &amp; housing.  Pol. imposs. to do anythg. with housing save switch more to private.  On defence, hope for agreemt. with M/D. for ’53, esp. to relieve metal-industry burden.

Shall have to cut civil exp’re – e.g. hospital adminn, education, and costlier subsidies.  Look for £150/200 m. – most of which go to meet increase in defence exp’re.  But all turns on cuts in def. p’mme and switch to private housing.



H.M.	Can’t do any switch in ’53:  p’mme fixed.  My aim is to get as many subsidised as Labour built, and balance up to 300.000 in private.

	“Trying to do too much” – Not for total economy, but too much by public authy.  For prodn is falling &amp; unemplt. rising:  the economy cd. bear more.  Hence our policy shd. be to free people who are willing to do things at private cost.

	I shared many of Prof’s anxieties.  But I am content with proposals as now stress need to put a positive plan to C.E.C.



P.M.	Defence.  Exp’re can be settled only year by year.  M/D. must have a forward plan;  but Cab. can’t be commd to its future years – they must be open to review each year.  



Al.	I accept that wholly.  Make a plan, subject to adjustment annually.



P.T.	Largest obstacle to U.K. industry’s competn is weight of taxation.  Unless we can relieve that, exports must shrink.  Taxn can’t be relieved except by cuts in exp’re either on defence or on welfare state.



J.S.	More diff. to cut welfare this year.  Wd. have bn. easier to do last year.



P.T.	Industry cd. carry this taxn in the 6 yrs. when they cd. sell any exports.  But now sellers’ market has gone &amp; G. &amp; J. are about to revive their competn.

W.M.	Comforted by hearing tht. we retain control  Wd. prefer to avert decn until we know more of the internal measures &amp; their effect on emplt.  We shall keep w’in 400.000 or so this year:  but it wd. be easy to slip upwds. to 1m. or more.

	Severe deflation, defence cuts &amp; drop in exports might produce that next year.



A.E.	Imp. Reference.  No enthusiasm in offl. talks.  Must press the Ministers.

Tho’ not beyond a point.  “Press but not force”.



P.M.	Agree:  but let us not be the first to cast it away.



Sw.	i)  Doms will look to us for a lead.  We must know our own mind &amp;

	    give a lead.

	ii) This is a gradual plan. We remain judges on action.  We shall

	     manage the currency &amp; can apply remedies to protect ourselves.  

                             Convert. is means, not end:  but we can’t recover unless we get

                             back our posn as a centre of world trade.



H.C.	Agree, as basis for discn, so long as final decn is reserved.



M.F.	Agree – put fwd. on a tentative basis, for discussion.  Fear or umemployment.



P.M.	Put this forward &amp; see how it fares.

		   {	But we must show an air of conviction.  Put it boldly and 

		   {	decisively – not as the last stinking of our stinking fish.



	b) Gold.



R.A.B.	Two ques.-  i)  price of gold.  Discuss with Doms &amp; consider with S.A. 	       later how we raise it with U.S.A.

  ii)  re-opening of London Gold market.
