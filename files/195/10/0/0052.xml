C.C. 38(52)							7th April 1952



		1.	Transport.					[Enter Sw., D.S.



L.	Bill will take 2½ months to prepare.



P.M.	Can’t accept that.  Can it not be simplified?  



L.  	No.  



P.M. 	Then a one-clause Bill must be passed to enforce a standstill on refusal of licences [under 1930 Act].  Quite imposs. to justify this at time when rlway fares are going to be raised.



L.	80/90 cases decided, w’out publicity, since Govt. came in.

	Don’t arise from natn. : all under 1930 Act.



P.M.	That was a Labour Govt. Act – based on woes of rlway shareholders.

	Tolerated on that a/c by Tory Govts. in 1930’s.  Difft. now rlways are natd.  That transforms the posn.

	Standstill must apply to 1930 Act.



L.P.	Can go on to consider 1930 Act – but separately.





		2.	Unemployment in Textile Industries.



R.A.B.	Owing to Lancs. recession Press expects concessions on p. tax. £80/100m quoted – wd. mean total removal of tax fr. textiles.

	Alternative approach, preferred by B/T., is to place direct Govt. orders.

	This wd. give certain emplt. – 14.000 p.a. for £10 m. of orders.

	M/S., H.O., M/S., M/N. are in posn. to place about 20/25 m. – 28.000 to 33.000.



	Tax relief wd. affect only 30% of industry.  Not certain people wd. spend the extra money on textiles.  Unsound to do this.

	In May, on Cttee. of Fin. Bill, concessions will be made on p. tax on furn. fabrics, footwear etc.

	Prefer therefore to announce today direct orders : say p. tax must await Cttee Stage, but no ques. of tax holiday or total removal.



L.P.	Uncertainty is v. bad.  £12 m. of goods now held in Lancs.

	R.A.B. shd. be firm on p. tax – otherwise traders will hold back and things will get worse.



A.E.	World over-prodn. of textiles – now : for a time.  Some textile labour must move into other occupns.  We shd. not do anything inconsistent with that.

	Must face that reality.

	Prefer orders to tax relief.  But will they come off future years?

M.F.	Much of mine = restoration of cuts.  More will be needed later.



D.S.	At £25 m, £20 m. wd. be M/S. on defence.  £87 m. this yr. on clothing.

	Balance for 3 year def. p’mme will be £59 m. and the £20 wd. come out of that.



P.M.	Alternative : tell Lancs to go on dole.  Many of them can’t go into def. prodn. or other work.

	10% of unemplt. in cotton, at a time when at large there are more jobs than applicants.  Purely a local evil.  But affects Tory Party v. seriously.



A.E.	Doesn’t help if next year we have no more orders to place.



O.L.	There shd. be some recovery in the trade by 1953.



L.P.	As soon as confidence grows tht. prices won’t drop any further.



Ch.	Over £1.000 m p.a. output.  A 10% change makes an enormous problem.

	But in 2/3 yrs. we must get a shift of labour out of textiles.



W.M.	40.000 increase in unemplt. in Lancs in March = total increase over U.K.  Switch to defence can’t happen until steel available and plants tooled up.  Only 7.000 needed in 1952 in Lancs : 2.200 in Yorks.

	And 70.000 unempld. and more on short time.  Orders wd. help to fill this interval.



D.S.	Possibly 60.000 more needed on aircraft in ’53.



J.S.	We shd. have ordered C.D. Supplies this year, had it not bn. for economy cuts.



A.E.	But, in long term, we must draw down textile production.



L.P.	Same problem in U.S., Canada and Japan.



O.L.	These orders won’t cure whole problem.		[Exit D.S.



		Agreed :	Place £20/25m. direct orders.  Announce today

				“between £20 and £25 m.”

				Supplementary Estimate in due course.



D.S.  	There will be 50% of current years’ p’mme still to be placed.



P.M. 	This shd. be mentioned also today.









	Purchase Tax.



P.M.	Don’t believe orders alone is enough.  Think we shd. do somethg. on p. tax.



R.A.B.	C.117.  Para. 4.  Tax holiday wd. shake confidence.	  Agreed.

		 Para. 5.  Tax doesn’t affect sales or depression.

			  Anomalies of D. scheme ¨some concessions will  be 		  made.  Don’t want to make them in advance of Cttee. 		  Stage.  Must have somethg. to give away then., esp. on 		  fabrics.



		Para. 6.   D. scheme is designed to help top grades (?)



	Want to say today – no tax holiday, D. scheme must stand, will look at particular anomalies in Cttee. stage.



P.M.	Then uncertainty will remain.

	If we announce this now, we shan’t spoil Lancs – ship for ½  of tar.

	Qua. tactics I wd. like it said now – with warning of no more concessions in Cttee.



A.E.	You can make a v. good case for direct orders via tax concessions.

	You spoil that case by small immed. tax concession.



P.T.	H/C. wd. say we were on the run, if we announced 25% cut, and keep up increasg. pressure for more.



H.M.	Believe slump is coming.  P. tax can’t go on indefinitely.  Designed to curtail consumptn. in war.  In slump, we cdn’t use it.

	For the moment, wd. prefer to say we will spend specific sum of money on this eg. £20 m. on orders and £20 m. on tax adjustment.



A.E.	Clothes for Arab refugees.  I will consider this.
