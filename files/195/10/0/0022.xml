C.C. 22(51)						29th December 1951 (3.30 pm.)



		1.	U.S. aid.



P.M.	Read telegram to Harriman.  To be sent by telephone thro’ U.S. Embassy.





		2.	Communists in Civil Service : Positive Vetting.



Ch.	U.S. won’t talk to us about atomic ques. until this ques. of positive vetting is cleared up.  E.E.B. has suggested considn. by a Cttee of Ministers.  Can this be done and results telegraphed to us while in W’ton.



P.M.	Cttee under M.F. shd. examine and give us their views in W’ton.

	A little stiffening up might give us a hand in securing more informn.



	Cttee = M.F. plus 3 colleagues.  O.L., P.T., H.M.





		3.	Egypt : Sterling Balances.



P.M.	Pay £15 m. into special a/c on 1/1/52.  This to be paid to E. under 

            x/	existg. agreemts. as soon as murderous attacks on our soldiers have definitely ceased and are not in our opinion likely to recur.  We shd. then respect our financial obligns. w’out exposing ourselves to charge eg. blood guiltiness for contributg. to resources of a Govt. wh. is killing or trying to kill our men.



A.E.	Riots v. Farouk are now increasing, both in C. and Alex.

	Awkward to have to announce any decn. at all at this stage – open breach now wd. be difficult.



R.A.B.	Unless we renew S.P.A. E. can do nothg.  That is the bigger sanction.  Wd. sooner rely on that.

	Transfer to a special a/c doesn’t avoid breach of agreement.



P.M.	Need not say x/ publicly yet.  Merely tell E. Govt.



R.A.B.	This P.M. plan wd. help ques. credit of sterling.



A.E.	I wd. prefer to give the £5 m. because w’holding it may cause a fuss and I want to avoid that at present.

	But we do thereby damage our moral case.



R.A.B.	If Cab. approve econ. sanctions v. E., Ty. shd. w’draw objns.

	But objn. to diffies. with E. over sterling is tht. E. will try to turn away fr. sterling and seek to sell cotton for dollars or by barter.  Wd. like to consult India (because cotton trade with E) and U.S. first.  For it means E. brkg. out fr. sterling area.



A.E.	This wd. be a mistake. Don’t know what effect it might have on U.S. etc.

	Wd. prefer to fudge it : pay £5 m. and tease E. over the £10 m. and the S.P. Agreemt.



R.A.B.	No publicity need be given to transfer of £5 m.

	When it’s in their No. 1 a/c their use of it will still be governed by S.P. Agreemt.  That expires 31/12/51.  We intend to let Bank continue to give facilities until further notice.  But not to renew Agreemt. pro tem.

	We cd. then suspend particular facilities, as we chose, quite legally.



A.E.	We cd. tease them much more effectively with that.  And we shd. be correct in law.



P.M.	If it’s case tht. no large sum will be freed to E. w’out consultn. with Ty. and Cab. – includg. the £5 m. – I shd. feel much better than I did.

	Can. Ty. ensure tht. no sum larger than £1 m. will be transferred w’out Cab. authority.



R.A.B.	After S.P.A. expires, all in Ty. discretion : and Ty. authority to be asked by D/E. for any major operation.
