C.C. 71 (52)					22nd July, 1952



1.	    Wages Policy.



W.M.	Opposn may raise this in econ. debate vice 1/2 Supply Day.

	No power to make award retrospective to date on wh. I referred it back.  I am considerg. wtr. anything can be done on that.



P.M.	Keep us informed of developmts.



L.P.	Believe a wage increase is due to these. They include many of R.A.B.’s Achilles heel.  



W.M.	Employers in other indies look to us for a lead on gravity of econ. situation.  These employers mght. be persuaded to give pay retrospectively.





2.	    Iron &amp; Steel Bill.



P.M.	Prefer new draft of W. Paper.



Sal.	Majority take opp. view to myself.  On reflectn I’m ready to accept that view.  Statement (prepd in acc. with last decn) was worse fr. my angle than the W. Paper.  If Paper publd Govt. will be asked intns &amp; will have to state them.  Choice therefore is not betwn. W. Paper &amp; Statement.  It’s W’Paper &amp; Statement or statement alone.

	Like statement in M/S. memo.  But better make it in econ. debate not on publn of W. Paper.  Tho’ we are going on with Bill, sitn is so serious we are willing to discuss amendmts.



P.M.	Agree.  R.A.B. or I cd. work it in to speech.

	Publn of W. Paper, it’s hoped, will facilitate discns with Corpn.  Deeds wh. will ease atmosphere.



H.C.	Avoid promises re speed of passage next Session.  Heavy p’mme.

5 measures must be passed before Xmas.



D.S.	Publn.  Statement this wk. can announce publn.		     [Enter S. Lloyd

on Mon. next. 



P.M.	Settle date with Sw.  Announcemt. by H.C. on Thurs. next.



H.M.	Make it clear tht. our legn arises fr.

i)	Socialist Acts wh. broke down

ii)	Socialist delays.



H.C.	We shall be doing (ii) ourselves.



                                     		[Exit D.S.

3.	    Parliament.



S.Ll.	Form of motion for F.A. debate.  Handed round.



P.M.	Date – last 2 days because A.E.’s indisposition.



S.Ll.	Opposn are still arguing among themselves.  They will post units on suggesting deferment.



Sal.	Debate in H/L.



P.M.	 On Friday, if poss. 1/8.



H.C.	Is Friday 1/8 to be ordinary day in H/C.



P.M.	Why not be guided by views of House? 



H.C.	They wd. rather rise at 4.pm.  Might consider taking adjournmt. after 4.pm. on Fri.  F.O. will be satisfied with 11/2 days?



S.Ll.	Yes, in circs.



Sal.	Think we may have to do it on the Thursday.





4.	    Compensation for Part-Time Justices’ Clerks.



R.A.B.	Not a good moment – wages policy.

	Repercussions on 12 or so other Acts.  Wd. open door to other claims.

	Wiser therefore to p’pone.



M-F.	Diffy. is tht. Mag. Cts. Cttee are comg. into effect 1/4/53.  If part-time clerks aren’t compensated (600 out of 700) the Cttee will keep them on.  Whole benefit will be lost.

	Of the 12 Acts, 7 are not parallel because they deal with part-time compn excluded.

		2 aren’t because part-times have bn. absorbed.

		On remaining 3, argument as in memo. para. 5.  In 3 other Acts compensn is by product of legn with another main purpose.  Bill was passed on assumptn of compn.  Also (c).

	Need to improve efficiency of summary courts.  Ch.C.’s have given as one reason for crime increase the poor performance of the Cts.



Sw.	Comparison with wage restraint on lower-paid workers.  Not needed until Apl. ’53.  Why not take it up again in autumn.



P.M.	Not a good moment.  Wd. cancel out our saving on Ministers’ cars.



Sim.	Important for admn of justice to get max. no. of whole-time clerks.

Won’t get them unless part-timers are compensated.

Stress argument in para. 5 (b).

No doubt of justice of compensatg. these people.



Sal.	At least don’t decide against this in principle.



			Agreed. Defer decision until autumn (Oct or Nov.) 

			               soon after Parlt. re-assembles.

					[Exit Att.G.

					[Enter P.M.G.

5.	    Overseas Telegraph Rates.



P.M.G.	Revenue yield - £2m.



P.M.	An additional import on public.

	Wrongly natd by Socialists:  no doubt now costs more.  Let us rather show what a mistake this was, &amp; how much more it costs.

Ty. still makes a profit out of G.P.O. services as a whole.

V. large increases.



P.M.G.	Costs have risen by £21/2 m. fr. 1951 to 1953.

	No rise in rates since 1929.  What other service has such a record.

	Even at 1/- Transatlantic rate will be 41/2d less than U.S. rate in opp. direction.

	If we don’t raise rates, Ty. will have to pay.  Commd to fixed rate of interest on bonds.



R.A.B.	Support memo.

	But suggest no increase in Press rate.  



P.M.G.	I don’t now suggest that increase.



Ch.	Para. 8 will cost us $1m p.a.



P.M.G.	Shall be heavily pressed by U.S. if we don’t.  They wd. like an even heavier increase.  Can mitigate dollar loss by change in book-keeping arrangemts.



S.Ll.	Scandinavia 50%.  Belgium etc. only 331/3%.



P.M.G.	Sep. Scand. co., makg. a bigger loss:  they ask for this extra.

	Scheme agreed with all countries concerned save tht. U.S. wd. have liked even heavier increases.



P.M.	Let failure of natn appear first.



R.A.B.	We must make it pay.



P.M.	Will be an outcry.

P.M.G.	U.S. cos. have bn. doing 80% of the Transatlantic business and are operatg. at a loss because of rates we force them to charge.

	New cable coming in next year wd. increase our Transatlantic capacity by 15%.



R.A.B.	Let me examine the dollar aspects of this once more with P.M.G.

	If this were still a private co., rates wd. have bn. raised long since.

		Suggest we approve in principle.



		X/ { let me examine the dollar point.

     { p’pone announcement for a while

		

			Report X/ back to Cabinet.

				          [Exit P.M.G.



6.	    Korea.  Appointment of Deputy C.O.S.



P.M.	Ridiculous mouse, but A.E. still wants it.

	Parlt will scoff at this.  More respons. w’out any more power.

I won’t read it out.  F.O. must do it.  Or M/Def.



Al.	If public understand duties, won’t be confusion – and M. Clark wants it.  But if misunderstanding &amp; ill-feeling in U.S., then I wd. drop it.



O.L.	Too much of this altogether.  Confine it to t. of r.



Al.	Make if clear

i)	no more respons.

ii)	only one channel of commn to U.S.



S.Ll.	His presence will be helpful to our liaison offr. &amp; Amb. in Tokyo.



Sal.	Omit t. of r.



S.Ll.	A.E. wd. accept that.



			Amended draft approved.

			To be announced? in genl statement on Korea on Monday 	next.





7.	    “Japanese” Prisoners of War.



S.Ll.	As in memo.  £20 p. head for prs. in Jap. hands only.

	Feeling in H/C. and among the assocns of ex. prisoners.

	Unofficial means test.

	M/P. think it imposs. to distribute the money thro’ vol. organns.

 

P.M.	Br. Legion? 



S.Ll.	They wd. favour this.



P.T.	Who will handle the distn. 



S.Ll.	F/E. Assocn includes 90%.  Ty. will consider how to handle it, esp. the 10%.



P.T.	Hope B/T. won’t be asked to do it.



O.L.	Avoid suggn tht. this is compensn.  Only handing out what we have got.



R.A.B.	P.T. &amp; Nutting have said we shall do it the other way.

	The Vol. organns expect the money.

	Other claims will be re-opened – fr. Colonies etc.

	Unusual to give a grant to a p.o.w.  May come back at you in future.

Ty. will have to administer.  More official.

	Having exposed the diffies I support this unsound plan.



L.	Thousands of merchant seamen.  They now favour handing the money over to King Geo. Fund for Sailors.  Viz. the Labour Govt. plan.



R.A.B.	Promises given by P.T. &amp; Nutting.



Al.	This is more diff. than it looks.

	I started with prejudice in favour of Labour Scheme.  But the organisations are nervous about it, esp. distinction between Jap &amp; G. prisoners.

	Per capita. grant is easier, tho’ not necessarily better, system.



			Resume discussion at some later mtg.





8.	    Marshall Scholarships.



P.M.	Cost?



S.Ll.	£20.000 p.a. plus $10-15.000 p.a. indefinitely.



Ch.	Good in principle.  But unwise to do it differently from Rhodes Scholars.  Assimilate it as closely as poss. to Rhodes system – incldg. election – and give no more money.



H.C.	Certainly exclude married.  Want them to mix with others – in term &amp; vac.



Sim.	Adminve cost is v. high – will be heavily criticised.

	Rhodes Trust wd. do it for nothing.



		A.E. to consider { a) bachelors.

                                                            { b) grant no more than Rhodes Scholars.

			                  { c) selection to be handled by Rhodes Trusts.
