C.M. 83(52).				1st October, 1952.



				[Enter  Sw., Solr. Genl.

	1.	Budget:  Out-turn of Revenue &amp; Expenditure.



R.A.B.	Receipts less, &amp; expre greater, than assumed.

	Rise in expre by l.a.’s.  Am submittg. memo. on further control.

	Shall have to consider situation.



P.M.	Have there bn. such violent fluctuations previously?



R.A.B.	Probably not.  Am considering – will report.

	Speech 7/10 at Mansion House – will say this is now our main

		problem.  B/payments is better:  now this is worse.  Risk of

		renewed inflationary crisis.





	2.	Germany:  Krupp.



A.E.	Policy of Socialists &amp; U.S. was to break up the big combines.  Krupps

		has bn. broken up.  Krupp has now bn. given this money in 

		paymt. for his interest - £6 m.  G. money.

	He was acquitted as war criminal by U.S. revision of sentence.  Were

		we to say tht. because his name is Krupp he cdn’t be paid.



P.M.	Decision made by U.S. Govt. during late Govt. office.



A.E.	Krupp will pay some to employees - &amp; may be subject to tax.

	Wd welcome chance to make position clear in H/C.





	3.	Development Charge.



H.M.	Stand by memo.



Sal.	I am not personally interested.

	Are Tories in favour of private ownership of land or not.  Tendency

		lately to show nothing but hostility to land-owners.  Don’t

		think in terms of large estates.  We ought to give them all a

		square deal.  This doesn’t give it.

	Don’t oppose abolition of dev. charge:  only the inequity betwn. one

		owner &amp; another.



P.M.	Had read out P.M. Minute of Feb. ’44 on a Selborne memo.



H.M.	Accept that.  But propn then under discn was comp. purchase at ‘39

		prices of land in occupn.  All sales now will be at use value:

		only ques. is paymt. for developmt. potential.



Sal.	Land bought for investmt:  man doesn’t base action on use or future

		developmt.  He shd. be fully compensated if there is compuls.

		purchase.  For real value:  not 47 value.  Condns &amp; value of

		money may well change.



H.M.	My plan has bn. criticised as too favourable to land-owner because

		frees him.

	Under law now £300 m. will be paid.  Then all dev. value will be taken 

		from land-owner.  Claims total more than £300 m.  So they wd.

		get only about 80% of their claims.  But 87 by no. &amp; 57 by value

		under £1.000. &amp; v. many under £3.000 this wd. be spent not

		invested – hence inflationary.  You wd. be buying values wh.

		in v. many cases wd. never be developed – e.g. Lords.

	My plan:  pay only as &amp; when.  But more than 80%.

	Why shd. “free” sale be given 100% price?  Admit some inequity.

		But Sal.’s argument really ignores altogether theory tht. State

		shd. plan.  Right to do what you like with land has bn. limited.

		And we shall compensate him as much as he wd. have bn. under

		Act as now.  But we can’t pay full value – compensn wd. be so 

		high tht. planning wdn’t work.  That is why ’32 Act broke 

		down – compn for value tht. p. authy created.

	Housing.  The more I succeed the greater burden I put on State

		(subsidies).  Vital therefore to revive private bldg.  Diff:  pre-war

		spurt was due to low industl bldg.  Not easy to get them in now.

		Controlled rents so low:  money costs much:  and dev. charge

		as well.

	My plan is a compromise.



Sal.	These figures show wide distn of land-holding.  Wd affect v. many.

	Quite accept non-paymt. of £300 m.  My sole diffy is the differentn

		betwn. one owner &amp; another acc. to wtr. he sells privately or

		under comp. purchase.  And the gap will widen as years pass.

	What about my para. 3.  Current Market value for all sales &amp;

		arbitration.



H.M.	All turns on “current market value”.  Land selling now well above

		value w’out developmt.

	Benefit of public planning (e.g. land near a new town) wd. go to the

		private owner.  The arbitrator wd. give the enhanced value.



L.P.	Two problems.  i)  Are we to abandon developmt. charge?  The Act

		has broken down.  At 60% cost of adminn wd. be    [Enter  D.S.

		heavy.  Subsequent Govts. cd. raise it to 80% or 100%.

	

	Against Dev. Charge.  Ch., L., Sim., O.L., W., Al., P.T., Sol.G., M.B.,

		H.C., J.S.



M-F.	Some part of devel. value is due to public improvemt;  &amp; owners shd.

		make some contribn.  I favoured 40%.  But told it’s

		impracticable.  Answer to Sal. is to make owner who gets private

		sale pay some charge.

A.E.	Support M-F.  But don’t know how it can be done.



W.M.	What about para. 9. of memo.



P.T.	Turns on compensn.



Sal.	I shared M-F.’s view, but have bn. pushed out of it by argument tht.

		Soc. wd. or cd. put it up to 100% w’out having had the £300 m.



R.A.B.	Agree with M-F.  Can find no tax as equitable as dev. charge.  Sales

		tax on land wd. involve us in cap. gains tax.  Nor wd. it be 

		confined to developmt value, but to whole price.

	Thus, if equity is to be kept, must have some charge.  Weakness of

		H.M.’s posn is tht. he is retaing. part of existg. Act – planning

		and compensn.  Sal.’s scheme may involve v. heavy compn on

		comp. purchase, falling on Exchequer.

	This is odious subject.  No agreemt. in Coalition Govt.  Don’t want

		same trouble again.  Don’t want to pay £300 m.

	Cd we not say – reduce dev. charge:  this isn’t final Act:  may get

		a better scheme next year.



H.C.	But existg. scheme doesn’t work.

	Sales tax cd. be considered – in framework of planning – need not

		therefore have consequences re cap. gains tax.



Sw.	Favour M-F. view.  Dev. charge not wrong per se but falls on wrong

		man viz., the developer.  Why not make dev. charge payable by

		land-owner when he sells above use value and assessed claim?



J.S.	There wdn’t be any developmt. on that basis.



H.M.	cf. 10(b) of my memo.



R.A.B.	Spoke in support of Sal. memo.



A.E.	How avoid that?



R.A.B.	Either increase compn (Sal.) – too expensive.

	or	Keep dev. charge         – Cab. dislike this.



H.M.	Tax will always be paid by final purchaser.	{  Price will be made to

	But see 10(b).	{  include tax.



P.M.	First principle:  don’t penalise a developer.



M.B.	10(b) wdn’t make people more ready to sell.



P.M.	Yes:  more sense in a non-developmt. charge.



M.B.	Sales of land for estate duty – wd. be doubly taxed.

P.M.	Let (? Minister) set out 4 or 5 general principles which

			we cd. defend.     Or  ?  Cttee.





	4.	Rent Control.



P.M.	Shd. not approach this from angle of landlord – or indeed tenant.

		We must base it on the house.  Let Govt. restore the

		“wounded” houses to take part in the battle.

	Quoted fr. Labour Party “Welfare State”.

	Suppose you allow l’lord. to raise rent so long as he spends all on

		repair &amp; gets no added profit.  See that he gets no more out

		of it, but allow him to put up rents, w’in limits, to extent

		of repairs done.



H.M.	Preserve national asset.  Must therefore either buy or enable l’lord to

		repair.

	Base it on the state of the house – to avoid giving no benefit to the

		l’lord who has, at a loss, kept his property in reasonable repair.



A.E.	Support this plan.

	Do it early, rather than late.



R.A.B.	Approve in principle.

	But don’t want “slum clearance” nos. to be added to “target”

		260.000.



H.M.	We are now in posn to remove requiremt. of licence for bldg.

		altogether.  Will help to get private bldg. moving.  Rest only

		on planning permission.



H.C.	{ Approve in principle:  L.P.’s Cttee to examine details.

	{ Proceed with prepn of a Bill as soon as possible.





	5.	Communist on Advisory Council.



W.M.	Quite difft. from Arbn Tribunals.  On Adv. Cttee we have accepted

		them.

	Support M/S.



			Approved.



				      [Enter  de L’l., G.Ll.

	6.	Duke of Edinburgh:  Proposal to Learn Flying.



de L’l.	Elementary civil flying only.  No more is proposed at this stage.

	Late King earned his wings, in last war but one.  Also Windsor,

		also Gloucester &amp; Kent.  The last 3 did solo tests, with

		instructor there but not active.

Ch.	Shd not ever be allowed to fly the Queen.



H.C.	Advise against it.  What point in it?



O.L.	This is 1952.  Flying is a normal part of life.



de L’l.	Wd be gt. disappointmt to him &amp; to R.A.F.



Sal.	I am against his learning to fly.

	

	In favour:  R.A.B., J.S. (rules re Queen later), M-F., L.P., Alex.,

			P.T., W.M.



P.M.	I will bring it up again.

				[Exit  Solr.G.



	7.	Coronation:  Naval Review.



P.M.	M’batten says it cd. be done w’out addl cost – save for fireworks

		and charter of liner.

	Shall we ask what Admy can do w’out addl expense.

	R.A.F. Fly-past cd. be allowed w’out extra cost.

			I must give some hope at Balmoral.

				       [Exit  de L’l.



	8.	Petrol:  Brands.



G.Ll.	Ty. have agreed.  Only ques. is timing.  Awkward while C.E.C. 

		Officials are here because we can’t supply this good petrol

		to Doms.



R.A.B.	And also announcg. extra burden on our b/p. when they are here.

		About £400.000.



G.Ll.	Before Tory Conference.  Freedom.

			

			Agreed:   Do it early.  But consult C.R.O. about

			                informing Dom. officials.
