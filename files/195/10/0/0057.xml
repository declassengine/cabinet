C.C. 43(52)							16th April 1952



		1.	Germany.			[Enter Sw., B-H. and Maclay



A.E.	We shd. go on with our 2 – E.D.C. and contractual arrangements.

	In reply to Sov. note, we shd. not close door to 4 Power discussions.  Wd. play into their hands if we did.  Want 2 Treaties signed soon after our reply – then 4 Power cd. follow.



	Pressed this view on U.S. today.



P.M.	Can’t let it collapse on diffies. betwn. 4 Power and U.N. supervision of elections.

	We shd. dep. 3-1 on a 4 Power commn.  It’s what we asked for in war on Gk. elections.



A.E.	Prob. only a manoeuvre to delay the 2 agreemts.  So long as we see it does no harm in going fwd.



P.M.	Must ensure tht. U.S. come in fully.  



A.E. 	They are, on N.A.T.O.; and our guarantee is to last no longer than N.A.T.O.





		2.	Egypt.



A.E.	Conversations opened with Amb.  He welcomes return of Stevenson and Howe.

	Propose to do that.

	Internal posn. in E. is not bad : Wafd are quarrelling and may split.

	This means less need for hurry.  Elections put off.



P.M.	If we leave E., we must get some of the base stocks back to U.K.

	L. cd. produce shipping.





		3.	Tunisia : Admission of Nationalist Leaders to U.K..



A.E.	2 Nat. leaders from Tunisia want to come here.  French won’t like it at all.

	One alleged to have bn. tried and condemned to death in 1946 for collaboratg. with Nazis.  Trying to get evce. of that.



M-F.	Nothing v. them individually.  Traditional policy to let such people in, unless they intended to engage in pol. activities here or were personally repugnant to p. opinion.



A.E.	They are not coming as pol. refugees claiming asylum, but to use this country as a base for conductg. anti French propaganda.

P.M.	M’tain right of asylum, but investigate their claims v. carefully.



A.E.	Labour Govt. held them back twice.



P.M.	Try to stop it, by every means of delay.





		4.	Railway Fares.



L.	Asked if we meant to adjust the Ldn. posn.  I said we intended to do so.  Added that it wd. take a little time.  This at a Press Conference today, with Lobby correspondents.



P.M.	Keeping way open to launch a large scheme.  But clear tht. rlways must have some more money from one source or another, before long.



L.	Yes.  Need we wait.  W’in 10/14 days we must make a repn.                     to Consultve Cttee. who are likely to repeat recommns. they made on Ldn.

	We must try to arrange with B.T.C. who may be accommodating, about fares.  We mght. try to get agreemt. with them first.  They need not go to maximum permitted under Tribunal’s award.  This wd. also keep B.T.C. co-opn.



P.M.	Next step shd. be W. Paper – showg. a wide policy.  



L. 	On transport as a whole, but not directly affectg. passenger fares.



Sw.	We hope Press will run the line that humanity is better than logic.



L.	No retrospection in any Ldn. adjustment.



R.A.B.	Don’t like introdn. of decreases (£1¼ m) while increases are deferred.

	Rlways will have severe deficit if this continues.

	Tho’ I agree tht. logic went too far and Govt. were right to protect public from inhumanity of the machine.

	Want sense of reality in our national economy.



P.M.	Try to carry B.T.C. with you : but, if you can’t, that’s where they get off.



Sim.	That wd. involve v. drastic action.



M-F.	Direction under s.4 might serve.



W.M.	Or change personnel of B.T.C.



Macl.	Shall be asked in H/C. i) when I’m to refer to Cons. Cttee.

				ii) what will be done in Ldn.



Sw.	Answer to ii) is to apply to Ldn. whatever solution we find for Provinces.



Macl.	Appearance of artificial aid to rlways cd. set loose wage demands.





		5.	Parliament.



P.M.	Shd. motion re time-table cover both Bills?



R.A.B.	Bit steep to do this on Fin. Bill w’out any prev. discn. with Opposn.

	Wd. prefer to put in on Tues. time-table on N.H. Bill.  Then, after warning by H.C., I will discuss with Opposn. time-table for my Bill.

	If I can’t get agreemt., we will submit compuls. t-table at end/week.



B-H.	H.C. has agreed not to put both Bills in motion.

	He doubts, however, wthr. we shd. take the motion w’out opportunity for Opposn. to table amendments.  Wants to give one days’ grace for that.



P.M.	Keep Fin. Bill out of this political row.  



B-H. 	Better for H.C. not to mention in context of this row, need for [agreed if possible] time-table for F. Bill.



B-H.	Byng &amp; Co. intend to obstruct on smaller Bills too, which can’t be subject to separate time-table motion.





		6.	The Coronation.



P.M.	a) The Date.  Queen prefers 2/6/53.

	b) The Cost.  Cab. Cttee.  L.P.S., H.O., Ch/Ex., M/W.  R.A.B. may be repd by another Minister.  Seek the mean betwn. extravagance and mingy economy.
