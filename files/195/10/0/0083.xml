C.C. 70 (52)					17th July, 1952



1.	    Parliament.

			                                                          [Enter Sw., B.H., D.E.

	a) H/Lords Debate on Powers of Entry



P.M.	Referred to R.A.B.’s answer to P.Q. on 15/7.  Not bad.  (P.Q. by F. Maclean



Sal.	Llewellin’s point – no entry w’out warrant on private dwelling – has some merit.   



P.M.	Justices’ warrant shd. be required – traditional.



Sw.	H/L. accept need to enter w’out Justices’ warrant into private house.





2.	    Emil Fuchs.



P.M.	Read further minute from H. Secy.  F. moved to Leipzig in Oct. ’49.

Son arrested in Feb. ’50.  Known for years as anti-Nazi Quaker.

	Recommend tht. F. shd. come, but shd. not be allowed to see his son.



Sal.     }	Sooner he didn’t come

Ch.      }

O.L.    }



P.M.	H.O. to consider means of preventing F. from coming here.





1.	    Parliament. (resumed)



	(b)



H.C.	Business for next week.

	All Supply Days; save Mon &amp; Frid – when time-table motion on Licensing in New Towns Bill will be taken .

	Shall be asked if any Statement on Korea is to be made before recess.



P.M.	Short statement cd. be made.



Al.	V. little to say save on bombing &amp; don’t want to enlarge on that.



P.M.	Cd. get round that w’out special emphasis or details.



H.C.	Then I can promise one. – a brief statement.



P.M.	Recess:  Why not announce all dates, incldg. new Session.



H.C.	Wd. sooner keep that until next week.  Shall to-day announce hope to rise before Bk. Hol. but may mean sitting on the Saty.

				                 [Exit B-H.

					   [Enter D.S. S.Ll.

3.	    Investment Programme.



R.A.B.	At £900m. there is still a gap of £87m. after screening.

	Money totals only a guide – but we must have a guide if we are to avoid starting more than we can finish.

	More for production industry - £100m.  Means bringing Defence down to £110m.  Only remaining cut wh. can be made is housing – w’out wh. the balance must be distributed among others.  H.M. wants £416m.  I suggest £372 m. – a diffce of £44m.  With smaller houses &amp; ingenuity, he might still reach his target of nos.



P.M.	But you may stop expanding productivity of bldg. industry.  Fear of wrkg. themselves out of jobs.



R.A.B.	There are 55.000 houses tenders to be appd. if he is to reach 260.000.

		Slowing down approvals wd. meet me.  We haven’t announced publicly 260.000 target.  Bring approvals down to 25.000 quietly and we shd. do the trick.  Recognise difficulty of public statements.



P.M.	This is only remaining credit of Tory Party.

	Good effect on exports too, &amp; munitions, now tht. special workers’ houses.



Ch.	Each house uses £300 of imported materials.  We cd. give more meat to everyone if we gave less houses to some.  We are best-housed and worst fed nation in W. Europe.



P.M.	Housing achievemt. is all we can say in reply to torrent of abuse.



R.A.B.	Can’t afford more than £900m. for bldg.  If housing stands untouched, all civil p’mmes must be cut.  Unrealistic.



Al.	Ready to surrender £13m. on Service Dpts. = 15% cut.

	M/S. is not ready to make a similar contn.



H.M.	Two measurements.  

			a) Money.  Conventt but risky.  What was money output in 1st 6 mos. as cpd. with estimate.  Houses: 111.000 as cpd  92,000 in corr. period of prev. year.  Estimate given to Lab. Govt has bn falsified.

	£1.600m. is estimate of total output, incldg. m’tenance.  Gap is only 5% of that, or 10% of new bldg.  Can easily close this by productivity.

			b) Materials.  Suggd 332.000 st. vice 

	Gap of 64.000 st. = about £41/2m.  Timber price has fallen to £60 a standard f.o.b.  Can’t stop the machine:  can’t get much new design into ’53.  Mght. save 20.000 st. or £11/4m. by that means in ’53.  But in ’54, gap of 106.000 st. cd. be closed as to 97.000 st. by new design, reckoning, on 300.000 built.

	In May 2/3rds of starts were the smaller houses - &amp; more as year goes on.

	If I delay approvals, news will leak &amp; tempo will be lost.

	To keep all flowing wd. cost £41/2m. in imported materials of wh. I wd. hope to save £11/4 m.  In Dec. we cd. decide wtr. 1954 shd. come below 300.000.



D.E.	Bldg. industry has got into its stride &amp; if we check it we shall undermine confidce &amp; productivity.  But accept need to limit imported materials. My recommns wd. keep expansion going w’out further strain on b/p.

	Want to say we are shifting emphasis to production industry.  Wd. cut even more off Govt. Dpts. &amp; give it to industry.  E.g. bad to go on with ban on bldg. in Ldn. (City)

	Can keep momentum going with minimum use of imports.

But must be allowed to expand capacity for home productn of materials.



D.S.	Steel.  Home prodn shd. be ½ m tons of finished up in ’53.  And more from U.S. if we are ready to buy it.



O.L.	Money is only a guide.  E.g. if £900 m limit &amp; extra ???? p. day were worked you wd. exceed ceiling by £25m.  The more industry works, the more Dept. will be punished.

	Materials (imported) is only thing to rely upon.



Ch.	Say:  no more materials than last year &amp; let him do what he can.



O.L.	Figures aren’t capable of this nicety – not suff. reliable.



Sw.	Massey Harris – 2 factories here.  Tractors &amp; harvesters are being refused in Eur. therefore buyers haven’t sterling to pay for them.  E.g. Finns. because we aren’t buying their timber.  Turks because tobacco.  Illustrates direct link cutting back imports too far means sell our exports.



R.A.B.	Ty. will adapt money criterion over next year – it’s not satisfy.

	Other Dpts. are holding back their investment.  Housing alone is free.

If it’s left wholly free, other Dpts. will break away.



P.M.	Don’t destroy good spirit that is in bldg. trade.

	Cut Govt. bldg., - even defence works.  But don’t accept need to modify our housg. p’mme to wh. we are deeply commd. &amp; is our only success.  There is good reason to make exception for this.



L.P.	No one can estimate precisely out put of bldg. industry a year ahead.

	The only safe criterion is use of imported materials.



R.A.B.	30.000 homes wd. give £20m. on b/p. – if resources were put into exports.

                    [	What are we to say in debate?  Expectns aroused by statements y’day.

            *      [	May I discuss with M/H and M/W. means of phrasing announcement

                    [   in terms of use of imported materials.



P.M.	Discourage b. industry now &amp; you’ll never get them going again.



R.A.B.	Will leave decn over until next week.



D.S.	Welcome that because must relate my views to new costing &amp; new p’mme.

Must see what bldg. is needed for new prodn p’mme.



R.A.B.	Revision of other p’mmes will be needed – more sacrifices fr. others if we are to say more resources are going into bldg. for production industry.  Our exports are dropping:  we must get them up.

Housing doesn’t increase our exports.  And unless we increase them we can’t live.



P.T.	We are trying to build houses acc. to pledge:  def. p’mme: and increase exports.  Can’t do it all.  Either def. or housing must be cut back.



H.M.	On £1.6000 m total for bldg. indy. - labour content can be expanded by greater effort.  That cd. cover gap of 5% or 10%.



Sw.	Amount of materials needed, with econ. measures, is not too diff.

Flats e.g. use more steel p. person housed than houses - &amp; H.M. is going to build us more.



H.M.	25.000 t. of steel on present p’mme – cd. prs. be reduced to 15 or 20.000.



D.S.              [	Special houses for workers needed to expand exports – on lines done

                     [	 for miners etc., &amp; def. prodn.  Can this be considered.

                 *  [	Wd. make housg. contribute to exports.    

                     [

W.M.            [	 Support that.



H.M.             [	Ready to look into that.



P.M.	Now, I wd. put housing above defence (anyway in men).



R.A.B.	Statement at end/month is likely to damage credit of Govt. unless more teeth can be put into it.



P.T.	We are not makg. a sufft. switch to exports.  Can’t say we are.

	Diffies in sale:  but with more steel, &amp; capacity we cd. sell more.

We are losing orders because we can’t give early delivery dates because lack of steel.



D.E.	May I push output of home-produced bldg. materials – e.g. more cement, to save structural steel.  People won’t adopt new methods unless assured of alternative materials.  £2m. on my cap. investmt wd. suffice for substitute materials.  



Sw.	Support that v. strongly – from angle of steel allocations.  



Ch.	Double shifting wd. avoid creation of new capacity.



P.M	Give one more year in wh. economies &amp; home-made devices can come into effect.  Boneless wonder &amp; single saver.



R.A.B.        [	Cab. rejects both methods of control – both price mechanism and

                   [   physical controls – in circs. when country is clearly trying to do too 

                   [   much.



P.T.           }	Support that view.  Exports are dropping because we are trying to do

D.E.           }    too much.



D.S.	And need is to give more steel to firms wh. can sell exports.  Shall now discriminate on that basis.



O.L.	Taking a/c of conversion factor of metal use.



Ch.	E.g. £400 p ton for steel in motor car.



R.A.B.	We have given M/W. all he asked for.



D.E.	Now find I need more.



 R.A.B.    	Final decisions next week.

               	M’while will discuss with M/H and M/W formula related to resources.

						  [Exit D.E.

					          [Enter G.Ll.

4.	    Colonial Development.



O.L.	Read statement.  Will help.



R.A.B.	I agree.





5.	    Schuman Plan.



S.Ll.	As in memo.



Sal.	No mention or C.R.O.  Wd. like to be kept in touch.



R.A.B.	Cd. A.E. delegate some of economic work to Ty.



S.Ll.	Contemplates w. parties.

					[Exit G.Ll. &amp; D.S.



6.	    Chinese Aircraft in Hong Kong.



O.L.	May I be told when R. Council will pronounce judgemt., so that I may alert Police etc.



W.M.	I cd. find out unofficially – I did the case in H. Kong., can ask Shawcross how it’s likely to go.



P.M.	Stop them leaving H. Kong.



S.Ll.	If U.S. win &amp; want to send the aircraft to Formosa….



P.M.	I will ask them not to do so.  Wd. put that to Truman, if need be.



R.A.B.	Protect aircraft to avoid claim for compensn fr. U.S., if they win.





7.	    Coronation: India.



Sal.	Ask him – in neutral terms.  If he says no; we wd. have him in Procession &amp; a stand for India.



P.M.	Wd. like Indian troops to be there.



Sal.	Wdn’t discourage them if they wanted to.



P.M.	Good feeling in Indian Army – wd. be a good thing to have them here.





8.	    New Hotel in London.



P.T.	Pol. diffies  

a.	Housing.  Effect will be marginal.

b.	Mayfair.  If it turned into offices. that wd. be an argument for bldg. this.



O.L.	Absurdity of central Govt. control.  We shd. have examd all claims – sure to be an industrialist who cd. earn more dollars for £2m.



H.C.	16 floors high – horrid.



P.T.	14 actually.



H.M.	Awkward timing , if cut in housing announced same day.

P.T.	Let me have decision in principle &amp; settle timing with M/H.



P.M.	Do it in recess.





9.	    Cost of Living.



W.M.	3 points up in July.  Tea etc.  Savings in clothing etc., offset by increased fares.

	Likely to be publd next week – before Wed. next.



Sw.	See that it is explained.



R.A.B.	We said it might be 4-5 points.
