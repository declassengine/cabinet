C.C. 32(52)							20th March 1952



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter Sw., B.H.



H.C.	Business for next week.





		2.	National Health Service Bill.



H.C.	Three amendments suggested.  Cost about £1½ m.  Ty. agree.

	Hearing aids – charge mght be imposed later.

	Shall I announce these at once on 2nd Rdg.?



Sw.	Yes : valuable qua publicity to seize initiative.



P.M.	Agree.  Good to make minor concessions to Parly. feeling, when it reflects public money.

	Our aim was not economy for its own sake, but to check waste.



H.C.	May I inform N.I. at once.	Agreed.



							[Exit B-H.

		3.	Steel.					[Enter D.S. &amp; M-Buller.



H.C.	Bill now ready for approval in principle – subject to minor changes.



D.S.	Assets to be transferred to a Realisn Agency respons. for returng. them to private enterprise as quickly as may be.  In agency clauses have provided for leasing assets (via selling) which can’t readily be sold : this wd. involve less capital.



	Supervision : Bd. on lines of old Bd. with increased powers.  Prices, with over-riding powers to M/Supply.  Development : includes Govt. positive action. T. Unionists individually carried on this scheme : but not T.U.C. as a body.



P.M.	Positive powers on developmt.  Wise to restrict Govt. intervention to what is needed for defence.



D.S.	Want also to cover development in distressed area wh. mght not be fully economic.



P.M.	Suggest Ministers send written comments to Cttee : and any outstandg. points can then be brght. to Cabinet.

	We can today only consider ques. of principle.



R.A.B.	Cab. shdn’t think any substantial part of assets will be saleable.

	Oppn. threats will deter buyers.  And no guarantee clause if practicable.

	M’while Ty. will be in unprecedented posn. of interestg. itself in divided policy and long term development.  Bank however think that unless Ty. so acts no other agency cd.  Dislike this role, esp. before P.A.C. v. embarrassing.



D.S.	Hoped Agency wd. do little more than dispose assets – leaving cos. to function as independently as possible.



	Cttee. met this am. and decided to revert to 2 lists of activities of Bd.

	i) basic activities wh. are clear  ii) fringe industries, wh. are in doubt. Bd. wd. take over i) at once : those in ii) wd. be a matter of negotn. followed by orders subject to Parly. approval.



P.M.	Give 2 weeks for comment.  Then to Cabinet again



R.A.B.	Prospects of sale wd. improve if we won next Election.



P.M.	Or earlier.  For Bill meets genuine Labour apprehensions – atmosphere may change after Act has passed.



H.C.	We shall have done our best and carried out our pledge.



Sw.	Private investor won’t take these up.  But 80% was held previously by companies eg. Vickers.



O.L.	Long business.  But not so pessimistic.  Re-capitalisation wd. help.

	Make it clear tht. this is a long process.

							[Exit M-B. &amp; D.S.

	

		4.	Financial Situation.



R.A.B.	Only about $100 m, above devaln level.

	March figures can be presented w’out gt. shock because what was said in Budget.  Posn. can be held therefore a bit longer.

	E.P.U. may improve because cuts made.  I may have to go to O.E.E.C. mtg. next week.

	On fwd. exchange £1 is holding up well.  Budget appd. by for. banks.

	By Apl/May it will be below $1.500 m.  Some emergency action may be needed.

	Trade pattern improved by cuts.

	St. area acting, as Austr. shows.  More gold from S.A.

	If we cd. have acted in Sept., we shd. have bn. in time.



P.M.	Urged to b’cast on 31/3.  Will decide tomorrow.  Some broad statements cd. be made – steadied out even in 20 wks.

	Get across some major points.

	No threat of reversing pol. decns. by industrial action.  Attitude of T.U.’s is encouraging.



L.P.	Hope P.M. will b’cast.



R.A.B.	Tewson has told me he realises we had to cut food subsidies because of posn. of £.



W.M.	He also wants to handle wage claims individually vice generally..



O.L.	Danger = trade recession.  To become solvent s. area has to be restrictionist.  We want capital movemts. to compensate for that.  U.S. ought to be liberal on rubber and tin.



Ch.	Try to concert buying policy with U.S. – drops in their imports are always followed by U.K. crisis.

	Hope R.A.B. will go to W’ton on this.

							[Enter Ll.G. and T.Dugd.



		5.	Farm Prices Review.



T.D.	May come to point of fixing prices w’out farmers’ agreement.

	We aim at £42½ m.– 45 m. increase.  Farmers claim £60 m.

	Farmers’ leaders may not be able to carry followers in an agreemt.

	If there is a break, we cdn’t impose measures to increase efficiency.

	Crunch will come in next week.

	Goes back to last year, when they were under-compensated and angry with leaders for accepting decisions.



J.S.	Narrow time limit.  For prices must be announced on 1/4.



T.D.	We shd. like to give less for cereals (but can’t because M/F. requirements) and this leaves us with not enough to compensate small men.  Old problem : can’t compensate small w’out giving too much to the large.

	Pl. subsidy is going well.  Shd. get increase of ½m. acres as result.

	Must have Cab. support if I am to break.

	Big item is £10 m. for calf subsidy as cpd. £5 m. of our plan.  This mght yield another 400.000 calves by ‘55/6 = 110.000 t. eventually of meat.

	Farmers say we won’t get it w’out big bribe at outset.



Ch.	That = ⅔rds of Argentine imports.



R.A.B.	Farmers ask 2d. p. g. on milk.  £80 m. subsidy already.

	Meat : wd. mean increasg. retail price.  Ready to consider other means.  900.000 t. of our supply is U.K.



J.S.	Want to shift emphasis from milk to meat, if we can.

	In Engl. small men depend on milk, unhappily.  



T.D. 	Also want to persuade them to keep on bull calves vice killing them.



T.D.	Since 1951 review prodn. has turned downwards because of lack of confidence due to disappmt on milk and egg prices awarded.

W.	Can’t bridge that gap by negotiation.



T.D.	Warning only today.



R.A.B.	£53 m. is real increase in costs.  Another £7-13 m. for incentive to prodn. is v. large.  If they got this, they wd. alienate public opinion.





		6.	Food Production : Pigs and Potatoes.



T.D.	Over 4 m. pigs.  Now level with pre-war.



P.M.	But 2 m. more people.



O.L.	Extraction rate lower [to give more animal feed.]?  Is it too high?

	Causing waste.



T.D.	417.000 t. pig meat in ’52.  Another 193.000 t. by ‘55/6.  Wd. give over 600.000 t.



P.M.	Potatoes.  V. dirty, I hear.



T.D.	Worried about next year because too many now.  Glut or shortage depends on yield and this year there is a glut.  Therefore they won’t plant so much next year.  Fear also of labour shortage to lift crop.



W.	Launch publicity campaign – eat potatoes to save the £.





		7.	Meat Supplies.



P.M.	Let Ty. consider this against my assurance of cuts in Admy. oil. and steel for Service huts.



Ll.G.	300.000 t. available 1952/3.  (June) in S. America.  Price : my guess is £175 p. ton.  = £50 m. for all 300.000.
