		1.	Europe : Germany etc.



A.E.	Long discn. on reslns on manufacture.  Acheson helpful.  Believe we have now reached this.  G. i) willing to put into Treaty agreemt. not to make anything not appd. by E.D.C.  ii) Willing to make sep. decln. re other things.  Civil aviation : neither means nor desire to make.

P.M.	In negotns. keep back somethg. to give away.



A.E.	First amendment  Para.(1).



P.M.	Para.(4) amendmt.  How will you defend our property with civilians only?



A.E.	Do we want agreemt. with a friendly Egypt?



P.M.	What if we w’draw and Wafd Govt. comes in?



P.T.	Art. 6 of 4 Power is more favourable, since it contemplates an allocn. of B. troops to remain.  



A.E. 	Only with agreemt. of E. Govt.  



P.T. 	But original agreemt. is not subject to constant modificn. by E. Govt.

	Put a covering instn on this.  This is maximum.  Don’t open it all at the outset.  Refer back and report outcome of 1st conversns. before you lay it out.  This = our thght.  Don’t do it now.

	Don’t go beyond I-III of earlier memo.  Tell us 1st how yr first conversn. goes.  None of this will be given to E. at outset.



P.M.	Give him draft A. as what we wd. like.
