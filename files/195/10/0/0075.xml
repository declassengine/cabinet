C.C. 62(52).				24th June, 1952.



	1.	Tanganyika:  Constitution.                   [Enter  B-H., Sw., P.M.G.



O.L.	Offl. majority will be preserved – no. of unofficials being increased.

	Increases unoffl fr. 14 to 21 but 22 officials.

	70.000 Asians, mostly Muslims.  18.000 Europeans, only 3.000

		settlers and bare majority of settlers are Brit. – mainly Gks.

		7½ m. Africans.

	Europeans won’t like this:  Asians will.

	Criticism will come fr. certain sections of white settlers.

	Based on recommns of Constitl Developmt. Cttee.

			

			Approved.



				[Enter  Ll.G. and T.D.

	2.	Slaughter of Horses.



P.M.	Read draft answer.

	Cpd. it with announcemt. in to-day’s Times.

	Feeling in H/C. was v. intense when this was raised the other day.

		This answer will raise a storm.

	Why not offer another enquiry if there is strong feeling.

	Much horse-meat now eaten after 6 yrs. of Socialist rule:  black

		market.



M-F.	Read alternative draft wh. he had prepd at P.M.’s request.

		Reflects P.M. directions in wtr. all functions shd. be centred in

		one Dpt. &amp; on wtr. further enquiry shd. be held.



P.M.	Prefer to announce decn tht. there shd. be another enquiry.

		Feel bound to have one.



Sim.	Agree – Genl. support for new enquiry.  M/Ag. &amp; M/F. in particular

		agreed.



Ll.G.	I cd. make immediate order requiring anyone about to slaughter a

		horse to notify l.a.            Agreed:  Do this and announce it in

		reply to P.Q.  Announce decn to hold further immedte enquiry to

		see wtr. rept. of Rosebury  Cttee  needs to be supplemented &amp;

		brght. up to date.

				[Exit  T.D.



	3.	P.O. Staff Associations.



W.M.	Support statement.

	Feeling on both sides:  the big Unions wdn’t wish Minister to have

		power of decision.



P.M.	Party not bound by what was said in debate, only by what was 

	written in Manifesto.



R.A.B.	Ty. practice since ’49 – on basis of wh. I have w’drawn recognn

		from Women’s Union.  Any departure from Listowel	[Enter  J.S.

		formula (recognn by nos.) wd. be contrary to Ty. practice.



W.M.	Real ques. is not numbers.  Strong union can deal with stupid claims &amp;

		suppress them.  If splinter Unions are recognised big ones will

		have to put fwd. stupid claims, to hold their own.



Sal.	3rd &amp; 4th sentences beg the ques:  will enrage Tories:  omit them.



R.A.B.	Prefer Ty. practice &amp; Listowel formula – recognise 40%.



P.M.G.	Ty. have always refused to accept fixed percentage.  Listowel formula

		didn’t guarantee recognn at 40% - only tht. it wdn’t be considered

		below 40%.

	Wiser to give time to allow the parties to come together.



P.M.	Read lr. from W. J. Brown.



R.A.B.	Ty. practice is contrary to N. Edwards and to de la Warr.



P.M.G.	Ty. disagreed with Listowel’s attempt to fix 40%.  But his formula

		has never bn. operated, in G.P.O.



P.M.	What urgency?  We must thrash this out.

	3rd &amp; 4th sentences wd. be v. welcome to T.U.C.



W.M.	Don’t object to their omission.

	Real problem:  T.U.C. attach undue importance to E.D.T.A. because

		they regard it as test for all splinter Unions.  I must retain good

		will of big Unions over coming months.



P.M.G.	I cdn’t run G.P.O. v. interests &amp; demands of staff.  If I recognised

		E.I.T.A. I shd. have go-slow.



W.M.	T.U.C. wd. welcome this statement.



M-F.	I accept the P.M.G.’s position.



H.C.	Shall we be better off in 6 mos.’ time?



P.M.G.	Not impossible to get a settlement.



B.H.	Does W.M. think this will satisfy the Tories.



W.M.	They wd. accept 6 mos.’ delay, not 12 – tho’ they won’t like it.



P.M.	General opinion favours P.M.G.’s proposal.

	 {I attach greatest weight to W.M.’s view on T.U.C. reaction

	 {wh. is vitally important to Ty. as well as Govt. generally.

	Agreed:   approve statement subject to omission of 3rd &amp; 4th sentces.	

					

					[Exit  P.M.G.

	4.	Irish Meat.



R.A.B.	I want 20% to go to dollar area.  Others only 10%.  Amounts to £3 m.

		B/Paymts. shd. come first.  Eire doing well on this:  rough 

		Budget.  Good psych. effect.



Ch.	They get v. high prices.



Ll.G.	We shd. get double if we exported ours.



Ll.G.	Sendg. meat fr. yr. doorstep to U.S.  Replace by non-sterling.

	Traditional market:  stores from Eire.  Rapid increase in fat cattle

		exports.  If we encourage this, cd. we prevent N.Z. etc. going into

		higher price U.S. market.  Irish exports to U.S. mght. develop.



Sal.	Shd regret diverting Irish meat.  They mght. get a habit of not feeding

		U.K. market.  Dangerous.



L.P.	If we must keep up meat supply, we shd. have to replace fr. dollar or

		equivalent sources.



Ch.	Keep our imports fr. Eire level, &amp; let them export any surplus to U.S.



P.M.	Larger measures mght. be less painful.



R.A.B.	I wd. not agree to replacement.



Ll.G.	M/Ag. attaches gt. importce to stores.



			Agreed – against R.A.B.	[Exit  Ll.G.

				[Enter  Nutting.



	5.	Korea.   Parliamentary Statement.



N.	Statement by M/State.  Now proposed for Tues. of next week.



P.M.	This wd. be more helpful to M/D.



Sw.	Argument for Thurs. is to stop speculn over wk-end.  That is

		outweighed.  But announce on Thurs. tht. it will be made on

		followg. Tues.



N.	Dep. C.O.S (Br.) may have bn. settled with Acheson by then.



P.M.	Shd. he answer P.Q.’s in advance?  Better ask H/C. to await his 

		genl. statement.



N.	A.E. thght. H/C. wdn’t wait for any answer to P.Q.’s until Tuesd.

		Good answers tht. can be given in reply to these P.Q.’s.

		No corresp. P.Q.’s in H/L.



P.M.	Don’t by replies in H/C. spoil effect of M/D. statement in H/L.





	5.	Korea:  P.Q. on attack on Power Stations.



P.M.	This may lead them to say we sent Alex. out to hot it all up.

	Rather serious – new development.



N.	a)	They have bn. bombed once before – under Socialist Govt.

	b)	M/D. was consulted while in Korea &amp; raised no objn.



Sw.	But M/State reported to have said in W’ton it was first he had 

		heard of it.



N.	Alex may not have told him!



P.M.	Read draft answer.  “Attacks are no more than continuation of 

		existing policy:  no change of policy.”

	Thought no decns on policy wd. be taken by M/D. or M/State.

	“No change of policy tht. we are aware of:  matter falls w’in

		competence of U.N. Commr. &amp; is not covered by any special

		agreemt. betw. the 2 govts.”

                   x/	Add:  at end:  “in fact these power stations were previously bombed

		on - .”

				     [Exit  N.

				     [Enter  R. &amp; Att.G.

	6.	Privileges of International Organisations.



R.	We are commd to granting these privileges, esp. to specialised

		agencies.  For these &amp; others there is a clause to that effect in

		the instrument.  We have aimed at narrowing the scope of the 

		privileges.

	Now that N.A.T.O. has moved to Paris, we have only Wheat and 

		Brussels.

	Diffy really is tht. Socialists dropped this in deference to Swinton’s

		opposn.



P.M.	What is urgency?



R.	Must honour our commitments.  See p. 6.



P.M.	Why didn’t Socialists do it?



P.M.	Defer until next week?

Sal.	H/L. objected to widening circle of privilege.

	But we are committed here.  Shall have to do this.

	Moral:  avoid extending it further while we are in office.



Att.G.	Un. Postal Union has done w’out these privileges for 75 years.



M-F.	Can’t repudiate.  We must do it.

	Status of Un. Postal Union has changed since our speeches were

		made.



			Agreed:  Again next week.

			               Sim. to consider wtr. we are commd.
