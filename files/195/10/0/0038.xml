C.C. 24(52)							29th February 1952



		1.	Foreign Affairs Debate.		[Enter Sw. and A.Salter.



A.E.	Scott showed Morrison the pp. and brght them back, after C.R.A. had seen them.

	But A. Henderson was at Air Miny was shown some other F.O. telegrams.

	No harm done.  Also Cab. Minutes of the time were shown to him.

	No other Dpts. shd. show F.O. tels. or Cab minutes w’out reference to N.B., who will consult A.E. etc. as required.



P.M.	Guidance to Press v Cab. Ministers etc.  Not an official statement.



H.C.	Can we see the relevant telegrams – Saving? of May.  



P.M.  	Yes : circulate.





		2.	Royal Commission on Income Tax.



R.A.B.	Seen J.A. who will resign, by letter to P.M.



P.M.	I will reply – and publish both.



R.A.B.	Say Millard Tucker will wind up the work.





		3.	B.B.C. Meeting



L.P.S.	Ld. W. and I went last night: den of thieves united : but in wrong way.



	Said, mainly, this was not the moment.  Considering short renewal.  Cut across Parties.

	Had no effect whatever.

	Agreed tht. a few of them wd. meet 2 Ministers for a talk.

	Didn’t commit Cabinet.





		4.	External Sterling.



H.M.	i)  How does 10% corresp. with current drawings?



R.A.B.	Not all have agreemts.  But eg. Egypt wd. get a bit more than now.



H.M.	ii) Indep. s. area.  They wd. get £400 m. as 20% and £1600 m. frozen.  What are current drawing rights?



R.A.B.	Australia no agreement : they can draw at will.  This wd. release £80 m. for immed. use : but they mght. well fund it.

	India : wd. have enough fr. 20% for their developmt. plan.  Wd. accord roughly with recent agreemt.



	Pakistan : wd. get small release.  Doubt if they wd. leave st. area.



	Ceylon : have always wanted to leave s.a.  Depends largely on price of rubber.  Fin. Minister v. diff.



	S. Rhodesia : have new U.S. loan and wdn’t be troubled at all.



H.M.	But fr. our pt. view.  Do we gain by freeing £400 m.  Austr. seems only gain.  On f. countries only £86 m. freed.  Wd. they not buy dollars with it at once : to get out of sterling.



	Our action will be same under either scheme.  Thus –

	i)  B. plan purpose : Stop others running on our bank.

	ii) Timing.  Better when C.F.M. results seen and confidence created by Budget. Otherwise, can we get benefits eg. inflow of f.

	Capital.  If it goes wrong, you have lost reserves by m’taining rate.



	Over large no. of countries you give as much free money as now.



W.M.	i)  Labour.  Not decisive, but important.  Impact, with Budget

	may cause pol. strikes.  Last week-end;  speeches were made because there is a risk fr. extremists.  Substantl increase in c/living and rise in unemplt. wd. give diff. posn. to handle.

	ii)  If we are forced to this v. soon after Budget, much to be said for doing it with Budget.



L.P.S.	Started pro, but shaken by discn.

	After further study of pp. satisfied objns. outweigh advantages.

	Fr. fin. view recognise much to be said for it.  But fr. pol. angle gt. dangers.  “Public opinion inadequately prepared”.  Of course you can’t warm these measures.  But reversal of 12 years’ policy – stability of internal prices and wages.  Can’t stage violent reversals of policy in a pol. democracy.  eg. Hoare/Laval plan.  Was not a bad plan : but so sudden a reversal that p. opinion cdn’t take it.

	Right or wrong this policy wdn’t get across.

	Moreover, unbridgeable gap with Opposn.  Wd. end all hope of national unity.  Can’t rule out need for that if things got much worse. Must we accept view tht. no hope of U.S. aid?

	No certainty tht. B. plan wd. succeed – in his memo.  Gamble wd. be v. serious.



	Wd. oppose immediate action.  Must give time for consultn. with Doms. and real consultn.

	Favour A.E.’s approach.

Ch.	Alternative plan.  Para (d) – cuts more severe than under B. plan.

	Method of cut is important.  On alternative : we wd. select what is to be cut.  On B. plan price wd. limit what consumers’ get : wd. work more slowly : much unemplt. before people didn’t buy.

	Oppose rationing by the purse.



P.M.	Suggest R.A.B. shd. consider what has bn. said.  We shd. meet this pm. and decide.



	Sympathy with R.A.B.  But large diffce. of view, wholly on merits.

	Means it wd. be v. gt. risk to adopt this bold course.



R.A.B.	Can indicate diffies. of alternative.



W.	Is funding opn. necessary?  



R.A.B. 	Yes.  Too much on all.



R.A.B.	All financial advice (save economists) is we can’t get thro’ summer w’out exchange crisis.  And likely to come on publn. of March figures.

	All my colleagues advise me not to take 2 more bites.

	Hence this plan – wh. gives hope for future and moves twds. market rate.



	On U.S. aid, I’ve bn. much disappointed.  Memo. available.

	Y’day saw Holmes – he said in U.S.A. appropn.  Fr. were included as potential recipients and they got it.  We were not.  Our only hope was 10% of end item aid ($500 m.) was at Truman’s discretion.

	Our 300 m. was to come out of that.  But paymt. delayed.  Urged Holmes to expedite : they will try to attach it to past shipments.

	Comparison with France.  H. says Fr. has remainder of the 500 m. as well as U.S.A. appropn.



	No chance of more U.S. aid save under new Appropn. wh. begins to be debated in March.

	This makes all the more certain the need to act to save currency.

	Advice has always bn. pessimistic.  Never proved over-pessim.

	Tel. of 11/2 to C.F. Ministers.

	That is my opinion.  Wrong for me to delay.

	If we were bold enough to do this, we shd. be acting in time.

		Others prefer to wait for force majeure – Salter’s view, standby many 		of Cab.  Never so effective as timely action.

		L.P.S. case re dangers.  What other course.  P.T. suggested C.F.M. 

	mtg.  But can’t discuss in confce. so Draconian a plan.  When we act, it will have to be sudden.  Finance involves credit – confidence – can’t weaken it first.  Will see how to carry Comm. with us.

	We shall have to do this sometime, if not with Budget.

	If Cab. decide to defer, it’s easier for me.  Tho’ I think it wrong.







		Alternative.

	i)	Strong Budget.  Means tackling Food Subsidies.  Other 	unpleasant things too.

	ii)	Bank rate : 4% will be essential.  That will be said to be putting 	ourselves in hands of Banks.

	iii)	Cut in defence prodn.  If we work thro’ physical controls, not 	market rate, we must go back to Planning – tho’ I think it 	failed.  To adjust exports and prodn. for export.  Metal using 	industries have £470 m. on defence.  Must sell more munitions 	abroad.

	iv)	Cut in imports.  Asked Plowden for a plan.  It involves £200 m. 	cut in imports.  Larger cuts than in Plan B. (Cherwell 	dissented.)  Wheat strategic stocks wd. go (down to 10 wks) : 	sugar as before : animal feed : run down raw materials.  	Softwood : either 50.000 standards or 10 m. (Plowden) with cut 	in housing p’mme.  Cuts in zinc.  Removal of o.g. licences.  	Tobacco 4¾ m.  Delay Service oil stocking.  Totals £150 m.

	v)	Europe.  B. plan threatened E.P.U. and Eur. unity.  But 	alternative means further de-liberalisation.  Machinery, textiles 	and food.  This may involve retaliation.



P.M.	Can’t be blamed if we haven’t the money to pay for imports.



R.A.B.	The £150 m. avoids cutting into Eur. but v. stiff and may have to cut at E. if they are thght too severe.



	(vi) Wd. approach Comm. Govts. and ask them to raise C.F.M. targets.

	Cd. we do anythg. with balances?  Comm. wd. not accept if we don’t touch for. balances.  But if you do latter you end sterling as a currency (internatl.).

	So we shall have to leave balances alone.  Tho’ we cd. ask them to fund or to accept paymts. and agreemts.

	(vii)  Investment.  Cancel depreciatn allowces.  Cut housing p’mme.

	(viii) Borrowing.  Wrong to try on an old negative policy.  Shd. have to pledge securities.



Sw.	Cuts in imports.  “Less under B. than A.”.  Cd. we see both?



R.A.B.	Will circulate these.



		Adjourned until 3 pm.



P.M.	On assumptn. tht. we are not suff. united in conviction to warrant launching Plan B.
