C.C. 45(52)							23rd April 1952



		1.	Farm Price Review.			[Enter Ll.G., T.D. &amp; Sw.



T.D.	Decision of 3/4 : £52½ m. gross.  8/4 Turner, w’out support of his team, faced his Council and got their authority to go on at £52½ m. subject to reservns. incldg. animal food prices.  Ministers met that evening and decided to hold those prices stable until Mar ’53.  Turner assumed tht. this included sugar beet pulp – not w’out reason in view of correspondence.



	I ought to have warned my colleagues of this, and didn’t.  Apologise.

	I authd. offls to go on negotiating schedule, on basis tht. pulp wd. be subject of later Ministerial settlement.

	Invite attention to paras. 7-8 of memo.

	Standstill on animal feed cd. extend to pulp – that cd. be defended easily.



	“Large farms” : 78% are under 100 acres.

	Total increase, on turnover, is only 3½%.



Ll.G.	Twice in H/C. we have announced decision to increase pulp price.  Shall have to give a good reason for reversing it.

	Misunderstanding is fault of farmers’ Union.  Animal feed prices have bn. handled separately fr. pulp.  40.000 contracts made includg. new pulp price – no decrease of acreage.  The increase was part of last yrs’ agreemt.



	Total settlement, with this, wd. be £54 m.  This means (?) £13 m. increase in food prices.  Under Budget we are reducg. subsidies – loaf up by 3d. : butter, eggs and bacon will have to rise.  This settlement means further increases.  We must therefore be able to defend farmers’ settlement.  Can we defend this?  Giving more to farmers than they need?



L.P.	If contracts exchanged on current prices, why shd. we increase this price.



T.D.	Issued 18/10 “M/F. expects pulp will be sold at not more than £19.10d. p. ton.” to be fixed by subsequent Order – not yet made.



L.P.	We agreed with Union on current prices.  We shd. stand on this and refuse farmers’ request.



R.A.B.	Effect on not yielding on negotns?  Case on merits is clear.

	But Turner has behaved well and he attaches sp. importance to this.



T.D.	If this is rejected, we shan’t get agreemt. by tomorrow.  Turner wd. have to seek fresh instructns.

H.C.	Factory in my constituency.  Farmers perturbed at delay in settlemt.

	We ought to announce tomorrow.

	Current price (L.P.) is the price the farmers want to m’tain.



L.P.	If you give £600.000 for this, can you w’hold £½ m. from wool?



O.L.	Matter of faith : don’t insist on increased pulp prices.



Sw.	Critical point of negotns. for Turner.  Concede this. 



Sal.  	I agree.

		

		Agreed : Let the pulp price be governed by the general

		standstill.

							[Exit Ll.G. &amp; J.D.



		2.	General Certificate of Education.	[Enter F. Horsbrugh.



F.H.	As in memo.

	The Council includes repves. of various Socialist bodies.  Unlikely to be political trouble over this.



Sw.	Present this as implementg. the policy we advocated at election viz. emphasise (b) via (a) of para. 5.  Stress the discretion.



F.H.	In answering P.Q. I will say first that Council have agreed tht. the excessive rigidity be abandoned.



L.P.	Rest on the power of Minister to decide – don’t suggest tht. it’s the decision of the Council.

							[Exit F.H. Enter D.S. 							Maclay., B.H.

		3.	Road and Rail Transport.



		(a)	Passenger Fares.



P.M.	Saw R.A.B. last evening : there are arguments v. publishg. before Debate.  

	W’out W. Paper debate will be a row on fares – ok. if we have a policy on that.  With a W. Paper will be lifted to a level on wh. we have got a policy.

	Have we any policy on fares, incldg. London?



L.	We have for Provinces : but diff. in Ldn. is tht. they are in operation.

	Cost of what we propose (anomalies) wd. be only about £2½ m. of wh. about 50/50 betwn. Ldn. and Provinces.



P.M.	No general reduction of fares?  No adjustment of bus stages?

	

L.	No.  All that is settled now.  Wdn’t disturb it.

	Commn. had discretion re sub standard fares : we shd. be regulating that.

	Buses  “     “         “  to adjust stages.  That is a London ques. only.

	No repercussion fr. anything we intervened on outside Ldn.



P.M.	Cd. we confine our action to anomalies and wd. that correspond with area in wh. we can over-ride viz., can we say we can’t over-ride the general increases?  



Sim.  	Yes : we intervene up to the limit of the area w’in wh. Commn. exercised a discretion.

	

M.F. 	Yes : to go further and over-ride Tribunal wd. mean directg. B.T.C. to submit a new scheme.  A more diff. operation.



R.A.B.	Had hoped concessions on fares wd. not cost more than £1 m.  That cd. be absorbed in B.T.C. finances.



P.M.	That’s not much to say in H/C.



R.A.B.	Don’t yet know how far we mean to go in Ldn. concessions.



Ch.	Public will take general increase of 10% or so.  What they won’t take is sudden removal of basis (workmen’s fares) on wh. so many people have organised their living.



Macl.	Complicns. in Ldn. are so great tht. I fear we can’t solve them w’out submn. of fresh scheme to Trib.  



L. 	Because of inter-relation of bus and rail fares in Ldn.  Can’t do it w’out advice of B.T.C.



P.M.	If no W. Paper, Motion wd. be limited to fares.



		(b)	Publication of W. Paper.



P.M.	Ch.’s views : risk of criticism by B.T.C. if they haven’t bn. consulted.

	Paras. 15-16.  Cab. agreed, subject to L.’s drafting points.



Ch.	Unwise to publish W. Paper w’out seeing wthr. B.T.C. support can be enlisted.

	Increases the risk of damaging criticism.



L.P.	Agree.  I had always intended they shd. be consulted.



R.A.B.	I have always held that view because B.T.C. will have to operate road haulage until all is sold.

	W. Paper stresses increased diffy. of rlways in competing.  Awkward to relate that to fares controversy.



P.M.	Means 2 days in H/C.



H.C.	I’m against publishg. with such short notice before Monday’s debate.

	H/C. wd. resent it – not enough time to consider.



J.S.	I agree.  Wd. like to enlist B.T.C. support.



O.L.	Convinced by the argument tho’ I began by favouring publn.



W.M.	Convinced i) consultn. with B.T.C. and (ii) H.C.’s point.

	Monday’s debate will turn on having somethg. satisfy. to say on Ldn. fares.



P.M.	Motion for Monday must propose specific measures incldg. Ldn. fares.

	At least i) abolition of anomalies outside London.  ii) approve appln. to Ldn. of same principles so far as they are applicable – with an estimate of the cost.



M-F.	Are we agreed that principle of m’taining sub-standard fares is to be applied in Ldn. as elsewhere?  And that, if B.T.C. won’t do it, we are ready to direct them to do so?  We must be sure about that.  



P.M.  	I am quite clear.

							[Exit D.S. Maclay.
