C.C. 60(52)							17th June 1952



		1.	Welcome to R.G.M.			[Enter Sw., L.B. J.T.





		2.	Royal Visit to Australia.



		Gothic – approved.

		Dates – Jan-March preferred.  Jan for N.Z., Feb/Mar. for Austr.



P.M.	I will advise accordingly.



R.A.B.	Thanks for financial offer – experts will consult on detail.



							[Exit L.B. and J.T.

		3.	Europe.



A.E.	Appeal to G. court tht. E.D.C. can’t be ratified w’out ⅔rds. majority.

	Trouble if this succeeds, for Adenaur cdn’t get such a majority.

	Opposn. mainly fr. Schumacher, who is ill : Reuter, who wd. prs. succeed him, wd. be more friendly.

	Fr. continue to vacillate, but E.D.C. their own child – they are bound to ratify.

	R. - tension mainly in Berlin.





		4.	Korea.



A.E.	Indians in touch with Chinese on p.o.w.

	Krishna has indicated terms wh. Ch. wd. accept.

		Either i) Prefer round figure 110.000 to be returned – 20.000 Chinese 	remainder could stay.  No more discn. of principle. That would not be 	acceptable to us.  We have only 20.000 Ch.



		Or ii)  U.N. Command to agree tht. all p.o.w. shd. go home.

		Those disinclined may come to P., not under escort, to be interviewed 	by panel fr. * 4 States and R. Cross.  Ch. and K. Govts. will abide by 	decn  at interview.  This is first admn. of a neutral decn. and tht. they 	wd. 	abide by it.



	This is worth examn. and telling U.S. privately.

		* Pol., Czech, Sweden and Switz.



	Respectable process wd. be agreeable to us – R. Cross wd. help from that angle.



P.M.	I prefer ii)



M.	Agree U.S. shd. be consulted.  Encourage any decent escape fr. our dilemma.

		5.	Persia : “Mary Rose”.



A.E.	Asked R.A.F. to find her.  She is some way off Aden. – supposed making 5 knots wd. reach Aden Wed. or Tues. pm.  No one believes she is past Aden, as reported.  Hope she will go there.  Don’t want to act in Suez, where eg. courts.



L.	Master promised to go into Aden. 



A.E.	Trieste wd. be next best.  



L. 	She cdn’t get there – not enough fuel.



A.E.	M’while Mussadiq may fall quite soon.  More hopeful than at any time  since Nov.  Persia Cttee mtg. Fri. – will report to Cabinet.





		6.	Trade Talks.



M.	Area of debate v. narrow : for reslns. imposed to preserve our balances.

	Discn. with P.T. directed to search for small accommns of psych. importce.

	3 points – i) some A. importers thght to be using this to escape fr. old contracts and make easier new ones.  Agreed tht. quota for cat. B. goods must be applied first to firm existg. contracts – principle accepted.



	Cd. usefully be announced.



		    ii) hardship cases….



	My Cab. pre-occupied with their pol. diffies.  Want to leave room, in

                x/	announcement, to try again in Canberra.



P.T.	Both M. and I am disapptd we can’t do more.

	Welcome assurance at x/.

	One addn.  I  did press tht. A. shd. ease up on U.K. quotas first.  For goods bght. outside st. area have to be paid for in gold and dollars.

	M. thinks he can’t discriminate these – but we shall have to balk on this in wider context.



M.	Won’t do to talk now of discrimn. or preferences – wd. do us harm in U.S. eg. on our loan.

	Fact is : limits to wh. we can discrim. v. continental customs because we have v. large balances with them.  But impressed by gold argument.  Wd. prefer to deal ad hoc when reslns. come off and not make any genl. statement in advance.  There will be sympathetic approach.



P.T.	Communiqués – Statement after Ques.



Sal.	Have got M.’s texts.



		Agreed : M., Sal. and P.T. to vet draft statements.





		7.	Commonwealth Meeting on Commercial Policy.



Sal.	M. has stressed need for common approach – publicly and privately.

	P’mme of work.

	Common approach will need much prepn. work.  Each Govt. must first clear own mind – then joint discn. – then consider what further action (tho’ m’while indiv. countries wd. be free to approach U.S. on own problems).

	We shan’t be ready before end ’52.  C.F.M. called for Jan. in Ldn.

	Shd. that be widened to cover comm. policy – other Ministers attending too.  Avoids special confce.  See what progress then made : Govts. to consider results : P.M.N. cd. reach final decisions in June.



	R.A.B. and P.T. agree.

	No public announcemt. until other Doms. can be consulted.



M.	Value of such discns. is clear.  Diff. for R.A.B. to discuss finance w’out taking a/c of trade policy and vice versa.  Trade leads to developmt. ques, wh. affect capital movemts. w’in Comm.  Favour early considn. of these problems – shdn’t be regarded as hostile to any other group.

	Concert our policies, wthr. by preference or otherwise.

	Much preparat. work by experts will be essential, if pol. conference is to produce results.  Stress need for prelimy. work.  Wd. wish this tackled well in advance of Jan. mtg.



Sal.	Agree – don’t want to risk spectacular confce. w’out adequate prepn.



R.A.B.	Mtg. of offls. on finance in Aug.  Cd. if necessary expand to cover commerce.



A.E.	Slow – qua public presentn.  18 mos. after our Manifesto.

	Wd. have preferred conference of P.M.’s.  Wd. Nov. be possible vice Jan?



R.A.B.	P.M.M. in June anyway.  Nov. is v. diff. month for A., N.Z., India or Ceylon – Parly. business.

	Agree public impact won’t be v. dramatic.



P.T.	Desirable to have it earlier.  But immense prepn. : can’t be ready before Jan.  But decns. will be v. important : doubt if they cd. be taken other than by P.M.’s.



P.M.	Cd. P.M.’s come in Jan and June?



M.	Politics.  P.T. and I have bn. discussing relatively small matter : gt. pol. heat engendered.  Only way out is to raise it to much higher levels.  From our point of view and yours gt. merit in lifting publ. attentn. to these wider issues.

	Wd. like a mtg. as soon as practicable.  We cd. attend effectively by early November. Wd. like to get it into 1952.



Sw.	Political advantage of ’52.  All Govts. shd. make their views clear – impn. in U.K. tht. M. want it and U.K. hanging back.



		Agreed :  	Work towards Nov. as date.



Sal:	Level.  Risk to stage it at P.M. level and fail.



P.M.	Surely we cd. see by then what chances of success.



M.	Get agreemt. to meet on a date, pref. in 1952.

               x/	Set up a Cttee of managers (joint) to organise the work in readiness for it.



	Ought to hold it in ’52.  Will do us all good : we are workg. in sep. compartments on what are largely common problems.

	Produces depression of spirit.



P.M.	Welcome x/.



M.	I agree with this procedure : will participate in x/. will be effectively represented at mtg.



A.E.	2nd half of Nov.



M.	I cd. attend by then.  Believe P.M.’s shd. come.



		Agreed :	Cttee of Managers.

				Mtg. 2nd half of Nov., prob. on P.M. level.

		[R.A.B.  Not too large : no second Ottawa.]





		8.	Defence Equipment.			[Enter D.S. and Birch.



D.S.	2 lists – i) mobiln and ii) stockpiling.  Considered i) Figure given.

	Naval p’mme longer : others 3 year period.

	Army : we shd. have v. little diffy. if A. orders are phased into ours.



	Included 190 Centurions.

	Air.  Bid in 2 classes	a) those h’to expected fr. U.S. £32 m. (A)

				b)   “    from U.K. £15m. (A).

	Odds and ends bring it up to £90 m.

	Sq. Canberras can be supplied.  34 Prince trainers.

	Cost of makg. them here is much less than makg. extra ones in A.

	Sabres plan.  Will cost more.  Already obsolescent.  If we cd. phase in deliveries of Hunters and Swifts to A. that wd. be much better.

	We have held off Sabres because of lack of dollars.

	C.119 transports.  R.A.F. can’t have them “    “  .  We are takg. B’burn freighters instead.  Cd. A. consider joining us in a p’mme of those?

	Army regard it as ideal machine.

	Naval reconnaissance ‘planes.  Wd. A. consider Shackletons as alternative to U.S. models.



	Summing up : with poss. exceptn of fighters, we can meet A.’s needs.



P.M.	How will detail be settled.



M.	I will take up aircraft suggns. on my return.  Can’t liquidate our aircraft industry and may have to expand engine capacity.

	But main ques. is vital.  Increased demand on us for food prodn.

	With processes involved, wd. be mistake to expand munitions prodn. unduly.  Hence  a) food is high priority for U.K. and you want us to give due attn. to it. b) We must be able to look to you to provide the equipmt. we can’t easily make in A.

	And we go on to your shopping list.  This doesn’t restrict oblign. to raise and train forces.

	Have discussed with M/F. who are studying demands likely to be made on us for food over period of years.

							         [Exit Birch and D.S.



		9.	Communiqué.



		P.M.’s statement approved.

		M. will make 2 of his own.





		10.	Central African Federation.



O.L.	Not heard …..

	Gone as far as poss. to safeguard African interests.

	Statement, tho’ long, is factual.



M.	Read it with interest.  Found some familiar federal sentences – wh. don’t always work as planned.

Sal.	S. Rh. will have to surrender some powers to Fed. Govt: as time gets nearer they will like it less.  Referendum will have to be held.

	Diff., but if we don’t get this Fedn. clock will be put back for years.



		Approved.





		11.	Kashmir.



Sal.		Latest developments.

	P. may press for action v. India.  Sanctions wd. be provocative.

	W’drawal of Point 4 aid wd. be exasperatg. and ineffective.

	But some encouragemt. to P. is necessary.

	Best solution may be a resoln. by S. Council wh. blames India but does nothg. much more.

	Not heroic : but other courses wd. be more dangerous.

	Tension is lower.  Both sides really want to avoid war.



M.	Possible to insert expn. of opinion to effect tht. undue dispropn betwn. Forces must be source of dissatisfn. and directg. attention of parties to that.  It is the real crux.

							[Enter P.M.G.

Sal.	Will consider that.





		12.	G.P.O. Terrington Report.



P.M.G.	Tories commd. in opposn. in favour of splinter unions.

	Statement tomorrow - M /L. agrees with it.

	Thank Cttee but say I don’t intend to enforce its recommns. on the Unions.  Shall take line it’s not for employers (State or other) to say who shall represent the staff.  The workers must make up their minds about that; and to give them a chance to do so I propose to do nothg. for 6 mos.



J.S.	V. diff. politically because of our pledges.

	But see no better course.



R.A.B.	Fin. Secy. is against this because of his past.

	Accept the delay – so long as B-C. not too closely associated with it.



A.E.	12 months to 6?



P.M.G.	6 is enough : M/L. agrees.  He wd. be embarrassed by any other course.  H.C. is satisfied with 6 months.

	But I cd. say “in early part of next year.”



P.M.	P’pone until Tuesday next.

	Circulate text m’while.

	You can promise statement next Tuesday.

							[Exit P.M.G.



		13.	Menzies.



P.M.	Thanks.  Wise counsel : stimulating influence.

	Best Wishes.  Safe journey and early report.



M.	Appreciate understanding attitude of Ministers.

	Talks more useful than immedte. results.

	Liked talking again to old friends.
