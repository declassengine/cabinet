C.C. 37(52)							4th April 1952



		1.	Name of Royal Family.		[Enter Sw., O.P., P.B.



P.M.	Is it necessary to have this published in Gazette.



Sim.	Wd. allay idle talk.



P.M.	V. well.  Will reconsider if Queen dislikes this publicity.





		2.	Farm Price Review.



R.A. B.	Letter to M/Ag. fr. N.F.U.  Turner says he wishes £52½ m. net : other condns. also.  M/Ag. and Ty. think this involves addl. £4 m. Vandepeer thinks even at that figure they will kick v. redn. in milk prices.  If we give way, we shall go too far.  Better to stand on y’day’s decision.  

	Farmers meet on Tuesday.  £52½ m. (if we stick to it will be put to them then).



A.E.	Can a memo. be circulated, for informn. over week end.



P.M.	Yes : but let us stand by our decision of y’day.





		3.	Textile Industries.



P.M.	Can’t take decisions, but wd. like prelim. discn.

	Hope vigorous action can be taken on p. tax.



R.A.B.	If we made £40 m. concession on p. tax, it wd. affect only 30% of indies. because many goods free of tax.  Retail Distrib. say tax holiday won’t help.  Our concln. : Govt. orders is best method of giving direct help.  Ordered enquiry into means of placing up to £20 m. such orders.



P.T.	About one week’s work in whole of Lancs.  But cd. be useful if directed to the bad areas where other work is not available.



L.P.	Can those areas produce those goods?  



P.T.  	That is being considered.



L.P.	Don’t want tax holiday on p. tax – disruption of trading.



P.T.	I agree.  P. tax concessions won’t make much impact.  But some anomalies in D. scheme cd. be removed with advantage.



R.A.B.	Intend to make such concessions in Cttee Stage of Finance Bill.



Sw.	More dollar cotton.  Some months since non-dollar cotton was 60% over but now diffce. is only ½ cent. betwn. U.S. and Brazilian. There is now nothing in this point.

P.M.	We must make gt. efforts to help Lancs., none the less.



Ch.	Falling off in world demand.  What can you do to help that?



L.P.	Prices will go on falling.  



P.M. 	May revive demand.



		Resume discussion on Tuesday.





		4.	National Assistance.



O.P.	Bd. propose increase of 5/= (single) and 9/= (married).

	Rates last fixed Sept.

	This won’t come in until mid June : and they take a/c of prospective rise in c/living m’while.

	Advise we present these to Parlt. before Recess.



R.A.B.	Accept this.  Feared it might be more.



Sw.	Before announcemt, Minister shd. concert publicity with Central Office.

	Applies equally to Minute 5.



P.B.	Will T.U.’s be able to see this includes anticipn. of c/living increases to come.  Wd. be used in wage negotns. – where we prefer a lag!



O.P.	We can’t have constant changes.  Bd. always say they have taken a/c of current trends – to forestall criticism.



		Memo.  approved.





		5.	National Insurance.



P.M.	Fear criticism tht. Tories are increasg. retiring age.  Aren’t T.U.’s leading us into a trap?  OK. if it remains optional : but dangerous to cut into contracts.



L.	Miners are staying on, under option.



R.A.B.	We cd. have enquiry into o. age generally.  Young aren’t too keen to carry so big a burden.  OK. if we don’t press for 67.



P.M.	Don’t let us say any more about 67.

	T.U.’s will turn us down and claim the credit.

O.P.	Raising age is off the map for time being – clear fr. my consultns.

	Only ques. now : crushing burden suggests need of general enquiry into means of handling this – incldg. optional arrangemts.  There is also ques. of supplementary industry schemes – enquiry on that cd. be merged into general enquiry into means of persuading people to remain on in industry.



A.E.	Don’t be committed to this enquiry now because present political climate.

	Let’s see t. of r.  And wait a bit.



O.P.	Will put t. of r. to H.A. Cttee. in first instance.



M-F.	Hope Bill for increased benefits can be hastened.



R.A.B.	M/P. is coming out v. soon.

	Income tax concessions will come on 8/6, when backlog will be paid.



O.P.	Want to make statement on Wed. next and introduce Bill immed. after Easter Recess.  



H.C.  	Tuesday wd. be a better day.



	Re enquiry : want discretion to make it clear, if leakage continues tht. proposed to raise age include provn. for larger pension. 



P.M.  	Why.



 O.P.  	To clear our record if it’s attacked.



P.M.	Let me see statement in draft.

							[Exit O.P.



		6.	European Defence Community.



A.E.	Suggn.  G. covered by what we said on Berlin Air Lift.  We need now only cover Italy.  The 6 will then make reciprocal offer.

	E.D.C. runs longer than N.A.T.  So we shd. limit our guarantee to period of N.A.T. – so tht. we don’t get left in when U.S. is out. 

	We may be asked to send observer to E.D.C.  I favour that.  



P.M.  	So do I.



O.P.	No comment.



A.E.	We mght publish in 2 wks.  U.S. decln. wd. be v. helpful.



L.P.S.	Inform Doms.  (Agreed).



H.M.	Support this.

	Document re situation in France confirm my views.



		Memo.  approved.





		7.	Egypt.



A.E.	Progress not good.  Sudan hasn’t helped.

	Two alternatives to escape deadlock :-



	i)  Recall Stevenson and Howe for discussions.

	ii) Go to Cairo and Kh myself …….



P.M.	Don’t like para. 2.

	Hold on somehow.   a) Show E. they can’t turn us out by force or threats.  b) Tell U.S. proper provn. must be made for securg. safety of Canal.

	We don’t offer to do that for ever.  They and the French must come in and help.  Then, with Turkey, we cd. force E. to join in 5 Power system.



	Base in M/E.  Asked M/D. to prepare a lecture on extent of threat to M/E. by R. (see Minute).  My view : strong Air Base in Cyprus wd. suffice to hold back, by denying Communns. any R. advance upon M/E.

	I’m not convinced tht. big M/E. base is vital.  All we need is enough strength to keep E. in her place in peace and preserve the Canal.



A.E.	Do you wish me to break off negotiations?

	Is memo. acceptable or not?



P.M.	Para. 2 certainly is unacceptable.



L.P.S.	We are all pledged to a M/E. Pact.  My only doubt is wthr. we can get fwd. on bi-lateral basis?  If we cd. get it on to multi-lateral basis, we cd. pin down E. re M/E. Pact at same time as we commit ourselves to w’drawal.



Al.	Striking force near Canal, eg. At Gaza, wd. suffice to protect security of Base.  A Brigade Gp. wd. prob. do, to start with.

	We want E. agreemt. to air organisation.  They wdn’t dare attack it once it was under Allied control.

	C.O.S. content with memo. save for word “thus”.  Only intended for purpose of getting negotns. resumed.



A.E.	Can’t get other Powers into negotns. at outset.



Sw.	Unless E. accepted 4 Power basis in some form or another, we shd. not conclude an agreement.



A.E.	If you don’t want para. 2., I’ll leave it out.  I put it in to serve our own advantage.



		Agreed :  Approve para. 1. only.  Omit para. 2.
