C.C. 8(51)							19th  November 1951



		1.	Miners’ Wages.				[Enter G.L.L



L.	V. complex wage structure.

	Wages raised to point at wh. now highest industry – surface as well as face.



	Concerned today with genl. structure.  Porter Award caused much ill feeling tht. N.C.B. had to make better offer : lesson – don’t go to arbitration.



	Present claim : 18% increase.  V. large.  Consulted Ty. and M/L. Came at a time when Tribunal had just given 8% to rlwaymen – 10 days ago.  N.C.B. met N.U.M. : found 8% wd. not be accepted.  Pressing also for 2nd wks’ holiday, to wh. they are entitled on basis of earlier award. Can’t really afford it qua output.  Offering to pay them not to take it.



	If we stand on 8% we shall get taken to arbitn.  N.C.B. want discretion to go to 9.5% - 11.5% - somewhere between.  May get settlement on a means around 10%.  We shan’t get it for less.

	They won’t discuss means of increasg. output until wages claim is settled.

	10% increase wd. mean £20 m.  3/= a ton, takg. in increased costs.



W.M.	Engineers’ 11/= is much lower increase on basis of skilled rates.



L.	Cdn’t make exceptional treatment on income tax for miners alone.



R.A.B.	Also B/I.R. wd. find it diff. to exempt a portion of income.  T.U.C. are against segregating a portion.



O.L.	Also increase pressure for shorter hours – to get more on tax free overtime.



P.M.	Mechanisation.  



L. 	Improvg. especially in Yorks and N. Midland Regions.



W.M.	Horner (Comm.) is handling these negotns.  Will he respond on output, after wage claim met?

	Wages : and also holiday (2nd wk).

	Rlways have accepted 8%.  Many other indies. resent special treatmt for miners.  If we cede higher %age on a higher base, rlways will come again.  Also 11/= for engineers and shipblders is less than 10% on a lower base.  Award of 10% to miners will start the 2nd round of wage claims.



L.	Can’t get settlement by agreemt. at 8%.

	Wd. rather settle around 10% than go to arbitn.  Because then they will be more willing to co-operate on output.



R.A.B.	Importance of coal.  Internal.  Also international – taken as earnest of our good faith.

	Can’t we get organised labour to see this as somethg. special.



Ch.	Support R.A.B.  May have to say miners are privileged class.

	Manpower.



W.M.	Personnel managemt. to keep recruits from leaving.



Ch.	Houses.



M.F.	a)  O.M.S. at face.  Is it increasing.   b) Can we m’tain it?



L.	Yes, individually.  But shall lose nos. and thus output in total.



Ch.	Measure by man year.  For they work fewer shifts.



P.M.	If we don’t offer more, will it go to arbitration.



L.	Believe arbitn. wd. give as much as 10% and a bad spirit also.



R.A.B.		Give L. this discretion.  But follow up with big drive for greater output.



P.M.		Let us not at once seem unsympathetic to their claims.



Sim.		Choice : concession or go to arbitn.

		Tribunal wd. award about 10% or so, I believe (on my experience).

		Better therefore to make the concession.



W.M.		I wd. sooner have this imposed by arbitn.

		For I’m sure this will be followed by a second round of claims.

		Concession wd. keep miners sweet : but wd. make other industries 			sour.



		Agreed :  L. to authorise N.C.B. to make the concession.



						                              [Exit G.LL. and

						                               [Enter W.S.

		2.	Germany’s Defence Contribution.



S.		We recommend para. 14(a) in first instance.

		On choices in para. 12.  We reject (ii) and (iii).  This leaves (i).

		Can’t reduce our forces in Germany.  But might economise elsewhere 		in defence.  Also figures are prob. inflated.  There will still be a gap : 		and U.S. will have to fill it.  A.E. cd. promises economies on forces in 		Germany.



Ch.	Also we cd. cut cost of providing German units.

	Also on or forces in G. if Ty. paid.

	Also p’mmes, here and in G., won’t go so fast as is here assumed.
