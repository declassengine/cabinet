C.M. 89(52).				23rd October, 1952.

					

				[Enter Sw., B-H.	

	1.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Two of the 3 promised days on natd industries.

	Thursday:  Prorogation about 3 p.m. after debate on 

		Dankwerts Award.





	2.	Corporal Punishment.



P.M.	Thought our posn was tht. no case had bn. made out for restorn 

		of c.p.



Sim.	Debate took unexpected turn – Goddard advocated w’spread extension

		of c.p. to offences not liable to that penalty for 100 years.



P.M.	Wait for opinion to form:  it may be more humane than long terms of

		impt.  Don’t confine ourselves necessarily to offences for 

		wh. c.p. has bn. recently available.

                     *	Cabinet may discuss this – one day when we have nothg. to do.





	3.	Accession Declaration.



Sim.	Form of declaration altered in 1910 at request of King Geo., who 

		thought old form offensive to R.C.’s.



A.E.	Easiest course = follow precedent of 1937.	Agreed.



Sim.	Elizabeth – subject to views of the Queen.	Agreed – submit to

				                Queen.



					[Enter  G.Ll.

	4.	Persia.



A.E.	U.S. are v. anxious to give money to Persia &amp; we may be unable to

		restrain them.  But we ought to try to hold them to principle of

		arbitration.



Ch.	Cd we say to U.S. – you pay us our claim &amp; get what you can out of 

		Persia.



A.E.	There is something in that.  But risky to suggest tht. U.S. have 

		succeeded to our oil inheritance in Persia.  V. good business for 

		us.  A.I.O.C. don’t want it any longer.

	Shall I put a note on this to Cabinet?



P.M.	Yes:  explore that.  I wdn’t be afraid of that.



A.E.	Not impossible that U.S. wd. look at this.

				[Exit  B-H., G.Ll.

				[Enter  de L’Isle

	5.	Export of Arms:  Jet Aircraft for Egypt.



P.M.	Wd give Egypt a substantial advantage over Israel.  3:1.  Doubtful.



A.E.	Ques. wtr. we want to give Neguib a helping hand – he is having

		a pretty tough time with his supporters, in persuadg. them that

		a policy of friendship with west is worth while.  I have felt he is

		best bet we have had in Egypt.  Wd have liked to help him.



P.M.	Reluctant.



A.E.	He is askg. for 5.  Shall we start with that, and eke it out.



de L’I.	We have plenty wh. I can’t take because I haven’t the money.

	Want to sell all we can, in order to keep industry together in order to

		build new types when we can afford them.

	Remedy is to sell more to Jews.



A.E.	But they can’t pay:  they’re bust.



Al.	Settlement with E. wd. enable us to reduce our commitments.

	Won’t get settlement unless we help Neguib.  We haven’t done v. 	much for them.



A.E.	E. have paid 20% deposit.

	Will try 5 jets + 2 trainers and the others v. soon.  And if Israel protests

                  x/		we might try to give them a few more.  May I have discretion to

		go to 14.



J.S.	Para. 5.  Wd this not give us chance to get somethg. done re murders.



A.E.	Yes.  Wd have liked to get concession on Canal;  but U.S. wdn’t join

		me in this.



P.M.	Keep them sweet until we can find out wtr. a new U.S. Adminn 

		really means to arm Egypt in spite of danger to Jews.



de L’I.        x/	If we are anxious, train a few more J. pilots in U.K.



A.E.	Yes.

			Agreed:  as at xx/.

					[Exit  de L’I.



	

 

	6.	Saar.



A.E.	French have rejected formula.  Askg. for more:  they won’t get it.

	Have urged them m’while to p’pone elections – anyway until Monday.

	French are crazy to lose this chance.  V. disappointing.



			                                                 [Enter  T.D., Ll.G., J. Foster.

	7.	East/West Trade:  Rubber.



A.E.	Concerned because we aren’t getting enough grain in return for the

		rubber.  Wd like to react by sending less rubber, but believe it’s

		not so easy.



Ch.	I wdn’t give more than last year.  Relate it to amount of grain.



O.L.	R. pay for the rubber &amp; we cd. buy grain with that elsewhere.

	Avoid rough &amp; ready barter.  They pay in international division.



Sw.	And they wd. draw it fr. Indonesia if we didn’t sell it.



O.L.	The 80.000 t. of last year is still the limit.



A.E.	If we keep to that figure U.S. will have no legitimate complaint.



P.M.	V. well – if we can say we are not exceeding last year’s 

		total.



J.F.	Warning:  Ceylon are about to conclude agreemt. to supply a lot of

		rubber.





	8.	Agricultural Marketing Boards.



T.D.	V. important.  M. Bds. accepted by Party.  Politically committed to 		them.  F. &amp; A. Cttee agreed tht. new marketg. Bds. be

		encouraged;  &amp; that Ministers cd. secure sufficient safeguards.	Opposn shdn’t object to exclusion because their past record.

	Since ’51. – B/T. raised ques. of inclusion w’in Monopolies Commn.

		We suggd means of using a Marketing Council under 1949 Act.

		We have induced farmers to accept that, with diffy.  M/F. prefers

		that system.

	Now Cab. has decided not to go on with Monopolies Bill.  I must go

		on with Marketg. Council scheme.  Farmers won’t produce the 

		schemes if they are threatened with still further machinery of

		control.

	Damage to producers’ confidence wd. far exceed anythg. hanging

		to Monop. Bill, now v. distant.



P.T.	Academic.  No Bill.

	Under law now, Commn can’t investigate statutory monopolies.

		We have always opposed that exclusion.  Dpts. (natd indies &amp;

		agric.) don’t like being brought in.  But contrary to what we 

		have always said.

	Can’t we tell farmers that we don’t yet know what will be in Bill?



T.D.	Schemes are being held up because of this.

	Want to be able to say they won’t be in Bill.  Undertaking.



P.T.	Keep it open.



P.M.	Farmers have no right to ask for such a guarantee.



R.A.B.	Support T.D.  Ministers’ powers are enough.



P.T.	Warn you tht. it will be diff. to exclude agric. monopolies but not

		natd industries.



P.M.	“As at present advised we see no reason to strengthen existg. powers		of Ministers to safeguard public interest.”

	Or	NO intentn in present circs. to make any change in existg. system		by wh.

	x/	We don’t anticipate will be nec. to make any altn in present

		system in view of powers of Ministers to safeguard public

		interest.



			Agreed:  M/Ag. authorised to use formula at x/.





	9.	Tariff Policy:  Horticultural Products.



	Not heard.



R.A.B.	Let P.E.C. look at this, next week.



P.T.	O.K.  But I’ve got a lot to do first e.g. see the N.F.U.



A.E.	Avoid public statement.  Continue with private discussions.



H.C.	Think statement must be made.  It sets out the facts.



A.E.	Explain the awkward facts, privately, but avoid public statement.



J.F.	Less we say the better.  More likely to get agreemt. in Nov., if we

		say nothing more publicly in interim.



A.E.	Only a few weeks to go now, before C.E.C.



T.D.           x/	Let P.T. see farmers &amp; Party Cttee, avoid public statement, &amp; report

		back to Cabinet.

			

			Agreed as at x/.

				[Exit  T.D., Ll.G., J.F.



	10.	George Bundock.



A.E.	No hope of smuggling him out.



P.M.	Is there nothing nasty we can do to them?



A.E.	Can’t think of anything.



			Advise, but don’t press him to surrender.



P.M.	Don’t do anything.     }

	Again in 3 months.     }
