C.C. 10(52).							5th February 1952



		1.	Civil Defence.			[Enter 3 Serv. Ministers &amp; M/S.



P.M.	Sirens etc.  Avoid publicity.



M-F.	We are short of equipmt.  Had to say something.

	Only 37% of peace establmt.  Money cut.  1.1. m. on outbreak : must try to improve recruiting.  But pity Press seized on this aspect.

	No intentn. of using sirens now.



P.M.	True U.S. have carried this v. much further.





		2.	Civil Service : Retiring Age.



P.M.	Wd. have put it – cd. retain after 60 those exceptionally efficient – the other way round.

	Cab. shd. have bn. consulted.  Ques. of timing.  Came oddly after announcemt. of cuts in Service.



R.A.B.	I approved decn. and notified Staff Side – who gave it to Press and incurred undue publicity.  I have demanded, and received, apology.

	Timing was unfortunate.  But policy is right.  Cuts affect temporaries : this affects permanent staff.  Accords with Friday’s motion for extending working life generally.



P.M.	Let me be asked in future wthr. I wish such things brght. to Cab.

	Any executive act of importce. shd. be mentioned in Cab.





		3.	Potato Acreage.



P.M.	Warning in y. Post.  Shortage likely in Mar/April.  Next year acreage likely to fall again because of increased costs and short labour.



W.	M/Ag. announced y’day £5 p. acre ploughing up subsidy.

	This is for crops – incldg. potatoes.  Shd. increase home prodn. of them as well as coarse grains.  Drive to get small-holders to grow potatoes – even in gdns.  Saves imports/wheat.



P.M.	Ready to give short because on potatoes.





		4.	Unemployment in Coventry.



D.S.	Edelman is askg. P.N. Ques. v. dismissals in motor industry in Coventry because of steel shortage.

	Results partly fr. steel allocn.  Putting aircraft sub-contracts in.

	But even as, and even on promise of more steel in 2nd quarter, 1.000 wd. have to be turned off.



O.L.	Area of acute labour shortage.



W.M.	Skilled will be absorbed.  Unskilled may not be, so quickly.



D.S.	Cuts in cars for home market; must mean drop in employment.





		5.	Steel Prices.



P.M.	Had understood addl. U.S. price wd. be only £10.  A.D. says £30-35.

	We haven’t bght. it : only obtained allocn.

	May appeal to Harriman.  We might be heavily criticised.  We must be prepared for that.

	Will report to Cab. on this next week.  Need for care in presntn.



O.L.	Even after paying this price and equalising B. steel will still be £5 below any other producer.

	£11-12 m. will be absorbed out of profits.





		6.	Labour for Re-armament.



W.M.	Now I am constantly under fire v. deferment – esp. agriculture, apprentices export as well as defence).  Apprentices wd. be better employed on their own work.

	M/S. case in para. 4.  Need the team as a whole.  If that were accepted, how resist same demand for export industries.

	Admy. in para. 5.  Together with M/S. totals 1.500.  But shipwrights cover wide range of skills : and demand wd. spread again to export indies.

	Call-up produces needs only by extendg. age.  Encroachment  upon universality will undermine system of comp. training.



P.M.	Cd. defend it – for makg. weapons or raising food.

	Admy. : how many draughtsmen have you got cpd. with pre-war.



J.P.L.T.	Can’t say.  We are 50% short in electrical dept. now.

	Holdg. up carriers and sweepers.  Bottle-neck.



P.M.	Give me special note on this.



A.H.	Share fears of M/L. v universality.

	Since war, industry has had no finished apprentices.  They will start this year – at 16.000 pa.



D.S.	We are now tooling up : moment of maximum need for draughtsmen and apprentices.  Cdn’t absorb unskilled given under priority.

	Getting men out of Forces isn’t as good as keep them on teams.



P.T.	We are short in export industries.  If exemptn given for defence, export indies. will demand some treatment.

	I think 10(c) is the wisest move to make.



A.H.	Call-up won’t meet man power needs in full over next 2/3 yrs.



P.M.	Favour keeping these men out of Forces.



J.S.	Won’t restrict this once you start – eg. agriculture, who are being asked for expanded prodn.

	I wd. much prefer 10(c).



W.M.	I cdn’t hold it if we go beyond 10(c).



L.P.S.	10(c) is right.  10(b) wd. give M/S. a priority over all.



O.L.	10(c).  Designated list – as it worked in last war.



P.M.    	Let W.M. etc. propose what will do least damage to N. Service while mtg. needs of exports and defence (in that order).  Lists.  Matched to steel.  Aim at 15.000.  



H.C.  	No: that wd. wreck it.



W.M.	Designate particular projects and defer only those of highest skill.

	May I work something out, in a week.  Agreed.  L. to preside, as an impartial Chairman.

						[Exit D.S.  J.P.L.T.,  de Lisle



		7.	Malaya.



O.L.	Expedient to keep Macdonald for about 3 more months, under a new directive excludg. him fr. concern with operations.  Wish to announce tomorrow tht. his appointmt. has bn. extended.



P.M.	Wait until Templer has arrived.  Wd. look then as tho’ T. was in favour.



O.L.	Won’t announce w’out further refce. to P.M. or Cab.

		

		Memo. approved.



								[Exit A.H.

		8.	Government Office Accommodation.		[Enter D.E.



D.E.	Giving up a bldg. makes good impn.

	Offl. resistance can’t be overcome w’out help from Ministers.

	Big effort needed to get saving in space to follow saving in staff.

	Want help to enforce existing standards.

	£200.000 pa. spent on filing cabinets.

P.M.	Must be examined.  Can have too much history.  Reserve all Cab. and Ministerial records.



R.A.B.	Support M/W.  Joint offices in provincial towns.



W.M.	We cd. do more as agents of M/N.I.



R.A.B.	Don’t scrap welfare accommn. and don’t go below minimum standards.



L.	M/T. and M/C.A. merger : will come later : and Ariel House will be available – staff being transferred to Acton.  Not so much saving in staff.



E.E.	Eliminate small units.  Will circulate a list.

								[Exit D.E.



		9.	King’s Visit to South Africa.



I.	H.M.’s P.S. was advised to ascertain privately tht. Malan wd. not raise ques. of controversy while King is in S.A.  He did so.  Then H.M. accepted the offer.  All this done w’out formal advice fr. P.M. 

	Brockway M.P. and others now wish to criticise U.K. Govt.  Demand statement there is no pol. significance in the visit.

	I recommend tht. no notice be taken.



P.M.	P.M. of  UK. can’t divest himself of all responsibility – even of offering personal advice.

	Motion in opposite sense has bn. tabled.

	Ready to say I advised in favour.



L.P.S.	Leave it.  People wd. assume you had given formal advice – and that wd. have bn. unconstitutional.



		Agreed : leave it alone.





		





		10.	Housing Subsidy.
