		1.	Imperial Preference.			 [Enter Sw., B-H, G.Br.



P.T.	Read proposed reply to 2 P.Q.’s.

	

	Approved – subject to “as soon as possible” via “at the appr. time.”





		2.	Powers of Minister of Transport.



Sim.	Stat. powers vested in M/T. personally – can’t be exercised by any other persons.  Powers of direction or semi-judicial functions.

	Can’t see any answer to a challenge to any formal direction given while Maclay is ill.



P.M.	Cd. appoint another, who wd. resign when the other is fit to resume duties.





		3.	Road and Rail Transport.



L.	B.T.C. are preparing new scheme : must await it.  Fares outside Ldn(?)

	Have also told Hurcomb about W. Paper : salient points.  No serious re-action or surprise.  Thinks it will be diff. to hold R. Haulage Executive staff – that’s inevitable.  When I asked for his comments, he said it’s settled I presume – nothg. for me to say.



P.M.	I shd. give him W. Paper.  



L. 	I will when it’s settled finally.



L.	Benstead thght this wd. provoke increased wage claims from N.U.R.



P.M.	Are Cab. solidly behind the levy principle?  Assume fr. L. that bulk of assets will be marketable despite this.



R.A.B.	Petrol tax : they will say levy is an additional burden.  This will increase Opposition criticism.



	H.C., O.L., W.M./, M.F., Sw., J.S.  all expressed support for principle at stage, at request.



	Publication of W. Paper : Thursday of next week.	Agreed.



L.	Increased price of meals on trains –  6/= to 8/6d.

	B.T.C. have asked M/T. to authorise this.  Don’t think we need take responsibility for such detail.





		4.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.



R.A.B.	This delays Finance Bill.  But can’t be helped.



H.C.	Can I promise B.B.C. W. Paper for week following?

							[Exit B-H.

		5.	Road Passenger Services.



L.P.	As in memo.



Sim.	Is this consistent with our policy tht. this Cttee shd. consider road/rail competition.  We don’t want to invite hampering of roads to keep rail alive.



O.L.	Insert “passenger”, at beginning of last line of t. of r.



P.M.	Don’t announce this until week after B’casting W. Paper.



L.P.S.	Wd. prefer to omit final phrase – end at “public”.

	Point to stress is differential (greatly increased) betwn. road and rail fares.

		Agreed :	Re-submit on Tuesd. next, amended on lines of 	makg. particular reference to s.72 of R.T. Act, 1930.

		6.	Steel : Strike in U.S.A.



A.E.	U.S. have said they will keep our supplies going and shd. not have to reduce them unless strike is a long one, which they don’t expect it to be.





		7.	Purchase Tax.



R.A.B.	Lancs. members are talking of total abolition of tax.  Assheton has now advocated it last night.  Don’t wish to negotiate with him in his present mood.

	I may be able to get away with concession proposed in memo.



A.E.	Spoke to them at Blackburn and thought they accepted view that no sweeping redn. cd. be made w’out upsetting whole balance of Budget.
