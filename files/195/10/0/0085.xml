		order in Cairo.



P.M.	No need for B. mil. intervention.



S.Ll.	A.E. will want to say no interv. w’out refce home.

		notwithstg. judgment of Hague Ct. tht. it has no jurisdn.



W.M.	Persia accepted jurisdn only as regards Treaties.

	Doesn’t affect rights of Co.



S.Ll.	Tho’ we have sheltered under interim judgmt.



P.M.	Avoid positive answer to-day.  I had better answer.

	Unless we can say firmly tht. we shall continue to stop the oil.





	3.	Parliament.



H.C.	Sat until 3 a.m. – on Isle of Man (Customs) Bill.  I brought business

		to an end, drawg. attn to fact tht. only 20 Labour people were

	Wd like to make a formal protest this p.m.  Threatening need to sit over

		Bank Holiday.



P.M.	Support this.                           Agreed.		[Exit  B-H.





	4.	Commonwealth Economic Conference.



Sal.	Expd time-table.

R.A.B.	Sooner we start, the better.



P.M.	Accept Nov. date.



P.T.	Minl Cttee shd. take the broad decision by end of 1st wk. in 

		August.



Ch.	V. big decisions are at issue.



P.M.	No holidays for Ministers.



S.Ll.	A.E. ready to work at this on Tues. &amp; Wed. &amp; Aug. 2.

	

	Announcement in H/C.



P.M.	I will discuss with R.A.B.

			                                        [Enter  3 Serv. Ministers, D.S.,

				D.E.

	5.	Defence &amp; Economic Policy.



P.M.	Long-term future of defence viz., after 1953.  Can’t be settled at once.

		M/Def. to work at this during 1st 2 wks. of Aug.  Thereafter mtgs.

		of Ministers or Cab. in 2nd half of August.



Al.	Then R.A.B. must not commit future yrs. in what is said in

		debate.



R.A.B.	Can’t have ½ Budget devoted to Defence.  £1800 m. on cutting edge

		&amp; atomic energy etc.  Forces will have to find scope for new

		equipmt. by some re-deploymt.

	Won’t commit Govt. to a definite view for future.

	On civil side – what of cut made in food subsidies, Health Service.

		Also on this round civil investment.

	Whole basis of def. p’mme was burden-sharing – now a fiasco.

		And since then Abadan, terms of trade, no increase in

		productivity.



A.H.	Metals:  ques. of principle is tht. there shd. be some increase.

		On total cost, there cd. be a compensatg. reduction in strengths.

	We cd. keep a re-armament p’mme if principle of increase there

		is accepted.



P.T.	But it is the rise wh. is fatal to expansion of exports.  Deters contractg.

		ahead for civil orders.



P.M.	We are not spending less than the £4.700 m.



Ch.	’51 deficit £500m. in b/p.

	’53 we propose £500 more on def. &amp; more on investmt. deficit

		£1100 m.  Look at that.

de L.	1.100 aircraft &amp; 2.700 jet engines cancellations provided for in

		this plan.

	More cancellns if £500 ceiling.



J.T.	Admy wd. have to cut frigates.



D.S.	Real conflict betwn. expandg. exports &amp; m’taing. defence in 

		engineering industry.

	We can only look at this on 3 yr. basis.  And that will determine

		expre in ’53.  Must do the 3 yrs. first.



P.M.	Need not announce precisely in debate.  Better to avoid precision.



de L.	You can’t get the new types unless there is a rising curve in metal-use.



Ch.	Do you suggest tht. £450 m. all goes on maintenance?



P.M.	*Let us see division betwn. m’tenance &amp; new equipmt.*

	May be better to have a smaller Force with new equipmt.



A.H.	1953.  C.O.S. memo.   Metals.   New      50.24.

			                                  M’ten.   35.64.

	Metals cut falls on relatively small field.

	We accept ’53 decision.  The diffy arises fr. ceiling thereafter.

		Industry will go over to exports &amp; we won’t get the capacity.



Sw.	There won’t be the metal to carry thro’ both jobs.



Al.	Then global str. &amp; A.E.’s memo go by the board.



de L.	150 squadrons now.



P.M.	Then cut no. of squadrons &amp; get the new equipmt.  Army too:

		have fewer men &amp; better weapons.



A.H.	What will A.E. say on commitments.



de L.	And go back on N.A.T.O.



Al.                *	Must ask C.O.S. to review strategy on basis of smaller forces.



A.H.	Even if we start lower we must have a rising curve.



Sal.	Agree tht. no plan can be made on a flat ceiling rate.



P.M.	Can’t avoid some increase in met. on new equipmt. in ’54 because 

		orders placed.

	Can seek compensatg. economies in m’tenance.



D.S.	If size of Forces is m’tained, any cut in metal use will fall on new

		weapons.



Al.	Will examine over next 2 mos. the minimum increase poss. in metal-

		using industries.  There must be some.



R.A.B.	May Accept that offer.  But we must recognise tht. it may be 

		even more serious.  We can’t afford all the services we are 

		trying to keep – incldg. social services.



D.S.	Must have decns w’in 6wks.  Can get along until then.

	But make all the cut at once blow – not bit by bit, wh. is devastatg.

		to industry.



S.Ll.	A.E. wants to see 3 yr. p’mme for other services at same time, if

		def. is to be trimmed over 3 years.
