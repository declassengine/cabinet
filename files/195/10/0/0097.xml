C.M. 87 (52)					21st October, 1952



1.	    By-Elections.

				 [Enter Sw. &amp; B-H.



P.M.	H. Wycombe is so important tht. we shd waive normal rule r. Ministers’ spkg. at by-elections.



H.C.	There will be others as important – 1500 majority.  Rule may disappear.

	Ministers can’t attend H/C now save when on specific duty.  This wd. draw them away from H/C. even more.



P.M.	Selectivity (of occasion) is possible.



M-F.	If we lose H.Wycombe + prs. Bury our majority wd. be vulnerable.  Our posn is so serious tht. we shd. breach the genl. rule for this.



R.A.B.	No rule:  not too many shd. go.  Selectivity (of persons also).



O.L.	M’tain genl. rule, but make this an exception.



P.M.	One wd. be enough.



			Agreed:  One to go. – exceptionally, w’out prejudice to 		               genl. rule.



Sw.	B’cast during period of election.



B-H.	One in every 3 months.



P.M.	Don’t devote one to by-election – or mention it, when M/H. b’casts as arranged on 30/10.



Sw.	Risk that Labour wd. claim right of reply &amp; get in just ahead of election.



B.H.	They cd. ask for another:  you can have as many as you like in one quarter, but must have one.

					       [Exit B-H.

					       [Enter Att. G.

2.	    Judges Salaries.



Sim.	Ques. is one of method.

	Prefer either additional £1,000 free of tax.

	                 or provn tht. part of existg. salary be free of tax.



R.A.B.	Recognise need to help judges.

	But posn isn’t easy.

	If we give tax-free allowance, it can’t be based on expenses – without a wangle, wh. Judges cd. not tolerate.

	Legn providg. for tax-free [m’tenance] allowance = £1.000 of existg. salary.  They wd. be sole exceptn.  Even Royalties put up a schedule of expenses to justify the concession.  Judges cdn’t do this.  Revenue dislike this:  doubt if Judges (who have to adjudicate on tax law) wd. like this invidious posn.

	Compromise:  increase of salary plus a larger allowance for expenses.

 

O.L.	Original £5,000 was designed to insulate them fr. all worries &amp; exclude corruption.  “Expenses” are irrelevant.  I wd. vote a straight £2.000 tax free in addn to salary as recognition that he is apart from all.



R.A.B.	Equivalent to £35.000 p.a. gross.  Pretty steep.



P.M.	Cd. Opposn query it after Dalton’s decision on Attlee’s salary.

	Judges are above everyone – in a position by themselves.

	The reward for this – unblemished reputation of the English Bench.  A national asset.  Wd. be damaged if Judges were forced back into practice at the Bar.

	If we are to do this at all, make a job of it on basis of “unique” argument.

	Prefer to declare a portion (£2.000) of existg. salary free of tax – if necessary by legislation.  Make a decent job of it.



R.A.B.	Wd. reverse 100 years of Revenue practice.

	1825 Judges’ salaries were free of tax.  They have paid tax since Peel’s income tax was introduced.



Sw.	Legn wd. meet the Revenue point.



Sim.	I wd. be happier if it were done by legn.



P.M.	Let Sim. consult draftsman re form of Bill.



R.A.B.	[Cd. I discuss with Sim alternatives of first £1.000 to be tax-free.]

	

			General sense of Cabinet:  let first £2.000 be tax-free by 	legn.

			Sim. and R.A.B. to consult together on details, and inform 	P.M.

-	or rather submit a plan to Cabinet.



M.F.	J.S. reserves posn of Sc. Judges.  Wants to raise ques of parity with English Bench as well as the tax-free addition.



P.M.	I favour pro rata treatment, but not parity.

					[Exit Att.G.



3.	    Borrowing by Local Authorities.



H.M.	Have discussed with R.A.B.  Am content with statement he proposes to make – meets all my fears.  A few l.a.’s may go to the market.

But control over l.a. expenditure will be kept to Cab.



R.A.B.	Shall wish to limit the amount in next Budget.  But can say nothg. about this until time of Budget.



P.M.	Rates a/c for £700-1.000m.  They shd. live w’in that &amp; not sponge on Exchequer.

						[Exit H.M.

			Memo. approved.





4.	    Tourist Allowance.



R.A.B.	M’tain it at £25 but alter age for children.

	Mght. be able to raise it later in year.  But unwise to do it now.



					            [Enter D.E.

5.	    Kenya.



O.L.	Arrests began with arrival of 1st contingent of Lancs Regt.

	Aim:  arrest 138 people.  Haven’t heard how many are in.

	31/2 Battn of K.A.R. are available, in addn to Lancs. Regt.

	Thanks to M/D. &amp; mil. commn.



Al.	Paratroops:  cdn’t be done because all aircraft in other use.



O.L.	Trouble confined so far to Kikuyu.





6.	    Preservation of Historic Buildings.



D.E.	As in memo.  Powers now confined to uninhabited houses.

	Cd. make a start with money Ty. offer.  M/W. wd. do houses unoccupied: Nat. Trust those wh. are occupied.



R.A.B.	Wd. wish to discuss Bill with M/W.  For Chatsworth mght. be covered – thro’ Land Fund.  Appeal pending on death duties.



P.M.	Art collection shd. not be dispersed.



R.A.B.	Devonshire won’t do that w’out consultg. Ty.



Sal.	Waverly’s Cttee (has now reported).  If Ty. tells you can’t export to U.S. &amp; puts arbitrary value on the object – there’s no free market by wh. to judge what is right.



D.E.	V. short Bill &amp; non controversial.



R.A.B.	Opposn want it.



			Memo. approved.

			D.E. to consult R.A.B.





7.	    Coronation.



P.M.	Shd. we not meet some of reasonable criticisms in Press.

		a) What about cutting out Embankmt. procession.



D.E.	This was done in return for asking Queen to come back down Mall Route is shorter than Geo. V. but longer than Geo VI.

	Wd. myself prefer to suggest to Queen tht. she alters arrival route to include Embankment (10 more minutes &amp; 600 yds.)



P.M.	b) Choice of day.



D.E.	Too late now to alter it.



P.M.	c) Set out 4 or 5 criticisms &amp; set out our reasons for decns taken.

To remind ourselves &amp; assist in answering ques.



D.E.	Platforms in front of stand – to increase nos. who can stand and see.



P.M.	d) Ready to re-consider decision on television.  We govern by popular will.



Sw.	No explanation given in Earl Marshal’s announcement.

	No objn on grounds of sanctity – Vatican was televised, incldg. Holy Week.



H.C.	What new facts to warrant change of mind?



Al.	Disappointmt of public.



Sal.	Archbishop must be consulted.



			Agreed:  Cttee to consider this and other points.

						  [Exit D.E.



8.	    Use of Troops to Maintain Essential Services.



			Agreed:  renew powers under D Regs. &amp; p’pone making 	them.







9.	    Wages:  Engineering Industry.



W.M.	Talks are in progress.
