			                       [Enter  Sw., de L., J.T., D.E., F. Horsbrugh

	1.	Coronation.



	(a)	Naval Review.

P.M.	£10.000 for water:  v. excessive.  Charge cd. be made for accommn

		in liner.



J.T.	Ready to cut our Govt. entertaining.



P.M.	No:  provn must be made for Govt. guests, but on day before &amp; after

		people can pay.



Sal.	Doubtful if there is a day left for it, on which Queen cd. attend.



	*P.M.	{  Let us have Review, but Admy must do it cheaper.

			{  Sal. to verify tht. day is available wh. suits the Queen.



	(b)	R.A.F. Review.

de L.	Mildenhall.  Nothing in estimate for oil.

		Fencing, lavs., camp for ground-staff £8.000.  Subsistence &amp; 

		rations £7.000.  Entertment - £1.000.



P.M.	Consider a charge, to offset expenses.  Submit detailed plan, at lower

		cost.



Sal.	Doubt, again, if Queen can find a day.  I will consider that.

		

		Approved (both) in principle, subject to Queen’s pleasure

			&amp; revised estimate of cost.



	(c)	Decorations off Route.

D.E.	Many more Govt. bldgs. in provinces:  must cost more than it did

		before.  Don’t favour cuttg. Ldn exp’re in order to find money for 

		them.  But are Cab. willing tht. Govt bldgs. shd. be bare cpd. 

		with l.a. bldgs.



	(d)	Education Authority Expenditure.

F.H.	Gifts to children.  “Reasonable expense” last time.  Suggested limit of 		2/6 p. head:  possibly 2/= wd. do.	Agreed.	2/=



Sal.	Even 2/= limit might cost £360.000 on Exchequer – prob. not more

		than £½ m. in fact.



	(e)	Seating in Abbey.

Sim.	N. wants 880 for H/L. and 650 for H/C. as minima approved at once.

		He can’t delay some announcement of Dom. seats – or some

		approach to Houses on method.



D.E.	I have submitted my views to P.M. – 650 is too low a limit for H/C.		Wd cause v. great trouble.



P.M.              *	M/W., Sal., H.C., B.H. and Sim. to study and make report, consultg.		D.E.’s memo.	Agreed.



	(f)	Prices of Seats.

B-C.	Want to say £4 &amp; £6 (P.Q. to-day) tho’ it prob. won’t cover cost in

		full.  



B-C.	Mght. put cost up by another £100.000.



D.E.	I cd. sell more seats to agencies at profit.



P.M.	You must be self-supporting.	Agreed.



D.E.	Agreed.  Stand on £4 &amp; £6 &amp; make profit elsewhere.



D.E.	Have also to say how we are distributg. seats in Govt. stands.

		Previously, Nat. Govt. refused to say (prob. because they had

		given too many to Co-ops.).  Avoids argument to keep mum.



P.M.	Follow precedent &amp; avoid controversy.  Say which bodies, but not how 

		many seats to each.

					[Exit  F.H., J.T.

					[Enter  L-B.

	2.	Gatwick Airport.



L-B.	There are misgivings.  But case for alternate airport is overwhelming –

		because increasg. load of air traffic.  Seven Ldn. airports wd. be

		reduced to 3 under this plan.  Mght. be wise to present W. Paper

		on future airport policy for Ldn. area – demonstratg. savings

		(£400.000 p.a. on the 4 to be dropped), also helicopter 

		possibilities.  Let Cab. consider, on basis of a draft W. Paper.

		Cab. can then understand &amp; public be informed.  If outcry in

		Gatwick continues, local enquiry cd. be held limited to the 

		local issues.



P.M.	Why not go to desolate, distant spot &amp; use helicopters to come in.



L.B.	10/15 yrs. before any large nos. can be moved by helicopter.  Certainly

		can’t use them for 2nd class traffic.  Wd deal with that ques. in

		W. Paper.



L.	Gatwick is unique qua fog free.



H.M.	Can’t hold local enquiry until national policy is establd



de  L.	Wish to be consulted.	[Exit  de L., L-B.

				[Enter  A.S., Ll.G., T.D.

	3.	Marketing of Eggs.



Ll.G.	25% of available eggs go to black market.  No alternative but to free

		market.  W’in 12 mos. for wh. M/F. continues to control 

		imported eggs we must work out permanent scheme for 

		marketing eggs.  Wdn’t free it until spring, when more eggs.



J.S.	M/H. wishes to be assured of adequate supplies for maternity &amp; other

		priority classes.  May he be consulted?



Ll.G.	Yes:  but we can’t do much for them, w’out complex priority scheme.



T.D.	Favour de-control.  But new factor:  B/T. uncertain wtr. support price

		scheme can be operated.  In announcg. we must assure farmers

		tht. price &amp; market guarantees will be preserved:  will discuss 

		long-term:  promise tht. imports can be controlled when Govt.

		purchase is dropped.  W’out assurance, our prodn cd. v. rapidly

		drop by 50%.



P.T.	Diffy in controllg. imports because G.A.T.T. etc.  B/T. shd. consult

		with M/F. and M/Ag. on ways &amp; means before announcement

		made.



A.S.	De-rationing can be announced.  It is before assurance is given to 

		farmers tht. this point must be thrashed out.



Sal.	Heavy imports fr. Eire &amp; Austr. - &amp; we have agreemts. to take all 

		they can provide.  C.R.O. shd. be associated with it.



P.M.	Promise a full statement in November &amp; work it out m’while – incldg.

		all the supplementaries wh. will be asked.  Ty. to come in on

		consultns.	Agreed.





	4.	Christmas Food Bonuses.



J.S.	M/Food can put a good case.



P.M.	If R.A.B. &amp; M/F. agree, I can oppose it no more.

			

			Memo. approved.





	5.	Meat:  Argentine Negotiations.



Ll.G.	Austr. supplies are better &amp; I cd. hold ration of ⅛ until March even 

		w’out Argentine meat.  Amb. wd. like this announced, as weapon

		in negotiations.  Thus, I don’t want now to announce 1/9 for

		meat.



Sw.	Wd rather you had plus &amp; minus together.
