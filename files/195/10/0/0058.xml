C.C. 44(52)							22nd April 1952



		1.	Road and Rail Transport.	[Enter B-H., Maclay., Sw., D.S.



H.C.	“ever since assuming office” in line 1.



P.M.	Para. 14 shd. be omitted.  I don’t admit tht. rlways must in all circs. pay their way.  With need to pay fixed interest on stock.  Rlways can’t be left dead-weight on our internal transport system.  This would sabotage productivity.  Can’t all be done by increased fares.



	“Operation in restraint of trade” to force people to pay more for rlways and keep them off the roads.



M-F.	This para. doesn’t raise that major issue.  It merely promises to give rlways greater freedom in the matter of statutory rates.  What we want is to avoid old rigidities in charges qua common carrier.



P.M.	Then accept amendmt. of para. 14 written into my copy.



R.A.B.	This policy won’t solve the problem.  4’s biased in favour of roads.

	Will cripple rlways.  But necessary if we are to fulfil our pre-election pledges.

	Wd. help me if you omitted the figure of £3 m. for the levy.



O.L.	Say : “The amount of the levy will be sufficient to amortise over a period of x years the losses incurred by the Commn.”



P.M.	Date of presentation.  Must be in Vote Off. by Thurs. pm. if available for Monday’s debate.  If issued, this will be subject of debate.

	If not, Party wrangle about fares.

	Wd. prefer to lift it to a higher plane.  



A.E. 	So would I.



Sw.	Wd. clash on Fri. with Farm Prices.  Publish Sat. am.



R.A.B.	Prior discussion with B.T.C. (L. and T.U.’s) wd. be v. helpful.



P.M.	They won’t help.  Cd. be consulted before introdn. of Bill.



	M.F. and R.A.B. to put up revised draft of paras. on levy.

	Cab. to resume consn. them.

	Debate on Mon, on Motion.

	Levy : compromise on £4 m.  Must give a figure in debate.
