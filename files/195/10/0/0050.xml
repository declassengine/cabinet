C.C. 36(52)							3rd April 1952



		1.	Transport.  Scottish Bus Services. [Enter Sw., B-H and Maclay



P.M.	Concerned at this suppression of private enterprise – wh. has bn. under cutting rlways.

	D. Mirror article is a masterly exposn of Tory views – so is News Chronicle.

	How did this happen?  And why wasn’t Cab. told in advance?



Macl.	N. Roadways applied last yr. for licence under 1930 Act : granted by an independent licensing authy.  Act provides for appeal.  Co-operated pending hearing of large no. of appeals.  Heard in Nov ’51, Edinb. by M/T. Inspr. appointed under statute.  Report received in Feb. by M/T. recommending revocation.  Appellants : rlways., B.T.C. long distance cos, Ribble Motor Co. and some others (with 56% priv. ownership by B.El. Traction).



	Many such cases.  This decision followed precedent in case law.

	All we didn’t know was that Co. had made fwd. bookings throughout summer, despite appeal pending.



P.M.	Read articles from D. Mirror.



Macl.	This Co. had never operated this type of service until last spring.



W.M.	You can’t alter policy by one case.  Estabd principle of 1930 Act is to exclude new entrants where sufft. services are already available.  This is a broad problem which needs to be tackled as one of principle.



Macl.	Cases of this kind come up every week.

	Major decision irrevocable.



P.T.	Since 1930 rlways have bn. sustained by cutting out this kind of competition.  Cdn’t take contrary line on an individual case.



P.M.	If we had known in advance, M/T. reasons cd. have bn. publicised.



H.C.	This sort of criticism is inevitable while we administer old Acts before we can introduce amending legisln.



P.M.	Cd. you let them carry on during summer?



Macl.	Am asking licensing authy. what period of grace he can allow.



L.	Wh. Paper leaves 1930 Act intact.  Doesn’t affect road passenger services.



L.P.S.	In H/L. unstarred Ques. gives scope for a small debate.  I cd. provoke one on this ques. and L. cd. reply : next week.

Macl.	P.Q. in H/C. on Monday.



P.M.	Principle : lieges shd. have chance of choosing easiest and cheapest mode of transport.



M-F.	1930 Act was designed to protect rlways.  And Tory Govts. used it for  8 yrs. pre-war.

	We must review 1930 Act – and the Ty. proposal tht. levy shd. extend to coaches.



W.M.	Before 1930 there was excessive competn. and overcrowding on roads.



			Agreed	  i)  M/T. to try to extend l.a. discretionary

				      period for winding up these cos.



				 ii)  Transport Cttee to consider coaches.

		

								[Exit Macl.

		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Statement will leave it open to propose a compulsory time table for N.H. Bill.



R.A.B.	Opposn. want Fin. Bill on Wed vice Mon.

	A long and diff. Bill.  Don’t want to spoil atmosphere.  Wd. like to meet them.



		Agreed :   R.A.B. to tell H.G. tht. Fin. Bill must be on Monday.





		3.	B.B.C. Monopoly.				[Enter P.M.G.



L.P.	Much controversy.  Some people have strong views on principle.  I haven’t.

	Can get agreemt. in Tory Party on basis indicated in memo. viz., leave B.B.C. as at now but undertake to allow one competitor on television when capital investmt. position allows.  Party won’t ask for another sound b’casting organn.

	Proposed in para.(2) put fwd. by our own supporters.

	These proposals are supported by B’casting Cttee.



R.A.B.	Wd. sooner leave television proposal optional.



L.P.	Need only say tht if there is a demand for it, it will be conceded.



L.P.S.	Who licenses the competitor?  What is meaning of last sentence of para.(2)?  



L.P. 	Body under (2) have to appoint a licensg. authy.  

L.P.S.  	I wd. much prefer P.M.G. to license.



M-F.	Not suggd. that P.M.G. shd. not licence.  The other body wd. be concerned with “standards”.

	Party won’t accept anything wh. doesn’t make a specific proposal for breaking the monopoly.



B.H.	At least 70% favour brkg. the monopoly.



R.A.B.}	B.B.C. will demand the 15% of revenue which we are at present 

P.M.G.}	w’holding.



P.M.	Cd. we p’pone for another 10 mos.?  Public opinion is forming still.



L.P.	I asked our H/C. people not to join in newspp. controversy.  They have held back tho’ they feel v. strongly.



		Agreed :  White Paper to be produced, for Cab. discn. on

			     basis of C.99.

							[Exit P.M.G.



	4.	





CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000



							[Enter Ll.G. and T.D.



		5.	Farm Price Review.



L.P.	Reported interview with farmers.



T.D.	Agreed now tht. net income to be earned in current year = £296½ m.

	Farmers want prices wh. will increase that.

	Cab. have accepted some increase.  Ques : how much?  My view : some global figure must be fixed before discn. of price schedules begins.

	So far we have said £50 m. recoupmt.

	Better now to put it on net income.  Offer £310 m. vice £296½ m.

	This wd. mean another £4½ m. added to the £9.  This wd. be the same as P.M.’s figure of £54 m.



Ll.G.	Gap now = £13 m. betwn. us and them.

	Excessive recoupmt. on milk must be reduced.  Y’day’s discussion proved 200% recoupment on milk is what farmers aim at.  Will mean over prodn. and increase in subsidy.  We cd. cut £10 m. off milk and eggs in public interest.  If we don’t, farm workers will demand wage increases and prob. will get them (12/= a week).



T.D.	We will come back to Cab. on schedules if I disagree with M/F.  But I must have a global figure today.



R.A.B.	These addns. will all go on to consumer, in food prices. Budget allowed for £45 m. only.  At £54 (9m. wd. go on to consumer.)  If we put fertiliser on direct grant, it will be rumbled as unrealistic.

	V. diff. to justify anything more than £50-£51 m.

	Turner admitted y’day tht. his claim included £13 m. of capital injection.



Ll.G.	Danger of over-production of milk.



P.M.	V. ugly.  Shall be said to have squared our pol. supporters at expense of consumers.  Will stimulate wage increases and the spiral.

	Don’t think we shd. be blackmailed or bullied – unduly.

	Support R.A.B.

	Offer settlement at £52 m. or nothing?



Sim.	I wd. be tough with them.				[Exit A.E.



		Agreed :  £50 for imposed : but liberty to go up to £52½ m. to 		    get a settlement and cut down recoupment on milk.



								[Exit Ll.G., T.D.

		6.	Egypt : Sterling Balances.



R.A.B.	Urged release of £10 m. to forestall retaliation.

	A.E. supports this.



Ch.	Why shdn’t E. deposit dollars v. this?



R.A.B.	They have refused – tel. of 31/3.

	V. unusual thing to do : confidence in sterling : not now a ques. of murders etc. a difft. Govt.



P.M.	V. well.  Have still a bigger fin. weapon in reserve.

	As R.A.B. and A.E. want it, I will agree.
