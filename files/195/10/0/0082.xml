C.C. 69 (52)					15th July, 1952



1.	    Iron &amp; Steel Bill.

			                                                          [Enter Sw., D.S., B-H.



P.M.	Saw Ellis Hunter, with Sal – he said he didn’t want a Wh. Paper.

Time-table had altered sitn:  Bill to come on in Nov. vice next spring. He wd. therefore be content with decln of Govt’s intention to press on with Bill – spkg. from industrial pt. of view.

	My view:  Wh. Paper wd. be less vehement than such a statement.

But let us see what the statement wd. be.



Sal.	Prefer a firm statement tht. we intend to go with de-natn, but no mention of date.  Don’t care how strong the statement is, if no promise were made of early introdn.



O.L.	Leave loophole for agreemt.  But think you shd. say it’s coming in this year.  Won’t satisfy industry w’out that.  Imply tht., if no agreemt. reached, Bill will come in Nov.



P.M. 	A.E. (telephone) unwilling to abandon plan:  but ready to discuss statement vice W. Paper – on Tuesday next, when he will be here.

	Think W. Paper wd. be easier.  Attlee etc. know we have one &amp; intended to publish.  Will be said we have changed our minds.  We shall be probed on this on Thursday, I expect.

Talk in Fin. Times this a.m. seems well-informed.

	Plan for announcemt. on 24/7.

	Order of W. Paper cd. be reversed.



J.S.	Enough to declare intentn to legislate on Steel at earliest poss. date.  Not keen on W. Paper.



D.S.	E.Hunter to-day says no longer attaches same importce to W. Paper – so long as Govt. confirm tht. Bill will be introduced this year.

He isn’t against publn.

	But consider too wtr. publn will help twds. agreed solution.  I think we must have a basis for discn.  If we wait until Bill comes out, we have less room to manoeuvre.  Corpn won’t take initiative in makg. proposals unless we first publish ours.  I favour publn with indicn of readiness to consider constructive comment.



P.M.	Failg. agreemt. betwn. pol. Parties, we must restore pr. ownership.

	But if we can take steel out of politics, that wd. be a price worth paying – esp. if we have tried &amp; failed to sell.



Sw.	Ques. of tactics – how best to seek agreemt.  Bad to take up positions before beginning to negotiate.  Refer statement to W. Paper.



P.M.	No compromise likely wh. will win support of Labour.

          {   *	Re-draft W. Paper in reverse order.

          {	Prepare draft of statement   *M-F., H.M. to day &amp; D.S. – consultg. Sal

          {	&amp; H.C. to-morrow.

          {	Consider on 22/7 which we shall do – in A.E.’s presence.



Sal.	I accept that plan.



H.C.	So do I.



O.L.	Statement must say legn will be introduced this autumn.



H.M.	Yes.





2.	     Parliament.

					       [Enter S.Ll



S.Ll.	Repns fr. Opposn, incldg. visit from Attlee, in favour of p’poning debate until after Recess.  Wd. result in Labour Party voting v. ratification. Delay wd. allow them to influence socialists in Europe.

	But C.R.A. cdn’t guarantee better vote in Oct.

	Lab. Party Conf. m’while, &amp; that might make it more diff. for Oppn in Oct.

	Effect in Europe R. wd. seek to take advantage of delay.  And Adenaur wants to ratify in Sept.

	A.E. therefore recommends debate before end/July.



P.M.	Support A.E.’s view.



H.C.	Had suggd 2-day debate in Govt time.  But now we cd. give only 1 day &amp; allow Opposn to use Supply Day as a second.



M-F.	Reason:  Licensing in New Towns – read 2nd in Feby:  went to Cttee upstairs:  now session is to end earlier we can’t meet Labour plans to sabotage Bill.  Can’t get it thro’ Cttee before end/July.  Urgent – 

i)	only de-natl measure introduced:  shdn’t abandon it.

ii)	J.S. &amp; I have to deal with this &amp; can’t leave Dev. Corpn in uncertainty for another 9 mos.

	Must therefore have guillotine motion for Cttee &amp; remaining stages.



P.M.	Days btwn. 14/10 and 31/10.  



M-F.	Must go thro’ H/Lds., as well as Rpt &amp; 3rd Rdg.



H.L.	This means using 1 of the 2 days earmarked for Germany.



P.M.	Opposn won’t be content with 1 day on G. 



H.C.	Then they can use Supply Day., until 9.30 on second day.



S.Ll.	Several agreements to discuss:  needs more than one day.



P.M.	Full day on last Fri.  Adjournment on Saty.  And wind it up.

	Tell Opposn we will do that unless they give Supply Day.



H.C.	First time we have had time-table in Cttee upstairs under Tory Govt.





3.	    Friends’ World Conference.



P.M.	Read Minute from M-F.



Ch.	Support F.O. view, on atomic point.



W.M.	Pretty stiff if there is nothg. r. him.



R.A.B.	H.O. tradition of fairness shd. be upheld.



Sal.	V. provocative to send him:  surely they cd. send someone else.



H.C.	Respectable old Quaker.



P.M.	Why not let him come, but decline to see his son.



Alex.	Don’t admit him if there’s anything doubtful.



L.P.	Admit, but refuse permn to see his son.



Ch.	* Believe he went into R. Zone after his son was convicted.



P.M. 	Check * &amp; bring up on Thursday.

			                                                         [Enter Ll.G., G.Ll., T.D.



4.	Import Cuts.



R.A.B.	Food.	Wheat, flour £9.2m  agreed with M/F.

Coarse grains:  want £7.5m.  Don’t press the extra £3m.

	M/F. has some suggns wh. wd. bring us to £127.7m.  That wd. close gap assumg. waiver.  Gives us no margin.



Ll.G.	Started on basis of no redn in consumptn levels.  Followg. would not.

Wheat:  strategic risk – 10 wks in March.

Coarse grains: both to go beyond £3.0m. in a state of siege.

	Further savings

			{ Butter 1m. which I can’t get anyway.

       *	£4.2m	{ Quotas for biscuits, canned oranges fr. Formosa wh.

			{ we can supply for Australia. 

	£8.5m.  Argentine meat – we can’t get all we hoped to buy.

	With these cd. offer £34m.



Al.	Does this mean no strategic stock of wheat.



Ll.G.	13.3 at end/March.  Proposed now to reduce to 10 wks.  Risky.



Sal.	Spare Canadians in this.  Let cut fall on U.S. wheat.



R.A.B.	Coarse grains – must ask for £7.5.



T.D.	Incompatible with agric. expansion.  Wrecks long-term prospect.

False argument tht. some rations aren’t being taken up:  these are people who grow more of their own:  others press for more.  For rationing is on ’39 basis:  means a man can’t have any if no pigs on his land in ’39.

	Accept £3.m:  cdn’t risk more.



R.A.B.	And I cdn’t risk less.



Ch.	Much bigger risk over dollar reserves.



R.A.B.	M/F. can’t meet me on bacon, eggs or rice.



P.T.	Is * a saving?  Established quota.  



Ll.G.	Not available.

	Rice. £2m.  Why deprive ourselves of 35.000 t. out of 2m. shortage in India.  Nor do Indians eat this (polished) rice.

	Eggs &amp; bacon wd. mean real redn in diet – and trouble with Denmk.



P.M.	May be more coal as year goes on.

	The £175m. is only an estimate.

	Cut in coarse grain stops developmt. of food wh. wd. help you next year.

	We cd. get dollar economies by cutting F.O. staffs.



S.Ll.	10 times the size of ’39 in U.S. &amp; France.



P.M.	And Br. Council, too.



L.P.	Coarse grain:  want to build a stock in order to de-ration.



R.A.B.	Saving of £8.5m. on Argentine meat this year is on basis of buying more next year.  I shall have to say he must find compensating cuts in other foods.



Ch.	Are we raising our export prices to Argentine.



P.T.	Where we can.



L.	But can’t put up coal because up to U.S. price.



H.M.	Truman has identified our double squeeze – U.S. won’t by our goods or allow us to trade beyond Curtain.



P.M.	Those are points to be taken with new U.S. Govt.  If they won’t buy from us, we must cut defence further.

	I’m against larger cut than £3m. on coarse grains.



R.A.B.	£7.5m was a compromise.  I asked for £10m.



P.M.	New procedure.  Accept £800m. as target.  Give this a trial.



P.T.	Yes.  But must give warning tht. B/T. has not got complete control over imports.  Will do our best.



O.L.	You can’t control, while £ is at artificially high level.



Ll.G.	I can control:  that’s why I’m beaten about so much.



P.T.	Complete control over dollar imports:  but elsewhere not 100% control thus I can’t guarantee to keep w’in a ceiling.



P.M.	It must be a target, not a ceiling.

	And we must see what is involved.



R.A.B.  	{Wheat £9.2m.  Argentine meat £8.5m.

	{£1m. on butter: £3-2m. on miscell. = £4.2m incldg.                	        butter.



H.C.	What announcement?



Sim.	Materials cuts – much already told to trade.



H.M.	Not “cuts”:  w’holdg. consent for larger p’mmes.
