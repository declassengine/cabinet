C.C. 29(52)							12th March 1952



		1.	The Budget.



P.M.	Congratns.  Re-actions of City?



R.A.B.	City concerned re Bank rate – but external as well as internal advantages.



A.	Batt is v. pleased.  Will help U.S.A. in W’ton.





		2.	The Cabinet.



P.M.	V. grieved to lose Ismay for N.A.T.O.

	Will be of advantage to U.K.

	To be announced tomorrow.



A.E.	Unan. demand for B. subject.

	Round of applause for Ismay.  All are delighted.



P.M.		Salisbury to be S of S.  C.R. – as well as Leader of H/Lords.

		Cabinet not to be increased.  Swinton to be constant attender for H/L. 		business.





		3.	Deferment of Ex. Apprentices.     [Enter 3 Serv. Mins. and M/S.



L.		Shd. Victorious be included – v. long term affair.



D.S.		More restricted plan.  Wd. like extension – electricians and aero. 			engine fitters.  Total nos. under this plan 750 : with my addns. 1.000 or 		1.050.

		Details discussed with other Ministers.



W.M.		Accept Victorious if Admy. will resist extension to private yards.

		D.S. extension depends on Services : if they don’t want them, I’m 			ready for them to be deferred.



J.T.		Victorious.  Will resist demand of private yards.  V. is holdg. up other 		work at P’south.



P.M.		Importance of aircraft.



D.		We favour deferment : on balance, wd. rather have these men in 			industry via R.A.F.



A.H.		We agreed memo. on basis tht. it stood firm.  D.S. at once asks for 			more.  New list contains many on electronics : we shall have to call 		most of those up because we need them.

	

		Will these men be called up after 2 yrs. (para. 7) or not (para. 3).



W.M.		Cases will be considered after 2 yrs.



D.S.		If they think they will be called then, they will prefer to go early.

		Don’t ask for firm promise, however.



W.M.		Doubt that, on experience.

		Para. 3 is important because must see they stay on the jobs.



		Agreed :  Memo. approved plus additions of M/S.



						[Exit 3 Serv. Mins and D.S.

						[Enter Sw. and Ll.G.



		4.	Exports of Rubber to Russia.



P.T.		As in memo.  Hold it to 80.000 t. p.a.  Our bargaining posn. is not 			strong with ½ m. tons of coarse grain outstanding and R. holding 			correctly to contracts.



A.E.		Awkward qua. U.S. opinion.

		56.000 t. last year.  Yet 60.000 this quarter.  Will raise a big row in 		U.S.



		Accept B/T. proposal – tho’ unhappy about carry-over fr. 1951.

		(This is R. b’mail.  Later in ’52 they will press us to go beyond 			80.000).



		Warn Cab. of U.S. re-actions.  Tell U.S. what we are doing and 			promise firm tht. whole year won’t exceed 80.000 t.



Ch.		Will last year’s backlog of 18.000 (licensed but not shipped) be 			allowed this year?



P.T.		Diff. to deny it to them.

		Stick to 80.000 figure.  Tho’ it means 80.000 + 24 for 1952.

		Shd. have to ship balance in next quarter.



A.E.		They are not in excess of quote of coarse grains.



P.M.		Hold up shipments and push some into 2nd quarter.



L.		P’mme of shipping laid on.  Have R. bn. given assurance tht. they can 		collect it.



R.A.B.      	x/.	License the 9.000 t. as allocn. for 2nd quarter.  Delay ships 			accordingly.



P.T.		Rubber bought, but licence not yet issued.

		May we do x/.  Then discuss with A.E. and L. better arrangemts. for 		the future to prevent bunching of shipments.



Ll.G.		350.000 t. of c. grains due by end/March.



R.A.B.		U.S. have swallowed this “backlog” shipment.  Avoid the 9.000 addl. 		in this quarter.



P.M.		And explain to U.S. clearly and at once.



L.P.S.		Non sterling?



P.T.		For 1952 is it 80.000 or 104.000.

		U.S. have accepted all backlog save 6.000.  We cd. hold that back for 		decn. late in the year.



A.E.		Diff. to explain backlog to U.S. people, even tho’ U.S. Govt. have 			accepted 18.000 of it.



R.A.B.		But grains is vital.  Mustn’t lose that.



P.T.		(This years’ total : U.S. Govt. understand it will be 80 + 18.

		(But further 6 can be held in suspense until year end.

		(This quarter.  Don’t licence the 9.000 until after ¼.



Ch.		Tell R. we can’t licence more than this 9.000 for some time.



							[Exit Ll.G.

		5.	Germany.



A.E.		Important advance on anythg. R. has offered.  Due to Lisbon success.

		Adenauers’ reaction is tough.

		New feature : measure of G. re-armament.

		Clever move.  May also be sincere.  Sensible fr. R. angle.

		Seen U.S. Amb.  Will see him and Fr. Amb. jointly this pm.

		My view : go on with existg. plans (E.D.C. and contractual).  Negotns. 		shd finish in 6 wks.  If we are at signing stage by Apl. we shall be 			deeply commd. to that solution – tho’ not finally until ratificn.

		Thought it wd. appeal to G. qua. unity : but A. is not deceived.

		Thinks it’s due to nearness of final agreemt. on E.D.C. etc.

		Nearer still to that agreemt. may get better offer from R.

		Test of their sincerity = their agreemt. to free elections. wh. is not 			conceded in this Note.  We, U.S. and Fr. proposed in autumn U.N. 			commn. to supervise electns. in all G.  We can ask them to honour that.



		Later this month – Strasb. mtg. (Ad. Sch. and I. will be there.  Acheson 		mght send Bruce to join – for 4 Power considn. of R. note and agree a 		reply.  Shall put tht. machinery plan today to U.S. and Fr.



		Luckily U.S. realise tht. this = most imp. R. demarche of recent yrs. 		and needs v. careful handling.



P.M.		Avoid upsetting Adenauer.

		This is intended to obstruct.  If it were sincere, they cd. go a step 			further.

		Don’t upset Lisbon agreemts.  reached with so much diffy.

		I wd. be much influenced by A.  Neutral G. undermined by Commn. 		wd. go way of Czecho.



		Keep close in touch with U.S. and don’t let A. down.  Want you to go 		to Bonn.



A.E.		We can say if this OK. for G. why not for Austria.



L.P.S.		Para. 7 wd. exclude G. from N.A.T.O. forever.



A.E.		And prevent E.D.C. forever.

		Means tht. R. are worried.  It’s heartening on that a/c.





		6.	Restrictions on Travel by Soviet and Satellite Diplomats.



A.E.		Reslns. imposed with H.O. concurrence – as retaliation.  We can relax 		in return for concessions by them.



P.M.		Delighted to see it.



A.E.		Agreed in Lisbon.



P.M.		All will approve save Liberals.





		7.	Egypt.



A.E.		Handed in revised version of joint statement.

		Not hurrying discns.  Content tht. Amb. shd. have this for guidance 			only and refer back to us for final instns.



A.		“B. fighting troops” vice “B forces” in para. (2).  A.E. agreed.

		No time limit.  



A.E. 		None in this.  Discns. will widen out to 4 Power basis or wider.



L.P.S.		Can we call off w’drawal if no agreement reached?  



A.E. 		Yes.



O.L.		Delete ‘inalienable’ and ‘full’ in para. 5.  Awkward in reln. to Cyprus.



P.M.		My own view : we have more posn. of strength in E.  We need not 			hurry.  They wd. come round : wd. get somethg. better.

		Must not offer w’drawal in one year – “super Abadan”.

		Alter para. (2).  The principle of evacn. of B. forces fr. Eg. soil in ’56 		was agreed in Treaty ’36.  If satisfy. agreemt. were reached as to 			arrangemts. thereafter the date 1956 mght. possibly be advanced.



A.E.		We only agreed to H/C. and withdrawn on promise to 				w’draw.

		Para. 2 designed only to help present E. Govt.

		Second half of para. 2 represents new offer by E. Govt.



P.M.		F. Power proposals bring in nothing but a defence organn. – no troops 		fr. any other Allied powers.



A.E.		Need for a statement of principles to help to steady the present E. 			Govt.



		E. has abrogated 1936 Treaty.



Sim.      	x/.   “…principle of progressive w’drawal of B. fighting troops fr. 			Egypt upon the fooling tht. the Egypt. Govt. ….”.



P.M.     	y/.    Wd. agree as a gesture to take some troops away now.



Al.		Amb. cd. give a hint of that – not in formal text.



A.E.		I accept x/.  May I authorise y/. in words to be agreed later.



Al.		I will consult C.I.G.S.    N.B.  to ascertain formula.



		Sudan.



R.A.B.		Put some alternative.  



A.E.  		Cdn’t accept that.

		Approved : subject to above.			[Exit Al.





		Sterling Balances.



R.A.B.		Will hold the £10 m.

		If they apply import reslns. we shall refer to negotns.

		But cotton is being financed (£2/3 m. p.m) and some decn. will have to 		be made.

		Will hold until A.E. asks me to release and P.M. agrees.









		8.	Meat.



P.M.		Believe we can get Admy. p’mme down.

		3½ m. extra in refineries cpd. with ’39.

		Suppose we knock this down, and get somethg. off steel for huts (eg. 		30/40.000 tons) – then I want some meat.  60.000 t. in Uraguay.

		Consider again – on memo. at early mtg.  P.M.  Thursday.



		9.	Council of Europe.



A.E.		Attempt to give it a job to do – Schuman and Pleven Plans.  Tho’ 			members of neither, we shd. be there.



		Diffy. of H.M. memo. is tht. Europe wants fedn – which we cdn’t 			accept – we shd. be holding them back.  Also in N.A.T.O. they have 		commw. basis.



		Alternative in my memo. is more practical.

		Suggn. re sterling wd. weaken st. area and conflict with Imp. 			Preference.

									[Exit Sim.



M-F.		End of p.1. last para.  Wd. regret abolition of 15 Power Assembly.

		What else is in A.E.’s mind?



A.E.		If chief task is E.D.C. and Sch. Plan, then as we aren’t members of 			them our posn. wd. have to be revised to ensure a difft. connection.

		Wd. add O.E.E.C., as Salter suggests.



		? A Cttee with Nutting representg. me, and Salter for R.A.B.



H.M.		My memo. puts on record Tory Party view of this.

		Don’t abolish C/Europe or turn it into mere instrument of E.D.C. 			Powers.



		Aim to subordinate Fedn. to C/Europe rather than reverse.



		Agreed :  Further Cab. discn. Thursday with Nutting representg. A.E.
