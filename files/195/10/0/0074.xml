			                                           [Exit  B-H.

			                                           [Enter  3 Serv. Min. &amp; 2 C.O.S.

	2.	Korea.



A.E.	Demand tht. we be on armistice talks – in H/C.  Can’t at this stage:

		wd. be misrepresented by Commts.              Agreed.

	Larger pol. role.  No.  U.S. must be in lead.  We cd. put a more senior

		man in K.  Will discuss with Acheson.

	Measure of integrn in mil. staffs.  If U.S. were willing to make statemt.

		favourg. that in principle it wd. help in practice &amp; satisfy U.K. 

		opinion.  Propose to ask M/S. or Al. to canvass it with U.S.

		C.O.S. in W’ton.

		Have not prepared draft yet.



C.I.G.S.	We are satisf. with dirn of campaign since R. came in – also mil.

		handling of armistice talks.  We are not anxious for integrated 

		H.Q. – will be diff. to find this type of officer, in view of

		competing demands.  We wd. fall in with Alex. suggn for B. Ch.

		&amp; mil. opns.  But junior officers won’t help, esp. on pol. side –

		where weakness is.  Wd prefer pol. advisers e.g. M/State (U.S.

		&amp; Br.).



P.M.	Cdn’t ask for big share of respons. when only 1/10th of strength.

	Dangerous to assume it even if asked.  Don’t want respons. w’out

		authority.  U.N. entrusted it to U.S. – let them go on.  Don’t need

		to get anything out of Alex mission.



Sal.	Doms. wd. welcome Dep. C. of Opns.  But wd. like it mentioned to

		them 1st.  Alex cd. spk. to Canadians:  Franks cd. spk. to

		Menzies.  Others don’t matter so much.

		produce a man.

					}

	Staff?   



C.I.G.S.  	V. small:  one.

				[Exit  C.O.S.



	3.	Coronation Preparations.	[Enter  D.E., O.P.



Sal.	Estimate slimmed down.



A.H.	V. poor to take part in battle-dress:  v. undignified, esp. as cpd. with

		Navy &amp; R.A.F.

	Afterwards, will re-issue as walking-out dress.



P.M.	Don’t commit us to put whole Army into blue.

Sw.	V. few people see it.  Last time only a few thousand.

	Fly-past in Ldn. on Coronn Day wd. be more impressive.



A.E.	Most Army is overseas.



P.M.	Cd let ships at home be “at home” &amp; illuminated.



A.E.	Favour Naval Review alone, w’out Med. Fleet.

		Agreed:  no naval reviews.



	Assistance Board.



Sal.	Cttee recommend nothing be done.  Condns &amp; allowances, have

		changed since ’37.



O.P.	In ’37 numerous unempld on assistance, havg. tough time.

	To-day those on assistance are not the most hard-up.  Those on

		pension &amp; benefit are worse off.	Agreed.



	

 

	Stands.



Sal.	Will cost over £330.000;  but shall recoup most of the cost.

D.E.	Doubt if we cd. get royalties for filming of route.



P.M.	Let it be free to all, on the route.



P.T.	V. doubtful:  shd. have to sell exclusive rights:  then how keep the

		others out?  Police?



	Decorations.



Sal.	Is £150.000 too much?  Cttee were doubtful.



D.E.	i) getting more money from stands.  ii) television at home – many more

		will see route.  iii) colour film needs it:  &amp; will be seen all over

		the world.  iv) The Mall etc., must be worthy of occasion.

	Am spending less on decorns off route:  to concentrate on route

		because film &amp; television.



P.M.	People shd. be told to wear their medals.



M.F.	Arches in Mall – 20.000 &amp; over.  Wd be thght. extravagant.



A.E.	No good practising cheese-paring economies.



P.M.	F’lighting is better than decorations.  Do a lot of it.



D.E.	Costs quite a lot, in equipmt. &amp; wages.



Sal.	Fireworks on S. Bank site.

	7.	Control of Building Operations.



P.M.	Put R.A.B. view.



D.E.	Don’t accept that.  Firms doing m’tenance work don’t do new bldg.

		To get best output we ought to let up on m’tenance – wh. has 

		bn. cut back because prices rise while limit is m’tained.

	Licensing – only 7% are being refused.  Want to get rid of it – v.
