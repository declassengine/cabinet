C.C. 52(52)							13th May 1952



		1.	Germany : Reply to Soviet Govt.	[Enter P.M.G., B-H., Sw



		Draft reply – noted.





		2.	Defence : Talks between M/D. and M. Pleven.



Al.	Reported on talks on previous day.

	Support for E.D.C.  Best contn by R.A.F. ii) B.A.O.R.  iii) R.N. Summarised what each cd. do and suggd. staff talks on ways and means.  Link already thro’ B. Mil. Delegn.



	They heard me politely, but Juin stressed logistical diffies. of joint operns. by several countries.  Obvious problem : one for Shape : but wd. be worse if B. Forces were integrated more fully with E.D.C.  French are still sore at our not having joined E.D.C.



	Joint communiqué issued at conclusion.  Based on A.E.’s statement to H/C. on 15/2 : hope it will be approved.

	Pleven still anxious to convince Deputies of our support.  Cd. we make a further decln. in 2 Houses just before he speaks to Deputies.

	Two staffs are at work : that is a practical step.



A.E.	Fr. Socialists won’t be satisf. by any further statement.  They will vote in the end.



Al.	(In reply to P.M.) I did not suggest training Germans here. – only that we wd. help in training of G. Army (sc. in Germany).  



P.M. 	There will be P.Q. on this.





		3.	Equal Pay.



R.A.B.	Motion has attracted Tory support.

	Choice : i)  table Amendmt. and put Whips on.

		 ii)  let Fin. Sec. spk. and seek to avoid a vote.

	Trouble about ii) is tht. Motion invites Govt. to name a day for introdn. of equal pay.

	Can we be sure of getting the chaps here on course (i).



P.M.	Wd. prefer to see it talked out – preferably by Tory back bencher.



R.A.B.	The issue will come to a vote because debate will last all day and Spkr. wd. accept motion tht. ques. be now put.



B.H.	Don’t want to whip on a Friday.  Also back benchers are sympathetic to the motion.

H.C.	Don’t wish to appear to oppose this in principle.  Talk it out or let it be passed.



R.A.B.	Cdn’t implement it for 12 mos. anyway.

	Let Fin. Sec. say we can’t do it yet.  Then try to get a back bencher to talk it out.



		Agreed :	Say it in a speech.

				Don’t have official amendment.

				No Whips.





		4.	B.B.C. Charter.



L.P.	The pro-sponsors wdn’t take our draft.  Said they wd. sooner we were frank and turned us down.  They wdn’t support vague wording.  They couldn’t be budged.  They believe they have a big majority in H/C.

	They insist tht. Govt. shd. declare their decision tht. there shd. be competition in television.

	B.B.C. are whipping up support for monopoly.

	Can’t predict how opinion mght be divided in Parlt.

	

P.M.G.	Important point, in para. 8, tht. Parlt. will determine condns. before first licence is issued.



R.A.B.	Only the terms and condns. – not the ques. of principle.



P.M.G.	Parlt. cd. throw them out.



A.E.	Feeling in our Party is strong and unanimous in favour of allowing some competition.



Sim.	Why do we favour competn. in principle, in television not in Sound.



P.M.	There is no answer to that – save that it is a pol. compromise.

	P’pone it for 3 years.  We can’t get an agreemt.  We shall be beat on a division.



A.E.	Can’t go fwd. with this unless we are sure Party will vote for it.



J.S.	85% or more are firm on this.



P.M.	Para. 25.  Don’t want to be committed.  Prefer to say “P.M.G. under the general authority and direction of the P.M.” 



		Agreed : 	And delete Para. 25 third sentence.



R.A.B.	We are deserting the national interest under back bench pressure.

	Same as transport.  Where is this tending?



Sal.		Believe this may command a majority of Tory Lords.



H.C.		H/C. can’t discuss this and Transport before Whitsun.  Propose to take 		it immed. after Whitsun.



Sal.	H/L. can’t easily wait so long – Reith has a Motion.  Propose tht. H/L. shd. take it first.



Sw.	Awkward because the vote carried the formal approval for executive action.



Sal.	Have promised R. not to be later : must at least be on same day.



H.C.	Don’t want H/L. to lead on both this and Transport.



P.M.	H/C. can’t grumble if they have no time to do it first.  No principle at stake in this.



		Agreed :	(Put out W. Paper this week (Thursday)

				(Let H/L. debate it if they wish

				(H/C. to debate on 9/6.



	* Para.18. worthies shd. be warned in advance.  (P.M. to write.



							       [Exit P.M.G., B.H.

		5.	Meat : South American Negotiations.	       [Enter Ll.G. and T.D.



Ll.G.	Financial limit was imposed.  Ask now for higher ceiling.  For cuts made, since we came in, in other foods.  Wd. be v. diff. to defend not

	buying meat wh. is available – esp. as we have favourable balance with Argentine and they have taken special steps to make meat available (eg. meatless days and higher price to producer).  If we took all we cd. get there in Uraguay, it wd. involve only another £15 m.



	Limit of 160.000 t. wd. be mistake – earlier agreemt. promised max. trade.  His second condn. v. purchase of our goods is reasonable.

	A quantity limit is bound to provoke increase in price because they want sterling.



P.M.	Consumption of meat p. head in U.K. is only 60% of 1938.



R.A.B.	Limit of £25 m. made on 26/3.  Added £5 m. because of concession on oil.

	Enough now to promise to buy more meat if they buy more imports.



Ch.	Why don’t we get corr. increase in our exports to A.?  Then we cd. buy more of their meat.  Why don’t we barter oil and meat [: and raise our prices corr. with theirs.]  - 10 tons of oil for 1 t. meat. as last year.



L.	We have sold the oil already – can’t barter now.

Ch.	Our expenditure on meat is relatively small.  Look for £15 m. to cut out of other overseas expendre. – a cut of 2% overall wd. do it.

	It is a choice of unpalatable courses.



L.P.	Is it – what of mutual trade.  They must have sterling to buy our goods.



A.E.	Method of negotiation : I wd. continue a) and c) from the start.

	Otherwise we shd. be offering at outset to buy only £21 and we are wishing to sell £30 : and they will turn sour on you.

	They want to sell meat to us.

	On Uraguay : we shd. ask now what amount is available, adding tht. we can’t spend anything like as much on their’s as on A. meat.



P.T.	Amount and price of our exports must be kept in view.  Ready to take all their meat if we can force our textiles on them.  We may well be able to agree on a higher level of trade than R.A.B. proposes.

	We shd. impress this on our negotiators.



A.E.	I agree.  Don’t start with 160.000 tons.



R.A.B.	£30m. plus whatever extra goods we can sell to them.

	Not only textiles – coal and oil if necessary.



Sal.	A. and N.Z. prices are v. much lower.  There will be tendency for them to press for higher prices.

		viz.,  No ceiling at outset of negotiations.  See where we go.





		6.	Meat Prices.



L.P.	Price must rise because Budget decn. on subsidy.

	Ration increase wd. be simultaneous.



Ll.G.	Shd. I announce this in H/C. debate Thursday?



P.M.	Shd. like to see the list of changes.

							[Exit T.D. and Ll.G.

							[Enter D.S.

		

		7.	Germany : Manufacture of Guided Missiles.



A.E.	U.S. keen tht. G. shd. make short range guided missiles.  We dislike this : mainly because of effect on B. public opinion.  Can’t dissuade G. – save by promise of co-opn. wh. M/S. doesn’t like.

	Choice now is betwn. c) and d).



D.S.	Common p’mme wd. be even more dangerous than allowg. G. prodn.

	They are a long way behind Allies.  Collabn with G. wd. dry up exchange/informn. with U.S.  They are suspicious even of Australia because of Comm. leanings.

	If they make these in G., they will get back Germans who are workg. here : about 30 of them.

	On propulsion G. are well advanced.  On guidance they know less.



P.M.	Offer (d) on condn. they don’t suck informn. out of G. here.



D.S.	Cdn’t do that.



Ch.	They can produce rockets now.

	Guidance : techn. quite diff. for short range.  Beam riding works for short, but not for long.

	Why not limit by length of weapon (eg. 2 metre) – also location of manuf. as far away as possible.



D.S.	They will do all research they can into long range.



Al.	V. remote danger of G. mil. resurgence.



P.M.	I agree.  If they turned v. us, they wd. get atomic thrashing at once.



Al.	Give consent on condn. of location acceptable to us and fix eg. shores of Lausanne.  



D.S. 	And limit of size – ask G. what they suggest.



D.S.	This is the risk I wd. prefer – rather than common p’mme.



							[Exit D.S.



		8.	United Nations Association.



Sal.	U.N. Assocn. passed resoln. of protest v. Govt. policy.

	Mtg. on Sunday in B’ham – first of a series to be organised by U.N. Assocn. to explain just why C.R.O. policy is wrong.

	I wish to resign my Vice Presidency.



A.E.	Try first to get it stopped.  Pol. consequences of dissociatg. ourselves fr. U.N. Assocn.  Much Liberal opinion in this Assocn.



		Agreed : F.O. and C.R.O. to get it changed.
