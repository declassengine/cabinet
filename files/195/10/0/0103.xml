CC. 93 (52)					6th November, 1952



1.	    Parliament.

				[Enter Sw., B.H.



H.C.	Monday:  Oppn amendmt. mainly on unemplt.  W.M. to reply.

	Tuesday:  R.A.B. opens.  H.C. replies.

	Business for remainder of week.

					[Exit B-H.



2.	    Commonwealth Economic Conference.



a) Development.			[Enter T.D., J.F., D.S., Ll.G.



R.A.B.	U.K. help wd. increase our b/p diffies.  But am exploring means with Banks. Will report later on that.

	We must treat U.K. developmt. as of equal importance.  



Sw.	Para. 16 (a). – we don’t want private investment to taper off.



T.D.	Para. 10.  Expansn will involve “sp. measures” fr. time to time.  We cd. do more with a little more cap. investmt.



R.A.B.	I don’t dissent.



D.S.	Para. 10.  Add civil aircraft to special list.





	b) Commodity Policy.



P.T.	Choices in para. 8.  All Dpts. agree to (3) as best, for reasons in para.11.

Main purpose wd. be to stabilise price.



A.E.	Fear we may fall betwn. 2 stools.  Appreh. these agreemts:  yet wheat has worked out well.  Suppose U.S. approach us, diff. to put up counter offer then:  easier if we took a more positive line, &amp; push some of these.



Sw.	Diff. with Doms.  e.g. on wool.  But tin &amp; rubber wd. be useful to us.  cf. World Conf. in ‘30’s.

	This is not a wholly negative approach:  merely tht. we prefer empirical approach.



P.T.	Agree -  bias in favour.  But all out plan wd. founder on Dom. diffies.



Ch.	Evening – out of U.S. purchases, is of paramount importance.



J.F.	At Conf. v. wide diff. of view:  each country had one policy for imp. &amp; another for exports.

					[Exit T.D., Ll.G.

3.	    United Nations: Tunis.



A.E.	U.S. have told Fr. they will vote in favour of competence.  V. awkward for us.  Shall discuss with Acheson &amp; Schuman on arrival.  Propose to resist.

	Even more diff. will be S. African Policy.  V. diff. to get anyone to agree tht. it is solely a domestic issue.  Won’t be a popular line in H/C.  But it is thin end of v. dangerous wedge because of our Colonial affairs.



P.M.	Stand with the French, boldly.  



J.F.	We have commd ourselves to that attitude to S.A.





4.	    Egypt and Sudan.



A.E.	Cab. shd. see my reply.  Also consider wtr. consultn with Doms. is required now.



J.F.	Malan wd. object &amp; might leave Comm.  Can. Austr. &amp; N.Z. mght. also object – because machine won’t work with small units included.



A.E.	Consider at Comm Confce.  * Let C.R.O. put in memo on genl. ques.*



					[Exit J.F.

					[Enter G.Ll., D.E.

5.	    Atomic Energy Organisation.



P.M.	Sal. (absent) favoured Ch.’s view.



Ch.	Convinced after 12 yrs’ expce.  U.S. fr. scratch, got bomb in 3 yrs.  R. in 4 yrs.  We took 7 yrs. &amp; another 3 before we are in full prodn.  With full priority &amp; all money reqd.  Because C. Service is not adapted for this work.  cf. record of the diffusion plant.  Now is time to change – big prodn. future, already 1/2 size of I.C.I.  Multiplication of small delays.  June to Nov. to get small rise for Penney.

Danger is weakness at top:  if the 3 we have don’t stay:  or if we can’t get prodn managers.  I.C.I. have 75 at average salary of £4.500.  We can’t expand.

	Security.  Took us 3 mos. to get rid of real security risk ????.  Losing staff – cd. be mitigated by bonuses at end of contract.

	166 bodies working under grant-in-aid.  Parlt. can’t control exp’re now:  cd. do it better under open system – as in U.S.  Every other country works thro’ ind. corpn and Canada has changed over to that system.

	Transition:  w’draw suggn of transfer to sep. Dept.  Mght. be under L.P.

	Ask only for decn of principle.



D.S.	Am looking at this objectively.  Many facts shd. be taken into a/c.  Cockcroft says majority of Heads of Divn. favour staying in C. Service, tho’ with more independence as they might have under L.P.  They don’t want to lose security &amp; opportunity for promn elsewhere in Govt. scient. service.  Losses of staff:  no more than by firms in industry.  Not a ques. of theory:  organn is in being:  must have good reasons to warrant dislocn of a change.

	Suggest a small Cttee to state arguments for &amp; against.  Must be a year before legn cd. be introduced.



A.E.	I support Ch.  Security (U.S. views):  Corpn wd. make own rules &amp; be 

		more flexible. This work is not suited to C. Service methods.  Shd. be able to pay higher salies.



P.M.	Two sorts of enquiry.

i)	principle

ii)	wages &amp; means. Waverly might do ii)



R.A.B.	… Control in U.S. is v. detailed.

	Much interdeptl. work bn. needed on a. energy.  Shdn’t go too far

	away.  Dangers to other Govt. scientific work if abnormal salaries

	given to atomic scientists.

	Won’t be easy to est. corpn.  There will have to be Govt. control:  money will come into it dispropte salaries won’t be possible.



Al.	Canada.  Transfer to State Co.  Thght to be gt. improvement.  Favour Cherwell’s plan.

a)	we are only country to keep it in Dpt.  

b)	U.S. wd. be readier to co-operate in orgn like their own.	



D.E.	M/W. have done £50m bldg. for this.  Special team experienced in this.  No delays due to Ty. control, or complaints re speed of bldg.  Have earned Penney’s praise.  Corpn wd. have to build up a new special team:  we cdn’t spare ours.

	A change now wd. slow up work progress.  



Sw.	Corpn cd. employ M/W. if they thght. them efficient.



M.F.	Support Ch.  Para. 4 of O.L’s memo. – powerful reasons.



Sw.	Security  C.S. methods (v. fair) aren’t safe enough for this.  Corpn  make it condn of contract tht. he cd. be dismissed w’out notice, or tht. ppt. shd. be held.



L.	Favour small Cttee of Ministers.



P.M.		i) Report by small body of Ministers.  L.P.S. W.M. H.M. to 	

			confer with D.S. &amp; C.H.  Report in 2 weeks.

		ii) How &amp; when shd. then be remitted to Cttee of experts under Waverely + 2 assessors (?Akers &amp; Woods).

					[Exit M-F. G.Ll.



6.	    Blitzed City Centres.



P.M.	Pretty steep to stop this work – e.g. Ldn.



R.A.B.	£80-100m increase in bldg p’mme.  Any avail. resources shd. go into production industry.  Do no more than feed ad hoc any work on wh. unempld labour is available.  My figures show there’s no unemplt. argumt. for increasg. total.



H.M.	Small in amount but more serious.  Honour:  mutilated cities have bn. ill-served.

Interest:  68 Parly seats, of wh. 28 are held by us, some by narrow margins.

Costs nothg. to Exchequer or rates:  &amp; when built will pay rates &amp; taxes.  Rateable value is created by this, not by houses.  L.A.’s who have purchased land are getting Exch. grant wh. will taper off when bldgs. are up.

	£2m work to be done next year:  Ty. only want me to put in 1/2m. if I don’t put more in now there will be no work in the followg. year.

	Only 63 jobs in hand now:  25 will be done by end/52., more early in ’53.  There will be unempld if we put no more work in.  Current unfilled vacancies mean nothg:  it’s what will happen when my jobs end.

	Whole amount = 1,300 houses.



P.M.	Sheer incapacity tht. this wasn’t done earlier, as in Germany.  Can we defend posve action to stop it being done now.



R.A.B.	Must increase our earning power.  



P.T.	This arises because ceiling for 52 was exceeded.  I wd. like to have exceeded mine for factories.  How can I refuse factory bldg. when Woolworth’s are allowed to build.



H.M.	Get away fr. “fair shares.”  Plymouth can build because they don’t want factories.  Coventry prob. will have to be refused.  Deal with it sensibly on a local basis.



R.A.B.	But I must preserve fair shares among Ministers in E.P.C.



P.M.	They co-operate in most harmonious distn of effort.



D.E.	State of bldg. indy. shd. be judged by ques. wtr. man who has licence

	 can get an early startg. date – not by emplt.  In blitzed cities, all but 4,

	 startg. date can be given at once.  Even in the 4 the delay is steadily 

	 moving down. In almost all these cities now, licensed work can start at

	 once – means we need more work.  Are we to hold it back because

	 investmt ceiling.  Let B/T. and M/S. ceilings also be elastic in these

	 cities.  In most there is not enough factory bldg. to take up the slack.

  Can’t get more workers into Coventry w’out more shops.



D.S.	Agree – when labour available &amp; factory work is not delayed.  But ceiling for factory work shd. be raised too.  Can’t judge wtr. there is enough factory work while ceiling is m’tained.



H.M.    {	May I seek a formula with R.A.B. so tht. I can announce somethg.

            {	wh. will preserve element of flexibility?

            {	Expanded version of R.A.B.’s para. 5.



 			Agreed.  



P.M.  	Let R.A.B., H.M. &amp; D.E. confer &amp; submit a solution. (to P.M.)





7.	    Supplementary Defence Expenditure.



R.A.B.	Not arguing merits – partly due to textile orders.	Parly need to disclose early, as proposed in memo.	               [Enter A.H.

				               [Exit D.E.

H.C.	Most improper Parly procedure – pity we weren’t warned earlier.



R.A.B.	Agree:  but no alternative now.  



H.C.	We shall be criticised – on timetable.



R.A.B.	I will take respons. for this, in speech on Tuesday in D. on Address.



A.H.	We told Ty. 2 mos. ago.  It’s their fault if Ministers weren’t told

	 earlier.



D.S.	Ditto. with us:  mostly book entries.
