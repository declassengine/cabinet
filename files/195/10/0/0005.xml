P.M.	Congrats. to R.A.B. on statement.



R.A.B.	Drain on sterling is less marked.  City pleased.  No pol. trouble over bank rate so far.  Went quieter than I thght.

		3.	Festival Gardens.



D.E.	Ministerial Order requd. v. re-instatement of Park.

	Legn. needed if it is to be kept on.

	Gardens popular – on attendance figures – among Londoners.

	Opinion in B’sea is divided.  Tories prob. favour closing.

	Recommend opening on 1 shift basis (to save labour) and no Sunday opening.

	Expect cap. expenditure to be larger.



R.A.B.		i)  Profit (360.000).  Exch. wd. recover only £52.000.  For L.C.C. 	guaranteed v. loss in excess of £40.000.

	With larger than ½ attendance Ty. wd. make much more.

	£470.000 at ⅔rds        “.



	ii) Capital expre.  Diff. to justify in present austerity.  Only as special case appd. by H/C.



	Just worthwhile for Ty. to seek re-coupment, subject to approval on austerity point.

	Public want it.  Wiser to go on than stop it.  On balance I favour continuance.  If there’s a clear endorsement by H/C. – eg. on a free vote.



D.E.	Cap. expre. – not much bldg. materials.  £1.000 limit for each item.

	Want assurance tht. managemt. will go on.  Joseph has worked for nothing.  Wd. rather give him a stake in it.



P.T.	Believe it has bn. attractn for f. tourists.  Support on that a/c.



W.	Need we fear frivolity.  Not much other fun.



P.M.	If we suppress, shall be charged with suppressg.  Soc. plan out of spite.



H.C.	Some Tory opposn.  Leave to free vote.



P.M.	Not on ques. involvg. expenditure.



J.S.	Free vote on a motion.  Whips for the legn.



D.E.	Quick decn needed by managemt. – for next yrs’ arrangements.



R.A.B.	Govt. majority on Bd.  Posn. of L.C.C. needs thght.  Then too diff. to have a free vote.



S.	Case for free vote on a motion.



R.A.B.	Bound to make something : may make a lot.  Financially, we ought to go fwd.  This is policy – not really for a free vote.



			Agreed : Continue Gardens : no free vote.





		4.	Persia.



L.	Unable to respond to U.S. plan, wh. was quite unacceptable.

	Handg. all over to R. Dutch.

	Now seems tht. P. won’t separate fields and refinery.

	We suggested y’day we wd. consider 50/50 with U.S. in refinery.  Wd. get U.S. in : exchange with Saudi.  U.S. oil cos. wd. resist terms State Dpt. suggested to us.  Rowan and D.F. have gone to Paris : I’m ready to go, if needed.

	Even the offer by M. wasn’t firm.



P.M.	Time and patience.  P. isn’t going to enjoy life.



L.	But pressure is fr. U.S. on argument of Communism.



P.M.	Doubt that.  And if it happened more forcible action wd. be justified and might be supported by U.S.



R.A.B.	I support L.’s plan.

	50/50 project wd. have given us no more than 30%.
