C.M. 86 (52)					15th October, 1952



1.	    Turkey:  Credits.

				 [Enter B-H., Sw.



A.E.	As in memo.  Turks take the line that this money was spent in common defence.



P.M.	Take a/c of reasonable chance tht. we need not pay interest on U.S. loans – maybe in respect of our defence effort.  We may be better able to get that if we have dealt generously with Turks.

	Turkey is in gt. danger.  And her assistce in N.A.T.O. closes R. access to M/E.

	You won’t get the money, but you might get gratitude.



R.A.B.	T. have treated us with contempt.  T. also letting down Bank, who lent money on commitmt to reach a fair settlement with us.

	Want to seek settlement after £12m. and waive past interest and future interest.  That wd. be a big concession &amp; in parallel with what I seek on U.S. &amp; Can. loans.

Also we have to negotiate Italian loan – sterl. balances.



A.E.	Pre-war debt:  not same as Italy or U.S./Canada.

	We asked Bank to put the pressure on T. to talk.			 [Exit M-F.

	If you don’t settle now, they’ll never pay.  Ty. must choose betw. a bad settlement now or no settlement ever.

	Our Amb. thinks we cd. get £7m.



R.A.B.	Mustn’t get it abroad that we can afford such generosity.



H.C.	Wiser to offer what is consistent with approach to U.S. and fail than offer somethg. less.



A.E.	Turks will say these are pre-war debts &amp; not comparable.

	They mght. cut down imports from U.K.



R.A.B.	If we go below £12m. it must be an act of State Policy, not a financial settlement.  [Ready to consider that – to-day: to be ready to talk Thurs]



A.E.	Will ask our Amb. wtr. it wd. be wise for me &amp; R.A.B. to squeeze

	 them now.  Will report back if we can’t get anywhere.



P.M.	M/D. to consider what they can be told about modern mines.  Vital tht. Bosphorus shd. be blocked to prevent R. from coming out into Medn.









2.	    N.A.T.O. Operation in Mediterranean.



A.E.	Just heard of another Exercise in Med.

	We must know details.



Al.	We are finding out.





3.	    Parliament.



H.C.	Dispose of H/C. Bills by Wed.  Then handle H/L. Bills

	3 days on Bds.

1)	Steel W. Paper

2)	Civil Aviation

3)	Ridley Dept?  F. &amp; Power

	Strasbourg – details later.

	Innocents:  In addn to Transport Bill, B. Museum Bill, Currency &amp; B. Notes, Dentists, Poachg. Deer (Sc.) Bill.

	Statement (periodical) on Korea:  volunteer it before E.Sh. asks for it.

	Frid. next wk:  Defamation Bill.  If it doesn’t get thro’, we can put it thro’ in followg. week.

				 [Re-enter M-F.

				 [Enter T.D. &amp; Wark

4.	    National Service.



W.	8.000 p.a. out of 800.000 in farming – are called up now.

	15/16.000 eligible:  exemptn (defermt) for stockmen etc., 50% deferred.

	Engineering:  a v. much higher propn is taken.



T.D.	Was proposing to discuss with M/L. means of easing posn w’out exemption.

	My remedy:  para. 8.  At present, if farmer employs more than 2 there is no case to consider.  I want all cases to be considered.

	Diff. to persuade farmers now tht. we are serious re f. prodn.

	My plan wd. mean another 7.000 wd. be considered and about 4.000 lost.



[A.E.	Against making any change.]



W.	We think only about 3.000.  Not worth the disparity with other industries.

		At 3.000 only there is not much sense in pretendg. agric. is liable.



T.D.	The young are specially valuable for mechanised agricultural work.

	Big psych. diffce to us, and little effect on Service.



R.A.B.	Unwise to breach principle of universality.

	But M/L. statemt. shd. not be so rigid:  use caveat “while present commitment continues.”  We must preserve means of making some saving.  Wd. prefer to make a small movement over whole field; rather than “exempt” for some industry.



P.M.	This concession might start a run.

						  [Exit A.E.



H.C.           |	Are we deferring the right men?  “Full-time stockmen” doesn’t cover 

                y |	farm when there’s no scope for a stockman full time.



W.	Danger of appearing to breach principle of universality.



J.S.	Comparable with coal.  Diff. to convince farmers tht. we want 60% increase of production.



 x/   P.M.	 Better to say nothg. doing so long as our present commitmt last – as 		M/D said at Scarborough.



R.A.B.	Keep open the possibility of delaying the call-up.



			Agreed    1) As at x/.

			                2) M/L. and M/Ag. to consider y/.
