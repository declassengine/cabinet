C.C. 7(51)							15th November 1951



		1.	Import Cuts.					[Enter Ch.Whip



P.M.	Comment – no cut in tobacco, wines etc.



R.A.B.	Revenue makes such profit esp. on tobacco.  Also, repercussions in U.S.

	Wines.  Some fiscal measures may limit consumption.

	Cd. be explained in a speech.  Will provide a brief for weekend spkers.



H.C.	Swinton made the tobacco point in H/C.



P.M.	Either higher taxation or rationing wd. be only way of curtailg. tobacco.



R.A.B.	Will send note to P.M. and spkers. brief to W.





		2.	Persia.



A.E.	No statement in H/C. until Mon.

	But publn. of A-Iranian b/sheet.  Shows increased profits and double drawing by Ty. cpd. with last year.  Cd. say they can’t delay before Monday.



L.   	x/.  They’ve said they will publish to specified date.



A.E.	It justifies R.A.B.  Will do what I can, subject to x/.



A.E.	Cd. it be deferred until Parlt.’s up and discns. with U.S. are over.





		3.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	F. Affairs debate.  A.E. to open. and with leave, reply on 2nd day.  Nutting to open on Tuesday.

	Wed : Supplementaries for new Ministers’ salaries.

	

	Agreed : R.A.B. to speak.  P.M. to be available in case of trouble.



P.M.	No hurry about Def. Debate.  Can wait until December.





		4.	German Defence Contribution.		[Exit Ch.Whip



A.E.	As G. mil. contn. (Eur. Army etc.,) rises, so reluctance to pay Occupn. Costs.

	Recommend course 14(a) : makg. clear our financial limit.

Ch.	Many of figures unrealistic.  6.00m.  Allied costs : a German figure : means £2.000 p. head of men there.  In argument we shd. not use these figures.  Also £4.000 m. for 12 Divns. – much larger than B. standard.  Presumably U.S. standards converted into Reichmarks.  Also cost of m’tenance of divns. is much larger than ours.

	If we were paying for occupn, cost wd. be much less.  We shd. see to that.  Gap may not therefore be so large as suggested.



O.L.	Para 12(iii) is impossible.  If it comes to it, 12(i) is only possible course.



R.A.B.	Cd. A.E. get course set clearly with U.S. before approachg. Germans.

	Gt. economies cd. be made in Br. expenditure in Germany.



P.M.	Chance of peaceful settlemt. might turn on agreemt. with R. by wh. G. was unified, but left unoccupied and provided only with token forces.  Mustn’t sell Germany : but they mght. prefer to get unity at that price instead of being divided and adhering E. and W.  Bear in mind.



A.E.	G. prob. divided.  Doubt if Adenaur really wants unity now.



P.M.	On basis above, G. wd. have to pay big financial contn. – otherwise their trade competn. wd. be unsupportable.



S.	Unwise to hasten formation of G. Army – tho’ adhere to principle.



P.M.  	(Ad hoc Cttee of 5 to recommend.

	(R.A.B., Salisbury and Cherwell with Junior Minister 		 F.O. (Chairman)



A.E.	I cd. hold posn. on



	Para. 14(a).	And officials cd. examine deeper consequences.

P.M.  	Ministers shd. consider both ques. at once.



Ch.	Para. 12.	(iii)  excluded because of import card for peace.

			(ii)   excluded because of financial posn.

			(i)    2nd half is only solution : economy elsewhere.



P.M.	Doubt if we cd. face (i) or (iii).



R.A.B.	Harriman was pleased with statement of U.K. case.  Only defence p’mme really in action.  Promised his help in getting U.S. dollar support and steel.  Won’t be many dollars.  Steel 800.000 t. was in mind.



          *	Invitn. from P.M. to Harriman to come to see him in Ldn. after Rome.

P.M.  	Cab. Mon. pm. after A.E.’s speech – if needed.





		5.	Central Africa : closer Association.



O.L.	As in memo.

	Object : prevent penetration by S. Africans.



I.	Feared S.A. wd. object.  Geyer y’day volunteered tht. sooner done the better.  Also need to do it before Huggins goes for he cd. get it thro’.



S.	This is right on merits.  These are a unity, economically.

	Danger of Afrikans infiltration (sponsored by Union Govt.) is v. great.

	Huggins and Wilenski alone cd. get this over.

	We have always supported this as a Party.

	This may be our last chance.



P.M.	How wd. federation help to stop Afrikans’ infiltration.



Ch.	Amalgamn wd. be better fr. that angle.



O.L.	But wd. meet increased African opposition.  Not practicable, at this stage.  Must begin with federation.



H.C.  	Publish as a White Paper?



O.L.  	Make it as statement after P.Q.’s next week.

	         Want to get Opposn. to declare support as well.



P.M.  	Make it available as W. Paper also, simultaneously for                            

    	          convenience of Members.





		6.	Sudan.



A.E.	Sudanese divided.  Some wd. like unity with E.  Others want independence, prs. w’in Comm.  In South, no developed views.

	To meet all this,  Commn. was apptd.  It will recommend steps wh. will give self-govt. in 1952, prs. with some reserved topics.

	M’while Commn.(?) has invited U.N. to send a Commn.  Side tracked by promise of early U.K. statement.

	Object of this : rally those who don’t favour unity with Egypt.

	Want to make it this pm.



P.M.	Must you mention ’52.



A.E.	Commn. told sometime ago this wd. lead to self-govt. sometime in ’52.

	Can’t say less now.  Only say “may be completed …. by end 52”.



O.L.	We support statement.



H.C.	Meaning of self-determinn. in para. 3.?



A.E.	As in 1st sentence of para. 3.



P.M.	When do we get pushed out?



		Draft declaration approved.
