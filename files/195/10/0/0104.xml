C.M. 94(52).				7th November, 1952.



	1.	Defence Programme.               [Enter Sw., 3 Serv. Ministers, D.S.



Al.	Original plan £1838(53)  £1916(54) m.  Asked C.O.S. to review &amp;

		they prod. Gl. Strategy memo.  This was appd by Def. Cttee,

		as also A.E.’s commitmts:  £1719(53)  £1777(54).  Both savings.

		£1790(55) – also a saving.  At Ty. request I pressed for more

		saving &amp; produced £1645(53), £1688(54) and £1698(55).  Thus 

		since I took on £190(53), £228(54) savings secured – tho’ by 

		transfers &amp; rising costs real redn is greater by about £180 m.

		Can’t meet all existg. commitmts, incldg N.A.T.O., on less 

		than this.



R.A.B.	Grateful for efforts made to cut back.  But we can’t afford this and

		normal social p’mmes of peace.  Global strategy – good, but we

		haven’t calculated def. pattern on basis of what we can afford.

		Can’t stand this, esp. its rising curve.  Hence my view expd in

		320:  £1550:  since then have gone to £1570.

	Will try to meet £480 on metal-using (as cpd. £485 bid by M/D.).

	On total Budgetary figure:  don’t want to settle unless decided we are

		going to make thoro’ review of future pattern of defence.

	C.393. para. 4. Face Budget gap of £300 m.  Supporters in H/C. look 

		for v. big cuts.  Might get 150 m. fr. civil economies.  Don’t

		want to fill remainder by increased taxation, wh. wd. cripple

		industry.  Another £30/40 m. to defence wd. equal whole of 

		entertainment duty.  Don’t therefore want to go further above

		£1600 m. than I can.  Budget must be designed to relieve tax on

		industry, to enable it to be competitive.

	Future, see no prospect of going above £1600 m.

	Propose therefore £1600 m. for ’53:  £450 for metals:  review of future

		pattern.



A.E.	Effect in Europe of any redn now (para. 10 of 393) wd. be great.  But

		ready for review of new pattern, incldg. M/E reliefs.

	Had thought of £480 for metals &amp; £1620 for total.  Plus a review.



Al.	At £1600 or £1620, what of compn paymts &amp; engineering wages

		(about £40 m.).



A.E.	Engineering award shd. be over &amp; above agreed figure.



D.S.	£30 m. compn for M/S. alone.  Much due to orders placed durg. this

		Govt – wh. began by urging speed e.g. on aircraft &amp; tanks

		cf. [51 m. on Canberras in 53 cut to 29.]

		     [85                                54           12.]

		      Ditto. with tanks.

		Shows need for firm fwd. p’mmes.



J.T.	This Govt. has accelerated small anti-sub. &amp; anti-mine craft.

P.T.	Accept $480 for metals – tho’ M/S. &amp; D/T. will look firm by firm at 

		switchg. to exports.

	Real problem is:  how finance defence at £1620 or so.  Para. 10 of 393

		proposes to cut social services &amp; give amount to increased

		defence.  That means v. little tax relief.  New firms can’t get 

		capital to start:  no private savings:  industry can’t compete in

		compn condns w’out tax relief.  We can’t have guns &amp; butter, in

		present quantities.  If we do this def. p’mme, even more social

		cuts will have to be made if exports are not to decline.  How can

		we put our econ. plans to C.E.C.



D.S.	Eng. exports can’t be expanded w’out relieving indy of taxn.



P.M.	Devote Xmas recess to review of future pattern (’54 &amp;’55).  Shall have

		to face redn in nos.  Must have good weapons.  But less tail, esp.

		in traing. establmts.



de L.	R.A.B. memo. figure means front-line of 1882.  To provide for

		Fighter expre we shd. have to cut bombers &amp; M/E. &amp; F/E. 

		(200 aircraft, wh. wd. have to be cut at once).  T.A.F:  forming

		2 squadrons with U.S.:  But in Sep. shall have 200 more aircraft

		in G. than now.  But can’t equip them with Swifts.  Shall have to

		cut 200 odd Hunters &amp; 8 Swifts.



Sw.	Can’t settle much above £1600 m. w’out risk to exports wh. might 

		endanger the £.



R.A.B.	Indicated nature of cuts to be imposed on civil expenditure up to 

		about £150 m.



Sim.	How wd. 394 look on basis of £40 vice £75 m. cut.  Shd more come 

		off R.N. than R.A.F.



de L.	Saving by reductn of man-power gives small dividend:  £1 m. for 

		every 3.000 men.



A.H.	Settle near £1645, to avoid public shock to U.S. &amp; others, on basis of

		quick review of future pattern.



D.S.	Avoid 2 more cuts on industry.  I have made 1 in anticipn, shall have

		to make another on ’53 decn;  don’t ask me to make another in

		spring.



M-F.	£1610 for ’53.  (Consequences in 394 wd. be £40 m. less severe than

		now stated).  R.N. shd. be cut more, and benefit given to R.A.F.



P.M.	£1600 but no reductn in Divns. or latest types of equipmt. until I am

		satisfied.



R.A.B.         *	£1600 – but variations on cost as proposed in C.320., para. 15.

A.H.	Germany:  anything over £30 m. has to be found by W.O. out of 

		savings.



R.A.B.	Aim to get any excess over £30 m. on to G. or elsewhere.

			

			* Agreed:  excess shd. not have to be found by Army.



H.C.	Commitments – 2 kinds.  Tempy (Malaya &amp; Korea) &amp; Permt (N.A.T.O.

		and re-armament) wh. is more important.  Cd they be analysed 

		in cost?



P.M.	Fix 1953 as at * but £1610.  £480 for metals.

	Consider means of effecting the cut.  For I don’t yet accept

	cuts in Divns. or new aircraft.

	Review (covering strategic, econ., pol. &amp; financial) further

	pattern for ’54 and ’55.



H.M.	Evaluate cost of particular commitments e.g. Trieste.



A.E.	Need for early commn to N.A.T.O.
