	5.	Health Service:  Pay of Doctors.



R.A.B.	………



W.M.	Wd prefer it spread.



L.P.	If treated for tax as one year’s income, doctors wd. surely prefer 

		it spread.



R.A.B.	Won’t be treated as part of this year’s income – arrears related to 	earlier years.



H.C.	Wd be breach of faith to avoid immediate payment.



I.McL.	Complicated now by lodging of appeal.

			                                                    [Exit  McL.

			                                                    [Enter  L-B., G.Ll., Att.G.

	6.	Transport Bill.



L.	As in memo.

	Levy will cover rather more than ½ m. vehicles.

	Rlways.  Separate regional Board.  But Scotland not satisfied with that.

	Objn to excessive powers of intervention by Minister – on behalf of

		other Bds.  But satisf. he must have more than now.

	Compensn to those displaced fr. emplt. is diff.  Many will have to go

		outside the industry.

	Assumed all crown vehicles will pay levy.  Objns by G.P.O.?



P.M.	Of 40,000 natd vehicles, 3.500 will be taken by rlways.



L.B.	But large vehicles – bigger propn of tonnage than nos. wd. indicate.

	Minister’s powers.  Will be v. diff.  Under ’47 Act we did direct on

		fares.  Wd have bn. willing to rest on that.  Otherwise M/T. may

		get too much harried by P.Q.’s.

	Compn – can’t go beyond Bill.

	Road passenger services – Party want them unscrambled.  Don’t want

		them all run by rlways.  S.M.T. owned by State.  Must look into

		this further – even at cost of delay.

	Happier now we have found means of giving rlways. reasonable share

		of road traffic.

	Shan’t have enthus. support:  but shd. carry reasonable opinion.

		Rd. Haulage Assocn are calling off their antagonism.



A.E.	P. 25. 2(d).  Fixing of charges.



L.B.	Taken fr. earlier Act.  But cdn’t defend in H/C.  Shall reconsider

		Cl. 19 in light of B.T.C. comments.



Sw.	Want flexibility in charges:  but must prevent old canal ramp.

	Give rlways. latitude to run commercially:  but if used to kill 

		competn, competitor shd. have right of appeal to T. Tribunal.



L.	Once rlways. freed from need to publish rates, &amp; operate subject to a

		maximum, they will be better able to offer competitive rates.



P.T.	Why not leave it open?



O.L.	Because gt. power of rlways. cpd. with small road undertakgs.



H.C.	Power of intervention.  Shd. not extend the powers in Bill.  Sel. Cttee

		considerg. this as genl. ques.  Also, we shd. be pressed to amend

		all other Acts accordingly.  Support L.B.’s suggn of relying on

		existing powers.



Sal.	Agree.  But v. diff. problem.  We feared autocratic Minister.  But

		autocratic Bd. is more dangerous.



L.B.	Cl. 22(4) obliges Commn to keep Min. informed.  His power under

		’47 Act enables him to act if public interest is involved.



L.	B.T.C. resent havg. to rept. to Minister.



G.Ll.	This is general point.  Dangerous to decide it solely on reln of M/T.

		to B.T.C.  Our expce has bn. quite different.  M/T. experience

		due mainly to personalities – Hurcomb.



P.M.	Wd sooner put balance of power in hands of Minister, respons. to

		Parliament.



L.B.	If Minister gets the informn, the existg. powers are wide enough.

	Change wd. be interpreted as meaning more than it does.



G.Ll.	Important change is departure fr. “general” directions.  New words

		[“genl. public importance”].  Cd now give particular dirns on

		matter of [ ].



H.C.	Don’t change on basis of one Bd. only.



Sim.	Ques. may be of gt. public importce, but directions wd. have to be of

		a genl. character.



L.B.	Agree:  that diffy wd. continue, if existg. words are relied upon.



Sal.	Cuts out matters of importance wh. are not nation-wide.



G.Ll.	No:  public interest may be involved even in a local case.



H.	Clyde Piers – was held that Minister had no power to intervene.



H.M.	Putting this in Bill wd. open door for argument tht. we had not

		power to give the dirn we gave on fares.



O.L.	Unwise to include increased powers in a Bill wh. is to designed

		to cut down extent of State control.



Sal.	Still think ‘nat. interest’ is too wide a phrase.

	Minister will be responsible in face of public:  he shd. have the powers.



Sim.	Dirns of “general character” are the limiting words.



G.Ll.	They do give rise to diffy.  But equal diffies wd. arise fr. a power of

		specific dirn.  E.g. I cd. remove area genl. manager.



P.M.	Prefer to make no change in Bill as introduced.



L.	Experience of B.T.C. suggd need of more powers.



Sw.	Change Chairman, not powers.



Sim.	Want to drop “general” directions because want to increase powers

		of Ministers.



M-F.	Impressed by argument of timing.

	Propose omitting fr. Bill as introduced.  Consider further before

		Bill has passed.



P.M.	Agree.  See how opinion shapes in Parlt.



	Workers Charter.



W.M.	Can’t go into this Bill because nature of undertakgs.



Sw.	Bill is good.  Socialist doctrinaire centralisation.  We risked excldg.

		rlways.  We now say road tr. will be run either by rlways. or by

		cos. in competn all subject to same Tribunal.



	Scottish ques. to be considered by Transp. Cttee - &amp; back to Cab. if nec.

	

	Time-table.

		Can’t be ready by time p’mmed.

		1st R. 9/7.   Publish 10/7.  2nd Rdg. 18 days later.  28/7 or so.

		Gives one more week in wh. to produce a good Bill.

		

		Agreed:  can’t be presented next week.  Settle date later.



			                                              [Enter  D.S. &amp; de L’l.

			                                              [Exit  B-H., Att.G., G.Ll., L.B.



	7.	N.A.T.O.   Off-shore Purchase of Aircraft.



A.E.	i) criticism in N.A.T.O.  Can be faced.  They can be told it’s

		not their bus.



D.S.	Developmts. encouraging.  May get dollar orders.

	U.S. likely to accept our case.

	N.A.T.O. commitmts i) too high  ii) anyhow we shall do more than 

		others.



de Ll.	Welcome.  Realism.



			                 Approved.
