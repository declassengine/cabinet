C.C. 40(52)							9th April 1952



		1.	Egypt.						[Enter Sw.



A.E.	Para. 3 (Sudan) is improvemt. because E. recognises any decn. S. may take.  Eg. if S. opted for Comm. membership E. cdn’t complain – as she cd. as Co-Domimus now.  V. much better than anything so far.



	Para. 1. – no change.

	Para. 2. is crux.  “Respective points of view” gives us right to raise general ques. of M/E. defence.

	No immedte. publn. of this.  Agreed statement tht. discns. will be opened.

	Then I wd. recall Stevenson and Howe.



P.M.	Para. 2 brings in substance of 2 of C. 98.  Gives them all.

	Why not stop at “Zone” *  Followg. words admit their sole right to defend Zone, and assume tht. we go out and stay out.

	This gives us nothing more than Nahas asked for.

	Suppose we say this, and Wafd are returned at election, they will take all they want and deny us all else.  He is guilty of unilateral repudiation of Treaty he himself made in ’36.



	*Or add “as part of the larger policy for the defence of the M/E.”



A.E.	This gives more than Nahas a) respective points of view – they are ready to discuss our views.  b) Sudan (as above).

	Incln. of refce. to E. Army. That was friendly to us, most friendly element in E. aids us if they are armed and strengthened.

	Must explain request to omit these words.  Can I say as above?



Al.	“ … arming of the E. Forces with whom we wish to co-operate in the defence of the area.”  Wd. that help?



Sal.	Or stop at “E. Forces”.  Followg. words appear to imply tht. defence will be exclusive responsibility of E.



H.M.	Or insert a) and b) to make clear respective views.



P.M.	Willing to go down to “Forces”.



		Approved – as above.



								[Enter Ld. Ch.

		2.	Nationalisation.				[Exit L.P., H.M.



		(Not heard).









		3.	British Firms in China.



A.E.	As in memo. with regret.  Must cut their losses.



O.L.	Delete “friendly” from Annex.  



A.E.  	V. well.





		4.	Katyn Massacre.



A.E.	No harm in Congress Cttee. doing this – but not here!

	U.S. Amb. shares this view.  Cttee may modify plan.

	Cab. shd. see note because it may come before Congress.  Pretty stiff : but its right.



P.M.	Don’t like references to breaches of peace.  We can keep order.



M-F.	There wd. be demonstrations.  We cd. of course control them.



P.M.	Let them do it in Germany.

	In Public interest that this shd. be cleared up, if it can be.

	

H.C.	Our H/C. last year took exception to our Sel. Cttee. visiting foreign countries to inspect B. Embassies.



P.M.	Cdn’t you soften it up a bit?  



A.E. 	i) ii) and iii) are ok.  What about iv)?

	Opening paras. are quite polite.  



P.M. 	Make it shorter and simpler.  Make main point tht. we can’t alter our laws to make this possible here.



A.E.	V. well.  And H.O. and Ld. Ch. will be consulted on iv).

	Will see U.S. Amb. also, before it’s sent.





		5.	Canadian Meat.



Ll.G.	B’ground is foot and mouth in Canada, wh. prevents export to U.S.

	Canada therefore asks for this.

	If we turn it down, A. and N.Z. will get to know and dislike.

	F. and mouth is only in W. Province.



R.A.B.	We shd. make some dollars.  Wd. help Canada.



Sal.	S. Doms. mght get into U.S. market.  



Ll.G. 	No danger : not v. good meat.

P.T.	Wd. help Anglo-Can. relations.  We can’t often help them.  Usually the opposite.



Ll.G.	M/Ag. raises no objection.



		Proposal approved.





		6.	Tea.



		Draft announcement circulated.



P.M.	Why not increase ration on 15/6.



Ll.G.	Because not enough time to build up stocks.  Wd. involve risk of shortage.

	30 m. lbs. of tea.



Ch.	¼ of ration.  Over 8 weeks will run down stocks by only 2 weeks.

	Can’t you stand that?



Ll.G.	Stocks are dropping.

	My advice is from a man whose interest it is to increase consumptn.

		

		Approved with amendments.

							[Re-enter H.M. and W.

		

		7.	War Pensions.					[Exit Ll.G.



P.M.	Had read out statement to be made by M/Pensions today.
