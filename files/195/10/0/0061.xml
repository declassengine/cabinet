C.C. 47(52)							29th April 1952



		1.	Bamangwato Tribe.				[Enter Sw. G.Ll.



L.P.S.	Saw deputn. and told them y’day.  Will announce in H/L. today and see Lobby afterwds.

	May be asked if we will pay expenses of deputn.  £1.000.  They came un-asked.  But we have turned them down.  Favour paying – as a gesture.





		2.	Jamaican Constitution.



		Approved ex post facto.





		3.	Daily Worker.



Sim.	D.P.P. are investigating – picture in D. Worker.  Services are enquiring wthr. true or a fake.



O.L.	Saw y’day : instituted own enquiries via Templer.

	Also considering wthr. composite shots.  If that can be establd. will suffice for answer to immed. P.Q.’s.



P.M.	Probe, legally and technically.





		4.	Napalm : Ebor’s Remark.



A.E.	V. disagreeable weapon.



Al.	No worse than flame-thrower.



G.Ll.	We invented it – U.S. name for Bx. “gell” – to fill flame.

	Fougasses.  U.S. used it on aircraft.



A.E.	Can’t draw the line – short of atomic or b.w.

	Long corrce in M. Guardian on it some months ago.



Ch.	Horrors are exaggerated.





		5.	Korea.



A.E.	i) reconstn fairfields  ii) exchange of p.o.w.  iii) neutral observers.

	On i) and iii) U.S. were prepd. to give way to secure agreement.

	On ii) scrutiny has shown 60.000 of 130.000 unwilling to return – v. largely Chinese.  We have declined to return by force, but offered any form of investign. (after armistice).  Doms. agree with our view.  Wording of final para. is still under discn.

	Presented to Commn. y’day : expected them to refuse : but they have asked for adjournment.  They may therefore be ready to compromise.



P.M.	Ques. of honour and principle tht. we shdn’t compel people to return behind the Curtain.



A.E.	We have never taken any other line – tho’ some temporary mis-understanding betwn. us and U.S.





		6.	Egypt and Sudan.



A.E.	Stuck on Sudan.  No chance of agreement.  Read our latest formula, v. little diff. from that approved by Cab.  But a second para. offering consultn. with Sudanese.  That wd. be acceptable to Sudanese and is right; but E. most unlikely to agree.  Have asked U.S. to bring pressure on Farouk.



Sw.	If it is accepted A.E. shd. make it clear tht. S. are not being subjected to undue pressure.



A.E.          *	Will circulate formula – welcome comments, if any.

	If this not accepted, negotns. can’t start.  Then we must seek modus vivendi w’out new Treaty pro tem.



Ch.	Wd. we then go on with M/E. Command?  



A.E. 	Wd. consider.



P.M.	Dispersal of M/E. troops elsewhere wd. cost even more.

	My anxiety is preservation of Canal as international waterway.



Al.	Soft spot now in mil. side.  Amr. confirms tht. E. Army are v. friendly : want us to train and re-arm them.  Mght get a mixed Commn. to examine ways and means – mght be popular and get movement there.  



P.M. 	Don’t mind that.



P.M.	Cd. we consider also Anglo-U.S. convns. re Canal.



A.E.	U.S. won’t be anxious – they have pressed me to give way on Sudan.



P.M.	But make it clear to U.S. we can’t carry this burden alone for ever, and tht. E. shdn’t get it.



		*  Agreed.





		7.	The Murderous Usurper of Kalba.



A.E.	Sheikh of Muscat (our pal) wants him out.  He will go – but only on a show of force.  We are staging that.  There might be some fighting – but by accident – not design.



P.M.	See that we [they] win any battle.





		8.	Transport.



P.M.	Our policy shd. be expansion and enfranchisement of road transport, while m’taining life of rlways.  H. Morrison’s speech suggested there mght not be such gt. differences.



	Rlways.  Levy + reform (efficiency and pruning of redundancies).

	Let rlways operate buses via unprofitable rail services.

	We must bear no ill-will twds. rlways.  But can’t in their interest cramp their expanding future.



L.	Not sure tht. “strategic” importance of rlways isn’t over-played.



P.M.	Fixed interest on stock is a dreadful mill-stone – cpd. with private enterprise wh. can write down its capital.



L.	Seeing Hurcomb this pm.  Shd. I talk on fares or on W. Paper.



P.M.	Open W. Paper with him – on basis it isn’t finally approved by Cab.



L.P.	Yes – esp. in view of leakage in today’s Press.



Sw.	This emphasises need for early publn of W. Paper.



P.M.	I wd. like it finally approved by Cttee and published, w’out delay.



L.	H. wants to bring T.U. Deputy Chairman with him.  



W.M.  	A good man.



P.M.	Let him come – no more – but in confidence.



Sw.	Aim at publicn on Monday.



		Agreed :	Leathers to report on Thursday result of his talk 			with Hurcomb., with a view to publicn. next 				week. (prob. not so soon as Monday) and prs. 			Thursday.

				Lobby Conference on day before publn.

			

 L.P.	Worth explaining it also to Transport Cttee of H/C.

Sw.	Debate in H/L. cd. be arranged, if desired, while H/C. occupied with Finance Bill.

			 

P.M.	Will be pressure for early Debate in H/C.



W.M.	When shd. we talk to T.U.’s concerned?  Not at once.  But L. might sound Benstead.  Shd. talk soon after publn.

	

	Fares.



L.	H. may co-operate or may need direction.  Assume we are ready to direct.  



P.M.  	Certainly.



L.	When do you want changes in fares to take effect?  



L.P. 	Not until after 15/5.  



L. 	Wait until London change?  



P.M. 	Too long?

	

L. 	Try for both simultaneously in June

							[Enter B-H. and P.M.G.



		9.	B.B.C. Charter.



L.P.	Explained his compromise.



H.C.	Plan to give a day in H/C. before Whitsun.



P.M.	What will happen on a Divn.?



B-H.	This compromise makes it a bit easier with anti. sponsors.  But can’t judge until that view becomes vocal and letters of protest come in v. tampering with B.B.C.  After publn. it mght be put to 1922 Cttee.



P.M.	Wd. have preferred to p’pone for 2 years.



B-H.	Cdn’t avoid trouble that way – pro. sponsors wd. make trouble.



P.M.G.	B.B.C. will be allowed to erect 5 new stations before any new co. can start.  This means 4 or 5 years’ delay before it can come before Parlt.  This arises fr. statement tht. B.B.C. must first be allowed to fulfil its p’mme.



A.E.	This doesn’t give pro. sponsors v. much.  



P.M.G. 	Profumo and his friends will stand to this deal.

L.P.S.	If Labour and Lib. oppose this : 15-20 anti. sponsor enthusiasts will dish the Govt.  Why not talk to some of these?



L.P.	Offer of 2nd opportunity of Parly. discussion shd. satisfy them.



M-F.	This is a compromise : must put Whips on : can’t have free vote on a compromise wh. we have worked out.



P.M.	Amend para. 8 to read “the first licence” vice “a licence”.



H.C.	Wd. prefer a debate on each licence separately.



P.M.G.	The pro. sponsors wdn’t accept that.  Tried it on.



P.M.	Shd. Cantuar be brght into this controversial area?



L.P.	Lord Chamberlain or Pres. of R. Society?



L.P.S.	Delete Cantuar and Sc. Judge.



H.C.	Substitute Speaker for Cantuar.  Generally agreed.



P.M.	No casting vote.  Delete the 2 Judges.  Substitute Speaker for Cantuar.

	After discn. – agreed to retain 2 Judges.  Agreed.



	Publication : to be delayed for at least one week after Transport.



P.T.	Put it to 1922 Cttee tht. this is best compromise we can get : if full support not guaranteed on 3 line Whip only alternative is to p’pone for 2 yrs.



P.M.	Must not allow 1922 Cttee to decide.

	Cd. we put out a W. Paper for discussion?  



L.P.  	No.  30/6.



L.P.	Cd. omit “commercial” in para. 6.



L.P.S.	Won’t get you out of your difficulty.



H.C.	We shall be branded as the Govt. wh. first accepted principle of sponsored p’mmes.



P.M.	Publish it – and see what criticism it evokes.



L.P.S.	Then tone down para. 6 in case we have to run out.



P.M.	You may say this week it will be publd. in week after next.



							[Exit B-H., P.M.G.

		10.	Italian Labour in Mines.



L.	As in memo.



P.M.	Don’t have a row about this.



R.A.B.	Ques. of principle – eg. Manchr. Guardian article.



G.H.	Increase in Br. recruitment (v. satisfy.) makes it easier to beat.





		11.	Unemployment in Textile Industries.		[Exit G.Ll.



R.A.B.		Assheton’s  amendmt. to be accepted.          Agreed.
