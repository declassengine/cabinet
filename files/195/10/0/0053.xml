	a)  No and propn. of troops was then crucial point in demilitn.  b) India mght be ready to compromise.  c) Graham shd. try again.

	Graham went out; but left w’out agreemt. on a). Pak. got v. emotional about it.  Quieter now : but p. opinion v. excitable.

	Zaffrulah wants G. to come back and negotns. to be resumed, w’out return to Sec. Council.  We and U.S. pressed G. to return : but he won’t and has gone to N. Yk. spkg. of a “new approach”.  No rept. of his mtgs. there.
