P.M.	Staggered by cost - £1.1 m.



J.P.L.T.	Estimated before seeing vessel (wh. was abroad).  V. bad shot.  Much more work than supposed.  Also Palace have asked for v. expensive decorations : and King’s doctors’ demand for air conditioning plant.

	Overtime.



P.M.	Blame rests with late Govt.  But consider interests of Crown.

	We are committed to this.



R.A.B.	Asked Ty. to raise this with Palace.  Agreed cdn’t cancel the liner.

	But gross disregard for public money.



P.M.	Ministers must be responsible – “Palace” can’t come into this.

	Suggn. tht. A. and N.Z. mght share the cost.  Cab. shd. consider carefully there will be a row here.  But Labour Ministers responsible – can’t affect Crown.  But if we ask A. and N.Z. to share, in joint responsibility – and put a tax on what was honoured visit.  Mght. start up controversy in A. and N.Z.  Mustn’t involve Crown in that.

	V. grave risk.

	Suppose they decline and it leaks.

	Can’t be a row here because Labour can’t start it.

	Mght. be a row in A. and N.Z. Parlts.



R.A.B.	Canadian precedent.  Ask them if they cd. pay w’out a row.



A.E.	Ask if they wd. care to contribute.  They mght cover him after ???? passes Equator.



S.	Not worth the risk for under £200.000.  Diff. if they had bn. asked earlier.

	Use of our counter sanctions wd. create chaos in E. and land us in grter diffies. includg. respons. for Cairo and Alex.

	Hence recommns. in para 10.



C.I.G.S.	We agree.

	Want to avoid addl. commitments.

	One addl. sanction : power to disarm E. Police, when they think it necessary.

	They wd. do it : but wd. like to authorise them.



Sal.	Will 10(a) + disarming Police suffice to check terrorism.

	Para. 9 of memo. suggests continuous deterioration.



A.E.	Goes up and down.



P.M.	Pig it : take a chance : don’t be too scrupulous about the law.



C.I.GS.	Don’t want Erskine sued.  Will pass Act of Indemnity.

	ii) Short term proposal in memo.



M.F.	Verify ct. didn’t say they had taken it into a/c when passing sentence.



P.M.	OK so far as it goes.  But I want to do more.  Want to release a few eminent people like Manstein quickly.  To evoke natl. response from Germany.



A.E.	Prefer to get rid of it altogether under (i).



M.F.	Support (i) in principle.  Means transferring powers of clemency from S. of S. to an internatl. body.



P.M.	Approve these so far as they go.

	But give me a list of prominent Generals and others 	who wd. remain in jug after (ii), before action under (ii) 	taken.



H.C.	Don’t ignore U.K. feeling v. these men.  Many people think they deserved all they got.



I.	May I tell Canada.  They have 3 and shd. follow our line.
