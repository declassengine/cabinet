C.M. 97(52).			                                       13th November, 1952 (5.30 p.m.).



	1.	Town &amp; Country Planning Act, 1947.	[Enter  Sw., Solr.Genl.,

				            Galbraith.

H.M.	3 points of substance only are out-standing.

	(i)	How to end d. charge?  End as we began:  not to apply to opns

		begun after 18.11.52.	Agreed.

	(ii)	Compulsy acquisition.  May be said tht. developmt mght. be 

		held up etc.  Want to say that safeguard v. this is comp. acquisn.

		But want to avoid too truculent a tone.  Hence re-draft.  Can 

		defend comp. purchase when large tract is to be bought &amp; part

		of it re-sold to a no. of people for private developmt.



Sal.	Wd have liked a ceiling for p. authy selling price to private developer.

		Cd be monopoly price.  Can’t trust publ. authy to sell always at

		a fair price.  E.g. require them to sell at a price no higher than

		they bought at.



H.M.	Yes:  it is their duty to sell at market price.  In long Bill we will take 

		power by Reg. to require them to sell at “fair” prices.



M-B.	(iii)	Paras. 36-7.  Is it necessary to refer to ‘encouragement’ of comp.

		purchase .  E.g. in 37 final sentence cd. be amended as in words

		given.



R.A.B.	(iv)	Para. 39.  Add, at end, “Safeguards must be introduced to 

		prevent abuse of a system under wh. admn rests with l.a.’s

		and cost falls wholly on Exchequer?”  I will suggest precise

		form of words.	Agreed.



H.M.	(v)	Must disclose our intentions re unscrambling.  Ty. dissents are

		on this.



R.A.B.	a)	Shd we recover fr. developers etc.  No.  We cdn’t	} 

		get more than £2 m.			}  Agreed.

	b)	Shd paymts. be made when developmt has occurred	}

		&amp; charge has bn. paid.  Yes.  Involves £6 m.		}

	The whole thing may cost £60 m. in ’54.  (H.M. says £30-35 m.)

		Tho’ I save £300 m.



H.M.	On a) we can’t recover:  we shd. ????? penalise those who followed

		Govt. policy.  Welcome (b).



P.M.	Presentation:  as liberating measure.



Sw.	Socialist theory was fallacy because dev. charge wd. never have brght.

		in anything like £300 m.



M-B.	(vi) Para. 5 last sentence contemplates paymt. of compn to people who

		haven’t made out a claim on the £300 m.  Why shd we pay them?

H.M.	Because these are small men who have bn. swindled out of the claim.

		We want to bring claim &amp; land together.			Consult.



				[Exit  H.M. &amp; M-B.	



	2.	Government Information Services.



R.A.B.	1364 to 864 redn in C.O.I.  Use central agency when it is more useful

		than Dpts.  Aim at more reduction of contracting out:  tho’

		Savings movemt. won’t abandon their publicity.



Sal.	It is an economy to use central agency.  Shd. be a bias against 

		contracting out.



Sw.	I wd. make all Dpts. use it – with special saving for Ty!
