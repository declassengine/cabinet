C.C. 75(52).				31st July, 1952.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  Sw., B.H.



H.C.	Business for wk. after Recess.





	2.	Legislative Programme.



H.C.	Main point:  must know at outset of Session what we intend to pass.

		Shd get Bills ready.  Final decns not until Oct.  But let’s be firm

		then.

	Transport &amp; Steel are firm.  What else?  i) Monopolies – promised 

		this Session, but no policy yet.  Shall look foolish if we don’t

		do it next Sessn.  ii) Leasehold.  iii) Development Charge.  Both

		these involve standstill Bills – and those, w’out announcemt. of

		alternative policies, will make us seem to know not what we 

		intend.  Much to be said for takg. main Bills on ii) &amp; iii) wh.

		cd. go upstairs.



H.M.	I want both standstill &amp; main Bill produced together – certainly

		on (iii).



Sal.	We H/L. don’t get T. &amp; S. until summer:  diff. for H/L. to do one

		or even two more major Bills.  Don’t overload H/L. p’mme

		for June/July.



H.M.	Final H/L. stages cd. be taken in spill-over in autumn.



Sw.	T. &amp; C. Planning is more important than Monopolies.



P.T.	Monopolies:  policy is settled, save for natd industries.

			Developmt. Charge:  Memo. to come to Cab. in

			about 3 wks.



P.T.	Wd like a decn wtr. Monopolies is in or out for next Session.

				[Exit  B.H.

				[Enter  J.T. &amp; L.B.

	3.	Suez Canal.



	Memo. approved.





	4.	Egypt.



A.E.	Ali Maher looks as tho’ he may be able to control military.

	Flail:  C’s-in-C. makg. a fuss about it.  Knock him off it.  Must

		keep it at 48 hrs.



Al.	O.K. pro tem.  Can’t do it indefinitely.	[Exit  L.B. &amp; J.T.

	5.	East/West Trade.



P.T.	U.S. pressing us to w’hold these supplies.  Craven Bros. row.  They		now seek guidance on delivery of goods contracted for before

		end  50.  Commercial consns point to allowg. this:  we have 

		large adverse balance with R. &amp; want coarse grains.  U.S.

		over-estimate amount of prior commitmts – only $1.5 m. in fact.

		A.E. &amp; I recommend we shd. supply those, on basis in memo.



O.L.	I spoke in Sep. ’50.  Cravens make largest machine tools (one of

		2 makers) wh. can be used for munitions.  We can’t export the

		tools wh. I mentioned in my speech:  they really mean 

		munitions (large tanks &amp; guns).  Esp. after Labour Govt. stopped 		them, on a/c of our pressure.



Ch.	Para. 14.  Look at what we risk losing.



P.M.	I am hopelessly committed.  My b’cast on 26.8.50.

		Labour Govt. yielded to our view.



A.E.	Misunderstanding – needs re-considn.



R.A.B.	I said in my speech – i) consult other nations  ii) don’t damage our

		own interests  iii) avoid increasg. war potential of our enemies.	Thght. this memo. met me.

	Cd it apply to all save Craven Bros., who are notorious.



P.T.	Goods clearly of strategic value are out anyway.



O.L.	But planing machines (armour plate) wh. cd. be used for one

		purpose or another, shd. be v. carefully scrutinised.



P.T.	Approve general policy, subject to exception for Craven

		Bros. and similar tools.

		Let me discuss list with O.L. and D.S. and make 

		specified recommns.



A.E.	No Craven Bros. tools.  Nothing late Govt. vetoed.

		Subject to that, make a list of prior commitments which

		cd. go.



P.M.	And bring it up to Cab. again.



					      [Enter  Att.G.

	6.	Immunities for International Organisations.



Sim.	Att.G. has taken narrow “legal” view.  V. diff. to confine it to that in

		relation to internatl obligns, which are not enforceable by any 			court.  E.g. on N.A.T.O. Att.G. says we aren’t commd because

		tho’ we have signed we haven’t ratified.  In fact we put the 

		agreemt. forwd. &amp; presided over group wh. discussed.  We have 

		all the advantages, now it’s in Paris:  we are fully committed to 

		honouring the obligation.

	In my view we are commd in respect of all – save the one which 

		hasn’t bn. set up.



Att.G.	Thought Cab. wd. wish to know wtr. we are legally bound or not.

		That’s why I was careful not to take pol. consns into a/c.

	E.g. Postal Union:  we aren’t bound in my view.  May be good policy

		to honour it.



A.E.	I shall argue to-day on Germany we are bound:  tho’ for political

		reasons we ask Parlt. to discuss &amp; ratify.



H.C.	Several of us argued the other way in Opposn – incldg. Sw. and 

		both L.O.’s.



Sw.	But para. 2 of 262 was never explained to me.



Sim.	Art. 7 provides for action in event of abuse of privilege.



P.M.	U. Postal Union.  Has gone on for 70 yrs.  Why give immunity now?



Sim.	Because at our instance a conventn was made to secure uniformity for

		all and to some extent cut down existg. immunities.



H.C.	If the true posn were explained as in 262 when this comes up again

		in H/C. I wd. be prepd to eat my earlier words.

			

			Memo. approved.

			A.E. to report new ????.		[Exit  Att.G.





	7.	Colonial Questions.



		Memo. approved.		[Exit  A.E.





	8.	Wages Policy.



W.M.	1)	Refce back to Wages Councils  }  are having some

	2)	N.C.B. refusal of wage claim.  }   effect.

	To-day engineering employers have to decide on £2 p. wk. claim.

		They have told me they wd. like to take firm line, but don’t want

		to risk losing good will of Unions.  I have said, if outbrk. unoffl

		strikes, we wd. not intervene.  But if regular Unions approach us,

		for arbitrn etc., I have staty oblign to intervene if normal

		machinery is exhausted.

	Ministerial statements.  Employers are v. sensitive.  Ask Ministers

		to avoid saying anythg. wh. mght. encourage idea tht. any

		wage increases wd. be justified.



L.	Miners – arbitrn is open:  miners are considerg. it.



R.A.B.	We shd. support M/L.	{Exit  Sw.

				{Enter A.H., de L., D.S.



	9.	Deferment of Apprentices.



W.M.	Agree in principle:  ready to discuss methods.



Al.	Don’t agree:  we are v. short of technicians.  Smaller our Services

		become, more technicians we want.

	Also, dangerous to encroach on universality.



W.M.	Para. 3 last sentence – safeguards Services.  I want to preserve that.



D.S.	Apprentices are a national resource like steel.  Shd be allocated

		acc. to national need.  Get away from assumptn tht. Services

		have 1st claim on their skill.  Retention of skilled men is 

		essential to secure emplt. of unskilled men available.

	Agree we can’t have 2 diff. methods.



A.H.	D.S. deferment is really exemption.  Apart fr. that, we cd. agree.

		16.000 coming back fr. Army this year.



P.M.	“Immediate reserve” of tradesmen.



Al.	Want them in peace e.g. R.E.M.E. &amp; R.A.F.

	Let Serv. Dpts. discuss with M/L. and M/S. detailed scheme.



D.S.	Urgency.



W.M.	If it follows existg. scheme it can come into opn at once.  Only ques.

		is “indefinite”:  only 3% so far have refused.



D.S.	Ready to discuss that.  But we must have more latitude than under 

		super-priority – discriminatg. acc. to export work.



W.M.	Cdn’t defend that.

			

			{ Agree in principle – urgent action – method to be
