C.C. 50(52)							7th May 1952



		1.	Broadmoor.				[Enter A.H. de L’isle



H.C.	Small – quick report – on adequacy of security arrangements.

	Chairman – lawyers.  Medical assessor.  Two other members eg. senior M.P.’s



P.M.	Wd. have preferred to see it go back to H.O.

	Need we settle this today.



H.C.	Don’t want to announce today.





		2.	Germany : Contractual Negotiations.



A.E.	K.’s views circulated.

	Don’t think stiffening G. attitude due to R. move.  But i) realisn of cost of re-armament.  For E.D.C. Forces (10 Divns. and T.A.F.) will cost as much as Hitler’s highest def. budget in ’38.  ii) Industrialists, who are doing v. well, aren’t keen : wd. rather compete with us etc.  iii) The relns. are quite harsh to G. because not a Peace Treaty.



	K. now thinks G. mood is steadier and hopes for sign by end/May.

	U.S. have insisted on many condns. eg. de-cartelisation, wh. is unpopular with G.  Wd. help if we cd. get U.S. to relax on this.  Also on repns: we shan’t get any more : that is French point of pressure.

	May have to ask Cab. to authorise relaxn. or concessns. in next 2 wks.

	War Criminals : G. want Allied custody, but G. clemency. I will circulate a memo. on that ques.



P.M.	Hope you will be able to pull it off.



		Note taken.





		3.	German Financial Contribution to Defence.



A.E.	Hope no addl. burden until June ’53 –or anyway March.  But after tht. we shall have to carry internal costs of our Occupn.  V. serious financial problem.  Inevitable.



R.A.B.	Most important to our future.  We can’t stand £130 m. in overseas expenditure.

	Warning to U.S. foreshadows cutting down.  But public statement at same time committg. us to keeping troops in Europe.  Not quite consistent. 



A.E.	Aim of warning to U.S. is to get U.S. aid.  Wd. breach all our undertakgs. to w’draw our Forces fr. Europe.

Ch.	Sceptical of figure.  G. overvalue price eg. of houses etc. supplied.

	Also 1.26 G. employed to every B. soldier – cost £810 p.a. each.

	If £130 m, much wd. be paid in sterling if we empld. B. vice G.

	Grim : but not prs. so grim as it seems.



R.A.B.	Am circulatg. memo. on economy – we are debtor nation and yet shouldering overseas mil. commitmts. 10 times as gt. as pre-war.



P.M.	Will be better off if we bring down whole structure of W. Defence Maximum economy.  But no change in policy of m’taining. troops in E.



R.A.B.	Don’t suggest major change in policy.  But we must look ahead and see how we can sustain our posn. w’out U.S. aid.



A.E.	Costs are v. diff. to judge.  G. and U.S. are pressing us to reduce our costs.

	U.S. are cutting down eg. on amenities for U.S. troops.



A.H.	Challenge Prof’s figure.  Includes labour on works p’mmes now completed.

	We can make some economies, but not v. much.  G. is only good station	B. Army has, and they are all abroad.  They live better there than here.



Ch.	152.000 G. labour now empld. 



A.H.  	Have cut – only 115.000 now, incldg. all those in formed units in uniform.



A.E.	We have until March and prob. June ’53 to make up our minds.

	No harm m’while in warning Acheson.

	We are commd. to 4 Divns. in G. and we have them : plus 2 in reserve in U.K. – which we haven’t.



P.M.	A.H. to see Ch. and agree on the figures.



A.E.	Also consider how far it is in our interests to use more Br. in the tail.  



A.H. 	Blunts the teeth : as we have no tail people available here to go out.



P.M.	Works p’mmes?  



A.H. 	Mostly married quarters etc.  And almost all is finished.  



deL. 	But m’while other costs eg. airfields are going up.



W.M.	Para.9.  One or two firms with priority say they may have to discharge some men we have supplied to them.  H. Page are keeping some key men only to save us embarrassment.

Sal.	Canada – h’to has paid own expenses : tho’ capital cost has come out of our share of Occupn.  Budget.   If they are now asked to pay capital, they wd. be paying both that and m’tenance wh. others aren’t doing.



P.M.	G. cd. be asked to pay for houses wh. they will have in the end.  



Ch.  	They are paying now: and by ’53 we shan’t want any more built.



P.M.	At this stage no indication of any change of policy.

		

R.A.D.	Must review all our overseas mil. commitments.

	M’while can carry on for 6 months.

	Wd. prefer to look at G. occupn. costs in that larger context.



P.M.		{M/Def. (Chairman) Prof. Swinton, F.O. Minister, Ty. repve. – calling 		{Service Ministers into consultns. – to review G. costs and aim at 			{getting proposals for reducg. cost to about £70 m. when it falls on us. 	

		{Agreed.



								[Exit A.E. A.H. de L.

		4.	B.B.C. Charter.			[Enter P.M.G., B.H.



L.P.	Alterations wh. make it easier to retreat, if need be. Paras. 6, 7

	(“some element of competn. may well be …”).  Also don’t ask Parlt. to commit themselves.



O.L.         *	Para. 7 last sentence shd. be limited to television – eg. add “in this field”.



J.S.	Nothing can happen in this Parlt.  Our object shd. be to leave it to the next.



P.M.	If it proves generally unacceptable, we cd. renew existg. Charter for 2 yrs.



R.A.B.	Consider alternative : abandon sponsoring on practical grounds : lose 70 or so of our supporters and push it thro’ with Opposn. support.

	Disadvantage of this course – slightly dishonest, obvious pol. compromise.



P.M.	We shd. expose ourselves to risk tht. Opposn. wd. find a means of defeating us – on some ingenious amendment.

	V. serious to rely on Opposn. to carry measures disliked by large section of Govt. supporters.



Sw.	This is not disingenuous – we make clear the practical limitns. and leave the decision to a future Parlt.



R.A.B.	But many of us believe in m’taining present monopoly of B.B.C.

O.L.	I am an anti-sponsor, but I can swallow last sentence of P.7.



Sal.	This is about the best we can do.



M-F.	I agree with that view.



P.M.G.	{Second sentence of para. 7 will affront pro-sponsors.  Delete it.



P.M.	{L.P. should see again the men with whom he reached his “bargain”.  {Agreed.

       *	{Govt. spokesman in H/C. : M. Fyfe.

	{Report on x/ on Tuesday, with further revised proof.



							[Exit P.M.G.

		5.	Legislative Programme.		[Enter D.S. and G.Br.



H.C.	As in memo.



Sal.	I have agreed to this.  But my advisers say one month in H/L. is not enough.  Can’t see other way of completing before Xmas.



H.C.	In gt. need we cd. have a week or so in Jan. (para. 7).



Sal.	That wd. help.  Socialists treated H/L. pretty well on time.



P.M.	Take Alternative B. but advance (push it fwd.) by one week.



		Agreed :  H.C. and Sal. to work out new plan on that basis.



	Steel Bill.



H.C.	Plan of using Standing Cttee.  Don’t want time table in Cttee. – only Labour Govt. has done that.  Majority of 3 doesn’t guarantee success of Govt. views.  Even if we accept these disadvantages it wd. be necessary to meet on 30/9 to get it thro’ and also to sit in January.



P.M.	Wild gamble.

                x/.	I had assumed Steel wdn’t be introduced until Transport has gone up to H/Lords.

	Consider resoln. enabling sick to be replaced.



H.C.	Cdn’t come after.  H/L. cdn’t finish it in that event.



P.M.	Why not carry over?



H.C.	No precedent save for a hybrid Bill, and only one for that effectively.

	Tho’ in 1919 Bonar Law proposed but w’drew motion to carry over a Bill continuing war legn.



O.L.	Pol. advantages in doing Steel a little later.

D.S.	No : wiser to let new system settle down before another Election.  More likely then tht. Labour wd. not make re-nationn an electoral issue.



O.L.	That problem will continue so long as a no. of shares remain unsold.



Sw.	No point in starting this unless you can see it thro’ H/Lds.



P.M.	Agree : and can’t do that w’out a carry over.



D.S.	Alternative : 2nd Rdg. after Whitsun and Standing Cttee to get thro’ H/C. before summer recess.  



P.M. 	Much too dangerous to put it in Cttee w’out replacement of sick.



		Agreed :  	Don’t decide today, but no prospect of passing

				this Bill in current session.

							

							[Exit G.B. and D.S.

		6.	Industrial Disputes – Newspapers.



W.M.	Dispute is likely to spread in course of next few days.

	Thompson’s won’t discuss with Unions.

	Propose appointmt. of Ct. of Enquiry into origins and nature of dispute.

	After current consultns. are over.

	We have no power to bowl him over.

	Report of Enquiry wd. be laid before Parlt.  Newspaper Socy etc. will prob. come out critically against Thompson.
