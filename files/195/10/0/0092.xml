C.M. 82(52).				30th September, 1952.



	1.	Korea.		[Exit  Sw. &amp; G.Ll.



A.E.	Proposals well received here.  Put Comms in some diffy.

	Para. 4 only point for Cab. to-day.  No decision now.  Look at it

		again in light of Comm. receptn of other proposals.  They offer

		better chance of agreemt.  But on offers made we stand quite 

		well.  Let Cab. turn it over m’while.



			Agreed.





	2.	Trieste.



A.E.	Long discns with Gasperi &amp; Tito.  Time won’t heal this.  Wd loom

		large in Ital. elections in spring – Comm. mght. gain &amp; make

		settlemt. more diff.

	Racial diffy:  in B. 3 Ital towns tho’ hinterland Slovene.  There

		are Sl. in hint of A.  Zoll also in Slovene.  Considering swops –

		but convinced now it’s too complicated – towns depend on

		hinterland:  Slovene corridor thro’ Zoll wd. be v. diff.  Only

		chance is to get settlement on Zones as they are.  Tried to 

		persuade T. to give Capodistria to Italy, but he cdn’t agree.

	Have told results to U.S.  Courses a) say together tht. Y. &amp; It. must

		take it.  Tito wd. Italy doubtful.  b) merely to recommend, w’out

		pressure.  I wd. have preferred a):  but at Election time U.S.

		wdn’t go along with it.  Must be content with (b).



			           Agreed:  best we can do.





	3.	Yugoslavia.



A.E.	Steady evoln twds. w. form of adminn (away fr. Commn).   

		In some ways already to right of Socialists.  E.g. bonus on 

		output, profit-sharing schemes.  Will circulate report.

	Private ownership of land.

	They told us of Soviet technique on Satellites.  They choose

		2 members of Cab., say they aren’t trustworthy, &amp; Sat. P.M.

		dismisses them.  Then 2 more &amp; so on, until all are out.  They

		tried it in Yugoslavia:  “when we resisted, the break came.”

	They certainly want to work with us.

	Tito seems popular &amp; not in fear of his life.

	He wd. like to come here.  Suggested next spring Mar/Apl. – 

		informally, not as Head of State (wh. he is likely to become

		in Jan.).







	4.	Austria.



A.E.	A. ready to sign any Treaty, to get R. out.

	Wd be good if we cd. persuade U.S. &amp; Fr. to say we will sign either

		Treaty, long or short.

	Clear that R. won’t sign at all - every sign tht. they will remain for

		ever.



P.M.	Look at this again after U.S. Election.



A.E.	But Austria, as elsewhere in Europe, much less feeling of tension.

	No one seems impressed by Satellite armies – ill-equipped.



P.M.	Believe estimates of R. strength are exaggerated.  Want to test it by

		reference to steel, &amp; key materials.



A.E.	Saw Genl. Collins (U.S. C.O.S.).  He favoured our Trieste solution, 

		but feared U.S. Govt. cdn’t back (a).  He spoke too of U.S.

		staff talks with Yugosl.  Tito wd. have preferred to see Br. offr.,

		but we can’t change that now.

	Albania:  Tito said we cd. have snipped it off in ’41.  But now we must

		have plans prepd in advance.  But note tht. Albania-Yugosl.-

		Greek link-up is anti-Italian.

	Comm. split in France:  Tito thght. it most important event since Y.

		defection.





	5.	Persia.



P.M.	Proposed joint reply to M.   Answer?



A.E.	Not from Truman:  bad reaction from State Dpt.  Tel. 1884.

		Read F.O. reply to this.



P.M.	I approve that.



P.M.	We can’t prevent U.S. giving M. money.  But we won’t give him any

		of the £49 m:  &amp; let him stew.

	But Alton Jones &amp; other cos.  I’m told the little cos. cdn’t save Persia.

		We cdn’t intercept U.S. tankers by force:  but they wdn’t get

		much w’out the large cos.



L.	If U.S. Govt. lifted the embargo, it wd. be a pity – tho’ the big cos. wd.

		take some time to get moving.



G.Ll.	In Grand Jury procdgs. it was said on behalf of Govt. tht. one of the

		purposes was to open compn betwn. cos. in “Persian &amp; other”

		oil – we protested at once thro’ Embassy.





	6.	Oil:  Grand Jury Proceedings in U.S.A.



A.E.	Will Cab. approve Annex A.

	Dutch propose to take same line.



			Approved.		[Exit  G.Ll.



 

 	7.	Wages:  Engineering Industry.



H.M.	Employers are reluctant to start talking on a figure.  Will have to be

		general to start with:  they are v. coy.



P.M.	Employers must be discouraged from returning a flat negative.
