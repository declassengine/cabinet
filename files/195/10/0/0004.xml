	Will then send to other Ministers.



P.T.	Do other parts of speech cover other cuts?  e.g. 44% on social services.

	Changes in policy as well as economy in admn. 



R.A.B.	Thght. we agreed we cdn’t go into big policy ques. before Tuesday.

	See last sentence. Will come up on Estimates.



P.T.	Shall be pressed in debate.



R.A.B.	Will try to make it clear tht. old fashioned function of Ty. is to be restored.

	On policy can’t be specific now.  But will say policy changes are not excluded.  



P.T. 	The whole field included and changes in policy are not excluded.  We shd. say so, before we’re challenged.



R.A.B.	Will try to meet this – w’out makg. idle threats.



O.L.	Omit “announce our measures as soon as determined”.  Shall be asked when, continually.  



R.A.B. 	I agree.



R.A.B.	Stockpiling.  Ty. have seen Rpt.

R.A.B.	Make our Estimates a reality – Dpts. co-operatg.



P.M.	“Nov. Cabinets” = Estimates for followg. year.  This is the month for Ty., who can put up conflicts to Cabinet.



R.A.B.	Statement on div. limn. and E.P.T.

	W’out remarks by me, might be taken to approve old W. Paper.

	Intend to say that’s dead, but appeal to firms for restraint in distributing profits.

	E.P.T. Await Budget.  Don’t want to say it will be retrospective from 1.1.51. – even if questioned.  Ty. want it mentioned not unorthodox to do so.  But I’m for not saying it.



P.M.	See F.B.I. etc. and tell them to be restrained.



R.A.B.	Proposing to see them and T.U.C. on morrow of speech.  Will then give F.B.I. the tip.



O.L.	There is somethg. to be said for warning tht. retrospectn is not excluded, at least.



R.A.B.	Cd. say tht. this sort of tax often starts from 1/1.



P.M.	Avoid criticism of retrospectn.  Mention 1st Jan.  Agreed.



R.A.B.	Bank rate.  Shan’t mention to Cab. again.  Will talk to P.M.

	L.a. loans.  Means review of housing subsidies, wh. will take some time. Want only to make genl. statement tht. we will give compensation for increased interest on housing loans.



	½% endorsed by O.L. and others.



H.M.	L.a.’s – don’t want criticism tht. our first act is to raise rents – esp. as we aren’t likely to raise many houses.

	But R.A.B. has a v. ingenious formula wh. meets this diffy.

	Promise review of formula for housing subsidy.

	We shall have trouble : but think this will do.

	Capital subsidy takg. a/c of increased loan cost : muddle it all up so nobody knows how we’ve done it.

	Cab. shd. agree not to have increased rents.  Leave method to me and Ch./Ex.



J.S.	Want it said tht. we won’t allow rents to rise on this a/c.

	Take care, however, because they are rising on a/c of m’tenance costs.

	Mustn’t allow Ch./Ex. guarantee to cover tht. also.



H.M.	They will press for that as soon as subsidy is re-opened.





		5.	Coal.				[Enter G.Ll., Maclay. D.S. &amp; R.



L.	½ m. tons is physical limit – can’t get more in now in time.  Tho’ 1 m. wd. have bn. better.

	Have entered a claim with O.E.E.C. for current qur.

	Competes with other Dpts. on shipping unless more U.S. mothball ships can be got out.  No escape fr. that.  May get some out of Fr. allotment = ships now en route for their a/c.



W.	Freights will be raised?

L.	Tendency to that – tho’ O.E.E.C. try to hold agreed rate.



Ch.	Any saving in ships fr. reduced stockpiling? 



 L.  	Not this type of ship.



D.S.	Last year’s opn. cut into iron ore, unpopular cargo.  Must draw Cab. attn. to serious consequence if this is shipped at expense of iron ore.

	16½ m. tons capacity.  P’mme cut to 16 m. because of raw materials shortage.



P.M.	Steel from U.S. wd. help. Uses only 1/6th shipping cpd. ore carrying.



L.	Mothball ships wd. be additional.	

	We cdn’t man them.  Remainder need repair.  30 p. month is causg. them gt. trouble.



D.S.	We assume 500.000 t. steel fr. U.S. in p’mme.  Now looks like only 100.000 in 1st qur.



P.M.	Small addl. amount of steel wd. be big relief to iron ore shipmts.



L.	Can’t guarantee this is enough, or tht. I can get it in.



Ch.	1% of output added to stock wd. have obviated this.



G.Ll.	Cost : £4 m. for ½ m. tons includg. freight.



P.M.	Must meet this immediate emergency. But make it clear this was necessary to avert crisis clearly coming.  Try for more finished steel fr. U.S.



     	*    L. to provide a para. for Speech, showing where we took over.



O.L.	May affect lifting of W. African oil seed crop.



J.S.M.	Cd. have bn. done in summer w’out dislocn.



R.A.B.	Cd. Cab. see a Coal Budget.

	Coal exports level has not bn. restored.

	U.S. want us to re-ship coal to Sweden to stop them sending ball bearings etc. to behind curtain.



P.T.	Coal and steel vital to our trade negotns. This will worsen our bargaining posn.



G.LL.	Level of exports can’t be reduced – offls. recommend it be raised by 2 m. next year.  Leaves deficit of 6 m. tons.  Outlook is bad.



P.M.	Full statement on coal posn. in H/C. by G. Lloyd. and by	}  *

	L. in H/L.  During debate on Address.  As for meat. 		}  *

	30 minutes each.  Let W. give me a short para. on 

	meat for my speech.

	Shipping may need a statement too.



		Agreed : ½ m. tons to be imported fr. U.S.A.



W.	Will affect food, esp. fats.  We must try to avoid worst consequences.

D.S.	Outlined content of direction.  Standstill order.



P.M.	Leaving Hardie where he is, but frozen?



D.S.	Line Evans Plan will come in with the legn.

	No advantage in altering composn. of Bd. just before it is to be abolished.  Cdn’t get people to serve  on moribund body.



P.M.	The Cttee. on re-armament, comprising a man who asked for guarantee tht. existg. managements wd. not be disturbed.

	Dirn. shd. come to Cab.



H.C.	I can read it out.  (Did so.)



D.S.	Announce it this week, after consultg. Bd. as required.

	May I issue Tuesday.
