C.M. 11(51).				1st February, 1951.



	1.	Parliament.                                   [Enter  W.W., N.B., K.Y., J.S.



H.M.	Opposn ready to give Service Supplies &amp; Cons. Fund Bill 

		on the nod, late at night.

	Supply Day on Thursday for meat.

	Iron &amp; Steel:  7/2:  M/Supply &amp; Parly. Secy.



P.M.	If beaten to-day (coal) I wd. not resign:  I wd. say the fate of a

		Govt. shd. not depend on incidence of influenza.



H.G.	Wd. you feel the same about Steel on 7/2?



P.M.	I will wait &amp; see.



H.M.	Defence Debate:  14 &amp; 15 Feby.





	2.	Govt. Buildings.



A.	Trouble in H/L. over F.O. bldg.



P.M.	I have never agreed to elevation.



H.D.	I don’t think F.O. proposn is nearly so doubtful as C.O. bldg.



J.	Don’t spoil facade.



G.T.	Decn taken years ago.  Related to Govt. occupn of flats, hotels etc.



P.M.	I will re-consider F.O. project – with plans.  (Presumably at Cab.)

					

					[Exit  W.W.

	3.	Coal.  Release of Miners from Forces.



N.B.	Recruitg. going well;  but Wiles Cttee say it can’t be m’tained.

		On their estimate, we shall have 10 m. tons deficiency on coal

		for domestic use.  Exports seriously down:  affects prices, F.O.

		interests, b/paymts.

	Scheme for releasg. miners fr. Forces is practicable.  Done in both

		wars.	 Done in 1947.  On my plan, we shan’t get more than 

		3.000.  But that = 20.000 t. p. wk.  And, more important, a big

		psychol. effect:  in keepg. men in mines, recruitg., &amp; absorbg. 

		Italians.

	We shall have to do it in the end.  T.U.C. are keen on it &amp; miners are

		pressing for a reply.  “Considered view of Genl. Council.”



P.M.	N.C.B. are v. inconsistent on man-power.

 

A.B.	I support N.B.’s view.  I don’t support proposal to import Italians.

		I don’t support Wiles.

	W’drawal of miners fr. Forces wd. enhance “status” of miners.

	But Forces will run into man-power diffies because age-groups are

		diminishg.  But balance is in favour of w’drawal.



J.S.	M/D. opposes this.  Psychol. reasons.  For admit nos. are small.

		There are only 6.000.  Wd. as many as 3.000 be willing to go?

	Decn must be taken on psychol. reasons – both ways.

	Argument against:  measures now being taken:  retaining time-expired

		regulars – re-calling reservists etc.  Damage to our recruitg. 

		campaign.  Ques. therefore of priorities.



H.G.	Both parties to this dispute exaggerate their case.

	Nos. will be quite small.

	We are accustomed to w’drawg. miners fr. Forces – on form, almost

		an index to gravity of mil. situation.

	Psychol. argument is stronger on miners’ side.  On balance therefore

		I favour w’drawal.

	Italians:  NUM have agreed.



J.G.	Ask A.B. not to express his view on this publicly for I persuaded NUM

		to accept it – after P.M. had put it to them at No. 10 mtg.



A.B.	V. well.  But let’s be careful how we go about it.



N.B.	I agree with that.

	My plan won’t apply to reservists already called up.



G.T.	Restrict this to underground workers.



A.B.	I agree with that.

		Remainder of 6(a) approved.

		Para. 6(b) approved.



J.S.	Period in mines cd. not be counted for pension w’out legn.



		Agreed:  look into this.

	Control system in paras. 4-7 approved (Annex)

		Para. 6(c) approved on that basis.





	4.	Price of Coal.



N.B.	Explained the various losses of N.C.B.

	Prodn Cttee agreed no alternative but to increase price.

	Ques:  wtr. I shd. mention it into-day’s debate?  If I don’t, must

		p’pone it for 2 wks. – it shd. date for 1/2.



P.M.	You must tell H/C.  Can’t let it dribble out 2 wks’ later.

H.M.	And must give reasons.

	But I’m disturbed at inefficiency of socd industries.

		Burden on consumer.

	Set-back to principle of public ownership.



A.V.A.	£15½ m. to improve miners’ condns.  And how does absenteeism

		stand.



A.B.	But don’t overlook rising costs of their purchases.



H.G.	Big increases in private industry for same reasons – rising costs of

		labour &amp; imported materials.



T.W.	P’pone to 1/5?  We are now at bottom of pol. trough.



H.G.	That means a still higher price then.



H.McN.	Support T.W.  Housewife’s worries now at peak.  She wd. take it

		better later, when she cd. do w’out coal.



H.G.	If you leave it until 1/5, N.C.B. will make a loss this year.

		For you wdn’t stand the much bigger increase requd on 1/5 to

		balance their accounts.



A.B.	Involves .25 increase in c/living index.



			Agreed:  announce to-day &amp; explain.

				      [Exit:  J.S. and N.B.

				   [Enter:  H. and Strang.

	5.	German War Criminals.



P.M.	Why hadn’t we heard of this?  Speech by Kirkpatrick.



H.	In accce with Govt. policy.

	He excluded Nuremburg prisoners.



H.M.	Why need he have said it?  Just when we have this trouble (with

		Party) over G. re-armament.

	Labour members are restive over K’patrick.

	Confce in Paris?



K.Y.	i)   On Europn Army:  we are there only as observers.

	ii)  Discns with Germans:  w’out commitment:  only soundings.



P.M.	Play it slow.  We have accepted only principle.

	Att.G. says K.’s speech cast doubt on justice on Nuremburg trials.



P.M.	Also Times to-day – U.S. handing back Krupps’ property “after 

		consultn with Br. &amp; French colleagues”.

	Shd. we not have bn. consulted on that too?

H.McN.	3 Power Mtg. decns re limited &amp; prohibited indies.  Presumably

		arises from that?



P.M.	A different thing.



A.B.	Cab. didn’t follow my lead when I pressed for natn of these

		industries.



H.	Indies are in hands of trustees.



P.M.	Let us have a report.





	6.	Meeting of Council of Foreign Ministers.



K.Y.	Any conclns wd. have to go wider than Germany.  Wd have to cover

		disarmament more generally……



A.B.	Pacification is first condn for disarmament.  Can’t hope for genl.

		disarmament in a world afraid.  If therefore genl. disarmt is put

		to this C.F.M., it invites breakdown.



K.Y.	You must ask:  what is cause of their fright.  And if it is armaments,

		it’s not illogical to start with that.



A.	To put it first is to begin at the wrong end.  You will get bogged

		down in it for months.



T.W.	But cd. we discuss demiln of G. w’out reference to disarmament.

	At least the 2 things shd. go together.



H.M.	Is this philosophy v. relevant?  And is 1931 a helpful analogy?

		Things were v. difft. then.

	“Pacification.”  Who is to pacify whom?

	I want C.F.M. to succeed.  Don’t pack agenda with a lot of 

		hopeless stuff.

	Demilitn of G. cd. go on Agenda:  but we wdn’t discuss it w’out

		refce to genl. armament sitn.



P.M.	Annex B. para. 2. is in fact a pretty realistic list.



H.G.	Para. 15 of Annex A is powerful statement.

	On that basis I’m sceptical of disarmament pact – for difft. reasons.

		Awkward re-actions here.  Unlimited opporties for twisting by R.

		Gt. danger of R. making specious offer &amp; we shd. look

		suspicious in rejectg. it.

	Subject to that I favour Annex B. para. 2.

	Danger of agreement wh. jeopardises our interests.  I’m inclined to 

		think best hope of peace is thro’ a stalemate rather than

		agreement.

H.W.	Para. 15 is cynical approach.

	Suggests tht. we don’t want a settlement.  “False feeling of relief” wh.

		wd. follow an agreement.

	But if public think we’re not trying they won’t support our defence

		p’mme.

	Attitude of French.  Surprised by Parodi W’ton 317 of 31/1.  Shd.

		have thght. mass of French wd. feel differently.

	Memo. suggests mil. occupn will end almost at once.  Surely it will go

		on for years, even if agreemt. reached – before Treaty finally

		concluded.

	Ques:  are we to urge G. re-armament as card to play in attempt for

		general détente.  Or are we going for it for its own sake.



J.	Shd. we breakdown on agenda or after confce.

	To preserve moral leadership, we must choose the second.

	Corollary:  don’t stand too firm on agenda lest you lose conference.



A.B.	That goes too far.  Remember our original reply on Prague

		communiqué.  We can’t have agenda narrowed down to that.

	Subject to that, I don’t dissent from genl. attitude of J.

	I’m in gt. diffy.  Distrust U.S. over this as much as over Korea.

		They are dragging us along on basis tht. 3rd War is inevitable.

	I do not accept Annexes A &amp; B.  Para. 15:  cynical &amp; defeatist.

		Assumes tht. R. wd. only use agreemt. as basis to exploit G.

		further.  This is based on assumptn tht. R. is determined to have 

		war.  A 3rd war wd. end “B. civilisation as we know it”(!).

	If we can get agreemt. with R. on anything, it wd. be big step fwd.

	If G. is re-armed, war will be on us at once.  V. naïve to assume tht.

		re-armed G. will support us.

	Unificn &amp; demilitn of G:  if we cd. get it, we shd. go for it.



H.McN.	If G. is unified, you can’t assume it will remain disarmed.

	Moral bankruptcy of this memo.



H.D.	Don’t believe E.B. wd. have passed this memo.

	He wdn’t have courted b’down on agenda.

	He never liked G. re-armament:  was reluctant to accept it even in

		principle.  Believe he wd. have tried to trade it, in a C.F.M.,

		for some solid advantage.  R. fears re-armamt. of G.

	He wd. have tried hard at C.F.M. to get success.

	Thght. we were in favour of unified Germany.

		We can’t accept view tht. unified G. wd. be a prey to Commn.

		W. Germany doesn’t tolerate Commn:  don’t believe E. Germany

		wd. tolerate it if elections were free.

	Try for agreed agenda.  Reject philosophy of Annex A.

		Chuck out some items fr. 2 of Annex B. e.g. Para. 2(a).

		Don’t discuss genl. disarmament.



H.M.	This = change of policy.



K.Y.	Cab. of 14/12.  E.B. not prepared to attend……

	Suggd now we shd. be elastic on agenda.  Are we to agree, if

		necessary, to meet on G. alone?  Hope we shall at least stand

		to our insistence on more than Germany.



P.M.	I wd. say:  ready to discuss Germany in context of genl. situation –

		e. &amp; west.



J.G.	Don’t decide at W’ton what our attitude is to be before R. reply recd.



C.E.	Don’t decide to-day – before we see R. reply.



K.Y.	But surely wise to exchange views with the other 2 – some idea 

		what we wd. adopt as agenda.

	Then we must give our repves some instructions.



P.M.	Give O.F. b’ground of our attitude.

		We can’t accept U.S. view of inevitable war.

		U.S. may look at G. re-armamt. on basis of inevitable war.

		We must approach, not with unreasong. optimism, but with

		some hope.

	Don’t believe Stalin wants war.  Our aim must be to get change in

		internal system behind Iron Curtain wh. will make for peace.

	Use G. re-armament as card to swop in return for a settlemt.



H.G.	Agree with that.

	We want CFM. to succeed.

	Can’t discuss G. alone.  Then what else?  Genl. disarmamt. (if not

		first):  Austria.  What else?

	Cd. F.O. run thro’ points of disagreemt. with R. &amp; select the least

		troublesome.  Try &amp; get somethg. small agreed first.

	Too much wool.



A.V.A.	Is para. 15 – tho’ prs. a bit starkly stated – not wholly justified by

		facts from 1945 onwards.

	R. has bn. consistent &amp; clear for years.  Gobbling them up one by

		one.  Sitn to-day is v. diff. fr. 1945.

	I want negotn.  But on realistic basis.



P.M.	Believe that over-estimates R. part in Ch. adventure.  Due rather to

		Ch. nationalism – wh. may not always be cats-paw of Moscow.



A.B.	Pact of non-aggression incldg. Yugoslavia.  Helpful to suggest that.



H.McN.	Who is trying to get a breakdown on agenda now?



K.Y.	Send telegram:

		i)	genl. views of Cabinet, as gloss on Annexes.

		ii)	we reject agenda confined to G.

		iii)	other items: for discn.  Cab. not to be commd until they 

			see Sov. reply.

		On tentative list in Annex B.  Cab. don’t want genl. 

			disarmament taken first:  too dangerous.

		Discuss other subjects with others &amp; report to Cab.

	Diff. to think of specific non-controversial items to add.



H.M.	G. re-armament.

	V. diff. to accept view tht. G. will remain disarmed indefinitely.

		As it stands, unfair to have w.G. unarmed while e.G. is armed.

	Czecho.  Healthiest Parly democracy in Europe.  Yet R. coup.

		Where wd. we stand if same happened to G.

	V doubtful about arguments now used v. re-armamt. of G.



H.D.	Content to leave G. re-armament on basis tht. it is played v. long.

	But if CFM. offers chance for a deal, we shd. be ready to trade it.





	7.	Korea.



P.M.	Suggd I might make announcemt. in H/C.



K.Y.	Might be helpful if we made it clear tht. our vote is not intended to

		exclude negotns with Peking.

	For domestic purposes – might have connected statemt.



H.G.	Cd we get more permanent publicity for Jebb’s speeches – e.g. in 

		Wh. Paper.



P.M. &amp; H.D.	Favoured that.



K.Y.	It wd. be v. long.



H.G.	Make Gladwyn’s 2 main speeches available in some form.



P.M.	Read out draft prepared by F.O.
