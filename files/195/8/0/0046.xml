C.M. 78(50).				29th November, 1950.



1.	Korea.



E.B.	Tels. show posn up to last night.

	Diffies increased (Indo-China) because Fr. Govt. have fallen.

		Schuman merely hoping no precipitate action will be taken.

	Ever since last F. Affairs debate, I have bn. anxious.  Am now 

		v. worried re a move in Berlin.  Have alerted intelligence 

		services.  These have bn. at fault in F/East.  Austria also a 

		danger spot.  Cab. shd. be aware of this risk in Europe.  Acheson

		has drawn attention to this.

	Later telegram from W’ton is more encouraging.

	Cab. were concerned tht. Govts contributg. to U.N. in Korea were

		being consulted on policy.  I obtd satisfy. assurances on this from

		U.S. Govt.

	Concerned re U.S. C.O.S. reaction to latest developmts.  Might carry

		us beyond U.N. policy.

	Was therefore in close touch with U.S. y’day.  Read latest telegram:

		fr. W’ton.  Tel. 2776 assurances re-affirmed.  U.S. will continue

		to consult with U.K. &amp; intend to handle situation thro’ U.N. &amp;

		not unilaterally.  Purposes:  resist aggression:  localise hostilities,

		wind up Korea quickly w’out commitment long-term of U.N.

		Forces.

	U.S. have taken line in Sec. Council tht. these organised Ch. armies =

		act of open aggression.  I agree.  But how do we fight it?

		If we get into M’Churia we’ll never get out.  If there has to be

		a fight better have it in Korea – l/c are easier, apart fr. politics.

		Believe U.S. share this view.  Fear pressure to bomb their l/c. –

		esp. as Ch. based enemy bombers are workg. over Korea.  But

		avoid doctrine of hot pursuit.

	Situation serious – but not out of hand.

	MacA’s communiqués were ill-advised:  but we can’t stop him.

		All we can ask is assurance of consultn on policy:  &amp; this we 

		have.  We can’t expect consultn betwn. all Govts on mil. tactics

		&amp; moves.



P.M.	MacA’s H.Q. has bn. over optimistic.  This check may make him

		over-emphasise strength of Ch. attack.  His strategy was wrong –

		advanced beyond neck and let S. Koreans hold vital centre.  Bad

		mistake.  Watch his identificns of Ch. Divns.

	V. talkative.  We must keep cool.

	Most fatal thing to get bogged down in K.  Important only as symbol 

		of U.N. resistce to aggression:  not important per se.

		Must get large nos. pinned down there.

	M.S. might have consulted us before Austin spoke.



E.B.	One ugly developmt. in U.S. – “dragging our feet”, Munich

		mentality etc.

	Must find means of challenging &amp; countering this.  But mustn’t be 

		rash over it.



T.W.	What happened over our views re stopping at neck.



E.B.	That view was put to us, but they were not in agreement.  And

		MacA.’s offensive cd. not in any event be stopped.



H.D.	Disregard of U.K. views is serious.





	2.	Soviet Proposal for 4-Power Meeting.



P.M.           	a)	Contacts with China in Sec. Council?  b) And relns with Russia?



E.B.            	b)	Read extract fr. speech.  Main line:  statement to H/C. when R.

		invitn recd.  No negative reply.  Will seek settlemt. by negotn

		wherever possible.  In consultn Fr. &amp; U.S. &amp; can now announce

		tht. 3 deputies are mtg. next week [or followg.] to discuss reply

		to R.



A.               |	Expand explann, dipl. exchanges etc., of why we haven’t bn. able to

                   |		arrange earlier mtg. of deputies.



A.B.	Bad feeling in Parly Party.  Much will depend on E.B.’s speech to-day.

		Warn E.B. of this.

	U.S. behaviour &amp; MacA.’s personality make Korea appear a U.S.,

		rather than U.N., affair.  MacA. is v. unpopular with public 

		opinion U.K.  The U.N. aspect of this is defeated by MacA’s

		personality.

	Presentn to-day.  Thght. we weren’t ready to meet C.F.M. on Prague

		Basis.  “Deputies considerg. draft reply” will be ill-received.  We

		shd. say “mtg. to prepare a more comprehensive agenda.”



H.M.	There is feeling in Party.       1. (contd)  Korea.



E.Sh.	Party anxiety flows fr. present sitn in Korea, not 4 Power mtg.

	We are drifting to a crisis.

	Serious because v. dangerous posn in Europe if we get committd 

		in F/E.  For apart fr. U.K. forces, no W. Europn strength.

	All v. well to blame MacA. – and at some points he is at fault –

		But on de-militarised zone plan, U.S. Govt. were v. unreceptive.

		Why?  The American C.O.S. were not prepared to interfere with

		MacA.

		How then can there be any consultn with other U.N. Govts.

		This is being handled as U.S. affair - &amp; U.S. Govt. allow MacA.

		to run things as he wishes.

	Implicns of Austin’s statemt. re aggression.  If we bomb beyond

		M’churian frontier R. aircraft will come in:  &amp; that = major war.

	If U.N. resoln re aggression is carried, we must back U.N. resistce of

		Ch. offensive.  If 200.000 Ch. there already, good soldiers &amp; well

		equipped, we shall have to put many more troops in.  Shan’t be

		able to decline.  Thus weaken posn in Europe &amp; M/East.

	On Korea, we decided to back U.N. assumg. 38th parallel.  But need to

		get N. Korean surrender.  Wd. be same re China.  MacA. will

		insist on bombing M’churia.  That means major war.



H.McN.	Resoln doesn’t mention “aggression” by Chinese.



E.Sh.	That will come.  Tentative suggn:  shd. we make it clear now tht. we

		shall resist. Ch. offensive in Korea:  but shall w’draw to a line:

		or preferably tht. we will not go beyond M’churian border on

		land or air.  Say it to U.S. – not publicly.

	No hostile intentions v. Chinese.  Make that clear.

	U.S. have led us astray over this because not prepared to keep MacA.

		in control.

	No other country is helping us.

	If our casualties increase, we shd. have diff. case to answer.

	Told C.O.S. months ago we might have to fight alone.  They thght.

		me silly.  Not sure now I wasn’t right.



E.B.	This doesn’t go beyond what Acheson has said in latest telegram.



J.G.	We shall be asked to-day wtr. we have a voice in MacA.’s counsels

		As we have troops.  Is there a B. repve strong enough to hold

		his own with MacA.?



E.Sh.	No.



P.M.	How cd. we have influence over C-in-C. – on basis of our brigade.

	All we have to do is to get assurances re policy fr. U.S. Govt.



H.D.	We shd. however emphasise our views v. sharply to U.S.



E.B.	I warned you – in a lr. from London Clinic.



H.G.	Can’t put blame on U.S.  We agreed we must go beyond 38th in

		spite of warning fr. India.  We have known for weeks we were

		takg. this risk.  Thght. Ch. were bluffing – now know they

		weren’t.

	How cd. we fail to support U.N. resoln re Ch. aggression?

		In last resort, we shd. have to follow U.S. lead.

		If we w’drew support for U.S. strategy in Korea, they wd. be

		the quicker to w’draw their assistce in Europe – w’out which

		we shdn’t have a chance v. R.

	Worried (not at mil. sitn for now proposed to w’draw to waist) but at

		long-term solution.  How do we end this?

		Ch. cd. hold us indefinitely.  Negotn will be inevitable at some

		stage.  Isn’t it time to have heart-to-heart with Acheson on

		long-term problem.  Are U.S. never to recognise Ch. Govt. –

		is there to be no settlement with them ever?

A.B.	I see it rather as part of R. problem.

	If Ch. movemt. in K. was prompted by R., it will be followed by

		a move in Europe.

	I don’t believe that.  Not a part of wider R. strategy.  I think Ch. are

		merely frightened at MacA.’s intentions.

	If we go back to waist, the war will (or may) die away.

	U.S. Govt. are as ham handed as MacA.  Para 4 of 3195 (we were

		never consulted) if resoln carried, MacA. wd. have his right to

		bomb M’churia.

	We must get tough with U.S.  Shall be told tht. we haven’t influence

		with U.S. correspondg. to our place in U.N.  I therefore propose

                      |		tht. on R. offer to talk, E.B. shd. take a bolder line &amp; say we are

                    x|		ready to go in on comprehensive agenda.  We must snatch 

                      |		diplomatic initiative from R.



E.B.	That is precisely what I am trying to do.



A.	Delay decn on U.N. resoln condemng. Ch. aggression.

	Get tough with the U.S.

	Say we can’t be led by nose by MacA.



E.B.	Are you prepared to break with U.S.?  And forfeit their support

		in Europe?



C.E.	We aren’t ready for war in Europe, qua C. Def.  Yet Fr. (Indo-Ch.) 

		U.S. (Korea) &amp; U.K. (Malaya) commd heavily, at R. instance,

		yet w’out R. involved

	Can we tell Party our line of limitg. our commitments in Korea?  That

		we have consistently tried to avoid being committed.



A.B.	Party know that’s our view.  What they doubt is wtr. we can influence

		U.S. sufficiently to agree with our view.  Also, they want an 

		effective response to R. invitn to a mtg.



J.G.	Also, distrust of MacA.



E.B.	What can I do about that?  U.N. voted him Commander.

		Am I to ask them to dismiss him?  Will Cab. ask me to do that.



P.M.	After his outstanding success in fighting back fr. his bridgehead.



J.G.	Trouble is:  he’s not merely a soldier.  If there is crisis, U.S. shd.

		know tht. U.K. opinion wdn’t be solid if U.N. Forces 

		commanded by a politician &amp; a re-actionary one.



E.Sh.	U.S. wdn’t re-call MacA. at U.K. request.



H.McN.	Line with Party must be tht. R.’s main objective is to divide U.S.

		&amp; U.K.  We can’t differ from them publicly.

	Ques. really is:  shall we tell U.S. at once (privately) tht. they must

		not amend U.N. resoln.  Stand on existg. 6-Power resoln.
