C.M. 76 (50)				                                                         20th November, 1950



1.	     East Africa.



J.G.	Unrest in multi-racial communities. Due to

a.	S. African Govt,

b.	assocn with them of white settlers

c.	constitl evolution in W. Africa.

	Various suggns for handling it on E. African basis.  That wdn’t do unless Govt. had plan.

	Prefer therefore to proceed by territories separately.  Have taken diffr. steps in diff. colonies.

	Hence proposed statement.

	Para. 2 (iv) of crucial importance.  Can’t have S. Rhodesia as model.

		We must retain ultimate control until a community is wholly fit for self-government.



P.M.	Countries in group are v. different.  e.g. Kenya &amp; Uganda.  Is it right, even in statement, to deal with all as tho’ one.

                  x|	Wrong to separate one element of under-developed area problem.

	Wrong to include “appeal” (para. 2. (v)) in a statement of principles.

		Doubt if para. 2(v) shd. be included.



J.G.	Para. 2(i) meets x|.



E.Sh.	Beginning of 2 (iii).  “We have assisted in … development &amp; propose to do so.”  Present text treats them too much as children.  Prefer to stress economic than paternal note.



A.B.	Aim?  To pacify white or native elements?  Parts of this will excite native feeling vice pacifying it.  Para. 2(iii) – omit [].

		In 2 (iv) is [] necessary?



J.G.	Yes:  I think it is.



A.B.	But provocation to native elements.

		Also “developing” vice “allowing” in 2 (iv).



G.W.	Doubt expediency of announcg. now statement of principles containg. nothg. new.

	Shdn’t we first look at policy twds. Africa as a whole.  S. Rhodesia &amp; risk of driving her into S. African arms.

	In inter-racial society “African” shd. cover all:  shd. find another name for nations.  



J.G.	What other term? – which wdn’t be even more difficult.



J.	Is it necessary to make any statement.



A.	Sympathise with C.O. – subject to changes of working, &amp; omission of 2 (iv).  Healthy fr. pt. of view of Europ. settlers – and corrective to influences occasioned by over-rapid developmt. in W. Africa.



E.B.	Events are moving fast.  Africa may become cock-pit in U.N.

		Decision re Indians may have repercussions.

	Cd. we adjourn this for a week &amp; see it in larger African setting.



J.G.	Committed to make a statement at some time.  But cd. be p’poned for a little while.



P.M.	Trying to deal with no. of places in one statement may trip you up.

		Kenya was launched as white man’s settlement.  Uganda never was.

		Evades ques. what sort of constitnl advance is suited to their condns – implies Parly system is right for all.



J.G.	Kenya will press for constitution like that of S. Rhodesia.

	We shall have to insist on multi-racial solutions.  Important to make that clear soon.



G.W.	Need for review of our policy.  Reactions on other parts of Africa, including other Colonial Powers.  ? Cabinet Committee.



			Agreed: Comm. Affairs Cttee to consider.





		2.	Coal						[Enter N.B.



N.B.	N.C.B. want statement made to-day.  They can’t begin to charter ships until it’s made.



H.G.	Nothg. in draft re productions.  Will be supplementaries on that.  Better to include para. in original draft.



		Approved draft of statement, subject to amendments suggested.

			Statement to be made to-day.  N.C.B. &amp; N.U.M. to receive       advance copies.

						             [Exit N.B.



		3.	Egypt.



E.B.	Submitted draft of answer to various P.Q.’s.

	Seeing Ambassador to-day.  Will see Foreign Minister en route from U.N.

	Eg. Govt. wd. like to be included in N.A.T.O.  Can’t do that.  May be advantage in discussing length of duration of Treaty:  &amp; get some other States into it collectively, getting away from bi-lateral Anglo-Eg. pact.  Doubt also if solution will be found on basis of defence alone – prs. finance, trade etc., cd. be roped in:  for M/East as a whole.  Arab/Jew rift has h’to prevented this.

	Development of Uganda &amp; Lake Tana will alter aspect of Egypt &amp; Sudan.

	Problem:  to keep people steady pending these developmts.



E.Sh.	Can’t get on with my M/E. plans until Treaty problem is solved.

		V. urgent fr. my angle.



H.G.	Foreign Minister comg. next week to discuss sterling balances.  Have we still to be v. tender because f. policy &amp; defence?



E.B.	I suggest I meet with H.G. &amp; E.Sh. to discuss this – in light of this weeks’ discn in U.N. re Libya.  If that went well, our posn wd. be easier.



		 	Draft answer approved.



	Sudan.  If passed, shall put emphasis on developmt. to self-Govt. rather than negative stand on condominium.





		4.	Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.



P.M.	All P.M.’s have accepted save Malan.

	Will announce on Wed. next.  Both Houses.



					       [Enter Att. Genl.

		5.	Korea.



   E.B.	70.000 Chinese, acc. to latest element.  And bad weather.

	U.N. resolution – settg. out our objectives.  To allay worst Chinese fears.

	Sounded U.S. on demilitarised area s. of M’churian frontier.

	Tried for series of proposals.

	Adminn of area.  Thought for U.N. alone – w’out Chinese.

	Fr. supported:  U.S. didn’t discourage:  India &amp; Canada encouraging.

	Was already resoln before Council.  Shd. that be w’drawn?

		Feared it wd. re-open everything.  So going on with existg. resoln (?)

	Chinese delegn due to arrive.

	Thgt. it wise m’while to make U.K. attitude plain to China directly.

		Localise war:  just settlement, early:  united Korea.

		Wanted at least to have tried.  Instructed Hutchinson accordingly.  Informed Fr., U.S. &amp; Doms.  Most welcome our demarche – tho’ we haven’t yet had reply fr. India.  Don’t think U.S. will oppose.

	Aim of policy:  to prevent hostilities going over into M’Churia. &amp; thus outbreak of serious war.



 

		6.	Formosa.



	      Approved.





		7.	Overseas Operations Bill.

				                                                             [Enter B. &amp; Wheatley

H.M.	As in memo.



E.Sh.	Does Bill cover deploymt. in prepn for opns,



B.	Omit provision re requisitioning of ships.                      Agreed.

                      a) inappropriate to this Bill.

    b) throws doubt on other powers.



Att. G.	Cl. 9 (3) meets E.Sh. point.



J.	Publicity clause:  cd. we omit “with intent”?



Att. G.	That wd. be more extreme than D. Reg.



Wh.	2nd alternative was likely to meet civil liberties groups.

	If “interest” remains, accused can still plead tht. he was drawg. public attentn to truth with intent to get their opinion to change.

		First formula won’t therefore evade diffy stated in memo.



Att.G	But he wd. have more diffy. than if truth were sufft defence.



G.W.	Expression of opinion shd. not be impeded.  I prefer 2nd alternative.

		Comm. pamphlet was not, in my view, improper publicy.

		Violently expressed, but not improper expn of view.



A.B.	Danger in suppressing free expression of opinion.



P.M.	Doubtful if clause will be any use.



Att.G.	Thurtle’s P.Q. for to-day.  Either treason or nothing.  And I can’t say it’s nothing.



Wh.	2nd alternative wd. be more acceptable to Parliament.



P.M.	What about Ll.G. in Boer war?  Aren’t we getting rather too sensitive?

	We shall be exposed to attack in Parlt. by Liberal traditions – on ground tht. we are inconsistent with our own past.



H.M.	W’out this clause, not worth going on with Bill at all.

	Cab. asked for this Bill.  We didn’t bring it up.

P.M.	I wanted Bill for sabotage.



Att.G.	Was never necessary for sabotage.

	Korean situation has deteriorated &amp; propaganda about it has increased.



C.E.	We shd. have to consult Opposition before going on – as well as T.U.C.

	Not worth going on, unless cl. 2 is out of court.



P.M.	Att. Genl’s diffy. wd. be greater if new legn were passed.



			Agreed:  P’pone introduction of the Bill.



H.G.	Law isn’t satisfactory.  Shd. we not review it?			     [Exit B.

				                    

E.B.	Shd. we not consider legal effects or powers to ques. effect to U.N. decns.



			Agreed:  Att.G. cd. say law of treason is under considn.





8.	  Mr. MacManaway.



			Memo. approved.





9.	  Rent Restrictions.



P.M.	Took note.

	We shd. stall, merely, in discns on Leasehold.





10.	  Pensions for Judge’s Widows.



Att.G.	Sc. Judges object to this – as worsening posn of future appointees.



J.	Actuarially, this wd. benefit them.

	Let us say tht., if they really want to be taken out of Bill, they can.  	Scots &amp; Irish.



Wh.	Shd. their attitude be allowed to prejudice posn of future Judges.



P.M.	Have you consulted Scottish Bar?



Wh.	No.



H.M.	Cd. individuals have right of option.



Wh.	Promise to consider in Cttee stage: &amp; take soundings m’while.



Att.G	Is it certain tht. County Court Judges are in favour?



J.	As far as it goes.  Tho’ they want more salary.
