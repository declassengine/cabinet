C.M. 62(50)							         28th September 1950



		1.	Gas Strike.	[Enter Att.G., E. Davies. H.G., M.W., N-Baker.



C.E.	Mtg. of Em. Cttee (Ministerial) y’day.

	G.A.I. and Gould are seeing Tanner (AEU – representg. ⅔ of strikers). Shop stewards decline call mtg. of men, despite request of Confedn: Tanner may be willing to go straight to men.  Links betwn. Confedn and men are largely Communists.



	Supervisory staff doing some m’tenance work w’out provokg. producer men.

	Bd. hope to do more of this.  Don’t recommend use of troops – they cdn’t suffice if strike spreads.

	Prosns under Act of 1875.  N. Thames Gas Bd. had advised v. prosn of 28 leaders.  But they have reviewed their attitude since.  My Cttee 

                  x/	thought tht. if Att.G. had enough evce and men hadn’t returned by Frid. no pol. or industrial reasons v. procdgs.



G.A.I.	Seen Secy. of Genl. and Mun. Workers – trying to keep his men steady and in work.

	Deakin similarly using influence quietly.



N.B.	Y’day, threat to industry and employmt.

	Domestic: 15% no gas: 30% only some.  Many people stopped using gas y’day and holders now full and pressure has risen on that a/c.

	Fewer plants in opn: one broke down y’day.

	Need: mass mtgs. of workers thro’ Tanner.  Because Union leaders have not bn. helpful.

	Prosn some day we must prosecute someone.  This is as good a case as we are likely to get.



Att.G.	In view of posn M/L.’s public statement increasingly diff. to refrain fr. operatg. crim. law – esp. Act of 1875.

	Over a yr. ago, on electricity, Cab. said Bds. shd. proceed for breach of contract.  I believe they shd. at outset.  If men go back, Bds. cd settle

                  y/	as we cdn’t with crim. procdgs.  And failure to pay fine isn’t followed by impr. but only by distraint.



H.G.	Effects on industry are now beginning to be serious.



A.B.	Put y/ into minds of men not on strike.  Bds. shd. issue pamphlets after consultn with L.O.’s on language.



N.B.	Willing to follow that up.  Will do so.



E.Sh.	T.U.’s shd. be consulted in advance if this is to be done.



		Agreed as at x/ and y/.

							         [Exit N.B.

		2.	E. African Ground Nuts: Kangwa.



M.W.	If we plant as before, gt. loss.  If we stop all operns blow to prestige. Cattle = reasonable middle course.  Ample safeguards on markets and water.



P.M.	Any redn of overheads in consequence?



M.W.	That will come in genl. review of whole scheme in Nov.



H.G.	Support M/F. Limiting commitments. No new capital expre.



J.G.	I support it too.  Cattle necessary to hold cleared land.



A.V.A.	This rpt. will be joy for Opposn – not only because past history but because interim nature of rpt.  Sunflower business will be exploited. Hope we shall get better infn on final report.

	Cattle even are to be confined to narrow area.  Tho’ this is the one thing proved possible by experiment.  Tho’ we still don’t know the market for them – that is still subject to research.



H.McN.	V. uninformative report – save re failures.

	Why stores.  Why not breeding cattle.  Poor return on 2 yrs. feeding.

	Why only a little maize?  Looks easiest crop – indigenous.



M.W.	Maize will grow only in valley – using all available ground of that kind.

	Cattle.  Breeding wd. involve heavy capital expenditure.

	Outlets – in Africa, type of meat not popular elsewhere.  Bd. satisfied tht. quantities this year cd. be sold w’out diffy.



J.G.	Also hides can be sold to U.K. – usefully.



M.W.	W. Party cdn’t begin opns until results of this years’ working were known.



H.M.	If rept. publd there will be a row – sooner the better.

	Simultaneous statement by Corpn or M/F. – “harmed lesson and changes made”.



M.W.	Bd. are issuing rpt.  Chairman is mtg. Press.



A.B.	Other undertakgs. overseas have bn. more successful.  Cdn’t we marry them in announcemt.?



J.G.	Diff. for Coates to pray in aid C. Dev. Corpn schemes.  Their rept. was publd recently and had a good Press.



M.W.	No new repts. on other projects available.  Dragging out old ones wd. be seen through.

G.W.	A good Ministerial speech is only way of mtg. A.B.’s point.



P.M.	Hope M.W. and J.G. will both take opportunity of makg. genl. statements to put this into perspective.

			Also H.G. re S.E.A.



							   [Enter Henderson

		3.	Surrender of War Criminals.



H.	 Made clear at time tht. this was to be short term policy.

	5 yrs. have past: no d.o. every made for this purpose.

	Time to w’draw our undertakg.

	The 19 Yug. traitors - Yug. Govt. not likely to shout v. much.

	Germany:  no traitors surrendered for 1½ yrs.

	                 War criminals    “       only on prima facie evce of murder.

	But more likely to need this in G. than in U.K.



C.E.	I provoked this.  Fully support it.

	Embarrassed by existence of undertakg. E.g. Dr. Dering, wanted by Poles.

		                  Agree.				[Exit H.





		4.	Relations with S. Africa.



G.W.		a)  Genl. – most diff. problem in C. Relns.

		Native policy – causes diffy. in Colonies and in Labour Party.

		On other hand, genl. economic relns are satisfy.  Defence talks are 			encouraging.  Present Govt. has gone further twds. committg. 			themselves to give mil. support in war than any S.A. Govt. has ever 

		done.

	We must keep them in Comm.  Oppose them on H. Commn Territories – can’t hold those v. hostile S.A. Govt.  Avoid expressg. sympathy with native policy – but refrain also fr. condemning it.  Can, A. and N.Z. have same attitude as U.K. on this.



		b)  U.N. Problems.	i) Indians in S. Africa.

					ii) S.W. Africa.



	On ii) main diffy: some countries will try to dodge acceptg. full opinion.  They will say there shd be rpts. and petns but they shd. go to Trusteeship Council.  We must try to get full report: if we can’t keep our hands free.  Support least violent resoln acceptg. full report.



		c)  Michael Scott.  U.S. refusg. visa because of Comm. affiliations. 		      Indians will move resoln invitg. him to attend.  S. Afr. will walk 		      out in that event before discn begins.  We are trying to persuade 		      U.S. to grant visa now – as they have indicated they will if Ind. 		      resoln is passed by Cttee.  What shall we do if resoln is put?  I 			      favour voting against – wrong to invite individuals and India won’t 		  mind such a vote.  S. Afr. wd. hate our voting opposite way.  We shd. 		oppose on principle any resoln invitg. him to speak to Cttee.



P.M.	Stand on basis of no individuals to partake in mtgs. of States.



E.D.	We stand (F.O.) by that principle.  But in favour of abstaining for	

	i) we are changing our line on Col. matters.  Don’t want to be courting       unpopularity at outset.

	ii) pol. reactions in U.K.  Much feeling in his favour.



J.G.	Must stand firm v. hearing of individuals – as a principle.

	But C.O. diffies.  If we oppose Scott we seem to be siding with S. Africa.

	On genl. issue: see defence and econ. advantages of keeping S. Afr in Comm: but we may have to choose betwn. S. Africa and our Colonies – in Africa.  Penetratn of Afrikaners into N. Rhodesia.

	Abstention may be best course.

	Essential tht. we shd. accept Intern. Ct’s decision fully.  No dubiety over that – or over Col. posn will be prejudiced.



Att.G.	On M. Scott.  V. dangerous precedent if he is admitted.  We opposed it last year, on principle.  Can’t admit principle tht. individuals can appeal to Assembly over head of their Govt.



H.McN.	Also quite imposs. administratively to admit individuals.

	We shd. be honest and oppose it – as wrong in principle and unworkable in practice.

	Visa – not our business: we shd. express no view.

	Speak and vote against admission of M. Scott.



P.M.	Abstention wd. be weak.  On the point of principle, we must make our posn clear.



A.V.A.	Endorsed that view.			Agreed.



A.B.	Genl. issue is v. diff.  Awkward not to express any opinion on S. Afr. policy.  Whole literature of protest.

	We may have to decide tht. we lose more than we gain by supportg. S. Africa.

	Originally I disagreed with our line re S. Africa.  And in event we were in humiliatg. minority in U.N.

	Must therefore support opinion of Intern. Court.

	On admission of individual, need we incur such unpopularity.



E.D.	First resoln will merely invite him to be in N. York.



G.W.	But only purpose of that is to follow with 2nd resoln allowg. him to speak.



E.Sh.	This genl. problem is not easy.

	Gt. defence importce of S. Africa.  They have now come across with offer of armoured divn in M/E.  No such offer from India.

	Believe they are influenced by desire to assume gter responsibilities and powers over Africa.



	Thus: accept decision of Court.



		(re-affirm principle of not hearing individuals in U.N.

		(v. weak to be constantly abstaining.



P.M.	Colour ques. isn’t all that easy. S. Afr. may be extreme.  But there’s also a problem of our own in Malaya.  And there’s a White Australia policy.  Also (mentioned earlier) U.S.A.



H.M.}	Stressed need to keep S. Africa in Commonwealth.

E.Sh.}



P.M.	Problem is to influence less extreme opinion in S. Africa.  If we support opp. extreme (eg. Scott) we may alienate moderates.



		P.M.  (i)   Uphold decision of Court – vote for it.

	Agreed.	     Unambiguously: tho’ not necessarily takg.

			     initiative.  Decision as a whole.



		         (ii)   M. Scott.  Say, whatever the merits, we uphold

			     principle tht. individuals can’t be heard in appeal

			     r. municipal law of States.  Don’t mind his coming

			     to N. York.



		5.	Korea.



P.M.	Indian Amb. in Pekin thinks China will re-act v. violently v. any crossing of 38th P.



E.D.	Diff. to know wthr. Ch. fears are real or wthr. it’s bluff.

	Also Indian Amb. may be a panicker.

	Stand to our resoln try to re-assure China in presentg. it.  Might help if U.S. wd. agree tht. Ch. be invited to N. Yk. for Formosa or some other ques. 

	Wd. like to put that suggn to E.B.  



P.M.  	Endorsed that.



G.W.	Also: can any more re-assurance be given re bombing across Ch. frontier.
