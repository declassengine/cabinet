C.M. 44(50)							                  10th  July 1950



		1.	Korea.					[Enter W.W., M.W.



		Strategic Exports to China.



P.M.	Read minute from E.B.

	We were committed to U.S. subject to reservn which has now bn. met.

		overt action required.  No reason therefore to suppose offence will be 

	given to China.  U.K. action not dissimilar from that recommended for H. Kong and Singapore.



R.S.C.	We had no scruples about U.K. – only about H. Kong and Singapore.



H.W.	Thought we had agreed to do it qua U.K.



P.M.  	Minutes of earlier Cabinet didn’t ques. effect to our wishes which were in accordance with E.B.’s views.





		2.	Parliament.



H.M.	Re-arrangement of business to facilitate personal statement by Strachey.



	Tuesday: (via Education) Debate on Strachey’s statement, in supply: followed by debate on War Damage Claims – prob. on Adjournment.



R.S.C.	Some old cases are being admitted now, when merits are good, even tho’ appln is out of tune.  What Mrs. Middleton is asking is that all claims be admitted automatically which were notified to l.a.’s

	This we couldn’t agree to.



A.B.	Cd. you not admit that as ground for acceptg. late application.



R.S.C.	We do, where applicant was told by l.a. official tht. he needn’t apply to W.D. Commn.



C.E.	This is alleged but can’t be proved in some cases.



A.B.	Can’t give way to Tories what we refused to our own supporters in last Parliament.  Defend our adminn (as now): but admit no new principle.



H.M.	Doubt if Tories will have this on Adjournment.  They will prob. want a Motion.



		Agreed : 	H.M. and R.S.C. to consider wthr. Labour supporter 				shd. be asked to put down a Motion.



	

		3.	Renewal of Emergency Powers.



H.M.		Not yet settled wthr. we have Econ. Power Bill.  But clear now we 			cdn’t assume it wd. pass before 10/12 even if Cab. decided to go on 		with it.

		Ques. arises when we shd. renew existg. Acts.

		Adminve diffy. that Orders can’t be expd as continuing beyond 10/12.

		M/F. diffy.

		Recommend we do this in week of this Session in Oct.



P.M.		Cd. you announce in advance intentn to renew.



H.M.		Just before summer Recess.  In last Statement on Business.



T.W.		Important thing is tht. Dpts. shd. know.



J.		H/L. may decline to pass the Address. 



A. 		Must make a good case.



R.S.C.		May be wise to announce at same time our intention to introduce 			permanent legn.



H.D.		Tho’ latter is what Tories do oppose – not tempy extensn by renewal.



A.B.		Early prodn of Bill with long preamble giving purposes.



H.M.		I advocated that: but Cab. didn’t then like it.



							[Exit W.W.

		4.	Meat Strike.			[Enter B. and Att.Genl.



G.A.I.		Deakin is satisf. with his men’s resistance to strikers’ demand for 			extension of strike.  Some stoppages, but only at places related to 			Smithfield.  In genl., 75% are workg.  No stoppages at Shell.

		Only 59 men are out, in genl. haulage.

		1.475 men out fr. road haulage Executive – addl to original but nearly 		all in places related to S’field.

		Covent Gdn. is however affected.  About 250 vehicles will stop 			tomorrow.

		Tugboatmen.  M/L. suggd Cttee of Investign.  Men have accepted this 		and men on light boats have returned to work.  But now the heavy 			boatmen have come out, on 3 days’ token strike over dismissal of one 		man.

		Mtg. this pm. to get petrol-tanker drivers out. Union resistg.



C.E.		Confirm G.A.I.’s informn.

		Most serious threat = petrol-tankers.  That, if effective, wd. bring all 		transport to a stop for lack of fuel.  No dispute at all in that group.



		No evce of any political motive in this strike: tho’ we have tried hard 		to find some.  Sp. Branch rpt. to D.P.P. – names a man (Tribe) whom 		Mellish believes to be at bottom of it all.  Paid organiser for T.G.W. 		Union in S’field.



		Cab. decided Thurs. tht. troops might go in to docks today.

		Emerge. Cttee decided it wd. be unwise – they cd. go on clearg. 			S’field.  We thought they shd. go in on Tuesd.  Now recd memo. fr. 		J.A. who is v. use of troops in docks.  And we don’t want docks out if 		strike is to spread to road haulage generally, esp. petrol.  M/F. can 			devise means of feeding Ldn. this wk. w’out using troops in docks.



M.W.		Four ways of doing it -  

				   a)	full corn-beef ration, as in 1st week.

				   b)	take cow-beef from non-dock cold stores

					(usually used in sausages).

				   c)	bring meat to Ldn. fr. provincial cold

					stores, by mil. labour.

				   d)	run meat to rail sidings.



		But c) and d) wd. spread the strike.

		I recommend a).  



P.M. 		I support a).



G.A.I.		Deakin will see strikers, if they ask to see him, and tell them to go back 		to work w’out condns.

		He believes he can prevent any further extension. 



A.B.  		And if he does, the original strikers will go back.



C.E.		Don’t share this optimism.  Petrol men may come out.  Thus most 			drastic action will be necessary.



B.		Is Emerg. Cttee mtg. today?  This is a critical moment.

		If strike widens, we must press Union and employers to handle the 			situation themselves w’in industry.  Mistake not to have done this 			earlier.  We ought to be takg. steps to get loyal men mobilised behind 		their Union leaders.



M.W.		There is gross intimidn in markets.  Many men say they wd. go back on 		secret ballot.  Wd. Deakin hold such a ballot?



G.A.I.		In dock strike it was done and pickets intimidated the ballot.



Att.G.		Saw D.P.P. this am.  Raised diffies re procdgs., includg. M/L. view that 		stoppage in other parts of road haulage industry is not “indl dispute”.

		No evce v. anyone of inciting others to strike.  Cd. prosecute a few men 		for strikg.  Have told D.P.P. tht. member of Strike Cttee shd. be asked 		by Police wthr. they are members.

H.M.          x/	Cd. P.M. + G.A.I. and C.E. see Deakin  M/Transport (Barnes)

		Or, better, cd. E.B. see him?



G.A.I.		E.B. has seen him – he’s concerned only to save Deakin’s face.

		

		Agreed at x/ :  M/L. to arrange.

		Course a) regarding Ldn’s meat – approved.



J.G.		We shd. mobilise our loyal supporters in Labour Party and T.U.’s to 		fight Communists at this juncture.  Ask Deakin what he will do.



								[Exit B., Att.Genl., M.W.

		5.	Korea.						[Enter K.Y.



P.M.		a)  We told Kelly to go to Soviet F.O. and ask them to use their 			      influence.

		      Subsequently Gromyko asked him to call and implied they might     		      be willing to try jointly.  Diff. to judge if it’s genuine.  We have 			told U.S.

		      Taken line we shdn’t fail to try any chance to get this broken off by 		      Security Council.



		We must base it on Sec. Council resoln tht. N. Koreans must w’draw.

		Must keep this dark pro tem.

		We are taking our own line, tho’ keeping U.S. informed.



		b)  U.S. Bombers in U.K.  U.S. want to re-inforce these (nos. have run 

	      	down) and some fighters want to do it now because F/E. sitn may make 		it diff. to do it later.  C.O.S. recommend.  Politically, however, 			awkward if it can’t be presented as a routine move.  Might be thought 		by R. otherwise as a threat.



K.Y.		E.B. endorses that view. Only acceleration of nos. planned.  Shd,. be 		repd w’in framework of Atl. Pact arrangemts – we aren’t allowg. F/E to 			interfere with that.



R.S.C.		Least said, better.  Don’t say even tht. acceleratn is related to Korea.

		Wd. be misunderstood.



		Agreed :	accept plan; play down publicity; don’t explain

				by refce to Korea; let U.K. control any publicity.



							                        [Exit K.Y.



	



		6.	Nationalisation of Water Supplies.		[Enter T. Fraser.



A.B.		Have seriously considered Joint Board alternatives to natn.  But can’t 		recommend it.  Wd. put heavy financial burden on urban users in such 		areas as Norfolk or Suffolk.  Also, on areas – sources wd. often have to 		be far outside the area, unless you made them wide enough to link 			B’ham and N. Wales etc.  To satisfy the pride of such towns as these, 		v. wide areas wd. be requd. 



P.M.		Why assume a Joint Bd. must have control over areas where its 			gathering grounds are?



A.B.		Because I want all areas on pipeline to be able to tap it.



P.M.		Why?  Suppose immense consumer like B’ham brings its water thro’ 		no. of areas whose supply needs can be met locally, it isn’t essential 		tht. these shd. draw on pipeline.



A.B.		Can’t ignore functional interests in identifying areas of Boards.

		Driven therefore into commendg. a scheme of natn.   Plus l.a. advisory 		function, on wh. I wd. be ready to consult l.a. associations.

		In H/C. we shall have trouble with p.u.’s.  Necessary politically, to 			split them and l.a.’s.

		Compensation – on basis of value of assets or on populn basis.

		I favour the second – in order to embroil l.a.’s with one another.



T.F.		Situation in Scotland is different.  There natn wd. be most unpopular. 		All supply is by l.a.’s.  Many regional schemes.

		Our big areas don’t run pipes thro’ thirsty areas – they give them drink 		of their charity.  Cost of rural supplies wd. loom v. large in total bill for 		water in Scotland. – diff. relative propn of urban and rural popns.  Water 		rate in Edinb. and Glasgow wd. rise from 9d. or 10d. to 2/6d.  Some 		rural interests wd. therefore not be so bitterly opposed to natn as the 		urban areas.  For Labour this wd. be electorally disastrous in Scotland.

		We want therefore nothg. more than extended powers of 				amalgamations.

		If we must go further because of E. and W., we wd. go as far as Joint 		Bds.



P.M.		V. doubtful v. expediency of makg. another cut at l.a. powers.

		M/H. makes a good case – too good a case.  Litigiousness of l.a.’s is 		not confined to water ques.  They can be made to collaborate.

		It is the Labour Councils who will suffer most – eg. Sheffield.

		Wd. prefer a more gradual approach.

		Much agitn but trouble is mainly due to inactivity in past of R.D.C.’s.

		We shall kill l.a.’s if we go further in this direction.

		Discussion to be resumed at a special mtg. of Cabinet.
