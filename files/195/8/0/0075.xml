 C.M. 21(51).				19th March, 1951.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  W.W.



	a)	Mr Speaker:  and Tory tactics in H/Commons.

C.E.	Speaker cannot preside until after Easter because illness.

		Announcement to-day.  W.S.C. informed.  Expns of regret

		to be made in H/C.

	Due in part to Tory tactics.  Intend on first Prayer to-night, to move

		that debate be adjourned:  and deploy the arguments against 

		these tactics.  At any hour after 10 p.m. Govt. can put 

		adjournment as Ques. w’out Debate.  Then the Prayers wd. not

		be taken.

	Tuesday’s business.  1st Order is out of order qua sub judice.

		Att.G. is prosecuting.  Tories want Egypt, in lieu, - on 

		adjournment:  may be a division at 7 p.m.



H.M.	We mustn’t appear to be limiting right to pray v. delegated legisln –

		e.g. by p’poning opportunities until time for praying is past.



W.W.	We are ready to stay late one night a week for this purpose.



C.E.	Govt. must force a crisis on this.  Members won’t go on staying up 

		all night.



A.B.	Worth waiting until after Recess?



H.D.	No:  Party morale has bn. low, is rising &amp; shd. be confirmed.



P.M.	Also challenge Boothby &amp; W.S.C. now.



E.Sh.	Modern rest-rooms for Labour M.P.’s in all-night sittings?



C.E.	I will go into this.





C.E.	b)	Business for 1st wk. after Recess.  I’m not ready.  May I settle

		with Ch. Whip &amp; P.M.?             Agreed.



H.W.	I’m thinking of going slow on Price Orders.  Manufrs. will then bring

		pressure on Tories to stop these tactics.  Cabinet approved (!).



A.B.	This counter attack of C.E.’s is not v. Tories but v. H/C. procedure.



P.M.	Closures, Kangeroo, guillotines etc., were called into existence to limit

		abuses.



C.E.	I shall instance these as precedents &amp; say we must find some way of

		modifying procedure to prevent this new kind of abuse.  I favour

		one night a week for Prayers.

A.B.	Wd that be wise – in these days of heavy delegated legn?



C.E.	Spker. allows only 1¼ hrs. for a Prayer:  &amp; will accept closure after

		that.



H.M.	Wait at least 24 hrs.  Think of promises we have given re freedom to 

		pray v. our gt. increase in delegated legn.  V. serious to limit

		those rights unduly.

	At this moment Tories have put themselves wrong with public 

		opinion.  Don’t lose that advantage.

	Limit yourself to-night to general argument &amp; threaten action

		(ousting a Prayer) as from to-morrow.



C.E.	Govt. supporters wdn’t follow us on that.  They wdn’t let me w’draw

		adjournment motion after the general debate.



J.G.	Don’t tie Leader of House.  Leave him with discretion to handle it in

		light of temper of House to-night.



A.B.	Beware of come-back tht. real trouble is Govt. majority is only 6:

		&amp; Govt. are trying to cure that by altering procedure of H/C.

	Leave final decision to Leader of House.



P.M.	I’m not afraid of argument being turned against us.



C.E.	I am content to leave it tht. I will adjust my tactics to-night in light

		of response from Front Opposn Bench.



W.W.	I support that.



A.	I support C.E. as against H.M.	

		  

	c)	Reserve Forces Bill.

A.	H/L. is mtg. to-day – in hope of agreed amendmt.



A.V.A.	Swinton offered compromise – provn for O-in-C. to deal with this

		point re T.A. if need found for it.  On promise to consider, he

		w’drew his 2 amendmts.

	M/D. willing to accept this compromise subject to small adjustment.



E.Sh.	Tories in H/L. are asking now for delegated legn.





	2.	Farm Price Review.	[Exit  W.W., C.E.

				[Enter  M.W.



A.	Folly to quarrel with farmers over issue of wool prices.



H.G.	Diff to decide.  Issue is not wool:  it’s another £5 m. on food.  Issue

		is primarily political.  On merits M/F. is probably right.  But

		this is no moment to take on addl row with farmers.  Must 

		make agric. interests in H/C. feel tht. we have made a generous

		settlement.



A.B.	Haven’t had time to work out effects on c/living index.  If there is a

		rise on that, another round of wage increases will be inevitable.

	Is it politically bad to have a row with farmers?  In this industrialised

		community.  Presented as a matter of holding down prices, it

		wd. be popular.

	Too high a reward doesn’t bring in more food.  They are getting too

		much already for their effort.



A.V.A.	Dangerous to break – with current Parly majority.

	And what wd. you break on?  If you m’tain control, you must take

		a/c (in prices) of rising costs.



P.M.	Farmers always get more than we calculate they will.  Any error is

		always on their side.



			Agreed:  break only at £40 m.



E.B.	I’m against the whole method.





	3.	Retail Food Prices.



M.W.	£107 m. additional costs.

	Milk is issue betwn. me and Ty.  We both recommend the rest.



E.Sh.	Meat increase of 3d a lb. if we get it fr. Argentine.  Surely we cd. let

		price rise v. much more – publ. opinion reconciled to it.  And

		save price increases on other things.  Better to put a big increase

		on meat than spread increases widely all over the place.  V. bad

		to increase tea prices by 8d.



A.V.A.	Only brings tea to 4/2 whereas in S. Doms. it’s over 6/=.



M.W.	3d a lb. for meat is only average price.  Better cuts will go up by 7d.



T.W.	What margin for home-killed.



M.W.	None.



E.B.	Go for a differential on quality – gives hope of tapering off subsidies.



J.G.	Bread/tea/margarine:  staples for our people.



H.G.	We took a/c of absolute amounts:  and pared off the big figures.  If

		that’s right approach, we can’t unload £30 m. on marg. &amp; tea on

		to other things.  Are you ready to put meat up by 6d?

M.W.	Don’t ignore para. 9.



A.B.	More on meat &amp; less on tea.           Agreed:  shd. be considered.



H.G.	Milk.		I want increase over short period mainly as experiment

		e.g. a 4 month period.  Doubt if consumptn will be affected.

		A v. small increase per pint.



T.W.	I don’t believe it wd. affect consumption.



			Agreed:  Re-adjust.

				[Exit  M.W.

				[Enter  P.M.G.

	4.	Post Office Tariffs.



N.E.	i)	Suppl. for £8 m. next Feb., if we don’t do        [Re-enter  C.E.

			this now.

	ii)	Telephones only.

	iii)	All charges suggd in memo.



H.G.	I have assumed for Budget tht. these increases wd. be made.  If not,

		we’re £10 m. down.



A.B.	Must be presented as trading increase ………….



E.B.	Cab. is handicapped by methods of adjustmt.



H.G.	On that, accept para. 11. procedure.



			Agreed:  Endorse para.11:  not to come back     [Exit  N.E.

			                                         to Cabinet.               [Enter  R.R.S.



	5.	Festival Gardens.



H.M.	Quite exceptionally bad weather:  labour troubles, bought off with

		extra pay.  Strain on management.  But, even so, disappointing

		situation.  Company form of organn preferred by Ty:  a good 

		Board.  But direct adminn (for S. Bank) has in fact done better.

	Had always wanted this to go on for 5 years.  Hope it will – almost

		permanent.

	Fin. Executive Director to be added to Board.



H.G.	Must be announced to-day.  P.A.C. will make awful trouble if we

		don’t.



H.McN.	How much of loss due to bad weather?



H.M.	About 50% due to circs. wh. cd. not have bn. foreseen.



J.	On 6/3 they led you to give quite misleading answer.  Only 2 days

		later tht. French gave quite a diff. figure to P.A.C.



R.R.S.	If another director, not a finance man:  someone with expce of fun

		fairs.

				[Exit  M.W.  Enter  B.



	6.	Transport Charges.



B.	B.T.C. will be puttg. their charges scheme to Tribunal v. soon:

		Tribunal will therefore agree to my adding 10% to freights.

	On other issues, I can find no reason to prevent B.T.C. fr. going to

		Tribunal.

		If Ty. will arrange for £2 m. relief on Service travel, it will 

		obviate increase in early morning fares &amp; suburban season

		tickets &amp; Green Line.  These together add up to £2 m.  

		V. advantageous politically to avoid this.  The rest of the 

		charges scheme shd. then go to Tribunal.



H.G.	I support this approach to the problem.

	On Ldn. fares, B.T.C. made out reasonable case.  Satisfied me.

		Anyhow this is technical point for Tribunal.

	Must plan on basis of getting these t’port undertakgs. out of the red.



E.Sh.	Must have discn re Service fares.



B.	There wd. be time for those discns.  All I need is to assure B.T.C. of

		rough amount of relief to them.



A.B.	Not much better in general.  Statemt. will frighten public.  Need

		M/T. say B.T.C. are going to Tribunal?



B.	Ques. bound to be asked.  I shall have to answer in Suppl. Ques.

		anyhow.



P.M.	Why not say it in less detail.



H.D.	Why accept increased fares at all.  Politically v. dangerous.



P.M.	Why is it urgent?



B.	I can’t get Tribunal to accept 10% on freights w’out promising them

		opportunity of genl. review.



A.B.	Can’t you say B.T.C. are not ready with fares scheme?



	{P.M.	Say B.T.C. are preparing to submit schemes ……

    Agreed	{

	{B.		V. well.  I can settle wording with H.G. &amp; P.M.



C.E.	Still want B.T.C. to pursue economics.
