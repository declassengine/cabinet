C.M. 36(50)							15th June 1950



		1.	Parliament.				[Enter Att.G. and W.W.



H.M.	Business for next week.

	Private Members’ Business. 16/6. Resale Price Maintenance.

				          23/6. Holiday Accommn for families 				          (cheap).



		At Party mtg. Wedy discn on Leasehold.  Rpt. has bn. recd.  Party 			pressure for some action – not known what – but agreed tht. 			moratorium be passed pendg. permanent legn.  I will have this 			examined and put memo. to Cab. and L.P. Cttee.



J.		Authy to press for early printing.  Agreed.

		Might get interim legn out of report – l.c.m. of agreement betwn. 			majority and minority repts.



A.B.		Prefer moratorium.  Any Bill wd. take a long time to draft.  M’while 		give sitting tenant right to go on sitting.



		Schuman Plan.



H.M.		Opposn inching. twds. takg. a Supply Day – on Monday week.  They 		may do it on Motion for redn.  If, however, they take supply formally 		and put down a Motion it wd. suit me (and us) for we cd. table an 			amendment.



		Smuts’ Illness.



P.M.		Rule – P.M.’s and Leaders of Parties.  But unusual case because Smuts 		was member of Imperial War Cabinet.  Casey is different – wasn’t a 		member of his own Govt. when he was in our War Cabinet.



G.W.		Afraid of repercussions eg. Malan. Wd. a b’cast be better?



H.M.		Leave it to P.M. to judge feeling of H/C.



P.M.		Spoke to W.S.C. – he will favour somethg.

		Favour doing it – makg. it clear that Smuts was exceptional qua 			member of War Cabinet.





		2.	Mr. MacManaway: Report of Select Committee.



Att. G.		i)  As he has taken his seat, we cd. say he relies on law and it must take 			its course.

		ii)  Refer to Judicial Cttee for advisory Cttee opinion and indemnity 				MacM.

		iii)  Legislate to restrict ineligibility to beneficed clergy in Eng. and 			Scotland.

		There wd. be criticism – R.C.’s might press for inclusion.



P.M.		I’m told hierarchy wd. not press for it.  They don’t allow priests to sit 		even on local councils in Eire.



Att.G		I still prefer course (ii) – tho’ Select Cttee rejected it.



P.M.		Diff. to take it now, when Sel. Cttee have turned it down.



R.S.C.		Normal course for a Govt. to take L.O.O.  



Att.G. 		No: in 1912 they took course (ii).



Att.G.		If Privy Council pronounced against, we cd. indemnify MacM. but not 		alter law for future.



H.M.		Wd. like course (i) but Tories may press in debate – amendmt. - free 		vote – v. awkward.



A.B.		As Cttee says posn. is obscure, Govt. can’t do nothing.  Favour (ii).



P.M.		What is status of advisory opinion?  Doesn’t bind the courts.



Att.G.		In fact courts wd. follow that opinion.



C.E.		If common informer succeeded, H.O. might come in. Mecca Café.

		Remn of Pen. Act 1875 empowers me to remit penalties recovered by 		commons informer in Sunday Observance cases.  Doubtful if I have 		power to remit in this case.



P.M.		Suppose advisory opinion is tht. he is in breach of law?  What do we 		do then?  He has incurred penalty.  How can we promise indemnity in 			advance?



A.		Course (i) is impossible. Govt. must do somethg. Course (ii) is the 			least we can do.



R.S.C.		Penalty doesn’t arise until sued for. Indemnity promise wd. only be a 		promise to oust common informer – i.e. to prevent an action.



Att.G.		This diffce if we promised it in advance of Privy Council opinion we 		shd. give him a licence to sit m’while.



R.S.C.		We need only decide to indemnify: we shd. not announce now what 		we wd. do about indemnity before Privy C. decides.



H.M.		Shall have to debate this.  Must make a case for not legislating as Sel. 		Cttee recommended.  Shall be pressed to state our intentions v. 			indemnity.



Att.G.		Need say no more than promise to consider.  For Indemnity Bills relate 		to past misdeeds: they don’t give licence to misbehavr.



H.McN.	Argument for promising indemnity in advance – we shd. thereby avoid 		disfranchising his constituents until law is made clear.



J.		Refer to Judicial Cttee promise (sympathetically) to consider 			indemnity ques. when opinion received, w’out commitment.



G.T.		Diffies of (ii) may be great.  But (i) or (iii)  Wd. be worse.



Att.G.		That ordinn under Act of 1801 = ordinn into establd church.



H.M.		I’m against that.



R.S.C.		Legn to make MacM.’s posn clear wdn’t clarify the law.

		Legn to clarify the law wd. be v. controversial.



		Agreed :	Advise H/C. to follow course (ii).

	

							[Exit W.W,. and Att.G.

							[Enter N.B., M.W., B. and

		3.	Economic Affairs.			 G.S.								

R.S.C.		State of “near boom”.  Risk of excessive optimism.

		Dangerous feature – b/paymts. overall balance is not developing as 		favourable as dollar balance.  Reason prob. = terms of trade not as 			favourable as we expected with non-dollar world.



H.W.		High import price of rubber, wood &amp; Jute.  But down overall balance 			and dollar balance no.



R.S.C.		Wd. be serious if it got worse.

		External trade also showg. more favourable trend of invisible than 			expected.

		Balance is on p. 4.  Gold and dollar holdings increased since last 			quarter of 250. : and 315 if followg. 2 weeks added.  Awkward for 			Congress debate on Appropn for E.C.A.



		Industry.  Coal is main worry.  More allocated to domestic use: means 		reducg. exports: N.C.B. believe damage to confidence and goodwill 		may be disastrous in loss of export markets.  Only way out: increased 		prodn.



N.B.		Target 205-210 m. meant 40-140.000 tons improvemt.  Now 54.000.

		Viz., above lower figure.  And 2nd half-year is apt to be better than 1st.

		Man power at face stable last 6 wks. if we can hold that, we may do 			better than expected. N.C.B. less worried than when they said 			what R.S.C. reported.



P.M.		V. serious prospect.  Cdn’t we have drive for increased output.  Appeal 		to men.  Only marginal increase of effort.



R.S.C.		I am spkg. at miners’ rally – will mention it.



H.M.	  	What of No. 10 mtg.



N.B.		Will make proposals.



A.B.		Mining is impossible in modern condns – no one will do it if he can 		earn living otherwise.  As society develops more attractive 				occupns you won’t get men to go down the mines.



		Against another campaign of exhortn.  Scientific re-organn is only hope 		for increased output.  Exhortn emphasises peculiarity of mining: want 		rather to stress its normality.  You can’t get coal by crusades.



E.Sh.		Support A.B.’s view.  Publicity: appeals are at least useless – may even 		be adverse.

		Mtg. of P.M. etc. with N.C.B. – to cross-examine them on speed of re-		organn might be worthwhile considering.

		Can’t blame the men: o.m.s. has risen and is above pre-war.

		[1947-8 nos. increased : now dropped to 700.000.]



P.M.		I don’t know enough to ask the ques.  I’m against both exhortn and a 		mtg. with N.C.B.



H.W.		Agree with P.M. Re-organn is procdg.

		Factors	 i)  smaller families and better educn means fewer 					     recruits for mining.

			ii)  condns are much better and we are almost m’taining 				     labour force.  And o.m.s. is rising: absenteeism falling.



		If we stop these appeals, we shall prob. get the coal.



J.G.		Cd. we know N.C.B.’s plans for future.  Reid Rpt. contemplated labour 		force of 500.000 and thght with mechann that we cd. get coal we 			need.  I went into pit at 13.  I wdn’t have gone at 15.  And now boys 		stay on at school until 15.



		Knowg. trends of man power, how do N.C.B. propose to offset them?

		Industry is quiet: no strikes: leave well alone on exhortn.

		Early July annual confce of N.U.M. will show feeling in industry.  Cd. 		have a private confce then with some members of Govt.



A.B.		N.C.B. and N.U.M. are not worried about long-term problem. 			Mechanisn will off-set drop in labour force.  Preparg. national plan: I 		expect it soon: we shall have to examine it before publn.

		M’while short-term improvemts. in output since ’46 are impressive.

		Juvenile intake is fairly good: problem is subsequent wastage before 		21 or so.

		13 m. days lost p.a. betwn. wars.  710.000 since natn   80.000 this year.

		Against genl. exhortn but we shd. get more done by lodge leaders.



H.M.		What are we going to do about it, then?  Let things drift?



A.B.		Need is for a stronger technical drive.



P.M. 		Short report fr. M/F. &amp; P. on technical development.



G.T.		Trouble still in relns betwn. men and local management.  Time is being 		lost over that – thro’ managerial incompetence.



G.A.I.		Generally there has bn. an improvement.  Disputes are being composed 		more quickly.  Wd. like to add somethg. on this in N.B. report.



		Exports.



H.W.		3½% increase in daily rate of exports in May.

		23 m. dollars to U.S. in May – record.  To Canada 34.7 m. in May.



		Textiles.



H.W.		Cotton and wool prodn is moving well.  Synthetic fibres (to avoid 			imported materials).  Rayon ⅓rd more than last year.  Nylon 6 times 			more than early ’49 and price is dropping.  Shd. help clothing 			prices – summer dresses at 20/=.



		Nylon figures shd. be included in Econ. Rpt. (?)

		Nylon hose. 20 m. p.a. to home market.  Quality better than U.S., wh. 		have now bn. made to ladder so as to sell more.



E.Sh.		P. 2.  A misconceived point.



H.D.		9% - beats prophecies.  Experts said only 4½%.  Re-inforces my point 		tht. plans based on pessimistic estimates.



R.S.C.		E.P. Union.



		At beginning this wk. arranged method (in Paris with Fr. and U.S. and 			others).

		Main point was gold point.  Times today: Belg. Govt. have rejected it. 		Will be awkward to hold others to it – in view of Paris attitude on 			Labour Party manifesto.  May mean we shan’t get E.P.U.



		Man Power.



A.		Para. 4 suggests we have made no impn on unemplt. in dev. areas.

		Debate H/L.  Said factories doing well in these areas were being 			prevented fr. expanding their activities.   2/5ths of total emplt. is in 			dev. areas.



H.W.		Recovery is lagging.  Tho’ over 1000 new factories, unemplt. is 			no less.  Reason mainly: no. of new factories have dropped away.

		Dollar investmt test has inhibited some expansion of factories.

		See my memo. to Prodn Cttee.



H.D.		Quicker and better results fr. concentratg. on extensions of existg. 			factories via bldg. new ones.  



H.W.  		We need both.



C.E.		Emplt. openings for men all sadly needed in dev. areas.



							[Exit M.W., B. and N.B.

		4.	Iron and Steel Act.



G.S.		If we want Corpn on 1/10 and resting on 1/1/51, I must go ahead now.

		But I can’t get a Corpn if there is to be an Election in autumn.

		The best people in the industry will wait to see results of Election.

		Don’t want to start with weak Corpn.  Wd. wreck chances of success.

		My concln : we must announce before 1/10 tht. we propose a 			p’ponemt. eg. for 3 months.



P.M.		This raises ques. about date of Election which we shd. discuss w’out 		offls.



		[Secretariat then withdrew.]
