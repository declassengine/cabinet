C.M. 31(50)							                   15th May 1950



		1.	Canadian Wheat and Flour.	       [Enter M.W., K.Y., and H.G.



M.W.	No time for prior Ministerial talks because time of visit advanced.

	Our objective: freedom to buy on best terms: help b/payments.

	Freedom limited by W. Agreemt.  Don’t want it more limited, esp. when signs of buyers’ market.

	See C.R.O. point and wd. like to be kind to Canadians.  But if b/payments permd I wd. sooner spread any concessions over other Canadian supplies.  Salmon and cheese prob. only food supplies.  Don’t do it on wheat.

	Don’t want to make any concession on “have regard to” clause.  Wd. prefer para. 14 method.



G.W.	i)  Is it so certain tht. market will move our way?  Not so sure we shall succeed in forcing down dollar price.  Anyway, don’t like trying to force collapse of prices for wheat over and above: I.W.A. quantities.

	We don’t want wheat prices to fall too low – start slumps and causes ill will.



	ii)  Not askg. for kindness to Canadians – only for wise political judgmt. to get support of Canadian Ministers for expansion of our imports into Canada.



	iii)  “Have regard to”. In view of what we said in ’48, we can’t take the line that there’s nothg. to discuss.  We admd then tht. there was some oblign.



	Proposal to buy quantity fr. Canada via U.S. is prob. good way of liquidatg. the oblign.  But start by admittg. tht. there is some.

	His tactics wd. risk an early explosion.

	There is a case for offering to take even more fr. Canada. – wheat.

	Also favour discussg. easements on other supplies (viz., takg. more).



R.S.C.	Start fr. Comm. agreemt. to cut dollar imports to 75%.  We can’t depart unilaterally from that.  Until our p’mme for next 6 months is worked out in a few weeks, don’t know how much more we can take. Want these discns limited therefore to wheat.  Other Comm. countries are honouring that decision – important to hold it.



	Must avoid pledging ourselves to buy wheat we don’t need for human consumptn.  If we buy max. non-dollar wheat we can under I.W.A. we shall need only 105 m. bushels fr. dollar countries – and none fr. R. or Argentine.  We shd. concentrate that dollar purchase on Canada.  Esp. now tht. no E.C.A. dollar diffy. will arise we shan’t get any for Can. wheat – we can give flat undertakg. to buy all our dollar wheat fr. Canada.



	At what price?  Havg. signed I.W.A. after much discn, to stabilise wheat prices (85% of our wheat betwn. the margins prescribed) …. Looks as tho’ there will be surplus next year.  We shd. offer to buy on a negotiated price – and will take a/c of Cl. 2(b) to warrant somethg. more than minimum.  That shd. be the area of bargaining – only on price.  Want any concession for “have regard” to be on price. Thus i) keep this to wheat  ii) firm promise of 105 m.  iii) bargain on price, to wipe off Cl.2(b).



M.W.	Canadians won’t like that. Prairie provinces repd by Howe, who will want to do as much for them as Gardiner wd. have done.  But they must be expectg. a drop.

	Other supplies.  Even tho’ not raised now, we may soften him later with these.



A.B.	What is our storage capacity for wheat?



M.W.	At present we have 16 wks supply and find diffy. in finding storage.



A.B.	I.W.A. not satisf.  World surplus next year of 500 m. bushels.  If some unsold, producers may cut down sowing.  Isn’t this the sort of surplus for wh. internatl machinery for buying and storing shd. be available?



M.W.	1946/7 : buffer stock scheme was opposed by us.  But under I.W.A. there is provn for both producers and buyers to store in event of surplus.

	We have now had 8 good harvests running.  Ought to be a carry over to prevent our havg. to go to R. for supplies if there is a bad harvest in w. hemisphere.

	U.S. have stored up to capacity.



A.B.	Cd. M/F. summarise, for A.B.’s informn, stage reached in internatl discn of surplus.



P.M.	Back to Canada.  M/F. line was too tough.  C.R.O. may be too soft.

	R.S.C.’s compromise seems about right.  Mustn’t be too rough in negotiation.



H.M.	Endorse.  Concerned about Canada. They were v. generous and helpful to us when our stock posn was bad.  Their econ. posn isn’t v. strong. Must therefore be careful in our approach.  Also our export posn needs watchg.  A pinch of generosity wdn’t be out of place.  Shall have some trouble over this – don’t have undue trouble.



K.Y.	U.S. wd. have no cause for complaint if we bought all our dollar wheat fr. Canada.  Nor (para.14) cd. they object to our going above the price.



	Long-term : Canada will be a better commercial friend and more reliable supplier than eg. Argentine or Australia.

	Favour a gentler approach then that proposed by M/F.

T.W.	Animal feed.  Keep door open. Might pay us better to buy Can. wheat for animals.  Don’t press this now.

	Get as much wheat and as little flour, as we can.  For wheat offals is best animal feed.



A.	Support P.M. and H.M.

	He will start fr. fact tht. we are comg. down fr. 140 m. to 105 m. bushels.

	Quite imposs. to say nothg. left in “have regard to”.

	Will prob. have to go beyond years’ supply, in discns and talk of storage.  For Howe will be concerned about a big Can. surplus.

	Start reasonably on price.  Don’t rule out any mention of other supplies, in later stages.

	Must make conciliatory approach.



A.B.	Show decn to buy Can. timber means tht. our stocks are about to sink to level dangerous to housg. p’mme.



	Hope there will be no such generosity in these wheat talks tht. there is no dollar room for more purchases of timber.



H.W.	Dollar expce recently authorised.



H.G.	It was last autumn’s shortage of dollars – thereafter failure to deliver.

	

H.D.	Wheat.  Para.13.  Buying thro’ trade.  Change of practice.



R.S.C.	Ty. have asked for this to be held up. 



H.D.  	Good.



J.	Dec. ’48 we clearly admitted tht. somethg. was left under Cl. 2(b).

	Bad tactics to deny this.



R.S.C.	 I made it clear in ’48 tht. in our view the oblign was extinguished.

	They know that.  But we will be polite.



H.W.	Will be difficult.  Esp. as our dollar balance is improvg. so much.

	They will recur to “triangular economy”.

	What are we to say about purchases fr. R.?



R.S.C.	We can say tht., for human consumptn we aren’t going to R. market. Tho’ we might do it for animal feed.



G.W.	App. B. p.15.  Drop in wheat consumptn as cpd. with pre war.  Is this the extraction  rate?  Shd. we not have more wheat and more animal feed.



H.W.	These are imports – expln is increased home prodn.



P.M.  	No talk v. other supplies until p’mme known and prs. Cab. authy.



	Negotns to be based on R.S.C.’s formula : 	                         [Exit K.Y.

	tactical approach to be tactful and kind.





		2.	Minimum Prices for Livestock : Livestock Products.



T.W.           x/	Too many eggs: by 1952/53.



P.M.	Really? Or too high a price?



M.W.	Really a ques. of price.  We are having to reduce prices in order to sell off surplus supplies.



R.S.C.	Ques. really is best distn of £400 m. food subsidies.  Eggs, beef etc.

	Needs more considn from that angle.



T.W.	Back to x/.  Propose no quantitative restn but minimum prices to discourage any excessive prodn of milk or eggs.  Suggest 30-35% lower than current prices.  2/6d. per doz. for eggs.

	Other suggns re livestock.

	All this based on 50% drop in feeding stuff prices over next few years.

	Won’t be easy to negotiate this with farmers.

	Wool : trying for 11% below current.  We are makg. big profits on sales - £2 m. this year.

	Farmers, if these prices are fixed too low, wdn’t reach targets and wd. produce more ill-will than food.  These proposals are the most we dare to go.



R.S.C.	App I. last column are percentages of current prices – not minimum guaranteed for 1951/52.  It’s this expectn of future prices that influences his behaviour.  On that basis, these minima are on the high side.  Only a support price. E.g. cattle : same as before.

	No justificn for pigs being treated the same.  Nor for eggs and milk.

	Wool : first time price has bn. guaranteed.  In view of high world prices, wh. will be m’tained, this is too high.

	Want all these prices scaled down – by not v. much.



T.W.	Pig price increase.  All feed stuffs subsidies removed.  And we haven’t reached ⅔ of pre-war pig populn.  Want further encouragemt. to breeding.



M.W.	Support livestock proposals. Object to milk/eggs proposals.

	Eggs : we can’t sell more than a certain amount at a high price.

	Can’t reduce price w’out more subsidy.  Diff., when working under a ceiling.

	Milk : propose 1/9.   



T.W.  	Accept.

	Eggs :      “      2/6 for 1952/53 and ⅔ for 1953/54.  For by then that will be nearer economic price.  And we must eventually enable supplies to be taken up.



A.B.	Examine this again. 



E.Sh. 	Includg. reference to subsidy.

	May have to revise views of subsidy ceiling, or we shall be “discouraging production”.



H.D.	If you reduce prices to farmers and keep retail price the same, this reduces the subsidy.



H.M.	Want a child’s guide to all this.



P.M. 	Agricultural Dpts.)  	to consider, officials

	M/Food	     )	first and then report to

	Ty.		     )	Ministers concerned.



	If they disagree, further report to Cabt.



A.	Mistake to reduce milk below 2/=.  Price for eggs is too high.



P.M.	As above.

	Also genl. memo. on retail prices and wthr. they will drop as farmers’ prices are reduced.





		3.	Recognition of Staff Associations.		[Enter N.Ed.



		Memo. approved, subject to minor change in final para. of statement.





		4.	Scottish Affairs.



H.McN.	Scott. Labour group members are now favouring M/State for Scottish housing.



	Covenant deputn.  W.S.C. said to be unwilling to receive them.  P.M. also disposed against. In any reply, we must make it clear there is no ques. of “negotiating” with them.



H.M.	If W.S.C. saw them, politically unwise for P.M. to decline.

	They are taken seriously in Scottish Press.  Wdn’t it be worthwhile for P.M. to see them for a moment and hand them onto S/S. for more detailed discussion.



C.E.	Wd. you then have P.M. receive a Welsh Nat. depn.



A.B.	Need for care.  Courtesy, but no overt action.  Concessions to these nat. feelings never assuage them – only sharpen appetites.

	When we are aiming at integration in Europe, madness to favour separation in U.K.

	Can’t hold W. nationalism if concessions made to Scotland.

	Concessions made to Wales have not satisfied W. nationalism.



A.	Commonsense line is to see these people and persuade them of their folly.  Speak to them with brutal frankness.



H.McN.	Can’t be sure how much weight there is behind this.

	But believe there is some restlessness.

	Might give them undue encouragemt. if P.M. received them.

	

P.M.	Receivg. them wd. blacken faces of Scott. M.P.s?  Wd. it not be better if I offered to receive deputn of Scott. M.P.s on this subject.



H.McN.  	I will take soundings on that point.



H.M.	Committee.  Has this bn. agreed with R.S.C.



H.G.	We aren’t against the appointment of the Cttee.



A.B.	Defer announcement of Cttee.



H.G.	Want to see names, first.



H.McN.	Shd. announce before Covenanters are seen.



A.	Don’t think Cttee. is necessary.



P.M.  	Bring up supply. memo. (names) on Thursday.
