C.M. 7(51).				        25th January, 1951.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  Att.G., Taylor,

				             K.Y.

H.M.	Business for next week.

	S of S. War &amp; Att. Gen:  spokesman on Ct. Martial (Appeals) 

		Bill:  29/1. – if E.Sh. is still away.



P.M.	Defence statement as early as poss.  I prefer 29/1.  Debate can follow

		a week later.



H.M.	Opposn also want debate on Steel.  Agreed:  resist that.  Suppls

		debated already.



H.G.	Form of Defence Debate – how work in economic side:  to be 

		considered by H.M.  May need a day for this aspect.



P.M.	They may press for S. Session.  Case for it may be stronger now.



A.B.	Risk of causing undue alarm – greater now.  Danger of war hysteria.



P.M.	Public statement:  but might accept Secret Session as well,

		subsequently.



H.M.	Early statement on Z. reservists – in advance of general announcemt.



P.M.	Wait for Monday.



H.M.	Opposn demand for debate of Coal next week.



H.W.	Wait 2 wks. until we know wtr. we shall have allocn scheme for 

		industry.		

					[Exit Taylor.



	2.	Korea.   



K.Y.	On U.S. resoln, we shall be deserted by all white Comm.

	Jebb’s telegram.  Expects, at end, to have to vote on resoln as it stands.

		If he votes against, prob. will have few but Arab Asiatics with 

		him.



P.M.	Vote on Asian resoln?



K.Y.	Unlikely to get much support.  (Jebb).

	Australian did make suggn re rejection by Peking:  but not v. forceful.

	Peking’s further elucidation.  i) assurance tht. Ch. volunteers will be

		w’drawn.  ii) cease-fire to be arranged, &amp; period, at outset of

		confce .  iii) confce shd. fix principles on wh. Korean internal 

		set-up shd. be determined.  iv) Taiwan:  come down now to 

		w’drawal of U.S. troops.  v) recognition:  to be affirmed by 

		conference – i.e. not a pre-condition.  Finally, Peking willing to

		accept prelimy conference.

	Rau will presumably announce all this to-day.



A.B.	Bit advance  i) admit conference w’out pre-condns.

			  ii) admit conference, not Koreans, shd. settle future 

			             set-up in Korea.

	Shd. we not urge course of getting them in to conference.



P.M.	It is important change:  have informed Jebb:  must wait.



K.Y.	Doubt if U.S. will in fact stop short of sanctions after branding.



H.G.	We are mtg. aggression, militarily, in Korea.  No gt. harm in branding.

		Cd. stand on that, &amp; go no further.

			                                            [Enter  3 Serv. Ministers, C.O.S.

			                                              G.S., Wheatley.

			                                                                

	3.	Courts-Martial:  Other Ranks Representation.



P.M.	On this, I advise v. advocatg. “other ranks” representn.



J.	B’burn’s plan:  not to take part in sentence.  Hopeless.



A.B.	Will all courts contain offr. who have bn. thro’ ranks.  



C.A.S.	All do 6 months.



C.N.S.	Discipline is for officers.  Can’t bring ratings in on that.



C.A.S.	Officer trained from outset in mil. law.  Has to have 2 yrs. service

		before sitting on ct. martial.

	Officer must be responsible for discipline, judgment etc.  Must not

		lower his status.



A.H.	My views stand:  but I won’t press them.



Att.G.	V. well:  but don’t use C.O.S. arguments – certainly not tht. other 

		rank repve wd. be friend of accused ranker.



H.McN.	Political merit in makg. this gesture.

	Not impressed by C.O.S. arguments.  Shd. not be a strain on 

		discipline.



H.D.	Need this point be in Wh. Paper?  Was only minority recommn by

		Blackburn.



			Present White Paper:  but don’t mention this point in it.

				                                                    					[Exit  L.O.’s.

	4.	Defence Programme.



P.M.	As in brief.

	Invited genl. discn of scale of p’mme.

	We offered £3.600 m. on basis of U.S. aid.  No aid now likely.  But

		we’ve agreed to increase.  Must consider impact – on economy

		&amp; on morale.  On need:  must give a lead to W. Europe.

		We don’t know R.’s intentns:  but clear they cd. over-run Europe

		now, unless defences strengthened.  I don’t think they will 

		because cdn’t win long war.

	This plan means:  Naval defence v. R. subs.

			           Army support to W. Europe.

			            Large increase in R.A.F., wh. is too weak on 

			                   turnover to new types.



H.G.	My memo. discusses economic consequences, at some length.

	Main points.  Excldg. stock-piling (transfer of assets) £500 m. more =

		£800 m:  £1.000 m. – increases in the 3 years – excldg. cost of 		new capacity.

	This burden comes when we face  a) worse terms of trade for ’51.

		b) raw material shortages.  c) no dollar aid assumed – tho’ we

		may get a little in kind.

	Direct effect of engineering, bldg. &amp; textiles.  First 2 are producg.

		for investmt &amp; export – both must be affected.

	What can we afford on exports?  Surplus of £200 m. on b/payments		this year.  Adopt new target of balance – excldg. stock-pilg.

		This prob. means accumuln of sterling balances.  But can wear

		that so long as we don’t get adverse balance.

	Investmt:  must try to limit effects because damage to industry.

	Try therefore to carry most on consumptn.  Higher exports consumer		goods.

		Drawg. new labour fr. consumptn industry.  Put defence orders

		into durable consumer goods part of engineering industry.

	Need to put max. orders in Europe for defence prodn.  Urge this on

		Supply Dpts.

	Double switch:  first to defence &amp; then to export, vice home 

		consumptn.  Must therefore a) discourage consumer expendre –

		Budget  b) physical controls reducg. supplies to home market.

		i) Mat. allocns:  ii) direct controls over prodn – prohibitg. certain		manufactures &amp; LIMOSA.:  iii) some labour controls in due

		course.  (Tho’ big pol. problem:  T.U.C. members of E.P.B. 

		advise no public statemt. yet because workers not prepd for it.)		iv) Dirns to firms.  v) Requisition of factory space, when

		necessary:  machinery being reviewed.  v) Priority:  no

		over-riding priority.  Genl. statemt. of its importce &amp; machinery		for settling disputes.  vi) Delays in civil bldg. p’mmes.  Must

		be no increase in total bldg. labour force.  May affect housing

		locally in some areas.  vii) Re-phasing of this p’mme on 

		textiles (uniforms) is essential.  For we need more exports from

		

		them to replace engineering exports.  viii) Civil Service man-

		power.



	Effects:	B/payments.  Let us decide new target.

		     	S/living.  Increased productivity:  assume 4%.  Depends

			on r. materials.  Many think it optimistic.  On this basis, 

			some redn in real investmt:  supplies of manufd consumer

			goods will be reduced – 5% redn by end/3rd year.  Total

			cosumptn won’t be affected to this extent.  Fall of

			10-15% in cloth for home market:  might involve 

			rationing.  May be increase in savings also.

	Over whole field of consumptn this isn’t much.  But people expect a

		rise in consumer standards, esp. if incomes rising.

	This apprecn includes a rise in c/living.  Diff. problem of distribn.

		Fixed income groups (pensioners etc.) will be in diffies.



	Conclns:	i)    Several enquiries still to be made:  cf. memo.

			ii)   If we accept p’mme, we must accept its implicns –

			              fiscal, controls, redn in consumptn.

			iii)  Service &amp; Supply Dpts. must not think they can spend

			              all they wish.  They must be even more austere in

			              standards.  E.g. in their use of man-power.

			       All Ty. scrutiny of detailed expre will continue.

			iv)   Publicity:  diffy. in puttg. this across.

	Phasing.  Heaviest burden about 2nd year.  Before that, stocks in shops

		to be run down.  In 3rd year, rate of expre declines.  Autumn ’51 to

		spring of ’53 wd. be worst period.



A.B.	T.U.C. opposed any announcemt. of labour controls.  But I can’t have

		heroic p’mme &amp; appear cowardly in w’holding labour control.

		Yet shan’t want that control in 1st year.

	V. diff. therefore Cab. shd. ask if this scale of p’mme is necessary.

	One good feature:  shift mainly w’in engineering &amp; textile indies.

		Avoids problems of movemt.

	But on this in 1952 there will be need of stiff powers.

	Accommn diffies limits mobility.

	If you don’t enlarge bldg. industry (&amp; I agree you shdn’t.) but have this

		p’mme, you can’t get 200.000 houses.  Labour will be drawn

		away fr. housing, wh. is {least profitable/not attractive form  

		of bldg.  Better to say p’mme is being scaled down than face 

		failure.

	You can’t tie labour to housg. vice other forms of bldg.

	This p’mme involves £35 m. more bldg. at once:  bound to be at 

		expense of housing.

	We must either reject the bldg. elements in this p’mme }

		Or cut down the housing p’mme.



P.M.	We must look at this.



A.B.	There are new methods by wh. to increase house bldg. in particular

		areas.  Also factories in unorthodox materials.

	Fall in woman-power.  Over next few years men will have to take

		their place.  Generally 24-40 age group is smaller.

	Do assumptns in this p’mme conflict with our earlier aim of not

		crippling our economy.  I believe this p’mme wd. impair our

		economy.

	Consequences of r. mats shortages will be more serious than is here

		assumed.

	Concln:  this is over-accelerated p’mme.  Impact excessive.

		Moral will be undermined.  Nothg. in internatl sitn to call for

		increase on that scale.



C.N.S.	Diff. to forecast future.  But sitn can be dangerous.  For 150 yrs. R. has

		recoiled when opposed by strength.  Has happened – e.g. Berlin

		air-lift.

		We now know R. was behind Ch. moves in Korea.

		R. has moved 4 Divns into M’churia.  Has secret treaty with R.

	Eur. satellites have increased forces by appr. 30%.

	In E. Germ. ? R. troops 300.000 above normal.  Empty “flats” 

		going back to R. - ? for A.F.V.’s.

	Is all this prompted by fear of attack, or by planning of a new 

		adventure?  Korea doesn’t imply fear:  rather the opposite.

	Persia &amp; Yugosl. threatened.

	At present, we haven’t the strength to meet any further probes, still

		less genl. attack.



P.M.	Invited detail…….

	Why is ’52 more dangerous than ’54.



C.N.S.	Betwn. 52 &amp; 54 they will prob. be ready to take on a fairly long war.



C.A.S.	Korea has shown readiness of Comm. Powers to take more risks than

		we thght.  They didn’t disarm after ’45.  If we remain in hopeless

		inferiority, they will continue to nibble until we are finally faced

		with major sitn.



K.Y.	Inter-action of U.S. &amp; R. policies.  Attitude of U.S. – acceleration all

		round.  R. realise that.  Know they have advantage for next 2 or

		3 yrs.  Korea shows R. ready to play with fire.  Diff. to restrain

		U.S. – unless we are strong enough to deal with R. on local

		basis.  We must therefore be readier to meet small incidents.



J.S.	Endorse that fr. Service angle.

	But we have to decide precise scale.

	Consider basis on wh. this acceleration was arrived at.  Hypothesis

		given.  “War possible 1951:  prob. 1952.”  The 2nd part of this

		must have meant war inevitable in ’52.  This p’mme, above the

		£3.6, results from that.  Everythg. physically possible wd. 

		therefore be brght. in



J.	No need to put it like that.  Our weakness relatively is obvious.

	Can’t be too big for mil. reasons.  Only for econ. reasons.  Can only

		conclude it’s too big if it makes us not viable economically.



P.M.	We have not accepted “inevitable” or “probable”.  We recognise 

		periods of special risks.



C.N.S.	We thght. 1952 R. cd. go to war.  In 1951 war merely “possible”.  But

		betwn. 1952-5. R. cd. go to war with some prospect of not being

		defeated.



G.S.	C.O.S. asked us to increase existg. p’mme as rapidly as poss., assumg.

		man-power &amp; r. materials.  This is result.



H.W.	Economic possibility.  Believe sights are set too high.

		Man-power:  650.000 more into def. prodn.  Almost size of ‘40

		turnover.  (H.G.  This = 3 years.)

		Materials:  believe defence p’mme will get what it needs, tho’

			others go short.

		Capacity:  may aim too high on certain items &amp; as result get less.

			Some prodn too high:  &amp; other not nearly enough.

		Machine tools:  dangerous bottle-neck.

	Exports.  Don’t believe we shall keep a balance in b/payments.

		Accept target:  but doubt if we’ll reach it.

		a)  Clash with U.S. on dollar-export drive.  Tho’ we shall fight 

			them.

		b)  Engineering can’t make anythg. like same contn to exports as

			before.  Memo. therefore proposes substitute consumer

			goods.  We must try:  but won’t do the trick.  SEA. want

			capital goods.  Comm. countries don’t want more consumer

			goods.

		c)  Clothing:  consequence wd. be (cotton only) ¼ of

			availabilities in 1950, if all this p’mme were adopted, 

			incldg. export targets.

	Stricter &amp; more detailed control over investment will be required.

		Private sector must come under more control.

	Building:  need to revive Mobile Buildg. Squads in M/W.



G.S.	If we accepted this p’mme we cd. carry it out.

	But effects on economy haven’t bn. realised.

	Even £3.6 p’mme wd. have bn. serious, esp. in 2nd year.  It assumed 

		only 250.000 more labour.  Later raised to 375.000.

		This = 650.000.

	Raw material shortages.  How assume 4% increase prodivity?

	V. serious effect on exports.

	And, anyhow, all depends on machine tools.



A.	Not over-large scale qua need.

	But 12-18 mos. before it gets into stride.

	No alarm over 1st part of p’mme.  Time to grapple with diffies as

		p’mme develops.

	Reserve of productivity in U.K.



H.D.	Can’t accept new bldg. part of p’mme w’out more detailed examinn.

		Is this claim reasonable?

	Can’t prodn be done in existg. factories – by switching over.

	Don’t at this stage  i) agree to any redn in housg. p’mme.

			            ii)  be commd to increasg. bldg. labour force.

	In general:  aren’t we over-doing this?  £3.6 was a lot.  Now more.

		Impact on morale.  Can’t sustain that if people lose consumer

		goods they had bn. counting on.



A.	They must have more food, whatever the cost.



H.W.	Can’t be sure we’ve set our sights too high until examd industry by

		industry.  Therefore, accept this genl. target but keep flexibility.



P.M.	Don’t want announce unrealistic target.

	We shall be asked for a figure – here &amp; by U.S.

	I don’t want to announce £4.500.  Don’t mind giving this year’s 

		figure.



H.G.	NATO pressures.  Diff. to avoid indicn of future.



H.M.	3 year p’mme necessary for planning.

	Public must be warned &amp; got into right mood.

	On labour control, when asked, we shd. say we don’t rule it out if it

		becomes necessary.

	F. sitn.  Risks are v. gt.  Our responsibilities are v. heavy.

	Suppose R. slipped into war.  ADGB. posn is v. thin.

		Even commns system isn’t ready.

	Believe tht., with diffy, we cd. just about stand this p’mme.

		And I’m sure it’s necessary.



A.B.	Are we going to tell R. – thro’ Parlt. or N.A.T.O. – tht. by ’52 we shall

		have this weight of armament.

	R.’s economic &amp; industrial potential.



P.M.	Their economy was geared to war.  And they haven’t disarmed.



A.B.	Why not put out a p’mme beyond 3 years &amp; say that, with m. tools &amp;

		r. mats, we shall bring that fwd. as much as poss.



C.E.	A.B.’s view – fallacious.  For public in U.K. don’t think we are at

		peace.  And will expect Govt. to face their responsibilities.

		Shocked by what I’ve heard this morning e.g. fr. B/T.

		Doesn’t affect my view.  We must face sitn &amp; not run away from

		implications.  Not afraid of stating a figure, with some qualificns.





H.G.	a)	On textiles, my figures are quite difft. from B/T.

			10-15% redn, as I said.  V. diff. picture from H.W.’s.

	b)	Global consumptn:  this means all increment in prodn &amp; surplus

			in b/payments.  No more.  Tho’ w’in it, pattern will be 

			diff.  Mainly a ques. of holdg. consumptn where it is.

	c)	My concln:  we can’t take risk of paring this down.  Nor can we

			now start another enquiry into what is practicable.



G.S.	Doubts about m. tools.



H.G.	What can we say?

	How, at this stage, can we avoid giving a figure?  We can qualify.

		Or difft. years – first 2 firmer.



P.M.	Give p’mme total:  may get it in so many years or not:  shall try to 

		reach it as quickly as possible.

		Firm on total.  But elasticity on timing.

		Genl. concln:  pledged to increase &amp; accelerate.

			              not sure we can reach this p’mme in 2 years.

			              announce p’mme, but not related to a date:  have

			              flexibility on timing.
