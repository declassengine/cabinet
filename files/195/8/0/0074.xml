C.M. 20(51).				15th March, 1951.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  W.W.



C.E.	Business for next week.

	Silverman’s point.  No need to have a Govt. view.



H.G.	We shd. win this debate.  Improper for M.P. to send a constituent’s

		letter to his superior officer.



A.B.	Clerks at Table think it is breach of privilege, as undermining 

		authority of Parlt.  Our supporters wd. be anxious tht. we shd.

		support Silverman.



C.E.	But a ques. of privilege shdn’t be made a Party matter.

	Not even ques. of referring it to Cttee.

	Tory M.P.’s who receive any “Left” lr. (e.g. on G. re-armament) send

		them on to me qua security.



T.W.	Lr. fr. tenant of Council house:  shd. it be fwded to Council.  Be sure

		a general ruling doesn’t trip you up.



J.	What of lrs. to me complaining re Magistrate.



E.Sh.	Only ques. for Cab. is wtr. members of Govt. shd. support reference

		to Cttee of Privileges.  Tellers won’t be on.



W.W.	We can secure this.



A.V.A.	Normal for Front Bench to support Speaker.  Leader of House 

		shdn’t support Silverman’s motion.



P.M.	No oblign to support Speaker’s ruling on a matter of this kind.





	2.	Reserve Forces Bill.



A.	Tories will press to a divn two points.



A.V.A.	a)	Cl. 7.  Repeat H/C. amendmt to give T.A. same protn as Class Z.

	b)	Cl. 12.  Power to continue by O-in-C. from year to year.



E.Sh.	Cab. view was against a).  In H/C. we said T.A. Assocns consulted

		&amp; genl. view was tht. it shd. be left to good will of employers.

	On b) I argued we cdn’t foresee future circs.



A.B.	a) was discussed with J.I.C., who unanimously agreed men wd. be

		better off w’out this statutory requirement.



			Agreed:  resist both amendments.

E.Sh.	Govt. amendment.  Claim to exemption may be made, on hardship

		grounds, w’in 7 days.





	3.	N.A.T.O. Command Structure.



E.Sh.	Statement might be made on Business re W. Papers on command

		structure.



E.B.	Don’t get into way of W. Papers on personal apptmts.



P.M.	Opposn are content to p’pone debate until after Easter.



C.E.	i)	Ike’s appointmts:  recommns now under consn by S. Group.

	ii)	Med. command:  must go to N.A. Def. Cttee &amp; Council.



A.B.	Better avoid discn to-day if you can.  Wd provoke a series of

		interrogns.  Wd suffice to say merely that apptmts aren’t complete.



P.M.	Keep it short and say as little as you can.





	4.	Council of Europe.



H.M.	Germany has tabled request for full membership.

	They are there as observers.  Has bn. agreed they shd. have 

		For. Secy.

	I favour admn.  Possible French wd. agree.

	But shd. we adjourn to May mtg. – because if we admit them now,

		R. might re-act v. it in prelimies to C.F.M., as we wd. admit as

		“Germany”.  We cd. be sympathetic.



H.McN.	V. inexpedient to do it this week-end.



A.V.A.	If you get a C.F.M., they’ll say don’t do it because of that.



H.McN.	You will at least have an agenda by then.



			Agreed:  Postpone.

				[Enter  Barnes.

				[Exit   W.W.

	5.	Transport Charges.



B.	Seen Hurcomb.  He agrees to w’hold increase of monthly returns.

	On submn of other fares to Tribunal, no alternatives but to go fwd.

		Doesn’t follow Tribunal will accept B.T.C. proposals:  &amp; will

		take time.

	I can announce 10% increase of freights – under Cab. decision.

	I want decision on fares to be clearly for Tribunal, not for me.

 

H.G.	Ques:  can we do more to prevent B.T.C. fr. going to Tribunal.

		We have no power to stop them.  Shd. we argue again with them?

	My alleviations are found to be only £2-3 m.

	I think they are askg. too much for Ldn.  Prob. because they expect to 

		be whittled down.

	We cd. advise them to ask for £5 m. vice £10 m.  But no more.



A.B.	No new facts.  Why vary decision.

	B.T.C. are seekg. revenue (not to get current finance right) but

		to wipe out old arrears.

	We natd transport.  Public will think it’s Govt. wh. raised fares.

		Headlines while Tribunal is sitting:  will damage us even if

		Tribunal rejected appln.  Leave it alone, and let B.T.C. 

		economise.



H.G.	Under the Act the decn on fares rests with Tribunal, not with Govt.

	Can be a long-run enquiry into road/rail ques., as H.W. asked.

	No profit by B.T.C. on roads:  £3 m. on other activities:  nothg. to

		off-set against rlway. losses.



B.	Always being pressed to introduce charges scheme as soon as poss.

	Everyone knows 10% on freights won’t meet deficit.

	Will be apparent we are flouting Act.



C.E.	a)	Socd indies when in diffies shdn’t at once raise charges.

	b)	B.T.C. &amp; similar bodies mustn’t make exaggerated bids in

		expectn of being whittled down.  Will undermine confidence 

		in such (public) bodies.



H.McN.	Thought we had deferred even decn of freights until known what effect

		16⅔rds increase had on traffic.

	In political fact we are responsible, even tho’ Tribunal is theoretically.



A.V.A.	Then we must also take responsibility for sound finance by B.T.C.

	Over £40 m. deficit already.  No suggn fr. A.B. that this will be met.

	Responsibility cuts both ways.



G.T.	Support C.E.  Also the headlines during Tribunal’s hearing.

	Set off £40 m. against £150 m. reserves.



A.	Support C.E. and A.B.

	Fundamental weakness.  Public not satisfied with B.T.C. efficiency:

		why shd. consumer pay more.  Efficiency is the answer.

		Increased fares will only lose traffic.  We shd. not countenance

		appln unless linked with effective improvemt. on service.

	“No profit fr. roads.”  What about Pickford’s profits.



P.M.	Increased fares won’t increase revenue.  Must consider more broadly.

		Always a national asset.  What do we pay to m’tain them.



B.	Deficit partly due to increased wages – imposed on B.T.C. by Cab.

		decision against sense of responsibility of management.



J.G.            x/	No-one will use rlways who can avoid it.  Burden will be laid on

		v. small section of industry (freights) and public (fares).

		They can’t even capture the market for cup-ties – fr. coaches.



H.G.	Don’t forget genl. background of increasg. prices &amp; costs (incldg.

		wages).

	Rlways did not lose traffic from 16⅔ increase.



E.Sh.	Can’t expect every wage increase to be followed by price increase.

		Must have greater efficiency.

	On short-run:  support B.  We authorised the wage increase.  We can’t

		deny B.T.C. the consequential increase in charges.

	But in long run, we can’t go on like this.  Continuing spiral.



P.M.	x/ shd. be examined.	[Exit  A. &amp; A.V.A.



B.	R.E.C. are reluctant to increase fares.  Timber, steel, coal – prices go

		up with Cab. approval:  increases rlway costs.  But no sympathy

		fr. Govt. - &amp; no facilities to modernise their services.  B.T.C. are

		frustrated.

	Economy.  Steady pressure for it.  But managemt. can’t do it alone.

		Staff co-opn is just as important.  Integration of road/rail is

		held back by antipathies of men.  And Cab. have made it clear

		to me tht. one thing they won’t risk is transport strike.

	R.E.C. see no chance of paying their way w’out wholesale

		electrification.



A.B.	Our fault:  as good Socialists we shd. have prevented manufacture of

		lorries &amp; coaches.  Can’t afford a rlway system &amp; coaches.



H.D.	When we did this, we expected quick natn on roads with its profits

		to off-set losses on rail.



B.	Reason:  all area schemes stopped because Parly situation.  Can’t carry

		them.



T.W.	And any such scheme involvg. municipal transport wd. cause Labour 

		pol. diffies.



H.D.	Act contemplates transport wd. pay its way because road profits.  Act

		can’t be carried out on road side:  we shd. therefore announce

		we have abandoned aim of Act &amp; subsidise rail loss.



H.G.	No.  Rlways carrying much more than pre-war – not less.  But charges

		are v. low.  Fares only 55% above pre-war:  and freights only

		80%(?).  Error was in not raisg. charges during war.

	Argument: lose traffic because increased costs operates only at 	margin.



H.W.	Want more figures etc.  Tribunal was the mistake.



H.M.	Wd have bn. diff. to avoid Tribunal.  Also good Socialist principle tht.

		consumer shd. be heard on prices.

	And C. licences was Cabinet’s fault.  We gave way on this.

	And it was our fault tht. excessive nos. of lorries &amp; coaches were

		made.

	Only course now:  we are in a jam:  their fare proposals are excessive:

		their publication now wd. give us political diffies.  No increase 

		in fares, or only a modest one.

	Ministers are too gentle with Board Chairmen.  I wd. like to compel

		them to increased efficiency.  And if they get into trouble with

		unions…………



T.W.	We have covered all running deficit but £2 m. - £3 m.  Must we not

		enable B.T.C. to cover that.  And tell them their remaining

		£30 m. must come from economy.



A.B.	Mistake to put industry in surplus or too heavy a deficit.  A small

		deficit (£2-3 m.) will be best climate in which to drive for 

		greater efficiency.



B.	On what we decided 12 mos. ago, B.T.C. wd. have had balanced 

		budget.

	But circs. have changed – by increased wages &amp; costs (largely coal).

	Cab. discn really turns on their desire for £10 m. margin.

	The £40 m. must be liquidated by Govt. or be covered in charges 

		scheme.



E.B.	By efficiency you can’t get more than 2½% p.a.  You can’t expect

		them to achieve 10-12% in a year.

	In L.P.T.B. it took 6 years to work thro’ an efficiency scheme.

	Have we got right basis of calculation?  Is 55% over pre-war right.

		Fare-paying passenger/earning per car mile/cost of commodities

		carried.  What does 55% represent p. car. mile.

	Ty. shd. not be adamant v. any further grant on post-war settlement.

		We were never sure the £43 m. under Rlway Agreemt. wd. yield

		enough to put rlways on their feet post-war.



H.G.	Say to B.T.C.   {  costs have risen in Ldn. area by £3 m.

			       {  they got poor deal from Tribunal last time.

			       {  Say £4-5 m. instead of £10 m. or £12 m.



E.B.	Unless you clear their deficit, they will be back again.

	Moral oblign on Govt. because war-time settlement.



		M/T. and Ty. to put detailed proposals to Cab. on Monday.
