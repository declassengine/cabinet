C.M. 67(50)							            22nd October 1950



		1.	Mr. Gaitskell.			[Enter Att.G. &amp; Callaghan. W.W.



P.M.	Welcome to new Ch/Exch.





		2.	Germany: Re-armament.



E.B.	Alleged statement by Morgan Phillips.  Didn’t consult F.O.  Supposed to have said “Br. Govt”…..  Shall get in touch with him.  M’while shall stand on N. Yk. communiqué.   Hope other Ministers will do the same.

	Has upset France: U.S.

	Need for gt. care in speech makg. to avoid refce to this ques.





		3.	Palestine.



E.B.	Econ. and pol. sitn v. serious.  Black market: break in majority Party: no grip on econ. sitn.

	V. little response fr. U.S. on econ. and fin. aid. Wealthy U.S. Jews think Pal. Govt. is too far to Left: and middle section have lost influence in U.S. Trade Unions.



	Israel Govt. have allowed excessive immigrn – can’t absorb it – we told them so.

	Also Poles and E. Europ. are difft. kind of Jews: tough eggs.

	New Arab policy.  Iraq, eg. releasg. Jews too fast: makg. diffies for Israel.

	Loss of faith, in U.N., because Jews haven’t accepted internatn of Jerusalem.

	Has aroused powerful R.C. organn in U.S., anti Jewish lobby.

	Gives me anxiety re M/D. as a whole.  Our posn in Egypt uncertain – and E. pol. seem disturbed.  Rows in both places might disturb whole area.

	Warning to Cab.  No policy proposals.  F.O. considg. what we can do.





		4.	Russian Policy: Prague Declaration.



E.B.	Prague resolns.



	Prob. seekg. to influence France.  Frightened of re-armed Germany.  So am I.  But they brght it on, by arming E. Germ Police.

	Seekg. therefore to stop N.A.T.O. move.

	Also v. anxious to get 5 Power mtg. in being.  Either to delay us or to settle because they are frightened.  Which?

	Tried a rehearsal for coup in Austria.  Caccia’s analysis.

	It failed because Austr. resistance.  And Austria preparg. v. second attempt.

	R disturbed at Sov. citizens in from Curtain countries – and l/c there if trouble came.  Trying consolidated power there.  May try more transfers/popn.





	 	5.	United Nations: Secretary General.



G.W.	If R. produced reasonable name, we are commd to vote w’out adjournment.  And shd. have abstain.

	Diffies	a)  We shd. have time to consider wthr. we need abstain.

		b)  Surely R. entitled to consn of a reasonable name.



E.B.	Was told no adjournment wd. be allowed.  Not tht. we object to adjournment: just no opportunity.

	Never bn. advised tht. R. wd. put up reasonable name.  Tried to keep it open in case: but told as above.

	Then said: if no chance to consider during adjournment, only course is to abstain.  What other advice cd. I give?

	As protest v. refusal of adjournment.

	Don’t want Comm. candidate pushed in as manoeuvre.  Wd. prefer to go on voting for Lie.



P.M.	Jebb shd. fight for adjournment: but, if he can’t get it, abstain.





		6.	Japan: Peace Treaty.



E.B.	Shall have to face it.

	U.S. haven’t made up minds still.

	Important apprecn by Gascoigne.

	Urging Franks to make U.S. face it.



G.W.	Australia wd. take same attitude to re-armament of Japan as France are over Germany.

							         [Exit Callagan.



		7.	King’ Speech: Opening of Parliament.



H.M.	Shd. offices be included in Leasehold Bill?



C.E.	Wd. give credit to Tories if left to amendment.



H.D.	Mention shops and offices.



J.	Diff. basis for these.  “And will also introduce proposals for renewal of tenancies of certain business premises”.    Agreed:  shops and offices via business premises.



A.B.	Adminve paragraph.  V. weak formulation.  Prefer my own formula – housing will continue enjoy its high priority.

H.G.	No objn  re housing.  But care in referring this to social policy. l.a. are willing to accept housing.



H.D.	Put housing in separate sentence: commit ourselves to that.



H.G.	Yes: then let wording of para. as now stand unaltered.

	

	Employment Bill.



H.G.	Negative only – or positive – or both?



H.W.	Memo. recommend, positive powers awaits Cab. decision.



H.G.	Shall be asked to say in debate on Address.



	Approved: subject to amendmts.





		8.	Council of Europe.				[Enter Callagan



E.B.	Memo. speaks for itself.



H.D.	Endorse memo.  Have circulated Transp. House paper for background.

	On one hand vague urge for Federation.  Against it U.K., Scandinav. and Irish (of all parties).

	P.4.: 17 iii and iv.: no interference with Fed. ???? in limited circle by those who want it.

	Para. 19(2).  Full emplt.  Was main U.K. initiative at Strasbourg.

	We did well: good Cttee.  Hope E.B. will back this firmly.

	Has good propag. value. may help W. Germans: in line with our Br. initiative at E.C.O.S.O.C and I.L.O.

	Agree no Ministers shd. go in U.K. delegn in future.  Embarrassing for us.  No need for them now.  V. good Labour team this year – less Ministers and Mackay they wd. make a v. good lot.

	My only doubt on memo = suggn of includg. Non-Parliamentarians.

	Essence of Assembly was Parliamtrians.  Stick to them and pick them well.

	Discn in H/C. of Strasbourg results.  W.S.C. promised to find time in Supply Days.  Useful to have such a discn.  Can we have it – preferably in Oppn time.



H.M.	Don’t want to give a Govt. day.  Mustn’t imply tht. these ques. are subject to Parly ratification.



P.M.	Prefer to stick to Parliamentarians.



H.M.	Scientific co-opn is a practical propn.  And safe than social services. Glad E.B.’s memo. is a bit forthcomg. on co-opn.

	For eventually much to be said for Federation (!).

	Para. 19(3).  Assembly’s follies are embarrassg. to Govts.  Worth trying to prevent them.  Leads me to Ministerial participn.

	See disadvantage of that.  But remember we are coherent Govt. most others are Coalition.  Fear our Members may be seduced fr. their duty if Ministers aren’t there: our Tories may get them to support things Govt. wdn’t like.  Wd therefore prefer to keep this ques. open until nearer next mtg.

	Against incln of non Parliamentarians in delegn.



H.D.	Helpful if good F.O. official were there to advise delegn.



H.McN.	Endorse E.B.’s view – have always thght it wrong to associate Ministers with non-Governmental Assembly.

	Why extend specialised agencies technique to C/Europe?

	C/Europe won’t do more on full emplt. than E.C.O.S.O.C. Duplicn.



H.D.	Full emplt. wdn’t be matter for a specialised agency.



H.McN.	Even so, leave it to E.C.O.S.O.C.

	Scientific co-opn.  Already organisns for this.  Cdn’t we steer U.N.E.S.C.O. into it. 



G.T.	 Is doing so already.



H.McN.	Para. 13.  Study of constitutn.  Experts better than Ambassadors.

	Slippery slope.  Shall have pressure for amendmt to Federation.

	Better take line tht. it’s too soon to change constitn.



		Discn adjourned.			            [Exit W.W.





		9.	British Sugar Corporation.			[Enter M.W.



M.W.	Shareholders run no risk and shd. receive no profit.

	Para. 5.  Effective public control.  I don’t mean to imply tht. we shdn’t eventually take over private refineries.  I meant effective for immed. practical purposes.



P.M.	What wd. be relationship of corpn with Govt.?  May you not have less powers?



M.W.	No.  Every member of Bd. wd. be under Govt. control – at present some represent private firms and are obstructive.

	We are considerg. precise powers etc.  Shall have to define these in Bill.  Had wished to bring it into Dpt. but S.I.M. against that.  Need to know what powers are needed to give day to day control.

	Powers today are greater than under 1935 Act – and wd. revert to that when 1942 Act lapsed.



Att.G.	Powers needed exceed those over other Corpns.

H.G.	Subsidy – involves need for further powers than normal with public corpn.



A.B.	Leave this alone until full natn comes along.

	M/F. has v. extensive powers over existg. Corpn, as in memo.

	V. much more than we cd. easily take for a public corpn new style.

	Para.11 of Annex.  This will frighten sugar refiners and enrage our friends.

	Leave it alone.  Don’t be tactical.  Or go ahead and nationalise this monopoly.  This Bill wd. make our people think Lord Lyle has won.



H.M.	This means: if Parly situation doesn’t allow us to do all we promised, do nothing and renew Tory legn.

	If we renew, we leave these private interests protected from all risk.  It wd. be at least a move forward.



	Good sense to go as far as we can.  Wd. give us a beginning of a grip over Tate and Lyle.



	Only advantages	i)  may pay less.

				ii) gives some access to Tate and Lyle refining.



A.V.A.	That is domestic prodn only.  Real ques is refining imported sugar in off periods of beet factories.

	I argued for natn at Election time.  But this limited move wd. enrage our friends.  Better go for whole hog at appropriate time.  M’while renew existg. legn making it clear we don’t modify our policy attitude.



A.	What are we going to do in 1952?

	If we leave it alone now, we perpetuate wicked 1935 agreemt.

	People who wd. be enraged by this plan = Tate and Lyle (not Labour supporters) because it wd. give Govt. a hold over refining.

	My object is to undermine power of refiners over factories wh. have largely bn. built out of Govt. money.

	In principle, M/F. must be right.



H.G.	Sugar wdn’t have appeared in our p’mme if it hadn’t bn. for this point. For no Labour Govt. cd. ask Parlt. to renew 1935 agreement.  But most we cd. do now wd. be as in M/F. memo.

	I therefore support H.M.



P.M.	We are on strong ground because we must take some action.



H.D.	Competitive enterprise. We can here ruin Tate and Lyle by under-selling them.

	Lukewarm support for our sugar natn plan.



J.	Whole object of this is to get rid of refining agreemt. which is indefensible.  Make this the point of attack.

	But does this plan get rid of it?

H.W.	It may automatically lapse, as matter of law.  But, if it doesn’t Chairman will be stronger to negotiate if Govt. corpn.



Att.G.	If we find it doesn’t lapse, we shd. legislate to end it, not negotiate for it.



A.B.	Wd. that give rise to claim for compensn?



A.V.A.	Unwise, with present Parly majority, to raise for 1st time ques. of public corpn competing with private enterprise.



H.W.	Shd. take a/c of views of Chairman.  If he feels he wd. be on surer ground on this basis, we shd. go ahead.  Not otherwise.
