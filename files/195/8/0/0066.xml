C.M. 12(51).				8th February, 1951.



	1.	Parliament.                                            [Enter  K.Y., M.W., W.W.



H.M.	Congrats. to Whips on Divn on Steel Bill debate.



H.M.	Business for next week.

	Defence Debate:  to be on a Motion, approvg. terms of P.M.’s

announcemt.  Speakers:  M/D., Ch/Ex., M/Labour.  M/D. to open 1st day;  and Ch/Ex. to open 2nd day:  M/L. to reply to debate.



P.M.	White Paper on Defence.  Haven’t had enough time to consider it to

		get publn before the debate.  Is it really necessary to have it.



W.W.	Will suffice to leave it over until later.  Opposn warned.



E.Sh.	Not sure we can get a Wh. Paper bringing Estimates fully into line

		with new p’mme.  Probably a short Paper will suffice – giving

		M/D. Estimate &amp; referring briefly to Service Estimates.  Can

		settle final form after Defence Debate.



A.	Defence Debate 21/2.  F. Affairs Debate 28/2. – in H/Lords.

		To confirm with H/C. time-table.





	2.	Meat.



H.G.	Since last Cab. 2 talks – one with Dpts. concerned &amp; second with 

		Balfour.  At 1st mtg. decided to pay £120 – if reasonable condns

		re chilled &amp; deliveries.  50% overall of chilled in agreemt. 

		of 15 mos./to 30.6.52 – was understandg. previously – on

		that basis we wd. now pay £120.  Trouble now:  avoid higher

		price still because Press agitn weakeng. our bargaing. posn.

		Decided to send to Arg. Govt. a vague note indicatg. readiness

		to resume negotns (wh. technically are only suspended).

		Note delivered in Ldn. y’day.  M/F. will mention this in to-day’s

		debate.  A. expert, now in Switzerland, returning to Ldn. at 

		end/week.  Must await A.’s response.



M.W.	Believe I can satisfy H/C. reasonable opinion tht. we have a case.

		Past history (at length):  no. of detailed points:  ending with 

		indicn of fresh approach to A. Govt.

	If agreemt. reached we cd. dig into reserves – as soon as shipments are

		moving.



G.T.	What about high prices of fish &amp; rabbits.



M.W.	Considg. adding a passage re diffy of price control for those foods.



H.G.	Real answer to that:  are you ready to pay this higher price for meat,

		not for 6 wks., but for ever.



G.T.	Not a feasible political answer.



J.G.	Don’t say we can’t impose control on prices of alternatives.



A.B.	Don’t say anything to stress diffy of controls over prices.  This is what

		T.U.C. are most concerned about in genl. situation.  We have

		controlled fish prices before, with success.



H.M.	Say we won’t hesitate to apply control if public interest so requires.



H.G.	And say we are expectg. more fish when restns on trawling are

		removed.



E.Sh.	Can we promise higher ration of meat if we get early agreemt. with

		Argentine.



M.W.	Dare not.  Playing into hands of A. Govt.

			                                                         [Exit  M.W. and W.W.

			                                              [Enter  J.S., H., A. Crawley &amp;

				  Solr. Genl.

	3.	Call-up of Reservists. 



E.Sh.	a)	May be necessary to repeat this in 1952 - &amp; indeed up to 1954,

		which time supply of N.S. men will suffice.

		This applies to 15 day men only.

		The 3 months or 18 months men:  they are not to be called up

		again.



P.M.	V. diff. to convince H/C. tht. the same selected men shd. be called

		up again.



E.Sh.	May have to call up some of them again.



P.M.	They will think they are all liable.



J.S.	Avoid raising the point in the Bill:  leave it to be renewed for 

		another year by affirmative resoln?



P.M.	Can’t avoid making a clear statement of your intentions.

	Not practical politics to call on same men twice.



E.Sh.	Then take power to do it in subsequent years but say you won’t call

		same men twice.



A.B.	That destroys basis of selection.  We have said that this plan is to slot

		the men needed in the places in T.A. Divns. where they are 			needed.

 

P.M.	This year it is to fit up 4 T.A. Divns.  When you do it next year, will

		you move on to other Divns?  There are other T.A. Divns?



E.Sh.	Planning for another 8 Divns.



P.M.	Then they will be different men.  We can say they will be.



A.B.           x/	Then say:  it may be necessary to repeat this next year with diff. men

		and in diff. Divns.	Agreed.



P.M.	AA Command:  you want more key men.  But same principle must

		apply.



			Agreed:  take the powers:  statement as above.



A.C.	And exclude call-up of individuals in R.A.A.F.

			     fighter squadrons.



E.Sh.	b)	Medical Examination.  Before sending the men away.



A.B.	We agree.



E.Sh.	c)	Penalties:  no comment.



C.E.	Penalty for disregarding training notice:  is it enough?



J.	Consider in Legn Cttee.



H.M.	Incitement:  D.R. 39 A is pretty serious.



S.G.	Safeguard of search only on authority of High Ct. Judge.



J.	Let all these points be considered in Legn Cttee.



	d)	Protection for Employment.



A.B.	Don’t like this.  Up to now, employers have co-operated well.  If this

		is imposed by statute, employers will do only what they are 

		requd to do.  Will damage good atmosphere over T.A. training. 

		I must at least consult employers &amp; men.



E.Sh.	V. well:  if consultn can be done quickly.



J.S.	We think it wd. do more harm than good, qua T.A.



H.	We want safeguards on volunteers for 18 months.



A.B.	Better case for it there.



		Agreed:  Legn Cttee to clear up outstanding points.

	4.	Germany:  Re-armament.



K.Y.	Commd to principle:  not to timing.

	Discns at Bonn  a) mil. condns &amp; requiremts.

			       b) pol. condns required.

		No commitmt until Govt. have considered again.

		T. of r. (para. 12) suggest agreemt. on a) shd. be secured as soon

		as poss.  Not their fault if Cab. now think they’re going too fast.

		But no risk:  for i) Germans pressg. for (b) as condn ii) U.S. are

		relaxing some of their pressure.  Acheson at Brussels:  

		Eisenhower’s statement:  attitude of Germans also.

	Weekly rept. from I.K.  E.’s statement (no hurry for G. contribn)

		eagerly endorsed by many shades of G. opinion.  Any sense

		of urgency re re-armamt. has largely disappeared.

	In accord with Cab. decn of 14/12.

	Reasons for caution  i) didn’t want put G. into strong bargaining

		posn.  Now clear they will pitch their demands v. high.

			               ii) fear of quick R. re-action.  They refer to

		this in latest note as ‘intolerable’.

	Timing:  para. 6.

	Para. 4.  If C.F.M. broke down, that might be decisive moment 

		in R. eyes.

	W’out reversg. decisions taken since Sept. &amp; commd to Allies:

		only ques. now is wtr. we shd. suggest to U.S. or French 

		positive action to slow down these negotns.

	Pleven accepted (W’ton) principle &amp; made no condns re timing.

		Parodi deprecated early crystallisation:  U.S. thght. this 

		differed fr. Pleven &amp; didn’t like it.

	Para. 9.  After gettg. Acheson’s view, we might talk to French.



P.M.	I have always wanted this played slow.

	E.B. always wanted w. Eur. forces stronger first.

	U.S. pressed for more:  but they seem now less keen.

	Also bargaining counter in C.F.M.  I want honest attempt to seek

		a settlement.  If it’s true R. are really afraid of G. re-armament,

		we might get somethg. out of it.

	Don’t therefore emphasise G. re-armt as the essential.  It’s only one

		feature of bldg. Eur. defences.



K.Y.	U.S. view still linkg. G. re-armt tightly with strengthening of Eur.

		defence.

	In Pleven talks U.S. thght. R. concession wd. have to justify 

		slowing of Eur. def. as a whole – not takg. anything in return for 

		delaying G. re-arm. alone.



A.	Endorse P.M.’s view.



A.B.	This developmt. has incensed a good deal of sound opinion v. us.

		Eisenhower’s statemt. reflects views I have put.

	Proof tht. we shdn’t yield so quickly to U.S. pressure.  Keep friends

		with them, but don’t do their bidding f’with.

	Why frighten our people by going on with these talks with G.?  If, as

		E. now says, it will be so long before we are ready to absorb G.

		units.

	Don’t go back on principle:  but suspend the talks.



J.	Endorse P.M.



E.Sh.	Remember tht. when E.B. was in N. Yk., he referred it back to Cab.

		who accepted G. contn in principle.  That was starting-point. 

	Not true tht. U.S. then expected (even if Fr. agreemt. were secured)

		G. re-armamt. wd. take place under 2 yrs.  I used that in 

		argument v. France.  Can’t build Brigade Group fr. scratch in

		less than 2 yrs.  Thus, E. is not saying now anything diff. fr. what

		U.S. meant at outset in N. Yk.  Marshall’s 10 points:  not one 

		item re G. contn:  Moch accepted them.  They were

		confined to labour units etc.

	Later, at W’ton, U.S. had decided to go fwd. with G. contn.  They said

		either accept this principle &amp; seek to apply it in due course, or

		you won’t get any help fr. U.S.

	Decision to fight e. of Rhine was essential because attitude of Denmark

		&amp; Holland.  And decision in principle to re-arm G. followed 

		from that.

	Endorse P.M.’s view.  Delay conversations:  don’t break them off.

		And approach U.S. (para. 9) with v. gt. care &amp; tact.

		In the end we can’t defend Eur. w’out the Germans.

	Talks will be long:  for safeguards &amp; condns necessary.

	C.F.M.  There is militarism in E. Germany.  Is it to be matched by

		somethg. in W. Germany?  If not &amp; if we can’t reduce it in E.,

		what will happen?  Are we to fight it.  Or the Germans?

		It is not possible to root out G. militarism.  Be realistic.



H.D.	Welcome P.M. &amp; E.Sh.

	Cab. never favoured G. re-armament before E.B. went to N. York.

		E.B. said on arrival he was against it.  We agreed to the principle

		v. reluctantly ( after 3 mtgs) in deference to v. strong U.S.

		pressure.

	I wd. prefer to say we are against it.  Agree we can’t because U.S.

		views.  Say therefore we continue to accept principle, but delay

		it.  I hope principle will never be applied.

	Can’t hope to prevent worse Germans joining such a Force – or 

		emergence of Genl. Staff.

	Uneconomic for us now to give arms to Germans.  Give them to our

		friends first.

	Grim risk to push this fwd. in face of R. declaration.  In point of 

		time nonsense to say can’t defend Eur. w’out G. contn:  for we

		may provoke attack before G. contn can be ready.

	Proceed as in para. 9.



H.M.	We were not pushed into this by U.S.  I favoured it much earlier.

	Accept P.M.’s view.  But be careful to stick to one line.

	Don’t be pushed around on this, as result of impudent Comm.

		campaign.

	R. says you mustn’t arm G. – but all the time they are arming G.

	What shall we say in mtgs.  Can’t say accept principle but shan’t

		apply it.

	G. must have arms some day.  Bound to be slow, anyhow.

	Don’t give way to argument:  you mustn’t provoke R.  That was

		N.C.’s attitude to Hitler.

	Do a deal with R. if they are ready for it.

	But let’s hold opinion steady.  Say we favour it in principle:  don’t

		be afraid to say why.



H.G.	One of our diffies:  ‘twixt public &amp; private diplomacy.  Pity anything

		had to be discussed in public.

	Equally, unable to tell whole story to public.  Prs. we cd. now say

		more.

	Endorse Para. 9.

	Card at C.F.M.  What do we want to get out of Russians?

		Nothg. concrete in pp. save prs. Australian Treaty.

		My worry was lest we shd. get a bogus “settlement” thro’ C.F.M.



J.G.	Trouble is juxtaposition of events.

	How justify to our supporters U.S. release of Krupp?  Our people can’t

		understand we aren’t responsible with U.S. Govt. jointly.  And

		we have suffered fr. Germany (twice) as U.S. haven’t.



C.E.	Agree with J.G.  These things are bound up together in people’s minds.

	Can we be assured tht. no G. war criminals will be released in Br. Zone

		w’out concurrence of Cabinet.



A.B.	Will you say something re Krupp in Monday’s debate.



K.Y.	We were not consulted on merits of this case.

	Only consultn was:  if I revoke confiscn order, will it affect our joint

		operation of Law 27 re deconcentn of industry.  Answer given

		was:  no, neither one way nor another.

	Ques. of control over his industrial property is not affected by this.



P.M.	Get all available information and I will make statement on Monday.



H.McN.	Wd be v. helpful if P.M. cd., in consultn with U.S., say tht. in view of

		G.’s statemt. we are re-considg. whole sitn.



A.B.	Don’t throw away in advance our card for C.F.M.



K.Y.	Para. 9. prob. O.K.  Trouble will prob. be tht. U.S. won’t agree to

		play that card for de-militarisation of E. Germany only but

		only in return for a wider concession by R.



			                                         [Enter  G.S.  Exit  H. &amp; W.Str.

	5.	Sulphur.



H.M.	…….. Why appoint Knollys?

	D.S.I.R. etc., give this first priority.



H.W.	There is a report going to R. Materials Cttee.



A.	Deplore Knollys’ appointment.

	Sorry to see tht. industry isn’t going faster on pyrites.

	More energy shd. go into this.



H.W.	Sulphur is cheaper &amp; we’ve bn. trying to reduce costs.

	There may be shortage of pyrites.

	Better to rely on our own anhydrate - &amp; extraction as by-product.



A.B.	This is not due only to U.S. stock-piling.  It is due to extravagant

		waste of natural resources by capitalist U.S.

	Ministerial drive on Raw Materials.  Offl. Cttee is not enough.

                 x/	No adequate geo-physical survey made.  Vital now, here and in 

		Africa.



P.M.	Put in a memo. on x/:  &amp; we’ll have a full discussion.



G.T.	Deplorable effect on re-deploymt. of labour in Lancs.  Followg. U.S.

		demand for it – study groups etc.  Then it is U.S. which denies

		the raw materials.

			                                                   [Exit  G.S.  Enter  N.Edw.



	6.	Post Office Staff Associations.



N.E.	A new association of motor-drivers.  Recognition of it wd. weaken

		Cab. posn.  Tho’ it is isolated &amp; doesn’t spread over grades.

		Unions warn me tht. recognn will encourage break-aways.

	I propose an advisory Commn to examine staff assocn posn in G.P.O.

		with particular regard to breakaways &amp; advise both on genl.

		principle &amp; on current applns.

	Terrington, Miss Hancock &amp; Ralph Glyn.

	T.U.’s are in favour.



H.G.	i)	Ty. shd. see wording of t. of r.

	ii)	Nat. Staff Side shd. also be sounded informally as well as

			P.O.  T.U.’s.

	iii)	Shd. like time to think about membership:  effect on C. Service

			generally.



A.B.	Agree in principle:  I also shd. be consulted.



			Agreed in principle:  A.B. &amp; H.G. to be consulted

			                                   on details.
