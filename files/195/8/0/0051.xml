C.M. 83(50).				7th December, 1950.



	1.	Parliament.



H.M.	Business for next week.

	Coal (12/12):  on Motion by Opposn.  May be equivalent to vote

		of censure.

	Adjourn Friday, if poss.  Provn for re-call, as usual.

	Opposn expect statement by P.M. on his return &amp; debate 48 hrs. later.

		This might mean House sitting into followg. week.  Thursday

		booked for this – in case P.M. returns in time.

	W.S.C. thinks defence debate is overdue:  but has agreed to wait 

		until after Xmas.



A.	Civil Emplt. Bill.  What is compromise?



G.A.I.	Will tell you during day.



A.	F/Britain Bill comg. to us so late tht. we can’t take it before Xmas.

	Judges Bill.  Informed now tht. it isn’t so urgent.



J.	Two Judges who want to retire at Xmas.  Can meet it by a retrosp.

		amendmt. applying it to those who were Judges at date of introdn

		of Bill.



H.M.	Better method wd. be to push Bill thro’ as it stands before Xmas.





	2.	Leasehold Bill.



A.B.	Won’t get thro’ now until end/February.  M’while courts are evicting

		people.  Do Judges take a/c of legn wh. is passing thro’ Parlt.?

		Can I exercise requisitioning powers to frustrate decision of

		courts?  Not only ground leases, but Crown property on 

		v. restve cases.



J.	Courts can’t officially take note of pending legn.  But, where they

		have a discretion, they will normally exercise it.



H.M.	Let M/H. discuss with J. &amp; Att.G. &amp; see wtr. anything can be done.

			                                          {Exit  Dep. Ch.Whip.

			                                          {Enter  Parly Secy. M/Pensions



	3.	Balance of Civil Pay.



H.G.	On balance, I favour changing now what has bn. practice in last

		3 wars.  Diff. to justify discriminatg. thus in favour of public

		servants, now that Service pay is higher:  but War Service Grants

		shd. then be adjusted to cover middle class incomes.  Want to

		discuss with C. Service T.U.’s.



M/P.	Single men with dependants shd. not be pegged down to N.A.B.

		standards under W. Service Grants.



Att.G.	Shd. have to go into whole system of W. Service Grants.



E.Sh.	Arguments being evenly balanced, better to retain status quo.

		That is view of Service Dpts.

		Reasons:

		i)	Departure fr. practice of last 3 wars.  People are used to it.

			No adminve diffy – whereas W. Service Grants wd.

		ii)	Might have detrimental effect on recruitment for 

			auxiliary Services. i.e. T.A. &amp; womens’ Services.

		iii)	Not much money to be saved by change.

		iv)	W. Service grants means a means test.  Wd. cause trouble.

	Now considering call-up of Z reservists for annual training.  They

		won’t like it.  They wd. like it less if they didn’t get balance of

		civil pay.

	W. Service grants system wd. give rise to hosts of P.Q.’s etc.

		Maximum of £10 wdn’t cover all cases.  And many employers

		wd. make up pay above that maximum.  Are Govt. to be less

		generous than private employers?



G.A.I.	Support M/Defence case.

	Follow good employer in this – as we did recently over paid leave.

		Gave list of large firms who do make up balance of civil pay.

	Means test is v. dangerous.



A.B.	I was first to raise this ques.  M/D. &amp; M/L. haven’t really gone into

		this.  The firms quoted by M/L. are monopolies – and can be

		generous to employers at consumers’ expense.

	What of Health Service (400.000):  socialised industries (incldg.

		miners).  Enclave of privileged persons – civil servants and

		employees of monopolies.  Must now be all or none.  What

		compensn will you give to person directed to civil emplt. at

		lower wages.

	On W. Service Grants – must have principles clearly established.

		Must not have a wide adminve discretion because risk of abuse.

	Service pay is now attractive.



H.M.	In Local Govt. in 1939 I resented Govt. decision.



C.E.	Serious trouble with Police if Ty. proposal goes thro’.

	May not answer be tht. Service pay is now so high tht. v. small nos.

		wd. have to receive balance of civil pay if existg. system were

		maintained.



			Discussion adjourned.  M/Defence to put memo. in.



	

 

4.	Future of Ground Nuts Scheme.	[Exit  M/P  Enter M.W.



M.W.	Bd.’s report faces us with failure.  It has cost us £35 m. to 

		establish tht. groundnuts can’t be grown on large scale methods.

	My first inclinn was to pull out.  But large amount of fixed assets:

		&amp; experience in tropical agriculture.  Discussed therefore with

		C.O. means of makg. some positive use of these.  Hence this 

		plan for 7 years of experimental mixed farming.



J.G.	Arguments are in memo.

	Choice now:  abandon scheme or convert it into Col. Dev.

		scheme.  I am sure 2nd course is right, for reasons in paras 21-23.

		First course wd. be serious blow, both in Colonies, &amp; in world

		at large.

	Alarmed at growth of popn.  We are saving lives far faster than we

		can feed mouths.  We must increase food production.  Someone

		had to try this:  we did.

	Must come over to C.O.  Wd. not put it to C. Dev. Corpn – they have 

		enough to do with 50 projects they have in hand.  They must also

		go in for devolution.  Maybe regional devolution will be best.

	M’while keep O.F.C. with addn of repves of Tanganyika Govt. &amp;

		C. Dev. Corpn.

	Legn will be involved.  My recommn is in para. 28 – give O.F.C. power

		to initiate similar schemes.

	Must have guarantee for 7 years.  In no shorter time can we be sure

		tht. limited scheme can succeed.

	Before abandoning it – if Cab. so inclined – Govr./Tanganyika shd.

		have opportunity to come over &amp; put his views.



H.G.	There will be major row over the past.

	Ques. now:  is what we do in future.  Separate pol. consns &amp; merits.

		My first preference is to make clean slate &amp; wind it all up.

		From our point of view we wd. lose little.

		If we go on, no assurance tht. we shan’t lose a lot more money.

		That’s why C.O. want it on their Vote, not with Col. Dev. Corpn.

		Personnel as well as money.  S.E.A. plan is threatened for lack of

		experts.  If we closed this down, much of the skill &amp; equipmt. cd.

		go over to S.E.A. plan.  Where is best place in “under-developed”

		project to use these resources.

	There wd. be a tailing off anyway.  But a 7 year guarantee is v. much 

		the other way.

	No estimate of prob. loss.



J.G.	We believe a good chance of growing some food.  And chance of

		proving it w’in 7 years.

	First ques:  shall we go on with clearing of 40.000 acres in S. Province.

		We say – yes.  And consider future clearing policy – 15.000 a

		year for 3 yrs. – then review again:  i.e. two reviews.





H.M.	Proper way to ascertain what you can grow in Tanganyika is, not

		large-scale, but small pilot experiment.

	S.E.A. will need technicians.  For same purpose of increasing food

		supplies.



T.W.	By scientific means you can’t prove right forms of cultivation etc.,

		in less than 7 years.  Wtr. area is small or large you can only 

		prove this in time by practical experience.



A.	Agree re period.  But doesn’t affect scale.

		One experiment wdn’t suffice – for diff. areas etc., &amp; condns.

		Must have several.  Needn’t be large.

	Give 7 yr. guarantee over a limited field.



H.D.	Queensland is a success.  Why make any change in it?



J.G.	Because you can’t have a C.O. scheme in Australia.



M.W.	The same people will run it.



H.M.	Make it accountable to C.R.O. vice C.O.?



G.W.	We don’t know views of Queensland Govt. anyway.  We shd. have 

		alternative plan.  We shd. keep our foot in on it.  Trying to work

		out a way of preserving U.K. interest.



A.B.	Africa.  i)	Can’t you isolate cost of social equipment e.g. ports etc.

		   ii)	What size scheme wd. be requd to warrant keeping on the

			      social overheads, hospitals etc.



J.G.	O.F.C. recommn is status quo for 7 years in 2 n. areas.  In the South

		40.000 more + 15.000 p.a. for 3 years;  then it will be economic 

		unit.



A.B.	That is only conjecture!

	What I shd. prefer is to say:  this is an experiment, its size is what

		is requd if we are not to throw away social equipmt. already

		invested.



M.W.	The size is determined under this plan by the amount of land

		cleared or to be cleared.



H.G.	I must have some more assurance of financial liabilities involved.



			Agreed:  Ch/Exch. to go into that, with C.O. and M/Food.

			               (+ Coates &amp; Govr. of Tanganyika.)



M.W.	Promised to try to present Wh. Paper before Recess.



H.D.	Let them wait for that.

			Agreed:  Discuss Queensland separately, if we can, while

			               P.M. Queensland is here.

			               No decn w’out further ref. to Cabinet.



	5.	Meat.



H.G.	Price of the U.S. meat is £300 p. ton.  And wdn’t be available until

		end Jan.  We have decided not to go on with it.

			General approval.



M.W.	Argentine talks aren’t going v. well.



					[Enter  E.S.

	6.	Marketing of Fruit &amp; Vegetables.



H.D.	As in memo.



H.G.	Haven’t evaluated financial risks.  Don’t therefore be committed in

		principle before we talk.

	Want to consider form of “public co.” further.



A.	Talked about for 30 years.  This is first practical plan – and it’s

		v. modest.



E.S.	Shd. have 6 or 7 to make experiment worth while.



H.M.	Shd. be made clear tht. it is experiment.

		Don’t want an internal ground-nuts scheme.

			Memo. approved.	     [Exit  M.W.

				     [Enter  N.B., G.S., B.



	7.	Coal.



	(a)	Open-cast.



N.B.	Might yield 250.000 t. this year.

	Hope M/A. &amp; M/T.C.P. will clear these sites as quickly as poss.



H.D.	30 outstanding:  10 requd.  Will try for marginal cases.



T.W.	I agree.  Will co-operate on that basis.



H.G.	Offl. Cttee shd. report further on p’mme.



	(b)	International consultn.



N.B.	Shd. we tell E.C.E. tht. exports next year can’t be assumed to be more

		than 7 m. tons.  Or at least warn them tht. we shan’t in April

		switch back to full figure of 1950.



H.G.	Don’t mention a figure.  Give genl. warning only.

	Europe will take it hard:  &amp; will ask wtr. we are restrictg. our

		consumptns enough.  We must discuss that because we are 

		doing same on r. mats.

	Shop-lighting.  See if coal shortage causes real suffering in Europe:

		if it will, we shall have to cut our lighting.  Must get fair

		shares internationally on raw materials.



N.B.	Ready to consider internationally.



H.M.	Shall prob. have to cut shop-lighting after Xmas.



A.B.	Must we sign away our sovereignty – and advertise failure of 

		coal natn.



H.W.	We don’t expect suppliers to make same cuts as importers.  Never

		asked Sweden to cut their consumptn of timber in order to give

		us what we need.



H.G.	We want to take somethg. like this line with U.S.



E.B.	If G. steel goes to 13 m., Europe will be shorter of coal:  and we shall

		feel results.



			Agreed:  no decision on shop-lighting until after Xmas.



G.W.	Coal Cttee of E.C.E. are considerg. allocn scheme.  We might be 

		involved in breach/contract with Eire.



H.G.	Not a strict allocn scheme.



	(c)	Supplementary Pensions.



N.B.	As before.



H.M.	To be effective for purpose in mind, this must be limited to miners.

	Genl. discn with T.U.’s.  Some want each discussed on merits.

		Others say if done for some must go for all.

		Can’t believe T.U.’s wd. agree to have a scheme for miners only.

	Socd indies trying to get on their feet – this wd. add much to their

		burdens.



T.W.	No hope of holding man-power in mines, with full emplt., unless

		somethg. like this is done.

	Agree – no use if all other socd indies follow suit.

	Men wdn’t be leavg. mines if it were true tht. miners are getting

		excessive rewards.



J.G.	Miners now have big bargaining power.  Comms wd. use it.  The

		Labour men say tht. they must have a means of getting in first		to preserve their hold over the men.

	Advantage of scheme – not limited to giving it to miners alone.

		For main purpose wd. be to hold men of over 40.

	Doubtful if it’s wise to promise in principle.  For scheme when

		worked out, might be financially unattractive.  Wd. rather see

		scheme first.  Worst of both worlds to offer a scheme the men 		wdn’t appreciate.



E.S.	Hope no immed. decn will be taken.

	Cttee was to examine whole field.

	May soon have to review age structure of our whole pensions system.	We can’t make sense if we yield to pressure of particular industry.

	It’s comparatively young men who are going – pensions doesn’t 

		hold them.

	You cd. not limit this to miners.  No chance of denying it to iron &amp;

		steel for example.  Loses advantage to mining.

	Prices bound to rise in consequence.

	Don’t therefore do this in a panic:  mark time pro tem.



G.A.I.	Scheme for miners will be followed by demands fr. other indies.

	But miners know tht. N.C.B. are willing to discuss it &amp; are held back		by Govt.

	Don’t know answer to this ques.  Let us therefore know what it

		might cost.  And what advantage it wd. have for individual.



A.B.	Mtg. of miner members of Cab. – felt tht. pensions scheme wd. be 

		most attractive measure for holding mining man power.

	Repercussions.  Tell other indies they depend on coal.  That their

		members can go into mines if they want suppl. pensions.

		Let’s see how individual workers behave, with a pensions

		scheme.

	Next demand will be tht. suppl. pensions be made mobile.

		That = addn to general pensions.

		And makes it imposs. to use suppl. pensions as incentive to

		man-up undermanned industries.

	Fact is, you can’t hold miners under full emplt. condns w’out special		inducements.

	Real problem = consciousness of lack of status of miners.

		Tendency to be a class of sub-standard humans – whom girls

		don’t want to marry.  Pension will help to give status.

	If we are to do this, we must do it quickly.  Don’t let’s have to concede

		it to Homer &amp; Moffat.

	A social necessity – (prs) Ty. shd. pay.



B.	No arrangemt. with T.U.C. wd. prevent transport workers from 

		pressing for same concession.

	If this is given, Cab. must understand that.



H.G.	I believe A.B.’s case is unanswerable, in principle.  Tho’ I have 

		h’to said stand-still.

	Costs in mining will have to rise if man power is to be kept.

	Don’t believe you can confirm this to miners.  Decn will be to lift

		Govt. ban on negotn.  Try to hold it for a time.  But you can’t

		hold it for long.  Esp. as in gas &amp; electricity many of old workers		have pension rights.

	My concln:  this is the lesser risk.

	Even if gas &amp; electricity get it, don’t think that will destroy all value

		of concession to miners.



C.E.	Make it a harsh scheme.  No mobility.

	Agree:  status of miner has dropped.



N.B.	Even in U.S. there is a scheme of pensions for miners.

	N.C.B. can’t produce a firm plan w’out consultn with N.U.M.

		But for 1/= a ton they believe they can get attractive scheme.



E.B.	Flat rate scheme won’t work now.  Must have somethg. proportionate

		to earnings.

	Need it cost 1/= a ton.  Always some saving to be made.

		cf. I.C.I. scheme, where a man cd. buy units of pension insurce &amp;

		their turn-over of labour dropped fr. 30% to 4%.

	Do we know enough about turn-over.

	Think there must be a scheme.  But we mustn’t rush it.

		Only chance of quick action wd. be an improvised scheme.



G.T.	Favour units system.  Minimum, wh. follows you round:  and

		individuals buying units in addn.  Then it wdn’t have to be

		limited to miners.



			Agreed:  H.G., M/N.I., M/F &amp; P., M/L &amp; prs. a miner

			               Member of Cab. shd. now see T.U.C. &amp; try

			               to get their support for an approach on these lines.

				           Pakenham.

	8.	Durham County Council.



A.B.	Ready to meet repves of Council.  Wd. leave M/Ed. out because his

		powers are specific.  And we want to keep discn general.



G.A.I.	Agreed.





	

 

	9.	Emergencies.



	a)	B.O.A.C.



Att.G.	B.O.A.C. – semi-official.  V. tidy case of (unofficial) illegal strike

		instigated by Communists.  Tho’ M/L. has mucked it up in

		reply to Suppl. Ques.

	May be settled before Monday.  If not, I shall prosecute.



G.A.I.	Arbitn rights refused on non-unionist ques. – in principle.

	Employer shd. proceed for breach/contract.  Heavy loss.



P.	B.O.A.C. will do so – unless back by Monday.  I wd. support that.



G.A.I.	Don’t take procdgs. (criminal) where men refuse to work with

		non-Unionists.  Remember this was basis of strike.



Att.G.	I can’t take any a/c of that considn.



J.	He can’t.



Att.G.	I can’t delay crim. procdgs. now.  Wd. have bn. O.K. if B.O.A.C. had

		taken civil procdgs. 3 wks. ago.  Too late now to leave it to civil.



J.G.	If 1305 is used to interfere in matter where workers’ feelings are

		aroused, 1305 will be swept away.  Att.G. shd. bear this in mind.



H.M.	Wd. prefer civil procdgs.



G.A.I.	Last prosecution has left a trail of trouble.



E.B.	If civil procdgs. are going to be taken, I wd. think that enough.

		Breach of contract is better way.



Att.G.	I will consult B.O.A.C. on wh. is better method.





	b)	Duple Motor Bodies Ltd.



Att.G.	Offl. – illegal because not notified to M/L.

	Was subject of P.Q.

	Strikers:



G.A.I.	Have bn. notified by employers &amp; have referred it to arbitn.



			Agreed:  Consider on Monday.  Memo. on facts by M/L.
