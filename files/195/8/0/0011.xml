C.M. 37(50)							19th June 1950



		1.	Malaya and Singapore.			[J.S. and K.Y.



P.M.	V. valuable report – and good thing both Ministers went.



J.G.	First visit by Col. Secy.  Welcomed on all sides.

	Valued 2 mtgs. with M.M. – includg. one with C.O.S. present, attended by J.S.

	

	Military situation: bandits had bn. chased out of one area into another.

	Briggs’ plan therefore based on civil consolidn behind mily advance.

	Begun on 1/6 in Jahore.  By end/Nov. expects to clear that and adjacent State.  For further success, re-inforcemts are essential – see paras. 2.6 and 11 of memo. – i) Police, officers and n.c.o.’s.  H.O. have promised to help: won’t be easy: if we can’t get all here, prs. we might get some fr. Australia. 



P.M. 	Retired Indian Police ?  



J.G. 	Some diffies fr. re-inforcing from Pal. Police earlier.  Wd. be easier for Malayan Police if re-inforcemts. came fr. H.K. Police.  Wd. like to try that source first. Jungle squads – 45 cos. planned.  To keep cleared area clean of bandits.  For these we need n.c.o. from Army.  Callg. for N.S. men to volunteer for continued service in that capacity.  Asian officers needed also – Police College to meet that need.



	ii)  Adminve Re-inforcement.  Many men are tired – many are people who were captives in Jap. hands during war.



	iii)  Repatn of Chinese.  This was done formerly and was determent. Since Sept., new Comm. Govt., this has had to be stopped.  Detentn camps are unsatisfactory – mass escape wd. be possible.  10.000 already and nos. will rise as Briggs’ Plan succeeds.  Problems and dangers will increase.  Fully discussed.  Arranged tht. 200 shd. leave on 5/7 for Swatow: master was willing, but ship has m’while bn. lost.  M.M. is considerg. removal of some to Christmas Island – if Australian co. with concession then wd. agree.



	iv)  Propaganda.  Will report in detail to Malaya Cttee.  Much scope for improvemt.



	v)  Finance and Economics.  M.M. is preparg. apprecn of econ. sitn of Fedn by reason of emergency.  Clear tht. U.K. will have to give more help.  Will discuss with R.S.C. when apprecn is available.

	Told local Govt. they must increase their revenue, prob. by increased export tax on rubber and tin – from 20% to 30% or even 40%.



R.S.C.	That wd. mean paying tax in dollars and reducg. our dollar market.



J.G.	Alternative = income tax and they can’t administer that.

	The export tax is there now.



R.S.C.	But it hits us.  And might make U.S. go over to synthetic rubber.



J.G.	Contacts with T.U.’s.  The T.U. adviser in Malaya is doing v. good work.

	Want to give T.U.’s a boost – as only direct contact with masses.

	They asked me tht. Fred Dalley shd. go out for 6 or 12 months to help them.

	Hope to persuade him to do so.

	Europeans pressed for assurance we wdn’t leave Malaya for 20/25 years.



	I declined to go beyond P.M.’s statement.

	Raised ques. with M.M. – who believed, with Govrs. and officers, tht. it wd. take 25 yrs. to train Malayans for self-govt. : but he now thinks tht. S.E.A. political climate has changed and we shan’t be given 25 years.  My view is tht. pressure for constitutional change will come after emergency is over.  Plans shd. therefore be made now – or we may lose initiative.  Social plans, apparently, as well as constitutional – develop social services and road development and rural standards of life.  W’out added fin. assistce, Fedn won’t have resources to go ahead with these plans as well as paying for emergency.



J.S.	These points to add:-



	i)  Support plan for Police and adminve re-inforcemt. Paras. 6-11. Otherwise, all Army’s work will be lost.

	Needs as now establd are reasonable and based on full appreciation.

	Army morale, now good, will suffer if areas pacified by them ship back into anarchy.



	ii)  Repatn of Chinese.  Must decant them somewhere.  But to China – only after careful screening; for to send back member of Comm. Party wd. mean only giving him a refresher course - getting him back in worse form.  Send only suspects who aren’t politically dangerous.



	Powers of detn need strengthening.  Release on recommn of advisory Cttee is weakening posn of Army and Police.



	iii)  Informn Services.  Key appointment.  Political warfare.  Well-trained political mind – man trained in Labour movement.

	Many of officials are v. naïve about all this.  Someone who can combine severity in repressing emergency with far sighted apprecn of need to come to terms with growing nationalist movemt.  Also appreciate T.U. movement.  Brazier gets support fr. Govt. but bitter opposn fr. Employees, both British and Chinese.



P.M.	Disturbing thing is late stage at wh. civil Govt. work up to need for Briggs plan of consolidn behind Mil. advance.



	Questions    i) why do they prefer police fr. U.K. rather than ex. Indian Police, who understand Asiatics.



J.G.	Re-inforcemt. fr. Palestine Police 2 yrs. ago. upset Malayan Police – many of whom were displaced.  They don’t want that to happen again.



A.V.A.	People with Asiatic background wd. fit in easier.



J.S.	Malayan Police are jealous of new-comers arriving.

	There will be some row even over introdn of U.K. re-inforcements.



P.M.	Can’t bow to inefficiency of Malayan Force.



C.E.	Maxwell’s report was devastatg. qua efficiency.  Force is in rotten state.

	Drastic steps needed – fresh blood essential for that.

	We have no surplus in U.K.  And won’t be easy to get men to go out.

	Espec. as they can’t take families out.  Also recruitment for Pal. and Germ. Police Forces isn’t encouraging.  They will be sceptical v. continuing emplt.  Am willing, however, to try.  Will put national need to a conference of Ch.C.’s and urge them to call for volunteers.  Shall get some but not v. many.  No power to second men.  And Police Council wd. oppose legn giving such powers.  Might persuade individual Police authy to make arrangemts. facilitatg. departure of volunteers – and cd. show a good example qua Met. Police.



G.W.	Some good Indian Police must still be available – M/L. shd. know.

	Must be some U.K. police coming free fr. German Force.



C.E.	They are v. disgruntled.  Dangerous to send them out.



G.W.	Will ascertain facts, with M/L. re Indian Police.



G.A.I.	Must be army ex. officers on my Register.



R.S.C.	What type of men for adminve re-inforcemt?



J.G.	Col. Service probationers.  We are handling that.



E.Sh.	Of course emergency must be brought under control.

	But this country won’t be put on its feet by re-inforcemts. of police etc.

	What is record of local Govt.?  First phase: complacency and over-confidence.  Second phase: before arrival of our Ministers, mil. demands for re-inforcemts. of all sorts wh. under x-examinn turned into need for stronger civil administration.  Viz., at first, local Govt. were confident they cd. handle it on their own: then, they panicked for much more help then we cd. possibly give.

	“Build up T.U. movement.”  Why?  Because social and industrial condns are v. unsatisfactory.  Chairman of one of big tin cos. (paying 60%) has said tht. trouble with workers of Malaya is tht. they had no sense of social order.  The Employers are intensely re-actionary.

	By T.U. movement we may off-set effects of Comms.  There are only 4.000 of them: they cdn’t have succeeded so far unless condns had bn. so unsatisfactory.

	This needs careful and prolonged study.  ? in Malaya Cttee.

	I suspect tht. a more positive policy is more important than re-inforcemts.



	Amnesty?



J.G.	Leading Chinaman in Malaya had informn tht. most bandits wd. be ready to throw their hand in on basis of amnesty.  But I’m, sure tht. this, now, wd. be regarded as defeat for U.K.  Captured document shows bandits are discouraged because thght they cd. beat U.K. troops as easily as Japs did – in 80 days.  We must go on a reverse effect of our rout before Japs.  Otherwise our prestige will not recover.

	Don’t close my mind to it for future.  If Briggs plan succeeds. in clearing Jahore and neighbourg. State, we shall go on to Pehang.  That is where Comms. are strongest.  If we cd. defeat them there, amnesty might be worth while.  To offer it now cd. be read as sign of weakness.



P.M.	Genl. financial position? Do local people still dislike Ldn. cos?



R.S.C.	Posn  has changed.  It’s small men who have done well lately, not big estate co.  Now they are v. prosperous because of high price of tin and rubber.

	But they have had to spend a lot on war damage: bandits.

	We must give them more help, but  on condn  i) tht. they reform own taxn system and  ii) contribute to policy of social improvemt.

	Ready to say at once tht. in principle we will help.  But we must make this the occasion for a clear understanding of what future policy shd be.



A.B.	Hope apprecn will cover economic problem – excessive dependence on rubber and tin.



J.S.	A capitalist society, doubtless, for many years to come.  But it must be an up to date one.  There must be some substantial re-distribn of income.

	Civil Service still see their duty as one of securing maximum output of tin and rubber at cheaper prices.



P.M.	Parliamentary statements.  Shd. be one only – Wedy is most suitable day – by J.G., referring en passant to J.S.



J.S.	I was told by H.M. tht. he wanted me to make a statement. 

And I have now promised it, in reply to P.Q.

R.S.C.	Awkward for J.S. to draw back.



J.G.	Will p’pone mine until Wednesday.



P.M.	Let J.S. statement be more brief and follow on same day.  As an addendum – followg. up at once.	Agreed.



R.S.C.	Wd. like to consult re method of mentiong. financial assistance –

	perhaps suggesting somethg. about condns we shall impose.

	I will send over a re-draft.

							               [Exit J.S.



		2.	Coloured People from Colonies.



J.G.	Crowded colonies of these people in 4 or 5 areas.  Provokes fear of coloured ghettos.

	Prime need is to disperse.  Avoid creation of large communities.

	M/L. are doing their best.  Some employers and T.U.’s make diffies over emplt. of coloured people.

	Diff. to integrate them into community.  Want Govt. Dpts. and vol. agencies to come together over this.  Decided to convene a Confce for this purpose on 10/7. in hope of permanent national advisory cttee. These problems are serious enough to warrant that.

	Stowaways – fr. W. Indies and W. Africa.  Continuing. Ship arriving B’tol tomorrow with at least 14 stowaways on board.



J.	Amend law to empower you to send anyone back who arrives as

                   x/	stowaway wthr B. subject or not.



A.B.	Prefer tht. C.O. shd. ascertain what Col. Govt. do to verify no stowaways on board.



J.	Done by collusion with members of crew.



P.M.	Let L.O.’s consider x/.  The whole of the growing surplus of W. Indian

                  y/	populn can’t be discharged into U.K.  On basis of H.O. and M/T. advice.



G.A.I.	My diffies i) getting employers to accept them  ii) objns by individual employee.   Avoiding aggregation.  



P.M. 	Want genl. ques. examined, in light of y/.





		3.	European Payments Union.



R.S.C.	H.G. has done a v. good job on this.  As Chairman, second agreemt. on all major points.

	Hope we may now get full agreemt. by end/week.



		4.	Anglo-Canadian Continuing Committee.



R.S.C.	Canadians have nothg. specific to discuss.

	But we may have to give something by way of increased imports into U.K.





		5.	Lord Addison : 81st Birthday.



P.M.	Telegram to L.P.S. on his 81st b-day – from Cabinet.





		4.	Anglo-Canadian Continuing Committee (continued:).



A.B.		Hard wood.



R.S.C.		Howe has done excellent job.  Has got rid of “have regard” Clause.
