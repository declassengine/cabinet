C.M. 16(51).				1st March, 1951.



	1.	Parliament.                                             [Enter  W.W., K.Y. &amp; H.



H.M.	Business for next week.



P.M.	Thursday:  Navy Estimates.  Motion on Fechteler.  E.Sh. will have

		to speak.





	2.	N.A.T.O. Commands.



H.	Proposed tht. I shd. make statement in H/L. debate to-day (f. affairs) – 

		after Templewood’s opening speech.



A.	T. will ask for White Papers on i) duties of Supreme Commr.

		ii) 38th Parallel.



P.M.	Promise i) when settled.  Not yet decided.



A.	ii) can be rejected as unnecessary.



E.Sh.	Urging U.S. to decide allocn of other Commands esp. in Atlantic

		&amp; Med.

		Doubt if we can get decn before Thursd.

		Will press Eisenhower to move on.



P.M.	F. shdn’t have bn. publd in advance:  leaked in Denmark.

	Can’t therefore show a reasonable balance.



E.B.	Mil. pressure (in U.K.) for U.S. Commrs. – for some months past.



E.Sh.	Principle of U.S. Naval Commr. for Atlantic (w’out names) was 

		settled in A.V.A.’s day:  &amp; went thro’ at Brussels mtg. (w’out 

		our noticing it.



P.M.	C.O.S. all in favour.  Decided in principle in 1948.



E.Sh.	Approved by last Brussels mtg.  But neither E.B. nor I spotted it. 

		Accepted as “agreed reports” betwn. Govts.



H.	C.O.S. recommn in 1948.  Before N.A.T.O. establd.  Confirmed in

		1949;  and again in 1950 – in both Council &amp; Def. Cttee of

		N.A.T.O.  I first heard of it when leak occurred &amp; was told tht.

		P.M. &amp; E.B. had agreed &amp; approved.

	The Sea Lords support it.



A.B.	Not concerned with their views:  this is political.

	Shdn’t certain subjects be reserved in N.A.T.O. for Ministers.



E.B.	I shd. probably have made a report on Brussels – as W. Paper or as 

		report to Cabinet.

	I think tht. even now I shd. present a considered rept. on Brussels

		putting this ques. into perspective.



P.M.	This wd. help – to inform our own minds.



H.M.	With a diagram showing chain of command.



E.Sh.	May not be able to do that.



H.McN.	a)	issues involvg. pol. considns shd. come to Ministers.

	b)	care in presenting such decisions to U.K. public opinion.



E.B.	Diff. to decide what is political &amp; what is technical, esp. in these

		international affairs.

	Need for closer collaboration betwn. military &amp; political.  Can there

		be a guide to this – to ensure mil. don’t forget to bring these 

		things to notice.



A.B.	M’while H. shd. take line in H/L. tht. judgmt. shd. be suspended

		until whole Command picture is seen.



P.M.	P’pone Navy Estimates?  To give further time.



H.M.	Ch. Whip shd. consider later.  That wd. inconvenience W.O.

	Ask W.S.C. to raise command issue on (?) Civil Vote on A/C.



			Agreed.  H.M. to talk to A.E.





	3.	Reserve Forces Bill.	             [Exit  H.



E.Sh.	Objns in H/C. to Cl. 6.  Penalties excessive:  offence too wide:

		encroached on free speech.

	Promised consn.  Discussed with Service Ministers.  Proposed now to

		w’draw this sub-section and to substitute another (as described).

		This wd. apply only to persons actually selected for call-up, not

		to all “liable” to call-up.

	Snag (Att.G.):  liability to call-up “until emergency is at an end.”  If

		you don’t extend this to all “liable” it may imply you have no 

		power to call up anyone.



J.	Act of 1934 applies to “H.M. Forces”.  The offence thereunder is in

		much the same terms as here proposed.  If new clause, limited

		to persons served with notice:  what is posn of those not so

		covered?  Do they come under Act of ’34.  This clause wd. 

		create legal doubt.  Att.G. wondered wtr. clause shd. do no more

		than declare ’34 Act applies.  That wd. be politically weak,

		however.

H.M.	If we don’t need the clause:  can’t we say tht. this is because we have 

		now decided to limit offence to persons on whom notices have

		bn. served.



			Discussion adjourned.

			                                                  [Enter  C.O.S. &amp; 	Ogmore.

			                                                  [Exit  W.W., A.H.

	4.	Pacific Defence.



P.M.	Our objns to “island chain” conceptn convinced Dulles.  Now on basis

		of tri-partite guarantee.

	Recommend acceptance, tho’ U.K. not included.  Prefer tht. 

		Philippines shd. not be included.



C.I.G.S.	Our interest:  get A. &amp; N.Z. into M/E.  This Treaty helps qua 

		re-assuring them re own security.  Don’t mind U.K. being 

		excluded.  Want to exclude Phil.



K.Y.	We agree.

	Spender is sensitive re our attitude.  If we make any reservations,

		make them separately:  following a document statg. broad

		agreemt.



O.	Agree – with K.Y.



A.V.A.	Don’t play down by that means our objn to Philippines.



E.Sh.	Danger (political) of U.K. not being in.  Leavg. Pacific defence to U.S.



A.	Support that view.  H. Kong:  an old &amp; important commitmt.

		Our naval forces in Pacific will be much larger than Australian.

		V. gt. pol. disadvantages.



A.B.	Pol. dynamite – esp. after Fechteler.  After surrendering U.K. interest

		in Atlantic, we are now surrendering Pacific Comm. to U.S.



J.	Support.  Sacrificing Comm. to U.S.



H.G.	But, if we insist on coming in, we are back on island chain conceptn.

		Can we go in, w’out saying anythg. re Malaya &amp; H.K.

		Wd it commit A. or U.S. to help in defence of Malaya etc.



J.G.	But if our Colonies included, what of Indonesia, Indo-China etc.

	Alternative must be comprehensive Pacific pact.



E.Sh.	Memo. on Global Strategy:  we agreed it shd. be discussed with U.S.

		Ques. of security in Pacific shd. have bn. considered in reln to

		that.

		Premature to determine now what shd. be done in Pacific.

		Plenty of time for discussion.

	Nervous also of effects of this on M/East.  Divert A. &amp; N.Z. strengths

		to Pacific.



A.B.	Can’t we discourage A. – on basis tht. this cuts right across conceptn

		of Comm.



P.M.	We can’t come in w’out incldg. Malaya etc.

	We can’t get the others to guarantee those.

	A. &amp; N.Z. will say:  why stop us fr. gettg. protn you can’t provide.



O.	a)	A. &amp; N.Z. don’t think this inconsistent with Comm.

	b)	U.K. has its place in N.A.T.O.  We didn’t ask to come into that.

			We will look after yr. interests in Pacific.

	c)	If you stop us gettg. this Treaty, it will disturb Comm. relns.

	d)	This was not U.S. initiative:  but Australian.  They raised it

			with Dulles.



A.B.	At least suspend – until we have taken further soundings.

	If A. &amp; N.Z. really want it, they must guarantee to gag W.S.C.



H.McN.	We all agree we cdn’t enter into Pact not covering Malaya etc.

	Austr. [&amp; N.Z.] have for years bn. hankering after U.S. naval 

		guarantee:  both sides of Austr. public opinion.  Indeed, we

		favoured it:  &amp; complained tht. Evatt wrecked our chance of it.

	They believe this = best they can get as offset to Jap. Peace Treaty.

	If we oppose this we shall estrange Austr. opinion.



E.Sh.	Want U.K. associated in some way – e.g. w’out necessarily bringing

		in Malaya etc.



E.B.	What of the bill.  How cd. we afford to guarantee Pacific as well as

		anything else.



H.D.	Look at Pacific situation realistically.

	Try to get  ourselves associated – w’out bringing ourselves fully in

		qua Colonies.



K.Y.	When we are associated, we get into diffy about our own Colonies.

		don’t want Pact wh. wd. get A. Commd to defence of Japan.



T.W.	Cd F.O. &amp; C.R.O. discuss means of associatg. U.K. otherwise as full

		partner.



E.B.	Cd we get back to my original idea of Br. Comm. + U.S. together

		joining in Pacific Pact.



C.E.	This, if we are excluded, wd. give impn we are disinterestg. ourselves

		in Pacific.



		Discussion Adjourned, for further considn

		by F.O., C.R.O. &amp; M/Defence.





	5.	Falkland Islands Survey.



H.G.	No strategic or econ. advantage.  Cab. decided not to assert our claims

		by force.  Others refuse to go to internatl court..........



E.Sh.	Do we wish to remain at all?  Even C.O. agrees we shd.  Ques.

		therefore is shd. it be 4 bases or 6.  We favour 6.  For if we are

		going to stay at all we must do it effectively.  Not merely Chile

		&amp; Argentine.  R. have experience in Arctic.  Politically, we shd.

		support F.O.



H.G.	Thought there was no strategic argument.  Only prestige.



A.V.A.	Falklands is vital strategically.  Argentines have claimed them as well

		as dependencies.  We shall weaken that, if we weaken our posn

		in the dependencies.



H.G.	Two more huts won’t affect that issue.



H.McN.	The huts are symbol of our struggle with Argentine.  Support F.O.



E.Sh.	I wd. rather find the money myself for the other two.



E.B.	Have saved equivalent by agreeing with A. not to have naval expedns.

	I want flag to fly there.  Huts are cheaper than H.M. ships.



P.M.	Must have bases there.  No good having ineffective bases.

			Agree in principle - £100.000.

				[Exit  C.O.S.

				[Enter  Davies &amp; H.



	6.	Four Power Meeting.



K.Y.	Soviet reply expected to-day.

	Opening date 5/3 was suggested.

	3 Power talks in W’ton re an agenda with some precision.  Want a

		short one, w’out detail.

	Haven’t put detail into memo:  for had hoped for later news.

		Only suggns:  Austrian Treaty shd. come early, as test of R.

			sincerity.

		Fr. want satellite Peace Treaties on.

		First item:  causes of intern. tension, incldg. level of 

			armaments etc. (U.S. formula).  So as to avoid being 

			bogged down on Germany.

	Can’t give more def. instns as yet.



E.B.	We shd. find means of raising ques. of R. technique of provoking

		civil war vice foreign war.  Cab. might. think how to do this.

	Even if we can’t get settlement, we might. make it clear we wd. 

		regard such actn as tantamount to war.  Might have effect of

		checking it v. Yugoslavia.



A.V.A.	A.B.’s statement in Def. Debate was helpful.

	Spkers. in H/L. have asked us to go further – declare in advance it wd.

		be casus belli.



J.	Can’t say more than tht. “we shd. have then to take counsel with our

		friends.”



A.B.	I suggd for agenda pact of non-aggression incldg. Yugoslavia.

	This cd. now be carried a point further.  R. wd. be in diff. moral

		posn if they refused it.  Let us press it at the C.F.M. mtg.



E.B.	Ventilate this in H/L. today.  You’ve gone so far now, you cd. make

		it clear to R. tht. this game can’t be played with impunity.

		No harm in mentioning Pact.

	Later – better perhaps leave it to me to seek another opportunity.





E.B.	Representation at preliminary mtg.



Davies.	Reserve Henderson for later discn.  Also H. identified with Germany.



H.M.	Must be paired. 



A.B.	Para. 4.  Final sentence.  I don’t accept posn tht. we can’t have an

		agreemt. limited only to German re-armament.



H.D.	Follows on para. 3., wh. I approve.



P.M.	Also that we must be able to put R. in dock over their armaments.



			                                    [Exit  H. and E.D. and O.

			                                    [Enter  Att.G., Wheatley &amp; Att.

				Solr. Genl.

	3. (resumed)Reserve Forces Bill.



E.Sh.	Alternatives – re-stated as before.



Att.G.	1934 Act &amp; common law apply to all in reserve forces, wtr. calling

		up notices served or not.  Tho’ public don’t realise it – even 

		reservists themselves.

	Cl. designed to make it clear &amp; remove doubt.

	Alternatives now

		a)	leave clause, adding “maliciously &amp; advisedly” wh. have

			no effect.

		b)	w’draw altogether:  explaing. why we had included it.

		c)	substitute provn declarg. 1934 applies to all.

		d)	amend cl. so as to restrict it to men recvg. notices.  That

			wd. exclude 1934 Act, poss. in respect of a reserve forces.

			It wd. cut down stringency of existg. law.



P.M.	Wd a) satisfy H/C.



Att.	Tories but not our chaps.



H.M.	Our chaps wd. be content with b).  That wd. be simplest.



E.Sh.	Wd it help to do a) plus w’drawal of sub-sectn (2).



H.M.	Cd we say:  Govt. have sought means of meeting views of H/C.

		Thght. of (d).  Found tht. at this point no new provn needed

		at all.  Can rely on existg. law.



Att.G.	Object of clause was to make it clear law applied to reservists.



E.Sh.	H/C. didn’t object to 1934 provn.  Cd we have clause relatg. that to

		Z. reservists.



J.G.	Remember French strikes were broken by calling up strikers as 

		reservists.



Att.G.	Whatever course you adopt, you are bound to make it clear tht. 

		reservists are members of Forces.



E.Sh.	Let us have a) plus d):  which is what Service Ministers want.



Att.G.	Then net result is to reduce stringency of existing law.



A.B.	Which is what I want to do.



J.	No lawyer cd. defend that.  For reasons given……



E.Sh.	Then best concln = drop clause altogether.  (b) above.



A.B.	Then we must say we rely on 1934 Act &amp; it applies to all reservists.



Att.G.	Real alternatives are between a) and b).



E.Sh.	Prefer (a).  Take a chance on it.		Agreed.
