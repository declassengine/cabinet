C.M. 15(51).				22nd February, 1951.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  W.W., K.Y.



H.M.	Transport Bill (23/2) – will need good whipping.  Conservatives

		are active in its support.

	Business for next week.



A.	Morris:  Ques. re Tourist Agency, saying in U.S. tht. visitors to

		F/Britain will have plenty of food.  Allegns:  untrue.  No power

		in H/L. to refuse such a Ques, as there wd. be in H/C.



H.W.	We have a good answer.



	Defence Debate to-day.  European Army will be a considerable point.

		Layton is to speak.



A.V.A.	We can say “sub judice” because confce sitting in Paris.



E.Sh.	Can’t attack the conception, for it wd. offend French:  nor cd. we 

		support it.  We are sending an observer – H.M. Amb. in Paris.

		If Fr. plan succeeded, that Army cd. come into N.A. Force.



H.D.	Also tilt at Europ. M/Defence.



P.M.	The mongrel force, if formed, cd. come into N.A. Force.



K.Y.	We must be neutral to it, tho’ we won’t join it:  as with Schuman Plan.

		Federation by a side-wind.



H.M.	W.S.C. wants F.A. debate round 13/3.  Seems a bit soon.



			                                          [Exit  W.W.

			                                          [Enter  N.B., R.R.S., B. &amp; G.S.



	2.	Economic Report.



H.G.	Sitn satisf.

	Unemplt. falling.



H.D.	40% still in special areas.  Not therefore a sign of inflation yet.



H.W.	Mersey is worst.  But plans maturing wh. will wipe out all unemplt.



H.D.	It is to sp. areas tht. addl. defence prodn shd. go.



H.G.	Is going.  New defence work goes there where poss.  Where not, 

		firm puttg. balance of displaced civil work there.



H.G.	Coal.  Output rising.  Shd. now get thro’ w’out industrial trouble,

		unless v. cold weather v. soon.



N.B.	Output has bn. better. 700.000 t. better in last 6 wks. than 1950 –

		6 wks. fr. end of 1st wk. in Jan.

	Absenteeism high:  but mainly due to ‘flu.

	Opencast 300.000 t. down because rain, as cpd. 1950.

	Imports below expected average.  O.K. if balance comes in Mar/Apl.

	Stocks rising in last 3 wks.

	If imports improve, &amp; output m’tained, shall end coal year with

		satisf. stocks level (? 9 m. tons).

	But rlway. strike wd. bring crisis condns in 1 or 2 weeks.



P.M.	Improvemt. in man-power is v. good.

 

A.B.	It is return to pits of ex-miners.  Can’t therefore expect it to continue at

		this rate.

	1)	Don’t commit ourselves this year to output figure.

	2)	Stock posn shd. rank with exports throughout the year.  We are

			running on too narrow a margin.  Need higher sticks, for			pol. reasons – vulnerable to Commn in coal-fields.



H.G.	Agree with 2).  Will consider 1).



J.G.	The target set by P.M. for winter drive was valuable psychol.



B.	No further chartering of ships for coal imports.  We shd. go on thro’

		summer, if we want the coal.



N.B.	N.C.B. want to go on importg.  I doubt this, politically.



H.M.	Economy in coal consumptn.  Cd. this be included in future reports.



H.G.	Better to have a memo.  For this can’t be quantified.



	Steel Production.



H.G.	Jan. output lower than ’50 – as also textiles.  Is this sickness?

	Lack of sheet.  Short-time on cars.



G.S.	We shall have to cut genl. steel allocns.  Increased demand, &amp; less

		scrap fr. G. – cut of 5% seems inevitable.

	Cut of 15/20% made already in sheet.  Because can’t buy abroad.

		That will continue until Margam comes in at end ‘/51.

	Total annual for 1951 likely to fall by up to ¾ m. tons because

		shortage of scrap.



H.G.	Will knock our assumptn of 4% increase in productivity.



H.M.	In the 1st year of natn.



G.S.	Scrap shortage in G.  Everyone wants more, incldg. Germans.



H.M.	Grave pol. and econ. consequences.



A.B.	Industry is ill-balanced under private industry – not enough pig-iron 	and overmuch dependence on scrap imports.



H.M.	Prodn Cttee must consider.  V. important.		Agreed.



	Textiles Production.



H.W.	‘Flu has affected cotton output.  Also r. materials shortages – unusual

		types of cotton having to be used.

	Wool.  Short-time &amp; unemplt. soon.  Because of high prices.

		Stocks won’t be carried by merchants. Think they are wrong:

		prices won’t drop.



H.G.	They also find diffy in financg. holdg. of large stocks.



G.T.	Finer types of cotton are better:  but coarser are more profitable

		to workers &amp; owners.



	Bricks.



H.G.	Low stocks.



R.R.S.	Survey made.  By Oct. prodn at rate of 7.2 thous. mill. cpd. under  

		6 in ’50.

		With Ital. labour – accepted by Unions.  If labour available,

		trade can reach target.

	Stock posn shd. improve fr. May onwds.



	Timber.



H.W.	Stocks low for next 3 mos.  Strike in Finland.  Shipping moved over

		to coal.  Recovering now.  Licensg. will revert to normal fr.

		March.  But stocks won’t be much above 200.000 st.

		vice 300.  Shall be a month behind in stock-bldg.

	Private buyers have done well in France &amp; Austria.

	From July we shd. be better off than for years.



H.D.	M/W. &amp; I aren’t happy.  Shortfall of 10.000 st. for 2 mos. was 

		suffered &amp; that shd. be made good.  Can’t we get it now fr.

		Pacific coast.



H.W.	Have promised to consider in March makg. up that cut.

	Can’t ship fr. there in less than 3/4 months.  We have chartered as

		much as we cd. w’out wreckg. freight market.  All we’ve bght.

		will be shipped – with one month lost because coal.

	In March (2 wks. ahead) will consider wtr. I can accept this redn in

		stocks thro’ makg. up cut.  Must wait until I can gauge stock posn 

		on basis of private buying.



R.R.S.	Pushg. bldg. industry to do more.  Shortage will develop just when

		weather improves.  Must have 20.000 cut restored in Apl/June.

		No good bringing it in later.



H.G.	Three ques.

		i)	Shd. you allocate more, on basis of shipmts. expected.

			Doubtful if we’ll be able to w’out endangering stocks.

		ii)	Accelerate shipments.  Too many Dpts. are holding off

			because think prices will fall.  I wd. favour bringing this

			in, quick.



H.McN.	Will M/W. also buy bricks?



P.M.	Let Prodn Cttee consider all this.



H.M.	Form of report.  Section on raw Materials in future.



	Stock Position.



H.G.	Internl sitn is worst factor.  Not sure wtr. even so, Dpts. are buying

		enough.  Prodn Cttee will consider all this.



	Wages.



H.G.          x/	Near end of 1st round, save for rlways.

	Seen T.U.C. – not in favour of our ideas, but were aware tht. somethg.

		will have to be done.



A.B.	Agree with x/.  And increases modest.  Sometimes too modest –

		&amp; industrial unrest caused in consequence.

	But further applns if price increases continue.



	Balance of Payments.



H.G.	V. heavy adverse balance in Jan.  Higher prices &amp; heavier quantities

		of imports.



H.D.	Germany are exploiting E.P.U.



H.G.	They haven’t carried out promises.  We must stop keeping them.

		May have to do export licensing.



H.D.	They shd. be exporting more:  &amp; cf. what was said of scrap.



H.W.	Raw Materials generally.  No chance of gettg. 1950 prodn

			on present prospects.  Prodn Cttee.



E.Sh.	Makes nonsense of U.S. attitude towards our defence effort.



				[Exit  R.R.S. &amp; G.S.

	3.	Railway Strike.



A.B.	Rpt. of enquiry provoked sharp re-action fr. men.  Saw R.E.C. on

		Fri. p.m. &amp; later Unions.  R.E.C. accepted report:  Union 

		rejected it.  Stalemate.  Pity they announced posns:  for was 

		report not award.

	Asked my opinion.  I said rept. was mistaken in attachg. condns of

		work to wages.  First can only be secured by co-opn.  I therefore

		suggd sepn of the two things.  Relns betwn. R.E.C. &amp; Unions too		poisoned.

	R.E.C. have now adopted formula (agreed with Unions) tht. as soon

		as wages settled, they will discuss condns of work with Unions.

		Good line.

	Unions said discns going on in good spirit.

	We may be over the hump.

	When last nght. negotns on wages broke, R.E.C. wanted to announce

		it.  I urged them not to.  Preferred to say “discns adjourned”.

		To avoid ques. of face.  R.E.C. behaved v. foolishly in so 

		slamming the door.

	Rpt. recommended average increase of 5%.  Court bound to look at

		profits:  so statute requires.  Break-down on £2¾ m.  Unions

		want only 7½% - dockers got that.  Folly to risk b’down of our

		economy over £2¾ m.  N.U.R. specially anxious for 7½%.

	If R.E.C. hadn’t announced what they did last night, I cd. have got a

		settlement.  Unions want to “adjourn”.

	Shall meet R.E.C. this p.m. &amp; seek renewal of negotns.



B.	There are further facts.  When Unions made their demands, &amp; ques.

		of efficiency raised, Unions rejected latter &amp; ran to M/L. 

		before mtg. R.E.C.  And M/L. set up court – incldg. 2 responsible

		T. Unionists.  Read its report, wh. was unanimous:  it said R.E.C.

		was enough.  Unions repudiated it publicly, at once.  And refused

		to urge members to observe restraint while discns were going on.

		This is first time in rlway. history tht. T.U. leaders have allowed

		this strike pressure to be applied while discns procdg.

	True, public opinion (despite report) don’t like some men being under

		£5 p. wk.  R.E.C. have indicated readiness to re-open that ques.

		Linked, remember, to agric. wages &amp; road-men.  And further

		£2¼ m. offer was made.

	This only covers conciliation grades.  When the 9¼ m. is worked thro’

		it will be £14 m.  And 7½% means £17 m.  And re-actions on 

		other transport – road.

	A.B. told me he thght. his report was wrong.  It’s his procedure:

		I conformed to it.



A.B.	I only expd a personal view, in private conversation.

 

B.	Managemt. has offered maximum they are justified in offering.

		With this wage increase, on top of increased costs of coal &amp;

		petrol, 15% increase in freight rates wd. be necessary.

A.B.	And because of last night’s public statement, any concession by 

		R.E.C. will seem to be deferring to Govt. pressure or strike.

	The shop-men depends on engineering rates, not this.



N.B.	Agree N.U.R. shd. have called for restraint.

	But I support A.B.  There is unrest among the men.  This is like the

		Porter award last summer:  Govt. had to put that right.

	Most unwise to have a strike for sake of £2¼ m.  Cost of that wd. be

		v. much greater.

	In natd indies we ought not to insist on less for workers because we

		have more control.



H.M.	Disturbed at Union’s attitude re efficiency.  Don’t agree tht. it’s

		unreasonable to link that with wages.  Esp. in view of their

		deficit.

	Gt. redundancy of labour on rlways.



H.G.	Disaster of genl. rail strike.  Both genl. &amp; immediately on coal.

	We are up against that.  Can’t afford genl. stoppage or even work by

		rule.



C.E.	Emergencies Cttee.  We cd. do virtually nothg. to mitigate effects of a 

		genl. rlway. strike.  Short of calling for volunteers on basis of 

		Genl. Strike.



B.	Cab. decision, if any, shd. be made to-day.



H.M.	Try &amp; get them talking.  Cab. shdn’t decide how much the men shd.

		have.



H.G.	Tho’ R.E.C. shd. have a tip.



P.M.	Get the 2 sides together.

				[Exit  N.B. &amp; B.



	4.	Immigration of Br. Subjects into U.K.



C.E.	Not so acute as to warrant action.  If it becomes so, shall come to Cab.



J.	May be in trouble over this sort of thing because Human Rghts. 

		Convns.



			Memo. approved.
