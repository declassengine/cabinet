C.M. 50(50)							25th July 1950



		1.	Inter-Parliamentary Union.		[Enter Ogmore and K.Y.



C.E.	Inter-Parly Union mtg. in Dublin.  U.K. Delegn includes Savory and Delongy.

	F.O. suggestg. offer shd. appl. to them and give advice on Partition.

	Think Minister shd. do so, if needed.

	But prob. they need no advice.



P.M.	Perhaps C.E. wd. do it himself, with Ogmore.



	Agreed: C.E. to see Milner (Leader of Delegation).





		2.	Defence Expenditure.



P.M.	Explained recommns of Defence Cttee.

	Additional £100 m. on Defence – of which £30 m. wd. fall in current year.

	Europeans now showg. signs of getting a move on: and U.S. will be willing to make a contribn.

	Personnel problems – deficiencies in air crew. and tradesmen and poor recruiting for regulars.  Continued as in brief.



E.Sh.	D. Estimates for 50/51 were based on £840 – reduced to £810 – and Cab. decided £780.  The £30 m. only covers that gap – to £810.

	Immediate deficiencies – and to increase slope of original programme.

	Must have big figure next year.  Don’t need to state precise figure in Parlt.  But must give a hint.

	Service Pay.  Diff. to find a formula.  Not ready with details: Cttee’s rept. still with Service Dpts.  No increase for Nat. Service men.  Air crew and tradesmen shd. be mentioned.  Also need to increase regular content by recruitment and by inducg. N.S. men to stay on.  Want therefore to hint tht. some pay increases will be required.



R.S.C.	Thght Def. Cttee had taken view tht. no commitment wd. be made in Debate.

	For we may either increase pay or increase period of N. Service.

	If we mention genl. pay increases, we may find ourselves doing both.



P.M.	Must refer to special rates for tradesmen.



R.S.C.	Don’t go beyond that.



P.M.	Say doing differentials for R.A.F.: lookg. into wider appls and so forth.



E.Sh.	Not proposing to foreshadow any increase in basic pay.  But for special skills some special inducements are required.



	Agreed :  E.Sh. to settle form of words with R.S.C.



E.Sh.	On general posn we have a good case.  Much equipment – but a few deficiencies wh. must be made good before we can fight.

	No help fr. Europe.  Shall have to give supplies to them.

	Somethg. fr. U.S. – aircraft and may get more.

	R. strengths: we have detailed informn.  Shd. I tell H/C. what we know.

	I favour doing so.  Hard facts shd. not be withheld.



P.M.	Give it.  If you don’t, W.S.C. will.



A.V.A.	If you disclose in detail, our intelligence sources will dry up.

	But Soviet Budget gives general deduction v. defence expenditure.



E.Sh.	40 fully equipped divns cd. mount immediate attack.



P.M.	Give a broad picture.



E.Sh.	Shall present potential combined strength of Allies.



P.M.	Doubtful – depends on time of deployment.

	Expenditure.



A.B.	This will absorb all increased productivity over next few years.  i) No improved standards of living.  ii) And we have set wages free.  iii) We had already banked on increased productivity to sustain our dollar balance.

	Concln: standards must be reduced, or we must accept contd dependence on U.S.

	R.S.C. doesn’t mind: for he will take it off civil Dpts.  But social implicns.



	We shd. have chance of examing. these.



R.S.C.	These major ques. will have to be settled on Def. Estimates.

	At present we commit ourselves only to mtg. deficiencies – 30 m. now and 70 m. in next year.



A.B.	i) No action now to commit us to £200 m. extra in 1951/52.

	ii) Assurance tht. this addl. prodn will absorb unemployed.



R.S.C.	Being investigated now.  Naval p’mme will absorb shipyard unemployment.



H.D.	Also reversion of R.O.F.’s in developmt. areas to war prodn.



R.S.C.	Yes: on the longer term.  Dispersal must be taken into a/c.



A.B.	Marry all this into our economic plans.



P.M.	Will be done. 



H.McN.  	Useful if a sentence to that effect were made in debate.   



R.S.C.  	By P.M.  Have suggd a draft



A.V.A.	W.S.C. will say: re-arm Germany.  What will you say?



E.Sh.	I shall ask F.O.

	Civil Defence Expenditure.   D.O. recommns approved.





		3.	Korea.



P.M.	Put D.O. views v. 1 Brigade Group.



T.W.	Age limit?



E.Sh.	Shall have to include a no. of N.S. men. 



A.B.	Aggressor will always have advantage if we spread our forces over all soft spots, in small packets.



E.Sh.	Militarily not v. desirable.  Psychologically inevitable.



A.B.	I mean force shd. be larger.



P.M.	U.S. are going to hit him v. hard.



H.D.	Favour proposal.  But keep it at token strength.  And Emphasise our contns at sea and in air.

							[Exit Ogmore.



		4.	Enquiry into Income Tax.



R.S.C.	As in memo.   P.M. and I to concert membership.



H.D.	i)  Wd. like “equitably” distributg. tax burden, in t. of ref.



R.S.C.	“Fairly” after burden.   Agreed.



H.D.	ii) 1920 Commn included Wm. Graham.  M.P.’s were not debarred then.  There are some today.



R.S.C.	Labour outside H/C. is a better source fr. wh. to supply this need.



H.D.	I will suggest names.  Socialist though shd. be represented.



H.McN.	A Scot.



J.	Don’t announce tht. chairman will be a Judge.



	P.M.  to secure approval of the King.

						             [Enter Wheatley &amp; W.W.



		5.	Overseas Operations (Security of Forces) Bill.



P.M.	Took A.G.’s points in memo.

	

	i) Associated Powers – point approved.

	ii) Cl. 1(1) “Shortly”.



J.	I’m against all this preamble etc.  Why not take simple power to declare an emergency.



G.A.I.	Seen T.U.C.



Wh.	Cdn’t give answer y’day.  They had Cttee this morning wh. considered memo by Att.Genl.



	It was put to them tht. Cl. 2(5) was unnecessary because intent was essential ingredient in Cl. 2(2).  Psychological only.  And once you discriminate betwn. one kind of strike and another you are in trouble.



	T.U.C. say psychologically unnecessary.  And they prefer D. Reg formula.



P.M.	Then the Bill is useless.



G.A.I.	My Dpt. favour omitting Cl. 2(5).

	Don’t really know what T.U.C. want.



P.M.	Can’t v. well go on with the Bill if no sound basis with T.U.C.



A.B.	This Bill won’t help you to catch Communists because T.U.C. insist on savings for workmen and these cover Comms. too.



H.M.	Lost psychological moment.  T.U.C. is uncertain.  Drop this now. and keep it for next Session.



R.S.C.	Go on with prepn of a Bill.  But more effective Bill.

	L.P., G.A.I., C.E., J. and L.O.’s to review the position.

	[How far existg. law covers mischief.

	[How can it be strengthened.

	Consult with T.U.C.
