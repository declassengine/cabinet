C.M. 46(50)							                   17th July 1950



		1.	Mr. Menzies.



P.M.	Welcome – old friend – peace and war.

	V. suitable moment.





		2.	Military Situation.



C.N.S.	Remains critical.  Korean defence line fallen this am.  Line of retreat across enemy.



	S.K. fightg. better in east – may mean less dangerous.

	Best U.S. can do is hold bridge head.

	U.S. C.N.S. has said we’ve done enough at sea and shdn’t weaken ourselves in W.



	Land forces: no word yet.

	Signs of increasg. R. sub activity in F/E. 30/40 there.

	We have 40 destroyers/frigates.  But subs wd. be v. dangerous.



C.I.G.S.	42 k. 196 w. 265 odd missing.  Total U.S. casualties.  1 Divn. engaged – but only 2 Rgts. seriously.



	Divns. not at full strength – peace establmts.  Small force.

	R. tanks impervious to war time bazooka.



	Our 17 pds. wd. deal with them.  Only 1 battery in H. Kong.  They will get their own fr. U.S. as quickly.



	Only 2 U.S. divns left in Japan.  Won’t send more from there, except one (cavalry divn)



C.N.S.	1 addl carrier nearly there.  Marine Divn. due arrive Aug.  Only 1 Brigade Group.



C.I.G.S.	Koreans themselves not v. formidable.  Doing well because 2 Divns. embodied with R. for some time and R. mission of 2.500/3.000 with them.



	“Advisers” prob. in command.



C.A.S.	150 N. Korean aircraft.  S. Korean virtually nil.	

	U.S. had 500 in Japan includg. 80 bombers.  50 more B.29’s since and also Mustangs.  77 Austr. Squadr. also – had done v. well 

	Weather favours Koreans: July/Aug. are worst months.  Much cloud to 4/5.000 ft. and mountains that high.  Up to first 3 wks. flown on 1200 sorties.  Close support of troops in the main - tho’ B-29’s are going for oil targets.

	1 Br. + 1 U.S. carrier, also.

	Weather = main reason why air hasn’t had more effect.

	Various targets in N. Korea – industrial.  But so far attacks mainly on commns. 



P.M.	Hydro-electric plants alleged to serve China too.  Dangerous to attack them.  x  C.A.S. to look into this.  x.



C.A.S.	Successes v. tanks – claims prob. exaggerated.  Tho’ rockets used wd. be effective if they scored a hit.



M.	What prospects of hanging on?



C.I.G.S.	Depends how soon re-inforcemts. arrive.

	Their posn = same as ours in Burma in ’42.  Every line they try to hold 

	is circumvented by larger: more mobile numbers.



A.B.	Evce tht. R. Mission are with N. Korean troops.



C.I.G.S.	Identified (15) thro’ N. Korean p.o.w.   No R. fighting troops.



C.A.S.	Jet Yaks reported.  May be R. operated.



P.M.	U.S. mil. mission in field with S. Koreans?  



C.I.G.S. 	Probably.



T.W.	Reinforcement time?  



C.N.S.  	3 wks’ passage.



C.I.G.S.	At least 75% of U.S. troops have not had expce of battle.

	They are fighting well, despite U.S. press correspondents.

	50/50 chance wthr. U.S. reinforcements arrive before bridge-head is broken down.



A.B.	Are S. Korean civil popn welcomg. N. Koreans? 



C.I.G.S. 	On the whole, no.



A.B.	No Internatl Brigade fr. China?  



C.I.G.S. 	No sign of it yet.



A.B.	No publicity yet given to presence of R. Mission with N. Korean forces?  No.



C.E.	Nos. of U.S. troops in action so far?  



C.I.G.S.  	8/9.000.

C.E.	Aren’t casualties v. small if U.S. troops have bn. fighting hard.



C.I.G.S.	They do look low.  But form = U.S. falling back when S. Koreans front is broken and N. Koreans come round behind.  This means few casualties.



P.M.	Lie’s request for re-inforcements.  Odd that he shd. send it.



C.N.S.	Token force – supply commitmt wd. rule that out.

	Larger force – C.O.S. considg. this pm.

	U.S. have never asked us for more – not even for sea transport.



R.S.C.	In a bridge head other troops with separate supply lines wd. be useless.



P.M.	V. genl. request.  We are in trouble elsewhere.



H.D.	Some Tories wondering v. re-inforcements. fr. H. Kong on condn tht. U.S. wd. put replacements into H. Kong.  To get U.S. more identified with H. Kong.



P.M.	They might ask us then to come in to Formosa.



E.Sh.	Re-inforcements wd. mean callg. up reserves by Proclamn.

	Re-inforcements for Fleet and Naval Air Arm.  Believe this will involve Proclamn and announcemt. to H/C.



M.	Wd. upset long term planning. 



C.I.G.S. 	Visit – stress on M/East.

	Don’t want to get excessively preoccupied with F/East.

	Suppose we contributed a force to Korea – wd. interfere with home defence, M/E. prepns., Natl Service.  And psychol. diversion of public opinions – wh. wd. make it hostile to M/E. conceptn.  Wd. serve R. ends.

		I therefore feel peevish about Lie’s public appeal.

	Our squadron is crack one and considble propn of our fighters strength.

	My feeling: we shdn’t let R. push us off our main defensive strategy.



C.N.S.	Believe U.S. wd. agree.  They have told me not to weaken our naval posn in West.

	U.S. G.I. may think differently.  That’s why Bradley wanted some token forces.  Br. hospital ship, however, is now evacuatg. U.S. wounded.



M.	Token force wd. complicate supply unless they were assimilated to U.S. in weapons etc.

	Legal limitn on using Austr. troops N. of Equator.  92% of our Austr. force in Japan were enlisted for Japan – and wd. have to be invited to volunteer for other duty.  Only 586 are operational.



	Build-up fr. Austr. wd. be diff.  Already agreed with U.S. to recall them – partly to build up regular Army partly to train conscripts.

	Don’t want to disturb any of this.



P.M.	Personal message to Truman.  Bradley/Jessop nominated. Our chaps will join them about 19/7.  Those discns will cover whole show.  No decn to reinforce ground forces in Korea until those discns have made progress.



	Reported D.O. decns on strategic exports to China.   |

						 oil in China.   |  x



	Spoke from brief re. talks with U.S.

	First Korea.

	Formosa – v. embarrassing to us.  U.S. won’t get U.N. support esp. Asiatic nations.  Also genl. feeling throughout Commonwealth tht. we aren’t in on Formosa.

	Hong Kong.

	Malaya.

	Indo China.

	Further afield, must preserve our all-over strategic concept.

	Persia.

	Berlin.

	Gtest diffy. = Formosa.  Must disentangle that from Korea.



K.Y.	On x/ we were anxious to avoid publicity.  But diff. to avoid saying somethg. esp. on oil.  The C.O.S. have bn. questioned and hinted at Govt. dirn.  P.Q. on Wedy.  Can’t hush it up.  Can say we are pre-empting it for own purposes.  



P.M. 	And can say we must prevent it trickling into N. Korea.



H.M.	Lie’s request.  Curious procedure.  Shd. he have done this w’out authy fr. some organn of Security Council.  Shd. there not be some S. Council machinery for handling this sort of thing privately.



P.M.	Diffy.  We discouraged Cttee because of composn.  Was therefore left vague.



K.Y.	We aren’t fully aware what’s behind Lie’s request.

	He recd some approach from U.S. re further assistance.

	Certainly is embarrassing.  But may be fault of U.S. as well as Lie.



A.B.	Also want U.N. kept in picture.  Don’t want this to appear unilateral action by U.S.



P.M.	Tels. 705 and 706 fr. New York.



H.McN.	Lie also had responsibilities under Charter.

	U.S. must have prompted him.

P.M.	Evidently discussed with U.S., President of S. Council. and repve of S. Korea.



[J.	What wd. be involved in invading Korea if U.S. were thrown out. 



P.M.	C.O.S. have bn. asked for appreciation on that.]



M.	Not sure Lie is to be trusted.  This is significant action because it’s U.S. forces – not because it’s U.N. resoln.  Risk tht. he will assume functions of a Commr.  We shd. make it clear to him tht. we don’t want any more of this public manifesto method.  A little bold criticism.

	Wdn’t do any harm.



H.M. &amp; A.	Endorsed.  Avoid repetn.



E.Sh.	U.S. public won’t like it if we can’t respond.



P.M.	Wait until we have seen record of discn with Lie.



	Indo China.



E.Sh.	Urgent Fr. need of equipment – wd. enable Fr. to equip locals and return regular Fr. troops to Europe.

	U.S. mayn’t send this if they get bogged down in F/East.



P.M.	Reflectn of genl. posn tht. everything in W. Europe goes slow because Fr. are bogged down in Indo China.

	

	Malaya.



M.	Accepted C.I.G.S. view tht. this priority 1. in cold war.

	If we cd. lay hands on Commando Force, C.I.G.S. wd. still think best place for it wd. be Malaya not Korea? 



C.I.G.S.  	Yes.



	Team of jungle experts are on the way. Assured they will get all informn in Malaya despite their rank.  When they get back and report, my Govt. will consider wthr. there’s any more they can do.



	Egypt.



M.	Talked with Stevenson and then with F. Secy. a tricky gent.  He began by askg. what A. wd. do if U.K. got into war.  I  replied tht. we didn’t suffer fr. neutrality.  Then, he said, case for evacuation of Canal Zone is complete: for U.K. with A. and N.Z. wd. be there to save Egypt.



	I told him	i)  we regarded security of M/E as vital.

			ii) we were workg. with U.K.

	I asked cd. you defend Egypt?  He said: either yes, or if not fault of U.K. for keeping us unarmed etc. for 50 years.

	I tried to pin him down to practical point: what is needed as point for expansion of mil. strength in war.



C.I.G.S.	He is the worst of the lot.

	King knows wh. side his bread is buttered.

	And, apart fr. F. Secy., all Ministers realise N.O. point re defenceless and need of Br. base.  They don’t really want us to go.  But if any said that publicly – or suggd new conceptn of defence, equal alliance (as U.S. in U.K.) – others politically will say they are sold to British.  And they fear, in particular, tht. F. Secy. will rat on them.



	But they are trying to find some formula.  They are scared.



	Burma.



O.	When will those troops be disarmed?



C.I.G.S.	About 2.000 settled in corner nr. Siam.  Refuse disarmed.  Genl. went to Bangkok and made Press statement.  Burmese Army cdn’t deal with them.



	Worrying Thakin U.



	Comms. are split.  Karens have had it.  Govt. much stronger.  But Nai Win controls Army and Police and P.M. can’t control him.
