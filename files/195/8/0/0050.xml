C.M. 82(50).				5th December, 1950.



	1.	Korea.



	Report of P.M.’s first discussion with Truman.



H.M.	H/C. askg. for military statement (only) on Korea.



E.Sh.	Hold it off until Thursday.



E.B.	I can’t say anything while discns procdg. in W’ton.





	2.	Germany:  Soviet Proposal for Meeting of C.F.M.



E.B.	In view of U.N. resoln tht. Gt. Powers shd. meet, I have put in

		memo.  I wd. welcome Cab. views.



A.B.	V. diff. to discuss independently of outcome of W’ton talks.

		Cdn’t our officials stall m’while?



E.B.	Effect on R. of delay – wd. make it obvious tht. I link East &amp;

		Europe, if I p’poned mtg. of officials already arranged.

	Exchanges with U.S., away fr. Korea atmosphere, wd. be useful in 

		bringing U.S. into European mind – and frame of mind.

	May be, on report of offls., we shall have to consider in reln to W’ton

		talks.  Ready to agree there shd. be no final commitment.

	Want to give R. impn tht. we are going on with what I said in H/C. –

		any more than we are going back on U.N.  Satellites will be 

		keenly interested because frontiers not fixed.



A.B.	Ques. for us = what directions are we to give to officials.

		Suppose we said we were ready to consider unificn of G. w’out

		re-arming them.  That, once it came out in Paris talks, wd. go at

		once to W’ton.  U.S. might then disinterest themselves in

		defence/Europe.



A.	Public opinion strongly in favour of exploring possibility of 

		4 Power mtg.



H.D.	We can’t run out of Thursday’s mtg.

	But Course E wd. enable us to start talking w’out compromising

		results of W’ton.  They cd. spin it out by discussing what R. wd.

		be ready to discuss.



H.McN.	The offls. must meet &amp; must avoid giving impression that they aren’t

		meaning business.

	But avoid compromising P.M.’s talks.

	Any course other than E wd. involve things embarrassing to U.S.A.



H.M.	Cd. you let offls. talk of alternatives &amp; submit recommns.



E.B.	Ready to say:  all you can do, as things have developed, is prepare

		the reply to R. note.

	Prepare a reply which gives a wider basis to the points at issue.

		And spin out the preliminaries.



H.M.	Or let them discuss all alternatives, w’out commitment.



E.Sh.	Look at para. 25.  That is the truth.  And it’s not reflected in any of the

		alternative “Courses”.

	Is there not another Course viz., to seek to promote a change of heart

		in R.  Prs. by a Heads of States mtg.

	Does R. really want to dominate the world.  If so, it means war –

		sooner or later.  And what assurance of continuing U.S. support

		in Europe.  France seems to be trying to contract out.  And the 

		rest are of no value.

		Hence, shd. we not seek solution by political means.



H.McN.	This, if seriously meant, is radical departure on policy.

	Our whole policy is geared to assumptn of U.S. support in Europe.



J.G.	Discuss alternatives w’out commitment.

	Deep concern, however, in Party.  Can’t fight unless our people are

		   with us.

	R. having made offer, we can take initiative.  Don’t p’pone talks.



A.B.	Ready to face internl sitn when all facts known.

	Party won’t make trouble while P.M. is in W’ton.



G.W.	All courses save E. raise big policy ques.  Shd. they go to officials

		in this state.

	Let talks be limited to Course E.



T.W.	Delete F. &amp; let officials discuss A-E.



C.E.	Had hoped this memo. wd. force us to think out a policy.

		Wdn’t be so bad to refer A-E to U.K. officials.  But U.S.

		&amp; French are to be in it.  Some of this wd. be v. unfavourably

		received by U.S.A.  E.g. admission of China to U.N.



G.T.	Object of mtg. = draft a reply to R. note.  That cd. be spun out for

		several days.



E.B.	We must settle a reply to R. note.

		Fr. wd. prob. be willing to meet on R. terms.

		U.S. are au fond prob. don’t want a mtg.

		I think we ought to have a shot at it.

	Put this memo. back in F.O. (shd. be kept v. secret).

	Tell officials to draft reply to R. note.  Try in it to broaden

		substantially – in order of priority put tension points before

		coming down to Germany.  Don’t be in too great a hurry.

		Spin it out until after W’ton talks.  They may submit

		alternatives – diverging views.  Try for draft implying tht. a

		mtg. (F Power) will be held.

	Have discussed with Kelly.  In Moscow they are waiting.  We cd. 

		force them into wrong reaction.  Need for care.
