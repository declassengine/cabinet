C.M. 61(50).							        26th September 1950.



							[Enter H.G., E. Davies., Att.G.

		1.	Gas Strike.



G.A.I.	M’tenance men only are affected.  Applied 5d p. hr. increase: negotiated settlement by Union at 1½d: men won’t accept it.

	Fedn anxious tht. M/L. shd. work thro’ them not go to local Union wh. in Ldn. is dominated by Communists.  No means of reachg. rank and file.

	Now telling Fedn we must go direct to Unions.  Main trouble is E.T.U. is Comm. dominated.

	Trying to find out if producers wd. come out if we put troops in.

	Attempts to spread it beyond N.E. Ldn. have so far failed.



C.E.	Offl. Cttee mtg. this pm.



Att.G.	Have written to Ministers re prosecn of leaders of Cttee for themselves going on strike.  Cd. get them – wd. it spread the strike.



G.A.I.	I feel bold.



P.M./C.E.	Let Ministerial Cttee also meet.  And don’t authorise prosecns if they do decide – not w’out further refce to Cabinet.



Att.G.	Procdgs. wd. be under compuls.  Arbitn Order – qua illegal.





		2.	Korea: Future Policy.



	Consolidated text fr. draft resoln as revised handed round.



P.M.	A good draft.

	Was anxious to avoid unregulated and unauthorised pursuit over 38th Parallel.  Also concerned re Koreans.  Part C is important – also economic resoln at end.



A.B.	Why mention N. Korea.



Att.G.	Initial Govt. wd. be mil. under McArthur.  Shd. give place quickly to civil Govt.  Unwise to let existg. S. Korean Govt. loose in the North.

	Read out 4 points – in substitn for existg. draft.

	Legal posn.  Strictly Assembly prob. not entitled to make any such recommn until S. Council is quit of it.  But inopportune to press this strict view of the law.



H.M.	Fear Comms. will capture a free Govt. when it is establd.  Can we avert that?



A.B.	F.O. memo. threw sponge in over that.

	We must include clause tht. we (U.N.) hold fort until it’s clear tht. democr. govt. can stand.



H.G.	We are v. strained economically.  Assistce must be on basis of what is really necessary – no more China.  We shd. be represented.  And contribns shd. be fair.



E.D.	Ad hoc Cttee after consultn with E.C.O.S.O.C., separate fr. Commission.



H.G.	We shd. be on.  



E.D.  	And a lot of Asians.



H.McN.	Shift to Assembly dangerous precedent - ⅔ lobby v. us on Col. ques. Can’t avoid it.  But warn U.S. of dangers.

                  x/  in A. of Resoln.   V. diff.  Shd. make it clear tht. S. Ree has no title to lead a govt. of Korea.  Mustn’t appear to be sustaing. him.



	Three states  i) mil. govt.  ii) Quick transfer to a civil govt. iii) Longer prepns for free elections.



	Econ. rehabiln: Keep S.E.A. Commn out of it.  Don’t therefore go near E.C.O.S.O.C.  (Agreed).



G.W.	India will be troubled re going beyond 38th Parallel.  Later on might acquiesce – won’t support resoln now.

	Still think it right to go on.

	India prob. won’t make trouble over it.

	Canada takg. legalistic point tht. original electns in K. are valid for whole country.

	Rest of Comm. likely to support.



E.Sh.	C.O.S. anxious not to commit our troops n. of 38th Parallel.

	Want to get our chaps out as quick as possible.



Att.G.	Somethg. like para. on p. 2 ought to go in.



P.M.	Wiser to leave it more open.



G.W.	The main point is a good one – civil govt. gap.



P.M. 	Call attentn of E.B. to that gap w’out }

	suggesting words.			}  Agreed.

			Let E.B. know views of C.O.S.

							                 [Enter C.E.



A.V.A.	This resoln wd. commit us to support action beyond 38th P. – paras. A. and B.

	Remember dangers in Germany. Mustn’t risk open conflict.

P.M.	Can’t say tht. in no circs. can U.N. Forces go beyond this imaginary line.  Can’t say tht. U.K. Forces mayn’t go if others do.



Att.G.	Whole resoln assumes mil. control of N. Korea.  Cdn’t supervise elections etc. unless U.N. had control.



J.G.	Critical moment when U.N. Forces cross 38th p.

	If we do it deliberately, after Koreans beaten, our reasons for going on must be clearly seen.



E.Sh.	Make it clear to E.B. tht. if U.N. Forces go beyond 38th p. they do so for limited purpose.  May be guerrilla warfare for ages.  Are we going to commit our troops for so long?



A.B.	Can’t in reason stop at 38th p.  For we believe in unified Korea.



H.McN.	Supported this view.  H.M. and P.M. also.

							             [Exit G.W.



E.D.	To stop at 38th p. wd. = R. victory.



P.M.	E.Sh.’s point can only be met by warning E.B. tht. we don’t want our troops committed there for too long.



E.D.	F.O. have addl para. in tel. to Nehru.
