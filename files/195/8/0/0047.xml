C.M. 79(50).				30th November, 1950.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  Att.G., W.W.



H.M.	Business for next week.

	Debate on Wales:  industrial subjects mainly.  Govt. spokesmen?

	{	Parly Secretary B/T. and P.M.G. (to reply).  M/F &amp; P. to 

	{	watch because silicosis cases.



T.W.	Technical education may also be discussed – if they cd. get 2nd day.

		Also agriculture, which is mentioned in report of Council.



P.M.	Leasehold Bill.  Att.G. to reply to debate.  H.M. to open.

		(This Bill doesn’t cover Scotland.)

			Xmas Recess:  15th Dec. to 23rd Jan.



E.Sh.	Opposn may ask for Defence Debate before Recess.  We aren’t ready

		on Germany because NATO discns procdg.



P.M.	They have had enough debates on Defence.  Resist this demand.





	2.	Durham County Council – Closed Shop.



E.Sh.	Motion re Durham Co. Council action – by Tories.

	Shd. not there have bn. consultn with Council before M/H. &amp; M/E.

		made their declaration.  It caused Councillors to dig in toes.

		Made it an issue betwn. Council &amp; Govt.

	Cd. not M/H. &amp; M/Ed. still have consultns with repves of Council – to

		avoid trouble with Tories or, worse, split w’in Durham Labour.



A.B.	Cdn’t have stalled.  Was asked in Parlt. for a statement.

		Real ques:  will they enforce resoln?  Resolns have bn. passed 

		before, by other Councils, but not enforced.

	Was going to see wtr. unoffl. talks cd. be promoted.  But I cdn’t

		equivocate.



E.Sh.	Compromise isn’t impossible.



A.B.	I won’t yield an inch.  Public body can’t be allowed to co-erce private

		citizens in this way.  Someone shd. teach Durham a lesson.



H.D.	Somethg. must be done to bring reason into Council minds.



H.M.	In Parlt. Ministers must take firm stand – clear cut.



W.W.	Will see at week-end what cd. be done to get Council into more

		reasonable frame of mind.



A.B.	Ready to join in informal talks.

	3.	Korea.



E.B.	Intelligence fr. Indian sources:  Ch. armies are strong, with big

		reserves in M’churia.  Looks serious.

	Developmt:  movement of R. bombers into M’churia.  U.S. are 

		considerg. this &amp; I’m in touch.  Shan’t announce.

	In addn to suggns re more troops, apprecn of whole sitn shd. be drawn up

		for W’ton:  political as well as military:  to get U.S. minds clear.

	Shall have to face ques. of re-inforcing U.N. troops.



P.M.	We can’t afford to send more - &amp; get bogged down in F/East.



E.B.	At this stage, only want to get authority to ask C.O.S. &amp; Dpts to

		prepare full appreciation, covering whole area.  Take assumption

		tht. we are at war – for purpose of co-ordinatg. intelligence.



H.G.	Any indicns of R. moves elsewhere than in F/East?



E.B.	Some signs of movement of troops in Poland &amp; twds. E. Germany.

		Rumours only.

	Mtg. in W’ton of friendly Govts. y’day:  many favoured our idea of

		demilit. zone n. of the waist.

	Tels. sent y’day re 6-Power resolns, urging no addns re aggression.

		Recd reply tht. U.S. will not press for amendmt of 6 Power 

		resoln or to name China as aggressor.

	Mustn’t have troops drawn away fr. Europe.

	Must force France to a decision on organn of defence.  Lost 8 wks.

		already, since W’ton mtg. of N.A.T.O. Council.

	Not happy re pace of re-armament in U.K., of defensive organn with

		Europe.  We must prevent 3rd War.



E.Sh.	C.O.S. can appreciate on basis of informn available:  but action does

		not lie in their hands.  We can only represent thro’ Tedder to

		U.S. C.O.S.  And latter have little influence with State Dpt. or

		MacArthur.  Our problem:  effective co-ordinn betwn. U.K. &amp;

		U.S. C.O.S., so tht. our influence can be effective.



E.B.	What I want is a forward look, pol. as well as mil., fr. Korea outwds.

		This is a new situation.  Havg. faced it, pol. as well as mil.,

		I want to put it to U.S. as co-ordinated document representg. all

		parts of U.K. view:  and demand reply from all sides of U.S.

		adminn thro’ Franks.  Separate approaches will not reach 

		co-ordinated end in W’ton.



H.W.	Raw materials will limit re-armament unless somethg. is done 

		v. quickly.



P.M.	Must be put to U.S. Govt.



E.B.	I want to put whole picture to U.S. – covering prodn, raw materials

		and the whole story – what is needed if we are to go into war.



E.Sh.	Will P.M. give a genl. direction to Dpts telling them what

		they are to do re appreciation.		Agreed.



H.G.	Combined intell. apprecn – defence &amp; prodn.

		What positive steps must be taken now v. risk of worse 

		things coming upon us – incldg. Joint Boards etc.



E.B.	Must know what liabilities we can undertake before U.N. resolution re 	China come to a vote.

	I doubt, Europe being as it is, wtr. U.K. ought to accept any further 	commitment in F/East.

	Must at least get U.S. commitmt e.g. on raw materials tht. they will 	facilitate our re-armament etc.

				[Enter  C.O.S., Barnes.

				  Stevenson.

				[Exit  W.W.

	4.	Egypt.



E.B.	Don’t believe E. Govr. will yield.  King is now powerless.  For 

		Minister’s attitude (cf. speech at So’ton) is v. stiff.  I see no hope

		of agreement save on basis of w’drawal.

	My line therefore – there is Treaty:  ready to consider any proposals or

		widen confn M/E.  But, if yours is just a blank refusal, we stand

		on Treaty.  Not getting out until it expires.



P.M.	Then they can say we have 20.000 troops above Treaty limits.

		If it goes to U.N. we shall be in diffy over this.



E.B.	Why have we kept Mauritians there?



E.Sh.	8.000 – guards on depots.  Combatant troops don’t exceed Treaty

		limits.



E.B.	Also we have failed to train Eg. Army acc. to Treaty.  Another

		awkward point if we are taken to U.N.



H.McN.	Why shdn’t adminve troops be reduced?



P.M.	Because of stores.



E.Sh.	Def. policy hasn’t vacillated.  C.O.S. favoured Egypt as permanent

		base – even when Ministers favoured Cyrenaica.  But no

		settlement cd. be reached with Egypt.

	Tried to solve depot problem by buildg. in E. Africa.  Tho’ decided

		not to go on with it after £5 m. spent – presumably a Ty. decn.

	If we are to run down E. base, where else do we go in M/East?

		Tobruk is filthy hole.  Bengazi:  but we are being edged out by

		local politicians.  Cd. build cantonment higher up in Jebel –

		100/150 miles beyond Bengazi:  and wd. cost £20/30 m. and take

		10 years to complete.

	Cd. put a few more in Cyprus.  Cd. keep what we have in Tripoli.

	x	Cd. try to get facilities fr. Israel.     x

	But all this is long-term.  M’while we must remain in Egypt.

		Means:  run down troops to Treaty limits:  find other place for

		depot.



C.I.G.S.	Mauritians used in depot because cheaper.

	Most successful operns of E. troops = raids on our depots.



H.G.	Mtg. with For. Minister on sterling balances y’day.

		They demanded complete convertibility.  Extreme breach.

		But they want to go on talking.



P.M.	No alternative but to carry on with existg. “policy”.



	Passage through Canal.



B.	We are being increasingly embarrassed, in shipping.



Att.G.	Para. 24 of memo. summarises legal posn.  Subject to this:  the further

		we get away fr. Armistice, the less right Eg. has to interfere with

		normal traffic.  We cd. now take line tht., war with Israel being

		over, it’s unnecessary for their security to place restns on traffic

		thro’ Canal.

	We cd. now take a stronger line.  We are on firmer ground on this 

		than on Sudan or Treaty of ‘36.



H.McN.	We cd. say no tanks if they say no tankers because state of war.



B.	I will send particulars of incidents to F.O. &amp; Att. Genl.



E.B.	Sub judice now because with Security Council.



	Supply of Arms.



E.B.	Awkward consequences because Tripartite decln means equal

		treatment for all.  And wd. H/C. support me in bargaining 

		Canal and supply/arms.



H.McN.	We have in past supplied arms &amp; accepted interference with Canal.

	I suppose H/C. will force us to stop arms to E. so long as E. Govt.

		want to push our troops out of Eg.



E.B.	H/C. pressure wasn’t related to Treaty or Canal?



H.M.	It was:  they quoted hostile attitude of E. as a ground.

	If you got reasonable accommn with E., H/C. wd. be easy re arms.



E.B.	A bit deeper than that.  If I send arms to E., they will find another

		reason to object.  (It is the pro-Israel group that is at bottom 

		of this.)



E.Sh.	Real trouble in H/C. is tht. we shdn’t be exporting arms when we 

		haven’t enough for ourselves.  That is Oppn line.  And if we

		resume supplies to E., we must do same for e.g. Syria.



	Treaty (resumed).



P.M.	We are in breach of Treaty – no. of troops, location, failure to train

		Eg. Army.



C.I.G.S.	Art. 8. Annex stipulates nos.  Our forces don’t exceed 10.000 + nos.

		necessary ancillaries for adminve &amp; techn. duties.



H.McN.	38.000 in all.  Docs “ancillaries” apply to R.A.F. only or both?



J.	Both, as matter of construction.

	And are all your non-combat troops employed on “admin. &amp; techn.

		duties”.  Guard duties aren’t that.



C.I.G.S.	17.000 combat troops.  Brigade group.

	What we want is peace-time base large enough to support big

		Forces in war.



E.B.	If that’s what you want, we cd. get a deal – base in peace, with

		limited no. of guards &amp; technicians in plain clothes.  They

		accept war needs:  it’s infringement of sovereignty in peace.



	Sudan.



Att.G.	Legal posn is diff.  Sovereignty does rest in Egypt.  We weren’t

		entitled to alter Sud. constitn w’out E. agreement.



J.	Yes.  But we must stand firm.



G.W.	On 2nd memo. I shd. have some points to raise:  if ever it came up.



	Cyrenaica.



H.McN.	When memo. on Cyrenaica comes to Cab., can we have informn of

		no. of installns etc. we have.



E.B.	Will make it joint memo.	[Exit  C.O.S., B., Att.G.

				[Enter  M.W.

	

	5.	Meat.



	[ Not heard …..]

H.G.	Favour para. 11(a).  Dangerous to make a small ration cut – they might

		assume we are on the run.



H.M.	V. awkward date to start it – Xmas.

	If we do this, let’s put the blame squarely on Argentine.  And also

		tell them at once they won’t get any coal.



H.W.	We tried double bluff:  and it’s failed.

	Won’t this big cut in rations also fail.  Show Argentines how much 

		we depend on them and strengthen their stand.

	I favour 11(b).



M.W.	V. serious risk.  Our stocks are so low.



A.B.	V. serious position – politically because Xmas, and materially 

		because winter needs.



H.McN.	Commend stiff line recommended by H.M.  They don’t understand

		any other line.



E.B.	You won’t frighten them by a bluff on coal.

	They are earning dollars for hides and wool.  They can’t stand out

		v. us on sterling.

	Don’t take H.M.’s line w’out examination.  Cut coal exports but

		don’t try to use it as threat.



P.M.	Put in 4d of corned meat until January.	Agreed.



E.B.	Cd. we not find some meat from U.S.?



H.G.	Told M/F. dollars cd. be found for this.



M.W.	Cd. get 20.000 tons of meat fr. U.S. in a few weeks.



P.M.	Get it – quick.		      [Exit  H.G.



M.W.	No freight.



E.B.	Use ship’s stores, as we do in war.  Make M/T. do it.

					      [Exit  M.W.



	6.	Utility Wool Blankets.



H.W.	Symptomatic of consequences of raw material shortage.

		Comes with smaller lag because blankets = short-term prodn 

		&amp; large wool content.

	Wool has now risen to 147d – 9½ times pre-war price.

	Only way of stabilising c/living will be re-introdn of subsidies on

		clothing.  Otherwise, fair shares will be imperilled – rationg.

		won’t secure them.  Can’t decide that in advance of general 

		review of fiscal posn by Ch/Exch.

	M’while we can only raise price of blackest.



G.A.I.	19 on c/living index.



H.W.	Much greater psychological effect.



A.	Publicity – showg. it’s not Govt.’s fault.



H.W.	It wd. suffice for me to tell manufactr’s what their price wd. be –

		&amp; delay announcg. retail price.





	7.	Nepal.



E.B.	Have sent Dening to Delhi.  Urging delay.



G.W.	More chance now of gaining time.

		Nehru’s correction of his speech.
