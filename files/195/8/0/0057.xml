C.M. 3(51).				15th January, 1951.



	1.	Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.



P.M.	Procdgs. v. harmonious.  Tricky at times.  Reasonable proposals

		on Korea whatever result.

	Kashmir:  talks were unfruitful.  Points of disagreemt. narrowed,

		but no concln.  L.A.K. was reasonable (E.Sh. On defence also.)



H.D.	Decln well received by U.K. public opinion.



P.M.	Hope some advantage in U.S. also.





	2.	Defence Preparations.



P.M.	As in brief.  Time-table.

	Presentn  a) reasons for acceleration  b) its economic effect.

		Suggd these can be done separately – but I doubt it.

		I wd. have liked a single statement before Parlt. met.



H.M.	Public opinion – not Labour opinion only – is disturbed:  some

		anti-American strands in it:  has 2 problems on wh. guidance

		is needed  i) worry about threat of war:  avoiding looking it in the

		face:  doubt as to who is to blame, some criticism of U.S.  They

		need convincing of facts of R.’s activities:  but also tht. we wd.

		seek a peaceful settlement if opportunity offered by R.  Must

		start from basis of what is best means of preventg. war.  Explain

		sitn:  make them face it:  &amp; convince them we are not seekg. war.

		ii) disposn to think tht. defence need have no effect on social 

		policy &amp; well-being.  Labour must be made to understand tht.

		this can’t be.

	I had hoped P.M. cd. spk. before Parlt. met, e.g. in his constituency.

With advance hand-out of 2.000 words.  Reason:  don’t want it made in Parlt, because then reported together with Opposn

		comments.  A White Paper, prs., as alternative.  Or make it

		outside Parlt., even after Parlt. has met – tho’ Opposn wdn’t 

		like that.



H.D.	Cd. not P.M. do it this coming week-end.

	White Paper wd. not be suitable.



A.B.	Cd. Cab. be told, before country is told, what we are going to do.

		What are the figures?  Leaks in Press.



H.G.	These leaks are damaging.

	Support L.P.  Speech next week-end to prepare public mind.

		No need to go into details at this stage.

	Answer the criticism:  is re-arming going to do any good?

		Get across our posn vis-à-vis Russia.  Need for re-arming,

		regardless of scale &amp; effect.



A.B.	Can you separate the two?  Must tell people what impact will be.

		Otherwise, produce scare – w’out realisation of what we shall

		call on people to do.

	We have never agreed on £3.6., in detail, now U.S. have declined to

		give the £500.  P.M. has said we shall have to forego increased

                  y/		advantages we might have expected:  no-one has said we shall

		have to give anything up.



H.G.	Posn is tht. £3.6 is going ahead:  &amp; we have since agreed to announce,

		at Brussels, we were considering acceleration.  Def. Cttee have 

		not considered that since.



P.M.	I have spoken in genl. terms.  Can’t do so again, w’out details.

	Doubt if we can yet say what econ. implicns wd. be.

	I might hang a speech on Comm. decln – object to prevent war:  action

		on F/E.:  mtg. of C.F.M.:  m’while look to our defences.

		But then shd. have to say somethg. re scale – critical of U.S. &amp;

		also awkward w’out decns on figures.



A.B.	Wd. be matched with U.S. extravagant plans.

	Excessive publicity for Eisenhower.

	Wd. provoke more talk of Coalition.

	Before we spk., we must know economic impact - &amp; esp. wtr. it will

		come in 6 months or earlier.



H.M.         x/	Begun already – prices, raw materials.

	Public expect guidance &amp; leadership.

	Pity detail isn’t ready:  but not too early to begin to prepare public

		for it.

	Surely it cd. be hung on peg of Comm. decln.



                 x/	diffies are not due to our re-armament, but to U.S.

	Our plans &amp; impact can’t be announced this wk-end.



H.G.	Agree:  you can’t spk. on that until Cab. decns taken.

	But I think there is preliminary clearing of ground  to be done.

		Repeat E.Sh. disclosures re no. of  R. divns under arms.

		Repeat no. of spots at wh. we are under pressure – e.g. Malaya.



E.Sh.	…..	Favour speech by P.M.  B’cast.  Not in his constituency.

	He cd. say  i) Adopted £3.6 p’mme.  Are now revising it in light of

		change in world situation – notably the fact tht. R. continues to

		re-arm, on a vast scale.  Their posn is far stronger than any other

		country.  Producg. aircraft at 300 p. month.  Re-organising war

		potential of Hungary, Rumania &amp; Czecho.

	Don’t like U.S. attitude.  But, in view of our defenceless posn in west,

		we must not antagonise them.  We can’t afford to.  We need

		U.S. troops in Europe.  We shd. steady opinion on that point

		too.

	Shall have to present Suppl. Estimates soon.  Genl. defence debate

		on that.  Another on next year’s Estimates in Feb.  Let P.M.

		begin to prepare the way for those debates.



T.W.	If such statement is to be made, it must be followed by another

		explaing. impact on our economy &amp; on policies of civil Dpts.

		Ch/Ex. askg. for economies wh. cut into policy as well as adminn.

		Shall have to announce these publicly in reln to defence needs.



J.G.	Betwn. now &amp; Sunday we shall know China’s answer on Korea.  And

		that will be dominant in people’s mind.  Suppose it comes on

		eve of P.M.’s speech.  Might be wrong moment for such a

		speech.

	If it were not for that, I wd. be disposed to favour a speech.



P.M.	Impressed by that.



H.McN.	Unfortunate P.M. can’t give details.  But still desirable to say 

		somethg.  Two months ago public were expectg. us to say this

		more than now.  M’while, high hopes over Korea &amp; our

		steadying of U.S. policy has made people more optimistic.

		Even if Ch. gives fav. answer, wise to check wishful thinking.

		If they reject, say this is only one point in world sitn wh. requires

		preparedness.

	Wd. prefer a b’cast.

	Share H.D.’s fears re Germany.  Public are concerned at G. re-armg.



P.M.	How diff. to deal with that – when it’s a card for C.F.M. &amp; we don’t

		know how we shall want to play it.  Yet, if I say nil. on that,

		it will be thght. to be significant.



C.E.	Effect of our speeches on W. Europe.  Went to C.D. course for

		Europeans on day after Taft’s speech.  W. Europ. in view of that		were discarding hope of Em. defence.

	Handicapped by policy of avoidg. scare over C.D.  I said:  we put

		active defence first &amp; mean to fight as far east as possible;  &amp; 		plan c.d. mainly to support morale of troops.

	Depn from C.I. askg. for evacuation in war.  Told them too we were		going to fight as far east as poss.

	Necessary to state our determinn to stand fast.

	But cost!  All earlier figures are unrealistic.  C.D. - £137 m. in 4 years:

		revised estimate, on prices only, prob. 50% higher. 

		M.S. - £750 m. plan for shelter.  When that comes home in 

		W. Eur., what effect will it have?  If any steadying influence is

		to be applied, we shall have to do it.

	Wd. prefer one speech – later.



P.M.	So wd. I.  I don’t want to suggest war is inevitable.



A.B.	Dissent from E.Sh. analysis.

	Military always exaggerate strength of potential enemy.

	R. can no doubt give more of her steel prodn to defence.

		But I believe R. is not putting main reliance on military

		coup.

	R.’s game is to force us to re-arm on a scale wh. will embitter our

		people v. democratic control.

	All we need therefore is enough mil. strength to ensure tht. we aren’t

		knocked out in 1st blow.  For they can’t win a long war.

	Don’t believe R. is formidable mil. power.  Stories of their mil. 

		strength is schoolboy nonsense.  My informn is tht. R.

		bureaucracy has failed to organise prodn.

	Concln.  We dare not put such strains on our economy &amp;

		developmt overseas as to give R. their opportunity.

	P.M. has bn. wise.  P.M.M. has bn. remarkably successful.  It’s

		decln = historic.  And has given us moral leadership of world.

		For P.M. to spk. now as proposed wd. undo all the good that

		has done.

	Suggn tht. country is askg. for leadership echoes D. Express.  This

		atmosphere is created by enemies of the Party.

	Diffy over U.S.  They have never had our experience of m’taing.

		army in peace.  They arm for war:  disarm in peace.  If we can’t

		restrain them, they will drag us into war.  I won’t travel that road.

	If H.G. comes to M/H. and asks for cut in Nat. Health Service, I won’t

		accept it.  Revert to y/.  Can’t have atmosphere created by public

		speeches wh. wd. prejudge that posn.



A.	Still favour P.M. speaking this wk-end.  Peg = P.M.M. &amp; its decln.

		To induce mood of sanity.

	Avoid detail.  But sympathise with some of A.B.’s case.  What is our

		defence p’mme for.  W’out knowg. that, can’t assess economic

		impact.

	State cause of re-armament frankly.  Not Korea or China, but Europe.

		Don’t believe R. can support vast Armies suggd on her steel

		prodn.

	Make a balanced statement before Parlt. meets.



J.	Support A.’s view.

	Not as b’cast.  For not precise enough for b’cast method.

		Speech in P.M.’s constituency.



H.W.	Strong case for speech on P.M.M. in its own right.  Wd. m’tain

		moral leadership.  Cd. take up generally some of r. materials

		ques. – P.M.M. discns &amp; W’ton announcemt.

	Danger – reply “so what?” unless you promise further statemt. in

		Parlt.



G.A.I.	Support H.W.  Means a second speech soon afterwds.

	Therefore Cab. shd. know somethg. re p’mme this week, so tht.

		other Ministers can answer ques.

G.T.	Leadership sometimes consists in being quiet.  P.M. has done 

		enough to make our policy clear.  Against makg. a speech.



P.M.	V. diff. to judge from this discn what content or tone of speech shd. 		be.

	Main work of P.M.M. was Korea.  Cd. follow up approach made to

		that problem.  Say it applies elsewhere.  And end: but if worse		comes, we must be ready for it.  But that isn’t a call to 

		sacrifice.  It’s more hopeful.

	If, however, I refer to R. danger:  I imply preparg. for war &amp; putting		country on war footing.



H.D.	Former is line:  ending with need to be strong in case worse happens.



H.G.	You cd. go beyond decln &amp; give some insight into P.M.M. mtgs.

	Cab. decn of 18/12 (to accelerate) hasn’t bn. made very clear in U.K.		Tho’ disclosed at Brussels.

	Cd. promise details when Parlt. meets.



P.M.	Want to know decns taken before I give that promise.

			{   I will defer decision, for a day or two,

			{   until I see what Chinese response is.

					     [Enter Att.G. &amp;

					      Wheatley

	3.	Order 1305.



Att.G.	[ Not heard.]



H.G.	Shd. not revoke at present.

	Amendmt.  I favour only (b).



A.B.	P’pone considn until we know implicns of re-armament.



J.G.	Desirable to keep Order going in some form.

	Easy for Comm. leadership to get men out.  If * Kemsley decn		enables them to use it – T.U.C. will decide next time tht. Order		shd. go.  And M/L. then pledged to end it, if one side asks for

		its revocation.  *i.e. if held tht. M/L. has no discretion &amp; unoffl.		Comm. leaders are enabled to get to arbitn. (?)



G.A.I.	Wd. like to canvass views on J.C.C. – especially if we prefer to delay		final decision.



P.M.	Throw it open:  or put proposals?



G.A.I.	Throw it open for genl. discussion.



Att.G.	On p. 3(c) in M/L. memo.  Is if meant tht. prohibn of unoffl. strike 

		to continue.  Diff. to forbid them to go to arbitn &amp; at same			time prohibit them to strike.

G.A.I.	Diff:  for don’t want order swamped by multitude of small applns.

		Want T.U. views on that ques.



			Agreed:  get general views of J.C.C.

				           [Exit  L.O.’s

				           [Enter  N.B.

	4.	Coal Economy Measures.



N.B.           	i)	Want b’castg. to be considered together with load-shedding

		proposals – by L.P. Cttee or Prodn Cttee.

                   	ii)	Summertime.  Propose 8 weeks’ extension.  Sitn much worse.

		Prodn 1.6 m. above highest expectn.  But some power stations

		are now below 2 wks. stock.  Domestic consumers:  shopkeepers

		industry – all bearing heavy sacrifices.



P.M.	Weather has improved.  Thght. gap was small – due to lack of 

		normal autumn increase.



N.B.	Appeals have brght. prodn up to level of 1949/50.  But we needed

		an increase.  Open-cast is being lost because weather.

	Imports – 250.000 vice 350.000 hoped in Jan.  May get 1 m. in all,

		vice 1.6 m.



H.G.	M/T. never promised more than 250.000 in Jan.



T.W.	M/F &amp; P. spks. in terms of m. tons.  Saving fr. summertime 

		proposal is v. problematical.  Doesn’t start until end/Mar.

		Pol. diffies in Parlt.

	In 1950 we had 3 wks’ extension.  Now asked for 8 weeks.

		More coal will be used by people sittg. up later, because 

		lighter.  This won’t help this winter at all:  &amp; only 1 week in

		next winter.  Pol. black-eye for no results.



H.McN.	Supported T.W.



A.	Also supported.



J.	Start it immediately before Easter.



H.G.	Coal posn will be difficult in Mar. &amp; Apl.

	Favour compromise.



C.E.	Will be diff. to get any extension thro’ Parlt.  Agricult. members will

		be hard to convince.



P.M.	Is it worth while?



A.B.	Don’t think it is.



C.E.	Ready to ask Parlt. to agree to 3 weeks’ extension.



P.M.	A small &amp; hypothetical saving wh. you can’t get Parlt. to accept.



			Agreed:  only 3 weeks’ extension.



	i)	Broadcasting.  (resumed)



H.M.	Direct saving 90 t. p.d.  Indirect, about 60 t. p.d. (thro’ earlier

		retiring to bed).



A.	Pin-prick.





	iii)	Mid-Week Sport.



N.B.	Offl. Cttee recommended no mid-week sport – football or racing.

	C.E. doesn’t want to touch racing.

	I propose limiting this to football.



C.E.	No figures can be produced in support of this.  F.A. will ask you to

		prove your case.



H.W.	Only 30 matches to play.  Only 10 draws are likely.  Few mining

		teams are left in.  Only 3 re-plays in those areas.  If Cup

		replays are on Satys, League replays will have to be on 

		wk-days &amp; there will be more of them.



H.McN.	In w. Scotland, mid-week games do draw huge crowds.  And

		miners in Lanark don’t like it.  Valuable psychol. effect of

		announcg. no mid-week Cup replays &amp; later will consider

		mid-wk. racing.



J.G.	St Leger on Saty vice Wed. wd. save more coal than any football

		interference.



T.W.	Doncaster Council, if asked now, wd agree to Saty for Leger.

		But don’t exaggerate saving of coal.

		And doesn’t happen until next Sept.



A.B.	Don’t do this on basis of coal only.  Wait &amp; see if we have to do it

		for defence prepns generally.



			Agreed  a)  no interference with mid-week sport 

			                   on basis of coal only.

			              b)  put St Leger on Saty - &amp; take it up early

			                   in the spring.



H.M.	Is N.C.B. giving enough attentn to managerial side of problem.



				         [Exit  J.G.

					[Enter  H.H.M.

					

	5.	Supplementary Pensions Schemes.



H.M.	Cab. agreed it shd. be limited to underground workers.  Public

		statement gives no precision to that.
