C.M. 52(50)							                 1st August 1950



		1.	Korea. Security Council.		[Enter K.Y., Att.G., H.G.



K.Y.	U.S. had wished to submit unfortunate resoln.  We rode them off.

	At 7.30 pm. last night we heard of a new one – i) condemning N. Koreans for defiance of U.N.  ii) Callg. on all to continue resistance of this defiance.  iii) Callg. on all to avoid action tending to spread area of conflict.

	We saw no advantage in pushg. this in before Malik’s arrival.  Weaker repetn of earlier resolns on ii) and i) : and iii) wd. give opening to Malik to attack U.S.

	We therefore advised delay.  But U.S. went on with it.  Ques. now will be wthr. this gets precedence over Malik’s Agenda.  That was presumably object of manoeuvre.





		2.	Security Council: Admission of Chinese Communist 				Representation.



K.Y.	We have told U.S. tht. if R. raise this on merits, and not as part of bargain over Korea, tht. it wd. be diff. for us to do more than abstain. Indeed we may feel obliged to vote in favour.



P.M.	We shd. not be put in posn of voting for Nationalist Chinaman.  Wd. be wrong in principle and awkward qua Asia.

	Nor shd. we take line tht. this can’t be settled until Korea is pacified.

	That wd. be no more reasonable than R. attitude tht. it must be settled before Korea is discussed.  The conditional point of view is wrong either way.



A.	Weak attitude to wait until we know there’s going to be a majority.

	Cdn’t we take a definite line.



K.Y.	Didn’t want to offend U.S. opinion unnecessarily by a vote wh. wasn’t going to be effective.  But we’ve m’tained that line for 6 mos. and to go over now to a more positive line wd. provoke U.S.  opinion.



H.McN.	We have taken positive steps – oil, ships, men – to keep U.S. with us.

	Unrealistic to alienate them over a thing like this.  Much political advantage in adhering to our policy.



P.M.	No argument for doing everything U.S. wants, even when we think they are wrong.

	Dangers of Europ/Asiatic line up over this – emotionally v. dangerous.

	Esp. on a point like this – Comm. Govt. is the effective Govt.



R.S.C.	And U.S. have said they will accept majority view on Security Council.



A.V.A.	Has anything come of our recognition?  Ambassadors not exchanged.



K.Y.	Their complaints weren’t framed as condns of exchanging dipl. repves.

	Nor have we promised to vote for their admission – unless it’s clear there will be a majority.



A.V.A.	Don’t let’s make any change of policy.



P.M.	Looking ahead to situations that may arise.



A.V.A.	Abstain from voting – safer course.



P.M.	Our guiding principle must be to avoid driving China into the arms of Moscow.



R.S.C.        x/	As U.S. have said they will be bound by majority,  x/ it is our duty to express our opinion by a positive vote.  If everyone abstained, an expn of view cd. not be secured.



P.M.	Agree: if it comes up on its merits, we must vote in favour of admn.



K.Y.	They have never said x/ to us.  Only to Indians.



R.S.C.	It was published.



P.M.	Avoidance of alienatg. Asia is fundamental to us.



H.McN.	If Korean resoln can be taken first, our dilemma wd. be eased.  For if R. are reasonable about Korea, we can easily vote for China: And if they aren’t and walk out the China resoln won’t arise.



R.S.C.	Our repves must receive firm instructions.



K.Y.	E.B.’s view was tht. they shd. ask for adjournment before voting, even on this China issue.  We must see how it arises.



P.M.	Yes: but useful for E.B. to know genl. views of Cab. viz., we shd. not be put in a posn in wh. we appear to vote v. adminn of China: don’t want it to be part of a bargain: don’t want to look weak by waiting to see how others will vote.





		3.	Convention on Human Rights.



K.Y.	Convention must be adopted – we couldn’t oppose it in principle.

	Further amendmt. won’t get us anything better than this draft.

	The European Court is based on optional clause: we don’t need to be bound by it.



P.M.	Will this be a paid body?  Watch that.

K.Y.	Art. 23.



R.S.C.	This Convention makes a planned economy impossible.  Eg. inspection of premises.  Arts. 4, 5, 8, 13. Policy twds. Communists in Civil Service wd. also be barred.



P.M.	All the Greeks etc. will vote for it, even tho’ they won’t carry it out.

	We shall look v. foolish if we vote v. it.



H.M.	Is Council/Europe the right place for this sort of thing.  Tories wd. enjoy supportg. somethg. embarrassing to “planning” Govts.



A.V.A.	I was briefed by F.O. to stall on this in E.C.O.S.O.C.

	Can we take an opposite line at Strasbourg.



R.S.C.	This Convn wd. enable U.K. co. to object at this court to a planning Reg.



Att.G.	Policy of workg. for a Convention has gone on too long to reverse it now.

	This draft follows what U.K. repves proposed.

	We cd. meet R.S.C.’s view by small amendment of Art. 8.

	All these Conventns will be apt to be out of tune with letter of municipal law.  Enough if consistent with genl. principle and substance of our law.



J.	Opposed to that view.  We shall be jockeyed into accepting the court – wh. administers no known law but only generalities – and overriding our courts and our legislature.

	We shd. be surrendering to the Commn and the Court control over our law.

	No pol. advantage.  For Russians and others won’t pay the slightest attention to Convention and we shall feel obliged to.



J.G .	Political diffy. is tht. we shall have to oppose it in public in Assembly. Hope therefore we may take opportunity of seeking amendments in the Council of Ministers, in private. Esp. Art. 23.

	Parallel Convention under discn in U.N.  That restricts right of petition to States.  If this is carried in C/Europe same principle may be inserted in U.N. draft.

	Urge therefore omission of Art. 23. or at least its modification.



K.Y.	But can we go back on genl. policy of support for a Convention.



H.M.	We can either	a) say that havg. seen the draft we don’t like it.

			b) U.N. are doing one: no sense in having two.



R.S.C.	How come we to put fwd. such a draft as this – inconsistent with planned economy.



K.Y.	Don’t accept that it does.



P.M.  	Take the line tht. U.N. shd. do this, and C/Europe shd. leave it alone.



H.McN.	We cd. have said that a year ago – and didn’t.  What new reason for saying it now.  Only hope is to try to reduce it to a declaration.  Or kill it by a 1.000 cuts at particular provisions – eg. Art. 23 and Court.



P.M.	Are you going to have a Commn.



Att.G.	There’s bn. a declaration already.  Too late for that line.

	We have agreed to go ahead with Conventn.

	If we oppose it now, we shall be alone with the Greeks.

                   x/	Best line wd. be to stall on this, on drafting grounds.

	M’while let J. explain the legal diffies to Maxwell Fyfe.



K.Y.	Cab. shd. realise it will be seen, at Assembly stage, tht. we have made volte face.



	Agreed as at x/.



R.S.C.	Can we have a memo. showg. how this came about.



P.M.	Yes.  Shdn’t anyway have come up so late.



							                  [Exit Att.G.

								                  [Enter G.S.

		4.	Defence Requirements and U.S. Assistance.



R.S.C.	Point for Cab. decn how far are we prepd to go in committg. ourselves to expenditure on defence over next 3 years or so, both with and w’out U.S. help.

	Explained para. 4.  Increased labour on munitions of ¼ m. 

	In para. 5 we have put our views on U.S. help.

	The £900 m. takes a/c of about £30 m. for increased pay – otherwise only figures decided by Cabinet.

	How much wd. we be ready to spend in this crisis, assumg. we are not going to destroy our economy?  We believe: £170 m. (para. 6(ii) as a maximum.  Addl prodn over and above that can be undertaken only with U.S. help – wh. shd. be given (para. 7) in free dollars.

	For most will fall on engineering industry and must involve redn in exports (eg. of cars) and we must increase our dollar reserves as against deficit this incurred in sterling.



E.Sh.	No detailed examn of requirements.  Annex II hasn’t bn. vetted by M/D.

	No a/c taken of increased costs and new weapons.

	Calculations in para. 4 assume current expre at £780 constant.  In fact, on existg. policy, expre wd. rise (eg. for Korean operations, rising costs etc.,)

	Includes C.D. expenditure at £90 m. Didn’t expect it wd. be so included.



R.S.C.	V. stupid to omit it because showg. U.S. how much we have to spend.



E.Sh.	1951/52 gives us £900 m.  



R.S.C.  	No: £1075. Of which, we cd. carry £950 m.



E.Sh.	Figure of what we require is too low.



A.V.A.	First line at 780 m. doesn’t take a/c of rising cost of existg. policy.



R.S.C.	We can indicate to U.S. tht. our expre (requiremts) may be higher.

	In particular, we weren’t ready to put in estimates for personnel tho’ U.S. asked for them.  But £950 m. is all we can pay for.



A.B.	V. serious.  Means increased taxn or decreased social expenditure.

	The social and pol. offensive v. Communism is to give place to the military offensive.  You regard R.’s military threat as more grave than the other.  I disagree.  U.S. are wrong: and so are we in followg. them.

	If this is approved, civil Ministers will be in a clamp.  Can only accept redns in our p’mmes.  Only freedom will be to decide which of our social p’mmes shall suffer first or most.

	Tories will like to see us do this.

	I disagree and must carry my disagreement to last point.

	Better way: build up economic standards.  Democracy is function of capital accumulation.

	We cd. prob. stand this p’mme.  But doubt if France or Italy could. And means tht. we shall deny ourselves the chance of helping them to resist Commn by increased social and economic standards.  Dissent from this fundamental re-orientn of our post-war policy.



H.M.	My fear is tht. this isn’t the last of it.  Believe there may have to be more expenditure.



P.M.	Adjustment is not a reversal of policy.

	Loss of Malaya wd. be a much greater blow to social standards.

	It’s a ques. of balance – accordg. to events.

	If M/H. found a huge disease epidemic in U.K. he would have to ask for more money to meet it.



E.Sh.	Have never had adequate discn of defence – in Cabinet – since election.



P.M.	Idle to suggest tht. internatl condns haven’t deteriorated.

	Public realise tht. they have.

	Fact tht. French etc, have spent less on defence doesn’t mean they have done better in resistg. Communism.

	We can’t afford not to do at least what is proposed here.



E.Sh.	We are totally unprepared for emergency.  A.V.A. never got the money.

	But we have no right to order men into battle w’out proper equipment. Mistakes doubtless were made – in disposals etc. – because we didn’t expect this early emergency.

	Posn in W. Europe can’t be worse.  Allies don’t act.  Only hope is to show an example.

	Choice for us: spend much more on defence or chuck our hand in.



R.S.C.	Two aspects: money and production.

	Prodn total = 1075 m. 1951/52.  Some we expect, in dollars or gold, fr. U.S.  But transfer to defence prodn will be betwn. 950 and 1075.  At 1.000 m., say, it means 200 m. more than this year – Some off exports (U.S. paying).  Some off. home investment.  And prs. some off consumption.

	On this basis, on % of national income, our defence expre will be v. much the same as that of U.S.



A.B.	Concerned at para. 10.

	Shd. we not say our existg. expre on social services and investment is fixed: we offer the product of increased productivity.



R.S.C.	That wd. be much larger.  £300 m. or more.

	And we have pledged it already for non-defence expenditure: increased Govt. expre and capital investment.



A.B.	Memo. implies redn in existg. standards.



R.S.C.	No.  We have planned increases.  More Govt. expenditure: rise in earnings: increased capital investment.  We may have to p’pone the improvement.



A.B.	I’m ready to concede tht. Defence has prior claim on increment in productivity.  Believe we can m’tain existg. standards plus the automatic eg. addl. o.a. pensioners.



R.S.C.	Our p’mmes (eg. capital investmts) are expanding p’mmes.

	We shall have to cut back the expansion.

	Can’t yet say exactly how p’mme wd. affect us – esp. before we know precisely what the production is.



P.M.	What impact will this make on U.S.?



H.G.	a)  same percentage of national income.

	b) total over 4 years = £1100 m. : 50% from U.S. surplus over 780.

	c) decided not to base demand on estimated loss of exports.

	But U.S. element in this wd. cover dollar cost of addl dollar imports and compensn for loss of exports.  Takes care of b/paymts. posn.

	If we tried to do more, b/paymts. posn wd. suffer.



A.B.	We have bn. doing more than U.S. up to now.



R.S.C.	U.S. have now increased her defence expre.



A.B.	We haven’t got a relative b/sheet of natl expns on defence.



H.G.	We must give a lead.  Emphasise percentage of natl income approach. Canada’s eg. is v. low.



J.	This looks to me to be on small side.

	If your def. expre is inadequate it’s all wasted.



E.Sh.	Ours is ok – save for my point on the first 780 line.



G.S.	P’mme will make considble impact on some industries.



A.B.	Watch inflationary effects.

	Memo. approved.				[Exit K.Y.

							[Enter M.W.



		5.	Capital Investment.



A.B.	Political consequences of refusg. sewage schemes to small rural areas.





		6.	Nationalisation of Water Supplies.



P.M.	Much difference of opinion.  This must stand over until after holidays.





		7.	Call up of Reservists.



A.B.	Ty. have decided tht. reservists called up shall have balance of pay made up.

	And said tht. N.H. Service may do same.



P.M.	R.S.C. shd. enquire into this.
