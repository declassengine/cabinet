C.M. 13(51).				12th February, 1951.



	1.	Korea.                                 [Enter  C.O.S., K.Y., Ogmore, Strang.                               				                                   

K.Y.	We advised caution (to U.S.) &amp; recd re-assuring replies fr. State Dpt.

		&amp; Bradley.  We now seek a more formal assurance.  Para. 4.

	But this a.m.’s Press says S. Koreans have crossed 38th Parallel.

	Draw attentn to 6(4).  Alternatives are v. grave.



C.N.S.	Militarily, may be necessary to deviate a little from 38th.  Both on

		a line.  And in tactical opns may have to counter-attack across

		38th:  also bomb beyond it.

	Must hold in Korea.  U.S. thinkg. of w’drawg. S. Koreans &amp;

		re-equipping them.



P.M.	Can’t go into 6(4) to-day.  The rest of recommns seem sound.



H.G.	Public statement re 38th?  You may be pressed.  If you cd say we

		aren’t going beyond, it wd. re-assure public.



P.M.	I’m inclined to say tht. it’s our view tht. it wd. be unwise to go beyond

		line of 38th subject to such adjustments as tactical sitn may

		require.	General agreement.



E.Sh.	Make it clear tht. it’s U.N., not U.S., business.

	Inadequate contact betwn. MacA.’s H.Q. &amp; Govts of U.N. Forces.



C.A.S.	U.S. C.O.S. are keeping us in touch with their views.



O.	Inform Doms.	Agreed.





	2.	Defence in Pacific.



K.Y.	….. paras. 4-5 summarise Dulles’ views.

	Para. 4 d-f = our strongest objns.

	Tels. fr. W’ton 418, 419 suggest U.S. may be thinkg. better of 

		Dulles’ plan.   Suggn of 3-Power Pact:  we are seekg.

		elucidn:  no ques. of final decns on that to-day.



P.M.	Does this island chain include Formosa?  May be a trap to get 

		A. &amp; N.Z. support for U.S. claim to that.

	Most unsatisf. to us.  Omission of H. Kong, Malaya &amp; Indo China

		won’t suit us.



J.G.	Agreed.



A.B.	A mere formula to exclude us.  No sound strategy in it.

		We cdn’t be indifferent to a war in wh. A. &amp; N.Z. were engaged.

 

H.M.	U.S. rushing this.  Case for study-group includg. U.K.



A.V.A.	Stress McIntosh comment on para. 3 of W’ton 418.  A. are

		lookg. for means of limiting their liabilities in advance.

		Doubtful re Menzies.



P.M.	Are you right.  When here, M. was stout in A.’s part in M/E.



C.A.S.	Pacific = U.S. commitment:  M/E. = Commonwealth.

		A. &amp; N.Z. reluctant to commit themselves in M/E. before knowg.

		U.S. intentns in Pacific.

	Real need is simple U.S. guarantee of security of A. &amp; N.Z.  They cd.

		give it, on basis of sea-power.  Then A. &amp; N.Z. wd. be ready to 

		talk turkey on M/E.



P.M.	We must resist this U.S. plan.



K.Y.	In reply to H.M., there will be chance for more formal discn when

		Dulles gets back to W’ton.



H.M.cN.	Island chain conceptn is politically disastrous.

	But don’t rush into opposn.  A. &amp; N.Z. anxious for some guarantee.

	Dulles is 1st word not last.  We shall have plenty of chances to 

		get this right.



			Agreed:  seek to check this in limine.



				[Exit  C.O.S. &amp; Ogmore

				[Enter  H.

	3.	Meeting of C.F.M.



K.Y.	Soviet evidently want a limited agenda:  but there are some openings.

	Alternative in 7, somewhat stiff &amp; not recommended.

	Prefer proposals in 8 &amp; 9.

	Later informn:  W’ton telegram.  U.S. want to propose tht. offls. shd.

		prepare agenda incldg. at least – causes existg. tension in

		Europe incldg. level of armaments:  sitn in S.E. Europe: 

		Austria:  problems affectg. Germany:  genl. relations.  And

		have power to settle order.  But understandg. in advance tht.

		these subjects shall be on agenda.

	We think this goes too far:  let reply be more general:  reserve that 

		detail for mtg. of offls.

	French also want more precision because they fear b’down of offls

		mtg. unless made clear tht. we shall insist on wider agenda.  On

		that, we still prefer our approach.



P.M.	Exclude para. 7. because we want a mtg.		Agreed.

	I shall say in H/C. to-day we want a mtg:  but G. disarmament is

		not only ques. to discuss.

	In reply to R. make it clear tht. we shall want a wider agenda, but

		don’t be too stiff.



H.M.	Jessup’s formula O.K. save for last phrase?



H.G.	I think so, too.



W.S.	Doubt re competence of C.F.M.  First para. refers to peace-settlements.

		And R. regards those words as decisive.  Even “other matters”

		(later in t. of r.) is covered by opening clause.



H.G.	All U.S. items cd. be brght. under “peace-settlements” formula:

		except the last, wh. in any event is v. vague &amp; useless.



H.McN.	Don’t think R. wd. accept first or last item as w’in CFM. t. of r.



H.D.	Prefer paras 8 &amp; 9.  Put them on spot by firm suggn for place &amp;

		date of mtg.  Indicate agenda v. generally.



K.Y.	As at x/ in para. 9.  That’s enough to safeguard our posn.

		Want more time to discuss specific agenda.



			Approved:  paras. 8-9 plan.





	4.	Call-up of Agricultural Workers.



A.B.	Met last week.  On basis tht. Cab. had decided in principle to remove

		protn &amp; we had only to discuss means &amp; timing.

	First point at issue:  as in memo.

	Second point:  remote areas as well as small farms.  But adminve

		discretion not hardship tribunals.

	Third:  timing of announcemt.  Must get ahead, to let men know

		where they stand.

	Generally:  15.000 in all fr. industry employg. nearly 1 m. can’t

		involve real diffy for the industry.



T.W.	Want Cab. to re-open whole ques.  Three objns:

		i)	15.000 p.a. = 80.000 over 5 years.  Wd they all be called

			up in war?  If not, why waste money on training them.

		ii)	End 49 to end 50 lost 20.000 fr. industry.  Wastage 

			serious, esp. to new industrial undertakgs.  



P.M.	Are they going from small farms or large?



T.W.		ii) contd. 15.500 Eur. workers, whom we can’t keep on farms.

			Tho’ admit there is at moment a balance of labour in 

			agric.

		iii)	Meat debate.  Is this the moment to do anything to

			weaken agriculture.



P.M.	Defence comes 2nd to agric., acc. to you.  You allow men to drift out

		of agric. to less essential industry:  but want to stop them going

		into Forces.



T.W.	Control of Engagement, if Cab. ready for it.



P.M.	You haven’t proposed it.



T.W.	But I don’t want to ban volunteering fr. farms to Forces.



A.B.	Argument at i) is fallacious:  wd. apply to all reserved occupns.

		Must have reserve of trained men:  &amp; decide on strategy at time.

		What propn are to be called-up.



E.Sh.	N.S. Act ends in ’54. (?)  Only 45.000 to be called up in all.

		Not 80.000.

	Real argument:  how can you justify leavg. these men in agric. at a

		time when we are takg. exceptional steps re reservists.

	Thght. timing was main diffy:  we met tht. by avoidg. call-up in

		planting &amp; harvesting seasons.



H.McN.	We do make exceptions.  We have done so re coal-mining.

	We are criticised for exceptl measures helping agric. – e.g. emplt. of

		school-children.  For we have prodn targets to meet.



A.	A.B.’s concessions help:  but is the gain worth the pol. trouble.



H.M.	I have sympathy with agric. pt. of view.



H.G.	Exemptn for coal-mining because coal shortage now.  That’s the diffce.

	I support A.B. on the ques. of principle.

		But on the detail.   a)  Defer call-up until autumn.  For we don’t

			                           get many men before.

			                      b)  By adminn.

			                      c)  Wd. not be diff. if announcemt. was on

			                            basis of a).

	Make that amount of concession because pol. diffy of iii) in T.W.’s

		speech.



A.V.A.	High propn of old men in agric.  This wd. increase their costs.

	Support A.B. on principle:  but must have some sugar on pill.



E.Sh.	Diff., under H.G.’s (a), for Services to absorb 15.000 fr. Nov. onwds.

		Too many in short remaing. period.  3/4.000 only in 1st period

		can’t hurt agric. &amp; wd. spread load on Services.



P.M.	That argument cuts both ways.



H.M.	Pol. advantages of a) are decisive in my view.  Services must accept

		inconveniences.

E.Sh.	Let’s accept principle &amp; invite T.W. to discuss with industry how it 

		cd. most conveniently be applied.



A.B.	Don’t take all political odium &amp; get no men for Services.

	If you p’pone until after harvest, Services can’t get 15.000.

                  x|	But then you needn’t announce at once, anythg. but decn of 

                    |		principles tht. protn is going to be w’drawn.



E.Sh.	Can’t then give figure of N.S. call-up this year.



T.W.	I wd. accept x/.



			Agreed:  as at x/.



				[Enter  Att.G.

	5.	War Crimes.



K.Y.	As in memo.

	Powers of clemency have bn. delegated.

	Public misgivings caused v. largely by timing.  i) K.’s statement

		ii) McCloy’s independent action re Krupp etc.  iii) G. re-

		armament.

	On i).  D. Herald was inaccurate.  Not a speech:  replies to ques.

		by Press-men.  F.O. Intell. was not wholly accurate:  went out

		before we had K.’s report:  tho’ diffces are not in fact v. serious.

		Form of statemt. was unfortunate:  “hatred &amp; revenge” unhappy

		words to use, but in context did not refer to Nuremburg court.

		He meant tht. he in his review wd. not be so actuated.



A.V.A.	Views of “Germans”.  Are we being advised fr. Berlin about a repve

		cross-section of G. views.  Para. 10.



H.M.	Same point.



H.D.	The people we like in G. aren’t pressing for release of these criminals.



K.Y.	Repns mainly fr. church-leaders.



J.	Have seen K.  i) He admits his choice of words was unfortunate.

		No intn to imply “revenge” as motive of Judges in any trial.

		He meant these words to apply to his review.

			     ii) McCloy’s hand was forced.  He had a body of

		Judges fr. U.S. &amp; had to accept their recommns.  K. was not 

		consulted on merits of decn re Krupp.

			    iii) Responsibility for clemency has bn. delegated to K.

		He can’t therefore avoid reviewg. on basis of repns recd – even

		tho’ Genl. Wade made a review only 18 months ago.  He will,

		however, keep now in mind climate of opinion in U.K.



Att.G.	I’m not opposg. G. re-armament.  Merely juxtaposn of this &amp; release

		of Nazis e.g. Krupp.  Even tho’ it was U.S. error, F.O. shd. have

		taken initiative to stop it.

	K. has also said “no case he won’t review”.  Surprised tht. he shd. 

		e.g. Manstein.  “changed circs”… I see none.

		“hatred &amp; revenge”  I still think we must refer to some courts.

	Wade’s review:  v. careful and good.  Recent.  No case for a general

		review.



H.M.	V. serious view – both on merits &amp; on our Parly. diffies.

		Offls. must remember they serve H.M.G.

	U.S. consulted K. on Krupp.  K. must have known U.S. were about

		to release him.  He shd. have warned F.O.

	Two reasons for Party uproar:-  a) or B. offl. out of control.

		b) impn tht. sympath. consn is to be given to release of Nazis 		convd of serious crimes.

	Can’t leave this where it lies.



P.M.	K. has bn. given delegated responsibility to review.  On that he is 

		not officer of H.M.G.



H.M.	Surely he shd. seek guidance on cases involvg. pol. considns.

	Anyhow:  I think K. must be sacked:  &amp; P.M. must say so to-day.



K.Y.	Read terms of delegn to H.C:  mitigate or remit penalties etc.

		There was a specific delegation.



Att.G.	Why promise to “review”?



P.M.	That doesn’t promise “mitigation”.



E.Sh.	Respons. transferred to F.O.  Before that W.O. consulted F.O.



H.D.	How came it tht. K. came into posn tht. he is to decide these pol.

		ques. w’out refce to F.O.  On all other matters he wd. refer

		home for guidance.  Surely, there must be a mistake.  He ought

		at least to have checked up with F.O.



P.M.	When did F.O. realise tht. K. took this view of his responsibility?



K.Y.	He hasn’t done anything yet.



W.S.	I believe K. has bn. given this responsibility.  I don’t think he shd.

		have bn. given it.



H.McN.	Douglas was instructed, on a capital sentence, to refer home on a 

		case where pol. consns were involved.



A.B.	The words are clear.  E.B. gave K. that responsibility.  He shd. not 

		have done so.

	W’draw this delegn of powers, and say so.  Before he acts.

		Don’t make K. a scapegoat.



H.	Responsibility tranfd to F.O., who at once delegated it to Robertson.



H.M.	Revise terms of delegn vice w’drawg. it.



P.M.	Para. 5 of C.P. 38.  Were those cases decided in G., or referred to 

		F.O. or what?



K.Y.	Doubt if they were referred to F.O. – certainly not to Ministers.



Att.G.	Anyway:  this doesn’t excuse what K. said re Nuremburg cases.



K.Y.	K. has asked to be relieved of these delegated powers.



P.M.	E.B. made the delegation:  wd. like to know why:  also wd. like to

		know by whom they wd. be exercised in future:  before the 

		powers are w’drawn.



H.G.	Decision re K. must rest with P.M.

	But	a)  what does P.M. say to-day.

		b)  shd. we not approach U.S.  Their words &amp; actions are much

			more damaging than K.’s.



K.Y.	Don’t rush into saying delegn will be w’drawn.  Will suggest we

		shall settle in future solely on basis of political considns.



C.E.	Nature of jurisdn – personal, not political.  I don’t refer to my

		colleagues ………..
