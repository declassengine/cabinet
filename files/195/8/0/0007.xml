C.M. 33(50)							22nd May 1950



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter W.W.



H.M.	Business for week after Recess.

					[Exit W.W. Enter Serv. Ministers.



		2.	Deserters.



E.Sh.	Up before, not qua amnesty – rather on treatment on re-capture.

	But raised in Parlt.  Further enquiry made.  C.O.S. strongly opposed to amnesty on principle, as is First Lord.  Other Ministers and one P.P.O. think tht. as many are on the run and time elapsed, some leniency might be allowed.  Whole no. is not v. large.  But amnesty is to apply only to non-regular element in total no.  Nor is it to apply to any deserter guilty of any crime of turpitude (? the person of the crime). 7.800 only concerned therefore. 



	Considered applyg. it only to those desertg. durg. war.  Rejected because nos. who contd to serve post war.   Date chosen therefore was 1.1.47.  Admit this isn’t logical and will perpetuate some anomalies. But does it act as deterrent to w’hold amnesty?  Evce is tht. it doesn’t.



	Consns against.

	Arguments evenly balanced.  My concln: threat of punishmt. is no value to Services.  Amnesty after 1st war. 



P.M. 	But no conscriptn in peace after 1st war.



H.	Proposed, under amnesty, to discharge – and not require them to serve remaing. time.

	For us, this is a ques. of principle and discipline.

	Nos wd. be small.  For ⅓ men servg. regular agreements.  Response to earlier concessions has bn. small.  As it was in 1922 – when 170 p. month arrests fell to 140 p. month surrenders after announcemt. of amnesty.  Small response wd. make breach of principle unwarranted.



A.H.	A.M.P. strongly in favour.  Doesn’t think it wd. prejudice discipline.

	I agree with that view.  1922 amnesty didn’t prejudice R.A.F. discipline.

	Over last 5 years, large nos. deserted in 1947, 48: but sharp drop in ’49 – to ⅓ of ’48. Our problem is easing off.



P.M.	What will you do 2 yrs. hence if desertions continue?



E.Sh.	Amnesty isn’t to apply to regulars.



P.M.	Are you to say “this is the last time”?



E.Sh.	This is a post-war clean up.   

H.M. 	But extends to Jan. ’47.



E.Sh.	All of those nearly must have begun to serve during war.



A.V.A.	About 200.000 must have bn. called up betwn. 1945 and 1947.



M.St.	Answered adjournment some 12 months ago.  May be awkward to justify change of policy – no danger of circs.  Indeed, more diff. to do this now because of impending service of N.S. men.



P.M.	If some had hung on longer they wd. have avoided penalties they have served.



A.V.A.	Memo. is illogical.

	After 1st war, no peace-time conscriptn.  The 3 Dom. countries who gave amnesty don’t have conscription.

	We are now havg. to send conscripts to potential battle areas.  What encouragement to these men to desert.



	Opposed to amnesty.



A.B.	Wd. census next year find some of these out?



P.M.	This wd. benefit worst elements – who have misbehaved in war and in civil life.  Cuts at whole roots of our society.  Least good citizens are to benefit.  Better men gave themselves up and took their punishment.



J.	Make desertion in war seem less serious than desertion in peace.

	Earlier concession makes it worse.  You call on people then to come fwd. and take (lenient) punishment.  How can you now offer complete amnesty to those who hadn’t decency to come forward then.



H.D.	Effect on T.A.  Stress view of C.I.G.S.

	No. is much smaller than suggested.  Many Irish.  Don’t compromise principle for so small a number.



C.E.	Police deny tht. deserters are responsible for high propn of crime.

	Differentiatg. betwn. regular and conscript wd. also be undesirable.



E.Sh.	I disagree with C.I.G.S. v. T.A.



	Agreed: no change in existg. policy.

				

							[Exit Service Ministers

		3.	Summer Prices for Coal.		[Enter B., N.B., H.G.

	

N.B.	Graduated summer prices.  Not always as much as 5/= differential.

	5/= is only 3d. a cwt.

	Propaganda.  Much last year. Yet summer sales were record low.



H.W.	This small incentive is unlikely to make much difference.

	For whole country is getting short of money: and won’t use it on things not needed until winter.



E.B.	Supported lower summer prices – essential to efficiency of coal distribution system.



T.W.	Neither price nor publicity alone will suffice.  We must do both.



A.B.	Can’t change behaviour of altering prices.



E.B.	Consumer who stocks in summer is providg. industry with storage.

	Not unreasonable to pay somethg. for it.

	Makes for smoother turn-round of wagons in winter.  Merchants must not store in wagons.

	Insurance tht. those who can’t stock will get supplies in hard winter.



B.	All transport consns favour M/F. &amp; P. proposal.

	Must get back to pre-war habits.



P.M.	Rebate to people willing to stock, at their charge.



E.B.	Clean coal is more important than money.



R.S.C.	Trouble when price goes up in November.



H.M.	Choice of politically awkward courses.

	If we were sure of breakdown in supplies, we shd. have no hesitn in acceptg. differential price.  Figures on p.1. are serious – getting worse. Need for full explanation as well, now and in autumn.

	Driven, on balance, to favour M/F. &amp; P. proposal.



H.McN.	N.C.B. and merchants have interest in stimulatg. summer sales.  But no case yet for view tht. cost be borne by poor who can’t stock.



E.Sh.	Present this as winter price and summer price.  Not as increased price.

	Answer to H.McN. : ordinary operation of economics.  People who buy when demand is low can buy more cheaply. 



H.McN.  	But we have a public responsibility for coal.



G.T.	You must relax restrictns on delivery.



P.M.	That is a corollary.  Must allow consumer to buy more of his year’s requiremts. in summer.



N.B.	Daren’t do that until supply is increased.



H.G.	Combine price diff. with maximum relaxn of restns on deliveries.

	My diffy. : how much do you expect to achieve?  Figures on p.1. influenced by weather.  Also coal wasn’t available for summer sales in ’49 : not more than ½ m. tons.  Is that worth all political diffy. of price differential?

	But it’s N.B.’s responsibility : let him do what he wants.



A.		At least a step in right direction.  To assume supplies to Londoners in a 		hard winter, esp. those who can’t stock.  Shortage of coal will hurt far 		more than 3d. a cwt.



			Proposal approved – on understanding tht. N.C.P.s

			will take positive steps to ensure supplies to those

			who can’t stock.



			Announcemt. needn’t be by Govt.  The trade can

			handle it.

			

							[Exit B., N.B. &amp; H.G.

		4.	Scottish Affairs.



H.McN.	Amended terms of reference.  Shd. last para. be included?



H.M.		I proposed this addition. If Cttee find this practicable, there will be 			demand for annual return in connn with Budget.



		Thght it preferable to allow Cttee to produce the informn (furnished by 		Dpts.) 	once ad hoc, and avoid risk of annual return.



R.S.C.		Diffy. – political decn will be requd, on ques. wthr. return shd. be 			made, even if Cttee decided it was practicable.

	

		Suppose they decide it is practicable, with enormous trouble and work 		for industry etc. wthr. it is worth while, tho’ practicable, is a political 		decision.



H.M.		If Cttee find it practicable, cd. you resist demand for the informn



R.S.C.		You might eg. if it involved much work for firms under (c).



			Agreed : Omit para. 2.



A.B.		If you have such a Cttee to pacify Scottish nationalists, you will have 		to do it for Wales also.  Propose tht. Cttee be extended at once to cover 		Wales.



R.S.C.		Scotland is diff. in this respect fr. Wales.  Expce eg. is separately

                   x/  ascertainable because of Scottish Dpts.



		There will be pressure.  We can meet it by saying tht. if it is found 			practicable for Scotland we will consider doing the same for Wales.

A.B.		That line of excuse at x/ wd. support claim for 5 yrs. for Wales.

		Must have my view on record.  I have consistently opposed this sort of 		thing in Wales.  My opposn to W. nationalism will be undermined by 		this.



H.M.		Diffce betwn. AB., and some of our supporters.  I and some colleagues 		take a middle view.  Extreme opposn to nationalism may not be right or 		wise.



		Agitation in Wales isn’t so great as in Scotland.



H.D.		This wd. be salutary effect on silly nationalism.



		Memo. approved.        A.B. dissenting.		[Exit R.S.C.
