C.M. 63(50)							               9th October 1950



		1.	Socialised Industries: Supplementary Pensions.



						           [Enter N.B., B., E.S., H.H.M. D.J.



H.M.	Summarised memo.  Awkward attitude of T.U.C.

	Burden on Boards.  Electricity and gas might manage it because they have much on these lines.  But miners, steel and road transport wd. be new.  And then private industry.

	Yet T.U.C. support claim tht. Unions shd. be free to negotiate it.

	Want to get facts establd by a Cttee and many of existg. schemes are insolvent.

	T.U.C. regard that as evasive: preferred quick Dpl. enquiry.

	We propose to go on with Cttee but give Unions and Bds. right to negotiate and promise to consider results on their merits (of the particular case).



E.S.	Support H.M.

	On composn of Cttee – shd. be people outside Dpts.  For recommns shd. carry weight with workers and public opinion.



H.H.M.	Effect of Cttee on pensions.  Wd. increase demand for Sel. Cttee on war pensions.

	In last Parlt., despite 3-line whip, 3 Govt. supports voted v. us.

	Interests are now urging Dpl. Cttee not Sel. Cttee.  I don’t favour that. But Service pay increases have wakened it up: and this wd. add fuel to the fire.  Br. Legion may now support the demand.  No logical connn but sentimental one.  Will be argued tht. Labour Govt. is more sympathetic to industrial workers than to war pensioners.



D.J.	Agree to H.M.’s proposal.



N.B.	Pre-war, publ. utilities tied men to industry by these schemes.  This policy succeeded.  With full emplt. their posn is more diff.

	First gas strike in history.



B.	Cttee shd. meet as soon as poss., fr. my pt. of view.

	I have to tell B.T.C. tht. new entrants shan’t come under existg. schemes.  Haven’t done so yet.  If we say negotns can start. diff. to keep out new entrants.



J.G.	Vice new Cttee cd. you seek advice of existg. Cttee under N.I. Act. Might avoid H.H.M.’s diffy. T. of R. might have to be adjusted. Wd. give same authorisation voice.



H.M.	Wd. like to consider this helpful suggn.



E.S.	My Cttee are names not known to public.



J.G.	But are known to T.U.’s.



H.D.	And are likely to be more responsible.



N.B.	T.U.’s didn’t want to be represented on the ad hoc Cttee.



H.M.	They prob. wd. w’draw that opposn if right to negotiate is conceded.



G.A.I.	Agree with H.M.  And favour J.G.’s suggn.



E.B.	Does it cover private industry?  



H.M. 	Yes.



						[Exit H.H.M., E.S., B., D.J.,

						[Enter Att.G.

		2.	Gas Strike.



G.A.I.	Gas industry proposed to suspend the 10 men on full pay, while on bail.

	Men will be allowed to return to work.  But Union will be asked why they shd. work or be suspended on full pay – option.

	Troops held until this pm. – to be ready if more trouble.

	T. Williamson represtg. producers) has bn. firm and steadied his men.

	Men sentenced.  Shown tht. law can be enforced.  Need prosecution press for penalty, on appeal. 



E.B. 	Don’t discuss that in Cabinet.

	This was organised move.

	Some Union didn’t give up the help we needed.  Confedn passed it all on to its Ldn. District, dominated by Comm. Berridge.  He sabotaged attempts to get mtg. of men.  A.E.U. never urged its members to return to work.  E.T.U. sheltered behind Confedn and did v. little.  Line was: “Comms. got them out, let Comms. get them back”.  



E.B. 	Did Unions pay?  



G.A.I. 	No.  But they cd. have taken stronger line in condemning unoffl. strike.



P.M.	Criticisms tht. Govt. shd. have acted sooner.

	We deferred to M/L. advice.  But might have cracked down quicker.



N.B.	Danger of spreading the strike.  Bds. feared that. T. Wmson’s Union did v. well.  Got many groups back before end and helped to change opinion among the men.



H.M.	Did Wmson. share Bd’s fear re extendg. strike.  Acc. to my informn he didn’t.  Was he consulted on that point, as well as Bd?

C.E.	As soon as Council w’drew their fears, procdgs. were begun.  At the earlier stages they were v. apprehensive.  And if their fears had proved to be justified, Services cdn’t have handled situation.

	We had to take that into a/c.



Att.G.	We ought to move more quickly in future – if not procdgs., at least calling in troops.  Wd. have bn. better to put troops in earlier.

	In any discn in Parlt. we shd. make it clear tht. Berridge has bn. double-crossing.  When instructed by superiors to urge men to return to work, he in fact did opposite.  And fact tht. he employs man sentenced to 6 yrs. pr. in 1946 for selling military secrets to Russia. [Glading.]

	Police think procdgs. helped to get men back.

	Comm. campaign (started in Hyde Park y’day) will be continued until hearing of appeal.  And will put Q. Sessions in position in wh. they can do nothg. but confirm sentences.  This is clearly contempt of court. Nervous of consequences.



E.Sh.	If you quote Berridge in H/C., you’ll be asked to say what you are going to do.



Att.G.	Can point to diffce betwn. knowledge and legal evce.



J.	Wish we cd. prosecute ringleaders as such for incitement.  Instead of charging them only with striking.



Att.G.	Lack of evce of incitement.  Tho’ we selected for prosn the members of Strike Cttee. 



E.B.	Order 1305.  Many undertakgs. given before it was made, in order to secure T.U.C. agreement.  Many Unions now favour its repeal – and Comms. are cashing in on that feeling.

	Att.G. shd. be made aware of the undertakings.

	Can’t prosecute for breach of contract w’out fresh legisln. 



Att.G.	Wd. like some modern legn on the subject.

	But while Order 1305 is there, I can’t continually neglect to enforce it.



E.B.	A.E.U. always slow to take firm line.  Executive elected by ballot.

	Some members always nervous of re-election.



N.B.	That factor has come into play this time.



Att.G.	I want to see references in H/C. to Union mtgs., Berridge’s activities and existence of Glading.



P.M.	Get Gas Board to take sensible line about suspension with full pay.

	M/F and P. to take this up with Bd.     Agreed.



E.B.	Fresh legn  Apart from 1927 Act, never bn. legn w’out public enquiry. And we made a point of that [when repealing 1927 Act.] or [in Parly discn of 1927 Bill?]



H.M.	Might be good thing to have such an enquiry.



E.B.	On limited issue eg. breach of contract, then might be agreement.



C.E.	I like the idea of enquiry.

							[Exit N.B. Enter H.



		3.	Foreign Affairs.



E.B.	Will try later to put in comprehensive report.  But some urgent aspects to wh. I must draw immediate attentn.

	At our N.A.T.O. mtg. in Ldn. in May, our main task was to convince U.S. tht. Europe cdn’t again hold the fort until U.S. came along. Everyone wd. have to be in fr. 1st day.  Betwn. then and Council mtg. in N. York, U.S. and Canada have bn. faced up to that.  I was thrown out in this by W.S.C’s resoln at Strasbourg.  For European Army wd. leave out U.S. and Canada: and Europe wd. be in posn for askg. for their aid.



	U.S. offer to put troops in Europe: to help with navy and air force: to give financial aid.  She has accepted full responsibility for sharing in defence/Europe.  But she realises we must fight as far east as poss. – i.e. on German soil.  Then what is her role?  Conclusion (with which I agree) no alternative but for G. to provide units in integrated Army for defence/Europe.

	France stood out v. that., on principle.  Maybe she is moving a bit, if Schuman’s speech of y’day is Fr. Govt. policy.  German participn in defence must be related to progress of Fr. re-armament.



	Discn then re G. Police force, wh. might be used in emergency.

	This brings us into conflict with G. Soc. Dem. Party.  They won’t have it.  They insist tht. external defence must be open and above board and linked with Europ. defence forces.  They will support police – but press police for internal order only – and army for external defence.



	Timing.  France won’t accept any re-arming of G. until the Europ. defence forces are in being on the ground.

	But time is on wing.  Hence draft telegram to Paris: handed round.



J.	Put a point on paras. 4 and 5.		                     [Exit H.M. &amp; G.A.I.



P.M.	But Genl. Staff and training organisation wd. be called into being by this.  That is the danger.



E.Sh.	Who is to command these G. units – brigade or battn.

	If they can create force up to a divn  it must have logistic backing.

	Fr. have objected to principle of creation of G. units.

	Schuman suggd delay of 9 months, to study the matter.

	In my discns with Moch and Pleven, they have always promised to consider this as and when provision and equipment of Europ. forces proceeds.  So Schuman’s statement of y’day is nothg. new.



	At mtg. of 3 Def. Ministers., Marshall produced memo. by U.S. C.O.S. It began: we can’t create G. Army now.  Went on to armed Police (Moch accepted): labour units: adminve backg.: defence works.

	Moch accepted all save creation of G. armed units.

	Whole ques. is one of timing.  Cdn’t force Fr. now to accept principle.

	But if we convince them first tht. we are bldg. up, they will come round.



	Para. 4. of draft. Accept argument.  But if we can’t get anything more,

                  x/	wd. it be wise to reject this?



	Also, if we fear gendarmerie comg. under G. control, same applies to G. armed units. Para. 4 argument inconsistent with para. 5.

	N.A.T.O. Defence Cttee meets on 25/10.  Must make practical progress.



	We must table our contns, all of us.  Must make a start.  No one but U.K. has done anything, save talk.  Idle for French to talk of 10/15 Divns when no equipment for them, and unwilling even to extend period of n. service.



E.B.	Need for speed on G. army ques.  For risk tht. U.S. will w’draw their offer.

	

	Trouble = weakness of Fr. Socialists, who won’t take a firm line.

	Paris telegram of 8/10 reportg. conversn with Parodi.

	This draft telegram to Paris shd. represent Govt. policy.

	Esp. as it is being suggested tht. on this I am at variance with some of my Cab. colleagues.  Sandys is putting this sort of thing about.



	Let Harvey take this up politically, while M/D. talks to Moch.

	On para. 4 point. x/ Police force alone wdn’t give us enough.

	Also we are in diffy. in handling Germans over this.  Tel. 1468 from Warnerheide.  Avoid imposing decn on G. or even putting a request to them – merely ask if they are ready to make a contribution.

	Relaxation of control over Germany.  Have gone a long way.

	Defence obligns must be accepted in return for these concessions.



		General line of draft telegram approved.

		Subject to	i) considn of detail by M/D.

				ii) review of para. 4.

				iii) on para. 5. might it help French if

                                     H.D.		brigade rather than divn was upper

                            (suggn only.)	limit.



E.Sh.	May be better to make no refce to 	                        [Re-enter H.M.

	size of “units”: stick to “units”, w’out definition.
