C.M. 64(50)							             16th October 1950



		1.	Overseas Operations (Security of Forces) Bill.

									  [Enter 6 invitees.



P.M.	Is this a good time.  No occasion for it.  Wd. provoke enquiries v. wider issue.



H.M.	Wd. have liked to do it.  But admit we have missed the bus.

	Keep it ready and introduce if a good occasion arises.



C.E.	Agree.



J.	Get it cut and dried, however – includg. discns with T.U.C.



G.A.I.	Agree – includg. T.U.C.



A.B.	Don’t discuss with T.U.C. – leakage – until occasion arises.  Agreed.



C.E.	P.Q.’s re Daily Worker.  No powers to act.  Shall say No.

	P.Q. by W. Smithers.  Shall also reply No.



A.V.A.	Will be debate in Address on genl. ques. of Commn threat.



		Agreed:  Exclude this Bill from King’s Speech.





		2.	Legislation Limiting Rights to Strike.



P.M.	Your (a) seems best runner.  p.2. of C.P. 229.



H.M.	Legisn on (b) wd. be controversial.

	Ballot – (c) cdn’t be done w’out public enquiry.

	Ques.: do we have enquiry.  If not, (a) is best line – coupled with civil procdgs. by Boards.  Perhaps explore the second half and also have an enquiry.



Att.G.	I prefer the idea of a ballot.

	Course a) wd. mean more prosecutions, wh. I don’t favour.

	Course b): Order will fall for renewal at end/year.  So long as contd it will become more use for me to enforce it because of prosn wh. I took v. gas strikers.  If it is to be renewed, I think it shd. go on statute book.



	Don’t want a) alone: because puts too much emphasis on crim. procdgs.

	On civil procdgs. urge line indicated in C.P. 224.



P.M.	Is ballot practicable?  Short stoppages.



A.B.	Unoffl. strike takes place in hot blood.  You wd. still have diffy. of enforcemt. when no ballot has occurred.

	I favour C.P. 224 – preceded by publicity letting the men know, eg. leaflets.  Shd. be discussed with T.U.C.



C.E.	If ballot went in favour of strike, moral posn of strikes wd. be stronger than now.



T.W.	Lightning strikes – every man wd. be liable to penalty.  Tho’ often solution is found in 24 hrs.



G.A.I.	Can’t take ballot in unoffl. strike. who wd. take it?

	On offl. strikes we have toyed with idea of discn with T.U.C.  But have held off because of suggn of public enquiry.

	Can you always trust Union to take charge of ballot.

	At present there are on average 6 strikes a day.  Most are sudden stoppages and on most occasions Union offls. get them back.

	Order 1305.  Remains in force until Govt. take initiative to repeal.

	So far both sides have wanted it retained.  Unions want one or two minor changes – so do we.  Might discuss with T.U.C. what they want.

	Havg. prosecuted under it, we can’t have it in background.



E.B.	If men comply with 1305, what can you do?



Att.G.	But it’s absolute prohibn of any strike, offl. or unoffl. – unless M/L. decides not to refer to arbitn.



E.B.	I don’t urge enquiry legn.  I only said don’t legisl. w’out one.



P.M.	Not good time for enquiry – Tories out to raise points on Union structure.



N.B.	Against c)

	On a): little to be done to increase security/tenure.

	Considerg. leaflets to workers.

	Wd. like to consult T.U.C. on whole ques.

	On C.P. 224.	i)  wrong to make natd indies do this and not private 		industry.

			ii) test shd. be essential public service: and steel not 		coal comes under that.  And food does.



Att.G.	Don’t want to limit it to natl  indies.   Want to show good example.



Wh.	a) Where do you draw the line on what is essential.

	b) We can operate this.  Most practical of the three.

	c) Not practicable.  How define area of ballot.

	On C.P. 224.  Long drawn out procdg.  Strikers cd. get legal aid in Scotland.  Incident forgotten by time damages awarded.



P.M.	Found in practice to be useful deterrent.

	Must find something effective for serious cases.



E.B.	Doubt if Order 1305 can go on in peace.  Amounts to compuls. arbitn and T.U.’s never believed men wd. conform.  That is first thing for M/L. to face.

	If you can’t have compuls. arbitn can you make an arbitn system readily available wh. will attract the men.

	Compuls. arbitn works only in Comm. countries when strikes are prohibited.

	Cd. we promote arbitn machinery attd to Trade Councils via one central arbitn court.  Steel, boot trade, have developed this to a high pitch. Hoped same thing wd. evolve in mining round Porter Award machinery.  Tedious job: but prob. only way out.

	But enforcement in courts is broken reed.  Can’t act until strike has gone on for some time.



P.M.	I favour discn on this line – first with T.U.C. and thereafter with employers.



G.A.I.	Accept that.  May be need for public enquiry later.



H.M.	Swedish model might also be considered.  There is a central body there; and that enables the general econ. sitn to be taken into a/c.

	Dangers of de-centralisation of machinery for settling wages etc.



G.T.	Full emplt. has altered condns for T.U. work.  We must think out functions of T. Unionism in new society.  Not surprised T.U.’s accept Order 1305 in this sort of peace.

	What is function of T.U. now – esp. in natd industries.  That is what we ought to be considering.



H.McN.	But now we are concerned with limited ques. what action we can take to check “conspiratorial” strikes.  Don’t favour talking to T.U.C. on that ques. esp. as it will be discussed in H/C.

	What are we prepd to do?  Eg. to have crim. procdgs. in a natd industry.

	Not to take criminal procdgs.

	No approach to T.U.C. w’out specific proposals.  Cd. we have a memo. on this.



A.B.	Small Cttee under M/L. to make concrete proposals of what we are to put to T.U.C.  Wages policy in public sector: need for some machinery.



P.M.	Must be ready by Debate on Address. 

 

E.B.  	Also Cttee of officials.

	{	Scope : a)	Strikes – on lines of C.P. 224.

	{		b)	Long-term improvemts. in structure for wages 

	{			settlement.

	{	Of these, a) must come back to Cab. before Debate on Address.

	{		    b) can be taken more slowly.

	Cabinet Cttee Ministerial and official, side by side.



						        [Exit 4 Socialising Ministers

		3.	Mr J.G. MacManaway.		     [Enter W.W.



H.M.	As in memo.

	Shd. Whips be on?  Bad if H/C. ignored Judicial Cttee opinion.  Needs considn.

	Bill of Indemnity.  Wd. look spiteful if we excluded his vote on the Steel Bill decision.  Bill shd. extend up to next mtg. of Parlt. (resumption after adjournment).



C.E.	Para. 1 of memo. assumes tht. I will present this orally.

	Privy Council have followed precedent of Samuel case, when L.P. was in H/L.  The Judicial Cttee is only a Cttee of the Privy Council, over which L.P. presides.  L.P. shd. have done this.  But as Judicial Cttee have ordered me to do it, I will.  Tho’ I needn’t present it orally: can merely hand it in.

	Have arranged for it to be in H/C. late Tues. evening.

	Leadbitter shd. be told tht. L.P. if member of H/C. shd. have done this.

	

A.B.	There shd. be no delay.  Shd. be announced to H/C. tomorrow.



W.W.	Cd. be included in L.P.’s statement on Business.



H.M.	Let C.E. make statement at end of Questions.

	We must stand firm v. pressure for general legn.



Att.G.	Need for quick discn with N.I. Govt.  If they accept the Opinion cover N.I. Parlt. in Indemnity Bill.

							[Exit Wheatley. Enter D.J.

	Private Members’ time – will report to Cabinet prs. on Thursday.

	Leasehold.  Is coming up to Cabinet.



P.M.	Ministers shd. hurry up and get legn ready earlier.

	Slipping into habit of supposing everything must be mentioned in K.’s speech.

J.	On c) couldn’t we pass the Bill and defer its operation.



A.B.	Sugar Corpn Bill.  Does this prejudge Cab. decn on policy?  



H.M.  	No.



P.M.	Why not put c) in Speech.  And not bring it on unless Press plays.



H.W.	Prefer H.M.’s line.



Att.G.	This is somewhat controversial.  Many people aren’t anxious to make concessions to Press.



H.McN.	Improper to link this with Press Council.  Tho’ I don’t favour Bill.
