C.M. 60(50).							18th September 1950



	1.	Parliament.			[Enter W.W., G.S., Att.G., K.Y. H.G.



W.W.	Prospects for Labour voting in Divn.

	Driberg mayn’t be back fr. Korea. – on his way.

	Shd. have a majority, for Tuesday.



H.W.	Shd. be able to avoid a division on E/W. trade ques. on Monday.  Can’t be sure.



P.M.	Shd. we table amendmt to Tory Motion for Tuesday?

	I prefer a straight negative.



H.M.	So wd. I.



W.W.	More in accord with vote of censure.



	Iron and Steel Act: H/Lords.



J.	H/L. meet this pm.  I shall repeat M/S. announcemt. of last week, at request of Salisbury.  He wants to say their attitude is known and no need for them to meet on Tuesday i.e. no debate in H/L.



	Iron and Steel Corpn.



G.S.	Lr. this am. fr. a part-time member, resigning because doesn’t want to be involved in controversy.  McLean.  Wants to publish his lr.  Propose to see him.  Can’t stop him publishg. His lr. – shall publish reply makg. it clear tht. he did undertake to carry out Act.



H.McN.	I wd. have said he was trivial creature, if consulted.





		2.	Overseas Operations (Security of Forces) Bill.											   [Exit W.W. G.S.

								               [Enter Wheatley

C.E.	Mtgs. of Ministers.  Tried give effect to Cab.’s views.

	Essential diffy. cover mischief w’out penalising free speech etc.



Att.G.	Doesn’t purport to cover G.A.I.’s statement of last week – internal troubles.



	Cl. 3. controversial.  Prefer 2nd form.  Even tht. I wd. wish to amend.

	For “likely to prejudice” wdn’t get you home with Courts.  Omit this and subst. “with a view to influencg. public opinion in a moment likely to be prejudicial “…  Or another formula not heard.

	But does Cab. want a Cl. 3 at all?

	Cd. amend the Bill to cover any action likely to interfere with essential services.  Wd. cover bus strike etc., as now.

G.A.I.	Electricity and gas strike is spreading.  Appln for exorbitant rate: small award at arbitn: strikers standing out for full claim.

	Extended Bill suggd by Att.G. wd. be v. reliable.



C.E.	Bill wdn’t help, even as amended, w’out a Korea operation.



Att.G.	You wd. then have to use Act of 1920 – emergency.

	Mil. opn wd. justify amendmts I have suggd.



J.	Trouble: cd. you operate such an Act anyway?  Deterrent perhaps.  But if it doesn’t deter, wd. you use criminal law?  And if you refrain you are open to more criticism for inaction.

	That is the broad issue for Cab?



Att.G.	I may be asked if existg. powers are adequate to deal with G.A.I. story. If not what do we propose?



K.Y.	Distn betwn. direct relns with opns (this Bill) and G.A.I. story.

	Dangerous to trick this Bill up into covering G.A.I. story.

	Wd. it be effective.  Or even politically satisfy.?

	Shd. we try to cope with G.A.I. story by legn at all?



H.M.	My Cttee was thinkg. of P’smouth sabotage – or trade disputes holdg. up mil. supplies.

	W’in those limits, worth procdg. with Bill.

	But much larger issue discussed by Cab. on Thursday.

	Att.G. cdn’t say now we were going to legislate.  Wd. anticipate K. Speech.

	Shd. my Cttee look at it again qua wider issue, and report?



C.E.	To cover G.A.I. story, Bill’s scope wd. be so much enlarged tht. it wd. be diff. Bill.

	Prob. shd. need 2 Bill’s.  M/L. wants powers irresp. of mil. opns.



H.McN.	Agree with C.E.  This Bill is ok for its original purpose.

	If other legn for G.A.I. story, let’s consider the 2 together.

	Don’t consult T.U.C. separately on 2 Bills.

	But cd. Cab. at least say wthr. this Bill is ok for original purpose.



H.M.	I wdn’t delay consultn with T.U.C. on this Bill.



P.M.	Genl. approval of Bill.  Don’t commit ourselves to going on with it.



G.W.	Att.G.’s amendmt wd. meet G.A.I. story so long as Korea goes on.  Why not have it?  This is all we are concerned to counter pro tem.



P.M.	Diffy. of linking gas strike in public mind with Korea.



A.B.	G.A.I.’s statement has made it imposs. for us to go on with this limited Bill.  It wd. be measured v. his statement and found inadequate.

	Consider now what legn you wd. wish to have for wider issue.



P.M.	H.M.’s Cttee to review posn again in context of G.A.I.’s statement.



H.McN.	Can’t we go on with this Bill for Korea?  Consultg. T.U.C.



A.B.	No.  There wd. be a leak.

	Wd. prefer to legislate if at all on that when no Korea incident is going on.

	Danger of fallg. betwn. 2 stools.

	Situatn not so serious as to warrant panic action.

	Comm. leadership can be broken if exposed.



C.E.	Sitn in docks and meat trade may be serious by end/week.

	If T. and G. Union apply discipline to men who engineered last dock strike then will prob. be trouble.  Union haven’t yet dealt with Trib.

	Let’s get this Bill appd in principle by Cabinet.

	Then let H.M.’s Cttee consider wider issue.



E.Sh.	Bill is ok – apart from Cl. 3.  What is alternative?  Reforming T.U.’s?

	That wd. take too long.

	Cl. 3 is weak and doubt if it can be improved.  I wd. drop that.

	Apart fr. Korea, we shall prob. have forces operatg. elsewhere.



P.M.	Inadequate and inappropriate if Comm. attack takes form of disruption of internal situation.

	I wd. prefer to approve this in principle for purposes covered, take no decn to introduce, and go on to consider wider issues.



		Agreed – as in P.M.’s view.





		3.	Legal Implications of Korean Conflict.



Att.G.	J. thinks it’s war. But Truman and St. Laurent have said it isn’t.

	I have suggd a half-way house – wh. Beckett and Lauterpacht approve.



	Important because For. Secy. cd. give certificate wthr. we are at war or not – and if he declined to say war, wd. follow we are at peace with K.

	Suggest consultn with U.S. etc. to see wthr. we can agree.

	P.Q. by Beamish – today – re correspondents with N. Korean forces.  If Cab. agree tht. people shd. understand tht. law of treason applies, I cd. say “it must not be assumed that it doesn’t”.

	Opns are “active service” w’in meaning of Army Act.  I have so advised J.A.G.



P.M.	Truman and St. L. were surely wrong.



J.	Repugnant to common sense.

	N. Koreans are clearly at war with S. Koreans.  Action v. organised State = war, not police action.  Those who join in, on either side, must also be at war.

	But it is desirable to keep in step with U.S. and Canada.

	Therefore, let Att.G. consult them.

	

A.B.	If you believe our law of treason applies, say so more clearly.

	“It must be clearly understood tht. the law of treason applies”.

	The law refers to King’s enemies, not a state of war.



K.Y.	Not sure pol. advantages are on side of Att.G.’s formula, re intern. law.

	Some internatl action requd to make it valid in internatl law.

	See p. 6.  Our decln (to respect rules of war etc.,) wdn’t bind the other side.

	Also ambiguities in domestic law eg. Trading with Enemy.



	Agreed statement – J., L.O.s, F.O. and C.R.O. to work it out for submn to U.S. Govt. and Comm. Govts.



Att.G.	Not much confidence in my ½ way house.

	But many experts favour it.

	No precedents: therefore consensus of opinion can make new internatl law.



H.G.	Then hadn’t we better decide what we want the law to be.

	There are policy considns – e.g. financial.



P.M.  	Examine both legal and policy considerations.



							          [Enter M.W., G.S.

		4.	Strategic Exports to E. Europe.



H.W.	[Opening statement not heard.]

	Circulate informn re all manufacturers to N.A.T.O. and Comm. countries.

	Suspend m’while decision.

	But follows tht. if no one wants it, it wd. have to go to E. Europe.



G.S.	Cravens have told me this am. tht. both tools were ordered before Policy Agreemt. was signed.  Our assurance therefore applies to both.



Att.G.	We are then under clear legal oblign to allow export of both.

	On orders placed after Agreemt. posn is obscure.  Read Art. 9 of Agreemt.  Refce to “export policy” means policy at that time.

	If order was consistent with that policy, we are obliged to secure delivery.

	But doubt arises fr. confidential lrs. suggestg. tht. firm assurance re export licence be obtd in each case.  Machine A. is subject of such an assurance.  If we flout tht. oblign we needn’t bother about B.

	Tho’ for B. an export licence was granted.

	Clear oblign to deliver Machine A.  Poles wd. have good cause to complain if Machine B. were stopped if ordered (as prev. said) in Apl. ’49.

	If (as now said) ordered in Nov. ’48, clear oblign to deliver Machine B.



H.G.	Support H.W.’s plan of circular to N.A.T.O. Powers and Comm.

	Words “subject to Treaty obligns”, can stand.  Needn’t say in debate or in advance what decn we shall take in particular cases – wthr. we breach the obligns or no.

	On Craven tools, we shall have to say they are subject to Treaty obligns

	We are now about to talk to U.S. re free machine tools from them.

	Some Americans suspect we are selling ours and getting them to supply us free.  It wd. help in those discussions if B/T. cd, say in debate tht. we cdn’t expect U.S. to supply tools wh. we are sellg. to E. Europe.  But restrict it to Iron Curtain countries.



H.W.	Agree – tho’ I wdn’t speak in terms of U.S.A.

	Can’t announce a decn re Craven’s even on basis of their latest informn.

	For they are so unreliable.



Att.G.	No doubt about Machine A.



H.W.	But it’s B. tht. is important to us.



P.M.	In what circs. wd. we be justified in breachg. oblign re Tool B.



E.Sh.	Present circs – because urgency of acceleratg. tank prodn.   Pinch it and compensate Poles.



H.W.	Do we denounce Polish Agreemt. in order to take this tool?

	A substantial change of circs. warrants diff. view of Agreement.

	Good moral and pol. reason for breachg. our obligations.

	On balance I favour breakg. our oblign because circs. have changed.



P.M.	I endorse that.  Cover both A. and B.



H.W.	I will say specifically we want B.

	No need to say they won’t get A. because we don’t yet know wthr. any N.A.T.O. country will want it.



T.W.	Don’t decide today about A.  Importce of Trade Agreemts.



A.B.	Need we commit ourselves to anything beyond P.M.’s b’cast – before we know what U.S. will do, wthr. other N.A.T.O. Powers will follow our lead etc.

	We have no assurances about timber, coarse grains etc.



K.Y.	Support H.W.’s view.  Want firm statement on B., to placate U.S.

	Breach of agreemt. can be justified by change of circs.  We don’t think this alone wd. cause Poles to cut up rough on trade generally.

	Vagueness  A. wdn’t hurt E.B.’s negotns with U.S.

	This need not be taken as irretrievable step twds. econ. blockade.

	(as indicated in B/T. memo.)



G.W.	If we are going to circularise N.A.T.O. Powers, shd. we not make them do the same?



G.S.	Must do the examn quickly because finish is diff. for diff. countries.



						[Exit G.S., Att.G., Wheatley

		5.	Groundnut Scheme.



M.W.		Average year in Kongwa: But consider results –



		G’nuts    £31.000 value.  £96.000 cost. on farm alone: no overheads

 		Sunflowers   46.000   “     480.000 “     of Corpn etc.

		Maize           22.000   “       29.000

		Sorghum         6.000             9.000

	    	 Total:         105.000	      614.000



	Feel therefore I had no alternative but to cut down opns next year.



J.G.	Support M/F.



M.W.	My view: this scheme must ultimately be Col. Dev. scheme.

	Propose joint adminn from now on with C.O.



E.Sh.	Do that earlier?



M.W.	It will come up in Nov., on future of scheme as a whole.



H.M.	Timing of announcement.  Most awkward to have this out on Wed. next.



M.W.	I cdn’t have foreseen steel debate.



J.	Better to let it out on Wedy – submerge it in other fuss.



P.M.  	Whole ques. (substance) shd. come to Cabinet.





		6.	Emergencies.



C.E.	Statement in Press tht. Police knew what was going on at mtg. of dockers.

	Such disclosures may damage work of Sp. Branch.



H.M.	Let Home Sec. spk to Editor. D/Herald.
