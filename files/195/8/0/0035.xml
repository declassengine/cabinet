C.M. 65(50)							             29th October 1950



		1.	Meeting of Commonwealth P.M.’s



P.M.	Invitns issuing.

	Secrecy – until simultaneous announcement.





		2.	United Nations: Secretary General.



E.B.	R. are now putting fwd. Bajpai vice Lie.

	May be difficult.  Good on merits: but awkward tht. R. propose it.



A.B.	Support Lie because India has taken separatist line over Korea.



E.B.	Will consult P.M. before deciding finally.



H.McN.	S. Genl. shd. be from a small Power.

	

						             [Enter W.W., Att.G., A.

		3.	Parliament.



H.M.	Business for next week.



A.B.	Why shd. H.M. speak both on Mon and Wed?  Why not play down extension of supplies and Services – leave it to Parly Secretaries?  Many Dpt. Ministers are concerned. 



H.M. 	V. many: so many it’s diff. to choose.  And I have done the co-ordinn: thought it natural that I shd. do it.  Will be debate of importce.  M/State (E.A.) cd. wind up.



P.M.	Let H.M. speak on Supplies and Services.





		4.	M. MacManaway.



H.M.	Parly Lab. Party y’day was critical of Govt.’s magnanimity. Appeased by promise tht. Govt. wd. criticise McM in speech and Tory Party too, for voting after ques. referred to Judicial Cttee.  Some wd. have liked to exclude tht. period.



	On Indemnity Bill: suggd there shd. be some criticism – either in Govt. speech or by Labour amendment.  But shd. need assurance tht. amendment wd. be w’drawn.



Att.G.	Tory Amendmt.  They will suggest R. Commn to enquire into anomalies in connn with election of clericals. eg. letter in Times this a.m.  It is true tht. there are anomalies.



P.M.	R. Commn is wrong instrument.  H/C. matter.  Shd. be handled by Select Cttee.  



C.E. 	Endorse that view.

  

H.M.  	Yes.  For Govt. supports wd. dislike any concession to Tory views today.  Also remember on report of any enquiry we shd. have to act: and v. diff. issue eg. R.C. disabilities.



P.M.	Sel. Cttee has recommd legn: Govt. has declined: awkward to do nothing.

	Better offer (another) Sel. Cttee.



J.G.	Wd. arouse controversy in country if suggd we are considerg. admittg. R.C.’s.



Att.G.	Sel. Cttee unlikely to report in favour of removing clerical disabilities – because of v. gt. diffies involved.



H.D.	Better to stall.  



Att.G.   	Yes: if a soft answer is given.



E.Sh.	In long run. R. Commn might be better because appointmts need not reflect state of Parties nor report quickly.



P.M.	Can you get a R. Commn composed wholly of agnostics.

	Also H/C. shd. reserve this right to itself.





		5.	Festival of Britain: Sunday Opening.		            [Enter D.J.



H.M.	Some legn is inevitable because known tht. a common informer would move.

	If Fun Fair not opened, not worth opening Festival Gdns. at all.  And trouble with contractors.  



P.M.  	Why?  



H.M. 	They have assumed a 7 day week: justifiably because practice is common outside London.

	Believe visitors will think it odd if Fun Fair closed on Sundays.

	Not going to be noisy – necessarily – there isn’t in Sweden.

	Views of Churches.  Generally against: tho’ Battersea clergy are in favour.

	Fun fair will be popular: if not opened on Sundays, there will be public demand for it.



G.A.I.	Don’t let’s be so kill joy in London.

	Public opinion will support H.M.’s view.

J.G.	Why do we need legn in London if places in Annex can open w’out it.



C.E.	Because they don’t charge admission.

	I take opposite view.  Non-conf. opinion will be strongly opposed.

	And Provinces (who also vote in H/C.) must be regarded.

	Churches aren’t reliable because they want to get rid of common informer as humiliating to them.

	Recommend we apply ordinary law to Gardens.  Legal for years to open Museums.

	One thing to open Exhibn: another to promote special legn to open Fun Fair.  Bound to arouse controversy – at a time when we don’t want to alienate non-C. votes.



J.G.	Such legn wd. be linked up in Wales with movement to repeal Sunday closing of pubs., promoted by brewers.  Our Party wd. be identified with brewers.  Avoid legn if at all possible.

	Many Welsh members wd. vote v. it.



H.McN.	Agree with C.E.  Wd. arouse gt. opposn in Scotland. Govt. supporters wd. be embarrassed.  For many people this is a ques. of principle. Where wd. we be if Tories chose to oppose it?



W.W.	Tremendous feeling in our Party v. encroachments on Sunday observance.

	You wd. have diffy. in getting it thro’ Party.



A.B.	As an agnostic I am against Sunday opening.  If Christianity had not thought of a day of rest, it wd. have bn. necessary to invent it.



P.M.	Arguments in memo. are pitched too high.



D.J.	i)  Agreed Ty. subsidy £9 m. on basis of Sunday opening.

	ii)  B’sea opposed Fun Fair because denied access to Park.  Worst	still    	if they are excluded.



A.	Fun Fair is only ¼ of Gardens.  The other ¾ could be open?



H.M.	I think so.  Ques. wd. it be worth while?



C.E.	Not opposed to concerts etc. in Festival Gardens.



J.	Travel Assocn attach importce to it.  



C.E.  	That wd. make non-C. opposn worse.



Att.G.	Amendmt will be moved to include Fun Fair.  Ques. really is: shd. we leave that to a free vote.



H.M.	Will consider drafting Bill that way and allowg. a free Vote on Fun Fair item.

A.B.	How will Govt. vote?  We shall be in trouble: eg capital punishment 

	issue.



H.M.	This is a rather diff. issue fr. capital punishment.  



J. 	More like Prayer Book.



A.V.A.	Against this.



J.G.	Settle on basis of para. 4.

	Is Festival really going to break financially on Fun Fair alone.



J.	If any legn necessary, amendmts will be moved: and we have to decide what Govt. attitude shd. be.



P.M.	Leave this particular issue to a free Vote, includg. Ministers.

	Include it in Bill, but say at once this will be left to a free Vote.

							                [Enter Wheatley



		6.	Leasehold Reform.



P.M.	Is temporary legn required?



Att.G.	No simple matter, as we thght.  Shape of it will compromise perm. legn E.g. if we allow rents to rise: perm legn wd. have to be on same basis.

	Tories may argue we cd. deal with it by perm. legn now.  It wdn’t be much more complicated or controversial than this.

	I believe “rent not exceeding rateable value and on a market not affected by scarcity” wd. prob. meet the case.



A.B.	Cd. we have perm legn with present Parly majority?

	Our only hope is to put up tempy umbrella, and give time for thought.



J.	I agree with A.B.  Satisfd we must have tempy legn – for as short a period and with as narrow a scope as possible.



		Agreed: temporary legn is necessary.



	Para. 5(a)



A.B.	All leases.  For landlords are exploiting grander property, esp. in 

	London.

	Said there is no evidence.  Look in Willett’s window: £7/10.000 for 30 year lease of house of rateable value of £120.  We shall be accused of class legn if we limit it to Rent Act field.

	For shops, no limit at all.



J.	If perm. legn I wd. agree.  As only tempy, I want to narrow field as much as possible. …… (part unleased) ……



	Para. 5(b)



A.B.	In favour of all leases wthr. pre-war or post.



J.	Don’t feel strongly about this.



Att.G.	Circs. haven’t changed. There is justifn. for intervention : and it doesn’t apply to post-war leases.





		7.	Socialised Industries.



		C.P. 233  improved.



		

		8.	Economic Planning: Full Employment Bill.



H.M.	If we agree now tht. Planning Bill be mentioned in King’s Speech we can consider later wthr. positive powers be included in it.



		Agreed on that basis.





		6.	(cont’d) Leasehold Reform.



Att.G.	No evce of hardship on post-war leases.  Cttee found more.



A.B.	Unless tenants are protected, we shall be in trouble.



H.M.	All landlords aren’t wicked rich.



A.B.	Labour Party have always favoured those who are using a house more than those who derive income from it.



Att.G.	I wd. compromise on 1945 as starting date.



		Agreed:  accept December 1945 as compromise.

			    Discuss remaing. ques. in memo. on Monday.



							                   [Exit J. and A.



Wh.	Trouble arising fr. applying same formula to long ground leases and other leases.  First class won’t thank you for turning them into protected tenants.



Att.G.	This is why I didn’t favour tempy legn.



H.McN.	We aren’t dealing only with long ground leases.  And anyhow some of those have changed hands in recent years.



A.B.	Also paras. 19-20. make my case against restrictg. this to long ground leases.  And this is why I still want to go even beyond Dec. ’45.



Att.G.	M/H. is trying to amend Rent Acts in fact tho’ not in form.

	Tied Cottages must also be excluded specifically, 	           [Exit W.W.

	and this will raise a storm.



Att.G.	L.P. Cttee did consider tied cottages.
