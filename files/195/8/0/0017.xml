C.M. 43(50)							                      6th July1950



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter W.W.



H.M.	Business for next week.



A.	One or two Bills due for H/Lds. – only 2 wks. left.

	One to come to H/C. – on brkg. up roads and will cause some trouble for many amendmts made in H/L.



J.	Liberties of Subjects Bill.



	Politics – trying to put Labour Party in posn of opposing principle.

	Impossible to seek to amend, clause by clause.  Propose to move none: but oppose each clause, on “stand part”.  May divide on some and not on others.



H.M.	Not unduly worried.  Other people may move amendmts.

	We shall kill it in H/C. – shan’t give facilities.



A.	Torpedo each clause by argument and say if you want to pass this silly clause it’s yr. responsibility.

	And we will keep it in H/L. until last week of Session.



H.M.	We shall adjourn on 28/7 and meet for a week on 17/10.



A.B.	Don’t say so now: for it assumes a King’s speech.



W.W.	Not unless you go further and announce opening date of new Session.



	White Fish.



H.McN.	Fish is to be discussed in Sc. Grand Cttee next week.  I shall be asked for details of subsidy.  Fishery Dpt. Estimates.



H.M.	Cd. slip out on grounds it involves legn - Supply.

	Any full explann must be given to H/C. as a whole.  You cd. say so, as excuse.



H.McN.	Will discuss with T.W. and W.W. and report to H.M.



							[Exit W.W. Enter K.Y.

		2.	Korea.



P.M.	Have discussed in D.O.  Can’t send land troops to Korea.  For we are exposed elsewhere in F/E. and S.E.A.

	Examing ques. of help fr. Austr. and Pakistan.

	Mustn’t neglect West.

	Getting in touch with U.S.  Alerting our Commns.  Overhaulg. our war plans.

	If sitn isn’t cleared up quickly, we shall be in danger all along our exposed front.



H.D.	Y’day’s debate was satisfactory.  Legal quibbles weren’t stressed.



A.B.	Govt. supporters behaved well.



H.M.	Party mtg. was useful prepn.



A.B.	R. re-action was curious.  R. wd. not now wish U.S. defeat in Korea.

	R. will want to save U.S. face.



P.M.	They wd. prob. prefer longer drawn out Malayan affair to keep U.S. bogged down there to neglect of other theatres.



K.Y.	S. Council seekg. to give MacA. free mil. hand and at same time gain appearance of adequate U.N. control.  No trouble over first. Second: suggn. of Cttee.  Awkward because of composn.  Many of Comm. contributors aren’t on S. Council.  We don’t favour Cttee at all.



						[Exit K.Y.

		3.	Meat Strike.			[Enter B., Att.G., M.W., R.R.S.



C.E.	Full ⅛ ration (includg. bully) this week.  But for next week, we shall have to go into docks and unload ships.  Risks complete dock strike.

	Must face that risk.

	Suppl. Ques. by Mellish y’day (or Tues).  He has since told me that, however good a case we have, Ldn. docker is bound to strike as soon as troops appear.  Tho’ they don’t want another stoppage.

	Can’t contemplate workg. whole of docks with Service labour.

	Wd. throw mil. training (includg. T.A. camps) into chaos.

	Recommend alternative A in para. 6.

	Mtg. of strikes last night – 70 men only.  Another this a.m.



G.A.I.	Another P.N.Q. today.

	At mtg. this am. don’t know what may happen.  H’to promised to return to work on unacceptable condns. 

	Last night’s mtg. demanded tht. all out-standg. claims in road haulage industry be settled w’in 21 days. (There aren’t any).

	Also, threat to extend strike into p.u. field if Smithfield workers aren’t taken back.  Depn going to Transport House.

	Tug. boatmen’s strike. Sunday: employers’ proposals were put to men who authd leaders to negotiate.  Unoffl. mtg. then decided to proceed – takg. meals at fixed hours regardless of posn boats were in.  Employers were going to issue notice of dismissal: on repns fr. M/L. will now issue notice of warning.  We must acquiesce in that.



P.M.	Comm. inspiration?



G.A.I.	Yes.  Related to Korea.

B.	Potential trouble in transport world.

	Might be provoked by precipitate use of troops.

	Don’t bring docks out – over this use of troops – at our invitation.

	Men are gettg. bored.  Strike may collapse before w/end.  Esp. if T.G.W. Union wd. do their stuff.  By Govt. action always we are playing into Comm. hands.



	cf. Mellish’s views.

	Must produce collapse of S’field strike by action w’in TGW Union.

	May be call for volunteer labour, via troops or as well; and that wd. inflame feeling throughout transport movement.



C.E.	Increasg. impn tht. T.G.W. Union have no discipl. control over their men.

	M/T. suggn wd. have spread the strike.



G.A.I.	Comms. are out to get Deakin, who is spearhead of T.U. attack on Commn.



H.W.	Anyhow, we are now commd to use of troops: cdn’t make less use of them now.



B.	Agree: but concurrently by policy of getting as much co-opn as poss. fr. loyal elements in T.G.W. Union.



G.A.I.	Deakin’s attitude.  No compromise.  No concession to unoffl. strikers.



A.	Can’t you find out who is behind these strikes?



G.A.I.	H.O. have found nothg. save Post Workers’ Cttee.



C.E..	No evce of  Comm. inspirn.



H.D.	Can’t you identify particular men, wthr. they are Comms. or not.



A.	Who called last night’s mtg?



C.E.	Nothg. illegal in summoning such a mtg.



A.B.	Comms. have all advantages of surprise.

	Suggestn.  Para. 4 gives more infn than we have ever had.

	Shows the sensitive points

	Authorise para. 6(a) if Em. Cttee after examing. para. 4, can offer no alternative action.

	Under 4(b) we might get much meat w’out conflict with dockers.  



C.E. 	Those men are on strike.  We have to put troops into docks to get the 4(b) meat.

  

A.B. 	No: we cd. use Co-op drivers and other loyalists to go into docks and fetch it. 



B.  	And make Executive of Union a party to that opern. 

  

C.E. 	Still a risk tht. individual drivers wdn’t do it.

	Cold store capacity in Ldn. = 100.000 tons.  Cd. not this be used for meat.  Most of them cd. be used w’out access to S’field.  This storage shd. be kept filled to capacity until we are out of Comm. risks.



B.	Dockers don’t want to strike.  Might persuade them to co-operate if elsewhere labour were used.



G.A.I.	Ready to approach Union on this.



J.G.	Support such an approach.



		Agreed : this should be tried.



J.	Wise to distribute all reserve of meat.



P.M.	Exp. if we want to mobilise p. opinion v. strikers.



H.McN.	Plans already announced.



P.M.	Agree: can’t change plans now announced.



	Agreed.



G.T.	Some opportunity will have to be given to the end for strikers to climb down.  Cd. we link that with refraing. fr. use of troops in docks? 



P.M.  	Em. Cttee to consider problem of keeping cold stores 100% full , varying ration as required, in order to make Govt. less vulnerable fr. strikers at S’field.



	Agreed:	Try Barnes’ plan in consultn with Deakin.

			If that fails, adopt para. 4(a).



C.E.	Tug-boatmen.  People seeking to force a show-down.  Hold it over for a week.  Might start trouble all round.



	Agreed: urge employers to hold their hands.



E.Sh.	Views of Services on use of troops.  Read out brief.



Att.G.	Police are lookg. for evce for criminal procdgs.  Have employers considered procdgs. for damage? 



P.M.  	Let M/F. enquire.
