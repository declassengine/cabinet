C.M. 77 (50)				                                                         23rd November, 1950



1.		Coal.

				[Enter W.W., R.R.S.



P.M.	Shortage of coke.  Stop exports (ex-contract):  &amp; industrial consumers back to last winter’s level.  95% of previous.  Avoids rationing.



H.W.	Diffy. with Sweden:  talks starting:  50% of coal &amp; no coke – means corresp. redn in their supplies to us, esp. timber &amp; wood pulp.





2.		Parliament.



H.M.	Business for next week.

	F. Affairs debate.  E.B. to open.  P.M. to reply on 2nd day.



P.M.	Govt. made survey recently:  prs.  Opposn cd. start.



H.M.	Doubt if Govt. supporters wd. like that. 



			Agreed:  E.B. to open.

			               E. Davies to intervene in reply to smaller points,

			               before P.M. replies.





3.		Supply of Arms to Egypt.



H.M.	Trouble in H/C.  Offered debate, in response to pressure from our supporters.

	Opposn have [now] tabled a Motion:  this will now be called, I presume.



W.W.	Opposn claim tht. we have made more concessions to our side than to them.  Suggest statement at end of Ques. to-day to clarify situation.



E.Sh.	Formula put in P.Q.’s. was acceptable to Opposn &amp; to House.

	And, if we are asked about debate, refer to what E.D. said in adjournment debate.

	In M/E. 2 Cent. Mark II.  60 Cent Mark III.  6s Comets and 108 Cromwells.  Yet we are selling Cent. Mark III to Egypt.  It’s awkward debating point.



P.M.	Orders date back to earlier period when a certain amount of export sales was necessary to keep our capacity in being.



A.B.	No one quarrels with that.  But C.O.S. now say we haven’t enough for our own purposes.  And ques. we will be asked is:  why send our most up-to-date arms to unfriendly country?

E.B.	Not unfriendly:  under oblign to train &amp; equip them.

	If Treaty is denounced, that oblign will disappear.  But at present it still applies:  &amp; not clear tht. it’s to our disadvantage to m’tain the Treaty obligns.



A.B.	For 5 yrs.  Eg. has bn. hostile.  Tankers thro’ Canal.  No memo. yet on that.  Shown in Palestine they are unfit to fight:  yet we arm them with modern weapons.



E.B.	Does M/H. wish to denounce the Treaty.  Let him put in a memo. if he does.  And let’s see where we stand.  Does he want us to come out of Canal Zone?



E.Sh.	Equipmt. of our troops in M/E. is up to peace establishmt.

	Jet aircraft wd. have to go into reserve, for lack of crews:  &amp; case for selling them to friendly countries.



A.B.	Why haven’t F.O. put in their memo. on tankers thro’ Canal.



P.M.	That is a secondary issue.  And before Security Council.



P.M.	Shd. have a memo. &amp; full discussion on M/East.



E.Sh.	No need for it.  I’m ready to stand by Def. Cttee decision.  E.B.’s line of yesterday will do.

		Stand up to our own supporters:  &amp; don’t be kicked around by them.  This storm is not of importance.



E.Sh.	A certain quantity of modern equipmt. is insisted upon for training.



E.B.	And we never carried out our oblign to train Eg. Army.

		Nor did we make it efficient country.  Only money - &amp; that all went to Pashas.



			Agreed:  Leave it as it stands.  No memo.





4.		Catering Wages Act.



A.	Expect trouble in H/L.



G.A.I.	We have a good case.  Employers are trying to smash Act wholly, for pol. reasons.



H.McN.	If separate organn can be offered for Scotland, opposn will be smashed.



E.B.	Labour Party machine shd. be turned on to spread publicity in favour of this system – which, adjusted, is v. beneficial.



H.M.	Not only Tories.  T. Johnston also is worried about effect of Act. – others too.

				              [Exit R.R.S.

	Adjustment is going v. slowly.  And Festival approaches.





5.		Government Industrials:  Annual Leave.

				 [Exit W.W.

			                                                          [Enter P.M.G., G.S., H.

H.G.	Arguments in favour are clear.

	Against:  cost, but mainly repercussions on other industries.

	On balance, (tho’ disappointmt. &amp; prob. arbitn) I favour rectn.



P.M.	Output rather than money?



H.G.	Not much – because take 2nd week.

	Repercussions in other indies – more ques. of output than cost.



T.W.	V. diff. moment to do it.  Wd. make it imposs. to w’hold it from miners – at cost of 4M. tons p.a.



G.S.	Wd. have some effect on output.  Steel:  old claim wd. be revived &amp; granted. – etc.  V. unfortunate.



H.	Ditto.  Reaction in ship-repairing &amp; buildg.

	Bring out amount of paid sick-leave which is taken.  Consider that before concedg. more hols.  9 days public hols. in addn to the week.



N.E.	Ditto. 75.000 wd. be immediately covered.  120.000 others wd. claim it.

		We shd. have to recruit another 3.000.  We wd. resist this.



G.A.I.	Ques. of principle.  govt. is followg. industry, not leading it – on condn of emplt.  Don’t use arguments suggd by Ch/Exch.

	Continue to justify Govt. practice on basis tht. we will follow good employers – and they haven’t done this yet.



J.G.	How get round R.S.C.P. promise in para. 3?

	Better prs. to give this in return for revocn of sick pay scheme.



T.W.	Wdn’t save us on repercussions.



E.B.	I’m opposed to principle of denying to one what you can’t yet afford for all.  Esp. as I have always used condns of one section to secure the same for others.  Why give so much more leave to clerical workers etc. than to workmen.

	Workers won’t be content with one week’s holiday.

	Sometime we must change this: tho’ this may not be the moment for it.

	Labour Party used to claim tht. Govt. shd. be best employer.

	Can’t we hold an enquiry?



A.B.	Can’t restrict it to Govt. employees.  Wd. have to direct Boards to do same for socialised industries.

	We must face discrimination betwn. industries.



P.M.	{ Say this can’t be conceded pro-tem.

	{ We must have more informn re repercussions

	{ Also consider swop with sick pay scheme.



			Ty. &amp; Ministers concerned.

				  [Exit N.E. and G.S.

				  [Enter 2 L.O.’s.

6.		Naval Courts Martial.



H.	As in memo.

	Pilcher’s last report is now in &amp; will be considered.



A.	Won’t they ask what our intentions are – on the report.



J.	They may.  But, in principle, report on a non-secret ques. wh. is of interest to public shd. not be with-held.  Publish.

		And answer ques. when it comes to legn.



E.Sh.	Will conform to procedure followed on Lewis Report.



H.M.	Decisions on 3 ques. of principle will have to be taken before the legn comes under discn.



J.	We decided to leave those ques. on one side:  legislating only on the 	appeal court.



E.Sh.	Agreement betwn. Service Ministers on those 3 ques. will be the first step.  We will get on with this.



Att. G.	Had plenty of time to do it.  Shall be under fire when Bill comes on.  Shall be pressed to state our views.  Worse if we hadn’t published reports.



			Memo. approved.

			M/D. to submit to Cab. [interim] report on 3 ques. of principle.

				                    [Exit H.



7.		Leasehold Reform &amp; Rent Restriction.



Att.G.	No time to consider this properly on Monday.

	We can’t laugh this off.  We may have amendments put down.  Must have some reason for resistg. them.  We must at least say we are considering it.

A.B.	I asked Cab. to include reliefs in Leasehold Bill.  My advice was rejected – on L.O. advice tht. this Bill shd. not include rent restn points.  Cab. decided to confine this to simple Bill because if we tried to cover rent restn matters in it we shd. be in diffies.



Att.G.	Because Cab. cdn’t reach a policy of increased rents &amp; tied cottages.



A.B.	I was never warned tht. this simple Bill wd. expose us to r.r. amendments.  Thought we were told the opposite.

	But if these amendmts. can be moved, we are sunk.  Large nos. of our supporters have changes to propose on r.r. which we cdn’t possibly resist.



J.	Speaker will be advised tht. r.r. amendmts. are out of order.  Gates will not, in that event, be opened.



Att.G.	Any amendmt. of R.R. Acts related to 21 yrs. lease will be admissible.



H.M.	This really is fairly simple.  All we want to say is we are lookg. into R.R. Acts.



A.B.	Suggested alteration of formula:  as on my copy of memo.



			Agreed:  subject to A.B.’s formula.

			               L.O.’s to consider what amendmts. wd. be in    	               order: so tht. Dpl. Ministers may be forewarned.





8.		Prevention of Corruption.



Att.G.	Proof is v. diff. because need to prove corrupt motive.  Act of 1916 recognised that &amp; shifted onus of proof w’in a narrow field.

	But find now tht. Act doesn’t apply to B.B.C.  Several cases where known money passed but motive can’t be proved.

	Also doesn’t cover “licences or permits” – wh. may be more advantageous than contracts.

	D. &amp; P.P. agrees tht. Act shd. extend to charter or stat. corpn &amp; licences, permits.



P.M.	Is this really urgent.

	Won’t Bill look v. wide?

	Public Corpn:  “state ownership has increased corruptn”

		How great is the evil?



Att.G.	No doubt tht. corruption is increasing?



H.G.	What evidence?



J.	Black market. 



H.W.	Not Govt. service.



Att.G.	W’spread corruptn in B.B.C.  Practice in theatrical profession has bn applied to dealings with B.B.C. officials.



A.B.	Long discn previously.  With Ministers directly concerned.

	Not true that corruption is increasing.

	In l. govt. circles much more in 30’s and earlier than under full employmt.

		Public opinion may be more hostile to it or sensitive about it.

	Politically v. unwise to introduce such a Bill.



H.M.	Root out corruption and smash it.



J.	Draft a Bill &amp; look at it – narrow.



P.M.	Suggests corruptn is greater in public service than in private sector.



H.W.	18 months ago I was worried because didn’t want to check personal contacts within the industry.  Satisfied by Att. G. assurance tht. he wdn’t prosecute in such cases.

	If legn is introduced, it shd. extend to all public companies.

	Doubt if this is right time to do it.



H.McN.	Support J.

	Cd. say we are anxious to promote in socialised indies the traditions accepted in Civil Service.

	Wdn’t like proposal re permits &amp; licences.

	Viz., a Bill to extend 1916 Act to public corpns.



C.E.	No precise evidence of extent of evil.

	Proposals for legn usually follow glaring case – wh. may be an isolated one.



Att.G.		i) Act of 1916 regarded as Civil Servants as protection. It is those who offer the bribes we want to prosecute.

		ii) local authorities’ officials are exposed to much temptation.

e.g. examiners for driving licences.

		iii) Ld.Ch., H.O., D.P.P. – all think corruption has increased in recent years.



H.G.	Against suggn (2).  C. Service doesn’t need this protectn.

	Suggn (i) needs further thought.



G.T.	Less corruptn in l.a. circles than 40 years ago.

	V. unwise politically to raise this at present time.



G.A.I.	Against transferring the onus of proof.



E.Sh.	No legn w’out evidence tht. corruptn is widespread.

	Let’s make sure that there is a good case.



P.M.	Can’t get evidence of this.



			Discussion adjourned.



					           [Exit L.O.’s

9.		Nepal.



E.B.	India’s action is comparable with Hitler &amp; Russia.

		Claim tht. reforms are needed &amp; on that a/c Rana family must be ousted.  Their support of the old King is diff. to defend.

	If internal civil war resulted, India’s responsibies wd. be heavy.

	India’s tactics have bn lead.

	Saw Keskar (?) returng. from U.N.  P.M. has seen Menon.

	My view:  at some stage recognise new King in order to secure stability w’in Nepal.  Want to press Indian Govt. to take same line.



G.W.	This is v. diff.  India won’t budge, whatever pressure we bring.

		Risk therefore of getting out of step with India, on ques. to wh. they attach gt. importance.

	Our line is right.  India’s behaviour bad – seekg. interfere with internal affairs of a State they have recognised as independent.

	Shd. like U.S. support.  They aren’t interested parties.

	Work for delay.  Try to get India to wait a week.

	There is no discontent in Nepal.  Let that be seen.

	Mobilise U.S. into line.

	Method for delay:  Nepal Amb. in Delhi has suggd tht. he shd. go to Katmandu to explain Govt/India attitude.  Let’s urge Nehru to accept that.



P.M.	Curious posn.  For 60 yrs. King has bn. dummy:  &amp; hereditary P.M. has ruled.  India’s recogn of old King in revolt = in effect recogn of P.M.’s usurpation of power.

	All this is internal affair of Nepal.



A.	I wd. have disliked too quick a recognn of new King.

	Trouble betwn. us and India wd. be much more serious.  Don’t repeat what we did over China.



A.B.	Don’t hasten to identify ourselves with re-actionary regime.

	Nepal will share unrest of East.

	Believe Indians rather than Falconer.  Aren’t they more likely to be right.



E.Sh.	But don’t do anything to imply tht. India can treat Nepal as satellite State.
