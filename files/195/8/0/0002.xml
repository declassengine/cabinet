C.M.28(50)							4th May 1950



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter W.W., N.B.



H.M.	Business for next week.



	9/5. Burma. W.S.C. insists on debate, and may divide.  Awkward because Burman P.M. will be visiting U.K.  Cd. R.S.C. spk to A.E. and R.A.B?  Yes.



	Shdn’t P.M. (or R.S.C.) speak as well as K.Y.  Agreed: P.M. to reply, if W.S.C. speaks, or to follow him immediately.  Debate to finish by 7 p.m. so that P.M. can speak at public dinner.   Or : move Burma motion to Wednesday.



	12/5. Private Members’ Motions.



J.	Coal Industry Regs.  Prayer in H/L.  Compensn for loss of prospects. Alleged tht. Rgs. don’t give effect to pledges given on Bill.



N.B.	Doubt if they will divide v. this: for if they defeat Regs. they will deprive everyone of compensation.



A.B.	Too much compensn is being paid to salaried classes in socd industries.

	Our supporters are enraged.  No compensn under N.H. Service Acts.



E.Sh.	Cabinet approved the Bills.





		2.	Mining Subsidence Bill.



N.B.	Mainwaring spoke v. Bill because did not meet needs of Rhonnda.  No support in debate. But was to gang up with Emlyn Thomas.  Have discussed with them – believe they won’t persevere with opposition.



H.M.	Can’t handle this Bill w’out united Labour support.  Shd. have to remove it (withdraw it).

	Claim is tht. retrospective date shd. go back beyond 1947 to ? 1941.



A.B.	Can’t concede this now, for support of all loyal miners has bn. obtained.





		3.	Churches and Education Act.			  [Exit N.B., W.W.

								                  Enter Att.Gen.

G.T.	Opposn don’t favour legn.  I shall not therefore mention it.  In reply to P.Q. I shall refer only to adminve arrangemts.



Att Gen.	Only consulted last night and have had no chance for more than snap opinion. Staty duty on l.e.a.’s to see tht. schools are in fit condn: have they discretion to p’pone?  On School form 18, Minister has duty to check estimate of expendre requd to conform with standard, and wthr. managers will be able to meet it, as it arises. No sanction for announcg. a 50%-25% requiremt: and unwise to say publicly tht. he works on this basis.  For in law he must satisfy himself that managers will have resources, not that they have any propn of what is required.



C.E.	Was always recognised in framing Bill tht. you can rely on R.C.’s being able to get the money more than C. of E.  The C. of E. accepted compromise : the R.C.’s never did.



G.T.	We have worked on principle suggd in 2nd half of Att.G’s. statement.

	His 1st diffy. won’t arise because progress of l.e.a.’s will be settled by bldg. p’mme.

	Percentages are only indication of what is likely to satisfy Minister.

	I haven’t published them.



J.	Avoid indicatg. precise qualifns in your speech.  Say: the kind of thing you will look to – in exercise of adminve duty.



	Agreed : Proceed administratively as proposed.





		4.	South West Africa : Proceedings before International Court.

								                       

									           [Enter K.Y.



J.G.	Hearing fixed on 16/5.  Must inform by 6/5 wthr. we intend to intervene orally.

	Danger for us is tht. Court may express views applicable to all dependent territories.



	Anti-colonial Powers wd. like to see Art. 11 of Charter so applied as to make it impossible for us to grant self-govt. to a dependent territory w’out prior discn and approved by U.N. who wd. be disposed to argue tht. independence with reservations v. defence and f. policy (as in Malta) isn’t real independence at all.



	Suggd we shd. interview to safeguard that, if it seems likely tht. Court will make general obsns.  Tho’ diffy. to do this w’out seeming to support S. African view on S.W. Africa.  Malan’s policy is disturbing to Africa – when real risk of black/white conflict.

	We therefore considered appearance with watchg. brief – intervening only if wider issues come up.  Not clear tht. we shall be able to do this.



	Must be ready to ask leave to intervene, wthr. or not.

	On balance	i)  favour getting leave to intervene but refrain fr. spkg.

			    unless genl. consns raised.



			ii) We shall have to make it clear we don’t support 			     native policy of S. Africa.



G.W.	We voted for reference to Ct.  They will be annoyed if we don’t support them there.  We can stand that, however, and shd. determine this issue by U.K. interests.

	Unlikely we can work “watchg. brief” basis.  Must be prepd to spk. at outset.

	U.S. have now made submn to Court.  This strengthens case for our intervening.  For they raise genl. issue (para. 3 of memo.) and also prs. 3(ii) point.  We know these issues will be raised by India.

	If we intervene, we might repeat our earlier stand tht. no legal oblign on Union Govt. to turn mandate into trust territory.

	We shd. advise S. Afr. repve on best tactics from their point of view.

	And guide them into covering our points.



K.Y.	Evenly balanced.  Fear tht. in practice our intervention here will be repd as support for S. African native policy.

	Para. 3(i) is also politically unpopular case to argue.  Shall have to face big adverse votes in U.N. on this – on pol. grounds.

	Support memo. on condn our repve spks. with gt. discretion and that we do our best to deny we are supportg. S. African policy.



Att.G.	V. unlikely President will allow watchg. brief basis.  If repd at all, we shall be expected as Gt. Power to assist court by genl. argument. Awkward then to avoid supporting S. Africa.



P.M.	I was inclined to stay away.

	Have we a locus? Advisory opinion, even if given, will only be a weapon in pol. argument – not conclusive.



R.S.C.	If we appear, we are more bound by decision.  If we don’t, we can claim tht. this decn doesn’t bind us.  Ct. unlikely to sympathise with S. Afr. and we shall be supportg. bad and losing case.  S.W. Africa is special case : don’t choose to bat on genl. issue on this bad wicket.



G.W.	Ct. might decide this is non self governing territory and decide it on that basis, not on mandate basis.  And we shd. have lost chance to intervene.



R.S.C.	No need for us to intervene because not a party. Can’t be blamed for not intervening.



Att.G.	We recommended refce to court.  Diff. for us to stay away and then reject court’s decn.



P.M.	Let us give S. Afr. all advice.  But stay away.



J.	What assurance we shall stop them takg. wrong line if we are there.

	Better have our hands free to argue later.

H.McN.	Political odium if we go.  Not much certainty of influencg. decn.

	First, being certain, outweighs second, wh. is problematical.

	Shd. like someone to examine what Br. repves have said in U.N.

	If nothg. said earlier commttg. us, better to stay away.



P.M.	If we intervene, we ask the court to give genl. rulings.  If we don’t we have better chance of arguing later tht. this opinion relates only to particular case and doesn’t extend necessarily to other territories differently circumstanced.



K.Y.	Internatl court does tend to wander at large.  And genl. practice for a no. of interested parties to attend.  And our practice is to respect its advisory opinions.  V. unusual for us to take the line tht. we don’t feel bound because we weren’t there.



Att.G.	Let’s stay away.  But realise the risks.  The rulings are likely to be of general application.



H.McN.	U.N. have already interpreted Art. 74.  And we’ve said we won’t comply.  We shall equally have to refuse to comply with a Court’s ruling.

	Therefore, stay away.



	Agreed : stay away.				[Exit Att.Gen.





		5.	Housing. Private Licences.



A.B.	Rehearsed earlier proposal.  That was ingenious and politically attractive.

	But proved inequitable.  Many l.a.’s wdn’t have given any licences.

	Test of need for Council houses and own houses isn’t the same.

	Local variation in habit of owning and renting.  Discretion therefore to increase proportn above 1 in 5.

	Also power to transfer licence from one l.a. area to another.



H.McN.	Tempted to follow.  But I announced my 1 in 10 only a month ago.

	And I must stand on that for the time.



G.T.	Beware of black market in licences.

							[Enter B., N.B., G.S.

							 &amp; M.W.

		6.	Economical Affairs.



R.S.C.	Warning v. over optimism.  Seasonal reasons for success in summer.

	Our main embarrassmt. at present is large scale of dollar reserves.

	Can’t conceal them.  With E.C.A. recpts. reserves increased by 141 m. in April.  May lose E.C.A. dollars in 1951.



H.W.	Buying goods for stock wd. help.  Wd. also help to stop blackmail by non-dollar suppliers.  Wd. have healthy effect on world prices.



A.B.	In consequence of devaluation we are giving goods away to N. America: we haven’t got back to 1st quarter of ’49.



R.S.C.	Cost £120 m. more to get same quantity of dollar imports.



A.B.	Shan’t we be able soon to revalue? 



R.S.C. 	Not yet. Quite clear Anglo/Am. attack on sterling is developing. Winchell article saying further devaluation this summer unless Tory Govt. returned.  Believe this is concerted betwn. Tories and Republicans.



H.D.	But this time the facts are in our favour.  Publicn of facts will influence Wall St.



G.W.	Canada also concerned.  Won’t like our plans v. wheat.  If stocking is remedy, let’s draw as much supplies as we can fr. Canada.



R.S.C.	Agreed – timber etc.  We wd. have liked to stop drawg. on Can. credit : but E.C.A. wd. in that event stop their dollars for our Canad. purchase.



H.W.	C/Living.  Apart fr. devaluation, we shd. have got non dollar prices down last year.  If we show we can spend some dollars on supplies we can frighten them more easily.



H.M.	Internal. Coal. Absenteeism double pre-war.

	Ship repairing is worrying. And bldg. too, when tankers built.

	Are we ready for slumps – restrictive practices etc. 



H.W. 	Memo. awaitg. Prod. Cttee. Repairs : report awaited from Admy.

	Must shift repairing to developmt. areas.  But that                [Exit M.W.

	needs new dev. area policy.  Can’t solve problem w’in repairing industry. 



R.S.C. 	Must know first size of that problem – for this we want rept. from Admy.



H.McN.	Tanker windfall saved unemplt. up to 15% on Clyde in 6 months’ time.



H.M.	If we don’t get restve practices out of industry you won’t get the fwd. orders.



E.Sh.	Agree : high costs will wreck the industry.  8.000 t. tramp is costg. 3 times pre-war.  Not entirely due to restve practices. Materials?



P.M.             *	Expedite prepn of report and its discn by Prodn Cttee. *



H.M.	Building Industry.  Hope Prodn Cttee. will deal vigorously with this.



R.S.C.	Anglo-Am. report is a good one.



A.B.	My group met Tuesd.  Have instituted action.  Will report to Cab. later.



	Coal mining.	I hope Hyndley won’t make more political speeches.



	No good preachg. sermons to miners.



N.B.	Don’t like short term prospect.  Consumptn increase exceeding prodn increase.

	1.1% increase so far, with 3.3% drop in man power.  O.M.S. is 4% . Absenteeism is .50% better than ’49., in spite of increased illness.

	Long term prospect not alarming.  We are recruitg. enough labour to man industry when mechanised.

	Need for more washeries – means more capital investment.

	Also more houses in right places – to secure transfer of surplus workers to areas where there are shortages.

	Hyndley’s speech – nothing untoward.



H.W.	Absenteeism. Stats. shd. be presented in reln to longer working week.



J.G.	Invol. absenteeism : higher in this quarter in all industries.



P.M.	Perpetual temperate charts for mining industry.  Makes us unduly worried.



N.B.	Open cast.  Cd. do much better if we cd. have dollar tractors. 



P.M. 	Prodn. Cttee.



G.T.	Textiles.  Confce last week, workers asked employers to modernise industry and welcomed re-deployment.  First time in History!



							[Exit K.Y., B., G.S, N.B.



		7.	Nationalisation of Water Supplies.



A.B.	No need to argue merits of natn appd Party policy.

	Only ques, is one of method. …….



P.M.	Need for close examn.  How will organn work?



A.B.	This is technical matter.   



A. 	Not wholly – also satisfy local needs.



A.B.	Act of 1944 gives M/H. respons. wh. he can’t repudiate : but too chummy to secure amalgamns.

	Organn needed for this purpose wd. be small.  Have only to put water fr. reservoirs to mains.  Purely technical service.



A.	No : who says what roads need mains? 



A.B. 	Water engineers.



A.	No: local demand.



T.W.	Urgent demand in rural areas.  But we shd. consider effect of w’drawg.

	water respons. fr. l.a.’s – political and psychological.  A.B.’s plan is v. tidy.  But gt. l.a.’s will resent loss of services.  They already resent loss of gas and electricity.  Not satisfd tht, W’hall control is essential.  This scheme might draw double attack fr. cos. and l.a.’s.

	In my own area rates have gone up 1/= because no surplus revenue fr. gas and electricity.

	If we do this, must expect strong l.a. opposn.  Wd. have liked to know views of largest labour boro’s.



C.E.	Qua techn. efficiency only, natd scheme represents maximum advantage.

	But no argument used by A.B. wh. wdn’t apply to natn of highways services.

	To take this away fr. l.a.’s wd. provoke v. gt. opposn.

	Prefer to seek means of giving extended jurisdn to municipal undertakgs.

	Even smaller authies will put up big fight.  And public opinion is not moving in favour of such transfer.

	Haven’t yet settled extent to wh. control over natd services shd. be exercised by Parlt.



H.McN.	Scottish circs. different.  i) smaller   ii) biggest areas draw water fr. near at hand.

	iii) l.a.’s have co-operated well in joint schemes.  There are some areas where improvemt. cd. be secured if I had stronger powers to force combinns.

	No technical case for going further in Scotland.

	V. strong political objns to going further.

	With use the technical and political factors co-incide.



A.B.	Eg. Norwich.  A joint board in Norfolk wd. increase Norwich rates.

	But a national organn cd. spread cost of equalisation of rates.

	Cab. shdn’t think a Joint Bd. solution wd. be universally popular with l.a.’s.

	And under Natl scheme you can make water available in transit.



G.A.I.	Must be public control on national basis. Must bring big l.a.’s into this.

	Pride of l.a.’s in their water projects : plan tours to it

	Not impossible to work l.a.’s into national scheme, as servants of Minister.

J.G.	Discn overlooks case for natn scheme in failure to supply rural areas.

	Party thght tht. on this a/c some form of national ownership and control is inevitable.  It was part of our rural policy.

	The l.a. organn will never get water into rural areas.

	Believe l.a.’s will object to this loss less than that of transport, gas and electricity.



P.M.	This pattern is too uniform.



A.B.	May I submit 2 maps	a) national system.

				b) Joint Boards.



	Also financial incidence of b).



H.M.	Divided views. Other possibilities – eg. leavg. big authies  alone.

	Equalisation of rates wd. have to wait for some time.

	Our hands aren’t tied, on method, by our P’mme. Nor by King’s Speech.  Quoted from each.



	A.B. believed he might get legn this session.  Scotland doesn’t want natd system.



A.	Vast topic.  Objective: supply in rural areas.  V. perplexing.

	Can’t grasp A.B.’s plan w’out more informn.

	Some natl authy shd. be responsible for collection and responsive to public needs, accountable for carrying water to rural areas.



	But, per contra, authies like Sheffield won’t surrender their gt. achievemts. w’out a fight.  Cd. we not rope them in?



	Agreed		{Discussion to be resumed.

			{ A.B. will submit maps.
