C.M. 38(50)							22nd June 1950



		1.	Parliament.				[Enter W.W., Att. Genl.



H.M.	Schuman Debate : another ½ day in response to repns

	Govt. spkers : R.S.C. and P.M. – in that order.





		2.	Mr. MacManaway’s Position.



H.M.	Was ready on Thurs. to take Cab. line.  But no-one raised it.  Inclined to let things drift.  MacM. is away for 2 mos.



J.	Must get on with Court if it is to be tried.



R.S.C.	We did decide tht. this course shd. be taken.



P.M.	Constituency is unrepresented m’while.



A.	You are the Govt.  Can’t shelve it indefinitely.



H.M.	V. well: let Ch.Whip see if Opposn will raise it on Business today.

	And we shd. have to find ½ day for debate next week.



C.E.	Can’t we wait until it’s raised?  MacM. has challenged c. informer to go for him, by takg. oath and constituency is not disfranchised.



A.	Disagree: Govt. has duty to get issue decided.



P.M.	Undignified for H/C. to leave it to c. informer.



A.B.	And you have Sel. Cttee rept. recommendg. legn – because they admit the doubt.



P.M.	We as a Govt. remitted it to Sel. Cttee.  If we don’t accept their recommn we must put fwd. one of our own.



A.B.	Awkward for Opposn to reject suggn of Jud. Cttee solemn body.



Att.G.	Need Whips be off on a motion tht. Govt. shd. introduce legn?



H.M.	Traditional in matters affectg. composn and procedure of House.



	Agreed : Govt. to take on initiative.

	Att.G. and J.  Then we wd. like a decn next week so tht. prepns can proceed.



H.M.  	Half day on Tuesday next.





		1.	Parliament (resumed).



		Memorial to Keir Hardie.



H.M.	3rd Priv. Mem. Motion on Friday advocates monument in Parlt. Square to Hardie (Keir).



	Rejected by earlier Labour Govt. – Lansbury.

	Not suff. Parliamentarian?

	Propose to say can’t decide today, tho’ sympathetic.



A.B.	Titular founder of Labour Party.  Marked its emergence.  Shd. be some commemoration.  V. diff. to reject.



R.S.C.	Snowden.  Bust in my room awaitg. sufft. lapse of time to be put in H/C.  What has happened to that?



P.M.	Memorial via statue.



H.M.	By Address if done at all.



	Kitchen Committee.



R.S.C.	Rpt. due next week.  Shd. be discn of principle.  More grants requested. Will be comment in country on public money for M.P.’s eating



P.M.	Put in memo. to Cttee.   R.S.C.  H.M. and W.W. and R.P.S.





		3.	Pensions for Judges’ Widows.     [Exit W.W.

							     [Enter E.Summ. and Wheatley

J.	Worried most by Co. Courts.

	Jurisdn has bn. extended v. much faster than salaries.

	V. diff. for me to get right men at present rates.

	Can’t propose salary increases at this stage.  Ask therefore tht. widows’ pensions be provided on same basis as for Civil Service in 1949 and for doctors.

	Ask only for leave to approach Judges to seek their agreement and, if I get it, to go fwd. with scheme.

	Details of scheme: on basis of Co. County Judge.

	Main worry of Judges is to make provision for widows out of taxed income.

	Recognise we couldn’t legislate this Session.



E.S.	Thought this shd. be deferred because askg. T.U.C. to p’pone claims for suppl. pensions schemes in socd indies.



	On reflectn see cases aren’t dissimilar.  We are askg. men to refrain fr. askg. for new schemes.  This is only modificn of existg. scheme.



R.S.C.	Moreover, fully contributory.



G.A.I.	I also was doubtful because of repercussions.	

	Diff. to go on restraing. T.U.’s if Judges, much better off, get this.

	Realise it may not be public for some time.



A.B.	No analogy betwn. this and doctors.  New service: and sale of practices prohibited.

	But impressed by diffy. of getting new Judges.  That is overriding considn.  We have applied it before eg. to miners!

	W’draw my objn.



P.M.	I was apprehensive and still am.  Will it be a material contn to getting good Judges?  



R.S.C. 	On C. Service analogy, it will.



H.M.	Will be incentive to press for higher salaries.

	T.U.’s argument not met by argument tht. this is existg. scheme.  For rlways etc. have pension schemes and we are saying new entrants can’t join them.



R.S.C.	Basis = reducg. existg. pension in return for provn for widows.



E.Sh.	Is there new State money in this?



J.	See para. 3.



H.G.	Govt. will be in awkward posn if legn goes thro’ with controversy.



R.S.C.	But no T.U. feeling over C.S. pension scheme.  And not a single protest on the legn – tho’ that covered thousands and this will apply only to a handful.



	Further discn: stress on diffy. of finding right calibre of men for 			Co. County Judges and Met. Mags.



G.T.	Only real repercussion is to teachers.  They have taken the point on C.S. Superann Act.  Bound to continue to press for this.  This Act won’t increase the pressure.



E.Sh.	Why is there no estimate of cost.  Ty. usually insist on this.



R.S.C.	V. small: not worth bothering to work it out.  A few thousands only.



	Memo. approved.

						         [Exit Att.G.  E.S.  Wheatley  

                                                                [Enter M., K.Y., G.S. and H.G.

	4.	Economic Development in S.E.A. 



R.S.C.	As in para. 5.



P.M.	Congratns to Paymaster.



	Memo. approved.



R.S.C.	Hope C.R.O. will allow Thompson or some good man to go to Colombo.



H.W.	Will do my best – wanted him for Canada.



P.M.	Support plea for Thompson.			



J. 	Publish conclns as soon as poss.

	This Govt. must treat this with gt. urgency.



A. 	Before others do.





		5.	Integration of Coal &amp; Steel Industries of Western Europe.



								                       [Enter N.B.

R.S.C.	Don’t agree with all recommns.  V. valuable	                          [Exit M.

	report.  Cd. a few Ministers go into it in gter. detail.



E.Sh.	Internatl political aspects, incldg. strategic?  When is that going to be considered.



P.M.	First, economic side:  R.S.C., K.Y., G.S. and N.B.

	Then, political and strategic: E.P.C. might consider that and report to Cabinet.



R.S.C.	i)  small group on economic   ii) then E.P.C. to bring in political etc.,  iii)  P.M. to put main issues to Cabinet.



P.M.	M/Def. can put in memo.



H.W.	I shd. be in.  



G.W. 	Comm. angle: will put in memo.



A.V.A.	Consultn with experts?  



K.Y. 	Steel Fedn individual T.U. repves: but no formal consultn with Unions or T.U.C.



A.V.A.	Concerned at para. 60 – repercussions on workers.

N.B.	We have consulted members of N.C.B. in confidence.

	Have had genl. talks with N.U.M. and N.C.B. on international control: but can’t talk to them on a document of this kind.



R.S.C.	If Cab. decides wthr. we go on with this or not, we can then have consultns. 

	We mustn’t consult in advance of that.

	Not limited to coal and steel – affects all industry in consequence.



A.B.	Workers won’t accept this unless accompanied by detailed plans (financial) for expansion.



H.W.	“They” assume planning v. an impending surplus.  “We” don’t accept that: we mean to have expansion.



N.B.	Paris talks won’t lead to early solution.



P.M.	But may be early break-down and then we may be called in.



A.B.	Examine	i)  organn for control and management.

			ii) political mechanism for supervising it.

			ii) financial plans for expansion.



	Otherwise this is no more than a restrictionist cartel.



 R.S.C.	Ques.  	 i) Is economic co-ordinn desired?

		ii) No extra – national body to run our industies outside Govt. 		control.



A.	Don’t let us be hurried.



K.Y.	Fr. havg. promised to keep us informed will expect us to comment.

	May be awkward to refrain.  That will be 1st moment – on time factor.



N.B.	Important tht. we shd. thrust fwd. development issue, early.



A.B.	Yes: for Schuman was considerg. only prodn against assumptn of impendg. shortage.

	We shd. ask for p’mme of progressive expansion eg. steel consumption.

	Otherwise all T.U.’s will resist – won’t have stabilisn or reduction.

	Plug investment ques.



	Debate on 26th June.



P.M.	Opposn motion: answer is in Times leader.

	Able article by Lionel Robbins in Lloyds Bank Review.



R.S.C.	Broad line:  a) supra-national authy or cartel are out.  But between the two broad area for investign.

E.Sh.	Is any internatl authy compatible with sovereignty?



R.S.C.	Yes: U.N. or O.E.E.C., which latter has done v. much.  All liberalisn of trade in Europe has bn. done by O.E.E.C.



H.G.	Internatl  action followg. discn and agreemt. betwn. Govts.

	Draft amendment to Motion – approved.



P.M.	Assumed W.S.C. will open.

	There might be a “practicable” scheme wh. wd. not be “desirable”.



R.S.C.	Take opportunity of saying what we have done in Europn co-opn.



G.S.	Stress initiative we have already taken.



A.B.	International value of allowg. sterling balances to be drawn down.



N.B.	Tories are not champions of internationalism.



G.T.	How wd. this relate to W.S.C.’s proposal of Anglo-Fr. Union in 1940.



P.M.	Only common citizenship.  Nothg. much in that.

	Comm. posn.  W.S.C. V. vulnerable on that aspect.



A.B.	We favour functional approach.  Fedl approach has precluded internatl action.  And it is action which we want.  Hope R.S.C. will use the Party clichés.



E.Sh.	Don’t forget average man in street, who is anxious to retain his advantages of full emplt. and the Welfare State.  Don’t prejudice those gains.



N.B.	Want rising standard of living throughout world – to assure full emplt.

	That has bn. our constant aim.



K.Y.	W.S.C.’s speech in F.A. debate of March is worth looking at – fr. Franco-G. angle.



P.M.  	Perhaps a mtg. on Tuesday am. to take stock.

	Cab – Tues. via Monday.
