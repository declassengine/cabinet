	1.	Parliament.                                   [Enter  E.S., W.W., G.A.I., K.Y.



H.M.	Tory vote of Censure on Defence Debate.

	We shd. be able to get a majority.



P.M.	Will affect course of debate.  But H.G. shd. reply v. shortly to 

		W.S.C. &amp; then get on with the speech he had planned.



H.M.	Agreed.





	2.	War Pensions.



H.M.	Head’s Motion on 16/2.  Legn Cttee thght we shd. be non-committal,

		tho’ not too cold.  They invited discn with Ty.



G.A.I.	Ex-service Assocns divided on what shd. be done.  Br. Legion want 

		increase in basic rate.  Sc. Legion &amp; Limbless Assocn 

		want more on supplements.

		Better case for the latter.

	Parly Secy. to start, non-committal.  Then let debate run.  For Fraser

		&amp; some others are discussg. with M/P. and won’t like Head’s 

		interventn.  I won’t speak until nearly 4 p.m.

	Read terms of his proposed peroration.  Discussg. that with Ty.



H.G.	Agree we must accept the Motion.  But M/P. must be careful what he

		says because of repercussions.  Avoid also raising false hopes.

		But I will be reasonable in checkg. language wh. M/P. wishes 

		to use.



E.S.	Keep constantly in mind tht. any increase will have repercussions on

		ind. injuries rates.

				[Exit  E.S., G.A.I.



	1.	Parliament (resumed).



H.M.	Business for next week.



H.D.	Thursday 22/2.  Prayer on M/H. M/L.G. split.  Tory line will be tht.

		I shall put homes on good agric. land.  They will argue tht. I shd.

		not responsibility for Housing:  probably tht. it shd. go

		to M/W.  An independent Minister shd. reply – e.g. L.P.  Agreed.



	H/Lords.

A.	On 14/2.  Salaries of Co. Court Judges.  V. strong case developed.

		Chorley was prayed in aid.  Persuaded Simon tht. it was improper

		as involvg. charge on Consol. Fund.  But was bound to accept a 

		Motion askg. for earnest considn.  If I hadn’t, they wd. have 

		carried the other.

	Transport Bill (private member) carried in H/L. against the Govt.



H.M.	This must now be blocked in H/C.

				[Enter  G.S.  Exit  W.W.



	3.	Sulphur.



H.W.	Nothing new from W’ton.  Nothing to raise.

	U.S. seem however to be workg. on it. – inter-agency.



H.G.	Tel. on Balt’s points.  We shd. deal with these.

	We mustn’t over-play our hand.  I think we did on cotton – and were 

		found out.



H.W.	Don’t agree on that.  But agree we must square Balt.





	4.	Germany:  Proposed Meeting of C.F.M.



K.Y.	U.S. draft reply received.  First blush:  seems as good as we’ll get.

	Shall have to settle before Monday.

	Copies of W’ton tels. 473 &amp; 474 handed round.



P.M.	Separate but identical replies fr. the 3 Powers?



K.Y.	Yes.

	First 4 paras. are harmless, subject prs. to some drafting points.

	Paras. 5 and 6 are more worrying.  Suggn of W’ton venue:  and

		Acheson’s reasons for suggesting it.  Pressure of U.S. opinion

		is not all encouraging.



J.	Why mention venue at this stage.



E.Sh.	Discuss in Paris talks.



A.B.	Para. 3 of 474.  x/. Unnecessary to say that.  Omit whole sentence.



P.M.	It is necessary:  for we are refuting Soviet claim.

	Better to insert “main” before “cause” – or “sole cause”.



K.Y.	We will suggest either omission or insertion of “only”

		before “cause”.



E.Sh.	Necessary to mention Austria?



P.M.	We want it on agenda.



K.Y.	Try to get venue discussed in Paris talks.

 

E.Sh.	W’ton is not good climate for this mtg.		[Exit  C.E.



H.D.	At end para. 2., is it necessary so to whitewash Germ. leaders.



K.Y.	Might water it down:  but must answer allegns in Soviet note.



P.M.           y/	Stop at “Republic” if any change is to be made.



H.D.	Para. 4 “for own survival”.  Too hysterical.  Omit:  or suggest

		“safety”, or “security”.



K.Y.	In general, it strikes me as a bit too stiff.



H.G.	It gives us most of what we want.



K.Y.	On y/ we shan’t be popular if we press it too far.



H.D.	Ques. of fact.



P.M.	Put the point, but don’t die in last ditch over it.





	5.	Yugoslavia.



A.B.	Head &amp; others raised ques. of assurances to Yugoslavia, on Monday.

	I may be pressed.

	Can I say:  “Yugosl. has same protn as any other nation v. aggressn

		under U.N. Charter:  and  if any further assurances are 

		required it is for considn [by C.F.M.] not for unilateral action.



P.M.	By or in consultn with other Govts. vice [  ].

	“matter for discn with our friends.

	Not for N.A.T.O. or for C.F.M.

	Ques. of acceptg. any more specific obligns is clearly one for 

		discussion with our friends &amp; not to be undertaken unilaterally.



			Agreed:  F.O. to provide formula to A.B. on the lines

			               indicated above.





	6.	Korea.



P.M.	P.N. Ques. re landing of S. Korean troops nr. Wansan (?).  

		Fenner Brockway.



E.Sh.	No offl. informn available.



P.M.	Then I can say so.



H.M.	Anyway, limited raids to north of 38th is consistent with P.M.’s

		general statement.



K.Y.	A mere raid is no more than strategic bombing.



			                                             [Exit  K.Y.

			                                             [Enter  W.M., H.H.M., Att.G.

	7.	Re-sale Price Maintenance.            Wheatley.

	

	……….. not heard ………..



A.	Danger that prices might rise.



H.W.	Manufacturers wd. stop that.  And in last resort we cd. impose price

		control.



			Agreed:  B/T. to prepare White Paper for Cabinet’s consn.

			               Adopt para. 18(a), if Att.G. can find means.



H.H.M.	Para 21.  Order under Monopolies Act is in train.	[Re-enter  C.E.

		Presume no objn to that.



H.D.	Certainly not.  Welcome it.

			                                                 [Exit:  M.W., H.H.M., Att.G.

	

	8.	Nationalisation of Water Supplies.



H.D.	As in memo.  Action as proposed in para. 3.

	Draw attn to Annex of earlier pp. on effects on rural prices.  V. striking.

		In Norfolk:  only authority to pay more wd. be Norwich.

		Re-distributive justice to rural popn benefit.



H.G.	i)	Compensation – as for gas &amp; electricity?       Yes.

	ii)	Management – area boards, l.a. composed, who will find deficits 

		on their working.



H.D.	Expect no burden on Exchequer.  See para. 3(3).

	The charges shd. ensure there is no deficit.



A.B.	Addl charges in any area wd. reflect inefficiency of local board;  and

		this wd. be incentive.



P.M.	This will increase burden on our urban supporters for benefit of Tory

		supporters in rural areas.  Tho’ I support it on merits.



A.B.	Ty. shd. consider makg. grants to ease posn over first few years.

		They now make grants for capital costs.

		Especially in Scotland, to wh. Ty. has bn. over-generous.



J.G.	This scheme helps rural areas w’out undue centralisation.



H.D.	Equalisation w’in areas.  But corrected by national adjustment.



H.G.	iii)	No addl burden on Exchequer.

	iv)	Financial responsibility shd. rest with the boards – essential to

			efficiency.



A.	Is iii) right?  New works – cost shd. be distributed over whole country.

	Can’t be committed to iii).



A.B.	Diff. to defend equalisn in E. &amp; W. and none in Scotland.

	to ease this, Ty. will have to continue grants.



H.G.	Not seeking to w’draw those.



Wh.	Reserve posn of Scotland.  No suggn of incorporatg. Scotland in this.



C.E.	Grave misgiving.

	What is meant by “water-works”.  Appln includes all capital assets,

		incldg. Mains.  All future extensions will be respons. of 

		M/L.G.

	What is left for l.a.’s to do – beyond collectg. rates?



A.B.	They wd. carry out (?) works as agents of Minister:  manage the 

		service as his agents.



C.E.	Not much in that.  I wd. have preferred “municipilisation” of water

		services.  This is another case of depriving l.a.’s of trading 

		services.  Experience in gas &amp; electricity doesn’t encourage me 

		to believe area boards will be better than l.a.’s.

	Hope M/L.G. will listen to l.a. representns for a greater share of

		responsiby.  cf. County Fire Brigade Cttee organn – bringing 

		smaller authies into work by larger authies.

	80% of water is supplied already under public control.

	Act of 1846 was for water &amp; sewerage.



G.T.	But that Act has never met the interests of rural popn.

	Approach to l.a.’s is v. important.

	They ought to have more share than in gas &amp; electricity.



H.M.	Support C.E.

	Can’t be sure we shall get results fr. this.  Figures only for E. Anglia.

		What of W. Riding or Lancs. – how wd. they be affected.

	Fear that this undermines l.a. govt.  Lost gas, electricity, transport,

		hospitals, rating &amp; evaluation.  The big cities won’t lightly give

		up water:  &amp; are getting desperate about this encroachment.

	Little for l.a.’s to do under this scheme but collect the rates.

	Must avoid situation where others spend Ty. money.

	Wd prefer M/L.G. to get the l.a.’s together &amp; put it to them tht.

		there’s a problem:  must have 100% public control:  anxious to

		preserve as much l. govt. as poss:  have they any ideas.

P.M.	M/L.G. has the middle way in his memo.

		But he shd. find some means of retaing. their interest in the

		capital works.

E.Sh.	Can’t ignore results of other natn schemes.  Haven’t turned out so

		well yet.  Need for great care.

	Favour M/L.G. ascertaing. views of l.a.’s.  Don’t face them with

		fait accompli.



			Agreed:  M/L.G. to talk to l.a.’s on these general lines.



H.M.	I dissent from x/ in C.P. 50.



J.	Talks shd. be exploratory.



P.M.	Shd. not be commd to this scheme.



H.D.	I want to say these are my ideas:  what are theirs:

		and I will inform the Cab. of their views.





	9.	Full Employment Bill.



P.M.	Time is not propitious.



			Agreed.
