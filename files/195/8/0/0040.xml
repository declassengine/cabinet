		3.	Economic Report.		[Enter G.S., N.B., Strang, B.



H.G.	Coal: will come to Cab. separately, from Prodn Cttee.

	Cars: 80% going to export.

	Building: big increase over last year – volume because no increase in costs.

	Exports: We are virtually in balance on visible a/c.  But due to low B/P. volume of imports and dropping stocks.  Can’t continue that. Must export b/payments to grow less good.

	Exports: the target may be reached.

	Pull to exports will be v. powerful.  Our problem now will be to cope with pol. conseqn. at home, shortages etc.

	Dollars: substantial inflow: much of it capital movements.  Not speculative, but advance payments etc. on rumour of revaluation.

	Our reserves will be v. high at end/year.  We shall have to explain by ref. to level of potential liabilities, not absolute figure.

	In 2nd half year surplus will be larger than in 1st – over 100 m. and prs. 200 m. (on foreign balance).  Overall not dollar.

	Improvemt. mainly with dollar area because higher material prices.

	Prices: Terms of trade continue unsatisf.  We ought to be getting higher prices for our exports: diff. to say so publicly.  Import prices rise disturbingly.  Talks in W’ton: O.E.E.C. survey will be followed by pressure fr. there for some action at least by U.S.A.

	Cotton: U.S. have banned exports above prescribed level.  V. awkward for others.

	Seekg. means of bringing pressure on them.

	Wholesale prices are up in consequence.  Retail will rise to 116 in December.



	No fear of wild inflationary movement.  But must expect 3 or 4 point rise prs. by mid/1950.

	Wages: I expect a round of increases comparable to 1946 around 10/= a week.  Wd. fool people they had an increase in real income – for 6 months or so until prices catch up.

	

	E.R.P.  Out-turn of E.P.U.  We have bn. running a surplus: part of it conceded in drawing rights in return for dollars.  Germany: large deficit, prob. due (50%) to excessive stocking of materials, the rest by purchase of consumer goods.  They will prob. introduce import resolns wh. will produce chain consequences.  Must make G. realise they will get no more credits.

	E.R.P.  When I was in W’ton they went no further than vague warnings.

	On my return found Bissell had told people in Ldn. tht. they must end it, because of our reserves.  I talked to him.  And was agreed we wd. talk it over.



H.W.	Exports v. satisfy. and likely to improve.  No evce tht. re-equipmt. will interfere for 12 mos. anyway.  But balance due largely to small imports.



	Not so optimistic re productivity.  In past due mainly to motor cars.  If it is going over to re-equipmt. we shall suffer.

	Also growing shortage of materials may cause cut back in prodn.

	Wood-pulp already short.  Sulphur will be diff. starting to talk to U.S. but private enterprise there.  We face 20% cut.

	Wd. hold back our rayon prodn.  Jute will be short. Cotton is monstrous: U.S. have given all domestic needs and then cut everyone else w’out consultn.



	Wool prices likely to rise even further when impact falls of U.S. demand for uniforms.  Inevitable increases in home prices – eg. 20% on a man’s suit in 12 months’ time.  Am circulatg. memo. on clothing prices.



H.M.	Prices/Wages. Either act or explain or both.

	If we cd. put it over tht. things aren’t so bad as they think, might be right to do so.  But a lot of Press propaganda.

	Table 16 suggests people are buying more things.

	Also on international prices. Australian attitude re. wool: U.S. attitude re cotton.  Shdn’t we let people know – and what we are trying to do about it.

	Wages in full emplt.  If they rise, they stay high.  And export trade will suffer because prices get too high.  Worrying.

	Cd. Ministers concerned get together and see what we cd. all say?



H.W.	My speech on Monday gives all facts.  Is going to all Labour members.



H.G.	H.G.’s speech today will cover international aspects, and something re action we are taking.



A.B.	If reserves continue to mount, it means sterling is under-valued.  Action mght. have to be taken.

	Our dilemma due to havg. controlled one part of economy while allowg. rest to run free.  E.g. if engineering workers on high wages cd. buy a car vice clothes you wdn’t get inflation.



	Unbalance in economy arises fr. our own action.

	Diffies are due to our v. success.  People can go outside utility ranges and buy un-controlled articles – and those prices go higher.  Not enough therefore to base our action on c/living index.



H.G.	I agree tht. this is the psychol. problem.  But I shall defend the index.



G.S.	Productivity in engineering will suffer fr. shortage of metals.  Zinc already 25% down: sheet and strip steel: aluminium next year.  And, if we can’t get German scrap, general steel.



G.A.I.	Wages: Ty. expect 10/= a week.  Don’t think it will be so much.

	Road hauliers’ settlement at 7/6.  Engineers ? below 10/=.

	Lag in prices (B/T.): I doubt it.  I believe prices will catch up quickly.

	Current round of increases won’t however satisfy workers unless c/living rise is prevented.  They feel tht. this is overdue on a/c of past events.



	Movement for wage increases is, however, official T.U. and orderly. T.U.’s now able to take it over fr. unofficial groups.

	Want to steer as much of this into Tribunal as poss.  Workers’ are ready to accept their awards.



N.B.	Miners’ wage award.  Nearly £4 m.  Negotn betw. N.U.M. and N.C.B. was successful.  Bedevilled by Horner’s story tht. miners were owed money under War Addns Agreemt.: that is in men’s minds.

	The award will yield only 3/= or 4/= for some men.  Will be discontent and may be strikes.

	I am holding conference with N.C.B. and N.U.M.



A.B.	Cause = negotn conducted on capitalist basis.  N.C.B. acts just like all old fashioned employer.  They just say “no” – instead of having a plan.

	Can’t expect miners to be content with 3/= a week when teachers are to get 30/=.

	Wages policy of N.C.B. shd. be related to economics of industry.



Att.G.	Bd. were told by Govt. to hold wages freeze.



J.G.	1)	Drop in labour force because school leavg. age.  At 15 boy 	knows better than to go down the pit.

	2)	Mechanisation reduces propn of face workers.  Cdn’t N.C.B. 	link day wage men with increased output productivity – now 	tht. they are larger  propn of whole force.



N.B.	More recruits in ’50 than in ’49.  But we aren’t keeping them in.

	This points to incentive scheme.



H.M.	Wait for the facts.



G.T.	General.  We are constantly being given a target; and when we reach it we are told it’s not enough and we get no credit.

	Cotton, for example.  Prodn increased (at U.S. suggn) and U.S. then cut raw cotton.

	These prodn figures are the best ever: but nothg. but gloom.  Let’s claim the credit for what we have achieved.
