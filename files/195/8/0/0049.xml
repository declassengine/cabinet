C.M. 81(50).				4th December, 1950.



	1.	Interim Index of Retail Prices.



G.A.I.	P. Members’ Motion Friday:  &amp; P.Q. by Ellis Smith Tuesday.

	Time to move twds. a new review.

	Want to say in reply to P.Q. tht. we are askg. advisory cttee to

		consider need of review.

	Want to go higher up income scale.



H.G.	Support this limited move.

	If there is a new review, there will be diff. ques.  E.g. permanent

		food subsidies:  danger of going up income scale.

	Don’t throw doubt of existg. index.

                   x	Text of reply to be settled with me.  x



H.M.	Use social Survey for budget enquiries.



H.D.	A good index:  don’t criticise it.



			Agreed.





	2.	Foreign Affairs.



E.B.	Apprecn by U.S. C.O.S. received &amp; under consn by our C.O.S.

	Later, on report by P.M., Cab. will have to meet &amp; take v. grave

		decisions.  Sitn is serious.

	Must take a/c of French attitude.  And decide wtr. we take risk of

		re-arming Germany – in new situation.

	Some factors may now have to be discussed in W’ton to-day, as

		soon as P.M. arrives.  May get a quick message.



	Messages from Nehru to P.M.  (2 telegrams).

G.W.	Pearson suggd to Nehru (w’out consultg. us) tht. he shd. publicly

		propose a cease-fire.



E.B.	Message suggests India has bn. in touch with Chinese Govt.



G.W.	Message fr. Canada – deprecatg. ‘aggression’ decln etc.  Shows they		are moving away from U.S. policy line.



E.B.	P.Q.’s re directives to MacA.

	E.Sh. y’day in speech implied tht. MacA. went beyond directive.

		I can’t find that he did.



E.Sh.	I was referring to limited objectives.  When U.N. forces went

		beyond 38th Parallel, we knew there were 70.000 Chinese

		massing in N. Korea.  MacA. decided to take offensive &amp; then		found even more Ch. there.  He had gone beyond the original

		limited objectives.



H.M.	P.M. now in W’ton.  We must not break with U.S.

	P.M. has re-affirmed need for consultn with F.O. on speeches.

	Even more important tht. Ministers shd. be reticent while W’ton talks		were going on.



E.B.	I must adhere in P.Q.’s to what I said in debate:  viz., tht. MacA. has

		not gone beyond his directive.



A.B.	If you take a/c of what MacA. has said, as well as what he has done,		it can be alleged that he has gone beyond directive.



E.Sh.	I am not mis-reported.  Accept Times’ report.



	Raw materials.  Will also be discussed in W’ton.  Ministers shd. say

		as little as possible about it m’while.  Tho’ some official

		statement will be made in H/C.



			agreed:  H.M. to circulate advice to all Ministers.



				[Enter B., N.B. &amp; E.S.

	3.	Coal:  (a) Imports &amp; Exports.



N.B.	………. not heard.



H.G.	Shipping difficulties worse than supposed.  No chance of lifting the		800.000 t. of U.S. coal we have bought in U.S.

	That is strongest reason for discussing Polish offer.  We must see

		what quid pro quo they wd. ask.

	Exports.  V. serious.  I regret it.  (Swedes more reasonable on ore than		at first.)  But in all circs. (risks of stoppages here) I think we must		do this.

	It shd. however be discussed in O.E.E.C. or E.C.E. as a raw material		shortage.  Prefer to do it in E.C.E.  If openly discussed there,

		we shall instigate criticisms.



B.	Shipping, tho’ diff., is not quite so bad.

		We shd. be able to build up enough to move it in Jan.

	Cd. Cab. agree tht. 20 tramps chartered for S. Doms &amp; F/East shd. be

		diverted to this coal traffic.



H.G.	How much coal will you lift?



B.	Can’t say.



H.M.	Consider wtr. you have power to divert shipping.



H.W.	Accept the recommns re shipping.



T.W.	Don’t want ships diverted away from grain traffic – coarse grains.



H.M.	Won’t affect you – see Para. 2(a).



G.W.	Moral value of prefabs. to Australia.  N.Z. needs cement.



B.	Only delays it for 3 months.



		(b) Power Stations.



	Memo generally approved.



E.B.	Is thermo-stat being introduced, in new equipmt., to maximum?



N.B.	Promotional sales work is being stopped.



H.G.	Only safe course is to stop all advertising of gas &amp; electricity.



H.W.	Accept memo.  But has M/F &amp; P. as tight a control over consumers 		as we had in war?  Are we m’taing. operational control over

		deliveries?



N.B.	Yes.



E.B.	Re-constitute Coal Allocations Cttee?



N.B.	Will meet Emergency Cttee of N.P.A.C.I.

	Am pressing on with thermo-stat developmt.



H.M.	Consider 100% stop of all advertising for gas &amp; electricity.





		(c) Man Power.



N.B.	As in memo.

	Don’t want such a concession to be dragged out of NCB by

		Communists.



E.Sh.	Ring Fence.  Solely to prevent volunteering for Services – wdn’t

		work.  For they cd. go via other industries.

	Reservists.  A no. were called fr. mining areas – to fill gaps in

		County regiments.  And many of them are now in Korea.



A.B.	Memo. is O.K. – if applied with common-sense……….
