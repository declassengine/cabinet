C.M. 58(50)							         14th September 1950



		1.	Industrial Unrest.		[Enter G.S., and H. and W.W.



G.A.I.	D. Herald this am.  Evce of organised movemt. to disrupt commns – inspd fr. Warsaw.  L’pl. (M.I.5.) will be attempt to stop work in docks, on pretext of delay in concedg. wages charters.

	Ldn. Bus Strike.  Applns for extra £1., based on emplt. of women conductors tho’ they have equal pay.  Also paid sick leave.

	Meat Market, dockers and meat transport – mtg. this Sunday.

	Much of this informn comes from Deakin.

	Polish attempt to get shipping via Gdynia on argument tht. in capitalist ports interruptn thro’ strike will mean constant delay.

	Deakin suggest prescribing Comm. Party – and suggests Govt. shd. consult T.U.C. at once about this.

	Attempt to stop 2 ships loading for Korea.



H.W.	Heard of L’pl. trouble last week.  1945 dockers’ charter.  Don’t think dockers will be taken in this time.  Not wholly Communist – a leading PLC was in it to.

	If we cd. say in advance of strike tht. this was Comm. organised, it wd. help to keep sensible people out of the strike.



H.M.	Must consider this v. carefully – organised pol. warfare.

	Is this Polish M/T. story reliable?  Check up on it.

	Labour Party must get a counter organisation.

	B’cast to workers.  Cards on table.  Get at rank and file and stop them being sheepish.



H.McN.	Who is Free Czecho-slovak Agency?  Be careful about that.

	Cd. a Cab. Cttee go into this v. quickly?



E.Sh.	Comms. will run organised sabotage.  Must go for them.



H.D.	Slack – Dickens – Jones.  Are these men capable of being arrested for conspiracy?  Jail them.

	Plus full publicity.



G.A.I.	H’to no evidence for charge.  Maybe there is now.



J.G.	Struggle for leadership of T.U.’s.  We must find means of winning this fight.  Favour early consultn with T.U.C. and prs. Lab. Party Executive. Reg. Councils might be called and told of situation, mobilise our supporters, with agreemt. of Genl. Council of T.U.C.



J.	Existg. law won’t do.  Agitn to promote strikes isn’t an offence – you will have to prove seditious intent.

	Must either strengthen law on basis of emergency or ….. [sic]



A.B.	Don’t panic.  This is revolving drum tactic, practised in France for some time.



	1) First: tell our people the facts.  Put it over via B.B.C. announcer.

	2) Start active propaganda.  Facts v. Comm. Russia.

	No use prescribing Comm. Party or dealg. with this by strengthening law would draw it underground.  They have gone to ground by decidg. to support Labour Party.



	3) Support J.G. mtg. with T.U.C. Reg. Councils.



P.M.	Can’t get B.B.C. to put this over.  Favour M/L. doing it.



J.G.	Do both.



G.W.	B.B.C. wdn’t mention names because of libel.

	Also must say at once what action will follow - and only Govt. cd. do that.



E.Sh.	Reply to P.N. Ques. today v. strike – saying emergency powers will be used if required.



H.M.	Follow it by Ministerial b’cast tonight.

	Don’t talk of emergency powers yet.  H.O. Bill coming up Mon.

	Cttee wh. handled Bill shd. consider wthr. more can be done.



P.M.	{M/L. to reply to P.N. Ques.  Friday.

	{B’cast by G.A.I. telling men not to be led astray



H.M.	Defer b’cast until we can get a good one.  E.g. Sunday mid-day.



P.M.  	H.M. shd. grip all this – general political action.





		2.	Parliament.



H.M.	No Sat. sitting.

	If Iron and Steel announcemt. made, Opposn will prob. move censure.

	Censure may be taken then on Tuesday.

	Need then for case in timing movemt. of adjournment.

	If Govt. were defeated on censure after adjournmt. moved, diff. sitn wd. arise.  Must therefore take unusual course of takg. adjournmt. motion after censure motion.



P.M.	W.S.C. puttg. P.N. Ques. askg. tht. Steel be p’poned because of emergency and until after fresh mandate.  Spker will allow unless told we shall make a statement anyway.



W.W.	Majority = 1.



P.M.	A bad thing to go to country upon.



G.S.	Removg. uncertainty – good thing for war prepn.



P.M.	Last majority on this was 14.



H.M.	Looks as tho’ Govt. are throwg. in controversy – in defence debate wh. otherwise wd. go w’out a division.



G.S.	Prefer to take initiative and offer statement.  Not in reply to P.N. Ques. 



H.G.	On timing – this announcemt. is unfortunate.  Support H.M.



H.McN.	I support that view.



E.Sh.	This is a crisis. By Oct 17 we shd. be in better posn – know more about defence (U.S. aid etc.).  May have more public support then than now.

	This announcemt. does involve risk of dissoln.

	Wd. prefer to p’pone announcement until Oct. 17.



P.M.	I can’t give the assurance W.S.C. asks for.  Once I say “no” the issue arises.



G.W.	You cd. say – no decn until House resumes.



H.M.	No.  For members of Bd. have accepted appointmt for 2/10.



H.	The H/L. will have a censure debate.



		Agreed:  Announce (no P.N. Ques).

			    Concede a debate in both Houses.

			    (G.S. and H.M.)





		3.	Germany. Police Force.



P.M.	Drew attentn to telegrams fr. W’ton.



	Agreed: leave this open in debate.



H.McN.	Doubtful about merits.



E.Sh.	Def. Cttee gave provisional approval to these ideas.



K.Y.	Ques. of timing.  There will be leaks in U.S. or France.  We wd. have preferred to stand on D.O. line because if we are going to take this controversial step, we shdn’t do it now when no gendarmerie and our occupn forces are weak.  We hope tht. this won’t be endorsed in W’ton as alternative to gendarmerie.

	Doubt if U.S. participn in Europe really depends on our acceptg. this.

A.B.	Why announce before we’re ready to do it.  Credit to W.S.C.  And will unnecessarily provoke R.



E.Sh.	German leaders don’t want an Army.

	This telegram only “envisages the possibility …”  Doesn’t follow tht. this is next step.  Depends on G. attitude.  M’while we shd. stand on D.O. memo. and say no more.



H.McN.	Leakg. already in U.S. Press.

	French attitude as diff. on this as German.

	We don’t yet know what arms we can supply to G.

	Urge E.B. to keep to D.O. memo.



P.M.	Let him continue to explore – w’out committg. himself in principle in advance.
