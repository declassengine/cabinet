C.M. 32(50)							                   18th May 1950



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter W.W.



H.M.	22/5.  Bldg. Industry.  M/H. to assist M/W. in debate.

	24/5.  F/E. and S.E.A. debate.  F.O. Ministers.  C.R.O. watching qua Sidney Confce.



	Whitsun Recess.  26/5 to 13/6.



	On 22/5 debate : agreed – bring in reference to Anglo. U.S. Rpt.

	Ch.Whip to ensure tht. it is available in Vote Office (if not already so).





		2.	Winnipeg.	



P.M.	A.E. wants to put P.N. Ques. askg. us to help.



G.W.	We have made offer to send anything practical – telegram.



H.M.	Choke A.E. off : won’t help.



R.S.C.	Fund (M’head Mayor) – most awkward because sendg. money across exchange.  Better send goods, eg blankets.

	Mention it to Pearson and House tomorrow.  If no answer m’while from St. Laurent.

						                                   [Exit W.W.



		3.	National Insurance: Increase of Contributions.	[Enter E.S.



E.S.	L.P. Cttee majority view in favourg. of going ahead.  Brought it to Cab. because of Genl. Election.  My view : more pol. diffy. if we brought in amendg. legn and gave opportunity for discn of state of Fund.

	My experience suggests tht. people don’t begin to shout until its actual.

	Fund : £347 m. plus £1.000 m. reserve.



R.S.C.	Increased contns are for retirement pensions – cost of wh. will rise v. steeply.  Reserves accruing fr. full emplt. shdn’t be used for mtg. this. For that wd. be unfair to Clauses.  Wd. prejudice Class I chance of getting higher benefits or lower contns.  Interim reviews this March likely to show there is room for concession to Cl. I.  You wd. stop this if you now decided v. overall increase.

	Thus: let law take its course : give special concession later to Cl. I if shown they deserve it.



A.B.	Contributors are largely the same people.  Total fund shd. be available for total liability.  This isn’t insurance : it’s taxation.  The extra 2d. will be used in capital investmt.

	Must we print the cards so early?



J.G.	Increase is in Act : part of actuarial calculns.  Three surprises:-



	i)  Cl. II is less: Cl. I greater than estimated.  That has improved posn of Fund.



	ii)  Benefit claims for sickness have bn. less than assumed.

	12½% was assumed.



	iii)  Unemploymt. much less than the 8½% recommd by Beveridge and accepted by us.  In practice only 1½%.



R.S.C.	£110 m. p.a. in surplus. 



J.G.  	With Reserve, £1.000 m.



J.G.	I believe we shall have to make earlier rpt. on workg. of Act – not yet due (1954).



P.M.	How do you meet J.G. argument tht. assumptions were unduly pessimistic.



R.S.C.	Ques. is wthr. you make concession to all, or to Class I. (who are only people who pay unemplt. insurance).



J.G.	Class II will have to pay whole of 4d. increase.  Imposs. then to decrease Class I contn.



G.A.I.	People generally think of this as single all purpose Fund.

	Mistake to increase contns when T.U.’s know we are makg. profit on the scheme.



H.M.	Little scope for manoeuvre on timing.  Presentn also important.

	If you take Fund as one, burden of o.a.p. on Ty. is enormous.

	I agree it shd. be taken as a whole.  But that is argument for bldg. up reserves v. o.a.p. liability.

	Why shd. we be ashamed of big surplus.



P.M.	But you told public tht. contns were based on actuarial estimate of emplt.  You are now seekg. existg. generation because of full emplt. to pay for future.



G.T.	Conservatism of actuaries.

	Falsificn of their estimates makes it v. diff. to increase contns now.



E.S.	These are initial diffies.  Assumed contns fr. 16 to 60.  Many people entitled to o.a.p. who have never made that contn.

	Over next 20 yrs. initial heavy demand wh. won’t be repeated.



H.D.	No need to discuss now increases comg. in Oct. ’52.  Also rpt. on workg. of scheme before end of year.

	Premature to reach any decision now.

	Needn’t take 7 months to print cards.  Even if it did, unnecessary to show Oct/Dec. contns at higher level.  Cd. be over stamped later.



C.E.	Must print cards in compliance with existg. law. Shd. show increased contns.

	If we show anything suggesting law is liable to be altered.  We shall provoke agitation by pressure groups eg. o.a.p., spinsters etc.



	Comply with the law: and deal with report when it comes up.



E.S.	Quite wrong and confusing to distribute cards with blanks.

	(Generally agreed.)



J.G.	Cards must go out by December.  Can we expedite prepn of report?



R.S.C.	Govt. Actuary’s Rpt. – up to 31.3.50. Can’t expect that report before late autumn.



H.D.	Print cards with lower contn.



H.M.	That wd. imply a decision to reduce contns.

	Don’t funk the proposn tht. people can’t have big benefits w’out big contns.



P.M.	Trouble is tht. we put this fwd. on basis tht. these contns are necessary to these benefits.  And assumptns now disproved.



R.S.C.	Even with £100 m. less charge, Exchequer has to carry over £300 m.

	Even that is more than we can bear.



P.M.	Whatever we do, there will be a row when report published.

	Why not p’pone increase for a time – introduce one Ch. Bill.



A.	Support that suggn.  And then hang on to reserves as now.



H.M.	All this dither is over increase of 2d. a week.

	Real problem is to make public understand future liability on Exchequer.  This Fund isn’t insulated from Exchequer.



P.M.	2d. isn’t nothing. – takg. account of all other deductions fr. wages.



A.B.	Don’t take political knocks for such relatively small sums.

	Reserves at £1.000 m.  And this costs about £16 m.

	And, as before, this is no longer insurance.  Forced savings ploughed into capital investment.  In lieu of taxation.  Is it logical to give income tax relief and increase these contns. 



R.S.C.	But there is a Fund, establd by Act of Parlt. which proceeds on the mathematical basis.

J.G.	General ques. must be settled on report.

	Only practical ques. now is what we do with cards.

	Agreed we can’t leave them blank.

	Can’t print existg. figure w’out implying decn to reduce contn.

	Cd. we therefore arrange somethg. about the printing.



G.A.I.	I believe we cd. print in 2 months.

	

R.S.C.	Print as under existg. law.  Over-print, if requd before issue.  The over-print cd. be done in 2 months.



	Decn on genl. ques. must await report.	)

	Expedite prepn of report.			)    Agreed.



P.M.	Can in its prepn.  Correct old fashioned	[Exit E.S.

	assumptns re health, old age etc.,		[Enter E.B.

							[Enter H.G., M.W.



		4.	Points Rationing.



M.W.	Serious complaints.  Somethg. must be done.  What?

	Inflation of points wd. have intensified mal-distn.  And even 16 points is inflationary amount.



	a)  Mal-distn of supplies.  Wd. take 16 wks. to correct.  Even then,

	b)  Small  households – only 16 points.

	c)  V. rigid system.



	“Fair shares” will be better secured now by control of supplies to retailers – who have interest in fair distn in his desire to keep his regns for other rationing.

	Want authy therefore to withdraw the scheme.



H.W.	Supported w’drawal on last occasion.  When that wasn’t agreed I recommended points inflation.  M/F. hasn’t done that.

	M.W. has even said in H/C. tht. it wd. be silly to do it.



	Agree things are now disorderly.  And even more diff. for Cab. now to take the risk.  On balance, however, I favour w’drawal.



M.W.	I examd suggn and decided not to adopt it.



H.W.	Were B/T consulted?  



M.W.  	Yes : on both occasions.



R.S.C.	Is this a way of getting more sugar?

	Cd. we not discover how much demand exceeds supply of these goods?



H.McN.	Inconsistency betwn. 2 pp.

	Why can’t retailers’ control put it right now?

	If we haven’t enough of these goods, removal of rationg. will sharpen demand. Support R.S.C.

	Wd. have liked experiment in points inflation – even now.



A.V.A.	Offls. in M/F. and in food trade do favour abolition.  But branch managers in Co-op. take opposite view.  They don’t want retailers’ favouritism.



T.W.	Irritn at system is greater than irritn at shortages.

	Can’t be sure of latter.  No doubt about former.

	Support M.W.



E.Sh.	Present scheme can’t work.  But will abolition involve more sugar to avoid irritn.



M.W.	Irritn is none v. scheme.  It wd. then be v. shortage.



H.W.	I still think it’s right to take risk of w’drawal.

	And irritn now increases case for doing so.



H.M.	Savings in adminve costs – in M/F. and food trades.

	Irritation in Parlt.

	On balance, favour takg. the risk.



G.A.I.	Grumbles from housewives.  Support M.W.



M.W.	Sugar.  We are going to ask for more anyhow.  Will have to settle on merits, irrespective of m’taining points system or not.



P.M.	Don’t let Govt. continue to take responsibility for somethg. they can’t control.



H.G.	Don’t say it’s being removed because of abundance.



H.W.	Care to avoid run on shops.



	Memo. approved.



H.McN.	Broke out again.  At least points mean tht. people can’t buy more than their points total.

G.W.	We shall be blamed if things go under counter.



A.	They are under counter now.



H.M.	Much speculation.  P’ponement will give worst of both worlds.



J.	Favour w’drawal of scheme.



P.M.	Explann: can’t run points scheme w’out greater range of goods.



							[Exit M.W., R.S.C.



		5.	Atlantic Council Meeting.



E.B.		1)	Balanced Collective Forces.  Much discn.  I favoured it over 			whole Atlantic area – to get all countries in war fr. outset, work 			to Atlantic Budget, get Ch. and staff of all countries service 			minded.



	Decided: planners must balance natl forces so tht. they will fit in to genl. scheme.  Has now to be worked out in detail.



		2)	Machinery.  Will be Council (Ministers) and Deputies : Team 			of responsible people to work and co-ordinate.

								        

	Agreed U.S. Chairman.  H.Q. in Ldn. – tho’ not all mtgs. in Ldn.



		3)	Declaration.  Officials are now workg. on draft.



		4)	O.E.E.C.  Future arrangemts. for co-ordn in econ. affairs 				after ’52.

			Will submit more detailed picture in memo.

			Will consult G.W. v. informn to Doms.



A.B.	Are we committg. ourselves to spendg. more on Defence?



E.B.	Not finally.  Tho’ we recognise greater defence prepns are requd and must get it by broadening economic basis.



							             [Enter N.B.

		6.	Gas Industry Wage Claim.



N.B.	V. well negotiated.  No publicity.  No repercussions.  Lovely.

	Ques : shd. we accelerate discn on higher paid rates.



A.B.	Can’t we control these Bds?  None of our decisions on earlier occasion have bn. carried into effect.

	As paymts. are to be retrospective, no need to slow down discns.



H.M.	Gas Council went too fast and commd themselves – irrespective of Govt. policy.



	Memo. noted.

	All Bds. to be notified of genl. line to be taken on wage negotns.

		

							                     [Exit A.

		

 

		7.	Coal : Summer Prices.



N.B.	Pre-war practice – differential of 5/=.  Proposed now : 10/=.

	10% of people haven’t space to stock. Some bought eg. for cooking.



A.B.	Prodn Cttee have considered this twice – and no support.

	Proposal is unacceptable politically.  For it = poor people who can’t stock shall pay more in winter so as to bribe rich to stock.

	Our recommn = broadcast advising summer stocking.  If people don’t do so and we have bad winter, say we shall give available coal then to those who cdn’t have stocked.



	Other remedies.  N.C.Ps. were ready to subsidise merchants to stock (£380.000). But have backed out because of fear of demand for similar concessions to other consumers.



A.V.A.	Support N.B.  Nothing new in this to shock housewife.

	A. v. sound scheme.  Para. 14. shows how many of “our people” favour it.  The more the contn you can get from N.C.B. the better.



G.A.I.	Southwark 70% of coal delivered is in ½ cwt. lots.

	Vast areas of Ldn. where no facilities to stock.

	Even new flats have only 2 cwt. space.



P.M.	Compromise?  Can’t you somehow except those who have no space. Register them with merchants?



T.W.	Prodn Cttee weren’t unanimous.  Broadcast?



P.M.	All wd. support differential price as incentive to summer stocking. Can’t you make special plan for those who can’t stock.



G.T.	Limitn of deliveries prevents summer stocking.



N.B.	P.M.’s compromise considered.  Prodn Cttee agreed it was impracticable.

	N.C.B. naturally reluctant to subsidise merchants.              [Re-enter A.

	Merchant subsidy last year was 4/=. paid by Ty.



H.W.	i)  Merchant stocking in certain areas like Ldn. is essential.

	ii) But shortage of distribn labour etc.

	Use threats.  Fear of not getting supplies and priorities.



H.M.	Distribution = summer/winter uneven work.  V. uneconomic.



E.Sh.	Age old problem.  And change of ownership of distn won’t alter it.

	Differential price system has existed for donkey’s years.

	Even with that inducement, people won’t buy for summer stocking.

	On balance, I support N.B.  For no other way of dealing with it.



H.G.	Para.16. Approve i) - iii).  Defer decn on iv) until we have report on total supplies.





		8.	Scottish Affairs.



H.McN.	W.S.C. will not receive the “Commrs”. 3 Tories nominated to do so.

	Presume therefore P.M. shd. not receive.



	Agreed : sufficient for H.McN. to receive them.



	After Cabinet. H.McN had words with H.M., H.G. and P.G.W. about Cttee.



	Suggn of Royal Commn (G.W.) after discussion discarded.



	H.M. and others desired tht. Cttee if it found it practicable to have such a return, shd. produce one – to avoid 2 separate repts.  Pointed out, however, tht. figures wd. have to be presented on Govt. authy. Compromise: public offl. return either simultaneously or as annex to Cttee’s rept.



	Agreed: H.McN. to discuss t. yr. with R.S.C. and H.M. and report to P.M. for final approval.
