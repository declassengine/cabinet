C.M. 57(50)							         11th September 1950



					         [Enter C.O.S., Serv. Ministers., K.Y., H.G.



		1.	United Nations Armed Forces.



K.Y.	This: 3rd limit of U.S. resoln.  Two alternatives a) earmarking. b) F. Legion.  No-one favours (b). Mil. opinion is against it.

	Shd. be no diffy. in edging U.S. off this.   Agreed.

	On a) : ques. for considn is wthr. we wd. work somethg. out with U.S. on these lines for use by ⅔ majority of Assembly – to avoid veto in Sec. Council.  Dare we risk use of such forces, w’out power to veto.

	Fr. Assembly, only recommn.  Only Powers voting for it wd. be commd even morally to supplying a contingent.

		The diffies aren’t considered by F.O. to be decisive.  C.O.S. don’t 	object.

	Pol. grounds for going as far as we can with U.S.

	Mght. be useful in spreading U.N. burden more evenly: in easing domestic diffies eg. of Canada.



	Att.G. raises legal diffies.  Haven’t had time to get advice on these.  But any attempt to get round veto is bound to involve legal diffies.  Many Articles of Charter can be construed broadly or legalistically – may be necessary to take broader constructn eg. tht. jurisdn of S. Council is not exclusion if it is shown to be ineffective.  Aim of policy must be to make Charter more effective w’out driving R. etc., out of U.N.  Hope therefore Cab will authorise E.B. to adopt symp. attitude to U.S. proposal – while we consider how to handle legal diffies.



Att.G.	Memo. puts my genl. view on all of U.S. proposal. Paras. 4-6 deal with this limb of it.  Assembly cd. pass resoln recommdg. nations to ear mark: but only S. Council cd. order those into opern or control them. Charter, properly read, wd. make U.S. proposal as a whole ultra vires And if R. took it to Intern. Ct., we cdn’t resist submn and I believe Ct. wd. rule as above.



P.M.	Accept that view.

	Pact under Art. 51 wd. be preferable?



Att.G.	Yes: legal under Charter, even tho’ R. wdn’t like it.  I suggest Atl. Pact writ large.



A.H.	Counsel caution on this. Att.G. plan by-passes both Assembly of S. Council.  World opinion on Korea which influenced by fact tht. U.N. sanction is behind it.  Need for authoritative voice of U.N.

	Atl. Pact is Regional.



H.M.	Reality is tht. R. may make trouble anywhere at anytime.

	Problem: how to unite peace loving nations on maximum scale.  So long as veto stands, R. can stop effective U.N. action v. aggression.

	What can we do?  To get quickest action.

	How to get earmarked contingents into operation?  Much to be said for Att.G.’s plan.  Doubt if it wd. shock world opinion.



J.	Support Att.G.  His plan is a second best.  Let us bless U.S. plan but look ahead to legal diffies.  And if they prevail fall back on Att.G.’s plan.  Art. 51 method is only sound legal method.  Tho’, if everyone will agree to U.S. plan, we cd. go on with it.



H.D.	Need we do more than tell E.B. of the legal diffies.  May be they will impress U.S. lawyers too.  If they do, action under Art. 51 may be acceptable to them.

	But don’t let’s overlook main objective – of getting the forces earmarked.



Att.G.	Yes: let’s aim at resoln recommendg. tht. forces be held ready and avoid ques. how to order them into action.  Consider that at leisure and choose most legal method.



P.M.	Always recognised int. charter cdn’t prevent aggression by a major Power.  U.S. can’t get round that w’out destroying Charter.



A.B.	Action under Art. 51 wd. break up U.N. as it stands.  Wd. admit tht. U.N. had no effective sanctions.

	Do we forge veto in Art. 51 action?  If so, why do we insist in retaining it in S. Council?

	Suppose R. joined Art. 51 club.  Wd. we want veto then?

	How is force invoked by Art. 51 group?  You don’t avoid that issue by transferring to Art. 51.



Att.G.	We cdn’t ask for veto under Art. 51.

	What we are trying to do is to build collect. security v. aggression by a major Power – for wh. U.N. does not provide.



A.B.	We are seekg. to form a club w’out the Russians.



Att.G.	No.



J.S.	This = delete Atlantic fr. Atlantic Pact.  That wd. mean a change in character.  A. v. big issue.

	Wd. give you	a) U.N. – forum for discn?

			b) Alliance of non Russian Powers.

	Can we jump twds. this?



P.M.	Whole thing is a bit unreal.

	What value in ear marking?  Not effective forces.  What accession of strength.

	Where do you get to – wthr. you try by Assembly resoln of Art. 51.



C.A.S.	Ear marked contingents wd. be a nightmare.

	But don’t want to crab U.S. plans.

	In long run not v. difft. for us, from what we do now.

	We shdn’t prob. send an actual earmarked contingent from a U.K. reserve.

	If you have to increase B.A.O.R. greatly, that wd. conflict with earmarkg. for U.N.



E.Sh.	In detail, impracticable.  Size of Force: command: pay.

	We can’t find enough Forces under Atl. Pact.  Surely we shd. concentrate on that first.  More practical.  Later on, we cd. have a Pact embracing S. Au. states and/or Pacific.  There are diffies even over latter.

	What about our own commitments?  Are all Col. issues barred.

	If our own are, as Att.G. say, what about Indo-China.

	We have no large strategic reserve.

	Let E.B. discuss sympathetically, but no move.



P.M.	Prefer: agree to examine plan, not commit ourselves in principle.



K.Y.	Let E.B. show sympathy.  Acheson wants U.N. sanctions for U.S. action.

	He prob. wdn’t be content with Art. 51 sanction.



P.M.  	Let him discuss.  But don’t get committed in principle.



H.M.	Diff. for us to say in advance how many troops we will make available.

	When time comes, we may be fully committed elsewhere.  And we shd. then have to break faith.



A.B.	That means: the more friends you have the more troops you need.

	Nonsense.  This isn’t increase of commitments.



E.Sh.	Does have effect of increasg. commitments.  The reserve in U.K.



H.D.	Can’t earmark actual units – only a given force.



P.M.	Give E.B. warning of view expd.

	Sympathy – no agreemt. in principle.

			Promise to consider details.



G.W.	This wd. facilitate action by S. Doms., who need U.N. sanction.



A.B.	E.B. shd. go as far as possible to find means of  [sic]



H.M.	Art. 51.  We are now in situation in wh. so long as veto is there, U.N. will be ineffective v. R. aggression.  We must look at that situation.

	Suppose R. struck in M/E., where Atl. Pact doesn’t apply.

	Give notice tht. we shd. discuss this v. soon.



			Want to consider gain.   Thursday.

		2.	Employment of National Service Men.	[Exit Att.G.



J.S.	As in memo.

	Under 2 yrs. N.S., the old rule won’t exclude, as it used to, emplt. of N.S. men in distant theatres.



C.A.S.	C.O.S. endorse.



H.	In R.N. we have for generations sent boys to sea – 17 or 17½ and upwds. on operations.  We must be left out of this.



E.Sh.		Not intended tht. this rule shd. cover R.N.



H.		Don’t intend to send N.S. men to F/East.



E.Sh.	Combat Pay.  Ques. will be raised in debate wthr. they shd. be paid at regular rates after 12 mos via. 18 mos.



H.D.	Equal pay on active service.  But not after 12 mos.



H.G.	Will examine that.



H.M.	Don’t get committed to that.  Case for increased pay was to attract regular merits.



P.M.	No decision without memo.   



A.V.A. 	Early decision required because Nally’s amendmt.



H.D.	Footnote on Malaya.  Under 19.  There will be trouble over that.



J.S.	Has bn. discussed and defended in H/C.  No need to run away fr. existg. decision on that.



	

		3.	Defence Debate.			     [Exit C.O.S., A.H., J.S.

								      [Enter W.W. and G.S.

W.W.	Business statement may be necessary tomorrow.

	If Party willing to pass Bill on Friday – might finish by end/wk.

	Opposn might raise debate on Iron and Steel on last day.



P.M.	I will open.  E.Sh. and H.G. will speak.  May want another Minister – G.S., or K.Y. or a Service Minister.



H.	H/L. propose to meet Tues and Wed.  Putting this to Opposition, who are expected to agree.  Debate on Defence.



	Will be diff. to pass Bill on Saty because King at Balmoral.

	We shd. prefer to do it on Tuesday followg.  H/C. wd. have to meet that day.

							                       [Exit W.W.



		4.	Control of Strategic Exports to E. Europe and China.



E.Sh.	Put conclusions set out on p. 2 of memo.

	On (b) – effect on natl economy both by loss of export earnings and by danger to our essential imports fr. these countries.



T.W.	On (3) – will R. be told soon of our intentn to requisition?



G.S.	Won’t be finished for 2/3 months.

	But looks as tho’ it was sold to Poland under agreement wh. specifies no Govt. interference.

	Only an example of requisitiong. policy.  Lots of others, probably will be needed.



P.M.	Can’t w’hold informn fr. H/C. for long.



H.W.	Poles may cut up rough over breach of contract, Governmentally.

	R. have had no assurances v. export licences.  P. were given assurance tht. Govt. wdn’t stand in way of shipment.

	To do so wd. give Poles a big propaganda weapon.



E.Sh.	Craven Bros. emerged fr. W.S.C.’s b’cast.  I thght therefore we shd. implement existg. contracts and requisition etc. fr. now on.



H.W.	L.O.’s will be consulted on Craven tool because of Policy agreement.



H.G.	What is to be said in debate?

	Is recommn (1) subject to (2)?



H.W.	Line will be: shan’t allow exports to interfere with our own re-armament and requisitiong. will be used “in appropte cases.”



G.S.	Trouble will arise over things wh. are of value to R. and aren’t wanted by us.



H.G.	Are recommns 4) and 5) to be made public?



A.B.	Are they consistent with last Cab. decision?

	What of retaliatory action by R?  Will U.S. compensate us?



H.W.	This was aimed at orders in excess of normal trade – huge orders eg. for wire.  We can stall on those, and prevent export of undue quantities.  Somethg. to that effect cd. be said.

	On (6)  E.B. will be discussg. with U.S. – can’t expect total blockade.

	Must make it clear to U.S. tht. we look to them to see us thro’ if R. retaliates.



G.W.	Shall continue to keep Dom. Govts informed.
