C.M. 39(50)							27th June 1950



		1.	Schuman Plan – Debate.

						          [Enter G.S., H.G., N.B.: R. Makins



P.M.	R.S.C. made good case – we had better of debate.



R.S.C.	W.S.C. may upset his Party by going too far in dirn of Fedn.

	A.E. was reasonable.



P.M.	May address himself mainly to Labour Party pamphlet.

	My task will be to bring debate back to real issue.

	Times has publd much of Fr. proposals.



R.S.C.	Our informn about them has bn. obsd in confidence and can’t be used.



H.D.	A.E. gave guarded reply when pressed.  Cd. P.M. tempt W.S.C. into un-guarded answer.

							[Enter R. Makins.



G.W.	W.S.C. alleged tht. Fr. Govt. supported “our amendment”.  Massigli was saying the same in lobby. 



R.S.C. 	Serious notice shd. be taken of that.



R.M.	Was suggd to us unofficially in negotns tht. we might adopt same line as Dutch.  Was never put to us officially.



R.S.C.	It was not Monnet’s view.



P.M.	Let R.S.C. try to get A.E. to stop W.S.C. from repeatg. this.



A.	W.S.C.’s main case will be tht. we haven’t bn. helpful – shd. have taken initiative.



R.M.	i)  For 2 wks. before Fr. announcemt. we were in closest consultns with 	French on Franco-G. ques. and not a word was said.

	ii)  To improve Fr. G. relatns only people who cd. take initiative were 	French.



A.B.	Decln. of Internatl. Socialist Conference is an answer to pamphlet criticism.

	Refer to financial plans for expansion – no word of that yet.

	For capital expn in Europe some new financial injectn is necessary if inflation is to be avoided.



H.G.	Turns on A.E.’s words “subject to necessary safeguards and condns”.  This is crucial weakness of Tory Opposn.



R.S.C.	Care over that – it cd. have bn. done that way : acceptg. principle. Dutch did.



H.McN.	Supported R.S.C.



P.M.	Our main objn must be to supra-natl authy.



H.D.	And stress defence considns in that connection.



J.G.	T.U.C. and Unions have exprd gt. concern.  T.U.C. will prob. pronounce on it today.



N.B.	Miners also v. anxious for internatl. arrangemt. as protn v. slumps and raising wages all round.  Fear of competn We can welcome internatl arrangemt.



R.S.C.          *	In O.E.E.C. it broke down because Belgians said tht. cdn’t control their steel industry.

						[Exit N.B. and G.S.

						[Enter M.W.

		2.	White Fish Industry.



T.W.	Prodn Cttee approved Bd. in principle.

	Smaller mtg has discussed subsidy.

	Circulated draft answer.  Verbal amendments approved.



P.M.	Not much comfort in this.



H.McN.	Agree: that is why I urged subsidy – but no one wd. agree with me.

	Subsidy of £3 - 3½ m. p.a. is near: middle water fishermen.



H.W.	Considered at a mtg. last night – all Ministers save H.McN. were against it.

	And H.McN. admitted it was only to buy time pendg. legn of foreign landings etc.



P.M.	But promise of future legn doesn’t help.



T.W.	1.900 fishermen unempld in Grimsby alone.

	Our purpose in suggestg. subsidy was to help in m’taining existg. catches pending O.E.E.C. discn and long-term policy.

	But other Ministers didn’t support it.



R.S.C.	You didn’t advocate subsidy.

	Disastrous to try to buy off this sort of posn with a subsidy.  It will put no-one in work.  If you give more to put them in, the prices will go lower still.



E.Sh.	Problem: under-consumption not over-prodn.  Subsidies won’t touch that.

P.M.	Are we sure tht. we can stick to this line?



H.D.	Don’t announce today – Korea and Schuman.



H.W.	Let M/D. get Services to eat more fish.  But long-term.



P.M.	If we are going to give subsidy in reply to pressure, I don’t want to refuse it today.



E.Sh.	Willing to play my part in an “Eat More Fish” campaign.



H.M.	Ought we to restore price control? (minimum price).

	    “       “   “  restrict foreign landings?

	This looks rather hurried ……..



P.M.	Put this off.



H.D.	Stimulate demand.



R.S.C.	M/F. think there’s little to be done.



H.G.	Fish has done v. well for years: and dropping now because other foods available.

	Can’t subsidise indies for dropping demand.

	There may be case for reducg. subsidies to eggs and meat and transferring it to fish.  Then: not on grounds of helping a distressed industry.



T.W.	Can’t alter Feby review w’out amending legn.



P.M. 	I will promise a statement next Tuesday.

	Services to say by then how much more they can eat.

	M/F. to consider stimulatg. consumption.



R.M.	Discns in O.E.E.C. will be v. diff – esp. with our Scandinavian friends.



R.S.C.	Truth is: industry must contract.



H.W.	Also distn is bad – fish still costs consumer too much.

	Special enquiry now into fish distn.



P.M.	Let D. and M. Cttee look at this.



R.S.C.	A subsidy if given will go largely to distributors.



P.M.	Special Cabinet this week.





		

 

		3.	Marginal Land.



P.M.	As in my brief.



R.S.C.	Also puts up value of land – extra capital value will go to owner.  Shd. be provision ensurg. tht. extra value accrues to State, or at least to farmer.



H.M.	“Stock breeding land” via “marginal land”.

	Exhibited some pictures – before and after.

	Some of this wd. do us more good than higher prices for food imports.



A.B.	Shd. this be pre-digested by Cab. Cttee?	[Exit R.M., M.W., H.G.





						[Enter W.S., Att.Gen. K.Y.

		4.	Korea.



K.Y.	i)  Holmes has given me copies of  telegrams fr. State Dpt.  Sent to all N. Atlantic Powers, Austr. India. N.Z.  Read out longer of these.



	Fleet action to forestall attack on Formosa.

	Re-inforcement of Phillipines.

	Mil. aid to Indo-China.

	Announcement 27/6 at 12 noon E.D.T. = 5 pm G.M.T.



	ii)  Telegram to U.K. Govt. only v. resoln in Security Council recommendg. U.N. members to give such aid to S. Korea as will enable it to repel attack.



	iii)  Read also message fr. U.N. Mission to S. Korea.  No contact possible earlier with N. Korea.  Rapid deteriorn: N. Korea won’t heed Sec. Council resoln or accept our offices.  Suggest they be asked to accept mediator etc. (as in this a.m.’s Times).

	In reply to R.S.C. – both N. and S. Korea have applied to U.N. for membership and neither has bn. accepted.  But electns etc. mean tht. S. Korea has bn. recognised by U.N.



P.M.	This action by U.S. links up S. Korea with no. of matters not before

                   x/	Sec. Council at all.



A.B.	Also reversed China policy, w’out consultg. us.  Ready to defend Formosa v. regime recognised by us.



R.S.C.	Sec. Council havg. asked N. Koreans to w’draw and asked all members to render assistce in execution – U.S. action is consequent on that, so far as S. Korea is concerned.

 

K.Y.	Also Art. 51. entitles friends to come to aid of nation attacked.  That wd. be easier argument for U.S. to use.  And they will follow up with 2nd resoln.

	E.B. thinks we must support 2nd resoln.

	On x/. E.B. doubts wthr. we shd. publicly say anything to isolate Korean incident fr. others because don’t want discourage U.S. support in our diffies in Malaya and Fr. in Indo-China.

	Refce to civil war as instrument of policy – in his last F.A. debate.

	But stick to what U.N. authorises – don’t go outside it.

	Defiance of U.N. and Sec. Council resoln can’t do less than support 2nd resoln.  But on those grounds.  And advise U.S. to stick to those grounds.

	U.S. statement designed for release before Sec. Council meets.

	Text and time will be known by 2.30 p.m.



A.B.	We shd. certainly support U.N. on S. Korea.

	But Soviet haven’t identified themselves with N. Korean action: and we might have avoided affront to Soviet.

	But Truman’s decln opens offensive v. Soviet Union.  W’out consultn with interested Powers.  Gives R. no chance to w’draw.

	May be calling a bluff: but cd. have bn. called in S. Korea alone: w’out takg. this enormous risk.



E.Sh.	Telegram fr. Moscow last night.  U.S. Amb. instructed to call on R. to disavow interest in N. Korea and urge them to w’draw their troops etc.

	U.S. have taken other action as well.

	Also telegram from Tedder.  We replied to him last night askg. following ques. re military situation.  His reply received.

	S. Korean resistance has collapsed.  Bradley’s view: if U.S. air had bn. given free hand attack cd. have bn. held, but too late now to restore military situation.  R. instructors are with N. Koreans – 3.000 (500 U.S. left in South K.).  No policy decision on Formosa.  Addendum: next move is Iran: early U.S./U.K. concerted plan on that.



P.M.	Throwing down major challenge, in mood of levity, to U.S.S.R.  And unnecessarily, for cd. have bn. limited to S. Korea.



H.M.	V. important point in history.  Likely beginnings of ’39 – Jap. attack on Manchuria.  Ques: what is the point at wh. you make it clear you aren’t putting up with it.

	Doubtless Truman thght tht. w’out immed. action S. Korea wd. have bn. over-run and Soviet wd. have got away with mil. aggression. Once that is conceded there’s no stopping them.

	Firmness is only thing likely to stop R.

	We can’t refuse to support the resolution.



R.S.C.	Qua Korea and support of U.N. – we agree we must go all out.

	Ques : can we do anything to stop U.S. linking this up with Formosa.

	V. serious for us in H. Kong.

	No refce to Malaya.

	We shall have to comment today.



H.McN.	Nothg. can be done now to save S. Korea.

	Does R.S.C. suggest attack on N. Korea?



P.M.	It isn’t wording.  Bite in U.S. statement is action taken, wh. is not related to S. Korea as such.



A.V.A.	U.S. purpose is to give due notice to R. tht. they won’t run into Formosa and Indo-China while eyes are directed to S. Korea.  They are concentratg. their strategy.



E.Sh.	I think U.S. are right. Risks, no doubt: but greater risks in not doing this.

	Fatal if we don’t respond.

	Don’t fall foul of U.S. just when they are keyed up to act boldly.

	Doesn’t commit us to mil. action save at request of U.N.



K.Y.	Read F.O. draft of tel. to U.S. Govt. – deprecatg. refce to “centrally directed Comm. imperialism”: allowg. Formosa etc. action to speak for themselves.

	Allows Sov. to climb down.



A.B.	But do we believe U.S. action v. Formosa etc. is right.

	We must keep R. in the wrong throughout.



J.	If we can’t get U.S. to alter their decn (and time alone prevents it) don’t let it appear there is any division of opinion betwn. us.

	Whatever we say to them in private, let there be no open division on policy betwn. them.



A.B.	U.K. faced with succession of coups d’etat: first Schuman and now Truman.  We shd. be consulted by U.S. at least, before we are exposed to air attack in U.K.



H.W.	Also: make sure preamble to resolution doesn’t include references to Formosa etc.

	Comm. Govts. shd. know our views at once.



P.M.	Jebb. shd. go out to N. York.



		Early appreciation by C.O.S.
