C.M. 49(50)							                   24th July 1950



		1.	Mackenzie King.	     [Enter H., W.W., Att.Genl., Wheatley									      K.Y.

P.M.	All precedents v. mentioning his death in Parlt.

	We shd. refrain.

	I have put out a message.

	

R.S.C.	Cd. we not, as Cabinet, send a message to St. Laurent?



P.M.	Yes.





		2.	Explosion at Portsmouth.



H.	Gave informn showg. latest results of enquiry.



P.M.	Men there have bn. given demonstn of similar explosion – they say this is what happened.  No doubt this was sabotage.



	Read draft of Parly statement.



	Wd. this be covered by Malicious Damage Act? 



Att.G.  	Yes.  And if w’in dockyard, it wd. be capital offence.

	Draft Bill cd. not be justified as necessary for P’smouth.  But other incidents of sabotage might occur for which Bill wd. be necessary.





		3.	Interference with Military Supplies.



P.M.	Shd. consider passing this Bill tomorrow, as matter of urgency.



C.E.	Diffy. of drafting due to fact tht. there is no known enemy – intentn can’t be based on criterion of assistg. the enemy.



		Cl. 3: Propaganda.  Reserved for special Cab. decision. not personally 		in favour of it, because proviso wd. make conviction v. diff. to obtain.

		Might be of some use in terrorism.

	Form of Bill: unlike E.P.(D) Act, powers are specified in Act itself.

	Parlt will have pronounced on them.  Avoids any argument tht. Executive is going beyond intentns of Parlt.



	Para. 5(c).  Shall have to concede affirmation resoln if point is pressed in Parlt.



P.M.	Cl. 1(1) – why only 2-7.



R.S.C.	The other sections will be in force, as part of genl. law, throughout.



P.M.	Cl. 3. Will give unnecessary trouble?



R.S.C.	Cdn’t you cover this under incitement?



Att.G.	No: general propaganda wdn’t be incitement.

	Don’t think Cl. 3 as drafted is v. useful.  Wd. prefer to go wider – if anyone with intent to help publishes anything prejudicial +  proviso.

	W’out this, we shan’t have powers we had in war to deal with propaganda.  And situation may be as serious.



A.B.	Parlt. wdn’t pass the Bill with Cl. 3 in.

	We must be careful.  Cl. 2(4) – lawful strike.



Att.G.	Unofficial strike is just the weapon that is likely to be used.



P.M.	a)  Wd. raise old bogies of 1927 Act.  b) Implies No. 1305 wd. be permanent.



R.S.C.	b) isn’t a good point – wd. mean what is “lawful” for the time being.



E.Sh.	Ques.: do we pass Bill now, or introduce it as a warning and leave it until we meet again – when we cd. stiffen or modify it as circs. warrant.

	I am inclined to favour second course.



P.M.	If there were then unoffl strike, you wd. have to recall Parlt. to pass the Bill.



E.Sh.	On merits, you prob. shd. do so.

	Concerned at Comm. action.  Two examples – a) Ihrenberg shdn’t have bn. allowed to spk. in Trafalgar Square at this time.  b) Mtg. of Comms. in E. Zone of Germany.  Pollitt is going there.  Shd. he have bn. allowed to go?



H.M.	Cd. have bn. done under existg. powers.

	Use of Bill as a threat.  Wd. expose us to criticism of being un-serious.

	I favour makg. P’smouth announcement and then saying we must have further power.



A.B.	Even so, Parlt. won’t pass it in a hurry even w’out Cl. 3.

	What we really want is powers to make Orders, subject to Parlt.

                   x/	confirmn.

	Associated Powers.  Wd. it cover Egypt?



R.S.C.	No need for Govt to apply it to Egypt.



H.M.	As much criticism against x/.  



R.S.C.  	And less effective: for Parlt. wd. have to be sitting.



A.B.	Suppose it’s true tht. U.S. have less powers than us.

	Unwise for us to be first of all Powers to take this action.

	

H.McN.	If we rush this thro’ we must be sure it’s effective.

	If we accept need for affirmve resoln, Bill wd. be no use in Recess.

	We can’t rush this Bill at same time resist affve resoln.



C.E.	Wd. give us 7 days.  And we shd. re-call Parlt. if we wanted to use it.



R.S.C.	Pass a short and simple Act – amend it in Oct, if need be.

	Omit Cl. 3.  Consider modifying Cl. 2(4) to avoid controversy even if loop-hole is left.  Worst case wd. be to introduce this and fail to get it thro’.



C.E.	Attach special importance to Cl. 2(4).

	Unofficial strike = main menace.



Att.G.	Most useful provn in Bill.  You cd. prosecute those who incited others to strike v. a Union.



R.S.C.	No: this saving applies only to those taking part, not to instigator.

	Omit “lawful”.		

							           [Exit Hall.



P.M.	Not capable of dealing with complicated issue much more simply.



R.S.C.	You cd. limit it to Cl. 5 in events of Cl. 2.  Deal only with incitement.



Wh.	Incitement.  Wd. be diff. to prove intent. (Cl. 2. intent), if limited to incitement.

	W’out somethg. about strikes, Bill wd. be useless.



J.G.	Who settles wthr. a strike is lawful or not?  What do we mean?



P.M.	Omit Cl. 3.    Agreed.



H.M.	Preamble.  Effect in limiting Cl. 1? Limited to world peace: does this mean it doesn’t apply to eg. Malaya.



Att.G.	May be undue emphasis on coll. security.  Designed to give it an air of respectability.



J.	Better delete preamble.



Att.G.	I like it.



H.D.	On merits, shd. be wide enough to cover routine supplies eg. to Malta, when action opns going on elsewhere.



P.M.	Isn’t “may be engaged” enough to cover that.

Att.G.	No: it’s Cl. 2, not Cl. 1, that matters for this purpose.



J.	And on Cl. 2(2) it doesn’t arise at all.



J.	Bring it in as operatg. for 6 months only.  An emergency measure.

	Adjust later, when more time is available.



E.Sh.	Not a simple Bill – it’s controversial – lawful strike etc., view of T.UC.



R.S.C.	Depends on Cl. 2(4) – main element of controversy.  Ask T.U.C.?



A.B.	Power to deal with P’smouth.  No evce of any further dangers – Strike ques. v. diff.



J.G.	Don’t take powers you can’t enforce.



P.M.	Consult T.U.C. if we are to proceed at all.

	If necessary, re-call House to legislate.



C.E.	My anxiety: inflammatory speeches may lead men to do things dangerous to safety of citizens as well as State.



R.S.C.	Incitement to sabotage – mainly covered by existg. law.



Att.G.	Easier to prove under Cl. 2(1).



R.S.C.	Then confine legn to that.



P.M.	Consult T.U.C. on Cl. 2(4).  – L.P.  F.A.I. and Att.G.

	Cabinet can consider again.
