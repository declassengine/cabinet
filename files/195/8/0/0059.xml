C.M. 5(51).				        22nd January, 1951.



	1.	Service Courts Martial.            [Enter  Att.G., J.S., Hall, Crawley,

			                                                    Wheatley.



E.Sh.	Shd. we on the Bill, make decln of intention on these other ques.?

		H/C. expect it.  No alternative but to do so.

	White Paper?  Yes.  But before 2nd Rdg. debate?  Maybe we shd. hear

		views of H/C. before deciding, on these ques. on wh. opinion

		does not necessarily follow Party lines.

	The three issues.

		a)	Civilian lawyer as President.  We reject this.

		b)	Unanimity findings.  We reject this also.  Wd. be 

			     impracticable in war - &amp; to some extent in overseas

			     stations in peace.

		c)	Other ranks repn.  Wd. attract some support.  And A.H.

			     believes in it.  Possibly J.S. favours it.  If we can show

			     tht., by new appeal procedure, serving men will

			     have same safeguards as civilians I believe we can 

			     satisfy most reasonable opinion.



P.M.	(a)	Civilian President.



H.	Admy support memo.  In peace, 80-90% of cases are disciplinary.  Nos.

		are small:  down now to 83 p. annum.  Pilcher Cttee have upheld

		workg. of naval courts-martial.  Expendre of providing civilian

		presidents wd. not be justified.



J.S.	Unnecessary if we get appeal procedure.



A.C.	We support.	Agreed.



	b)	Unanimity Findings.



J.	Depends on analogy of Judge &amp; Jury.  If we follow procedure of

		Justices court, no need to introduce unanimity.

	Ct./appeal may bring out new problems.  Can’t answer them now.

		Let ct/appeal get to work:  if it discloses deficiencies we can

		remedy them.



Att.G.	Ct./appeal can’t review findings on fact.

	But I support proposal in memo.



Wh.	No case for modifying status quo.

	This is separate code:  can’t apply civil analogues too narrowly.

	Anyway, agree with J. re analogy of Justices court.

				                          Agreed.

E.Sh.	Procedure of reviewg. authority goes on – accused will get

		2 remedies.

	

 

	c)	Other Rank Representation.



J.S.	I was attracted – justice shd. seem to be done.

	But not recommended by either Cttee.  I was ready to accept majority

		view of my colleagues – at this stage.



A.Cr.	Att. still favours experiment – on U.S. basis, of giving accused option

		to ask for other rank repn.  Assocn with U.S. Forces might 

		sharpen demand for it.



P.M.	Any evce tht. other ranks want it?



E.Sh.	No.



Att.G.	Favour Att. view.



P.M.	Cd. we give the option?



C.E.	How select the other rank repve?

	How be sure of a man who wd. stand up to view taken by officers?

	In some Services, custom to ask junior offr. to give his view first.

(P.M.    	In all services).  A big strain to ask the private to give his view first.

             	This points to a v. seasoned Sergt. Major.  And wd. that help accused?



A.B.	N. Health Service appeal tribunals are so constituted as to include a 

		“peer” of accused.

	Awkward to reject this.



P.M.	I incline twds. giving U.S. option.



J.	Against interests of accused.  Other ranks will be more severe.



Wh.	Remember we have removed diffce betwn. special &amp; ordinary jurors.

		No “class distinction” in civil juries.

	If it’s true tht. presence of other ranks wd. be v. interest of accused,

		they wdn’t opt for it.

	Real diffy:  where do you select other rank repn from &amp; how.



H.	No demand for this.  No advocacy of it in either Cttee.

	V. unpleasant for lower-deck man in a ship.  Diff. in Navy to draw

		the man from “another unit”.



H.D.	Diff. to lag behind U.S. in superficial democracy.

	------------------

				                    [Enter  E.B.

				

J.S.	Wdn’t affect decisions.  Might give other ranks more confidence.

		If views of Cttees are not a bar - &amp; we are turning down some of

		their recommns – I think there’s much to be said for it.



H.G.	Politically diff. for us to reject this if pressed in H/C.



		Agreed:  leave this ques. open, &amp; consider U.S. practice.





	Announcement of Decisions.



H.M.	I wd. prefer to publish Wh. Paper before debate.  More s’forward.



E.Sh.	Wd. rather avoid definite line.



P.M.	Let us settle our line on Thursday on the 3rd point.



	Naval Discipline Bill.



H.M.	Don’t promise anything this Session.

				[Exit invitees.



	2.	Fire Services in War.



C.E.	As in memo.  Para. 8 commended.  L.a.’s will be satisfied with that.



H.McN.	Nothing to add.  My l.a.’s wd. accept this.



H.M.	Agree.  “So far as this Govt. is concerned” – wd. meet it.



H.D.	No objn.



A.B.	Do you contemplate 2 Services, under para. 8.



C.E.	No.  A single Service.

				[Enter  C.A.S. &amp; Elliot.

				            K.Y.

	3.	Korea.



E.B.	Sponsoring.  Decided, with P.M., not to co-sponsor.  I shall drop that.

		Consider only wtr. we shall vote for U.S. resoln.	Agreed.

	At A.’s request, read out terms of U.S. resolution.

	Problem:  what consequences.

	U.K. attitude to Resolution.

	i)	Condemnation of Ch. action in Korea.  They have commd 

		aggression in K.  Can’t deny it, as a fact.  Diffy:  what follows, if

		decln of aggression made?  We have promised support of action

		v. aggression in Korea.  But are we ready to support action 

		elsewhere v. China?  Under this resoln:  U.S. may w’draw fr.

		Korea &amp; carry attack v. China, a declared aggressor.  That wd. 

		create new &amp; dangerous situation.  Wd. involve us in much 

		bigger affair.  My view is:  militarily unwise to get into that 

		position.  It might involve transportg. Ch. K. Shek&apos;s forces to

		m’land:  fomentg. new civil war, in wh. we wd. be supportg.

		C.K.S. v. Commts.  Doubt if Comm. wd. support us in that.

	ii)	Nehru says door not shut &amp; claims we can still negotiate.

		Told my repve in Peking to try to clear up ambiguity in Ch. reply.

			viz., no cease-fire w’out precedg. negotns:   but don’t say

			what such negotns wd. be about.  Is it local sitn of Armies:

			or the long term issues re F/East.  If latter, we cdn’t accept.

			If former only, another matter:  certainly then we shdn’t be

			justified in launchg. major war on China.  No reply yet

			received.  Might be wise to defer final decision until we

			know.



P.M.	Krishna tells me Pannikar has received followg. from Peking Govt. –

		Accept cease-fire in principle.  Negotns for it &amp; discns must be

		settled before cease-fire.  Venue:  China – not of gt. importce.

		Suggest H. Kong as alternative.



E.B.	iii)	China fears tht. once cease-fire accepted, negotns will be dragged

		on.  In U.S., serious war psychosis.  They don’t want to deal with

		Comm. China – don’t want to speak to them.  They poured

		money into China:  missionaries &amp; social work etc:  and look

		at results.  Many understandgs. between. F.D.R. &amp; Ch. K. Shek.

		A long b’ground.  They feel Chinese nation has let them down –

		shown ingratitude.

	iv)	Must find means of handling this so as to avoid breach with U.S.

		Against this b’ground, consider Tel. 205 fr. W’ton.  This is what

			they think Resoln wd. empower them to do.

		Coll. Measures Cttee – gt. power.  Majority of states favouring

			U.S. point of view.  ⅔rd majority rule, &amp; still only 

			recommendatory:  but v. diff. for us to oppose such 

			recommns once made.  Considg. wtr. any tighter safeguards

			can be devised to ensure tht. action doesn’t automaty follow 

			on recommns of this Cttee.  Must keep our discretion re U.K.

			action in this field.

		Defer final decision until to-morrow because of iii) above.

		V. awkward for Jebb., who must speak to-day.  May I authorise

			him to condemn the aggression:  but to resort to any means

			of ensurg. negotns to avert war:  U.K. seekg. clarificn of Ch.

			reply:  promise further speech to-morrow.

		M’while Sweden, France etc., are askg. for a lead from us.



P.M.	Decln of U.S. policy twds. China – as stated on b’cast this morning.

		V. dangerous.



E.B.	May be initiative of a P.R.O.



H.McN.	Gross said earlier Nat. China must be included in any conference

		on F/E.

E.B.	They wd. throw him over, if it suited them.





C.A.S.	a)  Korea.  Remains U.S. policy to stay:  but they explain why they

		can’t.  Only 50 mile perimeter at best:  and doubt if they’ll hold

		that.  Ridgway said he cd. stay 2/3 months.  But since I left, 

		MacA. &amp; others have taken more optimistic view.

	They gave me impn they didn’t want to stay in Korea.

		a)  They think Ch. cd. push them out if they tried.

		b)  They fear continuing commitmt there.

	We are now back again in uncertainty.

	Ridgway has toughened things up.  Ch. will be affected increasingly

		by U.N. air attack.



	b)  Future action.  They are hurt at Ch. ingratitude.  Talkg. of 

		“retaliation.”  Strong pol. pressure.  But that may pass –

		it often does.

	Tel. 205.  Last Wed., mtg. of Nat. Sec. Council – to decide what next.

		No v. firm conclns – messy mtg.  Our views were taken into a/c.

		Genl. conclns “just about along lines of your thinking” (Bradley).

	They said:	  i)  no action of Resoln until out of Korea.

			 ii)  “establishg. a posn ” didn’t mean decisions on action:

			            promised to consult us first.

		i) gives us some time.

	They stressed need to avoid breach between. Comm. &amp; U.S.  Want to

		be in same boat.  Danger, qua Eisenhower &amp; Europe, of any 

		U.K. action wh. inflamed U.S. public opinion at this time.

	Doubt if they will go in for bombing of China – save prs. if U.S.

		evacuating troops were under v. heavy attack.  They don’t want

		to extend the war.

	Selective sanctions – Sherman.  He didn’t favour naval blockade.  He

		wanted some selective embargo, thro’ licensing control at ports

		+ navicert system.  Wanted joint examn of that:  but p’poned mil.

		side of it.

	Chang. K. Shek.  Apart fr. Bradley’s enquiry (how wd. we regard

		using his troops to support stabilised line in Korea) no 

		responsible U.S. authority seems to favour puttg. them into

		mainland of China.

	Continuing U.K./U.S. consultn.  State Dpt. &amp; Harriman wd. like it.

		But State &amp; War Dpts. can’t co-operate in this sort of thing.



H.M.	Don’t slam any door on negotns with Chinese.

	Coll. Measures Cttee sounds dangerous.

	Must consider our position v. carefully:  even to point of expressing

		some diffce of view with U.S.



A.B.	Urgent ques. this a.m. – is line Jebb shd. take.



P.M.	Read draft telegram to Jebb.



A.B.	If he says aggression has bn. commd, we are commd to voting for

		resolution.  Wd. much prefer him to condemn Ch. for failg. to

		send more conciliatory reply.  Don’t get on slippery slope.

		Don’t prejudge our decision.



H.G.	Aim:  get negotns going:  but nothg. to discourage U.S. from hanging

		on in Korea.  We shall never get settlement if U.N. troops

		w’draw.

	Jebb wd. be drawing distinction betwn. collective action &amp; its dangers

		&amp; admittg. fact of aggression.  Support general line of draft

		telegram.

	Anyway, Jebb has condemned the aggression already.



H.D.	Support the draft.  V. important to delete statemt. tht. China have 

		rejected offer.



J.	U.S. resoln assumes continuing U.N. action in Korea.

	Support that, but keep away fr. collective measures para.



A.B.	Let Jebb say nil. to prejudice our vote on resoln.



H.McN.	Need he speak to-day?  He won’t say any more than he has done 

		already.  Let conversns go on in W’ton.



E.B.	We can’t avoid condemnation of aggression.



P.M.	Moral attitude:   must condemn aggression.

	What can you do about it?  Another matter.  Esp. aggression by one

		of big 5 – whose aggression U.N. Charter never purported to

		deal with.



E.B.	“….. aggression:  but n’withstandg. that, U.N. offered negotn &amp; regret

		Chinese have not yet accepted that.”

	If he has to speak to-day.



E.B.	P.M. of Canada also asked China for elucidation.

	Has had a reply – wh. is not unconciliatory.
