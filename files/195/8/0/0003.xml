C.M. 29(50)							                     8th May 1950



		1.	Tourist Accommodation 1951.	[Enter B., M.W., R.R.S.



H.M.	F/Britain Office v. anxious.  Council (incldg. all pol. Parties) feel alarmed.

	Not enough hotels in Ldn.  Developmt. held back because investmt. p’mme. – for some people wd. be willing to build if they could.

	Private accommn, incldg. boarding houses, will be tried.  Was successful in F/Edinburgh.

	Requisitioned hotels, incldg. Gt. Central.

	Service Dpts. asked if accommn available for youngsters.

	Deep shelter at Clapham might also be used for young – W.T.A. to run.

	

	Endorse proposals of B/T.



	Catering Wages Bd. – heavy burden on hotel managemt.  Cd. enquiry launched into that be expedited.  Some concession, here or elsewhere, is essential if people are to risk money in hotel business.

	Danger of Festival being discredited in advance.  Cooks in N. York have already thght. it necessary to warn clients off.

	Want directions in principle to Dpts. to co-operate, unless over-riding objns in any particular case.



H.W.	Strain on hotels – x/ due mainly to increased U.S. traffic since devaluation.

	Requisitioned hotels – much done in last few months.  M/W. v. active.

	Believe Rlways Executive cd. be more accommodatg. on Gt. Central.

	New bldg. For some yrs. post-war no disposn to build.  But in last 2/3 months more signs of readiness to build – because i) x/ above  ii) hope of easement of catering wages.  Purchase tax deters : but B/T. and Ty. considg. easement of this on dollar-earning expre.

	Carlton project : satisfied there isn’t a reasonable financial return.

	More profitable to build offices.  Another Knightsbridge scheme is in same case.  Don’t believe new hotels will be built w’out financial guarantee.

	In 1951 we may have to take direct action to reserve accommn for dollar tourists : for pressure of U.K. trippers to Ldn. will be v. strong. Latter must be drained off to boardg. houses, private accommn etc.

	Clapham shelter must be kept open.

	Suburban hotels (ques. by P.M.) have bn. brought under review.

	2 Park St.  G.H.F. are lookg. for other premises.  If they find them, handg. this over as annex to luxury hotel in neighbourhood wd. help.



R.R.S.	Tendency to go for offices etc., is due to extra profit from that.

	Believe we may have to restrict use on de-requisitioning.

	Carlton. B. Smith willing to run it, but won’t put up money.

	2 Park St.  Cd. be made to pay, for dollar tourists, if we had licence.

	Wd. give another 25/40 beds for U.S. tourists

	Can’t build new hotels in time for Festival.

	Clapham – W.O. condn is return at 24 hrs’ notice.  Shd. get over that.



J.	Don’t concentrate overmuch on Ldn.  Big country houses cd. be organised.

	House nr. Winchester with 21 bedrooms for £6.000.



G.A.I.	Catering Wages enquiry is going as fast as it can.  Hold up for a month at outset because trade not ready with evidence.



B.	Rlway Executive.  I told them not to buy property, but to use own.

	Got Gt. Central Hotel out of Service Dpts, with gt. diffy.  Not practicable now to turn them out – they have nowhere else to go.  We haven’t even bn. ready to allow them repair central stations wh. wd. give them more office accommn.



H.D.	I enquired before Election.  Agreed no hope for new bldg.  Must use existg. bldgs.

	Believe Rlways cd. squeeze up – release St. Pancras hotel.

	Hotels cd. reserve more accommn for dollar tourists.

	Booking in U.S. Hotels were ready to facilitate this.  It wd. help Clubs?



H.W.	Some progress made.  Varying answers.  Only one Club has agreed to reserve hotel space – Junior Carlton.  Most others have promised special arrangemts. for honorary [or temporary] membership.



A.B.	Two inhibitions on hotels etc. – i) catering wages   ii) licensing laws.

	Can’t get Britain to go gay because of (ii).  If (ii) were reasonable, hotels themselves cd. make us go gay.



C.E.	How cd. you alter that in present Parly situation?  We went as far as we could in last Parliament.

	F/Britain Cttee want w’drawal of afternoon break.  The industry wd. oppose that.



R.S.C.	Govt. cdn’t embark on hotel industry, wd. need legn and more time than here to ’57.

	Carlton.  Only 7 year tenure: and £400.000 requd.  Hopeless.

	Ready to consider guarantee.  But cdn’t provide the money.

	Purchase tax – is under considn.



H.W.	There is one project where much of accommn cd. be available by ’51.

	Knightsbridge project.



R.S.C.	That can be handled on Investmt P’mme.



H.W.	Not ready by ’51 isn’t final answer.  Tourism is continuing dollar earner.  We have 3 or 4 propns 2 by U.S. interests, who don’t want financial guarantee, only investmt consents.



	Carlton.  Agree not economic for hotel trade.  But might pay Govt. in $ to lose £ over this.  $600.000 takings likely in 1 season.

	Might be sound propn for b/payments.



H.M.	Cdn’t N.Z. take another site?



R.R.S.	That’s v. unlikely.

	Knightsbridge.  If not yet started, can’t be finished before end ’51.

	

A.B.	Startg. new hotels in Ldn. will be v. unpopular politically qua housing.



H.M.	But apart fr. F/Britain, there is strong case for dollar earning tourists.



P.M.	Make it clear tht. this comes out of commercial allocn not out of housing allocation.



B.	In long-term, B.T.C. can make contn.  Terminal hotels are paying well.

	This is permanent p. war problem – not to be relieved by temporary expedients.  Give B.T.C. allocn under Inv. P’mme. and they will make big contn.



R.S.C.	No room for more capital investment.  Can’t set out on p’mme of hotel bldg.  The Carlton project is the most practical.  If we cd. get someone to do it.



H.M.	Cd. some new hotels be added to investmt p’mme at expense of commercial and industrial p’mme. 



A.B.  	At expense in Ldn. of office bldg.



P.M.  	Agreed.  Subject to no interference with housing, consider allocn under investmt p’mme to one or two hotels.



H.McN.	Wd. provoke similar demand from Scotland.

	Believe quickest way is to squeeze out people like 			B.T.C.



H.W.	Cd. M/W. extend his survey to hotel-use for other purposes – to go beyond Govt. Dpt. use and cover other office use.



H.M.	Conversion of 2 aircraft carriers to give more accommn.



H.W.	Need is for more luxury accommn.  Wd. this help?

	Ship in Thames wd. be v. attractive.  



H.D. 	Sewerage stops it.



		Agreed: H.W. to focus and report to H.M.



							           [Exit B. and R.R.S.

		2.	Tea Ration.



M.W.	As in memo.



R.S.C.	V. bad method of buying.  Fix the price but get no guarantee of firm delivery.  Have to pick up other peoples’ leavings.  It is really a support price.



M.W.	Return to tea-market.  Am putting in a memo. on this.

	Can’t start it w’out a stock.



R.S.C.	And this redn in ration is essential to build up stocks.



H.M.	Endorsed R.S.C.’s point with regard to method of purchase.

	Cdn’t C.R.O. make repns to H. Commrs.  – ruining tea-trade.

	Cdn’t we at Canberra raise ques. of increased tea supplies. and developmt. of tea prodn in Colonies.



A.V.A.	Short period of notice?  



M.W. 	Can’t lose another 8 week period.



H.M. &amp;	Effect on local elections.  Delay until after that, even at cost of losing

Others	another period.



M.W.	Will consider means of p’poning public announcement until after elections.



	Agreed : 	M/F. to submit on Thursday plan for doing this after 		elections with least loss of tea.



							     [Exit M.W. Enter K.Y.



		3.	Anglo-American Discussions.



E.B.	Have circd report on officials’ discns up to date.

	Can’t foresee what U.S. line may be, when Acheson arrives.

	R. has made more progress than we hoped – in propaganda, atomic energy and China.



	U.K. and U.S. views – Atlantic, M/East, F/East.

	At same time, risk of conflict betwn. economic and political aspects.

	On pol. side, I’m sure our interest lies in co-opn with U.S.  The Third Force hasn’t any force.  On defence, all practical consns point to co-opn with U.S. and Canada.



	Germany.  40 m. G. associated with west.  Formidable industrial community, wh. has lost most of agric. backg. and will have to live on exports.  Must bring G. into w. world – with minimum friction with French.  Must try to bring her in w’out encouraging rabid nationalism or spread of communism.



	But where is she to stand in fin/econ. field? R.S.C. is concerned.

	We are being criticised for hanging back in Europ. co-opn.

	Risk of Europe siding with U.S. on this.  That problem isn’t yet resolved. We must isolate sterling problem – get decln tht. sterling will be supported.  And tht. no pressure will be put on us in defence ques. wh. will undermine our economic posn.



	Form of conference. Three parts. 	i)  Anglo-American, where much can be said wh. won’t be repeated in ii) or iii).



						ii)  Anglo-Am-French.  Will review S.E.A. as well as Atlantic and Europ. ques.



						iii)  N.A.T.O. Council.  Some matters also to be discussed with U.S./Canada/U.K.



	Atomic Energy the “Know how”.  We have got nothing, since passage of Macmahon Act.  F.O. have considered afresh – and all was ready for new : satisfactory agreement when Fuchs case occurred.  Propose now to try to re-open that.



	S.E.A. and F/East.  No reason to believe U.S. have evolved a policy twds. China.  We are therefore at cross purposes.  Our recognition has helped to steady things – sure it was wise.  But can’t get decided view on future developmt. of U.S. policy; and this uncertainty is influencg. attitude of other Comm. countries.



	Japan.   No sign yet tht. U.S. are ready to consider Peace Treaty.

	Don’t see what we can do to force it – tho’ wd. be to our advantage to see early Treaty.



	Defence.  Developmt. of events has led to increased expense and will lead to more unless we can organise Atl. community.  W. Union is too weak : Europe will press us all the time to do more.  Want therefore to widen it up to Atlantic basis and all contribute acc. to capacity. China - ???? under one bloc : must be balanced by more than W. Europe.  To take it as a whole, must “have regard to economies it has to carry” (?)



	After i) and ii) above, as we enter iii), we must strive for some decln as to what we stand for, where we are going, and what we intend to do. F.O. and U.S. workg. (separately) on this.  It will be submitted to Cab. in due course.

	Germany.  France want her insulated fr. any contact with Atl. countries.  On econ ques. want her handled thro’ O.E.E.C. 



	We shall have to reconcile this.  Auriol’s statement y’day was advance. His attitude is one wh. G. ought to accept – come in and evolve as part of Europ. organism.

	If G. responds to that, France won’t be able to m’tain intransigent attitude or insistence on G.’s isolation.

	But it’s a fact tht. Italy as well as France are afraid of Germany.

	Method of handling discussions.

	Want help of Ministers mainly concerned with econ. and defence ques. in these matters as they come along.

	Conclusion.  To m’tain our liberty, we must associate with other nations of the west to ensure we aren’t attacked and to develop sound international economy.



A.B.	i)  Bottom of p. 2. of memo. C.P. 92.  Disposn of U.S. and Fr. – surely it wd. be dangerous for us to give impn we are holding back on this.



	ii)  Para. 6.  Hope it will be made clear we won’t make any concessions which wd. delay viability by ’52.  Can’t accept permanent dependence on U.S.



E.B.	U.S. are in hysteria.  France in fear.  Because of R. possession of atomic bomb.  Some Congressmen favour therefore approach to Stalin.

	My trouble : what are you going to ask for: You wd. be going in weakness, not strength.  Byrnes’ visit in ’45 was a failure and began cold war – also lost China.  My objective: secure liberty of small nations and their freedom from aggression.  They can be clearly embodied in a document.  If R. showed any willingness to call off cold war and talk, certainly I wd. negotiate.

	But useless to try to negotiate with R. from weakness.



A.B.	Agree.  But we cd. lose Election if it became known tht. U.S. and France favoured this but we wdn’t agree.

								[Exit G.A.I.



E.B.	If they made up their minds to that, I wd. have to refer to Cabinet.



A.B.	If status quo of discns as in para. 8 leaked, it wd. be embarrassing to us.

	For part of Stalin’s strength is his capacity to fake a peace move.



E.B.	I will watch this qua publicity, and leakage.



A.	Fr. weakness emphasises need to get G. into western orbit in right frame of mind. 



E.B. 	If you want them to fight, you must let them trade.

								[Exit R.S.C.



H.D.	Endorse memo. on Germany.  We must continue to distrust them: but woo them in C/Europe.  Try them out in this secondary setting.



	Main issue: Atlantic community is preferable to W. Europ.

	We must lose no opp. of going over to first rather than second.

	Support ii) of A.B. from that point of view.



H.McN.	On i) the line is, if U.S. revert to this, to say we are ready to talk on agreed Agenda includg. atomic energy.  Then U.S. will take a realistic line.

	Put Atlantic community first.  For then Fr. can take risks with Germany.

	So long as emphasis is on W. Union alone, she can’t.



P.M.	Third Force no good because no force in it.  General agreement with this view.
