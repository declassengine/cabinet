C.M. 41(50)							3rd July 1950.



		1.	Wages Policy.



R.S.C.	Tewson agrees with draft.



P.M.	Endorse.



H.M.	A word of praise for T.U.C.? 



R.S.C. 	Said it in Budget debate.



T.W.	Claim by farm workers.  Will this invite independent members to support wage increase.  Pledged at a special review of prices to recoup for sudden increase in wage costs.

	Road men have appln in.



R.S.C.	My statement will emphasise right part of T.U.C. statement.  This = most we can do at present.  After Sept. confce T.U.C. may be ready to go on talkg. about policy – machinery etc.



A.V.A.	Cd. final 2 lines make it clear it wd. re-act on workers’ conditions – bring this house to them.  



R.S.C. 	I will do this – in statement or in reply to supplementary.   



P.M. 	Add words at end – quite a few.



H.M.	At end of T.U.C. statemt. mild invitn to Unions to consult T.U.C.

	In Sweden there’s some collective arrangemt.  Cd. M/L. report on this.



G.A.I.	Several precedents – Holland, A. and N.Z. also.  Precis is being prepared.

	For L.P. Cttee or Cab.

	Last sentence designed prob. to fly kite at Congress – get their views.



R.S.C.	T.U.C. are aware of all that – don’t want to mention it until after Sept. mtg.



A.B.	Callg. off a standstill will be taken by all tribunals as invitn to go ahead.

	

	This statement doesn’t suggest we have any labour (wages) policy at all. No guidance to tribunals.  No refce to lower paid. E.g. miners claim: there is a case for lower paid.

	This seems to abandon wages guidance altogether.



R.S.C.	T.U.C. won’t agree v. lower paid because of differentials.



A.B.	Relatg. wages to economic needs.

R.S.C.	Tried that too; but T.U.C. wdn’t have it because of appearance of dictatn of Govt.



A.B.	Then we have abandoned wages as instrument to serve ends of economic planning by influencg. distn of man power.



R.S.C.	Can stress tht. W. Paper doctrine still remains – and that has element of guidance in it.



A.B.	Give away “under paid”: stick to distribn of man power.



R.S.C.	Insert words referrg. to W. Paper.  Then can quote it again to Tribunal.



A.B.	Add reference to increased earnings due to productivity. (Agreed).



R.S.C.	Means lengthening it.



A.B.	Useful qua guidance to Tribunals.



H.D.	Expounded at length in Budget speech.



A.V.A.	Wd. also weaken Ty. posn on fixed salaries.



		Draft approved: subject to these 2 amendments.

		To be announced in reply to P. Notice Ques. today.



							[Enter K.Y. and Willey

		2.	White Fish Industry.



A.	If subsidy, make it clear it only lasts until Bd. is establd.



P.M.	Essentially a short-term plan.



A.	But bring it out in any statement by P.M.



H.McN.	Para. 12 of P.C. 64.



P.M.	Can the £3½ m. be switched?



W.	Price increases elsewhere.  We shd. be giving the subsidy w’out price decrease.

	We are close to subsidy ceiling.

	Can’t say to what price addn wd. be made.



A.V.A.	Purpose of subsidy: Near and inshore only? 



T.W.  	Yes. 



A.V.A.	V. diff. to separate short and long-term.



	Retail sales are down by 40% as cpd. with ’49 – in volume.  Prices are about same as pre decontrol., for better qualities.  Coarse fish – prices to catchers have bn. raised.



	Unless condns to subsidy there will be remedy.  Waste: losses due to excessive competn at ports: will continue.



	No course save natn from trawlers up to retailer.



	Many other subsidies are related to home prodn targets – dangerous to switch away fr. them.



T.W.	Doing nothg. will leave things in same disorderly state.

	All Cttees earlier have rejected natn of trawlers, whatever else.

	A.V.’s points all relate to need for long-term re-organn wh. is admitted, and is to be done by the Bd.



H.D.	Who wd. get the £3½ m?



T.W.	Last 3 paras. of Annex B. to P.C. 64

	Offer could be limited to 6 months, subject to review.



R.S.C.	Most are shore fishermen. Get good pay for what is caught.  Owners of trawlers are losing their share because of low wholesale price.  Subsidy will enable them to carry on pro tem – whereas otherwise they wd. stop sending trawlers to sea.



A.B.	This supports my solution tht. Govt. shd. own trawlers and lease them.

	The subsidy wd. m’tain value of trawler to owners and later we shall have to compensate at that level.

	Step in now and buy the trawlers.



T.W.	Too many trawlers and over prodn is cause of trouble, or cause of low price to fishermen.



K.Y.	Doubt if it’s true tht. if nothg. is done in short-term, more ships will be laid up.  Owners are laying up in turns (normal seasonal thing) and threatening to do more: but not sure they will – it’s a bluff.

	If subsidy given, shd. be clear condns.

	Posn of Bd. wd. be strengthened if owners had bn. forced to accept public money.



E.Sh.	Convenient, ???? to offer subsidy.  But it wdn’t be temporary

	Bd. wd. have to solve same problem.  They, seeing subsidy accepted in principle, wd. urge its continuance – at least, for some years.

	Problem is one of price.  Distributg. costs are prob. too high.

	R.S.C. suggests switchg. subsidy fr. other commodities.  You will get a row about that, and no credit for what you have given to fish.

	Why not let fish prices go to economic level?  When it rises, we think we must intervene, if only by expressg. disapproval.

T.W.	They rose on de-control, but only for a day.  Now retail prices are below controlled level.



E.Sh.	And we are now asked to give subsidy.

	Against it.  Won’t do owners any good and will have to last.



P.M.	Will everyone stand firm v. subsidy.  Or will you force me to give way.



A.B.	Won’t end pol. anxieties by subsidy.  Will still be unempld and we shall have given money only to owners.



H.W.	This will prevent nos. of unempld fr. rising.  Subsidise amount of fish caught: but not expected to increase quantity merely to keep it up.

	Situation aggravated by de-control of distribn.  Are distributors getting larger margins than before de-control?  If so, case for re-imposg. min and max price control.



T.W.	Near and middle men started to lose money last Oct, before de-control, because of coarse fish fr. further out.  Posn wd. be same if distributors took no profit at all.



H.M.	What are real troubles	   a)  inevitable post-war redn in consumptn.

				   b)  increased costs of trawler bldg. &amp; 				        m’tenance.



	They made enormous profits and wages during war.

	Normal economic process wd. be for industry to re-adjust itself to current condns.  Painful but healthy.

	Appointmt of Bd. won’t solve anything.

	State-owned trawlers – wd. rent be economic or aided (= subsidy).

	Subsidy will not be temporary.



H.W.	Only argument for subsidy = buy time while you re-organise.

	Will also prevent sitn from gettg. even worse.

	But doesn’t solve any problems.



G.A.I.	How much is this unemplt. due to this trouble?  Much is seasonal.

	[Aug. ’49 dropped to 1.000 odd.  May ’49 5.130. 8.000 odd now.]

	What abt. ship-bldg.  Does that earn a case for subsidy.

	Shall we, by subsidy, reduce unemplt. pay cost?

	More politics in this than economics.  Grimsby owners are trying it on.

	C/living index on knife-edge.  Even transfer may upset it.  And one point rise wd. be awful qua wages.



H.D.	Increased consumption.  Is it as bad as M/F. memo. suggests?

	Are friers really provided with enough fat?



R.S.C.	Yes: that shortage was 1 year old.



W.	Friers aren’t taking up full allocn.  That = general posn.



H.D.	Some cd. take more.



E.Sh.	Satisfied, despite W.O. tht. Army cd. use more fish – fried, with more fat allocated.



H.D.	Increased consumptn hasn’t been sufficiently explored.



A.B.	Subsidy to keep empld those who are fishing now.  But campaign for increased prodn to put unemployed fishermen back to work.



	Two pronged attack.

	Agree subsidy will continue.

	Shd. the £3½ m. come off other food subsidies?  If meat were dearer, more fish wd. be bought.  Spread this therefore over other foods.  That will help us to fend off subsidy claim from eg. ship building or repairing.



	Ask M/F. on what other foods it cd. go and what it wd. cost.



H.D.	Use it to reduce price of fats.



W.	No: reason is tht. amount of demand for fried fish has dropped.



R.S.C.	cf. this weekend, when fish sales in Ldn. rose when only 1/= meat ration.



G.T.	Reason: fish is dearer than meat and people will only eat it fried.

	Friers are selling their “allocn ” of fat : good-will of business.



W.	Doesn’t apply now: for anyone can enter industry and get an allocn.



H.McN.	Why continue allocn?  Why not free it?



H.W.	Why not subsidise increased consumption of fish?  We do for meat.



G.T.	Support Govt. ownership of trawlers.

	Grimsby owners have got out with intent to buy back at low prices.

	And home-killed meat is cheaper than plaice at 2/= a pound.

	These small remedies won’t touch that.



H.M.	This is a diff. kind of subsidy – it’s to prop up an industry, and stave off a v. small amount of unemplt.



J.	Fallacy to say you are buying time.  Will never get rid of this subsidy.



H.McN.	Long-term diseases and remedies were in our other memo.

	L.P.’s line: let industry solve own diffies.  It has always done so by reducg. catches, increasg. prices and causg. unemplt.  Is that to be our answer to Labour M.P.’s fr. fishing ports.



	Social and defence reasons for keeping industry going.

	Industry has bn. weakening for 8 mos.  In another 4 it might adjust itself at cost of ships wanted in war.



	Political activities at Grimsby.  Half that fleet is in distant water.

	They aren’t askg. for our help.  Near and middle: mostly small men,

	sharing in ownership of one or two trawlers.

	The subsidy plan is a means of buying time.



P.M.	Thought near and middle caught better quality fish, as eaten by Tories.



E.Sh.	M/L. shd. ascertain how many of these “unempld” are really part-time fishermen only.  Always bn. trouble of this kind in trawler industry – since 1914.  Is this an unemplt. problem, really?

	Answer to P.Q.    i) promise efforts to increase consumption of fish. (I cd. do more with W.O. than M/F. did).  ii) Pendg. establmt of Bd. get the facts re unemplt.



H.D.	Case for this subsidy hasn’t bn. made.

	Add for reply iii) promise to get agreemt. to limit foreign landings.



H.McN.	Consistent with i) tht. subsidy decreases as catch grows.  



H.M. 	Poor incentive.



H.M.	Publicity – shd. be done by industry, not by Govt.



T.W.	Industry: employers ask for subsidy: men for Bd. + subsidy.



R.S.C.	Political ques. only: can you hold it?   



G.W.  	No: you will give way in weeks.



P.M.	Then I’m in favour of announcg. a tempy subsidy.



	Agreed: Offer subsidy.
