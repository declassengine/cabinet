C.M. 9(51).				26th January, 1951.



	Korea.



P.M.	Our repns have had some effect.  Para. 2 will be amended in a

		sense acceptable to us.

	Comes down therefore to sanctions.  If that were subordinate to

		further discns, that wd. meet us.  Our objn is to procdg. direct

		to sanctions w’out considerg. further negotn.

	It might be better to reverse order of U.S. final paras. – puttg. good

		offices Cttee first &amp; puttg. sanctions in terms tht. they wd. be 

		considered only if good offices fail.



C.E.	Israelis are looking a long way ahead.  Examples:  Burma etc.

	Their resoln will be read as applying to nearer sitns.



P.M.	Explanatory only – justifn for some mention of contingent sanctions

		at this stage.



A.B.	Not necessary to say it:  our membership of U.N. alone commits us

		to consider sanctions v. aggressor.



H.G.	Want if poss. to avoid breach with U.S. &amp; Comm.

	Points of diffy were 2 &amp; 8.  2 is now met.  Leaves us only with 8.

		Israel’s suggn gives us best way out of that diffy that we can 

		expect.  If it were accepted by U.S., we surely shd. vote for 

		resoln.

	I myself wd. still urge re-considn even if 8. is not amended.  We

		shd. at least abstain.  I wd. have preferred to vote for:  &amp; believe

		that wd. have bn. E.B.’s view.

	Cd. we not conclude:  in view of amendmt of 2, abstain.  If 8 amended

		as now, vote for.  In neither event, vote against.



J.	Support – voting for, if 8 is amended.



A.B.	Don’t re-open y’day’s decision.

	U.N. disregarding Peking’s elucidns:  unreal.

	Exhaust possibilities of conciliation before we go further.

	Why look fwd. to remote possibilities, as Israelis do?

	Effect on Chinese:  they will feel door is slammed.



P.M.	Don’t put Chinese case too high.  They have aggressed.  They are

		fighting.



A.B.	I have accepted para. 3.  But we are anxious to get peace.

		Not to conciliate U.S. opinion.



P.M.	Not merely U.S. opinion.



T.W.	This amendmt of para. 8 entitles me to change my mind.

		Only if Cttee fail in basic U.N. policy are they to consider 

		sanctions.



A.	Favour voting for, if Israeli amendmt accepted.



H.D.	Para. 8 was basis of my objn.  Amended 8 still contemplates sanctions.

	    |	Econ. wd. hurt us.  Mil. wd. involve us in major war with Ch. –

	 y |	wh. opinion here wdn’t tolerate.  Posn has not changed since last

	    |	night enough to warrant change of view.



H.G.	This means, no matter how intransigent Ch. are, we won’t contemplate

		sanctions.  If we take this line now, can’t expect others to support

		us if Ch. attack H. Kong &amp; we change our tune.



J.G.	Split between e. &amp; w. in Comm. is even more dangerous than split

		betwn. U.K. &amp; U.S.

	If we are driven into ec. sanctions v. China, how do we stand with

		Asiatic members of Comm.

	Why allude to sanctions at all, at this stage?



P.M.	Be realistic.  We have opposed this.  Ch. answer isn’t completely

		satisf.  Can’t throw over all our friends for fear of Asian

		attitude – don’t know yet for certain what India’s attitude will be.



A.	This Israeli plan must be more acceptable to India.



P.M.	Quite unrealistic to suppose you can get all refce to sanctions deleted.

	If we cd. get this, gt. triumph.  Don’t risk losing all by pressing for

		too much.



K.Y.	F.O. want to support Israeli amendmt.

	Good offices Cttee wd. be much better than Cttee of Peace Observn

                    x/		Group.  For that includes “China”.  Tremendous dispute as to

		which China.

			General support for x/.



C.E.	Doubtful about “in case …” clause.  But if J.’s interpn of it is right,

		resoln wd. be improved.

	What can we say to our people about our efforts to improve it?



P.M.	Surely I made that plain in my statement in H/C.  Will be inferred fr.

		that tht. our efforts got it changed.



W.S.	E.B.’s views on Mon.  In last resort we shd. support U.S. resoln – more

		esp. if it were supported by Comm. &amp; NATO. Powers.  “I can’t

		let a pal down when I’m in a fight with him.”

	Israeli plan.  We shd. be able to get support of old Doms.  We shd.

		press it v. strongly on U.S.

			Generally agreed:  as above (incldg. x/).



P.M.	But diff. to decide in advance what to do if amendmts put fwd.

	My preference wd. be to abstain in that event.



H.D.	I’m not happy at anything re sanctions.  Repeat y/.  Remains my view.



P.M.	Doesn’t commit us to sanctions.  I’ve already told Truman I won’t

		support mil. measures:  &amp; that econ. measures are futile.



A.B.	If our public think we have bn. dragged into voting for resoln we don’t

		believe in merely to keep in with U.S., we shan’t get Labour

		Party to accept our defence p’mme next week.  They will support

		that only if we preserve our independence.



P.M.	If we get this, vote for.

	If we get somethg. less, I shall have to decide wtr. to abstain or vote 	against.  And we were prs. a little hasty in decidg. y’day tht. abstentn 	was weak.



H.D.	I agree tht. Labour supporters will link this with receptn of defence 

		p’mme.
