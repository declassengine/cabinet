C.M. 1(51).				2nd January, 1951.



	1.	Commonwealth Prime Ministers Meeting.

				    [Enter  Att.G., C.O.S.

P.M.	Attendance of Liaquat.

	Nehru’s view – no discn with all, even if informal.

	In fact, some wdn’t want to join in.  St. L. confirms this.

	We can’t accept Liaquat’s dictation.  Must stand to line tht.

		we can’t guarantee mgt. of all P.M.’s.



G.W.	No final answer until Nehru seen.



P.M.	Can’t have P.M.M. used as forum for accusation by one v. another.



G.W.	Shd. Rahimtoolale represent him?



P.M.	Not when his P.M. refuses to come.  G.W. cd. see him now.



H.McN.	Offer Canada, Australia &amp; U.K.



G.W.	Nehru hasn’t accepted that in terms &amp; we can’t now ask him 

		until he arrives.



H.G.	Can’t we tell him S. Africa &amp; Ceylon don’t want to participate.

		That wd. help our position.



G.W.	I will try to draft telegram to Pakistan.





	2.	Korea.



E.B.	Can we do anything in P.M.M. to influence situation?

	U.S. may demand in U.N. tht. China be named as aggressor.

	Will have to be settled by negotn somehow.  But how?

	First group discn will now be in P.M.M.

	Aims:   i)	stabilise military situation.  Had hoped U.N. forces wd. be

			able to hold a stable line somewhere – to show aggression

			doesn’t pay.  Prospects of this now seem to be worse.

			………………………….



C.I.G.S.	Mil. sitn.  Opposing forces about equal strength ………..



H.McN.	U.S. attitude re China may be softening, since P.M.’s visit &amp; since

		finding themselves w’out friends on this in U.N.

	Make it plain to U.S. &amp; to Comm. countries tht. some delaying device

		re Formosa must be devised.  For dilemma can’t be resolved

		now.



H.G.	Endorse analysis by E.B. &amp; P.M.

	Vital to hold in Korea a) keeps U.S. quiet  b) gives some bargaing.

		power with Chinese.

	Pressure fr. U.S. likely to be on econ. sanctions v. China.  Can we

		hold our posn on this?  If we can’t, we shall lose H. Kong.

	If U.S. action provokes China to press expansionism – if Indo-China

		went, Malaya wd. be in peril.  And loss of Malaya wd. be a

		v. serious economic blow.  Can we prepare for that situation?



J.G.	H. Kong.  Key T.U.’s are controlled by Communists.  If they were 

		ordered to make trouble, they certainly cd.

	Elsewhere in East many emigrant Chinese.  Do U.S. remember this?

	Ch. K. Shek is spent force. 



		Agreed:  Endorsed policy submd. by E.B.  First seek

			      support of Comm. Govts. for it



P.M.       	M’while, keep it v. close for fear of leakage.



E.B.	Want to authorise Franks now to take Acheson into his confidence.

		Not official intimation.



J.G.	Esp. as Truman is to make a pronouncement to Congress.





	3.	Germany:  Soviet Proposal for Meeting of C.F.M.



E.B.	Soviet reply received.  V. long.  Re-iterates much tht. was in earlier

		note.

	U.S. &amp; French both wanted offls. to discuss substance as well as

		agenda.

		I had therefore to compromise on this at Brussels.

	R. have now said offls. shd. not discuss substance.

	R. don’t want officials to meet in N. York.  I favour Vienna.

		Seeking Kelly’s advice.

	Am discussing with U.S. &amp; France:  &amp; will submit draft reply.

	R. accepts mtg:  I am keen to go fwd. with it.





	4.	Japan:  Peace Treaty.



	a)	Individual Claims.



E.B.	About £1½ m. assets may be available to us.  B. claims v. it will be

		v. large.

	U.S. have gt. J. assets – and distributed them to individ. claimants.

	Doubt if we’ll get much for this.  Choice:  prob. carry cost on U.K.

		funds or say there won’t be compensn.



H.G.	Useless to provide for this in Treaty.

	We have already spent £30 m. in compensn in Malaya etc.  Let us

		take the £1½ m. in compn for that.

	Can’t accept p.o.w. claim.  Agitn not strong.  New departure.

		How refuse it to p.o.w. ill-treated in Germany.

	Repudiate liability to both – p.o.w. and property lost.



E.Sh.	Ty. have made ex gratia paymts. already.  Accepted principle.



H.G.	Not aware of that.



C.I.G.S.	Claims paid were for kit lost e.g. in retreat fr. Burma or in Singapore.

		No paymts. on basis tht. they were p.o.w.

		C.O.S. don’t want that anyway – don’t encourage people to

		become p.o.w.

			Endorse recommn in para. 9.

			Endorse principle tht. we don’t pay p.o.w. for having

			        bn. p.o.w.



			Ty., M/D., F.O. and C.O. (with B/T.) to prepare agreed

			        line of statement:  for submission to Cabinet.



	b)	General Treaty Provisions.



E.B.	Indicns now tht. U.S. may prefer a short general Treaty.



H.McN.	Para. 7(0).  Answered:  inopportune for us to suggest now tht. China

		be asked to participate.

	Surely, mistaken for us to say we wd. conclude Treaty, w’out invitg.

		to participate.  U.S. clearly wdn’t invite them even.  What do

		U.S. intend?  To go ahead, invitg. only F/E. Commn &amp; Ceylon:

		and prs. Ch. K. Shek?



E.B.	Don’t know.  U.S. attitude may be changing.

	Don’t bind Cab. to decn on that issue now.



H.McN.	India will take this point.



E.B.	We agree tht. China must be in.  Only ques. is:  who represents

		China?  And we don’t intend to say Ch. K. Shek represents 			China.



H.McN.	We must make that abundantly clear to C.P.M.’s.



 G.W.	Some trouble likely with A. &amp; N.Z. over this liberal approach.

		N.Z. wants to stop J. re-arming.

		A. wants many econ. sanctions &amp; claims included in Treaty.

	Points wh. can’t be enforced.

		a) P. 3. para. 8(viii) &amp; (x) wd not be enforceable.  Re-examine.



A.	Is para. 8(f) practicable either?



H.McN.	We must put it into the Treaty.

P.M.	U.S. will turn it down.



	c)	Security Aspects.



E.B.	MacArthur’s last announcemt. increases need to put our C.O.S.

		views to U.S.



C.I.G.S.	Our views stated in memo.  Don’t want U.K. or U.S. Forces locked

		up for ever in Japan.  She shd. be respons. for her own security.

		Isolated, she can’t be a threat.  In last war, she was because

		a) access to raw mats. in China  b) large Navy.

		This need not happen again.



E.B.	Do C.O.S. know of any change of mil. views in U.S.?



C.I.G.S.	No.



E.B.	I believe U.S. Govt. authd MacArthur to make his statement.

		I want now authority to take this up with U.S. Govt. –

		MacArthur’s statement.	Agreed.



E.Sh.	We are proposg. re-armament of G. before Peace Treaty.

	Is MacA. proposing any more than that?

	Be careful how we approach this.



H.McN.	No parallel.  Policy re G. was agreed betwn. 3 powers.



H.D.	On merits – what chance tht. J. will go Communist.  Pity to re-arm

		them if they will join the other side.



E.B.	Can’t say.



E.Sh.	Com. strength is not believed to be great.



E.B.	Wasn’t in Czecho.  This is a sound point.  And I will take it up 

		with U.S.

				[Exit  C.O.S.



	5.	International Status of Korean Conflict.



P.M.	Diff. ques.  Domestic law as well as international.



E.B.	There are 2 positions to be reconciled.



E.Sh.	Wd. Geneva Convn apply?



Att.G.	Prob. not.  But we shd. say we wd. regard ourselves as bound by it.



J.	Advantages for us both ways.

	We cd. correct domestic diffies by amendg. legn.

Att.G.	Balance of expediency in favour of treatg. it as intern. pol. action.

		Then amendmt of domestic law shd. be considered at once.

		Shd. H.M. have power to declare they are to be deemed a war.



P.M.	Also what happens on a switch into war from this?



A.B.	Amending legn wd. embarrass us even more?



			Take Note:  officials to consider effects in dom. law.





	6.	Industrial Disputes.



	a)	Town Clerks.



G.A.I.	……. Town Clerks waitg. a court decision.  If that goes v. me, they

		will be in strong posn to force me to refer to arbitn.



Att.G.	Certainly don’t refer at this stage.  If court decides Minister has no

		discretion, he will have to refer T. Clerks to Tribunal.

		If it doesn’t, he prob. needn’t.



A.B.	I couldn’t have forced l.a.’s to take difft. action.  I gave them v. strong

		advice:  couldn’t have done more.

	M/L. shd. not refer these claims anyway – for he wd. thus elevate into

		formal “negotiations” talks wh. h’to have bn. a fake.



Att.G.	M/L. has sold that pass already:  because he has referred M.O.H. and

		D. Edn cases.  If therefore court decides he has no discretion, he

		will have to refer.



P.M.	Await decision in Kemsley case.

		M’while expedite submission on Order 1305.

				                  [Exit  Att.G.

				                  [Enter  M.W.

	7.	Future of East African Groundnuts Scheme.



H.G.	Mtgs. with Coates &amp; Govr./Tanganyika.

	Recommend we go fwd. on 60.000 acres schemes.  For

		a)  If successful cd. expand to 102.000 after 2 or 3 yrs.

		b)  Abandonment wd. be little cheaper than 60.000 plan.



P.M.	Read note from L.P.

	Political advantages of abandoning it altogether.



J.G.	We went into that.  Satisfied there is a chance of success on 60.000.

	Pol. disadvantages of abandonmt. wd. be v. great.



M.W.	Queensland – must remain in M/Food.



H.D.	Cdn’t we say in Wh. Paper tht. this is a success.



H.McN.	Beware.  Let’s reserve self-praise until success in assured.



H.G.	Comments on drafting of Wh. Paper – will send them to M/F.
