C.M. 19(51).				12th March, 1951.



	1.	Durham County Council.                          [Enter  N.B., B., W.W.



H.D.	Tory Motion.  Our posn is clear, but tactics are diff.  Our supporters

		won’t vote v. Durham.  Suggest reasoned amendmt. which

		approvg. attitude adopted by Govt. hoping tht. discns will lead

		to useful result.



E.Sh.	Support this plan.  Otherwise v. awkward for Durham members –

		who wd. otherwise abstain.



J.G.	Not illegal to make such a condition.



G.T.	Original resolution – involved dismissal of existg. employees:

		I told them if it was enforced I wd. have to act.  And employees

		didn’t send in the forms.  Resoln thus became dead letter.  Now

		active again because attitude of Council in makg. new 

		appointments.  Direction ready for issue.

	Endorse H.D.’s plan.



W.W.	Sitn not same as J.G. illustration.  T.U.’s have not met Co. Council.

		Latter have taken it in own hands.  We must stand by our

		declaration.



H.M.	Public opinion will be solid against Co. Council.

	On merits I would vote for Tory motion.

	Co. Council is likely to bring Labour movemt. into disrepute.



H.D.	Stiffer amendment:  to be moved by back-benchers.  Let a few

		Ministers meet to settle terms of amendment.  C.E., H.D., A.B.,

		G.T. and W.W.                    Agreed.





	2.	Gambia Egg Scheme.



J.G.	Motion tabled.  Shd. we table reasoned amendmt?

	I am awaitg. further rept. fr. Corpn - &amp; have said so.



T.W.	But you have acted on interim report.



J.G.	Extent of modifn of scheme has yet to be recommended.



C.E.	Prefer a straight vote.



W.W.	So do I.









	3.	Deportation Powers of Colonial Governors.



J.G.	Bill under 10 min-rule by F. Brockway, on Wed., on deportn powers

		of Col. Govrs.  Recent debate on adjournment.  I’ve said all I 

		can say.  Cd. whip tell him tht., in view of this, he shd. not go 

		on with his Bill.  I can only repeat what I said in adjournment

		debate.





	4.	Reserve Forces Bill.



C.E.	Venue of prosecn – where a man shd. have reported.  Administratively

		v. awkward.  Arrest likely at his home.  Police witnesses.

	In H/L. amendmt enabling trial at place of arrest or home.



E.Sh.	I agree.	               

			                 Agreed.





	5.	Meeting of C.F.M.



H.M.	R. have sought to make G. main issue.  We are now willing to make

		a specific refce to G. re-armament.  U.S. are not.  Told Davies

		to adhere to our view, despite U.S. objns.  If it came to a break,

		we shd. have to present our case to public.



E.B.	Might be easier to refer in terms of enabling G. to preserve her 

		security.  Viz., positive approach.  Use the Italian

		phraseology.	Agreed.





	6.	N.A.T.O. Command Organisation.



P.M.	Ques. not being raised on Navy Estimates.  Must come on later, before

		Easter.

	I will issue a note, for Ministers’ informn, on case for the appointment.

				                                                      					         [Exit  W.W.

	7.	Transport:  Finance.



B.	£25 m. increase in working costs.  Need also to build up reserves &amp;

		liquidate earlier losses.

	Proposals as in memo.

	Charges scheme:  can’t be solved quickly.  Want to ask Tribunal

		to give quick 10% increase.

	Passenger charges are going to Tribunal in a week or so.  On London

		scheme Tribunal gave less than B.T.C. needed:  &amp; B.T.C. will

		ask for more for Ldn.



	Pressure from our supporters (against increased fares) for subsidy.

		F.B.I. are suggestg. subtler form of subsidy – Govt. to subsidise

		‘strategic’ rlways as defence measure.



H.G.	Must be some increase in fares &amp; rates.  How much?  Inclined to

		accept B.’s view because we are in period of increasg. costs &amp; 	they shd. have somethg. in hand.  We treat rlways toughly:  statutory

		regn of charges beyond anything applied to socialised indies.

	Methods.  Endorse 10% plan.  But L.P.T.B. plan seems a bit

		extortionate.  Another £8/9 m. from Ldn. is a good deal.



B.	Earlier scheme was mainly to adjust anomalies rather than increase

		revenue.



H.G.	On monthly returns:  keenest competn with charabancs.  Is it wise?



A.V.A.	Earlier:  they didn’t ask for this on that a/c.



B.	But now they see no other way of getting the money.



H.G.	On subsidy.  I’m against revenue subsidy.  Arguments for capital

		subsidy aren’t v. strong:  they wd. apply equally to other

		industries:  even coal argument wd.  But, even more, v. strong

		political objns.  Give impn to T.U.’s tht. we will give subsidies 

		whenever there’s a wage increase.  No cash problem:  they

		inherited £150 m.  If we ever do this, don’t do it immed. after

		a wage increase.

	Rlways still carry cost of reduced Service fares.  Ready to carry that

		on the Exchequer.

	They also get this year £3 m. fr. end of Freight Rebate scheme.



B.	There are other burdens – e.g. bridge m’tenance – wh. I wd. like to

		discuss with Ty.



H.G.	I will discuss such measures of easement – vice straight subsidy.



H.M.	Press for increased economies thro’ efficiency.



N.B.	They have discharged 54.000 staff.

	Their reguln turned on monopoly – they haven’t now got it.

	Subsidy:  some day we shall have to clear this up.  Slow pace of

		freight trains.



A.B.	What are cash reserves?



B.	Started with £150 m. at end/war.  Still v. large.



A.B.	Then, shdn’t we spend it before we increase fares?  Political 

		disadvantages of increased fares.  See what other reliefs H.G. 

		can afford.  £10 m. asked for to liquidate deficiencies of

		operations over last 3 yrs.  Need this be wiped out?

		Consider also some help on permanent way.

	I told R.E.C. they had no authority to assume tht. wage increases

		wd. carry increased fares.  Yet Elliot at once announced fares

		wd. have to be increased.



P.M.	Increase in fares will diminish traffic.  Is this the right policy?



A.	Endorse that.  Agree with A.B.  Certainly, no subsidy.



H.D.	New points raised.  Further examn needed:  esp. H.G.’s offer.  And

		m’while no increased charges.



H.G.	£5 m. at most.  And charges will have to rise.  Can’t go on 

		indefinitely running at a loss.  Last time, 3 mos’ delay in 

		decidg.  And deficit corresp. larger.  A lot of heavy traffic 

		can’t be diverted.  Costs rising – even road transport costs are.

	Increased petrol last year didn’t please M/T.



B.	It put £6 m. on our costs.



H.G.	Then road/rail competn is w’in power of M/T.



A.B.	Ready to accept increase in freights (para. 7).  And that shd. suffice,

		while we review fares ques.



H.M.	Somethg. v. yielding to B.T.C. full wage increase plus a little more.

	Put them up against it.



H.W.	Support A.B.’s idea.  But continuing erosion of earning-power of

		rlways.  Increasing creaming-off of more lucrative traffics.

	We shd. have M/T. proposals on ques. of loss of traffic to roads, 

		esp. C. licences.



B.	A year ago, all these arguments were raised:  &amp; Cab. asked for a 

		review.

		They had it – H.G. &amp; I reported.

	Anyhow we can’t stop B.T.C. from takg. their case to Tribunal.

	Fares:  only £3 m. on monthly returns.  And Tribunal may reject

		them.



H.McN.	Support H.W.  True we had a review.  But many of us were not

		convinced.  And it looks now as tho’ our then fears re loss of

		traffic were realised.  We ought to know what happened in 

		volume of traffic because 16⅔% increase.



E.Sh.	Support H.W.  Make some departure from capitalist economics.

	We encouraged wage increase because we feared strike.  We must

	therefore accept consequence of raising fares or re-examining whole 

		problem.  I am unwilling to agree even to freight increases

		w’out further report.

	Moreover, Londoners shd. not have to pay the economic fares:

		because we made the place so large.



E.B.	This has bn. developing for 30 yrs., because rationalisn of industry

		&amp; change of location.  Rlways depended on long haul:  &amp; that

		is disappearing.

	Must in the end look at road/rail on integrated basis.  In London,

		buses contributed £3 m. p.a. to tubes:  wd. never have had

		tubes w’out that contn.

	Shall never solve this problem by reference to Tribunal.

	Can B.T.C. or M/T. look far enough ahead on change of transport

		pattern.

	No quick or simple answer.  Need for clear thinking – to advise

		B.T.C.



			{  Approve Para 10(a).

	Agreed.	{  Reserve remainder pending further review.

			{  Invite M/T. to discuss fares ques. with B.T.C. in light

			      of Cabinet’s discussion.

			    Ty. to consider “reliefs”.

				[Exit  B. &amp; N.B.

				[Enter  Att.G. &amp; W.W.



	8.	Council of Europe.



H.D.	This body must remain consultative.  Para. 5.

	Important mtg:  chance to get sense into people.

	Endorse para. 17.  We can avert worst because solid group on whom

		we can rely.  Shd. work on Sforza &amp; Schumann.

	Defence:  v. diff.  Must get understandg. with “+”.

		So long as clear it’s consultative, we cd. make some concessions

		re defence discn.



B.	V. dangerous to allow defence to be discussed.  Can’t trust Sforza on

		that.  We shd. have to w’draw if they discussed defence – public

		discn ranging over N.A.T.O. field.



H.W.	Econ. affairs also in danger.  Swedes were nibbling at merger of

		O.E.E.C. in C/Europe.



H.G.	Para. 28.  3(c) is in brackets, presumably because not agreed.  We must

		stand firm on that.



H.McN.	Our repve must now say tht. we shall be forced out of the organn

		if para. 5 isn’t held.  Time now to dig in our toes.



Att.G.	Para. 13 – shall we get ⅔rds if France &amp; Italy vote with us?



H.D.	Yes:  for “clients” will vote with principals.



E.Sh.	We must take firm line on consultative function.

	Can’t allow C/Europe to discuss defence in any form.



			Agreed   {  as in memo.

			               {  Doms. to be informed.





	9.	Divorce Reform.



Att.G.	I spoke in debate against a divn.  Promoters &amp; amenders had agreed

		with me in advance.  It went to a vote, in unfortunate 

		circumstances.  Said, we shd. have to re-consider.



P.M.	We didn’t put R. Commn conditionally on no vote on Bill.  We must

		go on.



J.	And there must be enquiry into Scotland as well as E. &amp; W.



			Agreed:   Confirm (this week) tht. there will be R. Commn.

			                S. of S. Scotland to consider wtr. Scotland shd.

			                       be separate Commn.

			           *   P.M. to answer P.Q.’s.		[Exit  W.W.





	10.	Salaries of Town Clerks.



A.B.	As in memo.

	We are bound to refer to arbitn.  But individual l.a.’s can deny they are

		bound by assocn decision.



J.	You cd. let mandamus be argued.



E.B.	Moral issue:  Govt. shdn’t refuse arbitration, or appear to be doing so.



H.M.	But wrong in principle tht. 1305 shd. apply to Town Clerks:  or that

		all Clerks shd. be paid the same.  Many Labour l.a.’s will be

		annoyed if we voluntarily allow this to go to arbitn.

		Better be “mandamus – cd.”



A.B.	I don’t want to be left with a discretion.

	All we have to consider therefore is wtr. T. Clerks come under 1305.

		I’m *advised they do.  I can’t therefore avoid referring to arbitn.

	There are other remedies l.a.’s can apply individually.



J.	* “almost certainly.”



Att.G.	I can’t argue in this case there is a discretion.



			Memo. – approved.		[Exit  Att.G.



	11.	Pacific Defence.



G.W.	Austral. Govt. are v. annoyed with us.  Delay resented.  Further

		repns made.  We are thght to be trying to frustrate a thing

		they want, they believe is in their interests &amp; ours, and a thing

		we have h’to encouraged them to get.

	Annex A. is v. dangerous.

	Proper to allow A. &amp; N.Z. to look after Comm. interest in Pacific.

		Also to our interest (C.O.S.).

	Annex B., however, raises 2 points we can make.  i) Philippines and

		ii) public outcry in U.K.

	If we delay longer, or send Annex A., A. will go ahead in anger &amp;

		will drag a (reluctant) N.Z. with her.



E.Sh.	What is meaning of [  ] on p. 11.?



G.W.	That traditional Comm. obligns won’t be affected.



*P.M.	Omit [  ].



E.Sh.	G.W. case based largely on M/E.  Tel. 179 to A. and N.Z. refers to

		commitment by A. &amp; N.Z. in M/E.  There is no commitment.

	*Add words indicatg. tht. U.K. has “vital interest” in the area.

	V. gt. political risks, otherwise.

	Effect on Pakistan.  We want them in M/E.  If they think this Pact

		doesn’t admit their interests…….

	Therefore press for *.



E.B.	Won’t oppose this Pact.  I wd. have thought U.K. shd. underwrite it,

		to avoid pol. diffies but won’t press the point.



J.G.	Addn of Philippines wd. high-light our exclusion.	[Exit  P.M.



H.M.	Support Annex B.  Refer back to Cab. if Philippines can’t 

			       be excluded.
