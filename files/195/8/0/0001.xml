C.M. 27(50)							1st May 1950



		1.	London Dock Strike.			           [Enter B., and H.G.



G.A.I.	Men have returned to work.  All docks operatg.

	Trouble: Shaw Savile dispute. Hope another outbreak can be avoided.

	Believe agreemt. can be reached on the firm’s scheme.



C.E.	Never get clean settlement in dock strikes.

	Official Cttee recommendns read out.  Importance of getting this ques. referred to Minister of Labour.  Risk of “lock out”.

	i)   Shd repns be made to Shaw Savile.

	ii)  Troops shd. be held available at current level.

	iii)  Statement tht. troops aren’t retained as instrument to force 	agreemt. with Shaw Savile.



G.A.I.	Gould has seen Shaw Savile since. They will take legal course, one way or another, to avoid further trouble.  Firm and stevedores union likely to be brght. together today.

	Accept ii) above.  Expect troops can be sent away tomorrow.

	Reject iii). (Agreed).



C.E.	Another Shaw Savile ship is in trouble this a.m.  For dockers allocated to it were found not to have their books.



A.B.	We must not use troops to enforce Shaw Savile scheme.



G.A.I.	We shan’t : Shaw Savile have promised to handle this thro’ constitl. procedure.



H.D.	Enquiry into docks. Hope it’s wide enough to cover all possible causes for trouble in docks.



G.A.I.	We need full enquiry. 



B. 	I shd. be associated with it.



P.M.	I will consider with Ministers concerned, how best to press enquiries into this.





		2.	Transport. London Passenger Transport Charges Scheme.



B.	My experience has convinced me that S.I.M. Cttee were right in excludg. me from fixing of charges – even laying down principles.  I shd. not put views to Tribunal on behalf of other Dpts. – and seem to be spkg. contrary to my own Tr. Commn.

	Para (3) shows tht. plenty of people will be puttg. workmen’s fares and school-children’s fares to the Tribunal.



R.S.C.	In earlier days – Rlway Rates Tribunal – M/T. were there to advise or help and gave advice: tho’ avoiding any attitude re particular fares. Service fares were fixed by contract, not by fares.

	Service Dpts. shd. not therefore be represented.  Arrange as before by special contract.

	Official of M/T. shd. attend as amicus curias.  Nothing more.



J.	Agree.  Official shd. not behave as advocate.



H.M.	Accept memo.

	Why does scheme yield net increase of revenue of £3 m.?



B.	Budget will cost them £1½ m.  Shows wisdom of having a margin.



P.M.	Now and hereafter Tribunal’s decision will be final.  W’out Ministerial decn.  Will be Parly trouble some day.  In constituting Tribunal, as vacancies arise, M/T. shd. keep consumer interest in mind.  And shd. M/T. advise Chairman to see tht. critics get a full hearing?                              								  (Agreed.)

A.B.	Putting this out of Govt’s. power : organising Govt.’s defeat.

	We nationalise rlways: then raise freight rates: then allow workmen’s fares to be abolished.



R.S.C.	Doesn’t follow tht. Tribunal will agree to their abolition.



A.B.	But, if they do, no-one will relieve us of responsibility.

	And M/T. says tht. it’s inexpedient even to make repns to Tribunal.

	What redress has Ldn. worker?



P.M.	What alternative?  Do you want fares determined by H/Commons?

	Most unwise.



E.Sh.	I agree.  But para. 6 of Appendix: revenue increase of £3 m. Those who benefit fr. redns won’t complain : only those who suffer fr. increases.  And who will be blamed?  M/T. surely.  He cd. at least object to this budgeting for surplus.

	This is a serious political issue.  Supporters concerned v. rising costs, generally.



J.G.	Workmen’s fares : p 4. One change – relatg. to shift working – is specially objectionable.  Genl. movemt. twds. shift working: eg Morgan plant.



B.	This discn shows how diff. our posn wd. be if we had assumed responsibility for these ques.  No workmen’s fares on buses in Ldn. Moreover, many fewer people now go to work early enough to get cheap fares.  And earn more money than clericals, who come to work even later.



R.S.C.	If we have a view on workmen’s fares, our proper course wd. be to legislate requiring a rate for workmen’s fares.



H.M.	Anomalies of workmen’s fares.  Also prs. out of date – humiliating to workmen.

	The argument of M/H. = natd indies shd. all be on G.P.O. model.



R.S.C.	? Let Commn know Govt. will watch workmen’s’ fares and if 

                    x/	necessary wd. introduce legisn on it.  Then Commn might w’draw this proposal.



H.M.	Blank w’drawal wd. upset whole scheme.



H.D.	Don’t assume Tribunal won’t force concessions on basis of repns.

	The hint suggd by R.S.C. might be put rather tentatively.



A.B.	Support x/.



P.M.	Workmen’s fares are archaic survival.  Needs overhaul.



	Agreed :  Approve proposals in memo.

			x/. may be done privately and discreetly.



							              [Exit H.G. and B.

		3.	The Church and the Education Act, 1944.



G.T.	Churches’ complaint is tht. they are being asked to commit themselves to unascertainable sums at unknown future dates.

	If under s.73. they complete our form they are giving blank cheque.

	I propose a sliding scale – firmer assurances if early repairs requd.

	Proof of ability to pay 100% of their contn – for immedte bldg. cases.

	For 10 yrs. ahead 50%. Beyond that 25%.

	Satisfied tht. this is intra vires and reasonable.

	Otherwise, prepd to offer amendment. 



P.M. 	You can’t on Supply Day.



H.M.	You can say you are prepd to consider possibility.



R.S.C.	If this is to be put fwd. in H/C. it shd. be agreed first with Opposn.

	Otherwise, it will be taken as 1st bid in an auction.



E.Sh.	Opposn back benchers will bid for publicity in R.C. Press.  Our people shd. be advised to rebut those bids.



A.B.	Avoid appearg. to make concessions to pressure from R.A.B.



H.M.	Prs. announce in reply to P.Q. before the debate.  Esp. if it were decent to give it to Labour Member.

 

G.T. 	There is one down for Thursday.

 

R.S.C. 	And include statement tht. you wd. be ready to legislate if need be. (For you can’t talk about that in the subsequent debate.)



P.M.  	Let us consider draft answer on Thursday.





		1.	London Dock Strike (contd.)



G.A.I.	Shaw Savile have basis for discn this p.m. with Stevedores Union.

	Their plan : work Waipawa with Stevedore’s gang and 2 others with dockers.

	Failg. agreemt. this p.m., firm will follow procedure.

	v. satisfactory.





		4.	I.L.O. Conference, 1949.



G.A.I.	Convention No. 94.	Ratify.	Agreed.

	Resolution No. 84.	As in memo – i.e. with reservation. Agreed.

	Convention No.98.	We endorsed for G.B. only because N. Ireland 			cdn’t ratify. Art. 4. v. important to us.  Terms so 			drawn tht. it blesses neither splinter unions nor 			closed shop.  Agreed.



	Vocational Guidance. “as far as practicable” suffices to cover our position.  Agreed.



T.W.	How many other countries ratify these?



H.M.	Cab. might be told next time.



T.W.	Fish Convention – several countries won’t ratify and others won’t enforce until all have ratified.



		Memo. approved.

		M/L. to submit memo. on extent of ratifn of I.L.O. resolns.
