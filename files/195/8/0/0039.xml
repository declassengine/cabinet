C.M. 69(50)							             30th October 1950



		1.	N.A.T.O. French Proposal for European Army.

									         [Enter W.W.

									

E.B.	V. Zeeland came to see me (Chairman of N.A.T.O.).  Discussed Fr. resoln and sitn caused by it.  Puts Benelux in diffies.  Was design to force them into acceptg. Schuman Plan and Eur. Army as condn of going on with N.A.T.O. 



	V.Z. saw Schuman, who said not intended delay integrated Force.

	Suggested mtg. of F. Ministers after Def. Ministers mtg.  Cdn’t see purpose.  After consultg. P.M., said wdn’t commit myself to a mtg.  Wd. dramatise sitn and depress status of Def. Ministers.  They cd. discuss techn. aspects w’out prejudice to policy.  Consider next step when we see results of Def. Ministers mtg. Acheson has since agreed with my view.



	Later telegram suggests new twist.

	As I see it now, however, Fr. don’t want to stop integrated Force, includg. Germany.  But at same time want go on with Europ. Army (100.000) subordinate to main Force.  Looks like a mere shop-window force.



                  x	Have asked F.O. to convene internl Cttee to ensure prodn in G. doesn’t have bias twds. things wh. cd. have competitive commercial advantage later – eg. thro’ our excludg. heavy prodn from G.

	We cd. give G. a free run in trade and commerce.  Diff. balance to hold.



H.G.	Agree on last point.  Important tht. arms shd. be produced in G.

	Wd. rather they produced some than none at all.

	How is Def. Min. mtg. going?



E.B.	Genl. desire to go on with Med. Term Plan.



A.B.	When do we know fin. commitment of Plan?



E.B.	When contns worked out.  M’while we aren’t committed.

	On Eur. Army – M/D. instructed to stick to N.A.T.O. conceptns and not get drawn into discn of Europ. Army.  He is doing so.



P.M.	Fr. plan is nonsense.  If they want to do this sort of thing on their own, let them.  But we mustn’t be drawn into it.

	Prob. only a Fr. political manoeuvre.



H.McN.	Prob. also a manoeuvre to get a French Deputy Commander.

		E.B. will put in memo. as soon as M/D. gets a bit further.



A.V.A.	Empire Parly Conf. in N.Z.  Shall have to give a paper on 30 Nov.  And later a confce in Canberra, incldg. U.S. repves.  May I be kept up to date for this purpose?  



E.B. 	Yes.  Incldg. Dom. readiness to help in M/East.   



A.V.A.  	Also sterling area’s dollar expenditure.



G.W.	Diffy. of planning global war thro’ N.A.T.O.  Danger of excludg. Doms.  Must be watched v. carefully.



E.B.	That’s why we sold the “Spender Plan” to Australia.



A.V.A.	Spender pitches pretty high his claim to teach us our business.



G.W.	He talks a lot.  But Menzies doesn’t pay much attentn to him.





		2.	Korea.



E.B.	I am presenting a factual White Paper.

	Hope Cab. will agree to it’s going in soon.



H.M.	Before debate on Address.  If no policy in it, we don’t.





		3.	Egypt.



A.B.	Can Cab. have memo. on Egypt – with sp. refce to Suez Canal and Haifa.  Is tri-partite control of Canal dependent on riparian Power’s rights to stop ships?



E.B.	Yes. But on powers, there is diffce betwn. lawyers.



P.M.	Statement by Att.G. shd. go with it.



H.McN.	Sudan shd. be covered too?   



E.B.  	Yes.





		4.	Parliament: Private Members’ Time.



H.M.	Must have some.  Para. 2(1) gives them too much. Sel. Cttee compromise is better.  Parly Party agreeable to Sel. Cttee plan 

	20 Fridays.

	Allow Priv. Members to introduce Bill, but not 10 min. rule.  Propose to resist latter.



P.M.	You haven’t got your earlier argument of a mass of Govt. legn.

	Diff. to oppose 10 min. rule.  Why not offer them one day a week for that, as in olden days.



A.B.	Are we going to have standing Cttees?  If not, no harm in giving Fridays for P. Members’ Bills – they won’t get thro’.



W.W.	Must have some Cttees and let some P.M. Bills go to a Cttee.



C.E.	Bound to concede this.  



H.McN.  	I agree.



		Memo. approved.   Ten Minute Rule: first oppose it:

		then suggest one day: then Friday.





		5.	Economic Planning Bill.		[Enter G.S. and Att.Genl.



A.B.	Cab. thght powers in Bill were too negative. L.P. Cttee put in a preamble.  My Sub. Cttee then went into positive side.

	Found tht. apart fr. M/S. Dpts. have prerogative powers to carry on prodn etc.



Att.G.	No power to spend money w’out statutory authority - so you would need legislation anyway.



A.B.	I agree – ques. policy as well as law.

	Suggest widest possible powers, removg. at same time limitns on M/Supply.



	Was not part of our t. of r. to consider how such powers wd. be used. But before debate, we ought to be in a posn to say.  We don’t want this to be a frightening Bill, but a re-assuring one. 

	I contemplate a code indicatg. classes of case in wh. Govt. wd. enter into competn with private industry.



H.W.	We haven’t the powers to implement our Election manifesto.

	The point re prerogative is strongly held by M/F., who rely on it.

	But Sub. Cttee  agreed tht. powers shd. be statutory.



P.M.	Needs much more working out.  What are occasions for exercise of such powers.

	Needn’t go into details on debate on Address.

	All we need do now is remit Bill back to Sub. Cttee.



H.G.	This may cause Election.  Must be sure we have a good case.

	Sitn is more likely now to be inflationary – makes it easier to put case for negative controls.  Price control., eg. is popular.

	Big attack on “powers of Execution”.

	Mistake to include direction of labour in this Bill.

	Stimuln of emplt. in depression – not a matter for new powers wh. cd. go in this Bill. Mainly Finance Bill provns.

	But some positive things cd. go in. Fin. guarantees etc. to public boards and l.a.’s to spend or even plan for countering depression.

	In private sector, can prs. do somethg.

	Powers to manufacture and buy – care over this.  Not a strong case for makg. consumer goods to combat depression.  Case in dev. areas: but that’s different.  Buying consumer goods: what wd. we do with them when bought?



H.D.	Consider by all means.  But sympathetically.



J.	This Bill won’t go thro’ H/L.  Therefore make the Bill as attractive to as wide an audience as possible.



P.M.	The M/H. sub. Cttee shd. include some repves of

			{H/L.

			{ I will consider what wd. be most suitable body.



A.B.	Can Ty. consider wthr. positive assurance can be given re powers of Finance Corpn for small businesses – I.C.F.C.





		6.	Leasehold Reform: Offices.		[Exit G.S. Enter Ld. Adv.



H.M.	As in memo.



J.	Problem was how to define “offices”.  E.g. do you want to protect a doctors’ surgery: drawing offices: welfare offices etc.  V. diff. to draw the line anywhere.  Then anomaly by comparison with houses, when only v. long leases are to be protected.



H.M.	Also gt. pressure in H/C. to produce our Bill quickly.  Extension to offices wd. delay both introdn and passage of Bill.



A.B.	Agree tht. diffies of definition are insuperable.



H.W.	Agree.  But on detail we aren’t follow Sc. precedent: for that, by accident, covers wholesale businesses as well as shops.  Even so, B/T. don’t ask tht. English Bill shd. cover offices.



C.E.	Disappointed.  Tories will get credit for proposing extension to offices to the benefit of small professional men.  Awkward for us to appear to be resisting this.  Will deprive Bill of much of its political value.



Wh.	On our Shops Bill, Chair ruled out amendmts. extendg. it to offices.



H.McN.	Even as Tories will make the most of this limitation.

	The 2 Labour members on our Cttee put in minority report advocatg. its extension to offices.

P.M.	Yet in Scotland you accepted the majority view.



A.	Support C.E.  How will you justify not covering offices.



T.W.	Temporary measure: get on with it, quick and simple.



J.G.	Do we intend to cover offices in permanent Bill?  Can we say so?



G.T.	I wd. say so.  And commit Tories to deal with it, too.



J.G.	If you can get a definition for permanent Bill, surely you can for a temporary Bill.



H.M.	But no time – if you want tempy protn quickly.



		Agreed: don’t extend to offices.





		7.	Printers’ Strike.



Att.G.	Believe strike is now settled.  I wdn’t therefore prosecute.

	Have recd lr. fr. men complaing. tht. I haven’t prosecuted employers.

	Shd. like to say tht. chronologically their’s was first offence.

	But M/L. have said their initial action was not an offence.



G.A.I.	i)  Hope strike will be settled.

	ii)  My view is tht. a go slow or work to rule is not infringement of     	Order 1305.  Impracticable, in any event, to apply Order to a 	refusal to work overtime.



	In this case, however, restrictive practices went so far as to make life imposs. for employers.  And I don’t think their action was a lock-out – tho’ Att.Genl. does.



Att.G.	Counsel have advised tht. this is a strike w’in meaning of Order.

	Concerted action to make employer unable to carry on his work is tantamount to strike.  Ban on overtime wdn’t amount to that.



J.G.	As a matter of social policy, may be awkward tht. go slow be considered a strike.



P.M.	Moral:  Depts. shd. consult L.O.’s more than they have bn. in habit of doing.

	In this case, no prosecution – against workers or employers.
