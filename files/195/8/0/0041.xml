C.M. 71(50)							           6th November 1950



		1.	Housing. Debate in H/Commons.		        [Enter Att. G.



A.B.	Sub. Cttee on efficiency of bldg. industry. Pp. by M/Works: no conclusion.

	But mistake to suggest in debate today tht. 200,000 figure is sacred.

	Want to say tht. if productivity increases we will see wthr. it can be put up higher.



P.M.	Say we aren’t going to raise false hopes.  200.000 is right now.  But if circs. changed we might do better.  Not unalterable.



H.McN.	M/W. has mentioned 15% improvemt. in bldg. and 230.000 houses in consequence.  By programming and incentives.



A.B.	All I want is a little flexibility – mentiong. changes in internatl circs. as well as domestic.



H.G.	Decision was to fix p’mme at 200.000 for 3 yrs. even at expense of other p’mmes, in order to secure some stability in housing p’mme.

	That alone requires 3% increase of efficiency in bldg.

	We have superimposed another 3% in defence work.  Means now a 6% increase in productivity.

	Materials shortages also.

	Don’t therefore go beyond P.M.’s formula.  Not 200.000 “for all time”.



		Agreed: formula to be settled by P.M. A.B. and H.G.





		2.	Germany: Soviet Proposal for Four Power Meeting.



E.B.	Soviet invitn received Friday.  Considered line of reply.  Approached France and U.S. – with a view to delaying reply.  Concluded: unwise to reject offer to discuss.



	Have bn. watchg. for change in Soviet tactics, by wh. role of aggressor wd. be transferred to China and Soviet posed as peace-maker.

	Believe that is part of the game.

	France and U.S. have bn. thinkg. on similar lines.

	U.S. want to be stiff: don’t like my flexible line.  W’ton 3001 &amp; 2.

	Main diffce: U.S. unwilling to talk save on proof of good behaviour whereas E.B.’s only condn was a firm agenda.  On mtg. of deputies suggn U.S. fear tht. unless secret it wd. commit us to C.F.M. mtg. W’ton tel. 3002 gave text of U.S. draft reply.

	No reaction yet from France.

	U.S. approach in 3002 won’t get us anywhere.  Doesn’t call R. bluff.

	Merely evades – in masses of words.

	Read F.O. telegram. 4899.  Stress danger of mtg. with Prague decln “comme base”.  Hence need for clear Agenda.  Stress also final para.

	U.S. suggest our plan wd. lead to delay.  Their’s wd. lead to nothing.

	We cd. use mtg. to bring out no. of issues on wh. R. responsible for delaying settlements eg. Austria, Rumania etc.  Don’t want settlements for sake of settlement: and U.S. seem to.  Want to take a stand and be seen to be doing so.

	Ask Cab. to endorse 4899 policy: and let me urge U.S. towards it.



P.M.	U.S. reply most unwise.  Plays into R. hands.  Endorse E.B.’s views.



H.McN.	Say also to U.S. they aren’t taking suff. a/c of French views.  It wd. be a victory for R. propaganda in France.  U.S. aren’t patient enough with France – as over G. re-armament.



A.B.	Endorse E.B.’s view.



			Agreed: support for E.B.





		3.	Korea: Chinese Intervention.



E.B.	Have feared this all thro’ (?).  Argued with U.S. tht. we were leavg. China force (by not admittg. to U.N.) to take over R.’s aggressive role whenever it suited R.  But much prejudice from Austr. Govt. and a little from N.Z. against admn of China to U.N.



	Now China, outside U.N., is free to play role suggd by R.  I was also v. much concerned at going far beyond 38th parallel.  Didn’t want to go right to Manchurian frontier.  Wd. have preferred to invent a new strategic line.  I didn’t prevail over MacArthur’s over-confidence. Haven’t learned what passed betwn. him and Truman.



	China have bn. contemptuous of Nehru.  R. prob. believes Asia will split anyway and I/Pak will side with West: they have therefore taken chance on using China now.  Alleged Sino – Sov. Treaty: supposed to be based on Ch. man-power and R. Prodn for a war in F/East.

	Our attitude now?  I must wait a little longer.  U.S. not v. nervous pro-tem.  Will keep Cab. informed.



E.B.	Don’t like tone of MacArthur’s statement.  Political.  Provocative.



P.M.	He will want to bomb Chinese targets.  May precipitate a war.



E.B.	Have warned U.S. about that.



H.D.	Danger of increased commitments in F/East.



H.McN.	Can’t dissociate communiqué fr. tomorrow’s elections in U.S. State Dpt. will prob. recover control after tomorrow.

	Hydro-electric installns.  We shd. try to meet Ch. over that.



E.B.	Tel. 3006 W’ton. Resoln in U.N.

		Defer: another Cabinet to discuss if need be.



	Tibet.



G.W.	Is this coming up to U.N.?



E.B.	Seeing H. Commr. India today.  I have no informn.  Hope India may give me some.

	Leavg. it as far as poss. to India.





		4.	Korea: Communist Propaganda.			[Enter J.S.



Att.G.	Don’t want to prosecute.  But Cab. shd. know because may be a row over this.  Thurtle’s Ques.  Treason: too big a hammer.  If Korea is to go on, prs. we shd. introduce the Overseas Operns Bill.



J.	Sedition? 



Att.G. 	Don’t think so.  Discussed with D. and P.P.  On any charge other than treason, issues of truth might arise.



P.M.	Sabotage at R.E.M.E. Aldershot?



J.S.	Rpt. due by noon today.  Fair no. of incidents, tho’ investigns on each occasion discount sabotage.



P.M.	Comms. in R.E.M.E. etc.  	



J.S.  	Yes: because engineers run to Communism.



T.W.	Cd. Att.G. say other legn is under considn?



Att.G.	I shd. like to say so – in reply to Bromley Davenport.  /y.

	This sort of thing wd. have bn. covered in our Bill.



P.M.	Case for re-considering introdn of that Bill.



A.B.	Other considns too.  i) dismissal of Tom Hopkinson for wishing to publish photos of atrocities in Korea.  Only diffce betwn. this pamphlet and reputable newspp. = intention behind it.

	Courts are of doubtful value in this.  Guile is better.



P.M.	I’m more concerned with sabotage than propaganda.  A clear sabotage case wd. rally public support.



T.W.		This propaganda (end of pamphlet) used in big mtg. at Darlington with 	Moffat speaking.  Had a dangerous effect.  Wd. like to see powers for 	handling it.

P.M.		ii) Consider legn again before 20/11.}

		i)  No prosecn for treason.	           }  Agreed.



J.G.	Concern re atrocity stories among Labour supporters.

	Early statement by E.B. or P.M. wd. be helpful.



E.B.	Must get the facts.  Might be true.

	E.D. has made a useful statement already.

	On legisn: shd. it apply unless H.M. Govt. have formally supported U.N. action?



Att.G.	That is made clear in our Bill.



E.B.	Must preserve our sovereignty.  Can’t get collective body i/c our L.O.’s.



Att. G.	iii) May I be authorised to tell Bromley Davenport as at y/.



H.M.	Don’t commit us.  Cab. have swithered re Bill.  Can’t Att.G. say it is treason, but not worth proceeding.

							               [Exit Att.G., J.S.



		5.	Anglo-Yemeni Discussions.



		Memo. approved.





		6.	Coal.

								                       [Enter N.B.

H.G.		Described various memoranda circulated.

		Suggest genl. discussion this am.  Followed by detailed considn by offl. 	committee under Plowden.



P.M.		Discuss short term posn first. Yorkshire winders?



N.B.	Scottish men have gone back.  No other strike in sight.  Save notice by winders.



H.McN.	My guess re Lanarkshire was wrong.  That strike threat has collapsed.



	Exports.



E.B.	Better not to make promises than to make and break them.

	Don’t break contracts for 50.000 tons of coal.



N.B.	We were pressed (by Ty.) to put export target too high.

	We aren’t only people to be cuttg. coal exports.  Germany and Belgium have done.  Poland will.  Holland may.



E.B.	W. Europe’s re-armament needs will have to be met fr. Poland – who will let them down in due course.  Mistake to drive W. Europe into relying on such broken reed.



N.B.	V. doubtful if Poland can supply. They and Germany have increased internal consumptn wh. is eating into their exports.



H.W.	We are exportg. our coal in finished goods – a better thing in long run.  We can’t hope to be big coal exporters again because of man-power and increased inland consumptn.

	We aren’t first to fall down on export promises.  Look at our own diffies in getting our imports fr. others.  Don’t therefore be too apologetic.

	Try to get coal off bi-lateral basis – allocation thro’ O.E.E.C. as scarce commodity.



H.G.	Have proposed to hand it in O.E.E.C. – if E.C.E. aren’t going to do it.



N.B.	Case for continuing this in E.C.E. is that it includes Poland.



H.W.	Greater risk is fuel crisis at home this winter.



E.B.	Cd. we avoid cutting exports to Scandinavia?



H.G.	M/F. and P. thinks he can avoid export licensing.  Shdn’t be v. gt. diffies.



H.M.	Daren’t risk crisis at home.  No harm in ratting on our obligns to Argentine and Eire.



H.D.	Total 17 m.  Cdn’t it be re-distributed in favour of Scandinavia.



N.B.	C.P. 256 p.1.  Believe we can handle this w’out breakg. agreements esp. with Scandinavia.



		Agreed:	Endorse Prodn Cttee’s decision [subject to

				letting Scandinavia down as lightly as poss. –

				bearing in mind tht. more oil can be burned 

				in Argentine.]



				[     ]  was not v. firm decision.



	Import of Coal.



N.B.	Prodn has turned down again.  If this trend continues, danger of winter fuel crisis will be greater.

	Hence proposals in un-numbered memo. of 6/11.

	Imports.  Unless we buy now, we shan’t get it.  N.C.B. expect they can get ½ - ¾ m. tons, mainly in U.S. at cost of 6-8 m. dollars.

	Extreme secrecy because of price.

	Wd. sell here at current price – at loss of £1½ m.



H.W.	Political disaster to import coal.  Prodn Cttee shd. consider other possibilities first.  E.g. double-bunkering, Service Dpt. stocks etc.



H.G.	Agree.  Consider it urgently – thro’ Plowden’s Cttee.  And let report be made to Cab. on Thursday.

	Cttee must, as 1st job, consider this and lay plans for the winter.



A.B.	Progressive decline in European output of coal.  Reason: men won’t get down mines unless they have to.  Let’s have a report from C.O. on coal developmt. in Africa, where socialist revoln has not yet dawned.



P.M.	Can’t face imports from U.S., while we continue to export to Canada and Argentine.



J.G.	Better increase double-bunkering.



C.E.	Is there pol. influence in mining wh. keeps us always just a bit short? Are the Communists not to blame?



T.W.	They aren’t the only influence at work.  Suffering now for pre-war sufferings of mining community.



P.M.	No imports.  Go ahead with other measures.

	Useful to have official Committee, as proposed.



H.W.	Let African suggn be considered too.



J.G.	C.O. and C.R.O. cd. submit memo. on that – not limited to Africa.



H.G.	{Offl. Cttee	a) This winter.  Quick rept. for Ministers.

	{		    if decns needed.

			b) Next year.

			c) Long term.
