C.M. 54(50)							              16th August 1950



		1.	Birth of Princess.			[Enter H., A.H., H.G., J.S.



	Message to their Majesties – congratulations.	Agreed.





		2.	Recall of Parliament.



P.M.	W.S.C. is pressing for earlier recall.  No reason disclosed.  Invited him to call.

	Reasons against: don’t want another W.S.C. speech.

			     want to have concrete proposals.

                                 		     C/Europe mtg. continues to end/month.



	Propose to stand firm.



E.Sh.	I had favoured somewhat earlier date.  Esp. to get ahead with extension of U.S.  Might have influenced W. Union Powers.

	What shall we do save Bill, in Sept?  Announce other plans eg. prodn.



P.M.	Somethg. on that.  Also Pay. Genl. defence sitn.

	One week wd. suffice.      





		3.	Defence: General Situation - Re-equipment.



E.Sh.	Prodn.  Details not worked out and some confusion.  3.400 m. over next 3 years.  Don’t know how much will go to prodn.  Must work it out.

	M/D. confused about amount of money available for prodn.  Now only £250 m. out of 1.780.  In 950 m. p’mme, rather under another £100 m. – some attributable to increased pay and some C.D.  Prs over £6.00 m. total over 3 years on prodn.  Not a v. large re-armamt p’mme.



H.G.	We told U.S. £3.400 m. with aid fr. them.  That included extra £800 m. for prodn.  Also asked U.S. for £550 m.  That means extra £250 ourselves. Pay and N.S. decn won’t make more than £50 m. diffce.

	On old decn of £100 m. detailed work is going ahead.  But planning is held up on rest because don’t know what U.S. aid will get.  Seemed unnecessary caution.  I therefore suggested re-appointmt of Ty. Inter-Service Cttee to allocate another £100 m. – bound to spend that, whatever U.S. aid we get.



E.Sh.	That £800 m. relates to physical capacity, not to what we mean to make.

	Essential need is early orders.

	Cd. P.M. issue directive to Cttee a) to get figures right  b) authorising orders to be placed.



H.G.	My decision will cover precisely that.  Wd. go up to £150 m. if necessary.  The rest must wait upon U.S. decision.



A.	Subject to close control of prices.



E.B.	Are priorities being worked out precisely, with U.S., to make efficient Army.  Shall we find ourselves with equipment and no men to use it. What machinery available for that?



E.Sh.	The first £100 m. only meets deficiencies.

	The rest – is no more than we need.  But balanced plan on E.B.’s basis can’t be made until we know final figure.



J.S.	Fitting in with balanced internatl force means unbalancg. our own. Can’t do that, even if we take the risk, until other forces are known.

	But P’mme B. wd. not include anythg. wh. wdn’t be needed on any view.



A.H.	Bldg. up R.A.F. – ques. is wthr. we shall have crews to man the aircraft ordered.



P.M.	Our Pay proposals are designed to meet E.B.’s point.



E.B.	It’s our responsibility to build up B. Forces: then decide where they shall be deployed.  So many places where R. cd. strike.  Mustn’t get commd to France.



E.Sh.	But unless we do enter into such commitments, W. Union Powers won’t do their part.

	Plans do exist for mutual support in W. Europe.  Now suggd our contn shd. be substantially increased.  Long way to go before we can get minimum of 20 battle worthy divns.

	We are expected to get 5 divns ready by next year.  I myself don’t think that’s enough – even 5 divns.  France wd. not then go higher than 10 divns.



A.B.	I assume standardisn of arms.  If we haven’t got that, where are we?



P.M.	Internatl un-balancing doesn’t arise for some time to come.



H.W.	Is there machinery for dove tailing in plans?



E.Sh.	J.W.P. Cttee.   



H.W.  	But has it statistical control over p’mmes.



E.Sh.	Machinery is ok for now.  Wd. have to be expanded if we went much bigger into re-armament.  We shd. then want a man i/c of prodn full-time.



P.M.	Consider.



E.Sh.	Standn is makg. good progress w’in limits of what is practicable.





		4.	National Service.



E.B.	Replies fr. W. Europe are disappointg.

                   y/	Alphand also takg. line tht. Fr. won’t take the first knock unless Br. and U.S. forces are already there.

	I therefore veer twds. Anglo-U.S. approach.  And favour building B. Forces on our own in our own way.  Can’t base our action on what Europe will do.

	Decide this issue on our own.



E.Sh.	Sitn in W. Europe is not satisfy.  But not hopeless.  Some improvemt in last 6 mos.   Dangerous to “write it off”.

	We shd. go on with this, on our own responsibility.

	I’m again askg. C.O.S. to tell me what they wd. do if we fought alone.



P.M.	Clear the others won’t come along.  We must now give the lead.



A.B.	French: joint plan of action etc.

	Which gives us best leverage to bring others along.  I’m still doubtful. They are still at 1 year.  Suppose we cd. concert with them a common plan of 18 mos. for all – or even 18 for them and 24 for ourselves. Believe we cd. get more out of them thus than by unilateral action.



E.B.	Wd. only invite French to insist on y/.  I think we’ve made too many commitments already to W. Europe.

	W.S.C. and his European Army also will be seized upon by French as excuse.

	Make Atl. Pact (vice W. Union) the basis of all our defence prepns.

	We can then make firm Anglo-U.S. understanding.



P.M.	With 2 yrs. service we can say to France “we are providg. the divisions. What are you doing”?



A.V.A.	Agree.  But A.B. is right to draw our attn to our pol. diffies here.

	Labour Party Policy for years has accepted adequate forces only for collective security.

	W. Union Powers are in N.A.T.O.

	Somethg. therefore to be said for pressing W. Union Powers.  We cd. say tht. we too have Parly diffies: but are going ahead.

	Pleven deprecates unilateral action by us.  Put pressure on.



H.McN.	If we go ahead unilaterally, France will be back – thinkg. we have thus committed another divn. to fight in France.



	We were told this was necessary because our commitmts were increasing.

	Cd. we not say to France tht. these must be met fr. existg. forces, and we shd. have less for France – unless they will all come along on the U.S. proposal.

	Cd. we not threaten the French a bit more?

	Failg. that, do other Govts. realise tht. if pressed we shall say in H/C. tht. we approached them and got no response?



J.S.	W.O. case for N.S. increase doesn’t rest on major way basis – it is needed for another Korea incident, eg. in Iran.  It wouldn’t help for major war.



A.B.	Presents to Kremlin on 12/9 – a) breach in our Party   b) admission tht. other W. Union Govts won’t follow suit.  Major diplomatic defeat for us.



E.Sh.	The Kremlin wd. like even better a decision to rest at 18 months.

	Not much Parly diffy. over b).  Don’t have to say they refused: they are considering it.



C.E.	Necessary in order to get the N.C.O.’s.  No escape from it.



	Wd. have bn. nice if we cd. have added tht. as result, others are followg. suit.

	We shd. press them again, as soon as our decision is announced.



A.H.	R.A.F. is only 3 yrs. old.  Only 20.000 who served pre-war.  Our re-building plan assumed 1954/5 as target for balanced force.  The 3 yr. Service wd. help us: it wdn’t solve our problem.



H.G.	Favour this.

	Only ques. is wthr. we can force others to follow suit before we announce.

	a)  E.B. has tried and failed.

	b) We invite retort: how many divns will you guarantee to France?

	Any discussion with Spoffard?  



E.Sh. 	Decided not to.



A.	No reason to believe a 2nd attempt wd. be any more successful.

	I at least was convinced by merits of the case.



H.	Won’t help the Navy.  But I support it on behalf of other 2 Services.



P.M.	Clear tht. N.S. men are best material.



G.T.	Then treat them more generously than we proposed last week.

	“Manning-up an essential industry” can’t be done w’out cost.

	Regular pay for at least the last 6 months.

H.McN.	Then at least let us try to avoid increased commitmts to W. Europe.



		Agreed :	Increase N.S. by 6 months.

				M’tain  pressure on W. European Powers

				(after our announcement) to follow suit.



P.M.	How many men will be held longer than they expected?



E.B.	M/L and Serv. Dpts. shd. make a plan wh. will reduce the no. of cases of extreme hardship?  P’ponements and arrangements.

	Esp. those who expected release betwn. Oct. and Christmas.



P.M.	Greatest trouble is caused by short notice.  Cd. you let it start on 1st Jan.



A.B.  	Wd. lose you 50% of immedte increase.



		(N. Brook to arrange!)

	       x	To report to Cttee of Ministers, if required.   x



	Publication of White Paper.

	Shd. cover both points.

	Shd. be in newspp. next morning.

							           [Enter Robens.



		5.	Electricity Power Stations: Risk of Sabotage.



C.E.	Put Citrine’s suggestion.

	H.O. and M.I.6. both think it v. injudicious to take such action in advance.

	Nor at present is it wish to imply tht. Services are readily available in support of civil power.

	Series of panicky suggns of sabotage.  eg. Theseus.  May put ideas into head.					        H/Commons.



		{Advise Citrine not to take action at present.

		{Increase all practicable precautions.



Robens.	I agree.

	Electrical Union.  Anglo-U.S. refinery at Fawley.



G.A.I.	Support that view.  Strike over victimisation.
