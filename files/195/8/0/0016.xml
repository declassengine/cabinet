C.M. 42(50)							                     4th July 1950



		1.	Queen Mary’s Carpet.



P.M.	Letter of thanks from Cabinet – Agreed.





2.	Integration of Coal &amp; Steel Industries of Europe.	



							[Enter G.S., H.G., Robens. K.Y.

									   

R.S.C.	If appd in principle, officials cd. work out detail.



H.D.	Doubts about para. 11 – veto on investment plans.  Shd. rest with Council of Ministers.



R.S.C.	They have genl. power of direction.  But might be better to give them veto. 

	Ques. where shd. line be drawn betwn. policy and execution.

	Investment does not cover closing of particular works or mines.

	Save as in direct consequence of modernisation elsewhere.

	For considn.



A.	Para. 15 – dual pricing.



R.S.C.	Shall have to give it up before this organn comes into opern.



T.W.	Need for care – Durham wd. be unprofitable and S. Wales also, if the addl £1 for export were lost.



H.W.	N.C.B. equalises betwn. regions.



R.S.C.	Council wd. have to settle this.  Price policy wd. be their affair.



H.M.	Salaries of executive?  



R.S.C. 	If 6 only, it wd. be whole time heavy job. If 12, half wd. have less to do.



A.B.	Investment – where shoe pinches.  We shd. start by reservg. that power to Ministers.  Might devolve later.



R.S.C.        x/	I accept that.   

	

	Agreed: power over investment shd. be reserved to Council of Ministers.  Perhaps under para. 12.



H.McN.	I wd. go further. It is for Govts. to stimulate demand: and for them to notify Council.  Paras. 11-12 shd. be recast.



A.B.	a) improvement of technical efficiency of existg. plants.

	b) increase in total productive capacity.



	At some stage more prominence shd. be given to (b).  A more

                  y/	organic connn with financial mechanisms of investment save inflation.

	Otherwise will ship back into cartel conception.



P.M.	Cttee shd. keep under review.  Genl. principles approved.

	Officials to work out details.



A.B.	And further thought to y/.  



R.S.C.  	Para. 10.



H.D.	Say also we look to expansion, to meet needs of 6 ward areas.  Elaborn of this point is essential.



P.M.	Service to world – not to Europe only.

		Agree, subject to x/ and y/.



R.S.C.	Timing.   E.B. wants now to communicate to Schuman our attitude as defined in debate.  Leave it at that until Schuman asks for U.K. views. We mustn’t accentuate diffies w’in French Cabinet.



P.M.	Must deal only with Schuman and only thro’ approved channel.

	Don’t chatter to others.

	If it fails, they wd. be glad to put blame on us.



R.S.C.	Agree.  Belgians are oiling out on “our” grounds.  They wd. be glad to blame us. (cf. today’s Times).



H.McN.	We may still get blame if we don’t make our posn plain.



R.S.C.	We cd. do that later.

	Point is: shd. I be drawn by Petsche and others who are opposed to Schuman on this.  E.B. wants me to leave it to Harvey.



K.Y.	Para. 2. was written before new Govt. formed.  The new Govt. is much the same and is more solid for Federation.  Posn is stable pro tem.



G.W.	Don’t talk this week.  But is it wise to decide now to say nothing until we are asked.  When it’s ready, we shd. consider putting it to Schuman – of our own initiative.



A.B.	Support G.W.’s view.  We shd. be ready to seize any favourable opporty to announce.



P.M.	No need to decide that now.  No disclosure this week.   Agreed.



A.B.	Para. 7. “internatl status” I’m against it.  

J.  	So am I.

			{Took note of pp. by M/Defence and C.R.O.

			{Further attentn can be given to them by the Cttee.



H.D.	General.  Para. 11.   “ …. in those countries wh. can be produced most efficiently”.  Not safe – unless defence considns are taken into a/c.



G.W.	Informn to Comm. Govts?  



P.M.  	Not yet.  Leaks.





		3.	Korea.						[Enter C.E.



		Parliamentary Debate.



P.M.	Tories will table Motion if we don’t.  We’d better do it.



K.Y.	Produced draft Motion.				Agreed.



P.M.	Somethg. shorter.  Resist aggression.  Support Security Council.



H.M.	I shd. announce this afternoon.  Names : P.M., L.P., E.B., C.R.O., Att.G, M/Def.



		Legal Issues.



P.M.	Shd. I avoid legal points altogether?



J.	I wd. try to.  Letter in Times today.

	Art. 27 = trouble.  Affirmve votes of 7 members includg. perm. members.



	Argument: as one perm member wasn’t there S. Council cdn’t decide.

	Answer: practice of regardg. decns as valid despite absence of a perm. member.



H.McN.	R. have raised no objn.  But have gone on record tht. they don’t think its right.



P.M.	U.N. was intended to work.  Must make it do so – takg. advantage of use and work which has grown up.  Shd. like to say so, positively.



A.B.	Sec. Council has acted before w’out strict adherence to rules.

	There are 2 U.N.’s – one in Charter and one in reality.  It’s the latter wh. we want to work.



J.	Art. 51.  “ …. inherent right of individ. or coll. self-defence in event of aggression v. a member”.  This is strength of our posn tho’ S. Korea not a member.  I wd. stress that.

P.M.	U.S. appealed to that because otherwise fait accompli.



K.Y.	Must base our action broadly on U.N. – even if there are quibbles about Articles of Charter.



H.McN.	U.N. has taken v. important decisions on votes of less than 40.





		Parliamentary Debate – other points.



E.Sh.		Ques. will be asked about forces.  eg. land forces.



P.M.		We haven’t yet bn. formally asked.  Can only say we shall consider, if 		asked, 	in light of other commitmts.



E.Sh.	C.O.S. have decided v. sending even token land forces.



K.Y.	U.S. action re Formosa has freed Chinese armies for other opns eg. V. H. Kong.



E.Sh.	They may do this to save face.



		Economic Sanctions.



K.Y.	U.S. already stopping trade to N. Korea.

	This doesn’t cover strategic exports – in other memo.

	No diffy in stopping trade fr. U.K.  Shd. do it, to help H. Kong Govt. to lay on embargo on their trade to N. Korea.

	If we are takg. mil. action, this action follows a fortiori



P.M.	Agree: but not to China.



	Proposals re N. Korea approved.



K.Y.	China.  Ask Shell not to increase supplies.



P.M.	Can’t go further.



K.Y.	Techn. point.  They aren’t economic sanctions under Art. 44.

	Refer to this publicly as “blockade” via “sanctions”.



J.G.	Wd. help H. Kong if they cd. take power to control exports to all destinations.



H.W.	As we did when controllg. strategic exports to E. Europe.



R.S.C.	H. Kong can’t do it effectively.



P.M.	Don’t do it.



A.B.	We can do it. But are we going to do it from H. Kong?  Suggests H.K. = imperial possn which we shall use v. China.  Surely U.S. cd. see this was provocative.



R.S.C.        / 	Take genl. powers as proposed.  Apply at once to N. Korea.

               x /	Consider when time is ripe wthr. it shd. be applied to China.

                  /	Tell U.S. we shall do this.



H.McN.	Why draw back now, when there is urgency, from agreemt. we made 12 mos. ago to do this thing – fr. H. Kong as well as U.K.



A.B.	At that time U.S. policy was to w’draw fr. China.



J.G.	Enough to take powers to prevent export of these strategic materials fr. H. Kong and Singapore and that Govrs. will do their best to stop such exports to China, as well as N. Korea.



E.Sh.	Don’t pledge ourselves to take undue risks.

	We have given more R.N. ships than U.S. had there – tho’ it’s supposed to be a U.S. sphere of interest.



	Agreed : as at x/. above.



		Formosa.



K.Y.	Full implicns of U.S. action will be put to Cab. later.  This is only for purposes of debate.



P.M.	Difficult line.  I shd. try to dodge it.



H.M.	May be outside terms of Motion – out of order.



K.Y.	We haven’t committed ourselves to support of this U.S. action.



R.S.C.	Can say tht. U.S. have stopped fighting betwn. 2 sides in China.

	Take note of memo. and hope for the best.



G.W.	Can I tell Australia we don’t intend to object to U.S. action v. Formosa.



P.M.	Stall.					[Exit Robens, K.Y. and G.S.

						[Enter W.W., R.R.S., B.



		4.	House of Commons : Kitchen Committee.



H.M.	As in memo.  Suggest investign – maybe also accounting enquiry before  H/C. goes further into this.

  

	After discussion – memo approved.



		5.	Soap Rationing.	[Exit W.W., R.R.S. and B. &amp; H.M.

						[Enter M.W.

M.W.	As in memo.



R.S.C.	Awkward we weren’t consulted – thro’ Prodn Cttee.

	Cd. we have some regular machinery.

	Export drive: supply posn of fats.



H.W.	We shd. welcome de-rationing.

	Increased prodn wd. give us more glycerine – wh. wd. be useful to us.



	Approved.

	To Prodn Cttee in future.		[Exit H.G. and M.W.





		6.	Scottish Affairs.



H.McN.	For informn.



A.	Rather abrupt.





		7.	Meat Strike.



C.E.	Maintenance men are workg.  Skilled R.N. men, detained to take their place, can now return to duty.

	Next week may have to go into docks, to unload ships.  Em. Cttee must consider implicns.



G.A.I.	Loss of man power: 3.500.  No indicn of extension of strike.

	Smithfield.  I believe a threat wd. do harm.  Ques. has bn.   	      [Exit J.

	raised in Press and there is a P.Q. that’s enough.  A soft answer wd. be wiser.



A.B.	Cd. D. &amp; M. Cttee get R.A.S.C.: Rlway Executives to consider Smithfield problem?



H.D.	Transport experts already brght in.  



P.M. 	Get R.A.S.C. in.  H.D. will consider.
