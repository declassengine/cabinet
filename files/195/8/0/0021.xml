C.M. 48(50)							                   20th July 1950



		1.	Korea.		[Enter K.Y., H., Att G., Wheatley, Ogmore



P.M.	Considerg. statement re exchanges thro’ Gromyko.

	Tass have now released ex parte report.  Repeatg. Sov. soln of Sec. Council and China: repve of Korean people.



R.S.C.	Unusually fair summary.



P.M.	Think we shd. make statement today.



K.Y.	Wd. then have to omit final commn now under considn in W’ton.



P.M.	Thought we were only informg. W’ton.   



K.Y. 	No: consultg. them.

	Hope to get it cleared and delivered tomorrow.



P.M.	Tell Kelly to go ahead.  And let us announce tht. H.M. Amb. “has bn. instructed” to give this reply.

	U.S. President’s Message to Congress.



P.M.	Welcome to Truman’s message.  Read draft.

	We ought to indicate tht. our belts have bn. tightened for years past.



R.S.C.	Statement fr. Downing St. will suffice to meet Frank’s view.  



K.Y. 	Agreed.



H.D.	Awkward to do it in H/C. – diff. Ques. re Formosa etc.



A.B.	Shd. decide what we mean to do if hostilities brk. out over Formosa.

	Diff. for us to follow U.S. lead on that.



R.S.C.	T.’s statement qua Formosa is improvemt. on earlier.

	Agreed : Put out statement from No. 10 before Ques. Time.

	On content: careful not commit ourselves to doing more: but equally careful not to give U.S. publ. opinion chance to grumble tht. we are leavg. it all to them.



H.McN.	Is it wise then to make any welcomg. statement at all?



P.M.	Franks doesn’t suggest we shd. say what we are going to do.



	Agreed: From No. 10.  Limited to welcomg. this lead.



							           [Exit K.Y.

		



		2.	Subversion Activities.



C.E.	Disturbed to find powers not available to deal with offenders if it’s found tht. P’smouth explosion was sabotage.

	Has happened in Austr. and France.

	Malaya: same issues wd. arise if supplies to them were hindered.

	Shd. take adequate powers.



Att.G.	Existg. powers are inadequate.  We aren’t at war.  Acts wh. wd. be treason in war can’t be punished.

	But need to consider form.

	Mistaken to link these powers legally with U.N. Charter – For



	i)  not actg. in pursuance of legal obligns under Charter.  (ii) Also opens door for argument. (iii) Coll. security action might be taken not under charter (because of Veto) but under H.M. Pact.

	Act enablg. H.M. lg. O-in-C. to make it offence to do any act intended to interfere with supplies to H.M. Forces in action operations or calculated to assist forces opposing us in those operations.

	Wd. that go too far?



J.	Put the powers in Act, and let O-in-C apply it only to given occasion.

	To avoid criticism tht. you are re-enactg. D. Rgs.



Att.G.	Might be diff. to prove knowledge of connn with particular opns.



P.M.	Do you intend legn before Recess?



C.E.	Not possible to resolve legal diffies in time.  But if Parlt. had to be recalled in Recess might have to do it then.



H.M.	Fancy Att.G.’s line.  Will be troublesome – Silverman and civil liberties.

	But serious gap in powers.  And this danger fr. Comm. is greater than from B.U.F.



A.B.	Diffies over “intent”.



J.G.	Anxious to avoid saying “war” in reln to Malaya.



P.M.   	Can’t rush this thro’ before Recess.

	Approve in principle; but let officials consider in greater detail precise form of legisn.



H.	M/D. welcomes.  Admy do in particular.  Alarming signal re P’smouth.

	No room for doubt tht. fire originated from thermite fuse planted.

	Ship was going to Korea.  Intended to stop it sailing or destroy it at sea.



H.M.	Cd. we bounce legn thro’ on this basis.

Wh.	Against framg. it on para. 6 basis – agree with Att.G.

	D. Regs pattern (para 3 of memo.) might help.  But are you going x/ to add the saving v. strikes?  T.U.’s wd. be concerned if you didn’t.

	Acts preparatory as under D.R. 90.

	Cttee of officials with draftsmen.		              [Re-enter K.Y.,



Att.G.	On x/ limit saving to legal strikes is furtherance of legitimate trade dispute.



		Agreed :	Admy to consult P.M. re announcement on 				P’smouth.

				Reject para. 6.

				Pattern of D. Regs.

				H.O. to convene Cttee to consider form of legn.



						[Exit Att. G. and Wheatley.

		3.	Parliament.				           [Enter W.W.



H.M.	Business for next week.

	Civil Defence: debate on 24/7.



C.E.	Our case is v. thin.



A.B.	Leave it therefore to Parly. Secies and take the line tht. we can’t use up economic resources in defensive prepns: must concentrate on active  measures.



P.M.	Be frank.  Can’t afford Civil Defence.



H.M.	Defence.  26/7.  One day only.  M/D. to open and P.M. to reply.



P.M.	Opposn told we don’t favour S. Session.  They have countered by demanding public debate.   W.S.C. didn’t return to charge last pm.



H.M.	Shall I repeat assurance tht. Parlt. will be recalled if needed?  



P.M. 	Yes.





		4.	Newsprint.				[Exit W.W.



H.W.	Not prompted by newspp. campaign, but my continuing solicitude for newsprint posn deterioratg. thro’ monstrous size of U.S. newspp!

	All that has happened is tht. they have had to go back to 6 pp. fr. the 7 pp. given them for purposes of Election.  No harm in that.

	But they now face further cuts and no prospect of going beyond 6 pp. in 1951.



	Rate of export to Australia.  Menzies wants more, so do S. Africa.

	We agreed in E.P.C. to increase to 100.000 t.  We cd. go higher now, at expense of U.K. newspp.  But diff. to justify even 100.000 – for Australian newspp. are bigger than ours and are fighting circuln battle.



	L.P. suggests minimum size below wh. pp. shdn’t fall and max. to wh. we aim to raise them.



R.S.C.	Import posn too uncertain for that.

	All we can do is to fix to 6 p. minimum.



H.W.	Then we must be ready to cut exports if necessary.



H.M.	V. bad thing if they went to 4 pp.  Must keep them at 6 pp.



R.S.C.	Mustn’t drop exports – long term contracts.

	Agree not to increase exports.

	Agree to dollar purchases for 2nd half of ’51.



O.	Another aspect to Canadian side.  We’re being pressed to waive prefce. ?Australia/Canada can get exports fr. U.S. and Scandinavia if prefce waived.



H.W.	Not so.  Real trouble is Scandinavia won’t supply to Austr. except on 5 yr. contract.



J.G.	Col. Govts. want early informn re their allocns for ’51.



O.	And S. Afr. will supply dollars for purchase of material.  Any objn?



H.W.	Yes: because not shortage of pulp, it’s shortage of capacity.

	S. Afr. plan doesn’t help.

	Recommn 21 (iii) – approved.

	Recommn 21 (iv) – propose to announce this today.



R.S.C.	 Make (iv) a condition of (i).



H.McN.	Surely going too far, in intervention.



H.W.	 Better not prs. to intervene as condn.  Relate to 6p. aim.





		5.	Ratification of International Labour Conventions.



G.A.I.	As in memo.



G.T.	Value: same as permissive legn in U.K.  Progressive l.a.’s bring pressure on backward l.a.’s.



	Diffy. is tht. we are represented unfairly in I.L.O. as re-actionary.



A.V.A.	Mrs. Roosevelt is forcing the pace on “reforms” at E.C.O.S.O.C. – in advance of U.S. Govt.



	Note taken.					[Exit Ogmore.





		6.	Colonial Service : Native-born administrators.



J.G.	As in memo.  Not discouraging.





		7.	Civil Service Salaries.	



	Secretariat were not present for this item.
