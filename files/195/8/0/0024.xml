C.M. 51(50)							27th July 1950



		1.	Mr Mackenzie King.				[Enter K.Y. W.W.



P.M.	Telegram fr. St. Laurent acknowledging Govt’s message.





		2.	Parliament.



P.M.	W.S.C.’s demand for 2nd day of Defence Debate in S. Session.  Worst of all worlds.

	Ques. now – who shd. speak today?  Prob. M/Defence (wind up).



H.M.	Reserve ques. until we see how it goes.



E.Sh.	Points to be cleared up.	i)  Shd. we send N.S. or others under 19 

	to Korea?  Must send N.S. men.  But if we can avoid sending under 19 yrs. old, it wd. be a good thing.  On physical 	grounds.



					ii) “£5.000 m. since end/war”.  Includes much increased expre on amenities (pay etc.,) wh. we shd. advertise.



 R.S.C.  	Also mention heavy terminals.  



					iii) Make public also tht. W.S.C. had no concrete suggns to make in the confl. talks.  



P.M. 	Let E.Sh. say this.  Why didn’t he send in memo. he promised?  



H.M. 	How far can you reveal what passed?  Agreed: “we await his concrete proposals”.

					iv) Main theme of speeches: Service pay. Have got Dean Rpt.: will discuss it with Serv. Ministers: want to see Ty. soon.



P.M.  	Agree we must take these points v. soon.  But no genl. increase.



A.V.A.	S. Sessions.  What are permanent records?  W.S.C. will make a set speech.

	For publn later – and no one will publish the reply – for no shorthand report.



H.M.	Business for week after Recess.



	Solicitors Bill.  Useful – private members Bill.  Any objn in principle to takg. this private members’ Bill fr. H/L. when H/C. has bn. denied time for such Bills?



C.E.	Precedent for Pets Bill on wh. similar tactics are contemplated.



P.M.	Dangerous precedent.



A.B.	If I were on back benches in H/C. I wd. protest v. strongly.



H.D.	Start it afresh as Govt. Bill in H/C.? next Session.



J.	I wd. be content with that – tho’ I wd. introduce it in H/Lds.   Agreed.



	Maintenance Orders.



J.	Defect discovered at last moment – amendment required.  Bill passed H/C.  Will mean returng. it to H/C. in October.



	Emergency Powers.



	Shall give notice today tht. Addresses will be moved in U.K. beginning 23/10.



	May have to give indicn about permanent powers.  Shd. it be H.M. and C.E.?



C.E.	No. H.O. interest.   H.G. via C.E.     Agreed.



					          [Enter N.B., B., H.G., G.S., M.W.,



		3.	Economic Powers Bill.



H.M.	Good Bill to have a row about.  Tho’ rather negative: good thing if we cd. think of ways of includg. more positive elements.



	Believe it wd. be better to seek permanent powers next Session than to continue to rely on annual renewals.

	Dpts. are broadly satisfied with powers in Bill.  Sufficiently comprehensive.



	Title: chosen for political propaganda purposes.  Preamble also included for those purposes.  Wd. it have any effect on interpretn by Courts? (2nd para. might include some reference to Parly control).



	Ques.	i)  Is this broadly the Bill Cabinet wants?

		ii) Is it to be in King’s Speech for 1950/51.

		iii) Will it afford a good occasion.



R.S.C.	Bill doesn’t match title.  Does no more than perpetrate war controls.

	Shdn’t move position powers e.g. Govt. factories, be included?

	If such a title, Bill shd. go to limit of Party policy on planning.

	Before Oct, add these position suggns i) A.B. sub. Cttee. ii) H.W.’s memo. iii) Party’s proposals.)



P.M.	Title doesn’t disguise what it is.

	H/L. wd. throw it out.  Is it therefore Bill on wh. we shd. invite challenge?

	My view is “no”.  Not unless it can be transformed into positive measure.



A.B.	Meeting next Tuesday on Govt. factories etc.  That wd. be one positive element.



H.W.	Concerned tht. Bill didn’t cover this.

	Not satisfied tht. price control powers are adequate.

	B/T. work on Consumers protn – might be considered for inclusion, tho’ I think not.



J.	I cdn’t support this Bill.

	Favour positive powers over narrow field.  But this Bill takes sweeping power over whole field – displacing Parly control w’out limit in time of peace.  H/L. wd. reject: would public feeling be with us or with them?

	If this Bill were in background, doubt wthr. H/L. wd. give annual renewals.



H.D.	Why: Bill only makes permanent what we have bn. doing for 5 years of peace.



P.M.	This puts v. baldly the negative character of war time controls.

	Merely fettering people’s initiative.



J.	Look at the width of the powers’.  Will be represented as attack on Parly procedure.



H.M.	Challengeable by Prayer.  Annual report.  This is less drastic than Supplies and Services Act.

	What alternative?  Rely on annual renewals?  If H/L. rejected renewal, they wd. wreck economic planning and wreck full emplt.



A.B.	World re-armament can’t take place w’out such powers as this to control inflation.  Climate of opinion will move in favour of such legn as this.  All democracies will have to do it.



P.M.	Remedy for that wd. be to renew war time powers.  Or at least Opposn would say so.



J.	When we know what positive measures we propose, let us consider then what form the legn shd. take.



H.G.	Agree – let us consider all powers requd for full emplt. policy and try to get them all in.

	If Korean situation develops, people won’t be interested in full emplt. but in anti inflation measures.  This is an anti-inflation Bill.



N.B.	People  wd. accept this as emergency measure.  But if it’s permanent legn we want somethg. more positive.



P.M.	This is all a question of timing.



		{Agreed in principle some permanent legn (includg. positive

		{features) shd. be ready by Oct.

		{Timing of introduction will need thought.



C.E.	Diffies with N.I.  For in peace these matters are w’in their competence.

	May have diffy. in persuading them to pass corresponding legn.



A.V.A.	There shd. be consultns eg. with Co-operative Movement.



H.M.	Suggd tht. I shd. take charge of the Bill.   



P.M.  	I think you should.





		4.	Economic Affairs.



R.S.C.	Shortages of coal, bricks and cement.  Latter being remedied by increased prodn (bricks) and imports.  Coal is worst case: import of coal is being suggd.



N.B.	Don’t think we need cut much off exports.  Am reportg. to Prodn Cttee. It’s only ½ mill. tons.



R.S.C.	That wd. endanger actual export contracts.



N.B.	N.U.M. have agreed to run output drive fr. Sept.  They hope to get 1 m. ton increase.  Wage incentive scheme.  Sampson strippers.  Also prs. Joy Continuous Miners (!) tho’ they cost dollars.



H.G.	Current Diffy. due to increased consumption – even more than fall in output.  Due to increased industrial prodn.



N.B.	Rising curve of productivity involves about 4 m. tons of addl coal p.a.



A.B.	Wage negotns (over lower paid) is dragging on too long.



J.G.	Communists will exploit this delay.



N.B.	Agree: but development has occurred. N.C.B. cdn’t concede original claim - £9-11 m. p.a.  Now offered £2½ m. settlement.  This can go to arbitn reasonably quickly.

							                           [Enter A.

R.S.C.	Import Prices. – continue to rise.



	Means lighter prices for our exports of rubber or tin, in dollars. But also we have to pay more in sterling.  Thus while st. area is doing well in dollars U.K. is getting into greater debt with rest st. area.



H.W.	Shortages now in soft currency countries.  We are being driven into dollars.





		5.	Iron and Steel Act.



G.S.	Saw Steel House leaders – invited them to suggest names.  They said must consult Executive.  Did so – reported tht. unanimous in declining to suggest names: tht. if anyone asked for their advice they wd. tell them not to serve and wd. forfeit trust of industry.

	M’while, have got a few candidates from outside the industry.  Have a Chairman but not many members.         



P.M. 	Carry on.

							[Exit 5 invitees + ? K.Y.



		6.	Services Court Martial.

							[Enter 3 Serv. Ministers &amp; Wh.



J.	I don’t decry workg. of existg. system.  We shall leave it as today subject to creation of Ct. of Appeal linked with C.C.A.  Appeal at instance of convicted person or reviewing authority.

	Two minor points –

	i)  “other ranks” on count.  Blackburn only member of Cttees who favours this.  Tho’ Att. is in sympathy.  Some such system in U.S.

	ii) “unanimity”.  If we had bn. recastg. whole system, strong case for it. But as we keep it, wiser to follow principle of Bench of Mags.



P.M.	V. satisfactory conclusion.



E.Sh.	Propose to accept Napier Cttee! recommns.



	i) above may provoke controversy.

	ii) above.

	What are we going to do about this?  A White Paper – indicatg. separate action on Army and R.A.F. with R.N. to follow with Pilcher main report (now in).  Or shd. we get on with considn of Pilcher and have legn cover all 3 Services a little later.  I favour 2nd course – esp. now tht. Pilcher final Report is in.



P.M.	Obviously must go forward together. Pilcher was our reason for not legislating earlier on Army and R.A.F.



	Agreed: legislate simultaneously even if unified system isn’t possible.



H.M.	Not in this Parlt.  Can’t control H/C. on this subject.  Service voters etc.



E.Sh.	We can limit it to ques. of appeal – on that there isn’t much controversy.



R.S.C.	Cd. limit it by title.



A.B.	Can’t escape controversy over i).



P.M.	Don’t believe “other rank” representn wd. be of any value in practice.



H.D.	Why not have it all the same.



A.H.	U.S. courts martials aren’t any worse than ours.  Accused has option to ask for “other rank” on the court – it isn’t obligatory.

	Officer nominates the “other rank”.



H.M.	Is this “pre war” atmosphere suitable for this legisln?



T.W.	V. diff. to get i) past the H/C.



E.Sh.	Can we purport only to deal with appeal ques. – under restricted title excludg. other matters.



A.V.A.	Will it apply to capital offences in war?



E.Sh.	Shall have to be careful about that.



P.M.  	Consider possibility of such a limited Bill.



H.McN.	Scottish soldiers shdn’t be subordinated to an appeal court modelled on C.C.A.  Wd. prefer some ad hoc Tribunal.



J.	Military law is law of England.



Wh.	Yes: don’t dispute that.  The point is: if you invent a court of appeal it shd. be independent of courts of either country.  Shd. be organised ad hoc, not linked to C.C.A.      



J. 	Will consider that.

				         [Exit Wh. 3 Service Ministers., C.E., H.M.



		7.	International Labour Conference, 1949.



G.A.I.	Transport Conventions – as in memo.           Agreed.



	Migration for employment.

	Cannot accept Annex I.

	Can accept Annex II.

	Cannot accept Annex III – customs duty.



	We therefore wish to accept Convention less Annexes I and III.



A.B.	Will it help movement of labour from Italy to France.



G.A.I.	No.



	Miscellaneous Migration.

	Can accept all save para. 14.
