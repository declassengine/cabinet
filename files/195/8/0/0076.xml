C.M. 22(51).				22nd March, 1951.



	1.	Public Expenditure.             [Enter  G.A.I., H.H.M., E.Summ.



H.G.	Vote on Account, despite all pruning, shows a rise.  Mainly due to

		defence etc.  But £135 increase on Social Services.  Will be

		pressure on o.a.p.’s &amp; I have worked out scheme with M/N.I.

		Basic for over 70 – fr. 26/- to 30/- for men:  &amp; 42/- to 50/- for

		both.  Also increased increment for staying on after 65 –

		1/6 vice 1/- p. 6 months.  Giving £3.15.0 p. wk. for married

		couple, man havg. worked until 70.  Part of policy to get 

		people to work to later age.  Permitted earnings limit shd.

		equally go up to £2 p. wk.  Child allowce to 7/6 – for widowed 

		mother:  not yet agreed.  This wd. all cost £40 m. in full year

		(20 in 1st).  Makes rise in S.S. expre next year to £50/60 m.

	N.H.S.  Last year £393 m.  This year:  estimate was £423.  I asked

		Dpts. to get below 393.  Came to concln this was unattainable…..

		After deadlock, E.B. suggd ceiling on N.H.S. as for food

		subsidies – at £400 m.  I’m ready to accept that, if a final ceiling.

		Health Ministers wd. then make charge for teeth &amp; specs. but not

		for prescriptions.



H.M.	P.M. advises Cabinet to accept this position.



E.B.	Believe this will command genl. public support.



H.M.	General power to charge wd. be wise.



J.G.	I wdn’t make charges variable by Regns.



H.M.	Promised to save £10 m. on hospitals this year.  Can’t do it next year.

		If ceiling is to be m’tained, I shd. rely on charges to provide addl

		money needed for hospitals.

	Principle:  people shd. pay when well.  Charges ought not therefore to

		fall on cases where people are ill i.e. g.p. or hospitals.  Glad

		therefore tht. prescriptn charge has bn. dropped.  Specs. &amp; teeth

		are in the main needed by people in health.  Charge for dentures

		wd. shift emphasis to conservation work.  That wd. be a good

		thing.  Specs:  no positive argumt. in favour of charge but

		children will be exempt, and free provn in hospitals will continue.

	O.A.P.  Hope existg. supplemn will be m’tained over &amp; above

		new rates.

	Final decn re charges needed to-day if charges to be introduced after

		Budget.  12/4 = date for introdn of Bill:  &amp; charges come into

		force from then.



A.B.	Prof. advice has bn. v. N.H.S. throughout.  Ignore such advice (e.g. fr.

		dentists).

	Early diffies of estimatg.  All resolved by 1950/51:  when exp’re came

		w’in estimates – despite the decision not to apply charge for 

		p’scriptn &amp; despite increased wages due to Whitley awards. 

		When I left M/H. there was surplus in hand.  V. remarkable 

		accomplishment.

	In period of rising costs, ceiling will be a drag.

	It’s re-armament, not o.a.p. scheme, which makes this cut necessary.

	Must we do this thing for £23 m. – in a Budget of £3.000 m. or so.

		Better far to cut Defence Estimate:  for the money won’t be

		spent because shortage of raw materials.  You will end with a

		surplus, &amp; sacrificed N.H.S. m’while.

	Politically v. unwise.  I’m not satisfied tht. reasons behind this attack

		on N.H.S. is financial.  3rd attack on it.  I can’t support Budget

		on this basis.  Nor the Bill – wh. wd. have to be carried by

		Tory votes.  Violation of every pledge to Party:  re-armament

		was to mean foregoing new advantages, not giving up existg.

		ones.



H.M.	P.M. supports H.G. and E.B. on this.

	We must recognise H.G.’s diffies.  We all want o.a.p. improvements.

	I don’t accept view tht. charge for some facilities is breach of Socialist

		principle.

	Ministers concern concur.  I think we shd. back H.G.



J.G.	This will be a set-back.  Will have pol. repercussions.  Another

		principle will be breached – uniform rate of benefits, i.e. no

		increase in o.a.p. w’out increases in other benefits.  This means

		o.a.p. can in future act as pressure group.

	i)   For this year £400 m. ceiling wd. be accepted by me.  But don’t 

		want Govt. to be committed to such a ceiling for years ahead

		because rising costs.

	ii)  Legn on charges will be awkward.  And we don’t want to do it by

		way of Regn making power.  What use wd. a future govt. make of

		such a power?



E.S.	I was against prescriptn charge.  A.B. adopted it.

	N.H.S. is best propaganda for Labour.  Mustn’t spoil it.  But people

		will not be upset by charges for teeth &amp; specs.  I don’t support

		A.B. on this.

	O.a.p.  4¼ m. qualified.  Only 900.000 supplemented.  Increases will

		apply to 3¼ m.  Widowed mother allowce to go to 40/- (one child)

		and 2/6 for each further child.



C.E.	My views are those of J.G.



H.W.	Diff. to accept view tht. N.H.S. cut is necessary to secure o.a.p.

		concessn.

	It is really due to re-armament.  We accepted £4.7 defence p’mme

		w’out much financial thght.  Doubt wtr. we shall spend the

		money effectively.  The £4.7 was not related to need or to what

		we cd. afford.

	This is an issue of principle.  I agree with A.B.  U.S. headlines will be:

	“Britain throws over Welfare State”.  And will play into Tory hands.



E.Sh.	“Light-heartedly accepted re-armament” (H.W.)  V. serious statement.

		Can’t say afterwards tht. Cab. didn’t take considered decision.

	A.B.’s attitude  i) assumes ceiling can never be imposed on N.H.S.

	Suppose defence still at £780 m., shd. we never have queried N.H.S.

		expenditure.  We were doing so.

	A.B.’s warnings of pol. reactions are overdone.  Wolf, wolf.

	H.G. has to find money in v. diff. circs.  Are we to say to him:  not

		a penny off the N.H.S.



T.W.	Accept H.G.’s plan:  so long as it’s presented in such a way as not to

		breach our principles.



H.D.	I support H.G.’s plan.  O.a.p. advantage will outweigh disadvantage

		of these 2 charges – in public opinion.



A.	Agree with H.D.  Must be a limit for time being – not necessarily

		for ever.



G.A.I.	Believe there is a case for increased w. pensions.  But I agree not to

		press that, in view of natl need &amp; circs.  Some small concessns

		made.



J.	Agree with H.D.



G.T.	I have had to add 1d to school meals – to avoid cutting into education

		standards, by modifying stat. duties of l.a.’s.

	Accept need to find the money.  These 2 charges cd. be defended.



A.V.A.	Support H.G.



H.M.	Genl. view of Cabinet:  in favour of H.G.



	[Part in concln, not heard.]

			                                                    [Exit  H.H.M., E.S. G.A.I.

			                                                    [Enter  P.M.G.

	2.	Post Office Charges.



N.E.	Have reached agreemt. with H.G.

	Cash a/c diff. fr. commercial a/c.  Latter shows £4 m. surplus.

		£8 m. wage increases likely this year.  Can only raise part of 

		that in this year.



H.G.	There will be cash loss w’out these increases.  Can’t have that.

		Diffy. only in presentn.



E.Sh.	Will increased charges lose any traffic?

 

N.E.	Taken into a/c.



G.W.	Consider retaing. differential betw. Gift &amp; other parcels fr. Commonw.



N.E.	Will consider:  no promise.



A.B.	P.M.G. will be in gt. diffy. because increasg. charges in anticipn of

		wage award.



P.M.G.	Shall relate increases to increased costs.  Tel. rentals will meet the

		wage cost:  can prob. avoid therefore appearance of 

		anticipation.

				          [Exit  P.M.G.



	3.	Japanese Peace Treaty.



H.M.	U.S. hope to circulate draft Treaty by end March.

	i)  Chinese Participn.  I prefer to take line tht. Peking Govt must be in.

	ii) Formosa.  As in memo.



E.B.	Endorse that view.

	China on F.E. ques. is as much a Gt. Power as U.K. or France on

		European.

	We can’t go back on Peking.



J.G.	For Malays etc., Japan is their Germany.  Can’t let Japan, after Treaty,

		be free to recognise Nat. Govt./China.



H.M.	I don’t advocate that.



J.	Legal analogy:  rest property in trustees.  Might be applied to Formosa.

		To be held under trusteeship until title of 2 competg. Govts.

		settled.



H.McN.	V. risky to assume tht. Peking govt. wd. refuse invitn to participn.

	All these theories get us nowhere.

	We shd. re-affirm our posn:  no negotns w’out effective Govt./China.

		But why hurry into negotns at all?  V. unreal:  Korea.  Gt. diffies

		with Colonies &amp; Doms.



H.M.	May be conference will be delayed.  But U.S. are moving:  we must

		put U.K. view to them quickly.



H.McN.	Then why add [  ] in 13(a)?  They evade v. real issues.



H.M.	Don’t need to say [  ] at same time.  Let me consider timing.



G.W.	Diff. views by Doms.  Make our posn clear re Peking.  But for the rest

		I prefer delay.

	Must inform Doms. as soon as we instruct W’ton.  And Franks

		might spk. to Dom. repves in W’ton before spkg. to U.S. Govt.



E.B.	More attentn will have to be given to India than in memo.

		A China/India axis seems more likely than Soviet/China.  On

		this, India is more important &amp; helpful than U.S.



H.McN.	V. doubtful about 13(b).



H.M.	How can I be more specific?  Play it all slowly.



			                                                      [Enter  H., N.B., G.S.



	4.	Integration of German &amp; French Coal &amp; Steel Industry.



H.	We are under strong pressure to agree because effect on Schuman

		Plan.  Asked to agree to 16-17% integration.  Much less than

		pre-war.

	German T.U.’s, at first hostile, now favour plan (holding company).

	Central Sales Agency:  we wd. leave it to Germans to decide its future.

		But Fr. &amp; U.S. have urged them agree disappce by ’52.

	We think all this inconsistent with Law 27.  But if we go on resistg. we

		shall be represented as hampering Schumann Plan.



G.S.	No need for excitement on our part.



A.V.A.	1)  Effect on U.K. steel industry.  2)  Attitude of Luxemburg.



H.M.	Unless it really matters to us, we mustn’t be holdg. Europeans

		back fr. federalism.



G.S.	Some separation is desirable:  but that is here proposed.



N.B.	Doubts re central Sales Agency.  On our experience we wd. favour

		retaining it.

	We want G. coal output m’tained.  Also an agreemt. re rational price

		&amp; sales structure.  Try therefore to keep it, if we can.



J.G.	Apprehensive because effect on U.K. miners.  Dangerous concentn of

		power.

			Memo. approved:  Dom. Govts. to be informed in good

			                               time.





	5.	German Coal &amp; Steel – Ownership.



H.M.	I stand by U.K. view.  Our High Commr. shd. insist on refce to Govts.

		if he is over-ruled.  V. important tht. this ques. be settled by 

		democratic decision of Germans.  I shall insist on this.  Otherwise

		the G. Socialists wd. have a grievance.

			Agreed.	                     [Exit  H.

	6.	Korea.



H.M.	Ch. resistce has weakened for some time.

	But 1) we are at 38th  2) Ch. not offerg. v. strong resistance,

		shd. we let opportunity slip of taking stock (U.S./U.K. and

		Ch/R.) &amp; stopping the thing.  Otherwise:  either MacA. will

		be tempted to go further north, or Ch. may come down s.

	Big responsibility if we don’t try for somethg.



E.Sh.	C.O.S. strongly opposed, as ever, to going n. of 38th.

	Tho’ Ch. haven’t mounted spring offensive:  negotns wd. be 

		prejudiced by any substantial crossing of 38th.  But also

		militarily unsound.  They favour stabiln on waist s. of 38th –

		incorporatg. Seoul &amp; Inchon.



H.M.	Possible course.  Declare aims:  send to others:  consult Doms. etc.

		See what happens.



E.Sh.	If U.S. dissent, we shd. go to U.N.



G.W.	Consult India specially:  possibly after going to U.S.  Shan’t get

		China along otherwise.



A.B.         x/	First need:  let war die down – to re-assure China re Manchuria.

	M’while, unwise to try to by-pass U.N.  Good Offices Cttee.

	Wait for x/.



J.	I agree.



H.M.	Good Offices Cttee are not doing anythg.  Our duty to take an 

		initiative.



E.Sh.	Unless we do take some action with U.S. Govt.  MacA. will go 

		n. of 38th.



			Agreed:  i)   Re-affirm our view on 38th.

			               ii)  Consider what further initiative cd. be taken

			                             now to get a settlement.



E.B.	No “notes”.  Verbal approach via Franks.



C.E.	Don’t take this out of U.N. framework 





	7.	Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.



H.M.	Wd like to have this discussed at Cab. after Easter.  (It can wait 

		10 days.)

			With a genl. memo. on M/E.



	8.	Economic Survey.



H.M.	Accepted by P. Cttee.

				[Enter M.W.



	9.	Farm Prices.



T.W.	Argument at stand-still.  Settlement will cost another £2 m. – on

		food prices.  Wd be wholly on milk.



M.W.	Much v. any further increase.



T.W.	¼d p. gallon on milk.

	And rise of shortage next winter, w’out it.

	Culling of dairy cows.

	1947 fuel crisis – we gave 7 m. credit to farmers.

		This year’s rain is [worse &amp;] more general in its effect.

	A break in negotns wd. be disastrous.



			Agreed:  H.G. to settle, in consultn

			               with M/F. &amp; M/Ag.



	10.	Parliament.



C.E.	Our tactics have heartened our supporters.

	We shd. not create the disorder.

	W.S.C. has sized on H.W. statemt. as reason for not negotiatg.

		I am grateful for that action by H.W. – given us tactical 

		advantage.  But Govt. (&amp; trade) must be carried on.  H.W. shd.

		promise no further diffies if we can get agreemt. on Parly

		tactics.



H.W.	This is war.  Legitimate to incite trade v. Tories.

	Work is going on in B/T.  No delay in makg. orders when Parly

		agreemt. reached.  Mtgs. with trade on technical level are 

		conting.

	????? wd. resent my w’drawg.

	Ready however to find conciliatory form/words.

		End my by stand when Parly talks begin w’out assurance

		of makg. orders unless Parly agreemt. reached.
