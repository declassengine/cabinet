C.M. 45(50)							                   13th July 1950



		1.	Queen Mary’s Carpet.				[Enter W.W.



P.M.	Q. Mary has written to thank Cabinet for their letter.





		2.	Parliament.



H.M.	Business for next week.



A.B.		Medical Bill.  Due in H/C. tomorrow.  Many Labour amendmts. may 		not finish.  Tories will, however, give facilities to get Cttee stage later.



H.M.		Adjournment.  28/7.  Resume 17/10.  Reorganise, if possible, after 2 		wks.  K. Speech on 31/10.  Opening of old Chamber Thurs. 26/10 at 10 		am.



P.M.		Defence Debate.  S.S.L. has asked for one before H/C. rises – they can 		have it.  He pressed for Secret Session.  Some case for it exceptionally 		here. 

		Deficiencies of Europ. Allies will be stressed – awkward to have this 		publicly.  Have sought E.B.’s views.  Appropn Bill – Wed. and Thurs. 		of wk. after next.

		Need for balance betwn. defence needs and losing cold war by trying 		to spend too much on defence.



E.Sh.		Serious deterioration since Korea.  ½ yearly report by U.S. Secy. for 		Defence is v. optimistic in tone – dangerous tht. it shd. have bn. publd 		at this time.

		What do we say to U.S.?  Cd. we rely on land forces fr. them in 			Europe– certainly not in M/E.

		What about defeatist attitude in W. Europe?

		How far shd. this sort of thing come out.



R.S.C.		Frank talks with Opposn followed by open debate?

		Any admissions in S. Session wd. leak out.

		Alarms re U.S. diffies + discouraging statements re Europe wd. have v. 		bad effect.



P.M.		Wdn’t satisfy W.S.C.



E.Sh.		There’s much more tht. cd. be said to him v. Europe.



P.M.		He knows all that – even tho’ we haven’t told him.



H.M.		Last Wedy on earlier Cab. decision, I defended in H/C. not havg. a S. 		Session.  What new circs?  Does Korea make it more desirable or less.

		Worrying to public opinion.  Effect on Russia?



P.M.		Tories are forcing a debate.  And open debate will be v. awkward.



A.B.		Effect on R. might be good.  For, assumg. they don’t want war, they 		must be as anxious as we and wanting to stop others’ re-arming.



									    [Exit W.W.

							[Enter B., N.B., P., E. Summ.



            	3.	Pensions in Socialised Industries.

							

H.M.		In various socd indies there were pensions for some employees under 		private enterprise.  Our line was: leave existg. men with their pension 		rights but give none to new-comers.  Awkward both ways.  If you 			conceded this to rlways, gas and electricity wd. follow and then 			miners, followed by steel workers.  Might mean £27 m. fr. our Bds. 		and workers. Told T.U.C. workers hadn’t realised level of their contns.



		Private enterprise wd. then be pressed to do the same.

		Price increases wd. be inevitable.  And re-action on o.a. pension rates.

		On other side T.U.C. may have to give way to pressure on this.

		Labour Party Policy Cttee have proposed enquiry (para. 9).  Might last 		some time.  Wd. produce facts.  Possible compromise to put to T.U.C.

		Another review by M/N.I. might be linked with this.

		Departmental Cttee wd. do. R. commn (wh. wd. take longer) wd. be 			regarded as putting it all off.



R.S.C.		16 : 100 to 31 : 100.  Reln of wage earners to pensioners.  Estimate 			(1946) of Govt.  Actuary.  V. marked tendency – even if figures can be 		revised in light of rising birth rate.

		Examn shd. therefore include ques. of retiring age.  Pension at later age 		wd. be only way of easing load – wh. wd. otherwise involve intolerable 		increase in c/living.



N.B.		67% in electricity and 70% in gas were covered by insurance schemes.



H.D.		Will the schemes become insolvent if new entrants don’t come in.



R.S.C.		Most of schemes are insolvent already because of increased expectn of 		life.

		14% in coal are covered, includg. 80.000 miners.



N.B.		I favour enquiry.



E.S.		I also support it.  But stress importance of getting balanced and 			experienced members on Cttee.  Also wide t. of r.

		Believe retiring age shd. be considered because of increased expectn of 		life.

		Existg. rules reflect attitude of 19th century.



B.		Enquiry won’t avoid serious trouble on rlways.

		Loco. Union lately refused to associate themselves with appln for wage 		increase because attd more importnce to suppl. pension scheme.

		Loco. men feel v. strongly on this.  Lengthy enquiry won’t be 			acceptable to them.  Week-end strike will prob. be technique – wh. are 		worse than big strike which comes to a head and finishes.

		If Govt. can’t accept suppl. schemes, it wd. be better to come out quick 		and firm and say so.  With delay while enquiry proceeds, ill-feeling 		will increase.



A.B.		Mayn’t enquiry pile up trouble for us.  Will show up inequities betwn. 		professional classes and manual.  What we want to do is provide suppl. 		pensions only for those indies wh. we find it diff. to man.  Pensions 			keep men in an occupn up to retiring age.  Want them on that a/c for 		miners.  This line wd. be better than increase in genl. pension rate.  		Wd. help to fill gap left by our failure to devise an effective wages 			policy.

		Enquiry, if we have one, shd. not be limited to facts but shd. work out 		a policy on above lines.



H.M.		Argument ad hominem (miners)

		5 day wk. began with mines.  It’s more universal. (Disagreement).

		Doubt if you can deliberately discriminate betwn. industries.

		Spending millions on S. Services.

		Productivity increases – we have spent most in advance.



P.M.		Danger of continuing pressure to do more for the old.

		One day the young will kick.



G.A.I.		Support enquiry because of ramifications.

		Trouble with Unions: principle tht. they shd. be free to make a deal

                  x/	with employers.

		M/H. suggn is attractive at first sight.  But can you manipulate 			pensions like this?

		What value have we had fr. offer of increased pensions if they work 		after 65.

		Many men in my Union are workg. well after 70.

		Cd. that idea be exploited equally in any supplementary pension 			schemes.



G.T.		Support G.A.I.

		Industies wh. enjoyed these schemes were assocd with l.a.’s – and this 		was resented by other indies whose workers had to pay for it in higher 		prices eg. for gas.

		Favour enquiry. But cd. it be wider – suppl. schemes only by 			individuals, not by industries, and thro’ N.I. scheme.  That wd. get rid 		of much diffy.



J.G.		I attended T.U.C. discn last year – Council nearly defeated.  x/ was the 		trouble: since natn workers have lost right to negotiate such schemes 		with employers.

		Favour enquiry if T.U.C. can be persuaded to agree to it.

		T. of ref. need re-constitn.  Most existg. schemes are by firms: men 			want them enlarged so tht. man can preserve his pension rights on 			leavg. original firm.  Omit para 1) “management and soundness of 			existg. schemes”.



		Cd. we accelerate N.H.I. enquiry?  If not formal enquiry, then some 		linkage of this and N.H.I. schemes – includg. pension age under N.H.I. 		and also wthr. bonus for continuing in work thereafter cd. be increased.



H.D.		Don’t accelerate statutory enquiry N.H.I.  That wd. go beyond 			pensions.

		Have a wide enquiry on supplementary pensions.  Make it fairly quick.



		Agreed: wide enquiry: H.M. will settle t. of ref. and 					membership with Ministers concerned and report to P.M.

		Take this line with T.U.C.

            	4.	Involuntary Absenteeism in Coal mining.

									[Enter W.W.

N.B.		Certification. 



A.B. 		We agree : have already agreed to put them into operation. 



 E.S. 		Trouble is giving men a final week.  Doing our best with sick visitors.



A.B.		Don’t believe these figures.  We are getting men back to work more 		quickly than before.



R.S.C.		May be unwise to get men back too soon.



T.W.		Gradual cure – education etc.,



H.M.		Pity Lidbury Cttee didn’t use Social Survey and Human Factors Panel, 		as contemplated by Cab.



G.T.		Go slow with this long-haired stuff.

		Higher earnings is a greater cause of absenteeism than anything else.



E.Sh.		The flat-rate men are as well off under compensation as at work.

		Don’t pretend there’s no abuse.



N.B.		Agree there is some – hence paras. 4 and 5.



J.G.		Avoid keeping miner under microscope.  Don’t suggest that this 			applies only to miners.



H.M.		This is greatest problem of statesmanship in 2nd half of 20th century.

		Don’t dodge it. And don’t let socialised indies lead the way.

		Tragic if consequences of better condns is more slackness.



R.S.C.		Much scientific study on this eg. in B.I.M.

		Facts in this report shd. be made available to those bodies.



H.W.		Danger tht. this wd. spotlight the miner again.



A.		Those reports have no edge – sloppy guidelines, leading us nowhere.

		Plenty of research of a sort: but needs discipline.



		Memo. approved in principle.

				

			                                                                     [Exit E.S. and W.W.

               	2.	Parliament (resumed).				          Enter K.Y.



	   	Defence Debate.



P.M.		E.B. is against Secret Session.  Read letter from E.B.



T.W.		Hasn’t there bn. S. Session in U.S.?  



K.Y.  		No: only routine mtg. of Cttee.



R.S.C.		E.B. suggests giving W.S.C. confl information.



K.Y.		Includg. telegrams to U.S. Govt.



P.M.		This won’t divert him from his demand for S. Session.



E.Sh.		These telegrams aren’t relevant.  W.S.C. is concerned about internal 		ques: condns of our Forces.



A.		Stress E.B.’s point re French Govt.



P.M.  		Preponderant opinion v. S. Session?  Agreed.



A. 		You can’t avoid it.



A.B.  		Let P.M. have discretion to decide, in light of Tory pressure.



H.D.  		It’s for us to decide.



P.M.  		I think genl. view favours open Session





            	5.	Short-term Measure to Increase Coal Output.



N.B.		Table on p. 5. Big return on N.C.B. investmt already – and will 			increase.

		Ques.	i) Para. 27.  Wage incentives.  Hope this may succeed.

			ii) Final para.  Quick return fr. more investmt.

		    Not sanguine about this.



H.D.		Para. 23.  Need for gt. care.  Men won’t always go.  Hope N.C.B. 			aren’t over sanguine about this.



N.B.		Of course it needs care.  N.C.B. always work with N.U.M. on this.

		467 uneconomic pits are workg. today and producg. 55 m. tons p.a.



H.D.		Eric Young is quite incapable of understanding psychology of miner 		on this ques.



A.B.		V. good report.  Healthy technical situation. 



J.G. 		Agree.



A.B.		Open-cast.  Aren’t N.C.B. frightening people unnecessarily by bore 		holes?



N.B.		It’s not N.C.B. but my Dpt.  



A.B. 		Consultn with M/H (water) T.C.P. and M/Agr. before bore-				holes are sunk at all.



P.M.		There shd. be consultation.



H.D.		I’m consulted before working is decided upon.  Haven’t yet asked for 		earlier consultn.



P.M.		There shd. be – for may be social reasons wh. rule out any possibility 		of working open-cast.  Must be reasonable hope of coal and hope of 		workg. it.



H.D.		Policy: reduce open-cast and continue uneconomic pits at a loss.



E.Sh.		13 m. tons p.a.  V. unwise to close down on it.



N.B.  		Para. 30.  Is it worth pursuing?   



P.M.  		No: L.P. Cttee.



		Labour Relations: in Mining.



G.A.I.		Para. 8.  More and shorter strikes.

		At outset N.C.B. officers were too remote.  Better now (para. 1).

		Ready acceptance of arbitn decisions.



P.M.		Proof, in these figures, of unsatisfactory management.  Appalling no. 		of strikes.

N.B.		V. gt. progress in last year.  Of 15.000 disputes, 13.000 were settled at 		pit level by conciliation level.

		Pre-war mines accounted for ⅔ of all days lost.  This year only 1/5th.

		Feeling twds. Bd. is changing.



J.G.		More power to local manager and local repve of men.  Real remedy.



R.S.C.		Figures reflect full emplt. = increased power and influence of strikers.

		Heavy increase from 1943 to 1948.



H.W.		Actually figures pre 1942 weren’t so good.  Therefore post-war 			improvement is even greater than appears.

									

									[Exit N.B.

         		6.	Japanese Peace Treaty.			[Enter Ogmore.



K.Y.		No re-actions yet fr. Comm. Govts.

		Time we took initiative.

		Cost of this report cd. go to U.S.  All save i) some B/T. point 28 and 34 		and ii) Annex B.

		Korea needn’t alter our intentn to acquaint U.S. w’out commitmt

		Want therefore to send to U.S. if other Comm. Govts. agree.



O.		Support this.



E.Sh.		Paras 16-23 = defence.  No objn to despatch to U.S.



H.W.		The incln of trade sections (28-34) will embarrass us on m.f.u. for 			Japan.



		Approved.					[Exit K.Y. &amp; Ogmore.





            	7.	Meat Strike.



C.E.		Can’t get ¼ of carcase meat, but will make up balance in bully.

		Trouble because of requiring men to pay own fares to places where 		they left lorries.



		J.K. will settle: men being given warrants m’while.

		Troops returned to duty at noon y’day.
