C.M. 74 (50)				                                                         16th November, 1950



1.	Parliament.



P.M.	Business for next week.





2.	Korea.



E.Sh.	Promised to make statement to-day.

	Statement is too long, as drafted.  But must go ahead with it.



P.M.	Add apprecn of behaviour of troops.



E.B.	Winter comforts – send them before a scram arises.



E.Sh.	Am looking into this.



A.B.	Diff. treatment of natl units in a U.N. operation.  Pay, comforts etc.

		Are we going for uniformity in future?



P.M.	Let M/D. look into this – tho’ v. difficult.



E.Sh.	N.S. men on lower ratio in Korea – am worried about that.



E.B.	All these ques. shd. be looked into – as this may be a long campaign.

		Cd. M/D., H.G. &amp; Service Ministers consider &amp; submit memo.





3.	Import of Turkeys.

					         [Exit W.W.

E.B.	Tried to see wtr. ban cd. be lifted.

	B. subject (Saunders) sentenced to 13 yrs’ impt.:  sanctions applied:  fatal to our prestige to lift them for sake of a little Xmas food.

	Firm attitude eg Sheffield Congress is essential.  Can’t show any weakness.



H.M.	Don’t agree.  Parly. Party won’t understand.  People are unhappy:  need cheering up.  Turkeys at Xmas = ancient institution.

		Will be politically diff. for Govt.



H.W.		E.P.C. discn on grain from E. Europe:  I suggested collective discn by Ministers – we never expected boy-cott to go on so long.  Have since had the mtg. with E.B. &amp; I now support continuance of boycott – necessary to secure reasonable commercial relations.  But cd. we not make exception for turkeys – only about £2m as cpd. normal £13m of trade.

	E.B. must judge political effects.  Econ. effects of boycott cd. be secured even with this exception.



E.B.	Make concession to turkey trade &amp; other trade will press for same concessions e.g. tomato puree, pickles, jam etc.

	Also effect (of showing weakness) on our boycott on Argentine.



H.W.	We can resist pressure fr. other trades.

                   x|	Blockade can’t be 100% because R. can supply her with essential sterling.  But it has made things awkward for her:  &amp; wd. in end force concession over Saunders.



Att.G.	Long-term value of these methods is doubtful cf. recall of Ambassadors.

		Support x|.

		Can’t spend dollars on Canadian turkeys because effect on Doms. 



H.McN.	Price will be too high for people – unless 2.000 t. cd. be found from Canada &amp; Hungary to bring price down.  H. supplies alone won’t suffice to do that.  So discn is academic.



H.W.	But we don’t know what supplies we can get from Hungary.



A.B.           y|	Are we able to use trade as instrument of f. policy?



E.B.	Ready to re-consider with Ministers.  But we must be ready to stand behind our servants – as behind a victimised man in T. U.



P.M.	That’s all right if it’s effective.  Any indications that it will be?



E.B.	Looked hopeful a few weeks ago.  Seemed we might bring it off v. soon.



P.M.	Inclined to support y|.  We are economically too vulnerable.



H.W.	F.O. have never asked us to do it.  In Hungary we are doing this to support an economic repve.  It is in the trade context.



E.Sh.	Traditional policy of U.K. is to protect our national repves.  Send a cruiser.  Are we not to chuck our hands in for sake of Xmas turkeys.



G.A.I.	Shall we break prices by importing these?  Hungary will ask a stiff price in these circs.  Support E.B.  Anyway, these turkeys won’t go into working class homes.



			Balance of opinion – in support of E.B.



E.B.	But I’m still willing to consider with H.G. &amp; H.W. wtr. any means can be improvised of increasg. supplies of turkeys for Xmas.

H.W.	Includg. apprecn of effectiveness of blockade.



E.B.	And use of economic sanctions generally.

2.	(contd) Korea.



E.Sh.	Another 2 pp. must go.



			Agreed:  condense.



	Supplementaries.  Future operations.  May be asked if we intend to advance further.  Say:  so far as requd to achieve U.N. objective &amp; want early terminn of hostilities.

	Signal from Bouchier  re bombing over M’churian frontier.



P.M.	Say:  not for me to answer f. policy aspects.  Fob them off.





4.	Defence:  Finance.



H.G. &amp; E.Sh.	[Not heard]



E.Sh.	Only broad outline of a plan wh. remains flexible in detail.



P.M.	All finance is open.  Depends what others do.  No final decision is possible.



E.Sh.	In W’ton I made it clear tht. our £3.600 p’mme was dependent on other factors.



H.W.	Our officials are handling this well – M.A.C. &amp; Nitze etc.

	Important tht. we fight hard for method of sharing burden wh. will be favourable to us.  E.g. % age of national income wdn’t take sufft. a/c of our efforts since 1938.

	In this fluid condn, risk is tht. size of M. Term Plan will crystallise first.

	Recognise 3-stage method., works in U.K.;   but will it work in reln to Pentagon?  Will N.A.TO. 3rd stage deal as firmly with mil. estimates as Cab. does with C.O.S.?  Mayn’t U.S. say this is minimum to save world from aggression?  Even £5.000 M wd. be physically more than U.K. economy cd. stand.



A.B.	We must also avoid situation in wh. U.S. helps us to afford what N.A.T.O. thinks is necessary for defence.  Politically unacceptable.



P.M.	We can do it 12-power sharing common burden.  If it’s too much, cut it down.  We can’t have U.S. contribn to our national defence.



E.Sh.	We must use this as means of forcing larger U.S. contribn of troops.

		And Canadian contribn of munitions and air-crew training.



H.G.	Ty. offls. in Nitze talks are urging tht. basis be £3.600 &amp; corresp. W. Eur. figures vice Mid-Term Def. Plan.



G.W.		i) Our commitments outside N.A.T.O.  Are they covered in Nitze?

		ii) Para. 3 (5) of Ann. I.  A financial contn by Doms. wd. be unacceptable especially while Doms. are outside N.A.T.O.



H.G.	On i), we have made our posn plain – para 16.

		See p. 11:  para 6 of Annex II for our view.

	On ii), more diff. ques. arise.  U.S. 3 (5) is because profits made by r.s.a. countries:   this is their come-back,  Gone no further yet.



E.Sh.	Premature to try to associate Doms. with N.A.T.O.



P.M.	Cab. will endorse recommn of Def. Cttee. &amp; others in para. 30.



					[Enter N.B., B.

5.	Coal.



N.B.	Causes:

i)	Increased consumption.

ii)	o.n.s. increase is less than was assumed.

	Plowden Cttee’s recommns

a)	lighting:  diff. before Xmas.

b)	Coke control:  I am considering.

c)	bunkers:  300.000 t. is maximum



(M/T. &amp; I agree)

	This brings us to imports.  Diff., I know:  but lesser evil than fuel crisis.  4 years ago Tories attacked us for not importg. before crisis of 46/47.

	Further cut in exports.  At present, I believe this wd. be unwise – recriminations, appeals to O.E.E.C., loss of imports.  Tho’ we shd.  have to face it if we can’t get 1 m. imports.  Cttee &amp; ONC shd. consider implications if we have to do it.



P.M.	Sudden change.  Thought cut in exports was said to suffice.



N.B.	Warned Cab. last time – incldg. refce to imports.



H.G.	I have always bn. reluctant to import.  Prodn Cttee were warned by M/F &amp; P.  I have now come to concln tht. we must import.

		If gap of 1 m. I wd. have taken a risk.  Stock figures for end/winter are larger than we planned for:  bunkers:  exports – we cd. have taken a chance.   But look at prodn trend.  It is too big a risk.  If we do import, quantity doesn’t make much difference.  So, if we do import, let’s get enough to cover our risks.

		Support appln for 1 m. tons of imports.

	Para 10 (2):  on lighting.  Politically as damaging as imports.  And if we import enough we cd. avoid this economy.  May have to do it later:  don’t do it now.

	Long term.	

i)	prodn drops is due to overall man-power shortage. v. dangerous phase. Must have big drive on man-power – with drastic decisions.

ii)	review open-cast p’mme.



J.G.	Inescapable concln on facts stated.

	V. disturbing.  Prodn curve seems to be turning down.  When all natural pull is for increased effort – Nov., when Xmas earnings are incentive.  Hope discns  with both sides of industry will be initiated.

	Man-power.  We have made mining areas so much more diversified tht. coal has to compete in order to get &amp; hold its men.

		Here also, inducements.  Wages won’t do.  Try pensions.

	After enquiries into 2 recent disasters are complete, M/F &amp; P. must make it clear tht. confidence can be placed in our takg. quick &amp; effective remedial action.



N.B.	Output does drop after a disaster.

	But long-term remedies are also needed.

	Pensions is best bet.



H.W.	On para. 2 figures, imports are necessary.  Cd. we decide in principle to import; but suspend action for a week &amp; see how the figures go.  There was a drop like this in Nov ’43 and curve went up gain.  Let Ministers immed. concerned have discretion to implement as soon as figures are seen.

	Cd. we avoid it by buying coal abroad for Europe &amp; keeping our exports here.



B.	Bunkers.  If situatn is serious enough to warrant imports, I am willing to save 300.000 t. on bunkers.  Unwilling to go further to the 450.000 mark. because that wd. involve v. awkw. consequentials – controls etc., wh. wd. upset shipping interests.



G.T.	Must we assume tht. our miners won’t give us coal we need.  If they knew how serious posn was, surely they wd. put on a spurt.  Cd. we not discuss ques. with them – how much overtime is worked etc.



T.W.	Time-factor makes that v. difficult.

	Imports inevitable now.  But match this with positive action to improve man-power posn.

	Disasters do depress output.



A.B.	Support G.T.  Danger we shall incur pol. disadvantages w’out getting the easement.  Shall we get the coal?  It’s short in U.S. now.  Can’t we find out if it is available before Cab. asked to decide.

	Cdn’t. we get over tempy problem by appeal?

	Also greater economy in consumption – by appeals.

P.M.	Is there any coal?  



N.B. &amp; H.W.	Little doubt we cd. get some.



P.M.	Distribn of stocks?



N.B.	We are short on targets.   End/year target at 14m. can’t be reached with this dropping output.  This is well-distributed.



B.	We cd. distribute imports – with some diffy.





E.Sh.	Importing coal = political suicide.  After 5 yrs. of natn. Any other remedy shd. be sought first.

	Why has man-power dropped.  Because we gave them a stimulus. (5 day week).  They haven’t had another recently.  All they have had is a stupid arbitn award.

	Suppl. pensions.  No attraction to new entrants.  



J.G.	Prevents wastage.



E.Sh.	Shd. analyse stocks &amp; get miners together.

		There is sabotage at work.

	Wd. prefer to cut exports than bring in coal.



H.W.	Distribn of stocks.  Do M/F &amp; P. still keep track of stock figures of all consumers?



E.B.	Buy coal in U.S. &amp; hold it, w’out shipping.  Then send it where needed to fill our exports.

	Buy in Rhodesia too, if you can.



A.B.	Plowden’s Cttee shd. be a Ministerial Cttee.  These aren’t technical ques.



H.M.	Decide this a.m.  Can’t take these risks.  Do it E.B’s way.

	We prob. shd. see miners.

	Careful public statement.  P.r. work etc.



P.M.	Ques:  how you do it.  Put it across as for bunkers, Argentine etc., and don’t publicise it.



H.G.	Can’t be kept quiet.  Mght. wait a week or so.  N.C.B. wd. have to be asked.



A.B.	Get the leaders to Ldn. &amp; offer them pensions &amp; more wages.

		To get in before Comms. do. …



			Adjourned.





6.	Leasehold Reform



		Memo. approved.
