	Major diffy – divn into 13m. N., 6m. E. 6 m. W. = and N. mainly Moslem. Three main disagreemts in discns because N. (13 m.).



	a)	Regn on central legve Council.  N. asked for equality with E. + 	W. 

		Became clear tht. E. and W. wd. stay out on that basis.

	I believe this wd. be wise.  Want authy to do it.



H.M.	One genl. point.  Need to be sure they can work this – suppose J.G. is satisfied on that.

	But later on, they may get more independence.  Vital tht. by then they shd. have body of trained administrators, as well as politicians and lawyers. cf. I.C.S. and its gt. importance in new Indian republic.  How is this going in Colonies?  Is there any policy of “Indianisation”?



J.G.	V. important ques.  Students fr. W. Africa.  Scholars can be influenced in choice of profession.  Others can’t.  And I’m afraid too many of them are qualifying as doctors and lawyers.

P.M.	I also have spoken about this with Col. Dev. Corpn.
