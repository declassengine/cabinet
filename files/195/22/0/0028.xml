C.C. (63) 28 2nd May, 1963 11.a.m.

1. Parliament (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip: M/S F.O. (2): M/S C.R.O.

Ch. Duchy. As in statement.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral).

a) U.A.R.

M/S/ F.O. Must settle arms for Iraq soon. F. Sec. is explaining to Shah and other C.E.N.T.O. Govts. Defer decision until he returns. If he agrees, arms can go.

b) Jordan.

Pressure mounting against Hussein. He has promised elections in four months. If free, they might favour Nasser. But army loyal and immediate coup d‟état unlikely. Israel keeping calm: no general mobiln. But they would move if a coup in Jordan. U.S. have warned Nasser that they couldn‟t restrain Israel.

c) Yemen.

Agreement on Eg. withdrawal and cessation of arms from S.A. U.N. will police this. Eg. prob. won‟t keep agreement, since Sallal might then fall. He proposes to join new U.A.R. So does Algeria.

d) Laos.

S.U. probably want to maintain neutralist state. F. Sec. will try to pursue with S. co-chairman.

e) Cuba.

U.S. wants number of Br. ships trading with Cuba to be reduced. Already reduced by 50% since last October. F. Sec. will so inform Rusk.

P.M. M/Tr. to circulate note on this. How many are on charter – i.e. under contract wh. they can‟t break. Watch possible U.S. reactions if we merely defy them. Note shd. indicate these sanctions.

3. Public Order. C (63) 60 &amp; 71. [Enter M/S. S.O.: Att Gen.

Home Sec. As in memm. Proposed addns pointless and add nothing to existing law, adequacy of which has now been demonstrated. But we ought to legislate on penalties.

No public interest at moment: and M.P.B.W. has banned T‟ar Square.

But meetings elsewhere may lead to new arrests: and penalties shd. be increased as soon as possible.

Ch. Duchy. Law may be adequate: and public opinion may be quiet. But interest will thrive with new meetings and release of Jordan. We must be ready for a new fuss: and Parly opinion in both Parties, wd. favour Iremonger‟s amdt. If we do nothing, Parlt &amp; Jewish community may force our hands. Iremonger‟s Bill wd. win on a free vote.

L.Ch. Our purpose must be to enforce existing law. Iremonger doesn‟t change it or strengthen it in any way. May even cast doubt on earlier words in section.

Increase in penalties more important. Therefore Home Sec. shd. make his statement as soon as possible.

M/S/ S.O. In Scotland we have proceeded under common law, not 1936 Act. To import „race‟ might embarrass us in relation to S. Nationalism.

P.M. ? Adopt Iremonger‟s Bill and include penalties.

Home Sec. But how defend out action? It will make no difference.

M.Def. ? A higher penalty for racial incitement.

L.P. But why? Race is only one type of incitement: can‟t discriminate against others.

First Secy Responsible Jewish opinion and other racial groups would oppose importation of race concept. And privileged posn for eg. Jews wd. be opposed.

M/S. C.R.O. I agree, qua C.R.O.

Att. Gen. Iremonger‟s addn wd. complicate posn by suggesting some special degree of concern with racial incitement. This is contrary to all our tradition of equality before the law.

Ch. Duchy. It is arguable that extra words wd add something. They needn‟t be Iremonger‟s words.

M. Def. You can incite hatred without being threatening, abusive or insulting. ? Let this addn be made, without refce. to race.

M.H. We mustn‟t import race. Now that adequacy of law has been demonstrated, better not to risk discrimm for eg. Jews, wh. might not be to their advantage.

Ch. Exch. And even to limit addn to “words inciting hatred”, even tho‟ subject to proviso about breach of peace, might jeopardise normal political speeches.

Home Sec. Only advantage wd. be to add penalties clause and so get them increased.

L. Ch. Dangerous: amdt wd. be put down.

Ch. Duchy. So it wd. – on 2 R – if we introduced Bill confined to penalties.

Home Sec. I will discuss with Iremonger possibility of adopting only “words inciting hatred”, if penalties can be added. I will take Att. Gen. with me.

P.M. Yes: force in Ch. Duchy‟s point. [Exit Att. Gen.

4. Agricultural Policy C (63) 65 &amp; 68.

P.M. Resume discussion. Objective to limit Exch. commitment by controlling domestic prodn and, therefore, imports. Basic principle for dom. prodn is to adopt standard quantities with subsidy tapering after ceiling. As regards imports, cereals to be regulated by minimum price; meat by attempt to get voluntary agreements in context of orderly intl marketing.

First Secy. Don‟t forget levy subsidy for wheat.

Ch. Exch. It affects consumer/Exch. relationship rather than home/import relationship. It must be examined carefully, since our incomes policy depends on price stability.

M.A.F.F. It wd. save £80m gross: but only £40m net after allowance for feeding stuffs. Effect on c/l wd. be 1d on loaf at maximum.

P.M. Confine decisions to those needed immediately for forthcoming intl talks. Therefore leave levy/subsidy open.

M.Def. Will these discussions give farmers chance to share in growth?

P.M. Yes:- i) at declining rate, by tapering subsidy.

ii) by periodical reviews at which expansion of market will be reallocated between domestic and oversea producers.

M. Def. We are bound to be liberal importers of grain. ?Compensate our farmers by giving them encouragement to grow more meat.

M.A.F.F. ? Effect on exports to Argentine. Effect of our proposals is inevitably to establish a stable level of domestic prodn: only way of meeting farmers‟ wish to enlarge quantity of prodn is to reallocate periodically shares of increase in demand.

M.Def. We cd. exploit our posn as large food importers for benefit of domestic prodn of meat.

L.Ch. And why shd. Argentine or Yugoslavia have any share of increase in demand?

P.M. Because our current agreements give them free entry – at least as regards N.Z.

P.B.T. And Yugoslavia is joining G.A.T.T. while Arge (and Y.) is important export market, where we have large credits outstanding. Our balance of trade with Y. may be adverse: but to seek bilateral b. of t. wd. merely restrict trade all round.

M.Def. But in these two cases we ought not to pursue our theoretical doctrines to extreme limits at cost of grave political difficulties with our own farmers.

Ch. Exch. If we openly discriminate against A. she will discriminate against us. Hence my opposition to meat quotas. We mustn‟t resile on G.A.T.T.

M. Def. Many Eur. Countries are members of G.A.T.T.; but they impose quotas.

P.B.T. But both A. &amp; Y. have accepted voluntary limitn this year. This is what we must try to prolong.

M/S F.O. I agree with M. Def. We shd. re-examine our assumptions about our agrl policy in relation to b/p.

First Secy. And we have somehow to reconcile stability of farm incomes with N.E.D.C. doctrine of growth of national income.

M/S. F.O. Hence importance of levy/subsidy for cereals, wh. helps both farmers and Exch.

Ch. Sec. At expense of consumer!

M/S. F.O. Who won‟t notice it any more than he did when we last did it.

Ch. Sec. And increased Family Allowances at same time!

P.M. We must settle levy/subsidy before announcing our policy as a whole. But for purposes of intl negotns only beef a real problem. Here we must work for some form of voluntary agreement to control imports wh. allows some element of growth to farmers and some chance of increasing domestic share of increase in market on review.

Our object is to limit Exch. commitment – not (as in report) to stabilise domestic prodn at present level. We have always got a Govt purchasing commission in reserve.

P.B.T. At cost of offending consumer, who will dislike standardised qualities etc.

P.M. But Socialist Govt. wd. introduce it. We can use this.

M.A.F.F. I will consult Ch. Exch. about a formula on our policy wh. Ministers might use in defending it in public. [Exit M/S. C.R.O.

5. Rates of Growth of Public Expenditure. C (63) 72.

Ch. Sec. As in memm and annex. For infmn at this stage. Expdre rising at rate wh. some people regard as dangerous if our reflationary policy succeeds.

M.H. 1) Housing excludes current expre of local authorities. In other blocks it is included. Comparison unfair

2) %age rate of increase depends on index of wages &amp; prices, wh. ought to be national index. But one sector may show bigger rise than another. Hence difficulty of translating growth in real terms into growth in money terms.

3) Pilot scheme on health has been based on 21/2%. But N.E.D.C. says 3.7% for health &amp; welfare. Therefore watch rates allotted to each block wh. cd. easily be unfair and be seen to be unfair if published.

L.Ch. Consider representation of legal block.

M.Tr. I support M.H. on disproportionate rise in trad costs.
