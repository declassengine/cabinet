C.C. (63) 23 4th April, 1963, 10.30.am

1. Chief Anthony Enahoro (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip: Att. Gen.

Home Sec. I still think it just to return him unless P.M.‟s pledge to House and subsequent enquiries cause me to change my mind.

Original legal doubt how alloyed (and, if valid, shd. have been raised by D. Foot before High Court). And all circuml evidence against presumption of fresh capital charges.

Att. Gen. Soskice agrees original doubt invalid.

Soskice still not wholly convinced about subsequent doubt: but I am, and am supported by N. Courts who ruled against similar point at close of prosecution case against Awolowo. Moreover, only procedure by jury can convict on capital charge: and jury is last thing N. Govt. want.

Under F.O. Act N. Govt can prefer new charge after E‟s return. But that has been true throughout.

Home Sec. And is improbable – given no capital charge against main offender, Awolowo. It wd. be a flagrant breach of faith.

Ch. Duchy. But we have known this all along – and yet made represn to N. Govt. as only means of satisfying H/C. Therefore we asked for two assurances – and we have not got them. Fact that N. Court itself rejected point may help and shd. be emphasised: but it is our only new defence.

P.M. Quoted original assurance to H/C. We are in the clear with H/C., since first doubt now decisively negated. Request for assurance of no fresh capital charge was a subsequent thought of our own, on wh. we are not committed to H/C. once original doubt disposed of.

L.Ch. Decision, after Courts have pronounced, rests not with H/C. or with Cabinet but with Home Sec‟s conscience.

Our approach to N. Govt. was made while original point was doubtful and was therefore based on possibility that d.p. might attach to second count. That is now disposed of. If so, we can‟t press request for assurance of no fresh cap. charge – given status and probity of N. judicial admn.

Ch. Whip. On this basis we can carry the House, tho‟ perhaps not with a large majority.

Best if Att. Gen. wd. make formal (3.30) statement on legal issues before debate.

M.H. I sympathise with Ch. Duchy. We did ask for assurance on no new cap. charge; and we were refused. And this may become known.

Moreover, difficult to revert to original posn in view of all the fuss and the lapse of time. Irrelevant: but politically valid.

Home Sec. I appreciate comparative aspect of lapse of time. But no new fact has emerged: and risk of new cap. ch. was not raised at Court hearing or in E‟s subsequent petition to me. It is a red herring introduced by H/C.

L. Ch. If lapse of time to be taken seriously, E. can apply for h. corpus. And precedent for even longer lapses of time. Not more than 7-8 weeks involved here.

M. Def. Initial and separate “statement” by Att. Gen. may provoke separate debate in wh. legal waters will be muddied again.

Ch. Whip. But tactically better to get this out of way before wider debate on broad issues.

[Exeunt Home Sec., Att. Gen.

2. Federation of Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland C (63) 58.

First Secy. Memm makes clear that, if Africans had voted, U.F.P. would have won and would have at least 15 B roll seats and perhaps 3 A roll as well – i.e. substantial African opposition.

New constn also pointed to A. majority in 15 years at outside and perhaps much sooner.

Constt therefore more progressive than supposed – and was so recognised by H/C. at the time.

Draft reply to Field circulated. Must concede (para 2) ultimate right of S. Rh. to attain indepce “through the normal processes”, as for N.Rh &amp; Ny. But this must await dissoln of Fedn since otherwise S. Rh. wd be indept member of non-indept Fedn. Nor cd. it be achieved by “temporary delegation” device. Therefore review pleas for further discussns before any changes are made: and indicate certain matters must be discussed before indepce can subsequently be granted. This cd. cover as much or as little as we wish.

W.F. has now publicly resnewed claim to indepce not later than date when N.Rh. and Ny. obtain indepce or secession. Reply can deal with this, if necy.

But doubtful whether reply will hold W.F. in any event. He may not wait until Fedn is dissolved; and he will want assurance – wh. we must give him – that in interim we will not interfere in S. Rh. internal affairs.

L.P.S. What do we hope to gain by this. Merely economic links between N. &amp; S. Rh.? Or real change of Govt. and constn in S. Rh? If no real hope of latter, we shall be badly placed.

First Secy. Not much hope of change of constn. Even Whitehead regards indepce as inevitable. Realistic course is to promote confce. for dissoln of Fedn and to deal with indepce afterwards.

But S. Rh. put indepce before link with N. Rh., since they intend thereafter to turn to Union for moral &amp; material supports. Is it our moral duty to try to dissuade them? Answer ambiguous: but I think we shd. try to maintain link with N. Rh.

L.Ch Amend to make “as soon as practicable” as expression of our intention as well as their wish. This may hold S. Rh., despite ambiguity of necessary changes before indepce.

? Insert – or make privately – some refce. to complication of membership of C‟wealth.

Ch. Duchy. Can any formula, however ingenious, paper over the real dilemma?

I cd. not at any time regard it as defensible to concede indepce to S. Rh. – wh. wd. be against all our policy and wd. produce a country ostracised by C‟wealth (wh. might split on this) and by U.N.

If we send this letter, we shd. clarify “a number of matters” to say specifically “constl changes”. But are we prepared to face this issue now: or shd. we defer it till autumn (when circumstances may be even more awkward).

L.P. Real issue is whether we give indepce or they take it. We can‟t give it unconditionally: and draft makes this clear. If they accept it, well &amp; good. If they react by taking indepce, our posn is defensible. Therefore send it.

M. Edn. I agree – as first step. We needn‟t do more at this stage.

First Secy. Com Sec. (absent) also wants to spell out “certain matters” to make clear that it means “constl changes”. Too dangerous: but cd. indicate need for constl confce. before indepce.

P.M. Our duty to Africans suggests deferring final crunch if possible.

Therefore still try to determine economic links first, as means of calming S. Rh. down and educating them in realities of transition to indepce. Therefore play it long – the more so since, if we act decisively now, we shall be left with all the odium, responsibility and cost of liquidating Fedn.

First Secy. W.F. has promised me, privately, that he will democratise the 15 African seats (even to extent of “one man, one vote”) after next election. But he won‟t go further; and he way therefore refuse to accept a reply wh. leaves undecided the question whether S. Rh. can obtain indepce on basis of present constn.

L.P.S. Cd. they be indept of U.K. while not indept of Fedn?

L. Ch. They wd. still be dept on U.K. to extent that Fedn will be dept on U.K.

P.M. And risk of African trouble might be even greater.

L.P.S. But U.N. (Ctee of 24 etc) won‟t let S. Rh. calm down in interim, as we hope. Tension will rise, not fall: and it will be concentrated not only on changing constn but also on not granting indepce. – particy if last para. of draft points to indepce not later than Ny. i.e. about next spring.

P.M. But wd. not confce. on economic links help to keep U.N. quiet?

L.P.S. But U.N. will press N. Rh. not to conclude ec. links until S. Rh. constn remedied.

M.H.L.G. Turn this round. Tell Kaunda that we want confce. on ec. links to save S. Rh. Africans from being subjected to Union.

First Secy. Yes. K not steamed up about S. Rh. indepce. And Nyerere wants it played long.

Ch. Duchy. Yes: but draft commits us to indepce by next Spring. We can‟t do that. Must insert Com. Sec‟s addn; and omit “to this end”.

P.M. But don‟t commit ourselves to conditions wh. we may not be able to enforce.

M. Def. In any case clarify para. 4.

M.A.F.F. So long as N. Rh. has not seceded, is second sentence of third para. really true?

First Secy. It means “fully indept,

M.A.F.F. Then last para evades ques. of indepce simultaneously with secession of N. Rh. &amp; Ny.

L.P. Yes – rightly. It concedes indepce wh. is practicable: it rejects (implicitly) secession, wh. is impracticable.

M.H. Omit para. 4. Reword “a number of constl and other matters”. Modify “to this end”.

P.M. “A number of matters – constl, financial, defence etc – wh. always arise in relation to the granting of indepce and [have to be provided for in] to the legn wh. has to be enacted by the U.K. Parlmt”. Omit “to this end” insert “recognise”.

First Secy. W.F. threatens to return on Monday. What about Parlt?

Ch. Duchy. Motion for Easter adjn on Tuesday. Enahoro statement on Wed. followed by Budget Resn, followed by main Enahoro debate (wh. may have to be given whole day). Must therefore avoid S. Rh. debate on Wed. – even at cost of Statement on Thursday, with promise of debate after Easter.

First Secy. I will tackle Dupont on this basis.

3. Parly Business (oral).

Ch. Duchy. As in statement.

4. Satellite Communications (oral). [Enter M. Avn: P.M.G.

L.P.S. Design study announced in debate.

Swiss have suggested tht political advisers shd. attend next technical confce.

We have replied by promoting our own view of subsequent political confce.

French have now anticipated this with similar, but earlier, confce, and have asked us to be co-sponsors. But we want it later, in London and with wider membership than C.E.P.T.

Stick to our own view. We know that Fr. are trying to wean us away from Five into bilateralism! We shd. resist this and rest on our announcement in H/C. and our own timetable &amp; venue. This doesn‟t preclude our receiving a Fr. technical mission.

M. Avn. I agree. But:-

a) We shan‟t get far without technical co-opn with Fr.

b) We shdn‟t commit ourselves to one system rather than two competve systems, albeit on complementary basis.

P.M. I agree. Watch the U.S. on b). This means bargaining hard on our real estate.

L.P.S. But Europe will react against us and towards U.S., if we give too much the impression of trying to “go it alone”.

5. Foreign Affairs (oral) [Exit P.B.T., M. Avn. P.M.G.

a) Laos.

L.P.S. We are co-operating with S.U. in trying to steady sitn in Laos after assassination.

b) Argentine.

Revolt being suppressed.

c) Iraq.

Iraqi Govt. wd. like us to train officers (to be withdrawn from S.U.) and to supply arms. Consider this urgently. Must try to bargain on posn of Kuwait also.

P.M. Training can‟t do any harm. Arms more debatable, if more internal upheavals possible.

d) Supply of large-diameter pipe to Soviet Union.

L.P.S. Leakage in Bonn about N.A.T.O. resn. This has lowered temperature and explained our posn to German public opinion.

U.S. have tried to pre-empt C. Durham output. But can‟t absorb it in full: and prices are 30% higher than German.

P.M. Let M. Power examine this.

6. South Africa and the United Nations C(63) 59.

P.M. Take note.
