C.C. (63) 30. 14 May 1963. 4 p.m. H/C.

1. India and Pakistan C(63) 82. [Enter C.D.S; S of S. Air:

Ch. Whip.

P.M. Circulate Kennedy‟s message.

Com. Sec. Kashmir &amp; aid: obvious link – diversion of resources. Hence U.S./U.K. pressure on K. issue – proposal for mediation now being considered by I. and P. Can‟t press link too far: must therefore consider further aid on merits. India impressed by our initial aid: a new U.K./I. relationship as result of our £20 m. (and U.S. £20 m.) agreed at Nassau. Also discussed there further aid:-

a) general equipment: understood something would be provided after military assessment of scale &amp; nature of threat.

b) Air defence: decided to send an A.D.M.: mentioned despatch of squadrons.

I. wants 3 f. squads = £85 m. and therefore not on. But any further aid must be used to woo them away from neutrality. Defence pact would be best – to close India/Burma gap. But not easy to bring I. into a pact, without P: defence of sub-continent must be indivisible. Also can‟t hurry India to change front too quickly. And U.S. anxious to avoid any new commitment wh. wd. involve Senate approval.

There remains “air umbrella”. This might involve war with China. But safest and best of courses open to us. I. won‟t go further in “alignment” at this stage: but this wd. commit them. Moreover, provided we retain control over use, we cd. not sit idle while Ch. overran I.; and we must therefore do something. Proposal is also effective deterrent.

Other aid shd. be kept to minimum while K. dispute continues – say £10-20 m. from U.S. and something comparable (? but less) from U.K.

Must be ready for discussns with Krishnamachairi and decide on reply to Kennedy, who will see him first.

P.M. Must consider: Kashmir: scale of renewed attack: I. resources to meet it: degree of U.S./U.K. help: “air umbrella”.

M. Def. Not a defence problem: a political issue. But don‟t drift into war with China. Clear difference between supply of equipment and loan of active squadrons.

C.D.S. U.S./U.K. assessment of India‟s needs much lower than India‟s. I therefore told India what she needed without overstraining economy (and without mentioning “air umbrella”). They accepted this; but they rely completely on us. New Ch. attack wd. probably be via Burma, who might let them through. On “air umbrella”, no question of forward use: wd. be restricted to defence of cities, freeing I.A.F. for attack.

F. Sec. Ch. unlikely to attack I.: more concerned with rectifying frontiers, especially in Ladakl. If they do, only after taking over Burma and all S. E. Asia. But attack via Burma, wh. wd. bring in E. Pakistan. Therefore defence of subcontinent is indivisible.

Valuable to bring I. over to West. But I. must decide this: and she shows no signs of doing so. Let her learn that no use in looking to Russia or trying to continue to play West off against Russia. Therefore content ourselves with modest supplies of equipment &amp; avoid “air umbrella”. Latter wd. involve accepting commitment to defend I. in total war. Withhold this until I. &amp; P. will make joint arrangements for defence of whole continent, wh. we &amp; U.S. might guarantee.

S. of S. Air. Our f. sqns. being reduced anyhow.

First Secy “Umbrella” – wh. wd. be commitment by us with no commitment by India – wd. prevent any success on Kashmir. Therefore confine to supplies of equipment i.e. final para. of Kennedy‟s letter.

Com. Sec. That is only spares for Hunter‟s and some training.

F. Sec. says India has no choice but to turn to West. May be true: but Nehru might prefer to accept risk of Ch. attack to eating his words to this extent. “Umbrella” wd. be his commitment: he can‟t thereafter not be aligned with West. But a pact wd. be premature: Nehru won‟t wear it – yet. Nor wd. U.S.

Ch. Sec. We have given £20 m. of defence aid and £50 m. in civil aid loans.

Another £10 m. defence aid wd. be the limit.

S. of S. Air Squadron wd. cost about £½ m. a year.

L. Ch. “Umbrella” is one-sided benefit to India. I agree with F. Sec.: we shdn‟t risk war with China.

L.P. It wd. be ineffective as a deterrent. Nor is that risk real. But I. needs to be jolted out of complacency.

Com. Sec. If we take an active part in defence of India, that will deter Ch. If we have got to defend I. anyhow in the last resort.

M.A.F.F. Little chance of real invasion of India – at least without involving E. Pak. Therefore what is at stake is defence of whole continent. Therefore get K. settlement.

M.H.L.G. I agree with F. Sec. But wd. U.S. go it alone?

Com. Sec. Yes.

Ch. Duchy Accept proposal, for sake of U.K./U.S. relations. Avoid incurring ill-will of both U.S. &amp; India.

P.M. Nice balance. If we must give more aid, “umbrella” is cheapest form. But political commitment – virtually to defend India at cost of war with China – v. doubtful. [Historical reminiscences: Asquith etc.] Respice finem, before you begin. True that if Ch. really tried to seize India &amp; S.E. Asia, U.S. wd. probably intervene – on largest scale. That is real deterrent to China. If we provide “umbrella”, we may merely provoke Chinese to renew attack before India is ready. Note Kennedy thinks of presenting as joint training missiles – i.e. training ourselves. This makes purpose quite clear. Suppose Ch. retaliates by seizing H.K.?

F. Sec. Ignoring Kashmir, let us &amp; U.S. propose to I. &amp; P. that they shd. form pact for defence of continent?

P.M. An error to try to commit the unaligned? An outdated legacy of Dulles? Better to try to get them to take devt aid than military aid? Arming may drive India into bankruptcy and therefore Communism. But why arm them for a war wh., if it happens, will be settled by U.S. nuclear capability. If we are involved in war with China, wd. not Russia move?

But can we offend U.S.? And P. wd. need squadrons less than any other form of aid to India.

Com. Sec. U.S. will do this. Can we afford to be left out?

M. Def. U.S. can‟t give any conventional aid to India. Therefore if “umbrella” is a commitment, it commits U.S. (and us) to nuclear intervention.

C.D.S. And I. may refuse “umbrella”. If so, we waste chance of cheap generosity!

Home Sec. Kennedy really trying to get round Congress, who wd. oppose any further aid to India without settlement on Kashmir. The risk is too great: remember the 1939 guarantee to Poland.

M. Edn Tell U.S. that we doubt “umbrella”s utility, on F. Sec.‟s lines: even tho‟ we don‟t want to link aid with Kashmir.

C.D.S. We can‟t afford to blackmail Nehru over Kashmir. It is only if he thought Ch. were really going to attack – and he doesn‟t – that he could be panicked into K. settlement.

P.M. Resume to-morrow.
