C.C. (63) 25 11 April 1963 10.30 a.m. H/C.

1. Foreign Affairs (oral). [Enter Ch.Whip.

a) Cuba.

F. Sec. Rusk told me (v. privately) that Cubans are being trained to use A.A. batteries which Russians are leaving behind. U.S. v. fussed about this: suspect R. may try to re-install missiles.

b) Malaya.

F. Sec. Tunku‟s discussion with Pres. of Philippines went well. Sukarno also prepared to meet him. Tension over Malaysia now reduced.

c) Laos.

F. Sec. We have backed neutralists: but they are too indolent and army gradually subverted by Communists. Rest may drift to Right and polarity re-established. Essential I.C.C. shd. assert authority in Plain of Jars. I have appealed to Russians for this purpose.

d) Japan.

F. Sec. Japs. want to be friendly and to have our sponsorship to join appropriate intl orgns. Ec. posn quite strong. We may pick up some addl trade.

e) Europe.

F. Sec. French may accept Schroder‟s plan for combining consultn between Permanent Repves in Brussels, provided it comprises our policies as well as E.E.C.‟s.

Italians still hope to arrange W.E.U. meeting in June.

2. Exports of arms to Iraq. (oral)

Ch. Sec. S.E. Cttee favour meeting Iraqi requests. Overtaken by to-day‟s announcement of new U.A.R.

F. Sec. Must reconsider and ascertain how valid new U.A.R. is.

P.M. Accept exports in principle: but defer implementn until F. Sec. has reconsidered. Meanwhile pursue admve implicns of granting requests.

F. Sec. Bunter ascertained that Egypt wd. begin to withdraw 15 days after satisfy agt with S.A: but they wd. leave enough troops to maintain republn Govt.

3. Export of Large Diameter Steel Pipe. C.(63) 60.

[Enter M. Power.

F. Sec. I made our posn clear to Schroeder, who accepted it but still hoped to avoid a row, resulting from failure to understand our reservation to N.A.T.O. Decision.

P.B.T. U.S. order unlikely to materialise on adequate scale. S.D. therefore likely to pursue negotns with S.U: and we can‟t discourage them.

M. Power Neither Shell nor B.P. want to accept U.S. pre-emptive offer: we shouldn‟t encourage them to.

L.P.S. But Shell don‟t want Russian oil in Europe.

F. Sec. And U.S. Govt. genuinely believe in strategic argument.

L.P.S. Our prohibn cd. extend to Part I (without Parly action)? Or would firm merely sell via third parties.

L.P. But this wd. be inconsistent with our assertion that we can‟t act without Parly action.

P.M. We can‟t intervene. But need we make a Statement?

Ch. Exch. Can‟t we get a U.S. order? Infinitely preferable.

M. Power. But that wd. simply mean that Russian order might be taken by other capacity. V. unfair to S.D.

F. Sec. ? Tell U.S. that, if they are in earnest about pre-emption, they must act quickly.

M. Power. But avoid any undertaking to refrain from taking S.U. orders at all.

F. Sec. German reaction will be sharp: but Schroeder understands the realities of the sitn.

P.M. Produce formula for use when order is booked. [Exit Com. Sec.

4. U.K. Fishery Limits. (oral). [Enter Att. Gen.

L. Ch. Reminded of earlier decision. Latest devt on Faroes – a unilateral act. We may challenge in Intl Court. If so:-

a) watch Anglo-Danish relations.

b) we cd. lose if Danes extended limits of terrl sea. So bad a

precedent that must pin Danes to 3 mile limit for terrl sea.

These issues need further considn. But if we won, we shd. not need to extend our own limits, while if we lost we shd. Can‟t wait two years. Must therefore give notice before 15 May, even though

time for consultn v. short. We shd. also say amount of extension – subject to M.A.F.F.‟s counter plea. But bluff of 12 miles valid only if terrl sea extended by same amount: v. damaging qua defence policy. Possible compromise. Whatever the decision, can‟t risk a further year‟s delay.

Home Secy. If consultns, I must inform Ch. I.‟s this morning.

M.A.F.F. Deep sea f‟men. don‟t oppose extension, but wd. like postponement of announcement for 6 months, in order to secure E.F.T.A. entry into E.E.C. Inshore f‟men. understand this, though they want early action and early announcement of our intentions.

S. of S. Scot. Scots won‟t accept a delay wh. wd. be, in effect, 18 months not 6.

L.P. Notice of terminn wdn‟t necessarily wreck E.E.C./E.F.T.A. Confce. It provides addl incentive: and we can always change our minds.

M.A.F.F. No: it wd be bad beginning for Confce.

L.P.S. But interval for consultn now v. short.

M. Def. Defence arg. is for 3 miles. At least don‟t go to 6 for fishery with same limit for terrl sea. Better to have 3 &amp; 9.

L. Ch. But beware of giving Danes a new line of argt.

S. of S. Scot. Essential thing is to satisfy our fishermen by action – i.e. by termination, wh. doesn‟t necy commit us to doing anything.

L. Ch. And it doesn‟t shut door on E.E.C./E.F.T.A. agreement.

M.A.F.F. Then say denounce: but leave extent of enlargement open and if this complicates terrl limits, we cd. remedy this to some extent by taking Faroes to Intl Court.

L. Ch. That wd. take 3 years! We can‟t leave extent vague: and if people think we have 12 in mind, everybody will assume this means 12, wh. is disastrous for defence. Therefore adopt my compromise – say 6 from May ‟64 with reservn about terrl waters in light of Intl Court.

F. Sec. Period for consultn now v. short.

L. Ch. It was recognised as such at last Cab. And we now have longer than we then thought.

L.P.S. But risk of great damage to our Eurn relations: and our legal posn with France is not clear and may be challenged in Intl Court. Notice

now wd. negate all our efforts to build up Eurn co-opn. Therefore try for E.E.C./E.F.T.A. Confce if we fail, give notice in May ‟64.

L. Ch. But why waste a year? Give notice now and consult during the year.

S. of S. Scot. I agree.

M.A.F.F. But if Confce succeeded – and it cdn‟t from point of view of inshore

f‟men. – cd. we then decide not to extend limits?

L. Ch. Only French wd. be difficult legally: and discussn on fishing limits in N. Sea is distinct from admission of E.F.T.A. fish to E.E.C.

M.A.F.F. If compromise wd. prevent Confce, v. serious, since confce essential to health of our fishing fleet as a whole. We want freer trade in fish in Europe. France doesn‟t want this. Our only weapon is threat to extend our own limits. If we announce extension to 6 and say nothing about 12, we have lost our bargaining counter.

L.P. But Fr. will take us to Intl Court on 1843 Regns in any case. And since this issue is subsumed in larger issue of fishing limits, it isn‟t a valid excuse for delay.

M.A.F.F. I assume we shd. win at Intl Court.! Otherwise no point in denunciation.

L.P. But Fr. are going to stick to 3 miles for at least 3 years (i.e. time of Intl Court‟s hearing). No sense in view that we can buy them off by a conference.

First Secy How important is confce?

L.P.S. It will demonstrate our intention to try to work with Europe. But impossible to say whether we can get confce, whether or not we give notice or whether, if we get it, it will secure E.F.T.A. entry into E.E.C.

P.M. Give notice now, leaving extension vague, and trying to negotiate in interval.

L. Ch. V. well. But we must be ready to act (with legve authy) by date of expiry of notice. Therefore confce must be as early and rapid as possible.

5. Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (oral).

First Secy S. Rh. Govt. meeting to-day and will probably make Statement.

Their reply to our letter may arrive next week. It will probably reject it as too vague, and ask for confce in May on full indepce. Or they may assert indepce unilaterally.

L. Ch. Becoming more urgent to destroy Fedn.

First Secy R.W. wd. oppose. My tactics must be to keep R.W. &amp; W.F. apart and to try to get links Confce first.

M. Edn Has W.F. really counted intl &amp; economic implications of Boston tea party, e.g. on tobacco prefce?

L. Ch. I will discuss draft Bill with First Secy.

First Secy We want a different Bill – for Nyasaland anyhow and now probably for other two Territories.

M. Lab. What does moderate opinion in S. Rh. feel? ? Consult Grenfell, Prain etc.

M.H.L.G. ? And give a public warning to both races about danger of impulsive action.

Ch. Secy It might be counterproductive.

M. Tr. Limit it to purely factual statement e.g. responsible newspaper article.

First Secy Effect wd. be v. ephemeral.

Ch. Exch. Crux will be safeguards of minority to be incorporated in any new Constn.

M.A.F.F. S. Rh. may go some way as Union – i.e. not conceding even small amdts. We ought to find some way of influencing responsible opinion in S. Rh. in interval before Confce in May.

P.M. Work through companies with commercial interests in N &amp;.S Rhodesia.

First Secy May be too slow in taking effect.

Ch. Exch. But they might listen to big buyers of tobacco?

P.T.B. And have they faced intl ostracism, both politically and credit-wise?
