C.C. (63) 19 28 March 1963, 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral) [Enter Ch.Whip: Att.Gen

Ch.Duchy. As in statement.

2. Federation of Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland. (oral)

First Secy No identity of view among delegns. Circulate statement. Do we accept N. Rh. claim to secede: or not? They threaten civil disobedience and refusal to attend Confce., if not. R.W. won‟t attend if secession conceded in advance: and will react violently – tho‟ not by force. S. Rh. very elusive: wants us to accept odium of granting secession to N. Rh. and wants more money from us. Jittery about independence. Unstable &amp; unpredictable: may refuse, under R.W.‟s pressure, to attend confce.

Only altve to accepting secession for N. Rh. is to contemplate confce. with only Fedl &amp; S. Rh. Govts (nonsense) and waiting on developments. This would avoid row with R.W.: but wd. have little other advantage – except perhaps to prevent S. Rh. from drifting nearer to Union.

Ch.Duchy. Moment of choice has arrived. Must accept that N. Rh. will soon have to be granted what Nyd has already got. Therefore make statement as clear, in this sense, as possible.

L. Ch. We have hitherto refused to accept preconditions of attendance. We shd. stick to this, but admit possibility of secession by individual territories.

L.P. Must ultimately accept N. Rh. secession: but premature before some public confrontation.

L.P.S. Have we exhausted possibilities of confrontation to persuade parties that Fedn can‟t go on? Draft implicitly assumes this: but is it so?

Ch.Exch. No progress until we accept N. Rh. right to secede. The sooner the better.

Ch.Secy I agree.

M.Edn So do I. We cd. let Nyd- go without raising major issue: we can‟t in case of N. Rh. But we must still concede it – as precondition of building new Central Africa.

M.Lab. But this may prevent Confce. with either Fedl or S. Rh. Govts present.

M. Trans. I agree with Ch. Exch.

M.Def. So do I.

M.H.L.G. Deal with Kaunda while we can. He may be followed by something worse?

M.A.F.F. Fedl Govt. bound to disappear soon: therefore deal with N. &amp; S. Rh. on their terms.

Com.Sec. Fedn dead: only problem is how to bury it. R.W. unlikely to resort to military force. N. Rh. will secede de facto, whatever we do: and this will wreck Fedl authority over a large area. But, if granted secession, they might form economic link with S. Rh., despite Field‟s reactionary politics. Therefore must jettison R.W. (But watch precedent for Somalis in Kenya.)

M.Health. Now a question only of tactics and timing. I agree with L. Ch. rather than Ch. Exch. If we concede N. Rh. secession now, there is no point in a confce. or in discussing new links until we have legislated to dissolve Fedn. But this would be premature. Therefore accept draft – i.e. accept incompatibilities as facts of situation.

M.W.P. Fedn now a sham: sooner we accept this the better, even if R.W. refuses to attend Confce. At least we can then go ahead with what matters, i.e. forming new links.

P.B.T. I agree.

P.M. Kaunda says he can‟t return without secession conceded. If so, we must either concede it (and legislate quickly for liquidation of Fedn) or try – at considerable risk – to fluff it as in my draft.

Only advantage of Field is that he wants to dissolve Fedn: and for moment is acceptable to N. Rh. But he will cease to be so, as soon as Fedn is dissolved. Field is also dependent on R.W., in sense of depending on same electorate. Therefore he wants us to accept odium of decision. In once sense R.W. has moved more readily than anybody else; but secession wd. be difficult for him.

? Best to say we recognise territories can‟t be held against their will.

L.Ch. Read new draft.

Com.Sec. Add a preamble stressing that we have repeatedly made it clear that Fedn wd. not work without consent of Territories.

First Secy This means that R.W. will refuse to attend Confce. He may also organise referendum or election; but probably – in his present mood – nothing more.

M.Def. If he resorts to force, we can‟t resist.

First Secy He has told me that he won‟t, in order to impose a political decision: but will in order to maintain law &amp; order in N. Rh.

Ch.Whip. Party accept Fedn dead: but some sentimental support. If we fail to get a Confce., blame must lie with Kaunda rather than Field. Therefore L. Ch.‟s draft may go too far from this point of view.

P.M. We must grasp nettle: N. Rh.‟s claim to right of secession can‟t be denied. Public presentation needs further thought.

Com. Sec. New draft of introductory passage.

M.Def. No: reserve our apologia for development later.

P.M. Must accept that N. Rh.‟s claim cannot be denied. But must emphasise advantages of some assocn and need for proper transl arrangements, so protecting ourselves against need for early legn. First Secy to draft final text. ? adopt some form of words as in case of Nyd. [Enter Home Secy Issue Statement to Press at 6 p.m. to-morrow, with Statement in Parlt on Monday.

Will assist First Secy, with L.Ch. &amp; M.W.P. with final text.

Must do all we can to make Kaunda say that he will now attend Confce. to discuss future assocn.

3. Chief Anthony Enahoro (oral).

Home Sec. P.M. has asked Ambassador for undertakings that (i) E. will not be tried on capital charge. (ii) N. Att. Gen. will not proceed with charge to wh. death penalty attaches. (iii) If E. returned, no new charge carrying death penalty will be preferred against him.

A. has replied that none of charges carries death penalty: but will not give undertakings on (ii) &amp; (iii). None of others implicated in plot is at risk of life.

Com.Sec. Have spoken to High Cmr by telephone. Considerable popular feeling in Nigeria about dictation by H/C: undertaking (iii) thought to be very undignified.

Att.Gen. Undertaking (ii): am satisfied that second count, as now stands, wd. not carry death penalty. But N. Att. Gen. shd. concur. If so, no reason to withdraw it. But risk (iii) wd. remain: and even if undertaking wd. be undignified, N. Govt. shd. make point clear. Otherwise Home Sec.‟s position v. difficult.

L.Ch. But they have said that E. won‟t be executed. Can we decently go further?

Att.Gen. Soskice &amp; Foot incline to my view on (ii) but won‟t commit themselves.

Com.Sec. When Awolowo was tried, his counsel said second charge might involve death penalty. Both prosecution and judge denied this.

Att.Gen. But only on procedural grounds – because he was being tried by judge alone, whereas death penalty requires judge &amp; jury.

Ch.Duchy. And feeling in Parlt is such that E. can‟t be returned unless second charge is withdrawn.

Home Sec. And change of heart by N. on (iii) is real risk: my own conscience requires an undertaking on this point.

Com.Sec. But it doesn‟t arise out of Parly rumpus. It‟s an afterthought, wh. we can‟t ask for without accusing N. Govt. of bad faith. Precedent for future F.O. Act cases.

L.P. Undertakings are only relevant if charges do carry d.p. A.‟s reply says that they don‟t. Therefore cadit quaestio.

P.M. But still the risk of subsequent and different charge carrying d.p. H/C. will expect assurance on this too. It may be a separate point: but I inserted it in my Statement.

Att.Gen. I agree. N. Govt. cd. surely say that – as they have told us – they do not intend to add new charges.

Home Sec. I wd. be satisfied if (on assumption of independence of N. Courts) N. Att. Gen. made statement to this effect.

P.M. But wd. this satisfy H/C., if N. Govt. did not endorse it?

Home Sec. I don‟t insist on an undertaking by Govt. Statement by N. Att. Genl. that existing charges don‟t carry d.p. and that no new charges of that kind will be preferred, that will suffice. Otherwise I cannot return E.

Ch. Whip. Party v. uneasy. Debate left unfinished; but cannot be resumed until

10 April. This is true even if Att.Gen. of N. gave undertaking, since Oppn may challenge view that d.p. does not attach to second count of charge.

L.Ch. If so, we can only say that we draw inevitable inference from refusal of undertakings and will therefore not return him. But a pity if assurance by N. Att.Gen. might suffice.

P.M. Clear that F.O. Act must now be revised. If N. Att.Gen.‟s assurance wd. satisfy our Party, try to get it. But if not, don‟t try.

Ch.Duchy. In view of mood of Party, we must leave no shadow of doubt; and if N. Govt. will not give necessary undertakings we should not send E. back.

L.P. Dangerous precedent for future extradition cases.

P.M. Say that Home Sec.‟s decision based on assumption d.p. not involved. This now questioned (altho‟ in no previous stage of legal proceedings) on one count. Have therefore asked N. Govt. for undertaking d.p. not involved either on second count or on any other charge. They can‟t give this consistently with their dignity. But Home Sec. can‟t then send E. back.

Com.Sec. But the points are unrelated; nor has Awolowo, main offender, been charged with treason.

Ch.Duchy. Not in minds of Party.

Com.Sec. But we shouldn‟t deal with Australia like this: nor would Menzies dream of giving an assurance.

P.M. For our purpose N. Govt. is N. Att.Gen. If he will give assurance, then Home Sec. can let E. go.

Ch.Whip. But Party‟s confidence won‟t be restored: and our majority will be too low. For this reason, better not to seek assurances.

L.P. Even at risk of destroying confidence with Nigeria? There are no real grounds for impugning standards of their judicial procedure.

P.M. Try to get agreement with Soskice on existing charge. If so, and if N. Att.Gen. will give assurance on new charges, we must try to get away with it in Parlt, even at risk of small majority. But don‟t tackle new charges until we know whether Soskice agrees on existing charges.

Ch.Duchy. V. unhappy, personally as well as politically. We are playing a cat and mouse game with E.
