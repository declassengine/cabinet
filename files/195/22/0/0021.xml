C.C. (63) 21 1st April, 1963 6.pm H/C.

1. Federation of Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip

First Secy. Circulated Field‟s letter. Ny. secession effective towards end of year.

But is S. Rh. indepce linked with secession or indepce? Originally he claimed latter: now the former. F. pressing for immediate reply.

My statement in H/C this afternoon fairly well received. But pressure may develop for grant of indepce to S. Rh. and for deferment of indepce for both N. &amp; S. Rh. until fully representative institns created in both Territories. But former view predominant.

Args. in favour:

a) S. Rh. has had effective internal self govt for 40 years. Ny. only one year.

b) If Fedn not created, S. Rh. wd. have been indept by 1955.

c) Refusal may throw S. Rh. into arms of Union.

d) We have little power externally: none internally.

e) F. will refuse to attend confce. – which delays progress and formulation of transitional arrangements.

Args. against.

a) Impact on C‟wealth.

b) Impact on foreign opinion: U.N.

c) On moral liability.

We cd. say that our statement – “against its will etc” – opens way to indepce: but cannot proceed until links with other Terrs. dissolved (i.e. indepce within a non-indept Fedn a nonsence) therefore indepce on Ny. secession impossible. Therefore can only grant indepce when Fedn dissolved.

We cd. concede this in principle, reserving timing etc. for further discussion.

Alternatively, refuse to take decision until specified date, wh. wd. then be date of Ny. secession. Less attractive to F., who wants a decision now, as condition of attending confce.

Best therefore to keap all 3 Terrs. abreast, conceding S. Rh. indepce on dissolution of Fedn.

Com. Secy Problem is not timing (F. will accept any reasonable date) but conditions – i.e. ordinary process to indepce, wh. means revision of constn (at a constl confce. to which all parties are invited). No hope of agreement in S. Rh. on this.

Ch. Duchy Can‟t concede indepce in principle to F‟s Govt. therefore any formula must be accepted by F. as implying v. large constl changes before indepce effective.

Ch. Exch. Even while they are dependent, we can‟t help Africans. A sham to pretend we can help them any more by conceding indepce

L.P.B. Strong reaction from U.N. and other African states. Position like Union.

L.Ch. Can‟t grant indepce while still a Fedn. Make this clear. Thereafter recognise reality that S. Rh. almost indept now. We have no power to compel them to change constn. Therefore I support First Secy.

L.P. Choice is between letting S. Rh. take indepce and giving it to them. Both unpleasant: former risks, while latter avoids, Boston tea party.

M. Def. I support First Secy. They are going to become indept: better to give it to them in context of arrangements for dissoln of Fedn.

M. Edn. To grant indepce will be misunderstood by young voters. Must therefore stress circs. as well as timing, even tho‟ change of circs. v. unlikely.

Home Sec. Since F. can‟t have indepce without dissoln of Fedn. this will be an incentive to him to co-operate in that process. Therefore accept First Secy‟s proposal – but don‟t overstress circs. to extent of deluding our supporters.

M.A.F.F. Either we give it or they take it.

P.B.T Ny. is pace setter. We can‟t do less for either N. or S. Rh. even at expense of S. Rh. Africans.

S. of S.Scot Then they will move towards Union.

M.W.P. I agree on realities: but public opinion will not accept it unless we try to persuade F. to amend constn. This thought must figure in any statement of policy.

M.K. I support Ch. Duchy. We can‟t grant indepce to this Govt. Better not even to hint at conditions: simply say indepce cannot be considered until after secession. If F. then assumes indepce, so much the better for us.

First Secy. No: too embarrassing politically at home.

Ch. Duchy. We can‟t grant indepce to S. Rh. without wrecking C‟wealth. But not insoluble, given time. Therefore play for time on M.H lines: i.e. first, dissoln of Fedn: then secession: then consider applicns for indepce.

Com. Secy. And don‟t bless something we don‟t approve.

M. Def. But then we go on slipping until S. Rh. drifts into Union and our Party is increasingly discontented.

P.M. Defer decision for further reflection. Our interest is to dissolve Fedn on basis wh. holds hope for the future for peoples of C. Africa. Public opinion has endorsed this: and we must therefore continue to stage a confce. Orderly distribn of public debt particularly important for us – and for S. Rh‟s future credit worthiness.

Coup d‟état possible: but opinion in S. Rh. probably opposed to this except in last resort. Nor are they wholly happy about Union.

Where we have granted indepce, we have virtually abandoned white popn. But most have been traders: in S. Rh. they are settlers. In Algeria, Fr, settlers have abandoned their assets and gone.

The whites in N. Rh. also need consideration. But if so, Africans in S. R. also deserve considn.

Opinion in UK will be divided on obvious lines. Even if we can‟t enforce our will, shd. we try to improve constn before we leave?

In short, how can we promote the confce; how can we secure “rights” of European &amp; African respectively; how can we discharge our moral duty? Best by getting agreement if we can, on method of dissolving Fedn – wh. is as much in S. Rh. interest (for economic reasons) as in ours. Will S. Rh. really insist on indepce as a precondition of attending confce. for this purpose?

If so, let them go and try to arrange confce. afterwards. If not, we shd. try to arrange confce. first. Can we find a form of words wh. wd. bring them to the confce. while preserving our moral posn?

First Secy. We have gravely offended white popn already. I must do something to win them back, particularly since they have lot of support from our own back benches.

Com. Secy. Kaunda won‟t attend confce. now that S. Rh. have imprisoned Nkomo.

M.A.F.F. Nor if we have first conceded indepce in principle to S. Rh.

First Secy. But we can‟t abandon our own people. A concession to Africans must be matched by some concession to Europeans. Otherwise I can‟t carry on.

M. Edn. But if this means granting indepce on basis of present constn, we couldn‟t defend that to public opinion.

First Secy. Then S. Rh. will declare itself indept, and political effects here – and in C‟wealth – cd. be severe.

M. Edn. But less grave than political risk of granting indepce on basis of present constn.

Ch. Sec. I agree.

M.H. So do I.

Ch. Whip. Party have accepted disoln of Fedn. Therefore we must pay some price to get confce. on economic links on its feet.

If S. Rh. assured indepce, political reaction v. severe: our policy towards Africans wd. be said to have gone too fast.
