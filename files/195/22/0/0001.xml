C.C.(63)1. 3 January 1963. 10.45 a.m.

1. Secy. of Cabinet. [Enter Ch. Whip &amp; Sir N.B.

P.M Hail (after recovery from illness) and farewell (at end of long and distinguished career). Both official adviser and personal friend to Ministers – over whole field of administration.

Thank v. warmly on behalf of previous Govts : wish long and happy retirement.

Sir N.B. Thank P.M. for remarks.

“ all Ministers (of all Administrations) for kindness and consideration in the past.

Without compromising political virginity, wish Govt. good luck in ‟63.

[Exit Sir N.B.

2. Pensions and Natl. Insurance. (C.(62)209. [Enter M.P.N.I.

S of S Scot.

Ch.Exch. Must legislate, and pay benefits, as quickly as possible.

Main issue – flat or differential. If flat 7/6 simple; if diffl. 6/- to o/c 70 and 12/6 thereafter. Similar diffl. for N. Assce. Arguments as in memo : personally favour flat, since diffl. wd. have repercussions wh. can‟t be foreseen and might prejudice better diffl. scheme later.

Some sort of review inevitable.

Financing as in memo.

M.P.N.I. Flat rate increase wd. be in line with pensions increases since ‟52; and payment wd. be earlier.

Case for diffl. are stronger : but wd. be more controversial and legisln. more difficult. Wd. be criticised by unemployed and by sick under 70‟s. Wd. cost more : and contribns review would be higher unemployment sitn. : need for comprehensive review of natl. insurance system : Natl. Assce. differential even more difficult than N.I. diffl. – these three args. against diff-l. are conclusive.

Ch.Duchy. Favour diffl. Accepted Party Confce. motion for selectivity over a year ago, Current Party opinion is the same. Flat rate will therefore be controversial in own Party : and in line with our attitude at ‟59 Election. Age 70 shd. be recognised as a (political) watershed.

If arguments are evenly balanced choose the new and original course. Easiest to defeat Lipton‟s Bill, wh. will not be easily defeated by our own proposals on widowed mothers.

Merits of case reinforce political considns.

L.P. A man should save (in conditions of full emplt.) for after 70.

Post ‟70 provision unrelated to need is wrong : and if it operates against unemployed, is politically faulty.

Home Sec. I agreed originally with Ch. Duchy : but diminution in rate for unemployed (and 65-70‟s) is politically decisive against diffl.

Ch.Sec. Even 6/= wd. be more than required by C/L. increase. But I favour diffl. partly to meet political need for original step and partly to cater for the really old (i.e. over 70.‟s).

Recent public service (P.I.) Act gave 7/6 to over 70‟s : and some lessining in war pensions. Age 70 is a watershed in social sense; and some sort of “comforts allce.” is justified.

Some degree of discretion already in N. Assce. – for blind I.B. etc; therefore it is objn. not decisive.

M.Lab. No case for helping the non sick over 70.‟s. Discrim. in their favour against unemployed wd. be politically wrong. Therefore adopt flat increase. Need for review of N. Insce. from point of view of unempt. benefit; diffl. scheme now would prejudice this. But public enquiry dangerous : announce we are doing it ourselves.

M.Health. We can‟t defend only 6/= for all under 70‟s.

N. Assce. considers individual need : not compatible with indiscriminate provision for addition over 70. This is not selectivity as Party wants it.

Public enquiry on limited and defined points useful; but at large v. dangerous.

Financing needs to be further reviewed in light of impact on graduated scheme.

M.Transp. Agree with M. Health. Criticism will be not ltd. Over 70‟s. shd. not have extra, but ltd. needy under 70‟s shd. have it too.

M.w‟out P. No serious social research in favour of extra for over 70‟s.

M.Edn. I agree. Under 70 widows are particularly in need.

Ch.Sec. But we all agree ltd. widow with chn. shd. go up from 7/6 to 10/=.

L.Ch. No political gain in diffl. if at expense of unemployed. It wd. be a disincentive to keep old people at work : and it wd. prejudice enquiry into proper basis of differentiation.

L.P.S. I agree on disincentive : we need to consider principle of diffl. in relation to social and employment policies.

E.E.C. are considering these issues : we shd. defer decision on diffl. (with consequential impact on industrial costs) until we know whether we are going into Community or not.

Ch.Whip. Must accept flat increase. But Party will regard it as unoriginal and defeat of Lipton‟s Bill will be more difficult. If we fail on 2R, this will

not be easy.

P.M. Cd. we adopt Lipton‟s proposals?

M.P.N.I. No : repercussions wd. be too dangerous.

P.M. An original and novel scheme wd. be desirable. But past flat rate increases have always kept abreast of C/L : and good case for continuing on this line.

Selectivity shd. mean greater adaptation to need, regardless of age. Automatic increase at age 70 not really defensible.

Need shd. be catered for by N. Assce. on individual basis; and reluctance to claim N. Assce. shd. gradually die away.

Flat rate gives unemployed 7/6 rather than 6/- : that is critical point. And if 6/-, can we hold it against pressure?

Moreover, difft. if extended to N. Assce., transforms the scheme from discriminatory supplementation to additional automatic pension.

? adopt flat rate at 10/-.

M.P.N.I. £220 m. net. £39 m. from Exch. (£33 m. at 7/6-) and an extra 5d. (=½) on contribns. (9d. a side at 7/6).

M.Health. But adjustment of stamp wd. be unwelcome to employers, particularly in relation to graduated scheme.

P.M. That point shd. be settled by Cttee. who shd. re-examine method of financing.

But wd. 6/- last for rest of Parlt?

L.P. Unlikely.

Ch.Sec. Adopt flat increase, but take powers in Bill to introduce diffl. scheme if further studies justify it.

N.B. – retirement pensions number abouty 5½ m. : unemployed are much fewer.

P.M. If 10/- flat, what stamp?

M.P.N.I. ½ a side extra. £226 m. : £6 m. saving on N.A. = £220 m. of which £39 m. Exch.

Ch.Sec. Too much to compensate for 10/- rather than 7/6, particularly when unemplt. is reducing earnings.

But 5/- (instead of 4/-) on N. Assce.?

Ch.Exch. Consider this : it isn‟t in the Bill.

Ch.Sec. N.B. Timing of operation precludes acceptance of any amdt. of Bill if new unemplt. benefit to operate in March.

L.P. Advantage in that.

Ch.Duchy. But unemplt. is transitory. At time of Election the old will be more important than the unempd. Hence importance of diffl.

Ch.Sec. But we can‟t now put old before unempd.

Ch.Duchy. You only feel this because we are in winter and unempt. is high.

Both features will pass.

Ch.Sec. But we cd. never withstand pressure for all increases to be raised to 12/6.

M.P.N.I. Ch.man of Assce. Bd. has recommended – on personal basis – a diffl. of 10/- for over 70‟s under N. Assce.

P.M. Basic statistics:

a) Present employee contribn. 10/7 (incl. N.H. contribn.) at minimum.

b) 7/6 flat increase extra 9d.

Exch. + £33 m. (assuming 4/- increase in N. Assce.)

c) 10/- flat increase extra ½d.

Exch. + £39 m. (assuming 6/- increase in N. Assce.)

d) diffl. scheme : extra 11d. or 1/-.

Exch. + £39 m.

Ch.Exch. It wd. become clear that this wd. be the wrong sort of diffl.

As between 7/6 and 10/- flat, if extra cost for Exch. (allowing for war pensions) is small – and this must be verified – decision turns on political acceptability of increase in stamp.

P.M. First decide whether to differentiate or not. If not, then decide whether flat increase shd. be 7/6 or 10/-.

Balance of Cabinet view is against diffl.

On flat rate, M.P.N.I. to give Ch. Exch. comparative costs of 7/6 and 10/- increases, both to Exch. and to contributor. Then put to Cab. memo. on implications of both schemes, without any further adjustment of graduated pension scheme than is already envisaged. But Ch. Exch. M.P.N.I. and I will first discuss.

3. South African Arms Technicians. (C(62)210).

Ch.Sec. As in memo. Technicians to follow equipment authorised last year.

My committee recommend approval. B.S.A. wd. like official guidance.

P.M. We can‟t stop them. But express consent carefully – Govt. see no
