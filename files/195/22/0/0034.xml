C.C. (63) 34 23 May 1963. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip: M/S.

F.O.

Ch. Duchy As in statement. Whitsun recess.

2. Foreign Affairs (oral).

a. Africa.

M/S. F.O. Confce at A. Ababa will produce resolutions on Portugal &amp; S. Rh. unhelpful to us.

b. Turkey.

Abortive military coup last week. Martial law in main towns. Unfortunate in so far as exacerbates internal feeling.

c. Indonesia.

Sukamo‟s decree expropriating U.S. &amp; U.K. oil companies. Both of us are making representations: U.S. threatening end of aid. S. not prepared to relax decree but prepared to discuss.

d. S. Arabia.

Agreed to provide officers for White Army. Costs nothing and reinforces regime.

3. Nuclear Tests (oral).

P.M. See K.‟s reply (circulated) – not wholly discouraging.

See draft of further message to K.: Kennedy‟s comments expected in next day or two. Must announce before Whitsun, if possible. But watch timing in relation to K.‟s coming meeting with Chinese: he may need to demonstrate that his policy towards the West bears fruit.

4. N.A.T.O. Nuclear Force (oral).

P.M. Kennedy‟s request for U.K. participation in m-m. force. Goes further than our commitment at Nassau. Multinational force makes sense; m-m. force more doubtful. We must bless it in principle: but stall till clearer. Meanwhile Cabinet not committed to participate.

M/S. F.O. N.A.T.O. meeting at Ottawa have just agreed time not yet ripe for detailed discussion of this project.

5. Public Order. C(63) 88. [Enter Att. Gen.

H. Sec. As in memom. Oppn to proposed amdt – a limitation of free speech (e.g. wd. make it impossible to say hospitals o‟crowded because illegitimacy rate among W. Indies high). Therefore revert to Bill merely increasing penalties – as soon as possible, to anticipate criticism if further troubles.

Ch. Duchy Do both, if necy in separate Bills. Desirable to amend S.5; don‟t yield to few vociferous back benchers.

Private Bill this Session not a starter: nor a controversial Govt. Bill at this stage in Session. But let statement indicate intention to amend S.5. next Session.

L. Ch. I now think it right to amend S.5. Therefore do both this Session.

L. P. I agree – if we do it at all. But why add anything at all? Present law adequate.

Home Sec. Cmnr of Police says admdt will do nothing to strengthen his existing powers.

Att. Gen. It may marginally increase the law‟s power to restrict freedom of speech. But it won‟t so operate v. often.

L. Ch. If we amend S.5., this is all we can do. But, if so, do it now, with penalties.

M.H. On timing I agree with L. Ch.

On substance, if words are otiose, no point in it. If they really add something to law, Att. Gen.‟s view a clear warning. Therefore leave it alone.

Ch. Sec. I agree. If we amend at all, go whole hog and insert “racial”. But better to do nothing.

First Secy ? Make statement as proposed, suspending judgment on amdt. of S.5.

Ch. Duchy But this is what I opposed last time: Cab. then agreed to amend S.5.: why now concede to Bill? It wd lose us rest of Iremonger.

First Secy As ex H. S., I wd. oppose amdt. But I wd. leave posn open, without commitment.

L. Ch. Amdt. is not otiose. It does strengthen law. Do we want to strengthen it?

M.A.F.F. If L. Ch. &amp; Att. Gen are right, v. dangerous. It gives trouble makers additional grounds for claiming that speaker has provoked them!

Home Sec. Say adequacy of existing law now reaffirmed. But, in addition to increasing penalties, Govt. will watch posn – leaving it to be inferred that addl legn may be introduced.

Ch. Duchy That is an invitation to e.g. Jews to break up a meeting.

L.P. No; they won‟t do it.

H. S. Yellow Star movement might.

L. Ch. If they do, we can‟t prosecute people holding the meeting. So, even if

Ch. Duchy right, no case for amending S.5.

First Sec. Then legislate for penalties and leave S.5. issue open.

Ch. Duchy I am very uneasy about this. [Exeunt Home Sec. &amp; Att. Gen.

6. Oversea Trade Negotiations (oral).

P.B.T. After collapse at Brussels, important to develop other opportunities.

a) Australian discussions. Agreed with McEwen to keep Trade Agt as is until G.A.T.T. prospects clearer.

b) E.F.T.A. Growing market: therefore agreement to get virtual free trade by end ‟66 valuable.

c) C‟wealth meeting. C‟wealth interests diverse: but united on expansion of world trade and C‟w. trade within it. U.K. an industrialised country: C., A. &amp; N.Z. temperate agricultural producers: rest are tropical products &amp; under developed. Pattern of C‟wealth trade may have to alter: but preserve sentimental links.

d) G.A.T.T.. U.S. favoured linear reduction: Six favoured decrètement of v. high tariffs. Compromise on linear cut (amount unspecified) as objective, with simultaneous ???? provided a real barrier to trade and not merely mathematical disparity.

I spoke up for L.D.C.‟s.

G.A.T.T. becoming v. complicated. No early result: cut, if it comes, can‟t be before end ‟64 at earliest. Suspicion between U.S. &amp; Six.

M.A.F.F. A. Austr. Agreement. Our wheat importers wd. not agree to extend cereals agt (wh. was only gentleman‟s understanding) into another year.

[Exit Ch. Exch.

P.B.T. I did not raise this with McEwen, pending G.A.T.T. But we may have to now. He will want a new agt for a fixed period of years.

M.A.F.F. Progress may be slow in G.A.T.T. But if failure, trade was between U.S. &amp; Europe inevitable. Therefore unlikely that French would break G.A.T.T. without breaking E.E.C. at same time.

7. Export of Arms to S. Africa. C(63) 8) [Enter M. Avn

Ch. Sec. As in memm. S.A. amnt simply for testing domestic prodn. Therefore approve. Amnt for tanks might also be used in civil disorders: but it is ordinary opl amnn of type wh. we have supplied previously. Therefore approve. Revolvers more awkward. S.A. won‟t withdraw request and will press for licence as test case. Issue of licence depends on U.S. agt. Watch repercussions of refusal on S‟town base.

L. Ch. Pass the buck to the U.S.?

Ch. Sec. Can we put all odium on them?

L.P. Revolvers are not weapons of oppression – like machine guns and armoured cars.

M. Avn Watch repercussions on aircraft orders, (wh. might not have arisen without Wilson‟s speech). Also prospective radar orders.

L.P. Some risk to destroyer orders for same reason.

Ch. Duchy Watkinson‟s letter warned S.A. not to expect revolvers. Why shd. we change this?

Ch. Sec. Because S.A. now making revolvers a test case in light of Wilson‟s speech.

M/S. F.O. I agree. We have asked S.A. to reconsider: and buck is with them. But if they continue to press, serious issues may arise. Healey interview on Panorama may have caused S.A. to refuse to place any more shipbuilding orders in U.K.

Com. Sec. Piecemeal approach wrong. It is overall impact on other African countries which matters. A Ghanaian now in chair of Secy Council: and Council may propose embargo on arms to S.A., which U.S. will probably support. Cttee. of Ministers shd. re-examine whole policy. I will reluctantly agree to first two items, but not revolvers.

L.P. Pass buck to U.S.?

M.A.F.F. If they refuse, S.A. will simply ask us for non L-L. revolvers.

M/S. F.O. And U.S., having morally committed us not to supply, will let their own mfctrs, in.

First Secy Refuse revolvers and consult U.S. Let first two orders go.

M.A.F.F. Even at risk of aircraft orders?

M. Avn And S.A. are trying to create own arms capacity – for which they might otherwise look to U.S. for machinery.

Ch. Sec. Let a Cttee. examine policy, and decision on revolvers to wait on that.

First Secy Agree: let first two orders go. F.O. to sound U.S. on revolvers.

[Exit M. Avn &amp; M.A.F.F.

8. Aid to Malaysia (oral).

Com. Sec. We proposed up to £15 m. for military aid. M. returned to consult Govt, who now say inadequate to enable them to provide for defence of Borneo territories.

They cd. provide more themselves, but only at expense of cutting devt programme wh. involves risks that they are not prepared to take.

Do we provide more money? £18.5 m. is total of for. exch. element in capital items. Shall we go to that – altho‟ they want help with current expdre. as well? Military sitn more critical then when we first set out to create Malaysia.

Ch. Sec. £15 m. was already beyond £12½ m. approved by Cab. It covers all for. exch. element so far as U.K. equipment concerned. Balance of £18½ m. is in respect of A. &amp; N.Z. equipment. Malaya is v. rich.

L.P. Better to put in an extra battalion of our own?

Com. Sec. They wd. have to be stationed there permanently: and we are trying to reduce in Singapore as result of shifting intl secy responsy to Malaysia. We shall have to put our offer up, in one way or another. Lansdowne must be authorised to negotiate on this basis, without any definite figure.

Ch. Sec. No: v. unwise. He must merely discuss &amp; report.

9. Television Bill (oral).

Ch. Duchy Possible to appease back bench discontent as regards levy and second channel by indicating, in debate, that second channel might be conceded if real demand.

10. London Railway Fares (oral).

M. T. L. Trans. &amp; Br. Rlways. announce increase in fares as from 23 June. I can‟t intervene. 10% increase over 4 miles, tapering off over 30 miles. No increase under 4 miles.
