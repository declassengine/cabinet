C.C.(63)6 24 January 1963 10.30 a.m.

1. Parly. Business (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip.

Ch.Duch. As in statement.

2. Foreign Affairs (oral). [Enter M/S. Col. Affairs. (Lansdowne)

a) Togo.

F.Sec. New all party Govt. in control. No obstacles (other than repercussions in Yemen) to recognition. Nigeria nervous : but if content, may I recognise at discretion? Re-recogn. necessy. on a violent change : but we might avoid it altogether. I will consider.

P.M. Avoid making heavy weather of it, if possible.

b) Hong Kong.

F.Sec. C.Chinese have challenged our jurisdiction in Kowloon. Under original treaty Ch. had some jurisdiction: but this was ended in 1899.

We have therefore rejected claim, but have deferred resettlement pending explanation that it is for transfer of locals.

Real Chinese motives. Beginning of pressure on us to deal with saboteurs from Formosa; even more serious. If so, we can‟t defend H.K.

c) Indonesia.

F.Sec. Ind. infiltration of Borneo, if serious, cd. be substantial. We are consulting U.S. and Australia; considering military measures : and shall try to dissuade Philippines from supporting Ind.

M.Def. Must enlist active support of Phil. Mutual assistance pact worth considn.

M/S.Col. West Irian is rub. Ind. banked on non-interference by U.S. and U.K. They were right and are now more aggressive. Our success in Brunei has deflated this : we must now try to frighten them, by joint demarche of us, U.S. Aus. N.Z. Malaysia and Philippines. Must seek agreed policy : and then warn Ind. to desist or be resisted by force: and finally seek some positive action (?Common Market) to help Ind.

M.Def. But act urgently to warn Ind. Military threat may be v. real and close.

[Exeunt L.P.S &amp; M/S.Col.

[Enter M. Power &amp; Sol. Gen

3. Industrial Disputes : Elecy. Indy C.(63)7.

Home Sec. Memm. examines possible courses of action but makes no recomn.

M.Lab. agrees. But public opinion won‟t tolerate repetition of present sitn. 1920 Act not relevant to severe weather : no power to impose rationing or restriction of supply.

Only limited chance of including ban on elecy. strike is new measure about contracts of Empt.

Para.8 : not hopeful for peace time. Para.9. not easily enforceable.

Para.10 : this wd. have caught current work to rule : but doubtfully desirable. Para.12 : non legve. action. Which course worth further examn?

L.Ch. Are these rules in elecy.? If not, working to rule might be a breach of contract of Empt. and para.4. wrong; and prosecution of Communists might be possible.

M.Power. No formal rules : but accepted custom wh. is equivalent to rule.

Industry divided on proper reaction : little gain in specific action against go slow. Legn. is wrong way of tackling problem. Better to try to create greater sense of responsy. and to improve status and conditions of workers.

Ch.Duchy. Legn. v. doubtful on merits. But Contracts of Employment Bill has been opposed by both sides of industry : and some pressure in Parlt. to incorporate a power to act.

Sol.Gen. Experience shows folly of using criminal law in indl. action.

Legn. therefore not to be recommended.

M.Edn. Para.10. politically unacceptable. Para.9. open to Sol. Gen‟s objn.

M.Health. I agree. Avoid action wh. is impracticable.

L.Ch. Para.10 is best : and compatible with C. of E. Bill.

M.Trans. Consider Swedish procedure, which T.U.C. are known to favour.

Ch.Sec. Para.10 best.

M. Power. But cd. employers make effective?

Sol.Gen. And difficult to establish conspiracy? Are you conspiring if you stay at home with a headache?

P.M. Avoid amdt. to C. of E. Bill wh. might be embarrassing and try to substitute an acceptable amdt. or proposal of our own.

Ch.Duchy. Why not para.10 by Proclamation rather than Bill?

L.Ch. But Proclamation not effective without statute.

If para. 10 terms of contract must be specified more accurately.

P.M. Home Sec. to examine further – either for new Bill or for amdt. of C. of E. Bill. Consult Ch. Duchy. M. Lab. Ch. Whip.

Supplies of coal?

M.Power. Quite good. But movement of stocks difficult.

P.M. E.P.C. shd. consider. We cd. supply military man power and transport.

Have these ready at short notice. M. Power to consult M. Def. and S of S.War.

Get publicity for what we do.

[Exit M.Power and Sol. Gen.

4. Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland C.(63)8.

L.Ch. Redraft emphasises minute and verbatim record too prominently.

First Secy. proposes omission of refce to Preamble to para.14 and rewords para.14. (See tesl). It doesn‟t really matter.

Main point to emphasise is 1953 discussns. limited to powers of four Govts. in context of review. Secession of Ny. looks like unilateral breach of this by one of them. R.W. has distorted this and we must correct him.

Publicn. can wait First Secy.‟s. return : but shd. precede debate on 18 Feb. Balance of advantage in favour of publn, subject to incorporation of First Secy.‟s amdts. and to attempt to persuade Swinton and Chandos (but not Boyd or Salisbury) to accept it.

P.M. Para.2. “After consultn.”? Confirm all four.

Para.11 ? Reserve for debate.

Defer decision on publicn. until First Secy.‟s return. Sitn. eased by new Govt. of S. Rh. since now no support for Fedn.

F.Sec. Avoid “secession” : present as a decision by us to take N. out.

Otherwise inconsistent with Lyttelton‟s undertaking that nothing cd. liquidate constn. without agreement of all from Govts.

L.Ch. But in context of review and subject to Greenfield‟s acceptance that U.K. alone cd. override all four.

Ch. Duchy. Make this clear by adding para.7(a) to para.5.

Reaction of Chandos and Swinton v. important. Approach them forthwith.

L.Ch. I agree.

F.Sec. I‟m not sure we shall get away with this.

L.Ch. We shall if we do everything we can to show the reader how the

discussion went at the time.

M.Def. Suppose Chandos and Swinton refuse to endorse this?

L.Ch. Must reconsider.

P.M. Yes. And if they endorse R.W.‟s view, why didn‟t they say so?

They must support us. But will our interpretn. convince general public?

F.Sec. I agree : probably not. But we shall be driven to publish by charge of concealment. Publish after debate.

P.M. Or just before. But don‟t give public too long to analyse it.

Keep (unless our hand is forced) until First Secy. returns.

Meanwhile consult Chandos and Swinton.

F.Sec. Cd. our interpretn. be challenged in courts?

L.Ch. I will consider. But we shd. win.

5. House of Lords Reform. C.(63)6.

Ch.Duchy. We shd. –

a) offer non-committal debate, keeping all doors open.

b) stress package deal : otherwise two Houses will make

incompatible amdts.

c) take advantage of public mood in favour of reform –

provided no conflict between L. &amp; C.

L.Ch. I agree – even tho‟ proposals are too favourable to Lords.

M.Health. I disagree with substance fundamentally. But on procedure? put debates later. We mustn‟t take a stand too soon.

Ch.Duchy. But it mustn‟t be dragged out of us.

Home Sec. And don‟t compel constituency associations to defer choice of candidates.

P.M. ?Any risk of defeat of Govt. Bill in Lords.

Ch.Duchy. Salisbury is the key.

L.Ch. No : he has no following.

P.M. Don‟t hurry it : but don‟t delay it. Can‟t hold Lords too long.?Simultaneous debates or Lords first. Must consider.
