C.C.(63)7 25 January 1963. 11 a.m.

1. Common Market. (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip.

P.M. Must decide on our aim when L.P.S. returns to Brussels on Sunday and our attitude to developments thereafter.

L.P.S. Six meet at 3.15 Monday. Have seen their Ambass. here. Five remain firm, but not optimistic. No change in French attitude.

Adenauer did not press de G. hard. Five may therefore try to agree on production of report – analysing sitn. and proposing solns,. Fr. not likely to agree. Belgians have produced (and privately agreed with us) their own account of state of play : circulated as confce. document to all 7). This cd. be basis of Commission‟s report – provided it is produced for continuance of negotns. i.e. quickly, with proposals and in good faith.

If Fr. won‟t play, Five may want to work out a soln. with us.

Spaak has proposed this. Again, speed and good faith are relevant.

Is it a trap to get us to show our hand to no purpose?

Or a desire to enable Community to produce proposals on own responsy., wh. we and Five cd. then accept? But Cmn.. must act on behalf of Six. Wd. it bring Fr. to heel? Or precipitate collapse of Community? Can only judge in Brussels.

?An inter govtl. confce. Not v. likely to be profitable.

? Assocn. gambit. Fr. may press Five to propose this. But Five know the difficulties, particularly exclusion of other E.F.T.A. members.

If proposed, we must press for v. full explication : lack of control.

Our objective to keep close to five, provided they stand firm and keep faith and we don‟t lose present moral advantage.

P.M. Beware of fake negotns. – in return for prize wh. wd. no longer be what we wanted. Therefore proposals in “report” shd. be by Commission not us.

F.Sec. But they must consult us : otherwise proposals will be unreasonable but onus of break will be on us.

Ch.Exch. And natural inclinn. of Cmn. . is to mediate between Five and Fr. not between Six and us.

F.Sec. Don‟t pin hopes on ratification of Fr. - G. agreement. Not due till May : and G. welcome it.

M.A.F.F. Negotns. with Comn in good faith incompatible with Fr. veto.

de G. won‟t climb down to this extra; and result wd. be even less favourable than result of direct negotn. with Five. Any dealing with Cmn.. cd. only be on clear basis of no Fr. veto. V. unlikely.

L.P.S. But compare Mansholt report on agricre. Why not repeat for negotn as

a whole, particly. since Mansholt believes agricl. agreement possible?

We shdn‟t be committed.

F.Sec. But it wd. enable Fr. to put us in wrong again.

M.A.F.F. Mansholt agricl. soln. tolerable if we are really going in. But not otherwise.

P.M. We shd. say we won‟t negotiate unless on genuine basis – i.e. no Fr. veto.

If – but only if – this is clear, we cd, agree that Cmn.. procedure shd. operate, on basis that all parties (incl. Fr.) wd. then accept or reject.

M.A.F.F. But if Fr. won‟t withdraw veto, dangerous to start sham negotns. either with Five or with Cmn..

M.Health. And Fr. cd. purport to withdraw political veto but still reject proposals on technical grounds. It is their intention that matter.

L.P.S. We shd. say we will only entertain new project if proved to be in good faith and in continuance of negotns. Fr. prob. won‟t agree : and we can then break with clean hands.

M.Def. Must keep Five with us : and some Fr. are anxious to retreat. Therefore keep open mind about a Cmn. project.

Ch.Duchy. Still worth negotg. if chance of success. But chance is slight, both politically and for M/Health‟s reason. de G. has already made up his mind. Therefore we shd. break now and not let Fr. wriggle off the hook.

Com. Sec. But Five, if tough, could overrule de G. All not yet lost.

P.M. ? Say that either Six or Cmn.. shd. produce, quickly, a plan (with our collaboration) wh. everybody must then accept or refuse.

Six cd. be required to say first : - i.e. wd. you be prepared to accept Br. readiness to accept as evidence of their entitlement to enter. This leaves Fr. on the hook.

L.Ch. Not v. dignified. ?Better to have it out with Five now.

Home Sec. I agree. We can‟t take initiative unless de G. publicly withdraws. Only Five can do this : and self preservation may move them.

P.M. But we shall be asked, whether we will accept Cmn.. procedure.

We can answer as I have suggested or stipulate for prior Fr. assurance that, if technical difficulties overcome, Fr.will withdraw all objection.

If we deal with Five alone, they must break with Fr.

F.Sec. P.M.‟s line depends on Cmn.. project being acceptable to us.

Can we be sure? If not, our last posn. worse than first.

P.S. Negotns. with Five unreal. We shd. abandon it. Better to stay away from Brussels on Monday, till Six have sorted themselves out.

L.P.S. We shd. lose chance of influencing Five and play into Fr. hands.

M.A.F.F. Tell Five we will only continue if Fr. give us some guarantee of goodwill.

P.M. Fr. wd. pretend to give it and so ensnare us in a new and long negotn.

M.A.F.F. They couldn‟t : issues are quite clear.

But if Cy. dissolves we can start again with the Five.

M.Def. But we must keep close to Five.

L.Ch. Fr. must give assurances, satisfy. to Five and to us, that any negotns. will be in good faith and speedy. Five shd. take this line with Fr. - and not leave it simply to us.

Ch.Exch. Five know Fr. won‟t give assurances, therefore they will be able to accuse us of wrecking the Cm.. project.

C.Sec. The Cmn. report is the Five‟s face saver. Therefore let it be produced, demonstrating what cd. have been demonstrated by negotns. between Five and us. Leaves Fr. on hook.

F.Sec. Fr. cd. prolong battle on merely technical issues. eg. N.2, and dairy products.

M.Def. But they have agreed to continue negotns. Leave it to them to walk out rather than insist on prior assurance that they will stay.

Ch.Duchy. Put our dilemma to Fr. by means of Five : they must get our guarantees for us before we resume negotns.

L.P.S. Five wd. then ask Cm. to produce report and solutions and wd. ask Fr. to confirm that this was part of continuance of negotns. and wd. be ready to consider result on merits without political prejudice. Report wd. be basis for further negotns. – not a take it or leave it package.

I agree: but Fr. won‟t accept. If it is clear that they have broken, least damage will be done to our relations with Five.

P.M. Agree. Emphasise to Five risks to them of breaking in a way whch turns U.K. public opinion against them. Therefore Cm. project must be limited in scope to purely technical items, and Fr. must pronounce on these alone.

Ch.Duchy. Don‟t press latter point. They can‟t repudiate de G.

F.Sec. But why use Cmn. at all? As a face saver for Fr. But their proposals may put us back on hook. Revert to direct negotn. and require Fr. to return.

P.M. Our dignity can‟t accept protracted negotns. after de G.‟s snub, wh. Five resent as much as we do. Therefore unless Fr. withdraw de G.‟s words, we must bring it to an end wh. makes truth clear. We mustn‟t get back on hook.

Must persuade Five to see this and to make it clear to Fr. that negotns. must continue on basis of scope limited to outstanding issues, speedy soln., good faith and preferably by machinery of Five and ourselves direct.

Assocn. only tolerable if E.E.C. became member of E.F.T.A.

Ch.Exch. Objns. to assocn. ought to be more publicly known – to protect us later.

L.P.S. Get Fr. to spell it out – and then publish it : but later, not now.
