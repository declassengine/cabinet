C.C. (63) 31 15th May, 1963 3.30.pm H/C

India and Pakistan C (63) 82. Resumed.

P.M. Circulate draft tel. to Kennedy.

Com Sec. V. negative: and leaves decision in air. Neither we nor U.S. can say anything T.T.K. ?Effect in Delhi.

Latest indication (via U.S. Embassy) is that K. will tell T.T.K. that programme must be cut in amount and extended in time: promise a series of discussions ( i.e. successive allocations of aid); emphasise need to avoid creating new stresses with Pak and that effort shd. be concentrated on Kashmir settlement; undertake to help with eg. military roads, to supply transport aircraft etc., to train Indian Officers, to supply some equipment. They will put new aircraft lower and say that they are considering interim possibilities – e.g. training squadrons on rotational basis.

Difficult to refuse to share aid on 50/50 basis and to reject umbrella.

F.Sec. Kill umbrella stone dead at this stage.

M.Edn. If so, recognise that we must give some more aid even in absence of K. settlement.

F.Sec. No. Wd. embarrass K. vis a vis Congress: and wd. give P. an excuse to run out – of C.E.N.T.O. inter alia.

L.P.S. Don‟t waste more money on country whose foreign-policy we can‟t influence. And shd. be conditional on K. settlement.

F.Sec I agree. US give aid to P. and then expect us to give matching aid to India.

Com.Sec. U.S. will give aid to India even without K. settlement. But latest report suggests that they don‟t intend to commit themselves on umbrella at this stage. Therefore play for time on this. Concentrate on aid.

P.M. But we can‟t afford it.

F.Sec. And if they wd. settle with P. they wouldn‟t need as much.

But umbrella wd. be a intolerable moral commitment: we shd. kill it now. Kennedy won‟t press it. But beware of U.S. desire to become committed.

S. of S. Air Yes he will – because he thinks India will refuse it.

Com. Sec. We can‟t send a wholly negative reply to Kennedy.

P.M. [Great outburst against the U.S.]

F.Sec. We shd. refuse any more aid to India except on a “whole continent”: basis.

P.M. At least raise discrimn against Br. shipping.
