C.C. (63) 39. 20 June 1963. 10 a.m.

1. The Prime Minister (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip.

P.M. Grateful for support in recent episode. Now get on with governing country.

2. Parliament (oral).

Ch. Duchy As in Statement.

Motion to-day deploring Profumo‟s Parly conduct. ? P.C. status.

P.M. P. has asked me to divest him of P.C. status.

No clear precedent. Duke of Coburg, on becoming foreign Sovereign, informed Q. Victoria that he intended to resign: but nothing done. Also

? say he has suffered enough: but also preserve status of P.C‟ship. Therefore say to-day that P. has offered to resign: now being examined in light of consl implicns as P has asked to be examined etc. Reject suggn P. shd be called to Bar of House and apologise.

L.P. Must make some statement commenting on allegations made against me in Commons – “lying humbug” etc. [Wigg &amp; Paget.]

3. Foreign Affairs (oral).

a) Greece.

F.S. Govt. (Karamanlis) resigned, ostensibly because of dispute over Royal Visit, actually for internal political reasons. Caretaker Govt. will consent to State Visit: &amp; K. will acquiesce. Will concert with Home Secy to keep order during visit.

b) Iraq.

War between Iraq &amp; Kurds renewed. Govt. acting ruthlessly. Must watch Br. Subjects in area of Kirkuk. And delay delivery of arms wh. we have undertaken to provide: otherwise may be used in air strike against Kurds, particularly rockets.

M. Def. Don‟t obstruct Iraqi Govt. too much.

F.S. But they are anti-ommunist.

P.M. Deliver by schedule.

c) Indonesia.

F.S. Atmosphere a little better after 3 partite meeting.

d) Laos.

F.S. Only façade of Geneva agreements remains. But worth preserving.

e) S. Africa.

F.S. Trouble increasing over S.W. Africa: sanctions by U.N. etc. See Maud‟s final despatch (circulated). Must have full discussion soon.

4. Resignation of S of S. for War (oral).

P.M. Have circulated my letter &amp; H.W.‟s reply.

Enquiry necessary: based on security: comprehending all issues from P. case: judicial – not S. Cttee., wh. is cumbrous, Party-ridden and unsuitable for security issues and risky (in hands of non legal Chairman) while Ward trial in train.

Oppn may press, by Motion, for S. Cttee. We must vote it down: could we be sure of winning?

Ch. Exch. I agree.

Home Sec. I too: but don‟t stress prejudice to Ward: S. Cttee. could sit in private.

F.S. Public want impartial enquiry, not a Party dogfight.

Ch. Duchy Govt.‟s supporters would come round to this.

P.M. Then proceed as in draft Statement. Invest with „21 powers if necy.

L.P.S. Why not at once?

A. Gen. If given powers, Act compels him to sit in public, unless special reason.

L. Ch. First part of remit does not require powers: even second part – if not to become “trial” of Ministers on basis of rumours alone – shd. be primarily opportunity for people to substantiate rumours, if they can. Witnesses protected against libel by privilege, if not malicious; if malicious, why shd. they be protected? But if D. can‟t get evidence, on this account, without powers, he must ask for them – and become a ‟21 tribunal.

Ch. Duchy That wd. take a day‟s debate: so would Resn on S. Cttee. Can we save time by adopting ‟21 procedure from outset?

L. Ch. It would enable anybody to defame any Minister, with complete immunity.

First Secy I agree. I would omit even reference to investing D. with powers, if necessary.

M. Def. I agree. Any reference to ‟21 procedure will be attacked by Press.

P.M. Must discuss – genuinely – with H. Wilson to-day: announce to-morrow.

F. Sec. Cd. M.W.P. mobilise decent Press in support of counter-offensive against rumours. It must be spontaneous move by Press.

L. Ch. The alleged plot.

Com. Sec, Personal Statement. Subject to discussn with P.M.. I shall resign.

P.M. My three principles, I will act only on fact, nor rumour. Therefore I will not ask for any resign on rumour. Only if a Minister judges that he shd. resign will I accept it. Com. Sec. has acted v. honourably.

5. Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (oral).

First Secy R.W. will try:-

a) to wreck the conference.

b) to saddle U.K. with Federal Public Debt.
