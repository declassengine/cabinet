C.C. (63) 32 16th May, 1963 10.30.am

1. Parliament (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip

Ch. Duchy. As in statement.

2. Foreign Affairs (oral)

a) U.S.A.

F. Sec. O. Gore returning for discussions. Report next week.

b) Iceland

F.Sec. Row with Iceland on escape of man who shd. have stood trial in Iceland.

Try to compose if possible: unfortunate implications for fisheries dispute.

3. International Financial Policy (oral).

Ch. Exch. Intal liquidity discussions going slowly. Meanwhile, propose to take advantage of U.S. technique of currency swaps, wh. reinforce both currencies. $500m swap. Under discussion.

4. Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (oral)

First Secy. We have now agreed with Field (in discussion with High Commissioner,):-

a) constl changes to be made by S. Rh., not Imperial, Parliament.

b) independence confce (to discuss terms)

c) S. Rh. indepce to coincide with dissoln of Fedn.

Therefore tell him that we agree, subject to settlement of terms of indepce.

On timetable, propose early discussn on indepce: simultaneously issue invitations to dissoln confce: resume indepce talks, if necessary, later.

[Exit First Secy

5. Housing Policy. C (63) 80 &amp; 84. [Enter M.P.B.W.

M.H.L.G. Rising popn &amp; standards make increased programme essential. This must include repair &amp; improvement of existing houses. This involves realistic basis of subsidies and rents, as proposed, particularly as regards privately controlled rents. Pledged to avoid further decontrol in this Parlt-; but must be ready with new policy for election.

Stimulate Housing Assocn movement as integral part of this.

Note two changes:-

a) Appendix on increased L.A. slum clearance programmes. V. impressive.

b) Amdt to para. 40. £100m limit to be specified.

M.H. Last 50 years have dislocated normal supply/demand machinery. The Jaguar now waits outside a slum house. Don‟t do more in this direction, through mere impatience with this. Hence propose:-

a) Emphasis shd. be limited to sector under our control. Leave rest open to private enterprise. A total target has dangerous political implications.

b) Housing Corpn is example of fallacy that good will without profit can achieve (better) what profit alone shd. achieve.

c) Compulsory improvement alien to Consve philosophy of establishing standards and leaving private enterprise to conform.

Ch. Duchy. On a), better on balance to have a target. On (b), arguments v. evenly balanced, but accept M.H.L.G. On (c) M.H. right; at least delete applicn to owner-occupiers on change of occupancy.

In addition, on paras 74-81: subsidies paras are right, cost paras give serious political hostages to fortune. Therefore omit 77-78.

S. of S. Scot. No Housing Assocns in Scotland. We need the proposed Corpn to stimulate increase in L.A. rents.

On improvements, we need some compulsory powers because of multiple ownership of tenement blocks.

M.H.‟s points not valid in relation to Scotland.

M.P.B.W. Target shd. be accepted. Also Housing Assocn measure.

Ch. Sec. a) Target doubtful. Reduces freedom of measure for rest of public investment programme.

b) Para 11. Current rate of interest. Make clear this means Govt borrowing rate plus management charge.

c) On compulsion. I agree with Ch. Duchy about o-o‟s on change of occupancy.

L. Ch O-o houses can change to tenanted and back again. Compulsory powers will be difficult and unpopular. Encouragement and incentive wiser. Don‟t overstress H. Assocn: won‟t achieve much. Target over period of years doubtfully wise.

L.P. Target may be forced out of us.

On L.A.‟s, must try to group them regionally. Insert Newcastle as a centre.

On design, see para 28. But do more – on schools model.

M.W.P. Target – without a fixed term – not too dangerous.

M.T. Private enterprise will never again build to let. H. Assocn technique right. 350,000 is 100,000 short of 450,000 needed. Answer is in construction industry: it needs to be enlarged and modernised in technique (cf. C.L.A.S.P. system for schools). We must do this in partnership with industry.

M.P.B.W. I agree. But no prospect of large expansion; therefore emphasise methods to increase efficiency – the Gibson setup; co-ordination of L.A. orders; promotion of central building agency. All this now being discussed.

M.H.L.G. On o-o, compulsion wd. not apply to eg. widow. But can‟t compel a landlord without compelling o-o next door – at time when he moves and if he lives in improvement area. But proposal not essential to W.P.: compulsion cd. be confined to Landlords at tenant‟s request - wh is the essential point.

On para 77-78. We must have a policy for election. 2m controlled houses, leaving control at 1/4m a year. If we moved to current valuation of these, about 12/3rd wd. rise by 5/ - 7/6 a week in rent. balance by 12/- a week. We cd. limit rise by statute, as before. But it wd. compare badly with other measures, particularly compulsion.

Ch. Duchy 74-76 are safe ground and say all that need be said now.

Leave election manifesto till it comes. As it is, end of para 77 is weak.

M.H.L.G. I wd. accept this.

On H. Corpn, I agree with M.H. But profit motive is at work – in shape of people who form H. Societies to escape rent control V. heavy applicns to rent these houses at economic, unsubsidised, rents.

On target, unrealistic to omit or to appear to rest on existing target of 300,000.

On design, see refce to SM system in para 26.

P.M. Building to let won‟t revive – except in tied houses for e.g. miners. Therefore back H. Assn on a big scale, as altve to leaving it all to L.A.‟s. It will work for profit motive. At present assocns borrow all money from Exch: henceforward, Bldg. Socs. will put up (and have agreed) 2/3.

On compulsion, avoid it for o-o. Leave it to persuasion.

Omit (or redraft) paras 77-78.

On target, keep up our reputation as builders of houses. Risk of overloading building industry shd. be accepted. Take 350,000 for time being. (?400,000 for election).

Press on with modernisation of techniques.

M.H.L.G., Ch. Duchy, M.W.P. to consider drafting; presentation on publicn (when? fairly soon); desirability of debate: omission of para 84: improvement of presentation (? coloured cover).

6. Satellite Communications C (63) 83. [Enter M.Avn; S. of S. Air; P.M.G. M/S. C.R.O.; M. Edn.

L.P.S. We decided on single system, provided we had a fair share and reached reasonable arrangements with Europe – reserving right to go it alone with Europe, if U.S. won‟t play fair.

We proposed Eur. discussions. So did French. We have tried to harmonise on timetable: hence present plan. But on policy, Fr. want a separate, European, Fr. controlled system, excluding Australia and using French (not E.L.D.O.) equipment. But they may realise it wd. be economically impracticable.

This affects agenda for first confce, particularly item 1. We must maintain our attitude, wh. is supported by Germany &amp; Scandinavia.

Avoid Eur. orgn, if possible, at this stage. First get policy of Eurn participation settled. Meanwhile compromise on standing committee, whose seat shd. be in London, in order to present centralisation of space interests under Fr. domination.

M. Avn. Avoid discussion on global system or Intl agt. All communication must be agt. – between several systems, if necy. Therefore avoid choice, at this stage, between single system or Eurn system.

Concentrate on our share of system: our bargaining counter are control over eastern terminal of trans Atl traffic and our technical capability as members of E.L.D.O.

Don‟t quarrel with French: unless we both agree, Europe can‟t bargain with U.S.A. This is more important than Australia.

L.P. But there will be only one system for some time, because only one country can create it. May change latter: but immediate need is to ensure part for Europe in first system. This means a Eurn orgn – but not an E.L.D.O.- type assocn; rather a political unity to bargain with U.S.A. and a technological unity to confront U.S. techl lead.

M/S.C.R.O. Must keep old C‟wealth informed. Aust. observer at confces will suffice.

L.P.S. I agree on techl co-opn with Europe: but avoid orgn with voting rights etc., wh. wd. be forced to take a “European” view as distinct from an Atlantic view.

We must get into ownership of system at outset. This means using our limited resources for this: not wasting them on Eur. system and having nothing left to contribute to global system wh. the U.S. will establish.

M.Avn. We may get a smaller share in global system at outset (because of U.S. technical lead) than later.

L.P.S. But we are politically well placed to press U.S. at this point.

P.M.G. Fr. conception of short term co-opn with U.S. unrealistic. Confine immediate discussions to technical &amp; business issues.

M. Def. Beware of alienating Fr. by stressing differences. Confine discussns to points of agreement: if so must face some concessions to Fr. on orgn, since we must have them in if we are to reach any tolerable deal with U.S.

L.P.S. Not at price of accepting something wh. is economically unrealistic and will not be technically feasible for a long time. U.S. wd. simply go it alone and push us out of market.

M.Avn. Don‟t decide now. Discuss with Fr. approach to U.S. based on either sharing in single system or establishing Eur system.

L.P. Must have a share in first system, without abandoning hypothesis of separate system later.

P.M.G. But if U.S. won‟t let us have real share of first system, we shd. be ready to operate a separate system.

P.M. We must have dual approach, in order to bargain for share at outset. But that doesn‟t involve putting our money on separate system at this stage.

L.P.S. But avoid any move towards country wh. doesn‟t intend to accept global system at all.

L.P. That intention is technically unrealistic. Once U.S. system is in operation, Fr. cd. never run a separate system.

Ch. Exch. I agree with L.P.S.

P.M. Concentrate on hard bargaining with U.S.

[Exeunt M.Avn; S. of S.

air; P.M.G.: M.P.B.W.

7. Agricultural Policy (oral). [Enter Parly Sec. B/T.

M.A.F.F. Pending debate convenient for announcing new policy.

Thereafter:-

a) introduce legn early in next session.

b) begin negotns in order to have legn ready.

L.Ch. Para. 2. Amend to emphasise new policy in interest of farmers as well as taxpayer.

F. Sec. “Proportionate share” of growth?

Ch. Exch. “Fair”: is better presentationally.

P.M. Amend to emphasise periodical review possibilities? Keep “proper balance” and indicate this will be reviewed (?annually).

L.Ch. Last para. Reintroduce idea of “food for the farmer as well as the taxpayer”? Or omit the taxpayer.

M.W.P. Avoid publicn simultaneously with W.P. on housing.

P.M. Defer housing for a week? Unless agricl statement can be made (preferably) in a debate.

[Exit M/S. C.R.O.; F. Sec.

8. Shipbuilding (oral)

Ch. Exch. World overcapacity: U.K. prodn now below “normal” level.

Industry will buy up redundant yards from own fund. Our help shd. not be a “scrap and build” scheme; nor a tax scheme (since they ie. ship owners are not paying taxes and investt allces are inadequate).

Better to help with finance, via Shipbldg. Mortgage Corpn, who wd onlend (without extra cost) money lent at Govt. rates for orders within specified period. This wd. bring orders forward. This wd correct anomaly tht foreign orderers can get (via E.C.G.D.) more favourable treatment than U.K. orderer.

M.H. Shall we do everything on Govt. Loans? An interesting devt of Consve policy!

M.P. A good scheme: and most of out competitors already do it. Announce before recess. Orders shd. be placed before March 64. Any total financial limit?

Ch. Exch. Must consider; also legn Consider whether possible in Finance Bill.

P.M. Approve.
