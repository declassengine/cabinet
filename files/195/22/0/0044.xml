C.C. (63) 44 4 July 1963. 10.30 a.m.

1. British Guiana (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip.

Col. Sec. Deteriorating situation. More reinforcements sent: more may have to be sent. Normal sitn – indepce under elected Govt. – impossible, because Govt. v. unstable &amp; unreliable. Altve – coalition of other parties – equally impossible, since it wd. be no more stable.

I may have to go out myself. May also have to suspend constn &amp; resume direct rule.

Ch. Duchy Remember Trinidad, who have solved Indian/negro problem. Bring Williams in at some stage.

Col. Sec. Will bear this in mind. I shall go via T. anyhow.

2. Br. Honduras (oral).

P.M. Circulate proposals to Cab. – even if only for information.

3. Parliament (oral).

Ch. Duchy As in Statement.

4. Foreign Affairs (oral).

a) Yemen.

F.S. Prisoners released – for £7500 (we hope! That is ceiling we stipulated to U.S.).

b) U.S. President‟s Visit.

P.M. Have reported to Parlt in yesterday‟s debate. But clear that special relationship persists: and that K. more concerned with test ban than M.L.F.

F.S. Must now take some initiative in N.A.T.O. on management of nuclear forces.

P.M. Yes: but all now depends on test ban.

5. Malta Independence. C(63) 112.

Col. Sec. As in memm. Must adhere to R.C. religion &amp; accept membership of C‟wealth – tho‟ Mintoff may oppose both. Monarchy more difficult: Crown ought not to become a Party issue. Therefore reserve issue until Confce takes place, when I can gauge??? opposn and will consult Cab. again.

P.M. Boers said same: but Crown lasted for 50 years in S. Africa.

Have we abandoned Crown in any case at outset?

Col. Sec. Kenya.

P.M. That is different. K. is to enter Fedn, wh. will be republican. But accept Col. Sec.‟s proposal.

L. Ch. Judicial Cttee. shd. persist or some altve form of appeal machinery even if republic.

F.S. Mustn‟t let Russia into Malta. ? Unwise to defer Def. Agt until after indepce or to have referendum. Don‟t rely on N.A.T.O. assocn.

Col. Sec. Agree. Rely on present Govt.‟s desire to have Agt as proposed. They will sign it. If a Mintoff Govt. repudiate it, we can‟t help that. We shdn‟t take it lying down. And it‟s v. unlikely: all the Island want us to stay. And N.A.T.O. wdn‟t tolerate a Cuba in Med: therefore referendum safe and wd. spike M.‟s guns to some extent.

F.S. Don‟t underrate dangers of R. threat. We might have to reactivate Malta.

M. Def. But we don‟t need Malta – except to prevent R. occupn.

P.M. And R.C. Church wdn‟t accept R. occupn.

Only altve is not to have indepce – wh. all Parties (except Strickland) want – and to continue to govern.

Ch. Exch. I support Col. Sec.

Col. Sec. Must also encourage emigration. Discussed with Menzies, who will help.

F.S. Reluctantly accept. Must continue to give aid in form of military personnel. [Exit Col. Sec.

6. Govt Offices: Dispersal: Flemming Report. C(63) 111.

[Enter M. Power: P.M.G.: Parly. Sec. M.P.B.W.

Ch. Sec. As in memm. If Cab. approve in principle, I will discuss with National Staff Side, invite Ministers to discuss with Deptl Staff Sides, and make Parly statement before Recess. Maintain pressure on natd industries and similar bodies.

L. Ch. Stop people coming in: but why drive them out, at cost in efficiency, if similar people will fill them – e.g. P. Trustee Office.

Ch. Sec. But we must set example in dispensing spenders and encouraging earners. Rents lower outside London: clerical staff more easily obtained. Will discuss individual cases: but endorse principle.

M.H.L.G. Every dispersal weakens demand: this, combined with location of Offices Bureau, will help to control pressure and ease travelling.

M.H. Policy sound. But in applicn, consider small groups – where advantage is v. marginal – sympathetically.

Ch. Sec. Agree. But several similar small groups useful contribn.

L.P. Remember needs of N.E. – whose devt wd. be positive side of this coin.

Ch. Sec. Agree. But in some cases physical limits on practicable distance.

P.M.G. S. Certs Division of P.O.S.B. (=2,500) already agreed for Durham.

P.O.S.B. prob. to near Harrogate.

S of S. S. Remember Scotland – as deserving as N.E.

L.P. No: Scot. Has own Dept. of State.

Ch. Sec. Will reconsider, for Scotland, rest of “no distance limit” batch – i.e. apart from P.O.S.B.

Home Sec. Statement in relation to rebuilding of F.O. – i.e. offset inefficiency by greater efficiency of concentrating London staffs.

M. Def. Agree. But get Def. reorgn- done first, before considering defence dispersal.

F.S. Flemming proposals for P. Control Office v. wide of mark. Approval in principle shdn‟t prejudge this.

L. Ch. ? Move P.R.O. out?

M.W.P. Can we avoid Statement?

Ch. Sec. No: must negotiate with staffs, and M.P.B.W. must plan.

P.M. Then don‟t blow it up. ? Written P.Q. Let Ch. Sec. &amp; M.W.P. discuss.

Also bring L.P. &amp; S of S. S. into detailed discussns of new locations.

[Exeunt M. Power: P.M.G: Parly Sec. M.P.B.W.

7. Welfare Services: School Meals. C(63) 110 and 113.

M. Edn As in memm. Some economy in edn expre essential: and case here is strong on merits. Sweeten by model scales – related to N.Assce scales – for relief for needy parents.

Date – Oct. – difficult for Scotland. Will discuss with him.

S of S. S. Agree on merits. But politically v. difficult in light of high unemplt in Scotland. We are under attack on school buildings &amp; teachers‟ pay: don‟t add this too. Sch. meals increasing in rural areas; in towns, standard remissions wd. be disastrous, since more free meals are provided in Glasgow than anywhere else, and “sweetener” wd. therefore work wrong way round.

Home Sec. Majority of H.A. favoured this: no support for different dates for E. and S. Minority opposed it.

L.P. Either do it now – or well after election.

Ch. Sec. Do it now. Public expre rising v. sharply – outstripping G.N.P.

Scots unempt irrelevant: anybody unemployed for long is on N.A. and therefore gets meals free anyhow.

Time when edn expre expanding sharply is right time.

Home Sec. I agree. In past have always overrated political effects. But watch hardship point.

Ch. Duchy I am against it, politically. In Oct. unempt will rise: Party Confces will be meeting; last session of Partt will be beginning. Bad time.

L. Ch. I agree: many low wage earners have large families.

Ch. Sec. And large family allowances.

P.M. Consider further. Two M. of Edn to circulate paper on how scheme works and how model scales wd. work.

? Cab. shd. consider with Ch. Sec.‟s memm on public expdre.

M. Lab. ? And with any proposals on sch. milk, family allces, etc.

8. Staggered Holidays. C(63) 108.

P.B.T. As in memm. Critical point is willingness to move W. &amp; A. Bank Holidays if public opinion responds to W.P. Churches (other than Romans) don‟t mind W., provided name changed.

Ch. Exch. V. sensible.

Ch. Duchy It doesn‟t propose a solution. Is this wise?

P.B.S. I wd. say, on publicn, that, if people respond, we wd. create working party to elaborate proposals.

L.P.S. ? Go further: move academic year to 1 Jan, and get exams over by June. Move financial year and Parly year in same way.

Home Sec. This wd. be beginning: it wd. persuade univs. To reconsider their arrangements. I support this – and timing.

M. Edn Schools will play if part of general plan. I support this &amp; wd. put it to new Schools Councils, when established.

P.M. Agree to publish.
