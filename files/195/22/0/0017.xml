C.C. (63) 17 1st March, 1963 10.30.am

1. Parliament (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip

Ch. Duchy. As in statement.

2. Foreign Affairs (oral)

a). Nato.

F. Sec. Our proposals for multinational force well received. French friendly but non-committal.

b) Somalia.

F. Sec. Rupture of negotns v. friendly But S. resists on dismantling of B.B.C. relay station at Berbera. Best to accept rather than leave to S.

Re-erect at Aden. Col. Secy to consider.

We also lose o‟flying rights. We shall stop aid. Shd. we allow S. consulate at Aden &amp; Narobi. Not safe to retain our own consulate.

P.M. There must be a study.

Ch. Sec. Stop cash aid: but continue locust orgn and Somali students here.

c) Export of pipe.

F. Sec. German Govt. have embargoed export. We are therefore only N.A.T.O country liable to permit export.

P.B.T. Only 2 firms involved: one v. secretive, other not likely to get order. We can impose export licensing on categories of product and then apply selective licensing. But our order might be larger as result of German ban.

Cg. Exch. Because G. prices are keener than ours! This makes it even more embarrassing.

P.M. Remit to S.E.C. – early report. L.P. to attend qua N.E.

3. Representation of the Vatican in the U.K. (oral)

P.M. Have reconsidered. Ap. Del is ecclesiastical: no dip. reprn – tho‟ we have one in Rome.

Discussed with Archp, who is against it. Afraid might complicate measures to improve spiritual relations.

Best to defer further action: ? review after next session of Vatican Council.

4. M. Bidault C. (63) 49. [Enter Att. Gen.

Home Sec. Hypothetical issue as in memon. He can‟t claim asylum here if some other country will take him. But there are others, who could be even more objectionable.

L. Ch. ? Accept him under conditions – no political activities etc.

F. Sec. But what is a political activity?

Home Sec. Agree. We have power to impose conditions: but definition and enforcement have always defeated us

Att. Gen. But we can send him back, under intl practice, to country he came from.

M. Trans. That country may send him back or elsewhere.

F. Sec. Warn Germans that, if they deport him to us, we shall not take him. Therefore they must send him somewhere else. (French have privately offered to pay his fare to S. America).

Home Sec. But if he – or associate – turns up here?

P.M. Detain him (as illegal immigrant) and consider. [Exit Att. Gen.

5. Federation of Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland. C.(63) 52.

First Secy Prelimy talks starting to-day, as prelude to confce. on dissolution of Fedn.

Field shd. argue for economic link between N. &amp; S. Rh. May also press for independence. This wd. be v. difficult in terms of Africa‟s and C‟wealth relations. Therefore try to leave this until Fedn issue settled. Signs of tendency to seek link with Union: and of repressive tendencies wh. I must try to moderate. N. Rh. will want recessive. Must try to avoid this as pre condition of their attendance at confce. Fedn will try to make political link between N. &amp; S. Rh.: a precondition. This will be unacceptable; and break may occur. If so, R.W. may organise referendum in order to outflank Field and reassume leadership of Europeans. May also resort to military force.

Shall aim at confce. on basis of no holds barred but no preconditions.

Will report progress at next week‟s Cab.

Parliamentary opinion now sees Ec links as more feasible – with some political direction at centre, for defence etc.

P.M. Endorse this line. Timing of break – whether by Fedn or by either of Rhodesias – difficult to foresee. We have little physical power to enforce a solution and grave sitn may develop.

First Secy. Assume no qun of conceding independence to S.Rh. yet.

P.M. Agree: but may be difficult to refuse to S.Rh. what we have conceded to Ny.

F. Sec. Easier to liquidate Fedl structure if some political – i.e Ministerial – link to give direction to Ec. Links.

First Secy Agree: but confined to Ec. items. No possibility of common policy on defence or external affairs. Ny may be brought in when date for secession announced.

6. The Beeching Plan C. (63) 53.

M. Trans. As in memm.

Draft statements.

L.P. Para 6. of memn. Shd. not T.U.‟s be seen before publicn rather than after?

M. Trans. They will be informed two days before publicn: Interval after publicn (Parly debate) allows time for reflection before unions are consulted.

Ch. Duchy. Statement: para 1. Must say copies in Vote Office.

Home Sec. Para 2. “Claim on Economic resourses” – too sophisticated for public.

S. of S. Scot. Also – since it is total subsidy – implies all railways to be closed.

P.M. Say that any reduction in the subsidy will release resources for better uses elsewhere.

M. Health Para. 4. Not clear – until last para. – what Govt. intend to do. ? Bring forward last para – to make clear that we must think before deciding.

Ch. Exch. Add “on these lines” to end of para 3.

M. Edn. And omit first sentence of para. 3.

P.M. Agree: or move to para 1. Insert “comprehensive”.

M. Power Para 5. Saving of 7/6. depends on other investmt in mechanised depots etc, neither railways nor Coal Board have much incentive to do this.

P.M. Modify to “substantial savings”. And don‟t attribute to Board. “It shd. be possible to achieve . . .”.

M. Trans. Para 7. Second sq. brackets. First ridiculous – only I. of Wight left!

P.M. Anyhow, omit “remote”. As in formula: then add “examples”.

Last sentence of para. 7 – must have a positive policy for roads and road transport services; and must admit obligation in this respect.

Ch. Exch. But can‟t afford to subsidise public against any inconvenience as result of Beeching.

M. H. Our responsy is limited to preventing hardship: must not go further.

Home Sec. Say “availability of altve transport no less important than closure of uneconomic rail services”.

L.P.S. Dangerous: might freeze pattern of transport.

M.Edn. Distinguish:

(i) need for balance between social &amp; economic considy.

(ii) need for balance between road &amp; rail in light of (i).

(iii) need for balance between transitional period &amp; permanent arrangements.

P.M. Also - (iv) need for buses where rail services are closed.

(iv) need for buses where no services exist as present.

M. Tr. I will redraft, with Ch. Exch. (or Ch. Secy) and M.W.P.

P.M. Yes: and say that we will see to it that necessary action is taken for purposes of para. 7.

Ch. Duchy Para 9 – Omit third sentence – an undesirable headline.

P.M. Agree. Keep for suppy.

M.M.L.B. Para 11. Must keep sq brackets.

L.CH. Add to revised para 7.

M. Tr. Publicity satisfy – except B.B.C.?

Present as foundation of new transport policy, wh. will emerge towards end of year and will be projected forward for 5 years.

P.M. Expedition of decisions – paras 8 &amp; 9 of memo.

M. Tr. Can accelerate tempo of working by panels.

L. Ch. Might be unfair: multiply number of councils. Panels are not subject to Council or Tribunals.

P.M. Consider more councils (= more chairmen).

Also group problems &amp; announcement of decisions as far as possible.

M. Tr. &amp; L.Ch. to consider, with S. of SS &amp; M/Wales.

[Exit L.P.S.; M. Power

7. Valuation for Rating (oral).

Ch. Exch. Debate off. Cd. we consider at greater leisure?

M.M.L.G. But pressure continues. Enquiry wd. be helpful – with first duty to examine hardship.

M.H. But area of enquiry important. Must consider first.

Ch. Exch. ? Cab. next week.

P.M. Tuesday‟s Cab.

8. Pay of Members of Parliament C (63) 50 &amp; 54.

Ch. Duchy. Accept L.P.‟s point. Some special arrangement to meet it.

No argument about merits: great feeling on this.

But what we do, and when, is political.

Either act now, as I propose – wh. wd. be popular in Parlt, but might be unpopular in country.

Or say now that we will do it after election – disastrous.

Or say no proposals in this Parlt. – wh. wd. cause some disappointment but wd. be accepted.

Ch. Exch. Early action bad for incomes policy.

M.W.P. Link with purchasing power wd. be new principle: and wd. have implications for status of Members and what wd. be expected of them.

L.P. Leader of Lords must be consulted before proposals are put to Cab.

P.M. We can‟t have election manifesto written for us. Must consider further whether to stand pat for this Parlt. and, if so, how and when to say so.

First Secy On merits, something needed now. Politically v. doubtful.

P.M. ? Some easement on e.g. tickets for wives travelling to constituencies.

L.P. With analogous concession for Lords.

P.M. Ch. Duchy‟s conclusion prob. right. But must consider timing.
