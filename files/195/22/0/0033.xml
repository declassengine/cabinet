C.C. (63) 33 21 May 1963. 11.30 a.m.

1. Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. C(63) 85 and 86.

P.M. 1) We want orderly dissoln of Fedn. Must induce all parties to come to Confce.

2) We want to preserve C‟wealth: must therefore take account of views of other members, both white and black, on terms of indepce for S. Rh.

Can we achieve both without asking more of Field than he can give?

First Secy Field will now come to London for discussions in accordance with decision at last Cabinet. He will expect constructive discussions, recognising that S. Rh. is overdue for indepce and that he is pledged to his own electorate. Field may break – and so may we – on terms.

Problem posed in para. 2 of C(63) 85, especially last sentence.

Talks with Field will not be satisfactory to Pan-African sentiment. But we may get more participn by Africans in govt, and non-discrimn. This wd. satisfy majority of Consve opinion in Parlt. Proposals are in para. 6, 7 &amp; 8. If these are approved I will make to-day statement in Parlt on lines of circulated draft. “Issuing invitations” instead of “communicating with”? Preferably not: but might be wise. Might be desirable to adjourn indepce discussions in order to get on with links confce. But this may be too optimistic.

L.P.S. Parly statement may lead to questions: better issue to Press?

L.P. But that merely leads to speculation, wh. is worse than questioning.

Com. Sec. C‟wealth oppn to S. Rh. indepce with present constn wd. be opposed by A. &amp; N.Z. as well as black members. But we shan‟t get S. Rh. to accept changes wh. rest of C‟wealth wd. bless.

Therefore must warn Field that we don‟t concede indepce without majority Govt and ask him what he proposes. Avoid committing ourselves to any specific change, falling short of African expectations, wh. we wd. accept. He will reject it in any case: and we shd. then have worst of both worlds.

L. Ch. I agree. Choice lies between settlement wh. H/C. wd. accept or a break. If C‟wealth realise that we have done our best, they may acquiesce. They must realise that we can‟t get all they wd. like.

Com. Sec. A settlement wh. H/C. wd. accept but rest of C‟wealth might reject might best be discussed with rest of C‟wealth – putting altve to them squarely. Can‟t exaggerate dangers to C‟wealth. We must avoid any specific commitment.

Ch. Exch. Can we do this and confine ourselves to merely asking Field for his suggns.

Com. Sec. First get F. on the hook. Then try to find a compromise acceptable to rest of C‟wealth (who have not so far considered anything except choice between two extremes).

Ch. Exch. A normal indepce confce is attended by all main parties. Wd. C‟wealth really refuse S. Rh. membership with present constn? V. illogical.

Com. Sec. Possibly: but they wd. probably destroy C‟wealth, or at least refuse support to U.N.

L.P. Must persuade rest of C‟wealth that we shall be better able to bring pressure to bear on S. Rh. after indepce than at present when she can embarrass us by Fedl complicn.

Com. Sec. No: we argued that we cd. deal with S. Africa better if she stayed in the C‟wealth.

First Secy Rest of C‟wealth not entitled to teach us democracy. They are nearly all dictatorships themselves.

L. Ch. And they are unrealistic in assuming that S. Rh. is not indept already.

M.H. We must play for an adjournment until after dissoln confce. In S. Rh.‟s own interest since we shall be more free thereafter to deal with S. Rh. on merits. In initial stage, we shd. bid high, subject to avoiding a break: and then play for an adjournment.

Ch. Duchy I agree. Field, if confronted with exclusion from C‟wealth &amp; U.N., may be more flexible than we think.

Three forums of defence – Parlt: C‟wealth: U.N. Parlt may be easiest; but if price is dissoln of C‟wealth, that is too big a price to pay.

Ch. Secy I agree – even if it means that S. Rh. seizes indepce, with all the implicns for dissoln of Fedn. Unity of C‟wealth must be overriding considn. Shd. indepce coincide with dissoln of Fedn?

P.M. Yes: this is already a retreat from S. Rh.‟s original demand. “Agree” = “concede”.

M. Edn I agree with M. H. on tactics. Note refce to future links in draft statement. Must therefore play economic card with Field.

Unity of C‟wealth overriding. I agree with Ch. Secy. But avoid reaching this point for as long as possible: and play economic card.

M.T. Are altves as stark as suggested? What are min. terms that white C‟wealth wd. accept?

Com. Secy You can‟t ask Can. Govt to advise on „B‟ roll! But they will expect something wh. they can defend as reasonably democratic.

It is African C‟wealth members who wd. probably walk out on basis of anything acceptable to Field.

L.P. Even if it has seeds of future growth in it?

P.M. Future links may frighten S.Rh. Omit ? or substitute “and all that follows from it.” Amdt agreed.

P.M. Field &amp; Welensky may wish to avoid crisis as much as we do. Therefore tactics of playing for adjournment best. Avoid falling between both stools – i.e. alienating Field by insisting on fully repve govt or alienating rest of C‟wealth by leaving things as they are. Avoid also some compromise wh. might not suffice – at least until we can consider desirability of consulting rest of C‟wealth, especially black African members. And even that wd. involve more than Field wd. accept on first round. Therefore avoid premature commitment to any particular settlement.

First Secy We have repeatedly told U.N. that we have no power of intervention. Ultimately, we may have to concede indepce. F. Sec. agrees. I must have Cabinet‟s support. Was I wrong to invite F. to U.K.? F. may want to break: then we shall have trouble with our own Party.

M.W.P. Can we muzzle F. qua Press &amp; TV while he is here?

First Secy Will do our best.

Ch. Duchy And play to utmost with Party reluctance of rest of C‟wealth to accept

S. Rh. membership of C‟wealth with present constn. Many of our supporters wd. be v. surprised by this.

L. Ch. Same is true of white popn of S. Rh. itself.

P.M. Certainly right – and a triumph – to get F. to U.K. Our view of what is reasonable &amp; Field‟s view, however, may differ.

Com. Sec. At that point, we must face rest of C‟wealth with dilemma. We must consult them &amp; make them decide.

P.M. Avoid premature commitment – specific change of „A‟ roll or „B‟ roll or anything else. Let F. make the running with proposals.

Ch. Whip And let C‟wealth Secy begin educating our supporters (selected) about probable C‟wealth attitude.
