C.C. (63) 45 11 July 1963. 10.30 am.

1. Central Organisation for Defence C(63) 114.

[Enter Ch. Whip: F.L.A: S of S. War: S of S. Air:

M. Avn: C.D.S: F.S.L: C.I.G.S: C.A.S:

M.P.B.W.: M/S. C.R.O.

P.M. Part III explained as in brief.

F.S. Refer also to official Cttee?

P.M. Agree: on extra sentence or two.

M. Def. Much help from Service Ministers and C of S.

Publish 11 July: debate before recess: legislate in autumn: put into effect on 1/4/64.

Main principles:-

a) single integrated M. of Defence.

b) max. of devolution inside it.

c) indepce of Avn: don‟t overload Defence.

d) keep flexible.

e) .. balance of admve/military/scientific.

f) .. individual loyalties etc. of Services.

Ms. of State to be responsible for Services: but for anything else that

S of S. devolves. Chart shows lines of orgn &amp; responsy on all three sides of Dept. Note strengthening of C of S., Ch. Sc. &amp; P.U.S. Depts. in appropriate ways. Note four Acctg Officers: disappearance of Councils &amp; Boards: Queen to be Ld High Admiral.

F.S. Contact with political Depts. essential at all levels. Avoid Pentagon/State Dept. arrangement. Hence need for official cttee.

But para. 55 inadequate: and no F.O. or C.R.O. represn in paras. 35 &amp; 36.

M. Def. Agree in principle. But don‟t complicate unnecessarily at lower levels.

P.M. Yes: para. 35 concerned only with single military involvement.

F.S. But Defence Sectt (para. 55) and Planning Staff shd. have political advice - e.g. overflying rights.

M. Def. Normal interdeptl consultn shd. ensure this.

C.D.S. And political Depts. already fully brought in to C of S. deliberations.

F.S. But it doesn‟t work well.

P.M. Better after lessons learned at Jordan. Can still be improved: but don‟t spell it out too much.

L.P.S. But beware of growing power of new Dept. ? Make clear F.O. interest in para. 41.

P.M. Then make omnibus sentence (? in Section III) emphasising political Depts‟ participation in planning &amp; execution.

M.W.P. Paras. 91-92: ? emphasise for effectiveness of new orgn.

Ch. Duchy ? Omit: too defensive.

P.M. Agree.

Ministers of State to be Dy S.‟s of State? But don‟t limit S of S.‟s freedom to delegate as he wishes.

L.P. Effect on manning of Govt benches in Lords of abolishing 3 Ministers.

M. of S. not a substitute. Shd. be a full Minister.

P.M. Need something intermediate – like the Second Secretaries. ? Deputy Minister of Defence.

L. Ch. Or even just M. of Def., superior to M. of State for D.

L.P.S. Avoid pressure for Dy F.S. or Dy Ch. Exch. Re-establish M. of State‟s status.

Home Sec. We shall be forced to pay at least £5000.

M. Def. Avoid salary till Bill: and see how public opinion reacts.

Leave status as M. of State. Chart can‟t now be altered.

P.M. “Deputy” may be objectionable in principle: and constitutionally can you have a Dy S. of S. I agree with M. Def.: publish as is and see. But study powers.

M. Edn Para. 20. What about P.Q.‟s?

M. Def. Shd. be addressed to S. of S: but convention of appropriate M. of S. must be established firmly.

M.W.P. Para. 88 may be misinterpreted. Omit “for the S. of S.”

L. Ch. ? Omit altogether: and 89.

P.M. In 88 simply say separate Deptl secl arrangements will be integrated into a single Deptl organisation.

L.P.S. Para. 41. Amend to preserve posn of J.I.C.

Ch. Sec. Amdt to para 24 agreed.

F.S.L. Have explained to Navy, who will welcome it.

C.I.G.S. I agree.

C.A.S. I too – so long as professional Head of Service is preserved.

M. Lab. Are we safe in leaving Avn outside?

M. Def. I can defend it, from personal experience.

M. Avn Opposite course wd. be attacked by industry. And civil &amp; military

r &amp; d. and prodn can‟t be separated. And advantages in keeping c. avn in same place.

P.M. Great enterprise. Thanks to Service Ministers &amp; C. of S. Make it effective.

[Exeunt F.L.A: S of S. War: C.D.S:

F.S: C.I.G.S: C.A.S.

2. Foreign Office Building. C(63) 76.

M.P.B.W. Paras. 16-17. W.O. must now be available for M.Avn.

P.M. Agree to reconstruct F.O: but don‟t announce till autumn.

Style?

M.P.B.W. Settle by limited R.I.B.A. competn, including both tradl and modern architects.

P.M. Parliament? No.

M.T. Why a limited competn? Throw it open to anybody.

M.P.B.W. I will discuss with M.T., M.H.L.G., Com. Secy etc. form of limited competn and refer back to Cab.

F.S. Slippage of timetable – to ‟69 – v. serious. Two moves for many within 3 years. Bargain with M. Def. does. affect F.O: and we weren‟t told.

M.P.B.W. Not so.

Ch. Sec. Defer announcement: get Flemming announcement made separately.

[Exit M.P.B.W.

3. Parliament (oral).

Ch. Duchy As in Statement.

4. House of Lords Reform: Peerage Bil (oral).

[Enter Att. Gen. and Govt. Whip, Lords.

L. Ch. Pressure in Lords for effective on R.A. Must resist: but may lose.

Swinton‟s proposal to extend option to year more arguable.

Ch. Duchy Must oppose, even at risk of defeat. H/C. has settled this point and Lords ought not to reopen. Can‟t have a Wedgwood Benn Enabling Bill.

G.W. Lords Defeat certain. If so, accept Swinton‟s amdt? (He will withdraw it if R.A. amdt. fails.)

Ch. Duchy Beware of upsetting a package deal: 6 months was integral part.

P.M. Then persuade S to withdraw his proposal in Cttee, on basis that we will take it on Report if R.A. amdt. carried. If he refuses to withdraw, oppose as premature.

L.P. Yes. H/L. favours Swinton amdt: and package argument weaker for that reason.

P.M. If R.A. amdt. carried, what shd. Commons do?

Ch. Duchy Defer decision till it happens.

P.M. Agree. [Exeunt Att. Gen: Govt. Whip Lords.

5. Satellite Communications. C.(63) 117. [Enter P.M.G.

L.P.S. Believed policy agreed. Now challenged by Avn. Reconsider &amp; refer to P.M. on Monday.

[Exeunt P.M.G: M/S. C.R.O.

P.M. Agree.

6. Engineering Design: The Fielden Report. C(63) 118, 120 &amp; 124.

Ch. Exch. In spite of criticisms, must publish. But consider presentation and means of mitigating damage and preventing recurrence of this sort of thing. Best to publish before pending debate on science.

P.B.T. Will damage our exports, if quoted out of context. But agree must be published. Shd. never have happened.

L.P.S. Same was true of shipbuilding report, wh. we ought to have published. Since we must publish this one, let us use it.

L.P. I agree: an incentive to industry. It is a balanced document.

M.W.P. Avoid any official comment, wh. wd. indicate alarm. Publish to-morrow.

M. Avn Monday better: we can then concert attitude with S.B.A.C., who are criticised.

L.P. Folly to delay publicn. Widely known already.

M.T. V. damaging: but largely true and we must publish – for sake of long term benefits of changes wh. industry wdn‟t otherwise make.

M. Edn Para. 99 creditable to Govt. on educl grounds.

P.M. Must give industry reasonable chance to prepare defence. ? Publish on Thursday (2 days after Defence W.P.) and give both Press and industry adequate advance notice. M.W.P. to take charge of this, with D.S.I.R., in L.P.‟s absence in Moscow. If quoted in science debate on Monday, a bore.

7. Chalgrove Airfield. C(63) 116.

L. Ch. I have thought of a possible solution.

P.M. Discuss it at H.A. to-morrow.
