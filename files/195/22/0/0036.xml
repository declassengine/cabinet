C.C. (63) 36. 30 May 1963. 10.30 a.m.

1. Nato Nuclear Force. C(63) 95 &amp; 96. [Enter Ch. Whip.

F. Sec. Basic quns – i) how deal with new Germany? Bring into Nato and Europe as an ally or hold her down. We have chosen former.

ii) how prevent prolifn of nuclear weapons. No progress in disarmt confce: and France &amp; China make it unrealistic.

If no m-m force, what will G. do? Moderate Germans fear the worst if no alternative outlet: i.e. indept force or Franco-G. force.

If we stand aside, will force still be created? Yes. And if we stay outside we forfeit share of control.

U.S. may cheat on Polaris. But more likely if we stay outside.

Rest of Europe (exc. France) want us in.

If no force, Nato will demand M.R.B.M.‟s. But U.S. have said clearly that m-m force is altve to M.R.B.M.‟s.

U.S. will maintain unany rule, even if our contribn only 10%.

Provocation to Russia no greater: they won‟t arm China anyhow, because they don‟t trust them.

Not divisive of Nato unless Fr. veto. But they won‟t: as they didn‟t on multinational force.

Inconceivable we shd. not take part in examination of proposal by two main Nato nations, provided that other proposals are included.

M. Def. No military case. If U.S. retain veto, no addn to Western deterrent, since U.S. wd. not allow it to be fired unless S.A.C. were committed. Simply a means of making Europe pay for part of U.S.-controlled deterrent.

Therefore a political decision.

F. Sec. No: a military argt as well – to replace bombers when they fade out.

M. Def. Only if you accept U.S. view that this sort of war will be fought.

We don‟t.

If a political decision, real purpose is to contain Germany qua:-

a) mfctre: but this wd. mean breaking a Treaty – and releasing Allies from obligations (e.g. B.A.O.R. commitment).

b) acquire – e.g. from France. But Fr. have always denied they wd. do this.

U.S. view that m-m. force wd. contain Germany is opposite of truth: see von Hassell interview – wh. is on public record. How cd. we defend this to public opinion? Therefore warn U.S. of dangers of criticism both in France &amp; U.K.

Ch. Exch. This is going to happen: and we must be in it – at modest cost. But it is an addition to defence: and nothing is ever done to reduce it.

Com Secy I agree, qua strategy, with M. Def. S.A.C. by itself an adequate deterrent; and, if Unany rule persists, m-m force will be only small addn to U.S. deterrent – and less versimilitudinous because

use requires agreement not only of U.S. but also of other partners.

But politically v. dangerous to stay out. Fr. has contracted out of Nato; if we do too, alliance may disintegrate. In any case we shd. be bypassed on a good many Nato discussions &amp; decisions.

Choice shd. therefore depend on money involved: if not too great, go in.

L. Ch. V. doubtful about going in. Assumpn that U.S. will retain veto won‟t satisfy G. indefinitely: see v. H. interview. Must devise some other means of containing Nato.

L.P. No military value. Political value questionable. G. will recognise no military value: but it will give them training &amp; experience and they will use these to create their own deterrent.

Surface vessels are vulnerable; as first strike attack, they are also provocative. Folly to bring nuclear war nearer. Polaris is indestructible retaliation: m-m force is neither.

Ch. Duchy But m-m of a submarine is even greater military nonsense!

U.S. want both to contain Germany and to limit control over use of deterrent (as result of Cuba) – i.e. to get us out of it. S.U. v. afraid of G: more so if this goes through. U.K. also suspicious of G. intentions. How do we persuade public opinion, given that concept is military nonsense?

F. Sec. If so, SACEUR‟s present nuclear strike is nonsense. But it exists and will have to be replaced in due course.

M.A.F.F. Concept not necessy military nonsense: but m-m is, especially since it gives G. experience wh. they cdn‟t otherwise get. (For where wd. they test weapons?) Dangerous to whet G. appetite.

Therefore drag our feet and hope it will die.

Ch. Exch. But, if it happens anyway ……..?

L.P.S. Public opinion confused about deterrent; hence growth of abolitionism. European opinion also confused: expected us after Nasser to emphasise interdependence – but we have emphasised independence, as much as de Gaulle.

If we stay out, we alienate U.S., Germany and our friends in Europe. We shall play into de Gaulle‟s hands: and we shall be isolated.

France‟s object is to consolidate Six, on basis of Fr.-G. Treaty. If so, this means a Fr-G. arrangement about the deterrent.

Our strategy needs rethinking before we can dismiss project as military nonsense. U.S. think it is not: replacement for bombers must be found; and m-m was successful in air war of 1939-45.

A strong Europe is emerging: and won‟t accept U.S. &amp; U.K. veto.

Therefore we shd. go in, stipulating that change from unany rule must itself be by unanimous decision.

Important to educate Party opinion.

M.H. M-manning is a nonsense, invented for political end, wh. it cannot achieve. It won‟t satisfy G. public opinion. Why do something wh. is military nonsense for political purpose wh. will fail? Put this to U.S.

F. Sec. People most likely to succeed Adenauer believe that this wd. contain German aspirations. G. can‟t break unany rule unless U.S. &amp; U.K. agree.

M. Def. But G.‟s real intention is to get rid of it. They already have nuclear weapons in G.

Ch. Secy History confirms that it will whet G. appetite. And U.K. public opinion will take same view – and will expect Russians to as well. Costs of defence are already out of hand: how can we defend addl expenditure wh. can be questioned in terms of political &amp; military value?

Home Sec. It will retard cause of peace. But if it happens, we can‟t afford to be left out.

F. Sec. Italians, Greeks &amp; Turks will join.

M. Def. But only in order not to offend U.S. They wd. drop it if they cd.

M. Edn To try to kill it and to fail wd. leave us even weaker than before in terms of U.K./U.S. relations and in control of European policy.

P.B.T. Will force have military value or not? If not, it won‟t satisfy Germans for long. If it will, we ought to be in.

M. Def. It has – to U.S. as getting Europe to pay part of U.S. deterrent: and to G. for obvious reasons. But not to us.

F. Sec. But bombers of Nato must be replaced – either by M.R.B.M.‟s or by m-m force.

M. Def. But there is no real military requirement here for M.R.B.M.‟s. Bombers will be replaced by T.S.R. 2 and Polaris.

F. Sec. ? Ask U.S. to re-examine m-m submarines.

M. T. If we stay out, and it goes ahead ……?

F. Sec. Europe as a whole (incl. G.) wd. be disappointed.

If we stay out and find that we can‟t sustain our indept deterrent indefinitely, we get worst of all worlds.

Therefore at least examine as proposed in Annex II to C(63) 95.

L. P. Real technology now lies in missile rather than warhead; and missile has civil uses. ? Encourage U.S. &amp; G. to cooperate in devt of space missile systems, thus diverting attention from nuclear warhead.

L.P.S. But G. already a member of E.L.D.O. &amp; E.S.R.O. We must try to integrate G. in Europe; and Erhard &amp; Schroder will further this.

von Hassell insistence on majority voting is attempt to corral France, whose indept deterrent they can‟t accept (without having one of their own), whereas they can accept ours because of our world wide responsibilities.

M.A.F.F. But if we stand out, will Fr. or G. really develop indept deterrents? We found that we couldn‟t afford Blue Streak (i.e. a really modern delivery system).

P.M. I don‟t know whether it is a military nonsense or not. It may not be: U.S. don‟t think so. It must be considered further in terms of the ship‟s defence (? escorts) etc. in discussion with Ricketts. If we join, it is extra expdre. Also for Germans – who are in default on their B.A.O.R. contribn: and if they remain in default, we may not be able to keep 55000 men in Europe. Pressure to increase (or not reduce) our contl forces also relevant. Politically, can we maintain our own deterrent indefinitely? And, if we enter m.m. force, can we maintain our separate deterrent as well? And which way does argt about Germany point?

U.S. now disposed to less hurry. Tell them that Cab. have considered but are not ready to decide until Ricketts talks are over. Resume considn, after Whitsun, of major issues. Make clear to Prest K. before he starts on European tour in mid-June, that we are not committed. But keep open mind about technical feasibility of mixed manning; also about G. risk – it was economic collapse as much as military ambition that brought Hitler to power. Same pressures not present now.

2. Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (oral).

First Secy Avoid giving Field anything in writing. He will now consult his Cab. on practicability of constl advance as rapidly as possible after indepce. They are unlikely to concede anything; but I have pressed for widening of A. Roll franchise and increase in number of B. Roll seats, and future of non-discrimn. He may not be able to concede more than widening of B. Roll franchise. Old C‟wealth messages have shaken him a bit; but he won‟t attend dissoln confce without indepce. Nor will Fed. Govt. F. will then rely on Fedn remaining in being and on Welensky to help with troops etc.

I will reiterate our demands before he leaves. {Exit M.H.L.G.

L. Ch. On this basis, we shall have to legislate to remove Ny. &amp; N. Rh. out of Fedn, with arbitrary division of assets etc. A nonsense to leave Fedn consisting only of S. Rh. But better than unilateral attempt to dissolve Fedn.

Ch. Exch. Apportionment of Fedl debt v. awkward.

Com. Sec. Ditto for armed forces.

F. Sec. C‟wealth messages put demands v. high: universal suffrage etc.

First Secy Might carry them with decl of intention.

Com. Sec. Depends on substance. Widening of A. Roll franchise valueless if number of B. Roll seats unchanged. It is widening of A. Roll franchise which matters.

First Secy F. has no power of manoeuvre with his colleagues: but he does not want to break with U.K.

But a breakdown now seems unavoidable.

Ch. Duchy Even if we can get Field to accept something wh. public opinion in U.K. and old C‟wealth wd. endorse, new C‟wealth will remain. Try to leave things as they are – in sense of maintaining some link of dependence wh. wd. keep new C‟wealth at bay and give time for constl progress to take effect.

Com. Sec. But it won‟t keep new C‟wealth at bay. They will maintain pressure.

L. Ch. And impossible for Field to accept after his demand for indepce.

First Secy. In that case, dissoln confce will have to be cancelled as soon as F., after consultation with his Cabinet, rejects our demands.

L. Ch. No: go on with it, as gesture and as means of making arbitrary division of assets &amp; Debt.

L.P.S. ? Organize appeal to R.W. by old C‟wealth P.M.‟s.

First Secy R.W. now too committed to Field. [Exit L.P.

F. Sec. Press on A. Roll. ? Abandon B. Roll if necessary.

First Secy And if he agrees?

Com. Sec. Depends how much he gives. If we give up B. Roll, he may give more on A. Roll.

First Secy I will consult L. Ch. about Bill.

3. Local Government in Scotland (oral).

S of S. Scot. Scottish opinion in Party now satisfied – except on risk that reorgn might affect political balance. Investign has shown little in this. Therefore publish towards end of June.

P.M. Agree.

4. Tribunals of Enquiry (C(63) 9).

Home Secy As in memm. No enquiry: but don‟t invoke Act except in gravest cases.

Ch. Duchy Bank Rate, Waters &amp; Radcliffe tribunals have provoked discontent. Therefore H. Wilson, Bowden &amp; Grimond must be seen if there is no enquiry.

L. Ch. If you have an inquisitorial procedure, it must be inquisitorial.

P.M. Reconsider after Whitsun.

5. Railway Fares: London (oral).

M.T. Proposal by both L.T.Bd &amp; B. Rlys. is to increase fares (as from 23 June) and justify to Tribunal afterwards. Increases only over 4 miles and to taper off at 30 miles to existing rates at 40 miles.

Wider applicn – instead of concentration – wd. be difficult especially for London buses, where bulk of takings are in 3d to 1/- range. And to modify 3d fare wd. be difficult to persuade Tribunal to accept.

P.M. But concentration on suburbs politically unjustifiable – “unfair”.

Ch. Duchy I agree: it hits the “Orpington man” and discriminates against him and in favour of “outer circle”.

Ch. Sec. And it is Orpington belt wh. Tribunal was established to protect!

P.M. Ch. Exch. &amp; Ministers concerned shd. re-examine to-day.

6. Air Ministry Computers C(63) 93 and 98.

[Enter S of S. Air &amp; Parly Sec. M. Avn

Ch. Secy As in memm.

S of S. Air We want the computers, for reasons of efficiency &amp; economy.

P.M. ? Unwise to sue A.E.I.

F. Sec. We must encourage our own industry.

P.B.T. Ratio of purchases is 62 U.K. to 4 U.S. One more U.S. won‟t matter. If we deliberately switch order to U.K., it shows weakness.

M.T. If tenders are selective, unethical to reject lowest.

P.M. Let this go to R.R: but try to allot second one to A.E.I. and avoid litigation even at cost of delay.

Parly Sec. A.E.I. computer won‟t work.

Avn

L.P.S. But don‟t publicise this: Germans on point of placing large computer orders here.

P.M. Let possibility of getting A.E.I. one put right be explored.

7. Export of Arms to S. Africa (oral).

Home Sec. As in my minute. Press U.S. for answer to our enquiry on L/L. aspect.

M. Def. And renew pressure on S. Africa to withdraw demand, wh. embarrasses us.

Ch. Sec. But we gave them some last year.

F. Sec. I will speak to S.A. Ambassador again. No decision till I have done so.
