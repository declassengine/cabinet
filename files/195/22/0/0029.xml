C.C. (63) 29. 9 May 1963. 10.a.m.

1. Industrial Disputes: Railways (oral). [Enter M. Power.

M.T. N.U.R. anxious to avoid strike. But mustn‟t let them appear to win. 1st point accepted by N.U.R: 2-5th points are negotiable: 6th point is crux. If this alone survived, it wd. ????? heartless to refuse to compromise.

M. Lab. But dangerous for other industries. Shorter period &amp; larger lump sum payment better.

Ch. Duchy. It means also that it pays to strike: A.S.L.E.F. &amp; T.S.S.A. have not threatened a strike. Why yield to N.U.R. under duress.

L. Ch. Even points 2-5 are a surrender. Point 6 (if conceded without refce. to length of service) wholly indefensible. Better to keep lines open – and satisfy public at same time.

Ch. Exch. But can we be tougher than Beeching?

L.P. No: must let him play the hand: and to our political advantage to buy support for B. plan without bitterness of strike.

M.T. And not much money in it.

Ch. Sec. And we have already pressed B. to be generous in principle, in context of Redundancy Agreement.

P.M. B. shd. be ready to negotiate – and to settle with all 3 Unions – but not under duress. And on broad grounds, not on narrow point of over 60‟s.

M.T. Don‟t jeopardise advance achieved – i.e. Unions have abandoned oppn to whole plan and are now only fighting redundancy &amp; resettlement provisions. I will work out formula with M.W.P., based on P.M.‟s indications, pointing to resumption of normal negotns through ordinary machinery, (but making it clear on which points B. can‟t give way). Formula approved.

[Exeunt M.T., M.W.P., M. Power.

2. Parliament (oral).

Ch. Duchy. As in Statement. [Exit Ch. Duchy.

3. Foreign Affairs (oral).

(a) U.A.R.

F. Sec. C.E.N.T.O. believes purposes of Fedn are aggressive. But internal struggle (B.V.N.) in Iraq &amp; revival of Kurdish trouble may frustrate it. (Shah agrees our supply of arms to Iraq.) Some internal division in Syria, where Nasserites may seize Govt.

Posn in Jordan v. tricky. U.K.-U.S. discussns on contingency planning, wh. will vary according to whether King is o‟thrown by internal revolt (we cd. not intervene) or by external threat (when we might intervene to hold the ring pending U.N. action). But intervn wd. be difficult qua o‟flying Israel. May not happen since Arabs may fear to provoke Israel.

Ch. Sec. Arms for Iraq: accelerate or at normal pace?

F. Sec. Probably accelerate a bit: but depends whether N. or B. win and this shd. be clear before we begin to supply on large scale.

Com. Sec. Beware of interventn. Last time we were lucky to get in – and to get out, both politically &amp; militarily.

F. Sec. I agree. We can‟t intervene to keep Israelis out of Left Bank or to save King from internal threat. External threat is only problem.

P.M. Israel unlikely this time to let us o‟fly. This time U.S. must make the running – particularly if entry has to be by S.A.

b) Cameroon Bananas. [Enter Parly. Sec. B/T.

F. Sec. C. export 80,000 tons of bananas to U.K. (with benefit of I. Prefce.) each year. Since we failed to enter E.E.C., W. C. will not get E.E.C. Prefce. If we also cut off I. Prefce., 40% of trade goes. President has asked for one year‟s extension.

C. Sec. But C. voted themselves out of C‟wealth. If they can‟t compete with W. Indies without I. Prefce., that is their fault. W.I. wd. oppose this proposal. Only 1d a lb. involved: not much at stake.

F.O. originally agreed not to pursue the idea: President‟s visit not an excuse to reverse course. I.P. lasts till Sept. anyhow: therefore at least.

Parly Sec. End of I.P. wont really hurt C: only ¾d a lb. Also no quota restriction. Free entry plus modest tariff puts them at advantage compared with S. American exporters, who face quotas and high tariff.

P.M. Can‟t decide now: but reconsider in relation to proposed loan for devt. Don‟t make a loan &amp; deny C. the means of servicing it. F.O., C.R.O., Tsy., B/T. to prepare a memm on policy, including C. prefce. for our exports.

c) Br. Guiana.

Com. Sec. State of Emergency may have to be declared. Troops alerted.

4. Federation of Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland. C(63) 78.

First Sec. As in memm, Fedl Govt. may resent, but have accepted sitn.

L. Ch. But is liquidn of Fedn to be voluntary or compulsive? Bill must be v. broad enabling measure. Provision for future links may suggest to S. Rh. that we shall impose links. Better to let them make links or not after separation.

First Secy Decide at last minute.

L.P. O-in-C. must be subject to Aft. Resn.

First Secy Yes: tho‟ v. awkward if Parlt. not sitting.

P.M. Let Bill be drafted. Can we enact it before recess? And consultn on terms?

Ch. Whip. Only if we have first settled S. Rh.

First Secy Can‟t resist consultn – but not at this stage.

On timing, trouble with Ny. unless we have legislated for her secession by August.

L. Ch. But that raises issue of future of N. &amp; S. Rh. Best to ignore this.

Ch. Whip Can‟t ignore it, since S. Rh. has claimed indepce simultaneously with secession of Ny.

L. Ch. Legislate for Ny. alone? Much easier in H/L.

First Secy No: not two bites at the cherry. But no agreement with S. Rh. unless we modify our policy.

And to deal with Ny. alone wd. provoke demand from N. Rh. for legislation for her secession.

P.M. S. Rh. a great dilemma. But we can‟t rise for summer with no power to cope with sitn.

Therefore authorise drafting of Bill (with A. Resn on O-in-C.). Reconsider when Field‟s reply available.

[Re-enter Ch. Duchy: M/T: M.W.P.

5. Anglo-Greek Relations (oral).

F. Sec. Gk. Govt. want public expression of value wh. we attach to A-Gk. alliance. Otherwise Gk. Oppn may force cancellation of Royal Visit.

Ch. Duchy More harm than good in Commons.

F. Sec. I will inspire a Qn in Lords.

P.M. Be careful: don‟t start a new row.

Ch. Duchy There will be Communist demonstrations during Visit.

F.Sec. Defer till Monday: hope Visit not cancelled before then.

P.M. Gk. Govt.‟s request for “categorical assurance” that we dissociate ourselves from demonstrations is insulting &amp; shd. be rejected. But moderate statement in Lords about A-Gk. relations wd. do no harm. Must avoid cancellation of Visit if possible.

F. Sec. I will do so. [Exit Parly Sec. B/T.

6. Government Offices: The Foreign Office Building C(63) 76.

[Enter M.P.B.W.

P.M. Choice between a) gutting &amp; modernising: expensive &amp; unsatisfactory. £2 m.

b) rebuilding: £7 m. – but more economic.

But a modern or a conventional building?

Com. Sec. Defer demolition (not till ‟68 anyhow) until we see what proposals &amp; designs are put forward. Two stage competn a good idea; but first stage shd. be open to all. Force R.I.B.A. to change rules.

M.W.P. I agree.

M.P.B.W. But best people, who are busy anyhow, may be discouraged by general competn. Six leading architects is a fair field: and wd. break R.I.B.A. rules.

P.M. Parlt will be v. interested: must face a debate.

M.P.B.W. But don‟t delay decision – by wide competn – since so much of planning of accmn hangs on this.

Ch. Sec. And get cost in right year (as M.P.B.W. proposes) to avoid public criticism. (Victoria St rent will be even higher than indicated.)

P.M. Even so, get V. St bldg. at higher rent.

Ch. Sec. Defer announcement till Flemming Report available, as offset.

L. Ch. Great oppn to demolition: view from Park etc.

Ch. Sec. But altve v. uneconomic.

P.M. Demolition right – if new bldg. is a good bldg.

Ch. Duchy To change announced plan of modernisation bad. To propose £7 m. (wh. cd. be devoted to schools etc.) politically worse.

Ch. Exch. I agree. The £7 m. will be greatly exceeded: cf. Downing St. reconstruction.

P.M. Defer decision. Ponder. [Exit M.P.B.W: M. Transt.

7. Disarmament. C(63) 79.

F. Sec. As in memm. K.‟s reply on tests v. discouraging. This increases importance of new initiative at Geneva. Modesty of proposal is an attraction – a gradual downturn of curve. Russians unlikely to accept: and we shan‟t show our hand in detail until they &amp; U.S. show theirs.

M. Def. Disarmt is not achieved by destruction. It‟s what you keep that matters: and Russians will never accept inspection on this. Russia &amp; U.S.A. cd. scrap a lot without noticing it: we can‟t &amp; shd. have to drop out of the game pretty soon.

Write off of £2 m. (on F.O. vote) wd. involve repurchasing a lot of equipment of a type wh. we are currently making. Note: we have no obsolete tanks.

Ch. Exch. Ridiculous to scrap a few bombers when we are making nuclear weapons.

P.M. Dilemma: how keep up momentum of Geneva ( and avoid U.N. debate) without exposing ourselves to these difficulties.

Destruction of weapons, while production continues, hypocritical and adds nothing to security. Policing measures different: and limit our new initiative to these.

F. Sec. These alone wd. not be a new initiative. Destruction would be – and might be a psychological first step.

P.M. Towards stripping us completely? We can‟t afford to discard much: U.S. &amp; Russia can.

Can we keep Geneva going somehow until we have considered K.‟s reply?

F. Sec. A woolly speech by our Spokesman, designed to ensure that, if confce goes into recess, it will reassemble later?

P.M. Agree. Avoid a memm: leave it to a general speech discussing possibilities for discussion after reassembly. Latter is our real objective. [Exit F. Sec.

8. Local Government in Scotland C (63) 74

S. of S.S. As in memm. My examn is known in Scotland wh. has welcomed “new look” in principle. Consultn will take a year: no legn in this Parlt and little publicity until plan agreed.

? Repercussion in England. But procedures different: and scale of local problems different. Small burghs. may oppose: but they represent v. small proportion of total and some will gain in status.

Ch. Duchy. Agree proposals will be supported in principle (at this stage) in Scotland. But make sure of our own people in the House. We can‟t risk political trouble on this issue.

P.M. A purely political issue. Do we lose or gain by publishing W. P. at this stage in Parlt. Discuss frankly with Scot. Unionist members.

If they agree, then decide when to publish.

S. of S.S. I will do so. Industrialists wd. certainly welcome reorgn.

P.M. But defer consultn with L.A.‟s until after election? Publish towards end of summer and see how opinion reacts. Keep in touch with Ch. Duchy.

9. House of Lords Reform C (63) 77.

P.M. Accept minor points of machinery, subject to informing Oppn.

On substantial points:- a) accept: but can‟t legislate on courtesy titles.

Ch. Duchy. Maybe: but Socialist opinion strong on this.

M.H. Irrelevant, still son can stand for Parlt, as it is, without surrendering.

Ch. Duchy. But important qua H/C – where we shd. try to establish new convention avoiding courtesy titles.

P.M. On (c), accept?

L.P. It‟s wrong: but we must accept Cttee‟s view. (A restriction on Preogative).

P.M. On (d), we can‟t make an exception for Longford.

L.P. Yes.

L.Ch. A minor who succeeds: shd. he have to settle within a year of majority?

L.P. Yes. Cttee said so: and he is eligible to stand for Commons at 21.

It is too young: but we can‟ take account of it.

P.M. On (b)? What about N.I. ?

L.P. We can‟t accept, in relation to N.I. a peerage relating to whole of Ireland.

Must meet any difficulty by converting into a U.K. peerage.

P.M. Extinction or life extinction? This is where battle will be: we shd. stick to life extinction.

In short we adhere to Cttee.

M.H. V. unfortunate: it will undermine H/L. by discouraging people from accepting implied membership of that House and will therefore weaken links between two Houses.

L.P. I agree. But no altve.

P.M. Date of introdn of Bill? As soon as possible.

Ch. Duchy. Will be taken as a pointer to election.

P.M. Must accept that. Legislate this session.

L.P. Consult Lords Whip on effect on programme in Lords.

P.M. Clarify last para of draft statement.
