C.C. (63) 37 12th June, 1963 10.am

1. Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip.

F.M. Field will now accept dissoln confce.

First Secy. Yes: but Cab. divided on constl progress and on participn in dissoln confce. Cannot be sure until we have his reply, to-day or to-morrow. Meanwhile I am going ahead – to secure agreed agenda etc. – on basis of 24 June. May I do so (if reply is simple acceptance) and publish correspce on 18 June? It leaves our suggestions for reform open without committing us to any course wh. might alienate either white or black C‟wealth. Menzies increasingly insisting on constl advance.

2. Resignation of S. of S. for War (oral).

P.M. None of political vicissitudes has shaken me personally as much as this sickening episode.

Facts. Hollis warned N.B. in Aug. ‟61 of P-Ward - Iv link. N.B. warned P. Neither H nor N.B. knew about C.K. at that date: otherwise, they would have taken risk of blackmail more seriously. N.B. did not mention it to me at the time.

I did not hear of Ward until Feby incident this year, when I asked Ch. Whip to see P. P stuck to his story in discussions with Ch. Whip, Att. Gen. and Leader of House. He admitted that N.B. had warned him (and may have assumed that more was known than in fact was) and maintained that he ended the assocn at once. My own conscience was sensitive because I had forced resign on Galbraith.

I did not want to do same to P. without evidence. His personal statement seemed finally to dispose of doubts, especially threat of libel action (which he later implemented).

When P. confessed and H. Wilson pressed for enquiry, I asked L.Ch. to consider whether prima facie case of security risk. His report now available. Better not to publish but to show to H. Wilson and then under new procedure, discuss with P. Councillors and then, if necessary, implement that procedure.

My own position in 1961 now clear: but I am in Cabinet‟s hands and will do what they wish.

L.P. The public have been given only Ward‟s story, which calls in question not only our judgement but also our honesty.

It is believed that S. S. knew about the girl in ‟61; and that those who drafted the personal statement knew about the letter from P. to C.K., wh. was inconsistent with his innocence. L. Ch‟s report disposes of first allegn: second is more intelligible if interview came at end of several discussions.

But we must make our concern clear: we have kept silent too long.

L.Ch. I have confined myself to security. Para 23 now based on report by F.O. I have not been able to discuss it with Ch. Duchy. I will reword it after checking with him.

No foundation for rumour, wh. Ward has spread, that Govt. knew in 1961 that P-C.K. liaison existed then. Nor are there any grounds for supposing that letter, admitted by P on 4 Feb ‟63, could have cast doubt on his disavowal of liaison with C.K. That disavowal convinced his own solicitor and both Law Officers. Even if the letter had been available then. it would not have prevailed against this. It was only later, when strenuous efforts to recover letter became known, that serious doubts arose.

We may have been wrong to accept P‟s statement: but we can - and must – show that we did so in good faith. The letter was not seen by any member of Govt. until I got it from P‟s solicitors when I saw him last Friday.

30 Jan incident. It came to attention of M.I.5. on 29 May M.I.5. told Bligh something to some effect. But not the same.

M. Def. Does it strengthen allegation that P.M. did not know but ought to have known or knew but concealed it?

Com. Sec. Para 26. Rumoured that P. was in flat at that time.

Att. Gen. It was more than a year later than termination of assocn.

P.M. We must avoid any statement based on unsupported statement by P.

Ch. Exch. Will new facts emerge during Ward‟s trial?

L.Ch. I can‟t say. Have limited myself to security and have not seen Ward‟s other contacts.

Att. Gen. I have been through D.P.P.‟s list of names: nobody apart from Astor and P. are mentioned. But no guarantee.

Com. Sec. L.Ch. has not seen Ward or C.K.

L. Ch. I could not rely on what they said. And Ward is sub judice.

F.S. Good faith matters more than good judgement. We can disprove both allegations on good faith.

M.A.F.F. S. Pictorial say they had letter in January. Their interviews with P. extended from 4 Feb to 21 March. Can it be shown that anybody else, e.g. Oppn, had seen it in that interval? If so, v. damaging to us.

L.Ch. Ward saw Wigg on 26 March and said letter was innocuous. This informn did not reach Govt. until 9 April, in HW‟s letter to P.M.

(wh. he had delayed sending for a month). But we can‟t assume that no copy of it was available to Oppn.

L.P. If it was, and was not passed to Govt., Oppn very culpable.

M.H. V. difficult to convince H/C. that we accepted pers. statement in good faith. It was not convincing in itself: and when it is known that from 4 Feb a letter was admitted to exist, and might be presumed to be in affectionate terms, and that there was also a gift, it becomes almost inconceivable that we endorsed the pers. statement in good faith. Did anybody on night of 21 March ask for the letter?

Ch. Duchy. Yes. We put it to him that he must have in mind the letter wh. he had admitted but we had not seen. He took the point and we believed him.

M. H. But if he agreed that letter was designed to extricate him from a social engagement with C.K. the fact of the engagement is inconsistent with the statement.

Att.Gen. No: the letter was designed to end the assocn, via the engagement.

L.Ch. He also admitted on 4 Feb that he had given C.K. a small present.

P.M. Posn of Ch. Whip and myself is that we tried to help P. to kill the rumours. Perhaps we were credulous: but we acted in good faith. His willingness to bring an action – and actually bring one, successfully – clinched it in my mind.

M.A.F.F. On the Thursday evening, at a dinner of Other Club, P was v. shaken. He told me there was no question of adultery: but he thought of resigning on grounds of unwise behaviour. He saw Ch. Whip later that evening. Wigg made his statement in between.

Ch. Duchy. Para 23. – totally untrue, that I or my family had any connection with Ward. Read my letter to F. Sec. a few days later.

L. Ch. I will put this right.

Ch. Duchy. Americans are concerned only with security aspect. Kennedy said that Callaghan had told him that he believed P‟s statement.

On the Thursday evening (2.am Friday), P. said he had not seen C.K. since Dec. ‟61 (now shown to be Aug ‟61); he had only seen Ivanov only for a moment at a social gathering. This was more important to us than allegations of impropriety. Fact that letter was known and was in possession of Press made it more – not less – reasonable for us to take his word. His subsequent recantation came as a complete shock to us.

Com. Sec. Did P. offer to resign?

Ch. Whip. No: I told him that, if rumours were true, he must resign. But he had already disavowed rumours.

L.P. We must clear up episode of M. Lab‟s car, wh. he denied to Wigg that he had lent to P. and subsequently remembered he had. But he has now corrected this to Wigg.

L.Ch. Therefore we need not refer to it further.

M.H. The letter and the present remain awkward in relation to pers. statement.

Att. Gen. I did not know then that letter had already been recovered. I thought that C.K. still had it and intended to use it as basis of libellous press article.

I knew about the present.

M.W.P. Earlier that day three members of Press had mentioned letter to me.

Therefore, when P. said it was innocent, I was relieved, not alarmed; the more so since Press themselves thought there was nothing in it.

Home Sec. We shall be asked if we questioned P. again after W. came to see Bligh.

P.M. I agreed to that interview. W. merely complained about police investign and offered to conceal P. gossip in return for police being called off. I disregarded this attempt at blackmail.

L. Ch. And he gave no facts, beyond alleging relationship more intimate than was supposed.

M. Edn. Crucial fact is judgment of those present at interview on 21/22 March. Difficult to maintain that they were wise in light of letter.

P.M. But assocn lasted only five weeks.

L.P. We needn‟t believe that.

Ch. Duchy. After all, he saw her again - ? – in December.

P.M. I am going to defend my honour and honour of Cabinet. I may have been credulous: but I acted in good faith and resolved, particularly after Galbraith episode, to stand by a Minister whom I believed to be telling the truth.

Att. Gen. P. admitted to having been alone with C.K. only twice, watching television.

L.P. If I had known that, I wd. have hesitated to allow an assertion of innocence to be inserted in pers. statement.

L.Ch. We must make it clear that statement was drafted by P. and solicitor alone.

L.P. No: we saw the statement in advance and therefore accepted it.

P.M. Respony is mine: and I shall carry it.

I ought to have dismissed him; but I could not reconcile this with the pers. statement.

I shall send report to Wilson: and then institute new procedure. But no publicn of report.

First Secy. An enquiry essential.

L.P.S. Are Cabinet united on issue of good faith.

P.M. I hope so.

Generally agreed.

M.H. I do not question good faith. But I still question judgment.

P.M. If so, fault is mine: and I shall be at Cabinet‟s disposal.
