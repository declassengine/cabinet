C.C. (63) 42 25 June 1963. 10.30 a.m.

1. Peerages Bill (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip

P.M. Effective on Dissoln or R. Assent?

Ch. Duchy Hitherto assumed Dissoln. R. Assent wd. mean:-

a) altering rules during game: don‟t alter composn during a Parlt.

b) Sinclair, on petition from W. Benn, has said that, if on R.A., he must make way for W. Benn. V. difficult – and not quotable in public.

? Accept: and accept W. Benn without a fight.

L.P. And peeresses and Scots peers wd. come in, altering character of H/L. during a Parlt. Wd. also embarrass me personally.

L. Ch. H/L. wd. object for these reasons.

Ch. Whip But Lords Ch. Whip in favour!

L.P. He hadn‟t consulted me. Lords wd. object to adjustment of their composition during a Parlt.

Home Sec. I agree. Any major change shd. be at a Dissoln.

Ch. Duchy I agree: but we might be beaten, wh. wd. be v. awkward at this moment.

Let us take soundings in both Houses and reconsider on Thursday.

2. Nato Nuclear Force: Mixed Manned Component. C(63) 103.

[Enter F.L.B: M. Avn: C.D.S: F.S.L.

M. Def. Two military doubts: a) Can Polaris be used in surface ships?

Yes. Submarines better: but surface ships wd. work, and are better than submarines for mixed manning.

U.S. may have underestimated Russian reaction – enlargement of sub. fleet etc. But even allowing for this, scheme wd. work.

b) Do ships add to defence of West? No: they are superfluous. U.S. agree must be subject to veto (otherwise we shd. have no part in it) and wd. therefore never be used unless main U.S. deterrent was used. And this is more than adequate already. Macnamara admits this.

Cost to West wd. be very heavy: conventional capacity wd. be bound to suffer.

European support for project waning. And clear that many German soldiers regard this as way in to deterrent, not way out.

How deal with U.S.? They have proposed 2 N.A.T.O. studies – strategic purposes and force goals. These shd. demonstrate no

military requirement for m-m. force and harmful effect on conventional forces.

U.S. motives mixed: partly genuine desire to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons but also desire to find outlet for surplus fissile material.

C.D.S. Last week‟s discussions (top level) at N.A.T.O. No German support for it there. In military Cttee., U.S. argued for long war – in which m-m. force might be relevant. But long war – whether nuclear or conventional – is nonsense. Most N.A.T.O. countries support us on this: apart from Germans (for wrong reasons), nobody wants m-m. force. Defence Budget ought not to suffer for this.

F.S.L. U.S. admit no European navy supports this. It wd. work, but a second best to subs. or fixed land sites. Manpower must be skilled – and therefore difficult for any navy to spare. (Cd. not depend on volunteers.) Our 10% wd. mean 1000 officers and man, whom we could ill spare.

Two bases – Med. and Europe. (? next door to Holy Loch.)

Command to be international, with international flag. ? International M/Defence, code of discipline etc. – all of wh. wd. have to be invented.

M. Def. Not a N.A.T.O. force: a force owned and managed by subscribers, wh. they wd. assign to N.A.T.O. Thereafter, it wd. be subject to ordinary N.A.T.O. controls, including normal U.S. veto on use. But U.S. have hinted to Germans that veto might gradually be eased out.

Com. Sec. If U.S. have technical, as well as admn veto, missiles cd. be fired without consent of other subscribers?

L. Ch. How transfer naval personnel subject to Naval Discipline Act to discipline of a separate authority?

F.S.L. U.S. not clear.

If Russians resent this new force, there may be trouble.

Provision of (? national) escort force unclear; but in time of tension it wd. have to be provided – at expense of our own resources.

F.L.A. The 1000 men – of whom 10% wd. have to be v. highly skilled – cd. only be provided by paying off 25% of our escort strength.

C.D.S. M-m. of Subs. v. dangerous. (see Thresher.) I therefore persuaded Kennedy that surface ships were safer.

F. Sec. Congressional reasons also influenced him.

M.R.B.M.‟s, especially on German soil, now agreed to be undesirable. Therefore emphasis must be on naval delivery systems, of some

kind. Otherwise, U.S. will revive M.R.B.M.‟s as replacement of bombers.

M. Def. T.S.R.2. will do this, until at least 1975. Anyway, this is question for N.A.T.O. studies.

[Exeunt F.L.A.: C.D.S: F.S.L.

F. Sec. Germans now bound either to press for removal of restrictions on their mfre of nuclear weapons or to go in with French. Even if U.S. are now beginning to resile from m-m. project in private, this is not their public posn – see yesterday‟s communiqué of Kennedy-Adenaner talks, wh. is meant to put us in a spot. Adenaner‟s successors did not look on this as a way in: they regard it as a way of diverting the demand. Therefore strong political reason for supporting project: and no real altve. I support Altve B: and put Dec. next year as term of enquiry, using interval to examine other possible means of delivery and to explore composn of controlling body.

L.P.S. Are technical objections really impartial? Or do they reflect in-built prejudice?

Addn to Defence Budget not large: difficult to convince Europe that we can‟t afford it.

Legal problems cd. surely be overcome.

On other hand, Europe support project politically: if we don‟t we shall lose German sympathy, encourage Fr.-German link-up, and make Fr.-G. entity main point of U.S. contact with Europe. Can we take some initiative of our own – a Eur. defence effort without U.S. veto (and excluding France, if necessary)? This wd. not be m-m: and wd. be airborne.

F. Sec. French wd. not come into any orgn where we had a veto. And they wd. greatly dislike G. to become a nuclear power.

Russian reaction bound to be adverse, tho‟ its form unpredictable. Tension would be increased: and pending discussions with S.U. about test ban and non-dissemn agt might well be prejudiced.

L.P. Surely Kennedy sees this? Future of cold war turns on conventional weapons and political weapons: U.S. accepted this a short time ago – why have they changed?

Ch. Duchy During my recent visit to U.S., I got impression that U.S. Govt. now convinced of its value and are determined to go ahead. Reason is that there is no real altve. M.R.B.M.‟s on German soil or Fr.-G. agt to develop a nuclear force wd. be more provocative than this.

First Secy Qua Germany, we shd. go cautiously ahead with this, rather than reject it. Therefore adopt Altve B. rather than A. (wh. might shut us out) – but stipulate no decision until N.A.T.O. studies complete.

[Exit First Secy – for Africa!

Ch. Exch. Cost heavy, and bound to rise. But consider all o‟seas expdre together – military, political, aid etc. On that basis, diversion of G. from nuclear weapons must have v. high priority. But will it succeed? G. will regard it as a way in; and Russian reaction is bound to increase tension. Therefore I support Altve A: but, if so, will U.S. go ahead without us or will they blame us for wrecking it? And wd. either be a bad thing?

F. Sec. U.S. will probably go ahead with G: and Italy, Benelux etc. will support them. But if they drop it and blame us, we shall be responsible in German eyes, with all that this wd. entail.

M. Avn If we join the study, it will be unpopular with Br. industry, as ruling out e.g. space projects wh. wd. be more valuable in promoting European spirit.

Com. Sec. A military nonsense. But no political altve if we are to prevent G. from joining France or going it alone. And, if project is going ahead, whether we support it or not, we had better be in on it and avoid being wrong with everybody.

P.B.T. But if a military nonsense, why shd. it satisfy G? Put this to Kennedy.

S of S. Scot. We can‟t sell this to public opinion, if military opinion is against it. If it is coming anyway, we shd. be seen to stand aside.

M.W.P. This is not decisive. More important is doubt about its value as a disincentive to G. and its effect on Russia – i.e. failure of test ban etc.

M.H. I agree. Lack of altve to unsound course not a reason for embracing unsound course. M-m. force will not deter Fr. f. de frappe. Therefore start with Altve A., but be willing to explore implications in order to give time for realities to sink in. But avoid any formal working group.

M.A.F.F. Don‟t touch it, unless essential. Militarily valueless: provocative to Russia: and politically difficult to sell in U.K. – unless we can convince public opinion that it is only way – and an effective way – of deterring G. But will G. be content to remain on a par with Greece &amp; Turkey? And, if they know that their possession of nuclear weapons wd. be a casus belli, will they really want them? No sign at present: and therefore we can‟t – yet – argue that there is no altve on this score. Therefore adopt Altve A. and stipulate no further action until G. demand becomes real.

M.T. To stay out worse than to go in – because we shall lose another (perhaps last) chance of getting into Europe. Therefore be ready to move from A. to B.

M.H.L.G. It must prejudice test ban treaty. And I agree with M.A.F.F. premature qua G. Therefore adopt A. but offer to discuss joint nuclear arrangement with Five.

L. Ch. I agree with M.A.F.F. An expensive nonsense, not justified by need to contain G: avoid any examn implying commitment.

Chief Secy If we examine, we are committed. It wd. prejudice Russian relations; and, qua G., face issue now while they still have not got nuclear weapons.

Wanton folly to spend money on a military nonsense when we may have to cut Defence Budget anyhow.

Indefensible to public opinion.

M. Lab. I agree with M.H.

M. Edn We may have to be ready to exercise our influence – as we should – in a context not of our choosing. Therefore Altve A. may not be enough: we ought to go a bit further, stopping short of B. if possible, but going there, if necy.

Home Sec. I agree with M.H. – particularly in light of risk to test ban treaty and certain increase in tension. Don‟t go much further than A. That is not enough: therefore follow up L.P.S.‟s suggn of a new initiative by ourselves.

L.P.S. a) No logical connection between test ban and this project. As Russians say, test ban has no effect on disarmt.

b) We refused to abandon our deterrent. If we refuse it to others, we are seen to be hypocrites unless we find some other means of satisfying G. aspirations – wh. are not nationalist but internationalist.

P.M. Reflect: resume Thursday.

Test ban is our biggest prize. Hitherto denied us by political pressures in U.S. But Kennedy now keen on it. This puts us in dilemma qua m-m. force. Therefore seek to delay decision, either on military or on political grounds. G. beginning to realise cost: might prefer some altve on lines of multinational force [?] or some genuinely European scheme. Beware of acting mainly from annoyance with de G. We must aim at Altve A., without appearing merely to contract out and wreck the Scheme. This Parlt wd. not vote for this project. Next Parlt?? G.‟s real intentions will be determined, as always, not by politicians but by generals. Be careful. Genuinely Eurn soln is the only safe course. Intentions of Fr. also uncertain: wd. de G. dare to give G. nuclear weapons?

Technical objns less decisive: but must be taken into account.

Russians bound to react somehow. Therefore wiser to concentrate on test ban and non-dissemn agt. That is main point – wh. I must emphasise to Kennedy.
