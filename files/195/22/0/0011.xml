C.C.(63)11 14th February 1963. 10.30 a.m.

[Enter Ch. Whip.

1. Parliament. (oral).

Ch. Duchy. As in statement.

L.P. Oppn. Motion on unemptt. in Lords next week. Tactics?

L.Ch. Table amdt.

F.Sec. Agree.

P.M. Agree.

2. Malta : Dockyard (oral).

Com.Sec. Baileys v. evasive. We must go ahead. I have agreed with P.M. of Malta that they will legislate for council of Admn.

L.Ch. With same powers as we hoped to get by agt. or with lesser powers.

Former v. drastic by legn.

Com. Sec. We shall take powers to retransfer to B. unnecy. powers. But it is for Malta Govt. to decide.

L.Ch. Better merely to give future money to C. of A : to take over B.‟s own money v. doubtful.

Com. Sec. But then none of existing money wd. be saved. Horse wd. bolt before stable locked. Little money left, in view of debts : but assets considerable.

L.Ch. But can we really operate their o/c and charge their assests?

To freeze both reasonable : to operate them not. We must put up new money for current wages etc.

Ch.Exch. Let Govt. of Malta – who will pass legn. and appoint C. of A. – decide for themselves.

P.M. Publicn. of accountants‟ report will swing sympathy against B.s. and emphasise importance of local empt. On this basis, leave as it is. It is a Maltese Co. : and Malta Govt. must decide.

M.A.F.F. Watch criticism of Govt. for original appt. of B.

Ch.Duchy. But nobody else wd. take it on.

M.Trans. Even C. of A. can‟t make success of it – unless subsidised orders.

Com. Sec. Smiths‟ Docks; Vickers : Bethlem Steel?? – all now interested. Consortium not impossible.

L.P. Don‟t subsidise Malta yard at expense of our own yards.

P.M. But don‟t let Malta go. Resolve current embarrassment first : then consider longer term.

3. Foreign Affairs. (oral).

F.Sec. a) Yemen.

Regime demand our withdrawal. I have instructed accordingly.

Args. against recogn. – impact on Aden etc. – have prevailed. We must therefore go. But leaves awkward sitn. : shooting over frontier etc.

Must base our case on fact that regime not in control of whole country and occupied by 18000 Eg. troops.

P.M. Real reason is impact on Aden : and . refusal to recognise Fedn.

Com.Sec. But all precedent points to non recogn. when only partial control.

That is sufficient reason. Emphasise also Y. troops in Fedl. Terry.

If so (frontier doubtful), we shd. evict them : and use for support of our main case.

P.M. But wh. leg do we stand on?

F.Sec. We recognise Iraq, wh. has a claim on Kuwait : and Persia despite claim on Bahrain. Don‟t base our action on Y. refusal to recognise Fedn.

We recognise Laos and S. V. Nam, although they depend on U.S. troops.

L.P.S. Agree. Rest simply on lack of control over whole country, leaves our hands free for future.

P.M. Agree.

b) Germany.

F.Sec. A.-G. relations correct but cool. Strong undercurrent of anti-G. feeling in U.K. Try to improve. Will consider with M. w‟out P‟folio.

L.P.S. Feeling is provoked by left wing opinion. [Exit Com.Sec.

c) Princess Margaret.

F.Sec. O‟seas advice unanimously agreed visit wd. be seen as act of political reconciln., wh. wd. have had bad effect on Five.

Reason had to be a constitl. reason – to prevent de G. from questioning it.

P.M. Regret unable to consult Cab. But cd. not have avoided political (mis_ interpretation of visit.

Ch.Duchy. It was on Thursday. P.M. cd. have consulted Cab.

P.M. Apologise.

4. Statement on Defence 1963. C.(63)17.

M.Def. New form of W.P. Avoids difficulties provoked by annual series of full W.P.

P.M. Last sentence? Either obvious or needs expln. Omit.

M.Def. Agree.

P.M. Defence system is indivisible : or forces : But not orgn. wh. is under considn.

Refce. to I.J enquiry doubtful, particularly if it comes to nothg. and we depart from their proposals.

M.H. Scrap whole W.P. Four paras. on this subject are absurd.

M.Def. No ¨our supporters expect something. Omit I.J. para : and substitute tribute to Forces. Call it “Foreword by M. Def.”

Home Sec. Some refce. to C.D. desirable. Para.2, 2nd sent. end – “and with the civil authorities”.

P.M. Agree. Detailed amdts. to be cleared with M. Def.

M.w‟out Watch relations with Press.

P‟folio.

M.Def. Agree. I will discuss with M‟ster w‟out P‟folio.

5. Industrial Disputes : Elecy. Indy. (oral).

[Enter M. Power &amp; Att. Gen.

Home Sec. Have considered remit. Nothing possible in C. of E. Bill. Changes in law must be linked with changes in Emergency Powers Act 1920, wh. needs modernisation anyhow.

Ch.Duchy. ?A Royal Commission. There may be no single, sensible course; but if so let R.C. say so. Shd. consider compulsion in all industries.

M.Lab. Let Cttee. consider E.P. Act first, then reconsider R.C.

L.P. Agree. R.C. might provoke T.U.‟s – unfortunate in relation to N.E.D.C. and N.I.C.

L.Ch. Agree. R.C. might be wholly negative.

Home Sec. And we need powers to control consumer (if severe weather) as well as producers (go-slow movements etc.)

Ch.Duchy R.C. cd not be objected to by the T.U‟s. if t.o.r. right: and wd be appropriate in context of modernising Britain.

Home Sec But R.C. on T.V. attitudes etc is wider than emergencies drill. Let latter go ahead anyhow.

Ch.Duchy. Former is impracticable in terms of legve. sanction. But let R.C. say so.

P.M. Let emergencies drill go ahead. When result ready, consider also wider issue.

[Exit Att Gen

6. Commercial Policy : East-West Trade. C.(63)13 and 15.

[Enter M.Avn.

F.Sec. Collapse of Brussels means pressure for more E.W. trade. I have listed issues. U.S. accept increase to trade may relax issues in long run : but in short term merely increases Soviet ability to embarrass West politically. Cuba particularly sensitive.

P.B.T. Don‟t dissent. No scope unless we will take oil and agricl. products.

Trade will probably increase – from 3% to 5% : but not dramatically.

Accept F. Sec‟s indivl. points, except L. Fair and …

Ch.Exch. Agree. But on oil, tho‟ I don‟t favour general policy of importing R. oil, we mustn‟t be over eager to import it – as we appear to be.

Better to let deal founder – if it does – on price of ships.

P.B.T. I have made it clear that ships for oil is essence of deal : no question of open quota for R. oil.

M.Power. Must stick to this.

L.P.S. S.U. has favourable balance of visible trade with us : unfavourable with rest of £ area. Former used to balance latter. Do we want this?

P.B.T. Better than bilateral negotns. with £ area countries.

M.Power. But para 11 of C(63)15 suggests enlargement of oil deals policy.

F.Sec. Oil interests are disturbed – on grounds we shall lose as much on third country tankers as we gain on S.U. ships.

L.P. That is blackmail – to be resisted!

P.M. Can‟t oppose a limited oil-ships deal, particularly since quota merely lets oil in and Russians still have to sell it.

Ch.Exch. But it‟s cheap! Better to add it to strategic reserves.

M.Def. Not at cost of defence budget!

P.M. On general issue of R. oil imports, go warily.

F.Sec. But watch extension of credits. Six will oppose it.

L.P. We shd. consider our own interests as regards credit.

P.B.T. And Six live in a glass house themselves.

M.Trans. And our competitors are not Six but Japan etc.

F.Sec, But oil and pipe are on margin of COCOM list. Watch them in cold war context.

P.B.T. If no relaxn. on oil and agricl. products, no scope for increase in E.W. trade.

M.Def. U.S. policy is really directed to economic blockade of S.U. We can‟t afford this in post Brussels period.

Ch.Exch. Particularly when U.S. try to keep out our wool.

P.B.T. M. Def. right. If U.S. object to pipe, let them try to get it added to COCOM list.

M.Avn. Chinese want more aircraft – Britannias and Comets. Latter wd. be £10 m.

P.B.T. Viscount deal must go through.

P.M. E.P.C. shd. prepare brief for P.B.T.‟s visit to Washington.

We shd. sell anything we can on sound commercial basis. Marginal items shd. be considered for addn. to COCOM list and settled one way or another.

M.Ag. Selling more means buying more. Increase from 3% to 5% = £70/100 m.

Limited oil deal means that balance must be agricl. products.

Currently : £63.8 m. of agricl. imports. Are we to double this (ignoring

cereals wh. are on OGL). – in terms of beef, s‟berry pulp etc?

Future agricl. policy must rest on containment of domestic prodn. leaving room for some expansion of imports. But decision in each case – cereals, beef etc. – must be taken on merits; can‟t decide in principle to enlarge R. agricl. products.

P.B.T. If we have a free market, rivals can fight it out within whatever quota we open.

M.A.F.F. But price must be watched also : it cd. depress market and be expensive to Exch.

Ch.Exch. Will discuss with E.P.C. – and P.B.T.‟s brief.

F.Sec. In COCOM debate we may be in minority of one!

[Exit M. Avn.

7. Agricultural Policy : Farm Price Review. (oral).

Ch.Sec. Large prospective increase (£40m) in Exch. Support: and in output.

But incomes tending to fall. Some change in structure for pigs and eggs desirable.

Max redn. on 2½% formula is £23 m. Open negotn. at £13 m.

No chance of agreed settlement.

M.A.F.F. Standstill review wd. leave farmers with half of gain from efficiency.

W.P. will point way to further changes – in addn. to eggs and pigs – wh. will limit Exch. burden. This is more important than details of price review.
