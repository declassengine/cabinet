C.C. (63) 40 21 June 1963. 10 a.m. H/C.

1. Resignation of S of S. for War (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip.

P.M. I have followed post-Vassall drill. Have met Oppn P.C.‟s twice yesterday. They want S. Cttee: long, risk of leaks, Party-ridden. They wd. reluctantly accept full ‟21 Tribunal. I proposed our scheme – judicial enquiry with “optional” powers. They want long drawn out, muck-raking enquiry, during which harm would be done wh. no report cd. undo.

They also want enquiry embracing “Parly aspects” – i.e. events of night of 21/22 March, role of Law Officers etc. But that is for floor of House, not a Committee.

Therefore stick to our proposal, and announce to-day.

F.S. Public will say that this won‟t enable them to judge.

P.M. We will publish as much of report as possible. ? Say in Statement, that will discuss report with Oppn and then decide whether to publish in full or in part.

Ch. Duchy And make clear that any form of enquiry wd. have to take into account that security is involved and that Ward‟s case is sub judice.

Com. Secy And other damaging reports about individuals shd. not be unnecessarily ventilated.

M. Def. Liberation has published article with serious charges against several members of Govt. Read translation to Cabinet.

P.M. Let Ministers concerned write to Denning asking him to deal with these allegations.

L.P. And Ministers shd. not lightly abandon legal remedy without legal advice.

P.M. But don‟t let one Minister sue, but not another. Otherwise inferences drawn. Ministers are entitled to take legal advice: but they should consult me before taking action.

M. Def. Centralise advice in A.G.‟s Office: and let him draw article to attention of Ministers named.

Ch. Duchy Shepherd‟s name is recurring in this: he is origin of many of these rumours.

M. Trans. I agree. Give details.

P.M. Home Secy to investigate Shepherd; and ? all material to be given to Denning. If D. can‟t act without powers, we must say we will consider giving him powers. But hope he can act without them.

Com. Secy I am writing to P.M. asking that allegations (specified) about me shd. be referred to Denning.

M.H. Will this clear Com. Secy of security risk? Will nothing else transpire?

P.M. Denning will be looking into Ward-Profumo case.

Witnesses before Denning are protected by qualified privilege: if malicious, they deserve to be prosecuted.

2. Kenya. C(63) 105.

Com Secy Hoped to delay independence till Easter. Now Federation proposed.

We must not be blamed for holding it up.

Defence safeguards: year for rundown.

Therefore accept 12 December.

M. Def. As from indepce we may not be able to use forces from this base, more than once. But must accept this risk.

First Secy V. quick. Bad effect on Central Africa, where I can‟t move as quickly.

P.M. Defer till Cab. on Monday.
