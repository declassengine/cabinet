C.C. (63) 38 13th June, 1963 11.30.am

1. Resignation of S. of S. for War (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip.

M.H.L.G. Distaste for this morning‟s Press. I had no intention of resigning; and I am appalled that yesterday‟s Cab. discussion shd. have been so widely, but inaccurately reported.

P.M. Good faith agreed? Yes. so far as I am concerned.

Good judgement? P. held to his story throughout, to extent of making personal statement &amp; bringing legal action. Two Cab. Ministers, Chief Whip and both Law Officers were deceived.

F.S. P.M. must emphasise that behaviour of a liar and a slut not typical of Br. public life. Otherwise damage irreparable. On security, see para 28: implies P. may have been in contact with K. ?Prosecute Ward under O.S.A.

L. Ch. Since report written, have become aware that next Sunday‟s N. of World will reveal that P. was to be contacted for information in 1961, but K. refused pressure by Ward to do it.

My para 28 based on insufficient evidence. But N. of W. story going back to 1961, is new: and shd. be sent to H. Wilson with my report.

Prosecution of W. under O.S.A. for Law Officers. But might be difficult in absence of corroboration of K‟s statement.

P.M. Para 28 shd. make it clear tht this informn reached Ministers only a few days ago. Otherwise we shall be blamed.

M.Def. This will divert blame to Secy Service. Why did they do nothing?

Ch. Duchy. Because Iv. had left U.K. on previous day and Ward therefore ceased to be a security risk.

Ch. Exch. Even so, Ward still thought it worth while to contact P.

L. Ch. I will rewrite para 28 to indicate it was a by product of an enquiry for other purposes.

M.A.F.F. Watch link with para 8. It looks as if Secy S. knew of secy risk about German rearmament in 1961 and had it corroborated in Jany 1963 – and yet did not tell P.M. This is relevant to efficiency of S.S and therefore to issue of good judgement. Suppose we are asked if a check with S.S. was carried out before Ministers accepted P‟s statement on 21 March?

M.H. And same qun is relevant to initial confrontation with P. on 4 Feby?

L.Ch. Dy Dir. Gen was consulted as soon as Chapman Walker approached us. He had nothing to contribute qua security.

L.P. That is our dilemma. Report is confined to security: But much of informn wh. it excluded wd. help us on point now at issue.

M.Def. Did D.G. of Sy S. know at this time – or shortly after – about the police report of 30 Jan? If so, he ought to have told us at once.

P.M. V. wild allegations are now flying about. I shall confront each Minister concerned with these, in order to clear ourselves; and all M.P.‟s among our supporters.

P.B.J. Is this wise? It wd. enable anybody to say anything.

P.M. But otherwise I shall be constantly asked “Did you know?” and “What did you do about it?”.

Important to emphasise that, from outset in Feby, we took initiative in asking Secy Service for advice. And we must get from them full report on part they played.

M.W.P. Most damaging fact now revealed is that, when we agreed his personal statement, we did not realise that since 1961 P. was a security risk.

P.M. Any man of irregular life is now a security risk; cf 19th century.

L. Ch. S.S. cd. not have known P. was a secy risk without following his movements – wh. they wd. not have done without instructions from P.M.

P.M. I will give Report to H.W. and suggest enquiry analagous to procedure proposed in Vassall debate.

L.P. Can we avoid a vote in debate?

P.M. Probably not.

L.P. Both Law Officers and Ch. Whip shd. be allowed to speak; and L. of House shd. wind up. All are entitled to vindicate themselves.

Sol. Gen. Att. Gen. and I with P‟s own solicitor (v. high repute) drafted the personal statement. I read it to Ch. Whip and other Ministers. P. objected to “Miss K and I were on friendly terms”: but we insisted it must stand. I myself examined him: but he was adamant. I was satisfied and I am not gullible. No question that statement was accepted by us in good faith.

P.M. Att. Gen shd. wind up; he can protect Solicitor.

Att. Gen. Better for me to intervene on the one episode wh. I know.

Ch. Duchy. Intervention too scrappy. Either Att. Gen. or I shd. wind up.

L.Ch. Att. Gen shd. intervene fairly early – to get it on record clearly.

Ch. Duchy. A 2 day debate?

P.M. Don‟t give malcontents too long. [Enter M.Edn

We can probably carry H/C. In country people will probably accept good faith of Govt. and perhaps errors of judgement. They will not forgive flippancy. I have never experienced an episode like this before: and I am deeply shocked. That is what I shall try to show – that I resent the whole thing. I trusted a colleague: and he betrayed me.
