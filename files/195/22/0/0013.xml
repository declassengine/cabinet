C.C. (63) 13 27th February, 1963 11.30.am

1. Organisation for Defence C. (63) 27

[Enter Ch.Whip: M/S. C.R.O.:

First Lord : S.of S. War: S.of S.

Air : M./Avn: C.A.S. vice C.D.S.

P.M. Central orgn of Defence under considn for some months. Refce to I.J. Report not to be published or referred to as such in debate.

1) Why changes are needed. Historical review since 1900. Courses of present discontents.

2) What changes are needed:-

a) formulation of policy: strengthening of Defence Cttee: official Cttee: strengthening of Cab secretariat.

b) Execution of policy:-

(i) Modify existing system.

(ii) Subordinate Service Depts to M.of Defence.

(iii) Completely integrated M.of Defence.

(i) is inadequate. (iii) goes too far and is objectionable as regards eg. uniform proposal. Therefore adopt (ii) of wh. essential features are:-

a) Retain separate identities of Services: morale &amp; tradition.

b) C. of S. to remain Heads of Services with individual &amp; corporate responsibilities.

c) Integrate new organism in one building. V. important, if plan acceptable, politically important to take initiative, therefore announce in Defence debate: publish detailed W.P. before summer recess. Examine separate problem of M.Avn simultaneously, in light of civil interests.

M. Def. Endorse P.M.‟s remarks. Have discussed with Service Ministers and C. of S.: general agreement on Course B (including Course A); general disinclination to adopt Course C – tho‟ approach to functional concept in some matters may develop naturally when all Depts. are accommodated together – which is essential.

Orgn: retain Service chain of command, i.e. separate Services.

Opn: C.of S. to remain Heads of Services, with right of advising me or P.M.

Important to leave M/Def. time to think. Service Ministers must therefore have real status in H/C.

On M.Avn. I/J concept of reversing agency role too simple. R. &amp; D. cannot be separated from prodn. Sponsorship of industry inappropriate to M.Def. therefore impartial investign needed - preferably by Tsy with outside advice.

On procedure, agree P.M.‟s proposals.

M.Lab. As S. of S. War in 1958, remember we failed then because we were aiming at Course C. We shd. have succeeded with Course B.

therefore agree: and endorse M.Def. on status of Service Ministers, who shd. also attend Def. Cttee.

M. Avn: agree procedure: but solution shd. be pretty drastic and shd. put military R. &amp; D. &amp; prodn in M.Def.

Reject Course C: don‟t present Course B as merely transitional.

F.Sec. Endorse official Cttee. V. valuable.

M.A.F.F. Share M.Lab‟s view of 1958 episode. But Service thinking has developed since then: and Course B. now right. But Course C may develop naturally; and it has merits. Endorse view of status of Service Ministers. M.Avn really formed to deal with aircraft industry‟s problems. M.Def. wd. need to reassume control even of rest of reorgn was not being implemented.

Ch. Duchy V. valuable report for Defence debate. Must avoid premature leak. Must also enlist support of our own back benches. ? Let a few into the secret in advance. Course B is right: and we shd. not publicly go further. But part I is unconvincing in so far as it exalts Def. Cttee as originator of defence policy and depresses M.Def. Remedy may be right: but justification wrong.

L.P.S. Parly aspect difficult. There will be pressure for details – wh. we can‟t satisfy to July. And our own supporters will be unprepared.

On substance, see para. 22. Remedy leaves a Service Minister with no right of appeal to Cab. and no ultimate control over own expdre. This points to M/S. concept rather than full Minister.

But, if so, C.of S. will have greater power than Ministers. This points logically to Course C., where only one C.of S. concept.

P.M. Status of Service Ministers v. important.

First Secy. What has happened to Minister of R. &amp; D. and Prodn, under M. Defence?

L.P. Geographical integrn right. But will it be too centralised?

C.S.A. v. important, existing incumbent has too many other jobs. He must be more deeply embedded. in defence structure.

M. Health Don‟t launch in Defence debate. We shall be exposed, without answers, in that debate and in subsequent Service debates. We ought to think it all out – and consider adopting some of element of Course C.

[Exit L.P.

M.W.P. Agree. Why wasn‟t the plan in our W.P? And can we prepare our detailed plan thereafter in hubbub of public debate, wh. may favour Course C. Disappointing if we then come out with detailed Course B.

M. Def. Timetable precluded putting plan in W.P.

On disclosure, plan will leak if delayed beyond debate. Also some advantage in encouraging public debate, particularly as regards orgn intended to last under all Govts.

S.of S. Air Agree on danger of leakages. And don‟t lose advantage of anticipating Oppn plan.

P.M. Must outline plan in principle in debate. Then leave open for discussion on basis that we shall publish detailed proposals by end of Summer.

M.W.P. H/C. resents having things sprung on them. Therefore tone of presentation important.

[Exit M. Health

M. Def. Agree. But we must not get into position of always having to publish W.P. before a debate.

L.Ch. But why didn‟t we put our plan in Defence W.P? And is it defensible to be able to say nothing about M.Avn? Or about Course C – wh., however much we may dislike it, will be raised.

P.M. Avoid this by not making plan central feature of debate but also not minimising it. Thus stimulate debate.

F.Sec. That is not taking on initiative.

P.M. Outline basic principle – 3 separate Services: C.of S. to remain heads of Services: Service Depts. to be geographically integrated with M.Defence: Service Ministers to be subordinated to, and work closely with, M.Defence: M.Avn to be examined separately. Say welcome debate: and intend to implement our plan later in year.

Can we sustain this through from disaster?

Home Sec. Can‟t risk leak implicit to further delay. Adopt P.M.‟s tactics and promise W.P. in due course as basis of further debate, in which door wd. be left open for Course C without commitment.

S.of S. Air For benefit of our own backbenchers, Service Ministers shd. be known to support the plan.

M.Def. Let a small section of Parly Defence Cttee into secret before weekend?

P.M. Present our thinking as further stage in historical process: outline general principles: promise detailed W. P. in due course.

Ch. Duchy, M.W.P. &amp; Ch. Whip to concert with M.Def. tactics of presentation to Party and hosting of Press. Add one Service Minister.

First Sec. Don‟t commit ourselves to further W.P.

P.M. Agree: promise detailed proposals – wh. will in fact be a W.P.

I will thank Ismay &amp; Jacob. And I am glad that Service Ministers will co-operate in plan.
