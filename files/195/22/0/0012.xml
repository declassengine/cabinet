C.(63)12 21 February 1963. 10.30 a.m.

[Enter M/S. C.R.O. – Devonshire

1. Parliament. (oral).

Ch.Duchy. As in statement.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral).

a) Central Africa.

First Secy. Field‟s speech favours Ec. union with N. Rh. R.W. will now press for political union. N. Rh. pressing for secession. Confce. increasingly important – wh. Fedl. Govt. wd. attend if nature of assocn. left open.

N. Rh. wd. attend if Fedn. ended and S. Rh. wd. attend if held in Africa and Fedn. ended. We mustn‟t carry sole responsy. for ending Fedn. Act while S. and N. Rh. united in hostility to Fedn.

F.Sec. Agree. Call confce. and make them confront one another.

P.M. Must concentrate on some central links – common services etc. – in inter Govtl. form : not elective. R.W.‟s latest attitude is encouraging in this respect.

F.Sec. Watch our responsy. internationally – for S.R.L.

Ch.Duchy. Real chance of achieving something – if only R.W. can be by-passed.

P.M. Admission to C‟wealth tricky. Must be abstention from black-balling all round ¨no b-b‟ing of S. Rh. wh. wd. drive her to S. Africa.

First Secy. R.W. won‟t disappear without some form of fight. But Field won‟t support him in violence. He will want share of defence forces for himself.

Legn. on Ny. will compel us to make some statement on our intentions about Fedn.

M.Health. Speed it all up and dissolve Fedn. in this Parlt.

M.Lab. No : wd. drive R.W. to extreme action.

L.P. And wd. precipitate awkward political clash in Lords.

P.M. Arrange special Cab. for further discussn. R.W. weaker if can no longer rely on S.Rh. element in armed forces. Wd. it pay us to kill him off now?

L.Ch. But something to put in his place. Hence need for confce.

[Enter Ch.Whip.

b) Denmark : Faroes.

F.Sec. Danes propose 12 mile limit for Greenland : and now for Faroes for straight base lines by April ‟64. This is worse than Iceland, where we got a 3 year phase out. We have therefore protested : but Danes unlikely to yield – frightened of Communism in Faroes.

Can we say “no fish – no butter”?

M.Ag. Iceland was an economic problem : Faroes not – only political i.e. wish to be treated as Iceland. Sizeable proportion of our industry‟s catch : but industry ask only that Govt. shd. not agree. They won‟t ban landings until 12 m. limit fully in force. They believe – contrary to Danes – that F. can‟t lose U.K. market and that compromise will be fixed up in the year.

But if not, our future plans for industry – based on agrt. about F.- will be in danger. Dangerous if D. offer 2 or 3 years : we shd. be tempted to accept – but ought not to.

If we don‟t accept one year, shall we get even that? Better to face that than to agree one year.

L.Ch. If so, our ships can call for protection.

M.Ag. No : they won‟t. They wd. prefer de facto acceptance.

3. Satellite Communications. C(63)16,18,19,23 &amp; 25.

[Enter P.M.G. S.of S. Air:

M.Avn. M.P.B.W.

P.M. Two problems: a) What sort of system?

b) What shd. be our contribn.?

M.Avn. U.S. system operational by ‟67. Prospect of large revenues – and large contracts. Our interest is qua ELDO, electronics etc. and forces want a system. We therefore want a share : either a small share of U.S. system or larger share of indept. Eurn. system.

Start by telling Eur. that we propose to make our own sats and to use ELDO; asking whether they will join, and then either going ahead on that basis or making joint approach to U.S.

L.P. U.S. don‟t really want intl. co-opn. – apart from receiving stations. They will do the rest themselves. Do we accept this – or fight, either alone or in concert with Europe. If latter, ratify ELDO and ESRO conventions, since v. small market for ELDO launchers without some venture like this.

P.M.G. U.K. participn. in U.S. system wd. be bound to be small. Altve. is collabn. with Europe and C‟wealth in indept. system : this wd. not be viable for some years.

Ch.Sec. Co-opn. with U.S. economic : Eur. system much less so. Ground stations are the key. Therefore try for world system first.

L.P. U.S. won‟t let us in : they want to monopolise technology.

Ch.Sec. You can‟t be sure till you try. Our bargaining posn. not v. strong :

ELDO convenn. not yet ratified, except by A‟lia : and launcher not capable of launching full size sat.

M.Avn. It can put up an effective sat.

Ch.Sec. Not as effective as U.S. sat.

S. of S. Air. I agree. Our only strong points are our real estate for an equatorial circuit (eg. Seychelles) and our ability to make a sat.

M.P.B.W. No : we must be able to launch as well. Blue Streak and Black Knight (and third stage) are available : and we mustn‟t now contract out of technological race.

Ch.Sec. But expense prohibits going it alone.

M.P.BW. £200 m. over 5 years : much already committed anyhow.

Ch.Sec. Too much!

M/S.C.R.O. Must carry C‟wealth with us, particularly A‟lia (Woomera).

S. of S. Air. To design sat. more important than to plan launchers. Don‟t leave sat to ESRO : we must have a capability of our own, in terms of design study.

Ch.Sec. Have accepted study for research sat. Don‟t accept communications sat until clear with ESRO.

L.P. We shan‟t persuade ESRO to accept our sat unless we have one.

Otherwise we shall pay, via ESRO, for a French-Italian-Swiss sat.

P.M. We must get into this business. Have a design study : convene an ESRO/ELDO confce. to discuss going it alone or co-operating with U.S. on basis of our real estate.

P.M.G. Not only real estate : also share of Eur. traffic wh. is essential for economic success.

S. of S. Air. And threat of rival system.

P.M.G. No place for rivalry hitherto in intl. communicns. Only recently hinted by U.S.

P.M. Can‟t accept U.S. monopoly. Promote design study of sat, subject to Tsy. agreement. Consider confce. (L.P.S. in lead) with Europe and C‟wealth.

[Exit S.&amp;S. Air.

4. Broadcasting Policy : Television Licences. C.(63)21.

P.M.G. B.B.C. need extra £1 from April – either by taking £1 excise duty on by increasing licence fee. Latter v. unwelcome to our supporters : not easily reconciled with decision to take more of I.T.V.‟s profits.

Ch.Exch. A good tax. If we give it up, we shall depart from principle that users of natd. indies. must pay for what they get and we shall run counter to our policy of diverting tax from direct to indirect.

Ch.Duchy. Increase in fee v. dangerous politically.

S.&amp;S. Scot. Particularly in Scotland.

P.M. Really a Budget question.

M.H.L.G. Many services – eg. housing – much more important. I support Ch. Exch.

M.Ag. I agree. No case for this relief of taxn.

M. Edn. I too agree. And viewers are going to get better services – for which people should pay more.

L.Ch. Root of trouble is B.B.C.‟s expenditure.

L.P. But it is we who insist on their having an extra channel!

L.Ch. Ease burden by paying in instalments?

P.M. Leave to be settled in Budget context. P.M.G. to circulate memo on history of duty.

[Exit P.M.G.

5. London : Employment, Housing and Land. C.(63)22).

M.H.L.G. Para.52 1st sent. is key. From this flows:-

a) need to find more land in London.

b) need to consider overspill, pending action on S.E. study.

c) need to find more land, inside and outside London, for

overspill resulting from S.E. study.

Ch.Sec. Tsy. content.

M.Health. Many snags. Eg. para.43 – marked improvement in housing )dangerous

para.2 – arrest move to South ) commitments

Change in law about cubic contracts? is not clarified : it is a change.

M.H.L.G. Will soften para. 43 : but mustn‟t imply homeless will disappear.

They are falling but they won‟t disappear yet.

P.M. Agree about para.43.

Para.41 - ½ m. houses for Londoners over 10 years. A commitment?

M.H.L.G. Includes private enterprises. On this basis can accept commitment.

Ch.Duchy Omit para 21, 2nd sent?

S of S Scot. Agree. Implies doing nothing to divert to N.E. and Scot.

M.H.L.G. Emphasise this is only for L.‟s own needs.

Ch.Exch. Better – this takes account of Govt.‟s determination to divert from S.E.

P.M. Agree.

Ch.Duchy. Still leaves contrast between plan for L.. and absence of plan for N.E. and Scot.

And watch Green Belt. Those hurt by this are same as those hurt by Greater L. plan. Scramble for land will start.

M.Ag. Most of Lea Valley already under option. Not genuine G.B. at all.

M.H.L.G. Impact on real G.B. v. small - ? 2%-5% over next 10 years, wh. will be more than offset by probable additions. But can‟t say so, pending S.E. study and action by L.A.‟s.

P.M. Consider strengthening para 65 for this purpose.

M.H. Para 66 (local enquiry) inconsistent with para 67 (pointer to Lea Valley).

M.Ag. But Lea Valley is ripe for redevelopment.

L.Ch. Charge of “prejudicing” is valid. Omit para 67 : or keep for debate.

P.M. Agree. What about committee in para 49?

M.H.L.G. Only voluntary informn. – social survey type of enquiry.

Report unlikely till end 1964.

L.Ch. Amend para 20. Not much doubt about law.

M.H.L.G. Amend : “in part in doubt”.

L.Ch. If publicn. not simultaneous with Bill, watch date of effect in para 21.

M.H.L.G. Will consult Ch. Duchy on timing of publicn. [Exit M.H.L.G.

6. The North East C.(63)20. [Enter M. Power.

P.M. Thank L.P. Next steps?

L.P. Detailed proposals via ordinary machine.

But announce as many as possible quickly : Govt. orders, investt. etc.

Some financial diffce. between South and unempt. areas is essential and above BOTAC.

Ch.Exch. Chasing procedure agreed by E.P.C. On incentives will discuss with L.P.

P.M. Short term measures are : -

a) general. )

b) local ) in application; and are appropriate to E.P.C.

Longer term measures are for P. &amp; E.

In 6 weeks before Budget, we must work out measures to be handled at same time.

7. Commercial Policy : Imports of Russian Oil. (oral).

[Enter Parly Sec. M. Trans. (H. Hallett).

P.B.T. Rumours say : a) U.K. tenders high.

b) ships dependent on oil.

c) planned oil output makes no provision for U.K. but

they wd. be willing to see what cd. be done.

We have said :

a) oil dependent on ships.

b) ships offer not open indefinitely : unempt. falling.

Party Sec. One tender we have put in has been regarded by Russians as v.

M/T. competitive. Firm now in direct contact with Moscow.
