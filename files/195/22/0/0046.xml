C.C. (63) 46. 11 July 1963. 5 p.m. H/C.

1. Foreign Affairs (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip: M/S. C.R.O.; M. Avn.

a) Yemen.

F.S. Evidence that Eg. has used some form of gas. U.N. has our material and in considering.

b) Laos.

Posn in Plain of Jars more stable: low level coopn between Commission Powers slightly more hopeful.

2. Policy towards S. Africa. C(63) 115.

F.S. Afro-Asian bloc will now try to organise expulsion of S.A. from U.N: trade boycott: arms boycott. U.S. wd. vote against first two: on arms they are more restrictive than ourselves, even in terms of arms for external use only. S.A. Amb. says his Govt. assume that we will continue to supply “external” arms: I have undertaken to try to secure fulfilment of existing orders. But at U.N.? We cd. prob. organise defeat of complete boycott, without using veto. Ditto for complete arms boycott. But minimise risk by moderate resn of arms, deploring apartheid, condemning small arms exports, and promoting rapporteur between Secy C. &amp; S.A.

M/S. C.R.O. C‟wealth Africans won‟t accept less than complete arms ban: probably want trade embargo also. Must try to stop small exports of repressive arms. Our trade interest with African C‟wealth members is no less than with S.A.

M. Def. S‟town Agt important. F. Sec.‟s line therefore right: but we must stick to it.

Ch. Sec. And have a clear line of demarcation – e.g. on tanks.

M. Avn £26 m. orders firm: £47 m. more in prospect.

Ch. Duchy Para. 5(b) not far from existing posn. Therefore we can accept 5(b), provided it isn‟t itemised in a schedule. It is a slight tightening up in practice.

M.H. 5(a)?

F.S. We have done this many times already.

Can we rest on 5(b) and not go further for moral reasons?

M. Def. If we do, we shall lose orders and perhaps S‟town Agt.

F.S. Then must be prepared to block in Secy C. and to be in minority if issue transferred to Assembly – where even old C‟wealth might not support us.

M/S. C.R.O. I agree: and remember H.C. Territories at S.A.‟s mercy.

Ch. Duchy But remember also staging rights etc. in Kenya &amp; elsewhere in black Africa.

F.S. Only altve – to defeat extreme Resn and put forward nothing in its place.

P.M. Adopt para. 5. [Exit M. Avn.

3. Nubian Monuments C(63) 119.

M. Edn As in memm.

L.P. Eg. reneging on remittance agt. U.K. interests will therefore oppose contribn.

F.S. And Eg. now using gas. Can‟t support.

P.M. But this is not for Eg: it is for intl culture!

L.P. ? Trade an Eg. contribn to A.S. against a payment by ourselves to our nationals.

P.B.T. But S.U. doing nothing.

Home Sec. I support M/Edn. Gas argument not a good one. We ought not to be philistine.

M. Edn I agree: but explore contribn from our blocked funds. U.S. said to have done this.

P.M. Explore.

4. Shipbuilding: Replacement for the “Queen Mary” C(63) 122.

Ch. Exch. As in memm.

M.T. Agree. Worse than original proposal: will provoke jealousies among other shipowners: no confidence in Cunard management. But v. emotional issue.

L.P. And damaging for N.E.

M.T. Offset by increase in loan scheme.

Announce Wed. next week.

5. Nato Nuclear Force: Mixed manned component. C(63) 121.

F.S. M-m force temporarily shelved after Birch Grove. But U.S. – and some Germans (and Italians) – still keen. Therefore we shd. divert interest into organisational problem of control and management of N.A.T.O.‟s nuclear forces, whatever they may be.

Don‟t press, pending L.P.‟s visit to Moscow. But take initiative in sense of circulating in N.A.T.O. at appropriate moment &amp; watching reaction.

M. Def. Let dust settle first; and rethink our objectives first.

F.O. &amp; M. Def. shd. consult at official level and consider altve courses.

V. dangerous overtones in any proposal to provide N.A.T.O. management even for existing nuclear forces.

P.M. No action till after L.P.‟s visit. Even then posn may not be wholly clear. Meanwhile, as M. Def. proposes at right moment.
