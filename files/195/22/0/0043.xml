C.C. (63) 43 27 June 1963. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip: Att. Gen.

Ch. Duchy As in Statement.

2. Peerage Bill (oral).

Ch. Duchy Have taken soundings. Opinion divided but majority favour rejecting amdt – if only to avoid turning Bill into W. Benn Enabling Bill.

? Endorse this, accepting risk of doing badly in division.

Ch. Whip. I agree. Don‟t let down solid, steady section of Party.

Ch. Duchy If defeated, accept as decision of House.

P.M. Agree.

3. Yemen (oral).

M. Def. All prisoners (except 2 sick) said to have left Y. Customs Post. U.S. now informed they will be brought to Taiz &amp; handed over to U.S. authorities if we express regret and undertake to prevent further incidents of this kind.

F. Sec. I agree.

Van Horn now arrived in Y. as U.N. supervisor of disengagement plan. He is now disillusioned: Egypt not withdrawing &amp; S. Arabia threatening to resume support of Royalists. Plan may fail: we can‟t recognise on this basis.

4. China (oral).

F. Sec. We are exporting Viscounts to China, including some U.S. equipment which U.S. regard as embargoed. We shall stick to our guns: but there will be a row.

M. Def. Yes: equipment not classified.

P.B.T. Similar equipment made under licence in this country. Links v. tenuous and we shd. go ahead.

M.H. I agree.

P.M. I agree. Having parted with licence, U.S. in no position to protest.

[Exit Att. Gen.

5. Nato Nuclear Force: Mixed Manned Component (oral).

[Enter F.L.A: M Avn: S of S. Air: C.D.S: F.S.L.

[Enter Com. Sec.

F. Sec. If M.R.B.M.‟s no good, future of missile lies on sea. If so, what form wd. we prefer?

F.S.L. If money available, submarines. Failing them, surface ships. A

“Monitor” – flat bottomed platform – less mobile than ocean going ship, &amp; more vulnerable.

M. Def. U.S. going ahead with launcher (IRBM) sites with priority above surface ships.

Annex A. to C(63) 103 shows plan militarily practicable: but not militarily necessary and a waste of money.

F.S. But if alternative is M.R.B.M.‟s, and land-based missiles on way out in favour of seaborne missiles, we must accept either submarines or this project.

F.S.L. No defence for ships planned at present. But if Russians react, we shall have to provide some protection. Subs. to shadow whole force wd. be large drain on Russian resouces: but they cd. shadow some of them. Availability of ports – participants: all N.A.T.O: worldwide – unclear.

F.S. Review of N.A.T.O. strategy will produce demands for M.R.B.M.‟s, wh. T.S.R.2. will only partly meet. Only altve is this project, unless we go for subs.

M. Def. But there is enough nuclear capability available already.

F.S. And we can‟t say no strategic requirement by N.A.T.O., since we have already assigned our V-bomber force, wh. is a strategic weapon.

Home Sec. How vulnerable?

F.S.L. Relatively invulnerable, because of speed, until S.U. have more nuclear-powered subs.

Com. Sec. They will – and can – be kept under Russian observation.

F.S.L. But adequate defence – escorts etc. – cd. cost vast sums.

See Annex A(q).

L.P. And, unless some new intl authority devised, they wd. be technically pirates, wh. any nation wd. be entitled to attack.

P.B.T. Or at least to harass, on familiar Russian lines.

F.L.A. And manpower demand v. formidable: wd. inevitably limit our conventional capability.

C.D.S. N.A.T.O. strategy still based on 1957 posn, when West had nuclear superiority but U.S. cd. not reach S.U. and this function allotted to N.A.T.O. Hence demand for replacement weapons for SACEUR, on assumpn that he can fight a nuclear war and win – whereas this is now impossible and we rely on U.S. long-range deterrent. If this is ever used, we need not bother any more.

Therefore we must get N.A.T.O. strategy right – i.e. SACEUR is there to deter, not to fight. But deterrence implies tactical nuclear weapons.

L.P.S. Then why have we assigned our strategic bomber force (and POLARIS subs) to SACEUR.

And deterrence means deterrence at all levels and in all forms. But Europe will insist on having some share in this; and unless our strategy takes account of this, we can‟t influence N.A.T.O. strategy.

P.M. Cuba showed interrelation of nuclear and conventional forces – i.e. that you can take limited action and face enemy with choice of accepting or starting nuclear war. Same is true of Berlin.

L.P. But this requires only enough nuclear power. Beyond that law of diminishing returns operates: and risk of nuclear war by accident increases.

P.M. Nevertheless, Europe wants some say in use of nuclear force: not content simply to rely on U.S. Political problem is how to satisfy this feeling.

? Better to try to find some other, political, way of doing this rather than rely on technical military doubts. Hitherto, U.S. have been reluctant to sponsor this: and chances now reduced by de Gaulle‟s policy on force de frappe.

F.S. Must say to K. that i) we can‟t get support of Parlt for this force at this time. Must first show military requirement. Therefore complete N.A.T.O. studies by specified date.

ii) political control and management can be discussed simultaneously – in relation to any force wh. can be described as “multilateral”.

iii) technical aspects of M.L.F. and variants can also be discussed at same time.

Implicit in ii) and iii) that no commitment meanwhile: but is this realistic as regards iii)?

M. Def. M.L.F. does not meet European aspiration for something independent of U.S.A. – unless U.S. veto is waived, as Germans see. But it wd. be politically impossible in this country.

Realise this in any discussion under ii) – wh. must begin with our chief ally, France, if we are to have a genuinely European altve.

F.S. Fr. Won‟t assign f. def. But they might discuss ii). But even if U.S. waived their veto, we shd. have to maintain ours; and G. wd. not accept this.

M. Def. But if we can persuade U.S. to defer M.L.F., we cd. try to get talks with Fr. going: and some Eur. altve might emerge.

L.P.S. But Fr. clearly not prepared to cooperate.

M. Def. But they won‟t have the M.L.F. either. Therefore try to find some altve, because, if we go on with M.L.F. without France, we shall move still further away from Fr. – without whom we can‟t have a Eur. defence policy.

L.P. And note de G.‟s support for Concorde project. It shows he is prepared for technological coopn.

F.S. But Eur. deterrent wd. be years behind U.S. deterrent. And it wd. be v. expensive. Moreover, our veto wd. have to be preserved: and this wd. be unacceptable to G.

P.M. Problem is to satisfy G. But must this mean an M.L.F. wh. will be v. expensive and disrupt our own Navy? Wd. G. dare to break the 1954 Treaty, at risk that we might break our undertaking to maintain Br. troops in G. for 50 years.

Treaty not broken if Fr. give them nuclear weapons.

L.P.S. That may be the greater danger. U.S. have seen that 40% G. share of M.L.F. wd. prevent G. from being able to afford to pay Fr. for them.

M.A.F.F. Yes: motive of M.L.F. is to prevent Eurn deterrent . Do we support this?

L.P. No. A Eurn influence in cold war shd. take political and conventional – military forms.

L.P.S. You won‟t persuade Europe of this. Nassau showed that we don‟t accept it ourselves.

And Fr. won‟t talk to us until after our General Election.

M. Avn But they took initiative in promoting discussions on military space.

M. Def. I cd. explore further during routine discussns with Messmer.

F.S. But other Eur. countries wd. have to be brought in very early – i.e. in N.A.T.O. context.

P.M. For purposes of discussn – not negotn – with K, endorse i) &amp; ii) of F. Sec. Fix early terminal date. iii) more tricky: Parlt wd. regard it as a commitment.

L.P. Yes. Project has no friends in Parlt – see yesterday‟s Lords debate.

L. Ch. And legal problems v. complex.

P.M. And iii) wd. demonstrate – as we agree – that force is militarily practicable. Therefore put emphasis, in talk with K., on risks to E.-W. rapprochement, test ban treaty etc., if we go ahead with technical discussions. Difficult – because K.‟s foolish visit to G. (and Berlin) has inflamed G. public opinion, contrary to our real objective. But must try. I will not accept technical discussions without further refce to Cab.

F.S. But U.S. may go ahead without us. What then?

P.M. We must reconsider. But avoid commitment during K.‟s v. brief visit. Otherwise, Govt. will fall in Parlt. We must gain time.

F. Sec. Then we must press on – fast – with N.A.T.O. review of strategy.

P.M. And ii) also. But avoid iii) until negotns with S.U. over test ban are over. They remain our prime objective.
