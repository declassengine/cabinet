C.C. (63) 27 30th April, 1963, 10.a.m.

1. Security: Radcliffe Report. [Enter M/S; C.R.O.; Ch. Whip

P.M. At outset asked R. to advise on future procedure. Alternatives – Romer; or Radcliffe without powers (Blake); or full 1921 drill.

R.‟s own proposal: permanent C.G. of Sy. established by statute. To give individual powers of tribunal wd. go too far.

Therefore altve

a) Standing commission: judicial chn 2 ex C-servants}no legn:

b) Standing committee of P.C.‟s of both Houses }an advantage

c) Govt to consult (b) &amp; mobilise (c) if necy.

d) If necy (a) to have powers of 1921 Tribunal.

3) Govt to consult (b) as report.

M. Def. Wd take sting out of attack on Tribunal.

Ch. Exch. And permanency wd accustom public to idea of repetition of cases.

Ch. Duchy. Watch Oppn: float it as a possible scheme, after warning H. Wilson.

L.P.S. Two C. Servants: or one plus an outsider?

P.M. I will sound H. Wilson on the scheme.

2. Federation of Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland C. (63) 73 &amp; 75.

First Secy. Field‟s reply intended to be reasonable. But it offers no concession on independence.

Our own draft produced in consultn with L.Ch &amp; Com. Secy before his departure for C.E.N.T.O. We accept no necy links between links confce and indepce confce: but emphasise necy connection between indepce confce and confce on dissoln of Fedn. Para 9 therefore stresses importance of their coopn; and para 10 indicates importance of discussion on amdt of constn before indepce.

Dissoln of Fedn v. tricky: if disorderly, greatly to our discredit. Admn in Salisbury v. concerned about this &amp; have persuaded R.W. to send me a letter about economic dangers of growing fissiparism. He suggests compromise on S. Rh. – i.e. to get indepce on date of final dissoln of Fedn, and N. Rh &amp; Ny. to get it at same time. This wd. open way to confce. to deal with wind up of Fedn and future links. R.W. wd. propose this if we support it. But note that R.W. ignores our para 10. Even so, he is right about need for confce. if dissoln of Fedn is not to be chaos.

Alport supports our draft reply but doubts whether Field will accept it. If Cab. approve it, it can be our answer to R.W. as well - i.e. we are suggesting to Field exactly what R.W. wants.

L. Ch. We can‟t accept R.W.‟s initiative without any refce. to changes in S. Rh. constn. Therefore our draft shd. stand.

Ch. Duchy. The draft goes further towards Field than first letter. It is therefore less satisfy, and will create impression that we are preparing to surrender.

L. Ch. No: see para 10, wh. puts it as strongly as we realistically can.

L.P. I agree with Ch. Duchy. Draft is too sugary. We must insist that, before indepce is granted, they must cooperate in dissoln of Fedn – as draft does: and that, probably after indepce they will liberalise constn – by certain objective tests – as draft does not.

L.P.S. We shall have public support for first stipulation: we must make it clear whether we are prepared to deny indepce to S.Rh. if she won‟t herself amend her 1961 constn.

P.M. Defer that point as long as possible in order not to aggravate strains on a Fedn wh. is breaking up – e.g. refusal of N. Rh. to pay taxes etc. We must first have confce. on dissoln of Fedn and perhaps new links. Otherwise we shall have a new Congo on our hands.

M. Health If so, para 10 is premature in its admission tht we have only moral suasion as our weapon. ? Omit para 10 at this stage.

L.Ch. You can‟t avoid it, given Field‟s own references to it.

M. H.L.G. Alternatively, omit “before indepce is granted” in last sentence of para 10. This might get them to dissoln confce., and then we can bring them along to consider whether they will accept our conditions for indepce or assert it unilaterally. But in either event, dissoln wd. have been arranged in an orderly way.

L.Ch. I agree: omit these words and let Alport explain that this is not a condition of indepce but part of problem of getting it through Parlt in U.K.

M. Health But rest of para 10 will still expose weakness of our posn: and this is premature.

First Secy. C. Sec. has suggested – “H.M.G. wish to know whether, and if so in what respects, your Govtt &amp; Parlt intend to exercise the powers of amdt …”

Ch. Duchy. But this puts horse straight at fence. Suppose they refuse?

L.Ch. I agree: get them to confce on dissoln first.

Ch. Exch. Yes: but omit “could or”.

P.M. Agree: but put 10 before 9: and omit “thus” at beginning of 9.

First Secy. ? Omit invitation to Field to visit London. It would only dramatise sitn; and he wd. come with binding instrucns. Therefore put suggn to him orally. Round off letter with suitable new last para, emphasising urgency of arrangements for orderly dissoln of Fedn. Tell R.W. that we have done this; and give him copy of letter if Field agrees. Don‟t let him suppose that we accept also his own theory that S.R. will be given indepce (without refce to our conditions) on dissoln of Fedn.
