C.C.(63) 15. 7 March 1963, 10.30 a.m.

1. Parlty. Business (oral). [Enter Ch.Whip, M/S. C.R.O.

Ch. Duchy As in statement.

2. Chief Anthony Enahoro. C.(63) 36,37 &amp; 40.

Home Sec. F.O. Act differs from Extrn Act in that political offence is not

excluded. Therefore applies to E.‟s offence of conspiracy to overthrow

N. Govt. He claims that before arrival he was assured by H.O. that he

could come and go with immunity. This is untrue: he was warned

about F.O. Act. When arrested he applied for habeas corpus: this was

refused by Divl Court: leave of appeal refused. Decision

therefore rests with me, personally, “if I think it just” to order his

return. How can I do so when he clearly will not be allowed counsel

of own choice – particularly since he wants Dingle Foot (already

rejected in relation to Awolowo)? Assurance deemed sufficient by

Divl Court overtaken by Head‟s discovery that [Enter Att.Gen.

for. counsel will not be allowed. N. Govt. clearly determined to find

him guilty. They can do so (keep their assurance) either by

Ch. Justice disallowing Br counsel or by themselves disallowing

entry on other grounds.

I cannot take account of C‟wealth political considns.

Att.Gen. Only reason for refusal wd. be clear statement by N. Govt. that

they will not admit for. counsel.

Home Sec. See Head‟s telegram. N. Govt. cannot afford risk that E. (and

Awolowo) may be acquitted.

Att.Gen. If so, it appears that Br. counsel will be refused. But this ought

to be clarified.

L.Ch. Act only allows return if strong or probable presumption of guilt.

This has been established in Br. Courts. Home Sec. can now

refuse only if “unjust”. But no grounds – L.C.J. has said

satisfied no oppressive action.

Even if Br. counsel refused how can we refuse return of man

presumed guilty, when Nigerian Bar competent to defend him.

N. is independent: in many other independent ex-colonial territories

Br. counsel have no right to be heard. Why shd. we differentiate

against N. where standards of judicial procedure are high?

Consider Br. fugitive in C‟wealth country.

Home Sec. Parallel inexact.

L. Ch. No: it is correct. And it supports C‟wealth Secy‟s view.

M/S. C.R.O. Disastrous for relations if he is not returned. It will be held to

be gross indifference with N. administration of law wh. they inherited

from us. If not returned, he will go to Ghana &amp; exacerbate relations

already strained by Togo. Also N. L.Ch. has said that, if E. not

returned, he will resign from Judicial Cttee, to wh. recently elected.

For. Sec. I agree as regards effect on N. relations. Also N. Govt. wd. alter

law &amp; no Br. counsel wd. ever appear in N. courts again. N. Bar

competent.

Ch. Duchy. Might persuade N. Govt. to see why we can‟t return him. And

difficult to override Home Sec.‟s conscience or ignore Head‟s warning.

P.M. If this had happened in Uganda or Cyprus – where Br. counsel

are not allowed – shd. we still have said injustice.

L.P.S. Counsel of own choice means either a Nigerian outside N. or a

Br. counsel whom N. L.C.J. wd. approve. Can we get get this

assurance. [Enter M.H.L.G.

P.M. N. our only friend in Africa. Head has rung me: N. Govt think that Br. courts‟ ruling shd. suffice. If we now refuse, we are denying

integrity of N. Bar &amp; courts.

Shall I tell Head that we are not challenging the justice of returning

him, so long as ordinary operation of N. judicial procedure (i.e. ruling

of N. L.C.J.) proceeds freely? We must not break with N., if possible.

L.P.S.‟s compromise is therefore right.

L.Ch. This means asking N. Govt. if they will honour this undertaking,

as accepted by L.C.J. Can we really do this?

M/S. C.R.O. I agree. We can‟t continue to press N. Govt after our own

L.C.J. has said he is content.

L.Ch. See para. 2. of C(63) 36. This is only case where we have

refused return under F.O. &amp; Extrn Acts: and circumstances v.

different. N. treason trials have already yielded four acquittals.

It is pre-conception of just procedure.

Home Sec. I am not challenging fairness of procedure. But political action

to pervert procedure to real risk. Cd. P.M. get clearer assurance from

N. Govt. that, if he chooses N. Counsel (outside N.) or Br. counsel

(subject to N. L.C.J.‟s permission), this will be allowed.

F.Sec. You won‟t get this. For political reasons, N. Govt must refuse

entry to e.g. D. Foot.

Home Sec. I couldn‟t be sure of carrying H.C. on this basis.

P.M. Will N. L.C.J. help us by refusing Br, counsel.

Att.Gen. Probably not. Might refuse D. Foot; but another Br. counsel

might be allowed. On this basis Home Sec. shd. be safe.

Home Sec. But if N. L.C.J. agreed &amp; N. Govt. then refused for some

reason wh. we couldn‟t accept, our posn wd. be indefensible.

P.M. But altve, in terms of relations with N. Govt. even worse.

L.Ch. We can‟t assume that N. Govt. will not honour this undertaking

not to behave as in Awolowo case – i.e. not to prohibit entry merely on

ground that counsel was coming to defend a named individual.

Home Sec. But we need a further assurance – i.e. that entry will not be

prohibited (if N. L.C.J. agrees) on some other ground – except

obviously sound reason e.g. infectious disease.

F.Sec. This will put N. Govt in great political difficulty.

P.M. At least try to get Home Sec.‟s assurance by way of seeking

clarification of existing undertaking. I will send Head a message,

offering personal message to Abubakar.

M. Health. Watch risk that counsel might be admitted and then prevented

from pleading.

L.Ch. Too great a breach of faith.

P.M. Let Home Sec. draft what he would say in H/C: send this to

Abubakar, with appropriate message. Let me have draft, agreed

between Home Sec., Att.Gen., M/S C.R.O., F.Sec. &amp; L.Ch. But

give Head latitude: avoid clash, if we can.

Home Sec. Watch timing. Treason trial may collapse. If so, we can wash

our hands of E!

P.M. If Abubakar‟s reply unsatisfy, must consider further.

[Exit Att.Gen.

3. Farm Price Review (oral). [Enter Parly. Sec. B/T. (Green).

[Enter M.Lab.

M.A.F.F. No prospect of agreed settlement. Farmers want at least 2d a

gallon on milk. We can‟t agree – even if, as they want, increase is

done by bonus scheme.

Farmers now propose +£12 m: we have said - £2 m. Milk is £10 m.

therefore difference is between +2 and -2, outside schedule eggs accepted. Agreement near on pigs. therefore no change review best: minor adaptations to schedule for this purpose. – easements on barley, fertilisers: and some concession on pigs.

Ch. Sec. Pigs raise complications with Danes &amp; E.F.T.A. And concession

on barley will encourage prodn wh. ought to be checked.

M.A.F.F. But no change review must be offset – by some concession

if farmers are to have any benefit from efficiency.

Ch.Exch. Settle at E.P.C.

P.M. But no change in principle?

Ch.Exch. If individual changes are reasonable, will accept less than

£1.8 m.

4. Milk Marketing Board‟s Manufacturing Interests C(63) 34.

Ch.Exch. As in memm. Shd. we discourage M.M.B.? No: a sensible

arrangement and no real economic objn.

Ch.Duchy. But politically bad – after R.T.B.

M.A.F.F. Commercial arguments in favour. We only make small proportion

of butter consumed: i.e. no risk of monopoly.

Also no question of take-over: will only be done by agreement.

M.Def. On any basis, there will be a political row – especially since

Unigate Board are divided.

M.Lab. And farmers want M.M.B. to do its job of helping producers;

not to go into manufacturing.

Ch.Sec. And Board run on compulsory levy. Whose money is it that they

are using? The producers! And what do they say?

M.A.F.F. But only an extension of what they were designed to do.

M.Lab. But they shd. consult producers – e.g. by special meeting.

L.Ch. But they cd. spend £20 m. of own money in building creameries.

If they propose to buy, they shd. consult producers: but; if they agree,

we need not interfere.

S. of S. Producers dislike Board whose meetings are always rigged.

Scot. Other Boards are even worse. Therefore watch precedent.

M.A.F.F. Bulk of farmers trust M.M.B. and will accept the case.

S. of S. But watch political charge of State trading etc.

Scot.

M.A.F.F. This won‟t be serious if parties concerned agree.

P.M. And it isn‟t State trading: it is co-operative trading – wh. we

favour and hoped to encourage by entering Common Market.

Confirm unanimity on Board: if dissension, consult members.

M.A.F.F. To consult whole Board means speculation in shares of Unigate.

L.Ch. But it takes us off hook of State trading etc.

P.M. Managing Bd shd. make contract subject to approval of whole

Board and, if necessary, poll of members. Advise in this sense.

Ch.Whip. Unigate will demand high price. This recalls R.T.B. episode.

If any suggn that they will only sell whole business, politically much

more objectionable.

P.M. We must oppose anything like takeover of whole business.

Purchase of creameries less objectionable and we need not intervene

if Board as a whole approve or, if not, will sound members.

Ch.Exch. &amp; M.A.F.F. shd. advise interests in this sense, in agreed

form of words.

5. Valuation for Rating. C.(63) 35 &amp; 39. [Enter M.P.N.I.

M.H.L.G. Industry hit harder by revaln than houses. But rate call has also

risen. Discontent best alleviated by:-

a) refusal of derating: demand v. patchy: and wd. benefit our

own supporters, who don‟t need it!

b) offer of survey of impact of rates – wd. not relieve, but wd.

point to relief by N.A.B.

c) refusal of new local tax.

d) offer of exploration, on some public occasion, of reasons

for (c).

e) considn (in context of review of general grant) of

adjustment as between taxpayer &amp; ratepayer. But no hint of this yet.

Ch.Exch. e) wd. be dangerous. Exch. contribn already large &amp; rising.

Ch.Duchy. But watch politics. Minister must go further than pointing to

N.A.B.! Educn is involved. Minrs must therefore meet demand for

enquiry wh. might consider how social services shd. be paid for.

Home Sec. Taxn is fairer than rating: and quen of balance between them

is inescapable, particularly if rates rise while we try to get taxes down.

But v. dangerous to refer this to independent Committee: it is

for Cabinet to decide.

M.Edn. Educn‟s share of G.N.P. rising v. rapidly. We need an enquiry –

on Plowden lines, i.e. internal in character – into future financing of

educn in light of forward educn policies.

Ch.Exch. Even a Plowden enquiry wd. leak. We shd. study problem

wholly internally.

L.Ch. Seasonal occupn – i.e. seaside boarding houses – v. unfair.

?Enquiry limited to this.

M.H.L.G. No: wd. raise false hopes.

P.M. And a minor issue. Real issue is balance between rates &amp; taxes.

Ch.Sec. But rates are smaller proportion of total tax burden than before

war. Problem v. localised.

P.M. Outside enquiry unwise – either ineffective or dangerous.

M.W.P. Say survey of impact must come first.

First Sec. House rates are less bad than we feared. Therefore adopt M.W.P.‟s

proposal, &amp; defer decision on any further enquiry into e.g. financing

of educn.

M.Health. But we know what survey will produce – nothing v. dramatic

except “hardship” in individual cases. [Exit L.P.S.

[ .. Parly. Sec. B/T.

Ch.Duchy. Politically dangerous to rule out enquiry in Debate to-day.

Promise survey &amp; undertake to consider enquiry. We can then

consider its terms of reference. It might be useful as producing reasons

for rejecting local income tax.

M.Edn But internal enquiry, with access to estimates etc., wd. be better.

M.H.L.G. Even a survey dangerous: but I want to be helpful. Shall I leave

door ajar for enquiry, without encouraging it?

Ch.Duchy. Yes.

M.Def. I agree. Survey: in light of it, consider whether any case for

enquiry. Survey to be on impact: not on hardship.

P.M. Agree.

6. Bank Staff Associations (oral).

M.Lab. N.U.B.E. have complained to I.L.O. that some banks‟ staff

assocns are not free unions. ? Enquiry. If so, do it ourselves – not via

I.L.O. mission to this country. Banks do not object: and it wd.

improve negotiating machinery for bank staff assocns.

P.M. Agree.

7. Tribunals of Enquiry: Refusal to disclose evidence. (oral).

M.W.P. Imprisonment of two journalists raises v. difficult issues. Can

we give public opinion a lead?

L.Ch. Mustn‟t put Press in privileged position as regards obtaining

informn or defying a T. of Enquiry. Must consider v. carefully before

committing ourselves.

Home Sec. And discourage any idea that I will intervene to remit sentences.

I can only consider this, if new facts come to light.

First Secy I sympathise with reporters: but Govt. can‟t override the courts.

P.M. Issues are v. wide – priests, doctors etc. Be v. careful to avoid

any impression that Govt. will do something. Defer commitment

until tribunal‟s report is available.
