C.C.(63)4. 17 January 1963. 11 a.m.

[Enter Ch. Whip., M.F. &amp; Power : M/S.F.O. (Godber)

1. Industrial Disputes. (oral).

M.F.P. Agreement reached : similar to Ely. Cl‟s offer before Christmas.

2½d. plus prody. bonus, though differently calculated. But a 3 yr. agreement. Unions dissatisfied : and unofficial go slow may persist. Must consider action to curb unofficial action of this kind. Will consult M. Lab.

M.Lab. A success – even in terms of incomes policy. Will consult M.F.P. if unofficial action persists.

Unions have asked for public enquiry into circs. of dispute – slowness of negns. and ? influence of Govt. This may peter out.

P.M. But be ready with answer if pressed. Dangerous precedent to concede enquiry.

Ch.Exch. 3 yr. agreement averaging 4% v. valuable for incomes policy.

Home Sec. No case now for emergency action unless weather and/or go slow gets worse.

M.F.P. Agree : but may become necessary. If so, we are ready – both to limit consumption and to draft addl. labour.

Ch.Duchy. If go slow persists, the agreement cd. rebound against us.

If so, is our only action to be to restrict public demand?

M.Lab. Dangerous to import troops. ? Imprison the Communists.

M.F.P. I agree. If troops, an official strike. This wd. be illegal : but it wdn‟t turn on the light!

P.M. We may have to look as if we are doing something. Home Sec. to consider with M. Lab and M.E.P. and to report. Prosecn. for criminal conspiracy v. doubtful : but don‟t exclude. Law Officers to advise – on ambit of law : and consider change of law.

[Exit M.F.P.

2. Parly. Business. (oral).

Ch.Duchy. Business (as in statement) for two weeks after reassembly.

3. Foreign Affairs. (oral).

a) Yemen &amp; S. Arabia.

M/S. F.O. No strong reactions to yesterday‟s announcement of resumption of dip. relations with S.A.

b) Togo.

Normal conditions being restored after assassn. of Prest. Olympio.

Defer recognition until clearer. No evidence of Ghanaian complicity.

c) Nuclear tests.

No sure informn. on our participation in (secret) U.K. - S. Union discussions.

4. Common Market. (oral).

P.M. de G‟s Press confce. an attempt to compel us to break. Our quiet reaction has confused French, who will now try to bring five to heel, or risk collapse of E.E.C. If so, onus of break must be seen to be on them and to be based on point of principle which they shd. have taken when we first applied for membership. But Five are not strong.

M/S. F.O. U.S. cd. increase pressure on Adenauer : but might make A.

even more susceptible to French insinuation of Anglo-Saxon domination. But we must back Schroeder against Adenauer, whose power will wane as (already announced) date of retirement approaches.

5. Congo. (oral).

M/S.F.O. Tshombe‟s statement. Offered to go to Leopoldville and may go today. Position confused, as regards both discussions and posn. in Katanga.

We shd. keep in background.

Br. Embassy in E‟ville recently stormed. Central Govt. have now apologised in response to our strong protest and may now send mission to London to meet our Govt.

P.M. Our hands clean. U.S. propose a W. Paper showing this.

F. Sec. shd. consider.

6. Central African fedn. C(63)1&amp;4.

First Secy. My main purpose to ascertain views of Terrl. Govts. on future assocn. Fedl Govt. still hope for some fedl assocn.

We may have to limit ourselves to economic links at least initially. Welensky will be dissatisfied; and we may face threat of force. G. field may support this for sake of enforcing order in isolated S.Rh. But he is also aware of advantage of link with copper revenues of N. Rh : and this may detach him from Welensky. I must try to persuade R .W.

of this, with such promises of political link as I can : but emphasising that any solution must rest on consent.

Nyasaland may share economic link after independence is assured.

S of S C.R.O. W. won‟t resort to force now that S. Rh. is against him.

First Secy. Separate states will emerge. N.Rh. and Ny. will become independent.

Shd. we grant independence to SRh? V. awkward : don‟t decide now. V. doubtful precedent (S.Africa!) for giving independence to a minority.

P.M. On publication of W.P. summarise arguments for and against. V. arguable – particularly Lyttelton on p.5, Swinton on p.6 and formal minutes on p.6. ? Better to say that, whatever may have been said and intended, circs. change than to claim that what was said meant something different.

L.P.S. Even Greenfield recognised our ultimate right to legislate as we wish. Publish : but rest on this right.

Ch.Exch. Agree. Circs. change.

S of S C.R.O. Agree. Cyprus is a precedent.

L.Ch. But don‟t concede breach of pledge. No such breach, since whole discussion was on whether one of four local Govts. cd. destroy Fedn. at time of review. This is quite different from allegations now made against us.

Emphasise this – as well as change of circs.

If a real pledge, everybody wd. have wanted to embody it in constn., rather than conceal it. W. has distorted the discussions and has cheated.

S of S C.R.O. Also emphasise that discussions were about ending of constn. – not about succession, wh. is different and is ground of W.‟s charge.

L.Ch. Discussions covered both : see Eastwood.

P.M. Confce. was concerned, at this point, with stability of Fedn. in relation to its public credit. Natural to emphasise intention of permanency – even at review.

But when translated into Act, no means under our constn. of making Fedn. irrevocable. We did not go even as far as decn of intention to preamble to Conn. of Australia Act.

Circs. have now changed : and our pledges of intention can no longer be fulfilled. Present it this way : don‟t try to prove too much.

First Secy. Also emphasise discussion was between four Govts. not us. Even

Greenfield recognised our ultimate right to legislate.

Ch.Duchy. But don‟t get into contest of successive interpretations with W.

Present as P.M. proposes.

P.M. ? Wiser not to publish confidential records. But make no secret of intentions at the time : and justify action by change of circs.

L.Ch. But record makes it clear that discussion was limited to what four (not five) Govts. cd. do at the review. Posn. of fifth Govt. was reserved – and so acknowledged by Greenfield.

P.M. But formal minute goes further and includes fifth Govt. i.e. us. This is what Press will fasten on.

First Secy. I favour publicn. – to anticipate pressure from Fedn. Govt. and our own backbenchers. Record will be deliberately “leaked”, if we don‟t publish.

If so, base our case on para.6 : and redraft accordingly, retaining last part of para.4. and perhaps para.9.

M.Health. Watch para.6. Don‟t imply – as it does – that there was a pledge in ‟53.

L.Ch. Right order : our constl. posn. : change of circs : args about pledge.

P.M. No. Put pledges first : and then explain that if a pledge as R.W. maintains, it wd. have been made public and included in Act. End with reassertion of change of circs. and our constl. right to legislate.

L.Ch. I will redraft and see if Chandos etc. agree.

Ch.Duchy. An improvement. But any publicn risks an indefinite battle with R.W.

Let us see amended text before deciding on publicn.

M.Def. I agree.

M. w‟out P. If publish, do so before pressure mounts here.

First Sec. Not while I am in Salisbury!

P.M. Best to publish on day of debate or very shortly before.

First Secy. to redraft, with L.Ch. and M. w‟out P‟folio. Watch order of argument : draw reader on from formal minute to verbatim record : then demolish latter.
