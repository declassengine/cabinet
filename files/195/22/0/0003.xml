C.C.(63)3. 10 January 1963. 11.a.m.

1. Prime Minister. (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip.

First Secy. Congratulate P.M. on 6th anniversary of accession to office and 69th birthday. [Quite untrue : 10 Feb!]

P.M. Thank for v. graceful expression of “Morituri te salutamus”.

2. Foreign Affairs (oral).

a) Congo.

F.Sec. Tshombe back in E‟ville. U.N. refused to meet him. His initial statement satisfactory but offset by subsequent press confce. repeating threats to negotiations. U.N. put under house arrest.

He has now escaped. If he destroys the dams and U.M. plant he will destroy 70% of wealth of Congo.

We must leave it to Belgians U.N. local command in chaos.

Guerrilla war now v. near.

Home Sec. Initial (satisfactory) statement made at our insistence, must have been made in bad faith. We shd. now write him off.

F.Sec. I don‟t dissent. But - ?

L.P. We warned both Tshombe and U.N. of folly of their respective courses. Now keep out, even if not v. heroic course.

Ch.Duchy. V. well : but own back benches regard Tshombe as symbol of resistance to unwise U.N. policy.

P.M. We can‟t do anything – except refuse to pay.

L.Ch. Validity of resolutions authorising U.N. action v. arguable both ways.

F.Sec. Possibility of reconciliation between T. and U. Thant not entirely excluded; still a loophole.

P.M. We‟re not in charge of U.N. operation; we have done our best to mediate (unlike French and Russians who have washed their hands of it); and we must now wait and see. Sitn. may be affected decisivelly if U.N. change sides in order to preserve assets.

Our purpose is to keep Russians out : but risk of their return (wh. was origin of U.N. intervention) may have been over estimated. Both Tshombe and Adoula unreliable. Wait and see who wins.

F.Sec. But a U.N. victory could only be temporary : if T. returned it would all break out again.

b) Saudi Arabia.

F.Sec. Hope to resume dip. relns. with S.A. week tomorrow. No conditions on Buraimii.

c) Indonesia.

F.Sec. Ind. beginning to be interested in Timor and Borneo border, which they are over flying, I am considering probable U.S. reaction to invasion of Timor (Port. colony); and will report our own capability of reaction to attack on Borneo.

3. Central Af. Federation. (oral)

First Sec. Have prepared W.P. rebutting Welensky‟s charges of Breach of Faith on 1953 pledges. But defer publicn until I return from visit and have consulted other Govts. concerned.

L.Ch. There were no pledges. Boyd not at relevant meeting; and Chandos‟ words were not a pledge. Welensky has published only extracts and has distorted them.

P.M. Then deal with Opposition as First Secy. proposes.

4. Pensions and National Insurance C(63)2. [Enter M.P.N.I.

M.P.N.I. 10/- will have more impact than 7/6; should suffice for rest of this Parlt.; and should restore relationship of pensions to earnings to 21.3% ie, nearly to 1946 level.

If so, increase contribns. by 1/1. Earnings have increased betwn. Oct. 60 and Oct. 62 by 9.2%. 1/1 is increase of almost 10%.

For many it will be smaller than increase in earnings. Therefore tolerable. For self employed 2/2. This could be shaded to 2/- which, with consequentials, would yield £4-5 m. surplus, (ie. what we wd. have with 7/6 increase).

Ch.Exch. V. generous increase, in relation to earnings (wh. wd. justify 5/-+).

But accept : also shading for self empd.

5/- or 6/- p.a. Nat. Assce.? Re-examine this (which isn‟t in Bill).

First Secy. Agree. But N.A. shd. be 6/-.

Ch.Duchy. I agree. 6/-, plus 4/- recently agreed, equates with N.I. 10%.

N.A. shd. not be less than N.I.

M.P.N.I. It wd. still lag behind; but ratio before last increase wd. be maintained.

M. Edn. Higher basic rate increase, higher average rate increase. Remember this : you may bring in a new class of beneficiary.

M.Lab. Support 6/-. for Ch. Duchy‟s reasons.

Home Sec. Para.7 = 3/8 more a week. Is benefit increase proportionate?

M.P.N.I. Yes. Span of contribn. income increased from £25 to £18.

M.H.L.G. If so, L.A.‟s will protest against complexity.

M.Health. But better than altve. – stamp increase in everybody‟s contribn.

M.W.Pfolio. Do we stress the benefits/earnings rates as a new principle?

Ch.Exch. No : no merit in returning to 1946.

P.M. Agree : but rub in our pledge to let old have more than due share of increase related to rise in real earnings.

L.P.S. Let N.A. take effect at same time as N.I.

Ch.Exch. Agree. 27th May for both.

M.P.N.I. War pensions at same time, though it cd. be a month earlier.

But anticipation wd. be embarrassing in relation to other benefits.

P.M. Presentation : Introduce a reassembly : but Cttee. to consider any statement about a review on differentiation.

[Exit M.P.N.I.

5. Employment. (oral).

a) Unemployment.

M.Lab. Count on Monday. Weather may make increase abnormally high. Peak may be in Jan. rather than Feb. But probably still below 3%.

b) Power stations.

M.Lab. Signs of unions seeking a way out. May accept 2½ all round but go to arbitrn. on 3/6 for skilled men.

6. Europe : Common Market Negotiations. (oral)

L.P.S. Tempo of negns. has varied. In autumn it relaxed until transl period brought new deadlock. But many individual problems dealt with in this interval.

Five now want to settle finally. French remain difficult but may move if Five stand firm and we are accommodating.

On issues outstanding :-

a) domestic agriculture is crucial and pre-condition of advance.

b) Others (tariff issues) must wait until concessions can be justified as price of final settlement.

Settlement on agric. will be difficult : much bargaining.

On tariffs, no major individual interest left, but general C‟wealth interest. Must bargain.

C‟wealth agric. must do our best, partic. for N.Z.

Domestic agric : Mansholt Cttee. have helped to Educate the Six and to isolate problems – change of prices : price bracket for wheat; transl period : intervention : horticulture – as prepn. for package deal.

Also fin. Regns. : prospects of agreement good – wh. wd. help both domestic and C‟wealth agric.

H – K and Fedn. outstanding.

Institutions; balance of voting will be difficult as regards new members other than ourselves (who will have equality with Six). We and E.F.T.A. can never veto rest of Community but two great Powers may be able to veto.

Participation formula - for interval between initialling and ratification – shd. be left to end. But our full participn. is accepted.

Posn. of neutrals may be difficult.

Euratom and E.C.S.C. going well.

Go forward, enlisting support of Five, - wh. we shan‟t get unless we are resolute.

M.A.F.F. Detailed discussn. in Mansholt Cttee. has been useful, as illustrating diffy. of injecting into E.C.E. our system, based on market price below producer price. This demands long transl. period in which we can change balance of our agric. Report will merely state their views and ours but in non critical way.

We can now see elements of a settlement; but we must safeguard :-

i) gradual transition

I ii) method of transition must preserve 1957 Act

iii) better long term assurances for livestock producers.

iv) special treatment for horticulture

To get these we must be flexible on length of transl. period provided that arrangements during it are right. This will call for a lot of behind scenes work, wh. the Five seem ready to do.

Objective – no isolated settlement for agric. but final package deal; wh. we cd. justify to Parlt.

First Secy. Will consider in more detail at my Cttee. But fourchette for wheat v. dangerous : for our wheat producers and Australian.

Price may affect volume of imports considerably.

Also, suggn. that we shd. subsidise imports into E.C.E. very dangerous politically.

L.P.S. Fourchette : lowest = price of greatest producer.

highest “ “ “ importer.

Move to harmonised price in 1970 in 2 periods : in first by unanimous vote (and therefore veto), to second by qualified majority.

But Germans are difficult : must somehow hold them until second period. In that period, however, unknown factors will operate and decline in Germany and Italian prodn.: rise in our prodn.; impact of world commodity agreements, etc. therefore don‟t consider fourchette in isolation.

Com.Secy. If fourchette maintained, makes nonsense of Six‟s undertakg. to provide reasonable outlet for o‟seas producers. This may be a point on wh. we may have to ask Six to reconsider.

7. N.E. England. (oral).]

P.M. Refer to L.P.‟s appointment in N.E. Good wishes of Cabinet.
