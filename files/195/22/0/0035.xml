C.C. (63) 35. 28 May 1963. 11.30 a.m.

1. Foreign Affairs (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip: M/S. F.O. (Dundee)

a) Iraq.

M/S. F.O. Iraqi Govt. have detained Nasser‟s supporters &amp; shot Kassem‟s supporters. Kurdish trouble (fomented by S. Union) may be renewed, if so, Iraqi Govt. may be weakened. They have welcomed our arms deal.

b) Africa.

A.A. Confce now over. Nkrumah behaved badly: Obote even worse, particularly over S. Rh. Resn on S. Rh. only invites us not to concede indepce to minority white Govt. and pledges support to legitimate opposition to this.

c) Indonesia.

U.S. have sent Wyatt &amp; Levy to see Sukarno in Tokyo. Hope for settlement on 60/40 basis. S. may not accept this. U.S. have undertaken not to settle without safeguarding Shell. We have undertaken that Shell will play if a reasonable settlement can be reached. Indonesia will try to separate U.S. &amp; U.K.

2. Parliament (oral).

Ch. Duchy As in statement.

3. Members‟ Travel (oral).

Ch. Sec. Add “home to London” for wives, to proposed constituency concession for wives.

M.A.F.F. Unwise to reopen controversy about Members‟ remuneration.

Ch. Duchy No: quite separate.

Ch. Whip Constituency for wives was an afterthought. Real point is London.

L.P. Anything for Commons must be given to Lords as well.

Ch. Sec. Watch tax position. Wife is not holder of office: therefore concession wd. not be emolument of office.

P.M. Start with constituency journeys. If pressure develops, reconsider London journeys. At that point reconsider Lords position.

P.B.T. Watch reaction on business men coming to London. They would like to bring their wives tax free.

P.M. Defer decision. Cttee of Minister shd. examine.

Ch. Whip I have “sold” all 3 legs to Oppn. I am sorry.

P.M. Proceed as I suggested. Cttee. shd. report to first Cab. after Whitsun recess.

4. Military Aid to India. C(63) 92 and tels.

[Enter M. Avn: S of S. Air: C.D.S.

Com. Sec. CODEL N.A.T.O. 84 formula shd. suffice. U.S. will go ahead with air defence, whether we do or not. Unfortunate if we stand aside. But U.S. anxious to avoid too precise a commitment; training mission has now superseded air umbrella. Joint training exercises, with no military commitment, are well established &amp; understood. India will accept this provided that I. personnel participate and that their radar capability is increased (wh. U.S. will do). This means pulling I. some way from non-alignment. Therefore approve.

S of S. Air I agree. But I. has only day fighter capability: how blur this with night fighter capability wh. only we have? Perhaps arrange Javelin squn to be in transit to F.E. and to stop off for short time in I. But can‟t pretend that we are training I. in night fighting.

Cost (including Br. Ground staff) might be £200,000. But largely notional.

C.D.S. I agree. Blur as best we can – on grounds that night squns can be used for day fighting as well.

L. Ch. But CODEL 49 (penult. Para.) – an air defence offer. This doesn‟t square with CODEL 84 and our blurring techniques.

P.M. Make it conditional on our blurring, particy since I. wouldn‟t accept U.S. explanation. But if U.S. insist on “defence offer” we may have to stand aside. F. Sec. agrees: see his minute of 25 May.

L.P. But it has no military value: and it is a disincentive to I. to agree with P. on sub-continental defence.

Com. Sec. But P. wd. prefer this to supply of aircraft.

M.H. Blurring v. dubious. It may be means of U.S. forcing us, step by step, to stationing squns in India.

P.M. Possibly. But they have moved a long way: and we shd. now agree, provided that our interpretn is accepted – because China will notice.

First Secy I agree.

S of S. Air And play down all weather capability of radar wh. U.S. will provide.

P.M. Rest of aid?

Ch. Sec. Not impossible: though heavy addn to Malaya commitment.

Com. Sec. To be confined to U.K. stocks or prodn or U.K. training etc.

Ch. Sec. Will examine urgently on this basis.

M. Avn I. our best customer for arms exports. Therefore keep a foot in this door.

Com. Sec. I will not mention a figure to T.T.K.: but will talk on basis of para. 5. And figure in mind will be as in para. 6.

Ch. Sec. We must get away from 50/50 basis with U.S.

Com. Sec. And emphasise my para. 7.

5. Southern Rhodesia (oral).

First Secy I have warned Field that indepce means U.K. legn: if this is to be well received and S. Rh. is to remain in C‟wealth, some constl advance is essential. F. will consult Cab. about improvement of A roll (rather than amdt of B roll). Will also liberalise B roll franchise. Still wants abolition of cross voting. Prepared to consider Constl Council alt‟ve: and to go on eroding land Appt Act. He wants to be helpful: but still refuses to attend dissoln confce without decl. of U.K. intent on indepce. Prepared to fight on this? Will report again on Thursday. F. may not be able to carry his Cab.; but he does not want unilateral indepce.

P.M. F. will want to take our proposals with him in writing. We must be v. careful what we put down at that stage.

Ch. Duchy Can we leave things as they are: and let process of erosion do the trick?

L.P. What wd. be implicn of a disorderly dissoln? Are they a lever against S. Rh?

First Secy S. Rh. now so keen on indepce that they will sacrifice economic interests.

L. Ch. Don‟t let Field play us along until dissoln confce is on us.

Com. Sec. Beware of any exact commitment on our part to be satisfied with any particular set of reforms. We must play him along and still try to get S. Rh. to dissoln confce.

P.M. First Secy to put memm to Cab. about proposals wh. wd. be just, acceptable to our Party and tolerable to rest of C‟wealth. We wdn‟t necessarily put this to Field now: but we must be clear in our own minds.

Com. Sec. And, at right point, put settlement to rest of C‟wealth. Don‟t commit our posn on paper prematurely.

P.M. I agree, keep our hands free – even if this means that F. may return to Rh. and then break by letter and refuse to attend dissoln confce. Perhaps try to agree with Field suitable statement on his departure.

[Exeunt Com. Sec: M/S. F.O.

6. Legislative Programme 1963-64. C(63) 89.

Ch. Duchy List B. contains main political measures. Robbins report a doubtful starter. On A2, Air Corpns (Borrowing) must now be A1. Note provision for renewal of C‟wealth Immigrants.

First Secy Central Africa Bill may have to be this Session.

L.P. This may mean autumn overspill – for Lords. Or drop a Bill.

Ch. Duchy List B. not too bad politically. Keep up pace of policy clearance and drafting instruction. And keep programme light.

L. Ch. Adminn of Justice (London) shd. be introduced early.

Hire Purchase v. controversial: therefore get Bill drafted quickly, to give Legn Cttee plenty of time.

Ch. Secy Robbins report will be late: but we shall know by summer what will be in it. It wd. be a good Bill.
