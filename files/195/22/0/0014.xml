C.C. (63) 14 28th February, 1963 10.30.am

1 Parly Business (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip: M/S. C.R.O.

Ch. Duchy. As in statement.

2. Foreign Affairs (oral).

(c) Yemen.

F.S. Small action on Yemen frontier: eviction of Yemenis from Federal territory.

Y. attempt at air reprisal against Br. medical post.

Bunche visiting Yemen on behalf of U.N.

P.M. Frontier forays endemic for years. Play it down publicly.

F.S. Yes: but remember U.A.R. support Y.

L.P.S. And Y. now looking for trouble.

P.M. Will consider further, with F. &amp; C. Secs., a basis for further policy.

3. Farm Price Review. C (63) 32.

Ch. Sec. As in memn. Three problems:-

(a) Any increase in price of milk? Last increase did not result in any redn in prodn. (b). Farmers‟ own scheme not yet considered: but shd. W.P. undertake to consider it? (c) Can we afford to retreat from original cut (overall) of £11m to virtual no change.

When Exch. subsidy is rising by £40m this year and even this retreat does not guarantee an agreed settlement?

M.A.F.F. N.F.U.‟s can represent Govt. as harsh. 1960 W.P. said farmers shd. have fair share of increased efficiency each year. Last year we took whole of efficiency plus £5m. Costs increasing next year by £12m for review purposes: if review takes £2m, pig scheme rearrangement takes £6m. Total of £20m. This leaves +£5m. Offset by £-5m last year. Result – no benefit from efficiency over 2 years.

Even £-2m relieves Exch. by £171/2m. (excluding milk in schools).

Most of increases will be borne by consumer: and increased milk price will operate for only 2-3 months.

Pig &amp; egg reforms outside review: but more important.

Milk consumption rising. But many producers going out of business. Increased production now to balance with increased prodn.

Producers have had to carry extra 5d a gallon over last 5 years in extra costs &amp; reduced returns. This wd. justify extra 1d on price: but too drastic. Compromise on 1/2d. Even this risky and may not

yield agreed settlement: bad prelude to long term reforms wh. I have in mind. Will report further.

Ch. Exch. £1.8 is limit. Next year Exch. subs. is £360m: net farm income will be £400m. ie. Exch. contributing 90%. Absurb.

M./S C.R.O. Old C.Wealth will look for larger cuts in subsidies: and N.Z., whose butter quota we have cut, will resent milk proposal.

S.of S.Scot. Support M.A.F.F. Rise in real farmers‟ incomes has lagged far behind rise in price index. This is no inducement to greater efficiency: and it is bad politics.

Ch. Sec. “Efficiency increase” is arbitrary concept. Net farm incomes rose by £75m in last 4 yrs. Even 1/2d on milk will stimulate new prodn: wh. we don‟t want.

First Secy Common Market was a strain on our political relations with farmers, who control many marginal seats. Extra 1/2d milk for a few months is small price to pay to retain their support.

But whole policy of support must thereafter be re-examined. For this we must get as near to our agreed settlement as we can.

Ch. Exch. But to give way to pressure on issue wh. has no economic justificn is equally bad prelude to reform.

M.Lab. As a milk producer, I support First Secy. In any event 1/2d can‟t reverse downward trend of milk profitability: but it may just hold balance of prodn &amp; consumptn.

But reject N.F.U. scheme: don‟t pay people for not producing.

Home Sec. N.U. content with schedule.

On politics, farmers‟ support less important to Consve Party than that of higher earners in industrial sectors. The towns resent the constant rise in food prices. Even if we must compromise on this occasion for sake of long term reforms, don‟t exaggerate.

L.Ch. Big cut is on barley. But late sowings (weather) may have to be barley.

Ch. Sec. But too much barley already!

M.A.F.F. Not only 1/1d: another 3d taken off by cuts in ploughing &amp; fertiliser fronts. If we were within sight of agreed review, I wd. propose easement here.

Ch. Sec. If milk concessions made, barley concession wd. eliminate £1.8m; and result wd. be increase to subsidies!

Ch. Duchy. On politics, endorse First Secy. But Annex A out for M. Lab‟s reasons.

F.S. Agree. Socially, land shd. not fall out of cultvn and rural popn shd. not drift to towns.

P.M. Agricre is always irrational: our own policy much less important than world influences. All figures v. speculative. M.A.F.F. shd. seek agreed settlement this year – including 1/2d on milk, but no bonus scheme – as prelude to reform.

M.A.F.F. Can‟t wholly reject bonus scheme as possible basis of discussion? But will play it down as much as possible.

4. Northern Ireland: Future of Shorts and Harland. C (63) 24, 28 &amp; 30.

{Enter M. Avn &amp; S.of S. Air.

P.M. Review of existing sitn (as in brief). Three courses (also as in brief!).

Must consult N.I. Ministers. But which course do we prefer?

Home Sec. One of two main firms in N.I. We are pledged to try to maintain it as a balanced aircraft unit. Unempt in N.I. as a whole 11.2%.

I was not consulted about Beverley/Hastings replacement decision.

N.I. Govt. now pressing for 10 more Belfasts and sub-contracting for V.C.10‟s. and for B/H. replacement if not Belfast. V. strong pressure from N.I. M.P.‟s who may even vote against Govt. on N.I. issues.

Trading estate absurd. Shorts cannot be closed with 11.2% unempt.

Ch. Sec. Trading estate was meant to be helpful. There is no long-term future for Shorts in sub-contracting. Altve remedy must be found, albeit v. expensive, in order to attract other industry – of wh. Shorts might be a continuing element. Worth discussing confidentially with N.I. Govt. See para 44 of Ismay Jacob report.

M.Def. Belfast not suitable for O.R. 351. A strategic aircraft: not a tactical transport. We have enough of former: we now want latter.

Replacement of B/H. essential: and streamlined O.R. 351, made by Hawkers is the answer. Hawkers have designed it, on most modern lines.

Shorts will never design another aircraft. But we must subcontract – eg. on O.R. 351 – at extra cost. Even so, trading estate a better long term solution.

Home Sec. Politically fatal to say – even privately to N.I. Govt. – that we propose to diminish scope of S. &amp; H. and convert to trading estate.

They have several estates already: and several empty factories.

M.Avn Shorts, as at present, not suitable for Tr. estate. Everything wd. have to be changed. Sub-contracting will suffice till 1970: unwise to try

to foresee, before about 1965/66, future of aircraft industry from 1970.

Home Sec. I will mention Tr. estate personally to Brookeborough, without committing H.M.G., as official discussions would.

P.M. Can‟t order Belfasts we don‟t need. Design team must die. But keep prodn going with sub-contracting: and review in few years‟ time.

Don‟t put forward tr. estate as altve plan: but keep it in mind and explore gently. M.Def. must give Home Sec. a reasoned case for entrusting O.R. 351 to Hawkers: he shd. give it to Brookeborough and N.I. M.P.‟s before decision is announced in Defence Debate – preferably by statement after Qns on Tuesday, before debate resumed.

M.Edn. Home sec. shd. also disillusion N.I. Govt. about continuing as they are. That report shows that they must be ready to look forward and to changes.

Home Sec. I agree. Some hopeful signs already.

[Exeunt M.Def; M.Avn; S.of S. Air.

5. National Economic Development Council: Retraining &amp; Redundancy. C. (63) 31.

[Enter M.P.N.I.

Ch. Exch. N.E.D.C. more important in post Brussels period. This is their first practical proposal. But Govt. initiative must be conditional on support of both sides of industry. This applies to both subjects; and on this basis we can take the lead on both.

M.Lab. Recent W.P. well received. Might introduce Bill in this session, as earnest of Govt. initiative. Retraining allces and retraining centres: improvements under discussn with Ch. Exch. Redundancy needs discussn: but I must resist its incorporation (via severance pay concept) to annex Contracts of Empt Bill.

Ch. Duchy. No room for either Bill in current session. Best to introduce at beginning of next session (and winter).

M.Edn. More retraining means more premises. Present techl college programme wd. need to be enlarged.

Ch. Exch. Industry shd. contribute in this respect too.

S.of S. Scot. Support M.Edn. We must both work with M.Lab.

M. Health Redundancy, as something different from ordinary unempt, is unreal – except in retrospect.

Ch. Exch. I agree. Needs discussion – wh. we shan‟t get unless we give a lead.

P.M. Yes. To restore our position, we have to expand economy and this entails retraining &amp; redundancy schemes on large scale. Popular appreciation of economic realities, even in incomes policy, is growing and must be encouraged – provided that both sides of industry cooperate.

Must be presented as part of national plan, to be inaugurated in Budget.

Ch. Exch. Agree. Initiative here will mobilise public support for incomes policy.

[Exit M.PN.I.

6. Representation of the Vatican in the United Kingdom. C (63) 26

F.S. Good moment for change: popular Pope. We wd. like Interviews: this wd. be no better than Minister, equivalent to Iron Curtain countries.

Nuncio might be better: but this might mean Br. Embassy in Vatican.

Home Sec. Personally don‟t dissent. But dog sleeping: don‟t rouse it with General Election in sight. In any event, consult Archp of Cant.

P.M. And N.I. Govt. I will ask Archp etc. S. of S. to see Moderator.

Let us think it over a bit.

L.P.S. Better to do it while public opinion quiet, i.e. now.

Home Sec. But don‟t revive campaign that Common Market was attempt to bring U.K. under Rome.

Ch. Duchy I favour it – and now i.e. before Prayer Book becomes live issue later in year.

M. Edn. I agree. But if so we shd. then exert pressure against treatment of Protestants in Spain, which wd. be popular with young people there.

P.M. Reconsider next week, on basis of plan to be prepared – timing, status, prior to consultations etc.

[Exeunt First Secy and M.A.F.F.

7. United Nations: Financing of Peacekeeping Operations C(63) 29.

F.S. U.N. working group to consider Congo &amp; Israel operations (? and W. Irian) in 1963 and thereafter, on 4 March.

For 1963, compulsory contribn seems inevitable. We can justify on grounds that Israel opn is essential &amp; Congo opn is being changed to development.

But only if prospect of reasonable basis after 1964 and if French &amp; Russians can be bought into line. If they continue to default, they lose their votes in 1964. That is point to exert pressure. Hence point of para 10 (iii) wh. is more likely than 10 (ii) to bring France &amp; Russia into line.

U.S. becoming v. restive: addn reason for deferring crunch till 1964, when pressure on U.S. Govt. will reach maximum.

L.Ch. I stressed before Intl Court that Congo opn was undertaken at initiative of Congo Govt. Para 10 (iii) implies an obligation to contribute: how can we justify this in 1963 but go back on it, if necessary, in 1964?

L.P. I agree. No clear principle. Contribn shd. be either voluntary or compulsory.

To make them both will be to fall between two schools.

L.Ch. Consider situation in S. Rh., wh. wd. not be at S.R. invitation. Shd. we want to be compelled to contribute?

F.S. But I want time – until U.S. resentment comes to boil and France &amp; Russia are in danger of losing votes. Then have a public row.

But I will consult L.Ch. on wisdom of 10 (iii) and bring back to Cab.

Meanwhile stall in U.N.
