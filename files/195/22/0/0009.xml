C.C.(63)9. 31 January 1963. 10.30 a.m.

[Enter Ch.Whip

1. Parly. Business : post Common Market economic policy.

Ch. Duchy. Statement. Debate on Common Market. Budget 3. April : announce today.

L.P.S. Increased C‟wealth (i.e. protectionist) emphasis incompatible with Kennedy round. Any C‟wealth initiative must be realistic.

Com.Sec. Agree. It must be bilateral, tailored to circs. of each case : not collective or implying that our market for C‟wealth is open indefinitely.

F.Sec. If so, must reduce C‟wealth pressure here by getting Menzies and Holyoaks to endorse our line.

L.P.S. Altve. proposal – omnibus confce. of E.F.T.A. E.E.C. C‟wealth etc. – means G.A.T.T. and we can easily divert that to Kennedy round.

P.M. Maintain warm relations with individual C‟wealth countries : but avoid any collective C‟wealth agreement (wh. wd. be economically unrealistic); and concentrate on tariff reductions and any measures wh. will expand trade.

F.Sec. Also avoid continuance of uncertainty – any suggn. that we might go back to Brussels quite soon.

M.Trans. ? Maintain relations with French otherwise – eg. Channel Tunnel and shipping arrangements. Proposal to meet here, under my chairmanship, is a change from agreement to meet in Paris and a deliberate snub to France (who will probably stay away).

P.M. If they are unanimous, London. If not stick to France and meeting in Paris. Don‟t cancel this out of pique.

M.Trans. But the others won‟t go to Paris.

P.M. Then leave it to them to decide. Some other capital.

Ch.Exch. Heavy run on £ yesterday. $90 m. to support rate.

May have to let rate sink to 2.79.

L.P.S. Our enemies are ruthless and will damage our economy to utmost. Fr. commercial banks‟ holdings of £ v. large.

M.A.F.F. Agree. France will now try to prove Br. economy not strong enough to enter C.M.

M.Edn. Revive our plan for intl. liquidity.

P.M. We need a new appraisal of our position but brief and quick.

On shipping confce. leave to majority to decide.

2. Foreign Affairs (oral).

a) Indonesia.

F.Sec. Threatened Indonesian infiltration of Borneo now not imminent. ?Stand down alerted troops. Will discuss with M.Defence.

Have told Nehru to restrain Sokarno.

Philippines refuse to abandon claim to N. Borneo : intend to divide spoils with Indonesia.

V. important to hold Sokarno somehow.

Ch.Sec. Reimpose control on strategic exports to Indonesia?

F.Sec. Probably not : but will consider.

Philippines fear Chinese minority in Malaysia, wh. will overthrow Union and bring Chinese influence within reach of Philippines.

They cdn‟t hold N.B. themselves : but they won‟t see this.

Legally their claim v. doubtful : dormant for over 80 years.

But they will now try to enlist Sokarno‟s support, agitate in U.N. etc.

P.M. Must accelerate establishment of Malaysia as much as possible.

b) S.Arabia and Yemen.

F.Sec. S.A. beginning to move towards republicans in Yemen, if only to get U.A.R. out. Sallal has same objective. Some prospect of reconciliation between republicans and royalists. If so, must reconsider our means of protecting our interests in S. Arabia.
