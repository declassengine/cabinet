C.C. (63) 41 24th June 1963. 5 p.m. H/C.

1. Kenya. C(63) 105. [Enter Ch. Whip.

P.M. Proposed to make K. indept in December in light of E.A. Fedn.

If so:-

1) Impact on Rhodesia.

2) Prior problems – Zanzibar &amp; N.F.D.

3) Consequentials – constl adjustments (K.A.D.U. etc.); European economic interests; expatriate staffs; financial aid; defence.

Col. Sec. Must encourage E.A. Fedn – real community of interest and practice. But anxious K. shd. not be separately independent for long, before joining Fedn. Must support this: best safeguard against local Kenyan tribal politics. This points to 12 Dec. for K. indepce: Fedn a week later.

Few constl changes required – expecially since K.A.N.U. will want to go back on some of regional (K.A.D.U.) safeguards. Land settlement all in hand, and necessary finance provided. Expatriate staffs can be dealt with in time. Financial aid will be needed: shortness of time may help us to limit it. Defence – already assumed indepce by mid-64, and troops to be withdrawn by end ‟64. That gave us 6 months; we are now to have 12 months. D. Agt probably unwise: Nigerian precedent discouraging. But we must try to get reasonable staging and overflying rights – and may do so if we keep training arrangements.

Zanzibar: I have settled Coastal Strip on my last visit; it belongs to Kenya, but inhabitants will have right to make represns via Governor to Sultan. In practice he will surrender sovty over C.S.

N.F.D: Kenya Govt. are gripping this. If indept alone, K. wd. find it hard to surrender N.F.D. But a Fedn might be able to cede it to Somalia without too much loss of face. This is realistic recogn of liability which N.F.D. wd. become.

Ch. Exch. Entrenched safeguards for minorities in present Constn must be preserved.

Col. Sec. K.A.D.U. favour Fedn, provded no redn of safeguards for regions. K.A.N.U. may want constn to be more flexible. Europeans have been well treated by new Govt. and are now more confident. They will welcome Fedn.

Ch. Duchy Tanganyika may join Fedn at sacrifice of own indepce. But Uganda?

Col. Sec. It will be all right.

First Secy This will embarrass me qua Nyasaland – whose indepce I can no longer hold up – and, therefore, by repercussion on N. Rh.

But must accept this?

Is it wise to surrender military base in Nairobi? If so, we can‟t assume we shall be able to use Rh. forces for our military needs in southern Africa.

M. Def. N. is our main base in Africa. But we can‟t keep it indefinitiely; only question is when we let it go. After indepce, difficult to use troops – more than once – against wishes of Govt. of Kenya during 12 months withdrawal period. But essential to have addl accn in Aden; and don‟t let para. 7 of draft communiqué be watered down.

D.C.D.S. C of S. concerned about:-

1) relocation of Br. troops in Aden.

2) build up of K.‟s own forces – at least 18 months for this.

3) withdrawal of Br. troops – as rapid as possible.

4) preservation of facilities – staging and o‟flying rights; leave and training camps: W/T stations.

Col. Sec. Go slow on 2): otherwise they wdn‟t give us rights etc. We must now help them to build up own forces.

F. Sec. Must now face Ethiopia and French over Somalia sooner than expected. Fedl system won‟t protect minorities: but gone too far now.

Col. Sec. Fedl system shd. make it more, not less, difficult to water down regional safeguards etc. And Fedl Govt. will have control of troops, in event of civil war. Don‟t imperil good will we have now acquired.

Ch. Duchy European reaction doubtful. But Fedn may overcome this.

V. dangerous if no Fedn: just tolerable if there is.

Bill essential at beginning of next Session.

M.W.P. Make sure Eur. opinion in this country understands.

First Secy ? Delay announcement till end of next week.

Col. Sec. Already leaked in Press.

M.A.F.F. Weak to base action simply on need to enable E.A.F. to be represented at U.N. D. &amp; U. can be already.

L. Ch. Must choose between K. &amp; C. Africa. This will make it almost impossible to refuse indepce to S. Rh.

P.M. Don‟t delay indepce if only for a few months, especially if it wd. cost time. But for sake of C. Africa, hold it until mid-week.

Col. Sec. I will do so, at risk of leak, until Tuesday week.

P.M. Let First Secy take soundings in C. Africa and telegraph reactions and timing to us. Avoid any more accusations of bad faith.

Reasonable – in relation to Mboya – to take a little more time.

Use defence complications as excuse.

2. Resignation of S of S. for War: membership of Privy Council (oral).

P.M. Profumo wants to resign P. C‟ship. No clear precedent, but can be done.

M.H. Unwise: implies that in future precise degree of turpitude must be established before action can be taken. Better to do nothing.

P.M. But he has asked to resign. Otherwise I shd. have done nothing.

L. Ch. But suppose a P.C. commits a serious crime and is imprisoned. How can he remain a P.C.?

M. Def. ? Consult Oppn P.C.‟s.

Home Sec. He can‟t remain a P.C: public opinion wdn‟t understand it.

L. Ch. Action in response to offer to resign is not a precedent for action to take P.C. away. Leaves latter issue open in any future case.

P.M. I will think it over: it is my responsy. Discussion not to be recorded.
