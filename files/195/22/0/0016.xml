C.C.(63) 16 14 March 1963, 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip

Ch. Duchy. As in statement.

2. Foreign Affairs (oral)

a) Syria.

F. Sec. Revolution: Ba‟ath predominant: some pro-Nasser elements in

new Cabinet: follows model of Iraq revn. Have therefore recognised.

Means new threat to S. Arabia.

b) Somalia.

Somalia considering whether to break relations with U.K. If so,

reconsider our military aid.

Main concern – future of N.F.D. Somalis. ?K. Govt. to ask for

discussions in Nairobi. ?Or invoke U.N.

Com. Sec. Seventh region only interim measure: not a solution. No action

possible till after K. elections. Must therefore hold sitn till summer.

Thereafter K. may appreciate uselessness of S. and cost of subsidising

and policing it. They may therefore be ready to get rid of it.

P.M. But must prevent breach of relations during election period. ?Arrange

“discussions” meanwhile – even if only after elections.

E. Sec. Will concert tactics with Com. Sec. Watch risk of oil discovery!

c) Yemen.

F. Sec. Royalists have abandoned South: not making progress in work.

Bunker says Faisal ready to abstain if Nasser will accept

ceasefire and staged withdrawal. Bunker may return to S.A. to

carry this further. Meanwhile no action for us. Get Egypt out first:

and then see.

Com. Sec. Nasser doesn‟t mean to leave Y.

F.Sec. U.S. think he may: and must if S.A. is to be saved.

[Enter F.L.A and Att.Gen.

3. Law of the Sea: U.K. Fishery Limits. C(63) 42 &amp; 47.

L.Ch. Cab. decided to extend to 6 miles: shd. be same for fishery and other

purposes.

Shd. we act this year or not? 1882 Convn terminable on notice; 1839

not. But we can make out a case: and then proceed as in para. 11.

Risk of defeat if challenged in Intl Const: accept this, in order to

avoid delay. Faroese complication not real.

Risk of political impact on France &amp; the Five.

M.A.F.F. a) Timing: Discussed Danish Foreign Minister. Danes leaving it to

Faroese to decide whether to take some new initiative. Must settle

before 28 April, when agreement ends. Don‟t anticipate, by unilateral

action of our own, unilateral action by F. Our deep sea fishermen wd.

resent this. But whether we agree with F. or not we shd. act as

proposed.

b) ?Go further. We though of 6 in context of E.E.C.; go to 6+6

(over period of years) now that deep sea fishermen will not have

advantage in other countries‟ waters.

L.Ch. Defence objections to 6+6: 6 tolerable. Defer decision on this: but

settle whether we act this year or not. Otherwise no time for

consultations between 29 April and 15 May.

Com. Sec. V. important qua C‟wealth.

Can we get law of air (no right of innocent passage for aircraft) in line

with law of sea? 12 mile limit wd. close Med. to our aircraft: and

even 6 mile limit v. awkward at Gib. and H.K.

L.Ch. No hope of this, short of intl confce. Simply do it, and argue

afterwards.

F.L.A. C. of S. accept 6 unwillingly: but not 12.

F.Sec. If 12 for fishery, must it be 12 for terrl waters?

L.Ch. Probably, in terms of decision wh. Intl Court wd. give.

F.Sec. On timing, M.A.F.F. too optimistic about F. Last week in April is

latest date for C‟wealth consultn.

On merits, ? have 3 for terrl water and 3 more for fishery, even though

untidy.

Home Sec. Must allow time for consultn with N.I., Ch. I‟s and I. of Man before

any foreign country or Irish Republic.

P.M. Agree 6 for fishery: act this year if possible: make necy consultations.

S. of S. Agree act this year: Scottish opinion exercised.

Scot.

M.A.F.F. This year or next year matters less than announced decision.

L.Ch. But Faroese will go to 12. Why shd. we wait?

M.A.F.F. Because we shdn‟t exasperate our deep sea fishermen by appearing

to act provocatively.

F.Sec. Agree must wait for F. negotns to end. But consultation is then

merely giving notice.

L.Ch. We can still discuss details during year‟s notice.

P.M. Settle on basis of giving notice in interval between 28 April and

15 May. Ministers responsible for giving notice to consider whether

practicable: if not refer to Cabinet.

F.Sec. Reject Canadian proposal for new confce, wh. wd. be unproductive

and delay our giving notice still further. [Exeunt Att.Gen.

4. Nato Council Meeting C(63) 44. [Enter M.Avn????

F.Sec. Have discussed para. 6 of Nassau Agt with Merchant. Also para. 8 –

mixed manned force in surface or submarine vessels.

We &amp; U.S.regard paras 6 &amp; 8 as complementary in achieving political

objective of binding Germany to Atl. Alliance and forestalling her

wish (and Fr. temptation) to acquire nuclear weapons. Para. 8 force

wd. give her share in policy direction etc; but wd. it destroy

credibility of N.A.T.O. deterrent? Prob. not: cd. be made to work.

U.S. believe G. will demand to construct own missiles or to have

U.S. missiles in Gy, unless mixed manned force is created. This means

deciding surface/submarine: political control: distribn of costs.

Surface fleet of 200 missiles wd. cost $5-600 m. a year over 10 years.

U.S. 40%, G. 40%, Italy 15%, U.K. 5% is U.S. idea. Contribn might be in kind, including (in our case) some of orders for ships, and

warheads? If proposal goes ahead, we must take our share – tho‟ we

are not yet committed.

Ch.Exch. No addn commitment this year, unless absolutely minimal. It wd. be

additional to POLARIS.

P.M. Basic U.S. concern is revival of G. (S.U.‟s concern is the same).

Hence anxiety of State Dept. to bend G. to At. Allce. Defence Dept.

more lukewarn, since they know that para. 8 force might be at

expense of conventional forces.

We must keep all these plans in play until our own technical

agreement on POLARIS is tied up. Thereafter must reconsider tests

ban, on wh. public opinion will not wait indefinitely. If we cd.

achieve this, we might also achieve a non-dissemination agt.

also. If G. accepted that – entered into long after war, not as price

of defeat – she might keep it: and it wd. be better than the para. 8

force. Therefore F. Sec. must keep N.A.T.O. Council in play,

avoiding either committing us or discouraging U.S. If we reach

point when we must commit ourselves, try to bargain some release

from Brussels Treaty commitment. [Exit C‟wealth Secy.

M. Avn POLARIS agt already commits us to heavy expdre - £100 m. in

U.S.A. Para. 8 force wd. about double this. For total we cd. make our own POLARIS.

F.L.A. M. Def. (ill) v. concerned about addl Expre. May circulate memm.

P.M. Contribn of warheads might be possible. But avoid commitment yet.

[Exeunt F.L.A. &amp; M.Avn

5. United Nations: Financing of Peacekeeping Operations

C(63) 43.

F.Sec. France &amp; S.U. wd. reject L.Ch.‟s proposal: that wd. provoke crisis

now. Better to defer it to spring of ‟64, when S.U. will be seen to be

the obstacle and will be in danger of losing vote. Therefore play for

time by my device, wh. Fr. and S.U. might accept.

L.Ch. Ingenious, if we were starting afresh. But Assembly have accepted

ruling of Intl Court that expenses of approved operation are

compulsorily payable. Better to let Assembly agree limit to expdre.

and matters of (compulsory) appointment. When limit exhausted

Secy Gen. has to seek fresh mandate. This wd. keep cost of opn under

control; and provide for review if character of opn changes.

When it came to the crunch, F.Sec.‟s “voluntary” contribns wd. have

to be made compulsory – as Assembly have power to do.

[Enter M.H.L.G.

F.Sec. L.Ch. right on merits. But tactically inadvisable. U.S. dislike

voluntary contribns, since they foresee moral pressure: but they wd.

probably accept my compromise to contain Fr. &amp; S.U.

P.M. Our political problem is basically to keep Fr. &amp; S.U. in.

M.Edn Merit of L.Ch.‟s plan is possibility of review if character of opn

changes. ? Try this first: if it fails revert to F.O. plan.

Ch.Duchy. L.Ch.‟s scheme right: but politically impracticable in U.N.

F.Sec. ? Accept M./Edn‟s proposal: Fr. &amp; S.U. will reject it anyhow; we can

then put forward my proposal as possible altve.

P.M. Agree. (But it doesn‟t solve problem of Fr. &amp; S.U. default.)

[Exit F.Sec.

6. Incomes Policy: Doctors‟ and Dentists‟ Pay. C(63) 48.

Ch.Exch. As in memm. Not as bad as it looks, given system of excess at

beginning of triennium and deficiency at end. Therefore accept

(since rejection is impossible) subject to further considn of timing

and presentation.

P.M. Agree. Make a plan for presentation etc. (Ch.Exch., M/Health,

M.W.P.)

7. British Transport Commission: The Beeching Plan (oral).

First Secy Next Cab. to consider our draft statement.

Beeching plan v. drastic. We must accept it in principle, as part of

modernisation etc. But we must watch passenger closures; freight

proposals; redundancies – 90,000 in 3 years (less normal wastage

of ? 20,000 a year). Passenger closure can be left to consultve

machinery, subject to our taking “all other important factors” into

account and indicating special considn for e.g. some Scottish lines,

and for some suburban commuter services.

M.T. B. will announce to-day publicn on 27 March.

M.H. Area consultn machinery will be v. lengthy. ? Substitute (by amdt of

Act, if necy.) a more rapid &amp; comprehensive machine, wh. wd.

examine each area as a whole.

Ch.Exch. Avoid changing machinery if it appears we are doing so for our own

convenience.

Home Sec. Tackle closures in right order, beginning with most remote stations.

Ch.Duchy. We can‟t alter procedure. All depends on tone of first comment in

Parlt., press, T.V. etc. Emphasise modernisation: and fact that all

change hurts.

Ch.Secy. ? Increase number of consultve cttees.

M.H. Modernisation argt will lose its appeal quite quickly. Therefore

concentrate time span.

M.W.P. Build up bus services as altve – and a better altve. Important

presentationally.

P.M. Long time span eases problem of redundancies. But also increase

number of cttees.

L.Ch. Also cut down period of notice: keep cttees. in continuous session etc.

M.T. Period of notice is statutory.

Ch.Sec. And cttees. are voluntary people.

P.M. At least increase number of cttees: work in panels etc. Stress

altve Services.

M.T. Will consider.

M.H. If decisions are announced individually, endless P.Q.‟s, adjournment

debates etc.

? Announce them in groups, with convincing reasons wh. will attract

majority support.

M.T. Will consider this, too.

M.W.P. Enlist support from industry, commerce, taxpayer etc!

[Exit L.P.S., M.A.F.F.

8. Valuation for Rating. C.(63) 46.

M.H.L.G. If Oppn force debate, ? offer factual enquiry on lines proposed. This

wd. meet fear that burden may soon become intolerable.

Ch.Exch. Agree.

P.M. Two problems:- a) individual increases in valuation wh. are resented

(altho‟ salutary).

b) broaden issue of rates/taxes ratio &amp; trend of local

exprs.

Accept proposal it Ch. Exch. approves terms; Home Sec., M. Health,

Ch. Duchy, M.W.P. to help. Also S/S. Scot.

M.T. Method of giving Exch. grants to local auths dubious. We are

agreeing new arrangements for transport grants; don‟t imperil these.

Ch.Exch. Will consider.

M.Edn May be embarrassing to disclose our estimate of trend of expre on

educn. Don‟t leave ourselves no freedom of manoeuvre.

Ch.Exch. Will watch this: ? must accept parallel enquiry for Scot. Choice of

Chairman important; also timing of report. Will submit proposals

for next Cab.
