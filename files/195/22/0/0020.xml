C.C. (63) 20 28th March, 1963 10.p.m. H/C

1. Satellite Communications. C(63) 56.

[Enter Ch. Whip; M. Avn; S. of S. Air; P.M.G.; Parly Sec F.O. (Smithers)

Parly Sec.. As in memm; Statement to-morrow as foundation for subsequent

F.O approach to Europe to discuss practical basis of co-opn with U.S.A., C‟wealth wd. be kept informed. Purpose of confce. – solidarity with Europe as bargaining factor with U.S.A., Wd compel France to go with us. Independent Br. system not feasible: we shd. not encourage it unless intl system fails. Competn impracticable: co-opn v. valuable. Don‟t delay confce: this wd. enable U.S. to erode European posn. Rival system is not a threat. Nor are our facilities. Real bargaining power is European solidarity; U.S. can‟t proceed without Europe. If agreed, so inform France &amp; C‟wealth before to-morrow‟s debate.

M. Avn. Party v. anxious to go it alone. Impracticable. Must co-operate either with U.S. or Europe. Difficult to say which is better – one system or two competitive systems. To choose now is to weaken our bargaining power. Therefore say we are determined to go into space in terms of communications, satellites &amp; launchers But can‟t forecast what system. Therefore consider with our E.L.D.O. partners.

P.M.G. F.O. want commitment now to Intl system: M. Avn want commitment deferred.

Parly Sec. Intl system is our first objective – because it is what others want.

F.O.

M. Avn. Not necessarily the launchers. Intl system not v. different from intlly agreed competitive system.

P.M. Back a world agreed system: but consult partners on its detailed form and part to be played by individual participants. Don‟t exaggerate going it alone: merely say that we will take counsel with our E.L.D.O. friends.

Ch. Sec. V. expensive business: back one system rather than two.

[Exeunt M.Avn; S.of S. Air; P.M.G.

2. Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. (oral). [Enter Sir H. Caccia.

First Secy. 1) Do we endorse this morning‟s decision to concede secession to N. Rh.? Or do we break off talks.

2) Do we concede demand – to be made by Field to-morrow – for independence for S. Rh. as condition of attending confce.

I cd. not concede 2) forthwith: but wd concede it – with equal treatment for N.Rh. – in principle, in terms of revised statement. If we don‟t, projected confce will fail. Therefore I support it.

Field‟s motives complex: but he hopes to escape first from U.K., then from Fedn.

P.M. Grave political risks in giving present S. Rh. Govt independence. But if Fedn dissolved (as result of secession of N. Rh.) we face those risks anyhow. Or could we conceive of N. Rh. &amp; Ny. as independent - but not S.Rh.? Or shd. we send them all away without any commitment.

First Secy. Revised statement wd. probably get Field to confce. And he wants a loan (tho‟ he wd. turn to Union as an altve).

Com. Sec. He will come to confce. in the end – for sake of economic links with N.Rh. But promise of independence v. dangerous. Wd. precipitate crisis in C‟wealth and internationally.

L. Ch. I don‟t agree. Surgical operation now required. If N.Rh. secedes, S. Rh. will in fact become indept; and we can‟t deny it.

Ch. Duchy. C‟wealth Secy is right. Indepce for present Govt. unthinkable. “In normal way” can only mean, in modern practice, to majority – not to a minority. But if we reject it, Field will accept this, since he knows we can‟t concede it.

P.M. But problem will arise when Fedn is liquidated. Only question is whether we face it now or evade it – for not more than a year!.

First Secy. If latter, I can only say that issue of indepce does not arise yet, in relation to either S. or N. Rh. We are concerned only with future of Fedn.

Caccia. F. Sec. bound to advice that we shd. be questioned on “appropriate time &amp; conditions”. If this means under existing constn. we shd. have no support in U.N. apart from Portugal and Union. U.N. action wd. be limited unless there was disorder – when they cd. intervene.

M. Def. We have no effective power in S. Rh. to-day. Therefore we can‟t really object to shedding responsy without power.

L.P. But period of waiting for appropriate time wd. expose us to endless pressure from U.N.

Com. Sec. I couldn‟t accept it qua C‟wealth. We can‟t stop it: but we mustn‟t bless it.

P.B.T. Give them all independence – wh. is what U.N. wants.

M. Health. I agree with Ch. Duchy. Secession is one thing: indepce another. We shd. go ahead with confce.

M.W.P. ? Tell Field constl advance dependent on constn change.

First Secy. He hasn‟t the majority required for the purpose. And he is not disposed to change, except by broadening of African franchise.

Ch. Duchy. Only a constn wh. gave an African majority wd. justify indepce. If conceded in a year‟s time, it wd. be unacceptable to C‟wealth.

M. Lab. I agree. Confine ourselves to secession at this stage. Consider indepce for S.Rh. only when we consider it for N.Rh.

P.M. ? Omit secession for N. Rh. &amp; indepce for S. Rh. and say that since Fedn must clearly be wound up we shall call confce. to consider all resultant problems. Either that is done by agreement (without necessarily involving indpce for S. Rh. at that stage): or we put in a commission to do it.

First Secy That wd. precipitate premature crisis with Fedn Govt. Better to omit refce. to S. Rh. indepce, and rely on Field to come to confce. in fact.

But hard for Party to swallow.

M.H.L.G. Tell S. Rh. outright that we cannot concede indepce without majority?

L. Ch. Then they will never have indepce!

Com. Sec. Better that they shd. take it than that we shd. give it.

P.M. ? Then omit refce. to S. Rh. indepce. But S. Rh. may then refuse to attend confce. and we must liquidate the Fedn ourselves. But concentrate on that step first: leave indepce until Fedn has disappeared.

3. Chief Anthony Enahoro (oral)

Att. Gen. Soskice agrees Brown‟s original point faulty; but has found another reason for believing that, though doubtful, second count does on balance carry death penalty. I can‟t challenge Soskice with complete confidence.

N. Att. Gen. will not be quoted on interpretn of second count or (as member of N. Govt) to go any further than Abubakar as regards further charges.

E. is not at real risk: Soskice‟s point has not occurred to N. Lawyer!

L. Ch. Cd. not Att Gen visit N. Att. Gen and satisfy himself on this point. Legal construction of section involved v. complex: &amp; wd. exercise judicial Cttee. It cd. only come before them if death sentence was passed; and they wd. be unlikely to confirm such a sentence. Cd. not Att. Gen. discover whether E. is to be tried on same lines as Awolowo – i.e. by Judge without jury, wh. cannot inflict d.p.

First Secy. Politically impracticable. If Att. Gen. not satisfied, H/C won‟t be. We must refuse to return E.

P.M. Awkward to offend N. whose judicial standards are high. N. already wants to be a republic (but still to be member of C‟wealth). Deal with this favourably before rejecting request for E? Consider E. further: probably say that they have political difficulties – so do we! Cab. Monday.
