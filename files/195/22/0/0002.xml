C.C.(63)2. 3 January 1963. 5.p.m.

[Enter F.L.A. : S of S War : S of S Air; M/S. Col. Affairs

1. Bahamas Meeting : December 1962. (oral).

P.M. Reported result of discussions – with M. Def: F. Sec : Com &amp; Col. Sec. E.W. detente not much improved in my 6 yrs. as P.M. Soviet hold over satellites may be weaker; and Cuba shook Kv. Soviet attitude may therefore be more flexible : and new approach to detente may be possible. But W. alliance in some disarray, partly due to intransigence of Germany on Berlin, partly due to “immobilisme“ of French policy. U.S. therefore troubled. They are pledged in effect, to support with nuclear power any decision reached by France and Germany; they have to maintain large forces in Europe; and their economic position is insecure. President likely to react positively, by trying to break deadlock, rather than negativitely, by withdrawing from Europe.

This was background to Skybolt debate. A fallacy to suppose that U.S. abandoned Sky (despite pressures of U.S.A.F. and Douglas Corp) in order to prevent U.K. from acquiring 100 missiles. Decision technically justified by proved success of Polaris and Minuteman and proved unreliability of Sky.

The first offer was to maintain production of Sky on 50/50 cost sharing basis, with liberty to us to buy what we needed.

A foolish proposal for us : we shd. have had no control over devt. programmes. Therefore we rejected it.

Shd. we try to retain independent n.d. at all? France is trying to acquire one, but for reasons of prestige rather than from conviction of its efficacy. Cost and sophistication are increasing alarmingly; and effectiveness of mere warhead will depend more and more on associated decoy systems, guidance systems etc. Shd. we therefore drop out of this race? I reminded President of earlier history of T.A. : its devt. In U.S.A. during the war; our later exclusion from the Churchill/Roosevelt bargain; my own reopening of the issue with Prest. Eisenhower, which resulted in amdt. of Macmahon Act and renewal of U.S./U.K. partnership.

But this relates to the weapon : what is now relevant is the delivery system – and that system as it will be in 10 or 20 years time. Our own system will endure for another few years : thereafter, since we are in the game now, we had better remain in it.

U.S. morally bound by Sky agreement to help us to do so. Therefore, if we are to remain in game, we must have Polaris. It is suitable for a small island, whereas fixed site missiles are not (including Bomber airfields). And it prolongs our n.d. longer than Sky.

It was this last point which troubled U.S. Polaris was different in kind and character from Sky. Also they want to spread – not to concentrate - responsibility for n.d. President acutely aware of dilemma over Berlin : if Soviet attack it, he can only reply by nuclear power – at probable cost of destroying Europe. He does not want to be forced into this choice between surrender and holocaust by intransigence of his

European allies. He wants to settle the vital issues, particularly Berlin : and he resents obstruction of countries which have no responsibility for wielding ultimate power.

But this cd. not commit us to making over Polaris (if we got it) wholly to N.A.T.O. Their use is gravest national crisis must rest with H.M.G. and they must be served by men who are The Queen‟s officers. In other respects they can be “assigned” to N.A.T.O. or some multilateral assocn. This is proper relationship between concepts of independence and interdependence.

If we dropped out completely, result wd. be bad for U.S. : an alliance of free peoples cd. not be maintained on this basis. Moreover, if U.S. reverted to isolationism, we shd. be helpless before a Soviet threat or bluff. Finally, conventional armies are useless if they can be bluffed by a nuclear threat which we can‟t counter bluff.

Polaris meets these points for as far ahead as we can see and enables us to continue to make our own independent effort to promote the détente with Soviet Union wh. I still believe to be ultimately possible – and essential if mankind is not to destroy itself.

Current anti Americam sentiment in U.K. not unnatural. But – U.S. have not bilked us on Sky (properly regarded) : nor is it likely that they will bilk us on Polaris. And, if we are to retain an independent n.d. there was no practical alternative. Unrealistic to abandon n.d. : equally unrealistic to try to “go it alone” (like French) with n.d.

Hence my decision at Nassau : v. grateful for Cabinet‟s support.

M.Def. Strong body of opinion that we shd. not have an independent n.d., widely held view. Opposite view favours our building our own independent n.d. – also widely held. Our own compromise is in a pretty touchy position. But Polaris represents $800 m. worth of R. &amp; D. wh. we cd. not duplicate ourselves : and it prolongs our n.d. for as far ahead as we need look.

Probable criticisms: -

a) Will U.S. go back on bargain? Not realistic economically to try to reinsure against this risk by any form of independent R.&amp;D. But we shd. try to get some “ironmongery” here as soon as possible.

b) The gap. This must be committed, between 1965 and 1970. But we can‟t devise new weapon now to fill this gap. TSR2 will come in during this period; and we might stretch Blue Steel; and we might further develop electronic counter measures.

c) Effect on conventional forces. This we must certainly watch, in order not to let conventional forces be run down too much.

F.Sec. Can‟t ignore risk of being blackmailed by S. Union and not being supported by U.S. Nor cd. we accept posn. in which France (? and Germany) was only nuclear power in Europe.

We must make it clear that our right to use Polaris independently in defence of supreme national interests is valid in any circumstances.

Allocn. to N.A.T.O. or multilateral orgn is acceptable (subject to this proviso) and shd. help to dissuade Germany from developing an independent nuclear power of her own.

L.P. Congratulate P.M. and colleagues on agreement. We must be strong, independently, if we are to promote disarmament and détente.

Also, alliance with U.S.A. depends on our retaining independent power of our own.

I have always favoured Polaris – wh. gives us what W.S.C,. once described to me as “indestructible retaliation” i.e. on underwater second strike weapon.

M.Avn. Preliminary investigns. so far confirm that, if U.S. renege, we cd. develop ourselves more cheaply than we originally thought.

Ch.Exch. Must be prepared to meet powerful argument against credibility – to Soviet Union – of independent n.d. in second half of 60‟s.

Will S.U. really pay attention to us, if U.S.A. stand aside?

On expdre. we have already to face economies if defence‟s share of G.N.P. is to remain steady. If Polaris is to be additional, and first-charge, burden on our resources, problem of economics will be ever more acute.

S.&amp;S. Air. Watch technical wording of any written undertaking about “assignment”.

L.P.S. It will remain objective of U.S. Govt. to eliminate separate independent n.d.‟s, if possible. Hence importance of “European” n.d.

But France unco-operative : and Germany must be denied.

Therefore, though Europe has almost as great an industrial potential as U.S.A., little progress can be made. Cd. M/Def. and M.Avn. give us a detailed survey of possibilities in this respect, (assuming political obstacles overcome), with financial implicns.

F.Sec. If this assumes German share in production, this wd. split N.A.T.O.

Ch.Duchy. a) Agreement a great triumph. But we must not be drawn into defining supreme national interests. Must keep hands free.

b) We have always relied on U.K/U.S.A special relationship and tried to help U.S.A. Difficult to see any U.S. reciprocity since Kennedy Administration took office. This accounts for current anti-

Americanism in U.K. Kennedy‟s advisers are too arrogant and too “inflated” by Cuban success.

M.Lab. I agree. All the more important that credibility of our n.d. shd. be real and valid. We must be able to show that Polaris, when we get it, will be effective.

M.Health. If U.S. have Polaris already, why must we wait till 1969?

M.Def. Because of timetable of building submarines.

M.Edn. U.S. very “exalté” at present. More personal contacts are important, if U.K./U.S.A. relationship to be maintained.

P.M. Kennedy Administration consists of new men – v. clever but v. ignorant. But best of them are humble and anxious about use of power. If we followed de Gaulle technique and promoted an isolationist and nationalistic movement, it wd. be temporarily popular but unviable in longer term and bad for U.S.A.

F.Sec. They are arrogant; and impatient with Europe. But they are patient and skilful in dealing with S. Union.

Ch.Duchy. Is there a formal agreement, safeguarding our right to Polaris?

M.Def. Only the text in the communiqué signed by President and P.M.

P.M. We don‟t want a treaty : but we must get possession of some missiles on blueprints.

M.Def. I agree : if necessary, pay a deposit for this.

[Exeunt M.Def and 4 Service Ministers.

2. Foreign Affairs (oral).

Congo.

F.Sec. U.S.A. were prepared to back U.N. in military action to coerce Katanga, if necessary by deposing Tshombe. This action developed more rapidly than expected (though Katanga probably fired first shots).

We have objected:

a) because it goes beyond U.N.‟s functions.

b) “ capture of Elizabethville does not mean the end of Tshombe. It means guerrilla war and occupation.

I therefore advised T. to return from Salisbury, to accept Spaak‟s financial proposals and to give Adoula six months to produce constl. proposals. I also urged U. Thant to give him guarantees of personal safety.

Great confusion locally – Gardiner refusing to recognise T. Thant‟s

guarantees. T. may therefore refuse to return to E‟ville and take to the bush, particularly since U.N. Forces have taken J‟ville against T. Thant‟s orders.

[Re-enter M.Def.

If guerrilla war breaks out, what do we do? We ought not to involve ourselves any further in any attempt by U.N. to impose a political settlement. Therefore sit back for a few days and wait to see whether T. does return to E.‟ville. But soon we shall face the question whether we will contribute any more to U.N. campaign.

A resolution to Secy. Council wd. be amended and we shd. then have to veto it. Face this fence when we come to it.

Meanwhile avoid action wh. cd. be interpreted as preventing T. from negotiating with Adoula.

P.M. U. Munieri may soon change sides, in order to preserve their assets.

We shd. therefore remain impassive for the moment.

F.Sec. U.N. will need more money in March. We shall have to decide before then.

P.M. U.S. fear Soviet “invasion” if Adoula falls. But they are not trying to influence A. to carry out his share of bargain.

F.Sec. U.N. action a bad precedent for e.g. Somalis in N. Kenya.

L.P. But we must not either endorse this line or appear to frustrate them.

P.M. I agree. Tshombe has failed to use the time we bought him and has overplayed his hand. He will probably fall.
