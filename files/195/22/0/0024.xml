C.C. (63) 24 9 April 1963 11.30 a.m.

1. Radcliffe Report (oral). [Enter Ch.Whip.

P.M. Report received. Publication drill. Circulation after Easter, for personal inforn.

2. Federation of Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland (oral).

First Secy Revised draft as agreed by Cab.

Discussed sitn with Dupont; I will give him letter this evening.

S. Rh. Cab. will consider it to-morrow. Local opinion supports Field: Whitehead backs claim for indepce. If F. thinks our reply unsatisfy, he will summon Parlt after Easter. He now insists on full indepce Confce early in May before Confce on links with N. Rh. Also contemplating some unilateral action, if necy. Ir. concedes indepce in principle, subject to

i) prior dissoln of Fedn. This disposes of their claim to indepce within the Fedn.

ii) reservation about prior discussn of matters “which always arise” in this context.

ii) implies that links Confce should precede indepce Confce. S.Rh. may accept ii) and Lr may therefore keep them in play. Propose to publish letters on Thursday and this may hold posn over Easter.

We can‟t go further. But neither Field nor Welensky likely to accept it. Therefore mustn‟t make reply any more negative.

Com.Sec. Examine text v. carefully. Last 2 paras. confusing.

Play it as long as possible: but must make it clear that we can‟t concede indepce with present Constn. They realise that otherwise they wd. not get intl recogn; and they will therefore be willing to contemplate some liberalisation of Constn. This will not be as much as we should like: and we shall therefore have v. difficult decision to take. But to have indepce Confce in May before a links Confce is to put premium on S. Rh. obduracy and to prevent second confce from ever happening.

P.M. Must eliminate idea of indepce within Fedn – i.e. idea of legalising convention of non-interference in internal affairs: and confusion between this concept and real indepce. They have come some way to realising necy steps before genuine indepce: but still want this dealt with before links. Must therefore try to convince them that premature indepce, particularly if asserted, wd. involve them in Intl boycott, subject to doubtful help from Union. Therefore purpose of our reply must be to leave posn vague in order to elicit a further lr and thus keep matter open.

Com.Sec. “Preliminy discussions” too vague. It must be a conference (including all Parties in Legn).

P.M. But will they refuse a Confce of this kind, while accepting discussns?

Ch.Duchy. Recogn of convention if non-interference v. doubtful. Admit that we have not interfered in practice: but draw line at formalisation in legn, though discussions may be possible (i.e. last sentence of para. stands).

L.Ch. But we have publicly recognised convenn already: and we can‟t avoid recognising that it is binding on us. They want this recogn as an insurance against Labour Govt. But it might weaken their posn in this respect, since it is an invitn to Labour Party to repudiate convenn.

L.P. Omit this para. entirely? Earlier para. disposes of claim to indepce within the Fedn.

L.Ch. Alternatively, substitute new para. reciting and reaffirming existing convention and adding that can‟t do more until full indepce.

P.M. Yes. Though this concept is not mentioned in letter, it is in their minds: and we must indicate this, with our comment on it.

M.H. Preceding para. Last sentence gives impression all over bar shouting.

L.P.S. And that S. Rh. has only to secede to become indepnt.

P.M. Point made in para. 3 of p.1. Omit whole para.

L.P. But must retain thought of no automatic link between S. Rh. indepce and secession of N. Rh. or Ny.

M.Edn Insert “in any event” before “not be possible” in para. 3 on p.1.

L.Ch. Or omit last three lines of para. on p.2.

P.M. Agree.

But on measures before indepce, do we stipulate “discussions” or “Confce”.

M.H.L.G. Discussions don‟t point to agreement and assume indepce inevitable. Confce better.

Com.Secy Redraft of vital sentence. “After this, we wd. convene a Confce to discuss……”.

Or “At the appropriate time we would convene …….”.

Or “In any case H.M.G. wd. expect to continue …….”.

P.B.T. Is para. 3 an invitation to secede?

First Secy But F. is too scared of W. to do it.

M.H. Top of p.2. Second half of first sentence illogical. By that date there will be no Fedn for S. Rh. to be a member of!

L.Ch. But refce. to constl posn valuable.

First Secy Publicn after delivery of reply?

P.M. Yes. Emphasise confidl nature of letter pending consultn with F. about timing of publicn of both lrs.
