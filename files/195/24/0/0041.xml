C.C.(64)13 3 December 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P. As in statement.

2. Oversea Affairs. (oral)

a) Congo

F.S. Slight improvement. Govt. columns not occupying territory but rescued 140 yesterday and may save more. But no certainty about others.

Spaak agreed yesterday on political initiative – repves. of U.N. &amp; OAU shd. be sent to organise localised cease fires, leading to later conciliation.

Tshombe unpopular but indispensable: must therefore try to persuade him to abandon conquest of rebel province and to govern by consent. Avoid involvement.

b) Europe

F.S. Spaak confirmed dominance of de G. France cool about Congo – because U.S. involved. S. backs our W‟ton plans broadly.

c) Sudan

F.S. New Govt. v. troublesome about o‟flying rights. We shall slow down aid and try to mobilise pressure, particularly via India – wh. we can‟t easily reach without o‟flying Sudan.

3. Burma: War Damage Claims. C.(64)23

[Enter Ch. Secy. : Ld. Adv. : Att Gen.

Ch. Sec. As in memm. Note that in connection with recent take-over bid, Co did not list compensn. in assets: and present shareholders not as at the time.

M/S.CRO Beware of precedent for natd. Br. assets elsewhere.

F.S. Not a precedent for natn.. But I support proposal.

L.Ch. But v. strong action: retrospective denial of rights objectionable. For this reason, &amp; for others, defer legn. till next Session – unless (as improbable) action date fixed for July. Not unfair to Co., if warned now that they are regarded by us in same was as by Consve. Govt.

A.G. Action now likely to be set down for May. Therefore must legislate now – for reasons in para 13.

L.Adv. Will prob. be heard between May and July. Cdn‟t justify delay (now that point of law settled) as soon as plaintiffs ready. Therefore legislate now.

Ch.Duchy. I agree. If estop claims, shd. do so promptly.

H.S. And other claims in para 3?

L.P. If so, will delay: place reserved in programme for this Bill but not anything wider.

P.M. Proceed as proposed. [Exeunt Ch. Secy. : Att. Gen; Ld. Adv.

4. 700th Anniversary of Parliament. C.(64)24.

[Enter Com. Sec : Exit M/S. C.R.O.

[Enter M.P.B.W.

L.P. As in memm. Speaker‟s cttee. to organise June celebrations, wh. shd. involve nation-wide pageantry.

For Jan, influence schools (no power to direct) to participate.

P.M. June might coincide with C‟wealth P.M.s confce., if we have one.

If Hansard Socy. co-opted, consider whether we can give them more money for this special effort.

Ch.Duchy. I support this.

C.Sec. I shall soon propose C‟wealth consultative assembly: this, tho‟ wd. meet later than June, might somehow be linked.

?And associate C‟w. H. Crs. with Jan, as well as June, celebrations.

If a film of next C‟w P.M.‟s confce., also a film of celebrations.

P.M. Expand Jan. somehow: ?C‟wealth Speakers to parade (as when new Chamber opened). Helpful opportunity for Speakers‟ confce., in any event. L.P. shd. consult Mr. Speaker on this.

S/S.W. Don‟t forget C.P.A.

P.M. No: but may be overtaken by new Consultve. Assembly.

M.P.B.W. Jan a domestic occasion: no case for C‟w or overseas participation.

S. de M. only a domestic milestone: M. Charta [sic] a major intl. occasion.

Therefore leave Jan. as is: but hasten preparations, and publicity in schools etc.

P.M. No: S. de M. not all that small. Proceed as proposed.
