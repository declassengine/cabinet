C.M.(64)31 11 June 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

2. Typhoid in Aberdeen. (oral)

L.P.S. May have to withdraw other tins of other meat. M/H. (absent) is considering.

M.A.F.F. A slippery slope: and it is the trade, not the Govt. which imports.

M.P. ?Re-sterilise by radioactivity.

L.P.S. Will report further after discussn. with M.H.

Ch.Duchy. Beware of being stampeded into ridiculous measures.

M.A.F.F. Deficiencies of Arg. factory involved has now installed precautions. But about 15 months past supplies potentially at risk.

?Retailers may seek compensn. from Govt. Shd. we seek redress from Argn. Govt. who allowed this certificate to be affixed to untreated tins.

Govt. who allowed this certificate to be affixed to untreated tins.

3. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Laos

M.W.P.(C) Prospects for Polish type confce. uncertain.

b) Arms for Spain.

May be prejudiced by Ch. Pincher‟s revelations in D. Express.

V. damaging. May be finally ditched if Lab. Party openly oppose. If so, some electoral advantage in blaming them for empt. results. Must consider some estimate of this - ?for publicn. if we do lose the deal. And further damage since wd. have meant return by Spain to U.K. arms supplies.

c) Cyprus.

C.S. No offer by Ball to use 6th Fleet. But will try to find out.

d) Indonesia

S/S.D. Must continue to back Summit. But S. may try to use it to instal more insurgents – as during Kennedy “cease fire”. Therefore try to keep to min. period during wh. S. may be active and we shall be inhibited.

And remember some awkward decisions if Summit fails, since can‟t stay on defensive indefinitely.

M.W.P.(C) Agree. S. will try to build up confrontn. behind series of successive

and inconclusive Summits. But this one may at least restore Filipino and Malaysian relations.

C.S. I will renew warnings to Sukarno.

4. UNCTAD. (oral) [Enter S/S.I. from Geneva

S/S.I. Just returned from Geneva, where confce. is ending. Devd. countries have underrated its political significance – especially to us on N-S issue.

They also underrated capacity of undev. countries to hold together if West was inactive. The 75 are now an organised and powerful bloc, including some C‟w. countries (N.Zealand!).

Also badly prepared: and Secretariat (from undev. countries) biased on commodity policy from outset.

Also U.S. too offhand.

We took a more positive line and secured leadership of confce.

But U.S. have got worse and annoyed everybody. C‟w. v. incensed against U.S., who have thrown away all they have done by aid etc.

Unfruitful work in cttees. led 75, with Soviet support, to steamroller their own resolns., wh. are unacceptable to us. Done not only by extremists, but also by moderates.

Conciliation procedures then adopted: S.U. excluded and their attitude to result unknown.

As a result, commodity and access papers covered by a “chapeau” wh. we can prob. accept. If chapeau removed, we can accept access proposals (but French can‟t). On commodities, U.S. will reject – wh. is what we want.

On prefs, weak paper but acceptable. Dilton on access.

On supply. financing, o.k.

On institutions, we can accept continuing institns. in principle – but not the 75 (steamrollered) resn. wh. wd. create a new I.T.O. Some compromise therefore essential: otherwise 75 will be voted in plenary, referred to Gen. Assy. and accepted by U.N. Instn. will then be created.

May therefore settle on continuation of confce. at intervals of not more than 3 years: a Board of 52 members (17 for developed) with voting powers; Bd. will report thro‟ ECOSOC, wh. can comment but not veto; provision for no duplicn. with other instns. So far so good. But sub cttees of Board? We oppose: but U.S. will accept. On voting, we deprecate special procedures, since bodies only advisory and shd. not appear to be mandatory. But U.S. want ⅔ majority in both confce. and Board, with ⅔ maj. of devs. and ⅔ maj. of undevs. Not a real safeguard. Sec. Gen. therefore proposes no voting if no consensus of opinion – but refce. to conciliation machinery and, if this fails, voting shd. be adopted but only on advisory basis. This proposal still uncertain and S.G. will create cttee. to consider all proposals. This puts it back to U.N. wh. suits us. U.S. will accept this: Fr. attitude hostile (?) to any special voting procedure but may accept conciln. machinery. We shd. support.

On principles must either accept some and reject others or, preferably,

refer for further considn.

On Final Act, economic preamble v. arguable: we may have to reserve our posn., but must try to sign.

Ch.Exch. Can‟t accept permanent maintenance of value of commodities. If chapeau commits us to no more than considn. of land, this, coupled with safeguards about consumers etc. – shd. suffice. Must also reserve our posn. specifically on commodity commissions.

M.A.F.F. Have lost our chance to maintain that we pay for food imports what they are worth, not what undevs need for devt. Individual papers on commodities and access are unacceptable from this point of view; how valid is chapeau as safeguard?

S/S.I. Access paper is acceptable!

M.A.F.F. Maybe. But policy is still objectionable: and will chapeau suffice to protect us, particularly if subsequent stages are to be in hands of a new instn. with voting powers. Non-mandatory character, when at U.N. stage, not proof against moral and political pressure for intl. commy. agts. wh. will develop. If to resist slippery slope. shd. do so now.

C.S. Outcome good qua C‟w. relations. But objectionable for us, qua hidden subsidy involved and qua revival of colonial/anti colonial split just when we are ending it in political sphere.

S/S.I. M.A.F.F. is taking v. extreme view – see the specific let out for excepl. circs. in relation to primary products (incl. cereals and meat).

Ch.Exch. I agree that our bargaining posn. in particular commodities will not be weakened. We shd. do ourselves more harm if we let confce. break down.

L.Ch. I am not sure. Can pay too high a price for compromise settlement.

M.W.P.(C) But breakdown dangerous: won‟t affect attitude of undevs and will increase N.S. tension.

M.Lab. I support Ch. Exch. It will be passed by U.N. anyhow – and we shall then get odium instead of political advantage wh. we shd. get as undevs best customers.

P.M. Unwise to formalise unity of 75 by an institn.

M.A.F.F. It is this wh. puts us on a collision course, from wh. we shall have to retreat at some stage.

M/S.E.S. I support Ch. Exch.

Ch.Duchy. So do I – otherwise we may lose chapeau.

P.M. Might swallow ordinary U.N. pressure. But Board more dubious, especially on proposed basis of voting.

[Enter M.H.

S/S.I. 17 seats out of 52 is favourable to us. Can‟t justify any more.

P.M. But need it have special voting procedure?

S/S.I. U.S. hope it wd. be a safeguard against future steamrollering

GATT, being contractual body, shd. not be affected. The undev pressure will continue just the same.

M.P. Better to be, with chance to control, than out.

C.S. No real option.

S/S.I. If accept, we accept only instn. not special voting procedure.

And we must maintain ascendancy over undevs. wh. our Delegation have established.

P.M. Must endorse S/S.I.‟s proposals but voting (wh. makes us constantly oppose unders) bad.

L.P.S. And present positively – as contribn. to closing of N.S. gap.

S/S.I. But decision on special voting procedures it to be subject of Sec. Gen.‟s cttee.: no decision on this (as distinct from instn.) now.

[Exit S/S.I.

P.M. On this basis go ahead.

2. Typhoid in Aberdeen. (Oral: resumed)

M.H. 6lb cans from two estabs. in Arg. and Ur. withdrawn, in light of suspicion that one of these was cause of Ab‟n. outbreak. (Ur. no direct connection with Ab.).

Yesterday learned Sainsbury considered that all products from Arg. estabt. if treated with unchl. water, shd. be withdrawn from their shops.

My of Health dispute need for this as regards small tins of corned beef; since only 6lb tins likely to be vulnerable. But 6lb cans of other meat shd. be withdrawn. Importers v. restive ab out this, in light of damage to trade. But decision unavoidable: and trade will co-operate if necy. (We have no powers to do this in absence of proof, wh. is not yet available). But Arg. estabt. will try to insist on unchld. products of Ur. estabt. also being withdrawn. No logical reason for this: and damage to trade might be even greater.

L.P.S. ?Small tins. There was one (non typh) bacillus in a tin in Hull.

M.A.F.F. Than a t. bacillus cd. have got in.

Govt. stamp merely means hygienic condns. - not specifically chlrtd. But that is implied.

M.H. Vegetables in tins probably o.k.

No reason for withdrawing any small tins. And avoid any public refce.

Difficult enough to explain why only now have we discovered meat other than c‟d. beef involved. Quantities are smaller.

Radioactive sterilisn: wd. frighten people.

Advice to public to cook all tinned meat impracticable.

Announce withdrawal during debate today? Arguable: altve. is special statement, since precedent set by original announcement by S/S.S. But may spoil debate - on hospitals.

P.M. If raised by Oppn., deal with it then. Otherwise, statement tomorrow.

Uruguayan meat (other than c.b.) in 6lb tins?

M.H. C.M.O. advises against withdrawal, altho‟ illogical. And v. damaging qua M.A.F.F. stocks.

L.P. But politically indefensible.

P.M. I agree. Persuade trade to withdraw. But emphasise only being withdrawn to be held pending clearance.

[Exit Ch. Exch. : MAFF

5. Offer of an Art Collection. C.P.(64)115

Ch.Sec. As in memm. Proposal as in para 4. We may not succeed – other bidders in market.

Disadvantages: a separate instn. (but Tate will accept): complications about suitable site; not cheap. But outweighed by advantages – and avoid odium of not trying.

L.Ch. Outdoor display will be v. controversial. Richmond Park wd. be better as requiring effort of special journey.

Cost: eg. Govt‟s contribn. to Leonardo.

Ch.Sec. Not committed to Regent‟s Park. Other possibilities cd. be explored.

Our Leonardo contribn. was largest that Govt. have ever made. And on financial grounds, collection is valued at $20-30m. A good investment.

M.P.B.W. Must try. Legn. will be required. And conditions may be troublesome.

S/S.S. Am negotiating for Pollock House collection (at £2m. and large estate). If we fail, may be more difficult to justify this.

M/S.E.S. Must try – for cultural reasons.

P.M. Agree.
