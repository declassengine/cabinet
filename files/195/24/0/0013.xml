C.M.(64)33 25 June 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

Osborne M.P. – 10 minute Bill to prohibit (coloured?) immigration. Decided to abstain or vote against: &amp; use chance to indicate what wd. have happened if we had not legislated. (No in pipeline.)

Vestures of Ministers Bill: agreed privately with Arch.Cant to postpone till next Session (tho‟ no announcement before Assembly). This will do qua H/C.: but Bp. Chester may protest by Motion, in Lords – wh. wd. force us to declare our hands earlier than convenient. If so, must accept this sitn.

P.M. Must we proceed with designation of Stevenage New Town? Anathema to Hertfordshire M.P.‟s.

M.H.L.G. Desirable on housing grounds: but will reconsider.

M.T. L.Transport fares must soon go up (also railways within 80 miles from London) to pay for wages settlement: (tho‟ compensating advantages in greater efficiency etc.) 7% increase in commuters‟ fares v. serious politically.

Ch.Exch. Bus settlement defensible: extension to railways indefensible – no economic basis &amp; no direct relation to wage claim (tho‟ one outstanding).

Sensible to announce bus settlement tomorrow (w.e. from 19/7). But railways consequential &amp; nonsense.

P.M. M/T. to consult Beeching forthwith: and check what, if anything, we can do.

[Exit M.T.

S/S.D. Lamp-posts in B‟cage Walk - and then Constn. Hill.

M.P.B.W. Announced in ‟62, without protest. Justified by safety. Contract let for B‟cage W. But will reconsider where contract not let – e.g. Constn. Hill.? instal electric light in existing standards.

M.P. Elecy. price increases in Y‟shire &amp; Midlands: new pylon in Sussex. All pre-election horrors, wh. E.P.C. must consider.

L.P.S. Get Parly. statements done as early as possible: don‟t bunch at end.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Cyprus

F.S. General agt. we shd. continue to contribute to U.N. force, at 1100.

C.S. Since Makarios accepts, must agree.

L.Ch. Posn. of missing U.K. officer &amp; driver?

S/S.D. Probably dead. But consider whether reward shd. be offered (via U.N.) for information leading to recovery.

P.M. Get reward settled quickly. We, rather than U.N., shd. offer.

F.S. Now agreed that directive to U.N. will be interpreted rigorously &amp; positively. Doubt whether need announce in H/C.

C.S. Unavoidable: P.M.P.Q. today:. Confirm direct with C. Govt. that M. does agree. Too risky, if he rejects.

P.M. Better to rest on U.T.‟s assurances.

M.W.P.(C) Despite attitude of C. Press, wh. Mak, controls?

P.M. Must make represns. to M. about this. And ask for assurance of better treatment for our forces.: Not from Mak! Make statement today.

b) Laos

F.S. Agt. with Poles to summon new sort of confce.

On Cyprus, Inonu has accepted talks at Fort David (under Dean Acheson); and hope Greeks will send repve. U.S. will try to work back through these talks to U.N.

c) Malta

C.S. Negotns. nearing end. Must change electoral law qua Church: and shall have Vatican‟s support.

Defence &amp; financial arrangements going forward – amounts unspecified. If break, shd. be on church issues. If succeed, introduce Bill next week.

S/S.D. Cab. must examine it v. carefully first.

L.P.S. Do we really want to give M. indepce.?

C.S. Only altve. is collapse of &amp; and re-emergence of Mintoff, in charge of a Malta politically united against us.

d) Laos etc

F.S. U.S. have promised to inform us before any action taken in Laos on N.V-N.

3. The Concord. C.P.(63)123&amp;124 [Enter M. Avn.

M.Avn. As in memm. Total addm cost £100m. (of which £50m. for us); result

of re-estmn. (wages, prices etc) and of increase in wing span &amp; weight.

U.S. still hesitating: but will probably go ahead with M.3. aircraft for five years later than ours. Operating economics, inc. with B.707, rather better.

On £5m, we get ⅓ of money back.

“ £5½m. “ “ ½ “ “ “

“ £6¼m. “ “ whole “ “

Stick to £5m. at present. Fr. agree.

Ch.Exch. Financial lunacy, especially given restrictions due to bang.

And many technical problems unresolved. If a clean slate, shdn‟t start it. Since committed, realise may be a major scandal.

Not that, if a success, will shorten life of V.C.10‟s &amp; therefore aggravate B.O.A.C.‟s financial difficulties. Ideally wiser to let subsonics have full last run, &amp; defer s‟sonic till Mach 3 stage.

Need indept. financial assessment of implicns: £5m. selling price unrealistic. More work needed on sonic bang: otherwise a ridiculous limitation.

M.Av n. Bang not as serious as you think.

L.Ch. Finance more serious. Better objects for expdre. than this. ? Pull out.

M.P.B.W. No! Vital technologically to keep in this business; otherwise exports will suffer.

Ch.Exch. But be sure we are in right technl stream!. It may be the U.S. one.

S/S.D. We were right to go for Mach 2 rather than 3: latter entails too many unknown technical factors. And we are bearing only half the costs.

We can‟t possibly pull out or drag our feet on first big intl. technl. project wh. we have seriously undertaken.

S/S.E.S. I agree – even tho‟ we may burn our fingers.

S/S.I. But what are economics of opn.? The post war successes (Viscount Caravelle &amp; big U.S. jets) have all been justified in terms of opng? costs.

M.Avn. At outset, C. will be 25-30% dearer than B.707. But flies twice as fast &amp; therefore twice as often. If achieves increase in load factor (70 pass. as distinct from 87 in B.707), will break even. 15% surcharge on ticket, wd. break even with same load factor as B.707. And, later on, economies will improve.

Ch.Exch. But selling price? And since B.707 is in opl. and C. is not, gap more likely to widen than to narrow.

M.A.F.F. Must have a saleable proposn. See para 4: this means a bigger sum than £40m. Must go ahead: but we need a realistic study of

economics, if expre. rises still further.

M.P. Better to devote all this effort to M.3 aircraft.

S/S.Ed. No: we chose &amp; must stick to it.

Ch.Exch. At least, avoid announcement – on top of pending cancellation charges for V.C.10. Otherwise we shall appear intolerably profligate.

F.S. And review project with Fr. Govt.

S/S.D. We can‟t drag our feet.

M.Avn. And can always review again - in Spring.

Ch.Sec. But let there be an indept. enquiry in meantime.

M.Avn. Would become known at once! Remember Corbett!

P.M. Must go ahead: with min. publicy. after M. Avn.‟s visit to Paris.

L.Ch. But Whitehall examn. of companies, own estimates of opg 7 costs desirable.

P.M. Not till after election. As I said.

F.S. Fr. might agree to broaden on W.E.U. basis,. (We are being slap- happy about this).

S/S.D. Wd. increase cost and delay operation. No!

Ch.Exch. Reserve right to reopen after election!

[Exit F.S. : C.S. : M. Avn.

4. London Transport (resumed) [Re-enter M.T.

M.T. Will see Beeching after lunch, with M.W.P.(D).

Wages Cttee. approved L.T. increase: announce today new types of bus etc. &amp; tomorrow increase in fares.

Br. R. will a) announce some increases in London area – based on last wages award (wh. have delayed to maintain paralleliss). w.e. 19/7.

Open to appeal to Tribunal in Oct.

b) Announce 7½% increase in 30/40 mile area in periphery, wh. will increase revenue, without losing custom (as elsewhere) and does not require refce. to Tribunal. Difficult to alter this. Also w.e. 19/7.

Law Officers reject direction to stop a particular rise: if so, (check) I have no power.

M.L. B. denied, at time, that last wage increase wd. require fare increase.

Ch.Exch. And if now justified on commercial grounds, why exactly same degree

of increase as buses.

M.T. In order to preserve bus/train fares ratio.

L.Ch. That is barefaced monopoly.

Ch.Sec. Adopt slower procedure – no increase until after Tribunal: and even tho‟ covers only London fares, cdn‟t increase outer fares independently.

P.M. Yes – if defers till after Elecn. But ? improper influence (since we deliberately gave B. powers to increase first and go to Tribunal afterwards, on grounds of speed).

Ch.Exch. No. Fares reaching out to Kettering can‟t be related to buses. It is link which is questionable.

M/S.Edn. Beware of overriding B.‟s commercial judgment – and of frustrating powers of quick decision wh. we gave him.

[Re-enter F.S.

M.T. I agree. Wrong managerially: and v. awkward administratively at this stage. We have always regretted this kind of intervention in the past.

P.M. I half - agree.

S/S.E.S. I too.

H.S. We can‟t stop B. But we can ask him to improve presentn., to avoid appearance of exploiting commuter.

S/S.D. But that simply means charging what traffic will bear.

Ch.Exch. But bus fares are offset by better services. Not so with trains.

If commercial case for train fare increases, why now rather than after last wage increase.

M.H. We are vulnerable on commuter fares, when we are trying to persuade people to live outside London.

P.M. Can we justify intervention (by request for longer procedure), wh. will become known?

Ch.Sec. On grounds that automatic link with buses is important issue of principle, on which Govt. ought to intervene.

M.L. And may be used as a means of delaying wage claim outstanding – i.e. regarded as such.

Ch.Exch Can‟t ask B. to hold up increase. But he must present it more defensibly.

P.M. Let M.T. talk to Beeching, but not use big stick. Short notice intolerable. Therefore try to impress Beeching with public relations aspect &amp; see how far he will go. M.W.P.(D) to be present.
