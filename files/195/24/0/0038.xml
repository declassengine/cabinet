C.C.(64)10 24 November 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Pensions. C.(64)18&amp;19 [Enter Ch. Whip : M.P.N.I. : P.M.G.

P.M. Use of computers?

M.Techy. Not really appropriate: max. saving of 3 weeks in normal conditions.

7/8 weeks if absolutely emergency measure. Over-stamping therefore preferable.

M.P.N.I. a) Retirement pensioners: 3 double payments = at least £60m. New contribns. possible from beginning of Feb. and would yield £40 m., leaving £10½ m. to be paid by Tsy. and £9½ m. from N.I. Fund. This wd. backdate pensions to Dec. &amp; wd. enable first payment to be made before Christmas. But new postage rates wd. have to be delayed a month = loss of £4½m.

b) N. Assistance. Above implies redn. in N.A. payments to those N.I. beneficiaries who are on N.A. This means £2m. instead of £6m. already approved: but extra £4 m. absorbed by increase in N.A. rates in Jan. Otherwise this costs another £10m. = £16½m. in all.

c) Widows. See App. A. to C. (64)18. All widows = £2.8m. per week. i.e. £8.6m. from Exch.

In all, cost to Exch. is £10½m. + £2m. for war + £1m. for widows = £15½m.

Ch.Exch. All addnl. to £18m. already conceded. Wd. increase inflationary pressure wh. Budget was designed to offset. I recommend against it.

M.O.D. And anomalies wd. be indefensible. £4 N.A. Christmas box has already caused great resentment among non N.A. pensioners. Therefore confine ourselves to limited advancement by 3 weeks or so, as M. Techy. proposes.

P.B.T. I support Ch. Exch. Mustn‟t arouse foreign doubts of stability again.

M.Techy. Cd. be done in 11 weeks or so. But doesn‟t solve financial problem: nothing will produce payment before Xmas and therefore, if financial risk can‟t be taken, no point in doing anything.

Ch.Duchy. Avoid an admve. shambles. We intended to introduce income guarantee at the outset, accompanied by modest rise in N.I. benefits. But this wd have been in April at earliest. This now impossible; and we have been compelled to act on N.I. alone - with result that we are at higher permanent level of N.I. benefits. To establish this is more important than retrospection – especially when added to other social changes already announced.

1¼ m. of N.I. beneficiaries are on N.A. &amp; can be helped in Jan. if we wish. 1¼ m. of them are above I. Tax exemption limit: is I.T. to be

adjusted accordingly (£12m. at stake in a full year)?

Therefore concentrate on N.A. increase: no case for doing more.

M.H.L.G. Better to start everything in March – including M.P.s‟ pay, if we had foreseen. Be careful about N.A. increase: Allen report shows 800.000 entitled to N.A. but not drawing it. Therefore start everything together in March.

M.O.D But can we risk disclosure that N.A.B. are pressing for increase in Jan?

Better to keep N.I. &amp; N.A. scales in step &amp; try to make limited advance on basis recommended by M. Tech.

M.P.N.I. I thought Cab. wanted me to make substantial advance! Why cdn‟t Ch. Duchy‟s case have been made earlier? We cd. do it more quickly than M. Techy. proposes: and N.A.B. pressure for increase will become known.

Therefore either we shd. do it quickly or accept financial objection to doing it at all.

Anomalies will not be created: £60m. for N.I. beneficiaries and £7.6 m. for others avoid this. Exch. must find 10½ m. for pensioners, £2m. war pensioners and £1 m. if across N.A. board = £13½m. Fund provides balance of £17½m.

P.M. Don‟t fear Oppn. criticisms: they had prepared nothing before 15 Oct. Here again we have inherited an inelastic system and no preparations for an increase. Also they voted against means of payment – income tax and petrol tax.

By contrast, our decision is generous: and we can‟t be represented otherwise.

In light of serious ec. devts. since last Cab. – and greater importance wh. we must attach to foreign opinion about cost of our social policies – we must be careful and must be seen to adhere to decisions taken.

Therefore stick to 29 March &amp; defend on grounds of technical difficulties, wh. even computerisation won‟t resolve.

M.P.N.I. I have resolved them: objection is now a financial one. It is not for me to defend it.

P.M. Still make point that computers won‟t help. But concede financial point – i.e. cost too high – as well. If necy., Ch. Exch. can be with M.P.N.I. at Party meeting.

First Secy. Difficulties not really resolved – except at risk of serious anomalies.

P.M. Yes: defend on grounds that:-

a) computers wd. not. make much difference &amp; wd. involve other risks

b) other types of altvs., tho‟ possible, wd. create new anomalies

c) economic detern. is powerful new adverse argument.

Ch. Duchy &amp; Ch. Exch. to defend thus.

M.P.N.I. There wdn‟t be serious anomalies.

P.M. Nevertheless, as I said: and no advance in N.A. date.

[Exeunt M.P.N.I. : P.M.G.

2. Economic Situation. (oral)

P.M. Rapid deteriorn in £ last week compelled drastic action on Monday morning. Impossible to convene Cab. in time. I therefore consulted all Cab. members at Chequers; and they agreed. Action designed to meet external threat: not a credit squeeze.

Ch.Exch. Swap facilities constructed in summer used as to ⅓ by election: and as to further ⅓ by end of week before last. Monday 16 Nov. was bad; arrested by P.M.‟s Guildhall speech on 17 Nov.: but Fri. 20 v. bad indeed.

Little left in swap arrangements: and cd. not draw on I.M.F. standby without first having to repay European swap. Hence increase in B.R. Salutary effect: but selling still going on and reserves insufficient to withstand steady attack prompted by lack of confidence in our economic policies. Attack is designed to secure deflation: but we don‟t believe it is necessary. Hence need to talk with one voice abroad &amp; another at home. If can hold posn. until import charges work, imports will decline; (whether we can then start to reduce them is another question). Budget &amp; B. Rate will increase deflation. Yet foreign critics still not satisfied.

First Secy. T.U.C. more difficult on incomes &amp; prices yesterday than hitherto, because they sense deflation.

M.H.L.G. Effect on bldg. socy. rates? Must distinguish our long-term policy on bldg. socs. from short-term difficulties.

P.M. Yes: but keep our heads down until we know if 2% increase is going to suffice. And socs. themselves will need time to consider.

Ch.Exch. Effect on P.W.L.B. rate so far is merely ⅛ of 1%: relatively immaterial. But wholesale two tier system ruinous to Exch. And on P.W.L.B. better to wait until April and then, if necy., increase general grant.

M.Techy. And emphasise, by practical steps, what techy. can contribute to industrial revival.

M.H.L.G. Make clear that neither P.W.L.B. nor bldg. socs. rates are suitable for 2-tier principle in short-term. Legn. needed to effect it – as we intend

to – in longer term.

Ch.Exch. Say nothing now about P.W.L.B.: and defer decision until we see how 7% B.R. works.

3. European Free Trade Association. (oral)

F.S. P.B.T. and I had a rough time in Geneva. Shock has affected basic public opinion – not merely Govtl. policies; and has shaken growing self-confidence of EFTA. Our defence made little impact on strong emotional feeling.

Risk of Art. 31 – which leads in to retaliation – being invoked was real, particularly among Swiss. And internal political stresses in Denmark are generating pressure for move from EFTA to EEC.

EFTA vital for our foreign-policy and for Europe. Its disintegration wd. wreck our chances of getting into EEC. Both orgns. are needed – even more so if we don‟t want to get into EEC.

Our price was formally cheap – undertaking to begin redn. &amp; aboln. in a matter of months. In practice much less time: next meeting in Feby. (in London?). If no redn. possible – or promissable – by then, we shall be in grave difficulties; if not promissable at all, EFTA might completely break up. (Any redn. wd. be for all, not EFTA alone). Whole episode illustrates importance of sound economy for foreign policy.

P.B.T. I always opposed surcharges and preferred quotas. Results even worse than I foresaw!

Retaliation wd. have been disastrous. We had to avert it – hence our formula, wh. only just averted it! But if their fears for impact on their exports are well founded, we ought to see some improvement in trade figures by mid Feb. But by then we must be able to promise some redn. by mid June: otherwise EFTA will break up.

First Secy. Whatever we did wd. have hurt EFTA exports. We took right action: and we must put our own economy above EFTA economies.

We shall not be able to start redns. by Feby. or even to promise them by June (as distinct from removing anomalies). If we encourage this expectation, imports will merely be postponed and flood will resume as soon as we reduce.

P.M. This may be right. But we can only safely remove it by first testing market by progressive reductions, keeping machinery intact &amp; available meanwhile. But if it has to become semi-permanent, must probably move to quotas.

M.A.F.F. EFTA v. important. F.S. and P.B.T. fought v. hard to save it.

Ch.Exch. Even so, Feby. v. early to commit ourselves to some redn.

F.S. At right moment – not yet – consider other means of holding EFTA together – meetings of Foreign Ministers etc.

Be v. careful about “semi – permanency”: equivalent to increase in tariffs or even devaln., and therefore implies that we may be able to remove charges (if we can‟t face deferred imports) only by first devaluing. Therefore we must appear to begin to reduce reasonably early.

P.M. Let it run a bit!

4. Buccaneer Aircraft. (oral) [Enter M. Avn.

P.M. Decision deferred &amp; reconsidered at Chequers. No other o‟sea market; and now established no requirement for our own defence programme – at least in immediate future. Therefore proposed to allow existing contract for 16 to be completed (with spares etc); but no further contract. Complete cancellation v. expensive and wd. create redundancy problems.

S‟ton – not so v. valuable: but altves. must be examined &amp; this may be costly. Flying rights (= contact with H.Cms. territories) more important, especially since not based on formal agreement.

Black African opinion probably expecting this decision (but not all 32); also U.N. opinion.

S/S.D. On this basis, empt. assured until 1968: &amp; further defence order, if approved, will prolong still further. Buccs. v. unsuitable (and extravagant) for internal repression.

P.M. F.S. to inform S.A. Govt.: I will announce tomorrow.

F.S. S.A. may not accept. They may want uniform, not composite, force of 32. If so, they might have to forego the £11m. already paid.

Spares decision right: but will raise issue of spares for naval items, on wh. we only agreed where a direct &amp; contracted commitment. If we concede spares for Buccs. as implied, same point can be taken on naval items.

But don‟t anticipate this. [Exit Ch. Exch. : M.O.D.

M.O.D. U.N. resn. specifically rules out spares.

P.M. But we have allowed Saracen &amp; Ferret spares, on understanding no more. Must consider any future cases on merits.

Let A.G. be consulted about whether £11m. wd. be forfeit and whether option on further 16 is simply with H.M.G. but not part of contract with H.S. [Exit M. Avn.

5. Docks. (oral)

First Secy. E.D.C. have considered enquiry into docks congestion. Labour morale wd. be shaken by external enquiry. M.T., P.B.T. &amp; M. Lab will

therefore constitute inter departmental cttee. of officials for the purpose.

M. Lab. Employers &amp; unions meeting tomorrow to discuss Devlin proposals.

P.M. Consider further on Thursday.
