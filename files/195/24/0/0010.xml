C.M.(64)30 4 June 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

(a)P.M. Concessionary fares for O.A.P.‟s on buses on certain routes. Arbitrary anomalies. Hitherto we have favoured cash grants, spendable at discretion. But unsatisfactory.

Ch.Sec. Existing concession “frozen” by Act of ‟55. Any extension wd. need private legn. promoted by L.A.‟s General Bill already being promoted by Short M.P.

P.M. Should we do it ourselves?

M.P.B.W. Bad principle: right course is to raise O.A.P.‟s at intervals.

L.P. Maybe: but that pass sold in ‟55 Act. Question now is gradual erosion of concession granted there.

P.M. Say we will deal with it in new Parlt. (as Oppn. have promised)?

Ch.Sec. Can‟t then block Short‟s Bill.

(b)M.W.P.(D) Press interest in prices. What do we say?

Ch.Exch. Prices are rising – but perhaps only temporarily. Must relate clearly to earnings.

L.P. But don‟t promise to hold prices – inconsistent with our philosophy.

Ch.Exch. I will circulate a note on future prices, as a “speaking brief”.

(c)M.A.F.F. Govt. stocks in Aberdeen typhoid epidemic a red herring. More important is fact that, after two outbreaks last year, we inspected Argentine shippers and as a result refused consignments from two establishments not chlorinating water.

But consignments from these estabts. already in country were discussed between M.A.F.F. and M/H. and were allowed (without refce. to Ministers – tho‟ this may have made no difference) to remain. Chlorination point not decisive since no chlorination at all before ‟55: but risk may be there and all tins now being called in.

P.M. Facts of M.A.F.F./M/H consultn. shd. be cleared up at once.

M.H. Outbreak may not be due to corned beef. But circumstl. evidence points that way. Awkward since bulk of Govt. stocks date from pre chlorn. days.

P.M. L.P.S. to consider further in his cttee and report tomorrow.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Laos

F.S. Discussions in V: but many dissenters. Therefore endorse Polish proposal for Geneva meeting, wh wd. include co-chairman, L.C.C. member and main parties in Laos. If U.S. will endorse, we can go ahead. We will announce – in anticipation of Labour Party, if possible.

U.S. intentions in Indo-China uncertain: but may be belligerent both in Laos and in S.V-N. (and against N.V-N.). Must be ready to decide how far we shd. support them, when their intentions known after Honolulu confce.. We can‟t provide troops but might send air squadron to Thailand.

b) Congo

F.S. Sitn. deteriorating: U.N. force withdrawing: U. Thant inactive. Will keep Cab. informed.

c) S. Rhodesia.

P.M. Other C‟w. P.M.‟s consider only indept. countries shd. attend Meeting.

Smith might make this excuse for election on indepce. issue, wh. he might win. Might avert this by offering informal discussions before or after Meeting. Will keep Cab. informed.

C.S. After rather than before. Get Ny. indepce. and C‟w. P.M.‟s meeting over before courting risk that unfructuous discussion might precipitate crunch.

Ch.Exch. Equal risks of explosion if S. thinks C‟w. ganging up against him before he comes.?

C.S. Therefore give him option.

3. Legislative Programme. C.P.(64)103 [Enter Sol.Gen.

L.P.S. Subject to later review, drafting of main Bills shd. proceed. Any addns. must be offset by omissions.

S/S.I. Jenkins Cttee. Bill v. formidable. Can‟t be ready till Feb.: shall we want a massive new Bill at that stage?

P.M. Get on with it and deal with it as soon as we can. Addn. A/Soviet Cons. “Covenn.

Ch.Exch. Bill to deal with Burmah Oil point may be necy: tho‟ v. controversial – retrospective legn. against companies after courts have found in their favour!

M.A.F.F. Put Commons Regn. into main programme - introduce in Lords.

L.P.S. I will consider putting drafting in hand.

M.Power. Coal Industry Bill wd. be better in first than second session, since borrowing powers expire at end of ‟65.

M.H.L.G. Landlord and Tenant may have to be accelerated by M. Holland report.

4. Liability of operators of nuclear ships. C.P.(64)107&amp;14.

F.S. Dreadnought problem solved by agreement. But legn. impractical: so let drafting be put in hand, for Bill next Session. Must have clear cut posn.: and only legn. will give us this. Otherwise we are in weak negotiating posn. – see H. Loch agt. and Savannah uncertainty.

P.M. Any value of legn. if U.S. won‟t ratify Convention?

L.Ch. Yes: because U.S. accept liability in accordance with local law.

M.T. Provided final decision reserved till Bill drafted, I accept.

L.Ch. Not good enough. We are going to legislate for Vienna Convention

(incidents on land): how can we face questions when Savannah arrives if we are doing nothing about incidents at sea?

P.M. Draft legn.: let W.P. consider what we shd. say publicly if questions are asked about Savannah.

M.T. But see para 2 of my memm.: inconsistency here.

P.M. Let W.P. consider this (new) point. M.T. shd. then instruct Parly. Counsel to draft on basis that we accept principle.

[Exit M. Transport

5. Damages for loss of earnings. C.P.(64)109

[Enter M. Power

L.Ch. As in memm. Settle with T.U.C. for legn. to disregard half of benefits but not contribns. (Otherwise overcompensation).

L.Adv. No need in Scotland. No deductions of this kind made at all! Scottish T.U.C. wd. be horrified by any change.

L.Ch. Deal only with E. &amp; W. leave Sc. alone.

L.P. But diffl. indefensible. Why not bring law for E. &amp; W. (overcompensn. notwithstanding) into line with law for Sc.

M.P.N.I. See para 11. L.Ch‟s half-measure wd. still produce overcompensn., wh. wd. be embarrassing in light of ban on unempt. benefit if employer maintains wages. Collusion wd. lead to employer delaying wages &amp; leaving man to benefit to extent of half of unempt. benefit. Even more

indefensible if severance payments scheme goes through. And inconsistent with provn in scheme for compensn. for crimes of violence that other payments from public funds will not be disregarded.

L.Ch. But must give T.U.C. some answer on their specific points. Can‟t duck under cover of general issues.

L.P. And, if disregard Sc., L.Ch.‟s proposal reasonable harmonisation of E. and W. law.

Sol.Gen. I agree. Compromise wd. be generally acceptable.

M.Lab. I support M.P.N.I. – particly. as regards war benefits, to which T.U.C. attach greater importance. We could duck under this cover. On issue of principle beware of under penalising persons against whom damages are awarded. 50/50 split of benefit may be rough justice: less certain on contribns., wh. affect ultimate pension.

L.Ch. Contribns. irrelevant to assessment of loss (and therefore damages) I can‟t merely temporise.

Ch.Sec. I support L.Ch. Precedent of sickness benefit and personal injuries etc. shows compromise would work: war benefits really irrelevant from point of view of assessment of damages.

P.M. Tell T.U.C. that we favour this soln. in principle and invite their comments on these proposals.

[Exit M.P.N.I. : Sol.Gen : Adv. Gen.

6. Apple and Pear Quotas. C.P.(64)110

Ch.Exch. Must do something – both for intl. obligns. and for sake of housewife.

But timing?

P.M. Why act before Election at all?

S/S.I. Because quotas unchanged for 10 years, while our own prodn. has increased by 57% and oversea prodn. has also increased. We have favourable trade balance with Italy and ought to help on apples and pears.

Nothing to be gained by delay, when all our commercial policy is at stake.

M.A.F.F. Many of Eur. countries are more protective than we are. Long term policy must be settled by discussn. with them: as regards interim my proposals represent max. wh. N.F.U.‟s wd. accept. Only in May and June does home product not come on market: but I will concede complete libn. from April to July. The 800 tons can be argued both ways: it is trivial in relation to completely libd. imports in April-July. But great help to us presentationally to keep quota at same size, while

adjusting period. In 1953-63 period, imports have risen, both absolutely and proportionately: we are not illiberal.

S/S.I. Extra fortnight in March will affect Canadians as well.

F.S. V. small increase in quota: but defer libn. until later.

M.H. Beware of what may appear another sop to Common Market.

Ch.Exch. But watch effect on prices also.

Ch.Duchy. Irrelevant, since good crop this year. M.A.F.F. is right. Apr.-July libn. next year is as far as we can go – and wd. be a major step.

M.A.F.F. Say now July-Dec quotas unchanged but thereafter under review. Then negotiate (and announce before Elecn!).

S/S.I No intl agt under the K Round until ‟67. We can‟t put our trade in jeopardy until then: and prospects for intl agt on apples and pears v remote anyhow. Therefore concede some relaxn on grounds of own interests. Record my strong views.

P.M. Can‟t liberalise before Election. Merely say some changes after 1.1.‟65: but don‟t announce it till after Elecn. And leave discussns. as late as poss.

F.S. Must help Italians where we can. Prospect of action as from Jan. wd. help. And can tell them that we must consult C‟w.

P.M. As I said: must be ready to liberalise – as M.A.F.F. proposes or more generously – after Elecn.

7. Stationing Costs in Germany. C.P.(64)105&amp;112

Ch.Sec. As in memm. Await German reaction: don‟t appear over eager to conclude on this basis (tho‟, on balance, defensible).

P.M. Agree.

8. German interest in T.S.R.2. (oral) [Enter M.Avn.

P.M. Explained background. Are Cab. content, in view of possible political repercussn. of inviting G. to buy an aircraft wh. can penetrate deep into Russia with nuclear weapons (albeit under key of cupboard safeguard).

S/S.D. G. possess nuclear weapons (including aircraft F104G) already. F.104G may be replaced by one light VTDL and one larger – for wh. U.S. are trying to supply TFX, wh. is roughly equivalent of T.S.R.2. We can‟t therefore refuse to try to sell T.S.R.2. in competn. with U.S.

F.S. I agree.

Ch.Sec. G. complain that we show them less than U.S. We must remedy this, whether they buy T.S.R.2 or not.

M.A.F.F. Try to persuade U.S. not to sell TFX if we don‟t sell T.S.R.2.?

F.S. U.S. wdn‟t agree: and wd. tell G. at once. Must risk possible impact on S.U. rather than handicap our own aircraft industry in competn. with U.S.

S/SD. At present, warheads wd. be U.S. and therefore on k. of c. basis.

P.M. On this basis, tolerable domestically and internationally.
