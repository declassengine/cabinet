C.M.(64)38 16 July 1964. 10 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

M.W.P.(C) Risk of two defeats in Lords in final week – S. Rh. civil servants and hard court martial.

P.M. Must stand firm on both cases. But will consider presentation.

2. Meeting of C‟wealth P.M.s. (oral)

P.M. Important shd. succeed – after last two.

Nyerere v. doubtful – under Communist influence. Marjai frightful. Kena. good.

Africans tried to avoid supporting Malaysia: but we prevailed. Not a real bloc.

Kashmir: prospects of settlement doubtful, but at least agreed refce. in communiqué to public statements.

On S. Rh. Nigeria v. helpful. We insisted on no force: our responsy.; and therefore we have a breathing space in which to talk to Smith. But unless we can get a new constl. confce. pretty soon, there will be an exile Govt. in N. Rh. and real trouble.

On economies, they were satisfied with our UNCTAD performance.

Projects valuable in cementing collabn.

Sect. a volte-face: also location in London!

On the whole, we came out of it reasonably well.

On Cyprus, all (Kypriaion apart) stuck to Resns. of U.N.

Little African conviction about cold war: they want non-alignment.

C.S. V. content with result – particuly. as regards S.Rh. where all views expressed are those of other P.M.‟s and we merely promise to bear them in mind.

Satisfactory divergence of views on B.G. - and recorded admission by Nkrumah that may be necy. to revert to colonial rule.

General desire to build up C‟w.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Iraq

M.W.P.(C) Iraq has legislated to nationalise banks and industrial firms. Provides in principle for compensn. Have therefore merely put up marker on this. Iraq moving fast towards Egypt. (Oil companies unaffected so far.)

b) Cyprus

M.W.P.(C) NATO Council condemned Greek build up in Cyprus.

Conversations at Geneva will be unproductive.

c) U.S.A.

S/S.I. Cabinet wd. like infmn about Goldwater and implications of a Repn. victory in November. Minimum circulation.

d) Trade

S/S.I. Figures for May published tomorrow. Biggest import total ever. Why? Stock-piling said to have ceased! Suspend judgment until breakdown in fortnight.

Ch.Exch. Incomprehensible. But export prospects good: and sterling reasonably firm.

e) Public order

S/S.I. Attack on Kenyatta disturbing. Second incident of this kind. Review secy. precautions for intl. visitors.

H.S. Can‟t guard everybody on scale reserved for Nkrumah.

Demonstrations more arguable – a free country. Cd. use sessional order to keep streets clear within a mile of W‟minster. But difficult to prevent peaceful expression of opinion.

Will investigate &amp; report to Cab. on “people with banners”.

M.A.F.F. If attack was by Fascists, police carelessness even more inexcusable.

C.S. Watch effect on African attitude in Kenya towards Europeans there.

M.W.P.(D) Public disquiet about police – both because powers inadequate and because powers not being exercised for fear of people in high places.

M.A.F.F. Daily Mirror is fomenting new series of scandalous rumours.

H.S. Protection rackets are going on. But no evidence for alleged case involving a peer.

L.Ch. Remember last year. Rumours being fomented for political reasons.

Police must be more active.

P.M. Watch this. Oppn. will be v. dirty.

Let Ministers disclose privately to me whatever they hear.

3. Malta. (oral) [Enter M/D. for Air

C.S. Present law says improper influence if you threaten to inflict moral or material injury. Our law says spiritual or temporal injury.

M. courts have regard to intention: and moral was intended not to encroach on influence of Church. Change of wording acceptable to Vatican and Arch. B. of M.

L.Ch. But subject of m. and m. for s. and t. was our work – because less

danger of offending R.C. Church.

C.S. Therefore to change is unacceptable to B.O. If we gave way, he might accept nuclear provision in def. agt. But now no time to legislate: and Bill wd. be contentious. Labour Party wd. oppose.

L.Ch. If we can get good def. agt. etc. might promise to legislate in next Parlt. since difficult to break on something which is M. Court‟s own business. (cf. interference in S. Rh., wh. we have explicitly refused to do.)

P.M. But cd. Labour Party say Consve. Party Papist &amp; reactionary?

M.W.P.(C) But difficult to refuse indepce. on ground that M. won‟t change a law passed under our administration.

Ch.Exch. Legislate as we like: and let them change it afterwards.

C.S. Drop our point: get def. agt. on nuclear weapons: and legislate?

L.P.S. Not in this Session.

M.H. Then play it long till after Election.

L.Ch. If so, whole thing may slip. Better to do it now even tho‟ agt. need not necy. be made public.

Ch.Whip. Labour Party wd. oppose Bill. Therefore sign agt. and promise to legislate later.

P.M. Is political risk of being called Papist less than risk of failing to reach agt.?

C.S. Not certain I can get a bargain of nuclear agt. for electoral law.

I was told to break on church: I can. Do Cab. now want me to break on nuclear issue?

S/S E.S. Folly to sacrifice nuclear agt. if we can get it.

P.M. On balance, despite Mintoff, better to keep B.O. in power with def. agt. even tho‟ M. may break it if he comes into power. (When we might have to act by force to keep Island.)

C.S. Even so, if we now settle thus, Labour Party wd. denounce. Is this all right?

S/S.I. Wd. they want to appear to refuse indepce. to M. in order to get a pro- UAR Govt. in power.

P.M. If Church &amp; defence can be settled, we will say we will legislate in

next Parlt. Must accept publicn. of details.

C.S. Plus uncondl. financial aid for 3 years: linked with def. agt. thereafter.

(Can‟t avoid aid for 3 years, whether def. agt. or not.)

Ch.S. But uncondl. aid makes it easier to repudiate def. agt.. And D.O.P.C. were anxious on point. But I don‟t insist, if Cab. content.

P.M. Agree. [Exit C.S.

4. V.C.10‟s. C.P.(64)141&amp;142 [Enter M. Avn.

L.P.S. Reported two possible courses. Majority favoured cancelln. of 12 or 10. I have a third compromise.

P.M. Can‟t pay a lot for nothing!

M.Avn. BOAC will take, on numbers, whatever we decide. After 1968, will need 47, not 40!

We decided that BOAC shd. buy British: and we and aircraft industry have put a lot into developing V.C.10. Important for technological future.

Cancellation therefore v. bad. And, if he keeps Boeings, he will still look to U.S. for subsonic replacements. Sale prospects of V.C.10 wd. be jeopardised. If no cancellations, picture reversed. Oppn. wd. probably support us in no cancellations.

[Re-enter C.S.

Ch.Exch. BOAC have ordered 13 too many aircraft – 60 instead of 47.

And Guthrie wd. prefer to have no V.C.10‟s.

And some £30m. at stake. Unjustifiable for this purpose. Consider consequences of thrusting V.C.10‟s down throat of unwilling BOAC, and compelling them to sell good Boeings while still useful &amp; economic. See my memm on public exports.

L.Ch. Bad to aim, long term, at mixed fleet. If as M. Avn. proposes, only 7 Boeings in predominantly Br. fleet.

M/S. RAF Subsonic aircraft will go on into 70‟s. Therefore new Boeings inescapable, whereas V.C.10‟s now wd. extend into 80‟s. We shd. avoid a “second buy”.

And technical features of V.C.10 (shorter take off etc.) valuable in C‟wealth.

Ch.Sec. Sale price of Boeings wd. be low. They have special engines.

M.P.B.W. Must take broad view. Don‟t damage export prospects of aircraft industry - for BAC lll as well as V.C.10.

M.A.F.F. Ch. Exch wins on economic arguments. Are these offset by cancellation of – not all – but only 10 or 12? Damage already done by public discussion of possibility of cancellation. Wd. it be so, v. much more damaged by cancelln. of 10?

S/S.I. Economics of airline conflict with economics of aircraft industry. Former favour Boeings. Latter don‟t necy. favour V.C.10‟s – can we really afford to keep aircraft industry going, at vast cost, for prestige reasons? Compare £30m. here with eg. £2m. for nuclear ship and our enforced economies elsewhere.

The 10 to be cancelled are already frozen. And mixed fleet gives BOAC chance to decide, re replacements, in light of experience.

We have emphasised commercial basis of natd. industries. How reconcile this with proposal?

M.P.B.W. £30m. is capital sum: not a continuing subsidy.

H.S. Don‟t cancel. Cancelln. charges v. damaging politically – charges of bad planning, wasteful expre. etc.

L.P.S. I agree – in short term. But risk of damage to our reputation for commercial judgment also involved. ?Better to suspend judgement on the 10, for practical reasons that other possible uses must be explored. And no extra expre.

Ch.Exch. Aircraft industry v. expensive – see Concord, T.S.R.2 etc. Can‟t accept this on top of rising expre. generally.

Ch.Sec. Can‟t defer decision. Must get BOAC on business like basis forthwith. And postponement also politically damaging.

L.P. U.S. Govt. subsidise their aircraft industry and try to dominate world markets in all types of technology. We must resist this and give support to our own advanced industries. Better to spend the £30m.

Ch.Exch. We can‟t compete across whole field. Concentrate on selected issues.

C.S. Backing of Concord is reason for, not against V.C.10‟s. If we had wanted to abandon the industry, we shd. have done it on Concord etc. also.

M.H.L.G. I agree. We can‟t stop at this stage.

Ch.S. No qun of stopping. BOAC have ordered too many: therefore sensible to cancel orders for aircraft, not yet in existence.

M.Avn. Orders will depend on experience in early years. But if prodn. line not assured till end 68 (as wd. be possible if order for 10 stands), prospects are good. Otherwise damaged.

Postponement till end of year feasible, with no increase in cancelln.

charges.

But reasons for it are pretty tenuous: and we shd. be no nearer knowing whether V.C.10 a winner.

M.T. And damaging publicity wd. continue.

Since BOAC are prepared to take some V.C.10‟s, better go whole hog.

Ch.Exch. But, even in best ec. circs. current expre. means £200m. of addl. taxn.

M.H. I agree. Indefensible to spend more if BOAC don‟t want the aircraft!

M.Lab. I agree. Back L.P.S.: &amp; avoid second buy.

Ch.Exch. I would accept, provided made clear no decision yet on last 10 and presented as deliberate choice to fly British.

P.M. Explore compromise further. Promise statement on Monday.

Avoid any presentation of ”buying British or American”. We resist other countries, attempts to do this and mustn‟t do it ourselves. And avoid any presentn as a compromise or failure to encourage BOAC to put house in order. And avoid any presentn. wh. Oppn. wd. claim was economic autarky – i.e. their policy, wh. we attack.

Present as decision not to decide on last 10 until further enquiry into size of future fleet and technical characteristics as well.

[Exit M. Avn.
