C.M.(64)35 7 July 1964. 10 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

L.P. Crockford‟s offer to buy Aintree - £ for £ with Govt. if we will amend Betting Act – i.e. let them run sweepstakes on Grand National!

Answer – No!

P.M. Not easy politically!

M.H.L.G. But L‟pool housing problem urgent. And injection of private este housing v. desirable.

L.P. And wrong to link amdt. of Act (whether desirable or not) with purchase of particular piece of land. Cd. be repeated!

P.M. Reject, quickly. L.P. with Tsy. and other Ministers to draft.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Spain (oral)

F.S. Spain might suspend judgment on altve. contract for 3 months. They can‟t, or don‟t want to, buy elsewhere. But must decide on 10/7 – or so they say. Do we try for delay – for a few months, on basis that we wish to maintain contract. But no question of consulting Oppn. or even advising Spain to do so.

P.M. Political advantage to secure deferment? But might appear to be conniving with a foreign Govt in a manner likely to affect Election.

Cd. say privately that we hope no irrevocable action for a few months: but avoid public statement by Spain? At least must appear to be spontaneous gesture by Spain, and avoid any appearance of bargain or attempt by Spain to help Consves. at Election. Also avoid any refce. to 3 months.

b) Italy (oral)

F.S. Moro invited to form new Govt.

c) Congo (oral)

F.S. Tshombe now invited to form a Govt. One up to us!

d) S. Rhodesia (oral)

P.M. May have to advance discussion at P.M.M.: and Africans may make a row. But moderates may help us to maintain the constl. issue before this Meeting. Circulate our T.A. proposals to Cab.

3. I.T.V. industrial relations. (oral)

Ch.Exch. If employers concede e.g. 8%, must openly condemn.

M.H. I agree. This is H.W.‟s doing, tho‟ he now pretends he got involved by accident.

M.W.P.(D) Watch relation between this claim and postmen‟s claim. Margin cd. be embarrassing.

4. Malta. (oral)

C.S. Deadlock. a) France not insuperable. b) Defence broken on issue of storage of nuclear weapons in Malta – wh. we can‟t accept, not so much qua Malta as qua precedent for e.g. Singapore. c) Amdt. of electoral law to prevent undue influence by R.C. Church, where our stand is justified by report of observers during recent refm.

Might get agt. on c), with support of Vatican. Hold in reserve as best grounds of break. But B.O. will base break on (b) – awkward.

He may even ask for indepce. without a) &amp; b): but we shd. have to insist on (c). If he swallows this too, we are in real trouble.

P.M. How can we concede indepce. without (b)?

C.S. Shd. have to say we are not prepared to concede it on that basis. This is what wd. be awkward.

Ch.Exch. He cd. amend constn. after indepce.

C.S. Yes – but immediate hurdle is H/C.

P.M. If Mintoff gets in, Malta goes over to U.A.R. That is reason for settling with B.O., if at all possible. Only altve. is to break and maintain colonial status.

C.S. At cost of offending B.O. and undermining his posn. – thus helping M.

Must we break on nuclear weapons? He will concede transit. Do repercussions elsewhere matter – in Cyprus (a S.B.A.); Malaysia – wh. wdn‟t quarrel on this; and Aden (where same arguments apply).

P.M. S/S.D. (absent sick) wd. take it seriously. But a break on this will raise issue as much as on agt. Latter cd. be unobtrusive.

Ch.Whip. Parly. time only just available – if wholly uncontentious!

P.M. Precedent wd be for U.S. as well as for us.

H.S. Maltese don‟t want indepce. &amp; wdn‟t let M. ally with U.A.R.

And a private understanding on n. weapons cdn‟t be concealed from Parlt.; nor wd. B.O. conceal it in Malta.

P.M. Reconsider. [Exit C.S.

[Enter S/S.I.

5. U.S. Shipping Legislation. C.P.(64)132

[Enter A.G.

S/S.I. See new Bill, drafted after Cab. discussn. and in consultn. with L. Ch.

Cl. 1 more limited – to direct clash – than U.S. legn. On this basis justifiable to treat as a criminal offence: and heavy penalties.

Cl.2 still fairly wide – but only permissive, impracticable to make compulsory.

Bill does not resolve conflict; and ships will still be liable to U.S. penalties. But it does define conflict and therefore establishes case before I. Court: Industry supports it.

M.T. Also ship owners (who feared that wide powers wd. be abused by Labour Govt.) Shippers also.

A.G. Penalties provisions follow precedent.

Parly S. Avn shd. be added to list of Ministers at top of p.3 – i.e. on documents.

M. Avn

P.M. Agree. Are criminal penalties appropriate?

H.S. Yes: unusual but acceptable in circs.

P.M. Why a (small) figure for individuals? And only once for all?

F.S. Better to have some specific figures.

A major event in UK/US relations: avoid a F.O. Minister‟s intervention in debate.

P.M. M.T. to open and A.G. to wind up: and to concert with M.W.P.(D) publicity on introdn. Bring in Ch. Whip &amp; discuss advisy. of Statement tomorrow. Keep other European powers in touch.

I will send another message to U.S. Prest.: F.O. to draft.

[Exeunt A.G.: Parly Sec. M. Avn.

6. Earnings-Related Benefits. C.P.(64)128

[Enter M.P.N.I.

Ch.Exch. Don‟t dissociate from old &amp; sick. Therefore reserve for Manifesto.

M.P.N.I. I wd. agree: but not easy to remain silent if a Supply Day debate.

Ch.Duchy. One tomorrow in Lords!

M.Lab. And, on economic grounds, ought to anticipate Oppn. – e.g. in P.M.‟s speech during N.W. tour on 24 July.

Ch.Sec. But must first resolve priorities with old and sick.

P.M. But to reserve for public speech early in Sept. Deal with Parlt. as best we can.

7. Concessionary Fares. (oral)

Ch.Sec. Have re-examined. 1955 decision to freeze posn. (following judgment that existing practice illegal) was strictly drafted. Therefore changes in routes or types of service are cause of friction, if L.A. wants to maintain concession. Consultn. with M.P.‟s concerned and with H.A. shows we can‟t do nothing: we can‟t (without raising whole issue) legislate only to “validate” existing concessions: we ought therefore to announce we will consult L.A.‟s affected about legn. to preserve existing concession in next Session.

H.S. H.A. Agreed.

P.M. ?Wiser to review whole issue of principle with all L.A.‟s – and thus get rid of it altogether.

Ch.S. Wd. create a row and reverse our own decision in 1955. Bad tactics.

M.T. Must consult L.A. assocn. in any case, since scope of existing concessions (e.g. blind: children) not clear.

L.P.S. Why not extend concessionary fares in off-peak hours? Might get this agreed by wider enquiry.

P.M. And other cities might like to introduce concessions?

Ch.S. Maybe: don‟t exclude wider enquiry but make clear must come later. First thing is to prevent people from losing what they have got.

P.M. Agree. M.T. to announce (by special arrangement). Written P.Q. for answer tomorrow, as basis for mention in tomorrow‟s debate.

8. School Buildings Survey. C.P.(64)131

L.P. Background. Eccles‟ enquiry - £1200m. of “deficiencies”. If publish, W.P. is about as good as can be. But ?unwise to publish before Election.

E.R.P. Cttee. endorsed this view, accepting risk of leak.

Ch.S. I agree. Publicn. wd. be damaging. Therefore sit on it, if possible.

M/S. E.S. I agree. Avoid minuting decision not to publish!

P.M. Can we answer P.Q.‟s?

M/S. E.S. Yes. 1962 material: therefore out of date
