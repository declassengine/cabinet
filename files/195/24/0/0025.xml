C.M.(64)45 18 August 1964. 11.30 a.m.

1. Cyprus. (oral) [Enter M/D. RAF : C.A.S.

F.S. Uneasy truce in C. M. slightly easier about revictualling T. communities: and U.N. force has pre-cautiously inserted troops between G. &amp; T. in worst areas.

Geneva. Efforts at peacemaking continue: and G &amp; T discussns. still in train.

G. have offered small T. base beyond Dhekalia – a welcome initiative, rejected by T. who prefer D. Acheson‟s proposal for base in northern prong. G. reaction awaited. G. wd. supplement small base with use of Famagusta: and wd. concede sovty. But prospects not bright.

Mediator. Now incapacitated by stroke and out of the picture. U. Th. won‟t take over himself and proposes to substitute Spinelli (ex Yemen).

Must acquiesce and back Geneva efforts so far as we can to avoid G &amp; T war.

S.Union. Intervention by Tass release &amp; K. speech. H.M. Ambr. does not think indicates decision to intervene. But member of Cyp. Govt. F.O. has gone to Moscow: and S.U. may begin to press on T. frontiers. (But T. not taking seriously).

U.S. have suggested guarantor Powers shd. intervene and repudiate Soviet note. But if we are to shape up to S.U., we must have U.S. with us: and we have told them so. We have also reverted to S.C. resn. of 9 August deprecating third party intervenn.; and we have suggested U. Th. shd. warn S.U. accordingly. U.S. agree.

Greece. Pap. assured us that he cd. enforce Enosis on Mak. and cd. supplant him, if necy. Not borne out by his present attitude, wh. we ought to re-ascertain – since Mak. still insisting on self-detmn. endorsed by G.A. resn. But this means a Medn. Cyprus &amp; wd. provoke T. intervn.

N.A.T.O. Both G &amp; T have now withdrawn troops. ?Activate N.A.T.O. to get G &amp; T together &amp; maintain Alliance.

Families. H. C. recommends keep under review in light of domestic &amp; intl. devts; but don‟t move yet. Do we agree?

C.S. M. pursuing policy of creeping advance: and can‟t rely on no further incidents.

On families, risk hitherto has been T. landing in north and advance on Nicosia. Now add risks of G. seizure of N. and T. aerial bombardment of it. But don‟t move yet – too great danger of charge of connivance with T. if they move afterwards.

Must eliminate C. as unitary, indept state, wh. wd. give M. too much power to intrigue with S.U. &amp; U.A.R. Therefore press on with negotns. based on compensn. for T. for Enosis and safeguards for T. remaining in C.

There must be greater protection for lives and property in exchange for surrender of constl. right of veto. That means intl. control of police in C. for some years. T. base shd. be primarily not military but area of

asylum for T.

We must outmanoeuvre M‟s attempt to steamroller G.A. in autumn. Therefore back Grivas and use N.A.T.O. to help G. Govt. to stand up to M.

P.M. Agree must support Gen. talks &amp; back Spinelli. Must aim at Enosis on basis described by C.S. But ability of G. Govt. to control M. via Grivas v. doubtful: and can‟t see how to arrange fair plebiscite on Enosis – unless M. deposed!

M.L. Von Platen an altve. to Spinelli?

M.W.P.(C) Must back Geneva: but nothing acceptable to M. will come out of it.

C.S. Can‟t lose more time. M.‟s posn. will be strengthened if G.A. pass resn. in favour of unitary state. Political decision must precede G.A. meeting.

P.M. May have to act even faster – if T. invade or S.U. invade.

If only we cd. arrange, jointly with G &amp; T to eliminate M.!

M.W.P.(C) But S.U. intervenn. has strengthened M.‟s resolve to wait for G.A.; and he has probably bribed Grivas with promise that this will be necessary prelude to Enosis.

It has also strengthened Gk. Govt.‟s hand by putting T. into potential baulk.

P.M. Must go on backing Geneva: and ask Pap. how far he is still with us in trying to control M. and to work for Enosis.

Leave to F.S. to decide whether, &amp; when, to summon N.A.T.O. Minl. Council.

Wd. visit by Acheson to Athens help?

Shd. we promote a G.-T. resn. in G.A. to counter Mak‟s resn.?

M/D. RAF Slight easing of mily. sitn. Gks. now avoiding clash until G.A.

M.W.P.(D) Must avoid appearance of inactivity and “leaving it to Acheson”. How do we give show of initiative?

F.S. Can‟t do more: Hood is at Geneva. But a N.A.T.O. initiative wd. help.

P.M. On families? Especially if T. renew invasion.

L.Ch. If Ach. fails, cd. move families without risk of connivance with T?

C.A.S. C.B.F. &amp; H. Cm. agree can‟t defend families if fighting breaks out over Nicosia. Our forces there cdn‟t stand against Grivas‟s.

M/D. RAF But still wait. T. move wd. increase tension and risk of charge of connivance with T. And N. within reach of T. airfields – so risk of Gk.

seizures not great.

Ch.Sec. But have always assumed hitherto N. wd. be available. If no longer true, great risk in leaving families. I support L. Ch.

C.S. Must also make a road evacn. plan.

M.H. Less significant to withdraw them now? If wait for breakdown of Geneva sitn. will be serious anyhow.

L.Ch. But it might sabotage the talks.

M/D. RAF To move them only to SBA‟s pointless. Either bring home or – preferably – wait a bit longer. No Gk. wd. land on N. airport within striking distance of T. aircraft.

C.A.S. I agree. Gk. mily. action wd. have to attack T. aircraft at source.

Equally T. unlikely to attack N. airport unless there is a Gk. target there.

Even if mily. action resumed, we ought still to be able to use N.

But if mandate not extended, U.N. protecn. of N. no longer available; and then must move them out.

P.M. Review daily: if Geneva talks fail, may have to act.

M.W.P.(C) I share L. Ch.‟s view. If T. attack again, Gk. anti British feeling wd. be v. intense. I wd. move them now.

M/S. RAF But it wd. heighten tension; and put evacuees to great inconvenience.

Ch.Duchy. At least say publicly today that, if G. talks fail, we shall move them?

L.Ch. No: wd. risk sabotaging talks.

P.M. Leave it to me, F.S. C.S. etc. to judge from day to day. Add a road plan?

C.A.S. C.B.F. advises against: roads too congested and air movement preferable, even if N. airport under attack. But road plan exists.

2. Law &amp; Order: Escape of prisoner from Winson Green

Prison. (oral)

H.S. Took great secy. precautions with all Train Robbery prisoners – dispersal; removal of clothes: regular &amp; frequent inspection. These were adequate if no collusion inside prison. 3 keys required for escape: this points to collusion, especially since prison gate, tho‟ ordinarily locked, not locked with special secy. key!

Investign. proceeding. Other prisons concerned being checked by Govrs. with local Chief Constables; staff being strengthened. One gap

detected at B‟ham – now being rectified.

All our experience is in preventing 20.000 prisoners from getting out:

Little experience in preventing people from getting in! New risk, wh. we must equip ourselves to face. Answer is not proposal to concentrate secy. prisoners in one place. But better precautions necy., (especially since murderers now sentenced to life imprisonment) for v. long sentences. Special prison may be necy. ; and special measures – electronic devices: closed circuit T.V. etc - may be required in existing prisons.

F.S. And tighten up on access by visitors and relatives.

H.S. Yes.
