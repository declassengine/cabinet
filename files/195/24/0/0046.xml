C.C.(65)2 19 January 1965. 11 a.m.

1. Sir Winston Churchill. (oral)

P.M. Planning in hand. Queen will order State funeral and lying in state.

Appropriate tributes on T.V.

Parliamentary action dependent on time of death: but adjournment for one day. Timing of funeral also dependent on circumstances: must allow time for large number of foreign visitors.

Economic statement to be postponed – in order to have clear run with publicity. But export rebates scheme must, for mechanical reasons, be allowed to proceed today.

Deptl. Ministers to supplement tributes as appropriate. If so, preferably co-ordinate through No. 10. But avoid Party politics.

2. Cabinet proceedings. (oral)

P.M. Three leaks – Casement: postal charges: R. Cmn. on trades unions etc.

Last may be result of necessary consultns.: second may be intelligent surmise. Even so, damaging to collective responsibility. Essential to avoid compulsive talking – and to be accompanied by Press Officer when interviewing Press in any circumstances.

First Secy. Does it happen at official level – to prejudice Minl. deliberations?

P.M. On aircraft, industry probably responsible. But watch it!

3. Comprehensive Secondary Education. C.(65)4

S/S. E.S. As in memm. Oppn. will emphasise local difficulties. In fact L.E.A.‟s proposing reorgn. account for ⅔ of relevant popn. But vary in methods etc: hence need for national principles, to avoid unsatisfy. experiments and individual arguments between Whitehall &amp; each L.E.A. Must adhere to basic principle of no segregation at 11+: but be flexible in admn. Hence proposal for circular as in para 5. Few will not respond: but legal power required to deal with those who do.

A long job: but we cd. create acceptance of pattern as normal during next five years – and difficulties will then be overcome.

Base debate on statement of policy to this effect.

P.M. A good memm.

Is legn. necessary – or politic? ?Better to wait until we meet some L.E.A. opposition.

Ch.Duchy. I agree. Threat of legn. unwise if early Election likely.

First Secy. I endorse policy: but pressure on L.E.A.‟s will generate pressure on resources. ⅔ of secondary children already in post-war bldgs. – but not primary children. Latter may therefore suffer by diversion, unless additional resources made available.

Ch.Exch. How far can existing buildings be used? Edn. already increasing by 6% p.a. and this can‟t increase indefinitely. Primary schools &amp; raising of leaving age (in 1970?) have strong claims: also universities. These proposals can therefore be met only by diversion.

I also doubt need for legn. – wh. might be v. unpopular, since (unless majority support overwhelming) minority cd. be quite large.

Must emphasise width of curriculum in c. schools.

M.H.L.G. Agree main emphasis must be on primary schools. But cheapest types of c. school are worst. Therefore make timing v. flexible.

Try to do it voluntarily – avoid legn. and work by example.

If we exclude indepts., direct-grants &amp; denoml. schools &amp; introduce c. principle itself by gradualism, essential to avoid legn. – wh. will be much more necessary when we come to indept. schools etc.

S/S.S. Not controversial in Scot. But legn. unwise.

It is raising of age in 1970 wh. makes it essential to get c. principle established now.

M.A.F.F. 11+ only reflects segregn. – does not cause it. It results from differences in staff etc. Therefore put emphasis on ending segretn., rather than on ending 11+. Don‟t be too afraid of legn.

S/S.W. Agree on need for national policy. Legn. needed for this – e.g. of 1944 Act.

Might start on assumpn. of 100% co-opn.: but ? stipulate date and be ready, if necy., to indicate legn.

S/S.D. I agree. Let legn. be seen to be necy. before we introduce it.

But don‟t let L.E.A.‟s rely on absence of legn. to become evasive.

Therefore I agree with S/S.W.

L.P.S. I originally supported legn.: but am converted by S/S.W.

L.Ch. Try persuasion first: keep legn. wholly in reserve.

L.P. Don‟t let Oppn. say we are threatening legn.: and don‟t emphasise threat to direct grant schools – especially take over by L.E.A.‟s.

P.B.T. Keep hands free on legn.: commitment now unwise.

M.H.L.G. Para 3(iii) – “can mean” – obscure.

S/S.E.S. On para 3(iii), parents can choose one c. school rather than another.

But true that, while a grammar school gives escape from bad neighbourhood, c. school doesn‟t. But this is counsel of despair: and answer lies in housing &amp; social policy – to which good c. school can contribute!

I agree it is segregation rather then 11+ which matters. I will make this clear – by emphasising width of courses in c. schools.

Mere postponement of segretn. for a few years will not be acceptable – e.g. Leicestershire experiment shd. be encouraged &amp; grammar schools gradually turned into senior c. schools.

On direct grant schools, limited discussions allow me to indicate that they may widen admission. But tactically wiser to avoid provoking opposition at this stage.

Claim on resources will arise from increase in number of school children – not from these proposals. Cheaper may not mean nastier – only slower, if we are not to demand more resources. Some extra demand inevitable: but need not be substantial. If demand refused, must simply go more slowly.

Method (ii) can often help.

No L.E.A. likely to prejudice primary schools: but I shall watch this.

On legn., it wd. be designed not only to compel but to help. L.E.A. may have to close a school to effect reorgn: this may meet oppn.: and new legn. wd. help. But main argt. is attitude of Oppn. – who will ask if legn. is contemplated. What do I say?

P.M. Not unless it is proved to be necessary. Otherwise, policy approved.

S/S.E.S. Better to say - “Yes, if it proves necessary to help L.E.A.‟s”. But wd. accept P.M.‟s formula initially and mine if pressed thereafter. Must avoid commitment not to legislate.

Ch.Exch. Bulge already allowed for in educn. expre. forecasts. Can c. reorgn. be accommodated within this? If any extra resources, somebody else must go short.
