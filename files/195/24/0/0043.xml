C.C.(64)15 15 December 1964. 11 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P. As in statement.

H.S. On Abolition of Death Penalty Bill, any Minister who favours retention shd. preferably abstain. Ministers shd. advise junior Mins. accordingly.

P.M. Yes – but no pressure.

2. Defence Policy. (oral)

P.M. In Oppn. we agreed to ask for joint talks with Govt. Shd. we repeat the offer now? We cd. argue we were trying to take defence out of politics: and Oppn. wd. be in a dilemma whether to leave it in politics or to deprive themselves of right to criticise. Moreover, Oppn. – unlike ourselves – know the facts: so we shdn‟t be giving them anything, at least for a year or so – and even thereafter it might be useful in preventing our defence policy from becoming a merely political issue. S/S. Def. (absent) agrees.

First Secy. Will it embarrass us with our own left-wing?

P.M. Only if they thought we were trading our views – wh. we aren‟t.

Agreed.

3. Law Commissions. C.(64)27 [Enter Ch. Secy. Tsy. : A.G. : S.G./S

Ch. Duchy. As in memm: problem of deptl. responsy. Easier in Scotland;: but in E. &amp; W. Ld. Ch. does not have S/S.S‟s responsibilities.

L.Ch. Happier if Cn entitled to free hand. Need for reform derives from leaving reform to Depts. – nobody reviews law as a whole.

But acquiesce. Explany. W.P. with Bill.

P.M. Agree: and suitable Press briefing by L.Ch. &amp; S/S.S.

[Exeunt A.G &amp; S/Gen.S.

4. Transport Co-ordination. (oral)

First Secy. Division of opinion in E.D.C. Majority against Beeching proposal – the wrong man; hostility of T.U.‟s: and period too short.

M.Techy. I opposed it. Railway unions in particular have no confidence in Beeching, who does not believe in public ownership and has no sense of social responsy.

P.M. Can‟t have individual appts. going to Cab. Cttees. I saw Beeching and was satisfied he wd. give us type of report we want. I suspect 5

months too short: but we cd. prob. extend if necy. Most serious objn. is one man nature of study. Essential that all interests shd. be consulted. Therefore advisory panel, with both road &amp; rail unions, road employers and some independents – e.g. Jackson (Oxford Instt. of Statistics).

On publicn., avoid commitment to publish in full: publicn. of costs of road haulage may be embarrassing.

First Secy. Not the appointment but the project wh. came under criticism.

M.H.L.G. Comments meet my objns. to considerable extent – particularly assocn. of other experts.

M.Lab. Unions don‟t distrust B.‟s ability – only his industrial relations competence!

In fact he is an ardent co-ordinator. My only objn. is shortness of period: but a lot of evidence available already.

M.T. Must emphasise B. only to do a study: no qun of executive over-lordship. But he wants co-ordn. and integn.: and will do study well, provided not over burdened with people whom he must consult &amp; convince.

I agree on no commitment to publish. But we must be ready to honour our Manifesto – at least by end of ‟65: and long-winded committee wd. be too protracted. Better to leave to B, with such expert advice as he needs – economists, unions etc.

M.Techy. I am unconvinced: B. is a private enterpriser. Other transport interests don‟t agree with B, because he favours making railways pay at expense of other transport. T.G.W. and N.U.R. will continue to oppose.

M.H.L.G. My doubts revive. Five months is too short. And B. must be “burdened” with certain number of experts, who must contribute to discussn. and report and not merely be assessors. B. alone wd. be too biased in favour of “axing”. Must have a formal committee.

P.M. Manifesto commits us to early and quick study. Geddes cttee., with narrower terms of refce., will take two years.

A formal cttee. wd. never reach agreement – in 100 years.

We have never criticised Beeching personally: and he has shown willing to co-operate with us, despite our reversal of closures procedure.

M.T. B. himself said his original remit wrong: now we are giving him the right remit.

P.M. And N.O.P.‟s all showed support for B. approach.

Agree that full scale enquiry shd. be undertaken if necessary when B. has done his initial survey. Hope unnecessary, for sake of timetable: and don‟t announce now.

And support him with definite panel of assessors. And import some

refce. to social factors in T. of R. also refce. to “expanding economy”.

5. Prices &amp; Incomes. (oral)

First Secy. Decln. of Intent to be signed tomorrow. Not a bad beginning: but next stages – machinery &amp; guidelines – will be even tougher.

Maximise publicity for signing: great psychological impact required to get domestic economy moving and restore intl. confidence. Work in hand on next stages.

P.M. W‟ton visit showed importance qua intl. opinion. Problem of foreign confidence not yet solved.

M.Lab. Tribute to First Secy.

M.Tech. I have reservations. Do signatories mean what they are signing? Or is it a meaningless gesture? Therefore don‟t go out too far on a limb.

6. Salaries of Higher Judiciary. C.(64)26

L.Ch. As in memm. Amount for later considns.

First Secy. Sub cttee on I. and P. thought action now unwise: but must discharge commitment during Session – therefore in June or July, with only confidl. disclosures to Dilhouse etc. at this stage. Stall on P.Q.‟s.

P.M. Agreed.
