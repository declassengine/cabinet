C.M.(64)48 22 September 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Official Information Services during the Election. (oral)

P.M. Will circulate in minutes guidance on use of Govt. Infmn. services during Election.

2. The Queen‟s visit to Canada. (oral)

P.M. Constl. right of Can. Govt. to advise: but we have an interest.

Therefore have concerted formula with Can. Govt. as amended?

L.Ch. Omit “undue danger”.

P.M. Agree: real danger v. small. And v. humiliating – and dangerous precedent - to cancel visit.

3. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Cyprus

F.S. Must still rely on Acheson (&amp; Brosio) to keep us in touch. Posn.quiescent.

b) S.E. Asia

F.S. No risk of U.S. retaln. to latest incident in Gulf of Tonkin. Sitn. v. shaky.

Sukarno going on tour: we are warning Br. subjects to leave quickly, if possible.

c) Arabia

F.S. Arab Summit gone quietly. Proposal qua Jordan waters won‟t harm Israel.

Nasser – Faisal discussn. on Yemen has yielded some prospect of mediation. But Royalists holding well: and Faisal being v. careful.

S/S.I. Singapore restrictions on textiles removed. But they want same quota as Singapore: impossible – &amp; negotns. therefore suspended. But little risk that they will re-impose restrictions before Election – they will wait for its result first and will resume at end of Oct.

4. Economic Situation. (oral)

Ch.Exch. No real domestic inflation: no great pressure on labour. Indl. prodn. index clearly wrong – discounts work in progress.

But trade figures disappointing. Exports slackening – tho‟ shd. rise (and imports fall) during winter. Gap aggravated by rise in import prices. No case for general deflationary measures.

Seasonally bad month for £ - aggravated by trade gap &amp; Election. But posn being held: no sign of basic lack of confidence; we are using arranged borrowing rights. Must consider form of announcement at

end of month.

Election keynote: 4% agreed growth rate: will require great effort: we have done our part: what remains – incomes policy and restve. practices – calls for co-opn. of others. Labour Party‟s programme wd. wreck the chances of expanding economy.

S/S.I. Best export prospects are large capital goods – which take longest to come forward.

Imports reflect industrial re-equipment, which is good. But some forestalling, wh. may cause imports to continue to rise. Must try to discourage.

M.L. Latest figures (this week) will show tight posn. – but not as tight as feared. School leaver posn. in hand.

S/S.E. Useful to have detailed costing of Labour‟s proposals.

Ch.Sec. In hand: and shd. be ready in time.

M.P.B.W. Constrn. industries: Output well up over last year: and stocks of materials improving.

Ch.Exch. Prodn. index misleading: seasonal correctives v. difficult. Therefore emphasise expansion of prodn. of defined items.

M/S.E.S. And emphasise contribn. of more trained man power.

M.P.B.W. And increase in number of houses under constrn. between ‟59 election and now.

M.Lab. And need to eliminate restrictive practices – on both sides.

M.H. Be careful it is not used against us.

M.Lab. Not if tied in with retraining, management training etc.

Ch.Exch. Use NEDC as way into this – i.e. partnerships not compulsion – by means of individual industry studies.

M.W.P.(D) Beware of immediate practical examples – docks, G.P.O. BOAC, „Sunday Telegraph‟. Last is particularly glaring example.

P.M. Ch.Exch. &amp; M.W.P.(D) shd. concert statement on economic sitn., especially on production. Circulate to Cab.

F.S. Yes – but watch end/month figures.

5. BOAC. (Oral)

P.M. V. generous severance terms – repercussions on NCB and BR.

Have therefore proposed 3 partite confrontation at chairman level.

Ch.Exch. Proposals are really designed to circumvent bad labour relations!

Ridiculous in case of Engineers who can get new job without difficulty. May have to insist on agt. with unions i.e. proper redundancy scheme.

P.M. Will keep under close review. Watch comparison with a) Service &amp; Civil Service redundancies b) other industries, especially miners and railwaymen, Unions are same!

6. Northern Rhodesia: Chartered Company. (oral)

L.Ch. Talks with Wina v. difficult. He presses us to extinguish rights, wh. we created. If we won‟t, they will – after indepce. A Max Stamp Opinion supports them. But Co. have obtained contrary opinion: and earlier rulings by Law Officers endorse this. Therefore right course to litigate – but they refuse this. Therefore deadlock on legal issues.

I therefore explored posn. of agreeing on a figure before indepce. But they refuse to discuss with Co. lest they prejudice posn. I suggested we &amp; they shd. discuss with Co, on “without prejudice” basis.

They will consider: but may refuse &amp; renew threat to expropriate without compensn. after indepce. Cd. we offer to discuss with Co. on behalf of N. Rh. Govt.? Distasteful: but perhaps necy. But who will pay the money?

Note rights of copper companies to extract depend on validity of Co‟s titles. Compensn. level might be £150., wh. might be lent them by Sino-Sov. bloc.

?Do we discuss with Co. on behalf of N. Rh. Govt.? Or renew pressure to litigate.?

P.M. Shd. we lend them the money to pay?

Ch.Exch. A bad precedent: and anyway they will have the royalties.

Cd. World Banker – who are against expropn.- lend a hand?

Parly Sec. We might not win in litigation. To say we can‟t challenge Co.‟s

C.R.O. claim is not same as saying we cd prove that claim.

Strong political pressure on the point in N. Rh.: and they see no need to litigate.

Post - indepce. aid not yet settled. ?Shd. we use it as a means of getting this problem out of way?

Ch.Exch. N. Rh. ought to make some compensn. provision.

Parly Sec. They offer £3m.: but derisory.

C.R.O.

Ch.Exch. I have no sympathy with Co.!

L.Ch. Yes: but it mustn‟t be derisory.

Ch.Sec. If it is to be modest, they mustn‟t think we will supplement it.

L.Ch. I agree. If we act as intermediary, this must be clear.

But watch copper companies.

Parly Sec. Wd. be protected if compensn. provision remains in constn.

C.R.O. We must insist on this – even if concede Ch. Co. a separate case.

L.Ch. I will try to find out what Co. wd. settle for. And warn them of dangers to credit – World Bank etc. Will consult colleagues on result.

P.M. And Ch. Exch. to alert W. Bank. [Exit Parly Sec. C.R.O.

7. School Building Survey. (oral)

L.P. Has leaked. About half of school children have modern accn. Survey therefore emphasised deficiencies for other half. Colleagues refused to publish in Feb. – rightly since questions produced misleading picture. Therefore re-written as a W.P. Even this was misleading: and we decided to defer publicn., accepting risk. The risk has now come home to roost.

I shall stick to earlier line – I will publish when document is in a form which I can endorse.

P.M. Let me see wording, before M/S. E.S.‟s speech on Thursday.

M/S. E.S. Watch independent N.U.J. survey. Take credit for our new building (wh. Callaghan has accepted as maximum) wh. we undertook as result of N.U.J. survey.

M.H.L.G. And go over to offensive – on basis of our record.

P.M. Must still defend non - publicn.. Emphasise misleading nature of unprocessed statistics.

L.P.S. And emphasise out of date.

M.W.P.(D) Emphasise report not yet in a physical state ready for publicn.

M.H. But admit some bad conditions remain – so lead on to our plans wh. Calln. has accepted as maximum we can safety undertake.

NOTE: The General Election took place on Thursday 15 October, 1964.

It resulted in a Labour majority; and on Friday, 16 October, 1964

Sir Alec Douglas-Home tendered his resignation and Mr. Harold Wilson accepted The Queen’s commission to form a new Administration.
