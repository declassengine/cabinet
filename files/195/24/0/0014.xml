C.M.(64)34 2 July 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

H.S. Statement today about Challenor case. Some form of enquiry essential – only about Challenor‟s suitability for empt. or corruption in police force alone. Further considn. of this choice: appoint Ch. C. for this purpose, and to advise on criml. charges.

L.Ch. If concede public enquiry, must have wide scope. Altve. is criminal proceedings – wh. will bring facts out. Better to say simply considering criminal proceedings: only if not must consider same enquiry.

H.S. Accept: but can‟t avoid possy. of public enquiry, at least into C.‟s suitability for empt., under recent new powers. Meanwhile, I shall commission a Chief Constable to enquire and help me to decide.

L.Ch. A. Ch. C. provocative?

H.S. But that is what new Act envisages!

L.P.S. At least confine him to form and scope of public enquiry – since one will certainly have to be conceded.

H.S. Must have advice on a) whether criminal charge possible.

b) if not, what form of public enquiry.

Ch.C. essential for both.

L.Ch. Then he must be supported by indept. assessor. ? Edwin Herbert or a Recorder.

L.P. Altvely. send material to D.P.P. for a). That wd. be normal first stage.

That wd. suffice for today‟s statement.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Congo

F.S. Tshombe back. May be asked to form a Govt.: Adoula in the wings meanwhile.

b) Cyprus

P.M. Irwin‟s visit depressing. Turks contemplate only double Enosis. This means either agt. of Gks. (improbable) or invasion. But will send repve. to Geneva to talk to mediator – with Acheson &amp; P. Reilly.

Meanwhile Gk. forces in C. are stronger &amp; may be contemplating new coup. Turks blame us for restraining them.

c) MLF

P.M. We have put in altve. proposals for study – m/manning of aircraft etc.

Have asked U.S. not to press until after Oct. Meanwhile maintain attitude of impartial review of altve. ways of m/manning.

d) Malta

C.S. Negotns. broken down on status of church, wh. accepts changes in constn.: but these are rejected by B.O.

S/S.D. Refm. was on basis of privileged status. If B.O. (consistently) breaks on this issue, good for us.

But, if he compromises, acute defence points will arise.

Better to break &amp; avoid these points.

C.S. Not at cost of breach with Malta: v. damaging. Must try for compromise: if break, do so on Church, not on nuclear missiles.

P.M. ?Adjourn (not break) on Church, particularly if B.O. at odds with Vatican.

S/S.D. At all costs avoid not breaking on Church &amp; having to break on missiles.

C.S. You must trust me to take account of Cab‟s misgivings.

L.P.S. But majority of M. don‟t want indepce. That gives us grounds for breaking?

P.M. I wd. still prefer adjournment or postponement.

S/S.D. Particularly, since not in B.O.‟s own interest to break on Church but very much in ours.

P.M. Try to get agt.: but, if break on Church (? and destroy B.O.), then adjourn. [Exit C.S.

3. Charges against police (resumed) [Enter A.G.

A.G. D.P.P. not an investigator: therefore prelimy. enquiry necy.

H.S. Police enquiry not sufficient to cover latest charges of corruption. Therefore wider enquiry (Ch. C.) desirable.

L.Ch. If so, add an assessor – ?Swanwick.

A.G. 3 stages: a) why was Ch. allowed to remain on duty. H.C. can deal with this: no case for enquiry.

b) was he corrupt and were convictions wrongfully obtained? If public enquiry on this, prosecn. can‟t follow. Therefore have enquiry to decide whether to

prosecute and to have an enquiry. Initial enquiry not in public.

P.M. Agree. [Exit H.S.

4. U.S. Shipping Legislation. (oral and C.P.(64)130.)

S/S.I. Powers in Bill are permissive &amp; indiscriminate (incl. H. Kong).

Enforcement – criminal procs. or injunction? Former, if to be effective. If proceed, must consult interests concerned. Parly. timetable v. tight.

L.Ch. A bogus Bill. We shan‟t prosecute: and our bluff will be called. U.S. won‟t hesitate to enforce their law because we change ours. And no help at I. Court: Cl. 1. implies that we make same claim as U.S.! Go to I.C. forthwith.

M.T. W‟ton tel. 2387 implies U.S. wd. think again if we legislate.

S/S.I. And U.S. are not merely preserving their own terrl. jurisdiction; they are encroaching on ours, wh. we must protect.

A.G. Even so, Cl. 1 – “any person” – goes too far. German legislation more apt and might be adopted.

S/S.I. No real difference – both are invasive of private rights.

A.G. No: German law more careful (limited to German contracting with somebody outside Germany) and applies objective test.

M.T. But U.S. purport to extend to Br. shipper contracting with Br. ship owner for carriage by Br. ship.

S/S.D. Some legn. needed to satisfy U.S.: but let L. Ch. &amp; A.G. reconsider Cl. 1.

Ch.Whip. 13 or 15 July only possible dates – i.e. next Wed. last day for publicn.

P.M. Then be quick. And bring Law Officers into earlier consultn.

Agree legn. in principle. And consider civil, rather than criminal, sanctions.

L.Ch. And then get issue to I.C. as soon as possible! Proposed enquiry (o.k.) irrelevant. Test by intl. law i.e. I.C.

S/S.I. Do U.S. accept I.C? Have they withdrawn reservation.?

P.M. U.S. can‟t contemplate refce. until after Presl. election.

A.G. U.S. still retain some reservn. about refce. to I.C.

P.M. F.S. to enquire. Meanwhile reconsider Bill: &amp; approve my letter to U.S. Prest.

5. Land Values. C.P.(64)125&amp;127

Ch.Exch. People believe land prices increase house prices: and resent profit on land transactions. Mutually contradictory: reducing profit wd. not reduce house prices! Only answer is release of more land: and even that pointless when bldg. indy. fully loaded.

But a tax on merits? See my memm. Levy on devt. values the only practicable course – justified by exclusive right to scarcity value.

Amount ? 25% wd. have no effect on house prices: more might prevent land coming forward.

Args in favour of action: public concern: justice.

“ against “ reactions of Consve. Party: lateness of action – justifiable only as part of package.

Marginally, I favour action.

M.H.L.G. Can‟t do more to demonstrate folly of Opp.‟s. policy without some action of our own.

L.Ch. Declared interest. Favour devt. charge in principle: but it will not affect prices. And assessment of existing use value arbitrary. May stultify urban redevelopment.

Ch.Duchy. Beware of deathbed repentance – especially since no effect on house prices, and real unease of conscience is about easy profit alone.

But do it early in new Parlt.

S/S.D. Capital gains tax better. But v. contentious: and wrong to introduce it now, while admitting that has no effect on house prices – i.e. can be defended only on tax grounds, not on housing grounds.

Ch.Exch. Cap. gains for land rather difficult: exclusive right to exploit scarcity value.

L.P. Can‟t distinguish from devt. charge, wh. we have abolished!

F.S. Party take this view. Therefore, whatever moral posn. may be, politically unwise at this moment.

M.W.P.(C) Declared interest. V. embarrassing to make so much profit out of planning permission. I favour tax.

M.H.L.G. I agree. No political difficulty. We had to dismantle Labour system, wh. had frozen land supply: but now justified in acting – we won‟t lose support, (tho‟ may expose us to teasing).

Ch.Sec. Minimise risk by tying to M.H.L.G.‟s announcement of more land being made available – wh. will increase private profit &amp; therefore justifies some degree of levy. But avoid creating impressing of cap. gains tax.

M.H. I oppose this and favour full blown c.g.t. But not at this moment.

L.Ch. Watch exceptions – especially “compulsory” sales for estate duty.

M/S.E&amp;S Case for action v. strong – if only because of stimulus wh. we have given to public investt. and need for more revenue to balance increased Govt. Expre. Can‟t remain impassive.

M.T. I support L.Ch. V. difficult in detailed applicn. And what about compensn. to match betterment.

M.H.L.G. Not a real difficulty.

S/S.S. Devt. is one thing: all land transactions v. different. Don‟t push up price of land (in anticipn. of tax on sale) for normal agrl. or investt. purposes.

P.M. If a taxn. question, for Budget. ? Refer to it as a possibility then.

H.S. No – v. dangerous.

L.P.S. Agree: wd. split the Party.

P.M. Can‟t introduce new tax after Finance Bill. But -? hint in Manifesto that, if suitable charge can be developed ……

Ch.Exch. Not quite a tax: and not really a Budget matter.

M.H.L.G. And essential to find some means of soothing sense of outrage while not discouraging land from coming forward.

Ch.Exch. I will consult F.S., M.H.L.G. &amp; Ch. Duchy about what (if anything) Manifesto might say in light of this discussion. It must be a defensive statement, while leaving door open. [Exit L.P.

6. Party Political Broadcasting. C.P.(64)122 [Enter P.M.G.

L.P.S. As in memm. 5 minutes is immaterial: and we stand for minorities.

L.Ch. Even Communists?

P.M. And Sc. Nationalists – who do detract from our support.

Better to stick at 50 &amp; say review next time.

L.P.S. But Labour Party (who severely favour no change) are supporting 30 in order to try to put blame on us.

P.M. ?Consult Law Officers.

Ch.Whip. They say no action cd. arise.

P.M. Then stick to 50.

L.P.S. But 30 wd. be v. helpful in Wales.

S/S.D. It won‟t win any seats even there!

Ch.Sec. They may have time on Carthie.

P.M. Stand on 50 and put it on BBC!

7. Televising State Opening of Parliament. C.P.(64)120

L.P.S. As in memm. [Enter Parly Sec., M.P.B.W.

P.M. Agree: discuss through usual channels. Parallel colour film as before.

[Re-enter A.G.

8. Charges against the Police (resumed)

H.S. Dual enquiry won‟t work. But enquiry under new Act essential. Therefore announce today. Ch. C. enquiry was to consider new charges – wh. Ch. C. can‟t do. (Risk of breach of Judges‟ Rules, if people questioned). Therefore say enquiry in Aug. about adequacy of precautions to prevent such man from acting.

Ch. C., in interval, cd. advise me whether scope shd. be widened and whether ct. proceedings grounds can be established to satisfaction of D.P.P.

A.G. Prelimy. enquiry strictly unnecessary. But don‟t contest.

L.Ch. Make clear that, if evidence in support of new charges, will be referred to D.P.P. But avoid refce. to Ch. C.

H.S. But it is what new Act prescribes.

L.Ch. Not necy. by a Ch. C.

H.S. But it will leak. Better to admit.

P.M. V. well – but as unobtrusively as possible.

9. Amendment of the Canadian Constitution. C.P.(64)126

Approved.
