C.C.(64)9 19 November 1964. 10.30 a.m.

[Enter Ch.Whip

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P. As in statement.

2. N.I. benefits. (oral)

P.M. Continuing pressure for acceleration. Let M.P.N.I. call in outside expert on computers to see if computer could help. M. Techy. to be associated.

Ch.Duchy. Acceleration administratively difficult: and large financial implications.

P.M. M.P.N.I. to bring to Cab. on Tuesday (before debate on Bill on Wedy.).

Ch. Exch. On cost, I opposed 12/6 in first place. It involves extra £60m. already.

Also, some benefits (disability) already given accelerated dates. This, too, I have conceded. Similarly widows‟ earning‟s rule accelerated.

If we advance main date, must advance date for contribns. also.

Backdating of benefits wd. cost Fund &amp; Exchequer £25m. a month: contribns., if accelerated, wd. account for £16m. I can‟t face Exchequer balance. Must emphasise that we have given larger increase than since 1948.

P.M. As I said – on basis of simultaneous increase of contribns.. If change possible ? announce after P.Q.‟s on Tuesday.

Consider also whether “Xmas bonus” already conceded on N.A. cd. be extended to N.I.

3. Oversea Affairs. (oral) [Enter M/S. F.O.

a) U.N.

M/S. F.O. Risk of serious trouble on Art 19. S.U. still v. rigid. We must be firm on principle, but flexible on operation.

b) Congo

M/S. F.O. Tshombe‟s forces still advancing on Stanleyville. 26 Br. subjects there: also U.S. and Belgian citizens. Latter arranging paratroop rescue operation.

We have conceded use of Ascension Island: also arranging evacn. of Br. subjects.

P.M. Mustn‟t appear to side with Tshombe: or provoke retaln. against hostages. But still …. ?

S/S.D. U.S. only providing aircraft: Belgium the paratroopers: we Ascension.

But operation may not be feasible at all.

Col.Sec. Repercussions in Africa cd. be serious: and identificn. with Belgium

bad for our colonial image. Therefore hope opn. can be avoided.

P.M. But we can‟t let 26 Br. subjects be killed. Red Cross intervention?

M/S. F.O. Intl. Red Cross not able to prevent a massacre. And our 26 include women &amp; children.

P.M. Keep me in touch.

4. European Free Trade Association. (oral) [Enter M/S. B/T.

Ch.Exch. EFTA fury gradually declining – at least as regards Govt., if not traders. But must help so far as we can. Examn. of proposals has rejected date for termination of 15% charge; avoid acceleration of removal of EFTA tariffs – leave other members to settle; reject EFTA Fund (financed by our surcharge!) since only Danes really favour.

There remains undertaking to consult before change in surcharge; promise to establish economic committee: take credit for advance information to EFTA of industrial exceptions list for K. Round and similar procedure for agricl. list.

P.M. Take note. [Exeunt M/S. F.O. : and M/S. B/T.

5. Docks. C.(64)15) [Enter M.O.D.

M.Lab. Devlin has recommended 5% on piece work rate (as asked) and 19/2d. on time rate (as against 20/- asked). Strike unlikely. But it means a 4% increase p.a. Shd. help to implement D.‟s main proposals for de-casualisation.

H.S. Possibilities for action (C.(64)15) must not prejudice negotns.. See para 6 – no troops cd. cope if escalation on wide scale. Subject to this warning, see timetable of action – use of troops wd. become known 6 days before they began. Food shortage wd. not begin for 3 weeks: therefore time before initial consultns. need begin. On this basis can I have discretion to consult S/S.D. about this, as in sub-para (c).

P.M. Agree no action yet: might prejudice remaining stages of negotn. Therefore report again on Tuesday.

?Will Devlin Part 2 deal with damage to exports from bottlenecks in docks?

E.D.S. shd. at least consider whether any Govt. action required here.

Ch.Exch. I agree: greater dispersal of port usage v. desirable.

M.Techy. Storage facilities at ports also important.

P.M. I will send minute to First Secy.: then E.D.C.: then consider whether outside enquiry.

6. Railway &amp; Bus Disputes. (oral)

M.Lab. Rail go slow ceased, pending further discussions.

Nothing on buses at present.

7. Legislative Programme. C.(64)16 [Enter Att.Gen.

L.P. Programme wd. do for two sessions! May have a little time upstairs – and cut recesses (a little)? Sit till 23 Dec.: and resume on 15, rather than 22 Jan. if Bill‟s ready. Also curtail Whitsun recess a bit. Also carry Session into November. But, if further, a mere device to appear to get all Bills in first Session.

May save on contingent Bills – but only 6 days at max.

All Bills in B1 &amp; 2 ought to be done in first Session, if possible.

But, if so, Rent Control, Law Cm. &amp; I. &amp; S. must be ready by third week in Feb. Monopolies may be an inevitable casualty – or others in B1 &amp; 2 may have to suffer. And children‟s services in London (can‟t decide till next week) may be another complication.

M.O.D. C.D.W. &amp; O‟seas Aid are small &amp; non-controversial. Must give colonies usual advance notice of C.D.W. funds to be provided. Current authority expires in 1966: advance notice must be given by summit of 1965. Hence enabling Bill shd. be included or Ch. Exch. must be willing to commit himself specifically before legn. O. Aid Bill equally vital if we are to maintain momentum, particularly as regards recruitment of staff, which may otherwise actually fall.

L.P. A typical case! No commitment: but consider combining in one Bill and put to Legn. Cttee. without prejudice.

H.S. Backing of Warrants urgent.

L.P. Might be done by P. Members‟ Bill. Also Criminal Evidence.

M.H.L.G. Slum Clearance Compensn. as urgent as Children‟s Services will be.

Ch.Whip. May be managed. (“Peter Show”.)

M.Power. May be ready on I. and S. by mid-Feb.

M.H.L.G. Rents by end Jan.

P.M. Keep them absolutely in step throughout. (And timetable both in one Motion!)

M.H.L.G. But put Land Commn. in first? It will be ready, whereas Rents must wait for M. -Holland.

P.M. And put Bills in June or July, even if no possibility of enactment.

L.P. And ? use device of carrying P. Members‟ Bills to future session by Resn. of House.
