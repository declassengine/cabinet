C.M.(64)27 12 May 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement? Reassemble on 1 June if necy. for R.P.M.

M.W.P.(D) ?Answer Oppn. policy on early school.

M/S. Edn. Anticipates (Lady) Plowden‟s Cttee.

Also wd. only help about ¼ or 1/5 of problem in terms of teachers required. Full measure of Robbins expansion in 60‟s already in hand; teacher training going faster than any other part of Edn. programme.

Unwelcome to mothers in employment.

Many teachers might prefer 6 to 5½!

P.M. Adopt critical attitude.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral) [Enter S.S. War : Joint Parly U/S C.R.O. &amp; C.O.

a) Cyprus

M.W.P.(C) Gk. P.M. says must continue to press for unitary State: but fearful of Comm influence – therefore enosis and NATO notificn: (i.e. NATO to pay).

Must wait for mediator‟s report: but a possible starter.

P.M. Wait for F.S. to report.

b) Aden

P.M. See SOSLON 53. Accept: but must consider substance carefully.

Await C.S.‟s return.

See SOSLON 52: infiltrators can be dealt with only by air proscription, wh. will discourage tribes from harbouring dissidents.

L.P. Women and children, being indistinguishable from men, will be killed.

Parly Sec. Avoid humans: confine to crops and livestock.

C.R.O.

M.W.P.(C) Agree. Otherwise more trouble in U.N.

P.M. Equally liable to U.N. attack if war drags on! Must stop infiltrators.

M.H. Even livestock risks women and children, who act as shepherds etc.

Ch.Sec. I endorse C.S.‟s proposal: he is on the spot.

Ch.Exch. No: indiscriminate intimidation v. dangerous.

M.W.P.(C) Not if confined to flocks and crops.

P.M. Concentrations of tribesmen intent on reinforcing Radfan must be dispersed. But air proscription must be limited to flocks and crops. Attacks on humans must be deferred until C.S. returns.

M.W.P.(D) Watch publicity. ?Announce intentions to Press on spot.

L.Ch. Leaflets demanding return to obedience shd. also require surrender of weapons, to make clear that rebels have got weapons.

P.M. Yes. And formed bodies of troops are legitimate target.

M.W.P.(C) Yemenis have now approached us in U.N. Must consider this – tho‟ may wither if they also arraign us before Secy. C. or Cttee. of 24.

P.M. Await C.S.‟s return: meanwhile give limited authority as I proposed – i.e. tribesmen going to reinforce rebels; crops: livestock: but no risk of shooting women and children. Certainly retaliate against men who shoot at our aircraft from ground.

I will circulate a tel. to Cab. [Exit Parly Sec. C.O.

3. Investment Programme. C.P.(64)84,87,96,97,98,99,100,101 [and 31]

Ch.Sec. £21m. of redns. therefore increase now agreed. But ‟65-66 prospect v. serious. Therefore either orderly redn. or overheated economy.

Remaining problems: housing, univs. and defence.

Housing. M.H.L.G. wants 125,000: we want 116,000. Unit cost £1800 in 1960, has risen to £3000 (public sector house). Cd. we therefore compromise on challenge to more expensive projects wh. might achieve both economy and a slowing down in rate of starts.

In Scotland, housing has risen sharply by £18m. No effective authorisation procedure: but S.S.H.A. offer some scope.

Univs. Compromise on extra £15m. in 1965 and £6m. in 1966 – i.e. £21m. in 5 quarters as compared with U.G.C‟s proposal of £25m. in 4 quarters. Justified by Robbins, provided not sabotage of restriction in other sectors.

Defence. 17% increase over current figure proposed. Civil programmes, on basis I have proposed, will rise by about 5%. Hence my proposal for redn. of £4½ m.

No cancellation of publicly announced programmes. But essential.

L.P. U.G.C. wd. prob. acquiesce tho‟ disclaiming responsibility. Therefore I won‟t press for more: it may suffice, particularly if efficiency in bldg. methods can be expedited.

H.S. Agree: gives £54½m. over 5 quarters as distinct from £58½m. wh. U.G.C. want. They ought to be able to manage. Robbins figure was 192,000: reduce for foreign students and C.H.‟s and this brings it down

to 170,000.

Formally, therefore, our pledge is safe.

M.H.L.G. I am using admve. delay as much as I can. Margin between 120,000 and 125,000 solely for priority area: and cost checks are already elaborate. Even so, I can‟t hold below 125,000. Completion dates not lengthening; and no real shortage of labour in priority areas.

Private sector won‟t continue to accelerate at present pace.

M.P.B.W. Can‟t let private sector rise and restrict public sector.

Some L.A.‟s good about consortia, methods etc. Others not. Therefore put emphasis on cost efficiency directed to saving labour. Govt. has created Devt. Agency etc.: and univs. and L.A.‟s must co-operate.

M.H.L.B. Rise in costs due to rising land and standard costs as well as labour costs. 60,000 approved but not yet started. If approvals limited, L.A.‟s will simply start more. Cd. restrict starts next year.

Ch.Sec. Not a reason for approving more. A reason for approving less!

M.P.B.W. Must not undermine confidence in construction industries. Bottleneck parties will be productive if no cut in programme. Therefore give impression L.A.‟s and univs not co-operating with N.B.A. – not that we are holding back ourselves.

M.Lab. Labour shortage now serious in south. This will itself limit starts in private sector.

M.H.L.G. If keep to 120,000 public announcement unavoidable. But I will do my best, with M.P.B.W. and “Sand”, to keep below 125,000. Otherwise savage cut in non priority areas unavoidable. (30% below this year.)

S/S.P. Margin of error in calcn. is greater than margin at issue. Therefore leave alone and put effort into modernisation of industries.

Ch.Duchy. I agree: no overt action!

M.H. Real increase of £77m. reflects no real increase in health – because long term programme agreed with Tsy. All I want is that this programme shd. be maintained – not cut by £2¾ m.

Even so 10 yr. programme will take 14 yrs. or so (20 yrs. in one case) to complete. A cut, wh. wd. have to be publicised, cd. not be defended – least of all if other sectors not to be cut.

H.S. Same true of H.O. – new courts, new policy and Prison bldg. etc.

Ch.Exch. New bids keep outstripping proposed cuts! This aggravates B/P problem and therefore impedes long term growth programme. Can‟t

rely on intl. borrowing unless put own house in order.

Ch.Sec. All long term programmes (incl. health) are subject to annual reconsideration. Can‟t proceed otherwise.

P.M. ?Delay office bldg.

M.P.B.W. No control – except over Govt. offices, wh. are too small to matter.

Ch.Exch. And I will try to slow down natd. industries.

S/S.I. That risks leakage – v. damaging politically, since less than 1% of bldg. industry at stake.

Ch. Exch I disagree.

M.P. Power natd. industries will co-operate.

M.P.B.W. But they must be pressed – like L.A.‟s services to adopt economic methods.

M.W.P.(D) I agree.

Ch.Exch. Everybody knows economy over loaded.

M.P.B.W. No – not if methods are changed. [Exit L.P.

Ch.Exch. If others will play might concede hospitals to health (but not health and welfare). But can‟t drift into financial crisis next year.

M.P.B.W. Put emphasis on positive presentation – modern methods etc.

Operate against high tender prices etc.

H.S. I will take my cuts: but no public action!

P.M. Leave health alone: rely on max. saved from housing. [Exit Ch.Sec.

S/S.S. Fortnight‟s delay in E. &amp; W. is 2½ months in S. – cut of 6,000 starts out of total programme of 321,000 houses. Public announcement is unavoidable. No boom in private sector: therefore cut wd. fall wholly on L.A. housing. i.e. slums and twilights.

Costs have risen by 11%, as a result of redevt. of city centres.

This will be offset by new methods, wh. depend on confidence and therefore on no cuts. But public sector housing concentrated in growth areas.

Ch.Exch. I sympathise – particularly because space capacity in Scotland.

P.M. I will discuss with small group how to handle on M.P.B.W.‟s lines.

Bring S/S. Defence into it.

Meanwhile leave Health alone; let M.H.L.G. do his best. Avoid any impression that a “cut” exercise is on.

Announce univ. settlement this week – written P.Q.

[Exit S/S. War.

4. The Kennedy Round. (oral) [Enter Parly. Sec. C.R.O. C.O.

S/S.I. Inauguration of K.R. in Geneva last week. Unnecessary meeting given difficulties of agrl. policy etc. U.S. foolishly pressed Six on this, and on 50% linear cut. Fr. walked out of meeting of Six to discuss this and substituted a “working hypothesis of 50%” instead of “on basis of 50%”. Rest of us accepted: and U.S. came into line. Six want negotn. across the board, since suspicious of U.S. on exception lists and non tariff barriers. But U.S. won‟t publish exception lists before Election – but everybody now committed to 10 Sept. U.S. will have to evade this at later stage. Negotns. can‟t therefore begin till early ‟65: meantime non tariff barriers and agrl. can be discussed.

Result: Fr. have got their revenge and re-established unity of E.E.C. under their ascendancy – even tho‟ may wish to help us and U.S.

Therefore we shd. adopt 3rd Power posn. siding with U.S. or Six as suits us.

[Exit L.Ch, MWP(C)

On UNCTAD, only contributed informally in various respects. C„wealth countries pleased: and sensible proposals now tabled. Confce. to close in second week of June.
