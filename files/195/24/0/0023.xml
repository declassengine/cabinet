C.M.(64)43 29 July 1964. 11 a.m.

1. Lang Report on Ferranti contracts. (oral)

[Enter M. Avn.

Discussion of Oppn. Motion and amendments.

M. Avn. Report indicates 3 Deptl. errors:

a) miscaln. of direct labour costs.

b) no check of actual costs during mftre. against technical costs etc.

c) no comparison of accts „o‟ heads against t.c. est. of direct

labour costs.

Enquiry by Perm. Sec. being instituted to ascertain how these happened: whether case for disciply. action.

We have recently brought accts. &amp; t. costers together – after their separation in 1946.

Procedures &amp; standard clauses being reviewed.

Other F. contracts being reviewed: average profit of 20-30%.

Considering whether outside experts might be used.

New forms of incentive contracts being considered.

Adequacy of Depts. staff – and quality of technical staffs – being considered: but may be insoluble at present rates of pay.

S/S. E.S. Admve. control of technical staffs inadequate. Decisions left to too low a level.

M.Avn. T.C. officers have no direct link with either admve. staff or technical advisers on specifications etc.

C.S. This is one of v. few contracts wh. have turned out cheaper than was thought. Some “margin” by F. not unreasonable.

L.Ch. Criticism is not of original estimating but of failure to check costs during progress.

M.T. Necy. to decide who is in charge of estimating &amp; price fixing. He must be technically competent for job. You won‟t get him at current rates of pay. M.T. are going to be own consulting engineers for small part of work – hiring best outside advice.

L.Ch. And, while avoiding cost plus, must devise more elastic form of contract.? Appoint cttee, with outsiders, to consider this.

Ch.Exch. Must wait for second Lang report.

M.P.B.W. What is needed is a project manager.

M.Avn. Don‟t shake morale too much. Wait for Lang II and meanwhile emphasise steps already being taken.

L.Ch. And don‟t underrate F‟s own culpability.

P.M. For debate, as M. Avn.

On leak, nothing in V.C.10 story. On F. two figures quoted by Press can have come only from Ferranti.

L.Ch. Must resist an enquiry. No. O.S. Act aspect: therefore challenge F. personally.

M.W.P.(D) Distinguish between leaks &amp; enterprising journalism.

L.Ch. Even if V.C.10 merely a rehash of other papers, they got it somehow – i.e. a leak further back. Probably B.O.A.C.!

P.M. Reject enquiry, since satisfied no leak from Govt. Dept.

2. B.O.A.C. Services to S. America. (oral)

M.W.P.(C) Commercial interests v. concerned to maintain service. Hence F.S.‟s proposal, subject to two conditions.

Service restarted in 1961: can‟t discontinue now.

C.S. Endorse.

Ch.Exch. Br. Eagle say cd. operate route, with V.C.10‟s, at lower cost than B.O.A.C.

They wd. like to study this and make a definite proposal.

M.T. Don‟t subsidise B.O.A.C. We rejected £300,000 a year subsidy for Reina del Mar. Other ships of Royal Mail also in difficulty on this service. Great shipping resentment if we subsidise B.O.A.C.

H.S. But mustn‟t contract out of S.A. in favour of France, Germany etc.

Ch.Sec. But we have just given £7m. to Inter-American Bank.

M.Avn. B.O.A.C. have rights in S.A. Br. Eagle haven‟t. And B.E. not strong financially. Change of aircraft wd. also have to be negotiated.

Therefore let B.O.A.C. carry on for a year, with necy. subsidy: and meanwhile consider B. Eagle &amp; other possibilities.

S/S.I. B.O.A.C. service has only limited prestige value.

Ch.Exch. They shd. carry on without subsidy for a few months, while we consider, on basis of subsidy if we want them to continue thereafter.

Ch.Sec. Or undertake to take several months opn. into account in final settlement. That is not a specific subsidy: and shd. not offend R. Mail.

P.M. Agree. B.O.A.C. shdn‟t have tried to force our hands by announcing

service to be discontinued. Therefore say hope they will carry on while details of finl. settlement are being worked out. If this entails a year‟s subsidy, can‟t help that. It will keep posn. open for Eagle.

M.Avn. I will try. [Exit M.Avn.

3. Jenkins Report on Company Law. C.P.(64)156

S/S.I. E.P.C. agreed my draft W.P. except on:-

a) degree of exemption. Highlighted by Bloom affair. But will frighten many small companies. Posn. of shipping companies‟ reserves also delicate. Even so, can‟t say merely considering these points. Written P.Q. exposes less flank on them than a W.P.

b) But refce. to “more informn.” can be used in relation to subscripns. to political funds. Here, too, a written P.Q. at end of Parlt. better than a W.P.

L.Ch. Non sequitur in second sentence of para 2. No impact on industrial efficiency. Therefore delete refce. to Govt‟s objective.

Last para – “now intend” – provokes question why not before now?

P.M. Substitute “evidence” for “industrial”.

Remove ambiguity in “responsibility”

Reconsider phrasing of “companies in other companies”.

Amend last para – “Before legn. finally drafted, Govt. intend to enter into …” or “continue”.
