C.C.(64)6 5 November 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P. As in statement. Suppy. Budget on Wednesday.

2. Oversea Affairs. (oral)

a) U.S.A.

F.S. Rusk told me that, if Johnson won, he would get tougher with e.g. de Gaulle, Soekarno, etc. Wants first of his series of meetings with other Govts. to be with us.

de G.‟s threat to abandon or freeze EEC &amp; N.A.T.O. may be serious. His real concern is with M.L.F. rather than agricl. policy. We are doing some contingency planning against break up of EEC etc.: if a freeze, all we can do is to prop up EFTA, whose morale is low.

b) Cambodia

F.S. India &amp; Russia pressing for 14-Power confce. to restore neutrality.

But frontier in dispute: I have told Soldatov we can‟t intervene till frontier settled, and that, since we are co chairman, confce can‟t be summoned till we agree. Looks as though S.U. accepts this and have abandoned attempts to wreck joint chairmanship.

c) Sudan

F.S. Upheaval result of (permanent) factor of division between Arab north and Negro south and (ephemeral) factor of dislike of military regime.

New Govt. is civilian but includes 4 Communists. Must watch our overflying rights.

3. Commonwealth Immigration. C.(64)11

H.S. As in memm. Is tone of statement right? I want to review possibilities of humanising control – particularly as regards dependants and sickness. Must do this before can be ready for discussion: and dangerous to invite proposals.

C.S. Agree on last point.

P.M. C‟w Imn. Cttee. shd. agree form of words on policy for debate, emphasising positive side of absorbing immigrants. Include Eric Williams‟ proposal.

F.S. Control shd. be related to visa free travel facilities. ?Can we limit it to C‟wealth citizens rather than citizens of U.K. &amp; colonies.

S/S.W. But what about W. Indies?

F.S. I want control limited to indept. C‟w. countries. Colonies wd. be free.

Col.Sec. Not much risk of flood of colonial immigrants.

P.M. Cttee. shd. examine. M.O.D. to be associated with Cttee. – especially on Eric Williams‟ proposals.

M.H.L.G. Delete “in the large cities”. Contrary to policy.

P.M. Agree: approve despatch to C‟wealth Govts.
