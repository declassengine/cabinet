C.M.(64)39 17 July 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Lamp Standards in Westminster Area. C.P.(64)129

[Enter Parly Sec. M.T.

M.P.B.W. Cost of stopping wd. now be £10,000. Safety shd. prevail.

M.W.P.(D) F.O. standard – Grey &amp; all that.

M.P.B.W. Doubtfully authentic. But, if you like …..

S/S.D. No – treat as a whole. Aesthetic considn. shd. prevail.

M.P.B.W. No public feeling – except on safety. ?Put up new and leave old.

M.W.P.(C) I support S/S.D.

L.Ch. So do I. B‟cage Walk can‟t now be stopped. But no more.

P.M. Yes – &amp; keep existing standards in B‟c Walk as well as new ones.

Leave others for a time. [Exit Party Sec. M.T.

2. Stationing Costs in Germany. (oral)

Ch.Sec. Before P.M. cd. make proposed move to break deadlock, Germans proposed indication, outside adjustment, that in spite of best endeavours, £30m. wd. be the limit. Also made difficulties about Thorneycroft v Hassall formula. Can‟t accept this?. If not, must revive concept of P.M. approach.

Original agt. - £53½m. (against £70m.) each year for 2 years. Now £32 (£85). Therefore must try to get proposed letter withdrawn and formula accepted or try to get better figures. If so, what figure? Our original £40m. p.a.

M.W.P.(C) Wd. like agreement – but not at too low a figure. [Enter Ch.Exch.

M.L. Does imminence of Goldwater enable us to be tougher?

M.W.P.(C) More likely to help Adenauer and Strauss against Chancellor and Schroder.

S/S.D. Agt. unlikely before our election. And figure can‟t be kept secret.

Is my formula a face saver?

P.M. Even £40m. is a bad figure presentationally. Therefore avoid figures: settle for formula and withdrawal of letter. If Germans insist on a figure, must be higher than £40m. Beware of threats to withdraw troops (before election) since, if we get agt., we are tied to keeping them there.

3. V.C.10 (oral – resumed)

[Enter M.Avn. : M/D.RAF : Parly Sec. : M.T.

M.Avn. Pressures mounting: Party Cttee. want no cancelln.: Guthrie wants at least 10. He now says will want more than 40 aircraft at end of decade. If 5, this wd. reduce differential. Therefore go ahead as I proposed.

Ch.Sec. It is irrelevant. Calcns. beyond 1968 are uncertain; and we must settle now on basis of what Guthrie has said he wants. On any view, too many V.C.10‟s are on order: and we must think in terms of a £30m. differential. Unwise, financially &amp; politically, to swallow this.

P.M. I agree. Must compromise. But present more positively than in L.P.S‟s draft (circulated).

S/S.D. Even so. BOAC can‟t know requirement in „70‟s yet.

And mixed fleet commercially indefensible. Wholesale cancellation (impossible) or all V.C.10 fleet wd. be better.

BOAC will buy most aircraft: and we are not allowing for this.

Ch.Sec. But can‟t commit themselves now to type to be used in „70‟s.

P.M. How far are we doing this by compromise? We are at least giving them a broad hint to “want British” in „70‟s.

Ch.Exch. But at least give BOAC six months in which to think – and ourselves a chance to get over election before considering the adjustment of resources wh. we shall have to make afterwards in any event.

S/S.D. Even so, compromise will satisfy nobody.

P.M. And, since BOAC really want to buy Boeings, a straight cut might be better. If compromise, must pursue as means of preventing cancellation until BOAC are clear about requirement.

M.A.F.F. But implicit that, if they do want 10 more, they will be V.C.10‟s.

Ch.Exch. And by then they may want new Boeings, wh. can reach Sydney in one hop.

M/D. RAF And six months is too short a period to decide. [Exit H.S.

S/S.I. Yes: we are imposing limitns. on free commercial opn. of a world wide airline for sake of our aircraft industry.

M.P.B.W. Best to decide now in favour of all British fleet. But postponement better based on specifications for aircraft of ‟70‟s rather than on numbers required.

M.Avn. Might persuade BAC to give longer period than six months, with no increase in cancelln charges.

Ch.Whip. Cd. sell the compromise to Party.

M.Avn. But BOAC also must back our decision publicly.

P.M. He must be seen and fixed in advance.

M.W.P.(D) And must avoid damaging disclosures over weekend.

M.Avn. If I must see Guthrie and Edwards, not much time if I leave it till Monday.

Ch.Exch. Not unreasonable, for Vickers to say that they must know (?by end of year or June ‟65) what BOAC will want in ‟70‟s.

S/S.I. If you force BOAC to that point, they will cancel. Latest point for decision on requirement is after latest date for Vickers to need to know about cancellation.

P.M. Accept compromise. Amend draft statement to emphasise specifications for ‟70‟s as decisive factor; need for BOAC to have more time to decide: fact that orders have been placed and cancelln. charges (specify) are involved.

M.Avn. Long report on Ferranti affair not good. That means a second rough debate!

P.M. Must consider whether we publish and face debate. But not relevant to V.C.10‟s!

L.Ch., Ch. Sec. &amp; M. Avn. to redraft public statement. Must then clear with Guthrie &amp; Edwards. (Add Ch. Whip &amp; M/D RAF.)

S/S.D. Concord is real answer to basic problem – i.e. an aircraft for several countries.

M.W.P.(C) See C.P.(64)142. Does this affect this decision?

Ch.Exch. No – 2 extra make no difference. But we pay for opn. Of service.

M.Avn. Agree no difference to numbers. They will hold on to two Comets and then replace them by V.C.10‟s.

M.W.P.(C) Politically v. desirable (after D/Ed‟s visit) to remain interested in S.A. Subsidy awkward, since none given to shipping service wh. stopped some months ago. But that cuts both ways – two blows twice as bad as one!

Parly Sec. But we rejected subsidy to Royal Mail for Reina del Mar. on grounds

M.T. that transport shd. not be subsidised. R. del M. withdrawn from W. coast: 3 boats on E. coast are running at a loss. Therefore proposal will revive pressure for subsidy, wh. we shall have no grounds for refusing.

M.W.P.(C) But R. del M. called once in three months: aircraft will call 2 or 3 times a week.

L.Ch. A further departure from principle of BOAC commercial operation. Therefore shd. be charged to F.O. Vote as political subsidy.

S/S.I. Scope for joint operation with another airline? This, combined with more flexible rates, might do the trick.

P.M. Approve? But F.S. must reconsider taking on F.O. Vote. At least Guthrie must keep quiet.

And 3 for RAF also included.

Ch.Sec. No – not yet agreed!

M.Avn. But must be in statement which, without them, will be a nonsense.

Ch.Exch. Put them in long term costings – on basis that we shall take them out.

4. United Nations Conference on Trade &amp; Development.

C.P.(64)138

S/S.I. Prefer Geneva – less political pressure and closer to allied assocs. such as GATT. French, S. Union, India &amp; Pak. wd. support us. Sec.-Gen favours N.Y., for obvious reasons – &amp; we may have to give way.

M.W.P.(C) Decision won‟t rest with us! But might be better for us if in N.Y. where less able to assume an independent life.

P.M. Leave to discretion of S/S.I.

S/S.I. On voting procedures, U.S. want “qualified” majority voting (weighted for popn., trade etc.).

Other countries resist, as threat to “one man, one vote” principle.

U.S. have fallen back on dev. &amp; undev countries in separate blocks, each requiring majority. But this means S.U. in former: and it offends undev countries. We have supported it; but it is a lost cause

Reconsider with U.S. how to shift ground so as to avoid endangering canceln. procedure, wh. is our main interest.

P.M. Agree: avoid dual voting (wh. wd. imply mandatory status for anything wh. got through both groups) and discuss tactics with U.S.

5. Postmen‟s Pay. C.P.(64)139 [Enter P.M.G.

P.M.G. All men back today. No signs of solution yet.

M.L. T.U.C. may intervene later.

Ch.Exch. Let it run for a few days. Press not putting Govt. case across v. well.

P.M. Cd. PRU hurry up.

Ch.Exch. I have told Union that it cd. do job in 6 weeks – not 6 months.

But they don‟t – yet – want to listen to reason.

P.M. At least get this across.

Ch.Exch. May have to concede something and - if not justified by PRU – deduct from 2nd and 3rd years. But if leaks &amp; Smith rejects, we can‟t then do it.

P.M.G. Arbitrn. better? [Exit S/S.D. : M.A.F.F. : M.W.P.(C)

P.M. Tempting to leak these ideas: but leave alone for a few days.

[Exit P.M.G.

6. Electricity Transmission Lines. C.P.(64)135

[Enter Parly. Secs. M. Power. M.H.L.G.

Ch.Exch. Deadlocked on non availability of inspector‟s report. Therefore adopt course 2.

Parly Sec. M.P. Danger to supplies if gap not closed. Therefore can‟t do nothing.

M.P. Course 2 involves 2 years delay: i.e. line not available for 4 years! Course 3 would be right but offensive to public opinion. Therefore put part (3 or 4 miles) underground – justified by para 54 of inspector‟s report. Not a precedent – conceded already, for short distances, in e.g. Peak District. Cd. be done in time.

Adds £3-4 m.

L.Ch. Can‟t adopt proposal never before Board, without exploring altves.

Must go ahead with original proposal. wh. inspector didn‟t really condemn.

Ch.Duchy. Declared interest. (Cowdray‟s brother-in-law). But v. bad just before election.

S/S.E.S. Can‟t concede underground.

Ch.Exch. No! Ruinously extravagant.

M.W.P.(D) And we didn‟t concede underground in Kent, who are still angry.

ParlySec. Please some u‟ground! An area scheduled or of exceptional

M.H.L.G. beauty.

P.M. No: too expensive.

M.P.B.W. But, if so, we appear to override inspector‟s proposal for altve. routes, wh. will be published and then available to Board.? Publish: let Bd. consider for a time: then decide.

Parly.Sec. Possible two months ago: now too late if supplies not to be at risk

M.P. of being broken.

M.P.B.W. Then let Board say so. They shd. have said so to inspector, who might then have not put forward altve. route proposal.

Parly Sec. Board won‟t do this, for fear of appearing alarmist.

M.P. But if we publish and let B.O. consider, absence of decision unprecedented &amp; wd. maximise public concern.

P.M. Underground out. Must adopt original proposal.
