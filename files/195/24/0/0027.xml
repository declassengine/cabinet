C.M.(64)47 10 September 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

P.M. Prepare to advise Queen on Monday to dissolve Parlt. without prorogation.

Announce on Tuesday. Election 15 Oct. Keep strictly secret.

2. S. Rhodesia. (oral)

P.M. S. thinks indaba will suffice to make us grant indepce. We can‟t fall for this. Hence revised draft communiqué (circulated).

S/S.T.I. “Full opportunity”. If this attempt fails, do we wait to be bound for future attempts.

P.M. Must safeguard our pledges on sufficiently repve. instns.

L.P. Have we switched from this to popular consent as test?

If latter instead of, or in addition to, former, it must be a real and full test. How can it be if Press restricted and popular leaders detained?

M.H. Implies a refm. – enough in itself. Why not stop at “as a whole”?

P.M. Because constn. requires a refm. for constl. changes.

C.S. And must keep “full opportunity”.

L.P.S. But does it mean refm. on full suffrage? If so, we have never gone so far before.

S/S.D. And is it right to rest merely on consent, even if consent is to instns. not repve. enough?

P.M. ?Covered by second sent. of para 1.

L.P. But watch freedom of press and political opinion.

L.Ch. Must reserve our posn. until wishes ascertained.

S/S.D. But S. might just get favourable refm. If so, we shd. have to choose between conceding indepce. on present franchise or still insisting on s.v.i.

L.P. Our safeguard is that he won‟t be able to persuade us that A. opinion supports him.

C.S. Note that pol. leaders don‟t move in tribal areas.

P.M. Then he might get a favourable view: and choice wd. become real.

F.S. In that case we can‟t abandon s.v.i. Nor will intl. opinion accept ascertainment of A. opinion as adequate.

P.M. But S. will refuse communiqué wh. mentions s.v.i. by name.

F.S. That is covered by “restated” and refce. to C.P.M.S.

L.P. Difficult to insist on giving people s.v.i. if they don‟t want them.

L.Ch. But politically v. dangerous to appear to be abandoning them.

C.S. Particularly since in N. Rh. &amp; Ny., A – of type whom S. intends to keep disfranchised – are now exercising the vote.

L.Ch. Therefore must reserve our posn. completely. Can‟t appear to be committed without regard to s.v.i.

P.M. Say we reserve our posn. on all these issues? Or have two communiqués – ours stating consequences of unl. decln. That might provoke one. Which course is less damaging?

C.S. Two commns. wd. be damaging. Prefer one, reserving our posn.

L.P. I agree. One com. - reserving our posn. – better than a break.

Ch.Duchy. Break is a failure – electorally damaging.

S/S.D. I agree: but turn last sent. round.

L.P. But if he won‟t accept last sent, break.

M.W.P.(D) Watch freedom of Press.

L.P. And political prisoners. S. isn‟t going to release Nkomo. He is a political prisoner.

C.S. Not worried about possible precedent of “full opportunity”. We adopt different methods in different territories.

L.P. We have said “people as a whole”. S. has said majority. Therefore not merely satisfied on latter. Must repeat “people as a whole”.

S/S.I. Beware of tying our hands later, in anxiety to bind S. now, so that we never grant indepce. until full A. majy. And dangerous to be tied to s.v.i., if we don‟t know what they mean. We may be storing up a lot of trouble if we say “you prove it”: and then say it isn‟t enough. Both Consve. Party &amp; white Rhodesians will resent this.

P.M. L.Ch. &amp; C.S. to redraft.

3. Immigration Control. C.P.(64)165

H.S. As in memm. But examine statement closely. ?Omit “and will continue to maintain”.

L.P.S. Certainly – at least as regards dependants, who shd. stay behind.

H.S. If so, we shall treat aliens better than C‟w. citizens.

M.H. Omission of “wives and young children” will be challenged.

L.P. And socially undesirable to admit unaccompanied males only.

H.S. I agree: and police confirm.

L.P. If so, strengthens arguments for controlling numbers as a whole.

L.Ch. Maybe: but if tightening implies only strengthening of deportation, politically damaging: and admvly difficult without fingerprints etc.

H.S. Admve. difficulties can be overcome with help of M. Lab &amp; M.P.N.I. And no hope of better control without deportn.

M.Lab. We could give more help. More tricky is implied breach of pledges given in relation to existing legn.

S/S.I. And beware of impact on liberal opinion.

L.Ch. Omit “legn. must be tightened up”, especially since will be interpreted as new restricn. on power of entry when really no more than deportn.

H.S. V. well: but shall have to admit legn. required.

M.P. And we ought to control entry more strictly.

L.P. But no discrimn. against immigrants already here. Emphasise this.

S/S.D. Why say this (restrictive) thing now? V. general passage in Manifesto shd. suffice.

H.S. Statement essential and politically advantageous. Accept omission of legn. tightening: and second half of same sent, wh. is difficult for M. Lab.

M.H.L.G. Omit last two sentences of para 1? Keep Party politics out of this.

P.M. Yes: begin by emphasising our liberal tradition.

M.H. Single immigrants here must be allowed to bring family.

And emphasise control to advantage of immigrants as well as U.K.

P.M. L. Ch., H.S. &amp; C.S. to redraft. [Exit L. Ch.

4. Foreign Affairs. (oral) [Enter C.N.S.

a) Indonesia

F.S. Secy. C. debate in progress. Hope will proceed without any provocation by us in I. waters.

S/S.D. Risk of further I. attacks. Hence reinforcements being sent to F.E.

In addn., shd. – Victorious, on return from Australia, pass through Sunda strait (intln. waters). I. trying to ban this: and, if succeed, helpful to I. prestige and a bad precedent for further extension of I. domination.

Carrier vulnerable in narrow waters; and one part is terrl. water.

But must maintain right to pass through.

Therefore defer action until Secy. C. debate over. Thereafter follow normal practice of informing I. Govt. that, in view of I. naval exercises, inconvenient for V. to pass through but her two destroyer escorts will transit. (V. will go round north of Sumatra). I. Govt. may attack destroyers. If so, we shd. be able to strike back. But it wd. be war: and we shd. have to retaliate sharply.

P.M. Can‟t risk charge of putting carrier in this vulnerable posn.

F.S. I agree. Compromise is best means of maintaining freedom of innocent passage.

P.M. Particularly since in terrl. water stretch (30 miles on 3 mile limit), aircraft must be immobilised: and hills blind radar. And she wd. need to be reinforced by Centaur, brought from north to centre of I. exercises, where our aircraft cd. be challenged as being inside declared defence zone.

S/S.D. Agree. But must allow for possy. that S. is trying to close straits.

Therefore maintain our rights by means of destroyers.

M.W.P.(C) I. defence zones are both sides of straits. Can V. still cover destroyers?

C.N.S. Yes.

S/S.I. It will be a triumph for S. It is how he got rid of Dutch carrier from Irian.

S/S.D. Agree. And if destroyers are attacked, we must retaliate – including bases from wh. any aircraft are launched.

C.N.S. And we shd. also try – tho‟ can‟t guarantee – to defend destroyers themselves.

S/S.D. U.S. know our intentions but don‟t want to be involved unless whole

war escalates.

S/S.I. S. is a bully. Are we right to give way?

S/S.D. C. of S. : C in C. F.E. : H.C. in K.L. all advise against taking risk. Carrier meant to stand away, in open waters, to retaliate if necy.

M.H. But at least confine notificn. to destroyers. Say nothing about carrier.

S/S.D. F.O. must advise. [Exit C.S.

P.M. Approve. Keep F.S. &amp; self closely informed.

F.S. And must keep in touch on warnings to U.K. subjects re evacn. etc.

b) Cyprus

F.S. C. Govt. have now asked for unconditional extension of UNFICYP.

Must concur, having made clear we are not v. keen.

P.M. Agree to pay and stay for one more quarter. [Exit C.N.S.

5. Anglo-French Missile Agreement. C.P.(64)168

[Enter M.Avn.

M.Avn. As in memm. Requirement established. Cost might be £50m. Treasury agreed in principle, provided joint enterprise. Wd. have been ready for signature this week. Cronin got garbled version and leaked it - £100m. and nuclear warhead. I therefore thought must sign and announce forthwith.

P.M. Accept.

L.P. Does it increase Fr. nuclear capability?

M.Avn. We have made it capable of nuclear warhead without telling Fr.

But they may do it for themselves. In form it is designed for conventional warhead.

Guthrie‟s proposals for severance terms for dismissed BOAC staff very generous.

M.T. Much higher than Beeching‟s terms in comparable sitn. Risk of repercussions throughout industry, particularly railways.

M.Avn. I have no statutory control.

Ch.Secy. But shd. be referred to Wages Cttee., particularly since BOAC heavily dependent on Exchequer.

P.M. Tell Guthrie not to announce or leak without proper discussion with us.

And must postpone proposed meeting with unions until Wages Cttee

have considered – or at least not disclose to unions.

Report to me. [Re-enter L.Ch.

[Exit M. Avn.

6. Continental Shelf: Licences. C.P.(64)82

M.P. As in memm. A success story.

S/S.I. Don‟t pretend soln. for all problems. Oil companies sceptical whether return will justify investt. (wh. they have to make to prevent others).

M.P. £80m is a sizable investt. for this purpose. Agree don‟t exaggerate: but may be important devt.

L.P.S. Defend only 12½% royalty.

Ch.Sec. Because full rates of U.K. company taxn. will apply.

P.M. Avoid election stunt. ?Defer announcement till Thursday or even following Monday.

S/S.D. Better to announce before announce Election date?

M.P. Want confirmn. of all letters of intent.

P.M. Settle for Thursday. Coordinate publicity with M.W.P.(D).

7. Incomes Policy. C.P.(64)166

Ch.Sec. As in memm. Must now either be dealt with in Election context or not at all. Former preferable since we are committed to policy of expansion and it is increasingly clear that this depends on i. policy.

Unions may be provoked to oppose. Not necessarily a bad thing.

Therefore go ahead with statement – after El. date announced (since otherwise unions may resent lack of prior consultn.

M.Lab. I supported original proposal – and still do, even though now in Election context. Issue is going to bulk large in election.

L.P.S. Nationwide confce. may seem a gimmick. And unions might say wd. boycott it. ?Discussions with both sides separately a better first step.

Ch.Duchy. I agree. And make package deal – restrictive practices etc.

M.W.P.(D) Launch quietly in speech and elaborate at subsequent Press confce.

P.M. Unlikely to appeal to general public, who will expect, however wrongly, NEDC to cope. No great electoral advantage in keeping wages down.

M.H. Particularly if opposed by unions, whom we are not even consulting.

Ch.Sec. But our flank is exposed, if we do nothing And we shall have to do something after Election – sharp practice if we give no warning.

P.M. M.W.P.(D) has right compromise approach: but only discussions – not a formal National Confce.

8. Docks: Wages Claim. C.P.(64)157

M.Lab. As in memm. Unions trying to avoid confrontation before Election.

Crunch shd. not come until end Oct. But unofficial pressures may accelerate this.

M.T. Average wage is £9: av. earnings are £18. Therefore est. of 3.9% may be too low.

M.Lab. Fair average of 3 rates concerned. I shall not get involved.

P.M. Must watch need for preparations against a strike. Otherwise culpable.

I will discuss with M. Lab. soon.
