C.C.(65)3 21 January 1965. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip : M/S. Edn. – Thomson

L.P. As in statement. May have to be rearranged to accommodate export statement, if reinstated.

2. Oversea Affairs. (oral)

a) Rhodesia

P.M. Temperature rising again. If Smith comes for W.S.C.‟s funeral, chance for discussion, otherwise, clash may be inevitable – with serious economic consequences, qua copper, for both U.K. &amp; Zambia.

Essential to avoid any public statement about Rhodesia, especially if liable to provide excuse for U.D.I. by being provocative.

Ch.Exch. Is he bluffing out of chagrin? Remember Welensky.

P.M. Not sure. Parallel with Welensky not accurate – he never committed himself to U.D.I.

b) U.N.

M/S. F.O. Assembly drifting towards showdown on Monday. S.U. cd. make voluntary contribn.: or confrontation in Assembly – if we win, Assembly will lose Soviet vote: if we lose, Assembly will lose lot of U.S. contribns.: or Assembly may be postponed – to discredit of U.N., and great setback of U.N. peacekeeping role etc.

P.M. Postponement of Assembly till autumn v. dangerous: issue wd. only be postponed &amp; Assembly might disintegrate. Make clear we cd. not accept this.

M/S. F.O. Have done so and will continue to explore every compromise. If S.U. will pay reasonable voluntary contribns., Art 19 need not be raised.

But principle of Art 19 must be maintained: otherwise whole financing of U.N. becomes voluntary.

France as obdurate as S.U. No pressure here will help: but we are pressing other non-Communist defaulters.

P.M. If we go over the brink, some parachute action must be ready – at once.

S/S.D. Don‟t underrate dangers: both France &amp; S.U. wd. let U.N. disappear.

If we cd. save it, our prestige with Afro-Asians wd. rise: and our problems ease.

M.O.D. Try to avoid U.K. carrying any share of blame in A-A eyes.

M/S. F.O. Cardinal‟s speech shd. have made this clear. What else can we do?

P.M. If crunch on Monday, ?revive U. Thant‟s original idea of U.K. as

mediator – be ready to take some positive initiative.

c) A.N.F.

M/S. F.O. U.S. have now said publicly that our proposals are not in cold storage.

Even if no decision before German elections, they wd. favour machinery for processing actively in interim. First German reaction to our proposals not unfavourable: but will this survive de G./Erhard meeting at Rambouillet?

d) Congo

M/S.F.O. Political sitn. deteriorating. No signs of Tshombe being willing to broaden his Govt.: rebel morale increasing. A kind of V. Nam sitn. growing. M. Malcolm, as new H.Cm. in Kenya, will try to moderate Kenyatta‟s support for rebels.

3. Financial Situation. (oral)

Ch.Exch. Avoid public statements about possible changes in Bank Rate in either direction. 7% obviously temporary: but be careful – in private as well as in public.

4. Hospital Capital Expenditure 1965-66. C.(65)6 [Enter M.H.

M.H. As in memm: result of fact that planning ability of Boards has improved to point when plans are ready sooner than expected and work is held up unless money available. If no £5m., no major schemes can start or they must be halved. Either politically damaging.

F.Sec. Tsy. Don‟t oppose projects – only their implementn in 65-66. Ests for that year are already too high: demands on constn. industries already probably too heavy; to increase plan makes nonsense of planning and, politically, preventing starts less embarrassing than cutting back work in progress as result of overstraining resources.

Ch.Duchy. Wrong to arrest rhythm of hospital devt. No increase in programme involved: and only £5m. at stake. V. difficult to compare with e.g. Educn., old people‟s homes etc.: and shd. we have conceded N.H.S. charges if we had known about this?

P.M. Gap in machinery for assessing social priorities, aggravated by need to budget annually for 5 or 10 year programmes.

Is this a once for all £5m. acceleration: or will it accelerate progressively?

M.H. Programme has reached peak earlier than expected. Programme itself has lengthened, not contracted. But cdn‟t cut £5m. off next year – tho‟ thereafter programme can still be contained within approved allocation as a whole.

M.H.L.G. Can‟t judge in isolation from other claims.

P.B.T. I agree: too much on roads – not enough on hospitals.

S/S. E.S. A hospital in which MRC are concerned is at risk. If we lose it, we may lose specialist research staff for the future.

P.M. Normal investt. programming machinery is at work: but we need some marginal planning machinery in social services field.

M.H. Hospital programme has always come last. Bad if it were now to be first to be axed.

M.P. Unwise to recast plan – as M.H. proposes – in purely financial terms.

Can only judge on basis of individual projects and priority to be given to each on social &amp; economic grounds.

M.H. Will try to take account of this. But no great economic obstacle to hospital bldg. wh. is specialised. But if a cut, can‟t distinguish between one authority, and another. All must share.

M.Lab. Shortage of craftsmen in bldg industry; and even hospital bldg. requires them.

Ch.Exch. Only £5m. but illustrates basic problem.

This year‟s programme is already up by £4m.: now £5m. for next year‟s.

So not once for all: and doubtful whether later adjustment will be achieved. This sort of acceleration makes nonsense of planning.

Nurses &amp; G.P.‟s pay increase in the offing. Ests. now total £7153m.

£5 m. irrelevant in this context. But piecemeal additions can‟t go on.

I shall circulate a 5 year programme: and this shd. help to establish proper priorities. Once this is done, individual variations can‟t arise(!)

P.M. I endorse this view. Let Ch. Exch. &amp; M.H. explore compromise and show what concession of £5m. wd. involve for programme as a whole.

[Exit M.H.

4. Trade Disputes Bill: Retrospection. C.(65)7. [Enter A.G.

M.Lab. As in memm. Proceedings shd. be settled in accordance with law as it was when they started.

L.Ch. I agree.

A.G. I too.

S/S.W. But if Lords reject Bill?

M.Lab. R.Cmn. is our alibi.

A.G. And less retrospection the better, qua Lords.
