C.M.(64)26 7 May 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

M.W.P.(C) F.S. returns this morning after successful visit to Japan and Philippines.

P.M. Good. Must review S. Arabian and Malaysian posn. in light of this.

3. Malta. (oral)

C.S. Result of refm. obscure: must await report of observers. But clear (90%) vote for indepce., but divided 51:42 on constn.. 50% for Catholic constn. of B. Olivier on one hypothesis. This may make it difficult to refuse indepce.: but must consider. Can‟t risk refusing if this wd. unite B.O. and Mintoff against us.

S/S.D. Cyprus and Libya under threat. If Malta indept., might be of small value as a base, particularly if debarred to nuclear armed vessels. Might therefore be better to cut our losses and get out. Have Maltese realised this?

L.P. But cd. we let it become a Russian base?

C.S. But v. dangerous to refuse indepce.

S/S.D. Equally dangerous to lose Cyprus, Libya and Malta and be driven back on Cape route for access to F.E.

P.M. Presumably 31 May not on. If concede indepce., shd. still have to negotiate constn. and defence agt. This cd. be spun out till autumn?

C.S. V. doubtful. If we concede indepce., must negotiate defence agt. quickly – not before 31 May but perhaps before formally conceding that refm. justifies indepce.

Ch.Exch. But financial implicn. of indepce. wd. take a long time to sort out.

L.P. Catholic constn. wd. not survive long: Mintoff wd. win subsequent elecn. and substitute Socialist secular constn.

C.S. Yes – if we destroy B.O.

M.W.P.(C) As we shall, if we withdraw base.

P.M. If concede indepce., must try to pay for time on finance, defence and

constl. details.

Must consider further next week.

[Exit C.S.

4. Stationing Costs in Germany. C.P.(64)92

[Enter Parly Sec. B/T.

Ch.Sec. As in memm. G. might be ready to go a good deal further. Therefore I shd. go: but I may fail, and sitn. then worse than if had not gone.

Can‟t hope for another DM 600 m.p.a.; but still worth our while at DM 450.m – even tho‟ settlement with U.S. more favourable and our costs rising.

M.W.P.(C) G. may be influenced by our policy on credits for Soviet bloc.

Ch.Sec. Have tried to show no link – except that, in so far as G. don‟t pay, we have greater need to promote trade.

S/S.D. Europe least likely to produce war. Therefore reduction of BAOR is worth considn. – provided that Tsy will finance extra accn. in U.K. (probably at cost wh. wd. outweigh saving in foreign exchange.)

P.M. We cdn‟t limit this at this stage: but perhaps after elecn.

M.P.B.W. And we import more from G. than we export.

Ch.Sec. Not so true after first month‟s figure.

L.P.S. Mustn‟t hesitate to be tough about reduction, if necessary.

P.M. But not at risk of public row in NATO in next few months.

Merely remind them of original agt. on this point: but don‟t threaten.

M.P.B.W. ?Reinforce by moderate deceleration of bldg. programme in Germany.

P.M. No action yet: but Cab. discussion on all these issues quite soon.

Meanwhile Ch. Sec. to be as tough as possible: accept we may fail.

D.O.P.(O) to consider comparative economics of withdrawing some troops. [Exit Parly Sec. B/T.

5. Fishery Limits. C.P.(64)93,94,95 [Enter Att.Gen.

L.Ch. Before convention we gave notice of extension of f. limits, without saying by how much. I held that intl. law wd. not permit extension beyond intl. waters. Convn. adopted 6 &amp; 6 – first 6 for exclusive, second 6 for regulated fishing with reserved rights for those who have fished there. Can only do this if we leg.

Cd. leg to give effect Convn. only in reln. to signatories. O.K.

But Russians have not signed; how deal with them. Bill, wh. purports to apply limits to them, wd. be contrary to intl. law. Efforts to persuade them to acquiesce may be too late for purposes of Bill.

If they don‟t acquiesce, we must either impose limits and risk challenge at Intl. Court, or resile and lose benefits of convn.

Intl. Coourt unpredictable: but general practice is towards recognising f. limits beyond terrl. waters. We cd. also say that we were extending terrl. waters only for purposes of f. jurisdiction. (cf. Norwegian precedent).

In last resort therefore, cd. hope to recover charge at Intl. Court.

F.O. counter proposal no good. (1) Bill on this basis wd. attract

ie without attention to problem. (2). If reciprocity wd. justify us in case of

specific refce Russia (who have 12 mile terrl. sea), do it straight. (3) Technique is by

Bill. refce. to indivl. states: but this deprives us of main argt. wh. I have deployed.

Best course to get acquiescence before introdn. Otherwise, introduce as is; it will please fishermen!

A.G. I remain of view that intl. law at present does not provide for f. limits beyond terrl. waters. Must therefore admit extension of terrl. waters, for purposes of f. limits – as in Nordic case.

L.P. ?Simply follow that precedent.

Att.Gen. But must admit 12 m. terrl. sea – embarrassing in other contexts.

S/S.D. Defence implicns. of this wd. need thought.

L.Ch. Intl. Court unpredictable: but they might be persuaded. And we wd. maintain we shd. exercise terrl. waters rights only in first 3 miles.

M.W.P.(C) FO lawyers support Att.Gen – wd. lead to 12 mile terrl. waters in end.

F.O. counter proposal. (1) It wd. not attract public attention, wh. will arise anyhow. (2) No delay: cd. be redrafted on F.O. basis v. quickly and cd. take effect as quickly. (3) R. and N. wd. be excluded by reciprocity: and Poles uncertain on either Bill.

M.A.F.F. Our intention was always indiscriminate. Therefore must extend limits and ignore risk of Intl. Court Oppn. won‟t raise – unpopular with fishermen. And 13 countries now have f. limits beyond terrl. sea: but nobody has challenged and point has gone by default.

But Japan and Israel, who are not parties to Convenn. cd. come and fish in our waters on F.O. basis of reciprocity, if conceded.

S/S.S. Can‟t revert to weak FO Bill without losing political advantage with Scots fishermen. Our friends accept our proposals: must risk R.P. &amp; N. oppn.

L.Ch. But is not breach of intl. law, since does not operate without Order.

M.W.P.(C) Convenn. took terrl. sea out of arena: don‟t bring 12 mile terrl. sea back

by back door.

P.M. Intl. law changing: and long time before we shd. be challenged.

L.P. And F.O. Bill wd. lead to as much legal difficulty – e.g. “any other grounds recognised by intl. law”. Better to adopt robust view. Defence interest exaggerated: our posn. gradually being eroded and we must watch our own interests. Defence case has gone by default.

P.M. Accept as is: f. jurisdn. only in outer belt. Delay introdn. if possible, until answers received.
