C.M.(64)23 16 April 1964. 10. 30. a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

Bills required for rest of Session. Suggestions welcomed.

2. Pay issues. (oral)

Ch.Exch. We held to parity with C.S. U.P.L. rested on para in Priestley report putting p‟mme in special posn. I therefore concede enquiry on this done, on basis that thereafter normal procedure follows.

M.H. Statement on chemist‟s remunn. on Monday. They claim £9m. - £3½ m. for costs, (wh. is justified by indept enquiry) and £5½m. for “profit”, wh. has still to be negotiated – at a considerably lower figure.

Ch. Secy. Costs may have to be given retrespve. effect – but not “profit”.

M.H. I agree.

3. School Building Survey. (oral)

S/S.E. Eccles instituted survey of existing schools, by criteria of “defects” (14) agreed with L.E.A.‟s. Most have some defects. Cost to rectify - £1000m.

We are committed to publish. Cd. have deferred until early elecn., but not for 6 months. Best to eliminate cost of rectificn. (wholly artificial). Also add explany foreword, disclosing (limited) intentions as regards improvement etc. and putting issues into perspective – i.e. emphasising amount already spent on educn. and need for priorities.

Ch.Sec. Better to use material in W.P. of our own, putting right emphasis on amount already done, ??? of some “defects” (eg. site), and eliminating word “defect”.

M.W.P.(D) Same wd. be true of houses, hospital etc. Therefore don‟t whitewash too much.

P.M. Publish on Derby Day! ERP to consider draft.

[Enter Parly. Sec. F.D. (Thomas)

4. Foreign Affairs.

a) Yemen

Parly Sec. Secy. C. discussn. ended with resn. on which we abstained, explaining that we did so because resn. was positive in urging restraint on parties and invoking good offices of Secy Genl to settle issues.

Only U.S. abstained with us: Fr. voted for resn.

S.G has instructed Speaker to undertake discussions in Sana‟a.

New overflight incident: Yemen denies it.

P.M. Must make renewed effort to bring U.S. policies into line with ours.

Now 40,000 U.A.R. troops in Yemen. Not a bad thing, so long as Aden holds. Further considn. before F.S. meets Rusk, with an eye on reactions of Kuwait and Libya.

L.Ch. Important to secure max publicity at home for incidents and for our protests to U.N.

b) Cyprus

Parly Sec. Secy. Genl. wants police force. We have refused to contribute. S.G.

F.O. still presses for 10 officers and 30 constables. S. of S. doubts wisdom: police wd. be associated with conflict. H.C. also thinks U.K. police contingent inadvisable. So does Gyoni‟s police adviser. Therefore maintain refusal.

L.P.S. I agree. It wd. be v. unwise.

L.P. But wd. that commit us to permanent policy of S. areas (with some contribns. from other countries)

M/S.C.R.O. Gyoni determined to have intl. police force: and, even if unwise, it might pay us to go along with it at right stage.

P.M. Dangerous to hold out future hopes? Better to reject outright now, on grounds of enough U.K. troops already. Say nothing about future.

Submit draft refusal to me.

[Exit M/S. C.R.O.
