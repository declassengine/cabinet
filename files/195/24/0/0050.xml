C.C.(65)6 1 February 1965. 11 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P. As in statement.

2. S. Rhodesia. (oral)

P.M. Saturday‟s talk with Smith v. strange. He regards views as irreconcilable and is looking for occasion for U.D.I. Meanwhile, will stretch constn., by ⅔ majority procedure, in illiberal direction. Sees no prospect of testing inarticulate African opinion: look at examples elsewhere in Africa.

He resents our threats if U.D.I and is actively considering counter threats against Zambia copper. Therefore we must examine possy. of importing coal &amp; power into Z; economically vulnerable points of S. Rh. since U.N. wd. propose economic blockade; send Minl. mission (instead of Parly. or C‟w mission). – C‟w Sec. &amp; L. Ch, wh. S. wd. resent but accept, on basis of access to anybody not in prison on criminal charge. (i.e. Nkomo and Sithole‟s lieutenants). May do no good: but will gain time &amp; show good will. S. wd. not accept Oppn. leaders as well.

First Secy. Does it involve L.Ch. – in political issue?

P.M. No: constl. issues involved.

M.O.D. Add me – some aid element in final package?

P.M. Preferably an official of O.D.M.: negotns. on aid etc. shd. start again, even if slow.

3. Cigarette Advertising. C(65)9 [Enter M.H. : P.M.G.

P.M.G. As in memm.

First Secy. Public opinion now less troubled. ?A new build up required before any drastic action.

P.M. My original suggn. was impromptu. Don‟t interfere with human rights; but must try to avoid encouraging young to smoke by glamorous advt.

M.H. Public opinion and tobacco industry expect ban on T.V. advt. And public campaign, of which this wd. be part, is being built up again.

M.T. Anomalous that public transport shd. both advertise cigs, &amp; warnings against them.

M.Techy. Public annoyed by T.V. advts. anyhow.

L.Ch. I oppose all censorship, but support this.

Ch.Exch. My revenue! It is already flattening out. I agree – let public opinion grow first.

M.H. It can‟t come into effect for 3 months after announcement.

P.M. Prior action in schools campaign would help.

M.A.F.F. Is evidence conclusive enough to “carry” this act?

P.M. Approve: reconsider wording to meet M.A.F.F.‟s point: link with schools: warn Lobby. [Exeunt M.H. : P.M.G.

4. Commonwealth Immigration. C.(65)12 [Enter Parly Sec. Col Office.

H.S. As in memm. Net annual intake now greater than before control – therefore evasion must be growing. Hence proposed statement.

L.P. C.I. Cttee. unanimously opposed to new restrictive legn. and in favour of better admve. measures to prevent evasion – particularly at source.

[Absent for an interval.]

P.M. Agree on statement: comments on drafting to be sent in.

[Exit Parly Sec. Col. Office

5. Defence Economies. (oral) [Enter M. Avn.

P.M. As in brief. Two aspects – need for economies: economic dislocation of industry.

a) P1154 – increasingly expensive: and gap before available. Therefore cancel &amp; substitute P1127 (Kestrel) with some Phantoms. Kestrel may get some European orders. Phantoms to have R-R engines &amp; Br. avionics.

b) Shackleton to be replaced by modified Comets.

c) HS681 – may be v. expensive: and C130 much cheaper and more quickly available. Problem at Shorts – extra Belfasts not justified.

d) T.S.R.2. No election pledge to maintain it. But empt. implicns. serious: and risk of loss of technical teams: to U.S.A. Mix of TSR2‟s and TFX‟s wholly impracticable &amp; uneconomic. TFXs are available on generous financial terms. But TFX1 may – but may not – be superseded by Mk. II.

Even so, scrap TSR2 wh. is still really at devt. stage? No – premature to decide on either TSR2 or TFX yet. Let TSR2 continue until defence review complete and prospects of both aircraft clearer.

If cancelled (with the others) saving of £700/800 m. over 10 yrs. But redeployment of resources and reshaping of industry on a co-operative – and therefore more viable – basis.

Result – not a large running down of industry yet: but marked redn. in r.&amp;d. capability. First Secy‟s cttee to consider implicns on redundancy etc, particularly at Shorts.

Announce tomorrow: reinforced by accident to TSR2 last week, wh. I may include in announcement.

Ch.Exch. Dislike postponement – we shall slide into a commitment.

On this basis £2400m. (at ‟64 prices) will be defence budget of 1969/70; and either we must cancel TSR2 or shed some commitments.

Otherwise defence will prevent civil expansion. Industry does not show economic return on labour force employed. Therefore if TSR2 goes ahead, don‟t explore co-opve. projects: but, if we cancel it, then a case for them.

S/S.D. Cancellation of all 4 wd. save £600m. in cash at $ cost of £600m. over 10 years.

But saves £1300 m. of resources, wh. if redeployed, shd. earn the $.

And if keep to TSR2, over 5 years, even defence spending on aircraft will be £140m. more than under Tories; if we cancel, it will be £190m. less. And bulk of expre. on TSR2 wd. be in 1967-1971; on TFX after 1971.

Tho‟ some delay inevitable, it costs £4m. a month; and it makes no sense unless final decision is cancellation.

M.H.L.G. Then why postpone it?

P.B.T. Decisive argument on B/P grounds. Don‟t incur $ liability for sale of budget relief: and don‟t endanger aircraft exports prospects.

P.M. Must have more infmn before can take realistic decision – particularly as regards comparative costs and operational performances.

S/S.D. Ch. Exch. &amp; I agree cancellation right. But not easy to argue case in public – e.g. will BAC offer fixed price for T.S.R.2? and how many do we want (wh. affects cost comparability)? But decision must come by Summer at latest.

M.Avn. Cost argument more finely balanced than appears. And cancelln. of TSR2 wd. create 15000 redundancies. Must give ourselves time to cope with this – and not by means of new TSR2‟s. £4m. a month for short period is worth it; technical troubles may affect TFX as well as TSR2.

M.P. Must watch posn. at Shorts. Can we say anything at this stage?

M.Tech. Can‟t slash TSR2 now, for techl. and empt. reasons.

P.M. Agreed – for my statement tomorrow.

S/S.D. Yes: not today (despite P.N.Q.) since arrangements with U.S. must be made before any public announcement.

M.P. Our study must include examn. of reasons why Oppn. delayed prepn. of replacement aircraft.

P.M. Hence “irresponsible” – in our amdt. To V of censure.

6. Higher Education. C.(65)11

S/S.E.S. As in memm. T.T.C.‟s not an addl. commitment beyond Tories‟ programme.

And Advisory Council‟s recmn. for £120,000 places will soon be published. Must anticipate it by announcing target of our own.

Ch.Exch. Can‟t consider in isolation: and can‟t justify simply by refce. to what Tories said they wd. do in pre-Election period. S/S.E.S. must follow “basic” and “additional” programmes drill. Proposals can‟t be accommodated even within “basic” programme? I can agree on (i) (ii) &amp; (iii); even (iv): but not (v).

S/S.E.S. If accept (iv), (v) implies no extra commitment – it merely apportions remaining places. And my proposals all fall within “basic” programme to be judged in July.

Ch.Exch. Indemnity implied limitn. of technical colleges to 50.000?

S/S. E.S. Yes.

M.H.L.G. We committed ourselves to T.T. expansion – even at cost of delaying extra Univ provision – since former more productive of teachers. Make this clear – especially since cheaper. Therefore accept extra 10,000.

M.Techy. ?Also say “with particl. refce. to need to produce more scientists &amp; techns”.

S/S. E.S. Yes. [Exit M. Techy.

Ch.Duchy. Must we avoid all statements &amp; commitments till July review? We are dealing here only with an objective.

Ch.Exch. But v. specific allocns. – i.e. no room for manoeuvre left.

P.M. Accept i)-(iv): on (v) Ch. Exch. Ch. Duchy &amp; S/S. E.S. shd. agree acceptable statement within the 30%.

F.S. Pressure greatest on T.T. supply.

S/S.S. Mention Heriot Watt‟s in Scotland.

7. Sir Winston Churchill. (oral)

P.M. Read to Cabinet Lady C.‟s message of thanks for Cab‟s condolences.
