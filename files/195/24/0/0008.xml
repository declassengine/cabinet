C.M.(64)28 14 May 1964. 12 noon

1. Southern Arabia. (oral)

P.M. Decapitated bodies found. Must so admit to H/C. (in C.S.‟s statement.)

C.S. My visit. Soldiers in good heart: Arab troops co-operating.

Road cleared and commanding positions secured. Two fertile valleys occupied. First part of opn. therefore complete. Tribesmen have evacuated area. To pursue into mountains wd. be v. difficult. Submission must be secured otherwise – i.e. by harassment and attacks on mountain strongholds and interception of reinforcements from Yemen.

Arduous conditions: troops must be rested: relief battn. required.

Hope tribesmen will eventually make submission and give guarantees.

Surrender of arms too humiliating.

Leaflets, signed by Fedl. authorities, will be distributed accordingly – with no indicn. of our action if they don‟t comply.

Political. Discussed with Adeni and Fedl. Govts. and with political parties including P.S.P., Aden T.U.C. etc. Aden feel Fedl. Govt. has too much power in Aden. But nobody advocated separation – only modification – or removal of U.K. base. Much less enthusiasm for Yemen than 18 months ago.

Agreement to resume deferred constl. confce. in June. Confce. of Fedl. and Aden Ministers – i.e. all 16 States of Fedn. Political parties will not be included – wd. make confce. too large. But preparatory confce. in Aden at wh. all parties will be allowed to express views.

London confce. will lead to clash between Aden and Fedl. Ministers, especially on date of indepce. (wh. Fed. Govt. don‟t really want.) 5 yrs. hence might be possible date. Something must be done to improve relationship between Aden Parlt. and Fedl. Parlt.

Economic. Working Party examining devt. Must decide as soon as report – must be before June confce.

S/S.D. Must send extra battn. But form of announcement must be watched: and routing difficult – e.g. Sudan ominous for first time.

L.Ch. Watch harassment. Mustn‟t attack people (incl. women and children) who have fled but are not taking part in rebellion.

Concede rifles. But? insist on surrender of other weapons.

Where are we going? Is Aden vital, particly. if access now in danger?

C.S. Can‟t abandon it at this point.

P.M. Might compel us to abandon Singapore too. Not possible until altves. explored. Also watch oil supplies: and risk of Nasser taking over Gulf.

S/S.D. I agree. Must hold Aden – and give no other impression – until wholly

clear that we can let it go. If we let it go now, we lose M.E. and leave it open to our enemies. Ditto with Singapore. U.S. want us to stay in both places – even more than in Europe.

F.S. I agree. Can‟t risk a vacuum in M.E. Gulf, S. Arabia wd. be endangered; oil wd. be threatened; and relationship with U.S. wd. be imperilled.

Political devt. of Fedn. of Aden will be v. valuable. But does SOSLON 59 go too far? It cd. go further than Cab. instrn. and C.S.‟s own statement.

Don‟t risk undue weakening of forces at Bahrain for sake of Aden; watch this in reinforcing Aden and restore Bahrain garrison as soon as possible.

P.M. C.S. F.S. and S/S.D. to clear draft in SOSLON 59. But don‟t handicap air effort to extent wh. implies large reinforcement by ground troops.

C.S. Yes. Can‟t rely on ground troops in that country. Must use air effort with least political embarrassment.

L.P. But watch women and children.

M.W.P.(D) Watch presentation: correspondents etc. Those at back must get as much as those at front.

C.S. They have been given too much latitude: but can‟t clamp down now.

Interest may die away now that first stage is over.

M.H.L.G. ?Reinforce our efforts at U.N.

F.S. Avoid action in S.C. Pursue observers, boundary demarcation etc. and demilitarisation. [Exit C.S. &amp; S/S.D.

2. Radio Caroline. (oral) [Enter P.M.G.

H.S. Parly. pressure growing. But can‟t legislate in this Parlt. Make this clear but leave door open for it subsequently and justify delay by refce. to Eur. Convention, on wh. we shan‟t know till later in summer.

P.M.G. Avoid too firm a commitment on issue of commercial sound b‟casting.

Might have to concede limited amount of experiment.

L.P. No point in forbidding it in U.K. but liberating it on sea, or in allowing interference with shipping. Must therefore decide ships shd. be disallowed.

L.Ch. But how? To deny supplies etc. leaves field free for foreign competitors. Only intl. convention, implemented by domestic legn. wd. do the trick.

We can‟t stop the Caroline on the high seas by ourselves.

M.W.P.(D) Some Eur. countries have legn. Eur. convn. not an excuse for indefinite delay. Also growing pressure for commercial sound radio.

But if we concede to it, B.B.C. will react and provincial newspapers (relying on Oppn. refusal to countenance it) wd. stop supporting us.

L.P.S. Gramophone and record makers also opposed. May try to jam Caroline!

P.M. Take initiative by summoning intl. confce.

M.H. Yes – but base it primarily on ultimate threat to safety of air and sea navign. by multiplicn.

M.P.B.W. But must be clear about political objective. No real objn. to commercial sound b‟casting.

H.S. If so, must decide this objectively, not merely because of Caroline.

M.W.P.(D) I support M.H. – otherwise chaos on Eurn. frequencies and freedom to listen to what you want will become freedom to listen to virtually nothing at all.

L.P. Can‟t let them entrench themselves without warning, or others invest in them without warning.

P.M. Say intln action must be taken, in view of safety risks etc.

Thereafter investors do it at own risk.

Ch.Whip. E.Anglian members know Caroline popular in E.Anglia. And others support on philosophical grounds. Therefore sooner Govt. make attitude clear the better.

P.M. Cttee. of Ministers, under H.S., to draft announcement, by way of warning, after Whitsun recess (with some preliminary softening up of back benchers).

L.P.S. Warning of control or prohibition?

P.M. Needn‟t settle that yet.
