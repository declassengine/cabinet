C.C.(64)1 19 October 1964. 3 p.m.

1. Procedure. (oral)

P.M. Congratulations. [Smoking: yes!]

Refer to C(64)1.

Advice on devolution, balanced by collective responsy.

“ “ brevity.

“ “ confidential nature of Cabinet proceedings. Avoid interviews, T.V. performances etc. for some weeks.

Pps. of previous admn. – not available, both Cab. pp. &amp; departmental pp.: but commitments to third parties must be disclosed.

Orgn. of work of junior Ministers: senior Ministers must decide for themselves – but, if time permits, any submission to Minister should go through Parly. Sec.: and fullest use shd. be made of M/S. &amp; Parly Sec., at Ministers‟ discretion.

2. Economic Situation. (oral)

P.M. Have discussed with Fi. Sec. &amp; Ch. Exch. Sitn. worse than expected.

Fi.Sec. Little can be done in first year to affect immediate sitn.

No refce. to current figures, wh. are still being worked out. But sitn. is bad and has been deteriorating for long time. Large B/P. deficit in prospect for long time. Not a financial crisis: and £ holding well today. But basic imbalance – imports too high &amp; exports too low.

Measures of restriction must be accompanied by measures of stimulation.

Former, wh. are inevitable, will be offset, in our package announcement, by latter. Meanwhile, no public statements shd. be made by Ministers about posn. or probable remedies.

In longer term must change balance of Economy and redirect resources, especially away from defence &amp; prestige projects. B/P. measures and severance pay particularly urgent.

Ch.Exch. 1) Short term problem of financing B/P deficit can be managed by mobilising swap arrangements etc.

2) Long term problem of financing B/P deficit will involve recourse to I.M.F. But parallel action to reduce deficit required. Can count on basic support of other countries.

3) Public expedre.: former Govt.‟s programmes involve expedre. wh. might require increase in taxes, even on 4% growth hypothesis.

Therefore new bids – re our own programmes – shd. be shown separately. Thereafter Cab. must decide priorities and method of financing.

4) Unnecy. expre. must be eliminated – to give room for manoeuvre. Must avoid deflation and stop-go: not merely restriction but change of direction.

P.M. Full decision by whole Cab. in due course.

Run on pound unlikely. Borrowing necy. in short term: but not a long term soln. Therefore measures must be appropriate and announced.

Balance of economy must be redressed by long-term redirection of resources – not by deflation, but by selective expansion.

Impressed by official machine‟s grasp of problem and readiness to act.

Follow up public expre. More detailed proposals for Cab. on Thursday – and then public announcement, followed by meetings with T.U.C. F.B.I. etc.

Ch.Duchy. Social service payments are transfer payments: and are offset by contribn. Can they go ahead?

P.M. Follow proposed procedure: leave priorities till later. But social services will, subject to Cab, be v. high.

M.Tech. I haven‟t any bid at the moment: but I shall have.

Fi.Secy. Food &amp; raw materials probably exempt from import restriction.

S/S.Def. A target redn. for defence?

P.M. Discuss with Ch. Exch: also Fin. Secy. with M.H.L.G. &amp; Scotland on housing.

M.Tech. New arbitrn. machinery wd. help to recreate industrial confidence.

M.Power. Watch steel imports: U.K. cd. produce them.

F.S. Pl. consult me about foreign implications of import restrictions.

3. S. Rhodesia. (oral)

P.M. My own pre-election talks with Smith were without commitment.

Therefore our hands are free.

Com.Sec. Smith proposed – on election day – indaba on Tuesday. Our predecessors rejected – to their credit.

I am going to Zambia on Wednesday: I might go on to S. Rh. - provided I meet Nkomo &amp; Sithole too – to make our posn. clear. Smith may reject proviso and go ahead to unill. decln. Shd. we anticipate this by statement, indicating it wd. be illegal.

P.M. Let D.O.P. discuss policy on Wed. – memm to be circulated.

4. Mineral Rights in N. Rhodesia. C.(64)2

C.S. As in memm. Settle thus if we can.

Ch.Exch. No: we shd. be helping not Zambia but Ch. Co. i.e. mainly Oppenheimer. Therefore Zambia must decide for herself: she will

collect the money and cd. afford modest compensn. If so, I.B.R.D. wd. not hold it against Z. – especially since it wd. reduce Z‟s recourse to Bank.

P.M. But there is a commitment – by previous Labour Govt. ?Try to get deferment of post-indepce. action by Z.

C.S. Cd. try. But one interpretn. of 1950 Agt. cd. make us liable for full compensn.

P.M. L.Ch. to examine nature of commitment. In light of his opinion, we shd. ask Zambia to defer decision. For D.O.P. on Wed.
