C.M.(64)25 30 April 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

M.H.L.G Debate on S.E. Study: land values will be topical: stand on free market principle. No magic control of land prices (apart from fiscal measures).

M.P. Remedy lies in releasing more land on edges of towns, particularly farms.

M.H.L.G. Any release of land before election v. inadvisable. Can‟t let villages sprawl.

S/S.D. But planning restrictions v. severe. Quite possible to release more land.

C.S. But no gradual encroachment on Green Belt.

L.Ch. I agree with S/S.D. More land wd. reduce prices.

M.H.L.G. Irrelevant. Pressure for housing so strong that prices will rise anyhow.

Better to criticise Oppn. policy wh. – by taxn. - wd. put up prices even higher. All I need say is that we don‟t propose to control land prices, as Oppn. propose. Is that agreed?

Shortage of land is not holding up land: we are building 400,000 houses a year.

H.S. Two grievances are power of landlord (wanting to develop) to give notice to quit: and feeling that profit is being made out of land for building – for which only remedy is capital gains tax, wh. Party wd. not support.

P.M. Consider – ?in E.P.C. – whether some easement possible: but support M.H.L.G. on main issues. And review planning procedures – too slow and restrictive. Include L.Ch. in discussion. Avoid any public reference to tax.

M.H.L.G. C. Gains tax wd. not be unpopular: but wd. merely increase price.

H.S. Must give more publicity to weakness of Oppn. policy.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Cyprus

M.W.P.(C) Dixon reports U. Th. v. reluctant to let U.N. force take mily. action – eg disarming.

C.S. Force now a farce. Reconsider our own participn. when renewed

Turks may be provoked into invasion.

M.W.P. and I will be neutral when we see mediator tomorrow.

S/S.D. 2000 is min. realistic number of troops from U.K. after withdrawal of main body (if we do it). Must also leave H.Q.: and have somebody to hand over to. Avoid half way house, wh. we cdn‟t operate.

M.W.P.(C) Mustn‟t overtly wreck U.N. force.

P.M. Reconsider after discussn. with mediator. Might be able to compel U.N. force.

b) U.K. oil assets in Egypt

M.P. Assets of Shell and B.P. in Egypt have been nationalised. Companies want to play down in order to get compensn.. But this is discrimination (does not apply to U.S. companies); and a bad precedent for other countries. Therefore protest to Nasser, even tho‟ nl. done on 26 March.

M.W.P.(C) Wait until approaches to Nasser by London.

P.M. Reconsider thereafter.

c) Malta

C.S. Reversal of indepce. policy has been v. difficult. Referendum was a way out – in hope it wd. be inconclusive and therefore provide excuse for deferring indepce. Refm. this week-end. Result unpredictable. If it favours Olivier‟s constn. (wh. we wdn‟t accept) we shall be in a jam!

d) S.Rhodesia

P.M. Read answer to P.Q. about invitation to P.M. of S.Rh. to attend meeting of C‟w. P.M.s.

C.S. Precedent, tho‟ not conclusive, clear enough to justify this.

3. Provision for Redundancy. C.P.(64)91 [Enter M.P.N.I.

M.L. As in memm.

S/S.I. I support w.r.b.; need not extend to sickness benefit.

Redundancy payment more doubtful. Can‟t agree form with industry: and not necy. if w.r.b. adopted.

Ch.Exch. I remain sceptical. Favours single man: and won‟t affect attitude of people becoming unemployed. Can‟t resist extension to sickness. And T.U.‟s give priority to increase in flat rate benefit.

Ch.Secy. Means another 2d. on stamp: and complete recasting of central scheme.

M.P.N.I. I support M.L.: but must extend to sick and probably widows, at extra

cost as in Annex A.

L.Ch. I agree: a social, as well as economic, project.

Ch.Exch. I agree – if it is done at all!

Bill wd. be unprotected by M. Resn. therefore agree to amdt. on this point. Since purely economic reasons are weak, better not to do it.

Break at age 65 illogical.

Ch.Duchy. I support M.Lab. Scheme wd. have important psychological impact in relation to automation, over employment etc. Significant that employers want it, as high priority. Unions irrelevant: they won‟t help us anyhow at this stage. Justifiable on economic grounds alone.

L.Ch. But legn. before end of July impossible: and we shd. be outbid – over whole field – by Oppn. This is for manifesto. Even so, difficult in relation to those on small fixed income.

M.Lab. Bill wd. be complex. Doubtful if practicable before election. Work out during summer and put in Manifesto.

Ch.Secy. No easier to resist repercussns. in new Parlt.: and 1966 is earliest date for increase in benefits if we are to keep expre. in this field under control.

M.P.N.I. And whole contribn. structure wd. have to be changed – for wh. there is not time.

H.S. Politically v. valuable at Election. Don‟t waste in advance by Bill on wh. we shd. have to resist many amdts.

Ch.Duchy. If it includes sick and widows, I agree to leave for Manifesto.

P.M. Great political advantage in legn. on Statute Book. But difficulties too great. Even so, have plan worked out in detail – down to widows‟ allces. – and published well before Election.

S/S.D. I agree. Important in Scotland.

L.Ch. But effect on stamp?

M.P.N.I. That is why contribns. structure must be revised.

M.P.B.W. At least do diffl. benefits for aged now.

Ch. Sec. No: still needs legn., wh. wd. be wide open to amdt.

M.P.N.I. And only possible in context of general exercise.

M.W.P.(D). Then publish scheme as W.P. in July, as basis for legn in autumn.

Ch. Sec. No: an Aunt Sally for Oppn during election campaign. And requires a decision on sick and widows.

S/S.I. And anomalous to publish in ‟64 plan for dealing in ‟66 with economic problem of redundancy.

Ch.Exch. And will not help employers to get tougher.

M.Lab. They think it will. And other countries have adopted it.

P.M. Draft W.P. on basis of Table 2, without commitment. M.P.N.I. to do this.

M.P.M. Only for short-term benefits? Or for prefl. treatment for old and flat benefit increase as well? Don‟t get policy as a whole out of balance.

Ch.Secy. I agree. Within limited funds, old and flat rate may need to be given priority.

P.M. Play redundancy payments down, even if discussns. have to continue.

W.P. shd. come to Cab. – via PNI Cttee – as soon as possible and at early stage of prepn. It shd. cover everything in Annex 2, leaving us to eliminate if necy. [Exit M.P.N.I.

4. Kennedy Round. C.P.(64)90

S/S.I. Opens on 4 May – merely taking note and declns. of general intent.

Thereafter, how can we advance posn. in technical sitn. described in memm?

Probably nothing. Confrontation with EEC useless: but Rey indicates room for manoeuvre on EEC posn. on disparities, provided U.S. will move on non-tariff items.

Rey favours beginning real negotns. in Jan. ‟65, with view to new tariffs operating in Jan. ‟66. We can accept and press for discussions to be speeded up – even tho‟ U.S. may not be ready to table exceptions by Sept. Acceptable to U.K. industry so long as prospect of substantial linear cut persists.

Ch.Exch. Other Ministers favour confrontn. with Six during this year. Therefore reconsider (with M.A.F.F. present) after opening meeting.

S.S.I. We shd. get nothing out of it: and U.S. wdn‟t support, since might wreck K. Round. And neither we nor U.S. are so “clear” on tariff levels, non-tariff items and agrl. support that we can throw stones at Six.

No scope in special arrangement with EFTA and U.S. to discriminate against Six – who take 20% of our trade, as compared with 8% with U.S.A.

P.M. Agree as proposed for Monday. Re-discuss when M.Agr. available.

5. East West Trade. (oral)

S/S.I. Renewed Trade Agt.: and they have undertaken to close gap between cash and credit transactions – v. satisfactory.

Trade discussns. with Cz. and Hungary also concluded satisfactorily. A helpful precedent for other Balkans.

P.M. L.B.J. has attacked F.S. on trade with Cuba v. strongly. We mustn‟t yield on an argument wh. applies also to eg. S. Africa.

6. Immigration Control. C.P.(64)89

H.S. Factual: for informn. Minl. Cttee. meets monthly.

900 vouchers a week reduced to 400: but no control over dependents.

They equal voucher holders. Therefore current rate is about 40,000. To stop this altogether wd. be electorally popular in big cities: but cdn‟t do it vis a vis C‟wealth. Normal admn. of Act v. simple. Only number of vouchers is arguable. No doubt social effects of immigration undeniable in long term.

C.S. Bill has improve C‟w. relations: and little C‟w. objection. Can tighten up if we want to, by giving further Cat. C. vouchers.

M.Lab. Shd. stop non priority applications, from I. and Pak. at least, in near future. Cttee. will consider.

M.P. ?3 year moratorium on all coloured immign.

M.W.P.(D) C.P.(64)89 shd. be available to all Ministers – and perhaps more widely, before becomes election issue.

Ch.Sec. Health of dependants?

H.S. No medical examn. and H/C. wd. not have accepted at the time.

(Sick voucher holders schemes are rejected.)

Only admissions now are those requested by e.g. London Transport or those with some special skill. Otherwise down to 100 a week (plus dependants).

P.M. Leave alone till after election. But reconsider health check on depts.?

M.H. We need legn. and impose further delays.
