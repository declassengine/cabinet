C.C.(64)11 26 November 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P. As in statement.

2. Sir. W. Churchill. (oral)

P.M. Greeting for 90th birthday on 30 Nov. I may deliver personally.

3. Economic Situation. (oral)

P.M. Recent episode v. critical. Yesterday substantial reinforcement by 11 foreign banks, wh. provided not only necy. technical support but also evidence of intl. confidence in U.K.

Ch.Exch. No strings to aid. But still large sums of £ at risk. Therefore no case for slacking off: another “raid” in near future a possibility.

Hence must sell our proposals to foreign countries in terms which they will understand. Thus any defence economies must be presented as means of helping B/P. So must P.B.T.‟s pending statement on incentives.

So must any review of prestige projects. All must be shown as directed to releasing productive resources for more economic purposes.

All Ministerial speeches etc. in next fortnight should be directed to this aspect of sitn.

M.O.D. Need to plan ahead &amp; convince public opinion that we can‟t do everything in first year, if only because of congestion of leg. programme.

First Secy. First draft of this already sent to N.E.D.C.

M.P. Must relate steel nationalisation to export drive.

P.M. Watch speeches on ec. affairs: take lead from – or consult – First Secy. &amp; Ch. Exch. Ministers to advise junior Ministers accordingly.

First Secy. Don‟t emphasise steel too much: it frightens the foreigners.

P.M. Exports is right answer if question is raised. Otherwise, leave alone.

Ch.Exch. Agree. It is what foreigners think that matters. Don‟t crow over the “gnomes of Zurich” and blow up “vote of confidence” aspect. Emphasise basic fact that stable currency depends on strong economy; &amp; don‟t overplay the fact that weak economy is an inheritance from Tories.

M.Techy. And emphasise incomes policy less, and need for more prodn. more, as the remedy. Little faith in industry in incomes policy.

4. Oversea Affairs. (oral)

a) Congo

F.S. Dilemma. If we helped rescue, we risked stimulating massacre &amp; offending other African Govts. But need to save lives paramount. Therefore we contributed Ascension Island facilities. Essential secrecy leaked from Brussels. Therefore managed to preserve wireless silence during move from A. Island.

Operation saved lives: all U.K. subjects safe &amp; out (except one) and a lot of Asians (Indians &amp; Paks) – who shd. be less critical for that reason. Also providing help (supplies etc) to Africans in S‟ville – which shd. also take edge off African criticism, wh. has been v. sharp (apart from Nigeria) because they side with rebels.

All Belgian troops will be withdrawn to Belgium by early next week.

But they have made another drop – at Poulis – of wh. we did not know. Another legitimate rescue operation. Some scattered Europeans (including U.K. subjects) remain in remote bush.

b)

F.S. Germans may try to make some concessions to France in response to.

5. Defence &amp; Oversea Policy. (oral)

P.M. Chequers meeting. A review: no decisions. Two purposes – (i) general policy: and (ii) policy for W‟ton talks.

(i) The 3 roles. In total too heavy, if to be effective; and corresponding weapons systems too expensive. Main aircraft projects to be decided quickly, through normal channels. And something must be done to equalise burden wh. we carry E. of Suez on behalf of others. But must allow for political vulnerability of some bases – in conjunction with their essential purpose for discharge of our commitments and e.g. protection of Malaysia.

(ii) Begin with pressure on resources – underlined by recent events! Deal with vacuum in Europe – where everybody is waiting for U.K. initiative. We must still oppose mm. surface fleet. Return to Nassau base: must stop proliferation beyond two nuclear Powers, opportunity for which was lost at Nassau. Complicated by French force de frappe and its attraction to Germans. M.m. fleet intended to be counterpoise: but a military nonsense and politically unacceptable. Therefore we must provide altve.

Polaris subs to some extent committed beyond recall. Therefore use them but not as indept. U.K. dett. Hence project for ANF – our subs. with equal U.S. subs in a NATO force with U.S. &amp; U.K. veto. This shd. help to contain Eur. indept. aspirations, if we forego ours. U.K. manning of our subs still leaves us in a lead over Germany: can‟t help that.

No more fingers on trigger: otherwise set back to disarmt. and non- dissemn.

In return, ask for:-

a) early initiative to improve E-W relations.

b) avoid anything in W. Europe wh. wd. militate against this

c) minimise m.m. surface fleet. Try to avoid any contribn. at all – but reconsider if necy., provided U.S. veto retained &amp; no majority voting. Indept. Eur. force is main Soviet fear.

But may have to concede some other forms of m. manning, provided no more fingers on trigger.

Both political and technical control involve problems. But main purpose is to promote not only non-dissemn. but also non-acquisition by non-n. Powers and to try to get more consultation about world wide use of U.S. nuclear power. (Remember Cuba!)

F.S. U.S. already vexed at P.M.‟s public rejection (in defence debate) of m.m. surface fleet.

But mst deal with this.

Our main purpose is to prevent F-G nuclear alliance &amp; to produce project wh. France (post de G.) cd. enter.

On veto, U,S. maintain in private that they wd. always retain it. But they must say so publicly: and Eur. must forego “Eur. clause”.

Press for relaxn. in Europe – thinning out or whatever.

“ “ agt. n. powers won‟t disseminate and non-n. powers won‟t acquire.

S/S.D. Non-n. Europeans v. concerned about control of existing n. forces. Creation of another (M.L.F.) won‟t solve this; accelerates arms race: and puts further burdens on economy. Must solve problem with existing weapons, not by producing new ones.

Must also retain veto – otherwise dissemn.. But, if so, must let non – n. powers have veto over our n. force or contribn.

Must exact price – mainly our contribn. to NATO ground defence, since our main role shd. be peacekeeping E. of Suez.

P.M. If so, not unilaterally. S.U. must thin out too.

Value of E. &amp; S. role is that it enables us to play bigger part in U.N. peacekeeping.

M.H.L.G. Does A.N.F. role imply permanent U.N. role?

S/S.D. Polaris run to end of 70‟s. But manufacture of n. weapons systems shd. end by 1970. Consistent with our policy.

M.O.D. Must cancel such P. as are cuttable.

P.M. Yes. Even fifth sub. is at long lead order point: but these orders can be stopped and re-used. We shall end with a figure wh. wd. be viable only with U.S. – not viable on its own. But must allow margin for accidents – hence proposal for one in mothballs.

M.H.L.G. Shall we keep R. &amp; D. capacity for n. warheads?

S/S.D. Must consider: not yet committed. But no military fissile material for non-n. powers.

M.Techy. Merit of proposal is opportunity for reducing E.W. tension and opportunity for making more effective contribn. to global peace keeping.

L.P.S. Do C. of S. endorse policy?

P.M. Chequers unanimous about need for economy. And C. of S. v. willing to contribute.

S/S.D. Yes: great relief at prospect of coherent &amp; viable defence policy. And unity of view between F.O. &amp; My. of D. now restored.

P.M. Remember a multilateral force was in Nassau Agt.. Its transformation into an addl. m.m. s. fleet came later: we must try to reduce it if not to eliminate it.

M.O.D. But will A.N.F. be less provocative?

S/S.D. Yes – because M.L.F. wd. have been addl., whereas A.N.F. involves no new weapons. And because M.L.F. was always liable to become free of U.S. veto, wh. wd. have encouraged dissemn., whereas A.N.F. will involve reorgn. of control wh. will not involve dissemn. since existing n. powers will retain veto over use of bomb and over any change in control arrangements.

P.B.T. But France will then have greater control over her force than we over ours?

S/S.D. Must face this: but indept. Fr. deterrent doubtfully realistic in 5/10 years‟ time.

S/S.S. Polaris programme?

S/S.D. Two under active construction and beyond cancellation. For two others contracts placed and pre-fabrication started. For fifth no contract placed but some long lead items ordered – but cd. be diverted or cancelled.

S.S.S. If we divert the fifth, we can‟t be an indept. n. power, irrespective of success of A.N.F. project?

First Secy. Depends to some extent on number less than five wh. is credible.

P.M. S/S.D. will table proposals in due course.

Otherwise Cab. approve. [Enter Ch. Secy. Tsy.

6. Pensions of Ministers &amp; M.P.‟s. C.(64)17

L.P. Must adhere to Lawrence. But keep Members‟ Fund for benevolent purposes, until not required for new Members.

M.T. But watch implicns. for public service pensions on n. insurance benefits point.

Ch.Secy. Must accept Lawrence as a whole: otherwise each proposal can be criticised.

M.Techy. Even so, it will generate pressure for parity by public servants.

Ch.Duchy. Take account of it in basic review of N.I. benefits etc.

P.M. Agree with L.P.‟s recmns.

L.P. Ex officio pensions. a) Speaker: shd. be ½ L. recmns. but only after Resn. of House. Speaker agrees – wd. prefer to be fixed (with widow‟s pension if approved) at time of retirement. b) Lord Ch.: present occupant wd. prefer salary &amp; pension to be dealt with in judicial salaries Bill. c) P.M.: we propose payment direct from Exch. on basis of years of service. But this makes her poorer than Speaker‟s &amp; L.Ch.‟s widows.

P.M. L.Ch. is judge &amp; must be treated as such. Speaker also special.

But P.M. shd. be in same posn., qua widow, as if he had been an M.P.

L.P. That means £300.!

P.M. I will accept decision by L.P. &amp; Ch. Secy.

L.P. Lords‟ allce to be payable only to back-benchers, not Ministers.

Oppn. leader to have £2000: Oppn. Ch Whip £1500.

L.P.S. Ministers in Lords will be £1250 poorer than in Commons.

P.M. But can‟t pay expenses allce where there are no expenses.

L.P. Include Law Officers‟ salaries in Minl. Salaries Bill: not by Tsy. Minute.

2R of Bill &amp; Resn. on M.P.‟s pay can‟t be earlier on 18 Dec. But thereafter payment can be made retrospectively. [Exit C‟w. Secy.

Ch.Secy. If L.Ch. to wait for judges, no commitment to 1 April 1965.

L.Ch. I accept. [Exit Ch. Sec. Tsy.

7. Children‟s Services in Greater London. C.(64)20

L.P. Dilemma of the Skeffington pledge. Hence proposed compromise. No chance of agreement in necy. negotns. Hence Bill must be through by mid-March if services to operate on 1 April.

H.S. I agree. Final draft of Bill, taking account of views on our proposal, cdn‟t be ready before Recess. And, if enacted existing L.A. plans will have to be substantially modified. Bill therefore ought to be enacted early in ‟65, if admve. muddle to be avoided.

A good compromise: but scarcely worth it in view of timetable.

Ch.Exch. But larger homes can‟t be administered by single L.A.‟s. If we break them up, L.A.‟s will have to re-amalgamate them. Don‟t sacrifice interests of children to admve. difficulties. [Exit Ch.Exch.

L.Ch. I agree. Some boroughs have never dealt with children at all!

M.H.L.G. At least 3 weeks before end March are essential for laying of Orders etc. Arrangements on existing basis already made: and re-scrambling may be formidable. Only one Labour-controlled borough will object: but several Tory ones will.

Therefore I reluctantly vote against compromise.

Col.Sec. I support Ch. Exch. &amp; L. Ch. Skeffinton pledge was deliberate.
