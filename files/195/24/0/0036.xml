C.C.(64)8 12 November 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip.

L.P. As in statement.

2. Oversea Affairs. (oral)

a) Yemen

F.S. Settlement seems possible. If so, a concession by Nasser. Shall we then recognise Yemen? And at what price?

b) Sudan

F.S. Renewed riots – tho‟ not as anti-British as alleged. New Govt. trying to protect foreigners: no need to advise U.K. subjects to leave, since they can if want to.

c) Congo

F.S. Tshombe closing on remaining rebels in Stanleyville. How many white lives in power of rebels uncertain. Risk of massacre.

We are doing all we can to save them – Red Cross planes etc.

d) U.N.

F.S. Art.19 dispute. U.S. still refusing to increase normal contribn. unless S.U. pay arrears. We can‟t go as far: must continue to honour our commitments at pledging confce.. Avoid precise commitment, but undertake to give more than last time. [Enter Ch.Secy. Tsy.

3. Remuneration of Ministers and Members of Parliament.

C.(64)12&amp;14

L.P. As in memm. Endorse Lawrence Report – on merits and as precedent for future changes.

Accept proposals for M.P.s‟ pay – and revised travelling arrangements.

“ “ “ M.P.s‟ pensions – without means test.

Ministerial salaries: proposals too generous but base new votes on proposals abated.

Ditto for Speaker, Ch‟man &amp; D‟Ch‟man. etc.

Lords allowance: accept proposal for 4½ guineas. (Ministerial complication).

Oppn. posts: same principle of percentage increase.

M.Lab. M.P.s‟ pay o.k.: but 50% increase for Ministers incompatible with wages policy.

Ch.Exch. Even M.P.s‟ pay increase forthwith incompatible with deferment of N.I. increase until March. ? Only half now: balance in March.

Ch. Duchy. But Lawrence procedure is only means of escaping from perpetual problem of M.P.s‟ pay. Must accept result for M.P.s.

S/S.E.A. I agree – qua M.P.s.

M.A.F.F. And I. Real hardship among new Members already: and in this

Parliament back benchers will be abnormally hard pressed.

M.P. I agree. It represents an annual increase of 4% p.a. since last increase.

P.M. Must accept – retrospective to beginning of this Parlt. Watch presentation on expenses.

M.H.L.G. Pension scheme: must accept contriby. – but wrong in principle.

P.M. Must accept since salary based on assumpn. of contriby. scheme.

But details have still to be worked out.

S/S.W. ?Present contribn. as %age of salary.

F.S. Make date of effect coincide with N.I. increases.

P.M. Consider when drafting Bill.

On Ministers‟ salaries, remember we are legislating for a long time ahead. Therefore abatement shd. be voluntary self-denial, not statutory restriction. Consider 30% &amp; 40%.

Ch.Exch. No: go for 50% as in column (d).

M.O.D. 40% wd. be enough.

L.P.S. I agree.

C.S. But difference is marginal.

M.Techy. Consider right rate for the job. On this basis (d) not excessive.

Timing is different question.

L.Ch. I agree. In fact, Lawrence was right and (d) is too low.

P.M. Approve (d) - + £1250 – for senior Ministers, Ms. of S, Parly Secs., &amp; Whips.

S/S.E.A. And for P.M.?

P.M. But remember my higher starting point: and my £4000 allowance.

But I agree i.e. £14,000. Similarly for L.Ch. - £14,500.

In short, accept 50% cut on Lawrence recns.

S/S.S. Accept Lawrence on equality of Sol. Gen. &amp; Ld. Advocate?

S/S.E.A. But then must improve Sol. Gen Scot: and then moving away from Lawrence.

P.M. I agree: follow 50% of L. increase in all cases. On timing?

M.Lab. M.P.‟s forthwith. But Ministers shd. be wholly deferred for some months.

Ch.Exch. But exempt Parly. Secs. who shd. have some increase forthwith.

For other Ministers defer till next Parlt. – but accept M.P.‟s allowance forthwith.

P.M. Abnegation for whole life of Parlt. pretty stiff.

S/S. E.A. Fact of legn. is what does psychological damage. Nobody will believe we are not drawing pay. But we have got to legislate.

And we are facing new expenditures as senior Ministers.

Therefore confine self-denial to period coinciding with N.I. increase.

S/S.D. I agree. To cut by 50% - and to commit next Parlt. too – is too much.

L.P. Must legislate: and on pensions too. Therefore make effective date for salaries and pensions from 1 April – i.e. after N.I. increases.

P.M. Better to define as “until economic sitn. better”.

F.S. No: merely postpones real decision. Must fix a date now.

P.M. Legn. fixes effective date as forthwith. But leave period of voluntary denial imprecise.

S/S. E.A. No: that means that ec. crisis over when we end denial. And that wrecks incomes policy.

M.O.D. Therefore adopt Ch. Exch.‟s proposal – for whole Parlt. That is only real basis for new incomes policy.

S/S.S. No case for delay at all, especially if M.P.‟s are to get increase forthwith.

P.B.T. I support Ch. Exch.

M.H.L.G. No: don‟t underestimate effect of initial 50% cut. That produces what we believe to be right long term rate for job.

Postponement till April reasonable: but moral gesture thereafter wrong &amp; dangerous.

Ch.Duchy. I agree. The 50% cut was originally thought of as only for duration of ec. crisis. Now it is to be permanent. Don‟t make the gesture twice over.

L.Ch. I agree. Do it now – not for me, but only because I am a judge and judges have had no increase for 10 years.

M.Techy. Incomes policy is not incomes standstill. It is a controlled growth of

incomes. Therefore wait for only limited period – e.g. until 1 Nov, when import surcharge is to be reviewed.

Ch.Exch. No: moral gesture is worth something. Substantial deferment unnecessary.

S/S E.A. I agree. I can‟t deal with teachers‟ pay on any other basis.

L.P.S. I agree.

M.Lab. I too: it cd. have great impact on incomes policy.

S/S. W. I agree: incomes policy must have first priority.

H.S. I agree.

F.S. No: I side with S/S E.A. &amp; Ch. Duchy. The 50% cut is the real gesture. Second gesture of postponement will embarrass M.P.s

Therefore put definite – &amp; early date in Bill.

M.A.F.F. I agree.

Col.Sec. I too. It is legn. wh. will attract the odium. 1 April is latest reasonable date.

M.Power. I agree: otherwise wholly illogical.

M.Trans. I agree: remember the backlog. Therefore fix early date – 1 April or beginning of second Session.

C.Sec. No: strong case for no increase in Cabinet Ministers salaries.

Ch.Secy. Tsy. 1 April latest reasonable date.

Ch.Whip. Legislate forthwith: but ? voluntary abnegation – for life of this Parlt – by all Ministers above £3750.

P.M. Slight balance of view in favour of only short deferment. ?Settle for 1 April. The 50% cut is real gesture.

M.O.D. With individual abnegations?

P.M. Embarrassing.

L.P. Not if not publicised!

Ch.Exch. Then of no value! Can we compromise on beginning of next Session? i.e. November.

M.H.L.G. No – too risky.

P.M. Agree on 1 April – for everybody, even tho‟ no benefit at all till then for Lords Cm. of Tsy. in comparison with ordinary M.P.‟s.

Agree Speaker‟s allce. unchanged. Pension to be discussed.

P.M.‟s pension: settle for 50% increase.

Also for Ch‟man, Dy. Ch‟man &amp; Leader of Oppn.

4½ guineas for Members of Lords approved. Extension to Ministers to be further examined by L.P.‟s group: but v. difficult.

Oppn. Ch. Whip: proposal approved. (Watch repercussion on Leader of Oppn.; He shd. = M. of State: Oppn. Ch.Whip shd = Parly Sec.)

Lords L. of Oppn. &amp; Ch. Whip (Oppn.): case for payment in principle (provided no outside employment). Let L.P.‟s group consider.

[Exit Ch. Secy. Tsy.

Report to Oppn over weekend. Statement (L.P.‟s group to draft) to Oppn. on Monday when report published.

4. Import Charges. (oral)

S/S.E.A. Division in EDC about compensatory abolition of EFTA tariffs overtaken by French pressure in Group of Ten. But U.S or Germans wd. have applied same pressure. V. unfortunate – although result is what Ch. Exch. &amp; I favoured.

Must now mend EFTA fences: EDC to consider on Monday.

P.M. Don‟t let impression get about that we were snubbed or blackmailed by de Gaulle. I endorse action which was taken.

Ch.Exch. Confusion on Friday v. unfortunate. But we cdn‟t risk non-availability of support for £.

P.B.T. But great damage to EFTA – who can‟t understand why we let ourselves be blackmailed by French or denied access to I.M.F. wh. we are entitled to (on a gold basis).

Moreover pressure on £ on Friday came from France.

Must somehow restore EFTA confidence &amp; morale for next Minl. meeting.

P.M. Reconsider Cttee. procedure for this kind of decision – i.e. really major decisions on external economic issues.

F.S. I endorse action taken. Emphasise it was French pressure alone which precipitated sitn. [Exit S/S. E.A. : Ch. Exch.

5. Arms for S. Africa. (oral)

[Enter M. Avn.

P.M. Report result of D.O.P. discussion on export of arms to S.A. Identical with policy adopted by U.S. in fulfilment of U.N. resn. After notificn. of S. Africa and other Govts. concerned, decision will be announced rapidly. Announcement will have to say Bucaneers under examn.
