C.M.(64)44 30 July 1964. 10 a.m.

Land Values C.P.(64)159

M.H.L.G. Three steps: a) release more land, particuly. in crowded areas.

b) hypothecate revenue from tax to devt. and urban renewal.

c) differentiate regionally in weight of levy: high in S.E., low in country areas.

Base general statement on these points.

L.Ch. No: a tactical error. Remember W.S.C.‟s excess profits – wh. we had to enact and repeal!

Ultwatt wd. have recommended workable scheme, if it existed. What he did recommend failed.

Tax wd. inevitably turn into tax on all forms of capital apprecn. and will be seen as an electoral gimmick, wh. we shall regret if we win.

Ch.Exch. E.P.T. taxed excess profits: land values at present pay no tax at all, despite monopoly posn. of developer. In equity, some charge is unanswerable – as a fee for a franchise, not a tax. Earlier efforts have failed because level was too high. Agree difficult to find levels wh. wd. not prevent land being released but wd. be politically defensible. Therefore I favour moderate charge, not specified in advance, and related to change of use or planning permission is given.

C.S. I agree. Fair and politically wise.

S/S.I. Will it catch all cases?

Ch.Exch. If expressed as “wherever planning permission for devt. is given”.

S/S.E.S. If taxn. to be increased anyhow, foolish to overlook this possibility.

But? unwise to say so now. Still more unwise to use conventional jargon about “betterment” etc, when our worst risk is to appear to reverse all our previous policy.

L.Ch. But beware of precedent for full scale c.g. tax.

M.P.B.W. I agree with L.Ch. And it would increase price of land.

Even Socialist Govts. abroad have not adopted this method.

M.A.F.F. It wd. lead to a universal c.g. tax.

Ch.Duchy. And it wd. be regarded as a tax, not a franchise charge.

P.M. Seen younger M.P.‟s. Majority against this.

Ch.Duchy. In spite of this issue our national support is growing. Don‟t risk it

afresh by this.

Ch.Sec. But popular resentment at “injustice”. How do we defend this?

P.M. By saying that, if a tax, must not increase price: and nobody can find it.

L.P.S. C.g. tax may be inevitable if inflation goes on. But don‟t get drawn into major political change at this moment and in this way.

P.M. I agree.

M/S E.S. Progressive opinion wants us to do something. Can we leave the general impression that we wd. certainly consider this if somebody cd. find a way. Perhaps relate to general need for widening of tax base.

M.H.L.G. No: wd. frighten everybody!

H.S. Some general refce. to “substantial untaxed profits”?

Ch.Exch. Only with greatest care in wording.

P.M. Make clear that this tax wdn‟t do any good qua housing. Shift to taxn generally.

And emphasise M.H.L.G.‟s new point – more release of land.

M.H.L.G. Yes – at expense of increasing congestion in S.E.!

Beware of widening issue far more than I contemplated.

S/S.E.S. And of trying to tax a capital asset rather than money. We abolished Sch. A. because of this anomaly: don‟t create another.

Ch.Exch. Might find some way of presenting it without implicn. of general c.g. tax.

M.W.P.(D) Must be vague on general fiscal issue. Separate point is that this specific tax wd. not secure release of more land but simply increase its price.

P.M. Ch.Exch.: M.H.L.G. : M.W.P.(D) to draft formula – to be incorporated in speech by Ch. Exch, to wh. all candidates can refer.

Ch.Exch. But public opinion – of all shades – will remain dissatisfied.

2. C‟wealth Immigration. (oral)

H.S. Coloured immigration too high. Cttee. have commissioned further study of possible measures. No action before Election: but may have

to be ready to say something in Septr, indicating that we will confine inflow to what country can absorb. (It is considerably higher than this - at 68.000 a year last year – now).

C.S. We shd. do more now: we have already created a colour problem.

P.M. H.S. &amp; C.S. to draft formula for considn. But weigh social disadvantages against economic benefits.
