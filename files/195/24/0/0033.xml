C.C.(64)5 3 November 1964. 10 a.m.

1. Ministerial Broadcasts. (oral)

P.M. Watch M‟ial. b‟casts: Oppn. may claim right of reply even to non- controversial programmes.

News programmes: notify my office in all cases.

Exclude debates with Oppn.: &amp; watch “question” type of interview – which may go further than would be permitted in Parliament.

Re-emphasise secrecy of Cab. discussions.

2. Office Building. C.(64)10 [Enter M.P.B.W. : M/S. :

B/T. (Darling)

S/S.E.A. Action on domestic front important to balance action on W/p. Little “Neddies”, regional planning etc. in hand: but will take time. Some immediate action to correct domestic imbalance required: restriction of office building, particularly in London, is most appropriate.

?By long-term measures: or quick action even if rough &amp; ready. Latter best; stop even tho‟ planning permission already given.

I.D.C. machinery most effective instrument, by extension from industrial building: i.e. where no contract signed, no building after 6 Nov. without I.D.C.

Compensation? Wd. be v. expensive (?£100m). Therefore refuse, on grounds of temporary measure, wh. may be removed later.

M.H.L.G. 21 m sq. ft. still in pipeline. Therefore must stop it. Must apply to all types of office bldg.: but must have lower (i.e. exemption) limit.

On presentation, make v. clear about Metropolitan area and contiguous conurbation.

M.P.B.W. Must emphasise no interference with bldg. industry, who are v. sensitive to stop – go techniques: i.e. redistribution, not reduction, of demand.

Govt. must keep in line as regards own office bldg.

M/S. B/T. Agree throughout. Compensn. might be £150m. Therefore can‟t afford. ?Announce on 5 Nov. – to be immediately operative (to prevent rush forestalling).

Tax on London office bldg. may be right long-term answer.

Ch.Exch. If say “temporary”, increase demand for compensn. if permission finally refused. (Even 50% might mean £100m). Therefore refuse compensn. outright on principle. [Exit L.P.S.

P.M. Immediate standstill can be temporary (on grounds of resources): longer – term control shd. be permanent. Distinguish these. No case for compensn. for speculators: and remember profit (i.e. scarcity value) wh. will accrue to those who have already built.

M.Tech. Evidence of past favouritism for devt. companies as against L.A. bldg.

M.O.D. ?Use Land Commission to deal with any “injustice”.

M.H.L.G. Can‟t provide for hard cases at all.

S/S E.S. I agree. Must deal with London problem: standstill &amp; no compensn.

S/S.S. Also emphasise need to spread office bldg. to rest of country.

Ch. Exch. shd. consider inducements for this.

[Exit L.Ch.

Ch.Whip. If a Bill for this, something else must go.

S/S. E.A. Even if I rush it through immediately?

P.M. Policy approved: no compensn.: redraft statement to deal with temporary point. Watch forestalling on date of announcement.

[Exit M. Tech.

3. Debate on Address. (oral)

Ch.Whip. Oppn. want Ec. Affairs on Wed. Must resist – Thurs. better.

“ “ Techy. on Thurs: nonsense.

P.M. Ch.Duchy to open on Wedy.: M.P.N.I. to wind up.

Ec. debate on Thursday.

?O‟seas affairs on Friday, with minimum refce to defence until we have re-shaped defence policy. If Friday.

4. School of Building Survey. (oral)

S/S E.S. Have seen report: can publish forthwith. But questionnaire irrelevant and publicn. wd. have to be accompanied by lot of explanation.

Est of £1300m. to remedy defects unrealistic, since problems wd. have altered while it was being spent. And we shd. be asked if we were going to spend £1300 m! 1965-66 programme of school bldg. is £80 m. - £50 m. for increase in numbers and £30m. for defects. Can‟t yet promise to increase latter, as we ought to. Therefore defer publicn. (if politically possible). Otherwise publish defects, without est. of cost.

P.M. If publish immediately, clearly a Consve. responsy. ?Omit cost.

F.S. No: publish whole thing.

P.M. Publish survey: consider, when published, form of commentary. S.S.I. shd. consider this.
