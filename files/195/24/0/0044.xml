C.C.(64)16 18 December 1964. 10 a.m. H/C.

1. Rents Bill. C.(64)30

M.H.L.G. Committed to repeal but not to status quo, wh. wd. have meant precise

formula related to rateable value. New system required as in memm.

More flexible and based on security of tenure restored in full. But

Tribunals inadequate – something more required by way of rent regulation.

Hence – full security of tenure: rent freeze: new element of conciliation (rent officer) before Tribunal, (now to be called Rent Assessment Cttee.).

This excludes L.A. tenants, Crown tenants, service tenants. For these too, there must be basic protection – adequate notice, court order etc. If L.A.‟s are to agree, must be universal.

Rules for fixing fair rent: difficult. Must include some weighting for rateable value.

Selection of rent officers: L.A.‟s divided – some wish to appoint them.

But they wd. certainly lend personnel.

Furnished dwellings: M – Holland will show worst scandals here. But reasonable lettings must continue. Must therefore devise formula to catch bad landlord. V. difficult: may not find it.

F.S. Must protect members of oversea depts. who are posted abroad &amp; let their houses.

C.S. Yes: Staff side have raised. Pl associate us with drafting.

L.Ch. If we have to go to a court, that will be enough protection for good landlord.

M.H.L.G. Leave furnished lettings as they are unless I have to come back to Cab.

S/S.D. Same problem for Service personnel sent abroad.

M/S. B/T. Also for business men in export campaigns.

M.O.D. Rights of good landlord against bad tenant?

M.H.L.G. Covered by existing Rent Act.

S/S.E.S. £400 in London but only £200 outside. Too great a disparity?

M.H.L.G. £400 may be £50 too high. But will check. Note misprint in 6(i).

Service tenancies: see para 12 – can‟t give more than basic rights, i.e. security against eviction.

M.A.F.F. Not enough for agricl. tied cottages. We are pledged to find altve. accmn.

Must be ready to discuss further with agricl. workers.

L.P. But watch agricl. labourer who uses tied cottage to queue-jump on Council Housing lists.

M.H.L.G. I agree: can‟t give accmn guarantee, wh. is legal incentive to humane owner to evict in order to get tenant a Council house.

First Secy. But must deal with chap who is evicted without altve. accmn.

P.M. M.H.L.G. to discuss further with M.A.F.F. &amp; M.P. &amp; report to L.P.‟s Cttee.

S/S. E.S. Para 3 insufficiently precise as guidance to rent officers. ? Better to give them discretion within certain limits by refce. to gross values.

M.H.L.G. I agree. But scheme must be flexible: and all experts argue against definite link with some standard such as rateable value. Therefore admit it as one element only. Only ultimate cure is more houses.

Valn. discrepancies between individual houses &amp; areas are inescapable; only v. accurate reassessment wd. cure this. Better to trust rent officers.

M.O.D. They may be v. subjective.

M.H.L.G. Rules of thumb will soon be established. And other factors – e.g. physical condition of houses – can be established objectively.

Ch.Duchy. Must allow for return on capital. New house may rightly command higher rent than old house. Therefore must be flexible: and rents mustn‟t be driven unduly low.

S/S.S. Then must stipulate reasonable amount to be spent on repairs.

L.Ch. Criteria of fair rent want much more work. And quality of personnel v. important.

M.H.L.C. L.A.‟s willingness to second will be v. helpful.

P.M. Accept flexibility: r. value one element: rent officers &amp; assessment cttees : L.P.‟s cttee. to consider whether rent officers shd. be servants of L.A.‟s.

S/S.S. Can probably adapt to Scot.: will pursue in L.P.‟s Cttee.

[Exeunt L.P. : Ch. Duchy : A.G.

2. Oversea Affairs. (oral)

a) NATO Council Meeting

F.S. Talk with Couve. de Gaulle welcomes P.M.‟s visit. Tried to mend fences with France, particy. on ANF. But he stressed their concept of Alliance different.

NATO no more attractive even if ANF and MLF abandoned; admitted France may have no altve. to pulling out of NATO in one way or another: feared no soln. of G. problem, wh. we must leave alone: Fr. about to introduce selective service – but have reduced Army for economic reasons.

In NATO Council, we did well. Great interest in our ideas – by both U.S. &amp; Germany, both of whom are slowing momentum. We need not therefore drag our feet.

Fr. accuse us of dividing Alliance: Spaak backs them: also Canada for sake of Quebec. Must therefore emphasise unifying aspect of our proposals.

b) Congo

Sitn. still bad. Above 27 U.K. citizens &amp; 3 other Br. subjects (?Asian) still in rebel territory. Tshombe‟s columns slowing up. OAU initiative petered out.

U.N. initiative not on. We are doing our best: but Fr. &amp; Belg. won‟t try to persuade Tsh. to broaden his Govt., wh. is only soln. We must not get too involved – or we shall be asked to pay.

Prospects for U.K. hostages therefore not good: we can‟t do more.

[Exit M.P.

c) NATO Council Meeting

S/S.D. I persuaded Couve to agree U.S. deterrent still valid for NATO. But Rusk reports his talk with de G. who said Fr. if pushed, wd. leave NATO but not Alliance. Means? Everybody (except Germans) now prefers ANF to MLF: but I persuaded von Hassel U.K. wd. not enter MLF.

They wd. accept our retaining some nuclear capability outside Europe.

Force goals unrealistic – 800,000 extra men! Macnamara and I opposed: hope military will be more realistic . Mac. said U.S. now committing ¼ of resources to Eur. protection: and Eur. fatalities in nuclear war wd. be enormous. I emphasised folly of envisaging war of 90 days after nuclear exchange.

ANF is now only runner: even tho‟ issue may not be forced until after G. election. And clearly understood that, even if MLF element, we are not joining. Only Schroder still wants real U.K. contribn.

[Exit M.H.L.G.

3. Trade Disputes Bill. C.(64)29 [Re-enter A.G.

M.Lab. As in memm. T. of R. of enquiry still in dispute. Unions wd. favour a R.Cmn.

On T. of R. T.U.C. want v. general phrasing; and (a) &amp; (b) omitted!

Cmn. shd. be independent – no repve. members, who wd. simply produce a divided report.

L.Ch. Bill is all right. But retrospection (right) may make it a hybrid.

Does no more than restore status quo.

A.G. Must consider language of Bill v. carefully. I will discuss with M. Lab and examine hybrid aspect.

M.Tech. Watch outstanding cases, if to be settled under obscure existing law.

L.Ch. Must limit degree of retrospection. Normally, law that applies is law that obtained when course of action arose.

First Secy. But that is designed to protect people who act in good faith. In this case it will protect wrong people.

F.S. Cd. we stipulate decision to be in substance according to new law, costs being adjusted if damage?

P.M. And proposal is incentive to people to issue writs before Bill enacted.

Retrospect to introdn. of legn.

A.G. Risk v. small: and a bad principle.

L.Ch. Not only a qun of costs: retrospecn. may put original actions in jeopardy.

F.S. But still retrospect to introdn. of Bill.

L.Ch. Any retrospecn. may make it hybrid.

P.M. Clarify this first and report to Cab. at that point.

H.S. On Finance Bills accepted legn. can be retrospective if warning given.

Give warning here – perhaps in Bill itself.

P.M. On enquiry?

Ch.Exch. On T. of R., why “to report” rather than “make recmns.”?

M.Lab. I wd. prefer “recmns.”. But, if we are driven to repve. members, danger of a split report.

On “relations”, Cmn. must decide whether to consider firm by firm or industry by industry.

P.M. No public refce. to R. Cmn. until Queen has approved.

Ch.Exch. But does (a) cover only those aspects of management/employer relationship which are matters of associations – i.e. negotiations. Wider aspects - e.g. wildcat employer – shd. be covered.

M. Lab. They are. But must be made clear. L.Ch. Ch. Exch. M. Lab etc. to consider.

First Secy. But I want an enquiry into relations of assocns. – not into industrial relations as a whole.

P.M. But must include wild cat employer e.g. in motor car trade.

Ch.Exch. I agree: they must be included.

M.Tech. Shd. cover indl. relns. as a whole. [Exit C.S.

M. Lab. I agree. You can‟t really separate the two quns: must include “non recogn.” areas.

P.M. L. Ch. to discuss T. of R. with M. Lab &amp; report to Cab. Since T.U.C. want a wide enquiry, we must make T. of R. fit this.

H.S. I will consult M. Lab on N.I. aspects.
