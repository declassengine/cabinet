C.C.(65)1 14 January 1965. 10 a.m.

1. Oversea Affairs. (oral)

a) U.A.R.

F.S. I have discussed with Amb. better relations. Slight improvement: but U.A.R. pressure on Aden remains. I have said our relations with Israel must not be harmed. I have offered a minl. visit to Cairo to pursue discussions.

U.A.R. in trouble in Yemen: 50.000 troops engaged: Rep. regime v. rocky.

Also domestic problems. Therefore wait for Nasser to make next move.

b) Indonesia

F.S. Considerable I. reinforcements in Borneo. Ours ditto: we can probably cope.

Sukarno v. ill. P.K.I. position is succession struggle improving, tho‟ Army cd. hold them. If S. lives, Commt. influence will grow

Next stages in S. Council under discussion with U.S.A.

2. Commercial Policy. (oral)

P.M. Chequers meeting on exports at week-end. Nothing in package to offend EFTA etc. But they shd. be told in advance. But not too early – Monday in time for C‟wealth: perhaps earlier for EFTA – but decide at Chequers.

3. Casement. (oral)

H.S. Irish pressing for return of his remains. F.S. &amp; CS. endorse my view we shd. agree. No legal objections. N.I. fear might provoke disturbances – especially since C. wished to be buried in N.I. We must therefore stipulate burial in Eire &amp; no removal. This wd. satisfy N.I. Eire must also accept whatever remains are found.

Repercussions on Evans case. Might concede if Silverman Bill passes.

Announce decision in H/C. at right time.

P.M. Agreed.

4. Children‟s Service in Greater London. C(65)3

[Enter M.T. : Ch. Secy. Tsy.

H.S. As in memm. Oppn. by boroughs growing.

L.P. Yes – more than we thought at earlier discussion. Nobody really wants this.

Also Bill wd. be v. controversial: also subsequent Orders on property and compensation etc. Therefore drop it.

L.Ch. But those who know about Service support it. Boroughs have no

personal experience of it: and their oppn. is uninformed. No risk of compensn. involved – same people will do job.

S/S.E.S. I agree.

M.H.L.G. Not so sure. In principle I agree: but in practice oppn. is growing and it may be sensible now to go ahead on basis for which plans are already well advanced. Can‟t risk jam on timetable which must be completed by 1 April.

P.B.T. But on merits our own proposals right.

Ch.Duchy. Issue is of admn., not principle. I support L.P.

L.P.S. I support L. Ch.

P.M. But Parly. problem may be v. serious. Don‟t give Oppn. chance to obstruct steel and land Bills – unless we guillotine, wh. wd. be odious in this case and in any case wd. not be possible in Lords.

Ch.Whip. Mid-Feb is earliest date for Lords: and obstruction cd. delay still further. If so, rest of programme wd. suffer.

P.M. On balance accept L.P.‟s view. H.A.C. to consider possible statement on changes in constn. etc.: and support arrangements for improved liaison – joint cttees. etc.

5. Postal Tariffs. C.(65)1 [Enter P.M.G.

P.M.G. As in memm. An inherited problem: no altve.

M.Tech. Maybe. But - if real problem – better to absorb price increases by greater productivity &amp; efficiency.

P.M.G. No: loss (£119m. over 5 years) too great to be met by borrowing, if normal commercial principles are to be observed. Some scope for short term prody. benefits possible: but main scope only in longer term.

Can‟t absorb 8% target: service is buoyant.

Cross subsidy from telen. out: they need modernisation themselves.

Cut in services can‟t cover £37m. (already reduced from £45m.).

Even 4d. letter: underpriced on intl. comparisons.

Modernisation means investt., wh. means borrowing, wh. can‟t be done on basis of losses.

P.M. See para 9: need we cover past losses, as distinct from inherited deficit in ‟65-‟66.

M.Tech. And increase in parcels charge will lose traffic – by diversion to more efficient systems of distribn.

S/S.S. I agree.

M.A.F.F. Announcement wd. be disastrous at this moment in price stabilisation campaign.

M/S. DEA Point already taken by redn. in G.P.O.‟s original demands and increased emphasis on modernn.. But no announcement at this moment.

And present shd. therefore reverse order – we shall modernise and only in light of that put up prices to meet remaining deficit.

P.B.T. I support P.M.G. Must have coinage to enable G.P.O. to pay its way.

S/S.D. Must we engage U.S. consultants?

P.M.G. They are the best – DEA agree.

On main issue, services are absolutely under priced. And arrears of wage adjustment are involved. But, if we accept comparability in wages, we must do so in prices. We will emphasise modernn.: but resultant investt. can‟t be justified on basis of losses.

L.Ch. Why consider activities separately? A profit in prospect, overall, over next five years: and 8% target a Tory choice, not ours.

Ch.Duchy. Assumptions in para 2 wrong. Wages will be higher – both for postmen (by P.R.V.) and for engineers (by wage drift). Action overdue. Modernn. not a complete answer.

Ch.Secy. To duck the last two years assumes an annual accounting period.

But five years is right period for G.P.O. We must make this publicly clear.

Analogy with private industry inaccurate: question is whether user not taxpayer pays. This Govt. has endorsed the 8% target. Therefore announce as soon as politically realistic.

P.M. Use this chance to provide envelopes of standard size?

P.M.G. Not yet ready to move into stationery trade. But working towards it.

P.M. Concede proposals in principle. But timing shd. be discussed with First Secy., Ch. Exch. &amp; P.M.G. (and myself) in relation to price stability campaign.

M.Tech. If issue is really 3d. or 4d. letter rate, deal with that. But no case for increasing parcels by 9d.: we wd. never concede that to a private handler.

P.M.G. But must keep relativities between different elements of letter and parcel services.

P.M. Nevertheless, re-examine parcels: leave decision to the four Ministers.

M.P. I support P.M.G. Maintenance of 8% target important for other natd. industries; if we are to avoid subsidies, must face some price increases.

P.M. Leave to four Ministers: also reconsider names of consultants.

[Exeunt Ch. Secy. Tsy : M/S. DEA : P.M.G.

6. Trade Unions and Employers‟ Associations. C.(65)2

[Enter A.G.

M.Lab. As in memm. Productivity is implicit: unions wd oppose any formula wh. made it explicit.

P.M. Substitute “accelerating”.

M.Lab. I agree.

Chairman shd. be a Judge.

L.Ch. I don‟t dissent. But pressure of proper work already heavy on judges.

Therefore, if I agree here, I may have to ask for more judges!

H.S. N.I. concerned: statement shd. make it clear that they will be associated with work of N.I.

M.Tech. But they excluded themselves from the 1906 Act.

H.S. Even so, they agree subject matter of common concern to all parts of U.K.
