C.C.(64)14 11 December 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Aden. (oral).

Col. S. My visit intended to create right sort of pol. atmosphere: base only secondary, in intention and in fact.

Rulers initially suspicious of Labour Govt: but I dispelled these in course of tour of Protectorate and discussions with repve leaders and &amp; detainees.

I reaffirmed 1968 indepce. target and aid meanwhile. On last day we got joint decln. of Aden &amp; Fedl. Govts, setting unitary state as objective with code of human rights. Constl. confce. in March: we will give them list of ques. to be solved before unitary state possible. I will explore particular aspects with S/S Def. MOD etc.

[Exit Col.Sec.

2. Washington Discussions. (oral)

P.M. V. friendly - cordial: no U.S. arm-twisting. Recgn. of our world wide role: and emphasis on prevention of proliferation and new disarmt. initiative.

Also recogn. of need to lighten burden on economy. Thanked L.B.J. for U.S. recent help: he thanked us for our consultn. with U.S., and wants intimate collabn. at official level. He promised us all possible aid. We described our measures to strengthen economy &amp; promote exports.

They want redn. in defence expre. as much as we do: hence refce. in communiqué for closer collabn. in defence R&amp;D and weapons production, in order to release resources for civil output.

On Europe, objectives agreed. On means MLF still alive: but U.S. v. ready to consider our proposals. They want a m.m.s.f. element in ANF and us to contribute. But we reserved our posn. and got undertaking on U.S. veto as a permanency – i.e. not only no more fingers on trigger but nobody can push U.S. finger off it.

This mix must now be pursued with allies: and all will depend on (divided) German reaction. But – tho‟ we can‟t say so publicly – MLF is probably on way out. We are free now to publish our proposals in H/C: and with luck, decision may be postponed till after G. election.

U.S. also alive to risks of proliferation outside Europe – e.g. India in light of Chinese detonation. New concept of Pacific “ANF”: if India became nuclear power, we shd. be beyond point of no return.

We rejected U.S. pressure for U.K. presence in S.V-Nam and promised only strengthening of training, police forces., Thompson mission etc. We emphasised our contribn. in Malaysia, and warned against embarrassing us as co-chairman of ‟54 Confce.

On B.G. I told U.S. of warning I had given to Japan – no indepce., whoever won the election, until both communities cd. live together. U.S. think too highly of Burnham: we corrected them &amp; reaffirmed our policy.

General agt. on further stages in process of continuing consultn.:

another visit to U.S. (also for U.N.) may be necy. early in ‟65. Note last para of communiqué. – i.e. our right to a ticket to any top-level discussn.

F.S. L.B.J. not wholly sold on M.LF: but U.S. now divided among themselves. Also can‟t be too open about veto at this stage. But intention of communiqué is clear. German reaction unpredictable. de G, can force a split in C.D.U. on this issue: and G. may therefore want to postpone decision till after election. Will explore with Schroeder today.

U.S. tho‟ still wanting m.m.s.f. element are content to express this as their view and to leave G. to decide for themselves.

Must now contemplate multilateral discussns. at official level – probably in Paris – in wh. our project must figure prominently.

Canada unduly frightened, qua Quebec, of de Gaulle.

S/S.D. Good discussions with Macnamara. Rapid follow up of co-opn. on R&amp;D. etc. now arranged. He said Congress wdn‟t accept any NATO nuclear forces of wh. U.K. is not a member (including m.m.s.f. element).

Ch.Exch. Where is the economy?

F.S. We set framework for exploration of this.

P.M. And in long-term, joint R&amp;D &amp; prodn., together with examn. of costs of our o‟sea bases, shd. help. On Germany, we did not propose any specific cuts: but they themselves want to reduce, subject to German susceptibilities, and we cd. then follow as part of general E-H thinning out and perhaps some new approach to German unity.

S/S.D. Real savings shd. be possible within present weapons plans and also by logistic support. Official discussns. can pave way for Minl. talks early in ‟65.

Ch.Exch. German costs last year £70m – offset by £50m = £20m) increase as

“ “ next “ £85 m - “ “ £20m = £65m )result of

July agt.

S/S.D. We may be asked at NATO to increase our contribn. in Europe. I agreed with Mac. that we wd. both oppose.

M.Techy. I will keep in touch with U.S. thinking. If we are to do anything, we must have enough money to do it. [Re-enter Col. Sec.

M.P. Watch risk of encouraging brain drain by curtailing our own R&amp;D.

Can we use top table sentence to debunk Tory claim that top-table seat depends on indept. dett.?

P.M. Certainly: I will do so in debate.

On design etc., our own review will cut: co-opn. will help to keep design teams in being.

P.B.T. China more violent on V.N. than on Formosa Essential we shd. not get involved, particularly since V.C. are losing.

F.S. I emphasised risks of embarrassing us as co-chairman.

M.H.L.G. Was it assumed our E.of S. role wd. continue?

P.M. Bases may not always be available: but U.K. capacity to maintain peace &amp; stability, by whatever means are appropriate, v. important in U.S. eyes.

S/S.D. And capacity depends largely on bases. U.S. regard it outside Europe as more important than inside Europe; and might even agree our forces in G. as a flexible str. reserve.

P.M. And U.S. more aware of our role as leader of C‟wealth.

F.S. We reaffirmed our policy on China. And Canada will vote against for last time this year.

My talk with Gromyko – as usual. But he was cordial and looking for co-opn., even tho‟ opposed to ANF

P.M. Canadian visit v. successful. Meeting with Cabinet. They are preoccupied, via Quebec, with Fr. reactions. They will examine ANF: posn of 6 RCAF squadrons. Alive to Chinese threat &amp; wd. favour nuclear interdependence in F.E. Br. exports v. bad: Trade Commissioners will report – must follow up.

3. S. Rhodesia. C.(64)25

C.S. As in memm. If Smith won‟t come to London before end of year, we will announce Mission.

P.M. Keep open possy. of C‟w represen.? First bid, wh. we can narrow down if Smith rejects.

C.S. Reverse: if he rejects U.K. Mission, revert to Cw. mission. If he rejects that too, he is clearly in wrong.

M.O.D. Must insist beforehand on access to anybody.

C.S. Wait till request is refused?

Ch.Exch. I agree. Get Mission there first - and let them insist.

Any value in one Lib?

S/S.W. Note Kenya precedent: no conditions – and no difficulty when they got

there!

P.M. Start like this – as regards both T. of R. &amp; access. Smith won‟t accept!

L.P. But T. of R. shd. be at least as for Kenya.

C.S. No: leave alone.

P.M. Wait for H. Com. report after return to Salisbury. Then consider further.
