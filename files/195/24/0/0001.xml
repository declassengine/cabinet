C.M.(64)21 9 April 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

M.W.P.(D) Propose to write to BBC and ITA on clarification of minl. appearances on T.V. We are losing at present. Must now get out of electioneering period.

S/S.D. But clarificn. will be to advantage of Oppn.

P.M. Discuss with them, rather than write?

M.T. Leave it to them to take initiative.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Cyprus

F.S. Want to publish directive to U.N. troops. If Sec. Gen. won‟t agree. I must say directive empowers our troops to defend selves and to use force in discharge of their mission. To publish might alienate Gk. Cyp. sympathy.

C.S. Might also make them beware of misbehaving.

S/S.D. No. It wd. merely lead to pressure for amdt. wh. wd. weaken protection for our troops. It wd. have to be negotiated.

P.M. But, if published, S. Gen. cdn‟t go back on it.

F.S. S.Genl. wd. agree d. might be shown to M.P.‟s, provided not published in Press.

C.S. Or repeat F.S.‟s oral statement, and say have confirmed with Sec. Genl.

Or show privately to H. Wilson.

L.Ch. Resist publicn. on grounds of precedent for opl. order.

P.M. Consider when we have text of “orgl. procedures 31/3”. Meanwhile, I will speak to H.W.

F.S. S. Genl. offers to reduce our troops to 2000 vice 3000.

S/S.D. Agree, provided remnant is viable. Check this before accepting; and get Gyoni‟s plan.

b) Yemen

F.S. Can‟t improve S.C. resn. on Harib incident amended any further.

“Deploring Br. action” remains. Dean advises against veto: we shd.

abstain with suitable statement. May get necy. 7 member support, (? including U.S.).

C.S. U.S. attitude deplorable: cf. their attitude over Cuba.

May have to abstain, tho‟ v. regrettable. ?Abstain only if U.S. abstain; otherwise veto. At least a v. firm statement, emphasising defensive, not retaliatory, nature of action and stressing that, if any reoccurrence, we will take issue to S.C. and, if they can‟t guarantee protection we reserve right to take our own steps. Essential to maintain local morale.

L.Ch. Vote against it, instead of vetoing?

F.S. As party to dispute, we can‟t vote. But make statement, emphasising our treaty obligns.. Important, in view of criticism by Kuwait, Libya, Iraq etc.

P.M. Watch reaction of Libya and Kuwait, if we vetoed.

S/S.D. Watch also reaction in U.K. if U.S. vote for resn.! They are always pressing us to hold Aden: and there is no other way of doing it. ?Unwise to involve S.C. in future incidents.

F.S. No: that is main ground of charge against us.

P.M. F.S. shd. warn Rusk that U.S. must support us. If not, I will send message to Prest.

L.Ch. Important, qua U.K. public opinion, to publicise reasons for Harib attack.

S/S.D. They were conclusive – long provocation: need for deterrent: prior warning by leaflet: and many earlier representations to Prest. of S.C. in relation to previous incidents.

P.M. All derives from U.S. policy towards U.A.R. It may be enabling Nasser to squeeze us out of Aden and Libya.

C.S. Tell U.S. their policy has failed. It hasn‟t prevented increase of U.A.R. troops in Yemen.

M.A.F.F. Then get them out by fresh initiative against U.A.R. in U.N.

L.P.S. But we shd. be voted down.

P.M. F.S. shd. nevertheless consider it. Meanwhile proceed as he proposes. F.S. and C.S. shd. co-ordinate publicity in U.K. Press.

3. S.Rhodesia. (oral)

C.S. Bill to amend S.Rh. constn. as result of dissoln. of Fedn. O.K. But

watch posn. of Cl. Council. New Bill will make Fedn. laws S. Rh. laws. Some are discriminatory. S. Rh. will try to exclude them from C.C. (as S. Rh. domestic legn. is not). I propose to agree, since no change in existing posn. But W. Field has undertaken to reconsider when next opportunity arises. Don‟t have a row now on marginal issue, when Bill has already passed.

Rumours that W.F. may soon resign.

[Exit F.S. : S/S.D. : C.S.

4. Zanzibar. (oral)

C.S. Z. drifting into Comm. camp. Arms and money going in. We are watching closely. So are E.A. Govts. who are inviting Karume to attend their meeting of Heads of Govt.

5. Prospects for Taxation 1964-67. C.P.(64)65. [Enter M.P.N.I.

Ch.Exch. As in memm. Logical consequence of our expre. decisions.

L.Ch. V. depressing for those on fixed incomes.

M.P. Indirect taxn. better than direct. Start with oil.

M.A.F.F. Para 13 – foodstuffs. We saved £50m. last year on g.subsidies by higher prices. Better than taxing foodstuffs. But some Tsy. thinking is opposed to price rises. Can‟t have it both ways.

Ch.Exch. I am thinking only of “luxury” foodstuffs.

L.P. ?More resource into capacity of taxn. base.

M.A.F.F. Ests. timetable is impediment. I cd. now budget for rather less.

Ch.Exch. But others have gone up!

Defence expre. is rising v. fast. But how curtail it.

P.M. It wd. mean eg. eliminating F.E. commitment. But what about our treaty with Malaysia.

M.H. ?Circulate to Cab. note on long-term possibilities of new or varied taxn.

P.M. Yes – at leisure – in both E.P.C. and Cab. And bring forward again the public investt. programme issues (incl. univs.)

6. Pensions and National Insurance. C.P.(64)83

Ch.Exch. Decisions less urgent now election deferred.

Cttee. favoured diffl. benefits. Divided on war benefits. Also on timing.

P.M. Defer discussn. and circulate some of Cttee.‟s papers as background.

Cab. on Thursday.

[Exit M.P.N.I.

7. Postmen‟s Pay. C.P.(64)85 [Enter P.M.G.

P.M.G. As in memo. Announce restrictions on Monday.

Publicn. of report on London busmen and decision to remit elecy. dispute to indept. enquiry have weakened our hands. But can‟t depart from established procedure for civil servants.

L.Ch. Bill of Indemnity v. awkward. ?Consult Law Officers urgently on alterve.

Ch.Exch. Can‟t concede any departure from established C.S. procedures incl. arbitrn.

P.M.G. Lack of o‟time may bring postmen to heel.

Ch.Exch. And pressure of other C.S. unions – who have settled for 4% and have got to get this ratified by annual confces.

Field of analogues was agreed with union much earlier.

L.P.S. Confine parcels to large parcels?

M.W.P.(D) Public opinion will be against us. Ch.Exch. &amp; P.M.G. shd. have Press confce. To-morrow to answer unions confce. To-day.

P.M.G. I will consider L.P.S.‟s point on parcels.

8. U.N. Conference on Trade and Development. (oral)

S/S.I. I attended confce. in 3rd week. First, a meeting with C‟w. who agreed that confce. was going sour and urged us to take lead. I did so, and this directed confce. to specific issues. We rejected premise of “automatic” rectification of trade imbalances.

L.P.S. Verb. sap. – value of C‟w. discussion on trade matters.

S/S.I. I will emphasise this publicly.
