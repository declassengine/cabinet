C.C.(64)12 1 December 1964. 11 a.m.

1. The Congo. (oral)

F.S. Sitn. still grave. No chance of another rescue opn.: no reliable informn. about scope of problem or possibilities of rescue. Govt. troops can‟t advance fast: too few and terrain &amp; logc too difficult. Rescue saved many lives: but may therefore have endangered others. ?Try to mount some conciliation opn. ?At least say so in public: but be careful – chances not good.

M/S.D. I agree. Needles in haystack rescue not on. But points to failure of members of U.N. to finance countenance of U.N. force. Only real soln. is restoration of U.N. presence. Remember risk of retaln. against Eurs. in other Af. countries.

F.S. Impossible – no money. But ? ask U. Thant to appoint mediator: and support OAU proposal for fact-finding mission. Say so in public?

P.M. F.S. and I will explain posn. to leader of Oppn. Agree on public statement. In Lords also, if necy.

2. General grant to Local Authorities. C.(64)21&amp;22

M.H.L.G. Order necy. before Christmas. No change in first year: L.A.‟s accept cut of £17m. But in second year unless accept increase of £20m we shall increase rate burden. And in past we have always under estimated L.A. expdre. Since we may abolish G.G anyhow, little point in legislating for annual settlement; but must accept extra £20m. if to avoid major row on rates and buy ourselves time in which to undertake reform of local govt.

H.S. I am v. concerned about child care (as contribns. to general reform).

That means planning 18 months ahead – i.e. well into second year.

Ch.Secy. a) 2-year system is to suit L.A.‟s.

Over 5 years, actual expdre. has broadly matched our ests.

b) Must be related to total demand on resources. Inherited commitments are more (by £100m. of taxn.) than resources will accommodate in near future, even allowing for 4% growth. We have already taken on another £100m. worth for benefits &amp; health charges. See my para 5.

Hence my proposal. Otherwise Ministries concerned must find economies in their own rates corresponding to Expre. which is covered by £20m.

S/S.S. We have same problem. If increase in E. &amp; W. must concede same in S. Legn. only allows changes for prices etc. It does not allow a change in second year after figures fixed in other respects. If we discharge our commitment to transfer part of teachers‟ salaries to Exch. we must

provide now for year in wh. this will arise.

Ch.Exch. But all this relates to existing services. Edn., Health etc. are also proposing new services – on none of which has agt. yet been reached. See para 5.

M.H.L.G. But we are only concerned with distribn. between rates &amp; taxes. No quesn of any addl. demand on resources. Total claims of social services a quite different issue.

P.M. ?Accept Ch. Secy.s proposal as basis of Order: &amp; PES –legislate e.g. for transfer of teachers‟ salaries (and adjustment of grant) in, say, Feb.

Ch.Duchy. Otherwise, we shall never reduce rates.

Ch.Exch. But each transfer must be paid for from taxes and wrong to pre-empt in lone field at expense of others.

M.H.L.G. No qun of expansion here: this is simply to finance existing services, and only issue is whether rates or taxes shd. pay.

P.M. Remit to P.S.P. Cttee. – for next Tuesday‟s Cab. if necy.

3. Children‟s Service in Greater London. C(64)20

L.P. No specific proposal for sacrifice. But national casualties inevitable in spring. Any one of 4 big Bills wd. be such if not introduced by end Feb., if only because of Lords. On this basis Ch. Bill must go to Leg. Cttee. by 19 Jan. Can H.S. conclude discussions by then?

And it will leave v. little time for reorgn. of admve. plans now made.

H.S. Drafting instrucns. well advanced. But drafting can‟t begin until we have consulted L.A.‟s Can I start these in uncertainty whether Bill is to be introduced? And, if they oppose, shall we nevertheless force it through?

L.P. Bound to make it more difficult in H/C.

Ch.Duchy. No enthusiasm for dismantling. Therefore dangerous to negotiate on basis that we are going to legislate.

P.M. H.S. shd. say we are considering legn: but wants to know boroughs‟ views in order to know what to recommend to Cab.

H.S. Agree: I will come back to Cab. by mid-Dec.
