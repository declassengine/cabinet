C.C.(65)5 28 January 1965. 10 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P. As in statement. Vote of Censure: amendment to be finally agreed.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Import charges

F.S. EFTA Ambassadors pressing for announcement of some modification, preferably at Feb. meeting. Also claim export rebates contrary to Stockholm convention and shd. be removed when FTA comes into force in 1966.

b) Iran

F.S. Assassn. of P.M. internal: no external causes. No change of policy.

c) S. V-Nam

F.S. New military coup: regime less likely to co-operate with U.S.

No scope for action by us.

P.M. Remember we are co chairmen: explore with Rusk, during his visit for W.S.C.‟s funeral, whether they want us to intervene.

Ch.Exch. Export rebates are intended to be permanent: we do not regard them as in branch of any of our intl obligns.

d) Rhodesia

C.S. Smith coming for W.S.C.‟s funeral: also Kaunda. Scope for private talks. [Enter Ch. Secy. Tsy.

3. Long-Term Public Expenditure. C.(65)10

Ch. Exch. As in memm. Public expre. must be related, systematically, to growth in G.D.P. – whether more or less slowly or at same rate. Relation must be planned: and priorities must be clear.

Inherited plans assume 5¼% growth of p. expre. p.a.: G.D.P. will grow at 3½% p.a. If so, higher taxn. &amp; restoration of private consumpn. inevitable.

Therefore allow rather more for private sector and rather less for p. expre. – i.e. latter must be extended over longer period. Otherwise extra £1000m. of revenue (over &amp; above natural buoyancy of revenue) inevitable by 1970.

[Assumes transfer of £100 m from rates to taxes.] Therefore plan on basis of 4¼% rate of increase: this will still require increase in taxn. – but at (?tolerable) rate of say £50m. p.a.

But this assumes saving of £400m., wh. must come out of defence – for which programme can extend for another year – but cuts shd. start now. At present no sign of this. But if we fail, we can‟t fulfil our programme.

Civil programme (apart from N.I. benefits &amp; N.H.S. charges) are inherited; and priorities are Tory choice. Yet they are – as I said before Electn – max. wh. can safely be undertaken. I can‟t pronounce on individual priorities: but I can and must on aggregate of demand.

Therefore start with Appx. – calculate what devt. of present plans wd. lead to: then revert addl. programmes to choice – for wh. £150m. might be available.

Avoid over hasty pre-emption of this margin by individual Ministers at expense of other Deptl. programmes.

P.M. Must accept, in principle, proposal for new look at priorities within realistic total. But assumed basis of 1964 prices must be applied on average, not individual, basis – year by year.

Ch.Exch. Watch addl. complicn. of B/P in case of oversea aid.

Must have basic &amp; addl. programmes by July. £150m. contingency allce. already small.

S/S.D. Accept need for redn. in principle. But objective not as in para 11, but to get defence down to £2000m. by 1969 and to hold it there henceforward.

[Absent for an interval.]

First Secy. Inconsistent with our social policies. Now seen how difficult to cut equipment.

Must therefore cut commitments, particularly E. of Suez: consequential cuts in equipment then relatively easy.

M.H.L.G. Housing is expensive in resources but cheap qua Exchequer. Which are we talking about? Does it mean that for 5 years house building will be no more than in Tory programme? If so, must reduce approvals by 9000 this year. But this saves nothing for first &amp; second years and saves v. little to Exch. in third year: and demand will merely shift to Bldg. Socs. who may cost Exch., by assistance, more than saving.

But some industrialised bldg. capacity already being wasted: a cut in p.s. housing (wh. alone can use in bldg. capy.) will be a real set back to our efforts to reduce strain on real resources. And, of course, disastrous politically.

Ch.Exch. I am not proposing a cut &amp; will accept same number of starts this year as last. But higher programme (wh. wd. cost Exch. nothing for first years) wd. pre-empt margin of real resources. Do Cab. approve?

No grounds for expecting decrease in pr. sector housing.

P.M. Cab. can‟t decide until proper case submitted. Resources aspect is for First Secy.: we are now talking about expre.

First Secy. But don‟t assume resources fully engaged. Already some waste: and addl resources can be created by new methods.

Ch.Exch. But I must remember implicns. for taxn.

M.H.L.G. Even so, %age increase for p. sector housing in Appx. is unrealistically low.

P.M. Can‟t be tied to these %ages, wh. are illustrative. (But any adjustments must be self balancing!). This doesn‟t prevent us from accepting Ch. Exch‟s. main proposal.

L.P.S. But does acceptance mean implementing Tory programmes?

Ch.Exch. See para 17. Roads programme is already announced up to 68-69 – by Tory M/T. – and L.A.‟s already planning on this basis. Sensible to work out in detail by July &amp; consider then what shd. be announced about programme. But not much room for manoeuvre – on roads or aircraft!

P.M. But must be accepted no sacred cows: priorities can be freely re-examined in July. In meantime no announcements of long-term programmes – i.e. accept para 18(a), but 18(b) only on these understandings.

Ch.Duchy. On social services, new scheme will involve supply taxn.. Transfer payments: not a direct charge on resources. Shd. therefore go ahead even tho‟ no target for N.I. realistic (tho‟ possible for N.A.). Must understand para 3 of Appx. accordingly.

Ch.Exch. Review can go ahead: but decision will be for Cab.

M.T. Roads increase explained by low base-line: our expre. per head of popn. on roads is far smaller than that of most other industrialised European countries. Road congestion costs the Economy £350m. p.a.

And pressure of public opinion to enlarge present programme (wh. is hopelessly inadequate) is unremitting.

F.S. Accept 5½% increase involves addl. taxn. This wd. be harmful as disincentive and politically; and perhaps economically. But these arguments need to be probed further. Why is 5¼% wrong, but 4¼% right?

Also must stress that inherited programmes wd. require heavy tax increases.

If so, easier to get acceptance of some tax increase.

Main emphasis must be on policies directly related to increase in productivity.

M.Tech. Cost effectiveness in terms of real resources must be real test – i.e. value for money.

Must hold balance between resources and taxn. M.Techy. must have enough money to stimulate increase in real resources.

[Exit L.P. : L.P.S.

S/S.E.S. Taxn. system not as naturally buoyant as it ought to be. Examine at leisure.

Must we assume agrl. subsidy bill continues unchanged?

M.A.F.F. If expre. directed to increasing prodn. is to have priority, agrt. is important qua import saving etc. Must have long term programme here too: and revised priorities – e.g. hill farming. Decision in July.

M.O.D. Accept proposals in principle. But must be able to plan ahead. I have been v. restrained hitherto: but I can‟t accept para 5 of Appx. in sense of being committed to precise arithmetic. Must be free, when outcome of actual expre. in 1964-65 is known, to re-examine with Ch. Exch., since cannot accept risk of lower %age of GDP.

Ch.Exch. Ready to re-examine: but warning on B/P must stand.

M.O.D. If margin is only £150m. my share is going to be v small. B/P argument fallacious if aid is tied. And other Deptl. programmes have B/P aspects qua import content. And aid helps to provide empt. in U.K. Also important as instrument of oversea policy.: I shall have to press these points.

Col.Sec. I agree. Less than 50% of aid affects B/P. Continn. of existing policies points to £240m. rather than £230m. Higher figure wd. enable us to discharge existing commitments – subject to 2 cases where addl. aid may be needed.

H.S. I support Ch. Exch.: but July decision on priorities must be orderly.

M.P. Fuel industries are already expanding at 6 or 7%: and even this does not provide enough energy. Further increase needed to produce assumed GDP growth.

S/S.S. I accept procedure. Inherited programmes are heavy: and margin v. small.

Housebuilding in Scotland lower than in 1949!

F.S. I support MOD: don‟t prejudice result of current review of extent to which aid burdens B/P. Assumpn. in para 5 of Appx. wd. produce more than £230m.

S/S.W. Watch impact of proposals on prices and incomes policy. Public presentn. v. important psychologically.

Ch.Exch. I am not deciding priorities now. Cab. must decide in July.

4¼% can‟t be justified absolutely: but it reflects a reasonable level of tax increase.

P.M. Accept 4¼% rate at overall 1964 prices. Therefore endorse para 18(a).

No judgment on priorities at this stage - particularly as regards Depts

with no expre. programmes of their own: posn. of MOD.

Accept expre. directly related to increase in prodn. &amp; prody. as having priority.

Must have particular regard to B/P. aspects: must have look at forward commitments on B/P in parallel with examn. of budgetary commitments.

Therefore accept overall limit on p. expre. for next five years: may use inherited commitments as argument in v. offensive debate.

4. Farm Price Review. C.(65)8

P.M. Details for Ch. Duchy‟s Cttee. Confine discussions here to main principles.

M.A.F.F. Limits to total and individual redns. in guarantees. Award of + £10m. inevitable.

Some part can be passed to consumer – e.g. 1d. a gallon on milk. But increase for milk essential to restore reduced prodn. Also world shortage of butter: and our prodn down. Increase on milk will help this too.

Cuts possible in cereals. But watch meat – world shortage and domestic prodn. falling. Therefore stimulate beef; leave pigs &amp; sheep as are. But can cut on eggs.

Must reorientate support – more for hill cows etc.

In short, hold posn. with modest increase in necy. directions. NFUs‟ may contest, especially on cereals.

First Secy. I support in general. But + £10m. too large, especially after last year‟s unnecessarily high award (for political reasons). Cut of £10m. justified. Might start with that and concede something if necy.

On details beef arguable but can be conceded. But increase in price of milk v. embarrassing qua prices and incomes. Prodn. may be falling: but too many inefficient producers remain and shd. not be encouraged to do so. Also dangerous to stimulate excess prodn., wh. M. M. Bd. will have to dispose of uneconomically.

Whole agricl. policy needs to be reviewed qua import saving and promotion of greater efficiency by amalgamation of small holdings etc.

C.S. We are committed to N.Z. not to encourage excess butter prodn. in U.K. Can‟t alienate N.Z. on trade &amp; defence grounds. Therefore I support First Secy. on milk.

S/S.S. Where is excess butter? Creameries in my consty. are unemployed; and prodn. is falling. Lucky if 1d. a pint will be enough. And difficult to stimulate milk &amp; beef at same time. Therefore start at + £10m.

Ch.Exch. Nonsense. Farmers can‟t be high in priorities, either politically or on merits. Cereals certainly need to be cut back. Watch beef – expre. of output takes long time.

But on broad strategy can‟t start at + £10m. And we are not bound by “share of efficiency” argument. Therefore start by - £10m: then set off efficiency factor in full: end at say + £3m.

P.B.T. Increase in milk price bad: last year excess prodn: and N.Z. butter is cheaper.

M.H.L.G. Declare interest. Agree on cereals: neutral on beef: prob. accept need for action to maintain milk herd.

First Secy. But 1d. on pint may cause consumpn. to fall. Therefore to concede wd. be bad politically and on prices and incomes – and might produce result contrary to objective.

M.A.F.F. Only ½d. a gallon for 4 months. And prodn. drop is serious: shortage v. damaging politically.

On efficiency I wd. concede £7m. – as incentive.

I have long term policy ready, dealing with amalgamn etc.

P.M. Ch. Duchy‟s Cttee. to take over. (First Secy. to attend first meeting). Shd. start low – i.e. a minus figure? Cttee. to consider &amp; report to Cab. on Tuesday. [Exit P.B.T. : M.H.L.G.

5. Postal Tariffs. (oral) [Enter P.M.G.

P.M. Issue one of timing.

First Secy. Felt better sooner than later, particularly qua p&amp;i policy. Therefore proposed 18 Feb.

But need decision itself be reconsidered? May affect p&amp;i policy at bad moment – merely to discharge inherited debt? Leave as continuing deficit, to be met by borrowing, until more politically opportune moment and efficiency review of P.O. has reported. This wd. be publicly defensible.

P.M.G. Postal finances are serious: and we have emphasised delay in reforming them.

We have also committed Govt. to 8% return target (and tempered it already by redn. from £45m. to £37m.); and 4d. letter has already leaked. Also decision now transmitted to 450 post offices in sealed envelopes (wh. can be withdrawn). Therefore political consequences of abandoning as serious as those of going ahead – particly in view of current wages claim, mounting deficit, and need to publish W.P. on Postal Services in March (for debate on annual Resn.).

Difficult to justify continued Tsy. financing of deficit while expre. on other (social) services being restrained.

Ch.Exch. Only real argument is political. Which way does it point?

Ests. will show largest increase (9.3%) ever. If it then becomes clear we are taking no action on aircraft industry or on postal charges but are contemplating enlarged housing programme and may have to concede nurses‟ &amp; teachers‟ pay claims – is this a good electoral posture?

And real danger of new run on £. Intl. opinion expecting defly. budget; can‟t offend this sentiment too much. Better to take each hurdle as it comes.

M.Techy. Basic issue in Nuneaton bye election was rise in prices. As I said before nonsense to try to make an 8% return on a deficit as well as on a balance. Also nonsense to deal with G.P.O. services in individual isolation.

Therefore wait for result of efficiency review.

Ch.Duchy. I support Ch. Exch. Confront electorate with true facts and need to pay economic price for services which it gets.

P.M.G. Only remedies – drastic cut in services: or subsidy from telephone services when long waiting list: or subsidise parcels service from Exchequer.

M.Techy. Can deal with printed papers by themselves.

P.M.G. But that wd. imply they wd. get the same service as first class mail, wh. wd. be operationally unmanageable.

P.M. ?Announce as part of Budget. In interim, ? increase 2nd class mail and parcels rates: emphasise efficiency review (interim &amp; report by end of March).

This might help W.P. problem.

P.M.G. Whenever done, requires an Order and 40 day interval. If so, avoid any interim increase on 2nd class mail &amp; parcels: too confusing.

Altvly., put problem to Price Review machinery.

P.M. Or, if in Budget, refer to S. Cttee. on Natd. Industries.

Ch.Exch. P.R. body not relevant. It is increase – not who approves it – that hurts.

I wd accept in Budget, provided part of consistent policy.

P.M.G. Sepn. of P.O. from Tsy. was accepted by Labour Party. Wd. this appear to go back?

P.M. But it is a tax on letters: and public opinion will so regard it.

Therefore, decide in principle to announce in Budget: rely for interim on review. [Exit M. Lab.

Ch.Whip. We shan‟t win an election (wh. may be v. near) by endless masochism.

S/S.S. We have attributed blame to Oppn. publicly. But if to delay remedial action, what is reason? Is review really enough? Most of the items have been reviewed already.

P.M. Decide increase shd. be made: no reconsidn. unless electoral reasons require. Announce with Budget.

P.M.G. Do my best to withdraw letters to postmasters.

6. Poll Cards. (oral)

H.S. What advice to Acting Returning Officers about preparation of poll cards?

P.M. Let them prepare them, if they see fit to do so.
