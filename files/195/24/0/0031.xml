C.C.(64)3 28 October 1964. 3.30 p.m.

1. Oversea Affairs. (oral)

[Enter Ch. Whip : M/S. FO. : Att.Gen.

a) Zambia

C.S. Last minute settlement of Chartered. V. satisfactory.

b) S. Rhodesia

P.M. Summarise latest developments before issue of warning statement – yesterday in order to anticipate S. Rh. debate.

Preparations against U.D.I. now in hand.

M.O.D. ?Offer economic aid if S.R. accepts constl. devt.

P.M. Yes – if Smith comes. Meanwhile officials to examine. [Exit AG. : M/S F.O.

2. Public Expenditure. C.(64)7&amp;8 [Enter M.P.N.I. : M.H.

Ch.Exch. As in memm. Another £180m. of infly. pressure as result of recent measures; also £220m. of new expre. i.e. £400 in total.

Can‟t correct in one step. But £220m should be cut to £150m. On new expre., concentrate on pensions. Rest must be deferred or at least discussed. Even pensions at 10/-, not 12/6.

Taxn. changes only illustrative: but some increases unavoidable.

P.M. Emphasise extreme secrecy. Also agree broad Budget strategy.

M.P.N.I. Cd. save £16m. on my earlier est. of Exch. cost of 12/6.

If only 10/-, we shall only keep pensions in line with increase in earnings. Politically vulnerable by comparison with Consves.: and 2/- increase in contribn. will be heavy in relation to increase in benefit.

Ch.Duchy. 10/- is no more – less – than was given last year. 12/6 wd. give us time to consider other schemes before further increase necy.

£4 more dramatic than £3.17.6.

P.M. Check whether saving of £16m. possible.

S/S. E.A. Add prescription charges and something for owner occupiers.

?Keep pensions at 15/-: add prescripn. charges: and split old people‟s homes with owner occupied.

P.M. On prescripn. charges: ? abolish: or do in two bites: or abolish unit charge.

M.H. Unit charge wd. not increase savings. And avoid piecemeal approach Pensions are diffce. of degree: N.H.S. &amp; and diffce. in kind. Must honour our moral commitment on this for sake of Govt.‟s image. No call on resources: and no need for legn. More urgent &amp; striking than homes for aged.

Ch.Exch. Unit charge wd. save £8m.

Ch.Duchy. Agree no tinkering with N.H.S. charge. Better to defer completely.

S/S.S. Agree no tinkering. Also spread benefits beyond pensions.

On pensions 12/6 if possible: but N.H.S. charges first.

S/S. E.S. Old people‟s homes lowest: 12/6 highest: N.H.S. charges second.

S/S.W. Do the 12/6 – mainly to give us time to frame new schemes, especially for minimum income.

M.H.L.G. 10/- if N.H.S. charges: but not without them. Young people – mortgages etc. – would understand, as matter of social duty, provided offset is large &amp; visible. Only 10/- and N.H.S. charges wd. do this.

M.O.D. 12/6 will be for sick &amp; unemployed as well as old &amp; retired. Therefore go for this. Spreading gives worst of all worlds. 12/6 higher than N.H.S. charges.

Ch.Exch. I can substitute N.H.S. charges for old people‟s homes – provided 10/-, not 12/6.

Correction to £110m. (saving of £16m.) accepted.

M.P.N.I. Many of the old don‟t pay N.H.S. charges.

S/S. E.A. And import charges will produce windfall revenue.

Ch.Exch. Irrelevant. Pensions, at 10/- are then 93: others bring this to 162.

P.M. Not at 12/6?

Ch.Exch. No room for o‟seas devt., labour deployment etc. Even so, we stand at £162m. when I envisaged £150m.

P.M. Private sector must contribute to disinflation too – e.g. office building, and other less essential building, by deferring starting dates.

If so, we cd. swallow the extra £20m.

M.H.L.G. We have to be concentrated in S.E.

Ch.Exch. I don‟t dissent: but 10/- will keep pensioners abreast of earnings and ahead of price index. We shd. have nothing to be ashamed of, especially in a B/P crisis.

M.Tech. Mere % age adjustment of too low a basic rate insufficient.

And economic expansion in interim before next increase must be allowed for. Must be optimistic in our general approach.

M.P. And also untaxed expense accounts etc.: capital gains etc.

M.T. 12/6 better than N.H.S. charges. Railway closures next year won‟t produce major savings.

S/S.D. Nor will defence.

L.P.S. I support Ch. Exch.

P.M. On strategy – ?defer to April (with warnings now) or do it now.

Latter – to take advantage of honeymoon and to capitalise on mess we have inherited. Best to announce now, even if implementation deferred till April: but implement as far as possible now, provided Finance Bill short &amp; simple.

Accelerate implementation of pension increase – to anticipate winter.

Settle for 12/6 &amp; N.H.S. charges.

Ch.Exch. Distribn. of contribns. to be settled separately.
