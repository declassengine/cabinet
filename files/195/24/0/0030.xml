C.C.(64)2 22 October 1964. 10.30 a.m.

[Enter Ch. Whip : M/S. C.R.O. : A.G.

1. Oversea Affairs

a) S. Union

F.S. K: little known, but certainly deposed. Possibly because of erratic procedures and friction with Army. New regime unstable: but future unpredictable.

No great change of policy likely. Reaction of satellites surprisingly pro–K. Arms for India most reliable indicator of Sino-Soviet relations.

b) China

F.S. C. not on point of getting bomb. But explosion disturbing.

One of few favourable comments is from Ghana.

c) Indonesia

F.S. New covert overtures at high level. Will follow up, v. tentatively.

d) Spain

F.S. Annual joint exercises with Spanish navy due v. shortly. To cancel wd. be v. abrupt and wd. injure growing trade. Nevertheless, P.M. agreed to cancel, as politely as possible.

e) Zambia: Chartered Co.

P.M. D.O.P. has considered. Govt. might be legally vulnerable if we wash our hands of it. Com. Sec therefore authorised to try to settle during current visit, with douceur if necy.

f) S. Rhodesia

P.M. Com. Sec will seek discussion in Salisbury, on basis of statement issued yesterday endorsing previous Govt.‟s rejection of indaba.

Discussion depends on Smith‟s willingness to let C.S. meet Nkomo etc. This not yet certain. If possible, must be ready to issue public statement as in O.P.D.(64)2. If so, relevant Ministers will be consulted.

S/S.W. If Smith obdurate, revert to C.P.M.‟s proposal for conference.

M/S. C.R.O. Day after refm. (6 Nov) may be last point.

P.M. Yes: I want a free hand to deal with this. Will it be rebellion?

A.G. Technically treason: certainly if they act to give effect to statement.

But if treason prospers, it is not treason. Therefore tone down?

P.M. L.Ch. &amp; A.G. must be consulted on exact wording.

F.S. But still be tough about it. And have statement absolutely ready.

P.M. I will invite Smith for discussn, if necy.? Agreed.

L.Ch. to concert draft, urgently. [Exit A.G.

2. Iron &amp; Steel Nationalisation. C(64)5

M.P. As in memo. W.P. ready by Jan. Risk of hybrid Bill addl. reason for caution.

L.P. If a hybrid, this Session impossible.

M.P. If omit 3 large companies, more likely to by hybrid.

P.M. Then proceed to –

3. Queen‟s Speech on the Opening of Parliament. C.(64)3

L.P. A week today is final date for Cab. decision.

Some Bills essential. Main policy Bills (list) are covered, overtly or by implication. Individual comments shd. be submitted urgently.

Some omissions (list): ditto for comments. Watch financial reservn. in [ ].

P.M. Retain elasticity on length of Session. And take advantage of “other measures will be laid before you”. I can elaborate, particularly as regards iron &amp; steel, in debate on Address.

Ch.Exch. Ditto as regards children‟s service, where we must be ready to deal with break up of Service.

H.S. I agree: and ?mention in para. 18.

P.M. L.P. to convene Ministers concerned &amp; decide tactics.

M.Tech. Action on concessionary fares v. desirable.

P.B.T. And on monopolies &amp; mergers. Therefore put in Q. Speech.

Also refer to exports, consumer protection and D. of I.

First Sec. Accept wording on iron &amp; steel. But ought to legislate in this Session. Delay politically indefensible: and essential on merits to get it done beyond wording; and vital for morale of Party at next Election (?quite soon).

Ch.Exch. For sake of industry, this Session, despite serious obstacles.

M.Tech. I agree. Steel confederation are with us, this time.

S/S.S. Desirable to do it in order to establish disciplinary tone.

M.T. Implementation will take time. Therefore do legn. as quickly as

possible, to avoid its being an issue in next election.

L.P. Don‟t dissent: but other Bills must give way and we must try to avoid a hybrid.

M.P. Must deal with BISCORE as well as companies. But I will do it.

M.H.L.G. And early. Land Commission &amp; Rent Control shd. take second place.

L.P.S. Lords will wreck it. Another reason for early action.

Ch.Duchy. Social reforms mustn‟t be held up. Therefore if steel, v. early.

P.M. Yes: get controversial 2R‟s early - so that, if we are rejected on iron &amp; steel, social reforms will be seen to suffer.

Agreed to do it this session.

I will settle Minl. Cttee. to which official working party must report.

M.O.D. Pensions: O.A.P.s expect early action. Also some refce to owner occupancy?

P.M. QS. Cttee. to consider.

H.S. Reinstate refce to efficiency of police.

F.S. Add some refce to Europe. And something to Boundary Commissioners about votes of equal value.

P.M. Let L.P., H.S., M.H.L.G. consider.

S/S.S. Sort out educl. points. Reinstate Highland Devt. Commn.

M.A.F.F. I have sent redraft to L.P.

M.H.L.G. Rent control will be complex: therefore avoid specific commitment to leasehold enfranchisement. Land Commission as important as steel.

S/S.W. Must try to do it this Session.

P.M. Yes – if a small and simple Bill.

Para 13 more important than para 15.

Watch priority of rent control, Land Cmn., l‟hold enfranchisement.

S.S.E. Mention reorgn. of civil service.

P.M. Law reform &amp; Parly. reform might be mentioned in my speech in debate on Address. I will discuss with L.P. and Ministers concerned; but essential for Govt. to keep control.

4. Economic Situation. (oral) [Enter M. Avn.

First Sec. Points circulated. Balanced programme of short &amp; long term action.

Statement to be issued not later than Monday, followed by P.M.‟s broadcast. But breaches of intl. obligns. are involved: F.S. will prepare way in W‟ton this weekend, so that U.S. will be forewarned but won‟t have time to object.

Statement must begin with frank disclosure of figures.

Then import redns. – even tho‟ won‟t affect 1964. Choice between quotas &amp; levies. Latter preferable – wider coverage: more easily defensible as temporary. Food &amp; raw mats to be exempted: also tobacco. Then stimulus for exports: relief from indirect taxn.: C‟wealth Exports Council. Rest obvious.

Ch.Exch. Not more borrowing: not a mere reversion to StopGo.

If W&amp;M Resn. on first Wedy., levies in operation by mid Nov. But must settle scope and coverage v. quickly. E.F.T.A. must be included.

[F.S. agreed.]

Price index will rise by 1%. Must accept this.

Export incentive based on rebate for particular items – vehicle duty; petrol &amp; oil; stationery. Must emphasise prices shd. reflect this – and profits shouldn‟t.

P.B.T. Levies less likely to have been effective than quotas. Second dose may be needed.

Risk with EFTA (and GATT) is real.

M.Tech. Dangerous risk. ?Quotas better – even if retaliatory action.

Export incentives will simply go into exporters‟ pockets.

P.M. Levies better qua GATT – more clearly temporary: and W.E. members of GATT can‟t afford to throw stones. Retaliatory quotas worse!

Export incentives psychological rather than practical. And risk of profits covered by (3)!

M.O.D. Levy, increasing C/L, will be taken as wage cut. Unwise to combine with this sort of export incentive. Another case of unfair sharing of burden.

P.M. But quotas (without 100% price control) wd. equally inflate prices.

S/S.D. Can benefits of export incentives be shared with workers?

P.B.T. No: not to subsidiary firms! Only to immediate exporters.

M.H.L.G. ?Delete exports incentives. Might strengthen statement.

First Secy. No: must have some positive content.

M.Tech. Incomes policy must start with employers.

P.M. Must distinguish between long term growth (technology) and short term B/P. deficit. I will emphasise statement is directed to latter and is without prejudice to former. Both M. Tech. and M. Lab. to be present at talks with F.B.I. etc.

M.Tech. And savers of imports must be rewarded as well as promoters of exports.

M.Avn. On (4), avoid refce to Concord. £7m. spent: £13-14m. more committed. Total cost £350m. (of which U.K. wd. pay half): about ⅓ might be recovered if sales v. good. But 40% of running costs might have to be subsidised.

P.M. Endorse principle of (4) – for sake of civil technology. And mention Concord as earnest of intention.

M.Avn. But no break clause in agt.: and French might sue (£20m. damages).

And other Anglo-French projects might suffer. Therefore leave till early technical talks and then decide to terminate.

P.M. But must specify “prestige projects”: otherwise assumed to be T.S.R.2., wh. we must examine on merits.

F.S. Preferable not to mention on Monday, qua relations with France. But I agree we must mention it.

S/S.D. Concord better than T.S.R.2. for mention on Monday.

M.P. I agree. Absence of break clause an advantage, since we protested at the time.

M.Avn. At least keep design studies going.

P.M. Yes: include in statement.

Ch.Exch. “ … out of increased taxn.” not “expanding resources”.

P.M. Cabinet approve statement: drafting now to go forward.

[Exit M.Avn.

5. Industrial Disputes. (oral)

M.L. Gap in docks dispute still wide. I will meet employers and unions separately in hope of getting a Court of Enquiry.

On railways, not yet at crisis point.

6. Railways Closures. (oral)

M.T. Our manifesto said we would halt major closures. This may be interpreted as reversing earlier decisions. I have no power to do this;

and it wdn‟t be consistent with modernisation of Economy.

Therefore I must confine myself to future – but on basis of implementing manifesto. T.U.C.C. procedure must continue to operate: but decision will rest with me, and I will take other Ministers into consultn. in each case. I will explain this, with rest of our transport policy, in statement in Parlt. Permanent way will always be retained until this policy is clear.

P.M. Take note: Cab. to discuss further.
