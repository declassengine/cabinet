C.M.(64)41 23 July 1964. 10 a.m.

1. Postmen‟s Pay. (oral)

P.M. Threat of strike. Can‟t yield while this holds. But possible compromise (circulated) wh. Ch. Exch. might put to U.P.W. before I see H.W. at 12.30.

M.L. Back date the 4%: balance as from today?

Ch.Exch. Concede, if necessary, during negotiations. Also offer of P.R.U, as for Jan ‟65, on ‟64 wages.

L.Ch. Delete implicn. that P.R.U. survey won‟t be completed till 1 Jan.

Say “when completed, which on any view must be by 1 Jan …”.

But suppose we stand firm? Concession now, rapidly and under threat, after complete inactivity, not v. creditable: and a v. bad precedent.

M.P.B.W. And suppose they reject this?

P.M.G. If we go to say 6%, that is likely to be P.R.U.‟s advice.

And we must know how much of the 3½% we will advance.

L.P.S. Revert to idea of P.M.‟s broadcast first?

P.M. Call to the nation not a good prelude to capitulation!

Ch.Exch. Credibility of concession improved by tone of Press.

Ch.Duchy. But if they reject this, then a call to the nation.

L.Ch. And some practical preparations!

Ch.Duchy. Add refce. to arbitrn. remaining available shd. be added to statement.

M.H. Don‟t let H.W. get the credit: tell him that Ch. Exch. is seeing Smith and suggest postponement of P.M./H.W. talk.

S/S.I. They will stand out for full 7½% as from 1 Jan ‟64. Are we ready to concede this?

L.P.S. It wd. be unconditional surrender!

P.M.G. 6% is limit beyond which surrender is clear. They wd. probably take 6%.

Ch.Exch. Concession only advances by five months 3½% wh. they will get on 1 Jan. anyway.

P.M.G. If a strike, we cd. improvise a “voluntary effort” service.

L.P.S. And a “State of Emergency” – keeping Parlt. in being.

P.M.G. Use of troops might provoke N.U.R. to refuse to handle.

M.T. On my own experience, voluntary service wholly ineffective.

P.M. Settle on concession: defer own talk with H.W. till later in day.

F.S. I agree: but we can‟t go to 7½% and must stick at 6%.

P.M. “Withdraw strike” passage shd. be said, orally, to U.P.W.: piece of paper to be handed to them shd. be confined to offer. Omit last para also – implies that we have not carried out Armitage hitherto.

Our offer must be expressed as offer to resume negotiations on basis of the formula. Content of negotiations must be kept separate, in terms of presentation.

On second thoughts, tactically wiser to see H.W. immediately after Ch. Exch. sees U.P.W. – to prevent discussions between them.

[Exit Ch. Exch.

2. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement. House to rise on 31 July.

S/S.I. Propose to announce enquiry into Rolls-Razor affair. Governor agrees.

No risk now that enquiry wd. prejudice chances of salvaging. Sitn. worse than appears: don‟t wait for this to emerge at creditors‟ meeting in some weeks time.

L.Ch. Is enquiry feasible while liquidn. in process? Make a compulsory liquidn?

S/S.I. It wd. be under S165(b)(iii), without prejudice to (i) and (ii). But I will check L. Ch.‟s point.

3. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) S.Union

F.S. My visit to Moscow next week. S.U. interested in non-dissemn. agt.: but unlikely to come to head.

b) Cyprus

P.M. Papandreou wants enosis, Notification and an island for Turkey off T. coast.

F.S. Turks want enclave in N.E. of Cyprus.

S/S.D. Watch link between MLF and a non-dissemn. agt. Duck latter as far as possible in order to avoid German finger on MLF trigger. They favour seaborne MLF as simplest way of achieving this.

F.S. I shall oppose finger on trigger: so will Rusk &amp; Schroder.

4. Liability of operators of nuclear powered ships.

C.P.(64)150

[Enter Parly. Sec. M.P. : Sol.Gen.

L.P. As in memm. M.T. is obstructing Cab‟s decision.

M.T. Parly Counsel now instructed. Wait to see result.

L.Ch. But it can‟t be ready by beginning of next Session: and then a discrepancy between land &amp; sea reactors and continued risk as regards Holy Loch &amp; Savannah.

S/S.D. Merits of basic issue v. arguable. Don‟t want a row with U.S. only to find that they have slipped out!

F.S. No approach to U.S. until we have considered Bill.

P.M. Agree. Draft Bill (copy of instructions to L. Ch.); no approach to U.S. yet. [Exit Parly. Sec. M.P. : Sol. Gen.

6. Compensation for former public servants in Fedn. of Rh. &amp; Ny.

C.P.(64)153.

[Enter Sec. T.C.

L.Ch. No legal or moral oblign. to these people, since were told, when joined Fedl service, we had no responsy. for them. (Designation ceased).

Treatment of those refusing comparable employment agreed between all five Govts.: also those who were redundant. No improper pressure exerted: and hardship scheme provided in addn. (wh. we have underwritten to large extent).

But felt that, since we broke up Fedn., we have some liability.

Can‟t accept this without accepting premise. But Annex examines possible concessions. Arguments against them v. strong – even on para 6. Therefore stand firm.

M.W.P.(C) Agree on merits: but won‟t convince diehards in Lords. But may be able to mobilise enough abstentions to avoid defeat.

Individual cases awkward.

L.Ch. I have asked Salisbury for details: he hasn‟t sent them!

Comparison with W. Indies can be answered.

N. Rh. have adopted Africanisation: and have – logically therefore – adopted, subsequently to main settlement, special measures for those whose careers may be prejudiced.

F.S. On basis of personal experience, I agree. Para 9 a possible escape route, if necy. to avoid defeat – but not otherwise.

P.M. Agree: para 9 v. doubtful – a possible irritant: but keep in reserve.

Sec.D.i.C. I don‟t dissent: but may be necy. to do something about HMOGS people on same sort of issue.

L.Ch. Not too quickly – otherwise may prejudice Fedl. people.

[Enter M/S. CRO.

[Exit Sec. T.C.

7. Queen‟s Speech on Prorogation and Opening of Parliament

C.P.(64)151&amp;152

L.P.S. As in statement.

Discussed amdts. to P. Speech agreed: amdts. &amp; comments on O. Speech to L.P.S. for consideration in Sept.

Ch.Whip. Prep of Bills to implement programme in arrears. Shd. be expedited: Leg Cttee. may have to meet in Sept., however inconvenient.

8. Public Order. C.P.(64)154

H.S. As in memm. (Kenyatta incident justified by absence of trouble on his last visit.)

Peaceful demonstrn. must be allowed. Usually criticism is of police for intervening too early and actively. Breach of peace is critical test.

L.Ch No “right” of peaceful demonstration: and we shouldn‟t recognise it. Crowds should be told to move on.

L.P. And some of the banners were an incitement to breach of peace.

P.M. But it wd. involve controversial legn.: untimely. [Exeunt P.M. F.S.

9. Stationing Costs. C.P.(64)155

Ch.Sec. Latest discussions yield draft agt. annexed to memm. In accordance with Cab‟s directions. Agt. without figures better than low figure.

Proposed suppy. letter abandoned.

Fedl. Cab. will accept. We shd. too: best we can get and better than no agt. It includes - cl.5. - provision to meet, to large extent, to meet S/S.D.‟s point about longer term objective. F.S. supports.

S/S.D. So do I.

L.P. Approve: so inform Fedl. Govt.: authorise signature. Announce by answer to written P.Q. on Monday.

10. Kennedy Round. C.P.(64)149

S/S.I. Sitn. bad: near deadlock on agriculture. Little prospect of move by EEC (despite U.S. hopes). French determined to advance techl. devt. of

agric before conceding anything. U.S. equally rigid.

Officials to discuss in Sept.: Sec. Gen. of GATT says, if we advance, negotns. must be suspended. Unrealistic. Must carry over Elections somehow and get on with exceptions. U.S. still wriggling &amp; have stipulated for agricl. exceptions by 16 Nov. as well. If they remain rigid after U.S. election, another minl. meeting early in ‟65 inevitable.

Whole thing may fail in Nov. If so must be ready: and study of implicns. shd. be put in hand now - and of altve. courses of action in detail.

M.A.F.F. Great tragedy if we fail. Not our agriculture wh. is to blame: we have

given assurances of access to foreign suppliers . Altves. may give us a chance to enforce France to come to terms with more liberal policies – e.g. low tariff club with U.S. &amp; EFTA.

S/S.I. Dangerous. Against our interests (counter discrimn. by Six, when our exports are rising). And wd. break GATT. Wd. consolidate Six instead of coercing France.

L.P. Agree: study by officials.
