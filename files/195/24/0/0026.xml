C.M.(64)46 8 September 1964. 3 p.m.

1. Southern Rhodesia. (oral)

P.M. Surprising developments. We expected a row and therefore prepared a stiff communiqué, to help Smith‟s opponents. But he has abandoned a unill. decln. and wants to negotiate indepce.. He now agrees indepce. must rest on consent (incl. Africans) and that we were entitled to be satisfied on this before indepce.

Motives? Domestic political – to take issue of u. decln. out of pending bye elections. Also cold feet about a u. decln.

Hence revised communiqué (circulated).

This implies taking views on A. &amp; B. rolls by normal votes. For tribal Africans some refm. needed. If he gets 90%, we must then decide whether good enough.

Smith will also make statement on political prisoners.

C.S. Motives probably as described by P.M. – particularly bye elections.

But, whatever the motives, he has conceded a lot: and we are not committed. Smith may be able to get rural A. vote, if chiefs back him. Dismissal of u. decln. v. valuable.

Note absence of any refce. to sufficiently repve. instns. But this subsumed in “acceptable to people … as a whole” – if Smith can establish this (which is v. unlikely).

F.S. ?Omit “so that indepce. could be granted”.

P.M. Smith wants them – badly.

L.P. A. consent so improbable that must be an ulterior motive. Is it really a basis for a subsequent u. decln.? And is it likely to embarrass us in General Election?

P.M. No – because he won‟t try to establish it before our Election.

C.S. And, if we turn this down, u. decln. wd. become a live issue at Election.

L.P. But no precedent for granting indepce. on any basis acceptable … And a precedent for Aden, Malta, etc.?

C.S. But it is what we have offered to B. Guiana – and did in Malta.

P.M. We have made it clear that indaba won‟t do and referendum must be instituted.

C.S. And that holds it over Election, after which deadlock will develop.

S/S.D. ?We shall be told that refm. was a racket: and U.N. will be invoked.

P.M. He has accepted observers.

M.Lab. But restrictions on Press &amp; prisoners must be removed.

C.S. Nobody reads! And on prisoners, Smith will concede liberty if constl. behaviour.

M.H.L.G. But we are trustees for Africans. Must be satisfied their choice is a free and informed one.

L.Ch. But statement leaves us to judge whether methods of ascertainment are fair.

Ch.Duchy. But we can‟t be satisfied if leaders of political parties are detained.

L.Ch. They must be so long as convicted of criminal offences. Otherwise, they are free, so long as they behave.

P.M. Propose amdt. on “any basis”.

“Repve. instn.” and “majority rule” difficult. But if inhabitants are content need we stand in their way?

L.P. Anomalous to give them a vote in order to decide that they don‟t want one!

P.M. Statement is deceptively simple. But no altve. It makes it clear enough that we don‟t believe it practicable.

M.Lab. Even so, U.N.O. may intervene on behalf of prisoners.

P.M. And both Oppn. &amp; black C‟w. may say this sells S.R. Africans down river.

C.S. But removes u. decln. from Election arguments.

P.M. But reaction of black C‟w. in light of C.P.M.s‟ Meeting?

M.Lab. Less likely on repve. instn. than on form of refm.

M.P.B.W. No – more likely to be a change of policy from C.P.M.s‟ communiqué.

L.P. Then try to get repve. instns. back into beginning of third para. – as our statement. Follow with his statement. Then leave issue open – as at present.

P.M. Agree: and delete last five words if possible.
