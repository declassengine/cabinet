C.M.(64)24 21 April 1964. 11 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

2. Resale Prices Bill (oral)

M.P.B.W. Amdt. 69. Why not accept?

S/S.I. Too wide: wd. wreck Bill. Have therefore worked out new amdt. (with Linstead) to protect chemists and others. See 89. Will also table amdt. to cover interests wh. have already been exonerated. I have put these to Parly Cttee. and asked them now to close ranks. Will also keep open mind on other amdts. during debate. But must maintain specific criteria of public interest (i.e. 3 “gateways”) not “public interest” at large – which was purpose of 21(b) of ‟56 Act and wd. be re-established by amdt. 69.

L.Ch. Doubtful whether this will suffice.

S/S.I. I don‟t despair of getting 69 withdrawn. Majority of Party back us and we mustn‟t retreat so far that we let them down.

M.A.F.F. Shall we avoid defeat or a bare majority on a vote?

Ch.Whip. I hope so.

P.M. “Specific and substantial benefit” wd. certainly provoke people to contest who wdn‟t otherwise do so. Must therefore resist and unify Party. [Exit L.P.

3. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Laos

F.S. Revolt over: S Phonma restored to Power!

b) CENTO

F.S. Shall be attending meeting in W‟ton next week. Useful chance for discussns. with U.S. Returning via Japan.

[Exit F.S.

4. Pensions and National Insurance. [Enter M.P.N.I.

C.P.(64)83 &amp; 88

Ch.S. As in memm.

M.P.N.I. On diffl. benefits for old, Cttee were in favour qua N.I. Age shd. be 75: amount 12/-. Wd. benefit 2m. out of 6m. retd. pensioners. Only possible when general increase. This shd. be 7/6 – with 17/6 for over 75‟s.

If so, old in N.A. must also benefit – tho‟ not necy. to same extent.

Also chronic sick? Cttee not convinced on this.

L.Ch. Many of N.I. don‟t want increase. Why not more for N.A. over 75‟s and less for N.I. over 75‟s? Must include chronic sick.

M.H.L.G. I agree – and wd. go further towards selectivity by minimum guaranteed income scheme. Special return of income, if necy. It wd. subsume all these awkward problems. Old‟s incomes must be raised: otherwise we play into hands of municipalisers in housing. Wd. in fact be same as N.A. – but much more generous. Then no need to increase N.I. pension ever again: and saving on pension increases for those who don‟t need it wd. offset cost of gd. min. inc. scheme.

Ch.Sec. No: freezing of rett. pension (and gradual erosion by inflation) puts thrift and self reliance at a discount.

M.P.N.I. After examining g.m.i. scheme, I agree with Ch. Sec. Dynamic element in N.I. scheme important for those above N.A. level but not well off. And g.m.i. gives no incentive to save or to continue working and earning pension increments.

N.A. cd. not be abolished: and alleged stigma of applicn. wd. be even greater. Finally, Labour Party‟s scheme based on incomes: onus on need – much better.

P.M. Let Cttee. reconsider on basis of paper by M.H.L.G. – to be circulated to all Cab. Mins. (with other P.N.I. papers) – but proceed now on assumptn. will be rejected.

H.S. Present Chair of Ass. Bd. favours flat increase for old on N.A. Therefore let treatment for N.I. and N.A. be same.

Ch.S. Cost of chronic sick wd. not be great. But principles and basis of diffl. wd. be difficult.

P.M. Include them – i.e. those on N.A. for more than 5 years – if way can be found. Let P.N.I. Cttee. consider initially. N.I. and N.A. to be same in principle: amounts not to be specified at this stage. P.N.I. Cttee.‟s conclusions to be reported to Cab.

On war benefits - ?

M.L. Good economic case: overmanning is one of worst restve. practices wh. we have undertaken to tackle after Elecn. This wd. do much to overcome opposn. to drop in income resulting from change of Empt. i.e. wd. help short term employed, redundancy scheme (legn.) _ catering for man sacked after long service. These two measures wd. put us in better posture to eliminate rp‟s in labour.

Wd. not be difficult to do this (on ec. grounds) in advance of general increase (on social grounds) in ‟66. But shd. have to do it, for psych.

reasons, at outset of new Parlt.: and if must therefore be separated from general increase, do it now. Wd. be welcomed by employers: and wd. let me go ahead with redundancy.

M.P.N.I. I agree. This wd. relate benefit to need. Pensions already related to income: logical to extend to short term benefits also.

Wd. also reduce pressure on flat rate.

But can‟t take alone: sickness and widows‟ short term benefits wd. have to be done.

Ch.Exch. Wd. make no impact on r.p.‟s in labour. But wd spread – as M.P.N.I. says: and illogical to give extra help in short term when need is less than after long period of unempt.

M.L. But employers believe it wd. help them: and I cd. then press them on redundancy scheme wh. wd. help long term unempd.

L.Ch. All casually and seasonally unempd. wd. benefit?

M.L. Over 60% wd. be excluded by definition. For others some remedy for techl. unempt. is needed.

Ch.Sec. Single man benefits most: and he least needs inducement to move.

Redundancy is only 10% of unempt.: therefore v. expensive remedy, financially and administratively.

P.M. Consider further - on basis of package proposals by M.L.
