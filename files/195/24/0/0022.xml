P.M. As in memm.

S/S.E.S. Briefing to include expln. of “symbols”.

P.M. Reserve decision on P.P.S.‟s N.V.

3. Foreign Affairs

a) Laos

M.W.P.(C) S.U. threaten to resign co chairmanship of Geneva Confce. ? Genuine – because of Sino-S. dispute. Or an attempt to force us to a 14 nation confce. F.S. will pursue in Moscow.

b) Cyprus

M.W.P.(C) Mediator &amp; U.S. ask if we will accept T. troops in S.B.A.‟s. C. of S. wd. reluctantly accept small numbers for sake of settlement. We have said at Geneva we wd. consider – even tho‟ departure from our stipn. that S.B.A.‟s to be excluded from settlement.

M/DRAF If so, must have some sort of NATO cover: i.e. U.K. cdr. wd. wear two hats. Must settle before Assembly meets: otherwise M. will appeal to A. over lead of S.C.

L.Ch. T. troops may weaken our hold on S.B.A.‟s?

M.W.P.(C) Even so, can‟t oppose outright.

P.M. Keep under close watch. U.N. mandate expires on 27 Sept.

C.S. Sitn. deteriorating. Arms getting in. Enemy more aggressive. Radfan being duplicated in Dathina. Must hold the tribes – by any means.

4. Lang Report on Ferranti Contracts. C.P.(64)157

M.Avn. Report published at 4 p.m. F. to repay £4¼m. by instalments, leaving profit of 21%. Initial repayment offset against tax: no net payment, but a good company who can‟t be squeezed too much.

Exchange of letters – containing expression of confidence &amp; promise of no future discrimn.

L.Ch. Expression of confidence ridiculous. (Non discrimn. reasonable).

M.Avn. But it all happened four years ago.

M.L. Totally inconsistent with Lang report – see para 52.

S/S.E.S. And confidence means confidence in financial stability – wh. they clearly haven‟t got.

? Recall letter, if F. hasn‟t leaked it already.

P.M. Try to get both letters reworded. Confidence confined to Company‟s technical ability. Letter as is will damage F. by ridicule.

Ch.Exch. ? Add, if necessary, shall examine future contracts carefully.

P.M. Publish: or deal with by way of reply to Dalyell‟s P.Q.

L.P.S. Too serious for a P.Q. wh. won‟t be reached. Publish as W.P.: P.Q. to refer to this.

S/S.I. W.P. tomorrow will be later than Report – a pity.

M.Avn. ? A statement today. [Exit C.S.

Ch.Whip. Or delay publicn. of report till later in day and publish letters at same time.

S/S.I. H.W. will then press at end of Questions: and reply “wait for publicn”.

Will be unsatisfy., especially since letters do not refer to instalments plan.

M.W.P.(D) Confidential copies of report already with Press, deadlined 3 p.m.

Can‟t delay.

Ch.Whip. Must stick to this: publish letters in Hansard.

M.W.P.(D) But Press already imply single payment. Instalments – first being mere tax adjustment – much less presentable. But must be frank from outset.

L.P.S. Take credit for heavy tax already collected! Offset then natural.

L.Ch. Don‟t crow. Present quite neutrally.

P.M. Ch. Exch. to agree phrasing with M.Avn.

S/SLd. What about substance of report and criticism of M.Avn. procedures?

M.Avn. Wait for second report.

M.A.F.F. Watch language of letters, to take account – by implican. – of tax refund.

Avoid impression of single block payment.

P.M. Leak attributable to Ferranti – tho‟ not admitted. May have to say this in debate.

L.Ch., Ch. Exch &amp; M. Avn. now to adjust letters urgently.

[Exeunt L.Ch. Ch. Exch., M. Avn.

On admve. failures, M. Avn. should circulate memm for Thursday‟s Cab.; and prelimy. discussion of tactics tomorrow.

Must consider whether any enquiry into leak shd. be conceded.

5. Land Values C.P.(64)145

M.H.L.G. Land values have increased sharply. Some of our supporters wd. tolerate this. But inaction criticised by responsible Press, substantial developers. Oppn. may make it main Election issue. If so, we are v. vulnerable.

Remedies? Release of more land: but this will not reduce prices but only abate steepness of rise: and it will upset farmers. Any real effect wd. be achieved only by sacrificing whole of Green Belt: and even that might reduce price by only 10%.

Altve. is some form of devt. levy; modest - in order not to inhibit release of land: linked with planning permission – in order not to lead to general c. gains tax. Leave till late, in order to avoid detail: and reply to teasing on grounds that sitn. has changed. Much more presentable than Oppn.‟s. bureaucratic proposal (Land Cmm.)

Ch.Duchy. Might salve our conscience. But why have we left it so late? We may be mocked, not teased. And modest charge cd. look v. ineffective.

And unpopular with large section of Party.

M.P.B.W. Right answer is to make more land available for private enterprise in new &amp; expanded towns.

Emphasise extent of recovery via taxn. &amp; rates: and 3 year tax in F. Act 1962; and reform of planning procedure: and system of advance purchase for urban renewal.

Our case is better than we have got across.

H.S. None of these arguments will help at Election. I now support M.H.L.G.

S/S.E.S. Can‟t afford to admit that our policy for last 13 years has been wrong.

Public concern directed to a) excessive price of land – wh. Oppn. scheme wd. purport to remedy but ours wd. not affect.

b) wickedness of excessive profit – wh. a modest levy wd. not meet.

Ch.Sec. Political advantage nicely balanced. But I side with M.H.L.G. –

mainly because inaction in face of scandal is worst political sin. People with small incomes (postmen!) and heavy taxn. resent others who pay no tax on v. large capital gains. And devt. does owe something to public action. Case exists not for a tax but for a charge for a franchise – but not 100%, wh. was real fault of devt. charge.

But administratively difficult – shortage of valuers (postponement of next revaln.!)

M/S.E.S. I agree: we shd. back a devt. levy. Justified by investt. Programme; need for more revenue: need for incomes policy: advocacy by responsible developers. May be political advantage in doing this – if only to hold our own younger candidates.

S/S.S. No real problem in Scotland until recently: and it will now grow, particularly in S.E. of E. &amp; W. I support M.H.L.G.

M.L. So do I. Counter arguments too sophisticated to prevail against public resentment at “unfairness”, - wh. is real impediment to incomes policy. Not a change of policy – the logical development of success of other policies. Need not logically lead to general c.g. tax.

[Re-enter L.Ch. : Ch. Exch. : M. Avn.

S/S.I. Yes it does! Gains on securities are direct result of Govt‟s economic policies.

Aboln. of devt. charge was one of our great battle cries. How do we restore it at a defensible level? Differences between Parties increasingly difficult to explain: we shd. not blur them still further.

Real remedy is to overcome L.A.‟s obstruction of release of more land.

Real complaint is in big cities – wh. will always be difficult &amp; expensive. Confine ourselves to extension of ‟62 F. Act.

[Final discussion on Ferranti: Exeunt L. Ch. : Ch. Exch. : M. Avn.

P.M. What is answer to inadequacy of say 25%?

Ch.Sec. In order not to put up price of land: and in order to do something.

M.H.L.G. ‟62 Act wd. encourage evasion &amp; cause land to dry up. Shd. avoid committing ourselves on detail as far as possible.

M.W.P.(D) Real remedy is extension of advance purchase of land on large scale,

for private as well as public devt.

M.W.P.(C) Sitn. has changed recently. Informed opinion now supports M.H.L.G.

And land prices are going on rising – to point at wh. they now affect price of houses. Wrong that large fortunes shd. be made by public initiative. I support M.H.L.G.

L.P.S. Don‟t underestimate strength of feeling against him!: If we do anything, leave it v. vague.

M.H. Don‟t risk accusn. that, if we thought this right, we ought to have done it in Budget.

P.M. I agree: and we cdn‟t leave it all that vague.

M.A.F.F. What do we want to do if we win Electn? That determines how much, if any, we put in Manifesto.

H.S. Let M.H.L.G., in consultation with Ch. Exch., draft:-

a) statement on lines he wd. wish.

b) “ to be used in Election if decision goes against him.
