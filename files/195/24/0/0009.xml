C.M.(64)29 26 May 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Laos

F.S. Serious situation as result of P.L. capture of Plain of Jars.

U.S. want prelimy. talks in Vientiane, as prelude to confce.

Only U.S. belligerence will halt China. Various U.S. manoeuvres possible.

We might send fighters to Thailand.

P.M. And cut neck of Laos, in order to prevent attack through V. Nam.

S/S.D. Fighters – yes: but not much more so far as we are concerned, in view of reinforcements to B.G.

F.S. U.S. are completely committed to S.V.N.

S/S.I. But they aren‟t doing much – except insist on P.L. withdrawal before confce. wh. P.L. won‟t accept. No point in military inaction and diplomatic impossibilities. Have U.S. written off northern Laos?

P.M. Geneva confce. wd. be better than prelimy. confce. which will merely waste time and allow P.L. to go still further.

Meanwhile fighters for Thailand the most we can do!

b) Indonesia

F.S. Summit more probable. ?5 June in Tokyo. Let it go ahead.

C.S. Must be some prior withdrawal of guerillas. May fail on this: but shd. succeed, if possible.

c) Br. Guiana

C.S. Recent inter-union strike in sugar plantations has provoked civil disorder. S. of Emy. declared; reinforcements sent. But some emergency powers now withdrawn: and we may have to reinstate them by O. in C. and perhaps to revert to direct rule.

d) S. Arabia

C.S. Sitn. a little better: Rulers more disposed to “liberalise”.

Prelimy. confce. shd. be broadly achieved.

e) Malta

C.S. Defence Agt. being negotiated: may succeed in our objectives if finance right. Have told B.O. that, if we don‟t, no point in keeping forces in M.

Posn. of Church will then remain.

Indepce. legn. will be in this Session. Cannot string along any further.

Nor can we defer legn. till next Session.

M.H. But can‟t risk controversial Bill at this stage. ?Protract negotns. to point where we are committed to indepce but have no time to legislate.

S/S.D. And Defence Agt. not yet certain. Interrelation of defence and finance still to be settled.

C.S. Needn‟t take long. And can‟t defer indepce. any longer.

L.P.S. Inclusion in Leg. Prog. was on assumption non-controversial. This will be controversial – at least on 2R, 3R and in Lords.

C.S. But they cd. always amend constn. subsequently.

P.M. Consider further at D.O.P.

f) India – Aid

S/S.I. Our contribn. to consortium must be settled, since negotns. now in train.

Ch.S. We will accept £30m. (present level) if C.S. wants this.

S.S. Yes. I do.

P.M. Approve.

g) U.S.S.R. – U.K. Agricl. Exhibn.

M.A.F.F. Ag. Exhibn. a great success. Russians v. impressed. Prospect of substantial orders: and Russians wd. like co-operation in agricultural research.

Shd. mobilise our service outfit and respond rapidly.

Ch.Exch. Yes: but they don‟t always follow up initiatives of this kind.

P.M. Even so, don „t let Oppn. scoop this. Statement to be agreed between M.Edn. and Sc., F.S., M.A.F.F., etc. before H. Wilson goes to Moscow.

Bring in B/T and industry (I.C.I.). Also Ch. Exch. in case of large orders involving more credit.

3. Rates C.P.(64)104

Ch. Exch. As in memm.

S/S.S. I agree.

P.M. Maybe: but Manifesto must be more explicit.

M.H.L.G. Allen report (without appendices) in August: but not publishable until after election. InterdeptL. study must await report. But August

preview of report shd. enable us to identify groups most in need of help.

P.M. At least stress growing burden of Educn.?

M.H.L.G. Mere transfer wd. be v. expensive and wd. not really help those most in need.

Ch.Sec. Therefore wait till Allen report allows us to forecast discrimy. relief.

M/SE.S. But shd. concede some transfer of educn. expre., without specifying how or how much. Justified by national character of reasons for expanding educn.: and by fact that really rigorous educn. expansion ought not to depend on inelastic source of revenue.

Ch.Exch. Some transfer of some expre. – may be: but no more specific than this.

M.P.B.W. But beware of encouraging L.A.‟s to incur more expre. in substitution!

M.W.P.(D) And stress that transfer doesn‟t necy. mean relief for many people.

P.M. Better not to have Allen till too late to publish and have to comment before Elecn. Must have further discussn. when Allen known.

M.H.L.G. I will consider. Redistribn. of grant may be right answer.

S/S.I. Be careful of relieving “hardship”. That may mean creating new distortions.

P.M. Group of Ministers shd. consider later, in prepn. for Manifesto.

Meanwhile stick to C.P.(64)104.

4. Beef Prices. C.P.(64)108

M.A.F.F. As in memm. Hitherto U.K. only free market: now Europe as well – price has risen and Europe buying here.

Our exports now 1.6(000) tons a week. But nothing we can do to insulate ourselves. Inhibiting exports wd. mean transfer of meat from U.K. to Europe. Prices must be allowed to rise until they are near those on Continent. Price rise not so v. great: and has eased yesterday and today.

Argn. imports down by about ⅓rd. and Australian supplies being diverted to Europe.

No economic case for intervening. But politically? Difficult till beef comes off the grass at end of June – perhaps even longer if European demand remains high. Must accept high prices temporarily since have had advantage of low prices for so long. But must recognise that our exports (already 6% of total supplies) may continue to rise.

Price high therefore subsidy low (10/- per cwt.). But if we have to prevent exports, don‟t interfere with subsidy for reasons in memm.

Impossible to operate efficient drawback – particularly on carcasses.

Ch./Exch. And it wd. mean amdt. to Finance Bill. Better to control exports.

But N. Ireland?

M.A.F.F. Cd. allow N.I. trade with U.S. to continue. But control of Eire frontier unrealistic.

S/S.I. I agree with M.A.F.F. But don‟t be defensive. Labour Party‟s theory of bulk buying not a real altve. – see Austr. diversion of cargoes to Europe.

If our buyers won‟t outbid foreign buyers, it is because housewife won‟t pay. She has made adjustment already.

P.M. And stress total supplies still reasonable.

M.W.P.(C) But must get straight in public mind that we are not subsidising meat for benefit of foreigners.

Ch.Duchy. And watch posn. if we are forced to take action.

M.A.F.F. Even so, can‟t insulate ourselves against world price movements – otherwise we shall cease to be a net importer.

M.A.F.F., B/T. and Tsy. shd. consider physical control and have scheme ready, with least harm to N.I.

P.M. Yes. But must rub in total supplies: weakness of bulk buying: and subsidy to foreign housewife.

M.A.F.F. Total supplies not quite as high – 685,000 tons.

Subsidy is paid to producer: what happens to product is result of market forces. Subsidy does not affect what foreigner pays.

And, if subsidy will soon be eliminated by price rise, foreigner is subsidising U.K. taxpayer!

To say we won‟t subsidise agr. exports might reduce those exports v. considerably!

Ch.Duchy. But if we counter attack now, we can‟t easily take any action thereafter – because arguments against action now will become stronger as sitn. worsens.

M.H. N.F.U.‟s might expose fallacy of drawback on exports. That wd. make Oppn. walk carefully.

S/S.I. Rumanians might switch market. U.S. trying to divert shipping.

We cd. liberalise (canned) Canadian ham.

Episode throws new light on our forecasting techniques!

M.A.F.F. And on Argentine forecasting! In Europe it is fall in prodn. rather than rise in consumptn.

We wd. welcome Hungarian and Rumanian meat: Polish waiting health clearance. And U.S., who have surplus, may help.

F.S. Don‟t deprive ourselves of right to impose quota, if necy.

P.M. Then rest for moment on free market principle: accept (since no altve.) Belgian subsidy of imports from U.K.; indicate considering more imports: emphasise dangers of quotas and export controls; stress total supplies and 30% increase in beef prodn. in last 5 or 6 years.

M.A.F.F. to have Press Confce. on this basis today. And ?Minl. broadcast.

Or put out statement making main points, M.W.P.(D) and M.A.F.F. to do this – not finally closing door on export control but not indicating what action might be.

Officials shd. consider physical or fiscal controls urgently.

[Exeunt MAFF &amp; MWP(D)

5. Nuclear Powered Ships. C.P.(64)106&amp;107

[Enter Sol.Gen : Parly Sec. M/T.

S/S.D. My proposals are without prejudice to legn.

H.L. Agt. is bilateral between two members of N.A.T.O. But if one of our subs goes to U.S. or elsewhere, how shd. indemnity be settled? U.S. proposal in Annex A. as modified (for safety, notification) in Annex B, now represents – an indemnity – our unilateral view. It leaves H.L. unaffected: and it meets our needs as regards travelling warships.

L.Ch. But can‟t leave legn. on one side: or have inconsistency with N.A.T.O. S. of F. Agt.

We have always accepted principle of s. and ab. techy.: and are going to legislate for this on land. We have also got agt. to same principle for ships under Brussels convention. U.S. and S.U. dissented. Therefore we settled H.L. on formula wh. has no legal validity but made the point.

We can‟t now afford not to make it. Otherwise we are open to challenges when we legislate for land incidents or when “Savannah” visits U.K. Therefore must legislate as soon as possible – unless we establish right precedent, nobody else will.

? Pending legn. omit para 3 in order to keep posn. open.

S/S.D. This is not a bilateral agt. (like H.L.): it affects 3rd parties.

Therefore N.A.T.O. S. of F. Agt. irrelevant: and addn. to H.L. Agt. has no legal validity – therefore U.S. won‟t incorporate it in 3rd party Agts.

L.Ch. Even if no legal validity, it makes it impossible for U.S. to argue that s.

and ab liability is irrelevant. All I want is that they shd. adopt in public 3rd party document what they conceded to us in a secret bilateral agt.

F.S. Retain para 3 and send letter to Rusk, referring to N.A.T.O. Agt. and saying formula must be reviewed if either country legislates or Brussels convention is ratified.

L.Ch. N.A.T.O. Agt. is irrelevant: s. and ab liability is what matters. If this is not recognised in published formula, we are wide open to attack on grounds that formula without it is meaningless.

M.W.P.(C) Try to omit para 3, and have private agt. with U.S. that s. and ab liability will apply.

M/S.E&amp;S. U.S. won‟t accept application of civil rules to warships, on security grounds.

M.W.P.(C) Then get private agt. that H.L. Agt. will apply to Dreadnought.

L.Ch. But questions will arise on Savannah, where reciprocity with universal law not appble.

S/S.D. Then try to omit para 3 – and no more. But approach Rickover same time as State Dept. If we fail and I am expected to cancel Dreadnought, I must come back to Cab.

Next step will be Savannah, where we are at mercy of whatever they are prepared to concede.

L.Ch. But let it be privately agreed between us that H.L. formula will apply – both ways.

S/S.D. Even if we want to take this attitude for our own ships in relation to third parties, U.S. don‟t.

P.M. But let H.L. formula govern privately U.K. – U.S. exchanges of visits.

M.W.P.(C) No: U.S. already under attack by Spain.

P.M. F.S., L.Ch. and S/S.D. to consider some means of settling these two visits.

M/S. E. &amp; S. to attend on behalf of L.P.

Longer term issue about legn. must wait.
