C.M. 41(51).				7th June, 1951.



	1.	Japanese Peace Treaty.	[Enter  K.Y.



H.M.	Saw Dulles Mon:  he saw P.M. Tuesd.

	Gravity of failing to reach agreemt. with U.S.  Dulles has made

		concessions or explanns which make it easier for us to agree.

	We were pressing for Treaty when U.S. weren’t:  now posns are 

		reversed.  If we were now to disagree, they cd. go ahead alone. 

		H/C. didn’t like our exclusion fr. Pacific Pact:  now did that

		enhance our prestige in F/E.  This wd. have same effect.  Also

		wd. outrage J. v. us – also opinion generally in F/E.  Wd weaken

		U.S./U.K. relns.  Altogether v. serious.

	Dulles must say at end tht. talks have, or have not, bn. satisfactory.

	Rearmament:  sitn improved.  J. can’t be a danger for years.  U.S. have

		means of restraining them.

	Chinese participn:  hope we may get agreemt. to leave it to be settled

		later wh. “China” signs.

	Formosa:  may also be left.

	Congo Basin – H.S. shd. talk to D.

	Jap. Gold.  We shan’t move them:  &amp; they’ve got the gold.  They can

		meet us on some subsidiary points.



P.M.	W.S.C. has bn. in touch with U.S. &amp; stressed importce of agreeing

		with U.S.



	(i)	Re-armament.



K.Y.	U.S. firm v. incln of limns in Treaty.  i) Liberal Treaty intended.

		ii) Experce at Versailles.  iii) They intend to do it in practice by

		bi-lateral pact – see Annex A.  That is secret.  Annex B., 

		however, will be publd to-night:  includes some significant 

		remarks re U.S. providg. bulk of sea &amp; air power.  This gives us

		best security we can get.  Diffy is to get this public before

		Treaty – D intends announcemt. before draft Treaty publd.

	Art. 6(b).  D. wants it.  6(a) reproduces obligns in Art 2 of Charter –

		incldg. oblign to refrain fr. use of force.  But Art. 51 saves right 

		of self-defence.  Art. 6(b) designed to do no more.  D. has agreed

		to delete final phrase.  This seems reasonable expln.



E.Sh.	Seems odd.  Peace Treaty accompd by bi-lateral pact providg. tht.

		U.S. shd. have occupn forces in J. indefinitely.  Can you do this –

		after concln of Peace Treaty.



H.M.	When Treaty concluded, J. is sovereign &amp; has power to make 

		vol. agreemt.



J.	Yes:  they limit their rights by vol. agreemt.



H.D.	Tho’ Treaty says w’in 90 days all occupn forces shall be w’drawn?

H.M.	There is a proviso for arrangemts. under bi-lateral agreemt.



G.W.	A. &amp; N.Z. will accept this, I think.



McN.	a)	Doubtful if Charter shd. be quoted to justify Art. 6(a) &amp; (b):

		for Charter excludes settlements with ex-enemy States.

	b)	Odd to argue tht. you must have liberal Treaty but conclude

		bi-lateral assurg. U.S. of bases in J.

	But we shall have to accept it.



H.G.	Accept.  But press for fullest publicity re bi-lateral pact.



	 

	(ii)	Chinese Participation.



H.M.	D. started from idea of getting both Govts. to sign.  I scouted that.

	Series of bi-lateral pacts.  Wdn’t do.

	Proposed now:  multi-lateral with no Chinese adherence.  Treaty wd. 

		then provide tht. J. shd. not make Treaty with any Power more

		favourable than this Treaty unless it extended same privileges to

		States signatory to this.



H.G.	J. cd. then make Treaty with Chiang.  Under U.S. tutelage probly

		would.



J.G.	In that event our relns with Chinese in F/E. Colonies wd. be more 

		difficult.



P.M.	Gt. danger.  Gives J. right to recognise whichever China she likes.

	Our propn:  suspend decision wh. China shd. sign &amp; we then keep

		decn in hands of signatories to this Treaty.  That is much safer.



H.D.	That was my view.  This is most serious of U.S. demands.  We shd.

		press D. v. hard on this – going easier on other points.



K.Y.	Plan:  China be left out of multi-lateral Treaty altogether.  Then open

		to any Allied power to ask J. for bi-lateral Treaty.  We can’t stop

		J. fr. makg. bi-lateral Treaties with any Power.



H.S.	But it wd. be embarrassing to have J. makg. any treaty with Chiang.



K.Y.	D. ruled out P.M.’s plan, as one he cdn’t get past Congress.

	Wdn’t prevent J., after she becomes sovereign, fr. concldg. bi-lateral.



H.S.	We cd. say in our Treaty tht. J. may not enter into any bi-lateral

		Peace Treaty without our permission.



J.G.	While Ch. accession is in suspense, reasonable to provide that J. shall

		not conclude bi-lateral pact with either China.



K.Y.	Most unlikely that J., even under U.S. influence, wd. be willing to

		make a pact with Chiang.

	Our original plan provided for decn by ⅔rds of signatories which

		China.

		D. feels he cdn’t get this past Senate.



P.M.	We can’t be put in posn in wh. it is open to J. to make Peace Treaty

		with Chiang.



H.M.	U.S. will say ditto …….. with Peking.



P.M.	That’s O.K.  We don’t want to decide it either way.  Hold it all in

		abeyance.



	(iii)	Formosa.



H.M.	As in memo.



E.Sh.	Support this.  Follows logically our line on (ii).



P.M.	O.K. if they accept our line on (ii).



J.	If J. renounces her sov. over F., she can’t make a deal with Chiang

		over it.



H.S.	But, by such a simple renunciation, F. mght. revert to China –

		de facto Chiang.



H.G.	Add provision tht. J. shdn’t make any bi-lateral disposing of 

		territory w’out consent of signatories.



P.M.	Afraid of being edged into a posn in wh. we are in effect

		recognising Chiang de facto.



J.	Enough to make it clear tht. “renunciation by J.” means tht. J. has

		no power to dispose of F.



P.M.	Accept simple renunciation for F. if U.S. will accept

		our formula on (ii).



	(iv)	Kurils etc.



K.Y.	D. now prefers simple renunciation by J. rather than explicit 

		cession to Soviet.



			Agreed.



	(v)	The Ryukyu etc.



G.W.	India says:  no trusteeship.

McN.	They know tht. U.S. cdn’t get a trusteeship from U.N.  I agree - tho’

		it’s a pity.

	This plan involves going back on Cairo &amp; Potsdam.



K.Y.	They prob. wd. come into exception for minor islands.



			Agreed:  Accept U.S. view &amp; try to persuade India to agree.



	(vi)	Ship-building.



McN.	Grateful for efforts made.



K.Y.	Our posn is reserved pending report.



H.G.	M/T. is now anxious about this.



	(vii)	Japanese Gold.



H.G.	Saw Dulles.  Cdn’t persuade him.  Agreed to meet him again.

		Stressed comparison with G.  Challenged U.S. automatic right

		because occupn costs.

	His view:  v. diff. to persuade Senate tht. we shd. pinch the gold but

		go on helping J.  This wd. give J a good start, economic recovery.

		Reduced standards wd. increase risk of Commn.

	Must view this in light of Treaty as whole.  We shdn’t get much of the

		gold.  It’s the pol. aspect:  can we justify Treaty not giving us 

		any gold or rather leavg. it all to J?  Told D. I wd. prefer U.S.

		to take it than have it left to J.

	Persuade U.S. to take it themselves or keep it in trust (because China

		is a claimant).  Leavg. it with J. wd. accentuate our pol. diffies.	Can’t give way on this if we don’t get our way on (ii).

		If we got (ii), we mght. concede this later, with Austr. 

		concurrence.



J.G.	P.o.w. ques. is being fanned up.



K.Y.	Assets in neutral countries come into that.  And there may be chance

		of compromise there.  That wd. help.  E.g. make it available

		to Internatl Red Cross.  If we cd. get that, it wd. be easier to

		let the gold ques. go.



			Agreed:  K.Y. and H.G. to discuss before H.G. sees

			               D. again.



	(viii)	 Congo Basin.



H.S.	M’tenance of J.’s m.f.u. posn there wd. make Treaty most unpalatable.		Biggest pol. risk of all.  This mght. be a brkg. point.



K.Y.	If J. deprived of that posn in Basin, she wdn’t lose her m.f.u. posn.

		Only her special rights there are feasible to be w’drawn.



H.S.	I want both.



G.W.	V. many Comm. countries are anxious to deny m.f.u. treatment to J.





	2.	Four Powers Meeting.



H.M.	Handed round various Tels. to and from Paris.

	Davies doesn’t think U.S. or French will accept my draft.

	I felt D.’s draft was too legalistic.



P.M.	I agree.  No one will sympathise with argument re ques. for 

		decision – nor that v specific &amp; general.



R.R.S.	Shdn’t you seek to admit to agenda what they want as well as our

		counter item.  I wd. amalgamate the two.



H.M.	Don’t want at this stage to admit either to agenda.

	Prefer to stand on arguments against adding to agenda.



P.M.	What are the underlying causes when you have taken off 

		Cominform, satellites etc?



H.M.	R. non-co-opn with U.N., mischief-making all over the world.

		Rather too provocative to insert it here.



E.Sh.	Argument re N.A.T. in para. 2.  State what it’s for &amp; refer them to

		un-cooperative attitude of R. – veto etc.



P.M.	add … wh. has prevented U.N. fr. being used as instrument for

		preservg. world peace.		[Exit  McN.



E.Sh.	Middle para. cf.  p. 2.  Omit second half.



H.M.	That is whole substance of argument.  Don’t want to leave it out.

		Thght. Cab. hadn’t felt it was sufficiently publicised.



P.M.          y/	Must identify them here – unco-opve attitude as above.



J.G.	Reverse last 2 sentences of middle para.



H.S.	Strengthen that para. – as in pencil.



H.M.	Cd. we agree on substance &amp; then each send our own notes?

			General support for that view.



G.W.	Tel. 145 is important.



			Agreed:  Follow line of F.O. 85.
