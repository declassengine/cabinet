C.M. 23(51).				2nd April, 1951.



	1.	Korea.                                                    [Enter  H., B. &amp; Att.G.



H.M.	MacArthur:  another statement at v. awkward moment.

	We shd. ask Acheson wtr. Truman shdn’t give him directive – 

		acting for U.N., while we can’t indicate publicly to Ch. what

		we intend militarily, he shd. not do the opposite by threats 

		etc., in public.

 	Propose to send to U.S. a draft of a new directive.



			Agreed – in principle, F.O. to have discretion to draft.





	2.	Overseas Information Expenditure.



H.M.	Cttee on Infn Services accepted cut, overseas Dpts. dissentg.

	I &amp; other two Dpts. agreed not to pursue the dissent, after I went

		to F.O.

	Mention this because Press campaign wh. has broken out.

	I will consult 2 Dpts. on best means of spending reduced sum.



G.W.	I.E.C. Jacob is responsible – he shd. be sacked.



E.Sh.	Thght. this was coming to Cabinet.



H.M.	We must not surrender to Press campaign of this kind.

	I have arranged for Jacob to be seen.  *But I don’t want to lose 

		wavelengths.





	3.	Dollar Aid.



H.G.	U.S. Govt. proposing to ask for no aid to U.K. save for end items.

		Ousts aid for dollar components.  Prejudges Nitze.

	Am sending 2 Ty. offls. over at once for talks.

	They approached us before deciding.

	We shd. keep door open – even tho’ amount is small, Nitze shd. not

		be put in those terms.



H.G.	Nitze may provide it.



A.B.	Want to escape this dependence on U.S. Congress.

	Thought there was firm Cab. decision on this – no more dollar aid.



E.Sh.	It was left open – for considn later after Nitze.



H.G.	Not “aid” – pooling, or re-arrangement of burden among the 12.





	4.	Hong Kong:  Detention of Chinese Tanker.



J.G.	As in memo.  No power to detain.  The aircraft recently were held

		because doubt re ownership.  To detain the ship wd. be act of 

		war – risk of repercussions on our own shipping in Chinese 

		waters.  Cd. be reprisals v. H. Kong, wh. depends on supply of

		food &amp; water fr. mainland.

	I’m not prepared to instruct Govr. to detain this ship.



H.	Share these apprehensions – esp. as in para. 6.

		If U.S. views known earlier, we cd. have prolonged the repairs.

	Ch. Nationalists cd. sink her, if they wished, after she left H. Kong.



B.	Ch. can inflict much more damage on us than we cd. on them.

		260.000 t. of Br. shipping centred on H. Kong.  25% of tonnage

		in &amp; out of Ch. ports are Br.  15.000 Ch. sailors on B. ships in

		F/East.

	U.S. don’t understand our shipping posn &amp; are indiff. to our needs.

		A policy of sanctions v. Ch. shipping wd. boomerang on us –

		from many Powers other than China.



H.M.	Have discussed with Ministers concerned.

	This is exceptionally worth-while tanker.  While we have avoided

		provokg. Peking, we mustn’t be too weak on mil. matters.  This

		ship wd. prob. be used for conveying to Korea oil wh. Ch. sadly

		need there.  Apart fr. U.S. re-actions, we have troops in Korea –

		&amp; this wd. help Ch. to fight them.  Awkward situation.

	Peking unlikely to challenge detn in H.K. courts - &amp; if they did 

		mightn’t succeed.

	Other reprisals.  Maybe:  but Ch. have done this sort of thing already.

		Their record is bad.  B. ships shelled in approaches:  detained

		e.g. Flintshire.  Requisitiong. of B. property in Shanghai.

	U.S. re-action.  Emotional outburst inevitable – might get us into 			diffies.

		Tel. 937 fr. W’ton.  Strong request from Acheson tht. we hold 

		it as a military vessel on a/c of its size &amp; speed.

	Chinese wd. detain this ship if it were ours.



A.V.A.	What oil wd. it carry?  R.?  Or are we supplying Br., Dutch or

		Venezuelan.



Att.G.	Oil has bn. embargoed.  We are not supplying.



A.V.A.	Then v. limited use for the tanker.  Only fr. Vladivostock – or prs.

		Dutch.



H.G.	Will ply from Black Sea or Vladivostock.  R. oil.



J.	What of requisitiong. it, &amp; paying, for our own use.



B.	Repairs paid for – private contract.



Att.G.	Believe we cd. seize this ship – either because Ch. are King’s 

		enemies or because police opns in K. involve China &amp; U.N. resoln 

		gives cover, because it requires us to refrain from aiding Chinese.

	We have the legal power.  Ques. therefore one of policy.



A.	We are v. vulnerable in H. Kong.

	If we start this immoral game, our potential loss is much greater than

		our gain.

	If Ch. run it into Korea with oil, they are risking the ship.

	We aren’t entitled, on any principle of fair dealing, to pinch this ship.



E.Sh.	Tel. 660 fr. Tedder.  Sherman’s anxiety over this ship.

	Suppose we had more serious trouble in F/E., we shd. rely on

		U.S. help.

	Better tie up U.S. with us, by detaining this ship, than by alienating

		them.



T.W.	Para. 4(c).  What may happen to these ships?



B.	Ch. cd. seize them.  Or if Ch. sailors walked off, we wd. be

		immobilised.

		M/F. planning to draw more food from China.

		Let U.S. seize the ship at sea, if they are concerned about it.



H.McN.	Complain of short notice – by Govr.  Ship has bn. in port for 2 years.

		Repairs cd. have bn. delayed if Govr. had taken the point earlier.

	Similar short notice re aircraft &amp; pre-empting of oil.

	Surely we must detain this ship.  The U.N. resolution imposes this 

		oblign on us.  We have power to do it.  Fantastic to w’hold 

		B. oil (to our commercial disadvantage) &amp; let this ship go.

	Risk to H. Kong.  A matter of judgment.  Govr. has bn. wrong before

		in forecastg. trouble.



H.G.	Is this a “new departure in policy”.

	We don’t want to break off trading relns with China, or to develop

		sanctions.

	If we were bldg. this tanker, we shd. decline to deliver.  This has bn.

		so substantially repaired tht. it’s almost new bldg.  Detention 

		of a ship putting in for small repairs wd. be another story.

	Attracted by requisitioning for our own use.



J.	Legal position is w’out precedent.  Semi-war:  but contd trade.



H.D.	Balance of argument is in favour of requisitioning – tho’ it involves

		risks.



C.E.	Weight of argument is against C.O. view.



			Agreed:  Don’t release this ship to China.

			               F.O. &amp; other Dpts. to consider how to detain it,

			                         wtr. by requisition or otherwise.



A.	A wrong view.  Contrary to our general policy (in Korea) twds. China.

		Interference with a commercial transaction:



J.G.	This is economic sanctions v. China.



G.T.	Repercussions haven’t bn. measures:  they may be v. grave.

		What effect on our relations with China, with whom we seek a

		settlement.  Will it make that easier?



G.W.	Explain policy to Doms.



E.B.	This means applying sanctions v. China?



H.M.	No:  a particular case only.  No precedent:  no general implication.



E.B.	You may regret this decision:  cf. Grey &amp; Page decisions of

		1914/18 war.

		Square it up with oil &amp; aircraft decisions.



			                                           [Exit  B. &amp; H.  Enter  Wheatley.





	5.	Status of N.A.T. Forces.



H.M.	Main points in Art. 8 or 9.  Exclusive jurisdiction in last war.

		This is less extreme.



J.	Favour this plan.  Now U.S. have exclusive jurisdiction.  Only if they

		waive it can our courts come in.  This plan is an improvemt. on

		that.

	Incidentally, I believe this breaches Human Rights Convn.

	Some small points of detail cd. be improved – I &amp; Att.G. will go into

		these with F.O. legal advisers.



C.E.	Agree with J.



J.G.	i)	W. Indies.  Won’t upset existg. arrangement?

	ii)	I shd. consult Col. Govts. if constitutionally advanced.



H.M.	F.O. &amp; C.O. shd. consult on this.



E.Sh.	Reciprocal?



H.M.	Yes.

	U.S. may seek to extend it to troops operatg. otherwise than under

		N.A.T.  We shall have to watch this.

J.	Att. Genl. and I shd. be consulted.



Wh.	And me.

	Art. XIX. 2.  Why not to Chairman?



H.M.	Because ratificns deposited in W’ton.

			                                  [Enter  C.O.S. &amp; R.R.S.  Stevenson.

			                                  [Exit  Wh.

	6.	Anglo-Eyptian Treaty.



H.M.	Important.  And politically awkward.  Hence submit Def. Cttee

		recommns.

	Every pol. Party in E. promises to get us out.  Individual E. politicians

		will take accommodatg. lines – in private only.

	Vital for B. forces to stay in E. until they can go somewhere else.

	Choice:  i)    flatly say we’ll stay:  with big risks.

		      ii)   take line in memo:  tho’ it may be represented as retreat.

		      iii)  spin out the talks &amp; don’t hurry movemt. of troops.

	Suez Canal:  we have spoken firmly here and in Cairo.

	My personal inclination is twds. (iii).  M’while E. may see her own

		danger.

	Sudan.  E. want to stiffen up their part in Condominium.  But we 

		can’t make any concession on that.



E.B.	Phases of occupation – i)     security for financial advances.

			                    ii)    Suez Canal.  (World War I).

			                    iii)   Base for fighting world war.

	It is iii) which is now of interest to C.O.S.  And this was not

		contemplated when Treaty made.

	Army has had worst part to play in E.  Haven’t always bn. v. helpful.

		Attitude to R.N. easier.  Perhaps we shd. play up R.A.F. in

		future vice Army.

	World opinion has turned v. occupying Armies.  Feel we shan’t get

		consent for mil. occupn.  Hence my preference for (ii).

		Fear delay will make matters worse.  Must be done before

		E. elections.

	ii) wd. get over Canal Zone diffy.  Wd transfer issue to defence of

		Egypt.  E. For. Minister ready to concede facilities of E. as whole

		on such a basis.  Tried to get it on same basis as we have secured

		with U.S. in W. Indies.  E. want to be treated as equals.

		I’m willing for that:  wanted similarly to get Israel treated as an

		equal.  Wanted to get E. settled first.

	If we cd. w’draw our troops, by phases, &amp; put base on civilian basis.

		End talks at end/51.  Then so many troops wd. be w’drawn each

		year.  And m’while pick lively Egyptians and train them.  We 

		have never done so properly:  never produced an E. Army: 

		&amp; treated them as Gyppo’s.  Many bitter memories in Egypt.

	“Orderly transfer of authority” was a phrase wh. brght. them along.

	E. is the key to M/E. communications.



E.Sh.	Needs much thght. - &amp; more time for discn.

	May be we shd. make a new approach.  But can’t ignore recent new

		developmts. e.g. re Persian oil.  Bases are important:  safeguardg.

		of oil is even more urgently important.



H.M.	E. Govt. wants to begin negotiations – as soon as possible.



E.Sh.	In Def. Cttee genl. support for C.O.S. report.



H.G.	Must have more time.



H.D.	Tankers – cause for our delay.



			Discussion adjourned.

			                                          [Exit  C.O.S., Att.G., Stevenson.





	7.	Japanese Peace Treaty.



H.M.	Cab. wanted to delay.  We can’t now.  U.S. have disclosed their hand.

	We shd. claim credit for our leading part in this over 4 yrs.

	We have U.S. draft Treaty.  We shd. cut in &amp; make our views known.

		Japs. are saying we are delaying it.

	Feel now tht. we must go ahead.



A.V.A.	Dulles is leaking our confl. views.



H.M.	An addl reason for getting on.



H.McN.	Politically, a v. difficult problem.

	Don’t hurry to decide now to make a Parly statement tht. we are

		discussing this with U.S. Govt.



E.B.	Why shdn’t we ask R. for her views.  Don’t want to get a 3:1 posn in

		F/E., even tho’ it’s inevitable in the west.
