			                                                        [Enter D/Ch. Whip, K.Y.

	1.





CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000









2     General Election:  Use of Television.



P.M.	Tories, Liberals &amp; B.B.C. favour use of television.  Divided opinion w’in Labour Party.

	Don’t like it.  But doubt if we can avoid it.



C.E.	Now conclude no objn to it.



H.M.	Proposal is for one showing for each Party.

	Didn’t like it.  But believe it’s inevitable.



H.D.	Not to be done by any member of this Cabinet.



			Agreed.

					 [Exit D/Ch. Whip



3     Parliament.



P.M.	I must say somethg. about King.

	W.S.C. may want debate on Persia.



	2 Contd	Germany.



P.M.	Adenauer shd. not come over here during Election.  Visit shd. be p’poned.



H.M.	I agree.

				                 [Enter A.



4     Washington &amp; Ottawa Meetings.



H.M.	… M/E Command.  French claims: there and in Med.

	Risk tht. Turks may wish to come under Saceur.  Fr. are weak on that.

	Acheson – able, helpful and reputn is rising in U.S.

	N.A.T.O.

a)	too much talk in Council – inevitable.

b)	need for more speed in executive machine.

c)	E.Sh. succeeded in getting separate mtg. of Def. Ministers.



E.Sh.	Haven’t finished with T. &amp; Greece business.  Opposn by small countries overcome with gt diffy.  They fear it will mean less help for them in equipment.  Also fear extension of oblign under N.A.T.O. will lead to M/E. countries demandg. incln in N.A.T.O.

	Thus, on ques. of T.’s posn vis-à-vis saceur, diffes may break out again.

	Immed. availability of forces in west.  More important than big build-up by ‘54.  We made some progress in persuadg. others to bring existg. units etc., into state of readiness.

	Infrastructure.  Essential to operations of Saceur.  Met U.S. &amp; French Ministers &amp; with diffy. agreed to split of £80m. (14m by U.K.).  In determining next slice we shall take a/c of any advantage thereby secured to Fr. civil economy.



H.G.	Set out facts in memo. pretty fully.

	Ministers (E.P.C.) have considered dollar balance. Deficit in 3rd qtr. now likely to be 600m. because movemt. of capital.

	Handed in memo. on arrival (Annex I).  Warned of consequence on our def. p’mme.  Public;  we go ahead with 4.700m p’mme relying on aid fr. Allies.  Private;  warned U.S. Ministers we mayn’t be able to do it.

	Later, handed in Ann. II.  Cdn’t have expected a reply.  But their attitude was sympathetic.

	U.S. have taken M.T. Def. Plan much more seriously than we have.

		Regarded it as a firm p’mme.  Capped by Eisenhower Plan wh. involves even more.  These go beyond economic realities.

		Talked with French, who put fwd. idea of wise-man committee.

		I scouted any idea of refce to independent experts.  U.S. put up Harriman:  Fr. prob. will propose Monnet.

	Have made it clear tht. these mil. requiremts. imply fresh financial basis e.g. Lend-Lease.

	U.S. now talk of screening mil. demands.

	Cttee of 12 will offer opening for pressing this.

	Waiver. We shd. do nothg. until after Election.  Any decn wd. bring this into Br. domestic politics.

		I have said publicly in U.S.

a)	we will pay our legal debts

b)	we have provided for it in Budget

c)	Dollar balance worsening

d)	No Cab. decn on waiver 

e)	I like to pay my debts if I can.

	Prov. unwise to ask for it.  (Abbott’s view).

	But pro tem defer decision until after Election.



H.D.	Formula shd. be prepared for use in Election.



H.G.	Representn on Cttee of 12.  Recommend apptmt. of Ch/Exch.  I can’t be active in immed. future.  Alternate:  Plowden or Brook in preliminary stages.



P.M.	How can Ch/Ex. do it?  If official is to be there most of time, why nominate Minister.  Posn of offl. wd be weaker as alternate.



H.G.	I took this line publicly in Ottawa.



P.M.	Alternate:  another Minister.  They intend apparently to meet full-time.



A.	Drifting into system of govt. in wh. a no. of nations act together in closest consultn.  Ch/Ex. wd. have to be in 6 places at once if he were our repve on all these occasions.  H.G. shd. consider other methods – or we shall face sitn in wh. most important of our Ministers are never here.  Don’t commit ourselves to havg. Ch/Exch. as repve.



E.Sh.	Consider in this connn progress of Deputies.  They have bn. on fringes of subject for Cttee of 12.  Have tackled subjects which wd. ordinarily be handled by Ministers.  They can’t get anywhere.

		Ch/Ex. shd. therefore be there.



P.M.	Prob. need a M/State at Ty., as at F.O.



		Agreed in principle:  Ch/Ex. to be main repve.  Consider further who “alternate” shd. be.



P.M.	Memo. (Annex I) may be a little pessimistic.



			                                             [Enter N.B., G.S., &amp; Solr. Genl.

5     Persia.



P.M.	Exp. Order.  Strong repn to Shah made.  Amb. seeing him this p.m.

	Message to Truman.  Read reply (3115).  Takes us no further.

	U.S. refuse to support use of force.  Have to see Oppn leaders this p.m.  I said:  “We have no intention of leavg. Abadan.”

		Didn’t say we wd. stay there in all circs.

	What is legal view?



Solr. G.	Read A.G.’s opinions (Tel. 153 Hague).



P.M.	That is the law.

	What are possibilities?

i)	Effect on P. opinion.  Doubtful wtr. it wd. be salutary in ’51. – risk of uniting nationalist feeling behind M.

ii)	Wd. have to stay on.  Work refinery.  Cdn’t do it w’out co-opn of P. people.

	I don’t favour use of force.  Shd. lack support of U.S. &amp; others - &amp; success is doubtful.

	Humiliatg. to be pushed out.  But we still control tankers &amp; distn:  &amp; we cd. hope still to bring P. to reason.



H.M.	P. tear up contract without consultn with us.  Push our people around.  Steal their personal property.  Pinch Br. asset – now propose to push B. personnel out.  Defied decision of Hague Ct.

	Humiliation to Br. throughout M/E.  Talk now in E. of nationalisg. Suez Canal.

	Shd. go to Security Council either to report use of force or to complain of expulsion.  But no warrant they wd. do anything effective.

	Truman’s message isn’t helpful.

	Shd. we threaten use of force?  Mght. make M. hesitate.

	Effect on Br. public.  “Under this Govt. foreigners are flouting Br. interests &amp; trampling on Br. rights.  We are weak.”  I wd. prefer action. Favour telling M. we won’t have this &amp; shall stop it (implied ‘by force’).



McN.	This wd. please Br. public in Election.  But we wd. be in a jam thereafter.

	H.S. makes d.o.’s daily.  We shd. be brght. to Sec. Council.

	Favour our going to Sec. Council askg. for action to enforce Hague decn.  If Sov. veto that, posn of Truman &amp; U.S. public opinion. wd. be v. difft.

					            [Exit McN.



H.D.	Truman’s para. (2) is explicit.  We can’t flout U.S. – on whose aid we depend so much.

	Tell W.S.C. &amp; A.E. what Truman has said.  He wants to march with U.S.

	13/9 tel.  U.S. deprecate any mil. measures save to protect Br. lives or against a Comm. P. Govt.

	Force wd. be illegal unless evce of danger.  There is no such danger. Support advice of P.M.  Bring the people out.  Go to Sec. Council.

J.	Sympathise with H.M.  But U.S. attitude is of gt. importance.

	Doubtful about legal advice.  Goes too far.

	We can’t do nothing.  Choice:  drastic action or immedte refce to Sec. Council.  Then, if R. veto, we mght. use force.



E.Sh.	Buccaneer cd. go in w’in 12 hrs.			 }C.O.S.

	But, if our object is to protect lives, evacuate them first	 }view         

		For arrival of Br. troops will occasion danger to Br. in Abadan.

	Don’t go to Sec. Council.  P. wd. flout an unfair decn:  &amp; a fav. decn wd. not help us.

	My plan:  Mexico.  No-one suggested use of force.  Br. &amp; U.S. personnel had to leave.  But we broke off dipl. reln.  That, I think, is only action we can take.  Followed by economic sanctions.



R.R.S.	Can’t use force w’out U.S. backing in absence of violence to Br. lives.

		Use force &amp; we shan’t succeed.

	But, if we have, we shan’t get back.

	I favour Truman (3) viz. feed in a better alternative proposal thro’ the Shah &amp; leave him to deal with M.

	50/50 won’t do in Persia because they’ve had a worse basis for so long.



H.S.	Can’t use force w’out U.S. support.  Reject that.

	Tell Shah tht. we are not rigidly tied to 50/50 basis, if that’s real trouble.  But if Br. expelled, we shall on same day w’draw Ambassador, go to Sec. Council &amp; apply extreme econ. measures.



A.V.A.	Public here wd. not understand it if we did not go to Sec. Council.

	Favour J’s course.  If we can’t use force (wh. I regret) we shd. go at once to Sec. Council.

	If we don’t, what next?  Will R. come in?  Will U.S. Cos. be free to supply technicians.



P.M.	If R. came in, it wd. be easier for us to act – and U.S. also.



T.W.	Support H.S. view.



C.E.	Must go to Sec. Council.  Favour fresh offer.



N.B.	No use of force in these circumstances.

	New offer.  We can improve on earlier one.  But don’t make the offer to M.  Do it thro’ the Shah.

	Go to Security Council.  Statute of Hague Ct. gives us right to ask Sec. Council to enforce their decision.

	But, before going there, await result of U.S. demarche in Tehran.

		And tell U.S. first.



H.G.	Go to Sec. Council if we can be assured we shan’t get slap in face.

	W’drawal of Amb. wd. cut us off fr. Shah.

	Don’t make fresh offer until we have Truman’s next message.

		Or prs. until U.N. mediator appointed.



A.R.	Sec. Council.  No further offer.  If we break off dipl. relns, use force to prevent P. use of our plant.



H.S.	State publicly tht. if Br. prs. expelled, we shall go to Sec. Council etc. etc.

		And tell Shah privately we will go better than 50:50.



G.W.		1)  Force wd. upset Comm.

		2)  Mayn’t get fav. decn in Sec Council.  Depend on India.

1)	Go to Sec. Council w’out delay.

2)	Tell Shah as H.S. proposes.



H.G.	Work out cost of new offer.

	Compensn is prs. a better thing to make concession on, rather than 50/50 principle, wh. affects other fields.



P.M.    	Tell Shah

		a) going to Sec. Council

                      x |	b) we are prepared to consider better offer if we have

    reasonable people.

		c) canvass support of other countries.

		d) tell Shah what we’ll do if it breaks excludg brkg. dip. relns.

		e) enlist interest of Aga Khan  (R.R.S.)



H.M.	Comments:  don’t put ourselves in posn tht. we can’t act anywhere w’out U.S. consent &amp; approval.

		don’t rely too much on the Shah.  He hasn’t much authority or influence.

		don’t depart from 50/50 principle.

		don’t bring B. personnel out before last day.

		don’t break off dipl. relns: useless.

	Go quickly to S. Council.



E.Sh.	Must state my dissent.

	We have floundered around all thro’.

	Suppose we “succeed” at Sec. Council, what then?  Will P. give way?



P.M.	Council is enforcement body.  U.K. mght be authd to enforce Court’s decision.



E.Sh.	Still favour breakg. off.



P.M.	Don’t w’draw until last moment.

	No force save to protect lives [unless Sec. Council ruling helps us]

	Go to S. Council – telling Truman in advance.

	Tell Shah we are going to do so:  &amp; ready to talk to reasonable Govt.



		P.M. (with H.M. &amp; H.G.) to see W.S.C. &amp; A.E.

	Locomotives.  Memo. approved.

					     [Exit 3 invitees	

6     Prorogation Speech.



Order:  Peace first &amp; re-armament later

Malaya: “further” progress.

P. 2. third para.  B/T. to consider.

				     R.R.S. 

				    

7     Tshekedi Khama.



H.M.	Wise to excite pol. feeling about this before Election.



P.M.	What excuse for not publishing?



G.W.	None.



A.V.A.	Unusual to publish a decision in course of Dissolution.



G.W.	Local diffes in Bechuanaland if this is delayed.

	The reports support our policy.



P.M.	Get Election running &amp; it won’t be noticed.  Somewhere after 10th Oct.



			Agreed:  no publication.



					[Enter M.W.

8     Agricultural Prices.



T.W.	Can’t avoid special review.



H.G.	Nothing need be done until 10/10.  Doubtful if sp. review is justified.  If we say there will be, it’s known that prices will rise.  Why say it before election.



H.D.	Promise of a review doesn’t commit us to conclusion.



M.W.	We must on 10/10 say that we accept or reject principle of a special review.



H.D.	Avoiding commitment to any specific increase.



			Agreed:  T.W. and H.G. to find a suitable formula.

			               Failing agreemt. another Cab. next week.





This was the last Cabinet meeting before the General Election of October, 1951, after which M. Attlee resigned and M. Churchill was invited to form a Government.
