C.M. 50 (51)					9th July, 1951



1.	     Plasterboard.

			                                                           [Enter W.W. &amp; Brown



P.M.	Lamentable failure to vote on Thursday.  Discipline.

	Order not approved by any Cttee?



G.B.	No.



P.M.	Ques. of principle – differentn



G.B.	W’in terms of 1946 statement.



P.M.	Not by statutory order.



J.	Bad to fix prices at wh. inefficient firms make profits.



B.	Only one competitor.  If I drove him out, I wd. create monopoly.



G.B.	We encouraged firm to excessive expansion.

	Also, they have to buy raw materials fr. their competitor.



R.R.S.	Margins earlier too wide.  Limit of 10% on capital – set by me.

		Now 171/2% for smaller firm.  The other wd. have made about 22%. Hence differential.



H.G.	Diff. problem.  In war, we shd. have done this – or worse, by cost plus.



H.D.	Strongly favour re-introducing this order.  Vital qua housing costs.

		W’out this order, another £7 on Orlit house.

		This is unusual – but desperate remedies are required.

		Order lost, not because Tory arguments, but because poor Labour attendance.

	Don’t weaken on any aspect of price control.



T.W.	Agree – if we recognise respons. to this firm because we encouraged their developmt.



C.E.	M/W made a good case in H/C.  But arguments don’t matter in H/C with our present vulnerable majority.  This is matter of Party discipline.  Shall need 3 line Whip, as over Cheese Order.

	This might cause H/L. to intervene.  Must be certain we can carry this in H/C.



P.M.	This is innovation.

			                                                             [Exit W.W. &amp; Brown

			                                                            [Enter N.B., B., Att.G.	



2.	     Persia.



P.M.	Proposing to accept Hague Court decision &amp; appoint the 2 Bd. members – both shd. not be Co. men.

	Y’day’s exchanges with Acheson.

	A.’s proposal to send Harriman to Tehran to press P. Govt. to accept Hague Ct. decision.  P.M. decided, in my absence, to accept in principle but stressed tht. H. shd. not go as mediator but to press for acceptce of Hague decn  w’out modifications.

		W’ton 2098. gives A.’s views.  Nothing more yet received.  Wd. be helpful if I’m free to refer to this in H/C. this pm.  Parly sitn may deteriorate:  Salisbury is out of line with W.S.C.  U.N. inhibits us in f. policy.  Att.G  has advised tht. any forceful action wd. bring us in conflict with U.N.

	Co. ciphers (not now in use).  Tehran offices raided:  Co. repve refused to hand over ciphers:  they are now in safe &amp; Co. have the key.

	P. Govt. haven’t yet told us they reject Hague decision.  But must assume they will.

	More interference with Co. men.



P.M.	We need a memo. now on pro’s &amp; con’s of takg. military action.  Situation growing v. tense.



G.W.	We only said no overt action until Hague decn.



B.	Shipping favourably placed now.  Ship due at Pt. Said Wedy.  Wd. take much longer if these chances slip.    Shd. have to consult A. &amp; N.Z. Govts. because these are migrant ships.



H.D.	i) Drake?  Wasn’t he wrong about morale?



H.M.	It’s tactics.  Co. want to use w’drawal as bluff to frighten P. Govt.

		That is their main motive.



H.D.	But also morale is not so good as D. suggd.

	ii) Supplanting Mussadeq?



H.M.	That’s not being overlooked.



P.M.	Diff. to tell wtr. a move from us wd. frighten P. Govt. or stiffen them.



H.G.	Shall be faced soon with need for decn re evacuation of Co. staff.

		But must wait a) for Harriman  b) for P. Govt. to reject Hague decn.



P.M.	Tell W.S.C. or A.E. about Harriman.



J.	Memo. on

i)	appln to U.N.

ii)	seizure of Abadan

iii)	blockade.



H.M.	Courses.

		a) w’draw Co. staff, by Govt. decn.

		b) Security Council: ask them to call on P. to honour Hague decn.

		c) Ask Iraq permn to send troops to Shaiba now.

		d) Ask Kuwait &amp; Bahrain for leave to send troops there.

	Att.G. has advised tht. we have no legal power to intervene forcibly, to protect A.I.O.C. property.



Att.G.	Risk in b).  Wd. not be procedural &amp; decn cd. be blocked by veto.  Then by United Actn for Peace Resoln it cd. come before Assembly – doubtful if we’d get majority there.



A.V.A.	On J.’s (ii).  Pol. feeling in Parlt.  Salisbury means protectg. B. subjects at work.  U.N. wd. make trouble over that.  But no we have Hague decn:  cd. we not “protect” in that situation?



Att.G.	No.  Court only recommn by unlawful action.



R.R.S.	Tories (via Hare):  Abadan must not be abandoned:  we must protect chaps running it.



E.Sh.	No offl. evce of serious interference with B. personnel.

	No further action pro tem – while Harriman project matures.

	Mil. opns – seizing Abadan – be sure what that means.  What wd. next slips be.



P.M.	A. &amp; N.Z. shd. be warned we {may need the migrant ships

			                              { must hold the migrant ships in case              	                                  they are needed.



H.M.	We may have to do a mil. opn.  Midget is ready.  In addition, I favour (c) forthwith.

                  y|	On further mil. action, I wd. like to be ready.  Do we mind overt prepns now?



P.M.	Do (c):  don’t ask Iraq first.



E.Sh.	That is our existing plan.



E.Sh.	On y/ we are held back by Cab. decision against overt action.



P.M.	We can go in quickly, if there’s no P. opposn.

	Mil. opns reqd against P. opposn is a v. diff. pair of shoes.



H.G.	Economic Questions.

	i) Steel rails.  Must go on now unless contract dates are to be missed. I’m inclined to give no advice to firm pro tem.



	        		            Agreed.



H.G.	ii) P. Govt. can cash sterling for dollar needs.  They have little sterling save £18m. of their currency reserve.  Now likely tho’ P. will dip into that, tho’ P. legn wd. be needed.  24 hrs. notice, therefore.  We shd. then have to decide quickly wtr. We allow that to be converted in dollars.  We cd. suspend agreemt., in view of P. attitude, &amp; take them off transferable a/c so they cd. use this money only in sterling area.



			Agreed



			Agreed: C.O.S. to make immediate report on need for ships.

			             ( ? ) Tell Doms. We may have to use them.	



H.D.	Why not tell U.S. about major mil. opn?



H.M.	They have had a hint.

					[Exit Barnes



3.	     Germany:  End of State of War.



H.M.	Are announcing to-day tht., in conjn with France &amp; U.S., we are ending state of war with Germany.

	In accordce with earlier Cab. Decn.  Memo. dated 6/10/50.



Att.G.	Won’t affect statutes expd in terms of “emergency”.

	Will affect only common law.

	It’s mainly political.



C.E.	Will increase case for bringing emergency legn to an end.

					           [Exit Att.G.

					      [Enter G.S., H.

4.	     German Coal &amp; Steel Industry:  Ownership.



H.	Decn has gone r. us.

	Shares can be put on market.  Other cos. can follow same course.



J.G.	Stewart &amp; Lloyd’s has this interest.  What effect on our natl industry.



G.S.	None – none of public cos. had an interest.



			Memo. noted:  C.P. 165.



	Law 27.  C.P. 186.



H.	Shd. we apply compulsion?  No-one agrees with us.  But this ques. will go to High Commn.  We shall be voted down there.  We ought to go on record as opposed:  &amp; reserve right to make our posn clear publicly when the row breaks out.

P.M.	This = defeat of all our views on G. heavy industry.



J.G.	This will put the Germans of 1930 into power.  We shall never export r. their subsidised competn. – Westphalian Syndicate will re-emerge.



N.B.	I regret this too.  But Schuman Plan shd. prevent what J.G. fears.

		We shall have to make workg. arrangemt. with Schuman high authority.



H.G.	Memo. lets out some units.  Step away from natl:  but not in direction of  centralisation.

	B/T. fear this may increase our diffies over scrap – presumably because this attitude will offend G.



G.S.	Don’t think it matters to offend G.  We can only get things out of them by showing strength.



H.D.	How does this link with G. re-armament?  McCloy is at work again.



H.M.	Social Democrats are gaining ground in Germany.

	

			Equally reluctant note taken of C.P. 186.

					     [Exit H. &amp; G.S.





5.	     Man-Power for Mines.



N.B.	Need for high out-put next winter.  Methods –

1.	morale

2.	machinery &amp;

3.	men.

	On a) – pensions scheme is through.  N.C.B. apptmts have had good Press.

	On b) – C.E.P.S. etc., are helping.

	Their remains c).  Housing:  I’m in touch with M/L.G. &amp; P.

		Irish:  trouble with N.C.B. who find they don’t stay.  But I’ll press it.

		Italians:  a good start:  pushing on.

		Forces:  M/D. concessions wdn’t suffice.



P.M.	What progress in increasg. productivity in mines.



N.B.	V. slow return for investment.  £107m to date.  But 210 m. now as cpd. with only 170 odd in 1945.  O.m.s. has risen.  1.21 as cpd. 1.00 in 1945.



E.Sh.	Have stopped recruitg. in mining areas.

	Have undertaken to remind miners offering to enlist of importce of mining.

	Have refrained fr. re-calling miner reservists, incldg. class Z.

	Effect:  2.000 men to mines.  V. substantial contn.

	Why does M/F. &amp; P. look always to Forces?  What of redundant labour in distribution trades etc.,

	Ready to accept extension of these arrangmts. for another 2 months or so.

		But cdn’t accept proposals in memo. Para. 18.  On a) the man wd. not be valuable miner. On b) he will be a valuable soldier.

	Substantial recent drop in Army recruitment.  They want a new campaign.  If we can’t get regulars, we shall have to continue calling up reservists, with all the pol. trouble it involves.



A.R.	Support M/D. generally.

	On recommns in para. 23.

		b) we cd. help - £5.000:  but we shall be £20.000 shy.



P.M.	Home Informn Services Cttee shd. consider this.



A.R.		c) limiting factor is ability of N.C.B. to absorb.  Up to them.

		d) extension of Scheme for 2 months.

		e) can’t support this – agree with M/Defence.

		f) we have told natl indies the opposite:  can’t support this 				recommn.

		g) we can pick them up now in 21 days:  can’t improve on that.

		h) can work a scheme with Boland.

	The men are not being up-graded to the face quickly enough.  They are leaving even while of mil. age. – riskg. mil. service instead of mining.  Reduce propn on “day. tel” work:  that shd. be Houldsworth’s first job.



T.W.	Re-organisation p’pones increase in propn of face-workers.



R.R.S.	Absenteeism.



N.B.	1) Much lower than it has bn.  1 day a month per man is average.

A little higher with piece-workers.

	Varies from district &amp; pit.  Some black spots e.g. in Yorks.

	Pit-level campaigns are going on.

	2) Wastage:  much lower than in other industries

Personal management is answer.

	3) Up-grading. 4.000 this year.

	

		But takes time to plan face-room.  Am pressing this.  N.C.B. are working at it.



	Hope Cab. will accept all my recommns save (e) &amp; (f) of para. 23.

		On (e):  I wd. only add tht. in autumn everyone told me there was nothing in this.  We have got 2.600 in fact. – 1.200 having arrived.  This helps to get N.U.M. lodges to accept Italians.



J.G.	Cd. you get back 40/50 year old who went to other industies in the depression.  By saying they wd. be under pensions scheme.



			Agreed:  Para. (d) for 2 months.

			               Reject (e) and (f).



H.M.	Stress for economy in use.
