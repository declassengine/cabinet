C.M. 45(51).				21st June, 1951.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  N.B., W.W.



C.E.	Business for the week.





	2.	Bamangwato Tribe.



C.E.	New Motion by Tories.  Supply formal, then debate on Motion.  

		Demands clear reversal of policy.



J.	Debate coming on also in H/Lords.



H.M.	Wd have preferred a Party mtg. before this is debated in H/C.

	Try to re-arrange business to make this possible.



G.W.	If we allow Seretse back, diffies with Union will be increased – at time

		of Def. mtg.  Can’t say this in public:  cd. we use in private with

		some supporters argument tht. we shd. lose our Protectorates to

		Union.  For if we were defeated on Tshekedi, we shd. be forced

		to allow Seretse to return.



H.M.	Easier for us to resist T. than S.;  for he’s a rich man &amp; our supporters

		cd. be so persuaded.



C.E.	T. has made a big impression by addressing mtgs. etc.



G.W.	Other side hasn’t bn. put.  I’m sure tribe is on my side over T.



H.M.            x/	Consider (G.W., C.E. &amp; W.W.) approach to individual Govt. 

		supporters.



			Agreed:  i)     Try to re-arrange business to take this on 

			                       Tuesday &amp; have Party mtg. on Tuesday a.m.

			               ii)     Proceed as at x/.

			               iii)    Second spokesman:  J.G. (unless Depl. diffies

			                        prevent) or perhaps P.M.





	3.	Festival Gardens.



R.R.S.	Going well.  £20.000 p. wk. profit on average.

	What may I say re permanence.  If they are to go on after Oct, 

		something must be said before H/C. rises in July.



H.M.	Shd. continue.  Trying to get L.C.C. to get powers.

	Why not say tht., if Ldn. authies want it, we aren’t opposing it.



H.D.	Make sure B’sea are in favour.

		Agreed:   i)  Subject to informal consultn with L.C.C. &amp;

			                B’sea, spk. favourably.

			       ii)  R.R.S. to spk. twice with leave of House.





	4.	Persia.



H.M.	Diff. for me to say in debate what mil. steps we take to protect lives.

	Even more diff. to deal with A.E.’s suggn tht. we must not leave, for

		that really involves war.

	We cdn’t ask Co.’s employees to go on workg. for Persians.  They

		must therefore come out.  Will be said to be a scuttle.

	V. awkward to speak on these subjects in H/C. at all.

	Mil. action to protect property.  C.O.S. say wd. take 3 months to

		mount:  &amp; mobilisation:  &amp; means war.



H.G.	Why not tell A.E. privately what U.S. &amp; Doms. wd. say if we got into

		a war.



N.B.	Must we accept argument tht. if employees w’drawn they will never 

		get back?  Cd. be repd as strong co-ercive action.  P. can’t work

the oil – 4.000 experts needed.  Mght. even be fires or explosions.



H.G.	Can’t leave employees there to be murdered.

	Only alternative is mil. action to defend property:  &amp; don’t want to 

		tell P. (by open debate) tht. we won’t ever do that.



A.V.A.	You cd. move up a heavier cruiser.  Put in some more heavy ships.

		As in ’46.



H.G.	But U.S. was behind us then.  Get A.E. informed of U.S. views.



H.M.	He knows.



N.B.	Attitude of Doms. &amp; U.N. twds. mil. intervention of protn of 

		property.



H.G.	Get a back-bencher to say some of the things H.M. can’t say

		e.g. internatl implicns.



H.M.	Read report of demonstrations in Tehran.

	Women &amp; children have now bn. ordered out.



R.R.S.	B. staff scattered throughout the country.



H.D.	Shd. they not be concentrated.



N.B.	Can’t, w’out stopping flow of oil - &amp; risking explosions etc.



H.M.	Reported decisions taken y’day by Persia group.



J.	Shd. we not stop sending goods (e.g. steel rails) to Persia.



H.G.	Still poss. they may compromise somehow.  Their diffy in doing so

		is own publ. opinion.  We mustn’t yet make that public still

		angrier.  There will come a time when we shd. act.  When 

		tankers are moved out, then we cd. clamp on other reprisal

		action.



H.D.	Can’t we begin to delay shipmts.



H.G.	Perhaps – but cdn’t say so, yet.  No use therefore for debate.

	We cd. prs. stop B. ships sailing to Persian ports.



H.D.	Don’t suggest we will hold it by force, if in fact we can.

				[Exit  N.B. &amp; W.W.

				[Enter  Att.G.



	5.	Validity of Emergency Acts.



C.E.	As in brief.



J.	Any appeal?



Att.G.	Arises also on habeas corpus.

			Took note:  may need urgent action.





	6.	Mrs Felton.



	Not heard.





	7.	Raw Materials.



H.G.	May we immediately start negotns with U.S. on price stabilisation.

	Memo. will be taken by E.P.C.		Approved.





	8.	Four Power Meeting.



H.M.	Put in Tels. 166-168.



R.R.S.	Why can’t we make it clear tht. we are willing to discuss N.A.T., tho’

		not to make it subject of decision.

	Davies is mistaken on this:  Tel. 167, para. 4.







H.M.	Read draft reply, prepared in Paris.

	Not a note.  An agreed formula for oral statement on behalf of 

		3 Powers &amp; designed for publication afterwards.



J.	See arguments r. discussg. N.A.T.  But can’t see posn tht. it can be

		discussed but can’t be on Agenda.  Quibble.  What point is there

		in this?



H.M.	Don’t admit right to question N.A.T. on basis tht. it is cause of tension.

	On Agenda:  you admit view tht. N.A.T. is among causes of tension.

		And tht. C.F.M. has right to pronounce on N.A.T.



J.	Still think it’s illogical.



R.R.S.	It is understood tht. in C.F.M. you can’t put item on Agenda w’out

		implying that it’s a matter for decision by C.F.M.



H.M.	Willing to say:  ready to have it “brought up for discussion tho’ not

		for decision.”



R.R.S.	Under Item 1 of Agenda:  we have always admitted that.  Read out 

		suggested draft reply.



H.D.	Like that.  It’s direct &amp; intelligible.



J.G.	Sov. offer to discuss their Treaties puts us in weak debatg. posn.

	Draft answer may break it off.

	Repeated earlier point:  no break w’out lifting it up to Ministers.



H.M.	Dictatorship must have an enemy:  these mtgs. are being used by R.

		to paint us as enemies.  73 mtgs. in Paris.  Can’t have my Parly

		Secy permanently away.  Believe public is bored with these talks.

	Are Ministers to suffer same fate as Deputies.

	I’m not prepd to submit to that.



J.G.	What public re-action if it’s broken off next week?



H.M.	We are only adjourning – transferring it to dipl. channel.



A.V.A.	Easier to get France now to take a stiffer line.

	Essential thing:  unity betwn. 3 Powers.



J.	Meet w’out agenda.  Because points on agenda involve decision.



H.M.	P.M. disliked that because meant going on basis of Prague 

		communiqué – a defeat.

	This draft wd. repeat our latest offer to meet on basis of what has bn.

		agreed.





			{  Draft reply approved, subject to incorporation of

			{        point made by J. &amp; R.R.S.

	Agreed	{  Also  ?  tht. R. is not willing to have their Treaties

			{        on agenda.

			{  H.M. to broadcast (subj. to P.M.’s consent) to ensure

			{        full publicity on this quibble.





	9.	Japanese Peace Treaty.		[Enter  K.Y.



H.M.	Seen M/T. and he is satisfied re method of handling shipping.

	Our right to re-open is fully reserved.		

					[Exit  K.Y.



	10.	Yugoslavia.



		Memo. approved.
