C.M. 52 (51)					16th July, 1951



1.	     Persia.

			                                                            [Enter P., B. &amp; C.N.S.



H.G.	Met secretly in Paris – with Harriman.  Friendly:  sent personal messages to P.M. &amp; H.M. regrtg. cdn’t come to Ldn. first.  Sees diffies.  I stressed objn to mediation etc.,  He said:  needn’t worry:  U.S. oil cos. are watchg. me:  can’t be too soft.  Financially, he thght our offer reasonable.  Wants convince M. he’ll get nowhere on present basis – oil can’t be sold w’out the Co.

	Two points 

i)	receipts.  He cdn’t see diffy. – nor cd. Acheson.  I said must avoid implicn tht. oil doesn’t belong to Co.

ii)	precipitate in w’drawg. our mission.  Cd. we not have gone on trying.  I said there seemed no hope.

	He may raise these 2 points in Tehran.

	I stressed Hague decn as basis.

	He wants close touch with Shepherd.  F.O. have telegraphed S. to be friendly.

	If Comm. trouble – he said tht. in that event we must secure Shah’s invitn to go in.  If we got that, likely tht. U.S. wd. support us.

	He stressed risk of R. getting into north.  Oil from there wd. help R.

		Doubt if he’s right on that.

	On M/E. generally he thght all of us had done too little on economic developmt.  He was much concerned.  But didn’t get down to detail.  Realises no progress on this with M.’s Govt.

	He mentioned poss. need for someone to go out fr. U.K. – Minister or senior offl.



R.R.S.	R. in north.  They wd. then control whole country because the granary is there.



H.M.		i) 	Refce to U.N.  Re-considering in light of Jebb’s warning.

ii)	W’drawal.  P’poning statement because Harriman.  But Co. have discretion to w’draw individuals &amp; are doing so.  Prob. can’t hold it for long.



P.M.		iii)	Steel rails.  Lr. from B/T.  Ship has gone, on condn they can be recovered.



B.	Cdn’t have stopped the ship w’out gt. hoo hah.  All cargo wd. have had to be unloaded.  Owners wd. do it, if desired, at some port en route, e.g. Gib. Malta. We can stop the rails at Basrah.  About 3 weeks before ship gets there.  The other 2 ships:  loading is being stopped.



H.M.         *	We must consider Thursday.



T.W.	Tawton is making a point about sugar.

P.M.	Why didn’t you hold up ship itself.



B.	There wd. have bn. a storm over that.

					          [Enter Att.G



2.	     Egypt:  the “Empire Roach”.



P.M.	Suggd naval escort shd. accompany ship to Akaba.



H.M.	Strong protest made.  E. replied tht. further answers wd. be given when Corvette returned.  ???? was back on Saty – but no reply yet.

	E. S of S. War has said this is prohibd zone.

	This is terr. water.  They have right to stop, but not interfere as they did.

	They m’tain they are still at war, tho’ armistice., with Israel.

	Not inclined to take any more insults from E.  W’out saying anything, let destroyer be there: 10:1 nothing will happen.



P.	Two channels

a)	Enterprise ch. nearest E. coast is ordinarily used.

b)	Another, Grafton ch., cd. be used we think.

	a) is w’in E. terr. waters.  b) acc. to F.O. is not.  Island of Tiran we say belongs to Saudi:  but E. claim it:  if they were right it wd. be terr. waters.

	Send ship, with naval escort, thro’ Grafton channel.



P.M.	Have T’jordan bn. moved to protest to E. r. this interfce with supplies for Arab Legion?



H.M.	They won’t want to make open protest.



Att.G	Escortg. merchant vessel is not peaceful errand &amp; can’t therefore be done thro’ terr. waters. (Corfu channel).

	May I have time to consider.



E.Sh.	Ridiculous pretence tht. these mght. have bn. arms for Israel:  we wd. never put them in thro’ Akaba.  This is obviously only means of making trouble.  And, in addn, they did unnecessary damage.

	Empire Roach due to leave Suez.  Send her via Grafton passage &amp; send naval vessel at same time.  Not escorting.



P.M.	Do that.  Answer to E:  this is necessary because you can’t control your own Navy.



C.N.S.	Naval ship must be given clear discretion to stop any nonsense if there is any.  I wd. go thro’ Enterprise channel, with naval escort.

	Govt. ships – cleared by E. customs at Suez.



			                                                              [Exit P., B. &amp; C.N.S.



3.	     India.



G.W.	… L.A.K. convened Comm. Repves &amp; said this was more serious than before &amp; he was movg. his troops up.  Situation v. dangerous.

	Nye due back to-night.  P.M. &amp; I will consult with him re action.

	P. may take it to Security Council.



P.M.	Wait until we have talked to Nye.





4.	     Polish Tankers.



C.E.	Comment on Tyne re seizing Polish tankers.  Not quite all favourable to this continuing policy?  Feeling generally supported it.

		Yards are full of orders.

					    [Enter Wheatley



5.	     Judges’ Salaries.



H.G.	J &amp; I have worked on this.  This is final joint view.  He didn’t press me for increases for High Ct. Judges, but convinced me re Co. Ct. Judges.

	Views of H. Shawcross.  Objn to introdn  of 2 rates.  That was a compromise betwn. my view &amp; J.’s.

		Suggest we settle English rates first.



G.T.	Extra work on divorce varied from £50 to £1.100.  Some will get less on higher fixed salary.  



J.	Only one case -  a man who spent almost all his time on divorce.  Average on divorce = £330.



P.M.	Are there differentials in load of work?



J.	No



Att.G.	Based on assumptn of “probation period”: scale system. Is this right?

	Also doubtful wtr. value of Judge increases with time.  Rather the opposite.  This is a bad principle to admit.  V. little money involved.



J.	No case for it save as compromise betwn. £2750 (Ty) &amp; £3000 (me).



P.M.	Compromise w’out a principle may get you into trouble in H/C.



H.G.	50% increase will give rise to awkward repercussions. – as did Chorley.  Will help to avoid these if we cd. hold this below £3.000.



H.D.	Support H.G.’s view.  £2.750 wd. be fair.  If scale is wrong on principle, settle on £2.750.



G.W.	I agree.



P.M.	No defence for the scale.  Doesn’t apply to top people in C. Service.



R.R.S.	Can’t have a Judge who graduates to competence.  I wd. give £3.000.



A.R.	Scale = service increment.  But, if a fixed salary, not above £2750.



H.M.	£3.000 is not excessive – for a responsible job.  Doubt if Met. Mag. shd. go as high as proposed:  Co. Ct. Judge is a more diff. job.

		I wd. put Met. Mag. at £2.500.



J.	For a long time they were equated.  Only Divorce paymt. gives them more.  Don’t want a disparity of more than £330.



H.M.	But many addl duties laid on Judges &amp; none on Mags.



J.G.	But much taken away fr. Judge because W. Compensn.



J.	Rent Acts etc., have more than made that good.

	Also Leasehold.  Also 50% increase in money limit.



Att.G.	We have added similarly to Mags. e.g. under Exchange Control.



J.	Real criterion:  what is required to attract right type of man.



Att.G.	Good juniors earn more than these figures.



H.G.	Always have.  Never possible to get fliers for these jobs.

		Men ready to take Co. Ct. jobs are not likely to succeed spectacularly at Bar.



E.Sh.	Need we be afraid of paying £3.000 to good men for these jobs?



A.V.A.	We must pay for competent men to staff the cheaper courts we want to make available to the poor.



T.W.	Don’t be afraid of doing what is right, for this valuable Service, by reason of what criticism workers may make.

	Workers’ restraint.  These salaries haven’t moved since 1937.

		What rises have workers had m’while.



H.G.	2/3rds pension after 20 years.  That is v. valuable.

	£2.750 + this pension shd. get the right men.

	Above that, you’ll have trouble with the Party.



J.	Co. Ct. jurisdn is to be increased by 50%.  This wd. justify 50% on salary.



H.M.	Not a sound argument.



			Agreed:  Flat salary of £2.800.



	Scottish Points.



Wh.	a) Expenses for High Ct. Judges.  They get none now, ever since salaries fixed at £3.500 in 1880.



H.G.	I wasn’t going to fix it at 30%.  I’m ready to argue on detail.



			Agreed:  Ld. Advocate to discuss with H.G.



Wh.	b) Sheriff Substitute.

	I find it diff. to get the chaps.  Has always bn. paid less than Co. Ct. Judge.  Can’t defend the differential any longer.  Can’t find a good reply.  They do so much more work.  Concurrent jurisdn with High Ct.  On criminal side, they go up to equivalent of Q. Sessions.  Also bankruptcy.

	Grades A &amp; B be merged at £2.800.

	Grade C, lower rate.  But aim at re-distributing functions to shin off nos. in Grade C.



H.G.	Six grades.  3 Sh. Substitutes, &amp; 3 others.  Wh. leave last 3 in posn nearer others than now.  Sh. Principals won’t get nearly as much more than they did.  Won’t they ask for e.g. £3.500?  Then you are in area of High Ct. Judges at £3.600.

                  x|	Tho’ scope is wider, much of their work is same as J.P.’s in E. &amp; W.

	They are better off in pensions:  they get 3/4.

	What can Sc. barristers earn?  Much less than Ldn.  This justifies the differential.  If criterion is:  need to get right recruits: this must be conclusive.



Wh.	Merits.  Past injustice doesn’t warrant present.

	The 6 grades.  At £2.800 much of this diffy. disappears.

	Dispute x/.

	Pension.  3/4 only after 20 years.  Doesn’t qualify at all until 10 years. (as cpd. 5 in E. &amp; W.)



P.M.	This is not the moment to dispense with differential.



H.G.	And the figures involved (e.g. increase of £1.100) will be v. striking.

	If you must drop the differential, time to do it is not when salary increases are being given.



			Agreed:  H.G., J. &amp; Wh. to adjust figures on basis of preserving differential.

			 Wh. may say it’s w’out prejudice to later argument

	                re differential.



	Met. Magistrates.



J.	I’m in v. gt. diffy.



H.G.	£500 is a fair rise.



P.M.	I sympathise with J.



			Agreed:  £2.500

				      [Exit Wh., Att.G.



6.	     Dunkirk Memorial.



P.M.	Ships, not the men, are to be commemorated.



A.V.A.	Shd. be 3 Service.



R.R.S.	Need it be obelisk with names?  Cdn’t it be somethg. useful?



E.Sh.	Not keen on having anything at Dunkirk, unless on beach.



			Agreed:  Nothing.
