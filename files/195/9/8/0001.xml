C.M. 30 (51)					23rd April, 1951



1.	Historic Houses.



A.     	This plan is more in accord with Labour principles.

	No need to elaborate.



T.W.	Where land associated &amp; Ty. money made available for purchase, land shd. be administered by Ag. Commn.



			To be considered.



H.McN.	Special Scottish aspect.





2.	Persia.

					     [Enter N.B.

H.M.	Tudeh Party seem to favour natn in south but not north.

	We must have the oil.  B. trains &amp; money have developed it. Can’t be pushed around in M/E.

	But must have regard to nationalist feeling. Can we recognise principle of natn while securg. our ends.

	Para 4 (i) is best of the alternatives.

	Conflictg. reports re Persian determinn to go on with this.

	Talks with State Dept.  Have seen McGhee &amp; spoken strongly to him.

		But U.S., tho’ not favourg. natn in U.S., urge us to agree to it in Persia. They need to be watched.  Primarily our concern.

	Furlonge has reported against sendg. a Minister to head Mission.

		U.S. think H.M. Amb. shd. negotiate.  I’m not so sure.  U.S. fear tht. we may run into stiff opposn if we don’t make a gesture twds. natn.

	P.M. doesn’t want a junior Minister to head mission because there may be initial failure.  Wd. seem to stake our credit on success.

	My reason for suggesting a Minister - Majlis might get committed before we talk.

	Either leave it to Ambassador or think of another non-Minister.



H.D.	Amb. supported by co. &amp; others.



H.G.	Agree with P.M.  Co. must be represented:  can’t be alone.  Prestige objn to Minister.  Someone like Radcliffe.



N.B.	Must ensure the oil supplies.  Control over refinery essential.

	Govt. must take charge of negotns.  Minister at right moment:  for stakes are high.

	Co. have shown no imagination.  Shd. have settled small labour troubles much earlier.  Recent visitor tells me Co. in Ldn. were warned by their men on the spot.  Then proposals wh. Co. wd. accept now wd. have settled it.  All last year Co. stalled &amp; refused all further concessions.

	Amb. has under estimated strength of nationalist feelings.

		Persians are not getting anything like as much out of this as we.

		Wasting asset:  world’s resources of oil will run out in 70 years.

	U.S. apprecn has bn. more realistic than ours.

	U.S. wd. be neutral on para. 4(i).  They wd. support 4 (iv). If therefore (i) is put fwd. door shd. not be closed to makg. a better offer later.



H.M.	Danger of (iv) to tht. Persia controls the oil.  V. risky.



A.V.A.	Lesson of Mexico.



H.M.	Series of retreats – effect on B. prestige.  I won’t be pushed around.



J.	Send mission to explore the ground.  May find 4(i) isn’t on.

		Can’t commit ourselves now to either solution.



H.M.	We start fr. existg. agreemt.  If we had enough force, I wd. stand on that.

	If necessary let Amb. do it:  if we can’t find a distinguished &amp; able outsider to head the Mission.  No Minister.

	The revenue fr. the oil:  shd. like to get it made a condn tht. money benefits the lower classes.



H.McN.	No Minister.  Don’t leave it to Ambassador – he has to live with the Persians hereafter.  Put an outsider at head if you can.



G.W.	Try to line up Comm. Govts.  Want to tell old Doms. now &amp; new ones when negotns start.

						 [Exit N.B.



3.	Japanese Peace Treaty



a)  Individual Claims



H.M.	As in memo.



J.G.	Strong Col. feeling.  Statement will have to be conveyed to Col. Govts.:  for they have some Jap. assets totallg. approx £51/2 m.

		Assigned h’to to war damage costs.  Must consult Govts. &amp; confer with Ty.  For if we do this here, we can’t easily stop them doing the same.



J.	Physical assets of individual Japanese?



J.G.	No:  in hands of Custodian/Enemy Property.



H.M.	Wd. propose to consult Doms. &amp; Col. Govts. before statement made.

		Must get quick answer – less than 3 wks.



H.D.	Shd. have preferred no statement.  If one is inevitable, it shd. be much shorter.

	C.O. statement is new informn.



H.McN.	But Col. money has bn. set against war damage costs.



A.	Why make a statement at all in advance of Treaty discns.  Bad politics to get this out in isolation.



C.E. 	Parly. pressure for it.  283 signatures to Motion.



H.M.	And early statement has bn. promised.



H.D.	Can say it will be considered:  but diffies:  will see what we can do.



E.Sh.	Claims by ex p.o.w.  Diff. to confine any benefit to Jap. p.o.w.

		Demand on Ty. wd. follow from German p.o.w.  Can’t discriminate.

	Must therefore make it clear you can’t provide by Peace Treaty for ex p.o.w.

		That is the duty of the Govt. – from their own resources.  And that is what U.S. have done.



H.M.	How cd. you administer such grants?



C.E.	Opposn ready to give a day for a debate on this.  Can’t avoid debate for long.



E.Sh.	Financial claims must be discussed on Treaty.  Don’t tie yr. hands in advance.



H.G.	(i) 	Force an argument v. discriminn betwn. Jap. &amp; G. p.o.w.

(ii)	C.O. point.  must know the facts.

(iii)	Procedure.  Do we say we aren’t going to press in Treaty for further paymt. by Japan?  Can we evade that ques. on debate?



G.W.	Misleading to suggest tht. by pressing we shall get anything out of J.



H.McN.	I don’t accept argument tht. there’s no scope for reparns.

	Don’t qualify our attitude in Treaty discns.



                 x|	Accept Motion:  make point (i):  don’t say what will be available:  but 

                   |    		say we’ll do our best to get some funds for distribn.



A.              	Support x/.  Give nothg. away in advance of discussions.  Austr. will want some compensn.  Say:  “we’ll do our best:  don’t expect there will be much:  accept Motion”.



			Agreed:  F.O. to reconsider on this basis.



b)	General Scope of Treaty.



H.McN.	1) Decided we want Peking Govt.  2) Wd. have liked R. participn.

	Can prs. put aside 2).  But what about 1)?  Are we going to tell U.S. we will go on even without Peking.



H.M.	Don’t know.  Peking mightn’t come even if asked.  We cdn’t accept Ch. K. Shek participn.

	But U.S. draft has bn. handed out.  We must cut in quick &amp; put our views.



H.McN.	Para. 4 of Annex C.:  participants.	

	But U.S. intentn is in 2nd round to discuss with F/E. Commn Powers.

		And Ch. K. Shek is repd there.

	Do we m’tain our view tht. we won’t discuss unless Peking invited.



E.Sh.	Premature to be dogmatic on that now.  First need is to reconcile our views with those of U.S.



H.McN.	Dishonest to go along with U.S. while this is unresolved.



G.W.	Antarctic. We shd. not agree with U.S. to drop this.  Para 5 (e).

	Point shd. be reserved for further argument here.



H.McN.	Commd to Australia to press the point, I think.



H.G.	Para 5(i).  Gold.  We shdn’t give this away in advance.

		We shd. start by askg. for our share.



J.G.	Col Govts. must be free to take some decns themselves.  Will send in details.



H.McN.	War Guilt &amp; Uncondl Surrender.

	U.S. want to be tender to Japs.  We shall look foolish if we accept U.S. view.  Embarrassmt. to our Asian friends.  Any how in fact they are guilty.  Nor are pol. advantages all one way.   Some A. &amp; N.Z. opinion will be against us, despite Pacific Pact.



A.	Support that view.  J. aggression.  Suffering.  U.S. are takg. a v. short. term view of J. friendliness. 



G.W.	War Guilt clause needs thought. Dangerous to include it.



H.M.	Political realism.  We must get some friends.  G. &amp; J. are both needed on our side rather than R. side.

	What value in declaration of war guilt.

	German Treaty Versailles was sole precedent for doing this – and did it do any good?



J.	No:  it did harm.

	And v. inappropriate in a “soft” Treaty.



G.W.	Indian people wd. at least be divided on this.  Many wd. deplore a War Guilt Clause.  Many wd. think it western attack on East.



			Memo approved.





4.	O.E.E.C. and Council of Europe.



H.D.	Wd. be starchy to oppose Cttee too long.



H.G.	Better suppress it if you can.





5.	Berlin Youth Rally.



J.G.	Let it go.  People will think it’s Hitler over again.



G.W.	No public cinema wd. show it.



H.M.	Shall we let it be licensed &amp; leave it to take its course.

		Tho’ I still think it might mislead a lot of young people.
