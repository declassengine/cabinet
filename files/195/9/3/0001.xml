C.M. 25(51).				9th April, 1951.



	1.	Meat:  Argentine Negotiations.	[Enter  M.W.



H.G.	200.000 t. in next 12 months, of wh. 35.000 t. wd. be chilled.

		Side-payment:  possible &amp; preferable, but we mayn’t get it.

	Average price above the £120.  Tho’ they now deny that was an

		average.

	They began at average of £146.

	Tough:  tho’ not so tough as failing to get the meat.

	Recommend acceptance.

	Other matters going reasonably well, tho’ A. makg. diffies.



M.W.	Support this.  Worse to face diffies of no meat, than those of high

		price.  Corned only 2 wks. above zero reserve mark.

	Home supplies coming in well.  Can go to 10d for a few weeks.  And

		can hold status quo until May.  June will be dangerous.  After

		that can look to 1/7 or 1/8.  But next winter wd. be v. diff. w’out

		A. supplies.

	Immediate supplies will depend on shipping.  If it moves quickly, we

		might get up to 10d in June.  But losing N.Z. meat m’while.

	Bound to mean higher price for A. &amp; N.Z. meat.



H.G.	But a 3d per lb. on retail prices wd. cover all this extra cost (excldg.

		still more for A. &amp; N.Z. meat).



H.M.	Increases in retail prices of meat will come up to Cabinet again.



			Agreed:  authorise acceptance of A. offer.





	2.	The Budget.



			Note not taken of details.
