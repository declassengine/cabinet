C.M. 24(51).				5th April, 1951.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  W.W., Att.G.



C.E.	Business for next week.

	Debate on N.A.T. Commands.  Opposn want debate on 19/4.  Don’t

		want incomplete W. Paper.  M/D. will try to get Med.

		Command settled by then if he can.



E.Sh.	Standg. Group are being diff.  But discussg. with Mil. Repves Cttee.





	2.	Detention of Chinese Tanker.	[Enter  B., H., C.O.S.



J.G.	i)	Possible resignn of unoffl. Members of Leg. Council.

	ii)	Risk of internal disorder in H. Kong.

	We can requisition.  Ch. Crew wd. have to be taken off.  Ship shd. be

		cleared out of F/East altogether.



H.M.	Nothing new save (ii).



A.	This action wd. cut across general policy - &amp; wd. be unnecessarily 

		provocative.



C.N.S.	So long as she is in H. Kong, may be trouble.  She shd. not go into

		Chinese hands:  she shd. go fr. H. Kong as soon as possible.

		Diff. to justify to Br. Troops handing over tanker to Ch. V. whom 

		they are fighting.



A.B.	Cd. we not start discns with Ch. Re their confiscn of B. property:  and

		keep the talks going?  I have had evce tht. its requisition will

		cause real trouble, locally.



B.	Disproportionate repercussions on B. interests.



E.Sh.	What about the row (from U.S. etc.) if we do let this tanker go.

	Wd rather have trouble with Ch. than with U.S.



H.M.	Trouble with A.B.’s suggn is tht. m’while tanker wd. remain in

		H. Kong.

	Apart from U.S. criticisms, there will be Parly criticism here.



H.G.	Interception at sea?



H.M.	Only after leaving Canton does she get outside territorial waters.



E.Sh.	Nearly a row in Parlt. y’day re destroyer for Egypt.  And we aren’t

		at war with Egypt.

	Latest Tokyo repts. Suggest large Ch. Counter-offensive.  V. awkward

		if the two co-incided.

Att.G.	Govr’s re-action is “standard”.

	Reactions here wd. be much more serious.



G.W.           x/	Requisition &amp; sail it away.  But then start talks with Chinese about

		cross-requisitiong. of property.



G.T.	I still doubt wtr. This mayn’t extend war v. China.



			Agreed:  as at x/.

			                                      [Exit  Att.G. &amp; B. &amp; H.

			                                      [Enter  R.R.S. &amp; Stevenson.

	3.	Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.



E.Sh.	Def. Cttee approved C.O.S. proposals in (c).  Think we must proceed

		on that basis.  Phased w’drawal:  some this year, more 

		(prs. 4.000) next year.  Combatants.

	Base technicians etc.  C.O.S. want about 3.000.  E. prob. wd. 

		say 2/300.

		May have to compromise on that.

	10.000 R.A.F. wanted.  E. prob. won’t accept that.  But w’out a good

		no. we can’t meet our commitments in M/E.

	Store at Tel-Akabir.  Troops needed to guard it.

	Must negotiate on all these points.  Believe M/E. think we’re weak

		now.  Must try to disabuse them.  But no point in starting 

		v. tough.

	Events of next 18/24 months unknown.  If emergency occurred, sitn

		wd. be diff.  S. &amp; E. wd. have to recognise that.  Wd improve

		our bargaining posn.  Per contra, if peace recurs, easier to w’draw

		grip on E.



H.G.	Fin. Implicns have still not bn. examined.  Figures in C.O.S. memo.

                    *		may be too low.  Wd like this examined before talks with 

		E. resumed.

	Pol. Re-actions here – if we appear to be yielding to E. when nothg.

		secured re Canal &amp; Haifa.

	Diff. posn in M/E. as whole.  Not enough forces to cope.  Diffies in

		Persia &amp; Iraq.  Most vulnerable area in anti-Comm. Cause:

		loss of M/E. oil.  Why handle this as Br. Affair w’out relation

		to N.A.T. &amp; world strategy.  E. dislike us &amp; our troops:  haven’t

		sided with R.  Cdn’t we handle on a wider basis?  If too diff. to

		get U.S. in, what of others?  But what wd. U.S. C.O.S. say?



R.R.S.	They are pro-Egyptian rather than anti-British.

	This is face-saving.  If we offered to go, they’d ask us to stay.

	No Party represents the people.  Lasting agreemt. Wd. have to be 

		negotiated with all Parties.  And somethg. Will have to be done

		re Sudan:  tht. will be essential part of agreemt.

	Mil. agreement.  They will accept large nos. in Canal Zone for base.

		They want a large Army (1. million) with Br. Mission to train

		them.

		Combatants:  free entry in emergency.  But will have to have 

		before ’56.  Anglo-E. air defence organn:  won’t be accepted 

		save under cloak of U.N.



H.McN.	If you pay the price on Sudan you can get E. agreement.  That’s what

		R.R.S. means.  That wd. bring Govt. down.  Also morally un-

		acceptable.

	But we cd. have a decln of policy re Sudan – early self-government

		as our aim.  If we are going to lose on E., let’s win on S.

	If we believe agreemt. Only at price of concessions on Sudan, useless

		to resume on basis of C.O.S. proposals.  I wd. prefer to stand on

		Treaty:  tell them we will consider any proposals of theirs:  but

		make no offer ourselves.



G.W.	We have more to lose than they by such delay.  Where shd. we be in 	’56.  We can only stay in E. by force.  Must therefore ensure tht. we 	have another base in M/E. by 1956.

	Politics:  w’drawal of base isn’t all in E.’s favour.  Putting it in Israel,

		e.g., wd. alter balance of political forces.



A.B.	Can we trust Canal Zone custody to E.  Internatl control of such 

		channels?  Incldg. Panama, Gib., D’elles &amp; Skagerrak.  Need we

		be afraid of that.  Tangle it all up – to avoid going along on a

		Br./E. basis.

	We can’t make any concession on Sudan.

	Our strategic necessities shd. be raised under more respectable 

		auspices.



E.Sh.	Fr. objns to Malta Conference.  Why didn’t we include them? –

		security.

	Widening this out wd. mean in practice widening N.A.T.O.  If E. were

		covered, other Arab States &amp; Israel wd. have to come in.  How 

		wd. U.S. re-act?  Once U.S. intervene actively in M/E., R. wd.

		regard it as provocative.

	These are all v. interestg. suggns.  But we shall have to negotiate.

		We can’t hang on until ’56.

	Alternative bases:  C.O.S. have bn. considering for 2½ years.



A.V.A.	If we don’t resume, E. will denounce Treaty &amp; take ques. again to 

		U.N.	

	Then no prospect of firm U.S. support for action on H.McN. basis –

		staying put in E.



H.D.	Talks shd. be resumed.  F.O. shd. have discretion, as it goes.  Not too

		much restricted to C.O.S. plan.  Haifa must come in.  Militarily

		unsound to move out now, in worsening world.



H.M.        	  i)	Canal is with Security Council.

                	  ii)	McGhee:  I have seen him:  he’s light-hearted about M/E:  I told 		him to be careful.  Am telling W’ton.

  iii)  Genl.  I shd. like to stay.  But can’t act like that in 1950’s.  Think

		we must resume.  Doubt if we shall settle.  I shd. like to spin out

		talks in Cairo, and leave troops there.  Tho’ nos. are in breach of

		Treaty.



A.B.	We must find somethg. that worries E.  Raise internat. waterways

		somewhere else – to frighten them.  They mght. prefer Br. on

		Canal rather than internatl body.



H.McN.	If internatl control is only price at wh. we can keep these waterways

		open, we mght. pay that price.



Stev.	Unless we try for agreemt., there will be show-down.  Denunciation

		of Treaty:  direct action:  we’d be in trouble.  We wd. lose E.

		co-opn.  W’out it, can’t have efficient base.

	No U.S. support for force.

	I wd. like to work twds. getting E. to accept C.O.S. terms.  Not treatg.

		them as ultimatum.  Wdn’t despair of that.

	Sudan.  No ques. of U.K. imposing settlement on Sudanese.  Put E.

		into posn of havg. to refuse reasonable statement re Sudan.

		Our moral posn is strong – tho’ our legal posn is weak.

	Internationalisation (H.G.)  Wdn’t affect E. attitude twds. Presence 

		of foreign troops in E. in peace.

	We can’t stand on Treaty – “wait till 1956” – For we aren’t carrying

		it out.



H.D.	Can’t justify memo. proposals w’out relief on Suez.



Stev.	Diff. to make one condn of another.



J.	                  Play for time.  Spin it out.

	Why not make Canal point condn precedent to resumg. Treaty talks.



St.	They wd. say that was extraneous.  Part of their quarrel with Israel.



E.Sh.	I’m v. introducing it at outset.  Let it emerge if it will.

	Be practical.  I must know where we are.

	Start talking.  Consider seriously alternative bases.



C.E.	Amb. shd. realise tht., whatever issue comes to H/C. on Egypt, vote

		will be taken on basis that tankers are being stopped in Canal.



A.B.	Cd. we have a memo. on pros &amp; cons. of raising international

		waterways.



H.M.	That prob. wdn’t solve Parly diffy.  Negotiatg. while E. are damaging

		B. interests.



E.Sh.	Surely E.B. was negotiating on these lines for months, with 

		knowledge of Cabinet?

H.G.	Let H.M. draft instructns to Ambassador in light of

		Cabinet’s discussion.



H.D.	Canal point shd. be put to E. at outset of discns, tho’

		not as condn precedent.



H.McN.	Serious trouble in H/C. if you appear to be negotiatg. to meet E. 	wishes while Canal is blocked.

			                                          [Exit  C.O.S., R.R.S., Stevenson.



	4.	Additional Measures Against China.



H.M.	Explained memo.

	List A.  Let us stop goods going to H. Kong, so as to spare H.K. Govt.

		task of stopping them from there.

	Para. 12(iii).  The M/D. memo. at E.P.C. is relevant to that.



E.B.	Discussion at “low-desk level”, won’t do.  It shd. be moved higher.

		Call Franks’ attention to that.



E.Sh.	Asked to consider extending embargo.  W. Party recommended

		extended list of items.  Not much diffes betwn. my memo &amp;

		H.M.’s.  Second part of 12(ii):  embodies principle:  ques.

		remains only one of extent.  And, under 12(iii), ques. Of

		timing.

	I am therefore in broad agreemt. with H.M.

	Korea:  diffies are developing.  Latest reports:  Ch. seem to be bldg.

		up large forces (with vehicles) n. of 38th.   Also putting in fresh

		troops.  Reported tht. they may have support of R. aircraft.

		2-engined bombers massing over M’churian frontier.

	We may be forced by such a developmt. to accelerate extended 

		embargo.

	M’while I endorse para. 12 of H.M.’s memo.



H.M.	I also accept M/D. proposals in principle.



H.W.	Large B/T. interest.  But decision is political entirely.  Strong feeling

		here as well as in U.S. if goods pass wh. may help Ch. Troops.

		But we agreed i) no blockade  ii) no driving of Ch. in R. arms.

		This goes well beyond earlier controls:  greater than any applied

		to R.



J.G.	Our policy has bn. to seek settlement.

	We shd. stand on 38th.  Will a Ch. counter attack be made pretext for

		going beyond it.  Advances made n. of 38th:  shd. it not be made

		clear tht. these are for limited purposes only.



E.Sh.	We have made that policy clear.



G.W.	The memoranda are in conflict.  Para. 7 of H.M. memo. puts a 

		v. limited p’mme.  Can’t do less than that – all war-like goods.

		But be careful not to slip into sanctions.  The list in M/D. is much

		more extensive:  &amp; involves real econ. sanctions.  Acceptance of

		H.M. memo. means not acceptg. M/D. memo in principle now.

		If we did, I shd. have to consult Doms.



A.	Endorse that view.



H.D.	Ditto.  Also real econ. sanctions wd. not have support of Eur. &amp;

		Comm. countries.



H.G.	Para. 7(a) – first 4 done.  Ques:  do we accept 5 also.  Adopt it &amp;

		apply it to list in M/D. memo.  Machinery is the big item:

		Dpts. shd. apply criterion suggested.



H.W.	Diff. for us to do alone.  But I wd. accept H.M.’s memo.



			Agreed:  approve H.M.’s memo.





	5.	Yugoslavia:  Economic Assistance.



G.W.	Does this enable Y. to compete for our scarce goods?



H.M.	Let B/T. go into that.



			Memo. approved.



				[Enter  G.A.I.

	6.	Balance of Civil Pay.



H.G.	Ques. of expediency.  Must soon make up our minds.



A.B.	Everyone shd. have it or no-one.

	How deny it to natd industries?



H.G.	You couldn’t.  It wd. have to go to all public service.



A.B.	Cd. we require everyone to make up pay in all cases.

		Make everyone’s pay up &amp; take it away by taxation.



E.Sh.	When arguments are evenly balanced, best to preserve status quo.

	You can’t apply it to all.  A.B.’s plan must mean:  no one shall

		get it.

	If none, must have W. Service Grants.  They are ineffective for cases

		of worst hardship.  Means test.  Mght. cost more.



C.E.	Support status quo.



H.M.	Favour War Grants scheme.

C.E.	Worked v. inequitably in practice.

	Man in ranks:  worse off than in civil life:  sees other men getting more

		in civil emplt. than pre-war:  serious cause of discontent in 

		Forces.

	Examine idea of making everyone’s pay up.			[Exit  T.W.



G.T.	Injustice of existg. system in reln to call-up of Z. reservists.

		Anomalies are arising already.



H.D.	No-one will legislate on this ques. in present session.  Why not

		therefore carry on as now?



G.A.I.	We shd. stand as now.  i)   employers who do it wd.  } Govt wd. then

			                            carry on.                         }  be less than

			                    ii)  Bds. mght. make up pay.  } good employer.

	Politically difficult to do otherwise.



A.B.	Ques. will come up on Reserve Forces Bill.



H.G.	Paras. 7 &amp; 13 need considn in any event.
