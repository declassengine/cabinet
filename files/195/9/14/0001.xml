C.M. 36 (51)					22nd May, 1951



1.	     Manchester Dock Strike.

		                                                       [Enter B., K.Y., &amp; Rowlands

C.E.	As in memo.

	Undesirable to transfer ships to any other commercial port in G.B., as they might be treated as “block”.

	Can’t give orders to these U.S. ships.

	M/D &amp; I think pol. damaging if these ships can’t be unloaded in U.K.  Specially bad if they went back to U.S.

	Men have called mtg. at Manchr. to-morrow:  Police don’t know why:  had bn. mtg. on Sunday next.

	I favour Cairnryan.



A.R.	Disciplinary issue.  Other strikes at B’head &amp; L’pl. on similar issue, started since, have bn. settled.  Manchr. strike may equally be settled w’in a week.

	A week before strike began, Manchr agreemt. made tht. restrictive practice re “overtime ship” shd. be discontd.  But 2 men refused to work new system:  they were suspended:  rest of gang came out.  Cause:  T.G.W. Union haven’t informed men of new agreement.  Rest of dockers then came out.  The 2 men have refused to appeal.  Dock Labour Bd. have urged men to return &amp; work the new system.  I believe strike will end this week.

	Against sending ship to Cairnryan or otherwise using mil. labour on it.

	Not affectg. Supply Dpts.  Ship can go to Antwerp.  Won’t do any real harm.  2,400 on strike out of 80,000 dockers in all.

	C.E.’s proposal likely to have effect of bringing other ports out.

	Allow normal commercial arrangemts. to take ship to Antwerp.



Rowl.	Total less than 1 week’s copper &amp; 2 days zinc.  We are not 	embarrassed.

	Strikes occur all over the world &amp; our workg. stocks are for this purpose.



B.	We shdn’t advise this U.S. Co. what to do.  That wd. mean acceptg. responsibility: for the other ships too.

	Never used mil. labour before save for perishables.

	I support M/L. view.



E.Sh.	U.S. Embassy approached Glynn:  said Co. wd. send ship back to U.S.

	I think it wd. create bad impn in U.S. if shown we can’t discharge r. materials in U.K.  L.P.S. wd. be embarrassed.  Amounts may be small.  But we want to look as tho’ it’s urgent.

	Offl. Em. Cttee thgt. there was a case to come to Minl Cttee.

	Cairnryan seemed a solution.  Cd. discharged 3 ships at once there, with more labour.  Think we shd. suggest that to owners:  it’s for them to decide.  Dockers elsewhere couldn’t complain.



P.M.	T.&amp;.G.W. Union seem to be v. inefficient.  

A.R.	They are.  Especially in getting down to level of ordinary members.  I’m trying to improve that posn.  But unloading this ship at Cairnryan will be considered by dockers as same as using mil. labour in a commercial port.



H.S.	B/T don’t mind delay in unloading their materials.

	But see pol. diffy in divertg. raw mats to foreign ports.  Also disadv. of increasg. delays in shipping.



H.G.	i) Madness to risk bringing out L’pl. or B’head.  There is some risk of  this if mil. labour is used.

	ii) Unwise to suggest to dockers they are going to win – therefore discipline.

	Pol. affairs.  Are they so great?  Diversion therefore strikes is not unusual.

		Antwerp wd. be better than Cairnryan.  But Belfast wd. be better.



P.M.	To what extent do we want to take responsibility – even in advising owners.  Apart fr. food, we shd. be slow to interfere.



B.	We shd. leave it to owners.  Since Friday we have advised owners to take no action.



McN.	Normal commercial opn to discharge at Antwerp.



H.S.	Not after arrival in U.K.  Materials belong to us:  we can advise tht. we prefer Belfast.



G.W.	Leave it to owners – unless ques. of going back to U.S.



			Agreed:  Not Cairnryan. 

			               Govt. to leave it to owners as much as possible –

			                intervening as little as possible.  Indicate 		                preference for Belfast.  M/T. to lift his request tht. 	                they shdn’t move anywhere.

					     [Exit B. &amp; A.R.

					        [Enter C.O.S.

2.	     N.A.T.O. Association of Greece &amp; Turkey.



K.Y.	Earlier, in Def. Cttee, for reasons in para. 11 we have bn. against their admission.  Now in memo, we favour admission, for reasons in para. 12.  But, once more, want some latitude in handling this because views expd by other N.A.T.O. members   esp. French.

		Latitude on timing – also further study, in first instance in Standing Group:  then betwn. 3 Govts.

	We have always thght. N.A.T.O. membership wasn’t best method of getting guarantee of security for G &amp; T.  Only U.S. can give this.  They now say only thro’ membership.

	Turks have pressed hard for membership.  And, as we can’t guarantee their security, awkward for us to oppose a U.S. offer of membership.

	French view

i)	Provocn to R.:  encirclement.

ii)	Don’t like extendg. “automatically” principle to Balkans. (They suspect rashness of U.S. on that.)

iii)	Fr. Elections are near.  No French Govt. cd. accept this until Elections are over.  Govt. have commd themselves to consult Chamber before extendg. membership.

	Hedge therefore with U.S. pro-tem. – tho’ we agree in principle we may have to accept this in the end.

	This is tied up to some extent with Med. Command.  Another reason for delay.



C.I.G.S.	We have come to concln tht. unitarily balance/advantage is in favour of admittg. G. &amp; T. to membership.  Won’t make it more diff. for us to get them (or Turkey) into a M/E. assocn.



P.M.	Grave pol. dangers.  Change N.A.T.O. conceptn into anti-Comm Pact.

		T &amp; G. are not Atlantic, nor v. democratic.  Spain wd. be the next.

	Go v. slow.  No concln in favour – even in principle.  Refer it back.



H.D.	Don’t prejudice Fr. Elections.  Want Turks in, but not necessary in N.A.T.O.



McN.	Giving T. automatic guarantee wd. make M/E assocn more difficult to get?



C.I.G.S.	Wd. increase T.’s readiness to fight.  Wdn’t put off the others.

	T. is essential to M/E. defence.  She has troops, who wd. fight.  That wd. encourage other M/E. States to come in.



E.Sh.	T. pressing strongly.  Charles supports their view.  If they aren’t admitted, U.S. will give unilateral guarantee of their security.  We don’t want T. to look over much to West:  we may need them more in East.

	Mil. implicns need to be worked out more fully.  But U.S. don’t like waiting.  And Turks are pressing.

	French:  always puttg. things off because Elections.  They also want to enter the discns re M/E.:  we don’t want them in.

	“Encirclement” – wd. arise on alternative of U.S. guarantee. (?)

	This is tied up with Med. Command.  Set up we want is this.  Shd. like G.  &amp; T. in N.A.T.O.  Want T. in a M/E Command.  May have to accept Allied Command in M/E., with Br. Supreme.

	Extending N.A.T.O. to non-Atlantic powers.  Don’t think we can prevent it.

		Bound to come.  Or Reg. Pacts in assocn with N.A.T.O.

	H.M. can have room to manoeuvre – but we must placate Turkey.

P.M.	That turns N.A.T.O. into anti-Cominform Pact.



E.Sh.	What else is it now?  And the more countries we add, the better.



A.V.A.	I wd. prefer armed neutrality by Turkey.

	But if T. is admitted, we must safeguard B. control of Cyprus.

		Don’t like possibility of GK. troops into Cyprus.



P.M.	We are too often rushed into things by U.S., w’out adequate considn.

		Not only a guarantee to Turkey.  But multiplies points of friction wh. can lead to world war.  Play this v. slow.



J.	N.A.T.O. is anti-Comm Pact.  Can’t hit R. w’out Turkey.  Inevitable developmt.  But others must be brght. along to recognise this.

		Not only France, but other N.A.T. members.                                    

	But don’t appear to Turks tht. we are obstructg. their membership.



E.Sh.	N.A.T. Council proposed for early July.  We cd. say tht. because mil implicns St. Grp. shd. submit report to council. This wd. avoid seeming to be opposed to Turks.



G.W.	We shd. be pre-disposed in favour.  Play slow – but because best way of getting it, not to put it off.

	We want U.S. in M/E.  Better to get them in via N.A.T.O., rather than by unilateral guarantee to T.

	Want N.A.T. extended.  World war:  need a world organisation.

	Tell old Doms, what our attitude is:  so they can discuss at Malta.



H.S.	I favour a genl. Pact., vice series of Reg. Pacts.



McN.	If you propose an anti-Cominform Pact, you can’t choose who the members will be.

	M/E. Treaty:  prospects bound to be damaged by admn of Turkey.



P.M.	N.A.T.O. is def. organn.  Diff. enough with 12. cf. Commands.  How work that in practice with many more than 12?



G.T.	N.A.T.O. was to meet threat in the West.  Avoid “encirclement”.

	Conceptn of a defensive Pact must be m’tained.  No preventive war.

	Support P.M.’s original view.



H.G.	I accept memo. largely because unsatisf. state of our M/E. defence posn.

           x|	We need effective orgn there.

	Choice:  M/E. arrangemt. or bringing T. into N.A.T.O.

		U.S. arguemts. in para. 4. v. Med. or M/E. Pact are strong.

	Extending conceptn of N.A.T.O. doesn’t worry me.  It is an anti-Comm Pact, tho’ defensive in character.

	G. &amp;.T. are both in O.E.E.C. &amp; C/Europe.  Makes it easier.

	Tho’ I agree to play this slow, don’t give U.S. &amp; T. impn we are r. it.

P.M.	What U.S. want us to do is to give a positive lead.  Can’t do that &amp; also play it slow.



C.I.G.S.	Agree with x/.  And no improvemt. save by incldg. T. in a M/E. Command.

	We want T. in M/E.  Eisenhower &amp; Co. want it in West.

	We can’t defend M/E w’out Turkey.  If war comes there, we must have plans made with T.

	T. must come into some form of M/E defence organn.  Bear this in mind throughout any negotns.



P.M.	We shd. insist on knowg. what U.S. intentns are in M/E. before agreeing to this.



C.I.G.S.	Allied Sup. Comm. in M/E. with Br. Commr.  Latest U.S. suggn.



P.M.	But what troops?  



C.I.G.S.	Only such sea as Ike can spare.

		They think we shd. look after M/E. as they do Pacific.

		But good chance of bringing U.S. forces in if there’s an Allied Command.



E.Sh.	T. in N.A.T.O. wd. bring U.S. in automatically.

	T. won’t enter a M/E. assocn – certainly not w’out U.S. guarantee. or N.A.T.O. assocn.

	Put T. into N.A.T.O.  Then have an Allied Command for M/E. under N.A.T.O.  Then we have all we want.



McN.	Then get it clear with U.S. tht. T. is to have a primarily M/E. role.



H.G.	Then accept U.S. invitn on followg. condns:-

i)	satisfy. arrangmt. re M/E. Command.

ii)	make it quite clear we won’t admit Spain.

iii)	play it slow because Fr. elections &amp; mil. study m’while.



K.Y.	With a month’s delay these points will come out.  But don’t make them express condns.

	Discuss in St. Grp.  Make U.S. clear their minds re T.’s role.

		Let other N.A.T. Powers also be given explns.



P.M.	I want to know U.S. mind on this before we agree.

	Care of U.S. intentns.  They may want Turkey as air base v. R.



			{ Say.  We don’t disagree in principle.

			{           Mil. implicns to be worked out.

			{           Consider Council mtg.





 

3.	N.A.T. Command Organisation.



E.Sh.	U.S. w’drawg. on S.C. Atlantic.

	In Med:  we thght we wd. have Supremo with U.S. naval C-in-C.

	U.S. now don’t like that either.

	We have argued tht. Atlantic is decided.  U.S. may now accept it:  if it’s understand tht. F. is not to be ineffective.

	U.S. won’t accept Br. Supremo in Med.  They insist on U.S. Adml. in control of Eisenhower’s S. Flank.  This corresponds to Brind on N. Flank. 

		We cd. accept it on that basis.

	Then, Allied Command in M/E. with Br. Commr.  We welcome that.

	Only ques. then:  is Carney to control commns in W. Med.  We say “no”.

		Cd. we have Allied Cttee for commns in Med?  Then what of Malta &amp; Gib.



C.I.G.S.	Urgency.  Discns in S. Gp. on Thursday.  Want Cab. approval of our instns to W.E.

	U.S. firm on Carney.

	We have agreed

i)	Atlantic.  Don’t want to go back on it.

ii)	Carney for S. Flank.

	We support in princ.

iii)	Allied Command in M/E.

	We differ on

iv)	U.S. conceptn of Med. as more than one sea.

	To break this deadlock:  we want to propose to U.S. tht. we publish &amp; enforce i) and ii).  with exceptn of puttg. T. &amp; G. into Carney’s orbit.  Want to go on discussg. naval control of Med., for wh. some separate command is essential.  Tell them in favour (iii) covering at least U.S. Br. Comm. &amp; Turkey.



P.M.	V. diff. politically.

	The S. Flank Force operates in waters wh. must be under B. control.

	We can’t have Carney’s apptmt announced in advance of a B. naval Commn in Med.



K.Y.	Can’t expect U.S. to agree tht. Carney shd. be under a Br. Commr. Med.



C.A.S.	With a Supr. Commn M/E. we envisage a B. naval commn for all Med.



C.I.G.S.	Given that, can we accept Carney?



P.M.	Yes:  if all announced together.





 

4.	Move of Paratroop Brigade to M/East.



E.Sh.	Proposing to send Para. Brigade [to Cyprus.]



P.M.	Undue publicity.



C.I.G.S.	“To M/E other than Egypt” vice [].

		More convenient to have them in Tripoli.



E.Sh.	Will start in 7 days – arrive Cyprus 5/6.



P.M.	Can’t you nurse the Press over it:  routine movement.



			Agreed.
