C.M. 44(51).				18th June, 1951.





	1.	Leasehold Property Bill.	[Enter  Att.G.



J.	Diffy:  interval for to &amp; fro’ betwn. Houses shortened by time allocated

		to Fin. Bill.

	Bill in 2 parts.  Pt. II – shops – is generally welcomed.

                    x/	On Pt. I.  3 amendmts give rise to diffy &amp; may need to &amp; fro’ procedure.

	Diffy on Pt. II – people whose lease expired immed. before Act can get

		extension.

		Bill was to come into force on Quarter Day, 25/6.  If because to

		&amp; fro on Pt. I., Bill is delayed, shop leases ending 23/6 won’t

		come under Bill.  Need therefore to get Bill accepted by H/L. on

		Thurs., followg. H/C. discn of H/L. amendmts.

	The 3 amendmts at x/.  i) Durg. 2 yrs’ moratorium tenant can’t be 

		turned out for non-repair.  Landlord may repair &amp; recover after

		the 2 years.  Amendmt:  if l.a. insist on repairs, landlord may 

		require tenant to repair or evict him.  We can’t compromise on 

		that.

			                 ii)  We cd. compromise on a 2nd techn. amendmt.

		Bill applies to occupying tenants.  Said tht. investor mght. enter

		&amp; occupy just before passage of Bill, to get its protn.  Amendmt

		says ‘occupying tenant’:  man who has occupied since introdn of

		Bill.  We cd. suggest a shorter period of occupn e.g. 2 months.

		Shall we, to save their face?



Att.G.	No compromise on either.  Agree on i) with J.  On ii) effect of 

		2 months wd. exclude rare cases of investor lessee.  But you wd.

		also exclude many deserving cases.  Argued in H/C:  &amp; we

		resisted idea of arbitrary period.  Little merit in compromise, and

		doubtful if H/L. wd. be satisfied with it.  Also gt. diffy in gettg. 

		H/C. to accept such a compromise.



H.D.	Stand firm.  Good political case for opposing H/L. on this.

	If R. Assent is delayed, we cd. have retrospve legn later.



J.	Wdn’t be easy.



Att.G.	More than that.  Wd have to bring in further Bill.

				               [Exit  Att.G.

				 [Enter  H., G.S., N.B.

	2.	Schuman Treaty.



H.	H.M. discussed with G.S. as requested.

	Treaty now before Bundestag.  Can’t be carried there w’out assurance

		tht. Allied controls will be lifted when it comes in.  Allied mtg.

		fixed for to’morrow or Wed. in Paris.  Suggd we make our

		agreemt. condl on performance of deliveries under allocn.

		Altern. we cd. make unilat. decln tht. our agreemt. was so

		conditional.

	Anglo-G. trade negotns now current in Paris.  G. have agreed to provn

		tht. def. orders will receive special considn.  Assurances aren’t

		enough.  Need a firm agreement.  G. assessmt. of their condn over

		next 4 months.

	We wd. prefer a unilateral decln.



H.M.	Other 2 Occup. Powers are v. anxious to get decln tht. controls will go.

	We can agree to that but say, before we announce, must have firm

		agreemt. about our steel supplies.



G.S.	I agree.  Course 1 is better – joint decln.  Para. 5(i).  Make it clear tht.

		mere assurance isn’t enough.



P.M.           x/	“adequate performance in fulfilment of ….”



H.S.	Prefer 5(i).  The other won’t do Anglo-G. relns much good.  G. mght. 

		exploit.



H.M.	Try for 5(i).  Take (ii) if we can’t get it.



N.B.	Agree – on all points.

	G. may say they can’t do it because allocns will be by Schuman body.

	Must get on with considn of future.



H.G.	Agree with memo.



H.D.	Agree.  Support x/.  We want steel, not promises.



McN.	Strengthen 5(i) – schedules or arrangemts. satisf. to M/Supply.



			Memo. Approved.





	3.	French Election.



				A.		 B.

H.M.	500 out of 629 seats.                  Comm.	83		104

			                                 Socialist.	88		111

			                                 M.A.F.	71		  90

			                                 Radical	81		100

			                                 4 Force	74		  92

			                                 Gaullist.	99		125

			                                 Misc.	  4		    5.

	3rd Force 240.    3rd &amp; 4th    314  A

		      301                       394  B.

	If propn of later results were the same, results wd. be as shown in

		Col. B.

	Comms. have lost votes as well as seats.  29% in last electn.  23% now.

	Poll was about 80%.

	4.	Four-Power Meeting.



H.M.	Note was sent.  Gromyko taken by surprise.  We got last word before

		Fr. elections.  Fr. Govt. pleased at our help with U.S.

	If R. accept, things go fwd. – appropte date.  23/7 was last one

		mentioned.  Too soon now.  Better to try for October.

	If R. decline, view is we shd. end Paris discns:  all 3 repves agree.

		Can’t justify to public any more talk.  If R. produce an

		alternative, Govts. must consider.

	If rejection:  Davies to state Deputies’ work can’t get further pro-tem:

		further discns with Govts:  but Deputies cd. resume later to

		complete arrangements if necessary.

	If counter proposal:  Davies shd. promise to refer to his Govt.



McN.	Cd we not wait until we see the note.



H.M.	Leave me to judge wtr. it amounts to rejection.



H.D.	If argumentative reply, we shd. be free to send counter-arguments.  For

		propaganda purposes.



E.Sh.	H.M. must be patient.  Public won’t care how long talks continue, if

		they seem to avert war.  Ready too to say U.S. don’t want to

		meet, &amp; have influenced us.



J.G.	Public anxiety.

	Political consequences.

	If Deputies come to end of tether, public wd. expect that not to be final

		&amp; decisive.  Wd want to think Ministers had made a shot at it.

		Before final b’down, H.M. shd. with Acheson have a go.



H.M.	Wd have to be a Parly statement.  Cd. cover these points.

		Wd repeat in H/C. what E.D. said in Paris.  And explain it.



E.Sh.	Get it across tht., while disagreemt. over agenda, this doesn’t

		preclude mtg. of Ministers entirely.



H.M.	Failure of a Ministerial mtg. wd. be even more serious.



McN.	But wd. keep us going until Nov.

	Anyhow, doubt if R. will return a blank negative.

	Pol. danger of abrupt response.



P.M.	Genl. view:  keep it running if we can.





	5.	Japanese Peace Treaty.



H.M.	Statement by U.S. and us – in addn to agreed communiqué – or 

		China’s participn.

	Our draft says future of F. is still to be discussed [in light of Charter 

		of U.N.]  U.S. draft omits [ ].

	Want latitude to explain some differences betw. us.  Emerged tht.

		each Govt. shd. be free to make own statements on these ques.

		U.S. wd. be ready for us to add [ ].  They may say somethg. re

		J.’s freedom to conclude treaties with other States.



P.M.	I was upset by U.S. omission of F. formula [ ].

	Will be assumed they intend to do as they please over F. if we 

		add [ ].



J.	Yes:  divergence of interpretns will be thought to mean more than it

		does.



P.M.	And get U.S. equally to say nothing re bi-lateral treaties.



H.D.	Do a deal on both points.



			Agreed – as P.M. said.
