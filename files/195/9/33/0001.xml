C.M. 56(51).				30th July, 1951.



	1.	Leasehold Reform.	[Enter  Sol.Genl.



J.	Went thro’ memo.  Laid down lines on wh. to proceed.

	Enfranchisement:  can’t discuss in vacuo:  scheme to be worked out.

		Att.G. agreed, &amp; is convening his officials.  Shall submit to

		Cabinet.



H.D.	Agree.



McN.	Ld Advocate agrees.



			Memo. approved.



				[Enter  P.  Wheatley.

	2.	Naval Discipline Act.



P.	Literalising proposals.  Roughly in accord with Army &amp; RAF.



C.E.	No comment.  No bearing on civil penalties.



J.                 	i)	No proposal casting on Judges a discretion wtr. or no to sentence

		to death.  Always thght. this an unfair discretion to give to an

		individual.  Diff. for a ct. martial.  Can’t accept this for a Judge.

		Only want to make this plain.  Admy to check up.

                   	ii)	Section 6.  Enables R.N. to try by ct. martial any spy.  This will 		be raised in Parlt.  Admy shd. look into this.



Solr.G.	Agree re i) – but can it arise.

	P. 3.  Refces to acting traitorously.  Treason = death, mandatory.  Can

		it be said this will make treason less serious in R.N. than

		elsewhere.  Repercussions on civil cases.



E.Sh.	Let us discuss with L.O.’s before introducg. legn.



Wh.	No comments.		[Exit  L.O.’s &amp; P.





	3.	European Defence Effort.



G.W.	No refce to Comm.  Explicit reference to it shd. be included.



H.G.	That was intended.  Memo. looks at Europe.

	Need to raise morale in Europe, esp. Italy &amp; Fr. – where Comm.

		prominent &amp; anti-N.A.T.

	Hope Sept. mtg. will present N.A.T. in more fav. light.  Comms. are

		gettg. too much scope.  “N.A.T. burden imposed on Eur. by U.S.”

		Assocte N.A.T. with social progress.



	Reln betw. OEEC &amp; N.A.T.  Past hostility – Paris focus disaffn

		r. N.A.T.  Econ. Min. trying to prevent Def. Min. doing

		anything.  Sitn improved by F.E.B. &amp; staffing.  Moving better.

		Marjolies to help in F.E.B. work.  Tho’ still Fr. tendency to 

		prevent N.A.T. doing econ. work.



E.Sh.	We did this – thro’ W. Union.  More diff. with N.A.T. because

		12 countries incldg. some reluctant to go on.

	Trouble not with mil. but pol., esp. Fin. Ministers.

	Oscillns in U.S. policy make it worse.  E.g. U.S. promised to equip Fr.

		Forces, materials &amp; money.  Fr. promised 10/15/20 Divns. on

		that basis.  But U.S. haven’t come along with more than a 

		trickle of equipmt.  Shan’t now get more than 5 Fr. Divns. this

		year.



P.M.	Incoherence of U.S. thinking.  Raisg. too many men in U.S. rather than

		strengthening screen in Europe.  Many think Europe expendable:

		many preparing for war vice averting it.  Not in Adminn perhaps.



H.D.	V. disturbing news re France.



E.Sh.	Fr. were waitg. for training cadre fr. Indo China.  They haven’t got

		them back yet.



P.M.	Also short period of training.  Adopted 18 mos. now, but not yet 

		introduced.



H.G.	Delay due to Fr. Govt. or shortness of equipment.



E.Sh.	Both.



H.G.	Can’t press first w’out assurance of U.S. equipmt.  Must press U.S. on

		this at N.A.T. mtg. in Sept.



C.E.	At C.D. Coll., Commandant told me people comg. fr. Eur. countries

		either assume C.D. a form of organising Maguis (assumg. they’ll

		be over-run) or tht. our prepns indicate we expect them to be 

		over-run.  Diff. to persuade them C.D. is part of active defence.

	Is there any real will to resist in W. Europe?



A.V.A.	Hope timing in memo. will work:  delays in Eur. are disturbg:

		&amp; Spaak etc., are trying to lay blame on us:  on pretext of

		Europ. Army delay.  Tho’ we’ve done more than anyone.





	4.	Geneva Conventions 1949.                   [Enter  L.O.’s &amp; H. &amp; J.S.



H.	Four convns signed by us 4 yrs. ago, subj. to a reservn.  Other countries

		are ratifying.  We shd. do so, too, (subj. to prev. reservn) as soon

		as legn can be passed.

	Reservn:  re death penalty for sabotage etc.  W.O. insist tht. we must

		reserve right to impose death for these offences (?).



C.E.	Can’t see how this legn can be promoted here.  Involves amendmt of

		extradn law:  &amp; abandonmt. of princ. tht. we won’t surrender pol.

		refugees.  V. diff. issues.  We have Extr. Treaties with R. &amp; many

		satellites:  but long regarded as not operative.  Case of 2 Poles 

		involved in murder in Hunts.:  one removed on R. ship fr. our

		jurisdn.  We took no steps to get him back because we think it so

		important not to have mutual extradn with R.  We want to secure

		(but can’t enforce) tht. a man be not tried for any offence other

		than that on wh. he was extradited.

	With some other countries involved we have no extradn treaty.

		E.g. Abyssinia, we have refused a Treaty with them because not

		satisf. with their crim. jurisdn.

	Mustn’t allow extradn to be subject determined for us by other Powers.



J.	I don’t like it either.  But gather tht. internatl reasons for ratifying are

		v. strong.

	Death penalty to be delayed for 6 months.  Appalling.



S.Genl.	Para. 15. gives alternatives – seems to satisfy C.E.’s difficulties.



C.E.	Is that so?



P.M.	Yes:  para. 14.



Wh.	i)	Para. 12(b) suggests reliance on Prerog. of Mercy.  In debate over

		cap. punishmt doubt raised re promising in advance to use Prerog.

		Is this constitutionally right.

	ii)	Para. 18.  How cd. we sell this to our Parlt.  Other countries cd.

		take power to try offences commd in U.K.



H.S.	Not universally accepted rule of intern. law.



P.M.	On i) danger is suggn of using Prerog. on foreign policy grounds.



J.	Art. 118 of Civil Convn doesn’t oblige us to use Prerog.



P.M.	We are bound to ratify.  Does C.E. suggest any further reservations?



C.E.	No.  My trouble is:  can Parlt. be persuaded to agree to nec. amendmt

		of our extradn laws.



McN.	Parlt. will be reluctant to make new offences.



J.S.	In event of war, this wd. be of real help to us.



H.	France &amp; U.S. are ratifying now.



H.S.               {Can we not ratify first &amp; see what legn is really needed.

                    *{Concert with Fr. &amp; U.S. on this policy &amp; Comm. Govts.





	5.	Persia.                                    [Enter  H.M., C.O.S., A.H., P., N.B.			                                               Bowker, Shepherd.

H.M.	Tel. 974 is specially secret.

	Mtg. on Saturday.

		“Pushing around” – as condition or assume it.

	After discn, these points were put to P. by H.:  as proposal of H.M.G.

		H. has recd this (v. secret) reply.  Pleased to note tht. in acc.

		with formula H.M.G. recogn. princ. of natn.  P. expects this

		[will be publicly declared.]  Glad to receive mission.  Which will

		discuss method of execn of the law in so far as it refers to mutual

		interest of the 2 countries.  P. believes no tension in south:  &amp; is

		sure [ ] will enable discns to be conducted spirit friendliness.

	H. told P. he cdn’t pass this on to H.M.G., since not responsive to 

		H.M.G. offer.  M’while, B. offer must be regarded as not made

		because dependent on favourable P. offer re South.

	If we are content with re-phrased P. reply, we can send mission.



P.M.	First P. reply is hopeless.  Doesn’t go any way to meet us re South.

		Bring back the law, as well as principle, of natn.

	V. unsatisf. on both points.



Bowker.	i)	Invitn of P. to U.K. Govt., transmitted thro’ H.

	ii)	Cab. Minute (Persian).  Recorded invitn.  Said U.K. wd. be

			expected publicly to accept principle of natn.  Quoted

			Jackson Mission offer.

	iii)	H. said he wd. advise H.M.G. of invitn;  of Cab. Minute.

	Thus, the “law” referred to is the earlier, general, law. – not to the

		detailed (objectionable) law.



H.M.	Real argument for going on is to chance it, &amp; rely on getting it

		straight in discussion.



H.G.	Talks by officials with Levy.

	L. said he’d had many talks with P., had frightened them, but they

		still are ready to take suicidal steps.  They have agreed:

		i) not to insist on later law  ii) to negotiate on basis of 1st law.



		Read out from official minute of mtg …..

	Thus, any managing Co. can’t be A.I.O.C. only.  Other oil cos. wd. 

		have to come in.  That Co. wd. sell the oil, partly to P., partly to 

		A.I.O.C. for distribn.

	Role of Co. will be smaller than I had thought.  Diffies for us with

		A.I.O.C.

	Nor do P. want U.K. Govt. too closely associated with a new Co.



Fr.Sh.	Believe P. are raisg. their asking price.

	These points are in P. minds.  But we mayn’t have to yield on all.

	A no. of P. wd. accept somethg. much less than this.

	Most members of Govt. wd. accept compromise.  But they are 

		intimidated by extremists.  Opposn to M. is growing:  includes,

		however, extremists, toughs &amp; religious fanatics.

	If we stand firm, we may not have to concede all this.



H.G.	Levy has said we shall.  H. therefore thinks so.  We shall be pressed to

		go thus far.



R.R.S.	Had long talk with L., alone &amp; with H.  He said this was the kind of

		thing:  &amp; most vital point is A.I.O.C. must go.



P.M.	Attitude of Co. staff.  If mission goes w’out any satisfn re south, our

		staff wd. be outraged.



R.R.S.	H. must go back.  We can’t send mission w’out more assurance than

		this.



	Agreed	{  Tell H. we won’t send on this basis.

			{  Wait until H. gets reply to his earlier message.

			{  No need to object to H. sending a further message

			{  if it’s face-saver.



C.N.S.	Message that things are quieter in Abadan.  And Maggi is quiescent.



H.G.	Suggested word “essential” vice “helpful” that tension in 

		south be relieved.



E.Sh.	Is it wise to pitch our demands so high.



E.Sh.	Only point of substance is wtr. settlement is acceptable to B. staff.



P.M.	I favour includg. “essential”.



Fr.Sh.	Tension in South exists &amp; is getting worse.  Incldg. ques. of discipline

		among labour force.  Tension provoked by P.  Irritn on part of B.

		staff is such tht. there may be an incident.  Reluctant to keep

		them much longer unless some assurance tht. tension will soon be

		relieved.



E.Sh.	Wd dispatch of mission relieve it?



Fr.Sh.	P. Govt wd. seek to diminish it.  But B. staff wd. despair if mission

		went out w’out any prior P. assurance re reducg. tension.



N.B.	Negotn frustrated ab initio if B. staff won’t stay in Persia.



			Agreed:   R.R.S. to see H. &amp; suggest some formula 

			                      incldg. “essential”.

	Statement in H/C.



P.M.	Say as little as possible, for we are in middle of negotiations.

	Ask people to refrain fr. comment on P. because Harriman’s visit.

	Can announce tht., if mission goes, it will be R.R.S.



	Financial Questions.	[Exit  Bowker., R.R.S.

	1)	Not heard.                                         }  Disposed to

	2)	P. have now passed legn re sterling. }  p’pone both for 24 hrs.



			Agreed:   P’pone for 24 hrs.

			                L.O.’s to consider first ques.

			                      R.R.S:  Favour paying, in interest of negotns.



				[Exit  N.B., Sol.Genl.





	6.	German Contribution to Western Defence.



H.M.	Cab. accepted principle, about 7 mos. ago, but reserved time &amp;

		method.

	M’while, discns on G. contn and on Eur. Army.

	Need for quick decision – views of Eisenhower &amp; U.S. Govt. – wh.

		wd. be followed by constitn &amp; training of a G. force.

	Opposn in Labour Party – diminishing.  Comm. campaign v. it, too.

	This will come up at N.A.T. in Sept.  We shall be in diffies if we take

		a negative line.  If nothg. done re Germany – R. have more 

		troops in E. Germany:  R. have armed Police in E. Germany:

		W.G. are in mood to help, but if it passes R. might walk in.

		No provn to R. if we did it Eur. Army method.

	No solution by seekg. disarmament in E. &amp; W. Germany.

	My concln:  this is in B. interests.  G. more likely to go wrong way

		if disarmed.  Bad for us if defence line is nearer west.

	Only decn of principle requd at this time.

	Method:  direct contn or by Eur. Army.  Eur. Army wd. be easier for

		French:  less provocative to R:  U.S. disposed to favour it.  But

		no final commitmt yet because details not all known.



P.M.	Views of C.O.S. on ques. of provocation.  Can we risk that at this

		time of weakness.  Saw memo. suggestg. if this done we shd.

	y/	have to mobilize next year.



C.N.S.	We believe R. fear G. re-armament.  But, for next 2 yrs, we believe R.

		won’t want to go to war.  Atom.

                    x/	Risk of not re-arming G. is greater/x 10 Divns. short.  Can’t defend

		G. w’out G. re-armed.

	Details:  rough p’mme made.  Oct. ’52 will be first recruitment of

		rank &amp; file:  divns training by Apl. ’53.

	U.S. have assured us re-armg. of G. will not delay N.A.T. equipment.

	Repeat x/.

P.M.	Do C.O.S. believe y/?



C.N.S.	No.  We have no indicn tht. R. will want to start major war.



H.M.	F.O. view:  G. contn to Eur. Army wd. not increase risk of R. 

		aggression.



H.D.	We are commd in principle to re-arming G. at some stage.  E.B. was

		reluctant.

                   	a)	G. are dangerous.  Different fr. any Europ.  G. have an interest in 

		fighting a war v. R.  We only in defending ourselves.

	Who will join the colours in G.?  They celebrate release of Ramke.

	I don’t trust G. as Allies.  They are not a peace-loving nation.

		And they have reason to fight R., many of them to recover lost

		homes.

	Germans also differ fr. others in that they cd. work with R.

		(paras. 9 &amp; 14.) and join them against us.

                   	b)	Provocn to R.  Risks either way.  Def. Cttee thght. 1954 a danger 		year because atomic stocks.  But C.I.G.S. thght., if G. re-armed, 		it wd. move fwd. to 1952.

	Deplorable weakness of remainder of Europe.  Makes it even more

		risky to add a G. force.  Invites R. to strike before it gets stronger.	My concln.  We can’t go back on principle.  But play it very slow.

	Will there really be arms for all, from U.S.?  In P.M.’s speech:  N.A.T.

		re-armament must precede that of G.  Wrong to give G. arms

		before all other Eur. have all they want.

	Para. 28. 1)-3) wrong because suggest more speed.  I want less.

		On 2):  don’t be rash enough to do this outside Eur. Army.

			   Make that essential.

		On 3):  don’t put any pressure on French.

	Planning wd. be safer.



P.	H.D. hates the Germans:  that influences his judgmt.

	Most of his arguments were v. the principle – wh. we have accepted.

	We can’t defend Eur. w’out Germany.

	Issue is:  do we go on or not.  Can’t dilly &amp; dally.

	Militarily it’s obvious.  G. are best fighters in Europe &amp; in front line.

	They wd. be last to get arms.

	Provocn to R.  They have had a year to think about it &amp; done nil.

		They have armed E. Germany.  They have no logical ground for 

		provocn.



E.Sh.	All the arguments of H.D. are against the principle.  Why don’t they

		advocate reversing our earlier decision.

	If we are going to re-arm G., we must make a start sometime on

		planning &amp; prepn.  Now or in 18 months?  Better do it now.

	Provocn to R.  Cab. have accepted inclusion of Turkey in N.A.T.O.

		on R. borders &amp; her hereditary enemy &amp; with 20 Divns. in being.

		Was not that provocative?  Surely more so.

	N.A.T.O. itself is regarded by R. as provocative (4 Power talks).

	Arms.  Not certain U.S. will be able to supply the arms.  But I agree G.

		shd. not be re-armed at expense of N.A.T. Powers.  I accept that.

	European Army.  Cock-eyed scheme:  but for pol. reasons may be 

		desirable to accept the concept.

	There is a risk.  Best safeguard is N.A.T. strength.



J.S.	I accept the principle.  But this is a challenge to R.  Quote C.I.G.S.

		in mtg. of Comm. Def. Ministers – one factor more than any 

		other wh. mght. provoke R. to action.  Must therefore be careful

		to judge when we make this challenge.  Rash to do this before we

		are ready.  Quite different to risk this 2 yrs’ hence.

	Essence is timing.  “Insanely rash” to do this now.  Believe it will be

		1953 before we are ready to run that risk.  Re-affirm principle:

		say we don’t favour doing it before ’53:  &amp; it will

		then fit in with Eur. Army conceptn.



C.A.S.	May I state views of C.O.S. as a whole?  Read out a) to e) of

		para. 15 of C.O.S. memo. of 23/2/51.  D.O.(51) 17.



J.G.	We accepted G. contn to w. defence – not G. re-armament as such.

	This memo. suggests tht. we shd. join U.S. in pressing French to agree

		to somethg. they don’t want viz., G. raising contns before Eur.

		Army formed.

	Who will join these G. units?  And who command them?

	If we press Fr. on this ques., we may brk. them at hands of Comms.

	Suppose we lose Fr. by re-arming G.

	Only safe way of allowg. G. to re-arm is to make them part of 

		Eur. Army.



McN.	Support H.D.

	i)	This is real fear of R.

	ii)	What is G.’s most effective contribn to Eur. defence?  Merely to

			re-arm G. won’t solve that.  G. is impeding our own

			defence p’mme e.g. on steel scrap.  This wd. draw on genl.

			pool of materials &amp; equipmt.

	iii)	Can’t expect political stability in Europe if we allow G. Army to

			emerge while Fr. etc., are so weak.  No Fr. will believe tht.

			G. forces will come in to Eur. Army “eventually” if allowed

			to start outside it.

	iv)	Announce this in Sept. – at variance with French?  What a time

			to choose?



G.T.	What is our answer to re-arming of E. Germany?



J.S.	Only 60.000 in E. Germany.  I wdn’t mind		[Re-enter  R.R.S.

		that amount of re-armament in W. Germany.



G.W.	Mil. view:  Europe indefensible w’out G.  Must therefore be only

		timing.  Must therefore be safer to do it now, when we have

		atomic superiority.

	Arms:  only those needed for training &amp; not at once.



H.G.	Basic ques:  defence line.  If w. of Elbe, v. serious for us.  Can’t

		do it on Elbe w’out G.

	This proposal is easier for our pol. angle.  Eventually w’in Eur. Army.

		Much turns on discns re Army.  Told they had gone v. well.

		G. contn  w’in Eur. Army much less objectionable – more 

		control over them &amp; silly to have Eur. Army w’out G.

	Econ. consequences.  £130 m. p.a. if G. refuse to pay our occupn

		costs.  Shall have to take a/c of that in def. expre in future.

	Scrap.  In our interests tht. G. shd. use their steel for arms rather than

		exports wh. compete with ours.  Can’t expect them to go on 

		sendg. us scrap &amp; keepg. their steel output low.

	Recommend:  go fwd. reasonably fast on basis of Eur. Army.



P.M.	I wd. prefer to play this slow.

	Get Eur. stronger before you start G.

	They will go v. fast when they are allowed to start.



E.Sh.	Read time-table.



H.M.	Can we go slower than that.



P.M.	Don’t want them to start before its agreed they shd. form part

		of Eur. Army.



H.M.	French can’t have it both ways.  Slow in armg. themselves:  &amp; say

		G. can’t re-arm until they are strong.



E.Sh.	Fr. have accepted principle of G. contn to a Eur. Army.



P.M.	But many ques. out-standg. on E. Army.



H.G.	If this comes up as part of E. Army, many diffies disappear.



A.V.A.	Para. 28(3) is essence.  Mil. view now favours Divn.  Decn wd.

		commit us.

	We have bn. blackmailed by G. (with U.S.) into going too fast with

		liberation of G. w’out assurance of her good faith.



H.M.	They must pay either occupn costs or cost of their own Forces.



J.S.	If we knock out 28(3) we can all agree.



E.Sh.	That won’t work.  Someone must raise forces before we can have 

		Eur. Army.

	Must raise a unit before it’s incorporated in Eur. Army.



H.M.	Time-table complies with P.M.’s point of view.



P.M.	Let Eur. Army be discussed first.



J.	If H.M. can carry Fr. with him, we shall have all our guarantees.



T.W.	Delete “as rapidly as poss.” fr. 28(1).



H.S.	Support H.M.  On C.O.S. view, we can’t defend W. Eur. w’out G. 	help.  Can’t expect too much fr. other Eur. – they have the “palsied

		will”.  G. re-armament mght. urge them on a bit quicker.

	Fear of G. re-armament is v. real in E. Europe.  Will give R. a

		prop. weapon to consolidate their posn there.  But doubt if it wd.

		launch R. on a global war.

	Risk of a re-armed G. allying herself with R. is less than Yugoslavia

		or even France.



G.W.	If we delete 28(3), Fr. can block us for ever on Eur. Army.



H.G.	Leave 28(3):  but let H.M. try to get this into E. Army fr. outset.



P.M.	Give H.M. discretion, in light of views expressed.





	5.	Persia (contd).



R.R.S.	Formula went on Sat. p.m. – Harriman tells me.

	No more now contemplated.

	Gifford formula wd. succeed:  I said we wdn’t support that.



H.M.	That was sending out on assumptn they wd. relieve tension.



P.M.	Not prepd to accept that.



R.R.S.	Harriman returns this p.m.
