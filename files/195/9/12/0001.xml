C.M. 34 (51)					7th May, 1951



1.	     Parliament.



C.E.	Party diffies last Wed. may recur on 2 occasions this week.

	Tho’ 50 abstained &amp; 5 voted against – some 15 of the 50 were those who go home by last ‘bus.  But 35 is a serious no. of abstainers.  Hope we may evade trouble to-day.  But on Pensions, our challenge is fr. a more solid section of Party.  O.A.P.’s are beginning to ask what Govt. have done for them;  &amp; Bill does nothg. to appease 65/70 group of these.



W.W.	Main danger is on Pension Bill.



T.W.	Conserv. amendmt for earlier date has stolen our thunder.



H.G.	Part of trouble is tht. M/N.I. hasn’t bn. able to announce tht. assistce rate will be corresp. raised.  That will give relief to 65/70 group with no other income.

                x|		But mistake to give way on 65/70.  We agreed we wd. try to get across the new principle of later retiring age.

	Wait until we see how we get on with T.U. group.

	Trouble mainly from miners, for whom it is diff. to go on after 65.

	Resist suggn tht. there’s somethg. degrading about supplementary assistance.



H.M.    	x/, due to constitutional posn of Bd., is awkward.  Can’t we square it with Bd. before Cttee stage.  And say it was always our intentn.



J.G.	Get Bd. to say before Wed. tht. they will submit proposals.



			Generally agreed.



E.Sh.	Date?



H.G.	Earliest is 1/9, administratively.  I’ve told M/N.I. I’m willing to accept a somewhat earlier date, i.e. 1/8.  But she can’t make that date.



E.Sh.	Much apprehension in Party at delay – what are o.a.p’s to do m’while.



J.G.	In 1946 much pressure to go up to new rate v. quickly.  We took adminve risks – with result tht. several 100.000 didn’t get the new rates, and rows in H/C.  If date is now to be brght fwd., we must say we can’t guarantee there won’t be any ships.



H.M.	Stand firmer on this than the other.  Wd. appear to be running away.



H.D.	On other hand, more serious politically because Tories will line up with our dissidents.



		Agreed:  Discuss with M/N.I. &amp; bring up to Cab. again if need be.





	National Health Service Bill.



H.McN.	M/H. has tables amendmt of Cl. 1. requiring re committal.

	Improvement – but not from angle of dissidents.  May it not provoke renewed trouble?



			Agreed:  C.E., H.G. &amp; Health Ministers to consider before 	this p.m.

					           [Exit W.W.





2.	     Exports to China.



J.G.	I do not intend to make a statement to-day – tho’ Press suggest it.  Intended to do it to-morrow, to cover H. Kong &amp; Singapore.



P.M.	Shd. be a single statement.  Cover Col. posn in B/T. statement today.



H.S.	Open genl. licence fr. here to H Kong;  &amp; controls fr. there to China are imposed there.  Less effective.

	Rubber exports have leapt up.  In 1st 6 days Apl., before export control, v. large shipmts.  We are open to serious criticism – pouring rubber into China.



J.G.	Colonies follow U.K. policy;  &amp; U.K. has imposed no embargo on rubber.

		As fr. 6/4 exports confined to estimate of normal peace-time needs.



P.M.	Why did it run on so long.  No U.K. embargo because no rubber produced here.



H.S.	Same applies, however, to steel &amp; chemicals:  exports fr. H. Kong.



E.Sh.	This came to Cab. at my instance, twice.  I proposed 2d, further restns but Cab. said we shd. not close down on this trade with China.

	My note to P.M. last week explained rubber position.

	We are proof r. criticism on most items, but not on rubber.



H.S.	Short of open discriminn r. China, we can’t put ourselves beyond criticism.



E.Sh.	B/T., with Cab. support, were against complete prohibition.



H.S.	I don’t share that view.  I wd. prohibit all exports of rubber, and [sic]

H.M.	U.S. are pressg. us to go further on Coll. Measures Cttee.  Have said we won’t accept their pol. proposals, but ready to look at extensions of economic.

	B/T. in diffies so long as we act covertly.  China knows what we are doing - &amp; U.S. public opinion doesn’t.  Can’t defend rubber posn.  Come clean on that &amp; be ready for overt action on other commodies.  In principle accept need to discuss now on Col. Measures Cttee.



H.S.	I wd. prefer comprehensive statemt.  I cdn’t cover H. Kong to-day.

		Shd. I p’pone until Tuesday &amp; cover the whole thing.



P.M.	I have a P.Q. to-day.  Shall I promise B/T. statement to-morrow?



H.S.	Can I say we will prob. export/rubber altogether &amp; control other strat.

                   x|		supplies thro’ H. Kong by combinn of U.K./H. Kong controls.  And statutory, not adminve.



J.G.	Make it clear we are consultg. Govts. concerned with a view to fixing this.  Remember:  this is economic sanctions.  All T.U.’s in H. Kong are controlled by Communists.



P.M.	H’to we have not adopted econ. sanctions.  That is now being discussed in U.N.



G.W.	Don’t endorse H.S. proposal w’out thght re Malaya as well as H. Kong.

		Embargo on all rubber is v. near econ-sanctions.

	If we do this sort of thing, we must review whole policy re H. Kong.



H.G.	Also:  is it doing any good.  They can get rubber elsewhere – incldg. fr. R. unless we embargo r. whole R. block., &amp; to do that wd. have grave econ. consequences.

	We must think where we are going before adopting x/.



J.	Our policy was to give Good Offices Cttee a run first.  They have failed.

		We have now to discuss further measures – but in U.N. [sic]



H.D.	Yes: only with others.



H.S.	I can’t justify supplying useful goods to a China wh. is fighting r. us.



H.McN.	B/T is under pol. criticism.  We must say we’ve done all we cd. reasonably do unilaterally.  But we are now going to discuss in U.N. what further measures ought now to be taken.  Viz., economic sanctions only in pursuance of U.N. decision.



H.G.	Ceylon are askg. our views on barter of rubber for rice fr. China.



G.W.	And we may not be able to restrain them.



H.S.	Shall I then give only the facts &amp; say we are considering, in view of failure of G. Offices Cttee, what further measures can now be taken – considerg. it among ourselves in consultn with Govrs. of Singapore &amp; H. Kong.  Indeed since end/Mar. control has bn. applied to all tyres &amp; licensg. control applied to various types of steel &amp; non-ferrous.



			Agreed:  one statement to-day, by B/T, covering H. Kong 	as well.  P.M. to answer his P.Q. by saying merely

			tht. full statement wd. be made after Ques.



H.M.	I want to tell Jebb not to delay discn on econ-sanctions in U.N.  And to tell Acheson what underlies our policy.



H.McN.	Selective embargo.  Make it clear we won’t agree to political gestures.  Embargoes tht. will be practically effective.



H.M.	That is understood.





3.	     Formosa.



H.M.	W’ton. Tel. 1400.

	My judgement:  can’t go back on Cairo decn in favour of cession to China.  But is there any hurry?

	Disadvantage if Formosa were in enemy hands in a major war.

	In view of Korea, best line is to stall.

	Draft Parly statement needs revision.

	“We are in the soup:  are we to come clean” (!).



P.M.	No difficulty.  Cairo covered Formosa &amp; Korea.  Must stick to both parts.  Can’t hand over F. at once.  Ch. have regarded it as danger to them.  To hand it to Peking wd. make it a danger to U.S.

	Obvious line is to neutralise it for a period.



T.W.	Make it clear U.S. was a party to Cairo.



J.               x/	Peking has repudiated Cairo qua Korea.  She can’t have it qua F.

	Add to statement need to consult wishes of people of F.



H.McN.	Don’t make a statement.  Our policy is known, as declared by C.R.A. to Truman.  Don’t involve ourselves in U.S. domestic affairs.



H.M.	What of advice of H.M. Ambassador.



A.	Wise advice.  Form needs considn.



A.V.A.	Timing?  Marshall’s evidence.

H.M.	Soon as possible.  Marshall knows our policy.



H.McN.	This is a Rep/Dem. battle.  By this statement we shd. be takg. sides.

		H.M. Amb. is influenced by local climate.



E.Sh.	Favour a statement.



H.G.	So do I.  To avoid prejudging Anglo/U.S. relations.

	Surely it’s for Amb. to advise.

	Bring in x/:  a good point.



A.V.A.	Debating point.  U.S. Rep. answer will be:  why don’t we repudiate it too.

	Favour delaying such a statement.



R.R.S.	This statement won’t involve us in U.S. domestic politics.

	Don’t use x/. It’s very controversial.



P.M.	Use my statement on return from W’ton.



H.D.	x/ in draft is v. unwise.  Admits possibility of recognising Ch. K. Shek. as Chinese Govt.



			Agreed:  Statement shd. be made.

			               P.M. and H.M. to consider its terms.





4.	     Closer Association in Central Africa.



P.M.	Is it necessary to this at once?



G.W.	J.G. is going away for 3 wks.  Gt. pressure for publn – esp. in S. Rhodesia as Huggins is holding, for this, embarrassing rept. on Dom. status.

	Only point of importance is x/ in Annex III.  Reason for this is to forestall immediate rejection of report.



P.M.	Diff. to give even qualified assent to this plan.

	Top-heavy. 2 local Govts &amp; a federal Govt.  Where will they get the men to run them.  In territories where only a handful of Europeans.



J.G.	Not askg. for decision – only publn.

	When it is publd, create atmosphere in wh. it won’t be rejected out of hand.  Hence Annex III.  Encouraging, but non-committal.

		Africans are v. closer association.

	We also want to announce tht. we will go out (G.W. &amp; I) to discuss it when they have had a chance to consider it.

	Real point:  danger tht. S. Rhodesia. w’out somethg. like this, will be drawn into union with S. Africa.

P.M.	Plan will be judged on merits.  And if rejected this will make us look foolish.



E.Sh.	No chance to study Rpt.  May be  a defence aspect.  Impact on Union Govt. may have defence aspect.  Want more time.  Other interested Dpts. shd. be consulted.  Even before publication,



G.W.		i) Huggins is pressing us to say it will be published.

		    Will have to be publd.

    Will take 3/4 wks before it can be publd.

    Hope we will at least say it’s going to be publd.

		ii) Let’s say somethg. encouraging about it.  S. Rhodesia, if they

    can’t go north, must go south to the Union.



P.M.	On ii) it won’t be effective.  No one will care.



			Agreed: (1) Say it will be published, in about a month’s 	                   time.

			              (2) Consider merits, &amp; form of statement, later:

	                    possibly in absence of Col. Secretary.





5.	     Stone of Scone.

				            [Enter L.O’s.



H.McN.	Might H.M. the King do this on occasion of his visit north next month.



P.M.	This wd. in effect concede what escapade wanted.



H.McN.	Scottish opinion has bn. focussed, by wrong act, on a real need.

		Remarkable tht. Ch/Scotland shd. put it on Assembly Agenda.



J.	Para. 1 (b).  I shd. have said “except on advice of Ministers”

	Action now wd. be represented as victory for the hooligans.

	Postpone decision for 12 months.



G.W.	We have handed over documents etc.

	Govts. reluctant to do right thing for fear of being thgt. to give way to pressure.

	Support McN.



R.R.S.	No repns to me.



J.G.	Strong nationalist feeling in Scotland as in Wales.



P.M.	To do this at once is to encourage violence.

		Do nothing for a year.



H.D.	With bias in favour of handing it over then.



H.McN.	Cd. we say:  we are prepared to consider, but we won’t consider in light of threats &amp; violence.

	Sc. Nationalist Movemt. has had a great spur from this – much larger mtgs. than ever before.



			Agreed: McN. to submit draft statement to P.M.



C.E.	Hope no statement will be made.

	J.’s correction of his memo. is important &amp; should be noted.  Recommend first:  parlt. can only discuss after recommn made &amp; action taken.

				              [Exit L.O.’s
