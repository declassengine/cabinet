C.M. 43(51).				14th June, 1951.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  W.W.



C.E.	Business for next week.

	Leasehold is urgent, because 24/6 is date in Bill.  If that can’t be

		got, we may have to sit late again on Financial Bill.



R.R.S.	Materials Bill.  Draft passage for W. Paper.  Must be cleared by

		5 p.m. to-day if H/C. are not to think they’re being rushed.



H.G.	Exact posn of R. Cotton Commn:  must be consultn with Lacey.



H.S.	Have sent formula to R.R.S.



H.G.	If we can agree, P.M. need not be consulted again.	   Agreed.





H.G.	Finance Bill.  Importance of making no concession on Speedways.

		This is organised opposn.  Labour support for it not of the best.



C.E.	I have no complaint of them.



H.G.	They are prone to sectional pressures of this kind.



T.W.	Hope H.G. will make a sympathetic statement, incldg. racecourses.

		If he does, prob. no division.



H.M.	Our supporters shd. not commit themselves to these interests.

		I have more sympathy with cinemas.



H.G.	We are doing something for them otherwise.



P.M.	Sympathetic statement:  promise enquiry:  but stand firm.     }

		No abstaining.  Ch. Whip to warn them.                        } Agreed.



H.S.	Cd R. Price M.  W. Paper come out before Dental Goods Order is 	taken.

	Won’t get it by Wed. for certain.  Cd. Order be Thurs. vice Wed.



P.M.	See what can be done.





	2.	Death of Mr Chifley.



P.M.	Regret. – good friend

	Message sent.  No formal reference in H/C.

	Ld. Alexander to represent P.M. at funeral.

	

 

	3.	Japanese Peace Treaty.	[Exit  W.W.

				[Enter  K.Y.

K.Y.	Have got what we want on Congo Basin.

	Minor ques. settled or in fair way to be settled.

	Ship-bldg. expressly reserved.  We can re-open Treaty ques. if D.’s 

		repve doesn’t get satisfn in Tokyo.

	Gold.  Got nowhere on our first claim.  Then put our 2nd suggn of

		U.S. taking it on trust, even if they then gave it back.  This,

		however, he thght. imposs. politically for him – for Congress wd.

		have to vote money to start J. off if she hadn’t got this.  He

		promised, however, to set out U.S. argument in a memo. wh. we

		cd. use to persuade our public – shd. ease our diffies.

	Hope this won’t be regarded as a breaking-point.



H.M.	I agree.  They have a case.  Diff. to ask Congress to vote the money

		required.  We have got some concession on assets in neutral

		countries.

		Ques:  shd. any money be shared betwn. civilian and military.



H.G.	Don’t think U.S. case is strong.  It ignores damage done in war –

		note only on their expre since war.  But don’t think we can make

		it brkg. point.  It’s political, not financial, point;  and H.M. can

		weigh the diffies.  I won’t stand in his way.  Can we indicate tht. 		we don’t like this – part of the give &amp; take.



J.	Omit last sentence of 1st para. of draft.



H.M.	I will consider.



H.D.	The Russians?



K.Y.	We shall continue to consult the Russians.



G.W.	Reverse order of 4th para.      Consider this point.

					[Exit  K.Y.



	4.	Four Power Talks.



H.M.	Proposed we now offer to meet without agenda.



P.M.	i)  We said at outset we would not do so.  ii)  Wd give R. propaganda

		opening they want.



H.D.	P’pone until Oct.  Don’t give impn we don’t want a mtg.



H.S.	Make it clear that all 4 Powers agreed at outset tht. there must be 

		agenda agreed in advance.



H.M.	Influenced by Fr. Elections.  Must help them.

 

McN.	We mustn’t make ourselves look foolish.



H.G.	This wd. be a victory for the Russians.



P.M.	Hansard 13th Nov.  Began with Prague communiqué.  We said we 

		wdn’t meet on that basis.  If we now go in w’out an agenda, 

		we concede that earlier position.



H.M.	Washington re-action.  Tel. fr. Steel.  U.S. officials doubt if this note

		will influence Fr. elections:  but will put it to Acheson.



R.R.S.	Why didn’t we make constructive reply to R.?



H.M.	Because Fr. &amp; U.S. wdn’t agree.



P.M.	C.F.M., if it meets on this basis, will either i) wrangle over agenda or

		ii) have wide-ranging discn wh. admits Prague communiqué.



G.W.	Public want a meeting.



P.M.	To go to a C.F.M. w’out an agenda wd. stultify our position for past

		months.

	Better to accept agenda with non-agreed items.



H.M.	Meet on an implied agenda:  “causes of tension, consequences of it,

		and remedies”. – offer to meet for “ ”.



T.W.	Regret no complete &amp; detailed agenda:  but agreemt. on many items:

		meet and discuss those &amp; others wh. may be raised.



H.M.	That wd. let in N.A.T.



McN.	Are we going to adhere for ever to view tht. N.A.T. shall not go on?

		If so, we can’t agree with Fr. on a note before Elections.  Can’t

		therefore do any more.



H.M.	Don’t want to depart fr. para. 2 of Fr. note.



J.G.	Breakdown w’out Ministers meeting wd. shock public opinion.



P.M.	Amend para. 3.  Say:  recognise Deputies can’t reach full agreemt.

		on agenda:  propose that Ministers shd. try to complete that job,

		working on basis of what Deputies have agreed.



			Agreed:  Try the formula last proposed by P.M.

			               Seek to persuade U.S. to agree to this.  Don’t

			                     press them to a breach.







					[Enter  H.A.M.

	5.	Equal Pay.



H.G.	If we are ever to implement this principle, I’m attracted by Ty. plan.

		Slow, &amp; inexpensive to start with.  But repercussions on 

		industry etc., wh. wd. force C. Service to press for acceleration.

	Hence alternatives in memo.  I much prefer the second – more 

		practical M/L. thinks tht. is too small a concession:  makes 

		further suggn in para. 20.  But we can’t afford £5 m. p.a.:  can’t 

		accept that.

	Choice is betwn. refusing again to do anything or gesture in 17(b),

		explaing. tht. we can’t afford to implement the principle at

		present but do this as gesture of good faith.

	Diffy of refusal:  can’t refer to repercussions in industry.  Sharp

		T.U. re-action to our use of this argument on 2nd wk. hol. with

		pay.  Diff. therefore to refusal proposal involvg. only

		£300.000 p.a.



A.R.	First ques:  can we do nothing.

	If, politically, we must do something it must be a gesture not affectg.

		industry.  I wd. prefer para. 20.  The initial cost is high, but

		mght. not rise.  Means equal pay up to 23, 26 in 2 lowest grades:

		and must get married by then.  We shall phase majority by that

		means.  Don’t favour increasing rates at maximum age.



P.M.	This increases the pay of those who need it least:  you give it to the

		 young who are going to marry &amp; give nothing to career women

		who don’t marry.



H.G.	I sympathise with that view.



H.M.	Politically, more dangerous to muck about with this ineffectively

		than stand par.  The enthusiasts for this won’t be satisfied by

		our gesture.

	Don’t believe equal pay is a political winner.

	Good case for doing nothing in present econ. circs.  Easier to handle

		that than a gesture wh. will please nobody.



C.E.	Support H.M. – tho’ I’m more in favour of ultimate equal pay.

	This will involve immediate revision of family allowances.

	Support P.M.’s point also.  Concession to young girls wd. increase

		the force of the agitation.

	Wait until we can do somethg. much bigger than this.

	M’while Ty. shd. consider what a big concession will mean in terms of

		family allowances.



E.Sh.	Armed Forces.  We shd. have to follow suit.  £250.000 p.a.



H.A.M.	We shd. have to follow suit in N.H. Services.  I wd. be content to do

		nothing.

T.W.	Agree with C.E.  Wd. like all consequences examined before big step

		is taken.



J.G.	Cd. we say tht., when econ. circs. are more favourable, we shd.

		favour the gradual approach?



H.G.	I don’t like it:  but we are committed to the principle.  When will the

		time be ripe?  If we are to reject, I’d like to explain all the

		consequences.

	Then we shall be thought to be going back on the principle.



H.M.	Party never understood the implications.



H.G.	Pay becoming more ‘equal’ everywhere, save in C. Service.  That

		was ground for ????? gesture.



A.R.	Don’t like equal pay on basis of service because of its repercussions

		in industry where it wd. not be understood.



H.G.	Doubt if it wd. be followed in industry.

	If we resist, we are in danger of being represented as never having

		believed in the principle.



H.S.	Favour doing nothing now.  Equal pay, when it comes, must involve

		drastic revision of fam. allowances.  And I wd. say so.



			Agreed:   {  Make no concession at present.

			                {  Put the whole case against.





	6.	Vocational Training.



		Approved.
