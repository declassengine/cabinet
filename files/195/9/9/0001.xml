C.M. 31 (51)					24th April, 1951



1.	   Parliament.

		                                                                   [Enter W.W. &amp; H.A.M.

C.E.	Business for next week.

	1/5.  Raw Materials.  Early Govt. spokesman:  B/T or M/Supply.



E.Sh.	Reserve Forces.  No. of legal ques.  L.O.’s shd. be on hand.





2.	   N. Health Service Bill.



H.A.M.	Forestalling has already reduced income from charges.

		Appln for dentures doubled &amp; specs. up by 25%.  A.B. said at Party mtg. we shdn’t get this money, and he may have this point in mind.  It wd. suit him to prolong discn.  Tory amendmts 

		i) To put N.A.Bd. out &amp; pass hardship tests on to N.H. Service.

		ii) To make the charges maximum charges.

	These will appeal to our supporters.  Some pressure to urge them not to fall into this Tory trap.



H.M.	On the date, I take the responsibility.  We were still trying to square A.B. 

	Some hope then of getting an agreement.  Hence I told H.G. not to mention a date.  But now we must push Bill through as quickly as we can.



W.W.	Our people wd. like to have N. Insurance Bill early – don’t want N. H. Bill earlier and holding that back.



H.G.	We must get Bill thro’ before Whitsun.  We shall be exposed to ridicule if we lose most of the money.



A.	We get Bill on 7/5; and you want it passed by 10/5.  Pretty hard.

		I’ll do my best.



			Agree.  Must get Bill passed before Whitsun.



H.M.	Amendment (i) is nonsense.  The executive Councils are not equipped for this work &amp; N.A.Bd. are.



J.G.	Legal aid:  we made similar use of N.A.Bd. – extendg. their function to people in work.  Base our arguments on that.



E.Sh.	Tactics.  How will our supporters react?  Believe they will prefer N.A.Bd.



H.M.	J.G. might be ready to intervene in debate, pace Summerskill.



E.Sh.	Amendment (ii) says that you can only vary charges downwards.

		Our people will favour that one.  We must at least say we don’t intend to increase the charges.



T.W.	V. delicate point.  Our formula on “permanence” was designed originally to square A.B.  It will get us into trouble if we go any further.



H.D.	Support E.Sh.  This is minor in reln to Bill as a whole.  Surprised tht. Bill provides for upward revision by O-in-C.  Had thght that would need fresh legn.  Dangerous to give that power to a future (Tory) Govt.  Discipline on this Bill will be diff.  I wd. concede this – tho’ to a Labour mover vice Tory one.



H.G.	Appreciate force of this.  But want time to consider &amp; consult H.McN.  Also, if we concede this, we must get the rest in return w’out further whittling away.



			Agreed:  resist amendment (i)

			               H.G. to consider (ii) with Ministers concerned &amp; 

			               bring back to Cab. if he can’t agree to meet it.



			                                                            [Exit W.W. &amp; H.A.M.



3.	   Four-Power Meeting.



H.M.	U.S. are stiffening v. Moscow because MacArthur trouble.  They also think we are tending to appease.

	Par. 12.  Davis in 3 Power mtg. favoured concessions on all minor points.  U.S. attitude – as in brief.  Davies assured U.S. we wd. stand firm on level precedg. redn in armaments item:  &amp; wdn’t press for further change (Tel. to Paris 34) on wording of resolution.

	Risk of a break due to R. walking out.   If that happened, we shd. be clearly shown on the drafts to have bn. reasonable.  I wd therefore have preferred  a clear draft with all our proposed concessions.  Diffy: language on disarmament might appear to commit us before Ministerial talks begin.  Mght. have safeguarded that by exchange letters makg. it clear this is only Agenda, doesn’t prejudge discussion. Wd. still prefer clear copy.

                       x|	But U.S. &amp; Fr. fear that wd. only invite further R. pressure for other concessions.



H.D.	On x/. have we tried that on the others?

	If we cd. get that, it wd. make it much easier.

	This wrangle seems to public v. unreal, fuss over v. little.



A.	Our publicity on that point cd. be improved.



E.Sh.	Must resist R. suggn for havg. N.A.T.O. on Agenda.  We have a good case there.  But on (b) – disarmament - we aren’t so strongly based.  Logical to begin with “level”:  but public won’t appreciate this distinction.

	I wdn’t mind agreeing to having demilitn of G. put rather higher.

	But what are R. at?  Do they mean business?



H.M.	We think they did at outset.  Doubt if they do now.



J.	Two dangers

i)	We may quarrel among the 3.  That wd. be disaster if it became public.  And no agreemt. with R.

ii)	In diffce betwn. us and U.S., French will side with U.S.  Avoid that position.



J.G.	Climax may be coming. If this breaks, public will be v. anxious.

		Was suggd before tht. these prelimies shd. be by officials.  We ought to be able to show it wasn’t our fault.  Shd. Ministers intervene before there is a smash.



T.W.	Publicity shd. have bn. better.



H.S.	Is there anythg. in R. text on disarmament wh. excludes level.

		If not, surely unwise to allow confce to break down.



G.W.	We shall get wrong with our public opinion – by denying discn of N.A.T.O. &amp; quibbling over “level”.



H.S.	Can’t demonstrate tht. R. text is bogus.



H.M.	I can’t press this to point of alienating U.S.



E.Sh.	I agree with H.M. – but fear adverse reaction fr. U.K. opinion.

		Suspn tht. U.S. don’t want a settlement.



H.S.	Is it better to break at a prelim. mtg. on Agenda or at a mtg. at wh. merits were discussed.



J.G.	Strange’s Mission to Moscow.  Why leave peace &amp; war to an official?



G.W.	Split Agenda, if adopted, shd. be suggd before breakdown of talks.





4.	Economic Affairs.

			                                               [Enter R.R.S., N.B., B. &amp; G.S.

	Man Power



E.Sh.	Under-emplt. allegn.  Is it true?



H.G.	Some known short-time workg.  Some belief  tht. firms are hanging on to labour for fear of losing it.  Some short-time because steel sheet shortage.  Nothg. firm yet.

·	Will try to gauge it more accurately in next rpt.



	Production



H.G.	Not v. re-assuring on 4% assumptn.

	Coal is no longer black.  We must try, however, to raise exports again.

	Steel one of most serious risks.



G.S.	Coming to E.P.C. this a.m.



H.G.	Shipping:  can’t make up short-fall before end/year, it is thought.



B.	Two Dpts. are in close touch on this.



A.V.A.	Dom. Colln of scrap?



G.S.	Pretty well organised.  In 1947 they got 1/2 m. t.:  can’t expect to get the same again.



A.B.	Why then cover up disused train lines.



B.	Won’t pay cost of lifting it.  Are now discussing this with M/S.



E.Sh.	Alleged w.o. have masses.



H.M.            {	Home Informn P.R.O.’s shd. consider publicity.

                    {	L.A.’s shd. be hotted up.



T.W.	There is an organn.  And Sub Cttee of Prod Cttee is considg. it.



G.W.	Can we have figures of industry’s own stocks.  Last year they ran down w’out our knowledge.



N.B.	Coal. Internal consumption is increasing v. rapidly – mainly for industry.  Man-powers and investment must be pressed.



H.G.	Sulphur allocation – mght. have bn. worse.



	Internal Financial Situation



H.G.	Budget was barely enough.  We are at risk.



A.B.	Two corrections – apparently on para. 39.



H.S.	Import prices – increased mean heavier export effort.



	Foreign Trade



H.G.	Exports are not rising as hoped.  May be influenced by shipping.  but need for intense drive now.

	G. &amp; d. reserves won’t continue to increase – Surplus/Eur. deficit with U.S. and R.S.A.  In R.S.A. it’s Col. vice Doms.
