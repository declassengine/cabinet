C.M. 38 (51)					29th May, 1951



1.	     Parliament.



C.E.	Every Minister shd. attend for division on Motion calling for amendmt. of Govt. of Ireland Act.  Must not be carried.



H.M.	Get mover to drop it, in view of King’s visit and bomb incident.





2.	     Japanese Peace Treaty.



P.M.	Doubts y’day re Articles 6 and 7.



H.M.	My supplementary memo. shows earlier Cab. decn – on basis of which we have talked to U.S. &amp; Comm. Govts.

	But I see Parly diffies.  Cd. we persuade Dulles to omit Art. 6 &amp; 7 – wd. avoid drawg. attention to this stressing J’s right to re-arm.  Wd. make no legal diffies.



H.D.	I wd. support that line.

	For on 2nd thoughts I feel tht. Art 6 wd. make diffies.



P.M.	Earlier decn relied on contd presence of occupn troops.  This draft provides for their w’drawal.



A.V.A.	Tho’ J. has seen the draft Treaty.



E.Sh.	Also no precedent for peace treaty with no provn for restrictg. re-armament. That may be an awkward point.



J.	The old treaties contained no such provisions.



C.I.G.S.	Adhere to our views.  J. shd. have considerable latitude to re-arm, but shd. have a voluntary restrictive agreement limiting certain types of armament.



A.R.	Why not have the restrictions in the Treaty.



G.W.	If permanent, will eventually become unenforceable - &amp; whole Treaty is brought into disrepute.

	Tel. from Menzies.  Earlier views fr. Austr. were by offls.  M. now says no revival of J. mil. power &amp; even if overborne on that no naval power.



P.M.	He also has points on trade &amp; gold.

	(U.S. tendency to treat J. as blue-eyed boy)



G.W.	Canada is now stronger r. gold provisions also.  On that we might be tougher.

J.G.	This reflects public opinion in Austr. as shown in Election.



McN.	Believe Doms. shd. be consulted earlier than 13 (c) stage.  Believe we promised them earlier consultn.  We ought to give them a real chance to comment effectively.



E.Sh.	Art. 6 &amp; 7 based on Charter.  A defence agreemt. – wd. it have validity apart fr. Treaty:  wd. it be based on Charter.  Better to include defence agreemt. in Treaty?



J.	Wdn’t make it enforceable.



H.S.	Equal validity wtr. in Treaty or not.

	Nor wd. it be consistent with Art. 6.



H.D.	Art. 6 (b) is inconsistent with M.’s view.  Delete 6 (b):  &amp; discuss defence limitations separately.



H.M.	Other Doms. will adopt a diff. attitude.

	U.S. might conclude unilateral treaty.

	Principle of J. re-armament.  Short-term risk is tht. J. might become victim of R. aggression.  They shd. be able to resist it – unless we are to take on defence of all our defeated enemies.



P.M.	There is also China:  who may say J. is being used by Fascist capitalist Powers r. China.

	Same risk with G.  But there we have integrated G. in internl scheme.

		J. looks more like armed U.S. satellite.



H.S.	Allied Powers recognise J. possesses right of self-defence &amp; may have forces w’in followg. limits wh. shall not be exceeded w’out permn.



G.W.	India wd. decline to accept that.



H.G.	Matter of presentation.  If it is in fact intended tht. J. shall not have ships larger than frigates, bombers etc., why can’t we write those limitations into Treaty.



E.Sh.	I would prefer that.

	Unless there is some limited J. re-armament, U.S. occupn is likely to continue.  That wd. not be desirable.  Better to bring J. back into comity of nations, with some measure of re-armament.



P.M.	The only ques. is wtr. limited re-armament shd. be recognised in Treaty.

		We are all agreed tht. there shd. be limited J. re-armament.



H.M.	I will try 

a)	to introduce limitations into Treaty itself.

b)	to get defence pact between U.S. &amp; J.

	But Dulles may be awkward because we agreed earlier.



J.	Get from J. an undertaking that they will do this and that, and construct Treaty on basis of recognising that undertaking.



	Administration of Japanese Islands.



McN.	Don’t like it.



G.W.	Doms. won’t like it either.



McN.	Earlier plan was preferable.  This will look like tricking Trusteeship Council.



G.W.	R. can veto this - &amp; wd. get some support.



C.E.	But we want to be sure these Islands are not in J. hands.



P.M.	Press Dulles to come clean &amp; make J. renounce sovereignty. We have to be brave re H. Kong.  Let U.S. be brave about there.



			Agreed:  disagree with U.S.





	Japanese Gold.



H.G.	Our repve didn’t press his point sufficiently hard.

	W. Germany has bn. stripped of her gold &amp; paid heavy reparations.

	This wd. treat J. much more favourably than G.

	In H/C. debate we said we wd. try to get somethg. for compensation.

	True tht. G. was looted gold and J. her own:  but other countries have had to use gold to protect their posn.

	True tht. U.S. claim it all.  But on principle it shd. be taken for repn even if U.S. decided unilaterally to give it back.





	Japanese Ship-building.



McN.	Repeated earlier argument in favour of restn.



C.I.G.S.	We acquiesced in seeking voluntary limitn.



H.M.	Cdn’t enforce restns.

				     [Exeunt C.O.S.



	Japanese Gold.



H.M.	Our repns didn’t give way in W’ton.

	Suggest H.G. shd. argue this with Dulles himself.

	Think U.S. line will be – we shall get the gold in that event.



P.M.	Bring this back to Cabinet before final decision.



G.W.	Some Dom. H. Commrs. might attack Dulles in Ldn.

	Para. 10 (c).  F.O. proposal approved.

	Para 10 (d)  



H.S.	i) Two outstandg. ques.  J. rights under Berlin &amp; St. Germain Treaties shd. be abrogated.  If they aren’t, Lancs. cotton will be knocked out of Congo Basin.  We don’t want to give J. m.f.u. treatment there.

	ii) Allied property in Japan.  Draft envisages dom. legn in J.  But can’t accept that unless we had seen &amp; approved it in advance.



A.V.A.	On i) we must be able to supply.  We haven’t always bn. able to do so.



J.G.	Agree.  J. cheap textiles have bn. basic to these Colonies.



H.S.	Can meet those points w’out giving J. m.f.u. rights.

		This ques. shd. come back to Cabinet after talks with Dulles.





	Procedure.



H.M.	a) strong case for circulatg. joint U.S./U.K. draft. Will report to Cabinet again.

	b) Consultn with Doms. – as before.

	c) Inform French &amp; Dutch Govts.  Wait until we see results of Dulles’ talks.



G.W.	b) If there are diffces of view, they shd. be aired at para. 13 (c) stage.  They might be brought into those discns.

d)	Participation of China.



H.M.	Favour Canadians plan – leaving out both Ch. “Govts”.



G.W.	India may suggest we show draft Treaty to Peking.  Mght. we suggest tht. India shd. do it themselves, if U.S. agree.



			Agreed:  leave this last point to H.M.’s discretion.



McN.	If Canadian plan is followed, diff. to hold final discns in W’ton where there is F/E. Commn on wh. Chiang K Sh. is repd.



e)	Formosa.  Approved.









	Japanese Ship-building.



McN.	As we are now proposing to write mil. limitations into Treaty, shd. we not do ditto re ship-building – speed &amp; tonnage limits.



A.V.A.	How do that when we have failed to get it for Germany.



H.M.	For security – or to protect our own industry?



A.V.A.	A reasonably healthy U.K. ship-building industry is a security need.



E.Sh.	Can’t restrict, to protect Br. industry.

	J., if not allowed to build ships, will compete with us elsewhere, e.g. by increased textile production.



C.E.	Supported argument of A.V.A.



P.M.	Can’t do better then para. 5. – re-informed by materials shortages etc., in coming years.

	H.M. shd. keep generally in touch during talks with Dulles.





3.	     Road Haulage Strike.



A.R.	Rd. Haulage Exec. took over patrol staff of 5.  Have now decided to increase this to 11.  Union informed but not consulted.

	The men regarded this as Gestapo &amp; struck at midnight Sunday.

		London &amp; Home Counties:  90% came out.  All lorries coming up to Ldn. are taken over by “pilots”:  so it will all come to a stop.

	Not a dispute with Union.  Unofficial.  Have asked Union to take initiative – e.g. asking Executive to p’pone introducing patrols for 2 months for discns.  Union are reluctant to do this.

	If we can’t stop this, we can’t clear docks.  And if we use mil. labour docks will come out too.

	Another example of strikes occurring thro’ stupidity.  These patrols cd. have bn. increased quietly by ones &amp; twos, w’out saying anything about it.



P.M.	Send for Deakin &amp; press him to apply for this adjournment.





4.	Parliament:  House of Lords Chamber.



C.E.	Speaker, for procedural reasons, will not refer to this.
