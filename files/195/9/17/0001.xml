C.M. 39 (51)					31st May, 1951



1.	     Parliament.

					         [Enter W.W.

C.E.	Business for next week.

					         [Exit W.W.



2.	     U.N. Representative of China.



H.M.	Malik in chair of Sec. Council fr. to-morrow.  May repeat his attempt to get ruling tht. Peking shd. be repd: Ch.K.Sh. shd. not.  Acheson has suggd moratorium until Korea is over.  My view:  either such a procedural motion or vote that no decision be now taken.  We shd. lose on a vote for seating Peking &amp; U.S. wd. be outraged.  If procedural motion, Jebb cd. say we wd. vote in favour of P. if there were a vote on that.



P.M.	Favour procedural motion to p’pone decision pro tem.



J.                x|	Cdn’t we propose tht. neither Chinese Govt. be repd.



P.M.	U.S. wdn’t accept that:  and R. wd. say Council was not properly constituted.



H.McN.	Procedural motion wd. satisfy U.K. opinion.



H.D.	Cd. we propose x/ &amp; let it be defeated.



H.S.	Not in accce with U.N. Charter.



A.V.A.	Cd. we abstain:  some U.K. opinion is coming round r. Peking because Korean situation &amp; their unreasonable attitude.



H.M.	i) Let Jebb take it gently.

	ii) Tell W’ton it’s diff. for us to do more in view of Admiral’s evce in Congress Cttee.



E.Sh.	Support A.V.A.  Peking won’t recognise U.N. peace overtures.  Peking is also at war with U.N. Forces.  U.K. now suffering casualties.



			Agreed:  support “moratorium” for the time being.





3.	     Central Africa:  Closer Association.



J.G.	Strong case on merits. In addn, pol. reason because pull for assocn of Rhodesia with S. Africa.  Want to reverse that by northward attractn.

	Diffy:  must be adequate safeguards for Africans.  Cttee have done their best to secure this

a)	By divn of functions reservg. to local govts. the matters affectg. Africans most closely

b)	By includg. M/African Affairs in Fed. Cab. responsible to H.M. Govt. thro’ Govr. Genl.  He has in effect a veto.

c)	African Affairs Bd. representg. each of 3 territories.  If these safeguards were worked well, Africans wd. be protected.  But diff. to get Africans to believe this.  Unfortunate tht., when confce mtg., S. Rhodesian Parlt. increased income limits for franchise:  may prejudice attitude twds. this report, here &amp; among Africans.

	Agreed tht. report be published.  Govts. aren’t committed.  But want to get it considered on its merits:  want people to weigh it before deciding.

		Suggest tht. later, in autumn, G.W. and I visit territories &amp; consider this at a conference locally.

	Cd. not carry this scheme r. African opposition.



P.M.	Criticism here will be top-heavy nature of the machinery.



J.G.	Inevitable because no prospect of amalgamation.



G.W.	Agree with J.G.  Objns can easily be seen:  federations aren’t good.

	But it is fedn or nothg.  And, if nothg., serious risk of S. Rhodesia drawg. into S. African.  Migration into the Rhodesia’s from S. Africa is alarming.  New pol. Party now started in S. Rhodesia advocatg. union with S. Africa.  Grave threat to our native policy in Africa.

	Recommns were unanimous – by offls. from all territories.

	This is only way of balancing S. African views.  A Br. and anti-republican bloc.  Best way of checking migration fr. south.

	Main probm to Africans wd. be reservg. matters affectg. them to local govts. still controlled by C.O.

	Danger of S. Rhodesia rejecting this.  Some hope of getting their support while Huggins is P.M.  And he wants U.K. “commendation”.

	Sel. Cttee of S. Rhod. Parlt. has produced scheme for Dom. States.

		Huggins wd. back this in default of acceptance of this scheme.

		Embarrassing to give Dom. states to this white oligarchy.



P.M.	Careful preparation – with Press and with all political Parties.



G.W.	Shd. we settle our policy before proposed conference in autumn.  Shd. there be a Cab. Cttee on this?



H.M.	Real problem here:  believe this scheme or somethg. like it is necessary.  Mechanism is top-heavy.  But M/Afr. Affairs, if it works, will help with U.K. opinion.



H.D.	Cd. we save adminn by amalgamtg. the 2 Colonies &amp; federatg. with S. Rhodesia.

J.G.	Not practicable.



J.	Main objective:  to get them talking about the diffies.



H.G.	What shall we say?  Do we go as far Huggins wants?



G.W.	Only to length suggested in para. 4 of Annex III.



McN.	Don’t go so far

i)	no hope of getting this agreed.  Gulf between blacks &amp; whites is too great.

ii)	is this constitution workable – in particular, the M/African Affairs.



P.M.	Para. 4 is a balanced statement.  Leave it as it stands.



E.Sh.	I agree.  Econ. posn of these territies can’t be sustained w’out some federal management.

	How will S. Africa re-act?

	C.O.S. see military advantage in this.



G.W.	S. Africa won’t like this – because they want to expand northwards.

	Press may be critical:  Govt. probably won’t say anything.



J.G.	Some doubt, since visit to E. Africa, wtr. confce shd. aim at agreed.

                  y|		Conclns.  Prefer to say it will give further considn.



G.W.	Agree:  don’t, however, exclude conclns.



			Agreed:  subject to modificn as at y/.

			               P.M. to consider Cab. Cttee (later) to formulate our

			               policy.



4.	     Egypt.



H.M.	We agreed to talk – B. forces staying in E. m’while.

	E. were not willing to discuss our proposals.  Have submd counter proposals requiring us to be about our business w’in 12 months.

	U.S. are now takg. increased interest.  Suggesting flattery and arms, &amp; offering to help with latter.  There will be trouble in H/C. if we supply arms.

	E. For. Minister wants to come to Ldn.  Better to keep negotns in Cairo, tho’ I don’t rule out Ldn.

	To keep things running, I propose to take up discns re Sudan.  We shall disagree about that, too.  Discns mayn’t last v. long therefore.

	If we cd. arrange with Egyptians for joint Army – available for W. Powers.



R.R.S.	Dec. ’50, when E. For. Minister came to Ldn., I talked with him.  He is not well-informed.  Later I spent 2 weeks in E. on holiday, &amp; had many conversns.

		Attended Cab. discn on 5/4/51, and stated my views.

	Useless to talk re Sudan with nothg. settled re Treaty.

	Their anxieties are:

		{moving combatants fr. zone.  Won’t wait until 1956.

	   x|	{Sudan

		{ training E. Army.

	When none of these ques. settled, can’t expect them to discuss Sudan.

	And, if we force them to discuss it, we shall make later discn of Treaty even more difficult.

	E. Finance Minister told me tht., if combatant troops removed fr. Canal after “emergency period”, we wd. agree to substantial B. forces traing. E. Army and civilians in the base.

	Removal of combatant troops fr. Zone is cardinal for them.



P.M.	What point in putting  Sudan fwd.  Can’t agree on that.  Will only exacerbate feeling.



H.G.	A better point to break on.  Our legal &amp; moral case there is stronger.

	Relieved at break-down.  Serious negotns on Treaty wd. have landed us in pol. diffies.  Our proposals wd. have involved £59m. capital cost &amp; addl £9m. annually.  Thus, financial diffies as well.

	U.S. intervention needed to keep our troops in E. not to get them out.

		Prs. they will come to realise that in M/E. Command talks.

	M’while let’s play for time.



R.R.S.	Are we ready to compromise on the Treaty at all?

	E. took note of 11/4 as ultimatum.  No discussion.

	Amb. was to waffle.  He gave them the impression it was ultimatum.

	No satisfn on x/ in Ambassador’s note of 11/4.



E.Sh.	No hope of satisfy. defence pact with E.

	If we get a M/E. Pact w’in or linked with N.A.T.O., E. will be bound to join.

	M’while let’s spin it out – by Sudan.

			                                                      [Exit A.V.A., G.W., T.W.



E.Sh.	Total M/E. expendre wd. be over £90 m. capital.  H.G. has given figures only for E.

	E. have never objected to presence of Air Forces in E.  Much wider area than Canal Zone.  Maybe we can get agreemt. someday on that.

	Therefore – stave off the evil day.



H.D.	Use of Israel as base?  



E.Sh.	Robertson’s visit.  Israel were v. friendly, but cdn’t commit themselves.  Nor cd. we.  But they wd. prob. agree to bases.

H.D.	I wd. sooner give arms to Israel.



R.R.S.	This approach will mean impasse on Sudan as well as on Treaty.



			Memo. approved.





5.	     War Criminals.

				            [Enter Soskia



H.M.	This differs from H.O. practice – for some political considns must come in wh. H.O. would exclude.

	Must tell U.S. and France.  And suggest consultn between the three on notorious cases., to avoid glaring discrepancy.  Tho’ this may lead us into diffies as U.S. are likely to favour excessive clemency.

	Same principle to be applied in Austria.

	Have consulted Ld. Chancellor.



P.M.	High Commr. never had power of clemency:  only power to advise H.M.



Att.G.	Delegn went too far:  High Commr. did not, however, purport to exercise a power of clemency.



E.Sh.	It was a power of mil. officers.  S/S for war never submitted to H.M.

		Can H.M. exercise clemency twds. a foreigner.



Att.G.	H.M. is only source of clemency.



P.M.	Sentences were imposed by a Br. court:  hence H.M. has power of clemency.



E.Sh.	These criminals have no right of petition to H.M.  Hence no clemency.

		Wd. doubt wtr. H.M. shd. be brought into this.



H.S.	The King constituted the courts.  If he delegated power of clemency, he can w’draw it.



H.M.	I would prefer to handle this on the basis of advice to H.M.



			Agreed.



P.M.	Basis of exercising this?  Wd. H.O. precedents be a guide.  These cases wd. turn on political considns.



C.E.	H.O. have had to take a/c of pol. considns.  e.g. Casement, Amery, Joyce, and sentences imposed during war for war-time offences.



P.M.	H.S. objected to any suggn tht. sentences were passed in hatred etc., what consns will then arise on wh. clemency can be advised?



H.S.	I agree.  Nothg. more to be done on basis of “standard” sentences.

		Now – extreme illness mght. be a ground for clemency.  Not any change in pol. circs. in Germany – indeed, that wd. be a reason the other way.  Much public support for my speech.



H.M.	I wd. not administer this on basis of public opinion.

	Impossible to lay down any set of rules.  Cases must be considered on merits.  New facts may become known.



J.	No case for automatic periodical reviews.  No heavy work, therefore.

		But agree you can’t formulate rules.  Mistake to try.  Exercise discretion in individual cases.



Att.G	Motives suggested for review

a)	small fry.  Court took a/c of that.

b)	German opinion.  Doubt wtr. this cd. be relevant.

		If it was because sickly nationalism objecting to sentences of Germans by Br. courts – take no notice of it.



R.R.S.	I have heard of disparities of sentence acc. to time when sentences passed.



H.S.	Three reviews already from that angle.



P.M.	Emphasise that in statement.  And say you don’t expect to have to exercise clemency in many cases.



H.S.	Japanese War Criminlas.  300 not tried, proposed to hand over to J. for trial.



P.M.	Let H.M. enquire into this.
