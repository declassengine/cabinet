C.M. 33 (51)					3rd May, 1951



1.	     Persia.



P.M.	Announced ad hoc Cttee



H.G.	Persians leave us money in Ldn. save currency reserve.

	B/E. are telling them to pay off their overdraft.

	A.I.O.C. haven’t paid them the £2m.





2.	     Korea.



H.M.	Tel. 2288 Saving.

	Bombing:  most urgent.  We must be sure, &amp; it must be substantial.

		We ought to be consulted.  Don’t like to leave decn to U.S.  And I wd. have wished consultn with old Doms. &amp; France.  If it were substl we cdn’t object to counter-bombing of bases fr. wh. they come.

                       x|	Cd. P.M. &amp; I with M/D. be authd to give our consent?



P.M.	If U.S. think this a serious risk, why don’t they disperse or protect their installns.



E.Sh.	How disperse in Korea?



P.M.	Have they A.A. cover?  And fighters? 



E.Sh.	Yes. They cd. have counter-attack by fighters.



A.V.A.	We aren’t supplying fighters.

		More diff. for us to object to counter-bombing.



H.G.	We shd. be consulted.  Our attitude wd. depend on circs.  If a small attack, we wd. hope to dissuade them fr. counter-bombing.  A delay of 24 hrs. cd. be accepted surely.



			Agreed:  insist on consultn but accept x/.



H.D.	On message as a whole, Acheson is askg. us to yield on everything.



H.M.	Our pressure has bn. stronger.



E.Sh.	And serious Ch. offensive makes U.S. posn more intelligible.

		A 3 wave offensive is expected.



T.W.	And Gd. Offices Cttee have made no progress.

	Sooner or later we shall have to come some way to meet Acheson’s viewpoint.



A.V.A.	The Sub-Cttee will be takg. v. serious decn.  Cab. will have to back their decn.



E.Sh.	C.O.S. wd. have to be consulted.



H.McN.	Pretty strong decn to say to U.S. this is pol., not mil, decision &amp; we must be consulted.  Serious if it involves delay &amp; loss of life.  I wd. authorise Cttee of 3 to make best bargain. with Acheson:  but I don’t believe we can insist on consultn.

	On other points, stall.  For Acheson is finished.

	Econ-sanctions:  we shall have to concede somethg.



P.M.	We shd. decide in principle tht. if heavy air attacks come we are ready to agree to counter-bombg.  But not as v. apprehended attack.



G.W.	To avoid second (risk), we must insist on consultn.



H.M.	Tho’ it must be quick.



G.W.	Ask U.S. to let old Doms. know as much as we do.  Not tht. they shd. all be consulted on crisis.  Believe fr. O.F. tht. U.S. wd. do that.



H.G.	Wider issue on wh. U.S. shd. be consulted.  If Ch. do this, they will have taken a/c of risk of retaliatn.  What intell. re R attitude in that event?  Do we have any knowledge?



E.Sh.	C.O.S. memo just ready.  Guess-work.

	Second p. of tel. – confidence by Allies:  our action justifies it.



P.M.	Implicn there is tht. MacArthur has now gone.

		Get C.O.S. apprecn quickly on tel.

		Tell Acheson we are considerg. &amp; ask him to tell old Doms. (with ref. to para. 4 on p. 2).



A.	Make it clear tht. counter-bombg. wd. be v. bases fr. wh. we were attacked not v. Shanghai.



H.D.	Also wd. be more serious (&amp; for Cab.) if attack came from R. bases.





3.	     Socialised Industries:  Parly. Control.



			                                      [Enter A.R., B. G.S., N.B., W.W., P



C.E.	As in memo.  Cttee solely on informn.



H.D.	Accept nothg. from Opposn at this stage.

		Mere fact tht. they propose it is sufft. reason to reject it.



N.B.	We offered a debate last autumn:  Opposn met it with pol. bias.

		This wd. be used for Party purposes.

		Say it’s much too soon.



P.	Limited enquiry wd. do some good:  but I yield to pol. argument.



C.E.	In a debate on this, Opposn wd. get some support fr. behind us.



H.S.	Many of them aren’t satisfd tht. there’s enough accountability.



H.G.	Fewer than there were.  And anyway pol, unwise to concede it.



G.T.	This is political.  But public aren’t fond of N.C.B. etc.  Don’t [sic]



J.G.	Eventually, what we want is examn into organisation of these industries esp. wtr. they are too centralised.  And not by a Sel. Cttee.



H.G.	And on individual indies separately.



H.McN.	Enquiry on C.E. model wd. help to clarify posn. – too many people think Minister is directly responsible for adminn of his industry.



P.M.	No clarificn at this time by Sel. Cttee incldg. Tories.



C.E.	Much dissatisfn in constituencies with these indies.  E.g. in rlway fares in Ldn.  Are we to say: we natd these, but have no control – go to the Bd.  We have created public monopoly over wh. there is not effective public control.  Managemt. is accountable to no-one.  Strong feeling among rlway men – until recently among miners too.



E.Sh.	Informn:  there may be a case for that.

	Control:  raises old controversy – P.O. or corpn.  We decided in favour of latter.  Are we to reverse that.  Not much concern among workers when wages are o.k.  Consumers’ Council.

	Ministers’ power of Dirn.



B.	Fares goes far beyond Tory proposal.

	Govt. cd. meet that feeling by subsidy.



			Agreed:  Reject proposal.

			                                                         [Exit B., P., W.W., G.S.



4.	     Fuel Economy.



N.B.	As in memo.



A.V.A.	Endorse.



			Note taken



					             [Exit N.B.

5.	     Royal Commission on Divorce.



C.E.	Public opinion wdn’t accept R. Commn unless it included some people who cd. speak for Churches.

	Mistake to suppose tht. those who shout loudly for easier divorce are a majority.  Possibly a noisier minority.

	Lawyers take technical view.  If no parsons, no lawyers.



H.S.	Public wd. assume Churches had a pre-conceived view, if not a vested interest.  Also v. large Commn if Churches “represented” – several of them.  And wd. be pressed to put “atheists” too.

		Priests shd. give evce, not be members.



J.	I was influenced by nos. – wd. mean 1/2 doz.

				   [Enter S.G. &amp; Wh.

J.	Last time only Ebor:  cdn’t get away with that again.

	I cd. consult Cantuar &amp; see what he says.



G.T.	Point of view of Churchmen can be repd. otherwise than by priests.

	See tht. you get various Churches represented, but by laymen.

	The Xian pt. view.



P.M.	 I agree – otherwise you imply laymen aren’t Christian.

	Other composition?



J.	2 Judges – one fr. Scotland.

	Lyon qua ex. schoolmaster.  Or Wolfenden.

	Adml. Boyd.  Doctor (Brain).  Lady (Wyndham) Portal.  Lady (Lawrence).  Bragg – Cambridge.  Mrs Hopkin Morris (Wales).  Dr Eileen Hulbert.



P.M.	Basis of selection.  Collectn of specialists – as above.  Or Colln of average chaps – jury  not bench.



J.G.	Council of Churches represents almost all Protestant Churches.  They wd. prob. prefer to be free – to give evce &amp; to comment.  But no bad thing to consult them – thro’ the Council.  They prob. wdn’t want clergy on:  might give a list of laymen.



H.D.	In 1912 only Ebor.  Since then power of Churches has declined - &amp; drift away fr. Churches.  Wrong therefore now to have even more than in 1912.

	Mrs White’s Bill commanded much support.  Unwise therefore to pack Commn with older people with set ideas r. easier divorce.



H.G.	Favour “jury” type of composn.



A.	So do I.



H.McN.	If you want a jury view, why have a R. Commn.  They are to examine complex &amp; diff. ques.

	Useful to get Cantuar or Council to say they don’t want clergy on it.

		But dangerous not to put anyone on w’out such a safeguard.



H.M.	Christian laymen is the right answer.



		Agreed:  Adjourn discn.  See t. of r.  J. no to sound Cantuar, even

			      privately &amp; informally, yet.
