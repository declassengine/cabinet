C.M. 54 (51)					23rd July, 1951



			[Enter 3 Serv. Min., 3 C.O.S. &amp; B.J., N.B. &amp; Att.G. &amp; B.



1.	     Persia.



H.M.	Tel. 914.  Amb., Tehran reports Harriman believes P. are in more reasonable mood.  Shah’s pressure:  Levy’s techn. explanns.  H. believes they may now be ready to talk on basis of principle of natn  &amp; tht. Govt. Mission led by a Minister may soon be required.

	Shepherd has pressed for pre-condn of easing pressure on B. staff.  H. is pressing for this &amp; also for recall of Maggi.

	H. therefore favours p’poning announcemt. of w’drawal,  State Dpt. endorse.

		To give H. a further chance.

	Seddon: revocation of permit now w’drawn.

	Cons. G. in south say w’drawal can’t be delayed unless pressure on staff relaxed.



	Mil. intervention.  Views fr. Franks, Jebb &amp; Shepherd.  All unfavourable. Shepherd:  more than 24 hrs. needed to get P. co-opn.  Timing shd. allow more than 24 hrs. after notificn.

	Seems therefore announcemt. re w’drawal shd. be p’poned for at least 24 hrs.

		But mil. prepn should be kept tuned up.

	M/E. is disturbing, however.  This: Egypt:  Abdullah.



P.M.	Advice fr. Persia is baffling.  We 1st intended long notice:  then Shepherd said 24 hrs. suffice:  now he says it’s too short.



H.M.	Circs. change.  Diff. to judge.



P.M.           *	P’pone announcement for 24 hrs.



Att.G.	H. may present us with ultimatum.  Wise to tell him now what our terms are for Govt. Mission:  in plain terms, all put together.

		What condns must be fulfilled before we can agree to send Govt. Mission.



N.B.	We sent such a tel. W’ton before H. left.  Repeat that.



H.G.		i) P. stop pressure on fields &amp; refinery

		ii) No receipts or interference with tankers

		iii) Accept principle of natn.  These are main points.



J.	Leave them a way out – e.g. don’t specify Hague decision.



C.N.S.	Propose to move some destroyers up to Abadan etc., on 27th.



H.M.	No harm in modified show of strength.



H.S.	Econ. Sanctions.  Must now either

i)	refuse export licences or

ii)	offer indemnity – to cover the firms who break their contracts.



H.D.	In reln to Persia:  we must defer final action.

	Promise to indemnify, if necessary.



H.S.	M/F have loaded another ship with sugar, since last Cab. decision.



P.M.	They must carry out Cab. decision.



	Military Intervention.  



Att.G.	Para. 4 (a): 2nd Para. Can’t agree with this view.  Gave his own.



H.S.	Nor can I.



H.D.	Astonished by this statement.



P.M.	Don’t let’s discuss substance of this ques. to-day.



H.M.	May not have to be ruled by legal advice.



G.W.	If we do go in, must start with clear aim of protecting life.



H.G.	Financial move:  shall p’pone for 24 hours.





2.	     Berlin:  Movement of Goods from West.



P.M.	695 from Germany.  Suggn of air-lift.



H.M.	Long standing agreemt. tht. authies cd. demand return of where raw material came from.  R. has recently asked for these documents:  eased off and then started again.  Dislocates movemt. of goods from W. to Berlin.

	We mght. have to air-lift again.



C.A.S.	We haven’t any.  All immobilised in Fayid.

	U.S. cd. put something in.



P.M.	Cd. only be a token.

			                                          [Exit C.O.S., Serv. Min., N.B., B.

					     [Enter Wheatley





 

3.	Control of Sale of Rented Houses.



H.McN.	Dwellings, not houses.  Mainly, these are flats.

	Forced sale of a single flat in a large rookery.

	I’m now prepd to put lower limit at £30 p.a. – thus excluding virtually all separate dwellings.

	Even so, there might be hardship cases.  To meet that, had thght l.a. might have power to exempt.  M/L.G. &amp; P. doesn’t favour that:  I wd. be willing to give the discretion to Rent Tribunal.

	Pol. advantages of doing this.



P.M.	Understand about 70% rented dwellings had rents under £30. p.a.



McN.	Yes:  but almost all separate dwelling wd. fall outside.



P.M.	But wd. include some flats wh. aren’t slums.



McN.	Doubt it:  wd. cover only worse 90% of rented dwellings.  Now it wd be only 75%.  Even so, it wd. cover many separate houses in small towns.

i) Prohibn of sale, but no control over price.  No such control anywhere in U.K.  We missed this boat 5 years or more ago.  Can’t slip in now w’out injustice to those who have bought m’while.

ii) Discretion to l.a.  We didn’t like that.  Rent tribunal mght. be better.

iii) Considering comparable legn for E. &amp; W.  But doubt if we can frame it.



Wh.	Social problem.  V. real &amp; giving rise to discontent.

	Political.  Many people pledged to support such legn - incldg. some Tories.

	Legal.  Tried to get l.a.’s to acquire.  But a) lengthy, b) l.a.’s wdn’t want isolated flats in big tenements.  Thus, want legn.

	This legn won’t cover many houses beyond those at wh. aimed.

	There are other legal diffies  Discretion to exempt:  who and basis.

		But we shd. try to overcome them because of social &amp; political pressures.



H.S.	Cd. the legn be confined, by definition, to tenements:  viz., lower rented parts of rookeries.



McN.	Ready to try on that basis.



A.V.A.	V. doubtful about the principle of prohibiting sale.

	Will rouse the owner-occupier.  We shall lose on balance.



McN.	Owner occupier isn’t touched by this – wh. is aimed at property wh. has always been let on tenancies.



E.Sh.	This shd. have bn. done, if at all, 5 years ago.

	But, if limited to tenements, not gt. risk of repercussions in E. &amp; W.



P.M.	Let us see this on basis of Bill. (Limited to rookeries)

	Also more informn on what is covered.

	Also criteria for discretion.

						  [Exit Wh.

						  

		4.	Order 1305.



A.R.	May I go on with printing of Order – with a view to laying on Thursday.



C.E.	Prayer, if any, wd. be on a day in final week.  V. diff. to get good Whipping.



A.R.	Alternative:  lay at end &amp; let the 40 days run after we come back.

		We shan’t be beat:  for employers favour it.



C.E.	They may criticise parts of it:  &amp; vote against the whole.

	There isn’t much room for discn next week.

	Wd. like to discuss with Ch. Whip.



G.W.	Why not lay on last day.  You gain only 6 days.



			No particular need to print now.  Genl. feeling in favour of 

			laying in middle of next week.



					[Exit Att.G.

	5.	Denominational Schools



G.T.	R.C.’s were given reasonable deal under the Act.  And in adminn I’ve tried to give effect to this.

        		i) Conclude we cd. amend the Act by extending definn of displaced person.  Act provided tht. they must be substantial &amp; tht. school fr. wh. they moved were not filled again.  Since Act passed, much movemt. fr. centres of cities – but central schools have bn. kept filled because rising birth rate.  Want, therefore, to include among “displaced” those who move because decn on town planning or housing.  This wd. help the R.C.’s.  

Also:  want to pay twds. extensions of existg. schools.

		ii) Help to C/E School.  Trouble because wane of village schools.  Under Act as it is, when 2 or 3 village schools are closing, 1 can remain only if it is expanded or rebuilt.  Take power in such circs. to pay grant to the 3rd, even un-altered.

		iii) Para.15.

H.G asks wtr. this will settle whole ques.



R.R.S.		No.



C.E.	Support G.T.’s plan.  This arrangemt. with R.C.’s wd. be less than somethg. wh. I offered and they rejected. (i) is clearly fair.  (ii) must be done if we are not to hinder replacement of old-fashioned schools. Will make for long-term economy, in staffing.



H.G.	Total cost mght. be £8-10m instead of £4-5m.

	Wd. pay that, however, for a settlement.

	But, if we re-open the ’45 settlement at all, we may start everyone up 	asking for much more.



G.T.	Neither Party is likely to observe agreement to stand on ’45 settlement.



H.G.	We must have agreemt. on this with Opposition Parties.



R.R.S.	This won’t settle the ques. for ever.

	Wd. be acceptable:  but wdn’t settle the R.C. community.



H.S.	Favour this plan.  But agree with Opposn Parties.



			Agreed:  G.T. authd to undertake consultns.



				        [Enter J. Willey

		6.	British Sugar Corporation Bill.



J.W.	As in memo.



A.V.A.	No objn – on basis of last Oct. decn, with wh. I disagreed.



T.W.	Folly to attack refining agreement, now.



J.	Don’t even know how you wd. wish to break the agreemt.



H.D.	Promised to nationalise refining.  That is p’poned in any event.

		Only ques. is wtr. we tack a refining provn on to a simple Bill nationalising the Corpn.



A.V.A.	I’m against nationalising the thing at all – the losing part of the industry.



H.S.	This Bill is only whitewash.  Doesn’t do anything.



J.G.	And invites discussion of why we don’t deal with refining.



H.M.	There is some point in the Bill.  Chairman thinks his power to tackle the refining agreemt. wd. be increased if all shares in Corpn were Govt. owned.



P.M.	Chairman doesn’t rate this inconvenience v. high.

	Act wd. not expire – cd. be renewed from year to year, as result of Supplies &amp; Services Act.

C.E.	May be driven to that.



P.M.	Anyhow v. diff. to defend so slight a Bill as this.



H.G.	Was in King’s Speech.  We shd. discuss this with Minister.



J.W.	We do want this Bill.



			Agreed:  S.I. (M) Cttee to look at this again.

					          [Exit J.W.

			                                                              [Enter K.Y. &amp; G.A.I.

		7.	Japanese Assets in United Kingdom.



H.M.	As in memo.



P.M.	Why  not confirm this to civilians?

                   x|		In Services, not a good thing to be taken pt. and minimum compensn is accepted as oblign of Services.



E.Sh.	Tend to agree.  Can’t distinguish between. impt. by J. and by G.

		How assess damage.



A.V.A.	Wrong to use such a fund for Service cases.  Govt. shd. look after its Servicemen.



J.G.	Col. Govts. say they wd. have to apply generally, as whole country over-run, not to special classes of ex p.o.w.



K.Y.	Too late to raise x/;  for neutral assets have bn. declared available for these purposes.  With Cab. authority, and in response to heavy Parly pressure.
