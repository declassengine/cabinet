C.M. 28(51).				16th April, 1951.



	1.	Mr Bevin.



H.M.	Spoke of his death.

	Cabinet stood – in respect for his memory.





	2.	Germany:  Control of Heavy Industry.



H.	As in memo.

	Add     i)	No Dpt. wants to retain these authorities.

		   ii)	C.P.(51) 89 – on level of steel prodn – said U.S. wd. seek

			early review of existg. agreemt. &amp; removal of all restns on 

			the industry.  Thought Fr. wd. agree when Schuman Plan

			approved.

	Scrap:  Diff. to get it out anyway, apart fr. this proposal.  Doubt if we 

		shall get much in near future.  And by 1952 we shall have to 

		think in terms of importg. finished steel products instead.

	High Commr. endorses memo.



H.M.	Seems odd tht. Fr. shd. now favour removal of restns.  But consequence

		of Schuman Plan:  they can’t have it both ways.  And fr. our

		angle their change of view is welcome.

	Early announcemt. inevitable.

	I.A.R. is administratively costly.



G.S.	1.8 m. tons of scrap last year.  This year ½ m. prospect.  Failg. that,

		steel semis wd. be almost as good.



H.D.	V. unsatisf. German potential.  Posn under E.P.U. – can we force out

		the exports.



H.McN.	Why easier to get scrap agreemt. thro’ E.P.U. or O.E.E.C.  Why not

		veto this unless we get scrap?



H.W.	V. tough line in Paris.  No further credits.  Refused to agree their

		import licensg. for more than 3/4 wks. (end/Apl.).  Will then be

		condl on their internal policy &amp; exports.  Said we wd. need to be

		satisfied on scrap.  Told them limits on their imports - &amp; have cut

		down.  Battle to be resumed end/Apl. in Paris.

	Also our bi-lateral trade discns with them.  H’to we have bn. helpful.

		Will be made condl on increased scrap etc.

	My genl. approach &amp; H.G.’s is same as H.D.’s.



N.B.	Support memo.  If restns m’tained too long, defeat objects.

	Suggd Sch. authy will allocate exports.  Hope it will be in E.C.E. and

		O.E.E.C.

	Para. 13.  Hope decln will be simult. with Fr. &amp; U.S.  Also seek

		improvemt. relns betw. Fr. &amp; G. – don’t lose sight of that.



A.V.A.	Don’t like argument in para. 11.  Said now we shall get less scrap

		under this system.

	If we have to import steel, with whom do we negotiate?  Shall we be

		subject to price pressure thro’ Schuman authy.



A.B.	i)  Break up Ruhr.  ii)  Schuman.  iii)  Relax internl controls.

	Controls are now being transferred to ii).  Shd we not know more?

	G. are at old game – pretendg. to be hurt &amp; makg. disadv. terms for

		us m’while.

	Shd. we not be satisfd tht. Schuman Plan will protect our interests.



H.M.	Awkward for us to delay Schuman Plan.

	I.A.R. is not working.

	They will sign to-morrow &amp; Fr. will make their decln to G.



H.	In reply to A.B., this doesn’t affect Law 27 under wh. R. industry is

		being broken up.  That power remains.



J.G.	Memories of ‘30’s.  G. will boss this – and same Germans.  This will

		be formidable thing.  But suppose we must now make best 

		bargain H.W. can make.



G.W.	We can’t stop that alone, w’out Fr. &amp; U.S.A.  We shd. only alienate

		Germany still more.



H.W.	We shd. now have study of implicns for us of Sch. Plan.  Must know

		where we stand.  In theory we cd. still join it.



A.V.A.	Para. 2.  Ratification will be at least delayed.



H.M.	But para. 15 – the announcemt. is only contingent.



H.McN.	But we promise in advance to dismantle these controls if Plan is

		ratified.



H.M.	Are we to use control over G. to protect our industry?

	We have always argued tht. it’s only for mil. security.



H.G.	Share misgivings – effect of Sch. Plan &amp; loss of bargaining power to

		get scrap.

	But all that’s proposed here is discns re conflict betw. controls &amp; Sch.

		Plan.  We cdn’t refuse to discuss.  We cd. use the discns to 

		safeguard our posn on both points.

	{ But can we prevent Fr. fr. makg. their view publicly known in 

	{	advance of the discns.

                      x{

G.S.	{ Offer discns w’out committg. ourselves to the principle.



H.	O.K. if we mention the 3 points we shall be willing to discuss.

			Agreed as at x/.



			Rpt. to be made on implicns of Plan.

				      [Exit  G.S., H.



	3.	Persia.



H.M.	15/4 Tel.  Sitn in Abadan improvg.  Crowds dispersed by P. soldiery.

	H.M. Amb. has provided tear-gas bombs.

				[Exit  N.B.



	4.	Balance of Civil Pay.



H.G.	We are makg. it up those in Korea.	[Enter  H.M. &amp; G.A.I.

	No doubt re 3 mos. &amp; 18 mos.

	Only ques:  15 days’ men.  Report is reasonable compromise.

		Recommend it as ½ way house betwn. N.S. men &amp; T.A.



A.B.	Must decide the main issue:



E.Sh.	I support.  Means legn for other Services (Health &amp; Fire).



			Memo. approved.

				[Exit  H.M. &amp; G.A.I.



	5.	Stone of Scone.



H.M.	Read lr. from Att. G.  Decided not to prosecute.



C.E.	Disagree.  If they had bn. working class, no mercy wd. have bn. shown

		to them.  Univ. rag shd. not be condoned in this way.



T.W.	Sunday Express – article:  how it was done.

		Won’t it be awkward if there is no prosecution.



A.B.	Why does Att. G. prosecute dockers?  And not these people?



J.	If there is clear evidence of breakg. in, there’s a clear case on

		sacrilege.

		Prosecute &amp; bind over wd. have bn. best solution.



H.McN.	Don’t let Att. G. say on Tuesday tht. he won’t prosecute.



H.M.	Att. G. to defer answering.

		{  J. and a group of Ministers to talk to him.

		{  Cab. on Thursday.









	6.	N.A.T. Command.



E.Sh.	U.S. won’t agree to announcemt. re Fechteler until seen W. Paper &amp;

		results of H.C. debate.  Also Med. unsettled.

	Suggest H.M. and I shd. see W.S.C. – explain diffies, get him to agree

		to p’ponement of debate.

	I shd. have to explain whole posn in H/C. - &amp; cause trouble with U.S.



H.M.	C.E. shd. be in the discns, wh. wd. have to be with A.E. because 

		W.S.C. is away.

	Favour trying to p’pone debate.



C.E.	H.M., E.Sh. and I shd. see A.E. this p.m.
