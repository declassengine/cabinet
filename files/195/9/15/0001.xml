C.M. 37 (51)					28th May, 1951



1.	     Parliament: House of Lords Chamber.

				   	[Enter M/Works



P.M.	Suggn by Spkr. tht. H/C. shd. congratulate H/L. on going back to own Chamber.

	Enough if Spkr said a few word fr. Chair.



			Agreed.





2.	     Memorial to General Smuts.



P.M.	Leader of other Parties v. keen.  Special Comm. posn.  Washington &amp; Lincoln already:  wd. balance these.  Wdn’t establish dangerous precedent.

	Choice of sculptor:  associate other Parties with choice.



G.W.	Support.  Won’t create awkward precedents.  No-one suggd it for M. King. Won’t upset Malan’s Party.  Tho’ he shd. be informed in advance.



P.M.	Site suggd in memo.  Open to consn: no firm decision.



G.T.	Take chance of getting open space – cf. Roosevelt Memorial.



G.A.B.	Possibly between Gwdyr House &amp; new bldg.



H.D.	Favour some dispersal.



			Agreed in principle:  P.M. to raise ques. in H.C.

			                                   C.R.O. to inform Malan.

				                [Exit M/W

					           [Enter N-B.

3.	     Persia.



H.M.	25/5 evening.  Amb. had private talk with Persian P.M. (M).  He suggd settlement by “some tribunal”.  Didn’t want U.K. Govt. interventn because risk refce to U.N.  Ready to ask his Commn wtr. inter-Govt. discns shd. take place.

	U.S. pressing us to declare we are willing to accept natn.  Times today also.  U.S. urging despatch of negotiators to meet Commn.  Hope we will approach Shah only in last resort, with a view to change of Govt.  Prefer to leave that to anon. Br. agency.

	Recommended wait 2/3 days to see effect of our reference to Intern. Court.

		Posn in Tehran now more fluid.  U.S. note havg. some effect.

                x|	Amb. might let it be known tht. Co. repves will be ready to negotiate with Commn if they are accommodatg.  I shd. announce in H/C. we are ready to negotiate w’in framework of natn provided Co’s interests safeguarded.



H.G.	Agree to these suggns.

	Natn:  are we to suggest it’s new or say we’ve told them already.



H.M.	The second.



H.G.	Agree.  Do nothing more pro tem.

	Co. sending observers to meet Commn:  ques. wtr. tht. will satisfy Persians 

		Worth adding x/.



H.D.	Shd. we leave this to their local repve.  ? Send member of Bd.



H.G.	Consistent with our line tht. we want inter-Gov. talks.  Mistake on that basis to send senior member of Co.



H.M.	Let local man go with watching brief.  If they begin to talk business we can send out someone senior.

	Parliamentary statement.  Depends what attitude H/C. take.

	After discn, balance of view in favour of statement – Tues. or Wed.



N.B.	Prepare for despatch of senior man – e.g. warning Co.  Jackson wd. be best man.



H.G.	I wd. then revive idea of strong outsider.  But believe we may in end have inter-Govt. discns.



E.Sh.	What shd. H.M. say in H/C.?  I favour statement early – prob. Tuesday. Make it clear we have agreed to nothg.  Don’t even suggest acceptg. principle of natn.

i)	We stand on contract:  rebut suggn it was signed by P. under duress.

ii)	Asked for arbitration.

	Dangerous to announce tht. U.S. are in favour of natn.  Shall be said to accept it only because U.S. favour it.  



A.V.A.	Wd. also prejudice our chances of getting anythg. from Hague Court save compensn.



E.Sh.	Having said a repve from Co. will attend Commn as observer, we ought to concede nothg. m’while.  Suspect nothg. will result fr. those discns:  posn will remain fluid.

	Say no more therefore than i) and ii) pro tem.



P.M.	Can’t dodge natn issue.  It will be raised in H/C.

	Not possible for Socialist Govt. to deny right of State to deal with a private interest.  We can’t stand on i) unqualified.



McN.	We are on record as not objectg. to Govt. action r. private interests e.g. in Satellite Countries.  We have insisted only on proper compensation. Can’t now ques. evasive answer to ques. bound to be raised on this pt.



N.B.	We’ve said it to M.  He wd. announce it.  Also given, as guidance, to Press.



H.M.	“… a settlement wh., provided satisf. in other respects, involves some form of natn ”.  That is formula wh. I shall use.



G.W.	Re-action fr. India &amp; Pakistan is better than we feared.

	Pakistan has made repns.  India wd. have done so, had it not leaked that they had bn. asked to do so.  But both wd. be most keen that we shd. concede principle of natn.



E.Sh.	If we concede that principle, we shd. encourage Egypt to do ditto. to our gt. disadvantage.



P.M.	Must keep Asia sweet.  H.M.’s formula is safe, and necessary.

		P.M. Statement in H/C. on Tuesday on these lines.



N.B.	Many Persians wd. be satisfied if they cd. work alone a small amount of the oil.  Must make it clear in Persia tht. this isn’t so.



A.V.A.	Refce to U.N.?  



H.M.	Cttee have considered &amp; think it wiser to keep out of it.



P.M.	Court might help:  U.N. would not.



H.S.	But prs. wise to bring it to Sec. Council if we had to send troops – Jebb’s telegram.



McN.	Can discuss later on that issue:  I wd. agree with Jebb.



J.	Similar statement in H/L.



			Agreed.

				    [Exit N.B.



4.	     Korea.



H.M.	May now be a chance of getting agreed statement of aims in Korea.

	Offensive smashed.



H.D.	Wallenberg, Swedish banker, said to be fishing for a settlement.



H.M.	Not at my instance.

	Good Offices Cttee ineffective because Ch. won’t deal with U.N.

	I prefer joint U.K./U.S. approach to China &amp; also prs. to Soviet.



T.W.	What of approach to N. Koreans.



G.W.	U.K.  shd. hold initiative in this.  U.S. wd. go too fast.





5.	     Four Power Meeting.



H.M.	We are now stuck.  We put out draft Agenda with all concessions we cd. make.  Also split Agenda.  R. then came fwd. with new things incldg. N.A. Treaty etc.,  Have promised U.S. we wdn’t agree to incln of N.A.T.

	Don’t want to break up offl. mtg.  Shall now remove discn to dipl, channel.  Viz., shall now act as authd by Cabinet earlier.

	Approach to Moscow wd. be 3 Power, identic. notes.



G.W.	F.O. shd. produce, for our U.K. public, reasons why we object to discn of N.A.T.  



		Generally agreed:  need to make it clear why we shdn’t discuss it.





6.	     Colonial Development Corporation.

					     [Enter Dugdale



J.G.	At the time discns betwn. Corpn, C.O., Ty. &amp; M/F.  But, whatever the reasons, T. did minute tht.  he wd. take direct charge.  Para 2 (1) can’t be denied.

	But para. 2 (2) we can’t say.  T. denies it.  Report of Bd. in June ’50 commended the scheme.  Scheme has now failed:  mistakes made.  Some member of Bd. therefore allege para 2(2).

	Only way of clearing up 2(2) wd. be an enquiry.  I wdn’t want that.



P.M.	This stinks v. badly.  You’ll have to have enquiry.  Some members of Bd. want to place whole blame on T.  We can’t say which side is right.

	If so, offer enquiry rather than wait until it’s forced on us.

	Judicial enquiry.



H.G.	Into what?  Whole scheme.  Or conflicting statements.

	If a wide enquiry, what sort of report shall we get.



H.D.	We had no enquiry into groundnuts.  Dangerous precedent.



P.M.	Public money spent by Corpn.  Minister says he isn’t responsible for failure:  members of Bd. blame one another:  we are entitled to know who is responsible.



H.D.	Wide (economic) enquiry can’t be “judicial”.

H.S.	Illustrates lack of machinery for safeguarding expre by these Bds.

	Parlt. cd. insist on enquiry.  Mght. ask for Sel. Cttee.

	Enquiry by C. &amp; A.G.  Or by firm of accountants – submd to Minister

		On the narrow point of Chairman’s action.

		Or, with assessors, into a rather wider ques.



H.G.	We know broadly why this failed.  We resisted enquiry into nuts.

		Nothg. much in this save personal row betwn. Milverton &amp; Trefyarne.

	Try to ride out the storm.



H.M.	Time to insist on public accountability of these Boards.

	Reasonable assertion of Ministerial right to be satisfied tht. all is going well.  I reject x/ in memo.  V. serious to suggest we can’t interfere.

	Enquiry:  lawyer + businessmen + T. Unionist.

	When something goes wrong, Minister shd. concern himself.



H.G.	Public enquiry into whole ques. is v. doubtful wisdom.



D.	Reith intends to make this a major issue &amp; to speak in H/L. on it.



J.	He can’t be restrained from making a personal statement.



P.M.	Must be an enquiry.  Can’t be by Bd. itself.  Can’t be Select Cttee

	I favour appointg. someone to settle narrow issue viz. which of these Peers is telling the truth.



C.E.	We must settle what is power of a Board.



D.	P.Q. for answer Wed. suggesting criminal procdgs. r. those responsible for failure of scheme.  Shows attitude of Opposn.



			Agreed:  Enquiry by a single lawyer on narrow ques.



					[Exit Dugdale

7.	     Japanese Peace Treaty.



H.M.	Preliminary ques:  Are we seeking a harsh Treaty or a reasonably generous one?  I favour the second – on genl. grounds of policy in F.E.  We must not drive them into R. arms.

		Will enhance our prestige to get this settled quickly.



G.W. 	Diffies with A. &amp; N.Z. have narrowed because Pacific Pact.  Not much remaing. diffy.  Nor with Canada.

	India wants even softer Peace.  Also want Peking to see draft.

		Best hope wd. be to allow India to comment.  Para 13 (c).  Cd. Doms. be given a chance to comment at that stage?  If not, India may object &amp; mght. swing Pak. &amp; Ceylon.



H.G.	Public opinion will have to brought along. They are behind-hand as cpd. H.M. view.



J.G.	Colonial opinion also will need careful handling.



H.S.	Support H.G.  And we shall be said to be rushed by U.S.



McN.	Will be ill-received by many Asian countries:  also by much Labour opinion here.  Shall seem to be buying them off.



E.Sh.	But U.S. occupn must end soon &amp; Treaty be concluded.  As with Germany.

		When?  And what sort of Treaty?

	To our advantage to get this problem out of the way.

	Resentment of Asian countries.  Wd. they prefer continued U.S. occupn and continuing uncertainties about J’s future.

	Must keep J. out of R. arms &amp; fr. linking up with China.



H.D.	This is v. soft.  Arts. 6 &amp; 7 place no limit on J. re-armament.  Will be a precedent when we come to German Treaty.



G.W.	U.S. play is tht. J. shd. voluntarily accept limitns outside the Treaty.



H.D.	Despatch of 8/5. from our Charge d’Affaires in Tokyo.  Sentence inciting J. to re-arm.



P.M.	Allowg. J. as sov. power to re-arm w’out control wd. be v. dangerous.

		With Germany, we accepted it a part of an internatl plan.



E.Sh.	Defence agreements can cover that ques.



P.M.	No validity in those, once Peace Treaty concluded.

	This draft (Arts. 6 and 7) concedes to J. right of self-defence etc.



T.W.	We couldn’t enforce such restrictions.



P.M.	But a dangerous nation, dominated by militarism….  Do we suppose they have bn. cured in 5 years’ occupn.



J.G.	U.S. are rushing us too much on this.

	This sort of Treaty wd. be jam for Communists in F.E.  Esp. the proposal tht. no claims against J. be met.



C.E.		i) 	Gt. bitterness r. Japs – among U.K. ex-soldiers – even now.	They won’t like a soft Treaty.

iii)	Business men fear U.S. intentn to use J. as satellite, thro’ whom to get into markets wh. will hurt us.

	Have we much chance of defending this Treaty to those sections of our public.



H.M.	Wd. you sooner see J. a satellite of Russia?



			Discussion adjourned – to a Special Cabinet.





8.	     Parliament:  Adjournment Debate censuring President of B. 	Trade.



H.S.	Blackburn is censuring me in adjournment debate.  Must I answer myself.



P.M.	Yes.  If it’s a personal attack.
