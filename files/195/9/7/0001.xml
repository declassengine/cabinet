C.M. 29(51).				19th April, 1951.



	1.	Parliament.



C.E.	Business for next week.

	23/4:  Prayers on Transport Charges.  Barnes &amp; Callaghan.

		Justified in giving long &amp; early (in day) debate on substantial

		Prayers.

	Note:  N. Health and N. Insurance Bills are both to be taken in this

		week.

	Shd. Parly. Secy. M/N.I. be 2nd spokesman on N.I. Bill?  Ty. Minister

		mght. intervene on Fund &amp; financial aspects (Fin. Secy.).



A.B.	I shall not vote in favour of N. Health Bill, if there is a vote.  I shall

		resign after Third Rdg.  I want this recorded.



E.Sh.	O-in-C. procedure – cd. be represented as temporary measure.



H.G.	Repeated his posn.



H.McN.	Cd say there was nothg. necessarily permanent in this legn.

	But must say w’in Cabinet there’s no prospect that hosp. cost will

		decrease.



A.B.	“These are of temp. nature &amp; no further charges contemplated” – that

		wd. help because feeling in Party tht. this is thin end of wedge.



H.G.	No gt. anxiety among Labour candidates.



E.Sh.            x|	Suggest H.G. meets M/Labour Health Ministers &amp; C.E. &amp; consider

                       |		what formula can be devised, and report on Monday.



H.G.	Must be consistent with what I said in Budget speech.

		Interpreting “ceiling for the time being.”



		Agreed:  follow suggn at x/.

	Govt. spokesmen:  shd. M/H. open?  If Cab. pronouncemt., better

		made by member of Cab.     C.E. to consider.



	U.N. Command Structure.



E.Sh.	Most unlikely F. will be cleared until after debate.

	Bradley:  after all it was W.S.C. who got us into this mess.



	Durham County Council.



G.T.	P.Q. by Hollis to-day.  Won’t be reached.  Have written to Durham

		promising to talk if they are willing to obey dirns.  Shall disclose

		by letter in reply to P.Q.  Don’t want to give oral answer.



H.M.	You needn’t.



H.D.	Durham are yielding.





	3.	Council of Europe.



H.M.	Assembly did in fact debate Defence, incldg. Europ. Army project, and

		cdn’t be stopped.   Indeed, Cttee/Ministers in effect condoned 

		such discn.  Hence proposal in memo. – discuss but not decide

		pol. aspects of defence ques.  Submit this with regret.  But if it’s

		all talk but no action perhaps little harm.



A.V.A.	Tel. 246. Para. 6(5).  Do you propose to go beyond that:  “general 

		aspects of peace &amp; security”.



H.M.	Not in substance – only drafting.



E.Sh.	V. reluctant to agree.  Awkward ques. cd. be raised under these

		words – esp. by people who don’t know all that’s going on

		e.g. in N.A.T.O.

	How preclude Cttee/Ministers fr. passing opinion on matters wh. 

		Assembly can discuss.



H.M.	Discuss but not conclude.

	Fact is they’ve done it:  can’t stop them:  this mght. limit them in

		future. 



H.McN.	It won’t.  If we can’t stop discn, we can now refrain fr. participn.

		Why not resist this:  not their business: competg. organn:

		won’t have it.



A.	Either that or whole hog.  What are “political” aspects of defence?



A.B.	Earlier, we took a v. strong line against.  I opposed this fr. outset.

		C/Europe is play-ground for prof. international delegates – who

		barge in on business of all specialised agencies.  Take a stand

		against.



H.D.	Glad Ministers aren’t going there again.

	Reluctant to make this concession.

	But no danger in letting them talk.  Many people there who are 

		politically distinguished in own countries.  It is there.  Much

		f. policy directed to raise Eur. morale.  This helps:  but not if

		discn of current realities is excluded.

	Safeguard is tht. this is consultative, not executive, body.  We can

		ensure tht. it remains so.

	Strasbourg is a safety-valve.

	No one wd. support us in trying to exclude all discn on defence.



		Others think we are pedantic about this.

	Strongly support H.M.’s memo.



A.V.A.	Wd prefer not to have statute amended.  Is it necessary?  Tel. 246.

		Cd it be done by resoln vice amendmt. of statute.



H.M.	By resoln you wd. have less chance of curbing discn in future.

		Amendmt of statute wd. keep Ministers Cttee to formula &amp;

		help Chairman to keep Assembly w’in these limits.

	On Cttee/Ministers unanimity practice (tho’ not rule);  &amp; we shall

		lose that if we are too awkward when in minority.

	Thought long before putting this proposal fwd.  Doesn’t worsen

		posn:  gives some protn.



			Agreed:  H.M. to have discretion up to limits of proposals

			               in memo., on basis that he is reluctant to make 

			               any more concession than he needs.

				[Enter  Wheatley.

	4.	Stone of Scone.



Att.G.	Memo. is for informn.

	On Parly statement –

		i)   shall I mention the damage – to Stone &amp; Chair.



J.	Yes, both.



Att.G.	ii)  shall I castigate the students, more or less.



J.	Unsatisf. state of the law.

	Shd. then be amendment, to cover “borrowing” e.g. fr. Museums.

	On this occasion:  it was the vandalism tht. excites public anxiety.



Att.G.	Don’t favour amendmt. of law.  No reason to expect any w’spread

		“borrowing”.



C.E.	Disappointed by Att.G.’s attitude.  If they had bn. caught at time, 

		surely there wd. have been a prosecution.  Class distinction.

	Dispute with Eire over Lane pictures.  Suppose an Irishman pinched

		them.

		On A.G.’s argument, they cdn’t be prosecuted.

	In view of lapse of time, I agree it wd. be wrong to prosecute now.

	Favour, however, review of the law.



H.McN.	Decn of Att.G. wd. meet my views on pol. aspects.

	Seek advice on means of considering future of the Stone.  Much

		responsible opinion in Scotland will be concerned about that.



A.	Favour considerg. latter point at some time.



Wh.	Tone down answer to P.Q.  Don’t want to give scope for further

		propaganda.  Condemn them in restrained language.

		Sacrilege, disrespect for sanctity of Abbey:  but don’t 

		overstress the damage.



A.B.	Support those comments.

			1.   Note Att.G.’s decision.

			2.   Wording – take a/c of Cab.’s view, &amp; suggns offered.

			3.   H.O. to consider amendmt. of law &amp; report to L.P. Cttee.

			4.   S/S. Scotland to consider ultimate fate of Stone.



				[Exit  L.O.’s

				[Enter  N.B.

	5.	Coal Board:  Borrowing Powers.



N.B.	As in memo.



E.Sh.	Powers in Bill provided £150 m.  Now, acc. to memo, only borrowed

		£41 m.  Why take further powers now?  Why have any 

		controversy?



N.B.	Because of time-limit.



E.Sh.	Then confine yrself. to extending time – if (which I doubt) more 

		investment in mines is possible.



C.E.	Legn Cttee:  thght. pol. effect wd. be bad if legn introduced for £300 m.

		figure.  I favour Bill merely extendg. time limit.



A.B.	Legn Cttee has gone beyond its functions – in commentg. on policy

		decisions of S.I.M.  On S.I.M. we discussed pol. expediency as

		well as merits.  Wd be good thing to show tht. N.C.B. has firm &amp;

		long-term plan.



J.G.	Support N.B.’s proposals.



E.Sh.	Romantic to suppose this investment can be put thro’ in 5 years.



H.D.	Proposed that it be w’out time limit.



J.	Spoke in favour of legn doing no more than remove time-limit.  This

		was view of Legn Cttee.



H.G.	Rate of investmt. will be determined by Inv. P’mme.

	Removg. time-limit alone wd. prob. suffice for 5 years.

	Shd. be easy to convince miners tht. this doesn’t involve going back on 

		Reid Plan.

	In genl. Parly sitn I shd. have thght. this wd. suffice. – tho’ I don’t feel

		v. strongly.



J.G. &amp; A.B.	Psychol. importance of selling this big in order to secure miners’

		acceptance of the Plan.  £300 m. “looks better”.



A.	Support that view, on reflection since Legn Cttee.



H.M.	No disagreement on developmt. plan.  That can be made clear on 

		introdn of Bill.  But Parly responsibility must be made effective.

		Parlt. normally puts time-limit on borrowg. powers – to secure 

		periodical discn &amp; preserve Parly control.  Control thro’

		Investment P’mme is not control by Parlt.

	Compromise  {  extend time-limit by another 5 years.

			     {  add around £100 m. to the un-spent balance.



T.W.	Depends wtr. you want to play this up or down.



N.B.	Parly control can be asserted if Govt’s borrowg. policy is disliked.

	The Plan must be a 15 year one.  Time-limits are not appropte here –

		&amp; were not imposed on gas &amp; electricity.

	Criticism is &amp; will be under-investment by N.C.B.

	I do want to play this up, qua miners.

		Favour £300 m. w’out time-limit.



H.G.	After discussion, I support N.B.’s proposal on this.



E.Sh.	I still don’t agree.

	We haven’t seen or approved the Plan.

	Maybe Severn Barrage, or hydro-electric schemes may come along –

		or atomic energy.  Better go by stages – esp. with public 

		monopoly.

	Parly sitn:  coal is dynamite.  Astronomical proposals wh. can’t be

		implemented for years – a gt. mistake.

	This may attract miners:  will repel a lot of others.



			Memo. approved.			[Exit  N.B.





	6.	Japanese Peace Treaty.



H.M.	Covering memo. brings out all new modificns of earlier line approved

		by Cab.

	General bias throughout is to make easier terms for Japan.

			Ministers objected to short notice.



			       Agreed:   Adjourn discussion until Monday.



G.T.	Can’t give agreed answer on compensn for ex p.o.w. etc., in light of

		current attitude of Austr. &amp; U.S. towards Japan.



H.G.	No.  U.S. &amp; Aust. has paid out of J. assets.  We haven’t got any.

	They won’t therefore be pressing J. for any more – U.S. won’t anyway.

	H.M. has suggd we hand over the £1¼ m. to charitable organns lookg.

		after these ex p.o.w.’s.



E.Sh.	Be careful.  Repercussions on ex p.o.w. in German hands.



A.B.	Make it available for all p.o.w.’s.



H.M.	Not so sure.  271 signatures to Parly petition (favouring extortion

		of somethg. from Japan).  Must include many Govt. supporters.

		Why don’t Whips do more to check this.



C.E.	Opposn have agreed to give one of their Supply Days for discn of this

		Motion.  Be careful re its terms.

	Will be a diff. Parly sitn.  No decision to-day.



J.G.	£1000 m. claims v. J. from Colonies.  V. intense feeling.





	7.	United Nations Legion.



H.M.	Let it be discussed:  let us try to bury it.  



G.W. 	Continuing to oppose it.
