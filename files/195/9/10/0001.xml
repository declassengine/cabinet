C.M. 32 (51)					30th April, 1951



1.	    Parliament.

			                                                   [Enter W.W., N.B., H.A.M.

	a.     Raw Materials Debate



C.E.	Opposn motion: 1/5

	[Govt. amendment.]

	Spokesmen: B/T. wd. not be appropriate now. M/S plus H.G. or E.Sh.



H.D.	Why not Govt. amendmt?



W.W.	No.  We move Spkr. to have Chair &amp; let Tory motion be amendmt to that.

		Our people will support motion moving Spkr out.



H.M.	I had favoured Govt. amendmt:  this is not merely a H/C matter.  May affect our relns with U.S. etc.



A.V.A.	That turns on what is said in debate – not on the vote.



A.	Nothg. new in these uncertainties re raw materials etc.  Known for months past.  P.M.’s announcemt. on defence.  Bring this out in debate.



P.M.	Favour W.W.’s tactics.



C.E.	Amendmt wd. imply censure on Ministers who have resigned.

	Meet this challenge by Opposn head on.



			Agreed:  Tactics as proposed by W.W. &amp; C.E.

			               Speakers:  M/Supply and M/Defence.

			               (L.P.S. might intervene to explain his new duties.)





	b.     Business for next week.



	Announcemt. of Whitsun Recess.  11th – 29th May.



R.R.S.	F/Britain Bill.  Delays – accountant’s enquiries:  1st rpt. they say shdn’t be publd until 2nd readg.  The rpts. won’t therefore be available before Bill wanted.



H.G.	We must get Bill.



			Agreed:  Take it on 10/5.





2.	    National Health Service Bill.



H.G.	Have concluded we must accept substance of 2nd amendmt.

	Messer M.P. will be given chance to move amendment.



H.McN.	Messer has bn. co-operative &amp; helpful.  Wd. please Govt. supporters.



H.G.	Other amendmts

i)	Limit Act to 31/3/52

ii)	Limit Act to 31.3.53  - Messer.

i) is out of ques.  ii) isn’t so easy to resist.  Parlt. cd. discuss posn after 2 years – continue under affirm. resoln.  Mght. concede that.  But cd. prs. square Messer if we give him his other amendment.



H.A.M.	Can work out compromise on basis of certainty for 2 years.



C.E.	Get amendmt. on Paper if possible, to avoid confusion.



H.A.M.	Is it wise to make all concessions in advance.



P.M.	Meet that by getting back-bench to put the amendmt. down.



E.Sh.	On duration:  I think 1 year wd. be enough.



G.T.	Yes:  for in 12 mos. there may be diff. sitn. (Election).



H.McN.	Vacillation over drugs did us no good.  Minimum of 2 years – anything less wd. make us seem v. weak.



H.A.M.	I made that case on 2nd Rdg.



			Agreed:  2 years.

					         [Exit H.A.M.



3.	    Festival of Britain.



R.R.S.	Communists have exploited situation.  £10 p wk. labourers &amp; £15 craftsmen:  yet they have done nothg.  Promised bonus if finished on 10/4 (second promise).  They didn’t finish.

	Considered use of troops.  Told not to have row before King has bn. to S. Bank.  Finally agreed men to finish 7/5.  Don’t believe they will finish by then.  I shd. like, when it’s clear there will be no opening date in view, to clear them out &amp; use troops.



P.M.	Politically, not thinkable.



H.McN.	Use of troops for what is not essential purpose will make it v. diff. to use them in future for essential purposes.



R.R.S.	Then I can’t promise any opening day.







4.	     Persia.



H.M.	A.E. is askg. P.N. Ques.  Read answer.

	Latest vote of Persian Parliament is tantamount to unilateral denunciation of the concession.

	Situation is difficult.  We have made every effort to negotiate.  They have not bn. willing to do so.  We cd. await events.  But monstrous injustice to us &amp; Co.:  nor cd. Persians operate the oil installns.

		Told Amb. to say we were ready to talk &amp; hadn’t said our last word.  But must protest r. uni-lateral action.

	Ships &amp; troops ready to move for protn of Br. lives.

	Br. prestige can’t afford such an affront.

	Persian Govt.: re-actionary:  not concerned with interests of poor.

		May have to threaten economic sanctions.

	Mission – haven’t bn. able to discuss with Persian Govt.



N.B.	Have detailed suggns on H.M.’s statement.

	Main ques.: wtr. we shan’t have to go long way twds natn to satisfy opinion in Persia;  &amp; if so wtr. we shan’t have to go beyond H.M.’s para 4 (i).  Clear now tht. rpts (tht. no steam behind this) were wrong.  We shall prob. have to go to para. 4 (iv).  Even Ala said 4(i) was insufficient.

	U.S. have bn. fairly near the mark in their judgmt.  We shd. find out what they think about latest move.



H.G.	What are we to do in next few days or wks?

	Are Persians going to seize Abadan refinery.  If so, what are Co. to do.

		If they remove their men, there’ll be no oil.  But to acquiesce wdn’t do.

	Persian sterling balances:  £25m &amp; free to convert into dollars.

		We can stall &amp; delay on that.



	*Offl. w. party shd. be in continuous session on this.



H.S.	Internl  Court?  



H.M.	F.O. lawyers are considering.  Tho’ it doesn’t help in short term.



H.McN.	Wd. help with public opinion in U.S.

	What will H.M. say in H/C if asked:  what will we do to protect Br. property &amp; life?  Shd. we not be firm on that.

	Shd. we move out any tankers in Abadan?



H.G.	W. party shd. draw up list of possible sanctions.



G.W.	Statement is over-full of contemptuous phrases. Unwise. 

		a) don’t be brave with words, not needs.

		b) don’t make Persians angry by rudeness.  There is some 	nationalist feeling in Persia.

H.D.	I support that view.



A.	So do I.



P.M.	i)	yes: revise to avoid annoyance to Persians or other Asiatics.

i)	Set out what we have offered.



H.M.	We haven’t published it.  Tho’ we put it to Ala informally.



R.R.S.	Persians like us.  Mistake to antagonise majority feeling.

		… Various suggns made for alterations in statement.



N.B.	Favour some refce to offer to go to Internl Court.
