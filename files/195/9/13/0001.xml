6.	     Persia.



H.M.	As in memo.



P.M.	Any comment from U.S.? 



H.M.	Don’t know…



H.G.	… Not much value in economic sanctions.  Co. are w’holdg. paymt. &amp; Persians are short of money.  But to keep them shorter still wd. tend to create condns we fear.

	If things get worse, we must put in troops.  And must then hold oil fields.



H.S.	Not a leg to stand on before Internatl Court.



P.M.	O.K.  if only to protect our nationals.



H.G.	That won’t help us:  we want the oil.



H.M.	Don’t lets take legal points or be too afraid of U.N.  Can be overdone.

		Our prestige in M/E. may be lost.



P.M.	Vigorous action – but with maximum support of others.  Hence our consultn. with U.S. &amp; Doms.  Pakistan mght. be brought on our side.

		Need for care.

	Para. 7.  Stress tht. they must now deal with H.M. Govt., not a Co.

		“H.M.G. have strongest interest &amp; they are prepd to send a mission”. Not arrange a mission.



H.S.	Threaten to bring this to Intern. Ct. or Security Co.



E.Sh.	No.  This isn’t a Co. matter.  It’s betwn. Govts.  We shd. press for Ministerial discussion.

	What wd. happen if we lost Persian oil, &amp; became dependent on caprice of a Persian Govt.  We shd. be dependent on U.S. oil - &amp; our indep. economic posn wd. be undermined.

	U.S. are playing a funny game.  Tel. suggestg. Texas Oil are being approached.  This is what I always feared.

	I have directed C.O.S. to prepare 2 further schemes.  3rd scheme involves 11/2 Divns. at start, followed perhaps by another 2.

	Wd. R. intervene.  Soviet/Iran Treaty wd. allow them to enter in north if we came in at south.  Persians wd. be too frightened of that.



P.M.	I doubt it.  And don’t rush.

	Next step is firm statement tht. we are ready to discuss at Ministerial level - &amp; threat of serious situation if they won’t.



A.V.A.	India &amp; Arabs wd. be v. us if we walked in as E.Sh. contemplates.

		We can’t start with more than what is needed to protect life.



H.D.	Must enlist U.S. support.



H.M.	They have bn. unsatisf.  Believe they are improvg.

	Have sent draft tel. to W’ton but so far have no reply.

	Our Amb. in Tehran is now favourg. a mission.  Alan Brooke.



P.M.	I now favour a Minister – e.g. Callaghan.



G.W.	Can’t consult Dom. Govts. – only our H. Commrs.

	Worried re troops.

i)	U.S. haven’t yet agreed even to our message.

ii)	Can’t ignore Sec. Council.  India wd. lead attack on us.  Don’t be tough when we can’t succeed.

iii)	Effect of 3 Divns. on rest of our strategy.



N.B.	Prepare for all eventualities.  I’m alive to G.W.’s points.  Asians do talk alike.

	But oil is so vital tht. we must be prepd for bold action.  Tho’ we cdn’t take that line w’out U.S. support.

	Shd. be surprised if a U.S. Co. were willing to operate these fields.

	Believe they will negotiate.



McN.	Don’t threaten consequences until we are clear what they are.

	Don’t minimise risks of Sec. Council.  Every anti-Colonial vote wd. be against us.  We cdn’t get 20 votes for anything which looks like intervention on behalf of property.

	Support P.M.’s view.

	Think we shd. take initiative in U.N. – to build up support there for our view.



P.M.	Must be prepd for trouble.  It may arise.

	Must enlist U.S. support and Doms.



H.M.	Cd. Zafrullah be asked to bring pressure on Persia.  e.g. thro’ Entezam, with whom he is v. friendly.



H.S.	We must not put in troop w’out U.S. concurrence.



P.M.	Can’t m’tain them w’out Iraq concurrence.



P.M.	Enlist moral support (for this message) of U.S. &amp; Doms.

	Recognise we may have to put in troops to protect lives (not property).



H.G.	U.S./U.K. p’mme mght. save posn even now.  Shd. cover whole Persian situation.



			Agreed   



P.M. 	Amend draft on para. 7. [also para 8.]

			              

A.V.A.	Is para 4 necessary.  Persian propaganda wd. twist it.  Also words “double character” – “2 main purposes” instead.



			Agreed



J.		We cd. say “mission will speak for Co. &amp; Govt. whose views are 	identical”.



McN.	Shd. H.M. go to W’ton?



P.M.	Await Frank’s re-action.



			Agreed  G.W. to approach Zafrullah – or Rahimtoolah – for 

			               pressure on Persia.  No approach to India.



E.Sh.	Warn Cab.:  any sign of weakness over this &amp; Egypt will seize Tel Akabir.

					             [Exit N.B.

					     [Enter Dugdale

7.	     Korea.



P.M.	Quite a good reply.

		Amendment at x/ on p. 2. and y/ on p. 3.

		We are telling old Doms.

		P. 4 rubber:  compete embargo.

		H. Kong:  admit we haven’t be successful.

McN.	Recognn.  Why not ask U.S. to drop Chang.



P.M.	Not in this.



			Note agreed.





8.	     Retail Food Prices.



			Approved.





9.	     Four Power Talks.





Limit of concession reached.

	Interrupt mtg. of offls.  Pressure thro’ dipl. channel.
