C.M. 49(51).				5th July, 1951.



	1.	Parliament.                            [Enter  W.W., Bottomley, Att.Genl.



C.E.	Business for next week.





	2.	New Rifle:   ·280.



H.M.	Ike is worried.  Asks for more consultn with U.S. &amp; Canada.



E.Sh.	The 300 (U.S. rifle) is not satisf.  Ike admits that.  Canadians 

		however want us not to go on with ·280.  demonstn at C.D.

		Mtg. – all agree on its merits.  Ike admits little use for rifle

		in modern war (only 20% use it).  May not therefore be so

		necessary to have the best rifle, at cost of upsetting 

		U.S./Canada.

	U.S. admit ·280 is better, but don’t want to change their type.

	Def. Cttee approved.  I have 2nd thoughts because don’t want trouble

		with U.S./Canada.  Enough diffies with them already over 

		N.A.T.O. etc.  Canada have asked for further talks.  I favour

		havg. them, at Ministerial level:  try &amp; convince them.

	In debate Wedy:  I had better speak, it’s 3 Service &amp; N.A.T. ques.  

		But I can’t say tht. U.S. don’t want the ·280.  Cd say we propose

		to talk with U.S./Canada.



P.M.	Pity you didn’t say so before this debate is asked for.



J.	Monty agrees 280 is better rifle, but this doesn’t outweigh 

		disadvantages of 2 types ammunn.



P.M.	Have two already - ·303 and ·300.



H.M.	Cd this be reviewed by Def. Cttee.



E.Sh.           x/	Cd announce in advance of debate tht. we propose to have talks.



			Agreed:  proceed at x/.  Tell Opposn beforehand.



				[Enter Ld. Advocate

	3.	Delegated Legislation.



C.E.	No current diffies over Prayers – earlier inflammn subsided.

	But there is a problem.

	Suggest affirmative answers to all ques. in para. 9.



H.M.	Select Cttee or Cttee on analogy of Donoughmore.

	Danger of giving any power to amend, or recommend.  Sel. Cttee wd.

		therefore be dangerous.



A.V.A.	Shd. H/L. be on Sel. Cttee.



H.D.	No:  quite unacceptable.



J.	They can be useful.  And they cd. appoint a Sel. Cttee of their own.

		Mght. be embarrassg.



P.M.	In any event, don’t appoint before autumn.



C.E.	But I must reply to W.S.C. before end/Session.



P.M.	Say only we will revert to this next Session.



			Agreed:  defer considn.

				[Exit  L.O.’s

				[Enter  P.M.G.

	4.	Broadcasting Report.



	(i)	Regional Devolution.

C.E.	Wales.  Strong case for separate system.  Only arguments against are

		adminve convenience.  Wales wants more than Adv. Council.

		They are not convinced by argument tht. they do better as part 

		of larger whole.  For they value own culture, language, etc.

	Many Welsh M.P.’s will be gravely disappointed by W. Paper.  We

		shd. go further to meet them.



P.M.	Agree:  not enough has bn. done.  This is one of few things in which

		concession can be made to nationalism.



G.W.	All of Beveridge wdn’t satisfy extreme Welsh opinion.  Nothing less

		than a Welsh B.C. wd. satisfy them.

	But serious to go further than W. Paper.  Bev. starts by stressing 

		indepce of Govrs. &amp; their collective decns.  Then suggests 

		separate Govrs. for Regions.  Can’t reconcile the two.  Staff:

		conflict of loyalties:  movemt. of staff fr. regions wd. be harder.

		W. Paper goes as far as poss. w’out separate Corpns.  Bringing in 

		l.a.’s makes them repves, with less danger of nationalism.

	Powers (paras. 18-21) – to settle p’mme in consultn Controller.  B.B.C.

	  |	cdn’t do anything save by agreement.  “Settle in conjunction”

	x|	 means that last word rests with Govrs.



McN.	I thought not, when we settled the phrase.



G.W.	Must be so.



C.E.	Apparent autonomy, not real.  That will cause trouble.



H.G.	Important pressure is not from nationalists, but fr. Welsh M.P.’s –

		a more representative group.  Tho’ gather P.M.G. has since 

		persuaded Welsh Labour M.P.’s to accept W. Paper plan.

	If poss., we ought to go as far as Bev. Rpt.  Said that isn’t possible.

		But W. Paper formula, give x/ above, gives even less than I

		thought.  The local body shd. at least have last word on local 

		p’mme.



P.M.	Why shd. we support these administrative arguments, w’out regard

		to politics.



G.W.	Because we are retaing. U.K. Corpn with collective responsibility.

	Bev. proposals are vague &amp; diff. to run.



H.M.	Bev. didn’t give any rational thought to this at all.

	Can you let a local body determine expenditure.  If they have last

		word, they control expre.  Recruitment of staff.

	Are you sure tht. popn of S. Wales (incldg. Cardiff &amp; Newport) want to

		take the p’mmes desired by the northern shepherds.  Probably

		dud p’mmes.  This is balmy.  What about arrangemts. for pol.

		b’casting.  Wd stimulate nationalist b’casting.

	Will Cab. consider merits of this, not its politics.

	Doubtful if nationalist pressures reflect majority view.

	Only doubt is wtr. G.W.’s plan goes too far.



N.E.	Welsh Labour M.P.’s have promised to support W. Paper scheme.

		Body in Wales apptd by repve bodies – cdn’t be said to be stooges

		of Ldn.  Composn of body wd. reflect density of population &amp;

		have a fair repn of labour.  Selectn (now) of advisory body by

		B.B.C. gives too much repn by nationalist opinion.

	Powers.  On home p’mme local body wd. have power to settle:

		75% of listening in Wales is to Light P’mme.  On natl p’mme,

		finance, engineering etc., they wd. be advisory.  Think G.W. 

		got it wrong at x/ above.

	Whatever we do, we can’t satisfy all conflictg. views in Wales.

	This is the right pattern for devolution.



H.D.	We must make some concession.  There is much feeling.

	I wd. accept P.M.G.’s plan, as he put it:  but it needs to be made

		much clearer than in W. Paper:  and made more attractive.

		Stress the fact tht. their activities will be confined to local

		p’mme.



P.M.	Limit its scope, but give it power of final decision.



McN.	Offer less than Bev. &amp; we shall have pol. trouble, to wh. we shall

		prob. have to bow.

	Corpn must be able to have last word on finance.



P.M.	Some concession to Wales &amp; Scotl.

		They must have control over local p’mme.

		Make our concessions clear:  don’t fluff it with

		words like “in conjunction with”.

G.W.	What about finance, engineering etc.

	Corpn must presumably have power to define scope of local autonomy.



H.G.	Let them determine content of p’mme w’in a budget fixed nationally

		after discn with local bodies.



E.Sh.	Why do they want this autonomy?  Wales is not separate nation, nor

		even united nation.  What about autonomy for Durham – they

		are different from Ldn.  This is all a lot of damned nonsense,

		and won’t satisfy nationalists.



G.W.	What about the English Regions?  Shd. we not concede same to them.



H.D.	No – unless pressure develops.



N.E.	Appointment of advisory bodies in English Regions.

	H’to B.B.C. have appointed – nonentities.  I wd. prefer to apply to

		English Regions same system of apptmt as for Wales &amp; Scotland.



H.D.	Pity to limit this to l.a.’s in England.



P.M.	Wd also stimulate demand for some more powers as in Scotl. &amp; Wales.

	Prefer Govt. shd. appoint.



G.W.	Bev. recommended that for Scotl. &amp; Wales.  Why shd. we accept it for

		E. but not for Sc. &amp; W.



H.G.	Unwise for Govt. to appoint.  No concession needed to E. regions.

		Is there any complaint.  I wd. prefer status quo:  appointmt by

		B.B.C.



			Agreed:  status quo in English Regions.



	(ii)	Finance.

H.G.	If we allow 100% for 3 years, incldg. a period of re-armament, it

		will be permanent.  Television may cut revenue from cinemas.

		Must preserve right to take some propn.

	In Budget debate, Waterhouse proposed a cut in grant to B.B.C.

		Opposn cdn’t make much of a fuss.



G.W.	Won’t be popular;  for people think it’s a fee for B.B.C. service.

		If revenue wanted, tax the receiving set.



H.G.	Let’s go back to 85% - where it stood before.

	And drop proposal re borrowing powers. (?)



N.E.	Figures based on ’49:  costs etc., will rise.  B.B.C. may have to borrow

		from Ty.



H.G.	Make it clear we reject Bev. proposal for higher pay for Govrs.

			Agreed:   85%



	(iii)		Staff.

A.R.	Paras 46-48.  Recommn 93:  recognise its importce &amp; say consultns

		are procdg.  Add a new para.		Approved.



	(iv)		Organisation.

H.D.	Views of young Wedgwood Benn.  Seem useful.  Perhaps we cd.

		leave ourselves free to consider.

	Organisation.  Excessive power in Dir. Genl.  More devolution of

		 authority.

				[Exit  W.W., N.E.

				[Enter  P.

	5.	Spain.



H.M.	On mil. grounds, quite a strong case for assocn:  &amp; in war we shd.

		have to do it.

	U.S. have nibbled at it:  Franco may be askg. a high price:  politically

		in U.S. it wd. be convenient for Adminn.

	Logic:  cd. say we are friendly with Yugoslavia &amp; Portugal is in

		N.A.T.O.

	Politically – here &amp; in France &amp; perhaps in Scandinavia – I don’t 

		think it’s possible at this stage.

	What then do we do vis-á-vis U.S.

	French Amb. thinks we shd. press U.S. to drop it.  Ready to do that:

		but my view is tht. we shd. add Fr. mght. accept that, reluctantly.

		If they won’t, at least go slow.



P.M.	I agree.  We shd. put it firmly to U.S.

	In particular, can’t have Spain in N.A.T.O.



E.Sh.        	i)	This is a N.A.T.O. matter.  Going about it the wrong way.  U.S. 		start it off, without adequate thought – as they did with G. 

		re-armament.  This isn’t for U.S./U.K. alone.  Wrong to do it on

		bi-lateral basis.

                	ii)	Mil. aspects.  No discns even with U.S. yet.

		Portugal:  in N.A.T.O., with similar regime.  Can discriminate.  		P. is of no value to N.A.T.

                	iii)	Object of U.S. is to get bases in Spain.

		W’in N.A.T. they wd. need equipment - &amp; we have too much of 		that already.

	Isn’t it about time we tried to understand U.S. strategy.  Is theirs an air

		strategy?  They haven’t gone v. far to build up strong land forces

		in W. Europe.

	Public opinion in U.K. – wd. be strong opposn:   doubt if there is any

		strong support.

			Conclude – talk this out in N.A.T.O.



P.M.	No.  Make our posn clear at once to U.S.



H.D.	Agree.  i) no arms to spare for Spain.  ii) perimeter defence wd. ruin

		Europ. morale.  In addn to over-whelming pol. objns.



P.	I take opposite view.  On mil. aspects we must have regard to C.O.S.

		Get Allies first &amp; then see about the weapons.

	No one is keen on Franco.  But are Yugoslavs or Turks any more

		democratic.  Real ques:  shd. we allow Spain to help us in war?

		Folly to decline to plan in advance.



R.R.S.	What of E.Sh. idea?



E.Sh.	Avoids saying “No” at once.



H.M.	Don’t want this troublesome ques. debated in N.A.T.O.

	Wd sooner try to convince U.S. bi-laterally that this is off, pro tem.



E.Sh.	Thght. you feared a bi-lateral U.S./Spain arrangemt.  That wd. be

		much worse than talking in N.A.T.O.



H.M.	I want to try to choke U.S. off altogether.  If I fail, I may have to 

		suggest N.A.T. discn.



G.W.	I want to keep Doms. informed.	Agreed.



	Naval Cruises in Spain.



P.	Wd be normal to resume such visits.  Slow start, with couple of

		destroyers.



P.M.	What advantage?

	Franco wd. exploit it.

	Our supporters wouldn’t like it.



P.	Admy think there is naval advantage.



H.M.	Gives R.N.	 experience of Spanish waters.

	Mght. influence Sp. opinion favourably.  We shd. jump at a chance

		to do this in Soviet ports.  May, however, be necessary to give

		way to the point of prejudice.



P.	U.S. &amp; Dutch have done it.



J.G.	V. grave political disadvantages.



P.	This will handicap R.N. in training exercises.

					[Exit  P.



	6.	Staff for Defence Work.



H.G.	  i)	Para. 9(ii).  I wdn’t order Tizard.

	(ii)	“released”



E.Sh.	This doesn’t go far enough.  I am proposing somethg. more drastic.



P.M.	Ministers must take a line on this, themselves.



E.Sh.	Tizard doesn’t want to do 9(ii).  Prefers Adv. Council shall do it.

	We need compulsory powers to transfer people.



H.M.	I have no objn qua F.O.



H.D.	Have the “offers” bn. accepted?



H.G.	Under discn.



H.D.	I offered 15% of my staff:  none have been taken up.



P.M.	M/Works cd. do more.



H.G.	The Minister will help on this.



			{  Memo. approved.

			{  M/D. proposals awaited.





	7.	Persia.



H.M.	Since Monday, message from Mason takg. less optimistic view of 

		morale than Drake.  Doesn’t expect to stay in Fields for more

		than 6 weeks.  Staff prepd for gradual evacn:  change of policy

		now wd. rattle them.

	Amb. suggd we shd. tell P. Govt. we are w’drawg. because their

		intervention has made posn impossible.  On balance, I doubt

		this.  Hold on but protest.  Alternatives  i) Monday’s decision.

		ii) Pull right out &amp; tell Persians.  iii) Phased w’drawal.

	Persian action.  Mason “sacked”.  Interference with officials generally.

		Search of aircraft.  Staff under tension.  Expectg. evacuation:

		will want good reasons for reversal, as well as 100% protection.

	Policy of keeping going – approved by U.S. &amp; Opposn here.

		I’m in favour of m’taining that.  Tho’ staff morale may force us

		to get out before v. long.

	Tel. fr. Franks, who saw Acheson at once on his return.  U.S. Govt.

		much concerned.  W’out oil revenue any P. Govt. wd. collapse.

		A.I.O.C., if they went out, wd. never return.  What did we think 

		of troops?  O.F. replied:  for Br. lives we cdn’t guarantee not to

		use force.  A. asked how we cd. buy time?  Truman considering 

		interventn by means of intermediary like Harriman.  Only 

		constructive idea:  accept natn in principle, but entrust managemt.

		to a Br. Co. at a fee related to old profits.



P.M.	Dangerous to allow U.S. to “mediate”.  We want them to support

		our line.



H.G.	This “idea” is no different from what we have suggested.

	If U.S. will weigh in with Persians &amp; support our line, it mght. help.



P.M.	Shd we let Persians know tht., if there’s more trouble, we have troops

		in readiness.



J.	Wait for Hague decision.



H.M.	Then we cd. begin to talk in stronger terms.



McN.	If Hague decn is in our favour, U.S. cd. be pressed to come out in

		support of it.



                    *	Major mil. operation – to come up to Cab. on Monday.

	Read draft of statement to be made in H/C. to-day.



J.	Too long, argumentative and stale.



McN.	Unwise to build up picture of humiliation.



E.Sh.	Refce to Mauritius suggests she cd. do somethg.



H.D.	Also “all other measures taken to protect staff…..”

		Not true.



H.M.	Must say:  “all practicable steps”.



G.W.	Don’t use word “pinpricks”.



J.	Omit “Needless to say”.



H.G.	‘Bringing installns to high point of efficiency.’

			Make the point tht. we built it.
