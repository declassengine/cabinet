C.M. 55 (51)					26th July, 1951



1.	     Parliament.

			                                                             [Enter Att.G &amp; W.W.

C.E.	Business for next week.

	Points of Privilege – likely to be discussed further on 1st Aug.  Lady Mellor, r. attempt to discuss Barclay letter.



H.D.	Sooner have that discussed than New Valuation lists – on wh. we wd. prefer to stall.



H.G.	Opposn interest will be on behalf of industrialists.



R.R.S.	Lady Mellor:  is it recommn tht. ques be dropped?



C.E.	Divn on Party lines:  breach of Privilege, but H/C. shd. take no action.  Tories object to finding that it was a breach.



P.M.	What caused y’day’s trouble over Barclay letter?



C.E.	Kitchen Cttee asked for refce to Cttee of Priv.  As they had 2 others, Cttee cdn’t have handled this before end/Session.  Tories supported by motion tht. it was a libel:  I moved tht. he be called to Bar:  thght. excessive:  so I said prs. he wd. apologise.  Then it was adjourned (Tues.).  On Wed., lr. of apology received.  Tories agreed we shd. accept that.  Our supporters were told.  But Silverman &amp; Co. objected, when it was raised.



P.M.	But why did you stop debate?  After adjourned prev. day.  Shd. there not have bn. Motion acceptg. apology?  That wd. have settled it.



C.E.	Might have bn. preferable.  But awkward squad wd. object to any course.



J.G.	Largely personal.  Our people are v. much enflamed v. this journalist.

		They were out for blood.



C.E.	Will come up at Party mtg. this p.m.   They are now after my blood.

		May  have to agree tht. it be discussed on Wed. next after the 2 other cases.



P.M.	At Bar he can only apologise.  If he wants to argue or explain, he must do that before Cttee of Privileges.



H.S.	H/C. is getting far too touchy about Privilege.  Brings H/C. into disrepute.

		Makes them look undignified.



P.M.	Yes:  our people especially.



C.E.	Dates of adjournment.

 				[Exit W.W.



2.	     Grocer’s Margins.



A.V.A.	Minutes of E.P.C. on 19/7.

	Statement untrue. Dividends halved.



P.M.	If it was said, Minutes can’t be altered.

	Write to Chairman &amp; get fresh statement.

					[Enter N.B.

					Bowker

3.	     Persia.



H.M.	Tel 895.  Para 5.  P. has accepted apparently 2 of our pre-condns.

	But they couple this with their Cab. Minute.

	No indicn yet tht. other pre-condns will be accepted.

	This has bn. put to Persians &amp; their re-action is awaited.

	Morale of staff:  deterioratg. because of condns and also because p’ponement of w’drawal wh. they had expected.  Worrying position.

	P. are willing to receive U.K. Minister.  H. pressing for this – now is the moment.  Told U.S. Amb. we wanted assurance re operation of Co. &amp; no chivvying of staff.

	Have we now a basis for a Mission?  Do we insist on latter pre-condns?

		If we don’t send a Mission, must w’drawal proceed?

	Latest informn from Tehran.

		1) Seddon agrees with Mason’s estimate re morale of staff and prestige of A.I.O.C.

		2) Shepherd had put pre-condns to H. &amp; will put them generally to P.  Has stressed need to restore status quo in South.  No firm response fr. P.

	Door now open for discn of ques. how to implement principle of natn &amp; they might come to reasonable arrangemt. on 50/50 basis.  That’s better.  But they are still makg. diffies for staff.  And staff aren’t helping by making public complaints.  Can’t go on.  We must w’draw them or do something.

	Do we insist on pre-condns before sending Minister.  Or send him, insistg. on them.  Or tell him to insist on arrival.  I think he’d better go.



J.	Diffce  betwn. 2 pre-condns.  Can’t expect Co. to resume full opns at once.



P.M.	Must have assurance re chivvying before Minister goes.



N.B.	Found 42 &amp; 45 show intolerable P. behaviour.

	Tel. 927.  H. won’t go into this with P.  V. unsatisf.:  it’s at core of problem.



A.R.	Get Minister out w’out pre-condns.  Let Minister insist on havg. this stopped.  



H.G.	Humiliatg. if they refused.

	H. must be pressed to get assurances on this point.



A.R.	Do you suppose a Minister less effective than H. in getting it stopped.



R.R.S.	Don’t press for re-starting refinery.  But insist on instns being given by P. Govt. to stop chivvying.  And, if they continue despite this, Co.’s employees must keep quiet.



H.G.	No sign of improvemt. in south.

	Mistake to dash after this at once.  See what H. gets out of them.

		Wait until Co. has regained control over undertaking.



E.Sh.	And if P. refuse this pre-condns, what do we do?

	We have always asked for negotns.  Why draw back from it now?

	Most we shd. ask is for no further interference while negotns are on.



R.R.S.	Instns be given for no further interference.



P.M.	Get that assurance before he leaves.



McN.	Suppose negotns fail?  W’out assurances fr. P. Govt. on this, Minister wd. in v. weak negotiatg. position.

	H. hasn’t done well:  no gt. risk of affrontg. U.S. by declining to negotiate w’out assurance.



H.M.	I disagree.  Door seems open to negotn.  H. has helped.  He presses for Minister to go out now.  If we lose this opening, U.S. will complain.

	Ques.	i) Send a Minister accompanied by request for assurances.

			ii) Ask for assurance first.

			iii) Do we threaten to w’draw staff in x days.



A.R.	I favour i):  this is the moment:  don’t miss it.



P.M.	I disagree.  They will think we are yielding.  Suppose sitn doesn’t improve &amp; Minister has to come home.

	Must insist tht. P. Govt. shall give instns tht. interference shall stop.



G.W.	Make it clear tht. we welcome chance to talk &amp; want to send a Minister.



H.G.	Use, with P., argument tht. staff won’t stay unless this stops.



P.M.	The things to stop.  H.M. read out the pre-condns.



H.S.	They go too far.  Can’t expect P. to accept all those.

	 	“Pushing around shd. cease.  If it doesn’t Minister will return.”

		Say that publicly before he goes.

	Can’t expect P. to agree tht. Co. shd. resume control.



H.G.	Tel. 301.  On that basis I believe staff will go.  They believe tht., unless Maggi goes, condns can’t improve.



J.G.	What if we miss this chance &amp; H. goes home.  He thinks this is the moment for U.K. Minister to go.



P.M.	[Welcome:  want send Minister:]  but he can’t negotiate while staff are being pushed around.



J.G.	How much of staff’s complaints are due to their dislike of natn.



H.G.	They won’t serve a P. organn – only B. agency managing it for P.

		Do you want staff to remain, during negotns.

		Make it plain to P. privately tht. they must lay off our staff - &amp; if not we may have to w’draw them to Abadan.



	{	H.M.	      May I say to P. &amp; U.S. Govts. [].  But can’t send him 

	{                      while staff are pushed around.  Must ask P. Govt. to

	{                      assure us they have taken effective steps to stop it.

            Agreed{		      Mght. add request for w’drawal of Maggi.

	{      R.R.S.     Don’t make Maggi point a condn.



			Agreed: an unofficial suggestion.



H.M.	Avoid statement in H/C. if possible – before Monday.



	Agreed: Co. to be told (N.B.) that staff must hang on &amp; 	shut up.

	P.M. &amp; H.M., with H.G., to settle which Minister.





	Economic Measures



H.S.	Can’t go on as now.  Sugar cargo gone:  on basis of requisitg. later:  doubt if this is possible.  B/T. action was on understandg. tht. Cos. wd. agree to interception.

	Must now let things go or refuse licences.

	Must decide wtr. it’s all goods or scarce goods.  E.g. licences for switch gear.

	My view:  let these things go if a Minister is going out.



G.W.	Agree:  a new situation.



P.M.	I suppose so.



			Agreed:  Relax this, when a Minister goes out.

			                                                            [Enter B. &amp; Wheatley.

4.	     Order 1305.



Att.G.	What is a T. Union for the purpose of this draft?

	 i) w’in Act of 1913.  ii) they are a T.U. wh. have habitually resorted to 		the negotiatg. machinery or iii) tht. they represent a substantial 		no. of workers in the industry.

	For Town Clerks the task is to bring themselves under I).



H.S.	I don’t think they cd. do that.



A.R.	They wd. fail under iii) for “the industry” = whole of Local Govt.



J.G.	We shd. not seek to prevent any organn fr. becomg. a T.U.

		This was a bad affair because l.a. assocns handled it ill.  We can’t legislate for this idiocy.

	Can’t take the line tht. professional people can’t have Unions.



A.V.A.	They cd. affiliate for these purposes with N.A.L.G.O.



G.T.	Most of them are members of N.A.L.G.O.

	Don’t lose substance of this Order for sake of Town Clerk shadow.



P.M.	Section 4.  Repn of natd indies?



A.R.	Suggd incln in order of requiremt. to consult them.  Discussed with Benfield.  Don’t believe cases wd. go to tribunal.  B. said we wd. prefer natd indies repve, if they had to go, than repve of private industry.  But wd. open door to L. Govt., I.C.I. etc.  Asked B.E.C. if they wd. include repve of natd indies among their nominees.  They agreed, on understandg. I promise not to put that man on Bd. when it was hearing private industry claim.



H.S.	Support this.  But note there is no sanction for comp. arbitn.

		They can strike before arbitn &amp; go on doing so afterwds.



			Approved.

			                                                [Exit Att.G. &amp; Wheatley



5.	     Man-Power for Railways.



B.	See force of objns.  Applies only to limited no. of rlwaymen.  Executives &amp; men are considerg. v. onerous proposals. Some contn by govt. wd. help.

	Freight  next winter is threatened with disruption.  If we get this in autumn (instead of end/winter as in ’51), much more drastic action will be necessary.  Can’t promise to move coal, steel &amp; timber this winter:  all expert opinion agrees.  Loss of prodn will far exceed this 3.000 deferments.

	Covers only individuals in diff. areas – when wastage worst &amp; traffic heaviest.



P.M.	What do you propose to do to arrest drift of others to other indies.



B.	Can’t do anything.



P.M. 	Wd. it be condn of deferment tht. they stay with rlways.  



B.	Yes.



A.R.	Depends at what age they drift away.

	My reason for rejection

		a)General.  Universal liability to service.   We wd. never have got it on selection basis.  Mining &amp; agric. later expected.  But agric. exemptn is being w’drawn.  And most people think mining is diff. (&amp; unique) because dangerous.

	Cdn’t do this for 12 months only.

	What industry wd. come next?  Draftsmen?  Key men in munitions factories?  Examples cd. be multiplied.

	About 25.000 a month called:  only 17.000 get thro’ because medical etc.

	We shall be 17.000 down on call-up.

		b) Special.  Deferment shd. not be condl on changes introduced.

	Alleged short of operatg. staff.  But look at Biff/Buff advertising – wh. says more passenger seats than any year since war.  Special trains.

	Fall in their nos. coincided with argument over wages.  Has bn. arrested since settlement.

	Rlway Tribunal Rpt:  Executive evce was v. different than what they say to us now.  On wastage they then said they were no worse than other industry.  Overtime &amp; rest-days also:  evce conflicts.

	Wagon-shortage for coal – 150.000t.  A minimal amount:  they steal more than that in a year.  Never have bn. enough wagons in winter.

	Solution to this is re-organn w’in industry.  Can’t agree to make this condl on deferment.

	Lodging turns.  High propn of men working trains one way &amp; travelling back as passengers.



N.B.	Rlway posn is v. serious – esp. for coal.  Trains embargoed round Ldn. for wks., when house coal stocks are v. low.

	Hoping for 4m tons more prodn in winter.  Will rlways carry it?

		Must move max. before winter weather.

	N.C.B. &amp; Exec. had joint w. party.  Did v. well.  Our margins are so small tht. we shd. soon reach crisis.

	Something must be done.  Hope deferment can be agreed.  Hope training on rlways can be arranged.

	Long-term soln = continuously braked freight trains – to run at higher speeds.  Shd. get more of them, at expense of passenger rolling stock.



B.	Answer to M/L.  Lodging turns:  we wanted this part of settlement but M/L and Cab. urged quick settlement because cdn’t risk major stoppage.

	This is only one contn to major problem.



P.M.	But there seem to be many alternatives wh. wd. be more profitable.



E.Sh.	If M/T had discussed with me &amp; A.R. in advance, we cd. have shown him diffies of his plan.

	Large wastage on rlways.  That’s the thing to tackle.  Not keep back 2/3.000 men who aren’t necessarily key men.

	2.900 is a Brigade.  And we aren’t getting our nos. on call-up.

	Further economies in use of man-power – throughout industry.



B.	And in Army!



E.Sh.	We did go into that.  Have you done the same?



E.Sh.	This violates principle of universal liability.  Defer in one depot &amp; not in another.  Think of trouble that will cause.

                 x|	We will seek alternative proposal re training w’in rlways.



P.M.           {	Reject main proposal.

                   {	Consider x? (by officials as urgent ques).



C.E.	Party mtg. at wh. rlway repves made v. gloomy prophecy re state of rlways in early autumn, in relation to a Genl. Electn in Oct.	

							                     			[Exit [sic]

H.D.	Some greater effort shd. be made re lodging turns.



E.Sh.	Can we not approach T.U.C. re waste of man-power in industry.



J.G.	Excess of supervisory posts.  Cover that.



E.Sh.	Hope P.M. will have that considered e.g. my M/L. or otherwise.





6.	     Assisted Passages to Australia.



G.W.	Cab. decision of 28/6.  In my talks I have taken that line.

	My main motive was economy.  This was only contn I can make.

	Also object to paying people to emigrate.

	Austr. counter plan to offset £100.000 won’t come off.  My plan wd. be 250.000 vice 1m.

	M’while Menzies has said he will leave to cut expre on migration because it’s inflationary.

	We cd. keep our 1/4m going thro’ the year.

	Other countries may ask for same facilities.  I want bring whole assisted passage scheme to an end, over 3 years.

		Renewg. Emp. Settlement Acts fr. year to year.

	Can get consultn with Doms. re advertising, w’out our paying.



P.M.	General shortage of man-power.  Yet we do this.



H.M.         x|	Must keep Anglo-Sax. stock high in Doms.



P.M.	Tho’ why shd. we pay for providg. them with their best asset.



A.R.	My memo is by Dpt. [G. Ince].  But I agree with x/.  Can’t we reduce the amount?  It’s v. high now.

	Don’t announce now we are going to end this.



G.T.	Policy originated in unemplt. here.  Situation is quite different.

	Play it down:  cut down expense:  leave it to Doms. to entice.



H.S.	Sympathise with M/L.  Why announce?



G.W.	Agreemt. runs out this year, &amp; Acts next.

	Must give warning ahead – to avoid letting people down.



P.M.	Act doesn’t expire until May.



H.D.	Right tht. more Anglo-Sax. people shd. be in Austr.

	But reduce to £10 &amp; let it run on.



G.W.	£10 with a ceiling of £250.000?



A.V.A.	Return traffic is beginning because condns are so bad there.



G.W.	£800.00 ceiling now.

					      [Re-enter H.G.

H.G.	I wd. accept.  £10 and ceiling of £500.000.



			Agreed.

		                                                                     [Exit B. and

			                                            [Enter A.H., J.S., Brown, Edwds.



E.Sh.	H.G.’s plan doesn’t give us the men.  Other Dpts. won’t yield them up.

	Action I recommend is drastic.  for sitn is v. serious.

i)	Compulsory transfer from civil Dpts.  Not easy

ii)	Suspension of recruitment by civil Dpts.

iii)	Pay increases.



P.M.	Have natd indies been milked?  How many in mines, rlways etc., workg. on long-term projects.



N.B.	In mine, we need them:  for capital investment.



H.G.	On (i):  no objn in principle.  But clear Cab. directive needed on principles  e.g. 

		a)  w’draw fr. Dpts. with cuts on investment P’mme.

b)	…  Clear backing from Cab.

	(ii) is not appropriate.  G.P.O. might e.g. need more people.  Recruitment is organised centrally:  &amp; C.S.C. can be instructed to give highest priority to Defence work in allocatg.

		No temp. staff shd. be recruited w’out Ty. authy.

	(iii) Await Gardiner report – due in a few days.

	(iv) No objn.  



H.D.	I support this.



G.B.	Mtg to-day:  but much turns on what you will tell l.a.’s not to do e.g. developmt. plans.



McN.	Exemption for housing?



H.G.	Can’t start on exemptions.



H.D.	We can find other means, w’out damage to housing.



H.G.	(v) or (vi).  No objn to (vi), after consultn with Ty., tho’ expensive.

		But bounties under (v) are too difficult.  Prefer to use physical controls.



N.B.	Hope open-cast coal will be regarded as “defence”.



T.W.	And food production.



H.G.	Must have a clear line from Cab.  Dpts. will be able to argue.



G.B.	a) If Civil Ministers abate their claims, we can do more to help.

	b) Hope Prodn Cttee conclns will be followed up – on standards.



E.Sh.	I accept b).

					    [Exit Serv. Min.



8.	     Merchandise Marks.



A.R.	Look at penalties.  Make them high enough.
