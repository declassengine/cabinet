C.M. 48(51).				2nd July, 1951.



	1.	Persia.                                  [Enter  3 Service Ministers, C.O.S.,

			                                    [N.B., Barnes &amp; Bottomley &amp; Att.G.



	a)	Morale of B. Company staff in Persia.

	Bowker’s report read – interview with Drake.

	C.I.G.S. reported Persian Army anxious &amp; prob. capable of 

		preserving B. lives.

	Cons. Genl. Kurmansh.:  has sent in lower estimate of morale of 

		B. staff.



H.M.	Read out statement of latest situation report.

	Drake introduced.

	Persians won’t touch B. subjects.

	Morale of B. staff wd. be tough, if assured they will stay in Persia.

		Gradual w’drawal is shaking that morale.

	They’re determined not to be thrown out.

	Play for time – not political, for can’t assume crack in P. Govt.  But

		let P. turn us out:  don’t run away.  They wdn’t stay in Abadan

		or Shaiba w’out hope of return.  Midget is a run-out.  If they cd.

		stay 3/4 wks., with wider evacn later, we shd. strengthen our posn.

		Otherwise our whole M/E. posn will be undermined.  Iraq

		demonstn in favour of oil natn already.



P.M.	Can’t guarantee protn of people in fields.



D.	Risk of trouble is v. gtly. increased by signs of our going.

	Wd P. guarantee their safety.

	Our P. staff are 100% v. natn.  No complaints made to new P. directors.



P.M.	We want to hang on.  Denial of tankers strong point for us.  Will tell

		more in 2 wks.  Suppose we stop activities, will there be riots?



D.	Not if we say firmly we’re staying &amp; pay wages.

	We can hang on w’out producg. oil - nos. involved v. small.

	Constn work (incldg. houses) in biggest part of our establmt.



P.M.	We’re not going to scuttle.  Evacn only because danger to B. personnel.

		But we can’t guarantee to protect them in Fields.  What then?



D.	Cd we ensure protn in 3/4 weeks.  If so, they shd. stay.



C.N.S.	Not w’out war v. Persia.



C.I.G.S.	If we land in Persia, the P. Army wd. resist.



D.	Save officers, yes.

	If we cd. concentrate into 2 areas in fields, at short notice, what then?

 

C.I.G.S.	i)  Size of Force requd  ii) Lag after landing before arrival in fields.

	Favour letting P. close us down.  But does involve some risk to staff

		in Fields.



D.	I cd. uphold morale, if we cd. say firmly we are going to say.

		Moving people out, however slowly, undermines their morale.



H.M.	Put to Drake view of Cons. Genl.



D.	Over last few days prospect of evacn has weakened morale.

	If we cd. stop it, promise best we can re protn, ……

	If cd. ask P. to guarantee safety of staff.  They cd. do it.



P.M.	We can ask them to stay.  You can ask P. to protect.  We can’t.



D.	In 3/4 wk’s time?  Intern. effect of loss of oil/Hague/U.N. perhaps.



C.I.G.S.	Cdn’t give absolute guarantee because of ii) above.

	But my advice wd. be tht. it’s a fair risk.  For P. won’t allow B. staff 

		to be hurt.  B. subjects have taken that risk before.



C.A.S.	We can’t drop parachutists – to help people concentrated in 2 areas.



H.G.	What is ultimate outcome?  World opinion mayn’t be wholly in our 

		favour.  We mght. be under pressure to accept P. demands

		(receipts etc.).



D.	Deterioratg. sitn:  can be slowed down if B. staff can keep up their

		morale.  Assume P. will protect us.  Try for accommodn with P.

		And, if they can’t co-operate with us, then clear out quick.

	Can’t say what will turn up.  Can see clearly consequences of clearing

		out.  Determinn to stay, because we are there as of right, until P.

		turn us out.



P.M.	But what hope of satisf. agreement with P. Govt?



D.	I can’t see any.



H.G.	Doesn’t it help P. if we stay &amp; help.



P.M.	What is likely to turn up.  Working arrangemt. with Govt?



D.	Growing pressure w’in that month.  And, if no solution, can at least

		protect staff in Abadan.

	Agreemt. is a possibility.

	Other is to stay, under protn, at Abadan &amp; offer to refine what they can

		to send down fr. the fields.

	Gradual evacn from fields is worst course.



E.Sh.	Influence of U.S. on P. Army.

D.	Don’t know:  doubtful.



E.Sh.	P. Army will try to protect B. staff?



D.	Yes.



E.Sh.	Receipts?



D.	I thght. tht., while Hague on, I shdn’t prejudice posn of CO.

		Shd I now offer to sign?  But they are now askg. for cash:  the

		month’s notice being now up.



H.G.	That wd. be surrender.  We can’t countenance P. Govt. getting money 

		direct.

	Don’t therefore bother to find another form of receipt.



D.	Wd like a public appeal to staff to stay for x weeks:  on behalf of 

		H.M.G. in hope tht. orderly arrangemt. may be made.



P.M.	Implies evacn at end of that time.



P.	Troops?



D.	Mixed effect.  Mauritius frightened some, but maddened others.



D.	*Plan for evacuation of Fields staff is thro’ Bandar Mashur.*



C.N.S.	Can see wtr. we can cover evacuation from there.



E.Sh.	You pressed Drake to say what wd. happen in a month.  What do you

		expect to come of it?



P.M.	A reasonable Govt., with wh. we cd. conclude a new agreement.



E.Sh.	When we ask what sort of agreement, you object it’s giving show 

		away.  How much are we prepd to give away?  We haven’t

		defined that.



H.M.	We put a clear-cut scheme to P. Govt.  We know where we stand.



E.Sh.	They wdn’t accept it, or negotiate.



P.M.	Our policy is to stand firm &amp; hope for a more reasonable P. Govt.



G.W.	That was Drake’s policy.



P.M.	Practical ques:  shd. we have any gradual w’drawal:  or all stand pat.

		We can’t guarantee their safety.  Shall we run the risk that 

		P. Army will protect them?



N.B.	D. also wants to know tht. if they stay for a month &amp; then things go 		worse we shall be able then to evacuate them. 



R.R.S.	Gradual evacn wd. be disastrous.  D. wd. be satisfied if Bandar Mashur

		cd. be covered in moment of evacuation.



H.G.	i)	Ask C.O.S. to consider wtr. they can cover Bandar Mashur.

	ii)	H.M. has said publicly staff will be w’drawn fr. fields as they

		become un-necessary.  Don’t want to show weakness by

		contradicting that publicly.  N.I.O.C. have told employees to 

	y/	stay a month.  Better let staff say in reply to that they will stay.



J.	ii) was O.K.  Their presence is now requd in the fields.  D. can say so.



McN.	P. Govt. will get to know.  Will they think it means we are weakening?

		We have assumed our sanctions.  Wd. be technique &amp; tonnage.  		(D. hopes for a mil. sanction).  We may lose our technical

		sanction by saying our staff will stay in the fields.

	I favour planned w’drawal.



H.M.	I like y/.  Cd carry approval of CO. &amp; even H.M.G.



McN.	P. Govt. wd. think it meant a change of view by H.M.G.



H.G.	It is for CO. to say tht. they are still required in the fields.



		Agreed:  (i) above re Bandar Mashur.

			     (ii) as at y/.  And see that A.E. is informed

			           so that he may not press for Govt. action.



Att.G.	Injunction likely to be obtained – not to do anything m’while to

		interrupt operations.  That wd. apply to us too.  Wd run in line

		with y/.

			     (iii) see that gradual w’drawal is stopped at once,

			            in advance of any statement.



	b)	C.O.S. Report.



C.N.S.	Some political consequences in mountg. this from Egypt.  Suez Canal

		rules re warships.  Also assembly of ships in Canal cd. raise

		diffies.

	We shd. start to-day.  Can’t be kept secret (L.S.T.).  Some statement

		wd. have to be made.



P.M.	Effect on opinion.



Att.G.	Hague Ct. wd. be less inclined to order in our favour if they thght. we

		were about to take law into own hands.





E.Sh.	Midget depends on no resistance by P. Army.

	If resistance, this larger opn wd. be necessary.

	How far cd. we go with this w’out any overt statement?



Att.G.	Interim decision by Hague Ct. will prob. be given in course of this

		week.



H.G.	CO. may be asked by Ct. wtr. they stand by terms of offer to P. Govt.

		at Tehran.  That assumed no interference.  Co. propose to say 

		they stand by offer:  but assumes status quo ante:  &amp; they wdn’t

		now pay the £12 m. until shipments fr. Abadan are resumed.

		This seems right.



J.	No mil. prepns involvg. announcemt. until Hague interim	Agreed.

		decn has bn. given.



C.I.G.S.	This is merely a proposal to prepare a Force for use in M/E.  

		Object = to occupy Abadan.  Don’t need, however, to use it for

		that.  If we don’t prepare it, you can’t have it later.



G.W.	Shd be ready to deal with a Tudeh coup.  But public statements mght. 

		have effects in Comm.  V. bad Can. Press throughout.  India etc.

		From my angle therefore I’m opposed to any immedte action

		involvg. publicity.



A.V.A.	As soon as you say you’re getting 10.000 men &amp; 2 reservists, 

		everyone will assume you are commd to the major operation.



McN.	Folly to risk any public knowledge of this now.

	Also, pol. considns shd. be considered first, incldg. our posn in U.N.

		U.N.	is the instrument by which U.S. gets done what we want to

		see done.



P.M.	Inadvisable (Hague Ct.) to take any overt action.  Planning can go on:

		But for next new days no overt action.



B.	Three ships in M/E. earmarked as troopers:  can’t stop them w’out

		publicity.



H.G.	Cd we have a report showg. what overt action wd. be needed &amp; when.

	Want to consider interference with cargo e.g. iron ore.



			Agreed:  (iv)  No overt action pro tem.  Examine details

			                       at Def. Cttee later in the week.



J.G.	Want opportunity to discuss politics of this.



J.S.	17.000 Z. reservists wd. have to be called up for this – to 1st &amp; 3rd

		Divns.  Method therefore, needs considn.



C.N.S.	Object was to enable us to do somethg.  Remember tht., if we don’t

		prepare this, &amp; somethg. happens in Persia, we can do nothing

		for 6 weeks.
