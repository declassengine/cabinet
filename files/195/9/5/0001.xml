C.M. 27(51).				12th April, 1951.



	1.	Korea.	[Enter  W.W., H.H.M.



H.M.	Statement in H/C. didn’t cover statement of aims.  Desirable to get

		revised version out quick.  Promised early announcement.  We

		have approached U.S. in pursuance Cab. decn.  U.S. Govt. 

		seemed friendly:  but now favour more limited p’mme because

		they expect Ch. offensive.  Also because re-actions to McA.’s 

		dismissal.

	I have urged it further on U.S. G. because I believe this is psych.

		moment.  Asked Fr. &amp; Comm. Govts. to support.

	Failing multi-lateral decln, may have to consider separate declns.

		Will report further on developmts.



A.	Don’t appear to be taking it out of U.N.



H.M.	Very well.



E.Sh.	Doubts now wtr. Ch. will start offensive.  May be merely replacg.

		tired troops, not adding any.

	Don’t press U.S. too hard when they are sore over MacA.



H.M.	Yes:  leave it to my discretion.



H.W.	Will new U.N. Commr. go on with fleet operation.



H.M.	Don’t know.  Wd be unwise to put the point to U.S., probably.



H.D.	Franks mght. have it in mind – if he gets a chance to put it.



J.G.	MacA. may appear before Congress.  Wd be convenient if decln were

		made first.



A.B.	Let it all rest:  mil. opns die away:  don’t provoke situation in wh. U.S.		can’t join in decln &amp; Ch. see us divided.



H.M.	Will guide my conduct in light of Cab.’s discussion.





	2.	Parliament.



C.E.	Business for next week.

	Tuesday:  Schools.  Scotland shd. be repd on bench.

	Thursday:  N.A.T. command organn until 7 p.m.

		Opposn now say interim W. Paper wd. be useful.

		Can be available Tuesday.

		M/D. thinks that Opposn shd. then open – his case is in W. Paper.



E.Sh.	On Med. command we now have disagreemt. among our C.O.S.

	But we can give full a/c of N.A.T. set-up &amp; justify U.S. Supr. Comm.

		for Atlantic.  Also somethg. re diffies of Med.

		Fairly long Wh. Paper.

	Believe pol. tension has relaxed.

	Will put draft to Def. Cttee Monday.  Present Tuesd. 5 p.m.

	Outlined situatn on Med.  I cdn’t agree to U.S. Commr. controllg.

		Br. bases in Med.		           [Enter  E.S.

				                   

C.E.	Propose to introduce Health &amp; N.I. insurance Bills on Tuesday.

		Legn Cttee Monday p.m..

	Second Rdg. followg. week.

	Finance Bill week after that.



A.B.	I can’t vote for Health Bill.



H.W.	Strong diff. of opinion on this ques.  We shd. take no open act until

		P.M. is back.  Introdn of legn shd. therefore be p’poned.



H.M.	Much discn &amp; worry over this.  Related to Budget.  Best Parly tactics

		wd. be to get on with it.  If it’s clear we are still arguing Parly

		diffies will be increased.  H.G. shd. not be left in doubt about 

		decn wh. he has announced.

	H.W.’s suggn implies diff. decn mght. be reached on substance after

		P.M. returns.

	Govt. credit pledged now H.G.’s statement made.

	Decn acceptable to substantial majority in Party mtg.



H.W.	Timing not substance.  Much feeling in Party.  Deferment wd. help.

	Don’t agree tht. substantial majority accept this.  Of those who spoke

		more were hostile than in favour.



E.Sh.	We were relieved to hear y’day no resignns.  Party were happy over

		that &amp; over receptn of Budget.  If we revive controversy, v.

		serious sitn.  Cab. reached decision:  held to it:  announced it 

		in H/C.  Legn embodies no more than those decisions.

		Suppose, as result of delay, there arises in Party due to 

		propaganda, a division of opinion:  we can’t survive that.

		If Cab. decided now to revise earlier decision, some of us mght.

		decline to support that view.  This is not one-way traffic.

		If Cab. decided now to revise earlier decision, some of us mght.

		decline to support that view.  This is not one-way traffic.

		If this goes on, we shall divide Cab. and Party.  Some of us 

		mght. resign because Cab. wanted to go back on a decision.

		Can’t we forget the past and go fwd. with decision announced.

	It’s for Cab. to decide and tell Party meeting.



		C.E.’s proposal approved ….. after 15 min. discn not heard.



				[Exit  H.H.M. &amp; E.S.

				[Enter  Wheatley

	3.	U.N. Covenant on Human Rights.



H.M.	I don’t know anything about this – except that we are in a mess.

	Started as anti-S. propaganda.  As it goes on, it looks as tho’ it will

		put us on the spot – esp. re Colonies.



J.	No use takg. narrow legal point of view.  Ques:  is it really important

		qua f. policy?

	Work of cranks.  Vague language – formulae by compromise.

		Hence obscurity of language out of place in a code.

	But, for f. policy reasons, we signed the C/Europe Convention.

		We decided we cdn’t put in reservations.  Thereafter, 3 Protocols.

		Elections not bad:  property (will put us in diffies over £300 m.

		c. &amp; betterment):  education very awkward here &amp; in 

		Colonies.

	If we signed this one, we cdn’t keep Tsekedi out of Bamangwato

		Reserve.  Nor deport stowaways – under fresh legislation.

		Art. 3:  effect on sentries.

	We have never before thus limited sovereignty of our Parliament.

	Tho’ I give way at once on all these points if F.O. say this is essential

		for f. policy.

	But if we go on, let’s look v. narrowly at every Article.



H.D.	On C/Europe Convention, have we not excluded jurisdn of court.



J.	Yes:  but we may be pressed to accept it later.



H.D.	In doing so, we made it clear we were satisfied with our law.



J.	On U.N. Covenant:  we have proposed some judicial power to

		pronounce wtr. our legn is satisfactory.  This therefore is much

		more dangerous than the C/Europe.



H.M.	I am sceptical of f. policy value.  Totalitarian states will ignore it

		anyway.  I wd. have preferred manifesto, vice covenant.  I wd.

		wish to play it slow:  get it so muddled tht. nothg. will happen.



H.D.	At least, take no fresh initiative.



J.G.	Col. appln clause is out now, by U.N. vote.  We couldn’t apply this

		Covenant in Colonies.

	Tho’ politically dangerous for us to w’draw.

	If we stay in, we mght. guide discn usefully.



J.	Stay in &amp; make difficulties.

	V. difficult for us to walk out.



A.B.	Existg. specialised agencies shd. handle those aspects of matter with

		wh. they are equipped to deal – if only “examine and report.”

		Wd delay:  and wd. inject an element of common sense.

G.W.	As it stands, w’out Col. appln clause, it is unacceptable to us.

		We shd. realise that.



J.	The 3 Protocols under C/E. Convention shd. come to Cabinet.



				[Exit  Wheatley



	4.	Bamangwato Tribe.



G.W.	I had hoped T. wd. regain his influence over tribe.  In fact, he is

		increasingly suspected.  If he returned, all progress twds.

		self-govt. wd. be wrecked.

	From public interest of B., he shd. be kept out.

	If he wd. play, I wd. protect his interests &amp; give him a job under

		ground nuts scheme.

	I want to exclude him – either with his agreemt. or w’out it.



J.	Needn’t put it to him as life sentence.



G.W.	Only for W. Paper period.  Re-affirm that.

	Some chance of amicable settlement.  And I wd. then be generous.

		But must know tht. we will go on with it by compulsion.



H.G.	Money mght. come elsewhere than fr. Exchequer.

		C.R.O., C.O. &amp; Ty. shd. consult on that.  C. Dev. &amp; W. Fund 

		mght. be used.



A.	Support G.W.’s plan.



H.M.	Awkward to spend public money on private man’s interests, to keep

		him quiet.



G.W.	Think we can do it with little U.K. money.  And we ought to open up

		this territory anyhow.



H.M.	Difference between policy on Basutoland &amp; Bechuanaland.  Is this

		right?  Will repve govt. suit Bechuanaland.



A.	Want local headmen to do more.



G.W.	Wdn’t have taken that line if it hadn’t bn. for Seretse.



H.M.	Go easy on repve councils.



G.W.	They wd. sooner have a chief.

	No statement unless he cuts up rough &amp; will go to Press himself.









	5.	Film of Berlin Youth Rally.



H.M.	Diff. to decide w’out seeing film.  Can arrange for Cab. to see it.

	Someone wanted to show it as indicatg. dragooning of youth.

	But I think impression will be opposite:  they look so happy.

	Powers of import licence are with B/trade.  I wd. like to see it kept

		out if we could.  Alternatively, we mght. “edit” it and use it.

	Drop the idea of using Prerogative.



H.W.	Edited version wd. help us.  But we can’t do that while it’s owned

		by others.

	Import licensing:  never used for pol. censorship.  Shdn’t start that

		now.  Nor cd. we use regn powers.

	B.B.F.C. cd. decline certificate.



H.M.	Ordinary cinemas wdn’t show this.



H.W.	Econ. controls shdn’t be used for censorship.  Trouble if we did.

                   x/	One of our film cos. mght. buy the rights &amp; edit it. 



C.E.	Have seen film.  It is good:  it is dangerous.

	Hope B/T. mght. arrange x/.

	No existg. powers shd. be used to prevent entry.



			Agreed:  Cabinet to see the film.     }

			               Prob. in H/C. in evening.  }





	6.	Stone of Scone.



C.E.	It is the Stone.  There was to have bn. big demonstration on its 

		removal from Forfar.  I defeated that, by surreptitious 

		removal – eventually to Ldn.





	7.	Procedure.



T.W.	May 7 is day after May Day.  Need we have Cab. on May 7.
