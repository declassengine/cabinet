C.M. 40(51).				5th June, 1951.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  W.W.



	Business for next week.





	2.	Schuman Treaty.



H.M.	On assumptn tht. Treaty comes into force, no need to m’tain Allied

		control.  Seems unnecessary to m’tain this control.   [Exit  W.W. 



H.G.	W. party rept. will be available soon.  But no need to discuss with

		Community until ratified – not likely before autumn.  Schuman

		hasn’t pressed his suggn for talks:  prob. courtesy only.  Enough

		to say we are studying text &amp; shall like to discuss with 

		Community in due course.



H.M.	Fr. my angle, G. co-opn will be easier:  they will be more ready to

		ratify:  if we declare we will relax Allied control if &amp; when

		Schuman Treaty comes into opn.  Contingent on ratification of

		Treaty.



H.McN.	If we start discns &amp; Treaty then fails it wd. be diff. to          [Enter  G.S.

		get back to Allied control.



A.V.A.	Earlier, we assumed full discn on Treaty because relns with Allied

		controls.



H.M.	That was discn wtr. we shd. be associated with Plan.

	My point here is:  I.A.R. is no use in practice.  If Treaty comes in, we

		can’t use other controls.  And they must go soon in any event.



P.M.	If Plan comes in, &amp; we don’t join it, we shd. lose all control.



G.W.	Ineffective if U.S. &amp; Fr. don’t want to use them.  Para. 3(iii).

		We couldn’t do anything.



G.S.	Worried because effect on our re-armament.  Wanted scrap or

		semis in return for removg. Allied controls.  Cdn’t get that.

		French got assurances re coal &amp; coke.

	We need scrap or semis fr. G. for defence (incldg. defence of G.).

		Despite agreement, they are exportg. steel to countries we usually

		supply.  No control over that.  Cd. we not, even at this stage, get

		some assurce tht. countries re-arming under N.A.T.O. shd. get

		some of the semis to result fr. G.’s increased prodn.  Under

		Schuman, no preference for defence purposes.  Abandon scrap:

		can’t do any more on that.



N.B.	On allocn of Europ. coal (O.E.E.C. &amp; E.C.E.) we believe it will be

		more diff. to meet needs of countries outside Schumania, 

		e.g. Austria, if I.A.R. is abolished.  On other hand, many of our

		objns to Plan have bn. met;  &amp; in long run it mght. bring us

		advantages.  We must be assocd with intern. machinery for coal.



E.Sh.	Mil. Security Bd. will continue to enforce control over end items.



G.S.	Yes:  in Germany.  But no control over exports of steel or semis.  We

		can’t control that.



H.M.	We can’t control it now.



T.W.	Why not continue to bargain until Treaty ratified in autumn.



H.D.	Why can’t we get a good deal out of this, as Fr. have done.  U.S. cd.

		be enlisted?



E.Sh.	G. producing 1½ . m. tons above limit.  Have we tried to buy surplus?



G.S.	Yes, but can’t get more than a small amount.  They prefer to sell to

		“normal” markets – incldg. Czechosl., Finland &amp; S. America.



P.M.	Our card may be weak.  But shd. we throw it away?

	If we surrender our posn in I.A.R., we have no control at all.



McN.	I.A.R. shd. have enforced decn tht. surplus prodn shd. go to N.A.T.

		defence.  French unwilling to make I.A.R. work because they 

		have met their needs by separate deal.  Para. 6.



G.S.	I advocate bi-lateral agreemt. as condn of our agreeing to aboln of 

		I.A.R.



H.G.	These are security controls.  Can we make econ. bargain in return

		for lifting them?  Did French do this?



G.S.	I believe they got guarantee re coke &amp; coal as condn of lifting restns

		on G. industry.



H.G.	Restoration of normal G/French trade.



G.S.	But they used a threat to get it.



P.M.	No gesture w’out compensation.



E.Sh.	G. steel to Czechosl. is a v. serious matter.



			Agreed:  F.O. to re-consider, with M/Supply.



J.G.   }	Shd. be considered concurrently with Schuman Treaty.

         }

N.B. }	No concln in advance of that.



P.M.	Bring it up again next week.

				[Exit  N.B. &amp; G.S.

				[Enter  E.D.

	3.	Four Power Talks.



H.M.	N.A.T. point was introduced at relatively late stage in discussions.

	We resisted it – in notes to Moscow.

	We can’t give way.  U.S. won’t.  French might because elections.

	i)	R. trying to build agenda suggesting W. Powers are aggressors.

	ii)	N.A.T:  12 Power.  Others have interest.

	iii)	N.A.T. resulted fr. R. threats not vice versa.

	iv)	If N.A.T. discussed, Cominform must too – useless &amp;

		       lengthy.

	Conclude:  R. don’t genuinely want a mtg.

	We can be misrepresented.  cf. Manchr. Guardian.  Inclined to think

		it best to return argumentative reply, keep it going for a few days.

		R. can break confce by adding unwelcome items &amp; makg. it 

		appear we are breakg. it.

	Climb down wd. be humiliation w’out advancg. cause of peace.



E.D.	This R. note = def. rejn of ours.  Won’t meet unless N.A.T. on agenda

		as non-agreed item.

	Simple, were it not for Fr. electns.  Because of those, we ought prs. to

		continue discns of offls. – at least not break them off.

		i)	Direct reply to Moscow, repeatg. earlier note.

		ii)	Ditto via Gromyko.

		iii)	Say it verbally in Paris.

	i) wd. look as tho’ we were brkg. Conference.

	ii) destroys purpose of original note.  Paris wd. be useless.

	iii) is best.  We can make it clear we want a mtg. on agreed items, &amp;

		put blame on R. for insistg. on N.A.T.

	Clear tht. purpose of discussg. N.A.T. wd. be to undermine defence 

		of West.  Can’t therefore give in.  But make our posn clear

		verbally in Paris.  Suspend mtg. thereafter.

	Fear French will prefer to delay reply until after Elections.



H.D.	We must help French.  17/6 is not far off.  This need not be the end.

		Moscow note is v. skilful.  We must try to be clever too.  Go

		on talkg. in Paris – at least until after Fr. elections.



R.R.S.	Can’t we throw ours back on R.  Say we are ready to discuss all things

		each side is doing to aid mutual defence – then we get even.



E.Sh.	Armaments will be discussed under other items.

	I don’t mind discussg. N.A.T. if we can discuss R.’s correspondg.

	arrangemts.



J.G.	What about effect on U.K. public opinion of R. note?  Second para.

		puts us in diffy.  N.A.T. only as unagreed item.  Puts on us

		onus of brkg. off &amp; abandoning mtg.  Tension, eased by talks,

		will be renewed.  Putting N.A.T. outside field of negotiation

		will look pretty bad.



A.V.A.	Greatest factor in Fr. elections will be this R. note.

	Will iii) in E.D. satisfy Fr. opinion on that?

	Clear that U.K. opinion is disturbed.

	Wd. it not be wiser to publish a considered written reply?



H.S.	Grave effect of interruptg. Deputies mtg.

	To refuse a non-agreed item means tht. one F. Minister is precluded

		from raising ques. wh. he considers of gt. importance.

	Better talk, even for months, than have war.

	Agreed item already wh. wd. allow some talk of R. arms.

	Counter this by adding un-agreed item on Satellite arms.

	And go on talking in Paris.



McN.	Refusal wd. also put us on defensive re N.A.T.

	I agree with H.S.  Find an embarrassing counter-item to put fwd.

		E.g. Yugoslavia:  mght. be better than Satellite arms.



J.	Agree. We must meet – on best terms we can get.

	What objn to acceptg. this as un-agreed item.  Will be thought we are

		avoidg. discn because we have somethg. to hide.  We shd. be in

		wrong.

	Must, however, get U.S. &amp; Fr. agreemt. to that course.



T.W.	We must counter x/ in Note viz., tht. N.A.T. is cause of tension.

	Spin out talks until after Fr. elections.



P.M.	“Consequences of R. armament:  a) N.A.T.”  Add that to agenda.



H.M.	All these views contradict last Cab. decision.

	I dislike i)  acceptg. agenda putting us on defensive.

		     ii) I am not willing to talk for months in W’ton.



E.D.	N.A.T. can be discussed under Item 1. – causes &amp; effects of tension.

		But as separate item it suggests C.F.M. has power to decide 

		re N.A.T.



E.Sh.	We can’t afford to fight.  H.M. therefore can’t afford not to talk.



H.G.	With N.A.T. as un-agreed item, R. can deploy all their arguments

		v. N.A.T. in discussing ques. wtr. it shd. be added to agenda.



E.D.	French &amp; U.S. are both quite unwilling to have this added as unagreed.



McN.	We shall find ourselves discussg. this at every successive internl mtg.

	Point tht. this is beyond scope of C.F.M. is met by having it un-agreed.

H.S.	We must keep these talks going.  Keep a C.F.M. ahead of us, always.	That was view of Fr. Ambassador.



H.M.	I won’t waste months of valuable time.

	Ready to consider adding counter-item re Cominform, Satellites etc.

	If R. refuses that, break will be their responsibility:  or we shd. have to

		discuss both.



P.M.	We shan’t be able to prevent them fr. talking about N.A.T. under

		item 1.



G.W.	Then why do they insist on separate item.



H.G.	Their note – v. useful propaganda.



A.V.A.	Have we got across to public reasons for not agreeing to discuss

		N.A.T.



P.M.	Argumentative reply, countering x/ (para 3).



E.D.	Then we stand on our note, and Dpties. don’t meet

		again unless R. agrees to restricted agenda.



H.S.	Why don’t we counter attack. V. well:  if you want to discuss N.A.T.

		We’ll agree if you’ll discuss Satellite arms etc.



E.D.	We must adhere to our view tht. N.A.T. can’t go on.  We can’t give

		way on that.



H.M.	Not sure.  Cd. leave door open to agreeing later.



McN.	What about y/.  I think Deputies should resume.



			Agreed:  H.M. to draft argumentative reply, consult

			               P.M. and if necessary Cabinet.

				[Exit  E.D.     C.E.

				[Enter  L.O.’s.

	4.	N.A.T. Privileges.



H.M.	My sympathy is with the critics.

	And F.O. tried hard to get the lower scale.



P.M.	Views of Home Secy.



H.M.	I agree – grin and bear it.



J.	Dislike this.  F.O. weren’t stiff enough in early stages.

		Must accept para. 10.  Parlt. won’t like it.

	But, in view of importance of N.A.T.O., we must swallow this.



H.G.	Agree in general.  But no announcemt. tht. we will pay compensn.

		[No earlier case.]

			Memo. approved.



				[Enter  M.W., H.A.M.

	5.	Resale Price Maintenance.



H.S.	This is what Cab. wanted, but I have little enthusiasm for it.

	At moment, when redn of supplies, won’t affect c/living.

	Nor is it popular election cry.

	I wd. have preferred to a) strengthen Monopolies Commn.

			                   b) collective price m’tenance etc., etc.

	Anti-boycott legn wd. have bn. better.  Cd. enlist more support.

		Case for this will be economic &amp; doctrinaire.

	Enforcemt. of anti-b. wd. be easier.  Legn wd. be simpler.

	Go on with this:  but don’t blow it up.

	Decisions needed on ques. in para. 19.

	Finally, none of this can apply when manufr. retails his own goods.



Att.G.	How enforce these provisions v. collective arrangemts.

	i)	Monopolies Act ’48.  S.11.  Failure to comply with order is

		not criminal offence.

		Why change over now to criminal remedy.

	ii)	Will it be possible to prove an offence?  Must have evce tht. 

		someone is operating the plan.  More diff. in criminal than 			in civil procdgs.

	In paras. 34 &amp; 40 cd. we say “illegal” vice “an offence”;  &amp; give us

		more time to consider.  Civil procdgs, at my instance, seem more

		probable.

		Result:  an injunction:  may not be enough.  Damages won’t do,

		for not enough to expect private individual to take procdgs.



H.D.	Delay due to H.W.

	Draft W. Paper is good – don’t alter it.

	This is valuable, tho’ not epoch-making.  Don’t let’s do less than this.

		Add anti-boycott, or collective v. p.m., if you like.

	Admirable report with memo. of 1/2.

	Believe this will be popular at Election, if well presented.

		Co-ops. are behind it.  Even Tories are keen on it.  Danger of

		getting agreed measure – a deplorable result.



Wh.	Is this Election manifesto – or somethg. you can enforce?

		Enforcement does need more thght.  Cr. procdgs. are 

		better deterrent.  Not impossible to get evidence.





			{  …………..Memo. approved.

			{  In debate, H.S. can say he is considering other measures

			{  e.g. anti-boycott &amp; strengthening Monopolies Commn

			{  Act.  Intend to legislate, but give no date.

	6.	Equal Pay.



	M/L. memo. approved.
