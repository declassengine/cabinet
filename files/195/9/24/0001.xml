C.M. 46(51).				25th June, 1951.



	1.	Persia.	[Enter  C.O.S., N.B.



H.M.	Bill introduced into Majlis trial by mil. courts &amp; penalties

		incldg. death for actions imperilling oil supplies.  Drake has

		bn. informed tht. he is guilty of sabotage because oil receipts.

		x/ Cons. Genl. authd to tell him to sign on demand, if charge of

		sabotage w’drawn.

	Tankers – one has cut &amp; run:  others held up.  Form of receipt.  

		Masters authd to sign subject to addn of words saving rights of

		A.I.O.C.

	Tehr. Tel. 705 of 23/6:  conciliatory message fr. P. Govt.

	Action  a) release of tankers  b) threat of Bill to Co. employees.

		If a) can’t be solved on basis of receipts, they will have to unload

		and go.  If detained empty, naval action.

		On b) we mght. send a note denying B. respons. in advance for

		“sabotage”.  We mght. urge them to stay at posts, assurg. them of

		protn (if we can).

	Persia group mtg. this p.m. – memo. on econ. sanctions.

                    y/	Shd. we warn P. Govt. more firmly?

	Co. men in fields:  Co. authd to w’draw them to Abadan.



H.G.	Meaning of x/. ?



H.M.	Documents concerned are said to relate to tanker receipts.



McN.	What other documents?



E.Sh.	Tel. 681 – inviting him to serve with new Co.?



C.N.S.	Imposs. to guarantee safety of staff.

	Believe tankers are sailing.

	We shd. tell S.N.O., Gulf, what to do if P. Govt. try to intercept

		tanker wh. is movg. down river.  We shd. intervene because in

		Iraqi waters.

	1 cruiser &amp; 1 frigate at Kweit?  Cruiser 12 hrs. fr. Abadan, but depends

		on tides.  Frigate at Basra is closer:  20 miles up river fr. 

		Abadan.



H.M.	R.N. shd. show itself now.



P.M.	Yes.



C.N.S.	Co. don’t want ships at A.  But we shd. instruct S.N.O. to free any

		tanker detained going down river.



E.Sh.	We shd. give the warning at y/:  won’t tolerate interf. with B. people

		&amp; shall hold them responsible etc.  Do that first and at once.



McN.	What is our policy on tankers?  To get them out?  If so, make that

		clear to P. Govt.



P.M.	No new tanker shd. go in.



C.N.S.	They are putting them in, 1 for 1, to go on moving oil.



E.Sh.	What advantage to P. to seize tankers:  they can’t use them.



A.V.A.	Mght. pinch them, as demonstration.



P.M.	Remove the tankers – shd. be our policy.



N.B.	If we were satisf. P. wd. seize them.



H.G.	That moment has come.  We agreed with Fraser tht. he wd. w’draw

		tankers if receipts were insisted upon.



P.M.	I think we shd. now w’draw all Co. tankers &amp; send no more in.



H.G.	And Co. can arrange with other Cos. to do ditto with their tankers.



C.N.S.	Only 9 at a time are in jeopardy.  P. have yielded twice – once on 

		receipts, once on interference with a tanker.  I don’t think P. will

		act re tankers.  If we stop them, refinery will be out in 2 wks,

		fields will stop – disorder will start.



E.Sh.	All turns on wtr. our people are to stay (even workg. for Persian Co.)

		or come out.  Evacn = surrender.  Nor can we get them back.



P.M.	Needn’t bring them to U.K.  Collect them e.g. at Basra.



H.D.	Our duty to them, on this Bill, is to bring them into Abadan.



G.W.	Bill is new danger.



E.Sh.	Not important cpd. risk of rioting.  And that increased by stoppage of 

		oil fields.



H.G.	Our policy is to get P. into posn of gettg. themselves in a mess.

	Not easy to decide exact moment to w’draw tankers.  Object:  w’draw

		them when we can’t get any oil out.  May be nec. to w’draw them

		a bit earlier for fear of their being seized.

	W’drawal of people.  Must leave it to Co. to decide when to pull them

		in to A.  Don’t give over-riding order.  Co. cd. go on paying their

		salaries:  needn’t be dispersed.



J.	Yes.  Subject to this.  If fires etc., in fields, we must have it clear it’s

		P. responsibility not ours.  Not so clear if our people still there.



G.W.	India has urged on P. Govt. need for peaceful settlement.  Corrects

		Nehru’s speech.



C.N.S.	Rioting is real danger - &amp; wd. be enhanced by closing fields.



		(1)	Agreed:  Send note as at y/ - adding our people remain to

			               to protect safety of installations.



N.B.	Consider v. carefully the moment at wh. we put P. into a mess.

		For that will provoke the dis-orders.



A.V.A.	Tel. recd 21/6. from Cons. Genl. saying P. interference seems 

		imminent.

	Serious for us to disregard this warning.    



H.G.	Have we, as Govt., make our posn clear on receipts?



H.M.	I don’t know.



R.R.S.	At what stage do we protect the people who are protectg. the plant?



C.I.G.S.	Midget takes 36 hrs. to reach only Abadan.



R.R.S.	Can we defend them, while protectg. plant.



C.I.G.S.	No.  Troops wd. hold small area for short time while people there

		are being evacuated.  More wd. mean larger opn, 6 wks. to mount.



A.R.	Message recd at Geneva  i) workers opposed to natn  ii) believed 

		inspired by U.S.  iii) sitn wd. be exploited by Comms.  

		iv) P. employees of Co. wd. rally to initiative by H.M.G. – but

		not otherwise.  v) respect for Shah mght. be exploited:  if he wd.

		clear out this Govt., no diffy in concldg. reasonable agreemt.

		vi) failure of oil wd. mean revolution.  vii) H.M.G. shd. have

		handled this P. Govt. more firmly.

	This from a P. Labour leader – who made a speech saying poverty etc.

		in P. was due to P. Govt. not H.M.G.



		(2)	Agreed:  Persia Group to consider.		[Exit  E.Sh.

			               Avoid Parly statement to-day.



C.I.G.S.	The 36 hrs. for Midget cd. be shortened, by alerting troops in Egypt.



P.M.	Effect on P. opinion?



G.W. &amp; others:  Probably good. 



H.D.	Effect in U.K. wd. be good.   And 36 hrs. diff. to defend.



C.I.G.S.	Tell them to “stand-by” &amp; period can be reduced.

McN.	Need for preparatory publicity in U.S.  Trouble over alertg. 

		paratroops.



H.D.	Meet that by telling U.S. in advance.



		(3)	Agreed:  Stand-by the Midget troops.



C.I.G.S.	Cd I send them to Shaiba.  Iraq has agreed “for humanity”.



H.M.	Iraq Govt. are worried.



C.I.G.S.	They wdn’t do anything.  We cd. tell Iraq they won’t be sent in 

		except for “humanitarian reasons”.



H.G.	Careful of such promises to Iraq.  We mght. have to use them to hold

		Abadan island.



		(4)	Agreed.   P.M., with H.M. &amp; E.Sh. authorised to take

			                further action beyond (3) in emergency.



					[Exit  C.O.S.



	2.	Korea:  Soviet Suggestion for Truce.



H.M.	Read Malik’s message.

	Rumours for some time tht. R. wants this stopped because Ch. pressing

		for equipmt.

	Sent message to W’ton – don’t reject because may be sincere:

		U.S./U.K. repves together to draw Malik out.

	Cease-fire wd. be O.K.  But may be pre-condns re Formosa, seating

		China.

	P.N.Q. to-day:   Read draft answer.  “Unqualified optimism wd. be

		unwise:  but studying means of following up M’s offer.”



P.M.	Add somethg. to effect tht. this is precisely what Good Offices Cttee 

		have bn. trying to do.  Not a new idea of Malik’s.



McN.	Suspicious initiative.  Deprecate doing it by b’cast.



H.D.	Don’t niggle.

	Draft already too long.



P.M.	Welcome R. coming into line with others – what we hope may be an 

		indication tht ….





	3.	Supplementary Pensions for Miners.		[Enter  E.S.



	Much opposition, on all hands, to N.B.’s proposal.

		Not to be done under N.I. Act.  Nor by special legn.

				[Exit  N.B., E.S.

				[Enter W.W. &amp; 2 L.O.’s

	4.	Tshekedi Khama.



G.W.	Reaction of S. Africa:  revised view after consultn with S. Afr.

		H. Commr.

	J.G. has suggd sending 2 M.P.’s out, as for Sarawak.  Don’t like that:

		for I’ve recently bn. out myself.



P.M.	G.W. has v. strong case.  Wd weaken us, in H/C. &amp; in Africa, if we

		reversed our policy.  We must be firm.  Even Aristides was

		exiled.

		Views of tribe &amp; neighbours.

	Avoid Party points.  This may be a manoeuvre by W.S.C. – many 

		Tories may not then vote for Motion.



J.G.	We don’t want a division – because repercussions in Africa if only

		small majority.  (If we used S. African argument, our Party wd.

		vote solidly v. us.)

	i)  Repeated suggn re Sarawak.



P.M.	Impossible on this occasion, in view of G.W.’s recent visit.



J.G.	ii)  Powers of deportn w’out trial.  Have considered this in C.O., and

		want to discuss with Govrs. wtr. we can’t dispense with them.



G.W.	Glad to say tht. this posn can be considered in any Territories as in

		Colonies.



P.M.	V. different with Chiefs.  Cdn’t have judicial trial for them.



J.G.	Gold Coast leader disposed to summon All-Africa Confce to consider

		policy of S. African Govt.  Have tried to dissuade him.



P.M.	S.A. Govt. aren’t concerned over Tshekedi – only over Seretse.



G.W.	Not ques. of placating Malan:  it’s a ques. of retaining our control of 

		the H. Commn territories.

	Tribe wants S. in and T. out.  If we go against their wishes on both,

		there will be v. real trouble.



J.G.	C.O. are v. apprehensive about a division with  a small majority –

		indicatg. divided opinion in U.K.  They therefore urge some 

		form of enquiry, to avoid a division.



P.M.	Can’t avoid that risk.  Mght. have a motion at any time on

		straight C.O. issue, and we cdn’t hope for bigger majority

		than 6.



G.W.	One possibility:  ready to rest on native law &amp; custom and have it put

		once more to a “Kotla”.



P.M.	Cd you send 2 M.P.’s out as observers to the Kotla.



H.M.	I’m for standing firm – on T. alone.  Give P.M. &amp; G.W. discretion to

		make a concession if it doesn’t look weak.



P.M.	Or even 3 M.P.’s – one from each Party.



			Agreed:   Above concession authorised to be made.

			                P.M. and G.W. to speak in debate.





	5.	Divorce:  Royal Commission.



P.M.	Put the point in brief re happy married life.  Shd. be related to changes

		in the law.



H.G.	The phrase is comic also.  Need it be included at all.

                    x/	“Having in mind the need to promote ……… to consider wtr. any 

		changes be made in the law……?

	Tho’ I wd. prefer to omit.



C.E.	Then it will seem tht. Commn is to consider only “easier divorce.”



			Agreed, subject to x/.

				Exit  2 L.O.’s &amp; W.W.

  

	6.	Four Power Meeting.



H.M.	Have discussed with P.M. &amp; I will alter the draft.
