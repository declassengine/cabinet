C.M. 57 (51)					1st August, 1951



1.	     Secretary of Cabinet.



P.M.	Thanked N.B.





2.	Parliament.

					     [W.W. in &amp; out

	Dates of Summer Recess.





3.	Fruit &amp; Vegetables.

				         [Enter M.W.

H.D.	Ask only for approval in principle.



H.G.	Keep open wtr. it’s a public company or not.



A.V.A.	No consultn with distributors?



M.W.	Only with growers – distribution now, after settled in principle.



H.G.	Must do something.  Don’t be commd on detail.

	Announcement – what will it cover?



H.S.	Capital of Co.



T.W.	5 centres wd. cost £11/4m – capital.  But no need to start with 5.





4.	     Egypt.

					[Exit M.W.



H.M.	Progress report.  I’ve bn. playing it slow.  Want to get away from phased w’drawal startg. in a year.

	Danger – break by E. Foreign Minister.  P.M. &amp; King are trying to restrain him.  Strong stand over Emp. Roach has done good.



P.M.              |	Want memo. summing up factors (of strength) if we had a row.

                    x|		With Ty &amp; M/D &amp; econ. Dpts.



A.V.A.	i) No recent apprecn from Sudan itself.  Cd. we get one?



P.M.	Pro-Egypt Party of rich: but masses hate Egyptians.



H.G.	They don’t like E:  but may climb in on their side if they seem to be winning.



McN.	Stevenson says E. Party has lost ground recently.



A.V.A.	ii) What is U.S. attitude now?  In view of M/E. Bd. etc.



H.M.	They are “peace &amp; quiet” over E.  Drawg. them in to M/E. for their own educn.

	Wd. like to settle E. ques.  Wonder wtr., with new M/E Bd., I cd. get E. to move over to new idea of partnership (equal) vice occupn.



P.M.	That was E.S.’s line.



G.W.	U.S. don’t want M/E. H.Q. in Egypt.  Fight them on that.





5.	     Japanese Ship-building.

					[Enter B. &amp; P.

H.M.	Recognised diffy of writing this into Treaty.

	Don’t wholly accept figures given.  Propose to follow this up with U.S. &amp; getting A. &amp; N.Z. to join with us – as a matter for restn outside the Treaty.



P.	No naval objn.  But econ., build-up is greater than is needed.

		Support memo.



B.	145.000 gross t. until 1927.  Then 400.000t.  Gave fleet of 5m tons.

	Support memo.  Capacity is more than enough.



B.E.	On Appropn Bill y’day Ellis Smith raised ques. of J. competn.  Echo-ed by our supporters on all trades, incldg. ship-bldg.  Most of them were Left Wing.  Evident there’s misgiving in Party about Treaty.  I promised to draw H.M.’s attn to debate.

	Feeling less now because ship-bldg. have full order books for 3 yrs.  But fear for future there.



McN.	Tho’ speakers were left, speeches evoked more genl. sympathy.

	Thought Allison was expert.  How came he to put these figures.

A. &amp; N.Z. views based on security not competn.

	What sanction for restn outside Treaty?



H.M.	Can only try to get U.S./U.K. pressure on J. for voluntary limitn of their ship-bldg.



McN.	Not optimistic of U.S. co-opn on this.



H.M.	I expld this Treaty to a full House – and it went over pretty well.



J.G.	Where is J. to find outlet for her popn?  That pressure will mean vol. agreemt. will break down.  We can’t w’stand J. competn.



H.M.	What wd. you do?  Popn of 80m, rising at 1m a year:  they must live:  if you impose econ. condns you drive them into Communism.



H.S.	W’spread anxiety re  J. (and G.) competn.  Not limited to ship-bldg.

		But industry has no idea of countering that by the Treaty.



			           		[Exit B.

6.	     Libya.



H.M.	As in memo.

	Pol. posn not wholly satisfactory, in U.N. &amp; outside.  But may be possible to get this Treaty.



P.M.	Wanted bases in Cyrenaica.  Now asked to under-write state of Libya.

		Goes beyond C.  And may be a big financial commitmt.



H.G.	Details still outstanding.  Suggd ceiling of £1-11/2 m.  Worth while for strategic gain &amp; gettg. them in sterling area.



P.M.	But demands for higher living standards will come along - &amp; we’ll be under pressure that will be applied to us.



H.M.	Cd. U.S. contribute?



H.G.	Needs some thought.



P.M.	“a U.K. monopoly for the support of Libyan Budget”!!  Para. 6.



G.W.		i) Wording shd. make it clear tht. Comm Forces are included in “British”.

                       x|		ii) Treaty will come to U.N. Assembly.  Shd. now tell new Doms as well as old – restricted to what is comg. up in U.N.



P.	Support i).

	Duration of Treaty – C.O.S. views shd. be taken into a/c.



			Memo approved.





7.	     Future of British Council.



H.M.	Expre has bn. trimmed.  Now not unreasonable.

	Can we regard it as permanent body – subject to 10yrs. review.

	Para 3(2) – as in memo.

	Para 3(3) – some financial stability over a period.  They suggest £3m – prob. too big.  But in principle some stability is desirable.

	Have sought to protect in principle Ty. interests &amp; rights.



P.M.	Have Doms. done anything to support them.  Shd. we pay for it all?



G.W.	In Doms. we are presentg. U.K. way of life.

	Canada thinkg. of somethg. similar – but they wd. present Canadian way of life.

	In old Doms. it is really anti-U.S. work.

	In all old Doms. now save S. Africa.



J.G.	Support in principle.  In colonies they do valuable work.



H.G.	Agree Council shd. go on.  Can in talking about permanence.

	Accept 3(2).

	Finance.  Ready to discuss.  But if any firm commitment it cd. cover only small part of total expendre.  £3m is larger than total grant for this year.  Much smaller “basic” figure.

	They look for establmt &amp; pensions for staff – doubtful about that.

	H.Q. staff shd. be vigorously primed.



H.McN.	Against this.  It’s sensible activities cd. be done by Universities.

	Nonsense to pretend 3(2) deceives anyone.

	If permanent, bring it into direct Govt. control.





8.	     Project for a New Hotel.

					       [Enter A.					           [G. Brown

P.M.	Much p’ers made &amp; money spent by Hylton (£50.000)

	Diffies over steel – some over labour.  Public doubts about doing it now – psychological – luxury hotel.  Esp. if dollar implicns aren’t understood.

	Cd. they import their own steel?  Outside allocns.



H.S.	Dollar shortage.  Lack of 1st class hotel has limited U.S. tourists.

		This wd. earn £1m p.a. in dollars.

		E.C.A. support it.  Embassy will press it.  They have bn. led to expect they cd. go on – tho’ in form bldg. licence was not promised.  Assured by offls. no labour or materials diffes save on steel.

	If they were to have bn. put off, shd. have bn. done 6 mos. ago.



A.R.	In S/E. England short of labour.  Can’t get spare Ldn. men out into it.



G.B.	I was asked y’day to get H/Q. Bldg. Cttee to cut projects out of appd p’mme. because steel shortage.

	Labour:   gt. shortages in E. Region.  Bringing starting date procedure back.  Reducg. Ldn. p’mme by £1m p. m.  To put in £2 m project, it will undo all this.  Vacancies: 250 for defence &amp; 500 for new towns in E. Region:  can only be met from Ldn.  Can’t begin this w’in next year or so.

	Dpts. are mis-using sponsorship.  New project by Llyod’s authd by B/T. costing £3.  Want to discuss how Dpts. are moving their allocations for sponsoring big projects.



H.S.	Lloyds was old commitmt, well known to Cap. Inv. Cttee.

	And Hilton project was mentioned by me in Prodn Cttee.

	Only 1/2m this year, 1m in ’52.



P.M.          x|	Explain to Hiltons it’s because of Defence p’mme.



H.D.	Yes.  We can’t let this go on.  Gt. shortage of structural steel.

		Housing &amp; defence projects being delayed.



J.	If dollar problem is to be crucial, this is most certain dollar earner.

	Shd. we not explain that?  Deserves a v. high priority.

	We haven’t had as many U.S. visitors this (Festival) year as last.

	Get the steel from U.S. &amp; go ahead.



P.M.	But labour posn is, apparently, equally serious.  Repeat x/.



H.S.	If it were a dollar-earning factory, labour wd. have bn. found.



G.B.	We shall now have to retard factory projects.



H.S.	Not dollar-earning projects.



A.R.	You will have to decide which defence or housing project shall be held back.



McN.	Take a chance on basis of U.S. steel.  Paper estimates on bldg. work aren’t 100% reliable.



H.M.	Don’t let defence blind us to need for earning our living.

	Have pressed for years for more good hotel accommodn.

	Take McN.’s course.



T.W.	I agree.  If this is right, let’s do it – despite pol. diffies.



H.G.	P’mme is overloaded.  If this were pure dollar-earner, it wd. qualify.

	But it won’t be wholly a net addition to dollar-earning.

	Not quite same as dollar-earning factory.

	Ty. advice is £1m vice is more likely revenue.

	All in all, incldg. pol. reaction, I favour x/.  Play for a p’ponement.  Try out their views on importing steel.



J.	Don’t upset Hilton group.



A.	Put if off – play for delay.

			                                             [Enter Sol. Genl., N.B., Bowker



9.	     Persia.



H.M.	U.S. Amb. has called &amp; is waiting.  H. has sent drafts of messages from U.K. Govt. &amp; reply from Persians.



P.M.	No mention of Abadan.  “atmosphere of friendliness” doesn’t cover it.

		We can’t defend that to U.K. public opinion.



H.M.	H. knew our view on that.  And this is evidently the best he can get.

		Hope tht. posn in South wd. improve, if R.R.S. went.

		If we don’t accept this, what happens next?



R.R.S.	This reply may not be as bad as P.M. suggests.

	M. wd. be bumped off if he admitted tht. things had bn. wrongly done in the south.

	“Both Govts. creating friendly atmosphere” implies action by P. Govt.

	H. thinks any further argument over draft will prejudice negotns.



H.G.	We are in a spot.  Accept P.M. fears.  But what can we do?

		If we cd. make it plain tht. this formula was proposed to us by H., it wd. help to spike Opposn guns.



H.M.	We must take responsibility for our own Notes.



R.R.S.	Cd. we state to H. tht. we understand he has made clear to P. Govt.

                     y|		tht. “creatg. etc” means relieving tension in South.



N.B.	Phrase can be taken to refer to South.  And we cd. publish y/ if the worst came.



McN.	P. are realising they can’t sell the oil.  This is only sanction.  It’s that, not H. tht. has brght. them round.  Wd. they come round still further if we hang back for another 24 hrs.  It’s they who are on the move.



P.M.	Failure of H. mission mght. bring M. down.

	No good crawling to M. if he can’t deliver the goods.



H.G.	But what will U.S. say if H. fails?



G.W.	World opinion turning against us.



A.R.	Get talking.  Let it be clear tht. it’s M. who’s responsible for a break.



J.G.	I agree.



P.M.	Cd. we make Press realise tht. behind this is acceptance of our condns.



H.M.	May get somethg. of that across.

	Can’t put it before H/C. rises because messages have to be exchanged.



A.	I agree with H.M.

			                         		                [Exit A.

H.S. &amp; J.	also agreed – because world public opinion.



			Agreed:  accept the proposed exchange of notes.

Bowker	Tel. 925.  “Formula”



R.R.S.	But also 926.



P.M.	No diffy. in accepting that formula.



H.M.	Persuade H. to get this quoted in Br. Note &amp; a reference to earlier natn law.



 		Agreed.



H.G.	i) Payment of £1m.  Sol. Genl. disagreed with Co.’s lawyers.  I thght. it must be paid.  Co. have £3m in a Persian bank.  But that wd. have whetted P. appetite for the other £2m.!  So I advised Co. to pay the £1m in ordinary course.  Said, if nec., we wd. indemnify them.  They have paid.

				            [Exit Bowker

			

	ii) Control of balances.  I am still stalling.  Until we see wtr. they misbehave.

	iii) Levy’s idea tht. P. will never accept A.I.O.C. as operating co. in Persia tho’ they may market ¾ of oil.  Idea of mixed Co., incldg. U.S.  We need not lose money by such a plan, so long as good arrangemt. made for division of profits.  Don’t therefore reject it out of hand.



H.M.	Critics will say – this lets U.S. in.  But there may be advantage in that.



P.M.	Bring in India &amp; Pakistan, perhaps, or Turkey.



R.R.S.	Co. are now prepared for that.



N.B.	Must retain B. control over Abadan.



R.R.S.	i) P.M.’s speech which contemplated partnership in wh. Persians “manage” the operations &amp; plant in interests of all.

	I thght it was our settled policy tht. operation shd. be under our control.



P.M.	I was speakg. w’out notes.



H.S.	v) Exports.  Embargoes to be raised if R.R.S. goes.  The rails (2 ships) reach Basra on 4/8.  Also export licences will reach a critical point in a few days.



R.R.S.	Mistake to stop anything now.



H.S.	Let the 2 cargoes go fr. Basra.

		If R.R.S. has gone by Fri. pm. – deliver.  If he hasn’t, hold it.



R.R.S.	 H. understands the whole thing may break down.  But he believes that may change Govt.  And he’s ready to go – with that in view.





	(resumed) British Council.

				                                                          [Exit R.R.S., &amp; H.M.

						N.B. Solr Genl.

P.	C.O.S. regard Council as v. valuable.



G.T.	I’ve changed my view on closer acquaintance.

	Venezuela – watch that.



H.G.	No announcement?  For I don’t like “indefinite.”



G.W.	Might have to answer a P.Q.



McN.	If no announcement, I w’draw my opposn.





10.	     Report of Broadcasting Committee.



P.M.	What hurry?



G.W.	Charter etc., has to be law by 31/12.  Much drafting to be done.

		G.P.O. want to go ahead.



P.M.	They won’t do much in Aug/Sept.

	If they must, let them work on alternative bases.  The points in dispute are small, in relation to all the rest.
