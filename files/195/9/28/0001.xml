C.M. 51 (51)					12th July, 1951



1.	     Parliament.

					         [Enter W.W.

C.E.	Business for next week.

	Debate on Persia. (Tuesday).  P.M. and H.M. (latter opening).  Might have to be p’poned, if situation so requires, in agreemt. with Opposition.

	In following week. suggn of economic debate.  23-25th July:  Mon. Supply formal + F.A. debate.  Tues.  F.A. again.  Wed. Econ. debate – all on adjournment. Alternatively, 3 days on combined F.A. &amp; Economic – for discussion.



P.M.	Letter from H.G.  Econ. ques. will crop up on first 2 days – embarrassing to wait until 3rd day.  He therefore prefers one debate.



H.D.	Timing with N. Ex. Mtg.  H.G. shd. speak on 2nd day.



P.M.	H.M. on 1st day:  H.G. on 2nd day:  P.M. on 3rd – in comprehensive debate.

		Whips to seek agreemt. of Opposn to this time-table.



				               [Exit W.W.



2.	     Persia.

			                                                     [Enter E.E.B., Att.G., N.B.



H.M.	Mil. Opns.  Midget is ready.  Shd. prepns for larger opns proceed?  Wd. that bring us to Security Council.

	Shd. we go to Security Council on Hague decn.

	Since memo. prepd Franks has told Acheson of proposals in it.

		His reply:  Harriman is now to be received by M. [Fear U.S. will try mediation – incldg. some proposals unacceptable to us.  Told U.S. we want pressure on M. to accept Hague decn - &amp; consultn in advance. on any proposals.]  Urge us therefore not to go to Sec. Council m’while.  Think that’s right.  Shd. we, however, announce phased w’drawal:  on that U.S. have expd no view – am askg. for it.

		That means we can’t announce before to-morrow.

i)	They are w’drawg.

ii)	We shd. do it as act of strength, not weakness.  Tactical move.  All on spot now agree it’s right tactics to force P. change of mind.



P.M.	Must wait to-day.

	Talk with Leggett.  He thinks Co. were slow in co-opg with Persians.  He said M. thrown up as protest r. corrupt gang.  Tudeh not wholly Comm. but includes many who want changes.  New Govt. may be only old gang. M. reflects discontent with old gang.  We don’t want to be identified with old gang.  Cd. we get someone who isn’t M. but isn’t old gang?  For best elements in P. support M.

	Our posn in Iraq.  Looks as tho’ we may get 50/50 agreement on Iraq oil.  Not only ques. of money:  nationalism also, with best elements backing it.



N.B.	Co. have bn allowed too long to handle this on purely commercial basis.

M. has canalised discontent r. Co. &amp; foreigners.

	Shd. review powers (by minute) of Govt. directors, who haven’t enough control.

	Risk of Commn, which wd. turn out Co.  Seer is only hope:  real reformer.

	Harriman shd. press P. Govt. to accept Hague decn.

	Security Council – favour going there, but not now.

	Phased w’drawal too.  But can’t announce that now.



P.M.	Co. have stood on “concession”.  That’s out of date:  partnership basis is now inevitable. Think we shd. send out difft. type of man to Persia in future.



E.Sh.	i)	Harriman.  If he can only Press P. to accept H. decn, that’s waste of time.  Also wd. U.S. accept such limitn.  What is he to do – if he can’t “mediate”?  Suppose P. declines H. decn.  Shdn’t H. know our views on poss. solution?  U.S. reject mil. approach:  how then is this to be settled.

	On memo.  There are alternatives.  Phased w’drawal = scuttle.

		Serious effect in M/E. e.g. Egypt (Suez Canal).  I feel no ques. of w’drawal, save fr. fields as necessary:  but stay in Abadan.

	Major mil. opn.  3 Battns ready to go to Shaiba:  Guards Brigade also ready.  Cd. risk puttg. that force in.  But we shd. have to follow up with re-inforcemts. incldg. Z. reservists.

	Harriman.  A Govt. has right acquire property in own country.

		We can’t ques. principle:  we can only ask for considn of Company interests.  If they have that right, we shd. admit it.



(P.M. 	We have)



		All we want is to negotiate terms on wh. undertakg. can be handed over to Persians.  Negotiate on basis of acceptg. principle of natn.  That wd. be acceptable to world opinion.

	What alternatives?  Sec. Council won’t help.



P.M.	We have accepted principle of natn.  But not the letter of their (bad) law.



E.Sh.	We have shown resistance – apparently on financial grounds.  Our acceptance has bn. grudging.



J.	W’drawal will be regarded, in U.K., U.S. &amp; M/E., as weakness.  This is what P. have bn. trying to get us to do.

	Don’t announce it yet.  H.’s visit provides excuse for delay.



P.M.	What of view of staff &amp; Co.?



J.	May be inevitable, but won’t look like “strength”.



N.B.	Virtue of necessity – if men are coming away anyhow.

	Irrign plan put fwd. by U.S. previously.  Wd. H. put it up again.



R.R.S.	V. long-term affair.  And P. Govt. wdn’t make up their minds.



H.D.	Memo. is good – tho’ overtaken by events.

	Try to make H. stiff on Hague.

	Welcome paras 2 &amp; 3.  No force to protect property.  Arguments are overwhelming.  Hope Cab. will endorse para 3 – exclude force for any other purpose than saving life.

	Phased w’drawal:  p’pone announcement because H. mission.



H.M.	We have accepted natn, but not breach of contract w’out compensation.

	We have offered means of enabling them to work natd undertaking.



P.M.	We mustn’t stand on lr. of our contract.  Stress offer of partnership and joint working.  Contract isn’t sacred.



H.M.	M. won’t discuss.



H.M.	I’m now convinced tht. w’drawal is right.  M. doesn’t want our chaps to go.

	Problem:  how to make it appear tht. it isn’t weakness.

	Must get H. view on it before we announce it.



A.V.A.	Shall we ever get back?  Shd. we even be able to take mil. action.



G.W.	Tel. fr. Australia.  They hope we won’t evacuate – chaos, Communists, never get back.

	W’drawal as strength.  Impd by Drake’s objn to dribble.  If we want to use w’drawal as weapon, much to be said for taking them all out at once.

	Security Council,  I’m against going there.  Doubt if we’d win: &amp; it might turn on India’s vote – v. awkward.

	Natn.  Have we ever used word “partnership”.  Wdn’t it help to use it.



R.R.S.	Is a statement necessary?

	H. mission.  Fact tht. they accept it is favourable point.  H. cd. provide a face-saver:  e.g. amendmt. of natl law.

	If so, announcemt. of w’drawal – wd. it help him?  Bad effect in M/E.  Co. want it.  Bad effect on U.S.  On balance, p’pone announcemt. until H. has had a go.

P.M.          * 	{Stand on H. mission.  Say no more pro tem.

	{Dribble from oil-fields can continue m’while.



E.Sh.	Can H. be told how far we are ready to go.



H.M.	Yes:  W’ton knew already.  But don’t want him to mediate.



H.S.		i) No. mil. action save to protect lives.

ii) P. has clear right to nationalise.  We have no title to anything           but compensn.  And P. can’t pay it w’out efficient oil operation.

		Hence our partnership plan. Tell H. that.

iii) Lucky we have got Hague decn behind us.  Tell H. important not to weaken that.



N.B.		i) Keep as many men as we can in Abadan.

Court decn is best basis for that.  H. shd. hang on to that.

		ii) Eventual settlement:  H. knows our plan.



H.M.		P.N. Ques. by Deedes M.P. re Colin Reid, D. Tel. corresp., expelled from Abadan.  I’ve asked Amb. to protest.  Shall let Under Secy. answer.



H.D.	Do we endorse para. 3 of memo?



H.M.	As at now.  Not for ever.



E.Sh.	No dissent fr. earlier idea of holdg. Abadan.



P.M.	No agreement with him.



*	No force to protect property in present circs:  but a Tudeh coup might change the circs.



	Economic Pressure.



P.M.	Read note from H.G.  No need to suspend Memo. of Understanding.  Views of B/E.



H.M.	Had hoped we cd. brandish this weapon.

	Are we safe, w’out suspending.



E.E.B.	They have to justify particular transactions.  We shd. be able to look at each on merits.



·	Agreed:  no drastic step at this stage pending H. mission.



	Export licences.



H.S.	Had intended to recommend stopping essential exports to Persia.

	Now comes H. mission.  We want him to urge compliance with Hague decn.  Can we m’while fail to comply with it ourselves.

	Rails are on point of being despatched.

	Denial of rails, sugar etc. wdn’t  damage P. economy v. much.  But diff. to justify sending these scarce things.



H.D.	Can’t we hold it up by adminve steps.



H.S.	Cdn’t be kept secret.



H.M.	Never mind.  Don’t announce it.



A.R.	Don’t unload them.  Delay ship &amp; compensate for that.

					[Enter W.W.

					[Exit N.B., E.E.B.

3.	     Bamangwato Tribe.



G.W.	Opposn Parties won’t send repves.  We can’t therefore.

	Posn in tribe bad.  Further police coming in fr. N. Rhodesia.

	Announcemt. re observers may steady them.

	Can’t be sure tht. tribe can be persuaded to hold Kgotla



C.E.	Incident y’day.  Mtg. of Commrs. of H/C. after which I saw one of our men (Wilfred Bunce) talkg. to Cl. Davies:  he was askg. Davies to raise ques. again in H/C. saying tht. our chaps wd. now vote the other way.

	Davies won’t raise it this time:  he mght do so later.

	Shd. Ch. Whip &amp; I see Burke?



P.M.	Yes.



C.E.	Can we have assurance tht. Tshekedi’s case will be put to Kgotla – either in person or thro’ another?



G.W.	I shall recommend tht. T. be invited to prelim. mtg. before Kgotla.

		And I’ll let that be known to our supporters.

					           [Exit W.W.

			                                                          [Enter T.F. &amp; Wheatley

4.	     Tied Cottages.



H.D.	In 1933 Act – (g) (ii) makes exceptional provn enabling farmers only to create new tied cottages.  About 1.000 new ones are said to be created annually.  Not on farms always, but in villages.

	Sought adminve means of dealing with this.  Can’t do it.

	Propose therefore to promote publicly legn repealg. this provision:  not this session.

	Debates on 1933 Act.  T.W. then spoke r. provision.  He was right.



T.F.	Pity McN. wasn’t consulted.



H.D.	I’m sorry:  told Dpt. to consult you.



T.F.	In ’46 we provided in Hill Farming Bill that cottages provided or improved under that wd. by un-tied.  Opposn wanted them tied.

		We said farmers had enough protn under certificate procedure.

		1949 Act justified on same basis.

	If we now w’draw this protn will it be breach of faith?

	If cert. is not now regud, our statements in ’46 &amp; ’49 were ? unnecessary.



Wh.	We are open to charge of breach of faith.

	There’s also the point re piece-meal fiddling with Rent Acts.  Other problems are worse:  e.g. tied cottage proper.  Will be pressure to deal with other &amp; more urgent problems.



T.W.	This isn’t easy.  Nor non-controversial.  Union agitation is making our problem re tied cottages v. difficult.  Union have now w’drawn their repves fr. certification panel.  Secy. says this will satisfy them pro tem.  I v. much doubt it.

	This is obvious pol. gesture.

	Can we anticipate King’s Speech?

	Shall have to add – special permits to build 

	No. of applns for cottages certs.  2,437 (1946) 1368 granted.

			                                     318 (1951 1st quarter)  185 granted.

	Not all bought over tenants head &amp; turned into tied cottage.

	Farmers won’t buy unless they have to.



C.E.	But he can buy w’out, &amp; then secure, vacant possession.

	Makes a stir.

	No. of applns granted is a bit high.

	Pol. advantage of makg. concessn on tied cottages.



Att.G.	Constant pressure for amendmt. of Rent Acts – we meet it by piece-meal argument.  We can’t go on using that, if we do this.



T.F.	Repeated need for excluding cases where cottage is on farm &amp; has bn. improved with grant on condn of creatg. tenancy.



H.D.	May come under g(i).  Anyway, I’m ready to consult T.F. on this if genl. principle is approved.



			Principle approved, subject to consultn on detailed points.
