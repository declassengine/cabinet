  <content>C.C. 31(60).			17th May 1960


	1.	Summit Meeting.	[Enter O.G., M.R.

R.A.B.	P. Notice Ques likely to be allowed.  
	Latest situation.  Paris Tel. 174.  Send our good wishes to P.M.

O.G.	At 8.a.m. to-day Mr.K. held Press conference outside Embassy – if he didn’t get apology from E. &amp; promise of punishment, he wd. go back via E. Berlin.  He has gone 80 miles outside Paris.


	2.	Parliament.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.  Whitsun recess begins 3/6.  Aiming at 2 weeks’ recess, but shan’t announce on Thursday the date of return.


	3.	Piccadilly Circus.

H.B.	Hope Cab. will support proposed decn. – para. 10.

E.M.	Strong support fr. Traffic angle.  Need 50% increase in flow.  Can we be brght into consultn.?  Cd. this be a bold example of segregation.  Wd. set the pattern.

H.B.	V. ready to launch such ideas with L.C.C.  But beware of cost.

D.S.	Strong support.

R.A.B.	Essential to freeze this site m’while?

H.B.	Can give developer some indication of what he can do: if he were reasonable.

		Memo. approved.	[Exist H.B.


	4.	Relaxation of Import Restrictions.

R.M.	U.S. are pressing for action on canned fruit.  We have no logical economic ground to delay.  But politically embarrassing for us to act – in view of U.S. attitude on shipping, wool etc.,  Wd. indicate to U.S. that when we do move, we will do so on canned fruit.

H.A., H., J.M.	Strong support.

O.G.	Is it wise qua Anglo-U.S. relns.?  They will be annoyed.

E.M.	U.S. are intolerable on shipping.

		Memo. Approved.


	5.	Butter.

H.	Price is likely to drop.  A &amp; N.Z. therefore both oppose any increased quota to Poland.  If crisis occurs, hard to see how we cd. help N.Z.  With EFTA in being, we cdn’t again ask Europeans to practise volunty. restrictions.  
	Poland shd. be limited to 5-7.000 t. in 2nd. half of year.

R.M.	Quota has been running at 20,000 t.  They are asking for 22,000 t.  Ready to decline increase, but don’t want to cut below 20,000 t.  
	Don’t believe A &amp; N.Z. will get into critical posn.  
	Remember how we treated Poland over bacon.  Must give them some prospect of stability over butter.  Otherwise, we shall lose all chance of negotn. with P – with v. gt loss of export prospects.  Enough for A &amp; N.Z. to say we won’t increase the quota.

O.G.	Agree with R.M.

J.H.	Compromise : 17.000 t. from 1/7 (2.000 above the level when we added 5.000) : and that is no more (or less) than they actually sent us last year.

H.	I wd. accept that compromise.  
	We need co-opn. of N.Z. and A. in reln. to Europn. econ. ques.

R.M.	This wd. annoy Poles w’out helping A &amp; N.Z. v. much.

J.H.	5.000 was an exceptional addn. : why shd. we convert it into normal annual level of 20.000.

H.A.	If we want trade with Poland, we ought not – just when we restore bacon cut – to impose a butter cut.  
	True we may have trouble over butter – but this 3.000 t. won’t affect that substantially.

D.S.	If we restored cut on bacon in order to get Polish trade (exports fr. U.K.) it wd. be mad now to cut back on butter.

H.	Warn you tht., if forecasts prove correct, we shall have to help N.Z. – and I don’t see how.  Which does B/T. value more – exports to Poland or good will of A &amp; N.Z. twds E.F.T.A.

R.A.B.	Amount so small : and in view of bacon : balance is in favour of 20,000 t. quota.

H.A.	x|	Give them a year plus a warning tht. we can’t tell what butter situatn.
	  |	will be in ’61 &amp; can give no promises of continuity at 20,000 level.

		Agreed as at x/.


	6.	E.F.T.A. Finland.

H.A.	Good progress in discns.  Looks as if F. will be able to associate pretty closely tho’ short of membership.

R.M.	Discns. have gone better than we expected.  A few minor points outstanding.  Main diffy. is m.f.n. relation with R.  They can’t really associate unless ready to tell R. they will discriminate v. them.  If they can satisfy us on this, want authy. to initial agreement at Lisbon.

J.M.	Effect on paper?  

R.M.	Some increase of imports – but mainly switch v. other imports from Scandinavia.

		approved.


	7.	Kuwait.

O.G.	What shd. we say if Ruler raises revision of agreement.  It is out of date : but on a new deal we won’t get what we want.  No U.K. initiative therefore in raising it.  But U.K. repve. shd. be authorised to act as proposed if Ruler raises it.  We cdn’t deny it if Ruler asked for it.

R.A.B.	What effect on other States in Gulf?

O.G.	Their reason for clinging to us is fear of Saudis – &amp; that is strong.

D.S.	Risky to give Resident authority to respond at once : effect might be to get it raised earlier than it wd. otherwise be.

R.A.B.	x|	Enough to tell him to refer at once for instructions, saying it will be considered 
	  |	sympathetically.
	  |
D.S.	x|	Then refer to Cabinet before you give it away.

		Agreed at x/.


2.	Decimal Coinage.

H.A.	As in memo.  Gladstone favoured this in ’54, but said Govt. must wait for clear indication of public opinion.  
	P’ponement increases cost – as Gladstone said.  
	Best method is to take 10/- as unit and divide it into 100.  V. difficult for us to abandon £.  
	A £ wd. have to be divided into 1.000.  
	S. Africa &amp; N.Z. may do this on basis of 10/- unit.

R.A.B	Don’t “welcome” report.  Invite public comment.  
	Prepare draft of announcement &amp; submit to P.M.
