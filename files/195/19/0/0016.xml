			Polaris.				[Enter C. and M.R.

P.M.	Either reject, with all its consequences; or accept on conditions indicated in draft.

	Dangers of breaking off our long association with U.S. – at a time when they are more likely to move twds. G. or Europe.

	Chance of spinning this out until new U.S. Adminn. is in office.

H.	Depends on formula v control.  We shd. seek the best we can get.
	The option seems to me to be less valuable.

H.W.	Pattern may change – they might abandon Skybolt.

S.Ll.	To decline this wd. be a fatal blow to U.S. confidence in U.K. – esp. at Services level.

R.A.B.	S.Ll. previously said this wd. enable us to influence U.S.  But President now rejects idea of control beyond territorial waters.  H/C. are worried about trigger happy Americans anyhow – this is v. much more dangerous.

S.Ll.	More hope if we can get in on consultn.

P.M.	Unwise to make too many conditions – my first letter resulted in a snub.

	We must work for a more general agreement : gentleman’s agreement.

C.	Latest informn. : they won’t want to come here before February.

S.H.	Formula on consultn. shd. not be such as to upset de G.  Relates it to “UK based” submarines.

J.M.	Sc. pol. scene is covered in tels.  On practical side, hope we can cope with housing problems etc.  Schools etc. Holy Loch is easier.

P.M.	Let us open Clyde – and have experts to choose best location.

		Approved in principle : P.M. to revise draft.
