  <content>C.C.39(60)							5th July 1960


		1.	Foreign Affairs.				[Enter M.R.

		(a)	Disarmament.

S.Ll.	General – suggn. of special mtg. Has bn. abandoned.  U.S. &amp; Fr. against it.
	Nuclear – R. seem willing to carry on.

		(b)	Cyprus.

S.Ll.	Outstanding points resolved.  Settlement shd. now be initialled Wed.

I.M.	W. Paper – planned for Friday am.

		(c)	Cuba.

S.Ll.	Protest made.  Can’t be based on legal grounds – for provisions catering for refinement of Cuban crude oil. Based on general argument of action contrary to Br. interests.

	Avoid appearance of merely supporting U.S. interests.  We have our own.

	U.S. trying to establish an ‘exile’ Govt. – doubtful where to put it.


		2.	Shipping : Cunard Liners.

M.	As in memo.

H.A.	Warning note.  [In reply to P.M. – existing ships were built on Govt. loan : repaid in less than 25 years allowed : market rates.]

	Commitments.  Unless we face taxation at increased rates, as propn. of income we shall have to escape some of these.  No time to take on more.

	Price asked here is too high for prestige gain.
	Other prestige projects – supersonic air liner and space research.  We can’t do them all.

	Two ques. – i) shd. we do it at all.  ii) shd. we do it on these terms.
	Did our pledge commit us to action even on unreasonable terms?
	I wd. have thought not.  These terms are not reasonable.  a) We shd. be subsidising this interest rate – and tho’ our rate wd. drop if co’s profits were low, it wd. not rise if they were high.  b) We are to carry whole of insurance.  c) Incentive to other countries to extend their policy of subsidising shipping.
	Proper solution : co-operation between ourselves and U.S. and France in N. Atlantic shipping.  Uneconomic venture : best return we cd. expect wd. be 3% whereas private industry looks for 10-12% on £30 m.  F. earnings are not attractive enough to justify this subsidy.
	Net figure also likely to be less than these estimates.

	My solution.  Operate Q.E. alone, under co-operative arrangement &amp; p’pone decn. to replace Q.E.

	If that is not approved, seek a better bargain with Cunard.
	Admit that, in view of our pledge, we can’t avoid supporting a reasonable scheme.

M.	Return to estimates at 7% not 3%.
	No chance of getting Cunard to accept higher rate than 4½% - cf. para.12.

E.M.	No hope of getting better deal with Cunard.  This plan is more onerous to them than that for Q.E.

H.W.	I agree : but Q.E. cost £12 m. and this wd. be £30 m.
	No hope of internatl. co-opn. on N. Atlantic.
	Can’t run a [weekly] transatlantic service with 1 ship.

R.M.	Arguments con are not strong enough to release us from our pledge.

M.	Competn. from air – Chandos report sees a future for sea travel.

D.S.	Prestige – more to be gained from being in van of supersonic flight.
	Only argument for going on with this – election pledge.

D.E.	Economist forecast.  Gt. increase in transatlantic traffic.  But prestige prize will be in the air.  Yet no. going by sea will increase absolutely.  Shows it will be good business to keep this weekly service going.  F. earnings must take a/c of effect of landing them here.

	Points to need for more hotels.
	Effect on ship bldg. industry will be salutary.

D.S.	Case for this is economic not prestige.

H.B.	Good reason to believe this ship will be a success.
	Why therefore shd. Govt. bear whole of risk?  In particular, why shd. they also take whole of profit.

R.M.	Dangerous for Govt. to take equity interest in private firms.

P.M.	Better to put Govt. in posn. of preference shareholder.

M.	We cd. get i) earlier repayment, if they make more than 7% and ii) different rate cd. not be negotiated because of terms given by U.S. and France.  iii) re-cover interest or bldg. period, if successful.

K.	These terms aren’t unreasonable because don’t include anything we cd. not have foreseen at the time.  In fact prospects for ship seem better now than in July ’59.

P.M.	1.	Agree to do this on best terms we can get.
	2.	Mills, M/T. and H.A. to re-consider terms &amp;			submit to P.M.  eg. improvements a) re-cover 			interest for bldg. period b) some reward to Govt. 			if cos. profits rise above 7%.  c) Co. to carry 				more of the insurance.

J.M.	Open competitive tender will be difficult to work.

E.M.	Not so difficult now because of changes in structure of industry.  Gives chance of detailed specification &amp;especially for machinery.

	This is technically desirable as well as politically.

P.M.	Politically, this wd. get us out of intolerable choice between Clyde, Belfast and N.E. coast.  Cabinet must not be left to decide that.

J.M.	Admit I can’t press my point if Cunard have agreed to it.

H.A.	Don’t consider this a wise use of our economic resources.

E.M.	Make it clear to Cunard that this doesn’t commit us to a 2nd ship.


		3.	Relaxation of Import Restrictions.

H.A.)		Nothing to add to memoranda.
R.M.)

H.	Odd to do this so soon after restrictions on expanding economy.
	Also promised to give reasonable notice to Australia.
	Strong case for p’poning until autumn.

R.M.	Comm. countries have known for months we were going to do this – expected us to do it in May.

J.H.	Confirm that.  But we are in trouble with Australia over it’s wheat.
	Believe this will displace fresh, as well as other canned, fruit.  Will cause us b/p. trouble over next 5 years.

R.M.	But can’t justify it now on b/p. grounds.

H.A.	Tho’ after that we can stand pat on the rest.
	Of increased imports only ⅛th is due to these relaxations.

R.M.	And we have made corr. increase in our exports.

P.M.	You won’t get much credit for this in U.S. now.  Why not leave it until new Adminn.? 

R.A.B.	How reconcile our defence of Bank rate etc. with this voluntary addn. to our dollar imports.

R.M.	That doesn’t take a/c of our increased exports.

H.A.	We propose this from self interest (exports) not kindness to U.S.A.

R.M.  	We shan’t gain anything in pressure on U.S. Adminn. by m’taining this restriction.

J.H.	If we don’t liberalise this now, we shall have to issue new quota figures in 10 days.

	But, on balance, I wd. favour waiting until new Adminn.

M.	So would I.  

R.A.B.	Me, too.  

H.B.	Increase quota now, and liberalise in the spring.

		Agreed :	make some increase in quota now and liberalise 			when new U.S. adminn. is in.


		4.	Colonial Development Corporation.

I.M.	Difficult debate on Thursday because of pressure that C.D.C. shd. operate in new independent territories.  I can stand this.  But I can’t in addition defend Ty. attitude to Corpn’s. finance.

	Ministers decided to limit to £130 m. and treat that as revolving fund.
	Can just continue it on that basis.  But with Ty. conditions in para.9. I cdn’t get a Board.

	Para 9(a)	I must rely on tight control of equity type operations.
	        9(b)	This wd. leave Corpn. with no incentives.
	        9(c)	Sinclair recommended higher : I agree to pari passu.
			I suggest that ranking shd. be determined on each loan 		on merits (Ty. wd. have last word.)


H.A.	In general we (C.O. and I) are in agreement.  Remaining issues are not v. divisive.

	On (c) I cd. accept I.M.’s proposal.  Or, if he likes, outside loans can rank between our two classes of loan.  Dpts. can settle that.
	On (a) their record is v. bad.  I was ready to put in another £3.2 m. to round off. &amp; treat the total as revolving fund.  I.M. wants £3 m. for new ventures also.  Not keen to put new money in for new ventures.  Must do that on Votes.  Already known that £7 m. wd. have to be written off.

I.M. 		Good case for abolishing it &amp; dealing direct.  But, if we don’t, we 			must give it a chance to operate.  Can’t therefore de-bar them from 			new equity business entirely.

H.A.	To the extent that they can sell off some of their present commitments, they can operate in equity business with what they have saved.
	Need I.M. be so specific in debate?  Leave this until negotns. with Corpn.; and then I will try to be as accommodating as possible.
	I.M. can say in debate Corpn. will continue in equity business, but there will be a ceiling and we shall treat it as revolving fund.
	
	Surely I.M. can discover what Corpn. think of paras. a) and b).
	And I’m ready to consider how these can be adjusted to meet their views.

P.M. 	Must make it plain that C.D.C. will continue.
	In debate it can be said there will be equity element.
		Method of arranging limits &amp; control will have to be 				negotiated with new Corpn.

	H.A. and I.M. to agree on formula to be used in debate.

	Form of amendment to Motions approved.
