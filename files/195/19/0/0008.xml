  <content>C.C. 38(60)								30th June 1960


		1.	Parliament				[Enter M.R.,			
R.A.B.	Business for next week.

I.M.	7/7.  Debate on C.D.C.  Ministers decided in principle that it shd. continue, but there is an outstanding diffce with Ty. – which may have to come to Cab – on Tuesday if agreement can’t be reached.

R.A.B.	Statement before Recess on Parly control of expenditure.  Terms under discn.  Procedure of Estimates CHY.


2.	Disarmament

S.Ll.	R. walk-out.  What next?  Repves at Geneva at first favoured U.N. mtg. before Genl. Assembly: but second thoughts have brought cold feet.  Views continue to be exchange.  (x i.e. mtg of Dis. Commn)  This mtg might result in new body: but no future in 10-Power group.

H.		Wd. precipitate request for incln of China.

D.S.	But wd. give us initiative.  Otherwise we seem to be out-manoeuvred by R.

P.M.	In my ltr. I have asked him to re-consider his posn.  This is a positive line for time being.


3.	Cyprus

Tel. 7.7 from Cyprus

S.Ll.		It looks as tho’ all save finance is at last settled.

I.M.	We have authorised £11.5m.  M + K. ask for £16 + £2 for Turkish community + £1.4 miscellaneous.  Amery proposes £13.84 or £15.84.

H.A.	Blackmail – and v. alarming figures.  As douceur after independence, what will it provoke in way of demands elsewhere.

I.M.	Greatly out of line with anywhere else – e.g. only £12m. for 35m Nigeria.  £5m for Singapore.  V. little available for Mauritius.  Certainly, it will be v. diff. to satisfy other Colonies if we do as much as this for Cyprus.

H.A.	Remember too, that there will be less for oversea aid in future.

S.L1.	But what is the alternative.  What will be the cost if we don’t settle this?

H.A.	This is always the argument: we are out-maneouvred in negotn. Independence followed by financial support is intolerable.

H.W.	But re-occupn. wd. be v. much more expensive.

I.M.	You cd. use same argument for Singapore: and I can’t offer more than 20% of their bid.  £13m shd. be absolute limit for Cyprus.

D.S.	If we speak now, it will be clear that it’s over money.

H.	Only real alternative is to leave Cyprus.  

H.A.	Yes.

R.A.B.	That wd. be impossible.

P.M.	Reviewed history.  If we had conceded crisis there wd. have bn. war in E. Medn.  Better surely to have promoted Zurich agreement.  Doesn’t satisfy Greek Cypriots.  Too late now to think in terms of w’drawing.  We may abandon bases in 5 yrs or so: but at least there will then be a republic to which to hand it.  Can we not stress fact tht. this is internatl. not colonial, problem: to avoid worst repercussions on other Colonies.  We may be able to reduce B. forces there, as time goes on.  But stark fact is: we can’t resume direct rule.

D.E.	But general problem – we can’t continue to meet all our oversea commitments unless B. people are ready to accept redn in current consumption.

J.H.	Agree.  For believe we may have to face same thing in Singapore, Malta &amp; prs. Aden.

M.	A few months ago (in emergency) we shd. have bn. glad to settle for this sort of figure.

P.M.	The cession clause is good – because it does enable us to go away.

H.B.	We have got to make best terms we can – this week.  But if we have to do this sort of thing again, we must give H.A. more support in squeezing economy at home: to make it more viable.

H.A.	This base will be strategic liability, not asset.  Believe the same may be true of Singapore.  Wd. wish that recorded.  But admit that, as things are now, we must get a settlement of Cyprus.

D.S.	After settlement we must review scale of mil. establishments in C.

H.A.	What of Akrotiri.

H.W.	We are committed to move villagers if they want to go: but my belief is that they won’t want to move.  They will do better to stay.

R.A.B	We must settle this, at lowest price Amery can fix.

I.M.	What worries me is that we give to our enemies, but not to our friends.  This must mean tht. I have less to give to Kenya, Nigeria etc.,  There is element of bluff in M.’s attitude.  Do let us look at figures.  £15.8 surely is much too high.

P.M.	General aid cd. be represented as £13m over 5 years.  Remaining items as defence or related projects of our own (e.g. Nicosia).

P.M.	We must get a settlement at cheapest price obtainable.

S.L1.	I wd. offer smaller sum quickly: e.g. £10m + the oddments.

P.M.	On net figures we shall have to go to £13m.  Does he stand on £10m. at first?  Probably, yes.  Agreed: opening bid of £10m. incldg. grant to Turks. etc. = £11.5m.  Plus discretion to go to £13m. if he can clinch it.  F.O.&amp;C.O. to draft, submit to H.A. &amp; P.M.  Later: authorise upper limit of £14.84 inclusive + make Amery come back if he needs the other £1m.  i.e. £12m only for general aid.  And try to get the £1.5m. for Turks w’in the general aid.


4.	European Television Agreement

S.L1.		Agreed betwn. Dpts.

C.H.		Seems all right.

				Memo. approved.


5.	Economic Situation

H.A.	Reserves figures for June will be + £11m.  Some inflow of funds.  But big money is still going into Germany.  Due probably to talk of re-valuation.
