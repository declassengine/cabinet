		1.	Tunisia.					[Enter J.P., J.A.

H.	French digging in : declining to w’draw to earlier posns. w’out assurances : no readiness to negotiate unless evacuation is explicitly excluded.

	Violent Afro. Asian resoln. in U.N. – on which we must abstain.

P.M.	Beginning to favour Troika principle for U.N. because, as it can’t do anything useful, it’s better tht. it shd. do nothing at all.

	Alarming tht. de G. gets increasingly autocratic – unwilling to listen to advice.

H.	We might offer Br. Embassy as mtg. place for negotiation.

	
2.	Berlin.

H.	One certainty.  K. will make his Treaty, to enhance status states of D.D.R.
	Another : world opinion won’t allow war w’out prior negotiations.
	When?  Nil before G. election : for e.g. Oder Neissi line wd. have to be included in any deal.  Start therefore between 17/9 and 17/10.
	What sort?  Direct with R. on presence &amp; access in return for de factor negotiation of D.D.R.  If that failed, we wd. go to U.N. with 2 proposals – that and, alternatively, free City plan.

	Don’t go to U.N. first – that wd. erode W. position.
	U.S. are disposed to prefer to let K. move, then take him to U.N. &amp; negotiate there.  Too risky.  Doubtful if we wd. get sufft. Majority v R. &amp; DDR. latter might behave reasonably for a time, &amp; give U.N. no cause for complaint.

	Believe K. mght prefer my timing.  He wd. be in clearer control at time of negotn.

	Military.  Acheson plans rejected or diluted.  Prob. of 2 divns. abandoned in favour of i) economic pressure  ii) garrison airlift  iii) only then a land operation.  General strengthening of N.A.T.O. is now preferred.

Hail.	Berlin is outpost : must avoid major battle for an outpost.  Failure of mil. strategy.  It is militarily indefensible.

	Balance of advantage in West is now to leave maximum contact with D.D.R. because least satisfactory of all R.’s satellites.  We can erode it.
	Flow of refugees wd. be serious blow to R.

	Situation in which we talk tough on basis R. is bluffing, we mght have another Brizerta – but with nuclear weapons.

D.S.	Recognise weakness of our posn. and base our policy on that recognition.

	i)   Legal.  Only to m’tain troops : access for that.  No legal basis for supplying civilians in Berlin.
	ii)  We have made treaty with W. Germany.  Why shdn’t R. do so with East.
	iii)  Mil. posn. untenable.  No way, short of nuclear, of holding Berlin.  Don’t threaten what we can’t do.  Must convince U.S. of that.
	iv)  Work for reasonable compromise.

S.Ll.	Agree it wd. be mistake to begin in U.N.
	Go for interim agreement, in direct negotn with R.  Aim at 5 p.m.
	Can’t get it unless we make advance on our posn. 2 yrs. ago : for we have gained those 2 yrs.

	Limitn. of forces.  Supervision in W. Berlin – offer something like Free City or regime leading to it.  Access : reorganise D.D.R. de facto and let them manage access.  Somethg. on E. frontier.

	Chance of R. agreement on these lines if G. cd. be persuaded.

H.	Yes : that sort of package + U.N. presence.

M.	D.D.R. has bn. State for 15 yrs. : Berlin its capital.  Favour negotn.

I.M.	Agree.  Element of bluff in our posn.  N. weapons means there is element of bluff in all such situations.  There is bluff on both sides.
	Don’t chuck this card away too soon.  It mght detach U.S. – who might act even less responsibly alone.

	On this point I think D.S. goes too far.

____________________________

Military Measures.

H.W.	Support H.’s approach.  But to succeed, he can’t show this hand too soon.  U.S. v. sensitive &amp; mght. easily go back to earlier rigid line.

	At present : 3.2 b. dollars extra votes : raising 6 more divns. bringing divns. in Eur. up to U.C. 70 strength.  U.S. understand we are more over burdened in N.A.T.O. contn. than any.  But they wd. like us to bring B.A.O.R.  up to U.C. level (another 6.000 to 8.000) &amp; also keep in strat reserve in U.K. somethg. like a divn.

	Our mil. posn. is not strong.  Cd. get ¼ m. men for T.A. on war emergency.  But U.S. are now looking at it as long-term problem &amp; are not calling up reservists.  Good for us politically but not militarily because we can’t add to Regular strengths.
	We can make some minor adjustments in B.A.O.R.  Token re-inforcemt. by thunderbird regt.  No more : can’t provide the 5.000.  On strat. reserve, we cd. thin out in Gulf &amp; E. Africa &amp; claim we had 2 brigades available in U.K.

	This is about as far as we cd. go w’out re-introducg. N. Service.
	To match U.S. requirement properly on long term basis we shd. have to put in selection service.  

R.A.B.	Not enough troops in U.K. to meet civil emergency.

N.B.	State of preparations – not delayed by lack of powers.

K.	Public opinion.  i) No war for Berlin alone.  ii) But if demonstrated tht. this is part of R. plan for world domination, people wd. be ready to die rather than submit to it.  iii) Handicap : feeling that U.S. are rash and brash over this.

	Support H.’s memo.

D.E.	Why shdn’t D.D.R. be recognised.  Support Hail. on this.

P.T.	Both sides playing from weakness – makes it more dangerous.
	Para.12(a) seems crucial.

H.	Nothg. so far (includg. Mr. K.’s statement) has upset K. or made him more likely to act before G. elections.  He believes he can then get a better deal.  Want to convince U.S. tht. nothg. shd. be done to provoke K.

C.S.     x/	Flow of refugees must madden R.  No hope of agreement if it doesn’t include some redn. of that.
	
	Reinforcement.  B.A.O.R. well below even peace time strength across board.  3 A.A. regts. doesn’t help that.  2.000 men, but wrong ones.  Doesn’t improve efficiency of Army.  In 12 mos. B.A.O.R. will run down to little more than 40.000 : how can you increase their strength for a long haul.

H.W.	Agree – A.A. regts. wd. be no more than gesture.  But as such it wd. be some help to U.S.  [Fr. are bringing 2 divns. back fr. Africa.  G. may increase length of service after Election.]  B.A.O.R. will fall to 48.000.  But if it is to be kept to 55.000 &amp; 2 brigades were to be in reserve, we wd. have to have limited N.S.

Hail.	Radical change of policy needed.  We are planning for peace condns. but we face war condns. – not in Berlin only, but Laos etc.

H.    	x/ is a diffy. : we have bn. using our air lift (returning empty) to bring refugees out.  But, on my package plan, stream of refugees wd. lessen.

P.M.	We shd. not call up reservists, have Prodn, or embody T.A.
	Shd. we, as gesture, send A.A. regt.?  (Cost of 3 regts. in D’mark £1¼ m.)

H.W.	My proposal : merely to send one SAGN regt.

P.M.	Don’t go further than promise it to U.S. : don’t do it yet.
	Let 3 fighter squadrons stay w’out decn. on return date.
	Bring some troops back – from Kenya &amp; prs. H. Kong.  M/D. to consider : 2 or 3 units.  H.W. to submit plans to Def. Cttee.

H.W.	Also ask Cassels for his minor proposals to strengthen his posn.

P.M.	Over-riding aim : settlement by negotn.  Must involve give and take.
	More dramatic the posture in advance, the greater the risk of dipl. defeat.  V. gt. risks : for don’t think any U.K. Govt. would fight for Berlin.  Problem therefore is how to induce U.S. to be sensible.
	Mr. K. was shaken by his talk with K. – for he produced no effect.
	They are gradually coming round.

	W. Germany have no intention of fighting.
	Risk : they all will try to get out of it on our backs.
	3 courses.	i) Negotiate before G. elections.  Unwise for reasons 		given.
			ii) Do nothing.  Signature of treaty is not casus belli 			Wait until D.D.R. restrict access.  Tho’ we have no 			legal right to ensure civilian supplies to W. Berlin.  			Objn. :	long delay won’t suit us : dealings with D.D.R. 		wd. damage our case.
			iii) Try for negotiations soon after G. election.

H.	Diffy. (over iii) is that Mr. K. mayn’t be able to get out of his defiant stance without putting it to U.N. before direct negotiations start.

P.M.	Still : we may have to suggest ourselves direct negotiations.  May have to propose it after 15/9 – initial mtg. of For. Ministers followed by mtg. of Heads of Govts.  Don’t need to do that now.  But we shan’t be able (qua. Br. opinion) to allow things to drift indefinitely.

	
3.	Air Corporations : M/East Airlines.

P.T.	BOAC have invested in companies overseas.  Losing a lot on them - £2 m. last year.  Biggest loser (£100.000 p. month) : M/E. Airways.
	Early ’61 they wanted to put more money in : we declined.
	They now have offer from a Lebanese – bad offer : £3.6 m. against investment of about £8 m. : giving loss of £5.6 m. out of £15m. investment &amp; guarantees.  Only £200.000 in cash &amp; the rest insecurely on aircraft etc.
	If we stay in, we shall go on losing at current rate or worse.
	My advice : cut our losses and get out.
	Will emerge in autumn when BOAC will have to disclose.
	Shall get independent man to look into this and report privately.

D.S.	How shall we fare on feeding in to our lines?

P.T.	No reason to believe we shall be much worse off.

M.	Get out.  49% holding gives no control over efficiency.

		Agreed.  Announce during recess.
