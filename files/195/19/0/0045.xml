1.	Laos.						[Enter M.R.

P.M.	Tels. y’day from W’ton, A. &amp; N.Z.
	In Seato mtg. U.S. repve. tried to push for intervention : and we were asked y’day wthr. we wd. agree to Charter Yellow.  Mtg. of Ministers and staffs at 6 pm. leading to F.O. 3005 to W’ton.

	Menzies message – suggests tht. we are holding back – this impression is being put about.  Favours Plan 5 via smaller force.
	Similar message from N.Z. in less alarmed terms.
	At 1 am. today Caccia said news tht. mtg. had taken place.  Followed by W’ton Tel. 1119.  SEATO mtg. p’poned to 3/5.  No news of what occurred at truce mtg.

E.H.	No reason to disbelieve U.S. informn. re mtg.  As they have met, unwise to declare alert (Yellow) because argument in para.6 of F.O. tel. 3005.

	I.C.C. have met in Delhi : prepd. reasonable report : Pok is co-operating.
	
	Wd. suit us if I.C.C. cd. now move to Laos.  Asked Nehru to suggest this – to help in arranging cease fire – no reply from him yet.
	Phonmi has followed our advice to go fwd. into no man’s land : accompanied, at his request, by our mil. attaché to testify to his good faith.

	W’ton spokesmen have bn. issuing appreciation of mil. posn. which differ from ours – tho’ no reason to suppose Admn. differ from us on this.

	U.S. toying with idea of debate in U.N.  We doubt this – scope for criticism of U.S. : risk of resoln. calling on both sides to refrain from intervention.

	SEATO.  As 6 countries favour Yellow, awkward for U.K. &amp; France to appear to be holding back.  Just tolerable at present.
	Ultimate plan : mil. opn. is difft. from that to which Ch. Yellow relates.

H.W.	Mr. K.’s policies seem difft. from those of local U.S. military.
	Yellow relates to Plan 5 not to that Plan modified on lines suggested at Key West.  Need to get firm U.K./U.S. endorsement of modified Plan.  Austr. seem to have bn. misled – presumably by U.S. military.

P.M.	May be argued tht. more forces are needed for limited objective.
	Need is to be sure we agree on objectives.  (Plan 5 contemplated recovery of Plaine de Jarra).

	Risk also tht. in cease-fire talks attempt will be made to discuss pol. aspects.

	If, for any reason, talks break down, SEATO will press for action.  Don’t want operation – esp. when local commanders are at best confused about objectives and plans.

	On other hand risks are v. gt. if Laos overrun.

E.H.	Phonma’s objective in cease fire talks now disclosed.  Not so bad.  Wants only to discuss “modalities” cf. pol. discussions – not the substance.

J.M.	If we stabilise Laos, will Communists transfer pressure to other countries?

E.H.	Yes, probably.  Certainly will go on in S. Viet Nam.

P.M.	Neutral Laos wd. increase pressure on Thailand.  But that is allied country, bordering the sea : and much easier therefore to assist.

H.W.	Lemnister  has now gone out : shd. improve local mil. commander confusions.

K.	Anxieties re postures of U.K.

	i)  Our 1st choice : cease fire.  Why has Gromyko refused channel of Commn. betwn. 2 sides.  

E.H.	He has refused to admit tht. he is in touch with his side.
	ii) Nehru’s initiative, if he takes it.

K.	Both i) and ii) are peaceful moves.  M’while, we are pressed to agree to prelim. mil. moves : wh. as P.M. has put it to Mr. K. may have
      x/	either of 2 opposite effects.  Which of these is least troublesome?

	U.N. see disadvantages of discn.  But if we have to act with SEATO.,
      y/	we shall be criticised for not having first gone to U.N.

E.H.	On x/ balance is in favour of waiting a little longer for cease fire talks before making any mil. move.  Thought so last night : still do.

	On y/ obligns. (Manila) to notify U.N. when action taken.
	If we did that, we wd. follow Jordan/Lebanon precedent.
	Mght get resoln. calling on us to w’draw.
	But even that is better than risking now a resoln. calling on all not to intervene, and prs. deploring earlier supplies of arms and aid.

H.W.	Need, ultimately to defend Thailand.

P.M.	That wd. be 3rd plan : abandon Laos : re-inforce Thailand.
	That wd. involve no immediate mil. intervention.
	My impression is that R.’s posn. in reln. to China is similar to ours in reln. to U.S.

     *	Second half of F.O. 3005 shd. be sent (by M/D.) to Genl. Hull.

P.T.	Must stand solid with U.S. in last resort.

H.W.	Sensible line now is to plan U.K./U.S. re-inforcement of Thailand.
