I.M.	Statement in H/C to-day.  
	Draft approved : statement to be made by Col. Secy.


2.	Law of the Sea : Iceland.

O.G.	All dipl. efforts to bring Iceland into negotns. have bn. exhausted.  Only way of m’taining momentum is to seek discns. betwn. fishing interests on both sides.  Ours wd. be ready to meet.  Industries vice Govts.  Useful if T.U.’s on both sides were involved.


3.	Germany : Supply of Arms.

P.M.	Disturbed at procdgs. In W.E.U. on G. arms.  W.E.U. impose the limits.  G. pretend – after negotn. with us on deliveries – tht. U.K. is responsible for prohibitions.  Fr. are pretendg. Tht. it is UK &amp; not W.E.U.  
	We shd. bring this out into open.  U.K. shd. not take the blame.

D.S.	Germans are v. restive over this.  Allege that Shape say U.K. are v. it.

				[Enter Erroll.


4.	South Africa.

I.M.	Govr. has done utmost to dissuade Ministers – incldg. suggn. they shd. do it as pol. Party vice Govt.  Strongest reason for not using our reserve powers –

i)	Jagon might resign &amp; force us to resume direct rule.
ii)	G.A.T.T. diffies.
iii)	Mght force Nigeria to implement resoln. already passed.

H.	V. difficult.  Not U.K. policy to boycott : we ought therefore to prevent boycott by territories under our control.  V. awkward if it spread to all Colonies.  S. Africa wd. then be provoked to react : if they did so in respect of H.C. territories it wd. be v. bad.  Inclined, however, to think I.M. is right.  Must seek to justify it in reln. to situation in B. Guiana.

		Memo. Approved

5.	Atomic Energy.  Civil Programme.

D.S.	Will delay present weapon p’mme by 1 or 2 years.  But can’t object, as whole p’mme is uncertain.
