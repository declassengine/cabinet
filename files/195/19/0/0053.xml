  <content>C.C.35(61)							29th June 1961


		1.	Parliament.					[Enter M.R.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.

P.M.	W. Benn (Stansgate).  Can’t yet table resoln. for Sel. Cttee.  But if we invite them to submit interim report on suppression of Peerages, Labour might not boycott – awkward if they did so, over whole field, in both Houses.

	
2.	Kuwait.

H.	Iraqi tanks likely to move to Basra qua.  Cd. be there by 1/7;  thereafter no warning – w’in a few hours.  Korea  may be preparing to make a dash : mght be deterred if he knew he wd. meet our forces.  Our troops are alerted – Bulwark en route : tanks in l.c.t.’s.

	Must inform Ruler : warn him we can’t act w’out formal request.

H.W.	Prepns. are in hand : but need Def. Cttee. to run over them.
	C.-in-C. directed to remain at H.Q.

H.	Can we now ask for request – in form in which we need not act until time is ripe.

	Have warned U.S. – no reply.  Shall now give them latest informn.

S.L.I.	Vital that U.S. shd. give immediate political support.  Agreed : warn them of this at once.

	Paid off in past if we have warned Nasser in advance.  Useful if this cd. be done on this occasion.  Ask him if Arab League cdn’t help to restrain Iraq.  Agreed.

P.M.	E.H. to warn Healey – today.

	
3.	Laos.

H.W.	Anglo.U.S. mil. talks – C’wealth Brigade at 7 days’ notice : but equipped only on light scales for anti. insurgency operations.
	U.S. have bn. stocking heavier equipment in Thailand &amp; wd. be ready for limited war opns.  Those are unlikely;  but awkward if our troops were less well equipped.  By pre-positioning equipment we cd. be at same level of equipment after 14 days.
	Not v. expensive.

S.L.I.	Admy. mil. : W.O. ½ m. : Air miny. ¼ m.  And prob., more.

H.	Pol. posn. not bad : U.S. want pol. situation : Phonma, however, has gone pro-Communist in feeling, tho’ Fr. are working on him.

P.M.	Get pol. approval for this – fr. A. &amp; N.Z.  But defer further movement for a while, at least until we have consulted Macdonald.

	
4.	South Africa : Supply of Arms.

H.W.	Minister has agreed to buy small arms from Belgium.  But, apart from this &amp; any other sensitive (politically) items, they are in market for heavy supplies – &amp; we shall sell them.  They are stocking up – on basis they will now stand alone.

P.M.	Can’t deprive ourselves of this export opportunity because of African sentiment.

H.W.	Will report &amp; circulate final list.
							[Enter J.P.


		5.	Cameroons.

K.	As in memo.
	Difference of view on one point – wthr. Foncha shd. be encouraged to apply for extension of trusteeship because of our bad internatl. posture if chaos occurred after our 40 years in territory.

I.M.	6(a) and (b) – already authorised.
	Never before had chaos on independent in Br. territory.  This is fault of U.N., not ours.  Even so, we have bn. trustees : large Br. investment : we shall be blamed, as Fr. were for Guinea.  Can’t press this view : diffies. of remaining are even more intractable.

     	Tel. suggesting 120 Cameroonian ex Servicemen in territory cd. be
        x/.	trained by Gr. Guards.  This shd. be considered urgently : it might help.  Trusteeship Council is sitting until 20/7 : but decn. is by G. Assembly &amp; cd. be reversed only by them.

P.M.	No parallel with Guinea : we are ordered out by U.N.  Can be criticised for lack of native adminn. : but main blame is with U.N.

	We shd. be in much greater trouble if we started to back Mr.  F. against Mr. A.  May be more hope of F. &amp; A. agreeing if we aren’t there.

	Memo. approved : no approach to U.N. for renewal of trusteeship.

J.P.	Mil. operation.  My advisers favour it.  I think it may arouse terrorist activity throughout territory. Some casualties.
	May be occasion for being asked, after all, to stay.

Hail.	Dishonourable to leave w’out clearing this up.

J.P.	Camp is in bush, near frontier.  Not the only enemy cache tho’ largest.
	This operation wd. involve decln. of emergency – first time.

I.M.	Foncha : Commr. have asked military to do this.

H.B.	People on the spot think this shd. be done : we shdn’t counter-order it.

		Agreed  :  allow the mil. operation to proceed.
		On this basis of raiding operation (5 yrs. for War and
		C.I.G.S. to approve instructions.

		x/ above – approved.
		No encouragement to Mr. F. to apply for extension
		of Trusteeship.

	
6.	Tourism.				[Enter Leburn : Rippon.

		a)	Hotels.

S.L.I.	Para.7 is enough of a concession.

Ch.H.	Won’t press this : tho’ shortage of rooms, esp. outside Ldn., is a serious limiting factor on tourism.

		b)	Carnet.

Ch.H.	Earnings from tourism (£188 m.) are rising more slowly than in Europe.

	Only change involved is tht. motoring organisations won’t guarantee payment of duties if cars aren’t removed.  We shall still know what cars remain.  Payment made now is only £10.000.

	Only country in Europe which now continues carnet. – tho’ risks on land-frontier are larger.  I can find no evidence of losses by Denmark – who have in fact now extended their system to lorries etc.  Assured that Holland &amp; France have suffered no loss.  Motoring assocns., not having to do this for any other country, are making it more awkward and expensive to get carnets for U.K.  This is therefore a serious discouragement to travellers.

S.L.I.	I don’t believe this can be deterrent, cpd. with other formalities.
	Alternative check will need to be devised.  Customs believe this will open the way to a racket.  Exists already over N. Ireland frontier.

R.M.	Hope S.L.I. will agree.

		Agreed :  abolish carnet system, provided special arrangements 		    can be made for N.I. frontier.

		c)	Carnet : Aircraft.

S.L.I.	No case for unilateral action on this.

R.A.B.	Leave it at cars, pro.tem.

S.L.I.	Ready to accept any international conference in July.

		d)	Camping in National Parks.

H.B.	Accept first recommn.
	But no point in discn. with L.C.C. – no land there.
	Parks : best sites wd. be just outside, not w’in, Parks.
	Otherwise : ready to co-operate over remainder of field.

	
7.	Germany : Defence Facilities in U.K.

H.W.	Can’t be done w’out order.

R.A.B.	No.  Parly. time.

H.W.	Can we try to get it on nod, in consultn. with opposition. 

M.R.	Oppn. Front Bench cdn’t prevent back bench trouble.

R.A.B.	Will try – after 10 p.m.
