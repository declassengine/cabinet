		1.	South Africa.					[Enter M.R.

P.M.	Message to Queen from Dr. V.  

H.M. 	Wd. like to send a reply.  Draft read to Cabinet.

		Approved.


		2.	Laos.

E.H.	Conference opened, but not going well.
	Cease fire faltering : trying to get I.C.C. to investigate, but R. are awkward.  Seeking formula in Moscow.  If we can’t get one, Harriman will raise it at Conference – awkward.  M’while, I.C.C. have announced their intentn. to go to 3 places : if Pathet Lao accept that, all will be well.

	Formation of Govt.  Looks as tho’ the 4 Princes are to meet in Paris.  If they agree, they will presumably go to Geneva as a Govt.

	Military plan in event of breakdown.  U.K./U.S. agreement is close.
	Plan 5 minus, as at K. West.  Report from C.O.S. tonight.  If implemented, we shd. have to re-inform C’wealth Brigade from B.A.O.R.

	
3.	Iran.

E.H.	Assurances of firm policy, with reforms.  But Nat. Front stiffening – Mosaduk re-emerging actat 84.  In touch with U.S. – oil co. cash etc.
	P.M. resolved to hold them in CENTO.

	
4.	Korea.

E.H.	For. Secy. is in touch with Chiang.  Potentially difficult.  Assurances given v integrity of ? N. Korea.

	
5.	Parliament.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.

	
6.	Education : Teachers’ Salaries.

D.E.	Mtg. today.  Outcome – either i) teachers accept 16.2% offer : unlikely : ii) a break &amp; we can intervene with both sides : because teachers refuse the offer &amp; l.a.’s hold firm : iii) l.a.’s make improved offer : unlikely : but we cd. intervene with both sides.

	Agreement wd. need ratification by executives.  If we can’t approve, better to indicate that before ratification.
	16.2% awkward because higher than Scotland.  But we can’t do as much, on differentials, at a given percentage, as Scotland can.  I ought to have power to amend an agreement – not merely to approve or reject.  We must (generally) have power to make or preserve differentials in order to attract people we need – eg. police, or maths teachers.  S.L.I. willing tht. we shd. take such power.

S.H.	Not yet fully worked out.  But we must get two systems on same basis.  Can’t indicate what we shd. do on this award until we know what it is.

J.M.	I stood on 12% : but made reservations which wd. enable me to go to about 14%.  My decision went well : don’t want to disturb it.  Local union ready to discuss their grievances, before any further strike.

P.M.	Can’t discuss decision on this until we know result of today.
	Small mtg. tomorrow.  P.M., Edn. Ministers, R.A.B., S.L.I., H.B., J.H.

	
7.	Europe.				[Enter Erroll, Braine.

P.M.	Consultn. with C’wealth.  Shd. be offered before we reach decision.
	Propose D.S. shd. go and see them – prs. in 3 or 4 weeks time, when our detailed plans are more clear.

	D.S. would work to a directive approved by Cabinet.

I.M.	Colonies wh. will be independent before action starts.
	Tanganyika not concerned.  But W. Indies wd. be.  This cd. be met if L.P.S. spoke to people attending current Conference.

P.T.	Diffy. : if you ask Dom. how they wd. be affected and wd. they agree, you invite answer No”.  Experience suggests tht. if U.K. present them with a pretty firm attitude &amp; invite comment, you get a better response.  Support therefore last page of draft.  Provided D.S. is able by then to be clear tht. U.K. are shouldering main responsibility.

S.L.I.	Hope Canada won’t think they have veto in this.

	
8.	Legislative Programme.  1961/62.	[Exit Braine, Enter B.C.
								 Enter Dev.
		Note not taken.
								[Exit Errol., B-C.
	
9.	Commonwealth Immigrants.			[Enter J.A.

K.	On figures Cttee. were for first time unanimous for action.
	But no decn. required now because W. Indies Conference &amp; Jamaica referendum.

	Thus, no announcement before October.
	Broad lines of legn. indicated.  Details need further study.
        x/	Real point is that it is now clear we must face the problem.

I.M.	I accept x/. with distaste.
	Must I tell Manley?

P.M.	Think it over.  It may be better for him not to know.

D.	Para.3 of D.S. memo.  No diffy. now over employment – housing and health are the present diffies.

	Employmt. Check (i.e. specified jobs) cd. be evaded by C.O.S. recruiting as Br. Rlways do already.

	Irish Republic is awkward, on legn.
	If Manley is told, D.S. wd. want to inform Dom. P.M.’s.

S.L.I.	Adminve. cost.  

R.A.B. 	We cd. do Immigration for extra £150.000.

P.T.	Examine possibility of basing control on citizenship – tho’ it would involve separating citizenship of U.K. and of Colonies.

		Agreed :  Cttees. to consider means of doing it.

							[Exit Dev.


		10.	Aden.

I.M.	Objective : to stay, and keep defence facilities, as long as possible.
	I believe our best chance of doing so is to keep our friends’ support – moderates in Colony and rulers in Fedn.  Best way of securing this is to encourage merger.

J.A.	Danger of merger : larger unit will ask for independence sooner.
	Def. rights wd. then rest on Treaty, not sovereignty.
	If Col. turned nasty, after merger, Rulers cd. help us to keep order.
	But Col. popn. is small : we shd. be able to control it.
	But agree tht. our friends wd. like merger : &amp; if they agree on terms we cdn’t resist it.  My view is merely tht. we shdn’t take initiative : leave it to them &amp; see if they can come to terms.  Cheaper to leave them to come to us with a scheme.

H.W.	Initiative inevitable – in order to secure moderates the victory in election we must amend constitn. of Colony.  This raises ques. of merger.  And our best friends are Rulers : want to get them on our side.  If we don’t help them over this, they may be less friendly.

E.H.	Doubt if merged territory wd. seek early independence because they fear Yemen.  Also they realise tht. prosperity, esp. of Colony, depends on our military expenditure.

I.M.	Decisive factor is need to keep Rulers on our side.

C.S.	Wd. a merged Fedn. allow us to use it as a base v. other Arab countries?

H.W.	But we must have election in Colony – and must adjust franchise so that moderates win.  Once you do that, you can’t help raising general ques. of merger – or allow it to be assumed tht. Colony can attain independence alone.

P.M.	Can’t expect to hold any base indefinitely in modern world.
	We want it mainly for operations in Gulf – against other Arabs.  How best can we help it for longer via shorter period?

	On balance Rulers more likely to support us longer than popn. of Colony.  Right to get them here : diff. then to refrain from plain
      x/	speaking, disclosing our intentions.  Help them if they want merger : don’t force them into it if they don’t.

Agreed on x/.
