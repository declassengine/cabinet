Economic Situation.			[Enter E.P., P.M.G., J.B.-C.
							 R.W., M.R.

	Remedies – long term
S.Ll.	i)   Remedies - long term :  wages pause to await productivity increase.
	     [In 60/61 personal incomes rose by £1365 m. Prodn. by £500/600 m.
	     [This is simplest way of demonstrating situation.

	Short-term investment &amp; trading profits, incldg. speculn. : shall promise to bring fwd. proposals next year.

	ii)  Public expenditure (home) : short reference in statement : expand in  
 	     speech.
	iii) Oversea expenditure.  Aid : will avoid “ceiling” and will use 
	     formula “not much more”.
	      Private investment in non. sterling area : remittances : have agreed       
	     formula with B/E.  In sterling area we must see what we can do to 
	     control dangerous position.
	iv) Gap – re industry.  Can’t say more on ? practices : little on tariffs as 
	     means of sharpening efficiency.  Not v. much : but this mainly for 
	     industry itself.

		Remedies – short term.
	a)	B/E. agreed on increase (1% or 1½%) in sp. deposits.
	b)	B/E. Will ask investment cos. etc. to be restrictive on loans for private 
	 	investment.
	c)	B.r. 7% from tomorrow.
	d)	Regulator (first) : from midnight.
	e)	Substantial drawing from I.M.F.
		Open ques : x 2nd Regulator C.112.
			        y H.Purchase.  B/E. want it because of credit restrictions.
			        z Shd. I announce teachers’ salaries decisions?

P.M.	Govr. B/E. takes dark view.  Friday was a bad day.
	He favoured steeper increase of Bank rate.
	May be tendency to panic by holders of wealth – stimulated by what Kennedy will say tomorrow.  May be movement to gold via any currency.  Agreed : Br. as proposed.  

	Govr. also pressed for x and y.  On x. he argued tht. we had secured the power : why not use it?  We said money wd. not be large (£60-70 m.) and weapon so unpopular with industry tht. if we used it, we were less likely to hold wage pause.

	On y. amounts lent are large : why not curb them?  We said Reg. 1. wd. affect industries living on h.p. (refrigerators &amp; t.v. &amp; cars) &amp; wd. be unfair to hit them twice.

	In last 2 yrs. we have spent £500 m. &amp; lent £500 m. overseas which we haven’t got.  (Must stop the leak of private investment in sterling area.)  Panic, if it starts will bear on weakest currency.

	My belief is tht. package is enough to win 1st battle. (I.M.F.)  If so, better concentrate on getting industry (both sides) to work together and with us for concerted attack on 2nd – increasing efficiency and pause.

R.M.	Agree on external sitn. &amp; remedies for it.
	On internal, doubt if posn. is as bad as Ty. and B/E. think.
	2nd regulator wd. alienate industry when we want its help. 
	Same for h.p. – which wd. hit them hard, in addn. to other measures.
	Foreign confidence (qua internal policy) will turn on their judgement of our determination to hold wages.

P.T.	Agree with R.M.  H.p. wd. hit narrow band of industry – too hard.
	2nd Regulator : sympathise with B/E. but see practical diffies.
	Pity we haven’t a selective regulator – to increase taxn. on engineering industry if they conceded unjustifiable wage claim.

	On balance, I wdn’t do 2nd regulator.

J.H.	Agree with R.M. and P.T.  If we go too far, we may go beyond point of healthy home demand wh. is necessary to expand exports.

M.	2nd regulatgor v. discriminatory – hits hardest industries in which labour costs are highest.

H.W.	Strongly favour statement on teachers’ salaries – 2 above.
	Against 2nd regulator.  Doubtful about h.p.

D.E.	Against h.p. – mainly because potent cause of wage claims.
	But also because doubt if S.Ll. surplus is enough for this situation.
	B. rate : only value to enable us line on hot money.  Quantity of money is more important than price.  V. expensive to us – in investment.  Better if we cd. have more money, but selective method of using it at cheaper rate.  Clue is size of surplus.
	Need to support Govt.’s internal credit.

I.M.	Against h.p.  For 1st regulator will have effect of restrictg. h.p. contracts.

	For 2nd regulator.  It wd. help – esp. on wages pause : for wage restraint can’t be secured by exhortnn. : only by facts.  This wd. be a fact – like decn. on teachers (cf. N.H.S. clerks some years ago).

J.M.	Spoke v. 2nd regulator : qua discriminatg. in effect. 

H.B.	Ditto.  Support 2. as a fact.

E.M.	i)   Short term : what is total saved.  We shd. reach the £500 m.
	ii)  Wages will be crux.  Not only basic rates; but local, too.
	It is largely a regional problem because push of over full employmt.
	causes employers to pay excessive rates (overtime etc.)

P.M.	Then M/T. shd. reduce demand of their roads p’mmes.

S.Ll.	On E.M.’S (i).  Assured increased in 1 yr.’s time : £1150 m.  Measures wd. cut £700 m. off (assuming £100 m. redn. in private sector).
	But this assumes 5% wage increase &amp; if we get the pause there will be a bonus.  But also assumes £350 m. improvemt. in b/p. &amp; that is v. doubtful indeed.

	2nd Regulator : only £60 m. and 50% of that is found by Exchequer.
	Wd. have preferred to be able to increase rates of p.tax : but no powers.

E.P.     *	We shd. pull in more cash over next few months.
	
S.Ll.	Origin of £500 m. figure - Jacobson &amp; O.E.E.C. (get that off domestic consumption but not in current year).

Hail.	Danger of panic after H/C. rises.  Powers for that?  

D.S	Wages pause is surely crux.  Have we examined bldg. control?

S.Ll.	Operating on this by restricting credit – thro B/E. appeal to lenders of all types to restrict lending for private house bldg, with threat of compulsion if they don’t respond.

	Answer to Hail.  If crisis, recall Parlt. for emergency legn.

S.Ll.    *	Agree with that, but easier to say than to do.

H.	i)  Is S.Ll. going to refer to O.E.E.C. suggn. – &amp; say we will meet it?

S.Ll.	Phasing back £90 m. of investment : £120 m. saved below line : current expre. next year 2½% increase - £100 m. less than bids.  But there are not cuts on existg. spending.

		P.M.	Summing up.

		(1)  Teachers’ salaries : shd. be mentioned.

J.H.	Shd. certainly be said.  But better for M/E. to say it on Wedy.;

D.E.	Take opposite view.  Let S.Ll. do it.

P.M.	Favour incldg. it under heading of Govt. expre.

D.E.	Then I must see Barnham people Tues. p.m.  Can I invite them today?

P.M.	No.  See them Wedy. a.m. (inviting Tues. a.m.)

D.E.	Must it be £42 m.?  I want freedom to give somethg. to head teachers.  Will discuss with S.Ll.

C.S.	Better for D.E. to announce on Wedy.  

P.M.	No.

		Agreed :	S.Ll. to include, in terms to be settled with
				J.H., D.E. and J.M.

		(2)  Hire Purchase.

S.Ll. 	Think of saying we will watch this &amp; act if necessary.

R.M.	Wd. create uncertainty &amp; possibly lead to forestalling.

P.M.	Useful, however, to B/E. in spkg. on credit restrictions.

		Agreed : Don’t do it : don’t threaten.

		(3)  Second Regulator.

			Agreed :	Not to be applied.  Mainly because of 				argument v increasing costs.

H.B.	Against announcing tht. level of next year’s estimates will exceed this years by not more than 2½%.  Wd. tie our hands.

P.M.	Put it other way round : save £100 m. : this means increase won’t exceed 2½%.
It’s a total – 2% ceiling for each Estimate.

P.M.	Standards have become too high – incldg. entertainment, as well as salaries etc.  Industry too.
