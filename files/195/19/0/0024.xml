  <content>C.C.62(60)							8th December 1960


		1.	Parliament.					[Enter M.R.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.


		2.	Civil Service Pay.

S.Ll.	Two mtgs. of E.P. Cttee.  Trying to extricate ourselves from P.R.U. complications.  Two methods – P.R.U. or central pay settlement : first is piecemeal, second is general.  Agreed tht. second shd. operate when wages index has risen by 5 points and will be prospective : that P.R.U. surveys will be quinquennial &amp; relate to date of Jan 1. in the survey year.

	E.P.C. decided last night that we shd. award increases from that date – wthr. retrospective or not.  But limits degree of retrospection &amp; introduces element of certainty.

	We are likely to get 4% settlement – less than arbitration wd. award.

M.	Have opposed retrospn.  but this arrangemt. is acceptable.

	
3.	Economic Situation.

S.Ll.	Bank rate is being reduced by ½% today.  Public reason will be out of line with rates abroad.  No indication of change of domestic policy.


		4.	Law of the Sea : Iceland.

K.	Explained situation as outlined in his minute to P.M.

C.S.	Agree : but want acquiescence of industry and can’t go further.

		Approved.

	
5.	Foreign Affairs.

		a)	Congo.

H.	K.’s prestige enhanced by repn. in U.N. &amp; he has his chance.  But he has allowed Col. M. to run riot : L. has bn. maltreated : R. have bn. given opportunity to raise it all again in Sec. Council.  We shall be faced with v. diff. resoln. : we may defeat it : but our African friends are weakening in their support.

	Best chance of holding posn. is to get K. to hold mtg. with regional leaders on constitutional issues before any U.N. Council Cttee. arrives.

		b)	Laos.

H.	Sitn. is going worse.  U.S. are keeping Fuma (Phouma) going – tho’ they agreed with us tht. Fuma (Phouma) was best bet.  Fuma (Phouma) is now favoured by U.S.  U.S. have always hankered after S.E.A.T.O. intervention : danger tht. this may be revived.

	We may have to revive idea of sending back the Commn.

		c)	Finland : E.F.T.A.

R.M.	Finland has signed agreement with R.  We have to consider wthr. despite that, we can have them in E.F.T.A.  Trouble with G.A.T.T. had R. to put similar pressure on Norway and Sweden.  But general feeling is that on balance pol. advantage of not driving F. into R. arms is overriding.

	E.Q. Cttee. will be considering this tomorrow.

S.Ll.	Shall have to secure acquiescence of Canada &amp; U.S.  [Also a second condn. not heard].  These 2 things will have to be explained to E.F.T.A. Ministers on Monday.

	
6.	Public Investment Programme.		[Enter P.M.G.

S.Ll.	New basis offering margin of flexibility.  Dpts. can plan with certainty on minimum.

E.M.	Para.5 reserves posn. of B.T.C.  But if Euston/Crewe electrification goes ahead (as I think) my figure will go back to original £200 m.

P.M.G.	If maxima intended to be inflexible, I wish to reserve posn. of P.O. until I have had chance to discuss with Ty.

P.M.	Telephones are productive &amp; remunerative : we shd. be ready to extend it.

S.Ll.	Ready to look at this.

R.A.B.	Wish to discuss with Ty. provision of remand houses &amp; magistrates courts.  Hope we can make off-setting adjustments elsewhere.

								[Exit P.M.G.


		7.	Housing Policy.

H.B.	Memo. concerns only 2 ques. on wh. Housing Cttee. cd. not agree.

	a)  Houses to Let.

	Admit there is element of concealed subsidy.  But ques. is really political : if we do nothing to prime this pump we have no answer to Socialists.  W’out this weight is all on side of municipal ownership.  We ought to act in this Parlt.

P.M.	Non profit making corpns. wd. be allowed to borrow at 6% (but w’out subsidy) instead of the market 8%.

S.Ll.	Qua investment, Ty. posn. is preserved : these houses count v. nos. in public sector.   Subsidy point :  I can swallow this because Corpns. will be non profit making.  I recognise pol. advantages.  They outweigh the objns. of Ty. officials.

	Can Minister ensure tht. rich don’t occupy these houses?

H.B.	Sort of assocn. I wd. support will restrict activities to deserving tenants.
	They have a social service b’ground.
	Limit of £3.500 p. living unit.  

S.Ll.	Quite high outside Ldn.

		Scheme approved.

		b)	Improvement and Conversion of old houses.

H.B.	3 m. houses need this.  130.000 grants this year.  Main impediment is limit of 8% return – esp. if he has to pay that interest on his money.  I want to increase that to 12½%.	Agreed.

	House on which grant made must remain w’in a rent limit for 10 yrs. -tho’ owner can sell to occupier after 3 years.  Propose to reduce rent limit period also to 3 years.  Wd. remove incentive to sell.  Will apply only to de-controlled houses.  H. Policy Cttee. felt it wd. be confusing – wd. be misrepresented as further measure of de-control.

	Won’t press for it if Cab. so consider.

R.A.B.	Bill is courageous enough w’out this, which may raise ques. of de-control.  

Ch. H. 	Agreed.  Limitn. to addl. rent controversy.

		Agreed : exclude this proposal, on pol. grounds.


		8.	Europe : O.E.E.C. Re-organisation

S.Ll.	O.E.E.C. task completed : will collapse unless re-organised.
	This also gives chance to get U.S. firmly in on econ. consultns.
	Hope therefore I shall be authorised to sign this.  It is as far as U.S. can go – tho’ Swedes and Swiss will think it inadequate : it doesn’t give scope for trade.

D.S.	Will cause some misgivings in C’wealth.  Some will press to be included – no geographical limits now.  Japan comes in : why not Australia?

D.E.	In U.N.E.S.C.O. European members are v. unpopular with newer countries – organising to keep the gap in living standards open.

		Approved.


		9.	Commercial Policy : Japan.

R.M.	On detail much thought will be needed.  But in principle this must be right approach.  Wd. get us in f. k posn. in J. Market.

S.Ll.	If we accept alternative (a), we must have a sensitive list.
	Disputes can’t go to independent body (para.4).
	There are 2 important points –

I.M.	We are content with this.

D.S.	This will move I. and P. to ask for similar power to impose restrictns. at their end.

R.M.	Few cases in wh. J. will be able to do so.  But admit we cdn’t treat I and P. differently.  If therefore I. and P. cdn’t do it, we cdn’t allow J. to do it locally.

		Approved as basis for negotiation : R.M. to keep
		E.P. Cttee. informed – esp. on content of sensitive list.

	
10.	Suez Finance Company.

S.Ll.	Think we shd. sell when circs. favourable – i) on price and ii) on risk of repercussion on our compensation to our nationals for loss etc.
	Ques. of timing.  But can I choose best time – on assumptn. tht. Cab. have no objn. in principle.  Don’t now favour sale early in N.Year.

D.E.	Large holdings in Sahara oil – is it wise to sell these at low price.
	Advice of oil cos. wd. be useful.

P.M.	Get advice on potential future value.

D.S.	Warburgs have a plan for using our share for Commonwealth Developt.

E.M.	This Co. are also in Channel Tunnel business.  

Hail.	If that materialised, it wd. be to our advantage to be shareholder.

		Agreed : S.H. to consider future of the business.

S.Ll.	On the other side, pol. advantageous to use proceeds of sale to supplement our compensation to those who suffered by Suez.
	[Not to be recorded – lest pressure be provoked.]
	

11.	Tourism.

R.M.	Earnings v. large.  Cd. be increased.

	i) Hotels.  Burst of activity now : prs. mainly in London.
	ii) Holiday season.  Cttee. is examining.
	iii) Travel restrictions.  A handicap.  Belgians, where they 
	are reduced to identity card, put their inflow up substantially.

R.A.B.	Informn. collected &amp; cd. be made available to any enquiry.
	Physical condns. at ports urgently need improvement.

P.M.	Most easily expanded form of exports.

	Will convene a team of action people to see what more can be done.

	Agreed.

D.S.	Cd. provide incentives for this, even tho’ not for exports proper.
