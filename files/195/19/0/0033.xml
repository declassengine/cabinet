		1.	Northern Rhodesia : Constitution.		[Enter M.R.

P.M.	Purpose of Conference : to bring component parts of Fedn. on twds. the point at wh. they cd., acc. to preamble, themselves decide wthr. to remain w’in Fedn. – &amp; so pave way for independence of Fed n.
	U.F.P. boycott, at dirn. of R. Welensky.  This has meant tht. their pressure were exercised via Salisbury to D.S. and me.

	We finally evolved plan which is fair and holds balance multi racially.  The problem arises, after all, from prescence of Europeans.  Our plan is not acceptable to African Parties.  They give lip service to multi racialism but demand majority rule.  So do Europeans.
	Each side want system in which results of election will be certain – an odd concept to us.

	Africans and our Press think we have sold out to R.W.  Salisbury thinks we have sold out to Africans.  At least no one has paid us.
	In bldg. Empire you work from secure base.  In transforming it we have no base.  We (U.K.) shd. have gt. diffy. in getting troops into Fedn. if Europeans were sour.  But we cdn’t today fight v. Europeans.  On other hand, if we really sell out to R.W., we shall have to quell African disorders not only in Fedn. but elsewhere, in E. Africa.

	Can we adhere to principles of our scheme, but leave room for adjustment in details?

	Two fears :	i) S. Rhodesia plan : we need it to go fwd. : we don’t want to imperil referendum.  E.W. might secede.
			ii) Impetuous action by R.W. in reln. to Fedn. of these two, second wd. be much the more serious.

	Only 2 courses open :	a) record lack of agreement, have a period of pause (4-6 wks.) &amp;hope for better atmosphere.
				b) proceed to announce our plan and negotiate on it.  Oppn. from both sides : but not prs. violent or desperate.

	On balance I suspect risks of a) are greater.  Positions wd. harden : our own wd. not be clear : passions wd. be roused : U.K. wd. not be in good posture.

K.	Our plan is defensible – it rests on multi racial principle.
	Why is it not acceptable to Salisbury?  Because U.F.P. fear they can’t make successful multi racial appeal.  They cdn’t appeal to lower roll : Dom. Party cd. do as well as they on upper role.
	They therefore want upper role to dominate – 4:1.
	Other pol. diffies. : Party Conferences there this week and open to extremist attack.

	If we go ahead : my guess is they will not go on with S.R. plan :  U.F.P. can’t co-operate in N.R. : S.R. can’t stay in Fedn. on this basis.
	But words, not action.

	If we take course (a) – delay – all will assume we shall adjust our plan to meet views off Europeans.  Believe this wd. cause riots in N.R. – based on allegn. tht. R.W. vetoed our (I.M.’s) wish to give African majority : and they wd. be put down by Fedn. troops.

	I vote therefore for course (b).  Can’t w’hold W. Paper, when contents are broadly known.  But present our plan in such a way as to maximise the room for negotn. : eg. para.13 of C.R.O. 327. wh. leaves real field for decn. eg. nos. of 3 groups : %age to qualify : no. &amp; character of constituencies. 

I.M.	Always knew we wd. reach this posn.  We knew we cdn’t meet full point of view of Africans or Europeans.  Double danger : Europn. Boston T. Party : African – violent revulsion.  Chance now of avoiding both.  Africans are opposed, but not violently angry.

	Europeans : final telegram (drafting : we cd. meet 2 out of 4) is much less abusive than many earlier ones.  Moffatt’s support of plan is helpful.

	Wh. Paper shows tht. our final plan is consistent with my 1st speech made with authy. of Africa Cttee.

	One diffy. : many members of M. Commn. favoured A majority in Leg. Co. in N.Rh.  But, generally, they favoured parity in N.R. w’in parity w’in Fedn.  M. Commn. chose racial approach to parity : wrong view, challenged by Mrs. Huxley etc., 20:20:20 is what she recommended.  I.e. parity, but not achieved by balancing black and white.  This is our plan, not dictated by either side.

	I cdn’t myself support course (a).

D.S.	Transition from Europn. control to stage in wh. A. will play dominant part (tho’ tht. is diff. from A. dominn.).  Dangerous to move fr. white to black control overnight.  Object of all constitl. change is to ease transition.  Must therefore aim at encouraging moderate multi racial elements.  Believe they exist &amp; will emerge if encouraged.

	In past 7 yrs. opporties. have bn. lost.  This doesn’t mean we shdn’t make a last effort.

	Our plan conforms to that objective.  Fact tht. both sides reject it doesn’t make it less sound : may mean tht. it is a reasonable multi racial approach.  Prob. grd. for objn. is tht. elections are left uncertain.  If it produces middle men, it will be good.  Not a strong Govt. prs. : but compromise is essential now in C. Africa.
	The double danger.  Two wks. ago risk of Eur. violence was great – but they had no plan to object to &amp; cd. be content with slogans.
	Temperature in Salisbury is now lower.  We can take risk tht. it will be words not action.  African disorder will prob. be controllable.

	Conclude – our plan is right.  We shd. go forward with it.

H.,	If Europ. believe Govt. will get out of responsible hands, there is risk i) S. Rh. will secede &amp; look twds. S. Africa  ii) Fedn. will declare themselves independent.  We are near that point.

	If Sal. feared this plan wd. have that result, they may act.
	If no Fedn., what wd. we do?  Multi racial soln. : but how fast wd. we go?  Remember Congo.  Believe we shd. aim at getting 2 Parlts. during wh. moderate Africans cd. be brought into the middle Parties.

	Gt. risk of dividing Africa, black and white, on line of Zambesi.
	With v. gt. doubt, I am ready to support this plan – if there is room for adjustment to enable moderate Africans to join such a Party as M.F.P.

Hail.	We must publish – for we must be able to defend a position.
	Ingenious plan : danger that it is too clever.
	And say we are ready to go on with it.
	Similar action on Cyprus was catalyst which produced soln.

J.H.	Agree with I.M. : posn. is less bad than I expected.  This is defensible plan.

P.T.	Agree.  Danger of delay is the greater.  What is Party posn.?

H.W.	Agree.  Must make our posn. clear : it is defensible.

S.L.I.	Do we believe plan will work.  Is there a chance of producing multi racial society in Fedn.  If not, is this point of no return for S.R.

P.M.	On complexity – remember tht. v. complicated franchises etc.  are common in Colonies.

I.M.	Yes : by comparison with many African states this is quite simple.
	Much easier than 1958 system in N.R.
	This is a world of fancy franchises – wh. we in U.K. have forgotten.

E.H.	Right to go ahead with this.  But doubtful on long-term.

Ch.H.	First serious effort at multi racial structure.
	Absence of any Govt. statement is giving bad Press – and undue personalisation.  Essential to make it clear tht. this is a united Govt. plan.

	Important to get discn. of detail.
D.E.	Can you say you have a plan if you leave over for discn. detail of electoral rolls.  We can’t allow R.W. to push us into settling this so tht. there is certainty of Europ. majority.  If that is put over us, we shall be accused of bad faith.

M.	Publn. of plan is essential if we are to stop posns. from hardening.

J.M.	Agree.  But can we accept R.W.’s 4 points.

R.M.	Publish plan : but can’t believe this system will succeed.

I.M.	N.Rh. has had 7 constitutions – all imposed.

R.A.B.	Quoted I.M.’s statements at Conference – non-racial.  We shd. publish plan and support I.M. in it.

	V. gt. importance tht. we can all support this plan.

	Party : does this adhere to 1958 principles?  We can say it does.
	Important to give R.W. time to include Africans in his Party.
	The future is a different matter.  I can’t say it will be final.
	R.W. is a hard friend to help.  Impatient with Africans.
	In S.R., if E.W. loses out to Dom. Party, there will be swing to Union.  That is inevitable, too, if Fedn. collapses.

	Despite all these uncertainties, this is honourable line for U.K.
	Govt. to take.

	Southern Rhodesia.

D.S.	Quite impossible to forecast developmts.  E.W.’s political posn. is v. precarious.  He is bound (by election pledge) to refer any constitutional change to existing electorate.  Events in N.R. will affect referendum.

	Hope we can say we will back results of S.Rh. conference, despite rush out by African Party.  They agreed : indeed these were their words.  They have bn. thrown over by supporters.

		Agreed.

	Northern Rhodesia (resumed).

E.M.	No reason for delay.  Hope we can present plan in intelligible way?

C.S.	Agree – proceed.  Alternative involves a worse risk.

H.B.	Agree : must announce our plan – boldly.

 
	Procedure.

I.M.	Cd. we say to Press today tht. Cab. approved plan &amp; Col. Secy. will make statement tomorrow.  This wd. give us another day to reply to R.W.

	On R.W.’s suggns.	Para.4.  We cdn’t meet this : tho’ we might adjust wording.  E.g.  The method contemplated for national roll …
			      	Para.7.  Originally proposed 100.000 : we have gone down to 70.000. 45.000 rquire literacy qualifn. under A.  Those under B. don’t speak English : but they are “responsible”.  

D.S. 	You cd. get home on this if you cd. use the word “literacy”.  

I.M. 	We cd. add, in the legn., [complete] “without assistance.”
				Para.8. We cd. omit words ..... but ….. Roll.  Stet only first phrase and numbers at end.
				Para.11. We can meet him completely.
	Words can be found.  

D.S. 	‘A constitutional council’ via ‘necessary machinery’.

	Statement in both Houses Tuesday.  Wh. Paper available at 4 pm.  Also in separate Wh. Paper the statement as statement of Govt. policy.
