C.C.47(60)							28th July 1960


		1.	The Cabinet.					[Enter M.R.

P.M.	Envoi to H.A.  Welcome to P.T. and C.S.


		2.	Parliament.

R.A.B.	Propose on 1st day after recess to get a debate on procedure for control of public expenditure – as well as concluding stages of Bills.

	Business for other 2 days.

	Shall announce today tht. colour film will be made of Opening.


		3.	Nyasaland : Constitutional Conference.

I.M.	Second reading discussions.  Parties are far apart.
	Welensky’s diffy. – franchise.  I have modified my proposals in his dirn. and in line with Monckton’s recommns.

	My plan will be tabled now – &amp; trouble may begin on Tues. or Wed. of next week.

H.	If no agreement, play for adjournment so as to get M. report out.


		4.	Shipping : Cunard Liners.			[Enter E.C. Secy.

E.M.	Tentative agreement reached with Cunard.  Cash benefits to Co. altered –

	i)   insurance will be paid by Co.
	ii)  interest at 4½% which bldg. will be added to loan – not paid.
	iii) no abatement of interest if Co.’s earnings go below 3%.

	In return loan will be repaid over 25 years, but accelerated repayment provn. is less good.

	To keep contn. costs down, shares are 2 to Govt. and 1 to Co. – with max. Govt. constn. of £18 m.

	All concerned are agreed that this is a satisfactory deal.
	Have seen Tory Cttee. in H/C - most accept this and wd. welcome early statement.


A.B.	This is a better plan than Chandos -  Ty. ready to concur.

M.	Cab. 3 points have bn. met at cost of shortening acceleration.

P.T.	Alternative crossing by air will hit this ship badly, but recognise extent of our commitment.

M.	We were satisfied tht. there wd. be room for both in view of increased total volume of traffic.

A.B.	Ty. objectn. to 4½% interest rate is so great tht. we wd. prefer to give outright grant of £3 m. and charge normal 6% on the loan.

H.B.	I prefer this qua housing, where we decline to give specially low interest rates.

P.M.	Improvement in terms has bn. secured.
	Announcement.  Can’t be ready before H/C. rises.  Better therefore to keep it back for 2-3 weeks.


		5.	Law of the Sea.			[Enter Att. G.  R. Allen.

J.H.	Trawler interests have refused proposal of their leaders to open negotiations with I. industry.  T.U. repve. wd. have bn. ready to go.
	M’while I. repve. in N.A.T.O., who is coming here to talk to F.O., has approached Br. industry.  He is persuasive.

	Decn. on protection wd. have to be taken several days before 12/8.

P.M.	After talks with I. repve. they may be invited to go.  They wd. then assent.

S.Ll.	Try that, certainly.  But we have reason to believe they have decided what to do on 12/8 if we defy them.  What do we do if they leave N.A.T.O.

H.	Still doubt wthr. Canada wd. support us in firm action.

P.M.	Weakness of our posn. is tht. we have agreed to stop in 5 years.
	Effect on Norway?  S.Ll. They wdn’t conclude if there were incidents.

K.	They certainly wdn’t if we had given way altogether to I.

Att.G.	But if we are trying to get agreements our line shd. be to persuade our industry to refrain from fishing for an extended period.

J.H.	Owners can’t restrain their skippers

P.M.	Get Anderson to persuade I. industry to invite ours to talk.  Then press our industry to accept the invitation.

R.A.B.	Basis of our policy must be firmness backed by naval protection.  But no threat of that yet.

I.M.	Work for a review by N.A.T.O. first – get more pressure on I.

Att.G.	But that means trawlers must stay outside m’while.

J.H.	And they won’t – their patience is exhausted.

P.M.	Further decision will prob. be needed by 5 or 6 Aug.
	Try for industry/industry talks.
	If that fails, send a Minister to I. – and then ask trawlers to wait.
	If both fail, Cab. must re-assess the situation, on basis of memo. weighing, advantages &amp; disadvantages of alternative courses.

							[Exit A.B., Att.G., R.A.


		6.	Cyprus.

H.	Makarios &amp; K. agree they want C. membership; and suggest we canvass other members informally.  Suggest we advise them to get into U.N. first.

	But undertake to sound C. opinion.

P.M.	Let their independence be tested first by U.N.

I.M.	Tory Cttees. in H/C. – experts want C. in but in general body of Party may be majority opposition.

K.	Logic of arguments is v. admission.  On other side, climax of policy on C. and goodwill in Cyprus : must accept, with regret.

S.Ll.	Want them in.  P.T. and E.M. same line.

R.A.B.	Take it slowly.  Party not united.

		Agreed :  advise them to go to U.N. first.

			    membership.
