  <content>C.C.7(61)							16th February 1961


		1.	Parliament.					[Enter M.R.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.


		2.	Coloured Immigrants.

K.	After 2 yrs. of low figures, rise to 60.000.  Total now 300.000 &amp; projects to 1½m. in 20 years’ time.  Housing posn. is serious now : even at 40.000 p.a. it will frustrate slum clearance problem.  Health : small but awkward problem on t.b. and v.d.  Public order : not too bad, &amp; contained.

	Apart from principle of mother country &amp; discrimn. v. coloured, two special problems i) bill of rights in S. Rhodesia : we are making rather a point of this.  ii) W. Indies independence conference : legn. on this subject mght. cause them to leave C’wealth.

	Motion by Osbourne M.P. on 17/2.  Oppn. amendment.
	Line suggd. by R.A.B. – watching sitn. : diffies. of principle : welcome expn. of Parlt.’s opinion : i.e. a stalling answer.  Ministers to abstain on both motion &amp; amendment.

I.M.	W. Indies : intend to proceed via conference to independence as soon as internal diffies. resolved.  Fraser seems to be persuading them to do this.  Immigration is peculiarly Jamaican problem : &amp; if they stood out of Fedn. it wd. collapse.  Specially awkward moment for this.

R.A.B.	Agree with K.’s concln..  Cdn’t announce legn. tomorrow.  But there is strong feeling in Party. Glad tht. I.M. is prepd. to support legn. at some stage.  Possibly requirement of labour permit wd. suffice.

	On vote tomorrow, try to vote down Labour amendment.

M.R.	Might be able to talk it all out.


		3.	Steel – Realisation Agency.

		No note taken.


		4.	Rhodesia : Federation.

I.M.	Re-actions to our proposals in Conference.
	Labour Oppn. will wish to see P.M.
	Statement in H/C. next week.
							[Enter J.A.


		5.	Defence : Exchange of Information on Aircraft Movements.

J.A.	Gib. can’t receive early warning of attack.  This wd. put them into U.S./Spanish system.  Required only in global war.

H.	Awkward politically – but has gone rather far.

P.M.	There are no air defences in Gib. to be alerted.  Is it worth incurring any political cost for this?

	Cd. we not at least p’pone this?

P.T.	Wd. be marginally useful to civil aviation – to avoid mistaken identification of a civil aircraft in a time of tension.

P.M.	Cd. make an arrangemt. v. quickly, at Command level, in a time of tension.

H.	H.W. cd. verify from Macnamara wthr. U.S. attach any importance to our coming in.
								[Exit J.A.

	
6.	Germany : Defence Facilities in U.K.

H.W.	Only diffy. is over tank training.  No local objn. from M/Welsh Affairs.  Main trouble is national political.  We cd. try in discussions to steer them off it.

	Cd. we settle the other facilities anyhow?

H.	In France, despite attempts by Communists to make trouble, it went off quite well.

Hail.	G. is an Ally, if we are too sensitive, we shall fail to educate our public opinion to accept this.  A part of our policy of tie-ing in W. Germany.  This particular proposal is not too much to bear.

R.A.B.	We shd. be making Visiting Forces order, when G. have not ratified N.A.T.O. agreement.

H.W.	We cd. consider i) wthr. it is necessary ii) if so, wthr. we cd. make it a condition that G. did ratify that agreement.

D.E.	Support Hail’s view.  Anyway, our younger generation is more international minded.

P.M.	Consider wthr. Visiting Forces Order is really required.  * N.B. to go into this.

Ch.H.	Don’t oppose this : but be sure we have sound arguments for doing it.

E.M.	Better be sure they wdn’t w’draw if there were a row in H/C. esp. on Visiting Forces order.

C.S.	Must do things which are necessary to the Alliance.  But I’m doubtful if we can make a really good case for the tank training.
	i) nice for our regiments to come home to ranges  ii) G. intend to use Fr. not Br. tanks.

		1.	Allow discussions to proceed.
		2.	Look into Visiting Forces point.

M.	Put it into N.A.T.O. context.  Give the facilities to N.A.T.O. not Germany.

	
7.	Commonwealth Youth Trust.

P.M.	Try to avoid publn. of summary.  If you appoint confidential enquiry, you don’t publish its report.

D.S.	I wdn’t even refer to the Cttee. in our statement.  Confine it to our hostel scheme, with passing reference to other activities too.

H.	D/Ed.’s interest.

P.M.	If D.S. can get away with that, let him try.		Agreed.

D.E.	Hostel p’mme shd. be co-ordinated with provision for Br. students.


		8.	Congo.

H.	R. re-actions to L.’s death.  Risks i) air left via Egypt  ii) pressure on Ghana etc. to support G. with their troops.
	U.S. are asking what we cd do on i).  Best course wd. be for M.’s troops to get to airport at Stanleyville or put it out of use.  We will consider possibilities &amp; report.

	R. are using this to undermine H. in U.N. and secure a Triumvirate
	They are sending comm.ns. to their man on H.’s Secretariat.

P.M.	M/D. to have technical appreciation of R. diffies. in getting into Stanleyville airport

	We shd. leave H. to stand firm – order Ethiopians to block airfield.
	He has lost R. support in any event.  It is his duty to forestall intervention by R. or any individual state.
	
	P. Dean shd. be instructed to stiffen H. on these lines.
