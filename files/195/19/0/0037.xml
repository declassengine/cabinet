		1.	Laos.						[Enter M.R.

H.	Pathet Lao gaining ground – royal forces being worsted.
	Phonmi - Souvanna conversns. broken down &amp; P. has gone abroad.  Have put it to Rusk tht. I.C.C. shd. meet in Delhi : 2 co-chairman shd. appeal for cease fire.  I.C.C. shd. report when that has happened : conference shd. then be convened.  Conference of 14 countries.
	U.S. are seeking pol. settlement; but make cease fire a pre-condn.

	
2.	Congo.

H.	Improvement in relns. with U.N. forces, since Dyal left.  Genl. Alex told me it wd. be poss. to neutralise C. army with their consent, under U.N. resoln. – if he cd. be authd. to talk to them.  Negotns. by soldiers on spot : to bring them into a role with U.N. troops.  More lift to deal with Kartonga : but if others integrated first Tshombe mght. be handled more easily.  

	Discussion in P.M.M. unsatisf. – no unity of purpose.  N. and N.K. on one side : Abul on other.


		3.	Parliament.

R.A.B.	Business in week before Easter.

	Adjourn 30th March.

	
4.	Nationalised Industries.	[Enter P.M.G., R.W., Craigton

R.A.B.	Wh. Paper ready for presentation.

M.	Electricity industry wd. publicly disassociate themselves from 8% - second half of para.23 &amp; whole of para.24 cd. be omitted.

R.W.	Despite wishes of fuel industries, I think balance of advantage is on side of publn.  N.C.B. : para.32 will alter relationship which has grown up betwn. Ministers &amp; Bds.  That is main reason v. publn.  But we shan’t get ourselves straight with public opinion if we don’t publish.

R.M.	Publn. will mean pressure on Govt. to change price policy.

M.    x/.	Vagueness of ‘taking one ?? with another’ : that gives rise to need for publishing a statement.

E.M.	B.T.C. favour publn.  I suspect that cf. para.33, which wd. have it open to B.T.C. to do what they like.  V. dangerous.

S.L.I.	Plan was to publish on 11 or 12 April.  Time to reconsider.

R.W.	Some further definition of x/ is necessary.

P.M.	Last sentence of para.32.  

S.L.I.	Designed to help Boards.

D.E.	Para.32.  If you require business to make ends meet over 5 years
	you can’t interfere with prices etc.  Anyhow reasons for Govt. intervention have bn. mainly political – which no Govt. wd. want to publish.

	How much monopoly remains to warrant Govt. intervention on prices.
	They are in competn. – rlways with roads : power indies. with one another.  Better to give them control over price policy.

H.M.	But all save coal are inheritors of industries which were not free to control their price policy.

P.T.	Appln. to air corpns.  They wd. wish to buy U.S. aircraft : be released from social obligns. of service in Scotland : be relieved of increased charges at airports.

E.H.   x/.	If they reached 8% balances wd. be so large as to invite wage demands.

J.H.	Para.19 is attempt to guard v. that.

S.L.I.	I wd. be content to rest on para.30 and omit 32.

R.W.	If we set target for each industry, &amp; then ques. directions which make them imposs. to attain, we must make it plain we have done so.

P.M.	Sympathise with x/.  They shd. potter on slightly in red.

S.L.I.	But don’t forget immense investment we are putting in : we can’t afford to do that and allow them to make a loss.

	G.P.O. have adopted target of 8%.  That is only 50% of what private industry expect to make.

R.W.	8% for electricity wd. mean £90 m. p.a. – which would tempt E.T.U.

H.B.	Accept policy but dangerous to publish.

R.A.B.	Ready to omit last sentence of para.32.

P.M.	Amend para.24 as proposed by M. and omit last 2 sentences of 23.	Stop 32 short of last sentence.  Cab. to consider at further mtg. wthr. this shd. Be publd. as so amended.

							[Exit 3 above : enter J.P.


		5.	Cameroons.

I.M.	France will support C. Republic.  But, if we get thro’ U.N. debate, we shall have smooth hand-over in North, but diff. in south.

H.	French will be awkward : their line is tht. unless they support Republic up to hilt, R. will gain.  Means that relns. between France and Nigeria will be worsened.

S.L.I.	Sooner we can wind this up, the better.

J.P.	Ditto : want our forces out.

P.M.	Let Def. Cttee. see a plan for rapid w’drawal.  C.O. and W.O. to concert.
							[Exit J.P.

D.S.	Can’t get agreement with Union on all matters before 31/5.  Tempy. Bill requd.

H.	Problem of Territories is v. gt.  Can only be administered from S. Africa.  F.O. aren’t equipped for this.

D.S.	Doesn’t affect legn.

K.	Believe we cd. avoid repealing these sections of S. Africa Act – in law : tho’ awkward in politics.

P.M.	Avoid backdoor impression.  But many important matters to be settled.

	Shd. we say – to end of 1961 : or for 6 mos. with power to extend.
	On the whole prs. 31/3/62 wd. do. * Later : take 12 months from 31/5.

I.M.	Lines 13 etc.  These words can’t be omitted.  Because of law making powers of Colonies.

		Approve  :  subject to *.
