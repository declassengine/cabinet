  <content>C.C.39(41)							6th July 1961


		1.	Parliament.					[Enter M.R.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.

	
2.	Kuwait.

H.	Indicns. : Qassim unlikely to attack.  Pol. pressures mounting for our w’drawal, incldg. local pressures.  Feeling in Sec. Council is not bad : we mght. get sub Cttees. to consider what kind of force needed to guarantee K.s independence.

H.W.	Morale of our troops is good.  No. of heat casualties.
	Asked C.-in-C. to prepare plan for partial w’drawal to Bahrain.
	Aim : leave 1 battn. in K., if Ruler will keep his forces up to strength and stockpile arms.

S.L.I.	Don’t let Ruler build his forces up further : danger of revolution by its commander.  Stockpile with our key to cupboard.

	
3.	Laos.

H.	Princes to meet again in 2 wks.  They may shrink from responsibility of forming national Govt.  U.S. influencing Phonmi against joining Phonma because he is too much under Comm. influence.  True tht. Communists aren’t playing the game.

	Must try to keep Confce. going – tho’ it is v. difficult.

	
4.	Berlin.

H.	Replies to Soviet notes about to be sent.

R.A.B.	Public attitude must be firm : private based on commonsense.
	Complications of true posn. are not understood.

							[Enter C.


		5.	Nuclear Merchant Ship.

M.	Capital &amp; running costs much greater than conventional tanker.
	All agree we shd. not proceed with a ship.  But Dpts. want to continue r&amp;d – Admy. concurring.  Otherwise, as in memo.

S.L.I.	A.E.A. proposals for continuing research include only £150.000 p.a. on marine propulsion.  They therefore give it low priority.  I wd. like a little longer to judge : cd. decide some time later in July after consultn. with M/Science.

E.M.	Can I promise statement before recess – in a debate this week?

P.M.	Clear we shd. not build a ship, yet.
								[Exit C.
								[Enter E.Powell.

	
6.	Local Government : London.

H.B.	Local govt. in Ldn. is not healthy.  R. Commn. criticisms are sound.
	Problem not merely size of unit for jobs, but also lack of life in the personnel etc. of l. govt. in the area.

	Legn. not until 1962/3.  Early statement needed because uncertainty – affecting senior appointments of l.g. officials.  All falls into place administratively if we can settle size of boros.  They must have reality – theirs is main job.  R.C. recommended 50.
	Ready to agree 100,000 is too low a limit : 200/250.000 may well be wiser – tho’ 100.000 is qualifying no. for co. boro’ outside Ldn.  But not larger (1) therefore l.g. becomes too bureaucratic &amp; remote : whole purpose of change in Ldn. is to get away from that (L.C.C. and M’side).  (2) Opposn. to new groupings will be v. much stronger if we take larger units of 3-500.000.

	Propose therefore accept report in principle : suggest 200.000 as minimum size for boros. with special arrangements for educn.  Then no gt. diffy. in drawing memo. which cd. be presented as statement of Govt. policy.

D.E.	Educn. requires diff. organisation.  Don’t accept R.C. recommn. on educn. wh. contemplated policy with Greater Ldn. Council and execution with boros.  can’t have 2 tier basis for education.  What then shd. be size of single l.e.a.  Educn. tradition in Ldn. is to concentrate on higher educn. in centre because of good travel facilities : few primary schools in centre : &amp; no. of boros wh. ought not to be l.e.a.’s.
	I want to produce link betwn. secondary &amp; technical colleges comparable to existg. link betwn. grammar &amp; universities.  Campaign going on for this all over country.  Cdn’do it in Ldn. w’out larger units.

	I therefore propose i) central Ldn. authority covering about 1½ m. people : a joint Board of the l.e.a.’s  ii) joint Bd. l.e.a.’s between H.B.’s 40 or so boros.

	I can’t m’tain that L.C.C. is a bad l.c.a.  in the top quarter of all l.c.a.’s for efficiency.  We must be able to promise results at least as good, from a new system.

R.A.B.	What examples of failure of 2 tier system, save ????

D.E.	Wilts (Swindon) : Essex (Ilford etc.,) are not good.

H.W.	What is feeling among Home Counties?

H.B.	They have put up scheme to avoid losing any of their area.  But they wd. be quite viable under R.C. plan.  And no Dpt. favours Home Counties plan : which contemplates no more than advisory body for greater Ldn.  This certainly wdn’t do for transport or for planning.

E.M.	Support H.B. Ldn. traffic won’t be managed w’out strong central authy.
	Don’t want Dpt. to be that authy.

R.A.B.	Accept H.B.’s recommns.  Support plan of 40 boroughs.  A smaller no. of larger units wd. go away from all existg. boundaries.
	Education.  More difficult.  Joint Bd. basis in Ldn. is 90 years old.
		Shd. no central l.g. authy.  have some education function?  [Or shd. not 		his Joint Council at least sit with the main authy..]  Will it have enough 		powers w’out education?  Cd. it be responsible for educn. in central 		Ldn.?

D.E.	L.C.C. now control 16.000 teachers.  The new Ldn. area wd. comprise 43.000 teachers.  Wd. give them far too much power and influence.
Readier to look at one unit (1½ m) for educn. at centre of Ldn. where the bulk of the higher education goes on.

H.D.		That, however, wd. mean built in Socialist majority on that body.

I.M.	On balance, favour accepting Report.  But wd. prefer to take 52 units.  To go to 40 wd. exacerbate feeling.

Educn. : go for joint Boards on basis of 52 – as one exception from the package deal.  But fear tht. powers of G. Ldn. Council won’t be enough w’out educn. : cd. they prs. have higher education.

H.B.		52 or 40 is not fundamental for me.
Don’t think G. Ldn. Council will have too little to do.  If it has much more, only retired people or pros. will have time to serve on it.  Better to leave it w’out education.  Also more acceptable to outlying boros.

E.P.	Can do minimum of 200.000.  Don’t want it smaller.  Hope also we won’t make 250.000 a fixed maximum.  Variation in size is valuable.

H.B.	Final determination of new boundaries will require further machinery providing opportunities for local opinion to be taken.

Hail.		Adminn. chaos of dismantling County Hall as education authy.

K.	Impn. from debate in H/L.  R.C. report came thro’ well.  Little oppn. on behalf of home counties.  But heavy opinion v. Commn.’s report on education – dangerous to lose record of achievement of L.C.C.  More thought is needed on this.

Ch.H.		Youth employment service shd. go along with education.

H.B.	Can it be Agreed : 200.000 minimum for boros – 40 in principle : joint board system for educn.
		I can then work out a plan.

I.M.		Don’t decide against 52 boros.

E.P.		I cdn’t defend smaller units involved in 52.

H.B.		Don’t want final decision between 40 and 52.

		Agreed : Cttee. to consider  	(Rab in Chair)
				(Exit E.P.

7.	Covent Garden Market.			(Enter Waldegrave.

Agreed : try to put it back on Report.		[Exit W.

8.	South West Africa.

K.	U.N. decided (in abstaining) Cttee. shd. go to S.W. Afr.  Union refused visas.  Cttee. now want to go to Bechuanaland.  There are some people there who came fr. S.W.A. but 40 years ago.  We agreed to admit 9 : Union protested : we made it condition they wdn’t enter S.W.A. w’out leave of Union Govt.  They are now in Accru : we have asked them for assurance they will abide by condn.  They have declined reply : indicns. they will at least create incident on the border.  This might provoke disturbances.

Cttee. due to leave Salisb. for Bechuanaland on Saty.  Think we can’t give them facilities w’out assurance : must cancel arrangemts. made unless they give it.

H.		Will be difficult in U.N.  They will say tht. we are being obstructive.
Awkward choice.  But it is disputable manoeuvre.
