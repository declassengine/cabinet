  <content>C.C.32(61)							16th June 1961


		1.	Labour : Restrictive Practices.  [Enter Perth, Godber, M.R.

J.H.	What has bn. done to date.
	New alternatives i) Labour Practices Commission.  Legn.  Other diffies.
	Para.6.  Esp. lack of powers.
			   ii) Continue to examine by industry, one by one : follow up Adv. Cttee.’s work : ad hoc enquiries etc., paras. 7-8

P.M.	On i) Monopolies Commn. had no power : merely let light in.

P.T.	Restrictive Practices approach is preferable : reqn. followed by count.
	If, with labour, we cd. publish in a register what practices are, that wd. be v. helpful.

J.H.	Can be done in reports on particular industries.

R.M.	Some new initiative is needed.  Employers are being knocked about.
	Wd. prefer i).  Existg. methods don’t make enough impact.

J.H.	Individual approach only just started.  Hope we can give it time.

P.M.	If course i), don’t have a count : only means of letting light in.
	Choice therefore is between regularised machinery or ad hoc.

K.	M. Commn. was a failure.  Pure inquisitional body doesn’t suit Br. ethos  I wd. greatly prefer ii).

M.	Support ii).  Industrial relns. are being improved thereby.  i) mght. harm them.

S.L.I.	Prefer to note R.M.’s view but proceed with (ii).
		Discussion to be resumed.

	
2.	Economic Situation.

S.L.I..	Preliminary discn.

	i)	B/p. deteriorated last 2 yrs. &amp; again this year.
	Adverse balance £340 m. last year.  Drop of £210 m. in invisibles :
	soft loan aid increased by £100 m. :[mil. oversea expre. £50 m. &amp;direct grant aid is included in £210.]  W’falls : Ford &amp; G. debt repayment.  R.s.a. holdings dropped by £250 m.

	Central bankers have helped – drop therefore concealed – but now we are heavily in debt to the bankers.  This will carry us over June &amp; prs. July : but can’t continue.  Don’t want to draw on Fund &amp; use it all to pay off bankers.  They know tht. if £ goes, $ will too : they are therefore keen to hold £.  Their confidence in us is waning, however – living beyond our means etc.

	ii)	State of economy.  Licensed demand, labour force, investment but no 
	increase in prodn.  [R.M.  We have more capacity than labour : also effect of shorter working week.  J.H.  Suspicions of prodn. figures.  P.M. Report on this.]

	Forecast for ’62 : increase in demand, investment, no further drop in stocks : h.p. debt rising : unemploymt. dropping.

	These trends will cancel out the room for increased exports which we expected at Budget time.  Thus, boom.  Ought therefore to reduce demand – by at least £300 m. p.a.  Must consider effect of such action in increasg. industrial costs.

	iii)	Considered various alternatives open to us:- 

		a) Regulators.  Finance Bill can’t be thro’ H/L. before 20/7.
	At full extent wd. be 4d. on 20 cigs. &amp; corresp. amounts elsewhere producing £230 m. at maximum of 10%.  Wd. increase c/l. by 1½%. This cd. take effect at once.

		Second regulator cdn’t operate until Nov.  £200 m. gross at 4/= p. wk.  Direct increase in costs.

		First alone : but not second alone.

	b) Fiscal measures.  Bank rate : increase wd. have no effect externally.  Mght. have some psychol. effect at home : but not novel.  To be judged mainly on internal merits.

	H.P. rate.  Useful last year, but at expense of prodn. p’mmes of 3 big indies. – mistake to do it again.

	Bank advance.  Sp. deposit scheme or otherwise.  For a steady increase is going on.

	Generally, not much here – save Bank rate &amp; appeal to banks to restrict advances.

	c)	Govt. expenditure.  Capital investment : 58/9. 1470.  59/6 1575
	61/62 1763.  (130 up on last year) 62/63 bids up to 2.000.
	We shall have to look at that again – eg. restrict to 1600.

		Current expenditure : 10.000 m. 61/2.
	If this is to be contained unpleasant decns. – eg. education, hospitals to be cut back : agric. subsidies, defence to be held at present levels.
	We mustn’t say what we can’t do.  Nor in terms of propy. of g.n.p. which makes no impact.
		Expenditure overseas : more important in short term.  350 in ’58 now nearing 500.  Defence &amp; aid have risen substantially.  Distinction betwn. tied &amp; untied aid is important.  Time now to act.  Eg. in Germany we must set ceiling – low one, too : £25 m. – as target for next [a future] year.  Accords with W.E.U. oblign. because of b/p diffies.   Wd. force Allies to find means of paying for our troops.  Look again at £60 m. in F/E &amp; S.E.A.  Can’t longer rely on exports to produce surplus – must now reduce outgoings.  Also ceiling on untied aid – cf. the Cameroons.

	d)	Exchange Control.  Travel allowance : eg. £50 from 1/Nov. £20 m.
	legacies &amp; remittances : no money in it &amp; psych. damaging.

	e)	Import Control.  Have a plan wh. wd. save £150 m.  But how do you
	cure too much money chasing too few goods by reducing goods available – unless you have control over consumption.  Cumbersome, and slow to start operating.

	f)	Building controls.  Adminve. cost (300 at H.Q.) – forestalling (?)
	Can we check private bldg. : show public by other means.  
	Eg. higher deposits by bldg. societies : planning control delays.
	There is a certain overload on this industry, resultg. in inefficiency.
	Tho’ signs of shift, in mid. investment. fr,. bldg. to plant.

	g)	Remittances from overseas.  We invest abroad, but yield from it is not 
	increasing.  Cases where cos. have not remitted, tho’ at liberty to do it.  B/E. are considering this – fear little money in it.

	iv)	Positive Action.
	T.U.C. suggest we shd. take risks.  Believe we are – eg. investment allowances not reduced.

	Unilateral tariff redns.
	Savings : long term eg. for house on marriage.
	More central planning – possibly on advisory basis, as in France.
	Check wage increases.

R.A.B.	B/p. is v. dangerous.  Can’t allow to continue.  Disappearance of invisible earnings.  V. dang. in summer.

	Effect on £ - psychol. as well as physical.  Foreign fear we aren’t competitive.  Confidence.

	If economy, esp. b/p. deteriorates our political stock will slump.
	Need therefore for drastic action before recess.  Avoid autumn budget.
	Regulator, happily, is available.  Use it all end/July, with one or two other things incldg. oversea expenditure &amp; assurance of future limit on Govt. expenditure.  Bldg. : what we need is control over starts.  Import controls : wd. like to see plan.

P.T.	V. disappointing after such a large surplus on Budget.  Odd there shd. be lack of confidence.  Underlying pressures have bn. too strong – not only Govt. expre. : pressure of increased wages &amp; salaries.  No sense therefore in cutting £300 m. if it is to be thrown away in higher wages.

	I wd. favour 1 regulator : increased public expenditure to be w’in increase in prodn. : rejection of an important wage claim.
	Better than mosaic of minor measures.

R.M.	Believe posn. will improve – b/trade certainly.  Prodn. will rise &amp; exports will expand.

	Use 1st regulator at maximum soon.

	But will look ‘same again’.  Fear we can’t expand economy and m’tain exchange at $2.80.  W’out radical change in outlook of employers &amp; men.  Consider floating rate.  Can’t reconcile our comfort at home with responsibilities of £ abroad.

M.	Exports won’t be increased by restrictions at home if, as I believe, cause is rising costs.  On contrary anythg. we do to increase costs will damage exports.  Real need is to curb wage increases.

	Remittances from abroad – agree shd. be considered.
	Increase in “undesirable” imports – consumer goods.
	A few simple measures better than a mosaic.
	Need for quick action.

Hail.	B/p. deficit of £350 m.  This is what we pay abroad in defence and aid.
	We ought, if that can’t be abolished, to limit other outgoings.  Eg. oversea investment : free export of capital not compatible with our f. policy.

	The economy : B. rate + h.p. worked last time.  Why prefer the regulators : The second wdn’t work.
	But agree – urgent action.

H.W.	Need for shock at home.  Restrict next round of wage increases.
	Top priority for that.  Eg. let teachers strike rather than give more pay.  Shan’t be thought to be in earnest if we don’t tackle wages.
	Defence overseas : £230 rising to £270.  Trying to cut to £200 m.
	Wd. mean leaving H.Kong and reducing in S.E.A.  But N.A.T.O. is much more diff.  Reducing. troops or f’casting it now is hardly on in view of Berlin.  Consider blocked arrangemts. for payment.  This is kind of decn. we shd. have to take.

Godb.	These suggns. raised v. big issues of f. policy – esp. when we are accused of being “soft” on Berlin.
	
 
J.M.	Agree on need for apparent and firm action.
	Wd. deprecate 2nd regulator &amp; plain addn. to costs.

J.H.	Agree with R.M. tht. expansion of prodn. is beginning – also tht. more export consciousness will produce more exports before long.
	Don’t overlook opinion overseas wh. believes expansion, not restriction, is right answer.

	Wage restraint.  Diff. h’to because profits so high.  They are now dropping.  On next round this will influence employers, who cd. be influenced too by Govt. action July.  All v. well to talk of firmness : but an engineering strike wd. seriously damage whole economy.  Don’t plan for a strike (H.W.) : we shd. have to run away from it in end.

Ch.H.	New thought needed on wages.  Govt. has not influenced private sector in this: correct means have failed : consider whr. Govt. shd. not take public posn. v standstill.  Hail : Parallel line on profits?

P.	We have bn. spending more on O.C.S. – but much of it spent here.
	H.Kong : must consider as a whole (incldg. textiles, C. Market) to see wthr. we can get increased def. contn.

	Aren’t profits rising, on long term?  Wage increases matched by prior increases.  What about tariff redns. via import restns.
	Industry has had it too easy.  Remedies wd. be classic.

Hail.	Free movement of capital – hedging investment in C. Market countries.  Can it be right to allow this and spend on N.A.T.O.

K.	Recently too frightened of exhortation.  We must now explain &amp; encourage : as we have recently done on exports.

	Four basic needs : more selection for capital investment : restraint in wages &amp; profits : increases productivity &amp; improved industrial practices : [no fourth stated].

C.S.	If we use 1st regulator, we can’t allow effect to be whittled away by wage increases.

	N.A.T.O.  This isn’t reducg. effort propn. to n. income : it is solely a ques. of cost across exchanges.  Not imposs. to find agreed solution to that : wthr. blocked money or otherwise.

	Worried about redn. in F/E.  Greater danger to W. world now is outside Europe.  Can we be weaker in S.E.A. - Laos eg.

P.M.	Situation serious because unexpected &amp; alarming changes - invisibles : defence and aid £500 m. yet lectured by those who do nothing on how to run our economy : liquidated Empire &amp; pay out to new countries where we previously received help (eg. Indian Army) : must reduce this burden.

	At home, we assumed we cd. return to normalcy.  Had we the powers we used to hold, we cd. limit imports.

	Short term : we shall get thro’ because central banks must see us thro’.
	But long term, if we can’t rely on invisibles, greater changes will be needed.

	Mil. expre. : must make it plain tht. payment over exchanges for troops in G. can’t continue indefinitely.

	Attitude of govt.: must be cheerful but firm.  Hardest problem – wages, esp. when home demand is buoyant.  Also, our own record on p. service wages is v. bad : largely because our control is incomplete.  Change of legn. re teachers’ salaries mght. be helpful fr. this angle.

	No more limited loans to less developed.
