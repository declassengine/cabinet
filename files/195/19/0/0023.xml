C.C.61(60)							1st December 1960


		1.	Parliament.					[Enter M.R.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.


		2.	Foreign Affairs.

H.	a)	Egypt.  Dipl. recognition.  We shall have to offer one E. Consul
	in E. Africa if we are to get Ambassador in Cairo.

I.M.	Easiest wd. be Tanganyika.  Am consulting Nigeria.

H.	b)	Congo.  Lumumba has escaped thro’ incompetence of Congolese
	and impartiality of U.N. Forces.  Likely to try to establish alternative Govt. in Stanleyville.  A new complication.

	c)	W.E.U. Assembly.  Resolution passed is helpful to us, on the whole.
	Urged negotiations to expedite negotns. enabling U.K. to join Community on terms acceptable to us.  Includes words “taking a/c of U.K. obligns. to members of E.F.T.A. and of C’wealth”.  We shd. be able to explain it.

							[Enter R.W.


		3.	Nationalised Industries : Salaries of Board Members.

M.	No need for action v part time members.  Full time members Offl. Cttee. recommended reference to Coleraine &amp; parcel of business men.  We disliked both these recommns.

	Simple solution – publish only total remuneration of a Board.  Political diffies. in this : therefore suggest we explore it with Govt. supporters.

S.Ll.	Is it realistic to suppose we can conceal salaries.  Wd. cause more trouble than disclosing a higher salary.

R.A.B.	No hope of being able to conceal this.

Hail.	Wd. be impossible to conceal salaries of A.E.A. members – because Vote borne : &amp; they wd. give clue to the salaries of other Boards.

P.T.	Worth exploring.  Might even be supported by Opposition.

Hail.	We can’t accustom public to high slaries w’out disclosing them.

D.E.	Isn’t it real money they want?  
R.M.	Not altogether : salary effects pensions.

R.W.	Even if Parly. diffy. cd. be overcome, it wd. be impossible to keep this secret among natd. industries – and that wd. lead to hard feelings and jealousies between the industries.

I.M.	Believe Party wd. accept need for higher salaries – tho’ not for secrecy.
	Prefer to face diffy. of differentiating publicly.

J.H.	Cttee. are in favour of paying rate for the job – or the man.

P.M.      x.	Then do it ad hoc., and don’t try to conceal it.
	Start with the new B.T.C. appointments.

	Agreed – as at x/.

	
4.	British Transport Commission.

E.M.	Timetable (in reply to S.Ll.) was determined by Ch.Whip’s desire to have debate before Xmas.  I wd. prefer to take longer &amp; get it right.

S.Ll.	I feel this v. strongly : we need another week to improve draft esp. on financial passages.

M.R.	Wd. be useful to have stimulus for another debate before Xmas.

P.M.	Useful to publish before Xmas – and get public opinion interested – and then have debates after Xmas.

M.	Wd. be easier to have more time to discuss with B.T.C. and T.U.’s.

R.A.B.   *	Best to present in last week before Xmas.		Agreed.

M.	Debate in H/L. on 8/12 – Ld. Morrison : can’t be deterred.

Hail.	He intends to make mischief.  We shall have to put up a strong Govt. reply.

P.M.	Para.2.  We don’t propose to publish Stedeford Report.  Better start by stating Govt.’s responsibility.  Prs. also put it later – less challenging.

	Firm Cab. decision tht. Stedeford Report shd. not be published.

Hail.	Finance is crux of problem.  Better to put it, briefly, in introductory part of W. Paper.

P.M.	Paras.3-10 cd. be re-cast in more a stringent form – striking the note of a new deal, prs. on lines of my statement in H/C.
	
P.T. 	Agree : &amp; bring in the point tht. nos. employed are too large.

P.M.	Para.11.  Point of principle.  

E.M. 	Must go in, to assure T.U.’s 

P.M.	Stress practical, not doctrinaire, approach : thus is a natd. industry &amp; we seek to make it work as well as possible.
	Para.22.  Insert a general description before detail.
	Para.24.  Put reference to general managers first – in addn. other members.  To stress fact tht. these are the men who run the rlways vice “represented”.

R.M.	Para.23.  Rlway w’shops shd. not have freedom to manufacture otherwise than for rlways.  We shall want to limit scope of their activities.

D.E.	Paras.22-4 imply tht. the real power will rest with central Board : the regional boards will not in fact have much of a show.

E.M.	Want to give regional boards full power in all matters save those truly belonging to centre &amp; I have words to that effect.

P.M.	Para.32.  Powers will be needed, in Bill, to transfer properties.

D.E.	Para.34.  Shd. users be rep?. only on the Council.  Wd. they not be more useful on the Boards themselves.

E.M.	There will be part time members on the Regional Boards.

D.E.	Need for them also on central Boards.

E.M.	Not on Rlway Bd.  

P.M.	Agree.  But they cd. be added to the other central Boards.

P.M.	Para.35.  On this Stedeford Group was divided.  View of Ministers was tht. politically it wd. be v. bad to have a strong executive Council.  Decided therefore that it shd. be advisory.  On that basis better to leave it for Ministers to convene it.  Further, don’t give it same initials B.T.C. – eg. Nationalised Transport Advisory Council.

J.H.	Believe we may have to pay price of having repve. of organised labour, not only on Council, but on Regional &amp; central Rlway Boards.
	Better to have a general para. on lines of provisions in nationalision. Acts – viz., not in terms of T.U. leaders.

	Organised labour is at present represented throughout the structure.

P.M.	Let us have memo. stating what posns. they now hold.

R.W.	Advisory Council to advise Minister on co-ordinn. between various bodies.  Will provoke pressure for similar Council to advise on co-ordinn. between my industries.  Wd. it not be better to leave this to Minister, to deal with it ambulando.

H.B.	May this Council not become a mere formality.

H.W.	Does this give M/T. responsibility to Parlt. for daily operation of the rlways.

M.	Minister needs a buffer.  

E.M.	Also a place for organised labour.  And meets labour nostalgia for B.T.C.

	In further discussions, doubts expressed about functions of Council.

H.B.	On major disputes between the central boards Minister can’t escape responsibility.

I.M.	Wage negotiation sh. be kept away from Council. Then Minister cd. be its Chairman.

D.E.	Better to have no-one on Council save Chairmen of the Boards plus Minister.  And let labour be repd. at a lower level.

P.T.	In that event no need to formalise it at all.

P.M.	Can you face that – when we are abolishing B.T.C.  This was designed as compromise.

P.M.	Minister in Chair?  

M.	Need for independent advice.

H.B.	Powerful move in this posn. wd. make life v. diff. for Minister.

P.M.	If you can find a good man, he cd. be Vice Chairman.

		Agreed : leave this over for final decision later.

P.M.	Paras.59-61.  Take note of importance of this decision on fares.

S.Ll.	Financial deal.  Accept substance.  Wish to consider presentation.

S.Ll.	Para.54.  Shd. this not be strengthened?  

E.M. 	Yes : have words.

J.H.	Is it wise to jump this hurdle too soon?  Don’t be too alarmist.

M.	Be cautious : don’t provoke T.U. opposn. to plan as a whole.

P.M.	Prs. add a final para. summing up &amp; incldg. reference to need for management &amp; men to work together to make efficient industry – sacrifices all round (incldg. by taxpayer, on writing off the deficit.)

							[Exit R.W.
