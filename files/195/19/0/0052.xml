  <content>C.C.34(61)							20th June 1961


		1.	National Theatre.				[Enter M.R.

S.L.I.	Deputn. : L.C.C. + interests if Ty. will put up £1 m. we will pay rest of cost of bldg.

	Running costs: no further Govt. contn. beyond promised.
	Components : S. Wells : Old Vic : Stratford : promised total of £400.000.

	Parlt. in effect passed the £1 m. in ’49.  Wd. like to promise that.
	Ty. assistce. to running costs will be limited as above.
	We must be allowed to approve scheme and be repd. on Bd.
	Advantage : gets L.C.C. involved.  Otherwise we shall also be b’mailed into giving more to Old Vic &amp; Stratford.
	Gives chance also of keeping Govt. out of details.

H.B.	Will L.C.C. be content indefinitely to meet mounting deficits w’out asking Govt. for more?

S.L.I.	Better prospect of getting private money on this plan.  And as mine I shd. be under pressure to give more to Old Vic etc. separately.

C.S.	Condn. that all 3 shd. join?  

S.L.I.	Strong pressure for that via absolute condn.

M.	Thought we were v. concept of N. Theatre
	Also? consistent with attitude v economy &amp; likely action on that.

S.L.I..	No bldg. for 18 months at least.

D.E.	Might increase appetites elsewhere – Co. boros.

H.B.	Project now for national theatre in Cardiff.

J.M.	Also demand for new hall in Edinburgh.

S.H.	On timing : I cd. avoid saying yes : merely say I’m not saying no – let me see a scheme.

P.M.	Better to do this behind the scenes – no announcement.

		Agreed : put it back into Chandos’ court.

	
2.	Federation of Rhodesia.				[Enter E.H.

		Draft telegram to R.W. tables.

K.	Had not realised double member constituency wd. increase minimum no. to 400.

	Greenfield may think this too high – he spoke of 100.
	Wd. it be better to reduce to 10% (Via 12½%) giving 300.

I.M.	400 will be hard to defend in H/C. gt. advantage to Europeans.
	Wd. prefer to reduce %age.  Favour 10% or 400.  The number 300 is only 3% of Africans.

D.S.	If you reduce to 10% number shd. also go down.  10% or 300.

E.H.	Good case for 10%. For Europeans reliance on no. and 400 is as low as Moffatt wd. go.

Hail.	Between 300 and 400 is matter for negotiation, not a matter on which he will decline altogether.

P.M.	Agree : not an issue which will decide him to come here.  That is the 60/40 and 50/50.  Don’t make concession now on the detail.

R.A.B.	Re-arrange.  Paras. 1: 5-11 : 12 then 3 : 2.

H.	No chance on this of any alternative – esp. if para.3 included – unless some middle roll solution is taken to be w’in W. Paper.
	May have trouble in Laos and over Berlin.  Can’t afford to break with R.W. on this.  I wd. be willing to consider 5 : 4 : or equalisation of races on middle roll – as w’in Wh. Paper.

	Agreement reached on amended text.

	
3.	East/West Relations.

H.	R. not interested in negotn. with West.  Laos Tests etc.
	Tests Confce. will go on in skeleton form, but no reality.
	Laos : if Princes agree, may be progress.  But Troika principle is being introduced there also.  If Conf. fails, &amp; fighting recurs, no alternative but S.E.A.T.O. intervention.		Berlin.  R. losing interest in negotiated settlement.  Looks as tho’ K.
	will make his treaty in Oct.

P.M.	Change of mood in U.S.
