  <content>C.C.30(61)								6th June 1961
				

1.	Parliament.					[Enter M.R.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.

	
2.	Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland.

D.S.	When I went out to S. last week, temperature was high – R.W. seemed to be threatening Election on anti U.K. platform.

	S. Rhodesia constitution – all going smoothly.  Means we shall surrender reserve powers.  But alternative s’guards will be more effective – bill of rights : constitutional council to pass on any discriminatory laws : tho’ Parlt. can then override advice of council issue will be open to challenge in courts.  Africans are really satisfied – tho’ they won’t say so.  There will be row over land : tho’ this is false issue for constitution can’t itself be declaration of policy.  Importance of referendum.

	N. Rhodesia.  Govr. is now trying to sell his proposals to repves. of Parties.  But hope : no agreement or violent dispute – then U.K. imposed solution.

	
3.	Teachers’ Salaries.

D.E.	Teachers’ H.Q. Executive rejected settlement accepted by their repves. on Burnham Cttee.  On 17/6 this goes to full national executive for further instructions : not certain tht. view of H.Q. executive will be confirmed.

	Case for the 16% has not bn. well presented.  Can’t work for better understanding unless I can promise l.a.’s tht. Govt. wd. accept this award.

S.L.I.	Difficulty because Anglo/Sc. relationship in this …….
	Suggest further meeting tomorrow.

		S.L.I, D.E. and J.M. (with J.H.) to concert a plan.

	
4.	British Sugar Corporation.

C.S.	Put our plan to industry – reasonable reception : but apprehensive of acting w’out acquiescence of private shareholders, &amp; won’t give definite view w’out knowing their opinion.  Trouble : only organisation existing is not repve.

	We can either i) consult that organisation, in confidence : &amp; say tht. 		is all we can do.  Bd. favour that.  So do I.
			ii) Summon mtg. of private shareholders &amp;let Bd. put 		our plan (as theirs) to them.  Publicity wd. be awkward.
			iii) Tell Bd. that, as we can’t get concent, we will stand 		pat on existing arrangemts – 7%.  Wd. be expensive.

Hail.	Better to do nothing : and pay no more.  They get 7% : that is enough.

M.	We shd. try to get out of this muddle.  Prefer (i).

S.L.I.	Have some shares : have therefore taken no part.

Hail.	The Cttee. are bound to leak, if consulted.

C.S.	Not sure : they have kept silence when consulted h’to.

P.M.    x/	Do (i) as plan of Bd. – if Govt. decided this, wd. you accept it?

C.S.	They cd. do it on that basis.

			Agreed – proceed with (i) on basis of x/.

	
5.	Civil Service : Unestablished Service.	[Enter P.M.G.

S.L.I.	Not merely £6 or £7 m. a year.  Wd. repercuss  on natd. industies. etc.  Thus, on merits, favour taking no action.

	Diffy. – terms of motion only ask for Whitley discussion;  but if I agree to that, I shall be deemed to accept principle.

	But if I decline, we shall have debate &amp; over 130 Tories have supported motion.

	I might offer discn. on basis tht. I’m prepared only to consider minor adjustment.  If it broke down, I wd. have some posn. with our supporters and might get them off the hook.

	In debate, they (H/C.) can’t do anything.
	Hope we can stand on merits : how then do I handle them?

M.R.	Put the diffies. to Tories who have signed motion.  They can be persuaded.

E.H.	Cd. you not settle on basis of future payments only.

P.M.G.	⅓rd. of cost wd. be on G.P.O.  Cost £3-3½ m. which wd. have to be passed on to consumer.

J.H.	V. dangerous to give further recognition to “retrospection”.

M.R.	Awkward in H/C., but we cd. handle it.  Opportunities for debate are not v. embarrassing.

P.T.	If we are to stand pat, much to be said for S.L.I.’s suggn. – wd. help our supporters off the hook.

E.M.	V. awkward repercussions on rlways.

M.R.	Wd. sooner stand firm &amp; put the case for doing nothing, first to Tory sponsors of motion &amp; then to 1922.

R.A.B.	I agree.  Prefer to stand on the principle.  Cost to taxpayer : &amp; repercussions.

H.W.	Wd. start avalanche, incldg. Armed Forces.

		Agreed – as proposed by M.R.

	
6.	Mr. Kennedy’s Visit.

P.M.	Mr. K.’s preference for private discussions.  For last ¾ hour only H. was present to discuss Berlin.

	Mr. K. glad to have met K. because better understanding of adversary.
	But unsatisf. R. more confident &amp; tougher.  He found no “ques.” except prs. on Laos.  Professed to have no interest in Laos.

	Aide memoire on Berlin.  V. slight change of approach discerned by our experts, but not visible to me.  K. unlikely to make public reference to this until Party congress after G. elections.

	Tests.  They evidently don’t want agreement.  Suggest it be swept up into general disarmament.  No inspn. w’out [agreement to] full disarmament.

	What shd. attitude of Alliance be in face of unyielding R. stand?
	Mr. K. is uneasy about G. – selfish : imbalance (Mr. K. will pursue).
	Mtg. in Paris.  de G. gave v. little.  Mr. K. wd. go long way to meet him on Tripartism if de G. wd. offer any contn. himself.

	Tho’ wants it covert.  Also concessions on techn. aspects of delivery of nuclear, tho’ not on nuclear itself – both bombers &amp; re-entry of missiles.  de G. will p’pone his demands for N.A.T.O. re-organisation – notionally because of Berlin, but actually until after Algeria.

	Six and Seven : de G. gave merely formal reply – C’wealth etc.
	Political diffies. for us, de G.suggd. wd. be greater than economies.
	Mr. K. concluded from this tht. de G. doesn’t want us in.
	de G. made it clear tht. he considers Europe as appendixes of France.
	de G. railed over his treatment by F.D.R. &amp; W.S.C. in war – the former even more than the latter.

	Mr. K. rates him therefore as bad Ally and a nuisance.  Writing off both F. &amp; G.  Relief to be in Ldn.  Impressed by risk tht. de G wd. accept anything offered and give nothing.
	Our relations with him will be good.
								[Exit H.W.

	
7.	Berlin.

H.	Mr. K. agreed tht. in his speech, less said the better.
	K.’s plan for Berlin is v. plausible – eg. contact with outside world shd. be unobstructed : free city with free access : people free to decide their future : demilitarised, but guaranteed by token forces incldg. neutrals &amp; U.N. presence.

	We must therefore have negotiating posn. to put fwd. after G. elections.
	U.K., U.S. &amp; France are to try to find one.

	Alternative : allow K. to make Treaty with D.D.R. &amp; hope that R. wd. compel them to allow access to Berlin.  Wait &amp; re-act to any interference.

	Everyone now seems to agree tht. we shd. not re-act to anything short of physical interference with supplies.

D.S.	I find K.’s proposals attractive – better than war.

P.M.	Don’t want U.K. to be the first to run out.
	But remember tht. this is only place where R. are not winning.
	That is why K. wants to liquidate it.  We want it therefore to remain.  

H. 	[Germany can’t survive the leakage at present rate of 1 m. p.a.]

	New posn. is tht. Mr. K. is willing to contemplate negotiations.

S.L.I.	Why doesn’t K. make treaty with D.D.R.?  Must be because it doesn’t suit him.

	
8.	Angola.

H.	P. attitude v. rigid.  “Africans in A. are Portuguese before Africans”.
	Wdn’t listen to my view of progress twds. independence etc.
	V. slow in bringing out their p’mme of reforms.
	Will they bring up a p’mme acceptable to U.S. &amp; will they do it in time.

	Resoln. in U.N. tonight.
	Exercises : frigates visiting : Army exercises in P.
	Neutrals will say we are training P. to put down Africans.
	Believe we may have to cancel these.
	But, if we shame them publicly, they may line up with S. Africa or there may be change of regime in P. – either more right or collapse to left.

	Prs. we can abstain tonight – saying P. shd. have time to formulate liberal policies.

D.S.	Hope we can cancel exercises.  V. unfavourable impn. in Africa &amp; C’wealth neutrals.

	Hope we can also vote for resoln.

H.	Ghana’s hands are not clean in this.

P.M.	How will Australia vote?  

H. 	Not on Sec. Council.

P.M.	Don’t want to support P. when we have stopped supporting S. Afr.
	V. awkward pol. position.

H.	Not parallel – no colour bar in A.

D.S.	But we are at risk of losing sympathy of African friends.
