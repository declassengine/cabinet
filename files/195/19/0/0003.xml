C.C. 33(60).								26th May 1960


		1.	Parliament.				[Enter M.R.

R.A.B.	Business for next week. Whitsun recess : will end Monday 20th, vice Tuesday. 


2.	Foreign Affairs.
a)	Security Council: Post-Summit Moves.

S.L1.	Compromise resln. is likely to go thro’.  If R. veto that, I doubt if they will get mtg. of G. Assembly.  
	Nuclear Tests Confce.  Hope we can press on.  Shall ascertain W’ton intentions when I go there.  
	Disarmament Confce.  Inclined to favour adjournment at end/June if evident tht. no serious business will be done.  Must avoid any appearance that we broke it off.

H.	Unwise to break off contacts, if we can avoid it.

P.M.	Easier to adjourn that if we have reached agreement on Tests.

S.L1.	But v. Dangerous if U.S. came out with negative attitude.  

P.M.	Or carry on quietly if W. Posn. is solid.  Adjourn if that is only way of avoiding disclosure of divisions in W. camp.

S.L1.	Tripartite discussions.  U.S. have responded.  Suggest first mtg. next week in W’ton, with an agenda.  This is good.


3.	Indonesia.

P.M.	Disccused with Menzies – who has given me a free hand.  But some developments in sitn. : and we shd. re-consider timing.  
	Shackletons : not a v. serious weapon of war.  Destroyers are such.

S.L1.	Dutch decn. on carrier &amp;reinforcements has stirred up feeling.  Wrong moment to send supplies to the other side.  Need time also to prepare ground with the Dutch, over the Shackletons.  
	Also possibility tht. Dutch may buy some Shackeltons.  They wdn’t pursue that if we sold to Indonesia.

D.S.	F. affairs interest must prevail over this.

P.M.	Inclined to go on, steadily, with Shackletons : delay on destroyers.

		Agreed: 1) Prepare Dutch for eventual sale of Shackletons.

F.E	Doing quite a bit of trade – and getting paid.

H.A.	They have enormous commercial debt.  No grds. for extended credit.

H.A.	We are sending off enough exports w’out payment.  Shd. do no more.  Suggest para. 4 be considered by E.P.C.
									[Enter J. Rodgers


4.	Industrial Relations.

E.H.	Time is ripe for this move.  
	Method : start with large mtg. under P.M. or begin quietly in small groups.  Favour first method – breaking down into groups thereafter.  Risk : flop if nothing happens.  But other method doesn’t, on experience, make headway.  
	Subjects : apprenticeship : collective bargaining : status and redundancy : individual liberties : machinery of consultn.  (N.J.A.C.I. etc.,)  Avoid direct appeal for wage restraint at outset.  
	Hope that something may come of it.

H.A.	Accept need, and agree time is ripe.  Doubtful of [method] subjects suggested.  Our real pre-occuptn. is with wages : to avoid inflation.  Must have this as b’ground for all these discns. : for w’in months believe we may have to take anti-inflationary action.  
	What is our aim? Something big? Or series of small advances on various subjects?  Do we want strong combination of workers and employers.  
	M/L. plan seems designed to steer talks away fr. main problem of wages &amp; profits.  
	At a large mtg I cd. say nothing new if I avoid that topic.  Shd. we not tackle wage negotn. &amp; arbitration machinery?  
	Fear an anti-climax if we favour method I.  If these are the subjects, I wd. favour method II.

I.M.	That is a v. narrow view.  Issues are much wider than wages.  
	Our last attempt failed just because we concentrated on wage restraint.  That would fail again.  
	My preference wd. be to go even wider than E.H. suggests.  Have a mtg. with P.M. on the v. big issues – e.g. Sixes &amp; Sevens : automation – apprenticeship.

H.W.	Only P.M. cd. start this off.  Begin on a broad base.  On method II it will run into sand.

M.	Subjects are v. important.  The 3 ques suggested by E.H. are not wide enough.  Who shd. attend?  Large as proposed : fear you may have to make it even wider – e.g. Productivity Council or natd. indies.

R.A.B.	Revert to industrial charter – we haven’t followed it up.  
	Objectives : economic exchange of view.  Can be achieved.  Machinery of wage negotn. : can’t get anything on that : do we know what we want?  Are we going to try to inject public interest into collective bargaining.
	Individual liberty w’in T.U.’s.  Tory Party are keen on this.  Will you get Labour to take this, &amp; W. Charter, seriously if we get them involved in wider economic issues.  
	Favour action on contract of service.  Wd. be interesting legn.  
	We ought also to have a plan on individual liberty.  
	What I wd. do is open on economics to get their confidence, but have a definite plan for gaining our objectives on W. Charter points.

E.H.	Machinery of wage negotn. : employers will certainly raise that.

J.M.	Sc. problems?  We are behind in industrial relns.  Shall we regionalise?

E.H.	Not intended.  Divide by industry, perhaps, but not regions.

D.E.	V. large body seems to be envisaged.  Better to approach them thro’ specific problems e.g. apprenticeship.

K.	On contrary, prefer to go from general to particular.  Set the practical ques v. that background.  Support E.H. plan.

J.H.	I agree.  Need for co-ordinn. between examinations of separate problems – includg. examination by outside bodies which are tackling these ques separately.

H.A.	V. well.  But don’t start unprepared.  We need more plans, on the particular ques, so tht. we can follow up the general approach w’out loss of impetus.

M.	Agree.  A.E.’s talks petered out – mainly because Govt. didn’t know what they wanted.

J.R.	Time is propitious but existg. organisations cover most of the problems.  Shd. these be energised and/or re-shaped to smaller steps to make more headway.  Wrong to start, by either method, until we know what we want.  Wd. also prefer method II.

P.M.	Useful discn.  Agreed tht. time is ripe for action.  But not clear what we shd. do &amp; how.  Mtg. will be large and formal.  If we discuss the large economic issues, clear tht. neither us nor they know the answers.  Any point in discussing them beyond indicatg. diff. posn. in wh. UK, must operate?  Then pose practical problems – how can our industrial structure be made happy &amp; efficient.  And get down to these, in groups : the human &amp; technical problems.

H.A.	O.K. if we knew in advance tht. they wd. play on study groups.

P.M.	Reflect further, in light of discn.
x  | 	M/L to draw up practical plan of campaign and submit it to P.M. –
    |	identifying end products.

P.M.	This wd. mean by-passing N.J.A.C. and N.P.A.C.I.?

I.M.	Yes : because nothing comes out of those bodies.

H.A.	Favour P.M. mtg if M/L.can ascertain in advance tht. both sides are ready to do some serious work on practical problems.

		Agreed as at x/.
				[Exit Erroll, J.R.

5.	South Africa: Refugees in High Commission Territories.
				[Enter Att.G.
H.	No diffies. re residence permits.  
	Travel documents.  Union nervous of escape route via Territories.  Might re-act.  Propose to dribble a few out, quietly, even tho’ they are Communists.  Ghana, however, are trying to create escape route – to make trouble for Union : and running idea of Ghana travel document.  They are now exporting these people by aircraft to Congo : &amp; Union may be led to demanding return under F. Offenders Act.  Shall try to persuade Ghana not to repeat aircraft operation.

K.	Policy proposed seems sound.  Applns. under F.O. Act cd. be drawn out by legal arguments, to allow tempers to cool.

Att.G.	Para. 14(a). Don’t refer publicly to amending O-in-C.

H.	No : this is only advance warning.

P.M.	But let us prepare a draft.
