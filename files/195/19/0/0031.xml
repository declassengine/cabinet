		1.	Industrial Disputes : Tally Clerks.		[Enter M.R.

J.H.	Cousins seen : will go back on his original assurance.  Stevedores Union have also threatened strike if plan goes ahead.  Cousins has bn. idle, not malicious.  Seeing his regional offls. now : but unlikely to change.

	We have no power to direct Bd.  Nat. Bd. unlikely to direct Ldn. Bd. to go ahead.  Employers won’t risk strike if it’s officially supported.  We came into this only in support of employers.

	Unfortunate.  But some gain.  Unions have conceded to Bd. right to permit addl. tally clerks.  They have 200 more this year than last.

P.M.	We were ready to risk unoffl. strikes.  Risk of offl. strike is difft. matter.

E.M.	Enquiry into docks generally may give us chance to have another go at this.

		Agreed  -  no action.

	
2.	Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland.

P.M.	During past week revival mtgs. of Africa Cttee.
	V. diff. situation.  African parties press for clear majority in Leg. Co. &amp; manhood suffrage. U.F.P. boycotting Conference, are opposed to any major change – certainly to party.  Realities : growth in national consciousness &amp; world support for it/other hand, gt. security risks (either way).  Threatened secession of S Rhodesia, or decln. of Fedn. to be independent.

	No need for Cab. to follow numerous variants considered.
	New plan evolved – put to Welensky in C.R.O. Tel. 278 of 11/2.
	Leg. Co. so balanced tht. ⅓rd. upper roll (broadly Europns) ⅓rd on lower roll (Africans) and ⅓rd. elected on principle tht. it cd. not expect election save by appeal to moderate opinion (votes from both polls, averaged out with minor votes discounted).  This provision wd. eventually moderate extremity of appeal on first &amp; second ⅓rd. – wdn’t be separate Parties for 3rd ⅓rd. 

	Importance of European views.  W. is P.M. of whole Federation.  Wh. has referendum which is of v. gt. importance.

	Africans will be disappointed – they were hoping for majority, at least among elected members.

	Advantage of new plan is that it contains compulsions twds. multi.racial attitudes.
	Details to be worked out.  Possibility, too, of introducg. in N.Rhodesia a Bill of rights on S. Rhodesian model.

	Wel. has put fwd. alternatives – unacceptable because contemplates permanent Europn. majority.

D.S.	Wel. has come round to view tht. provided we don’t compel him to contemplate scheme involving African majority or parity, he is ready to accept some solution.  He has w’drawn his alternative plan &amp; is working on Whitehead to accept our line.  Wh.’s  trouble is his referendum – all our conclns. on S. Rhod. constitution are subject to it.  Expecting to hear from him during this morning.

K.	Great dangers.  a) European reaction v. this plan.  b) If Wh. lost his referendum, Harpes regime in S. Rhodesia wd. lead to even greater blood shed.  But, despite risks, this plan is defensible because it is just.
	Devaluation of lower roll votes eventually equalises value of the two rolls because lower roll is equally more numerous.  As our policy has bn. based on multi racialism, this is consistent ground on which to stand.  A certain propn. of votes on each roll is a condn. of election.  With progress there will be growing no. of Africans on upper roll.  Moreover, on this basis no one can say there will be a majority of Europeans or of Africans.

	To concede African majority wd lead to Europn. re.actions wh., on balance, wd. be worse than disorders wh. may be provoked by refusing it.

I.M.	Two ideas – barist African majority or variants on theme of parity.  Reluctantly I have come to prefer the second.  For the first is essentially a racial approach.  I am ready to give full support to 2nd course – wh. we evolved ourselves.

	Third roll.  Minimum no. of votes from each roll (12½%) : then devaluation of lower roll on basis of its excess numbers.  This is a challenge Wel. U.F.P. : if it really is a multi.racial Party he will get these seats : if he has no longer any African support, a liberal Party will win them.  Any Party which can capture these middle voted will gain the Govt.  Wish to present it in this way to Conference tomorrow.

H.	Greatest danger is secession by Wh. for that means a white African s. of the Zambizi &amp; an armed frontier.

	Only chance of establishing multi racial system, in politics or in society, is to enable Wel. to hold 2 or 3 Parlts. in Federation.
	We must demonstrate we intend to stay in Fedn. for some years – wd. like therefore to see big scheme for training Africans.

		Various questions raised for elucidiation.

I.M.	In reply to ques. on likely re-action of Africans.  Initially, hostile.
	But they are capable of being persuaded.  I may be able to moderate violence of their reaction. Best we can hope is that each side will say this doesn’t meet them but that they will accept it as a blue print by U.K. for the next phase.

R.A.B.	Real risk tht. Europeans in S. Rhodesia will take rash action to safeguard their position – whatever we do.  That being so, it is essential tht. we shd. base ourselves on principle;  And I would support this plan on tht.basis.

H.B.	I agree with that view.  

R.M. 	So do I – tho’ I’m nervous of the complexity of the plan – open to misrepresentation.

		Agreed.

	
3.	Capital Punishment.				[Enter Att.G,.

R.A.B.	Don’t believe there wd. be majority in this Parliament for extending c.p. or abolishing it.  Must therefore hold present position, despite the (conflicting) pressures.

	Propose also to resist amendmt. on C.J. Bill to raise age limit to 21 – because amount of serious crime by young people.
	Also shall resist demand for enquiry with Evans case.
	Finally, shall oppose motion tht. exercise of p. of m. shall be debatable in Parliament before the event.

J.M.	Support.
	Expectation of review after 5 years.

P.M.	Avoid commitment.  Discourage firm period of 5 years.

I.M.	Evans.  Court ruled tht. evidence v wife was admissible in charge v Child.  New evidence was admissible in charge v Child.  New evce. (sexually assaulted after death) suggests tht. Christie murdered Mrs. Evans.  I’m inclined to think Christie may have murdered the child.

Att.T.	Doubt if evce.established sexual connn. after death.  Also facial injuries – not typical of Christie’s murder.

R.A.B.	Tiero believes sexual intercourse was before death.
	Further enquiry wd. only make things worse.

K.	I agree.

		On general issue – support for R.A.B.’s line.

Att.G.	On C.J. Bill amendment, we may lose in Cttee.  We shall then have to consider wthr. we put it back on Report.
	

4.	Farm Price Review.				[Exit Att.G.

S.L.I.	Ready to settle for £10 m. more this year – positive determination of 
	£3 m.

R.M.	Awkward in negotns. with Europe.  May look like addl. protection for agriculture.

C.S.	Detailed presentn. will be less awkward than seems from global totals.

	Difficult : they have £19 m. addl. costs : will ask for £22-5 m.
	We shall be offering £3 m.

P.M.	We must say this involves no extension of the system.
