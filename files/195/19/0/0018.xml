		1.	U.N. Assembly.				[Enter M.R., L.

P.M.	Brief report on his visit to N.York.

D.S.	Commonwealth Mtg. on Disarmament – preceded by a mtg. of Officials : before the next Summit Mtg.

	
2.	National Health Service : Drugs for Private Patients.	[Enter E.P.
										[Exit L.
		………..

E.P.	Replying to S.Ll. – this is closely connected with prescribing.  It wd. help me to get co-opn. of B.M.A. in tightening up on prescribing.
	Double class of treatment – we have accepted that risk in allowing N.H. doctors to have private patients.  This only increases an existing risk.

	Repercussions : this is not a new story – completion of old one.  This is only outstanding instance in wh. patient is not free to choose.
	Can’t couple this with economy measures.  Cd. be coupled with the stamp – save for riposte that without it, increase in stamp cd. be less.

Ch.H.	This wd. certainly improve relns. with B.M.A.  But 2 criticisms – 
	i) Under Pilkington no deductn. for private practice.  Thus, this will give increase remuneration to some doctors.
	ii) Doctor in N.H.S. will find it easier to persuade people to become private patient.  This is likely to happen.

	Despite this, I wd. favour it on balance.  But on timing, it will seem odd to add £2½ m. for richer classes when we are gaining contributions of all, incldg. poorer.

	Cd. it be linked with doctors’ promise of lighter prescribing.

D.E.	i)  B.M.A. of course favour this.  What do leaders of profession think?
	ii) What of dentists?  We are short of them and don’t want more drawn into private practice.

E.P.	On ii) no effect – for v. little prescribing by dentists.

I.M.	On balance I favour this.  But don’t like linking it with increase in stamp.  Labour Party cd. easily put us in diffy. over that.

S.Ll.	I wd. be easier about this if it cd. be put in a suitable context – eg. reform of prescribing.

J.M.	On merits, this has a low priority.  But, on our pledge, we must soon do it or say we aren’t going to do it.

H.B.	I agree with J.M.’s view.  But think it v. diff. to do it with an increase in stamp.

R.M.	Pledge is 11 years old.  Can’t justify doing it now.

E.P.	Will get harder to do it – for I shall want to introduce economy measures.  Better to get it out of the way.

R.A.B.	V. awkward situation in H/C.  Important to get this out of way.

P.M.	Must defer decision until we have S.Ll.’s proposals on the stamp.  M’while say nothing at Scarboro’.  Tho’ Cab. seem to agree tht. this will have to be done, soon.  Cab. shd. discuss stamp proposal in week after Scarboro’.  If we agree with that, we shd. consider whr. we do this at same time – recognising that, if we don’t, we can’t do it for some time.

H.B.	Less public fuss if it were announced at Scarboro’.

P.T. &amp; E.M.	I agree.

P.M.	But we haven’t agreed to S.Ll.’s proposal on stamp.  Unless he gets this, we shdn’t be forced to accept the other – in advance.
	Must p’pone decision on this.		Agreed.
								[Exit E.P.

	
3.	Industrial Disputes.  Railways.

J.H.	Rlway shopmen.  Long negotns.  B.R. made offer, over 5% already given – of 3% for unskilled 4% for skilled 3½% for semi-skilled.  Union content with 1st and 3rd but not on 2nd.  N.U.R. announced at once they wd. strike.  Engineers decided to go back to B.R. and urged N.U.R. to do so.  Latter agreed.  Will see B.R. tomorrow.
	B.R. wants to suggest arbitn. – they won’t go to the Ct. – he will suggest some ad hoc tribunal.

	What if this offer of arbitn. is refused?

	a) M/L. enquiry  b) M/L. conciliation c) Stand aside.
	Mtg. of Ministers favoured a).  My advisers are against that – it wd. bind no one.  My feeling is in favour of doing b), fairly soon.  We shall have to come in.  (1/6d. p. wk. for 40.000 is all that is at issue.)  I favour doing this at once, if they refuse to go to arbitration.

M.	Wait and see what they say to B.R.

E.M.	Skills notices are for 17/10.  We shdn’t delay.  Ministers cd. meet &amp; decide, w’in Cab. authy. on Saty. am.

J.H.	Better to tell B.R. to suggest M/L. conciln. at once, if they refuse arbitn.

E.M.	No.  Let it be establd. first tht. they have refused arbitn.

I.M.	Agree : but M/L. shd. move before week-end.

P.M.	M/L. and M/T. to review posn. on Friday pm.
	Offer of good offices of M/L. to be made before strike occurs.

			Report to P.M. with recommendations.  Friday pm.

	
4.	Iceland.

C.S.	Looks as tho’ talks are going to break down.  Warn Cab. tht. we may have to consider posn. early next week.  Truce ends 12/x.
