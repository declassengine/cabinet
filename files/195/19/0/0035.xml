		1.	Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.

P.M.	Despite strength of views, had thght. on Wed. pm. it might be possible to reach agreement on basis of draft communiqué.  Think we cd. have forced this thro’ with pressure – on basis of respect for U.K.
	But doubt if it wd. have had any lasting value.  Clear tht. some Afro. Asians wd. have campaigned for S.A.’s excln. from then on : - some might even have considered w’drawing themselves.

	Dr. V. unwilling to make any concession even on dipl. repn. of African members of C’wealth.

	We wd. have gained shadow, not reality.  Posn. at a future mtg. wd. have bn. v. difficult.

	Sorrow for people in S.A. of Br. origin.
	Dr.V.’s manner of w’drawal was v. dignified.
	May increase pol. diffies. at home – also diffies. over Central Africa.

R.A.B.	Persuaded tht. P.M. cd. not have done more.  Menzies of that opinion.
	Heavy responsibility for P.M.

	There will be some trouble with Party.  Analogy with U.N. (Dr. V.) won’t help us much.

D.S.	i)	Impressive courtesy &amp; restraint.
	ii)	We cd. have got agreement on basis we proposed : but public 	discord over it wd. have followed,  Determination of several 	Afro. Asians to pursue the issue in public outside the mtg.

H.	Agub said tht. Pak. cd. not stay in C’wealth for long if S.A. remained.
	But diffies. in Africa.  Portugal may leave U.N. &amp; stand with S.A.
	Concentration of world opinion on our problems in C. Africa.

I.M.	Tanganyika wd. not have joined : nor W. Indies : Nigeria wd. have left.

	Concerned however at action v. Govt. not people by this assocn. of peoples.

D.E.	Keep door open for return of S.A. under another Govt.

C.S.	Pressure on H.C. territories.


		2.	Parliament.
