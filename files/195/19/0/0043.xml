  <content>C.C.22(61)							20th April 1961


		1.	Cuba.

E.H.	Informn. from W’ton is that attempt has failed.  Consequences in S. America may be v. serious.

	Debate in U.N. today.  We will vote for resoln. referring to O.A.S.
	Mexican resoln. is awkward : we shall abstain, on basis tht. we are voting for the other.

R.A.B.	H/C. may try to debate on adjournment.  They can bite on U.N. aspect.  Awkward in respect of relns. with U.S.

P.M.	Must support U.S. when they are in trouble.

I.M.	They won’t get the adjournment.

	
2.	Laos.

E.H.	Gromyko has given explicit assurances in addn. to note.  U.S. ready to accept.

	May get appeal for cease fire tonight.

	
3.	Parliament.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.

	Wedgwood Benn.

R.A.B.		B. adopted for Bristol.  Tory candidate standing against : will lose : but 		cd. take the seat if Benn disqualified.  Ld. Lambton will speak for 			Benn : most of our other dissidents are under control.

	Govt. spokesmen shd. appear in election campaign.  Election Count.
	Next crisis will be when B. tries to take his seat.

Att.G.	Have memo. from Clerk to H/C.  Don’t agree with it, and will answer it.

R.A.B.	Thought tht. speaker will exclude B., but allow Gaitskell to raise the ques.  He may propose Sel. Cttee.

Att.G.	If we want to stand firm, we have few arguments.  Shd. we appoint Dpl. Cttee. on all matters affectg. membership (not powers) of H/L. – composed of independents.  To consider effect on H/L. itself of any change in system – eg. how many Peers wd. slide out of Parly. obligns.
	Otherwise we shall be in trouble as soon as election is over.
	Cttee. : Ld. of Appeal : non political Peers : constitutional experts.
        x/.	T. of r. going wider than renunciation – shd. cover Irish &amp; Scottish Peers &amp; Peeresses (hereditary) – to get it away from B.

Hail.	Can’t stand pat.  I wanted joint Sel. Cttee. of both Houses : but that is rejected.  Agree with x/. but no wider.  Younger Peers shd. be represented on Cttee.  Wish to consult Govt. Whip on form of enquiry.

Att.G.	Joint Sel. Cttee. wd. bend to be weighted in favour of change.

Hail.	Not sure H/L. wd. tolerate independent body on which they as a House are not represented.

P.M.	Consider wthr. Govt. motion shd. be tabled ahead of Gaitskill’s .  Or make an announcement of enquiry.

Ch.H.	Announcement – and in advance of election campaign.

P.M.	Will Parlt. tolerate an independent enquiry?  Believe you will need to have Joint Select Cttee.  In that event let us table a resolution at once.

K.	We must recognise, if we do this, tht. there will be some change – in direction of a right of renunciation.

R.A.B.	We recognise need for consideration – no more at this stage.

		R.A.B., K., Att.G. – to confer.
							[Exit Att.G.


		4.	Europe – Washington Talks.

P.M.	Cab. shd. consider long range problems of Europe etc.
	Fundamental Ques : Is existing organn. of free world apt for the period ahead – given Six &amp; its potential direction.  Do we need to try to re-construct it.  At this moment, it comes down to ques : shall we go into Six, with derogations, &amp; accompand. by some of Seven – again econ. advantage in future for U.K. and C’wealth.  &amp; create pol. structure in Europe which will balance de G. now and Germany later.  Are we to try for this?  If so, what tactical approach do we make?  The present technical gavotte will get us nowhere.

	Do we want this?  Are we ready to pay price?  How do we do it?
	Before next Election we must have resolved this – one way or other.

K.	Most urgent problems –
	a)	General picture of French w’drawal from co-operation with West. 			because of antipathy to “Anglo Saxons”.  An important initial 			difficulty.  Will this lead to third Force, with risk of neutralism.  Or 
	can it be turned by Tripartitism.  The second course leads to –

	Nuclear problem.  What of the other potential nuclear Powers.  What effect will that have on internatl. affairs.
	Which do French want.

	b)	Berlin.  Disturbed by Acheson’s idea of a land prob. at divisional 
	strength.  Is this a serious suggn?  Is it brinkmanship?

	Welcome further informn. on a) and b).

	c)	The Six.  P.M.’s ideas as put fwd. in W’ton.  Time factor.
	When must we define our posn.?  What derogations shd. we seek?  Are we ready for co-opn. with Europe on basis of Treaty of Rome.  The pol. institns. encroach on Parlt.’s posn. : must be ready on that.  i) Restriction on omni competence of Parlt., wh. wd. have to accept decns. of Council.  Also v. difft. to w’draw : one Parlt. wd. be binding another.
	ii) Restriction of right of Executive to make Treaties.  iii) Appeal from H/L. to supreme court of Six.  This wd. need large campaign to win public acceptance.

	Economic points.  Effect on C’wealth partners.  Other members of Seven.  U.K. agriculture.  Cost of food.
	World econ. posn.  Extended credit base : imbalance etc.
	Here again world central bank wd. involve encroachment on sovereignty (Dillon).

P.M.	Econ. diffies. – C’wealth and U.K. agriculture.

D.S.	Some C’wealth countries wd. suffer.  Canada (because of export of manufacturers).  N.Z. wd. be in diffies.  Tropical foods cd. prob. be handled.

	Approach – decide first wthr. this is right : then we can see what cd. be done to mitigate diffies. &amp; how to persuade other C’wealth countries to acquiesce.

	My view : we must go in – and pretty deeply, if we are not to have worst of both worlds.  Press negotns.  to point at which we can see what price we have to pay.  Believe we cd. then persuade C’wealth to acquiesce. 

R.M.	In 1954 we under estimated strength of E. movemt. to unity.
	Damage to U.K.  Exclusion fr. most dynamic market in world.  2 (missed) 3 U.S. interest &amp; investment will shift to Europe.  We must therefore try to get in.

E. Free Trade Area failed because France didn’t want it.  Believe they still don’t want us because they want to lead Europe.  They will remain reluctant.  We shall have to fashion a line which make it imposs. for Fr. to resist.

	Diffy. for us, not tariffs, but single commercial policy.  This unless modified wd. wreck our relns. with C’wealth.

	Agriculture : no problem for farmers – for consumers, yes.
	Horticulture must suffer.  These we wd. have to pay price.
	Agric. policy of Six hasn’t bn. settled.  We might be able to influence it.

	Br. industry is aware, increasingly, of advantages.
	Pol. fedn. is not necessary consequence of T. of Rome.  Need be no barrier there.

D.S.	Don’t under-rate influence we shd. have, if we were in, in changing their policy.

R.M.	Seven.  They are worried.  Econ. problems of bringing them in are not too difficult.  Same econ. system for all, but differing pol. obligns.  They are suspicious.

C.S.	H’to we have wanted to exclude agric. because of our diff. system of support.  We shd. consider, not immediate results if we do, but long term effects if we don’t go in.  Grave risks to own system if we aren’t in.  Surpluses in West are growing.  Traditional supplies are increasg. prodn.  Six = net importers now.  They aren’t planning produce surpluses – but to be more autarchic.
	Improved structure of agric. (50% of Fr. farmers under 12½ acres.) will however lead to increased prodn.  They will fix prices inter sc : &amp; prices will have to be higher than most efficient and that will increase their prodn.  In the end therefore they may be self-sufficient or surplus.  We, with open market, will receive simpler prodn. fr. there and elsewhere.

	Br. agric. can’t be static : will improve : world prices will fall &amp; greater imports available.  Cost to Exch. of m’taining Br. agric. might then (5-10 yrs) be nearly double what it is now.

	Think therefore in terms of moving to continental system/support.
	That wd. accord with joining. Six.  But, if we do, we must do it in good time.  So far, they have no more than strategic concept – no decns. on detail.  Pressure in Fr, for decns..  Fr. thght nearer to ours (lower prices) than Germans.  Must get in before these decns. taken.

	Effect on our farmers.  Not as easy as R.M. suggests.  Aspects (pigs, eggs, hortic.) will be damaged.  And we shall have to make them realise how things wd. go if we didn’t go in to Six.

	Most will fear unknown.  Also in Manifesto we said we wdn’t change our system in this Parlt.

	As M/Food, are studying effect off Eur. system on cost of food &amp; b/p.  Study complete in May.
	C’wealth.  Fr. know there are things we can’t do – eg. butter from N.Z. &amp; wheat fr. Austr. &amp; Canada – they won’t ask us to do these if they want us in.  We cd. work out arrangements for temperate f’stuffs at least for next 7 years or so.

	Net income of B. agric. will be lower.  C’wealth trade will be lower.
	Six will insist on our increasing food imports fr. Europe.
	We shd. take care tht. plans hit 3rd countries harder than Br. agric. &amp; C’wealth trade.

	French won’t invite us.  We shall have to press.

P.M.	Of £250 m. about £160 m. is in support of prices?

C.S.	Yes : in future you wd. set U.K. prices and fix tariffs so that imports sell at same price.  Effect : transfer cost fr. Exch. to consumer.

D.E.	Farmer now gets paid from market prices and Ty.  Under new system he wd. rely only on market.  This, to stay high, requires control of quantity – on imports by tariff and volume.  This ends free entry.  Is that right?  C.S.  No.  Control price of imported food : no need then to control quantity.

C.S.	Pigs necessarily will be diff. because Danes do them so much better.
	But we shall have time to bring our price down.

J.H.	We are more efficient farmers than any in Six &amp; wd. be able to export into Six.

P.T.	On balance we cd. afford to pay a high price to get into this market.
	Adv. of incln. in a big econ. unit.  cf. R. and U.S. output p. worker which surpasses ours remarkably.  We cd. carry on alone for a time but at increasing disadvantage.

	Disadvantages of staying out.  Six &amp; U.S. will forge ahead.  We shall be increasingly pinched out of 3rd markets.

	New look in U.S. – for talks.  U.S. can divide Europe.  Gt. new thought tht. they want us in.  A new opportunity.

	U.S. still under-estimate problem of France : their determination to rise above this existg. level of power.  Examine scope of our talks with France.

	Endorse D.S. in C’wealth.  Have a policy before we talk.
	Favour going forward – on balance.

D.E.	Tremendous issue to put to Br. people.
	Adv. to our economy – large market – won’t weigh with public feeling v surrender of independence, damage to C’wealth etc.,
	S.A. decn. was gt. relief to public because of sentiment re C’wealth as something above economics.  European venture which damaged C’wealth wdn’t do.  Only basis for presentn. therefore is need to knit free world together to balance rate of growth in Sino-Soviet bloc.

	Canada will be injured.  Offer them free trade area status now.
	U.S. look fwd. thro’ O.E.C.D. to assimilation of trading areas on both sides of Atlantic.

	Tropical f’stuffs won’t be easy.  Ball’s views.  S. American produces of coffee etc.,  Unless they modify that attitude, Colonies will suffer.

R.A.B.	Want to reserve my posn. on political aspects.

		Agreed : resume Wed. 26/4.

P.M.	Berlin.  Welcome change of attitude v passes etc. – practical interruptn. of supplier is real test for a physical response.  That surely is a great &amp; useful change.  With it goes the line that, if this does happen, it means war : a real test of will.

	Thus, if there is a show down, it is to be on a reality.
