  <content>CC.C.40(60)							7th July 1960.
	

		1.	Parliament.					[Enter M.R.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.

		
2.	International Monetary Fund.

H.A.	We can move to Art.8. – in the sense that our economic posn. warrants it.  De facto we now have all the restrictions applicable under Art.8.
	At same time, we don’t want to move faster than others : and should do what we can to p’pone move by others rather than hasten it.

	Draw attention to para.8 of memo.  But drawing rights also depend on Fund being satisfied v internal economy.

	France is not in a hurry to move : they may hold back the other members of the Six.

	Para.9. of memo.  No discrimination save v. currencies declared ‘scarce’.  This wd. mean tht. we cdn’t discriminate v. all non sterling area countries generally.  Unlikely tht. in future all countries of st. area wd. be willing again to discriminate v. dollars.  Also Canadian position.  Experience has shown tht. internatl. rules can’t prevent country from acting to protect its economic interests : no v. real risk therefore.

R.M.	If we get into trouble, it wd. not be dollars only – non sterling countries – because so great a measure of general convertibility.

	No advantage in rushing this.  Danger to £ if we held back when others went forward.

D.E.	We have raised Bank Rate etc. partly because of b/payment position : odd to move soon after to Art.8.

H.A.	Unlikely we shall have to move before end/autumn.

D.E.	Even so, mistake to do it unless confident that our economy can stand open competition in world trade.  Have we that confidence now?
	We shd. have no control over anything but transfers of capital.

P.M.	Travel allowances – no proof of lack of confidence if we thought it wise to cut these back.

H.A.	We cd. on a non discriminatory basis.

R.A.B.	That is only difference.  Under either Article we shd. have to justify our action to the Fund.

I.M.	We shd. act on behalf of U.K. and Colonies.  We shd. have to make it clear to Fund tht. Colonies on becoming independent cd. apply for membership of Fund on basis of Art.14. not 8.

P.M.	Take note of memo and points in discussion.
	Await developments.
	Be prepared to decide when others move.
