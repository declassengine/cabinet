R.A.B.	Business for next week.
	Stansgate.  Procedure for debating ques. wthr. Speaker is right in ruling i) that he can’t take his seat in H/C. ii) tht. he cannot be heard.  Hope to telescope into one debate, on Govt. motions but there may have to be two.  Will last most of the day.

2.	George Blake.

P.M.	P.N. Ques. disallowed because 3 Ques. on paper for next week. But mistake for me to rely on that.  Wiser to volunteer statement.
	Must stand to point tht. I cannot say to Parlt. what L.C.J. agreed shd. not be said in public court.

	This was not normal security risk : no bad habits or associations : accepted no money : genuine conversion to Comm. cause.  V. hard to detect.

	Cdn’t have rule v. emplt of anyone who was in Communist hands cf. Bishop of B’ham.

	Can’t admit nature of his work : can say negatively some of the things he did not do.

	Conference.  Prince S. has said he won’t attend.  Fr. suggested p’ponement.  We think it shd. start on 12/5, as arranged.

	U.S. Govt. attitude – concentrate on cease fire : if it breaks down, inclined to favour U.N. debate – to send observers into Laos etc.
	R. &amp; U.K. mght sponsor such a resolution.   

	
4.	Europe.

E.H.	Official talks with French went better than we expected.  More responsive on EFTA and on agriculture.  Will circulate report.

R.A.B.	Parly. posn. not so easy.  Deputn. fr. agric. lobby urging pledge of no change in this Parlt.
