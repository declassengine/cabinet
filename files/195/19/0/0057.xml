  <content>C.C.40(61)							13th July 1961


		1.	Parliament.					[Enter M.R.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.
	Tuesday : Labour propose to debate economic sitn. on Supply.  Premature.

	R.M. and S.L.I. to settle Govt. spokesmen.  Possibly R.M. and junior Ty. Minister.

	Before Parlt. rises H/C. will expect debates on Kuwait, F. affairs and C. Market.


		2.	Kuwait.

H.W.	Plans for thinning out. Bulwark + 42 commandos to Singapore.  Army units to Bahrain.

H.	Best move until we can devise another long term means of guaranteeing independence of Kuwait.

	
3.	Foreign Affairs.

H.	a)	Russia.  Will circulate analysis of K.’s recent speeches.
	b)	Congo.  Kasabubu &amp; Tohonita are again showing signs of non co-
		operation and may fall out.
H.W.	c)	Berlin.  Studying means of bringing B.A.O.R. up to strength.
		Mght need a proclamation.

	
4.	Post Office Tariffs.				[Enter P.M.G.

P.M.G.	Increased pay &amp; shorter hours - £26 m. p.a.  Surplus will fall
	from £22 m. to £6 m. this year &amp; next year to nil – unless charges increased.  My change will result in surplus of £16 m. this year and £27 m. next.  Increase mainly on traffics which are losing money.

	Increased telephone rental will be unpopular.  But investment in tel. services must be m’tained.  Check to increased installns. wd. be useful to avoid larger waiting list.

	Timing.  Wd. prefer to have mine the day before S.L.I’s statement.

S.L.I	Support substance of plan.

M.	Shd. we be raising prices when S.L.I. will call for stability.

S.L.I.	Content on that – matches what I shall say on natd. industries.

Ch.H.	If separate statement, increase emphasis on wages rather than self financing argument.  

E.M. 	Agree : relate it to wages.

H.B.	Increased investment on phones won’t seem consistent with cuts in social service investment.

D.E.	Too close a link with wages may imply tht., in monopoly, workers can always get more for prices can be increased proportionately.
	Example of weakness.

S.L.I.	Timing.  Wd. prefer it on following, or same day.

R.M.	Delay to autumn – wd. be better out of S.L.I.’s way.

	General view : this is right, but wiser to defer until October.
	That wd. mean under 5% earnings this year – but 8% next.

D.E.	Link it with standstill on P.O. workers’ wages.

Ch.H.	Then do it at time of S.L.I.’s statement – if consistent.

		Agreed :	1)	P.M.G. and S.L.I. to re-consider timing : 				can’t have this on same day as S.L.I. 					unless incorporated in his.
				2)	Consider graduated charge via flat on 				parcels.  (as in brief).

I.M.	Let S.L.I. consider wthr. this is consistent with his line or not.

R.A.B.	If desired to do it before recess, P.M. (or Cab.) shd. be informed.
							[Exit P.M.G.
	
5.	Trade Union Elections.		[Enter Att.G., Ld. Adv.

J.H.	Can’t rest on this judgement alone.
	T.U.C. cd. deal with this (model rules) and shd. be given chance to do so.

	Tho’ necessary to provide for elections to be run by independent body.
	Doubt, however, wthr. T.U.C. will do this on their own.  We shd. therefore indicate tht., in default, we will legislate.  Such legn. wd. strengthen posn. of rank &amp; file – power to Registrar to hear complaints, to investigate &amp; to impose remedies – for any breach of election rules.

	On timing, I wd. consult Cab. later.  Oppn. have expressed hope we shan’t do anything appearing to be attack on T.U.’s.  Labour M.P.’s likely to take better line than T.U.C. on this.  They might support Govt. legn. if we had given T.U.C. time to act themselves.

Att.G.	a)  E.T.U. case showed rules were unintelligible – to a point at which almost impossible to say wthr. they have bn. complied with.
	Believe it wd. be possible to empower Registrar to declare that rules are not workable.  Consistent with I.L.O. convention.  Hope this can be considered – via model rules.
	b) Conduct of elections.  Not much to give Registrar same powers as courts now have.  Procdgs. before Registrar wd. be little less costly &amp; lengthy – and ? no legal aid.  Suggest Registrar be empowered to organise conduct of election at expense of the T.U.

	T.U.’s which didn’t avail themselves of this service wd. be open to public criticism.  Consider this, with Unions.

J.H.	In logic I don’t quarrel with either of these proposals.
	But a) wd. be represented as incursion into T.U.’s right to make own rules. and b) wd. be unpopular, too.

	Ready to discuss both with T.U.’s., but not to press either – for it will open us to criticism of undue pressure on T.U.’s.
	Even action on my limited plan wd. be quite a formidable new stop.

R.A.B.	But it gives no effective right to put things right.

Hail.	Agree.  Why not empower Registrar to declare invalid rules which don’t comply with I.L.O. Convention on elections “in full freedom”.

I.M.	As soon as you empower Registrar to alter rules, there will be great row with Unions.

          x/.	Prs. announce we intend to appoint Judge to consider wthr a) and b) shd. be covered.

J.H.	On my tactics, we only say we shall do something : we needn’t say yet exactly what we wd. propose to do.

H.?	Danger is tht. T.U.C. offls. will promise to act, but produce no results.

J.H.	Wd. pin them down to promise 2 things – model rules &amp; independent running of elections.

K.	Para.5 wd. be an advance.
	Not sure tht. power to declare rules unintelligible is consistent with right of T.U. under convention to make its own rules.  Possibly this can be w’in concept of a voluntary service.

Att.G.	Will let J.H. have my suggns. in writing * R.A.B. Circulate to Cabinet.

R.A.B.	Keep x/. in mind as intervening stage.

J.H.	At this stage we need not commit ourselves in any detail to what our “action” wd. be.

J.H.	Timing.  Tell T.U.C. at once we wd. like to see them put house in order.  Public anxiety etc.  If they can’t we wd. be prepd. to frame legn. to protect individual members.

	Wd. like to say somethg. on same lines in H/L. – statement after Ques. next week.

I.M.	Statement w’out promise of legn. wd. be unpopular with our side.

J.H.	Want to threaten legn. in order to prevent E.T.U. election in autumn being rigged – thro’ local officials.

D.E.	P.M. P.Q. saying J.H. is talking in T.U.’s.

S.L.I.	Or J.H. answer written P.Q. – subject to P.M.’s approval.  *

K.	T.U.C. might ask tht. they shd. be given power to approve rules?
	That wd. suit us – greater responsibility of T.U.C.

	
6.	Germany : Assets in U.K.		[Exit Att.G. &amp; L. Adv.

P.M.		As in memo.

H.		Support.

			Approved.

	
7.	Wages and Prices.  C.O.P.P.I.

S.L.I.	Council wish to disband after next (4th) report.  Have Cabinet any view to contrary?  In f’coming debate, I mght suggest need to improve consusltn. with both sides of industry : it wd. be consistent with that to say this will be disbanded.

		Agreed :  S.L.I. to submit minute to P.M. on these lines.
