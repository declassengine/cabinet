		4.	Federation of Rhodesia etc.			[M.R.
									[Enter Alport

I.M.	Not heard.

P.M.	Ultimate problem – for how long is constitutional phase to last?  Appetite for fixed dates.  Diffies. i) a Govt. here has no power to bind successor ii) Encourages Africans not to make the current model work.  An aspect of gt. problem – how fast do we go : eg. Algeria, the moment was missed.  We are caught between the 2 fires of Boston Tea Party or a servile war : &amp; we have not strength to resist either by force.  Yet gt. domestic pol. diffies. here in U.K.  To Welensky no loyalty among N. or S. Rhodesian Europeans.
	Insufficient support for Fedn.

C.J.A.	Greenfield is satisfied with arrangemts. made to enable him to express his views.  Being here, he is better able to understand strength of feeling on other side.


		5.	Newspaper Mergers.

R.A.B.	Diffies. of enquiry.  Play for time.  M’while look at posn. under Monopolies Commn.  Action on that wd. be helpful.
	Also television aspects might be considered by Pilkington.
	What of offering talks with Opposn.?  Allows time to heal.

P.M.	Enquiry into financial negotns. cd. not be limited to newspp.

R.M.	Don’t want wide enquiry into morals of take-over bids.  Jenkins Cttee. on Company law will consider techniques.

S.Ll.	Structure of newspaper industry – good if it cd. be examined.

Att.G.	S.3 of Mon. Act wd. cover magazines.  More doubtful about public interest – s.14 defines it too narrowly for this situation.

P.M.	Increase in cost or redn. in choice wd. be a matter of public interest?

Att.G.	Not sure – it might break down.

R.M.	It wd. certainly look at ques. from economic angle.  Ques. of choice is hardly economic.

P.M.G.	The T.V. point cd. be referred to Pilkington.

P.M.	Ought Govt. to do what Times’ suggest industry shd. do.

S.Ll.	What kind of enquiry – not Sel. Cttee., nor R. Commn.  Why not a small Cttee. of three wise men, into structure of industry.

R.A.B.	Don’t offer that today.  Talk to Oppn.

P.M.	They wd. widen it up into general ques. of organisation of industry.

J.H.	Real problem : power of T.U.’s price of newsprint, advertising rates.
	Favour S.Ll.’s idea of enquiry into that.

Ch.H.	Modern trend to bigness – does it present special problem in reln. to newspapers.  Sooner or later we shall have to do so.

K.	Opposed to enquiry into Press.  Nonsense to speak of monopoly. of dailies in Ldn.  In every big provincial city a local daily too.

	Nothing near a monopoly.  Ample choice.
	Magazines are different – referable to Commn., if you wish.
	Economic posn. of Press – governed by newsprint.  T.U. practices etc.
	There are matters for the industry.

	If Govt. assume responsibility and order enquiry, we shall excite hostility of Press and raise whole issue of capitalist structure.
	Keep Govt. action limited to magazines &amp; the T.V. point.
	Don’t placate opponents by attacking friends.

H.W.	Proprietors of newspapers unwilling to stand up to T.U.’s.  Enquiry wd. reveal some damaging informn. on this.

S.Ll.	Provincial Press, I believe, wd. wish to be helped over T.U. restrictive practices.

K.	But how distinguish this fr. attack on Press?

E.H.	By limiting enquiry to economies.

I.M.	Arguments are v. all sorts of enquiry.  Don’t let Monop Commn. into this.  Magazines : there are too many &amp; merger will squeeze somethg. out.  Enquiry won’t help on v. practices – for employers won’t be firm over them, whatever an enquiry says.

	No inquiry save on T.V. point.

C.S.	No case for enquiry now on magazines.

Ch.H.	Might be if King controlled 90%.

P.M.	Is this a storm which will blow over? If so, general statement with minimum commitment.

	Or do we think Govt. action is required?

E.H.	Bigger issue – freedom of Press.  Fear tht. national newspp. will become fewer &amp; under fewer hands.  Disappearance of left wing papers turns others anti. Tory.

	Best way of tackling it : economic.  But report might put us in posn. of having to act – both on v. practices and on anti-trust.
