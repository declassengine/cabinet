  <content>C.C.20(61)							13th April 1961

	
1.	Parliament.					[Enter M.R.

R.A.B.	Business for following week.

	
2.	Laos.

H.	Told Gromyko we are ready for appeal for cease fire : I.C.C. to go to Delhi : conference on 2/5.  Date is getting v. close.  R. have not given affirmative reply.  U.S. are pressing for it.  R. say they may be able to answer by end/week.

	Military posn. a little better.  Royal troops stiffened by U.S. volunteers and gun crews from Thailand.

	Attitude of new Admn.

	Souvanna Phonma is going to W’ton.  If U.S. can be satisfied by this tht. he is not Communist, then difft. corner wd. have bn. rounded.
	No danger of Br. troops being committed w’out Cab. Authy.

	
3.	Nuclear Tests Conference.

H.	We have accepted several R. points : but now we are confronted with 3 Chairman plan.  We and U.S. must resist this.  Proposed now tht. we shd. table full Treaty proposals to bring out how far (length of moratorium : no. of control posts : minor points too) ques. are outstanding.

	
4.	Kuwait.						[Enter J.P.

E.H.	Ruler indicated in January tht. 1899 Agreement must be terminated but he wants to retain our friendship.  Problem : how to do this w’out rousing U.A.R.  We don’t know how Ruler wd. wish to proceed.  Three alternatives have therefore bn. worked out.
	Pol. President wd. like to discuss a) and b) with Ruler – who might think if a) put fwd. alone tht. we were backing out of obligns..  If he were shown b), it wd. be easier to make him realise tht. only point of a) wd. be to avoid upsetting U.A.R.

K.	Under a) cd. we not affirm that 1914 agreement still stands.

S.L.I.	I’m sure Treaty wd. be mistake.

J.P.	Still commits us to give mil. aid in emergency : this means tht. we must m’tain our base in Aden – w’out which we cdn’t meet that oblign.

I.M.	Our constitutional plans for Aden are based on view tht. strategic considns. are paramount and tht. we shd. retain our posn. (base) there for as long as possible.

P.M.	We ought to preserve our right, as well as duty, to go to assistce. of Kuwait.
								[Exit J.P.
	
5.	Education. Teachers’ Salaries in Scotland.

J.M.	Burnham Cttee. have recommended increase equivalent to 18%.
	This is an agreed recommn., in spite of intimation from me tht. Govt. wd. not be able to look at anything of this order.

S.L.I.	Hope that in these circs. S. of  S. will reject it.

D.E.	We are lagging behind.  Our l.a.’s offer won’t be more than 10 or 11% to start with – tho’ they wd. go higher in negotiation.
	But if concession made by S. Of S. in face of strike threat, that wd. become minimum for English negotiation.

	On comparability and qua recruitment (for some modern subjects) there is doubtless a strong case for large increase.

J.M.	Violent Sc. reaction was provoked by Police award.  They feel they have got far behind.
	T.U. leaders have lost control.  Can’t avoid a strike.

S.L.I.	14% means £50 m.  Agree that 10 or 11% wd. be reasonable opening offer.  Hope we might settle (England) for 12% or a little more.

D.E.	Must not give in to strikes by people who aspire to professional status.

S.L.I.	Favour plain rejection coupled with offer to talk.
	Next ques. will be : shd. he make some counter offer before strikes?

D.E.	Support tht. J.M. rejects this now &amp; we consider next week in wages, policy Cttee our detailed plan esp. for differential rates for science and maths. graduates.

J.H.	Cd. we not also try to put timing of Sc./E. &amp; Wales synchronised?

		Memo. approved.

	
6.	Railway Working Week.

M.	They are asking for redn. of 4 hrs.  B.T.C. think redn. of 2 hours is justifiable, in view of condns. elsewhere ….

		Memo. approved.


		7.	Disputes : Trawlermen.

C.S.	Grimsby is still out.  Other ports are back.
	Object : get Paris agreement amended.  Owners are firm on this but ready to discuss wages and condns. if strike stops.

	
8.	P.M.’s Visit to Washington : Ottawa.

P.M.	Talks in W’ton valuable and encouraging.
	Visit to Key West was useful as enabling first contact to be on a specific issue.

	Laos : this Admn. accepts our view tht. political settlement and neutral pad are resist aims.  But his dilemma – appeasement or war mongering (Korea).  I have tried to ensure tht. Eis. won’t come out against Adminn.  Unless R. delay reply too long, we ought to get over this.  Mil. authies. &amp; local dipl. repves. are dangerously independent – tho’ President is against that : will overcome it eventually.

	General discussions.  Record will be circulated.
	Mr. K is a remarkable man.  Quiet : listens : uses experts : reserves own decisions.  Has built up his public position.  Brought in many of the old figures – studying &amp; travelling : at the centre a hive of egg heads from Harvard.  So far, no result, save continuance of recession and unemplt.  Soon, he will have to disclose an economic policy – or misery of unemployed will be dangerous : esp. as the first to lose jobs are always negroes and recent immigrants.  He wants to be expansionist : but hampered by industry’s anxieties v competn. and also by large backing for currency.

	They are more anxious to work with us than Rep. Govt. were : and easier to get on with them.  Mr.K. (&amp; the others) are so much more open minded.  Think he will want to do big things but he is not in a hurry.

	Good relations established : he has asked me to continue to let him have my thoughts.

	When decisions come, they will be his.  Not staff study method of Eisenhower.  None of his executive assistants has any pol. authority or standing.

	Believe we shall get U.S. support for what we decide to do on economic &amp; financial policy, Europe and even defence.  We must let him lead &amp; play second fiddle.  He has only small majority in Congress.

	Tough, ambitious but broad minded.
	When record circulated, we cd. have Cabinet Discussion – perhaps next week.
C.S.	Six?  

P.M.	They want us in, for pol. reasons – which in their view outweights the economic inconvenience to them.

R.A.B.	Press reports (incldg. M.I.T. speech) have caused restlessness in H/C. who think we are ahead of them.

P.M.	Can overcome particular diffies. if we have a general theme which is seen to make the diffies. Worth while.

H.	U.S. diffies. over China in U.N.

P.T.	Attitude to French on military ques?

P.M.	They see tht. France is the key : less cross about them, more ready to see tht. they are a problem.
