C.C.46(60)							26th July 1960


		1.	Oversea Civil Service.			[Enter M.R.

P.M.	Mtg. at which H.A. was represented (in his absence in Paris) by E. Boyle with object of meeting main objective at lower cost.  New proposal – cost at £14 m. vice £24.28 – tho’ only real change is continued payment of half passages by Col. Govts. at saving of only £3.5!  This is supported by H. and I.M.

H.A.	Challenge figures.  Gross total of £24.28 was offset by £3¼ m. saving – giving £21 m.  Saving on new passage proposal brings it to £18.5.
	The balance of £4 m. represents dedn. of pensions etc., (which will come in later).  And oversea expenditure wd. be £13.5 m. of the net £21 m.

P.M.	Inducement pay £9 m. – some wd. be spent here.  Education allowances almost all in U.K.  Pensions &amp; passages almost all at home.

H.A.	Don’t argue that this will affect f. exchange i.e. reserves – but it will effect U.K. b/payments.

I.M.	Savings as cpd. with earlier scheme : giving total cost of £14 m. or a little under.  Strain on overseas expenditure must be v. small.

H.A.	Agree figure is £14 m. at once, rising to £16 m. – and then dropping.
	B/p. figure is £13.5., however.

	My 2 objns.  i) we can’t allow any increase in Estimates w’out off-setting economies.  ii) effect on b/payments.

	I cd. not therefore recommend it.

R.A.B.	This is basic to our oversea administration.  If economies must be sought, we must find them elsewhere.

H.A.	Why do we have to relieve Col. Govts. – enough to carry extra costs?

P.M.	This is a v. high priority.  But I accept oblign. to look for savings elsewhere.

H.A.	Cost of troops in G. plus defence cost in F/E are together insupportable.  One or other must be cut.

K.	This plan is necessary, inter alia, to retain confidence of Europeans in E. Africa.

P.M.	Approve this plan.  Resolve to look for economies elsewhere.

H.A.	No quarrel with priorities – warning only of total position.

	
2.	Commonwealth Immigrants.

R.A.B.	Propose a) re-constitution of Cab. Cttee. in autumn.
		  b) further pressure on W. Indies. esp. Jamaica.

I.M.	Support this approach.
	W.I. Ministers are doing their best.

H.B.	Housing diffies. here are the most you spot.

								[Exit I.M.


		3.	Industrial Relations.

E.H.	After Cab. discussion I spoke to P.M. and consulted employers and workers.

	Former are more f’coming than before.  T.U. leaders can’t get agreed body of support among Unions.

	But 2 sides have now suggested joint mtg. – 7 aside, in a regular forum – on 8 subjects.  They meet on Wed. &amp; I hope we may get some proposals.


		4.	Housing &amp; Rating Policy.

R.A.B.	Summarised recommns.
	Politically tempting to have it alone, but credit to be gained by increasing low council rents.

	Timing is important.  But many points of un-popularity.

H.B.	Must tackle this boldly  Diff. time this winter when 3-year moratorium on rent increases will expire.

	On balance, more support from those who disapprove low council rents than from those who enjoy them.  cf. attitude of Tories on L.C.C.

J.M.	Sorn’s shade remains!  He comes to fruition in ’61, and I am out of time all round.  Am considering with English Dpt. &amp; Ty. wthr. we can move before 1966 on industrial re-rating.

	Nor can I move on house rating.

	On subsidies, I agree : but equally can’t move so soon.
	Must also avoid appearing to damp down essential bldg.

H.A.	Industrial re-rating.  Scotland shd. move as quickly as poss.
	On housing subsidies – agree in principle with this plan but Ty. posn. must be reserved until figures are available.  Hope we can avoid any net increase in Exchequer cost.

	Must advice v. subsidising assocns. bldg. houses to let.  A new commitment at a time when we shd. be undertaking none.
       x/	A small start only is proposed, but if it succeeded it mght run us into a lot of money.  Avoid any public commitment at present.  

H.B.	No ques. of that before autumn.  But hope Dpts. &amp; Ty. can continue to look at it.

		Recommendations approved.  Further thought to x/.


		5.	Coinage Reform.

H.A.	As in memo.

	Possible moves     i) abolish ¼d.  used only in Aberdeen.
			     ii) sound public opinion on size of ½d. and 1d.
	ii) wd. take a long time and involve much change of slot machines.
	Possibly action over 5 years.
			   iii) a possible crown.  Cupro nickel too big.  Real silver under experiment.  Not at present satisfied.

		Approve (i)
		No action on (ii) and (iii).			[Enter C., Att.G.


		6.	Law of the Sea.

K.	As in memo.

S.lL.	V. difficult.  If we made this announcement – i) present Govt. of I. wd. be driven to strong counter measures : might go out of N.A.T.O. : wd. put down resoln. in Sec. Council : R. might send warships to the area : our friends wd. think we were rocking the boat.  We might lose our Norwegian agreement and get into fresh trouble in Faroes.

	Only safe card to play is threat of embargo on landings (by industry).
	Tho’ I can’t promise that this will bring them to negotiate.

J.H.	Our industry are ready to offer negotiations.  I. industry won’t decline to talk.

H.	In addn. to S.lL. fears, I believe Canada wd. repudiate our action.

J.H.	K.’s proposal wd. be consonant with what we said at Geneva – and got wide support for it, for there was general impatience with attitude of I.  Believe we cd. preserve that moral position.

	We shd. be doing no more than to act unilaterally on basis of what we had (almost all) bn. ready to support as a bi-lateral agreement.

	Landings – worth only £½ m. – won’t deter Icelanders.

Att.G.	If we cd. get talks started before 12/8, mght get better co-opn.  As an aid to get them on foot, statement in para.7(b) wd. be helpful.  Doubt if risks mentioned by S.Ll. wd. arise at that stage.

	If we can’t get talks, we shall be forced to accept 12 mile limit, with all its consequences in Norway &amp; Faroes, or to act - with risks involved.

	If we can start talks, they might continue at least until we had secured Norway agreement.

S.Ll.	Confidential approaches from I. Govt. – which suggest that they may be ready to do some sort of deal if they cd. represent it as better from their angle than Communist Govt. achieved in 1958.

	Wd. accept para.7(b) formula for use by the industry – that they wd. press for resumption.

J.H.	You can’t avoid risk of incidents by w’drawing naval protection.
	The trawlers will fish and fight.

P.M.	Industry cd. threaten that too.

	Agreed :	Let the threats be used by the industry.
			Let our Ambassador hint that resumed protection can’t 		be ruled out, tho’ we hope to avoid it.
			Have it in mind that time limit may have to be extended.
