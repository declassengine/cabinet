  <content>C.C.54(60)							18th October 1960


		1.	Foreign Affairs.

		U.N. Assembly.

H.	K. is leaving U.N.  Effect on repves. of smaller countries – frightened of him, but dislike and fear.  He has failed.

	K. pressing still for re-organisation of Secretariat.

	Congo.

	Lumamba losing support – eg. Egypt.  Bomboko’s stock is rising.
	Some hope of stability if U.N. people can work with more reliable of the leaders.

	Egypt.

	Talks with Nasser.  Prospect of normalising relns. – Ambassadors &amp; Consuls.  But N. is putting pressure on Jordan, who are tempted to ??? by fishing in troubled waters in Syria.  N.’s claim J. is part of Syria.

	Congo (contd.)

D.S.	Risk of Ghana promoting a coup : many R. technicians etc., now in Accra.

H.		Doubt this : but must watch it v. carefully.


		2.	Iron &amp; Steel Industry.

S.Ll.	R.T.B. will need up to £200 m.  M/P. £70 : ISRA £20 in cash : where do we get balance.  City won’t raise it by debenture.  Best method is to sell our prior charges, at discounts and hope for compensating profit later on R.T.B. (1962).  E.P.C. agree – best course.

M.	Difficult because of size of R.T.B. need.  City advice is all against action now.

	Driven back on sale of prior charges.
	I warned 1922 Cttee. it wd. be better to p’pone sale of R.T.B.  They will be disappointed, but not surprised.  Ch. Whip agrees.

D.E.	If we take this course, we must make sure of selling the others.  City shd. be prodded.

S.Ll.	Agency advice from City is they shd. be able to sell £75-100 m.

R.A.B.	We had better do it quickly – to avoid pol. criticism.  Also be
             x/	sure of dealing with R.T.B. in this Parlt.

S.Ll.	I agree with x/. but terms of any public promise wd. need thought eg. “intention”.

P.T.	Avoid firm pledge, if possible.
								Memo. approved.


		3.	Pensions:  National Health Stamp etc.   [Enter J.B.C.,  E.P.

P.M.	Related issues : discuss together.

K.	Pensions increase.  Recommend flat-rate increase to take effect from April ’61 when graduated system comes into force.  Nat. Ass. Bd. will recommend related increase in n. assistance rates.

	My Cttee.’s conclns. are not affectted by S.Ll.’s proposal on N.H.S. contns.

J.B.C.	Agree.  N. Ass. increases may be criticised as too low, but we can stand that.  But it is 50% real increase, not compensn. for increased c/l.

S.Ll.	Alternative was 6/= which wd. have left contribn. lower but I agree 7/6 is least we can do.

D.E.	What effect on contributions.

J.B.C.	(Minimum for £9 p.wk. or less : 18/2 as now : man’s 9/9d. (9/11 now).
	At £15 p.wk. increase of 3/6 due &amp; this wd. add 1/5d.  28/4 : 14/10.

Hail.	Unfortunate in light of our promise tht. contribns. lower cpd. 9/11 now paid would fall.

P.M.	How many are left who earn less than £9.

E.H.	Percentage of contribns. to earnings, for lower paid, is awkward.

E.M.	There will be pressure on behalf of rlway annuitants who don’t come in.

J.B.C.	There always is.
	Timing : we can’t have 2 successive alterations in contributions.

		Memo. on Pensions – approved.

	


4.	National Health Service : Contributions.

S.Ll.	Genl. background : increase of nearly £1.000 m. in forecast Estimates up to 1963.  Must therefore consider means of reducing net cost to Ty.
	N.H.S. due to rise by £230 m. up to ’63 (from ’57).
	Agree this is bad tax.  But 78% of cost will still come from taxation : remaining 22% fr. charges and stamp.  Not a bad balance.  Must bring home to contributor that cost must be paid.

	Timing : we shall have to do this before next Election.  Strong case for doing it at once.  £15 p.wk. man goes to 14/10 anyway : this means 5/9 increase via 4/11.  Additional resentment shdn’t be great.  Contracted out man goes up 1/5 anyway : stamp wd. mean 2/3.  Self employed : 1/6, with stamp 2/6 – this normal to temper the wind.

	If we do this now. N.H.S. stamp can be held until after next Election.
	Must relate this proposal to cost of Health Service.

Hail.	We shall be held to what we said in terms of absolute contribns.

P.M.	Beveridge said 20% from contribns.  

S.Ll. 	Even if my plan is accepted it will be only 17½%.

E.P.	Yield of stamp is arbitrarily related to total cost.
	I am aiming at producing lower estimates.  Awkward for me.

H.B.	Awkward in pol. presentn. – esp. if E.P. plans to cut down the Service.  Can’t have both cuts in Service and increase in contns.

E.P.	My argument is tht. if yield eliminates increase in Estimates I have weaker case in pressing for economies.

R.M.	i)  If this is taxation, we can argue on basis of gross cost.
	ii) If this gives room on Budget, politically easier.

R.A.B.	Timing.  Awkward to do it in same Bill, qua. Parlt.  Also politically awkward to do both at once.

S.Ll.	H.A. was told to wait and make the increase at same time as new pension scheme – to avoid 2 increases.  Now I’m told we mustn’t do the 2 together.

P.M.	Prescription charges.  Cd. you ease these to balance stamp?

E.P.	Not comparable.  

E.H.	Party wd. prefer people to pay more thro’ life in contns. rather than on prescriptns. when ill.

P.M.	Argument v regressive tax.  Against this : always bn. thought right tht. contribution shd. be made by beneficiaries.  Practical issue really – look at balance of Budget as a whole.  Anyhow no difference qua. regression betwn. stamp and indirect taxation.

	Can’t press this too far.

	Actually, on last increase there was not much fuss.
	Timing now is perhaps the most important.

         *	Let us have a simple table showing effect on different contributors.
	Real ques. : shd. we be putting too much pressure on this system of spreading cost of N.H.S. between contns. &amp; taxes.

S.Ll.	Never a good time to raise things.  Easy to p’pone.
	Separate Bills can be considered.  Tho’ it wd. still have to come in before Xmas if date of effect is to be April.

Hail.	Can’t we know what economies M/H. intends to get.

P.M.	What kind of measures?

E.P.	Almost any measures designed to reduce expre. cd. be represented as a reduction of service.

D.E.	What effect on economy?			[Exit H., M., D.S., K

P.M.	More diff. to increase stamp after economies in Service.

K.	Cd. we have legn. in May/July taking effect in October?
	This wd. avoid diffies. of timing brought out by J.B.C.

E.H.	Effect on man – much better to get it all over at once.

E.M.	Yes : all experience shows that.

E.H.	Even easier to justify if you look at increasing cost of Social Services as a whole – cf. Education, which must fall on taxpayer.

J.H.	Apl. is a pretty good time qua. wage increases.

P.T.	What about 1/6d. on stamp and abolish prescription charge – also given private patients their drugs.

		Discussion to be resumed.

	
5.	N.H. Service.  Drugs for Private Patients.

E.P.	Pressure for this is increasing.  
R.A.B. 	Yes.  Wd. like to get it out of the way.

R.M.	Runs contrary to all said on Item 4.  How can you now put up this cost of the Service?

E.P.	Pressure for this will increase if contn. is raised.

Ch.H.	Can’t settle this until we know what we intend on stamp.

D.E.	Strongly opposed to this.  V. bad effect on doctors.  Dividing patients.
	Pressure to move to private practice.

Ch.H.	Agree on merits.  But already discussed with B.M.A. – gone v. far.  1949 pledge.  This will give a new M/H. a good start with B.M.A.

J.M.	If we took D.E.’s view, we shd. have to make our position plain.

P.T.	Yes – and soon.

R.A.B.	I favour it, on merits.

H.B.	No way of avoiding it.

Ch.H.	Still hope it can be combined with something else.  Awkward to present £2½ m. increase alone.

	There is no sound medical or social case for this – it is solely financial and expediency.

		Discussion to be resumed.
