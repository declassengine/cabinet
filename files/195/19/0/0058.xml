  <content>C.C.41(61)							20th July 1961


		1.	Foreign Affairs.				[Enter M.R.

H.	a)	Tunis.  Bizenta is not N.A.T.O. base – no oblign. to go to assistance of 
	French.  It is also under Tunisian sovereignty.  B. has taken it to Sec. Council.

	V. awkward situation.  Must consider our line.

	b)	Laos.  Confce. resumed – on compromise basis.  Fairly good.

	
2.	Parliament.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.
	Wed./Thurs. debate on economic sitn. following S.Ll.’s statement on Tuesday.  On Govt. motion.  Terms approved.
	House will press for debate on Common Market.
	P.M. statement on Monday 31/7 : debate on Tues. or Wedy.

H.	E.H must be in Paris Tues. For W.E.U. Debate must therefore be on Wedy.

R.A.B.	Shall announce today hope to rise on 3/8.
	Only difficulty still outstanding = Stansgate.  May be demand for debate in last week, after result of court’s sitting.
	Cab. must discuss Joint Cttee.

	
3.	Post Office Tariffs.			[Enter P.M.G.

S.Ll.	Consistent with policy in W. Paper.  Avoids P.O. becoming dependent on Exchequer for cost of investment.

P.M.G.	Parcels : most are low weight.  If we had graduated increase we shdn’t make the service viable.  But most light parcels will now go by letter post.

S.Ll.	Add to statement – need to avoid sharp increase in P.O. dependence on Exchequer for investment expenditure.	Agreed.

		Agreed:  Ch. H. to agree final draft with P.M.G. &amp;
			  Fin. Secy.

			  Statement Monday 24/7.

	
4.	Economic Situation.				[Enter E.P., R.W.

S.Ll.	How do we present this crisis?  Can mention drain on reserves.
	But main strain is expenditure – Estimated £1150 m.  (740 Personal 120 public investment 300 private) increased expenditure : will create unmanageable boom.

	Worst sitn. since devaluation.  Floating rate : not fr. weakness.
	Oversea expenditure : shall announce decn. to apply to N.A. Council for relief under W.E.U. Treaty.  Proclaim intn. to try to hold exp. to £400 m. p.a.  Ceiling or aid : £180 M.

	Adminve. expenditure : directive.  Want also to mention that.
	Credit restrictions : shall decide Mon. betwn. 3 choices.  There will be call for special deposits : and restn. of lending for specified purposes not directly related to productive effort.

	Powers will be taken if vol. appeal fails.

	Regulator 1. at 10%
	Public expre.		i)  apply Wh. Paper policy on natd. industries.
				ii) education : may reach agreed formula :
				    investment next year not to exceed level of 			    this.
Shd we announce at same time we won’t go
above 14% on teachers’ salaries. 
				iii) housing – agreed formula.
				iv) health : restrict growth/expenditure to 2½%.
				v)  roads : agreed 5 yr. p’mme.
E.M.	 “far short” is new?

S.Ll.	May not want to mention this in 				     statement.
				vi) assistance to priv. industry : over lump : £75 			     m. less next year than this.
J.M.	Add refce. to contd. assistance to areas of special unemployment.

	Current expenditure – on lines of para. 17 of C.107.
	Tho’ we go up 2½% above line, we can cover that below.
	Warning to Cabinet : bids for Estimates show £384 m. increase.
	Can bring that down to £225 m. by normal means.  Can we get another £100 m.?  Wd. mean adjustment of Fam. allowances (£35 m. if 2nd child is taken out).  Wd. mean cutting increase in defence p’mme (now £100 m. : only 27 m. of wh. can be saved by M/Defence).  Apart from defence, it means substantial contn. fr. Social Service field.  Must have assurance from Cab. on this if I am to say we aim to contain increase w’in 2½%.

	Agriculture : formula still to be agreed with C.S.
	Section on wages &amp; planning.  Pause of at least 12 months in wage increases.  Govt. propose to follow that policy in sector which they control – w’out saying in advance tht. we will repudiate arbitn.  “Better arrangemts. needed for co-ordinn. of econ. planning” &amp; propose to discuss with industry (both sides) next week.

	Ty. &amp; Bank doubt if all this is enough to restore confidence.
	Alternative addns. – i) 6d. on income tax ii) variation of purchase tax. (below 50% range).  iii) 6d. on petrol (£80 m). iv) Second regulator a) at 4/=  b) with rebate for exports c) threat to have it in Nov. unless sitn. improves.  My own judgement is v. using it because it has bn. so widely criticised.  Will seek Cab. decn. on this Mon. – if I want to use it.

P.M.	B/E. fear this package won’t serve our purposes – i) get substantial drawing from I.M.F.  ii) face showdown on a wages claim in 2 mos. or so.  Must strengthen our posn. in order to fight that.

	Main test, for foreign opinion, is our determination to contain our expenditure.

R.M.	Hope S.Ll. will find some means of taxing capital gains so as to enable us to hold wages w’out reversing sensible decn. on surtax.  Policy not complete so long as short term capital gains escape taxation.

I.M.	Agree.  W’out this, it will seem weighted v. lower income groups.

S.Ll.	Two choices.  i) full scale capital gains tax.  V. gt. adminve. task for I.R.  Many exceptions – jewellery, pictures, furniture : first house : set off losses : sliding scale.  Most ingenious brains wd. find methods of evasion.
			ii) bring short term capital gains into ordinary tax 			system.

H.W.	Want something wh. will hit large operators.

J.H.	Agree : wd. put package into balance.

H.B.	Will come up over land values – debate today.  Can’t be tackled w’out nationalisation or somethg. like (ii) above.

Hail.	Need for moral content to this package.  Discipline, patriotism &amp; efficiency are needed.  Capital gains tax is symbol of this.

M.	ii) wd. mean that some people wd. pay almost whole in tax/surtax.

P.M.	Cd. S.Ll. repeat – opposed to c.g. tax in full concept, but considering something less on basis of taxing profits arising from short-term changes in investment, wthr. in land or in stocks.

R.A.B.	Much prefer that ii) be pursued.  Must reject i).  Favour formula on lines proposed by P.M.

Ch.H.	We need statement of determination to find practical scheme on lines of  (ii).

Hail.	Doubts about touching family allowances.

E.H.	What other measures do B/E. favour for steadying immediate position?

S.Ll.	In Paris they said “takes £500 m. off demand”.  These measures may reduce £1150 estimate to £700.  If there is a pause on wages, these measures may suffice.

D.E.	Even now, too much money.  All therefore turns on stopping this 5% increase in wages.  If we can’t, package isn’t enough.
	Must grasp wages issues as firmly as possible.
	Worried about bldg.  Is voluntary restraint of lending enough?
	Shd. we not back this with threat of bldg. control in autumn if vol. appeal is not effective?

	Wages in public sector.  2 years via 1?  Or something on arbitn.
	Teachers’ salaries.  Ready to tell l.a.s. who have offered £48 m. we can’t go above £43 m.

	Also tht. we must in future have means of expressing Govt. views on amount and distribn.

Ch.H.	3 weaknesses	i)   capital gains.
			ii)  Wages pause – esp. in reln. to public sector.
			iii) Element of growth in our community : resolve to 		tackle &amp; practices by labour.  Cd. we look again at a 		general remedy : a Commission.
			
Hail.	Amory’s reference in H/L. to “Citrine” plan.

P.T.	Diffy. nature of crisis is not obvious to public.
	Is this package enough?  To try &amp; fail wd. be worst of all.
	Depends on	a) Bank rate.  If any change shd. be significant.
			b) Expenditure.  Will he be confident tht. he can hold it.  		That is essential.		

	“Better co-ordination”.  Avoid open indictment of Tory record.
	Real trouble is not that, but excessive strain we have all put on demand.

	Wages.  Advice, exhortn. or suggn. of pause – no effect.  The only safeguard is fear of employers tht. they can’t grant increase.  That depends on effect of total of our measures : they have to total £500 m. &amp; assurance tht. base doesn’t rise while measures are taken.

P.M.	Summed up.

	Some promise on capital gains (ii).
	Further considn. on bldg. control.  Some threat of taking powers on this, if credit restriction doesn’t do the trick.

	A general powers Bill – for this and for Berlin.

S.Ll.	Worried at Depl. attitude towards expenditure.  Anxiety to complete p’mmes etc.  We need more restrictive attitude.

								[Exit R.W., P.M.G.

						[Enter Att. G. Ld. Adv.

		5.	Local Government : Greater London.	

R.A.B.	As in memo.

H.B.	Cd. Cab. take note of this : authorise me to submit draft of W. Paper : &amp; take decns. on that.

P.M.	Cdn’t present this before recess.

H.B.	I’m under great pressure.

R.A.B.	Cd. publish during summer, in the recess.

		Agreed :  M/Housing to submit drafts of White Paper.

							[Exit E.P.


		6.	Trade Union Elections.

J.H.	Wrote to T.U.C. &amp; announced this in reply to P.Q. y’day.
	Doubt if T.U.C. will take effective action; but may be gives me chance to take up conversations with T.U.’s late.

	Woodcock’s re-action v. violent.  Said this was E.T.U. only and T.U.C. will deal with theme – tho’ he admitted few powers.
	In view of this violent reaction, don’t wish to be tied now to any particular type of legn..  Wish to be free to talk to T.U.’s at large.

	Favour plan by wh. individual T.U. members shd. have some sort of protection via Registrar as shareholders in a company have.

	The 2 proposals of Att.G., tho’ logical &amp; reasonable, wd. prob. be taken by T.U.’s as major attack on their freedom.

Att.G.	If we are to have a row with T.U.C., we must have a plan which is effective.  Two essentials : i) rules must be intelligible : ii) conduct of elections must be in accordance with rules.

	J.H. plan only gives Registrar same power as Cts. now have.
	Expansion for plaintiff – and no legal aid.

I.M.	Att. G. para.3.  I didn’t intend to suggest examn. by a Judge.
	J.H.’s approach can be based on E.T.U. case.  But, if we want to go further, we want wider base : which mght be an enquiry by a Judge.

J.H.	Some enquiry, perhaps, at some stage : but not by a Judge to wh. T.U.’s are allergic.

	If I can get calm talk with T.U.C., I wd. be ready to put Att.Gen;’s proposals to them.  They might well then accept mine!

E.M.	Get views of Labour M.P.’s who are T.U.  Their re-action may be wiser than that of T.U.C.

J.H.	Labour in H/C. are divided.  Some fear row with T.U.C.

Hail.	We need also to wait &amp; see what T.U.C. do about E.T.U.

	If E.T.U. election in Sept. goes wrong, public opinion will demand much more effective action.

D.S.	Act before public interest drops.

	
7.	British Sugar Corporation.

C.S.	In present circs. Bd. have agreed to hold posn. (at 7%) despite any repn. by shareholders.		Agreed.


		8.	British Transport Commission.

E.M.	Clore is trying to take over Carter Paterson.  B.T.C. is under statutory oblign. to sell.  On pol. grounds  I propose to refuse – alleging I can get a higher price.
