		1.	Foreign Affairs.				[Enter M.R.

		a)	Congo.

H.	Debate in U.N. beginning today.  Kasav. will be there – recognised by Sec.Genl. as the 30 commrs. are not in N.Yk. this accepted by Africans on the spot.  Disintegratn. threatening – K.’s opportunity.  U.N. attitude to commrs. is prob. due to fear tht. African States mght w’draw their troops.

	Debate will reflect objns. to return of B. technicians &amp; demand to allow Parlt. to re-assemble.  Latter wd. mean return to Lubumba.
	A majority resoln. in favour of Kasav. wd. steady posn. (but wd. prob. be opposed by some Africans, incldg. Ghana and Nigeria).  Favour this, accepting risk in (  ).  Reasonable chance of getting a majority.  Proper repn. in U.N. wd. be a gt. help.

I.M.	Believe most African States would oppose : a serious matter : but on balance I favour it.

H.	Kasav. is at least properly elected President.

P.M.	Cd. prs. be represented as tempy. expedient while enquiry into constitution is made.  

H.	Second is fall back posn. if resoln. is lost.

S.Ll.	Cd. you not have both, simultaneously.

P.M.	Temporary diffies. with Ghana etc. are outweighed by risk of chaos &amp;
R. intervention.  But try to combine two plans.

		b)	Egypt.

H.	Hope we can exchange names of Ambassadors on 1/12.  Hope we can keep ques. of Consulates separately.

		c)	Iceland.

H.	Hope of agreement slightly more favourable to us than 12 miles.
	Anderson is more reasonable.

		d)	W. Indies : Bases.

I.M.	Talks went v. well.  Communiqué to be issued tomorrow.  U.S. have bn. v. reasonable.  Bi.lateral discns. with W. Indies will follow in 2 wks. in Trinidad.
 
		2.	Federation of Rhodesia etc.

P.M.		Corrce. with Welensky v publn. of private assurances.  Offered to 			present Wh. Paper : but drew attn. to dangers of breachg. rule v. publn. 		of confidential exchanges.  W. has now said he does not press for
	publn..  On the whole, I’m content – tho’ imputns. of bad faith may continue here.

	Will tell Hail. what to say in H/L. debate on 16/xii – when I know what Wel. says.  P.M. to discuss with Hail and D.S.

	
3.	Parliament.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.

	
4.	Floods.

P.M.	£3 m. was not used on last occasion : cd. be used now.

S.Ll.	National Fund a) Wd. decrease local subscriptions   b) wd. discourage insurance, activities of River Boards etc.  Prefer therefore to support local funds.

H.B.	People’s immediate needs are being met, in cash or kind.  Big claims on a fund mature much later.

	Agree with S.Ll., on balanace.  Tho’ wd. be willing to defer final decision for a time.  Don’t accept all S.Ll.’s arguments : but doubt wthr. much response wd. be f’coming for a national fund.

	
5.	National Service.

H.W.	Least publicity the better.

J.H.	Parlt. must be informed.

P.M.	Wd. answer to PQ suffice?  Omitting 2 final paras. of draft.

J.H.	Ungracious?  

H.W.	Awkward for those still serving.  

C.S.	Better to defer the thanks until the last man is out.

P.M.	Anyway, don’t have 3rd para.

Ch.H.	Stet 4 in para.  Shorten 2nd and 3rd paras.  And give it as Written Answer.    

M.R.	I agree.

		Agreed :	P.Q. for Written Answer on lines proposed by 			Ch. H.  J.H. and Ch. Whip and Ch. Hill to settle 			terms of reply.

	
6.	Liquor Licensing Bill.

R.A.B.	Ready to accept plan of H.B.

J.M.	So am I – tho’ it will increase my diffies.

	
7.	Constitutional Development of Commonwealth.

D.S.	Nothing to add to my memo.  I welcome variety.

I.M.	a)	Begin to think Mauritius will be stronger candidate – 600.000 and v. rapidly growing popn.  Wd. add them among ‘possibles’.

		b)	Wd. like authy. to show Rpt. to Govrs.

P.M.	Shd. we tell them now we have accepted it?  Mght be thought we were trying to cut short discn.  Put it on Agenda, merely.
