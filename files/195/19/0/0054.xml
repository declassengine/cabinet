		Economic Situation.			[Enter B-C., R.W., P.M.G., 
							 M.R., Rippon.

P.M.	Gravity of situation.  Need for non-Departmental approach.  Secrecy.

S.L.I.	Statistical posn. on reserves – current &amp; prospectives.  Debt to central Banks (£400 m.)  Reserve by end ’61 wd. be down to £250 m.  We cd. draw £500 m. from F.M.  But estimated further fall of £300 m. or so next year.  This assumes no further outflow of volatile sterling Banks in own interest, are determined to help.  They accept that, if £ went dollar wd. follow.  But, unless long term trend adjusted this wd. merely increase in indebtedness.

	Devaluation must be discarded – lasting damage : break up of st. area.
	On that line, most we cd. do wd. be to let it float : tho’ that wd. be highly awkward.  I. Oversea expenditure.

	We must now recognise we shan’t get exports to cover oversea expendre. of £500 m. + outflow of capital.  1958 was £350 only : 1962 likely to be £500.  Want to say we will hold it to £400 m. as fixed limit.

	i)	Germany.  £75 m. in N.A.T.O. area.  We must say (not soon because 
	of Berlin) we wdn’t pay more than £25 m. across exchanges.  (P.M. May not be that formula).

H.W.	I wd. prefer a changed military strategy.  That wd. not be hopeless.

S.L.I..	ii) 	Mil. expre. elsewhere.
	iii)	Aid.  Colonies £83.  C.D.C. £19 m.  Doms. £55.  Foreign £13.  U.N. 		Fund £6.  1 DA £4.  Total 180 m.  44 tied, the rest is not : tho’ most
	spent in U.K.

	Propose to fix £180 m. as ceiling for next year.
	iv)	Misc. £48 m. (not 43).  Pensions can’t be touched : but %age cut over 		the rest.

I.M.	Remember that much “aid” is sledged – eg. compensation to O.C.S.

H.	%age cut in reln. to Embassies means re-organising – combining 2 into 1 or cutting out repve.

	Import Controls.

S.L.I..	Powers exist : but adm. machinery wd. need to be re-created.  Wd. take 2 months and wd. provoke fore-stalling.

	Moreover, wd. inflation be helped by reducing available good.
		Cdn’t extend to food, w’out rationing.  

R.A.B. 	Think we shd. have this.

M.		Undesirable imports - luxuries.  Weapons.

H.W.	Presentationally : we shd. seem to be doing something.

D.E.	Only practical way now is floating rate.  Otherwise, forestalling.

	Travel Allowances.

S.L.I.	Inexpedient to cut save on next travel year.
	Saving of £20 m. in full year if cut to £50 p.a.

	Oversea Investment.

S.L.I.	Must indicate greater discipline here.  Gt. diffies.  But must have some restriction.

	Remittance of profits.  No compulsion : scope for exhortation.
	Might explore possibility tht. if returned here, profits wd. be taxed only if distributed.

D.E.	If you restrict export of fresh capital, you will encourage them not to remit profits – for they will want to leave their profits in the oversea country against need to expand their business.

Hail.	At least, we still have the machinery of control.

S.L.I.	Only outside st. area.  Don’t propose to extend it.  Mght get some vol. co-opn. on this.  

M. 	Unless you discourage it, it will increase – eg. Unilever in Nigeria.

	Invisibles.

S.L.I.	Shipping earnings dropped by £40 m.  Hard to see how we can give substantial help.

E.M.	My Dpt. shd. do more.  We can afford to discriminate, now we are a net importer of shipping.  Am considering whch countries are best candidates for retaliation.

	Also, consider condn. tht. aid shd. go in B.ships.

	II.	Reduction of House Demand.

S.L.I.	Consumption likely to rise by £400 m. – 4%.
	Long term : C(61) 88.  Must refer to this in statement &amp; better to give examples (para.19).

	V. hard even to hold expendre. at 42.5% of G.D.P.
	Avoid promising impossible.

	Public Investment.  P’mmes have gathered momentum, &amp; spending has overtaken estimates.  Adjustments shd. fit in with long-term p’mme.

	Bank rate.  Wd. be sign of weakness abroad.

	H.Purchase.  Wd. hit industries wh. are not over loaded.

	Bank advances.  Rising steeply again.  Must be checked.

	Capital Issues .  More harm than good to confidence.

M/M.R.	Wd. not work anyway.

	Wages and Salaries.  No more to say.

H.	Economic Growth.  This, surely, is where Govt. have failed.  Tax incentives for exports?

M.	Wages surely in Kermil.  We can’t accept 6-7% round of increases.

S.L.I.	Agree.  We must take a stand : and create climate/opinion.

P.M.	Public Sector.  Direct employers : we are limited by arbitration.
	Indirect : l.a. employer : can Govt. recover control?
	Natd. industries : we can influence and cd. do more.
	Employers in private sector wd. be encouraged if we were seen to be standing firm in public sector.

	But must also create economic climate, in wh. demand is falling – so that boom condns. are averted.

K.	Empty chair : national inerest not prepd. in wage negotiations.
	Coppi failed.  We shd. seek another &amp; more effective means.

I.M.	An ounce of action is worth a ton of exhortation.
	Bus strike : N.HS. clerks : had a real impact.
	Empty chair can’t be filled.

	What we need is a good example tht. Govt. will stand firm.

Hail.	Can you in fact hold wages when there are more jobs than applicants.

E.M.	No harm in increased wages if increase in productivity too.
	But look at shipbldg : we aren’t competing even v. countries with higher wages eg. Sweden &amp; Germany.

H.B.	Low standard of management in U.K.
		III Times-table.

S.L.I.	On any package, 1st regulator must be used – prob. to full extent.
	1.5 points on c/l. index.

	Earliest date for passage of Fin. Bill = 19/vii.  Earliest date for statement wd. be 20/vii.

D.E.	V. near to worst collapse of £.
	Must therefore select measures obviously designed to protect £.  B/p. must be criterion.  Doubt if we can get thro’ w’out floating rate.
	Cdn’t afford to do that unless seen to be taking drastic action.
	Must reduce dom. demand savagely : attack consumption : appear to discriminate in favour of productive techniques.  If we are paying too much wages, we must seem to be doing all possible on that.  P. sector cd. give example.  Appalling size of public emplt.  Say only 1% p.a. increase in public salaries over 2-3 years.
	
	Teachers : we are too far down the road to do much.  If 2 sides agree on 16%, I cd. reject it : insist on £575 at outset : awful row.

	Strengthen Budget surplus.  1st regulator.  Need as near £1.000 m. surplus as we can.

	Policy of cuts for sake of b/p. won’t be understood.  Must find an appeal – if people are to go on working.  Are there things for wh. people wd. pay increased taxation – i) law &amp; order ii) most of education p’mme iii) aid to oversea countries.  Wd. give room for bigger cuts in other directions.  Wages &amp; salaries = crux.  More chance of responsibility there if b/p. crisis can be brought home, as floating rate would do.

	Agriculture.  Ty. proposal is wrong.  Doesn’t follow that workers wd. move into exporting industries.

C.S.	Must re-arrange support system – transfer burden to consumer.
	But Ty. propose ceiling for subsidies.  Cause of rise : increased prodn. : falling world prices because of surpluses.

	Ty. plan wd. mean 20% drop in farm increase and no increase in food prices.

P.M.	Only immediate action = anti-dumping order.

R.M.	Barley.  Dumping by R. and others.  Must make anti-dumping order early next week : in spite of effect in R. trade fair.

Hail.	Lack of powers.  Shall have to re-enact.  Take this chance.
	Keep Parlt. sitting in Aug. to pass a Bill.
R.M.	But only relevant power would be control of wages and salaries!
	Don’t exaggerate sitn. – wealth depends on industry not finance.
	Favour floating rate.  Wd. suit our economy.
	Gap under discn. is w’in rate of increase in nat. income.
	Slow deterioration in our competitive power is real cause.
	Fr. cured that by devaluation, increased competitive climate for industry &amp; firm stand on wages.  We shd. do the same.

	Dramatic action.

G.R.	What is to be said.  Worst example to give wd. be supersonic aircraft.
	We commissioned report (£1 m.) : stupid not to wait for it.

J.M.	Support R.M.
	Deptl. diffies. : agric : recruitment of teachers.

P.M.	Overseas mil. expre.  Awkward tht. Alliances are separate : each is selfish : N.A.T.O. disregards what we are spending elsewhere.

	
2.	Kuwait.

H.	Ruler has given written request for support.
	U.S. have promised moral support.
	Oppn. warned : hoped we shall have some Arabs with us.

P.M.	Awkward timing : if we go in, Q. cd. refrain from attacking &amp; then seize Iraq oil fields.

	Def. Cttee. will consider.


	1. (resumed)  Economic Situation.

H.	Public announcement re £25 m. in G. wd. destroy our influence over Berlin crisis.  Cd. be pest to N.A. Council.

P.M.	What then are we to say?

H.W.	N.A.T.O. pool won’t work for us : we are getting more in dollars than we spend in G.

	W.E.U. Treaty : cd. we abrogate that?
	Given time we might save £40 m. or more outside G.  W’in G. only course is to press G. to pay.

S.L.I.	We can go to N.A.T.O. under W.E.U. Treaty, because of b/p. diffies.

P.M.	Cd. we say : we will stand thro’ autumn &amp; winter crisis over Berlin : but we give notice tht. from Apl 62 we shan’t pay this over exchanges.  Shall seek relief, under terms of W.E.U. Treaty.

	Must have some public statement end/July to steady confidence.
