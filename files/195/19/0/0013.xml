  <content>C.C.45(60)							25th July 1960


		1.	Foreign Affairs.				[Enter M.R.

		a)	Congo.

S.Ll.	Shall take line in H/C. that first need is to restore law &amp; order.

H.	Genl. Akyanan went to N.York &amp; has submitted his resignation to NK.

H.W.	Commando was to have gone from Aden to Kenya : can’t go because of potential troubles in Aden : propose therefore to send a battn. from here, in aircraft which are going out in any event.


		2.	European Economic Co-operation.

H.A.	Talks went well.  Fr. &amp; U.S. more helpful than we feared.  Sufficient favourable progress to justify communiqué.  Sec. Genl. appointed – who will become S. Genl. of O.E.E.C. – a Danish ex Minister of Finance, Christiansen.

	Better spirit than we had expected.


		3.	Parliament.

M.R.	Return 25/10.  Prorogue 27/10.  New Session 1/11.  To be announced today.

	
4.	Agriculture : Farm Improvement Scheme.	[Enter D. Vosper.

P.M.	As in brief.

H.A.	In my public statements in Parlt. as M/Ag., I did reserve right to slow it down if it went too far.

	Effects i) increasing quantum of production because of increased efficiency.  Symbolic of effects of policy – cost exceeding estimates.  If that continues, it must mean taxation higher in propn. to g.n.p.  I therefore feel it necessary to bring all such cases to notice of Cabinet.
	In cases where we can revise our policies, we shd. do so : and on this our hands are free, if we wish to face pol. difficulties involved.

S.Ll.	Cd. we not control it administratively – not more than £5 m. a year for next 2 or 3 years.

J.H.	i)  This enables us to be tougher in annual reviews.
	ii) Tho’ our right to reduce was reserved, farmers assume it will run for 10 years at annual rate required – not at maximum of £50 m.
	iii) Adminn. cd. delay the grants, but not the applns.  We shall have a backlog.

D.E.	Wd. import discrimination between one claim or another – unless you merely had a waiting list &amp; that wd. cause gt. resentment.
	Increased food prodn. = a healthy form of export subsidy.

H.A.	Cd. you find a compensating cut in the production grants.  They have risen by £30 m. or more over past 4 years or so.

J.H.	Para.8.  During that period we have required farmers to abort £90 m. of increased costs.

H.	Better to reduce ploughing grants?

Hail.	£3 m. p.a. is surely a sum wh. cd. save on a Price Review.

D.V.	In N.I. applns. are being delayed in expectn. that grant will continue for 10 years.  They wd. be penalised if %age were now reduced.

P.M.	Better, surely, to avoid reducing %age.  Reserve final decision until Price Review, &amp; see what we can do in the way of compensating savings.

H.A.	We shall need to know what figure to put in Estimates.

P.M.	Dangerous to alter percentage.
	M/Ag. to consider i) possibility of slowing expendre.
		by adminve. means ii) compensating economies on 					production grants etc., or otherwise in Price Review.

								[Exit D.V.

	
5.	Information Services : S. America.

Ch.H.	Two parts.  Second part I will take up with Ministers concerned and Ch/Exch.

P.M.	V. interesting.
	Fear tht. after Africa, Communist pressure will turn to S. America.

S.Ll.	Value of Ch. H.’s visit.

Ch. H.	Serious loss – disappearance of Reuters.  Fear they have no chance of getting back.

	General warmth to U.K. – readiness to welcome us.

D.S.	Confirm that from recent personal experience.


		6.	Economic Situation.  B/Payments.

H.A.	E.P.C. will be holding a 2nd discussion.  Have asked Ty. for memo. on capital exports.

	Para.13 of covering memo.  Shd. be : “or an attempt in present circs. to restrict private investment &amp; lending in the sterling area”.
	Shd. not exclude resln. of Govt. lending overseas – that may well need action.

K.	Para.25 of report.  Seek elucidation.

H.A.	Kuwait gap stopped.  But a new one thro’ H. Kong : may be only a temporary development.  Accounts for larger part of the £45 m. mentioned in report.  Shall submit memo. to E.P.C. on this.
	Increased demand for Commonwealth assistance loans.

P.M.	Alarmed by signs of recession in U.S. eg. steel.

R.M.	Not typical of U.S. production as a whole.  

H.A. 	U.S. steel v. mercurial.

I.M.	Main oversea investment is private – wh. we can’t control.
	Example of cutting back on public investment.  Singapore wants £20 m. and is offered £4 m.  : they will turn to R.

	Lesson : we ought to get more resources for oversea development.  Obvious source is Germany : &amp; our mil. expenditure is surely a card we can play.

H.A.	This was object of the internatl. assistance group.  So far, it has produced little result.  G. has done nil. save loan to Dev. Bank.  Whether we shd. threaten on basis of our £60 m. mil. expenditure in G. must be considered in N.A.T.O. context.

H.W.	Am preparing memo. on where our oversea mil. expenditure falls.

E.H.	Serious long-term trend.  Assumptn. of £300-400 m. surplus.
	Average of 10 years shows £130 m. short-fall on average.  We have never come near our target.  Reserves are never strong enough for stability &amp; we are forced to use interest rate, with its serious internal consequences.  Re-assessment of whole situation is needed.

D.E.	Increased rate of private investment overseas.  Rests on a judgement.  We shd. see tht. attractions of investment in U.K. are increased.
	Para.13 suggests remedy of restraint at home.  But that will make it even more attractive to invest abroad.  Here is our dilemma.  How keep dynamism of own market &amp; at same time preserve our posn. abroad?  i) Less imports : agric. cd. help.  ii) more exports.  iii) discriminatory measures to increase attractions of investment overseas.

M.       )	Increased pressure of our exports brings risk tht. some countries will 
H.W.   )	force you to manufacture there instead of exporting from here.

D.E.	Accept that.  Need for a new look.  May be we cd. get a better credit balance by balancing trade at a lower level : balancing trade at highest possible level may be out-moded.

H.A.	You may be right : but v. hard to determine at what level : how to do it.

	Corollary of our present premise : we must be competitive.

P.M.	Can we improve presentation?  Periodical statements include nothing on invisibles – or oversea investments &amp; assets.

H.A.	Better than it was.  Will consider what more we cd. do.


		7.	North British Locomotive Company.

R.M.	The industry is too large : in long run, when it contracts, this is the firm which will go.  No economic case.

J.M.	Means tht. another industry making for natd. industry will be concentrated in the south.  Admit firm has bad history : but new Chairman is efficient &amp; believes tht. with time, he can get it round &amp; diversified.  New factor : assurance of share in 62/63 p’mme wd. enable him to hang on.

E.M.	B.T.C. don’t want these (obsolete) diesels.  The new model is 10% cheaper to buy and to run.  They will order only if Govt. pay.

P.M.	Unemplt. rate in Glasgow is 3.2%.
	Will rlways manufacture for themselves?  Wdn’t matter to local emplt. in Swindon or Rugby – it cd. switch.

M.	Perhaps rlways shd. make less of their requirements – but will take time to decide that.  Wrong to keep this firm artificially alive m’while.

H.A.	Disastrous effect on morale of rlways if we required them to buy less economic locos.  No assurance they will get new orders, on competitive tenders.

J.H.	Plain that the industry is too big.

J.M.	This is not a place to cut.  South &amp; rlway workshops shd. take the knock.

P.M.	Real trouble is : how can we force B.T.C. to do uneconomic thing when S.A.G. is at work &amp; we’ve said what we have about the efficiency of rlway planning.

E.H.	Hope Dpts. concerned with natd. industries will review location of their suppliers.

J.M.	May I discuss with E.M. i) wthr. existing types are as bad as claimed and ii) what prospects of the new order.

E.M.	On ii) best course is to have M/T. offl. present at mtgs. between B.T.C. and Co.

P.M.	Any support to keep Co. going shd. be based on prospect of their putting in competitive tender for new types.
