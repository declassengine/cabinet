C.C.52(60)							6th October 1960


		1.	Queen’s Speeches.			[Enter M.R. and L.

		a)	Prorogation.

		Approved subject to amendment.

		b)	Opening.

		Approved subject to amendment.
								[Exit L.


		2.	Duke &amp; Duchess of Gloucester : Silver Wedding.

R.A.B.	Nov. 6.  Telegram will suffice.  P.M. thinks a present is unnecessary.

D.S.	A bouquet with written message from P.M. via telegram.

		Agreed.


		3.	East African Building Societies.

K.	Mtg. of Ministers this morning.  I.M. wants Govt. support for 2 bldg. societies in Kenya, whose posn. is threatened by lack of confidence in future of Europeans in Kenya.

	Ty. diffies. were put to us by Econ. Secy.  Hope S.Ll. will consider this in light of our discussion; and allow Cab. to consider it later.

R.A.B.	May have to meet on Mon. or Tuesday.


		4.	North British Locomotive Company.

S.Ll.	My memo. gives factual posn.  True that if this firm collapses we shall lose £1¾ m. of Ty. money – in addn. to 3.000 unemployed in Glasgow.

E.M.	B.T.C. think tht. to divert part of contract wd. involve breach of faith to other tenderers – and wd. also increase price for remainder.
	B.T.C. are unwilling to consider this firm because of price, delivery dates and past performance.

R.M.	Introdn. of new condns., after tenders invited, wd. be disturbing to industry generally.

M.	I agree.

S.Ll.	So do I : in spite of my £1¾ m. it wd. be wrong to put pressure on B.T.C. – esp. at this time.

E.M.	No other firms in dev. areas have tendered – nor have B.T.C. w’shops.

J.M.	Accept tht. special scheme can’t be applied here w’out impropriety.

		Agreed  :  no special action.


		5.	British N. American Act.

K.	i)	May be comment on appln. to existing Judges.  Can’t do anything on 	that.  ii) In future they shd. consult Parly. Counsel on drafting of the 	legislation.

	
6.	Education : Grants to Students.

R.A.B.	Difficult issue, on which division of opinion.  Immediate ques. is what we shd. say at Party Conference.  Not easy to settle this in a hurry.

D.E.	i)	Financial.
  
a) Ty. agree to drastic relaxation of test.  Cost of abolition wd. therefore be less than stated in Ty. memo. – which relates to present test.  Assumg. we wd. in any event go as far as minority – figures wd. be 5½ and 3½ m. only.
b) Repercussions – how far do they go?  I cd. limit it to full 	time courses leading to somethg. comparable to a Univ. degree.  viz., teacher-training colleges and full time technological.
		c) Must know before we open discns. on genl. grant.
ii)	Social.  Need for drive for higher education – for industry, exports etc. Lack of money must not prevent good people from taking advantage of opportunities we provide.

	a)  We know tht. decision to keep 2nd child at grammar school often turns on wthr. money has to be provided for elder child at Univ.
	b) Distortion because of children going to Univ. nearest home.
	c) Married women won’t come back to teaching for fear of increasg. income to point where they get no grant for Univ. educn. for children.
	d) 1944 Act put ability before birth and wealth.  This principle is not yet in operation after 18.  Why put means test there when it’s not available elsewhere.  I want to be able to sue a parent who won’t send child to Univ.

iii)	Political.  Can’t find any opinion in favour of continuing means test.  	Even H.M.C. voted against by 94 to 6.

	We must treat young people over 18 as independent.
	I think it essential to say at Party Conference tht. we accept in principle the need to abolish means test.

S.Ll.	i)	Financial.  Agree cost is not v. large.  But can we measure cost of accepting principle tht. after 18 no parental responsibility continues.  Not education only.

ii)	Social.  Don’t accept argument.  Selection for Universities will pass to State.  Pass. men make big contribn.  Posn. of independent &amp; direct grant schools will be undermined - on principle tht. all educn. must be compulsorily free.

iii)	Will this relieve people?  About half of the parents wd. be no better off taking a/c of w’drawal of tax concession.  Has this been realised by those who urge abolition?  We must have more time to assess actual consequences.  Ty. might produce alternative means of relieving lower income parents.

R.A.B.	Want Ty. memo. on a) total cost b) tax relief (tables) c) an alternative scheme.

S.Ll.	Yes : tho’ not before Scarboro’

R.A.B.	Then what can be said at Scarboro’.

Hail.	What about paras 8-9, which D.E. hasn’t answered.

R.A.B.	We certainly need time.

H.B.	Point on general grant discn.  No urgency if there is to be legn. on this.
	But we shd. reach a decision in October.

		Agreed :	D.E. and S.Ll. to issue formula for use at 				Scarboro’.

							[Enter E.P. and Bevins.
	
7.	Investment Programme.

R.A.B.	Publication.  Prefer to p’pone until Mon. after 27/10. – in spite of help it might give in debate on that delay.

	Para.52.  Don’t commit ourselves to P.O. legn. this session.

B.	No change of wording is necessary.

S.Ll.	Will warn Dpts. of last date for amendments.

		Approved.
