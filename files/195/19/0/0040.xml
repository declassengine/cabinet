		1.	Laos.						[Enter Perth, M.R.

H.W.	Seato plan 5/61.

	Pretty slow.  POL n. of Bankok is v. limited.  We cdn’t go further than 300 m. south of frontier.  If fwd. damage were establd. : our first contn. wd. be transport aircraft to S.E.A. + 450 Air 75 Army to reinforce C’wealth Brigade.  Another 1400 might be needed later.
	We cd. then mount Buckram, which is our maximum S.E.A.T.O. commitment.

	Prs. one week before Br. troops cd. move from Malaya.  Prs. quicker if they cd. go from Butterworth.

	We may be asked for less than the full Buckram.

	A. &amp; N.Z. support wd. be requd. if C’wealth Brigade were to be used as a whole.

D.S.	Main change is tht it now appears U.S. wd. prefer intervention by S.E.A.T.O. not by U.S. alone.  I always took that view.  This wd. be better than U.S. or Anglo-American intervention.

E.H.	Clear on Saty. tht. P.M. shd. accept invitn. to discuss with M.K
	On substance, advice we gave is in Track 7.  (Since then we have heard tht. Nehru has strongly supported our proposals for political settlement).  Priorities : i) pol settlement  ii) para.military effort  iii) intervention under S.E.A.T.O. aegis, but mainly by U.S.

R.A.B.	Reinforced by {Track 12 Pers. 80} from H. – who veered twds. S.E.A.T.O. operation.

D.S.	My talk with Menon shd. not be taken as offering any encouragement.
	Next in time scale wd. be C’wealth Brigade, or elements of it.

H.W.	If posn worsened quickly, only rapid intervention cd by be U.S. next in time scale ......

R.A.B.	Easier qua Parlo, to present this as a commitment arising from Manila Treaty.

S.L.I.	Wd. have bn. better if U.S. had bn. willing to intervene alone.  That wd. have bn. best hope of preventing it spreading.
	But clear now tht. U.S. won’t do it – or tht. we cd. restrain S.E.A.T.O. from becoming involved in it.  Then, we must stand by our obligns.  (That at least is better than Anglo-U.S. intervention).
	Must support P.M. – tho’ I think it’s wrong.

K.	Must support P.M.’s lines.  In Bangkok mtg. speeches already made by H., Menzies and Rusk – all taking strong line.
	Worried by Track 20.
	Action by S.E.A.T.O. puts us in better U.N posn.  But depends on being asked to help by Laos – &amp; Track 20 is worrying.

P.T.	Sitn. is graver than we had thought last time.
	R. will play this long – sitn. going their way.
	This mil. plan may have to be put into opn. before any reply recd.
	We have to support this.  But wish we cd. know what mil. plan is.
	What is meant by words in para.3 of Track 5.

H.W.	See para.5 of Track 4.  Evidently a v. limited operation is in view.  Prob. a perimeter around Vientiane.

R.A.B.	Suggest we send tel to H., repeating to R.M.
	We rely on pol. approach – hope for R. reply.
	Agree some mil. planning m’while.x.  Can’t see what plan is in detail because tel. corrupt : but assume it is on lines of Track 6.  Assume no action w’out further decn. by Govts. – not by commanders in area. x. by U.K./U.S. mil. only.

	Support increased para. mil. action m’while.

D.S.	Shd. press U.S. to let us know what their ultimate intentions are – little certainty tht. it will remain limited.
	Stress need for invitn. from Laos Govt.
	How do we handle U.N., before action taken.

E.H.	Laos is still on agenda of S. Council – still before them.
	Action under Art.52 or Art.4 of Manila, only oblign. to U.N. is to inform them.  If we do other, we are in danger of frustration because S. Council is seized of situation : then wd. be resolns. calling on us to desist etc.

S.L.I.	Shd. we not get Thailand to ask us to go in there – preventative action?  

D.S.  	Yes : in advance of any move into Laos.
	Might not then be necessary to go into Laos.

J.H.	Add – don’t place any reliance on Menon’s conversation.

R.A.B.	Stress tht. no decn. to act can be taken w’out further decn. by Govts.
