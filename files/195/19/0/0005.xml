C.C. 35(60).								20th  June 1960


		1.	Nuclear Weapons : Sky-Bolt

H.W.	U.S. Air Force are v. keen to prolong life of their S.A.C. – by i) stand-off bomb ii) b. missile.  All constituent parts of Sky-bolt have flown in other weapons : belief that it will succeed.  They want us in, on this.  Reservations a) can’t be certain yet that it will work.  b) U.S. won’t make it for us if they don’t make it for themselves. 
	I am planning to use this in Vulcans only – not Victors.

P.M.	Memo. of understanding concluded.  Now we shd. carry it a further stage fwd. – by work of technical mission to U.S.  We must be associated closely with development, to ensure that weapon is suitable for use with our bombers.

D.S.	No alternative.

H.A.	Will bomber force itself be sufficiently invulnerable by ’65.  If so, &amp; if Sky-bolt works, it wd. be cheaper alternative.  Tho’ by no means cheap.  Tho’ we can’t be sure we shall be able to meet oversea cost when the time comes.

D.S.	Main purpose: prolong life of existing bombers.  If V.C. 10’s are needed, cost of that wd. vitiate this argument.

G.W.	Believe we may be able to prolong Vulcans for longer than we previously thought.  Study suggests we shan’t be able to buy V.C. 10’s w’in time-scale.  Vulcan shd last until well into 1970’s.

		Memo. approved.


2.	Polaris : Base in U.K.

P.M.	Promised at C. David to consider this favourably – no commitment on place.  
	Urgent because U.S. Adminn. want agreement before Election.  
	U.S. theory of diversification of deterrent – based on land, sea &amp; air.

H.W.	Pentagon believe tht. West can only m’tain deterrent’s credibility if variety of means of delivery is increased.  
	Details of Polaris submarine : method of operation.  
	If based on W. Scotland, they save 30% of force.  
	They want U.K. in on this enterprise.  They also want this base : rather than one in Germany.  
	They want to sail their depot ship here this summer.

D.S.	How many bases this side of Atlantic?  

H.W.	Only this one, for time being.

P.M.	Vital to credibility – for this could fire “second”.  
	Depot ship: 85° north. Return flight from Prestwick.  This makes Gareloch attractive to them.  They like it too, because near to facilities &amp; amenities of Glasgow.  Awkward for us – v. near to v. large centre of populn.  
	Advantages : even for us, a hedge v. failure of Sky-bolt.  And sea-borne deterrent will appeal to B. public opinion.  
	Do we do it?  What do we get for it?  Is Gareloch a good site?  If we do go into this, get conditions enabling us to buy ourselves in?  
	On location, suggest a commission to investigate.

C.	U.S. suggested Gareloch because they cd. then start this year, without waiting to build schools etc.,

H.W.	Must ensure that R. will be able to produce these weapons in a short time.

S.L1.	This is real deterrent.  Important to get an option to join in it.  New mil. developt. of gt. potential danger.  We ought to get in on its organisation etc.,

D.S.	As Allies we can’t refuse this gt. advantage to U.S.  
	Make up our minds we can’t afford to have both this &amp; Sky bolt.  If we had 3 Polaris &amp; Sky bolt &amp; V.C. 10’s, cost wd. be no less than Blue Streak.  We shd. get the option &amp; put ourselves in posn. to switch on deterrent.

H.A.	In principle, I’m in favour of giving the facility.  I also agree we shd. get an option – but avoid commitment.

H.W.	If we build ourselves, it wd. come in after Sky bolt.  Delay option until we know wtr Sky bolt works.

E.M.	V. helpful if they wd. build one here.  

H.W.	Hull only : cdn’t build the rest here.

H.	Dangerous feature is slender control.  We shd. be in on it.

P.M.	We can’t defend this on Attlee/Truman basis for bombers.

D.S.	We cd. get assurance they wdn’t fire, w’out our agreement, w’in large area from U.K. – e.g. 100 miles.

P.M.	We shd. try to have an officer with Saclant.

H.W.	They want that.

R.A.B	Public opinion is getting restive about U.S. nuclear forces in U.K.  Annoyance at U.S. alert at time of Summit Mtg.  
	But U.K./U.S. must work together.  We can’t stand alone.  But this brings it to a head.  We shall have to build some political structures to off-set irritations caused by presence of U.S. troops etc., here.  Risk of increased anti-U.S. feeling.

D.S.	Local popn. will be less annoyed by this than by S.A.C.

C.	The longer you delay option, longer you p’pone training crews etc.,

P.M.	We cd. do that in advance of deciding to buy or build ourselves.

H.	Climate for integrating with U.S. is better since Paris.  But danger on this is tenuous control : people will be nervous of this.

S.L1.	Avoid use of word “base”.

J.M.	Cd. we move back to combined C.O.S?

P.M.	No : there are French.

P.M.	Norstandt’s notion that land-based mobile Polaris missiles shd. be allotted to N.A.T.O – purchased on key-of-cupboard basis.  Our C.O.S. are opposed on mil. grounds, as putting a strategic weapon in hands of SACEUR.  French don’t want it because no contribn. to their wish to have independent nuclear capacity.  Many don’t want G. to have them.  
	But Spaak favours it.  Propose tht., if we have option to come in on Polaris submarine, we shd contract out of European M.R.B.M.  We cd. have 3 P. subs. &amp; say it was our contn. to this European plan. – wd. involve putting them under SACLANT.

H.W.	Gates wd. think this a sensible contn. from U.K., with its naval traditions.

D.S.	Do utmost to avoid NATO adopting it.  But, if they buy it, cdn’t we get our P. subs. on same basis as bombers – e.g. under SACLANT only for bombing p’mme.  We cd. throw our Thors into M.R.M.B. European plan.

P.M.	Dangerous tendency to rely increasingly on nuclear weapons.  Called tactical because short range : but capable of doing as much damage as a strategic weapon.

D.S.	SACEUR already has, in r.a.f., force capable of dropping nuclear bombs on same targets.

P.M.	Invite views on location of tender.  They are keen on Gareloch.  Alternative = F. William.  5 hours by road to Prestwick.  Or 67 miles to airport at Inverness.

J.M.	Disadvantage of Gareloch mainly is of hostile demonstrations etc.,

P.M.	Admy. authorised to survey sites on the spot.  Loch Linnhe.
