  <content>C.C.42(60)							14th July 1960


		1.	Parliament.					[Enter M.R.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.


		2.	Foreign Affairs.

		a)	Congo.

S.Ll.	Soviet protest – breach of international law.  Complaint v. us was mainly concerned with Fedn. troops.

	Local sitn. : B. control Eur. quarter and airfield at Leopoldville.  B. subjects are w’in Embassy Zone.  Katanga quiet.  Stanleyville : 12 B. families and no Belgian troops.  Govr. Kenya, authorised last night to take emergency action to evacuate them – incldg. use of mil. aircraft if necessary, with small no. of troops to safeguard the aircraft.  (Authority given by P.M., with S.Ll. and I.M.  Cabinet * endorsed decision.)

	Katanga has declared independence.  Belgians are equivocal on ques. wthr. they will recognise this.  Belgian troops in whole territory are being increased from 4.000 to 8.000.

	U.N. Security Council have passed resoln. calling on Belgium to w’draw troops and ordering Sec. Genl. to organise mil. assistance temporarily (3 abstentions : U.K., France, China) until l. authorities are in control.

	Ghana.  Troops ready to go.  U.K. aircraft required.  Congolese Govt. have bn. asking them direct.  Nkrumah hopes to be able to act under U.N. auspices.

	Fund for relief of distress in Congo is being raised.  Shd. we contribute?

H.	Can Belgians put their troops under U.N. Command?

S.Ll.	Unlikely that U.N. would accept them.

P.M.	V. diff. situation.  Rhodesia alarmed : Ghana seeking to intervene : a conflict between the 2 is possible.  N. asking for loan of our
	i)	aircraft for his troops.  Bad for them to intervene as Ghanaian.
		But ok if done under U.N. auspices.  Can we arrange that?
	ii) 	 Is it our duty and interest to accept seccession of Katanga?  Might be in 		our interest.  But a U.N. Force will progressively re-establish authy. of 		central Govt. – which is likely to be more extreme, and even 			Communist controlled.

		On (i) general agreement we shd. act under U.N. auspices.

S.Ll.	U.N. is better, in our interest, than B. attempt to re-conquer or chaos which R. and China would exploit.

	Further discussion – not noted.
							[Exit S.Ll. and H.


		3.	Kenya.

I.M.	Lancaster Ho. agreement now has almost universal support in K.
	But anxiety remains about land tenure.  I suggest – i) re-affirmn. of non racial policy in respect of land.  ii) we shd. deal with this in U.K. not by local legn.  (iii) Cab. Cttee. to evolve solution on security of tenure, under K’s chairmanship.  (iv) Possibly a conference here on land titles.

R.A.B.	Date of announcement in Annex B?  

I.M.	20-23 July – here and in Kenya.

H.A.	No objn. of substance.  Alarmed by para.2 of draft statement – wd. raise false hopes.  The possible schemes wd. be v. costly to Exchequer - £100 m. or over – which wd. be beyond our means.

I.M.	I have said, in H/C.  Kenya, that compensation is out of question.
	Some other solution – tho’ it may cost something to Ty.

				Memo. approved.


		4.	Non-Industrial Employment : Shops. Offices etc.

R.A.B.	No legn. in coming session.  Propose comprehensive legn. in session after next so that we can initiate comprehensive consultations.
	This will leave private Bill inoperative – no regulations wd. be made under it.

	T.U.C. wd. prefer this method.

H.A.	Administrative cost of enforcement – prob. £¼ m.
	Tory Party wdn’t accept l.a. enforcement because of excessive zeal of Socialist l.a.’s.

H.B.	This is an open ques. still : don’t agree with R.A.B.

E.M.	Crippling burden on rlways.

M.	Also on industry.  What is contemplated?

H.A.	Total cost might be £130 m.

D.E.	At a time when we shd. be concentrated on productive investment.

E.H.	As under Factories Act we shd. have ample discretion to delay compliance.

D.E.	My minor works p’mme is subject to Ty. control.

R.A.B.	Ready to submit this equally to Investment P’mme Control.

H.A.	Cd. only control it by mitigating enforcement.

P.M.	We can’t escape fact that Marsh Bill will come into law.  Can we ease posn. by making our own Bill, more comprehensive, but less onerous and more flexible.

H.A.	Still feel that this is not an urgent priority.


		5.	Artificial Insemination.

		Approved.


		6.	Supersonic Airliner.

H.A.	Doubts about any project of this kind.  Particular doubt about this slower alternative.

D.S.	Shd. we not at least find out wthr. U.S. are interested.

H.W.	U.S. are building 2 steel aircraft around Mach 3 out of defence votes.
	May be for an airliner.

H.A.	I wd. sooner keep r. and d. going on 2.7 as well as 2.2.

P.M.	Dpts. must consider wthr. we wd. be more likely to get assocn. with other countries if we continued studies up to Mach 3.

	H.A. to consult on this with interested Ministers.

D.S.	I want to choose betwn. 2 aircraft co. groups : &amp; get chosen one to talk to U.S.  To save money and secure negotns.

			Cabinet to resume discussion later.
