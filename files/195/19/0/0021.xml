  <content>C.C.59(60)							25th November 1960


		1.	Foreign Affairs.		[Enter Att.G., E.Boyle., M.R.

		(a)	Congo.

H.	Kasaumbu seated in U.N.  K. has returned to Ghana – where troops of various nations are at odds.  Next step : to get U.N. authies. on spot to co-operate with K. &amp; his repves.

		(b)	Laos.

	Situatn. is getting worse.  Civil War.  Communists likely to make ground over this.

		(c)	Italy.

	Talks satisfactory.  Sympathetic to our desire to draw closer to Six.
	If we cd. find way over horticulture, they wd. support us in approach.

P.M.	They are stronger, economy being more industrialised &amp; exports being now more industrialised products than were before.  They are more confident.  Such influence as they have will be helpful to us.
	Fanfarin has more courage than Sequi.

		(d)	United Nations.

H.	Resolution on Colonialism.  O.G. wants us to seek amendments wh. wd. enable us to vote in favour.  Doubtful if this is right – any resoln. likely to include dates for independence.

I.M.	Agree : better have extreme resolution which we can vote against – or abstain.

H.	Diffy. is tht. our friends (U.S. and Austr.) are urging us to take O.G.’s line.

	
2.	Parliament.

R.A.B.	Business for next week.
	Lord Stansgate – succession.  He has put in a memorial.  In view of public interest, I think that we had better refer it to some Select Cttee.  We favour reference to Cttee. of Privileges.  Att.G. is a member.
	(His petition is debatable : but opinion wd. be hostile if we sought to kill this summarily in initial debate.)

Att.G.	Petition is addressed to contention tht. he is still Member of H/C.
	This and his supporting arguments can be summarily dismissed.
	If this is referred to Cttee. it wd. be a waste of time : for H/C.
	Cttee. can’t consider wthr. an individual is a member of H/Lords.
	Improper for them to do so.  Tho’ I, in course of my duty, cd. properly advise H/C. that he is not a member of H/C.

K.	Agree there is nothing in his case, under existing law.
	Agree also that it is for H/L. to say wthr. a man is a Peer.

R.A.B.	H/L. point cd. be met by statement in the Report that this is a matter for H/Lords.

P.M.	Ques. is wholly one of tactics.

R.A.B.	Debate is inevitable.  On basis of the petition only, bound to be unsatisfactory.  On basis of report by Sel. Cttee. cd. be satisfactory.

Hail.	Reference to a Cttee. of H/L. would not in itself breach H/L. privilege.
	No substantive met by H/C. until House Votes on report of a Cttee.  And privilege of H/L. can be preserved then.

Att.G.	No : for Cttee. will have to consider validity of his document of renunciation.

Hail.	Cttee. can (and shd.) refrain from pronouncing on that.

P.M.	We must prevent this developing into great argument on ques. wthr. law shd. be changed.

M.R.	Opinion in Party is shaky on this.

		Agreed – as proposed by R.A.B.

	
3.	General Grant in Scotland.

J.M.	We want a margin ot £¼m in each year – over figures in memo.

E.B.	Prefer to hold to figures in memo.  Scotland is doing v. well.

J.M.	I will do my best to meet Ty. wishes.

		Approved – subject to considn. of point made.

	
4.	Egypt : Financial Settlement.

E.H.	Estimate of total claim is £100 m. – not more.
	Leave £7½ m. : expect to recover £1 m. of that.
	Interim (second) payment ought to be made now – claimants shd. have the money we are getting in.  We paid low claims at high level on first out payment : we ought now to give some benefit to higher claimants.

	On my proposals we shall have only £6 m. left for final payment.  We shall be pressed to make Ty. contn. then.  We have always said this was not excluded and S.Ll. is sympathetic.
	My plan wd. ratify all save small claimants.  Wd. cost only £1 m. to pay them out.  But that wd. encourage larger claimants to believe they wd. get more fr. Ty. than is likely to be available.
	Commission, in assessing claims, has taken a/c of loss of profits, employment etc.  S.Ll. wonders wthr. this cd. be excluded in future.
	Doubt if we cd. change basis of assessment in mid stream.
	S.Ll. wd. also like to discriminate, in final payment, between Egyptians and sequestrated.  Doubt if we cd. do that.  Pressure will be to pay more, not less, to sequestrated.

E.B.	No comment.  Obliged for F.O. considn. of Ty. suggns., but don’t press them.

K.	Can L.O.’s look at the draft order.  It will not go to Legn. Cttee.

H.	i)	Cd. we not get small claimants right out of the way – in the hope that 		larger claimants wd. ignore their posn. in final settlement.
	ii)	Need we recover all the loans.  

E.H.		We can consider that in individual cases.  

P.M. 		Avoid any general statement on that until final settlement.

E.B.	S.Ll. agrees : get this second instalment done : reserve other ques. for the final settlement.

	
5.	Channel Tunnel.

E.M.	Para.3(c) is important.  E.P.C. rejected this.
	How approach French?  How deal with pressure group here?
	We must not arouse expectations.

R.A.B.	I’m against Tunnel : don’t encourage it.

H.B.	Must have a low priority.

H.W.	Immense expenditure – for v. small benefit.  Bury it.

P.M.	Para.8.  French will exploit reference to “difficulties” &amp; say we are smothering it.  Can’t we play it slow and quiet.

E.H.	Yes : thro’ Embassy in Paris.

P.M.	Say : we’re ready to discuss when they are.

E.M.	Pretty sure French Govt. don’t favour it.

 
		6.	Commonwealth Immigrants.

R.A.B.	Over 11.000 now unemployed.  And 43.000 immigrants this year up to date.  Problem has worsened since memo. written serious considn. needed of possibility of action next year.

	Hope therefore tht. Cttee. can be re-constituted.

I.M.	i)	Enlarge title of Cttee. – not Colonial only.
	ii)	Adminve. action won’t do much more.  We shall have to face ques.
	wthr. we legislate or not.

Hail.	If we do act, try to do so where there is no panic about it.
	Act in a period of calm.

J.H.	May be rate of 100.000 a year soon.  Quality is dropping.  Placing is more difficult.

E.M.	B.T.C. are positively recruiting them – in W. Indies.

Alp.	Indians are w’drawing their restrictions on emigration to U.K.
	Also outflow of Asians from E. Africa.

I.M.	“Quiet time” : there will never be one for the other countries.

	Agreed  : Re-constitue Cttee. as “Commonwealth Migrants Cttee.”

	
7.	Covent Garden Market.

C.S.	Support memo.

E.M.	W’draw my objections.

				Approved.
