  <content>C.C. 36(60).								21st June 1960.


		1.	Foreign Affairs. 				[Enter M.R.

(a)	Cyprus.

S.L1.	Agreement reached on a formula in session – with T.&amp; G. Govts, now to be put to Mak. Govts. are also ready to put pressure on M. to conclude agreement.  Defer statement in H/C. pro. tem.

P.M.	If Mak. won’t settle now, we break off &amp; summon conference of Govts.

(b)	Nuclear Tests.

S.L1.	R. have insisted tht. they shd. examine device used in any U.S. test explosion.  And have now reverted to discussion of other points.

P.M.	May be that R. don’t want to conclude agreement with this U.S. Adminn. 

(c)	European Co-operation.

S.L1.	Thursday’s mtg.  Tactics for mtg. on wtr we shd. join Euratom.  3 Benelux countries accused U.K. &amp; Fr. of being negative on whole ques of co-opn. in Europe : gave us a chance to reply to that &amp; make it clear that Six, not we, were hanging back.  Ad hoc mtg. of Ambassadors in London.  Agenda : how to discuss this ques : what about possibility of doing this in isolation : our military obligns.  Show constructive spirit in exposing realities of the ques.

R.M.	Examine this in context of satisfactory general settlement.

S.L1.	Mil. diffies. are being raised by U.S.

H.A.	Hope diffies., tho’ real, will be brought out by others.

S.Ll.	Signs of some change of thought w’in Six – revulsion v. tight political Federation.

P.M.	Ambassadors must have some good technical advisers.


2.	Economic Situation

H.A.	Views given on 25/4.  Little change since – if anything sitn is tighter.  External balance.  I assumed £200m. drop in monetary position: since then imports in ac. forecast &amp; exports have levelled off.  Sterling has held – just above par – but prospects of continuing loss on reserves.  Clear therefore some remedy shd. be applied.  i) Stimulus to exports – Ty. &amp; D/T are making study.  ii) Reduce rate of expansion internally, to reduce demand for imports and make room for more exports.  Hope this won’t develop to crisis – as in ’57.  But steady pull over 2 yrs.  Internal sitn.  Unemployment v. small.  Signs of competn. For labour.  e.g. Ldn. busmen: £1 increase needed to keep them.  c/living has remained steady – 2 yrs 1 month now.  Over next 6 months likely to rise 1 or 2 points.  Bank advances.  Now want a decrease over 6 mos, not merely a check in growth.  Private investment of all kinds wd. otherwise increase.  Public expenditure on investment is showg. signs of levelling off.  H.P. controls.  Can’t yet gauge effect of April’s modest changes.  No reason to fear that Hoovers is typical reaction.  On picture as a whole, no doubt tht. some restriction is needed – for both external &amp; internal situations.  Limited no. of weapons: don’t use all at once: on other hand effects take time to mature.  On balance I favour pretty early action, in course of the summit: to give us respite in wh. we work out methods for the long-pull to remedy our b/p.

M.	Don’t think we have had time to gauge effect of actions taken.  Also doubt tht. internal remedies will improve external situation.  Don’t rush.

H.B.	Lack of local remedies.  For pressure on economy is local – e.g. Ldn., B’ham.  General remedies, were in h.p., bite unhappily on Merthyr or Scotland, when no pressure.

H.A.	Distinction applies only to man-power.  Otherwise over-spending is general - &amp; applies mainly to goods made in Ldn &amp; B’ham.

H.B.	Don’t accept that view.  Much of spending goes into local service indies.  But academic – because no local remedies.  More generally, don’t use all weapons now.  Keep some in reserve: &amp; esp. bank rate.

J.M.	Can’t we find means of checking consumption without cutting into money available for investment or production.  Need for continuing prodn . expenditure in Scotland.

H.A.	Even that doesn’t work.  Even on bldg in Scotland, much of the expenditure is made elsewhere – for materials of various kinds.  Even if we cd. apply discrimination, we shd. have to balance encouragement in our area by reduction elsewhere.

D.S.	Stimulation of exports – consider loans, guarantees etc., even if not immediately remunerative.  Can’t we be more flexible in this?

H.A.	It is pretty flexible now.  And gt. need is for exports which are paid for – only then will improve b/p position.

D.E.	Agree with H.A.  Any discriminatory policies must now be directed, not to unemplt., but to exports.  Remedies.  Unhappy about bank-rate.  Affects movement of f. funds but no appreciable effect on amounts of money lent internally.  Merely puts up its cost.  You must restrict amount Banks have to lend, rather than rely on its price.  Don’t raise b.rate therefore unless this is necessary in order to keep f. money here – to avoid pure exchange crisis.  If special deposit scheme cd. be bolstered up by similar restn. on other institutions (e.g. investment houses) it wd. be even better.  Don’t believe in reservg. some weapons until later – may be useless then.

I.M.	On Scotland etc., I accept H.A.’s conclusion.  On main issue I side with Mill’s.  Risk of too much coddling of economy by Govt.  Cdn’t we let things ride for a time - &amp; say we so intended.

H. 		How soon cd. we act on h.p.?

H.A.	Cdn’t make further increase now – only after 2 months.  Must wait at least until we can gauge effects of that action.  Limitation also of this weapon – for applies mainly to a v. few industries.

R.A.B.	Essential to tighten credit base – otherwise we shall get into real trouble.

H.A.	Fall in gilt-edge is welcome: for we shan’t get our economy straight unless we get higher interest rate.

R.A.B	Special deposits.  First step was not enough: we shd. act on that.  B. rates I wdn’t move unless necessary for exchange situation.  Legn. contemplated to extend sp. deposits plan to other institutions.  Cd. this be advanced?  

H.A.	Haven’t yet found method.  Hope we shall, &amp; then be able to legislate next session.  H.p. – no more at present.  H.M.’s minute of 1957 on credit base.  Doubtful about extending export credits – start a race which foreigners are bound to win.

H.A.	Not enough to control volume of credit: must also control velocity of its circulation.  And b.rate does help with that.

D.E.	Bank credit as propn of deposits.  Pre-war averaged 45%.  Now is nearly 47%.  Increase in total deposits only 10%: in credit nearly 30%: money obtained therefore, not from fresh deposits, but by sale of gilt-edged.  Banks therefore will be more sensitive to Ty. Control now that pre-war patterns has bn re-established.

H.A.	Action by us will certainly provoke ques: what are you going to do about Govt. expenditure?  We can’t say anything on this at present: review about to begin.  We cd., however, indicate that we shan’t allow it to rise above present level.  Any increase therefore wd. have to be offset by cuts.

K.	i) Two months’ ago long Ty. memo. forecasting developments.  Have there bn. any changes from that?
	ii) Can you increase exports w’out increasing investment?

H.A.	Have always forecast need for series of anti-inflationary measures throughout this year.  Said that at Xmas: again on Budget (when I made it plain tht. on economic grounds I ought to do more than I cd. on political gnds.)  Two months ago: v. mild measures which I put fwd. as a first, not a complete, measure.  At each stage I have contemplated need for further action later.  Events have in main matched f’cast.  But emplt. has bn. a little tighter: exports have levelled off: consumption v. slightly higher: wage increases threaten, unless mood is changed, and this will endanger exports.

E.H.	Normal seasonal fall in unemplt. plus a little more.  Real trouble is lack of skilled men in certain occupns.  Speed of economy.  Shan’t get training schemes unless T.U.’s see that economy is running fast enough to absorb them.  Study Germany which runs economy w’out inflation at 5% unemployment.  Let us be clear what problem is.  If its not money, we ought to find means of dealing with it.  It’s not confidence in £.  It’s apparently monetary posn: &amp; that means exports.  Is our target of £400m. attainable.  If not, we must adjust oversea spending loans etc.  Can’t have our oversea policy unaltered if we can’t realise the £400m.

H.A.	Agree.  Present view: not unattainable if exports can rise to fill the openings that exist.

P.M.	Fundamental ques.  If import/export posn is unbalanced, run the economy faster.  Others say: pull of home market is too great – therefore restrict.  Shd. we go beyond modest measures already taken?  From angle of restricting home demand, strong case for increasing level of special deposits plan.  True, it wd. be logical to extend this to investment (h.p.) cos.; but practical effect is marginal.  Fair enough to act on Banks alone, esp. if we can contemplate extendg. scope by legn.  Anyhow, Banks have done v. well out of extendg. credit.  Banks do not sufficiently regard themselves as trustees – to preserve capitalist system – operate too much on sole basis of profit motive: industry has a more up-to-date view of its public duty.  We must educate or even control them – thro’ stronger influence at B/England.  I therefore prefer extended use of sp. deposit plan.  We must operate thro’ Banks: if appeals are ineffective, as shown, we must operate by control.  This will operate only on volume of house demand.  This therefore is method to use if that is what is needed.  Bank rate – operates more on exchange situation.  If business is good and your assets are strong, price of money doesn’t make much difference.  Nor much influence on private borrower.  Certainly its classical value is for exchange crisis – to attract f. money, even if it’s not: or to discourage foreigners borrowing here.

H.A.	Dissented.  Value of b.rate 50% psychological effect on home market.

P.M.	Suppose we do end at £200m. down on monetary position – will that shake confidence in £?  Seems clear enough we shd. increase sp. deposits notn.  If D.E.’s argument about their pre-war pattern is sound, small action on this wd. pos. be enough.  Bank-rate.  If, we use this now, will it avert sterling crisis?  (We ought to be increasing reserves in this time of the year.)  Or shall we be at risk of creating our own crisis?  For a second increase in autumn wd. be a crisis measure.  Political posn is strong.  But h/p crisis or inflation wd. damage us more than anything.  Excessive pessimism in judgement cd be more easily defended, politically, than optimism.  Final ques therefore is – shd. we use both weapons now.  Remember retrospective effect of b.rate – applies to people who have borrowed not merely discourages those who contemplate borrowing.

H.A.	It is for me to decide on timing of these measures – tho’ I have always believed in more consultn with colleagues than has bn. customary in the past; and I favour increased consultn.  May I have authority to say, at some time tho’ not linked – formula on public investment: intention to hold it at level of this year.


	3.	Iron and Steel Industry			[Enter R.W.

H.A.	As in memo.  G. Elec has now told me i) as private investor we wdn’t sell equity until expansion p’mme comes to fruition in 2-3 years.  ii) don’t sell in a year; for net profit will be down next year and rise in ’63. : sell now or not for 2 years.  iii) if it seems tht. we aren’t going to sell at all, this will make it diff. for him to expand executive staff.  We shall, however, be criticised for selling prior charges at 15% loss.  Tho’ Ty, say tht., so long as we have to borrow, there’s nil in this point.  Elec. advice doesn’t warrant changing plan put fwd. in this memo.

M.	I agree.  I still support the alternative plan in memo.  Tho’ this operation may involve a loss.  ISRA’s operations as a whole will still show a profit.

R.W.	I agree.  Politically, any other course wd. be difficult.  This can be defended – on basis of waiting until R.T.B’s expansion is complete.

E.H.	This means R.T.B can’t be de-nationalised in this Parlt.

H.A.	We cd. sell in ’63 – on basis of promising prospectus.

E.H.	But by then the industry will again be under threat of re-nationaln

M.	I believe (unlike Ely) that we cd. sell next year.

R.A.B.	Postponement will not be agreeable to supporters.  Para. 12., last line: this won’t go v. well.

D.E.	With restns in view (Item 2) we can’t hope to sell much steel stock this year.  Surely we ought to give priority to new money for R.T.B.

H.A.   X/	That will be our priority in this package.

R.M.	Strong arguments v. selling R.T.B. now.  But believe, with E.H. that this will continue to be so for more than a year.

P.M.    X/	Consider making a proportion of the debentures for R.T.B. convertible.

				Memo – approved subject to X/ and X/
