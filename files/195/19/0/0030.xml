  <content>C.C.5(61)							7th February 1961


		1.	Foreign Affairs.				[Enter M.R.

H.	a)	Iceland.  Time is now ripe for message from P.M.
	b)	Egypt.  Exchange of Ambassadors arranged : Zarb released.
	c)	Laos.  Looks as tho R. won’t agree to Commn. save on condn.
	of a conference.  But U.S. more favourable to that.
	d)	Congo.  Progress with round-table conference.  K.’s efforts
	in some areas are attracting support tho’ Tsmuti’s condns. are put v. high.  But B. arms are coming in.  And U.N. idea of neutralising Congo Army will cause trouble.
	Not good : but no worse.

	
2.	Department of Technical Co-operation.	[Enter Alport.

P.M.	Memo circulated.

	Points i) Supply of teachers.  Educn. Dpts. will retain existing functions : their relns. will be with new Dpt. via oversea Dpts.

H.	New Dpt. wd. not take over work of Br. Council.

P.M.	Presentation – Head’s telegram.

C.M.A.	In nearby independent countries gt. sensitiveness to continuing “Colonial” rule.  Cd. reduce this by operating in 2 phases.
	P’poning until later transfer of responsibility for O.C.S.  Argument against – Dpt. wd. not be viable.  Nigerian refusal to adopt new O.C.S. plan is a warning we shd. heed.

P.M.	Better perhaps to p’pone announcement until after P.M.M.

I.M.	Awkward to appear to consult them.

H.	Cd. tell them w’out appearing to consult.

C.M.A.	No objn. from old Doms.  Canada, eg. has already gone further.
	Prob. no gt. objn. from Asian countries.
	Even Nigeria – P.M. wd. prob. favour it, if explained in advance.

M.	No further progress w’out such a Dpt.

I.M.	Incln. of O.C.S. wd. help to avoid disappointment at no Commonwealth Service : esp. in Colonial Service.

P.M.	We can consider taking it in 2 bites.

		Agreed  : 	p’pone announcement until after P.M.M.
				re-consider O.C.S. point ? 2 stages.
	
3.	Federation of Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland.

P.M.	Federal review adjourned until constitutional reform in N. &amp; S. Rhodesia has bn. carried a further stage.

	In S. Rhodesia some progress seems to have bn. made.

I.M.	In N. Rhodesia – playing it slow.  Can’t keep it going for more than 48 hours.  Don’t think we cd. merely adjourn it – w’out risk of disorder.  U.F.P. boycott was mistake – shows Party to be dominated by Salisbury &amp; also that they are purely European party.

	Hope to be able to put issues to Cab. on Friday.

	
4.	Newspaper Mergers.

P.M.	Made it plain in H/C. tht. we wd. not intervene in current negotns.
	Remaining ques. : is there need for longer-term enquiry into economics of newspaper &amp; magazine industry.

	Argument for – i) public anxiety ii) risk of another merger or suppression before long.  iii) expose facts, to help industry to put their house in order.

	Against – i) appear to be acting under pressure ii) might spread to large scale organisation of business etc. generally.  iii) recommns. may be embarrassing.

	Possible terms of reference.
	Type of enquiry.  Need to call for persons &amp; papers.  Therefore R. Commn. but with small membership eg. five.  [Tho’ powers of R. commn. may be in doubt, it is harder for people to refuse to disclose facts to R. Commn. than to Dpt. Cttee.]

K.	On balance I favour this.  There is a threat to democracy here.

S.L.I	Agree.  Restrictive practices in printing – cdn’t have legn. without preliminary enquiry.

R.M.	Distinguish newspp. from industry generally.

I.M.	In favour.

J.H.	Favour light being thrown into v. practices of printing trade.

P.M.G.	Overlap with what we have asked Pilkington Commn. to do.

P.M.	Shall have to write to him.  W’draw request for interim report, esp. on 2nd point.  W’draw your letter &amp; change it.

R.A.B.	Content.  Esp. in view of threat to Glasgow Herald.

P.T.	In fact, we shall be in baulk while R.C. is sitting and this will provoke Thompson to get ahead.

P.M.	Might send for them after R.C. appointed.  Better posture.

		Agreed.  Announce Thursday.
							[Exit P.M.


		5.	Facilities in U.K. for German Forces.

H.W.	No diffy. about storage or m’tenance facilities.  But mght. be pol. trouble over training facilities for G. tanks.  Hope it can be restricted to cadres. of tanks &amp; men.  No room in G. because we &amp; U.S. are using it all.  Might get £5-10 m. out of it all.

P.M.	Request is for up to 10 Armd. Regts. p.a.

H.W.	They only want range firing – not manoeuvres.
	Might help us to sell them tanks, eventually.

C.S.	They don’t need to come here for that only.

H.W.	We don’t know what they want yet.
	Part of N.A.T.O. interdependence.

P.M.	But the obgn. will be sentimental.  We must be ready : to defend it as a good thing on the philosophy of integration.

C.S.    x/.	Is done in France – and has gone v. well.

		Get details of proposal re tanks &amp; let Cab. see it again.
		F.O. to get report on x/.

	
6.	Sunday Observance.

R.A.B.	Pity not to do this as well as my other reforms.
	Need not involve legn. this session.

K.	Support this : in general interest of bringing law up to date.

Hail.	On balance we have got pol. credit for tackling social reform – betting etc. licensing.

E.H.	Sunday trading – if included in enquiry wd. preclude shops legn. While Commn. sitting.

P.M.	There will be 2 views: strongly held.

P.T.	Why not have a memo. showing the points for decision.
	Do it privately through H.O.
P.M.	Can we have a memo. on the law as it stands – and what are the areas for possible action.		Agreed.


		7.	Parliament : Expenses of Members.

S.L.I	Oppn. have now said they wd. like it – claim rail fare for journeys made by car between House, home and constituency.

		Agreed – introduce it.
