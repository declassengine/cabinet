		1.	Foreign Affairs.				[Enter M.R.

		a)	United Nations.

E.H.	89 in favour : 9 abstentions incldg. U.S., Australia., S.Africa.  Resoln. on Colonialism.

	Membership of Sec. Council – voting still dead locked.

	Congo : our motion carried, but vetoed by R.
	Conciliation Cttee. officers en route for Congo in private capacity.
	Stanleyville : troops (U.N.) are Ethiopian.  1 battn. bodyguard. 1 battn. Army possibly may take opposing sides.

	Ethiopia.

	Emperor on way back.  Sitn. confused : but coup likely to succeed, for loyal element in Army won’t concentrate v. Addis A. in time.
	Eritrea or Somalis may exploit situation.
	
	Revolt of younger generation.  U.A.R. not likely to be behind it.

	Algeria (U.N.)

	Our delegn. will vote v. resoln. in Cttee.  We shall try for a ⅓rd. blocking opposition in Assembly.

	Laos.

	King has recognised new Govt. but Assembly has not.  U.S. have not recognised it.  Pathet Lao surrounding royal capital.  Phouma under pressure to return and set up rival Govt. : more marked state of civil war.  New Govt. might then invite S.E.A.T.O. intervention, wh. wd. provoke increase R. and C. support for Pathet Lao.  H. is talking to Herter &amp; Couve in Paris.

	May be pressure for re-convening U.N. Commn.  Nehru may propose this.  Oppn may seek chance to debate in H/C.  India/Poland/Canada.  Cd. be re-constituted w’out reviving Geneva Conference : but our view has bn. tht. it won’t work w’out will and consent of Govt. in office.  U.S. don’t favour it.

	
2.	Europe : Finland.

R.M.	Oppn. developed v. Finland’s association.  Discn. adjourned.

4.	Coal : Sales in Ireland.		[Enter R. Wood., Alport.

R.W.	As in memo.
	Second proposal wd. prob. stop export of house coal to Republic.
	Not a trouble to N.C.B., who are short of it.

R.M.	Bad for export trade.  Won’t give N.I. any gt. satisfn. – for Eire will still get it cheaper from f. countries.

R.W.	Wd. only lose house coal market.  And resentment in N.I. wd. not be v. U.S.

R.A.B.    x./	It’s the 5/= wh. will phase N.I. most.  I wd. be content not to press for second proposal.

M.	Let N.C.B. try for a slightly higher price for Eire on new contracts.
	
Alp.	Tho’ not contrary to Trade Agreement, against its spirit – and Eire wd. have justifiable cause of complaint.

R.W.	N.C.B. think that any increase wd. lose the market.

		Agreed :	i) give the 5/=.
				ii) N.C.B. to get best price they can on new
				    contracts. (May).

		But defer announcement of ii) pro.tem.

	
5.	N. Ireland : Unemployment.

R.A.B.	Brookeboro’ asked me to receive his Cab. today.  Fobbed them off.
	But they are jumpy on unemploymt.
	No progress with Britannic : hope contract will be signed and nos. of aircraft increased, if possible.

	Will convene until Dipl. conference early after Xmas.
	Hope all Ministers will realise urgency.

E.M.	H. and Wolff are short of orders : the unemplt. rate will rise.

R.A.B.	Hope some Admy. orders may come along.


		6.	Commonwealth Youth Trust.		[Exit R.W.
								[Enter Perth.
Alp.	As in memo.

Ch. H.	Unlikely tht. interested people will contribute, if Govt. announce their hostel p’mme.  

Hail.	Support that point.

D.E.	Concert hostel plan with Univ. plans on location.  Also integrate with Br. – tho’ it will have to be 1:4 in favour of oversea students.

	Last para. will be taken as promise for Vol. Service Overseas.  I have no power to give them money.

P.	Memo. links the hostel p’mme too closely with Universities.
	Announcement is better on this point.
	Support suggn. of help for Vol. Services Overseas.

P.M.	There will be pressure for publn. of Templer.  Cd. we publish a summary.	Agreed : re-consider on this basis.

	
7.	Kenya : Land Tenure.

K.	Summarised report of Cttee.
	Essence of concln. is in last 2 sentences of draft announcemt.

9.	Hankey’s Memoirs.

P.M.	Have read this – urged him not to publish – he is determined to do so.
	V. old stuff.

	But wrong for a Secy. of Cabinet – bad taste.
	We shd. not be in good posn. if we took procdgs.

	If asked, shall say I don’t approve but shan’t act.
