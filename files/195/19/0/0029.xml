  <content>C.C.4(61)							2nd February 1961


		1.	Parliament.

	Business for next week.


		2.	Road Safety.					[Enter Att.G.

R.A.B.	Summarised memo.

Att.G.	a)	If you are to have “totting-up”  after 3 convictions, the offences to 			count shd. be offences of bad driving – other serious offences
	being dealt with separately on merits.  E.g. i) driving under age  ii) exceed speed limit  iii) ignore traffic signal – then on (iii) you get automatic disqualifn.  This is too much.  List shd. be narrowed to offences which involve bad driving : Cat. B. shd. be narrowed accordingly, but add power to extend it to new offences.  Half a dozen offences only.

R.A.B.	We preferred dangerous behaviour on roads vice bad driving, as the criterion.

H.W.	Support Att.G. – a) because diffy. of Cttee Stage  b) appearing to victimise motorists.

E.M.	Violent dissent from Att.G.  Risk is tht. measures are not as strong as public expects.  Want Cat. B. to stand as it is.

P.M.     x./	Do you start with short list of obvious offences &amp; leave others to be moved in : or start large and accept amendments to omit.

R.A.B.	More honest to prefer second course.  Reserve power to add by O.-in-C. wd. be v. controversial too.

S.Ll.	Cd. you give a discretion to courts not to improve automatic disqualn.

K.	List as it stands is nearer right than Att.G.

P.M.	Our discussion demonstrates how controversial this Bill will be in H/C.
	Real point is at x/.

K.	Remember tht. we accompany this with rationalisation of penalties.

P.M.	Defend on ground tht. cumalation record of such offences indicates tendency to dangerous behaviour on the roads which justifies disqualification.

C.S.	Bias in favour of leaving out the border line : to avoid appearance of victimising motorist.

P.M.	This points, on x/. to leaving H/C. with odium for adding the borderline cases.  Remember we can’t whip v. effectively on these ques.

H.W.	Remember tht. disqualfn. means, for some, loss of livelihood.

C.S.	Omit offence 9.

P.M.	Danger tht. you won’t get it thro’ H/C. if you start with complicated plan.

         y/	Better start it simple and threaten H/C. that they will lose the lot if they add too many.

		M/T, Ch. Hill. and Att.G. to scrutinise list on basis of y/.
		Leg. Cttee. to take the upshot – K. Keeping in touch with R.A.B. 	(quas H.A. Cttee).  List to be in schedule.

	b)	Death through dangerous driving.

Att.G.	Shd. be left to discretion of court wthr. to disqualify.  Shdn’t be heavier automatic penalty than dangerous driving.  If there is, juries will hesitate to convict.  Thing to punish is degree of culpability – not on basis of consequences.  I dissent from final sentence of para.4 – “Vindictive element”.

K.	i)	Origin of offence : law of negligence being in such a tangle.
		Solution was to make separate offence for causing death by d. 			driving.

	ii)	Believe taking life differentiates offence – both in theory and for 			practical reasons.

	iii)	If you don’t have this, its hard to justify automatic disqualfn. for 5-7 in 		Cat. A.

	(iv)	Analogous to w’drawing gun from man who has killed.

E.M.	Not a punishment – w’drawal of privilege of using dangerous vehicle.

R.A.B.	Common sense is in favour and tho’ principle of law (intent) is against.

		Agreed  -  as in report (view of majority).

	c)	Remission of Disqualification.

			Agreed -	Accept compromise : but confine power to 						courts with legally qualified chairman
 
 	d)	Drink and Driving.

Att.G.	Para.11(2) : attempt to load scales in favour of prosecution.  Only tolerable system we cd. devise : but encroaches on principles of English Law.  Solr. Genl. and I feel strong objns. to this.

Ch.H.	K. and H., on contrary, argued that w’out this there can’t be any effective introdn. of tests.  Practice in other countries is even more stringent.  But important to make some progress twds. more scientific test of drunkenness.

E.H.	Dislike this – adopted because we can’t enforce official testing.

K.	Only applied if refused for no good reason.

D.E.	Why not make acceptance of testing a condn. for obtaining a licence.

		Agreed  -  accept majority view.
