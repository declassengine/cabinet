  <content>C.C.33(61)							19th June 1961

	
1.	Federation of Rhodesia : Nyasaland.		[Enter M.R.

P.M.	Explained situation reached – as in brief.
	Africa Cttee. met this a.m. and agreed first task was to get R.W. to take our concessions seriously.

D.S.	Spoke on ‘phone to Robinson, who has spoken to Salisbury.  There has bn. mtg. of Cab. : R.W. has said he will examine middle roll scheme and has asked for details of it.  Wants, still, to come here on Wed., but will not announce it until tomorrow.

I.M.	Explained middle roll plan : for “national” seats.

P.M.	Upper roll now = 25.000 Europ : 3.000 Africans : 2.000 Asians.
	If  R.W. comes here, he will talk in general terms to Tories &amp; others.
	We must in that event let public know our proposals.

R.A.B.	Lobbying here is less serious than African re-actions to a violent public declaration &amp; election in Rhodesia.

D.S.	Must have some talk about middle roll, in order to keep R.W. in play.

							[Enter E.Hone.

E.Hone.	Explained disadvantage of middle roll plan.
	i) less certain because of equalising operatns. in advance of voting vice after. (W.P.)
	ii) If Africans are allowed to vote for national seats, will be said they are fit to vote on upper roll.
	iii) Abandoning minimum percentage is difficult for Moffatt.

P.T.	Better to send someone out to explain it all to R.W., rather than have him here.

I.M.	Moffatt is coming here now and Kaunda soon.  No point now in dropping it out beyond Thursday.

D.S.	But R.W. will nail his colours publicly to the mast when he comes here.

H.	If. R.W. breaks away, he will declare Fedn. independent and link up with S. Africa and Portugal.

I.M.	Doubt if S. Africa wd. be willing to abort Fedn.

D.S.	They wd. support Europeans – with troops etc.

P.M.	We can’t impose our will, materially – tho’ Br. public opinion thinks we can.

	Message to R.W.  Had report and hope it means he is shrinking from extreme course : send us yr. ideas on m. roll, a.m.  Will send you ours (simultaneously).

I.M.	But if we start new negotn. with R.W. &amp; impose m. roll equalising rolls &amp; with minimum percentage, African reaction wd. be v. bitter.

D.S.	R.W. will also insist on anti swamping provision.

C.S.	This means increasing qualifns. at each election – impossible.

I.M.	You can’t guarantee success of U.F.P. in elections and anything less he won’t accept.

P.M.	Message :  Had this message thro’ H. Commr. Cab. will meet again Tues.  M’while he shd. know we put aside m. roll some days ago, because thght it unacceptable to him &amp; to others.  But, if we had worked on it, it wd. have to take follg. form.  Enough to equalise races (?).  Don’t know if (it) wd. be acceptable because wd. be a form of equalisation.  Diff. to combine with minimum %age – guarantee v. irresponsible.  Thus, wd. like him think again at 60/40 tempered with %age system which wd. give adv. to Europeans.

D.S.	Then he wd. reject it out of hand.  Wd. dispose of m. roll.
	But if you want to play for time, reserve these arguments con for Alport.

I.M.	Must add min. qual. %age built in, on m. roll : otherwise Moffatt will resign.

D.S.	Don’t want to put detailed proposals to him at this stage.  Better let Alport talk to him.  

D.E.  	But telling A. we don’t believe in it.

P.M.	Answer must take form of inspn. to Alport to talk to 	R.W. – to extract from him what his proposals are for a middle roll.  (Avoid appearing to be putting new proposal of our own.)

		Agreed

P.M.	If R.W. comes here, we must have our plan (with 5 new points) announced – so that public know where we stand.

D.S.	Awkward timing, if he is coming to make a last appeal.  Wd. need to delay it until after he has seen P.M.

P.M.	Then prevent him from making statement at airport.
