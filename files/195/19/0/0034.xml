Leaves wide discretion to commander.

6.	Broadcasting : Subscription Television.	[Enter P.M.G.

R.A.B.	Seen Pilkington.  Views strongly held.  Stands by his lr. of Nov. wd. evidently throw his hand in, if we went ahead.  In this he has the support of his Cttee.

R.M.	Fear we must give way to him.

P.T.	Does he realise how small a thing this is.  No ques. of setting up a third body.  Experiment wd. cover only 3.000 homes : cd. be limited to 2 yrs.

R.M.	All those points have bn. put to P. – without result.

P.M.G.	Purpose of experiment is not to boost exports, but to capture the 3rd T.V. channel.  The Co. wd. put in whatever money is needed to ensure tht. experiment succeeded.

P.T.	But the U.S. competitor, which has made experiment, is getting ahead of our company.  At expenditure of £25.000 the co. could get a foot in export market.

	This is a wired experiment.

		Agreed  :  P.T. and R.M. authorised to put the commercial case 		    to Pilkington.
							[Exit P.M.G.

	
7.	Kenya.

I.M.	Opinion in K. is moving.  Business community wd. like to see the issue out of the way.

	Govr. won’t bargain – eg. if Africans decline Ministerial office unless K. is released.  But he wants to begin de-bunking him.  Thus, bring him nearer to civilisation : but people see him – Ministers &amp; Press.

	Draft statement by Govr. – in v. personal tone.  Wants to make it next week – after election is over.

P.M.	Trouble will begin if Africans won’t join Govt. until K. is out.
	On this Govr. is firm : he will, if necessary, assume direct rule.

Hail.	May become a place of pilgrimage.  Might build him up.

S.L.I.	Phrases in draft which might build him up.  Repetitn. of fears of his becoming a man of great influence.

R.A.B.	Prefer :  I will not release him until Govt. is working well.
		  
P.M.	Agree – no release : move to a nearer place : allow more visits (incldg. Press visits).  Take care there are no phrases in speech which, out of context, might suggest weakness.

		  [If it became a place of pilgrimage, he might have to be 	 	  moved again.]

	
8.	Sunday Observance.

M.	Trading : complicated by chain stores, which wdn’t open.

R.M.	Marginal advantage for tourism.

R.A.B.	Looks silly not to have enquiry.  Genl. p’mme of reforming our social laws.
