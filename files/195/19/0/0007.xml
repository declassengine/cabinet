C.C. 37(60)								23rd June 1960


		1.	Parliament			[Enter M.R., Prof. Craigton
			
R.A.B.	Business for next week.  Speakers in debate on steel de-nationalisation – R. Wood and Ch. Hill.  Debate on P.M. Motion on homosexuality – handling of division.  Debate on P.M. Mtg on 4/7.  P.M. and Alport to speak.  Allowances for car journeys by M.P.’s.  Opposn can’t support.  P.M. will reply to P.Q. to effect that this arrangement will not be introduced.


	2.	Cyprus

J.P.	Talks to be resumed to-day.  But now appears tht. G. Govt. have not put pressure promised on Makarios.


	3.	Housing Policy

H.B.	Govt. have held initiative on housing since ’51.  Shd. we retain it now, by a major Bill?  Main ques: subsidies.  Discontent in Party tht. these shd. continue to l.a.’s which make no move twds, economic rates.  But higher rates in cities wd. not be popular.  My plan wd. have effect of putting l.a.’s on a means test: no subsidy w’out proof of need (includg. satisfn on ques whr economic rates are being collected).  Propose no larger amount of Govt. money but more rational distribution of it.  Second main ques: do we try to break l.a. monopoly in houses built to let?  No incentive to private enterprise.  Good small l’lord has disappeared: most who remain are l’lords by inheritance not choice &amp; wd. prefer to get rid of their house – property.  Proposal: non-profit making h. assocns with Govt. subsidy. H.A. dislikes this plan: ready to try to find another.  But do we want a position counter to Labour plan of municipalisation?

H.A.	No main criticism of subsidy proposals.  Tho’ I had hoped for a reduction in net total.  Alarmed at prospect of subsidy for 2nd part of plan.  Not part of our philosophy.

R.A.B.	For the individual – higher rents are to be followed by higher rates.  Municipal elections next summer: we want to make big gains.  This plan wd. wreck that hope.  Is rating Bill essential this next session?  I wd. prefer to take housing first &amp; have the other to a later session.

H.B.	Bill for next session will be mainly industry – wh. will relieve house holder.  The new valuation date is the politically awkward one – i.e. 1963.  Political effects of housing Bill.

C.	Sc. Problem is same – this worse.  Timing: our revaluation comes first – ’61.  Growing feeling tht. council house rents shd. be raised – to relieve rates.

R.A.B	Will be a big load on next session’s legve. p’mme.

P.M.*	Small Ctt of Ministers to consider this paper and our one on Rating.

D.E.	Don’t exclude consideration of ques whr subsidy shd. be paid at all  for slum clearance.  We can’t afford to subsidise everything.

H.B.	I want to confine subsidies to – slum clearance, overspill, houses for old people and

				Agreed – as at *
					[Enter B.C., P.M.G., R.W., D.W.S


	4.	Legislative Programme

R.A.B	Next session – general conspectus.

I.M.	Sierra Leone – now to A.1.

E.M.	Trunk Roads shd. stand in B.2.

R.M.	Hope Weights + Measures can come in early – its ready.

C.	Scotland i) add a Bill on Flooding; ii) sheriffs pensions cd. be combined with Judicial Officers + kept in B.1. iii) Local Authorities (Publicity) is not suitable for Private Member.

D.E.	Education.  Libraries is prob. too long.  But school leaving age (small) cd. go in if agreement reached.

D.W.S.	Social Workers Bill won’t be ready for next session.

H.A.	Awkward if Crown Estate Bill can’t be done next session.  Might start in H/L.

R.A.B.	Usual plan to get Bills ready for introdn in autumn.

	Forward P’mmme

R.W.	Coal re-organisation Bill – for 1961/2.

R.A.B.	Wd. welcome more in acquisition suggn from colleagues.
						[Exit B-C., P.M.G. R.W., D.W.S.



	5.	Nuclear Weapons		[Enter C., G.W.

P.M.	Consider substance – not drafting of message.  i) Do we agree to having this tender here? ii)  Do we press for F. Wm via Glasgow? iii) Do we make it a condition that we have an option to come in? – buy or build.  iv) How do we handle relation of this with N.A.T.O  I.R.B.M.

H.A.	In general agreement.  Yes to (i).  On (iii) no more (and no less) than option.  If we join it, I wd. prefer to build here.  We cdn’t afford Sky bolt and Polaris at same time: periods of payment wd. have to over-lap.  On (iv) I cd. just accept words in draft, but alarmed at potential share of U.K. in this plan if it were agreed.

R.A.B.	Cd. we take this change to suggest closer co-opn on economic policies – U.K./U.S. – w’out which we can’t hope to give full support in world defence.  E.g. U.S. support of sterling/U.S. attitude on Europe.  In this or in a subsequent message.

P.M.	Cd send a separate message.  Magnitude of our defence contribn. &amp;close integration with U.S.  Must ensure tht. our economy can support it.

H.A.	But v. little practical work cd. be done with this Adminn.  And I wdn’t mention support for sterling because they are more nervous of the dollar.

C.	Loch Linnhe is OK – easier, technically, for entrance.  AEA are satisfied on safety – outside 3 miles from Fort Wm  Tho’, of course, inferior qua logistics.

S.S.	Don’t foreshadow, in first announcement, establishment of schools etc.,

E.M.	Can we put in a sentence about bldg. some part of U.S. sub. here?

C.	Won’t go well with U.S., who have never had any of their equipment built outside U.S.A.  Better to concentrate on bldg. our own here.

H.A.	COS support this Polaris project.
