  <content>C.C.14(61).							20th March 1961


		Federation of Rhodesia etc.,

P.M.	Difficult discns. with R.W.  Variety of plans.
	On 3 fifteens : we have agreed tht. existg. system of cross-voting cd. be extended to that : if proposed at Lusaka.

	We made it clear we weren’t commd. to 15:15:15 – nos. cd. be varied.
	Extension of franchise : we had said 1300-2000 people : he opposes lowering of standards, tho’ he is ready to include holders of particular posts.  We have said we won’t split on that.

	But he also objects to balancing for national seats : he believes averaging will produce wrong people : he insists tht. upper roll shd. dominate elections viz. a built in majority for Europeans (of his own Party).

	We made appeal to him this am. to play it long.

D.S.	Greenfield is trying to turn this into a negotiation : I have told him it can’t be – that must be in Lusaka.

	Welensky wd. like to accept our view.
	Greenfield continues to ask us to accept tht. upper roll shd. be dominant.  I have put it to him tht. if our plan can be shown to be impracticable Lusaka will have to devise something different.  We are prepd. to consider other solutions to problem wh. will give same result viz., tht. Parlt. will include an element dependent on votes of each side.
	Have advised them to put all their plans to Lusaka.  Dangerous to recommend plan 2. lest he thinks we have accepted it.  I have steadily made it plain tht. we are not “agreeing to anything” at this stage.

P.M.	Read draft of [joint] communiqué – hope R.W. can be brought to agree to it.  If he won’t, we cd. make unilateral statement in H/C.

I.M.	If R.W. will agree, we can play it long – possibly beyond referendum in S.R.H.
	
	His request for L.F.P. majority to be enshrined in constitn. – can’t be accepted.

D.E.	V. serious to go back on statement in Wh,. P. tht. can’t be built in majority for Europeans.

H.	We did think 15:15:15 wd. give built in majority for moderates black or white.  But, now we look at it, it seems poss. it may produce majority for irresponsible [blacks].

	Our ultimate aim is single roll with both African &amp; Europeans on it.
	That wd. be frustrated if extremists got control.

I.M.	Africans have described our plan as “sell out to moderates”.

K.	Scheme 3, I think, mght produce African majority. 24 seats on upper roll predominance – 16 European &amp; 8 African.  16 seats on lower roll – 12 in African areas.  Another 4 wh. Africans wd. win.

	This gives 23 Europeans &amp; 24 Africans.  Surely a concession (or mistake?) by R.W.

I.M.	But this scheme spells out principle tht. upper roll must dominate the election.  Does it too nakedly.  Still, he can put it forward.

H.	When wd. there be African majority on upper roll.  

I.M. 	8-10 years prs.

H.	Then they wd. be “responsible”.  

I.M.  	But he won’t admit tht. Africans on upper roll now are responsible.

P.M.	Our task is to persuade R.W. to allow his Party to negotiate.
	We must keep it going.  For if wh loses referendum Fedn. is bust anyway.  Object now is to prevent explosion.
	Suspicion in N.R. tht. we are negotiating with R.W.
