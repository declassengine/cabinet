		1.	Laos.					[Enter M.R., E. Boyle

P.M.	Read J.I.C. appreciation : military situation.

H.	U.S. adminn. reversing posn. of predecessors, decided in favour of neutral Laos &amp; political settlement.  Return of I.C.C. &amp; at some stage a conference.

	This was U.K. view.  But R. reluctant on I.C.C. and U.S. on conference.  But y’day I was able to send to R. an Anglo-U.S. p’posal.  Willing to contemplate conference of 14, provided cease fire occurs and is attested by I.C.C. (i.e. as in last Cab. minutes).  K. &amp; G. are away from Moscow : but initial response of Kremlin is not unfavourable.  M.K. Press conference today – hope he will hope R. will accept this, but he may add tht. U.S. can’t see Laos overrun.

	U.S. thinking of putting in force, if need be, to hold perimeter round Vientiane.  Tels. F.O. to W’ton 1677 and W’ton 740 read to Cabinet.

H.W.	Macnamara told me (with Burke’s aid) what they had in mind.
	They don’t want to intervene : but “can we stand aside &amp;see Laos wholly overrun?.

	They wd. first try intensified C.I.A. action –incldg. bombers.
	If that fails, they may (they have a plan) make overt intervention – airborne into Vietiane.  They want a Govt. with a foothold in the country, so tht. negotns. can proceed : and they will say so.  They wd. not need any material help from us.

H.	Only sensible mil. plan : defence of Thailand.  In Laos all you cd. do is hold Vientiane with talks to, &amp; supplies from Thailand.  But no negotns. wd. be poss. once U.S. troops moved in.  They cd. only sit in V.  To go beyond and try to secure the tongue running S. and E. of Siam wd. entail many more troops.

	Reactions from India &amp; Malaya – and in U.N.

H.W.	In reply to ques : U.S. mil. think this opn. cd. be done w’out n. weapons.

	Max. no. 10.000.  W’in 4 days after 4 days’ notice.

H.	C.I.A. activity need not preclude negotn.  Overt mil. intervention would.

H.W.	Feasible mil. opern. 

D.S. 	But doesn’t prevent Laos being overrun.

P.M.	But keeps Thailand with us; and keeps King of Laos in the country.

E.H.	U.S. wd. be in v. diff. posn. in U.N.  This action wd. be inconsistent with their attitude in U.N. on Congo.

P.M.	V. gt. problem &amp; turning point.  Not sure it’s in our power, or our interest, for us to comment on their mil. plans.  Our duty is to consider wthr. we shd. say anything on 2 tels. – warn them of its xdangers &amp;say we cdn’t be associated with it x i.e. pol. consequences, India : Malaya : U.N.) : also perhaps risk of developing into war (Korea or worse).  If they then went in, we wd. have to take a posn. : wdn’t want to lose our posn. in Anglo-U.S. axis.  If Laos goes, Thailand &amp; protected States may fall to Communists.  Dangerous to allow U.S. to feel that, when it comes to a crunch, they get no support – in S.E.A., so important to us &amp; especially to A. and N.Z.

	What do R. intend?  Hanging back on Tests.  In U.N. a v. bitter attack.
	Here : they cd. delay agreement to negotn. until L. overrun.
	Wd. it suit us for U.S. to get into this – and be forced to stay 20 years.
	Do we, or do we not, wish them to get embroiled?

I.M.	i)	Is this a sensible operation?  I think not.  We shd. say so to U.S.
	ii)	Do we support it?  If they go on with it, we shd. give moral 	support.

P.M.	Chief U.S. purpose is to stiffen Siam.

R.A.B.	Agree : this is an important point.

P.M.	Read draft of message to M.K.

I.M.	V. good.

D.S.	i)	omit promise of material support.
	ii)	put on record our feeling tht. operation cdn’t end at this.
	iii)	Trunker is in Ldn.  

P.M. 	Tell him what genl. sitn. is.

P.M.	On ii) we made the point in para.3 of 1677.

D.S.	Shd. like it on record in P.M.’s message.

H.W.	This is first big decision of new Adminn. : if they think we have let them down, on this, we needn’t expect good Anglo.U.S. co-opn. generally.

J.H.	I agree – point out dangers, but back them up.  

I.M. 	Yes : we must.

P.M.	If ?.K gives way on this, what does K. do on Berlin?  If he is bluffed out of this, he is done.

		Adjourned to 12.0. midnight.
