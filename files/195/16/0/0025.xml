C.C. 32(57). 9th April, 1957.

1. Suez Canal. [E.H., O.G.
P.M. U.S. have accepted our view – subject to one more round of exchanges
with E. Not bad.
O.G. A bit slow – fr. angle of getting de facto passage of ships begun.
P.M. View (from Brussels) tht. N.’s posn. wd. be shaken if ships held off for
a time.
H.W. Can’t hold Br. shipping for as long as that.
P.M. But oil cos. will hold off. Think U.S. time-table will do.
Crucial date is when No. 3 Account is opened. Wd. sooner that came
in the recess.
H.W. From Thurs. or Fri. of this week enough ships will be passing thro’
Canal to enable N. to say tht. traffic is resumed.
P.T. What we need is general expn. of view in S.C. tht. i) traffic shd. be
resumed but ii) E.’s attitude is unsatisfactory.
H.W. Wd. prefer that to happen on Fri. next rather than next week.
P.M. Don’t think we can press U.S. to follow a more rapid time-table. Will
verify that S.Ll. agrees – 6 p.m. to-day.
H.W. Fr., Dutch and Danish Govts. are all advising ship-owners to avoid use
of Canal.
P.M. Fr. genl. discn. in S.C. there shd. emerge :-
i) as negotn. must take time, world-trade must go on and they
think interim arrangemts for paymt. must be made.
ii) SCUA meeting to discuss and endorse (i).
iii) Ty. action to enable B. ships to pay.
In that event (iii) can be presented as inevitable international act.
And (ii) need not wait on concln. of (i).
Tel. 830. Avoid pro. tem. telling State Dpt.
[Exit O.G.
[Enter J.H., Soames, O.Ewing.
2. National Service.
I.M. i) 279.000 needed. ii) 570.000 available : of wh. 330.000 are young and
240.000 deferred. iii) A quarter’s regn produces 30.000 fit young
men.
Reduction from ii) to i) can’t be secured by higher standards etc.,
Choice is therefore betwn. memo. and ballot.

The no. deferred plus one quarter call-up gives all we need. But if only
one more call-up, nearly all intake wd. be older and qualified men.
Need mixture of young and older. Hence plan of 2 registers from
which we wd. draw in fixed proportions – 2 older to 1 younger.
If we increase propn. of young, we lengthen period of uncertainty and
also relieve more deferred men of their oblign.
Wd. like early announcemt. of end of normal call-up of young – to
enable plans (Universities etc.,) to be made.
If we don’t get regular recruitment – we shall need legn. and the ballot.
D.S. Support this plan. Must consider further the propn. of young and oil.
J.H. Good plan. Shall need to regulate the flow from the 2 sources.
Warning : believe we shall be 20.000 men short by 1960, on
present condns. If we can improve those, we have reasonable
chance of getting force of 165.000 regulars by 1962. By end ’59
we shall have had 2 yrs’ experience of recruiting under new
condns. If it isn’t going well enough, we shd. then have to bring
in another N.S. plan with legn.
C.S. No need of N.S. in R.N. Our diffy. will be rejecting applicants for
regular service.
O.E. Best plan that we can devise. We shall prob. need more young than
old – for dirty jobs. Hope propns. will remain flexible and won’t be
announced as rigid.
I.M. Think we must announce – but need not be for more than one year at a
time.
P.M. Avoids legn. and the ballot. Enables us to say tht. men born after certain
date won’t be called up.
Disadvantage : some older men relieved at expense of young. Highage
call-up even of young twds. end of scheme.
But only poss. alternative = ballot.
Pol. diffy. less at outset – but prs. more as adminn. goes on.
R.A.B. As time goes on, gap in age betwn. 2 groups increases. Why not, of
deferred group, take youngest vice oldest?
I.M. Doubt if it wd. work. Not much scope for choice – when reason for
deferment expires (apprenticeship etc.,) they must be called up.
P.T. Qua natl. economy, fewer skilled men called up the better. The 2:1
ratio may give Services more skilled men than they need.
D.S. Considerg. how R.N. cd. take over duties h’to discharged by Army so
as to avoid rejecting regular recruits.
94
J.M. Teachers. V. acute shortage in Scotland. Pressure for total exemptn.
Cd. we get same benefit by difft. means.
I.M. I can meet this – indefinite deferment, while in teaching post.
P.M. When it is known to be ending, principle of universality is less sacred.
H.A. Cd. we defer balance of agricultural workers – 3.000 p.a.
H. Will be pol. trouble. Fairest method wd. be ballot. This will have to
be justified as better for the national economy.
E.H. Pol. criticism will be : this is selection by Minister not by even
chances.
I.M. In fact no more selection than now.
M. Better than blind chance. Opposed to deferment by class – wd. cause
trouble with T.U.’s.
Memo. approved.
