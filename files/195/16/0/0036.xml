C.C. 45(57). 6th June, 1957.

1. Ministerial Statements. [Enter E.M., A.N., J.H.
P.M. Avoid policy statements when abroad – when it may appear that there
has bn. no recent opportunity for consultn. with colleagues. May
appear to weaken collective responsibility.
2. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for week after recess.
First day – in Cttee. – debate on Gowers Rpts. Speakers : R.A.B. and
I.M. to settle.
P.M. Not 2 Cab. members.
3. Home Guard.
J.H. No duty on anyone to m’tain it : no procdgs. cd. therefore be taken.
But want power to raise it again, if need be.
Propose therefore to announce disbandment (end/July) but to promise
legn. at earliest convenient date.
Att.G. Believe you cdn’t rely on Act of 1951 to raise it again.
J.H. * Wd. include clause in a Reserve Forces Bill : not separate legn.
Agreed : disband and announce. include legn in Reserve Forces
Bill as at *.
[Exit J.H., Att.G.
[Enter Perth.
4. Legislative Programme : 1957/58.
R.A.B. As in memo.
Major Bills – general agreement.
Betting and Gaming – wd. like Bill prepared : but am not v. keen. Duty
rather than pleasure.
Credit Training – agreed : omit.
Minor Bills – get this list ready.
Suggest addition of Bill on adoption and protection of children. Want it
got ready. Scots want Deer. Suggest it be drafted.
K. Important to complete in this Parlt. the surrender of emergency
controls. To close this book, we must get some of the minor ones
thro’ e.g. Defence (Designs).
H. Cession of Christmas Island. Pretty small and non-controversial.
137
H.B. New Towns : i) a minor money Bill which is essential but small.
ii) a policy Bill in Session after next. It wd. be popular
with Party. Add to para. 9.
P. i) C. Development Corpn. Bill will be needed – but perhaps it can
replace Colonial Loans.
ii) Oversea Civil Service shd. be promoted to List A or A.1.
Jamaica Dependencies shd. be in A.1., not in both.
[Exit Perth.
5. Cancer of the Lung.
D.V. This is minimum. My own inclination wd. be to do more. I do not
favour centralised publicity campaign.
P.T. There is no form of human activity that does us any good – cf.
reference to atmospheric pollution. We may be called on to do
more than it wd. be sensible to do in the way of stopping things.
P.M. Have Govt. a duty to take a line on this. Difference between
contagious or infectious diseases and this.
Amend para. 2. “think it right” vice “duty”.
Amend para 6. “particularly in the heavy smoking of cigarettes”.
6. Egypt : British Evacuees. [Re-enter J.H.
P.T. As in memo.
A.N. F.O. support. Don’t recommend un-blocking of assets.
H. Cd. hold situation during summer – save for awkward point about
savings certificates.
Hail. Ty. have now agreed to allow G.P.O. to pay in individual cases “on
merits” : and that will do.
Hail. But I can’t understand or defend para. 9 – sentence one.
P.T. This is decision of Banks, not Ty.
P.M. Distinguish between genuine E. banks and banks sequestrated by E.
x/ “banks in Egypt” is at least ambiguous.
P.T. Will consider this and see wtr it can be thrown in, with the package.
P.M. No announcement until after Recess. N. is under substantial financial
pressure.
[Exit J.H.
138
7. Roads Programme.
H.W. Lag of 3 years betwn. decision and money being spent. Backlog of 16
years. No work done save scraps. Unless we can move now, we
shall have sorry story to tell at Election.
Roads are of gt. commercial importance.
We ought to start work on key trunk routes. But, if I do so, there will
be little over for small jobs all over the country. These jobs wd.
fall from over £70 M. to £40 Mm.
No big money wd. be committed until contracts placed – wh. wd. be 2
years ahead. M’while, only planning, land-purchase etc., If
investment had to be cut back at outset of new Parlt. this p’mme
cd. be cut as cd. others.
J.M. My claim is comparable.
P.T. Have authorised 50% increase. Don’t wish to go higher.
H.W. 50% on an inadequate p’mme does give an adequate one.
R.A.B. U.S. spending more on roads than on education. Consider this again
with investment p’mme as a whole.
P.M. What do we have to spend in order to be in a posn. to expand later?
That surely is the realistic approach. Let us look at it thus when
we see investment p’mme as a whole.
Agreed : resume discussion later.
8. Export of Cattle.
H.A. Recommn. tht. trade be limited to smaller countries – to exclude
France. We have now consulted other Govts. Dutch and Germans
have met us. French have come some way but still want trade to
go down to South of France.
Another mtg. on 19/6: shall have to put definite plan to them.
Humanitarian campaign is bldg. up in U.K.
A.N. Difficult to discriminate v. France.
H.A. May F.O., Ty., Sc. and M/Ag. settle the line? Agreed.
