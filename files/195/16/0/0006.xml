C.C. 3 (57) 24th January, 1957

1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.
Privilege.
R.A.B. Mr. Junor. If he is contumacious, shall move that he be put in custody
of Serjeant-at-Arms.
P.M. Penalty (e.g. fine) will bring H/C. into difficulty. How enforce it?
L.P. After reprimand, cd. not someone bring it to Press Council.
P.M. Some doubt about merits?
R.A.B. M.P.’s have bn. reasonably treated – not getting as much as doctors.
But it is open to ques wtr allowances to pol. Parties wasn’t
excessive. Agents are now reviewing their needs with a view to
adjustment.
Homicide Bill.
R.A.B. Abolitionists are determined to obstruct. Shall delay guillotine notion
until next week : it may not be needed – if we sit late on Monday
and make more use of closure.
P.M. “Unusual to guillotine a hanging Bill”!
R.A.B. Business for next week.
[Enter Vosper
2. Remuneration of Doctors.
D.V. Since Cab. in July, my predecessor saw doctors’ repves. twice. Despite
his stand, failure in confidence – on last occasion because he said
he wd. consult again with colleagues.
R.Commn. proposal – for reasons in memo. : also because weight is
needed to overcome Spens.
Reasonable chance of getting acquiescence of doctors. Anyhow,
alternatives in memo. wd. be worse.
If no action, some risk of doctors w’holding service of leave N.H.S.
Supposed to meet them on 5/2, tho’ it cd. be p’poned.
J.M. Mood in Scotland is v. awkward.
R.Commn. alone won’t appease them. Wd. accompany it by admissn.
of hardship cases.
P.T. Support plan for R. Commn. Must play it long.
y| Agree somethg. must be done by interim relief for those under £1450.
20
There are other groups – lower judiciary, Dons, M.P.’s and Ministers.
Wd. like to move simultaneously on all these, when wages
demands have passed peak.
Wd. wish to discuss y/ with Ministers concerned – for incln. in general
packet.
Compn. of R.C. will need thought. Fear Judge as Chairman, after
Dankwerts. May I discuss this?
Extensn. to drs. outside N.H.S. will cause diffy. – e.g. with Universities
Must have careful formula for this.
L.P. Agree research posts raise wider issues.
Med. research outside N.H.S. is at present penalised – e.g. no
merit awards.
But concession to them will give rise to claims from other
faculties.
Enquiry can’t be limited narrowly to N.H.S.
I.M. Support L.P.’s view.
Salaries £1200-£2000 are middle class, whom we want to help.
Need R. Commn. to get away from Spens.
Composn. : don’t let T.U.C. nominate a man : we shd. pick one.
D.E. Raises immense social ques. Competn. of professions for output of 6th.
Forms. With taxn. as now, progessions haven’t enough pull in
shape of plums at top. Don’t want to spend money on middle
piece.
C.H. Must make a fresh start – to get away fr. Spens and Dankwerts. B.M.A.
p.r. work is good and must be countered: in form of “new start”.
Don’t have Judge as Chairman.
2nd. part of t. of r. : machinery for periodic reviews : may imply regular
adjustment by ref. to c/living.
Govt. shd. determine, w’out negotiation, interim relief for hard cases.
Also R. Commn. shd. be presented as decn., w’out consultn.
P.M. “Not often that Frankenstein is able to advise”!
P.M. Present R. Commn., as decision. Agreed.
Composn. Chairman other than Judge: and
(1) careful choice – not nominees.
T. of reference. Take a/c of remuneration in other professions
etc.,
P.T. with Ministers concerned to frame revised proposals.
(2) Interim relief for hard cases. P.T. to discuss with Dpts.
(3) P.T. to discuss with I.M. the timing of salary changes as a group.
[Exit D.V.

3. Oil Supplies.
M. E.P.C. y’day. Supplies better than hoped. But running down stocks and
posn. may be difficult in April.
Texas etc., W’ton tel. 123.
Recommend : i) we tell industry no cut in March.
ii) timing of announcement to be left to me.
P.T. M/P. is talking to cos. here. Wd. await result before taking any further
action in U.S.
M. Caccia has had some effect.
100% of what we want fr. Texas wd. be only 5% addn. for Europe.
P.M. M/D. shd. see tht. all practicable economies in consumptn. are
enforced.
H.W. Waste by farmers is causg. indignn. Cd. N.F.U. come out v. it?
