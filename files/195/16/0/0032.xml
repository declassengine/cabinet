C.C. 41 (57) 16th May, 1957

1. Suez Canal. [Enter E.H.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
2. House of Lords Reform.
H. Pledged in Q. Speech to some measures of reform.
If a comprehensive measure, Lord S.’s was best. Hail.’s –
innocent looking, is worse – for abolishes hereditary right and
leaves ultimate selection to P.M. Prefer a short Bill, reversing
Wensleydale : Women : a system of pay : organise voluntary
absenteeism as against b’woodsmen : and possibly cl. 3 of
Hailsham’s Bill. Can be defended as a holding measure.
K. Present as salvage measure to enable H/L. to continue. Believe we cd.
get it thro’.
Hail. Agree this is better line than Ld. S.’s comprehensive measure. Public
wdn’t have liked selection by Peers themselves – or abolition of
swamping.
My Bill is not so revolutionary. Since 1910 there have bn resolutions
favouring plan by wh. elder sons are not compelled to take seat.
Under my plan, sons of Peers like others wd. be selected to sit as
Lords of Parliament.
Waste of money to have different registers for local : Parly. elections
because Peers can’t vote in latter.
Candidature for H/C. is rational in 20th. Century. Anyhow, distinction
between me and Ld. Winterton is most illogical.
D.S. They can’t chop and change.
Hail. But no reason why a young man shdn’t sit in H/C. and yet sit in H/L. at
a riper age. Only ques : for how long a period shd. be
disqualified for H/L.
H. Debate in July putting fwd. these plans : legn. early in next session.
P.T. On expenses : if tax is to be avoided, Revenue must be satisfied they
contain no element of remuneration. Hard to prove that in
relation to any figure much above £3.
H. Cd. hardly propose less that £4.
P.M. Content. His plan can be represented as moderate and practical plan to
facilitate opern. of 2nd. Chamber. Avoids raising whole ques of
hereditary rights etc., Wd. prefer so to represent it. That
123
excludes Hail’s frills. Doesn’t abolish swamping power – avoids
that issue. But cd. Swinton plan be said to produce Salisbury’s
result by other means.
K. No sanction – entirely voluntary. Cdn’t stop a Peer who attended
despite his havg. opted out for the session.
P.M. Be careful not to allow it to be represented as self-election.
H. Not essential to my plan : but shd. help to meet Labour attitude re
b’woodsmen.
P.M. Wd. prefer to separate it – allow H/L. to add it later.
H. Ready to omit it from my plan as presented. Agreed.
Timing.
P.M. As this is limited plan, is it wise to leave from July to Nov. open to
argument. Cd. we proceed at once with a Bill, at opening of next
session.
H. Can’t escape debate in July – Samuel will bring one on.
Wd. avoid specific promise of Bill in autumn.
P.M. May be easier for Labour leaders to acquiesce if we avoid larger debate
and launch small practical Bill.
D.S. Cd. we get this Bill thro’ in this session?
P.M. And deal with Ministers’ and Members pay at same time. A package
deal.
E.H. P’mme in H/C. is full already.
Altho’ a simple Bill, wd. take some time.
K. But what amendmts. cd. be tabled if only principle was creation of Life
Peers.
P.M. Every advantage in pushing it all thro’ in this Session.
E.H. Even a one-clause Bill wd. occupy 4 days in H/C.
D.S. Not if Bill were so drawn as to exclude amendmts.
P.M. Study i) dealing with whole thing this session.
ii) debate in spill over and introduce Bill at outset of new
session.
124
P.T. Alternative : announce whole package incldg. H/C. pay in July, but
defer H/L. Bill and Ministers’ salaries Bill until next session.
P.M. V. well. {Aim at pay of H/C. and H/L. and Ministers’ salaries by July H/L.
{reform debate in spill-over. Remaining legn. next session.
But that is 2nd. best – to disposing of whole thing in favourable
atmosphere created by pay (M.P.’s and Ministers) concessions.
3. Wages and Prices.
P.T. As in memo.
P.M. Error not to include reference to “full emplt.” Wd. arouse suspicion.
I.M. Agree : but wd. reserve it – for addn. in response to T.U.C.
P.M. Don’t want it said they extorted it from us. Prefer to put it in ourselves
at outset.
But I prefer my own original (Chequers) formula – subject to “full emplt.”
for a “high level”. Agreed.
P.M. Duration. Appoint members for 2 years?
I.M. Prefer 3 years.
P.T. Title : “Production and Incomes Cttee.” Agreed
H.A. Commn. vice Cttee. Agreed – consider.
Proposals on procedure – approved.
4. Export of French New Potatoes.
Note not taken.
