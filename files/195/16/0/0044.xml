C.C. 54 (57) 18th July, 1957

1. Parliament. [Enter E.H., J.H.
RAB. Business for next week.
Disarmament : Tuesday. Govt. spokesmen : S.Ll. and prob. A.N.
Inflation : Thursday. Govt. spokesmen : P.T. opens and P.M. replies.
Motion of censure on Att. Genl. Propose that Govt. shd. ignore it.
Spker’s advisers agree. Att.G. is content. Oppn. may press for
debate – mght get it in on Monday, in their time.
Summer Recess. Rise 2/8. Re-assemble 29/10. Spill-over of only 3
days. New session : 5/11.
2. International Court.
S.Ll. Last Apl. we altered terms of our acceptance of jurisdn. of Int. Court.
We didn’t inform Parlt. at the time. It may now become known.
Our defence had better be : interim adjustment, we are still
considerg our final position. Coming out because mentioned in a
judgment of the Internatl. Court.
3. Defence Policy.
P.M. Present proposal : 4 statements, on consecutive days. Not v. good
procedure. Statements in general are unwise – puts Minister at a
disadvantage.
I.M. Mine cd. be combined with D.S. on compensation.
R.A.B. Shd. aim at fewer statements. P.M. cd. usefully do the whole lot.
P.M. I cd. do it on Tuesday. Foreshadowing various White Papers.
J.H. Don’t wish to seem to be avoiding unpopularity. I wd. have preferred
to do it myself.
Agreed : single statement by P.M.
[Exit J.H.
[Enter B.C.
4. Pensions.
R.A.B. Existing rates must go up. Must be done on old scheme because no
time to work out means of doing it otherwise. If done alone, will
have to be loaded more in interest of Exchequer. 18/4 p. card. If
done with another scheme in mind it mght be done for 17/6.
163
Other reasons for further scheme – i) existg. scheme is not sound. ii)
public wish for extension of supplementary schemes.
We therefore submit compromise plan of graduated scheme. Stops at
£750 in order to leave field for life offices. More favourable to
Exchequer in long run: vid. Table.
Reduces State intervention to a single scheme. Simple. Adminve.
advantages.
M/L. and M/P. wd. accept this only if there were contractg. out. This
mght ruin the plan. We wd. need to consider it further. Life
offices think it possible, but that it’s absence wd. not cripple
them. They shd. however, be seen by Ministers. But if
contractg. out won’t work we shall have to devise alternative
plan.
B.C. Wd. welcome decisions on the 2 points i) level of early increases ii)
nature of new plan.
Only one more move in this Parlt. Hence favour 10/= and removal of
tobacco concession.
Timing : announce before recess and pass legn. in spill-over. Legislate
early in new session : and bring into opn. in April.
On ii) : this is compromise. Don’t like it : resembles Crossman : doubt
wtr figures are sound. Contractg. out: even Crossman makes
some provn. for that : wrong for Tory Govt. to encroach on field
of life offices w’out enabling those in sound private schemes to
contract out.
I.M. Support R.A.B.’s proposal. Doubt if we cd. go fwd. w’out contractg.
out. But if that is feasible the scheme cd. be commended to our
Party.
P.T. Crossman plan is inflationary. Has not, for that reason, made the
impact expected. We shd. certainly not out-bid it.
On (i) – no early impact on Ty. On economy will give some impetus
to cost inflation. Will be pressure for more when 2nd. scheme
announced. 10% is above subsistence : 5/= (with no change on
tobacco) wd. be enough.
On (ii) best compromise. Contractg. out shdn’t be made a dogma. If
life offices con’t insist on it : decn. shd. be allowed to turn on
adminve. considns.
M. C. out is needed because large no. of women who already pay 6% of
salaries in contns.
B.C. Don’t come in if under £8 p.wk.
M. Not many are below that.
I.M. Party view as well as life offices must be considered – on contractg.
out.
164
P.M. Ordinary rate shd. go up by an amount wh. will last this Parlt.
Graduated scheme : contractg. out must be considered from
practical and political angle.
In any event no one benefits before 1960 – viz., not in this Parlt.
Get practical views on contractg. out (not political) before Cab.
next discussion.
Consider wtr 2nd. piece of legn. need come in before Xmas. Tho’
decn. earlier because if we are to do it contn. on flat-rate
plan cd. be lower.
M/P. to consider wtr practicable to bring in 1st. plan by Xmas.
5. Persian Gulf : Muscat. [Exit B.C.
P.M. Rebellion of tribes v. Sultan of Muscat. Saudi encouragement. Certain
forts seized. We have supported Sultan – Buraimi onwards. We
must help him. Rebels will declare themselves independent, and
they are likely to get support fr. State Dpt. and Aramco.
We can i) send Br. co. to Buraimi. ii) authorise despatch of Trucial
levies to rescue some of Sultan’s men who are cut off. iii) R.A.F.
to drop supplies and arms to them. iv) 1 frigate ordered in and 1
more can follow. Ques is wtr, in addn., we shd v) shoot up one of
the forts, seized by the rebels. Def. Cttee. have agreed to i) to iv).
Argument against v) : howl from Saudis, Egypt and prs. U.S.
Argument for : overwhelmg. moral effect in whole area of our
showing our teeth. May nip this in bud and save us genl. campaign
wh. world opinion wd. deplore.
S.Ll. Internationally we shd. have no trouble by progressive use of ground
troops. Prompt air action will certainly arouse criticism : and by
no means certain that one sortie will finish it.
x| But on balance I wd. favour authorising A.O.C. to do it if he is
| satisfied that is necessary to success of genl. opn. as contempl.
| para 3 of Tel. 77. Rockets not bombs.
D.S. All these Rulers are lookg. to see wtr we shall support them or let them
down. Ques. : is wtr we do this now or later.
H. Rebels are in mountains : can’t be dealt with save by land action. Is it
necessary to bomb.
D.S. Risk of Arab support for “independence”. Then Br. action is even
more difficult.
H. What is value of bombing Muscat’s forts after rebels have left it. You
are to ask them to leave before you bomb.
P.M. Agree if isolated : but envisaged as part of larger operation in wh.
ground troops mop up.
165
Agreed : as at x/.
D.S. to instruct C-in-C., in consultn. S.Ll.
6. Roads.
H.W. Ty. and M/T. have bn discussing roads p’mme. Unless I can get my
minimum figure (23%) I cdn’t defend road p’mme – in debate on
Monday.
