C.M. 3(57). 8th January, 1957.

1. Western Europe.
S.Ll. Atmosphere in Eur. friendly – and expectant of a lead from us.
i) Para. 25. Rationalisation of proliferating “Assemblies”. A single
Assembly, with functional Cttees. – with no executive functions.
Concomitant of other plans : wd. please Parliamentarians. Wd. be
of some use and no harm.
ii) Economic Approach. Plan G. and Euratom. Going on as fast as it can.
iii) Military and Political Assocn.
We can’t sustain present defence burden. Won’t be easy merely
to cut it by £200 M. Better prs. to share burden with other
European countries. NATO is of little use for burden-sharing.
Military bureaucracy is too big. W.E.U. wd. be a better machine
because smaller and more closely knit. This plan wd. be well
received by other members – even if it didn’t include the nuclear.
Don’t believe we can alone be a nuclear military power: not a 3rd.
Power comparable to U.S. and Sov. Union. Is there any point in
acquiring know-how and then stopping? Shd. we not instead try to
become, with rest of Europe, a 3rd. nuclear force. Tho’ we cd.
insist tht. H. bomb be manufactured only in U.K.
Memo. may prs. over-emphasise oppn. to U.S. this cd. be done in coopn.
with them.
L.P. Recognise diffies. of F.O. in framing new policy to meet new circs. But
am disturbed by this.
Don’t accept assumptn. in para. 4 tht. it’s nuclear armament tht. will
bankrupt us.
But my main diffy. is tht. this seems inconsistent with m’tenance of
Anglo-U.S. Alliance. This will be regarded in U.S. as attempt to
build up 3rd. Force. Many of phrases in memo. suggest this.
Choice of nuclear as basis for such an approach is specially
unfortunate qua U.S. – whose whole policy is to prevent
extension of nuclear to other countries. This is main purpose of
new U.S. disarmament plan – with which this policy is
inconsistent.
U.S., if they became hostile to us over this, cd. hit us v. hard. They cd.
prevent our getting uranium fr. Canada. They cd. get ?rds of
what we hope to obtain fr. S. Africa.
Choices in para. 17. There shd. be a fourth – closer co-opn. with U.S.
Our aim shd. be to regain what we have lost, recently, in Anglo-U.S.
relations.
Part III. Surely it wd. be wrong to approach anyone w’out first
squaring it entirely with U.S. That wd. repeat again the cardinal
error we made over Suez. It mght destroy what remains of
US/U.K. Alliance. If this policy were to be launched at all, it
shd. be put to U.S. in first instance as part of a full exposé of our
defence and foreign policy.
6
H. Integratn. with Europe on mily. and nuclear policy wd. mean tht. we lost
all co-opn. with U.S. and Canada on techniques and prs. supplies of
nuclear.
We cdn’t go forward with this plan save after fullest consultn. with
U.S. and Doms.
Better surely to seek better co-opn. with U.S. in mil/nuclear field. We
have much to contribute to that common cause.
A.H. Sympathise with L.P.’s attitude.
Practical points :
i) Fr., Germany and Italy can’t m’tain mil. morale without atomic
capacity. French and Italians have already asked U.S. for it. We
cdn’t in fact supply them w’in 7-10 years. U.S. cd. do it in a year
or two, if they wished. U.S. cd. therefore break this plan at will.
V. risky therefore to float it save with full U.S. co-opn.
ii) “We don’t want Europe to make nuclear; tho’ we accept that
they must have it.” That is U.S. view on N.A.T.O. Believe they
are near the point of providing nuclear weapons for Eur. forces,
including our own.
iii) Para. 17. Nuclear exp’re is not vast, in reln. to def. exp’re. as a
whole. Little over 10% of the whole : and all the material is
capable of civil use. It is not a crushing burden itself.
iv) If scheme adopted, contributors wd. want to own product.
They wd. have key to own cupboard. Shd. we give that to
Germany. U.S. wd. oppose it : U.K. opinion wd. itself be
nervous of it.
W.M. Para. 7. If that is foundn. of policy, then will be gt. diffies. with U.S.
over security. Denial of informn. to us wd. be likely.
Para. 8. Consultn. before use wd. reduce deterrent value – if 7 Powers
had to be consulted.
Para. 17(b) – a limited nuclear Power, tho’ not comparable with U.S. and R.
D.S. Favour concept of closer co-opn. with Europe. Cab. have endorsed G.
Plan which is foundation of it.
Anglo-U.S. Alliance is vital to security of Western world. But recent
events make it inevitable tht. there shd. be some change in our
relns. with U.S. Agree tht. we shdn’t run after them. They
respect success, wealth and strength : we are now at a low ebb in
each respect. We must get into a show which can talk on level
with U.S. Obvious tht. we can’t now get it alone : they deny us
the special posn. which is our due. If it has to be founded on
econ. strength and power, we must seek tht. in assocn. with others.
Memo. puts too much stress on mil. and pol. side.
Our aim shd. be closest relns. with Europe, short of Federation. Can’t
yet see what precise shape that wd. take.
We have a chance to seize leadership in Europe.
But I wd. start from G. Plan – not mil, or nuclear.
Decide in principle on closer assocn. and see how it works out.
7
Be more active in Ministerial Cttee. of C/Europe.
Let W.E.U. Powers be collectively, not separately, active in N.A.T.O.
Dubious of suggn. in memo. tht. U.S. and Canada shd. be
associated with European organisations. Wd. weaken European
idea.
P.T. Agree with LP. Nuclear is wrong card of entry for Eur. unity. That
wd. array rest of world v. our efforts to unite Europe. And arouse
antagonism of U.S.
Assemblies. Room for rationalisation. But don’t throw any cards
away, for critical point in negotiating free trade area : Canada is
becoming suspicious.
Procedure. Don’t float any of these ideas with Spaak now.
K. My views are close to those of D.S. Tho’ on nuclear, shaken by L.P.’s
statement.
Need for policies wh. will rally Party. On domestic front, we have
recognised need for positive policy giving more hope for future.
In f. policy that cd. come fr. closer assocn. with Europe. Nothing
in that wh. need be inconsistent with m’tenance of our relns. with
U.S. and Doms. “Can’t invest from a deficit” : Europe as source of
capital for investment overseas.
Can’t get unity of policy in Commonwealth. India/Pak/S. Africa
illustrate our differences. Easier to keep new Doms. with us in a
Commonwealth of Strength (?) U.S. favour Europn. assocn.
We have a chance to seize leadership of Europe.
Therefore, even if Part I of memo., is dropped, hope that won’t be fatal
to broad ideas in Part II.
H.A. Favour expanding assocn. with Europe. Doubt wtr nuclear is right card
of entry. But –
Anglo-U.S.-Canadian alliance is best safeguard of world peace.
Therefore, pre-requisite of any move twds Europe is full consultn.
with U.S. as well as Doms.
Tho’ we have for the time lost our special posn. with U.S., we shd. be
unwise to abandon hope of achieving some (new perhaps) posn.
of special relationship with them.
We shdn’t make such a move as this w’out consultg. Canada as well as
U.S.
Ll.G. Drew attentn. to last sentence of para. 15.
Para. 29. Plan cd. strengthen N.A.T.O.
L.P.S. But nuclear ques is dynamite in U.S. Their disarmament plan is clearly
designed to achieve opposite result.
D.E. Para. 17. Why shd. we have H. bomb at all? We wd. never threaten to
use it w’out U.S. concurrence.
8
Why not associate Eur. w’out H. bombs. Leave U.S. to neutralise R.
Beware of seeking prestige vice power. Latter will go to the rich
not those who are strong in nuclear terms.
H.M. Fr. internal as well as external pt. of view we need a new theme, in wh.
Eur. as well as Comm. and Anglo-U.S. shd. play a part. No real
inconsistency. We have entered the game with Plan G. card –
with sympathy of U.S. and Doms. That has encountered gt.
technical diffies, wh. Spaak is coming over to discuss.
Ready to develop general Europ. assocn. – tho’ not on nuclear theme.
Welcome early consultn. on this with U.S. and Canada – on basis
tht. they have always favoured this and we are ready to have a
crack at it. Looks as tho’ U.S. are nervous of U.N. We mght
suggest it wd. be useful if we developed Europ. bloc in U.N.
Nuclear. Cost is £150 M now. But don’t believe we can lay it off on
Europe.
Remember tht. Europe can’t live at all unless U.S. protects M/E. This
is not therefore a moment to challenge them on so sensitive a
matter as nuclear.
Timing. See first how we get on with Spaak on G. plan. But shd. like
soon to be in posn. to discuss such an approach with U.S. and old
Doms. Same preliminaries as for Plan G.
S.Ll. i) Hope there is general agreement tht. we shd. try to get into closer
association with Europe.
L.P. Shd. wish to reserve my posn. on extent of it. Tho’ don’t dissent with
H.M.’s summing up.
S.Ll. ii) Better Alliance with U.S. if part of a show which can speak to
them on level terms.
iii) Emphasis on mil. and nuclear because diffies. in m’taining our
defence effort – incldg. our diffy. in m’taining our forces in G.
Closer co-opn. in W.E.U. wd. ease those diffies.
Agree tht. we needn’t begin with nuclear. But we cd. explore
means of closer mil. assocn. thro’ W.E.U.
iv) Wd. not wish to rest wholly on Plan G. Wd. wish to show some
initiative on mil. and pol. association also.
L.P.S. Result of this discussion shd. be reported to P.M.
A.H. Europeans in N.A.T.O. held fast to earlier commitments – we were
only exceptn. in notifying redn. W.E.U. and N.A.T.O. won’t like or
accept it easily. As sole defaulter, we are not a good posn. to
make a bid for leadership.
What have we to offer.
H.M. Disposed to start with pol., rather than mil., assocn.
9
L.P.S. Confine any talks to pol. assocn. pro. tem. Concert with A.H. before
any discussions are opened on Mily association.
