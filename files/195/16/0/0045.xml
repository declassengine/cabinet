C.C. 56(57). 23rd July, 1957.

1. Persian Gulf: Oman. [Enter B.C.
S.Ll. No more informn. : nothing therefore to say in H/C. : But House will
expect something. And debate is on M/D. and F.O. votes – and
can be discussed.
H.A. U.S. re-action?
S.Ll. Suspiciously quiet. We have told them what we intend.
P.M. And I have sent personal message to President.
2. Steel Prices.
P.T. Steel Bd. had planned to announce on Wed. their expansion plans and
increased prices. Now propose to have it announced by Bd. on
Thursday, and I can refer to it in debate.
Agreed.
3. Industrial Disputes.
R.A.B. Have asked Police to look out for violent acts of intervention.
Cov. Gdn. strike spreadg. to lorry-drivers. Potatoes are getting short in
Ldn. Emergencies Cttee is mtg.
I.M. Wd. be helpful if prosecn. or two cd. be taken. Cousins is seeking to
spread the strikes. But Cov. Gdn. is showg. how little the porters
did.
Award of Tribunal likely to be available on Thurs. – may afford basis
for a settlement. An award of 7/6 wd. be right.
4. Transport Commission: Purchasing Policy.
H.W. Have received report of commission on Mr Gethin’s allegn. Sir H.
Howitt will examine report and general purchasing policy of
B.T.C. Wish to announce this on Wed. in reply to P.Q. Both
reports will be publd.
5. Pensions. [Enter B.C.
P.M. Have discussed procedure. Irrespective of decn. on larger Bill we shd.
have to raise o.a.p. rates. Shd. need two Bills. Content of first
167
wd. turn on decn. on second. Cd. be introduced on 29/x: reintroduced
on first day of new session (5/xi) : and taken
immediately after Queen’s Speech. To secure early operation we
shd. need to decide, before recess, amount of pension. Printing
mght begin in Sept. – acceptg. risk of leak. Opern. cd. then be
early Jan. or conceivably by Xmas.
R.A.B. That wd. do. Avoids speeches etc., during recess. Announcement not
earlier than Party Conference.
We cd. manage 2 Bills. But must know content of 2nd. before
introducg 1st.
B.C. Criticism wd. be : paymt. before Xmas means 17/12. Re-rating takes
5 wks. Shd. have to announce by 5/xi tht. pensioners shd. bring
in their books. We shd. therefore be seen to be anticipatg Parlt.’s
decision and cd. accept no amendments.
Decn. on contn. wd. be needed by mid. Aug., in order to print stamps. 3
months to print and 1 month to distribute. 27 different
denominations.
P.M. Better prs. have 2nd. Rdg. in Oct.
R.A.B. But amendment wd. be at Cttee. Stage.
P.T. Also means that increased benefits are paid before increased contribns.
are collected.
M. Why not try to supplement Stationery Office resources (stamps) by
private printing firms.
Agreed : resume discussion at Cab. next week.
6. Commonwealth Economic Development. [Exit B.C.
P.T. Have seen Party : they won’t press for much larger investment.
Agreed : Present to Parlt., with improved peroration, on
Tues. of next week.
7. Anglo-Canadian Trade.
No note taken.
8. Cotton.
168
P.T. One day restriction will have to be imposed – not only for grey cloth
but for gloves and other industries as they grow up in countries
which have a much lower standard of living.
On grey cloth, shd. the mission go out again? If H. Kong would come
into line, the other 2 countries wd. make a bargain.
P.M. Disturbing to Lancs. if 2 indep. countries are willing to put a limit to
find that a colony won’t come into line.
A.L.B. But if anyone else did this to H Kong we shd. have to object on their
behalf in G.A.T.T.
P.M. But it wd. be voluntary agreemt. by industries.
A.L.B. And H. Kong wd. not make a voluntary agreemt. If we imposed q.t. in
H. Kong, we cdn’t deny it to W. Indies v. U.S.
D.E. Almost all other parts of Comm. restricts imports fr. H Kong. We
don’t seek authy. to impose q.t. at present : only to warn H. Kong
industry tht. they must make voluntary agreemt. for fear of
worse. Worse being growth of B. opinion wh. wd. compel q.t.
eventually.
H.A.(2) We shan’t be able for long to m’tain free entry for Col. manufactured
goods. H. Kong obduracy will hasten that day.
M.(1) Wd. it not be enough to offer to Lancs. tht. we wd. police a vol.
agreemt. if it cd. be reached.
P.M. {Do (1). If H. Kong Govt. seeks advice, tell them (2).
{D.E. to see Govr. on those lines.
