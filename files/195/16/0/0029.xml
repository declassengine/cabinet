C.C. 38 (57) 6th May, 1957

1. Parliament. [Enter A.N., E.H.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
Thursday : Supply Day : likely to be disarmament or Suez.
2. Export of Cattle.
H.A. Criticism can be met if journey on other side of channel is a short one.
We cd. extend limit, if necessary, from 40 kilometres to 80.
Limit of value, applied to horses, was designed to stop the traffic
altogether.
Want liberty to revise statement.
Intend to consult with Govts. concerned.
A.N. Consultn. is necessary. In France, no slaughter-houses n. of Paris. In
Holland Amsterdam is more than 40 Kil.
D.E. Awkward to invite f. countries to police our export condns. Need we
do it.
P.T. Important thing is to discuss. Wd. sooner do that before saying too
precisely what we mean to do.
R.A.B. I agree. Report concerned only with condns. on this side. The
humanitarians will want to be assured re condns. on the other side
– for which we need to have had discussions.
P.M. We can’t control what happens on the other side. Wd. it not be best to
have discns. thro’ O.E.E.C.?
H.A. No quick progress there. Wd. prefer direct discussions with 4 countries
concerned.
{ In light of this talk, prs. better to say only that we will discuss with the
x { other Govts. concerned.
P.M. { We cd. add that we accept recommns. of Cttee. so far as they concern
{ condns. in U.K. Or, rather, let that precede the other part of the
statement.
Agreed – as at x/.

3. Commercial Policy : Overseas Territories.
P.T. Three courses were open i) exclude all ii) include African territories
only or iii) try plan J. We concluded in favour of i). This is what
officials recommend now – see para. 11.
A.L.B. Customs Union. Effects on Colonies will be serious. Favour highlevel
approach to Six Powers on risks. Cocoa and coffee, in
particular. We cd. bargain with them – Germany and prs. Benelux
might be open to pressure because fear of exclusion from Br.
Colonial markets.
Free Trade Area. All Colonies, with 2 exceptns., favour exclusion.
Kenya and Hong Kong wd. wish to be included. Kenya because
they will have large surplus of agric. products. H.Kong, as
manufacturg. centre, asks us not to join unless they can be
included. We shall have to over-ride their views, but they will
need v. careful handling. It must be all or none : and balance is
clearly in favour of none.
We need a debate in H/C. in order to make it clear that we are not
abandoning Colonial economic interests.
D.E. Support conclusions in memo.
I wd. play it by saying we must get area constituted first, but
don’t altogether exclude possibility of considering extension later
to particular territories.
H. Doms. support exclusion of Colonies.
P.M. Two ques : i) can we organise Eur. free trade area for manufactd.
goods. This was to be confined to Eur. But, as Fr. overseas
territies. have bn. brght into Customs Union, we cd. leave door
open as D.E. suggests. This is for manufactures and, save for
Hong Kong, no Colony really needs to be included.
ii) Customs Union havg. included Fr. Colonies, must we
not mitigate injury of that to our Colonies? Yes. On lines
recommended. First, keeping tariff low : second, prs. by quotas
reflectg. existg. trade pattern.
P.T. Urge caution on i). Later opting in of Kenya etc., wd. give
opportunities for foreign overseas territories to ask for inclusion.
Memo. approved.
[Enter P.M.G.
4. Nationalised Industries.
M. 7% increased in c/living wd. be involved if power industries increased
prices sufficiently to finance necessary investment.
Electricity prices have bn. advanced. Coal prices have not.
What I contemplate is normal commercial practice.
111
H.W. Ques of principle. Shd. a natd. industry merely cover its costs or shd. it
attempt to cover its depreciation. If Transport attempted second
policy, prices wd. have to go v. high.
M. If second policy is not adopted, Ty. has to cover deficits – on
borrowing.
P.M. First take running costs. We have endeavoured to cover these. £92 M
now needs to be recovered. But this involves no drastic change
of policy.
M. No question – they must cover operating costs.
P.M. Second, shd. they charge enough to finance investment? They mustn’t
show a profit – for it wd. be dissipated by wage claims. Hence
suggn. of new method of accounting.
P.M.G. We show only v. small profit because we charge to commercial cost,
not only operatg. cost, but replacement.
Agreed : Maintain policy of covering operating costs and
authorise the £92 M.
P.M. Tho’ G.P.O. charges replacement to commercial account, Revenue
won’t allow ordinary business to escape tax on reserves.
Govt. will therefore be open to criticism if natd. indies. allowed to take
this course.
P.T. No : for they will be treated in same way as private industry, for tax.
If memo. is not approved, I shall be short of £48 M. on Budget.
I.M. Doubtful about this policy. On wages policy we seek stability, try to
hold prices and have independent Bd. These objectives wd. be
frustrated by policy of increasing prices by natd. industies. – which
wd. be regarded as deliberate Govt. action to increase prices.
This wd. be 2/= a ton on coal.
M. How can you take that line if you agree to covering operating costs.
Replacement of assets is part of operatg. costs. It is by deliberate
Cab. action that coal has bn. prevented from going so far as gas
and electricity have gone in covering re-placement.
P.M. The big money, for Ty., is in gas and electricity.
P.T. The plateau period is ending. Two courses : a) Try to hold it, by
supreme effort. b) Accept need for price increases but relate
them to wage awards. I favour b) because think increases are
inevitable. Case is strong therefore for letting prices in public
sector be self-financing.
112
I.M. I don’t despair of a). C/living index has bn. falling for 3 months. If
you approve this memo. you won’t get T.U.C. co-opn. in our
wage policy or get any stability in wage claims.
H.W. 2/= on coal wd. provoke increase in B.T.C. charges.
R.A.B. Para. 15. Both are inflationary. Economic arguments are in favour of
raising it from consumers. Arguments against are “political” :
incldg. I.M.’s point that these increases will bear most hardly on
“middle classes”.
D.E. Fear this will work thro’ economy to disadvantage of exports. We are
not in posn. to bear increase in export prices.
I conclude : do this because it is right. But pursue disinflation, under
monetary policy.
H.B. If we are off the plateau, I wd. favour doing the £48 M. as well.
H.A. Cd. we miss out coal which makes the big impact.
P.T. Much is to be said for spreading the increase, for coal.
M. Ready, if Cab. wish me, to spread that over 5 years. This wd. mean 6/6
on coal.
Accept this basis in principle: but spread the increase, for
coal, over 5 years.
[Exit P.M.G.
5. Malta.
A.L.B. Defence policy will bring gt. hardship to Malta.
On constitutional issue : dyarchy wd. lose us all our friends in Malta.
Our integration proposals wd. have an appeal to people of Malta.
Or, we cd, try a 5 year trial period. Wd. like authy. to put last 2
alternatives to Mintoff.
R.A.B. Shd. we be bound to have Commn. under second?
A.L.B. No.
R.A.B. Ready to promote legn. to make Malta part of the B. Isles.
P.T. Para. 7. “new round of negotns.” He will take this as starting point.
A.L.B. I will make it clear this is last word.
P.M. Put it as our answer. No more to come but elucidation.
113
P.T. Also make it clear tht. if he runs into deficit on Budget we don’t carry
that in addn. to the £6 M.
D.S. Can’t be sense i) to cut down on defence projects wh. are valuable but
put defence money into Malta which we don’t need to spend. ii) to
put naval work into Malta at expense of U.K. naval dockyards.
H. That underlines the case for last alternatives vice last but one.
E.H. Opinion in Tory Party is hardening v. integration. [Exit D.S.
H. Better therefore to offer last alternative, tho’ saying that offer of
integration still stands.
P.M. Final agreement to be by exchange of letters text of which shd. be
approved by Malta Cttee.
6. Nigeria.
A.L.B. Conference, p’poned from last autumn, will open next week. Will
submit memo. for Cabinet.
7. Industrial Disputes.
I.M. Terms – for 2 sides of industries – will take some weeks.
Do we go fwd. at once on suggn. of a Board. Main mtg. shd. be at No.
10. But can I m’while see what reactions of T.U.C. might be?
P.M. Let us have a memo. for discussion by Cab. on Friday.
8. Suez Canal.
P.T. Message from Basle. E. seems likely to accept No.3 Account provided
we are willing immediately thereafter to discuss future of No.1
Account and related ques.
P.M. This cd. be accepted.
