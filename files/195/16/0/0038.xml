C.C. 47(57). 24th June, 1957. 3 p.m.

1. Public Service: Salaries.
Note not taken. [Exit A.L.B.
2. Disarmament.
Terms of P.M.'s message to President approved.
3. Housing Policy : Manchester.
Note not taken.
4. Admiral Hughes-Hallett : Pension. [Enter C.S., Att.G.
P.T. Not a v. good case. P.A.C. cd. go into this : we must be able to justify
the settlement.
Att.G. His chances of success in the suit are not more than 50%. I don't think
it necessary to go above 50&#37; in settling. viz., &#163;2.000.
We shd. not admit any liability. He cd. easily have informed himself
of the truth.
Agreed : Settle at &#163;2.000 : each side to pay own costs.
[Exit Att.G.
5. U.S. Naval Visit.
P.M. If Nautilus comes into P'smouth, U.S. will exploit the fact that our
atomic stations are sited 5 miles away from towns : proving that
our re-actors are more dangerous than theirs. Purely a sales
question.
Suggest we either p'pone visit - or let her go to Milford Haven or
Invergordon.
C.S. Agreemt. on atomic marine propulsion was reached, despite A.E.C., by
help of U.S. Navy.
Difference betwn. static re-actor and visiting ship, qua risk.
If our guest, it shd. go to naval port. Invergordon will be shut by
end/July. M. Haven is not naval port.
If P'smouth is ruled out, cd. she go to Portland.
P.M. Ask Plowden wtr he wd. be content with Portland. [Exit C.S.
