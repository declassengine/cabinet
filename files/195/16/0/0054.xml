C.C. 72 (57) 8th October, 1957

1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter E.H.
S.Ll. Syria – congealing outwardly in their favour. Must continue co-opn.
with U.S.
Egypt – shall have to define our attitude on small payments.
Soviet Union. Treat the satellite as part if I.G. Year : congrats. on
success shd. be our line.
P.M. We are compelled, at present, twds containment policy twds Syria –
for lack, at present, of better.
Egypt : are we to resume trade/finance relns. : or to m’tain economic
cold war – on basis of dividing M/E. and driving Nasser further
twds Soviet? For the moment, we can only feel our way in Rome
talks. Thereafter, we need a joint policy with U.S.
S.Ll. Leads on to another ques. Are we to face econ. war with R. in M/E. –
e.g. Sudan cotton : Lebanese apples. Are we to put any cash into
it? Will U.S. pay their share?
P.M. World review, if we cd. make it, wd. prob. indicate a switch of effort
and cash from NATO to M/E. Mght get U.K./U.S. w. party on
that.
Hail. Direct use of Deutchsmarks for purchase e.g. of Lebanese apples?
S.Ll. G. are willing to take a share in that one.
2. Commercial Policy. [Enter Perth : Alport
R.M. Mtg. in Paris next week, with P.T. in chair – overture to detailed
negotns. Our plan differs fr. that of Six – i) theirs is method of
econ. and pol. integration : ii) theirs reflects detailed balance of
interests of each.
Talks with Eur. Govts. W’in the Six, German views co-incide v. much
with our own : tho’ F.O. don’t want to upset Fr. Dutch and
Belgians want us in somethg. to offset G. dominance w’in Six.
Italy : pol. pressures in favour of f.t. area : anxious for
compromise. France will be diffy. : they will exact large price and
will hang on to what they have gained in Rome Treaty. The
others will press them.
Outside the Six – Scandinavians are much of our view. Denmark is in
sp. diffy. and wd. have to join Six unless they cd. get some protn.
under a f. t. area.
Outstanding basic ques – agriculture, origins and overseas territories.
Agriculture. No one thinks f. t. in agric. is practicable. Our line
therefore will simultaneous discussion of means of further
198
internatl. reguln. of agric. exports etc., Believe this will be
accepted.
Origins. V. diff. problem, but crucial.
Overseas Territories. We oppose inclusion. Cdn’t admit dependent
w’out independent. Shall get some support fr. G. and Benelux.
G.A.T.T. Believe Europeans will prove tht. Treaty of Rome is
consistent. But opposn. likely from India and Afro.Asians. Diffies.
later over their agricultural practice, wh. will prob. need a waiver.
Europeans, if faced with choice betwn. Rome Treaty and G.A.T.T., wd.
chose former. Techn. diffies. are immense, but genl. wish to see f.
t. area come to birth.
D.E. Diff. approach of G. and Fr. Latter see Six as method of extending
system of high protn. for franc. Former favour liberal
commercial policies.
The institns. of the Six are such as to give G. leadership in Europe. But
strains w’in the Six will grow : their attitude (esp. G. and F.) is not
the same. cf. also Italy, wh. is producer of raw materials,
whereas G. and Dutch don’t : former, with Fr. will seek high tariffs
on imports of raw materials, while latter will want opposite. If
these diffces. develop, we may have chance of U.K. leadership if
we can develop the institns. in the f. t. area. Top body of that cd.
be better instrument than top body of Six.
G.A.T.T. Commonw. countries are nervous of competition of Six by
e.g. bulk buying from their own dependent territories. We can
play it long avoiding final decns. until it is known what use Six
will make of their Treaty provisions. We must have U.S. with us
if we are to succeed. Hope we can press Dillon to attend
G.A.T.T. mtg. We are agreeing our line with Commw. offls :
when we have it agreed, we shall tell U.S.
P. Satisfied with proposed line of action viz., keep colonies out of f. t.
area if other overseas territories are excluded. Content also with
proposals on agriculture provided some mitigation can be secured
for colonies. But we are anxious.
Alport. Indep. Comm. countries are increasingly apprehensive of potential use
of Rome Treaty provns. Austr. may take lead in critical review at
G.A.T.T. Mtg.
Annex to C. 219. concerns us : if it’s logical consequence of U.K.
attitude Para. 9 – consultn. with Doms. – underestimates diffies.
we shd. have with them if we had to weaken on exclusion of
agric.
H.A. Agree tht. proposed approach on agric. is only practicable one. But
must insist – i) no free trade in agric. ii) can’t reduce our output
below present level iii) must retain control of our agric. policy.
Hope tht., with attention to timing, we may hope to find a way
thro’ the diffies – which are v. great.
199
P.T. Don’t allow technical diffies. to cast us down. Contrast the prize we are
running for – opening Eur. market to our manufactures. Not
inconsistent with continuing Comm. co-operation. Mont
Tremblant Confce. was convinced of that.
Techn. diffies. are so great tht. we shall only get thro’ them if political
advantages of united Europe is kept prominently in mind.
GATT. It is mainly agric. side wh. requires waiver. The rest cd. be
accommodated.
Doms. Right line is to have constant and full consultns.
Hail. From Party angle, don’t play it as opposed to Commw. co-operation.
And play up political advantages – anti-communist.
Will Common Market work w’out a f. t. area? Or has it w’in itself
seeds of its own destruction. If so, affects price we shd. pay for f.
t. area.
R.M. Common Market is fundamental to policy of all countries of Six and
they are determined to make it work.
M. Fear pressure to make us join in managemt. of Eur. institns.
x/ Negotns. will be long. Party shd. be warned v. expectg. quick results.
H.W. The institutions of Common Market, and their bureaucracy, will become
powerful vested interest – in favour of continuance and success.
D.S. Gain achieved at Mont Tremblant.
Ultimately, this will be pol. decision – need to build strong Europe.
Shall therefore need consultns. on that level, as well as R.M.’s
economic level.
P.M. Approve conduct of negotiations on basis proposed.
Endorse x/. But, on large issues, we must try to lift the argument
above technical level. Europe and Commw. are not in conflict
over pol. aim of bldg bulwark of prosperity v. Communist
encroachment. Only on this basis will irritations of econ.
concessions be accepted.
We mustn’t underestimate importance wh. Europeans attach to
institutions. Must make those of f. t. area no less impressive than
those of Six – for it is there that we must exercise our influence.
Will a “statute” of agriculture be understood by Br. people. Charter
wd. be preferable.
[Exit P. and E.H.
3. E/West Trade : Copper Wire.
P.M. Cd. we not make interim offer to restrict our exports over next year to
not much more than what we exported in 2nd. half of ’56 and 1st.
half of ’57.
S.Ll. Wd. like to get back to 50.000 t. a year. Express that in a time scale.
200
D.E. We are being asked for another 10,000 t. W.Germany are offering
50.000. We shall lose the trade if we hang back our firms.
I wd. prefer a level of 65.000 t., which wd. be covered by P.M.’s
formula.
P.T. x/ Press U.S. to review strategic basis of the controls.
P.M. Ask for x/ : and offer to limit our sales m’while to a figure of 30,000 t.
of licences for next 6 months., i.e. same as in 1st. half of last year.
4. Civil Aviation : Independent Airlines.
H.W. As in memo.
S.Ll. Timing. If we give it to these, what of others – e.g. Federation Line.
Alp. Fedn. Govt. wd. follow our advice.
P.M. Defer decn. for 2 wks. – to judge progress of Rome talks. Agreed.
[Exit Alport.
