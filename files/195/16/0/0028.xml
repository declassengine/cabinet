C.C. 37 (57) 2nd May, 1957

1. Disarmament. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Have authd. submn. of short memo. to Cttee. on limitn. of tests. Agreed
with F.O. and M/Def. and with Stassen.
Read it.
Worth tabling something. This is not dangerous.
This is private meeting – we cd., however, leak it at appropriate
moment.
E.H. Debate in week after next – will be demanded by Opposition.
P.M. Cd. be leaked before then.
H. Will we gain anything by final para. on restraint?
P.M. Can’t say less than at B/muda.
Agreed. Delete para. 4 (not a proposal) but put it orally.
2. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
3. Channel Tunnel.
H.W. Must consider cross-channel commns. in light of a Europ. free trade
area. E.P.C. favoured more interdepartmental consn. before
consultg. French. Since then much public interest has bn.
aroused. In France, Suez Canal Co. sees it as alternative
investment. American Co. in the field. We must move fast, in
case Fr. Govt. give facilities for a survey.
B.T.C. view is in favour. Mght cost £200 M. for rail tunnel only. But
we mght get dollars for it.
A.L.B. Wd. sooner spend that amount of money on roads – or on improving
ports.
P.T. Agree we must look at it seriously. But doubt if it’s wise to say
anything in public yet.
H.W. French Co. has firm concession to build. Br. Co. think they can raise
the money in U.S.
D.E. Ferry Services to Rhine mght be more profitable.
106
D.S. No serious mil. objns. – tho’ haven’t consulted C.O.S.
P.M. i) Study this – incldg. alternative means of improving cross-channel
transport.
ii) Do we associate ourselves with a survey? Interim report on that
point from interdepl. Cttee.
iii) Study also wtr Suez Canal Co. cd. (under Articles of Assocn.)
transfer its assets to this enterprise. Mght suit us better to see Co.
go into liquidation. L.O.’s cd. give an opinion on this.
Ty. to study (iii) separately. Cd. we buy more shares to get
controlling interest?
iv) M’while, no public statement to be volunteered.
4. Commercial Policy .
P.T. C (57) 106. Free Trade Area.
Powerful forces in Eur. wh. favour common market w’out free trade
area. A high-tariff bloc. All Dpts. agree tht. this wd. damage our
interests v. seriously. Genl. talks are therefore going v. slow.
Treaty of Rome is likely to be ratified in July by France and then
Germany.
Our aim : get the 6 commd. to free trade area at time when they ratify.
Maurice Faure comg. to Ldn. on Mon. Shall probe French
position.
P.M. going to Bonn on Tues. He will try to get Adenauer to say tht.
common market shd. be set in a wider free trade area.
Thereafter, we may have to consult our Amb. in Europe – to scotch
idea tht. we are trying to wreck common market. Also discuss
with Scandinavians.
D.E. Treaty of Rome – political dynamism is important factor : they want
united Europe and regard our efforts as putting Atlantic water into
their Europn. wine. They envisage a “third force” group.
Economically they can build up somethg. effective. That is v.
serious threat to us. Our special relation with U.S. mght soon go,
if U.S. saw real power in Europe rested with the Six, led by
Germany.
cf. the way in which they rejected our Grand Design project. They
don’t want the Atlantic addn.
Critical that we shd. take a new initiative showg. tht. we have
something to contribute.
R.A.B. Para. g. May we not have to use more definite language with Faure and
Adenauer – e.g. tht. we may be forced to adopt a much less
liberal trade policy.
Agriculture. Difficult pol. posn. Fear Europ. will ask for agric.
concessions. Tories in H.C. won’t tolerate any. Don’t
understand para 17. Wd. welcome an explanation.
107
French intentn. is to ratify and reduce tariffs 12 mos. later. We shd. press
for simultaneous redn.
P.T. Delay cd. work to our advantage. It wd. be necessary if we are to
marry free trade area with common market……..
D.S. We face complete collapse of our European policy. We were anxious
to lead Europe. Now we are discussing how we defend ourselves
economically against them. Can we really face that? We may
rather have to contemplate going further in. Cd. we have memo
on consequences of these alternatives?
R.A.B. Cd. F.O. submit memo. on extent to which political assocn. cd. be
carried.
H.W. Believe Germany is the key – they cd. be persuaded to see advantages
to them of free trade area.
I.M. So do I.
H. Cd. we see a memo. showing what we cd. safely offer by way of
concessions to get agreement to a free trade area.
P.M. We missed the bus at end of war.
Conflict w’in Eur. movement. Old hostility to U.K. Much rested
on 3 men – Adenauer, Schuman and de Gasperi – born w’in 20
miles : the central Eur. idea. On econ. side, ambition to forge
something wh. wd. give same standard/living as in U.S.
For us, no hope now of Imperial economic unity. That bus was missed
in 1906. Too late now.
To Adenauer I wd. be frank. He must face pol. consequences of limitg
it to the Six. It will disrupt N.A.T.O. Is he sure tht. best protn. v.
R. is united Europe (Six only).
Study i) what concessions we cd. make on common
investment etc., to prove our good faith.
ii) to what extent cd. we agree to others (outside the
Six) makg. agric. arrangemts – consistently
with our obligns. to our own producers and to
Commonwealth.
iii) what defence we cd. put up, if common market
is organised without free trade area – incldg
a) possibility of sabotaging it; b) means of
living in spite of it.
M. Consider also our assocn. with Schuman plan.
D.E. Shd. we not offer to be represented by a Minister in some of their
institutions?
P.M. iv) Study rather what is to be board of management of free trade area.
108
Agreed.
C (57) 107 – to be discussed at a later meeting.
