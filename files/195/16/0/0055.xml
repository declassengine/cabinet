C.C. 73 (57) 15th October, 1957

1. Syria. [Enter E.H., O.G.
O.G. Division of opinion among Arab States – some believe moderates will
emerge in Syria. M’while, Jordan and Lebanon are in danger.
Discussing with U.S. practical means of giving effect to a policy
of “containment plus”.
P.M. Sov. Govt. have written to Socialist Parties of NATO countries
accusing Govts. of plotting preventive war. Likely to be
published to-morrow. I deduce from this that it may be
preliminary to a R. coup in some other Arab country. S.Ll. will
be able to discuss with F.D.
Move of E. troops to Syria : may be demonstration : may lead to R. not
putting troops in. But dangerous.
R. may however ask for 3 Power Conference on M/E.
O.G. But that mght hinder their line of oppn. to Israel.
[Enter A.J., Alport
2. Civil Aviation : Britannia Aircraft.
H.W. Suggest Ministers previously asked to go into this shd. study it further
and report to Cab. V. urgent to cure defects. Mtg. again this p.m.
A.J. Don’t wholly agree. Primary requiremt. is good will by B.O.A.C.
Bristols were wrong in sending to Miami an aircraft known to be
defective : they are now however appointg. Slattery. But BOAC
have violently repudiated their earlier sponsorship of Britannia :
that attitude can’t be right. This aircraft has a future : we can’t
yet plumb the problems of jet air-liners. Suggest we must bring
BOAC round : make them fulful their pledge to promote sales to
3rd. parties.
P.M. Conflict of interests? – or personalities?
H.W. Can’t get it right merely by askg. world to have faith in it.
P.M. Let us revert to examination by Ministerial Cttee.
But a) can’t allow Britannia to fail.
b) Bristol’s can’t be allowed to go bust.
c) no doctrinaire preconceptions shd. stand in the way.
x| Cttee. shd. therefore concentrate on practical means of salvaging this.
| Add M/L. to Cttee. : and ask M/Power to preside.
P.T. Don’t assume, as granted, that we must do a) and b) at any cost. Must
view it objectively.
202
A.J. Nor shd. they assume tht. BOAC shd. be rescued at any cost.
Hail. Is all dependent on Proteus engine? If so, I have no faith in it.
P.T. Financial implications need v. detailed examination.
D.S. I had to save de Havillands, after Comet disaster. We must recognise
tht. it wd. be national disaster if Britannia collapsed.
M’while B.O.A.C. shd. be stopped from black-guarding Britannia.
M. V. useful mtg, with M/S., at which all aspects were deployed. We shd.
continue with this study. Agreed as at x/.
3. Economic Situation. [Exit Alport and A.J.
[Enter D.W.S.
P.T. As in C. 230.
We are in vulnerable position. Must show tht. we intend to carry
through the policies we have declared. We are being watched v.
carefully on this.
H.B. a. What is present position?
b. What is real form on 5 (ii)?
P.T. b. Wd. prefer to put in further memo. on 5 (ii).
a. Reserves static, since my pre-Washington Statement. Rate has
improved. But some net reduction in Oct. inevitable because of
E.P.U. carry-over.
D.E. This liability on s.a. balances reduced by run-down, we have borrowed
elsewhere. We ought not therefore be investing anything abroad,
and shd. instead borrow capital from abroad.
P.T. We looked at both those possibilities and found v. gt. diffies. in each.
D.E. But can we risk continuing private investment abroad, even w’in
sterling area : for it can be forwarded on e.g. thro’ S. Africa or
Kuwait gap.
P.M. These are next stages. Memo. gives state of battle on ground on wh.
we chose to fight it. We must carry on that fight. The policies
are sound in themselves – even tho’ they may not suffice to cure
our external difficulties.
P.T. Not too despondent about external, if we can get our internal economy
straight. Other Fin. Ministers are showg. greater realism about s.
balances etc.,
D.S. Can we have memo. on strategy for fighting inflation?
203
P.M. Clear enough – i) hold back investment ii) restrict Bank advances iii) ?
P.T. Coupled with wage policy.
4. National Health Services : Wage Negotiations.
P.T. Crux is on wages. Diff sitn. on N.H.S. Award of 3% given by
management side of Whitley, despite clear advice to contrary by
Minister. We must decline to give effect to this.
D.W.S. V. diff. situation.
Tho’ I asked Chairman not to make this offer because econ. situation,
the award is not excessive – it is in line with awards already
made to C. Service, electricity etc., i.e. final step in last round.
Cd. refuse it only as first move in a coherent policy : cdn’t be
defended on its own.
Parallel with rlways. If B.T.C. refuse and it goes to arbitration – are we
to reject recommdn. for increase. If not, a refusal here wd. be
seen to have bn. unjustified. My case can’t go to arbitn. because
no issue between the parties.
Refusal wd. imply policy of no increases at all, even after arbitration.
I.M. V. important decn. Neden advises against P.T. I don’t agree with that.
But risk tht. Whitley Council may resign – a serious blow to
collective bargaining. Can’t now blame composn. for we cd.
have altered it.
Policy : make no offer or lowest practicable : be taken to arbitn. and
accept result : but make no fresh money available.
Here we can’t go to arbitn. because no issue betwn. parties.
Suggest therefore we offer to look again at this claim in Jan., when it
will be 12 mos. since last increase granted. C/living will have
risen m’while : discourages too frequent applns.
D.W.S. a. Approval wd. then be retrospective to 1/10.
b. How cd. they be prevented fr. submittg. further claim?
I.M. a. Don’t bind yourself on that. b. Cdn’t be stopped : but it wd. be
frivolous.
J.M. Noel Hall has submitted report on structure. Cd. delay be justified on
that a/c?
D.W.S. No.
M. I.M.’s alternative is worth trying. Buys time, durg. wh. we can see
what happens on other fronts.
204
H.W. I.M.’s plan wd. help me with rlways. Refusal wd. be read as denial of
arbitn.
H.B. Procedure is fundamentally unsound. Must change it.
Ch.H. Govt. is responsible for payment. Must be made plain at outset that
Govt. won’t pay. This, for Govt., is the outset. Qua presentation,
may be better to give plain negative.
P.T. Don’t want, by I.M.’s formula, to give countenance to annual wage
increases.
Can we create an arbitral issue.
P.M. Let us first have general memo. on Govts’s direct employees as a
whole – to see this v. background of genl posn. For Cab. –
preferably on Friday at 11. a.m. Consider wtr there can be a
general statement – to support particular action of M/H. (cf.
article in Fin. Times).
H.B. Cover also l.a. staffs : over wh. we have no control.
P.M. And those over whom Govt. have indirect control. (nationalised
industries).
5. Investment – Education.
G.Ll. Cuts shd. be related to numbers. First alternative : levelling off – on
basis of equality with investment as a whole. Second : go further
but protect tech. educn. and schools for bulge (£11 M).
