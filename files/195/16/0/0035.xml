C.C. 44(57). 4th June, 1957.

1. Commonwealth Economic Development. [Enter E.H., O.G.
P.M. Reported results of discn. with Ministers most concerned.
P.T. Conflict : desire to do more : impossibility of investing a deficit. Line
at P.M.M. All countries have vast p’mmes : size of U.K.
investment already at 1% of nat. G.N.P. : income : expansion
possible only by widening our trading base – e.g. free trade area.
Make it clear to them and to our Party that we can’t conjure up
resources which don’t exist.
H. Comm. links are weakening – Crown, defence etc., This shd. be a
substitute. But Doms. reluctant to play.
Draft of statement (for PMM and Wh. Paper) shd. be ready by 14/6.
A.L.B. Two points :-
a) Exchequer loans mght. not discourage lending on market. Wd.
remove fear that promoters wd. be left with stock unsold. But
ready to accept assurances. Tho’ I wd. like to have had the Loans
Bill. But I am prepd. to wait and see. Tho’ I must be free to tell
Govts. to go ahead with approved schemes, despite uncertainty re
availability of money.
P.T. Accept that.
P.M. i) We do much more than is supposed. We must present it
effectively.
ii) Build up our contribn. in expertise.
iii) Leave it to Ty. and Bank to settle methods of financing. Use all
resources of C.O.I. to get due publicity for (i). Agreed.
P.T. Will cosider wtr N. Savings cd. be boosted with specific probject
appeals.
2. Public Service Salaries.
P.M. Despite political risks, we must grasp this nettle – this summer is as
good a time as any other.
R.A.B. We must do this.
M.P. salaries : “irrespective of their actual expenses” is vital because
Labour Members cdn’t prove expenses as high as £750.
Leader of Opposn. : suggest I ascertain his wishes.
P.M. Remuneration of M.P.’s. Figure shd. be £1750. If it is represented as
“allowance” public will assume it is tax-free, whatever we say to
134
the contrary. Wd. it be better to raise salary to £1750? But that
wd. be regarded, by workers, as a large percentage wage
increase.
Cd. we call it “Parly. allowance”. Explaining that average cost of
carrying out constituency duties is £700-£750. Our aim therefore
is to see that M.P. gets his £1.000 as remuneration.
I.M. Say : basic salary is £1.000. Amount to be added on a/c of
constituency duties is £750. Govt. have therefore decided to
make the remuneration £1750. The whole of this will be liable to
tax. Don’t therefore call it an “expense allowance”.
Ministers’ Salaries.
After discussion, agreed : Add £1.000 to Ministers over £5.000
Add £1250 .. .. under ..
Give the £750 to all.
Draft statement : omit total cost : para. 11.
Officers of the House.
Speaker : give him the sum of £750. He is still a Member. Ask
him.
Hail. More logical, qua status, to raise his salary to £6.000 – of which
£4.000 is free of tax.
Para 4 of Annex A. Raise by £1250.
Para. 5. Add £1.000 and the £750, if he wants it. Ask him.
Compensation for Injury. Agreed. But consider announcing at
same time a difft. method of covering M.P.’s on journeys
undertaken for H/C. or Govt.
Procedure : Inform leaders of 2 Parties and Cl. Davies as Chairman of
Select Cttee.
Consult Speaker and Leader of Oppn. on own salaries.
P.M. to see Executive of 1922.
Tell Gaitskell on Thurs. after re-assembly we are going ahead (no
details). Similar warning to Party on same day. Tell other
Leaders and consult H.G. on his salary late on followg. Monday.
Announce Tuesday.
3. Dollar Expenditure: Tourism.
P.T. The £100 travel allowance to be available in dollar area. Dollar cost is
incalculable but negligible.
Remove at same time some existg. quotas.
Hail. May we have corresponding statement in H/Lds? Agreed.
A.L.B. Reserve my position on details of list.
135
Prepd. to give way on hard-wood.
But want to get all replies fr. Colonies on chemicals and foodstuffs.
P.M. On what principle?
D.E. Industrial raw materials.
P.M. Let us settle the travel. But hold over the materials for further scrutiny.
And make it clear that we are doing nothg. that doesn’t benefit
our capacity to export.
