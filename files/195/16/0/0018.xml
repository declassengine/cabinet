C.C. 19(57). 14th March, 1957.

1. Farm Prices. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Techn. consns. exhaustively discussed. What remains is a pol.
decision.
i) We can have imposed settlement at cost of £13 M. to Exchquer :
with no advance on milk.
ii) Or settlement at £14¼ M., with ¼d. increase on milk, wh. wd.be
“agreed”.
Of these, i) is consistent with genl. attitude of Govt. – to be firm in
doing what is practical and right. Problem of excessive prodn. of
milk is well known. In favour of ii), main argument is
confidence of farmers : diffy. of Bill (timing) : milk at ¼d. wd. be
“only a little one”: split on only £1¼ M. and ¼d. will seem
niggardly. Genl. pol. diffy. of oppn. by N.F.U.’s.
Problem : which course is the more likely to enhance our pol. strength.
My feeling on whole : I shd. be relieved if sound case cd. be made to
support agreed settlement. But don’t want it on unsound basis.
D.S. Agreement mght be represented as not weak if M/Ag. cd. at same time
make it clear tht. milk prodn. must be curtailed. Avoid too rapid
a change.
K. Can’t ignore pol. diffies. Don’t want to sacrifice farmers’ good will on
so narrow a point. Wd. give us gt. diffies. among Tories in H/C. –
a v. solid section wh. we shd. need if other trouble comes.
P.T. We exist as a Govt. on what country expects us to do. They believe we
will exercise real restraint over expend’re. Risk of incentive
Budget wd. be greatly increased if it were suspected tht. we were
saying yes when we ought to say no. Credit restrictn. is
beginning to weaken. ¼d. on milk is bound to be seen as a weak
and wrong decision.
A.L.B. True : but weakening in Tory Party wd. be a graver embarrassment to
Ch/Exch.
D.E. Support P.T. If we are to change character and direction of Govt.,
consistency is most important.
This is symbolic amount. Makes it worse. Symbolic of concession.
M. Strong course wd. have bn. £8 M. imposed. When you come to £13 M.
wiser course is to get agreement.
L.P. Despite Comm. objns., I am driven to same concln. Gap is too small to
warrant major row.
74
I.M. Agree with M.’s summary. Industrial storms ahead require united
Party.
P.T. Diffy. is that we shall be saying ‘yes’ when even farmers know we shd.
say ‘no’.
H.A. But we shd. be recouping only ¼d. out of 2½d. increase in costs.
Farmers will say : last year £25 M. imposed. This year £14¼ M.
agreed. On roughly same increase of costs. This will be
regarded as tough.
Prodn. and efficiency are increasing – despite shrinking labour force.
Our original plan wd. have involved a minus for small farmers. Can’t
pretend it’s fair to them unless N.F.U.’s accept.
Can’t hope to increase efficiency if we lose farmers’ good will.
R.A.B. P.T. may be introducg. incentive Budget. Don’t w’draw incentive fr.
farmers. M/Ag. can help in presentn. This is not as weak as P.T.
suggests. Increased cost 2½d. : ¼d. is not generous.
S.Ll. Pol. balance is in favour of agreed settlement.
H.W. Wd. help if M/Ag. cd. present it (in Wh. Paper) as tough and make it
clear tht. milk prodn. must be run down.
P.T. i) no further concession to Turner.
ii) machinery for negotn. in future. Suggest enquiry in wh. neither Ty.
nor M/Ag. are concerned : 3 Heads of Dpts.
Agreed : Seen agreed settlement of £14¼ m. [Exit ALB., L.P.,
Proceed as at i) and ii) above. K, RAB. D.E
2. Industrial Disputes.
I.M. Govt. attitude has had a good Press.
Unions : divided leaders – in attitude. Some hoping worst mayn’t
happen. Others (Communists) determined to bring chaos in.
Cousins is resolved to spread it, to get quick victory, to
something like a general strike.
Employers are likely to accept, reluctantly, idea of arbitration.
Possibilities : i) unilateral award by Evershed. Won’t run.
ii) Mght offer arbitn. to engineering – if strike is called
there – and expect award to be extended to ship-bldg.
Wd. be wrong to urge employers to make a cash offer. But shd. offer
to see both sides – in last effort to urge arbitn.
Rlway settlement will be 3%. NUR are bound to reject that. Hope
B.R. will renew offer of 3½%.
M. Wd. be useful if attentn. cd. be diverted from shipbldg. to engineering.
Support suggn. on (ii).
75
H.W. B.R. won’t wish to seem to be selling the employers’ pass.
Further discn. not noted.
3. Israel.
S.Ll. W’ton Tel. 626-8.
Have spoken to Jebb, who will enquire.
