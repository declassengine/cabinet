C.C. 26(57). 28th March, 1957.

[Enter 3 Serv. Min., A.J., E.H. and 4 C.O.S.
1. Defence White Paper.
P.M. Balance in presentation.
S.Ll. Two main points :
i) If we make too sharp a break with our own past, we shall be in
pol. diffies. Wd. prefer a difft. introdn.
ii) Force reductions and N.S. Para. 51.
D.S. See revised version of §§ 50-53.
S.Ll. Para. 52 of revise will lose us G. support costs and cause alarm in
N.A.T.O.
D.S. But you can’t present the case w’out saying you are going over to
regular Forces and can’t say that w’out people knowing what the
figure will be.
P.M. Cd. you deal only with coming fin. year? Workg. twds regular forces :
don’t know how long it will take : but in this year shall reduce by
x. Separate size from method of recruitment.
S.Ll. Give this year’s figure as decision : but further plans as project on
which we shall consult with Allies.
I.M. Won’t be able to avoid admittg. target of 375.000 in debate, because of
N.S. argument.
D.S. Need for Services to work to a definite plan over period of years.
P.T. This policy hasn’t been costed.
S.Ll. Para. 5. About ½ of our man-power and ⅔rds of our exp’re on r and d. is
for defence. Agreed.
P.T. Para. 6. “To be strong we must be solvent.”
P.M. Add at end of para 5
[P.T.] All these strains must be taken into a/c in achieving proper balance.
Then we cd. omit para. 6. A single sentence.
S.Ll. Para 10. Comments not noted. ? as amended in text.
Prefer phrase of last year : “to deal with outbreaks of limited war if
they occur” Agreed : as in ms. in text.
P.M. Para 12. As in text.
84
P.T. Para. 14. Is it safe to say 1st. sentence?
D.S. W’out it, no justificn. for redn. in F. Command.
P.M. “… there is to-day no means of giving adequate protn. to whole
country v. attack by nuclear weapons.”
S.Ll. Para. 17. omit words deleted in ms.
D.S. Inserted because Oppn. were committed to it.
Agreed : “there is wide agreement…”.
Para 17. While compreh. disarm. remains foremost objective of Br.
Agreed for. policy, pending [ ].
P.T. Para. 18. Can’t afford bombers and rockets. Amended as shown in text.
P.M. Para 20. It is poss. that g.m. defence may be developed v. b. rocket,
* and we are not neglecting this possibility in our research in
collaborn. with U.S.
R.A.B. Para 21. “for this and for other emergencies a review is being made of
stock-piling policy.”
P.M. Not in W.P. – reserve for debate.
S.Ll. Re-draft of para. 25.
D.S. Met by 6th. draft.
P.T. Assume rocket artillery refers only to Corporal.
D.S. Yes.
S.Ll. Para. 30. Omit “all” British forces in the M/E. As in ms. in text.
P.M. Para. 40. Make plans for using charter companies. Memo. to be
* submitted on this.
S.Ll. Delete 41.
S. Add reference to R. Marines. Agreed. Paras 43 – 45.
P.T. Para. 44. cf. para. 27 : role in major war is uncertain. Doubt if we shd.
go into tactical nuclear. Cost of sea-slug (£34 M.) and strike
aircraft. (N.A. 39). Wd. prefer to concentrate nuclear on air force.
85
D.S. Reduced navy must be up to date. Sea-slug is only form of missile
defence wh. R.N. will have. N.A. 39 : wd. be case for scrapping,
were it not tht. RAF will need it too. Only machine capable of
low-level long-range attack.
S. R.N. must have means of a.a. defence : sea-slug is only means.
A.J. Logic of P.T. argument = no power to fight limited war, forced
prematurely into major.
P.T. Accept our share in main deterrent. But is R.N. also to have tactical
nuclear power?
Hail. If you put yrself in posn where you can only wage major war, enemy
can win every minor war and erode your posn. successively.
P.M. Avoid prejudging this issue in this White Paper. Depends on 2nd.
round. “… some of which will be equipped with g.m.”
D.S. This has bn. said before: cf. W. Paper of 1956.
P.T. Cd. Ty., M/D. and Admy. cost this naval p’mme before publicn.
Agreed : stet. para. 44 as now : but argue quantity on “2nd
round.”
P.M. Para. 48 might come better in passage on N.S.
D.S. Paras. 50-53. Is redn. to be justified on mil. grounds, economic or
abolition of N.S.? Hear C.O.S. on this.
W.D. Recognise over-riding factor of economic need. But on strictly mil.
grounds we cdn’t say 380.000 regulars wd. suffice to meet
commitments. No justifn. qua reduced threat in reducg. forces :
effect on Allies, who won’t increase their contn. to off-set redn. in
ours. Can’t be precise on necessary total : but 410.000 regulars
wd. avoid critical redn. in technical and fighting strength. This
30.000 makes all the difference. C.O.S. therefore desire tht. redn.
shd. be justified on economic grounds. Prefer a re-draft of para.
50. – submitted.
P.M. Effect on Allies.
? Say : these are commitments. Believe they can be met by much
smaller forces than now [if regulars]. Our mil. tradn. based on
voluntary professional forces. Wd. like to get back to it. Will
take much time. This year we shall reduce to x. From now we
shall aim at all-regular forces. But shall meet our responsibilites.
Shall continue to proceed in consultn our Allies. Cost of N.S.
training (para 48). It is our purpose to revert, if we can, to tradns.
of our past.
86
D.S. Believe we must say we are going over to regular forces and give a date
for it. It is 5 years ahead.
P.M. More emphasis on 1st. year because concerns most closely people like
Mollet and Adenauer.
H. “It is our aim to raise regular forces sufficient to meet commitments set
out in this paper.”
S.Ll. A formula – get it from him.
D.S. Can’t get money reductions w’out a firm plan and it can’t be kept secret.
P.M. ? Dispense with headings – they sharpen it all up.
Also : develop argument and conclude with numbers.
I.M. Put paras 50-53 after 68.
D.S. Yes : put 48 before 54 as a lead-in.
Paras. 54-59 cd. be reduced and combined with 60-64. Paras 65-68 cd.
go in after 45.
P.M. Paras 1-45. This is military plan. Pt. II – how do we get the forces
required. We shall discharge our responsibilities.
H.W. Stress argument tht. regular forces will be more efficient because of 48.
P.M. Start : *all Br. Govts. are v. conscriptn. Quote an earlier statement.
But must discharge responsibilities. Process of going over to
regulars will take 6 years. If we succeed, we cd. meet our obligns.
with 380.000 regulars. * Para 60 with a quote.
P.T. Inducements. Problem is Army only. Expensive to increase
attractions all round.
Barracks – w’in limits of resources.
Compensation – we must know what we intend to do, and what it will
cost.
[Exit 4 Def. Ministers and C.O.S.
2. Singapore.
Deferred to a later meeting.
