C.C. 6(57). 1st February, 1957.

1. Cyprus. [Enter J.H., Mancroft, E.H.
S.Ll. U.S. resoln. commendg. renewed negotns. betwn. Powers concerned
and local communities. Don’t like this – U.N. telling us what to
do in reln. to own populn. – also Makarios. Have urged U.S. not
to proceed with it. Prefer Italian resoln. wh. is limited to 3 Power
negotn.
P.M. Welcome first part of their’s – to please them – so long as second is
limited as Italian resoln. A kindly approach – not stuffy.
2. Jordan.
S.Ll. Recommendns. – para. 24.
Have always said propn. of our stores were earmarked for use by Arab
Army. Ready therefore to make some concession (f) on this as
lever for getting rest moved to Iraq.
Mention points (h) and (i).
M. Wright asks tht. we shd. not give better terms to J. than we did to
Iraq.
P.T. Quite a lot of money – £12 M stocks £4½ M installations £2 m.
subsidy. I accept a) and c) and g).
On b) : I wd. like to keep back some of £1.8 M subsidy in part
payment.
On d) : we aren’t in posn. to give equipmt. round M/E : some countries
cd. make some payment.
On e) I wd. defer suggn. of a stock-pile : can be v. expensive.
On i) I wd. be averse to spending £4 M. on these.
J.H. On d) and c). Wd. be 3 mos. from 1/4 before we cd. get out fr. Aquaba
if we have to remove by sea.
P.M. Induce them to agree, by concessions of what *isn’t useful to us, to
removal by road to Iraq. *i.e. equipmt. they have and installns. we
can’t remove.
M. On (f) mobilisation stocks shd. be our last concession : viz., put (i)
down to the bottom.
D.E. Aqaba port : various U.K. contractors are concerned in this : and may
be valuable to us to have facilities to remove phosphate rock
from there. Whole project : £1.9M, of which some paid.
P.M. This wd. give us foothold (better because civilian) for the future.
28
L.P. Is their good-will i) obtainable or ii) worth having. If we have no
prospect of saving anythg. from this wreck, I wdn’t pour good
money after bad. I wd. be inclined to pay only what we must to
get out what we want.
S.Ll. On developmt. we must defer decision.
There is some hope of some goodwill : but not enough to justify a high
price.
Memo. is only an outline. We shall control negotns., with P.T.
J.H. Don’t want to volunteer (g). Not to be discussed w’out refce. back. Agreed.
D.E. Do I advise contractors to stop making equipment?
P.T. B/E. don’t think it necessary to pay anything to keep J. in sterling area.
[Exit J.H., Mancr.
[Enter Selk.
3. Naval Discipline Act.
Selk. Doubt wtr this will be controversial. Hope legn. can go fwd. this
session.
R.A.B. Ready to accept it for ’pmme. H/C. want it. May take some time.
Approved.
[Exit Selk.
[Enter B.C.
4. N. Insurance : Unemployment Benefit.
I.M. Earlier Cab. discn. Decn. on timing to be taken in Jan., in light of wage
sitn. – on basis tht., if industrial relns. were good, mght be unwise
to inject this controversial ques. I am now against extreme
course. But ready to try smaller plan for making it imposs. for a
man to count a day on wh. he never intended to work. Suggest
we go on with this limited proposal.
M. Support this v. wise proposal.
B.C. Takes a/c of prevalence of 5-day week.
Wd. prefer it in Bill, of which remainder is humane. It has bn. so
arranged.
I.M. Will consider wtr I shd. mention it informally to T.U.C.
R.A.B. Accept this – subject to timing of introdn. of Bill.
[Exit B.C.
29
5. Oversea Broadcasting.
C.H. Propose statement tht. Estimates may need re-considn. in light of
review. But reservation re b’casting. Report on that is to come
w’in general review : m’while standstill on Estimate. Reason :
gt. technical problems to be solved : B/T. want to reserve decn .
on b’casting until they know plans for other infn. services.
M’while, two decisions needed urgently:-
(1) Shark. Known in M/E. to be ours. Requisitioned 31/10. P’mme
is part B.B.C. and part F.O. Propose therefore that it be bought
by U.K. Govt. overtly – lease it to B.B.C. for next 6 months.
(2) New transmitter for M/E., bought by F.O. Installn. costs wd. be
heavy. Propose we get on with this and m’while consider how to
use it.
S.Ll. Support these proposals.
Fit pattern. M’tain B.B.C. oversea p’mme : improve its content
perhaps : while we can’t dictate content, we shd. direct its
deployment: but must accept fact tht. it won’t always be pro-
Govt. Therefore, we must have alternative “voice”. Shark being
blown, we must re-create another light p’mme. Favour (2)
therefore.
C.H. B.B.C. will be audible even tho’ (2) is provide.
Intend later to submit proposals for influencing content of B.B.C.
p’mme.
S.Ll. Relations with B.B.C. are becomg. a little easier.
L.P. B.B.C.’s “impartial” presentation of informn. overseas raises gt. issue
of principle.
Quoted Arabic b’cast : putting Ll.G.’s views on Suez.
The Br. view = view of HMGovt.
Cd. we not at least have an hour for official statement.
Hail. Fr. personal experience. English language b’casts are v. valuable
because keep English abroad and English-speakers in touch. On
these the “impartial” attitude is justified. F. language b’casts are
v. different. No pol. purpose in giving those audiences good
entertainment and impartial informn. This is pure waste of
money.
P.T. £11.7 has risen to £13 odd : £1½ M. increase.
Project (2). V. costly £200.000.
Project (1) is book-keeping entry. The amount cd. be less.
Wd. strengthen hands of S.Ll. and C.H. if we as Cab. rule that this
increased exp’re must be matched by redns. elsewhere. Much of
B.B.C. b’casting is sheer waste of money.
Infn. services generally must be screened. cf. cultural attachés in
Germany.
30
S.Ll. Accept principle of switching. But these 2 proposals together will cost
less than we spent on Shark.
P.M. (1) will be B.B.C. but audible. Hope we can improve content.
Agree we buy this, entering cost at lowest figure consistent with
m’taining the cover. Review again wtr running cost is £180.000
p.a. – C.H. and Ty. to agree on that.
(2) gives us direct control over content.
C.H. and F.O. to report further on points raised by L.P. and Hail. re
control over, or improvement of, f. language b’casts of B.B.C.
P.T. Reserve my right to insist tht. expansions be matched by redns.
H. £60.000 betwn. C.O. and C.R.O. for new informn. officers (India :
Canada etc.,) C.O. and I want to go on with this w’out prejudice
to total votes.
C.H. Can’t have greater efficiency w’out greater cost.
S.Ll. £11 M. in 1949/1950/. Only £½ M more now. Cdn’t accept big cuts
in defence unless we are going on to expand informn.
P.M. Figure for Estimate shd. be no larger than last year.
C.H. That can’t be secured.
P.M. Then, at least, these additional items must be offset by reductions
elsewhere.
6. Northern Ireland.
R.A.B. No change in status quo. No negotiations. Agreed.
[Enter Att.G., Perth.
7. Gold Coast.
H. In H/L. debate y’day. C.D. and W. Corpn. cd. continue to operate in
Ghana, unless specifically excluded. Cl. 3. of Bill is regarded as
offensive to Ghana. Also thght unwise to deprive ourselves of
possibility of using this instrument after review of developmt.
needs of new members of Comm. They therefore press for Cl. 3
to be removed : and matter left to direction by S of S. to Corpn.
Att.G. G., ceasing to be a Colony, will be outside scope of Corpn. Cl. 3 gives
powers you wdn’t otherwise have.
P. We cd. deal with it by direction to Corpn. – if it weren’t for Att.G.’s
view.
31
P.M. Wd. like a new concept on development in Comm. – not drawg. sharp
distinction betwn. Col. and Doms., but distinction rather by
reference to real needs.
How do we get Bill thro’ – pending this review.
L.P. Favour acceptg. Swinton’s compromise.
P.T. Delete subsections (1) and (4). Say can’t use this Act for this purpose.
Reviewg. whole position.
L.P. They will need to be squared in advance.
Agreed : Col. Policy Cttee. to settle this on Monday.
[Exit P. and Att.G.
8. Suez Canal.
S.Ll. For informn.
Para. 6 was pessimistic. Posn. looks better.
P.M. Tel. 156 from W’ton is more encouraging.
H.W. If Dulles wd. say that publicly, defeat wd. be turned into victory.
P.M. Let S.Ll. ask him to do it – in one of his dedicated moments.
