C.C. 58(57). 29th July, 1957.

Pensions. [Enter E.M., B.C., E.H.
P.M. Must be an increase in o.a.p. soon. Must be by Bill on orthodox basis,
introduced separately so as not to be delayed by discussion of
larger measure.
i). Amount of increase. 5/= wd. cover increased c/living. Or 7/6,
but if tobacco concession were w’drawn wd. be equivalent of
only 5/= for smokers. Or 10/= which wd. cover rise in c/living and
w’drawal of tobacco.
ii) Timing. Impressed by weight of argument v. anticipating Parly.
approval. Mght have done it on Peake’s Bill, where all agreed on
need to increase rate. But now the Bill will come in atmosphere
of Crossman’s plan. If we can’t get it into opn. by Xmas, I wd.
prefer to do it in normal way – w’out now altering date of reassembly
of Parlt, which wd. look as to’ we cdn’t make up our
minds. 2nd. Rdg. day after Queen’s Speech : carry Bill into law
in 10 days or so. R. Assent, at earliest, by 21st. Nov. Cd. start
printing after Cttee. stage in H/C. Proposals of 2nd. Bill wd. be
made known at that time – after mention in Queen’s Speech.
iii) Must increased contributions be exacted at same time as
increased benefits.
R.A.B. On (ii) aim at getting rates and contns. as soon as possible in regular
fashion w’out altering date of re-assembly of Parlt. Cttee. to
make time-table.
On (i) I favour 10/= plus w’drawal of tobacco concession.
Contribution : wd. prefer 17/6 and justify this by decision to go fwd.
with graduated scheme, announced in Queen’s Speech.
Long-term plan. Contracting-out wd. be v. costly and administratively
difficult. Wd. wish my Cttee. to consider it still further this week.
I.M. Agree with R.A.B. on all points save contracting-out. I attach great
importce. to that. W’out it, no approval of existing schemes or
new ones. Also : diff. for us to put fwd. plan more stringent than
Crossman’s – wh. does allow for contractg. out. If we can’t find
a way of doing this, we must find a way of encouraging voluntary
schemes.
B.C. Timing. Accept Jan. proposals, but wd. still need early decisions on
rates and contns. For work on war pensions (para. 12) wd. start.
And there might be leak.
P.T. Leak wd. be politically disadvantageous.
R.A.B. Cdn’t risk this until October.
I.M. Not until after Party Conference.
173
P.M. * Can’t begin para. 12 work before 14/10. Base time-table on that.
| Not politically necessary to give w. pension paymts a 2 wk. lead
x| over o.a.p. Not more than 1 week : and if necessary simultaneous.
| Aim at end of January.
B.C. Diffy. remains about N.A. rates. Hope, however, Chairman wd. p’pone
his increase until ours if ours was to come in Feby.
H.B. Try hard to hold this back until ours.
Timing : Agreed as at x/. Hope N.A. rates may come in
simultaneously.
Bill can be introduced in spill-over and allowed to die, if there has
been a leak. If none, Bill need not be introduced until outset of
new session.
Amount.
M. If tobacco concession w’drawn, Labour may offer to restore it.
H.A. Favour 10/= minus tobacco concession.
H.B. Labour wd. never re-introduce it. R.S.C. tried to abolish it.
Ch.H. Widely known to be unfair.
P.T. Wise to make increase now which will hold posn. until end/Parlt.
Ready to accept 10/= on that basis if we w’draw tobacco
concession and get scheme on a sound basis via graduated
benefits.
B.C. Doubt if Party wd. support such a scheme unless it contained provn. for
contractg. out.
Agreed 10/= plus w’drawing tobacco concession.
(P.T. Subject to their being a graduated scheme.)
Contribution. Now 13/7. Increase to 18/4 or 17/6 if graduated scheme.
P.T. W’out some overload we shall have deficit in next 2 years which will
be carried on Budget – making tax remission more difficult.
After further discussion – general disposn. to look at possibility of
contn. of 18/1 in order to give increase of 12/= in benefit.
Agreed : Meet on Friday 2.30 p.m. H/C. to take final decisions.
