C.C. 52 (57) 16th July, 1957

1. Cyprus. [Enter E.H.
Difficulties of new plan discussed.
S.Ll. Presentation. How get over our acceptance of s-determination : Put it
fwd. as plan for 10 years?
A.L.B. Objns. to time-limit?
P.M. Put it fwd. as alternative : for s-determination wd. mean partition.
P.M. Timing. Before U.N.? Or do we in interval hold consultny. (3 Power
Mtg or comments on R’cliffe report) to fill in time.
S.Ll. Cd. we use interval to demolish concept of independence on U.S.
model. Best way to do that wd. be 3 Power Mtg : with U.S. and
Spaak as observers. Shortly before U.N. mtg (e.g. late Sept) and
produce plan twds end of it.
P.M. i) Work out plan in greater detail.
ii) 3 Power Mtg. with U.S. and Spaak as observers – late September.
We shall be criticised for not incldg. repves. of Cypriots.
A.L.B. Possibly Cypriot delegations cd. be invited to give evidence.
S.Ll. Wd. mix up internal and external aspects of the problem.
Agreed : M/D. to complete examn. of enclaves.
N.B. to organise further considn. of constitl. pts.
S.Ll. and A.L.B. and K. to work out procedure and
timetable.
2. Suez Canal.
S.Ll. Finance for clearance of Canal.
P.M. Our U.N. share wd. be 71/2% : that wd. have cost us $1m. We have in
fact spent $1.25 m. in services.
What machinery? A U.N. agent wd. be preferable to collection by
Nasser.
S.Ll. Latter wd. be acceptable if we were accepted as creditor.
P.M. U.N. agent to receive periodical paymts from Canal Authority. There
ought to be some emphasis on fact tht. N. has accepted U.N.
concern.
157
P.T. Be careful not to get surcharge too high.
P.M. Our claims must be acknowledged.
It must be non-discriminatory.
Dpts. shd. consider urgently how high a surcharge traffic can bear:
viz., rate of collection.
J.M. Surcharges by Canal Authy. – dangerous precedent.
P.M. Can’t it be done by cover of e.g. U.N.
S.Ll. Awkward : don’t want U.N. debate. Prs. agreemt. betwn Sec. Genl. and N.
P.M. x/ Wd. be even better if all creditors wd. write off their share. Work out
what it wd. cost in payment of surcharges on their national
tonnage.
Agreed : put x/ as first priority.
3. Israel.
S.Ll. Shell and B.P. have agreed to close down their marketing organn. in
Israel. (S. Arabia have told Shell they must get out of S. Arabia
if they don’t.)
Shell have told Israel tht. reason is political viz., tht. their commercial
interests in Arab States will suffer if they don’t.
Israel will regard this as thin end of wedge.
P.M. There is a difference : big Br. companies don’t get their materials from
Arab States.
D.E. This pressure is being applied to Br. firms, other than oil companies. #
P.T. The oil cos. can justify this decision on commercial grounds.
M. Yes : that is so : stand on it.
Agreed : i) no interference on this particular ques (oil cos.)
ii) E.P.C. to consider genl. ques of Arabs boy-cotting
Trade with Israel via Br. firms, with a view to
common line with U.S.
iii) But m’while tell oil cos. that we shd. wish Israel to
continue to be supplied with oil.
4. Disarmament.
S.Ll. Will take some time to establish a western posn.
158
M’while we can’t avoid debate.
P.M. Some advantage in having it – as for Cyprus y’day.
5. Industrial Disputes. Bus Strike.
I.M. Likely to have strike (w’spread outside Ldn.) on Fri. p.m. T. and G.
Workers Union is concerned in both cases. They obtained offer of
7/6d. fr. municipal undertakgs. This was acceptable to officials
negotiating : but Cousins thght he cd. get more. On the nonmunicipal,
no negotns. : offer of 3/= : strike called. Employers
(includg. B.T.C.) are willing to refer to arbitration, where about 7/6
mght be awarded : they have asked me to refer it. Union has
however said that they won’t participate. That – intolerable : I have
therefore referred it over heads of Union. This will exacerbate
feelings in Union. Cousins may try to spread this – to municipal
buses and prs. to other transport incldg. docks. Econ. effects not v.
large: tho’ inconvenience great. But we can’t accept dictation by
Cousins.
Decision of tribunal is not binding. A reason v. refusing to go to it.
P.T. We shd. take no action twds. settling this. We must stand firm. No
concession at present time – on wages or condns. . – in disputes
wh. involve natd. indies.
I.M. I cd. not prevent municipals from increasing their offer.
P.M. Our action at present is limited to referring to arbitn. – wh. we have done.
Agreed : support M/L. in action which he has taken.
6. Wages Policy.
P.T. Mtg. Unions etc., next week. Hope Cab. agree tht. we shd. go on with
our plan.
7. Jute Industry.
D.E. As in memo. Hoping to get some more diversification of industry in
Dundee.
J.M. Regret this, but concln. is inevitable. May cause some unemplt.
Labour Party have promised to cure it by State trading.
P.M. Protection run mad : encourages the substitute.
A.L.B. But concentrated in one place and expanded at Govt. request.
