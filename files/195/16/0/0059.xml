H.A. N.F.U.’s wd. prefer to stand out of Franks : but we cdn’t justify that. I
can’t suspend Pt. II. Driven therefore to repeal. That, on whole,
will be popular and will be accepted by agricultural community –
tho’ opposed by Labour.
On tenure, we shd. be mistaken in missing opportunity of agreement
reached. Only likely criticism is tht. we mght have gone further.
Rents : no objective criticism v. our proposal. Land-owners wd. feel
let down if we didn’t act on agreement reached.
P.M. By what amount wd. rents rise on criterion now suggested – open
market value.
H.A. Perhaps, at a guess, an average of 150% over pre-war as cpd. with 50%
now.
Proposals approved – subject to soft-pedalling on early
detailed announcement re rents.
