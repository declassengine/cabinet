2. Parliament.

Chequers talks on defence : broad conclns. subsequently confirmed by
Def. Cttee. Wh. Paper and Estimates are now being framed
accordingly.
Conclns. Man-power : distribution : N.S. problem.
Future organisation : common services – possibility of
merger or further appln. of principle of major user.
Overseas commands.
Nuclear Power : General principles agreed for further
work.
R.A.B. C. Defence. Can’t be swept aside. Morale effect of declaring we rely
on deterrent but provide no C.D.
P.T. Working to £1475 M. for next year, w’out takg a/c of U.S. or Germ.
aid.
D.S. Wd. have bn £1700 M. if A.H. and I had done nil.

[Enter A.J.

repute.

69
Agitation in J. is largely inspired by Communists.
P.M. Will appoint a Minister to take charge and prs. a Cttee.
[Exit A.J.
5. Europe. N.A.T.O. Contribution.
S.Ll. Looks as tho’ Fr. will oppose our plans in N.A.T.O. But Saceur and
Ismay are willing to get it thro’ on Wed.
W.E.U. will then meet on Fri. or Saty. – and Fr. will try for hostile resoln.
F.R.’s suggn. (Tel. Paris 82) tht. we shd. stress oppn’s. for later
consultn. on Annual Review. If we accept this advice, must avoid
appearance of weakening. Stand firm on 57/8, but open to discn.
on 58/9. Admits oblign. to consult with N.A.T.O. on each year’s
effects of our plan. But we cd. ask for it to be concluded early –
e.g. this summer.
P.M. Must carry out our plan. In event, we may have to denounce Treaty
(W.E.U.) or to cheat by w’drawg. for overseas service elsewhere.
S.Ll. No advance indicn. of compromise at W.E.U. Mtg.
J.M. Presentn. to Europe. Weakening or breach of Paris Agreemts [Enter D.E.
plus diffies. over Free Trade Area : wd. do v. gt. damage.
S.Ll. We also face gt. diffies. over Naval cuts to Saclant. Better pro. tem. to
avoid disclosing specific proposals.
6. Congress for Rights in Russia.
S.Ll. Read terms of proposed reply : Approved.
7. Jordan.
S.Ll. Agreemt. about to be concluded. Announce 15/3.
Shall get some stores out. Notional subsidy paymt. for Feby., tho’ no new
money : no payment fr. March onwds. Shall get £4 M. or so fr.
Jordan – £1 M. down and rest in instalments of £½ M. each 6 mos.
Worth this price to escape this commitment.
P.T. Agree : cdn’t expect to do better.
8. Suez Canal.
S.Ll. E. have avoided replying to Sec. Genl.’s letter.
We have urged Menzies to press Dulles to move.
No further action possible pro. tem.
70
U.S. financial pressure is only card to be played. We must force Dulles to
apply it.
9. Israel.
S.Ll. E. statement re Gaza. Claim they are still at war – wd. justify I in reoccupying.
Privately, U.S. is promising to take Israeli ship with oil thro’ Aquba.
Have told P.D. in N. Yk. to discuss with friendly Delegns. how U.N.
will react to E. affront. Also asked H.M. Amb. W’ton. to take it up.
Must then await developmts.
8. Suez Canal (resumed).
H.W. What do Br. ship-owners say if E. declares tht. Canal is open?
S.Ll. Let them enquire re technical ques (pilots, buoys etc.) – avoid
reference to dues : avoid threat of boycott.
H.W. i.e. hold off on techn. grounds until we get further in pol. discussions.
P.M. | Wd. wish to have statement of our legal powers in reln. to Br. shipping.
x| To what extent can we control their action.
| Also : relative nos. of ships.
10. Industrial Relations.
I.M. N.U.R. cd. have got 3½% increase. At arbitn., Chairman wants to give
3%. This wd. lead to strike. 4% might be accepted. Decn. early
next week.
Shipbuilding. Usually follows engineering. This time ship-bldg. is
going first. Askg. for 10%. Employers have refused to give
anything, in pursuance of Govt.’s policy of wage restraint.
Workers therefore regard strike as action v. Govt. And talk in D.
worker etc., is of genl. strike. No point in ct. of enquiry or M/L.
talks. Alternatives: strike or arbitration. Evershed is my choice.
Propose to put that to H/C. to-day. Unlikely to succeed. If it
fails, we shall have protracted strike – 4 wks. at least. Much will
turn on presentn. in Press.
Draft statement submitted.
M. Engineering employers are likely to reject similar appln. to-day.
I.M. Workers likely to reject arbitn. : employers wd. accept it reluctantly.
[Exit I.M.
[Enter J.B.C.
71
11. Pensions : Gas and Electricity Industries.
M. As in memo.
Diffy. = danger of extension to transport. Cost in gas and
electricity wd. be v. small – (under £30.000 in each about
£200.000 all told). But transport wd. cost around £1M.
H.W. If in private business B.T.C. wd. say “we can’t afford to do this”.
B.T.C. made ex-gratia paymts. (£650.000) on the occasion of
earlier settlement. For pensioned staff grades we cd. settle for
another £650.000. But if it went into wages grades it wd. cost
another £1M.
Believe B.R. wd. refuse to do it. I shd. have to make Regns. against his
wish. An awkward precedent.
P.M. x/ Equalising betwn. municipal and co. employees need not have this
result?
H.W. Reason : rlway pensioners were excluded from national pensions.
Rlway pension increases have always lagged behind others e.g.
C. Service.
P.M. On x/ my meaning was : why shd. it extend into wages grades?
H.W. Mght hold out v. that. But pressure will increase because miners have
supplementary schemes.
P.T. My advisers agree with M/Power – can’t justify position.
Suggest M/P. shd. go ahead. M/T. shd. delay for as long as he can and
shd. do his utmost to restrict it to salaried grades in rlways.
Agreed : as proposed by P.T.
[Exit J.B.C.
12. Farm Price Review.
H.A. Have seen farmers’ repves. Believe agreemt. cd. be reached with
£14¼ M. (£12 fr. Exchequer) including ¼d.on milk and
m’taining retail price at 8d.
For farmers, the ¼d. is symbolic – to enable them to say they have got
somethg. for small men.
I have myself rejected 2 other proposals of farmers – £17 and £15 M.
Difficult, politically, for us to reject agreed settlement for sake of
£2¼ M. to be paid by consumer.
P.T. We all agreed to make no concession on milk. Surely we shd. not
encourage milk prodn. further. If there is surplus, how can we
m’tain 8d. price? Will be obvious tht. this is pol. concession.
Propose we stand on £12 M.
72
Ch.H. We went from £10 – £12 M. on pol. grounds.
R.A.B. Agric. seats are our only anchor in the country. If we face trouble in
industry, can we afford to alienate farmers?
Admit econ. case v. milk increase.
But wd. prefer to seek agreed settlement – on milk, or silage (which
wd. be sounder).
Prodn. is not rising enough : but it is rising in agriculture. Don’t
interrupt that.
L.P. If concession is to be made, don’t make it on milk.
