C.C. 21(57). 18th March, 1957.

1. Cyprus. [Enter E.H.
A.L.B. Some response to Eoka offer. Draft statement submitted.
S.Ll. Ankara Tel. 266. Reaction of T. Govt. to rumours of poss. release of
Makarios. Strong objn. on procedure – closer consultn. with T. –
and on substance – separation of internal from internatl. aspects.
T. unwilling to consider R. report outside framework of internatl.
situation. T. also object to discn. by N.A.T.O. – prefer offer of
tri-partite talks.
Some of these points were covered in our tel. 620, which crossed.
P.M. Choice : statement on lines we propose, or give way to Turks.
S.Ll. T. suspect us of weakness and think they must stiffen us.
i) NATO invitn. : has bn. extended. Must persuade T. to accept it.
ii) 3-Power confce. Not excluded, under N.A.T.O. Don’t want it
under U.N. for don’t want to report back to U.N. We are safer in
N.A.T.O. Conference now won’t help twds. soln. NATO
conciliation method is more promising.
iii).Cyprus internal problems.
L.P. My view was in favour of separating acceptance of NATO offer from
negotns. on internal side of problem. I feel that much more
strongly now, in view of T. re-action. Can’t afford to alienate
them.
A.L.B. M’while what do we say if NATO ask us what response we will make
to Eoka declaration. Don’t want to respond to that under
pressure fr. N.A.T.O.
P.M. Consider sitn. on merits. Do we mean to go on until we have
eradicated terrorism? Or do we think it a nationalist movement
as in Eire?
It is eating up our mil. strength : and jeopardising our internatl. reputn.
Talks won’t solve this problem. No real solution save partition.
Sooner we begin to demonstrate that, the better our chance of
getting rid of this problem before next Election.
D.S. Cyprus is of no mil. value to U.K. alone. Partition, with an internatl.
base, is best solution.
1) Agreed : NATO offer must be accepted.
D.S. Wise to get Makarios released if he will give support to cessation of
terrorism. Doubtful wtr it wd. be wise to contemplate
discussions with him.
77
P.M. Latter is not essential part of plan.
Wd. be enough to say, in reply to Eoka decln., that we will release
M. if he declares in favour of ending terrorism.
A.L.B. Ready to move in 2 stages, on that basis.
2) Agreed : limit action re Markarios to offer to release (tho’ not
to Cyprus) if he declares v. terrorism.
3) Agreed : offer safe-conduct to Grivas and others.
P.M. Truce. Can’t call off all security measures. Mght avoid large-scale
mil. opns.
A.L.B. I have so informed Govr. already.
R.A.B. Counselled firmness. On 2) above : doubtful wtr we shd. go beyond
repeatg. earlier statement viz., if he declares v. terrorism, new
situatn. will be created.
L.P. Don’t go fwd. with any discns. on internal sitn. until NATO initiative
has made progress.
P.M. Study must now be made of partition as a means of absolving us from
this responsibility.
A.L.B. At least a military study. C.O.S. have h’to said tht. we can’t fulfil our
mil. obligns. with partitioned island.
4) Agreed. Study our long-term needs in C.
L.P. Believe 2) will have bad effect on Tory opinion.
H.A. Put the greater emphasis on Grivas and tone down reference to Mak.?
After further discussion on 2) – decided to look at a revised draft.
C.P. Cttee. to consider at 12.30 p.m. on Tuesday.
[Exit K.
[Enter 3 Serv. Ministers and M/S.
2. Defence Policy.
P.M. Presentn. i) Must not denigrate our own record since ’51. Put out
history from re-armament, thro’ long-haul, to new look (firepower).
ii) Must be cautious over N.S., even if we scrape thro’
the W.E.U. mtg.
Have discussed with D.S. – who will re-cast on these lines.
D.S. Plan – all-regular Forces betwn. 350.000 and 400.000. Commitments
we shall have to relinquish – w’drawal of 30.000 fr. Germany and
78
halving 2nd. T.A.F. : redn. of overseas garrisons in colonies etc.,
to level needed for internal security alone : abandonmt. of landforce
reserve in M/E. : gt. redn. in naval support of Saclant.
R.A.F. Acceptance of view tht. air-defence of cities is impracticable
Real reliance on deterrent vice defence. Air defence therefore
limited to defence of deterrent.
R.N. Concentrate on 3 carrier groups.
Regular recruitment – will be necessary to offer improved condns.
some of which will cost money.
On presentation, I accept P.M.’s suggestions. But think we shall have
to indicate date to which we are working in reln. to all-regular
Forces.
S. Will be great shock. Success depends on i) long-term engaged men.
Para. 19 will rock them ii) reactions of Allies who will be
alarmed at 33⅓% cut. May mean tht. because of size of contns.
U.S. will have command in Atlantic, Fr. in Channel and Italians in
Med. Suggest therefore tht. para. 19 shd. include promise to
negotiate or consult with Allies before we act.
J.H. Plan involves further redn. of land-forces in G. after 1960, and para. 19
also implies more than we shall actually have in SEATO.
Run-down will be hard to achieve if there are delays in abandoning
commitments e.g. Libya.
Relinquishment of N.S. Diffy. will be to find enough technicians for
wh. we now rely so largely on N.S. men. Shall have to use
inducements, wh. will cost money.
Removal of 2 T.A. Divns. from Saceur. Is this good moment (Allies) to
be so frank on this?
G.W. Effect on NATO. Endorse what has bn. said. Consultn. before we
announce so bluntly.
Regular recruitment. Para. 24. Tone this down. Will have difft.
effects in diff. Services. Better to handle this separately for each
Service.
I.M. N.S. Welcome this. Must work to a firm p’mme. Problem will be
mainly for W.O.
Paras. 23-4 need adjustment to avoid undue alarm.
S.Ll. What am I to say to W.E.U. Ministers to-night on N.S.?
D.S. If we carry out our commitments to NATO., our method of enlistment
is our own affair. We have told NATO of our plans re forces,
except Navy – which doesn’t affect W.E.U.
S.Ll. Can I say we envisage a plan over a no. of years: but reduced force will
be kept in Europe for several years, subject to resolution of
financial problems.
79
P.M. But attack their concept tht. nos. is all that matters. That was what
brought France down in ’40. Lecture them on that – small,
regular Forces well-equipped.
Give them references to earlier Parly. statements tht. it is our aim to
end N.S. as soon as we can.
Then advance copies of W. Paper, with explann., to Govts.
* Publication cd. be delayed until 5/4. Debate before or after Easter, as
Oppn. prefer.
L.P. Para. 12(d). A and N.Z. haven’t bn. asked: will resent this.
Substitute “who contribute sea and air forces to Comm. reserve.”
D.S. Will confer with C.R.O. Austr. H. Commr. thght. they wd. like it.
L.P. Para. on Commonwealth consultn. shd. be added.
L.P. Para. 9(a) needs adjustment. P.M.’s formula.
P.M. T.A. Divns. Need we say this?
D.S. Shall be asked in debate.
S.Ll. If regular Army is to run down so low, is it wise to have no T.A.
reserve.
P.M. Delete this reference. Keep our hands free.
Hail. Is N.A.T.O. sufficiently emphasised as clue to our strategic posn.?
Against R. aggression, N.A.T.O. is our only shield. That is not
brght out. Too much is made of nuclear deterrent.
Loss of NATO naval commands wd. wreck Commonw. co-operation.
NATO won’t hold together unless U.K. or U.S. hold the commands.
Put more emphasis on pol. cohesion of N.A.T.O. as our main defence.
D.S. See para. 7(c).
A.L.B. Concerned about our commitments wh. remain, esp. in F/E. Will a
central reserve suffice for these? Defence treaty with Malaya :
negotiatg. now with Singapore. Redns. in H. Kong. Can we hope
to be able to fulfil our undertakgs wh. we are now renewing.
Cyprus : if we are not to have land forces in Med., future of C. takes on
a diff. complexion. If we say it, pressure will be brght on us to
relinquish our claims.
R.A.B. This is revolutionary. Changes whole character of Br. power. cf. R.N.
– protection overseas of our Col. possns. must be relinquished if
no cruisers.
Don’t believe we can hold H. Kong with reduced forces of this order.
Doubt if we shall be able to keep it.
80
A.L.B. If we don’t fall below this level, Govr. wd. be reasonably happy.
R.A.B. C. Def. Must we say we can’t protect cities. Wd. wish to discuss this
and para. 22.
H.W. Civil aviation. Mobility of troops puts v. gt. obligns. on civil aviation.
Para. 14(b) will imply tht. all will be done by Transport
Command and shipping cos. will be discouraged fr. continuing
charter aircraft.
P.M. All other comments to go to M/Defence.
J.M. Is balance held betwn. nuclear contn. and central reserve, wh. is
valuable for cold-war. Are we spendg. too much on first?
3. Bermuda Conference.
P.M. R.A.B. will be i/c in my absence.
If situation deteriorates, I cd. cancel St. Laurent’s visit and return on
Sunday p.m.
4. Industrial Disputes.
I.M. Atmosphere in ship-bldg is a little easier.
Rlway award will be given on Wedy.
Engineering : feeling is bitter – they wd. reject Evershed arbitrn.
Propose to invite 2 sides to M/L. to-morrow.
Main aim : isolate rlways from the other two.
