C.C. 8(57). 7th February, 1957.

1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.
2. Foreign Affairs.
[Earlier items not heard.]
Yemen.
S.Ll. Still think it’s too dangerous to admit U.N. observers.
Position is not so v. bad. Play it down.
A.L.B. Yemenis have artillery. Flying out guns for our side.
3. Ghana.
A.L.B. Purpose of visit – to re-assure Ashanti and N. Territory Chiefs, who are
anxious about their traditional rights. Thought all was well. But
Nkrumah threatened to go back on agreement in reln. to security.
Sent 2 emissaries. I have told them we can’t vary our agreement.
Believe I may have convinced them. Propose to go ahead with
publn. of W. Paper to-morrow.
D/Kent is now willing to stay on and visit Northern territories.
4. E/West Trade. Copper Wire.
D.E. Last year embargo was lifted, and firms got contracts.
In Oct. Aberdare Cables were told they had every prospect of licence
for this year as for last. They have 2.800 t. carry-over from last
year. Think we must give them total licence for 10,000 t. this
year. Their competitor has licence for 40.000 t.
Strategic objns. are no stronger than in ’54.
S.Ll. Rise from 5.000 to 40.000 t. in 2 years. U.S. will be upset if it rises to
50.000.
See case for 10.000 to Aberdare. Can we not space out C. Parkinson
deliveries so that amount actually shipped in ’57 doesn’t
x| exceed 40.000. To hold position around that figure.
D.S. Wd. be mistake to give U.S. impn. tht. we are irresponsible over this.
Don’t believe, however, tht. Sov. will give priority to defence
needs.
P.T. US. haven’t moved an inch twds. liberalisation.
39
A.L.B. I Agree.
S.Ll. They have accepted our use of exceptions procedure w’out protest.
P.T. But they are now going back on it.
L.P. Avoid irritating U.S. at this stage.
P.M. Get delivery dates for both firms and try for solution on lines of x/.
Report to me and I will settle.
M. Tell firms not to give publicity to this anyway.
5. Education.
Hail. Support memo. by predecessor. But, as written before discussion of
econ. sitn., have added supplementary memo.
Need for advance on educn. front is greater now – ? because block
grant.
Increase in school popn. : “bulge” is passing to secondary schools,
where cost is higher ……..
P.T. School bldg. H.M. agreed to £55 M. this year, on basis of dropping to
£50 M. next year. M/Ed. now want £55 M. next year and £60 M.
for year after.
There may be a moment later, after seeing Def. P’mme, when we can
see a prospect of expansion. At present, increased exp’re wd.
have to be matched by redns. elsewhere.
Before we can be great, we must be solvent.
Cost by loan and charges on educn. Vote – which has bn. growing faster
than most others.
A.L.B. Colonies’ need for technicians. If they have to get them fr. elsewhere,
English and our hold on Comm. will be lost thereby.
D.E. When I went to M/Ed., we were behind hand ; and with Cab. authy. I
roused p. opinion to need for expansion. They are ripe now to
demand it. Main social service wh. Con. Govt. shd. press.
Unless we get more spent now, standard of sec. educn. will be seen to
have fallen by next Genl. Election. Some counties won’t have
enough places – and will have to hold a propn. of children back in
primary schools.
R.A.B. Expansn. of new towns and housg. estates has made implementn. of my
Act much more expensive than we had supposed.
Denominations also need a little help.
If we do block grant, we must to somethg. else to show that education
is not slipping back.
Concentrate on improving link betwn. top of sec. schools and
40
| technical colleges. That is our weakest link. Gear his demands
x | to that plus denominations. That wdn’t cost much over next18
| months. Wd. match our drive for atomic expansion.
P.T. What do we cut back?
We haven’t saved yet. Mostly, new taxes or contns.
Educn. Estimates show increase of 1/6th. Pause before we give another
upward twist. Defer decn. until after Budget. M’while let M/Ed.
discuss with Ty. – ? on x/.
P.M. M’tain rules re prior discussion with Ty.
Distinguish betwn. cost and burden on economy (bldg. industry). We
have reduced that burden – Hail. referring to more rapid
completion. Study wtr capital investment wd. stand another £5 M.
Restrict any increase to 1 year : for thereafter wd. be affected by block grant.
