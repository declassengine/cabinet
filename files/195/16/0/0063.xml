C.C. 81 (57) 21st November, 1957

1. National Health Service: Pay Claim. [Enter E.H., D.W.S.
P.M. Asked to receive depn fr. body representing Whitley Councils in
N.H.S.
D.W.S. Wait until we can give answer on arbitn. point. Party think it wiser not
to refuse during ban on over-time.
P.T. W’in limits of M/H. and they shd. see Minister first.
P.M. Yes : mght on that a/c. seem weak for me to see them.
Agreed : Reply that they shd. see M/H. or S of S. Scotland “in
the first instance”.
[Exit D.W.S.
2. The Queen.
P.M. Read messages exchanged re celebration of 10th. anniversary of
wedding.
3. Bank Rate Enquiry.
P.M. Terms of disclosure to be made of Cabinet’s discussion on 17/9.
Permission of Sovereign will be required.
After discussion – approved.
4. Local Government Elections.
P.M. See no reason why Ministers, other than M/Housing and his Parly Secy,
shd. not accept invitations. Avoid appearance of intervening in
particular elections.
5. Ministers’ Visits Overseas.
P.M. Need for discretion – may be overdoing this a little. Avoid straining
hospitality of our hosts.
I can’t control this unless I am asked at an early enough point.
Ministers shd. not commit themselves too far before seeking my
consent.
This Xmas recess we shd. avoid too many absences. Bad if only few
were available when things go bad – e.g. late Jan. or early Feb.
230
H. Waste if 2 or more Ministers go abroad to same Comm. country at
same time.
H.W. Does this apply to junior Ministers. e.g. Signing agreemt. with
Quantas.
R.A.B. Important to consult well in advance.
D.S. Advantages in travel by Ministers with responsibilities – e.g. C.O. and
Services.
D.E. New fashion in trade promotion – e.g. German Minister.
P.M. Gives bad impression that it is all done in Recesses.
Agreed : P.M. to consider.
6. Parliament.
R.A.B. Motion to refer to Judicial Cttee. the report of Cttee. on Privileges.
Debate on report will follow, when advice of Judicial Cttee is available.
Hail. Development of privilege over last 15 years is not popular with the
public.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
Rhodesia : Monday : Alport and ALB. to spk.
7. Foreign Affairs.
S.Ll. a) Yemen. No profitable result from talks with Crown Prince.
b) Tunisia. Tripartite discussion in W’ton. We can’t give promise never
to supply w’out Fr. consent – tho’ we can promise to consult, as
we did.
P.M. Public opinion in Fr. is bad : but Govt. know they behaved foolishly.
P.M. c) France. I offered to meet Guillard on appointment. Have now agreed to
go on Mon. with S.Ll.
8. House of Lords Reform. [Enter Selkirk
H. Result of exploratory debate – indicates enough support for our
measure. Esp. if we assume H/L. will restrict attendance by its
own orders of procedure.
But S. will press for wider reform. This wd. provoke Socialists to
pledge themselves to abolition. Unwise to offer this provocation.
231
They are at 6’s and 7’s. They will find nominated Chamber wdn’t
do : they don’t want elected Senate : they may decide, faute de
mieux, to accept status quo, after our limited Bill.
K. Wider scheme is not acceptable to all members of Govt. or all
members of Tory Party in H/C. Wd. also provoke Labour.
But, if we don’t get limited reform, H/L. will “die on its feet.”
Two technical points:-
Bill as drafted won’t allow of amendmts in H/C. to allow Peer to
sit in H/C. in preference to H/L. – nor Peeresses in own right. i.e.
neither the reluctant heirs nor the anxious heiresses cd. be brght
in.
S. Don’t dissent in substance. But we are in favourable position – and we
are being pressed to go further in direction wh. most of us favour.
Can we look favourably on any amendmt. designed to strengthen
power of H/L. to control its own procedures – so as to give effect,
by order, to Swinton or Sal. limitn. of hereditary element.
H. Wd. excite opposn. of re-actionary Tory Peers. Wd. fear this. Prefer to
stand firm on limited plan.
Hail. Agree, reluctantly, that this is practical course. Can’t hope to get more
than this thro’ both Houses. Oppn. to anything which would
strengthen or confirm hereditary principle. Even if Parlt.
accepted it now, you wd. invite Labour Party to destroy it later.
Can’t put too much new wine into this v. old bottle.
Memo. approved.
9. Regent’s Park Terraces. [Enter H.M.
R.A.B. Fine Arts Commn are v. pleased and warmly welcome the plan.
Favour early statement. Will end the controversy.
Favourable to Ty. – because avoids guarantees.
Only demolitions are of v. little architectural merit.
H.M. V. satisfy. compromise. Will give experience – to see what can be
done.
Will satisfy public opinion.
Hope re-development will be in harmony with what is left.
H.B. Satisfied qua planning. Some minor amendmts. of wording agreed
with Eve
D.S. Object : preserve Terraces, despite planning arrangemts.
H.B. No : wd. aggravate those who want consent to get offices (planning
permission) in M’fair.
232
P.T. Keep that issue open for the time.
Memo. approved. [Exit H.M.
10. British Honduras.
ALB. Delegn. here. Head of it is in touch with Guatemala, on basis of
secession. Have charged him – to other members – with
treasonable activities. Intend to send this Delegn. home, indicatg.
readiness to discuss business with a more responsible party. at a
later date.
Possibility of disorder. A Br. company is there : a frigate can be
available.
I may have to disclose facts which will lead to pressure to remove
Guatemalan Minister.
S.Ll. His removal wd. do more harm than good.
G.Ll. Guatemalan Govt. shd. be creature of State Dpt. Can’t they help?
S.Ll. They can’t do much.
Note taken of position.
11. Cyprus.
S.Ll. Must settle instructions to our Delegn. to U.N. Must avoid intervention
of Sec. Genl. or a U.N. Confce. Cd. promise to keep U.N.
informed.
Must start talks with Turks. To enhance impn. of diplomatic activity.
So as to get us thro’ U.N. Debate.
When do we let Cttee. (Human Rights) go to Cyprus? Can we give the
body diplomatic immunity – by Order requiring Parly. approval.
P.M. Put the Order thro’ on a quiet day – as a consolidating measure.
Delay decision to allow (timing) Cttee. to go to Cyprus – as they are
asking to cover atrocities in same visit.
H. Spaak’s plan or Averoff’s. Cdn’t have Cyprus in Commonwealth, as
independent, for a defined term of years.
P.M. Agree it cdn’t be fully independent.
