C.C. 11 (57) 15th February, 1957

1. Rent Restriction Bill. [Enter E.H.
H.B. As in memo.
D.S. This accords with conclns. which I had reached.
Agree tht. posn. will not be as bad as some fear. Tho’ there will
be some cases of exploitn. by l’lords.
Agree also tht. premium must be prohibited.
There may be pressure to increase period fr. 3 to 4 or 5 yrs. Wdn’t
move yet on that. Minister’s’ proposals are fair balance.
Hail. Recommn. (d). Does this mean minimum period of notice after the 15
months. Hope so. For common law provns. for a week’s notice
works hardly.
Prohibition of premiums. Give man who has paid the power to
recover.
H.B. My proposal is transitional only. Permanent change in law wd. be
landlord/tenant problem. I will discuss with Ld. Chanc. wtr
amendmt. cd. be made in this Bill.
P.M. Consider doing it by stages – first for this area of de-control only.
I.M. Doubt. Are we going to far? Political dates : Lewisham/Gnl. Electn.
These proposals will be taken as our re-action to Lewisham. We
shd. say at once tht. principle of Bill holds, but we will try to
smooth transition.
On para. 10 (a) 12 mos. vice 15? (b) Agree. (c) Accept the arguments ;
but, if so, (d) make the 6 mos. notice applicable after 9 of 15
mos. have run. If (d) stands…….. Drop my point on (d) – on
expln. tht. notice can be given after 9 mos.
D.S. 15 mos. is about minimum if you want it to go smoothly.
H.B. Don’t think it will seem weak. Surveyors have recommended 18.
Valuation office think that market will settle at 2 – 2½ times
gross value generally and 2½ – 3 times in Ldn.
Procedure : was disposed to do these amendmts. on Report. Now
inclined to terminate argument by passing them in Cttee. Wd.
announce them on Tues. and table them for discussion on
followg. Tuesday.
Ch.H. Govt. will get credit for doing it in proper course w’out reference to
Lewisham.
Agreed : Go on with Bill - and re-affirm it at once.
Ammendmts. as proposed.
50
Procedure – in proper course of Bill : Ch. Whip and
M/H. and L.G. to decide at what stage in Cttee. – not
to wait till Rpt.
[? Exit E.H.
2. Farm Price Review.
H.A. My personal judgmt. is tht. any settlement below £15 M. wd. destroy
credit with farmers wh. we have secured by long-term
assurances.
This wd. give increase of 1.5% in selling prices. Modest cpd. with
industry.
Previous awards over 3 years, for roughly same increases, have bn.
much higher than £8M.
Long-term assurances weren’t designed to allow for tougher reviews,
but to facilitate long-term planning.
Gap of £7M. Not a high price to pay for continued good will.
Good hope tht. costs won’t rise again next year.
Schedule (as submitted) wd. mean we were not m’taining profitability
on any of items when we want to m’tain or increased prodn. –
barley, beet, sheep and beef, wool. Wd. have liked more than £2
on fertilisers.
I wd. therefore prefer to argue case for £8M., leave farmers to ask for
more, and see how it goes – w’out putting in detailed schedule at
this stage.
P.T. We must appear to be gripping financial sitn.
Not inherent in long-term assurances tht. we never award minimum.
This forces prodn. by adding price increases to normal increase of
efficiency.
We shall have to impose a settlement. Commend therefore para 14 of
earlier memo.
£8 M. honours our obligns. in full. Rather more because assumes
increased oil costs will continue throughout year. £4½ M. for
that.
We also give £5M. rate, for 1st. time, for capital investment : say £3 M.
this yr
Also £13 M. extra in real cost of subsidy to Ty. – on existg basis
All told this means £24 M. increase over last year in real cost. Wipes
out, and more, all proposed saving on school meals and milk.
L.P. Political problem. We are planning action wh. will discourage various
sections of our supporters. This will upset farmers. Diffce.
betwn. M/Ag. and P.T. = £7 M . Is it worth it? V. large block of
pol. opinion is involved.
D.E. Posn. on oats and barley. We are near to exportg. now.
H.A. We import v. large amounts of dollar barley.
51
P.M. Read note of R.A.B.’s views.
J.M. Sc. farmers have not h’to opened their mouths as wide as English. But
fear that, if we don’t give more than £8M., their N.F.U. will
become as powerful as the English.
H. Wd. like less encouragemt. to milk and more to barley and oats.
Ch.H. Merits – with P.T. But on politics, we have achieved transformn. of
agric. opinion. That gain will be lost if in 1st. year we award
minimum. And we shall get charges of bad faith.
P.T. Can’t we plead financial diffy. If any year is one in which minimum is
x| justified, this is it.
H.A. Agree to start like that. But don’t want, by submittg schedule, to close
door to doing a penny more.
P.M. Start by taking general line of x/.
| Don’t submit detailed schedule.
y| Keep it in mind we may have to go a bit above.
| But reserve right to do it on price schedule – on merits of
| individual commodities not on total. £2 M. in that way wd. be
| defensible.
P.T. But I know no commodity whose increased prodn. in U.K. won’t do
more harm than good to b/p.
If we have to do anything for farmers, I wd. sooner consider a tariff on
meat.
Agreed : As first step, proceed as at y/.
D.E. Wd. prefer to give money to small men – e.g. subsidy on first x gallons
of milk, while cutting back general price.
H.A. That wd. discriminate v. efficient producers. Have then no justificn.
for subsidy in general.
P.M. After initial start as at y/. consider alternatives: –
i) Schedule with another £2 M or so.
ii) Bribes to small men.
iii) Meat tariff.
[Enter D.V., Att.G.
3. Remuneration of Doctors.
D.V. As in memo.
Att.G. T. of Reference. Para. (b) “principles” v. dangerous. Dankwerts. Wd.
prefer to omit 1st. sentence of (b).
52
P.T. I agree. Am also v. doubtful about (c). Don’t want periodical reviews.
Hail. But disadvantages of havg. every review a pol. ques.
D.V. Accept suggn. on (b). Want (c) to get away from Spens. and to parallel
C.S. Cttee. Also (c) is what will sell it to doctors.
I.M. Favour (c). Decisions wd. be reserved to Govt.
H.B. “Keep that remuneration under review” – Agreed.
Att.G. On (a) – ‘having regard to’ vice ‘in comparison with’.
R.C. shd. also have power clearly to look at comparative diffces. w’in
profession.
(1) Agreed : P.T. with Heath Ministers and Att.G. to go over terms of
reference again : and refer to P.M.
L.P. Whatever amendment of (b) is made, R.C. won’t escape discussion of
principles.
Pre-clinical workers. As in memo. May Health Ministers and I
examine and submit a memo.
P.M. Bring in also repve. of Universities.
Att.G. Case for legal Chairman.
P.M. I will settle composition.
P.M.
CLOSED UNDER THE
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT 2000
[Exit L.P. Att.G. Home.
4. Government Expenditure.
P.M. Choices : (1) abandon prospect of substantial redn.
(2) go for N.H.S. contribution.
If (2) is accepted, pol. ques of timing –
(3) can we say that N.I. adjustments must wait another
year; or must we face comprehensive legn. prob. next
session.
53
In discussion – general agreemt. to adhere to (2).
P.M. Amount : what about doubling it : 1/5d. for man and 3d. for employer :
total 1/8
P.T. Favour that – simplest, and also middle course.
H.A. 1/6th vice 1/12th. But don’t present it as final step.
P.M. No. Power to vary amount by order.
P.M. Problem remains wtr this shd. be done separately or together with
adjustment of N.I. benefits and contrn.
B.C. Diff. to settle amount for N.H.S. w’out knowg. what increase we may
have to make on N.I. Must know what total, if we are to judge
wtr it is tolerable.
Pressure for improvement – matter of judgemt. wtr it can be resisted.
To-day’s figures of retail prices make my memo. out of date : we
are now even lower by comparison with ’46. Posn. will be
increasingly diff., even if prices don’t move up.
Fear that, if we do this, we shall lose initiative.
Wise course wd. be to time increased contns. with increased N.I.
benefits. On timing, I wd. be inclined to wait for favourable
moment. Had hoped to defer until next Session.
P.T. Have considered with B.C.
We must get some contn. to this year’s Budget. Stamp (now) is only
practicable method.
Had bn hoped previously to hold N.I. rates until c/living rose to 108.
H.B. Increase shd. take effect (N.H.S.) before Oct. (because of rents).
P.M. To get it home that this separate, we must do it alone and soon.
But prs. in autumn we cd. get N.I. Bill – with frills to offset Labour
Party plans.
B.C. * Still fear that this action will make if imposs. to hold N.I. rates until
autumn.
H.A. Food Stocks. Def. Cttee. shd. re-consider level. Now meets neither
* one policy nor another.
[Exit D.V., B.C.
5. Steel Industry.
P.M. Read P.T.’s minute.
Ty. want to authorise sale of S. Co. of Wales.
54
No oblign. qua development. Ques : political. Is it better to go
on twds. Completion of our policy.
M. Technical arguments are all in favour of going fwd.
P.T. ⅓rd. (equities) will be sold : but ⅔rds. (deb. : preferred) will be held by
Agency. Tho’ latter wd. eventually be sold at par.
D.E. Cd. some of debentures be convertible into equities. Wd. be a hedge
against re-nationalisation.
M. But that wd .make it more diff. to sell equities.
6. Yemen.
D.S. At. S.Ll.’s request, aircraft have bn. prohibited fr. acting across
frontier.
Want to be clear tht. artillery can engage forts across border.
Agreed.
7. Parliament.
E.H. Debate Tuesday on Cyprus.
P.M. A.L.B. and Under Secy.
