C.C. 61(57). 2nd August, 1957.

1. Cabinet Procedure. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Arrangements for Aug. and Sept.
2. Commercial Policy : European Free Trade Area.
P.M. Appointment of Maudling to give whole time to this for time being –
with separate office and a small staff.
To be announced at middle of next week.
3. Civil Aviation.
a) Sales to Egypt.
D.E. On 4/6 Sale of Arms Cttee. decided tht. 2 Viscounts be sold to Egypt.
Paymt. thro’ Special A/c. No appln. to B/T. for export permits.
Doubt wisdom of this – while Br. claims on E. are un-settled.
P.T. Shd. have bn. referred to a Minister. But decision is probably right.
We are not putting embargo on trade with E. Think our line shd
be : let them buy what they want.
P.M. Let a memo. be circulated. Ty. to take the lead. [P.M. cd. settle?]
b) Sale of Brittania Aircraft to U.S.
H.W. Needs consideration. Mainly for M/Supply. But risk : Brittania isn’t
right yet – and mght be said aircraft is a flop. Play this down.
Leave it to B.O.A.C. and B’tol Aircraft.
P.M. Keep an eye on this – M/T. and M/S.
4. Pensions.
R.A.B. Time-table. Payments by end/Jan. simultaneously with N.A. rates.
23/xi is not v. firm because in view of incln. of tobacco
concession it will be more controversial.
B.C. 25/xi is latest date for beginning to call in pension books.
Incln. of provn. re tobacco wd. involve Ways and Means resoln.
Can’t guarantee tht. N.A. Board will be able to wait until end/Jan.
Time-table approved.
184
Amounts.
R.A.B. 10/= and 17/6 (assumg. a graduated scheme will follow).
P.T. Support this.
I.M. Can’t do more than one rise in this Parlt. Must last for 2 yrs. from this
autumn. The 10/= is only 7/8 to 50% of pensioners. 4/2 has
already gone. Will 3/6 be enough to last the 2 years.
H.A. Agree there is this risk. But I wd. accept 10/=.
H.B. Diff. to justify a rise as large as 12/=
D.E. Immedte. need is to prevent wage increases. 12/= mght appear to be a
hedge v. inflation. Safer to give 10/=
P.M. Argument of appearing to hedge v. inflation is v. strong.
Agreed : 10/= and w’drawal of tobacco concession, and
17/6.
Graduated Scheme.
R.A.B. Wd. wish for decision in principle in favour of graduated scheme.
People under £8 wd. pay less, and those over wd. pay more, than
now. Over £8 you pay 8% of earnings.
Contractg. out wd. cost £50 M. and wd. be v. difficult administratively.
Wd. be necessary to make adjustments e.g. as suggd. in para 7.
But this wd. mean tht. lower-paid wd. pay proportionately than
higher-paid. May well be found tht. contracting-out is
impossible.
B.C. No serious work yet done on contracting-out. Wd. wish to do this.
There is a case on merits for not applying graduated principle to
sickness or unemplt. benefit.
Crossman provides for contracting-out. Diff. for us to be harder on
private industry.
Graduated scheme will not be v. popular. No advantage to Ty until
1960. Hasn’t the merit of looking like a Tory plan.
M. Contractg. out is essential.
Govt. graduated scheme will damage v. seriously existing
supplementary schemes in industry.
P.M. Suggest we now work out graduated scheme. Study contracting-out.
Decide that we want to have a graduated scheme, if it can be done. We
want to see two plans – one with contractg. out and one without.
