CC. 4 (57) 29th January, 1957

1. Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. [Enter Att.G., J.H., E.H.
S.Ll. No official informn. from E. Govt. so far.
Att.G. E. are entitled to take view tht. our action abrogated the treaty. Title to
property (moveable) in Base wd. not, however, be affected.
Can’t reconcile paras. 3 and 10 of memo. I wd. favour contending that
Agreemt. is still in force.
S.Ll. I don’t support proposals in para. 3. Treaty won’t help us to get any
fresh concession in future. Don’t therefore recommend that we
shd. argue that Treaty is not terminated.
P.M. x/ We take note of fact tht. E. have terminated Treaty – and we accept
that.
P.T. Base employees cost us £90.000 p.m. and the Cos. £35.000 p.m.
Sooner we can escape these liabilities, the better.
P.M. 1) F.O. and Att. G. to settle form of words on x/.
2) Give notice at once to employees, and terminate contracts with
contractors’ companies.
L.P. Final para. of L.O.D. shd. be further considered, in case E. raises it.
[P.M.] 3) F.O. and L.O.’s to consider point in final para.
[Exit J.H., Att.G.
[Enter B.C.
2. Suez Canal : British Refugees.
R.A.B. Anglo-Eg. Cttee. admit they can’t do this. Propose to set up a new
Board Chairman : Reading or Colyton or Collisford. A Labour
Peer (?Listowel) as Member. Staff from C. Service (M/L, or
N.A.Bd.)
Grants : £6 single £10 married £1 for each child
Other problems : a) education of children. M/Ed.
b) (E.) pensions. H.O. and Ty.
c) E. currency – worthless now. H.O. and Ty.
S.Ll. Distinguish between relief of hardship and longer-term future of them
all. We shd. treat generously because their misfortunes are due to
our own act. Otherwise we shall have serious pol. trouble.
Examples : Pensioners : people whose furniture was sold in
Cairo.
P.T. Agree tht., for small sums, we cd. avoid big political difficulties.
Agreed : Appoint Bd. with Colyton as Chairman.
23
I.M. There will be residual problem of unemploymt. and housing, esp. for
Maltese.
D.E. Compensation for loss. Claimants have their eyes on E. sterling
balances. Hope therefore one list of claims, wtr for domestic or
for commercial property. Claims will exceed the £100 M. of E.
balances. Shall have to do somethg on lines of Enemy Property
settlement.
P.M. E. will make v. large claim r. us for damage. We shall put in a
counter-claim. That will be argued for a long time.
This Bd. shd. deal only with human side – not the big commercial
losses.
[Exit B.C.
3. Rent Restrictions.
Note not taken.
4. Israel : U.N. Debate.
S.Ll. Outlined plans for handling this in N.Yk.
P.M. After manoeuvring there will be mammoth resoln. In latter part, it may
contain somethg. constructive. But it will prob. start by
deprecating I. action. If we abstain, we help no-one. If we vote
for it, we shall upset I. If we vote against it, we lose value of
constructive element and risk trouble with Arabs and oil.
L.P. We cdn’t be expected to vote against. We ourselves obeyed U.N.
behest. But wd. be v. helpful if we cd. get included some
reference to U.N. troops. We mght then be able to support. At
worst, we cd. abstain – because we have always said somethg in
I.’s case.
S.Ll. Abstention wd. have bad effect on Arabs.
P.M. | If resoln. did no more than blame I., we cd. abstain. If it contained
x | constructive elements, I wd. hope we cd. support – with
| explications de vote.
P.T. Fresh outbreak of hostile Arab re-actions cd. be v. awkward for
sterling.
K. If it’s reasonable resoln. we shd. vote in favour.
Agreed : general view is at x/
P.M. to decide when text is available.
24
Cab., in general, favoured vote in favour.
5. Wales : Administration.
H.B. Report of Council – publd. Friday.
Accept view of officials tht. adminn. on Sc. model wd. be a mistake.
Popn. only 2½m. cpd. with 5m in Scotland. Costly, inefficient
and not in interests of Wales.
But admit we haven’t reached finality on co-ordinn.
Transfer to M/H and L.G. has bn. welcomed in Wales. No ill-will.
But Council’s plan is popular in W. Press.
Recommend : reject plan for S of S. with executive
responsibility.
consider time and method of announcement. I wd. favour not
announcg. before debate.
K. Support adminve. grounds for H.B.’s recommn.
I favoured soln. by wh. M/Welsh Affairs was Chairman of Cttee.
comprising Ministers for Dpts concerned with offl. Cttee. below
it. (H and LG., Health, Educn., H.O.)
If this cd. be set up and made public, good effect in Wales. Cd. general
rule v. announcg. Cab Cttees. be departed from for this?
Adminve. devolutions shd. continue. 1) Under Sec., Wales, for M/Ag.
is now to be given more status and staff. This will help.
2) Education. Pressure for Head of Welsh Dpt. to live in
Cardiff – tho’ adminve. arguments are v. it.
On timing, agree with H.B.
Hail. Adminn. of educn. being l.a. function, there is devolution. The pressure for
our man to be based in Cardiff does not come from educational
opinion in Wales – but fr. pol. opinion in N. Wales.
P.M. 1) No intention to apply Scottish system to Wales.
2) No announcement before debate.
3) Minister to consider wtr small adm. changes shd. be announced at
end of debate or afterwards. Or some then and others later. My
own preference wd. be to resist main claim in debate and announce
concessions later.
Agreed (1) and (2). Tactics to be considered later.
6. Bermuda Meeting.
P.M. No statement shd. be made yet on what follows.
On 23/1 President suggested we mght meet – in W’ton or B’muda. I
accepted – specially pleased at B’muda.
E. intended to ask Mollet to W’ton in Feb. B’muda Mar 21/24.
Read his reply to E.
25
Fr. wanted announcemt. p’poned until 10/2, after debate on Algeria.
But y’day, leakage began fr. W’ton. We have therefore asked for
earlier mtg. U.S. will now explain position frankly in Paris.
Fr. may press for tri-partite : may not like differentiation betwn. them
and French. If necessary to appease Fr., I wd. go to Paris after
Mollet’s visit to W’ton.
7. Germany: Support Costs.
P.M. Costs £57M. across exchanges. We asked for £55. They have
offered £45M.
Discussed with P.T. and S.Ll. Think we must close as quickly as poss.
Propose to instruct our repve. to try for £50M. but to accept a little
less if he can’t get it e.g. £48M.
[Enter Perth.
[Re-enter RAB.
8. Cyprus.
P. Govr. wants to send up to 30 more prs. to U.K.
R.A.B. We will do our best. May I discuss nos. with C.O.
9. Local Government Finance.
R.A.B. As in memo.
P.T. Only way of obtaining economy in l. govt is block grant system.
Particular grants are incentive to extravagance.
On re-rating, I still think immediate decision wd. be shock to industry.
But it wd. be 12 mos. before it took effect – and we cd. prepare
the ground, incldg. putting industry in better tax posn. to stand it.
K. Agree with P.T. No. progress twds economy w’out block grant. On
balance I also favour re-rating.
Co-opn. with l.a.’s is good. But we must a) improve quality of l.a.
members : re-rating and block grant wd. help. b) get greater
interest by electorate : wider powers wd. help.
I.M. Part of P.T.’s major pattern.
Admit that J.S. arguement con. was impressive.
J.M. I am greatly disturbed. Block grant for Scotl. wd be £36½M. and of
this £33M. wd be for education, of wh. 50% wd. be for salaries.
Thus it wd. not give them increased control.
This plan may upset both l.a.’s and industry.
26
Hail. Strong educational interest in block grant. This plan wd. be regarded
as an attack on education : all educational authies., incldg.
teachers, wd. be against it.
Specific grants wd. be retained for many services, incldg. housing.
Educn. wd. be linked with job-lot of other services.
Educn. represents 85% of exp’re on services to be covered by g. grant.
Policy must be in close control of Dpt. Their power of control over
policy will be reduced. The popular parts of the service (e.g.
transport to school) will be continued and other more important
parts will be skimped.
D.E. Supported. Expansion of educn. is main plank in our domestic p’mme.
Can’t leave so much discretion to l.a.’s.
Diff. method for economy. Improved methods of accounting and costs
comparison.
Don’t believe block grant wd. improve quality of Educn. Cttees. or offrs.
Gt. political disadvantages.
Re-rating. I wd. oppose this unless part of new general fiscal policy
for industry.
H.A. Agree with D.E. generally.
Think we cd. do re-rating.
Block grant : sound in theory, but I doubt if it’s practicable.
If we have to do this, shall need to work hard to mobilise Tory support.
H.B. Right and imperative. Mistaken to suppose it will be unpopular in l.a.
circles. Will in fact be popular with our supporters.
Not a right move if we mean to expand educn. But this is not a good
moment to run that regardless of expense.
Figures in para. 3 are surely decisive. We can’t stand this increase. If
we don’t go for block grant, we shall have to reduce percentage
grants.
Even educationalists will welcome relaxn. of detailed control Will
reduce Whitehall control.
Add. i) Rating and Valn. Bill has bn. published. Re-action in l. govt.
circles that this doesn’t make sense except r. b’ground of rerating.
ii) £89M. will be needed vice £73M. in memo. Block
grant is only means of exercising control.
H. Ceiling on l.a. exp’re is essential ; and I see no other method.
C.H. Convinced M/H and L.G. is right. Attempt to control exp’re and to widen
scope for independent decision by l.a.’s.
Ty. share of re-rating, as proposed in memo., will be resented by l.a.’s.
If 4/5
ths. is to be taken by Ty., gt. controversy over that will
obscure the whole.
H.B. That wd. be for discussion with l.a.’s.
27
£85 M. now andamp; good prospect of a 2nd. instalment in autumn we might be all right.
