C.C. 42 (57) 22nd May, 1957

1. Steel : Location of New Works. [Enter E.H., O.G.
J.M. Special circs. In past all responsible Sc. newspp. have bn. stressing
prospects of unemplt. in Sc. V. real cause for anxiety. These are
circs. in wh. anxiety is felt about location of new strip mill. This
is case for receiving all Party deputn. which wishes to wait on
P.M. Out side deputns. have bn. recd. by me, B/T. and M/P. Their
argument for seeing P.M. is tht. various Dpts. are concerned.
M. I have had depns. fr. Sc. M.P.’s – also from Welsh interests. It is a steel
works as well as a strip mill. Co., after examining various Sc.
sites, prefer Newport.
If P.M. sees a Sc. deputn., he can’t refuse to receive depns. fr. E. and W.
Wales and also fr. Lincs.
D.E. On social grounds W. Wales (because of declining plate works) has
best case. But industrially it is the worst site. We must, in view
of importance of expanding steel prodn., be guided by economic
considerations – esp. access to ports.
P.M. Govt. can’t stand aside : for apart from negative D.I. control, we own
the shares and have Iron and Steel Board.
P.T. Scale of this project puts it in a class apart.
P.M. I think I had better see M.P.’s (not outside interests) – from Scotland and
|* Wales (2 sides). Wales : Scotland : Wales – in that order :
| Ch. Whip to make arrangements. Agreed.
M/Power to co-ordinate prepn. of briefs.
[Exit J.M.
2. Parliament.
R.A.B. a) Business for next week.
b) Amended Bill. Norfolk will come to see me. Tho’ a private Bill,
we must decide which Dpt. shd. watch it. Will have it examined
in H.O. and report on this, after consultn. with Ty.
c) Whitsun Recess. Plan to have 14 days. Approved.
3. House of Lords Reform.
R.A.B. If this session, Bill wd. have to start in H/Lds. One clause with 4 subsections.
Shd. have to start it on 23/5 in H/Lds. It cd. then come
to H/C. for 2nd. Rdg. on 15/16 July. Wd. need two days on 2nd.
Rdg : 1 day in Cttee. (23/7) : no time for Rpt after 29/7 unless
after 10.p.m.
126
Diffies. of this time-table i) appearance of rush ii) risk of spilling over.
H. Despite advantages of package deal, we cdn’t go as fast as that. Shd.
need, e.g., to consult Queen.
Believe (after consultn. with Salisb.) I can defer debate until spill-over.
K. Reluctant to abandon package approach. Believe we still cd. do it,
even waiting for consultn. with Queen. We have waited 47 years
for this. Pity to miss it now.
E.H. Great risk in doing this so late in session.
Agreed : Defer debate in H/Lds. until late in spill-over.
4. Nigeria.
A.L.B. In 1953 O.L. guaranteed tht. regional self-govt. wd. be granted in 1956
to any region which asked for it. Conference (p’poned fr. 1956
because of Zik) now being held. E. and W. seek it now : the N.
seek it in ’59.
Shall do my utmost to protect minority and other interests.
In view of date now suggd. by N., it will be more difficult to deny or to
stall on federal self-government.
Further note not taken.
5. Education : Training of Teachers.
Hail. Size of classes has bn. main problem in schools – for many years past.
Limits prescribed can’t be observed because shortage of teachers
and bldgs. We ought not however to fall behind in this for lack of
money.
Further note not taken.
P.M. Is this best way of spending money available?
Hail. I am sure of that. 3 year course is a money-saver, whenever
introduced.
RAB 3 yrs. is period already in force in Sc. and N.I. Support M/E. on this.
D.E. Refresher course of 1 year may be better – because wastage, esp. of
women.
R.A.B. Teachers are gravely concerned at block grant. We shd. put no further
burden of defence on M/Ed.
127
P.M. Think we must go to 3 year-course. Only ques is wtr it shd. be done in
’59 or ’60.
Agreed : Defer for further discussion – on clearer picture of dates.
H.B. M’while examine para. 6, which seems fallacious.
I.M. No : it is correct.
6. Civil Aviation: Viscounts for Turkey.
H.W. i) Overflying in T. is important; ii) Better to have B.O.A.C. than U.S.
line as ancillary to Turkish line. iii) Can’t press BOAC to put
still more money into the equities: they wd. sooner drop the plan.
P.T. Pity BOAC didn’t discuss with us earlier.
Para 7. I wd. deprecate a). Course b) wd. suit Ty. but wd. damnify
other commercial creditors.
D.E. Course b) wd. be indefensible. Tho’, if creditors aren’t paid, Br.
taxpayer will pay [90%] thro’ E.C.G.D. Tho’ latter have not
covered recent new business with T.
O.G. Oppose (c) because we always regarded this as a business deal. We
don’t advocate it as a political gesture alone.
The T. line shd. make money and be able to repay the loan.
P.M. We must get this concluded. I would risk (b) – and see what we cd. do
if in the event commercial creditors are in fact damnified.
P.T. x/ Camouflage this by making it “subject to payment of debts”.
Agreed : Approve para 7 (b) plus x/.
7. Suez Canal : Use by Warships.
D.S. Br. merchant ships are going thru’. U.S. will shortly pass a warship
thro’. Wish to plan on basis we start with R. Fleet Auxiliary in
June (final decision 6/6) and follow with frigate in mid-July. This
decision wd. be subject to review, in light of developmts., up to
6/6.
O.G. Suggest we notify E. some days ahead. To avoid a row while ship is at
Suez.
P.M. V. diff. posn. if refused.
Feel your way. Start with R.N. Auxiliary. Don’t risk a warship yet.
Notify Canal authority – or comply with past procedure.
128
Further Cab. decision before a warship is committed.
