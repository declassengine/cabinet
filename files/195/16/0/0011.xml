C.C. 9(57). 7th February, 1957. 5.30 p.m.

Enter E.H.
1. Jordan.
2. Germany : Support Costs.
3. Local Government Finance.
Draft statement considered, para. by para.
R.A.B. Para. 2. Strengthen by giving some figures. 504 Exch. 420 Rates.
With an indicn. of progressive increase over last decade.
J.M. Not clear how alternative central control will be secured under block
grant.
R.A.B. Will mean control by direction instead of by w’holding grant.
P.M. How often do you in fact w’hold grant.
Hail. Shall have to make more use of power of direction. Financial control is
more flexible.
P.M. Para 3. Mention minor exceptns., if there are any.
D.S. Para. 4. Don’t say “immediate” of somethg. wh. takes effect only in
1961. Some warning shd. be given tht. l.a.’s won’t get all the
money.
P.M. Shall also be asked wtr re-rating is to stand at 50% – or wtr it is to go on
up to 100%. Can we say : this is our plan – 50%.
P.T. “raise from 25% to 50%.”
J.M. How much will l.a.’s get out of re-rating.
P.T. V. little. Don’t mind some warning tht. they won’t get it all.
P.M. Give some expln. : a subsidy to industry in slump, and Ty. compensated
l.a.’s. And say tht. in final settlement this must be brght into a/c.
R.A.B. Final settlement can’t be reached until agric. is re-rated : and we mght
then go above 50%.
P.M. Can’t be too precise : but draft of para. 5 is too vague. Indicate that
there is this problem, but don’t say what is ultimate solution.
42
H.B. Yes – will re-consider para. 5. But don’t want to recall 1929.
P.T. Is there a case for going to 100%.
D.E. Easier to do these things in 1 bite than 2.
M. Don’t do that unless tax concession to industry.
P.M. Make it clear tht. block grant applies to all services save those to which
it is inapplicable for technical reasons.
H.B. Para. 6. Suggd. re-draft of final sentence.
P.M. Make point tht. it is designed to give vigorous and independent life to
l.a.’s. Rather than appear to be encouraging cheese-paring.
J.M. Para 7. Add S of S. Scotland (re roads).
Interim statement on Rating Bill 2nd. Rdg. – approved.
Hail. Believe this posn. will be v. hard to hold.
Relns. with l.e.a.’s will be worsened – and I haven’t yet won their
confidence.
Have Cab. appreciated strength of opposition.
D.E. Fear it may not be tenable.
All modern tendencies are twds. central control of education.
H.B. Tory opinion in l. govt. will welcome this.
L.G. offrs (save educn. officers) will support it.
H.A. Fear expected results won’t accrue. Too late to re-vitalise l. govt.
Believe they must turn into agents of central Govt. Believe this is
an effort for a cause already lost.
J.M. Dislike both parts of proposal. Fear boomerang. Tory opinion in
Scotland will be indifferent. Educationalists will dislike.
H.B. Co. Councils Assocn. will prob. welcome this.
R.A.B. Burden of exp’re is too great. This helps to bring it under control.
Education. Divide betwn. investment and other exp’re (on which there is
extravagance). If we don’t have block grant, we shd. have to face
even more unpopular revision of percentage grants.
Major Bill – for next session. Will crowd out a lot of others.
D.S. Must stress tht. this is aimed at i) economy, thro’ increased financial
independence to l.a.’s. ii) reality for invigoration of l. govt. This
will give impact to help it thro’. More stress on ii) in statement.
43
R.A.B. Mght be exception for technical education.
P.M. Prefer to confine exceptions to those wh. can’t on technical grds. be
included. Otherwise, door is open – and you have admitted that
specific grants are better than general.
P.T. Must be able to show we are takg. steps to bring exp’re under control.
Agreed : Proceed accordingly.
4. Rent Restriction Bill. [Enter Home
P.M. Are we to promise specific concession on Cl. 9.
5. Legislative Programme. [Exit H.B.
L.P. Bills started in H/Lds. Films : Shops.
Dpts. have said no amendments to be accepted in H/Lds. Can’t wear
that.
R.A.B. Am arranging for some to be done in H/Lds.
