C.C. 50 (57) 9th July, 1957

1. Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers. [Enter E.H., Strathc
P.M. Success – in sense that those attendg. thght it so.
Fewer set speeches.
M. a tower of strength. N. friendly and relaxed. N/S. duel : but better
twds. end and a useful talk with the 2 together. B. a man of gt.
character – tho’ still in mood of Election : his wish for Comm.
Econ. Conference – he had some support from us w’out wh. he
wd. have got nothg. at all.
Clear they prefer to come to Ldn. Rotation is out. They mght on
occasion meet in Ottawa.
No recrimination over Suez : Genl. recognn. tht. posn. in M/E. has
improved.
x/ Press wd. like to be hostile : but our visitors will give opposite
impression.
H. Endorse x/. Some firmer characters – B. and Mac and S.
P.M.’s guidance – summing-up – generally welcomed.
N. was spkg. from weakness : didn’t go too far. S. went away with
less suspicion of U.K. N.K. was impressed.
S.Ll. Menon has stayed behind – to see a no. of Ministers. He evidently
thinks tht. this has bn. surprisingly successful.
R.A.B. One point for elucidation. Party doesn’t know where it stands on trade.
Diffies. over European : P.M.’s refce. to Comm. coming first. We
ought to explain how the 2 things mesh in.
D.E. Trade and Ind. Cttee. of Party are to see me this week. We must find a
means of mtg D.’s initiative wh. is mainly on Canada’s triangular
trade. Am considering this.
2. Foreign Affairs.
S.Ll. a) Iran. Earthquake. We shd. provide tents and surgical team.
b) Soviet Union. Old guard has bn. eliminated from centre – not clear
what their remaining strength in bureaucracy etc., F.O. view is
that K.’s geniality may be more dangerous to us than Mol.’s
obstinacy. N. takes opp. view – tht. this will mean more liberal
outlook in R.
What attitude to M.P. visits to R.? Those who are going are v.
unrepresentative. Prs. we shd. ensure that some more predictable
people go.
P.M. Invitns. to individual Members. Better to channel it thro’ inter-Party
Union.
147
P.T. We shall be in trouble if we appear to be trying to stop people going.
You cdn’t defend policy of actively discouraging visits.
P.M. Take the line of doing nothing one way or another – leave it to
individuals.
S.Ll. c) Disarmament.
All of us save Stassen think Zorrin’s reply is wholly negative. But it
may not be their last word.
Debate in H/C. – allow it to come later, next wk. or followg : to avoid
two debates, before summer recess.
Fear R. line will be to offer immedte. cessation of tests. And Br.
opinion may build up in favour of that. We shall have to stress
the link betw. that and cessation of manufacture.
3. Cyprus.
P.M. Have had consultn. with Harding. No decns. reached. Will come to
Def. Cttee. Wed., and Cab. on Thurs. Newspaper speculn. is
unfounded. May cause Opposn. to ask for debate.
4. Ireland.
R.A.B. de Valera has acted suddenly and well. Things are going pretty well.
Leave it to de Valera. B. Brooke may want to see P.M. Danger
now is retaliation by N. Ireland.
[Enter A.J., G.W.
5. Royal Ordnance Factories.
A.J. Excess capacity – has existed for some time. Mistake to wait until def.
p’mme is finally settled. Close 5 now : more when p’mmes are
completed. Second step cd. then be taken in spring.
This announcemt. will cause some pol. diffy. Labour Party will press
for retention and civil work. This isn’t practicable save on v. small
scale. a) where nucleus must be held but isn’t fully employed.
b) where private capacity is fully employed.
P.T. Support this. This is an effect of disinflationary policy – mustn’t rush
to mitigate its effects.
P.M. Actual closings are spread over 2 years. Do you need to announce it
all at once? Why not announce separately as you go along –
starting with first three.
A.J. Much speculation about some e.g. Dalmuir. Want to allay talk.
148
Str. Timing of announcemt. needs thght. Of 1st. 3, 2 are in Scotland. No
announcemt. re Dalmuir before we can say who will take it over.
A.J. Can’t avoid some public statement if there is debate in H/C. on
R.O.F.’s
Str. Diff. to get general picture of effects in Scotland of changes in def.
p’mmes.
I.M. Diffies. about 2 of these 5., on labour grounds. Labour considns., tho’
assessed, have bn. over-ruled. We shall have trouble with
Swynnerton Irvine will be less diff. if we don’t de-schedule N.
Ayrshire). S. is in potteries : high unemplt. percentage: will be
increased by this. Any prospect of civil firm taking it on? If not,
can we do somethg fiscally for pots. industry.
A.J. But Swynnerton is the worst of filling factories.
M. Civil work. Attempted on large scale post-war. Vast failure. Surely
we shd. profit by that lesson. Confine civil work to things they
can profitably do.
A.J. That is my intention.
P.M. Even after 7 closed, we shall have 16 – as cpd. with pre-war.
A.J. No : I shall reduce further at 2nd. stage.
P.T. P. tax on pots has bn. halved recently.
M. T.U. pressure will be awkward.
I.M. Might help Swynmerton and Scotland if Wigan and Poole were
announced now. Looks more like a plan.
A.J. On 2nd. round I might want to include some which wd. close as early as
Wigan and Poole.
Memo. approved – subject to announcing all seven.
6. Aircraft Industry.
A.J. Research undertaken for mil. reasons has bn. of gt. civil value. And
mil. interest in this is decreasing. Is the State to continue this
research, tho’ mil. need is less? Yes. i) industry has grown up on
it. ii) industry has to face f. competn. which has this help iii)
highly progressive industry wh. is of value to others.
Amount of genl. research = £70-80 M. Will drop. But want cost
transferred to civil votes.
149
M. Wd. have thght industry shd. join with State in research. This wd. have
effect incidentally of forcing larger units.
H.W. Corpn. orders. For next 8/10 yrs. they are committed. If industry were
not given continuing help on r. and d., they wd. collapse.
E.g. H. Page lamina flow. But they can get no civil orders. Can we
lose lamina flow altogether? Other examples : vertical take-off.,
supersonic flight.
A.J. Case for associatg. industry with r. and d. Also for charging it more for
specific service of State establishmts.
D.E. World demand for civil aircraft to ’65 : will be £2.100 M for new
aircraft and £700 M for spares. This offers big opportunities, in
place of mil. orders and Br. Corpn. orders. It thus becomes export
industry. Prestige of aircraft exports is v. high. Skilled labour
costs = large element in cost ; and we shd therefore be in good
posn. to compete with U.S., so long as r.and d. is done. We must
take care over subsidising r. and d. because free trade area rules.
Industry is short of working capital. Also concerned at credit for
overseas sales. U.S. can give 5 yrs. credit. Future looks like
leasing aircraft to operators.
Immense ques involved : need much more study esp. on finance.
If firms collapse, we may lose skilled men to overseas.
G.W. Transport Command can’t help. Britannia’s already ordered will last
us into ’70’s. A small need for short-range aircraft (vice
Hastings) but it won’t help this.
D.S. Need for re-organisation of industry into smaller no. of units is now
much more urgent. Wd. improve quality of research teams.
P.T. Re-organisation essential. What is needed precisely requires much
more thought. Amount of investment available is limited. No
agreement yet on real export potential. Study shd. now be
organised urgently – at a high level.
A.J. I agree.
P.M. Thought enquiry must follow on completion of “2nd. round” Doubt if
Cab. cd. decide to-day even the ques of principle.
i) yes : but how.
ii) Br. Corpns. and Transport Command can’t produce big
enough order.
iii) State help for r. and d. But how much?
iv) Is this a huge developing industry, world-wide.
Therefore urgent, diff. – market as well as methods : State/private :
Wd. like to discuss with Ministers concerned how best to get this
enquiry made.

* Ch/Exchqur. with Ministers concerned to make proposals.
