C.C. 60(57). 1st August, 1957.

1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.
R.A.B. Business for week after recess.
Cttee. on Privileges has reached agreement : no report before the
autumn.
2. Port Said Operation.
P.M. Propose that Genl. K.’s despatch shd. be published. Wd. be mistake to
w’hold it. Will scrutinise text, and show final draft to A.E.
Publish in recess. As early as possible in August. Agreed.
3. Cyprus.
S.Ll. Have assured F.D. that conference is genuine attempt. He will back it
with T. and G. But he doesn’t want to have U.S. observer – tho’ will
have expert in Ldn. at the time. This is best we can get from U.S.
Propose therefore to go ahead with T. and G. Govts.
[Exit S.Ll.
4. Industrial Disputes : Economic Cost.
I.M. a) Can’t keep too many balls in air at once. Lesson of last rlway dispute
– cd. have stood out on engineering but not that and others too.
b) Claims over next period will be staggered.
Main risk now is claims for 40 hr. week. If they were co-ordinated
into a single threat, we shd. have to meet it.
c) Can you isolate strike? Cousins’ policy is to spread it. Tried it over
Covent Gdn.
Mght be isolated rlway strike : we shd. have due notice of it.
* {We mght. have further study of detailed means by wh. emergency
{organisation wd. meet it : viz., rlway strike.
d) Wd. be dangerous to build up in Party a feeling tht. we are looking
for opportunity for a show-down. Don’t believe we cd. fight out
a strike in rlways and coal to a point at which men wd. give in.
Public opinion wdn’t tolerate it nowadays.
Prefer to aim at period of stability. Rely on new Council. Continue to
urge restraint.
R.A.B. Agree that Party are on dangerous line.
Emergency Organn. is as ready as it can be made.
Wd. like to be clear on legal point in para. 22.
Emergency Cttee. under me can’t consider or mitigate economic
effects.
Note the danger from the v. sensitive points e.g. drivers of oil
178
* tankers. Suggest Emergency Cttee. shd. make further plans on
that.
Agree tht. it wd. be diff. to face out a strike : but if Cousins made the
challenge we shd. have to meet it.
M. Agree with I.M.’s approach.
Doubt if these strikes wd. occur in isolation. Coal strike unlikely
unless w’spread dissatisfn. in T.U. movement : and in that event it
wd. spread.
Vulnerability by reason of power stations.
Not sure about para. 15 : confidence wd. turn on judgmt. wtr men wd.
win.
* Further study – likely trend of a future dispute. Where will challenge
come from.
H.W. If we allow feeling in Party to grow, it won’t help. We can’t take on
T.U. movement as a whole. Better to try to divide it.
* Favour earlier distn. of coal stocks.
None of 3 Rlway Unions have passed resoln. in favour of wage claim.
B.T.C. are inclined to try to avoid annual row over wages, but to
persuade Unions to spread it out. Shd. wish to encourage that. In
due course he will ask wtr Govt. will back him in standing pat on
an arbitn. award.
D.S. Wd. like to stand firm on an occasion when public opinion is behind us.
Best case is on an arbitration award.
Wd. like further thought given to a new Labour Relations Act – much
of it is quite out of date. Shd. embody a duty on T.U.’s to go to
arbitration.
D.E. If M/L. is right that we cdn't win, we must prevent war from starting.
To do that, we must arouse a sound public opinion. We shd. use
for this militant element in Party. Can we develop the deterrent
element in p. opinion. E.g. strikes affect consumers i.e. women :
cd. that fact be exploited. Danger of allowg. present feeling in
Party to grow.
Hail. Hankering for a show-down is dangerous. S.B.’s virtue.
Can’t really win a strike : creates such bitterness as to do more harm
than good.
i) Must, however, condemn violence and mobilise opinion v. it.
ii) Assert tht. country is governed by Parlt. not T.U.’s.
iii) Must guard v. paralysing blows e.g. power stations.
But in general shd. play this slowly and calm down our hot-heads.
In last resort a strike must be defeated by public opinion, not by Govt.
Ch.H. Much larger body of opinion regrets failure of Govt. to give clear lead
on inflation – or wage demands. Debate last week was good
because P.T. indicated tht. it mght be right to reject one. But how
do Govt. take such a line in dispute betwn. employers and men.
179
There is speculation on this. Can we clear up the doubt. What is
Govt. policy? Diagnosis has succeeded : we ought now to
indicate cure. What advice are Govt. going to give to parties?
I.M. That wd. be interference with collective bargaining wh. wd. lead to
“wages policy”.
P.T. Deep feeling among Tories (country) – anger and frustration. We are
getting it understood tht. higher wages mean higher prices. We
might do more e.g. with women.
But busmen have had 11/= and farm-workers now have 9/=.
Do arbitration tribunals really regard needs of national economy.
* Cd. we study alteration in methods of arbitration?
Only 2 alternative lines to follow – a) bargain of some kind with T.U.’s
offering capital gains tax or profits limitation (neither of which is
economically sound). b) cut off supply of money – involvg.
direct control over bank advances and 10-15% cut in public
expenditure.
Can’t recommend either of these courses. Prefer, pro. tem., to phase
back investment, to hold public expenditure at existg levels, and
to be ready at some stage to say “no” to a wage demand.
Hail. x/ Provn. in arbitration for national case to be presented by counsel.
I.M. Council is designed for that. Counsel wd. make it appear as a rule that
Govt. are siding with employers.
P.T. I still think x/ wd. be worth study.
Hail. Presentn. cd. be balanced.
H.A. Food supply in a strike – wd. be O.K. so long as oil is available.
On more genl. ques : more thght needed on strategy and tactics.
Solution lies in developmt. of public opinion. I wd. deplore a
clash : ut cdn’t rule it out if public opinion supported it.
Party feeling on T.U.’s. i) Privileged posn. is out of date ii) anger at
intimidation.
P. opinion favours principle of arbitn. We shd. study means of makg. it
more effective.
Tactics : in short term we may have to take a more positive line in reln.
to wage claims in nationalised industries.
Credit restn. Wrong to go on asking banks to act v. commercial
interest. May be better to have some direct control over banks.
Increasg. doubt wtr we can continue to reconcile full emplt., price
stability and free negotiation of wages. We may be driven to
somethg. like a wages policy.
In history it will look odd that Tory Party shd. have done nothg on this
sector in 9 years of office.
H. i) Arbitration : improvemt. shd. be studied.
180
ii) Coal stocks: v. vulnerable : cd. we not improve them : using
argument that Suez showed our vulnerability over stocks of coal
and oil.
D.S. Favour some legn. H.A.’s points. We shd. be ready to act on those
lines if opportunity offered.
J.M. Strength of feeling re Govt. inaction. Growing realisation that wage
increases are main cause of inflation. Need for “wages policy”
tho’ I don’t know what that means.
K. Remember that Tory Party must m’tain some popular appeal. T. U.
members and families are about 17 m. out of electorate of 28 m.
We, as a national party, must appeal to that section. That rules
out any ques of limiting “privileges” of T.U.’s.
Compensation of higher wages is more intelligent electorate.
Parties long in office tend to favour their extremists. Take care.
Arbitration : shortage of good men. Rely therefore on single Council.
H.B. N’less Govt. must m’tain order and check violence during strikes.
This is a duty of Govt. We must show tht. we can discharge it.
Party is concerned about wage increases in natd. indies. : it assumes tht.
Govt. do settle these claims.
P.M. (i) On narrower field, we see what further studies shd. be made [in
particular power stations, oil tanker drivers, stocks of coal and
oil.] We shd. safeguard vital points.
(ii) On broader ques, we are trying to reconcile irreconcilables with free
wage negotiation and also fixed exchange rate. There is no fuse
to blow. If it weren’t for st. area we cd. provide the fuse of a
floating rate. We must therefore consider all possible remedies.
First, help P.T. to hold public expenditure : it is because so much
money is pushed into the economy tht. the higher wages can be
paid.
Arbitration : circulate the old factual memo. by M/Labour.
Situation has changed since collective bargaining was evolved in 19th
century. Now the interests of both sides of industry is to exploit
consumers. Struggle is likely to be on ques wtr award of arbitn. is
to be implemented : support for employers will be in standing
firm on an award and not going beyond it.
Develop p. opinion on connn. between wages and prices.
Some of the ques shd. be brght to an issue – e.g. control of banking
system. [Exit E.H. Enter O.G.
5. Aircraft Industry.
P.T. Reported views of E.P.C. Private and unpublished investigation.
Agreed.
181
6. Nuclear Power. I.B.R.D. Loan.
P.T. Seek authy. to discuss possibility with Mr. Black when in W’ton in
September.
M. No diffce. betwn. borrowg. as a Govt. and borrowg. thro’ a natd. industry.
Strong objn. esp. if done in Wall St.
D.E. See the objns. But somethg. different about nuclear power. On other
hand U.S. may well exploit us in some way.
I.M. This is our special thing in wh. we take pride. That will be damaged if
we do it on U.S. money.
P.M. But it wd. be debenture, not equity. There wd. be no U.S. control.
M. Don’t trust U.S. not to take some advantage out of this – v. keen
competition internationally in nuclear developmt.
Hail. Prefer good money to bad publicity.
H.A. Favour P.T.’s plan – tho’ we shd. look at it again if it’s proposed to
come thro’ Wall Street.
Agreed : explore possibility but reserve final decision.
7. Cotton.
D.E. Peril point procedure wd. get us too far from present policy of making
b/p diffies. the only ground for protectn. New solution therefore
suggested – as in memo.
Sometime next autumn or winter there is bound to be recession in
Lancs.
A.L.B. This is least harmful way of doing somethg. It is not recommended
that we shd. do anything. If adopted and proved unsuccessful, we
shall be pressed to do somethg. which will be really harmful to
our Colonial interests and oversea trade.
Shdn’t be able to convince overseas territories tht. this is voluntary – if
we agree to police it even at request of H. Kong.
Can’t we leave H Kong out?
P.M. No chance of agreemt. with I. and P. if we leave out H. Kong.
O.G. Ultimately it threatens import quotas.
182
P.M. Don’t raise issue of imports from low-cost Commonw. producers. Try
this compromise line, to evade that issue.
A.L.B. If Cab. insist, I must be allowed to approach Govr. informally before
he receives instructions. I must warn him tht. this will spread to
other U.K. industries.
