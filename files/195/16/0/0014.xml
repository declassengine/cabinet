1. Sir Anthony Eden. [Enter O. Gore, E.H.

Message from Cabinet – sympathy.

P.T. Limit of £3,000.
H. Gift from Parliament – They have mace and Speakers’ Chair. Possibly
an inkpot. H/C. or Comm. Parly. Union.
Cttee. as above to consider both points.
4. Foreign Affairs.
4(a) Cyprus.
O.G. Aiming at composite resoln. in U.N. Shan’t press ours, if anodyne
altern. emerges.
P.M. May be unable to resist requests for enquiry into allegns. made by Gks.
O.G. Can’t carry our resoln. U.S. wd. abstain.
(b) Israel.
O.G. Dulles is not f’coming. Fears U.S. mght feel compelled to vote in
favour of sanctions resoln. if moved. But U.S opinion generally
would be v. hostile to such a move.
Canada have a v. good draft resoln. But U.S. showed it to Afro-Asians
who made a muck of it. Pearson may revive it in original form if
suitable opening occurs.
(c) Suez Canal.
L.P. Tel. 732 to F.O. fr ? W’ton or N.Yk.
56
P.M. Gt. advance to have got U.S. and others to put fwd. interim scheme,
providing for payment thro’ agent. Better posn. for us that this
offer shd. have bn. made. If turned down, we shan’t be alone.
L.P. Wdn’t wish this (designation of agent by Egypt) to be a precedent for
final settlement.
H.W. We shall have done v. well if we get this interim arrangement.
H. In presentn., put emphasis on agent not on E.’s choice of it.
O.G. Not yet finally approved by Dulles – tho’ a State Dpt. draft.
Likely that E. Govt. are going slow on clearance – as bargaining card
in Israel settlement.
P.M. We approach a period of v. hard decisions.
(f) Germany : Reduction of Br. Forces.
O.G. Germans are disturbed because diffy. of justifying to their Parlt. paymt.
of £50 M. costs. No more than we expected.
French are more diff. Threaten to oppose our plan in W.E.U. They
may not because own record.
P.M. Looks as tho’ we mayn’t get assent of W.E.U. on 1st. round. They may
assent at a 2nd. mtg. after NATO discussions. M’while we must
assume, for Estimates, that we shall do it.
5. Oil Supplies.
M. Supplies better, and consumption less, than we had assumed. But stocks
in jeopardy until Canal and pipe-lines are open.
Petrol. Consumptn. 64% of normal, but increasg. Stocks are high.
Will help us to end rationg. as soon as normal supplies can be
foreseen. i.e. arrivals matchg. consumption. Issue 90% : must be
large bank of coupons unused. Propose to legalise contd. use
[?all existing 3rd. month] coupons up to end/April. Want ‘bank’
used up before we raise value of coupon.
Fuel Oil. Improved. But demand is rising. Need to build stocks for
next winter. Propose to say present level will continue thro’
April.
Gas – diesel. Cuts can be reduced fr. 20% to 10% for industry and for
c.heatg. fr. 331/3% to 20% (?) from 1/4. Also abolish cut for ?
trawlers.
H.W. Will simplify my rationing system – as traders wd. wish.
Necessary also to free driving test insprs.
V. few bankruptcies, if any.
57
I.M. And almost no unemploymt.
D.E. Advance bookings by tourists: are below normal. Complaints.
Matched by excessive bookings of cars to Europe from U.K.
because of tourist petrol. Will mean loss of f. exchange, on
balance.
Wd. help if somethg. cd. be said soon about petrol for holidays in U.K.
in mid-summer.
M. Wd. favour early announcemt. re next issue of coupons. My draft is
helpful because optimistic in tone.
P.M. Fuel and Diesel. Relaxations now: on second. On first no gt. hardship.
And on coaches – will be increase.
Petrol. Diffy. that it’s widely known tht. stocks are high. And other
countries in Europe are not rationing. Cd. we say now tht., if
rationg. has to continue after Apl., it will be at least equal in
value to present. Then, if announcemt. of increased value of
coupon cd. be made later before end/Apl., wd. help to re-assure
people re holidays.
M. Ready to add this.
P.M. Add clear statement on facilities for foreign tourists – as a separate
statement. Soon. To Press, not in H/C.
{Statement in H/C. Wednesday – by Maudling.
{Text to be finally agreed betwn. M/T., M/P. and P.T.
M. Some expn. of gratitude to U.S.?
P.T. Turns on wtr Texas is f’coming.
M. Wd. like it said at some stage. Now or later.
P.T. * A cautious word of thanks, subject to Texas decn., in statemt. Wed.
6. Industrial Disputes.
I.M. Power Industries. Likely to be solved.
Briggs Bodies. Tangle because secret ballot in favour of strike, when
A.E.U. leaders don’t wish to.
Fear this strike may go fwd. If it’s made a matter of T.U. principle
they may seek to spread it beyond Briggs and Fords. No hope yet
of settlement.
Employers have some ground for standing firm.
