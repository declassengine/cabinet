C.C. 53 (57) 16th July, 1957

1. Post Office Charges. [Enter E.M., E.H.
P.M. a) First ques of principle : is it necessary to make so large a recovery in
18 mos. – turning loss of £6M into profit of £5M. Shd. we write
off the £6M and impose charges which will have us breaking
even?
b) Second ques : how the increases shd. be spread : post/telephone etc.,
Last increase in basic postal rate was 1940. Increase to 3d. and
redn. of weight to 1oz wd. yield £24 M. in full year.
H.A. Why not further increase in parcel charges?
P.M. Telephones : plan to reduce no. of exchanges so as to make larger areas
and increase area for local calls – from 90 sq. miles to 900. This
will be considerable concession.
Charge increases mght be deferred until Jan., when that new system
comes into operation. Prs. postal changes mght be brght in
before 1/10 to compensate for this.
R.A.B. Rural areas are v. badly off, for telephones.
P.T. But investment in telephones is heavier than in roads – and much of it in
rural areas.
PMG. £30 M. p.a. increase is minimum needed to cover costs. Better to raise
£42 M. now : for if we don’t we shall have to have another
increase in charges before Election.
R.A.B. Concerned at proposal to increase postal charges, wh. already pays its
way.
Telegrams are out of date medium.
P.M.G. £2½ M. on £58 M turnover (postal charges) is not a big profit.
P.M. And wd. be wiped out by increased costs?
PMG. Postmen’s wages £3.7.0 when 2½d. stamp introduced : now £9.9.0.
At 3d. postage wd. be cheaper than anywhere in Europe save Spain.
On b) prefer to take unpopularity now : also costs £1½ M. But I wd.
be ready to forecast the reform.
P.M. That wd. be worst of both worlds.
Ch.H. Tho’ unpopular, better to get it all over at once – w’out reference to
Jan. reforms. Profit on 2½d. stamp : if some services must be
losers, must make profit on others.
Unpopularity will be little more for £42 M. that it wd. be for £30.
160
R.A.B. Why not increase charges on services which are makg. little or no
profit.
P.M. Revert to a). Why do we have to cover as much?
I.M. Must do it all – but prefer to do it in stages. Do postal increases now
but defer telephones until Jan. when improved serviced come in.
M. Public are expecting it: we shall have to do it : I favour doing it now.
K. Real problem : is this an occasion for 2 bites or 1.? Cd. we present a
convincing case on 2 bite basis. No good announcg. 2nd.
instalment now.
H.B. If we soften blow now, we increase risk of having to do another round
of increased charges before Election.
E.H. To our advantage to do it all at once. But reduce diffies. in H/C. –
avoid legn.
(1) P.M. General views seems to be in favour of doing the whole
thing and all at once : taking effect on 1/10.
Detailed Changes. [Exit M.
P.M.G. To avoid legn: we shd. base £3/4m. on p.orders if we were unable to
increase poundage over 3d. I cd. get this money by increasg.
charges for private telephone lines.
Agreed : omit changes requiring legn.
Telephone rentals : why not put business lines at £14 [and private at
£11 so as to avoid jump of £9 to £12 for rural private.] Omit [].
16. Canadian Magazine Post.
A.L.B. Don’t w’draw this concession. Agreed.
Presentation.
PMG. and Ch. Hill to revise draft – for considn. by P.M., RAB. and
Ch. Whip.
P.M.G. Wd. it be wise to say at end: [increases due to wage increases
consequential on movements outside] : if reasonable stability in
wages no further increase in charges until spring of ’59.
P.T. Don’t believe it wd. impress H/C. Tho’ it wd. be useful to make point
at [] only.

2. Jute Industry.
J.M. Our deputn. went ill. They will claim in debate tht. earlier Govt.
statements implied continuing protection.
They also urge further repns. to Pakistan re their selling price. It might
be more effective now we are taking some action.
