C.C. 51 (57) 11th July, 1957

1. Duke of Windsor. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Publication of German documents – 29 July. Govt. statement : terms
read and some drafting suggestions made.
2. Egypt : British Evacuees.
P.M. Propose to announce terms of interim offer next week. Good chance
of getting individual assets de-sequestrated fairly soon.
This will meet personal hardship w’out weakening overmuch our posn.
in negotiating with E. Govt.
3. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
Mon. – Supply Day : Oppn. have asked for debate on Cyprus.
A.L.B. Awkward : can’t be sure we shall be in posn. to make statement before
recess: can’t therefore ask Opposn. to defer debate. But we may
find we shall have two, as result.
R.A.B. Cttee. of Privileges : deadlock: can’t hope to finish before autumn.
Result may mean legn. next session.
S.Ll. W. Paper on Disarmament – can be published in course of next week.
E.H. Arundel Bill : which Minister shd. speak?
R.A.B. Prs. none : Simon (H.O.) cd. watch the position and spk. if necessary.
4. Administrative Tribunals.
K. Rpt. will be presented 16/7. Copies will go to Press on 17/7: Franks
will see them. Presentation on 18/7.
Brief summary of recommendns.
Reasonable and likely to be popular with Party.
5. Disarmament : Nuclear Tests.
S.Ll. Period of suspension. We haven’t indicated our view. Propose now to
say we accept 10 months.
[Enter A.J., G.W.
152
6. Defence Programmes: Effects on Industry.
A.J. Resources released from r. and d. can’t necessarily be absorbed
elsewhere. Risk that some might emigrate.
Partly because they won’t want to change direction of their work.
Partly because we can’t be sure there will be increase in civil
research.
Do we leave this to free play of forces? Or do we make conscious
effort to expand research effort on civil work.
G.W. Support. Don’t let disintegration set in.
A.J. Esp. those engaged in research on super-sonic flight.
D.E. Are these men so wedded to one particular line of research. What of
shortages of scientists in atomic work.
x| One of the problems wh. shd. be considered by Cttee. of Ministers.
Agreed : as at x/.
H. May have some effect on estimate of requiremts of technologists – for
educational p’mmes.
A.J. Another example developmt. contracts – not in fact extended to civil
field.
[Exit A.J., G.W.
7. Cyprus.
P.M. Memo. results fr. discns with Govr. and represents attempt at new
approach.
Alternatives – i) Carry on as now. Mil. success with terrorism.
Pol. success in leaving Makarios to embarrass
Gks. rather than us.
ii) Partition. Wd. mark our failure. Risk of conflict
in island wh. mght even spread to war betwn. T. and
Greece. If it had not bn. for T., we cd. have
sought settlement with G.
iii) New Plan. Militarily, C.O.S. wd. prefer Br.
control over whole island if contented. But if
large forces continuingly needed to keep order,
strategic needs wd. not be met. Therefore, subject
to considn. of details, C.O.S. wd. at least prefer
new plan to (ii) and wd. regard it as tolerable.
Invite discussion of merits and dangers of the plan – also procedure and
timing.
A.L.B. Was tempted to wait – for Cypriots to come round to Radcliffe regime.
But no sign we can break deadlock that way.
153
S.Ll. Doubt if new plan will be accepted. Fear T. wd. look at it only if they
knew tht., if G. turned it down, we wd. go to Partition.
Lawyers etc., have now examined plan and think it viable.
A.L.B. We cdn’t do Partition before next Election. That wd. be a strong
argument with Turks.
H. We cdn’t afford to leave partition to G. and T.
Alternatives : stay as we are or propose this plan?
If we can’t break deadlock, can we afford troops to hold place down.
This plan cd. appear imaginative effort to solve intractable problem.
Best chance of extricatg. ourselves with credit.
Hail. Believe con-dominium is only clue to solution. Diff. to see how we
can sell it. But no better alternative.
P.T. All earlier schemes have failed because G and T. intransigence. Our
best chance is get firm united front with U.S. and Spaak before we
launch it – risking the leak danger.
M. We shd. be no worse off if we failed to sell it.
P.M. Points on the plan. i) Inherent in plan tht. we hand over our
sovereignty. If disorder followed, we cdn’t recover control.
Suppose Govr. can’t keep order? May ask us for more troops. ii) What
is posn. of Govr? Shd. we say he shd. not be Br. subject.
R.A.B. Who has the power to suspend constitn.? And wd. troops from our
enclaves be available to Govr. in that event?
x| If this proposal fails, I wd. concentrate on our resuming power. I wd.
not envisage partition by U.N. (para. 3).
What of the mandatory concept? Not necessarily under U.N. Wd.
prefer Br. mandate under N.A.T.O. – with G. and T. associated in
administration. From angle of adminn., joint sovereignty hardly
works.
A.L.B. That wd. involve surrender of all sovereignty : wdn’t appeal to Party.
D.S. Wd. be v. much like Radcliffe, which Cypriots won’t have.
Hail. Gks. wdn’t look at mandate basis.
R.A.B. My reasons : i) Nicosia airfield is needed for Br. use. ii) approaches to
enclaves : we really need Famugusta harbour. Don’t believe our
real mil. needs can be met adequately by enclaves w’out control
outside them.
D.S. If we are doubtful about G. acceptg. plan as now, it’s certain they wd.
reject mandate conception.
154
If the plan is rejected, I wd. make U.N. say what they think shd. be
done.
H.W. Don’t believe we can afford to carry this commitment indefinitely. I
don’t therefore like x/.
Must have supply-lines. Famugusta and Nicosia airfield.
H.A. No future in Micawberism. Encouraging to see a new approach. Once
this plan was started, we cd. not resume Br. control. But even so
a better plan than partition.
J.M. Condominium. Diff. to run. Sudan worked only when there was a
dominant partner. Can you link it more closely to N.A.T.O.
P.M. Provide tht. Govr. shd. have right to report to N.A.T.O. in emergency
and lay problem before them.
Hail. Don’t threaten partition because we never cd. do it.
I.M. No soln. unless disorder ceases. Triple sovereignty wdn’t work if
z| serious disorder : but then wdn’t be serious disorder if neither G. nor T.
encouraged it.
y./ External relns. : wd. need to be regulated by N.A.T.O.
Subject to y/ I favour this plan.
H.B. Not so sure about z/ esp. if G. comes in unwillingly. This regime cdn’t
cope with a resurgence of Gk. Cypriot terrorism. We shd. have a
fall-back posn. for that situation – and one which Gks. wd. like
even less.
P.M. Terrorism cd. then take form only of G. knifing T. and vice versa. Wd.
they want, or dare, to do that? With risk of repercussions e.g. in
Thrace and Istanboul.
P.M. Timing. i) Use months until Sept. by holding 3 Power Mtg or inviting
comment on Radcliffe – p’poning prodn. of this plan at or after U.N.
ii) Produce it or take soundings on it before U.N.
S.Ll. If terrorism is resumed, we shall be in worse posn.
If we want another chance of 3 Power Mtg, hold this back.
Doubt if we shall get U.S. support. Disagree with my advisers on
means of approach to U.S. T. is our firmest friend.
A.L.B. U.S. have come out in favour of independence, but w’out Enosis.
S.Ll. But will they stick to that when Election begins.
E.H. Party, now, wd. favour retention of whole Island under Br.
sovereignty. They will need a lot of convincing tht. resolution
won’t pull us thro’.
155
They will think def. policy was designed to enable us to defend such a
Br. interest as this.
Time needed to bring them round to this plan. No time for that in July.
V. narrow margin on divisions – as evidenced in Suez debate. Many
regard this as separate issue on wh. they cd. take a stand.
8. Commonwealth Economic Development.
H. E.P.C. has considered : wants memo. re-written and re-submitted to Cab.
next week.
Meanwhile in H/L. debates I shd. like to f’cast early publn.
P.T. No objn. to that.
9. Malaya.
H. As in memo. Together with a Speakers Chair from Parliament.
Approved.
