C.C. 79(57). 12th November,1957.

Egypt.
P.M. Negotiations in Rome. Neither delegation is plenipotentiary.
Agreement are ad referendum to both Govts.
Position reached – set out in C. 267. Explained as in memo.
Para. 5. Unlikely to get this w’out limit : for wd. give them advantage
as cpd. with situation pre-Suez.
What we face is this – i) Is it worth while to have any agreement? If
so, trade will re-commence and some relns. will be resumed. Is that
to our interest? Or is it better to m’tain economic freeze?
ii) If so, is this a good bargain?
A.L.B. Are French doing anything comparable?
S.Ll. They have no E. money, as basis for a bargain.
Hail. Agreemt. seems to contemplate our use of the £30 M. only for (b) viz.,
sequestrated properties – not for the nationalised.
P.T. It is deliberately vague : gives us open option.
Hail. But it lays no oblign. on E. Govt. in respect of 2(a) of C. 267.
P.T. Yes : para 2 applies to all Br. property.
Hail. Disputed this.
P.M. The claim in respect of nationalised property must be kept alive.
S.Ll. Yes : payment on a/c : we cdn’t accept this in full satisfaction.
D.S. Arbitn. shd. cover 3(a) as well as (b) and (c).
S.Ll. Look at policy first. Qua domestic policy, we shall have gt. trouble
with claimants if we don’t settle. Qua f. policy : by dragging on
we shan’t bring N. down – he can hang on despite economic
pressure. Have asked our Allies : they all favour a settlement
provided it doesn’t appear to be a surrender. It is in our interest
to resume relns. with E. and exercise influence there. I conclude
therefore in favour of a settlement.
War damage, and our claims re Base, are excluded. This, on whole, is to
our advantage.
P.M. Domestic : we shall have to get somethg. out of E. or pay claims
ourselves – to B. subjects who have suffered by reason of our act
of policy. We cd., in need, do that. Ques therefore turns on f.
policy considns. Is it better to await favourable turn of events.
224
If we make an agreemt., it must include some provision for
nationalised as well as sequestrated property.
H. Do we lose by delay? E. blitz on Jordan. Compenn. to Suez Canal Co.
is uncertain. Better to delay for month or so?
R.A.B. When shd. we get a better offer from E? This is surprisingly good. No
internatl. effect so long as we make it clear it doesn’t cover all
nationalised property.
P.M. Do we try to settle on basis of £30 M. – if agreemt. covers nationalised
property and provides adequately for arbitration on balance.
RAB. N. is evidently in a weak position : v. unlikely to get better offer later.
Hail. Pol. arguments are all in favour of settlement. But this cdn’t be
represented as a good business deal, except on basis tht. E. is
bankrupt. Leavg. aside individual claims, N. gets £100 M. assets
in return for £53 M. at most.
P.M. We cd. not, as bankers, pinch whole of E.’s sterling balances. Effect
on Kuwait, Malaya etc., wd. be v. serious.
First ques : do we accept an agreement on reasonable terms?
S.Ll. This bargain, if we can get it, benefits us more than him.
D.E. Take it : for he is so desperate tht. otherwise he may take somethg.
from R. which wd. be v. damaging to us.
M. Conclude – so long as it is made clear that is on a/c.
H. Still doubt if it’s wise – qua effects in M/E. What wd. T. and Jordan say?
S.Ll. T. wd. take it if it appeared a good bargain for us.
H. But what of effect on J.?
I.M. N.’s designs on J. mght be enhanced by a failure to get his £18 M? If
he got it, tension mght lessen.
H. Consult first with A. and N.Z. and also prs. with T. and J.
Hail. Certain crisis if we broke off negotns.
S.Ll. Also crisis here if this broke off and Canal clearance ques went bad on
us. But, if you play it too long, you may drive N. into R. arms as
we did over arms.
225
R.A.B. Pol. importance is being exaggerated. Make it plain No. 1 A/c. is
being put back as was – open. Also that £30 M. is on a/c. Then
it will be regarded as ordinary commercial matter.
P.M. | Say on figures : not less than £30 M. Then other points – return all
| sequestrated : £30 M. is on a/c of nationalised – tho’ we shall be
x| free to use if for either, as we like. Get it to point that, if there
| is to be agreemt., this will be it.
Agreed : as at x/.
U.S. to be kept informed,
also C., A. and N.Z. in confidence.
