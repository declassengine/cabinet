C.C. 75 (57) 22nd October, 1957

1. Parliament. [Enter E.H., O.G.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
Spokesmen in Econ. Debate. On Govt. motion. P.T. only on 1st. day :
I.M. and P.T. (or Birch) on 2nd. day. P.M. to intervene on 1st. day
if Oppn. make much ado over the “leakage”.
[Enter Perth
2. Queen’s Speech : Prorogation.
Approved subject to minor amendments. [Enter A.G., B.C.
3. Legislative Programme.
a) Agricultural Policy.
K. Two new factors i) Franks on agric. tribunals – wd. require legn. and
this wd. direct attention to disciplinary powers and wd. call for
statement of Govt. policy. ii) Unexpected degree of agreement
betwn. parties on security of tenure.
In view of these Sub-Cttee. have reached agreemt. on a plan for dealing
with disciplinary powers and security of tenure and also submit
proposals on rent. Fourth and last point = Scottish law on
bequeathing property.
L.P.’s test : popular with our Party tho’ not w’out controversy.
necessary because under discussion for 3 years : bring
Agric. Acts up to date after 10 years : necessary for
efficiency of agric.
H.A. Shall be in serious trouble if we miss this chance – for
i) Franks report shows how vulnerable our posn. is. That
requires amendmt. anyway of Part II of Act.
ii) For first time we have measure of agreemt. betwn. farmers
and l’lords on security of tenure. It may evaporate if we
don’t legislate.
iii) We have now given long-term assurances : Part I now
stands alone and penal provns. no longer justified.
Oppn. will resist any amendmt of 1947 – but prob. not with heat.
Some controversy inevitable over rents – tho’ not much fr. farmers.
Controversy won’t therefore be at all unmanageable.
If we don’t proceed, it will be seen to be due to timidity.
J.M. Endorse H.A.’s arguments.
Must admit, however, tht. Scottish point (tho’ right) will be
controversial.
211
P.M. Must we come to urgent concln. on this merely because of Q. Speech?
V. little time for Cab. to consider. Cd. we not find a phrase which
would enable us to do some of these things.
R.A.B. We can leave out slaughterhouses Bill anyway.
Hail. Agric. reform wd. be popular : especially on disciplinary powers.
R.A.B. Insert refce. to agric. in para. 24. Put 18 in general terms. Omit
reference to slaughterhouses.
Agreed : A general reference to this only in the Speech.
Consider before Debate on Address content of the
legn.
(b) Penal Reform.
R.A.B. No need to mention the minor proposals for legn in the Speech. Only
ques is wtr we refer in Speech to appointment of R. Commn. A
big task. Will take several years. L.C.J. agrees. T. of r. shd. be
examined again, and submitted to P.M.
A.G. Uneasy about this. Sentence shd. follow quickly on conviction. Wd.
prefer that enquiries shd. be completed before conviction.
Changes in Assize and circuit system wd. hardly be justified on
this a/c. What are the changing conditns. for dealing with
offenders? No reference here to civil work. Deprecate implacn.
tht. higher cts. pass sentence w’out adequate informn.
Hail. No case has bn. made out for R. Commn. Blow to tradition.
P.M. R.A.B. to discuss this proposal with lawyers in Cab. and reserve
decision wtr last sentence of para 27. shd. be included in the
Speech.
Possibly thro’ H.A. Cttee.
R.A.B. also to consider wtr a reference shd. also be made to intention
to deal with Wolfenden recommns. on prostitution.
(c) Pensions.
P.M. * Separate Cab. on the ques of substance. For that question only. *
For Queen’s Speech only ques is wtr we add some reference to our
x| continuing study of wider problems of provision for old age.
At the further mtg we can at least decide on nature of the further study
to be made. The August plan needs little further work if we
wanted to do it. On Sept. plan, there is not enough informn. to
warrant decn. in its favour. We ought to have further study of
practical and adminve. problems which it wd. involve.
But in any event we are not in posn. now to foreshadow legn. next
Session on “part 2”.
212
Agreed : add to Speech words to effect of x/.
(d) Tariff Policy.
D.E. As in memo.
H. x/ Views of Doms : they don’t dissent – not “agree”.
P.T. Support.
P. Plea for retention of the bar qua Colonies.
P.M. This is single item in v. large codifying Bill. In debate x/ will cover us
qua Doms. For colonies we shd. be in greater diffies. Distinction
betwn. Col. and Doms. wd. hardly work in practice – cf. posn. of
emergent countries. Believe we cd. rely on practice and policy
w’out putting it into new Act as statutory requirement. I wd.
prefer therefore to start Bill w’out a bar : but we mght have to
amend Bill under pressure. And if so we ought prs. to warn
Doms. [and Colonies] that we may be forced into concession on
this point.
D.E. Duty-free entry for Colonies is already secured by trade agreements.
P.M. Reality is quotas, not tariffs. Bill deals only with latter.
P. If it doesn’t matter, why not keep bar?
D.E. Because it is gt. handicap to us in reln. to Doms.
P.T. Yes : we often have to pay v. dearly for this unreality in trade
agreements with other (foreign) countries.
E.H. No diffy. with Party if A.L.B. will tell them there is no risk.
P. Fear he may be unwilling to do so.
Agreed : Frame Bill on basis that bar is not retained.
(e) Other Legislation.
P.T. Public Works Loans and Trustee Savings Banks – both are essential by
definite dates. Shd. be added to List B. Agreed.
E.H. Time-table. L. Govt. Bill : may get 2nd. Rdg. before Xmas. Pensions
is ready. So is H/Lds Bill, but that was to be started in H/L. We
are short of major legn., and may be forced to start with minor
measures.
213
Agric. Bill not ready. But Slaughter-houses is ready. We may have to
use it.
D.E. Tariffs Bill cd. be brought forward.
4. Queen’s Speech. Opening of Parliament.
P.M. Cttee. to revise in light of to-day’s discussion.
R.A.B. Wd. be wise to try, with K., to re-cast – in light of Canadian speech.
We cd. omit 8.”
P. and H. On no!
P.M. We aren’t going to do what critics want.
Also 14.
J.M. This was mine – for Scotland : it wd. help me.
P.M. Opening paras. Add reference to Queen’s visit to U.S./Canada and prs.
to my own.
Omit references to E. property (para. 4).
D.S. Para 6. drop contrast betwn. rights and interests.
Para. 9. Reference to conditions of service. Has bn. made already.
P.T. Damaging leak in Times. Better say nothing now.
P.M. Will also provoke enquiries about pay.
D.S. But remember state of recruiting.
P.M. You mght have the words of the White Paper. Agreed : omit para 9.
I.M. Para. 14. Omit – it will provoke pressure. fr. any area in wh. there is a
pocket of unemploymt.
P.M. Para. 16. Omit – too detailed.
Retain para. 20.
D.S. Para. 21. Delete “progressive”.
R.A.B. Omit para. 25.
Stet para 26.
Para 29 – add words referring to further study. And put it higher up.
