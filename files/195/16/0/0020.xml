C.C. 25(57). 28 March 1957

1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.
R.A.B. Mon : debate on B’muda. Spokesmen : P.M. and S.Ll.
Much will be said on nuclear tests.
Business for remainder of week.
2. Electricity Bill.
No note taken.
3. Cyprus.
P.M. Unwise to announce relaxns. of E.R. in same statement – would look
like a bargain. This wd. be more agreeable to Turks.
A.L.B. Content with this presentn. Govr. is willing to defer his relaxations
until after his return to Cyprus.
Amendments of drafting – suggested and approved.
S.Ll. On substance – what are next steps?
A.L.B. No profitable consultn. with Cypriots until NATO initiative has bn.
carried some way. Stress that, and say we can’t usefully go to
discussion of internal situation until we see what progress is
made on internatl. side of problem. But indicate that at the proper
time talks will be held, on internal aspects, with suitable repves. of
Gk. and Turkish Cypriots – and admit that Makarios is likely to be
one of former. Can say he will not be sole repve. of Cyprus. Also
that he can’t be allowed to return to Cyprus.
L.P. This confirms my view that it is mistake to release Makarios now. His
condn. is tht. we call off the emergency. Tho’ we deny that we
accept this condition, if we release him we imply acceptance. We
therefore hand him the initiative : viz., enable him to use threat of
reviving terrorism as means of extorting concessions in discussions
when they start. “Post-fabricated” argument in para. 5.
I couldn’t be a party to this decision.
P.M. On form of statement – I see objn. to first part of para. 5. Mght be
better to say : “Nevertheless they see no advantage in continuing
his detention.”
That is the real question. Is there any advantage in keeping him any
longer?
Wd. there by any gain for us in re-conquering Cyprus? We haven’t
really decided what is our ultimate purpose over C. If we want
82
to create an impasse, we mght wish to have talks on R. Rpt – to
reach impasse over s.d. wh. can’t be condition unless other
Govts. agree.
They might waive that condition, if we brght them up against Partition.
Gks. dislike that – possibly so much tht. they wd. accept R.
constitution. This is different fr. Ireland – because it may be our
purpose to get out.
L.P. We mustn’t give impression of being pushed around – will react on our
posn. in other parts of world.
Wd. sooner say now we favour partition.
H. His release now will make it more diff. for us to play the hand as we
wish. Pressure for his return to C. will grow. And if we have to
yield on that we shall be in v. weak posn.
Hail. In long run will see tht. C. is more liability than asset, militarily. Only
mil. po …………
P.M. Cab. is divided. Arguments are nicely balanced. This is bound to be
so on many of the issues we now have to face. Don’t like this.
But believe tht., when A’bishop’s statement is publd., people will
think he has come some way. He will be careful about re-starting
terrorism. Not satisfied that, w’out a pol. move, Govr. wd. be
able to eradicate it wholly – v. hard in mountainous countries.
Best we can hope is tht. it can be brght under control for long
enough to enable us to make a move twds pol. solution.
Hope Cab. will endorse release as the better of 2 v. diff. courses.
Presentn. now proposed will be more correct : more agreeable to
Turks and to Tory Party.
H. Not, for me, a ques of principle. Tho’ I fear it is a mistake.
L.P. V. difficult for me. No use remaining in a Cab. if one frequently
accepts decns. v. own judgment. Undermines confidence in one’s
judgment. Must therefore ask to be allowed to consider my
position.
4. Industrial Disputes.
I.M. Engineering. Cts. of Enquiry (2) may take 3 or 4 wks. Can’t accept
continuance of strike for so long as this. Need therefore new
formula to end strike. Unions will call it off if there can be talks
with employers: then they will leave Ct. of Enquiry to decide.
But the employers are at present v. stubborn. Am seeing them
again.
