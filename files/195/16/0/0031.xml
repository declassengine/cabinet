C.C. 40 (57) 14th May, 1957

1. Foreign Affairs. [E.H.
a) Jordan : overflying rights.
2. Home Guard. [Enter J.H.
J.H. V. strong sentimental and political reasons for not disbanding. The
nucleus and the reserve are good chaps, who will be greatly upset.
My proposal is submitted solely on financial grounds. For the nos. are
running down and to stop that we shd. need to spend £100.000 this
year and £50.000 next. Also, reserves of rifles and uniforms cd. be
used for Army, at saving of £2 M.
Put them in cold store now. But legn. wd. be needed next year to
relieve us of our oblign. Amendg. legn. shd. include power to reactivate
in future emergency.
R.A.B. Better to disband, and face the legn. Can’t otherwise be sure of savings.
D.S. Can’t continue expenditure on this while refusing it for things which
are much more valuable militarily.
S.Ll. Dissent : will increase impression abroad tht. we are dismantling our
defences. Not worth risking that for small sums involved.
R.A.B. They are not of any reality locally – since we disbanded the adjutants.
P.M. Ask L.O.’s to advise wtr legn. is really necessary, if what we mean to
do is to allow it to wither away.
No announcement in Estimates debates.
D.S. Wd. wish J.H. to say in debate that Home Guard has no great role to
play.
J.H. Not in debate. Later, when I know more clearly what we going to do.
[Exit J.H.
[Enter B.C.
3. Old Age Pensions.
P.M. Oral statement on lines of my aide-memoire.
Can we to-day decide in principle that we shd. try to devise a
major measure of reform. Possibilities : we discard i) meanstested
pensions ii) exclusion of classes iii) simple increase of
retirement age under existg. scheme. Alternative possibilities for
further examination.
If Cab. agree in principle that we shd. aim at major scheme, we must
study possibilities rapidly – thro’ an extended Ministerial Cttee.
Action : i) directive to central office. on Labour plan.
119
ii) expanded Ministerial Cttee. under R.A.B.
iii) official Cttee. thereunder.
R.A.B. Support this recommn. Deficit : £420 M. in 70’s. We must make a
radical approach to this – to balance efforts on defence. If we are
to reduce load, we must relate contns. and benefits to earnings. We
must act in a way to support credit and economy.
This may not be attractive politically. Tho’ wd. be easier if flat-rate
cd. be held as a fall-back position. May need review of ques
what is old age, despite Election pledge.
Answer is Crossman – he hasn’t disclosed cost to contributor.
P.T. Many people will say tht. when we are fighting for our lives
economically it is no time to increase provn. for old age. But
demand for a new approach. And existg. scheme needs radical
change because unsound.
Immedte. problem – how deal with Crossman. Diff. to attack. At 1st.
sight v. attractive – immediate increase to £3. Will attract attentn. :
and we shall have advantage of seeing what comment it arouses.
Can’t outbid Labour. Stress cost to contributors. Point out tht. he
is raising contribution income to make a fund for take over type of
nationalisation.
D.E. B/T. responsible for insurance. The cos. see Crossman as blow to their
future. Are they going to be stimulated to attack it?
H.A. Pol. mistake to limit legn. to raising flat rates. Avoid competition.
Better to act before Election. Back-service concessions are what
undermines solvency of these schemes.
M. Industry under T.U. pressure to accept a national supplementary
scheme. They await a lead from Govt.
H.W. Weight of feeling that old people shd. have better life – incldg facilities
to do light work. Scope for further service shd. not be overlooked.
P.M.’s proposal – approved.
[Exit B.C.
4. Petrol Rationing.
M. Propose to announce termination to-morrow.
Second para. (keep ration books) now seems unnecessary. New books
will be ready in 6 weeks’ time. Even if Canal were closed again,
we cd. defer re-imposition of rationing for 10 weeks.
Approved.
120
5. Development Areas.
D.E. i) Is it right to de-schedule ii) which areas iii) when iv) disposal of
factories.
“Exceptional risk of unemployment” no longer applies to areas I have
in mind. De-scheduling will give more flexibility. The more the
areas, the less help can be given to each.
Now wish to add S. Lancs. to the list. Cdn’t. justify incln of Merseyside
if S. Lancs. were left out.
S. of S. Scotland is reluctant to de-schedule N. Ayrshire.
J.M. Doubts about pol. wisdom of doing this now. Will cause local
concern. But in N. Ayrshire there is exceptional risk of
unemploymt – also the overspill problem fr. Glasgow. 2.5%
unemplt. now : but likely to rise to 3.4% thro’ closure of a R.O.T.
Glasgow has 15 or 16,000 unemployed. Legn. is going thro’ on
overspill. N. Ayrshire will be vital area for this ; and facilities of
Dev. Area Act will be valuable in re-settling these people. Must
treat this part of Scotland as a single area.
D.E. In England overspill is handled by new towns w’out advantage of Dev.
Areas facilities. Embarrassing that this shd. be used in Scotland.
J.M. For pure overspill – yes. But Glasgow movement is within a dev. area.
P.T. Arguments for action –
i) These were scheduled when it was thought there wd. be
continuing unemplt. in areas of heavy industry. Is not so now.
ii) Estimates Cttee. rightly critical of continuing exp’re.
N. Ayrshire : better case cd. be made for many English areas.
P.M. No need for action. Schedulg. of areas gives permissive power, does
not compel it. Exp’re has already bn. run down to £5 M.
Consider Parly. and public controversy if we go ahead – v. diff.
legn. both on areas and on disposal of factories etc., Cdn’t you run
down exp’re still further e.g. to £3 M.
H.B. Diff. qua Wales. Strong case for scheduling N.W. Wales – esp. when
prosperous Wrexham is one. For Wales, this is moment to make
a change.
P.T. If you de-schedule, what do you do with factories? Quite a
complicated problem – not wholly solved.
R.A.B. Agree : no solution yet found ; and we can’t decide on de-schedulg.
until it is.
I.M. Pol. argument in favour – evidence of success.
I am closing 150 Exchanges – also controversial, but success.
121
P.M. Believe decision shd. turn on readiness of machinery for handling
consequential action, on factories etc., Wd. wish to see plan for
this before we go ahead.
D.E. Can’t make such a plan w’out consultns., which will leak. Wd. sooner
make some announcemt. first.
D.S. Cdn’t we relax pressures and preferences and see wtr areas can hold their
own.
D.E. Have done this and am satisfied that they can.
P.T. Agree that consequential problems are crucial. I favour studying them,
even acceptg. risk of leakage.
K. My instinct wd. be against action. Wd. shake confidence in dev. areas,
where people are at last beginning to forget the suffering of the
inter-war years.
H.B. Disagree – support I.M.
If announcemt. made now, no Parly. action wd. be needed before Dec.
J.M. K.’s comment applies especially to Scotland. Too early.
P.M. Let us have a more specific plan and time-table – incldg. problems of
disposal of commitments and other consequential action.
* Let 2 or 3 Ministers go into this.
6. Representation of Vatican in U.K. [Exit P.M.
S.Ll. As in memo. Time is not ripe for a change.
R.A.B. Internuncio wd. not attend ceremonial functions. The existg. repves.
declined invitations to Coronation.
P.T. Unwise to stir up feelings.
J.M. Certainly in Scotland.
Hail. Easier ways of pleasing R.C.’s – e.g. on Education Act.
