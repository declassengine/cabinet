C.C. 63(57). 27th August, 1957.

1. Welfare Orange Juice. [Enter V.M., Profumo.
P.M. Agreed that distribution to children from 2-5 shd. be discontinued, as
from 1st. November. Agreed.
What about reducing the subsidy also?
P.T. We cd. meet our commitment to W. Indies even if subsidy reduced.
H.A. We mght make it ½ price, as with other welfare foods.
V.M. Wd. not have support of Cohen Cttee.
Hail. Wd. confuse the clear clinical reason for w’drawing issue to 2-5
children.
P.M. Then let us reduce subsidy to ½ price level at about time of next
Budget. Reserve for final decision then. Agreed.
Prof. That wd. affect W. Indies and we shd. have consider that also.
[Exit V.M.
2. Sale of Arms : Cruiser for Turkey.
[Enter S.
P.M. F.O. favour : M/D. oppose.
H. We refused to give cruiser to Pakistan : they paid.
S. Even if they sold Goeben for scrap, they wd. have to fine £700.000 to
re-condition it. No strategic value. No advantage to us.
D.E. They are insolvent on commercial debts. This shdn’t take priority over
those obligations. Madness, commercially.
Hail. They have already had destroyers.
P.M. Because of Cyprus, F.O. don’t want to send reply less favourable than
in Feb. – when we said that if they get £300.000 for Goeben, and
£100.000 and find credit for refit, we wd. provide hull for
£300.000. They won’t find the credit.
P.T. We shd. then be asked to provide credit for refit. We shd. make it clear
we can’t do that.
Agreed : reply as proposed by F.O. [Exit S.

3. Cyprus.
P.M. No reply from Greece. U.S. forecast negative reply wh. will, however,
leave some doors open.
x/ Turks likely to seek p’ponement until after elections – 16/10.
S.Ll. and I agreed we must accept x/. Shd. therefore continue to press for
conference – thus keeping it alive.
General agreement.
Ques now : shd. we tell U.S. more of our plan? This needs thought.
Timing – prs. a little later. But straws are in wind and awkward
vis-à-vis U.S. if more came out.
P.T. But danger, from Party angle, of leakage from U.S.
D.E. Shd. have to tell U.S. before any debate in U.N.
P.M. S.Ll. shd. consider this on return – feel there may have to be some
communn. in 2nd. half of September.
[Exit Profumo.
4. Egypt : Sale of Viscounts.
P.M. Nature of payments into No. 1. Special Account. Egypt’s earnings
from these sources can be used for purchases in U.K. In fact they
have used v. little.
Ques : do we regard this purchase of Viscounts as an ordinary purchase
out of funds in No. 1. Special Account?
D.E. Let them go.
H.A. and H. Agree.
Hail. If it’s our policy to squeeze him (Nasser) why let him have these.
P.T. Nothing less effective than half-hearted trade embargo.
P.M. Explain it to U.S.
Agreed : 1. No interference with decision taken.
2. Explain posn. to U.S. Govt.
3. N.B. to ascertain first wtr there are unsatisfied
orders for Viscounts from Doms.
P’pone decision until 3. done.
Dropped. – [4. Get clearer picture of amount of trade with E.
[and wtr they have discharged any of old debt.
191
5. Sale of Arms. Jordan.
Hail. Why not do this, and face need to sell half a doz. to Israel. They will at
least help us v. Syria.
P.T. I wd. let this go, and reserve decn. on Israel.
P.M. It was originally 54 : but prs. we can tolerate supply of 15.
Agreed : Allow this supply to Jordan, recognising tht. we
may have diffy. in refusing supply to Israel for
Zionist feeling in H/C. is now running v. high.
6. India : Export Credit.
D.E. Adv. Council of E.C.G.D., whose advice we take on commercial
considns., have said tht. India is not credit-worthy beyond £25 M
p.a. for medium-term. Offers already out will total£34 M.
Evident tht. India, havg. failed to get large Governmental loan,
are trying to get it this way round piecemeal. Part 2 of Act
empowers us to give Govt. loans wh. are not commercially
justifiable under Part 1.
C.R.O. and Ty. agree with B/T. tht. we must accept advice given qua
Part 1. This will be blow to Indian credit, and will cause India to
draw down balances more rapidly.
Credit short-term will go on.
H. See no option but to accept this.
Agreed : subject to discussion P.T., M/State B/T., M.,
G. Laithw. on methods of informing Indian Govt.
etc.,
7. Syria.
P.M. Mysterious messages from Dulles : purport not wholly clear.
Diff. and dangerous situation. U.S. uncertain re action.
First message suggested 6th. Fleet : second stated Loy Henderson.
I replied – 3316 to W’ton.
I have also indicated tht. we wd. re-establish depl. relations with
Saudi’s w’out waiting for request from King Saud.
I have indicated, in reply to F.D.’s enquiry, our view on pipelines.
(Tel. 3336 to W’ton).
Don’t want ourselves or U.S. to take any action which wd. provoke S.
to cut our pipelines – unless it precipitates a lasting solution. If
U.S. were willing to do a Suez, we wd. support it. But don’t
want them merely to make faces at them.
192
M. Pipelines : 25 m tons p.a. from Iraq and 12 m (Aramco) fr. Saudi. Wd.
not cripple Europe. But would ruin Iraq.
P.M. Read provisional draft of message to F.D. What is advantage of
risking short-term economic injury, if we haven’t a plan for
securing a long-term solution.
Hail. If Syria has cause to cut pipe-lines, E. might well deny us the Canal.
D.E. If force is to be used, local (Iraq or Turkish) troops wd. have to do it.
For recent experience has shown that any white armed
intervention in M/E. will unite all Arabs in opposition.
P.M. I will consider, in light of discussion, terms of a personal message to
F.D.
