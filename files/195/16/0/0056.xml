C.C. 74 (57) 21st October, 1957

1. Bank Rate : Alleged Leakage. [Enter E.H.
P.M. K’s enquiry. Rpt. recd. Concln. – no grds. for further enquiry. I
propose as P.M. to take responsibility for this decision.
Alternatives i) to have formal enquiry : no case and unfair to L.Ch.
ii) publish report, which wd. show up flimsiness of
evidence.
But contrary to precedent : informn. was given in confidence : K.
didn’t warn witnesses of publn. and they hadn’t advantage of legal
repn. Moreover, they mght then demand a further enquiry.
Summarised nature of evidence.
Regard report as confidenl. between K. and P.M. Don’t propose to show
it to anyone. X/ No reflectn. on conduct of Ministers or anyone
else. Read proposed letter to Gaitskell.
Intend to m’tain this position in H/C – tho’ there may be a row.
K. Endorse x/.
I.M. Had hoped my Dpt. might have bn. cleared, by publn. of Rpt. But
accept your concln.
R.A.B. Publn. of matter exposing relns. betwn. Govt. and Central office wd. lead
to endless debate.
P.T. Agree we shd. expose too wide a flank.
Agreed.
[Enter O.G.
2. Washington Meeting.
P.M. Eis. suggd. mtg. Their mood is interesting. Ready for closer U.S./U.K.
co-operation as core of co-opn. by free world. “Too much of take
and leave it in U.S. attitude (F.D.)” and Eis. regretting that
combined C.O.S. had bn. disbanded after the war. Mood similar
to that when NATO was establd. Quote from P.M.’s earlier
message to E of 10/x.
Two practical points to gain i) repeal of Macmahon Act, and concept
of collective defence, effort of one complementg. that of another;
and ii) continuing Anglo-U.S. study of policy and plans – pol.,
econ. and military – and means of giving effect to it either thro’
internatl. organisations or otherwise. Informal and covert
arrangemts.
But ii) can’t be said publicly – wd. create jealousies elsewhere.
Don’t know how much further U.S. may want to go. Won’t commit
HMG to more. But R. is formidable enemy, in strong position
ruthlessly to exploit their power, and with strong propaganda
206
(progress) to sell – cf. Napoleon – the appeal to common people.
In long run we can’t withstand this w’out much greater cohesion
in free world. Joint interests, defence and f. policies of U.K./U.S.
are same : we shd. go twds. merger. If U.S. Govt. are in this
mood, I shd. wish to exploit it.
R.A.B. Short-term problem in M/E?
P.M. Danger is subversion, not military. A mil. alliance wdn’t meet it.
Syrians likely to pretend they are not satellite – Tito-ist line.
O.G. Limitrophe Arabs are beginning to take more realistic view.
P.M. We are forced back on containment plus.
H. Cd. we mobilise opinion for solution of Arab/Israel dispute? Timing
may not be right. Doms. wd. support such an initiative.
O.G. Wd. be diff. to settle it w’out R. – but fatal to bring them in.
H.W. R. offers to supply goods on terms we can’t match will increasingly be
difficult. Can’t overcome those diffies. * w’out U.S. aid.
P.M. R. don’t want settlement in M/E. Will be a struggle. Ques : how can
we turn condns. for it more to our advantage.
And Africa will be their next target. * and G. aid.
3. Wages. [Enter W.S., E.M.
P.T. Our example, with own employees, will have important effect on
others. Many serious people think we shd. say “no” all-round,
incldg. no arbitration. I.M. and I think this wd. go too far. We
propose instead tht. we shd. m’tain principle of fair comparison,
make lowest offer we can, accept arbitn. and recoup cost of any
awards to fullest extent practicable.
First case : this week. 4% increase for industrials. No option but to
give it : automatic procedure. But slackening of work in R.O.F.’s
will offset increased cost: elsewhere we must meet it by
retrenchment.
Limit offers to low (but not derisory) levels.
Natd. industries. Chairmen have bn. warned.
I.M. a) Signs that Union are not keen to have major clash on wages.
b) Are we sure this policy is practicable. Can we recoup cost of
wage increases. Natd. indies. Can see how it wd. work in rlwys.
by reduced staff or services. How does it work in coal?
P.T. Admit coal is difficult. Cd. not recoup directly.
207
H.W. Further thought needed, even on transport. Ldn. Buses : 2.000 undermanned.
On merits they have a good case : and on arbitn.
regardless of natl. interest they wd get 6%. Appln. of this policy
will not be easy.
Rlways. Wish to inform B.T.C. formally that Govt. are not prepd. to
advance more money than last year [for developmt]. This is a
preliminary to discussion on means of meeting any increase in
wages by retrenchment. Agreed : this shd. be despatched.
M. I have obtd. assurances that on wages and prices my Boards will make no
move w’out consulting me.
H.W. Think we shd. deny now th famous dictum “if nation willed the end it
must will the means”. Wd. like P.T. to say so in econ. debate.
P.M. Difficult policy. Can’t expect 100% success.
M/L. shd. press on with considn of permanent scheme of arbitn in place
of existg. D.R.
P.T. Gt. importance of Govt. action, especially now at outset.
N.H.S. Wage Increase.
P.T. This must be test of our sincerity. Minister can’t accept this. My
recommn. is tht. we shd. offer to go to arbitration. If award (£½ M)
is made, won’t be easy to cover it by retrenchmt.
Ch.H. No arbitn. available : proposal is to manufacture opportunity for it. Is
this a robust course? Awkward precedent.
P.M. x/ Better surely to defer for 6 months. Arbitrator is almost certain to
award an increase.
W.S. Cost of increased wages in remainder of financial year (£300,000) wd.
have to be found – or we wd. be in breach of faith.
Moreover retrenchment in N.H.S. wd. involve lowering standard of
service : and possibly resignation of members of Boards w’out
wh. we can’t run the Service.
P.M. Rather than x/, better perhaps to decline to apply award because of
national circs.
Later : tell them to bring it up again in 6 months w’out promising to
give effect to it then.
P.T. No undertakg. re retrospection. It cdn’t be made retrospective.
208
Agreed : In view of econ. situation can’t give effect to this
award at present time. Later, we may be ready to
consider it. If they ask for arbitn., bring it back to
Cabinet.
Form of words to be settled by Health Ministers in
conusltn with P.T.
New Towns.
H.B. Our Whitley machine, tho’ theoretically weak, always works.
They do consult us.
P.T. V.Well. But let us at least consider the machinery of these Whitley
Councils.
Post Office.
P.T. Points of disagreement. i) we can’t make offer on one grade, where
fact finding is not complete because we have just refused on that
ground a much bigger C.S. claim.
ii) actual offers.
E.M. This is last 20% of Priestley award. (consequential). And I have said
in H/C. tht. charges take a/c of awards expected.
Figures suggested by Ty. are quite inadequate.
Advantage of Ty. line (sole one) is tht. award will be made at arbitn.
But, will cost us more, will involve breach of faith, and will sour
relations with Union.
On new claims I am ready to follow P.T.’s policy.
P.M. Is it a blow to general policy to settle this by negotiation : given the
fact that it is an old claim.
A v. large sum. Will appear to be weakening of general policy. We
ought therefore to play for arbitn. We don’t want to settle this by
negotiation.
D.E. Strong point in E.M.’s favour is tht. we have covered the estimated
cost.
P.T. Even more may be given at arbitn. But I wd. prefer that.
R.A.B. x/ Make a non-derisory offer, but one wh. will get us to arbitn. x/ }
} (x)
P.T., I.M. and E.M. to decide what is x/ }
Agreed : as at (x)
209
4. Compulsory Acquisition of Land.
H.B. As in memo.
Approved: not this session.
5. Opening of Parliament: Television.
P.M. B.B.C.’s annual letter.
Decision of ’53. But since then Queen has done this once – in Canada
– incldg. reading of a Speech.
We can’t do it this year. But pos. we shd. re-examine it, before next
year.
