C.C. 43 (57) 29th May, 1957

1. The Queen : Flight in Comet of Transport Command. [Enter E.H., G.W.
P.M. Shd. Queen use Transport Command Comet for visit to Fighter
Command in Scotland? (Leuchars.)
G.W. Best-tested machine we have in R.A.F.
Agreed : no objection.
[Exit G.W.
2. Parliament.
E.H. Business for next week.
Whitsun Recess – until 25th. June.
3. E/West Trade.
S.Ll. Jan ’56 President showed sympathy. No result. At B’muda I handed
notice of intention to Dulles – differential shd. be abolished. In
last 3 or 4 wks. they have put proposals in Paris, but none affect
the items subject to quantitative controls which include many in
which we have gt. commercial interest. In Paris at outset we
were all united v. U.S. but in the course of discussions U.S. have
won away many to their side. If we abolish differential, U.S. will
be cross. But if we don’t it will be continuing running sore in
US/U.K. relns. Strong support in H/C. Propose that we shd.
announce abolition of differential but promise to continue to cooperate
in Chincom – and m’tain control of trade to Soviet and
China on same basis.
P.T. If we accept compromise, we shall be subject to continuing trade
pressures on individual cases and shall damage US/UK relns. more
in long run than by one main row.
D.S. Better to get it over – General agreement in that sense.
P.M. Presentn. Protest at once (U.S. Amb. in Ldn) against U.S. action on
wool tariff. * B/T. to provide aide-memoire for For. Secy. *
4. Jordan.
S.Ll. Now looks as tho’ overflying rights will be secured.
130
5. I.L.O. Vocational Training in Agriculture.
Approved.
6. Wages and Prices.
Early discussions not heard.
I.M. We must not be drawn into a representative body.
P.M. Guide them, in talks, twds 3 independent people. And make it clear, in
covering note, tht. they can’t roam over work allotted to other
bodies.
E.H. Party may be sceptical of its value.
I.M. It went pretty well when I explained it to Cttee.
H. Fear “stable prices”.
P.M. We really mean “reasonably stable prices.”
D.S. Re-consider “significance” – it is too wide. *| “reasonable stability of
prices”.
Hail. ? Omit last 6 words.
M. Para. 4 of App. It shd. be linked with Ct. of Enquiry.
I.M. T.U.’s will be in diffy. if asked directly to swallow Geddes. We cd.
wrap it up and indicate tht. it has long bn. under considn. before
Geddes recommended it.
Agreed. P.T. and I.M. to prepare memo. and consult with two
two sides of industry.
Omit [“High and stable level of” emplt. vice “full”]
7. Europe: Free Trade Area.
P.T. Talks in Bonn (Adenauer) and Ldn. (Faure) gave us reasonable ground
to expect that they wd. go on twds free-trade area after ratificn. of
Rome Treaties.
Time table has bn. extended, however, as result of fall of Fr. Govt.
Have seen officials (O.E.E.C.) and agreed tht. in July will meet heads of
Delegns. in Paris and get interim report. P’pone mtg. on free trade
area until Sept. : and aim at negotns. in Oct/Nov.
131
Agriculture: make no move at all now. If made, do it late when there
is a Fr. Govt. and when we can get some quid pro quo.
Commonwealth consultation. With senior officials after P.M.M.
S.Ll. Concerned at delay (because doubts may grow), but seems inevitable.
Suspect French : believe G. assurances were genuine. Denmark :
danger tht. they may go into Common market. Can we give
some private re-assurance to Scandinavian Govts
Diffy. : assurances on agriculture.
P.T. Uniscan Mtg. on Derby Day.
P.M. Cd. we not say tht. free trade area wd. be formed on basis that it
excluded agriculture : but that need not prevent some members
(not ourselves) from makg. such arrangemts. with the 6 Powers
as suited them.
D.E. Capital reconstruction on Continent is formidable. Capitalists using
German know-how: may be a hedge v. Communism in other
European countries. We can’t afford to be left out of this.
Since Faure’s visit, no improvemt. in Fr. obstructive attitude in w.
party. Diffies. are so great that it is full-time job for a M/State.
Conflicts of interest (w’in U.K. industries or U.K. and
Commonwealth) are too difficult for officials.
How do we handle French? Concede points as we go along. Or draw
up a fair Treaty with others and then make separate concessions to
French alone. They are the grit in the oyster.
P.T. In the end we shall prob. do this.
P.M. Let us think this all over.
P.T. to consider what mght be said to Scandinavians.
[Enter Perth.
8. Malta.
P. Stated latest position.
K. If Mintoff publishes Tues., we must be ready to publish our reply.
Better therefore for P.M. to see to-morrow evening Labour
Members of Round Table Conferences.
Malta m’tain tht. repn. at W’minister must be accompanied by
guarantee tht. comparable living standards will be secured by a
given time.
P.M. That is different from promising same standard of social services.
P.T. But we are not guaranteeing that either.
132
P.M. Cd. we have, during the 5 years, a sort of Chandos to advise and assist on
development. As an addn. to the £25 M. subvention. Put that to
Mintoff formally by letter before Wh. Paper publd.
P.T. Accept that, on basis tht. his function will be to get industry to go there
etc., – not to assess how much money we shd. put in.
9. Civil Aviation.
H.W. Concerned at implementg. promises given by predecessors to independent
air-lines. Brought to a head by Central Afr. Airways P.Q.’s.
Must speak now to Cttee. of Party.
Want i) to relieve them of requirement to fly sub standard aircraft.
ii) to put trooping contracts on longer term basis.
iii) C. African complex.
K. No harm in making these soundings.
