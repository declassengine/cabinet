C.C. 34(57). 15th April, 1957.

1. Cyprus. [Enter O.G., E.H.
A.L.B. No objn. to what T. Govt. are proposing to say.
S.Ll. Will so inform Turks.
2. Jordan.
S.Ll. King seems to have won 1st. round.
Desiderata : pol. support from Saud : mil. help fr. Iraq. Have
tried to set both in motion.
Awkward ques for us : what do we do if he asks us for help? Armd.
regiment cd. look after themselves. Risky to use R.A.F. at
Mafraq unless assured that Iraq wd. move in to cover them v.
reprisals.
P.M. Ques i) what reply to such a request fr. the King?
ii) how do we protect our people in J.
iii) what do U.S. and Fr. say re appln. of tripartite decln.
D.S. R.A.F. at Mafraq cd. look after themselves, unless v. heavy armd.
attack. 30 Venoms cd. be sent fr. Cyprus.
Armd. regt. cd. look after itself, and, if requd., cd. reach Amman in 24 hrs.
100 odd Br. civilians remaing, who mght seek evacuation. Valettas cd.
do it from Habbaniyah, if un-obstructed. Para. 7 of Amman 64
S.Ll. We shd. not get involved in this alone. All turns on Iraq intentns. I
have asked for informn. about their mil. plans – we must await
answer to F.O. Tel. 995 to Bagdad.
On evacuation, we shd. make prepns. – but do no more pro tem.
P.M. Entry of Iraq shd. not automatically involve us.
But, if King is overthrown, it will be victory for Syria and Egypt.
And, if J. disintegrates, Israel v. likely to intervene.
R.A.B. Yes : Tel. 654 Amman is disquieting.
P.M. Consider to-day what financial loss wd. be involved in w’drawing
from Mafraq.
Also make sure they will organise a stiff resistance – ? send a reliable
officer.
S.Ll. Attitude of Israel – no interference if confined to internal : but wd. reconsider
if foreign troops moved in. Risk therefore they may react
on an intervention by Iraq – as last October. Propose to ask
96
French to urge Israel to wear that because wd. be intervention
against Syria and Egypt. Agreed.
S.Ll. Reply from Bagdad received. King has asked for mil. help from Iraq,
who will now send forces to A. Z. Nuri is also urging Saud that
they shd. act together to save J. from Communism.
Nuri thinks Anglo/U.S. role now shd. be to restrain Israel. But, if
Syrian forces came in, Iraq wd. need air support – and might ask
for Venoms from Cyprus.
P.M. We cd. not promise that w’out much thought.
J.M. W’ton 895 seems to show that Eisenhower doctrine is w’out meaning.
S.Ll. We shd. suggest to U.S. that clear statement from them of what they
wd. do in given circs. wd. be valuable stabilising factor. Tho’
that mght stimulate R. to come out publicly on other side.
P.M. May I have up-to-date view on appln. of tri-partite declaration. We
shall be asked in H/C.
S.Ll. Favour formal enquiry to W’ton and Paris – wtr circs. require consultn.
under t. decln.
3. Suez Canal.
S.Ll. W’ton 900. E. offer :- (Changes fr. earlier draft).
i) Tolls. Offer to go to arbitration on any increase above 1%
p.a. This is not an unreasonable offer.
ii) Canal Code. Offer to arbitrate on changes, if challenged.
This also is an advance.
iii) Arbitration procedure – in para. 8.
iv) Compensation – arbitration is accepted.
Cd. be said that this covers 5 of the 6 principles. The one not wholly
covered = insulation from politics of any one country. That is
arguable.
More difficult point. This = unilateral decln., not an agreement. Final
sentence of tel. – cd. they unilaterally w’draw this and substitute
another. F.O. legal adviser is considerg. that.
Dillon doesn’t think it satisfy. – presumably because of last point.
Hail. How wd. an arbitral decision unfavourable to E. be enforced? That is
the crux. There is no sanction. We really need provn. for
w’holding of dues.
H.W. An effective SCUA mght be able to enforce in that way.
S.Ll. No : for ships w’holdg. dues wd. be declined facilities.
97
S.Ll. Security Council. U.S. may now argue tht. they must go to S.C. jointly
x| with E. N. Yk. 955. We had never supposed U.S. wd. concert
| with E. an approach to S.C.
Time is slipping. We wanted report to S.C. made to-day.
P.M. We shd. press U.S. to go on with original plan. x/ is not firm : Tel. is a
y| little ambiguous.
H.W. Art. 102. point. Several countries will accept this declaration. When
they have done so, will it not rank as an internatl. agreemt.
P.M. Doubt that. Anyhow, first proceed as at y/.
And let our use of Canal be de facto, pending a more statify. settlement.
H.W. One or two large ships will prob. pass thro’ Canal by end of week.
German certainly : and prs. some others. If they go thro’, these
countries will resume transit.
Agreed : Urge U.S. to proceed with our plan.
4. Nuclear Tests.
S.Ll. We have w’drawn our acceptce. of compulsory jurisdn. of Internatl. Ct.
in order to substitute a new form of acceptance, with condns.
which will evade an injunction by Ct.
Position to-day therefore is that no-one can bring us to Court.
Comparable action taken over Buraimi. [Exit S.Ll.
5. Oil Supplies.
P.M. Proposal : to end rationing on 17/4.
Political ques. Will it seem weak?
My personal view : dislike doing this at moment when we try to make
arrangemt. for de facto transit of Canal. Suppose Nasser makes
diffies. over that? Or suppose Syria cuts pip-eline? We have bn.
buying oil from any source – we cdn’t afford to go on doing that,
and if real trouble blew up in M/E. we shd. have to ration for
financial reasons.
R.A.B. On balance – because of events in M/E. and dollar purchase – we
ought to keep it on for a bit longer.
I.M. I agree.
P.T. So do I.
H.A. So do I. V. bad if we had to re-impose it later.
98
H.W. We can’t hold it for v. long – evasion is w’spread.
Agreed : retain rationing pro. tem.
Announcement to be made in H/C. to-day.
6. Wilton Park.
O.G. Decided last year – on basis tht. it was useless to try to teach G. to be
democrats. G. were however v. disappointed and pressed for
continuance. Suggn. emerged of continuing it on basis enlarged
to cover Europe vice G. alone. Some countries are ready to
contribute to its cost. An important and inexpensive instrument of
propaganda.
P.T. We have bn. trying to close this since ’45. At last, in ’56, it was
decided to let it go. Lease has bn. released – prepns. made to
close.
H.B. Remarkable place – due to genius of Warden, who is German. Can he
run a European institn.? If not, who will be its leader.
P.M. Wd. prefer to leave this open until we have completed our review of
overseas propaganda. Suggest we renew lease for one more year.
Agreed : Renew lease for one year.
Cost to be kept this year w’in F.O. budget.
7. Shops Bill.
R.A.B. Re-commit on 6/5 and make amendments to liberalise it. Then, when
it comes to H/C., I will take responsibility of saying in H/C. that
we can’t carry it.
Hail. Bill is not as bad as represented. Diff. for me and for H/L. if its throat
is to be cut in H/C. But agree H/L. shd. not be responsible for
killing a Bill wanted by T.U.’s.
Therefore I don’t want to re-commit save under pressure from Opposn.
– and after warning them it may mean loss of Bill.
I.M. T.U.’s want this Bill. Tories in H/C. won’t wear it. May get worst of
both worlds if we make in H/L. concessions which will upset
T.U.’s and then cut its throat in H/C.
Surely it is easier to drop a bad Bill than a good one. Also avoid 2
rows with T.U.’s.
Hail. Majority of amendments must be tabled in H/Lds because promises
given on Cttee.
99
P.M. Better for Govt. to kill it.
Hail. But I have repeatedly said we are going on with it. I must try to get it
thro’ H/L. and make it appear that it is only lack of time that has
lost it.
I.M. But don’t include any amendmts which haven’t bn. promised.
R.A.B. Will re-consider amendmts. with that in view.
8. Remuneration of Doctors and Dentists. [Enter D.V.
P.M. Will make statement on Tues. Will cover exchange of letters with
Coll. Physicians: also statement by Chairman of P.C. Will
announce interim award – and offer to discuss (not consult)
distribution.
On amount of interim I believe on reflectn. we shd. stand on 5%.
D.V. Accept that. But cd. date be earlier than 1/7 – e.g. 1/5.
C.H. 5% on gross remuneration = 7% or more on net. This shd. be stressed
with g.p.’s.
