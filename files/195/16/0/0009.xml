C.C. 7(57). 5th February, 1957.

1. Government Expenditure : Social Services. [Enter E.H.,Vosper, B.C.
H.M. Increased charges or contribns. are similar to increased taxn. – i.e. they
force people to spend less on other things.
1) Genl. agreemt. in Cab. to £12 M. for welfare milk – half price.
2) If pressed, we cd. get £1¾ M. on orange juice etc.,
3) School-meals at 1/= wd. yield £3½M.
I wd. sooner do 1) and 3).
Then choice : Fam. Allowance (£40) : Dental Service (£20) : New
stamp for N.H.S.
We face continuing problem, not that of a single year. First 2
alternatives are once for all. First, moreover, if coupled with 1)
and 3) above wd. lay whole burden on children. Points to third.
Insurance principle has gt. hold on public mind – cf. friendlies
etc., before State insurance came in. N.H.S. is gt. boon to middle
classes (clerks etc.,) – shd. keep it universal, but make contribn. a
bigger feature. Beveridge assumed ⅓rd. cost from contribns. :
now only 1/12th. Flexible instrument for future. Better than
once-for-all measures.
I therefore favour reducg. N.I. stamp by 10d/and introduce N.H.S. stamp
for 1/6. Net charge of 8d. shdn’t seem much to people in view of
Labour plans for pensions. This wd. be around £30 M. or more.
Adminve. ques. Employers needn’t contribute, but shd. have oblign. to
stamp cards. Universal – no opting out because feckless.
By these means we cd. save £30 M. at least plus £17 from 1) and 3).
P.T. Exp’re over-stretched in defence, social services and investment. We
face deficit wh. will have serious effect on £.
Can’t get economies needed on defence alone.
Agree we had better drop (2) : Do 1) and 2) : yielding £15 M. against
increase of £280 M. that won’t look enough. Must be bolstered
up by sense of realism – for which we need both N.H.S. contn.
and block grant.
My only doubt arises fr. fact that we face need, later to do somethg.
much more drastic over s. services as a whole and esp. pensions.
If we can separate N.H.S. from N.I., it will be gt. advantage. Must be
sure first there is prospect of defensible scheme. If we can’t be
sure, we shall have to forecast action w’out promising it. Can’t
risk adminve. muddle.
B.C. Can’t yet see for certain that adminve. diffies. can be overcome.
Workers don’t see cards : only deduction on pay slip. Additional
trouble for employers.
Contributory basis for N.H.S. What about those exempt – old and poor
– are they to be denied benefit.
P.M. No.
33
[B.C.] Sanctions for self-employed?
These are only adminve. ques. Real objn. is impending deficit on N.I.
Fund - £40 M. next year rising to £400 in 1971. How much can
we get fr. increased contribns.? Matter of judgment. I wd. prefer
to wait.
D.V. Diffies. are greater for B.C. than for me. I favour getting insurance
principle more clearly emphasised.
Separate card would be administratively severe. Separate stamp on
same card – or over-printing. Recognise tht. people don’t see
their cards.
Orange juice : take-up is only 30% of entitlement. Wd. have bn. ready
to do it. Waste.
A.L.B. Contract to take it fr. W. Indies until 1960.
D.V. Support P.M.’s approach on N.H.S.
H.A. Support P.M. Warning tht. 1) may make it more diff. to get rid of our
milk production.
On N.H.S. I wd. aim at 50% fr. contribns. eventually. Wonder wtr 2/=
cdn’t be managed vice 1/6d. for 1st. step.
I.M. Favour principle. B.C.’s diffies. will be easier if N.I. and N.H.S. are
separated. 1/6d. is reasonable start : 3/7d. wd. be ⅓rd.
Must be compulsory as I.I. contn. is.
Prefer separate stamp – for presentn.
Don’t allow it to affect entitlement. Burden of sick shd. be carried by
the fit.
L.P. Strong support for N.H.S. plan.
May be 1st. step twds. puttg. s. services on more realistic basis.
M. Support. But is it right to reduce N.I. stamp by 10d. when Fund is
running into red.
R.A.B. Support. But some day we shd. consider 3rd. element – investment esp.
by natd. industries.
P.M. Approve N.H.S. plan in principle.
Adminve. diffies. to be examined.
Agreed. Approve 1) and 3) at outset.
P.T. Leave over amount of new stamp for final decision later.
H.B. 4 m. households will face increased rents in Oct. Large families
cannot take much more. Mght be better to do 1) and 2) which
wd. run together as one, rather than 3).
34
P.T. Won’t give me the savings – esp. if we can’t sell what we have
contracted to buy.
Agreed P.T. to have discretion as between 2) and 3) and higher
value for stamp.
[Exit B.C. D.V.
2. Local Government Finance.
H.B. Opinion in l. govt. is strong tht. educn., on specific grant, has eaten up
too much. Expected that somethg. will be done to cut this back
as result of review.
This cdn’t operate before Apl. 1958. Wd. be 1961 before results in
App. began to appear. Review inevitable before then.
Not our object to freeze educn. exp’re. at present level. We shd. fix
formula for amount for ’58-’61. Recognise need for expansion :
but must introduce economical adminn. as a safeguard.
Salaries of teachers, admittedly, are fixed : but no. employed is at
discretion of l.a.’s.
Education is large element in total of block grant. But nothg excluded
wh. cd. be brght in save police grant. Wd. be imposs. to include
housing subsidies or road grants.
Hail. Can add little to what I said before and my written memo. Also 2nd
leader in Times.
Delusion to suppose tht. there is substantial waste of educn. or, if there
were, tht. this scheme wd. reduce it.
No. of teachers. Surely we can’t believe teacher/pupil ratio is
satisfactory. Govt. policy = to reduce it.
What this does is to transfer control over educational policy from
M/Edn. to Municipal Treasurer. Fallacy here is that latter will be
more effective under general grant than is that of M/Edn. under
specific grant.
H. Percentage of total cost repd. by salaries?
Hail. About 60% for teachers alone : plus 10% on other immovables.
D.S. Hail.’s view strikes at root of l. govt. principle. Central Govt. shd. not
be in a posn. to enforce execution of policies by l.a.’s. Essence of
independent l.a. govt. is that some must be more efficient than
others. W’out that l. govt. becomes lifeless and l. elections
meaningless. Standards of educn. shd. be m’tained by local
interest.
J.S. General grant for Scotland wd. be £36 M. of which £33 M. wd. be for
education.
Wd. have to seek other means of co-ercing backward l.a.’s.
No maldistribution of teachers in Scotland.
35
Status of l.a.’s. Real problem = find people who can spare time. Genl.
grant wdn’t help us in this.
I.M. Close connection with Item 1. Support P.T.’s need for it. Education
lobby is formidable – and will raise a big row. But this is best
hope for economical adminn. by l.a.’s.
H.W. Wd. it be feasible, in educn. as in roads, to reserve a small element of
grant to central Govt.
C.H. Support D.S. Will be accepted as a move to restore independence of l.
govt. And welcomed on that a/c despite education lobby.
D.E. Not much good to P.T. unless it saves money.
R.A.B. Believe this may be less distasteful to M/E. than revising his specific
grants.
AMC have said they prefer block grant to equalisation system. Also in
their Journal they have welcomed change wh. accords with this
plan.
Must reduce l.a. expenditure on educn.
P.T. Close connection with Min. 1. Must demonstrate real effort to check
increasing expend’re. This isn’t a cut : it is a check on growth.
People are more careful in spending own money than other
people’s.
Agree with D.S. and Ch. H. Can present this as giving more life to l.
govt.
H.W. Ready to surrender £20 M. below line on my natd. indies.
E.H. Political objns. to this. May lead to increased rates – v. sensitive
politically.
P.T. This will give life to local elections – a great and urgent need.
H.A. Fear this will be disappointing in practice. Will increase pressure to
transfer exp’re. to rates. On balance, will be more unpopular than
popular with Tories. But wd. accept majority view.
H.B. Timing. Awkward tht. we have Rating and Dev. Bill 2nd. Rdg. on Thurs.
Will be criticised because doesn’t include any industrial derating.
I wd. wish at least to say, in that debate, tht. there will be
comprehensive legn. : this is ad hoc Bill : we shan’t get rating
right until all property is rated 100%. of value, however long it
takes to reach that position.
This major Bill wd. be next Session.
P.T. What I wd. prefer is statement by H.B. before 18/2 forecasting intentn.
in genl. terms on block grant and on re-rating.
36
Ch.H. First reference to re-rating shd. be as precise as possible.
H.B. Cd. promise on Thurs. a more comprehensive statement on Mon.
P.M. Two aspects. 1) Re-rating up to50% in Bill next Session. Shd. say so
publicly soon. Needn’t decide yet how the £25 M. is to be
divided betwn. Exchequerand l.a.’s.
2) Block grant. Educationists will represent it as reactionary.
But percentage grant dates fr. period when l. govt.
dominated by property and central govt. were trying to tempt them
to spend. This is hardly true to-day. P.T. wants to represent this
as means of getting exp’re under control. Needn’t be repd. as a
cut. In l. govt. opinion, a balance betwn. educationalists and
those who value independence of l. govt.
P.T. On an increase of £280 M. in civil expenditure, it’s not enough to say
I’m raising more cash (2/= N.H.S. stamp and re-rating) and only
curbing exp’re by £15 M. Must have this as an addl. method of
curbing exp’re.
H.M. Must ask for unity in support of P.T.
But wd. like to take decision on Thurs. in light of draft statements to be
made by H.B. (two) and P.T., so that we cd. judge the presentation.
[i.e. H.B. on Thurs. and Mon. P.T. on 18/2.]
3. House of Commons : Members’ Fund.
P.T. As in memo.
R.A.B. x/ Re-consider para. 4.
P.T. If we can do it w’out repercussions.
H.B. Trustees are content with para. 4. Now that amount is to go as high as
£500 p.a.
P.M. y/ Timing – do it with general packet on salaries.
Agreed : subject to x/ and y/.
4. Ghana.
C. D. and W. Fund.
H. Sw. compromise wd. be inconsistent with earlier Act.
Propose therefore to defend clause as it stands. Hope we can get it
thro’.
37
Independence Celebrations.
P.T. Was asked for £55.000, includg. £35.000 on 4 Valiants for fly-past.
Surely the Valiants are too much.
A.L.B. U.S. and Soviets are sending jets. Unwise for us not to be repd. in the
air.
Ready to forego Army band.
S.Ll. Training flights. Need it be a net additional cost?
P.T. £35.000 total : no more.
5. Broadcasting : Party Political Broadcasts.
R.A.B. I.T.A. have refused to take Party political b’casts from B.B.C.
Oppn. have suggd. legn. to compel I.T.A. to do this.
Are we going too far in threatening this.
C.H. V. diff. to implement such a threat.
P.M. Seek to use persuasion on I.T.A.
6. Suez Canal : British Refugees.
P.M. Read draft statement to be made in H/C. Approved.
