C.C. 48(57). 24thJune, 1957 : 6.30 p.m.

1. Suez Canal : British Evacuees. [Enter E.H.
Note not taken.
2. Oversea Information Services.
P.M. B.B.C. – four points, of which three shd. be welcome to them.
Finance – plan on basis of £15 M. ceiling when all fully effective.
capital (£5½ M over 5 years).
Problem to be resolved : how capital exp’re is to be handled.
Ch.H. i) We have examined Drogheda, as well as new, proposals.
ii) This report deals only with services on open Votes.
iii) Report deals with structure only : much remains to be done on
co-ordinn.
P.T. Much to be said for expansion on this if there is contraction elsewhere.
No sign of latter.
£15 M. is on lavish side.
This shd. be subject to detailed Ty. scrutiny.
Services to Europe are over-done. Common European “desk” wd. be
more economical.
If costs rise, no service can be exempt from cuts.
Ready to consider capital expenditure outside the £15 M.
S.Ll. Can we not have a “ration” instead of normal Ty. control.
Ch.H. Control is too detailed – and delays long.
Form of announcement of decisions – short White Paper.
3. Cyprus.
S.Ll. i) Spaak goes to G. and T. on 29/6 and wants to know what our policy
is. We can’t because of P.M.M. settle it before then. We must
give him temporising answer. Suggested we shd. advise him on
ques wtr he shd. see Makarios. Propose we give none.
P.M. Can remind him that his remit was to discuss with Govts. Tho’ leaving
decision to him.
S.Ll. ii) Our next step. T. have said they favour 3-Power Conference, and
want us to summon it. Advantages. Invitn. mght fill gap in
which we determine policy. Suggest F.O., C.O. and M/D. shd.
consider in what terms invitn. shd. be extended if we decided to
send one.
144
Agreed : Col. Policy Cttee. to have authority to approve
invitation.
4. Dollar Expenditure.
D.E. Amended list involves between £2-3 M. vice £10 M. as under previous
proposals.
Statement next week, to enable Canadians to be informed in advance.
P.T. E.P.C. have considered and approve.
Agreed.
5. Local Government Finance.
H.B. Outstanding ques : shd. l.a.’s benefit at all from £30 M. accruing from
re-rating. Under present proposals l.a.’s as a whole wd. gain
nothing.
L.C.C. is opposed. C.C.A. on fence. AMC. are in favour of block
grant. Lesser authies. are in favour of whole plan.
I now propose tht. l.a.’s shd. have £15 of the £30 M. Give them £10 M.
outright and keep £5 M. in reserve to meet hardship under
adjustment of highway grants. With this concession, we cd. expect
general acceptance of the reform by l.a.’s.
Ready to omit statistics on pp 14 - 19 of draft W. Paper.
Publn. next week is necessary.
J.M. Have not had time to prepare our Wh. Paper.
Sc. l.a.’s are all opposed to whole plan. [Exit D.E.
Support plan for giving them the £15 M. Cdn’t hope to get it across in
Scotland without this concession.
May I have authy. to clear Scottish Wh. Paper with M/H.?
P.T. Cdn’t agree to hand over £15 M. Taxes have gone up six-fold since
war : rates have only doubled. Can’t lose a chance of reducg.
burden on Exchequer.
Moreover, involves much more than £15 M. For it sets pattern for full
re-rating when time comes.
Proposal can’t be defendable on principle. Object of scheme was to
reduce l.a. reliance on Exchequer.
Highway grants : was understood tht. adjustment wd. not involve
additional charge on Exchequer.
Prepared, however, to consider transitional easement of some sort.
Plan for paying 90% at once and 10% after audit. Ready to
discuss scheme under which we wd. use part of £30 M to ease
transitional arrangemts. over first 6 years. By leaving with l.a.’s
a propn. of the additional sum, so long as we are not net losers.
£5M over 4 years : or £7½ M over 6 years.
145
P.M. Wd. R.A.B. discuss with P.T., H.B. and J.M., with I.M. [Exit S.Ll.
and H. during P.M. Mtg. And settle without further reference to
Cabinet.
