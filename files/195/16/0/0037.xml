C.C. 46(57). 24th June, 1957.

1. Disarmament. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Procedure – interdepl. orgn. related to assumptn. of unreality of
Lancaster House discussions. Have now formed group of
Ministers. Propose to form corresponding group of senior
officials, under Dean’s Chairmanship.
[Note : Shd. Ty. be represented in some way. ? Makins.]
S.Ll. Package. On conventional disarmament it is harmless – for us. On
nuclear, we have thght it safe to make offers on assumptn. tht. R.
wd. not accept control. R. have now offered inspn. for tests.
Doubt if they will accept it in practice : but we can hardly afford
to refuse this R. offer. xU.S. and France insist tht. suspension shd.
be linked with cut-off of manufacture. R. won’t have the 2 things
associated. They wish to link cut-off with ban on use of nuclear
weapons. Suspension of tests mght. suit us if we had time to
make a few more. Reason for x = to prevent 4th. country
manufacture. I believe this is necessary to stop 4th. countries
coming in.
Suspension – U.S. view. Earliest date for beginning of [Enter R.A.B.
10 month suspension is July ’58. At end of 10 months, further
suspension only if inspn. and control has bn. effectively introduced.
Thereafter, cut-off of prodn. wd. not be brought in for 2 years
after July ’58 viz., 1960 – at earliest.
R. have no intention of acceptg. cut-off. We shd. have to consider later
wtr to accept suspension of tests without a cut-off.
P.M. Stassen gave copy of his proposals to Zorin w’out prior consultn. with
Western Govts. I protested to President : read his note to him.
U.S. have expd. regrets on procedure – but haven’t w’drawn on
substance.
Fact is that, if we cd. make no more tests, we shd. be only an
inefficient nuclear Power. Our bombs wd. be expensive in
material. On other hand mounting world opinion v. continuing
tests. Secondly, on manufacture : if cut-off at dates envisaged,
we shd. be greatly handicapped – not so much on megaton bombs
– but on defensive weapons. Also, our independent f. policy wd.
be jeopardised : for world wd. be divided betwn. the 2 really
great nuclear Powers. U.S. wd. control whole fate of the West.
But U.S. now understand our position. Their cynical interest wd. be to
seek agreemt. for early end of tests and prodn. Their present
readiness to make first conditional on second makes our posn.
easier. On cut-off we have 2 safeguards i) R. won’t accept
control sufficient to cover manufacture, tho’ they may accept
controls over tests. But, if they did give way on that ii) we must
hold U.S. to assurance tht. they will see us thro’ to a reasonable
140
posn. as a 3rd. nuclear Power. Annex B. reserves our right to
claim tht. we shd go on for longer with manufacture.
A genuine agreement, with some independence for us, wd. be gt. gain.
With small no. of offensive weapons under our own control, and
adequate supply of defensive weapons under U.S. key-ofcupboard
to supplement about 1/5th under our own control, we
mght be O.K.
Gt. pressure of opinion. U.S. proposal wd. give us at least 12 months
grace on tests : and opportunity to press U.S. for supplies of
fissile and to decline to sign Treaty if we can’t get that. Some
chance that Congress wd. accept repeal of McMahon Act as part
of satisf. disarmament agreement.
D.S. If plan were wholly executed, R. wd. have overwhelming superiority in
conventional. Assume U.S. don’t intend to let that happen.
Tests – cut-off – dismantling. Are these to be negotiated together?
Then no agreemt. likely for years. Or one after another?
If supply of material were assured, we cd. build up extravagantly a
small stock of megaton bombs. More serious : need chance to
continue tests of kiloton for defensive purposes (g. m. and t.). On
that we must be able to continue tests or to get know-how from
U.S.
Suspension of tests and production wd. knock us right out of being a
nuclear Power.
We must, in this situation, press U.S. to share [Enter Home.
knowledge and supplies. Shd. not be diff. to get agreement with
them re defensive weapons. So long as U.S. are in Europe, wd.
accept key-of-cupboard basis. Doubt if even U.S. have enough
fissile to supply all N.A.T.O. Allies.
[P.M. Agree : for Pentagon will hog so much.]
Annex B. Do we have to accept this before discns. betwn P.M. and Eis.?
If we do, para. 2 refce. to inspn. shd. apply to prodn. of fissile as
well as to tests. Also study in para. 3 shd. cover it.
[P.M. No : that wd. have effect of accelerating stage 2.]
P.M. U.S. take view tht. it wd. be premature to discuss release of fissile
material before we really know wtr R. will accept.
Moreover, if we stress to them the weakness of our nuclear position, it
may strengthen any inclination they may have to write us off as
nuclear Power.
R.A.B. Can we hold Genl. Assembly on basis of Annex B.
S.Ll. A fair chance of holding at least 50% of them.
P.M. Understanding of Jan. was related to supply of fissile only. I want to
get know-how as well, to cover us v. need for further tests.
141
H.A. We can’t say less than Annex B.
P.T. U.S. can’t at this stage promise either of safeguards – material or
know-how.
Hail. We must avoid posn. in which we are at mercy of R. conventional
strength. Our posn. depends on nuclear capacity. If we accept
Annex B., won’t U.S. and R. combine to deprive us of, or deny us,
nuclear capacity. Believe B. may prejudice us.
D.S. We cd. at least say that, in going along with Annex B., we do so in
faith that U.S. will make it possible for us to become a nuclear
Power.
P.M. Will tell President that we are ready to submit B. on followg.
understanding : will he confirm tht. our understandg. is correct.
