C.C. 76 (57) 28th October, 1957

1. Washington Talks. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Gave summary of talks.
U.S. in v. confused state. W.S.C. came to see before I left : reminded
me how he went over after Pearl Harbour and said sputnik had
created same sort of atmosphere. Also stressed need to recover
posn. of Quebec Agreement.
Eis. is quicker and stronger than at B’muda. Dulles in better posn. since
Humphry went.
At our 1st. conversation with D. alone, I said we must move twds.
world government and to my surprise he agreed.
Tho’ we agreed tht. Anglo-U.S. alliance must be the core, we both
recognised that we must work thro’ existg. organisation and
individual friendly Govts.
They know they have only 3 yrs. more to go. They were impressed by
fact that Eis. and P.M. have basis of close co-opn. which their
successors may not have.
U.S. realise now they can’t deal with R. on their own.
Declaration – Keynotes are interdependence : trusteeship of the nuclear
(on which they are groping for some means of institutionalism) :
new stimulus for existg. organisation (to overcome risk of
distinction which is emerging betwn. nations who have nuclear and
those who can only field p.b.i.). Hence suggn. of N.A. Council
mtg in Dec. at Head/Govt. level.
Must m’tain momentum of Anglo-U.S. co-operation.
Outlined agreements for bi-lateral co-opn. : in countering Soviet threat;
and for applying principle of pooled resources in weapon
developmt.
Have agreed on apptmt. of joint w. party on future defence of H.Kong.
In return for all this, I have promised tht. this Govt. will not press
for seating red China in U.N.
They are not fully conscious of significance of U.S. economic policy in
all this. Dulles, if he had his way, wd. favour deliberalisation.
In Canada, all were satisfied with results. We made some sentimental
remarks, ate a lot and drank v. little.
S.Ll. Have now achieved “special relationship” with U.S. Due to H.M.’s
special relation with Eis. Must now see that it is m’tained – spirit
at top must percolate thro’ machine.
2. East-West Trade.
S.Ll. U.S. impressed by fat-man/thin-man argument. W. party now establd.
on criteria for strategic controls.
Don’t let us mention existence of these.
215
1. Washington Talks (contd.)
S.Ll. Common Market. Eis. doesn’t see that high-tariff C. Market wd. be
worse than none. Worth another message.
Support Costs. U.S. will p’pone for 2 wks – to give us chance to make
progress with G. on ours.
Quid pro quo. for atomic etc., co-opn. i) Air-routes. We must look and
see what concessions we mght make.
ii) China controls : voyage
licensing and bunkering. Awkward to make changes now which
U.S. will regard as favouring Chinese. If we must do this, shd.
be done quickly.
Syria. Preferred plan is off : Arabs won’t play. Unilateral action by
Turks won’t do – mainly because the Govt. they put in cd. not
hope to last after they w’drew. Plan now is to strengthen friendly
Arab countries, assist them to penetrate politically in Syria :
details to be worked out with us (containment plus).
R.A.B. Congratns. of Cabinet on results of mission. Govt. haven’t yet got full
credit for it. Suggest P.M. shd. make short statement in H/C. tomorrow
and promise to develop it further in debate on Address.
U.S. view of R. intentions?
S.Ll. Agreed intelligence appreciation. Three years during wh. R. wdn’t
accept risk of major war. But K. is unpredictable. If his prestige
became involved too deeply, he mght act.
3. Queen’s Speeches.
(i) Prorogation. Draft agreed.
(ii) Opening.
Paras 3/4. Add reference to P.M.’s visit to W’ton – after para. 3.
Para. 7. Add some reference to support of all sections for these
purposes. e.g. These purposes must command support of
all sections of community.
Approved – subject to these and other amendments.
4. Rhodesia and Nyasaland – Federation.
H. As in memo.
There will be pol. trouble here and in Fedn. But more still if we objected
to this legn. Recommend we incur lesser of the two evils.
P.M. i) Thanks to H. for tour and b’ground memo.
ii) Can we p’pone action until after Debate on Address.
216
H. Difficult : for Fed. Govt. want Election in June. On timing I must lay
not later than 31/x/57.
I doubt if they will in fact seek debate during Address, tho’ there may
be individual speeches.
P. Support memo. We have no grds. for objecting to measure – it is not,
as alleged, a differentiating measure.
[Exit P.
5. Interception of [Telephone] Communications.
P.M. Propose to publish.
This does not cover activities of S. Service. I have gone into these
with S.Ll. and R.A.B. and procedures will not conflict with this.
Approved.
