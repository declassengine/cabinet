C.C. 59(57). 30th July, 1957.

1. Disarmament. [Enter E.H.
S.Ll. F. Dulles has come over to supervise Stassen. We have agreed on next
phase. Aim to get Sub-Cttee. adjourned and w. parties to be set up
to work out details of western plan.
Looks as tho’ Julius Holmes sent S.O.S. for Stassen to be brought back
to U.S. party line. Stassen thght to be hoodwinked by R.
“Open skies” plan : need is first to work out system – not to say where
it shall be exercised.
P.M. We shd. try to bring it out that U.S./U.K. are trying to make progress.
Show that w. Powers are not behind R. in seeking means of
agreement. Ch. Hill to consider means of putting this over, on
F.D.’s departure.
2. Cyprus.
a) Conference.
S.Ll. Seen T. Amb., who accepted readily. The Turk. P.M. was less
enthusiastic. But shd. be O.K.
Caccia saw F.D., who asked for time. Here he is unbriefed and evasive.
But we must pin him down.
Spaak has promised support.
Once F.D. is in line, we can approach Gks and make genuine effort to
persuade them to attend.
b) Military.
P.M. Enclaves are becoming more numerous.
D.S. But isolated points are v. small and uninhabited.
My view is that U.K. shd. assume responsibility for defence of Island
as whole.
H. Difficult to m’tain sovereignty over the isolated spots.
P.M. Perpetual lease wd. give us all we really need. Consider now wtr B.
sovereignty cd. be limited to 2 main areas and rest under perpetual
lease (on anology of U.S. Bases in Caribbean). Examine this v.
background of triple sovereignty collapsing.
A.L.B. Claim to sovereignty over Nicosia wd. wreck chance of our plan being
accepted.
S.Ll. I wd. sooner claim larger enclave at Dhekelia. Wd. look better.
175
A.L.B. V. good land : if you took whole peninsula.
P.M. Presentn. : these are places we must retain under our sole control.
Leave it there for argument wtr basis in some cases can be lease
vice sovereignty.
c) Constitutional.
P.M. Functions suggd. for N.A.T.O. shd. be given to named Powers
members of N.A.T.O.
K. Defence. If NATO were ready to express concern, they mght ask U.K.
to act on their behalf.
On para. 13., I wd. prefer (b).
D.S. N.A.T.O. will be hesitant because of para. 10. – Bagdad Pact.
R.A.B. You can’t ensure that population will not rise up eventually and make
it unworkable.
*Financial and trade implications to be examined by officials.*
3. Legislative Programme.
R.A.B. Authy. needed to prepare 2 L. Govt. Bills : small Bill on H/L. reform :
1st. Pensions Bill : Tariffs Bill and Milford Haven.
K.’s memo. on Emergency Powers. Proposes legn. next session on
land powers. Suggest we prepare that Bill, incldg. open-cast
mining.
Also some smaller social Bills e.g. Child Adoption.
Colonial Bills : Malta and Singapore.
This wd. leave over for later decision : 2nd. Pensions, Agricultural
tenure.
And, finally, Betting and Gaming. On this opinions are seriously
divided. Only grounds for proceeding : pledge and morale of
Police. My view : enough trouble w’out embarking on this.
Bookmakers may be willing to give voluntary levy to racing.
H.W. Park Lane Bill.
R.A.B. Cd. be worked in.
I.M. Factories Bill – for last session – will incorporate Gowers on Rlways.
Ch.H. Against Betting and Gaming. Establishmt. of betting shops wd. stir up
v. gt. controversy esp. among non-conformists.
I.M. If we drop it this time we can’t do it next.
176
H. Don’t underestimate corrupting effect of status quo. Brings law into
contempt. Non-conformist conscience is less powerful, and more
reasonable, than it was. Cdn’t we have the Bill prepared.
H.B. Disposed to agree. Why did we give pledge before?
H.W. Avoid legn. which divides our own Party.
P.M. Wd. like to see Heads of Bill before we finally decide. Also to see
proposals re Wolfenden Rpt. which raises same problem of
corruption of police and is more likely to command public
support.
