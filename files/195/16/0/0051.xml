C.C. 62(57). 27th August, 1957.

1. Free Trade Area : Agriculture. [Enter R.M., Profumo.
R.M. Approval sought for general line w’in existg. policy.
Can’t m’tain exclusion of agriculture altogether. But no-one is
proposing free trade for agriculture – the Six contemplate
managed marketing etc., on model of 20th. cent. socialism. Tho’
we can’t do that, we shall have to give them somethg.
Institutions : the 6 will press us to join : our agric. policy wd. then be
subject to majority vote. That wd. not be acceptable.
Specific commitments on certain commodities e.g. wine.
These ques are being considered. At present, we make only limited
proposals in para. 24. These mght be offered, eventually, as a
package.
H.A. V. good memo. Agree with what R.M. has said. Diffy = timing.
Want to know how they are going to work their managed market.
Favour idea of separate statute. Most diff. area for concessions
will be horticulture. Cdn’t abolish quotas on apples and pears until
we had some safeguard in its place. Minimum price technique
mght be solution therefore we are studying that, i.e. free imports
when home prices reach a defined limit. We may have to define
our expansion aim e.g. no further increase in gross production.
Wd. like to get J. Turner into the negotiations on our behalf.
P.T. Qua Commonwealth, we ought to get waiver of provisions in favour of
their products. But we mght have to give heavy price in return.
Some C. interest in 90% of food imports.
Continental attack won’t be v. our farmers but v. our cheap food policy.
They want us to fit into high price level of Eur. agriculture.
This is a managed Socialism.
M. Thght our policy was to be self-supporting in food and cheap. This
alarms me.
J.M. Diff. to reconcile even this sort of concession with Tory Members’
statements. Impn. is plain tht. f. t. area won’t touch agric. at all.
Will need v. clear and careful presentn.
R.M. Stress continuation of O.E.E.C. vice new f. t. area departure.
H. Memo. refers to Europeans (not us) being satisfied tht. there is, in any
foodstuff, a substantial Commonwealth interest.
P.M. That shd. be a matter of fact, not judgment. Or our judgment.
H. Standing Comm. Cttee. e.g. of H. Commrs.While negotns. continue.
186
P.M. Useful.
R.M. Prs. I shd. go to Ottawa.
D.E. Tactics. Fr. have succeeded in makg. agric. problem appear to be one
of extractg. somethg. fr. U.K. We shd. come in as champion of
fringe Europeans who will be damaged by managed market of
the Six. – even by giving them a better share of U.K. market.
We must be free to determine our agric. policy.
We shd. do nothg. for agric. in Europe wh. we don’t do for agric. in
Comm. If our apples and pears are to suffer, Canada not Italy shd.
benefit.
If we are to have managed marketing, tariffs are no longer needed. We
needn’t offer or ask for concessions in tariffs.
P.T. But we need tariffs for Comm. products – to protect them.
D.E. Para 24 I (c) – is not important to Europe. No need to re-assure them.
Increased prodn. p. acre is by no means at an end. Don’t lose the
advantage, in cheaper food, by freezing the position.
R.A.B. – thro’ P.M. – is disturbed. Wants to avoid entanglement. Alarmed by
para 26. But it is mainly presentn. because people have assumed
tht. agric. will be firmly excluded.
P.M. Three points emerge : a) We must present any agreemt. on agric. as
somethg. quite diff. from the f. t. area for industry. A wholly
separate Statute. And extension of what we are doing already
under O.E.E.C. Recognise, ourselves, tht. damage will be not to
our producers but to consumers thro’ dearer food.
b) Bring Comm. into assocn. R.M. shd. go to
Ottawa. Standing Comm. Cttee.
c) Avoid U.K. being isolated as target for
criticism by Six. Other Europeans have same interests as we.
The Six wdn’t admit e.g. Denmark to their managed market.
d) Get J. Turner on our Delegation. Informal
talk between him and R.M.
e) Care over para. 24(v). Stress uneconomic and
bring in reference to corresponding policies of others and
deliberate act of policy.
Agreed : work to proceed on this basis.
2. Commonwealth Economic Affairs.
a) Meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers.
187
P.T. Canadian memo. pretty thin as a basis for Comm. Econ. Conference.
Can stage one on big issue like preferences or convertibility. But
this is a hopeless miscellany.
Even so, doubt if it can be avoided. Progress with f. t. area etc., will
force some consultns. with Doms.
Recommend therefore we wait on views of others and if general support
for Conference we shd. press for adequate prepn. by officials.
D.E. Not heard.
H. Tactics. Little interest likely from other members. General atmosph.
will be lukewarm. Canada doesn’t care much about other
members : mainly concerned with U.K. Believe we can therefore
avoid Conference. Wide range of subjects needing study : let
officials meet in spring and consider their report before we agree to
Conference. This wd. prs. work with Canada too if we cd.
indicate in advance tht. we wd. like to discuss bi-lateral
U.K./Canada deal.
M. Go for closer U.K./Can. trade association.
P.M. True. Much depends on what we cd. get out of Anglo/C. discussions.
Unless we can see practical results coming fr. that, I wdn’t want
to take too discouraging a line on the other. Must not repulse the
new Can. Govt. whose attitude to U.K. is welcome and healthy –
for U.S. too. In Ldn. Menzies was v. rough with D. He was
grateful for our support – and we shd. continue it.
We, too, may need support with our people as result of our f.t. area
talks.
Don’t therefore take lead in decrying it. Admit there is much to
discuss, incldg. Europe. Let us have Standing Cttee. on that.
Also mtg. of offls. in spring. And don’t exclude Confce. of
Ministers thereafter.
P.M. Let us have a draft memo. on our line.
Don’t let Garner disseminate any doubts.
b) Anglo-Canadian Trade.
P.T. 15% switch to U.K. cdn’t be done w’out Canadian discrimination v.
U.S. Canada cd. achieve it by entering a f. t. area with U.K. This
wd. be to our advantage, tho’ wd. involve repealing duties on
Canadian cars and tractors. But they wd. have to w’draw protn. v.
a wide range of U.K. manufactures.
If she rejected that : we cd. consider, in return for our removing quota
restns., getting them to hold sterling. They might consider it on a
big deal.
P.M. Is it because of politics or practical diffies. tht. you have to take quotas
off U.S. as well as Canada.
188
P.T. Mainly political.
Third possibility wd. be to work, in detail, for some switch of Can.
supply from U.S. to U.K.
D.E. Task is to find some basis on wh. Canada cd. discriminate v. U.S. First
: our commercial relns. with Canada shd. be as close as with
Europe. Therefore float seriously the concept of Anglo-Can. f. t.
area. In long run Can. will have to rely on exchange of
manufactures with U.K.
Holding reserves. Shd. not be advanced as a banking proposition.
Merely a valid reason for justifying their discrimination v. U.S. in
their trade. Not a direct trading bargain for us.
Revive proposal to sell our U.S. securities and re-invest them in
x| Canada – as counterpart to their holding sterling.
M. Don’t believe Canada can accept f. t. area.
P.M. Study x/ with enthusiasm. Cd. we use the money to set up an Anglo-
Canadian investment board.
P.T. We cdn’t bring this off, or any of it, w’out some preparation. Shdn’t F.
Lee go out and have some preliminary discns. with pfficials.
D.E. Diffy. is tht. they haven’t produced any plan for 15% switch – and Can.
officials think it impossible. Easier to broach our plans thro’ a
Minister.
P.M. Lee cd. accompany M/Ag. and open it up.
