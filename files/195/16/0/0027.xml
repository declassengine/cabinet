C.C. 36 (57) 30th April, 1957

1. Procedure.
P.M. Referred to undesirability of statements of public policy being made by
Ministers while travelling abroad – w’out consultn. with or authy.
of colleagues.
2. Suez Canal.
S.Ll. Scua meets this p.m. I shall attend.
Technical enquiry thro’ B/E. re method of payment. B/Egypt have
replied. offering to discuss but adding there are points on No. 1
A/c ………
P.T. Bank of Intern. Settlement meets in Basle. Our repves. wd. normally go
on Saty. Propose to send repve. of B/E. on Friday. Govr. will be
available there on Saty.
D.E. Believe they will want to get sterling in order to get resumptn. of Br.
imports.
H.W. Ch/Shipping wished to divert ships to Canal route on Thurs. last. They
were dissuaded because money for dues not available. If Scua
agreed to-day to de facto use, Br. owners wd. want to divert at
once – a week or 10 days to take effect. Hope therefore that Scua
decn. can be deferred for a day or two.
P.M. Agree. Scua shd. lead a counter-attack : proposals unsatisfactory :
further disn. in S.C. required etc., To play for time until we know
E. answer on financial point.
S.Ll. Best point to put is tht. Sec. Genl. regards E. declaration as revocable.
That is unsatisfactory : it shd. be resolved before we accept any
de facto transit.
Hail. If we were compelled to accept settlement incldg. paymt. in currency
other than sterling, cd. we not then get U.S. support for a boycott
(B’muda).
P.M. Can’t let that posn. arise – we cdn’t accept such a settlement, for it wd.
ruin sterling.
Hail. Any chance of a boycott by tankers alone? (U.S. dry. cargo [Enter R.A.B.
have broken away, but not tankers.)
H.W. Fact is tht. U.S. Govt. can’t control their ship-owners.
101
M. A tanker boycott, even if practicable, will involve our continuing to
pay for our oil in dollars. Cost is about 30 m $ p.month.
H.A. Qua public opinion, play it slow and keep it obscure.
3. Petrol Rationing.
M. Emergency surcharge 1¾d. for wholesalers and 1¾d. for retailers. They
are ready to take 2½d. off when rationing ends : and ready to take
off 1d. at once on account. This was justified partly on a/c of
smaller turn-over. And on that a/c reduction wd. now be
justified.
Agreed. Action to be taken at once by the oil companies.
4. Jordan.
S.Ll. Main hope for Hussein is that U.S. have gone so far in support of him
tht. they can hardly afford now to see him lose.
Our interest is still to hold off and let U.S. play the hand.
Hussein has done better than we feared.
My feeling is one of restrained optimism.
D.S. i) Wd. be helpful if it cd. be known that we had bn. informed of U.S.
intention to send 6th. Fleet.
ii) Delay in getting agreemt. for over-flying rights in Jordan. Very
important to us.
S.Ll. On ii) we still believe we shall get it. For it is to J.’s advantage. Will
consider both i) and ii) and report to Cab. at least on (ii).
5. Industrial Disputes. Engineering and Ship Building.
I.M. Rpts. will issue on Thursday.
Recommns. Second is for industry but wd. be helpful. Shall try to
get it accepted.
Third. Was made in ’54 and at NJAC was damned by
T.U.C. BEC will welcome it again. Want to express support for
it. Risk of so doing : that T.U.’s will oppose it. But, even if they
did, believe we shd. need to go on with it. Thus, propose to issue
statement as in draft.
First. 6½% with valuable condns. but giving 18 mos.
respite from further claims and thus breaking away from annual
increases. “No fresh claim” includes local as well as national. If
we let it be known tht. we wd. prefer 6½% on that basis to 5%
unconditional, we cd. lead them in that direction. Period of
102
stability wd. be v. valuable in other industries. On balance wd.
prefer that.
M. But miners will accept 5%. If other course were taken in engineering,
miners wd. go for 6½% unconditional.
I wd. much prefer to keep to 5%, which is becoming pattern for 1957.
I.M. Believe Mills attaches too little value to condns. They wd. be most
valuable. Moreover, not at all sure you cd. get 5%. And, if you
did, another claim wd. be tabled at once.
P.M. First recommn. is for industry alone. The other two affect national
policy.
H.W. Worth trying to get firm condns. attached to a pay increase. Has never
bn. done [successfully] in U.K. Worth having, even if condns. are
not honoured in full.
Discussions adjourned for general review on basis of P.T.’s
memo.
6. Wages Policy.
P.T. Drew attention to Appendix. Clear that we can’t go on as now.
Remedies. i) Unemployment at level which wd. cause employers to
reject wage claims. But that wd. be about 1m. Not conceivable
tht. a Govt. cd. deliberately seek to create such a level of
unemployment.
ii) Independent body to ascertain level of increased
productivity and fix a figure w’in which wages cd. rise. The
Govt. cd. not stand aloof from it. They wd. have to apply
findings in wages they fix (C. Service etc.,) or influence (natd.
indies.) and put it fwd. in evce. to wages boards etc.,
No successful experience of this method abroad. But
believe that in some form we shall have to try it.
Favour therefore some public blessing of this approach, in comment by
M/L. on Rpts. of Ct. of Enquiry.
Also immedte. w-party to study method.
Influence on T.U.’s – thro’ early mtg. with their leaders (P.M.)
R.A.B. Morris Rpt in ’54 was first glimpse of sanity. Pity it wasn’t followed
up.
A C. Service enquiry (para. 22) won’t be as helpful as impartial body
suggested by M/L. in (iii) of his memo. I wd. do both.
We need a better answer on sanctions. That shd. be studied by both
bodies.
Weakness of memo = impartial body has no sanction to apply.
103
H.A. Stimulatg and timely memo. We are v. near to a national wages policy
and must now move one step further.
Politically: this is moment for a démarche.
Needs : i) source of authoritative economic guidance – preferably
independent.
ii) greater use of arbitration.
iii) greater responsibility for N.J.A.C. – prs. with some
executive functions.
iv) secret ballot.
Both important and urgent.
M. Support R.A.B. Favoured 1954 plan – as source of advice in dealing
with wage claims.
But P.T.’s memo. is dangerous as implying that Govt. shd. take a hand
in this. It wd. invite show-down between Govt. and organised
labour.
H.W. If Govt. promulgates a figure, what happens to conciliation function of
M/Labour.
N.J.A.C. can’t discuss wages. But N.P.A.C.I. can. This issue cd. be
discussed there once a year. H.A.’s point (iii).
D.E. Other countries have done better because i) higher unemployment and ii)
greater readiness to have strikes.
Doubt if P.T.’s memo. wd. work until over full emplt. is over. For
wages earned now are not the minimum : employers attract
labour by higher rates.
The figure for this year, over-all, wd. be nil. But some wages ought to
move – to change relativities etc.,
Also if you create impression that workers can have whole of any
increase in productivity, there will be nothg. left for salaried
classes.
Also : rise or fall in productivity is often due to Govt. policy. E.g. nil
this year because of credit squeeze.
Favour enquiry for educational purposes. But no real substitute for
monetary policy.
I.M. Can’t have national wages policy w’out doing same on dividends and
prices. Nor will it work, so long as labour is scarce.
Govt. shd. certainly keep off a limit.
y/ If there is one, it will be starting point for all claims. And will also
provoke claims in industries when none now made.
Effect on relns. of industry with M/Labour.
Believe we shd. aim at :-
i) period of stability. Go for 12 mos. and try to extend.
* ii) set up Bd. as recommended by Ct. of Enquiry.
iii) concentrate on prices.
Sure that * is cardinal. And I wd. say it at once – on publn. of report of
Ct. of Enquiry.
104
Hail. Strong support for y/.
Teachers, whose productivity can’t be measured, will demand the
average. And industries wh. can show a higher figure will
demand it.
Sanctions. Para. 22. So long as strike can’t be defeated, we are bound
to have inflation. Ought we not to invent a machine to break a
strike.
P.T. Little real difference betwn. me and M/L. For once you do *, Govt.
would have to support its findings and wd. become involved.
Let us at least have our C.S. w. party.
I also favour a mtg. with T.U. leaders.
K. Part vi of Ty. memo. on Price Stability in Full Employmt. (H.M.) But
all measures then suggested come down to mere exhortation. I
think we must now have something more – even if it’s only
exhortn. thro’ other mouths after investigation. Cd. there be an
independent board to examine all these points not only
productivity. How is general economic desideratum put to wages
boards etc.,
Wd. like official examination of proposals for new machinery, and of
effectiveness of methods adopted in foreign countries.
P.M. Valuable discussion. Resume argument on Minute 5.
5. Industrial Disputes (resumed).
P.M. i) Govt. shd. not intervene as between 6½% and 5%.
ii) On general question (Minute 5) – produce comparable graphs for
inter-war years. Also let us see what is happening now on
exports etc., Is the approachg “disaster” so great, save tht. it
reduces the burden on debtors?
Doubt if we can have someone calling Trumps. For it wd.
give to those who wd. never have claimed.
Can we put national considns. to arbitrators? When we tried
it, opposite effect because they were so affronted.
Central independent body may do more harm than good.
First study : cd. we face a rlway strike?
H.W. Also – how remove Communist influence from T.U.’s.
Hail. Desirable that there shd. be public presentation of national interest in
arbitration cases. Not as repve. of Govt. but as impartial witness.
* P.M. Welcome para. 22 study by officials. First task – what wd. be composn
and t. of ref. of such a board.
D.S. Study automatic arbitration – as part of suggested Board.
