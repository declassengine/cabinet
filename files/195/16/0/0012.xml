C.C. 10(57). 11th February, 1957.

1. Farm Price Review. [Enter E.H.
H.A. If we insisted on minimum of £8 M. or still more £3½ M., fear following
consequences:–
We declared 160% above pre-war prodn. as our aim by ’56. We have
reached that point and must determine what further expansion we
need.
We are fixing fair prices for output of £1.200 M M. p.a.
Gt. dissatisfn. last year – removed by long-term assurances. But we gave
assurance tht. w’in that framework annual reviews wd. continue.
Farmers are waiting to see what we do with them. But they are in
a mood to co-operate. Wd. be unwise to wreck that atmosphere.
Over last 3 years price increases have bn. about the same (?).
Net income will be £7 or 8 M lower than last year. But every medium or
small farmer has suffered much larger drop.
Cost increase is equivalent to 3% on output. £15 or 16 M increase wd.
be only 1⅓% on output. Not unreasonable in a year of inflation.
Imposed settlement on basis of £3½ M. increase wd. wreck our chances
of co-opn. by farmers.
If we chose £8 M., offls. cd. develop case on that basis.
Myself, I wd. go higher e.g. to £15 or 16 M.
Petrol and oil. New costs are included, by convention, but it
is for Govt. to decide what weight to give them. This shd therefore
be included, unless we are certain tht. it will cease in next few
months. If we strain convention by excldg. it, farmers will be
entitled to breach convention on their side. I therefore favour
incldg. it as cost increase : tho’ consider how far we recoup it.
That gives £8 M. as starting point in negotn.
P.T. Leave aside pro. tem wtr we start fr. £3½ m. or £8 m.
A critical year. All reserves mobilised. Bank rates and taxation are
stretched to limit. Lookg. for economies, not addl. exp’re.
⅔rds. of net income of farmers is paid by Exchequer. £233 M. subsidy
next year, w’out addn.
Farmers’ income this year as high as any achieved and will be higher next
year.
Increased costs certainly. £15-20 M. of them already absorbed. Others
temporary. Estimate net income will rise by £10 M. w’out any
changes, next year.
Commd. to another £5 M. on cap. grants.
No case for any commodity increase. Milk and eggs are in embarrassing
superfluity.
Long-term assurances compel us to pay £3½ M or £8 M. – in a year
when we wdn’t otherwise pay a penny. Suggest we go no further.
If ever there are to be circs. justifying no more than minimum this surely
is the time for it.
What other industry is guaranteed 97% of income.
45
Agree with para. 14 of H.A.’s memo. This is the year, surely, for
imposed settlement. Say it from outset.
On £3½ M. or £8 M. – unlikely they will pay higher rates for full year.
But, in view of convention, I wd. concede the £8 M. on basis tht. we
recoup ourselves next time for element not used during the year.
R.A.B. Figure is reasonable – tho’ I cdn’t accept argument. N. Ireland expect
£10-15. M. E and W. expect £10 M. We shall do v. well if we settle
at about £8 M.
P.T. If you mean to bargain, you’ll need to start lower – e.g. £3½ M. My
offer of £8 m. is on an interpretn. of minimum.
Agreed: observe convention re petrol: include it as
increased cost.
P.M. The minimum, at £8 M., obviates any charge of breach of faith.
P.T. If we take it on basis of minimum, proceed as in para. 14 – w’out
negotiation.
H.A. Yes : subject to carrying out genuine price review.
Wd. like 2-3 days to consider tactics and take political soundings.
L.P. Fact that ⅔rds of farm incomes are paid by Exchequer shd. be more
widely known – esp. for purpose of wage claims, which have
succeeded on basis tht. industry is prosperous.
H. The more we subsidise, the greater our diffies. with Dom. producers and
consequent loss to our imports.
i) Milk : difficult for N.Z. ii) 4d. for wheat : will that enable us to
honour our recent agreement with Australia.
H.A. Can’t avoid the 4d. on wheat : but it still leaves them with a lower profit.
[ Absent 10 minutes …..]
2. Local Government Finance.
Revised draft of statement considered and amended.
[Exit P.T. and D.E.
3. Meeting at Bermuda.
P.M. Will announce in H/C. to-day. 21-24 March.
St. L. suggd. I shd. go on to Ottawa. Didn’t wish to do that because U.S.
opinion. Now decided that he will come to B’muda.
46
4. Israel.
S.Ll. Best tactics = try to revive Sec. Genl.’s last report. To avoid having to
vote on sanctions resoln.
Since then, have learned tht. State Dpt. are nervous of latter and will
seek to avoid any resoln.
Also learned tht. Pearson is favourg. a more positive resoln.
These are two promising developmts.
P.M. Read a draft memo. which he had prepared for his own guidance.
Right course wd. be simultaneous w’drawal of I. troops (Gaza and
Aqaba) and assumptn. of U.N. responsibility. We shd. therefore
aim at getting that made clear in a resoln. of our own – in order to
show Arabs where we stand. We cdn’t vote for a sanctions resoln.
: but, if we had a positive resoln. on the table, we cd. abstain.
Shd. we leave initiative wholly with Pearson. Or sponsor his resoln. *P.
Dixon to be consulted on this.*
5. Suez Canal.
S.Ll. U.S. are opposed to any arrangement on dues wh. wd. prejudice the ques
of ownership. That means dues shd. not be paid to Egypt. Need
therefore for some international agency – e.g. Int. Bank.
H.W. For this purpose, reasonable to assume Canal will be open by
end/February.
S.Ll. Initiative must rest with U.S. and Sec. Genl.
6. Jordan.
S.Ll. Main diffy., in negotns.,, is staging and over-flying rights. They are
reluctant to have it said at this time. But it’s prob. more in their
interest than ours and if so we shd. have no diffy. in getting a secret
agreement.
P.M. Enough to have a secret agreemt. by exchange of letters. Not essential to
have public announcement.
D.S. Content, so long as it is binding. Tho’ we cd. not keep it secret for long,
x| as we shd. be asked about it. Shd. have to disclose it when
Agreemt. itself (as opposed to Heads) is made public.
P.M. Let M/D., M/T. and F.O. consider how this cd. be ensured as effective.
Method. And how cover x/. Prs. enough to tell Iraq.
Result to be reported to P.M.
47
7. Northern Ireland.
H. Now Genl. Election is procdg., no approach shd. be made to Dublin
Govt.
Agreed.
8. Parliament.
RAB. Business for next week. [Exit S.Ll.
9. Oxford Roads.
L.P. Beveridge motion goes beyond Meadow and raises genl. ques. of Oxford
amenities etc.,
To preserve future of Oxford is not too large a ques for a R. Commn.
The more Peers attend, the greater the majority v. Govt. I am
therefore reluctant to put Whips on.
Wd. be unwise to oppose this too strongly.
The Cab.’s earlier discn. didn’t cover whole subject. E.g. outer-ring
roads, shopping centres in Cowley. Moreover, these 2 proposals
were original plan of City Council – abandoned at instance of M/H
and L.G. Road Research Lab. never consulted : v. damaging if that
were disclosed in debate. Experts : Abercrombie takes opposite
view to Sharp.
What is posn. now? D.S. took line tht. Govt. were finally committed to
Meadow road. But H.B. in his memo. takes difft. view – para. 6-7
suggests that position is still open.
If we cd. say that in H/L. debate, wd. be easier. But, even so, if City
Council come out in favour of Meadow road, are Govt.
committed?
This concerns – not merely 2 Dpts. and City Council – but a v. wide
public.
Appreciate last sentence of memo. But H/L. will want to know what
advice and whose will be sought.
D.S. As to past : i) Outer ring and Cowley shops were not dropped at my
instance. They were mentioned in my lr. as valuable contns.
ii) Extent of commitment. Cab. are only commd. to
rejection of inner ring roads and to invitn. to Council to submit plan
for Meadow road on wh. Public enquiry wd. be held.
H.B. Since Cab.’s discussion : City Council are going to produce a plan. That
will have to go to public enquiry. A R.C. wdn’t give same chance
to parties to confront and X-examine one another. Para. 8. : Suggn.
tht. enquiry mght be held by someone other than official of my
Dpt. and tht. report be published.
48
P.M. Much misconception. All we are committed to is rejection of innerroads
plan.
On procedure, attracted by idea of public enquiry by an independent on
precedent of Gatwick.
H.B. Para. 10. No use having this further enquiry during petrol rationing.
Road research lab. Ready to consult them when Council produces
another plan.
Hail. Support suggn. of Gatwick precedent.
But will enquiry bring out real issue : viz., can it be established yet that
an inner road is required – until outer-ring road and shopping centre
are built.
H.B. No reason why this shd. not be covered in enquiry.
P.M. Offer in debate tht. enquiry will be held by independent person, report
will be published, and scope will not be unduly narrowed.
H.W. Cost of inner road would be £3 M. or over. Not in my p’mme.
