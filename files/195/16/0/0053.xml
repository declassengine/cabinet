C.C. 71 (57) 7th October, 1957

1. Economic Situation.
P.M. Need for agreed Govt. doctrine on limiting supply of money –
[avoiding bringing in] theory that speed of circulation as well as
quantity is relevant.
P.T. We have scrambled thro’ i) by borrowg. to support reserves ii) internal
policies. Will circulate memo. on i) showg. how we must repay.
On ii) we must see it thro’. Must limit expendre. to £1.500 M.
On para. 9 of memo. Agree we mustn’t present as choice betwn. full
emplt. and strong £. On 2nd. part, we are not retarding investment
in sense tht. it won’t go fwd. Same amount of money is to be
invested each year, in public sector (£1.500).
P.M. Wd. wish document to be prepd. as basis for speeches.
P.T., H. and I.McL. with R.M. to prepare it (? with Ch. Hill).
P.T. Because we have to accept wage increase for rlwaymen, it doesn’t
follow that cost shd. be carried by increased Govt. subsidy. May
be necessary to find the money by cutting out services etc.,
Shd. we accelerate report from Cohen Cttee.? Stiff report by them mght
stiffen arbitrators.
I.M. Prices : 106.4 : only .1 needed to put it up by 1 point. And rents will
cause it to rise faster in next 12 months than in last. Para. 6 of
memo. is therefore important.
Wages : only a v. small part of area can be influenced by Govt : and
only about 6% by arbitn.
[Enter K.

motion.
P.M. Yes : P.T. to open. No official wind-up on 1st. day. N. Birch to open
and I.M. to reply on 2nd. day. After discussion : leave it open to
decide order – but spkrs to be P.T., N.B. and I.M.
3. Queen’s Speech : Prorogation.
K. No references to R. in Syria, Hungary and Disarmament.
S.Ll. Content.

* Para 17. Insert, before this, a para. on M.Tremblant conclusions.
Approved – subject to points noted above.
4. Re-distribution of Seats.
J.E.S. Virtually agreed with Opposition.
E.H. They haven’t finally accepted para. 5. But mght. be persuaded to
swallow it.
5. Elections : Use of Cars by Voters. [Enter Att. G.
J.E.S. Will not be accepted by Opposn. But law can’t be enforced and shd. be
changed.
Att.G. Support that : only 25 cases brought with success. Usually no
witnesses can be obtained.
Substance approved.
J.E.S. Shd. this legn. be held back until agreed measure on re-distribution is
through? If so, shd. Oppn. be warned that it is coming along.
H. Why have 2 Bills? Can’t it all go into one?
J.E.S. x/ Wd. open door to other amendmts.
H. Not necessarily.
P.M. Do it in one Bill if x/ can be avoided.
If two Bills, not sure we want the second.
E.H. Hope we shall do the 2nd. May be better to do it alone.
6. Betting and Gaming. [Exit Att.G.
Agreed – not to be included in Legve P’mme.
195
7. Queen’s Speech : Opening. [Enter H.B.
Para. 8. Neutral words : to enable the work of Corpn. to be carried on.
Para. 9. re-organisn. will be contd. in acc. with policy laid down in Wh. Paper –
and no reference to Service pay.
Para. 11. add reference to stability of prices and check inflation? Confident tht all
sections of community will co-operate in securing this.
e.g. These measures wh. are to m’tain an essential basis for f. emplt. and
to restrain inflationary pressures will have full support of all
sections of my people.
Para. 13. Cover it by “other measures”. No need for specific mention.
Para. 14. “import duties” vice “the customs tariff”.
Para. 16. Need not be included in speech.
Para. 17. full vice maximum.
[Para. 18. add “and rents” after “tenure” and end at “holdings”. Leave in square
brackets until policy settled.]
Para. 20. Insert in [].
Para. 21. Substitute a general paragraph : adding employmt and omitting
introductory phrase.
G.Ll. Para. 22. Doubtful wtr it is wise to disturb vested interests etc.,
throughout the country. On genl. grants, impressed by Opposn. in
all educational circles. Can’t yet judge wtr this opposn. will be
dispersed by resolute Govt. action. Is this really a part of our
economic policy?
H.B. Settled by Cabinet months ago. D.S. started this 3 yrs’ ago : every
expectn. tht. we shall legislate : smooth passage in 2-day debate
in July. Some legn. is inevitable. Admit tht. under genl. grant
educn. will lose somethg. of its special posn. : but all l. govt.
circles save LEA. favour that. None of consequences of legn. (in
changes of status etc.,) will be felt until after Election.
J.M. In Scotland, outside Edinb., all l.a. opinion is against this change.
P.T. Genl. grant is essential to our economic policy. L.a. exp’re is v. largely
out of control. V. damaging to resile at this point.
K. We shd. only have Bills which are necessary or popular. We
concluded in May that this was necessary.
P.M. Cd. we not proceed with general grant only?
H.B. Structure is known to be inefficient : we now have what is virtually
agreed plan of reform. Commns. of enquiry : conurbations etc.,
are generally welcomed. No small boro’ will be abolished until
their reports are considered.
P.M. Can we not require their reports to Parlt., not to Minister.
196
Ch.H. Each individual case has to come to Parlt.
P.M. This shd. be stressed. ……
