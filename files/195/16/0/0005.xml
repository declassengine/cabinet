C.C. 2 (57) 21st January, 1957

1. Italy. [Enter E.H.
S.Ll. Recent visit. V. friendly atmosphere. Grateful for our attitude and
action re Suez.
2. Germany.
S.Ll. Quadri-partite mtg. of officials to continue fr. where 2nd. Geneva mtg.
left it. In W’ton. Wd. need to be announced. Agreed.
3. Middle East.
a) Jordan.
S.Ll. Note sent on 16/1 to Jordan Govt. on lines appd. by Cabinet.
Since then firm agreemt. tht. Saudi (£5M) Egypt (£5M) and Syria (£2M)
will subsidise Jordan.
Propose to make it known tht. we sent our note of 16/i. Also to send
further note saying tht., in view of Arab action, we think our
negotns. shd begin f.with. May pay us to give some further
instalments while we extricate our (£6M.) equipment. Second
note wd. contemplate termination of Treaty. This wd. leave it
open to us to continue finance for development. Publn. of that
note wd. turn on attitude of J.
b) Iraq.
S.Ll. Crown Prince is here : will ask for 5 Hunter aircraft as a gift to balance
swept-wing fighters held by Israel and Syria.
H. Pakistan is asking for same. Wd. be better to consider on B. Pact basis.
P.M. Are any available? MK-VI. What other claimants?
S.Ll. Believe 15 are available : 5 cd. be gift and 10 on payment.
P.M. Consider at small mtg of Ministers and report to Thursday’s Cabinet.
c) Yemen.
S.Ll. Peace Observn. Mission of U.N. includes Commt. Countries.
Some Sheikhs are not reliable – others suspiciously so.
Balance of considns. seems against puttg. suggn. of observers.
{ Concentrate pro. tem. on getting Yemen to discuss delineation
* { of frontiers.
15
{ Also send statement of our case to U.N. – by lr. to S. Genl. and
statement to Sec. Council.
D.S. Agree – it seems too dangerous to invite observers. Observers wd. not
be objective. And out title is dubious.
Agreed – as at *
d) Egypt.
S.Ll. Treatment of our refugees will cause us trouble in Parlt. Their
misfortunes are due to our pol. action.
R.A.B. Two classes. i) those who have resources in E., and they are being
allowed to draw on them ; and ii) those w’out resources.
Ready to discuss with S.Ll. – if he will send note of complaints – and
to report to P.M.
H.A. Also pensioners e.g. of Egyptian rlways.
S.Ll. 164 of these : who were expectg. award by E. Govt. : have asked them
to formulate list of hard cases.
4. Parliament.
R.A.B. Adhere to p’mme as announced before recess. Homicide Bill will be
awkward (poisoners).
D. Express. Propose (Wed.) that Editor be summoned on Thurs. to be
reprimanded by Speaker – unless he offers suitable apology.
E.H. Similar statements on B.B.C. – and repetition by Labour M.P. Both
may be raised in H/C.
[Enter B.C., Vosper.
5. Economic Situation.
P.T. Danger to £ : one of our greatest risks. Tho’ has bn for 5 years, it is
more dangerous now because we have mobilised reserves.
Budget : £500 M. deficit overall. Choice : swingeing taxation or cuts
in expenditure. Cdn’t face the former: indeed, to enable our
policies to succeed, we shd. decrease taxation.
Long-term plans will help – but no substitute for balanced Budget.
Don’t seek decns. now. But 3 main blocks of exp’re.
i) Defence. £1550 M. Shd. be reduced by £100 – 200 M. Favour
genuine cut of £100 M. on prodn. and research and d. Because of its
burden on industry. Don’t mind compensn. paymts. – for sake of
releasing materials and capacity. Total prodn. cost for defence
equals whole investment in natd. industries.
16
ii) Civil Estimates. Cdn’t do what I want on defence w’out
substantial redn. in social services. Alternatives : 1/= stamp for
N.H.S. but reluctant to play that card now : don’t want niggling
cuts wh. will impair standards : Cut out whole services e.g. dental
for adults (£25 M). Arrive at £50 M. cut.
iii) Public Investment. £632 M in natd. indies. and £500 M by central
Govt. V. difficult to cut latter – schools and hospitals – but
disposed to reduce announced p’mme for G.P.O. (£20-30 M).
On former – we want high investment : don’t know how wise
plans are. Will discuss with M/P. and M/T. wtr we can get a
reduction. Avoid appearance of frontal attack on investment.
But hope for redn. of £30-40 M. by spreading it out.
M. Points of principle. They are supposed to pay their way. If they earn a
surplus, wd. they be free to invest it. I wd. accept that – and
work twds. it.
H.W. Coal – can charge what price they like. Transport can’t. Apart fr. that,
hope we shall adhere to plateau policy.
P.T. Agree : we shd. try. But e.g. electricity : if prices have to be raised,
they shd. go to point at which C.E.A. cd. pay for some of their
investment.
K. Value for money in investment by natd. induies. No machinery for
ensuring it. Don’t we need it? If value of £ depends on their
investment.
H. Are we not underestimating revenue wh. will come fr. heavy
investment over past 3 years?
P.T. We shall gain, in productivity. But doesn’t alter our short-term
problem of Budget.
D.E. There is £600 M. investment in housing. Cd. that not be squeezed in
favour of productive investment? Also shops, offices, etc.,
P.T. Already redn. of £40 M. on housing – public and private.
D.S. On defence : want to frame long-term plan and make short-term cuts
consistent with the plan. See prospect of big economies in longrun
: but diff. to get much in coming year.
L.P. Importance of “prestige” expenditure. Don’t include man-power under
that head.
D.S. Agree qua nuclear weapons. Not “showing the flag”.
* R.A.B. and Ch. Whip to discuss with Ty. procedures for vote on
Account for Defence and report to P.M. what can best be done.
17
H.W. Concessions to middle classes – concessions on surtax and for private
educn. of children.
I.M. Middle class doesn’t start at £2.000. – much below that level. They
will resent economies on educn. or N.H.S. unless we show cuts
on defence. N.H.S. is a middle-class service. Target for social
services : items that are not of 1st. priority shd., year by year, take
a lower percentage of Budget. Under Tory Govts. we have
achieved that, on N.H.S. 1/= stamp for N.H.S. mght. be better –
tho’ open to objns.
B.C. N.I. Fund will go into deficit next year and v. heavily so later on. Shall
soon have to consider raising benefits.
Any increase in stamp shd. go to that, rather than N.H.S. But wd. take
stamp to at least 8/=. Above that, there wd. be repercussions on
wages.
D.V. 70% of increase on my vote is due to increased costs.
But contribn. has remained static for 10 years. Shd. have bn. 20% :
now has fallen to 7%.
P.M. “I said on earlier occasion that I wd. think about this problem over
Xmas and then blow my brains out. Instead, however, I have
become P.M.”
Our longer future holds promise. But we must get thro’ this critical
year.
We must help P.T. in short-term w’out injuring our long-term plans.
Greater part must come on prodn. demands of defence.
Because of foreign opinion, social services must make a contribution.
Invite Cab. to decide :
(i) Enquiry into procedure for Estimates (*overleaf)
(ii) P.T. to discuss investment with M/P. and M/T. and G.P.O. and
social services with Ministers concerned : and investment side
of Civil Defence.
[Exit B.C., D.V.
[Enter Perth.
6. Cyprus.
P.M. Proposed statement to be issued to Press. Thght it wd. be better to give
answer (shorter) to P.Q.
Cd. F.O. and C.O. concert an answer.
J.M. There are P.Q.’s down already.
H.A. Paras 6 and 7 of draft imply tht. he mght help if liberated.
S.Ll. F.O. have a shorter draft which avoids that.
18
P.M. Make it even shorter. Add : this is posn. wh. Makarios has h’to taken :
hope that in interests of World peace he will re-consider it.
F.O. and C.O. to concert reply and submit to P.M.
J.M. Might even be possible to avoid any statement for a time.
7. Coal Production : Africa.
M. Not impressed by report.
P.M. Wd. like M/T. to consider wtr we need say anything on this ques and, if
so, what.
E.H. This wdn’t satisfy opinion in H/C. Hope M/P. will see those
interested.
S.Ll. Tactless in refce. to interests of African countries.
8. Railway Wages.
H.W. B.T.C. have choice of standing on 3% awarded or offering 31/2% all
round. Gesture wd. put him in better position.
I.M. Arbitrators are awardg. on basis of c/living. Wd. sooner settle at 31/2%.
K. But wd. weaken engineering employers.
Agreed : authorise 31/2% as settlement – not offer.
