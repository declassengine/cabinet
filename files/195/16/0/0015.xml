C.C. 13 (57) 22nd February, 1957

1. Duke of Edinburgh : Style and Title. [E.H.
P.M. Recalled earlier discussion. Read new submission.
H.RH. The Prince Philip, D/Edinburgh.
Queen and Prince Philip are both v. gratified.
Formally makes him Royal Prince – in U.K.
Informally, shd. secure warmer title Prince vice Duke.
Will be announced to-day.
[Older] Doms. have bn. informed.
2. National Insurance.
P.M. Cttee. of Ministers to consider future of scheme.
Hope for major legn. in next Session. Practical plan which will
oust Labour schemes. Take initiative.
I.M. Diffies., tho’ formidable, are not insuperable.
3. Israel.
S.Ll. Tel. 427 fr. W’ton. Congress is v. sanctions. E.’s b’cast accepted as
likely to avoid that necessity. They are anxious not to lose kudos
with Arabs.
Canada disturbed. U.S. attitude unsatisf. and dishonest because no
assurance tht. U.N. can deliver goods if I. w’draw. Pearson is
therefore inclined to put fwd. his earlier resoln. – deplorg. I.’s
failure to comply, call on both Govts. to conform, promise of
U.N. forces, invite S. Genl. to consider civil admn. of Gaza, call
on Powers to secure free passage for all thro’ Canal and endg. with
hint of sanctions if I. don’t w’draw in light of all foregoing
assurances. Tail wd. be tolerable for us if body passed by ⅔rds.
majority. * Text in New Yk. Tel. 628.
This wd. be good initiative – wd. forestall Afro-Asian resoln. callg. for
sanctions. We shd. support such a Can. resoln. If a sanctions
resoln. is moved, we shd. abstain. To vote against it wd. alienate
opinion in Arab states wh. is beginning. to move in our favour.
cf. Bagdad Tel. 246.
Draft resoln. : N.Yk Tel. 628.
Bagdad 246. Endorse para. 1. Effect on opinion, lower down, we may
exaggerate – tho’ effect will be serious. Abstentn. wd. be less
serious. Even so, despite risk, don’t believe we cd. support
sanctions resoln.
Right course is to get thro’ Canada somethg. which U.S. mght go along
with. That course wd. be acceptable to Nuri.
59
P.M. Worst posn. U.S. supportg. sanctions resoln. put fwd. by Afro-Asians.
Old Doms. wd. prob. not support. Our best line : abstain, so long
as Can. resoln. can be called and debated.
In U.K. public opinion is indignant at treatment of I, but unaware of
dangers to our oil if Arabs are further alienated. Wd. our opinion
be carried by Can. resoln.?
R.A.B. Are paras. 7 and 8 strong enough? Will Israel be let down over legal
interpretn.?
My view : O.K. on Gaza : para 7 too weak : para. 11 too strong.
S.Ll. I propose a strengthening of para. 7. – to delete legal reference.
Para. 8 won’t be included unless E. acceptance is assured.
D.S. In para. 8 ‘could’ shd. be ‘should’.
S.Ll. Attitude of Israel. Looks as tho’ they rely on U.S. public opinion to
deter President. Their condns. : assurances tht. E. won’t return to
Gaza etc.,
P.M. Para. 4 is not too strong surely. Assumes E. acceptance – “within the
terms of the resolution.”
L.P. Para. 8 is weakest point. Mght be better without this. Rely on right of
passage under para. 7.
P.T. Our real interest is to get I. out, so tht. our oil etc., can begin to move.
If Aqaba is the key, can’t we persuade U.S. to ensure it’s
freedom, by U.S. naval force.
H. Dulles hasn’t contemplated any mil. intervention.
P.M. I suggested to I. Amb. tht. they shd. make direct approach to U.S. for
i) better form of resoln. ii) clearer assurance of U.S. support.
P.T. I. don’t mind delay : for us early settlement is urgent.
P.M. Our dilemma : Br. sentiment hardening in favour of I., regardless of
selfish U.K. interest. But, if Arabs are alienated, our oil may be
further jeopardised.
Shall I send a message?
S.Ll. After Pearson has spoken : not before.
P.M. Read draft message. General support in Cabinet.
L.P. Agree : support Can. resoln. if suitably amended – esp. by deletion of
para. 8. Support that to establish our posn. and then abstain on
sanctions.
60
P.M. N. Yk. 629. Pearson thinks he may get a majority for his resoln.
H. Don’t like I. mentioned alone in para. 11.
I.M. Substitute : “Unless both sides are ready to comply with terms of
resoln.….”
Hail. Or delete ‘unless’ clause altogether. for opinion here is v. hostile to
sanctions. A v. dangerous precedent for us, for only v. a
commercial country like U.K. tht. they wd. ever be effective.
P.M. On straight sanctions resoln. : do we abstain?
If so, we must have supported Can. resoln. in form acceptable to us or
have tabled one of our own.
K. Better to take Can. resoln. in best form we can get it.
H.B y| Para 11. Better : “unless terms of resoln. are implemented [and I.
w’draws]
L.P. | Omit unless clause in 11., insert ‘and in the light of that report’, and
x| merge 10 and 11. Later. H. Omit []. No names or both.
Hail. Wd. prefer a resoln. of our own in terms we and old Doms. approve.
Must take a firm stand with Arabs. Endless concessions to them
won’t serve our ultimate interests.
S.Ll. We can’t control what comes out at end of debate in U.N. I agree with
amendmts. suggested here, but can’t guarantee tht. any can be
secured.
L.P. Go along with Canada. We shall thereby secure more support. But
have a minimum below which we can’t go – on 7. 8 and 11. – and if
that isn’t secured table one of our own.
P.M. If we cd. carry such a resoln., it wd. be 1st. break in Afro-Asian front and
a victory for U.K./Canada. Don’t jeopardise that for a phrase or
two. But, if it gets much worse in amendmt., w’draw our support
and state our own posn. in a resoln. tabled for the record. Then
abstain on all.
P.T. Supported x/.
P.M. If we get posn. in wh. we have voted for Can. resoln. and it fails to get
⅔rds. majority, we mght be able to vote v. sanctions resoln.
Better, however, to abstain on grd. we have made our posn. clear
on Can. resoln.
Further argument in favour of voting r. sanctions (Hail)
61
L.P. Can’t take a decision on this in vacuo – w’out knowg. views of other
countries and atmosph. in N. Yk.
P.T. } Our ntl interest is to get I. out because until they go our oil won’t begin
H.W. } to move.
P.M. Our immedte. effort shd. be to get C. resoln. in a form we can support.
Best form of 11 = H.B. at y/ unaltered.
4. Cyprus.
S.Ll. Can. wants to suggest ventiln. in N.A.T.O. – to avoid worse. We have
feared T. or G. might then leave. But Ismay is going to attempt
conciliation under new procedure.
Propose therefore tht. we don’t oppose this – in formula wh. doesn’t
finally commit us. T. no longer violently opposed to this.
5. Europe.
S.Ll. W.E.U. Ministers mtg. Tues. Redn. of forces in G. Must present this
as realism not recoil.
Wd. like to mention rationalisn. of Assemblies.
x| Wd. like to offer to consider co-opn. in r. and d. and production.
D.S. Gt. practical diffies. over x/. Also let U.S. and Austr. know that it won’t
affect existg. agreemts.
P.M. S.Ll. must have some sugar for our diff. pill.
No trouble over political proposals re Assemblies etc.,
On mil. co-opn. (research and prodn.). There is U.S. observer : and we
shd. also tell Caccia what we propose to offer. We must,
however, reserve nuclear entirely until we have discussed with
U.S. in B'muda.
D.S. Practical approach is to start on easier projects. This is what I have
already suggd. to French.
S.Ll. Friction betwn. NATO and W.E.U. Will float idea tht. we wd. be ready
to agree to WEU being in Paris with identity of repves.
6. Yemen.
D.S. Posn. has become more serious in last 24 hrs. Fort has bn. demolished
by artillery fire and our troops w’drawn. Our artillery is now
deployed : but in wrong area to reply to this attack. C.O.S. now
seek leave to attack these guns by aircraft.
62
S.Ll. Agree – in this situation. But we must have evidence to support action
taken. This is political as well as mil. exercise.
F.O. and M/D to concert, with C.O.
7. East-West Trade.
63
