C.C. 30(57). 8th April, 1957.

Suez Canal. [E.H., F.H. Millar and Beeley]
P.M. French favour refce. to S. Council – wd. go themselves if U.S. won’t.
Two courses i) U.S. negotns. with E. ii) appeal to S. Council. Each
has disadvantages.
i) may produce settlement less than 75% satisf. to us. Wd.
also normalise U.S. relns. with E : not clear what econ.
changes wd. be involved.
ii) wd. have pol. advantages here. Resoln. wd. be vetoed. Mght
be poss. to transfer to Assembly. Danger : offensive opn. in
U.N. mght encourage E. to discriminate v. U.K. and France.
Mght be poss. to combine i) and ii). U.S. reportg. to S. Council state of
his negotns. with Egypt – on lines of para. 4 of draft telegram.
Thus (iii) = attempt to get advantages of both worlds.
A.N. Our diffy : we don’t know precisely what U.S. have got out of E in
negotn. so far.
Addl. idea : U.S. to invite E. to a conference, with t. of r. based on 6
Principles, incldg. main users. If E. refused, this cd. be reported
to S. Council.
H. If agreemt. cd. be reached on consultative board of users and method of
paymt (interim) cd. not that be reported to S. Council – who cd.
endorse and invite further consultns.
H.W. Canal likely to be declared open to-morrow : some drift by shipowners
is likely by end/week. Cdn’t hold them back from use
while A.N.’s plan goes on. I prefer P.M.’s course (iii).
D.S. In the end, if no satisf. settlement, we shd. accept it de facto tho’ not
assenting to it in form.
P.M. I want to slip into de facto passage of our ships while it is covered by a
conference or negotiation.
H.A. If you suggested that S.C. shd. propose a conference, wd. that be vetoed.
P.M. A.N.’s plan cd. be modified – go to S. Council as under (iii) but add
informn. that we are proposing conference.
Suppose we try A.N. plan and E. refuses, it is still harder for us to accept
B. ships paying tolls to E.
P.M. After spkg. to S.Ll. in Paris. We don’t want to risk another rebuff
because hinders de facto passage.
First therefore let U.S. report to S. Council. No offensive opn. v. E. in
S.C. at this stage. Get S.C. to ask U.S. to carry on (no resoln.) –
either as now, negotiation but plus assessors : or Peru mght be
90
put up to suggest a conference. See wtr E. will accept one or
other. As soon as S.C. has this under weigh, we cd. start a de
facto passage of our ships. Avoids any de iure commitment.
Avoid ultimatum to E. – because wd. risk rebuff.
