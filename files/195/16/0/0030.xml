C.C. 39 (57) 10th May, 1957

1. Wages and Prices. [Enter E.H.
I.M. Believe we may get growling acquiescence of T.U.C.
Favour getting into posn. soon when we can have talks at No. 10.
P.M. Various joint bodies. N.P.A.C.I. : N.J.A.C. : now another. What will
it do. Disinclined to get into this before I know where I am
going.
I.M. This will be independent – not havg. repves. of industry on it.
P.M. Fear this will peg down a starting point.
How far is this concern of M/L.? What of E. Planning Bd.?
P.T. Dangers of this body are indicated in report. May sometimes
embarrass Govt. But only constructive proposal so far put fwd :
has backing of Cts of Enquiry : don’t rush into it : but don’t reject
it hastily.
H.A. Support P.T.’s view.
R.A.B. Developmt. wh. shd be pursued. Not sure wtr it shd. be permanent.
Reference to profits – also 4(a) – will alarm Tories. Can we start
it provisionally without time limit (3 or 4 years). It may go
wrong.
M. Doubtful if T.U.’s will accept. Are we to go on with it, if it isn’t.
Don’t like title. Prefer “Econ Stability”.
D.E. Not sure of t.of r.
Full emplt., price stability and coll.-bargaining are what people
want. Unwise to mention 2 but not 3rd. What of b/p. also?
K. Reconciliation of full emplt. and price stability is obvious problem for
our society. No body now to advise on it.
H.W. Favour trying this even if T.U.C. don’t agree.
Are we to secure stability by strike-breaking or suasion? Latter is
prob. safer : and if we opt for it this sort of body is v. useful.
I.M. Also practical method of getting authoritative economic advice to
arbitn. tribunals.
H.B. Favour doing this. But, if we do, we must seem to have confidence in
it. Don’t be tentative.
Does it need precise t. of r. Wiser to launch them with general
direction by P.M. Wd. avoid formal amendmt. of t. of r. later.
115
P.M. i) Will this body help to check wage/price spiral? May be gt.
nuisance and do more harm than good. Can’t operate w’out being
drawn into profits and dividends.
T.U.’s may welcome its views when convenient and reject when not.
Reflects loss of faith in democracy.
ii) T. of reference. Don’t like stability. We want to create more
wealth. Can’t we strike that line? This seems negative approach.
iii) Soundings. Not sure it shd. be done only by M/L. Isn’t it wider
than wages? E.P.Bd. shd. R.M. and Emmerson jointly explore this.
Agreed : Resume discussion early next week.
M’while R.M. and H. Emmerson to discuss procedure.
2. Suez Canal.
P.M. Scua decision. Press re-action re Fr. reservation not unfavourable.
Techn. enquiries via Banks have resulted (so far) in E.
acceptance of plan for dues to be paid in transferable sterling.
This makes it poss. for all members of sterling area to conduct
any transaction with E. via No. 3 Account. Therefore we have
promised to discuss with E. conduct of current commercial
transactions thro’ No.1 Account. We have told our friends we
were making these enquiries : 1) must now tell them results.
2) What advice do we now give to Br. Ship-owners?
3) What do we say to our friends – other maritime Powers?
4) What action do we take re long-term settlement, in U.N.?
S.Ll. E. terms are better than they might have bn. They don’t carry out 6
principles and our rights shd. therefore be preserved. U.N. prestige
is involved and their efforts to seek satisf. final settlement shd. be
continued.
Subject to presentn., believe we shd. now proceed to de facto use of the
Canal. To wait longer mght look more like weakness than
strength and E. might revoke sterling agreemt.
If so : i) do we tell other Scua members we intend to go through?
or do we ask them wtr they will m’tain status quo?
ii) do we seek expn. of view by Br. Ship-owners tht. their
interest wd. suffer by continuing status quo?
iii) as at 1 above.
iv) as at 4 above.
On i), others tend to wait on us. But if we decide, danger they will say
they are following a Br. lead.
On ii) open question.
iii) is a ques of timing
On the main issue, believe delay is dangerous.
K. Favour takg. a line and telling the others.
116
P.T. Financial danger of delay. Cdn’t have hoped for better agreemnt on
sterling.
R.A.B. Ques of presentn. Ships will go thro’. Can’t stop our own. But stress
(iv).
Bring out fact tht., had nothg. happened, Canal wd. have bn. wholly E.
in 1962 (? date).
A.L.B. Cd. Fr., Br. and Norway have made an effective boycott.
Cd. we have run an oil boycott?
S.Ll. Norway regard it as impracticable.
M. Sacony are now going to use Canal.
H.W. Dutch mails, Swedes, Italians and Japs intend to go thro’. We are
already at a commercial disadvantage. The other Conferences
are likely to take same course. True, however, tht. Govts. may
not w’draw advice : some haven’t given any.
Tankers : Caltex as well as Sacony will go thro’. And all the flags of
convenience.
Best course : say honestly it’s against our interests not to use Canal.
D.S. Humiliation : but no advantage in delay.
I.M. Agree. Basle agreemt. is v. valuable.
A.L.B. Wholly agree : bury carcase of policy that’s dead.
D.E. Agree. Trade figures are bad.
H.B. Must accept posn. – not as bad as it mght have bn.
K. No practical alternative.
H. Agree : get it over as soon as poss. Wd. help if others cd. make a
simultaneous statements.
Ch.H. Favour candour and speed.
P.M. Agree. No more to be gained by delay. We have gained by delay so
far – improvemts in E. offer, tho’ we can’t represent it as
satisfactory.
On i) Thank our friends for forbearance, can’t ask them for more, we
shall make statement on Mon., [hope they will do so
simultaneously or before].
S.Ll. Believe may be better to get out to-night facts re use by shipping.
Found our announcemt. on that. Omit [] from tels.
117
P.T. B/E. to tell B/E. tht. they are authorised to bring agreemt. into opn. and
askg. them to open No. 3 A/c. Tel. to go on Saty. Stat. order to
be laid Mon. Sense of agreemt. to be announced in statement on
Mon.
E.H. From Parly. angle statement on Tues. wd. be better than Mon. } Agreed :
} announce
H.W. V. diff. to hold Br. ship-owners over Mon. } on
} Monday.
P.T. For sterling, even one more day’s delay is dangerous. }
D.S. Naval vessels, and troopships. None will be ready to go thro’ until 31/5.
P.M. Will say, if asked, doesn’t arise at present.
P.M. Form of debate. Not adjournment.
3. Petrol Rationing.
P.M. Favour saying : as soon as I am satisfied tht. these arrangemts work, it
will be ended.
P.T. Better to say : M/P. will be makg. statement on that.
P.M. V. well, if asked.
M. Have Ques in H/L. Tues.
Agreed : Petrol rationing is to end.
Announce Tuesday.
[Enter J.H.
4. Egypt: British Evacuees.
Not noted.
5. New Zealand : Trade Talks.
