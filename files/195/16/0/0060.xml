C.C. 78 (57) 6th November, 1957

1. Malta. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Mintoff’s successive demands. May be tht. he doesn’t really want
agreement. Suggest I send him a lr. which puts our position
creditably, if there is a break. Extra £400.000.
R.A.B. Latest constitutional proposals are even more difficult – incldg R.
Title.
2. Pensions.
P.M. Eventually a grand debate. But Cab. unlikely to be unanimous in
favour of August or Sept. plan. Therefore let us have 2 studies –
i) by M/P. into practical diffies. of Sept. ii) by Ty. on Aug. plan,
incldg. possibility of extending graduated contns. into social
security tax.
Then a further memo. and a full Cab. discussion.
3. Egypt.
P.M. Negotiations in Rome. Assume Pickett is not plenipotentiary. He is
only exploring posn. – under a) to d) : e) is excluded.
P.T. Agree.
4. Atomic Energy : Accident at Windscale.
P.M. Prelim. enquiry under Penney. Rpt. to Authority : v. technical :
unsuitable for publn. : also reveals detailed techn. opn. of a
defence plant. Specially inopportune now in light of Anglo-U.S.
discussions on A. Energy ques.
Propose therefore to publish summary – in White Paper on Friday :
with oral statement. W. Paper will be colln. of documents incldg.
report by M.R.C.
Further formal enquiry by Fleck – to reduce risk of repetition of
accidents. His report will be written with view to publication.
5. Wages.
P.M. H/C. was quiet. Neither side want to plunge into this. I wd. prefer to
say no more at this stage. See wtr argument can be avoided.
Try to get people to think there are even more important issues abroad.
But try to get agreed formula – on which we can answer ques.
220
Read draft of this. Ty. and M/L. shd. refine on this.
L.P.S. to concert with P.T. and I.M. this p.m.
6. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for Remainder of D/Address and for next week.
7. Foreign Affairs.
S.Ll. a) Syria. I.P.C. are to spend £15 M. on pipeline extension. This is
wanted by Iraq. It is w’out prejudice to Turkish project.
b) Suez Canal. Awkward situation in U.N. on clearance costs. We want
this resoln. to be passed – least awkward solution – and shd.
support U.S. on it. Easier qua ship-owners to abstain : but if we
do it may be lost.
H.W. If we support this, they may say some of them won’t pay it. They have
expected us to abstain.
S.Ll. We can say (tho’ voting for) tht. we don’t regard it as unsatisfactory.
H.W. Ship-owners may ask us to re-imburse them. Will do my best.
P.M. Balance of advantage tht. scheme shd. be adopted. P.D. mght be able
to arrange tht. U.K./France shd. abstain as protagonists.
8. Armed Forces : Recruitment. [Enter 3 Serv. Ministers
P.T. Complaints re procedure. a) Leak to Times on pay.
b) Independent Cttee. : v. dangerous
procedure. for Ty. Hear that individuals have bn. asked.
D.S. I did keep in touch with Ty. officials : what more can I do? T. of ref.
aren’t yet settled. Emphasis will not be on pay.
P.M. * N.B. to make a report on this. *
Recruiting.
Services’ needs: stated by Service Ministers.
P.T. Are we going to get total? I doubt it : looks as tho’ there will be gap of
40.000 or so. Doubt if more money will close it. May well pay
and not get the men. May be driven to i) N.S. continuing ii)
further cut in commitmts.
221
x| Don’t announce interim pay award. Say it’s being considered. Delay
it until Feb. Shall then know i) how industrial wages are going
ii) what is answer to the 3 def. ques.
Allowances. No announcement until we know precisely what they are.
Must screen those wh. are concealed pay increases.
Cttee. : a v. dangerous expedient. If we have it, we must not give it the
task of saying what is needed to get 375.000 regulars.
Amenities : barracks etc., cd. go forward.
S. Sympathise : this wd. give me £9 M. on pay which I wd. sooner spend
on equipment.
Hail. If role of Service is clear and worth while you will get recruits. You
can’t buy them.
D.S. But you can deter, by unfair rates, those who do desire to join.
Ready to accept x/. : but must, if so, say somethg. on allowances.
J.H. Agree no early announcemt on pay : but allowances are v. urgent, esp.
for Army, to remove injustices.
P.M. Diff. problem – on substance and timing. Glad Services accept P.T.’s
view on latter. Posn. in Army, Navy and R.A.F. Why is it that
Army recruiting is worst when a) it has regimental tradns. b) it’s
role is least in doubt.
Must not abandon now concept of ending N.S.
Must study secretly how we wd. fill gap – e.g. selective service for
sutlers.
Pay : study with view to announcemt. in Estimates. M’while, wd. like
some earlier announcement re barracks : e.g. 5 yr. plan. mainly
affects Army.
Allowances : study them fr. accommodn. view-point, not supplementn.
of pay.
R.A.B. Pay increases and capital investment – both inconsistent with genl.
economic policy – now said to be essential to achieve policy of
abandoning N.S. Quite inconsistent with treatment proposed for
C.D. and for civil investment p’mmes.
H.B. Agree : pressed to cut even sewerage p’mmes. Cdn’t accept public
campaign for barrack accommodn.
R.A.B. How can Cttee. do its job w’out knowledge of future defence plans.
D.E. Surely Service Dpts. know answers w’out a Cttee.
Can’t you get recruits from overseas – incldg. Turkey (!).
P.M. Transforming 700.000 N.S. into 350.000 regulars demands dramatic
treatment. V. different fr. prisons etc.,
222
Hail. C.D. as essential backing to deterrent.
P.T. Can we get out of this Cttee. idea?
P.M. Must have a smaller discussion on genl. issues.
What do we say in Debate? Can we announce i) barracks ii) Cttee.
H. Gt. danger of their saying double the pay. Asking for trouble.
J.H. Not necessary : reln. to civil earnings plus removal of grievances on
barracks and allowances plus prestige and role.
P.M. Accept Cttee. T. of r. to be agreed betwn D.S. and P.T. and submitted to
P.M.
9. Cyprus. [Exit Serv. Ministers
[Enter P. and Att.G.
S.Ll. Dislike this v. much : but no ground in law on which we could oppose
it.
To refuse wd. put us in diffy. in U.N. debate.
Believe it can be played slow – report in N. Year.
P. Support – tho’ with equal reluctance.
K. See no alternative. We have accepted and applied the Convention.
H. Can investigns. be confined to a) and b)?
S.Ll. Yes. Atrocities case hasn’t yet bn. argued before Commn. : and we can
oppose that when it comes along.
P. Must resist any enquiry on atrocities.
Approved.
S.Ll. Ideas for Spaak : for a conference.
Add T. enclave.
10. I.L.O.
Approved.
