C.C. 1 (57) 15th January, 1957

1. The Cabinet. [Enter E.H.
H.M. * First mtg. Message of affection to A.E.
Never was a man so stricken so sadly, but as time passes the
greater will his reputn. be.
Glad so many old colleagues. Depend on solid partnership with
R.A.B. With that can confront H/C.
Welcome P.T. – all qualities needed for Ty. Gt. advantage of youth.
H : cleverest man in country : hope he will teach children (L.P. and
H/L.).
M/T. – confidence in him and importce. of transport at present time.
Hill – will serve us well here and abroad.
* Old colleagues who have left us – Gt. service. Wd. like to thank them
in yr. name.
P. Mills : grateful for sacrifice he has made in joining us.
2. Libya.
S.Ll. Memo. of 9/i was not taken by old Cab. Negotns. with U.S. startg. this
a.m. Line : must cut down substantially : no gt. mil. advantages
save for air. £12M. p.a. in total.
Shd. we suggest actual figure? Don’t want a haggle with U.S. Don’t
want to start by saying nil and settle for e.g. £11/2 M. Wd. sooner
be frank from outset.
H.M. Shdn’t aim at a base, fr. which to operate.
S.Ll. Eg. conspiracy, unmasked, has caused revulsion of feeling fr. E. twds
Tunisia. Pol. advantages in not discarding Libya altogether.
P.T. Split with U.S. – latter taking larger share.
H.M. Avoid impn. tht. because of Suez we are folding up altogether.
H.A. This mght be pattern for new U.S./U.K. co-opn. in M/E.
Hail. Cyrenaica for us : Tripolitania for U.S.
D.E. English teachers wd. help to keep them on our side.
Agreed : F.O. Ty. and M/D. to agree a line.
3. Jordan.
S.Ll. Saud, increasingly anti-E. as well as anti-Comm., is offering to
subsidise J.
12
Don’t wish to seem to be pushed around.
Propose therefore to send note to J., referring to their desire to
terminate Treaty, re-calling past friendship, and offering discns.
with regard to future of Treaty, askg. for date and place.
This will put us in more dignified posture.
P.T. After this commn., we shd. not pay any further instalment of subsidy
after January.
S.Ll. We may secure good-will by terminating subsidy as such. Grant twds
developmt. only wd. cost £2M vice £12M.
4. Europe : Military Co-operation.
S.Ll. Conversn. with Spaak.
On W.E.U. – Fr. are determined to make nuclear weapons. This wd.
make Euratom a mil. organn. as well as civil. Wd. also cause G.
to start manufacture. He therefore intends to suggest to U.S.
somethg v. like my proposal for joint Eur. manuf. of n. weapons.
L.P. Are French in posn. to manufacture?
H.M. May give opportunity for U.S. to propose European mil. co-opn.
Must think. 4 Divns. were W.E.U. commitment – guarantee of Fr. v. G.
We mght be able to replace it by atomic guarantee.
F.O. shd. consider wtr we shd. initiate talks [Exit D.E., P.T.
with U.S. on this general ques.
S.Ll. Spaak is worried : thinks it v. urgent.
5. Yemen.
S.Ll. F.O. Tel. 213 to N. York. Since then Yemen have sent communn. to
U.N. Looks as tho’ they don’t mean to go to Assembly.
Propose now tht. we submit our side of case to U.N. and do no more.
There wd. be risks in observers.
Lloyd. Treaties are v. old and a little shaky – some are mere exchanges of
letters. If U.N. got into it, our posn. in Protectorate mght well be
called in ques. Two or three of Rulers wd. prob. come out v. us.
Mght call in ques. principle of Protectorate Treaties generally.
L.P. Pressure for observers is likely to increase. Cd. we not accept them qua
events, not to delineate frontiers.
S.Ll. Diffy : no delineated frontiers.
D.S. But Yemenis have come far beyond any area in doubt.
13
Ll. We have accepted Y. suggn. of mtg. about frontiers. Will be held v.
soon. Wait until after that.
J.M. On presentn., make it clear tht. Y. have not “taken us” to U.N.
Ll. Frontier is what we agreed with Turkey after 1918, but has never bn.
recognised by Yemen.
H.M. Peace observation party might be accepted : with determination to
oppose extension of U.N. interest to Treaties etc.,
S.Ll. Cd. you continue to use R.A.F. once U.N. observers were there.
L.P. Accept observers if suggd. by others?
H.M. Don’t gain much, in world opinion, by that.
x| Wd. prefer to say we wdn’t object to visit by U.N. observers to report
| on character of problem. Subject to views of Dixon and Govr.
Agreed as at x/. [Exit Lloyd.
6. Persian Gulf.
S.Ll. I.P.Co. are arranging visit of Parliamentarians to P. Gulf.
Not v. wise. They may be stoned.
E.H. Will balance excessive visits of M.P.’s to Israel.
