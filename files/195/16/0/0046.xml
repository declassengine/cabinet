C.C. 57(57). 25th July, 1957.

1. Nuclear Tests. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Recent tests successful. But need for more because importance of
evolving methods using less material. Esp. important because
risk of cut-off of production under a disarmt. agreement.
Less need for long notice. Propose therefore extension of last tests – to
be carried out as soon as possible. Will become known because
of movements of troops. May therefore have to make some
announcemt. e.g. that we shall hold our prepns. in readiness for
continuance of tests.
Spoken to L.P.S., who agrees.
Will inform Menzies – Friday. Then inform Holland. U.S. to be
informed thro’ mil. channel.
Approved.
2. Parliament.
E.H. Business for next week.
Summer recess – dates to be announced to-day.
Debate on L. Govt. H.B. to open: Boyle to reply : Bevins to wind up
on 2nd. day. R.A.B. may have to wind up.
H.B. Much pressure v. block grant from l.e.a. circles.
J.M. In Scotland l. govt. circles as a whole are critical.
3. United Nations : Repn. of China.
S.Ll. We must now decide to support moratorium. Need to support U.S.
May come up this week.
Agreed.
4. St. James’s Theatre.
H.B. Debate in H/L. – we intend to m’tain our tough line.
Old theatre : not capable of enlargemt. on site : not recommended for
preservation as historic bldg. L.C.C. decided, w’out reference to
Govt, to give permission for change of use to offices. Raised
value of site by about £100.000. Littler sold theatre to Fenston.
If I revoked planning permission, cost wd. be (compensation) £50.000
to Ldn. and £50.000 to Ty. Problem wd. remain of finding
170
someone to buy it and run it economically as theatre – most
unlikely to happen.
D.S. Support. When I approved Co. of Ldn. plan I inserted provn. tht. no
change of user for theatres cd. happen w’out its coming fwd. for
decision as such.
But there is a flaw in the law : if permission given there is no appeal to
Minister – who can’t then act w’out compensatg. Law shd. be
altered to provide tht. in such cases compensn. be limited to
expenses already incurred.
[Exit D.S.
5. Colonial Immigrants. [Enter Carr.
K. Recommend no action at present. When taken shd. not be by immigrn.
quota but by proposed Bill.
Total net immigration fr. W. Indies has dropped in ’57. Worst feature :
transformn. of areas into black colonies. Bound to increase. This
shd. be noted. But, despite that, recommend no action.
A.L.B. Decline in trend is continuing. Discouraging reports from those here.
[Exit S.Ll.
H.B. In areas affected, public opinion is ready for restriction. However, I
accept this report.
R.C. M/L. are content qua employmt.
Agreed : no action at present.
statistical report by Christmas.
6. Development Areas.
D.E. Have found a means of doing this w’out legn. – as in memo. If we fail
to act now, it won’t be done in this Parlt.
H.B. Favour this as giving chance to schedule N.W. Wales. This is ideal
opportunity to correct anomalous position: favouring areas wh.
no longer need help and w’holding it from some which do.
X/Project of State organisation to hold trading estates needs
further thought.
J.M. Support x/ : need for interdepl. examinn.
Cannot accept de-scheduling of N. Ayrshire.
P.M. Views of R.A.B. No practical advantage to be gained – and much
opposn. will be aroused.
171
J.C. If it is to be done, we shd. act now – for seasonal unemplt. will begin
to rise.
P.M. Are we really ready to do this : plan changed : not in posn. to answer
any ques about it. We are not in strong Parly. posn. to meet
criticisms. We gain nothing by this. Many other anomalies – but
we can’t cure them all. C. and A.G. may well criticise propriety of
this scheme.
P.T. Welsh position is the difficulty. [Re-enter D.S.
| Assume steel plant is put in Monmouth, it wd. be nonsense to go
x| on treating S.W. Wales as developmt. area and N.W. Wales not.
Why not take the step then and limit it to Wales.
D.E. Can’t add N.W. Wales until I can subtract somethg. else.
Agreed : postpone, in hope of acting on lines of x/.
[Exit J.C.
7. New Towns.
H.B. Legn. – not this coming session but in 58/59. Can’t frame it w’out
consultns. Policy will become known. Wiser therefore to admit it.
P.T. Support policy. We have put £350 M. into these towns.
P.M. Agree l.a.’s shdn’t inherit this property. But argument will be : shd. it
be sold off or held as by Crown Lands.
H.B. Aim : diversity of ownership : but an agency to manage m’while.
D.S. We shd. aim at making them normal towns. Specially important tht.
rents shd. not all be paid to a l.a.
H.B. Want an expert Cttee. to work out system.
P.M. Better to have Cttee., under control of Dpt.,
8. Channel Tunnel.
Note not taken.
9. Hong-Kong. Cotton.
Note not taken.
