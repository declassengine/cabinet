C.M.11 (46). 4th February 1946. 1. Civil Aviation. Deferred until later.

2. Greece. E.B. Won’t suggest it until Sec. Council have “cleared” G.B.

E.Sh. More welcome to adhere to plan of w’drawg. immed. after elections.

E.B. This is part of R. Med. policy. In CFM Depies R. trying hard for Tripoli and Eritrea possibly on Ital. Treaty. While anxious for Reg. Def. systems, attempt by similar pressure of R = decsn. of dipl. war v. B. interests. Threat to U.K. standards of life and naval security if we lose Med posn. Greece = now seen as part of attempt to get a ring round M/E. U.S. attitude not helpful. Leave me alone. Other members of S. Council are intimidated or feeble. Concluded tht. I must counter-attack. V. likely to move resoln. callg. on us to w’draw our troops. I will resist - don’t think it will be carried. But have bn. considg. wthr. if that defeated, I shd. vol. (if Greece agree) offer to let a “neutral” go to Greece. Nothg. to hide. Condn. tht. R. prop. ceases. R. mayn’t like that – precedent for Poland, Hungary etc. P.M. Who wd. be a “neutral”? E.B. U.S. or S. American or Norwegian. R.S.C. Wd. be a useful precedent. General view : in favour of E.B.’s plan. 3. Levant States. E.B. Saw Bidault –said we must both come out of Lebanon as well as Syria. He fenced. I said let’s start moving out of Syria : and they’ve begun. Levant States now proposing to put this to U.N.O. because Fr. don’t show signs of moving and clearly don’t want to leave Lebanon. Fr. are our support for request for base in Lebanon. Have refused any secret arrangement v bases.

Dilemma : if I say we’ll go out : neither Fr. nor Levants will like it.

i.e. Lev. won’t want us to go out if French don’t.

Propose therefore to wait : and say if pressed we will accept decisions of U.N.O. Fr. will be afraid to be left there alone.

488

4. Egyptian Treaty. E.B. Article by Reuter – P.M. said no comm.. negotns. with G.B. w’out U.S. Arab says no truth in this – take no notice. B/T. to note. And I will take it up with Reuters. Civil aviation – suggd. this be taken with Comm. Treaty. I’ve said can’t wait for that : go ahead separately. Told E. Amb. so to inform his Govt. Want to get ahead with Comm. Treaty quickly : get that settled. A.B. Early concln. of satisf. Treaties with E. will assist us in resisting R. pressure in M/East. E.B. Need for strong repve. Govt. in E. – so tht. Treaty may have chance of being ratified and lasting. Some hope tht. more repve. Govt. may be brought into being – for this purpose. Suggns. to that effect made to King have bn. well received. A.B. Satisfied our Amb. is best instrument. E.B. Have agreed he shd. go on for a year. He is good : but has so many unpleasant things to do durg. war tht., his influence with Palace is not v. strong. Am considering wthr I can improve posn.5. Level of Germany’s Industry – Reparations. E.B. Have recd. a formula this morning. Shall try to get this out of the way. P.M. Let us have report on that. Cab. decision required.

6. Spain. Constitutional Position. E.B. Have told our Amb. in Lisbon to have nothg. to do with either Don Juan or Robles. But am pressing Franco, thro’ Madrid, for an early move.

E.W. Are

Diffy. no clear indicn. wthr. Spain wants monarchy or Republican system. Seems tht. many wd. like Republic if sure they cd. get it w’out civil war. May now burst fr. w’in. If they go for Republic we needn’t object. If they prefer Monarchy, other considns. and I wd. have to go to Cab. again. our Amb. being neutral? Looks as if we’re backg. Don Juan.

E.B. I am neutral. E.W. Monarchy in Spain has always been tool of re-actionary R.C.’s. 489

E.B. Am puttg. in memo an agreement tht. we wdn’t nominate any but R.C.’s to B. Council in Spain. But warning – can’t do everything at once : must put up with some things we don’t like.

6. Foreign Affairs Debate. H.M. Debate on F. Affairs. Some supporters will be critical of our attitude. Cd. E.B. address the Party before the Debate – reduce public criticism. E.B. Date? Prefer after U.N.O. delegatns have gone.

H.M. Will try to hold it back. [Enter Barnes and Winster] 7. Civil Aviation. P.M. PA explain salient features. W. Related to Loan Debate in Congress. Otherwise wd. be reluctant to accept Agreement – a) against our policy b) puts BOAC at disadvantage c) Agreement is brittle because attempts to conceal inconsistent policies of free competition and orderly development. Not clear tht. Congress will ques the powers. U.S. operators will be free to saturate the lines. Our only remedies ex- post facto talks or denunciation of agreemt. Unsatisf. Re. memo. of H.D. Para 3(a)(i) : all we’ve gained is tht. U.S. agrees to EATA for one year. Thereafter dependent on U.S. getting fresh powers. Para 3(a)ii): that review will be ex-post facto , with no U.K. sanction save renunciation. Agree to x/: but we’ve agreed to escalation to meet it.

Para 3(b), All U.S. have accepted in somethg. v 5th Freed, wh. is valueless if capacity is saturated by U.S. B.O.A.C. fear this Agreement. R.S.C. Result on 5th Fr. traffic? W. U.S. meet us on various points but w’out relatg. it to 3rd Fr. traffic. R.S.C. Thro’ traffic N. York/India via Ldn. Does this empower them to carry Ldn/India traffic. W. Yes .

490

H.D. memo para 3(b). Wd. be easier if we had a good agreement. But if para 3(c) is accepted by Cabinet. P.M. But what chance of better agreement?

And what cd. we do on a cut-throat competn.? W. x/. We cd. limit their landings. A. Para. 14. 50%. R.S.C. But U.S. haven’t accepted. P.M. But how cd. we do x/. while we have no services running? Are we in a practical position to do it? W. No. R.S.C. Failg. this agreemt. with U.S. Govt. we shd. have to make arrangements with separate cos. A.B. But if U.S. can’t get the powers, this is façade anyway. R.S.C. No : for we shd. be bound by it because we have the powers to implement. A.B. Surely we cd. repudiate when we have aircraft on grd. tht. they haven’t implemented. R.S.C. Yet – by denouncing at 12 mos. notice.

H.D. I’m concerned qua. Loan. Much concern tht. this will have gt. effect in

favour of the Loan. Press that considn. The Loan is worth more.

But in fact there isn’t this choice. Our Delegation strongly recommend

acceptance – see y/ on p.3. i.e. on civil aviation grounds because they think

we shan’t get anything better. We can have this or nothg.

Nothg. wd. give us worst of both worlds – discontent in U.S. + unlimited compctn. of Pan American. Stress 3/ in para 3(d) of his own memo. E.B. V. important qua foreign policy. We’re telling all foreign Govts. not to concede 5th Freedom. They are nothing because our services aren’t coming along in practice. Points to urgency of civil aircraft prodn. Can’t hold this much longer – Ambassadors tell me the Govts won’t wait. 491

Admit diff. to defend this Agreement (w’out Loan argumt). On c. av. grounds.

P.M. &amp; Others. That won’t do at all. We can’t agree to that.

W. Ariel 33. Telegram raised it specifically.

We cdn’t carry proposals for internationalisation – tho’ I believe it must come in end. Out of ques. now because R. views, as expd. by Stalin. On 5th Freedom. N. Yk. to India. Capacity must be related to thro’ traffic. R.S.C. Only a pious hope : no machinery to give effect to it. E.B. Nor was there on Confce Bd. for shipping. On the whole I’ve come to conclusion we can’t get a better agreement. Effect on Anglo. Am. relns. How long will B. people be content with 2 flights a week? Does it help to hold situation, even for 2 years? Shd. be able to hold our own if we can get types into air. But we are behind even 8 months behind with Tudor II. Hermes = failure. We’ve really nothing to bargain with. Can’t tie an operational p’mme to a bldg. p’mme unless latter is efficient enough. Conclude : sign this. R.S.C. This is rotten qua c. aviation. And I wd. prefer arrangements with COS. But if this is so important qua loans we must concede it. Diffy in whr it really concedes 5th Freedom and lets U.S. in over next 2 yrs. all over the world. P.M. But it is fact tht. we haven’t the aircraft that makes it impossible to resist. R.S.C. Worst feature is “change of gauge” i.e. they can carry passengers in aircraft other than that in which they were flown in. Discussion suspended. [Enter Hynd.] 8. Allied Control in Austria. E.B. As in memo. J.B.H. Want some latitude in negotiation. P.M. Clearly.

492

Agreed. [ Exit Hynd. E.B. Sargent]

7. (contd.) Civil Aviation. A. a) We shall have to explain to Doms. why we accepted it. Not easy. They will object. It cuts across all our agreements with Doms. b) Ariel 41 asks U.K. Govt. to be committed to persuade Newf. and Canada to conclude satisfy. agreements with U.S. – Agreement to be contingent on that.

We really cdn’t do that. Cdn’t accept it as condn. of the Agreement. We cd. have informal understandg. we wd. do our best to get them to agree. P.L. India have replied – yes and no. P.M. Will be diff. to put across in H/. R.S.C. Bad enough to defend Chicago agreement. This is much worse. P.M. And if you stress the power to denounce, it will destroy effect qua Loan. A.B. Can’t accept the U.K. as advance base for U.S. air services in Europe. H.D. Cd. this now be examd. by small Cttee of Ministers? P.M. C.A. Cttee. H.D. Plus myself. A. Wd. prefer an ad hoc Cttee. E.Sh. What will you refer to Cttee. P.M. Which agreement. C.A. Cttee can handle this if – Omit Admy. Add C/Exchequer.

Short summary of points at issue. Instruct Delegation to hold on and wait. - ? by askg. for clarification on “change of gauge” (R.S.C.) 493
