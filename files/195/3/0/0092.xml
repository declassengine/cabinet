C.M.9 (46). 28th January 1946

1. Rumania. E.B. Discd. Moscow – Commn. to visit. C.K. went: fixed up. But Groza ratting on date of electns after Harriman and V. left. Have sought informn. on this fr. Amb. there. V. saw me Sat: asked wht. we were doing : told him of this disquieting report. He said he hadn’t heard and they were going on as agreed. Agreed with Byrnes on date, about Mon next : and promised to communicate this week. In view of V.’s assurance – propose we go ahead : recognise by exchange of notes simultaneously with U.S. Will tell V. we must first be sure elections in Spring as arranged. 2. Bulgaria. E.B. U.S. raised and asked for new elections. I supported. Plan agreed was that Sov. Govt. shd. handle it.

V. went to B : Opposn. Parties won’t enter Govt because of condns. V. thinks tht. Sov. havg. done their part, we shd. either tell Oppn. Parties to go into Govt. or recognise. Posn. in B. v. confused : can’t make any recommendation today. Have asked Byrne for a/c of stormy talk he had with V. before leavg. Ldn. Also asked our Amb. for up to date appreciation. Sov. authies. angry tht. U.S. sent Etheridge then Parti pris V. said conduct of our Amb. has bn. proper : but U.S. Minister influenced opposn. parties v. joining Govt. I have never approved hard line taken by U.S. in Potsdam Conference. Wd. have preferred to open up Balkans thro’ trade etc. Propose recognise R : get further rpt. on B : may get it cleared in 2/3 wks. time. 3. Persia. V. coming with Chairman at 12.15 to discuss procedure. This has brought out “war of nerves” tactics – and V. may be realising tht. these are not profitable. May get a change of attitude over this. Need for great care.

Must stop this trick of “negotiating” with large nos. of troops in the country and setting up “stooge” Govts. We used to do it – but it’s out of date. V. feels, I think, it was an error to put Greece and Indonesia up.

New P.M. in Persia is a Russian stooge.

R.S.C. Not a bad chap for a Persian.

4. Airfields – Land Policy

A.B. E.B. has secured moral ascendancy at Conference. Hope no w’drawal now of Greece and Indonesia because Persian Govt. willing to negotiate direct with R. E.B. No fear of that. .

C.E. Cttee have discussed in consultn. with all Dpts. concerned. Diffy. of numerous finances etc. Discn. in H/Lds. Thursday. Cttee wish Ld. Chanc. make statement on Govt. policy. H.D. Accepted by Ty. A. Recommn. confined to multiple ownership cases. What is to be our general policy? Concerned because Boreham airfield, owned by Lord Perry. Used 6 mos. and since then derelict. He offered to take it for assembling tractors for export. Negotiations dragging on for a year. C.E. Am to discuss this case with A. this p.m. E.M. Why delay? What have Cttees been doing? I.W. Rpt. covers single – as well as multiple ownership. Cases like this will be considered if policy approved. P.M. x/. Will C.E. report to me on the particular case of Boreham. J. I visited y’day some airfields nr. Chelmsford. clear can’t root up the runways. 473

Ag. Cttee have done some ploughing at Ch. Ongar, but no one knows what

future will be. No doubt this policy is right.

Second requirement in para. 7. Surely can’t be acceptable?

S. Dpts. using many – others agriculture.

A.B. Para. 7. If policy decided, don’t wait for total decn. over whole country. Proceed individually – otherwise receivg. dpts. will be overwhelmed. P.M. Not without due considn. by Ministers. E.Sh. How many men engaged in looking after derelict airfields? S. Many of them have good deal to do – odd jobs of various kinds. H.D. All v. slow. C.E. Am proposing to put the heat on. I.W. Urged speed – for sake of next harvest. A.B. Why not use the telephone vice Cttee. A clearance officer. R.S.C. Cdn’t Lindsell do it? P.M. I will look into the organisation required. E.B. Use runways (with additions) to improve road communications in rural areas. Let Cttee. consider that. I.T. Civil Aviation ready to let these go. [Exeunt Thomas and Marshall]

5. Monthly Digest of Statistics. P.M. Useful tht. Cab. shd. see. Must watch how much informn. we make available [to critics]. H.M. Black out durg. war. Lifting: but criticism eg in Times that you can’t expect public to co-operate in econ. policy w’out knowg. the facts. Dpts. have bn. and will continue to be published. Agree – pol. embarrassment fr. time to time. But that is not a justification for w’holding this sort of informn. (in a democracy). 474

A.B. We have appd. But it will be diff. to marry this with my monthly statement. E.Sh. Omission – oil because of security objns. May have to add later. R.S.C. Supported. E.B. Will it be embarrassing qua supplies to other countries in need. H.D. No : for it carries back to pre-war figures. Size. Shdn’t be much bigger net. Asked wthr. it is all needed monthly. Was told that this was what experts want – also cheaper. Still, don’t think it shd. expand. E.B. Wd. prefer quarterly vice monthly issue. A.B. That wd. help me. H.M. x/. Let me look at this and settle it with P.M. E.B. Will you include nothg. v currency? H.D. Tables 105-108. contain a good deal. G.A.I. Press Conference? P.M. Has bn. arranged. Approved. subject to x/. 6. Wales and Monmouthshire. H.M. Awkward because gr. bulk of Wales Parly. Party have pledged themselves to idea of separate S/S for Wales. But the more it is examined the more it is found impracticable.

Coalition Govt : M.G. Cttee. after consusltg. G. H. George recommended

against.

M.G. Cttee. under this Govt. endorse – after consultg. A.B. and G.H. We think, not only no case pro but wd. actually damage Welsh adminn. Scottish parallel : Scottish case rests on dissimilarities in law etc. which don’t apply in Wales.

475

Considered then – can anything else be done. a) Devolution to Regions – special conn. for Wales. b) Remember Wales appointing on Govt. Cttees. Maybe later we can think of other little things to help. Suggest next PQ. be answered in negative : and give facilities for Debate if needed. J. W. Advisory Cttee. cd. be used as a sop.

H.M. This Reconstn. Adv. Council has come to a standstill. Was going to ask

tentatively wthr. it need continue. Wd. do so if it wd. please Wales.

A.B. Agitation fr. 2 sources. a) Separate identity for mid and N. Wales.

J.W. Good suggn. in Rpt. If U.K. Dpts. wd. put Senior Civil Serv. in Wales and

Scotland who had direct access to the Minister it wd. check growth of

Nationalist movements.

b) Distress in S. Wales. Success of economic reconstn. in S. Wales wd. see the end of this agitation. Good deal of disagreement in W. Parly. Party. W. Bd of Health is a v. reactionary and inefficient body. Remedy : is in our hands. [Another point not heard ….] Consult Scotland re memo. We cd. help. P.M. Clue to this : economic diffies. : and it is the Econ. Dpts. which most of all shd. have a G.B. jurisdiction. E.B. Confirmn. you can never get a simple Welsh Region. My. T.U. experience. P.M. to give reasoned answer on these lines – when asked. [ Exit E.B.] 7. National Day of Remembrance. C.E. Those consulted feel strongly and unanimously in favour of Nov. 11.

All I cd. do was to persuade them to have it on a Sunday – to avoid 2 days. Another factor : U.S. has made Nov. 11. a stat. public holiday. We wanted to keep in step with U.S. and it wdn’t be easy for them to alter their date – cd. need legn.

476

A. May I inform Doms. before submn. to H.M. Agreed. P.M. Meanwhile consult with Leaders of Oppn. 8. Strikes in R.A.F. S. No. of strikes in Transport Command. 12, of which 9 settled. Press have 2 others reported not yet known to me officially. Steps taken. Demob form and addresses by officers.

Ready to go on as now. But might have statement by P.M. in reply to P. Notice Ques today. Visit of S/S for war to M/E. went far to stave off similar trouble in Army. P.M. Wait for Ques on Paper and let Strachey answer. E/Sh. Let Strachey go out? S. a) Nothg. more to say. b) Encourages disobedience. P.M. Wd. be mistake – wd. undermine posn. of Commrs. once trouble has arisen. J.J.L. I advised J. not to go out because airfields so numerous and personnel so scattered. A.B. Para. 3 at end. Meaning? S. They don’t deny that machinery is worked well. But they are dissatisfied with rate of release. H.D. But sanction wd. be to p’pone release groups. E.Sh. This is India. Need for v. special treatment. Repeat my suggn. of sending some Minister out. S. Began in India : but not limited to that. P.M. And sending out Under Secy. won’t help because he can’t alter the policy.

S. Transport Command. D. Worker doesn’t carry the story.

S. Just received signal from Singapore. Read it out at P.M.’s request. Park. also urgent early statement by Govt. – on points specified. H.M. “Organised movement”. Political? 477

We can’t permit outsiders to come betwn. offrs. and men in time of mutiny. Wd. be opposed to visit by Parl. Delegation now in India.

P.M. This needs emphasis. Appeal to their public spirit.

C.E. Delay in release of particular trades eg. accountants is causing real trouble.

S. Wd. help if we cd. anticipate increased release.

9. Coal Bill

J.J.L. Speed up of demobns was secured by air trooping. This means heavy weight on Transport Command. S. Doesn’t apply to all. R.S.C. Shdn’t the draft answer meet the specific complete reported by Park? S. May I read the draft, which is being criticised? Did so. Need for warmth in the statement – which shd. be made on the spot by officer in authority. And don’t use the work “mutiny” in the field. A.B. P.M. must take the responsibility for makg. statement. P.M. Will do it tomorrow (if not prevented by P.Q.’s) on the Paper. Get you A.M.P. to consult F. Williams. A.V.A. Increased releases. Must look at policy as a whole. May cause more friction, as between groups. .

H.M. Opposn. askg. wthr. Coal Bill is going upstairs. It must a) because we must act on our policy for Parly. reform. b) Because anyway we haven’t Parly. times. We shall have to vote them down. E.Sh. Money Resoln. I will move it. Shd. there be a reply? H.M. Cd. move on ? and offer to reply. 10. India : Food Situation. P.L. Telegram from Viceroy. Situation v. serious. Call attentn. to this because we are to have discn. on Food sitn. on Thursday. 478
