C.M. 2(45). 30th May, 1945

at 6.30 p.m. 1. Syria &amp; Lebanon. P.M. Read most recent telegrams – including one from Paget suggesting that he shd. take control of all troops in M/East.

In these circs. I can’t send the telegram already approved inviting

P.M. Say we won’t act w’out them.

attempt to stop Fr. behaving like this, we endanger our whole

de Gaulle courteously to come to London to consult. Don’t see why we shd. take this burden on ourselves: if U.S. won’t join with us in this, with token mil. support or even decln of their support, I wd. sooner order our troops to withdraw. A.E. Our earlier plan doesn’t fit the circs. Propose we address U.S. saying we and they can’t tolerate this situation because l/c to East &amp; we want their support in dealg. with it. A.E. Special B. interest – whole of M/E. may be inflamed. If we don’t posn in M/East. V.C.I.G.S. Difficult job for Paget: likely to have to fire on both sides. O.L Population wd. be in our favour wholly – not like Greece. P.J. 22.000 B. as cpd. with + 7.000 of Troupes Speciales who may be loyal to be Gaulle. 9.000 Fr. in Syria + 1st Divn. (18.000) in Palestine. P.M. Want to be assured of U.S. support. If we order Fr. back to their barracks, we shall enlist support of Arab world. But U.S. attributed worst motives to us in Greece. P.J. Orders to Paget wd. be to assume control under Lyttelton/de Gaulle agreement. i.e. French agreed. But NB. Paget thinks Fr. won’t withdraw to their barracks w’out either a) orders from Paris or b) force. V.C.I.G.S. What reply to Paget? P.M. Send him copy of telegram sent to U.S. &amp; say make all preparations for action. V.C.I.G.S. Read out descriptive draft. P.M. Why not send at once for Massagli: &amp; warn him what we are doing.

P.J. Fr. regular troops draw their rations from us. P.M. Stop them: add to telegram to Paget. For the present suspend at once issue of rations &amp; ammunition. V.C.I.G.S. Paget already refusing to make up what Troupes Speciales are now failing to get [part of rations] from Bazaar. R.I.C. Minute from Sargent brought in. Fr. Amb. had called. Hoped U.S./U.K. wd. now propose mtg. with de Gaulle: as this wd. make it easier to get the fighting stopped.. Sargent said too

late: we were now forced to more urgent action. Mtg. idea

out.

had bn. put one side, while we considered that: but was not ruled [Exeunt Nye &amp; R.I. Campbell. 2. India – Constitutional Problem. P.M. On reflection ashamed of line I took this a.m. – that a step which I believe to be wrong shd. be taken in order to take the ques. out of politics during the Election and win support from Cripps &amp; Attlee. Those are arguments which can be used by those who believe in the step Realised now that Cttee were not unanimous. S., P.J. &amp; R.A.B. were against it. This Govt. shd. be chary of making permanent changes to meet the conveniences of the hour. We cd. tell Wavell that this ques. must stand over until after the election.

L.S.A. Viceroy, all Govrs. &amp; advisers all believe pol. posn in India is growing steadily worse. At end/war that may develop into v. serious posn. Most of them favoured W.’s solution. Cttee are agreed that, if any stop is to be taken, this is the best to take. I agree with that: If accepted wd. not affect fundamental contitl. posn. If rejected, wd. strengthen our standing in world opinion. To turn down – v. serious. How cd. Wavell return. Proposals known to Labour leaders: how cd. I defend postponing until after Election. If we turn this down now: then (a) if this Govt. returned at Election, this is rejected for ever. (b) if Labour returned, we shall get somethg worse. O.L. “Puts us right with World opinion” - don’t think they will think much of it. L.S.A. Before rejecting it, we must give Viceroy opportunity to state his case. O.L. Continuing: they will say it’s a sham.

Cabinet: Thursday 11.30 a.m. with Viceroy. 1. Syria (resumed). P.M. New telegram from Paris. Chauvet pressing U.K. to submit proposals

for ending the situation.

I have now seen Massigli – told him we have given the orders, are seekg. U.S. support. They shd. order their troops to w’draw to barracks &amp; obey Paget’s orders.
