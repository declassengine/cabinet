P.J. In effect, Army – tho’ UNRRA may put up pretence. Borneo Brunei Bay going well – extended to Miri: advancing inland at Badas. Balikpapau: good start but more opposn now. Burma.

J. offensive in s., to assist w’drawal of J. cut off inland. Prisoners of War. Japan. P.J. Stand-still agreement with Japs – as with Germans. For sometimes J. massacre them. Joint Anglo-American declarn requd. First step however to clear with Doms. Can we go ahead? Involves promise not to use recovered prs. for active role in J. war. Cad. We cd. also get on with war criminals. Agreed. Tangier. A.E. Prev. I said we wdn’t have R. in talks. They have now asked: and Fr. &amp; U.S. have both favoured admn. I incline to stall until Terminal bargaining counter. Best method, unless anyone wants to try to keep them out for ever. Agreed. Prisoners of War – Repatn of Italian Prisoners. R.S.H. Ital. repve – Calendini – reptd to have said they wd. be repatd as soon as shipping available. Cad. We had telegraphed – find out what he has said &amp; get correction made. [Exeunt C.O.S.

Supplies to Russia. O.L. Two points: a) tell R. we expect a contn to W. Europe (food &amp; coal) fr. eastern areas. Shan’t get any food: may get coal.

b) UNRRA. Elab. process of puttg. supplies into Poland

P.J. Tell UNRRA also we are expectg. contn from east. – far from havg.

&amp; Czechoslovakia = puttg. them into R. But enough to tell them they shd. regard their contns as supplementary. anything from west. In makg. plans bear that in mind. Ch. What is UNRRA spending its money on? S. Greece anyhow. O.L. Register the fact tht. we aren’t going to put E.Europe into normal at UNRRA expense.

Ch. Cdn’t U. insist on inspectg – to avoid abuse. A.S. Ineffective in practice. A.E. Vienna: problem will arise as on Berlin. Pre-war was fed from the

east, now in R. occupation. What shd. we say at Terminal?

Principles on wh. Control Commns shd. work.

A.E. to telegraph P.M. for Berlin.

Get R. to accept view tht. a) G. &amp; Austria shd. be treated as econom. whole (as for reparations) x/ b) Zones sd. draw from pre-war sources of supply. R.S.H. Potash. Mines are in R. Zone. We have lost that source. Cd. formula at (b) be extended to fertilisers? Agreed: a) Memo. approved. b) Formula at x/: includg. fuel &amp; fertilisers: [Exit Salter, Llewillin, Leathers Enter Beatty. Future of the Assyrians. L.S.A. Lebanon might take them – to add to their Christian community. No place in Colonies where they can be put. Main livelihood = levies: why not Cyrenaica, if we are going to have an air-base there. Requisitioning Italian farms. N. mountainous parts of Baluchistan. Now being considered for

strategic reserve.

Worth enquiring into these 3 possibilities – fine soldiers, fought for us since 1916. C.O. Same problem with Poles &amp; Jews. Ch. Stressed importce of friends in Cyrenaica. P.J. Agreed. R.S.H. Capable of much increased production. P.J. Are you sure? O.L. When I was in Cairo estimated it wd. cost £6/700,000 p.a. to administer. C.O. We have spent 3 years in filling it up with Senussi. P.J. Put them there only as levies for airfield.

Cab. Moyne turned it down – but as adjunct to airfields a new idea. C.O. Cd. you put in many on that basis. A.E. Put to M/East alternatives of Cyrenaica and Lebanon. { also Eritrea. LSA. to consider Baluchistan. [Enter Law. Exit Beatty. Housing: Use of Empty Houses. RAB. Explained M/H. proposal. 1week’s grace to owner. Wd. like to insist on more adequate notice to owners. Agree can’t have much delay – otherwise Vigilantes will beat us to it. R.S.H. Limit of size – by rateable value? RAB. No Make contact with landlord - &amp; obtain his views – then give him a week. Ch. A week or such longer period as may seem reasonable in circs. A.E. Two wks. after contact with landlord. Establish contact: then 10 day’s grace. Don’t announce before 12/7.

RAB to communicate with M/H.

Educational &amp; Cultural Organisation of United Nations. Agreed.

RAB. Forestall Institute of Intellectual Co-opern - important. [Enter Simon. India. L.S.A. W. proposes make own list: see Jinnah &amp; persuade him to accept. Also see Congress because going outside their list. List of 2nd choices in reserve. At present only needs authy to proceed on those lines. Further ques. – for India Cttee. – on what to do if negotns break down. Believe W.’s list is good. May get it accepted with some alterations. P.J. a) I have always wanted to avoid appearance tht. key econ. jobs are in hands of people subservient to industrial interests. On this ground allocns of Matai and Patel are desperate. L.S.A. Diff. to judge that kind of thing from this end. We are commd to principle of Indian self-government.

S. Prior difficulty. Grave doubt – para 2 “in acc. with original plan”.? That was a plan for inviting fr. Parties their list. Point of that was names wd. be of people supported by their Party &amp; ready to take job. But Mosl. League have refused to put in any list. He hasn’t therefore bn. able to make his list from the Panels: because he has failed to get lists from all. P.J. Even more fundamental. M. League will be able to take hostile line v. new Council from the outset. S. Congress may be manoeuvring to show up Moslem League. A.E. a) we wanted to avoid a negotiation. b) choice wd. be from the lists. As Jinnah has not produced list, I thought only ques. now was how to bring thing to an end. L.S.A. Has been no negotiation on scope of offer. Always assumed some give &amp; take in discussion of lists.

Natural thing now – discuss with Jinnah &amp; get him to nominate

people suggested by W. A.E. But is this W.’s proposal? P.J. No. W. intends to publish at once. C.O. If you stop now, he’ll have to show up Jinnah as stumbling block. O.L. Beware of losing repve character. If it’s our list we lose it. Why not authorise him only to hold private conversns with J. – to get him to put fwd. his list on assurance tht. Viceroy will not add an awkward Moslem.

O.S. He is going outside Congress list. Thus , it is his list. And we insisted he shd. have his list. L.S.A. a) See J. and find out wtr. he will play when he knows who other

b) See Congress &amp; ascertain wtr. they accept his addns.

(your not putting in a list) I put it fwd.

Moslem is. R.S.H. But W. intends to put whole list to each side. There wd. be no objn to showg. each side its own part of the full list. L.S.A. Leave details of negotn to man on the spot. P.J. Go for J. alone: here is what I wd. recommend. Will you put fwd. nomination of 4 Moslem Leaguers. And will you play , if Take this action with J separately – to get him up to scratch with

others.

A.E. We agree on handling of J. – as above. Why make simultaneous approach to Congress. S. No approach to Congress before we know result of talk with J. O.L. Whole list shd. not be shown to both sides. [ Agreed. RAB. V. bad Govt. if this does succeed. Wd. like to see honourable failure: followed by his smaller efficiency Govt. Go slow. Deal only with J. C.O. I wd. include in telegram leave to consult Congress, but make it clear it comes at a later stage. Agreed: no objn to that. Agreed: Subject to reportg. back if J. won’t play. If he will, W. to go on to Cong.
