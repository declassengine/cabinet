W.M. 35(45). 22nd March 1945. Poland: Publication of Anglo-Polish Secret Protocol, 1939. A.E. Trouble: whole lot of letters wh. passed in these years wh. wd. be embarrassing to explain if Poles published them. Bellenger Q for y’day: postponed at our request. Think, however, we must publish. General agreement with this view. Want to tell Poles first &amp; ask their permission. Expect they will agree. [Item 1 = War Cab. only. Italy: Claims against Germany. M.A.P. What will Russians say? A.V.A. Will this prompt Russia to make similar claim for Roumania. A.E. Only puts them on the list – long way from getting anything. Reparations and Dismemberment. J.A. Sent caveat to Yalta: recd re-assuring reply from P.M. Now afraid R. taking difft. view. Think we shd. clear our minds. My feeling is maximum reparations/maximum dismemberment are incompatible. Believing fundamentally tht. the 2 policies are exclusive , I fear tht. Russian appln of their doctrine in their Zone may leave us with an area which is not viable. Greatly fear tht. if we don’t soon safeguard our position, matters may so develop tht. we find ourselves alone in W. (U.S. having withdrawn) respons. for an area wh. is a deficit area having to provide imports with no prospect of getting out w’out leaving a chaos wh. wd. be a disgrace. Don’t want to short-circuit F.O. memo to A.P.W. Profitable to have a discn of genl. principles first on this. A.E. Some of these problems will arise with or w’out dismemberment. Russian Zone: if they take machinery they must give food fr. their Zone to ours. Remember (a) R. at Yalta v. keen on dismemberment. U.S. went long way with them. The word is now in the Terms/Surrender. You can get reparations in kind even from 3 countries – R. view.

Diff. to conclude on this – without full discn of A.P.W. memo. Either A.P.W. shd. take both: or special Cab. shd. take both P.M. We put it in only as a matter to be explored. A.E. By my Cttee in London. P.M. Some parts of larger G. wd. bloom if relieved of heavy burdens laid on them by Russia. Also freed of mill-stone of armaments. R. has not bn. thro’ our experience of Reparations – no bitter memories. Also they can absorb a good deal more than we can. Delusion to think our economy will benefit much. U.S. expect nothing except securities in their control. R. on other hand are resolved to take all the machinery they can use. At least tht. wd. remove G. competn &amp; leave the way open to us. Wd. help our export trade. Ditto, later on, with Japan. J.A. Don’t oppose the principle. My trouble (see para. 4): R. will get productive surplus area while our Zone is deficit. A.E. But occupn is separate from issue of separate States. L.P. Look how it will develop. R. will crush the East to peasant level. In the West, we can’t level out the industrial area: it will remain depressed on a high level of civilisation while their Zone is contented at a low level. J.A. Tendency will be for each occupying area to concentrate on own Zone. P.M. Was not intended tht. mil. occupn shd. be linked with reparation – were meant to be handled as separate issues. During mil. occupn there will be a central authy. Dismemberment may prove impracticable. My personal view is “isolate Prussia” because historically they have bn. the cause of all the trouble. Wd. look for one State centred on Vienna – 30 m. or so. And wd. treat these people more easily than those in Prussian Zone. Stalin likes that idea. I wd. like to bring in Hungary too. But U.J. wants to keep that w’in his influence: belt of States friendly to USSR. Attempted to reach no concln at Yalta. L.P. Then what of the rest, Hanover etc., P.M. Under international control.

O.L. Imposs. to discuss this Memo. without also discussg. F.O. Memo to A.P.W. Discrimination makes it impossible to discuss w’out bringing in reparation. Can’t disentangle the two. M/L. Reparations go beyond capital goods? P.M. R. want annual supply on consumable goods too. M/L. That will raise the cry tht. we shall finance G. to make those goods – that leads to war potential in G. &amp; repercussions on our economy. Not worried over the “once for all” it’s the “annual” that is dangerous, as leading to financing G. to enable them to supply. Back to Dawes Plan &amp; loans. Effect on B. standards. O.L. We shd. stick at potash &amp; timber, wh. we can’t supply ourselves: &amp; not run on into man. goods. Ch. All we can get fr. G. = export markets. Don’t let anyone take reparations in man. goods. Otherwise we shall re-build her industry. Their necessary imports are v. small. They produce 2.300 cal. p. head today. Let them live on that: or raise it to 2.500 when troops return. Concentrate on stopping anything necessitating re-buildg. their industry. More diff. for them to run industrial econ. if dismembered: but I don’t care because I don’t want manuf. goods from them. No need to prevent trade betwn. one part of G. &amp; another. H.O. But 80 m. people in G. who must live. If the industry is destroyed can 80 m. live on the ag. wh. is left? P.M. Taking off the mil. load will help a lot. Her standard ought to be lower. H.O. A Germany in econ. dissolution &amp; semi-starvation will eventually command world compassion. Indeed, may hurt B. trade. Let’s concentrate on a) prevent re-armament. b) control war potential. If we go beyond that &amp; seek to smash their economy a) we shall have v. great diffy. as occupying power &amp; b) will harm B. commercial interests. R. sentiment is running away with them. I agree with C/E. Memo. P.M. Agree there will come a time when condn of G. labouring class will excite compassion etc.

A majority view here in 5 years probably. But our problem is the immediate crisis at end/hostilities; &amp; R. attitude then. All we’ve agreed so far is to investigate chance of dividing G. on historical lines. But even the theoretical study of this is likely to take 2 years. That is some long way off. No decision on that at once. Immediate organisation = occupied Zones with a central authy controlling them &amp; seeking unified treatment &amp; policy throughout. That regime can continue for 2 years. F.O. need strong techn. Cttee to study this under the F/ Minister Cttee (i.e. A.E., Winant &amp; the Russian). Then much considn and prob. public discussion. Not wedded to dismemberment: wd. try for it: but may be convinced by the study to be made tht. it is impracticable. Reparations. Be sure R. will take machinery from Ruhr &amp; Saar as well as Silesia. H.O. Rough on us if they strip our Zone. A.E. We must take the line tht. what they take from our Zone in machinery must be balanced by supplies of food from their Zones. M.A.P. Which turns our Zone into a vast soup kitchen. P.M. Put it then tht. R. must not be relieved from responsibility for condns they create by removal of the machinery. M.A.P. Reparations start at once: you can’t wait until solution of dismemberment has bn. found. P.M. Zone –settled. Dismembt : to be studied by Cttee here. Reparations: to be studied at Moscow. We have to choose a delegate. J.A. “Prolonged study.” Isn’t there a great danger tht. future will be largely determined by what happens in early stages. Longer you delay the more unlikely dismemberment will be. A.E. Needn’t be so v. long over it. We’ve got a plan. We cd. put it to W. Cab. B.B. Meanwhile U.S. are acting. They’ve seized G. patents &amp; are negotiating. We shd. do the same. P.M. In Reparations sphere.

P.M. Agree our delegate to Reparations Conf. Moscow must be chosen &amp; instructed. H.O. Put both Reparations &amp; Dismemberment to A.P.W. Cttee &amp; ques. wtr there is a link between them? J.A. If dismembermt. is postponed, agree won’t arise at once. P.M. Wdn’t agree that there is a link between Reparations &amp; Dismemberment. They are both being considered in different places. R. in Moscow D. in London. E.B. Cdn’t A.P.W. put up alternative Rpts on Reparations a) from unified b) from dismembered Germany. Wdn’t be asked to report on Dismemberment. Adjourn discussion until next week. Local Government (Boundary Commission) Bill. Approved.
