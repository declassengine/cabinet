C.M. 63 (45) 17th December 1945

1. British Air Services. W. Earlier draft considered by interested Dpts. &amp; by Socialising Cttee.

Suggest: “ Adv. will be taken of suitable facilities offered by aircraft &amp;

engine industries”. And I will consult with M/Supply.

R.S.C. For opns of aircraft industry, v. important tht. lessons of operns are harmed

by the industry. Repair organs of operatg. organn can’t have same

facilities for research etc. Example: piston rings: put right by use of

dif. materials when it came to R. Royce.

Substitute general assurance tht. M/C.A. will see to it tht. proper

arrangements are made for maintenance &amp; overhaul.

Suggestns from H.M. &amp; C.O. will accept &amp; incorporate. M/Supply at end II “ it is, now desirable tht. major overhauls &amp; repairs be undertaken only by aircraft industry who can thereby be kept closely in touch with pract. opns of their products. Pre-war: manufars. overcharged. Operators found it cheaper to do work selves. Engines, airframes &amp; present practice &amp; overhaul one part after each flight. H.M. M/S. is on a real point. Need to keep industry alive &amp; bring them up against faults etc., Better to say “ normally thro’ the trade’: loophole if industry doesn’t play the game. W. Manfis. appt. liaison offrs. with operatg. cos. R.S.C. That doesn’t do it. Detailed examn of thousands of piston rings by R.R. produced the results. P.M. Why put detail in W. Paper – unless mandatory its unnecessary. R.S.C. Nec. only because of what is in para. II. Omit whole para. if you like. A. It is there because of safety considn – maintenance &amp; overhaul is key to safety. P.M. Ques. – as on para. 12 – is what will Minry do to see to it? “expected” is v. weak. Operations will be required – in accordance with a scheme to be concerted by M/C.A. &amp; M/ Supply. “Required” also in para. 12.

E.Sh. Para. 6 (iii) – may be prejudicial to coal. When we say it is desirable. Does (iii) add anything to (i), (ii) and (iv)? P.M. (iii) is a bad reason: the other 3 are good example.

407

H.M. W. is anticipating a strong argument con. New industry shdnt’t be entrusted to a single public monopoly. We are therefore havg. 3. P.M. But (iii) is only negative: (i) &amp; (ii) have it implicitly. W. Put in (iii) because B.O.A.C. intriguing for sole control. P.M. You cd. add “managerial groups” to (iii). Giving the opportunity …. in (ii). Agreed.

W. On what grounds? He wouldn’t go quietly. He was vindicated by

Coalition Govt.

A.V.A. First consider whtr you have another choice who can do the job as well.

W. B.O.A.C. has operated successfully, safely &amp; at a profit – under his

control.

Individual Appointments P.M. Shd. not be discussed in Cabinet. But get rid of Critchley. R.S.C. Ask for resignation of whole Bd. Then your hands are free. T.W. Determine the ques. on basis of his efficiency. Para. 23 S Looks like a trading arrangement. – last sentence. Alternative words suggested &amp; accepted. Agreed. b) airfields vice aerodromes }Agreed

H.D. a) Para 17 (b) – as shown in mns. } c) Prestwick. Para. 12. As in ms. To avoid grudging } impression. } E.Sh. Para 17 (b)? necessary to refer at all to subsidy. H.D. No need to humbug – there will have to be some. E.Sh. Why assume you will have to?

H.D. It will be necessary – at any rate on other 2 Corpns A. Why have // in 16(b)? “More detailed”

408

Agreed. White Paper to be presented this week. Announce by L.P. Wed. in reply to P.Q. Both Houses.

Interim Arrangements. W. Para. 15 (c) Hartley is willing. A. This doesn’t include Pacific. Recent diffy. in getting P.M. of N.Z. across

Pacific. Unless we can start there U.S. will get in. Aust. &amp; N.Z. want

some

P.M. Don’t discuss apptmts in Cab. Discuss with P.M. and L.P. (Socialising grp.) S. 110 Wing: we are v. anxious to hand over. W. Easier to abort now we can buy the Dakotas.

service started to give excuse for keeping U.S. out.

2. Broadcasting Policy.

W. Working on this with B.O.A.C. now. Extemporise with Lancastrians &amp; flying-boats. A. Some public statement shd. be made soon. H.M. Cab. shd. approve proposal to enlarge B.O.A.C. Bd. temporarily with people to look after other services. Then move them off on to Bds. of the new Corpns. {Exeunt: Barnes, Wilmot, Winster {Enter. Listowel. Williams, N.B. H.M. Based on review of work of W.’s Cttee under Coalition Govt.

a)

b) No need for public enquiry àla Ullswater. Govt. decide &amp;

announce. May hve to be debate.

Ministerial responsibility. Better not discuss to-day - cound with future of imformn services. Refer this ques. to Cttee workg. that out. c) We recommend continuance of B.B.C. monopoly. d) Remuneration of Chairman, May be excessive. Depends on balance between Chairman &amp; D.G. P.M. Do you want part-time Directors – or full-time functional Directors. H.M. e) Part-time members. Functions v. light. Supposed to listen &amp; discuss p’gmmes. Not takg. enough interest in estab. &amp; finances. But think it wd. be bad to have full-time functional Bd. What is needed

409

is outside watching by independents. If so, £1.000 p.a. is too much. £500 or at outside £750. The real basis is “fee”. f) European Services. Done good work (P.W.D.) in war. F.O. believe shd. be contd. R. &amp; U.S. are doing much. We concluded must continue. They are expensive &amp; can’t be charged to home listeners. Means we can’t have as many Reg. wave-lengths at home. But there can’t be at same level as National. B.B.C. accept our recommns on this pt. Reith wd. reduce them still further. g) B.B.C. outspendg. its budget. Used to bring in money: now Ty. is subsidising. Not all on foreign. Of £14m, home costs £71/4M and income only about £5M. Pity the licence fee wasn’t raised durg. war. But agree tht. deficit shdn’t continue to be carried by Ty. &amp; support immediate increase of licence fee to £1. Action (i) No need for public statement until we decide on min.-responsibility. (a) above. (ii) Announce increase in licence fee. (iii) Tell B.B.C. Govt. agree to plan for European Services. P.M. I was member of Ullswater Cttee &amp; Coalition Govt. Cttee. a) Don’t agree suggtn Reg. b’castg. unimportant. They can do a good deal – h’to given little money. Reith is by nature a centraliser. This is only answer to criticism of B.B.C. monopoly. Want variety &amp; controversy. b) Support increase in fee. R.S.C. Payment by instalments – for O.A.P. etc. P.M. Consider that. c) Overseas. Tie up with Inf. Services. d) Governors. Has bn. v. ineffective. Old people – not sufficiently Labour in view. Fees: may have to pay more to get energy &amp; youth. Want a Bd. tht. won’t let it tick over under D.G. V. dangerous. You do want political people. R.S.C. Shdn’t D.G. be on the Board. Like a Managing Director. H.M. Sooner not. I want the Bd. to do a job. But must decide whr a Bd. of executives or watchers &amp; criticisers and if it’s latter I can’t see £1000 p.a. in it. Are M.P.’s to be barred? Used to be: but W.S.C. broke into it.

H.D. £3M. uncover in 1935 &amp; they paid their way. Drifted into sponging on Ty. B.B.C. must be put back on budget balancing basis, or home services Fee therefore shd. go up to £1 at once. On instalments, no need to go below 2 payments of 10/-.

410

L.

E.Sh. Don’t let’s take rigid Ty view on this.

Agree to it earlier for C. aviation. Then it’s not such a bad balance sheet.

First thing Lab. Govt. does is to raise the fee. Hard on O.A.P. &amp; poor

people.

E.W. e) Para. 17 “W’in next year or two”. Durg. that time no. appliances

will be coming on to market. Need therefore to get this requirement.

soon.

Wd. like to examine admin. diffies of instalments. Over seas – £31/4M. – proposed to put on F. O. Vol. Then £1M on income tax – take note of that. Television £2M – must be prepd to subsidise experiments. &apos;B’castg. isn’t commercial. Cultural to some extent. State, if admits responsibility for providg. it, must be prepd to pay for it. P.M. Its 31/2d. a week – compare that with cinema charges. E.Sh. But it’s cultural - &amp; ;you can’t be logical about it. Opera etc., as subsidised abroad. What does it matter if Ty. pays £1 or 11/2M. for this cultural service. E.W. a) M/Ed. shd. be included on any Cttee on this ques. qua culture. b) Disagree with E.Sh. Socialised services must pay their way. c) Reg. Programmes. At present largely relay Nat. p’mmes. Better to have fewer and better. Tho’ agree with boosting Reg. system &amp; strengthening it. d) Wavelengths. Interf. with ships at sea. Trouble often arises fr. age of apparatus in ships. And G.P.O. won’t chase the ships. N.B. supported this. J.J.L. Regional devolution. Worse than “Londonising” – its “Oxfordising” a professional. No life in national. Para. 4. How do we complain of misuse. of offl. informn? P.M. To B.B.C. T.W. Don’t support further reduction of Regions. P.M. Hope W. Country isn’t going to become B’ham. P.L. Factual accuracy of B.B.C. news – wh. is regarded abroad as “Govt.” news. Examples of inaccuracy. Want it tightened up. Don’t know how. P.M. Deal with that on Informn Services &amp; Foreign Services. 411

A.S.C. A public statement tht. powers will be taken will ensure tht. manufrs. will add it to new design. Agreed: P.M.G. &amp; M/S. to consider.

European Service. H.M. Need for early Decision that then shd be one. A.V.A. Ships at sea – high-power transmission is dangerous to life at sea: and will

take years to get the apparatus improved. A break of 3 mins. for

each 1/2hr. wd. be valuable.

N.B. After liberation gt. drop in listening – but thereafter it picked up again. People have come to regard B.B.C. as true news. Has gt. authy. Instrument for brkg. a censorship. Urgent because best staff are slipping away, esp. the best of them. Agreed: An European Service is to be maintained. Fee J. Is cost of television included? H.M. Yes: but there is a special licence fee. P.M. Even so, it won’t cover all the cost. £2M. cost and £.05M Fees. R.S.C. The £2M is mainly capital expenditure. H.D. A fee of £1 is needed to meet expend’re. w’out television. C.E. Shd. we not examine £7.20M. for home b’castg. Some of the fees are v. excessive. Wd. like to feel this had bn scrutinised. Can’t support £1 fee until satisfied on that. E.Sh. Secret payments to B.B.C. favourites. P.L. What right have we to charge house listener for services not provided to him? Fee of £1 wd. yield £10M – far in excess of real house b’castg. cost. A. Support £1. This service is egregiously cheap. Fee shd. cover not only current cost but large margins for experiment &amp; developments. Investigate the £7.2M if you like.

A.B. Support £1. Tho’ our informn seems to be inadequate. Provided there is sust. increase in exp’ve on Regional p’mmes. These p’mmes will replenish the “gathering grounds”. The more centralised &amp; general,

412

the less colourful &amp; alive. Particular &amp; local v. general &amp; abstract. Metropolitan weight on B.B.C. is excessive. P.L. 15/- would cover the cost. H.M. Pity it wasn’t raised durg. the war.

Soften the blow by 15/- in 1946. P.M. Wd. only prolong the controversy. E.Sh. Raise it as fr. beginning of 1947? M/Inf £1 will = £10M. £91/2M. estimate for next year. Will have to be said tht. fee is to cover sound &amp; television at home. 15/- won’t cover it. And you must have some margin. Agreed: Increase £1. But scrutinise expenditure. R.S.C. a) paras. 13-14. Hope B.B.C. salaries won’t reduce to C.S. levels. H.M. No

R.S.C. b) Re-diffusion.. Will grow: thus, don’t delay takg. over. P.M.G. to report

P.M. * Other ques. in memo. to be discussed later. [Exit Listowel. P.M.]

3. B.U.F. Re-emergence of the Fascist Movement. C.E. D.R. lapsed. My powers now limited to action designed or likely to create breaches of peace.

P.M. Must keep close watch. Risk of anti-semitism. C.E. Even that is not per se illegal. T.W. Body of people advocatg. Fascism. Is that legal? Why fight for 6 years to put this down &amp; then allow it to be advocated? C.E. Not against the law.

E.Sh. Are we not being too Liberal? Suppose mtg. held in secret &amp; there

advocated changes subversion of public policy.

Shdn’t Police have access to such mtgs.? Risk of organised movemt. developing before we know it. Presence of R.A.F. personnel in support of Mosley shd. be closely watched. L.O.O shd. examine the posn. 413

A.B. Was it true tht. photographer was beaten up outside the Hall. If so. what were the Police doing? [Exit P.L.] N.B. Many countries re-establishing democracy where F. parties much stronger. What we do here may be model for them. J.J.L. Hope Cab. will have special opportunity to examine report on this. H.M. Ask P.M. to set up small Cttee to look into this ques. – with Jowitt in Chair &amp; Home Secy. a member. 3. Indonesia.

Will be said – Lidice over again.

N.B. In statement. last week I defended burning of a village. Now S.A.C.S.E.A.’s policy to have like reprisals for like offences. Major: a girl – swimming in village water supply. Rpt. of a 3rd village being burned. Suggest. – either full statement in justification or modify policy. H.M. Policy shd. be considered by Defence Cttee.

Agreed. R.S.C. Hope this policy won’t be continued. N.B. But what is McNeil to say this pers in reply to supplementaries? H.M. Put his diffices – our people suffering etc. Ask for notice of the new case. J.J.L. N.B’s statement other night cd. be advertised. 414
