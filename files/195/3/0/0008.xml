W.M. 33(45). 19th March, 1945. (6.p.m.) Poland. P.M. US – UK. now in agreement. U.J. : D.K. : U.K. Hope all will be well. Peace-Seekers – Italian Front. O.S. Telegram fr. Alexander: all is off as Kesselring moved to W. Front. P.M. Then no need for a row with Russians. But agreement for future: any approach with pol. aspect the C. in C. will negotiate but all 3 Powers will be allowed to be there because of political possibilities. Anglo-French Financial Agreement. J.A. Unusual features (2) designed to get gold from France. Described as in memo. This £60 m in gold will be v. useful. Fr. French angle, largely face- saving. Pleven in Dec. last made it clear tht. they cdn’t put any agreemt. across re gold unless coupled with supplies. That is why the agreement takes this form. P.M. What strings to this? Pegging franc to unnatural value. J.A. Mutual consultn before exchange value is altered. Don’t want to suggest we are responsible for the 200 value. 360 – 800/900 on Black Market. On wage-ratio 200 not far out. But no one can say to what it will settle. P.M. Have we forgiven much to get this? J.A. Only makg. mutual-aid retrospective: under the agreemt. made with them when they were in N. Africa – because we began helping them there on cash basis. A.V.A. Para. 2 last words. “original cost less depreciation”. Fr. will get various ships of war wh. they have used since new. J.A. Only residual value comes in here. War use comes under Mutual Aid. B.B. It puts on record the opportunity given to foreign Govt. to enquire into bank balances of private persons here.

B. Not tough enough. Permits paymt. 1/3rd gold &amp; 2/3rds. blocked balances. This involves takg. blocked balances to pay for current supplies. The £158 m. was paid to prevent Petain getting goods in U.S.A. – not to get the goods. Monstrous that we shd. have to deal with it now on basis of refunding to French. Depreciation. Shd. take a/c of depreciation on equipment taken over from U.S. Consultn on exchange rate is equivalent to fixing the rate. Ch. Wd. have liked to get more. P.M. &amp; J.A. Not so easy out of the French! Ch. Hope cancelln of claims doesn’t cover delivery of supplies. J.A. It doesn’t. P.M. Record: no big debt post-war. J.A., Disclosure of balances. Banks at first protested – grd. of breach of principle of confidence betw. banker &amp; client. We are not in fact handg. over to Fr. any informn from banks about clients. The assets to wh. this relates have passed from banks to Custodian/Enemy Property. All assets of Fr. in U.K. came to him on entry into power of Vichy Govt. The old rule (informn disclosed by bankers shd. not be used) has bn. maintained. May have to breach it for sake of double-taxation agreemt. with U.S.A.: but that ques. I am bringing to War Cabinet. P.M. This is the home of Banks which don’t go broke. 2.000 U.S. banks bust in ’39. This has brought banking business to London. Take care not to break this tradition. J.A. Danger of losing that reput if we press the principle too far. E.g. foreign bond-holders get dividends paid in to U.K. to secure tht. tax is not deducted. Done for that purpose. We shall be pressed (e.g. by U.S. &amp; Dutch) to stop this. Transaction is concealed by the banks. Hitherto, we’ve taken the line that we have nothg. to do with foreign taxation. U.S., who have hitherto taken same line, have now concluded difft. agreemt. with France. P.M. Want to see pro &amp; con on the American case. B. The 158 m.$ didn’t give us much value. Purpose was prevent it going to

Germany. It was in the nature of a M.E.W. transaction. That ought to be cancelled. We shdn’t be giving value as against it. J.A. Total was 230 m.$. Purpose here is to get maximum amount of gold from France. P.M. Does anyone suggest J.A. can now make a better bargain? B. Will he give up to 200 exchange figure. J.A. How can we alter the exchange figures – the U.S. are involved in that. O.L. Much depends on real value of £45 m. surplus. If that is really valueless to us, it wd. offset the dud $250 m. L.S.A. Wd. anyone else but £45 m. surplus was materials at cost less depreciation? Surely this is a good bargain. Agreed (with plaudits to J.A.) subject to bankers’ point. B.B. Bankers. French have kept money for years in London. You now hand it over to Fr. Govt. J.A. No. I’m handing back to banks who transferred to Custodian. P.M. This doesn’t arise from J.A.’s action now: but to transfer in 1940. J.A. B. Govt., having this informn , cdn’t refrain from disclosing it to friendly Fr. Govt. The principle of banker not disclosing clients business ceased to apply when the transfer from bank to Custodian occurred. How cd. we refuse to give the Fr. informn wh. was in our control as a Govt. M/L. Our oblign is then finished: it’s up to Fr. Govt. what they make of the informn . B.B. Will affect disposn of foreigners in future to put their money in London. L.P. Not a precedent because arose only thro’ property passing into control of Custodian. W. Only reason for disclosure = because we had come into possession thro’ Custodian/Enemy Propy . J.A. Asked further to enter into Anglo/Fr. agreemt. to communicate all informn relating to taxes – similar to recent American/Fr. agreement – includg. informn obtained under legal compulsion.

I declined. Govr/Bank of England supports the line I took. P.M. This doesn’t breach the principle of banks’ disclosing informn about clients’ balances. Agreed: covering the point about the Banks. J.A. Going over to Paris to sign. Will consult the P.M. on this point. Finance of Relief. J.A. As in Memo. Hope A.E. will support. P.M. What is said against? W. To what extent are we going to pay for relief of ex-enemies. Italy : Austria. J.A. Plain misunderstanding of para. 8. Want to get UNRRA in, so as to reduce our share. 1/8th under UNRRA ¼ under mil. agreement. R.L. Support memo. But UNRRA will need more funds. Americans will have to pay. Ch. How have they spent what they have had. £600 m. J.A. It is U.S. who always wanted relief for these territories. Let them find the money. D.O. Will Canada remain at 8%. J.A. No. They wd. come under UNRRA. D.O. Can they be consulted first. J.A. Yes. W. UNRRA’s funds said to be running low. Shall we have to pay more? H.O. Cdn’t we have a report on their operations &amp; finances. R.L. Lehmann producg. a/c in few weeks’ time. x/ P.J. Field for UNRRA = displaced persons in Germany. Agreed: plus Report on x/. San Francisco: Trade Union Representation.

A.E. If memo. appd wd. like to know what to say to Citrine &amp; who will say it with me. Agreed: L.P. to accompany A.E. seeing Citrine. M/L. &amp; L.P. Agreed. A.V.A. At Versailles people were available for advice. A.E. But this is not a Peace Conference. ? Say to Citrine: this is for Govts. Glad to hear what he has to say, now or here. Wd. agree to his putting written statement in, but not address the conference. British Delegation. P.M. Was agreed that AE, L.P. &amp; Cranborne shd go. Russ Tomlinson (suggd by L.P.) Mabane (Liberal) and our two women Privy Councillors, Miss Wilkinson &amp; Miss Horsbrugh. A.S. No Liberal. Foot, if Mabane. P.M. Foot’s been to Switzerland. A.S. Not politically important. A.E. Stettinius hopes Halifax will be delegate. That wd. make 9. P.M. Not Halifax. A.E. Feared tht. if Hal. not a delegate &amp; is admitted all other Amb. in Washington will have to be let in. P.M. Balance of Parties. Hope Mabane will do for Liberals. Halifax &amp; Liberal representn to be considered further by P.M. P.M. Will announce composition of delegation on Wed. or Thursday. Liberals have passed out of life into history. C.O. Territorial trusteeship to be discussed there? If so, may be difficult. P.M. Might change our delegation, if need be. Don’t want to suggest topics by starting out with a C.O. representative on delegation. A.E. Want to warn U.S. before we start not to try to discuss this ques. au fond at this Conference. Foreign Service: Admission of Women.

M/L. Do it w’out a Committee. P.M. Why not submit a scheme to Cab. A.E. Because I haven’t yet accepted the principle. P.M. I didn’t like idea of their entering Parlt. but it turned out better than I feared. Concede the theory &amp; you have no trouble in practice. Do it here, too. You can use women in AA. batteries: why not in Foreign Service. D.O. Much in the marriage point. Unless you pick unmarriageable ones either they marry a) foreigner b) someone else in foreign service: v. gt. diffies in posting c) some other B. man who becomes a Prince Consort! A.E. Stream of women going in &amp; out of Foreign Service thro’ marriage. P.M. Anything in law to prevent a woman becoming a Judge? H.O. No. P.M. Wd. be ready to apply a rule tht. any who marry foreigners must leave the Service. H.O. Case for enquiry. J.A. Agreed. Agreed: as in Memo. M.A.P. Not a Judge as Chairman. Agreed: consider other possibilities and report to War Cab. a) Daily Worker: Request for war correspondent [Exit Law. with SHAEF. b) Rothstein: Request to be accredited to SHAEF. P.M. a) Saw T.U.C. re Daily Worker. Summarised objns given to them/ They accepted the reasons why I wdn’t allow a Communist to be a war correspondent. They then asked - cd. the Daily Worker have a corresp. who wasn’t a Communist. I promised to put this to Cabinet. I think this wd. be a reasonable solution. L.P. Wd. have to be quite sure that they didn’t turn a man out of C. Party for this purpose.

H.O. V diff. to give way to D. Worker now. I wdn’t accept their word. They have agitated v. much about this: &amp; now got T.U.C. to take it up: I think this wd. be greeted as giving way. Rough on P.J. after making him stand out against it for so long. P.J. I said we wdn’t accept anyone partly because of Communist managemt. of the newspaper. M/L. Keep it running – as amendmt. of Trades Disputes Act. Agreed: P.M. to say not the moment to make the change now. P.J. b) As in Memo. P.M. The compromise won’t please Rothstein. And he is likely to press for more. B.B. Only an accident tht. he is B. He represents a Russian agency. Will encourage Russians to prejudice our Press arrangements in Russia. P.M. Won’t get out of trouble if you allow him to join the Club subject to restrictions. P.M. My reasons for not saying anything about British in Crerar’s Army. Refers to prev. W.M. Concln . B.B. I favour 100% permission. A.E. The Letter Service point is worse than forbidding him to go at all. H.O. Care v. D. Worker is official organ of B. Comm. Party: &amp; we don’t do business with them. This man in Tass Agency: we have no evce against them. If D. Worker come back on us, we can say “we’ve nothg. on Tass.” P.M. Wd. not be consistent with my line to T.U.C. M.A.P. Only ground for refusing Rothstein is tht. this man is a B. Communist. B.B. If you turn him down, you will get something worse. A.E. As in Memo, if restn on messages is removed. Put him on same basis for messages as war correspondents. P.M. But how reconcile this with what we said to T.U.C. M.A.P. This is correspondent of a foreign agency.

M/L. As in memo: but agree with AE. on messages. P.M. If we can reconcile our policy on this &amp; on T.U.C. deputation. Exit: Sargent. Enter: E. Brown &amp; S.G. M.A.P. He won’t be in contact with D Worker. Agreed: H.O. &amp; W.O. to seek a reconciliation. { Postpone decision for a time { P.M. wanted to refuse D. Worker &amp; permit Rothstein.
