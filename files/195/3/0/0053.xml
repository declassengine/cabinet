C.M. 21(45). 14th August, 1945.

1. Japan: Latest Information. P.M. Awaitg. news. Alternatives a) 4 p.m. Thanksgiving: thereafter Address of Congratn &amp; debate on Address Thursday. b) carry on with debate on Address. Now looks as tho’ news will break to-day. Read most recent telegrams. Trying for synchronisation – v. diff. because of times.

C.E. Diffies about Thanksgiving Service Sund. next if news not thro’ to-day. H.M. suggd followg.Wed. V. diff. mid-week: wd. hope H.M. be advised to agree to Sunday Week. P.M. Not likely to arise. Prob. get it thro’ to-day. I will announce – some members of Cab. to see H.M. – King b’cast at 9 p.m. – P.M. 2 or 3 days’ later. E.B. Doubt if now U.S. will be able to give us 2 hrs’ notice as requested. [ Enter C.O.S. P.M. Congratulations to C.O.S. 2. Japan – Terms of Surrender. 3. Greece.

E.B. Telegram on terms. Dunn has said U.S. not in posn to consult Allies on surrender terms. Has shown him draft. Not all of our amendmts. have bn. adopted – less detailed. U.S. attitude – don’t intend to consult Sov. Govt. C.O.S. withdrew to consider

therefore deal with Greece on sentim. grds. alone. Strong

E.B. Shall never get settlement while Govts. changing. Only way to get elections over is to back Volgouris Govt. Agreemt. provided for plebiscite first: but must get a settled Govt. before progress can be made. Sensible course therefore = election first. Regent to come here. Wd. be useful if he came durg. mtg. of C.F.M. (v) Wd. like Allied &amp; Dom. repns to take part in supervision of elections. Bound up with this is M/East – vital commn link in Empire. Can’t policy here will have salutary effect on Turkey &amp; Levant States. This policy is line with my statement to Labour Party – Coalition Govt.

P.M. Endorsed this policy. Many parties in Greece – diff. posn with neighbouring States, fishing in troubled waters. Elections etc., is only practical policy for us. Constant changes of appointed Govts won’t do any good – must quickly get to an elected Govt. T.W. Registers? E.B. Were to be ready on 15/8. Not, however, completed – because of changes in adminn, failure to get Gendarmerie estd. Now postponed to 15/9. A.B. Agree elections shd. precede plebiscite. Popular Govt. supervising wd. give confidence in plebiscite. We shd. press for this. Gk. Army – symp. to King. Pol. amnesty not carried out properly. Large no. of Left symp. still in gaol – ought to be tried &amp; cleared away.

E.B. Have already told Regent re amnesty.

J.J.L. We think strongly in W.O. tht. electns shd. be held quam celerrine. 2 Divns &amp; armd Brigade there: up to full strength. Important factor. A.G. (i) last sentence. Gk. view? P.M. Laid down in Vark. agreemt. A.B. Statemt. re V. Govt. staying in until election wd. be more acceptable in framework of genl. statement. E.B. Persuade – not state – because going back on V. agreement. But I cd. bring the rest together. Want Army on alert durg. elections – to prevent interference fr. over the frontier. Not likely if we show determination. E.g. taken as sign of weakness if B. troops w’draw fr. Frontier. C.I.G.S. They are now there for internal order – if difft. role, shd. be told.

E.B. Let Def. Cttee consider this pt. Memo. approved. 2. Japan. Terms of Surrender (contd). C.I.G.S. In more genl. terms but cover our points. From mil. pt. of view acceptable.

E.B. What of Doms? We got this confidlly. We can’t communicate it

to Doms. H.M. Cdn’t Doms. Secy. see High Commrs. &amp; give them somethg. P.M. Might put them in diffies. Better say somethg. to Evatt. E.B. Better to say we weren’t consulted. We only got it secretly. No need to say it unless Australia or N.Z. complain. E.Sh. Convey to High Commrs. tht. news may break: tht. we have some unoffl. indicn. / ? No .. .. Dom. Govts. tht. U.S. are not going to consult / need. Allied Govts. Genl. agreement: do nothg. vis-à-vis Dom. Govts. 4. Censorship: Continuance after Cease-Fire. Agreed. [Exeunt C.O.S. Cadogan. M/I [ Enter Ch. Whip. 5. Parliamentary Procedure. H.M. Related matter Special Orders Bill – wh. J. is handling. M.G. Cttee – membership – repve Cttee. Rpt. was submd to War Cab.- Parlt. was sounded, but not keen partly because it was a dying Parlt. Tho’ we might make some changes, it wd. be good tactics to present this Rpt. as it stands.

I wd. propose Select Cttee. Wd. it be wise to let it be known that Rpt.

had bn. drawn up under Coaln Govt. Ask Sel. Cttee. for early

rpt. on this, but don’t preclude them from going wider. Appt. at once with liberty to sit durg. Recess. S. Survivor of 1906 precedent. Will give H.M. some hints for his speech. P.M. This Rpt. was not appd by Coaln Govt. Some approach to Mr. Churchill wd. be wise – before mentioning tht. it was drawn up under Coalition Govt. E.B. Afraid of repercussions. E.g. civil aviation: you now want to propose somethg. new. Awkward to appear to be bound by Coalition Govt. line – merely because this happens to suit us. Wd. prefer to put this as our own. P.M. Not analogy. This was not agreed by Govt. We shd. put it fwd. only as a document worked out under Coaln Govt.

T.W. This Cttee was apptd because of anticipated weight of reconstn legn. Recommns didn’t receive assent of War Cab. But were appd by weighty Cab. Cttee. We are entitled to use the content of the document. R.S.C. Why not refer to Rpt. on which this was based. - I.e. of officials.

H.M. No advantage in that. Wdn’t say Govt. was commd - all we want to say is Cttee of that Govt. prepd it. Wd. first ascertain wtr. Opposn wd. object. P.M. What soundings were taken? W.W. Soundings were taken. They didn’t see Rpt., tho’ they were given an idea of contents. J.J.L. Is it necessary to rely on this Rpt. Only seeks to apply to Cttees procedure followed on Floor. E.W. These procedure ques. by tradition are handled on all-Party basis. E.Sh. Sel. Cttee may wish to go further: wdn’t they be hampered by this document. P.M. “Here is document on wh. much work done. Wasn’t taken up because dying Parlt. They are not precluded on Sel. Cttee fr. going further.” That wd. be the line. A.B. Ask for Sel. Cttee to prepare Rpt. in 2 Stages. Tories won’t symp. with reform to get our p’mme thro’. But if they are allowed to go on to long-term reform they might play on this. Suggest therefore apptmt of this Ctee first: then consult about putting this Rpt. fwd. H.D. Endorsed H.M.’s proposal. Appt. Cttee &amp; give them this Rpt. in whatever words may be agreed. P.M. Paras 1-3 unsuitable for submn now. Prefer to submit Rpt. of experts. H.M. Or omit paras 1-3. A. Against referring to it as Rpt. of Cab. Cttee. A.G. Don’t throw away the work already done. P.M. “Proposals based on work ……” – no decn reached but some work done: proposals will be put fwd.

R.S.C. Interim rpt. only on paras 1-12. Leave over the details in 13-15 for long-term review.

T.W. You will need Parly time for apptmt of Sel. Cttee.
