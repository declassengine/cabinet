W.M.27(45). 8th March. 1945. Rumania. P.M. Groza Govt. put into power by violence sustained by Russia. Radescu demanded &amp; recd. sanctuary in B. Embassy. Rumoured tht. Groza intends to remove him alive or dead. 24 hrs ago Ch. d’Affairs &amp; Stevenson determined to resist up to firing: now speak of firing in last resort. Difficult to prohibit them from so doing so. No sympathy for Rumania: but nothing in favour of these murderous methods. Have authd. them to open fire in last resort to protect those who have bn. given sanctuary. Unlikely to be attempted if this is made clear in advance to Russian General in Bucharest. J.A. Wd. have to surrender to due to process of law. But not give way to violence of mob rule. A.E. Informing Russia - x/ wd. prefer not to go beyond telling C. Kerr for own informn – because it is as yet only a rumour. M.A.P. Worth considering how far we shd. go in giving sanctuary in future in places like the Balkans. Agreed as at x/. Russia. P.M. Behaving v. badly - not only in Rumania but in Poland also. Civil Aviation. S. The pp. by B. &amp; B.B. invite Cab. to reverse policy previously approved. I was authd to negotiate with interests &amp; have done so. Mine is only way of getting ahead quickly. On some points B. misled by my not havg. fully explained proposal. a) exclusive right on a route. Nec. to prevent people from eye-picking. But it applies only to scheduled routes wh. we wish to operate at once: later there may be other where Govt. is not commd to assign to any given operator. b) power to lease aircraft wasn’t intend to preclude operators from buying direct – as was clear from my original Memo. Can make that clear in W. Paper. In interim period we have to buy thro’ MAP.: later they can deal direct with B. manufacturers. Dominion plane wd. rank as B., if B. types. P.M. Policy has bn. disclosed (thro’ negotiations, inevitably) &amp; has excited no great opposition.

S. In dealg. with Commonwealth or foreign country, you must have an agreement and can’t therefore have unrestricted competition. B. There is simple way of preventg eye-picking. - rates for mail consistent with passengers load on their routes. That is U.S. system. Purchase. Owner will still be B.O.A.C. S. No. 3 operating corpns each of wh. may own its aircraft. B. Even so, 3 are not enough to give us the necessary flow. 200m. $ p.a. in U.S. = turnover of airline business. U.S. GPO. since 1938 have recd more fr. (15 – 20 m. p.a.) air-transport than they have given to airlines. i.e. they have made large net profits over 18 m. $ in 1943. Based on 10-15 separate airline companies in competition – wh. has brought them into front rank in air transport. M.A.P. Many weak competitors will not make for improved aircraft construction. B.B. 16% of traffic fr. N. York to Boston carried by air. B. Introduction of rlways. into operating co. is a disaster. They will treat it as they did the canals. P.M. This was decided previously by Cabinet. M.A.P. As a compromise between single chosen instrument &amp; unregulated competition neither of wh. wd. be accepted. B.B. G.W.R. have said costs will be 50% up post-war. They did their best to kill air transport pre-war. E.g. in 1937 rlway. agent was forbidden to sell an air ticket. (P.Q.) Why have U.S. &amp; Canad. Govt refused to let rlways in. Because they know they are a dead hand. B. &amp; B.B. Wd. prefer the State ran it all. (in reply to P.M.) S. Rlways will have only 4 directors out of about 10 on the Board. E.B. I wd. have preferred State companies but was told Tories wdn’t have it. Not much time to change our plans. War-time bldg. makes it v. urgent to do something. Wanted therefore to keep away from pol. controversy. Either natn or competition wd. have excited that. Hoped compromise wd. not. I was worried about rlways because didn’t want to see old rlway directors on this Board. Safeguarded under plan by provision for consent of Minister. Rlway-owned road transport v. efficient when run separately

(e.g. Pickfords). So here we shall have a Civil Aviation Board, not a delegate from a Rlway Bd. I wd. have preferred one owning company leasing aircraft. But have accepted this proposal in order to get a compromise. L. Parlt. gave rlways powers to operate airlines before the war. This will keep them under greater control than that wd. have done. Much to contend against fr. foreign competition – cdn’t meet it w’out somethg. like this. B.B. Want Civil Av. Bureau as licensing authy to allow anyone who cd. make out a case, includg. those who operated pre-war. Why do U.S. &amp; Canadian Govts. exclude the rlway cos.? L. Shipping excluded too. U.S. are now wondering wtr. they made a mistake. And this will be reconsidered (qua shipping anyhow) if our plan is published. O.L. U.S. is great field for civil aviation. U.K. isn’t. On routes we want to fly we shall face fierce foreign competition. Points on W. Paper – evidently had misread. a) exclusiveness of 3 cos. will continue. Relieved to know other routes carry no commitment. b) purchase of aircraft. Re-assured to know no Govt. agency canalising all demands of industry. c) 2 operatg. cos. anyhow will be run by Board. 3rd is national company. A.E. This is a compromise plan acceptable to Coalition Govt. B.B. Bad compromise is not the best solution. P.M. Thought this good enough to go into action upon. In time, opinion one way or another may harden &amp; force a change. But here is something to start with. Pity to throw away the agreement reached so far. Support S. who has given his whole mind to it. B. S. American air-line will be placed wholly in control of shipping cos. working S. Am. shipping routes. U.S. is making money since 1937 &amp; have never run a route fr. S. Am. to Britain. S. I’ve bn. negotiating with these people: &amp; I’m satisfied they are going to try to make a go of it. They know competn in the air must be met in the air. “Competition” – there’s no one ready. U.S. will pinch the lot if we don’t get in thus. Ques. in U.S. is not competition on one route, but either chosen instrument or zoning.

B. And I, from my experience as Ch. of Cttee, believe plenty of capital ready to go into this – if licensing authy establd on U.S. model. S. Only 3 small cos. in U.K. outside rlways &amp; shipping cos. P.M. I advise Cabinet to follow S.’s advice. B. Will you modify para. 40? S. Will make it clear that later on they can deal direct with mnfrs. P.M. Will B. &amp; B.B. meet with S., L. &amp; M.A.P. &amp; see how the gaps may be bridged. Subject however, to agreeing in principle to S.’s scheme. Wd. like this scheme to be above Party. Can’t sacrifice the immense amount of work done on this scheme. A.E. What is the alternative? B.B. An independent Board, as in U.S.A. J.A. Good scheme: wd. support it on merits. There will be competn under it. P.M. Put proposal as at x/ overleaf. B. No. If you amend Cl. 40, we will accept defeat. S/S Air. Para 39. 2nd sentence. Omit because effect on U.S. P.M. Speak to S. about that. S. This has bn. said many times in Parlt. S/S. Not “in anticipation of civil requirements”. Settle in consultn with S. S. Omit x/ &amp; include civil before types. Do we allow tramp cos. in European company? L.W. &amp; E.B. No. B. I wd. have them in because big cos. don’t want them. - Agreed. S. Debate in H/Lords Thursday. Publish Tuesday morning. So that I can get off to Africa.
