Germans feeling it keenly qua supplies &amp; movements. 11.000t. 14.000 sorties. 104 lost (ours). SEA. 13.600s. 2.000t. 9.000t. supplies. 5.000 troops carried. 41. Jap. capt d. Meiktila. China. 6 ships sunk Tonking. Pacific. 47 enemy 12 ours lost. 200 s. Tokyo 540t. CNS. Losses 9 = 36.072t. 6 in end Feb. 3 more 23.864 late 21. for Feb. 3 : 6 : 5 U-Boat sinkings. Activity off Cornwall. 1 destroyed off Lizard. 1 patrolling of Rejkavik. Many outwd-bound fr. Norway. E Boats in N. Sea 28 Feb/1 March. Convoy arr d in Clyde 1/3 fr. Russia. 2 destroyers bombarded Genoa. E. Indies. Sub. attacked 2 convoys &amp; sank or d. all of 9 ships. Pacific: 47 shot down 111 on ground 47 dam. In attack on Tokio. P.M. What units of B. fleet? CNS. 2 battleships, 5 carriers, &amp; 8 cruisers, 3 flotillas of destroyers. ie. with U.S. in Pacific. C.I.G.S. Canadians this time last week movg. twds Calcar. Drawn large force against them. 9th attackg. later were better off. Advanced N.E. Aachen to Krefeld.

Unlikely now to get a bridge. This freed the N. again: &amp; Canadians moved down. The l/c of the 2 Armies are converging. The Maas above Roermond being bridged to get the l/c running straight. Also improvg. roads in Reichswald. U.S. 1st Army: through Erft canal = well in to Koln. S. they swing back to the west. Advance there will help the Army further south. U.S. 3rd Army taken Trier. W. Front situation as a whole = v. satisfactory. P.M. a) Presentn of this news doesn’t do justice to B. arms. We have borne the brunt because delay in U.S. start. C.I.G.S. Up to 3/3. { B. 7.781. C. 3.024. Total 10.805. Casualties. { U.S. 9th 5.407. 1st 4879. Total 10.286. P.M. B. 2nd Army contribn twds C. Army. 3/4ths of C. Army = B. troops. Reason: Monty uses staffs as nozzles for pouring fightg. power v. enemy. When we re-group, Canadians will have 5 Divns (2 fr Italy)2nd Army will then be wholly British. Also more Scot. &amp; Welsh units than English. In fact English losses since the start have been 1½ times greater than all remainder. b) Why not have names of units mentioned? Monty says no objn: nor has CIGS. Eisenhower also said no objn – all when units engaged 48 hrs. Where is the hold-up? B.B. Have spent 3 years pressing for these details to be given. Regret a) “Canadian Army” point. P.J.G. In recent fighting names of at least 12 B. battalions have bn. given. Answered P.Q. to-day tht. 2/3rds of Can. Army is British. CIGS &amp; I have sent numerous telegrams for years past to Monty &amp; Alex. urging release of unit names. War correspondents seem reluctant to publish these. P.M. c) B’cast by SHAEF – to civilians to “stay put”. V. helpful to the enemy. E. said he was furious – wholly contrary to his policy. Found it was done by junior officer based on earlier instruction relating to France. d) Was thinking of message to G. not to continue resistance beyond time of sowing because of famine tht. we won’t be able to avert. Will ask F.D.R. if he will join me in this. E. agrees. Perhaps a triple decln incldg U.J. B.B. Wd. you put it out in your own name? P.M. e) Read E.’s statement on W. Front position. Reflects a) above.

CIGS. Rectify a) by statement now showing precisely how many B. troops were handled by the Canadian Army HQ. P.M. Also method of calculating casualties. Results in 15% less for British than U.S. P.J.G. Since Normandy they are on same basis. P.M. Doubt it. These are not matters merely of national vanity. A.E. Can’t we do as CIGS. states. P.M. make a statement giving actual figures, not mere propns. P.M. Willing to make a military statement – eg. on Friday. P.J.G. Army Estimates Tuesd. next. Burma. CIGS. From Am movemt. Twds. Kywegu. Thence intend to go to Tanng up &amp; Prome N. of that advance to Meiktila: where 3 airfields occupied. Also working further up river twds. Mandalay. N. of that slight advance. Chinese moved twds Lashio. Philippines. Cleared N. island save 2 bits. Leyte some more islands taken to w. Russia. Advance to Baltic. R. claim 25 G. Divns in Latvia. 25 Königsberg 10 Danzig = 60 cut off. Posn. in Czecho. improved. Some ground lost N. of Budapest. Air Raids &amp; Casualties. H.O. 71 R. incid. 37 Ldn. 52% = same. 104k. 346 s.i. 1.011 slightly i. Fly. Not certainly land-launched. May be larger. Seems faster. First since 1/9/44. 7k. 21 s.i. 44 sl. i. Piloted. 80 one night 10 another. Primarily intruder: but 75 incidents only 5 H.E. rest m/g. etc., 17k. 9 sl. i. 128k. 380 s.i. 1064 7 unclassified - Total 16.000. M.A.P. Size of war head? H.O. Not clear.

P.M. Special CD etc., help to areas most vulnerable to this attack. H.O. They are doing this. P.M. Have asked C.O.S. to do their best. H.O. I’m meeting them (at yr. suggestion). Foreign Affairs. A.E. a) Telegram Moscow. 3 hrs. with Molotov: deadlock. Start with 6 : 3 Beirutites + 2 fr. Poland + 2 fr. Ldn (one a renegade). These proposals referred to us &amp; U.S. Govt. We shall have to turn it down. P.M. We must take a stand. Must say party shd. be fully representative. A.E. b) Rumania. King Michael &amp; Queen Mother likely to seek sanctuary in B. Embassy. They might go to U.S. Embassy. But what will effect be in Rumania? He has done pretty well. And what effect on Russia? P.M. If U.S. won’t have them, we must. Didn’t want our repres to be too awkward v. Russians, but sanctuary is difft. matter. Mustn’t all be put on us. U.S. must share. Will telegraph this to F.D.R. AE. Telegram: don’t refuse, but let U.S. take their share. P.M. To inform F.D.R. a) Before we break, F.D.R &amp; I will approach U.J. – making it clear that we shall have to make a statement publicly. P.M. c) In Greece, take a strong line against Plastiras. A.E. b) Wd. it be right for P.M. to say something to U.J. about Rumania. Effect of this on Anglo-Russian relations – not interfering with Russian action in Rumania. J.A. c) We have signed Agreemt. with Sweden. Satisfy – gained by holding out. On housing, they said limits. Burning wood for lack of coal. Advise begin with small order of e.g. 1.000. so tht. we can learn how to erect. No financial bar. Family Allowances.

A.E. All-party deputn v. strong feeling in favour of paymt. To mother. 180 names already. They suggested leaving it to free vote. Cd. we do this? H.O. Favour mother a) she controls household budget b) in accord with modern ideas. P.M. Wages will be paid to the mother next! But this is not a matter for Govt. to force. Views taken = found equally divided. P.M. Leave it to free vote. J.A. But let the arguments be put. E.B. We tried to get over this by allowing either spouse to draw the money. Don’t like free vote on one point. Cdn’t we hear the Debate and consider between Cttee &amp; Rpt. A.E. Believe Labour Party will move amendmt. in favour of mother. P.M. x/ Leave it to the House [&amp; I won’t vote] and say so on Second Reading. M.A.P. Be sure you aren’t altering the fundamental law relating to the parental responsibility for children. P.M. As at x/ but Govt. will explain the legal position through the L.O.’s. Objective statement in course of debate. E.B. &amp; H.O. Unless amendmt. moved on 2nd Rdg. I wd. prefer to hear the discussion &amp; advise the House later. If the amendmt. is forced, we will have to re-consider. A.E. But don’t want a Labour/Conservative issue on this. Don’t want to appear to succumb to Labour pressure. P.M. That points to a free vote. J.A. What about allowances for the child in the insurance benefits. Relaxation of Lighting &amp; Glare Restrictions. P.M. Will H.O. let up when war ends. H.O. Unsafe unpopular impracticable – to do it now. Wd. take weeks to do it – from date of decision. 2/4 D Summer-Time. Tell them now we hope we may do it on 15/7. This wd. be a bad moment. P.M. Agree: subject to doing something if war ends earlier.

T.S. Defer until Cab. has seen coal budget for a year. 900.000 t/coal for gas alone in a full year. Appd H.O. memo: but H.O. will keep in touch with M/F &amp; P. Supplies for Channel Islands. P.M. Tell G. Commt. He will put his name on list of war criminals. Agreed: H.O. &amp; F.O. to consider that. Increased supplies appd. T.S. We agreed to single consignment of gas, coal &amp; coke. Can’t promise continued supplies: will consider on merits. Polish Govt.’s Communications with Poland. A.E. Shall have to say they can’t send anything on policy ques. There will be trouble in Parlt. Agreed. W.L.A. - Post-war Assistance Scheme. E.B. As in memo. J.A. Cdn’t support W.L.A. scheme unless it’s clear tht. we shan’t sweep into other classes. E.B. I can’t say claims won’t arise. I can’t resist them if they do. M/Ag. Believe we cd. show that these aren’t analogous to W.L.A. E.B. Some industrial wages (e.g. cotton) are not substantially higher than agriculture. J.A. For W.L.A. Govt. did take some responsibility. E.B. But e.g. women directed to t.n.t. factory in out of the way place – no uniforms. What answer to them. M/Ag. Wages. Av. Earnings 60/= for 44 hrs. in chemicals. 48/= in ag. for longer hours. Bus conductresses 77/= for 45 hrs. Engineering 65/= - 82/= That is the answer. P.M. This is a pressure group. B.B. Time to stop these allowances. M/H. Strong case for C.N. Reserve. Of 21.000, 3.000 put in C.D. They will have the gratuity. Rest, paid on same basis, will get nothing unless this scheme is approved.

J.A. Nurses will have employmt. Open to them: no problem of re-settlement. M.H. Cost less than £200.000. W. Only principle: those commercially employed at rate for the job shd. not have any gratuity. ISA. Increased pay for the future: not gratuity for the past. B. I wd. treat them well. Agreed: reject both W.L.A. and C.N.R. M/Ag. You won’t get the food. Explained effect of the 4/= bonus. Recruited as a national service – by the Govt. M/H/ C.N.R. - 1/6th allocated to C.D. P.M. Wd. consider somethg. for W.L.A. in return fr signing on for 2 more years. J.A. Give nil to those who leave. Those who re-engage shd. have higher rate, as pay, to reflect past service &amp; experience. An inducement to stop on: not a gratuity. P.M. Make it as unlike C.D. as you can.
