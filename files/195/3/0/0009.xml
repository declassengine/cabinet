W.M. 34(43). 21st March, 1945. 1. Commercial Policy: Reply to Canadian Govt. P.M. These draft replies leave the matter open: merely invite repve to come over. Any objn. to their despatch? K. wants to keep sterling area idea alive – as second-line if larger aim fails. J.A. First draft confined to arrangemts in Stage V. Canada proposing to see us through. Second draft long-term problem: want discn to see where we stand. W’out committg. ourselves we recognise the generosity of the Canadian offer. 2. Food. U.K. Stocks. P.M. At Press Conf. M/F alluded to “700 m. tons” reserve story w’out saying what it actually is. At this stage of the war C.O.S. agree (this morning) to quoting the actual figure now i.e. 6 m. tons. J.A. Won’t a lot of people think that is too high? O.L. Add “at least ¾ of this necessary for distn.” P.M. Read Minute from M/F. – reply to Priv. Notice Ques. Yes: but I wd. put it in my own words &amp; relate it to the 700 m. story. M/Ag. Effect on own producers: they must be encouraged to re-double efforts. Cd. we add a reference to items where we are v. short – “ship to Mouth”. P.M. Will not mention individ. items – will deal generally. 3. Food: Directive for Ministerial Mission to Washington. L.P. Do figures for Germans exclude the provision for displaced persons. Ch. Yes. P.M. Real objective: cuts on U.S. (&amp; B.) military requirements. L.P. Wastage 30% allowance!

M/Ag. Pig-food fell right away after D-Day. because of disappearance of U.S. troops. P.J. Therefore is “pari passu” fair in para. 7. P.M. More likely to get U.S. to play if we accept same scrutiny. Agreed: “subject ourselves to exactly the same scrutiny.” vice pari passu. M/F. U.S. economies – they control only Federal slaughter-houses. O.L. Agree these are the basic points. M/F. If U.S. make unilateral decns to cut our supplies it cuts at roots of Combined Bd. machinery. P.M. Make that point if you like – not for directive. P.M. Handle Argentine ques. interrogatively. Promised F.D.R. 6 months on this - &amp; 2 months still to run. Ch. Russian requiremt. shd. no longer have Protocol priority. They are Getting into area now when they might contribute twds. western parts/Germany. They have the food surplus areas of G. O.L. Agreed – referred to stupidity of suggn tht. UNRRA shd. feed Poland. S/S. Air. Fair to leave Poland to Russia. O.L. Tactics. Can’t start by letting R. get away with doing nothing. H.O. Think too of what we have to do. Once we volunteer to put UNRRA in we accept a responsibility. It is a R. responsibility: we shdn’t come in at least until R. fails &amp; asks us. J.A. UNRRA goes in only on invitation of occupying authy. P.M. Certainly no encouragement to UNRRA – except as part of bargain with R. Cr. Canada – Comb. Bd. members : eat more even than U.S. Shd. they not be brought into these conversations. Draft: O.L. to consider any drafting alterations &amp; re-submit to P.M. O.L. &amp; M/F. Agreed Canada to be brought into these discussions. Cr. Then how?

O.L. We can swing them in when we get to W’ton – as in natural course of events. M/F. Do we wait for F.D.R.’s reply before we go. Want to get it clear. P.M. On the telegrams “silence gives consent.” Go as soon as you wish. I will telegraph to F.D.R. “they start Friday morning.” Ch. shd. go too. Winant was in favour. AE also. Ch. Don’t want to – these are the responsible Ministers, I add nothg. P.M. V. well – as you please. P.J.G. Genl. impn of directive – if seen, cd. be repd tht. we were the people who are starving Europe. By attackg. their standards. P.M. We surely can keep secret our confidl. documents. Add. reference to continued bombardment.
