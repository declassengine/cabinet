C.M. 20(45). 10th August, 1945. Surrender of Japan. P.M. No official confirmation. C.I.G.S. Looks authentic. E.B. Read out statement from Jap. news agency. Evening News stop press. Diffy: exception for prerogative of Emperor. This may in U.S. be regarded as less than uncondl. surrender. Byrnes put this to me at Terminal: I said at first blush doubtful wtr. wise to reduce J. to condn of G. because of diffies of occupn. Said we wd. consider their views – put onus on them. Second trouble: religious posn of Emperor. Religious posn is such that if you don’t imply the Emperor will remain the Japs may push it to suicide. But you don’t know what is implied by this saving of his Prerogative. Cd. you insist on uncondl surrender on basis tht. Emperor puts himself in our hands. We’re not ready. Terms of surrender not yet worked out. Given instns that rough draft be prepd at once. P.M. Jap forces unlikely to surrender save on command of Emperor. C.I.G.S. Confirmed. E.Sh. Won’t statement be clarified?

P.L. Has E.B. seen a man I mentioned to him. Sansom.

Confirmation from U.S. Embassy? P.M. No. E.B. Assumg. surrender involves maintce of Emp. in some form, wd. Cab. regard that as inconsistent with uncond. surrender. P.M. Read fr. Potsdam decln - might include Emperor. Doubt if U.S. will go on sacrificing lives for a technicality. H.M. P.O.W. and civilians in Jap. hands - Pol. dangerous to go on. If condns cripple econ. life of Japan, may be easier to go over to pastoral life with Emp. than republic. A rep. (capitalist) might be more dangerous to attempt recovery. E.B. Yes. J.J.L. P.O.W. Corrce fr. persons concerned about our use of V.I.’s. V. bad effect on these people if we quibbled too long over

Emperor’s posn.

Mopping up in islands etc., wd. take v long.

with this, we cd. be. If not, we cd, wait a day or two for

x/ if it means delaying substantially end of hostilities.

Have J. establd contact with R. or U.S.? E.B. Don’t know. H.D. Important thing: move in concert with U.S. &amp; R. If they are content clarificn. P.M. Attitude: mistake to hold out for punishmt. of Emp. as war criminal C.E. Prerogations of Emperor – include apptmt in J. Forces – don’t want that perpetuated after surrender. cf. G. after 1918 re-creation of G. Genl. Staff. P.M. Will send telegram – to 3 Heads of State – saying we await their views. E.B. Won’t it be better to handle it thro’ dipl. channel, at outset anyhow – x/ i.e. B. Amb. to see Molotov, Byrnes &amp; ? China. Agreed as at x/. H.D. Announce – HMG. in touch with Govts of U.S., U.S.S.R. &amp; China. E.B. .. Not recd any offl. commn up to (e.g.) 3.30. [Considered news-agency statemt.] P.M. For [ ] but are in commn Allied Govts.

C.I.G.S. Powers of Emperor - discussed at Terminal with U.S. C.O.S. They agree to it. C.I.G.S. Plan in event of sudden surrender – at work on it, not yet complete. 12th Army in Burma. 14th Army &amp; shipping wd. be available to go in to Singapore. to go out – held up h’to. by shippoing: But we cd. send them now. French also cd. help.

Hong Kong – diff. because air in U.S. Zone. Sea &amp; land in China-Zone. We had contemplated sendg. small force in with U.S. troops. Perhaps some Marines cd. go in. P.M. This shd. be taken up with Truman. Agreed.
