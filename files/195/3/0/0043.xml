Truman is Head of State: Stalin head of Govt. only. But I see no diffy. Visit of one day only. Must put it to Truman &amp; Stalin first. Generally agreed. P.M. to telegraph to Truman &amp; Stalin. 2. Election. P.M. Can’t stop Sinclair because M.P. also. Suggest, however, tht. both Lord Lieut. shd. resign i.e. Sinclair &amp; Rosebery – and be re-elected after Genl. Election. R. No one else will speak if Sinclair resigns. Ready to speak anywhere outside County for which Ld. Lieut., when he represents the King. P.M. I will suggest this to Sinclair. [Enter invitees for 1-3 on Agenda. 3. Meat Supplies for Liberated Areas. P.M. Public disquieted by food cuts. Was this a good moment to say it? M/F. Had to say it to confce of foreign Food Ministers. Purpose was to get foreign countries to help themselves. M/Ag. Public don’t appreciate gravity – response to volunteerd appeal for harvest is worse then last year. P.M. Give prominence to the need. Inform M/I. – concentrate on getting in the harvest. From mid/July on. /x Let 2 or 3 Ministers be photographed setting an example. O.L. If any cut in existg. U.K. rations is involved, agree to withdraw. My proposal wd. apply only to our reserves. France &amp; Belgium – none from U.S. in 2nd or 3rd quarters &amp; little

in 4th. They argue tht. they must submit to Combined Food Bd. &amp; where supplies are scarce U.K. &amp; Can. &amp; U.S. take all. Danger of their breakg. away &amp; using their hard currency to make sep. deals with Argentines. Diplom. pressure (M/F) won’t suffice w’out promise of some meat.

W. Why will Fr. keep out of Argentine for sake of token quantity of canned meat? O.L. Nor can we maintain “partnership” argument while junior partner

O.L. 36 m. tons imports 7 m. food – 8 months pre-war } French

Has our loan of canned meat to R. been repaid (by U.S.). M/F. No. They have given no allocn wh. they ndn’t otherwise have given. P.J. 15.000 t. Macochamikie available at once. 8.000 t. p.m. + 3.600 t. bacon – cut in consumption thro’ cut in z/ ration scales of non-combatant troops. Effect not to be given till post/Election. Believe troops wd. take the cut for benefit of our civilians – but not for liberated areas. Must talk to Commrs first: &amp; also wait for Election. P.M. No reduction of U.K. rations. M/F. Wd. affect points for canned meat. Cd. use the 15.000 t. Mac. with good effect. Tell Fr. this is a first x/ contribn: we’re seeing what more we can do: keep out of S.A. O.L. Cd. P.M. ask Truman how U.S. mil. economics are going – i.e. prod on his promise to me at Washington. Saying we are giving the y/ Mac. out of our mil. stocks. 10.000 t. p. month wd. keep France quiet. R.K.L. x/ Danger to B. ration if Comb. Food machinery breaks down. W.M. Meat profit for us if a gift prevented Fr. from unilateral buying. O.L. Gap = until Nov. because they get nothg. until last quarter. A.S. Fr. posn is very serious – their shortage is such as to create risk of disorder. J.A. Stressed x/. Worth some sacrifice to prevent that. 1.75 tons .. 8 months post/liberation } imports. A.S. Difficult to say they must keep out of neutral markets.

P.M. Case v. U.S. – by holding off from Argentine we are now havg. diffy. in getting Argentine contract when Fr. are in the offing with hard currency. W. How long will it take to get the contract? M/F. A month wd. clear that, if the French are kept out. J.A. Danger of price being raised against us, also. Agreed: M/F. to prepare draft telegram for P.M.. P.M. x &amp; y: but on the basis of telling U.S. we will offer it if they will do the same. And begin telegram to U.S. by explaining how we have bn. put at disadvantage by agreeing to defer our Argentine contract. Situation has turned out as we foresaw. We are now getting less. You promised tht. in this event you wd. help us with food as well as dipl. pressure. Fr. &amp; Belg. have 3 refrig.

ships, whose use we cdn’t deny them. Posn in France.

4. Economic Disarmament of Germany.

x &amp; y. = 45.000 from U.S. to be asked for. Not prepd to cut U.K. rations. Keep z. out of it. Also I want assurance from M/F. – no cut in U.K. rations. If U.S. agree: joint approach inviting Fr. &amp; Belg. to keep out of Argentine. W.M. Decision needed before S.G. leaves for Moscow. He wd. otherwise

P.M. Enough that S.G. shd. discuss in the light of this paper.

Ch. { Para 5(b) of Annex add after “industry” “as soon as circs. permit”.

find diffy. in discussing current deliveries for reparation. Can’t decide to-day. Let R. show their hand. P.J. This is prior condn to reparations – and more urgent because Armies shd. know v. soon what they shd. destroy. Want to give Monty guidance. Ch. Don’t want this memo. to go to E.A.C. [P.M.

ready for war. Want consultns between H.O. &amp; Air Staff. H.O. This must be taken care of, in planning future of the Service. Agreed. P.M. No need to announce – at least until I am sure that on balance it will be more popular than unpopular. J.A. Diffy. to delay. For Morrison gave a pledge. And l.a.’s will ask at the Election wtr. we are going to honour that pledge. Agreed: form &amp; timing of announcemt. to be considered by P.M. 7. Constitutional Policy in Malaya. O.S. Mountbatten wants to go much further. This is as far as I wd. go. Timing – because of C.O.S. anxieties to do somethg. to meet Mountbatten. Not for genl. publn: merely for guidance of officers &amp; civil officials. Agreed.
