Black-Out. P.M. Compliments to H.O. on the end of the Monster! V - Weapons: Publicity. [Enter Sandys. B.B. C.O.S. first said wd. aid research. I said already in Press. C.O.S. now say omit M. ques. This is the plum of story. Public shd. know how near they were to disaster. Urge therefore publn of Rpt. P.M. What wd. public re-action be? Not all gratitude. Some wd. say why were we so far behind: did we not mis-manage. Not a v. good story tht. we didn’t know how near we were to disaster until we captd the sites. B.B. R.A.F. exploit in brkg. factories. Govt. well informed of dangers – more than G. thought. Warning v. relaxing defences. Comfort in U.S. will be shaken – by knowg. what risks we ran. D.S. We weren’t ill-informed. Summer ’43 we were on to it: &amp; bombed as they grew. P.M. Much we didn’t know – until Army rescued us.

C.A.S. a) No objn to handing out informn so long as Rpt. itself not given. b) No offl. informn about M. gun because other nations wd. accept it as accurate. c)

No objn to unoffl. informn about the gun. H.O. Cd. the gun fire at longer range? C.A.S. Don’t know. P.M. No need to give anything the C.O.S. think dangerous. H.O. Public wd. feel premature: nervous about somethg. else coming along. B.B. M. gun: informn known to B &amp; U.S. newspp. Won’t get more w’out official release. C.A.S. We never wanted anythg. publd : but if we put it out officially now it will be taken as official &amp; accurate. B.B. But correspondents were taken to see the sites at M.

L.S.A. Supported B.B. J.A. Ques = merely of timing. Must be publicity in the end.

P.M. Put it in context of our havg. the antidote in the latest 12.000 t. bomb.

H.O. Won’t cheer Ldn. now. They will be moved to fear by somethg. else. B.B. That argument wd. have applied to V.1. film – wh. did much good in U.S. Want release mainly for benefit in U.S. Can we have a book prepd for publn in 2 months’ time covering the whole story. C.A.S. Our argument wd. be the same then. For what they are worth our security objns. wd. remain. To give chapter &amp; verse on B. Govt. authy will dispel any doubts others may feel about accuracy of informn released. Agreed: Prepare the book: W. Cab. to decide before publn. C.O.S. to have discretion to soften anything technical. M/Inf. to prepare draft &amp; submit to C.O.S. [Enter Willink &amp; B/T. Exeunt C.O.S. 3. Housing. Bulk Orders &amp; Production Agreements. D.S. Summarised memo. Specially nec. to facilitate use of p.o.w. labour – who cdn’t be handed over for emplt. by l.a.’s. T.J. wants Scotland excluded fr. powers to build houses &amp; prepare sites. Point out safeguards: M/W. cd. act only at request of S of S &amp; with agreemt. of l.a. Leave in Bill pro.tem.

2 year time limit.

Shd. prs. extend to bldg. i.e. be expressed in terms of bldg, tho’ wanted

b) Might be expedient to turn over R.oF’s. Why shd. Bill preclude

d) Why shd. Bill last only until 1947. Housing programme won’t

Rapid movemt. now: want Bill quickly. J.A. What figure? M/W Discussg. with Ty. Revolving fund £25 m. only for housing. H.O. a) This is only ancillary. Pity can’t be done by D.R. that? be finished. D.S. Brings it into line with other Housing legn. e.g. subsidy. Cd. be extended together if necessary.

P.M. In Parlt. they will try to tack on other provisions. D.S. No. He is still unsatisfied.

A.S. Don’t favour applying it to Scotland v. advice of T.J. Extension of powers of M/W. might fan flame of Nationalism. Victory for critics if we tried it on &amp; had to withdraw it. W. T.J. wants part not whole of the powers. M/H. T.J. objn prob. based on earlier proposal without safeguards. But don’t suggest it shd. go into H.C. Want it left in while I discuss with T.J. H.O. How defend omitting Scotland? P.M. If Sc. M.P.’s want to move her out, let them. Surprised tht. M/W. hasn’t power to order components. M/L. Don’t understand T.J. He takes advantage of purchase: but wants to contract out on erection. Is it difft. because of Sc. Housing Assocn? D.S. But safeguards – only with agreement of T.J. etc. P.M. Let them contract out if they will – in the Debates. J.A. He doesn’t want M/W. to have power to build on Scottish land. That is the point. H.O. b) above: power to produce as well as arrange for prodn. D.S. I will consider that. M/L. Supported: P.M. indicated favour. Agreed: M/W. to consider takg. that power.

Agreed: T.J. to argue at Legn Cttee.

Exit. M/Works. 4. Supply of Equipment to Spain. R.L. Summd memo. B/T. Dangers in going too far – political prejudice wh. cd. be aroused by Annex. M.A.P. Americans are doing it now. M/L. Why send them war material.

J.A. Because we have got it to spare. P.M. Wd. prefer to revise the formula – as in nos on Memo. Why hurry with Miles Trainers? J.A. Want to move back twds. our favourable trade balance with Spain.

M/L. Why yield all our democratic feelings to trade considns. P.M. Why not ask U.S. what their policy is. M.A.P. We know their practice.

A.V.A. In Spain &amp; Sweden will get no change by enquiry. P.M. F.O. shd. ask U.S. what view they take, so tht. we can pursue joint policy x/ indicating no view of our own save objn to purely military supply. Worried about U.S. policy on Civil Aviation. Going fwd. with grasping efforts to get monopoly airfields – Persia, Rome, Athens. Shd. be reconsidered. A.V.A. Method of approach from Spain: wd. we supply: if not, they wd. go to U.S. Agreed as at x/. 5. Policy towards Siam. [Enter. M.E.W. R.K.L. As in memo.

M’while Siamese Minister was talking to U.S. in Washington on

somewhat similar lines. U.S. suggested Cttee of Liberation vice Provl. Govt. A.E. opposed that because wd. show J. somethg. was going on.

U.S. are more sloppy over Siamese. Finland of the East. Inclined to

P.M. No trouble with U.S. over Siam as over Indo-China? Only diffce betwn. us is on timing. R.K.L. No (not yet!) P.M. What does MEW want? S. In negotn with respectable people. Right wing. go too fast &amp; take lead from us. If we do nothg. U.S. will go ahead. Thus I support A.E.’s proposals &amp; urge early action. Agreed: as in Memo.

6. Future of Tangier. P.M. No reason for Spain to have this accession of territory. R.K.L. No. And prob. Spain won’t expect to. This memo. sets out method

to restore somethg. like pre-war internatl adminn. - Save a) shd. not be disarmed. b) U.S. to participate. Discuss with U.S.: then bring in French: then Spain. Quadri-partite occupn. Admn by a Commn. Agreed. 7. Andrew Rothstein: War Correspondent. diffies with others.

B.B. This offers futile facilities. Serv. Dpts want not to w’hold informn from R. But in past (Dec. ‘40. Feb. ‘41. July ’41) has bn. given various facilities to visit mil. installations. H.O. Problem was as stated in Memo. R. was foundn Member of B. Comm. Party. Tass is related to Soviet Govt. Our solution – as in memo – civil correspondent; &amp; let D. worker have the same. B.B.’s point is irrelevant. B.B. No comparison betwn. Tass &amp; D Worker. P.M. B.B.’s earlier argument doesn’t appeal to me – since 40/41 we’ve had R.K.L. R. has bn. quite reliable in past. Wd. give him more. Wd. distinguish betwn. Tass &amp; D. Worker. Under this scheme, civil commns wd. mean by letter. P.J. Ample facilities now for civil. Altered since my earlier Memo. Agreed: as in Memo.

Ministers’ Correspondence: Franking for Postage. J.A. Return obtd. Ministers’ constit. corrce - practice varies. Not a good story. Income tax allowance for constituency work on part of sal. Ministers, as of Members. Will be raised on Adjournment. Can two Ministers go into this &amp; report. P.M. Simple: they shd. pay. They are men who can draw the line: &amp; their word can be taken. J.A. Driberg will raise it before Recess. Want Govt. to decide line of reply.

P.M. Ministers pay save when corrce arises from nature of Dpl. work.

H.O. Supported suggn for enquiry. J.A Wd. prefer tht. Ministers shd. pay on all constituency correspondence: but then give Ministers same tax allowance as Mmebers. Need for a rule. Many concern Govt. policy – not merely policy of own Dpt. P.M. All personal letters – paid for. All connd with Govt. bus. wh. wdn’t have recd if not a Minister – franked.
