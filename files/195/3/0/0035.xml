Even if all grt. Powers agree to this text, any of them will be free to move amendmts in Cttee. Caution needed therefore in makg. concessions as it isn’t final text. Main diffy arises from trying to cover in one document 3 difft. cases:-a) existing Mandates c) “placed under” cases: no one need do it .. .. .. .. One main &amp; obligns point = distinction betwn. strategic &amp; other areas = U.S. device for securing mandates for all save themselves. Agreed at outset tht.
