Hamburg. 1. a.m today at Bleckaed: by new U.S. Corps: to be directed On left of this B. 2nd Army will go direct to Lubeck. Shd. get there before Russians do. Junction at Torgau. also N. &amp; s. of it. S. American advance to Linz. W’in 30 m. of Linz. n.e. Passau. P.M.. Patton stopped (by his orders?) on frontier of Austria? Statement reported. C.I.G.S Movemt. e. into Prague dirn is difficult. Strategy therefore is to head S. to Linz. No reason to believe he will stop at Austrian frontier. Will enquire wtr. any such order given. Fighting in outskirts Munich. Fr. along Swiss fr. along Bodensa. U.S. establd Swiss frontier S. of Kempten Italy. At frontier nr. Como. Main resistance on E. flank, where B. Army were. W. from Genoa to Alessandria. (U.S negroes) N/E. N.Z. Divn – reached R. Piave. News rpt. Yugoslavs from Istria into Trieste. V. Unfortunate if true.

Extent of Austrian area controlled by this G. Army. Developing situation. R. I believe will soon be claiming all Austria. No right to appoint this Govt. in Wien. They are in full occupn of Wien &amp; won’t give the other Allies a fair share there. V. serious situation. Asked Truman to join in another repn to U.J. Most

important therefore tht. we shd. get in quickly to Austria: U.S. shd. press on to Linz. We must get on equal terms in Wien &amp; in Austria as a whole. x/ Had hoped Alex. wd. have amphibious expedn ready for Trieste. Truman at one with me: but Staff telegram unsatisf. because assumed R. wd. first be asked to agree to Trieste plan. Have protested r. that. Italian claims to N. Adriatic shd. be discussed at Peace Confce - &amp; not

prejudiced by mil. movemts. No oblign to discuss with R. mil.

movemts. w’in theatres assigned to us. C.I.G.S On x/ Alex didn’t intend amphibious simultaneously with these land operations. Now he can get there faster by land. P.M. Wd. prefer both. Important tht. even if Yugoslavs are there in bands, Alex. shd. get an organised force there &amp; claim command as w’in his theatre and as havg. larger force. Remember, too, tht. there are pro-German guerrillas round there – it may be they who have reached Trieste. Spoke on magnitude of Alexander’s achievement- bearing particularly in mind his loss of many Divns. to other theatres. This will be incomparably greater than any surrender in this war. Possibly 300/350.000 men. Opens the S. door into the Redoubt. Stockholm Message. O.S. Himmler had our reply 24 hrs. Bernadotte gone to Germany. But not

2 months’ notice to whole-time personnel.

Enter M/H.

[Exeunt C.O.S. &amp; O. Sargent 3. Pay of Nursing Officers. J.A. V. small sum involved. But awkward repercussions. Service Ministers say they are pledged. On the other hand, advantages of Rushcliffe scales. Cannot first assimilate them to civilian rates &amp; thereafter give them Service increments. Wd. be diff. to resist continuing demand from civil nurses to same addition. P.M. Remit to arbitration by M.A.P.? Wd. J.A. agree? J.A. Yes. P.M. M.A.P. will also consider repercussions.

N. “Ceremonial will be the same” J.A. said. But there wd. be differences in dress.

Not all can be glorious.

P.M.G. Members P.O. – a use for St. Stephens’ Hall, not for one day only,

but as a permanent arrangement.

M/W. Also wd. be full of workmen.

P.M. This doesn’t interfere with that, does it? You cd. remove your hut for the week-end. M/W. Want some other arrangemt. for P.O. – to avoid that hut remaining there for whole time until H/C. is re-built. Cd. take it away &amp; find some other place. P.M. At worst, the old Inner Lobby cd. be used while H/C. being rebuilt. P.M.G. Hopeless for working condns for the staff. P.M. This mustn’t stand in way of restoring the ceremonial. Ch. Whip. Select Cttee? P.M. If War Cab. agree, I’m ready to go ahead with this. Agreed: { P.O. at worst can be pulled down &amp; put up again. { But other solutions to be sought. 5.
