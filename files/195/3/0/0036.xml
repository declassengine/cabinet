W.M. 62(45). 18th May, 1945. 1. Venezia Giulia. P.M. Telegram re Venezia Giulia. Tito has not yielded. A.E. Message to Truman might now go off. P.M. Yes. What is “attack”.

Alex. telegram to C.C.S. on action possible: not likely to be serious

fighting. Genl. obsns. on state of Europe – R. designs &amp; Anglo-American Forces melting. 2. Laval. A.E. Some case under Sp. extradn laws for not handg. L. over to French. Awkward too, qua Sp. refugees in France. Spain &amp; U.S. are now pressing us to take him &amp; hand him over. P.M. Why shd. we? Why be brought in?

they shd. hand him over to French.

A.E. Fr. aren’t asking us. If we refuse, he will stay in Spain. U.S. will criticise us for “shielding” him. P.M. Let us ask U.S. to do it. Don’t object to joining all Allies in demanding tht. Sp. shd. hand him over. Treat it under the heading of warning to neutrals. i.e. tell Spain again 3. German Prisoners of War. P.J. Shipping another 750.000 here is unrealistic because you can neither ship, house nor feed them. Therefore recommendns as in para. 5 &amp; I’depl. Cttee to allocate. One controversial ques: I suggest Nazi’s be last to be freed &amp; therefore those for work shd. be chosen first to work. S.’s memo. is contrary to that view. P.M. We want them for no purpose save to work. Wholly uneconomic to keep Nazi’s. Nervous in general about too many G. Fear diffies if any unemplt. among B. M/L. Don’t want to commit myself to a no. Estimates unreliable. a) Remove restve rule about use w’out guards.

b) Let them be used on any form of work, if agreed – not ag. &amp; forestry only Again repeal of restve rule needed. Willing to run Cttee, as proposed. Want help from Service Dpts on accommodn (camps). Air Ministry help: concentrate on fewer airfields &amp; use some for p.o.w. A.S. Promised consider. Nos. Bring them in as needed. P.J. Want firm decisions a) build nothing b) billet no Germans c) don’t delay demobn to provide guards. d) let Italians return in 6 months – proceed on that basis.

be seriously delayed w’out them. Tented camps wd. suffice for

retaining Nazi’s.

M/W. Unemplt. Easy to bring p.o.w. off in areas where it appears.

M/F. Supported M/Ag. qua

M/Ag. Haven’t the accommn for B. men &amp; women. We can crowd the G. up. An extra 100.000 p.o.w. necessary to get production. M/L. Only want to tide over next few months – to next spring sowing. M/W. Large nos. wanted for civil engineering work for bldg. Programme will accommn. A.E. No punishment to work on English farm: hence no support for suggn of food. Opposed to retaining Nazis.

M/Ag. Cab. decn ’44 limits me to 34.000. Only 2/3rds effective. Have accommn

for more in E. Counties. Want at least authy to go up to limits of accommodn available. W. Stop for the present at those we have here. 150.000 here: only 40.000 at work. P.M. x/ Start by putting the rest to work. P.J. 60 violent Nazi’s. What of them? L.P. y/ Put them in camps in Germany: &amp; bring correspg no. of mild ones in. A.S. And what of Italians we are likely to lose, [in 6 months.] P.M. Retain Italians pro tem.

O.L. Support for y/: generally welcomed. General agreement on x/ and y/ as interim policy. P.J. O.K. so long as you realise they will be released. J.A. Why not order Germans to put them into Labour Corps? Anyway condns in G. will be punishment enough, even in liberty. Agreed: Get 160.000 suitable for work under few restns. { Get transfer arranged: Nazi’s to go to Germany in { discipl. labour camps. { Then review the position again. { Cttee under M/L. to get on with this: relaxing security { restns on guards etc. { Assume Italians will be kept for 6 months. [Enter M/W.T. Exeunt. M/W. M/Ag. Munster. Selborne

4. Shipping: Indian Grain Requirements. L.S.A. Spoke to his memo.

Other indirect effects – shortage/rice Ceylon: shortage/ground nuts

Over 1.2 m. tons/wheat being shipped in May/June. Cdn’t procure

for M/F. Cd. press India on these 2 pts if, but only if, my requests are met. Hope tht. end/war Europe has made shipping posn easier than was forecast when Cttee met before V.E. Day. Viceroy &amp; C-in-C. both confirm anxiousness of situation. 18 m. tons/wheat are to come to Europe in 6 months. Needs of India shd. have preference on both mil. &amp; human grds. L. My offer of 70.000 t. took a/c. of relieving factors at end/war. Never thought of going above 70.000 t. p. month. Have done 80.000 in May. That figure wd. meet psychol. need anyhow. Another shipping survey begins (Washington) next week.

any

L.S.A. I cd. press Govt./India.

more. M/F. 200.000 t. wheat to India for 200.000 t ground nuts for fats here wd. be a v. good bargain for us. Also Ceylon is a quid pro quo need – 25.000 t. of rice from India. Wd. like to see 200.000 t. going to India if we were sure of a return. W. Pressure won’t do: must be a bargain.

P.M. Windfalls in shipping because of earlier end/German war. L. Have sent P.M. programme for second half-year. If this further tonnage given to India, somethg. will have to contract unless we get unexpected further windfalls. Also qua procurement it wd. be at expense of liberated areas. W. Danger to health of this country = fat shortage. L. At whose expense must I do it? P.M. First, let us see wtr. we can get the bargain firm. General agreement: let L.S.A., L., Cherwell and M/F. make a plan. { with W. as Chairman for sake of fresh blood. [Exeunt: M/W.T. M/F. 5. Control of Engagement Order. M/L. Made announcement in H/Commons. All in conformity with Cmd. 6568. But order must be made this week. Approved – proposal to make amending order. 6. National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill.
