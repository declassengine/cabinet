C.M. 3(46). 8th January, 1946.

1. National Health Service.

A.B. In negotns don’t intend to make any concessions on principle. E.g. if I conceded the takg. over of hosp. services the whole scheme wd. have to be re-cast. I wd. however make it clear tht. once princ. is establd there is ample room for modificn e.g. on compn of Reg. Bds. &amp; governing bodies of teachg. hospitals. Similarly, private practice for g.p.’s needn’t be prohibited so long as patients wishes to buy service in addn to the service publicly provided. Concerned re risk of re-emergence of panel system. Insist therefore on basic salary wh. will be as high a propn of total remuneration as possible. Encourage groups of drs. workg. in H. Centre to work on same salaries. Vol. salaried service:

Para. 20. of C.P.(45)3. Must be made x clear tht. no undertakg. is

given tht. any l.a. will benefit financially as result of this change.

Use formula of Cab. Concln of 20/12 or equivalent words. x in the

negotiations.

Reg. Bds. will work with allocn of money fr. centre. Offl. [of M/H]

whole. Is that so?

total.

one Bd. or hospital against another.

E.B. Central purchasing?

A.B. Yes. And it shd. substantially reduce the cost.

R.S.C. M/S. can buy much more cheaply. As Aid for China Fund has found.

P.M. Criticism of bureaucratic structure. Much “by the Minister.”

my aim. Anxious to go ahead now. Mtg. T.U.C. to-day. Then B.M.A. 15 discns in January arranged. Up to my time-table. Can be ready for Legn Cttee by Feb. if I can draft now, with knowledge of my Colleagues’ support. P.M. Treasury? H.D. Little progress made with decn of 20/12. In A.B.’s earlier memo. admd only v. approx. estimates possible. I am in general support. Have urged Ty. to get some figures from Health Dpts. Repeat caveat included in Concln (3) of 20/12. will have to be a/c offr. to H.Q. of M/H: not merely the Bd. as a A.B. That offr. must have reasonable powers of virement within the global And we shall also need comparative costing – to match efficiency of 441

A. Para. 10. As it develops, all will be “insured.” Wd. say “all insured persons” vice [wishing to take advantage.”] For if drs. in publ.

service can induce people to pay extra, you may get worst

intensified. Want emphasis on public service – v. little

features of Panel system (concentn on paying patients) opportunity to cultivate private practice. I would begin discns by omitting the words [ ]. Make it clear you won’t have drs. developg. priv.-practice out of same people. Want to see dr. in publ. service so remunerated that he can look to prosperous practice within that service. Conditions: e.g. a) require him to take refresher course every 5 years. (c.f. para. 15) as a condn of emplt.

This was in the end mentioned in W. Paper. If you concede

panel practices.

T.W. Para. 3. Hosp. Managemt. Cttees. Large prov. areas where l.a.’s have

Para. 3. second para. Why “senior”? A.B. To exclude house surgeons – not restrictive. A. Want it to cover as many as possible. Finance. We cd. expect l.a.’s to pay substantially more than in last memo. E.B. a. Any provn for “sessional” fees for consultants? So as to ensure that good men can be got to go to distant patients. A.B. Yes: for certain hospitals. E.B. b. Private practice we shall never abolish, certainly not for 10 years. c. Allocn of those who don’t select a dr. Want all these to be allocated to H. Centre. right to select doctor, doctors have no claim to those who select none. Wd. help to develop health centre. A.B. Favoured in principle. J.J.L. Private practice by panel doctors. Real evil has bn. failure to restrict size of panel practice. Cttee didn’t control the dr. Welcome proposal in para. 13. which shd. have effect of limiting size of Agree you have private practice for many years. Need: see tht. panel patients get fair deal. no hospitals. In my area of Yorks. there is scarcely one municipal hosp. Does this formula mean tht. l.a. will be brght. in where they have no hospital experience to the exclusion of those who have. Do we not intend to include the best of those experienced in managemt. of vol. hospitals. A.B. Not proposed to give every health authy. a right to nominate. Shall certainly include the people who in any area have the best practical experience. Each Bd. will be considered on merits in

442

light of circumstances of each area. This is an example of point on wh. there is plenty of room for concession.

E.B. Repve of T.U.?

A.B. At Reg. level – not on managemt. cttees. [Exit Addison.

E.Sh. Industr. Med. Services (ref. para.7)

E.B. Thrashed out on W. Paper. Leave the industry. med. services out – then

But institutional services must come in. Hospitals must be taken over,

J. What of Dives/Lazarus surgeons?

C.E. But will there be private drs. e.g. in Guildford?

A.B. No prohibition.

We are developg. such a service in mines. Does this plan conflict with developmt. of that? Also M/F &amp; P. med. service: &amp; research. Also the rehabitn &amp; convalescent homes for minters &amp; miners’ hospitals – provided largely by funds subscribed by miners. Are these threatened? Afraid of bureaucratic centralisation. consultn between Dpts. to dovetail them in. A.B. I agree with view as expressed by E.B. Wait until we see how this plan shakes down. for they serve the general public as well. E.Sh. Re-habiln centres. A.B. We will see: we may often be able to provide better facilities. G.H. a) Method of paymt. for med. services in mining areas. “Free of charge”. We shdn’t give that impression – it’s in return for insurance. And miners too. A.B. No longer. For this cost is now carried by Ty. H.D. Not quite. Substantial contn from N.H.I. – not the whole cost. C.E. How many drs. will remain outside? A.B. Can’t say. A.B. We shall have to pay them fees. Issue = shd. a dr. in publ. service treat patient for fee? V. diff. But you can’t prevent a patient fr. seeing Dr. B. who is good at his ailment but isn’t his doctor – and you must then let him have his fee.

443

E.Sh. Won’t this lead to diffy. referred to by A. earlier?

E.B. H. Centre is long-term answer. In Russia they concentrate on Clinic. But even there, there is private practice. E.Sh. I wd. still like to prohibit dr. in public service fr. takg. private practice. And segregate the two. A.B. Then you wd. stimulate a black market. P.M. Method is to make the State service v. much better. Let it attract business. A.V.A. Will you take power to charge fees to persons not w’in insurance e.g. foreigners. A.B. Concluded there wd. have to be provn for paying patients in hospitals – in order to avoid encouraging nursing homes. J. Two dangers – a) If drs. out likely to do better, risk that publ. service reputn will suffer. Nec. therefore to pay good salaries. b) Tendency to slack on a fixed salary. Must have proper inducements. A.B. a) is no real danger for g.p. service. It is v. real for specialists. b) salary won’t be the whole remuneration. Restraint of publ. opinion w’in the service – not previously available. And wider adminve charge of local Cttee. Memo. Approved. 2. British Honduras. E.B. We promised to build road - &amp; didn’t. Guatemala want territory back. I regard this as legal dispute - &amp; propose to refer it to Internat. Ct. Agreed.

3. U.N.R.R.A. General Morgan. E.B. Storm over this in W’ton before they know the facts. M. now says he won’t resign: they can sack him if they like. Generals’ Union has now weighed in. at W’ton: &amp; they are makg. diffies for U.N.R.R.A. E.Sh. What are the facts re anti-Semitism in Poland? E.B. Posn in Poland has deteriorated. They have denounced our trade etc., agreement. They must stew in their own juice. 444
