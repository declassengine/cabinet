W.M. 42(45). 16th April, 1945. (12. noon) Coal: Man Power &amp; Prices. H.G. Summarised memo: release from Forces. P.J. Wd. tear up demob. scheme. Super-priority over classes A &amp; B. S/S Air. Wd. have bad effect on attitude twds. demobn. Release &amp; subsequent dirn wd. be a new feature. H.G. If we don’t get these men, we shall face a drastic cut in supplies. P.M. Two wks ago suggd to C/E 31/5. date for ending. Commd this a.m. with C.O.S. Depts. refusing to play because of my qualifications. C.O.S. now ready to me to give 31/5 as date w’out qualificns. I take this responsibility here and now. For planning. But this is not moment for overt action – Armies are stretched. P.J. Already arranged to cut tank &amp; ammunition prodn. M/L. Then this coal scheme cd. not operate. It wd. upset demobn because cdn’t begin until after demobn started. *P.M. [F.O. to press, &amp; get U.S. to press, for Swedish intervention in Norway.] P.M. Can’t give coal priority over housing. Can’t agree to immediate releases – Armies at full stretch: fighting in Italy may continue. L.P. Any hope of coal in autumn from Ruhr or Saar? H.G. Transport will be the diffy. Prodn here: more diff. if war is over. P.M. But Jap war will continue. Propose on Thursday to cry down idea tht. V.(E) Day implies any relaxation of effort. M/L. But Bevin boys scheme can’t continue after V.(E) day. Might be one more draw. P.M. Reducg. standstill from 3 mos. to 6 wks. wd. help a bit. Can’t now see clear enough to warrant riskg. scheme in W.P. 190.

When organised fightg. over, we might try explaining to Army need for Class B. releases for coal &amp; housing. Move cautiously: and not until fighting has stopped in Europe. V. day not a legal terminus a quo: incident in progress of war, like ringing the bells for Alamein. M/L. Much must be re-considered then – for many plans based on Orders etc. lapsing “at end/German war”. Used in White Paper as point for end of certain labour controls. Must be clear: &amp; people must be told. P.M. Can make a start twds. this in statement of Thursday. M/L. Cd. we distinguish a) V(E) = end of organised resistance. b) End of German war for administrative and semi- legal purposes. M.A.P. and c) Legal date for end/war. Agreed: Offl. Cease Fire Cttee to consider &amp; report on this. S/S Air. ? Associate the celebration with capture of Berlin, not with end of all organised resistance. P.M. Agreed. P.M. y/ Coal: prepare scheme for releases from Forces pari passu with housing: but can’t say now when it shd. be touched off. Consider adding coal to Class B. Also condns of paid furlough etc. H.G. Don’t expect, or need them badly, at work until Sept. P.M. Probably some relief on coal consumption after German war because of over-estimation of munitions needs. M/S. No: over-all shortage for industry anyhow: signs now: will cause unemplt. L. And Sept. is too late for transport. L.P. Experts to consider Saar &amp; Ruhr. - transport &amp; coal exports, with Military. P.J. x/ Officials of M/L., M/F&amp;P., W.O., M/Supply: to review results of officials rpt. M/L. in Chair: Report by Tuesday for Cabinet on Fri/or Sat.

Black out. H.O. Earlier decision of War Cab. H.G. now says we can’t afford the coal. P.M. Can’t hope to keep black-out on after V(E) Day. Dim-out no longer affected by mil. considns. But other considns may affect it: e.g. shortage of man-power to re-equip. [Enter R.S.H. Coal prices. J.A. Commd , in policy, to makg. coal industry pay its way. Burden must be put on consumers. This is only way to create right atmosphere about coal industry. M/S. Lack of output is cause. If you increase it, the Fund may get into credit again. V. serious step. J.A. Optimistic to expect decrease in costs by anythg. you can do soon. Debt is concealed by subsidy. Must bring it into open. This was settled policy – to keep Coal Charges Account in funds. B. Supported M/Supply. L. This must be passed on to consumer. Increased output perhaps but not p. head. J.A. Exports subsidy perhaps. But can’t agree to concealed subsidies. Increase at 1/5 because of summer stocking. B.B. Effect on small incomes. V. hard. P.M. Agree: save on timing. I wd. have thought it better to wait until they have stocked. A.V.A. No: accustom them to higher charge before normal stocking. Also hard, if you delay, on those who can’t stock. Agreed: increase as from 1/5. Man Power Allocations for First Half of 1945. J.A. Can now get down to 2nd half on basis of firm date. M/L. First clear up ques. of labour dirn. Allocns no use w’out it. J.A. That issue will have bn. cleared by Cab. on Rpt of Coal-miners’ Releases.

M/L. Need re-statement of Govt. policy – on new Cab. decision – and above Politics. P.M. Pl. re-submit your proposals. Double Taxation. P.M. Now support C/E Memo. J.A. Assocn of Clearing Banks have bn. consulted &amp; will support me. Agreed. [Exit R.S.H. International Aspects of Colonial Policy. D.O. More agreemt. than I hoped. Want to get unanimity. x/ Must make it clear to Doms. tht. we don’t intend to apply it. L.P. Dom. Govts. View – badly administered territories near them: French &amp; Portuguese. A.E. Do they still want this, if they know we aren’t go to apply it. P.M. Why not speak on this with difft. voices? Agreed on x/. A.E. Ques. is wtr. we shd. oppose the “specific provision”. P.M. No need to oppose, so long as x/ is made clear. Agreed - i.e. as in Memo. P.M. Not for us to take the lead in breakg. down the ties which bind Colonies to the Motherland. Take up a strategic posn behind the { French, who will surely oppose it. { Dutch Harry Pollitt. Exit Permit H.O. We agree: no objn but no facilities. Then he won’t get there. P.M. Why give him anything?
