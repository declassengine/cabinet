C.M.7 (46) 22ND January 1946

1. India : Constitutional Position.

P.M. Summarised policy re. elections : Executive Council.

Hence, my view is : send out 3 Ministers.

Take the negotns. as somethg. apart fr. current Govt. (thus, no reflection on

W.).

Viceroy’s proposals – to begin consultns. early : after Punjab elections. I. &amp; B. Cttee. doubtful about this scheme. W’s breakdown plan. Situation will become v. critical by April – even if Indonesia cleared up by then. Satisfied we can’t conduct these v. diff. negotiations esp. as he wd. have to keep referring home. Also unsatisf. tht. main response for day to day Govt. shd. undertake negotns. re. future/India. Propose therefore to send out Ministers from here to conduct the negotiations. Choices a) man on spot. Objns. as above. b) one chosen emissary. Diff. to find the man and he cdn’t have wide powers to act, not being a Minister. c) one Minister. Wd. be isolated in India. no opp. to discuss with anyone. Cab. shd. lay down broad framework w’in wh. 3 Ministers shd. operate. Quickly and reported to Cab. Won’t discuss names. Want decision in principle. Wd strike imaginn of India. Wd. appear a fresh approach. Offer best chance. P.L. Emphasised need to do this job at 1 stroke not 3, as contempl. by W. Ind. Parties will want to see whole picture before agreeing to any part. W. wd. be drawn at once into major issues as soon as started on re-formn. of Ex. Council. 462

W’s participn. in negot-ns. Agree not an ideal negotiator. But a) W. tho’ not a politician, commands gt. respect in India. Unfortunate therefore to appear to proceed w’out him. b) From his angle, he wd. be upset if he were by-passed and might resign. That wd. increase our diffies. My concluns. wd. be to keep him as one of the negotiators. R.S.L. Support P.M.’s point on a) and c). No Civ. Serv. to discuss with. Thus, favour 3 Ministers. Believe it wd. be useful to form Cttee of 4 with ? – for reasons given by P.L. The 3 Ministers wd. outweigh him. Need for capacity to take quick decisions, which only Ministers wd. have. R.L. Add tht. if I am to go I shd. welcome assistance of other Ministers.

H.D. When? P.M. Mid-March. Decisive election will finish 30/3. They shd. be there before. Prpn. of directive shd. start at once. P.L. Announce it by mid/February. A.B. Little time to consider Indian ques. But recent conversns. suggest Pakistan is now much more a live issue than ever. Agree W. can’t do this. But is not unpopular as Labour Govt. is. Danger of imprn. tht. we are going out to restrain W. from doing somethg. non acceptable to India. Can we avoid that?R.S.C. If W. assocd. with the Ministers, don’t believe that view will be expld. T.W. Surely W. wd. assent to this proposal – and India recognises it was more than any prev. Govt. has done. Drastic and startling ? requd. and this wd. be one. A.B. Appointmt. of Indians as Govs? R.M. One just appt. is Orissa. A.B. can more be done in this way. P.M. No : real trouble is centre, not provinces. R.S.C. And Indians admit there are few suitable Indians. H.M. Supported P.M.’s proposal. J.J.L. True tht. W. : Auchinleck are v. popular in India. But mainly in a military sense. If W. negotiated, the venom of extreme politicians wd. be directed at him. I wd. prefer, for his sake, tht. he was left outside. But see risk of misunderstandg. Prs. best therefore to associate him with the 3 Ministers. H.D. If this fails – what next? This wd. be last dipl. card. and played.

463

? Hold Ministers in reserve, letting W. start. On the whole, I dn’t recommend that.

Indian T.U. too weak to form an element.

A.B. Take out T. Unionist and economists to distract fr. morbid concentn. on constitun. problem. P.M. No. can’t divert to economies people who want to talk of politics. A.B. There are currents of opinion wh. cd. be focussed. R.S.C. Ministers’ P. Assistants offer the means of doing this. E.Sh. Soundings of moderate opinion in India? R.S.C. A no. of such people have made this suggn. to me. S. Indian Govs. Simba was a failure. Isolation of Viceroy – agree. Halifax found same thing. Moderate v. nice, but command no support when it comes to brass-tacks. A.M. Keep in B. Commonwealth. And see tht. C &amp; S. views all known. J.J.L. Favoured keeping W. as much out of this as possible, for sake of over popularity. P.L. He has discussed these things before – and has announced will be doing it again. And he has given much thought to these problems. R.S.C. Enough if he is associated with the Ministerial Mission. A.V.A. Accept in principle – let Cab. scrutinise directives. Agreed. [Enter C.O.S. Barnes. Ismay] 2. Greece. Indonesia. Russian Resolution at U.N.O. E.B. This is diversionary tactics by Russia. May hope to frighten me into

agreeing tht. Persia may be w’drawn if nothg. said on G. of Indonesia.

I shan’t play on that. I intend to say tht. if Gk. Govt. makes a request I shan’t exercise veto. Indonesia. More diff. because we are carry out orders of C. Cos Supreme Co? Doubt if this is proper for S., Council. Must consult Dutch. Acceptg. surrender.

464

Will consult P.M. as to what I say.

General line approved. 3. Pacific Islands. E.B. Raised with Def. Cttees. Some of islands are disputed as betw. us and U.S. v. desirable to clear it up. Aust. and N.Z. are affected. U.S. were going to negotiate separately with Doms. Didn’t like that. Agreed this a.m. mil. Cttee and pol. assessors to meet in W’ton after U.N.O. Canada and S. Afr. don’t want to participate. Have agreed, subject to Cab. we should nominate mil. and pol. repns. to go to W’ton for these discussions. U.S. today not adverse to my suggns. tht. any surrender of territory be counted re Loan. Have kept Atlantic out of this talk. Separate issue. A.V.A. Thought Truman had said he didn’t want to acquire – was ready to accept Trusteeship. E.B. Ignore Press conference rpts. from U.S. Agreed. 4. Polish Armed Forces. E.B. Situation getting serious. Poles now largest Allied Force in Italy. W.S.C.’s pledge – most unfortunate – made without authority. Problem of over 200.000 men – when I approach Doms. : Colonies or H.O. I get no help. B. Emp. tho’ representg. 1/6th of world’s surface can never absorb anything! Must bring this business to a head. If it went to Sec. Council or became

public scandal I wd. have no defence.

As repatn,. proceeds, Polish Army becomes mainly officers! Big nigger = Anders. Want to be fair. If we demobilise I wd. give them same privileges as B. soldiers demobilised. Wd. like Ty. to reconsider ques. of gratuity and paid furlough. When we’ve done our best, we shall be lucky if we get 100.000 back to Poland. Remainder of 100.000. Hope R.A.F. and army can absorb some of these. 465

Rest – why can’t they be assimilated in this period of man power stringency. Wd. also hope D.O. and C.O. wd. play too – on proportionate basis.

Ask for adoption of my Paper in principle – tho’ I appreciate the points raised in mema. by C.O.S. and S/S for Air. C.A.S. Our nos. are relatively small. We cd. absorb some into R.A.F. If Polish Govt. wd. accept them as units, they cd. be willing to go. C.I.G.S. Anders = main stumbling block. Imposs,. to convert him fr. his strong views. We do owe him debt of gratitude. x/. Get Cmmrs. together and let P.M. or E.B. address. They won’t convert : cd. explain. If they turn nasty it will be awkward in Italy because so many of them. First step is x/. P.M. E.B. and I will both see them. C.G. What powers to keep Anders here, as proposed in para. 5 of C.O.S. paper? I wd. have no answer to a habeas corpus appln. R.M. Poles are under our command. Can we not control their movements? C.I.G.S. Probably, yes. Wdn’t put him under arrest – wd. cause some trouble in Italy. Cd. prob. post him to Scotland. R.M. Agree : control must be military not civil action. H.O. is let out. C.E. What of natn. of remaining Poles? Discuss now or postpone. E.B. Don’t want it announced now tht. any facilities will be given to remainder. Otherwise, no one will go back to Poland. But I must be assured that when we do get down to the hard core I shall have support from my colleagues in providing reasonable facilities. C.E. Individual natn. cases will have to be sponsored by B. authies. Polish certificates are not reliable, as our experience has shown. E.B. Must face the fact tht. Polish Govt,. will de-nationalise those who eventually decide against return. 466

H.M. Sympathy with H.O. view.

A. Don’t wish to make any further dif. approach to Doms. yet. The only one who has made any gesture of willingness : Australia. All others have declined to take more people. Haven’t made formal approach to them. H.D. Armed Forces have cost £2½m. p. month since we recognised P.P.G. – apart fr. other expre. on civilians. Want to get these nos down. No approach made to me for better demoln. facilities. I will consider this with pro Polish bias. At right time v. strong pressure shd. be brought on Doms. J.J.L. At later stage, we shd. consider how we cd. absorb remainder into B. Forces. G.A. May M/L be added to Cttee. suggd. by S. in his memo. P.M. Later stage. A.B. Need to disperse Forces into units wh. can be controlled. Barnes. Para 7. a) Want this re-considered. Don’t want land route closed entirely to these. b) Were to hand back 2 Pol passenger ships when U.M.A. ends in March. Must now tell P.P.G. We must keep these for this purpose. On a) we cdn’t get them thro’ R. Zone in Germany. And we’ve enough to do with d.p.’s Allied Council wd. delay for months. Barnes. Then other movements must be affected. E.B. Will consult M/W.T. in due course. Memo approved. [Exit Barnes.] 5. Revision of Anglo Egyptian Treaty. E.B. Will raise whole ques. of M/E Defence. C.I.G.S. talks in Cairo are beginning to bear fruit. My aim – get joint Anglo. Eg. Defence via B. occupation Force. Means at

last.

467

Eg. help in w’shops and ancillary services. Wd. help with sterling balances. They’ve raised Sudan. I’ve ruled it out – it’s prestige point with Egypt. I’ve had to delay this – Egypt anxious to go on. C.I.G.S. We discussed memo. with F.O. and have no comment. R.S.C. W.O. help with our commercial treaty. But remember tht. if comm. clauses of existg. treaty disappeared before commercial treaty negotiated, it wd. be awkward. B/T. shd. therefore be kept in touch. Agreed.

6. Housing Accommodation – Use of Requisitioning Powers. A.B. Asked Serv. Ministers to overhaul de-requis. machinery. esp. in Ldn. Independently other Dpts. have req. powers.

E.B. War-time device – prob. outlived its usefulness.

Suggest no Dpt. shd. requisition housg. accommn. w’out reference to M/Health. P.M. Shd. be pulled together Is it necessary to hawk round to other Dpts. to see if its still wanted. P.M. I will get report fr. M/W. on machinery. 468
