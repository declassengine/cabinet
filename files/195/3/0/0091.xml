W.W. Suspend on 2nd day for F. Resoln.

Wd. like guidance – what line re. opposition. H.M. Mtg. with A.G. and C.O. Friday on this Bill W. Paper shows in advance what we are going to do. Don’t commit ourselves to view wht. Aff. Resn. is needed even for this kind of thing. A. W. Paper doesn’t cover intentns. of future Govts. H.M. Awkward - Progative involved. Will brief A. before Debate. 2. Working of Open-cast Coal at Wentworth. T.W. At L.P. Cttee I expd. apprehension re loss of timber. Since consulted F. Commn. and in view of need for pit timber I now w’draw my opposn. on that point. 469

[Exit T.W.] H.D. Introduced. E.Sh. Decision of such importance tht. I cd. take a negative only Cabinet.

Admit open-cast working must involve disturbance of amenities.

Wdn’t bother about this if situation didn’t demand every ounce of coal.

Read letter from Parling. local Member, concludg. tht. E. Sh. compromise

is reasonable and tht. no evce. of violent or widespread opposn. locally.

T.C.P.’s recommn. – 146.000t. only – is not an economic proposition.

About 350.000t. is lowest quantity worth working.

[Exit C.E.] Admit these quantities are infinitesimal cpd. with what is obtd. by deep mining in the area. Rotherham petition T.C.P. re. amenities but at same time petition use re shortage of domestic coal. Re amenities : statements are exaggerated – c.o.p. as regards free access for public. Can get the coal in 8 months – restore the land in 12 months. Will yield ¾ week’s supply of locomotive coal. L.S. Have stated view in memo. Conflict between amenity : coal. ques. for Cab. is wthr. price is too high or not. This Park is only of the 6 or so finest lay-out of landscape wh. we have. Will be destroyed forever. It is in one of the grimmest areas. People can go in : immaterial how freely they can roam. G.H.G. said if he cd. work some he wd. work no more. Now asked re-open that. Thought compromise wh. I had suggested reasonable – do what you like if you can restore in 5 years. But he wants to destroy beech avenue, and a wood. Ready now to go further – Site A can be worked up to w’in 50 feet of beech trees. This will give extra 50-70.000 tons. Site B. My view has been tht. to work southern side wd. destroy northern trees. I will now take that risk. That will give 25.000t. additional.

Then we wd. work 240.000t. vice desired sum of 371.000.t. A.V.A. This is great area for Rambler Societies. Remember that. H.M. My fear is wthr. T.C.P. may have gone too far in his concessions. Need for beauty and amenity in lives of miners and others in Lancs. and Yorks. If we have to desecrate these beauties because of absenteeism in the mines. Amenity rows are not lightly to be entered into. Bad for this Govt. to plunge into one, w’out a cast-iron case.

A.B. Scepticism of miners of open-cast mining. They think it vandalistic substitute for past good mining. One of gt. diffies. of mining : destn. of local amenities. In S. Wales they have tormented the hill-sides and we have nowhere to walk on the hills anymore. J.J.L. Devastation of timber in mining areas. Save the beech trees. E.M. Que. now, this is only extension of work in progress. The further concession made today by T.C.P. goes about as far as is reasonable. E.Sh. I will go into this on that basis with T.C.P. on details. [Exit L.S.] 3. Civil Service : Conscientious Objectors. H.D. This : only point now outstanding. Suggest now 1.7.46. – Agreed. A.B. Distressed at attitude of L.C.C. – won’t employ anyone convicted during

war of sedition.
