5.650 t. in 1.000 s. for 10 lost – on Japan.

P.M. Will Lincolns be able to attack by day? C.A.S. Mainly night because U.S. will want airfields by day &amp; will be able to use some. If all went v. well, 6 months before we cd. drop our first bomb on Japan. Ch. What proportn by B? C.A.S. 1/5th at most. C.A.S. Jap aircraft prodn - effects of U.S. bombing. Continued Intell.

Military. Burma. - Nil.

Tarakan Island – half (more important half) cleared. 25.000 J. in Island. Glad Herriot is coming over here – better alone than with Reynand &amp;

* R.K.L. to report on 40 hr. week.

now allowed to visit airfields to the West. If that refused,

and we are no further forward.

or more Germans in the area: need to prevent them fleeing

capitals fall into R. hands.

P.M. a) Improvement - Tito &amp; French (Syria) have submitted. generally. French will withdraw from N. Italy by end of month. (in reply to U.S. representations) But no hope of trustworthy relations with France until we are rid of de Gaulle. Blum: wh.wd. have looked like a demonstn against de Gaulle. b) No satisfn from our visit to Vienna. Not allowed outside Gau: they wd. have protested. The R. have yielded little &amp; late – c) Prague – Amb. there: but little contact. Pity Eisenhower didn’t push on. d) Big issue now – shall we withdraw to pre-arranged Zones. 16 m. westwards. This advance of R. into heart of central Europe will be one of most terrible events in history. Don’t believe they will willingly go back at least in this generation. 10 European Asked C.O.S. to consider form on a show-down. By 1/7 R. will have 2 : 1 majority. And U.S. withdrawals from them on will make us dependent on good will of Russia – unprecedented mastery of Europe, save durg. years of Napoleon fleetg. This points to necessity of maintaining Met. Air Force &amp; small naval craft to hold the posn until U.S. can come to our aid. Re-deployment will now have gone some way before 3 Power Mtg. Strong movement will soon begin in U.S. to bring the Armies home. e) Non-fraternization policy must be modified. Monty. is putting a plan into effect for gradual change. [ Enter Woolton. P.J. In spite of R. fraternisation evce still that G. will try to get out of R. Zone.

P.M. Zones: never came to War Cab.: straight from A.P.W. to E.A.C.

[ Exeunt C.O.S.

Never came to me until I saw it at Quebec. Tendency of A.P.W. to short circuit War Cab. to E.A.C. now put to an end. Enter M/F., S.G., Salter. M/State. 3. Reparations. P.M. R. will demand v. large figure – if only as excuse for not w’drawing

labour. Wd. also prevent Fr. &amp; Dutch from bidding too high

O.L. Above G. pre-war exports by £1 m. p.a. from occupation Zone. J.A. Rpt. drafted under War Cab. Directive annexed. Dom. Govts. not yet informed – shd. have summary. P.M. S.G. shd. go out, with genl. indicn of our views, &amp; hear what they have to say. The G. will be relieved fr. maintaining mil. power: &amp; can deny themselves too. Ch. a) Only reparations worth havg = G. export markets. Directive takes a/c of that, but shd. state it specifically. b) Also wd. like to omit last sentence in para 15. If we count against R. claim the labour they take, we cd. get the total figure up to $20 billion. $16.000 m. value cd. be assigned for 4 m. slave labour. P.M. At Yalta R. made it clear tht. their claim was exclusive of labour. Ch. Try to get it in. It wd. be to our advantage because we don’t want for labour. J.A. We all agreed tht. labour shd. be taken into a/c. But we cdn’t find a way of evaluating it w’out risk of much dispute. We thought therefore it wd. be better to use this in general argument.

e.g. as in U.S., U.K. etc.

J.A. Can only be settled after much techn. discn on the spot.

Ch. Why not put fwd. a lot of man-values: [ Exit H.O. Total figure can’t be fixed because we don’t know what G. current capacity is. O.L. We do know that coal in Ruhr &amp; Saar is 4% o normal. And on that all their industrial prodn is based.

Salter. a) Imposs. to fix target total. Experience of last war. We can fix the percentage shares of unknown total. b) Agree with Ch. about export trade. But doubt wtr. we shd. base our policy on tht., still more professing it. Base on (agreed) policy of destroying war potential &amp; we’ll get most of the advantages qua exports trades. Otherwise, we shall get odium fr. allother claimants when they see they aren’t getting what they expected. x/ Para. 10. insert “consisting mainly of …” J.A. This para. is compromise betwn. Ch. &amp; Salter. O.L. Agree with Salter. Publ. opinion wdn’t let you go on for long in a policy aimed at killing G. export trade.

Kill her war potential indies &amp; you will in fact have substantially

L.S.A. No need to say we want to kill G. exports. Thing is not to build up

reduced her export trade. B.B. Supported Salter. Baruch has put out Ch. ideas &amp; they have bn. denounced in U.S. as immoral &amp; impractical. P.M. Don’t believe Ch. policy wd. withstand publ. criticism. G. exports to pay for reparations. J.A. Ch. objective will be secured anyhow. Better to stick to hard line – we take as much as we can get, provided they have a reasonable livelihood. Provided: first charge maintenance of occupying troops &amp; payment for essential imports. Ch. O.K. if you limit her imports. Want S.G. to have exports in mind – not necessary to profess it. P.M. Let us hear what R. has to say – and U.S. too. And let S.G. keep us informed. We want a guarantee from R. tht. food produced in G. shall be shared thro’ G. as a whole. This shd. be taken as part of reparations talks. Also think a figure shd. be discussed for labour – &amp; argue tht. it shd. count towards total reparations/ Discuss with R. - &amp; educate them, on experience of last war. Operation Socrates. But never let us commit ourselves to a total figure.

P.J. One ques. on which it may be diff. to stall for so long – i.e. destruction of war potential. E.A.C. askg. for a line. S.G. shd. know where he stands on that. O.L. Criterion shd. be – can you hold to a decision in face of public opinion. J.A. Agree with Salter we shd. try to settle percentage claim. If R. got 50% we cd. justify 25%. Salter. Apart from advantage to export trade – wd. it not help us to use G. labour in bldg. houses here for the early years of bldg. programme. Wd. help bldg. industry here to avoid boom &amp; slump. P.M. Big ques. on which H/C. will have to express a view after Election. Personal view = much against. Employment: social etc., objections.

Salter. Then make by alteration in para. 10 – x/ overleaf.

reparation for it. General agreement with both these points:

{ receive rpts. from S.G.

O.L. Better contn to housg. in prefab. timber houses made in Germany. R.K.L. a) On labour – para. 12 (c). Such a declaration shd. not include any policing responsibility. b) Annex II. definition of “booty” to be narrow. Then try to get subject to letting U.S. take the lead in moving to have a declaration at all under (a). c) Dom. Govts. Don’t want to face them with a fait accompli. Wd. like them to have an opportunity to comment. Agreed: Directive to go there with liberty to comment. P.M. { C/E., M/State, Cherwell, O.L., Salter. to be a Cttee on Reparations to To review Directive in light of discussion: &amp; despatch to Doms. S.G. Pawley arrived there to-day. I propose to go on Monday next. Agreed. [ Exeunt. S.G., Salter. Law, M/F [ Enter. H.G., M/W.T. 4. Coal-Mining Industry. H.G. Decln went v. well.

B.B. Much less opposn than I thought. H.G. Long time to prepare for this. J.A. On understanding tht. finance has yet to be worked out.

R.A.B. Doubt if employers can be given right to dismiss: otherwise, we can’t keep the men. H.G. Assume that. When time comes. But won’t be included in Bill. Agreed. 5. War Damage. P.M. Cd. C/E. give Cab. report on result of war damage.

J.A. £1.150 M. = nearest estimate. Less than half taken in contns. Conception of 50 : 50 has worked out pretty well Contn to be levied over a period of years – on1/7 last contribn is due under statute – it was understood tht. if damage was more than twice contribn totals Parlt. wd. be asked to renew: if less than twice might be a refund. [ Enter Lennox-Boyd: Swinton [ Exit Ll. George. 6. Civil Aviation. S. Rpt of Cttee – oral. On lines of my brief to P.M. Draft telegrams handed round. P.M. Will it please U.S.?

7. Filton Airport.

S. Not those who want to grab. But won’t annoy responsible authies in U.S. L. They will accept this – it accords with agreement they made. S. These clauses were drafted by Americans themselves. Ch. Somethg. like this wd. be satisfactory. So long as they adhere to arrangemts we agreed with them, we won’t oppose their acquisition of airfields. Agreed: draft telegrams approved. [ Exit Mabane.

L.B. Want agreemt. on principle, so tht. we can get ahead with constn of bldg. That wd. not affect other people’s rights: but no good starting now unless we know we shall later go on with project itself. H.M. Air staff want consultn on length of runway. If not to be used except to fly it off once, cd. be shorter. e.g. 13.700 vice 2.000 yds.

L.B. The bldg. is a final assembly shed. P.M. Can’t deal with this until after the Election.

L.B. Then we can’t put it into prodn until 1950. People in Filton are going slow because they don’t believe we are going on with our project. P.M. New Parlt. meets 1/8. Before then we shall know if we are in power. If so, with a majority, week swearing in, debate on Address: &amp; by 14/8 hope to go into recess until October. In that period &amp; knowg. where we are (with 3-Power conference over) we can make our plans. Don’t want to rush into decisions committing us to long-run expenditure. Ch. Isn’t this a small insurance. £600.000 for the shed. L.B. On yr programme, there will be substantial delay. P.M. How much wd. be spent in first 2 months from now. L.B. Not more than about £50.000. J.A. Case for the shed – as insurance – is strong. Agreed: provided not more than £50.000 is spent until decision taken in August. Schedule of expendure, month by month, to be submd to P.M. R.S.H. Large aircraft mnfrs. considering movg. works. L.P. Cttee agreed on warning tht. they must move to existg. large airfield. Want that warning given, in spite of what is said in M.A.P. memo. O.L. &amp; W. Agreed warning shd. be given. Agreed: a) warning (private) b) next Cab. to consider expense schedule as above. [ Exit L.B.

8. General Election. a) Use of Service Aircraft. P.M. Read his minute. P.J. W.O. consulted Ty. Solr., who advised it might be contrary to electoral law if no payment made. B.B. Ex-Ministers haven’t v. heavy burdens – how justify that for them. P.M. Some charge can be made.

J.A. e.g. 1st class rlway fare.

H.M. Lend-lease complicn. But cd. be surmounted. P.M. x/ Put it on heavy duties of Ministers of Cabinet rank: but add that, if any desire, ex-Ministers of corresponding standing. O.L. Legal dangers – shd. be cleared first by L.O. H.M. Total = 55 people. Facilities limited. They wd. have to take their chance. P.M. Must give the service. B.B. More trouble in this than advantage. H.M. Return journeys = duty. That wd. raise much less diffy. Agreed { Can be done “on duty”. { L.O. to look into law, qua doing it not “on duty” { Bias in favour of doing it. { If payment, 1st class fare is enough. P.M. Repeated his desire at x/. Ques. how charged &amp; wtr. to be included in election expenses: to be considered by L.O. O.L. Govt. cars? P.M. Use them: but pay for the petrol &amp; depreciation.

b) Participation by Members of H.M. Forces. P.J. (i) Yr. formula wd. in form cut out questions from body of the hall.

P.M. That was intentional. Service candidate in uniform – rank wd. be involved. P.J. (ii) P.Q. for reply to-morrow. P.M. I will answer as in Memo. P.J. Then I can issue instns to Army etc.
