C.M. 12(45). 10th July, 1945 (12.30 p.m.) Food and Fuel for Berlin. This provn line based on A.G.’s views &amp; mine tht. we can’t afford to

have starvation in B. &amp; U.S. Zones while Terminal is on.

P.J. These are R. estimates: scales will be considered at mtg.

P.J. R. respons. for feeding G. so far. Sitn chancy: surpluses for E. won’t be forthcoming. Hinde’s statement wide of mark. Mtg. friendly: Zhukov said merely assumed that each Zone wd. be responsible for own feeding. Weekes told to deal on interim basis of supplying food for one month pendg. discn at Terminal. Coal: none in sight: promise discuss Terminal. 41.000 t. p.m. food. R. estimate Clay will provide from U.S. stock- pile various quantities (quoted) – starting in 4 days. Will see B. and U.S. Zones thro’ till after Terminal. On coal, Weekes shd. do more because Clay provides the food. Told him to promise enquiry to see what we can do. Terminal: comes under item of treating G. as one economic unit. Two trains a day to Berlin are involved. M/F. What ration scale will that suppose? Food. M/F. Must see they are not fed lavishly – because troubles in liberated areas, let alone U.K. O.L. No meat or fats included – less risk of that trouble. Beware of slippery slope with R. – treat this as single exceptional course. P.J. That is quite clear to Weekes. R.S.H. German harvest shd. now be coming along. P.J. Ques. is wtr. R. will disgorge. Agreed: qua food, for the month. Coal.

because Magdcburg bridge won’t be working before end/month.

P.J. Joint coal organn: will try to get it set up at this mtg. W. given some latitude to keep Clay sweet. But no coal to be moved R. say no coal from Silesia will be available for Germany.

45% pre-war: remainder from Silesia.

7.500 t. p.day = R. figure. 2.500 by R. and 5.000 by B. &amp; U.S. D.F. This is large figure: &amp; wd. sink present p’gramme for lib. areas. 25 m. tons = target for Ruhr up to end Apl. ’46. of wh. 10 m. by Xmas. That barely covers lib. areas needs. That is exportable surplus. 1 1/2m. tons off this for Berlin at 7.500 t. p.day. i.e. up to Apl. ’46. L. Can you do anything in time? P.J. No. But he talks willing – qua Clay. L. Not a big figure – on need of Berlin. It is really quite small. O.L. Only solution for coal in Europe is to step up Ruhr production.

P.J. No need for further instns to Weekes, in light of Cab. discussion. L. Cd. we ship some coal from Poland to N. Germany. P.J. Silesian coal to Berlin: and Ruhr coal to Mag????? Confirm instns already given: &amp; ask Weekes to report again if he needs more authority. A.E. Will consider with P.J. what advice on these ques. can be obtained at Terminal.
