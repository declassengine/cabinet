C.M. 11(45). 6th July, 1945. 1. Canadians in Aldershot. P.M. Riot spreads – cf. 1918 – stern punishment alone can check it.

workg. in co-opn.

Group.

Second .. 50 addl. civil police &amp; reinforcements of Canadians.

Not satisfied tht. all was done to prevent second outbreak. C.I.G.S. Respons. with Canadians entirely. Our Commander (Genl. Curtis) Causes a) delay in repatn b) given leave &amp; pay at once, then no pay on return. c) home rations lower than in 21 Army First night – surprise: but taken in hand. No looking. When show began Can. tried soft tactics first: failed: Curtis intervened &amp; sitn then recovered. Policy not to use Red-caps. 100 men now taken into custody: will be ct. martialled if evce warrants it. We shall return 140.000 by end/year vice150.000 asked for.

2.500 being sent away to-day for embarkation. Others being split up.

P.M. Why not have streets policed by B. troops?

See that those responsible lose by it – postponemt. of return, pay for

P.J. to take all possible action. I will wire M. King if desired.

C.I.G.S. Shortly no Can. transit troops will be left in b-up area of Aldershot.

A.G. saw Genl. Montague to-day. damage. 2. Vigilantes: Housing of Homeless. P.M. Read report from Evening Standard.

And small houses shd. be requisitioned.

P.M. But vigilantes must be checked – by force.

M/H. There is power for l.a. to requisition empty houses. 3. Non-Fraternisation. P.J. Russians not behaving so kindly as reports suggest.

move quadri-laterally if possible. In theory, policy shd. be

P.M. Against nature to persevere so long. Why shd. not our troops discourse with G. soldiers. Wd. be folly to attempt same thing in Austria. Govt. instn to Monty – modify the policy gradually. I added: try to prescribed by Control Commn, but that isn’t working yet.

Observer &amp; Times running a campaign: Comm. &amp; G. refuges are responsible.

Take care.

Answer: Non-Fr. must stop. 2 mos’ lesson. Now must re-educate:

change, but has had no success “with higher authy” – provided

This is matter for Govts, not C.C.S. (Save as Channel). Control

P.M. Read message sent to-day to Monty. can’t do so w’out spkg. to them. Monty has wanted to get U.S. conform. P.J. He already has authority to make gradual change. Commn, subject to their Govts. P.M. I want to give a lead - &amp; let U.S. follow. Monty wants – “broad genl-directive fr. W.O. wh. wd. allow relaxation of present rule w’out encouraging fraternisation” x/ &amp; leavg. actual method of relaxation to C-in-C. P.J. he has had that authy for a month. I wd. like to tell him so. P.M. Let P.J. say so. Then inform U.S. we have given that order. Let us agree a) To x/. b) Inform U.S. c) Tell Alex. he can do likewise for B Zone in Austria &amp; inform U.S. P.J. Are we to assume tht. we deal uni-laterally re B. Zone? } } (d) P.M. Yes – with notification to others – pending smooth working }

of C. Commn .

Agreed: as at a) – d): W.O. to act. [ Exit. C.I.G.S &amp; Ismay. 4. Cabinet Programme for July. P.M. 8 Ministers for 4 Cabinets a week. We are entitled to act on assumption tht. our responsibility will continue. This is a critical time – put on a turn of speed. Running against a current of relaxation.

5. Release of Women from Services. P.M. As in his memo. B. releases – feel our way: might go a bit above 10% if Services will take it.

O.L. No ques. re demobilisation. P.J. V. little. R.A.B. I had many from R.A.F. P.J. Ground staffs are largely AEU members. P.M. Yes: &amp; safer therefore in civil life. H.M. Will go into it again: but last sentence of para 2 is governing point.

But we can do more. New factor: many don’t want to go. Will use

P.M. Let any woman go who is redundant.

tht. by reducg. 6/12 months re-engagemt. to 3 mos. P.J. All our married women want to go. P.M. 130.00 is much too few. Try 500.000 in 3 months! P.J. Haven’t got so many. And many branches where 50% are women. P.M. Shd. like to say women can have industry too. R.A.B. Assume wastage of 700.000 anyway – don’t encourage more! H.M. Accept that formula: will see how it works out. R. More soldiers now in Scotl. under training than before D. day. } 57.000 Poles c.f. Can’t get houses de-requisitioned or ag. on } the move. P.M. Cd. intensive training be stopped? P.J. Will look into letter from R. P.M. { Why not consider Foreign Legion, size of a Divn. [Enter Maxwell. { Cttee. might consider that. Vigorous action to cut down over next month. H.M. Cd. 1/8 date be advanced a little? P.M. No objection to some fluidity. Ll. G Will review be confined to women? What of miners. J.A. We haven’t the man-power to sustain the planned strategy for Far/East.

P.J. 1.300.000 a year hence. P.M. Also – Ty. control must be re-imposed. J.A. More serious still.

Ch. 5.130.000 in Services 1/6.

4.240.000 by end/45.

because Indian administration can’t support them.

figures into ’45.

O.L. Mistaken policy: must take a risk. [ Re-enter Ismay.

2.877.000 by mid/46. What we want therefore is to accelerate. H.M. Easier – but for age &amp; length of service. P.J. Reason for slowness in ’45 is large no. of operations in SEAC. – H.M. a) Standstill removed. b) Decided to reduce fr. 116 to 87 squadrons the contn to ACSEA. c) V.L.R. – unlikely to get airfields for more than 10/ of 30 airfields 20 squadrons. d) 20.000 further men to be saved from inactive theatres. These 4 factors arisen since M.P. Mtg. Will try to move fwd. ‘46 P.M. Other Services must aim at bringing fwd. into ’45. P.J. Bevin didn’t want a faster rate because risk of local unemplt. D.S. Serious situation in bldg. materials industries. R.A.B. Doing our best to meet them. P.J. C.O.S. shd. be given clearer definition of our aim to make as big a contn as we can to war in F/East. P.M. V.L.R. work on 10 + shadow scheme for reviving if we get chance of more. No firm decision involvg. F/East strategy until after Terminal. Man Power Cttee to meet: prepare series of queries to Cabinet with object of feeding civil needs at all costs. Reverse any previous discouragement of rapid demobilisation. 2. Vigilantes: Housing of Homeless. [note – item 2 is split in the book] A.M. Police say one crank in B’ton has broken into 2 houses &amp; put in families. Owner’s solr. agreed with Police – no crim. action: only remedy is action in Co. Court. Police will support that action – by avoiding b/peace.

Danger: publicity will cause imitation. Will consult with M/H. &amp; see what can be done. P.M. This is lawless action. Shdn’t H.O. intervene to check it. J.A. ? Criminal conspiracy. A.M. Trespass is not crim. conspiracy. P.M. We can’t tolerate this. M/H. First need: tell l.a.’s to use their powers of requisition. P.M. Don’t let it be said there are empty roofs with homeless about. Get a return of nos. of empty houses. Owners of houses shd. be told to get eviction orders: M/H concurrently shd. provide alternative accommn for the families. x/ Let Press be told what Govt. decision is: statement to issue to-night. B.B. Don’t publish anything until all Polls are over. J.A. Do it quietly.

P.M. But see tht. Police do stop this sort of thing.
