W.M. 43(45). 12th April, 1945. (3.30 p.m.) 1. British Prisoners of War. Telegram 745 from Berne read to War Cabinet. A.E. Wd. like to do it. P.J. Partake in G. war only. A.E. If “Allied” means Anglo-Am. don’t find diffy: will never get R. consent. Consult U.S. &amp; tell Russia. P.M. Send to U.S. &amp; R.: strong resolve is to accept it at once: not askg. for consent. We are prepd to agree for ours, whatever you do. A.E. They ask for agreemt. of “Allied Govts.” B.B. Russians have now allowed public suggn of agreement with Germans allowing us to advance in West. Evatt. Applies only to G. war. P.M. Dangerous to mention that. Agreed: not resting it with us entirely. A.E. If we &amp; U.S. agree, I wd. tell G. so. Tell the French. They wd. get the benefits. No need to ask them. 2. War Criminals. Evatt. Have discussed with our repve on Commn , who agrees. A.E. V. good. M.A.P. Disagreed: mixes pol. &amp; judicial decn with disadvantage to both. No real trial for Hitler: facilities to argue in disproof. Will be criticised not proper trial: give him chance of harangue. Neither proper trial nor pol. act – worst of both worlds. A.G. Gestapo – wd. be a proper trial. Prosecn leadg. up to charge of conspiracy to commit war crime. P.J. V. large nos. – hundreds of thousands.

P.M. Trial of Gestapo as a body first. Then procdgs. against selected members. Not proposed to arraign them all. A.G. At first trial 6 or so of the leaders: to establish the general case. M.A.P. Better to make a pol. decn in favour of punishg them by forced labour. S. Rosenman tells me U.S. won’t agree to penalties w’out trial. P.M. And Stalin too insists on trial. S. Quite clear that you wdn’t get agreemt. to MAP solution. My para. 4 is put up because I’m satisfied U.S.won’t agree to execution without trial. P.M. Bill of attainder not an impeachment. H.O. Para 3., on the whole, acceptable to me. On para 4. I agree with M.A.P. Believe all major Allies commd to execution of Hitler. This mock trial is objectionable. It is really a political act: better to declare tht. we shall put them to death. P.M. Agree the trial will be a farce. Indictment: facilities for counsel. All sorts of complications ensue as soon as you admit a fair trial. I agree with H.O.: tht. they shd. be treated as outlaws. We shd. however seek agreemt. of our Allies. S. We’ve bn. trying: &amp; this is what U.S. want. L.S.A. Advantage of summing up statement of their crimes. A.E. Getting into position – depends entirely into whose hands he falls. P.M. I wd. take no responsibility for a trial – even tho’ U.S. want to do it. Execute the principal criminals as outlaws – if no Ally wants them. S. Cd. we at least agree on paras 1-3. Para 1. Agreed. Para 2. P.J. Not easy to arrange: Polyglot court. S. Duo-glot wd. be enough. Moscow decln doesn’t cover offences commd in Germany. Smuts. Para 4. cases. Summary execution dangerous – as I said when here last. A dangerous precedent. Ordin. crim. trial out of ques. Thus, somethg. half way betwn. with some formality. Attracted by precedent of Bill of Attainder. Give him his chance to make

his statement in reply. Not a known crime: thus act of State needed to legalise his execution. P.M. I wanted all Nations to declare them outlaws in advance. Too late now for that. ? Get Resolution of 3 Allied Powers. Allow an attainder &amp; a reply: then are you going to allow argument. If not, then it apes judicial procedure but brings it into contempt. H.O. And makes in certain tht. he will be a martyr in Germany. S. Had assumed W. Cab. wd. want to reach agreemt. with out Allies. Then we can’t have our own way. However much we may favour summary execution, don’t believe you will get Allied agreemt. U.S. won’t: &amp; I gather Stalin won’t. We must therefore compromise or proceed unilaterally. Full trial out of ques. But advantages in a) putting fwd. a document of our case. You cd. do that &amp; then execute w’out opportunity of reply. Or b) go further &amp; have tribunal to deal shortly with his answer. c.f. Allied statement re Napoleon after Waterloo. Draw up document now. P.M. Wd. agree to a) &amp; execution. Will not agree to trial which can only be a mock trial. H.O. Put these arguments to U.S. &amp; R. Fraser. Simon, Evatt, Smuts &amp; Cripps cd. marshall the arguments. P.M. Let U.S. &amp; R. deploy their case, while we hold back. I wd. protect myself by Act of Attainder. M.A.P. Have one Act against the whole bunch. S/S Air. If Hitler is a soldier, we can refuse to give him quarter. P.M. Get S. Fr. to establish a list of grand criminals &amp; get them to agree that these may be shot when taken in the field. M.A.P. Document of arraignment v. Nazi Party. Hand it to any captured. Give them 2 wks to reply. Then shoot. A.G. { Can we transmit to Stimson the objns to even the mock trial. } x/ { } H.O. { Also accepting paras 1 – 3. }
