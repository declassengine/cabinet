C.M. 10(45). 20th June, 1945. 1. Disposal of German War Material in relation to Reparation. they can.

J.A. Booty: in internatl law the line is drawn at general surrender. Complicn: U.S. &amp; B. Armies are w’drawing from areas wh. they occupied &amp; will have to leave behind to R. some material wh. cd. be claimed as booty: reasonable to regard this as w’in reparation. Further ques.: shd. amount of booty be included in reparation total. Recommendations – as in para. 15. A.C. F.O. Agree. A.S. Agreed. Ch. Academic because R. won’t tell us anything anyhow &amp; will take all O.L. Rpt. tht. R. are removing plant en bloc from Austria. Pity our instructions are so negative. It is to our interest to get the booty credited to reparations total. A.S. Para (ii) – wd. have to be bi-lateral. R. must have same rights of inspection in our zone. Agreed. [ Exit Salter. 2. Greece. security. Make it certain they’ll ask us for help against foreign

A.C. Two main suggns a) restrict G. armed forces. b) initial equipmt. of 100.000: but let G. maintain. See top of p.2. Further devel. since. Confn with Scobie, who has proposed extended powers for B. Mil. Mission to dismiss undesirable members of G. mil. forces. Alex is against. C.O.S. have recommd P.M. to endorse Scobie’s proposal. O.L. Is it wise for us to propose limiting to what is requd for internal enemy. They wd. use the words v. us. Put it more general grounds. J.A. Fix a figure: as what they can manage: urge them to reduce to that &amp; maintain them. For us to maintain weakens their sense of responsibility. Ch. Shd. we not press them to balance their budget.

pegging prices. The V. plan is right: ques. is wtr. they will have

Agreed: Plus F.O. to consider x/.

J.A. Improvement in financial posn since Varvaressos apptd. They have, however, a hard row to hoe. Now on right lines. Memo. is out of date. O.L. x/ Anglo-Am. Prodn Mission wd. help. J.A. Wish to find out first wtr. V. wd. agree. R.A.B. Economic situation dangerous. Wages are pegged &amp; prices aren’t. J.A. That is prob. out of date. They have started on V. plan which includes the courage to put it into effect. 3. Civil Aviation: Filton Airfield. Ch. Asked to sponsor this Memo. Cab. was disposed to agree if not more than £50.000 in first few months. This shows only £32.000 in first 2 months. Support therefore subject to Ty. scrutiny of total: £675.000 for assembly shed is v. gt.

R.A.B. Alarming qua labour. 250 – to peak of 1.000 for 3 mos. at 5th month. {1/2 mill. man-hours. Ch. 230 ft. span of the aircraft. We can’t afford to be w’out experience of v. big aircraft because they will prob. be useful militarily. Might be able to defend

themselves v. fighters.

O.L. V. expensive experiment. J.A. We’ve accepted the policy. Can’t now re-open it. Only ques. now is wtr. immediate expenditure is justified. Figure will be within prev. Cab. decision. Minister shd. go ahead. Agreed. 4. Three Power Meeting. P.M. Results of Electon 26/7. Poll 5/7.

of Election not known. Had thought we cd. have solid front if

Yalta = 9 working days. King’s visit = dies non Feel now it may be awkward to talk during this interval, when results CRA came too – his added declns wd. give us watertight decln

of policy.

stressed in later speeches: &amp; CRA

can clearly be responsible for B. policy. Had hoped it might be

15/8: but if it were CRA Govt. fear it cdn’t be earlier than

But intervention of Laski a) CRA only an observer. That is solved by formula “friend &amp; counsellor”: &amp; CRA and E.B. reject the observer doctrine. b) no guarantee of continuity of foreign policy. This, Laski has has not denied it. Don’t feel therefore tht. integrity of my position is assured. Don’t believe there is in fact any divergence of view between me &amp; CRA on foreign policy – e.g. on Greece, Yugoslavia, Syria, Russia. But CRA’s agreement is challenged by leader of Socialist Party. I shd. be leaning on a broken crutch. Occurred to me therefore tht. it might be better to wait until someone x/ 30/8 – unless E.B. as Foreign Secretary went in advance of debate on new Govt. policy: he cd. then get off by 15/8 or so. Not therefore unreasonable to suggest postponement on grd. tht. CRA’s credentials are imperfect. It wd. of course be all right if they got rid of Laski. The Soc. Party Executive are mtg. to-morrow to discuss – in light of Laski’s speech at Nottingham contemplating violence. B.B. Risky: a) public wdn’t like to feel mtg. [Enter Margesson postponed because party politics. b) risk that Truman &amp; Stalin might meet alone. P.M. I wdn’t press the point as far as that. Not sure tht. Stalin wdn’t prefer it – recent request for postponement of withdrawal to Zones, to 1/7: that wd. be a peg on which to hang my approach in new situation. B.B. Strong case: Laski has said they will be free to repudiate decisions reached. P.M. Delay wd. not be my fault: wd. throw light on divisions in Labour Party. Have read draft telegrams to A.E. He is willing. I’m not decided. Some of the urgent causes have disappeared – V. Giulia &amp; Carinthia: 1st + 2nd Ukranian Armies reptd. moving back into R. – others moving east. Read out draft telegrams. Change: ask Truman before approaching U.J. X EEB. to reconsider dates on assumption at x/ overleaf. X

A.C. Delay. Some of most urgent reasons have gone – add Poland.

R.A.F. ~But may not be necessary. [Enter B’brook

Agreed: no objection to postponement.

Wd. it be enough to say “not before 15/8.”

Delay of about a month wd. not be detrimental, from F.O. angle. P.M. C.O.S. no mil objection to postponement. But continuation of standstill until after Ang. ~Terminal wd. be awkward esp. for P.M. Ques. then is wtr. it wd. be pol. advantageous. Discussion ensued on Laski incident. J.A. Can you put the 15/8 as a firm date when it will be for CRA to decide? B. Important tht. telegrams shd. not appear to contemplate a Govt. defeat. Shd. be hypothetical.
