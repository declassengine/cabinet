C.M. 23(45). 16th August, 1945. 1. Man Power. E.B. As in my note re 900.000. Intake – 160.000. Release of ex-miners – not to be announced because will cause ramp. Let it average out at 10% quietly. Easy to deal with miners because of earlier enquiries. Won’t affect B. releases for bldg. or specialists. T.W. Agric. needs man-power. Only getting 50 p. month under Cl. B., while call-up from ag. continues. Want early considn of B. releases for agriculture. Barnes. Machinery to get Dpts’ views? E.B. Man Power Cttee. Agriculture. Don’t press for B. releases. Need for special care to avoid trouble in Forces. But have mentioned need for harvest labour, with W.O. at M.P. Cttee. They are ready to lend mil. labour awaitg. demobn: but farmers haven’t applied for it. If C.O.’s make any diffy W.O. will deal with them. But farmers wait until they are in a real hole. Catchy season for weather: must get in all we can. M/Ag. shd. meet Farmers Union. T.W. Any complaints of farmers’ refusing labour shd. be sent to me. E.B. Farmers shd. take the initiative. P.M. Old diffy – farmers not applying in good time. M/Ag. shd. get on to the farmers. H.D. Stressed importce of gettg. in harvest because of foreign exchange. P.M. This rpt. = broad outline. Details for M.P. Cttee. E.Sh. Increased release in A is more useful than juggling with B. Memo. to M.P. Cttee. Priorities: open-cast, skilled men. maintaining gas supply Miners: don’t be sure nos. will automat. increase prodn : problem of absorption at coal-face. Workg. out of release scheme: must consult with M/L. &amp; Serv. Dpts. A.B. Don’t believe this statement will be popular. Dissatisfn with increased rate of releases. Dissatisfn with Service use of women. 246

W.O. frustration of Cab. decns. e.g. doctors don’t come out. can’t get techn. specialists for housing. J.J.L. I will go into these ques. personally if details given to me. Women doing men’s work – e.g. pay corps etc. Give me evidence &amp; I will investigate. E.B. Let Ministers meet with M/L. &amp; examine the facts. Take doctors: we were on edge of scandal in Burma because of shortage of drs. Housing specialists. Any M/L. must hold a balance. Nearly all were officers – risk of trouble in Army. Now W.O. will prob. be able to be more forthcoming. Many will now come out in CL.A – because Territorials &amp; early groups. Town Clerks posts – 19 and 20 yrs. of age as “experts”. Monkeying with demob. scheme can get this Govt. into real trouble. Let M/L. go into these ques. on his Cttee: &amp; if they can’t settle bring it to M.P. Cttee. J.J.L. Let these allegns be handled by M.P. Cttee. H.M. a) Doctors – W.S.C. attack on W.O. New Sys. shd. shake them up. b) Cdn’t review be completed before end/Sept. R.S.C. C.O.S. can’t complete before 1/9. H.M. c) M/L. think no risk of serious unemplt. Think again? - large releases fr. munitions. Shd. any special action be taken re unemplt. P.M. Serv. Dpts. tied to “establmts”. Ministers must fight Dpts on that. Pay depends on no. of subordinates. All Ministers must watch this. E.B. At D. Cttee suggd Services shd. pool drs. &amp; nurses. Ministers must consider that too. On publn. C.F.M. Sept. Don’t want any indicn of weakening our occupl forces. After C.F.M. we cd. go ahead. A.V.A. We will examine P.M.’s pts. on drs. But we were working to 60% of establmts. Serv. Dpts. must help Col. services in East – to prevent disease in areas left by J. J.W. Intake. Cdn’t we delay call-up of apprentices? E.B. We have agreed that M/L. will revise dirns on deferments. Barnes. Re-consider personnel of M.P. Cttee – now we are drawing out.

P.M. Cttee. consists of 3 civilian Ministers – balance claims of civil Dpts. &amp; hear their views. Barnes. Round-table talk preferable to individual hearings. E.B. Don’t object to one such talk. A.B. Statement to-day. Step up rate. Barnes. Wd. prefer it reversed. Encouragement first. E.Sh. Need for caution. Less said the better. But can’t ignore the facts. Raise hopes of faster demobn than facts &amp; internatl sitn allow. E.B. Supported this. Remember Allies, who rely on our support. J.J.L. Don’t ignore the principles of re-allocn . We haven’t discussed them here. You don’t know our diffies – e.g. p.o.w. from F/East &amp; organn needed to handle. P.M. Genl. points: a) Allies: occupation duties. b) Orderly and fair. Maintain principles accepted by Forces. c) Need to avoid up-setting Forces or civil popn. Two amendmts. of statement approved – as in ms E.B. Machinery. Offl. Cttee to start with - under N.B. [Agreed. H.M. Statement on future of controls? P.M. Am saying somethg to-day, in genl. terms. Can be followed up later. Munitions Industries. R.S.C. Most points in this covered in discn. Notice re contracts has bn. put out. Unemplt. Because of nos. who will go out of industry, M/L. doesn’t expect any general unemplt. Where option, steps will be taken to release where labour can be absorbed. H.D. Concerned – esp. on exped. exports. Storage: no progress under Caretaker Govt. Want to get on now – Serv. Dpts must co-operate now. H.M. Holiday or (E.B.) 3 wks’ notice? M/L. Not necessary. Forces releases will have holidays &amp; leaves opp. to munitions releases. 248

H.M. Need to avoid claim for genl. increase in unemplt. pay. E.B. 3 wks’ notice to be arranged by Dpts, not by general order. They go on paying if M/L. can’t re-absorb, but only if: no general rule. 2. Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Bill. C.E. Duration: 5 years not 2. L.P. agrees. My advisers are against extending duration. My view: in 2 years’ time to have to move aff. Resolution wd. be v. difficult – might be stopped by H/Lords. Let’s be hanged as sheep. A.G. Trouble anyway: let us have it. H.M. Apart from H/L danger: important thing is to establish at once doctrine tht. the next 5 years of transition is as diff. as was the war. E.B. There is another side to this. The real trouble last time didn’t begin for 2 years. If you had had control you wd. have avoided 1921, 1924 &amp; 1926 industrial crises. The argument for this Bill is tht. it provides powers to prevent this. H.D. Finance – favour 5 years. This Bill contains somethg. on fin. controls. But I want perm. powers over exchange &amp; cap. issues – in another Bill. Agreed: 5 years with renewal on affirm. Resoln. H.M. Intended to present just before recess. If earlier wd. block discn in debate on Address. A.B. Want early powers – to requisition houses; control bldg. prices. H.M. L.O. say you can do what you want at once under E.P.(D.) Acts. 3. British North Borneo. G.H. This is only Charter Co, in B. Empire. Explained proposal – as in memo. H.D. No objn so long as finance is reserved. Not commd to any expendre. Agreed. A. We told Dom. Govts to treat this as secret. Must tell them first. Agreed. 4. Overseas Financial Prospects.
