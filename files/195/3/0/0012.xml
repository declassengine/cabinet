W.M. 37(45). 28th March, 1945. 1. Channel Islands: Proposed Warning to German Commander. H.O. Evce not conclusive. Official warning not wise. If any, better give it unofficially. M.A.P. Let events be a sufficient warning. Agreed: no action. 2. Asylum for Refugees. F.O. No criticism now that we haven’t done enough. No need to do anything. 3. Double Taxation. Agreement with U.S.A. J.A. Case for such an agreement. V. high rates create new problem. Will be serious obstacle intern. intercourse unless some relief. Only agreemts now with Doms. &amp; those not v. satisfy. to us. Hope this Treaty may be model. We’ve secured all our demands save one. Apart fr. obvious case U.S. agreed a) treat c. aviatn as shipping: tax only where co. is based, i.e. where effective control is. b) taxn on interests or all royalties will be levied only in country of receipt. U.S. tax is now levied on interest on U.S. loans: as it is not on our War loans. c) U.S. withholding tax (imposed on dividends paid abroad in addn to ordinary tax on the firm’s profits) – at 30% on us. We asked for nil: they have agreed to reduce to 15% wh. is special rate they now give to Canada. Thus we stand to gain substantially, both as a Govt. &amp; as individuals. Discns showed no chance of Agreemt. unless we will go some way to meet them on exchange of informn . They tried to get us to act as collectors: then asked for lists of individuals: we got them down in the end to informn wh. we think necessary to prevent fraud &amp; avoidance. Diff. to refuse reciprocal exchange of this information. It is informn relevant only to the taxable income, In reply to M/L: does have the result tht. a man pays no more than the higher rate of either. B. Such an Agreement may not benefit U.K. Depends on balance income paid here on U.S. earnings &amp; income paid in U.S. on U.K. earnings. J.A. Disagree: first ques. is effect of taxpayer, not on revenue.

We cdn’t leave them under d. taxation merely because it paid the

Exchequer. Anyway you can’t estimate in advance. B. My main objn is interference with intern. money market. Affects shares of non-residents who send their money here (hot money) to escape unjust U.S. taxation. Finance Act ’39 enabled us to refuse informn to U.S. This proposal wd. bring the hot-money market to an end: to the loss of lawyers, accountants, banks etc. The U.S. will then get the hot money market. U.S. taxation system is intolerable. Taxation by difft. States. The Banks here enable U.S. residents to escape this. Disclosure will break the racket. Similar racket in Nassau will be stopped. J.A. Doesn’t affect Nassau at all. Agreemt. doesn’t expose a/c. of Banks to U.S. inspn . How can we refuse to disclose informn requd to prevent fraud &amp; avoidance. Wd. the Banks use B.’s arguments? Examples: a) U.S. owned firm in Glasgow supplying goods to U.S. w’out profit. Pays no U.K. tax. We shd. be able to check their returns by informn from U.S. b) U.S. have agreed to reduce w’holdg tax to 15% for B.s while retaining 30% for others. They will deduct 15% from all div. issued for paymt. in U.K. but will want returns from us of foreigners resident here who aren’t entitled to the 15% rebate B/England think tht. where evasion clearly shown informn shd. be disclosed if nec. to deal with it. Nec. for reputn of City. B. On ethics. a) evasion b) avoidance. B. courts have said b) is legitimate. U.S. taxation authies are ruthless. They have in past attacked B. Banks as responsible for capital gains taxes. They haven’t our experience of taxation methods &amp; principles. Risk of exposing to these sharks foreigners who’ve sought protection here. J.A. This Agreement is concerned in the main with plain evasion: not avoidance. B.B. a) Is this a good bargain? We’ve sold out our investments in U.S.: the U.S. holdings here are enormous. b) J.A. referred to tax-free loans issued here. £13 m.p.a. profit made by City because of its skill, efficiency &amp; reputn . Disclosure of foreigners balance will prejudice this. B. Bankers Assocn &amp; Clearing Banks wd. take a difft. view. Must not interfere with their earning capacity.

J.A. Carry a principle too far &amp; you will endanger the system – too far = using secrecy tradn to cover up known evasion. This is in interests of B. traders: can’t estimate precise balance in future. M/L. General bona fide trading is bound to benefit. Hot money market may not. Which is the more important. Qua emplt. first certainly outweighs second. J.A. Clearing Banks won’t give an opinion until they see Agreement as a whole. P.M. What is the urgency? Climax of war: diffies of foreign political ques.: problems of demobilisation. J.A. For exactly that reason. Resumption of foreign trade. Just as important as Income tax reliefs on development &amp; re-equipment. Double taxation is a barrier now to international trade. A.E. Why not limit to U.S. nationals? J.A. It is U.S. taxation liability, whatever the nationality. W. Does J.A. propose to disclose any informn other than what I. Rev. already have? J.A. No. Limited to informn already available to us for purposes of our own tax law. M/L. Risk of hurting the hot money market is nothg. compared with value to genuine trading. J.A. Remember this is reciprocal. U.S. companies here may be doing us in the eye. M.A.P. Don’t overlook the solid advantages of the Agreement. 15% on w’holdg tax. 30% on royalties etc. All more dollars for us. The more U.S. money here exceeds U.K. money there, the more we benefit: for we charge the whole U.K. tax and receive. B. We cd. get these advantages without disclosing. Canada has done it: they have always refused &amp; yet secured the 15% rate. J.A. Gregg says no chance at all of getting the Agreement w’out going as far as this on disclosure.

P.M. Don’t accept a moral obligation to play the detective for U.S. tax authorities. Gain to Revenue? J.A. Any double taxn agreemt. must involve some loss of revenue to both countries. The inevitable loss of revenue if offset by larger advantages. Will be more than outweighed by subsequent increase in income due to expansion of trade. There will be criticism from Banks: how much I can’t say. Haven’t bn. able to disclose while under discn with U.S. authies. P.M. Can’t you consult one or two Bankers in confidence? J.A. Yes: if Cabinet authorise me to do so. H.O. Supported J.A.. O.S. V. advantageous to traders. Wd. be necessary to show v. great damage to banks to outweigh that. Ch. Gain to trader seems to exceed loss to banker. Will attract U.S. money here because they will have only single taxation. We don’t want that by way of buying up B. firms: we do want it by way of starting new businesses here. [ Exit M.A.P. P.M. a) Figures: how much hot money .. .. U.K. .. } } .. .. U.S. money} wd. be affected } ? } } B. And amount of trading profits which will be touched by it.} P.M. b) Alternatively, ask some Bankers in confidence? General sympathy with J.A. proposals: but review on results of a) and b). 4. Trade Union Representation at San Francisco. A.E. Delegation large &amp; representative enough as it is. P.M. What have they to do with this? BS. Give way to him; and you can’t deny the Churches. M/L. Keep it to Govt’s. Agreed: decision to be commd by letter.

M/L. I.L.O. shd. not be merely an observer. Russian views. Don’t invite her to come back into I.L.O. Let her come in automatically thro’ membership of world organisation. A.E. Give me a memo. &amp; I will approach the U.S.A. 5. Poland. A.E. Interview with R. Amb. P.M. Perhaps R. may refuse to go to ‘Frisco. Stalin’s telegram re p. of w. Shall ask him for examples. 6. Poland. Naturalisation &amp; Settlement. P.M. The Dom. replies are not unpromising. Why not naturalise them even tho’ it doesn’t carry admission to B. Doms? Useful for occupn of Germany as B. force, releasing B. soldiers to come home. Then, if things don’t clear up, we will give you B. nationality. H.O. Want an opportunity to put counter-arguments. P.M. a) gratitude to the Poles b) population is wealth. c) precedent K.O. German Legion settled in Africa: stayed steady with British in Boer War. H.O. My Dpt. views must be heard. P.M. My honour is engaged. M/L. Any chance to consult France, who always had large Polish labouring popn. Wd. she not wish to recover what she regarded as fruitful? This wd. be a useful contribution. H.O. a) This represents large no. of foreign population. 3 of 4 Doms. hold out no hope of taking any. b) Many of those who’ve passed thro’ the Army are pretty poor people. Many had no serious intention of fighting: the adminn has bn. shoddy. Many also are Fascists. c) Many other lots of foreigners want to stay here. Many have “fought” in Pioneers to escape internment. They will press for what you give to Poles. d) Any large increase in foreign populn increases risk of disorder - anti-semitism is just below the surface.

P.M. I’m concerned with Poles, not Jews. Actually we had a v. small J. popn cpd withother countries. I’m concerned only with Poles - &amp; Poles who have really fought. We have a sacred duty to them. They are not without their troubles: &amp; they have bn. led on by pledges &amp; promises of ours. S/S Air. Behaviour of Poles: v. good reputation in Scotland, in spite of being R.C.’s. Remember they came to our aid in B/Britain; &amp; their pilots were then an indispensable re-inforcement. Not much we can do for them. If in the last resort we can do nothg. else, surely let us do this for them. The claims of the Teutonic Jews are not to be compared with them. L/P. Matter of definition: to keep it to the real fighting men. M/L. Cdn’t we study this a) on definition b) with Doms. how that number can be absorbed. Some remain in Army/Occupn : some go to France. Practical approach. J.A. Make service in B. Forces a ground for naty: but defn needed. Doms. O.K.
