100 not accounted for, believed scuttled. { Coastal Command to be reduced from 80 to 5 squadrons. Personnel { re-allotted. { Liberators to transport: others to rescue &amp; training. { C.A.S. to submit to P.M. rept on redn &amp; re-allocn of C. Command. Convoy in N. Atlantic suspended 29/5. B. Fleet in Pacific w’drawn to refit in Australia. Syria. O.S. Fr. Amb. has said orders given to stop Jeanne d’Arc.(?) – tho’ told by de G. not to say so. P.M. Asked C.O.S. to consider what we cd. best do to stop her. C.N.S. Anson &amp; 2 cruisers are in position to stop her. Fear it wd. be necessary to sink her. P.M. Loud-spker. to call on crew to desist. B.B. Rptd. stopped at Bizerta.

P.M. Rely on C.O.S. to stop her by means least likely to cause bloodshed. Short of sinking the ship.

Military. C.I.G.S. Burma. Nothing v. fresh. Monsoon. Mopping up. 15.000 – at 200 p. diem. Betwn. Irrawaddy &amp; Sittang river. Pushing out eastwds. China. Jap w’drawals (due prs. to c. movemt. of R. divisions) threaten their commns to S. China. Access by sea is precarious. Pacific. Okinawa. N. of island cleared easily: heavy opposn in South. Now overcome: rapid advance. From now on shd. clear rest of island quickly. [Enter M/W.T.

2. Arabia: Masirah Island. P.M. Mistake to mar symmetry of our policy – take nothg. L.S.A. Does this apply to small desert island – aircraft carrier. R.K.L. Only leasing: no pressure if reluctant. P.M. Discuss at 3 Power Mtg – view on leasing. H.M. Freely negotiated lease – no transfer of sovereignty – comp. to our leases to U.S. U.S. are acquiring airfield in Saudi Arabia on similar terms. We’ve spent much on it. P.M. Then you must establ. diffce betwn. lease &amp; acquisition What do U.S. think? R.K.L. Must we do it now? 6 mos. later wd. do. H.M. The more money you spend – traffic increasg. – more we have to gain. Easier to do it now. P.M. Sound State Dpt. – make sure it doesn’t compromise our attitude on “no territorial claims” – see what they feel about freely negotiated leases. R.K.L. Got it in our possession between now &amp; Jap war. Some risk even in approaching U.S. at present. H.M. Link it up with U.S. negotiations in S. Arabia. As they are doing this, we presume no objn to our doing this. Proposed. { F.O. to make quiet enquiries. { F.O. &amp; Air Miny to consult – free to bring up in a month. R.K.L. U.S.A.A.F. have similar arrangemt. there – tho’ they have spent less. Dangerous to consult U.S. lest they jump in first.

O.S. Bad moment because diffy. with Fr. – it breaches our agreemt. with them. Agreed. { Postpone entirely (w’out enquiry) until after 3 Power Mtg. { Again in 2 months.

3. Shipping for Fleet Train.

Train now = 800.000 odd. Now want it raised to 1.100.000 t. odds.

diminished.

This cuts into life of countrymen at home.

L. When these ships go to R.N., they are gone for rest of war. And some

Canada: only 2 more of those to come. Diff to find others.

B.B. Modest requirements in this paper are essential. P.M. 230.00 t. more allowed to Admy. in April, on undertakg. to replace. This makes it too expensive to wage war in F/East. Out of propn to our modest force. 29.9 m. tons for ’45 import p’mme. We got only 12 m. in first half. Can’t get more than 16 m. in second half. Pre-war 54 m. The ships servg. import p’mme must be increased not B.B. These requirements are much less than Admiral demanded. C.N.S. They have now had to go back to Sydney to replenish. V. small deficits wd. result. M/W.T. 85 sailing p. month short – not v. small. Ch. = 7 m. tons of imports. But provided for no more than 16 m. imports because supply promised no more. If now supplies increased we shd. be short of ships. Of 230.000 t. replacemt. promised we’ve had only 40.000 t. B.B. Ques. is wtr. you want to go on fighting in Pacific. W’out this, we can’t. C.N.S. Demands (less 15 ships) were known last Dec. year. P.M. Jap campaign can’t be run w’out thrift – regard for civil consequences. x/ You may have to accept some restn on operations. are special ships – new &amp; oil-burning. Earlier we cd. draw from They wd. have to be surrendered at once. B.B. We have incorporated in this demand all the high requirements of S.E.A.C. L. Postpone decn until we know C.O.S. other demands for S.E.A.C. P.M. Meet it fr. over 3 m. tons on Admy a/c?

C.N.S. They are under voyage charter. intermittent. Give us our choice out of those ships &amp; we will accept that. i.e. meet our

requirement out of that.

2.5 m. of this is not intermittent: permanently workg. for Admy.

L. Want to be sure of my quid pro quo. Not so easy. e.g. we cdn’t give refrigerated ships. W. confirmed. Agreed. At end of European war, we must face release of Allied Ships – under U.M.A. agreemt. we shan’t get same value from them. P.M. First Lord, M/W.T. shd. meet under chairmanship of J.A. Power to invite other Ministers concerned. Power to settle. Don’t accept Admy word operationally necessary as decisive – c.f. x/ above. { Exeunt C.O.S. { Enter Swinton: Ch. Whip 4. Prestwick Airport. Freedoms 1 and 2: have to designate an airfield for these.

thereafter No. 2.

Statement proposed will lose many seats in W. Scotland.

R. Suppl. Est. to-morrow. Depth/feeling in Scotl. re Prestwick. S. intends no special posn for P’wick. S. Other Sc. airports – no disagreemt. P.M. Tough attitude of U.S. – due to disapptmt over Chicago. Need for agreement with Truman to ride it a bit easier. Prestwick. Sc. is hurt because hopes of great Transatlantic airport dashed. S. We propose a) to make Prestwick (£5-6 M for 2 runways to make it) effective. We propose to designate it: so tht. any line wh. wishes will have right to land there as at designated airport. We have also excluded any line running out of Prestwick for inland. W’in U.K. operator desiring to run fr. P’wick wd. be able to apply to Tribunal. L.P.S. Shd. not exclude Sc. co. from rights available to rlway co. You damage civil av. in Scotland. R. £3 M spent already – must be in v. good shape. They don’t expect it to take place of Heath Row – but until that is ready they think it shd. be the No. 1. airport – not Bournemouth. And Not concerned over inland traffic. Shdn’t be ordered to land at B’mouth. P.M. Want re-assuring statement made.

S. Prestwick will be designated. L.P.S. That won’t be enough – cover internal also because Sc. civil aviation. S. Any pre-war operator can start on pre-war route.

That covers Gander Dower. Not Macintyre who has never run an

airport. Prestwick &amp; Transatlantic. Wd. this do? Can’t compel foreigner to land where he doesn’t wish to. When P. has bn. designated as airport for all purposes: so far as concerns B. services you require them until Heath Row is ready to make a stop there: But wrong to prevent them going on to Herne (nearer Ldn.). Kind of aircraft B.O.A.C. will be using for early years can use Prestwick. P.M. S. &amp; R. to consider with M/W.T. and L.P.S. under Chairmanship of O.L. what statement can be made. Perkins to attend] } } Agreed R. Prepared to accept x/. Mtg. to be held to-morrow a.m. to } A. settle the formula &amp; submit to P.M. by luncheon. } L.P.S. There remains the inland ques. R. They are satisfied up to a point. S. Macintyre cd. apply to Tribunal for leave to run services fr. P’wick to any place inland. Liberty to operate abroad wd. breach the whole plan for regulating internatl air transport. L. Agree wd. cut into all our other plans. O.L. Can’t re-open the whole issue before to-morrow. Ch. Whip. Sc. candidate cdn’t agree tht. all rights to expand be limited to English rlways. L. Rlways only 35%. B.B. Sc. will be cut out of all development.

P.M. Plays into hands of Sc. Home Rulers. Give Sc. more to make up for Engl. greater share in rlways. S. Say – Sc. must have a share in the company. That wd. work. But to give B/European Corpn right to any operator wd. cut across the whole scheme. Open competition, wh. is involved, wd. wreck all our work up to date.

L.P.S. a) Chicago leaves us free to do what we like with out own. b) Financial interest in the one co. doesn’t meet the wish to expand in free enterprise. Give them 1/8th - &amp; freedom to operate. P.M. ? Say – Sc. is intended to have her proper share in development of civil aviation: that is our intention in principle: arrangemt. is matter of detail.

Perkins to attend the Mtg. [Enter G. Lloyd

O.L. Cd. they run 1/8th of traffic in competn? S. They wd. then cut right into the paying routes &amp; do no other. O.L. Allot them routes. e.g. if Norway was 1/8th give them that. P.M. “Share wh. Sc. is to have in c. avn requires detailed considn, wh. is { being given. { guiding princ. will be tht. share will not be inferior to that of England. { tho’ expressed in difft. way.” Agreed Formula on these lines to be considered at to-morrow’s mtg. B S. M/W.T. shd. be consulted. If you mean these people are to be free to operate at will on any route, our scheme wd. be bust &amp; the Co. wd. chuck hands in. If you mean specified route for Scots that wd. be practicable: we wd. have to exclude it fr. the Co. Agreed as at A &amp; B. Exit Swinton. 5. Exit Permits for Members of Parliament. H.O. Relax restn now qua M.P.’s. More genl. relaxation can come fairly soon. P.M. No additional facilities. H.O. No. Proposal approved. R.K.L. P.Q. on Rhys Davies. to-morrow. P.M. Say “genl. ques. has bn. reviewed &amp; announemt. will be made by H.O.”.

6. Polling in Certain Constituencies. H.O. a) 19th July in some cases – can be done. Agreed: Yes Ch. Whip. W.O. facilitate circuses. P.M. We must have our own. H.O. b) the staggered towns, who ask for 2 polling days. Agreed: No. c) Govt. advice about staggering. Against that, can’t intervene. Agreed: No. d) Deletions from list. Ch. Whip consultg. so tht. Members can be consulted. Ch. Whip. Not much time to do it all. H.O. If clear it isn’t wanted, may I have authy to delete. Agreed: Yes. 7. Political Activities of Members of H.M. Forces. P.M. Put a) in Memo. Agreed. On b) e.g. M.P.’s who went back to Parlt. &amp; those serving at announcement.

P.J. Restrict to members in this war: not those entitled to wear uniform fr. last war. On d) Comm. in pl. clothes holds mtg. nr. own barracks where known &amp; blackguards his offer. P.M. Agreed that wdn’t do. Wd it pay us? Ch. Whip. Who are serving or have served in this war. (b) agreed, subject to this change. H.M. Is (c) enforceable, qua men. Diffce betwn. tempy &amp; man servg. 7 + 5 is tenuous. O.L. Can you distinguish?

P.J. Delete (d), and no diffy. arises. Repeated point on communists. R.S.H. If you allow this, what about tempy civil servants? They’ve bn. instructed that they can’t. I have thousands. J.A. Clear distinction – no misunderstandg. P.J. Will be said to favour the Officer because men have no plain clothes.

R.A.B. Stand on (c) - because of diffy. of distinguishing betwn (c) &amp; (d).

R.K.L. Agreed re (c) &amp; (d).

Misgivings on (b). Prejudice v. Army in politics. Most on our side. H.M. The nos. are about even. R.K.L. withdrew his point. B.B. The Admirals are opposed to (b). } But neither } Minister pressed H.M. So are the Air Marshals. } the point. On (c) &amp; (d) P.M. I wd. drop (c), if told it’s difficult to distinguish. O.S. Meaning of “intervening”. You can’t stop a soldier asking a question. As you can’t enforce that, omit it. P.J. Do these rules apply abroad?

P.J. They can now attend mtgs.

P.M. No Make (c) apply to all, temporary &amp; permanent. P.M. W. { O.S., M/L. to meet to-morrow &amp; recommend solution on c) &amp; d).

{ Ch. Whip &amp; one Service Minister (Macmillan). Agreed.
