C.M. 50(45). 6th November, 1945 at 4.30 p.m. 1. Washington Discussions. Financial Questions and Commercial Policy. H.D. Bretton Woods. Nothing in this which affects state trading etc. Narrower than supposed. Wd require us to do 3 things a) secure stable exchange rate b) .. relaxn of .. restns qua current paymts. c) .. convertibility of currency. Of these, a) is to our advantage. Competitive devaluation of foreign currencies was greatest handicap to our export trade in inter-war years. Subject to condition: that we can avoid being dragged down by deflationary depression of other currencies. For this, escape clauses are provided. We shd. have to declare our rate of exchange v. dollars &amp; gold. We can change by 10% either way uni-laterally. Beyond 10% also, if Gov. Body of Fund are satisf. change needed to correct fundamental disequilibrium. Further, any member can w’draw at any time w’out leave or notice. Many safeguards, therefore. Obligations, especially under b) and c), won’t operate until after transitional period wh. mustn’t be too short. If 5 years, this wd. do. Interpretative declaration. Wd. be safe without it. But cautious to safeguard a) our emplt. policy b) transition: period is at our option. Read out text from “a)” to (b). J. “Necessary” for emplt. policy. Means “necessary” in judgment of Gov. Body. H.D. But if you don’t like their decision you can w’draw from the Fund. A.B. Not relevant tht. U.S. have put in similar interpretative Decln. They have nothg. to fear. R.S.C. But U.S. will find it diff. to stop others from barring her imports. H.D. My point was merely tht. U.S., having put theirs in, can’t object to ours. A.B. Criticisms – a) we are abandoning Sterling area system. Safeguards really destroy B.W. Agreemt. And, havg. meanwhile destroyed Sterling area, we shall be left with neither. E.Sh. Sorry to see these separated into w’tight compartments. Can’t discuss B.W. w’out refce to commercial policy.

We begin fr. the point that we must borrow from U.S. But we haven’t been told yet why, we need to borrow. H.D. In my memo. of August. £1.00 m. over 3 years: to buy the imports we must have. B. Woods. Talk with J.A. &amp; Keynes: K. admitted it wd. be better to get Trade agreemt. before B. Woods. Tho’ borrower in diffies, so often is the lender. What wd. happen in U.S. if we had to tighten our belt. Ball not entirely at U.S. feet, since the debtors are essential to U.S. prosperity. We can therefore strike hard bargain. Clear intention of U.S. = break up Sterling group. Let us first be sure of consequences of that. We shall then be entirely in U.S. hands, who can throw resources where they wish. Don’t play into their hands by makg. it condn of borrowing from them (wh. is to their advantage) tht. we shd. accept B. Woods and destroy Imperial Preference. How close is B. Woods to Trade Agreement. What is devaluation for – related to emplt. policy &amp; to trade agreement. Just as much dictation as it was in 1931. B. Woods postulates non- discrimination. We must leave our hands free. Aren’t we too quick to accept this international co-opn idea w’out seeing first what it means. Do you think U.S. will throw their markets open to us? R.S.C. No agreemt. unless they do. E.Sh. Then there won’t be any agreemt. They can be self-sufficient. And for this nebulous offer, we are going to break Sterling Area and discard our power of discrimination. R.S.C. This is clear issue - are we to maintain Isolationist Policy or to follow declared policy of Labour Party? Are we going in for attempt at it. This = all part of a scheme. If one leg breaks, we shall come our of all these schemes. Our policy = to have a shot at this, provided we are safeguarded v. failure. A.V.A. Was ready to agree to that when it was assumed tht. U.S. wd. approach this with reasonable moral attitude. Much opinion tht. U.S. are using financial posn to enable them to break our Imperial position. P.M. Then how do we do this w’out them? A.V.A. They are more dependent on us than they suggest. After 1931 we got on our own feet in 2 years by Imperial trade system. Think we may have to do the same again unless we can get better terms. Don’t yet know what these terms involve. Will they tie a mill stone round our necks for a generation. a) What happens to pre-war

U.S. debt? What is debit value of remanet of L-Lend? Sinking fund &amp; interest will or may be intolerable burden. H.D. On a) no revival &amp; U.S. haven’t asked for it. If they did, we wd. refuse. A.V.A. Then take it out of Budget White Paper. H.D. I’m considering that. On b) all will be wiped out: ½ billion dollars out of this loan will be attributed to that. Final evaluation, includg. those in pipeline, are being estimated in Washington. E.Sh. And then you pay 2% on them. R.S.C. Yes because they are either goods after V.J. Day or goods we intend to divert to civil uses. H.D. L-Lend will be wholly &amp; finally liquidated for this ½ billion dollars. A.B. Think we’re giving far too much for what we are getting. U.S. purpose = liquidate Sterling Area. St. Area canalises trade. Our creditors are anxious to trade with us in order to get our goods. (H.D. Unrequited exports) P.M. Trouble = large sterling balances: they want goods for which we get nothg. in return. H.D. Sterling bloc is somethg. wh. will go on v. strongly if you don’t make this agreemt. with U.S. On contrary, they are v. conscious of the diffy. above, &amp; they will break away. S. Africa will soon want to go out of it. E.B. Started in 1941 – U.S. not in war: no L-Lend. A.G. was then in Chair. After L-Lend started, K. to help invented Bancor. I got them to agree to reservation in Interpr. Decln. Then White invented Unitas. For all these years same arguments all over &amp; over again. I hate idea of getting under U.S. control. But situation I’m faced with is – can you carry thro’ B. people for next 3 years on lower rations. I believe our bluff is called. We can’t ask them to face another 3 years of even tighter living – with industrial unrest. We are in Shylock’s hands. What is lowest price we can get? Wd. risk a higher price w’out strings. But we can’t get rid of the strings. And I believe our negotiators have got the best terms possible. No alternative now but to accept this unless you are ready to demand these further sacrifices from the B. people. That this is the real issue now. 325

P.M. This leads up to Conference. I don’t believe U.S. will reduce their tariffs. A.B. We are to co-operate with U.S. in putting proposals to a Conference. Para. 7 of H.D.’s document. The “proposals” are in Annex C. to R.S.C.’s memo. Worried because a) looks as tho’ we enter it with dangerous proposals many of wh. corresp. to those of Businessmen’s Confce at Chicago next year. Wdn’t mind going in with a free hand. But many countries cdn’t fit in with this 19th Century attitude – implied by U.S. proposals. R.S.C. They issue this document uni-laterally. What they want us to say is we give general support to principles &amp; are ready to join on that basis in March conference. That confce is to see wtr. suff. prospect of tariff reductions to go on to June Confce on total scheme of Trade Agreement. We shd. not run counter to these genl. principles - &amp; shdn’t want to. For every one of them is among our primary objectives as an exporting nation. These are all things wh. we asked for; &amp; have abandoned many things they wanted. P.M. Contact with Doms. throughout. A. They have made it a condition they shd. get quid pro quo. And ready to go ahead on that basis. The Int. Decln in Annex B. makes that clear. I have no misgivings re Doms. attitude. T.W. Our negotiators have bn. amazingly successful. Immense progress during last few months. We can’t go wrong in agreeing to this Conference. P.M. Issues to be faced. a) Are you ready to tell B. people to suffer 3 more years of even worse privations? A.G. Problems clearly put in p.p. of August by Keynes &amp; R.S.C. We have done v. well to get so far. We can’t dictate to U.S. Tho’ their long-term diffies will be greater than ours, they are on velvet to-day. Unless immediate relief by U.S., years of privation for U.K. Take firm decision to-day. C.E. Our diffy = no p.p. seen since we saw mema in August. Any creditor can break a debtor. Only a wise creditor can let him live &amp; make him pay. U.S. is not a wise creditor. We may in the end have to ask our people to stand up to it. But we ought to be able to say tht. it was the creditors &amp; not we who broke up the Confce. We shd. go to the confce &amp; try to make it clear to the U.S. people that they have their duties as creditors. 326

Avoid anythg. wh. makes us subservient to U.S. And if it breaks make it clear that U.S. broke it. As we did for Russia at C.F.M. J.J.L. Ques. wtr. B. people wd. stand more privation. Even more important wd. be loss of all their hopes of international co-opn. U.S. wd. pull out of responsibilities for occupn etc. Moral loss wd. be greater than any economic loss. E.Sh. Para. 7 of H.D.’s memo. But I have reservns on Annex C. E.g. Russia has to be brought in: look at para. on State-trading. No Socialist Govt. cd. accept that. P.M. The words aren’t happy, but are directed to use of State trading to get round tariffs. E.Sh. Look also at words on Subsidies. All right if they aren’t concealed. Concealed State subsidies for shipping in U.S. a) Ask therefore tht. our hands be not tied. b) Ask tht. we look at B. Woods after Trade Agreemt. Wd. be ready to give up b) if you agree to a). R.S.C. The deal wd. then be off. Two months’ work wd. be wasted. All these proposals are our own. State trading – as in telegrams. H.D. When it comes to workg. it out at Confce, we can propose detailed amendmts. We got it agreed tht. State tradg. formula doesn’t exclude long-term contracts with regular [Exit P.M. buyers. Convinced tht. this can be safeguarded by long-term arrangemts. R.S.C. On subsidies – E.B. “Commercial” in the telegram. Put “such” before “commercial”. R.S.C. We cd. easily do that at the Conference. We accept the general principle. E.B. Try &amp; get it altered now. Drop it if they fuss &amp; raise it at Conference. R.S.C. Soviet case is covered by another clause relatg. to States having complete monopoly of foreign trade. A.B. Can’t agree this is good agreement. Think it is a bad one. And people will so regard it. Accept F.O. word that alternative is to bite on the iron: but don’t know how much. Believe we have under-estimated our own strength &amp; over-estimated U.S. strength. 327

E.B. Assured we can’t get thro’ w’out passing to even lower rations for 2 years. E.Sh. I wd. rather face that than accept this position. For U.S. won’t be able to co-operate. H.D. What it wd. involve. To maintain existg. p’mme of consumption &amp; production. 100 needed fr. U.S. in 1946 alone. With no imports from U.S. – bread &amp; potato alone wd. be maintained. redn in fats: no cheese increase: no dried eggs or tinned meat: 15% redn in meat imported: redn in maize, effect on livestock: 50% .. .. sugar: 40% in ply wood: cotton: 80% redn in tobacco. No export of steel products. W’in Ty. I have long refused to believe we are so dependent. And these facts produced because of my reluctance. Easy to make a Dunkirk speech. Diff. matter to face those facts. We really can’t face it. E.Sh. What will U.S. do with these goods. H.D. They won’t give us them on L.-Lend. E.Sh. U.S. will be forced to come to terms with us. Believe we cd. force U.S. into it. U.S. want to know how they will dispose of their products. Let us have the loan, but don’t let us tie our hands. H.M. These arguments have bn. tried on U.S. ad nauseam w’out success. Don’t believe U.S. will give way. They will insist on business transaction. Posn is worse than 2 years’ rationing. We have to pay for pipe-line LL. We must have raw materials. We must get dollars in order to deal with St. Area., who are restive. Shall we have an easier job in getting the money fr. St. Area vice U.S. A.V.A. Quoted K. memo. Also penultimate para. of memo. (29). What about monthly overdraft instead. H.D. K. wrote that before he went out. Now he has produced the waiver, &amp; wd. say that met his own memo. Monthly overdraft – we have considered already. We tried that on K. in Altern. B. The answer is that this isn’t a possible starter now. A.B. Have we bn. negotiating with best people. What about a higher level? Truman. R.S.C. On 12/ll he proposes to commend this plan. That is his view.

328

E.B. I tried all this on Byrnes, includg. the overdraft. His answer was: Congress Cttee &amp; we cdn’t carry it. A.B. There will be trouble over interpn of Annex C. R.S.C. We consider Annex C. highly advantageous apart altogether from the loan. J. Think we are being black-mailed. Prob. we shd. give way to black-mailer. But don’t think it’s a satisfy. bargain. Is it poss. to make B. Woods condl on Trade Agreement – conclusion not opening. H.D. Look at B. Woods on basis of Int. Decln. That Decln hasn’t got to be settled to-night. Can we improve on it? R.S.C. If we don’t get a satisf. Trade Agreemt., we can always come out of B. Woods. Indeed, everyone wd. come out. H.D. U.S. attach gt. Party prestige value to B. Woods. They have adopted it. Want others to do so. Must take a/c of their attitude H.M. Remember Art 7 was our promise in return for L-Lend. H.D. B. Woods must be ratified by 31/12/45. No use trying to link it with Conference not mtg. until June. J. Interp. Decln. Put legal points on both parts. H.D. My purpose is clear. If Ty. words don’t express it, let legal pundits have another shot at it. J. Make it clear &amp; U.S. won’t agree. H.D. They won’t be asked to. The technique is conditional acceptance – accept if Gov. Body agrees to interpretation. I will continue, with others, to try to improve this drafting. P.L. Don’t think loan is v. satisfactory. Hope we may get no worse terms. But no other solution is better: indeed far worse. We really can’t go to the world &amp; say we rejected the only scheme wh. cd. be hatched for finance &amp; trade agreement. Same on B Woods. We can’t reject the only internatl agreement which is in sight. H.M. Accept these recommns as the best we can obtain – is that generally agreed? E.Sh. V. unhappy on Trade Agreement. Must “reserve my position.” A.B. Took same view.

329

H.M. Don’t “reserve yr. posn”. Your doubts will be recorded. A.V.A. I too feel uneasy. Even now, negotiators mayn’t get these terms. The Cabinet shd. have chance to resume discn if worse terms offered. A.B. Speeches. Don’t say this is a good agreement. E.B. Say nothing to make our pol. relations with U.S. any worse. H.M. We at Cabinet shall have to consider what is to be said. R.S.C. Statement after Ques (by me) on 12/11. to explain commercial side. H.M. May be necessary to have statement on Financial side too. Cab. must consider how to handle this when settlement is reached. E.B. Want this considered separately, and at leisure. Agreed: meet again before anything decided to be said. 330
