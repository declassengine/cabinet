C.M. 2(46). 3rd January, 1946.

1. Mr Peter Fraser. P.M. Welcome to Fraser. P.F. Thanked. Congrats. to C.O.S. &amp; welcome to Tedder.

2. Situation in Germany.

Welcome to M.

M. Last summer Control Commn establd – going v. well now, thanks to Control Office wh. was necessary. Situation a) material. Starvation &amp; disease. 1500 cal. over-all: bare minimum. Can honour ration provided we get wheat asked for. W’out that wd. go down to 900 = 1/3rd of U.K. This wd. mean not only starvation but disease. We can now handle disease – main fear wd. be outbrk. of virulent ‘flu. And risk not of handling there but comg. over here. Traffic 10.000 p. wk. Now considerg. how we cd. insulate it. We shall win battle of winter if we get the wheat. b) human. 23m. G. in B. Zone. Our troubles with them will come: for (i) next yr. signs of recovery &amp; they’ll see won’t benefit them. Machinery removed. (ii) w’spread unemplt. because of our econ. policy. (iii) demobd 3 m. G. fightg. men in our Zone (iv) removed Nazis fr. office, who are good organisers – idle with field for work. Trouble already in U.S. Zone. Need therefore a) not to run down overmuch B. strength in Germany. Recommns made to W.O. b) care in increasg. tempo of T.U.’s &amp; pol. parties. Seeds sown: let them grow naturally. Need for right sort of leaders First phase of our work over. Re-groupg. for next – forms (i) In C.C. we have 14 subordinates: lack therefore of co-ordinn: no-one has time for constve thinkg. Therefore re-groupg. into Sub- Commns. e.g. Transport, Econom., &amp; Repns under single man with time to travel &amp; think. (ii) Mil. Govt. to give way to civil. I now govern thro’ Corps Comms. Must prepare for Govt. by G. supervised by us. First stage was fusion of C.C. &amp; Mil Govt. Next = replace Genls. with Reg.Commns.:target date ¼. (iii) Need for change of heart in G. people. Must get down to youth – 7 – 9’s. Once thght. of Boy Scouts etc. Now believe tht. wd. raise suspicion in Allied Council in Berlin. Going now for Boys Clubs instead, with help of Fedn we are going for big drive to get at the youth. (iv) Need for agreed level of G. industry. Can’t get that now – everyone is so keen on Repns. Want broad outline of target 434

5 years hence. Work that out: &amp; then everything else is available for repns. That is now biggest problem of all. Shan’t, w’out it, get repns fixed by Feb. date. P.M. Girls as well as boys?

M. On b) policy = not to be employers of labour or in Govt. work.

M. Yes. Later on may need specialise on girls. P.M. Views of U.S. – are they workg. in line with us? M. Yes, in the main – not on finance. Went v. us unexpectedly on G. Forces in B. Zone – now in line again. Fr. also generally in accord save for “single unit”. H.D. Food: rpts. of plenty in country areas. Is enough done a) to collect or b) to shift the young to rural plenty. M. In country areas people live 100%. Preventg. outrush into country because no-one shd. live 100% in G. Forbidden B. from buying any food. Transport is diffy. Cd. move more. E.Sh. a) On econ. plan – w’out agreemt. with R. cd. you have plan for B. Zone. b) Idle Nazi’s – wd. it be wiser to get them to work? believe they wd. be safer at work. On a) we shd. brk. up quadripartite Govt. &amp; go into Zones. Cd.

Teachg. staff screened. But little influence over students.

A. D.p.’s

be done. A. Youth – can we get right teachers? M. Yes, got them. Books were a delay. Most dangerous in edn = Universities. 4.000 in each of 6 Univs. – ex-soldiers: risk of plots being hatched there. I’m plantg. students &amp; also arranging snap raids. M. Polish – reluctance to go in winter. D.p. camps v. comfortable &amp; the men refuse to work. Not good. Believe we shd. adopt policy that by ¼ every d.p. must declare wtr. he will return &amp; if not he must go elsewhere to named countries. And after ¼ “no work, no food”. E.B. For Poles I want to write off those unwillg. to return – vice persuadg. them to go. i.e. contractg. out vice in. Those going back are being treated fairly.

435

E.B. Cd. M. have off - record talk with Press – Editors as well as

M. We have had some who’ve gone &amp; retd. That makes others reluctant to go. J. Attitude to atrocities. M. No shame – done by Nazi’s - &amp; you can’t find any to-day. That = why we must tackle the children. R.S.C. x/ G. leaders. Have we combed out people here? M. Up to date I’ve bn. reluctant to import fr. outside – esp. puttg. them on top. Need for gt. care. Our popn is increasing – fr. east. We have receptn arrangemts., but we can’t prevent return to own homes to live in cellars. P.F. Our impn = B Zone is being admind with greater understandg. than other 3. Coal – need for miners to have enough. A.B. What is real objn to x/. M. None, if we cd. be sure they are right types for present problem. J.B.H. Regular machinery for screening thro’ M. &amp; Control Office. G.A.I. Was the visit of B. T.U. Delegn useful. M. Yes, to us: &amp; prob. to Germans. J.B.H. They were pleased with what they saw. G.A.I. Cd. the rept be publsd? J.B.H. Will circulate to Cab. R.S.C. Publ. also as W. Paper. Dipl. Corresp. _ &amp; explain our problems. F.O. &amp; Control Office to arrange. M. shd. see rpts. of allegns made by R. at Moscow re B. mil authies in G. &amp; A. A.B. Health Mission deprecated absence of central Health Dpt. Can anythg. be done? M. I agree – but can’t get over Fr. objns. 436

N.B. Transport. How far = coal: lorries: petrol. Wd. more coal for G. use improve it? M. Due mainly to a) lack and bad repair of rollg. stock on rlways. b) lack of petrol. Much G. transport off the roads because I can’t supply B. petrol or to open synthetic plants in G. Wd. take 3 months. R. have opened up one. x/ J.B.H. Potsdam incl. this as war potential. R. excuse = temporary. Ours wd. be too. Agreed: Cab. to reconsider x/ and y/. P.M. Repair of war damage? M. Doing it well: concentratg. on housing. P.M. Employ Nazis on this? M. Are doing, to some extent. T.W. G. agriculture? M. Harvest 70% overall – heavy rain, &amp; battle interf. with spring sowg. Next year cause will be shortage of fertiliser due to closing of ammonia plant. E.B. Shd. we also re-consider re-opening ammonia plant? y/

J.B.H. Plan incldg. x/ and y/ recently tabled at Allied Council in Berlin. [Exit Montgomery &amp; Fraser. 3. Entrances to Baltic.

Re-considered: advantage in gettg. it clear this = free waterway.

E.B. As in memo. Attentn drawn to F.D.R. statemt. at Tehran on Kiel Canal – refused to discuss because undertaken not to consider G. problems at Moscow mtg. Thght S. was seekg. base in Skagerak. Assured me he wasn’t. For useful in later discns re Straits. C.N.S. No obstacles to free passage of any type of ship.

Riparian states weakness shd. ensure tht. this state continues.

Agree therefore with E.B.’s paper. R.S.C. Risk of greater Power gettg. control. C.A.S. Any Power wh. conquered Denmark cd. control. E.B. Firm decln wd. be best guarantee.

437

A.V.A. No real threat save fr. resurgent Germany or us. We have no designs &amp; we are going to control G. But R. wd. prs. like to get in themselves. E.B. Wd. like to discuss with B. &amp; V. when they are here for U.N.O. Such a statement wd. help fr. angle of future discns re other waterways.

[Enter Barnes.

4. Disposal of German Merchant Fleet.

Barnes. Congrats. to B. members of Commn. We got most of G. ships and have bn. usg. them. Condns therefore are v. import. to us. Stress para. 6 – terms of commn to be agreed with F.O. &amp; Admy. Annex I. para 6. Sov. Govt. wd. like these referred back to Commn. I recommend settlement thro’ dipl. channel. Annex II. B. Paras. ticked can be accepted w’out reservations. Urge tht. Rpt. be accepted with these reservns – quickly, for Sov. Govt. have already accepted. C.A.S. We agree with memo. – incldg. reservations. T.W. On fishing fleet – can we be kept in touch. E.Sh. What was basis of allocation? Equity or need? U.S. has too much. E.B. At Potsdam we agreed to division by 2/3rds – R. lookg. after Poland, and B. and U.S. to look after other small Powers. B. &amp; U.S. have now to discuss disposal of those to smaller Powers. Sov. Govt. have accepted, save for para. 14. At Moscow they pressed me for statement, which I gave (after consultn with Dpts.) H.D. Finance. Govt, wh. has spent money on repairs is to be re-couped by countries receivg. Barnes. Not if we’ve bn. usg. ship for own purposes. H.D. Country B. can counter-claim for A.’s use of ship before transfer. Barnes. Covered by terms of our reservation. H.D. Ask for closer contact with Ty. in workg. this out. J.B.H. P.6., para. 7: no repns a/c betwn. us &amp; Russia. Our repair bill will exceed compensn for use bill - &amp; no way of recovering from R. Suggest further discn betwn. Dpts. 438

B. Para. 7: para. to wh. we attach reservation. H.D. Is it clear we don’t pay for use until settlement for repairs? B. Yes. J.B.H. Para. 14. Wd. like Control Office added. B. Will consider – J.B.H. Para. 6 of covering memo.

B. Agree to add to para. 6. i.e. consultn - Agreed. A.B. Cl. 7 of Agreement – last para. but one. When this has bn. done repair facilities are to be radically reduced. P.M. Raise this later – on G. war potential. Agreed. [Exit Barnes: C.O.S.: N.B.: Hynd. 5. Elections in Greece. E.B. As in memo. R.S.C. Registers – will there be supervision on re-opening of registers. Believe any amount of corruption – plural voting. E.B. Never heard of this. Windle expects to be able to check &amp; have corrected. A. V. comprehensive &amp; costly machinery. N.Z. &amp; S.Af have agreed: Austr. will: Canada won’t: send observers. Smuts threateng. to back out – but expect to keep him in. Agreed.

6. Migration. A. As in memo. C.O.S. say tht. if forced to give a figure they wd. give too high a one. C/E. has therefore agreed. H.D. Have agreed: but v. dissatisfied with C.O.S. attitude. Want to keep up pressure on the C.O.S., as &amp; when possible. Agreed – as in memo. 439

7. Gas shortage in London.

A.B. Disturbed re gas in Ldn. w. ref. to outbrk. of mild ‘flu. E.Sh. Labour shortage is the cause. Unskilled workers – wages unattractive – T.U.’s don’t like extended use of troops. A.B. Public say – enough labour all thro’ war.

E.Sh. There was redn in pressure durg. war. Labour was directed durg. war. G.A.I. Review completed this wk. – will use Labour Supply Offrs. &amp; Factory Dpt. to seek improved condns. It’s not wages.
