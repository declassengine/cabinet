W.M. 31(45). 15th March, 1945. Food Supplies. O.L. Ben Smith – telegram coming – refrain from mentioning names of Mission to W’ton until that is received. P.M. Ch. doesn’t want to go because dissents from views of others on claims of libd areas. O.L. Not a good negotiating point to cut down estimates of requirements: i.e. don’t under-rate the crisis. Ch. Someone will say the figures are too high - &amp; say why support them. I believe solution wd. be to cut Russia, military &amp; lib. areas. O.L. Shaef figures not immune from criticism – by us or others. P.M. Doubtful: U.S. may regret their interest in Europe if we put the call on them too high. Don’t say only a small reduction requ d . But don’t put the need too high. Ch. I wd. say “Officials proposed cut consumpt n 1 m. tons. 100.000 t. fr. stocks. { B. Cut from stocks. Meat { 1.4m. deficit. 600.000 mil. 600.000 l. areas. 550.000 Russia. Can’t say why military want increases in last year of war. P.M. Why do we want 200.000 t. more for B. Troops? O.L. Combined Ch. of Staff. Ch. Lib. areas demand 50.000 t.p. month. 11 oz p. wk for 32 m. people. That is our ration. Don’t believe they need more than 200.000 +. Then cut 200.000 t. off Russians. Line therefore to show tht. if they will cut the 1 m. tons we can bridge the gap remaining. O.L. These are negotiating points. But want to see how it works out before we suggest no crisis. Ch. The main objective must be to get U.S. Govt. to accept their officials’ proposal for 1 m. cut in meat. O.L. Our main case is a deficit (importing) area can’t contribute save from stocks except by importing the same amount later to replace.

Housing. W. Doubted wtr H/C. was fully alive to a) organisation b) programme. Thought it might be helpful to put out W. Paper in advance – as for debate on military organisation of Defence Office. Draft hastily prepared: but Ministers agree – in principle on the facts (M/W. &amp; Health Ministers agreed). Ques. for Cabinet is political wisdom of publishing. Want to clarify certain paras., e.g. those on site. M/Ag. And para. 51. P.M. L.a.’s cause of all the delay. And in devastated areas the task is beyond their powers. M/H. Para. 56 shows results on plans. M/W. Temp. sites are more diff. M/H. 55.000 appd – Act law only last Oct. H.O. First ques. is expediency. F.O. Depends on the Paper. P.M. In principle it’s a good idea: saves time of Govt. spokesman. Did that on M/Defence – to avoid long description. M/H. Wd. be a great help. L.P. Wd. stop nonsense being talked. Thought it useful. W.W. Recent procedure: debate on open lines – focus discussion of project. L.P. This is a different W. Paper. Not a project. F.O. Interest will centre on p.3. Is it convincing? O.L. This will focus criticism on the division of responsibility. M/H. Cut out T.C.P.: no conflict betwn E &amp; Scott. Thus 4 reduced to 2. M/L. Set it out: Health Dept. represents consumer. M/W. The Supply Dpt.

BB. Is that the situation. M/W. No: Army doesn’t make any of its own guns. M/L. The Health Dpt. in presenting its demand is in same position as W.O. in indenting on M/Supply. Essential to get this relationship. O.L. But inform H/C. of present position will stimulate demand for that change. P.M. will risk = L.G.B. M/H. But in 20 years since L.G.B. l.a.’s have learned to build houses. L.P. Supply is a false parallel. The Health Dpt. is dealing with a whole range of l.a.’s etc. Can’t get far on consumer/producer analogy. M/H. M/W – can buy. F.O. This description will provoke sugg ns of alternatives. They have no alternative. Save catch-cry of “single Minister”. J.A. x/ But para. 11 is unfortunate. Don’t boast of no. of Dpts. M.A.P. Distinguish between the 2. M/H. You can’t do it too sharply because one shades into another. B.B. This paper will only cause trouble – cf. para. 12 Re-draft to play down the no. of Ministers. E.g. Health Ministers are one, not two, Ministers. P.M. Paras. 11 – 16. - impression of muddle. H.O. a) Cd. be presented better. b) Explain why this is so. Inevit bly mobn of natl. resources for gt. bldg. programme involves Various Ministers. Main resp. for policy = Health Ministers. They draw on the services of others e.g. M/W., M/S., B/T., M/L. – for difft reasons. T.J. Single Ministry – will enrage l.a.’s Give M/W. power to order houses (prefabd) tempy. prefab. parts of perm. houses. But single Miny will produce no more houses &amp; merely

upset l.a.’s. M/H. a) Single Minister cdn’t apply to Scotland. b) top priority for some houses this summer. – as for Mulberry. M/W. On organisation. No ques. of displacing l.a.’s. What wd. be helpful wd. be during the 2 yrs. to treat constn of prefab. Perms on same basis as tempy prefabs. Same case for central ordering, prodn &amp; distn. L.A. wd. have to buy them. Am bringing l.a.’s in on design. W. Agree with M/W. on this. Must shake l.a.’s out of having only traditional methods. B.B. Leeds &amp; Lpl. have led the world. M/W. Some l.a.’s are pioneering: but only the few leading l.a.’s. M/H. No dispute with M/W. Disagree with W: Govt. haven’t yet shown them the new types. One qualifn to M/W. Don’t force l.a. to buy. Let l.a.’s buy from the contractor. Govt. giving only an over-riding order. M/L. Point to be raised in H/C. = when will M/W. show to l.a.’s what they can buy in the way of prefab. perms. What is the answer to that? P.M. said this was to be a military operation. But no orders given to those who will have to carry out the work. P.3. of draft: reduce to one para. M/W. Prefab. perm. - treat same as prefab. temp. Present to l.a.’s range of types &amp; methods. A list of prob. starters has bn. put to Burt Cttee: who have selected the 12 best. I’m now bldg 50 houses of each. Prototypes are already available: the 50’s are to see what the costs &amp; man/hours will be. M/H. Premature to promise perm. prefabs. Not certain it will prove practicable. The Orlit ran into snags. To-morrow seeing architects for first time. Not yet sure enough of perm. prefabs. to say we will be universal provider. Agree: M/W. shd. have power to order, produce &amp; distribute. The l.a.’s shd be invited to see them &amp; given chance to order. Govt. getting the prodn by an over-riding order [ ……….. Out for 5 minutes ……….]

P.M. Enlistment of RAC. for civilian flying squads for erecting prefabs. cf. the organisation for post-raid help &amp; repairs. L.a.’s cdn’t stop that. M/H. That C.D. organisation was done by l.a.’s. P.M. The hybrid prefab. perm is new to me. How do they work? Where will the parts be stored? T.J. Essence = can M/W. be authd to order prefab. parts for perm. houses. H.O. Speed &amp; cost. To be covered in Paper or speeches. a) Steps to make bldg. industry efficient &amp; up-to-date. b) Bulk purchase of components. Govt. pool. Trade channels rationalised? Why not do it on munitions prodn lines? Use R.O.F.s? c) Price control. Measures to beat price rings. d) Estimated costs of bldg. e) Informn to public about licensing system: &amp; arrangements for self-help. W. See para. 40 – for (b). For the rest, this wasn’t intended to take the place of Minister’s speeches. M/W. What was lackg. until last H. Cttee was decision tht. priority shd. be given to methods realising economics in constn . [Always have had authy to do bulk purchase to extent necessary.] This will enable us to turn the heat on to force some unusual constn - labour-saving methods. J.A. x/ Para 11 onwards. Begin: 2 Ministries with primary responsibility. The Health Dpt. &amp; the M/W. Their functions do not clash. Then explain their respect. functions. Add little about other Dpts. M/H. co-ordinates demand. M/W. functions are in the field of supply. P.M. And 3 types of house. Perm = M/H. Other two = M/W. For prefab. temps., at cost of State, we have to pay more for speed. M/L. Factory work may save 6 months on the dole. P.M. In explaining the policy, get people the sense of design. Cr. Is it necessary to have the paras. on organisation at all. The House will be diverted into talking of it. L.P. They will talk anyway. Advantages = have this stated.

M/L. Put it shortly – at end vice beginning. } } Agreed. P.M. Wd. like to see how good &amp; terse it is – first. } Ch. Whip. Date. P.M. Wd. Tuesday do? Agreed: try for Monday. Ministers to send other suggns to W., who will settle with Health Ministers &amp; M/Works. W. Who will present? a) Three housing Ministers or b) M/Reconstn. P.M. a) makg. it look like 2 not 3. W. to assemble team &amp; get reprint Friday night. P.M. to settle final text. Excused { Whiteley. { M/W. { M/H. { T.J. Food Supplies. P.M. Why have W.O. demands risen. W.O. 1m. more men abroad. Rationing R. released (Yalta) &amp; other Released soldiery. U.S. also have large nos. of released Allied prs. to feed. Also new Allied Forces. 3 Bdg. Brigades here, for example. Remember tht. these are 1945 requirements. P.M. Read latest draft of telegram. F.O. ? Add SACMED. &amp; Pacific. P.M. Civil requirements of Shaef &amp; of other military theatres. L.P. Is exchange of figures by wire helpful. Won’t it be better for our emissaries to take them. Agreed: one cable only. Parliament. P.M. M.A.P. to deal with civil aviation on Tuesday. To open, not wind up. Excused. Ch. Whip. R.S.H.

Civil Service. Entry. P.M. Cisby vice Wasby. Why not Presley for the girls. Competitive examn was a triumph of 19th Century. The odd ones find their place. J.A. This is only fr reconstn period. Some no education for 7 years. They can’t be selected by comp. exam. Must be by selection. Interview must be important. Idea therefore to Let them see the interviewers for longer.
