4. Release of Staff of Electoral Registration Officers. H.O. Nos. prob. less than 2.000. Not more than 2.000: may be only 1.000. V. urgent. Election may come v. soon. Work will be heavy. Immediate action needed if machinery of election is to work. M/L. Constant pressure = miners, builders etc. Fear real disturbance if demobiln scheme eaten into thus. Have said I wd. agree to temporary release of men in Army at home. P.J.G. Strongly supported. M/L. Believe they are not people employed full-time on this work. They are Merely people in Town Clerk’s Office for whom he will ask. Told that from U.K. alone enough won’t be produced. L.P. All kinds of l.a. staff are turned on to this at election time. Won’t they have people to draw on who know somethg. about it. H.O. L.a. are much pressed. We cd. consider letting them go back to Services after the Election. L.P. Electoral registration: hasn’t much of the work been done. P.J.G. Those who have experience will be pretty elderly: &amp; shdn’t therefore be overseas. Home Army shd. be enough to meet it. S/S Air. If we have to give any up, we shd. want to bring men from Eire to take their place. L.P. Danger tht. T. Clerks will use this change to get back staff they want for other reasons. Where are these people? Home Army, ……….. M.A.P. Begin by saying that we will release from Home Army: &amp; ask for nominations, so tht. we see where these people are. M/L. Fear the 1918 rot setting in. L.P. Industry, Home Army &amp; Govt. service: try them first. Ch. Ask for names on that basis &amp; promise considn on merits. H.O. Won’t take responsibility for this election unless this requirement is met, As in Memo. P.J. - general agreement - no one from overseas.

M.A.P. Special release of people in home Army (plus industry &amp; civil Depts.): then see what is size of remaining problem. S/S Air. RAF fights from home: I want a quid pro quo on allocations – or Eire intake over &amp; above allocations. M/L. Can’t do that. Agreed: Temporary releases on this basis. Poland: Draft Telegram to F.D.R. Cadogan. Suggested dangerous to imply San Francisco may be jeopardised by failure on Poland. U.S. so keen tht. they might. Suggested alterations of para. 4. Ch. Para. 11. “If we want San F. to be a success ….” B.B. Against telegraphing. Better let Halifax explain to F.D.R. L.S.A. Why not transfer to end of Para. 11 the addition to para 4. M.A.P. Put the message to Stalin in a followg. telegram. That wd. shorten x/ &amp; wd. give a clearer lead. Wd. bring paras. 4 &amp; 11 nearer. L.P. Decisions needed a) right line b) .. text. Will put to P.M. suggestion as at x/.
