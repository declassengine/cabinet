W.M. 29(45). 12th March,1945. 6.p.m. 1. Greece. A.E. Outcome of discns while in Athens. C.O.S. in entire agreement. Early redn of mil. commitment. Some increase in personnel &amp; gradual transfer of soldiers to B. Embassy. Want U.S. Govt. to be associated. hope they will help to pay. Invite their co-opn. J.A. Agree, subject to discn of details of staff. P.J.G. .. .. .. .. - particularly on timing. Agreed. 2. War Crimes. A.E. Invited Simon’s views. L.C. The Commn have produced draft Convention. Agree that won’t be a good plan. This has nothg. to do with extradition (e.g. para. 2) - Real ques: is somethg. like a Treaty required to enable Ally X to extract fr. country Y a person they want to try in country X. Answer: we shall be ready to deport. We can deal with the situation by executive action. Treaty provisions wd. make it more difficult. Two points a) extradition involves surrender to the other state. Deportn is strictly no more than showing him the door. But I suppose destination can be arranged. b) mutual. Shall we be alright if we want to get someone for trial here. H.O. Agree in principle. But points of difficulty: in adminn we shall have to be sure that our use of powers of deportn are beyond criticism. Deportn as conducive to public good w’out recommn by a court is exceptional, esp. in peace. Extradition Acts have a proviso excepting “political” offences. We cd. however, say that war crimes are not “political” in this sense. M.A.P. Uncertain - deportn is a matter for personal judgment of a future Home Secretary it is not Govt. action. Jurisdiction similar to recommendg on prerogatives. J.A. Not the right view. Home Secy. is acting as agent of Govt.: not in his personal capacity as for p. of m. Absolute right to expel any alien: have always presumed he acted as agent of Govt.

M.A.P. Wording: “if prima facie case is shown” i.e. to satisfaction of Home Secy. How can we guarantee how he will view individual cases? L.C. See para. 6 on p.3. It is the War Crimes Commn who determine in first instance. Second half: if H.O. not satisfied he wd. refer to the Cab. &amp; it wd. be a Govt. decision. Deportn is not a decision wh. is personal to H.O. as is p. of mercy. M/L. Wd. have preferred to do this otherwise than by use of deportn powers. Deportn is subject to undertakings given to Parlt. in the past. This was not a use of deportn wh. was foreseen, when A.O. 1920 was made. Has it ever bn. used for political ends? A.E. Wdn’t agree that these are political ends, as a rule. M.A.P. Awkward for H.O. if e.g. Radescu was asked for. H.O. First part of 6 in Annex ties us too automatically to verdict of Commn . x/ Add “in general”. - Agreed. X P.M. Against being forced to comply with foreign Govt’s demands. A.E. This is the argument for procedure proposed. L.C. Domestic arrangements - we might have Advisory Cttee = or arrangement by which H.O. referred to Cabinet. Doesn’t affect, however, the external ques. of having a Treaty or no. L.C. Only risk is that man may apply for habeas corpus. There might be an argument. Remedy = discretion in administration. P.M. Preserve the position tht. H.M. Govt. reserves right to decide. decision is Govt., not personal, decision. “As regards war criminals H.M.G. wd. Naturally attach all due importance to any report by the W. Cr. Commn that … Agreed: subject to addition of x/ and y/ to para. 6. 3. Food Situation in Liberated Europe. L.P. Went to Paris: saw U.S. Amb. who emphasised importance of help to W. Europe. France. Met 6/7 Fr. Ministers at lunch - 3 hrs discn. France: except in certain areas (e.g. Lyons, Mediterranean &amp; Lille) Fr. People are being well enough fed. No suggn of starvation - so long as supplies continue at present level.

P.J.G. Now thro’ Shaef mil. programme. Now moving twds. restoring the responsib. to Fr. Govt. L.P. de Gaulle thanked me twice for what we’ve done on transport. O.L. 250 re-conditioned lorries p.wk.. L.P. Next day interview with Shaef. Supply now coming fwd. Risk in July/Aug. for wh. supplies not appd by U.S. But living on ship to mouth basis: nothg. in pipe-line. Problem is procurement &amp; shipping for summer months. Transport improved - machinery too, save in U.S. where there is delay. P.J.G. In confirmn Fr. are putting aside 1.000 wagons to take supplies to their prs. in Germany. O.L. 160.000 wagons as cpd. With 400.000 odd pre-war. No doubt of their diffies. L.P. Coal situation improved. Electricity (hydro) restored. Belgium. Situation reasonably good. Brussels &amp; Maastricht visited. P.M. Hear that in Brussels they are dignified but hungry. But their children looked fairly good to me. L.P. Again, however, no reserve. Black market mainly in luxuries. Dangerous period in summer months. Transport better than in France. Tho’ liable to greater strain, the further we go beyond the Rhine. Want to get ahead with raw materials etc., because factories ready to start &amp; cd. work for us. Cd. also make own transport requirements. [Losses between ports &amp; destinations. Was considerable: less now because delays are always reduced. This – P.M. pre-occupation - was worse in France not specially bad in Belgium.] Holland. L.P. Flooded but free. Hope to close the gaps by Nov. Then they can pump it out. We can help them with pumping machinery. Then hope to sow rye for 1946: &amp; get land into good heart in 2 years. Walcheren has saved a good deal of food - saw them thrashing grain. At the other end, where U.S. troops are, they look v. well doubtless on U.S. rations. What is really worrying them is situation in occupied Holland. That is the really urgent problem. P.M. Valuable to have this first-hand knowledge.

Confirms view expressed by me &amp; Cherwell that they have eaten v. well. L.P. Before the liberation, yes: but not since. Destruction of transport, and disorganisation, due to opns. Also Germans put a lot into these countries, in order to get product of their industries. P.M. See any cattle? L.P. No: they lock them up in Holland. P.M. When we have forced the Rhine we must consider wtr we can push a little effort into Holland to clear it up. But we must in any event be prepared to send in food to that area. Some of the inhabitants will need to take their food intravenously. L.P. Read from memo. on readiness to put food into occupied Holland quickly. P.M. U.S. are battening on our reserves, accumulated by years of self-denial. I am resisting that: but for an acute emergency we can &amp; shd use our reserves. F.D.R.’s telegram. Now is the time to say firmly U.S. soldier eats 5 times what ours does: U.S. civilians eating as never before: we will never be behindhand with them in sacrifices: but let them cut down themselves before presuming to address us. A.E. Our stocks are always raided in an emergency because that is only practicable source. And it is never therefore brought home to U.S. P.M. 1) L.P. to convene the ad hoc Cttee: to see C.O.S. himself or jointly with Cttee: &amp; make proposals to War Cabinet. 2) I shd. have material for reply to F.D.R. as above. L.P. This urgent feeding opn shd. have priority first after crossing of Rhine. The planners have now no allocations etc. P.J.G. U.S. are also falling down on promises on mil. programme. Looks as tho’ this is their come-back on us for the U.K. stock-pile argument. 4. Marriage Between Members of A.E.F. and Germans. L.P. Women as well as men. And this wd. prevent those who get into trouble from marrying. A.P.W. Cttee agree to penalties but not to invalidation. That wd. hit the children. The marriage might well be valid in other countries. 3.000 marriages after last war, in spite of penalties. There will be bound to be some this time. Better not to invalidate. Majority view: penalise but don’t invalidate. A.V.A. Service Ministers feel that this won’t do.

P.J.G. a) V. diff. to enforce non-fraternisation. Invalidation necessary for that. b) Eisenhower has secured agreement of U.S. Govt. c) More important things on wh. to fight the U.S. Govt. P.M. Strongly opposed to invalidation. We shd. take a high moral line. Agreed: support the majority view on A.P.W. Cttee. 5. Labour for Cotton Industry. {E. Dalton. {Exit Sargent. O.L. Bring individual skilled operatives out of munitions. Effect on firms in Oldham. M.A.P. Think effects on war prodn can be accepted. M/S &amp; Admy agree. MAP. don’t. P.M. What will effect on M.A.P. programme. M.A.P. Can’t say. Will risk it, if Cab. say so. P.M. War ending: casualties to Bomber Command dropping &amp; this affects Lancasters only. A.V.A. Want to be able to discuss key workers with M/L.: otherwise no prior substitution. B/T. V. urgent. O.L. Mentioned long-term proposals. Agreed: as in memo. [Enter T.J. &amp; R.S.H. 6. War Gratuities: Officers of Royal Observer Corps. J.A. As in memo. Cost v. small. Ques is repercussions. H.O. Possible repercussion on War Room staffs. P.M. Regret having gone into C.D. field at all. Will cause much indignation among part-time volunteers. Will bring us much more trouble with W.L.A. 7. Forestry Bill.

R.S.H. Gives effect to War Cab. decision. Brought here because might be controversial. Doubt if there will be much trouble. P.M. No appeal from Minister’s decision on land acquisition. R.S.H. If any pressure for appeal, wd. apply the new Provisional Order procedure. That wd. bring it into line with T.C.P., &amp; Water Bills. The powers in Bill as drawn are no more drastic then existing powers of Forestry Commission. J.A. Probably have to make the concession. P.M. Example. R.S.H. Cl. 5(1)(b) precludes such action. T.J. Powers exercisable by Commn for many years: but v. rarely exercised. If objn is pressed new Prov. Order procedure can be applied. Don’t expect comp. powers will often have to be used. Agreed. [Exit. R.S.H. 8. Divorce. L.C. As in memo. Enabling: give them power to try: don’t require them to do so. I.e. include among those who can try an undefended case the Registrar, sitting in open court. J.A. Only in Registrars of Principal Probate Registry? L.C. Yes. H.O. Is the case v. Co. Ct. sufficiently strong? The Wedgwd. Cttee contemplated it. And Co. Ct. work will decrease when Ind. Inj. scheme goes through. L.C. Wedgwd. Cttee didn’t approve Co. Ct. jurisdn. Need for uniformity. Co. Ct. Judges - not skilled in this work. The Registrars are. BB. Shd. You put Civil Servants in posn of Judge. L.C. Masters of Supreme Ct. are already. J.A. Wd. they go on Circuit?

L.C. Want power to have it done in Provinces so that some District Registrars may do it later with growing experience. J.A. There will be difficulty if you delegate this too low. L.C. I only want to do it at once in London. But President thinks you can extend soon to B’ham or Manchr. I will settle with J.A. wtr this shall be done by local Registrars or by sending on circuit Registrars of Princ. Prob. Registry. 9. Disclosure of Scientific Information to French. P.M. I wd. disclose nothing at present. Put it off for a time. O.L. Don’t want to be too forthcoming. But must give something. There are pilots (French) who are already flying aircraft with secret devices etc. L.P. We wanted an agreement in order to avoid situation in wh. U.S. wd. give something &amp; we nothing. Ch. No quid pro quo from France. M.A.P. If we don’t father Fr. aviation industry, U.S. will - &amp; we shall lose by it, e.g. instruments, engines etc. There is nothing really secret about the things we propose to disclose. A.S. We are proceeding v. cautiously. But if we hang back U.S. will go ahead &amp; capture the market. Ch. If we tell them, they will make own plans via buying ours. M.A.P. We sold them much pre-war, thro’friendly relations. If we throw them into hands of U.S.A. Ch. U.S. &amp; C.O.S. proceeding on basis of security for G. war. I wd. give no more than what cd. come into Fr. prodn before end/war. O.L. If you mean German war, this = nil. BB. If we don’t get in here, U.S. will. P.M. Why not ask U.S. Ch. of Staff what they think &amp; what they propose. Then get down &amp; discuss it with them. O.L. Shd. we license Fr. to manufacture aircraft now in quantity production. P.M. Limit ourselves for the present to asking what U.S. intend. Adding that in any event we shdn’t give certain specified information. O.L. I believe that will give U.S. a chance to lead - far further than we wd. wish

to go. L.P. Fr. are starting an industry. They will get informn from us or U.S. If the U.K. won’t give, the U.S. will - with both hands. A.E. &amp; H.O. x/ Wd. prefer to send this telegram - which is more likely to lead to a restrictive result. P.M. Wd. Prefer a simple enquiry of the U.S. Refer back to C.O.S. War Cab. much alarmed at telegram. AE., JA. &amp; H.O. repeated warning at x/. Agreed: O.L. and Cherwell to revise telegram with C.O.S 10. Select Committee on National Expenditure: Mission to M/East. J.A. Proposal: don’t object in principle provided they keep off policy and operational ques. etc. P.M. Believe there are many scandals there. But shd. it be investigated by M.P.‘s. H.O. They ought to go - prima facie case for investigation. P.M. My view is “no”. Wd. Be great mistake for them to go at this time. L.C. Ever been abroad before? J.A. No. P.M. They wd. be centres of mischief-making. J.A. With war apparently ending, easier to say “no” now than 3 wks. ago. P.M. Burma next. Where will it end?&apos;
