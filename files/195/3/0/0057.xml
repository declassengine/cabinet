C.M. 25(45). 23rd August, 1945. 1. Syria and Lebanon. E.B. As in memo. Fr. are apprehensive. Attitude affected by past activities of Spears. Police – neutral suggs because anyone else, even U.S., will be suspect. Want authy to proceed on these lines. P.M. Feeling v. Fr. Be sure what troops they send. Senegalese. A.V.A. What procedure after talks? Statemt. tht. if order not kept Fr. go back? E.B. Memo. clear tht. no one goes back unless 3 Powers satisfd necessary. That = safeguard. Wait for agreemt. before considg. announcemt. Don’t want ride roughshod over S. &amp; L. Discns shd. be v. secret: final settlemt. may not be like this. T.W. Wd. U.S. be willing to arbitrate on ques. wtr. Fr. shd. return. E.B. Don’t know yet: but want Cab. authy for this approach before I discuss. Nothing to work on yet. This = only basis of discn. A.B. Why not assocte Russia? E.B. R. never bn. in Levant – involves whole M/East. A.B. U.S. there only because of F/East war. E.B. They have big interests there. A.B. Fear another Tangier trouble with R. Avoid path. feeling of isolation in R. J.J.L. S. &amp; L. are far fr. able to give assurce their Police can keep order. Someone will have to go in if there’s trouble. Visited there some years ago – thousands of Senegalese, almost war condns. S &amp; L. were then askg. for mandate treatment as in Pal. V. serious step until we’re sure S. &amp; L. cd. maintain internal order. Paget returng. U.K. next week. ? While policy decns v. important, wait for confce with him on internal order &amp; Police ques. P.M. See para. 5. It is agreed they must have force. Presume wdn’t w’draw B. &amp; Fr. troops until that created.

E.B. Perfid. Albion atmosphere. Vicious circle: we will w’draw with Fr. when satisf. Treaty: but they say how can we get Treaty while for. troops in occupn. Fear Persia. R. will say on Persia what are you doing in Levant. We went into both for war reasons. Want therefore to start these talks before C.F.M. H.D. Let E.B. start. He can see Paget later. E.B. Agreed to see Paget. A.V.A. Agree with E.B.’s objectives. All I want is to be sure no announcemt. made wh. implies Fr. first in, if disorder. Will upset S. &amp; L. E.B. No ques. of announcemt. yet. R.S.C. a) leave it more broadly than 2 Powers. – “leave to be settled internationally.” E.B. Diff. repercussions re other countries. E.Sh. Has R. asked to come in? If we imply it, there will be quid pro quo wh. they wdn’t like. Better left as it is. A.B. U.S. hasn’t asked, either. V. diff. Parly. sitn unless good reason why R. not in. O.K. if asked &amp; demurs. E.B. Wd. cause terror in Turkey as well as Levant. P.M. We’ve a good case: we’re in, trying to get out: so are U.S. This is only device to avoid suggn of competn betwn. G.B. &amp; France. Wd. be unwise to bring in Russia. b) Para. 8. Our M/E people alarmed at brk. down of Pool if handed over. Cdn’t our people be put into mufti &amp; carry on pro tem. E.B. Certainly, will bear in mind. H.M. On a) is it essential that U.S. shd. come in. R. may seize on that. E.B. a) They have interests b) Mission Schools c) Oil at Haifa &amp; Tripoli d) genl. interest of U.S. in M/East. Also useful in arbitration. Approved general line of approach in Memo. [ Exeunt E.B. &amp; Sargent. 256

2. Suspension of Civil Defence Acts. Ch.E. Developmts. have made these obligns out of date. H.M. Supported proposal in heavy type. Presumably short &amp; non-cont. Bill. Atomic bomb has changed sitn. I proposed to Coaln Govt. tht. H.O. shd. have planning staff. C.E. This is being done. Nucleus organisation in country. That was not taken up with Ty. Diff. to revive on threat of war: wd. like therefore skeleton organn in country. Want further rpt. to Cab. on that. C.E. We are going into second point &amp; will rpt. on it later. } } Agreed. H.M. Consider alternative of relying on Services &amp; Police. } G.T. Our responsib. for Govt. Dpts. – same duties as H.O. impose on public. The method of future defence will have to be considered. But we want guidance on erection of new bldgs. Steel frame with cellars e.g. – shd. tht. be carried on with stronger cellars: in new Post Offices etc. Shd. we give a lead? On basis that it is wise precautn when putting up any new bldg. in certain areas. W.A.J. Bad timing to introduce Bill contemplatg. prepns v. air attack. Inconsistent with faith in W. Organisation. G.T. Not only good for shelter – good also r. fire. P.M. Put it on fire risk rather than a.r.p. H.M. Doubt wtr. WAJ. argument is sound. We shan’t be in a safe world. And easier to continue existg. provn than to start it de novo in time when we do fear early war. P.M. These ques. don’t arise on this Bill. T.W. Reserve power to revive by O-in-C. gives us plenty of room for manoeuvre. E.Sh. Two points a) relieve people of imposs. obligns. No diffy. over that. b) prepn for future. Will need careful review: Need only say overhaul in light of new circs. J.J.L. Much experience of this in recent years. Pity to let it all go without effort to hold it in nucleus organn. No great furore if H.O. said intended to keep somethg. going. Much easier than to start it up again in a few years’ time.

A.B. H.M.’s earlier recommns a) research quietly with C.O.S. No objn. b) skeleton. Either will be moribund for lack of function: or insist on function &amp; become a nuisance. Wd. accept a) and reject b). P.M. Accept this Memo. Refer future of C.D. to a Cttee - ? L.P. Cttee to report in 2 months. Agreed. [ Exit G.T. 3. Raising of School Age. E.W. Our work depends on firm decision &amp; date. Fresh legn needed if later date. But long history of procrastination – l.e.a.’s will not move unless it’s made clear we shall do it in 1947. Wd. be empty gesture if in end we cdn’t do it. But satisfy. we can do it if we get decn now &amp; get what labour etc. we need. Have figures here of what man-power etc., we shd. need. Presume wd. go to M. Power Cttee. Don’t want decision deferred – because all depends on early start. J.W. Pol. mistake to postpone. Figures of addl. teachers – but no figures of addl. accommn: returns of l.e.a.’s not due until end/August. Some people think – I don’t – better to delay than have overcrowded classes. My diffy less than E. &amp; W. because less war damage: I can do it. Want announcement synchronised. P.M. Have these proposals bn. discussed with M/W., M/Labour &amp; Ty.? E.W. Discussed up to end/45. Must discuss next year: now have figures: and must talk with M/H. on ban on bldg. in Ldn. H.M. Pol. diffy. is obvious. But Cab. can’t ignore other troubles – wh. pol. won’t be much less. By ’47 you mayn’t hve the teachers: even tho’ 20.000 come out of Forces. Overcrowdg., deficiencies of teachers, lower quality of educn – may lead to worse criticism than delaying the date. Don’t like announcing before we know we can do it. P.M. This shd. have gone to a Cttee. to work out practical difficulties. E.W. 25.000 to replace m. women. } Addl. requiremts. 20.000 to reduce size/classes. } It is a pol. decn wtr. we stick to this date. It is an old Labour Party plan &amp; if we stick to it we can do it. If you first ask wtr. it can be done the answer will prob. be know [no].

Ch.E. R.A.B. intended to do this on 30.9.46. My view was 1/4 in ’46 or ’47 because of relation to secondary education. Many children won’t be affected until Sept. 47: &amp; 100% not until Apl. ’48. Accommn in excess in many places because of drop in child population. Reduce size of classes wd. be educationally pref. to raising age. But politically raising age has bn. Labour slogan for years. In some backward areas you will get no progress until it is firm. If we postpone date, progressive l.e.a.’s will be disheartened &amp; the reactionary authies will assume it will never be raised at all. A.B. If this announced now, confusing effect on housing. Many authies are both: they’ve just bn. told to concentrate on housing: now drive them on to this: &amp; shortage of staff everywhere. Get over the first phase before we put the double burden on them. In allocatg. resources, we shd. not have our hands tied by an over- riding decn re education. P.M. L.e.a’s must have some target date. A.G. We got the date put in the Bill so as to prevent backsliding by Govt. Diff. to avoid this date. Some lee-way before 100% operation. R.A.B. was trying for an early date. A.B. All I mean is don’t announce for a few months. P.M. Zero date for announcement? E.W. Early Sept. because of financial arrangemts. with l.a.’s. On M/H. points, you can’t build houses w’out schools. A.B. Agree they must provide for schools. Diff. matter to go on with erection. Don’t break this when we are going thro’ bottle-neck on techn. l.a. staffs. P.M. Doesn’t follow they will get on to techn. stage at once. R.S.C. You cd. indicate that we don’t want weight taken off housing. E.Sh. Postpone a week or two so we can consider properly on basis of data wtr. it is practicable. H.M. None of us are obstructing M/Ed. But fatal to make decisions w’out knowing wtr. it is practicable. Long history of that on educational reform. You can’t govern on slogans. Let it be examined. 259

H.D. Cd. the examn be carried out quickly. P.M. Cttee. shd. consider it as quickly as possible. In principle agree to 1/4/47. Date of announcemt. must depend on our being satisfied it’s practicable. Refer to Cttee. &amp; bring it up in a week if possible. L.P. to arrange for this to be examined.
