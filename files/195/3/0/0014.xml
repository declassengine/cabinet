.M. 39(45). 3rd April, 1945. (5.30. p.m.) Review of World Situation. P.M. Welcome to Forde – for first time: and to others on their return. V.2 weapons. New departure in diplomatic relations in future. R. relations have deteriorated since Yalta. Seems to suggest that U.J. is not all-powerful in Russia. Hope we shall get through: but only by unity. New balance (or lack of balance) of power in Europe. Hope thy will come to S. Francisco. But if they won’t I wdn’t prevent the world from rallying round the English-speaking peoples. Achievements of U.S. in bldg. up their present military force. 14/1500 ships in operations in Lu Chu, while this great effort is being made in W. Europe. These are the dominating world facts. How can we match them? Only by our superior statecraft &amp; experience &amp; above all by our Unity. I rejoice therefore at this evidence, in our mtg. to-day, that in spite of our independence we have this centripetal force wh. will give us the power of survival of the Empire. Smuts. World is stratifying on power lines: 3 groups. 1) Russia: gt. continental block, now pushing into west. W’out past or background, new world phenomenon. 2) N. America, whose potentialities none can calculate. Both favoured by territorial concentn. 3) B. Commonwealth – extended with vulnerable lines: but human Record &amp; prestige behind it. World future for genns depends on these 3 in balance. B. Commonwealth – all independent. India, after years of B. tutelage, cd. be gt. power in East. Only bond = our commns. Unity: but must be based on somethg material as well as physical. One of our main problems must be to safeguard our commns. M/East – visited again – is a vital nodal point. Problem altered since Treaties with Egypt or over Suez Canal sufficed. Future of world depends on our being able to pull our weight; &amp; that we can do only if we look to our weak spot i.e. commns. No longer the first power at sea. Posn radically changed since last war. World needs our maturity &amp; experience. Danger of power suddenly acquired w’out experience &amp; mature responsibility – exemplified by Germany &amp; Japan. Hope won’t be true of U.S. &amp; Russia. We have renounced Imperialism. But what of the economic imperialism of U.S.A. &amp; the ideological imperialism of U.S.S.R.

Eire is a warning tht. we may easily break up, as did Roman Empire. Fraser. Interested to be here. Was here 1939. Again in 1941, after Greece &amp; Crete, &amp; Dunkirk. Again in 1944, on eve of D. Day. Now, our task is to turn v. Japan as soon as Germany is out. Glad R.N. has bn. given a chance to partake in war v. Japan – a N.Z. warship &amp; hospital ship with them. Must adhere to principles for wh. we went to war. In Pacific we must be friendly with U.S. Apart from one incident (air) we’ve got on pretty well with them. Conference comes at an awkward time. But postponemt. wd. be regarded as weakness. Must go on, even if R. won’t come. Forde. Thanked P.M. for welcome. From No.10. B. Cab. gave inspiration &amp; leadership to Comm. and whole world when in 1940 B. stood alone v. Nazi tyranny. Australian regard for bravery &amp; sacrifices of U.K. When R.N. came to Aust. waters under Bruce Fraser, widespread rejoicing &amp; inspiration in Australia. P.M. We shall double it soon. Forde. Confidence in B. Fraser &amp; his staff. Australia deeply interested, not only in Comm., but in world affairs. The spirit of isolation has gone. Co-opn in war a) in Comm. b) in U.N. can and will be used in tackling problems common to all democracies. Agree wd. be mistake to postpone S. Francisco. Bad for R., I wd. be misunderstood. Evatt. Referred to earlier visits 2 &amp; 3 yrs. ago. Decisions then to send fighter planes. Recd over 900 Spitfire since then. Posn since then v. much changed. Ground for restrained optimism – both in W. and Pacific. Diffy. in getting Aust. Army deployed. Must co-operate with U.S. also – post-war. P.M. Recalled our debt to Wavell as mil. commander. Proof that we cd. strike as well as defy the enemy. Wavell. “Bits &amp; pieces” of that campaign came from all parts of Empire. India is one of our most urgent problems. a) Prestige &amp; power depends on our finding a solution. b) India is in posn to play vital part in the East. Contribn of Indian Troops to the war. Noon. Pleasure to be here again. India fighting with Doms. the 2nd war:

&amp; this bond of common sacrifice will bind India to U.K. &amp; Doms. No subst. Indian pol. opinion wh. doesn’t favour contind co-opn w’in B. Commonwealth. Surprised at China being regarded as 5th great Power, when we compare our war effort with hers. China may go Left: anyhow we must make India strong to take her proper place. W. clarity/vision &amp; firmness of mind approachg. our constl problems we shall find a solution – patience too. But unity with B. Comm., on that there is no issue in Indian politics. Feelings of brotherhood with other Doms. reflected in our attitude twds. S. Fr. As we are fightg a war, we ought to differ as little as poss. among Allies: wonder therefore if we shd. go on if it’s likely to upset Russia. P.M. Encouraging speeches: much food for thought. Must do prelim. work together before going to S. Fr. * Agreed to send message to Hughes – from this mtg. of War Cab. Naval, Military &amp; Air Situation. Air. C.A.S. B.
