 C.M. 54(45). 20th November, 1945. 1. Miscellaneous. P.M.’s arrival. 2.44 Northolt – or later if fog. Ministers to meet him at No. 10. Emergency Laws Bill. Ministers shd. be on the Bench. 2. Releases of Doctors from Forces. H.M. Method of giving effect to Cab. decision. Summd own memo. Gave figures, as in brief. Suggests need for clean-cut Class A releases. J.J.L. Principle: doctors no diff. from others. Critics of principle will use doctor exceptn as ground for general attack. Variation between Commands, if these nos. drawn out. Need for serious thought on method. Adhere to my minute. A.V.A. 450-500 were to be released by end/45. Thus addn of 800 or so in 8 wks. fr. 8/11. Don’t see how it can be done in the time. Only rapid method = Commands to forward nominal list &amp; release in effect redundant doctors &amp; cut into age &amp; service principle. Wd. have preferred to get largest no. in Class B because directable. But agree Class B. procedure wd. be more lengthy. Every shore station 500 or under wd. be w’out a doctor. And all but largest ships wd. go to sea w’out a doctor. S. We will produce the 880. We can’t then release more in Cl. B. w’out replacement. A.V.A. We have to provide drs. for merchant navy in foreign ports. A.B. Always thought release in Class A wd. be necessary. C.E. Favour use of Class A. Even when these releases made, Services will have double the ratio. J.J.L. But some Commands will have less. C.E. That is a matter for internal organn of Army. A. Adhere to these targets. Wdn’t damage age &amp; service principle. E.W. Concerned re health of school-children – season of epidemics. 350

H.M. Cabinet decision must stand: &amp; orders must be given } accordingly. } Agreed. Not concerned with adjustments on methods of release. } No point in further argument or delay – or enquiry. } A.V.A. Must put in a statement showg. what this means. [Enter Strauss, Smith [ Tomlinson, Leonard. 3. Labour Controls. G.A.I. Return of volunteers to cotton when dirn w’drawn. Direction generally can’t be enforced – can’t prosecute – but if limited to 30 we cd. enforce. Administration is crumbling. Enquiries into bottle-neck industries – by prodn Dpts., so that M/L. can retain impartiality in event of wages disputes. Two P.Q.’s Thursday by R.A.B. Want to announce the 30 rule. H.M. Last Cab. discn showed not prepd to enforce controls vigorously over whole field. Regret we didn’t at the start grip these as other econ. controls. Cab. preferred – go on as we are. But becomg. known widely tht. enforcement is not being made. Rot will spread – whole thing will crumble away. Proposed therefore a) E.W.O. b) Over 30’s to go at choice c) …….. as in short brief. Positive line is much better than drift. Bottle-neck industries. Co-opn of Prodn Dpts. is needed. Publicity campaign – endorse that because public don’t know why needed. I will confer with Ministers concerned if this is agreed. T.W. “others” in 4 &amp; 5 on p.1. – want it clear that this includes agriculture. Agric. doesn’t benefit by E.W.O. Advts. attractg. men from agric. No objn on this understanding. C.E. Prison Service. Will be short w’out means of directg. men &amp; women over 30. A.V.A. Shipbldg. We shall lose by relaxn. Thereafter depends on E.W.O.(2) Cd. we be sure that “sympathy” wd. modify acc. to circs. G.A.I. Agreed. B.S. Want control reserved for seed-crushing etc. But announce reservn to “selected indies &amp; you brand them as unpleasant or underpaid. Endorse therefore suggn for enquiries into condns. But you’ll get the re-action at once. E.Sh. No objn to E.W.O.(1): going on always. But on (2). Mining. Volunteers who entered durg. war are anxious to

leave – many do now on med. certs. Decided to tighten that up. Now you propose “sympathy”. Large no applns will be made &amp; diff. to resist. That will create too much trouble for us. I’m not prepd to accept this proposal. Further, this will create invidious distinction – by holdg. people in selected industries. Effect: labour-force declining. Tho’ recent rise in intake of boys particularly. On (5). Is this any relaxation – thro’ Exchanges? Must face the risk if Cabinet insists. A.B. Controls operate more effectively than G.A.I. &amp; H.M. imagine. Many askg. for exemption – implies tht. they believe it is in force. Don’t be in a hurry, when benefits fr. dirn over next 3 months. Demob. men will go to exchanges &amp; be told where to go. Still enough sanction behind the controls to give us some benefit. War-time controls are not killed, they wither away. Atmosphere not yet gone. Endorsed argument re invidious distinctions. Wd. reverse present tendency to raise status of mining. Delay. G.A.I. Delayed too long already. Black-market in labour now. On (5) – can do much by persuasion if we can get the men to the Exchange. E.B. Also transfers prosn fr. man to employer. G.A.I. “Invidious” argument. Doesn’t apply to bldg. H.M. Cd. cure it a bit in publicity campaign. G.A.I. Will consider also, on E.Sh. point under (2), value in the other industry. Key men. Situation shipping – Exchanges coming into disrepute – shall soon lose the whole thing. H.D. These problems will solve themselves when demobn speeded up. E.B. Not true. Re-distribution will remain a problem. If demob. much faster, we shd. have large-scale unemployment. H.D. Nevertheless a transitional problem. Two points a) Must retain firm control over Civil Service – mainly over 30. Assume that is safeguarded under E.W.O.(1). b) Paras. 5-6 on p.2. Caution re wages. Ty. shd. be kept in touch, so as to see where we are getting on relativities. G.A.I. Not so much wages as conditions. G.B. Once you operate this scheme it will operate diffly. All Ministers askg.

for special incln of their industries. Must be on broad lines – all in or all out. (2) What is “emplt. of value”. Anyone can prove his job is such. There’ll be chaos. Recommend extension of prosecutions – of employers. Scarcity of labour – and unemploymt. simultaneously. Collapsing because prosecute worker not boss. Retain controls &amp; accelerate build-up of labour force – for bldg. E.B. Choice – drastic or not at all. D. day system: designate whole industry, linked up with Class B., for one year only. Can’t retain controls for ever. Vice “sympathy” use designation. E.g. designate “mining” etc., on grds. of it’s national importance. But employer must then take the man on. Don’t believe publicity will do it. Need to face the public with a list of designated industries. Show we know what we want. Not a large no. Not just “housing” but all the processes etc., requd to build up to it. And announce it. Need for planned labour economy. I would face control &amp; dirn of labour for such a scheme. E.Sh. We put in our requirements for man-power on such a basis. But if we adopt E.B.’s method &amp; designate all the processes for mining, agric., housing etc., - then you’ve touched so large a propn of the total labour that you must control the lot - &amp; enforce the control. Need also for plan re exports. Too much emphasis on exports, not enough on home consumption. x/ Delay decision on controls until we have such a plan. G.T. Repeated x/. There is still some value in controls. They do have some effect still. If you designate, 65 industries must be designated for bldg. This loss of grip was inevitable as 56 days leave for Class A made it impossible for Exchanges to work. Men still in industry believe they are subject to control. R.S.C. 11/2 m. short: &amp; no decn where that shortage is to fall. Form of labour control – not tempy because we shall be short of labour for years if we are to do what we want. Short-term – e.g. (4) in memo. won’t do. Every Minister will add to these industries. Because of over-all shortage, everything will come under (4). Plan is being prepd . Need = hold posn until we have sensible means of directg. distn. Believe somethg. on G.A.I.’s memo. = best in sight. But (4) won’t do: unless limited e.g. to mining &amp; bldg. H.M. No need to make statement this week.

x/ Cd. E.B. &amp; G.A.I. together, with offls. (incldg. mine), go thro’ the memo. &amp; bring it up again. G.A.I. V. well. But must have a policy supported by Cabinet. Agreed at x/. [Exit B. Smith 4. Housing. Progress Report. A.B. This is our part of the plan. Para. 2 figures - split into propns not finally fixed. As betwn. traditional &amp; perm. prefab. this isn’t fixed. Accepted tenders – figure has risen since. At present more concerned to get even spread over whole country. G.B. In Scotland too, its distribution not totals. Tenders in fr. all areas. Delay = temp. house. Only 228 completed to date. That = greatest bugbear. Resist statg. numerical p’mme. Experience of 1919 etc. 1922 maximum 18% of bldg. labour force on bldg. houses. Cost: remember last time. This will be our Achilles’ heel. Need for much more drastic powers. 5. Repatriation of Poles. E.B. This has become pol. game. Moscow-sponsored group in P.P.G. don’t seem to want them back – at any rate in nos. W.S.C.’s pledge has made pol. division in Pol. Army. Propose “contracting out” – i.e. those who don’t want to go fall out. My evce = o.r. do want to return. If they don’t go soon, they’ll be prejudiced for ever – as land from break-up of estates is now being allocated. Give me some ships &amp; I can then negotiate with P.P.G. re reception. H.D. Most desirable from Ty. angle. Once it starts, it will flow. H.M. Cabinet agrees to 1 and 2 in brief. Boils down to shipping. What can M/W.T. do? G.Strauss. Some expected troop movements delayed – ship available 2/3.000 a time from next month to Gdynia Cd. lift the lot in 3 months. Subject to Admy. clearance on safety. J.J.L. Effect on Canadian lift? G.S. No. Agreed. 6. Tourist Traffic from U.S.A. 354

E.B. To counter isolationism in M/West and Universities. To earn dollars too. Believe Universities will play. Want help from M/S. and M/L. on hostels. B/T. Supported. A.B. If “hostels” includes mine - &amp; in any event resist use for this purpose of hostels which cd. be used for housing. When I am takg. householder’s spare rooms. E.B. Some are in places where no housing shortage. Will consult Health Dpts. on that. H.M. x/ General blessing: let D.O.T. convene Junior Ministers to consider scheme &amp; report if any diffies. E.W. Vacation courses in Universities – also in schools in connn with traing. of teachers. Deprecate pushg. our people out in favour of Americans. E.B. No intentn to use anything but spare accommn. G.T. Competing claims already to hostels. Might use some outliers. Cab. recogn. already priorities. G.Strauss. Shipping also – because congestion on westward. e.g. 100.000 brides! Agreed – as at x/. [Exit Buchanan Strauss. 7. Spanish “Prisoners of War” in U.K. J.J.L. As in memo. C.E. Brought here by W.O. w’out consultn &amp; w’out regard to our immigrn policy. Wdn’t have bn. allowed in as civilians. Many have wives etc., in France. Wd. have to stipulate v. re-union. They have no claim on us. Why add to our undesirable foreign propn. H.M. Why not take them back? E.Sh. Only 220. Why not keep them? H.M. Wives are in France – why not there? E.B. I can’t isolate these – because sp. refugees in Gib. whom I’ve bn. trying to move to Mexico or Venezuela.

355

Postpone &amp; make another shot at French when they have a Govt. Want guarantee fr. France tht. they won’t put them into Spain. Might send at least those with families. Law apparently precludes restn or condn on release. [Enter Whiteley. x/ Cdn’t we take such powers, even temporarily? Cd. get some value for money if we had parole system. A.B. Did they fight in Spain? Members of international brigade? Kept in camps in France - &amp; easily accessible to Germans. Shdn’t therefore treat them as scum. H.M. Adjourn 2 weeks F.O. to approach French } Agreed. H.O. to consider x/. } G.A.I. Emplt. of Ital. p.o.w. on wages. Shdn’t be prejudiced by releasing these first. 8. Parliament: Re-building of H/Commons. H.M. P.Q. by Maxton – askg. wtr. we wd. choose another site. Cab. wdn’t. want to change – agreed. This cramps what you can do. Chamber – suggn of larger room. New members don’t realise arguments – a) often empty b) temps. of crowded House. Newspp. suggest more disposn to reconsider than I had. Do we stand firm? W.W. Many new Members have since examd plans &amp; are better satisfied. H.D. Select Cttee. on condns of work. Wd. like to resist attempts to get this raised. But favour compuls. purchase of Bridge St. bldgs. for offices etc., for Members. Wd. like to follow up if Cab. don’t dissent. P.L. Only 2 possibilities – on old site: or wider. Sup Cttee. examd &amp; favoured old size. Also gt. upset to reverse this now.
