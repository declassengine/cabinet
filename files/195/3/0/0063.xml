C.M. 45(45) 23rd October, 19451. Food for Europe B.S. I’ve said my 1st duty = maintain rations at home. Motion deals with transport coal etc., - food only incidental. Figures of supplies of food sent, or commn to send: 1.110.000 t. from stocks by end ’45. Calory levels – being maintained in practice save in Germany – where only 1300/1400 calories. Vitamin C: supplies in Switz. wh. cd. be bought for Francs. If Fr. have shd. have to replace at cost of dollars. Wheat for Germany: shd. be explored. First: reduce stocks below W. Agricult. minimum: Second, U.S. to use maize rice wheat for feeding stuffs. 250.000+ programmed for G – 112.000 for B. Zone. Trying to procure. But Canada unwilling to supply: may have to buy from U.S. Other diffies: Wavell wants 2 m tons/wheat if he can’t get rice. Possible concession para 10(b). 2m of these Arctic packs. Others are in Pacific &amp; wd. have to be brought back. The dried fruits are L. Lease. Potatoes: 50.000 tons on assumption of favourable harvest. Total 10(b) &amp; 7lbs per head for popn of B. homes of G &amp; Austria. From stocks – cd. not be repeated. Para 10(a). Late Govt. opposed to parcels. Hope we shall be. too. But a scheme for giving up points goods (not points) &amp; collectg. thro’ a voluntary organisation wd. be practicable; and I wd. ship it. J.J.L. V. complicated ques: can’t be settled at short notice. Any cut in wheat supply to Europe wd. have bad effect. We want time to discuss with C. Commn P.M. We aren’t dealing with Wheat today. A.B. Cttee. on Epidemics: we think 1500 cal. already dangerous. will it be reduced if this wheat can’t be sent! B.S. Yes. A.B. What calory value from para 10(b)? B.S. Cdn’t say. Enquiries procdg: hope to be able to submit better proposals on wheat later. P.L. Cdn’t we send more potatoes? B.S. Must be conservative. Need for feed for own animals. 291

A. Maize: surplus in Argentine, being used for fuel. S. Afr. cd. supply coal, but can’t agree on price. Wd. make gt. diffce if this maize cd.. be made available for food – dollar diffy. P.M. Point for debate: deficiency in Germany &amp; Austria, B. Zone. What are we going to say. Argument in memo: world shortage save. a) maize in Argentina b) U.S. use of wheat for cattle. Are you going to bring that out in debate? L.P. Draw attention to terms of Motion. a) Can’t generalise re Europe. Some countries are better off in some things than U.K. The House must be informed of facts. b) Politics v. awkward. Contents of packs in 10(b) – many people here wd. like those foods. But posn will deteriorate as winter goes on; &amp; pressure will increase. c) Calory. 1500 not enough to work on. d) Motion: drafting is awkward: can’t easily accept as it stands. First ques.: shd. U.K. try to act uni-laterally or seek international action. Hynd. 1550 cal. is not accepted by Robertson as minimum in present condns in G. 2000 cal. = the mark to prevent serious trouble in G. &amp; A. These packs contain little calory value. Fish coming in, but can’t be distributed. Our people say - diffies esp. fr. B. troops giving their rations to children who are prof. collectors for the black market. Addl. 7lbs p. head won’t take them thro’ winter. Motion refers to adl. coal fr. Ruhr. This is crucial, &amp; can’t be secured w’out more food. Two ques. on Motion: a) Public opinion. Resolution. Tense feeling in H/C even on Stokes’ adjournment. Comparison wrong – with rations in U.K. etc. where other food available. Need for proper standard of comparison. b) Govt. shd. have clear, long-term policy on this ques. E.B. I am speaking. Motion as a whole addressed to R. policy. Food = incidental. The guts of this is first part. Esp. if people like Stanley have put their names to it. What shall be my line? In A.P.W. days, we said Europe can’t be fed unless treated as a whole. Think that must be declared – with implicn tht. any Govt. acting to contrary is perpetuatg. these condns. At C.F.M. tried to ascertain what surpluses fr. Romania &amp; Bulgaria (natural larder for S.E. Europe incldg. Vienna). No satisfy. answer: they now have deficiency because R. policy there. Hungary too: Treaty ties 50% of prodn to Russia, if it goes through. That is why

I’ve had to protest. All these policies are for benefit of Russia wh. in normal times is surplus country. Para.(3) of ‘Motion’. R. have declined to co-operate in work of E.E. Council. Also waterways, wh. cd. have bn condn to this. Shd. like to say what U.S. offered at C.F.M. &amp; refer to R. attitude. Two views in H/C. a) go carefully &amp; mend threads b) Come out with truth. This motion suggests want to force it out. A.B. We shdn’t cloak the facts. People shd. know – and shd. appreciate consequences of a policy wh. perpetuates war after its over. Epidemics – takg. our occupying troops &amp; pos. spreading to U.K. Mistake for E.B. to speak. Foreign policy significance. Better keep it factual. Avoid dipl. significance attachg. to what is said. Then we can talk plainly about effect on R. policy. Agree with H.M. Shldn’t try to solve unilaterally. We shd. approach R &amp; U.S. &amp; seek for concerted action. P.M. That implies we haven’t done so already. E.B. Wd. be misunderstood if I didn’t speak to (1). E.W. Don’t be too sentimental. a) Epidemics. Good precautionary services at work. Not a great risk unless we have something new. A.B. Our experts take a v. serious view – if calorific standard is reduced. E.W. b) Talking in terms of calories p. head over whole popn ignores fact that many people in G. are doing quite well – e.g. farmers &amp; untouched towns. Real problem = children in town. Recommend concentrate our efforts entirely on them. Old people will die anyhow. E.Sh. Let’s get some points clear. a) Can’t settle uni-laterally. If that’s agreed, who but E.B. cd. speak. And somethg. must be said about R. policy of forcing people in W. Zones. b) Feeding wheat to cattle in U.S. ought to be brought out. c) Wheat policy internationally – can be settled later. What our approach shd. be. d) Coal. Production in Ruhr is improving – we are doing all we can eg. by sending out techn. experts. Don’t give G. miners more food – because B. miners cd. do with it. e) Argentine maize. “If fuel export needed to extract it, we may have to do it. But tell B. public.

293

f) Don’t believe B. people wd. react v. contents of parcels if facts re W. Germany known. E.B. Argentine. Trouble is with U.S. &amp; it’s political. Tried in Arg. to get U.S. to give us a truce with Argentine while we get food out. Still worth an effort to get sensible U.S. attitude twds. Argentina. Believe they might send us food on credit., in spite of large sterling balances. Actions of U.S. re L.L. makes it easier to deal with such countries. Will take it up again. Diffy. over U.N.R.R.A. – not hopeful of getting 1% from U.S. $4.500.000 Congress may adjourn w’out dealing with this until Jan. And it be broke by then. Mustn’t fall betwn. 2 stools. We’ve undertaken to go to the 1%. A.V.A. Cause &amp; failure of exporting countries to come fwd. Wd. it be well for M/F. to go out to U.S. &amp; Argentina. B.S. At least get C.F.B. to approach U.S. re feeding to cattle. P.M. Points for speech – a) We’ve bn. attackg. G. for 6 years. Absurd to expect good condns at once. Warned G. of consequences of fighting on. b) We can’t deal with this alone not matter for unilateral B. action.. We can say what food we’ve sent. [And promise 10(b) – for “save the children”. Without detailing what kinds of food] c) Russian policy. Extruding people into our &amp; U.S. Zones. d) Additional supplies – must be from exporting countries, not from us. Quantities depend on U.S. policy re cattle &amp; U.S. attitude twds. Argentina. E.B. Shd. consider speech on these lines. Debate may run to food at end. ; And M/F. can wind up and add []. J. Don’t discard existing machinery C.F.B. in favour of Supreme Ec. Council &amp; failure of similar body at end/last war because lack of executive power. C.E. Give it to children, thro’ school meals, &amp; only those who need it – and it will be nearly 2lbs a week thro’ the winter. P.M. Not into the pool: specl. scheme thro’ our machinery. P.M. Para. 10(a) Not to friends. R.S.C. Restrict it to supply thro’ the “save the Children” scheme. P.M. Importing enough only to feed own people. If someone uses less points, available for others. Danger of pressure to sacrifice.

On the whole I’m against 10 (a) R.S.C. Some outlet for altruism wd. be useful. Cd. you let people contribute money against 10 (b) goods. Will ease sense of frustration. P.L. Agree with R.S.C. 10(a) wd, do. B.S. Half our popn have got some hoarded food. If they wd. give that up, it wd. help. P.M. Discuss – as in 10(a) – with sponsors. Might promise that. Reconsider 10 (a) – see if you can bring in the Save the Children Fund. E.B. Give it time.: &amp; if you do it, do it quietly. Let M/F. discuss with P.M. 2. Promises of War: Return of White Prisoners to Germany E.B. Summard memo. T.W. No objn so long as we get a corresponding no. here in return. J.J.L. Will do our best – transport limitns. A.B. Same point., esp. M/East. prs. E.B. Start with them in U.K. J.J.L. Diffy. = inward, clashing with leave &amp; demobiln. R.S.C. Political white prs. who wd. be invaluable in re starting democr. in G. &amp; A. E.B. Am considering that: let’s deal with it separately. Approved. 3. Supply of Equipment to Spain E.B. Different fr. policy twds. Argentina: but we must take a stiffer line with Spain. Danger that U.S. will slip in. A. Civil aircraft – if none on other side – cd. be useful for suppression of insurgents. R.S.C. Applies to cars also. A. A bit different – we are holding down Germany with an air force only. 295

E.B. If it’s under licence you can discriminate. On trainer aircraft will try to get agreement with U.S. : but trouble is they leave commerce to follow separate course. A. Wd. be satisfied if B.O.T. will bear my point in mind. A.V.A. I have 2 points wh. I can discuss with B/T. Approved.
