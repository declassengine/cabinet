 C.M. 53(45). 15th November, 1945. 1. Parliament. H.M. Wed. – Elections &amp; Jurors or Housing Materials. Probably the second. Thur/Fri – F. Affairs. Expect P.M. to be back. E.B. &amp; P.M. anyway – 3rd spker. if necessary. E.B. I cd. open on Thursday – leave Friday to P.M. N.B. cd. wind up on 1st day. – clear ordinary F.O. business on Thursday, and keep Washington business separate. H.D. We may have meantime decn on W. talks. U.S. may have publd. May be diff. to keep it out of debate. H.M. On Bldg. Materials – M/W. to open: M/H. to wind up. H.M. Opposn thinkg. of tabling Motion of gratitude to Eisenhower &amp; other commanders. R. Glyn has suggd Parlt. shd. receive E. as Supreme commr. I expd doubt – other Supreme commrs. too. P.M. agrees it wd. not be desirable. R.S.C. Give him a dinner – Cabinet &amp; some opposn members – e.g. in H/Commons. You do this to visitors, not to our own people. Agreed: R.S.C. suggn to be put to P.M. 2. Town &amp; Country Planning: Compensation &amp; Betterment. H.M. Coalition Govt. considered for years &amp; cd. find no solution. Sub-Cttee of L.P. Cttee settled principles – remitted to officials to work out – Ministers then considered again. Agreement reached by offls. &amp; Ministers save on 2 Ty. points: a) amount b) date of compensation. If we can remove the speculative development value, we shall have struck a gt. blow for planning. What we are at is to socialise development values at one stroke; &amp; thereafter planning can proceed on merits, purchase can be cheaper, land natn ultimately will be cheaper. Outlines pros and cons. of disputed points. Supported majority view. Shan’t get going with planning unless this is done. Ty. want to watch relative costs of c. &amp; l. &amp; adjust policy to fit finance. Fear that will lead us back to old situation in wh. planning is frustrated by finance. At this stage, want only decisions of principle – so tht. prepn of Bill can proceed. H.D. Issues stated in memo. I cd. not be present at Cttee’s last mtg. – nor cd. F. Secretary.

Favour bold planning: want T.C.P. to have full powers: wd. like chance to discuss with L. Silkin on various suggns. On 2 major points. Have bn. workg. on financial policy which will be consistent with our Party policy but continue confidence. Here for first time is a proposn to commit U.K. to an entirely unknown amount of money. That really is too starry-eyed even for a Socialist Govt. Might feel different if we cd. get some element of known into this ocean of unknown. To whom will these unknown payments be made? To land-owners, in return for theoretical developmt. values wh. will never be realised. Don’t think more than 25% wd. in fact be developed – even less perhaps. 50% to 40% is no concession to me. So much for the amount. On timing. Issue of this money 3 years fr. passing of Bill = eve of Genl. Election. Worst possible time. Slump gilt-edged securities – raise interest rates – impede cheap money policy. Trying to reduce borrowg. rates for housing – wd be frustrated. No other time wd. be much better if it has all to be done at once. Betterment is illusory for many years. First thoughts were best – before officials got at it. Min. Mtg. 28/8 – para. 36. Why did we depart from this? Because offls. thght. it wd. choke adminve machine with bogus applns. That adminve diffy shd. be faced: means must be found of curing it. Have had no direct discussion with Minister. Wd. like one. L.S. Ready to talk. But if we are to get this Bill, this Session shd. give instns to-day. True we can’t say what it will cost. But doesn’t follow that its infinite. My figure is between £250 and 500 m. Not much scope for changes in existg. use in developed areas. But even assume cost will be equal to that in undeveloped, cost on Barlow estimate is £800 m. Say £1.000 m if you like: we pay only 40%: my upper limit is therefore £500 m. That amount must be paid anyway. On C/E method it may be by instalments. But will it? 95% will apply at once. They will have to be handled: if decision not given w’in 2 months they are deemed to be refused – under existg. law. If 95% applied it wd. be not a matter of admin. inconvenience, it wd. be an impossible clog in all planning authies throughout the country. The machine wd. stop. You wd. save no money, in the aggregate, now in point of time. Further reason. We are socialisg. d. values. Must belong to community so tht. our planning can be free of financial frustration – in individual cases. Thus, acquire at one stroke: then plan on merits. Mustn’t be financially blind. Policy of allowg. greater developmt. might be justified if betterment isn’t coming in fast enough. Wd. be a legitimate argument. But want that on policy, not on individual applns.

On percentage – admit figure is speculative. Uthwatt said aggregation wd. be 2-3 times too high = between 331/3 and 50%. Ty. suggn of 25% is below the only touchstone we have. We cd justify 331/3 by refce to Uthwatt: but cdn’t justify a lower figure. Willing to go down to 331/3%. Willing to adopt 5 years vice 3. – that was the term mentioned in U.P. on Control of Land Use. It was criticised then: you take his developmt. right fr. him &amp; don’t pay for 5 years. Suggest – 5 years &amp; 331/3% &amp; will talk to H.D. T.W. C/E. is committed to indeterminate figure, even on “as &amp; when” basis. Contingent sum – but only 40% not 100% of it. “As &amp; when” wd. be fatal to agr. and – because it wd. be said to be too expensive to prevent its development. [Exit T.W. E.B. All other points agreed? Is it only 331/3% and 5 years? What about the close estimatg. of total cost. H.D. Yes: the total remains uncertain. Tho’ I accept 331/3% and 5 years. Can I have £500 m. as a ceiling – in the Bill? [Enter C.E. E.B. Always argument re total sum. If 331/3% + 5 yrs. is accepted, will H.D. accept the princ. of the scheme &amp; instruct Ty. with T.C.P. x/ to reconsider total cost &amp; report again on that to Cab. Can’t yet decide wtr. it ought to go into Bill. (Cdn’t put both total &amp; estimate.) But you cd. be in position to make a statement in Parl. on introdn of Bill. A.B. Ty. diffy. = unloadg. in cash what is only potential developmt. value. Paying in cash for somethg. which no one has worked on. This might easily be an inflationary act. Can’t you recognise compromise. a) freeze posn so tht. planning can proceed. b) sifting machinery so as to postpone paymt. until developmt. about to occur. R.S.C. Aim = limit area of claim. ?Associate with the claim an option to y/ purchase by l.a. or L. Commn. That wd. rule out many claims. People wd. hesitate to claim. Agreed: As at x/ and T.C.P. to consider y/. J. Wd. like to see gradations of percentages acc. to ripeness etc. To avoid injustice, paying some too much, others too little. Cd. H.D. and L.S. bear this in mind in their discussions. H.D. Shd. come back to Cabinet anyhow. H.M. When Bill is ready. A.B. Gradations in time as well as amount of payment. [Exit Silkin.

3. Atomic Energy. H.M. Handed in Harvard 17 &amp; 18. E.B. One thing we prev. forgot. Reservation shd. be made re power of veto. Which cd. nullify the whole thing. No one shd. have power of veto on this. Directive to Commn cd. invite then to consider that point. Needn’t ask that it be in the statement, tho’ P.M. cd. consider that point. Needn’t ask that if be in the statement, x/ tho’ P.M. cd. consider that point. Agreed. R.S.C. y/ Para. 3: 2nd sentence. Para. 6 last sentence – contradictory. A. Para. 3: production. Para. 6 = use. R.S.C. Not convinced. E.Sh. Point is U.S. will not disclose production know-how until we can get satisfy. guarantees re use of bomb. Think U.S. have whip-hand – meanwhile they can use the informn as they like for industrial purposes. And until all other nations come into agreemt. on bomb, we can’t have industrial knowledge. R.S.C. Other arrangemts. for us &amp; Canada to get the practical knowledge for industrial use. This is the 3 Parties addressing rest of world. E.B. Quebec Agreemt. covers that - &amp; must be cleared up. E.Sh. Cabinet hasn’t enough informn. Have we really got the practical know-how &amp; can we use it for industrial purposes. R.S.C. We’ve got it all up to end/war. Agreemt. to pool for mil. purposes: but we were limited on industrial side by discretion of President. We have asked P.M. to secure release fr. that clause. But that is a matter between U.S., Canada &amp; ourselves. H.M. P.M. will report on that. A.V.A. Cl. 7(d). Thought we had agreed inspn impracticable. H.M. Yes: but no harm in Commn considering it. A.B. Idea was – make a new start &amp; inspire confidence by a gesture at this moment. We haven’t done it. This document will cement W. v. E. Hemisphere bloc. V. serious consequences.

E.B. Essence of this = Para. 7. New principle. Removes it from U.S. Too much talk of a. energy: not enough of other weapons. H.M. Can I remind P.M. of x/. Call attention to y/. R.S.C. End of 6 – “just as soon as the procedure suggested in 7 can be carried through.” Information to Parlt. Read it out at 4 p.m. if P.M. agrees. Agreed. 4. India. Remit to India Committee. 5. Ceylon. Approved.
