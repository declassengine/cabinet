C.M.10(46). 31st January 1946. 1. Parliament. H.M. Gave particulars.

P.M. Congratulations to Ministers on Coal Bill.

A.G. Friday looks thin. Last Mon. we cd. have done more. Time now to pack in the odds and ends. H.M. We’re not short, in genl. of legisln. Not looking for more Bills. W.W. Investment and Control Bill can go to Cttee upstairs. H.D. Agreed. E.Sh. Thanks to H.M. and M.D. 2. Fees for Wireless Licences. H.M. 4 P.Q.s – re payment by o.a.pensioners : some add widows etc. Sentimental but may be troublesome. M.o.l. favour giving way at once. Don’t like starting down this slope – which = special case. Just about to increase pensions. Widows follow. P.M. Supported these doubts. H.D. House in sentimental mood. But objectionable concession – door wd. be pushed wider open. Exemptions for administration change undesirable. £600.000 additional cost – for o.a.p. and widows. That isn’t much : it’s the principle that matters. Wdn’t resist to last ditch. R.K. Instalments?

Discrimination wd = arbitrary : and I wd. need statutory authority.

H.M. Advise try to hold the position.

L. Cost about the same. - £¼m. J.G. Only 2 ways practicable a) on prodn. of o.a.p. book. b) limit to those receivg. b) 1.600.000 in receipt – o.a.p. and widows. a) 2.400.00 additional i.e. not supplementary, includg. many in work. J.W. Diff. to discriminate : and many o.a.p. have earnings. T.W. No discrimination. x/. Households – who owns the wireless? 479

A.G. No room for legn. P.M. Stressed x/ : this will be a racket. Agreed : stand up against this proposal. [Exeunt W.W. Listowel J.G.]

3. Meeting of Dominion Prime Ministers. P.M. No announcement yet : will get into touch. R.S.C. Prelim. Dom. Conf. May on I.T.A. Fairly high level.

P.M. They prefer to come here.

2.

H.D. V. useful in case loan doesn’t go thro’. Shd. know by mid. April. G.A.I. Hold it in Dom. like here? India will be included. [Enter Smith, Hynd, Barnes, N. Barker] World Supplies of Cereals. P.M. Deal seriatim with main points. Begin with U.K. position. B.S. Deficit is not statistical. Worse: fear you won’t get out fr. U.S. wheat that is available – because of transpt. and price. C.F.B. now discussing final allocations. Increased extraction rate will affect animal feed. Lose 450 m. eggs or 1½ m. pigs or 2¼ galls. milk. Urged more sowing of spring wheat. To meet feed shortage we must even risk shock to farmers. Grow cereals of all kinds, however uneconomic.

Since allocns. agreed in principle, demands have increased cf fr. India. Can’t oppose increase in extraction rate. Draw attentn. to App. Can’t increase rations of feed, in acc. with promise wh. means slaughter of store pigs and chicks. Will delay for 18 mos. hope of addl. eggs and pig-meat. V. serious consequences to livestock policy and producers. Will destroy confidence in promises re food rations : first time we’ve failed to honour a promise all thro’ the war. P.M. What waste of bread? Risk of feeding bread to chicks etc. Cd. you tell public economy of bread will be necessary to get eggs etc.

480

Cd you equalise that way? What savings cd. you get eg. by not serving bread with meals. B.S. May have to do that.

P.L. Wd. raising our rate help to get U.S. to raise theirs? R.S.C. And you’d get economy more easily here if rate raised. T.W. Against that – more waste of high extraction bread. General agreement to campaign v. waste of bread. H.D. What about reduction in flour confectionery? E.W. Too austere. P.M. Balance : lose much bread if you cut animal feed. Doubtful re extractions. A. Prefer tearing propaganda rice cakes. E.B. Last war we encouraged people to return stale bread to baker. Then use for animal food. Much animal feed collected in 1917/18. R.S.C. Collection of swill now better organised. Dropped only 7½% since end/war.

N.B. Psych. effect on Europe etc. wd. be great if extraction rate raised plus economy campaign and no bread with meals. P.M. 116.000 tons saving by raising extraction rate. But what wd. you then lose by bread being fed to animals : and how much cd. you save by economy campaign.

b) Discouragement of allotments wh. are dropping off. Appeal there.

B.S. I can’t do w’out raising extractn. rates. H.M. Good publicity. Need also for follow-up measures, on B/Atlantic model, with internatl. hook-up thro’ C.F.B. N.B. Conference of Mtrs/Agric. in March. E.B. a) M/Food w’less speech to give the facts. Nature as well as war : cause. c) Can we do more with fruit eg. from Med. Believe things will improve after Sept 1946. H.M. Outlook for 1946/47 also bad. B.S. Fruit : dollars : from Doms. shipping : short of refrigerated tonnage. J.J.L. Publicity shd. take a/c of fact tht. some people are having a grim time – queues etc.

481

T.W. Allotments. Doing our best. But conflict with housing + playing fields etc. E.Sh. Supported J.J.L. Excessive consumption in hotels wd. bust it. // Supra-departmental. P.M. must head off, and soon// [Enter Bevan]

P.M. I will speak later. B.S. Argentine. E.Sh. If they really must have oil, we cd. cut others. N.B. The political embargo by U.S. on supplies to Argentine has bn. w’drawn. y/. Favour small B. mission to ascertain facts. B.S. Supported y/. E.Sh. What exact amounts of fuel and coal needed to get it out of Argentine. P.M. But if addl. food goes into pool, why shd. we send the supplies? B.S. They have some – but it wd. go into world pool.

Barnes. Spoke re increasg. extractns. rate – because core loss to agriculture : waste : and effect on public opinion esp. among women. Stocks still cd. take a further squeeze. Recommend closer examn. and publicity before takg. decision. R.S.C. This isn’t first time we’ve considered. B.S. Canadian agreement. Lost 40.000 last year : 60.000 this month. Canada won’t shift on this. Fr. and R. willing and ready to ship at higher price. Barnes. Shd. be taken up at higher level with Canada. T.W. Canad. M/Agr. told me they have more stocks. E.B. Shdn’t all the relevant facts and possible remedies be considered by an official Cttee at a high level, before we reach final decisions. P.M. M/F. has given us comprehensive review since return from Washington. H.M. Good deal of discussion at official level already. If Cabinet can’t decide, further examination by Ministers. J.W. My Dpt. haven’t bn. consulted.

P.L. Telegrams today and y’day show Indian posn. even worse than as in memo. 482

B.S. 112.500 t. loan to Germany. Have asked for repayment. W.O. want me to postpone repayment. If I do, I’m worse off. R.S.C. My Officials support M/Food proposals. P.M. On balance – Cabinet must decide today. Agreed : (Economy campaign – bread alone - with (rules against bread in restaurants. Postpone decision on extraction rate until later in meeting. B.S. U.S. now report shortfall of 62 m. bushels on export estimates.

Increase Acreage for Wheat etc. in U.K. T.W. Bonus wdn’t give us 50.000 acres more than we’d get anyway. We wd. get 150.000 by appeal. £600.000 cost for another 50.000. And you wd. get it at expense of barley – and in grain weight this wd. be a net loss.

H.D. Bonus on all sown wd. cost £1½m. Wd. be a gross waste of money.

A. Agree re bonus.

Good autumn sowing but much reversion to grass.

Thus prefer procedure in para. 4 of my memo. Wd. prefer appeal – but concentrated on spring wheat. Don’t want barley and oats. Agreed : at y/. J.W. Don’t want to be tied in Scotland to wheat. Agreed. Rice. B.S. Siam: a) On payment as under M/F. scheme. b) Consumer goods. c) Transport : flat bottomed boats. World price £45 p. ton. Burma we pay £15. We might suggest same to Siam.

Burma. We believe 400.000 t. cd. be exported in first quarter. Govt. offers only 50.000. P.M. Diffy. in internal transport. R.S.C. Can’t we send landing craft. Thought it was decided weeks ago.

483

A.V.A. Cdn’t give men to take them out from here. Were going to spare some from S.E.A.C. L.c. wd. be too big. R.S.C. Siam : b) No orders placed. Don’t know what goods wanted. Waiting also for arrangemts. at far end for sale.

E.B. Don’t object to B(a). Tho’ I was pressed to get free rice. (I wd. have preferred to go for tin). Diff. for me to make volt face at last moment. Must use tact. Siamese adept at playing off one country v. another. Ready, however, to p’pone the free rice until 1947. Bird’s latest telegram suggests Rice Unit shd. take our consumer goods and buy direct. Wd. like to discuss that with M/Food. Wd. have to be shared with U.S. H.D. Agree : if free rice is only p’poned.

331/3% cut in Ceylon’s demand. Largest on any B. territory.

G.H. Serious situation in Ceylon. More must be found, either wheat or rice. India. P.L. 2 m. tons in wheat, rice and millet demanded by Viceroy (in telegram today) to meet crop and procurement deficits. Diff. to establish exact figure. Looks as tho’ deficit = 2 m. tons.

This, however, not whole problem. For we are to lose supplies already promised to us. At Cab. on 14/1. we assumed we shd. get backlog of 1945. Now mean we shan’t get that. And m’while demand has increased. Suffered also by losing rice imports for the sake of S.E.A.C. Now M/East seems likely to cut into us too. Burma supplies. Govt. has re-acted violently to suggn. of 400.000 t. of exports. He won’t go above 55.000 t. And asks for absolute priority for its return if needed in autumn. I suggest 25.000 t. with no strings : but priority for return of 30.000 t. P.M. Quite impossible in present world situation to promise return. P.L. W’out giving some assurance he won’t be able to procure the rice. Delegation from Govt/India to Ldn. and W.ton. Support this a) Cdn’t resist hearing them. b) Their approach in W’ton might be more successful. B.S. Backlog. We had to discuss on basis of current supplies.

484

Wheat. I got Canada to give you 60.000 t. I’d lost. Burma. Fear of famine is the trouble. But world situation is v. grave. Cdn’t give an absolute priority on repayment. No one cd. guarantee Delegation. Favour this.

Shd. look at this v. seriously. Another Cab. Cttee for that.

E.Sh. Support that. Some time ago Cab. decided as much informn. shd. be given

as possible. Never carried out. Too much is left to Dpl. Ministers w’out coordinated

effort.

In adminn. need for quick changing and moving machines to improvise.

E.B. Too much talk of G.B. making sacrifices for Europe. Shd. be on basis of

world shortage.

P.M. Much in this – but was analogy is not exact : for the supplies are beyond

our control.

General feeling: Press Burma v. hard to cough up for rice. Delegation to go to London and W’ton. R.S.C. Shd. someone go out to deal with Burma and Siam problems. E.B. Allocation all v. well but machinery needed. And weekly progress rpt. to P.M. Battle of Food – may wreck this Govt. P.M. shd. apply B/Atlantic technique. Long-term allocations will make for inflexibility: shd. be more room for manoeuvre. With a strong Official Cttee below P.M. run by Cab. Office. P.M. What about C.F.B? E.B. Might do better w’out them. B.S. Then it wd. be a scramble – with rocketing prices. P.M. Agreed to form B/Atlantic machinery. A.B. Publicity – to world. Use ending of U.N.O. Assembly. Wicked conspiracy by some newspp. We aren’t influencing public opinion. M/Inf. going. Is the P.R.O. at No. 10 doing anything. Public will react well to a statement of facts. Need for central machinery under No. 10 to present the Govt’s case. Agreed : L.P. to look into publicity problems. B.S. Anglo U.S. Cttee a) to increase world acreage. b) to handle current supplies.

485

Never improvised during war w’out C.F.B. P.M. Ventilate in Soc. &amp; Econ. Council of U.N.O.? E.B. Nothg. much done w’out Big Fish. I was thinking of raising it at informal mtg. of 5. With a view to a) above. Then deal with tide-over in better perspective. P.M. If we have to present publicity on basis of world shortage, we can’t do so while U.N.O. mtg. in Ldn. w’out putting it to them.

N.B. Agreed. B.S. Read out telegram from Washington. P.M. (Doesn’t this mean that we must raise our extraction rate? Agreed. (M/Stage to report what can be done thro’ U.N.O. “ (Burma : Hasten appointmt. of Commr. Genl. and give him this job. (Machinery on B/Atl. model will be set up.

(L.P. will grip the publicity campaign. [Enter Wilmot] J.B.H. The “loan” of 112.500 tons. Ask that this be pressed now. Will be used here for stock. We wd. eat it. Wait untl 1946/7 period.

Our cut is 45%. B.S. I will suspend as long as I can. 5. Shipping Requirements for U.K. Food Import Programme. B.S. No assurance tht. my needs up to April can be lifted.

Losing 60.000 t. in Jan. French and Norw. can put their tonnage in posn.

and keep it there. Canada asks why we can’t.

Sugar. M/W.T. want to keep margin. I’m in v. gt. difficulty.

Refrig. Tonn. 400.000 cub. ft. short. Cdn’t lift applies from S. Doms – or

meat and dairy produce from Australia and New Zealand.

Ask tht. food imports be given first priority as for –

Lost Canad. wheat Dec. wh. managed to transfer to India. wheat, flour, sugar, meat and fats. Barnes. You can’t give that w’out full informn. I have passed such a memo. for circulation to Cab. Wait for that. P.M. A.1. priority claims made – and never conceded – throughout the war.

486

I will take this ques at new B.A. Cttee when memo is in.

Barnes. M’while, can’t accept Canada’s monthly rule. That shd. be re-opened at

higher level.

H.M. Cd. P.M. send message to M. King.

E.Sh. Review whole shipping posn. May have to look again at purchase of U.S. ships. We have seamen and cd. use Poles and Greeks. P.M. Willing to do so, if draft provided. [Exeunt Wilmot, N.B. Hynd. Barnes] 6. Agricultural Wages. G.A.I. Govt. needn’t intervene.

M/L. cd. as conciliating body. Suggest we shd. call the 2 sides together on the graduated wage suggn.

Agreed.

P.M. Deputn. shd go to Agricult. Ministers and M/Labour, not me. H.M. Case the other way can be argued. Labour M.P.’s in rural areas = new developmt. Agric. Ministers = M/L. shd see that group. 487
