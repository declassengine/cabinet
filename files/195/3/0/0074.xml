Potsdam: R. demand for full 1/3rd. Accepted at end 10 only for each for experiment. Now being distd: rest to be sunk. Joint statement – R. won’t agree until they’ve got delivery – for fear G. crews wd. sabotage. But leaked: pressure to know why balance of 120 subs. are to be sunk. Can’t say we wd. otherwise have no guarantee tht. other countries wd. scrap. E.B. No other poss. of removing suspicion at Potsdam – as to what we intended to do with the rest.

P.L. After draft sent to Viceroy, riots in Calcutta &amp; Bombay occurred. His comments derive mainly from that. Handed in new draft designed to meet Viceroy’s point – re-arranged order in the main. Begin with reference to riots: but don’t go on with law &amp; order as suggd by Viceroy – don’t want it to be too much a law &amp; order statement: put that therefore at the end. Delegation. I. &amp; B. Cttee thght. invitn wd. be issued by Empire Parly. Assocn. But India section of it is in suspense pendg. elections: &amp; invitn can’t be issued from India. Arrangemts must therefore be made from here; and we must carry whole cost. Timing. Favour earliest possible date for announcemt. Suggest Thurs. 29/11. By me in H/Lds. By whom in H/C? P.M. Need for care. Likely to provoke demand for day’s debate on India. Then shall have to define our posn. In 1942 Indian leaders were anti. J. Now they glorify those who went over to J. Why did G/India stage these trials in India at time of elections. Trouble with C. Serv. Govt. = doesn’t put its case over. Continuing agitn will produce v. serious sitn in say March. Fear G/India drifting into diffies without clear idea what they will do. Parly. Delegn good idea – but doubtfully wise to send them out during Elections where no Indian M.P.’s. Useful to us prs. but not to India. Need for law &amp; order – firm line. H.M. Agreed. Statement must be made. First 4 lines suggest riots caused by U.S. S-statement. Weakness of G/India. Don’t get case across. Change of Govt. here: wish I.O. and Viceroy cd. get into posn of championing Indian masses – even at cost of exposing treatment by Indian capitalists. If we cd. assume that posn &amp; get it across in India it wd. make a gt. difference. Leadership vice defeatism needed in I.O. &amp; G/India. E.B. Coalition Govt. decided to champion Indian masses - &amp; make attack on social &amp; economic grievances. Even W.S.C. agreed. No gt. progress made by G/India. P.L. Many things being done – but not being effectively put across. Diff. to do in vast country. E.B. But isn’t being done here. No effort to get across policy we started in 1942. R.S.C. That economic policy was frustrated by I.O. and G/India obscurantism. P.M. No G/India publicity even for war effort of Indian Army.

A.B. There are Indian T. Unionists independent of Congress. Good material. Shd. be helped. Positive action needed to get new approach. This statement – beginning &amp; ending with l. and order – will do more harm than good. If we are getting back to re-opening commn betwn. here &amp; India, make this position part of the statement. Why not get T.U. Delegation to go out. Why not get reciprocal delegations coming here from India. E.W. a) What will delegn do. Usually allowed to meet only “guaranteed” Indians. We want to get independent-minded M.P.’s &amp; let them mix with all classes of Indians. And address mtgs. – Indians like attendg. them. Don’t want ordinary kind of Delegn chosen by E.P.A. Why shdn’t Govt. select the right people. P.L. Have told Viceroy don’t want “personally conducted” tour. E.W. b) T.U. Delegn. Only contact with T. Unionists is Police J.J.L. T.U. Delegn is better suggn than Parly. Del. Tho’ I wd. do both. Little urge for better life among masses – but beginning, due to T.U. movemt. Need for appreciation of security risk of “doing (? what) this”. P.M. Repeated warning of big trouble by March. E.Sh. Cause of present riots? R.S.C. I.N.A. trials &amp; Indonesia. Second is havg. v. serious effects on public feeling. V. little public knowledge of what INA trials are. P.L. Riots are stimulated – no doubt inflammatory speeches. Congress intend to attempt big trouble in March on lines of 1942 effort. But Indian leaders are deploring present riots. We are committed to makg. statement. Prepd this on basis of India Cttee &amp; P.M.’s instructions. Principle: don’t have statement on law &amp; order only (Viceroy) but couple it with constitl issues &amp; Delegn. P.M. New developmt. since. Viceroy foreshadows trouble &amp; has no remedy. E.B. a) Statement. Insert somethg. re need for social &amp; economic development. Otherwise nothg. in it but politics. b) War over. Cd. develop radio much more rapidly now Also mobile cinemas. c) Political advisers for Viceroy – as for e.g. Mountbatten.

Dening has done v. well in Indonesia. Diff. training &amp; outlook. Wd. proceed on basis that India is going to be independent State – i.e. apply to India the analogy of liberated area Govt. I.O. steeped in old traditions, can’t be expected to do its own conversion. This was done in S.A. – taken from C.O. &amp; entrusted to fresh minds to frame a constitution. Same idea followed in N. America &amp; Australia. Can’t expect I.O. official to do day-to-day work &amp; also plan for the future. R.S.C Supported (c). Betwn. Cab. &amp; Indian people a gt. block of inflexibility – includg. Viceroy as well as I.O. Must consider: is this the man for this job. Doubt if he shd. be asked to do it. Want also sympathetic people as pol. advisers – divorced from day-to-day work. E.B. Changing existg. Indian Govt. won’t do. Need is to create something quite new which is to take over in due course. P.L. Complex situation – central and provincial Govts. Indian Parties. Trade Unions. Can’t govern India from W’hall: wd. have to send out new men. Statement. Delay makes diffies a) Delegn shd. go in Xmas Recess. b) Viceroy’s anxiety for statement on law &amp; order. E.B. Vice last para. promise further statemt. on our developing policy in India. R.S.C. Limit this to P. Delegn with a little on l. &amp; order. P.M. Stress (p.2) sentence at bottom of p.2. A.B. Re-draft to stress positive elements – P. &amp; T.U. Delegns: social &amp; economic: &amp; subordinate the l. &amp; o. pts. to that. E.B. If my (c) above is appd: we cd. keep it secret: but ask Parly Delegn to study it. Might be better recd if recommd by them not initiated by B. Govt. E.Sh. Be practical. Suppose W. resigns. Prs. it might cause even more trouble. If you are going to disturb continuity, you must know what you mean exactly &amp; wtr. you can do it. What do you mean by “social &amp; economic development” and how do you get Indians to recognise it. If you can avoid trouble, use any language to do it. But if you can’t be sure of avoiding it, keep your powder dry. That’s why I asked the cause. If it’s post-war unrest, how will you handle it? What will Delegns do? Most practical suggn so far = P.M.’s point

re expressg. gratitude for Indian Army. H.M. Support R.S.C. &amp; E.B.’s (c). Agree: Govern or get out. Be firm on l. &amp; o. Let the trouble be between masses &amp; Indian capitalists vice Indians v. B. Govt. Need for acute pol. leadership at the top with a left outlook. P.M. I &amp; B. Cttee to consider how you get policy across to Indian peasants. Let I. &amp; B. Cttee consider statement in light of points in discussion. 4. Migration. A. As in memo. M/L. will be worked in: &amp; they are interested in preventg. Australia from picking the eyes out of our industry. 5. Newfoundland. A. As in memo. A.B. Need statement contain penultimate para.? V. negative attitude. A. Preceding para. is positive. P.M. Object = hint at union with Canada. A.B. But are we agreed on that? A. Maritime Provinces – social services etc., better than anything N. cd. provide on her own. This is real reason for para. E.Sh. Is it necessary? T of r presuppose it. Third para. introduces same thought. Bears on whole ques. of Commonwealth policy. I don’t agree to N. joining C. until I know better what C.’s future is. H.D. Thought Cab. were agreed tht. ultimate union with C. wd. be best. Want therefore to include the hint. P.M. Quoted (c) in earlier Minute. x/ As diffces of opinion, see no reason why we shd. not omit [ ] in penult. para. &amp; omit “on this a/c” at end . A. Agree. Ready to let events take their course re union with Canada. Agreed: subject to x/. 6. Palestine Renegades. 367
