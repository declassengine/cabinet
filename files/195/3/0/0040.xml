P.M. Truman has replied that he approves message to de Gaulle. 2. India. unrestricted”.

P.M. Viceroy told us this a.m. his practical plan. Did not alarm me. Was relieved to know in particular tht. his liberty of choice wd. be unfettered. a) Add to 12A. “….. His freedom of choice wd. therefore remain Agreed. provisionally. b) Paras 14-15 of statement. V. big fish for small hook in para. 12A.

S. Wd. omit 15 for this reason. Viceroy’s special powers wd. not in my view be qualified by these changes.

This in fact affects the way in wh. powers are exercised. e.g. famine. If we hadn’t had Ministers who claimed to be responsible, we cd. have interfered earlier. Agree it does not affect the powers: but it affects their exercise. P.M. Accepted the substance – suggested alternative words (in EEB’s notes). be limited by this action. P.M. Want freedom for Viceroy in method of choosing his Council. L.S.A. in para. 9 insert “under the existg. constitution” - } as end/15 is going out. } Agreed. in para. 11 composition vice constitution. }

P.M. Put it as an appeal – come &amp; take a hand pending larger reforms. Final view of paras. 14 and 15: omit both: Agreed. Agreed: go ahead on this basis. W. Read draft of proposed broadcast. - Approved. P.M. Thanked W. - important initiative - every support etc. Bon voyage.
