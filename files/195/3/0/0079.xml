C.M. 61(45). 10th December, 1945. 1. War Pensions. A.G. Better for H.M.G. to take initiative than risk Select Cttee.

J.G. For 1st time w. compn paymts. will be compared with war pensions.

S.S Cttee have abated some of M/P. demands. – E.g. 50/= rate – because of repercussions. All proposals agreed save pre-injury wife. W.P. Earlier promises to review at end/war – in putting off earlier demands of Coaln Govt. Suggd 50/=. Wanted to get somethg. wh. wd. settle this for some time. 40/= was fixed in 1919. Since ’39 c/living up by 30%. 45/= wd. be only 121/2% increase. Service allowances have bn. raised by about 100%. Pressure to reduce disparity between o.r. and c. offrs. – lowest c. offrs. now get double the ranker. Repercussions on 1.1. Bill. Justification: a) disparity with civilian injuries already b) w. compn raised by 50% c) man in Forces had less money than man in industry – and bn. worse off in other ways e.g. risks. A.G. Need to get minimum disparity betwn. various schemes. Total incapacity is same, whatever its cause. H.D. Repercussion on 1.1 Bill wd. be v. gt. Much pressure to go beyond 45/=. If we did this, cdn’t stop going up to 50/=. We’ve now adopted the W. Pensions model – thus inviting comparison. Some preferential rates for ex-soldier can be justified, but not diffce in basic rate. In 1.1. Bill 45/= is flat rate. Under R. Warrant it’s a basic rate for

E.Sh. Why not give it until F. All. come in?

private. T.W. The c/living argument is awkward. E.W. Inter-war they went up to top of c/living scale, but never came down. Agreed: 45/= as in Rpt. of Cttee. Widows under 40. Report accepted. Post-Injury Wives and Children. E.B. Example: man of 24, married after injury, gets nothing. H.D. My proposal: allowances if he is not working. This is in line with 1.1. Bill. Family allowance = proper method of giving more to children 393

H.D. V. dangerous – diff. to w’draw them once given. W.P. Anomaly – 2 men one married and another not, meetg. with same disability. Worst bone of contention – all organisations repd ex-Service men are united in putting this as No 2 grievance i.e. w’draw the allowance from first class of case (?).

A.G. Diffies with 1.1.Bill.

P.M. Cd. you have a time-limit – e.g. married within x years after injury.

of limiting it.

H.D. Can’t accept that – because repercussions on 1.1.Bill and cost.

H.D. I offered 5 years fr. discharge or end/war, but M/P. didn’t accept that. A.G. Doms. tried to prevent death-bed marriage &amp; failed. T.W. Difficulty about time-limit = long-term hospital cases. A.V.A. View of Service Dpts. in favour. E.B. Put it at 10 years from end/Jap. war. Or let Cab. decide in principle &amp; ask Cttee to work out best method A.B. Wd. prefer to concede the principle. Agreed: limit to 10 years. S.S. Cttee to consider in detail. 2. Shipping Policy. [Exeunt: Paling &amp; Griffiths [Enter Barnes.
