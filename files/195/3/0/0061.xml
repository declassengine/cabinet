C.M. 40 (45) 11th October, 1945 1. Palestine H.M. Appreciation of E.B.’s contn to this. Summary report. E.B. Re-studied in light of resoltn at Lab. Party Confer. – debates – pledges by various Govts. - differences in India. Tried first for M/E policy. Wanted to be able to reveal our proposals for M/E. simultaneously with approach to special problem of Palestine. Took a/c U.S. posn – only partly pol. – wh. risks poisoning Anglo- Am. relns. Cttee unwilling to accept U.S. view that European Jews must be found home outside Europe. But they have suffered so much that they are apprehensive of repetn &amp; some a/c must be taken of that. Harrisons rpt. not based on real investign. Must have such an investign.; will show some Jews must be removed fr. Europe. U.S. must take their share. Caveat. 170.000 Poles. may be left with us in conseqce of W.S.C.’s implied pledge. Not all Jews. We must make that oblign clear to U.S. Para 3(iii) will at once raise ques. how many Palestine cd. take. Interim period betwn. rpt. on Palestine &amp; decision by U.N.O. Long term arrangements in Palestine. Seen Weizmann, with G.H. He believes a truce might be possible if its made clear that we are going to try to find a solution. Told him going away for 7 days. This will give chance to consult U.S. Even if they decline to come in, I wd. go on with this policy. G.H. Appreciation of E.B.’s part in this. I &amp; Dpt. fully agree with Rpt. Weizmann wants to know something before he leaves for U.S. on 22/10. He was deeply impressed by what we said to him. Time fr. beginning of enquiry to point of final decn – will be diff. period. There is trouble in P. already. P.M. Q &amp; A needs improvement. Shd. make it clear tht. Truman has agreed to discn of immigration. Shd. show tht. this is new approach. E.B. Not a political draft. Wd. prefer you to wait until U.S. man replied. Let us settle the policy first. P.M. agreed. P.M. a) E.B. has put this in picture with M/E policy. Does he intend to publish M/E policy simultaneously, so tht. there will be somethg. for Arabs too? 283

E.B. Can’t answer yet. Had thought tht. vice public announcement. I wd. say somethg. to Arabs when I approach them. But there is also Levant &amp; revision in Egypt. Wd. like to reflect on dangers fr. that pt. of view of a public statement. P.M. Put somethg. in answer. b) Must remove impcn tht. all Jews want to go or will stay when they get there. Good therefore tht. 2 things shd. be linked together. Problem is, however, getting over interim period before final decision. E.B. Various expert rpts. on what cd. be absorbed in South of P. Want the Commn to look into all these pts. E.Sh. Para 7(b). “Modificn’. If, as stated, E.B. means “increased” better to make that clear. M/E. policy must come into picture. Jewish trouble = economic. Arab pressure &amp; national, racial, religious on the surface: &amp; among the leaders, but for majority of rank and file it’s not. And we shd. therefore make it clear tht. we have a policy to solve the social &amp; economic problems of the populations in this area. Hope this can be made clear in statement in H/C. P.L. Thanks to E.B. Support report. Three remarks a) Para. 10 fear introdn of U.S. will make it harder to deal with Arabs. Warning – see no way out. b) Proposed tht. Commn shd. go to Europe first. Risk tht. minds will be prejudiced by hardships of J. here: any public repn will inflame fears of Arabs. Cd. they go out as P. first? Wd. like Cab. to consider that. c) Effect in India – even Hindus, let alone Muslims, alarmed. Want Viceroy to be told even before commn made to U.S., where it will prob. leak. E.B. Intended to communicate with Doms. &amp; India: hope to get their support before this approach made to U.S. H.M Agree to inform. But can’t hold Parly sitn more than 10 days or so. H.D. Agreed – sooner we put this to U.S. the better. Risk of violence in P. A. Believe Doms. will welcome this. E.B. Wd. like opportunity to consider all points raised: &amp; settle finally with P.M., L.P., C.D. including P.L.’s pt. (b). G.H. High Commsn P. shd. also be informed. Agreed. 284

C.E. Pressure on H.O. because of this delay to admit individ. Jews to UK. Since liberation not more than 12 admitted. But situation is getting v. difficult. N.B. Timing in H/C. Trusteeship Council expected to be in being in January. Agreed: Policy approved in principle E.B. to consider method &amp; also forum of statement Doms. Viceroy &amp; High Commsn P. is to be informed. P.M. Meanwhile need for greatest discretion by all who have seen these pp. [Exit Honr. Shinwell] 2. International Labour Conference G.AI. Summard three pts. raised in memo. Refce to L/N. – while it stands Russians won’t come in. E.W. Is I.L.O. wise in going fwd. with this resoltn at all? Moving into new fields for I.L.O. We object to resoltn on education para. 5. Danger of overlap between U.N.E.S.C.O. &amp; I.L.O. Suggest all resoltn on eductn be postponed until after mtg. of U.N.E.S.C.O. in (?) Nov. G.E. Supported E.W.’s view. Scope of U.N.E.S.C.O. shdn’t be prejudiced. G.AI The educn section is v. small part: don’t want therefore to oppose whole resolution. Delegates can be instructed to make a reservation re education. N.B. Agreed with E.W. Same wd. apply to para. 3. Clear tht. various organs. of U.N.O will be apprd to deal with these matters. Reference is co-ordinatg. Cttees. for link with U.N.O. organs. might meet the case. A.B. I.L.O. shd. not attempt to overlap with functional organsn wh. may be estabd by or under auspices of U.N.O. If that were stated as a general propn, it wd. be enough. R.S.C. Will para 5(3) meet it? E.W. No R.S.C. Why not? E.B. Workg. Cttee. at I.L.O. Confnc shd. be asked to pass a resolution welcomg. apptmnt of U.N.E.S.C.O. &amp; passing its view to them. P.M. Can’t deal with this w’out seeing draft Resolution. What does it propose? 285

G.A.I Issue questionnaire &amp; frame recommdn to Govts. on that informn when obtained. P.M. This wd. involve going outside I.L.O. scope. Why accept even the principle? You shd. press for resolution to be amended to take a/c of the functional organs. estd by U.N.O. E.B. Let M/L pick out juvenile educn, as distinct from vocational training, &amp; recommend that this is remitted to U.N.E.S.C.O. Agreed [Exit N.B.] 3. Migration A. a) Treatment – some concessions as in Annex. b) Approval of immigrants – got nowhere yet with Aust. Govt. c) Assisted passages for migrants other than ex-Service. Propose: consult shipping Cos. then discuss with C/E. Ask for authority to conclude agreement re ex-service people (subject to later report. to Cab. on “approval”) &amp; to open discns with shipping cos. H.M. Falling popultn. Do we want to encourage? J.J.L. Many enquiries fr. Service men. Good to send some, to strengthen Imp. ties. T.W. Any reason to suppose tht. immigrants will be forced out of towns on to land. I sh. want an assurance on that before I advised anyone to go. A. Danger the other way – tht. they will pick our best artisans. A.B. Why do we wish to stimulate emigration? Why subsidise passages? Much better to leave it to natural attractions of economic opportunities. Don’t load the magnet. 30.000 subsidised emigrants returned to U.K. in inter-war years. And in Canada 50% of industrial popn were unemployed for 4 years. H.D. I have accepted A.’s proposal; &amp; support it. This subsidy won’t change peoples’ minds, it will do no more than help those already determined to go. Want a thin trickle – it won’t be more – to cement Imperial relationships. The nos. won’t be large: the broad ques. raised by H.M. &amp; A.B. will not arise. J.J.L. Supported this view. 286

R.S.C. Nothg. shd. be done to make it easier for Aust. to attract our most skilled industrial workers to start industies in competn with ours. A. I’m alive to that - &amp; have warned Australia. Memo approved. [Enter Wilmot: Buchanan] 4. Municipal Elections P.M. Amplified memo – gave reasons. Ministers have enough to do. T.W. Applies also to Co. Councils? P.M. Yes. H.M. Take a diff. view. Conservative Ministers have taken part – no settled doctrine. We can’t give too much time, but in princ. see not objtn. a) They will be asked to help. b) Some have a history, as 3 have in Ldn. I have already addressed mtg. in Ldn. &amp; promised to go to B’ham. Believe M/Supply has sent a message wh. has bn printed on election address. P.M. No diffy. re messages. Point = Ministries shdn’t spend time on it. A.B. Point for individual Ministers. – depends on relationship between a Minister &amp; L.A.’s. R.S.C. Peccavi – in Bristol: mtgs. addressed. V. awkward to abstain if one is in ones own constituency at the material time. J.W. I haven’t bn to constituency since Election - &amp; now have said I’ll come down to you durg. municipal elections. H.D. Let’s have the rule: but let Ministers deeply commd already carry out their obligns. P.M. What we must avoid is havg. all Ministers spkg, in a single week all over the country. Agreed: Let the Rule stand, subject to Ministers using a discretion. 5. Justices of the Peace H.M. Don’t agree: a) Labour won’t get enough if it isn’t political. b) If there is a rprt. will be asked to legislate. 287

J. This = misconception. I want this in order to get more Labour J.P.’s. I want someone to tell me what is going wrong Remedy = revise Advisory Cttee &amp; get Adjourned: I. is consult with L.P. Or ? J. authd to go fwd. if he satisfies L.P. 6. National Health Service: Hospitals A.B No real diffy. in getting agreement with Scotland: for I don’t intend to leave the teaching hospitals as voluntary hospitals in old sense of term. No other way of getting proper hospital service. – or effic. nursing service. Can’t entrust to l.a.’s because (even in London) the l.a. areas are not natural hospital areas. Resistance of vol. hosp. is being entrusted to l.a.’s couldn’t be overcome. W. paper has to resort to Joint Bds., wh. is worst form of l.a. authy. Argument: equal service for equal contributions. Vol. hospital system has broken down. Success of E.M.S. due largely to its brkg. down local boundaries. Revenue: 100% in some cases will come fr. rate &amp; State funds: in other cases 60% upwrds. Rushing out endowments, less than 8% will be upd by vol. contribns. Protection v. centralisation? My conversn with drs. had me to suppose tht. this will be welcomed by them &amp; will reduce their opposn to rest of scheme. A. In principle, I support this: Careful prepn before announcement. made - propaganda too. Agree: regional organisation is required : diff. from the system wh. has grown up fortuitously. And this calls for national basis. [Exit Cripps, Jowitt] Big teaching hospitals – successful because given opporties to best men. Can’t do this on basis of seniority. Wd. like to see what is proposed on this before public statement made on hospitals. Tremendous outcry is certain. But believe this is right, none the less. A.G. Vol. hospitals going down hill for some time = &amp; this scheme will finally kill them because so many outside Ldn. rely on vol. contrib.. schemes – which won’t go on when a Health Service Contn is payable. Diffy. gigantic task, will take years to compete, in face of strong oposn. Protracted talks with l.a.’s. Vol. hospital will make it as hot as they can for M/H. G.A.I Support from Ldn. experience. a) Govrs. of Ldn eye hospital: gave it up because of govt. cadging by doctors.

288

b) Since L.C.C. took over, stigma of “infirmary” now removed. People prefer to go there than eg. to Guy’s where the Almoner conducts Means Test. H.D. Substantial financial adjustments wd. be reqd? – in block grant. Reserve that to prime l.a. shd. be deprived of a sum equivalent to what they wd. otherwise hve to meet themselves. Adjourn discussion. 7. Housing Cabinet – Monday
