Long warning – Sat. to oppn: Mon. to Press: copies ½ hr. in advance V. of Censure only method for debate – v. proper. But now seekg. to divert it to Demob. &amp; Housing. Wrong to evade real issue - &amp; 2 debates already on Demob. &amp; full day on Housing next Mon. Two days suggd – one day enough. Propose to say nil to-day. – until have seen terms of motion. H.D. Also – failure to reduce expenditure – plenty of chances on Budget &amp; Finance Bill. P.M. Agreed. A.G. Omnibus censure is unconstitutional. H.M. Eisenhower – point behind it, as in earlier Minute. Dinner, either by Govt. or by Speaker. Latter preferable. Repve Peers &amp; one or two leaders of other Parties. Wd. preclude any suggn of discourtesy. P.M. People forget Alex. also S.A.C.

Will say E.B. spkg. to-morrow - &amp; other speakers will be free to range wider. [Exit Whiteley. 3. Greece. E.B. King of Greece, on newspp. rpt., wrote to me suggesting I had offered a loan on condn plebiscite p’poned 3 yrs. No truth in this. P’ponemt. raised by Regent in Ldn. I declined because thght. inconsistent with understandgs. reached with W.S.C. &amp; Eden. Elections: my decln at L. Party Conf. quite consistent with Cab. decisions. I put Elect. first and pleb. after, when tranquil. votd. Mtg. of EAM. etc., put pleb. first durg. uncertainty,

I was told, no stable Govt. Consulted U.S., France &amp; all agreed electns shd. come first. Diffy - King as pol. leader vice constitutional monarch. Similar trouble threatening in Belgium. Policy: get Govts. establd &amp; let the monarch ques. be settled thereafter domestically. Durg. McNeil’s visit – they raised again ques. of p’ponemt. I sent back stiff reply to effect tht. this wasn’t purpose of his mission. Want Dodcanese transfer settled. Get away from political aspect. Under pressure laid down a programme – Election in March: calculated how long thereafter condns wd. be ready for pleb. &amp; suggested March 1948. Then story in newspaper – and letter from K/Greece. Reply was to have gone this a.m. But now he has issued statement to Press w’out awaitg. my reply. Now propose to publish to-day my reply to King: &amp; will make statemt. H/C. Friday. If he does return to Greece, there will be civil war. Told F.O. to see he gets no travel facilities. Hope Cabinet will support my policy re Greece. My view is: can’t hold a pleb. at a time when registers etc., are notoriously incomplete. R.S.C. If King gets back &amp; starts Civil War, what attitude will our troops take. E.B. Keep order. H.M. and We ought to stop him going. others. 4. P.M.’s Mission to Washington. P.M. Met Truman &amp; Byrnes. Yacht on Potomac. I opened on our line: others agreed. Diffies in getting agreed draft. Little time to consult Cabinet. Points raised didn’t go to substance – wh. is tht. this can be handled only gradually by creating confidence. Don’t want it restricted to a-bomb only. Want it brought to U.N.O. - &amp; think it will be. Satisf. discns re continued co-opn with U.S. &amp; Canada – no diffies x/ expected over industrial use. Got beyond Quebec Agreement. Not ques. disclosure of formula. Ques. of visits to plant to get acquainted with “know-how”. Satif. agreemts. re continuing co-opn betwn. Staffs re strategy &amp; weapons. Document on this with M. Wilson. Avoided getting involved in other matters procg. such, e.g. as Financial Talks, Palestine. Palestine statement well recd in U.S. Canada v. co-operative: afraid we were cutting out all imports fr.

Canada because of dollars. Gave &amp; announced helpful formula. E.B. On x/ above: is it clear there is no handicap? H.D. Binding agreement in writing. Is there a signed revocation of that? P.M. I have a document signed by Truman: doesn’t in terms revoke Quebec Agr. Will show it to H.D. Also detailed agreement negotiated by J.A. Statement (will be shared with all nations) applies to industrial also. E.Sh. Do we share discoveries here with them - &amp; is this reciprocal. E.W. U.N.E.S.C.O. concerned re formn of Cttee for exchange of scientific informn under U.N.O. Don’t want ad hoc bodies for each subject. P.M. This wdn’t get across educational lines. E.W. U.N.E.S.C.O. goes beyond education – genl. exchange of scientific informn. Recognise mil. use if separate. P.M. The commn is only to frame recommns. R.S.C. We shdn’t welcome gettg. this into UNESCO field. Too important – both industrially as well as militarily. J. Reaction from Russia? E.B. None officially. A. Relation to veto. P.M. Depends wtr. it goes to UNO itself or Sec. Council. I wd. prefer former. E.Sh. Will you refer to-day to release fr. Queb. Agr. P.M. Only “we arranged for future co-operation.” R.S.C. ? Say Followg. talks with T. I’m now able to say there is no ques. of our liberty to use this for industrial purposes at any time. P.M. Yes. 3. Greece (contd). C.E. Verified we have no power to hold – save on crim. charge. H.O. are examining, however, means of hindering him. 359

S. We have taken steps to ensure he uses none of our facilities. H.D. Put similar stop on civil aviation. Agreed. 5. Investment (Control and Guarantees) Bill. H.D. Explained provns of Bill. Cl. 2. Raised to £50 m. Believe this will be enough, in addition to existg. powers. Included no provn for Cap. Issues Cttee etc. These shd. be non- statutory. The memo. will be prefixed – in some way merging with normal Explanatory Memo. – certainly won’t be White Paper. Nat. Inv. Council – flexible. Don’t want fixed number. This body will be useful in limited field helping Govt. to plan expendre. But don’t want it to have executive powers. Changed my mind as from Nat. Investmt. Bd. phase of Labour thought – at that time Govt. was takg. no responsibility for planning. Now that we do, we can’t delegate our powers &amp; duties to a Bd. P.M. Presentation. If it comes out alone, may look mouse. Small in itself. It shd. be put across as part of genl. picture. H.M. Dilemma. Workg. out machinery for econ. planning. Hope in due course to publish story on this. But can’t talk about that now. Driven therefore to concln tht. we shd. present this as no more than it is. H.D. Can’t wait. Some leak, e.g. re name of Council – has alarmed industrialists. E.B. Nat. Inv. Bd. – invented by Macmillan Cttee. But then Govt. wouldn’t look at any direct intervention. That was why Cttee’s recommn took that form. Agree don’t want it now we’ve taken pol. control of B/E. But don’t regard this as a small measure. V. important powers. R.S.C. Can’t help bringing things on piecemeal. Agree in time compreh. W. paper on economic planning. Hope the council will be closely linked with C.S.O. &amp; Econ. Section. H.M. Add to para. 6. references to Chairmen of 2 Industrial Corpns? H.D. Want to keep it flexible. A.B. a) This is v. important Bill. There will be big pol. come-back soon – v. our invasion of financial interests. Bldg-societies: Lomb. St.: transport all threatened to date. We shd. be ready to meet criticism – especially by counter-propaganda to mobilise

our public opinion. b) Two Industrial Corpns. I criticised in H/C. at the time. Do you need them now? H.D. Wait and see. There’s money there &amp; they are working. Don’t stop things wh. are doing good. Co-relate them later. Discuss on N.I. Council. A. On a) above. This is biggest Bill presented to Parlt. by this Govt. c.f. Cl. 1(a). will cause misgivings among all potential investors. Most important to be ready with propaganda. H.D. We shall publish the Preps. simultaneously. Press Conference on day on introduction. H.M. Transp. House will do parallel education propaganda. J. Drew attentn to excessive severity of enforcemt. provns. Notice: will raise on Leg. Cttee. P.M. Guarantee. Is it wide enough? Prefer “maintaing. high &amp; stable level of emplt”. H.D. No: want it open &amp; flexible. B/T. wd. advise on field &amp; condns. Industry as a whole, not individual form. Want the power, not words. R.S.C. Shd. you cover “services” as well as “industries”. E.Sh. Proviso to Cl. 1(1) covers wide field: Bill not therefore so terrifyingly sweeping. H.D. Cl. 4(3) of B/E. Bill enables us to give directions to Banks. A.V.A. Evasion thro’ banks increasg. loans to such cos. as Bank Nominees Ltd? H.D. Can be covered by B/E. Bill powers. E.Sh. Must have some freedom: not yet ready to control all financial opns. On propaganda. However weak Oppn may be in H/C., there are gt. forces in the country &amp; power of Press. Need for careful explann of these Bills &amp; relatg. them to individual &amp; domestic programme of Govt. Hope P.M. will enquire &amp; see tht. our propaganda machine is effective. R.S.C. B.B.C. – not yet solved. Becoming convinced tht. we must use the B.B.C. to explain our programme. H.M. Party organisation is ready to function.

My point: this Bill is capable of being represented as purely negative. That is the angle wh. we must stress – not measure to stop things but to make right things happen. A.V.A. Also prevent exploitation of small investor. Agreed: approve Bill Legn Cttee to settle details. Propaganda to be well organised. 6. Canadian Citizenship Bill. C.E. Better for conference to come fr. action of a Dom. rather than our initiative only. A. We agree. We want to see it developed on Canad. lines. Para. 10. We think Eire shd. be asked. Conference might be held in Canada. Then Eire more likely to come in: they have a good man there. S. Rhodesia &amp; Newf. needn’t be invited yet. J. Agreed. R.S.C. Important for Trade Treaties. E.W. Women’s organisations wd. be phased. Agreed.
