C.M. 14 (45). 12th July, 1945. 1. Disposal of German Fleet.

important therefore tht. subs. shd. be divided as proposed.

BB. N.I. say naval technicians (G) being invited to join R. Fleet. More O.S. Won’t R. demand newer b’ship? C.N.S. They were happy with Cavour class Ital. ship. BB. U.S. Nav. Staff agree: will insist on scrapping of subs. A.E. Minor Allies – done v. well during war. C. Inform Doms. before action taken. Agreed. Disposal of Italian Fleet. BB. Don’t want them, but want to prevent others getting them Ready to let R. keep the B. ships lent them. A.E. Then need we give R. so many destroyers – if they are keeping 7 of 8 B. ships lent. Hard on Italians to keep only 2. C.N.S. No more nd. go to R. Keep our loan &amp; that satisfies your claim in full. If they return those ships, they must have some share of 4. Fleet.

2. Man Power in Second Half of 1945.

A.E. That shd. be made clearer than it is in Memo. – para B.B. If they are not satisfied they must give back ours &amp; take their chance on distribution of lt. Fleet. A.E. I.e. start on para. 11. If that fails, we get ours back &amp; argue about lt. Fleet. J.A. Referred to Friday’s discn.

Cttee. concluded against “free for all” discharge of women. Loss of efficiency: postpone release of men: discontent among men. Therefore tried alternative of fresh targets for men as well as women. Service Ministers promised to do their best: but gave no guarantee. Referred to para. 8 of Memo. Danger of serious economic breakdown.

C.I.G.S. a) To get near that target we must review plans. Bulk of cuts will fall on European commitments – 12 Divns. 3.D. 3.D.

G. or Austria or Italy

160.000 net increase in F/East. } cpd. 1.700.000

300.000 478.000 Japan

H.M. We agreed to try to meet global increases – allocn between Services

Men: agree the R.A.F. increase is heavy. But we can’t meet our needs

J.A. M/L. wanted this.

+ 2 in Greece &amp; M/E. Reserve. 300.000 to 478.000. } reduction. Need = review again minimum needs as insurance in Europe. b) End of para. 5. Do we get replacements? J.A. Class B. will be increased only to extent that replacements are available. A.E. Don’t feel happy about Europe. Don’t want to see w’drawal of strength. C.I.G.S. 1.1 m. is 220.000 in U.K. Present plans. 820.000 251.000 Germany 472.000 73.000 S.E. Europe O.L. Asking now only for acceleration – not for reduction in Stage II levels. J.A. Catch up on results of standstill. McC. 3 wks. ahead, at Xmas, of planned phasing. made since. Our figure is 5 ½ times our original proposals. Between now + June/46 the RAF. will be inoperative. And that will involve loss of morale in R.A.F. Suggest C.O.S. shd. review consequences of cuts – addl. 93.000 for R.A.F. ? Agree to smaller increase now: &amp; review after Terminal. J.A. Women: let the figures stand. unless correspdg. addition cd. be made for Army. H.M. Wd. accept 58.000 for women. B.B. Can only promise to do our best. 22.000 wd. interfere with Class A. But we will try hard to speed up. C.O. Shd. we treat men &amp; women alike at receiving end? McC. More short in industries employing many women.

A.E. Conclude 1) C.O.S. to consider implications of target figures { allocations of totals between Services { 2) Meanwhile Service Dpts. to work to these targets.

{ 3) Avoid further commitments in Terminal discns (para. 8).

3. Peace Treaty with Italy. A.E. Main Policy: encourage Italy to look to us rather than R. bring U.S. into it: &amp; no objn to their takg. the lead. Need therefore give Italy stability thro’ pol. &amp; economic support. Means: Peace treaty. early election – not before spring prs. keep troops there – U.S. also – to ensure stability till after Election. encourage efficient Italian Army: help + Mil. Mission. send Police Mission. maintain B. propaganda. get p.o.w. back fairly soon. R.S.H. x/ Want to keep 30.000: cd. we keep them techn. as p.o.w. but alter status &amp; give them pay. Then we cd. get them to volunteer. Then take other 30.000 back. L.S.A. 5.350. skilled lt. p.o.w. ship-repairs – important to F/East war. India wants to keep them for time. H.M. No need to keep p.o.w. status in India: that applies only in U.K. O.S. Political re-action here – paying them wages when local unemplt. here. R.S.H. The B. unemployed wdn’t take jobs in agriculture. C. U.S. intend to raise this at Terminal. Doms. Govts wd. then be consulted. Shd. we not now tell Doms. U.S. may raise &amp; assure them we shan’t go any lengths w’out consultg. Doms. Cad. It is our proposal. But I intended to refer at once to Doms. C. S. Africa have raised – reservation safeguarding right to be consulted on cession of Italian Colonies. Formal: by 4 Powers. V. awkward therefore wd. involve consultg. all sorts of European countries. Enough to get it recorded at Term. tht. we wd. be respons. for consultg. S. Afr. v African Colonies. A.E. Want UNRRA to take over Italy – food and coal.

O.S. Some techn. pts. on Annex – will discuss with F.O. Approved general line. Give Dom. Govts. the Memo. [Enter M/W.T. M/F&amp;P.

Exeunt C.O.S., Cadogan

J.A. 4. Coal: Additional Bunkering Requirements. L. Don’t need the large coal. Not same need for speed (U-Boats). Unthinkable to lay ships up, in present situation, for lack of coal. What wd. U.S. and Allies think! Have accommodated M/F &amp; P. in all sorts of ways, by bunkering in U.S. etc. This is a poor return for all my kindness! O.L. H.G.’s plan wdn’t work. Cancelling export of loco. coal: won’t work because it was linked withU.S. bunkering. H.G. There isn’t the coal – w’out risk which I can’t advise Cab. to take. Gas coal down to 4 wks (vice 6 wks). Falls on rlways, gas &amp; coke overs. Can’t afford any further cuts. 67.000 t. will be lost if, as lekes says, U.S. bunkering can’t go on after Sept.

A.E. Can we get any help from Truman at Terminal? L. If we stop at end/Aug. and U.S. at end/Sept. to supply Europe, it’s a poor look out for liberated areas. O.L. This is too complex for Cab. Needs study by smaller body. H.G. Cd. H.G., Leathers, RAB. and O.L. (Chairman) do this? L. Meanwhile no hold-up of ships. Cab. Cttee { to report to Terminal. - Report in a week. { Then no hold-up of ships. { Exeunt. M/W.T., McC., H.G. { Enter Simon

5. India: Constitutional Issue. India’s internal differences which prevent progress.

L.S.A. Summarised telegram. This breakdown will show – in India &amp; in world opinion – that it is S. Shd. we not issue a statement here? – not leave it wholly to Delhi. A.E. Let India Cttee first prepare the statement: i.e. LSA. to draft and submit to India Cttee.

R.S.H. Shd. we not also see Viceroy’s statement.

S. Let India Cttee meet to-morrow. Tell Viceroy we are sendg. him what we are issuing &amp; presume his will follow ours. L.S.A. Ours must follow his. S. Then you must ask him. Note: A.E. wants to see draft. S. W. wants approval today for paras 6 &amp; 7.

S. a) Cab. agree – brkdown. must be ackd at yr. mtg. Saty.

Do we agree to para. 9. I doubt if para. 8 was right. If it has broken down, shd. he have these private mtgs. A.E. Fear he will have seen them. b) Cab. wd. have thought it better not to have series/interviews meanwhile. O.S. Cd. you complain if interviews were used as in para 8? S. c) Tell him we are puttg. out statement. Afterwards agreed: L.S.A. &amp; S. vice India Cttee.

6. Ceylon: Constitutional Problem.

Cttee constituted as in brief. Rpt. to go to Dpts. D.O.T. vice B/T.
