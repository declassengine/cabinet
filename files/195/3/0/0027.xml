W.M. 52(45). 25th April, 1945.

Stockholm Telegram. P.M. Must tell Stalin statim. Nothg. but simult. surrender on all fronts to all Powers. Only ques: shd. we delay for a few hours to consult U.S. Think not: inform U.S. &amp; Soviet simultaneously. But I cd. telephone to Truman: telling him we’re bound by separate Treaty with R. not to make separate peace.

This is too big for Ike.

J.A. Points to be worked out e.g. surrender of G. navies etc.? &amp; forces in

Norway, Denmark, Yugoslavia, Italy etc.

What’s needed is for Himmler to tell all G. to surrender to local commanders, &amp; be treated as p.o.w. To whom do they surrender in Norway? To local resistance movemt. In Denmark to the Danes. “to representatives of N. Govt.” M/L. N. Govt, have some repres in N. P.M. Too far: easier to fly someone over from here. Genl. agreemt: fly people over rather than risk surrender to Quisling Mayors. We shd. send someone too - &amp; to Denmark. Read draft telegram to Stalin. J.A. ? Add: nothg. to prevent any mil. formn from surrendering at any time. this is an approach from a central authy. Must therefore deal with 3 Major Allies. P.M. Will say this to Truman. C.A.S. May Eisenhower be told? Wd. P.M. invite Truman’s concurrence in our telling him? P.M. Will tell him. C.A.S. Wd. U.S. C.O.S. accept Himmler’s offer – or advise U.S. Govt. to that effect. Wd. you then be in diffies with Truman for having sent this message at once to U.J. P.M. The R. wd. certainly regard that as bad faith. We are pledged to R. not to negotiate separate Armistice.

At this point P.M. spoke to Eisenhower on telephone (from the Cab. mtg.) - read out to him the telegram from Stockholm and P.M.’s message to Stalin. Explained that Himmler was representg. G. State - thus a matter for Govts. not for Eisenhower. E. agreed: a matter for Govts. P.M. agreed to have it read to E. at dictation speed. P.M. W.O. to fly copy over to Monty. (for his own informn &amp; keep it dark) – for the knowledge might affect his plans. P.M. “Nothg. in above telegr. shd. affect release of our orations on the link-up.” To be added to telegram.
