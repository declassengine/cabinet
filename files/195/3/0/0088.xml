C.M.5 (46) 15th January 1946 1. Man Power. P.M. 1.510.080. released from Services by 31/12. Congratulations. E.B. Unfortunately short-fall of 500.000 on munitions. Cd. P.M. see Supply Ministers before Def. Cttee meets on Friday. A.V.A. Admr. reached its target. Figures for division betw. naval and merchant bldg. are v. misleading. E.B. There will be heavy criticism. If figures inaccurate, officials shd. consider.

G.A.I. Publicity – I will make statement in H/C in first week. 2. Greece. E.B. Proposals ready to put to Gk. Govt. in agreemt. with Ty. etc. If we cd. get economic posn. straight, we cd. afford to w’draw Forces after

elections – long term economy.

If Gks. refuse, we can publish – and show what we were ready to do. 3. Poland. E.B. Discussed plan for liquidated debts etc. Pol. Govt. have declined the offer. We must leave it as it now stands.

2. Greece (cont’d)

H.O. Sceptical. May have thrown away £10 m credit. Hope not. E.B. Gives them £25 m. behind their currency. Shd. give them a fair chance. 4. Turkey. Germs of another war. V. disturbing situation. Not yet ready for Cabinet.

5. Indonesia. E.B. V. Mook not going back as quickly as cd. have wished. Drain on our resources – and diffies. with India. Decided to send Clark Kerr out there. P.L. Supported every effort to expedite clean up in Indonesia.

6. U.N. Organisation : First Assembly. E.B. Beginning to settle down.

449

a) President. I agreed to speak. Byrnes then said promise made to Lye. I decided better to stand to my first choice. Speak was elected. Failure of R. attempt to stop it may show no value in prior private agreement – in this case with U.S. b) Security Council. R. asked for delay, so tht. more time for lobbying. I opposed this for similar reasons. c) Secretary Genl. More lobbying. Decided with P.M. we wdn’t run any candidate – and finally agreed to support Pearson (Canada). I will vote for him, in spite of subsequent pressures. No gt. wave of enthusiasm. Doubts as effectiveness. Not bad thing – of excessive enthusiasm for L/N. Obsession with future danger – lack of confidence in results of war – sobriety – scare of responsibility – feeling tht. few resolns. don’t guarantee peace. All this is reassuring. P.L. d) Govt. Hospitality. Not good : and means of introducing people. E.B. x/. Whole organn. of G. hosp. is ineffective. Needs thoro’ overhaul. Own staff who know these people all too busy. Wd. have paid us to get some of our diplomats or consuls home for these occasions. Most of staffs or Delegns,. are new since war – unknown in Ldn. This is lesson for future – can’t now be remedied this time. T.W. Cd. we not have had “personality” notes. S. Workg. Cttee of juniors who cd. act as cicerones eg use of Air Attachés for (?) Aviation Confce. A.B. Smaller gatherings – each Minister to look after no. of delegates. A.V.A. D.O. did it well last night via Bromby. P.M. Supported idea of smaller parties. E.g. I cd. look after lawyers. E.B. Endorsed x/. Lack of staff.

N.B. F.O. Confce. Dpt. with G. Hosp. cd. manage a) small parties. b) introdn. to larger gatherings. P.M. V. well. Go on with that. Dissect the visitors into groups. N.B. E.B. has earned dividend by standing firm on Spaak. Good Chairman.

450

Also good precedent tht. E.B. and Bryne stood firm on (b) above. Presitge of B. Comm. high. W’drawal of Canada : and of N.Z. y’day : have produced v. good effect. e) World Trade Union Congress.

E.B. I have advised U.N.O. = governmental organn. Govt. repns. can’t therefore delegate their response to others. No objn. to their being there in advisory capacity. Can’t agree to their being put on footing of Govt. delegn. Hope this line will be supported – Parlt. wdn’t tolerate alternative. Agreed. 7. Wheat : World Supply. P.M. Heavy cuts. In our case will mean raising extraction rate. May involve ques. of beer. Specially heavy cuts on Germany. Impossible position – starvation. Have telegraphed to P.M. Australia. T.W. M/F has gone as far with Truman as he can. If we can’t authorise him to accept. T. may cut up rough : end result may be worse.

All we are asked to do is to accept allocns. agreed by Truman.

30.000 (? 20.000) more essential for Ceylon : and 73.000 for S.E.A.C

Allocns. for Ceylon : S.E.A.C. will have to be increased – out of our allocns. Can’t go into details now. Propose accept allocns. and ask L.F.C. to work out best means of utilising. 85% extraction from ½ wd. save 140.000 t. to end/June – at cost of equivalent loss of feed. G.H. Endorse remarks re. Ceylon : Malaya. Position there serious. Rations of rice in Ceylon = ¼ of India. And even worse in Malaya. On these allocns. there wd. be serious starvation. A. Raised ques. of Siamese rice. R.S.C. Explained current position. E.B. Gifts argument postponed. Improvement expected now Treaty signed.

451

Consumer goods will help.

N.B. Concern of UNRRA. Greece : 1700 calories : and heavy cut threatened.

Press hard for para.18. Believe this cd,. be raised – to high level.

P.L. a) Have pressed G/India to give more consumer goods to Siam. They’ve agreed to supply more cloth. Hope we won’t be sticky about finance. India has bn. cut off fr. rice imports Jan/March. Hope will be renewed in 2nd quarter as now agreed. b) Was ready to accept this allocation of wheat if most of it can be supplied early in period. Read telegram from Viceroy – raising addl. 150.000 tons. wh. he considers essential minimum. Because of loss of crops in Madras and Bombay. Must now ask for another 150.000 t. J.J.L. Awaiting firm demands from S.E.A.C. J.B.A. Assumg. 250.9000 to. of coarse grain fr. Argentine and reduce pipeline and supply of back-log 660.000 procured this means 1200 calories. Must face it. Want however assumptions verified. Austria. R. Zone is disastrous. If this allocn. went to Austria and we got our share we cd. maintain 1500 calories. But if UNRRA enters Austria, the zonal barriers will be broken and R. Zones need will be so great tht. B. Zone will suffer. Thus, ques. of policy : shd. entry of UNRRA be p’poned. Wd. mean 800 calories all round. Want Cab to consider a) raising our extraction rate and b) eat less x/. bread campaign – to raise some supplies wh. we cd. send to Germany. P.M. Must defer x/. until M/Food returns. Accept U.K. cut. T.W. Caution re. coarse grains. Effect on animal feed and eventual loss of food. A. Bottleneck of internal transport. What of internal transport in Germany? J.B.H. Re-startg. synthetic petrol plan wd. not yield immed. results.

452

Barnes. Lift from Canada. No diffy. in Jan. Feb/Mar. more diff. but no gt. danger of b’down. Increasg. lift fr. Pacific. Must remind Cab. tht. if we have scarce tonnage in uneconomic way we shan’t get thro’ total p’mmes. No gt. diffy. in shipping fr. Canada. But addl. cargoes fr. S. America only on balanced cargoes. A.B. Cd. we not focus public opinion on these figures. U.S. prposg. to hand back 40 m. tons/shipping to private enterprise.

Shameful in present circs.

We shd. mobilise world opinion – play on U.S. sentiment if we need to. H.D. U.S. extraction rate only 70%. Raising to 75% wd. involve 250.000 t, to June. R.S.C. We must do somethg. ourselves. Raise own extractn. rate to 85% on that peg hand an appeal to U.S. T.W. Don’t do that in absence of M/Food. A.B. Work up feeling in U.S. for “Merchant Fleet”. N.B. Passage in E.B.’s speech at Assembly – followed up by radio publicity – may be there cd. then be a resolution at First Assembly. P.M. Not easy for us to make the running – attack on U.S. Better that one of sufferers shd. take initiative. E.B. We were bitter over UNRRA – U.S. refusing to play Santa Clause any more. Have talked to Byrnes re. serious posn. in France. That is better line. Will talk to Dulles also. Not qua charity but self-interest. The charity line won’t work. P.M. (Approve proposals. Agree (U.K. economies to be considered on return of M/Food. (Approach to U.S. to be considered by E.B. in first instance. UNRRA and Austria : can’t postpone because increased mil cost to us (J.B.H. agreed : thought Cab. shd. know result nd. be to spread what we have into R. Zone). J.B.H. Maximum quantities for G. in Jan/March. Need ½ m. : must have 50% of it.

453

N.B. Cd. I lobby importg. countries re. resolution. E.B. Don’t spring this in U.N.O. Not right way of handling U.S. and wd provoke Russia. Accept this – with mental reservation tht. we can go on pressing them for more when our troubles become more acute.

T.W. Let C.F.B. start it off, when world allocations agreed.

E.B. Wait – French situation v. serious : might brk. in 48 hours.

R.S.C. We must lay the foundns. even for that approach by initial publicity for the facts. P.M. Why shd. U.S. take this initiative? Effect on U.S. might be v. bad. P.M. Hold it over then untl M/F returns. E.B. Give me an opportunity to study means of publicity. [ Exit N.B. J.B.H. Barnes

[Enter Williams]

8. Publicity Services in South East Europe. E.B. As in memo.

P.M. Will this fit in with projected organn. for takg. over M/I. overseas services? E.B. Yes. H.D. Lookg. for economies here – cop. in B. Council. S. Air Miny. Publ. Relns. Branch cd. throw up some personnel in Class B. E.J.W. Need for air transport help. E.B. I’ve fixed that with M/CA. E.B. I will see tht. mil Vote goes down pro. tauto. x//. Undertook to answer on Thursday P.M. query re. time at which M/Inf,. overseas services will be taken over by F.O. Memo approved. [Exit Williams : Sargent] 9. Creation of Life Peers. A. Shall soon be asked for our views.

454

Wd. be of gt. advantage to us to have some Life Peers – many of our people unwilling to take titles.

Women – only 3 wd. be affected at present. But legn. wd. be necessary. Third proposal I’ve already told Cecil is impracticable. Wd. welcome views of colleagues. P.M. First ques. links up with H/Lords. as a whole. I’m against anything wh. strengthens H/Lords. J. I favour first 2 : and am against 3rd. I wd. say in H/Lds. this is inappropriate moment to raise these issues. because of all manifold ques. before us. H.D. H/Lds. = our potential enemy. When we fight them, we must beat them. x/. We must therefore keep H/Lords as irrational as possible, so as to make it easier to get rid of them. E.W. This Govt. shd. accept 2nd of these points – remove an insult to the sex. Recommend legislation. Genl. feeling among women. T.W. Where is the feeling about this? What class of women? A. Supported E.W. Let Cecil do it. Say if H/L. agree to his Motion on a free vote we wd. introduce short Bill to give effect to it. P.L. Labour Peers are also to x/ : we aren’t raising it. We shd. put ourselves in the wrong by obstruct. 2nd point. A. I wd. submit memo. explaining position. C.E. Don’t object to 2nd point. Opposed to 1st because want to do nothing to strengthen H/Lords. Conservatives will continue their traditional policy of ruling the country thro’ H/Lords when in minority in H/Commons. Agreed : (oppose 1st and 3rd proposals. (accept 2nd on initiative of others. A. to ascertain in first instance views of H.M. the King. 455
