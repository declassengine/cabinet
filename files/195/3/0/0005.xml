W.M.30(45). 14th March, 1945. Parliament. Remarks of M. Stokes M.P. P.M. Surprised speaker allowed Stokes to say what he did. Propose not to allow this to pass. Will have “earliest opportunity” to-day to raise point of Order. Shall ask that be withdrawn. Have told Ch. Whip to ascertain when I can raise it. L.P. Can raise it following day, as a point of order. World Food Supplies. P.M. Saw Mr. Rosenman – impressed by frugality of our meals – admitted that U.S. are eating more. L.P. &amp; J.A. We have seen him &amp; rubbed this in. M/F. Position is gloomy. Meat: we had the basis of agreement – we to eat into stocks, they to reduce their consumption. W.F.A. ready to play, subject to leaving alone the War Dpt. Now U.S. M/F. has turned round: won’t cut theirs &amp; won’t have anything exported in 2nd quarter. We know State Dpt. &amp; F.E.A. disagree with him. P.M. Don’t release the 25.000t. of corned beef to Russia. M/F. Sugar – W.F.A. are postponing decisions. Meanwhile they are continuing their heavy consumption. P.M. 450lb. p. man cpd with our 300lbs for their Pacific scale is outrageous. M/F. That applies to their troops at home too. W. We are supplying meat from Australia for U.S. troops in Pacific. Shd. we not begin by saying we must have this if they will send none to us. M/F. 360.000 U.S. demand fr. S. Doms. was by us reduced to 187.000. Diffy. of our posn is tht. from our sources 400.000 tons 8.00.m.lbs. of meat 1.200 tons from i.e. we are getting from U.S. 1/3rd more than what they get from our sources. State Dpt. &amp; F.E.A. are arguing now with W.F.A. This the time for for an approach by P.M. to F.D.R.

J.A. What now of our Argentine position. M/F. Believe Argentines are not now so keen …………. M/Ag. Maize: meanwhile Argentines have burnt much. P.M. Food has to take priority over operations at this stage of the war. Record. Agreed: M/F and Cherwell to provide material for telegram. U.K. Stock Levels. M/F. We ought to widen it up – to cover all consumption levels. L Posn changed since Yalta. Hopkins ill: no follow-up. Also problem is now supplies not shipping. U.S. realise this. Apprd y’day a high-level Cttee to consider when they can cut down. J.A. Cut down whom – them or us. The posn seems obscure from latest telegrams ……………….. M/F. Wheat stocks by end/ May here will be at minimum level. When St. Lawrence opens, M/W.T. will have to be asked to rush in wheat ships. Plenty of wheat in U.S., but diff. to get transport. P.J.G. Arrivals in N.W. Europe will be weeks behind schedule. Either rations in those areas will have to be cut (L.P. hardly possible) or there will be another raid on us. P.M. Wd. sooner cut the rations &amp; have a world outcry – comparing with U.S. levels if need be. We can’t surrender our stocks. M/F. Calories 3.800 for U.S. civil popn overall. 4.546 B. soldier. 3.000 B. civilian 2.000 liberated areas – target level. L.P. Does P.J.G. mean serious delays for lib. areas. P.J.G. Deliveries up to mid/May: time lag of 3 wks in move to U.S. ports. 1250.000 cut to 772.000 for later period. And this is sanction only, not a guarantee of delivery. Ch. This includes provn for Germany. Cdn’t that be cut? L.P. 1/3rd is for “displaced” persons. P.J.G. Don’t repeat that now. For it means driving us into famine. There is bound to be famine in G. next winter.

600.000t. a month for civil affairs asked for by Shaef. 1600 cal. p.d. to 40.m. Must include a lot of Germans. Only 2/3m. “displaced” will come into our zone. O.L. Wd. be bad tactics to cut down procurement. We want to leave it high in order to force U.S. economies &amp; get the food. We will control later wtr. G. get it. L.P. W’out firm allocn to lib. areas, they will suffer at expense of keeping quiet those in immed. mil. zone. P.M. Anything we cd. do is a drop in the bucket. We will not starve our people in the hope of doing some good. L.P. Debate next Tuesday. What do I say on prospect of supplies coming fwd. from U.S.? Do I tell the world there will be crisis? M/L. Cdn’t you say something to shame the U.S. people? Make it clear that only their sacrifice can stop the suffering. O.L. Repeat the primary truth – we live on imported foods: can lend only if we import more. Ch. We are v. near distributional minimum which we agreed with U.S. We cdn’t spare more than 10% of stocks &amp; what wd. that do? Distinguish betwn wheat (shipping only &amp; temporary) meat &amp; sugar. In 1944 U. Nat. consumed 15m. tons (meat). Prodn &amp; consumptn in balance. U.S. then cut pigmeat prodn by 1m. tons. (because lack of feed) Arranged U.S. cut consumption 155b – 138b. = 1m. 150.000 stocks. We 300.000. Now 600.00 (twice) extra demand for Services &amp; liberated areas. Thus must put to F.D.R. choice: cut either Services = lib areas: or own consumption. If your civilians won’t make sacrifice you must face the posn tht. either Services or lib. areas must go short. Stocks. Phil Reed. not now coming over. M/Ag. We want wheat from U.S.- as well as liberated areas. J.A. Shd. P.M. warn F.D.R. in telegram that we shall be havg. some Plain speaking in debate Tuesday. P.M. Balancing wtr L. or O.L. shd go to Washington. Now tht. shipping is not main problem I think O.L. shd go, taking M/F &amp; possibly Cherwell &amp; sending for L. if shipping comes to the fore. - Agreed. a) Draft statement for F.D.R. 1.000 words.

consumptn increased while ours decreased. absurd to judge us (importing country) by cond ns. {include refce stocks are insurance v. catastrophe &amp; can’t be {to Ministers’ reduced below level prev. agreed as minimum {visit. necessary for distribution. refuse reduce stocks: wd. sooner cut rations – with publicity involved. demands made: priorities – mil. lib areas &amp; Germans only if any remanent feel bound to compare relative rations of U.S. soldiers and B. civilian (4 times): bringing out comparison with heavy manual workers. Cd. you not postpone the debate: &amp; indicate tht. these are some of the facts wh. we shall have to disclose in debate. A.E. All arranged. Housing: Thurs/Friday. P.M. Put that off until followg. week. M/F. Better perhaps to defer disclosing these facts until after O.L. &amp; I have gone out. L.P. Awkward for me to wait on lib. areas. P.M. Some proportion: proposed tht. I shd. send a shattering telegram to F.D.R.: if succeeds, he will give an impulse - &amp; in 3 days or so some effect will appear. Before our Ministers go, want an answer for the Debate: a genl. indication before going into details. For this reason wd. like to defer debate for a week. A.E. I will see what can be done to arrange postponement. I might take housing earlier. Warning to Germany. P.M. Read draft telegram to F.D.R. O.L. Add reference to fact tht. there will be a v. serious shortage anyhow. P.M. Obj n raised by F.O. They will begin to starve our p.o.w. &amp; other foreigners. I propose to put the cons as well as pros to F.D.R. &amp; U.J. Ch. Don’t put too much stress on sowings – applies to using up stocks. P.M.. But that wd. drive them to starve p.o.w.

Food Supplies (resumed). W.P.130. (iii) + (iv). M/Ag. Want to tell my Cttees in confidence of facts. Want to tell public also in raising volunteer labour for harvest. W.L.A. Gratuities. P.M. When C.D. blown over: we might do somethg e.g. coupons &amp; keeping greatcoats.
