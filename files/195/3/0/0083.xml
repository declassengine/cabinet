C.M. 65 (45) 20th December, 1945 at 4.pm. 1. Moscow Discussions. Worthy 39 &amp; 40 handed to all present.

P.M. Diffics. Atom at end/Agenda &amp; Persia not on Agenda at all because M.

linking it with Greece etc.

Treaty Procedure. R. thesis interested Powers propose &amp; others call in to sign. We have opposed this. Doms. &amp; all smaller nations will dislike - &amp; might refuse to sign. We have told F.O. not to give way on this. Agreed. P.M. Next, which states shd. come in? Those wh. have taken action part in war v. State concerned. M. objects to incldg. India because not Sov. State: &amp; says if India then Baltic States shd. be included. B. ready to sacrifice India. At. S. Fran. compromised by admittg. Ukraine &amp; Byclo. R. E.B. inclined to admit B. States to get India in. Don’t see how we cd. accept India’s exclusion. Doesn’t matter much if we admit B. States. Don’t care about Byrnes – he’s always letting us down.

Suggest therefore support inclusion of India: give E.B. free hand re Baltic

States.

A. Applc in ’44 we promised to consult Doms. re admn of B. States. N.B. India internat. entity since 1919. Has dipl. repres &amp; makes own Treaties. We cd. argue India is far beyond U.K. &amp; B. Russia. If we must in end recogn. B. States somethg. to be said for havg. them in now as units of U.S.S.R. A. Our agreement. with Doms. was, when U.K. &amp; B. Russia were brought in, tht. we wd. consult Doms. before admitted any more as units of U.S.S.R. P.M. Let E.B. consult Dom. repres in Moscow. Insist on inclusion of India. Give E.B. free hand re Baltic States, subject to consultn with Doms. thro’ repres at Moscow. [Enter Buchanan.

2. Control Council for Japan.

P.M. One to represent. Austr. object. A. We’ll never get 2. Let’s be content with 1, &amp; let it be Australia.

Agreed. 421

3. National Health Service Out of room for 30 minutes. A…… G.P. Service.

e)

f)

P.11. Charges by specialists. Don’t know how far Minister will be able to

go. I wd. like to require spec. to be well paid &amp; prohibit them fr.

takg. paying patients in nursing homes. Need to stop nursing homes

tied to Surgeons. Have instead paid beds in hospitals. Aim shd. be

to stamp out nursing homes.

Danger of allowg. drs. in pbl. service to take private patients. Condn tht. drs. shd. work at Health Centre, put in specific hrs. of attendance. Lead to full-time service – but agree not to force the pace. Ancillary services. Diff. to get proper developmt., w’out more attractive system of recruitg. &amp; traing. nurses. health visitors etc. A.V.A. How then wd. you avoid compensation. Some homes are owned by doctors. A.B. Squeeze them out by creating better service. Don’t prohibit them. A. General scheme – v. ingenious. Misgivings re G.P.’s – make basic salary as large a propn as possible and work twds. elimination of private practice. H.M. Expd my views earlier on hospitals – and Cabinet took the opposite view. This memo. follows that decision. No point therefore in my saying much now. Para. 5. A big list. Much adminc diffy. Dilemma: run as State instns &amp; local initiative cannot be allowed. …………… Out of room again……….. Finance. v. big figures. Taxpayer pre. war paid only £3.4 M. Goes to £115.3M. Insurance Fund goes up also. These figures will increase – esp. with local adminn with little control. Discussion. Unwise to throw this at heads of l.d.’s and give them no time to argue. A battle with all l.a.’s plus the other interests is v. serious. And this = field of service wh. is traditionally l. govt. You will be forced to give them time. Face the facts therefore. Waste of time to begin drafting before negotiations are at an advanced stage. Danger of blocking other Bills. Propose therefore tht. drafting be deferred until after further decns of Cabinet. Want to go on record – as apprehensive re amount of opposition this will attract. H.D. Broadly in favour of scheme 422

But para. 53 admits estimates of costs are only provisional. Must therefore reserve my posn on finance until closer estimates ready &amp; we can also see linkage with other things eg. block grant. Present estimate envisages gt. rise of Exchequer expendtr. [Exit Shinwell] Coaln W. Paper £54 – 132. M. Committed therefore to all save £13M. Diffce; however is big switch from rates to taxes. Cdn’t therefore be commd until I can relate it to block grant. Awkward redn of my mass of manoeuvre on the block grant. Ask therefore tht. no financial dicn be taken until I can report on block grant. Must also consider whr. we shd. tone down amount of compenn to doctors. Para. 10. We are commd to Nat. Service. Don’t want too much rope therefore for Reg. Bds. Nat. Budget must be retained. Any local excess wd. have to be appn centrally. Also wd. have to institute comparative costing. Means central direction intervention and meticulous control. Reg. bodies will be spending national money.

Broad lines are right: but can’t accept financial implications at present.

G.B. M of S. S. supports this scheme subject to pts. of difference.

b) health centres. We wd. run by State via l.a.

Don’t expect opposn fr. l.a.’s – for main l.a.’s now controlled by Labour.

On convalescent &amp; nursing; homes we wd. like to go further than M/H.

P.L. R. Infirmary Edinb.

G.B. Support H.M. completely.

In this world it will provoke opposn.

[Exit Addison] G.N. In Scotland we have run 3 State hospitals for 40 years &amp; we don’t share L.P.’s fear on this ques. Differences: a) ambulances. We wd. attach to hospitals. c) regions. 5- of wh. Inverness wdn’t be linked to teaching hospital The opposition in Scotland will come mainly from vol. hospitals. And H.D. won’t get away with his attempt to link this with revision of block grant. There will be combined l.a. opposn to hospital proposal. Scheme is bold &amp; imagination = &amp; in a perfect world wd. command support. E.W. We are commd as a Party to some scheme for a Nat. Health Service. This is the best scheme so far. 423

It gets over the main medical objn – viz. against being put under l.a. Reg Bds. shd. go far to meet l.a. objns to Whitehall bureaucracy. Important tht. Cab. shd. approve this in principle before negotiations begin. Coalition scheme was put fwd. inviting criticism. The well paid dr. put up his objns as tho’ on behalf of profession as a whole. P.M. On finance – we must have report from Ty. A.B. Finance is contingent on genl. principle of scheme. It follows fr. them.

G.A.I. Increased contns in N.H.I. scheme wd. be easier to get over if we cd. say

improved Health Service is coming along.

J. Start on Bill.

A.G. Disagree. Don’t want to waste draftsmen time.

H.M. We want to know about progress of negotiations. Report on that at same

time.

What of cost of alternatives – e.g. pumping money into vol. hospital. P.M. Apart fr. bulk sum, how will it be raised? Much of this = income tax. H.D. It’s not the total – it’s switchover to taxes. A.B. RE opposition. Here is our chance to do something big. Are we to sacrifice that chance for fear of parish pump? But unless I have firm support of Cab. I’m beaten from the start. A.B. Must get on with this Bill if we are to meet N.H.I. dates. Don’t want to postpone prepn of Bill until we see results of negotns. Those modificns needn’t affect Bill, which will be in general terms. P.M. X/ First let us see Heads of Bill – so tht. we can see what is legn &amp; what is adminve action. T.W. Better spend time in negotns than more in Standing Cttee. Premature prepn of Bills doesn’t make for rapid progress in the end. P.M. Agreed: repeated x/. A.B. Does that mean we can’t have Bill this Session? H.M. Can’t say that yet. A.B. Cab. trying to do too much. What will Cab. discuss on the Heads of legn? A.B. Can’t agree to Cab. reviewing heads of Bill - &amp; modifying them in light of opposn. 424

It will be only in detail that I will give way.

A.B. When I start these negotns I shall make up my mind to concede nthg.

H.D. And no promise to be held out of any alteration in rate burden.

P.M. Want to see how much is legn &amp; how much Regs &amp; adminn – want to know extent of Bill before we finally decide whr it shd. go fwd. this Session. H.M. i) A.B. cd. begin negotiation with l.a.’s. } pari passu ii) A.B. cd. begin preparing instns to Counsel. } Cab. cd. perhaps consider (ii) in light of (i). A.V.A. Concerned at Cab. approvg. separate schemes on merits w’out genl. picture of total budgetary posn. Concerned re taxation yield. Bonus to be a drop from war-time levels of yield. Ty. shd. put Cab. a general picture of total commitments &amp; possibility of revenue to meet them when war-time yields drop. H.D. Rehearsed the various commitments. V. broadly, every time you raise social expend’re you reduce chance of any further substantial tax redn in this Parlt. If this is a rush &amp; not a steady pace you may be able to balance the budget

at end of this Parl. – but w’out any tax redn.

P.M. We must discuss soon how much of a man’s income we can spend for him.
