W.M. 46(45). 16th April, 1945 (6.p.m.) 1. Migration. Cr. Draft agreements – now acceptable to Australia. Canada, N.Z. &amp; S.A. not forthcoming. Australia = only Dom. offering to play. a) One outstandg. point: relation of B. &amp; Aust. ex-servicemen. Prefce to Aust. ex-servicemen for 7 years: wd. place B. migrants at serious disadvantage. b) Another: on the other agreement. Assistance twds. passage money. Beg C/E. to reconsider. Don’t discourage Austns , who are only Dom. who have tried to meet us on this. May have lasting effect on their attitude. Won’t cost much because small nos. L.P. Take a) first. Awkward for us if we sent them out &amp; they had to return. M/L : P.J : W. in favour of pressing for equality. H.O. Not keen on sendg. our best people away – on a declining population. Cr. Not v. serious. In 3 yrs. pre-war more people came fr. Doms than went there. On (a) agreed to press Australia to agree. J.A. On b) wh. applies to non-service passages. Ex-servicemen get free passages. Sympathy with H.O. views. Earlier migration policy took a/c of Eire. Diff. for me to proceed as tho’ £10 to-day = as big a contribn from the individual as pre-war £11. We (Govts.) shd. be paying more than twice pre-war rate. Wdn’t insist on 1/3rd of total cost – but somethg. more than £10. L.P. { What will be paid for wife of ex-Service man. x/ { J.A. { I wd. be ready to make a concession for dependents of ex-Service men. Cr. (At request of C.O.) Australia are askg. for Maltese. They cdn’t pay more than £10. On x/ EEB. ascertained that free passages extended to dependants of ex-Service men. J.A. Wd. settle at £15 if Cab. impressed by D.O. arguments. P.M. Do we want to encourage migration? We want population.

Cr. But Australia must increase her population Don’t think v. large nos. will go. P.M. What about preferential rate for women, of whom we have too many. S/S Air. From R.A.F. pt/view – trained in Doms. anxious to know of facilities to go back &amp; settle. Can’t alter our policy. Rather go forward e.g. &amp; get some agreemt. with Canada – at least on facilities for R.A.F. men to re-join wife married in Canada during training. M/L. Want some B. stock to maintain the race in Australia &amp; other Doms. That is the basis of this scheme – facilitate those who want to go. J.A. Ask the man to pay £15. Cr. Australia may call it off then. J.A. They can’t dictate what we shall pay. Their financial posn is better than ours. P.M. Against increasing the incentive to migrate. Cr. Then I will close with J.A.’s offer of £15. On (b) agreed at £15. M/L. Then also efforts to reduce the farce. Get it down to £45: then it will be 1/3rd each as pre-war. 2. Harry Pollitt. Proposed Visit to Finland. H.O. Conference opens 17/4. We wd. allow people of other colour to go. Refusal of exit permit wd. cause Parly. row. We won’t give priority for air passage, however, &amp; he won’t go even tho’ exit permit given. Are we to maintain in Parlt. that this is a pol. Party whose members will be treated differently from any other? P.M. Wdn’t mind making out a case for so maintaining. H.O. He can’t get there w’out special priority for air passage. It is still a lawful political Party. R.K.L. Cadogan on 7/4 wrote to Pollitt saying tht., without any priority, F.O. wd. do their best to provide travel facilities. H.O. That is a reason for granting the exit permit.

R.K.L. “Our best” won’t get him to Finland now! W. Why not say: can’t provide travel facilities: thus no point in giving x/ exit permit. Agreed: as at x/. 3. President Roosevelt: Memorial Service. H.O. Favour tolling the bells. Ready to issue Press notice at once. A muffled peal will be tolled at St. Paul’s at end of service. Govt. hope, wherever possible, ring bells at 12.15 p.m. M/L. Cd. you ask employers to let it be broadcast thro’ the works. B.B. V. late to arrange it now. Agreed: { M/I. to do what he can on “works” point: not { to be more than 2 minutes of b’cast bells. M/I. not to do this if it will be untidy. 4. Organisation for Military Government in Germany. P.J. Clear now tht. 3 Zones will have to be administered separately for long period. a) adjust arrangements to that conception b) appoint the Deputy who will have to function. c) give him dirns for period betwn V/E day &amp; full centralised machinery. P.M. Why did we agree to this v. unfavourable Zone? P.J. At Quebec Confce. We wanted the sea-ports in N.W. Germany: or at least keep U.S. out of it. This carried with it the objns of takg. over food deficit area &amp; devastated at that. M/L. On the memo. – a Mil. control: but wd. ask P.J. tht. mil. shd. have more civilian aid subject to their control. Afraid wrong kind of G. helper may be taken on, by mil. w’out advice. Add fr. Control Cttee civilians with experience who can advise on industrial side. P.J. That is the intention – civil staff earmarked. J.A. Para. 7. 1st sentce = ambiguous. - As in note passed to P.J. P.M. We have responsibies save security of our Armies until all resistance is over.

Commns will be restored etc. R.K.L. Cont. Commn can operate only after agreemt. of all. Day-to-day adminn can’t readily be run like that – as E.A.C. has shown. P.M. I wdn’t take over our Zone, outside own mil. posn, until all resistance ended &amp; agreemt. reached e.g. on supply of food to deficit areas from surplus areas. Meanwhile, let U.S. sort it out. This memo. omits a stage – in wh. we are responsible only for area in wh. our Armies are operating. 3-power agreemt. on food in Germany first. M/L. You’ll want the proposals in Memo. even for limited area occupied by our Armies. P.J. Whether for Zones or for occupied territory, must be period before central machine begins to function. Important therefore to appoint the man i/c &amp; let APW. tell him how he is to run whatever area he has charge of. P.M. V. well: agree on basis tht. extent of territory = what our Armies hold on V(E) Day. M/L. Viz “B. occupied area” vice B. zone in para 5. P.M. Area occupied by D. on V(E) Day. And add para. Negotns with U.S. &amp; R. for sharing equally betwn. G. popn in the 3 Zones whatever food is produced in Germany before we move to take over prescribed Zone. P.J. Then tell C-in-C. stand fast on ground held of V(E) day until f. notice. P.M. Agreed. P.J. May we proceed on assumptn tht. Monty will be appointed? P.M. Certainly - &amp; talk to him. P.J. And announce it soon? P.M. Yes – stay where he is until thinks begin to settle down – 6 months or so. Agreed: P.J. to submit draft announcement to P.M. 5. Occupied Holland. attitude of Germans. No circulation record. P.M. Gerbrandy at wk-end. Recent visit to Nijmegan. Underground movemt.

in Holland estabd contact with Seyss-Inquart. He proposes: he &amp; Genl. Busch will defend themselves so long as G. Govt. &amp; Army to which he is in duty bound remain. Best method of resistance is to blow the dykes – because small forces can defend the high ground there remaining. Per contra, they offer “if you can defer further attacks on us until G. Govt. is over, we will surrender. Meanwhile we will facilitate Red X. entry into Holland: fire no further shot etc.” Alternative. We cd. threaten them – they are in a trap. They wd. be treated as war criminals: &amp; they know they wd. be caught. Have drawn a Memo. on the alternatives. Telegraphed the informn to A.E. as he can discuss personally with U.S. &amp; Russians. Prime facie disposed to let it be sealed off until G Govt. go down. Wd. release 2 Divns. for Lubeck/Kiel area. S-I says he’ll to it anyway, wtr higher G. authy agree or not. Circulate the telegrams at once, w’out waiting for memo on conversation with Gerbrandy. [Enter L.S.A. &amp; H.F.C. 6. Empire Telecommunications. J.A. Studied since June last. Cttee agreed save Ld. B. Can’t leave it alone: for promised full consn of Anzac plan. Doms will expect now we’ve had it for months. Bs. C &amp; W. v. strong – much more than U.S. competitors. 30 m. capital but 200 m. assets. Speciality of Press rates. V. efficient. Attack made by C.C.C. – stimulated dissatifn in U.S. who don’t like pref. rates available to B. subj. only. No reason for brkg. up the Co. – save tht. Australia wants it. S.A. &amp; Canada don’t want to partake in cent. control. Break this down when trying build up integrated Dom. Services e.g. in civil aviation. We lose central influence: also revenue. Urge delay: bring in C &amp; W. ask about their strength &amp; prospects. J.A. Ty. fear C.O.’s posn precarious – partly because competn air mails, w’less telephone &amp; partly because determn Doms to maintain services. Austr. &amp; N.Z. combined to put fwd thro’ C.C.C. plan for break-up with no central body. Result of Reith plan wh. includes central authy - only dissent being Can. &amp; S.A. who want to attend only as observers. C &amp; W. obv. doubtful of their future: for they’ve proposed convn to p.u.u. with State subsidy. P.M. Will this scheme of yours require legn.

J.A. Yes. But next step wd. be consultn with Doms. at Ministerial level. B. C &amp; W. say plan put fwd. on compulsion. J.A. They don’t believe they can maintain their posn. B. Cables becoming more popular. Cr. B.’s idea “intrigue on C.C.C.” Deeper than that. Doms. dislike central control fr. Ldn. on Dom. affair. In this, partly by a private co. The Doms. are not prepd to go on with this. They wd. break away &amp; make separate agreemts. &amp; Dom. scheme wd go. R.’s scheme is acceptable. Doms. are as least united in disliking B.’s scheme. L.S.A. Agree with D.O. Dominatg factor = need for rapid &amp; cheap dissemination of commns through Doms: not necessarily obtd thro’ private company. Have followed this since started C.C.C. while at C.O. If we reject both R. &amp; Australin plan, risk is tht. Doms. will break away from C.C.C. &amp; no Dom. cohesion at all. R. did well in getting so large a measure of inter-Dom. agreemt. W.s Will each Dom. take share-holdings? J.A. Interlocking companies – but Can &amp; S.A. won’t agree to be bound by decisions of central body. B. S. Africa &amp; Canada don’t want it. Australia won’t want more. P.M.G. Agree with Cttee. Rpt. Diffies have lasted for years: this is best way out. R. done much better than we expected. Doms. can bankrupt C &amp; W. at once by continuing the W.T. circuits establd during the war. Pre-war C &amp; W. didn’t pay standard dividends. Since war they have because of war-time increase. In long run cables may become cheaper than w’less. But will take 15/20 years to put the new cables in. B. Rate of cable transmission has bn. stepped up My suggn is tht. Cttee shd. now consult the Co. J.A. We have done, at official level. Their estimates for future are pessimistic: and their own proposal is for formation of p.u.u. B. Well let R. scheme be put to C &amp; W. &amp; their views be invited.

J.A. Next step wd. be to invite Dom. repres here to discuss whole situation. We’ve delayed that – for they had put up proposal we didn’t like. Various pts on R. scheme not yet discussed with Doms. P.M. Then say HMG. have given genl. approval but not reachg. hard &amp; fast decns until heard what Doms. have to say. And C &amp; W. shd. be allowed to express their view. J.A. Of course. W. Why not bring them in first? J.A. The Co. was set up for Imp. purpose: has relations with all Govts: somethg to be said for Govts talking first. P.M. V. well: I’m not supporting that point. Confce won’t be over before this Govt. ends. The concln &amp; certainly the legn will be for another Govt. &amp; Parlt. L.P. Agree with Conserv. colleagues on Cttee. A.S. Serv Dpts to be brought into Confn. Agree: provided we’re not committed. { no legn in this Parlt. { Co. consulted at proper time. B.B. a) Best news-service in world. b) U.S. jealous of their efficiency. In war, team has broken down: cables have proved more reliable. J.A. ? a) Summon Confce. b) Tell C &amp; W. Give them Rpt &amp; ask their comments. P.M. Yes: subject to making it clear we’re not irrevocably commd. Cr. That will be posn of everyone who comes to the Conference. P.M. Add to b). They can have facilities to appear before Cttee to put their case orally.
