will take longer – but Fr. haven’t bn. told.

[Agreed. at x/

War Crimes.

P.M. Trouble because de G. wishes to send warship to take one battn in &amp; two out of Lebanon. Can’t stop first lot going in: object to re-inforcement. Situation changed: no need now to use Lebanon as training ground for We shd. now urge Fr. to conclude Treaty with Syrian Govt. after wh. we will withdraw our troops if Treaty provides for ‘w’drawal of Fr. troops. Meanwhile wd. it not be wiser to avoid sending in troops. P.J. Arrangemts. in train to w’draw combatant troops – adminve troops P.M. V. well. I mean to tell them. Their attitude determined by fear we are going to stay. x/ First want mtg. with C.O.S. + O.L., M.A.P., P.J.G. to review posn in light of changed situation. M.A.P. Say at same time D.L./de G. agreement is at end.

liquidated anyhow.

P.M. Cd. you negotiate with e.g. Himmler &amp; bump him off later.

P.J. Buchenwald is not a war

S. I prepared a statement of objns to trial procedure. Gave it to Cadogan. But see his later views as at Annex C. Esp. para. 2 &amp; 3. Situation has changed: if we can’t agree on procedure for leaders, let us get agreed procedure for the others. The leaders are being H.O. Quite entitled to do so. And trouble if he isn’t – Head of Gestapo.

crime.

P.M. Don’t quibble: he cd. be summarily shot, in respect of some of those in the camp. P.J. Diff. to ask mil. courts to try crimes primarily v. Germans. R.K.L. 3 types a) war criminals for industrial Govts to deal with

b) intermediate – Belsen Commandant: heads of Gestapo etc. Rosenman’s idea: membership of crim. conspiracy. Main diffy. there = intol. burden on occupying authy: also (P.J.: crimes v. Germans). Propose A.E. { shd. favour provided administratively { practicable. { U.S. to work it out, as they suggested it. c) Criminals with no geographical location – de facto the leaders. U.S. &amp; Russians both intent on trials. We have argued &amp; make them change their minds. Prefer not to say: most of the leaders have gone: put the rest into a) or b). May be competitive claims by diff. countries to same man: but procedure cd. be devised to handle choice betwn.

competitors.

1) Position changed by liquidn of so many of the leaders.

6 out of 8 Italians in our list have gone. M.A.P. No reason why you shdn’t bring them all into the conspiracy issue under (b). H.O. Wd. it help with U.S. to run the arraignment idea? A.G. Tried: but no effect. M.A.P. Suggd to Smuts arraignment + right of written reply only, with no later hearing. S. That really moves further away from U.S. preference for trial. R.K.L. Handed in draft. P.M. Don’t make a big fight with U.S. &amp; R. on this. We are in weak posn . Say 2) if that is their view, we won’t oppose in principle: provided before giving our final assent they put it in concrete terms. 3) Class (a) above can be dealt with. M.A.P. More for a single trial of the lot on conspiracy basis. M/L. Put MAP. point interrogatively? W. Leave it to them. R.K.L. A hint wd. get them moving that way. P.M. I wd. rather see their plan. Don’t want to put them off.

S. Remind AE. of previous W. Cab. decisions. a) no treaty b) mil. courts. But on c) major criminals: situation changed: but tho’ we see diffies don’t resist their views. P.M. x/ Willing to add – fewer trials the better. 4) Misc. war criminals in Germany – mil. courts : agreed subject to to solution of adminve diffies. Belsen etc., - tried by mil. courts when directions given by Allied Powers to give them jurisdiction. M.A.P. In lieu of mixed mil. ct., prefer the mil. ct. of the Power in occupation of the Zone.

Fed from various sources –

P.M. The mil. ct. – sweeping up remainder. a) ordin. war criminal b) selected members from condemned categories. e.g. Gestapo – who can’t be handed to a particular country to deal with. On this instns will have to be worked out for mil. courts. The internatl court wd. only deal with the few leaders in the various categories. P.J. Procedure for mil. courts. Changes - B. mil. courts a) relax rules of evce e.g. admit hearsay. b) nos. to concur in death sentence. c) new penalties: flogging, confiscation. P.M. Put that to Cab. Ministers who’ve bn. dealing with these ques. S., M.A.P., A.G. [Agreed.
