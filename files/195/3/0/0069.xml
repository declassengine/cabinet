C.M. 51(45). 8th November, 1945. 1. Industrial Injuries Bill. A.G. Mtg. with I.I. Group. After 2 hrs. passed resoln tht. they wanted the Bill &amp; agreed not to press their amendmts. to a Divn. Wd. have bn. unwise to ask them to w’draw them from the paper. Agreed also tht. if Opposn oppose w’drawal of an amendmt. they will vote with Govt. 2. Parliament: Next Week’s Business. H.M. Read out Programme. Nothing for Cabinet. W.W. Friday is thin. N.B. suggests grant for UNRRA. – might be debated so tht. Govt. can announce intentn &amp; we can bring in Suppl. Estimate later. E.W. As there is unwanted time couldn’t we use it for “as &amp; when” Bills? H.M. Leg. Cttee must authorise first. Can’t quarrel if H/C. despatches leg. business to get more time for Adjournment. Not only 2nd Rdg – other stages wd. require time. H.D. Thursday: after Procedure: I will move – a) Sel. Cttee on Member’s expenditure. b) resoln on 3 leg travel for M.P.’s A. Travelling exp. for H/Lords. Memo. sent to H.D. Will t. of r. for a) exclude H/Lds. H.D. Yes: H/C. only. H.M. Week after: 2 day debate on f. affairs: will be on 21/22 Nov. if convenient. E.B. Yes. But ready to put off for another week if P.M. not back. And shd. be so postponed. That shd. be watched. b) Private Notice Question on Leakage re. Hospitals. P.M. W.S.C. is asking a P.Q. to-day. What does M/H. say? A.B. Have enqud. S. Pictorial first. No leakage fr. my Dpt. so far as I can find. Cab. pp. penetrate deeply into Dpts. for wh. I can’t be responsible. Also wide knowledge of our views. Also vol. hosp. have bn.

flying kites. Say H/C. must await decision &amp; announcemt. by Govt. A.V.A. My Junior Ministers complain tht. they hear of Cab. pp. from others. P.M. I will send round a note – warning of need for discretion. 3. Site of United Nations Organisation. E.B. As in memo. H.D. Repeated earlier argument in favour of U.S. location in order to keep U.S. in the Organn. Gt. objn to return to Geneva – lost hopes. Won’t press my U.S. view if F.O. strongly opposed to it: but if Europe hope much thought for alternatives to Geneva. E.g. The Hague, Oslo, Copenhagen. E.B. History is v. that argument. U.S. brgth. into Europ. affairs largely thro’ joining I.L.O. and extension of U.S. travel in Europe. After hearing arguments, I’ve concluded balance/arguments in Europe. Agree don’t press Geneva: suggest all European alternatives be explored. P.M. Supported this F.O. view. E.W. UNESCO. – don’t want to go to U.S. (cdn’t afford it). French pressg. for Paris. U.S. wd. agree. But shd. U.K. take the line tht. it shd. go wherever UNO. goes? P.M. Argument for not havg. all internatl organns together. H.M. .. the other way because need for integration. A. Doms. consulted. Evatt only one to take def. line – in favour of U.S. Massey &amp; M. King attach importce to lobbying &amp; publicity if in U.S. They don’t want any N. American site. They don’t like Geneva however. S.A. don’t favour U.S. N.B. Evatt’s view is based on view tht. Pacific will be centre of world affairs. Nonsense. U.S. will say nothg. publicly – but State Dpt. believe best way to beat isolationism is to have U.S. coming to Europe. All organns is one place: argument of integration is strong. Also common services: resident Press. E.W. Appeal v. that view. Advantage of taking these gatherings round. P.M. Support Europe: all alternatives be considered. On UNESCO: don’t tie all organns to one place. Compromise – some 332

shd. be in same place, not all. H.M. Let subsidiary siting be considered in light of genl. rept. on all – by F.O. H.D. Para. 13 is a bit out of line with view of Cabinet. H.M. Doesn’t matter where conferences held: but don’t decide tht. H.Q. can be scattered. E.W. Freedom now – we cd. come into line later. N.B. The strongest case for separate H.Q. (i.e. away from general) is that of education. But broad principle as H.M. – offices in same place, tho’ confces can go round/ E.B. Too many organisns anyhow. Let tempy H.Q. be anywhere – but w’out prejudice to genl. decision. [Exit N.B. Enter Wilmot 4. International Control of Atomic Energy. P.M. Didn’t want to get at once into detailed ques. of policing the bomb etc. Wanted first to talk on basis tht. this discovery alters whole basis of world peace. Para. 2 is most important. Real aim shd. be to get behaviour right – then bomb won’t matter. Scientific basis – genl. knowledge. In a few years everyone will know how to make it . Industrial use – at least 10/20 yrs. ahead. Moral: get together with U.S. &amp; Russia &amp; others &amp; develop U.N. conception. Don’t believe in a) genl. agreemt. not to use it. b) we cd. use it to threaten others. U.K. is in most unfavourable geogr. posn. c) agreemt. tht. we wd. use it v. anyone who first used it, wtr. aggressor or not. Start therefore on basis can’t regulate this w’out world good will. Logic of situation i) no secret wh. can be kept. In time can be developed widely by nations. ii) therefore effective world organn is only remedy. H.M. How do we go? Assume no./countries will make &amp; hold a. bombs. We must do so ourselves. Agreemt. v. aggress. warfare is old problem: only new thing: nastier weapon. But still have the fear tht. someone won’t play &amp; must therefore be prepd for bad faith. Let Intern. Org. prohibit their use. No good however unless you let it be known at once tht. anyone who brks. faith will be forcibly suppd if need be by means includg. a. bombs. Open ques. wtr. a. bomb must be used for this purpose.

Does P.M.’s memo. p.3. lead back to disarmament mistakes of inter-war years? Failure then was merely hoping people wd. behave, with no power of effective sanctions. P.M. Danger: isolate a. bomb &amp; deal separately. Logic is: outlaw all war, much more than ever before. A.B. Sense of security essential prelimin. to readiness to disarm. P.4. (f) R. will say “thanks for nil”. If true tht. R can make in a 2 yrs worth dramatic gesture – give it them now. If mutual confidence is basis of peace we shd. not only declare but ensue it. Attempt to restrict this to a few countries will brk. attempts at U.N.O. Must take some risks in attempt to create feelings of mutual confidence. P.M. We’ve given R. everythg. during war: &amp; received nothg. Little return from giving things to R. R.S.C. This is peculiar case. In 10 yrs. R. will be able to make it. Won’t make much diff. if we tell them – might reduce it to 5. Ques. is therefore of tactics. Shall we rule this out at once as a power politics factor &amp; let everyone have it at once. Believe, if we are running policy of moral basis vice power politics, first need is to do this with the a. bomb. E.Sh. x/ in (f). R. may be suspicious of Anglo-U.S. intentns &amp; reluctant to discuss world organ. unless a. bomb included in it. Doubt if we’ll get anywhere by approach as at x/. Wd. prefer to modify that, in order to remove R. suspicion. Agree they aren’t playing ball. But suspicions founded on pre-war experience attitude of capitalist countries. a) Wd. like to offer the bomb but link the offer with discns themselves. b) I assume small country cd. make this. Prs. a Fascist country, like Spain. Need therefore for U.N.O. to promote democracy. P.M. Suspicions on both sides. U.S. are suspicious of R. Both sides have cause for suspicion. E.B. Worried about this memo. because all related to a. bomb: and this is only one of a no. of nasty weapons. Risk tht. conversns will turn on a bomb unduly – and leave e.g. R. to go ahead undisturbed with other nasty weapons. Vice (f) As soon as UNO organ. &amp; accepted give it function of examing. &amp; recommendg. means of exchanging informn re fundam. scientific research &amp; all new weapons. Wd. be in keepg. with war-time agreemts: the reservation clause might have to be modified. Wd. like some specl. machinery of U.N.O. to deal with this. Such an arrangemt. might put U.N.O. on its feet.

R.S.C. A Scientific Genl. Staff attd to U.N.O. – comparable to Mil. Staff Cttee? E.B. Whose findings shd. be common property of U.N. P.M. Wd. like to move in tht. dirn. Diffy about diffce between scientific discovery &amp; know how. Not (in reply to A.B.) to R. alone: China, Argentine, &amp; others wd. have to have it. Want to lift this away fr. a. bomb to genl. powers of destn. Welcome E.B’s suggn. E.B. Where an invention has peaceful use ………. Wdn’t remove (f) – but wd. supplement it. (f) = situation we now face. My suggn is goal to which we work. R.S.C. We have enough arms now to keep world in order. What we want is to prevent competitive race in terror quality of new weapons. If we can stop that – competitive drive for terror weapons &amp; we can later disarm other weapons. A.V.A. Some inconsistencies in P.M.’s memo. Para. 10(d). Public opinion will aspect one: &amp; you will need one. Para. 10(d) is inconsistent with some arguments used in para. 6. Hope you won’t exclude fr. yr. mind possibility of convention. Fear of Ldn’s vulnerability – same thing brought down L/N. sanctions because France feared. Conventn re gas has had restraing. influence. (Disagreemt. expd.) A.B. Main anxiety – argument betwn U.S. &amp; Russia. Let G.B. mediate: and let our view be known. Rally round G.B. the nations who fear this hostility betwn. U.S. &amp; U.S.S.R. Agree with much of what E.B. has said. R. is frightened. Pride based on R. Army: &amp; a. bomb has wrecked it overnight. We must get at the state of mind wh. is behind R. suspicion. P.L. One aspect not covered. Unlikely anyone will start by dropping an a. bomb. What is likely is: a Power will want to do somethg. at expense of small neighbour: &amp; will use threat of a. bomb to secure its ends. What is to be our posn in that case? We cdn’t protect Danzig – only attack Germany. That only gets into war, leadg. to destn of civilisation. A.B. With universal awareness of weapons, we shd. avoid situation in wh. an aggressor can rely on weapons which others haven’t got. P.M. My objn to Conventn (AVA) is tht. it is delusion to suppose you have done anythg. by getting that paper protection. That is my only

335

point. You may have Conventns: but they alone won’t protect you: must be part of U.N.O. &amp; good will &amp; knowledge. R.S.C. Remember that scientists are serious in their view tht. they will not hold their mouths merely because they are told so by Govts. E.Sh. In discn of atomic energy when it comes remember my Dpt. P.M. Consensus of view – clear enough. Grateful to Cabinet. Points raised from U.S. – my view a) Genl. discns – not agenda. b) No submn of document. A.G. Let it be known tht. U.K. took initiative in this - &amp; mean to keep it. [Exit Wilmot. [Enter Shawcross. Buchanan Adam. 5. Man Power: Release of Doctors from Services. P.M. Service-men being healthiest shdn’t require highest ratio. V. unhappy over this. What were reasons adduced by Service chiefs? A.V.A. They have duty of maintg. healthy &amp; effic. force. Even in 1929/33 4 per 1.000 – in days of direst economy. In war, with added risks, 3 per 1.000. Insufft. time for me to consider this further cut recommd. This recommn wd. make it imposs. to maintain standards in Navy. P.M. In 1929/33 no shortage of drs. Cut made solely for financial reasons. Now we are at end/war in wh. gt. sacrifices made to Services – wrong now to compare with 1929. I can’t believe tht. this ratio is needed now war is over. Immediate posn is what must be considered. C.E. A.G. and I enqud: saw civil Ministers concerned: repres of Serv. Dpts., junior Ministers. On our recommns we provide for civilians under ½ ratio given for Services. Our concln: main need for protn at present = civil popn. Competing claims on doctors. The Services have got them. Our recommns won’t get us up to 1.p. 1.000 for civil popn. Even with this cut, nos. comg. out as g.p.’s will leave only 47 p. 1.000. So many of them want to get out into specialist practice. On comparison of ratio’s, there is case for larger cuts. But smaller packets - &amp; high accident rate in R.A.F. make higher Service ratio justifiable. J.J.L. Protest v. late delivery. I only got this y’day. 336

P.M. Circulated 8.a.m. Tuesday. S. We don’t like this – but will accept it. J.J.L. Potentialities this winter: epidemics. P.M. But risk is even – civilians as well as soldiers. A. Supported memo. True: small packets: but also large numbers. Civilian risk is much greater. Ratio in Army is excessive and always has been. R.A.F. lowest average ratio, &amp; highest casualty rate – willing to accept this cut. H.D. This memo. = moderate under-statement. Don’t understand why ratio in peace shd. be any higher than civil. Take this cut. But go further. Take census of how much time drs. in Services spend in medical work. A.B. Obliged to C.E. &amp; A.G. This has bn. going on since July. And Service Dpts. haven’t yet carried out instns of W.S.C. A bit much therefore to say not enough time to consider memo. E.B. Agreed. Glasgow 1. to 3.000 } Districts where v. hard work is Greenock 1. .. 4.100 } being done. H.M. Service Dpts. must adopt these decisions &amp; give effect to it. } report progress week by week. } J.J.L. Under Class A or B? A.B. Under A mostly. Agreed. H.M. But get them out, one way or another – para. 13. [ Exit Adam. Shawcross. 6. Organisations Influenced by Political Party: Attitude of Govt. Dpts. C.E. Diff. to have absolute ban while Communism is still legal. Ministers shd. exercise discretion. H.M. Was arranged during war tht. Ministers in doubt shd. refer to Home Secy. who wd. decide, subject in need to reference to Cabinet or P.M. Convenient tht. this arrangement shd. continue. Agreed: as in H.M.
