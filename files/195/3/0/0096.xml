C.M.13(46). 7th February 1946.

1. Parliament. P.M. Shd. C/Exch. Spk. In Food Debate on d. eggs issue? H.D. Alloctn. to Dpt. detail is for response Minister w’in his own p.mme. Watch Oppn. tactics. Recently d. eggs held up to ridicule. Don’t take in isolation. Remember how unpopular cuttg. films and tobacco wd. be. How much can we say to H/C. either as to our dollar posn. or how we manage these things. P.M. Is it fact tht. M./F. has had to reduce because of overall allocation? H.D. Everyone has. B/T. equally on tobacco. EEB. Offl. Cttee – B/Payments – deals with import p’mmes on all dpts. Virtual agreemt. at offl. level on rept. now on its way to Ministers. 271 out of 500 for food. P.M. What was basis for maintaing. films and tobacco and cutting down on eggs? H.D. Gave information – from his brief. We cd. spring another 6.000 t. H.M. If disagreement this wd. have come to Cab. Cttee. M/F. wd. have bn. wise to bring it up anyway. H.D. £16,800.000 films. £35.m. d. eggs. over recent period. H.M. We shd. settle Spkers. for Thursday. [Enter B. Smith] E.Sh. Cd these facts be disclosed to Cabinet even if not in public? A. Need to tell people about things sooner. Food shows it. Why not do the same over consequence of not getting the loan. Bias in favour of telling more. P.M. Might stimulate tobacco and film lobbies to support the loan. D.S. Bank doesn’t advertise when its going broke. Run on flour now. Wd. have bn. a run on d. eggs. A. I’m not talking of d. eggs. I’m thinkg. of our capacity to buy. 496

T.W. Get the Debate on the basis of World situation as a whole – don‘t let d. eggs be a red herring.

P.M. x/ Let policy be worked out by Ministers and reported to Cabinet on Monday /x. P.L. Statement on India? P.M. No need to decide yet. [Exit W.W. Enter: Barnes. G.T &amp;Wilmot] 2. Man Power and Economic Survey. H.M. Complts. to Steering Cttee. includg. Econ. Section.

This is a survey not a set of recommns. for executive actions. Based on informn. derived fr. economic controls. New sources will have to be substituted. Now being broken into quarters and projected in 1947 – also provisional picture for 1950. Man power and income deficit of 1.3m. men and nearly £500m. Clear we cdn’t have maintd. defence at level requested. Hence redns. in Service demands. Even so a gap will remain. And redns. are for end year: need to reach those figures as early as we can in the year. Need for firm priorities in investment projects. Distribution trades: need to prevent their being over-manned. Considered publn. in due course they shd. But a) this is experimental and b) we can’t say what our planning machinery is. Therefore am proposing shorter statement as in para. 11. R.S.C. P.26 clothing : assumes 70 coupons at end 1946. In fact it will be much less. Will report on that to Cabinet. E.B. Man Power Rpt. Main trouble : nos. on munitions. Believe even 650.000 is too high. Now propose (on my own) further redn. to 500.000 – in the light of CP. 40. Wd. affect civil aircraft : i.e. wd. enable men to be put on their prodn. and save dollars. This redn. wd. mean Services wd. have to go w’out new supplies for a year or two. But that may be a positive advant. in enabling them to get more up to date equipment later. J.W. Existg. p’mmes. based on Def. Cttee decisions. Redn. then will reduce labour force. We must maintain minimum for war potential – and we are down to that now on tanks and a.a. guns. Swing over to c. aviation is now moving fast. Tudor II produced in record time even if delayed on time-table.

P.M. I’ve told Service Dpts. to rely on stocks : make do with what they have. R.S.C. Use surpluses and relieve pressure on that. J.J.L. Bear in mind our respons. for clothing and equipment. Allies now with us. P.M. Which Allies? J.J.L. Poles. P.M. What others – give me a report. J.J.L. Greeks. P.M. But on surpluses surely. Agreed aim : live on surpluses, save necessary research development. H.D. Supported reduced target of 500.000. Leave Service &amp; Supply Dpts. to work out how they share it. G.A.I. Distribution – covers more than shop assistants. Also deliveries. Easement for housewives. B.S. Supported this. But control of margins is reliable

P.M. Appeal to women and older men.

E.Sh. Men over 65 are being sacked from mines. There is also no discipline in

the pits – ca’canny. May be better to do away with E. W. Order while

retaing. guaranteed work.

R.S.C. We must have some limit. Studying how. May be only thro’ margins. P.O. War. 585.000 demanded. Repatriatg. 145.000. 283.000 being brought in (para.7(iv)) from Germany to U.S.A. Contacts with T.U’s v emplt. of p.o.w. Some Unions which are takg. p.o.w. are thinkg. of pressure on other Unions to do same. Scheme for enablg. men to go temporarily to other areas fr. devl. areas, with liberty to return when more emplt. in home areas. Large scale check (200 firms) on munitions industries returns. Not satisfy. tht. figures are reliable. How will you control distribn. of man power? How many engaged in non-essential services – sports, cinemas? T.W. Problem = inducements, so long as man power is short in more attractive occupns. 498

E.Sh. P.A.Y.E. is working ill – losing last day of week – pays a man to go off for 4 wks. after working 40. Am puttg. somethg. up to C/Exch. on this. G.T. Take case of geograph. aspect of appeal to women. P.M. Publicity : need for organised plan. Let H.M. be responsible, with F. Williams in charge of official group. Start with statement by me in H/C. Hinges largely on Service strengths wh. can’t be disclosed in advance of Def. White Paper. H.M. Will put up my para. 11. draft statement next week. P.M. Shd. be a general b’cast.

Agreed : H.M. to co-ordinate.

Conferences addd. by Ministers. G.A.I. Arrangements in hand for conferences with labour : employers. P.M. Fix that up with H.M. No unilateral action by M/Labour. E.B. Conference with T. H. Executives must be private – no Press. P.M. Control of investment projects. H.M. x/ Need for economy in Govt. Depts. esp. on economic controls. P.M. Need for proper priorities – eg. in roads. H.D. Look at it Regionally : for man power posn. varies. Accept that principle. P.M. Steering Cttee to devise machinery for effecting control. R.S.C. Re x/ we can’t administer w’out eg typists, which we haven’t got now. E.B. How long can you go on freezing Civil Servants? H.D. Must do so for some months. E.B. Typists’ wage in C. Service is much too low. I had to pay 25/= a wk. to supplement C. Serv. wages of typists transferred from Union. Agreed : C/Exch. to enquire. E.B. Civil Service : Bad accommodation : Bad welfare works no amenities : no

study of lighting : canteens are a disgrace. Can’t run Socialism w’out

proper staff. When D.R. 58AA goes, there be a rush out. And Orders aren’t

a substitute for our doing the right thing. Get C. Serv. listed as an

unattractive occupation – and turn on the Factory Insprs. Make a 5 year

Plan.

499

H.D. Cd. we have Cttee – M/L. and M/W. to help? P.M. Yes. P.M. Your para. 11 statement. How can you do it while loan is outstanding. H.M. Difficult – not impossible. R.S.C. Can base it on need even if we get Loan. Bad enough even then. P.M. How? In H/Commons? H.M. Yes : in H/C. and b’cast. P.M. Approach Opposn. to see if they’ll play. Let H.M. do that. E.Sh. Technical enquiry into increased efficiency in industry. We believe in mines we may in 10 years make do with 100.000 less man power. R.S.C. 15 workg. parties will produce somethg. Trying to run “efficiency service” from B/T. want to expand that. J.W. Agreed Nat. Council for Motor Industry – techn. efficiency will be part of that function. Same procedure will be followed in other parts of engineering industry. P.M. Must be done industry by industry. But cd. be applied to food – transport. G.T. Doing it in building – bit by bit.

3. Timber for Housing. R.S.C. Loss of pre-war sources, Russia and Finland. M’while Sweden important source of supply. Realise little chance of U.K. coal. There is, however, some chance from U.S. that wd. mean no bilateral deal and timber wd. go into a pool. E.C.O. Timber sub. Cttee of E.E.C.E. meeting together to work out a scheme to get it for someone. Can’t do more than hope will get some. Supply fr. Germany. It’s filled : problem transpt. Will get it eventually : difficult. Not much before May ’46. Linanton’s view. Yugoslavia (in reply to E.B.) – team coming over to discuss.

E.B. See Karddj. while he is here : looks more co-operation. Monty Meyer wd. be willing to build saw mills there. Wd. like U.K. in there on trade basis. R.S.C. Other chance : Roumania. Timber there filled and ready for Swiss : we’re trying to buy it from him. U.S. have brought large part of the R. business in timber.

We may just squeeze home if Sweden and Germany provide what we want in 2nd half ’46. Best bet : some from Soviet. Have seen Soboliev Vyskinsky. Must, however, get war trading accounts cleared up first. Told Soboliev I wd. go to Moscow if they really want a settlement : then we cd. get some timber. D.S. Trade wd. open up some food exports from these countries.

R.S.C. No. C.C. lack of man power.

G.T. Suggest more negotns. on use/timber until we are sure of supplies. J.W. Worried about suggn. of using home gr. timber to bridge the gap. Wd. prefer to see German used. More from Germany. P.M. See Para. 4(a) of R.S.C. memo and what R.S.C. has said this a.m. T.W. Ag. Ministers suspect Germany has never bn. asked for timber. R.S.C. Reason is C. Commn. had so much to do tht. this cdn’t be organised earlier. It’s being speeded up now. H.D. Think C.C. might have done better if they’d thought as much about exports to us as imports of food.
