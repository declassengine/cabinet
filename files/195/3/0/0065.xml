[Enter M/F., M/W.T. and Hynd] 4. Europe: Food Supplies B.S. Second 112.5000 t. to go: instn given this a.m. in view of Monty’s latest wire. 14 wks. supply in U.K. stocks. Feeding to cattle in U.S. – no reply for 3 wks. tho’ prospect favourable then. Hence sent the 112.000 t. as one month’s supply. Further supply bound up with a)feeding to cattle b)stocks minimum in exporting countries! Next problem: supply to March: Monty’s bid raised from 5 to 8.00,000 t. H.M. 600.000 t. in 1939. Now 1.700.000 t. And will be there at end /45. G. &amp; A. needs 225.000 to end ’45. Not therefore easy to be too rigid. E.Sh. Adverse effects on coal prodn in Ruhr. if M/F original proposal stood. J.B.H. Original demand 225.000 t. on 1500 cal. Ration. Posn deteriorated. Thought only 112.500 now released. Want 275.000 at once to get up workg. stocks. Plus 132.000 this &amp; every succeeding month. Otherwise rations will drop by 40% of 1550 cal. Essential therefore not to wait for agreement with other countries. Ask for urgent examn &amp; taking risks on our own stocks. H.M. That is asking too much. R.S.C. Monty’s telegrams are v. grave. We can’t turn him down on guess-work. We shd. send someone out to check the needs. 225.000 B.S. I am prepd to meet original demand for ½ /m tons by end/December. E.B. Then case must be made out for any increase if necessary. P.M. Let 225.000 go fwd: and L.P. Cttee consider the position &amp; Frame recommns x J.B.H. to investigate &amp; submit recommns to L.P. Cttee. E.B. L.P. Cttee shd. decide whtr addl. demand to increase or to make good short fall before the agreed estimate fixed. Agreed at x/. [Exeunt M/W/T. &amp; R.B.H. Cadogan] 5. Food Policy T.W. On p.2 “producer” vice “farmer” to cover fish. 304

Accepted. A. Thought this was settled - &amp; said so in H/Lds. the other day. Settled Labour policy. But this statement doesn’t say M/F. will be consld H.M. Ques. of Dpl. demarcation not yet settled. If we say it goes on, we may be asked supplementaries you can’t yet answer. P.M. Someone will ask. You can’t dodge it. You can say you are sorting out consequentials. A.B. Why is it necessary to say this? M/F. = shortage expedient. After shortages, proper dept. for health policy is probably not M/Food. All that is necessary now is to say M/F. will be required for a long time yet. T.W. Our policy on this is fixed. E.B. P.2. 3rd para. Add some reference to equitable distribution on removal of controls. Pre-war diffy. was not scarcity but distribution. P.M. Covered by opening words of next para. A.G. This is important, dicn of policy can’t have it dragged out on supplementary. Every reason to put it in the body of the statement. R.S.C. Add “For this purpose M/F. will be consld” at end of first para. Agreed. H.M. Omit last para. Agreed: subject to this addition. [Enter P.M.G. Exit M/Food] 6. Empire Communications H.D. As in memo. H.M. Points of detail, e.g. basis of compensation, will need considn. H.D. Yes: as soon as decn of principle taken conversn can go ahead. H.M. Defence pt/view. H.D. C.O.S. agree. A. Will raise small point fr. Canada with H.D. Agreed

[Enter S.G. Exit P.M.G.] 7. Parliamentary Procedure H.M. As in memo. Want some liberty of action - wdn’t mind differing from Cttee on some point. S. Rpt. Stage of F. Resn. Can keep debate going if you haven’t a majority. H.M. Askg. Cttee to proceed with fin. procedure – ask them to review this with the ques. as whole - Agreed, Debate on Clause stand part. Not prs. worth pressing. A.G. Addl. L.O. Against that. But para. 3 a) &amp; b) shd. be adopted. S.G. Think b) wd. be convenient. May be necessary to modify tradition that court work of L.O. shd. take precedence over pol. work. Agreed – accept a) and b). L.O.’s reduce their court work. Approved: subject to points noted above. 8. Circulation of Memoranda Prepared For Parliamentary Labour Party H.M. Wd. like an understandg. that Ministers shd. bring such memoranda to notice of Cabinet or Cab. Cttee. – when there may be a diffce btwn. Ministers &amp; a group of back-benchers. E.B. Better to incorporate it in Minister’s own memo. P.M. Agreed – more constitutional. Agreed: on this basis. 9. Statement by Minister of Education E.W. Explained how invited to speak at revolutionary club. Spoke on Trade Unionism. Asked them to consider consequences of strikes – “might even have bread rationing”. Didn’t know Press there – except for one man. He sent in the stuff - &amp; Press blew it up. Apologised. 10. Dockers’ Strike G.I. No change this a.m. But believe strikers are now seeking a way out. Left M.P.’s are askg. Govt. to intervene. Have promised mtg. w’in 24 hrs. of their return to work. Similar approach from So’ton. Pr. Notice Ques to-day – same line, non aggressively. Will repreat “offer”. Must stand on posn that they must return to work first.

T.W. Any informtn re sums of money being recd by unofficial strike leaders? G.I. No official information of this. C.E. My offrs. have discovered no evidence of anything “political” in this strike, or any “hidden hand”, G.I. Grimsby Ballot 50/50. 358 to 360 : verdict against return to work. E.Sh. Cd. you promise that negotns after ths. mtg. wd. be completed in reasonable time? Men may feel machinery is slow. G.I. Have guarantee fr. both sides to meet w’in 24 hrs. And I will say we will watch the posn. Cd. add tht. we will impress on them need for avoiding delay, - if desired. E.B. This is the fastest Union machinery there is. Want to protect the Union. Deakin is taking v. courageous line - &amp; will prob. lose his job. It’s a straight fight: let him carry it through. Labour Party must not intervene. M/L. must not promise quick results fr. negotiations – look at diffy. of the issues to be negotiated &amp; the interests against decasualisation. This is first crisis over change down to peace. A.B. Don’t accept as generalisation that members of Govt. shd. stand wholly aside. Unoffl. strikes sometimes caused by incompetence of Union Officials. Must I do nothing, if blders strike! P.M. M/L. is i/c. Ministers can help him if he wants their help: but only then. E.Sh. Wd. not be inconsistent with E.B.’s view to indicate some hope of speed in negotns.
