 C.M. 52(45). 13th November, 1945. 1. Nationalisation Proposals: Public Announcement. H.M. Summd earlier Cab. discns – considd by interested Ministers &amp; L.P. Cttee. P.M. agreed I shd. make statement in his absence. E.Sh. Para. 2. line 2: “will” vice “intend to” line 6: “the Govt. intend to introduce” measures. A. Paras. 3-4. Country carrier not affected – is it worth makg. it clear. R.S.C. Does this cover priv. firm running own haulage? A.B. No. R.S.C. Make that clear too. A.B. Mainly A licences. Cd. clarify in subsequent announcemt. Will hold Press conference. Better than incldg. it in genl. announcement. Wd. overload it. H.M. Must be briefed for supplementary on this. A. Bev. Risk of restrictg. ourselves for whole of this Parlt. H.M. Not completely rigid: but dangerous to go outside “Let us Face Future”. Need for makg. intentns clear for industry must know where it stands. A.Bev. Cement. Increased use: might have to take over. H.M. Cd. be done on merits if diffy. developed w’out taking control. E.B. Para. 6. Concerned at leavg. this for examn. Docks are “interest- controlled” shippg. cos. etc. Docks pre-war never worked more than 27% capacity – for lack of national plan &amp; orderly developmt. Enorm. capital cost crippled efficiency. Hope there will be national scheme, tho’ Regional control. Mersey D &amp; H. Bd. not so hot, nor even P.L.A. Services – pilotage etc. Will you do anythg. on this? River under- takings. R.S.C. x/ Add “and appropriate ancillary” after “harbour”. E.Sh. Pilotage &amp; charges, yes. But what do you mean by “ancillary”. Road services covered already. R.S.C. Lighters, tugs, wharfage, warehousing.

E.Sh. Lighters takes you into shipping – composite undertakgs. Words better as they stand: consider how far you then go. R.S.C. No: for “d. undertakg.” is a legislative unit &amp; doesn’t cover any ancillary undertakg. A.B. Prefer words as they stand because addns will draw fire &amp; divert discn to the fringes. Agreed as at x/. A.B. Para. 6. lines 3 &amp; 4 delete “comply with …... efficiency ….. interest”. Suff. covered by followg. sentence. Shipping strained durg. war &amp; will be in diffy. post-war. Can’t give them special support because commercial policy. Agreed. E.Sh. Coastwise. Refce is too vague. Must decide one way or other. I favour takg. it over. If you decide to contrary, better say so at once. E.B. Take over liner coastwise tonnage – amalgamated &amp; ready. But small concerns on varying business you can’t take over: sometimes coastwise, sometimes cross-Channel. H.M. Our view was: gt. deal being covered (rlways, road haulage, road passenger, canals, docks &amp; harbours). Better not to touch shipping at all. E.B. Liner coastwise is v. like Class A road carriage. A.B. Started with idea of takg. over: came to concln we had better leave it out. H.M. Say so: “while not proposed to take over c. shipping will be nec. to integrate it with inland transport.” Or – omit all reference. Agreed. A.Bev. Para. 7. This was in our programme. This introduces note of doubt. J.W. My view = favour of publ. control. But rpt. havg. bn. asked for &amp; due w’in a week. We shd. be open to criticism if on eve of rpt. we indicated closed mind. A.V.A. Country has given mandate in favour of p. control, but rpt………. A.G. Add word “final decision. Agreed. J. Paras. 8 &amp; 9. Diff. to read together. H.D. Intentn was tht. final sentence shd. be substituted for penultimate sentence.

339

H.M. Both points ought to be made i.e. both 8 &amp; 9. Are both points made if penult. sentence is omitted. E.Sh. Prefer to omit 8: will be misunderstood. It’s all in 9. R.S.C. Diff. pt. V. important. Must fix date as fr. wh. compn payable. Give notice now. Add, however – “except as stated in para. 9. ……” J.W. Last sentence of 8. unnecessary – throws further doubt on iron &amp; steel. H.M. { Make it clear refers to all undertakgs. mentioned. { Omit 2nd sentence of para. 8. &amp; penultimate sentence of 9. { Amalgamate the 2 paras. Para. 9. Line 5. “progressive undertakgs” vice “industries”. Agreed. Date to be decided by H.M. Prob. Wednesday. [Exit Barnes &amp; Wilmot. [Enter Smith &amp; Fraser. 2. Agricultural Policy. T.W. Accords with Labour Party policy. B.S. Accept it. Diffces of view on detail now reconciled. M/F. shd. be repd in discns with industry. T.W. Yes. E.W. More emphasis on vegetables, particularly near towns. T.W. Doesn’t need such long-term measures. A.Bev. We are concerned re impure milk. Bovine t.b. sharply increased durg. war. U.S. soldier forbidden to drink our milk. 16% infected. Intend to submit memo. Notice to T.W. E.W. How long shall we subsidise wheat? Normally can get it so cheaply abroad tht. isn’t fair to subsidise it. Green veg. &amp; fruits shdn’t be so dear: wd. be better to subsidise that. T.W. Wheat was never basis of our agric. Always was a limit. Must be so because rotation. Price already reduced for ’46. Never our intn to force up wheat. We are going rather for livestock. Re fruit: v. large market. But, save for few apples, our produce is gone by Xmas. A. This is mainly marketing – vegetables need no subsidy if that is met. Requiremt. on landlords re equipmt. will need developmt. later. 340

J. Bar to efficiency: one farmer owng. land wh. shd. be farmed by another. T.W. No power. Dynamite. Thousands of adjustmt. by sale. Can’t do more w’out natn – save by persuasion wh. Cttees exercise now. A.Bev. Cd. M/Ag. &amp; M/F. &amp; B/T. examine marketing of vegetables? T.W. Two years ago asked for post-war scheme for marketing. Have it well in mind. Agreed this shd. be followed up. T.W. Pure milk. What about condns in U.S.? Bldgs. wd. cost £300 m. – to put us in posn to get clean milk. E.Bev. Will have to co-erce farmers in the end. Agreed: Pure milk to await memo. H.M. At end of para. 11. ? add refce to appt compensn. M/Ag. to consider. T.F. Was not in full agreemt. at L.P. Cttee. But now support this memo. This isn’t comprehensive. Deprecate trying to put much additional matter into it. On basis of this we can develop policy. G.E. N. Ireland is satisfied with this statement. R.S.C. Shd. it be made more clear tht. this statement covers Scotland. H.M. Para. 7. of memo. Next Sessions p’mme can’t yet be pledged. No statement w’out authy. Demand for Debate cdn’t be resisted. A. Correspdg. statemt. in H/Lds. Agreed. [Exit Fraser. Smith. 3. Future of Department of Overseas Trade. R.S.C. P.M. agreed: only comment was Cttee of Junior Ministers. H.M. More effective wd. be offls. with Junior Minister in chair. R.S.C. Can be done, this one, by Junior Ministers. Much politics in it. P.L. Proposed transfer of Institute. Burma &amp; to some extent India have made some contn: unfair to put it under C.O. R.S.C. Really a research institute. Best place wd. be under L.P. G.H. We haven’t asked for it. Don’t want it regarded as Colonial. Wd.

accept L.P. Agreed. H.M. Delete Ministerial Cttee on O. Econ. Policy. } } Agreed. R.S.L. Report to Cabinet, not L.P.(I). } G.A.I. Add M/Labour to Cttee. Agreed. M/Ag. to receive pp. R.S.C. F.O. shd. make an announcement. E.B. It is M.G. business. P.M. shd. announce it on return. 4. Sarawak. G.H. Rajah seen – v. much more forthcoming. Wants to arrange cession to H.M. Govt. Para. 4. Consent of Asiatic Members. He is in favour of this: &amp; we recommend it. He wd. like to pay one last visit, himself. I’ve agreed to that. H.D. On finance – Rajah has nearly £1 m. balance. We think this shd. be available for reconstn of the country. He shdn’t. get away with the whole of it. No commitment w’out consultn with Ty. G.H. Agreed. J.J.L. S. is in Australian Command. They shd. be told of visit? A. No comment. Agreed. [Enter Ch. whip. 5. National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill. H.M. Movemt. to raise 45/= to 55/= and 60/= Cab. understood 45/= was limit. Mtg. with group – long discussion – in the end they didn’t press. Now Harner &amp; Lawther are threatening tht. miners won’t work unless they get more. Old story – miners trying to outdo T.U.C. They want to see P.M. Question: a) shd. they be seen i.e. in addn to our havg. seen T.U.C. b) do we stand firm on 45/=. W.W. Told them Cab. wdn’t move from 45/=. T.W. V. awkward if we have to meet sections of T.U.C. after negotiating with T.U.C.. How many more sections will come along? This is one of our biggest measures. Must remain i/c. E.B. As individuals or on behalf of Miners’ Executive? 342

W.W. The latter. H.D. Lawther sits in St. Cttee. Members (incldg. T. Smith) take his instns there. E.Sh. They raised this with me last Friday. I believe the Horner set-up has found they can’t step up prodn &amp; are seeking alibi. Expd on this – also on 5 day wk. At B’pool I said I looked fwd., when output was right, to 5 day wk. Now they raise “short Saturday” &amp; press me v. hard. Have had to oppose it. Believe Lawther, who is in truculent mood, is seeking a point on wh. he can say “that’s why you don’t get prodn”. In fact this has no connn with output. May be good tactics to see these two, to mollify them. Industry = restive. J.G. Said y’day balance of advantage = see them. [Enter J. Gr. Earlier I recd depns (2) from miners repres &amp; reported to S.S. Cttee. Specially desirable to bring out that 45/= is not all the Bill provides. Miners don’t realise what other provn is made in the Bill. G.A.I. Diff. ques. Was against it before E.Sh. met. In T.U.C. strong resentment at sectional groups deputing as well. No harm in seeing them to refuse. If concessions follow other sections will depute gt. trouble with T.U.C. You mustn’t throw over T.U.C. on this Bill A.G. Wd. be wrong to receive miners. Wd. be better to see T.U.C. (incldg. miners). Otherwise we wd. elevate miners to status they don’t deserve. A.Bev. Supported this. In miners’ Union no. of people who manipulate it for pol. purposes. Lawther is only a tool of the Communist element. Positive suggn One diffy. = Communists prominent in T.U. movemt. are preventg. followers fr. ascertaing. facts. Strike last year in mines because men didn’t know terms of Porter award. Ask T.U.C. therefore to consider means of disseminatg. informn to the men: ask them to print a leaflet on Bill &amp; circulate it. H.M. Good idea. And when Bill is passed Minister shd. broadcast. E.B. Support A.G. Miners always worst informed of all workers. Informn service: not enough use made of T.U. journals. Need for Journal for miners now a Union not a Federation. H.M. Agreed this suggn also be considered. E.B. B’castg. time: after 1.p.m. on Sunday is best for miners.

343

J.G. We issued statemt. last Friday – but got v. little space. Agreed: P.M. on return to see T.U.C. [Exit: Griffith H.M. to handle correspondence. 6. Parliament. H.M. Postpone F. Affairs Debate to followg. wk., prob. Thurs/Friday. Agreed. 7. Palestine. Draft statement read out. E.B. I will add a para. explaining C.O. as well as F.O. interest. Agreed. Cabled to U.S. Response not v. good. Telegram read. At least U.S. are in the Cttee. G.E. Statement on immigration to-day. Shd. it precede or follow? E.B. Good effect in U.S. if made same day. H.M. Debate. If demanded to-day will promise announcemt. on Thursday – on business.
