India: Constitutional Problem. their views. Wd. then b’cast explanation in India, simultly with

P.M. Some opinion in Cab. not convinced of soundness on merits of Cttee’s Rpt. Agree that, as Labour Ministers favoured it, adoption might take India out of politics. But we must discuss on merits. Fear a much less efficient Council wd. result – much less representative of intelligentsia in India. Also can’t plead that we shd. have got back to a democratic basis - for it wd. have no elective basis. Cd. even be argued that it wd. be reactionary for all serious issues would have to be settled outside the Council. In short you weaken the Council w’out reaching a democratic foundation. For these reasons, unlikely to find much support abroad – in world opinion. I’m therefore against it. Ques. then arises cd.Viceroy go back empty-handed. “Something must be done” is not an argument for far-reaching constitutional change. Will not be accepted as serious contribution to } constitutional reform } Summing .. lessen influence of Indians on Govt of India } up. .. win little assent abroad. } My solution for India wd. be something much more or much less than this pinchbeck plan. Wavell. Instns when I went out 18 months ago to consider this problem &amp; report in due course. Confce with all 11 Govrs. last autumn – all in favour of a step before end of Jap. war. Some return to Cripps offer: some conference: some elections. Drew up my proposals – C-in-C., Home Member &amp; Francis Wylie consulted &amp; agreed. Fwdd them home in Sept. In Oct. wrote personal lr. to P.M. Had corrce with S of S. for India: at his request consulted Hallett, Colville, Glancy. Hallett (UP) supported: so did Colville: Glancy, favouring a move, feared affect of Muslim League on central Govt. in Punjab. Then asked leave to return for discn at home – Jan., postponed to March, then to June. I pressed to come at once because end/war in Germany wd. be a favourable moment for makg. a move. Also believed capture/Rangoon wd. re-inforce need for a move. Wd. also have liked a decision from Coalition Govt. Procedure on approval. Will consult present Ex. Council &amp; cable Parly. statement here.

Conference a) those holdg. office as Premier on Prov. Govt. or those who last held it in S.93 Provinces = 11. b) leaders of Congress, Mosl. League, Indep. Party c) 2 senior advisers d) Gandhi &amp; Jinna e) Rpve of untouchables and Sikhs. They wd. advise me on membership of new Council, if approved. Total 22: only 9 Congress, 6 Moslem League, 7 independents. Don’t believe they wd. be unreasonable or irresponsible. Believe they

are anxious to for a Govt. wh. will try to deal with India’s

progress in India.

On x/, subject to report to report to Cab., I wd. refuse to enlarge it.

nominating. They wd. prob. split into 2 groups, Moslem &amp;

V. &amp; C-in-C. 4 Congress &amp; 1 non-Congress Hindu 4 M. League, 1 non League Moslem. 1 sched. class repve 1 Sikh &amp; perhaps 1 other Council of 15 only 4 of wh. wd. be Congress Hindus. Wd. ask them to give pledge to support the war. Don’t under-rate diffies - now or hereafter. But all other courses (wieldg. no action) are even more dangerous. We are stuck now: initial move shd. therefore be gradual not drastic. Council intellectually wd. not be inferior to present. More nationalist &amp; diff. to handle: but that must be handled if we are to make They wd. have some popular support behind them – nominated by If they decline the offer, then I wd. go no further – no negotiation. P.M. x/ Suppose they say 22 if not large enough body to consult: &amp; suggest 200 or so. W. Release of Working Cttee – wd. consult my Ex. Council. Patel &amp; Nehru are only diff. ones still in custody. The 22 might seek to diffy., I wd. be ready to release the lot when the discns start. I wd. preside at outset: then wd. ask them how to proceed in Hindus. A.E. Like this better than Rpt P.J. &amp; R.A.B. It is not the same. L.S.A. Yes: it is the working out of our framework. P.M. If the 22 seek to negotiate, wd. you refuse? W. I wd. report home recommindg. refusal. O.S. Quite difft. when Viceroy says he wd. have power to go outside the

nominations made to him – as well as to select from w’in those. But that is not clear from the statement. L.S.A. Yes: it leaves it open to Viceroy – para 12. O.S. What of opening of para. 15.

V. awkward if you were subsequ. charged with breach of faith. Must

P.M. Will they feel any satisfaction if they are told at outset that Viceroy

be made quite clear – includg. power to go outside. L.S.A. Agreed. will be quite free to ignore their recommns. Much less objectionable as now stated – danger of its appearing a “nothing”. W. Believe it will be regarded as an advance. Council wd. be almost wholly Indian: the ptfolios of Home &amp; Finance wd. be Indians. P.M. Don’t want to be pledged in advance to legn on ques of 3rd Member with 10 years experience etc. J.A. Much will depend on extent of desire in India to escape from present deadlock. W. Believe there is much anxiety to get back into office. P.M. We can’t end this discn now. Viceroy has expld his procedural plan – aim to give him surer guidance &amp; broader advice before forming his Council. His ultimate power of selection wd. not in form be affected. This shd. be studied by India Cttee. Meeting to-day with Viceroy. To review draft statement in the light of W.’s explanation to-day &amp; our discussion in Cabinet. When it comes to action, don’t worry about release of detenus. If you are going to release Nehru why boggle over release of the others. Cabinet to meet to-morrow to approve further report of India Cttee. 2. Syria and the Lebanon. P.M. No answer yet to telegram to Truman.

Telegrams from Damascus. Telegraph commn now cut. Second telegram from Shone. Tels. 448 &amp; 455 Damascus. These read out by E.E.B. Can substance of this telegram be given to Press.

A.E. No need to inflame opinion here. It is inflamed.

If we don’t get reply, I’m inclined to tell U.S. we can’t wait &amp; are acting. P.M. Spoke to Winant: no answer coming in: we shall have to act. Tell Truman. W.O. to instruct Paget as agreed. Order Fr. back to barracks, use force if necessary. I.e. to restore order.
