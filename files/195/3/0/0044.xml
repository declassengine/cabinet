Reg. Advisory Councils are also a good new point.

of unpopularity awkward for candidates. c) this scheme must be in force when N.H.I. scheme is introduced. d) E.M.S &amp; mil. hosp. must be worked into scheme. Announce in speech at end of next week. R. Supported. Otherwise we shall be in false posn. M/H. Candidates want answers. O.S. Why delay a week. M/H. Not too soon after Parlt. rises. - Agreed: early or middle of next week. M/H. Popular with l.a.’s save L.C.C. Vol. hospitals are all behind this modified scheme. P.M. Moran’s views? M/H. Puts university region even higher – but we are giving Reg. Adv. Council, which goes a long way to meet him. P.M. Spoke (without much understanding) about health centres. H.O. Not enough emphasis in Memo. on facilities for expert treatment – in hospital or by specialists. P.M. New feature – centres for diffusion of knowledge. That kind of centre. Aim must be to raise the standard of G.P.’s – by keeping them in touch with centres of illumination on up-to-date medical Get something new into this. O.L. We are at cross-purposes.

policy.

a) Planning of the services to be shared between l.a.’s &amp; experts

But don’t let us be finally committed to a post-Election health M/H. But I’ve bn. negotiating on behalf of Govt. R.A.B. I refuse to decide this to-day. H.O. Certain phrases in original W. Paper v. unpopular with doctors. These changes will cure those diffies. Statement with more authy than R.A.B. suggests wd. be v. helpful. M/H. Not concessions to doctors only – want 4 or 5 pts. &amp; promise to introduce early legn in new Parlt. B.S. In reply to R.A.B. what, meanwhile, do we reply in Election – other Ministers and candidates. M/H. Genl. description of changes – at request of P.M. (hosp. &amp; doctors) b) 30 areas are limited: hence Reg. Adv. body based on teaching hospitals c) L.a.’s keep hospitals vice transferring them to Joint Bd. d) No “direction” of doctors e) No payment to vol. hospitals from l.a. f) No central emplt. of doctors by a C.M. Board. g) Improvements in teeth, eyes, deafness. B.B. Support M/H. – because this will placate the doctors. R. Certain differences in Scotland. P.M. Assheton should be consulted on terms of speech.

Agreed: on this basis: statement to be submitted to

Also publication (after speech) of statement – progress report – by Govt. P.M. &amp; Assheton. 2. Italian Prisoners of War. will play U.S. off v. us.

R.K.L. Decision by U.S. w’out consultn with us. We must confirm. Awkward for Italian Govt. if we don’t: &amp; they Decision, not of nos., but in principle – to tell Ital. Govt. we shall send them back as transport becomes available &amp; their labour can be replaced.

P.J. Most will have to stay here for another 12 months – for no transport will be available. Cautious statement must therefore be made. P.M. Not good foreign policy to seek short-term applause from any

country: but solid support of countries whose support is worth having. What advantage can Italy give us? R.K.L. They won’t go. And if we lag behind U.S. in this, it won’t do us much good with Italian Govt. M/Ag. Impossible at this moment to let one of them go. Co-operators – work singly on farms – good. Others work in gangs. V. unfair to let 2nd go first. Can’t replace 1st class by Germans. P.J. Cd. send a few at a time from M/East. H.M. Long history at A.F.H.Q. a) release those impd in Italy. This is now done. b) 30.000 p.o.w. attd to Fr. Army as troops. These cd. be released. Italian Govt. wd. do better to keep them abroad. Why not wait until asked – keep it going – harvest will be in. Agreed. { wait: &amp; handle thro’ diplomatic not { military channel. [ Exit Sandys.

3. Civil Service Salaries. J.A. No change since 1920. Not enough. Foreign Service rates are being promulgated. Propose changes in intermediate grades. Total cost about 340/360.000. These changes will enable a) improvemts. in scientific scale. b) refusal of bonus to A.S. and P.A.S. P.M. What is the urgency? J.A. No other opportunity for wks. Dpts. are held up. Temporaries will go.

Repns re scientists: lawyers.

Further delay will involve grave loss of efficiency. Also Foreign Service has got ahead. O.L. Supported – qua attracting temporaries. O.S. Col. II was considered opinion of M.G. Gttee. Are we debarred from

raising that later? J.A. No. Discussed with P.M.: thought Col. III was essential for the present: P.M. didn’t want to go further now on the highest

grades. Approved – as in Column II. – postpone announcement. [ Exit R.A.B.

4. General Election: Service Aircraft. E.E.B. Read A.G.’s opinion. H.M. Re last para. Ministers after Dissolution will be based in constituency. Permissible therefore to fly them to London and back: where necessary for business.

ex-Ministers of corresponding rank because of their duty

P.M. Go right at it – on grounds of speed. And offer same facility to to advise public opinion. Ministers must have every facility to save time. As courtesy, we extend same facilities to ex-Ministers. O.S. &amp; H.O. Supported H.M.’s distinction. H.O. Ex-Minister using aircraft for an electioneering tour. That is the red light.
