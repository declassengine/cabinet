387

[Enter Paling &amp; Griffiths.

A. Agreed – genl. discn on Mon. week: then Bill will go thro’ on the nod. H.M. 20/12 to 22/1. Christmas Adjournment. Announce to-night. 4. National Insurance Scheme. a) Rates. J.G. Party &amp; T.U.C. accepted Bev. principles. Follows they shd now be related to current c/living figure. Future: automatic adjustmt. wd. brk. down: prefer therefore review after 5 yrs. H.D. Formidable financial burden. Can’t advise Cabinet to accept this plan

as it stands. Cost: see p.1. of my memo. Increased Exch. cost

£10 m. p. decade. Contributors’ share remains constant. Rises even after 20 years. a) Can’t therefore justify higher rate of o.a.p. for single person: accept rate for couple. Original 20/= &amp; 35/=. I agreed 20/= &amp; 40/=. S.S. Cttee. have now gone further. People aren’t really expectg. 26/=. Wd. accept 21/= and 42/=. Diffce initially £27 m. + £3/4 m. permanently out of £10 m. increase. b) Unwilling to abandon Lab. Party policy tht. pensions shd. be retirement pension. Incentive to postpone retirement. Agree ½ a wk. not enough: wd. be ready to go up to 2/6 and 5/= a week extra for each year for wh. retirement is p’poned.

c) Unlimited duration of u. benefit. Can’t agree unless real

assurance tht. malingering can be prevented. Don’t suggest training as a check: cdn’t change of job or residence be substituted. General. Approachg. period of numerous claims. Must counsel caution. Can’t deal with this on basis of mere generosity. Realistic finance. R.L. Will c/living be held or even reduced. That wd. make a big difference. H.D. Diff. to foresee: but wd. do my best to hold it. A.G. Compromise report. H.D. Contributions. Scheme wd. cost 5/2. My amendmts. are worth 7d a week each. This wd. come down to 4/7. And preserve contributory principle. A.G. On c) above. J.G. believes existg. safeguards to check malingering. M/L. didn’t fully agree.

388

a) above. Doubtful wtr. 26/= cd. be accepted. b) above. Now favour, on reflection, inducement of 2/6 and 5/=. G.A.I. On c). Greatly concerned. After last war much improper claiming on Fund. Feel somethg. stronger than last time. Refusal of work not training. T.U. pressure: but all T.U. schemes have limited benefits. Under full emplt. we shd. be able to offer some job. Wd. like

therefore unlimited duration. Job in other area - &amp; allowances. On balance – against unlimited duration. E.Sh. On b) - support retirement pensions. People shd. not have pensions stop work. On c) - u. benefit must be hedged round with condns. Unwilling tht. u. benefit shd. be payable to anyone unwilling to accept work on proper T.U. condns. With remainder of H.D.’s case I disagree. Ours is expansionist policy – liberal resources in cash &amp; in kind. H.D. seems to assume encroachg. on Exch. involves burdens on nation: but not for transfer, wh. this is. To extent you promote full emplt. policy you reduce cost to Exch. – tho’ they go on paying contns. Must decide wtr. you have courage of this conviction. If you’re not sure of this policy you must pay higher rates, for if u. longer pay shd. be more. Same with effect of N.H. Service. On a) don’t ask single o.a.p. to live on 21/=. Coal at 4/2 p.cwt. T.W. a) – 21/= is 15/9. at ’39 values. b) wd. enable them to raise the amount. Support that. Also (c). But want 26/= for single o.a.p. E.W. c) might be real economy. Cd. hold 30 wks. if work available. Workers will support efforts to keep slackers off Fund. But breaks down in period of long unemployment. Then if duration limited, State must provide public works. “Unlimited benefit” bad phrase: put it on basis of “benefit or work”. E.B. Decide: pensions not except on retirement. Any other decision wd.

give rise to v. gt. trouble. J.G. This is ques. of best method of inducg. old people to stay on working. 8.000 o.a.p. already working. } P.M 400.000 vol. contributors – will have to be paid at 65 by contract} H.D. Those drawing – don’t stop. Others, however, only on retirement. J.G. Best way of keeping o.a.p. age groups at work. My concln was – divided pension wd. be best. If Cab. prefer the other inducements, I will accept – at 2/6 and 5/=. It is a balance on considns. 389

E.B. Is H.D.’s offer of 2/6 condl on 21/= vice 26/= for single rate. Believe 2/6 wd. be too high if 26/= adopted.

H.D. They are linked. Agreed: o.a.p. on retirement, and financial inducements to continue work after retirement age. The o.a.p. rate for single person. J.G. We cd. say 26/= is same as other single benefit rates. Don’t have to defend special rate for o.a.p. If put fwd. as separate rate, it will be forced up.

J. Supported 26/=. Diff to defend 21/=. Supplemn: diffy. is 1/3rd. are getting it. H.M. In N.H.I. and U.I. there is no supplementn. J. There is on U.I. H.M. It is not improper tht. people shd. get more in case of real need. Neither 21/= nor 26/= cd. be defended as enough where no resources. It may be too much in too many cases. General – this Rpt. seems to be based on doing better than Coalition, not on merits. This £10 m. p.a. will preclude help in future years to the active section of community – in education etc. 21/= can be raised to 26/= by staying on in work for 2 years.

E.B. Men will pay for pensions. Mistake to put increased cost of this on Exch. Average paymt. 7/= p. wk. for benefits to be covered by whole scheme. This is largely diversion. When we accepted Bev. figures, we reserved our posn re c/living. We never took the figures w’out saying actual rates wd. have to be fixed when Bill intd. O.a.p. Take 2/= p. wk. p. year. Wd. prefer 1/= for every 6 months. H.D. Agreed. But diff. between 21/= and 26/= is not increase of p. power. If you were going to take 20/= on Bev. figures, 26/- buys no more now. It means 6 more tokens to buy what they wd. have bought in 1938 for 20/=. But let a bigger propn of addl. 5/= be carried by contributors – less Ty. savings on supplementn. H.D. My troubles are in future – it mounts. Old people increase as contrib. remain constant. Wd. you agree tht. State shd. pay less &amp; same no./contrib. more? E.B. Wdn’t say it now. Let there be a review later. P.M. C/Exch. L.P.S. &amp; M/N.I. to reconsider in light of discussion. E.B. Willing to join in. Agreed.

390

Unlimited Duration. } Agreed. Genl. view against it. R.S.C. Married women after war.} J.G. “Continuous” not unlimited. Doesn’t last after refusal of job. Nothg. yet devised wh. caught the shirker. They penalise the

innocent. Believe enough safeguards already in Act. Stopping

benefit doesn’t solve it. They all come back to “genuinely seeking work”. That test won’t work. Lab. Party view – only real test = offer of job. E.B. I reported to Coaln Govt. on this. This Fund is not answer to unemplt. That is why I commended a limit. The cost after 30 wks. shd. not come on the contrib. I wasn’t concerned with dodges at all. State shd. carry this cost. He contributes only to

cost of mtg. normal unemployment.

Postpone. [Exit Griffiths &amp; Paling. [Enter. Tomlinson, B. Smith, Strauss. 5. Employment of Prisoners of War. G.A.I. Since memo. examd B. p.o.w. in U.S. But a) W.O. doubt wtr. they will work hard b) transport. If these were forthcoming it wd. ease our problem.

Str. Not necessarily – anyway we can afford shipping. Agreed.

B.S. Stated his requirements. 2.000 odd on beet-sugar. 900 brewing,

Str. Wd. be easier for us to bring these here than to bring from Germany to U.K. J.J.L. 175.000. If we ask for them, we’d have to supply shipping. G.A.I. Then – different allocations can be made. P.M. M/H. stresses danger of inflexible allocn: might cause unemplt. among them. G.T. Room for 43.000. After spring cd. put any overspill under canvas. seed crushg. animal feed etc., 2.100. Want at least another 900. G.A.I. If we can get U.S. supply, we can meet such cases. Present allocns will stand m’while. [Exit Tomlinson, Smith, Strauss. Enter M/Inf. 6. Government Publicity Services. H.M. Urgent ques: shd. MoI. continue?

391

Majority view: don’t continue a) Politically difficult b) Doubt if work for full-time Minister w’out encroachg. on other Ministers.

P.M. Report of Labour Group. I met them &amp; pointed out pol. diffies. My view: v. dangerous politically. In Opposn we shd. object. Machinery for puttg. our case overseas - &amp; use that at home. Political – I mean, not merely diffies in H/C. but long-term re functions of Govt. A. Depends on what you put in its place. Not fully satisfied with

altern. plan. Will reserve my points for that discussion. MoI. Grounds for my view were stated in memo. Preservn of peace rests on opinion of world peoples. Need to create peaceful world opinion. If MoI. goes, overseas Dpts will all resume separate control. P.M. Why? Cdn’t there be a central agency? MoI. The views I put to External Group cover my opinions. M’while Ministry is melting under my hands. Doubt if alternative wd. be as effective. H.M. doesn’t indicate what is to be done with B.B.C., B. Council etc. R.S.C. Genl. agreemt. there shd. be a central agency. Ques. is: political: shd. that agency be controlled by a Minister responsible for nothg. but “informn”. Agreed: no Minister. H.M. Accept principle of H.M.’s rpt.: and let official working party put in detailed rpt. A. Take a/c. of B. Council. T.W. Wd. C.I.B. be able to handle films? H.M. Yes. H.M. Arranged P.Q. Bringing MoI. to an end: considg. alternative arrangemts. etc. Settle also – what can be said to retain the staff. Agreed. H.M. to settle drafts of both &amp; report to P.M. 392
