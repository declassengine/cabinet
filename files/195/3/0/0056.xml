C.M. 24(45). 20th August, 1945. India: Constitutional Problem. P.L. a) men sentenced to death for communal activities – Respited &amp; commuted. b) detenus. c) men engaged in anti. B. activities. d) Early elections (apart fr. using them as elect. colleges): save in Punjab, where V. is unwilling to force hand of P.M. Main issue – constitutional issue. Now war is over, this Govt. wd. not wish to do less than Cripps offer – tho’ not commd to every detail. India Cttee decided to ask Viceroy to take first step – as in draft statement in C.P. 121. Also thght. Viceroy shd. come home to discuss. W. has sent 2 telegrams in comment. Want to be consulted before we announce a final decision. Think we must do so. India Cttee agreed he shd. come before decn put into effect: in view of his request I think he shd. come before any announcemt. made. Ind. Cttee thght. announcemt. shd. be made when El. announced. Now I suggest we shd. state merely tht. W. comg. home for consultn. W. wants announce electns to enable prepns to be made. Shd. be annd in India. On Indian Franchise Bill &amp; on continn of s.93. we shall have to say somethg. re electns this winter. If decided by 7 p.m. to-night W. cd. be authd to make announcemt. wh. wd. get on radio early Tuesday – if it’s announcemt. he agrees then. Concln: W. shd. be allowed to come &amp; discuss before we take any step in this matter. P.M. Cttee. never intended draft to be put out now. We wanted, when statemt. on electns, statemt. on constitl issue. Wanted a statement on our genl. line of policy. Doubtful wtr. P.M. Punjab shd. be allowed to prevent electn – Parlt. lasted 10 yrs. R.S.C. Most people in India will put up excuses for delay – can’t listen to them. P.L. All I meant was if we rush W. into makg. v. early statemt. no time to canvass with P.M. of Punjab. P.M. But W. can’t say “everywhere save in Punjab”. You say he wants early statement. Statement by Rag. 8. – Hopeless. [Agreed. 251

We said “as soon as war ended, elections &amp; then constituent assembly.” R.S.C. We said “cessn of hostilities” = even more urgent. P.M. Don’t understand argumt. tht. any statemt. will put elections on communal issue. But they always are. And we shd. then see where India’s opinion stands. No good fiddling about with membership of Ex. Council. Take a line – put it on India – must have electns. R.S.C. Go ahead with Electns. Wd. like to say this: 1st step. Otherwise – pressure &amp; we shall be yielding to their initiative. x/ We’ve always said this offer stands: it does stand: 1st step to elections. S. Consultn with W. advisable. R.S.C. I accept that – get him back at once. P.M. Maybe enough to announce electns &amp; invite W. home. But fear won’t be suff. obvious on that alone tht. we regard electns as 1st step. E.W. If Govt. for once did somethg. before pushed, it wd be gt. advantage. R.S.C. Avoid any impn tht. we are thinkg. of somethg. diff. from ’42. Want announcemt. as at x/. P.L. But this is the statement W. doesn’t want us to make w’out discn. Need for early statemt on electns? a) W. wants to get on: adminve prepns. b) I shd. say somethg. on Ind. Franchise Bill. R.S.C. They are bound to ask – are these electns the 1st step towds. 1942 offer – at least in H/C. A.B. In H/C. – s.93. business – better a narrow statement if you don’t want to give wide debate. E.B. Favour W. saying only “electns will be held” – then come home for consultn. Preferably round time of C.F.M. Time of change: impn tht. H.M.G. are putting own house in order at same time as they order others! A.B. Case for putting whole picture at once a) some will co-opte more in electns if they think they can thus get into elect. college. b) U.S. opinion. Will strike them as in accord with U.S. history.

Why not tell W. what we intend therefore &amp; if he has strong objn let him come home. E.B. Timing – Electns announced at once: W. sent for: he will take some time to talk: then announce purpose of Elections about a week before C.F.M. P.M. 18211 to W. - what was para. 1? P.L. Read it. - - - - - - - H.M. Why not - - - - - - - One &amp; indeed immediate purpose then will have to follow consultns re future constitl. R.S.C. Either one or other. No compromise. Content if he comes back at once. Agreed: as in P.L. proposal (oral) avoid extended debate. 2. Supplies &amp; Services (Transitional Powers) Bill. R.S.C. Do Cab. realise this will give no power to make new Regs., of any kind i.e. after Feb. next. We may want a lot of little powers – e.g. on cotton industry – for wh. legn wd. be v. heavy measure. H.M. Done this way on merits as well as politics (Coalition) x/ What R.S.C. is suggesting: “powers wh. were adequate for war are not enough for peace.” Look at R.55: cd. anything be more severe than that. And the Bill applies it to the new purposes. Parly tactics: if not necessary to amend it, don’t do it. A.G. Was thght shd. be presented this week. R.S.C. Tactically better to leave it as it is. But let us be clear no power to make new Rgs. to deal with new cites. A.B. Ministers concerned with housing anxious re control of labour – risk of diversion to activities, more profitable than housing. Want power to direct employers as we can’t direct employees. Doubt if this can be done under the existg. powers. H.M. Been examined over months. R.S.C. B/T. were satisfied all powers covered under Coaln Govt.: doubtful wtr. it will be enough for policies of Labour Govt. E.Sh. Stressed x/. Shdn’t agree until we know what the powers are. 253

P.M. Will long title permit us to make any change? C.E. If B/T. will send me particulars, I will examine before it comes to Leg. Cttee. J. Let us have concrete examples &amp; we will consider at Legn Cttee wtr. it can be done under Bill as it stands. Remitted to Legn Cttee.
