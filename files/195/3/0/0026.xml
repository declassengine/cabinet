W.M. 51(45). 25th April, 1945. 1. Standing down of Civil Defence Services. H.O. a) Partial – nos. or Regions. S.W. Midlands, Wales wd. be safe. But adminve tasks of redn wd. be great &amp; wd. involve retaing. Reg. staffs. b) Wholesale stand-down on C.O.S. advice. Wd. save money &amp; man-power. Future of C.D. wd. have to be considered – cd. wait M/L. N.F.S. ? H.O. Diff. because of peace-time services. Are reducg. this: no ques. of stand-down for them. M/L. Cd. you not reduce quickly to Stage II level for N.F.S. Short of drivers, &amp; able-bodied men for other work. H.O. Am reducg. steadily: can’t go down quickly to Stage III levels. A.S. R.O.C. Vital part of A.D.G.B. If permanent members go, it will become operationally ineffective. H.O. If case for standing down C.D., is there any for R.O.C.? A.S. Want R.O.C. included with stand-down plan for C.D. But probably diffy. in retaining nucleus for reconstituting R.O.C. in emergency. Must also find other means of carrying out its function in relation to aircraft safety.

Want therefore to work in with H.O. – includg. any announcement.

M/L. Para 3. Cd. C.O.S. give us a report in a week? All told 100.000 includg. able-bodied &amp; useful adminve staffs. Want them quickly. H.O. Can I go ahead, with A.S., as soon as C.O.S. give the word. P.M. No need for C.O.S., is there? Let them meet to-day. We want to give the 2 months’ notice at once, subject to their “Veto” - reported to me to-day. M/L. Shd. be reduction of V. points protection – factories etc. J.A. This is being taken up.

2. Legal Basis of Economic Control in Transition Period. Many things will have to be done, or undone, at short notice.

H.O. Considered by R. Cttee: W. agrees &amp; concurs in presentn to Cab. Field for exercise of def. powers after end/European war will be narrower &amp; Parlt. will want to review. Increasing use of Def. powers for peace – not war – purposes. Parlt. last June said shall want a statement before next time showg. what powers will be used after end/war. Europe. Must be told before August. Recommend frank statement of what we intend – new legn - coupled with increased Parly control i.e. over orders. Extent to wh. future Govt. uses these powers will be w’in control of Parlt. We shd. get the new powers through. A proper function of Coalition Govt.

26.6.44.

P.M. Legn is permissive. W. Yes: but all that it does make must be laid. And orders too. B. New basis of control. See p.2. 1(1)(b) implies use in peace. P.M.’s statement applied only to end Jap/war. Bill also contradicts A.S. statement in ‘41 (P.M. authy) tht. all emergency legn affectg. liberty of subject will disappear. We can go on with existing Bill. Parlt. was restive only over security Regs. L.O. opinion tht. E.P.D.A. covers overcomg. the dislocation. Propose postponemt. until after end/Jap. war. R. Cttee: 4 Ministers favoured new legn . Others (6) relied on existg. Acts. H.O. There was a later mtg. W. At R. Cttee we tried to recognise tht. shortages won’t end with end/war = control will have to continue: we wanted to restore Parly. control over adminn. M.A.P. L.O. not definite that existg. Regs. cd. be used for transitional purposes. After last war Cts wdn&apos;t enforce some of them. Need for fresh Parly. sanction. B. Quoted from E.L.(44) 14. “dislocation”. H.O. What about priorities for furniture, housing etc. How relate that to war? B. 9/10. R. Cttee. A.G.’s views.

M.A.P. Letter from A.G. 11/10. “wd. like to see it given a run on the basis that it is intra vires.” M/L. Convinced somethg. must be done – not sure about form. Met bldg. trade – dilution accepted at cost of specl. agreemt. for

house-bldg. for 2 years.

But under what power can I do it? What about a National Recovery Bill, to cover that period only. W. Doesn’t this Bill do it? M.A.P. Impossible to re-enact under new Bill. Need to carry on all the stuff which exists now. – or some of it, which is requd. Better to put that to Parlt. &amp; get fresh sanction than hope courts won’t challenge contd use of Defence Acts. P.M. Don’t see how it fits politically. Conservatives wdn’t like it. Labour wd. want more. But prs. answer to this is permissive character of the Bill. Demand for abrogation of controls – can be met by progressive relaxations. Cons. wd. want to do that. Can’t tell what other controls we may need after war. Situation less susceptible to forecast than was first 2 years of this war. Dreadful conditions likely in Europe. B.B. Another aspect – many people believe controls will hinder recovery. Shd. W.S.C. be identified with this? H.O. Cons. Govt. cd. say we are not commd to extent of using these powers. B. You cd. go on with Def. Acts. Rationing, for example. P.M. For housing I wd. advocate v. extreme Govt. measures. And why not clear a slum area at the same time. Pass the preamble. Next week consider the text.
