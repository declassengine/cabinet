No piloted activity. Disclosure of Scientific Information to Foreigners. L.P. P.M. wants decision deferred until he can attend. O.L. French restive because given hope they wd. get a lot. Policy to build up large Fr. Forces. But diff. to know how far we go at present. On Z. Mission much to be said for holding back informn: inadvisable not to go the whole way anyhow. A.S. Not much diff. betwn. O.L. and C.O.S. telegram. Want to encourage Fr. to work with us. Not as doubtful as O.L. suggests

that Fr.want to partake in Jap. War. Last part of memo. - lever for alliance - is v. diff. For this informn is shared between us &amp; U.S.A. The C.O.S. suggn is best - agreement with U.S. Chief of Staff on what can be disclosed. O.L. A.S. puts my point too high. I only said these wd. be valuable cards. A.S. But the cards aren’t wholly in our hands. O.L. I know: but I said on p.1 that we must first agree with U.S.A. They will prob. want to go further - for reasons of commercial interest plus sentiment. M.A.P. We shd do somethg. in order to secure connn with Fr. aviation - which otherwise U.S. will pinch. L.P. Views of C.O.S.? C.I.G.S. Nothing to add to telegram. C.A.S. We recognise tht. anything we give to France will have to be given to Russia if they ask for it. O.L. Earlier criterion - disclose nothing wh. can’t come into production there in this war = won’t now work. What is disclosed now will be of use for peace-time future of Fr. munitions industry: or preparing for next war. R.L. We wd. want to get Mission over: &amp; disclosure maximum. Card for alliance - wd. be outweighed by objn of alienating French now. C.A.S. We feel U.S. will want to go further than we. Therefore we want a tighter agreement with U.S. before we talk to French. Relief through the Blockade. R.L. SHAEF have no objn. Supplies wd. have continued to go in by rail if rlway had not been cut. CIGS. No operational objn. Agreed. Third Session of the Council of U.N.R.R.A. R.L. Must be 2 mtgs p.a. May or June. Always hoped next wd. be in Europe,

prob Paris. French can’t do it. Shd. we do it in London. Only about 100 coming in to U.K. for this. No accommn diffy. Para 7(a). June not May. J.A. There may be diffies - some anyway. May have to ask for Church House. R.L. County Hall? J.A. Will F.O. provide clerical &amp; typing staff? You will prob. have to import fr. Provinces. Agreed.
