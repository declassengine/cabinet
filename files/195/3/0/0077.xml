C.M. 59(45). 5th December, 1945. Washington Discussions on Financial Questions. P.M. Point reached for Cab. decision. H.D. U.K. draft at last Cab. U.S. counter-draft: in many respects the same but some diffies. Many mtgs. in W’ton: &amp; here of 3 Ministers. Substantial point now outstandg: transit. period is connn with B.W.A. and scheme generally. U.S. counter proposal unsatisf. Strong telegram sent askg. for 3 amendmts – a) t. period origin. 5 yrs under B.W.A.: U.S. were seekg. to reduce to little more than one b) U.S. seekg. deprive us only of benefit of scarce currency clause c) not clear how far we retained right to resign fr. Fund. As a result: b) we have won outright. c) our freedom to resign not challenged - &amp; to re-value sterling: but not to re-impose exchange control on current transaction by resigning. First = the more important. a) we haven’t bn. met: &amp; U.S. ready to break on this. This therefore is the issue. T. period originally cont. = 5 yrs. Now agreed: 15 mos. fr. effective date (for both Agreemt. &amp; Fund). Ques. = betwn. 15 mos. &amp; 5 yrs. We suggd Dec. ’48 &amp; they reject it. Shd. we make final effort for e.g. 21/2 yrs? But: pt. was to give us freedom when we were short of f. exchange. They say, you won’t now be short because of loan. Awkward for Parlt. presentn tht. this period is to be cut down. But shd. we break on this?

P.M. To what extent have we already cut into our rights under t.p. agreemt. H.D. In U.K. draft considered before: commd to free dollar earngs. w’in 1st 15 mos. Sterling area desire this. For Sterling area therefore this pt. already given away. Countries for wh. restns wd. remain = some not founder members of Fund, mainly Switz., Spain &amp; P., Argentine. Qua other founder members, already commd to freeing on current earnings in 15 mos. Not therefore as much in this quantitatively. Alternatives. Fr. loan: terms much more harsh. Repaymt. in 30 yrs. vice 55 &amp; beginning at once. 23/8 vice 2%. If we get this, need for care over dollar exp. wd. remain. Slow drawg. – qua overdraft. And build up exports w’in 2-3 yrs.

Durg. tht. time protected by this credit fr. impact of econ. condns outside. Cd. build up standards/livg. 6 year fr. Dec. 45 before paymt. begins. Shd. get right by then – increasg. release fr. shortages &amp; austerity. Assumg. reasonable freedom for expts. shd. be able to carry the charge by then.

If we don’t get this – a) reversal on standards = food, clothing, tobacco. Recalled earlier informn on this. Less of all foods save bread &amp; potatoes. This = immediate consequences before switching to other sources. b) Power to export limited by gt. U.S. drive on competitive basis. c) Political consequences on this Govt.: wd. be said to be our fault. d) Canadians wd. say we had broken on an unimportant point. W’in sterling area disintegration wd. begin rapidly. They don’t like our control of dollar pool. S. Afr. wd. quickly brk. away: U.S. wd. offer India gt. inducemts. to brk. away. Egypt wd. go. We shd. be left with Austr. &amp; N.Z. e) Genl. effect on Anglo. U.S. co-opn - &amp; internatl. political posn. Conclude: not justifiable to break on this. Make a final attempt to get

shdn’t be so dependent. Even by ’47 chance we wd. be well on

some alleviation – e.g. extend to Dec. ’47. R.S.C. Diffy. more psychol. than real. In fact not giving much because t. period much cut down already. Won’t therefore make much diff. in dealg. with sterling. Real diffy. is Parly. one – askg. for ratificn of B.W.A. at same time as bilateral agreemt. Cuttg. down period fr. 5 yrs. to 15 months. Quite logical, however, for U.S. to say large loan with no repaymt. for 5 years makes it unnecessary for you to invoke Art. 14 of B.W.A. Alternative so disastrous I believe we shd. face Parly. diffy. E.B. I am against brkg. on this. Concerned to get our industry going – for reconstn of Europe. Tried for ’48 because believed by then we the road. Try for ’47. P.L. If U.S. had opposed c) it wd. have bn. v. serious. Glad Art. 15 isn’t challenged. a) is much less serious. Not of practical importance. And much in U.S. argument. Think we shd. accept – must prime the pump. Doubt if its worth trying to get ’47. Wdn’t help the Parly. argument. Might introd. fresh complicn. I wd. accept w’out a last attempt to haggle. H.M. Agree with C/E. &amp; B/T. A. . . . . . . . . Shd. get no support fr. Canada or S. Afr. if

we broke on this.

A.V.A. On prev. pts. of doubt negotiators have done v. well.

We may be optimistic re recovery. Heavy fiscal charge in ‘50/51. Wd. like a further effort to extend – to ’47. because Parly. diffy.

Worth another shot.

A.G. Consequences of a brk. – for other countries as well as us – so severe

I wdn’t brk.

Agree with P.L. re last shot. Agreemt.

E.Sh. Don’t attach importce to redn of t. period because agreemt. as a whole so bad. Only pt. on this = it’s bilateral, in a multi-lateral Presented with alternatives. My answer to that: haven’t adequ. explored posn in long run if this accommn rejected. H.D.’s figures etc., have related to immediate consequences only.

understandg. we buy heavily fr. U.S. Don’t believe our

Believe tht. if we had stood up to U.S. we’d have done better. This = overdraft only &amp; on one bank. Asked to accept on industry. recovery depends on imports fr. U.S. Do believe their industr. recovery depends on makg. loans on condn of

obligns.

Too much concerned with our diffies = not enough with theirs.

better to say at outset we wdn’t accept Agreemt. wh. wd. militate

E.B. Comm. Policy. Don’t let us forget that Art. 7 was

purchase of their exports. U.S. Shylock. We cd. have impeached them before the world. That wdn’t have embittered Anglo-U.S. relns. What would do so is if 2/3 years hence we have to say we can’t meet our A.B. U.S. insisting on this redn in t. period in order to force us into takg. up credit. This is U.S. come-back on our puttg. it on basis of overdraft. Forces us to use the dollars instead of Art. 15 method of escaping tempy diffy. This is how argument will be put in Parlt. Psychol. aspect. R.S.C. thinks he has got all he wants – but U.S. think the same. Risk of mutual self-deception. Will foul Anglo-U.S. relations. They &amp; we will think of spirit, not letter. Can’t brk. on this sort of point, if we once accept Agreement in substance. Negotiators v. skilful – but our approach was wrong. Wd. have bn. v. reconstn of world-trade. E.W. } In general agreemt. with E.Sh. } J. } So am I but can’t break on this point. signed – to get

Lease-Lend. A.B. Time-table. Will our Debate come first? H.D. Yes: Congress adjourned until Jan. 384

A.B. That means our debate presents it to U.S. All our arguments will be used in Congress.

H.D. Finance Group – asked earlier for views on B.W.A. Majority

wd. help us.

R.S.C. We have got an agreed expln – ie. they agree to our interpn. H.M. Presentn shd. be objective: not writing it up or down. thought it advent. to us. Last-minute attempt. H.D. x/ Tell them we will accept: but remind them tht. fr. Parly. angle ‘47 Agreed: subject to x/. 2. Parliament.

H.M. Risk tht. H/C. might object to absence. I wdn’t risk it.

A.B. Business in H/C. Friday. Had Confce in Nottingham. Rpt. &amp; 3rd Rdg. of Bldg. Bill. A.B. Only Opposn likely to object. H.M. Bill of some importance. You shd. be there. A.B. Tomlinson is there. 385
