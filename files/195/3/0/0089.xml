P.M. Parly. Secy. to open : Cab. Minister (presumably H.M.).

P.M. Statement on Tuesday re. atomic energy full-scale prodn. Read it out.

Need to buy some U.S. aircraft to avoid U.S. scooping all air traffic. H.D. Agreed to dollars for that – for stop-gap – either 4 Constellations or 4 Boeings. But diffens. of view between Bennett and M/C. A. B. says Lancastrian can fly Atlantic. For considn. wthr. Lanc. shd. be put on Atlantic by S.A. Corpn. P.M. These ques. cd. be considered by Cab. on Tuesday. R.S.C. BOAC have refused to order B. planes – stalling because want to buy U.S. planes – due to Critchley. Now trying to pinch R.A.F. planes. Sure this was concerted policy. Shd. be full enquiry into this. P.M. Agreed. H.M. Need for settled policy before Debate. P.M. Let H.M. go into this. Agreed. A. B/E. Bill – Tuesday. No petition yet.

P.M. Cab. can meet next wk. on Tuesday. Thereafter revert to Mondays. C.E. Thursday will be awkward because of Standg. Cttees.

2. N. Insurance Bill : Limitation of Unemployment Benefit. A.G. Explained views of S. Services Cttee.

J.G. Consultns. with Assistce. Bd. clear only 3 provns. wh. cd. be effectively relaxed – a) Savings. Disregard 1st £25 and rank every next £25 as = 6d. p.wk. In addn. war savings up to £375 disregarded. This must now be related to war savings : and legn. of genl. scope wd. be requd. b) Mixed household incldg. applicant for assistce. and another earning. 7/= of earnings regarded as available for relief of applicant. Any redn. in this amount wdn’t meet the grievance. c) Scales themselves. Wd. be reviewed in context of the Act wh. diff. betwn. householders and non-householders. Diffce. for non-householders is v. large : single man over 21 wd. lose 11/= p.wk. on transfer fr. benefit to assistance. Unless v. steep increase in scale there wd. be substantial drop. No longer theoretical because unempt. increasg. in areas where memories are bitter. Will be dispute therefore in Parlt. on basis of attack on means test for unemployed. Revival of old controversy in bitter form – v. dangerous. Hence scheme for special credit for 2 years. Wd. cover most cases. Finance out of reserve in Fund, w’out comg. on to contributions. £100 m. of these reserves are to be paid into current a/c of new scheme. H.D. Disturbed by this. Re-opens Cab. decn. in wh. we attached great importnce. to preservg. solvency of Fund. Defeatist proposal. We fought election on full emplt. policy – great labour shortage – yet we have so little faith in that we propose scheme in wh. people can live for 2½ years on the Fund. That surely is a shocking proposal to put fwd. on basis such cases will be numerous. Developmt. Area policy – is surely a failure if this risk is real. And if it is, remedy shd. be overhaul of dev. area policy. Thought we decided there shd. be overhaul of Assistance scheme. Stand by that. Still ought to be done. Cd. this be brought to an end after 2 yrs. Same argumts. cd. be used for permanent provn. on same lines. 457

Fund. Wd. be wrong to begin to draw on reserves. Emplt. Policy. This is not the emergency period : it’s about 2 yrs. hence tht. deflation may begin. That is the time for wh. we need our reserves. That will be a national emergency. This proposal is addressed only to develop. areas, a local problem only. But if it is passed, as genl. issue, problems in adminn. everywhere. J.G. Largely men. V. few women can qualify for assistance.

V. E. Day redn. in munitions strengths and no other emplt. found.

Expediency. The Bill as a whole will be welcomed warmly. On Cttee. if v. strong feelings expd. We could look at it again. Sorry to do this at any stage : but don’t do it now. Thus on merits, don’t do it at all. On tactics, don’t do anything now. P.M. Where are these long-term unemployed? G.A.I. Only heard of women in Wrexham who are exhaustg. benefit. Not mobile : many not really askg. genuinely for work. R.S.C. Pockets in developmt. areas. 4 M. Tydfil. Up to date we’ve potentially provided emplt. for 50% of pre-war unemployed. Hope 100% by end/46. But lay of 12/18 months before factories begin to operate – 1947 or 48 before all unemployed absorbed. Assume ¼ m. unempld. by end/46 in dev. areas – of ½ m. total. And 15% over 6 and 15% over 12 months unemployed in devel. areas. Much smaller percentage outside devel. areas. Thus end/46, 37.500 over 12 mos. unempld. in devel. areas. Outside devel. areas nos wd. be comp. small. P.M. But problem then = you have covered those not intendg. to go on workg. R.S.C. Yes : married women as after last war. J.G. Pre-war up to 1940. Regns. applying special condns. to m. women. These were suspended in 1940. My Bill gives power to make such Regs. I shd. consult with M/L. in time to introduce. Wd. also cover seasonal workers.

458

A.B. It was accumulation of unemployed (for over 6 mos.) in devel, areas tht. had S.S. Cttee to support this proposal.

Argument at Cab. – not a charge on contribns. in Fund. Agree some force in that. But C/E can take charge of that – direct Ty. response to above on certain figure. Second argument – don’t pay people who don’t intend to work. Agree with that. But it isn’t the fact we face in devel. areas. There is no work there yet. How justify movg. those people to lower rate.

The lead swinger is on Assistance because in most parts of country there is work to offer him and he loses benefit if he refuses. Women: This is being cured or mitigated. The good contn. record is not now in operation and they are being pushed out of insurance. In other areas they can be offered work. Parly. tactics. You cdn’t. hold this posn. re. criticism. Most bitter memories. Can’t stand up to criticism on bad case. E.B. Agree regarding drop in benefit – don’t want to defend that. Tho’ why base it on single man, for surely he can be treated as mobile. Suggest, as compromise, test of availability for emplt. on end/benefit of 30 weeks. Not prepd. to abandon insurance principle of this scheme. I reserved £100 m. durg. Coalition Govt – for special diffies. of demobn. period passing over balance for new Fund. If man can satisfy Bd./Referees tht. he is available and can’t be found work, empower them to authorise exchange to pay (from the special Fund) for specified no. of weeks. All this to be outside ordinary Fund. And no means test. But man shd. have to do somethg. after the 30 wks : it shd. not be automatic. H.M. Who wd. remain with Assistance then? E.B. V. few unemployed. Only sub-normal. Wd. enable exchange and to make single man to move. 459

I.G. This wd. meet the major problem.

E.B. Tempy. or permanent? I wd. limit it to 5 years. But wd have duration of extended benefit unlimited at discretion of Ct/Referees. H.D. Accept E.B.’s suggn. in principle – subject to scrutiny of details. Want opportunity also to look into the £100 m. point. H.M. I wdn’t have accepted the 2 year proposal wh. wd. have bn. unreal This may be a way out. We cd. experiment with this for a period. Time fact or on presentn. of Bill. We can’t keep our promise to have this Bill out before House resumed. There’s sure to be a row if not out next wk. Cdn’t we take power to deal with this by Regn? You may need legn. to use the £100 m. E.B. Doubt it. Agreed : H.D. to settle with J.G. (and E.B. if possible) today. Variation of Contributions. P.M. Was intended tht. this shd. be automatic. Now proposed it shd. be discretionary. That wd. be dangerous : because wd. be said Govt. cd. use it just before election. H.D. We objected to automatic movement. a) No date to measure normal postwar unemplt. b) Politically objectionable, even if cd. be done because it wd. appear tht. we expected certain level of unemployment. c) Wd. lead to complacency at any unemplt. lower than average. Concluded therefore in favour of general powers. Nicholson’s point on Ministers – thus then wd. be an automatic relation to a fixed point. H.M. We cd. promise H/C. tht. in Rgs. we would do our best to introduce automatic factor.

R.S.C. Protection in Affirm. Resoln J. Failed to find at this stage an objective test. 3. Spain. E.B. Apptn. for Don Juan, Giral and Gil Robles to come to (or thro’) U.K. 460

Diff. to grant one and refuse other. Agreed that all may come subject to good behaviour. E.W. G. Robles is a v. bad man. C.E. First I’ve heard of this : and responsibility is mine not F.O.S. Ready to consult E.B. F.O to consult H.O. P.M. Against G. Robles comg. here. 461
