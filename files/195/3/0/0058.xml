My predec. asked M.S. to come over – and he came a month ago . A.G. Clear tht. M.S. is moving twds. Dom. status &amp; wd like to preserve 2/3rds majority. But those points will come out in discn. We thought G.H. shd. discuss w’out committing himself on these points. All we want now is guidance for G.H. in these discns. 263

P.M. Is it wise to talk to him, before Rpt. publd &amp; considered by H.M.G. A.B. Undesirable to be rushed – this is a new Govt. Quick decns on pol. dynamite merely because M.S. happens to be in Ldn. R.S.C. Opinion in Ceylon – don’t want to make it set too hard. Cdn’t G.H. see M.S. – making it clear Rpt. not considered &amp; ask wtr, if it were adopted, he wd. insist on 2/3rds. P.M. Shd. Rpt. have bn. given to M.S. G.H. He is only man who cd. get Rpt. thro’, if we accepted it. He was invited here to discuss his attitude &amp; Ministers attitude twds the Rpt. P.M. When publish? G.H. After comments of M.S. &amp; Govt/India. E.Sh. He is here. Must see him. R.S.C. Invited here by a B. Govt. Must see him. No need to be commd – but cd. ask his re-actions. P.M. Grudgingly assented – now he has the Rpt. G.H. Want to get re-actions of M.S. &amp; Govt/India to Rpt. P.M. Postpone discn until next week – Rpt. being circulated meanwhile. Ready to meet on Monday, if necessary. A.V.A. Wd. help if Cab. also had Minutes of C. Cttee. 4. Demobilisation. G.I. Services discussg. statemt. But disturbed at Press campaign. Wd. P.M. see Editors. Believe all comes from Garry Allighan – Labour M.P. Want explann of scheme: and need to avoid smashing it. E.B. Send for Editor of D. Mail. A.B. Trouble not caused by the article but by facts – thousands of men bored with delay in demobn. This scheme has broken. We shd. revise it. 10.000 slders. in R.A.F. offered B. release. 1.000 accepted 305 are out. Same applies to all Dpts. B. keeps in not lets out a) volunteers b) condns c) direction. Soldier will be worse off then civilian. Disn retained for B releases relaxed for others. V. dangerous to touch the Press.

G.I. Certain chaos if you break the scheme. Must adhere to it. A.B. Want modifn in face of facts. Resistance of Service Depts. E.B. Avoid generalities. Critical sitn with Forces: nos. needed: Service Dpts diffies M. Power Cttee mtg on Monday. One suggn: Serv. Dpts. announcg. own releases. Let M/L. have sole control of press releases of informn on scheme. Co-ordination needed. (Generally agreed.) Then vice bald announcemt, have Press conference to explain why there are diffces in categories of release etc. A.V.A. Agreed. Have already taken it up in Admy. E.B. One spokesman for releases as for call-up. P.M. More explanation wanted also – people don’t understand. H.M. Concerned about uneasiness in H/C. &amp; public. Feeling tht. release cd. have bn. accelerated. a) Is there room for speeding up of rate b) are Dpts. working fast enough c) Need to explain. The P.R. side hasn’t been done well enough. Shd. be more Press conferences. Greater pains shd. be taken to inform Press – inform M.P.’s also. In general, we must govern by explanation. J.J.L. In best circs. there will be diffies over demobn. Public don’t know what happened last time. If this scheme fails, Heaven help this Govt. Co-ordn betw. Service Dpts &amp; M/L. is essential &amp; takg. steps to secure it. Even so, mischievous statements by Labour M.P. isn’t right. E.Sh. There is dissatisfn in Services. What are we going to do? Agree we must co-ordinate: but can we improve the Scheme? Remove anomalies. Then a Press confce to clear the matter up - &amp; get it across to Forces. E.B. Want to keep out of Press Confces – for M/Labour must stand out as publicly responsible – as I did before. P.M. Speed up. Cd. you get it out before weekend? E.B. Haven’t got it yet. G.I. Interview y’day – v. helpful. They say don’t interfere with scheme. They realise now some diffies arise fr. our being too honest.

T.W. That shows informn &amp; explanation is necessary. Ch.E. Trouble last time – because they mucked about with the scheme. Main grievance = the rate. Natural feeling of frustration now war is over. Remember extent to wh. our troubles last time were due to disappearance of B. Armies. x/ Suggest, after Press confce with M/L., b’cast by P.M. emphasising considns wh. we have to bear in mind – includg. duties of occupn. A.B. Two Mtgs of Housing Cttee decided we were being impeded by rate of demobn &amp; B. releases not producg. the nos. needed. Asked last week for mtg. of Man Power Cttee. Recognise E.B. has much to do. But we have a v. urgent problem. Will have idle bldg. workers on my hands because Grp B. not operatg. Let M.P. Cttee be empowered to consider modifns. In addn to x/ - hope M/L. will brk. down his figures in public announcemts. E.B. Home forces &amp; abroad. Remember the need for fairness. General explanation of demobn scheme. E.W. L.a.’s need of specialists – delay in vetting. E.B. I will see.
