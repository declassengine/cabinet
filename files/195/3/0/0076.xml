C.M. 58(45). 3rd December, 1945. 1. Financial Talks. Bretton Woods. H.D. 2 day. Debate. Critics of B. Woods cd. table amendmt. to Resolution. P.M. Bill wd. be un-amendable. H.D. Yes. All Debate on Resolution. H.D. Interpve decln: wd. be instn to our Delegate – to raise after we have become members. H.M. Spker asked if we can have wide debate, incldg. Bill questions. Can’t have debate on Bill because too wide. Thus, propose to take Debate on Resolution covering all three ques. Then if Bill before House anticipn rule might be awkward. Spker has agreed to waive rule, because Bill must be intd because of time factor. Can’t be an adjournment because legn regud. Bill &amp; money resoln to be attempted in the 2 days. If needed, another ½ day. Tues./Wed. of next week &amp; ½ Thursday. W.W. Agreed. A. Cl. 3(2) doesn’t exclude S. Rhodesia &amp; Newf. because not in St. of Westminster. Is C/E. clear on S. Rhodesia. We haven’t informed them. Agreed: A and H.D. to confer. Prob. S. Rhodesia must be excluded. P.M. General Time-table. H.D. Too early. Telegrams passing. R.S.C. Comm. policy – want my explanation given if I.T.O. first. Now looks as tho’ U.S. will telescope. Then I cdn’t give my statement followg. P.M.’s announcement.

P.M. I could incorporate substance in my announcement. Doesn’t draft go rather far, in para. 5 – of indicatg. agreemt. with I.T.O. document. A.B. Danger of misunderstanding.

E.Sh. Lever for demand for debate in H/C. Will W. Paper include the whole of proposals.

376

A. Doms. accept posn if this statement put out simultaneously. They agree to our putting it out. It must come out as same time. Agreed.

H.D. Progress of talks. EEB. went out Friday. Both B. &amp; U.S. texts now under discn. Telegrams coming on. Must be prepd to send reply this p.m. H.M. Let P.M., H.D. and R.S.C. settle, unless ques. of major diffy. arises. Agreed.A.B. Agreed.

H.D. Leakages. Statement on tape – “Loan Talks”, reprtg. pt. of view of Shinwell, Bevin on Loans, and purpose of Sir E. Bridges’ Mission. Can only have emanated from Cabinet – Ministers or officials. E.Sh. Discussed with nobody but Sir D.F. A.B. Inaccurate: didn’t know EEB. had gone until I saw it in Press. Doesn’t follow there has bn. leakage. My views &amp; Shinwell’s on U.S. loans are well known e.g. to Lobby correspondents – from speeches in H/Commons. Appears on tape on Mon. a.m. Cab. discn last Thursd. Both I and Sh. away fr. Ldn.

P.M. Need for special care re Cab. discns esp. when diffces of opinion. A.B. Want U.S. Press searched. H.D. Reason for not askg. that dissent be specially recorded. (Exit W.W.)

2. Sale and Purchase of Medical Practices.

Superannuation – not worked out.

A.G. Expld discns on Social Services Cttee &amp; with C/Exch. H.D. £40 m. spread over long period. Compensn only. Agree in principle – reservg. detail. A.B. Agree with Ty. to separate compn fr. superannuation. H.D. Advantage: young doctors won’t have to borrow. H.M. Don’t object if Ty. agree. Hope, however, no precedent – jumping things thro’ w’out seeing whole plan. A.B. Wd. have preferred to postpone. But drs. comg. out of Forces must know their future.

377

Agreed in principle. A.B. Procedure. Mtg. BMA. Cttee to-morrow a.m. &amp; will tell them in confidence. Wd. like to make statement in H/C. on Thursday. R.S.C. Awkward day. Do it in reply to P.Q. A.B. Can’t be sure wd. be reached. And Spkr. has said prefers statements. But will have P.Q. put down.

{Enter Smith &amp; Barnes. N. Baker.

3. Food Supplies for Germany.

H.M. Urgent – because shipping. M/F.: undue risk to U.K. stocks to meet more of G. demand. High-level approach (thro’ Foreign Secy.) to U.S. We are being asked to do more than we shd. – displaced persons etc., and fewer resources. U.S. can afford more easily to help. Extraction rate. Human objns arguable. Main objn = reduction in feed for livestock.

On that ground we concluded no change.

B.S. 6 m. tons shortfall on wheat year to June ’46. 20 m. against 26 m.

If not this, then somethg. fr. our stocks. 500.000 t. = minimum

requiremts. 21 m. exportable surplus from America. 8.8 m. against 14 m. 5.6 deficit. Can be met only by CFB revision of consumption of certain countries. CFB. are reviewg. posn now. M/W.T. 200.000 t. of wheat shipping (dollar tonnage) at Pacific ports. Can’t use B. ships because need to lift all tht. Canada can make available. Suggest tht., if Ty. agree to dollar tonnage, for every ship cleared fr. Pacific I will divert to Germany a ship from Canada to U.K. This doesn’t increase our offer – only gets it carried. Barnes. Point is: cdn’t carry it w’out cuttg. into M/F. imports. This Pacific off lift is new developmt. for avoiding that. N.B. For Hynd. Indispensable to get 1.6 m. tons recommd by Mission. The wheat must come fr. somewhere. More fr. exportg. countries: more economics in importg. countries. Includes raisg. extn rate to 85%. Must put this to Cab. We are one of 3 – Belgium &amp; Denmark (other two) are ready to go to 85% if we did. We shd. get 226.000 t. out of it. T.W. 800.000 pigs or ….. milk wd. be lost by this redn. N.B. E.E.C. believe we cd. get more fr. other economies in Europe if we adopted this. Pour encourager les autres.

378

workg. stocks. 848.000 = present L.P. estimate for June ’46. 1.8 is present level. Para. 8 of memo. This is most urgent sitn we are likely to have to face. This therefore is the time for emerg. action. B.S. 1.139.000 now – 848.000 in June ’46. By diversion of imports we might come to 300.000. 650.000 is minimum I can accept. P.M. Balance of 200.000 odd. T.W. Cd. speed up call of wheat off farms – but wd. imbalance.

I believe it is worth takg. greater risks for G. situation than M/F. want

Animal feed: need now is for greater variety of foods. Don’t cut

E.B. Don’t see why shd. reduce extn rate merely to stop Fr. feedg. full wheat to cattle. Right rate for humans is about 80%. With our modern plants we do better at 80% than others at 85%. More waste of bread &amp; flour at 85%. Anyway its bran - &amp; goes thro’ you. Opposed to altering it again. to take – i.e. we ought to let our stocks go lower rather than increase the extraction. back on that by wrecking livestock prospects. Recommend therefore M/F. shd. take bigger risk on stocks. A.V.A. Doubtful re gamble. We’ve rarely dropped as low as this. Failure of home crop wd. be disastrous – locally. E.B. Never ran pre-war over 600.000 t. T.W. Extraction. Told industry emphasis on livestock: promised food: they’ve bred in anticipn stock wd. have to be killed &amp; confidence wd. be undermined. Can’t have a livestock policy with varying food rations. General view of Cabinet: against increasing extraction rate. Stock levels. 845.000 or 650.000 next issue. A.B. Risk of epidemics fr. Europe. My advisers say serious situation. They urge more provn to raise calory standard in Germany. That risk shd. be set off against U.K. risk. B.S. May have to find wheat for India because of lack of rice. Reason for not reducg. stocks. Alternatively, save wheat to put more rice into H. Kong &amp; Malaya. Choice therefore do we help our own people first or Germany. 3 m. tons/wheat in Argentine wh. can’t be moved to seabord. My figures assume I get it. E.B. 700.000 wd. be safe.

379

Support E.B. – stocks down to 700.000.

H.M. Pre-war comparison not wise – because condns still unsettled. Trouble coming in S.E.A.L. Also U.K. needs must come before German. Pressure of publ. opinion h’to all one way. E.Sh. Implicns of our policy. More coal fr. Ruhr. Must therefore feed the miners. No sentiment about this. Business. Can you take a risk in order to step up prodn in central Europe. W’ton policy if accepted will ease posn. Can use dollar tonnage etc. P.L. . . . . Assuming no large diversion of supplies from India. H.D. No approach to U.S. pendg. concln of W’ton talks. Conclns as in memo. [Enter Wilmot, Tomlinson Exit N. Baker. 4. Labour Controls and Releases from Forces. E.B. As in memo.

Women: diff. situation arising: women keeping away fr.

G.A.I. M/L. control over labour is being lost. Must have an enforceable line.

No intn to call up apprentices or so-called apprentices.

Exception in respect of direction within the bldg. industry. Keep age, for labour control in step with call-up age. Must then enforce up to 30 – by procdgs when necessary. Exchanges because fear of direction: will do better therefore w’out control than with it. We were only country to apply this compulsion to women. Agriculture: no E.W.O. Ques.: shd. ring-fence be put round it. Let M/Ag. &amp; M/L. discuss. I haven’t studied that. Bldg. Both sides of advisory panel against any direction: tho’ claim there is black market. Agric. Ready to put in ring fence. Dpt. must recognise however that. this is barrier to recruitment e.g. fr. Forces. Women. Relaxn shdn’t extend to nursing. Retain up to 30. C. Service. Maintain save for persons over 60. Releases. Cl. B. now running at 10%. Deferment. Ready to defer some call-up fr. bldg. industries. Bldg. materials – defermt. also possible up to March &amp; then spread to June. In general, 2 months’ delay – will facilitate discns to meet needs of Dpts. Takg. into a/c rapid rate of releases – large nos. available – we believe control up to 30 (for bldg. up to 50) will enable us to meet needs of Civil industry.

380

Arrangemts. promised for defermt. for bldg. cd. perhaps be applied to mining – ready to discuss.

P.M. Publicity. In view of censure debate – re-consider recommn in C.P. 311. E.B. Tribute to Services &amp; M/W.T. on speeding-up of demobn. Proposals in C.P. 311 – designed to get more people out in spring. Saves much cost &amp; gives a lift to industry at the right moment. A.B. My points met by G.A.I.’s statement. Need for rigid enforcement of control. Black-market house-repairs, above licence value. T.W. Agree with Item 5 memo. Provided we get the labour from Class b. S. Overall-figure will be met. But R.A.F. can’t maintain same rate in 1946. Make it clear its over-all: not each Service separately. E.Sh. Special needs of mining on call-up. G.A.I. Deferred until Feb. Opportunity to review this again. Put them at tail-end of call-up. J.J.L. Old men dependent on call-up of young. B.S. Hope M/L. will recognise needs of food industries. Must have labour to replace p.o.w. A.V.A. Can’t maintain this rate of release without a) contd call-up. b) revision of commitments. Agreed { announce control decn – M/L. w’out delay. { reserve other announcemts. for P.M. in Censure Debate. E.Sh. Care in announcing relaxn of controls. Diffies for particular industries must be regarded. Must at same time impress miners with feeling tht. they are specially important. P.M. Statement to be framed in consultn with Dpts. concerned. Draft might be submd to Cab. on Thursday. T.W. Shdn’t be made before wages issue in agriculture settled. E.B. Defer announcemt. for a time. Confer with J.C.L Let P.M. say in Censure debate this increase in releases will make it poss. to consider relaxn of controls – this being considered ……… Then bring it out in 2 wks. 381
