P.M. After Def. Cttee review.

J.J.L. Up to schedule on demobn. Down to ¼ m. by May ’46.

advantage go.

T.W. New M.P.’s to have facilities to visit Continent – to see need for troops there. Up to Group 11. E.B. Not keen on M.P.’s going. But wd. like Ministers to go. E.g. M/H. to see what our people have to do e.g. on typhus. If Monty &amp; Lyne had 20 good men e.g. Boro’ Engineers &amp; M.O.H. they wd. do it much better &amp; quicker. Ditto. with food distn. These young officers need expert help – can use G. labour but want expert supervision. Also, help from M/Ed. experts to organise at top. Thus, suggest Ministers of Health &amp; Edn and Labour might with gt. P.M. Want O.R. Cttee or its Sub-Cttee to look at this. S. Support – from 7 mos. experience in Italy. Doubt if you can do much on educn. C.E. Educl administrators vice teachers. P.M. C.O.S. will attend at intervals – not weekly as hitherto. Foreign Affairs – weekly review.

2. Review of Foreign Affairs. E.B. Berlin Protocol.

a) C.F.M. Vital need = good Secretariat.

e) War Crimes: Agreemt. to be signed to-morrow. Hope trials

h) Balkans: Commn on oil equpmt: powers of B. &amp; U.S. repns on

b) Reparations. R. removals v. drastic. On percentages – had to yield to R. pressure, largely because U.S. willing to make concessions. c) German Fleet. Subs. – satisf. solution. Merchant Fleet: 1/3rd subject to U.S.S.R. satisfying Polish claims. d) Koenigsberg: Final settlement reserved to Peace Settlement: but will be fait accompli before then. will go on. U.S.’s anxieties about Hess. f) Austria: no reparations agreed. g) Poland W. Frontier: discussions with repns of P.P.G. Want to talk with C/R. &amp; B/T. – insist tht. Poles live up to undertakgs: then trade ?exch will open from that area. C.C.’s must see this new formula is carried out.

i) Transfer of Populations. V. serious problems. Conduct of D.P.’s. j) Inland Waterways. R. reluctant to duscuss. U.S. &amp; B. think

it important. But R agreed to serve on I.T.O.

P.M. Was there throughout. Not much done before our return. E.B. did v. well at short notice inpickg. up unknown threads. Diffy – whatever your ideas the facts keep moving on – e.g. Poland’s W. Frontier. R. ideas of repns – same delusions as we had in 1918. Don’t care, either, what happens to W. Europe. Not done too badly. E.B. R. pressure tht. Ruhr be declared part of Germany. Many ideas about that – considered on A.P.W. Cttee. Now to be examined by C.F.M. We shall have to watch our security. E.Sh. Moscow agreemt. tht. 8 yrs. 50 m. tons G. coal to be ready for export. Shall have to raise that issue. P.M. Food &amp; fuel for Berlin this winter. Surplus food areas &amp; Silesian mines both under R. control. Got nearer to agreemt. with R. on this – thro’ decision to treat G. as economic whole. A.B. Brutal behaviour by Czechs. in clearing out Germans. P.M. Cdn’t do more than we did on this – askg. Govts. to hold their hands. C.E. Anxiety on Tyneside re reparations shipping comg. to U.K. P.M. Alive to need for protecting our bldgs. J.J.L. Shortage as acute last time: then v. embarrassing abundance.

H.M. Congratns to CRA. &amp; EB. on pulling it off at Potsdam. W.A.J. War crimes: fear trials may make us look ridiculous. Procedure = mixture of R. &amp; U.S. procedure. Risk of going on for months. Need to impress on them tht. we must get on quickly. 3. Tangier. E.B. While we were weak, Sp. establd illegal regime in Tangier.

Ques. now: will R. Govt. meet Sp. Govt. They have gt. interests there. We have trade interests. Postponed twice. Must meet this week. Suggest begin by trying to bring in Spain as in Memo. Anxious to start on 10/8. If we attack Spain as whole, may rally them round Franco.

Don’t want to start mil. measures to clear Sp. out of Tangier.

S. Wd. be v. diff. to find air forces to support opns in this area. A.V.A. Wd. Fr. come in to talks with Spain. E.B. Yes. A.B. Risk of letting R. always have initiative. If R. insist tht. Sp. shd. not be there we shall have to exclude R. (?) Sp. no rights because assumed illegal regime. E.Sh. Wd. U.S. agree tht. Spain shd. be brought in? E.B. Yes. R.S.C. This is the right line. E.B. If R. want to back out, I won’t mind. A.B. Risk: look as tho’ we have chosen Franco vice Russians. E.B. Shall see it doesn’t look like that. [ Exit Cadogan.

4. King’s Speech. H.M. Legve p’gramme will be v. heavy. Considered Govt. policy &amp; concluded desirable to attempt list in para. 2. (ii) &amp; (iii) – need for action quick after talk. (iv) Exchange control. H.D. can do that under (iii) Validity: ? 5 years vice shorter period of 2 yrs. A. Prefer longer than 2 yrs. at once.

H.M. (x) Citrine wrote on this (and 40 hr. wk). Earlier, some ques. of wisdom of restrictg. it to ss 5 &amp; 6. Has this view bn. changed? G.I. Citrine seen &amp; favours general repeal. Not gone to Genl. Council: but no doubt of their view. W.A.J. Easier in H/C. to get straight repeal than modification. Influenced then by fact tht. H/C. was more difficult. In present circs. favour straight repeal. A.B. Are we sure we want to re-instate the old law, as it stood. R.S.C. x/ Wd. be better if you want to change it, to do so separately &amp; later.

E.B. G.I. &amp; I saw Citrine – straight repeal – am seeing draftsman to-morrow.

E.Sh. Other natn? of Power Industies.

H.M. Cdn’t deal with gas &amp; electricity this Session. Don’t believe it

E.Sh. y/ Want power of effective co-ordinn of other sources of fuel &amp; power.

Don’t want to over-emphasise Nat. Investmt. Bd.

acquisition. Referencing abolished for T. &amp; C.P. – want it

P.M. Argument: this is necessary because of rest of our p’amme – natn. H.M. That only goes to ss 5 &amp; 6. The other provisions are to go also. W.A.J. Supported x/. P.M. Vaguer words – “status of T.U.’s”. Genl. feeling in favour of bluntness. H.M. Para 4(i) Para 4(ii). Parly. procedure. Propose considn by Cab. later. P.M. a) Legislative content b) Form of speech. On b) Not enough kick at beginning. Suggest words …….. Para. 19. Amendments. as in ins. A. No refce to Doms. The new G. hope to work in close with other members of B. commonwealth in all matters of common interest. Agreed – add to para. 1. possible. H.D. Land also under (v) &amp; (vi). P.M. Add “as part of the re-organisation of power resources …..” Agreed. H.D. On 2(iii). Control of Investment Bill. New words at end/para. 11. P.M. Para. 5. Re-wording suggd by C.O.S. Agreed. P.M. Is the list in Para. 2 right? A. This + 13. Use of land. What we want is simplified procedure for abolished for housing. H.D. That is intended. A. “…….. and its more expeditions acquisition ….” Agreed: in principle, not words.

A.G. Don’t mix this tempy thing with this phrase re permanent land use. T.W. We shall in/end have to take powers to compel l’lords. T.W. In para. B add as in ins.

H.M. Priorities: if you had to deal with towns first, you wd. be charged with bad faith.

exclude that? Genl. view – don’t exclude it.

H.M. Say it when you’re about to act. Otherwise you paralyse the industry

E.B. Why not requisition land for housg. Wd. any words used here S. Para. 17 commits us to Swinton, holus bolus P.M. Omit [ ] . agreed. G.I. Decasualisation of Dock Labour? H.M. Not for K. Speech. J.W. Mention of Forth Bridge. P.M. Not in Speech. W.A.J. Pressed again for mention of electricity. meantime. Refer back to Cttee. on y/. W.W. Time-table. next week. W.S.C. will refer to Potsdam. They want a day for it. Assign 20/8. P.M. wd. be able to spk. – only by leave of House. Agreed P.M. &amp; E.B. to spk. 22/23 Aug. Separate Debate on San Francisco. P.M., Tomlinson &amp; Wilkinson shd. prob. spk., as they were there. Approval in H/Lords – same day.

Amendmt. to Address. W.S.C. not anxious: but might be when he

W.W. 15th Meet: 24th rise: 9th Oct.

sees Speech. Must therefore provide for amendmt. on21/8. Hours. 2.15 p.m. to end of year. J. Stuart agrees. P.L. Amendmt. of franchise. – want to get it through. H.O. Franchise Bills will go thro’ as agreed measure – Prob. cd. go in one Bill. A. Legn to carry on Newfoundland may be requd.

A.B. Rural Houses Rehabilitn Bill may be needed. Avoid spkg. twice in one Debate. In Party House, they may not put up with it. P.M. Consider Potsdam Debate separate from Address – shortening Address by one day. W.W. I.e. finish Address on Monday: Potsdam Tuesd: San Fr. Wed &amp; Thurs. C/E. Not v. exciting draft. Remit draft to Cttee. to report by Thursday. 5. The Cotton Industry. R.S.C. Believe they will take this if given quickly – this week-end. x/ Nec. to say we aren’t going to nationalise the industry.

E.B. Gt. mistake tht. M/L. shdn’t appt. Chairman. Dpts. like B/T.

plan.

shdn’t get into wages. R.S.C. Will accept that modification. H.D. Support this. But doubt wisdom of x/. This is all I cd. screw out of all-Party Committee. Wd. have liked to go further – as in my original proposals. Look again at my original (more drastic) R.S.C. Chance comes this week-end: not likely to arise again for some time x/ is the important thing. – during this Parlt. Wdn’t prevent acceptance of Nat. Spinning Bd. H.D. Then I agree. H.M. Wait until you are asked on x/. A.V.A. Must be asked. It was in our last Programme. A.B. P. enterprise won’t go in unless assurance given – threat of natn must be either implemented or w’drawn. E.B. Million dependent on cotton: spinning is fundamental: you’ll have to get it right: unemplt. will follow widely if you don’t. Nearly 2 3/4 m. people’s work is involved. Danger of pledging yrself. not to touch spinning for 5 years. Wd. rather say – “this is your last chance.” Not our intentn to nationalise cotton industry – give them fair chance to put themselves right – but Govt. cannot leave spinning if they don’t.

E.Sh. ? Hope they will take such measures as will make natn unnecessary.

H.M. Diffce between natn and doing nothg. You cd. still do something. E.B. Govt. conscious large no. depend - spinning end of industry. Don’t propose nationalise unless industry fails to re-organise &amp; serve best interests of the country. Agreed. R.S.C. to review wording with E.B.

6. Cabinet Committee Organisation. P.M. Outlined his ideas. Will discuss with colleagues. Then circulate. E.B. a) Ad hoc arrangemt. to meet D.O., C.O. &amp; I.O. on foreign &amp; overseas policy. Get Empire behind him. b) Ad hoc arrangemt. to meet Ty. &amp; B/T. to enable economic factors to support political. 7. Procedure: Future Meetings. P.M. Pre-war. Wed. at 11 a.m. Fair number to begin with. E.E.B. In mornings as often as possible. Thursday at 11. a.m. Next mtg.
