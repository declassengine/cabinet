C.M. 57(45). 29th November, 1945. 1. Parliament. H.M. Vote of Censure – muddled, but it is a V. of C. Can’t deny facilities. Bias for 1 day because finance, oppies on Budget = demobn,

Ch. Whip wants legn by 11.12 because H/Lds. Opposn cd

a day already &amp; Address: housing, ditto. &amp; wide debate on recent Bill. . stop that

chance, wh. they wdn’t get in 1 day.

H.M. Precedent: want to break that.

if annoyed over V. of C. P.M. If 2 days given they won’t press for day on Palestine. H.M. Our people want to discuss Pal. – better done before Xmas. P.M. Precedents favour 2 days. W.W. Opposn promise give no legn by 11/12 if 2 days given for this. Our supporters want to speak – 5 maidens already – give them the A.B. a) Then 4 Front Bench speeches. W.W. 3 wd. be enough. A.B. b) The V. of C. is against Electorate not Govt. 2 days is too much.

Wed/Thurs. V. of C.

P.M., H.M. &amp; R.S.C.

H.M. Secret Sessions.

A. If by that you can get legn to H/L by 11/12 it’s worth it. Trouble if we’re pushed too late. P.M. Balance in favour of 2 days, makg. it clear tht. it’s no precedent for x/ future. Wd. gain time in the end. Agreed: as at x/. Next week. Mon/Tues. Cttee – Building &amp; Elections &amp; Jurors. Friday. Rpt &amp; 3rd Rdg. Bldg &amp; E &amp; J. Speakers in V of C. 1. 3. 2.

responsibility on Govt.

P.M. Go ahead. House authies want it. Agreed.

&amp; ask whose initiative. Can’t understand their attitude. They now say premature &amp;

369

H.M. Bretton Woods. Bill itself = simple. If therefore agreemt. with

Chair &amp; Oppn, broad debate on Finance, Comm. Policy and B. Woods. 2 days. P.M. Is Bill necessary. ?Resolution in first instance.

H.M. Ty. satisfied there must be Bill.

Genl. debate: then get Bill thro’ on the nod. H.D. Our ratification must be by Act/Parlt. Shall need 2 days. Genl. debate &amp; arrangemt. that simple Bill will

go thro’ with v. little Debate, prs. sitting late on 2nd day. P.L. Will have to pass H/Lds also, before 31/12. [Exit Whiteley. 2. Times of Cabinet.

Second day – Tuesday is best.

R.S.C. Early mtgs awkward – because daily mtgs with Dept.

H.D. Wed. a.m. Get Party mtgs reduced. More interest now in Groups.

Wd. support 9.15.

Mondays: 11. a.m.

3. Financial and Commercial Policy.

P.M. Not afternoons. Thursday mtg. essential. Must therefore be early because Standing Cttees. Points to mtg. at 9 or 9.15. H.M. Moment not ripe. You wd. have to have at least fortnightly mtgs. P.M. Leave Weds. pro. tem. Monday at 11 a.m.? H.M. Thursday at 9.45 or 10.? Thursdays 10. a.m. H.D. Consultns procdg. V. difficult. Legal points.

a) U.S. may stick at 4. Good chance, however, of 41/2. L.L. 750 m.

b) 2 II. is last minute suggn of U.S. Had thght. U.S. wished to see

Congress might say loan is to bail out Sterling area.

accept if necessary.

May boil up quickly at any minute. Paper shows best we can do. Cab. must decide wtr. it is good enough or wtr they wd. prefer to break. rather than 500 m. to wh. we earlier thght. we cd. reduce it. easemt. in Sterling area. They fear however tht. w’out 2 II My advisers believe tht. it wdn’t in fact make any diff. to our opn – tho’ diff. to explain in H/C. Advise therefore try to omit but

370

c) Waiver. Doubtful wtr. U.S. will accept. 4 I. wd. be pretty

satisfactory. We have eliminated U.S. claims to audit our

R.S.C. No: the more we

reserves &amp; criticise our dom economy. E.Sh. “Home-produced exports.” Excludes shippg. freights &amp; oil fr. M/East. R.S.C. Doesn’t matter because comparative with 36/1938. If out then, out now. This is a v. good formula, if we can get it. A. Concluding words of 4 II. New? H.D. Yes. Better form than U.S. previous. H.M. Better without the concludg. words.

can take into a/c, the better, in deciding what we pay.

H.M. But wd. let them argue we shd. pay them quick as others.

E.B. Thought it favoured us. General agreement this is in our favour. H.D. d) Sterling area. U.S. pressing us to complete in one year - &amp; deny us the benefit of 5 yr. transition period of B. Woods. This formula is more roomy- “make arrangemts.” by end/46 …. current earnings. Smaller part of problem. The larger part is the capital indebtedness, accumulated balances. And that, under 6 II, has no fixed time limit: vid (c). E.Sh. This throws open U.S. market to these sterling areas. U.S. will use this to hamstring our export trade. H.D. Don’t assume Sterling area arrangemts. wd. continue if this broke

down.

S. Africa for example wants to get into U.S. markets. Can’t hold Sterling area unless we remove temptn to go into closer relations with U.S. R.S.C. Inconvertibility is not foundn of sterling area – that is war-time incident. Vitality of the area depends on convertibility of sterling. P.L. This is not agreed document. It is proposal for submn to U.S. 6 I formula hasn’t bn. put to K. He &amp; Mission take view tht. we are pledged to go further. Viz., to release by end/46 on 6 I. Agree therefore to try this formula: but wd. be mistake to break on this minor point. Ty. shd. have latitude to close with something less favourable on 6 I. P.M. We must decide our sticking point.

371

A.B. What about Aust. &amp; N.Z.? A. Not so awkward as S. Afr. But they are uneasy about the Sterling area.

A. 6 III shd. follow 6 I. It comes into opn then. }

} R.S.C. No: not until stored sterling also made convertible. } G.H. Sterl. balances in Colonies – will they be affected. Will these be written down? H.D. Yes: but by negotiation. P.M. x/ Is it wise to mention “written off”. “Adjustment” or some such phrase wd. be better. R.S.C. All covered by “voluntary agreement”. E.Sh. If you look to bilateral arrangemts with Sterling countries, will they

agree if they know this provides for convertibility to dollars.

H.D. e) 7 I. Have avoided any hindrances to exch. restn to prevent cap.

H.D. Promised to consider working as at x/. movemts. – viz. this relates only to current transactions. This is acceptable. E.Sh. Does this mean we shan’t be impowered to import U.S. goods. R.S.C. No: doesn’t deal with that. It will prevent blocking Sterling earned here by U.S. films, save under general provns of B. Wood.

to get if fr. N.Z., we shdn’t be able to restrict its import fr. U.S.

E.W. Cd. it be evaded – e.g. by excessive salaries for U.S. citizens working here. R.S.C. Cdn’t do anything substantial on those lines. R.S.C. f) 7 II is difficult. Under Trade Agreemt. (wh. hasn’t bn. substantially altered since it came to Cabinet) …… 7 II won’t apply generally under that but specially as betwn. us and U.S. It is special additional restn. Quoted. This means e.g. if we want to stop U.S. cars we must stop all cars. Mght. lead to this diffy. Supposg. we wanted import P. milk &amp; hadn’t dollars &amp; wanted Answer: in non-discrimy regs. in section C. You can take into a/c normal channels of pre-existing trade – e.g. you can reject the spot-lot w’out “discrimination”. Need therefore to get it clear tht. this phrase “does not discriminate” means the same as non-discrimination under Trade Agreement. Propose to do this

372

by exchange of notes. H.M. Thought B. Woods over-rode any prev. arrangemt. inconsistent therewith. Better to rely on that? R.S.C. 7 II is outside context of B. Woods. Wdn’t work. G.H. W. Afr. Produce Bd. purchasing fr. W. Africa. R.S.C. P.12. Sect. E. para. 1. Long-term arrangement cd. be prayed in aid. G.H. Trade may be sometimes on basis not commercial. Leads into Pref. ques. P.M. Shall we go ahead or break off. E.Sh. More convinced than ever that I was right in entering my caveat. Ball not wholly at U.S. feet. They have to get rid of products – if they can’t they’ll face serious industrial crisis. If they were Socialist country they cd. do w’out exports. But they aren’t. We, as creditors, never sought to hamstring trade &amp; currency of our

debtors.

We shd. stand on one leg. We must have resources. U.S. can find them. Then on what terms? This offer = 2% &amp; condns. I wd. rather borrow at up to 5% than accept these condns. Don’t believe planned economy in U.K. is compatible with these agreemts. The Finance Agreemt. bad enough – designed enable U.S. to get strangle-hold on trade of the world. B. Woods wd. be acceptable with a satisf. Trade Agreemt. Only had this memo. this a.m. We shdn’t have foisted on us a

document of this importance w’out sufft. opportunity of considg.

its effects on our Dpl. policy. Concerned re oil &amp; oil equipment (wh. we largely export). Same must apply to other Dpts. Suggest

each Dpt. shd. examine effects on its policy

Was discussed here – genl. issue – before. Nothg. new here rushed

Comm. Policy circd days ago.

P.M.’s section – effect on our internal economy. Suppose we decide not to accept, what wd. it mean? U.S. wd. be unable to export its surplus. Re-action in M/West – with effect on Congress &amp; U.S. public opinion. Believe this will be fatal to prospects of planned economy. Finally, political effect – puttg. ourselves in pawn to U.S. for years. Internal matters like housing mght. affect publ. mind less than this. P.M. Ec. Sect. have examd &amp; are in agreemt. on Cab. Can’t have these matters examd Deplly. E.B. Reached pt. for unpleasant decn. 373

Have eliminated most of pts. wh. were specially inimical to planned economy. Faced idea of loan at higher rate. On facts decided we cdn’t do that. Over 2 m. a year, beginning now. We don’t have to take up this credit unless we find it necessary. This = overdraft . Don’t run off and take it all. w’out trying hardest to reduce need. Problem: beginning European trade. Can’t get it going w’out dollars.

E.g. Yugoslavia – amount we can do ourselves is v. small.

be emphasised during discn in Congress.

then blame for all the consequences wd. be assigned to

Hungary - real chance there of getting behind the curtain. Resisted this sort of bargain as long as I cd. Now satisfied we must settle. A.B. Diff. to establ. relationship betwn. Fin. &amp; Comm. agreement. Share view expd by E.Sh. U.S. pursuing policy of grab. Our relation with U.S. poisoned by this approach. Suppliant. Will Their need for exports is greater than ours for money P.M. But it’s only 5%. A.B. They need to build it up – to export their unemplt. And its localised. If we refused, what wd. be effect in U.S.? Electric. G.B. back in the lead. A new start in our commercial relations. Buying short-term relief in exchange for long-term diffies. Want to be recorded as dissenting if decision taken to-day. Wd. prefer not to have it decided to-day &amp; put in memo. of views. H.M. Don’t believe this is a clever U.S. plot. What is position? We want dollars. L.P. Cttee constantly refuses projects for lack of dollars. W’out them we are in for period of austerity such as we haven’t yet faced. Believe U.S. genuinely anxious to get internatl trade right. E.Sh. seems to want planned economy at home in an anarchical world. Don’t like rush. But postponement may give us worse choice. P.L. E.Sh. assumes we cd. get loan at higher rate w’out strings. In fact K. has said they wdn’t give it. Choice is this – or face hostile U.S. &amp; no dollars. Favour accepting this: indeed giving latitude to give a bit more to get it. V. unlikely that, if we rejected, U.S. wd. come to heel. H.D. Advantage of this, as cpd. with a break, wd. be enormous. Austerity of doing w’out this wd. wreck this Govt. Initial cheers, incompetence of Labour Govt.

374

R.S.C. Trade Agreemt. only hope of getting order in internat. trade. We have excluded everythg. we opposed: &amp; secured incln of all we asked for. Wd. commend this even if there were no Financial Agreemt. P.M. { Generally agreed. { Latitude to C/Exch. on point raised by P.L. E.Sh. I can’t accept this. A.V.A.} Don’t like this, but J. }

A.B. We shall have to face consequences. 375
