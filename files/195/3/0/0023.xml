W.M. 48(45). 20th April, 1945. 1. Building Labour Allocations. P.M. Reference to Housing Squad decisions. M/L. Doesn’t affect these allocations of existing force in bldg. P.M. Cd. not a larger share, even of what is available, be given to housing. Referred to excessive allocation for Admy. A.V.A. Two main purposes a) to vacate school &amp; other educational purposes. M/L. Willing to have someone make re-examn of allocns in light of new Man Power assumption. P.M. Time now to whittle down Service Dpt. requirements &amp; demands. I wd. cut your allocation by 8.000. P.J. Allocation for new W.O. works is only 3.000. The rest is maintenance on accommn for 2 m. men in fixed camps &amp; barracks. P.M. How many men in it. P.J. 600.000 B. &amp; prob. 4/500.000 U.S. [Later verified at 434.000 U.S. P.M. Why do you want any new works? Now is the time to start cutting at Service demands. A.V.A. Pointed out that allocn of 17.000 means coming down to that from 21.000 in Jan. H.O. But June figures for Service &amp; Supply Dpts is excessive as cpd. with Housing. J.A. 150.000 empld Jan: reduced to allocn of 100.000 in June. P.J. Don’t forget the further 140.000 empld on Ldn. repairs. M/S. .. .. that M/S. allocn covers much work on industrial reconversion. Not purely for mil. purposes: much civil work in it. D.S. Standard of maintenance in Service Dpts. is higher than civil. P.J. Was examined by Portal &amp; found not excessive.

M/S. W’out this control, industry wd. buy the labour – &amp; then wd. be none at all for housing. W. Pare Service Dpts in 3rd quarter’s allocation. P.M. Let this allocation pass – on understanding tht. in next quarter Service allocns are reduced by 1/3rd (not to extend to M/Supply). 40.000 target for Services. Mil. accommn cd. be reduced from 2 m. to 1 m. P.J. To start with, 160.000 G. p.o.w. and prob. as many Italians. P.M. 600.000 B. 400.000 p.o.w. Then need you keep 1 m. places for U.S. P.J. Glad if you wd. ask them to reduce. M/H. ? Examine Admy figures – A.V.A. a) F.A. Arm Airfields. b) HMS Vernon. c) concrete barges &amp; floating docks for l.c. for Jap war. W.O. Only 3% of the total is on W.O. new works. P.M. My criticisms to-day will be on everyone’s lips 6 months hence. M/W. Pass April/May. Put June into next quarter. M/L. Can’t plan allocations beyond V(E) Day. Thereafter, basis to be changed – with the larger pool. Prob. after July. M/W. Most urgent need is to scrutinise new works. P.M. No new works over £100 to be started w’out ref. to W. Cab. M/S. Impossible. Example: much of this labour = new works for Penicillin. clearing out factories for reconversion. M/L. Considering another regn of building labour- to increase labour force. Sure we shall get for housing enough labour – when it begins to flow. Agreed: Approve allocations for April &amp; May. For June: allocations for Serv. Dpts. 50.000. or. rather, 50.000 by end July. P.J. Objected to allocn for M/W. (repair of Govts. Dpts): same no. as for Army. M/W. Promised to consider reductions.

P.M. No new works for Admy. w’out my consent. {Enter W.S.M. and R.S.H. Agreed { And all 2nd class categories to be reduced pro rata. Allocn Cttee to review { Target: Gleanings to be added to housing. 20.000 June/July. { 2. Coal: Release of Miners from H.M. Forces. M/L. Described means of increasing mining force by 10.000 vice 20.000 desired – as in Memo. P.J. The increase to 200.000 is what we will aim at – if things go well. Not firm figure. [Standstill will be only 6 wks.] Will depend on decns on extent of redeployment. P.M. Redeployment. We must deploy as much as shipping can carry. P.J. Urgent need for decisions on scale of operations in Far/East. P.M. x/ Want a minimum of 300.000 from Germany &amp; Italy: in first 3 months or so: not all wd. be released, prs. 250.000. P.J. Can’t be done. P.M. Why not – once enemy is disarmed. Will consider that on Def. Cttee. P.J. x/ wd. involve redn in scale of deployment v. Japan. Problem wd. be reduced if Australian Divns. cd. go vice British. M/W. Agree with Memo. H.G. Situation (on increase of 10.000 only) will be serious – as in W.P. 262. Will have to report to Cab. what effects wd. be. P.M. Add to para 9(a) of memo – increase to 275.000. A.S. No good putting a definite figure on it. Diffy of finding men for Far East commitments. 9(a) – to maximum possible: target 250.000: exact figure to be settled when scale of opns in F/East worked out. (Figures = Army only. P.J. Won’t be possible on present assumptns re F/East. Not more than 150.000. Record. P.M. No delay in workg. out: but may be that figures may be modified in light

of F/East decisions. [Exit M/Supply. 3. Housing: Temporary Houses in Open Spaces. M/H. Majority of Housing Cttee agree. Had thought it wd. be controversial. Don’t think it will. P.M. No harm in this – if l.a. must initiate. Wd. not apply to R. Parks. M/H. 2.000 in London. Won’t all be in Parks. Wd. hope to avoid commons. W. O.K. – protection = l.a. must apply. P.M. Allotments must give way to houses. M/L. Opposed it at first because risk to open spaces. As now restricted, don’t object. M/H &amp; M/W} Want Cab. authority to get the Bill quickly. U.S. houses, for example. T.C.P. } J.A. a) “Open space” definition won’t do for the diffr. purposes of this Bill. b) Don’t exclude commons: but be careful about it. M/H. Agreed to consider – for Legn Cttee. P.M. Projects under the Bill – cd. they go into H/C. Library. H.O. Safeguard there = T.C.P. certificate. Agreed. [Exit: M/H, T.C.P. and M/W. 4. Pork, Bacon and Eggs. M/Ag. Agreed with M/F. &amp; M/W.T. P.J. 300.000 t. of shipping immed. after V(E) Day. May it be understood tht. this will not interfere with F/East cargo shipping requirements? L. Those requiremts. not yet defined. But still belief surplus/shipping in 3 months after V. day. W. Must maintain the supply after the 3 months. L. If we get in a gt. store in 3 mos. we can peddle it out. W. Want assurance.

L. 300.000 t. in ’45 I believe I can do. W. What of 1946? L. Can’t say. Hope it will be alright: but can’t be committed yet. M/Ag. Surely shipping situation shd. be appreciably better by end/46. A.S. Sting in the tail. Immediate announcemt. will commit us before M/W.T. can commit himself! L. I will manage ’45. Pretty sure we shall be able to do a good deal in ’46. Must make a start sometime on this. P.J. U.S. C.O.S. are seekg. to establish over-riding priority for personnel shipping for F/East: &amp; doubtless will extend that to cargo. P.M. Won’t agree to priorities w’out allocations. Agreed. [Exit: R.S.H. M/W.T. 5. Control of Employment (Civil Servants) Order. J.A. As in Memo. H.G. My Dpt. 85% tempy. - need something. But this is one-sided: he has no appeal against dismissal. J.A. But under D. Work Order you can get rid of redundant staff. P.M. In favour of the Memo. - dirty civilians need have no consideration. H.G. This goes up to 60. What of comparison with office-soldiers. Can we have same condns for temp. &amp; permanent. J.A. Will try to meet the hard cases. But fear a landslide. Must give the staff as a whole the impression of fair dealing. W. For those of mil. age the case is quite clear. P.J. W.O. &amp; Admy originally objected because we. have had to satisfy each establmt that condns/ service were reasonable. That doesn’t apply now. Don’t therefore object. H.O. Want it applied to permanent staff, too. P.M. Steady percentage release: but right to prevent landslide. Be generous to the women – esp. the young ones.

M/L. The Serv. Dpts. shd. constantly review the Womens’ Services – with a view to rapid reductions. P.M. And release rate needn’t correspond precisely with the men’s. Wd.like a target. 3 months from V(E) day any who don’t want to stay cd. go. P.J. That wdn’t to at all. No hasty generalisation. 6. Transfer of Warships to Canada &amp; Australia. J.A. Ships worth £11 m. requested as a loan. They may prefer to pay for these, rather than give us dollars. P.M. Australia - I defer to J.A.’s view. Point out deterioration in our financial posn in reln to theirs &amp; suggest they might pay for the ships. PUCL D.O. want a free gift &amp; recover: as in Memo. A.V.A. We would get more out of them that way. P.M. Here are ships: our fin. posn makes it nec. for us to ask the equivalent in whatever way is most convenient. 7. Compulsory Military Service. P.M. Spoke in high commendn of para 8. of W.P. 242. M/L. Procedure. Our idea was for leaders to consult responsible people in Party, before an announcemt. made. Econ. side - with raising of school-age this wd. remove 3 age-groups from industry &amp; commerce. Age: wd. like flexibility between 17½ and 22. All these implications shd. have bn. worked out before we consult our Parties. Background of national will before we announce. H.O. Risk of leak: but better than blank announcemt. followed by a row. P.M. Can’t wait to work out details. M/L. Not of plan – but of implications. A.S. Govt. have agreed on principle of mil. courses for length of troubled times after the war. Is that what we consult about. Their reactions &amp; suggns.

M/L. Discuss the principle. Here are the facts tht. force us to it. Don’t discuss the details. Believe we can carry them with us. What they will want to end is tht. all Parties shd. say the same. At Leeds I asked tht. Defence &amp; Foreign Policy shd. be above Party Politics. Fan mail has bn. good on this. A.S. Popular in theory – diff. in practice. Negotn with my Party: best approach wd. be strong lead: we’ve decided. What do you say, what suggns have you to make. P.M. That is my instinct, too. H.O. But difft. methods for difft. Parties. For Labour Party that method of approach wd. invite diffy. P.M. Don’t fear a leak: wdn’t worry about that: fear a dusty answer. Agreed: defer for a few days decision on procedure. 8. Polish National Day. P.M. If it were a united Polish Day, good &amp; well. But this London Govt. – no. R.L. Trouble in H/C. fr. Polish enthusiasts &amp; a bit shabby. But certainly the Poles wd. make use of it if it went. On balance, I’m against going this year. Wonder if P.M. wd. issue a message to the Polish people. P.M. That wdn’t be popular with any section. Think we shd. be repd unless in the interval there has bn. a change in the Pol. Govt. Suggest M/State shd. go representing A.E. We recognise them until we can get a free Pol. Govt. J.A. &amp; A.S. Indicated agreement.
