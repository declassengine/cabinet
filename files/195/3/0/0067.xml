C.M. 49 (45) 6th November 1945. 1. Parliament. Debate on Foreign Affairs: 7th November E.B. Don’t want to follow W.S.C., who will open. P.M. Want to hear what H/C. as a whole will have to say. H.M. OK: but on next occasion E.B. shd. come in early. E.B. My main point – shall look at all in light of action by U.N.O. [Exit Whitely] 2. Prisoners of War. Repatn of Italians E.B. As in memo. T.W. Not just at this moment because completion of potato harvest 3.000 on 3/12 + 2.000 at mid. Dec. however accepted &amp; already agreed. M/W.T. We can move them. J.J.L. No objn Agreed: as modified. E.B. Consider: but not decide now: when Armistice terms raised, allow Italians to stay on contract for wages, not as p.o.w. [Enter N.B. &amp; Hynd.] Want this studied by Offl. Cttee – agreed. M/L to take the lead. [Exit Barnes] 3. Refugees: Admission of Distressed Persons C.E. 1.500/2.000. applns a week – estimated. Can’t go beyond categories set out. Don’t expect thanks from advocates: but wd. make some contn. E.B. On para. 7. will this announcement be postponed for U.S. prior agreement? C.E. No: suggest only getting them in afterwards. E.B. Wd. prefer, w’out makg. it a condn of our doing it, to ask them first. If we act first, the’ll do nothing. C.E. I’m under gt. pressure in H/C. Can’t easily wait – beyond Thursday of next week. 315

E.B. Will do it at once – may get reply before then. P.M. Danger of getting too many aged by this means. H.M. Dynamite – other re-actions. Nervous of as high an age as 18/21. We took more than U.S. before: they never expanded their quota. Danger of wave of anti-semite feeling. E.Sh. How many likely to come under this? Prob. v. small. Older people – no gt. objn because they will die off soon. More objn to younger. But, anyway, has U.K. ever suffered fr. admisn of refuges? Usually gained. Not sure about H.M., &amp; re-action. Look at counter re-action in Hampstead. On man-power, possibility we may be short. C.E Diffy because of congregating in colonies eg. Hampstead. Maintenance: propose tht. relatives be asked to satisfy us on that in advance. = part answer on “old people” point. E.B. Need to spread these people. They are good on the land. Make it a condn tht. some of young ones go on to the land. Let Dpts consider that. x/ Don’t let all Jews go into “trade”. Replace man-power wh. agric. is losing. A.B. Don’t be stampeded by D. Mail propaganda. Fact is large nos. have enterd factories etc., in Midlands &amp; N. Wales. No real analysis of what these refugees are doing. Can’t allow continn of situation in wh. children in G. camps &amp; parents here. Need for more labour here. Unwise to think in terms of unemployment. H.D. y/ Refugees who have establd industries, eg. in development areas. Tried to get assurance on their continuance. C.E. That comes up on item 4. R.S.C. Shd. not prejudice our getting over tech. specialists. C.E. It won’t. E.W. They shd. go into T. Unions – so as not to become traders. P.M. Admit principles, but need for careful administration. T.W. Supported x/. c) 18.000 Foreigners in RAF. They wd. be allowed to apply on behalf of relatives. [Exit Hynd]

4. Naturalisation Policy P.M. a) Why 2 years to get it through? i.e. work off backlog. Pressure for special facilities for Forces. C.E. a) is a ques. of staff. No enquiries made into their cases. Nos. enlisted in Pioneers in lieu of interment. Many enlisted abroad &amp; never came here. P.M. Why not exclude these classes. R.S.C. Why not naturalise automatically all who served? H.M. (i) differentiatg. between transmigrates. (ii) H.O. must be satisfied they will be good citizens. Black market by aliens in war. E.B. Two years before demobiln complete. Many foreigners want to get natd first. Are you going to be satisfied what jobs they are going to do? Armed Forces: treat service as residence. P.M. Why diff. to deal with 10 year residents? Character known. Why not take only the good people from Armed Forces. H.D. Put higher the refugees at y/ in Min. 3. No case for holding those up. C.E. If a rpt certifies natn desirable in interests of U.K. those can be taken up now. H.D. Many of my cases blocked hitherto. E.Sh. Object to method proposed in memo. Principle shd. be: subject to residence, good character. That rules our the bad hats anyhow. Establmt of good character = matter of adminn. Why therefore exclude persons of good character who haven’t applied. C.E. 6.500 outstanding. b) a no. of people haven’t applied because know it wdn’t go, Don’t want to be unjust to those who have reasonably w’held their applns. Don’t want to bring y/ into this scheme: they might be worse off. Will consider means of increasing of the flow, provided back-log is worked off. Will consider what Cab. has said re Service cases. P.M. Cdn’t you pick out the best of 6.500 - &amp; also best of the Service cases. Get on with those. Work them off quicker: and give more room for discretion for remainder.

317

C.E. Will consider pre – 1940 cases. Will say appln can now be made &amp; will be considered on merits. J. Advisory Cttee on 18B. Cdn’t you use same system for natn cases. Might help to put them into categories. A.B. Further classification. a) Service cases: naturalise w’out enquiry, P.M. Not safe. R.S.C. More discretion – and ease up on y/. A.B. Need for B nationty for business men to enable them to travel. G.A.I. Can H/O. notify M/L. so tht. labour controls can be applied. 5. Greece E.B. As in memo. Called special attentn to proposal for lottery loan. Mentioned leakage of this in News Chronicle to-day. Thro’ Lobby Correspondent. Before any thing said to Leeper or Grk. Govt. Importance of re-establishing roads &amp; rlways. Labour Members who have bn. out there now urge that we shd intervene in Greece. My policy: can’t get back to democr. there w’out reports. But now think time to stress economic vice political side. From Ty. angle must take case: drain on us for 2 yrs. more because troops. But if we can restore their economy, we cd. strike favourable balance in the end. i.e. by spending more money for 6 months might save expend’re on troops for remaining 18. H.D. Qua. U.N.R.R.A. propose hold back £5m fr. our contn of £80m. for Greece &amp; similar countries. Greece has nearly £40m gold, dollars &amp; sterling – large reserves for so small a country. No case therefore for loan. Trouble = inflation, more money than goods. That’s why I support lottery loan. Must get flow of imports &amp; absorb purchasing power. E.B. Must be able to get support of B/T. on supplies. e.g. steel rails if not available fr. U.S. P.M. No announcement? E.B. No. N.B. U.N.R.R.A. saved big infln in June. Big programme. Two defects a) staff not good enough. Galc has made some changes. U.S. head shd. be changed too.

318

Transport, not U.R.R.A.’s fault. Big results from small help on that. J.J.L. “Advisors” on Army. Mil. Mission there already under Major Genl. Racohius. E.B. Want now to get Army developmnt. brought into line with econ. policy. J.J.L. Big sacrifice – 2 Divns. is Greece getting any more stable? H.M. Does E.B. think he can pull this off? E.B. Can’t risk doing nothing. Must tell Greeks can’t keep our Divns. there for ever. [Exit Cadogan] 6. International Labour Conference: Philadelphia G.A.I. a) Social Insurance. Defer. Dependent Territories. Accept. H.M. 73 goes rather far. Giving informn to I.L.O. on measures taken. Goes deep into policy. Also risk of overlap in the other international bodies concerned with this ques. Cd. we not reserve the point re informg. I.L.O. H..D. Rpt. cd. be made in general terms. E.Sh. More than that. Unless U.S. adopt this p. works policy, their alternative wd. be investment policy wh. wd. be dangerous to us. R.S.C. It is only p. works. Not investment etc., policy. N.B. These matters are going to come under other organs. of U.N.O. Must be co-ordinated under Ec. &amp; Social Council of U.N.O. Inter-deptl consultn needed x/ soon to get this straight. G.A.I. I.L.O. is considering its new relationship to U.N.O. This will work out. Agreed: subject also to x/. 7. Washington Talks. Financial Questions H.D. Early memo indicatg. diffies if L.L. disappeared. Did disappear. Talks over 2 mos. Till now no positive proposals cd. be submitd to Cabinet. For long no U.S. talk. Reduced exports &amp; increased imports durg. war. Can’t pay out way until balance restored. Period = 3 years even with most extreme export drive. $ 4 bill. requd to bridge that 3 year gap.

Also v. large sterling debts – over £300.m owed to members of sterling bloc. Paying interest at 1% until Ty. Bill rates reduced to ½% = £15m p.a. A magnam. U.S. wd. have made L.L. retro-active. They won’t do it. Nor will they give interest free load. Best terms likely are those in 2(a) &amp; (b) of memo. (b) being accompanied by talks to get agreement. to scaling down of sterling balances w’in the bloc. Summd para. 3. Safeguards: waivers in para. 4 (a) for principal and (b) for interest. Para. 5. We are satisfied that we cd. meet even the highest alternative, which costs £40m. a year. Para. 7. We have resisted financial pressure on economical policy. But we can get this settlement we are ready to go as far as para.7. [Enter Helmore] Commercial Policy R.S.C. Revert equally to my memo of August. Invitation for comm. agreemt. came from us – taken up by U.S. when we dropped it. Originated fr. Art 7. of L.L. agreement. Attempt to set up some system of law &amp; order in internat. trade; &amp; we naturally stood to gain much from that. Proposal: U.S. will put out the document unilaterally – suggesting conferences. Not supported tht. we shd. be joint authors, but that we shd. indicate our genl. support of the document. The 14 invitees include 6 Br. 4 European &amp; only 2 S. American “attaches”. Not therefore a final document to wh. we must agree: but “general approval”. which involves obligns not to go back on pts. of principle. with wh. we have agreed. We don’t purport to speak on behalf of Doms. but we have kept them v. closely in touch &amp; they are au fait with latest position. Main results of talks. We have establd our pt. of view on every essential point on wh. we disagreed with U.S. Hardest pt. has bn Imp Preference. Original U.S. proposal was tantamount to dealing with Imp Pref. as an inherent vice to be extispated formally with bell, book &amp; candle. Latest posn = Annex. A. Thus, a matter for bargaining bi-laterally in the group of 14 as against what we can get in exchange. U.S. will be asked to say they have no objn to our using our explantn (Annex B) of the U.S. formula on Preferences. If they accept Annex B. we have come v. well out of this discussion. P.M. Remember that Coalition under a Tory P.M. accept Art 7 &amp; what it said re Preferences. 320

R.S.C. 3(a) Preamble: prevents organisation fr. pressing any measures inconsistent with full employment. (b) State trading: as in memo. (c)We have secured control over export subsidies – allowed only for limited period, ‘subj.’ to commodity research by Organsns with a view to expanding consumption or failing that agreement between countries incldg. importers as well as exporters. (d) Import quotas must not be discriminatory. d) U.S. have adopted our views on this, viza. matter for domestic law, but Organisations can receive &amp; transmit complaints. e) Agreements now satisfy. to M/Arg. Shipping &amp; civil aviation. We wanted to introduce the first into this. &amp; they wanted to bring in second. Now suggested better to have both ques. considered separately at later date. E.Sh. But affects foreign assets etc., R.S.C. So do many other things. Ques. is how much do you try to cover in Trade Agreement. M/W.T. now agree better to handle separately. Form of organisation – we’ve agreed to nothg. on that: only on these general principles. f) Are we committg. ourselves to anytg. but to discuss? R.S.C. Yes: we cdn’t go back on genl. principles with which we have agreed. J. If you get no agreemt. are you still committed? R.S.C. No. Only if we get agreement. Procedure A.B. Matter of gt. importance. Discns procdg. with knowledge of some members of Cabinet. Other members must have opportunity to study before they agree. If all inner Cabinet, rest of us have no responsibility. Nothing to be said for a mixture between that system &amp; normal system. We are now asked to reach conclusions w’out background. P.M. After general statement made by C/E &amp; B/T. to Cabinet, negotiations began &amp; touch had to be maintained with negotiators. These followed by mtgs. of Ministers mainly concerned – not an inner Cabinet. That method of conductg. business is inevitable. g) Cdn’t express an opinion on this to-day. No complaint. A.V.A. The importance of this – ruin or salvation – is such that we can’t ques. a hurried decision. 321

R.S.C. The whole background was given in my memo of Aug. That showed the problems fully. E.Sh. No complaint. But this affects econ. life of U.K. for years to come. Ready to discuss again to-day. But want to be there. And we have other engagement. E.B. Time-table now is U.S. Must go to Congress on 14/11. And speeches first by Vinson &amp; Wallace on 12 and 13/11. R.S.C. And everyone agrees that we must strike quickly to get best out of Congress. Meet again at 4.30.pm.
