C.M. 38(45). 4th October, 1945. 1. Expiry of Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts. P.M. Considered by Cttee? C.E. No. H.M. Agree. Period might have bn. longer: but cd. be covered by Expiring Laws. G.I. Cl. b. Think this right: but shd. consult employers &amp; workers acc. to promise. M/L. to do it. Agreed. 2. War Criminals. E.B. R. &amp; U.S. insist on indictg. G. general staff. Ques: is it desirable to indict the High Command as such, not individuals. They were carrying out orders of Govt. We were incldg. Keitel &amp; Jodl as individuals. But acc. to voting under W. Cr. Agreemt., 2 will carry it. E.Sh. Critical sitn y’day. We opposed because not a group or organn &amp; because orders of Govt. But U.S. say some evce tht. pre-war G. general staff diverted money to Nazi party funds. U.S. attitude due to U.S. newspp. pressure. H.M. If shown tht. G. genls. gave orders involvg. brutality etc., we shd be ill-advised to oppose. P.M. On what lines are they to be indicted? E.Sh. Group declared criminal: then indivs. to be indicted for membership of it. U.S. idea = proceed thus v. G. genl. staff. as a crim. organn. J. Under Agreemt. majority decides on trial. If U,S, &amp; R. favour it, we can’t stop it. P.M. Propose we acquiesce. Agreed. Description of Baltic States. E.B. Argument in CFM. on “Sov. national.” I refused to acquiesce in Sov. demand to declare all persons e. of Curzon Line to be Sov. citizens w’out right of option. Right of asylum. Left to dipl. channels. If we agree to this, might be quoted r. us as implying our recogn.

tht. these States are incorpd in Sov Union. E.Sh. R. reasonable with us: but won’t give way on this w’out refce to Moscow, wh. wd. wreck our time-table. E.B. No need to describe locality. Charge with crime only. E.Sh. They won’t accept that. Cd. we agree to it in R. text: but not in B. text. E.B. Awkward. Don’t want anythg. to prejudice the main issue. J. Prosecutor shd. write a lr. tht., tho’ R. describe locality thus, we don’t regard this as implying recogn of inclusion of B. States in Sov. Union. Agreed: as at x/ thro’ dipl. channel. [Exit E.Sh. 3. Indian Diplomatic Representation at Washington. P.L. Turned down by Coal. Govt. Want it re-considered – India Cttee also. Agreed. 4. Secret Sessions of Parliament. H.M. Journals don’t make it clear tht. M.P. was exonerated. Cd. get entry to that effect included. But M.P. wants make a statemt. also to H/C. &amp; constituents. Ques. then arises wtr. we shdn’t repeal D.R. &amp; leave him free to do so. On the whole, I favour this. A.V.A. May Intell. people look thro’ them first. H.M. Nothing in the Journals. P.M. Consultn with Opposn? H.M. See para. 3. No trouble over that. A. H/Lds. entries so brief tht. they convey no informn. Enter N.B. We agree. P.M. Point is: you relieve Members who were present from ban on referrg. to what happened. A.B. Under Privilege it wd. be improper – tho’ you cd. no longer prosecute. H.M. Done after last war – when D.R. expired Aug. 1921. Agreed: Publish &amp; revoke D.R.

5. Site of United States Organisation. N.B. Out-manoeuvred y’day. Agreed to private Session w’out knowg. this was to be discussed. But said at end didn’t regard as final. Case for Europe is v. strong. H.D. Don’t assume all are agreed on that. N.B. Poss. U.S. will change to E. coast e.g. Philadelphia. That might split those favourg. San Francisco. Point for Cab. now – vote at present unfair because Europe inadequ. repd. If all Eur. members present 10 votes 400.m. 21 v. for 120 m. go to Latin America. Wrong to make it final for long-term. Worse y’day because Persia, Yugosl., Czecho. occupied by R. Armies – wd. have voted diff if free. And that decided the S. Am. vote who wd. have voted for Geneva if chance of majority for it. Ask for authy to represent to Czech &amp; other Govts incldg. Doms. tht. it is wrong to have long-term decn taken on this basis. And P.M. to wire to Truman. P.M. This is only recommn wh. must come up to main body. Why do R. want U.S. N.B. To keep us out of Europe. They have changed their minds. H.D. Had this memo. come up earlier I wd. have argued tht. UNO. must contain either U.S. or Sov. or both. We look like losing Sov. That makes it the more important to keep U.S. in. Best way of doing so, is to let it have it’s H.Q. in U.S.A. On merits Canada vice U.S. But if U.S. want it, let it have it. If we still want to press for Europe, want to suggest alternative sites. E.B. No Press confce or public agitation. recommn will come up in Nov. Let it ride meanwhile. Don’t want more trouble over “procedure” after C.F.M. Want to take soundings first. A. Austr. &amp; N.Z. want it in U.S. Canada no strong view, will ride with U.S. view. Only dif. Dom. view for Europe = S. Afr. Any pressure on Doms. wd. have opp. effect to that desired. Support E.B. E.B. Byrnes isn’t keen. Let us wait &amp; see if State Dpt. take an initiative. A.V.A. M’while wd. C.O.S. be asked to give view on ques. wtr. contn of C.C.S. wd. be affected by havg. this &amp; its Mil. Cttee in U.S.A. A.B. Supported H.D. (So did Addison) 269

N.B. If it were ques. of retaing. U.S. we wd. agree with H.D. But U.S. Govt. have no policy on this. Many people think if in U.S. a) wd. become mixed up with U.S. politics b) way to brk. up isolationism is to secure stream of Americans to Europe. H.D. Further Cab. discn before final decision. Agreed: take no overt action: await developments. [ Exit N.B. [ Enter C.O.S. 6. Middle-Eastern Policy. E.B. Summd main issues. Rpt. results fr. examn in consultn with C.O.S., Dpts here (incldg. D.O. x/ &amp; C.O.) and repres in M/East. When policy begins to be reflected in improvemt of condns of the common people …….. Removal of troops fr. Egypt. Suggest careful examn of ques. of gettg. our main defences in B. territory (CIGS. spoke of Mombasa). Defence of Egypt then shd. be Anglo-Egyptian responsibility on mutual agreemt. Levant States. Talks with Bidault. Exchanges of lrs. with Molotov on w’drawal fr. Iran before 2/3/46. in acc. with Treaty. We must do that: &amp; it will clear up Iran diffies. But in Levant more awkw. posn for us. We went in for war-reasons. Spears has left us with much to live down. Yet Fr. are in worse posn still – bitterness against them. Tried for plan by wh. both w’draw: gettg. near agreemt. Fr. fear tht. if trouble then arises we shall send in troops. Or before that seek influence thro’ advisers etc. Want support clear fr. Cab. for cut decn . Fr. want assurance of our support for their claim to a base here. Not ready to give that &amp; promise only consultn at the time. Thought unwise to bring repres of Levant on to Cttee at first. Fr wd. suspect a trick. Want to establ. relns. with Fr. in wh. we can have ready consultns on all subjects. And this = test case for establ. Anglo-Fr. confidence. C.I.G.S. On x/ we are examing. No doubt good oppies at Mombasa. Diffy = road &amp; rlway commns to sea and port facilities. Wd. prevent quick movement. Considered also Cyrenaica. (if we get it). Also para 5(e). Big questions: being examined. P.L. No mention of Pol. Res. Persian Gulf – servant of G/India. Reg. co.ordn coverg. eg. oil, aviation etc. shd. include Pol. Resident. E.B. Wd. rather do it from India. If we bring in a man resident in Persia I shall be in trouble with R. P.L. You already include B. Minister Tehran. P.M. Consider doing it thro’ S/S India &amp; G/India. Agreed: F.O. &amp;

270

India Off. to consider. A.V.A. Don’t overlook defence of Suez Canal. E.B. C.O.S. must look after this in their genl. examn. A. Want authy. to talk to Doms. P.M. Two ques. a) gen. policy b) machinery E.Sh. Does 5(iii) apply to oil concessions? U.S. are seekg. them in this area &amp; we weren’t disposed to resist that. E.B. Para. 5 (iii) not intended to modify present attitude re oil. E.Sh. Will w’drawal of forces fr. Persia prejudice our oil posn. E.B. Too risky to fail to comply with Treaty obligns. R. wd. stay too. Permanent friction. P.M. This is certainly right. A.V.A. Much in favour of bringing U.S. respons. into M/East. Another matter to seek facilities for concns. to U.S. – might provoke diffy. with Russia. E.Sh. Only ask Cab. bear in mind our oil interest = big foreign asset. Agreed: watch the oil posn: genl. understanding tht. it wd be useful to get U.S. polit. respons. in these areas. A.B. P.4 of memo. Arab League. Ad hoc relations enough. They have caused so much diffy. Don’t re-inforce it by establg. regular contacts. E.B. They are there. Read in conjunctn. with Def. proposals. But will keep as informal as possible. G.H. a) We will co-operate to the full. Can’t help much with Scientific Staffs. b) Strategic. Want Cyprus posn considered again in light of this. C.O.S. to report. G.I. Shd. We delay I.L.O. Confce on M/East? E.B. Yes: too early. Can’t get results yet: no pt. in gettg. resolutions. Wd. only produce disappointment. Agreed: { Policy approved: subject to points above. { Machinery .. : E.B. Minister at Beirut will be left out for time being. 7. Palestine. 271

P.M. Ask that Washington Telegram be read. Read out by N.B. U.S. misunderstand the facts. Don’t realise tht. immigration of Jews = the issue. H.M.. a) Widespread misunderstanding of the facts. Implication tht. this 100.000 will solve European problem. In fact, millions - &amp; not all Jews. Statement tht. Jews are still being ill-treated in concentn camps in Europe. Cd. something be done to give the facts. b) Danger tht. anti-Semitism be provoked here &amp; in U.S. Method of explaining facts: Debate or W. Paper v. unhappy. means. Perhaps Press Confce when P.Q. answered. F.O. &amp; C.O. to handle. Or any other means? G.H. Intended to suggest prepn of Press before P.Q. Tension in Palestine as well as in U.S. No soln. can please both sides. No ques. tht. in Pal. they are lining up for trouble. Timing of P.Q. earliest date 23/10 fr. mil. pt. of view. P.M. Initiative will pass from us. Questions already down – more will follow. Will be demand for debate. We can’t hold off any statement until troops are there. E.Sh. a) There will be anti-Semitism anyway. That needn’t influence it. b) Futile to think of passing buck to U.S. c) This must be related to retn. in Europe. We haven’t the facts on that. First step: ascertain facts in central Europe &amp; do our best to remedy any evil condns disclosed. We shd. declare out intentns. on that – our whole-hearted desire to improve the lot of Jews in Europe. Suggest therefore use of formula “Pendg. considn by U.N.O., to whom we propose to refer ques. we are takg. immed. steps to ameliorate condns of people concerned.” That is the line we shd. take – P.M. announcing in H/C. Cd we not send out a Commn at once. P.M. But there is no allegn of our ill-treatmt. of Jews. It is in U.S. Zone. I’m not going to say in H/C anythg. wh. implies any ill-treatmt in our Zone. E.Sh. V. well: make that clear in statement in H/C. And put it up to U.S. Govt. tht they shd do something in their Zone. H.M Does E. Sh. know what propn of Jews want to leave Europe? N. For 20 yrs. assocd with Jews &amp; Palestine. Displaced persons in B. Zone &amp; no serious complaints of treatment. Earl Harrison’s rpt. related to U.S. Zone primarily &amp; related to sitn earlier than August.

My informn a) 4/500.000 Polish d.p.’s. 20/25.000 are Jews. b) German Jews mostly retd to homes in Germany. b) have no business, house or possessns &amp; returng. to bitter memories of persecution. Feel imposs. to settle in Germany. Relatively few in number. a) no complts. re treatment - except prs. that come fr. camps where phys. &amp; moral condn v. bad, while non-Jewish Poles are in better state, because they’ve bn. working. In same camps. Diffy. because P. Liaison Offr. give leadership of camps to Xiau Poles. Trouble mainly over desire not to return to Poland. Form of statement proposed is rather cold. G.H. Intend to amend it. N. Ministers man had no convns. With Weismann. – moderatg. influence in being undermined because he has not had contact with P.M., F.O. or C.O. G.H. Have met him every time he asked. E.B. I’m seeing him to-morrow. Had to put him off because of C.F.M. C.E. Mtg. y’day of Refugees Cttee. Gathered from C.O. F.O. M/State &amp; Ty. who were there that one diffy. is we haven’t declared that mere fact of Jewish naty makes a man repatriable. In U.S. camps. G. Jews are classified as stateless because of G. law. H.M. But Nuremberg racial laws repealed. C.E. Ch. Rabbi v. anxious we shd. admit to U.K. no. of people who can’t face return to own villages etc., in Germany. Shall soon be asked to define attitude to that. J. Hope whatever course we take we shan’t tie ourselves to W. Paper. Last essay in appeasement. Wrong legally because involves contd breach of Mandate. Indefensible morally. Hope we shan’t imply we are bound by W. Paper even in interim period before submn to U.N.O. Labour voted on 6. 3. 40 v. W. Paper. Hope we’ll follow E.Sh. line – promisg. [to get full informn]. Can’t neglect human problem. Let us say we are takg steps [ ]: &amp; meanwhile shall admit to Palestine the nos. up to full absorption capacity of the county. P.M. a) R., Czech, Poles are drivg them out &amp; then we are expd to put them into P. b) Don’t want to be bound by W. Paper. But what is understandg. with Arabs? E.B. Letter fr. W.S.C., ?F.D.R. Truman – promising consultn. I shall have to say this = U.S. electoral ramp. If U.S. go. on pressing it.

Big trouble if B. troops have to go in &amp; start fighting. In light of this a.m.’s discsn, I can’t help thinkg (w’out wishg. to pass the buck) no use saying puttg to the U.N.O. – will be taken as delay. Can’t decide this am. Will confer with C.O. &amp; try to put up alternative. Line 1) refer ultimate probl. of P. to U.N.O. 2) But interim probl. incldg. Jews in Europe raises manifold diffies. Refer to problems of Pol. (Pol. Army &amp; anti-semitism). Room for 50.000 in U.N.R.R.A. camps in N. Africa, if they were used. Wd. give a chance. 3) Anglo, Am. Commn with 3 tasks a) investign of J. posn in Europe. b) What relief by immigrn to Palestine c) What other reliefs - e.g. France, U.S. U.K. d) Consult Arabs &amp; Jews in confce first on immigr. second long-term policy. Rpt. to Govts. on interim action; to U.N.O. on long-term Alternative: Smuts to preside over B. &amp; U.S. repns. 3 main Commy. Possibly too, add Australian. Agreed: Palestine Cttee to consider quickly P.O. suggns made to-day. E.B. Wd like to tell Halifax on Sunday. So you can announce genl. intentns soon as H/C meets – as our genl. approach. To come to Cab. Friday p.m. if possible. H.M. H/C. wd. wait if you promised firmly statemt. in following week.
