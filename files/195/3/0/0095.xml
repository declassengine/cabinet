C.M.12(46). 6th February 1946. Greece. Proceedings in Security Council. E.B. Procdgs. at 5 Council. Stettinus and Chairman’s offer both wd. have met me. But procedure is awkward. V. motion was unacceptable to me : deferred (only 1 in favour). Then Eg. Del. motion : wh. included clearance for G.B. : Chairman asked views. U.S. China. Netherl. Poland. Egypt. France. Australia + G.B. favoured it.

Braz. and Mexico didn’t speak. V. then said he wd. use his veto – invoked rule of unanimity between Big Five. Wrangle followed on ques. wthr. this resoln. was procedure or substance. There is memo. of agreed interpretns. of rules – by wh. V. is right. Adjourned. Y’day Koo seekg. compromise. But either in endangering peace or not – see no scope for compromise. Last night Chairman was, I thought, to have read statement. Text read to Cab. That wd. have ended it. But, saying nothing to me, he passed it to V. who said he cdn’t accept it. Then, w’out reading document, he adjourned “for 5 mins” . He then showed me document, for 1st time. I said “if you intended to make statement why didn’t you make it”. Lie then asked me to go to his room. Reluctantly went, with A.C. Then found same posn. again. Pok had put in draft resoln. wh. I cdn’t accept. Stettinius produced resoln. wh. differed fr. his statement ¨everyone accepted and left me alone. This a.m. offered to w’draw : but m’while V. has telegraphed home on that basis. Read out draft prepd. by Stettinius for Chairman’s statement. Their idea is tht. you associate with this declns. of 9 nations tht. they regard our troops as endangering peace. I deferred my opinion pending infn. to Cab. This a.m. seen Chairman again – who says Evatt has told him not to use any formula wh. does not exonerate B. troops. Chairman qua. Australian will support inclusion of this reference. That is position up to date – thought I shd. take counsel with Cabinet. My own opinion – prefer no agreement rather than formula wh. doesn’t relieve me of imputations made. If they press Stettinius’ Chairman’s declaration, I shall make declaration. A. Meaning – first big issue presented has bn. burked, in spite of majority view. E.Sh. What does E.B. think effect will be of digging our toes in? E.B. Anglo- Soviet relations will be inadvertently affected. 494

A.L. V. knows he can’t carry his motions : will be annoyed with Council : needn’t affect our relationship. R.S.C. Soboliev was spkg. v. lightly about it this a.m. H.D. Encourage Makins to make his declaration.

E.Sh. We can’t w’draw from our posn.. But what wd. be effect in Greece of concls.F.B. Our prestige will be enhanced if Chairman makes the “Makins” decln. – because the case is dismissed – in Greece and throughout World. H.M. Anything less than Makins formula shdn’t be accepted. Wdn’t matter is declns. to contrary followed fr. one or two. Case wd. still be ours. Stettinius formula - evasion of responsibility. Unacceptable to us and bad for future of S. Council. F.B. Can’t veto a Chairman’s statement. P.M. Why shdn’t Chairman make a decln. adding tht. Council can’t pass a resoln. because Sov. exercised veto. A.B. We must insist on Chairman’s statement as next best thing to a resolution. A.B. And if he won’t E.B. shd. make a declaration. P.M. And see if Makin will omit final para. inviting those who disagree to say so. 495
