CM 46 (45) 26th October 1945 1. Parliament P.M. All members of Cabinet to vote at 9.45 Monday – first socialist vote, on Bank Bill. 2. Civil Aviation A. Party Group – 3 points a) Commonwealth Corpn. Not clear they knew how far this gone already – we have got as far as we can now: conference only last year: no use askg. Canada yet to reconsider. b) Internatl Confce. Wd. lead only to delay &amp; trouble. c)Private Capital. We thought tht. if any private capital to be allowed our method wd. be preferable to allowg. private cos. to run feeder lines, wh. might take cream off internal traffic. Real ques. = any private capital at all? Considered 3 times &amp; reluctantly convinced it is desirable, but draw attenn to safeguards, in para. 7 of memo. V. strict limits – may even frighten cos. away. Prestwick, Statement as on p.4. A.W. Para (c) Better stop at “airports”. Looks exclusive. i.e. as tho’ it excludes Atlantic. R.S.C. Or “and foreign countries” vice “and the Continent” P.M. “Overseas Countries” - Agreed H.M. Any provision excluding subsidies? A. That remains an open question. R.S.C. As private holding is now limited, it is so unattractive that it wd. be better to go for straight natn. No equity: no chance of capital accretions (because taking over at par). Go the whole hog &amp; save trouble with own Party. H.D. Agreed. Some talk with Party group – they say this is not the Party policy and they are reliable people. History = compromise with Swinton. If there are able men in railways &amp; shipping cos. let Minister bring them into nationalised service. Private money not justified on merits &amp; will cause diffies with reliable people in the Party. W. Thought my proposals best designed to get civil aviation started as quickly as possible. Much planning done along these lines. 297

A.B. In making concessions to Party views we are in danger of falling between 2 stools. Priv. enterprise w’out any of the merits of that. These will be inert shareholders in a State concern. E.Sh No ques. of principle – all agree natn is better method. Real ques. is, if we go for natn, what will it delay &amp; for how long. A.B. Alternatives: political decision or examn qua practical operation. Wd. have bn, better if pol. decision had come at beginning not now at end. Thought Cab. admitted last time princ. of admittg. private capital. Ques = machinery inc. facilities wh. shipping cos. can use for civil aviation. I thght. we cd. make better use of those if the cos. had a financial interest. P.M. What are these services wh. can’t be brought in unless cos. given share in management. Wd. there be delay in negotiating for use of these services w’out admittg. to shares. W. Cttee agreed surface cos. has services to render at outset. If they are to be excluded, I shd. have to examine where I cd. get these services or how long it wd. take to make them on State basis. R.S.C. Negotiations anyhow. And will they come in on these terms? W. Indicatns tht. they wd. be made to come in, even on minority holdings. E.Sh. They aren’t attracted by money considn but because of co-ordinn with shipping. E.B. I agreed to this scheme. a) Comonwlth. w’in one legal system. Stood out for natn in that sphere. But U.S. were for pr. enterprise everywhere. And in S. America you will be up against U.S. Cd. a State company, stand up to that. R.S.C. said then you can’t stop shipping cos operating there. All services in S. America in hands of shipping cos. Vast &amp; expensive duplicn to put in parallel services for State air service. Wd. be bad Press for natn. b) European. Gap left for internatl Europ. co. on public bases. But what wd. be cost of creating services throughout Europe – w’out r/ways &amp; Cooks. The overheads in this business are v. large. Aviation cdn’t carry this alone. My attitude – create an organisn wh. will come eventually into publ. hands when the rlways are natd. c) Had to carry legn repealing Act giving rights from Sweden to Balkans. Under Coalition this wd. have bn. difficult. No one wanted to buy them out. d) Developing quickly civil auth bldg. programme.

Need for speed. We are starved for air services. Crippling our foreign policy. Urgent need for these facilities in S. E. Europe. Understand this plan ndn’t. require legn. R.S.C. Yes: some will be needed. E.B. Not if you embody in this scheme the existing powers of cos. E.B. You cd. begin anyway. A State Co. cdn’t start until legn is thro’. The real point is cost of aviation co. carrying whole burden of tourist etc., services and the overheads. Alternative: State ownership with power to lease to cos. for operation Discussion adjourned. [Enter N. Edwards B. Smith] 3. Dockers Strike N.E. 500 more out. Mtgs. y’day. – no sign of acceptance of Union view. More mtgs. today &amp; tomorrow. But unlikely tht. strike will end during week-end. M/W.T. asking for 17 more ships to be unloaded. We have agreed, as it in ruling. P.Q. by W.S.C. – asked to defer until Monday in case strike collapses. E.B. Have suggested reply on lines, no interference with machinery, but clear tht. ships must be unloaded. N.E. Read draft answer. E.B. Don’t give the figures. Say Govt. is not going to intervene. Believe there is a vital or material change. I wd. say This matter is under attentn…… Further discn . E.B. &amp; NE w’drew to B.S. 15 food ships must go away at once or we will lose wheat. A.Barnes Two points in C.P. 248. H.D. Prefer mil. labour to dollar ships. B.S. Gap will come 6 wks. later because congestion in U.K. H.M. Can’t we give Ministers concerned authy to use mil. labour (after consultn with E.B.) w’out coming to Cab. on each occasion. E.B. Brought in draft answer to P.Q. Approved.

E.Sh. Pt. props. M/L won’t use mil. labour. H.D. Clear ruling tht. any Minister wanting mil. labour shd. have it. E.B. We shall have lots of indust. diffy. In Coalition Govt. we had small Cttee dealing with these ques. Suggest P.M. appoints a Cttee for Wages Policy &amp; Strikes so tht. M/L. can have advice. Suggest M/L alone to handle H/Commons. Barnes. O.K. So long as final decn is not with M/L alone. J.J.L. Want Cttee. Not easy to find the mil. labour. 17.000 now working &amp; 300 more being thrown in. Must survey to see what more can be provided. P.M. I will appoint a Cttee under H.D. [Exit Ness Edwards] 2. Civil Aviation (resumed) A. Cttee were influenced by the considns advanced by E.B. We were assured that Co. cd. provide the facilities needed, quickly, - that they wd. come in. You cd. go ahead w’out legn – tho’ you wd. need it later to exclude you needn’t exclude now because no aircraft. H.M. Must have quick decision because promised statement in H/Lords. a) Must have civil aviation aircraft quickly. b) C. Av. Group are good &amp; helpful. Wd. like to meet their views if we cd. – tho’ not so much a matter of princ. as they think. c) This shdn’t be run w’out regard to booking, etc., facilities. Each form of transport must play its part w’out prejudicing the other. Waste if each form carries own services for booking etc. Wdn’t it be better to own whole of the stock – no profit in it – but then appoint effective Cttee with air, r/ways, shipping. Barnes. They wdn’t come in on that basis. Remember we have to keep shipping cos. from tying up with American cos. Cdn’t W., Barnes, R.S.C. meet together &amp; discuss. R.S.C. Time for decision now. I wd. accept H.M.’s alternative. Imposs. posn for us: we have to argue v. natn because must have these people in. Then they will say “on our terms”. W. If you accepted Cttee’s recommn I cd. get agreemt. with them on essentials before statement in H/L on 1/11. H.D. Say on Thursday we have decided must be owned 100%: but go on to say we attach importce to agencies etc., &amp; are going to discuss with them 300

how they can co-operate. There is no money in it for them: but they are vitally concerned. T.W. You cdn’t get (or want) more control than this memo. offers. A.V.A. Mayn’t be much in the money. But psycholog. point = shipping cos. are frightened of losing their position : some interest will satisfy them. P.M. Let the stock be publicly owned. E.Sh. “Co-operation” isn’t enough. Cdn’t we also say “use as agents”. H.D. Shorter the statement, the better. Agreed: in form suggested by H.M. 4. Ceylon Constitution. A.G. Need for early statement. Movement for Dom. Status – too early &amp; in any case not before India &amp; Burma. We recommend therefore adoption of Southern Rpt plus decision tht. after 6 years we take initiative in further review. G.H. Two general elections in further 6 years. R.S.C. New inquiry will follow 2nd Genl. Election &amp; tht. wd. be issue at Election. Wd it not be better to fix the period at 5 years vice 6. A.V.A. I thought period shd. be longer. P.M. Diffy. of asking people to work interim constitn under fixed time period. Passage on this in Simon Rpt. on India. G.H. Para. 10 second par. of statement. P.M. This was said on Montague-Chelmsford proposals &amp; completely falsified in the event. A.G. There’ll be continuing agitation anyway. G.H. Ceylon has in mind promises to India &amp; Burma. Won’t such a promise this Constn won’t be accepted. P.M. And with it, it won’t be worked. Did you examine the practical experience in India? G.H. You can’t refuse to Ceylon the sort of thing you give to India. P.M. No reason to promise in 6 years.

Development - of constitutional practice: not by steps at stated period. Latter is contrary to all our experience. Suggest para. 10 be reconsidered, in light of Simon Rprt. &amp; practical experience in India &amp; elsewhere. Our objection is Dom. status, but can’t be achieved except by gradual practical evolution. Put if that way round. R.S.C. Para 10 can be made more attractive on these lines. As it stands first part is a slap in the face. Make is simply tht. this is first stage in progress twds. Dom. status. A.G., G.H., R.S.C. to meet with P.M. on re draft of para. 10. A.V.A. Bear in mind defence &amp; foreign policy. R.S.C. Last sentence of statement. Why include it at all? – if not bound by it. G.H. Not so easy. 1943 decln asked Ministers to work out constitn. Because they didn’t invite minorities we thght. shd. have 3/4 vote. Then after consultn Ministers w’drew their constitn. So we weren’t bound. Posn therefore is that we pay regard to majority view tho’ not bound by specific figure. But I don’t mind because Cab. is now asking me to do what I originally asked! G.H. to reconsider para. 12. P.L. Want to record views tht. India don’t like this Rpt. G.H. Ceylon &amp; India wd. have reached agreement, had it not bn for the war. There is real possibility of agreement. Approved: subject to points noted above on paras. 10 &amp; 12.
