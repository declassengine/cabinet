C.M. 64 (45) 20th December, 1945 1. Broadcasting Policy H.M. Daily b’cast of H/C. procdgs. P.M. By Pressman – not M.P. A. Must be impartial. J. A/c of Br. Woods debate in H/Lds. was ill reported.

P.M. y./ This is evce of need for strong Bd. H.M. x/. A. shd. send for responsible man in B.B.C. and talk to him about this reprtg. R.S.C. Unfortunate tht. Boothby shd. have done this Week in Parlt. They shd. have swapped him over. H.M. Can over this. Our list of Labour spkers. not v. good. The man for the v/Censure week wasn’t good: but awkward to shove him out. Risk of Parly. trouble. H.D. Why not general rule that man who took prom. part shdn’t do it.

E.Sh. Diff. to change at last minute. Real ques. is: B.B.C. shd. be truly impartial. When b’cast is made, people regard it as havg. Govt. blessing. We must see that our case is got across thro’ B.B.C. – especially now we can’t get it over in Press. Make it clear to B.B.C. that our case must be put over. P.L. The H/C. b’casts are in my view impartial &amp; v. good.

Agreed as at x/. And find out who there is editing B.B.C. as at y/. T.W. 10.15. p.m. is rather late. Para. 3(iii) of 344. Agreed A. Overseas costs not to be on votes of separate overseas Dpts. H.M. Will turn on ques. of Govt. Publ. Services. May go on Ty. Vote, on understandg. that separate Ministers defend policy.

P.M. Postpone decn. Much to be said for leaving this out G.P.O. vote. R.S.C. Point is – who will answer P.Q.’s

415

P.M. Postpone this issue. Para. 3 (iii) H.M. This is going well – France is co-operating well. N.B. Para. 51. Many ques. requiring interm. agreemt. Recommend early B. initiative on U.N.O.

Memo of P.M.G. approved.

Remuneration of Board. H.M. To official Cttee – and then to L.P. Cttee. P.L. Para. 32.: add Burma. Wise B’casting. 2 . Political Broadcasting. Ag. Agreed report.

Para 1. P.M. “Views of B.B.C.” On what? Text, time, or policy?

A.B. Mustn’t manipulate B.B.C. or you will undermine its authority, qua

independent.

R.S.C. Cd. they say “we don’t think this an appropit time for Govt. b’cast”. V. heavy weather there to invoke Cl. 4. P.M. If this means only consultn on techn. points, that shd. be made clear. H.M. On the other hand, they surely have a right to be consulted. They have a responsibility to the public. They must be reasonable, of course, but they surely shd. have an opportunity to express their views. P.M. Must not put B.B.C. in posn where they can A.B. ? “make the necessary arrangements with the B.B.C.” vice[] Agreed E.Sh. Is it the rule that Ministers shd. consult P.M. before b’casting”

P.M. Yes. 416

Para. 2.

Govrs. of B.B.C. are

P.M. What are the rights of the Opposition? Putting these things in black &amp; white is awkward. Want this done “thro’ usual channels”. not by someone in B.B.C. A.B. Suppose a Minister gives an objective statement and Opposn follow with outspoken reply. P.M. Put it in future – “where it is proposed…. B.B.C. shall discuss with 2 Parties whr opportunity shd. be given for reply.” H.M. Beware of totalitarianism. responsible people. Govt. shldn’t intervene.

H.M. You want both.

J.

E. Sh really is reserg. to Govt. right to judge in own cause. P.M. That’s not what I’m suggesting – I merely want this done thro’ usual channels to ensure that controversial ques. are identified by those competent to do so. R.S.C. All I want is to substitute “controversial” for “w’in the region of Party Politics”. B.B.C. shall enter into discns with repves of Parties to see whr there shd. be a reply. P.M. Yes: + puttg. into future. A.B. Don’t involve B.B.C. in “usual channels” Let appte Dept. be moved by B.B.C. to consult thro’ “usual channels”. H.M. Doesn’t this discussion show un-wisdom of precise agreement in writing. R.S.C. Yes – treat this as minutes of a mtg. not a concordat. Para. 3. Agreed. delete: covered by para. 2. Para. 4. Agreed delete: covered by para. 2. A.G. Para. 5. This is to cover case of ex-M.P. wishing to initiate. P.M. Do we propose to give right to Oppn to spk. weekly – with oblign on us to reply. R.S.C. “Any other Party” and tack it on to para. 2. P.M. This impinges on H/C. And throws Govt. on defensive. N.B. Series of pol. b’casts between elections” – once a month.

417

Add sentence to para. 2. – merely ensuring tht. Govt. are told if they

propose to accept.

P.M. Different issue. Para. 6. Can go, as consequential on omission of para. 5.

Para. 7. Agreed P.M. Para. 8. Goes too far. No objn to 2nd Rdg. on B.B.C. after 2nd Rdg. in H/C. P.M. This is otiose. R.S.C. It is sufficiently covered by 1 &amp; 2. N.B. Don’t agree with “notes”. Agreed: omit para. 8.

Para. 9 P.M. Don’t think this is right. H.M. I do. Otherwise B.B.C. is made instrument of pact between Parties. P.M. Leave this out.

1. contd. Broadcasting Policy. Licence Fee by instalments.

L. Assume 75%.

L. 500 extra staff and £1/4 addl. cost. Can get the staff by the time is needed. R.S.C. Do you assume everyone will take ½ yearly. [Exit C.E.] P.M. Don’t agree – more like 10%. Let us go ahead with £1 and see how we go on. A.S.C. Doubtful. H.M. White Paper in due course, before Charter received. [Exit. Listowil, Wms

[Enter: Hynd, Wilson, E.Wilk, Barnes, Smith, P.L., Creech Jones.] 3. German Prisoners of War. G.A.I. As in memo. If accepted, increase in allocn to Dpts will be possible. 430.000 total on this basis. Para. (3) – add S of S. for Air for he can help with accommn – possibly up to 12.000. H.D. Demobilisation shd. give even more room.

S. If we get our allocn of P.O.W. we can speed up demobn a. We can accommodate 30.000. J.J.L. This involves U/W.T, M/W., F.O. Big movement involved. Special Cttee seems to be needed. G.A.I. We have close contact at official level. There is a Cttee already. H.M.H. R. now satisfied with Monty’s arrangements for P.O.W. in Germany. Para. 7(2): 165.000 can now be assured minimum. B.S. In food trades B. workers won’t work with G. P.O.W. G.A.I. Consultn with Unions – can get over this. A. Canada House to be single channel. Agreed. N.B. a) Norwegian Govt. wants to be rid of these P.O.W. Don’t like guarding them. P.M. Tell them they must. N.B. b) G. p.o.w. in U.S. are v. Nazi. Want these screened. Agreed. J.B.H. Austrians shd. be repatriated.

3. Trusteeship – Territories now under Mandate.

P.M.. The black ones shdn’t. [Exit G.A.I. and Invitees for item 3.] C.J. As in memo,

419

A. We are disturbed. Austr. concerned with Nauru. Smuts re-action vs Tanganika. If this is put out at beginning R. will want to have a share. Smuts wdn’t wish that. Nor wd. we.

P.M. But mandate system prevented any

P.M. Prefer to discuss this with Dom. repres when they arrive. E.Sh. Commd to “trusteeship” system – I gather. But must consider econ. links with U.K. – not touched on in this memo. Cdn’t assent until I knew whr economic alignment wd. be. economic link.

A. I am not objectg. on merits – merely on tactics. Want opport. to negotiate

it first with Doms.

E.Sh Then is it clear tht. if diff. princ. applied to adjacent territories econom. integration will not be weakened.. Tang. is in economic bloc with Kenya. C.J. W. Paper or inter-terr. organns in E. Africa last week. Made it clear tht. this fits in with trusteeship plan. Further safeguardg. clause in trust. agreement. Better than old Mand. arrangemt. wh. was absolutely “open door”. N.B. Certainly there shd. be prior consultn with Doms. You can’t stop R. raising awkward pts. Right place to make descn is in the Assembly. C.J. Time factor – must get decln in time to avoid delaying apprut Trusteeship Council. P.M. No difficulty on merits: but must discuss first with Dom. repves. Discuss with Doms. repves and bring up again. 420
