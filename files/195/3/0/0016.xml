Fraser. Yes: but one: for B. people. M/I. We have one in prepn . Fraser. As the film with Leslie Howard. Need to be prompt: now is the time. Forde. Naval pageant in Albert Hall is doing much good. P.M. Followed by separate films for special, e.g. India’s part etc. x/ Let B.B. make a report to Cab. on this. Fraser. Film of London 2 yrs. ago made prolonged impression in Doms. Agreed: at x/. 3/4. Foreign Affairs. a) Poland. b) World Organisation. A.E. Poland. No answer. Press rpts. Suggest R. attempt to collect some more repve Poles &amp; present us with fait accompli. How long can P.M. &amp; F.D.R. await an answer. P.M. Condns in Poland mayn’t be as bad as we feared. A.E. Rpts. varied. Litaner’s good: but he is prejudiced.

Fr. on Tuesday: statement on Wed. when that out of way. They might not then press for a debate. P.M. Topics for debate? A.E. Voting procedure. Veto of Gt. Powers. Evatt. Veto extends beyond security ques. to any ques of amending the Charter. A.E. We argue tht. we aren’t bound by that. We are commd only to veto for use of force or sanctions. Veto not to be used to prevent discussions or applns by small Powers. P.M. All resources of public opinion will be open &amp; Gt. Power concerned, as well as small, will have neither veto nor note.

Political not judicial issues on Security Council. This is additional to all other safeguards. M.A.P. Agreed. After area of discn &amp; entry into area of action, the basis is political action not juridical. The issue = will we use military power to enforce our view. Evatt. No gt. diffce of view on this point. Only ques: we don’t agree that the Veto shd. extend to any amendments of the Charter. S/S Air. What of quarrel betwn 2 small Powers? Cannot force be invoked to support the majority view? A.E. We shd. argue veto shdn’t apply there. R. may say it should. P.M. Anyhow advantages of public discussion in mobilising world opinion against the wrongdoer. Evatt. Not the fact of the veto, but the extent of it: that worries us. P.M. Many voices will be raised at S. Francisco. Smuts. We’ve agreed to argue tht. the veto shd. be restricted to cases in wh. a great Power avows herself to be concerned. [ Enter M/W.T. 5. Situation in Holland. Smuts. Profoundly concerned. Since arrived, seen pp. &amp; people. Agree with mil. advice: no good to send Army. Forces rightly deflected elsewhere: &amp; fighting it out wd. cause a shambles in Holland. But we can’t do nothg. while this tragedy is consummated. What can we do? Can’t we agree with G. thro’ Swiss to get food in: for distribn thro’ Red X. If they decline they brand themselves as criminals before mankind. And we cd. declare tht. we wd. treat them as such. 21½ -3 m. in occupied Holland – they are literally dying. We must exhaust every means of avoiding it: &amp; if we can’t put the blame where it rests. Propose therefore: tell G. we are willing to send in food for distn thro’ Red X. If they decline, say you declare yourselves criminals &amp; we will treat you as such. P.M. Most troops mobile moved out? C.I.G.S. 2 mobile &amp; 1 static Divns. left.

P.M. Object of airborne opn ? C.I.G.S. To assist move twds Emden. But Canadian attack tonight is aimed w. into Holland: &amp; Monty has allocated 2 Divns. to clear the area &amp; take on their feeding. Bottleneck = crossings over Rhine: all wanted to support our movement eastwards thro’ Germany. Military relief beyond what is planned is bound to have repercussions on our eastward movement. S. Why not use barges vice bridges. P.J. We are using everythg for our eastwd. Movemt. C.I.G.S. Examd this a.m. Ike’s plans for relief. We appd in minute to you. P.J. 1 m. rations ready now for free dropping: preparing 2 m. more. Magnitude: stocks for 2 more = 130.000 t. v. big transport problem. P.M. Any reason v. askg. F.D.R. to join in notice to G. thro’ Protecting Power: time limit for answer: tht. respond. on them: as they haven’t discharged it we are prepd thro’ Red X by x/ such methods as are available supplies for civil populn . Invite their concurrence. A.E. Doing it now thro’ Swedes on a small scale, by ship. Ques. of extending same principle. P.M. Add threat tht. if they refuse we shall hold responsible with their lives all the G. troops now in Holland. Su. Let them first refuse. Do it in 2 stages. P.M. Then address the threat to G. in Holland not G. Govt. On basis – if y/ you resist entry of our Red X convoys. L. If G. agreed we cd. send it in by ship. C.N.S. 5 days to clear mines. P.M. As at x &amp; y. Publicity. Leaflets to G. occupying troops. Wavell. Intern. Red X will have to do the job. Are they ready? A.E. z/ Tell Prot. Power at once we are makg. the approach. (F.O.)

Favour evening – time to be discussed. P.J. a) Need to emphasise Jap war goes on. Fraser endorsed. P.M. promised to see King’s speech was consistent with that. b) Announcg. programme: effect on troops: dulling their keenness. C.I.G.S. Are (1) and (2) separate? H.O. Yes P.M. (2) cessn of hostilities: breakdown of organised resistance. L.P. In Germany only? C.f. Norway, Italy etc. J.A. Must be resistance by Germany: not in Germany. P.M. Decision must be taken on the facts at the time. M/L. Better if announcemt. cd. be made so tht. we had stand-by for statemt. by P.M. Otherwise they will all knock off when Sirens blow. Dangerous in some factories. H.O. Much to be said for ll. a.m. Fraser. End by “declaration” vice Armistice will involve decn by 3 States.
