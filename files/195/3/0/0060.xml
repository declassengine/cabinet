C.M. 39 (45) 9th October 1945 1. National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) BillA.G. Had bn. understood Bill agreed: that was why L/P said Bill wdn’t differ substantially fr. that introd. by Coalition Govt. Now, however, T.U.C. have put fwd. further proposals. Soc Ser. Cttee. y’day broadly in agreemt. with my memo. Tried to hold T.U. leaders to their word – w’out success. Some reason to believe 45/= wd be acceptable. That wd mean another 10 is coutce. Shd. fall on workman. Believe Allen wd. accept that addtn rather than lose the addl. benefit. Secondly “compositor’s finger” suggest 25% addn in nos. of loss of emplt. Diffices again partic because of repercussions on war pensions. P.M. Original proposals were accepted? J Agreed, tho’ the consultns were informal. Diffy. here is repercussions on rest of scheme. 103/6 = max. for married + 1 – as against 45% under qual. scheme. This = original scheme. Marks v. gt. Diffce between accident in and out of emplt. If this gap is even further widened as now proposed it will be diff. to avoid pressure for increases in qual. scheme. “Compositor’s eye” – gets twds. old princ. of wages – also hardship with examn in widw. cases. J.G. Cttee came to me as fr. Congress. In same week deputtn from miners. Various pts. But these were two major points. On the loss of 4 fingers on right hand = 40% incapacity only: this is much worse than existing system. Said tht. unless these 2 pts met they wd. oppose Bill strongly. On prev. “acceptance” they said accepted only as best they cd then get. A.G. Allen’s attitude since then has become more conciliatory. H.D. No complete pictures yet of advances in whole field of social improvement. Repercussions if we yield at first Bill to be presented. Not sure wtr. M.P.’s are takg. same line as T.U.C. members. Worried ab. pressure groups. Not so much concerned at para. 3(a). Para. 3(b) however, is a serious grievance – always was even under old Bill. Agreed strongly: workman are being asked to pay contns for first time &amp; you tak fr. them. their right to ask court to assess their real loss. This is the real diffy.: believe it wd. be easier to get 3(a) w’drawn if 3(b) is conceded than other way round. T.U.C. don’t seriously say they’d rather lose the Bill. 275

H.M. Reln with other scheme – I have always argued there is a case for differentiation. And we got that accepted. We have raised basic rate, to meet workers’ argument re single man, to 40%. But we build on that, right up to 103/6. M/L in this argument overlooks the other side – where disability incurred and no compensn awarded. My fear: competition bidding, T.U.C. &amp; miners &amp; miners M.P.’s. If we are going to make concessions, make them quick &amp; stand by them. R.S.C. Must take a/c of fact tht. Govt. has changed. Quite legit. for T.U.C. to ask us to go further than Coaln Govt. wd. have gone. Para 3(b) is more important than 3(a). Second = genl. Standards. First long-standing diffy. – loss of special skill. Reasonable (tho not strictly logical) case for special machinery for assessg. addl. payment for that. Don’t know addl. cost. A.G. Addl. 10 wd. cover both a) and b). R.S.C. What wd. b) cost? A.B. But this wd. introduce v. diff. principle – not easy to decide these issues. E.B. On b) we are going to spend millions on re training: &amp; that isn’t taken. into a/c. Cdn’t you meet it by inserting in b) addl. condn that he can’t by re-training fit himself to earn equivalent amount in alternative occupn. Danger of demoralising man by encouraging him to make no effort at alternative emplt. E.Sh This is v. important for miners. Silicosis cases: anxious re re-training. They shld. be re-trained. Favour high compensn, but not good tht. men disabled fr. followg. own occupn shd. be left in that static condn for life. J.G. Provn in Bill for re-training &amp; shd. use them to the full. Agree tht. words cd. be added as suggd by E.B. W.P. If 3(b) is accepted, we shall be pressed to give some concn to war pensioners. We’ve tried to avoid it in the past by re-training. E.B. Isn’t it possible to promise considn on these lines as Cttee point? J.G. They regard it as pt. of principle, &amp; will contend for it on 2nd Reading. Miners’ M.P.’s support T.U.C. view. P.M. Statement on principle cd. be made on 2nd Readg. R.S.C. As in ins. in margin of 3(b).

General agreement on 3(b) as amendment. H.D. Remember there will be irresistible pressure for same concession on war pensions. x/ That is a falling commitment, however. Is it necessary then to concede 3(a). Danger of its running into other schemes. G.A.I. Many workmen insure separately v. sickness: not, however, v. accident. Also they are paying for it, for 1st time. E.B. With re-training provn I believe 3(b) will cost v. little indeed. 198.000 reduced to 17.000 by re-training – hard core of unemployed at outset/war. Whole system of treatment is different now. G.B. a) Don’t like harking back to a relation to earnings. b) If Tribunal says unfit for training, then unanswerable case for 100% pension. A.V.A. On x/ peace-time pensions code wd. have to carry the same provision. Agreed: Para 3(a) and 3(b) as qualified. Enter: Tomlinson Wilmot Whiteley Marshall. 2. Housing A.B. 1) White Paper on position as we found it. 2) Blue Paper on facts wieldg. statistics. Housing = largely adminve &amp; dependent on l.a.’s. Want to reverse balance in favour of l.a. bldg. of houses to let. Subsidy rates get agreed with Ty. But want to make it clear tht. whole success depends on reducg. costs. Strong campaign for relaxg. controls, - to let private enterprise in. That wd. produce chaos &amp; inflated costs. Licensing 1200 (1300 in Ldn.). To supplement l.a. bldg. Will restrict Powers if l.a. amends it. But need for it in order to use labour tht. wdn’t get in to the l.a. programme. Bldg. industry demoralised – employers &amp; workers. Stiffening up needed. Larger output essential. Ldn. repairs lamentable. Other forms of bldg. not cheaper, quicker or better: but they economise in scarce bldg. skills. Recommendg. them for consn of l.a.’s. Can we find an alternative form wh. we cd. impose on l.a.’s? Not yet. A steel house mock-up ready: &amp; we’ve said we’ll take 25.000 pairs. Won’t get delivery until beginning ’47. Wd. be useful supplement to us &amp; run-on might be exported. System of standardised house constn is essential as discipline or whip for bldg. industry.

277

Am apptg workg. team under Bernal to see whr we can select fr. various systems one which we cd. recommend to l.a.’s as “building”. Land acquisition. Diffics in ’44. Housg. Cttee satisfied no way of expediting by modifn of existg. Statute. “Referencing” in any form will take too long. Recommend therefore applying the ’44 Act passed for tempy houses. Will be stoutly resisted. Conversion: Don’t want to use powers at once because extravagant in labour. But want the powers for use later. Restriction covenants wh. prevent conversion into flats.: enquiries procdg. To devise means of enabling leaseholder to set aside the restriction covenants in such cases. Under-occupied houses. Report D.R. enabling l.a. to acquire such houses. Hope is to keep that as a reserve power. Will start on basis of an appeal with little emphasis on the compulsory powers. L.a.’s will be authd to make the small alterations reqd: but don’t expect tht. much such work will be done. Purchase of houses for conversion to offices. Propose D.R. requiring consent in such cases of housing authy. No delay in authorising tenders. 60.000 already authd. Diffs.: L.a. haven’t staffs to go to tender. Appeal again for help of Service Ministers. 600 techn. Staffs of l.a.’s still not released. Only 9.250 houses now bldg. We cd. have made that 20.000 if those staffs released. P.M. What action taken on my Directive? J.J.L. I’ve given instrns on this. And heard of no diffs. A.V.A. Said the same. P.M. Any specific instances of failure to release? A.B. Will Service Ministers follow up these cases? P.M. M/H. shd. do that. A.B. We do it at official level weekly. H.M. Cdn’t Serv. Ministers ask for fortnightly report to them personally. G.B. We can’t get dif. answers, even negative: it’s nothg. we can get hold of. P.M. Delay is as bad as a refusal. Shd. be taken up at higher level. J.J.L. If lists are available, I will look into it . E.B. Cdn’t N.B. co-ordinate thro. Man Power machinery. 278

P.M. Health Ministers shd. take up unsatisf. cases &amp; report to me if he can’t get satisfn. Let me have a report: how many cases outstanding, how long, and why. A.B. Finally: Furnished Lets. Tribunals in areas where necessary. Legn necessary. P.M. Statement in House. Genl. picture showg. intentns. Some actions under D.R. Are these ready? A.B Yes. P.M. And legn? A.B. Subsidy not yet. Simplified procedure for acquisition is in hand. P.M. Make sure you indicate how these powers will be taken &amp; be sure you can fit them in to leg. p’mme. A.G. Diff. is get these in. A.B. Suggd put them into one Bill. But misc. provns Bills not popular. G.B. In Scotland, progress not unsatisf. if we cd. only solve labour shortage. Even in S. Scottish ind. belt, hopeful signs of progress save for labour shortage. H.M. This statement will be bound to provoke demand for debate prob. 2 days. Wd. have bn. better to take them on a Bill: &amp; save Parly time. Para. 2. These figures are same as coalition Govt.’s. were criticised. Awkward to produce them. A.B. Not going to. H.M. V. well. Many negatives in this memo. V. serious pol. diffy. in refusg. to include houses for sale. No need to begin war v. bldg. societies. Tempry houses to be stopped. Collection of odds &amp; ends. Nothg. distinctive about this. Much quality w’out detail – eg. Manuf. of components. Case for W. Paper on tempry houses. But don’t want the proposed Blue Paper. Wd. rather have this tidied up into distinctive policy. And wd. prefer to debate it on a Bill rather than up in the air. A.B. But the Bill wd. restrict the discns. H.M. Not if it were a reasonable wide Debate. E.Sh. On subsidy Bill you cd. have a wide debate.

279

T.W. Complete exclusion of rural housing will also raise a storm. In any genl. debate there must be special reference to that Reliance on l.a’s will produce v. few houses in rural areas. Para. 5: no 100 Labour Members representg. agr. (or rural) constituencies. Storm will come therefore not only from opposition. A.B. Of course I sh. include a reference to rural housing. But we haven’t yet had enough data on wh. is base subsidy. T.W. Neither M/H. nor Ty. has consulted M/Ag. Yet re rural housg. More cosultn on there specl. problems before a genl. statement made in I.D.C. P.M. Discussed by Housg. Cttee? A.B. This brings together many ques discussed on that Cttee. A. Supported H.M’s obsus. – shd. be more positive related to lgn. [Exit R.S.C. &amp; P.L.] a) Rural housing. P.O.W. will be reportd. b) Believe M/W. and M/S. shd. build. Default powers won’t do. Prefer direct bldg. by Dpts. I refer particularly to rural area. Won’t get harvest year after next unless this is done. A.B. All these suggst have bn. considered. Effect on l.a. bldg. of establsd Housg. Commn. P.M. We must adjourn this discn &amp; bring up again. Some of these pts. shd. have bn. discussed before Cab. Stage. E.g. rural housing. Don’t rush into debate without a better policy than this. E.B. a) Co-op Bldg/Socies will considg. Housg. Commns in some regions – complain at not being consulted. They have a good contn to make. b) Don’t want Housg. Commsn. But want M/W to be empowered to build; &amp; don’t see how you will drive prices down otherwise. Example Supply Dept. costing durg. war enforced by Dpt. experience. c) London. Repairing 100 yr. old houses, when vacant sites are adjacent. Wd. it not be more economical to build new houses on those sites, wh. are ready serviced. A.B. Said at outset this was largely an adminve problem. That is why any statement must look patchy. Co-opv Societies. Can’t add to nos. of houses by new money, so long as bottleneck is labour and materials 280

P.M. What of bottlenecks a) lack of l.a. techn. staffs. b) inefficiency of l.a. in rural areas. P.M. But further considn needed, in general, by Housg. Cttee. A.G. List of Bills required – because Legislation Programme. P.M. And preciser the issues, &amp; clear as many Ministerial disagreements as possible. Exit: Invitees for item 2 Enter Noel Baker. 3. Syria and the Lebanon E.B. Asked approval for Annex A. Ask for no commitment to Annex B. J.J.L. W.O agree to that. But if any unilateral w’drawal by us while our troops remain there will be trouble. Thus ask no w’drawal by B. save simultan. with Fr. E.B. We went for war purposes. We have no right to stay there. I’ve taken that line with R. on w’drawal fr. Iran. AVA. Agree with that. But have you considered how it will go in confce Fr. will keep Beirut. And Fr. will be able to block anythg. in Security Council. E.B. Let that be an issue between Fr &amp; Syrians. Not an issue involvg. G.B. My offer to w’draw must be clear &amp; unconditional. J.J.L. Can we find accommn between the 2 if we go &amp; Fr. remain. E.B. Not so much diffy. in Lebanon. They may agree to Fr. &amp; B. troops remaining From Syria both Fr. &amp; ourselves must go. J.J.L. If there is trouble then, we are in command. Remember that. [Exit N. Baker]. 4. Dock Strike G.A.I. a) 6 perishable food ships in Lpl. approve with Labour. b) Can I offer immediate Cttee of enquiry into condns in the docks. On a) 2 contain bacon, &amp; immed. cut in rations will follow. G.B. Trouble? dispersal of concentn of ships in Lpl. has led to drop in wages. On a) wdn’t hesitate if I was M/L. for food ships. But response shd. not be shared as Cab. decision.
