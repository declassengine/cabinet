C.M. 48 (45) 1st November, 1945 1. U.S. Bases in Iceland E.B. U.S. gone ahead in spite of our views. Iceland Govt. pressed for expn of our views. We have taken line in para. 3, But diffies if R. make counter-claim re Bornholm or Spitzbergen. Hence prefer para. 4. P.M. Better to stick to line that all these matters must wait for U.N.O. A.V.A. Is there anything in Art. 43 to prevent bi-lateral arrangements. Also don’t exclude our own bi-lat arrangements with Doms. E.B. Agree bilateral not excluded. But unwise to do it now, when U.N.O. coming in. Agree don’t want to submit our agreements (existing) with e.g. Iraq. R.S.C. Bias in favour of doing all these things thro’ U.N.O. A.B. Inconsistency between this attitude &amp; para. 3. That para. condones U.S. action. E.B. Remember U.S. forces are there: reasonable for them to ask: but assume eventual U.N.O. arrangement where they are members of U.N.O. Agreed: as in para. 4. [Exit Cadogan Enter Collick] 2. Billeting of German Prisoners on Farms. Collick M/Ag. agree with this proposal. C.E. H.O. intd qua public order. G. shdn’t be given status of collaborators, &amp; Police shd. be consulted in advance. G.I. Agree: same security arrangements. Agreed Exit Collick] 3. Civil Defence: Future Organisation C.E. L.T. agrees. H.D. Avoid premature commitment to organisation involving expenditure. Agreed. [Enter G.T.]

4. Victory Celebrations C.E. Regard premature reports in Press. E.Sh. Loss of coal etc., from V. Days. Does this mean loss of another working day? Any need for further celebrations? P.M. May be next summer: not this winter. A.B. Why not wait for Peace Treaty? H.M. We haven’t had procession thro’ London of Forces. Have it on a Sunday, if you like. A. Affects Doms. Wd. like to be associated with official cttees. G.H. Ditto. for Colonies. Want out troops in the parade. S. Repn of Allied Forces. G.T. M/W shd. be represented. General View: Not before the spring. Agreed: P.M. to appoint Cttee. 5. Newfoundland A. Outlined proposals in memo. (i) cf para. 3 of statement: expert to go out first, for much depends on their solvency. Their present surpluses are due to war circs. Full facts must be put before the Convention. Hope Ty. reprve will go out too. Movement twds. Canada. N. realising they are less well off than C. maritime provinces. M. King wd. be favourable: but no sugn of this shd. come fr. Canada or U.K. This + another reason for getting facts before the Convention. Statement in Parl. Can’t avoid length – need to trace the history. Candidates to be reqd to reside in constituency. Special need to avoid carpet. baggers. P.M. Merchants running the island – their interest to avoid Canadian connection. Wonder wtr geograph. basis is best for constituencies. Fear the merchants will still control it. Wd. it be possible to compose it by repres of industries, workers etc., - an entirely unorthodox Soviet method. Repn by occupation. A.B. Party trouble. Not for Imperial Parlt. alone. Cd. the report be considered by a Dom. Conference. All Doms. concerned under St. of Westminster on a ques. of Dom. losing its status. 309

H.D. What we want to work for is union with Canada. Do nothing to delay that. From Ty. angle that is most desirable. £17m. sterling debt: wd. hope to get Canada to take that over. E.Sh. First ques. a) resuscitating self Govt. in N. Second b) absorption into Canada. Get on with a). But b) raises wider issues. S. Africa e.g. wanted to annex territory &amp; we resisted it. We shd. have more diffy. with S.A. if we let Canada absorb N. Shd. also look at this qua economic expansion. What will happen to Canada – U.S. economic penetration. Also U.K. capitalists seeking openings for exploitn in Canada. From last Parl. Commn, not sure we cdn’t develop N. economically on independent basis. For these reasons reserve my opinion on b). A. Cd. be no ques. of annexation.. Cd. happen only on N’s request. On economic independence – v. little prospect as things are. Canada’s Provincial Finances are being so re-arranged tht. maritime provinces wd. have some surplus wh. wd. bring advantages to N. On a) will re-consider basis for Convention – on lines of P.M.’s suggestion. E.B. Try a mixture between geograph. and industrial repn. A. Will consider A.B.’s suggn re Imperial consn – tho’ unlikely tht. other Doms. wd. wish to come in on ques. specially affecting one (i.e. Canada). J.J.L. Counselled caution re merger with Canada. Labrador wd. have to come in to the bargain. P.M. That is all a long way off. H.M. On Parly statement : always provokes demand for debate. This is much too long. A. Will try to shorten. P.M. And bring it up again. Agreed: General approval of policy: consider suggns made &amp; shorten statement: bring up again. 6. Labour Controls H.M. First ques.: have Labour controls a part to play in economic plan for transition. {Warning re bldg. Unemplt. of bldg. labour for lack of materials etc. in ‘46 { Risk of breach of faith with bldg. Unions.

That = only one example of diffies arising all round. Cd. explain to public tht. all will suffer if labour is not distributed acc. to national need. We have conducted much publicity on economic controls generally, but none on labour controls. General attitude – assumes time for freedom has arrived. M/L. feel unable to enforce, by prosecution. T.U.C. has pressed for relaxation. Face the position that other controls can’t alone secure priorities. First ques. therefore is can alternative (vi) run for 6-9 months. If (v) is rejected, Cabinet shd. consider wtr refinements in (iii), (iv) can be added to (ii). Objn : singling out invidiously part. industries. Believe therefore real choice is between (v) and (ii). P.M. First consider whether (v) is politically practicable. G.I. Don’t believe it is. T.U.C. pressure came after mtg. of Joint Consult. Cttee – i.e. employers as well as T.U.C. favour relaxation of this control. Direction for war into better pay is different from dirn for peace into worse pay. Can’t persecute men over 30 coming out of Forces. Can’t really ask for impt. If we stuck to age 30 – military age – we cd. defend a strict enforcement. Easy to avoid control – med. cert.; or slacking &amp; getting sacked; advertisements (not for men between 18-50!). We can’t enforce. People who wdn’t obey dirns to cotton are now volunteering to go back when condns have improved. Let us rather take over the difficult industries. E.Sh. Altern. (v) can’t be considered alone. Recalled para 2(i) of memo. If v. large nos. returning from Forces, a sufft. propn. wd go back to unpopular industries. Now, with only a trickle, there is greater reluctance to go back: men are more “choosey” Meanwhile , we can’t rely on that. Urge therefore wait until we can see x/ what attitude is adopted when the large nos. begin. M/L case = can’t enforce the existing controls. Answer; not as rigidly as during the war. Even then not 100% enforcement, but you still carried on. Urge therefore alternative (i). Mining. Wastage gross 74.000 p.a. rate – in a recent week 1,800 left and 800 came in. Can’t go on like that. Some control must be kept. Suppose you lift control at age 30, miners will take advantage of that so long as other jobs are open. Recommend therefore as at x/ i.e. alternative (i). J.J.L. Favour alternative (v). You cdn’t do (ii) &amp; retain control over bldg, agric. &amp; mining. You wd. tie those workers to particular jobs, often with grt. hardship. 311

Para. 2(i). Challenged last phrase. My evidence is to contrary. In Oct. 140.000 passed – 150.000 expected to be reached – i.e. up to plan. In last 11 days 73.000 came out. P.M. Leave that aside: for 2(i) really means somethg. greater even than planned. R.S.C. Quite impracticable to adopt (v). Agreed: (v) is impracticable. A.B. But situation then is v. serious w’out a real spate of demobilisation. J.W. While agreeing full enforcemt. impracticable, don’t think I can achieve my production commitments with labour shortage as now. Big public campaign shd therefore be started to get people to understand needs. Raise standards in bad industries. Prevent luxury trades fr. enticing labour from key industries. Explain need for labour controls. Then enforce them. Argue therefore for keeping controls in being &amp; wait till you can enforce them. B.S. Answer = a proper wages policy. Direction to lowest paid industry won’t work. A.B. Urge: keep controls in being until you can enforce them. Large nos. do accept direction. Don’t do anything to undermine their sense of discipline. If you aren’t going to distribute man power plan, you can’t allow wages to determine the distribution so long as wage rates are independently fixed. During war wages in mining didn’t keep step with wages in R.O.F.’s P.M. You wd. have also to keep wages down in luxury trades. H.D. Have promised to peg c/living a year. I cdn’t agree to “wages policy” involving immediate increases. Anti-inflation measures wd. be defeated. Diff. to depress wages in luxury trades. Need for greater caution in providing incentives thro’ wages in next 12 months. Consider this as short-term problem. Hold on to substance of controls – bother the law – keep anything that helps. Favour something between (i) and (v). G.A.I. Not whole field under review. ? subject to E.W.O. Even if we decide to defer decision, that shd. be clearly announced. G.B. Let not H.D. press his point too far. In bldg. real shortage = labour. And need is for higher rate for him. Talking of subsidies for rent &amp;

housing units apply to craftsmen &amp; labourers alike. Need for adjustment of unskilled rates. Favour (i) – tho’ not optimistic: sometimes think it ineffective. R.S.C. Distinguish short. term &amp; long-term problems. A.V.A. Favour (i) – but because employers want to return to “freedom to discipline” the workers. Supply Ministers want to keep E.W. Orders on, to prevent industrial trouble. R.S.C. Short-term = man up essential industries. Long-term = how to match our economic plan. Not ready yet with solution of long-term. The short-term must be empirical. Need to get early solution of long-term problem before people all think there will be complete freedom. Believe a wages policy will be necessary - in acc. with national priorities. E.B. a) State regulations of wages – a national minimum &amp; you face mass action to change them. All sections of workers v. Govt at once. That is why we have h’to retained industrial machinery for wage fixation. Otherwise, you face a General Strike. b) What are the luxury industries with high wages? R.S.C. Luxury clothing as against utility. E.B. But the nos. in bespoke trade are negligible. c) While general wage. fixing wd. be mistake, there is need for expediting the working of the industrial wages machinery. d)Were mining wages slow in relation to R.O.F.’s? E.Sh. Admit it’s now one of best paid industries. But it isn’t attractive. E.B. Remember every time we raised the wages the output fell. e) Building. Piece-work reduced Macalpines cost by 20%. Output of bricks 280 p.d. average., on return fr. employers: and on factories it rose to 1.000 p.d. when piece-work was introduced, on system of bonus after 480 p.d. Had hoped paymnt. by results cd. be applied to housing on straight bldg. Diffy: repairs – I wd. have tried for a higher rate for “technical” work as in engineering. Believe you cd. build after dark by artificial light. [Exit: E.W.] On c) Wages Council Bill – machinery too slow. Urge Govt. to be v. careful re wages policy. Suggd Cttee on this because M/L. can help industry by giving guidance in advance. on wages

movements. Let them know how far they can go. W’out Cttee you have to brk. off &amp; go to Ty. – then delay. Controls – what about the employer. Dirn to work for a man’s profit is too difficult. What do we regard as State emergency work. Define that. Announce it. Then publicity for it. In war there was power to force employer to accept a worker &amp; to keep a novice in for 6 wks. before sacking him. What is longest length of run? M/S tells me 3 months. You can’t get men to settle down for such a period. What you want is through runs for 18-24 months. No controls will fill that need. On foundries etc, let us put the amenities in. Reduce the minimum no. prescribed by the Order. Need is for vigorous adminn. Don’t announce yet any decn to relax. Build up the positive side, until you can enforce the compulsion. Don’t favour division at 30: will cause trouble. Don’t believe you can distinguish between trades, as in (iii) and (iv). Lodging allowce might be re-considered, to improve mobility.

P.M. General view: no change at present. L.P. Cttee to consider suggns made in discussion. 7. Parliament. Debate on Foreign Affairs H.M. Deal with W.S.C. as between P.M., E.B. &amp; W.W. w’out reference to me as Leader. P.M. Didn’t know Leader hadn’t been consulted. W.S.C. pressed for 2 days. H.M. How do we announce it? W.S.C. suggests confirm Debate to Truman’s 12 points. I wanted H/C. to know this was W.S.C.’s suggn but ask that this be observed. Whip’s Office prefer a form which doesn’t mention W.S.C. A.B. Those points are so wide that Speaker cdn’t rule anything out. P.M. Cd. only be an appeal to H/C General View: mention wishes of W.S.C. This means postponing Parly. Procedures for a week. H.D. Don’t want any discussions in H/C. re Washington talks.
