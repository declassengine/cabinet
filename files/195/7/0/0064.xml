C.M. 71 (49)					12th December, 1949



1.	    Cruelty to Children.



C.E.	Motion for debate in H/C.

	Was ready to accept it because think enquiry only practicable method of approach.

		But my 2 colleagues concerned don’t agree.

	More diff. that Curtis Cttee problem.  For these children are living with its parents.  Now care of N.S.P.C.C. – public confidence, tho’ organn open to criticism.  Cttee of offls. wdn’t get those criticisms across to public.

	Remedial measures.  For feckless women.  Offls. quite unsuited to advise on this.  No confidence in there recommns.

	Agitators shd. be faced with respons. for constructive suggns Dpl. Cttee wd. face them up to that – in evce given publicly.

	Advocate Cttee like Curtis Cttee.



H.M.	Include some M.P.’s.



P.M.	Investign:  improve N.S.P.C.C.  Remedies.  But preventn?  How can Cttee deal with that?



C.E.	Penalties.  Impt of mother &amp; return of children thereafter solves nil.

		Salv. Army home in Plymouth – residence on condn of probn.  Very promising, but courts won’t use it.  Cttee might ventilate.

	After-care of mother needs thought.  N.S.P.C.C. rely on men insprs.

		Women wd. be more suitable.



A.B.	a) Reluctant to associate M/H with Cttee.

	My Offls. not keen on Curtis Cttee – sensational &amp; bad report.  Resulted in v. expensive machine wh. won’t improve treatment given.  Risk of being stampeded into further expense.

	Problem:  decide what neglects warrants penal action.

	Sensational evidence – sentimentality etc.

	b) Adminve changes in N.S.P.C.C. cd. be secured by private approach.

	c) H.O. have agreed to enquiry into accommn for homeless families in Gtr. Ldn.  Instances of evictions of feckless parents – wd. you on that a/c separate children fr. parents?  Ultimate remedy will be to force l.a.’s to give them house even if they won’t pay rent.

	d) Plethora of Cttees, w. parties etc.  Sign of weak Govt.  Victims of our own machinery.

	e) Why can’t offls. deal with this.  They are fathers, husbands, wives etc.

	f) Undefined field.  T. of r. will be v. diff.  Roving enquiry – limelighted by Press.



G.T.	Debated in H/C. in July.  In response we set up w. party of officials.

		Their enquiry is going on.  Why not wait for their report.

	V. wide field.  Must keep open here work of vol. organisations.

C.E.	Agree with that.

	But we shan’t vote down this Motion.



P.M.	Any evce of increased cruelty to children?



C.E.	No:  but neglect has bn. dodged in past – and there’s a lot of that.



A.W.	This is partly political.  Pre-disposed r. enquiry.  But if politically necessary, we shall have to have one too.

		But delicate field to enter upon.  Private homes – relns of mother/child.

		40% of known cases brght. to notice by p.a. authies, rest by l.e.a.’s.

		Provides adequate supervision.



H.M.	Magnitude of problem often exaggerated.

	But whenever case occurs there is surge of popular feeling.

	Awkward if we resist this &amp; then there’s a case to-morrow.

	Curtins Cttee.  Then much exaggeration.  But L.C.C. home:  Newport: one in the north.  Political pressure cdn’t be resisted.  Enquiry did show tht. there was somethg. to be remedied.  M/H. and M/E. didn’t want that.  Enquiry was private:  cd. be so again.  We cd. rule so:  &amp; decline to publish evidence.

	Shall be in pol. diffy. in resistg. enquiry.

	Composn of Cttee will need careful thought.



C.E.	Has bn. unoffl. enquiry by Mrs Hubback.  They got complaints.  Another enquiry cd. answer some of these.

	V. diff. to settle a) scope b) kind of remedial measures.  Want to put sponsors up r. that diffy.



A.B.	Cd. we promise to consider this when offl. w. party has “defined the

                  x/	field.”?



A.	Try to get out of it on this basis.



P.M.	Danger of protest at interference with private liberties.



G.A.I.	Cd. we not get informn about scope of the evil?  Summary courts cd. give it, surely.



A.B.	Much of this neglect can be shown to arise out of over-crowding/under-housing or slum condns.  Won’t  help A.W. to have that brought out.

		Or me, much.  With cuts in housing p’mme.



P.M.	Agree to x/.  But is he to promise to have a cttee then?  Or merely that he will then consider Cttee?



H.M.	We shan’t get away with the second.

A.W.	Diffies of remedial measures.  Offls. are more reliable on that than outsiders.  Don’t commit us to Cttee.



G.T.	Don’t get committed.  See w. party report first.



P.M.	V. dangerous – individual’s feelings now, not condns – will get led on into v. dangerous country.



A.B.	Under provision of m.d. instns &amp; t.b. hospitals will be brought out.

		Why invite this sort of criticism?



N.B.	Cttee wdn’t report for a year – worst might be over by then.



			Agreed:  Say you will consider wtr. &amp; what sort of Cttee cd. 

			               usefully be appointed when w. party has defined

			               the field.

			               Accept Motion, having thus defined it.





2.	    Canada:  Trade Relations.



R.S.C.	Embarrassing speech by Gardiner.  Greatly resent this attack on officials.

		Esp. after recent exchange with Sr. Laurent.



			Agreed:  P.M. to send message to Sr. Laurent.





3.	    Australia:  Abolition of Petrol Rationing.



R.S.C.	[Fadden said he hoped this U.K. Govt. wd. be next to go.]

	Menzies has promised to abandon petrol rationing.

		V. serious implicns.  Ask them not to act before consultg. us.



N.B.	Pity he made this big plank in his election p’mme.



C.J.	Just about to renew legn in Malaya etc.,  V. awkward for us.



			Agreed:  High Commr. to be given message which can be 

			               delivered as soon as new Govt. takes office.

			               In a form in which it cd. if necessary be publd.





4.	    Film Industry.



H.W.	Debate Wed.   Colourless Motion.  Pressure for debate, esp. since Rank b/sheet.  Tho’ no new policy proposals, debate wd. be useful.  Will take place on same day as H/L. debate on grd. nuts.

	Rank has contributed all his troubles to entertainment tax.  Must hit back on that.

	After debate will submit memo. to Cab. on long-term policy.

		Promised to do so when Plant Rpt. received.

	In debate shall given a/c of 41/2 years of films;  and turn attack on Rank personally.  R.’s a/c shows 11/2 m loss on prodn in last year:  cdn’t have lost so much in a single year:  it’s clear tht. a/c. were cooked a year ago.

		R. is a Christian surrounded by crooks.  V. inefficient &amp; over-centralised organisation.

	Month ago I set up enquiry under Companies Act into Rank balance sheet.  Results won’t be ready in time for debate.  Shall announce that enquiry in genl. terms, not r. Rank.

		[It is apparently enquiry into correct method of valuing films.]

	Nat. Film Finance Corpn:  shall say it’s saved B. film industry from collapse.  50 films.  And over 50% of B. films being shown at any one time.

	Plant Rpt.  Complicated &amp; technical.  Recommend redn of power of circuits. + introdn of auction system.  I may have somethg. more radical to suggest.

	Plant was r. divorce of prodn &amp; distribn.  Rank owns 2/3rds of studios &amp; cinemas.  He must now get max. return fr. cinemas &amp; press for more U.S. films.  My advisers say Rank shd. get rid of one circuit (Ganmont British), &amp; tht. we shd. lease it from him for managemt. by an independent company.



A.B.	Welsh workers have run cinemas for 20 yrs. or more [ &amp; C.E.A. members make too much profit.]

	No case whatever for subsidising this industry.

		It must learn to sell, or change, its product.
