C.M. 14(50).				23rd March, 1950.





	1.	Parliament.                                           [Enter  W.W. &amp; Wheatley.



H.M.	Business for next week.

	28/3. F. Affairs debate.  E.B. &amp; M/State.

	Seretse:  Tories haven’t given Liberals a day (Supply).  I shall

		continue to say I haven’t time to give.

	30/3.  Business may be interrupted at 7. p.m.  For alteration of

		St. Orders which is debateable &amp; may be opposed.

		M/H. and Ty.

	Budget 18/4.

	Easter Recess 6–18/4.  Trying for longer recess at Whitsun.



	Will discuss with Opposn special days for debates.  Hope to avoid

		Private Members’ time.  If we have to give it – 5 days for

		Motions.  





2.	Mr Macmanaway.  Elected for W. Belfast, Clergyman of 

	C/Ireland. 

		Hasn’t appeared yet – funking Bing’s challenge.

		Sir Hugh O’Neill wants us to appoint Sel. Cttee.  Shd. we take

		this initiative?  If we don’t, &amp; wait until he appears, he will

		have incurred penalty – we might then have to bring in

		Indemnity Bill.  L.O.’s are doubtful wtr. he is disqualified.



P.M.	Att. Genl. thinks legal diffy. is too great for Select Cttee.

	Cd. Judicial Cttee of Privy Council take it – on reference from

		Sel. Cttee.



Wheatley.	Endorse Att. Genl.’s view.

	Precedent:  Sir Stuart Samuel 1912.  Sel. Cttee cdn’t pronounce on law:

		reported to House, who invited refce to Judicial Cttee for legal

		opinion.



J.	A convenient course.  But H/C. shd. find the facts &amp; refer to Jud. Cttee.

		It must be quite clear that they wish the reference.



A.B.	The refce must be sought by the House, thro’ Sel. Cttee.



P.M.	Let Govt. propose apptmt of Sel. Cttee.   Don’t leave that to Opposn.



C.E.	Yes:  we shd. keep initiative.





	3.	U.N.E.S.C.O. Delegation.



G.T.	Hardman has led U.K. delegn for 3 or 4 yrs.

		I suggd tht. this time an interested Tory might do this.

		F.O. think it dangerous precedent.



P.M.	Politically dangerous too.



E.B.	If we start bringing Opposn in, we shall be in diffies over other U.N.

		business.

	Send a Peer.



G.T.	Prefer to nominate Hardman &amp; let him go only after Easter ‘recess.





	4.	Transport Charges.	[Enter  B. &amp; Gaitskell.



P.M.	Summarised discns with M/T. etc.  Arguments both sides.

	My view:  can’t refuse increased charges.  But M/T. shd. submit full

		report on future of rlways., in assocn with Gaitskell.



R.S.C.	Condn of our agreemt. tht. B.T.C. wd. fully co-operate.



B.	Don’t imply tht. there has bn. failure to co-operate.



E.B.	B.T.C. have bn. unfairly treated.  W’in 12-18 months, can you expect

		one branch alone to stand these extra costs.  Ty. pinched their

		war-time profits.  Much loss due to our cuts of capital

		investment.  Why can’t a 3 yr. plan be worked out wh. makes

		this increase necessary.  Heavy tax on consumer – effects on

		coal etc.

	We set up B.T.C.  I won’t say to them tht., having tied their hands,

		we expect them to be efficient.  Their £20 m. loss is due to our

		own action.  This method will bring us down.



R.S.C.	What alternative?



E.B.	They shd. have kept their war-time profits.



B.	£43½ m. p.a. rent during war.  Abnormally large rail traffic.

		And no need to increase charges to reflect their rising costs.

		Excess profit:  £190 m. went into Exchequer.

	After war, Ty. met part of deficit &amp; rest came fr. increased charges.

		But if £50 m. or so of excess profits had bn. reserved as cushion

		for post-war diffies we cd. have avoided this situation.

	Must now face either subsidy or increased charges.

		I am opposed to subsidising rlways.



A.	Drawg. on war-time excess profits is not subsidy.



A.B.	Negotiations with l.a.’s in 1945 who wanted rlway. valuation for 

		rates to be raised to reflect war-time earnings.  We prevented

		them by legn.

	Ty. aren’t open to criticism for takg. excess profits.

	Where Ty. is wrong is in trying to fit rlway finance into annual

		Budgeting.  As with housing.

		Natd indies shd. have developmt. fund.  Private enterprise doesn’t		fetter itself with annual budgeting.  Margam is 50% above

		original estimate.

	When rlways were taken over, we shd. have planned in terms of 

		3-5 years.

	Political disadvantages of increasg. charges soon after natn.

	Let Exchequer put a fund at disposal of rlways.



B.	Over £700 m. of capital already.  Don’t want any more.

	If Ty. had put this aside fr. earnings, good.  But to put capital at their		disposal now, it wd. have same effect as watering capital.



A.B.	Development fund to stand as a debt v. rlways.



B.	Not a development fund – it’s to meet deficit on current working.



A.V.A.	But rlways must get into healthy condn qua current working.

	Urgent need for review of Govt. policy re charges of natd industry.

		Can you increase coal prices etc., &amp; refuse rlways same thing.	M’while, wiser to let Ty. carry burden of cost.



R.S.C.	If we put up £100 m. for Transport this year, we must raise it on

		Budget viz., by extra taxation.  Only removes the burden from		rlway user to taxpayer.



H.McN.	Increased charges won’t cure rlway’s ills.  They can’t hold road

		competn.  Tribunal expected increased charges wd. lose £10 m.		of traffic.  This means inflicting further permanent harm on 

		rlways.

	Must buy time somehow to get proper road/rail co-ordination.

		M/T. shd. tell us how long integration will take.  Then we can			see what it wd. cost to carry the rlways m’while.



C.E.	Annual budgeting is part cause of our trouble.

	New undertakings often make a loss for some years.



H.W.	Situation is no surprise.  Remember serious diffies of rlways in 1938.		And nothing done since then to favour rail as cpd. road.

		cf. petrol costs cpd. with coal.

	Our natn scheme was directed to transport, not rlways alone.

		Yet we are trying to balance rlway a/cs alone.

	We shd. wait for 2 things  a) road profits fr. undertakgs. coming

		under B.T.C. control b) increased petrol tax.

	Long-term remedy must be to make road traffic less profitable –

		esp. in c. licences, wh. are growing.

	Can’t go back on war-time settlement.  The excess profits have bn.

		spent by Exchequer.

G.A.I.	Another factor.  If charges are increased, no hope of holding wage 

		claims.



R.S.C.	Benstead takes opposite view – can’t hold wage claim unless they

		show they are putting rlways in posn to pay their way.



H.G.	Pay a subsidy &amp; workers will think they can have more wages.

		And it will spread to other natd industries.



J.	Can argue that both ways.

	But if anything warrants subsidy, this does – for it enters into all

		costs.



G.W.	Why shd. this money have to be found fr. current revenue, by taxn.

		Private enterprise wd. borrow.

	Maybe tht. it will pay us socially to run rlways at a loss.

	Must consider over-staffing of rlways.



A.B.	Deferred maintenance fund = £100 m.  cd. use part of that for

		3 years or so, during which time road profits cd. come in.



H.M.	Subsidy – bad advertisement for rlways.

	Road licence revenue:  cd. grant-in-aid for maintenance of rlway

		Perm-way be given out of that?  That wd. be arguable.

	Not satisfied tht. rlways have done enough on efficiency.

	Increased rlway wages.

	Govt. gave way on C. licences.

	Real decision now:  between – i) increased charges on condn of

		enquiry or ii) enquiry first.



E.Sh.	Enquiry into integration of natd indies.  N.C.B. have power to raise 

		prices, after askg. Minister if he concurs.  They have done so –

		against natd rlways.

	Worried over Ldn. passenger fare increases.

	Not worried over increased freight charges.

	16⅔% is a modest increase.

	You can’t put this on Exchequer.

	Authorise increased charges:  institute enquiry simultaneously.



H.G.	a)  Don’t know how much we cd. get out of roads.  Present profit

		from roads is v. small.  Don’t know how much it cd. be 

		worked up.

	Prospect of B.T.C. paying its way, w’out increased charges, is 

		v. remote.



B.	Agree:  Transp. Tribunal said no major change for some years.

	The big money on roads is in C. licences.

	We shan’t get enough road profit to cancel rlway deficit of £30 m.

	Also there is T.U. antagonism in road/rail.



P.M.	Cab. is reluctant to give decision in your favour w’out having 

	 	investign first.  How soon do you want decision?



B.	Staty Tribunal has reported.  P.Q.’s in H/C.  Imposs. for me to go on

		saying we can’t decide this.



E.B.	If Figgins knows Ty. are carrying rlways, even up to £20 m., the wages

		claim will be pressed.



P.M.	Enquiry by M/T. and H.G.

	M/T. to stall – no announcement until after Easter.

				[Exit  B.  Enter  M.W.



	5.	Farm Prices.



T.W.	As in memo.



R.S.C.	Satisf.  Farmers carry ⅔rds. of cost.



E.B.	Effect on c/living.



M.W.	.66 on c/living.

	Support main memo.



H.M.	Milk.  Is that justified?



T.W.	W’drawal of subsidy on animal feed.

	Will be later opportunity for Cab. to consider milk.



A.	Small producers – para. 10.

		Will 3(d) cover them?  Is it practical?



T.W.	I doubt it.  Gave figures of back-yarders.  No recoupment for them.



A.	Then there will be trouble.



H.G.	Drew attentn to fact that £12¼ m. includes £3¾ for increased freights.

		If no increase, farmers will get more profit.
