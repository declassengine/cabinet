C.M. 16 (50)					30th March, 1950



1.	    Parliament. Defeat of Govt. on 29.3.50

				            [Enter W.W.	

P.M.	Not tragic:  but lesson to our supporters to m’tain attendance.

	Shall be asked by W.S.C. to make a statement, I shall say we intend to carry on.



E.Sh.	One such incident doesn’t matter.  A series would.

	But let it be stated tht. we must be in H/C. – then all engagemts. can be declined.  All Whips to be 3-line Whips.



H.D.	Thought that was already the rule.  



E.Sh.	Not apparent from the Whip.



H.D.	Need for firm inquest.  Discipline.  Inform constituency Party of any who were absent y’day and voted r. Govt. on Seretse.



W.W.	Must also avoid overwork.  Health.  Can’t stand strain of e.g. all-night sittings.  Told Party y’day a.m. no-one shd. leave w’out definite pair.



A.B.	Two issues:

a)	Tighten up attendance – no room for misunderstanding.

b)	Ques.  wtr. member of Executive are entitled to vote r. Govt. on any issue.



H.M.	On A.B.’s doctrine, this Govt. can’t last.  In present Parly situation that kind of liberty has gone.

	On E.Sh. a) I spoke on this on earlier occasion.  Too many 3 line Whips will be crying wolf.  Onus must be on individual member to find out when it’s safe to be away.



J.G.	Only safe rule is to be at H/C. every night.



R.S.C.	Whips can ward off divisions from 3.30 to 7.pm.  That wd. ease the adminve burden of Ministers.



P.M.	Shan’t volunteer a statement unless W.S.C. asks for one.



A.V.A.	The Seretse revolt (to above) is v. serious.  If ½ doz. people think it’s clever to hold a pistol at Govt’s. head all the time, P.M.’s posn will be impossible.  



A.B.	Not always the same people.







2.	    Parliament. Business



H.M.		i) Business for next week.

		ii) Food:  we thought Press confce wd. be appropte.  But P.Q. down &amp; defended at his request;  &amp; Minister therefore prefers to announce in reply to P.Q.

		iii) Budget:  Parly. party wanted opportunity to make suggns to R.S.C.

			Don’t like that.  But they also asked for discn on Survey.

			And they may slop over into Budget.  Soln:  let Gaitskell  take discn on Survey only – next Wednesday.



A.B.	They want also to talk about Housing.  Gaitskell shd. keep 1951 housing open – as still under review. 



			(Agreed)



R.S.C.	Don’t let them discuss it until after we have taken Investmt P’mme.



R.S.C.	Wd. address Party immediately after Budget.



			(Agreed).

					           [Exit W.W.

			                           [Enter Henderson, Kirkpatrick, Noel Baker





3.	    Germany:  Iron &amp; Steel &amp; Coal Industries.



H.	One point in dispute – scope of liquidn.  3 firms (para 7.) – U.S. v. keen on moving down Stinnes’ firm because largely U.S. owned.

	Our view:  these firms shd. remain in cat. (a).  German T.U.’s support that view.  But likely to be diff. to get agreemt. if we insist on that.  And T.U.’s want settlement.  Possible concession:

                       |		insert genl. clause tht. any firm in cat. (a) wh. can be shown to be

                   x  |		more than 50% U.N. owned in 1939 may be moved into cat (c).

                       |		Dutch are similarly concerned about Thysseus.

	On procedure – T.U.’s wd. like compensn to be settled by G. Govt.  We fear they might be too dangerous to steel barons.   We favour standing firm.



R.S.C.	I agree.



A.B.	Meaning of para. 5?  What are we going to overbear?



H.	Old law contemplates tht. future pattern wd. be settled by Fed. Govt.

		Fr. weren’t parties to that.  They want it settled in Peace Treaty because industry internationalised.  They expect to be voted down.



A.B.	Read letter sent to P.M. in Oct ’48.(?)  Expd fear tht. law wd. enable G. Govt. to dispose of these indies.  First G. Govt. likely to be right-wing.  Likely therefore to hand indies back to private ownership.  Wd. make pacifn of Europe &amp; unity with E. Germ. more difficult.  I therefore proposed delay of 5 yrs. fr. start of new G. Govt.

	P.M. advised me to see E.B.  He advised me no point in consultg. U.S. Govt.  I found this v. unsatisf.  My U.S. friends tell me tht. strong U.K. pressure wd. force U.S. Govt. to change their view.

	Why now shd. we overbear French?  If they want internationn, why shd. we take onus of bringing these indies back into private ownership.

	Common ownership of these indies follows physical intergrn of the indies.

	V. ugly details likely in H/C.  We shall have helped U.S. capitalists to hand these assets back to steel barons.



H.	This law doesn’t touch ownership.  By preamble that is for G. Govt.

	Fr. are opposed to socialisation.  



A.B.	Is there any chance of it?



H.	Must leave it to decision of free democratic process.





H.McN.	Internatn was an alternative at one stage.

	But I don’t see how we wd. be able to do this now.



R.S.C.	What is status of law 75?  Is it in operation now?



H.	Yes – for Ruhr.   



K.  	As a law it’s there:  but can’t implement it w’out agreemt. in High 	Commn.



R.S.C.	If nothg. agreed, G. Govt. wd. have power to decide what’s to be done.  What we are doing here is 

			i) Applying law to Fr. Zone

ii) Making some adjustment in law to ensure tht. High 		    Commn can operate it.

	Sympathetic to A.B.  But can’t now go back on Law 75 unless we can persuade the other 2 Powers to alter it?  Can we?



P.M.	What is real French view?  



J.G.	Fear of having all this integrated again.  Don’t want it under G. control, public or private.  Hence international control.

i)	Can G. Govt. decide it at once!

ii)	Any internatl authy



H.	On ii) there is Ruhr Authority.  On i) no time limit.

E.Sh.	Para 7. implies concern by U.S. financial interests., to maintain Stinnes combine.  The two other firms are camouflage for that.

		Need assurances re use of Stinnes combine to rebuild G.’s war potential.



R.S.C.	High Commr. has bn. instructed to insist on keeping these in Cat. (a).



P.M.	What is Cab. view on compromise of x/?

	What are facts?



R.S.C.	Doubtful if Stinnes was more than 50% U.S. owned.

	Can’t support solution wh. omitted Stennis &amp; Thyssen.  Compromise suggd is safe for Stennis – tho’ perhaps not for Thyssen.



P.M.	Wiser to stand firm on Para 7. – with no suggn of compromise.

		Realise this risks break.

			                                                    [Exit H., Kirp. &amp; N. Baker



4.	    Future of Economic Controls.



H.M.	Recited history of 1945 Act.  Effect:  existg. legn based on what D. Regs. survived fr. war.  Act lasts until Dec. ’50:  prob. cd. get this renewed then.  But unsatisf. to carry on basis of survival fr. war-time powers.  Therefore propose legn in next session – limited field &amp; safeguards.

	Will be controversial.  But essential to planned economy.

		Full emplt., fair shares, price control etc.  Not a bad thing on wh. to have a break.  On Cttee points we cd. be put in diffies.

	Unsafe to rely on annual renewals.

	Authy for L.P. Cttee to make prepns on that basis.  In accord with Party policy = my Blackpool speech &amp; speech in Address.



P.M.	Go ahead with prepns.

	But imposs. to introduce in this Parlt.  Wd. be repd as totalitarian because powers much wider than you mean to use.

	Safer to go on year to year until we have bigger majority.

	Bad issue on wh. to go to country.



H.D.	Right to prepare the Bill or Bills.

	Need these powers if we are to continue as a Labour Govt.



R.S.C.	Yes:  but not sure we shd. legislate in this Parlt.

	Get it ready by all means.  But doubt if you cd. get it thro’ this year.  Will have to get renewal in Dec. ’50.



A.V.A.	What kind of Bill.  Look at L.P. 50.  I agree with P.M.

		Are you going merely to renew existg. powers or re-state the whole de novo.



E.Sh.	Our diffies over land acquisition.

	Perm-legn may be needed to call up Z. reserves.

	But legn on either of these ques. wd. be pol. dynamite.

	Favour looking at this.



P.M.	Prepare.  But tactically much better to have H/L. throw out powers now being used (on Address) than new Bill.



A.B.	Agree:  Powers are much wider than what you wd. use.

		Prepare Bill:  but go for Address.



C.E.	This is H.O. business.

	Agree to prepn of Bill.  But consider splitting this into 3 – 

a)	Econ. controls in genl. Bill sponsored by Econ. Ministers.

b)	Miscellaneous Powers needed permanently:  include in Bills as &amp; when.

c)	Annual renewal of things wh. are disappearing.



J.	My guess.  H/L. wd. renew S. &amp; Services for one more year.  But wd. 	not pass a new permanent Bill.

	Trouble + powers so much wider than you use.



E.Sh.	Consider covering mil. need in Army Annual

	                                  [Exit A.

P.M.	1) Prepare legn.

	2) Consider later when to introduce.  But certainly not in present Parliament, with this majority.



H.M.	Don’t be dogmatic on 2).  Let that ques. be reserved.



P.M.	I wdn’t choose to fight on a Bill of powers.

		Tho’ I wd. fight on need to have specific powers.



			                               [Enter M.W., G.S., H.G., N.B. &amp; Barnes



5.	    Economic Affairs



R.S.C.	Welcome views of colleagues on pop. version of Survey.

	Para 6.  Shall have full figures &amp; will give them to Cab. on Mon. &amp; to H/C. on Tuesday.

	Internal:  good progress.  9% up on last year – 71/2% increase in productivity – over 12 mos.  Provisional figures only.

	Press (cf. to-day’s Times) re man-power distribn.  In Survey we have bn. moving away fr. targets because lack of direction of labour.

		Tho’ other methods have bn. successful. e.g. textiles.	

	Coal-mines.  8.000 down on face-workers.



N.B.	N.C.B. regrets this:  but aren’t v. worried long-term.  Immed. problem is surplus in some fields &amp; shortage in others.  Transfer of workers in Scotland:  will have to be repeated elsewhere: &amp; if we can do it, prodn will rise greatly.  Social problems of transfer are diff. – incldg. housing.



R.S.C.	Other labour shortages – cotton, pottery &amp; some engineering. But on the whole pretty good.



P.M.	Overestimate of women leavg. industry.



R.S.C.	Consistent since 1945.



H.D.	Like under-estimating of prodn and productivity.



R.S.C.	And tendency to assume we have reached peaks e.g. in cars.



A.B.	Causes us to accept unnecessary political knocks.	



C.E.	Ship-bldg v. repairing?



R.S.C.	W. party on this – rpt. in months’ time

		But enormous increase in orders (bldg) in Feb.  Shd. help v. much.

		On repairs, we always knew labour force wd. have to come down when exceptional post-war repairs were completed.  



C.E.	Remember tht. this is a v. nervous (of unemplt) section of public.  



H.D.	Yes:  must continue vigorous action to put in alternative indies in these areas.

		Unemplt. figures in developmt. areas are moving wrong way.  



R.S.C.	This is seasonal move.



H.W.	Merseyside is miserable.



H.McN.	And W. Scotland is just as bad.



B.	Emplt. won’t fall disastrously on ship-repairing.  And M/L. have done well in absorbing those thrown up.



H.D.	Comparison with U.S.  Novel and dangerous.  Not a high standard of comparison.



C.E.	And why class N.I. with U.S.?



H.M.	This wd. cause annoyance if known.  And many U.K. Dpts. function there.  Sitn in N.I. is not healthy:  and that fact won’t help our relations with Rep. of Ireland.



H.W.	Developmt. Areas, generally.  More diff. to do anything now than 5 yrs. ago. – unless we can do more on cap. investment p’mme.

G.A.I.	Wages.  Suggd tht. earnings were dropping because over-time.



E.B.	The facts don’t bear it up.  Oct ’49: 1/8 = 3/- p. wk. on average.

	Wage-rates:  steady – 9 points above June ’47.

	Compared with retail prices – wages are keeping a little ahead.

		Aprl. ’49 &amp; Oct ’49 compared.

	Press are to be asked to stress this in order to answer E.B.’s point.

		Not even true tht. less overtime is being worked.



H.M.	Moral.  Movemt. for reduction of hours:  exposed as a device to secure more over-time.  



T.W.	Was a principle of T. Unionism.



A.B.	To share same amount of work among more people.  T.U.C. seized chance post-war to work it for more over-time.



R.S.C.	 In 12 months to Oct ’49 increased earnings of £250 m. p.a.  Answer to complaints re wage-freeze.



A.B.	And in an acceptg. in public sector disagreeable consequences of wage-freeze – even tho’ workers are getting the money.



E.Sh.	Isn’t it time we abandoned some of this rigid terminology?



R.S.C.	No:  we daren’t have increases in rates:  we allow increased earnings as safety valve, for it represents increased prodn.



G.T.	Watch repercussions on teachers.



H.D.	Depends where you are speaking (!)



E.Sh.	Coal exports.  Lawther’s speech of Geneva indicated surplus of coal esp. in Belgium.  Are we havg. diffy in finding markets.



N.B.	No:  not for good quality coal.  They cd. sell much more.

		But we shall have to work twds. Europ. coal agreemt.

	Coal output.  3.5% above 1949:  only 1% in Feby.  Believed partly due to working of P.A.Y.E. at end of financial year.  To keep markets.



J.G.	Be sure you don’t lose markets because prices are too high.  Begin to think about Europ. Coal Agreemt.



H.G.	We shd. run right into dual price problem.  Timing is important.



A.V.A.	Intended to go on running down food-stocks?  Well below Dec ’49.



R.S.C.	Last autumn we were over-full – not enough storage space.  Apart fr. that no policy of running down.  We are about normal now.

G.S.	Export of cars &amp; vehicles –

		90.3%:  92% of output is being exported by 2 main firms.



R.S.C.	Earlier fears re home market have bn. corrected.



			                                                        [Exit H.G., G.S. B., N.B.



6.	    Stocks of Animal Food.



M.W.	Have made enquiries – am re-assured.  Loss was not immoderate.



T.W.	Disposes of yarns in H/C.



H.D.	And well-written memo, too – a pleasure to read.



H.M.	But keep up scientific &amp; adminve drive r. this danger.



J.	Figures are so good – I can’t believe them.  No complacency.

		The serious menace of mice.



		Note taken – satisfaction.

					            [Exit M.W.



7.	   Finance of National Film Corporation.



H.W.	As in memo.



R.S.C.	Capital, not a gift.  Can’t escape this – tho’ I don’t like it.

		Hope B/T. will soon put up a long-term policy.



H.W.	Advances now made film by film.



H.M.	Means a further Bill.  Shall try to work it in.

	Surely we have had enough rpts. on this industry.  Sorry to hear H.W. still wants more facts.  Will be trouble on a Bill – if we have no policy settled.



H.W.	Only got last report in Dec.  W’out more facts I can’t assess financial potentialities of film production.

	Film Group of our party are attavist for full debate.

	First Annual Rpt. of Corpn v. soon. – cd. be debated.

	Wider discn than on a Bill.



H.M.	Opposn wd. have to take this for one of Corpn days.
