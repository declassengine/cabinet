			                                            [Enter W.W., Att G., B. and J.S.



1.	    Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.



H.M.	Speaker ruled out of order the amendmt.

	Presume Cab. won’t want to offer R. Commn on Divorce.



			Agreed:  No further action.





2.	    Parliament.



H.M.	Emergency Proclamn – to be confirmed by Parlt.

	Propose Wednesday of this week – if required.

	Will take some hours.



P.M.	Spokesman:  P.M. and Home Secy + Att. Genl. if required.



A.B.	Emphasise its seriousness.



			Agreed:  P.M. to open:  Home Secy. to reply unless legal points 

			               require answer by a L.O.





	Business for next week.                                  H/C. agreed.



	H/L.	Nat. Parks Bill.  T.C.P. wants it before summer adjournment.



			Agreed:  He can’t have it by then.

	Mountbatten Estates.  Oppn to our genl. Bill is growing in H/L.



P.M.	Get hold of Salisbury.





3.	    Dock Strike.



G.A.I.	Tooley St. – no change.  Tilbury normal.

	10.222 out:  112 ships idle:  56 lightermen have now come out.

	Nos. empld – 15.000 on Saturday.



R.S.C.	Is it true tht. a man who wants to go back can’t do so?  Or are all new ships stopped, by lock-out?



G.A.I.	No:  if men were ready to work, Can. ships they wd. be taken on.



P.M.	Victoria Park mtg. has by overwhelmg. majority voted in favour of remaining out on strike.



A.B.           x/	Have men bn. informed of telegram fr. President of Canadian T.U.C.



N.B.	Arrived Sunday – at 10 Downing St. (!)



G.A.I.	Substance has bn. made known to the men days ago.



E.B.	News Chronicle this a.m. is good descriptn of the situation.

	We can’t allow Comms. to transfer disputes here from overseas.

		If these ships were genuinely black I wd. sympathise with dockers.

		But Times this a.m. – even Canadian Union didn’t call strike.

		Use that also.  With x/ - in H.C.

	I wd. hang on.  But stop provoking action of morning call.  Continues “mass psychology”.  Close down until they are ready to work.  They will have enough of it in the end.



B.	Reply to R.S.C.  Can’t have a sitn in wh. any Comm. can “black” a ship.

	cf. consequences in Australia, where they choose what work they will do, on political grounds.  e.g. ships to Indonesia.

	Endangers whole of Dock Labour Scheme.



A.B.	Recalled Comm. strikes in 1923.  Men got fed up.

	Leave them alone - &amp; they will get fed up, with Comms. and not with us.

	We must stand firm.



Att.G.	Assume we are now commd to declaring Emergency.

	Ques:  what use we make of Emergency Powers?

		I put this suggn in at request of Emergencies Cttee.

	Asked also to advise wtr. Act gave enough power.  On the whole, yes.

	Is this strike or lock-out.  Govt. view: strike.  I’m not happy. Facts confused.  What began as a strike may have developed into lock-out.



E.B.	I agree.  Began as a strike.  Now it’s 70% lock-out &amp; 30% strike.



B.	Agree.  But principle: emplt. involves range of duties:  can’t allow a man to work one ship but not another.  Lock-out justified.



G.A.I.	Must go on with our declared intn of proclaiming Emergency.

		No chance of making men see reason.

		We are challenged on political grounds.

	What action we take under it.  Calm thought after Proclamation inclined to favour E.B.’s idea of dropping morning call.



C.E.	Emergencies Cttee wd. support Att. G. – subject to E.B.’s point!

		Suggest Cttee meet this p.m. to consider memo in light of E.B.’s statement.

	Stevedores mtg.  Voting on return to work v. close.  Barratt (Secy) is not playing fair with M/Labour.



H.M.	What use shall we make of powers?



B.	Appoint Port Emergencies Cttee at once.  Will work with Union:  build up labour force.  Eventually we shall have to take action r. the Stevedores Union.  



H.M.	What?



B.	None directly.  But under my enquiry I hope we wd. keep them out of opn of Dock Labour scheme.



E.B.	A break-away Union, 1923, under Comm. influence.

	Always v. orderly conduct of Docks.  Tried therefore to break my scheme. No discipline w’in Union.  Young Comms. i.e. and older men are holding aloof.

	T. &amp; G. W. Union have discipline over 26.000.

	Leave tactics to Emergencies Cttee.  But I wd. discontinue morning call.



C.E.	J.A. wants Port Emergencies Cttee called Em. Cttee because P.L.A. have a P.E. Cttee.



Att.G.	Must know what we are going to do.

	Will substn of one Cttee for another help?  Must have a plan.

	Danger of giving impn that Emergency Decln means nothing.



A.B.	Is it possible for a P.E. Cttee to hold a ballot?  Wd. it be boycotted?



G.A.I.	Leave that to Union.



E.B.	Delete:  “at once” from para 4 (b).
