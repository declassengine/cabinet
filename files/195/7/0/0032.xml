C.M. 36(49).				19th May, 1949.



	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  W.W.



H.M.	Business for next week.

	Adjournment for Whitsun, 3 – 21 June.



A.	H/Lds.  May be trouble over Ireland Bill.



J.	Jap. war criminals.  Shall say neither power nor desire to 

		intervene.





	2.	Telegraph Bill.                        [Enter  Paling, Gl. Hall &amp; Att. Gen.



W.P.	As in memo.

	Reason for legn:  to avoid waste of man-power.

		Individual notices wd. cause trouble to subscribers also.

	Legn necessary in any event for Hull, because it has its own system.



H.G.	Assumg. Bill passed by 1/7 increased charges cd. be recovered under

		existg. contract.  Only technical breach.  Tho’ subscriber wd.

		have to pay for one month before he had chance to terminate.

	Believe G.P.O. will have to go thro’ all contracts anyway.

	Man power figure = 20 mins per contract.  2 shd. suffice.

	Subscriber:  same trouble when he gets new bill.

	Para. 7 notice shdn’t go until R. Assent.  This proposal takes 

		remaining stages for granted.



W.P.	To cover longest notice (3 months) want to get notices out in June.



P.M.	There will be trouble in Parlt. if you do this.



A.B.	Trouble in H/C. over whole Bill.  Better give up some of Budget gains.



J.	Awkward to vary contracts by legn.



H.D.	Money Bill.  Presented in Budget.  Cd. have bn. in Finance Bill, if no 

		technical diffy. had prevented it.

	Ignore H/Lords.

	Only technical breach of contract.



Att.G.	Opposn &amp; newspp. will say its Govt. over-riding contracts.

	Admitted we varied contracts (teleph) once before this way – during

		war.



P.M.	Queried man-power estimates.	[Enter  E.B.



H.M.	Will increase operate during period when subscribers can’t

		terminate contracts.

W.P.	By indiv. notice we cdn’t begin to collect until beginning of next 

		financial year.



H.M.	What an inconvenient time.  But this is Budget.  Are you losing 

		money?



W.P.	No.



E.B.	Hate breakg. contracts.  Where does it end?  Example to T.U.’s.

		That was cause of Labour split in ’31.

	Wd prefer that Ch/Ex. shd. stand out of his £3 m.



Att.G.	Only relatively few contracts require 3 month notice.  Why shdn’t

		G.P.O. get those notices out in time to increase charge by 1/10.



H.D.	Further consultn betwn. RSC., W.P. &amp; L.O.’s to see what can be done

		w’out legn.



A.B.	By notice, stream of maddening notices in pre-election months.

	Legn wd. be worse.

	I wd. do neither.



E.B.	Can have 2nd thoughts even on a Budget.



N.B.	Wd be advantageous to drop this plan.  Outrageous to defend it on 

		basis tht. people use telephone too much.



P.M.             x/ Adjourn discn until R.S.C. can express his views.



E.B.	A natd industry.  What about contracts for coal or rlway rates?

		Are you going to break or vary trading contracts for revenue or

		other reasons.



Att.G.	They will say we wd. do it with insurance policies.  A v. damaging

		argument.

			Agreed:  Adjourn as at x/ because not ready to approve

			               legve method.

			               M’while investigate adminve methods of doing it

			               w’out legn, more shortly, or cost of doing it.



P.M.	Bill affects only rentals.  And less case for increasg. rental charge.

	Cdn’t R.S.C. put more on calls &amp; nothg. on rents?



Gl.H.	No:  wd. put far too much on calls.



	For Cab. Monday.                                [Exit  Gl. H., W.P., W.W.

			                                           [Enter  3 Serv. Ministers, G.S.			                                            C.K., E.E.B.





	3.	   Employment of Communists etc.

	(a)	   Secret Government Contracts.



A.V.A.	Public announcemt. preferable to procdg. by secret clause of contract.	Advisory body as for Civil Service.

	Wish to use same body  a) because indoctrinated on Security

			                     b) no more repves attend than for C.S. cases.	Para. 10.  Advice from S.G.  Think risk of actions may be accepted.



G.S.	Now in ridiculous posn.  Comm. in research establmt can be purged.

		But r &amp; d. contract to industry:  we can’t touch Comm. there.

		May delay important work.  Action secretly under contract clause 

		wd. provoke political row.  If we are to do this effectively, must 

		be a public statement.



H.	We have used powers.  But nos. are much larger.  We cdn’t make 

		widespread use of powers w’out new procedure.



Att.G.	Paras 9 &amp; 10 put legal posn.  Nothing to add.



G.A.I.	Endorse purpose.

	Form of Tribunal.  Diff. to get T.U.’s to accept existg. tribunal – even 

		tho’ T.U.C. take it.  Shd. consult B.E.C. as well as T.U.C.    	Thro’ Joint Consultve Council.  Try to get T.U.

		agreemt.



A.V.A.	Cdn’t vary Cab. decision, could you?



G.A.I.	May be inform in fact:  but call it consultn.



P.M.	Will employers want to be repd?



E.B.	No.  Nor will T.U.C.



A.B.	This isn’t so easy.

	Can’t field be narrowed down?  This is v. wide.

	Can’t you cure it by not offering contract?



G.S.	No.  Many occasions on wh. only one firm can do it.

	Prs. 12-20 people affected.



P.M.	I asked Serv. Dpts. extent of danger.  They put it v. wide.

		All v. well to remove ch. scientist.  What assurance they won’t

		go on to lab. boys?



E.Sh.	No provn here for appeal – as in C. Service – to Minister responsible

		for initiating action.



P.M.	To whom will advisory cttee report.



G.S.	To Minister.



P.M.	Then this is appeal to Minister, tho’ Minister isn’t in this case the

		employer.



A.B.	All depends on area over which this operates.  Must be kept w’in

		narrow bounds.

			C.P. 107. approved.

			P.M. to make (eventually) the statement in H/C.





	(b)	Outstations of Service Departments.



A.V.A.	Reviewed as result of P.M.’s intervention.

	Nos. to be covered reduced from 360.000 to 85.000.

	Unlikely that many of these will be subject of action.

	Ty. raised ques. (para. 5) wtr. words “have access” shdn’t be omitted		as going too far.  I wd. be ready to drop those words if others

		agree.



G.S.	Man may be workg. at Harwell not on secret work.  But common

		mess etc., &amp; he cd. pick up informn.



E.Sh.	I had to purge a messenger.



P.M.	“in connn with” wd. have covered that.



E.E.B.	P.M.’s announcemt. in March ’48 used certain terms.  Awkward to use		diff. words now.

			Approved, subject to using same definition as in Mar. ’48.



	(a)	Resumed.



H.M.	Warning re conjunction of M.I.5 and employer.





	4.	Greece                   [Exit Serv. Min., G.S., E.E.B., C.K., Att. Genl.



E.B.	If in discn I find it possible to go on &amp; settle Greece in isolation I wd.		do so.  Didn’t mean to convey tht. I wd. discuss only in context		of Balkans generally.

	Want concerted policy with U.S.

	Signs are tht. Tito has stopped interfering.  And since memo.

		heard tht. Albania are trying to open up ques. with U.S.A.

		We have much to settle with Albania – our compensn for

		Corfu channel, end of hostilities with Greece.



P.M.	These are optimum wishes.

	You want a free hand to act w’in (?) those.



H.M.	Suppose Greeks claim rights of complete suppn of a Comm. Party.



E.B.	They wdn’t.  They wd. trust public opinion to out-vote them.

	Supervision of elections – preferably by Scandinavia, not by 

		Big Powers.

	Also wd. be opportunity to clear it up in discn of amnesty terms.



A.V.A.	No objn to general lines of memo.

	But anxious about Military posn.  In last opn Gk. Govt. forces 

		damaged.  Not clear that rebels have lost.  Pity if, just as Govt.

		getting on top, rebels were given chance of getting a second

		wind.



A.B.	Para 2. – involves surrender  ?  of individuals.



E.B.	Prob. not – hand in arms &amp; return to farms.



N.B.	Distinguish betwn. hard core (15%) of organised Communists and

		remainder.  Evce tht. latter this year want to surrender.  25% of

		whole force have come over.

	Believe rebels are much weaker than ever.  Govt. forces have done

		v. well.



P.M.	Tito’s w’drawal of help may be big factor.



N.B.	R. attitude may be comparable with air lift.  May see end coming &amp;

		want to avoid discredit of actual defeat.



C.J.	Cyprus.  Much of our trouble inspired from Greece.  Not Communist

		problem only.



E.B.	Not only fr. Gks. – some from U.S. meddlers also.  But U.S. now 

		realise we must hold Cyprus.



			Memo. approved.





	5.	Equatorial Nile.



E.B.	Uganda, U.K. &amp; Egypt.  Agreement reached.

	Power for Uganda.  Bigger than T.V.A.

	Must now go on &amp; settle Lake Tana.

	Will give E/Sudan a mixed agriculture.  More food, jute &amp; higher

		living standards.



P.M.	Congrats. to E.B.



E.B.	Want to announce in H/C. to encourage (myself) ourselves &amp; others.
