C.M. 8(49)							28th January 1949



		Council of Europe.



E.B.	Cttee. married the 2 conceptns – result, a v. loose scheme.

	Cab. approved my alternative.

	Now Consultative Cttee. has produced modified proposals – in CP.18.

	Para.(1). Keeness for propn. of repves fr. Parliaments.  Tho’ they intended to exclude some factions eg. Gaullists.  I suggested therefore tht. each country shd. be free to decide its own method of repn.

	Para.(2). Original plan : freedom to put on Agenda but subject to veto of Ministers. Thought that unfortunate.  Hence, have reversed it.

	Para.(3). Thought free voting wd. be embarrassing.  Others, however, much wanted it. Now clear tht. we can handle our delegation as we like – can “put Whips on” at will.  Tho’ delegates vote individually.

	In T.U.’s block voting is by custom, not rule.

	Can get agreement on this basis and issue communiqué tonight.

	Was tendency to limit this to Brussels Powers.  Pressed to bring Italy into U.S. think she must be associated somehow.  Think W. Union defence. It might be enough to bring her in on ground floor as founder member of this Assembly. U.S. wd. be satisfied with that.



R.S.C.	Para.(1). “Each country” may be claimed to = Parlt.  Will be awkward.

	?” procedure decided by its Govt. …..”		Agreed.



A.B.	Better “Each Govt. shall be free …..”



H.D.	R.S.C.’s formula is better.  Allow Govt. to decide to leave choice to its Parlt.



R.S.C.	Para. 2(b). Second sentence cd. be deleted. Will look v. bad.

	Only need is to safeguard v. oppositional groups raising ques. That is covered by ⅔.



N.B.	Ministers, also, wdn’t turn down somethg. wanted by ⅔ of Assembly.



H.D.	Para. 9 of Sub Cttee. Rpt. was in line with Para.(2) as it stands.



A.B.	Wd. rather put majority up to ¾ via ⅔.



P.M.	Isn’t this necessary to prevent Assembly discussg. matters allocated to other bodies?



R.S.C.	That goes too far. All subjects covered. This can discuss their European aspects.

	Make it ⅔ of membership.



E.B.	Wd. conflict with Para. 3.



R.S.C.	Not if expressed as 66 votes.

A.B.	Avoids powers of abstention.



E.B.	Leave it to me to raise the point and invite discn of it with repves of other countries.



J.	Who will decide what is a military ques?



E.B.	That’s why I wd. prefer to have last sentence of 2(b): altering it, if need be, to simple majority.



A.B.	Easy to give Min. Cttee. specific power to define what is a military ques.



E.B.	Diff. to distinguish betwn. economic and military ques.



A.	Incline now to retain last sentence.



H.D.	Reversal of our vote to press for its omission if others want it.



P.M.	Series of directives only.  Why not make this more genl.  Instruct Cttee. that Scheme shall also be worked out to ensure tht. Min. Cttee. shall have power to control discn. of military ques. and similar matters by the Assembly.



N.B.	For existg. sentence: In case of doubt Min. Cttee. shall decide what is mil. ques.



J.	Wider phrase : matters [of high policy] concerned with defence.



P.M.	Agree = restrictg. veto to defence ques.

	Or put it tht. Min. Cttee. have a right to remove from agenda (by simple majority) ques. of defence or other matters[policy] wh. they think it inexpedient to have discussed.



J.	“Matters affectg. national security”.

	“Matters of defence and related policy”.



	After further discn. – E.B. asked leave to allow 2(b) to stand unaltered.

	Generally left that he cd. do as he pleased. All to be examined by Permanent Commn. No details will be in communiqué.



N.B.	Will Eire be invited?



E.B.	Not decided.



P.M.	Layton pressg. for Govt. support for W.S.C.’s society.



E.B.	Not until this settled betwn. Govts.



H.D.	Agreed.
