C.M. 24(49)							31st March 1949



		1.	Parliament.		[Enter Mayhew, Att.Genl. and W.W.

						   E.Sh. and Henderson.

H.M.	Business for next week.

	Tuesday : Meat in Cttee of Supply.



R.S.C.	May prejudice Argentine negotns. – more anxiety we show, stiffer Argentines will become.  Also M/F. is ill.  Agreed : Invite Opposn. to choose another subject.



A.B.	Taking Coast Erosion Bill on a Friday, after introducg. in H/L. will write down its importance.  After discn, agreed.



H.M.	Agric. Marketing Bill.  C.W.S. views.  We mustn’t overlook consumers interest.



T.W.	This Bill caters for it, more than anything earlier. eg. thro’ Consumers’ Council and its access to Minister.  Minister will appoint 1/5th of Marktg. Bd. (consumer interest).  Also, Cl. 4 empowers Minister to direct standstill pending enquiry if consumer interest seems to be threatened.



H.M.	Promise to give sympathetic answer in H/C. to suggn. of C.W.S. member on Bd.



T.W.	Bill provides qualifns. 



P.M. 	Phrasing doesn’t suggest C.W.S. or consumer interest :  



H.M. 	Why not add words referring directly to consumer interest: and give sympathetic answer re C.W.S. member.  “Representing Organised consumers”.

				Agreed.



	Censorship of Plays Bill.



P.M.	Cab. decided we shd. say we were opposed to this Bill, tho’ not on principle.

	C.E.’s speech was such tht. one Member of Govt. voted for it - said Govt. was neutral.



C.E.	I must have misunderstood Cab. decision.  Hadn’t seen Minutes before I spoke.



P.M.	This affects Royal Prerogative?



J.	Threatens Act 1843 extinguished Prerogative right – transferred it to statute.



P.M.	Bill must be prevented from passing into law.





2.	War Crimes : German Generals.		[Exit W.W.



E.Sh.	Over past months medical repts. have bn. conflictg.  Early March Genl. Robertson reported them fit : but subsequent rumours moved me to have special examn.  Results reported in App.  Two unfit for trial but Manstein fit.



	Dilemma : criticism for letting unfit men be tried.

		      criticism if we let them go.



	Can’t have a court to decide on fitness.  We must decide.

	If we don’t try them, do we hand them over to Soviet?  We propose not.

	Manstein : we think we shd. try him, if he is to be tried, not hand him over to Soviets.

	Suppose we don’t try first two, what are we to do with them?  Leave that until later.



P.M.	Rear guard action by W.O. continues.

	Para. 8. Runstedt said to be fit to give evce for defence.  If fit for that, he is fit for trial surely.



H.	F.O. favour acceptg. medical recommn but think court shd. decide.  Put them on trial and let court say they aren’t fit.  That wd. dispose of any claim by Soviets etc.  Also decn wd. be taken openly.

	Manstein trial shd. go fwd.  Will look v. odd if R. is allowed to 

                   x/.	give evce for defence – he may, with immunity, say he is responsible for M.’s crimes.

	3 Power Agreemt. Art. 4 of Law 10 is the operative legal provision.

	C-in-C. has discretion to w’hold delivery of war criminal.

	But on merits all claims cd. be resisted if all 3 went for trial and court.



Att.G.	Supported W.O. view.

	F.O. view wd. involve continuing prepns for case – delay and expense.

	In U.K. Crown takes respons. for abandoning procdgs. if a man isn’t fit.



R.S.C.	Favour F.O. view.  Important tht. court shd. decide on fitness – otherwise will appear to be a ramp.  Also x/.

	Initial appln to court on fitness.



J.	Precedents in U.K. for leaving court to decide.



A.W.  	 x/. could be met by trying Manstein first.



A.	Not impressed by medical reports.  Blood pressure is good for their age and condition.

E.Sh.	Do we assemble court to decide on fitness?  Then adjourn to complete prepns of case?



Att.G.	J.A.G. shd. have opportunity to consider wthr. this is legally possible.



P.M.	Anyway we are not going to take final decision on fitness.



A.V.A.	No further long delay.  Repugnance of public opinion 1949.



	Agreed : Manstein to be tried.

		   Court to consider at once (if legally possble)

		   wthr. other two are fit.



A.	Motion in H/L. – deferred to 5th May – B/Chichester.

	Hope we may have.

							[Exit Att.Genl.

					  		      Henderson.





          	3.	War Victims : Geneva Conventions.



	            Approved.					[Exit E.Sh.





          	4.	Sale of “Ajax” to Chile.			[Enter Dugdale.



D.	Apologise for earlier error.

	Objns to selling any ship to Chile now – because Argent/Chile disputes.

	In this country objns to selling this particular ship.



R.S.C.	Long trade connn. with Chile over warships.



M.	F.O. are neutral : we can’t object to the sale.  Chile is pro Br. traditionally and haven’t bn. troublesome recently over Antarctic.  My own view is against selling the Ajax, for sentimental reasons.



A.V.A.	Don’t let this ship be sold.  £200.000 as she lies : hoped Chile wd. spend £400.000 or so on refit.  Scrap value : £40.000.



	Agreed : Refuse Ajax : offer choice of others.
