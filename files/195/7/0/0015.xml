C.M. 15(49)							24th February 1949



		1.	Parliament.				[Enter W.W. &amp; Att.Gen.



H.M.	 Business for next week.





		2.	British North America Bill.



H.M.	A.P.H. Motion for p’ponement on grounds of impendg. appeal to Privy Council fr. Newf.



	Discussed with Att. G.  Judicial Cttee might uphold it.  But we mustn’t admit tht. Parlt. can be held up by action in courts.  Intend therefore to reject this argument.  Warning Spker.  Necessary tht. legn. go thro’ by 13/3. Canadian Parl. is moving.



Att.G.	Possibilities.	a)	P. Council might say it involves repeal, in reln.      	                         to Newf., of S. and W’minster.  Awkward : for  			Doms wd. not hold tht. W’minster Parlt. can 			amend S. and W.

			b)	U.K. Parlt. can’t repeal S. and W. because 				involves conveyance of pol. rights to Doms. 				J.R.’s view : I don’t agree with it.  On that view 			P.C. wd. rule this Act not valid in Canada or N.



			Agreed : Proceed as H.M. recommended.



						[Exit Att. Gen.



		3.	Private Members Bills.



H.M.	Hunting and Coursing : as already decided.  Wales: oppose. A.B. to help.





		4.	Civil Service : Membership of Local Authorities.



H.M.	Members running for l.a. elections – members of C.O.I.  E.E.B. and C.O.I. think that, as C.O.I. under pol. fire, rule that none of the staff shd. run as Party pol. candidate.  M/H. have such rules for special reasons.

	Two H.E.O.’s wishing to stand – for Lambeth and L.C.C.  Wd. involve Party political activities.

	Propose to endorse this rule.



P.M.	Certainly – in a propaganda Dpt.



G.T.	Make rule apply to l. govt. elections as such, not with Party affiliations.

	Can’t draw the line.

							[Exit. W.W.

							[Exit C.E.

		5.	Indonesia.



E.B.	Trouble with Dutch.  They mayn’t come across, even now.  Reluctance to release republican leaders.

	Amb. and other Brussels Powers repves saw For. Minister y’day.  Told Dutch intend confce 12/3 in The Hague for transfer of power on 1/5. No public announcemt. until week-end.  U.N. Commn has to report by 1/3.

	No time to appreciate world re-action or to communicate with I. and P.

	Another failure will produce v. serious situation.  Fr. are comg. to decision re Indo. China – about equal to our advance in Malay.  Need is for Dutch to produce their solution in handsome enough way.

	Need to consolidate posn in S.E.A.



R.S.C.	Send messages to H. Comms. in P. and I. to act in a flash as soon as news breaks.



E.B.	Will consider.

	Dutch are estranging U.S. and Australia.  V. ham-handed.  Tho’ a. v. courageous and frank speech recently made by Dutch Foreign Secretary.





		6.	Burma.



E.B.	B’leg’s mission going well and confce is being arranged – tho’ Burma hasn’t agreed to attend.  Good outcome of this.  Answer to Indian initiation is convening confce. on Indonesia.

	But now ques. of mil. assistce v. Karens.  Two factors.  Don’t hold with encouraging Karens to violence.  But on merits hard to support B. Govt.  They shd. accept mediation eg. by Comm. repves and cd. settle it.

	But under Treaty obliged to give mil. help.  Assumed tht. was only v. external aggression.  Does it oblige us on internal trouble to give help?



R.S.C.         x/  Was contemplated they might need support v. Comm. – internal.



P.M.	But not to support B. hierarchy v. Karens.

	Shd. tell them clearly – no arms for that.



E.B.            x/	Will therefore circulate draft telegram for considn by Burma Cttee. x.

	Need for clear warning.  Fighting must stop.

	Shd. we do it thro’ coming confce or unilaterally?



R.S.C.	Bottomley wd. do it well because he was in earlier talk with Karens etc.,



N.B.	Our line shd. be : no mil. and no financial support unless they settle with Karens.  

P.M. 	Agreed.



N.B.	As to x/. Comms. = external aggression nowadays.

				

							[Enter J.S. and Freeman.



		7.	European Long-Term Programme.



R.S.C.	Brought to Cab. in case any points raised – sweated thro’ E.P.C.

		Para. 107 gives conclns.  Modified one of these in E.P.C. to meet M/F.



A.	Two comments:

	a) P. 17.  Impact on Comm. Where will this lead qua. Canada.



R.S.C. 	Will be a special memo on that.



A.	In that review hope a/c. will be taken of Can. reaction, not only to W. Eur. policy, but also to E. Eur. policy.  Clutterbuck Tel. 208.

	…… deliberately seek to replace Can. purchases by bringing fr. behind Iron Curtain.  Polish and R. purchases baffle Canadian opinion.

	Don’t sacrifice our best friends for ephemeral advantage.



R.S.C.	Not in substitn it’s where we haven’t dollars to buy fr. Canada.



A.	Then we must find a diff. approach re. dollars.



R.S.C.	Must face the facts.



N.B.	It is serious : but Canadians are beginning to understand our reasons. Recent speech by St. Laurent.



J.S.	Avoid being put by Canada into posn. tht. if we can’t buy bacon from them we mustn’t buy it at all.



	Memo approved.				[Exit J.S. and Freeman





		8.	Council of Europe.



E.B.	Brussels Powers must agree in advance – otherwise whole issue will be re-opened.



	a) Voting in Cttee. of Ministers etc.  In view of economic ques. need to have safeguard of ⅔ majority.

R.S.C.	Only doubt is about Assembly initiating discns.  Won’t it be too restrictive?



E.B.	Must be, in early stages.  Exp. to prevent overlapping with eg. O.E.E.C.

	Also to avoid discn. of ques. affecting Commonwealth.

H.M.	Each country has a Minister on Cttee. – gives more propte power to small countries.  This is reason for ⅔ .  Otherwise, will be demand for more than one Minister on Cttee. for larger Powers.



H.D.	Begin tight and loosen up later if it proves justifiable.



A.B.	I agree : but this is v. tight indeed.



E.B.	No : wish we had this in U.N.



N.B.	Try for this.  If Assembly does well, we shall have to give more discretion– and may want to.



E.B.	Suppose a Cttee. rejects something (on ⅔ basis).  Shd. initiating Govt. be free to get it mooted in Assembly with consent of simple majority on Cttee.



A.B.	Cd. you include provn. tht. procedure shall be reviewed in 2 years’ time.



E.B.	Not in constitn.  But intend to say somethg. like that to Consultve. Council.



	b)	Functions and Powers.



R.S.C.	Prefer positive statement : no legislative powers.  Agreed.



	c)	Para 10.



R.S.C.	Does (b) mean by ⅔ majority. 



E.B.	Yes : but w’out consent of Cttee. of Ministers.



H.D.	Someone will have to decide what is a social or cultural ques. – or what is w’in O.E.E.C. Eg. social aspects of economic integration proposals.



E.B.	Intended tht. Cttee. of  Ministers shd. decide.  First Agreed : make this clear.



H.M.	Better to omit (b).  All social ques. are economic – or have financial implications.	Finally Agreed : omit (b).



	d)	Procedure.



H.M.	We shd. be thinking about this.

	Get advice of eg. Campion.



E.B.	Get rid of rostrum.

	Size of room.

P.M.	Avoid elaborate new bldg.  Don’t give room for Press.  Or public.



e)	Voting.



	In 11(b) insert “without debate”.  Agreed.



	c). 	Para. 10 resumed.



J.	Oppose (c) (iii).  Covered in O.E.E.C. ques. economics.



A.B.	State inhibitions. (Nat. Defence and econ. subjects covered elsewhere) positively and leave the rest open.



P.M.	Narrow it too much and you will restrict it to racialism etc.



H.M.	Prefer to say, subject to consent of Cttee.  Assembly can discuss anything save only Nat. Defence.  Specific mentions invite debate.



E.B.	Discn of dependent territies.  Not a bad thing. eg. soil erosion.  Not a legislative body.  Congress will discuss because of Truman Point 4.



R.S.C.	Risk = freakish resolns which will cause troubles in the territories.



N.B.	Will ⅔ of them adopt freakish resolns?



P.M.	Para. 8.  Will Ministers be in Assembly?



E.B.	No : contemplated, however, they cd. address Assembly.

	Said, however, this will turn it into Eur. Vote of censure on Minister if his views aren’t endorsed.

	Work it on U.S. model.



A.B.	Weight of work on Ministers will break democratic machine.  If this Assembly has right to call on Ministers to address them. eg. amount of F.O. work on this.



H.M.	Sympathise.  But odd show.  No leadership.  See you can’t have a Ty. Bench.  But how will they go w’out guidance?



A.W.	Cd. Cttee. have right to let its members sit in Assembly?



A.B.	Minister attendg. wd. have to represent Cttee. of Ministers.



A.	Shdn’t be allowed to develop into inquest on policies of Ministers.



N.B.	Alarmed at conceptn of delegations without Ministers.



H.M.	Is this to be a Summer School or a delegn with some leadership?

	Potentially a Parlt. of Europe.  V. dangerous to have no leadership.



P.M.	Then you imply Ministerial responsibility to Assembly.  Can’t constitutionally.

	On other hand, if no Ministerial hardship, might not be possible to confine delegn to supporters of Govt.



G.T.	A breath of common sense!



E.B.	Agree.  Improvise and grow.



H.D.	No agreemt. at Paris.  Then U.K. view tht. delegns shd. be nominated by Govts. and vote in a block.  Fr. rejected that.  They have many Veteran Ministers of Parties supportg. Govt.   Fr. opposed Ministers being in Assembly.  I favoured natl delegns being led by a Minister. Shd. delegns represent all Parties?  I said don’t want Comms.  Fr. said Parlt cd. elect but wdn’t elect Comms. (He admitted Italian Parlt. cdn’t be trusted to find means of not electg. Comms.)

	Some Fr. expected growing co-absence of Soc. Democr. repves etc.

	No gt. thought given to it.

	We shall have to decide wthr. Opposn. Parties shall be included in our delegn.

	Developmt. in Assembly will turn largely on decn on that ques.



A.B.	Do you want it to be a body involvg. Govts. at all?

	Or focal point for discn of Europe’s problems.

	I favour first alternative, until we see how it develops.



R.S.C.	May give it too much authy if you associate Ministers with it.



P.M.	As you might be allowing U.K. delegn to be a single block.

	Must clear our minds as to where this is to lead.  If  twds. a Parlt. of Europe, we must decide wthr. we bring Opposn. in.



E.B.	Will submit separate memo. on this.  I attach most importance to Cttee. of Ministers – with general, not specialised scope.



A.B.	Agreed : too early to formalise.

	genl. disposn to exclude Ministers fr. Assembly.

	effect on this document (para. 10) is that it is easier to allow freedom of discussion because not a responsible Assembly.





		9.	Austria : Establishment of New Political Parties.



E.B.	Intended to end all this kind of control when we ended state of war with Austria.  Attention only recently called to continuance of this particular control.

	Propose therefore to say we shall not in future interfere with this.

	Not our business.

H.M.	Vice. Ch. of Austria said:  on left vote is split by Comms.

				       on right, it isn’t because of this prohibn.

	Prohibition is thus penalising the Parties of the Left.



N.B.	Ques. of principle shd. be decisive.



A.B.	Support memo.



	Memo. approved.
