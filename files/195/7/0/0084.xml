2.	    Housing Programme.



R.S.C.	Need to stabilise over a period of years.

	Read proposed statement for Budget speech.



A.	What about other investment.



R.S.C.	Take this as a fixed preference:  rest of p’mme must fit in.



H.D.	Welcome this because views expd in election campaign.

		Will give great satisfn.

		Passionate feeling at Party mgt. on this point.



H.W.	Expand last sentence – attributg. it to increased productivity.



R.S.C.	No:  wd imply a larger total for investment in ’50.  Doubt if that’s justified.  Don’t want to prejudge discn of this on I.P.C. report.



H.W.	Materials.  Timber is more diff.  But welcome this statement qua buying tactics.  Soft-currency timber people have bn. trying to blackmail us.



H.McN.	200,000 figure.  In Scotl. we had planned to absorb cut by redcg. standards &amp; size.  I won’t go back on that:  so I shall be able to build more.



R.S.C.	The figure will be marginal.



H.McN.	So long as it’s understood tht. this total isn’t used to cut down my numbers.



G.T.	Will impact fall wholly on s. service sectn of i. p’mme?



R.S.C.	No:  over p’mme as a whole.



A.V.A.	Private licensing.  Will you now cancel Nov. decision.  Bears v. heavily on lower idle classes.  People who are waitg. to build own house.



A.B.	Welcome. R.S.C.’s proposal.  But this isn’t v. ambitious p’mme.

		Tho’ we can brag about housing standard of U.K.

	Private Licensing.  Not for Budget.  Wd prefer to put it separately to Cab.  And wd. wish to revise my earlier proposal for restoring consumer demand:  offering those at head of waiting list choice of l.a. house or license to build own house.  With safeguard:  that not more than 5% (or ? 1 in 5) private licences be granted without special enquiry.



1.	Statement for Budget – approved.

2.	M/H. &amp; S/S. Scotland to submit memo on “private” licensing.





3.	    The Budget.



R.S.C.	Read passage proposed for Budget speech.

	Best form of presentn – to show conscious of diffy. &amp; appreciate problem – how to distribute fruits of extra prodn betwn. producers.



P.M.	Include refce to rank &amp; file.  T.U. leaders &amp; members.



A.V.A.	This cd. be exploited by Comms. – unless margins betwn. different classes of workers is made clear.



R.S.C.	That is then.



A.	Shd. be in words wh. can be understood by workers.

 		Estabd wage differentials…  We haven’t yet found solution.

		Say what you mean:  i.e. deal fairly with low-paid worker w’out endangering genl. scheme.



R.S.C.	No.  Problem = how distribute fruits of extra prodn so as to reward lower-paid while preservg. differentials.



G.A.I.	“Establ? wage relations betwn. various grades of workers” is better phrase.

		My Dpt. cd. help with drafting.



G.T.	Suggests tht. all we have to do is to share out fruits of prodn.

		And we note increased earnings.

	But what of those outside prodn – whose effort can’t be measured in terms of output.

	This gives imprn tht. producers are only problem.

	And what of black-coat who is now rewarded less than “worker”?



P.M.	“Distribute fairly the extra wealth created by expanded prodn”.  wd. be a better phrase.



J.G.	Wd. prefer to omit { } on p. 2. altogether.



R.S.C.	Omit “fairly… share of.



H.McN.	“By product on p. 1.



A.B.	“were met by” vice “by-product.”
