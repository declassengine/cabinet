	1.	Parliament.	[Enter  W.W.

	2.	Visiting Forces.                     [Enter  Att.G., Wheatley &amp; Younger			                                                                Exit  W.W.

J.	As in memo.



Y.	Some hope of securing U.S. agreement.



Att.G.	No comment.



C.E.	One trouble:  U.S. penalties for some offences more severe than ours.



Att.G.	No trouble over that if concurrent jurisdn allowed.



A.B.	Shd. we not make it condn tht. when victim of offence is not U.S.

		citizen jurisdn of U.S. court-martial wd. not be admitted in

		practice.



Att.G.	They wdn’t agree.  For as matter of discipline they insist on trial by

		ct. martial, with the heavier penalties available.



A.V.A.	i)	We shd. ask for reciprocity.

	ii)	Rape.  We shd. ask for arrangemts. at least as good as those made

			with other Comm. countries.

		We shd. have no less favourable treatment than under 1933 Act.



Att.G.	U.S. wdn’t concede us exclusive jurisdn for murder &amp; rape.

			Agreed:  Re-examine &amp; bring up		[Exit above three.

			               again.  Let Cab. know the facts.





	3.	Balance of Payments.



R.S.C.	Read Statement.



H.D.	Results v. good.  But isn’t statement rather long?  Will it be reported

		in full?



R.S.C.	V. important fr. U.S. pt. of view.  Advised  necessary to do this at

		length.



H.W.	Give corresp. figures for 1st quarter of ’49.  To show it isn’t seasonal

		improvement.



G.W.	Seeing H. Commrs. to-morrow at noon – to discourage excessive

		optimism.



A.	Over sanguine re continuance of exports to dollar areas?



R.S.C.	No.



H.G.	Still over 200 m. below level of reserves when E.R.P. began.



R.S.C.	Don’t want to mention that – in case we shd. get there.   Moving now

		to higher minimum – in case U.S. say we need no more.



G.T.	Don’t be too gloomy.  Workers don’t react well to it.



H.M.	Congrats. to R.S.C. &amp; other Ministers concerned.



			                                           [Enter  H.H.M. &amp; Summersk.

	4.	Scales of National Assistance.



E.S.	As in memo.  Repercussions on insurance rates – not serious because

		small propn of those in insurance benefit who ask for supplemn.



H.H.M.      x/	Prob. no repercussions on war pensions.  Will aid the more needy war

		pensioners.



T.W.	Effect on individual constituency case.



P.M.	Not for Cabinet.



G.A.I.	No objn.  But care in presentn – to avoid encouraging wage movements.

		Do it as part of genl. review of Bd’s work:  But don’t relate it to

		c/living.  I want to see the statement in draft.

E.S.	Propose to announce on Thurs.  Didn’t want to follow too soon on 

		M/F. prices.  Don’t want the two associated.



A.B.	Agree.  And how can M/N.I. defend except by refce to c/living rise?

		Needn’t emphasise it:  but can’t deny it.



H.M.	To dissociate the two, the Assistce scales must come first.

		Do it to-day.

			Agreed:  Announce it to-day.



H.McN.	Are we sure we are right on merits.

		Diff. to avoid repercussions.  Diff. to deny it’s because of

		c/living.

		Sure therefore come into argument over wages.

	Is this the best moment to do this?  Politically, better to hold this up

		for 6 months.



J.G.	Can’t with-hold them.  Cd. only publish and reject.



H.M.	I’m also worried.  Chairman of Bd. was politically over-active last

		year.

	Serious repercussions.  Suppl. Estimate for £10 m. in 1950/51.

	Bd. haven’t taken a/c of concessions e.g. on tobacco to o.a.p.

	Believe this will be caught up in wages.

	Is M/P. sure about repercussions on w. pensions?



H.H.M.       x/	There will be repns for increase in w. pensions based on this.

		But I said I wd. resist that on basis that this improvemt.

		accords with our policy of easing hardest cases.



H.M.	Cd. C.S.O. &amp; Social Survey get us some more facts?



A.B.	No credit given for help to old people fr. N. Heath Service –



H.M.	And other Social Services.



P.M.	Against p’ponement.  Will be accused of electioneering.



R.S.C.	We don’t think husband &amp; wife can live on 40/=.  That’s our real

		reason.



A.B.	Then we must relate it to c/living:  &amp; let M/L. point go.



H.M.	Do we bring them down when c/living falls?



J.G.            y/	Let’s say tht. the Bd., havg. regard to all the circs., have put up these		scales.  Don’t be drawn into justifying them by refce to figures 		of c/living.



H.D.	Esp. as Govt. have no power to modify proposals of Bd.

G.W.	Para. 2.  The proposals have not bn. formally presented.

	Don’t ignore the repercussions.



R.S.C.	Best value, by way of relief, we can get for £10 m.  This is just

		the sort of thing we shd. do.  Better than tax relief.



G.W.	Wd. have liked to look at this £10 m. in conjunction with discn of

		N. Health Service.



H.McN.	I’m not a Scrooge.  But be sure this will provoke demands fr. other

		groups.  And we shan’t be able to avoid arguments re c/living.

			Agreed:  Approve.  Defend on basis at y/.

			               Announce as soon as possible.  To-day.

			                      After consultn with M/L. (H.M.  And me.)





	5.	National Health Service.



R.S.C.	Two points –

		a)	Is £392 m. a sum we can permanently devote to this.

		b)	What are we to do when demands are made for expansion –

			e.g. capital investmt. for hospitals.  Clear we can’t expect to

			refuse them all – or to shut down other parts of Service to 

			pay for them.  Then you must have some other way of 

			keepg. w’in. ceiling.

	My proposals:

		a)	To cut down ceiling in future to £350 m.

		b)	To take power to charge for some services.

	Haven’t made specific proposals under b).  We’ve decided already

		to charge 1/= for prescriptns:  but that will raise less than £6 m.

		Other poss. charges will have to be explored after Cab. have

		approved the principle.



A.B.	H.McN. discusses in his memo. particular charges.  I haven’t done so

		because prelim. issue = political ques. of principle.

	Remember power to charge wd. require legn.  Opposn haven’t asked for

		this power to be taken.  V. painful pill for Labour supporters.

		Prs. diff. to get such a Bill passed.

	Some expansions are necessary.  Capital investmt in hospitals shdn’t be

		regarded as revenue charge in first yrs. of a new Service.

		Reasonable tht. they shd. be spread.



P.M.	How much is being spent on this?



A.B.	V. little.  Shd. be more.  Housing for Army is now admitted as capital

		charge.  Money for expansion shd. not come on revenue.  I don’t

		agree tht. maintenance costs must rise in propn to capital

		expenditure.

	We had this discussion in autumn.  Thought we had disposed of it.

		Expld then diffies of charging in connn with hosp. treatment:

		because of existg. practice of deductg. fr. sickness benefit.

		Equivalency of a charge is already in force.  Also, in some

		cases it wd. be first time charge has ever bn. made for hospital

		treatment. e.g. Scotland and Royal Free Hospital.  10/= wd. give

		£10 m. – if charge imposed from first entry into hospital.  This

		wd. involve reviving almoners’ function.  My view is tht. 

		Assistce Bd. shd. do this – not almoners under M/H.  And that

		means another legislative alteration.  Nor do you know what 

		savings wd. result.  For Board’s criterion for other purposes are		pretty generous.

	Dentistry.  My need is for 12-20 insprs. to scrutinise claims.

		Ty. have refused to allow this.

	Spectacles.  Can reduce range of free frames.  Saves £1 m.

	Prescriptions.  Prefer to get economies by avoiding proprietary

		medicines &amp; to abandon charge.  Having admitted exceptions

		we are down the drain.

	Summing up.  Means legn.  Means abandong. principles of free Service		for sake of £42 m.  Depressing to our supporters &amp; to Socialists		throughout the world.  This is only piece of Socialist re-distribn		we have done.



P.M.	How do you honour ceiling?



A.B.	By miscell. adminve economies.

	Don’t abandon experiment after 1 full year’s working.  Let us at 

		least have 2 years.

	Nothing to this effect was said at Election.  Free service was one of

		our great achievements.



P.M.	What worries everyone:  constantly exceeding estimates:  no guarantee		we shan’t have another Suppl. Est. for 1950/51.



A.B.	I don’t think increase will continue.

	You must realise hospital costs are increasg.  You may say you can’t		afford it.  Change does no more than transfer part of cost to 

		patient.

	No estimate of benefits reaped in improved health.



E.Sh.	During election people told us it wasn’t a free Service.  Is it held now		to be imposs. ever to make a charge?



A.B.	Act says tht. anything medically necessary must be free.



P.M.	What of legn authorisg. 1/= charge for prescriptn.



H.McN.	I thought it better to examine what cd. be done.  For I accept R.S.C.’s		point tht. we must know where expre is going to.

	Believed Cab. thght. we cd. get revenue fr. charges esp. in hospitals.		I don’t think we cd. get anything like the money requd by that



		means.  In Scotland hospital service was free, for many 

		services.  Anyway how cd. you charge?  40% of our beds are

		occupied by lunatics &amp; m.d.’s.				  



A.B.	137.000 in E. &amp; Wales.



H.McN.	This = 50% of our hospital cost:  &amp; no change of recoverg. charge 

		from them.

	Must look elsewhere.  I believe you can’t cover £42 m. from recovery

		charges.  To tackle R.S.C.’s target you must cut back some 

		services.  e.g. dental &amp; eyes.  And if you don’t face this now you

		must soon.  For I believe expansion is inevitable:  certainly won’t 

		contract.  But given adequate hospital &amp; g.p. services we can 

		justify cutting back on some.

	Don’t see any chance of getting this sort of saving in 1950/51.

		Only 3 or 4% vice 10% saving wh. R.S.C. contemplates.

	Hence concln in my final para.



H.M.	Support R.S.C.   Thank H.McN. for trying to help R.S.C.

		But R.S.C. said last year “no Suppl. Est. save for changes of

		policy.”  I made a statement in Devaluation Debate, with authy

		of Cab., tht. further economies wd. be sought.



 R.S.C. &amp;	With Cab. authy?

A.B.



H.M.	Yes.



P.M.	Leave that out.



H.M.	Another statement recently made by R.S.C. tht. no Suppl. Est. wd. be

		put fwd. in 1950/51 for Health Service.  That must be honoured.

		And no comfort in A.B.’s memo.  Cabt. can’t accept posn tht. this

		expre shall be out of control.  Proposals involvg. expre shd. have

		authy of Cab. or Cab. Cttee.

	Political point.  If expre goes on increasg. what began as a popular

		scheme will be discredited.  A.B.’s case really is tht. he doesn’t

		want any check on this expre.

	We are trying to do too much too quickly – and priorities

		(e.g. children’s teeth) are suffering.

	Parly Labour Party is mature enough to face its responsibilities.

	Must do somethg. definite &amp; concrete.



		Discussion to be resumed at mtg. on followg. day.
