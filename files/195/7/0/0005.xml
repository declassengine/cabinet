C.M. 5(49)							20th January 1949



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter W.W.



W.W.	Business for next week.





		2.	Lynskey Tribunal Report.



C.E.	Don’t expect signed copy until Monday.  Vote Office as soon thereafter as may be.

	Aim at Tuesday pm. Wed. w’out fail.





		3.	Tied Cottages.



A.B.	Met repves of T.U.’s.

	Originally recommended no money for either class of tied cottage. Cab. decided to exclude only service cottages.  Put Cab. case strongly : but T.U.’s were immovable : or rather Agric workers were, tho’ T.G.W. Union assented.

	My concln. point out to agric. workers tht. if we tell farmers they can have grant if they grant tenancy, it will serve as lever to reduce no. of service cottages.

	Propose therefore to adhere to Cab. decision.



	Agreed.

							[Enter E.Sh.



		4.	Administration of Former Italian Colonies.



E.B.	Transfer to civil adminn. is overdue.  W.O. can’t handle it because occupying force bound by Hague Convention.



P.M.           x/	Diff. to defend putting some under C.O. and some under F.O.

	Also doubtful about putting adminve. responsibilities on F.O.



E.B.	I don’t want it.  But politically awkward in U.N. to put it under “C.O.”.



C.J.	F.O. experience in Sudan, Iraq, Palestine (?) suggested to us they were more appropriate.

	Paternalism in C.O. also.



E.B.	Must be semblance of independence.

	Will have to create a Dpt. in F.O. to deal with it.

C.J.	C.O. cd. help with staff.



E.Sh.	No diffy. over officials.

	Agree x/. can’t be m’tained for long.  For w. party to consider that.



R.S.C.	They shdn’t assume 2 parallel adminns.



E.Sh.	That isn’t the intention. We shd. want to transfer the lot if none escaped our supervision.



R.S.C.	b) Para. 2. Don’t limit w. party to self-contained entity.  Some of the common-service elements in F.O. cd. be used. This shd. not be excluded from w. party considn.



A.B.	Awkward tht. F.O. shd. be open to x-examn in  day-to-day adminn. 

	Will observe discn. of f. policy.



E.Sh.	Have got that posn. over Germany already.



E.B.	Exclusive – on Sudan model. Day-to-day adminn. not handled in F.O.

	That was original intention over Palestine. W.S.C. caused it to be thrown into C.O.  – hinc illae lacrimae.



P.M.	Phrasing is too exclusive.

	Limit it to “not being put under one of existing F.O. Branches”. Agreed.



J.	This discussion emphasises need for changing name of C.O. eg. to Dpt. for Overseas Territories. Name is only reason why we can’t put this responsibility in its proper place i.e. C.O. it is not really proper to F.O.



P.M.	Good case for a change of name.

	Wd. C.O. take it on, if name changed?



C.J.	This part of world is v. political. Awkward internationally because controversy. eg. degree of F.O. intervention in Palestine.



E.B.	Move in 2 stages.  First, transfer away fr. mil. adminn.  F.O. can take over temporarily.  Second, wider study of problem of handling overseas territories.



	Agreed:	1.	Approve in principle transfer of this 					responsibility to F.O. for time being. w. party to 			work out details.



			2.	G.O.C. to consider wider issues of responsibility 			for overseas territories (F.O., C.R.O. and C.O.)



								[Exit E.Sh.

								[Enter H.G., J.S. and B.

		5.	Economic Report.



R.S.C.	Man Power.

	Build up of undermanned not too bad.  Worst case is distribution.

	Cd. we discourage by cuts in distr. margins?

H.W.	Have done some – with little effect.

	Had thought ???? wd. throw up staff. They have kept them on in other services : accounting etc.



R.S.C.	Back to 85% of pre war only.  But rising rapidly.



E.B.	Is it economic to force consumers to go to shops and queue via delivery.



	Coal Production.

	O.m.s. changes not too bad. Attendance is problem. Worried over sickness absenteeism : 60.000 t. a week since July. Enquiry now procdg.



	Equipment not the cause – tho’ some sporadic shortages or delays.

	New pits : progress being made. N.C.B. report coming in with plan for whole country. Covering improved road-ways etc.



A.B.	Housing.

	No. under constn in E. and W. has fallen. Pressure from M.P.’s to increase p’mmes: adminve pressure by me to get l.a.’s to start p’mmes authorised.



	Reason: 1947 cuts superimposed on my action to reduce nos. started.

	Whole machine then became slack – at all stages fr. land acquisition.

	Takes 12 to 18 mos. to get these going in phase.

	Thus decns now will affect action in early 1950. If you want overt results showg. just before Genl. Election, you must take decns now.



	Misled about housing needs.  750.000 was quite inaccurate as target to give home for every family.  Warn Cab. I have now asked l.a.’s to give me informn for the purpose of constructg. a real estimate.



		Must now w’in Social Services p’mme, consider what we shd. do for 		housing during the 12 months before Genl. Election.  I want a decision 		on rate of 200.000 houses a year. No delay.



R.S.C.		On Economic Survey – in about 2 wks. time.



R.S.C.	Overseas Trade.



	Exports to Canada and U.S. is main diffy. Next year, 25% redn. in ERP dollars is likely.



A.	Complaints re. B. manufacturers quality or price.



H.W.	Due mainly to desire of Canadian buyers to get the U.S. market opened to them.  Campaign going on.  Want to go to Canada – to explain why we can’t buy more and to examine our marketing organn.



	12.7 to 19.7 increase in our exports to U.S.A. (W. Hemisphere).  But now running into buyers’ market.  Cars still doing well and cd. go better if we cd. get more steel. And market cd. be permanent for small cars because not big enough to warrant U.S. tooling up for it.



	Canada : report of Mission now under considn.  Suggest means by which we might double our engineering exports.



A.W.	Can. shipbuilders pleased tht. we have stopped buying timber. They can squeeze down prices.



H.W.	Not true. World price has fallen.



R.S.C.	Balance of Payments.

	Done well.  Because exceptional receipts in last 2 qurs.  But prospect of drop in dollar-earning of Colonies : cocoa prices and rubber are down.

	This emphasises point raised re increasing demand for gold. Apart from B. and Switz. trouble ahead over this with Persia and Egypt.

	

	Gold drain covered this year by E.R.P. But can’t rely on that.

	That raises ques. of prices. ? Trade turning seriously against us once more. Tendency of U.S. prices to fall hasn’t penetrated to goods we mainly buy.  Wheat, meat, butter, wool – all rising. And wool prices have risen so high that U.S. buyers are holding off.



	Wages.

G.A.I.	Rates are steady as cpd. Nov.

	Important moves reported in memo.

	Rlway claim going back to machinery in industry or on to Arbitn. Tribunal.

	No stoppage likely.



	Industrial Disputes.

	1.944.000 days lost – half million less than ’47 and lowest since ’43.

	P’ess in selling Works Cttees in industries opposed to them.



	Employment.

A.W.	20% increase in Scotland.



G.A.I.	As in developmt. areas. Businesses employing women.  Leaves men unempld. 



H.W.	Not ready now to let factories to firms employing less than 50% men.



	Controls.

R.S.C.	As in report.

	All Ministers shd. go on looking for ways of easing up.



H.W.	Paper largely de-controlled.

A.B.	Stress reason – increased prodn. not discovery of bureaucratic uselessness.

	Campaign on this?



R.S.C.	Not so easy.  Comparison with those existg. still isn’t striking.



A.W.	Risk of claiming too much credit, eg. for relaxn. of bldg. controls.

	Do relaxns. yield man power economy?



R.S.C.	“We watch that v. carefully” (!)



A.	We aren’t getting credit for a good story. Support A.B.



R.S.C.	Wait 2 months until we have a really good story.



H.W.	Hope to save 850 staff on what I’ve done.  But timber Control employs 1400.



	Man Power.

C.J.	Exhausted f. labour yet?



G.A.I.	Yes, for men.  Cd. use more women. But none in d.p. camps. Trying Germany.



H.W.	Belgian textile workers wd. be available.



G.A.I.	Getting them individually.

							[Exit H.G., J.S. and B.

								[Enter P. and Att.Gen.



		6.	Civil Aviation : Use of Mauritius by K.L.M.



P.M.	Expounded diffy. arising from India and Pakistan’s denying K.L.M. transit facilities because of irritation over Indonesia.



Att.G.	Two mistakes in my Minute. a) p. 2. Two Articles 68 and 89.

	b) Relied on Paris Convn. 1919 when posn was as I thought. Didn’t realise it had subsequently bn. amended and brght into line with Convn. Chicago.



	I hold view tht. we aren’t entitled to discriminate in favour of our own aircraft – save in war or natl. emergency.  Principle is same as freedom of seas and right of innocent passage.  Much to our interest tht. B. ships shd. be able to go anywhere. Don’t want to see that principle corroded. Believe it equally important in air as on sea.

	Believe that is effect of Conventn reading it as a whole.



N.B.	B. Emb. at Hague was actg. for I. and P. re visas.  Warned them they might have to stop. Now heard I. doesn’t mind – but prob. only for Civil Dutch travelling on other lines.  May indicate, however, some softening on part of I. and P.



P.M.	Propose, then, to act as proposed. Informing I. and P.  In effect, allow K.L.M. to land so long as undertakg. given about not carrying mil. stores.



	Approved.				[Exit P. and Att. Gen.





		7.	Leakages of Information.



P.M.	Journalists overhead 2 Ministers talking in H/C. about Palestine discn. 

	Luckily newspaper reported to me for guidance and was good enough to publish.



A.B.	Per contra.  Press said Cab. was unanimous behind E.B.
