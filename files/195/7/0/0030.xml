C.M. 34(49)							12th May 1949



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter W.W.



H.M.		Business for next week. 



A. 		Business in H/Lds.





		2.	Parliament Bill.



H.M.	Dates.  But A. and I are disposed to give 2nd Rdg. in H/C. soon after Whitsun.



W.W.	Early July.



P.M.	Keep it : pop it in when required.



H.M.	Want to give H/L. a warning tht. we are going on with it.





		3.	Ireland Bill.



C.E.	Civil Guard have infd N.S.Yd tht. 50% cut made in funds for watchg, illegal drilling etc. and given hint not to be over zealous.

	Dublin Govt. won’t therefore discourage recrudescence of violence (in Ulster: prs. U.K.)

	Disposn being taken here.  Some Ministers may need protn.



H.M.	17 Labour supporters deliberately abstained in Divn.

	Mainly on R.C. basis for this.



A.W.	Will N.S.Yd communicate with Glasgow?  



C.E. 	Yes.



H.M.	Cab. decided N.I. wd. be defended as any other part of U.K.  Didn’t volunteer this y’day because ques. not raised.  Shd. we see tht. ques. is asked on 3rd Rdg.



N.B.	C.E.’s statement fits with McBride’s statement tht. wdn’t have another civil war.  Thought this was a threat.



P.M.	Don’t engineer a ques. as suggd. by H.M.



E.B.	Dulanty said to me, v. Atlantic Pact, that this whole policy came fr. Cork where I.R.A. members promised Costello they wd. disband if this policy adopted.  May be cut in funds means they are getting to trust I.R.A.



A.B.	Condns of electns in N.I. casts doubt on repve characters of N.I. Parlt.

	Cd. we consider this point after Bill is thro’.

	Otherwise, Clause means we are conniving at gerrymandering.



P.M.	Both sides cheat on elections.



H.M.	Not our business – don’t burn our fingers.



	Agreed : p’pone discns of this.





		4.	 Berlin Blockade.



E.B.	Blockade lifted.  But R. insistg. rlway engines be changed on frontier – whereas previously same ones went right thro’.

	Mention this because it may be treated as a matter of principle.

	Told Robertson to protest.  Can’t give way on this before C.F.M. mtg.





		5.	Indonesia.



E.B.	‘Jocarta’ agreemt. thro’. Confce at Hague will be held.

	Nehru has said tht. when confce held he will restore dipl. relns and lift ban on Dutch air lines.  This is good.

	Bijl has resigned. Must prop up Dutch Govt. until confce is over.





		6.	Local Government.				

								[Exit W.W.

								[Enter L.S. and D.J.

A.B.	Complicated ques. – made worse by timing.

	i)  Don’t want legn before Genl. Election.  That rules out L.S. memo. at outset.  Putting B. Commn in posn to deal with London wd. involve legn [or at least] and 1st class Parly. row before Election.

	Thought it was common ground we didn’t want legn before Election.



	ii)  R. Commn exists and reports.  Another due soon.  We shall be asked wthr. we intend to implement.



	iii)  B. Commn creates more problems than it solves – by reason of  duties imposed on it by statute.  They themselves think they shd. do more or less.



	iv)  Their order if made won’t become effective until 1950 or 52.  Then will have to be undone.



	Want therefore a means of puttg. Commn out of business.  Hence R. Commn.

	Profound diffence of opinion in l.g. circles re functions and purposes of l.a.’s suspect same diffces wd. be disclosed w’in Cab. – if H.M.’s plan were adopted.

	We are concerned, not with facts, but genl. principles – what l. govt. shd. do.

	Intend cpl. enquiry wd. get us at loggerheads.

	Worse, we shd. have to say we were considg. it – as reason for not implementg. B. Commn repts.  That wd. start controversy w’in Party at moment when we desire unity.

	M/H. have concluded ques. isn’t urgent.  Thought R. Commn cd. complete in time for legn in 3rd quarter of next Parlt.  That wd. be hurried.  Now believe however l. govt. is doing its stuff well enough. No special urgency.  Expandg. boros. (eg B’stol and S’oton) are now acquiring bldg. sites outside own area.  Legn. cd. therefore wait after next Parliament.

	Recommended therefore R. Commn. : put B. Commn. into cold storage : cd. have offl. Cttee. to draw up t. of r. : play it all slow, get Rpt. at time wh. won’t embarrass 1953 Election.

	Official Cttee.  What authority wd. it have?  Rpt. wdn’t overbeat hostile l.a. opinion.

	“R Commn won’t agree”.  Wd. give Govt. mandate to impose its solution.

	If it were unanimous, wd. give us authority.



P.M.	This is in fact plan for putting whole thing to sleep for many years.

	Only p’pones diffies.  Rpt. when it arrives, will confront same diffies in  Govt.

	Real ques : do we intend to try to deal with this ques. or turn aside fr. it.

	We have all facts. J.’s report.  More experience of l. govt. in this Cab. than in any other.



H.M.	Agree with P.M.

	A.B. has got wrong idea of interdepl. Cttee.  I want Govt. to discuss principles of l. govt.  We haven’t done so.



	A.B.  wants to turn aside from the whole problem – and chance what comes out of R. Commn.  I want Ministers to discuss and make up their

                   x/	minds – after examn. by Dpt. officials who wd. report to Ministers.



A.B.	What wd. we do with next B. Commn report?

	I favour official examinn as at x/.



H.M.	Agree tht. major legn on L. Govt is out of ques. this Parlt.

	Don’t see same diffy. over legn to amend powers of B. Commn.  Cdn’t evade debate anyway.  Wdn’t mind debate.

	B. Commn is competent.  Produced ingenious rept.  Pity to put them out of action : for urgent ques. is adjustment of county districts.

	Agree you cd. make a case for leavg. legn until Parlt. after next.  But better the next Parlt.  But we shd. clear our minds m’while.

	No confidence tht. R. Commn wd. help us to clear our minds.

	A.B.’s plan : too obviously side stepping and doesn’t work.



P.M.	Can use R. Commn for delay or for examn.  But if Govt. is to act it shd. have a policy.  Inclined to favour Ministers getting a policy.  Before any cttee. or Commn. gets into detail.



A.B.	I and my Dpt. are too busy to think of this ques.



P.M.	Many broad principles which many of us have bn. thinking about for years.  Can’t we see how far we agree.



H.M.	Offls. can sort out facts and put up alternatives.  Ministers won’t be troubled m’while.



A.B.	I have definite views : and don’t want to put them on paper now for fear of stirring up l. govt. circles.



L.S.	One issue. Can’t re-organn of l. govt. wait?  Even that needs investign.

	My Dpt. thinks it can’t.  Delay is inhibiting planning and distorting development.  E.g. Manchr : can’t build save in Cheshire and county dislike and mayn’t provide services.  Manchr might have to take powers to provide services themselves.

	I don’t think it can wait beyond early part of next Parlt.

	Ldn. a special problem : must be dealt with separately.  All 144

	authies can’t carry out Gter. Ldn. Plan.

	As M/H. dissents on both these last points, shdn’t we discuss them betwn. officials and Ministers.



G.T.	All our diffies arisen fr. B. Commn.  They shd. never have bn. given power to consider functions.



	London problem is not so v. difft. from Lancs.

	Facts compelled action (on overspill) before there was a M/T.C.P.

	In Lancs. my Party is split from top to bottom over recommns of B. Commn.

	Favour R. Commn because need authoritative report.  B. Commn., wthr. right or wrong, isn’t sufficiently authoritative.



	I might aim “all purpose” authority man and will fight for tht.



A.B.	How cd. you allow B. Commn to consider Ldn. while we were examing. general ques?



H.M.	Don’t see much diffy.  Ldn. has always bn. considered separately.

	But don’t press suggn. tht. B. Communn shd. consider Ldn.

	Am more concerned tht. offls. and Ministers shd. discuss general ques.



C.E.	We face new circs. wh. cdn’t have bn. foreseen when B. Commn set up.

	All trading services have now bn. taken fr. l.a.’s.

	Creates new situation.  And removed interest – l.g. on part of many.

	Other services modified – moved upward in l.a. hierarchy.

	B. Commn therefore abandoned boundary ques. turned to functions.

	Shd. be made clear tht. this = Governmental function not theirs.

	Favour P.M.’s view.  Must now be matter of high policy for Ministers. Try to get genl. principles and ask offls. to fill them out.

	Don’t assume next Parlt. will run for 5 years.  May get a series of shorter Parlts.



A.B.	How can I then put B. Commn out of action.



L.S.	Let Min. Cttee. consider that ques. also.     



A.B.   	Agree.



	Agreed : Ministerial Cttee.  P.M. in chair.

							[Exit A.B.



		7.	New Town Corporations : Remuneration of Members.



LS.	As in memo.



	Manchr. is an exceptn.  Elsewhere l.a. people wdn’t be competent to do this.



A.W.	If we had started unpaid we might have got the chaps – cdn’t have got all the professional types.  Difft. fr. running on existing town.  Have bn. able in Scotland to get Chairman and Vice Chairman unpaid, and some members.  But do we want to limit membership to those who can work unpaid.

	Reducing salaries. Don’t confine it to New Towns.  Extend it, if at all, to members of Bds.



D.J.	Support T.C.P.  If you are spending all this money on the towns you had better spend a little on getting good men to run them.



H.M.	This work is comparable to big. Co. Council Housing Cttee. work.

	L. Govt people : hospital Bd. people are doing work as important.



N.B.	Need this to get towns built. If Ty. doesn’t oppose, go on paying.



G.T.	L.a. members are doing as valuable work.  Not satisfied  we shd. pay members.



A.	Support M/Ed.

	Mistake to pay members.

	May destroy best elements of l.a. spirit.  Obnoxious slippery slope.



T.W.	Opposite view.  True l.a. members do much work.  But here there is responsibility for bldg. a new and expensive thing.  Chairman shdn’t be left to do this work on his own.



E.B.	Apart fr. general review of all Board salaries (wh. I shd. like to see) I wdn’t pick on this.  Favour course (a).



C.E.	Favour (a).



P.M.  	Leave this as now.



	Agreed.   But consider wthr. new corpns are needed (cd. l.a. do it) and if so wthr. members shd. be paid.



	Salaries of Vice Chairman.



	Vice has responsibilities on Sub Cttee. than working party assumed.



	Agreed :	£750 for vice chairman.

			

							[Exit L.S.

		8.	Meat Ration.				[Enter J.S. &amp; Bottley.



		Memo. approved.
