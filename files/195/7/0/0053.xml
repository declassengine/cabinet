C.M. 59 (49)					18th October, 1949



1.	     Economic Situation.



P.M.	Statement foreshadowed in last debate.  Proposed to make it Monday. Propose P. Notice Ques. to-day. – blanket Platts-Mills ques. on Paper.

		May be suitable if I make the statement.



			Agreed.



P.M.	Shd. not have debate on Monday.  L.P. shd. offer to arrange day thro’ Whips.



R.S.C.	Much of it cd. be debated on Profits Tax resoln – which will come first.



H.M.	Let debate go wide &amp; take resoln on the nod.  Will tell Chief Whip.

	Opposn might press for immediate debate on Adjournment.  But on merits I wd. prefer following week e.g. Thursday.  Hope P.M. might b’cast in interval.



P.M.	Agree -  non-controversial b’cast on what citizen has to do to help.





2.	     Parliament.



A.B.	Friday.  Nurses Bill 2nd Rdg.  2nd Order.  Will this be taken however late?

		Many people will want to speak.



H.M.	Put this point to Chief Whip.





3.	     Devaluation of Sterling.



R.S.C.	P.Q.  Did we consult Belg. &amp; France before announcing devaluation.

	Awkward to find formula wh. they won’t contradict.  Read one out.

	Factually correct.  “Approaches were made…..”



E.B.	V. awkward.  Don’t want to put Petch into diffies.



R.S.C.	F.O. want me to say we “consulted”.  I can’t say that:  wasn’t true.

		Wd. get me into diffies with other Govts.





4.	     Countries of Service in Essential Industries.



			                                                          [Enter H.G. S-Genl., B.



G.A.I.	Can’t stop this in advance.  Can’t deal on mass basis afterwards.

		Only hope is to proceed r. ringleader, when that is possible.

		And get it home to men tht. they shd. use conciliating machinery.



P.M.	What advantage in overhaulg. contracts – para 8.



G.A.I.	Not in favour of trying this.



H.G.	Agree.



B.	Refce to Dock Workers Scheme.  Don’t agree tht. this is working satisfy.

		Being looked into, by W. party of M/T. &amp; M/L.



G.A.I.	I accept that.



			Memo. approved.

			                                                         [Exit above

			                                                         [Enter H. Marqu. &amp; J.G.

			                                                          

5.	     Use of National Health Service by Aliens.



A.B.	No ques. of law.  ….. (out of room for a time)….



J.G.	Reciprocity.  Want to go ahead on narrow specific points – wide genl. talks get us nowhere.  Want to go ahead with present agreement.



A.B.	I agree.



A.W.	Many foreigners come to Edinburgh for special operations.  And pre-schemes, he got it free in R. Infirmary under their charter.  Can’t give worse treatment under N.H. Scheme.

	But there are abuses.  e.g. patients coming fr. Jersey to Guys.

	In 1st year 1.860 foreigners consulted g.p.s – small no cpd. with f. visitors to Edinburgh Festival.  That costs nthg.  In drugs, prob, under £500.

		Dentists:  34 in July (incldg. 3 B. subjects on leave &amp; 10 f. seamen).  Cost £106.  Spot check.  Only one denture.  July:  17 sight-tests £12.  no specs. provided.  Hospitals: 150 in the year.

	Not therefore a serious problem qua size.  Adminve complicns of dealing with it.

		Believe it will die away.

	Wtr. we shd. advertise it to visitors is another ques.



H.M.	This was important policy point because of political controversy.  Yet attentn was not drawn to it, in advance, in Cabinet.  Or Legn Cttee on the Bill.

	Applicants cd. have bn. made to sign decln tht. they are B. subjects.

	Even if service is to be available to foreigners: they might become a traffic in this &amp; we shd. then have to deal with it.  Must watch it.

	My main complaint is tht. issues of policy with political implications were not brought up for discn with colleagues in Cab or Cttees.

	Look at the leaflet.



A.B.	This isn’t addressed to foreigners – it’s to all populn.



H.M.	Why throw it at aliens when they got identity cards. (para. 3 of 206)

		Why include x/ on front page of leaflet.

	Why push these facilities at foreigners.

	Do we need to go on distributing these to foreigners?



H.H.M.	All appliances etc., supplied by M/P.

	Limbs, eyes &amp; tricycles [sic] only do we deal direct with patients.

	8 cases – of which 6 wd. be controversial politically.

	Greatest risk of abuse is fr. Eire – increased visitors to Belfast.

		We have means of checkg. abuse.  We did stop one Dane from getting artificial leg for nothing.



A.B.	Less humane than mediaeval practice.



J.	Law requires us to provide the facilities for anyone who is here.

		H.O. cd. impose condn or refuse leave to land.  But once landed they are entitled to the facilities.



A.B.	On point about Cab. Cttee etc., agree tht. ques. of pol. controversy shd. come fwd. but it’s Minister’s discretion to decide what is likely to prove controversial.  Had I known this wd. be so controversial I wd. have omitted x/ from leaflet.

	Am prepd to consider amendg. legn, to enable me to discriminate against non-residents.



R.S.C.	That is the way to do it.  Take power to discriminate – power to make a charge on non-residents.



A.B.	Might put it in current Bill.



			Agreed.  1)  M/H. to consider amendg. legn.

2)	M/N.I. to go on with current agreement.



			                                                            [Exit J.G. and H.H.M.



6.	     Political Activities of Civil Servants.



R.S.C.	Have reconsidered – in light of Cab’s views.

	V. awkward in light of answer given to P.Q.  with Cab. authority.

	Read out formula which he proposed to use.

		Gives freedom to the 450.000.  Preserves status quo for the rest until after General Election.



P.M.	Why drag in General Election?

G.A.I.	May dispose C. Servants to press candidates to pledge themselves.



R.S.C.	Can say “next local elections” if you wish.



H.M.     x/	Say “until end of 1950.”



			Agreed.



			General formula approved subject to x/.



H.D.	M’man recommn on G.P.O. – need that to be taken anyway.



R.S.C.	Mustn’t make exceptions in advance of conclns on whole report.



A.V.A.	Can we proceed with repeal of 1939 Act?



P.M.	Yes – at end of present Parliament.





7.	     N.W. Atlantic Fisheries Convention.



			Memo. approved.
