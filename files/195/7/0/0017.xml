A.	Debate on Air y’day. We gave no satisfn.



P.M.	Shouldn’t anticipate H/C. debates.			[Exit W.W.





		2.	India.



P.M.	General statement on lines of brief.

		10 Point and 8 Point memoranda – discn with A., N.Z. and Canada – 		associate membership rejected by India – thus faced with India’s desire 		to remain in Comm. tho’ unwilling to accept any substantial link with 		Crown. 



	Time factor because Indian constitution to be adopted in July : decision by Comm. Govts. required by then.  Issue : can Comm. include a republic or must India go out if she can’t accept Crown connection. U.K. can’t decide alone : a matter for all members.



	C.R. Cttee discns.  Factual statements prepared on pros. and cons. – esp. the implications memo.  These show advantages are in favour of retaing. India in Comm.  Ques: how can it be done? M.f.u. diffies – not yet challenged over Eire. but more probably wd. over India.  Not immutable  intern. law must take a/c of modern developmts. twds. grouping.  But diff. to find common link other than Crown.  Citizenship is a bit thin.



	Historical continuity.  Declns involving common act of will.

	Other groupings eg. in S. America – might have to put up with that.

	Republic. Goes beyond India.  May create republican tendencies elsewhere.

	Eg. S. Africa.  Might lead to large shrinking of H.M. sovereignty.

	But if you insist on Crown, you make it a hindrance to developmt. rather than a bond.

	V. important to keep I. in if poss.  That is view of older Doms – save prs. S. Africa (because their diffies with India) and prs. of new Doms. also.

	Diff. year because of elections – in Can., Austr., and N.Z. all before autumn. But can’t handle by corrce. 



	Want other Govts. to have chance of full considn. in advance of mtg.

	Proposing to send emissaries : to give facts and background.  This means P.M.’s will arrive after discn. with Govts.

	No U.K. decision in advance.  But basis of emissaries talk will be in favour of keeping India in.



	Indicns of Comm. turning heat on v. S.E.A.  Opening up against India now.  We want to build up a W. Union bastion in S.E.A.

	Mtg. now in Dublin on Burma situation.

	Don’t believe India will accept substantial link with Crown – tho’ there is strong loyalist feeling there.



	Have discussed with King.  Wd. not be averse to considg. republic w’in Comm.  Danger of King becoming controversy in Dom. politics.

	Saw Opposn in confidence y’day.

	Indians proud of their British institutions.  English is their only common language.  Commn. makes headway in Asia where it can ally itself with nationalism.

							                        [Exit T.W.



N.B.	Older Doms. agree on importce of keeping India in.

	Private advice fr. India is tht. N. and Patel are increasingly anxious to stay in and under pressure to resist Communists.

	If Tories had brought Crown into politics, Menzies and Drew wd. have followed suit.



H.M.	Diff. from Eire because India wants to stay in.

	Don’t like break with Crown – even a mention wd. help.

	But if it comes to the point, insistence on Crown link shdn’t prevent India’s assocn. continuing.

	S. Africa – might face us with republican issue some day, in any event.

	Any arrangemt. must be reciprocal – a two way declaration.



A.	Endorsed P.M.’s views.

	Still not beyond hope tht. we may get some link thro’ Crown.  Even tenuous links have some value.

	But in last resort worth keeping I. in even as a republic.



C.E.	Endorse H.M.’s views.

							                    [Exit C.E.



A.B.	Support A’s view.  Even tenuous links with Crown shd. be accepted.

	If assocn is weakening, symbols become more pliable.

	If assocn is strengthening symbols become more and more meaningful.



	If therefore you believe India will want closer association, even a bridge of words on which they could cross wd. be valuable.

	Can the implications document be circulated to Cabinet. 



P.M. 	Yes.



A.W.	Privy Council as a link may be valuable: Judicial Committee.



H.M.	Some Doms. are in course of rejecting it.



P.M.	A good link – pity some Doms. have rejected it.

	And idea tht. President of India shd. be member of  Privy Council.



G.T.	The Indian politicians (like others) are victims of own propaganda.

	Leave them a way back into full association.



A.V.A.	Importce of retaining India from strategic point of view.

	eg. Regional defence schemes.  Pakistan, as member, pressing me for priority in military assistance.  Much advantage in keeping both in.



H.W.	Economic implications.  V. serious if India goes out.

	And Crown link is v. material on m.f.u. basis.

	Even a tenuous link wd. be better than none.



E.B.	When do we tell U.S. – and how?

	Can we not get them eg. to abstain from taking the m.f.u. point? Eg. by getting U.S. to see tht. it’s essential for India to keep w’in Comm. and making a declaration to that effect at the appropriate moment.
