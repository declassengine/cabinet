C.M. 6(50).				2nd March, 1950.



	1.	Cabinet.		[Enter  W.W.



P.M.	Welcomed new members.





	2.	Private Members’ Time.



H.M.	Take all until Easter – inevitable.

	Ques:  what thereafter?  Shd. like to say we will consult Opposn with

		view to seekg. agreement.

	Don’t like havg. to refuse time for debates e.g. on natd indies.  Better

		use of time than Private Members.

	If we have to give time, I wd. sooner see Motions than Bills.

	Ask for discretion – to meet genl. wishes of H/C.



A.B.	Support Motions.



T.W.	Same.



H.D.	Yes:  wd. give Ministers one free day a week.  V. important fr. that

		angle.

			Agreed – as proposed by H.M.





	3.	Parliament.



H.M.	Bulk of House will be sworn by Friday p.m.

	Mon:  State opening.  Formal speeches on Address.



R.S.C.	Shd. Nat. Liberals be allowed to speak as sep. Party.



W.W.	We don’t recognise them as such, in “usual channels”.



H.M.	Tues.  Motion to take Pr. Members’ Time before Easter.

	Debate on Address to conclude on Mon. week.

	May P.M. &amp; I settle Govt. spkers?	Agreed.

	Thereafter we follow with Supply.



P.M.	Engagemts. for visit of Fr. President next week.  Can’t avoid being

		absent.  Can we avoid Divns. wile Aurios is here?  Take

		Opposn amendment on Monday.

			Agreed:  Ch. Whip.



				[Enter  G.S.

	4.	Iron &amp; Steel Act.



G.S.	Sittg. pretty.  Nor need for any further Parly. action.

	Corpn can’t be set up until Oct.  Needn’t for a year after that.

	We sit back &amp; do nothg.

	Only change:  shadow organn will not (as I had privately 

		contemplated) be set up soon.

	Public answer:  “Corpn can’t be apptd until 1/10 &amp; in due time

		members will be appointed..”



H.M.	P.M. cd. say “This is taking its course:  no action until 1/10”

	Is industry going on well?



G.S.	They had decided to co-operate if full Labour majority.  Now they

		won’t.



A.B.	What will our supporters think?  I wd. favour saying in K. Speech

		tht. we intend to proceed at once to implement Act.

	Minister shd. seek co-opn where he can get it.  And we shd. decide

		so to prepare that Bd. can be apptd on 1/10.

	As soon as Election was over we became free (Annex) to approach

		individuals re membership of Bd.

	If any ambiguity in P.M.’s statemt., Oppn will table amendmt. tht.

		nothg. be done until after next Election.  That will finish us as

		Parly Party.  Favour playing here from strength.  Otherwise

		authy of Whips will be undermined.  100% attendance of our

		supporters can only be secured by offensive spirit.



E.B.	Dissent. – on tactics.

	On Steel:  my prefce is “Act is on statute book:  dates are fixed:

		we adhere to our purpose.”  No need to say wtr. or no we 

		shall approach individuals.

	This is Act of Parlt., passed by H/L. not despite them.



P.M.	Favour realist view.  All know we can’t put it into opn now.

		Our policy stands.

		We propose to carry out Act of Parlt.



H.D.	Agree with that.

	Mustn’t sound retreat.

	Let people guess there will be another Election before 1/10.  But

		don’t appear to be shrinking from this.

	All steel centres supported us.  In other areas, don’t believe steel

		was an issue.



R.S.C.	Say shortly:  law is on Statute book &amp; we intend to carry it out.

		Take the initiative.



A.	Support that.  But recognise fact, here, that Minister won’t get a 

		good Corpn in present circumstances.

			Agreed:  as put by E.B.

					[Exit  G.S.





	5.	King’s Speech.



P.M.	Custom for P.M. to read to other Ministers day before.

	Friday is too early.  Don’t do it on this occasion.

			Agreed:  so inform Ministers (No. 10).

			               copies to opposition etc., on Sunday.

					[Exit  W.W.



P.M.	Par. 15.  Limited time as well as Parly Situation (small majority).



H.M.	K. Sp. Cttee took the view tht. we were not going forward with p’mme

		in Election Manifesto.  You will be asked.  Better take initiative

		&amp; make it clear at once.



G.W.	Use “major” in first half.



A.B.	Water Bill cd. be ready by early May.  Wd. be major legn.  Diff. for

		Tories to oppose it.



P.M.	Desirable:  but acute controversy with our supporters in 

		municipalities e.g. Sheffield.  “Now your water will cost you

		more.”



A.B.	Even the Times consider this Bill to be non-controversial.



A.	Say if poss. somethg. about water supplies in para. 16.

			M/H. to go on with prepn of Bill.   Agreed.

			Don’t rush consultns with outside interests – H.M.



A.B.	What mood do we want to induce in supporters?

	List of Bills is v. dull.

	What about Lease-hold reform?  “residential &amp; business premises.”



P.M.	It isn’t ready.

	What country is lookg. for is better adminn, not fancy legislation.



J.G.	Some reference.  “After receipt of rept. hope to be able to introduce

		legn.	                                  

			                                          Agreed.   J. to settle language.



J.	They may report in April – or, more likely, June.



C.E.	Maintenance Orders.  I was heckled on this durg. Election.  Does

		cause hardship.  Warrants mention in Speech.



R.S.C.	Diff. to express clearly in a few words.



C.E.	Read a draft.

		General view:  doesn’t sound good.



T.W.	Fish.  Don’t want this as the only reference to fish.



E.Sh.	Won’t be regarded as derisory by trawler hands.



C.E.	Leave it in.	Agreed:  leave this in.



H.M.	Consumers’ Advice Centre.  Can we mention it?



H.W.	We aren’t ready.



P.M.	Not a starter.



           	Back to Para. 15.



A.	Agreed last year tht. this Session wd. be thin.  But dishonest not to

		refer to results of Election.



J.G.	Phrase in draft wd. be taken as implying early Election.



H.M.	Even if this Parlt. lasts for 2 Sessions, are you going on with major

		natn projects?  Apart fr. water.  Wd. be political madness.



A.B.	That must be kept an open question.



P.M.	We took a line on Saty.

	Does anyone suppose we cd. put thro’ major legn?



R.S.C.	Prs. unwise to say “parly sitn” in K.’s Speech – risk of

		misunderstandg. abroad.

	Let P.M. deal with it, in Debate.



P.M.	What do I say then?  Certainly not in this Session shall we proceed

		with sugar etc.  For future Sessions I need say nothg. &amp; am not

		going to.



R.S.C.	You cd. add tht. you recognise diffies &amp; limitns of small majority.



A.B.	Indicated dissent.



H.M.	Beware of being accused on dishonesty.  We know we aren’t going

		on with Labour policy.  Country wants to know.  What harm in

		telling them?  Reservg. right to do essential things in natl interest.



J &amp; A.	Strongly supported H.M.

	Not necessarily in Speech, but by P.M. on same day.  Can’t delay it.



P.M.	Must work w’in condns as we find them.  There are limits to what a

		Govt. can do.



E.Sh.	Why try to put heads in sand?  Of course there’s a Parly situation.

		No harm in admittg. it.  Shd. be said either in K. Sp. or by 

		P.M.



R.S.C.	Our mandate is to carry on our Adminn (planned economy etc.)

		but not to embark on fresh natn projects.





	6.	Defence White Paper.



G.A.I.	Para. 25.  “is being” set up.	Agreed.



E.Sh.	H.O. para. on Civil Defence.  Can accept.



R.S.C.	P. 5. top para.  Implies only reason:  air-lift to Berlin.  That is wrong.



		Agreed.



	Concln.  Too late to look back to war.



G.W.	Cdn’t 34 be omitted?



E.Sh.	I will consider.



A.B.	Consider para. 7.



P.M.	No need.



H. McN.	Para. 5. of ex-enemy countries or by name.	Agreed.



G.T.	Para. 27.  Can student be called up before 18.6.?



E.Sh.	Can be done.



E.B.	Want emphasis changed on Prodn Council – not makg. enough of

		our prodn for allies.



H.W.	Para. 33. end.  Reflectn on U.S. methods.



			Agreed:  subject to points noted above.

			               M/D. to revise accordingly.
