2) need to determine w’in 6 mos. of developmt. plan tht. denom. Authies have funds to meet commitments. 

Churches contend this is imposs. - &amp; somethg. in contentn.  I haven’t insisted on ability if willingness shown.  But if they yield to me they prejudge ultimate ease.

		Am trying to make deal on that basis for all denominns.  But if R.A.B. proposed amendmt. providg. for transitional posn I will promise consn.  Will submit memo. for Cab. next week.

			Agreed.





4.	    Dock Strike.

					        [Enter Att. G.

G.A.I.	No change in no. striking.



C.E.	D. Labour Bd. mtg. on dismissal.  2 sides not in agreemt.  Likely to be left to casting vote of Ammon, who wd. vote for dismissal.  Ldn. Bd. asked for Govt. views:

		Ministers said cd. say nil because earlier Cab. view.  Now want to know what advice we shd. give.



G.A.I.	Tried to ascertain Deakin’s view.  He fears Ammon wd. say “sack the lot.”  He will instruct his repves not to agree to anythg. w’out consultg. Executive of Union.

	E.B. has seen Deakin – who is confident of outcome.



A.B.	We shd. prevent this fr. going to Natl. Bd.  Wd. give comms. a fresh pt. of departure.



G.A.I.	Believe men are lookg. for chance to go back.  Try to get Bd. to hold back troops on Fri. a.m. to see wtr. men turned up:  &amp; regard those who don’t as havg. resigned fr. scheme.  Try this now or next week.  Or get T.U. to suggest it.



C.E.	Friday is too soon.  Also leaders mght. impose “condns”.  Any plan like above shd. come formally from Deakin.



R.S.C.	Let Bd. say they hope tht. enough men will work on Mon. to avoid havg. to use troops.  Then if men come at 8.a.m. don’t put troops in.



C.E.	I want to get T.G.W.U. back into posn of responsibility.



R.S.C.	They cd. follow up statement by Bd.



G.A.I.	Bd. must add some penalty for those who don’t turn up on Monday:  e.g. deprival of benefits of scheme.



A.B.	No:  that wd. be psych. mistake.



				 

				[Enter Barnes

B.	Keep out Nat. Bd. &amp; build up- troops.                                J. Str.



C.E.	Then what advice to Ldn. Bd.?



R.S.C.	Say it’s untimely.



G.A.I.	That wd. suffice.

			                                                        [Exit B. &amp; J.S.

			                                                        [Enter K.Y., &amp; Wheatley

5.	    Visiting Forces Act.

	Dealt with points raised in priv. discussions.

			Memo. approved.





6.	    Arab States and Israel.



P.M.	M/State is announcg. to-day.

			Agreed.



		       	                                                  [Exit Att.G., K.Y., Wheatley

		                                                           [Enter H.G.

7.	    Meals in Restaurant.



M.W.	As in memo.  



R.S.C.	Prodn Cttee always in favour, save for psych. re-action.

		That is only ques.  And I now believe it is no longer serious.



H.W.	This is now largest obstacle to U.S. tourist trade.  They think the addns are a racket.  Announcemt. cd. be related to tourist traffic, but not to U.S. pressure.



H.D.	Is this a good moment?  Wage claims, Budget etc.  If it is done, stress para. 12(a).  Genl. view:   people who eat out are privileged = they will say this is more privilege for them.



J.	As Chairman of T. Assocn I confirm H.W.’s statement.



A.B.	Time when this can go.  Create grayness rather than justice.  



H.M.	Support.  Careful publicity.  Promise review in autumn.



C.E.	Will be unpopular on N/E coast.



J.G.	Danger:  publicity for expensive parties.



H.McN.	Cd. T.U.’s be associated with announcemt.



A.B.	No trumpet flourishing.



R.S.C.	Announce by letter to B. Hols. &amp; Tourist Assocn.

		Then you can say in H/C that you have done it.  Justifn:  tourist trade + efflux of time has made it less effective.



		                                                                  [Exit M.W.

			                                                         [Enter B., N.B., G.S., P.

8.	    Socialised Industries.



H.M.	Better public relations.  Followed by long statement covering whole ground.

	In light of re-statement (esp. as I don’t press common efficiency unit as only method of checkg. efficiency) hope Cab. will authorise me to make a fresh approach to Chairman of boards.



P.M.	Favour such an approach.  But a)  don’t talk of efficiency unit.

	b)  what is relation betwn. this &amp; staff of socialisg. Ministers.  He is respons. to Parlt.   Shdn’t he have the efficiency checks.  Thgt Minister’s staff wd. change into small body of expert advisers.



N.B.	I have staff who know industries &amp; are in close touch with Bds.  I believe Dpt. is efficient for its purpose. 



P.M.	What kind of staff?



N.B.	Includes economist, scientific staff etc. 



H.G.	Almost all civil servants.

	But happen to have close knowledge of the industries.  N.C.B. think well of them &amp; try to get them away.  This is specially true of coal.  Electricity has never bn. closely controlled:  but Under Secy. i/c. happens to be v. good.

		They are critical of boards.



P.M.	But they don’t ques. comparative view wh. industrial consultant can give.



H.W.	Much to be done by Minister &amp; his Dpl. Staff.  Judging by results, they can put ques. to Minister &amp; to boards.  Experienced administrator.  Stat. branch wh. raises pertinent ques.

	But this staff can’t do the job of industrial consultants – esp. going in to the factory or mine.



A.V.A	Either Bds. are capable or they aren’t.  They will split up respon. functionally.

		They will call in consultants if they think that necessary.

	We don’t know what efficiency checks they have adopted.  Doubtful if, w’out that knowledge, we shd. say what more they shd. do.



H.G.	What are the consultants to do?

			a)  If technical processes, it’s w’in the mine etc.,

		And there is little comparable betwn. various techn. processes of socd indies.

		Can ask wtr. outsiders cd. help.  But not a commons unit.

	Other ques:  b) is the structure of industry right?  What experts can help on that?



H.M.	I wd. agree that is mainly for Ministers &amp; boards.



H.G.	On N.C.B. organn we had an outside rpt. (Burrows’ Rpt); and it was rotten.

	Remains c) O &amp; M. work.  Scope for that.  And prs. a common unit wd. do.

	P.M.’s letter askg. for economy of staff.  I saw Bds.  They were co-operative.

	Possibilities of a common unit are v. limited.



N.B.	Agree tht. (b) shd. be for Ministers &amp; boards.  On (a) much is already being done &amp; consultants are being used.  On (c) most boards have own O &amp; M. organn.

	Before approachg. Chairman again, I think Ministers shd. know more of what is being done.  Have had replies to P.M.’s lr. – impressive.  I also think we shd. put down clearly what proposals we have to make.



R.S.C.	Real problem is:  can we devise some checks wh. will avoid Select Cttee?

		Want somethg. to convince Parlt. they needn’t evolve mechanism for enquiring into workg. of Bds.  Mere statement tht. boards are workg. well won’t be enough.



A.B.	Thought we had decided last time to ask Ministers to put in pp. showg.

                        x|	what internal checks there are.  But there wd. still remain the second ques. in wh. L.P. is interested.  Believe boards were made too independent.

a)	All large orgns become inefficient.

b)	Support R. S.C.’s point.

	Not sure an efficiency unit created by Bd. wd. do.  Want it at Minister’s initiative.  Minister hasn’t – or shdn’t have – technical staff. Wd. be duplication.  Must therefore be able to say there is a mechanism wh. can automatically exercise supervision.  Otherwise, we risk periodical purges – most unwholesome.

	In M/H, I am creating large supply organn.  Believe it’s run by competent people.  But you don’t appoint auditors because you believe accountant is dishonest.  My people mustn’t resent inspn by outsiders.

	It may be we shd. be too hasty.  Cd. wait.  Anyway wd. like to see x/ first.

	This is a really important constitutional point.



P.M.	Qua public accountability I see force of havg. unit wh. works at Minister’s discretion.



H.M.	I wdn’t object.  But socialisg. Ministers &amp; Bds. wd. regard this as invasion of their responsibility for management.

	I suppose Minister cd. ask tht. Bd. shd. invite unit to look into this or that, &amp; allow Ministers to see report.



P.	We have had experience of this.  Have proved you can’t get re-organn thro’ Dpl. staffs.  Must have efficiency unit.  How to use it?  Attracted by A.B.’s views.  But better to let Bd. employ them.  Goes more smoothly.  Prs. Minister shd. have over-riding right to order their use.



P.M.	No guarantee tht. Bd. wd. use it, if their creature.



H.W.	Nor wd. it satisfy Parlt.  But Bds. wd. resent &amp; wd. cover up.  Compromise: semi-independent body e.g. B.I.M. cd. set up  unit for this.  i.e. B.I.M. wd. select whom Minister shd. appoint to make such an enquiry.



G.S.	Is public accountability met by private report by person apptd by Minister.

		Believe rpts. wd. have to be public.  Public wdn’t be satisfd with less.

	Prs. periodical public enquiries every 4 years.



B.	Current criticism is political.  L.P.T.B. = monopoly.  No ques. of accountability of efficiency has ever bn. raised.  Only because of natn tht. (political) criticism has begun.  In Transport Act, I met this point by ensuring tht. executives wd. be under constant review of B.T. Commn responsible for policy, economy etc.  Let’s have memoranda first.



R.S.C.	L.P.T.B. had financial incentive to efficiency – cd. be taken over by debenture holders.



G.A.I.	Support H.M.  Independent empires.  Must assert Cab. control.



P.M.	Discount political criticism.  But how satisfy public discontent?  The Minister must.  If eff. unit is right instrument, it must be put into hands of Minister not board.



H.G.	Minister has apptd best Bd. he can get.  They will resign, if suggd tht. others know better.  What are the consultants to examine?

	Indep. enquiry.  Rpt must be publd.  If favourable, no one impressed.  If critical, means changing board.



N.B.	In end, efficiency &amp; low cost must be answer.  And Minister must satisfy Parlt.  And by facts, not experts’ reports.  Important points:

a)	relns betwn. Bd. &amp; Minister.

b)	appln of scientific method &amp; good labour relations.

	Favour discn with chairman:  but not until we know what they have done and what we want.



J.	If the unit is independent &amp; can be brght. in on occasion by Minister, there is no reason why it shd. not usually be called in by the board.



H.M.	I take it all my other suggns are approved?  no dissent.

	On efficiency checks:  but it is chairman tht. we are in logical &amp; political dilemma.  Here are proposals wh. have bn. made.



	What do you think of them.  Or what other proposals have you.

		Need not put this solely as necessary to satisfy Parlt. – political criticism will never be checked – satisfy reasonable public opinion.



			General approval in principle for L.P.’s memo.

	

 			S.I.M. Cttee to discuss method of approach to boards.
