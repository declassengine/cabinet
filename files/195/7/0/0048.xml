C.M. 52 (49)					12th August, 1949



1.	    Retail Trade Wages.

			                            [Enter H.G., J.S., D.J., &amp; Edwards. E.E.B.



G.A.I.	Put memo in because views of B/T. related to 5% cut in profit margins.

	Arguments pro &amp; con are in memo.

	Retail Drapery Councils adjourned consn for 3 wks. because 5% cut.  They represent industry.

		That one won’t arise.

	But co-ordn Cttee to secure uniformity in retail trades condns.  They have raised no objn.

	How can we refuse one &amp; pass others?

	Refusal of all wd. give Parly diffies.  Repns already v. delay, by lr. &amp; depn.

	Procedure:  how long can I keep it bouncing to’ and fro’.

	New rates higher than some other wage councils.  But not much.

		92/6 average for food trades.  But higher in many others already. New principle here is provn for increments by ages.  Only at age 24 do averages go above existg. levels elsewhere.

	Am I to fix a lower increase?  That means Govt. wage-fixing.

		A simple refusal wd. provoke Parlt. opposn.

	White Paper argument.  These are in realm of v. low wages.  90% or so. Best at age 21 is 93% in Ldn.  Costs at least £5 to live in Ldn.

	Recommend approval of these orders as they are made.

	Food retailers:  arguing about margins:  but employers were on the Council.



P.M.	Claims made after White Paper.  Why is there special case for these?



G.A.I.	Two methods.  Free negotn between. both sides.  These require us.

	(We went wrong when we allowed agric. prices to reflect increased wages.)

		Govt. sanction.

	These Wage Councils work on a legislative mandate.

	Are we to hold wages where we have a legislative authy but nowhere else.



P.M.	Are wages above minima?



G.A.I.	Big firms are:  &amp; wd. not go above new minima.  Small firms don’t. Unfair.

	Figures of cost given are maxima.  Not all will in fact need full increase because above existg. minima.



P.M.	Why  not mentioned when 5% cut on B/T. margins was made?



G.A.I.	I was busy with rlway strike.



H.G.	V. bad time for any increases wh. might intensify inflationary pressure.

	Minister has a discretion under Act.  Under W. Paper a wage increase authd by a Minister wd. have to be admitted as reason for increased margins.



Edw.	V. diff. for us.  We are involved in wage claims involvg. price-controlled goods.

	In last 2 wks. rather rough time with retailers.  Cab. realised 5% cut might put some out of business. Wage increases wd. make it much worse.

	Wd. be justifiable to refer these back on ground tht. present economic circs. won’t stand  increased costs of distribn.

	We cdn’t retain our 5% cut.



G.A.I.	That one has bn. referred back.



J.S.	Food.  Acceptance wd. be serious.  £9m wd. have to be found – from subsidy, margins or prices.  Nothg. can come from margins. Prices or subsidy therefore wd. be inconsistent with directive on public expendre, as well as White Paper.

	Unpopular but right to make a stand.  We can’t expect to resist inflation if we yield on this.

	Straight refusal.



D.J.	M/L. has to decide.

	Shd. do so in light of W. Paper.

	He must refuse.  Not undermanned industry – the opposite.

	Advise rejection.



J.	Support rejection.  This wd. invite inflation.



 E.E.B.	Inflationary pressure is increasing.

	Other claims coming along.

	If we give way here, how can we check that pressure.



A.	Unfortunate this wasn’t before us when we authd 5% cut.

	But will be said: you establd these Councils: wages under £5 p. wk.:  now do we defend that.  Inflation isn’t a suff. excuse for attackg. people paid as little as this.

	Cd. we hold up B/T. cases and allow others?



H.G.	They are willing to work for these rates.

	They cd. get out easily.

	We don’t want any more manpower in distn.

	M/L. cd. stall on ground tht. drapery is under review.

	Or he cd. refuse as inconsistent with White Paper policy.



G.A.I.	When they come back, at what figure do I accept?



C.J.	Inflationary effect.

	Refer back on public grounds.

	Not likely, to prejudice statutory wage-fixing machinery.

		National considns must on occasion over-ride.



D.J.	Labour force in distn is rising, despite these wages.

		If we agree to raising rates, we accelerate that process.

		We chuck away chance of influencing man-power distribn.



G.A.I.	If they re-submit at lower figures,  I must come back to cabinet.



A.	Must reject on principle, not on a particular figure.



G.A.I.	They will be re-submitted about the time of the T.U.C. mtg. in September.



			Agree:  Refer back.

			             In consn of genl. economic condns, and therefore 

			             unwilling to do anything which wd. increase prices,

			             or prevent their being reduced.



			                             [Enter H.McN., G. Walker &amp; Clutterbuck



2.	    Dollar Situation:  Canada.



P.M.	Earlier decn.  Clutterbuck’s views.

	Canada: not ready to discuss long-term yet.

	Want them on our side in W’ton talks.

	Unwise therefore to raise long-term ques. in advance of those talks.

	Aide-memoire.  Recommend this be submitted.



D.J.	Personal view.  I still favour raising these ques. with Canada.

		Shall have to say “hold sterling” in the end.  Cd. have made a case for earlier warning.  Wd. have liked to end memo with warning tht. unless E.C.A. dollars available we shall have to insist on paymt. in Sterling.



P.M.	Ques. of tactics.



A.C.	Don’t despair of long-term solution.

	But they think of that as 2nd stage, wh. shdn’t be discussed until we know results of 1st stage.

	We must keep them on our side in W’ton.  On E.C.A. our interests are identical.



A.	Supplied A.C.

	We shd. join with them in challenging E.C.A. position.

	But let it emerge in conversn with Canadians we shall have to find some long-term solution not involvg. our paying dollars.



P.M.	Will emerge at W’ton.



G.W.	Support A.C.’s tactics.

	Holding sterling is only half an argument until we have our position in W’ton plan.

	Hop A.C. will put in another memo to Canada on c) in 174.



J.S.	Fitzgerald is pessimistic about our getting admn fr. U.S. tht. they won’t declare wheat surplus.

	Accompanying memo, cd. we not say to Canada tht. if we don’t get E.C.A. financing we can’t renew these contracts in dollars.

	As a matter of arithmetic.



P.M.	Comes clearly out of memo.

	Can’t go on with this trade – dollar assistance is no long-term solution.



			Agreed:  Proceed as proposed by P.M.



			                          [Exit H.G., D.J., J.S., McN., G.W. Clutterb.





3.	    Conditions of Labour in Non-Metropolitan Territories.



C.J.	As in memo.



P.M.	Will any other country enforce these?



C.J.	Won’t hurt us, for we are doing these things already.



			Ratification approved.
