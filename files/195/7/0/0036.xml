C.M. 40 (49)					2nd June, 1949



1.	Parliament.

			                                      [Enter W.W., H.McN., J.S., Barnes

H.M.	Business for week after Recess.



	Private Members Bills.



H.M.	Hairdressers.  Are we to put whips on to prevent H/C doing a nonsense?



W.W.	House is sympathetic to it.



A.B.	Back benches opposing Front Bench for the sake of it.



H.M.	Ch. Whip is examining precedents.





2.	Council of Europe.



H.M.	Composn schled.

	Opposn: 3 Fr. Benches out of six.  P.M. has therefore included H.D., H.M. &amp; W.W.

	F.O. &amp; Parlt. pundits a bit at odds.  On f. policy those handling delegns will seek to get F. O. views accepted.  But on procedure, management discipline etc., Ministers in delegn must have the responsibility.



A.B.	We had bias v. incldg. Ministers. for these reasons.  For they will have to agree with Cab. &amp; F.O. what they are to say, or they may be in variance with Ministers on Ministerial Cttee.

	This will cause trouble.

	Means also only non-Dpt. Ministers because others will be exhausted in August.

	Was v. serious blunder to send Ministers.  Bound to cause disunity w’in Cabinet.  H.M. must be on a string from F.O.



A.W.	U.K. must be properly represented.

	But Ministers, if on delegn , must spk. in acc. with F.O. views on policy.



P.M.	If we had included only back benchers, Opposn wd. seize leadership of delegn.  Also, other countries will have Ministerial rank figures.



R.S.C.	Shan’t we be substantially bound as a Govt. by anything for wh. 3 Ministers vote?  Will suggest Govt. not Parlt. is represented here.  Confuses Council with Minl Cttee.  Leader of House cd. go in personal capacity:  but 3 is diffr.



H.D.	Wasn’t anxious to go.  Ready to do as P.M. asked.

	No necessity for clash btwn. F.O. Ministers &amp; these Ministers.

	But treat this as wholly experimental.  No precedent for future years.

	Intrigues to get control.  Sandys has taken office in Strasbourg.

		That must be watched.

	Also relations betwn. our members of Labour Party &amp; Socialists fr. elsewhere.

	Alternative wd. relieve Dpl. Minister if appointed.



A.B.	Decision shd. have bn. taken by Cabinet.

	If U.K. Ministers outvoted, it will be repd as defeat for U.K. Govt.



T.W.	They cd. abstain.



R.S.C.	Fr. Socialists regard this as forum in wh. to fight “controls” v. Catholics.

		Ital. &amp; Belg. Socialists prob. intend the same.

	Do we take sides against Catholics?  Against Fr. Govt.?  Awkward repercussions in O.E.E.C.



H.M.	That is argument v. setting it up at all.

	If you do:  either inter-Parlt. Union or potentially Parlt. of Europe.  Unless the second, not worth doing it all.  Important therefore to get its procedure and traditions right.

	We shall work with other Socialist repves.  But must get U.K. delegn  view on matters affectg. U.K. interests.  On f. policy, F.O. advice available.

	Decision tht. Ministers shd. be included can be reversed by Cabinet.



P.M.	Won’t escape R.S.C.’s diffies by not incldg. Ministers.  Our delegn will be thought to be in touch with Govt.



A.B.	No objn to L.P. going for a bit to give it a cachet.  Better to exclude other Ministers.  Don’t invite diffies at outset.  Let it grow organically. Only at a later stage tht. Council shd. be clothed with Govt. authy.

		Put Ministers in later if need be.



P.M.	If it goes wrong, Ministers can w’draw &amp; leave it to alternates.

	But must get it started right.



R.S.C.	Fr. originally suggd a Govt. &amp; Opposn assembly.  We opposed that, &amp; worked out relns btwn. Min. Cttee &amp; inter-Parly. Assembly.  Are we not now putting more Ministers into Assembly than into Cttee &amp; inviting a clash btwn. 2 organs. both on Governmntl. level.  I’m not happy about Govt. participn in Assembly – at least at early stage.



H.McN.	Personally against:  but E.B. has agreed.



C.E.	Think Ministers shd. be included.  Diffies arise fr. incln of non-Govt. repves.

H.W.	Ministers this time:  have ques. open for the future.  Give it a start.

		Prevent Opposn fr. appearing to spk. for U.K.  Help foreign Socialists to boost Socialism.



A    	Agreed with H.W.



J.     	Case for beginning with Ministers:  but wd. like to get it later on a free inter Parlt. basis so that we aren’t bound by its conclns.



G.T.	Agree with J.  Min. Cttee is to control Assembly:  that wd. be better.

		But Opposn nominns compel us to include Ministers.



A.W.	May be beginning of Fed. Eur. Parlt.  Must therefore have people standing in our Delegn.



T.W.	Agree with J.  No precedent for future:  but give Delegn a status this time.



G.A.I.	Minister at initial stages.  But declare that Ministers won’t be there all the time.



C.J.	Theoretically R.S.C. is right.  But give it good send off by incldg. 

	Ministers this time – w’out prejudice to future.



P.M.	Ministers shd. go this time – no precedent for future.



			Read names of back bench members.





3.	Iron and Steel Bill.



H.M.	Composn



A.	Provl. understandg. with Opposn.  List of ammendmts not v. large.  Promise to return it to H/C by 21/7.

	Vesting dates:  insist on July ’51 (ammendmt down).  Will press that. 

		M/S. will submit memo on that.





4.	National Insurance Schemes &amp; Sickness Absence.



			                                                             [Enter J.G., H.G. G.S.



G.A.I.	No significant increase, in manufg. industries, among workers.



H.G.	Facts already available show marked increase in mines – as in memo.

	V. serious factor in coal prodn.  Costs us the 4m. tons we need.

	Can go on looking for causes.  But broad picture is clear:  increase in time to recover from minor sickness or injury.  My preliminary conclns are set out in memo.  (£6 p. wk in example included £2 p. wk PAYE repaymt.)  Slacker certification.

	V. diff. problem.  Don’t pre-judge results of any enquiry.  But must take it seriously.  Likely to get worse – e.g. Cumberland has 4% increase as cpd. with average of 2%.

	Cttee – not a public enquiry.  High level.  Shd. visit mines etc.



J.G.	Concur in M/L memo.

	Qua sickness no appreciable increase.  Peak contd this year to end April because epidemics:  but on average no genl. increase.

1.1	 Tendency for serious accidents to decline while minor acc. increase.  Men are prob. staying away longer.  Waiting days were cut down in H/C.

	Investign procedg. on ind. injuries – M/L. M/N.I. and N.C.B.  Rpt. is expected in a month.  Wait for that.

	What wd. enquiry in coal-fields cover?  Facts available in Ldn.  If it’s enquiry into working of suppl. scheme, we shd. have to bring N.U.M. in.  We shd. have to meet both sides of industry.



G.S.	Related ques.  Effect of increased sickness benefit in R.O.F.’s since Oct ’48.

		In 3 filling factories 1.5% rate has risen to 11%.

		In all factories, rate has risen 21/2 – 3 times.



B.	No special experience.



A.B.	No evce tht. easier certifn is responsible – for same machinery as before. Agree no immediate medical challenge from employer.  That wd. restore old coal-owner atmosphere.  Don’t import “colliery doctor” again.

	Long-term remedy:  pay on a salary basis all the time.  Then the manager will always be interested in date of man’s return to work.

	Attitude of salaried worker twds. absence from work is quite difft.

	If any enquiry is to be held, N.U.M. must be associated with it.



H.M.	Cd. Social Survey be used to get facts.       }

	Also Human Factors Panel                          } R.S.C.   Let Cttee decide this.

	Agree tht. N.U.M. &amp; N.C.B. shd. consent to enquiry.



H.G.	The enquiry mentioned by J.G. has a narrower object.

	We shd. put it on wider basis.  Agree N.U.M. shd. be consulted.



			Agree { Institute enquiry:  let J.G. enquiry go on &amp; give 

			           { their results to broader Cttee.

			           { M/S to report on R.O.F.’s.

				[Exit G.S., J.G.

5.	Dock Strike.



C.E.	No sign of change.

	Can unload all ships (mil. labour) by end/week.

	Serious situation, however, because arose fr. Canadian seamen’s strike.

	Govt. can’t deal with more than 2 ports at a time because mil. resources are so limited.  Comms are preparing to spread trouble to other ports if A’ mouth isn’t back by end/week.

	Union is opposed to strike.  But its local branch at Lpl. anyway seems to be in favour.



G.A.I.	Tho’ decided last night to isolate Dromore, Deakin now says this wd. be disastrous.  Wd. provoke boycott of our ships in Canada.  But volunteers have unloaded some tomatoes at Lpl.

	Handicapped throughout by obscurity in facts.

	Investigns might continue – e.g. thro’ employers – to get Dromore moved. Comm. attempts to bring out other Lpl. dockers have failed. Glasgow &amp; Leith &amp; Ldn. have all decided against striking.

	I recommend we clear ships before Montreal City: &amp; decide then wtr. to touch that ship.

	Ballot is being taken in A’mouth.



N.B.	V. serious.  Two weeks.  Deakin has been “confident” throughout – but results haven’t justified his confidence.

	6.000 is fair propn of Lpl. dockers.

	Canadian strike in Canada has failed.  Condemned by dockers &amp; seamen there.

	Find means of bringing these facts home to our dockers.



B.	“We are containing A’mouth.

	Ques.  can we take any action to hold sitn at Lpl. &amp; prevent it from spreading to other ports.”

	That was view of Em. Cttee last night.  But my latest informn is tht. new Cttee is attemptg. to spread the informn.

	Dromore was in Lpl. and other U.K. ports.



A.B.	Why do employers at diffr. ports take diff. action.



B.	I am not responsible.



C.E.	Cttee decision:  unload ships in A’mouth in order, incldg. M. City when we get to it.



G.A.I.	Decide about M. City when time comes.



A.B.	Dromore.  Regard ship as “in dispute” &amp; remove suspension of the men who refused to load her.



B.	Decn was by D &amp; Harbour Board, a statutory body on which Union is represented.

J.S.	V. dangerous not to remove suspensn.



G.A.I.	Don’t instruct Board.  Get them to suggest it themselves.

		Let me get individual employer to co-operate.



			Agreed.





6.	Railway Strike.



N.U.R. will advise men to go back to work.
