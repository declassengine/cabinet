C.M. 18(50).				4th April, 1950.





	National Health Service.                        [H.G., E.S. &amp; H.H.M.



P.M.	Need for guarantee tht. ceiling can be effectively enforced.  Genl.

		agreemt. on that necessity.  Ques:  what means.



A.	Costing too much.  Inadequate control.

	Where do we seek economies?

	Not attracted by hotel charge for hospital beds.  Worst cases.  Wd.

		destroy conceptn of free service.  200.000 mental (E &amp; W) –

		cdn’t be charged.  300.000 others wdn’t give yield desired.

	Favour spreading capital cost of hospital bldg etc.

	Hospitals:  biggest item.  Not controlled.  Extravagance by Hos. Bds.

		This shd. be firmly attacked.

	McNeil’s approach is good.   G.P. service:  no chance of reductn.

			                             Specialists:  too much being paid, esp. to

		part-time.  They have got away with murder.  E.g. £2.127 p.a.

		risg. to 3.236 for 4 day attendance at hospital with as much 

		opportunity as ever for private practice.  Juniors not so bad.  

		System of special awards needs revision.

			                             Ophthalmic Service.  Shdn’t be spending

		£24 m. on this.  We cd. charge for extras here.

			                             Dentists.  Need better advice.  Must get

		economy.  Cd. have some charges.

			                             Drugs.  Excessive cost.  £26 m. for E &amp;

			                                      W.

	In 1920 I was advised by a group – recommended clinic system.

		This wd. be cheaper e.g. for eyes &amp; ears.  Wd. like to start

		developing this at once.  To avoid disadvantages of using 

		opticians.

	Teeth &amp; eyes:  was a backlog:  demand shd. fall.  Cd. legitimately

		charge for extras.

	Summary:	 a)  Require attendance at clinics.  ? for eyes &amp; ears.

			 b)  Appoint small body to recommend economies by

			             dentists, chemists etc.  Pay them if necessary.

			             Recommend effective system of financial control			             incldg. hospital service.



A.B.	After R.S.C.’s decn to fix a ceiling for 1950/51. I put things in hand.

	Much of what A. suggests is in hand.

	BMA were met y’day.  I resisted their demand for increase in capitn

		fees.  I also hinted attack on specialists remuneration wasn’t

		out of ques.

	Specs. – decision explained to Cab. y’day.

	Have spoken to Moran re merit awards &amp; told him these categories

		shdn’t all be filled up.  Total for specialists is only £13 m.

	Met Chairman of Hosp. Bds. this a.m. &amp; discussed fin. control for

		1950/51.  Agree with P.M.’s opening remark.  Am going to get 

		fr. Bds. monthly statement of expendre, so tht. I can check any

		tendencies to over-spending.  Am forcing tht. in spite of 

		complaints of bureaucratic control.  Have told them that any

		savings can be spent e.g. on tuberculosis beds.  Fairly sure

		there’s no danger of Suppl. Est. for 1950/51.

	Dentists.  Negotiating further redn of remuneration.  Proposal wh. I

		put up in Oct. can’t go fwd. because lack of 10-15 dental offrs.

		Cd. save £1 m. a year.  Can’t get them w’out paying more than

		Ty. wish, because of wage-freeze.

	Drugs.  BMA. will, I believe, now deal with drs. who over prescribe.

		Cohen Cttee Rpt. on proprietary medicines will give us help.

		Together these 2 things will give us more than 1/= charge.

	My concln.   A Cttee under P.M.’s chairmanship to wh. I shd. make a

		monthly rept. on progress of expendre in reln to estimate.

		That wd. go far to meet Cab. diffy.

	On principle:  disastrous to impose charges.  For Opposn will say 

		Govt. are makg. patient pay because adminve incompetence.

	Want  i) dental officers  ii) separate capital expendre fr. revenue in

		order to distinguish betwn. cost of m’taing. existg. service and

		cost of expanding it.

	Suppl. Est. for 2 yrs. gave impn tht. expre out of control.  That ????

		only climate of opinion.  Let’s have one year under a ceiling.



J.G.	Must be a ceiling.  If it’s to be effective, must be economies.

		My view:  while there’s much we can do fr. centre, we must have

		more effective local control.  Can public opinion be brght. to bear 

		on this?  M/N.I. are about to appoint local advisory cttees – to

		keep a watch on local adminn of scheme.  Cd. same be done for 

		N.H. Service?  Our supporters wdn’t object – they don’t like 

		extravagance.

	Charges:	i)   shall be charging some people who paid nothg. before.

			     Panel patients paid nothing for drugs.  They regarded

			     them as paid out of their contns.   They will ask for it to

			     be made a charge on Insurance Fund – wh. has surplus

			     of £100/150 m.

			ii)  Hospitals etc.  Many localities provided treatment free.

			      Those facilities have bn. w’drawn because introdn of

			      N.H. Service.

	If some charges are to be considered, let us examine i) and ii) first.



E.S.	Am anxious to preserve this Service.

	Deduction fr. sickness benefit.  This has establd principle of hotel

		charge.  But applies only to poorest.  No outcry over this.

		Wd. have thght. they wd. have discovered that rich aren’t makg.

		this contribn.   Total collected:  only £2-3 m.

	Charge for prescriptions.  Mistake.  For test of Service is in consultg.

		room of g.p. – where most have their contact with Service.  They

		will be aggrieved at charge for services wh. panel patients never 

		had to pay.

	Favour charge for hospital treatment rather than drugs.  Latter wd.

		make woman think twice before takg. child to a doctor.

	Proprietary drugs.  Racket.  Pushed by salesmen, mainly medical

		students who have come down in exams.

	Clinics.  Support A.’s proposal.  Cd. often be tacked on to Maternity

		&amp; Child Welfare Clinics where bldgs. are large.



A.B.	Can’t get  opticians.



E.S.	Wd. be nucleus of Health Centre.

	Dentists.  Racket.  Dental Nursing Service on lines of N.Z. scheme.

		Work can be done by nurses with special training.   Dentists wd.

		oppose it.  But N.Z. did it.

	Public re-action.  Common-sense people realise tht. sensible Govt.

		must seek economics.



H.H.M.		i)	Disabled ex-Service man has right to free treatment.

		ii)	Run 13 hospitals, containg. many N.H.S. patients.

		iii)	Make appliances for N.H.S.

	i)	Charge for Prescriptions wasn’t popular with us:  but we worked

			out plan for dealing with our people.  Cd. do the same,

			more easily, for other charges.  Remember that I shd. have 

			pay the charge for war pensioners.

	ii)	Any further hosp. charge wd. be repugnant to public opinion.

			For no abuse of hospitals – no-one goes for fun.  Better

			apply charges to sectors where p. opinion thinks there is

			abuse or extravagance.

		My Dpt. has contn to make on economy of hosp. adminn.  Hope

			our experience won’t be overlooked.  E.g. bulk-buying of

			hosp. food.

	iii)	My Dpt. is on w. party studying means of reducg. costs of 

			appliances.  They expect to achieve substantial economics.

			Am expanding my manufacture of specs – wh. cd. be 

			yardstick to measure costs of private manufacture.  Doing 

			same with eyes &amp; teeth.

	Charge for appliances wd. not be regarded so repugnant as for

		hospitals.  Teeth, limbs, specs. etc.



G.T.	Ceiling.  What will give most value w’in that.  Charge – won’t deter

		the rich from frills and may deter poor from necessary treatment.

	Dental service in schools – undermined by N.H.S. wh. is paying

		dentists far more than value of their services to community.

		Priority needs are being neglected as a result.

	Given a ceiling (which is inevitable), I wd. put priority needs first.

		And I support therefore approach of H.McN.



C.E.	On first discn of scheme H.M. and I proposed tht. hosp. service shd. be 

		under l.a. control.  Experience since shows tht. Chairman of l.a.

		finance cttee is essential feature of hosp. adminn.

		My earlier expce of takg. over poor law hospitals.

	Failure of Service, on Hosp. Bds. doctors are too numerous &amp; too

		powerful.  They have pursued perfectionist policy.

	For real economy, we must get hospitals away from doctors.

		You cdn’t have schools run entirely by teachers.

	Legn needed to put Ty. or M/H. repve on Hosp. Bds. to take place of

		chairman of Finance Cttee of l.a.

	Support A.B. re capital expenditure.

	Charging.  Might defeat object of hospital service.  Few people stay in

		hospital now for more than 2 wks.  Diff. to collect charge after

		he’s gone.  Few cd. pay full charge – over £10 p. wk.

	My view:  fix a ceiling:  must recover financial control:  may involve

		legn empowering compliance with estimates – if so, that legn cd.

		be faced.

	Are we riding for a fall over this?  If so, this isn’t a good issue.

		In my areas, some of this a.m.’s proposals (e.g. hospital charges)

		wd. dismay our supporters.

	Fix ceiling:  &amp; be satisfied tht. we have means of enforcing compliance

		with estimates.



H.D.	Endorse A.B.’s suggn of Cab. Cttee – to assist in economy drive.

		We are spending too much on this.

		Proceed by squeezing out extravagance &amp; rackets vice charges.

		This shd. produce real economy.

	Doubts &amp; apprehensions re charges.  For some appliances perhaps:

		this shd. be considered.  Perhaps enough at this stage to take

		power to impose charges by Regn.



E.Sh.	M/H. was in diffy. with new Service.

	My colleagues seem to be v. charges.  But at same time want drive to 

		curtail expre – by cutting out rackets.  What cd. you save by that

		means – chicken-feed:  e.g. £1 m. on spectacle frames.

	What about Service Estimates?  We asked for £840 m.  We had to

		come down to £810 m.  Then to £780 m.  We accepted redn of

		£60 m.  Not easy.  And “no Suppl. Estimates.”  Just as important

		to country as N.H.S.  Why shdn’t this apply to all?  If so, useless

		to think it can be achieved by miscell. adminve economies.

	Which ceiling do we take?  £392 or £350 m.  Must fix some figure.

		And face the diffies.



H.McN.		Hosp. charges.  Figure I gave y’day was optimistic.

		Mental 40%  M.D. 8%  T.B. 11%  Chronic sick 5%.

		Only 36% - any poss. of recovery:  &amp; their stay averages

		only 2 wks.

	Cut regud must be sought by restn of services.



P.M.	No one expects large revenue fr. charges.  Main purpose wd. be to

		deter abuse.  Worth considering further for appliances.

		But any general return to charges wd. make service repel

		vice attract.

		Genl. view:  no charges wh. wd. alter character of scheme.

	No. of valuable suggns.  Useful to have Cab. Cttee.

	Cab. are alarmed by progressive increase in expendre.

	Many diff. methods of control.  Injectn of local control needs thought.

		Needs examn.  Incldg. local public opinion.

	Dental services are scandal.  Want consn of a) insprs.  b) clinics.

	Don’t be put off by “only saves £1 m.”  Aggregate of millions may

		result.

	Must have ceiling.



R.S.C.	Can’t accept that attitude.

	Expre has mounted.  Last year I said if it contd to grow we shd. have

		to take steps to control it.  Has contd to grow – out of all propn

		to its value or reln to other services e.g. educn.  Automatic

		expansions.  Forecast another £150 m.

	We can’t afford to watch expre growing.  Service will inevitably

		expand.  No room for it, even at ceiling of £392 m.  Steady

		pressure, opening beds etc., will continue.

	Suppose we rely on squeezing.  When we find in June limits are 

		being exceeded we are faced with – a) charge  b) shutting beds

		c) Suppl. Est.  I reject c).  Cab. will have to choose betwn. b) and

		a).  And b) is not a practicable choice.

	What I want is M/H. to have power to impose charges.  If economics

		materialise, we needn’t use it.  But its existence will be pressure

		on whole adminn.

	Ceiling.  £392 m. is ceiling for 1950/51.  Don’t suggest alteration of 

		that.  But I want a lower ceiling for future years.  Ready for Cab.

		Cttee to settle that, in next few months – somewhere below 

		£392 m. – to run for a no. of years.

	I want also to say in Budget debate tht. M/H. will be empowered to

		make charges if &amp; when it becomes necessary in order to keep

		w’in ceiling.



A.B.	Makes worst of both worlds.  As with Housing, we shall make 

		ambiguous Statement wh. we mayn’t have to implement.  Let us

		get on with attempts to economise:  &amp; defer announcg. 

		alternative until it becomes necessary.  We shall take pol. knocks

		w’out fin. benefits.  Universal depression w’out tangible 

		financial results.



P.M.	Cdn’t elaborate on Statement re charges because no agreemt. in Cab.

		on what charges.  Haven’t considered form of legn etc.

		What purpose in saying this?



R.S.C.	For w’out this power we are deceiving ourselves in claiming no

		further Suppl. Estimate.



P.M.	Two steps.	  a)  Declare ceiling.

			  b)  Consider means of keeping w’in it.



H.M.	My fear is that in 6 mos.’ time, we shall be no better off.

	You are leaving R.S.C. on a limb.  Nothing more than promises –

		and vague words.  R.S.C. must show H/C. tht. he means

		business.



P.M.	But don’t make announcemt. until you know what instrument is.



J.	R.S.C. has made his case.  It needn’t be by charges.  Might be cutting

		back services, or reducg. fees.  He must be empowered to say 

		that £392 will not be exceeded – and how.



P.M.	V. well.  But don’t put charges in forefront of p’mme.



A.	Sure you can get this Service for £392 m.



			Agreed:  P.M. and R.S.C. to consider &amp; bring up on

			               Thursday.
