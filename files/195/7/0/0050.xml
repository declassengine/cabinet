C.M. 54(49).				29th August, 1949.

				(2.p.m.)



	1.	China.                                  [Enter  C.O.S., 3 Serv. Ministers, J.S.



E.B.	U.S. really want to get out &amp; then apply economic &amp; other pressure to

		Comm. Govt.

	We, on the other hand, have favoured our comm. interests remaing.

		Feel it wd. be mistake for us to w’draw.  Kept Consuls etc. there.

	On Comm. Govt. forming, we shd. have to w’draw Amb. while we

		consider recognn.

	New point.  Safe-conduct of ships.  Told this a.m. there is doubt wtr.

		blockade is illegal, and tht. we cdn’t justify escorting merchant

		vessels in.

	Recommn  (1) falls anyway because reply isn’t satisfactory (?)



H.W.	We have already announced in H/C. that blockade is illegal.



P.M.	Shd. have consulted L.O.’s earlier, before makg. such announcement.



R.S.C.	Get L.O.O:  if it supports view tht. we cd. force this blockade, act as

		recommended.



P.M.			Agreed.



C.A.S.	As an operation this is feasible.

	Up to mouth of river, threat is fr. air.  Carrier can cope.

	At approaches, surface ships.  A cruiser cd. cope.

	Up the river, no cover can be given.  Shall want Comm. assurances

		they won’t fire.  Air risk will have to be accepted.

	Risk:  if Nationalists attack, it’s act of war wh. wd. call for air action

		fr. us on their air bases.

	H. Kong:  while carrier away on this, it cdn’t play its part in defence

		of H. Kong.

	Better to run it from Japan.  We have shipping running into Kobe.

		Wd give surprise &amp; reduce risk of attack on way in.



D.	No minesweepers there, if area were mined.



C.N.S.	Wd be possible for Chinese to lay mines, but v. unlikely.



A.V.A.	Awkward posn.  We might yet get clash with Comms. over H.K.

		That is our major risk in near future.  Don’t want to weaken our

		defences there by this diversion.

	If Nationalists lose Canton, blockade of Shanghai wdn’t be m’tained.

		Supplies might go in by land.



E.B.	I must evacuate or supply.

	Cab. view earlier was tht. we shd. hang on.



E.Sh.	Risky to w’draw carrier from H. Kong.  Can’t defend H. Kong by

		air w’out it.  And it wd. be exposed to risk of being sunk.

	We must concentrate on defence of H. Kong.  Must be ready for

		attack any time after end/Sept.



C.A.S.	Cdn’t send this party w’out carrier.  For air attack is main risk.

	Carrier not vital to defence of H. Kong.

			Agreed:   Consult L.O.O.

			                If favourable, go ahead as proposed.

			                Get Communist “way leave” before going in.



A.	E.B. to explain to Com. repves in W’ton. ?at U.N. Assembly?

		Agreed.			[Exit  J.S.

	(? Does this really apply to Item 2)





	2.	Hong-Kong.	[Enter  G. Walker.



E.B.	Para. 16 is nub of this memo.

	Stress final part of para. 17.



C.J.	Cab. suggested earlier we shd. put up long-term policy.

		But can’t peer so far into future.

		Stand fast &amp; await repns.



A.B.	Goes beyond recent Cab. decisions.

	E.g. para. 12. x/.  Goes v. far.  Previously we said merely we wdn’t

		allow status of H.K. to be changed by force.



P.M.	Cab. need not endorse para. 12 – or 13 either.

		Might get 3 or 4 stable Govts. in China.



R.S.C.	Shd. like to consider again.  Believe inter-nationalisation with U.S.

		support is only means of staying in H. Kong.  Unwise to wait.

		Now is only time when we cd. have chance of winning acceptce.

		Too late if we wait until revolution in China.



E.B.	Lease (New Territories) pre-supposes it’s their territory.  cd. only 

		hand it back.



R.S.C.	Cd. sub-let to international agency.



E.B.	Doubt it.



R.S.C.	Cd argue tht. leased Territories went with H. Kong, to whomever it was

		handed over.



A.V.A.	Don’t move at present.  Sign of weakness in S.E.A. if we show any

		sign of concessions.



A.W.	Events may move so quickly tht. you won’t have time to discuss.

	So long as we hold it alone, we are suspect.  Want to get other nations

		into this with us.  International – or offer Chinese Govt. a share

		in its management.

	Cdn’t agree tht. U.K. alone shd. try to hold H.K. indefinitely.



E.Sh.	Can defend it, short of R. help to Chinese aggressors.

	H. Kong is ours.  Any talk of internationalisation wd. weaken our 

		position not only there but throughout S.E.A.



P.M.	Stand pat w’out public discn.

	But cdn’t E.B. sound Acheson privately on internationalisation.



A.B.	If Ch. Comms. challenge our prestige by attackg. our posn in 

		H. Kong, we are on weak ground.  To be driven out now wd.

		weaken our posn in S.E.A.  -  Agreed.  -  But to say retentn of

		H.K. v. a hostile China is vital to our prestige is to stick our

		neck out.

	Chifley doesn’t think it right merely to await events.

	Must keep open mind &amp; discuss with Acheson before B. prestige

		becomes engaged &amp; wd. involve loss of face to w’draw.



E.B.	China is Member of Security Council, wh. can’t function w’out them.

	Willing to study internatn.  But doesn’t affect this memo.



P.M.	Only suggestg. informal approach to Acheson on internationn.



E.B.	Remember U.S. is scuttling fr. China.  And F.D.R. thght. we shd.

		quit H. Kong.



R.S.C.	Then try to get U.S. commd now to this kind of policy.

		Get them into sympathetic position.



E.B.	Willing to explore, w’out commitment, U.S. Govt. views informally.



A.V.A.	Are we to be at U.S. beck &amp; call on all Colonial policy.  Threatens 

		U.K. standard of living.



P.M.	H. Kong is isolated, indefensible etc., &amp; quite diff. fr. most Colonies.



A.V.A.	Most important to our S.E.A. position.



E.Sh.	What do we mean by internationalisation?  Letting Russia in?



E.B.	Willing to consider internatn.

	Can’t commit myself now to wtr. it wd. be wise to speak to Acheson

		on these lines.

	M’while approve my memo. for interim action.



A.W.          y/	International regime, with a seat for a Chinese Govt. if it emerges.

E.B.	Don’t myself believe Comms. will challenge our posn in H. Kong.

		But if they do y/ wdn’t satisfy them.



P.M.	Omit “and democratic” from Para. 16      }  Agreed.

	E.B. to think about internationalisation.   }





	3.	Middle East Policy.



E.B.	Conference – this memo. as genl. guide in development of policy.

	Chance of progress with Egypt in December.



P.M.	No new issues?



E.B.	No.



C.J.	Cyprus is being used now as spring-board.

	Conference at Aden in October.

	Only reservn:  limits to technical staffs available.  This will increase		existg. strain.

	Staffs employed may have to get larger salaries.



R.S.C.	Financial consns.  Can’t provide all the money required.

		Para. 29.  There’s no more money available &amp; we shd. make that		clear.  We are giving supplies up to capacity already.

		We could help on (2) and (5).

	Para. 30.  Can’t increase Jordan allocation to £5½ m.



E.B.	Saves U.K. man-power.



R.S.C.	Then Army Estimates must carry it.  Can’t be added to total

		Defence Estimates.

	Arab refugees.  Have given £1.100.000.  Cd. spring another £¼ to

		½ m. but no more.



E.Sh.	We shd. review Def. expre in M/E.  Might be cheaper to give money 		to Jordan &amp; cut British nos.



P.M.	Let that be discussed in Def. Cttee.



G.W.	Paras. 23-8.  Defence talks with A., N.Z. &amp; S. Afr.  Can we 

		communicate sense of these paras. to those Doms.



A.V.A.	No objn.





	4.	India.



C.J.	No comment.



Att.G.	Wd have preferred to dodge it.  But fear we can’t.



A.V.A.	Liability to mil. service – Indians in U.K.



P.M.	L.O’s to report on that.               Agreed.

			                                          [Exit  Younger, Att. Gen., G.W.			                                          [Enter  H.G. &amp; J.S.



	5.	The Economic Situation. (resumed).



	Sterling Balances.



H.W.	Agree with memo.  Tho’ I doubt wtr. we cd. get U.S. to play.



R.S.C.	Wd never get India or Pakistan to agree to any cancelln.

		 But must get U.S. to realise how gt. a contribn we have by

		this means made to world reconstruction.

	Don’t believe there’s any chance of U.S. puttg. in dollars.



A.	Care U.S. don’t displace us for capital goods in India.



			Noted.





	Oil and Dollars.



H.G.	Disappointg. tht. dollar cost, now $ boom, doesn’t drop below

		$500 m. by 1952.

	P. 2. (top) a surplus – only 4 m. tons, not prs “substantial”, but

		significant.  Runs us into embarrassment over non-discrimn.

		For sterling cos. cd. produce fuel oil &amp; we can’t take it in 

		replacemt. of dollar oil because Art. 9.  Later, surplus will be

		motor spirit – even worse, political position.  We cdn’t hold

		that position.  Discrimn rules must be relaxed.  That is central

		problem – appln of those rules in face of surplus by Br. cos.

	U.S.	remedy may be to cut expansion p’mme.  Against that.

		Must therefore seek an accommodn.

	Important to keep in step with U.S. on oil – because M/East, where

		we want a common policy with them.

	Can’t say in advance what accommn might be reached.  But e.g. U.S.

		co. bldg. refinery nr. So’ton for oil fr. M/East.  They produce

		on sterling cost &amp; take out only profit.  More developmts. on

		those lines wd. help us.



H.W.	Signs tht. Art. 9 may be relaxed.

	This is only interim memo.  For big priority given to oil qua dollar 

		saver.  But now appears to have bn. miscalculated – partly 

		because price changes.

	After W’ton talks hope we shall review oil p’mme &amp; put it into 

		perspective.

A.	$580 m. or 60% of dollar deficit.  W’ton mtg. is therefore occasion to

		press hard the consequences of Art. 9. on oil.

	P. 9. para. 23 says doubtful how far Art. 9. shd. apply to oil trade.

	In addn to para. 15 of covering note, I propose tht. we press for early

		relaxn of Art. 9 in relation to oil – at least to extent of enabling

		us to buy surplus prodn of Br. cos. w’out havg. to take

		correspondg. quantity of dollar oil.



E.B.	Asked H.G. not to press this in early days of this crisis.

	Agree now to this going forward.

	Wd oil agreement proposed by Shinwell/Lakes help us?



H.G.	Doubt it:  but will look into this again.



E.B.	Go back to original Leathers agreement.  That wd. have put us right.

		But B’brook spoilt it.

	Bad record of all oil cos. e.g. in Austria.

	Best to eliminate oil fr. Art. 9.  “Interpretn” wd. bog us down.

		Then seek agreement between Br. and U.S. companies.



A.B.	We’ve bn. waiting a long time for a statement on oil.

		Why haven’t we taken this up long since?

		Shd. have had no dollar deficit.



R.S.C.	No surplus Br. prodn of oil hitherto.



A.B.	Don’t accept that.

	This shd. be a breaking-point with the Americans.



H.W.	Apart fr. Art. 9, have we over-programmed oil expansion?

		That is what I want considered after W’ton.



H.G.	If by avoiding Art. 9 we can use all potential surplus in ’53 we save

		115.000? dollars.  If prices hadn’t fallen &amp; consumptn dropped 

		in U.S., we cd. have saved that even with Art. 9.

	On sales to soft-currency countries, E.P.C. decided we couldn’t cut.



P.M.	The facts have changed.  U.S. need turning now to surplus.



J.S.	Agree can’t go further than this now.

	But after W’ton we must consider how to liquidate net dollar liability

		for oil by ’52.  We shall have to decline to supply oil with a

		dollar content to European countries.

		Reject dollar invoicing as impracticable.



E.B.	Remember we hold the concessions &amp; can’t reduce expansion.

		Persia &amp; Iraq both want the royalties. And anyway we cdn’t 

		hold back development of those countries.





H.W.	Art. 9.  We want suspension for 2/3 years.  If we can’t get that, press

		for sterling area being regarded as single unit for this purpose.

E.B.	Then they wd. demand removal of preferences.



H.W.	No:  for they accept preference removal only in return for tariff

		concessions.



A.B.	We must insist on being 100% free on oil.



R.S.C.	That wd. be unilateral breach of Loan Agreement.



H.W.	Only putting our own interpretn of Agreement.



E.B.	Want to keep U.S. interest in M/E. oil.  Esp. now Canadian finds have

		struck their imagination.  They aren’t as keen on M/E. as they

		were.

			Agreed:  Try to get Art. 9 removed entirely.

			               If that fails, get it agreed tht. it doesn’t apply

			               to oil.



	App. C. of C.P.(49) 175 discussed and approved.

	Para. 22.   Statement to be circulated.
