C.M. 25 (50)					25th April, 1950



1.	    London Dock Strike.

				              [Enter K.Y.



G.A.I.	No material change.  Only Tilbury normal.  Moving in troops will prob. mean permanent men will come out.  Mtg. to-morrow a.m. with processn.

	Feeling in H/C. tht. we must fight this thro’ on behalf of Union.

	Deakin has not bn. to docks himself (in reply to P.M.) &amp; criticism of him is growing.  



P.M.	Ask E.B. to tell him to go.



C.E.	Troops in Ldn. Docks only.  Wanted in Hays Warf &amp; E. India Docks for perishables.  Want to start there to-morrow:  there will be troops available.



			Agreed.



	Recommended Port Cttee have discretion to move troops, subject to reference to Ministers if thought tht. this wd. lead to extension of strike.



			Agreed



H.McN.	Why not get men still at work to unload food ships.



G.A.I.	Turns them into scabs.  They wd. say food ships were “black”.



C.E.	Accommn in parks is being made ready.

	Commr. Of Police is watchg. March qua political.  Watchg. Smithfield too.



G.A.I.	Ldn. (not Natl) Docks Labour Bd. are handling this.  Their statement last night was good.  And they are workg. In consultn with M/L., as Natl. Bd. did not on last occasion.

	No sign of trouble in other ports.  Unlikely while Tilbury remains normal.



H.W.	Owners shdn’t divert ships from London.  That wd. cause trouble in the other ports.  



G.A.I.	Will bring that point to notice of Em. Cttee.



2.	Arab States and Israel.



K.Y.	We have bn. forstalled, to some extent, by events.

i)  Union.  Everyone agrees in principle to this – even members of Arab League, tho’ they daren’t admit it.  Reservations re Jerusalem &amp; line of frontier.  Also formal repetn of our assurances v. basis in Arab Pal. In peace-time.  Treaty does apply: we need only announce it.

ii)  de iure recognn of Israel.  We have bn. seekg. Opportunity to do this. Simultaneity with i) will be stabilising factor.  Reservations as in i).

Arab League likely to protest on both points.  But paper resistance only. Shdn’t be deterred by that.

iii)  Genl. decln will serve to re-inforce i) and ii) &amp; emphasise our desire tht. ques. betwn. Israel &amp; Arab be settled by negotn.



J.	Lone wolf policy.  No inference to Doms or U.S.  Tho’ right, this may 	arouse hostility.  Cdn’t we get U.S. agreement, in current discns?



K.Y.	Re U.S. – we have told them how we shd. react to what was coming.  They won’t object to our doing this.  Tho’ they prob. won’t follow suit.

	Comm. Govts – not consulted.



G.W.	Not even informed.  S. Afr. has done ii).  A. &amp; N.Z. wanted to be ahead of us.

	Problem:  we thght. Cab. shd. decide first because news value.  Our H. Commr. knows.

	They, in older Doms. only, can go in at once to inform Govts.



H.D.	Can we delay now?  This i) will be popular with all save Arab League.

	And ii) can’t be long delayed.  Govt. supporters anxious for this.



R.S.C.	Must be done together.  This is moment to do it.  ii) is important now we have come to econ. agreemt. with Israel.



A.B.	Events out running us have put i) before ii).  We mustn’t delay ii).

	On para. 4  Are rumours correct tht. U.K. pressed Jordan’s repve to acquiesce?



K.Y.	We gave him no official advice on that.  He may have consulted some of our people locally.



A.B.	Such advice wd. seem inconsistent with i).



R.S.C.	This isn’t separate peace.



A.B.	Will. F.O. check what advise was given locally?



H.McN.	Give A. &amp; N.Z. opportunity to do ii) simultaneously.  They withheld it before at our request.



			Agreed:  announce Thursday, to give time to notify Doms.

i) – iii) to be covered in single statement in H/C.

J.	Can we not get U.S. in accord?  Otherwise Arab League will attack us.



P.M.	U.S. are mud to Arab League already.  U.S. support won’t help us.  And what we are doing helps an Arab State.



R.S.C.	Anyhow U.S. haven’t recognised Jordan, I believe.



E.Sh.	C.O.S. are concerned about para. 18 (i).  Is it necessary to say this?

		If so, add “in peace-time”.



K.Y.	The qualificn is there – in para. 12.  Want to announce it, to help moderate in Israel.  Will be dragged out anyway.



			Agreed.





3.	    Haifa:  Pipe-Line.



A.B.	Cd. we have an early Discussion on Haifa.



H.W.	Surprised by E.B.’s statemt. in F. Aff. Debate – or by Eden’s.  Att. G. told me he hadn’t bn. consulted.



H.McN.	He was.



H.W.	Not a month ago.



K.Y.	It’s with them now. (L.O.’s)



H.McN	I referred it before Election.



P.M.	Bring it up when L.O.O. available.

				         [Exit K.Y.

				         [Enter H.G., B.

4.	    Transport Charges.



B.	Summd memo.  This further informn confirms my recommn that there must be either a subsidy or increased charges.  Want authy to publish this informn with my announcement – to educate opinion in H/C.



H.G.	Facts lead to concln tht. price increase can’t be avoided.  No hope of compensatg. revenue fr. roads.  No evce of inefficiency on rlways.

		Change due to changing pattern of consumer expenditure.

	Publn of facts.  Be careful of para. 11 because increased petrol duty – wd. give handle to road operators.

	M/T. mght. submit to Prodn Cttee periodically key figures showing progress of rlways.  



B.	Cd. apply to all socialised industries.

R.S.C.	They mght. go into C.S.O. Monthly Digest.

	I don’t favour subsidy.  I agree with increased charges.

	Views of M/Supply.  G.S. wd. not regard increase in steel prices as serious for U.K. steel prices are now as low as any in world.



H.W.	Effect on bldg. costs.



A.B.	Diff. to calculate.  Concerned about it.

	Attitude of T.U.C. will be affected by cumulative increases – petrol, rlways etc.,  In this election year.  We are “pursuing a policy of candide”.  Will rlways wages involve further rise in prices?



B.	After this, all decisions will be by Transport Rates Tribunal.  Won’t involve any political diffy for Govt.



			[All cried out:  surely not]



A.	See para. 6.  Fall in passenger recpts. is almost equal to current deficit.

		Commn is v. unsympathetic to consumer requiremts.	Need for searchg. investign into passenger side.  If we authorise this increase we shall have no chance to clip wings of these autocrats on Commn.



R.S.C.	Cabinet, not Commn, stopped the passenger services – because shortage of large coal.  Knew it wd. embarrass rlways in reln to consumers.



H.D.	Posn is blameworthy.  Rcpts. fr. passengers have dropped by £26 m. but expre has risen.  Trains are running empty.  Gap on passenger section is bigger than on freights.  Tribunal shd. have taken wider view covering passenger as well as freight.  Don’t like agreeing to this.

		Many marginal cases in wh. these increases will tip scale &amp; increase costs.



B.	In Nov. ’49 I recommended tht. Tribunal shd. be precluded fr. considerg. passenger fare increase.  For earlier increases had bn. disproportionate &amp; there were political objns.  Cab. endorsed that view.  Can’t go back on that now.



H.D.	But we shd. review passenger side – not to increase fares, but to reduce them or to cut costs.



B.	Limitn of capital investment has checked increased efficiency on pass. side. Petrol tax has added £6m to rlways costs.



G.T.	If this is our last intervention on charges, it’s political suicide for us to grant this increase.  Leave it all to Tribunal.



R.S.C.	Will take at least 1, prob. 2, years before Tribunal can do long-term charges structure.  And deficit by then wd. be £100 m.



H.McN.  }	What about a loan?  Road/rail integration is a new factor.  Cd. we not 

G.W.      }	  lend the money pro tem. 



R.S.C.	Commn won’t accept a loan to cover loss in running their business.  



H.G.	All other Socialised indies wd. ask for it, too.



H.McN.	Not unknown for commercial firm to carry a loss for 12/24 mos. if they see changes ahead by reason of re-organisation.



P.M.	No grounds for believing tht., any coming re-organn will remove this deficit.

		Remember also our own criticism of rlways for excessive capitalisation.



E.Sh.	Continuing deficit of £1/2 m. p. wk for 2 yrs. wd. be equal political headache.

		So wd. a subsidy to this socialised industry.

	We must put rlways into posn to pay their way.

	Publicise increased rlway charges in other countries.



H.M.	Must now authorise these increases.  But don’t regret delay, if it has taught Commn (&amp; prs. bds. of other socialised industies) tht. they must give Cab. proper amount of informn to justify their demand.  Even now, para. 7 is a bit jaunty.  Road/rail intergration isn’t evidently going to help us.

		Not all their fault – C. Licences, petrol tax etc.,  Commn must seek economies.

		On wages – Union shd. be tied up with man-power economy.  Cost of permanent way.



			Agreed:  Authorise increases.



W.W.	Endorsed that.
