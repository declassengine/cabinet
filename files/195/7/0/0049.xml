C.M. 53(49).				29th August, 1949.



	1.	Economic Situation.	[Enter  J.S.



	Devaluation.



P.M.	Saw R.S.C. &amp; others on his return.

	Devaluation.  Opinion has moved.  Many Ministers now favour.

		Unwise to do it in advance.  Shd. be part of settlement:  if

		only because we must know U.S. views.  Leave it to R.S.C. &amp;

		E.B. in light of W’ton talks.

		Anyway no final decn until after then.  No talk m’while.

	Canadian view.  Essential we shd. make positive proposals.  Can’t

		go cap in hand.



R.S.C.	Doubtful if we shd. gain much in dollar receipts w’out devaluation.

		But can’t stabilise £1 until devalued.

	If we can get stability &amp; promise tht. U.S. won’t defeat it’s effect 

		(e.g. by devaluing dollar or by import restns), I wd. be ready to

		do it &amp; consult them on amount.  Must avoid 2nd move or, by

		going too low, lose dollars.

	Thus, can’t decide in advance.  Want only authority to proceed so we

		cd. do it w’in few days after W’ton talks.



A.W.	See psychol. advantage qua f. opinion.  But won’t enable us to sell

		more in dollar markets.  Whisky sales must be 30% greater on

		devalued pound.



H.W.	No. Dollar price will be m’tained.



R.S.C.	Main gain:  dollar market will be more attractive to U.K. exporters.



H.W.	Illustrated this by reference to cotton.



A.W.	This means an export bonus.



R.S.C.	Must look after that by profits taxes.



A.B.	Devaln is no long-term remedy.

	Only purposes:  a)  preserve reserves pro tem.

			        b)  get stability &amp; confidence.

	Before Recess we were willing to consider it because (a).  Had no

		more in mind.  Support early action.



A.	Have possible consequences bn. considered?  Assurance of stability.



A.V.A.	Effect on long-term solution.  Must get over other argument of high-

		cost prodn.  Devaln will increase costs of raw materials.

		Faith not calculation?



H.W.	Press references – incldg. date.

		Also references to report by I.M.F. officials, on devaluation by

		other countries.



E.B.	All right if we keep quiet.  No speculation.

	U.S. turning ques. on to wider political context.

	U.S. price support for wheat.  W’out it, wheat wd. now be $1.  Yet

		we keep thousands of troops in Malaya to protect rubber prodn.

		They want our rubber (?).  They won’t accept our having price

		support for that.



A.W.	Expressed continuing doubt re devaluation.  Will U.S. adminn be able

		to resist pressure to keep out our exports at devalued prices?

	Wd prefer export subsidies.



H.W.	They are out because  a) contrary to internatl agreements.

			                  b) wd. invite tariff protn in U.S.



A.B.	They wd. invite legitimate counter-action in U.S.



R.S.C.	30% devaluation wd. mean 3½% increase in c/living eventually.



A.V.A.	That “won’t bear examination”.  Remain v. doubtful.



J.S.	Devaln has become inevitable.  Must be done decisively.  We shd. give

		R.S.C. now the authority he asks for.  Can’t hesitate over this.



P.M.	Yes – as part of a general settlement.  And tell Snyder &amp; Acheson

		privately at outset tht. we are willing to do it thus – with 

E.B.		concessions by them (e.g. on rigid bi-lateralism in Germany &amp;

		Japan) and readiness to talk about commodity agreemts.,

		non-discrimination, oil.

	Also E.C.A. financing:  synthetic rubber.

	Also political arguments re Malaya &amp; S.E.A.

	Are U.S. going to give any preference (if only by adminn) to Atlantic

		Pact countries?

	Our selling methods in U.S.  Are we exploiting West enough?  Room

		for gt. improvement here.  cf. Rank failure on films.

	Shipping.  Our invisible earnings.  Can we work out scheme by wh.,

		if U.S. is first attacked. sufficient shipping can be secured.

		Cd. we guarantee to make tonnage available in return for U.S.

		w’drawg. fr. peace time competn.  (Restns imposed on carrying

		of E.R.P. supplies – 50% to each country must go in U.S.

		bottoms, wh. can therefore carry at v. cheap rates going west.)

	All these things are bound up with devaluation.

	Not first time this has bn. considered.  In War Cab. I was doubtful

		about the $4 - £1. ratio.  Never thought we cd. sustain it above

		$3.50.  Nothing magical in $4.02.  In 1921 it fell to $3.12 - $3.60

		on a free exchange.  Our posn isn’t so strong now.



R.S.C.	V. serious if we have to pay back U.S. loan.  Warning.



A.B.	Painful to return to U.K. fr. abroad.  Humiliating.  Worst Press abroad

		we have ever had.  Tactics wrong.  We cd. have exported this 

		crisis.  We didn’t.  Now our prestige is v. low.  Due to

		manoeuvre, not facts.  And our Party prestige is even lower.

		Swing back to Catholic reaction in Europe.  Dangerous qua

		resistance to Communism – only answer to wh. was Third Force.

		This is now disappearing.  cf. German elections.

	Our case isn’t stated to world at all.

	Our plight is direct consequence of political manipulation by U.S.A.

		Not due to division of labour between U.S. &amp; Europe.  Purpose

		of trade is free exchange.  Trouble must be that U.S. prices are 

		too high.

	Disgraceful tht. we shd. be losing £100 m. p.a. on oil.  Case goes by 

		default.  No one complains openly about non-discrimination.



E.B.	We accepted it in Loan.



A.B.	Under duress.

	We must tell U.S. that this won’t do.  Unbearable for me to go on

		holding my tongue about this.  Same about Can. wheat.  Our

		troubles due to U.S. &amp; Canadian extortions.

	There is no such thing as free economy in world.  U.S. &amp; Canada

		aren’t running a free economy.

	We have allowed ourselves &amp; our Party to be put on the spot because

		we haven’t hit out &amp; exposed this situation.

	Unity of Cabinet &amp; Party will be impaired if we continue to allow the

		Socialist case to go by default.

	Fatal if any redns in Govt. expre (necessary in any event) were 

		associated with W’ton talks.  Irrelevant to dollar issue.

		Ty. officials shd. be curbed.



E.B.	Only economy point I have discussed with U.S. is tht. as they have 

		cut vote for ????? defence by 50% we must follow suit in

		our contribn.



A.B.	We have never stated Br. “Marshall Aid” since 1945.



R.S.C.	Yes – on several occasions.  Press Conference.



E.B.	Must have come out clearly enough because W.S.C. denounced at 

		W’ton.



A.B.	Well:  let’s get out a pamphlet &amp; put it across in Europe.



P.M.	Very well.



A.B.	Give all support I can to colleagues who are going to carry out a 

		v. difficult negotiation.

E.B.	Prestige in Europe.  We know we haven’t any in Italy.

	Outburst in France recently – due to Alphand being i/c F.O.!

	Slip-up in O.E.E.C. – putting our bid up from $950 m. to 1100 or so.

		That was most ill-advised.

		Yet 3 Scandinavians went to Snoy &amp; said they wdn’t take their

		allocations unless ours was increased to around $960 m.

	Apart from the froth, however, Britain’s prestige stands high among

		the common people of Europe.

	On publicity.  I decided to let it ride, avoid recrimination, in U.S.

		Believed U.S. Press wd. turn.  It is beginning to do so.



					          [Enter  H.G.    

A.	E.B.’s points.  Get the best out of them as part of bargain.

	But will you get agreemt. on all these by 18/9.



R.S.C.	Shan’t make a hard bargain.  Depends on atmosphere.  If we are 

		satisfied they are in mood to help, we shd. be justified in

		acting on devaluation.



E.B.	Never believed we cd. get straight until 1952.

	Sole ques. now:  can we avoid recurring U.S. crises which prevent us		from settling down to it?



A.W.	U.S. may raise ques. of our internal economy.

	Hope internal ques. will not be allowed in W’ton talks.



A.B.	Para. 15.



H.G.	Devaluation paras. were deleted from this passage.



C.J.	Devaln will increase c/living in Colonies.

	Can we compensate ourselves by increased earnings?



R.S.C.	They don’t rely on dollar foods.  Shdn’t be increased c/living in

		Colonies.

			Agreed:  on Devaluation.



	C.P.(49) 175.   Summary of Recommendations.



R.S.C.	I.	(b)	Retain conceptn of Comm. as economic unit.  This shd. be

		added, or understood.

	II.	U.K. Action.



H.G.	V. misleading because omission of reference to devaluation.

	I think it desirable, when devaluation is announced, to say somethg.		re redns of expre.  Not because Press or U.S. demand it.  But

		because inflationary pressures will be much increased by devaln.

		For (altho’ credit policy can help) it’s Budgetary policy wh. 

		mainly controls inflation.  1948 Budget, deflationary, much



		helped our recovery.  Dilemma:  increase taxation or reduce 

		expendre.  Political decision which you do.



A.B.	Timing is v. awkward.

	Whatever you say, devaln will be repd as result of agreemt. with U.S.		That is wrong context in wh. to announce cuts.

	We must do all that’s necessary to combat inflation.  But we can 

		announce as necessary.



R.S.C.	Must tell public effects of devaluation – includg. rise in c/living.



A.B.	It may not rise.



E.B.	It didn’t before.



A.B.	Wd make M/L. position impossible.



E.B.	In any discns in W’ton, don’t mention anything we may have to do

		internally.  Must protect ourselves v. U.S. interference.

	On public expendre, we ought to act.  As P.M. has done.  (cf. Report on

		gang-labour in Agriculture.)  But that’s our own business.

	Effect of devaluation on c/living.  In 1931 it went down.  And as T.U.

		leader I got off the c/living link and my wages went up as c/living

		went down.

		Don’t go further than:  “at the worst it won’t go up more than 		3½%”.

	Won’t Canada have to bring wheat prices down?



A.W.	“Govt” expenditure includes much economical transfer from l.a. to

		central Govt.

	“The nation’s expenditure”, if you like.  But much saving shd. come

		from private individuals.



A.	What we do internally shd. form no part of W’ton discussions.

			Agreed on II.             {  No mention in W’ton talks.

		See however x/ overleaf.   {  No announcement of cuts in connn

			                                  {  with the W’ton decisions.



J.S.	Why no mention in II of telling Canada we wdn’t renew contracts

		save for sterling?



P.M.	Decision of 12/8.  Not before W’ton talks.



J.S.	But still shd. be taken up later.



E.B.	And warning given to Abbott at W’ton.



H.W.	Substitute for II.  Cab. decision that urgent considn shd. be given to

                   x/		means of combating any inflationary pressure that may develop.

		Plus para. 10(ii).

			Agreed at x/.

	III to IV approved w’out comment.



R.S.C.	VII.	Will meet their Ambassadors in W’ton.



P.M.	Will keep in touch with progress of talks – small group H.W., H.G.

		&amp; D.J.                   (No dissent).



A.	Appendix A. (f).

		Proposal to disallow £25 cash wd. kill emigration to Canada.

		Ready to discuss dollar loss arising from remittances.  But

		that particular proposal wdn’t do at all.





	2.	Wages Policy:  Distributive Trades.



P.M.	Have re-considered.  Talked with E.B. &amp; Tewson.



G.A.I.	Union’s propose to table emergency resoln at Congress.

	And T.U.C. also inclined to take it up.

	Such action wd. cut at roots of machinery.  We shd. be freezing wages

		at low level when we haven’t bn. able to do it for much higher

		wages.

	Proposals have bn. referred back several times – e.g. to get uniformity

		&amp; we have got it.

	If I refer back, they will re-submit with a diff. figure.  And if I then 

		confirm, I shall be in posn of fixing wages.

	V. delicate situation.



E.B.	Went into this at P.M.’s request.

	Fundamental principle.   (Negotns have bn. going on a long time:

		M/L. might have bn. criticised for delays – wd. have bn.

		unofficial strikes from many other industries.)

	Winders.  We have bn. trying to force them to arbitration.  Yet here

		we shd. be refusing to confirm finding of statutory body.

	On merits:  it puts no-one above £5 a week.  Increase 3/= to 9/= and

		the 9/= is only in book-selling.

	My advice:  authorise them one by one.

	Don’t accept view tht. this wd. lead to increased profit margins.

		Make them pay higher wages by greater efficiency.  At least

		make them establish a case for increased margins.



R.S.C.	Get it out of the way before devaluation because may then have to 

		have a wage freeze. And wd. be awkward to have to make 

		exceptns.



			Discussion to be resumed.
