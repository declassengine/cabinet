H.M.	Govt. will reject all H/L amendmts of substance. 

	H/L. will pass on 20/7.  H/C. will disagree on 25/7.  H/L will insist on vesting date 27/7.  H/C will consider this on 28/7.  Bill will then be lost on that day if no agreed amendment is found.

	Shd. we a) hold over to autumn  b) sit on into August.

	I wouldn’t mind a).



A.B.	The amendmt has brought it to an issue.  Mistake to do b).



A.	Support a) rather than b).  But wd. prefer to dispose of it before Recess.



	Pensions – Debate in H/L. (Wavill) on Wednesday.



A.	Will be diff. to defend.  Can we do something.



N.B.	It is non S/S. men who had no right to retire on propte pension.

		We agreed with I/P at a date after transfer of power:  but that agreemt. did not apply retrospectively.  And these (few) are regarded as men who “ran out”.

	Hoped Ty. cd. handle ex gratia.



P.M.	Get A., N.B. and Ty. to consider.

A.B.	We have arranged for back benchers to raise ques. wtr. this is same Bill.

		Also same point now covered in N.H. Amendmt Bill – or rather that Bill cd. carry amendmt. covering this Bill.

	Even if this doesn’t come off, we can talk it out.



	Hairdressers Bill



C.E.	Little evidence tht. Govt. supporters will support our opposn to Bill.



H.M.	Must get at least some talk on the Bill.

				[Enter G.I., Hall

	

2.	    General Election.



P.M.	Ministers shd. be careful to avoid saying anything wh. might imply they know when Election will be.  Any time during next 12 months.

		Will be misconstrued.

	Say:  be ready at any time.  Don’t suggest it’s coming early.

	Surrey &amp; R. not working.  S.W. India &amp; Millwall are working.  Y’day Stevedores Union met:  were to order men to go back on all ships. But employers had made it known they wdn’t call men unless willing to work Canadian ships – &amp; put it into opn on Wed. morning.  This angered Stevedores &amp; Executive cdn’t get men to agree.

	No risk of food perishing for several days.  Energy Cttee can watch it.



	Railways.



	M/L. in touch with all Rlwy. Unions because any wage settlement will affect some of their members.

	R.E.C. still willing to hold mtg. to-day.  But took Figgins  ½ hour to say he was still negotiating.

	Annual genl. mtg. of N.U.R. next Monday.  A new body – diff. from that wh. took “go slow” decision.

	Must therefore find means of preventg. issue of circulars instructg. men to go slow.

	Mtg. of R.E.C. &amp; Unions 2.30 to-day.

	Possible solutions

		a) M/L to assist both parties at the request of both.

		b) R.E.C. to say agreement is ended.

E.B.	Injustice to lower-paid men.

				[Enter Solr. Genl.



4.	    Succession to the Crown Act.



H.M.	Useful to have these public men on bodies like G.M.C.

	But point has bn taken &amp; Att.Genl. rules then is a breach.

	Other cases too.  { Diamond M.P. on Nurses Council.

			          { 2 M.P.’s on Vets. Council.

	All rather a mess.



P.M.	Why didn’t official spot this?



H.M.	I must take the responsibility.  No reason to think then wd. be trouble because M.P.’s had previously sat unchallenged.



A.B.	What about the future?



J.	Dennis Herbert Report.  I was asked to handle it.  ???? drafted a Bill: but (1943) wanted to p’pone introdn because a number of new offices were likely to be created.  Nothing was done.  Chaotic situation – 

	Recommend we shd. resume where we left off in ’43.  Make Parly.

	Counsel work on it in vacation.



E.B.	What about Council of Europe?  



Solr.Genl.  	We have advised it isn’t an office – tho’ with some hesitation.

	Really impossible to be sure of effect of the Act.

	A no. of points of policy need considn:  support fresh enquiry by Parlt.



			Agreed:  Introduce Indemnity Bill.

			                     L.P. to consider what shd. be done on the general

5.	    Civil Servants and Industrial Disputes.



C.E.	As in memo.

	Anomalous position.

	Difference of opinion on Emergencies Cttee.



W.P.	Ques. arose in 1926.  And Govt. agreed they shd. not be asked to do this. Strong precedent behind P.W.U.

	Believe we can deal with situation by volunteers.  Favour course (2).



A.B.	Can’t follow this.  How wd. you run voluntary service, side by side with normal G.P.O. services?



W.P.	Get the volunteers from P.O. – first, at any rate.

G.A.I.	Why compare 1926 with 1949?

	See no reason why P.O. shdn’t make their chaps do the job.

	Don’t discuss it with them at all.  Require them to do what is their ordinary work



B.	Support G.A.I.  Over road transport as a whole, length of journey will be extended.



A.W.	Sympathise with P.M.G. but support G.A.I. qua ordinary work.

	Suggest, however, that long journey mails by road be started before strike begins.



			Agreed:  Support G.A.I.

			                                                [Exit W.P. &amp; Barnes, Gl.Hall

J.	Norway Foreign Minister realises it must come to the Court.  He can do no more.





7.	    Social Services in Western Europe.

				[Exit Solr. Genl.

E.B.	As in memo.                                                          [Enter H.H.M. &amp; J.G.



J.G.	Agreed.



A.B.	Hope we shall press for more progress on the Health side.  Know it isn’t easy.  But we are giving v. tangible benefits to visitors from Europe.



E.B.	Put in a memo. [ to the official Cttee].  Then Ministerial Cttee if necessary.



P.M.	Health Services benefits for foreigners.  Let us have memo. on facts &amp; wtr. we boast or apologise.
