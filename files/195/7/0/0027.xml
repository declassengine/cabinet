		1.	Council of Europe.			[Enter Gl. Hall., Att.Genl.



E.B.	Most points cleared.

	Legal point (R.S.C.) on general agreement, as well as ⅔ majority.



J.	Nothing in this point.

	If there were ….” not less than ⅔ majority” wd. do it.



Att.G.	Adhere to words of U.N. Charter.

	Agreed : no change.



E.B.	Greece and Turkey.  Fr. opposed this strenuously.  Now, on Fri. suggd invitg. them before constn adopted.  Too late.  We can resolve to invite them and then go on to sign.  Otherwise, everything will be held up.



P.M.	Basis of U.K. repn ?  When are we going to decide?



E.B.	That is a ques. for U.K. Cab.



H.M.	Profl betwn. Parties in H/C.

	(Shall have debate on Wed/Thurs. on Atlantic Pact).



E.B.	As soon as this is signed, W. Paper will be tabled – prob. on Thursday.



P.M.	Shall at once be asked our view on U.K. Repn.



E.B.	For Assembly, base it on H/C. repn.



H.M.	H/L. may want to come in on this.



E.B.	P.M. and H.M. shd. decide this – not my job.



H.M.	Must decide in principle now wthr. Govt. collars whole repn or other Parties are to be represented.



P.M. &amp; H.M.	Must give Repn to others.



H.D.	Case for giving Oppn. Parties some repn.  But don’t make it rigidly propl and don’t give H/L. any.

	Leave it open to bring in people who aren’t members of Parlt. at all.

	Use a formula saying some other people will be included.	



P.M.	If you depart fr. “elected persons” you will get into trouble with Wales, Scotland, H/Lords etc.



J.	Allow 3 Parties to nominate to a given no. of vacancies.



E.B.	Announce merely “a no. of repves’ of all Parties and work it out thro’ usual channels.  After Govt. Cttee.



P.M.	Depart fr. Parties in H/C. and you get troubles eg. nos. voting in Elections, special interests etc.,



N.B.	Stick to H/C.  Even there, other Govts. wd. have diffty. because their Opposns are Comm. or Fascist.  



P.M. 	Can make it plain we exclude non-democratic Parties.



A.W.	Wales and Scotland will demand repn – wthr. thro’ H/C. or otherwise I don’t care.  But some repn is essential so nationalist movemts. will be fanned.

	Tom Johnston wd. have bn. a v. useful member.  But don’t press point.



P.M.	That’s why I want it confined to H/C. elected persons.



	Agreed : H.M. to submit memo. for Thursdays’ Cabinet.



E.B.  	Provide tht. delegn shd. always include repves of Wales and Scotland. 



H.M. 	Meet it w’out a specific rule.  What of N.I. Not sure about H/Lds.





		2.	Austria : Political Parties.



E.B.	Cab. agreed this was ques. for Austria.

	Fr. and U.S. won’t agree – say it plays into hands of Comms.

	P.Q. today : asked p’pone because M/Interior seems to have settled matter w’out us.  Can’t find out by this p.m. what has happened.



H.M.	If we can’t get embargo removed, we shall be in diffy. because our people will want to know what our view was.  Wd. E.B. agree to disclose that, tho’ it involves disclosing tht. Fr. and U.S. wdn’t agree with us.



E.B.	Don’t want to disclose that.  Needn’t, if Helmer is right in view that embargo isn’t binding.  He can then get own way w’out Allied consent.





		3.	Germany.  Blockade of Berlin.



E.B.	Talks Malik/Jessup.  Must be careful not to demoralise W. Germany.

	K’patrick has bn. in G. : opinion there is steady.  They are going ahead with W. Govt.

	Shd. be glad to see blockade lifted – so long as doesn’t prejudice establishmt. of W. Germany.

	R. move is first victory for Atlantic Pact + air-lift.

	Fr. are annoying.  Won’t ratify Pact until 20th June.

	Must be specially careful on one thing. (Tel. re McNeil &amp; Lie – conversation with Gromyko and Rusk (State Dpt. Russian desk).

	Told McN to keep out of it altogether – crossing wires with Malik/Jessup discns. 

	My concln : 2 sections in Politburo, narrowly divided : one wants to settle with West + is in momentary ascendancy.  Gromyko spks for Molotov : and he therefore may still be wanting to fight the West.  May therefore be reversal of policy at any moment.

	Keep this in mind – caution  - for Labour supporters in H/C.



H.W.	R. peace offensive is being tried on fronts other than Berlin.

	Overtures on trade.  Agree to supply nearly all our requests.

	Dropped all their demands.



E.B.	Want Dpts. to treat R. trade arrangemts. more normally.  Don’t allow our purchase from R. sources to be spot lighted.  P.M. shd. issue instns. on this.   cf. salmon.



N.B.	Endorsed. Advertising eastern agreemts,  just to please own party.

	[Pact. Canada has ratified – all Parties.  Pearson said he hoped we

	[wd realise what a v. gt. advance this represents in Canadian opinion.



H.W.	On trade point, we do play this line.

	Fact is tht. Press are more interested in R. than in other countries.	



P.M.  	I will circulate a note on trade point.





		4.	International Labour Convention.

(a)  Freedom to Associate and Right to Organise.



G.A.I.	Involves no change in U.K. law.

	Form of conventn due to efforts of T.U.C. repve.

	Art. 8 is safeguard.

	N. Ireland.  I agree that letter may be shortened and omit argument.



Att.G.	First 3 paras wd. suffice. 



J. 	I agree.



G.T.	Wd. provoke awkward discn over U.S. Federal system.  Harmful to I.L.O. and to ourselves.



E.B.	I agree to shorter form.



	Agreed : short form of notification.



H.M.	Art. 2. Mayn’t this cramp our style?

	N.C.B. Staff Assocn: Bd. is refusing to recognise this and is insisting on N.U. Clerks.

	Will M/L. agree tht. this is consistent with Art. 2.

	L.a.’s are sometimes forced to do this.

	Encourages break away Unions.

	These moral principles trip you up.



Att.G.	Doesn’t go beyond existg. law.

	Guards v. evil of country have only State recognised unions.

	Nothg. here to compel Govt. or employers negotiatg. with any particular union.



P.M.	Art. 2 is a valueless right – if employee is sacked because he has joined another union.



E.B.	Always opposed 100% Unionism.  Don’t get real members that way.

	Can’t overcome reluctance of workers to work together with others.

	This doesn’t affect us seriously.



G.T.	Doesn’t matter.

	Can admit a right to organise – tho’ they mayn’t have any negotiating power.



H.M.	Wd. Art. 5 sanctify internatl cartel?



J.	Hardly. cf. Art.10.

	Arts. 3(2) and 11 cd. be pleaded in argument : but don’t operate to prevent employer from sackg. a man who has joined break away Union.



E.B.	You will have trouble in Parlt.  Much of this was in 1927 Act.  And we shall be asked searching ques.



G.B.?	Haven’t you admitted T.U. is a body which can be sued?



G.A.I.	I think not.



Att.G.	This represents existg. law in U.K.



H.M.	But wd. or might fetter you in amending law eg. to meet real threat of Comm. unions.



Att.G.	Cd. then denounce the Convention.



	C.P. (49)81 approved.





(b)   Organisation of Employment Service.



G.A.I.	As in memo.



H.M.	Art. 12(c).  Is that safe?  Cd. you send a girl to work at coal face?

G.A.I.	Saved by work “itself”.  The organisation doesn’t discriminate.



E.B.	The law itself prevents employmt. of women in certain occupations.



Att.G.	Govt. (or employer) can discriminate.  Emplt. Service can’t.





		5.	Wages Policy. Railways Application.



P.M.	What has M/L. said to railwaymen.



G.A.I.	I saw them and told them (confirmg. by letter) tht. arbitn. was over and no more cd. be done.

	Had ascertained, however, tht. Rlways were not excludg. negotn on a new proposal.  I told them that, in conversn in H/C.



P.M.	Why?  Our policy is for arbitratn and that was over.



G.A.I.	Said I wdn’t discuss merits.

	But clear that. lower paid workers are under paid.  Tried to get them on to that, rather than general rate.

	Didn’t want a dispute.

	If they are struck, they wd. gain public sympathy.

	My object was to get them talking again.	

	Now referred back to Executive, who can negotiate quietly.

	Discouraged them fr. askg. for a particular figure.



P.M.	When we have had decn on arbitn, Unions shdn’t feel they can get round it by running to M/Labour.



E.B.	Flat rate increases are mistake.

	Unions shd. be ready to go for lower paid only.

	Govt. can’t however afford to seem opposed to adjustmts. of lower paid workers on railways.



G.A.I.	Awkward b’ground.

	New Secy. is politically doubtful.

	He tied in 4 groups.  Told him he must go on separately.

	The other 2 Unions wdn’t join him.

	Rlway. Executive made an offer to certain sectns.  That encouraged him to go on.  Insisted on its going thro’ recognised machinery – delay since June ’48 – is irritatg. the men.

	Figgins is out to cause us mischief.





		6.	May Day Demonstrations.



C.E.	Press report.

	Diffies not v. gt.  No organised effort to contravene Order prohibitg. processns.  Sporadic groups.

	Police prevented it – no injuries.
