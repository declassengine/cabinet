C.M. 38(49).				26th May, 1949.



	1.	Parliament.                                [Enter  W.W., C.M., A.H. and H.



H.M.	Business for next week.

	Superannuation Bill.

		Amendmt. carried in Cttee wh. will cost £1m. rising to £5.

		R.S.C. ready to make it retrospective to passing of Bill.

		Dangerous to let Cttees carry such amendmts.  Fin. Resn was

		widely drawn.

	Irish Bill Divisions.  Tribute to Whips – v. diff. situation, well

		handled.



	H/Lords.   Steel Bill.

A.	Unlikely to insist on any amendmts save the one to p’pone opn of

		Bill.  Have said “we take note.”



H.D.	Govt. speakers weren’t impressive.  Kershaw (?) even recommended

		giving way.



A.	Our men aren’t anxious to speak.

	All ablest supporters are off on other jobs.



	Ireland Bill.

J.	Diffies.  Simon’s 3 amendmts:  will be resisted.  May be voted down.





	2.	Canadian Seamen’s Strike.



C.E.	Awkward sitn at Avonmouth.

	Em. Cttee discussed y’day – 8 Ministers took decision.  But M/L. got

		Deakin last night who asked us to delay decision.  Suspended

		pending Cab. to-day.

	Dispute in Canada between seamen &amp; employers:  went to 

		arbitration:  in C. law remains for parties to decide wtr. to accept

		arbitral award &amp; Seamen’s Union rejected it for e. seaboard.  

		Crews have therefore gone on strike here.  Then another Union

		provided crews wh. members of T. &amp; G.W. Union regard as 

		blacklegs &amp; won’t work with them.

	Montreal City – in Avonmouth – with S.I.U. crew.  Dockers won’t 

		work it.  Employers say no other ship shall be worked until this

		is a lock-out.  Also a ship with 13.000 t. bananas in Avonmouth

		likely to go off fr. to-day.  Cttee decided employers shd. be 

		pressed to allow this ship to be worked, by volunteers from 

		T. &amp; G.W.U.

	Deakin at first said if any other ship touched before M. City it wd.

		be surrender to unoffl. strikers &amp; wd. undermine authy of 

		employers &amp; Union.

	H’to no diffy. in getting food ships worked.  New posn therefore.

	D. says if we do this no other Can. ship will be worked anywhere

		if members of T. &amp; G.W.U. think it has a scab crew.

	Told D. he was trying to dictate to Govt.

	Eventually moved him some way.  There is a mtg. this a.m.  (The

		Union and employers are united v. unoffl. strikers.)  He will

		ask to-day for volunteers to work banana ship.  Read extract

		fr. y’day’s Times.  Means Govt. will have to ask employers to

		agree:  if D. gets volunteers to do it.

	G.A.I. in b’cast said “Govt. wd. not tolerate repetn of unofficial strike

		in docks”.

	Efforts to spread the strike.

	Asked M/T. to submit genl. memo. to Cabinet on sitn in docks.

	On this case, recommend Govt. shd. ask employers to agree.



G.A.I.	View of Cttee tht. employers must relax “lock out” &amp; leave Can. ships

		to be settled separately.  D. thinks, however, this wd. = surrender

		to unoffl. strikers &amp; spread the trouble.

	Mtg. at 11 a.m. is to try to get formula, wh. will enable Can. ships to be

		worked.  If that succeeds, all’s well.  C.E.’s proposal comes in

		if it doesn’t.



A.V.A.	If mil. labour had to be used, we cdn’t provide it at all ports.



R.S.C.	The Can. Union is Comm.- controlled.



N.B.	They have no case on merits.  Union was repd on arbitral Board.

		Didn’t try to apply strike to coasters.  Was attempt to apply it

		only to Marshall Aid ships.  Strike here is illegal under Can.

		law – genl. principle tht. ships shd. be worked home before

		strike operates.  I.S.U. isn’t Comm:  and our dockers are backing 

		wrong side.



N.B.	Cdn’t this be put over – as cold-war story.



			Agreed:  C.E.’s proposal approved.



A.B.	Genl. situation v. unsatisf.  We have no idea of keeping initiative

		in cold war.  Shd. have standing Cttee with T.U.C. to organise

		opposn to Comm. activities.



P.M.	I am considering this sort of suggn.  Think it shd. be taken up

		with T.U.C.

	Favour a broadcast.

 

H.M.	No diffy. if it’s a Ministerial b’cast.



G.A.I.	Better a T.U. figure e.g. V. Feather or Fred Lee.  On Regional p’mme.

		Lee has just returned fr. Canada.



A.B.	Genl. pamphlet for dockers about Comm. machinations.



P.M.		Agreed.  [Who shd. do this?]   M/L. and C.O.I.

			Agreed:  as above.

			                                           [Exit  W.W.

			                                           [Enter  C.O.S., Nye, Macdonald,

			                                                       Ritchie.

	3.	Hong Kong.



P.M.	Expld memo.

	Earlier Cab. view – no long-term decn.  Still think that right.

		But not inconsistent with policy of “resistg. aggression.”

	Re-inforcemt. means commitmt &amp; may be long-drawn out.

	Comm. moral support.  Likely from older Govts.  From now, prs.

		best hope is tht. they will keep quiet.  U.S. – not known what

		their attitude might be.

	Material help.  Australia shd. help.

	First discuss general policy.



R.S.C.	Agree we shd. resist aggression.  But what eventual result.  Not a 

		situation in wh. decisive result can be obtd.  What about a long

		siege.  Cd. we support popn indefinitely?



C.J.	Food supplies built up.  Water wd. be a problem, if leased 

		territories went.



R.S.C.	I assume you hold those.  But can we support indefinitely?



C.A.S.	Boycott is possibility.  But mil. blockade isn’t possible.



A.B.	Point of staying in H. Kong?  To trade with China.  Impossible if

		China is hostile.  Militarily imposs. to stay unless China 

		acquiesces.

	Policy must therefore be dependent of getting China’s acquiescence.

		Mustn’t therefore take military action wh. wd. outrage China.

	How cd. we m’tain H.K. at end of this long l/c.  And, even if we cd.,

		what wd. be the point if no trade.

	Don’t want to regard attack on H.K. as aggression.  Cd. we, even?

		If attack is by fellow-countrymen of inhabitants.



M.M.	Local popn.  Govr. says if we make our posn clear trouble fr. w’in

		can be reduced to minimum.

	Trade.  Value cuts both ways.  Blockage for v. long wd. be diff. –

		tho’ ready to put up with it for many months.  But equally diff.

		for China – wh. depends v. largely on imports thro’ H. Kong.

		Comm. posn in S. China will be precarious anyway.



A.W.	Rpt. in Press this a.m. tht. U.S. consultg. 40 countries re recognition &amp;

		making retentn of H.K. a condition.



N.B.	H.K. important moral factor in S.E.A. situation.  To go out now wd. be

		regarded as major reverse.

	A stand wd. not be regarded as Colonialism because B. action in 

		India.  Cd be put over as stand v. Commn.



A.B.	How can we assemble context in wh. Ch. Comm. Govt. can acquiesce

		in our remaining in H. Kong?  Play for time.  Don’t make H.K. a

		prestige point for them too.

	Deprecate therefore a unilateral decln by U.K.  Multi-lateral demarche

		by as many Govts. as possible.

	No prestige point in bleeding to death in H. Kong.



C.M.	We shd. agree to doing everything quietly.

	But attack isn’t more likely to be made because we prepare for it.

	Direct attack is least likely developmt.  We shd. reduce risk of it by

		being prepared.

	Trade is important.  But also ques. where, if it all, we make a stand in

		F/East?  Might it not be worse for us to have to do so in S.E.A.?

		E.B. wd. say:  face it in H. Kong.



P.M.	No suggn of blazing challenge to Chinese Govt.

	Less chance of attack if we are prepared.

	Need for Comm. support.

	Position in S.E.A. generally.



C.A.S.	H.K. sitn directly linked with S.E.A. sitn.   If we are firm there, we

		strengthen all round.  If we aren’t Siam Burma Malaya will all

		go bad.  V. similar to Berlin.  If we had given way W. Europ.

		front v. Commn wd. have crumbled.

	Defence.  Two threats.  Internal:  complicated by influx of refugees.

		External:  diff. to be sure what scale of attack is possble.  These

		re-inforcemts. wd. reduce internal threat &amp; wd. enable external

		threat to be resisted.



H.D.	Can influx of refugees be checked?



M.M.	In a situation of blockade – yes.  Ready to introduce measures when

		time is appropte.  Frontier cdn’t be sealed w’out serious 

		interference with trade.



R.S.C.	Cdn’t stop it in 1940.



M.M.	Govt. believe they cd. stop a flood tho’ not a trickle.



A.B.	All agreed want to remain in H.K.

	Main purpose – trade.  Can only have trade with Ch. Govt.

		acquiescent.

	Decided last time not to make long-term statemts.



P.M.	a)	Proposed only to say “will defend v. aggression”.

	b)	Let deeds (re-inforcements) speak for themselves.



A.	H/L. will ask:  are you going to stay?



A.B.	Don’t commit ourselves to this policy until we have assured 

		ourselves of support from other countries – as many as possible.



P.M.	Memo. contemplates that.  No decision announced – tho’ taken as a

		basis for military preliminaries – until consultn with other

		countries has bn. completed.



R.S.C.	Going back to my 1st point:  is this preliminy to negotiatg. an

		accommn with Ch. Comms?  For I don’t believe we can stay

		in H.K. indefinitely if Ch. Comms. are hostile.

	Can Comms. be less nationalist than Kuomingtang.

	Don’t oppose main theme of memo.  But must think out long-term

		policy.



P.M.	Assumes any Ch. Govt. wd. have to keep trade channels open.

	They must talk against H. Kong.  But will they insist in acting upon

		that line of talk.



R.S.C.	Suppose U.S. ask our long-term intentns?  What do we answer?



C.I.G.S.	Agree with A.B.  Trade is object.  But you won’t come to any 

		agreemt. with Ch. Govt. if you allow them to occupy H. Kong.

		first.  Some chance pres. if you negotiate from a firm posn.  No

		chance at all if you let H. Kong go, out of weakness.

	“Why defend a corpse?”  Not true.  H.K. trade dead in ’45.  But now

		about as flourishing as any part of B. trade.

		Blockade.  Even if trade is stopped for a time, hurts both sides

		equally, and after a time life comes back to trade.

	C.O.S. don’t want to provoke Ch. Govt. &amp; do want to enlist other

		countries support.  But if you are going to re-inforce H.K. you

		must do it now.  Otherwise too little and too late.’



H.D.	Don’t want to go into this alone.  Consultns with Comm. Govts.



J.	Approach to U.S. shd. be v. discreet.



A.N.	India.  Chances of public support v. poor.  a) Anti-Colonial policy.

		He will say our presence in H.K. is insult to Asian peoples.

	   b)	Fr. and Portuguese possns in Pondicherri &amp; Goa.  He won’t want

		to make it diff. for him to oppose their re-inforcing those.

	   c)	Not joining either e. or w. blocs.  April decln criticised only on

		ground tht. it limits India’s freedom of action in internatl affairs.

		Supporters nervous of this.  If w’in a month he came out in

		support of our actn in H.K. critics wd. say “there you are”.

	Best hope therefore is that he will keep his mouth shut.

	On internal unrest, he prob. will.  But on external attack, it wd. be by

		Ch. Govt. &amp; he wd. find it diff. to keep silent.



	Form of decln.  Risk that it will be construed as challenge to wh. there

		must be a reply.



N.B.	Don’t want a decln.



M.M.	From local pt. view – important thing is decision &amp; arrival of 

		re-inforcemts.  Decln wd. have additional value &amp; earlier

		the better.



A.B.	“We are sending further re-inforcemts. in pursuance of earlier 

		decisions.”



M.M.	I accept posn tht. terms &amp; timing of decln turns on wider considns

		rather than local.



A.N.	From India pt. view, less said the better.



P.M.	Can we decide tht. we will defend H.K. v. aggression.

		Don’t regard it as fortress – mainly trade.

		Then approach Comm. Govts.  No use askg. Nehru to 

	         make positive decln.  Strong case for demanding 

		material help from Australia.

		Put conclns as in draft.	Agreed.

	Consultn with U.S.A.   :   By E.B. in Paris.

        

P.M.  	Agreed.



	Re-inforcements.



H.D.	Can you spare Guards Brigade fr. Malaya.



R.	Not before September.  Shd. be O.K. by then.



A.H.	I am opposed to despatch of any Hornets from U.K.  No decn until

		all means of getting alternatives are exhausted.



P.M.	Disposed to agree.



C.A.S.	If you don’t decide to send Hornets now, shan’t have the Forces

		needed in time.



A.H.	Get Australians to send.



P.M.	A.H. must raise this again, if he must, in Defence Cttee.



	Shipping.



A.V.A.	Explained plans.  Involve Australian help.





	Hong-Kong Dollar.



R.S.C.	Can’t give open-ended agreemt.

	Will, however, send B/E. expert to assist Govr.



	Class A of Army Reserve.



R.S.C.	Serious reflectn on our strength, with nearly 400.000 men in Army.



A.B.	Politically v. inexpedient to do this.



H.D.	Endorsed that view.



P.M.	Will re-consider in Def. Cttee.





	Water Supplies.



R.	Enough for popn &amp; increased garrison.  Vulnerable.  Rationing needed

		at end of dry weather even now.



M.M.	We shall be defendg. leased territories.
