		1.	Parliament.				[Enter E.Sh. A.H. W.W.



H.M.	Business for next week, in H/C.



A.	Convn. with Salisbury.  Want Ireland Bill by 19/5.  Will then pass by Whitsun.



W.W.	That is p’mme.



A.	Steel Bill – 2 day Debate : will give 2nd Rdg.  therefore arranging for Cttee. stage (Opposn.)

	Need H/L. debate Atl. Pact.



P.M.	Think not. Whips to consider precedents.

	Salisbury’s Motion on P.M.M.



A.	Later.





		2.	Hong Kong.			[Enter C.O.S., H. Callaghan,

							 Listowel, E.E.B.



C.A.S.	a) internal unrest. b) refugees. c) aggression fr. outside.

	To meet those reinforcements needed now.

	a) local stops, police, regn of foreigners.

	But no AA. defence : land and air forces inadequate even for a).

	Recommend compln. of brigade group.  Air : fighter squadr. fr. Malaya already arranged : now proposed double it to 16 aircraft for both air defence and support land/forces – composite.  Cruiser being sent.

	Major threat fr. mainland is diff.  For actual warfare, another Divn. fr. U.K. involvg. reserve call-up + 2 addl. squadrons + carrier.



A.V.A.	Support C.O.S. view.

	Essential because risks in time-table tht. decn. shd. be taken now.



E.B.	Agree.



E.Sh.	Implications.  Decided (20) to avoid N.S. men with less than 6 mos. service.

	Means some battns will be short.  First detachment. (Leicester) no effect.

	Second : may be 50 short in M/sex. Rigid appln of rule may exclude HO/150 fr. each party.  May be able to operate rule more flexibility. Am watching effects of this.



E.E.B.	Can Colony give any financial help?  Cd. be considered departmentally.

	Long-term.  Re-inforcements adequate to deter attack : but not for major attack.  R.S.C. anxious not to be drawn into large commitmts

	

P.M.	That raises ques. of major intentns.   Does view tht. H.K. isn’t tenable v. major attack include attack by China.



C.A.S.	Our memo. contemplates defence v. Chinese major attack, but not R.



A.B.	What is value of H.K.



C.A.S.	Mainly economic.



A.B.	Can we defend H.K. v. irredentist local popn?  Cdn’t hold them down by mil. force.

	Don’t shout too soon.



H.D.	May we not be landed into indefensible posn.

	If H.K. has no mil. value it = economic + prestige.

	Econ. advantages can soon be cancelled out by cost of defence.

	Part I of memo. internal unrest.  What econ. advantages in these circs?



                    x/	Bottom of p. 4. New Chinese Army.  Formidable danger.

	Apprehension.

	Assumg. it shd. be held, is it U.K. interest only?  Have A. and N.Z. bn. asked if they wd. help?  Is India disinterested?  What of U.S.A. – wd. they help.  If none would, this wd. be burden too heavy for U.K.



C.A.S.	Comparison x/. is with past Chinese armies which = 0.

	H.K. closely allied Malaya and S.E.A. – politically and psychologically.

	Support C-in-C. recommn for firm action now.



E.B.	These ques. arose before we returned to H.K. at end/war.

	Opinions of War Cab. cdn’t afford to give it up.  Policy announced.

	Ques. v. U.S. and R. attitude : but went back.

	Can’t isolate this fr. our interests in Asia generally.  Discussed with Nehru.  Seeing Schuman today.

	Don’t want flamboyant speeches : but firm action and quiet will deter attack.  Think Comm. in China will want order there.

	Either scuttle – and be finished in Malaya – or be firm.

	Mustn’t let things drift.  Must watch it week by week and have rpts. to Cab.

	Mentioned to Acheson : they are interested because of Japan.

	Comm. countries.  No eagerness in Austr. Govt. to share our responsibilities.

	Tho’ on Burma, had Comm. mtg. got statement agreed tht. several Comm. countries will join in supplying money and arms.  N.Z. and A. didn’t want to play even on that : Ch. wdn’t even attend the mtg.



	Don’t however exclude Com. help in F.E in the end.  M’while must protect B. nationals and interests.

	F.O. will be respons. for watchg. this.  Cdn’t put fwd. policy now.



P.M.	Too early to be sure what Comm. may do.



E.B.	More concerned at desperate action by Kuomintang.



P.M.	But mistake to declare we are hanging on forever.

	Avoid committg. ourselves too far ahead until situation in China has become more stabilised.

	At same time mustn’t discourage B. people on spot.



N.B.	Consultn with Comm. Govts. – on Keepg. Consular etc. not recognising Govt. (all agreed) Amethyst (no comments).  Haven’t bn. consulted on re-inforcements, or longer-term defence.  Ought to, on latter.

	H.K. centre of B. trade over ? mainland – where our people have stayed.

	Might be point for stemming Comm. advance.  But can’t see this as analogy with Berlin.  Can’t be as confident of local support.

	Keep open possibility of w’drawg.



P.M.	Moral of this = periodical review of policy.

	Now : Send these re-inforcements w’out commitment for far future.



A.W.	Isn’t real threat Comm. Army supported by R.  That isn’t dealt with in C.O.S. memo.



	Form of announcement.



A.B.	First sentence commits the future.  Challenge of Colonialism.



A.V.A.	Strong view other way fr. Govr. Commer. Genl.  Designed to stiffen Br. and friendly Chinese.



A.B.	Ambiguous language &amp; definite action.



A.V.A.	Quoted Govr’s views on original draft.  Pressure fr. local people for firm decln of intention to remain.



P.M.	Can’t agree there is any implicn of scuttle in these words.

	First sentence as in copy marked x.

	Detail about re-inforcemts.



E.Sh.	Don’t favour this : for we mayn’t be able to send all these.



A.V.A.	How long cd. you w’hold informn.



P.M.	Can I w’hold it in debate?  Surely not.

E.B.	Avoid impln we are about to start another war.	[Exit A.B.



H.D.	Pressed for early consultn. with Doms.  Appreciation of situation : Govt. intentns.



N.B.	Agree.  Cdn’t do it in advance of this Cabinet.  Don’t expect large scale help.



E.B.	Public playing up of Comm. in this will ques. impln we are starting a war.

	Debate in H/L. today.  Recommend I say what we have done – Cohen is willing tht. his part be mentioned.  Right course : Govt. shd. decide now not to put them on trial – as wd. be done in Br. ct. martial.

Att.G.	Shd. charges v. them be published? 



T.W.  	No : drop it all.



G.A.I.	Why not punish them by publicity.



Att.G.	Detained them for years – shd. make it clear tht. charges were grave.



H.M.	Unfair to publish indictmt and refuse opportunity of defence by not putting on trial.

		   in air lift.





		7.	Police Pay.



C.E.	Outstandg. Rpt.  Better than Desboro’ Rpt., Complete analysis of value of pay etc.

	Problem of wastage.

	Recommns lower than expected.  Police Council likely to press for more.

	This however is balanced rpt. if we stand on it as a whole.

	No T.U. action open to Police.  Specl. responsibility on Govt therefore in not acceptg. it.

	Ty. agree subject to reservns on 2 points.



	a)  Pensions for widows.  Feeling out of propn. to sums involved.  Urge acceptance of Cttee’s rept.



	b)  Ch. C.’s : date of commencement for increases.

	Scale based on agreemt. with l.a.’s but repudiated by Co. Councils. Assocn. Police Cttee.  Subsequent negotns. carried it beyond date of issue of White Paper.  Ch. C.’s had therefore to accept p’ponement. They took it well.  They have given me loyal support.  R.S.C. told me then p’ponement wd. be only for a few months.  It has dragged on. Now strong recommn of Rpt. 

	Urge acceptce of rept. as it stands.  If we pick and choose we shall get into negotns on awkward points – eg. 3 yr. average for pensions.  Unless this is put in, may get w’spread resignns upon introdn of new scales.

	V. important to Police.

	Recruitment and retentn are based on havg. a contented force.



P.M.	Any objn – save on 2 reserved points.



E.E.B.	£26 m. Adds £4 m.  Serious, includg. repercussions.  But Cab. might feel they must attempt because importce. of Police.  Will Cab. accept this as exceptional and w’stand repercussions.



H.M.	Police pay is pretty good, taking a/c of allowances etc.

	V. big money.



G.T.	Ty. request that this be. exceptional.   Impossible.  Can’t prevent Buruhaen Cttees from takg. note of what Govt. have accepted for Police – even if I wanted to.  Will be repercussions and we shall find it impossible to resist pressure.  



A.V.A.	Will stimulate demand for independent Cttee. on Service Pay – as producg. better results.



	7. P.Q.’s in next weeks, provoked by this Rpt.



	a)	Widows’ Pensions.



E.E.B.	Repercussions.

	Widows’ pensions in C. Service – contriby. 50% - now in Parlt.

	Services : none for lower ranks.  Scheme now for introducg. these  and increasg. existg. for offrs. and n.c.o.’s.  Also contriby 50%.

	How can you justify non contriby. advantages to Police.

	In view of State insurance, shd. be chary of any new non contriby. advantages.



	Contribn wd. be 6d. a week only.  Not v. much.



C.E.	Oaksey said 2/= p. wk. if contributory.

	Actuary has now come down from 2/= to 1/1d.



E.E.B.	Police contn 5% includes contn to widows’ pension.



C.E.	£30 is fixed. No increase as for men’s pensions via pay.



J.G.	All supplem. schemes must be on contriby basis.  Is this element in Police pensions really contributory?



	5% will create bigger pool :  because of increased pay?



E.B.	Para. 116 – pensions worth 20%.  Man contributes only 5%.



P.M.	State paying 4/5ths.  Small Rpt. – increase if contns. increased.  Fedn. refused. Ty. case is much stronger today.



A.V.A.	Dislike non-contriby element esp. as Oaksey admits tht. any larger benefits wd. have to be directly contributory.



C.E.	Para. 9 of memo.

H.M. &amp; G.A.I.   Give the increase best exact contn of 6d. a wk.



E.B.	Support C.E. on dangerous of picking one recommn “out”.  Opens the way to arguing all the points.  Take it as a whole.  Despite repercussions.



A. &amp; T.W.	Support E.B.   



N.B. 	Also agreed.



H.D.	On merits strong case for 6d. contn.

	Illustrates danger of allowg. matters involvg. repercns to be handled by an outside Cttee.



H.M.	Don’t agree tht. this is sentimental point.  It is material – 6d. 

	Unhappy over repercussions.



E.E.B.	If accepted as a whole, wd. help if Cab. endorsed principle tht. any future schemes of improvemts. on schemes for widows : pensions shd. be contributory.

					Agreed.



	(b)	Chief Constables.



E.E.B.	C. Service Choskey increases – by instalments.  What answer to C. Service if Ch. C.’s given this at once.



C.E.	Attitude in interview with Ch.C’s.



H.M.	Is it reasonable to treat Ch.C.’s.



H.D.	Is it reasonable to treat Ch.C’s better than C. Servants.

							[Exit E.B.



	Agreed  : Accept Rpt. as a whole.



A.W.	Sc. l.a.’s. will be unwilling to pay these rates.

	Will handle them quietly.
