C.M. 12(49)							17th  February 1949



		1.	Parliament.			[Enter W.W., J.S., and Gl. Hall.



H.M.	Business for next week.





		2.	Private Members’ Bill.



		(a)  Adoption Bill : H.O. favourable.

(b)  Law Reform : discussed with promoters, to keep w’in reason.  2nd 

       Rdg. obtained.

		(c)  Maintenance Orders : will see how it goes.





		3.	Parliamentary Procedure : Imposing a Charge.



A.B.	Fletcher ruled out of order because amendmt wd. attract equalisation fund and impose a charge.  We amended S.O. to meet this on Private Bills.  Didn’t occur to me tht. Chair wd. use this to rule out so much discn on l. govt. matters.  Believe H/C. will resist that interpn.

	Suggest “usual channels” shd. consider.



A.W.	Thought this was clear.



A.B.	Even indirectly.

	Agreed : consider in L.P. Cttee or H.P.C.





		4.	Supplementary Estimates.



P.M.	Analysed supplementaries – as in note by E.E.B.

	Due to Ministerial decisions and unforeseen events – not lax Ty. control.



A.B.	(a)	Nat. Health Services.



	£10 m. attributable to Ty. intervention.  We had no prev. experience: Ty. asked us to knock £10 m. off : takg. it off a prediction was fictitious : R.S.C. promised to meet it as Supplementary,  tho’ he didn’t want it in original estimate.

	£22 m. for hospitals.  Didn’t know their state.  Neglect in war and interval awaiting “natn ” meant tht. condns had run down and £3 m. advanced capital expre needed.  Alterations in salaries of nurses and other staff – unforeseen.



	Increased provn of artificial limbs thro M/F.

	Grants to l.a.’s : improvemt. in ambulance services, consequential on improved fire services.

	£2.3 m. medical expenses.

	£4 m ? pharmaceutical services.  Increased price of drugs.

	Optical and dental is what worries me.  Diff. to control. Workg. off a backlog. many going to dentist who never did before – and dentists overpaid.  Spens. Cttee. v. expensive : in future more secular members on such Cttees.  G.P.’s not as bad – some are underpaid – but even specialists aren’t doing too well.



	We shall spread Harly St. more over provinces.  Dentists are the problem.  Spens said 33 chair hours per wk. to maximum.  Annual salary up to around £1.900.  Had to relate that to charges for particular jobs – and had to encourage fillings via. extractions. 

	Dentists then began to work 16 hrs. a day and to coin money.

	We then put in a limit of earnings.  They resent that.  We are now trying to negotiate a 20% redn. of charges.  Long term only ethical solution will be to put them on salary basis.  They are cheating the Revenue.  We can’t control them.



E.B.	Clinical costs of institutns under N.H. scheme eg. for busmen.  We found it much cheaper to provide service on co-operative basis.  Cf. L.G.O.C. instn. at Brixton.  Have M/H. studied that experience.



A.B.	Yes: taken evidence from all those sources.

	Monopoly Commn. will go into costs of dental materials – prob. one of the worst examples of rings.

	Optical services : Also a backlog.  But diff. to control professions wh. make money out of what they prescribe.  Shan’t get control under this lead until opticians are brought under oculists, so that latter decides who shd. wear spectacles.

	Two directions in wh. Service is costing more than it shd. is when private enterprise is in control – drugs and dentists.



A.W.	Spoke about costs in Scotland.			[Exit C.E.



H.M.	Hospital costs are v. large.  Good thing tht. H/C. shd. discuss.

	Always feared capacity of hospitals to spend money.

	Ques. how much we can afford on these Services.

	A big adminve mouthful. But some faults in adminn.

	Reg. Bds. £91-103 m.

	Teachg. Hospitals : from £10-18 m. = 80% increase 



(A.B. 	59% due to salary increases.)



A.W.	Also absolute increase in no. of nurses.



H.M.	Adminve costs have risen.  Some salaries may be excessive.

	Don’t endanger popularity of this Service by alarming taxpayer.



A.B.	Agree : but only running 9 mos.  Until it has bn. going for at least 12 months, we can’t do any comparative costing.



	These weren’t Estimates : they were guesses.  I cdn’t defend them.

	46.000 beds empty because of shortage of nurses.  Expre. on nurses ought therefore to increase.



	(b)	Food Supplementary Estimate.



J.S.	Dec. 11th ’47. Cab. decision to raise prices of bacon, tea, meat, eggs, cheese, butter.



	Estimates made on basis these increases wd. be made.  We starved.

	But Feb. ’48 White Paper on Personal Incomes.  R.S.C. asked us to p’pone.



	And at 2 monthly intervals ever since Ty. has ruled tht. we cdn’t do it. This has cost us £48 m.			[Exit A.W.



E.B.	What wd. cost have bn, if prices raised, in wages and costs.



Gl. H.	About 2 points in present c/living index.  Wage equivalent of this raises fr. industry to industry eg. in film industry only 6d. per point.



E.B.	Shd. be calculated for purposes of debate.



J.S.	Better to keep the debate wide.



P.M.	Attack will come rather on bulk purchase.



	(c)	Colonial Estimate.



C.J.	Mainly Palestine terminals etc.

	Otherwise	i)	transfer fr. Marketing Bd. for oil needs etc.

			ii)	H. Kong University.

			iii)	Food subsidies to Malta.



	None of these latter are diff. to defend in H/C. because earlier attitude on these ques.

						[Exit J.S., W.W., and Gl.Hall

						[Enter Att.Genl. and H.G.



		5.	Sea Bed Oil and Persian Gulf.



E.B.	As in memo.

	Approve (3) in principle and work it out.

	Agreed.
