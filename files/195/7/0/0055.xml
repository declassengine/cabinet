C.M. 61 (49)					21st October, 1949



1.	     Economic Situation.

			                                                     [All invitees + Chief Whip

P.M.	Form of Motion.



H.M.	Choice between “taking note” &amp; going further.  Must go further.

	“Takes note of P.M.’s statement of 24/10 &amp; declare its support of lines of action to Approve in substance.   deal with economic sitn there set out.”



A.	Opposn doesn’t want to have to vote against it.



H.M.	Prob. not.  They will prob. move amendmt but not vote v. Govt. motion.



			Approved in principle &amp; final wording to be settled by L.P., 	       R.S.C. &amp; Ch. Whip &amp; submd to P.M.





	National Health Scheme.



A.B.	Correction on P.H.  “Charge not exceeding one shilling”.



			Agreed.



	General



R.S.C.	This = interim p’mme.  Pending Budget, when posn can be seen more clearly, &amp; taxation etc., can be included.

	Investment.  Para. 6 not final figures – guidance to I.P. Cttee.

		Seen M/Ed.  Arranged tht. 71/2 m vice 15m. shall be included for educn.

	Govt. Expenditure.

		Sch I	+ M/H shd. exceed £28 m.

		Sch II Minor

		Sch III policy, but needn’t trouble Cab. in detail.  Nat Regn omitted pro-tem.  Still think we may be able to add it (£1 m.)

		Sch V Defer Legal Aid as far as poss.  Old scheme abandoned on introdn of new:  so we must bring in new qua co-terminous with old.  Means about £700.000.

			F/Britain £1m.



H.M.	I can see £600.000 certain.  Hope for £1 m.  Can’t absolutely guarantee.



R.S.C.		Sch IV N.H.S. 1/= for drug prescriptions.

			   Non-basic foods.

			   Agriculture.



T.W.	Not a special review.

	Also:  after “how far” insert “ if at all”.

		Defence.  Complicated.  Must depend on 3 yr p’mme. now in course of discn.  We can do no more now than deal with remainder of current year.  £121/2 m.  And as memo. is in terms of rate p.a. this is written in as £30 m. for this year.



H.D.	In investment, there is somethg. on Defence (in a £5m.)

	Cd. you present this as £35 m. cut on Defence.  



R.S.C.	No.

	Totals approved come only to £116.5 via £140.

	Want more.  For as time goes on, harder to make cuts.

	Want to go to maximum now.  There will be pressure to alleviate these measures as time goes on.  E.g. Ass. Bd. will be paying out more because c/living increase.

	One thing undecided in E.P.C. discns – milk price.  1/4d. wdn’t do because ½ pints  1/2d. wd. give £24 m. &amp; raise c/living by .34 of a point.



P.M.	Why pick on milk.



R.S.C.	People who need it most get it free &amp; won’t be affected by price alterations.

	At 21/2 pints a week it is only 11/4d a week.



A.B.	Wd. hit O.A.P.’s – already affected by prescription charge.



J.G.	Psychology about milk.



R.S.C.	Alternatives 4d on butter, 2d on cheese (£4 m), no subsidies on fish (£4 m).



J.S.	Wd. save £100.000 or £200.000 on staff if you de-controlled fish.  But prices wd. rise.  Wd. like to do it next spring.



E.B.	Against raising milk prices.  But butter, cheese &amp; fish together wd. give you much the same result.



R.S.C.	Trouble wd. be greater effect on c/living index.



A.B.	Politically impossible to touch any of these.



E.B.	These items ought to rise twds. economic price.  Butter will never come down to price we sell at, for years.



H.M.	Wd. rather get £20 m out of curative, rather than, preventive health service. (i.e. milk).



J.S.	To keep w’in food subsidy ceiling, there are bound to be other price increases over next 6 months.



H.W.	Greatest danger of inflation is round of wage increases.  And food prices most likely to start it off.



A.B.	Margin for error in the £28 m is enormous.  Aren’t we losing our sense of proportion?



P.M.	Not satisfied we can hold wages if we put more on food prices.

		Wd. prefer to seek the £20 m elsewhere.



E.B.	Agree.  Have bn. reviewing Germany.  By April I can greatly decrease costs – by complete change of organn with gter devolution to Germans.

		See savings between £8 and £10 m.



R.S.C.	Welcomed this.



H.D.	This is a better approach.

	The last £100 m of the gap is a guess. 



R.S.C.	Don’t dissent.



H.D.	There is a great measure of error.

	You have got to £256.5 + E.B.’s £10 m + anything M/H. can do on Sch I + a real push for adminve staff economies.  That’s pretty good.



P.M.	Agreed:  take a/c of £8 m for Germany but no announcement.



P.M.	Why can’t C.O. make a bigger contribn?



E.B.	W’ton decn re Germany saves us £18 m.  R.S.C. will consider wtr. this can be reckoned.



R.S.C.	This side of a/c is more directly related to Budget.  Want therefore as much as I can get.  More diff. to do it in April.

	Can we agree on fish?



J.S.	I wd. favour announcg. intentn to de-control fish in April.

		Then we shdn’t be increasg. price.  Efficiency of industry wd. be increased.

	Wd. close down a section of M/F.

		

		Half Agreed:  announce tht. we shall discontinue control of fish in New Year, at convenient date.



J.S.	Doubts crept in, however, about Transport equalisation arrangements.

	Suggd tht. this be considered – with view to possibility of eliminatg. all but contn to transport equalisn levy.

		Probable saving: £M4. less prs. 700.000.



E.B.	Let M/T work the subsidy to transport as agents.



R.S.C.	Agreed:  to settle for £4 m (fish) + Germany at £8 m.

		      i.e. an additional £12 m.

	Total figure for Govt. expenditure: £128.5 m

                                                  Capt. investment:     £140.0 m

			                           Total:    £268.5 m



	Prescription Charges:  O.A. Pensioners.



J.G.	Old scheme carried medical benefit to death for O.A.P.’s.

	Now he comes under N.H.S. &amp; has now to pay 1/= charge.

	He will be worse off than before.



R.S.C.	We shd. exclude them.  Exempt them as of right from paying the charge.

		Is old N.H.I. contributions – not merely o.a. pensioners.



G.T.	Prob. easier administratively to exempt o.a. pensioners as such.



A.B.	Say so at once.



			Agreed:  exclude o.a.p’s as such.



H.M.	“Revaluation”.  We can’t dodge “devaluation” any longer.



R.S.C.	Defence.  All this is w’out prejudice to considn of Future Size &amp; Shape.



C.K.	Sch. III. 4.  Public warning regud.  For people will have to make other arrangements.

			Extensn beyond 1 yr. will require legn.  



R.S.C.	Aware of that.



A.B.	General.  Not an inspiring picture.  No coherent theme.  Bits &amp; pieces.  No balance.  Opponents wdn’t be satisf. unless it were suicidal for us.

	Can assume therefore that Press will be hostile:  total cuts not enough, but each is wrong.

	Don’t like political outlook at all.

	£30 m. on Defence &amp; £30/40 m. on Social Services – won’t look good.

		Don’t believe in fair shares here:  priorities.

	To put this across, statement must be so made as to draw fire on private licensing bldg.  Put it as a class measure &amp; get it criticised as such.  Defence:   use excuse tht. long-term structure can’t be tailored in a hurry to meet short-term crisis.

	We still haven’t seen any plan to control expre in private sector.

A.W.	Can’t limit housg. announcemt. to private house bldg. – for can’t be true in Scotland.  I shall have to cut l.a. p’mme.

	In Scotland I have controlled private licensing.



A.B.	Scotland’s housing p’mme is still unbalanced - &amp; ought to be cut.



A.W.	I deny that.

	You can’t say l.a. housing won’t be cut.



P.M.	I can adjust this in form of statement.

		(e.g. gt. majority of this will fall on houses built for sale.)



H.M.	I believe Budgetary savings cd. have bn. greater.  Ministers shd. still look for more.

	But no good going into this debate in half-hearted fashion.



E.B.	Constructive side.  What can we say?  In a month we have constructed no policy.



A.V.A.	Policy of restrictg. inducemt. at moment when you must run harder in prodn to stay in same place.

	We shd. be offering inducements to workers, even at risk of inflation.

	You are beginning to release controls, but you offer nothg. to encourage workers.

	Crisis of 1931.  Economists prophesies never came true.  W’in 6 wks. deflationary policy was abandoned.  And action taken then re Defence had much to do with situation in ’38.

	Why are we in this state?  Because we never had guts to take proper action in 30’s.



G.A.I.	Workers will support us.

	Extra earnings can be accepted for extra prodn.  Not inflationary.

	We ought to tackle this as we did electricity cuts.  Done thro’ N.J.A.C. apptg. special Cttee to give advice.  They shd. be asked to tackle this industry by industry.

	What do we want?  Extra hours.  How?  Saty working:  employers don’t want it.  They want 3/4hr a day longer.  At what rate?

		Overtime:  makes no diffce to prodn costs.  Ask for another 2 or 3 hours a wk. &amp; leave it to them to decide how.



H.W.	Support that.

	Country waiting for a lead on hours.

	Diff. to decide in advance of E.P.C. discn this p.m. on raw materials.



E.B.	a) Don’t cut home supplies too much by diversion.

	b) Don’t lose assured markets in sterling area for sake of dangerous dollar markets where many of our industries have bn. bitten before.

	c) Measure of what we have got to do.  To remove restrns on imports of raw materials + %age of what we imposed before.  Looks like 2. bill. dollars.  How do we get it?  Want a plan.

	Note.   If a) is part of objection, all trades have to m’tain prodn.

		Not a ques. of selection.

	C.E.P.S. ought to make a guess at c).  My estimate is not more than 2-3 hours a wk. additional, at rate of current prodn.



		Don’t be dogmatic about method.  Assert principle &amp; let appln be considered by 53 negotiating bodies.  Let a Minister attend each.  Don’t think we’ll get results at big mtgs.

		Wd. rather got to York.  Don’t risk provokg. mass hostility.

	Say in statement:  These are the cuts:  but answer to it is prodn.  We call on workers.



P.M.	How can I urge this – if we are to cut imports of raw materials.



H.W.	Real ques.:  shall we take a risk on reserves in order to get raw materials.



J.G.	People now realise we are fighting for our lives.



G.S.	True when consequences of work can be seen + guarantee of raw materials.

		But in other industries it isn’t the same.



A.B.	I cdn’t ask for prodn in bldg. – with a £35 m. cut.  That’s what wrong.



R.S.C.	Assurances of dollar markets.  Stalled.

	Export drive:  campaign going for 2 yrs.  No ques. of a new policy.

	The new thing must be call for over-time in those trades.



G.S.	Yes:  but 90% of the contribn must come from management.

		For it is now selling.



P.M.	Contn by individuals.  Saving &amp; restraint on expenditure.  Am I to mention that?

	Increased prodn for dollar exports.  Uneven.  All firms shd. come up to standards of best.  Some trades shd. work longer hours.

	Shd. ????  come first: &amp; positive constructive side follow?



R.S.C.	I think it shd.



P.M.	How much detail?



R.S.C.	Only total figures &amp; illustrative details.

	Discussion re White Paper need.

	General feeling will be diff. to do w’out it.

	Technical diffies of doing it.



	Staffs.



H.M.	Party mtg. Complaints re nos &amp; salaries of staffs of public corpns.

		Hosp. Bds etc.

	Shd. S.I.M. Ministers + N.U.M. communicate with their Bds. etc., tell them what Govt. are doing &amp; urge them to do the same.



A.B.	It’s in hand in M/H.

	I wd. rather be particular than general.



R.S.C.	Let P.M. include a sentce  in his statement.  And Dpl. Ministers can hang their repns on that peg.



H.G.	Repn frequent:  but can’t get any facts in support.

	Politically, don’t apologise for public corpns.
