A.	Salisbury asking for debate.  Suggest Tuesday 25th July.



R.S.C.	Not before H/C. debate.





2.	    Parliament.



C.E.	a) 2 Can. ships.  Line shd. be “take them in their turn”.

	b) Cttee recommends decln of emergency if not settled by Monday.

G.A.I.	Support line on a) and b).



Att. G.	Not happy.  Seen Police.  Decln of emergency will, if made, be represented (in my view, rightly) as directed r. a lock-out.

		Put his view tht. this = lock-out.  Men had a right to with-hold their labour fr. ships affected by a dispute.  When employers then said if you won’t work these you shan’t work any, it was a lock-out.

	I cdn’t m’tain, v. Pritt’s motion in H/C. that this isn’t a lock-out in substance.

	Effect of Decln?  Dock Labour scheme cdn’t be suspended, but volunteers cd. be called to work the ships.  If such a call made, dockers wd. answer it.  They want to work ships other than Canadians.  Govt. wd. thus have broken the lock-out.



G.A.I.	Disagree that this = lock-out.

	Thing for us, anyway, is that men who stopped work, clearly struck.



Att. G.	If it’s a fact that men walked off the ships, it was a strike.

	But my informn is tht. employers didn’t call for men on ships other than Canadian ships – on 28/6.



G.A.I.	Ques:  have our dockers acted in breach of agreement.



A.B.	a) Is it enough for dockers to say, ipse dixit, tht. then is a dispute.

	b) Can an unofficial strike be a dispute?



Att. G.	There is no doubt that in law there is a dispute under both heads.



B.	Can have a wider discn on basis of my memo.



A.B.	Can’t depart from C.E.’s a).

	Study m’while advantages of Emergency Declaration.

	

			General support for that view.
