C.M. 13(49)							21st February 1949



		1.	Army and Air Force Court Martials.	[Enter A.H., E.Sh. and H.



A.V.A.	Early statement required.

	Some criticism of delay.  But Admy will apply about 6 of recommns of Lewis Cttee. administratively.



P.M.	Why didn’t you start Admy enquiry when Rpt. first submitted?



H.	We adopted some of recommns of Lewis Cttee.  Can’t be said tht. N. Disc Act is working unsatisfactorily.



P.M.	Even if results had bn. negative, enquiry cd. have bn. held.



H.	Cttee was apptd w’out consultn with Admiralty.  Admy had observer in touch with Napier Cttee. : might have bn. possible for R.N. to go ahead then.



P.M.	Is it poss. to go ahead with 2 Services w’out doing anything on 3rd?

	My view is tht. changes are so far reaching that we could not.



J.	I agree.  R.N. must have a chance of being heard before reforms applied to them.  And we cdn’t apply them to 2 Services not the 3rd.



H.M.	Right to delay as proposed.  But shall be criticised for not having thought of R.N. at earlier stages.

	Some of recommns are questionable.  Longer in wait, easier prs. to avoid carrying them out.



P.M.	M’while effect has bn. given to some of the recommns.



E.Sh.	It wd. help too if we cd. remove the delays.



N.B.	Comm. Govts. shd. be kept in touch with developmts.     Agreed.



P.M.	Draft Statement. Strengthen para. 3 – read out draft.



H.M.	Why rush Pilcher Cttee?



P.M.	Don’t tie it down to 3 months.  “Without undue delay” via “during summer”

						[Exit A.H., E.Sh., and H.

		Economic Affairs.		[Enter H.G., J.S., G.S and Barnes.



R.S.C.	Drew special attn. to para. 18.



H.D.	Worth publicising these figures?  Shows people are better fed.



J.S.	A little below pre-war calorie figure.

R.S.C.	Bad figure for us : working classes getting better fed.



J.S.	Figures show we are badly off for proteins, not calories.



R.S.C.	Plenty of vegetable proteins ()



R.S.C.	External Trade.



	Continuing diffy. of expanding trade in N. America.

	Percentage haven’t bn. rising, nor volume.  Value increase only.



H.W.	Paying our way on trade to U.S. Canada = problem.



P.M.	Coal export prospects?



H.G.	O.E.E.C. want 9 m. tons less than we said we cd. export in 1953.  May be able to expand exports to w. hemisphere by that amount.  Also doubt if we cd. produce the figure assumed.  W’in total, ques of grades.



H.W.	If we persuade O.E.E.C. to cut oil, they may use more coal.



	B/Payments.



R.S.C.	Drain rather below forecast.



	Prices.



R.S.C.	Signs of a real move in prices.  In U.S. eg. para. 29.  More likely to persist this year than last.



	Signs of easing in metal posn (tho’ hasn’t yet worked thro’ to price).

	In France big break in prices.  1300 fr. in 3 days drop in gold Louis d’or.



	De-hoarding of gold by peasants.  Eggs dropped 50% last week.

	Bacon and pork down too.  Effect of growing confidence in franc. 

	Will make it easier for us to buy.  Tendency, in long run, to improve terms/trade.



H.W.	Cairo cotton price is dropping.  Good for b/paymts. and also for competitive cotton exports fr. Lancs.



	Wood-pulp and newsprint too.

	May be general in non-dollar, non-sterling area.



E.B.	Can you control this movement?

	Much depends on wheat agreement.  Wd. be worth paying 5 c. more for wheat.



R.S.C.	No risk in U.S. where they have support prices.

	Risk is in France, where they have no means of controlling.

	We are watching this v. closely.  Wheat agreemt. is crucial.  And when we get that, we will examine other commodities and see where else a floor can be put in.



	E.R.P.



R.S.C.	Para. 36.  Satisfactory.  Reflects O.E.E.C. views.  And largely influences by U.K.



	O.E.E.C. Ministerial group constituted.  Looks as tho’ it may work.



	Miscellaneous.



A.W.	Enough scrap for steel?



G.S.	Industry expected internal scrap to begin to fall in spring ’48.  Hasn’t done so.  May begin to fall off now.



J.	Canada. Posn is disturbing.



R.S.C.	Only because not doing all we want to : doing much more than we did.



T.W.	Tractor exports?  



H.W. 	A few. France and Argentine need more.



C.J.	Wool. Are we short of target?



H.W.	Yes : but didn’t matter because market fell off. i.e. target was too high.

	Main diffy. is to sell all we can make.



E.B.	Tractors. Egypt cdn’t get what she wanted fr. us. Russia offered to supply.

	Danger of her offering to M/E. what we can’t supply.



	Agreed : B/T. and M/S. to look into this.
