		1.	Lynskey Report.		           [Enter W.W. and Att. Gen.

		

P.M.	Outlined his speech.

	Applns from personal friends.

	Diff. to generalise.  But considering wthr. further guidance shd. be given.



	Hospitality.

	Matter for good sense. But mistake to put oneself under obligns.



	Position of Parly. Secretaries.

	As in draft speech.



	Contact Men.

	Two types	(i) real experts : even here possibilities of abuse. 

			     Because access.

			Announce Cttee. under Edwin Herbert.



A.B. &amp; others.	 Suggested omission of reference to ex civil servants. Amended formula agreed.



			(ii)  agents who claim they can put people in touch with 		Ministers or M.P.’s and abuse the facilities of 			H/Commons.  Speaker thinks Wigg case is too stale for 		Cttee. of Privileges.  He is willing to review rules re 		adminn of strangers and their use of its facilities – with 		a Cttee. of 5 members (all Party). 



	This enquiry was welcomed by Cabinet.



Att.G.	Tribunal’s use of anonymous lrs.  Can’t be disregarded : basis of much Police action.  Not used in Tribunal procdgs. unless Police enquiries showed there was substance in them.



J.	Procedure is necessary on exceptional occasions.





		2.	Council of Europe.



P.M.	W.S.C. asking by private notice for further informn. re constitn. etc.



E.B.	Still under discn by Consultative Council – That must be the answer.

	Cab. informed that Speaker had refused it because answered by E.B.



								            [Exit A.

		3.	Parliament.



H.M.	Business for next week.

	Piratin’s Bill : Friday.



G.A.I.	Opposn. will help us in resisting this.



E.B.	T.U.’s will be in sympathy with its objects.



G.A.I.	It is too wide.





		4.	Newfoundland.



N.B.	As in memo.  A little opposn remains in Newfoundland.

	A.P.H.’s main point will be : shd. we not have arranged for a Parlt. in Newfoundland to ask for confederation.  We can answer that.  Opinion in N. moving steadily further twds. unanimous support of confederation.



P.M.	Basis of opposn = only 52% in favour.

	But only 48% favoured responsible Govt.



J.	Some substance in A.P.H. point – not legally : Parlt. is sovereign.

	But because we said we wd. return respons. Govt. on request and this course will make it imposs to do so in future whatever request they make.

	Shd. therefore have recalled N. Parlt. and got their consent.



N.B.	Recommn. of R. Commn. 1923. a) as J. says, but “when N. becomes self supporting” and she isn’t.  And people have requested somethg. different.



H.M.	Cabinet Commd to this policy for months past.  And Canada now involved.



R.S.C.	Why shd. we have forced their Parlt. on them v. majority declared in referendum.



A.B.	Our philosophy has always bn. tht. you shdn’t throw away democratic liberty by a referendum.  The majority was v. narrow – for an irrevocable decn.



R.S.C.	But Fedn. is not authentic to democracy or self govt.



	Memo approved.





		5.	Communism.



P.M.	Speakers notes prepd by F.O. We shd. take initiative in attack. Hope Ministers will make use of these.



		6.	Appointments to Agricultural Committees.



T.W.	Agric. Act ’47 requires me to appoint persons (to Ag. Cttees.) from a list of names submd. by the Natl. organns.



	But Unions are reducg. nos. on list to a point at wh. I have no choice.

	Also T.G.W. Union are appointg. Comm. to rural areas – organisers. They then submit tht. name for Agric. Cttee. I have twice refused. Deakin is upset.



	I propose to insist on enough names to enable me to exercise a choice.

	I also propose to continue to refrain from appointg. Communists.



E.B.	T.U.’s are in diffy. in gettg. officials (because by examn. and Comms. always pass) or M.P.’s.



	But socialised industries approach officials direct instead of thro’ Union Secretary.



	Unions haven’t got assistant officials coming along because people drawn out of other appointments.



H.M.	Think how to answer P.Q. – w’out admittg. political discrimination.



R.S.C.	But insist on having enough nominns to select.



Att.G.	Actually illegal. If Minister is requd. by statute to exercise a discretion he isn’t entitled to appoint if no opportunity to select from a list.



	Agreed : stand firm on necessity for choice.
