C.M. 68 (49)				                                                         24th November, 1949



1.	     Parliament.

				[Enter W.W.

H.M.	Business for the week.





2.	     Civil Aviation: Accident at Prestwick.



P.M.	V. peculiar.  No notice given to me.  Any precedent?



R.S.C.	Surely Ministers shd. come to Cab. Cttee &amp; make a statement.

		Quite wrong to write to Press, with no consultn with colleagues.



A.W.	Ld. Advocate not consulted.



P.M.	Am seeing Pakenham.





3.	     Exchange Control:  Payment to Informers.



P.M.	Causing trouble.  P.Q.



R.S.C.	Original legn in ‘60’ received on several subsequ. occasions.  Tho’ no exchange control then.  Part covered by Customs, who have authority:  part uncovered has now to be sanctioned by legn.

	£1.000 spent in last 12 yrs.  V. little.

	But v. important:  for 150 detected large-scale forger.



H.D.	Support R.S.C.  Agitn worked up as part of denigration.



J.	Agitn dishonest – done for yrs. under state sanction.  But extended recently beyond that.  E.g. M/F. spend £300 p.a. w’out legv sanction.

	When this began, it was common to rely on common informer.

		Ty. has be v. careful – 1.100 p.a.  But they don’t regard such ques. as wtr. informn involves breach of confidence – only value of informn not circs. under wh. obtd.  Principle – is v. unpleasant.



P.M.	All the same v. strong feeling.  Agent provocateur.



C.E.	Suppl. Ques. by Hinchbrook on Tues. – shows what we have to face.

	Police:  told informn not forthcoming because rates hadn’t increased since pre-war.  Authd increase.





4.	     Parliament Bill.



A.	Salisbury proposed to reject on 2nd Rdg.  W’out reasoned amendment.

		No long debate.  Division.

	Satisfactory.

	But is it “rejected”.  Or is 2nd Rdg. merely w’held.



P.M.	Will convene a small mtg. of Ministers to consider – v. technical.



					     [Exit W.W.

		         	                                             [Enter B., J.S., G.S. &amp; Edwards



5.	     Transport:  Financing of Commission.



B.	As in memo.  Coal, steel, timber &amp; wages built so large in operating costs tht. ratio must go up.  Passengers won’t pay more.  Goods must therefore carry it.

	Provn inserted in Transport Act. because realised it wd. be long time before Commn cd. overhaul charges system, enabling Minister to deal with transitional problem.

		Shd. use that probn now.

	Have spoken to Chairman of Tribunal.



P.M.	a) First sentence of draft in App. A.  Wd. be guyed in Press.  Must be altered.

	b) Road/Rail.  You are putting burden now on traffic wh. Can’t escape rail.  Will only make it worse.



N.B.	Demand is elastic:  &amp; raised rates will diminish traffic.  Has happened on raised passenger rates.

	Can’t expect long-term natn economics yet.  Must therefore get more revenue. But surely we must somehow equate road/rail.  ?By increasing road rates.



A.B.	If no interest payable, wd. there be a profit?



B.	Yes:  interest charges = £30 – 40 m.



A.B.	By natn we have guaranteed profits. – or rather guaranteed interest.



N.B.	At present traffic rates, rlways wdn’t earn enough to pay dividend equal to interest on Govt. compensn stock.

	A point of presentn.



B.	I have had to push traffic to roads, for policy reasons.

	Wanted to check output of new lorries.  But hasn’t bn. done.

		(Prodn Cttee).

	C. licences.  Have built up informn re tonnage &amp; purposes:  &amp; no evce tht. they have eaten into Commns traffic.

	Damage to rlwys. = drawg. passengers traffic away fr. railways.

	Transport Act policy is sound.  Where you can co-ordinate road &amp; rail the revenue gap will be fill-able.



P.M.	No indicn here of moving to that.

	And if you raise rail rates, &amp; do nothg. re road, you make posn worse.

	You must make road traffic more attractive than ever.



H.M.	Agree in principle.  Ques. of timing.

	Fixed charges on rail v. high overhead.

	Room for economics in opern.  N.U.R. lack of co-opn.

	Road freight charges cd. be raised:  but that wd. encourage C. licence encroachment in Commn’s work.

	Road passenger rates.  Mght. put revenue down.  Long-distance coaches cd. charge more:  and Commn can’t take them over.



E.B.	Is there a plan for co-ordinn.   Can’t expect mergers to be put thro’ in couple of years.  P.L.A. e.g. allowed themselves 5 yrs. + 21 yr p’mme of development.

	Shd. pay its way.

	But cdn’t Commn estimate losses for 3 years &amp; plan to get straight by then;  + work m’while on loan from Ty.



R.S.C.	Can’t pay a subsidy.  If presented as choice btwn. subsidy or consumer paying, I must say “consumer shd. pay”.



H.D.	Short-term borrowg. opern if repaymt. can be guaranteed from a co-ordinated transport plan.

	How fast is the surplus on roads coming along?



R.S.C.	Must be guarantee of repayment – or it will slip into a subsidy.

	Cd. you sustain a case for increasg. rlway capital by £100 m. for re-organn?  This wd. do, if you cd. see yr. way to makg. it a success financially at end of development period.



A.B.	Attractive.



H.M.	Worth looking at.

	But some wishful thinking.

	Hard to argue this = developmt.  Much is due to prices of coal, wages, steel etc.,  which we have authorised.



P.M.	May be.  But you still have to equalize betwn. road &amp; rail.



B.	Am I to water the capital?

	Diff. situation.  Have to cut staff, branch lines &amp; eliminate redundancies etc.  Hard to combine that with argument tht. need is for more capital development.



P.M.	I want temporary advance, not permanent addn to capital.



R.S.C.	V. unsound finance.  Reason is costs up 120% and charges only 50%.  No case for temporary loan.



N.B.	Repeated earlier arguments.

H.M.	Cd. you have immedte increase in road freight rates.



P.M.	Can’t settle long-term problem to-day.

	Ques.:        a) What shall M/T. say in debate

			b) What do we think of memo. appln.



H.D.	Drafts in Appendices give case away.



R.S.C.	No:  his decision comes after Tribunal’s advice.



B.	It does commit me.

	Commn have applied to me.  I must either take respons. for accruing losses or put case to Tribunal.

		I cd., however, say to H/C. tht. appln has bn recd but it’s repercussions on costs etc., need full considn.



A.B.	Cdn’t refce be only one part of considn.



P.M.	How far do you need to commit yourself. in referring?



B.	I must agree tht. there’s prima facie case.



R.S.C.	Everyone wd. accept that.



A.B.	a) Normal procedure w’out prejudging decision.

	b) Keep open for debate.

	c) Buy time.

		Thus, refer to Tribunal in general terms.



B.	That means opening everything to Tribunal, incldg. passenger fares.



R.S.C.	Commn haven’t asked for that.  You need only refer Commn’s appln  &amp; ask for advice. and views.  



B.	I could do that.



H.M.	Be aware tht. we will find it diff. to reject advice when given.



R.S.C.	Not if we devise a wider policy for meeting situation.



G.S.	Can’t confine hearing.  For trades will argue tht. sitn shd. be met by other increases e.g. passenger rates.



R.S.C.	Not passenger.  W’in freight rates they will argue alternatives but not passenger rates.



			Agreed:  {Appln to Tribunal in revised terms (H.M. &amp; R.S.C.)

			               {Genl. temporising statement in Debate.

			               {Proposals for long-term plan to come to Cabinet.



				[Exit G.S., J.S., &amp; B.

6.	     Retail Trade Wages.



G.A.I.	As in memo.

	Retail.  Indep. members think proposals are fair &amp; shd. be confirmed:  tho’ employers decline because cuts in margins.

	Confirmn is consistent with T.U.C. refce y’day to low paid workers.



						[Exit H.M.



R.S.C.	Agree to confirmn – if T.U.C. agree tht. it wdn’t embarrass them in light of their statement of y’day.



E.B.	Why wasn’t this done earlier.  Much easier if this had bn. cleared in Aug.



G.A.I.	The Wages Council didn’t finish consultn until Sept.



E.B.	Get this out of the way quick.  Otherwise continuing talk of low-paid workers.



A.B.	Timing.  N.U.M. meet in Dec. to consider low paid men.



Edw. 	Merits.  We made 5% cut in margins to fend off wage demands.

		Early Dec. H.W. will have to review.  If these wage rates confirmed we shan’t be able to m’tain 5% cut.  Otherwise, we just might.



G.A.I.	Ask how many firms have raised wages in consequence.



Edw.	No:  for we made arbitrary cuts w’out arguing figures. Now we can’t avoid considering figures.



E.B.	Sales of textiles only 1% of trade in these shops.



A.B.	Fatal if this confirmed and B/T. increase margins.



Edw.	I can’t refuse to take into a/c in price fixation.  Can’t therefore continue this on arbitrary basis.



E.B.	In presentg. decision, ante-date to August.



			Approved.	    [Exit Edwards

					



7.	     Germany:  Dismantling.



E.B.	Drew attentn to Telegrams (Wahn Nos. 223 – 224).

		Main point = shipbldg.

		Don’t see how I can object.

A.B.	Discloses absence of Europ. planning.

	World surplus of ship-repairing capacity.  Unemploymt in U.K. yards is appearing.  And at this moment we start German yards.

	cf. Fr. prodn of agric. machinery, while we have surplus here.



E.B.	We authd R.S.C.’s statement on “point of no return”.  We’ve said we are not going to integrate with Europe.  And we can’t have it both ways.  If we decline to allow France or Germany to dictate future of our steel industry, we can’t claim a right to dictate theirs.



R.S.C.	We can’t plan it for Europe for France &amp; Belgium can’t &amp; won’t impose economic control.  They believe in free economy.



C.E.	Uneasiness in ship-yards (S. Shields) because fear of unemployment.



E.B.	Repairs of passing tonnage.  Expand Sheerness.  Also spread repair &amp; new bldg.  Cab. Cttee shd. consider.
