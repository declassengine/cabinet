	2.	Iron &amp; Steel Bill.



H.M.	Talks with Opposn are proceedg.  If concln reached, this business cd. be

H.D.	What is basis?



H.M.	Commencemt. Oct. 1950:  Vesting date Jan. (or at worse) March 1951.



H.D.	O.K.





	1.	Parliament (resumed).



A.B.	Have Opposn had enough notice of War Damaged Sites Bill?



W.W.	They don’t object.



H.M.	Groundnuts.  Cab. or L.P. Cttee shd. consider rept. before H/C. 

		debated it.



	H/Lords.



J.	J. of P. Bill.  C.P. seeing M. Fyfe to find out if it can go thro’ on

		agreed basis.  If not, H/L. can take it more leisurely.



H.M.	H/L. debate on Econ. Sitn.  Advised Pakenham to stall until formal

		report by T.U.C. is available.



P.M.	Yes:  premature for the moment to offer comment.

	But M/L. shd. bring ques. up to Cab. as soon as possible.





	3.	Joint Consultation in Industry.



G.A.I.	54 industries contacted.  14 with model constn.  13/14 have agreed

		to recommend in principle.  Another group leave it.  Only 3 have

		no agreemt. or understandg. at all.

	Policy:  1st get 2nd group to adopt definite constitution as model.

	Socd indies are in forefront.

	Main trouble – reluctance of local Unions &amp; workers.  Must get the

		enthusiasm pressed lower down fr. T.U.C. level.

	Resoln on p. 1.  That body still expresses faith in this.

		N.J.A.C. have re-apptd their Joint Cttee on productivity.



H.W.	Much feeling in Parly Party.  Trade &amp; Ind. group.

	In individual factories management often obstructs real business

		being discussed in Joint Cttees.

	Textiles.  Progress slow because lack of enthusiasm of workers.

		Weavers now coming along.  Shd. B/T. drive them on.



G.A.I.	No:  not prodn Dpts.  Keep word “prodn” out of it.

		Prefer M/L. &amp; Reg. Bds. to do it.



H.M.	No soul in this.  Can be 1st class.

	Employees (some) afraid of it:  some unskilful in running it:  but

		workers repves aren’t always v. good either.

	T.U.C. needs to do more.

	Give picture of it wh. is real.  Good pamphlet.  Or even a film?



G.A.I.	There was a film.  And Human Factors Panel are considering it.



P.M.	Rlways aren’t so good.



H.M.	Figgins asked for 50% repn on Bd.  When declines, he held up all

		Executives’ offers of joint consultn.  Not till last week was he

		defeated.  N.U.R. will now play.



H.D.	Important to apply it to rlway. shops as well as not.



A.	More publicity for successful examples.



G.A.I.	Will circulate a memo. with examples of success.



H.W.	No fire because presentg. this a method of indust. relations instead of

		part of prodn drive.  Is M/L. right about this?



	Textiles – Weaving.

	More direct action to force employers to modernise plant.

	Govt. might make machinery &amp; hire it.  If we can’t direct them

		to spend money.

			Agreed:  Prodn Cttee to consider posn.





	4.	Prison Officers’ Pay.



C.E.	Prison popn up &amp; likely to continue high.  Aftermath of war.

	Prison labour – diff. to use modern methods in old bldgs.

		Taken over new bldgs:  but this must be “open” prisons.

	Old prisons – 3 to a cell.

	Hoped for 3.600 offrs. by end/50.  Under 3.000.  And nos. have

		fallen this year by 50.  Quality of recruits also is poor.

		Can’t expect to get good men in lowest grades.

	Details of claim.  Was askg. Ty. approval for offer in last column.

		Don’t think Assocn wd. have accepted – wd. have gone to arbitn.

	Since devaluation have had corrce with C/E.  Sitn in Prison Service

		isn’t due to inflation:  it’s due to full emplt. &amp; unpopular nature

		of the job.  But don’t want to start a new wage cycle.  And if Cab.

		think I shd. refuse, I want to do it as Govt decision on genl.

		economic grds. and not as Dpl. decn on merits.

	Cost to Exchequer.  2nd page of memo.

	Police.  1st 6 mos. of 49    232 total net increase. }

		    In Sept. ’49          265    ..     ..       ..        }  in U.K. as a whole.

		M.P.D. figures remain v. disturbing.  Believe it due to Force

		being so large it’s lost its human touch.  Shall have to overhaul

		whole system &amp; improve relns betwn. Supers &amp; insprs. &amp; P.C.’s.



P.M.	Annex P.1.  No value given for free quarters, uniform etc.



A.W.	Our problem is smaller.  But wastage last year was 85 out of 

		125 recruited.  Prison popn not so swollen.  Tendency in same

		dirn tho’ not at same urgent rate.  We cd. have waited.  But if 

		E &amp; W. go ahead we must follow.



Gl.H.	R.S.C. is still of same view as in para. 6.

	Unless we can bring these men under W. Paper as lower paid ……



A.B.	I have same problem over Health Service.  Axe falling on Dpts. in

		diff. phases.  Nurses ratio going tho’ Whitley machine – mental

		&amp; sanatoria ratio not yet fixed.

	Have therefore circulated memo.  Shd. they not be considered together.



H.D.	Genl. case v. this (Prisons) is v. strong.

	Thght. C.E. was content to let it go to arbitn &amp; argue on genl. grds. tht.

		this is not the time.  Govt. line.  As in last para. 9.



H.M.	Pn. Offrs. pay isn’t too bad.

	No evce tht. pay determines recruitment.

	Not convinced there is a good case on merits.



A.W.	My m.d. institution is staffed by mixed staff – part Prison Offrs. scales

		&amp; part Whitley Council.  There is therefore a connn as suggd by

		A.B.



G.A.I.	Wage increases initiated by Govt. wd. be bad.

	But def. decision not to allow this to go to arbitn wd. be bad too.



	Wd prefer therefore tht. Govt. shd. take it to arbitn (or encourage its

		going) &amp; put the genl. case there.



G.T.	Teachers’ appln involves millions.  And their minimum is £300.

		And Police are ahead of that already.

	I can’t hold this if we advance Prison Offrs. qua low-paid.

	Shd. be a Govt. decision to turn it down.  And oppose it at arbitn.



P.M.	Make no offer.  If they aren’t content they can go to arbitn.

		And at arbitn we can oppose it on genl. (Govt.) grounds.



J.	Serious decision.  Strengthen recruiting drive.
