C.M. 60 (49)					20th October, 1949



1.	     Parliament.

         [Enter W.W.

H.M.	Business for the week.

i)	Told Opposn we prefer economic debate in followg. week – for prepn. They consider however it shd. come on as soon as poss. after P.M.’s statement.

		They wd. then give us Profits Tax Resoln on the nod.



R.S.C.	Don’t want Profits debate before general debate.



			Agreed.



RS.C.	On genl. grds. also I incline to support Tory view in favour of early debate.



H.M.	ii) Will P.M.’s statement be long?  If so, spkr. may want it moved on Adjournment.  If early debate promised, Spkr wd. be more likely to allow it as statement.

iii)	Can’t have debate on adjournment because some proposals involve legn.

iv)	W.S.C. is pressing for 3 days:  Thurs, Fri &amp; Monday.

	Propose to resist this.  Two days is enough.  Wed. &amp; Thursday.



		Agreed.



v)	P.M.’s broadcast.  Now believe it shd. be on Monday night.  Statement must be short &amp; factual.  B’cast can add background &amp; explann.



			After 9 pm. news.   



			Agreed.



R.S.C.	Speakers in debate.  P.M., R.S.C. &amp; prs. E.B.

	Decide finally when policy settled who the third shd. be.





2.	     Housing.  Local Authority Waiting Lists.



A.B.	Piratin’s P.Q.  Promised publn, in reply earlier P.Q. by Piratin.

	Results aren’t politically inspiring – 1 m w’out sep. homes &amp; 600.000 needg. improved accommodn.

	And juxta-position with economic debate is v. unfortunate.



P.M.	In Ldn. v. few people had a house to themselves pre-war.

	Does this mean separate entrance house?



A.B.	Yes.

P.M.	Ridiculous to imply tht. this shd. have bn. chased up in 5 years.



A.B.	I will put best poss. interpn on figures.  But I’m sure I daren’t withhold them.



H.M.	Certainly delay publication.

	Cd. you say tht. they are so confused tht. publicn wd. be misleading.



A.B.	Might say proper pictures obtainble only by house to house survey &amp; cdn’t justify use of staff requd for this purpose.

	Will stall to-day &amp; submit a formula to Cab. in a week or so.





3.	     Election to Security Council.



E.B.	Diff. situatn re voting over Czechoslovakia.

	Told when in N. Yk. inclinn to vote for Yugoslavia, because dispute with Russia.

	Generally spkg. an understanding tht. R. was given 2 on Sec. Council &amp; U.K. given 2 counting Commonwealth countries.  We have since then voted in acc. with that understanding.

	Didn’t want to get into row with R. over this – small issue.

	U.S. disregarded earlier understanding &amp; let it be known they favoured Yugosl.

	I told Comm repns I didn’t favour getting into row with R. over this.

		Not sure of Tito’s intentns:   he might take initiative if encouraged, in aggression  e.g. v. Bulgaria.

	Vyshinski had now spoken.  Big pressure from R.C.’s (S. American States) in favour of Yugoslavia.

	Still think we shd. not change earlier stand – let it go on geographical basis &amp; original understandg. &amp; support Czechoslovakia.

	If it becomes clear tht. Czech. won’t get 2/3rd’s vote, I may have to change over &amp; vote other way.



A.B.	Not so sure.

	Disquieting tht. U.S. wdn’t see Yugoslavia thro’, in last resort.

		A v. serious situation.

	We can’t say less re Yugoslavia than re Hong Kong.

	My view wd. be tht., if Yugoslavia can’t get support of W. Powers in this it will appear tht. she has bn. thrown to wolves.

	Tactics for handling R. = repeated diplom. black-eyes.



A.V.A.	But we originally declared support for Czech.  V. significant move to change over now because R. Yugosl. quarrel.



A.B.	Emergence of nationalist crumblings on periphery of R-dominated Europe is only encouragement we have.  Encouragement of Titoism is much more important than observance of conventions re voting for seats in international bodies.



E.B.	Favour support of Tito.  But don’t want it mixed up with this issue.



			Agreed:  support E.B.  Record A.B.’s misgivings.





4.	     Christmas Food Bonuses.

[Enter J.S.

	 

J.S.	Bacon:  can give bonus for 4 wks. vice 2.  because increased perishable supplies.

	Poultry:  chances are weaker because Hungarian diffies.



R.S.C.	Awkward.  Sugar bonus = 800.000 dollars.

	Total cost to Budget over £1/2 m. – only 50% of it w’in subsidy level.

	Bacon – can’t be helped.  But can we go on, getting it in fr. non-dollar sources, affectg. total balance.

	If any diffy. with Argentine, w’hold the meat.

	Sweets &amp; sugar I am most concerned about because dollar &amp; subsidy cost.



J.S.	No direct sugar bonus – only sugar in sweets.



A.B.	Normal psychol. doesn’t find diff. in this.



J.	Announcement needn’t be too close to economic debate.



			Agreed: 2. suspend announcement for 2 weeks.

1.	Approve in principle.

2.	Submit to Cab. again before final decision.
