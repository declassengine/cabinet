C.M. 39(49).				30th May, 1949.



	1.	Strikes:   Docks and Railways.            [Enter  H.McN. and 

			                                                      M.R.W.

	Docks.



G.A.I.	Not worsened.  No hindrance to military.  Unloaded tomatoes fr.

		Montreal City as well as bananas fr. Bayans.

	Mtg. in Bristol – looks as tho’ organisers are losing grip.

	Hasn’t spread.  1.200 at Lpl. holdg. off ships diverted fr. A’mouth.





	Railways.   N.U.R. more than loco-drivers &amp; firemen.  R. Executive

		mtg. Unions to-day.

	Wages issue – formula found to get both sides into conference.  Now

		meeting.  One a side only, unfortunately, and can’t trust Figgins.



P.M.	Have issues bn. put over to men?



G.A.I.	Slow in doing it:  but done it now.



H.M.	Someone must organise better publicity over strikes.  Shdn’t M/L. 

		take responsibility?  Or Dpt. concerned with subject matter.



G.A.I.	Shd. be means by wh. some party not involved in dispute gets facts 

		stated.  R.E.C. prob. didn’t want to exacerbate dispute.

		M/L. don’t want to upset either side if they are in end to be 

		conciliator.



P.M.	Why can’t M/L. put C.O.I. on to it?



A.B.	Discussed at Em. Cttee.  M/L. can’t act until officially au fait.  At

		A’mouth T. &amp; G.W. Union had circulated leaflets &amp; held mtgs.

		But facts are v. complicated.



P.M.	Do we trust the Unions?  Or do somethg. Governmentally?



C.E.	Docks Dpt. of T. &amp; G.W. Union has no control over its members.

		Its efforts carry no weight at all.

	Diffy. of Govt. issuing any statement wh. mayn’t be regarded as 

		partisan.



G.A.I.	Embarrassmt. of M/L. taking the initiative in publishing – tho’ they

		can collect the informn.



P.M.	I will speak to M/T. about rlway strike – R.E.C. cd. have handled this

		better.







	2.	Cyrenaica.



H.McN.	C.F.M. &amp; U.N. Assembly have both failed to solve problem of

		Italian Colonies.

	Amir says he must make statemt. at his tribal Assembly mtg. at

		Burghazi to-day.  He proposed “independence”:  told him we

		cdn’t go so far as that.  We recommend statement as in Tel. 182.

		Paras. b) and c) are most important points.

	Regret haste.  H.M.G. must make their statement by Wed.

	E.B. discussed with U.S. and Fr.  Latter told Italians.  Sforza is upset.

		Propose, if Cab. agree, to explain tht. we cdn’t tell them before 

		because no Cab. decn:  but on other territies will discuss closely

		with them – w’out promising not to decide without their consent.



R.S.C.	Agree with Sforza.



H.McN.	E.B. had to consult U.S. and Fr.  Always understood we wdn’t consult

		Italy.

		Bevin/Sforza agreemt. related only to Tripolitania.



J.	Will have repercussions on other parts of Libya, where we have 

		promised consultns with Italy.



H.McN.	Amir has bn. holding his people for 6 yrs.  He’s on the spot.  If we

		don’t make a decln, he will be forced to say somethg. worse.



R.S.C.	Sforza is generally upset, but also concerned about working.

		cdn’t we see him &amp; try to modify it to suit him – thro’ Amb. in

		Rome.  E.g. Para (d), which might link this too much with rest of

		Libya.



H.McN.	i)	Territories are inter-related – whatever words you use.

	ii)	Fr. &amp; Ital. always concerned about Cyr. because effect on their

			interests.

	iii)	We do mean to achieve independence:  they don’t want it.



P.M.	Remember Arab dislike of Italians.  Diff. for us to go v. far with 

		Sforza.  Mght. consult him on the wording.



R.S.C.	Opening &amp; closing words link it up v. closely with B/Sf. agreement.



H.D.	Approve substance.  But wise to show some courtesy to Sforza.



A.B.	Cdn’t preamble and d) be dropped?



R.S.C.	Let it arise out of Nat. Council mtg. rather than U.N. discussion.



H.McN.	Preamble included because our diffies with U.N.  Some will say we

		have no status to alter territory sitn.



R.S.C.	Covered by concldg. words of a).



H.McN.	All right.  But omission of d) wd. arouse Arab suspicion.



R.S.C.	Open with statemt. tht. while it wd. be inappropte for us because 

	x/	U.N. discns to refer to Libya generally, so far as Cyrenaica 

		is concerned ……



			Agreed:  Consult Sforza on wording and try to get him

			               sweet, as a matter of courtesy.

			               be ready to modify on lines of x/.



A. &amp; others.	Doubtful about omitting (d).



A.V.A.	Pakistan will attach importce of (d).



P.M.	Prefer x/.



H.McN.	Cyrenaica is v. much concerned about unity of Libya.



R.S.C.	But Nat. Council of C. is not forum for big internatl decln on that.



H.McN.	Ready to omit refce in preamble to U.N. mtg.

                    |	Put (c) higher.

                  y|	Consider any modifn of (d) wh. is acceptable to Amir.  E.g. “prejudice

                    |		the future of Libya as a whole.”

			Agreed:  as at y/.

			                                            [Exit  M.R.W.

			                                            [Enter  H.G., J.S., Bott. &amp; G.S.

	3.	Import Policy.



R.S.C.	Seek authy to submit to Consult. Group of O.E.E.C. this general

		scheme.

		It involves replacing Art. 9. by provns of Havana Charter.  Put

		this to Harriman – fair chance of U.S. agreemt.  But if we don’t

		get it, we can’t go on with scheme at all because Comm. 

		countries.  If U.S. waive Art. 9., Canada will also.  May then

		have to allow token dollar imports – at prob. cost of £2 m., a

		cheap deal.



H.M.	Discussed at E.P.C.  Decided it shd. come to Cab.  For public must be

		made to understand its main objects.  Econ. educn of our people

		good on internal ques., not so good on external.

	Relaxn of import licensing will mean increased competn with U.K.

		industry.

	Horticulture &amp; engineering.  May cause local unemploymt.  Awkward

		if it comes before public realise genl. long-term advantages.

	Para. 8.  U.K. taking the lead.



R.S.C.	For our protn:  for if we do it unilaterally we are free to stop it.  If we

	bound ourselves to do it if they did, we shd. have no liberty of action.

	Cdn’t become effective until autumn.



H.D.	And details wd. be subject to review.

	This isn’t the time to create unemployment.



R.S.C.	Can’t continue this uncovenanted protn for U.K. industry 

		indefinitely.



A.	Worth many risks to get rid of Art. 9.



P.M.	Public announcement?



R.S.C.	Wd be form of new Inter Europ. Paymts. Scheme.  About end/June.



G.S.	Announcemt. will need careful handling.  Or adverse re-action 

		e.g. fr. workers in engineering industry.  Support this, but ask 

		that full expln be given.



R.S.C.	Ministers shd. see industries concerned &amp; explain posn to them, when

		we know this is going thro’ O.E.E.C.



A.B.	Cd we examine means of speedily imposing tariff?



R.S.C.	B/T. are doing so.



H.M.	Econ. Infn Unit might be looking at problem in advance.

			                                          [Exit  Bottomley.

			                                          [Enter  Barnes, Edwards, Att.G.

	4.	Economic Affairs.



R.S.C.	Exports can’t sell &amp; supplies coming on home market.  cf. cars, wh. 

		can’t sell at all in U.S.

	Developmt. areas have got stuck because new (weak) industries are

		feeling slack in sellers’ market.



E.	Hoping to produce rept. in July on developmt. areas.  D.I. Cttee are

		mtg. this week.



R.S.C.	Approachg. point where we shall have to start national factories in

		S. Wales for example.



A.B.	V. wasteful policy on pneumoconiosis in S. Wales.  V. many men cd.

		work at things other than mining &amp; are being m’tained in 

		idleness.  M/S. have power to do direct work.  Shdn’t they at

		once consider what they can do?  If they haven’t powers, we

		should take them.



R.S.C.	Not so easy e.g. to decide what we shall manufacture.



G.S.	R.O.F.’s themselves aren’t v. busy.



A.B.	Cdn’t Prodn Cttee consider:  on report from ? M/S. – incldg. ques. of

		powers.                    Agreed.



	Production.

R.S.C.	5% increase of productivity (?) – v. remarkable.



H.D.	No comparison with pre-war.



R.S.C.	Figures aren’t available.  But roughly 1946 = pre-war.



A.V.A.	Is prodn  dropping (March)?  cf. Chart.



R.S.C.	Can’t tell from one month’s figures.



H.G.	Absenteeism in mines.  Am submitting memo. to Cab. on relation to

		Ind. Injuries Act.



A.B.	Bldg. Applicants:   distn betwn. those sharing homes &amp; those wantg.

		better house

	In 1st category, all agric. workers will have bn. satisfied by end/year.  

		Can’t give 1st priority to agric. workers in 2nd category.



P.M.	Can’t give snap decision on that w’out a memo.



R.S.C.	New table on Stocks Values.  Posn about same as end/48.

		But much more private stocking.  So we are better off.

	Prices.  Considerable fall.

		Non-ferrous metals.  To make our indies competitive, shd. we 

		take a loss or shd. we m’tain differential.



G.S.	V. big ques. – wd. like to discuss with R.S.C.  Many indies don’t want

		us to come down quickly to U.S. levels.  Are bringing them down 

		slowly, at some loss to Exchequer.  Differential is not

		handicappg. any indies wh. are important to our export trade.

	Built up £6 m. profit.  If we reduced all at once, wd. cost that &amp; a

		further £12-13 m.

	Cars.  Increased supply to home market is due to increased prodn.

		Exports quota (70%) m’tained.



	Argentine.

R.S.C.	Nat. Ec. Council.  Purpose not clear.  We have gone to limit.  The 

		Ares/Bramuglia Agreemt. was a good one.



J.S.	Even if it is turned down to-day, they wd. resume discn in a month.



	Israel.

R.S.C.	Agreemt. concluded in accce with Cab. decision.

			

	[Exit  H.McN., B.



	5.	Re-sale Price Maintenance.



Edw.	Expld re-wording adopted after consultn with Chairman of Monopolies

		Commn.

                        a)  Statement before B’pool.  For this is somethg. we cd. do in reln to 

		distribn.

                        b)  Don’t upset Monopolies Commn.

                        c)  Want to do somethg. in distribn.  Legn wd. take a v. long time &amp;  even threat of it wd. preclude helpful consultn with interests.



H.D.	Rpt is good so far as it goes.

	Support statement – want it made before Recess.

	On memo.  I believe recommn re collective arrangemt. can’t be put

		into effect w’out legn.  No hurry:  but don’t use words 

		excluding legn in next Parlt.

	Support Smith’s dissenting memo.  He wd. have put it higher if he

		had own way.  Don’t therefore use words whitewashg. 

		individual price maintenance.



A.	P. 3(b).  Why is Proprietary Articles Trade Assocn to be referred “at

		some point” to Monopolies Commn.  Why not in first batch?

		The thing to go for.



R.S.C.	Other things have a much more direct bearing on c/living.



A.B.	Also want a few dramatic cases to start with.



J.S.	Effect on food trades.  Want to go further.  A few words in statemt.

		seem to commit us to favourable view on individual arrangemts.

		Legn wd. help &amp; wd. strengthen Co-ops.  Leave open 

		possibility to legislate on whole field.



R.S.C.	Want the ques. left open – for full discussion.



H.G.	Refce to M/F. only  Substitute:  “other Ministers concerned”.   Agreed.



A.B.	Re-consider draft – to sharpen it up.     Agreed.



			Agreed:  Edwards to revise in consultn with R.S.C.

			                                    [Exit  H.G., G.S., Edwards, J.S.



	6.	Ireland Bill.



J.	5.13 of B.N. Act.  Depends on s. 2(4) of Eire Act, which goes back to

		Art. 3 of Constn of 1922.  “Every person domiciled in the area of

		the jurisdn of the I.F.S. who was born in Ireland ….”  We have 

		taken jurisdn to mean 26 counties tho’ “Ireland” means whole 

		island.  But Irish now say Ulster month from 6/12:  Ulster went

		out 7/12:  Eire powers extended to N.I. for that month:  and on

		6/12 Dublin jurisdiction extended over whole island.

	This emerged thro’ Simon.

	Have since ascertained that this is official Dublin view.

	No alternative but to put down amendment.

	But it will cause a row with Dublin.  Will involve re-opening the

	x/	1947 Agreemt. on Naty Bill.



R.S.C.	Cd you put it other way round – declaring they are B. subjects vice

		declaring they aren’t Eire citizens.



J.	Will ask draftsman.



N.B.	Dulanty’s claim is as at x/.  Will be another charge of breach of faith.

			Memo:  approved.



N.B.	Can’t give Dublin any notice now.



P.M.	Tell Dulanty before lunch.
