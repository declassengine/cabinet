C.M. 2(49)							12th January 1949 (3 pm.)



		1.	European Unity.



H.D.	Exclude small nos. from draft? Adhere to 8?



R.S.C.	8 is too small because means only about 2 for eg. Greece.



E.B.	Start low and leave room for concessions.

	Give latitude between 8 and 12. Start with 8.



R.S.C.	Not enough.  



H.D.	 Then say 12 and give us no latitude to go higher.



N.B.	Think of a) total size  b) enough work for each delegate.

	12 wd. give total of 100. Not v. satisfactory.



	Agreed : 12 and no extension.



R.S.C.	Functions. Some latitude to Council to initiate discussion.



E.B.	Don’t want us to be whipping-boy on this Council. They won’t attack U.S.  Criticism will concentrate on us. As always : but h’to, having a Navy, we didn’t care. And now we have also to consider Commonwealth.

	Earlier plan was power of ⅔ majority to initiate discn. Not finally opposed : but prefer to keep it up our sleeve pro tem. ⅔ of Govts : for each Delegation has only one vote.



	Agreed : offer this provision at once. In place of 2nd sentence of “Functions” Para. 3(b).



E.B.	Frequency. Once a year, with duration of not more than 3 weeks.

	One ordinary with scope for one or more extraordinary.

	Procedure : Card vote as in Alternative B.

	Commissions etc. Agreed.



E.B.	Location.  Favour Strasbourg. We must bring Germany in.  Get a novel idea.   Agreed.





		2.	Indonesia.



E.B.	Early history, as before.

	I tried to get Dutch to put thro’ the various (successive) agreemts.

	Security Council now mtg. N. Yk. Our man hasn’t spoken.

	This is Netherlands sovereignty. If they raise that ques. we can’t deny it.

	Impose now to call for w’drawal of Armies now they are in capital and all over the country.

	My solution is tht. Dutch shd. announce at once tht. they are going to

                    x/ have U.S. and Indonesia and a genuine transfer of power.

	Suggest we shd. in Sec. Council adhere to 3 points – as in memo.

	Evce is tht. local inhabitants are relieved at arrival of Dutch.

	Suggest we press tht. Dutch shd. proceed as at x/.



P.M.		No formed Forces fighting there.			[Enter T.W.



E.B.		Even guerillas are unlikely.



N.B.	Support E.B.’s line. Tho’ Australia will prob. wish us to press for immed. w’drawal of troops.





		3.	China.



E.B.	Invited to intervene by Chang K. S.) between his Govt. and Comms.

	Fr. U.S. and U.S.S.R. also invited.

	Asked U.S. wthr. we shd. consult Fr. and U.S.S.R. They say Hell! No.

	Won’t consult R. Intend to say “no good purpose in intervening”.

	C.J. feels that because  of H. Kong and Malay we shd. not intervene. Wd. have repns. there.  N.B. takes same view because of  Asiatic Doms.

	Will reply that we don’t intend to intervene.



P.M.	Shang is past saving.



A.V.A.	R. will intervene. To seek Nationalist support.
