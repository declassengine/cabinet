C.M. 12 (50)					17th March, 1950



1.	    The Economic Situation.



[Discussion of C.P. (50) 35 was opened at end of E.P.C. Meeting, 

10.45 am 	among of that Committee.]



A.	… we are takg. money fr. people to prevent them spending it.

	Suggest this has gone too far.

	Taxation also does same – for producer embodies tax in prices.



R.S.C.	No, he doesn’t.

	We are doing 2 things

a)	tax for Govt. expre

b)	W’drawg. money to prevent spending.

	We are over-doing b).  Evce i) Dis-saving  People w’drawg. savings because can’t meet expre out of income.  ii) increased sale of 2nd hand goods.  This means people aren’t left with enough to meet normal needs.

	Prodn expected to increase by £200 m.  = extra goods available. If we go on takg. money fr. people so they can’t buy, increased prodn will be inflationary.

	Destroying incentives.  What tax is paid on overtime?  Inhibits extra work.

	People ought to have more money to spend on goods, wh. they need.

	Shan’t analyse below/line expendre.  Some = l.a. expre.  Agree isn’t relevant to argument how you use surplus.

	Heavy taxn also serves to keep up prices.

	Concln:  abate surplus to enable people have more to spend.



P.M.	I too have had my doubts.

	???? of purch-power by taxn is nullified by dis-saving, living on capital.  Our policy of compuls. saving thro’ taxn also kills saving by individuals.

	Does this affect insurance?  Surely people can’t keep up premiums because insufft income.

	Too much cap-investment out of taxation vice loan finance over a no. of years.  Also debt repaymt.



R.S.C.	Whatever we spend on investmt. must be paid in current year.

		Over last 3 yrs. income has sufficed to meet minimum investmt. p’mmes.

	Increase in consumptn expre can’t be done without compensatg. cut in cap. investmt.  When can we cut?  Past experience shows diffies.  Also must be effective, not nominal, cut.

		Disastrous policy.

	Addl £200 m prodn.   i) increase purchasg. power with increased prodn.  Av. earnings have risen 2/6 p. wk. because piece work.



E.B.	Not a v. large increase.

R.S.C.	11/2 m. p. week. anyway = £78 m. more of purchasing power.



P.M.	Is taxn a disincentive.  



R.S.C.	Until change in lower income tax 2 yrs. ago it was widely alleged tht. P.A.Y.E. discouraged overtime.

		No longer the case.



E.B.	Increase in earnings is small.  Law of diminishg. returns?

	What propn increase?



R.S.C.	21/2%

	£200 m.	A portion met by increased earnings &amp; profits

			A portion must go into increased exports.

			A portion meets lower E.R.P. &amp; devaluation.

	I believe this will eat up at least all increased prodn.



A.B.	Two diffies

a)	Operatg. in world when prices movg. r. us. Larger exports to earn same imports.  Unlike U.S. N.Z., Aust.

	Large substractn fr. out wealth.

b)	devaluation – by wh. U.S. levy tribute on whole world.  They have raised their standards at out expense.  (R.S.C. Balanced by E.R.P.)

	My main point, however – with full employ. R.S.C.’s figures are unassailable.  But behaviour of income groups.  At lower levels shoe pinches – as shown by dis-saving etc.

		Those mainly responsible for increased prodn (technicians &amp; managers).  Upper levels are prosperous (£3-4.000 p.a. with heavy expense accounts).  Full emplt. increases cap. value of possns:  but they don’t like havg. to live on capital.  Tends to produce inefficiency - &amp; attacks qua disincentive.



P.M.	£800 p.a. + heavy taxn is resented more than £500 + little taxation.  Alienation of income.



A.B.	Can’t relieve burdens on higher levels.



R.S.C.	£500 -£2.000 group have had more relief than any.



A.B.	But for us serious point:  decline in working class savings.



R.S.C.	Current savings keep up.  It is realisation of past savings, built up during war.



A.B.	This is why we hear so much of pre-war credits. Not much therefore betwn. R.S.C. &amp; A.  Matter of degree.  How much can we spare fr. cap. investmt. – is that p’mme tolerable.

	But nothg. to be said v. theory of new Budget.  That is beyond criticism.

	All we can discuss = re-distribn of existg. resources.



P.M.	Are we puttg. too much into new capital equipmt. when we aren’t using full our existg. equipmt.  cf. Rlways.



A.B.	E.B.’s point about over-time dropping off because better organisn of workg. week.

	Increased cap. investmt. may not be bringing proper return in increased prodn.





11.15 a.m.	[This being the hour for which Cabinet had been summoned, the remaining members of the Cabinet entered at this point &amp; the discussion was re-opened.]



P.M.	E.P.C. have had preliminary discn.



R.S.C.	Ques. at issue.  Policy for Budget.  To elucidate policy of last 3 yrs. have submd memo. indicatg. my approach.

	Issue raised by others.  Can we reduce surplus above line &amp; give tax relief, presumably in lower/l. middle groups.

	Arguemnt. in favour:  we are forcibly saving by surplus more than consumers can bear, as evidenced by dis-saving etc.  If this were reduced by say £100 m. we shd. secure more incentive &amp; comfort.

	My view:  Over 3 yrs. we have followed novel Budget policy – using surplus to m’tain emplt., disinflation &amp; capital investment.

		So long as full emplt. we must verge on inflation.  This danger will be greater comg. year because devaln, diminishes E.R.P.  If therefore we are to avoid it, must keep surplus up.

	Reason for surplus – contns to savings for cap. investmt.  Said tht. tax relief wd. mean more private saving.  True only of higher income groups.  In lower, any excess wd. go into consumption. We shd. therefore be switchg. fr. investmt to consumptn.  That can only be on basis of effective cut investmt this year:  &amp; we know diffies of quick cuts in that p’mme.



E.B.	V. diff. posn.  With good majority I wd. have favoured vigorous approach on difft. conceptn fr. 1947.  I shd. have accepted full emplt. as foundn.:  &amp; realise it’s inflationary dangers – a nice balance.  Until 3/4  years’ experience more, can’t say how this will work as perman. policy.

	But with small majority can’t risk basis of ’47 conceptn.

		W’in it, adaptn shd. be possible.  Agree Budget &amp; instrument of econ. planning.  As E.R.P. is comg. to end in ’52, gt. prepns for that are necessary – mustn’t therefore abandon ’47 conceptn.

	But in detail – operative effect.  Wage freeze is operatg. v. hardly on 4/5 m. of workers, with largest families because labourers.

		Embarrasses T.U. leaders.  Can this be met by Budget relief or otherwise?  In this Budget we have to decide –

a)	What shall we do for lower-paid workers.  If nothg. can be done in Budget, can’t defend opposing wage increases.  Fact is:  most of these men pay no direct taxation.  They are bound to be affected also by re-adjustmt of meat prices.



(R.S.C.	Not an over-all increase.)



E.B.	In Election I found a feeling of frustrn &amp; despair among lower paid people.  Can we by Budget make things cheaper for them?  If I was a T.U. leader now, I shd. say this is just the moment to press for big wage increases.  Leaders of to-day are trying to avoid cashing in:  but the strain on them is intolerable.

	Savings.  We have wrong idea.  During war we urged people to save for the day when they cd. buy consumer goods.  We can’t complain if they dis-save for this purpose now.  Who ever supposed net dis-saving cd. be avoided after war when houses &amp; furnishings became available.

	Cd. workers in savings groups be encouraged now for having establd homes out of savings.  Don’t gibe at them.

	Post war credits.  Hope R.S.C. will make a start on this.

	Beer.  Gravity as well as price is unsatisfactory.

	Concln:  I don’t challenge basis of R.S.C.’s approach this year.



H.M.	Rising rents?



J.G.	Yes in many areas.



H.W.	Ch.’s policy has bn. v. successful.  Only feasible mitigation note as recently implied by R.S.C. – weaken ’47 policy to small extent to find easements wh. wd. help to hold wage freeze.

	True tht. those affected don’t pay direct taxation.  And little in indirect taxn wh. we cd. alter – little purchase tax.



G.A.I.	Union leaders holdg. it better than we dared hope.

	Shipbldg. – demand for £1 p. wk. increase out of profits – has bn. played v. long by the leaders.  But men are waitg. to see Budget.  Unless somethg. can be done, can’t hold it any longer.  Won’t be able to secure even smaller increases w’out some Budget gesture.

	Lower-paid.  Can basis of taxn be so arranged as to avoid 9/= rate on over-time?

	Unions are re-assertg. control.

	Election – demand for lower c/living.

	Any indicn of let-up on wage-freeze means a big slide.  The employers won’t resist increases.



A.V.A.	Support policy of ’47 approach.

	Won’t discuss particular Budget proposals.

	But can’t get away fr. fact tht. country believes we are being over-taxed to finance capital investmt.  This is makg. the people whose work you want now discouraged.

	Gains fr. our capital schemes will continue.

	Ques. of principle.  Can we afford to reduce capital provided out of taxation. Believe we must.  Doubt if R.S.C. is right in saying tht. relief so afforded to lower groups won’t go into savings.  On Co-op experience, cdn’t accept that.

	Concln.  Continue cap. min p’mme but finance less from taxn.



R.S.C.	Where wd. savings come from to make up balance?



A.V.A.	From addl. income you leave to private individuals.



J.G.	We won Election on full emplt.  Mustn’t jeopardise that.

		Wd. undermine workers’ confidence in Govt.

	Workers wd. like to see some “give” in this Budget – to show we are beginning to win battle.

	Lower paid.  Major problem:  can we do anythg. in Budget to help T.U. leaders to hold some line on wage claims. (freeze can’t be m’tained). Diff. to do so in Budget for these 4/5 m. who don’t pay income tax.  £24 m. p.a. wd give extra 2/= on family allowances.



R.S.C.	Taxn is variable:  social benefits can never be put down.



J.G.	But psychol. value wd. be v. gt. – in helping to hold a new line.

	Purchase tax won’t help them either.



H.D.	Support main approach.

	But		a)   Plus &amp; minus, with same surplus, gives oppies for relief.

		      The goose has still some eggs.

b)	Tendency of advisers to under-estimate increase in productivity.  No evce of lack of incentive – for prodn is good.  ? Some margin here.

c)	Unemplt. is not zero.  para 7 refers to low level.  Don’t make concessions to Growther heresy.  Keep on re-butting it.  I believe unemplt. is rising dangerously. 



R.S.C.	No: the rise is seasonal – less than for 1949.



H.D.			d) For full emplt. we want some inflation, held in check by physical controls.

		We are a bit over the razor-edge.  Slight redn in surplus therefore to ensure tht. full emplt. is m’tained.



E.Sh.	Suggn tht. Budget concessions will help to preserve wage restraints.

		Depends on wtr. recipients consider concessions adequate.

		If you cd. increase f. allowances, reduce tax, take somethg. off beer &amp; tobacco &amp; increase food subsidies – applns for wage increases cd. be held.  But anythg. R.S.C. cd. do in practice wd. be so small they wd. have no effect on workers.

	My view is that wage claims will be made and pressed.  Esp. by lower-paid.

	Cap. investmt must be m’tained – for w’out it can’t m’tain social services or full emplt.

	At Elections, of course, all sorts of claims are pressed.  More petrol, cheaper coal, relaxn of bldg. controls.  They will press whatever concessions.  But no serious dissatisfn because we have m’tained full emplt.  Security means more than wages.

	Unless therefore redn of surplus can provide valuable concessions, leave it alone.



H.M.	Concessions are desirable.  To improve posn of T.U. leaders - &amp; socially desirable.

	Not enough recognised tht. value of social services shd. be included in real wages.

	Methods	a) Increased tax on rich.

         b) Reducg. Govt. expendre wh. is v. high.

	c) Reducg. below/line cap. expendre.  I see no other source 	    of money for concessions.



	Wages.  Sympathy with lower-paid.  But i) repercussions on higher-paid.  ii)  wage appln are not all fr. lower paid:  c.f. dockers &amp; busmen.  Teachers are having a raw deal – their startg. point is lower than dockers.

	If a new wages-spiral gets going, workers won’t benefit in long term because rising prices &amp; increased danger of inflation.  I wd. prefer therefore a real smack at prices.

	On main issue, R.S.C.’s approach is right.  He knows about £500 m needed for cap. investmt.  If we cut p’mme shall damage services.  A loan on market wd. prob. fail.  And unnecessary borrowing is bad because paymt./interest.  The service of the loans wd. affect Budget.  



A.B.	Nor wd. you get any more saving – only diversion.



H.M.	As planners we shd. pay our way.

	Tax relief since 1945 (Total £600 m).  Tried it out in Election.  Audience had not only forgotten but almost disbelieved it.



H.McN.	If any way of using part of surplus to divert wage claims, that wd. be good.  But if it isn’t a good gamble, don’t take it.

	Inclined to favour f. allowances as proper concession for the 4/5 m.

		On Clyde hardship is being felt because rising prices.

		In my Divs. last quarter as many applicants refused offer of houses as accepted them.  Shows things are tight. For average ship-yard worker puts good housing high in priority.

	If  R.S.C. thinks f. allowances + food subsidy has a chance of holdg. wage-freeze, take the risk.

H.G.	Three points –

a)	Must be some guess-work in estimatg. amount of necessary surplus.  But unemplt. may arise fr. failure to solve b/paymts. problem, as well as fr. deflation.  And risk of E.R.P. ending before ’52.  That comes into balance – v. riskg. inflationary situation.

b)	Conflict betwn. desire to help lower-paid &amp; pol. advantages of helping black-coated middle classes.

c)	W’spread disposn in H/C. to expect quite a lot fr. this Budget for pol. reasons.  Risk of people expectg. too much.  Ty. Diffies aren’t enough realised.



G.T.	Under-paid have changed.  Those so described 3 yrs. ago are no longer under-paid.  This explains part of b).

	R.S.C. has justified our policy.  My case at Election: if you want the things we provide you must pay for them.

		And people will take that.



R.S.C.	This = new opportunity.  Discussg. Budget policy in advance.

		Glad of it.  Won’t be expected to say how it has influenced my mind.

	Lower-paid.  Budget relief v. wasteful method of helping them.

	Tewson:  don’t have a Budget wh. may give imptn of full emplt. policy is jeopardised.



E.B.	Can we build a special reserve v. 1952?  Diffy of annual Budgets.

	Cd. we describe part of surplus as contributg. to that reserve?

		People want to be independent.



R.S.C.	Over a series of years Budget shd. be in balance.

		We have accumulated big surpluses in past years.

		They entitle us in future years to run a deficit.  So they are a reserve.
