C.M.  42 (49)					23rd June, 1949



1.	    Parliament.



H.M.	Hairdressers (Regulation) Bill.

	Amended, but still objectionable.  Any real difficies shd. be handled under P. Health Acts.  Cdn’t raise it at Party mtg. – not enough there. No precedent for Govt. Whips being used, save where Govt. have virtually taken Bill over.



W.W.	Except on our ques. of major principle re children, whips never used.

	Are seeing Govt. supporters.



H.M.	Business for next week.



J.	Awkward if Hairdressers throw Bill out.  Pity for H/L to show only sense.



A.B.	Disgraceful record for our Party.



A.	Wd. prefer to have Whips on rather than leave H/L. to reject it.



A.B.	Danger is:  may be carried by small House.



W.W.	Whips are seeing each his own group.  Doing our best.





2.	     Boundary Commission.



A.B.	Met Eve etc. expld Cab. decn.  Replied v. awkward to wind up.

		Diff. to take duties seriously m’while.  Shdn’t Govt. make a statement of their intentions.  Propose answer to P.Q. – must now be on Friday.  Will it suffice to have a written answer.



P.M.	Mon. or Tuesd. next week wd. be early enough.



H.M.	Too important for a writer.



A.B.	There is a Bill coming – opportunity for discn.



P.M.	Draft answer was pretty cold:  no acknowledgemt. of their work.



			Agreed:  statement after Ques. early next week.





3.	    Import Policy.



H.W.	Expected pressure for statement hasn’t matured.  No announcement in Paris.

	Robertson&apos;s discns with Dpt.: wants statemt. p’poned until after Canadian election (Monday).

	When R.S.C. returns fr. Brussels re-consider.  Prob. Tues/Wed of next week.



			General agreement.



T.W.	Cd. interested Dpt. see draft m’while.



H.W.	Yes.





4.	    Mountbatten Estate Bill.

		                                                                [Enter Att. G. &amp; Gl. Hall



J.	Restraints on anticipn now archaic. &amp; out of harmony with status of women.

	Attitude – as in memo.

	Unless Ty. objected.  But they don’t want to object on revenue grounds.

	Procedure in H/L semi-judicial.  Explained it.  W’out precedent for a Personal Bill approved by H/L. to be opposed by H/C.  Shd. be reluctant to see this happen.

	Believe if Govt. can say they support this Bill &amp; any genl. legn doing same for all, Conservative Opposn would not be pressed.

	Enough for us to promise support for any other Bill.  No need to promise general legln.



P.M.	M’battens spent much money in India.

	This is a prob.  Die-Hard line.



H.M.	No time for general legn. in this Parlt. probably.



Att.G.	Favour this Bill:  wrong to oppose it.  But if debated, some of our supporters may raise P-War Credits.  Genl. case for abolishing there restraints – e.g. to raise money for children’s educn.  Our clause – non-controversial Bill.  I wd. prefer to present such a Bill at once &amp; get M’batten Bill w’drawn.  Just as quick &amp; wd. avoid all awkward discussion on M’batten’s affairs.



G.A.I.	Supported this view.



Att.G.	Ty. wdn’t object to general legn.



A.W.	Genl. legn will be misrepresented as designed to help the rich to spend more money.



Att.G.	Only 50-100 cases, and not all rich people.



A.B.	Support Att. Genl.’s proposal.  On basis of sex equality, not to enable capital to be spent.



N.B.	Supported.  Trouble with our own supporters.



			Agreed: As proposed by Att. Genl.  Introduce in H/Lords.



H.M.	Try to square Opposn &amp; Govt. supporters first.



J.	Will get Bill prepared [&amp; bring it to Legn Cttee].



Att.G.	Treat as minor legal reform. – don’t consult Party mtg.

	Introduce at once &amp; let M’batten Bill be w’drawn.



J.	Get early 1st reading in H/L.

			                                                       [Exit Att. Genl. &amp; W.W.

			                                          [Enter C.O.S. &amp; 3 Serv. Ministers

5.	    Hong Kong.



A.V.A.	As in memo  C.P. 134.



C.J.	All recommns in memo. are now in hand.



E.B.	Trouble in China is coming, as I expected, from Kuomintang.  Mustn’t be obsessed by need to reach accommn with Communists only.  There are still other strong forces in China.



	C.O. Memo.



C.J.	Diff. to reply to U.S. ques.  Made tentative suggns.  But really raises whole ques. of H. Kong’s future.  Coalition Govt. decided to leave it until after the war.  Situation has radically changed – needs new review.

		Can’t talk publicly about it, if we want to m’tain morale in Colony.

		Diffy.:  New Territories will have to go, yet they are prob. essential to Island’s development.

	Our posn will be challenged.  Recommend we shd. consider long-term future w’out delay – in confidence.



	Dom Replies



N.B.	As satisfy. as we cd. have hoped, save for Australia.

	Since memo,

		a) Fraser has sent a lemon to Chifley – unwavering.

		b) Recd assurance tht. Austr. wdn’t take ques. to Security 

		    Council w’out consultg. us.

		c) Chifley has hinted tht. if a real crisis developed their attitude 

		    on material help might change. 

		d) Asked N.Z. for 3 Dakotas + crews &amp; groundstaff.

	Haven’t yet told Doms. of conversations with Acheson.



E.B.	Don’t want to answer State Dpt. ques.

	F.D.R. wanted us to give H. Kong back to China during the war.

	U.S. haven’t made much success of China – don’t know which way they go.

	What worries me most is Austr.  Hope C.R.O. will be v. firm tht. there is no ques. to go to Sec. Council.  And, if there were, it wd. be for us to refer it, not them.  



N.B.	They have given categorical assurance.

	I could have settled Indonesia if Evatt hadn’t referred it to Sec. Council.

		Even in the end, it was I who pulled chestnuts out of fire.



N.B.	I’m sure tht. in a crunch they wd. be behind us.

	And they are sound on moral support.

	Mght. be useful to send another apprecn to A., in light of A.V.’s visit.

		Will propose draft with F.O. and M/D.



P.M.	Don’t answer U.S.A.

                    x/	Let E.B. &amp; C.J. submit memo to S.E.A. Cttee on long-term future of H. Kong.



A.B.	Can we dodge fact tht. we offered to Ch. Kai Shek to review future after war?  As soon as settled Govt. matures, we can’t refuse to discuss with them.  Under oblign therefore to study the ques.

	Can we indefinitely p’pone answering Acheson’s ques.?

	We aren’t really solid in Commonwealth on this.  We might get  morally isolated.



H.D.	We shd. make up our minds on Acheson’s ques.

	India is really no good to us on this.  Their reference to Burma etc., means “get out”.



E.B.	U.K. will have to handle this.  Austr. is frightened of it.  Apart fr. N. Z. we are alone.  Must decide what out attitude shall be when we are approached.

	Expect Hague Confce on Indonesia in July.

				[Enter Barnes

				[Exit Gl. Hall.



A.B.	No diffce of opinion on decn to re-inforce &amp; resist armed aggression.

	But this alone is too negative.  We need a position policy for the future because we can’t hang on by force v. sustained hostility of China.

	Shd. we not prepare to make pretty soon a position statemt. e.g. tht. when the settled Ch. Govt. appears we shall be willing to discuss with them future of Island.





P.M.	Can’t say it now:  for Chiang K. Sh. is still recogn. Govt.  

			Agreed: as at x/.





6.	    China:  Bombing of ss. Anchises.



E.B.	Recent message from Chinese in Canton expressing regret, and assuring us this isn’t connected with order to blockade Shanghai.

	Wd. like C.O.S. &amp; F.O. to consult before we confirm order to fire.



B.	M/T. wd, also like time to get more informn from the Lines.

	C.O.S. recognise tht. ships now go here at own risk.



A.B.	Confusion locally.



E.B.	Suggest F.E. (O) Cttee should meet and formulate policy – now we are being attacked by both sides.

	Para. 9 (a) may be approved now.  Para 9 (b) must be considered.

		C-in-C must be told to suspend 9 (b) pro-tem.



C.N.S. 	We want permn fr. local Comm forces tht. H.M. ships can go to help of B. or other ships attacked by aircraft.  Otherwise reflects seriously on R.N.  Wd. be wrong to enter Whangpoo river w’out permission.



			Agreed:  F.E. (O) Cttee to review &amp; report to S.E.A. Cttee.



				[Exit Barnes.

7.	    China:  Release of H.M.S. Amethyst..



H.	Proposals put fwd. by Chinese General.

	“intruded indiscreetly.”  Becket said this wd. prejudice us in any compensation discussions.  Even “unfortunately entered” wd. do so.

	But crews have suffered a good deal.  Getting some food from the land.

		Parcels are now coming to them thro’ mails.

	Attitude of Comms. has changed.  They haven’t raised apologies, compensn etc. now.  Can we find a formula?



J.	 Why not offer to say “entered” w’out permission.



A.V.A.	This admn wd. mean climbing down on support earlier given to C-in-C. etc.

	Ty. don’t care about financial ques. so far as our claim goes:  doesn’t want to admit a heavy Chinese claim.



		Agreed:  F.O. to seek a formula which will free the ship &amp; not commit H.M.G. overmuch in compensn claims – leave 

				               it open to argue later.

8.	    Soviet War Potential.



E.B..	Bears out C.O.S. basis of war-planning – 1957 or later.



H.M.	Must mean tht. Soviet can afford their level of military strength by keeping level of living down.  With us, we are doing the opposite.

		Pity we can’t get it across to Soviet Public tht. they are being ground down to levels lower than those which Hitler imposed.



P.M.	Also capital investment.  Tho’ promised land has bn. deferred for a long time.



A.B.	Wanted this as b’ground for discussg. our defence needs.  Steel is most vital thing for war: &amp; on steel Soviet comes out v. badly on this memo.

		Steel condns not only mil. equipmt. but also skilled personnel – also rate of steel prodn expansion.

	P.S., third para.  V. optimistic.  Low consumptn limits expansion of prodn.

	They cd. move men more rapidly into war sector, because underdeveloped economy.

		But they wd. be men ill-armed.



N.B.	 All tables show relative Soviet weakness.  Oil, especially:  and oil-field vulnerable.



A.V.A.	Para. 15 on p.12 corrects A.B.’s point.

	Soviet can m’tain what they have &amp; build up as Germany did in ’39.

	Remember they move fr. interior lines.



C.A.S.	They need less industrial steel.  cf. Japan – a formidable war effort on no more than 8m. tons.



A.V.A.	Stress on vulnerability of R. oil only underlines importance of M/East.



E.B.	Tho’ casualty costs were v. heavy R. achieved v. much in last war on about 2 tones of steel per man – as cpd. with about 16 by U.S.



E.Sh.	Our intelligence sources know v. little about Russia.

	Take this rpt. with grain of salt.

	Cdn’t we get more informn.

	Wd. be dangerous to assume anything about their intentions &amp; capacity from this document.

	Don’t think it’s safe even to suppose they cdn’t make war till ’57.



E.B.	Agree.  Only safety is in being well prepared &amp; equipped.



A.B.	That begs the ques. too.  How well-prepared?



P.M.	Must distinguish in that argument betwn. equipmt. and potential.



E.Sh.           y/	If R. cared to use what she has to-day, she cd. go thro’ to Atlantic.

		That’s not assumption.  And “potential” isn’t much comfort in reply to that.



A.B.	I don’t accept military view on y/.

	If it’s true, C.D. prepns are useless.



J.	This memo suggests to me tht. development of Air Force is answer.
