C.M. 11(49)							10th February 1949



		1.	Blood Sports Bills.			[Enter W.W., E.Sh.



H.M.	Two Bills a) fox hunting  b) more general including coursing, but not foxes.



	H.O. have helped in drafting a clause – without prejudice.

	Do we wish in principle to avoid getting involved in this controversy. Predominantly a farmers’ recreation – not aristocrats!



T.W.	Govt. shd. not support at all.

	Diff. to keep down deer by shooting or poisoning.

	Purely rural recreation – part of rural life.  Little point in cruelty point – as cpd. eg. with Jewish slaughter house.  Much exaggerated.

	Destn of this traditional feature of country life wd. undo all the good we have done by our agricultural policy.

	Awkward if we let it pass H/C and H/L turn it out.  Tories wd. then get all the credit in rural areas.



C.E.	Support T.W. largely. Two approaches  a) There is some cruelty, tho’ amount is exaggerated.   b) Traditional rural life.   b) is strongest argument v. Bill.

	Strong Labour vote (fr. urban members) in favour is likely.  Majority of Party will prob. vote for it.  Bill shd. be opposed by M/Ag. not H.O. (Agreed).



H.D.	Height of political lunacy to bring these Bills fwd. just before Election.



P.M.	Means legislating in advance of public opinion.	[Enter Gl. Hall.

	Cruelty case at least as strong v. shooting.



H.W.	Does Coursing Bill extend to animals other than hares? 



T.W. 	Yes.



W.W.	Cdn’t talk this out – Spkr. wd. accept closure after 5 yrs.

	Party mtg. guidance will be necessary.  Many of our people are asking for guidance from Govt.			

    [Exit C.E., T.W.



		2.	Private Members’ Bills.



W.W.	Arrangements in hand : for Employers.

	Slaughter of Animals Bill is ok. and cd. go thro’ on the nod.



A.B.	Drafting. Analgesia Bill.  We can’t find midwives.  Materials not available.

	We have given technical help.  Better do that – even if we are going to oppose in principle.

P.M.	No reason against giving facilities in reason.

	Will give general guidance.





		3.	Parliament.



H.M.	Business for next week.



P.M.	W.S.C. wants Parly. time to discuss Govt. attitude on European Assembly.

	Tell him he can take a supply day and put a vote of censure.



H.M.	A good point – but premature.



W.W.	Better for us to say “handle thro usual channels”.



E.B.	Cuts across internatl negotns : pressure to discuss Atlantic Pact before it is concluded.  Can’t resist that if you yield to W.S.C. on this.

	This demand shd. therefore be rejected on principle.



P.M.	We must stand firm on this.



A.B.	Don’t cut down unduly right of Opposn to try to influence Govt. decisions before they are reached.  But no need for Govt. to find the time for it.



P.M.	But we can and do say we won’t decide prematurely.



H.D.	They can put down F.O. Vote on a supply day.

								           [Exit W.W.



		4.	War Graves.



E.Sh.	Constitutionally for Imp. W. Graves Commn.  But brought to Cab. because of political interest.



	Outlined earlier history – as in memo.

	Latest proposal seems reasonable.  Must be compromise because of diff. policy of U.S. and U.K. on repns.  (Since 1.1.49. have agreed that bodies may be repatriated to U.K. at expense of relatives : may give some trouble because of discrimination on basis of private means. Doesn’t, however, arise on this memo).



	Political consequences.

P.M.	Dom. dead in their graves?



E.Sh.	Doms. repd on Commn and accept this policy.

	Political consns.	a)  disagree with U.S. – and it’s awkward.

				b)	agree with U.S. – will provoke demand 				for repatn. of U.K. dead. Shall 					have to face that out.

P.M.	Is there strong demand?



E.Sh.	Fair volume – tho’ dying off.



	Cost: £90 from B.A.O.R. to Lpl. St. for a single body. Am trying to get contractors to reduce cost.



P.M.	Sorry we departed ………   



E.Sh. 	We haven’t.



	Memo endorsed.





		5.	Statement on Defence.



A.V.A.		Rising expenditure because of emergency p’mme. of last autumn.

						increased pay (£12 m.)

	Proportionate increase shown in paras. on Finance., esp. § 29.  One third of increase due to increased pay-wage and supply costs.

	Civilian emplt. Annex I. – showg. increases.  To meet Parly. demand for more informn.  Similarly Annex II.

	M/S. have asked for adjustmt. in para. 6 of Annex II because they think too much detail is given.

	H.W. has raised security point on para. 6 of memo.  “The commando brigade …. the beach brigade” show only one.  Will consider substitution of “a”.



A.W.	Dispersal of war production (in U.K.) Is anything being done?



A.V.A.	A matter for J.W.P.S.  Memo. coming to Def. Cttee.



A.B.	“Never was peace preserved so expensively as now”.  What hemispherical studies are being made?  Commn. makg. progress only in rural communities.

	And Sov. dispose of [only] …. m. tons of steel prodn.  200 m. + 60/100 m. satellites.  Those masses (not including China) are mobilised.

	16 m. tons was last I.L.O. figure.

	We have 120/130 m. at our disposal in the west.  And technical skill.

	Can’t this be studied?  To show what, with most meagre allowance for peace economy, is requd. and available for war.



P.M.	Shd. be studied.  A good point.

	But our cost = m’taining. troops abroad with adminve tails in a cold war.  Fought, not with masses of steel, but with guerrillas.



	Believe R. equipmt. must be obsolescent : short of m. t.

	R. potential can be easily exaggerated.

	But our Comm. dispersal exposes wide flank.

	Also expre on v. long term research and development on new types.



A.W.	Para. 27. People crowdg. into B’ham and defence prodn expanding there, while unemploymt. on Mersey and Clyde.

	Man power implicns shd. be examined.

	Dispersal shd. be considered.



P.M.	D.I. Cttee considers strategic consns.



H.W.	Prodn Cttee. have also asked M/S. for memo. on this.



A.V.A.	Better dispersed now than in 1939.  Register of war potential is now being prepared.



A.V.A.	Para. 47.  Ty. want amended wording to emphasise tht. objectives were reached (civilian man power) in 1st half year.



P.M.	If you make the point at all, make it clear.



E.Sh.	This para. relates mainly to civilians via mil. man power. (not primarily prodn.  To train efficiently (and sustained) we must employ civilians on chores.  R.S.C. objects, however, on ground tht. this is “as new service”.  He can’t have it both ways.  We have a civilian man power ceiling : and an estimate : but must be allowed to manoeuvre within those.



E.B.	Services shd. absorb on these duties most of them disabled men.

	[General support for E.Sh. view.]



	Draft Paper approved.
