C.M. 9 (50)					9th March, 1950



1.	    Parliament.

					         [Enter W.W.



P.M.	Division on Steel.  Liberals may vote with Tories.  Tight situation.



W.W.	Two of our supporters ill.



R.S.C.	Some Tories are ill.



P.M.	M/S. was to open and H.D. reply.



H.M.	That can stand.

	May be asked on Business if we shall take this as confidence.  Shall say ‘yes’.



H.D.	If this is 1st challenge to Govt. prs. P.M. shd. reply.

	Firm line?  No sign of compromise or deal with Liberals.  



			Agreed.  P.M. to speak last.



P.M.	If we shd. be beaten, we shdn’t ask for Dissolution.  Respons. of W.S.C. to carry on.  Shall say this in debate.



R.S.C.	Cdn’t have Election now because financial business.



			Discn on this adjourned.



H.McN.	Demand for establmt. of facts re revenue &amp; expre posn.  Cd. I say we were considering that?  



P.M. 	Inclined to favour that.



R.S.C.	Wd. be major undertakg.:  wd. take years &amp; masses of staff.  



P.M.	Cd. reconsider Goschen formula.



R.S.C.	Don’t get committed on this.  Let’s have a memo. for Cabinet.



J.G.	Cove’s speech &amp; article in D. Herald. 



W.W.	He is going to speak.



H.M.	Next week’s business.



	Supplementaries.  On going into Cttee of Supply Opposn will move censure of failure of R.S.C. to enforce his decision r. Supplementaries.  S.O. 17.  A.B. + Parly. Secy. with R.S.C. intervening.

			Agreed:  R.S.C. to intervene &amp; A.B. to wind up.

	

	Will Cab. be told what A.B.’s line is to be?



A.B.	Not ready.



P.M.	Will discuss next week.



E.B.	Cab. scrutiny of Health Service not so close as e.g. over Defence?



R.S.C.	Cab. agreed to Bill wh. gives much looser method to financial control.  This must now be changed.  Proposals will be put to Cabinet.  



P.M.	Cabinet Monday.  Memo. to be circulated in advance, showing existg. system &amp; changes proposed.





	Steel (resumed).



H.M.	M/S., speech is firm.  No sign of w’drawal.



H.D.	He shd. say nothing re diffies of apptg. Corpn.

		Time will cure this &amp; Election before Oct.



P.M.	But don’t give impn tht. M/S. will be approachg. individuals.  That wd. be unrealistic.  Nor must we give impn now that we expect Election in the summer.



H.M.	Dissolution.  On Parly tactics I believe full diffies of Election shd. be faced.

	Don’t think our posn in Opposn wd. be easy.  And they wdn’t have a majority at all.



A.	Support H.M.



E.B.	Also.



A.	Respons. for forcing Dissoln is heavy - let Tories take it.  Don’t let us get into Opposn &amp; accept that responsibility thereafter.



P.M.	King might not grant Dissoln.



E.Sh.	If W.S.C. formed Govt., he wd. have to put his p’mme to House.  We shd. have to challenge it.  If we defeated him, where wd. we be then?



J.	Mustn’t indicate in advance what advice P.M. wd. give to King.



E.B.	On public opinion – thought W.S.C. is playing the fool.  Desire tht. Parlt. shdn’t be made laughing-stock.  Apart fr. Party, feeling tht. Parlt. &amp; constitution shd. be treated responsibly.

	If W.S.C. formed Govt., we shd. be in posn of throwg. him out &amp; of upsettg. stability.

	Our genl line shd. be – narrow majority, we have put aside contentious matter, so as to carry on King’s Govt.  Steel ques. isn’t immediate:  W.S.C. wd. be irresponsibly preventg. King’s Govt.  fr. being carried on.

		If he did, I wd. favour appeal to country.

	To-days debate.  Shd. like P.M. to make point re King’s Govt. and m’taining stability.  If that is to be prevented by fractious action, “only the people can decide.”



H.M.	I agree.



R.S.C.	Agree with sentiment &amp; tht. we shdn’t force immedte election.

		But if we advise Dissoln, can be said it’s our responsibility.

		Financial business.  Things wh. must be done by 31/3. – to provide money in Consol. Fund.  Budget &amp; Fin. Bill resolns must be thro’ by May to enable taxation to continue.



H.D.	Endorse E.B.’s line.  But take more time to think this	[Exit J.

	over.  This is hypothetical at present.  We shall have to face it later. Let’s think a bit more.

				                  

H.M.	Want Parlt. to know they are risking trouble.

		Don’t want Party in opposn in this Parliament.





	Business for next week.



H.M.	Now hear tht. on Wed 15/3 Opposn want discn on Control of Engagemt. Order.  Govt. must now decide policy.



G.A.I.	Expld position.



P.M.	We cd. discuss on Monday.



H.M.	If we are going to w’draw it, prefer to say so quick on P.Q.



E.B.	The Order is useless.  Why not get rid of it?



R.S.C.	Statement after Ques. to-day – saying was going to do this anyway apart fr. P.Q.





			Agreed.





	Attendance at Ballet.



P.M.	Ladies to go:  &amp; Members to follow.

	Ministers shd. inform Palace.





2.	    Agricultural Prices

				    [Exit W.W.

P.M.	Announced decn reached.	[Enter M.W., H.G.



		   Agreed.





3.	    De-rationing of Feeding Stuffs.



R.S.C.	P’pone this (?) &amp; consider it with marginal land scheme.



T.W.	On marginal land &amp; fertilisers jointly?



R.S.C.	Yes.



T.W.	De-rationing.  Daren’t do it yet.  Must wait.



A.V.A.	Para. 5.  If you do this, will you get enough control over farmers’ cropping.



T.W.	Watching that.  Bonus on deliveries.



H.W.	This is right decn.  But cd. M/F. report early how much animal food is going bad.  We can never de-ration because can’t see supplies 18 mos. ahead – shall we ever?  And to play safe we pile up stocks wh. go bad.



R.S.C.	Immedte extension of rations mustn’t be taken as guarantee of supplies.  Failure in Argentine.  



T.W.	Covered by para. 6.





4.	    Housing.



a)    L.a.’s Waiting Lists.



A.B.	Explained.



R.S.C.	Para 10 (1)  “… has turned out in the post-war circs. to be …”



A.B.	Was an under-estimate then.

	Based on assumptn tht. there was no housing problem pre-war.

		But I will accept R.S.C’s formula.

R.S.C.	Para 10 (2).  Alternative, bringing out other forms of investment.

		“… having regard to the country’s economic situation and the need for other desirable forms of investment…”



P.M.	Not “investment” – too technical.



A.B.	Para 10 (2) as it stands … as possible… gives the qualificn  I will add:  “having regard to available national resources.”



H.D.	Don’t back down on Housing.  Most important for next Election.



T.W.	Omit “preliminary” in para. 10.



			Agreed.



R.S.C.	Para. 11.  Agreed:  “that global estimates cannot usefully be made except by …”



A.	Why haven’t you tumbled to all this earlier?  You’ll be asked.

		What will you say?



A.B.	Leave it to me.  I can cope with this in H/C.



H.McN.	Addn must be made for Scotland.  Ministers to agree.



	b)    Houses for Sale.



A.B.	Time has come to spike Opposn guns &amp; introduce more flexibility.

	Provide consumer choice, as betwn. letting &amp; buying, at top of waitg. list.

	In many Labour areas, no-one will want to buy.

	But in S. and S.E., it wd. give some scope for buying houses.



H.McN.	No consultn – with me or my Dpts.

	Want more flexibility, &amp; more discretion to l.a.’s.  But want time to consider method.  Risk tht. some l.a.’s might go too far with houses for sale.  Might want to vary appln of this to Scotland.



H.M.	Bring it up at Monday’s Cabinet if Scotland not content.

	Why not give free discretion to l.a.’s?  



A.B. &amp; others.	Too dangerous – Tory Councils wdn’t build to let at all.



R.S.C.	A.B.’s method only works if the waiting list is settled on merits.

		But can you trust them?



H.D.	No.  Tory Councils wd. pack the lists.

		Prefer to increase the proportion.



A.B.	My plan will result in fewer houses being built for sale.		

		The people on the waitg. lists won’t want to buy.

		This is a paper concession only.  And politically advantageous.



C.E.	Disagree.  L.a.’s in Tory areas wd. cook the lists.



R.S.C.	Use M/H. formula but put ceiling of ⅓ rd for sale.



A.B.	Can’t combine the 2 principles.  Wd. sooner w’draw my proposal.



			Memo withdrawn.



P.M.	These pp. on Housing shd. be concerted with S/S. Scotlnd.  Let us have more joint memoa in future.





5.	    Economic Situation..



R.S.C.	Object was to enable Ministers to put suggns to me.

	Wd. they care to submit them individually?



A.	I wd. be content with that procedure.



H.M.	One genl. point – don’t lose grip.
