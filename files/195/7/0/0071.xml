C.M. 8 (50)					6th March, 1950



1.	    Agricultural Prices.

			                                                            [Enter M. Webb., H.G.

T.W.	Explained main points in memo.

	Rising trend of efficiency &amp; valuations.  Some part of this ought to go to Ty. and consumer.  Justificn for the £201/2 m.

	Review covers 75% of total prodn.  No recoupment. provided for non-review products.  This includes domestic pig &amp; poultry keepers.

	Memo provides reasonable starting point for discussions.

	Diffy:  farms differ.  E.g. South Lancs. farmers who can’t grow cattle feed.  These points must be covered as they come up.



P.M.	Even so, farmers will get more than £250 m. wh. was considered proper target income – even by Farmers’ Union.



T.W.	Increased valuation of livestock.



P.M.	Doesn’t affect point.



R.S.C.	i) Last year £249 m. was taken as v. generous income.  Prices were put too high &amp; farmers got £281/2 m more than we intended.  This memo. perpetuates that.

	ii) The £40 m. p.a. for 4 yrs. to 1952 – can’t be stopped in one blow, must be tapered off.  Shd. start now, if we are to complete it at £200 m.

		Shd. come down to at least £30 m.  Go on longer:  but spread the £200 m. over more than 5 years.



P.M.	In fact we have given more than £40 m. p.a. on prices;  &amp; farmers have invested more than £40 m in capital.



R.S.C.	Take £209 m. as proper income.  Add £30 m. (or whatever is decided as proper figure for tapering of the £40 m.).  Take result as basis for fixing prices.

	Then find a way of helping marginal farmer.



T.W.	280.000 farmers betwn. 1 and 100 acres.

	Psychological approach as well as statistical.



R.S.C.	With a good plan for marginal land, I wd. give more than T.W. proposes for that.

	Feeding stuff subsidy = I propose tht. whole of £37 m. shd. be met by farmers .

		(T.W. proposes £20 m. by farmers and £17 m. by consumers.)



E.Sh.	Para 10?



R.S.C.	Inevitable, now we’ve decided to remove subsidies.

M.W.	Other aspects wh. will have to be considered.

		We may have to face £42 m. increase in food prices because subsidy ceiling.

	M/F. are ready to agree tht. somethg. shd. be done for farmers to m’tain supplies.  Perhaps £10 m. wd. be my guess.  Cdn’t risk complete recoupment.



H.McN.	Must try to support T.W.

	£200 m. over 5 years is a firm contract.

	Increased income last year.  White Paper didn’t grudge increased income due to increased prodn.

	Awkward if we have to suggest reduced income + spread-over of capital injection.

	Wd. be v. diff. to put this over in Scotland, where many are small livestock producers.



P.M.	Why shd. farmers get a reward for capital expansion for wh. Govt. provided the money?



E.B.	Why shd. increased efficiency mean increased prices?



H.M.	Is consumer getting his share?



A.B.	What increase in farmers’ property in last 4 years?



E.Sh.	Effect?  Do we want prodn still further increased?



H.D.	We said in Election 150% increase by 1952.  Now 133%.



H.W.	Lower prices might call forth greater effort.  To earn same amount.



P.M.	Why do you suggest (para. 14) going up fr. £249 to £261 m?



T.W.	Increased valuation wd. = £10 m.



P.M.	Why (in para. 14) depart from last years’ agreed £209 m. and go back to gross up the £2041/2 m. of 1946/7.



H.W.	This plan means £17 m. more to consumer = ½ point on c/living.



E.B.	I believe it’s too much.  I think farmers cd. stand the lot (£37 m.).

		Settle in 3/rds.  10/11 m. on consumer.

		Throw more in on marginal land.



H.D.	More on marginal land:  split the farmers.



			Discn adjourned.







2.	    Seretse Khama..



			Agreed:  subject to L.O. being consulted.
