C.M. 23(49)							28th March 1949



							[Enter E.Sh., A.H., &amp; Dugdale



		1.	Demobilisation Clothing for N.S. Men.



A.V.A.	Jan. ’47 : war time scheme brought to an end and announced.

	No repns at the time.  Entrants had 2 yrs. to go and didn’t think ahead.

	Extn. of service to 2¼ yrs : and loss of value of 60 coupon issue : led to repns and troubles when men began to come out after 1.1.49.

	Out-grown their clothes : had saved us money : demob. pay less than during war.  We said : warning given in ’47 and men informed by notice on calling-up.

	Adminve machinery dispersed.  Its re-creation wd. be v. costly.  Any concessn now made must be by grant in aid.  Ques: shd. it given, and how much?

	If principle is conceded, I admit demand will be pressed for higher amount. £15/20 is said to be needed.  At £20 it wd. be £3 m. p.a. on Service Votes – which we can’t meet.

	Much pressure by P.Q. and M.P. letter.  Fear it will be m’tained.

	Service Ministers support £5 as compromise.  40 M.P. lrs.



D.	Admy. have had 30/40 lrs.



R.S.C.	Third attempt by Services to get Supplementary.  Wasn’t raised on main Estimates.  Can’t agree to any addn to maximum of £760 m.

	On merits : 1947 decision was correct.  Circs. v. diff. fr. those of war-time service – v. special circs.  Natural there shd. be protest at moment of change of system.  We can’t give way to that kind of pressure.

	No objn if Services do the £1 m. by virement.



A.V.A.	If Cab. approved in principle, Service Ministers wd. say they cdn’t guarantee to find money w’out eventual supplementaries.



E.Sh.	On merits we ought to do this.  £5 isn’t enough, but it’s a gesture.

	Man outgrows civilian clothing.  Parents find it diff. to provide the money.



P.M.	If you concede the principle, you can’t hold it at £5.



A.B.	There is a logical case for doing nothing.  Pay is related to average civilian earnings, taking a/c of what is found.  Once you admit there is a case, you will be driven up to cost of full wardrobe.



P.M.	cf. apprentice.  



R.S.C. 	30-40/= p. wk. with all found = Service pay.



H.W.	Compared with civilians, what N.S. man has left in his pocket is favourable. eg. £170-£190 of C.O. less tax : can he have 40/= in his pocket.



A.V.A.	Rations have bn. reduced.  N.S. men don’t get pay-improvemts. conceded to regulars.



G.A.I.	18 days release have + ration allowance on demobilisn.



R.S.C.	They keep underclothing etc.



H.D.	Sympathise with claim.  Hope Service Ministers will do it w’in existing Votes.

	Influenced by disgruntlement of men leaving Services.

	Doubtless they will ask for more than £5.



N.B.	Agree it must come out of Votes.

	Argument at end para. 6. is important if true.



R.S.C.	£2 p. wk. spending money for 2 yrs. shd. give chance to save enough to buy a suit.



A.B.	Anyhow, they aren’t all orphans.

	The exceptional case can be handled by Assistance Bd.

	Mustn’t make a general grant to meet exceptional cases.



H.W.	Consider issue in kind not money – if you must do it.

	Offer £5 in cash : it will be treated as derisory.

	Bulk orders, tax free – wd. go further and cd. be held.



E.Sh.	Adminve cost wd. be v. high.  We won’t do it.



H.M.	A chit system vice cash grant.

	Leave it to Service Ministers to decide w’in Estimates.  But ask them to consider A.B.’s argument.

	H/C. won’t leave it at £5.



R.S.C.	Let a man put aside 2/= a week and let State make it up to £10.

	Wd. encourage thrift.



A.V.A.	Cd. only work on future cases.



P.M. 	Service Ministers can find a way of doing this fr. Estimates.



A.H.	Can’t find £350.000.  Wd. prefer adverse decn. by Cabinet.



A.V.A.	If it can’t be met w’in Estimate, much to be said for doing nothing.

	If it is done : we must all stick to £5 limit.



	Agreed: (No additional expenditure on this.

		  (Service Ministers to consider, in light of discn what they cd. 	  (do w’in Estimates.





2.	Economic Report.	[Exit Service repves.  Enter H.G., B., G.S.



a)  Man Power.  Increased unemplt. figures.  No substantial increase in 

     hard core.  Holiday towns – unemplt. pay in winter.



b)  Production.  Cotton yarn disapptg.  



H.W. 		Parly Secy. Is visiting.  B’neck on weaving, not yarn.



		c)  Coal.  O.m.s. is up.  But so is absenteeism.



		Invol. absenteeism up by 2% since increased N.I. benefit in July.  M/L 	and M/N.I. are enquiring into that,

	Output higher than assumed.  But don’t count eggs.  Over whole year 2-3% improvemt. via 5%.  O.m.s. overall has bn. running at 5% better than last year.

	Stocks – larger stocks of poorer qualities.



d)	Steel.  Pig-iron has got stuck. Fall in home scrap may mean trouble

      over time. 		



	No immedte cause for alarm.  Para.12 – won’t be above 500.000.



R.S.C.	Not a collapse – a failure to m’tain expansion.  Hoped we cd. do more.



G.S.	No cause for immediate anxiety.



H.W.	Delay in negotns for Indian pig-iron v. steel from U.K.

	Cd. that be expedited?



G.S.	Fedn are handling it.  G.S. and N.B. to enquire into this.



		e)  Motors.

H.W.	Diffies now in U.S. Switching – esp. to Canada.  Increased propn to hard currency markets is expected.



	Shipping 6’ weeks.



G.S.	Fords and Austins can’t do so well because U.S. cars available.

	Other firms – to other markets – are doing v. well.



		f)  Exports.

H.M.	Genl. level of exports falling?



H.W.	No: Feb. shows seasons fall.  And Jan. was specially lucky.

	But in many markets we are feeling draft, on orders.

	155% end/49 target.  Few new records can be expected.



		g)  N/Payments.

		Belgium : adverse balance continues, tho’ Belgians more co-operative.



		h)  Prices.

R.S.C.		Sign. fall in zinc prices.



H.D.	U.S. eg living has bn. falling for 5 months.



R.S.C.	Reflection of drop in farm produce prices.  At peak in July ’46.

	Quick re-action on U.S. c/living.

	Doesn’t affect our subsidies because we aren’t buying from U.S.



		i)  Dollar-earning of Colonies.

R.S.C.	Depends on rubber, tin and cocoa.  Depend on U.S. market.  Can vary v. much in price.  



N.B. 	Endorse para. 44.



		j)  Shipping.

	Para. 34.  How is U.S. shipping Bill likely to affect this?



R.S.C.	V. much.  We are trying to stop it – unlikely to succeed.

	Means 70% to be shipped in U.S. tonnage.  That won’t be available.

	They will have protected rates.  Other people’s freight rates will then fall because not enough work.  It is therefore contrary to all purposes of E.R.P.



B.	And U.S. pressure for G. ship. bldg. wd. make it worse.  And also proposal for lending 400.000 t. shipping to Germany.

	10% depressn of one freighter wd. cost $120 m.



R.S.C.	Propose due publicity – eg. in Times. In consultn with E.B.
