C.M. 15(50).				27th March, 1950.





	1.	South-East Asia:  Economic Development.



P.M.	Macdonald will go to Canberra.



E.B.	I will announce this in H/C. debate of F. Affairs to-morrow.





	2.	Bamangwato Tribe.



H.M.	Lr. fr. Cl. Davies regretting no time found for Liberal Motion &amp;

		warning tht. he wd. try to raise it on Tuesd. (F. Affairs).

		Ch. Whip is trying to arrange for Spkr. to allow 2 hrs. on Easter

		Adjournment.



P.M.	That is preferable to Tuesday.

	G.W. to be in H/C. on Tuesday, in case ……





	3.	Atlantic Pact:  Meeting of Council.



E.B.	Ques. wtr. Atlantic Council cd. be held in Ldn. in May while Acheson

		here.  Also para. 2 of Treaty – wh. we &amp; U.S. want to discuss.

		Fr. feared it wd. provoke R. if mtg. held:  but they have now

		agreed.  Mtg. will now be held.  We must prepare for it.





	4.	Council of Europe:  Germany’s Membership.



E.B.	Decided with Schuman we wdn’t run after G. over her joining

		Council of Europe.

	G. proposals – paras 1-2 OK. but para. 3 involves bargaining over

		condns.  None of original members did that.  Can’t alter

		Statute to suit new members.  Made repns to French:  trouble is

		due to their anxiety to get Saar in.  Diffies now reduced to last

		para.





	5.	Indo/Pakistan Relations.



G.W. 	V. grave situation.  India has moved most of Army to Punjab frontier

		of Pakistan.  This is known to Pakistan.  Nye has talked to

		Baj pai but recd v. unsat. answer – “moves authd months ago,

		as reply to P. war talk:  &amp; added tht. if further riots occurred no

		Indian Govt. cd. refrain fr. going in to protect Hindu minorities.

	L.A. Khan has asked us to demand India’s explann – approachg.

		Aust., Can. &amp; U.S.  We have passed on repns:  so have Austr.

		Can. thinkg. of personal message from her P.M.  U.S. is

		enquiring by letter.

	Underlines need for early appointmt of Mediator for Kashmir.

Must to-day agree with U.S. to impose a nominee of Sec. Council.

? Marshall in new circs.



P.M.	Personal message from me must be kept as last resort.

	Mediator.  Austr. Dixon best qualified.  But not a household word.



R.S.C.	Ask Truman for a big man.  Dixon, however able, will never solve

		this.



H.McN.	Support that approach.  Ask for Marshall.



E.B.	Nervous of pressing U.S. over names.  Makes it v. diff. for U.S. Govt.



R.S.C.	Lange (Norwegian)?



E.B.	A v. good choice.  Present him a from Atlantic, group not from 

		Norway (small country).



		P.M. to discuss with E.B. &amp; G.W. later to-day.





	6.	Food Prices.	[Enter  M.W. &amp; H.G.



M.W.	Concluded after review tht. butter &amp; bacon cd. best carry the increases.

		Tea wd. have bn. attractive but diffy. over o.a. pensioners.



P.M.	Butter is to go up to 5 lbs.?



M.W.	Yes.



A.B.	Does that help?  They can have more at higher prices?  Beyond reach

		of poorest classes.  Some areas where rations aren’t being taken

		up.



M.W.	Increase = 1d a wk.



R.S.C.	Avoided increasg. butter price in past because its big effect on c/living

		index.  Result, it is now v. far behind all other prices – still only

		just above pre-war price.



M.W.	No immedte prospect of any other prices coming down.



E.B.	Thinkg. of consultns with T.U.C.



R.S.C.	By 30/6 c/living figure will rise to 113.7. – won’t go above 114.



E.B.	Will it stand at 114 during winter.

R.S.C.	Can’t now see beyond 30/6.  Increases in clothing will come:  can’t

		yet say wtr. they will be balanced by other decreases.



H.W.	Cd. you increase margarine ration at same time?



M.W.	No.



E.B.	Women say you can’t use present-day margarine for cooking.

		Is that true?  Is that why it isn’t being used?



M.W.	Real reason = improvement in cooking fats, I think.  But I will

		look into it.  Increased marg. ration:  not at once, but will

		look into that too.

	I may be able to get rid of points-rationing altogether.



R.S.C.	Cd. the extra ounce be taken either in butter or in margarine.



A.B.	Reduction of food subsidies to £410 m. – will look like a sharp

		redn.  May be right v. Budget b’ground.  But I don’t know

		what’s in the Budget.



R.S.C.	Nothg. to do with Budget at all.  This is only the transln of £465 into

		appte figure for 1950/51.  T.U.C. have been told this

		figure.  Reduction due to removg. certain items e.g. animal

		feed subsidies.



H.W.	But on timing – announcement is here proposed for day after Budget.



H.M.	Date cd. now be advanced – sooner the better.



R.S.C.	No need to relate these to Budget.  No need to announce both 

		at once.



M.W.	They must be linked with farm review.  And I wd. prefer to announce

		both at once.



E.B.	Then keep it until you can announce abolition of points rationing.



A.B.	No:  abolition of points rationing won’t be popular.  For lowest

		income groups means return of rationing by purse.



M.W.	a)	Can p’pone increase in quantity of butter ration.

	b)	Can put bacon price increase on dearer cuts.



A.B.	Publicise economic price as cpd. with subsidised price.

			Agreed:    i)     Price increases approved.

			                 ii)    Timing:  M.W.  Wd. prefer to face it early

			                               next week.           Approved.

			                 iii)   Delay the increase in quantity for a time.

				[Exit  H.G. and M.W.

				[Enter  W.W.

	7.	Local Govt. Boundaries.



A.B.	This Parlt. will not be able to deal with L. Govt. Reform.  Eve’s

		proposal is ridiculous.  This puts me in a diffy. – for l.a.’s

		rightly say, if you can’t deal with genl. issue in this Parlt. &amp; we		don’t know how long it will last, particular boundary changes

		must be allowed to go fwd.  But some appns raise issues wh. wd.		prejudice major review e.g. Luton &amp; Ilford.  Others,

		e.g. Plymouth, can be allowed if changes are limited to those 

		requd for urgent purposes e.g. housing.



C.E.	Converse.  S. Shields ready to absorb Jarrow.  Latter isn’t viable &amp;

		is a trouble to Durham Co. Council.  Diff. for me if 2nd Rdg.

		discn comes on &amp; M/H. block it.  But I shall have to vote v. it,		with the Govt.

	Wrong, surely, tht. this issue shd. be p’poned into indef. future.

	Changes of popn etc., have brght. problems wh. can’t be shelved for		much longer.



A.V.A.	Can’t discuss boundaries w’out functions.



P.M.	Why must you block?  A few more changes won’t make structure

		so much worse?



R.S.C.	Why shdn’t we appoint R. Commn now?  No Govt, will be able to

		legislate w’out report of R. Commn.



P.M.	We considered earlier – thght. it futile – Govt. wd. have to settle 

		anyway – cd. do so w’out R. Commn, tho’ with a majority.



J.G.	Support A.B. re county boro’s.  But is he wise to limit admn of other		boundary changes to those needed on housing grounds.

		That wd. make patchwork worse.



A.B.	Once I go beyond housing, I don’t see where I can stand.

		Shall be pushed from one concession to another.



H.M.	Believe A.B. is right.  New co. boro. wd. wreck finances of L.C.C.

		&amp; Home Counties.  Once Ilford gets it, others round Ldn. will

		demand it.  As regards extensions, more care is needed.

	Clear we cdn’t handle genl. ques. in this Parlt. – even if we knew what

		we wanted to do, which we don’t.



H.D.	So wd. I support it – so long as room left to consider merits in some 

		good cases such e.g. as Jarrow.



P.M.	The M/H. proposal is tht. applns shd. not be considered on merits.

		Sterilising existg. pattern of l. govt.

	In last Parlt. that was justified with a view to action.  In this Parlt. it is

		proposed with a view to inaction.

	Isn’t this going too far?

	

	Cdn’t Minister  a)  block major changes viz., co. boros.  But

			        b)  give himself wider latitude on extentions, to

			             go beyond merely what is required for housing.



H.D.	A relative, rather than an absolute, stand-still.

		Genl. view:   absolute ban on co. boros.

			             for the rest reserve some discretion to allow useful

			             boundary changes to go forward.



E.Sh.	Party views.  Will be strong.  And divided.



A.B.	Para. 5 formula doesn’t bind me too tightly.



P.M.	Well, don’t go into more detail than that.





	8.	Council of Europe.



E.B.	Real aim is to get indirect legislature – putting Cttee of Ministers into

		posn of having to exercise a veto.

	H.D. tells me that opinion at Strasburg is against Paris plan.

	Only way of getting progress is by trial &amp; error, esp. closer contacts

		betwn. Assembly &amp; Cttee of Ministers.

	Cause, acc. to Gasperi, is fear tht. G. will come in and U.K. go out.

	Need also a clear decision by Executive of Labour Party.  Sovereignty

		can be qualified, but not surrendered.

	No refce to this, be it noted, in Genl. Election.



H.D.	In Strasburg 4 days last week.  People there are v. idealistic.

		Steady support for realism from Norton (Irish)!

	I support E.B.’s memo.  Need is, not for more machinery, but for

		mtgs. &amp; contacts betwn. members of Assembly &amp; Ministers.

	Party Executive (International Cttee) will be sound on this.  No diffy.

		I’m sure in getting a Party declaration, if E.B. needs it.



H.M.	Support memo.

	References to incln of Ministers in U.K. Delegn.  I myself wish that

		other countries wd. do this.  Assembly as now constituted

		v. apt to be irresponsible.  Our chaps wd. have bn. lost w’out

		Ministers’ help.



H.McN.	Don’t have too many informal mtgs.  Once commd to this, we can’t

		give it up.  Having conceded this, we shd. refuse to go on at once

		to discuss what is next concession to be made.



R.S.C.	Right v. their intervening in economic affairs.



E.B.	Must warn them tht., if they insist on this, we may have to

		withdraw.





	9.	Germany:  Coal, Iron &amp; Steel Industries.



A.B.	We left this over until G. Govt. elected.  But, as I feared, first 

		G. Govt. is Rightwing.  And they will hand these industies back

		to those who founded G. Fascism.

			Agreed:   discuss later.
