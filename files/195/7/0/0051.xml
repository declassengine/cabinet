C.M. 57(49).				26th September, 1949.



[ C.M. 55 and 56(49) were held while I was abroad on annual leave.]





	1.	Economic Situation.



	a)  Terms of Government Motion.



	Agreed:  delete “any” in last line.



P.M.	People to support …… measures.  But mainly by other Govts.

	Proposed alternative.  Broader appeal.



A.	Omit reference to external aid.



R.S.C.	Want to make it clear we aim at independence of external political.



H.W.	Add “full emplt.” among objectives.



R.S.C.	Included in measures agreed at W’ton.



H.W.	Still worth specific mention, qua presentn in domestic politics.



A.B.	Main risk is fr. Govt. supporters.  Endorse therefore H.W. proposal &amp; 

		wd. add refce to m’taining social services.



	P.M.’s alternative draft discussed in detail &amp; approved subject to

		amendment.

	Time of release of terms of Motion.

	Agreed:  copies to go to-day to Leaders of Opposn Parties &amp; copy 

		      then to be released for publication.



	b)   Chorley Report.



R.S.C.	Senior Civil Servants have repd tht. this is not moment to introduce.

	Shall see Assocns this p.m.  Tell them not 1/10/49.  But don’t propose

		to alter ultimate date of Oct. ’51. for full implementn.

		And shall arrange tht. change of date won’t affect pension rights.



	c)   Wages Policy.



R.S.C.	Summarised main points in memo.

	Profits  a)	Shall threaten compulsion if firms don’t honour agreement			to limit dividends.

		   b)	In addn, shall increase profits tax.  To help T.U.C. to put

			across wages policy.  No other way of helping them –

			tho’ will consider any they can suggest.



G.A.I.	i)   Profits.  T.U.C. can’t put policy over w’out some such gesture.

	ii)  Try hard for single tribunal for low paid workers’ claims, in

	      	spite of risk that this wd. fix a national minimum.  Less 

		dangerous than leaving this to a no. of diff. bodies.

	Haven’t considered composn – pending T.U.C. views.



P.M.	Are they to decide by majority?  If so, all depends on independent

		members.  And what criterion are they to take?  Is Govt. to

		indicate criterion.  Needs more thought.



G.A.I.	Agree.  But better than leaving it to numerous bodies.

	Favour composn similar to that of Nat. Arbn Tribunal.



R.S.C.	Alternatives –

		i)	Govt. to fix minimum wage.

		ii)	Agreemt. to refer to new tribunal all “low wage” claims.

		iii)	      ..        tht. in refces to existg. tribunals T.U.’s won’t bring

			      fwd. any claim save one based on view tht. wage isn’t

			      a decent living wage.

	Favour ii) as long-term aim of a single central Tribunal for all wage

		claims.  Doubt if T.U.C. will take it.  But try it on.  And fall back,

		if we must, on iii).



A.W.          	i)	Agric. Wages Bd. – indep. members have taken line of splitting 		the difference.  Union will put in a claim.  Will this policy stop 		it?

                   	ii)	Cotton.  Wage increases achieved with lower prices.  Is that to be 

		stopped?



R.S.C.	No exception for ii).

	On i), some change in system some day.  But can’t do it now.



A.B.	On ii) – no reason to stop new system of wage structure e.g. in Lancs.

		Wdn’t prevent piece rates or earnings being increased.

a)	This ques. wd. have had to be tackled anyway, w’out

		devaluation.		 

		Gives us a chance to insert new machinery of permanent value.

		Must get it across to workers tht. wage increases irrelevant to 

		increased prodn are useless to them.  If this is right, why relate

		it to 9 months or any other period?  That will be taken as promise

		of increase at end of 9 months.  Wd prefer to have it reviewed at

		3 month intervals.



G.A.I.	Or 6 months.



A.B.           	b)	Must introduce conceptn of national minimum.  Tho’ Govt. 			shdn’t fix it.  Every industry has its lowest-paid workers:  but 		they may be lower than middle range in other industries.



R.S.C.	cf. para. 12 of memo.



A.B.	I agree, save for 9 months:  but want to press the point.

                   	c)	More definite about profits tax.  Has R.S.C. got a figure?

		Also cd. he go further?  Price increase in bread – appears to be		against our policy of putting burden on strongest shoulders.  Cd.		there not be increase in family allowances?



R.S.C.	Discussed.  M/L. strongly opposed.



G.A.I.	Wdn’t do the trick.  O.a. pensioners &amp; fixed income people wdn’t get

		benefit.  Also mistake to relate social services rates too directly

		to prices.



J.G.	This plan works twds. nat. minimum wage.

	Cd a T.U. ask for such a minimum in its industry?



R.S.C.	This tribunal wd. deal with low-paid claims only.



J.G.	Existg. tribunals deal with that now.  T. of r. wd. have to be adjusted.

	If this is done, &amp; increases are awarded on basis of giving a decent

		living standard, how can we resist claims to increase levels of

		social service rates.



R.S.C.	Agree there wd. be pressure.  A minimum wage of £5 wd. cost 

		£200 m. in social service rates.



G.A.I.	Escalator agreements.  46 – covering 18 industies &amp; 1½ m. workers, of

		whom 1 m. are in bldg.  That moves annually on annual average.

		Move wd. be in Feb. ’50.  Important to get agreement to 

		standstill for that.



H.M.	Is assistance a wage?  Not so intended.  We shd. have to face that.

		Shd. have to resist any suggn that minimum wage shd. be 

		taken as proper level for assistance.

	Rates and earnings.  Tribunal shd. take a/c. of earnings, not only

		rates, for lower-paid workers.

	Agriculture.  Most workers earn above minimum:  also he lives

		more cheaply.

	Must therefore preserve some flexibility.

	Bread.  M/F. shd. give Govt. spokesmen the facts.  Mayn’t be as bad as

		it sounds.

	T.U.C. shd. be pressed into early agreement.  Mustn’t miss tide.

	Cab. shd. have a report on publicity needed to drive home lessons

		of devaluation.  T.U. officials are servants of rank and file;

		&amp; its latter who must be won over.

	What do you do on wages in debate?



R.S.C.	Give general picture &amp; announce increase in profits tax.



A.V.A.	Tribunal.  Displacing existg. machinery may cause widespread strikes.



A.B.	Legn for that purpose wd. be impossible.



A.V.A.	Profits tax.  Don’t like idea of justifying this as set-off.

		Policy will need much energy &amp; drive by industry.

		Will this be called forth by increasg. tax – esp. if T.U.’s don’t

		play on their side over wages.



A.	Increased exports to dollar areas necessary, if benefit of devaln is to

		be secured.  You must therefore get new people active in these

		markets.

		Will they be encouraged by increased profit tax?



R.S.C.	New value of dollar will be the inducement.  Profits tax only 

		decreases inducement to some extent.



G.T.	Discn proceeded so far on basis of producers.  What of others?

		Teachers are pressing for wage increases.  Their appln goes to

		l.a.’s, who employ large nos. of others.

	We are nearing end of a revolution in idea of relative value of work.

		Chorley decision helps.  But doesn’t get over main difficulty.

	Must have a definite ruling tht. this policy applies to administrative

		salaries as well as productive wages.  They too shd. go to same

		tribunal.



J.G.	T.U.C. opposed to linking soc. services &amp; wages.  But shd. we not ask

		them what men wd. think about adding 1/= to family allowances,

		at cost of £10-12 m.  Wage increases wd. be much more costly.



H.W.	Support increase in family allowances.  And T.U.C. shdn’t be final

		judges of this.



P.M.	Bad psychology.  Throwing a sop.  cf. 1d off beer – which spoiled

		austere Budget.



J.S.	Different, however, if we linked it with profits tax.

	Increase in food prices bears more hardly on poor than rich.  Argue

		therefore that, in pursuance of income re-distn policy, we are

		increasing profits tax &amp; using the money to increase children’s

		allowances.



A.W.	Wd support that if we took firmer line on wages.

	Low-paid exceptn is a v. dangerous loop-hole.

			Agreed:   { Put to T.U.C. alternatives re Tribunal

			                { Drop the 9 months’ period, unless T.U.C. 

			                        suggest.

			                 Profits tax:  Govt. decision:  not to be put to 

			                        T.U.C. as a quid pro quo.

			                 Children’s allowances:  Abandon idea of

			                        increasing them unless T.U.C. say that this

			                        wd. enable them to hold wages position.

	d)   Anglo-Canadian Trade.



A.B.	Cd we have a memo. on ques. how W’ton decns affect ques. of Canada

		holding sterling.



R.S.C.	E.B. will raise in Ottawa ques. of wheat price.  that is best way of 

		working into this.





	2.	Radio-Olympia Exhibition.



H.M.	Supposed to open this on Wedy.

	There is unofficial strike on.  Shd. I go?



G.A.I.	Yes.  Painters &amp; woodworkers only – not electricians etc.

	If the exhibition isn’t ready, we cd. say that it’s due to unhelpful

		unofficial action.
