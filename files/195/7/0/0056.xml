C.M. 62 (49)					27th October, 1949



1.	     Parliament.

				[Enter W.W.

H.M.	Business for next week.



A.	Don’t want Parlt. Bill before 11/11.  



H.M.	Watchg. that.



A.	J &amp; P due in H/C. by 11/11.  Thro’ Cttee in H/Lords.



H.M.	Ques. wtr. we shall be able to get it thro’ before end/Session.



A.	Trying to smother cock-fighting Bill (passed by Commons by oversight).





2.	     Greece:  Withdrawal of forces.



E.B.	Don’t believe civil war will break out again.  Gk. Army organised.

	Suitable time to w’draw our troops.

	Will notify U.S. &amp; Comm. Govts. and then Gk. Govt.

	Sent prelim. warning to U.S. Govt. saying not decided, &amp; it leaked in W’ton as connd with our economies.  Also leaked in Ldn. thro’ United Press.

	Mission is Joint Anglo-American.  Shall have to discuss thro’ J.S.M. W’ton.   Not broached yet with U.S.



A.V.A.	We have no strong views on size of Mission.  Grks. mayn’t be able to pay for so large a Mission as U.S. want.



			Agreed.





3.	     Memorial Service for J.R. Clynes.



P.M.   x/.	Custom for Mem. Service to be arranged by Dpt. to wh. ex-Minister belonged.

	Do H.O. intend one for Clynes?



C.E.	H.O. don’t recognise x/ as precedent.



P.M.	Sc. Off. did it for W’wood.  W.O. for Mottistone.



C.E.	Will make further enquiries.



E.B.	Wd. T.U. do it?



A.V.A.	He was R.C.  Where wd. you hold it?

			General view:  there shd. be a Service.  Cd. T.U. do it?  

			                         Cd. Party do it.  Ch. Whip to explore.

			                         ? T.U.C. and Labour Party.



				[Enter G.S.

4.	      Iron &amp; Steel Bill.



G.S.	If passed under Parlt Act

B.	No electn before Feb.

C.	Risk of diffies in App.

	May 1st is now quite impossible.  Shall soon have to admit it.

		Shd. we not therefore be realistic &amp; delete date.  Misleading also to leave it in.

	If we delete H/L. wd. prob. have to accept Bill.

	Recognise pol. diffies, but on balance favour realistic course.



P.M.	Why quarrel with H/L. by insistg. on date you must admit to be impossible.



A.	Favour realistic course.

	But if you delete date fr. Bill, it’s open:  any date w’in 18 mos. fr. R. Assent.

	They might insist on another date so as to ensure not before election.



H.D.	If we meet them on date, will they pass Bill?



A.	No reason to think they wdn’t.



A.B.	Argument is not re date but re another mandate fr. electorate.

	V. serious for us to admit need for double mandate.

	Why is May 1st impossible?  Made impossible by resistance of H/L.

		Must stick to our guns – to enable us to lose the Bill &amp; say H/L. are responsible for its loss.



R.S.C.	Sessions contemplated in App. are impossible fr. pt. of view of Budget &amp; Finance business.



E.B.	Agreed to 1/5 previously, as point of principle, with eyes open.

		If Steel Bill passed this session, Parlt. Bill won’t be necessary.

	We shall be made to look foolish either way.



H.D.	Bill says “May 1st or such later date….



E.B.	Agree:  why go back on that?



J.	Cd. you get 1/5 amended if Bill not going thro’ before?

		Spkr. ought to certify such an amendment.  But can’t be sure he would.

	You are out of field of certainty.  I wd. prefer, on legal grounds, to compromise &amp; get H/L. to pass it.

H.M.	I think Spkr. shd. allow an amendment.  Can’t be sure he would.

	V. diff. politically to monkey with 1950 Session.

	And P.M.’s discretion re date of election may be jeopardised.

	I wd. prefer to be realistic.  1st May is impossible.  This will be an issue at election.

	Will simplify 1950 Session if this Bill passed earlier.



R.S.C.	I wd. prefer to stand put unless by doing so we create Parly diffies in 1950 Session.  I wd. rather not give in to H/Lords.



A.B.	Cd. we have an ad hoc Cttee under L.P. to consider

	a) implications

b) presentn – if we do decide to compromise with H/L.



			Agreed:  P.M. to arrange small Cttee to review the posn.



						[Exit G.S.

					          [Enter Jebb.

5.	     Council of Europe.



E.B.	Must consider this in reln to O.E.E.C., Commonwealth, &amp; our posn as 1st Class World Power.  Some U.S. tendency to consider us as merely European power.

		Our geogr., Comm., &amp; world posn makes inevitable some tight-rope walking over this.

	Opposed to special session.  Due mainly to U.S.C. agitn re Germany.

	Procedure.  Council of Ministers, representg. Govts., can’t be regarded as reporting to or answerable to Assembly, which consists of individuals not representg. Govts.

	O.E.E.C.:  must not be jeopardised until 1952.

	Germany:  Propose we indicate to Adenauer that if they apply for admission as associate member appln will be sympathetically received.

		France, however, want Saar admitted as associate member.  France hasn’t absorbed it as Department of France.  Ques. of principle is involved.  We accepted associate status as interim arrangemt. pending full independence.  Diff. therefore to accept Saar unless France willing to admit they may eventually become independent.

	Austria.  Some wd. like immedte admn.  But Treaty may be thro’ by end of year.  Don’t want to set that back.  Might offend R. by admittg. her to C/Europe.  Opinion on this in Austria is divided.  Some, tho; urging w’drawal of all troops, don’t want ours to go.  I’ve made clear my firm intn thr. B. troops shall go.

	My concln: get Treaty, w’drawal of troops by specified date, &amp; at once after that date admit A. to C/Europe.



R.S.C.		i) Careful to avoid giving impn tht. we are ready to go further than we are in economic co-opn in Europe.  Shd. we not also consider makg. that publicly clear.

		ii) Econ-resoln of Assembly.  3 courses.  I favour the second viz, refce to Govts., who might be expected to have it considered by O.E.E.C.



H.M.	Agree re Germany.

	Saar.  V. unrealistic to contemplate eventual independence.  Farcical to bring them in as associate member, tho’ I see French difficulties.



H.W.	Tories are trying to pretend Comm. preferences can be linked with W. European economic co-opn.  Wd. be helpful if other Comm. Govts. cd. declare r. that.



H.D.	No need to take that seriously.

	Veto on accessions.  What they were afraid of was Spain – not Germany.

		Safe in turng. this down, if it’s not in fact intended to add Spain.

	Believe Fr. will accept Germany, so long as it isn’t over-publicised.

		Let them have Saar if it will ease Fr. agreemt. to Germany’s admissn. Saar might be politically independent, tho’ remaing. in Customs Union with France.



R.S.C.	Dangerous precedent.  Not separate sovereignty.  Might be followed by Morocco, or even Wales.



H.D.	Human Rights Convn.  Don’t mind so long as emphasis is on “in principle.”  There is a lot of nonsense in it:  &amp; some danger (e.g. incln of protn for property rights &amp; religion).



A.B.	V. blurred picture – inevitably.

	Support E.B.’s view on Austria.

	Looks as tho’ Europ. Govts. haven’t enough domestic authority to settle own conflicts.  Trying to get some authy. fr. outside to support them.

		Ought we not therefore to encourage maximum Europn co-opn.  For we are in a dangerous posn.  Italy:  Commn is by no means to be ignored.  Tito-ism might be introduced into Comm. Party in Italy, just to confuse it.

		R. bound to try to make trouble in W. Germany.  She must get hold of Ruhr if she is to satisfy economic needs of countries she controls.

	Thus, tho’ we shd. remain practical, we shd. not be slow to encourage maximum econ. integn of Europe – to stem Comm. tide.

	Don’t be too cold.



P.M.	No:  but we mustn’t allow ourselves to get too deeply commd in Europe – economically &amp; politically.  For they wd. rely too much on us.  And we can’t carry them – as well as our world responsibilities.



E.B.	We ourselves shall be drawn rather to an Atlantic Fedn than to a European Fedn.  Our main task is to attach Canada to U.K. rather than run after Europe.  Let Europe federate on its own.



G.T.	Cultural &amp; scientific recommns.  Take care to avoid duplicating these bodies.  Quite enough already.



			Memo approved.	

					[Exit W.W., H.M.



6.	      Economic Unification of Europe.



E.B.	1-4:  basic:  must be declared to Parlt. &amp; the world.

	U.S. are running two horses.

	Must say where we stand.



A.B.	Transfer of Italians to France.  Any progress?  There wd. be gt. easement to both sides if 7 m. could be transferred.

	Vital to ease pressure on Italy for it wd. reduce Comm. pressures in N. Italy.



R.S.C.	Italian Chairman of Cttee cd. bring it to Assembly if Fr. delay is unreasonable.



E.B.	Our source of labour for African developmt. is Italy.  We aren’t doing enough on that.  Shd. like a Cttee (4th point) on African developmt., with an Italian on it.

	Must find a way of giving Italian workman his chance.  A good settler.  And send the money home to breed in lire.

	Can’t C.O. give more help over this?



R.S.C.	 Only way to do it is by steering Col. developmt. into O.E.E.C.



E.B.	Will discuss that possibility with R.S.C.  Satisfd I can’t get this moving thro’ Govts.



C.J.	Opposn to Italians by public opinion in Africa – thanks largely to success of our war propaganda.

	Pity we took Ital. P.O.W.’s out of E. Africa, where they were doing good work as employees.

	Surveys in hand.  Work may start soon. Shall try to use Italians as far as I can.



A.V.A.	Para. 8.  In earlier E.P.C. discns referred to war dangers of integrn. of certain indies  Gather this isn’t now so dangerous.

	Wd. like to add 5)  Likely to prejudice security or war potential of U.K.



R.S.C. 	W.O. wd. bring anything under than formula.



H.D.	No real danger.

	Agree with these reservations.



R.S.C.	After conferences, we might have to make some public decln.

	Hoffman’s visit.  He will make some declaration, in Paris, on basis no more Aid if so-and-so isn’t done.  That might involve askg. us to do things here indicated as imposs.  I might have to say so, tho’ I don’t want to do it precipitately.



A.	This shd. be re-assurg. to some Comm. Countries.



    record \	Para. 11 of App. B.  Shd. like to keep them fully informed.  Wd. like to 

          this\ 		talk to High Comms.



R.S.C.	Want some sort of statement in H/C. by E.B., sometime.



A.V.A.	Don’t want my point brushed aside.

	Europe is dangerous.

	On security, there shd. be proper consultn with Defence Dpts.



A.B.	Deprecate general debate or statement in H/C.  Must keep it specific.



					[Exit Jebb.

					[Enter Solr. Genl.



7.	     Recognition of Chinese Communist Government.



E.B.	Evatt’s statement.  After pressing us for weeks to recognise this Govt., he has now said tht. in absence of specific assurances tht. territ. integrity of neighbouring countries incldg. Hong-Kong will be respected &amp; thr. internl. obligns will be accepted, recognn can’t be granted any more than cd. admn to U.N.  Said, too, tht. this is view of U.S. &amp; U.K.

	I was v. anxious not to raise this.  We declared it wd. be aggression.

		Didn’t ask them to agree.  But believe they accept it:  they haven’t denied it.

	Evatt’s line is egregious folly.



R.S.C.	Consider issuing statement makg. it clear tht. this isn’t U.K. policy.



E.B.	Yes:  will prob. say E’s statement, if correctly reported, goes far beyond anything in H.M.G.’s statement of…..

	No precedent for conditional recognn.



Solr. G.	There cdn’t be a conditional de iure recognn.  De facto recogn is a kind of condnl recognn.



E.B.	U.S. attitude beginning to turn.  Never bn. able to discuss China with U.S.  They always regard it as their own affair.  I declined to sign the China report at Moscow mtg.

	If I consult U.S. &amp; other Powers …  don’t want to hurry it … might be poss. to do somethg. wh. won’t intensify E/West antagonism.

	Want to keep Asiatic countries in step with Western.

	Para. 17 (i) – (3) – if approved – will give me this chance.



A.	Considering how to handle Doms. – especially after Evatt.

       ||	Early discn with High Comms. in Ldn.

       ||	Only Dom. likely to query it wd. be Canada: &amp; that not v. serious.



C.J.	a)  Don’t drag in refces to H.K. in the recognn.  Wd. stir up unnecessary discussions.

	b)  Pol. problem in Malaya followg. recognn.  How to put it over to Chinese. Must try to dissociate banditry &amp; Commn in Malaya from our recognn of Comm. Govt. in China.



R.S.C.	U.S. Ty. are pressing re recognn.  For Chinese repve acts a part of their bloc on International Bank.

				[Exit Solr. Genl.



8.	     South East Asia &amp; Far East.



E.B.	This is a policy.



R.S.C.	Raises large economic issue – paras. 8-10.  Contrary to dirn in wh. we are movg. to sterling balances.

	We shd. mislead if we suggested we are ready to do much by way of unrequited exports to that area.  We shall be able to do v. little.

		Hope we may do somethg. for Burma.  But pretence tht. we will fight cold war in S.E.A. by large-scale assistance in econ-developmt. wd. be most misleadg.

	At confce we must say we shall do less in next 50 yrs. than we have done in last 4 yrs.



E.B.	Much is investment for dollar-earning.

	Don’t swing too far.

	Paras 8-10 don’t commit us to much.

	If you don’t have investment e.g. in Siam, must we hand it to U.S.A.

	Surely we must study implicns.



R.S.C.	F/E. Cttee are studying it.  And aren’t agreed.  M’while don’t create impn we can do more in S.E.A. than we have done.

		Remember India is part of it.  In last 2 yrs. it was mainly in I., P. Burma &amp; Ceylon:  £200 m. p.a.  Shall have to cut to 50% or 25% of that.



A.	This is one place in world where we can dollars in return for our investment.

	Voice of Britain radio station at Singapore.  Delayed.  R. are now getting ahead of us.



A.B.	This memo. is pivotal.  World so disturbed tht. it can’t attract private capital investmt.  We can’t retain political control over these areas &amp; accept responsibility for industrialisg. them. U.S. must do the second.

	Also scale of enterprise is too large now for private investors.

	We shd. raise this ques. at highest level.

	We alone, even as Govt. can do no more than stutter over this.



R.S.C.	We put this in W’ton.

	On sterling balances, we said we can’t go on:  but someone else must provide the capital goods if Comm encroachmt. is to be stemmed.

	U.S. have at last begun to realise it.

	Back to original point.

		This must be linked with M/E. &amp; African proposals.

		We’ve said we shall cut down.  We must.  We must get out a p’mme in consultn with W’ton.   And in wh. we must avoid commitment.



E.B.            x/	V. well:  will instruct Dening accordingly.

	My policy is to retain political control in these countries &amp; make U.S. pay for it.  I think they will.



R.S.C.	Content subject to x/.

	Want to get p’mme worked out.



E.B.	Want continuing body W’ton to get crackg. &amp; aim at mtg. with Acheson &amp; Pearson in New Year in Ldn.





9.	     Private Claims against Foreign Countries.



R.S.C.	Short point – Can we now deal with German money this Session?

	There is £15 m. of assets under Custodian’s control.

	We cd. seize them as repns.  Or we cd. use them to set off v. specific debts to nationals. Or can allow distn amongst creditors.

	We asked in Jan. tht. claims shd. be put in &amp; told H/C. we wd. announce what we intend to do.  Parly need therefore for early statement.

	Decided to follow precedent of Versailles.

	As in memo.



H.W.	Easier to take the money into Exchequer.  Shall have to do this.

		But staff of 100, rising to 200, will be needed.

		Cost won’t fall on Exchequer.
