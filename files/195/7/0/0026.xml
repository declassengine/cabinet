C.M. 30(49)							28th April 1949



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter W.W.



H.M. 	Business for next week.



	Statement on India.  Expld intentns to use – mere mention in Statement on Business – because didn’t want substantive debate until other P.M.’s had got back.

	Queries about amendmt of S/W.

	W.S.C. suggd communiqué be read to H/C. for the record.  P.M. has agreed to this.

	Whips to damp down our side.



J.	L.O.’s shd. be consulted on legn. point.	[Enter E.Sh., Henderson, 						 Att.G



		2.	War Crimes : German Generals.



E.Sh.	As in memo.

	Since, J. and Att. G. have suggd there is a possibility of bringing them before a court under a section of Army Act.

	Tired of this ques.  Want a decision – final, one way or another.  Think Govt. not court, shd. take responsibility for deciding wthr. or not to bring them to trial.



J.	If a  ct. martial, no doubt it wd. not have bn. competent to convene a ct.

	For convening offr. must have statement tht. he is fit for trial.

	Civil charge in U.K.  Before indictmt. not put on trial.  After indictmt. it is for Att. Genl. to issue nolle prosequi. 

	But King’s Regs. aren’t applicable in law to War Crimes Trial.  It is open therefore to offr. to convene ct.  And if told we thought it desirable he might exercise his discretion in favour of convening ct.

	Court cdn’t decide fitness.  Wd. have to refer that back to convening officer with its findings on fitness.

	That is to say G.O.C. Germany will have to decide.  V. awkward.

								             [Exit T.W.

	circs because R.’s adviser will prob advise that he is fit.

	Necessary to prepare full indictment.  We shd. look v. foolish.



H.M.	Wd. Att. G. issue nolle prosequi in murder case in U.K.?



Att.G.	I think so.  But M.O. hospital now says they are fit.

	Think a court cd. determine issue.

	But believe it expedient tht. Govt. shd. take decision and publish medical evce.

	I wd. suppress view of hospital M.O.



A.B.	Let the court decide betwn. conflictg. medical evce.

	That report won’t stand up to criticism.  Same things cd. be said about any man over 60.



E.B.	Suspect whole thing has bn. faked.  N.c.o.’s and men under their orders have bn. hanged.  Every attempt made to delay trials of Genls.

	How can I stand up to this internationally.  No one will believe we wanted to put these men on trial.  Think what comments will be made v. me if another 4 Power mtg. is held.



J.	Read Hospital M.O.’s report.



E.Sh.	Wrong to put responsibility for decn on B. officers.



R.S.C.	Let doctors be x-examined and bring out the real truth.



E.B.	Is it not possible to appoint someone to advise Govt. – eg. eminent Judge after x-examining the doctors.  Let Govt. decide – don’t want to shovel responsibility off on to senior officers.  But let us have clear advice.



A.B.	Can’t we have doctor from each of 3 Powers + Judge.



E.B.	Must do it in B. Zone or hand them over to claimant countries.

	Can’t easily have 3 Powers in, wd. have to have 4.

	Have missed chance of getting this over to U.S. to try.



J.	No diffy. in putting case privately to one or more Judges.

	But decn will involve public criticism.

	Cdn’t therefore allow it made public what Judges had advised.



H.M.	Med. story isn’t too good.

	Public criticism if we let them off.  If we can plead Judges’ opinion in public, will it be much use.

	My inclination is to decide now to put them on trial, w’out raising unfitness.



C.E.	It is for defence, normally, to raise unfitness.



J.	I wd. not be a party to with-holding that from court.



A.B.	V. heavy weather.



	We have to justify long delay.  For that purpose, say conflict of med. evce and publish it.  Let court decide on that wthr. these men are fit.



J.	I am ready to hear medical evidence – under x-examination – and report to Cabinet.



R.S.C.         x/	Made same suggn.



J. 	Myself with both L.O.’s Prs. with a medical assessor.

							                       [Exit A.B.

E.B.	Ques. in H/L. on Thursday.  



J. 	P’pone for a week, if Simon agrees.



H.	Already p’poned twice.



J.	Try to get it done early next week – for Cab. decision next Thursday.



			Agree as at x/.



E.B.	Genl. memo. on ?  Germans War Crimes. for Cab. next week.



							[Exit H.

							[Enter Listowel.

		3.	Reinforcement of Hong Kong.



E.Sh.	Reported Def. Cttee conclusions and recommendations.

	Terms of announcement.

	Danger of sending raw troops. eg. Malaya last year.

	Announcement : Thought Ministers of Def. Cttee were uneasy v. second part.  Prefer to end at “internal security”.



E.B.	No refce to Comm. agression shd. be made – provocative. Don’t worsen posn of B. consuls and others in Comm. held parts of China.

	Also, our troubles may come from Koumintang.

	Our line shd. be : B. posn resp. for law and order, re-inforcing because of dangers of surrounding situation.



L.	“To protect H.K. from any dangers arising fr. present situation in China” is suggd by Gov. H.K.



R.S.C.	Protn v. influx of refugees.  Why not put it on that basis.



E.B.	Cd. F.O., C.O. and W.O. together settle the wording. E.B. initiative. Agreed.



C.E.	Will this re-inforcement be enough?  Or will it be Singapore all over again?

	Small body as demonstration inadequate for action?



E.B.	Went into that at Def. Cttee.

	Assured H.K. cd. be defended save v. attack by 1st class Power.

	Def  Cttee decided this re-inforcement wd. be for purposes stated. But C.O.S. to keep in touch weekly with M/D. and 3 Ministers and keep Cab. advised so tht. we shd. not be caught. If major attack is likely to develop, posn will have to be reviewed.



R.S.C.	Anxious v. C.O.S. view tht. Comm. China is not to be          [Exit H.W.

	regarded as 1st class power.  Agree they prob won’t attack H.K.

	But if they turned hostile, we shd. have to look at it as a major danger – esp. because Comm. 5th column infiltration in H.K. itself.



A.W.	Cab. will also have to consider wthr. (politically) we shall insist on holdg. H. Kong against an unwilling Comm. China.  We shd. have a policy in advance – political as well as military ques.  Esp. if sabotage of water supply alone wd. make it untenable.



N.B.	Inform Comm. Govts. 



E.B. 	Agreed at Def. Cttee y’day.



E.B.	Beware of careless talk v. impossibility of holding H. Kong.  Don’t create atmosphere of scuttle in advance.  Face it here : but don’t spread alarm outside.



		Re-inforcement approved.

		Announcement as above.

		Defer final despatch of rest of brigade group pending

		C.O.S. appreciation.



R.S.C.	Announce (casually) in course of debate on China on 4/5.

	Generally agreed. Unless sitn makes earlier announcement inevitable.
