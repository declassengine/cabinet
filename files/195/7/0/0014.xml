C.M. 14(49)							22nd February 1949



		1.	Atlantic Pact.



E.B.	Article 5 : obligations : Memo. as at date of circulation.

	Since then a new U.S. draft, set out in Telegram.

	If we indicate support Acheson will put this to Senate Cttee.

	Have bn. anxious to avoid implication of U.S. coming to others’ aid – preferred conception of mutual support in “Atlantic community”.

	(St. Laurent’s phrase).  Must get it across (against E.R.P. and similar conceptns) that Europe is capable of asking a contribution to America’s security.



	First change = improvemt. on previous drafts.

	Second  “    = weakening because it leaves it to each to decide what is necessary.



	But gt. deal of feeling tht. some discretion shd. be left with parties.



	Like E.R.P. can make no headway with Adminn alone until Senate has given authy. wh. enables Adminn. to take action which it can claim to be consequential upon Congress authority.



	“Its own constitutional processes.”  This might now go in as a new Art. ll.  Each country shall carry out obligns above in acc …….

	Canada objecting to Art. 2.  They think this more than a military pact. We are supportg. them on this.



	Other countries’ participn. Italy : wd. be diff. to adapt for them.

	Norway etc. Ques therefore a) wait and adapt to get all in  b) go ahead with Brussels Powers and let others “adhere” later.  I favour (b).

	Discussed with Turkish F. Minister.  Turkey has Treaty with us and assistance fr. U.S.  If you had to get eg. Norway to agree to it Turkey might get less.  T. ready to assist with M/E.?  Leave them in status quo pro-tem.  I prefer this to any genl. Declaration.



	Authority needed	a) to consult Brussels Powers on Art. 5.

				b) give views to U.S. and let it go to Congress.

				c) final decn. by Cabinet when all is ready – no 			    commitment m’while.



P.M.	Support form of new Art. 5.



H.D.	Great improvement on last; and better than most earlier versions.



N.B.	Canada has protested v. what U.S. lately proposed.	          [Enter H.M.

	Prs. have stiffened Washington.

	

	Agreed:  support latest draft of Article 5.



	New Article ll.



A.B.	Obvious, but is it necessary?



	Agreed:  Do it in separate Article if U.S. really want it, but do avoid it 	   if it isn’t necessary.



	Social and economic purposes.



P.M.	Rather unnecessary : but support Can. demand for it if we must.



	Other Powers.



P.M.	a)  Prefer to go ahead with Brussels Powers and let others “adhere” 	later.	Agreed.



	b)  Declaration is very weak.  Will look feeble.  Avoid it, if 	possible.	Agreed.
