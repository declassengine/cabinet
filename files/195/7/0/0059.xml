C.M. 66(49).				14th November, 1949.



	1.	Egypt:  Tankers:  Iraq – Pipe-line.



E.B.	Iraq &amp; Eg. won’t agree to act at once.

	Can’t use force.

	Elections in E.  Can’t act until they are over.

	Proposed stoppage of pipe line to Tripoli via Syria is even more 

		serious.

		Fr. are v. upset because Anglo-Iranian proposg. to delay for

		12 months.

		Prs. because they fear a surplus of oil.

		If that line were there Iraq cdn’t hold oil up.



P.M.	Said Nuri Pasha is holdg. up v. it.  Can’t we press him?



R.S.C.	We are doing – on finance.  And he is saying now he’s leaving 

		sterling area.



H.D.	Why have E. physical powers over Canal.  Cdn’t Co. pass tanker thro’.



E.B.	No:  Eg. cd. &amp; wd. stop it.  They have powers (in a state of war) under

		Defence Agreemt. – as I found when hostilities going on in 

		Palestine.

	I have cleared their obstn over merchant ships.

	Now trouble over oil because tankers never went thro’ &amp; we only want

		them to go thro’ because Nuri is blockg. oil thro’ pipe line.  This

		makes it a hostile act to Nuri &amp; Eg. Govt. won’t do it.

	Jews also being difficult.



R.S.C.	Cd. U.S. help in bringing pressure on Iraq?

	Or save their face with a mixed cargo – only a bit going to Haifa.



E.B.	Or let it thro’ &amp; protest afterwards.



H.D.	Loss of dollar oil.



A.V.A.	Haifa buying fr. Venizuela.





	2.	Wages Policy.                                       [Enter  H.G., B., J.G., G.S.



R.S.C.	T.U.C. passed some resolns wh. are hopeful.  They have tackled 

		standstill &amp; sliding-scale.  They have asked for restraint &amp; said if

		it’s forthcomg. sliding-scale Unions will see what they can do.

	Ministers talked on Saty.  E.B. was to reflect.



E.B.	Problem:  reconcile slid. scale (only 2 m) &amp; the rest.

		Diffy.:  if wages were all level (112) at pt. of negn you cd. fix

		a standstill figure.  But rlways. at 106, others 109, 110 etc.

		And a stop figure might mean increases to come up to it in

		some cases.  This = sl. scale cases &amp; c/living figures.

	Coal = 2 rises at 103:  agric. at 109:  cotton at 111:  wool 111

		chemicals &amp; road haulage 111.  These are latest increase

		dates.  C/living now is 112.

	Our view on Sat. was to stop at 113-118.  Let all slid. scale Unions 

		go up to 113 &amp; stay there.  Equally no loss of wages for 5 or 6

		point drop below 113.

	Diffy = apply this idea to engineering etc., who have 4 points to go up

		&amp; wd. get a biggish rise.

	Considered therefore proposal to suspend for a period &amp; let them raise

		figures.  For non sl. scale Unions won’t raise figures if we don’t.

	Period:  try for Feb. ’51.  Short of Budget for 51/52 – but give U.S.

		chance to work out their buying scheme.

	Can’t have freeze over piece-rates where changes in prodn – e.g. new

		machinery at Bolsover.

	Must also talk incentives – in Industrial councils – where no

		piece-rates.

	Don’t want to be too specific at this p.m.’s talk with T.U.C.

	Low-paid workers.  Think we must drop that.  Doubt if T.U.C. want

		to press it.  Done 18 mos. ago at issue of W. Paper.  Indies then

		low-paid have all come up.  Aug. ’49 1½ m. in distn &amp; clothg.

		had minimum raised.  That argument has now gone.

		Lincoln Evans alarmed because wdn’t be able to get men to 

		accept promn if differential narrowed much more.  Used to be

		£1 p. wk.  Now nearing 16/= - not enough to warrant learng.

		trade.

	Prefer to go now for stabilisation (temporary) incldg. differentials as

		now.



G.A.I.	Support 112 as basic line.  Sl. scale works both ways:  these trades

		have had one decrease.

	Hosiery have recd 22/6 on b.s.  Bldg. only 3/8.  Because 1st move

		monthly &amp; second annually.  Bldg. review due Feb., can we

		deprive them of what they were due to get for last 12 mos. rise?

	Even if rlways (last rise at 106) ask to come up to 112, it might be

		cheaper than allowg. open negotn on claim.  E.g. engineers

		have asked for £1 p. wk.  I therefore wd. prefer to let the 

		laggards come up to 112.



R.S.C.	That wd. mean re-settlement of every wage rate.



G.A.I.	But you wd. have got all wages related to c/living.

	Afraid of E.T.H.



E.B.	I don’t want to mention 112.  Prefer to say:  no movement until

		c/l reaches x.   And leave anomalies as now.  Frightened of

		bringing all up to 112.



A.W.	Agree.  No increase for bldg. save for incentive.  They are disgrace.

	Believe workers wd. accept.  Call Comm. bluff.  Stand up to it.



B.	Shd have to face 6% on rlways.



E.B.	Only if you raised all to 112 level.



B.	V. serious if it happened.  But see force of argument tht. we can’t

		plug “low-paid worker” any longer.

		Can’t get men to accept promn.



G.S.	Steel workers because history of wage scale wd. strongly resist any 

		deprivn of the increase due on sl. sc. agreemt.

	Engineering wages are high.  They wd. accept stabilisation.  Ready

		to co-operate with govt., whatever Unions say.

	Low-paid.  More trouble by raising than not because resentment of

		skilled men.



H.G.	Miners claim based on c/living outstandg.  N.C.B. dispute this.

	Support E.B.’s 2nd thoughts.  Raise to 112 &amp; you wd. concede 

		miners’ case.



R.S.C.	Bowman hopes to get claim w’drawn.



H.G.	Low-paid.  Right remedy is in incentive schemes.  Bonus scheme from

		face to pit-head.



G.T.	Support E.B.

	When a Union gets flat rate increase, c/living link shd. be abandoned.

		Can’t have it both ways.  For c/living link was based on a low

		basic rate.



J.G.	Support E.B.’s 2nd thghts.

	9½ m:  About 8 m. on T.U. agreemts. as cpd. with 1½ m. on sl. scale.

	Must therefore keep off the 112.  That wd. cause large increase in

		wages (T.U.).

	Low paid.  Try to extend piece-rate system.  E.g. collective bonus

		related to output of pit as a whole.



R.S.C.	Had such schemes under M.A.P.  They can be done.

	Standstill on time factor or c/living factor.

		More chance on “until c/living reaches x” than on “2 years”.

	But diffy because sl. scale reviews are held at diff. intervals.  Diff.

		to deprive people who are just about to get a rise.  Can you

		prevent even blders. getting what they have “earned”?  Won’t

		you have to let them all have their next revision (i.e. up to level

		of 112).



E.B.	Don’t volunteer that.



T.W.	No figure (112).

	More piece-rates.

	But much where you can’t apply piece-rate system.

	Loyalty of workers – fear of losing next election.  They are more 

		ready to accept standstill than they have at any earlier time.



H.M.	Earnings.  Not less than 75% earn above basic rate.



			Agreed:  E.B., R.S.C. &amp; G.A.I. to see T.U.C. on these lines.



			                                             [Exit  B., H.G., G.S. and J.G.





	3.	E. African Ground Nuts Scheme.



J.S.	Propose to continue on drastically curtailed basis (p. 5).  From £13 m.

		to £4.5 m. next year.

	And from now on the money will be spent mainly locally – period of

		heavy draughts on U.K. resources is ending, as heavy capital

		investment completes.  That, too, is why I cdn’t recommend

		dropping scheme.

	600.000 acres target to be reached in ’54.  W’in resources of 

		Overseas Food Corpn.

	Spent 2 yrs. in learning job.  Many mistakes.  But un-repentant.

		May prove v. important technique for Colonial developmt.



H.M.	Don’t be un-repentant about mistakes.



J.S.	No.  Shan’t make scapegoat of managing agency qua private

		enterprise.

	This type of developmt. indispensable.  Oils &amp; fats are 3 times price

		we expected.  Justifies going on with this &amp; Queensland Scheme.

	Finance Accounts.  Must get this right.  Have got Eric Coates to accept

		financial posn on Board – I.C.S. who was Finance Member in 

		India and in Germany.



P.M.	Criticism won’t be on main thing.  But tht. you started w’out enough

		prepn &amp; trial.  Were too hasty.  And had wrong people to it.

		Their estimates were wildly out.  Can you be sure next lot of

		people won’t let you down.



R.S.C.	That’s one thing.  £30 m. gone down drain.

	But also waste.  We got firm supposed to be best at this sort of thing.

		And they did things wh. no reasonable co. shd. do – e.g. no

		custody of stores.  Accountants shocked at disorder.  Unfair if 

		blame for this fell on existg. Corpn.

	Financial re-organn of co. will be necessary – in new Parlt.  In effect

		to write off large part of their capital.

	Only alternative to M/F. plan wd. have bn. to limit to 300.000 acres.

		But 600.000 is more likely to give good economic result.  Tho’

		it will cost another 15 m.

C.J.	Transfer of capital works to Tangan. Govt.?



R.S.C.	Taken roughly into a/c.  But shan’t be able to fund capital or pay

		interest.



H.M.	Apportiong. blame.  Don’t suggest no blame rests on Corpn.

		Also Govt. must accept share.  For we went into this w’out

		fullest investign, with some “faith”.  We cdn’t have made quite

		sure:  but we cd. have made more sure.  We cd. have had pilot

		plant experiment &amp; (wisdom after event) we shd. have done.

	Even in this memo. there is wishful thinking.  Do we still know

		enough about insect risks, water etc., etc.  Cd. we not get best

		scientific advice?  Truman’s 4th Point &amp; U.N. technical assistce.

		Can’t we bring them in?  All the world wants to know if this 

		developmt. is sound.  The sooner we know wtr. it’s scientifically

		possible, the better.  Tizard &amp; C.O. scientists cd. do more to help.



N.B.	Principle of this is vital to Comm.  And eyes of world are on us.

	Easy to say now we shd. have had pilot plant.  But we were impressed

		with time factor.  I still think it was right to take the risk.

	These sorts of enterprise, even by private C.O.S., make big losses at

		outset.



C.J.	Studied at outset, not only by scientists, but by commercial people

		with knowledge of Africa.

	Take credit also for contns to welfare &amp; developmt. of Africa.

	When Corpn took over, they know chaos of accounts &amp; diffies with

		contractors &amp; said so.

	Support 600.000 acres scheme.  But even then v. big risks – for 

		causes mentioned by H.M.  Alleged by Oppn – insufft. Parly.

		control.  Somethg. in that.  a) Transfer to Col. Dev. Corpn.

		No:  they have too much to do already.

	Discns with Tangan. Govt. on reliefs to Corpn on a/c assets they have

		created.



J.	M/F. won’t get away with this if unrepentant.

	Can’t defend failure to get nuts by claimg. benefits to Africa.

	Admit the mistakes &amp; let blame rest where it lies.

	H/C. will want to be sure you have now got best Bd. incldg. people

		who really know about Africa.



R.S.C.	It is they precisely who let us down before.



J.	Believe there is still wishful thinking in new estimates.



E.B.	Wasn’t here when this was decided (?).  Amazed, however, tht. you

		designed a scheme wh. was to cover its cost fr. outset – tho’

		here in U.K. there’s hardly an article of food that isn’t 

		subsidised.  cf. Sugar-beet.  Subsidy:  even tho’ social developmt.

		was all paid for by l.a.’s.

	Take blame for past.

	But can you afford not to grow groundnuts in Comm.  cf. last war,

		when nitro-glycerine etc., was threatened.  Surely that is essential

		on “strategic” grounds, peace &amp; war.

	Support H.M. re scientific advice re soil.

	But you must grow them somewhere in Comm. &amp; you probably must

		subsidise them.

	Truman’s 4th point:  will discuss with R.S.C. &amp; J.S.



R.S.C.	We have already put up, for 4th point aid schemes, covering all the

		money we are likely to get.  And we have had all the scientific

		advice we need on nuts – its commercial experience.



G.A.I.	Are we sure Plummer is right man?



J.S.	Yes:  no doubt of his business ability.



A.              	a)  Frankness essential in Debate.

                  	b)  Support E.B.’s point tht. this cd. never have bn. expected to pay its

		way.

                  	c)  Are we clear tht. southern area will yield 450.000 acres &amp; that it’s 

		right place.  Support H.M.’s plea for more certain scientific

		advice on that before we open up that terrain.

                  	d)  Not impressed by proposed new Board.  Must be ruthless, &amp; get

		v. best men.



J.S.	Answer to c) is in Scientific pt. in Annual Rpt.  The amount of 

		scientific work is beyond that sort of criticism.  We can’t go

		v. fast in opening up the south.  Only 200.000 acres this comg.

		year.



T.W.	Can’t scrap scheme.  But capital lost.  Can’t therefore be 

		self-balancing commercial scheme.  May be an Empire asset.

		Don’t pretend it’s more.



H.D.	Surprised we are keeping w’in the £50 m.  Can we complete

		installations at that?



J.S.	Yes:  with acreage at restricted figure.



H.D.	But you must write it off because a) much wasted  b) much never shd.

		have bn. charged v. the Corpn.



H.W.	One subject wh. may be raised – failure to keep proper accounts.

		Auditors’ comments will be exploited by Opposn.

	Also pressure for enquiry e.g. Royal Commn.



J.S.	Managing agency (16 mos.) failed to keep proper a/c’s.  For they

		made heavy purchases of war-stores.  Had to buy in lots.



		They arrived un-catalogued, unsorted, unpriced.  And agency 

		failed to do this.

			Agreed as in memo.  M/F. and Col. Secy. to spk.



A.V.A.	Are we agreed on composn of Board?



A.	I’m not.



J.S.	Finance member crucial.  V. lucky to get Coates.

	Adminn.  Perrott is v. good.  Knows scheme v. well.  Seconded for

		2 yrs. as Deputy Chairman.



R.S.C.	Plus 2 part-time business men of 1st rank.



P.M.	Get them announced before Debate.			[Exit  J.S.





	4.	Size of Newspapers.



H.W.	Stocks are embarrassingly high.  Made fr. non-dollar materials.

	Most anxious to free periodicals.  Mainly made of non newsprint.

		With control, even at 70%, we’re having to m’tain a sort of 

		censorship.  But tht. wd. cause diffy. with newspp. unless I

		can make some concession to them.  (Because competn in

		advertising.)



H.M.	Para. 3.  Cdn’t you export some?



R.S.C.	Mustn’t limit exports, esp. to Australia.

		Can’t let Canadian objns prevent it:  for Can. supplying Austr.

		means dollar expendre by sterling area.

		Must send every practicable export to Australia.  Peculiar 

		market for this.

	No export ceiling.



H.W.	Austr. won’t spend more Can. dollars on newsprint if they don’t 

		get this.  But Can. don’t want us in Austr. market.  They are

		touchy about newsprint.



R.S.C.	I wd. accept de-control of periodicals.



H.M.	Wd make it easier to publish “Action”.

	I wd. give the 7 pp. for Election:  but no the other.

			Agreed:    Free periodicals.

			               {Sell to Australia.

			               {Offer 7 pp. newspaper during Election.









	5.	Amendment of Canadian Constitution.



N.B.	As in memo.

	Want Bill before Christmas.

			Approved.
