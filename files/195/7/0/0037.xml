C.M. 41 (49)					20th June, 1949



1.	      Industrial Disputes.



G.A.I.	Rlways.	Confce this p.m. on wages – other diffies out of way.

	Electricity	Ev. Stand. rpt. is mares-nest.  Agreemt. made by Comm. dominated Union.  No reason to expect other Unions will make trouble.

	Docks.	2 Canadian ships in Ldn.  Dockers declined to unload.  Barrett, Gen. Secy. Stev. Union, said told them not to work:  if proves correct, will report to H.O.  300 men off.  Employers are considerg.  posn.

			Action will have to be taken to unload if men decline.

			Apart fr. this Ldn. trouble, all clear.

			T. &amp; G.W. Union have put facts well to their men.

			Stevedores Union are not reasonable.



A.V.A.	Is it wise to suspend the 300?  May turn it into lock-out.



A.B.	Can’t allow B. to run us.





2.	     Iron and Steel Bill.



G.S.	We shd. not in fact rest until after Genl. Election.  H/L. will insist on doing by amendmt what we have agreed among ourselves is inevitable.

	If we meet H/L, we can get Bill by end/July.

	Unwise to leave it v. late. e.g. Dec or Jan &amp; have to reach agreemt. by concession then.  On balance I favour meeting H/L. view.



A.	H/L will press 2 amendmts.  Proposal for I &amp; Steel Bd. (5th wheel) they will press but not to last ditch.  Date = last ditch proposal.

	Dpt. has some amendmts.  If Bill is rejected, these can’t be included because must be Bill as first passed by H/C.  This is an argument for getting Bill passed by H/L.

	Looks as tho’ Minister wd. have to announce early in 1950 a later date.  Won’t look well.

	I favour trying for compromise on date.

	Suppose an earlier election &amp; Bill rejected, might not get Bill at all.

	Salisbury’s proposal prob. wdn’t be pressed if we offered at date after the Election.

	Make sure of getting your Bill &amp; take chance of amending it in H/L. to make it a better Bill.



A.V.A.	Workers in Steel industry will ask:  why did we amend Parlt. Act.  Was it not to push our p’mme thro’ in this Parlt.  Opposn have made it clear tht. if they are returned they won’t bring this Bill into opern.

		This will do us much harm.

	But M/S may say he can’t bring it into opn on 1.5.50.

T.W.	We shall have to defer opn, even if we get Bill.  So anyhow it’s bound to be an issue at Election.

	Workers have no real argument v. A’s plan.

	Favour compromising with H/L.



A.B.	What do we want?  Not the Bill.  Natn of steel industry.

	Whatever compromises we make, we can’t nationalise steel before Election.

	So let us make H/L responsible for our not being able to nationalise steel.

	Don’t accept their views that we need another mandate.

	Simple issue:  we must not compromise with H/L.

	Best platform for us is to m’tain tht. H/L. is responsible for the delay.

	Compromise with H/L. wd. admit their right.



G.S.	No.  We put responsibility for delay on H/L anyhow.  Ques. is merely wtr. we do so now or later, early next year.  Only ques.:  when we say it.



H.D.	Political mistake to alter the date.

	No value to get Bill, unless we win Election.  If we do, we can alter Act if we want to.

	The Dpl. amendmts. can’t weigh in the balance.  



G.S.	Agree they aren’t important.



R.S.C.	Unfortunate at this stage to give way to H/L.

	Only case for it wd. be if Election were to be in Autumn:  and you cd. then stick to date in Bill.  If Election is later, it has no significance.



W.W.	M/S. dealt with this in H/C.  For Bill provides for delaying resting for 18 months after [1/5/50] or [Royal Assent].



P.M.	Am disposed to stand fast.



A.	If so, must pass under Parlt. Act.  Prob. not until spring.  Then you can blame H/L. for delay.  But if an early election, you won’t have a Bill at all.



A.B.	H/L. issue is v. much alive in country.  Don’t deprive me of my chance to vilify it.



A.	Remember that so far H/L. haven’t rejected anything.



N.B.	No compromise with H/L.  Wd. discourage the Party.



			Agreed:  Resist amendment.



				[Exit  G.S. &amp; W.W.

3.	     Liberalisation of Trade.		         [Enter C.M.



P.M.	Leak in Sunday Press.



H.W.	From Paris.  All 18 countries have it.



H.M.	This means not by written answer.



H.W.	Short notice.

	Events over week-end have overtaken memo.

	Proposed writer to avoid ques. on tariffs because Cab. wdn’t have bn. able to consider that diff. ques.

	Tho’ in prelimy consultns with industry on Thursday, no one raised the tariff ques.

	W-end changes.

(i)	U.S. said they wd. rather we didn’t make statement.

(ii)	Canada has gone up in flames &amp; are sending Robertson over to-day.

(iii)	Makes p’ponement inevitable.  Tho’ may be election tactics.

(iv)	O.E.E.C. have decided to delay publicn until after Brussels mtg.

	Wd. therefore have w’drawn proposal, but for the leak in the Press.

	That being so, can’t avoid answering ques. “is this true?”



R.S.C.	You cd. stall, on basis tht. this is to be discussed at Brussels.



A.B.	A competent Opposn wd. never accept that.



H.M.	Cd. say discussions aren’t completed.  But they may ask wtr. we are takg. initiative &amp; if that’s admitted they might get Adjournment.

	Don’t like the politics of this anyhow.



R.S.C.	All that’s happened so far is tht. the Consultve Group have suggested tht. President shd. advise O.E.E.C. to take into considn a scheme for liberalisation of trade.  Won’t even come fwd. at all (and anyhow not until 29/6 mtg. in Paris) unless Paymts Scheme is altered.

		It’s only a v. early &amp; provisional proposal.

	Wdn’t have proposed to publish at all if it hadn’t bn. thought O.E.E.C. were going to publish to-day.  Not bound to take similar a/c of unofficial leakage.



T.W.	Hope we can make oral statement on Thursd. – after discn with U.S. &amp; Canada.



H.W.	We cd. do it, qua time.  But if oral statement, Cab. or E.P.C. must consider what can be said on tariff ques.



P.M.	They are bound to ask wtr. this affects Imp. Pref.  

H.W. 	Can say “No”.



P.M.	Then they will say can we raise tariff – “no new preference” rule, etc.



A.B.	Must handle this offensively.  Opposn bawling about European Unity.

		Here we are trying to intergrate Eur. economy – and Opposn criticise it.

		Modernisation of Eur. trade to underpin Strasbourg.



P.M.	But in a stalling reply all damaging points will come out and our offensive line can’t be taken.



C.M.	F.O. wd. welcome a chance to clear points satisfactorily with U.S.A.



H.W.	Other positive arguments.

			ii) Opposn pressure to remove import Licensing.

			iii) Opposn criticism of import restce abroad.

	But must get a line on tariff ques.  Cab. on Thursday.



P.M.           x/	V. well.  M’while, if P.N.Q. promise full statement on Thursday.



A.B.	Get our general case put first, before a no. of separate interests begin to launch attacks.  Must to be said for encouraging early Debate.



R.S.C.	Relate this to dollar diffies etc.

	Wait &amp; be sure it’s going through.



			Agreed as at x/.  Don’t put P.Q. down for Thursday.

	                                              If there is one, answer it.  If not, make

			                            statement after Ques.



H.D.	Dislike present draft.  Long.  “Liberalisation” shd. be avoided.

		Free Trade smell about this: &amp; we aren’t a Fr. Trade Party.





4.	      Political Activities of Civil Servants.

					        [Enter E.E.B.

R.S.C.	A good report.  Unanimous save on one small point.

	Recommend Cab. to accept Rpt.



P.M.	I agree.



A.W.	In l.a. elections, other Parties than Labour Party can let C.S. stand because they purport to be non-political.  E.g.  they have persuaded Ministers of religion to stand.



A.B.	Accept Rpt.



H.M.	Consequential ques. wh. will have to be considered by some Cttee.

	E.g. one month’s special leave to stand as candidate.  Shd. be w’out pay.

	Case which arose in C.O.I.  Civil Servant who wanted to stand, not only for Boro’, but also for L.C.C.  Must be some limit on amount of time which is involved.



A.V.A.	Appln to Services will be considered by Service Ministers Cttee to-morrow. Hope R.S.C. will take a/c of any points they wish to raise.

		E.g. Para. 58.

	Have worked on O-in-C of 1927.  But members of Services have enjoyed privileges under Act of 1939.  That will have to be considered.



H.M.	Wd. like Ty. to consider one further point.

	Ty. Solr. has advised tht. members of Bds. wd. come under “persons employed in Crown Service”.  They shd. not be covered, as Civil Servants.



P.M.	Ty. circular shd. come in draft to L.P. Cttee.



H.D.	Civil Servants above the line standing at l.a. elections.  Needs further thought.  They will be opposing political candidates.  Better either to say don’t stand at all, or stand with discretion.



R.S.C.	That re-opens Rpt.  Want to accept this Rpt. in toto.



H.M.	Rpt. seems to imply that a man can stand as a Party Candidate.



E.E.B.	H’to no general Ty-rule – left to Dpts.  Wants tidying up.

	Para. 89:  Heads of Dpts – meets M/H point.

	For the rest, to be logical, you wd. have to exclude everyone who might get related to nat. politics.  Didn’t want to do that because many are in fact doing so with discretion.

	Believe it can be made to work.



			Agreed:  Accept Report “broadly”.





5.	     Council of Europe.



H.M.	Preparatory Commn have met &amp; are proposing to issue communiqué, on 22/6.

	Is it w’in their discretion?  Or wd. Cab. wish to consider it?

	Read terms of communiqué.

	Radio &amp; cinema are to be given facilities.  Shd. deprecate it if they x/ were there all through.

	Don’t like dates.  Don’t like arrangemt. of Hall.



C.M.	Commn is working ad referendum

i)	To Govts. &amp; later

ii)	To Assembly when it meets in August.

	If we want to reserve right to object to x/, we cd. telephone to Paris.



			Agreed:  Ask Commn to omit refce to cinema &amp; radio.
