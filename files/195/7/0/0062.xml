C.M. 69 (49)					1st December, 1949



1.	     Parliament.



H.M.	Business for next week.



N.B.	India Bill.  Govt./India have agreed.  Am consulting Opposn.



A	Parliament Bill.  Agreed that vote on 2nd Rdg. in H/L. will be treated as a rejection – authies in both Houses are agreed.



A.	Parliament Square Bill.  Any opposition?



H.M.	M’sex Co. Council can’t be squared.  If we can’t get it thro’ we must try to carry it over.



A.	F/Britain Bill we can get thro’.  But little chance of getting the other thro’ if opposed.





2.	     Conversion of Exchequer Bonds.



R.S.C.	£760 m.  Exch. Bonds due redemptn in Feb.  13/4%.

	Propose to offer conversion at 21/4% par for 5 years.

	Will announce this to-morrow,

	U.K.	&amp; Indian Govts. hold a big proportion.



H.D.	Pity to have to offer a higher interest rate.

					[Enter Mayhew



3.	     Council of Europe.



H.M.	Cttee of Ministers decided Steering Cttee could meet as proposed.

		General Affairs Cttee

		Privilege Cttee.

	But deprecated mtgs. of other Cttee’s – tho’ some already called for Dec.

	Secretariat have convened mtgs., basis tht. each Govt. pays own delegates’ expenses.  Thus Cttee defied:  E.B. thinks we shd. decline to pay our delegates’ expenses &amp; refuse francs.  Tho’ European Movemt. may pay both.

	Mtg. of Labour repves – H.D. in Chair.



H.D.	Good repn of those who were at Strasbourg.  I expd no view.  I think we must either tell them not to go or let them go and pay ourselves.

		View of mtg.  Eccles will go anyway.  If our chaps don’t go there will be trouble here &amp; Tories can say we aren’t supportg. Council.

		Moreover, trouble in Europe – U.K. dragging feet.  Br. Labour Party &amp; Govt. will be blamed.

	My concln.  We shd. do what other Govts. are going to do.  All have bn. flouted:  if they wd. all resist we shd. support them.  As they won’t, we shdn’t be isolated.  Recommend therefore we find out what others are going to do &amp; follow majority.



W.W.	Tried to p’pone mtgs because Parlt. sitting – until close to Assembly, in Easter or Whitsun.  Put this to Opposn Whip – haven’t had reply.

	But at mtg. strong Labour feeling it shdn’t be later than January.



H.M.	Date “near Assembly” isn’t satisfied by Easter or Whitsun.



C.M.	Unlikely we can p’pone now – too late.

	E.B.’s view:  we shdn’t not associate ourselves with this defiance of Cttee of Ministers.  Proposed to meet in Paris, not Strasbourg – much too close to O.E.E.C.  This is quite important matter of principle on wh. to give way.  Cttee of Ministers unanimous in favour of this decision.

	Have asked other Govts. for re-actions (24 hrs. ago) indicatg. our provl view.  Even if they are weak, E.B. wd. stand firm.



R.S.C.	This is challenge fr. dissident minority in Cttee of Ministers – plus Reynaud plus Spaak/Van Zeeland diffies.

	Most awkward tht. this shd. meet in Paris.  Diff. discns now procedg. in O.E.E.C. – wh. wd. be impaired by any Demarche of Europ. Movemt. at such a mtg.  Esp. if picked up by U.S. (Harriman).

	Real challenge to method of Europ. co-opn thro’ Govts. – in O.E.E.C.



A.B.	Support F.O. view and action.



P.M.	Pity F.O. didn’t get other Govts. to support the common line.



H.D.	The Cttee  will meet.  Eccles will go &amp; will be able to get francs w’out Ty. help.  Lee &amp; Edilman will do as they are told.



R.S.C.	Scandinavians will expect us to give a lead.



A.B.	Can’t we assume tht. decns of Cttee of Ministers will be enforced by Govts?



R.S.C.	Some Ministers are running away.



A.B.	But E.B. shdn’t run away.



P.M.	If we take a line, we shd. say why in public, and tell our people not to go.



N.B.	If other Govts. do support mtg. I support H.D.’s view on our staying away.



A.W.	If you don’t stand up to this, all Cttees can meet as they like and authy. of Cttee of Ministers is gone.



A.	Support that view.



P.M.	Tell our people not to go, make a public explann.



H.D.	Then every effort shd. be made, thro’ diplomatic channels, to see that we are not alone.



C.M.	 P.Q. in H/C. by Monday – arranged Quesn.



H.D.	Tell our 2 chaps tht. this is the line.  (H.M. to do this).





4.	     Legislative Programme:  1950 Session.

						 [Exit C.M.



H.M.	Not v. exciting.  A.V.A. has now agreed to drop Cts. Martial Bill.

		Hoped Leasehold Bill might be ready.



J.	Might be a starter.  



R.S.C.	Wd. take a long time to draft Bill – cdn’t be ready for next Session.



A.B.	Told new Chairman (Jenkins) is so re-actionary you won’t get anything helpful.  Play it slow.  Don’t want such a Rpt. before Election.



C.E.	Allied Forces.  May be urgent.



J.	Dipl. Privileges.  P’pone because Tass enquiry. 



N.B.	Also because C.R.O.



			Agreed:  Legn Cttee to supervise.
