C.M. 26(49)							7th April 1949



		1.	Parliament.				[Enter W.W.

								[E.Sh. and A.H.

H.M.	Business for next week.

							[Exit W.W.



		2.	Remuneration of Trained Nurses.



A.B.	General case for improved remuneration is accepted, even by Ty., and supported by M/L. as means of securing necessary recruitment.

	Difficulty only in respect of highest points on grade, equal pay point.

	Relations with teachers kept under control.  No difficulty – save on equal pay in top points.  I can only meet the differential point by increasing pay of males.  I can’t defend reducing female rate.



W.G.H.	Not a large point – few male nurses.

	Don’t want to increase pressure for equal pay for teachers.



A.B.	How am I to meet Ty. view?  If female pay is right, and differential is essential, I must pay more to males.



H.M.	Don’t like memo. Para. 2(b) doesn’t give concessions made or their cost.

	P. 2 doesn’t give facts v. men’s scales.  Para. 5 no facts.

	What will be addl. cost when full nos. of nurses needed have bn. recruited?

	Argument of net cost shdn’t be used. (H.D. agreed).

	Tables : we don’t know what emoluments will be.



A.B.	Memo. for Cabinet can be confined to matters of difference betwn my Dpt. and Ty.



H.M.	Matters of importance come to Cabinet, even if no inter-Departmental difference.



G.T.	These scales do accept principle of equal pay.  Bound to increase pressure for it in other fields, esp. teachers, who will assume Govt. have here implemented the principle.  Burnham Cttee have bn. resistg. pressure for it.  L.a.s won’t be able to stand out against it.  For nurses it might cost £½ m. : for teachers £13/14 m.  I cdn’t limit it to the top of the scale.

	Also concerned tht. teachers and nurses drawn fr. same reservoir.  It’s not big enough at present.  That will have to be considered later.

	Suggest Ty. shd. work out difft. scale not admittg. principle of equal pay.



G.A.I.	Increased pay is essential to recruitment.



	Without it we can’t get girls out of the commercial jobs they take betwn. ages 16/18.

	We have accepted principle of equal pay.  This is only a v. limited appln of it.  Will it really do much harm?  Only after 15 yrs’ service.



P.M.	We accept principle, but can’t apply it all round.  Doesn’t mean we must insist on principle of inequality.



A.W.	Have applied it to doctors.



	This is equal pay on basis of women’s pay.  Teachers want it on basis of men’s pay.



P.M.	Pressure won’t be avoided – wthr. we do this or don’t.



H.D.	Will this involve Suppl.  Estimate this year?



A.B.	Yes.  I said in H/C. on earlier Suppl. tht. further one wd. be needed in respect of nurses’ claim.  Can’t avoid them on wage increases.



W.G.H.	Chancellor’s view.  He accepts subject to point about equal pay.

		x/ Agreed, subject to personal concurrence of R.S.C.



A.H.	Services have same shortage of nurses.  W. party on pay now sitting.

	Under 2.000 nurses.  No males.  Females’ pay related to civil nurses’ pay (Rushcliffe scales).



W.G.H.	Is it certain this will need a Supplementary?

		Agreed as at x/.

						           [Exit A.H.

						           [Enter Henderson. S-Genl.

						           [Kirkpatrick.

		3.	Germany : Occupation Statute.



P.M.	U.S. have veered round to view : give German Govt. a free hand subject to veto of Occupying Power.

	Separate Mil. and Civilian.  Put in Civilian control + troops.

	Finance : a) principles 2027  b) 2028.

	Spoken to E.B.  He thinks it in line with earlier U.K. views.



I.K.	E.C.A. fears in memo.  Telegr. since : U.S. claim, after E.C.A. clearance, to have strong weighted voting on certain matters.  But Army vote will go over to E.C.A.  On balance, we gain financially : tho’ weighted voting will give rise to local friction in adminn.



H.W.	a)  If more time, shd. have liked E.B. to try again on weighted voting and also on control of G. trading practices and discrimn. (internal and external) v. B. trade.



	Troubles in past over weighted voting.  Even if Clay goes, U.S. civilians won’t administer G. industry on lines agreeable to us.  Risk of rise of new G. industrial system.



	Hope E.B. will fight to last on this.



	b)  On simplified draft, much less to prevent G. brkg. out on cartels and Shachtian methods of trade.  Not so tight as our earlier form of words.



	Dangerous.  But we can’t resist because time-table and Fr. going over to U.S. side.



E.Sh.	W.O. interest in one aspect.  All Army requiremts. recd. free of charge under terms of surrender.  Glad to see this covered in (b) of Addendum.  Is it clear we go on as now?  Or will there be a ceiling for us? Wd. affect our Estimates.  Can I have assurance on this?



W.G.H.	What about 2nd (b)? Does this go back on it?



I.K.	Occupn costs : claims on Germany : repaymt. of sterling expenditure on G.  2028.  (e) = guarantees first (W.O. point is therefore covered – tho’ U.S. may press us to reduce costs).  Second is covered.  I am doubtful wthr. third is covered.



P.M.	Shd. we have got any more out of our draft Statute?  We shd. have had to work with U.S. anyhow.



J.	E.B. knows all these points: must have discretion to agree.



P.M. 	Tell E.B. we are disturbed about trade ques. and recovery of sterling expendre on G’s behalf : but leave him to do the best he can.



H.D.	Distaste for pouring out sterling w’out repayment.



G.H.	Asked for time to think up safeguards.



P.M.	a)  No room for them on this form of draft.

	b)  E.B. will want to get pol. advantages of agreement quick.



A.W.	Suggest, after agreemt. discn betwn. 3 Powers on means of using genl. powers of veto to secure our safeguards.



S-Genl.	Think this preferable because earlier draft might have bn. said to confer sovereignty on G.



	Sectn 6.  Resume authy if thought “desirable” (not essential) : E.B. consider drafting.
