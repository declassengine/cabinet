	Col. Govts. consulted &amp; agreed.

	M/State suggested para. on double taxn.  Willing to add.

	B/T. asks p’ponement until W’ton talks.  No objn so long as we can make a statement to Overseas Terries Cttee of E.E.E.C. in 3 wks. time – based on this.

	B/T suggn re controls over colonial investment – not clear over this.  Want further discn with Ty. on it implications.



P.M.	“Pattern” in para. 3.  Amend.

	Odd to make it unprovoked, in Parlt.  Certainly not before Recess.

	Support incln of refce to double taxation.



			Agreed in principle:  delay announcement: B/T. Ty., &amp; C.O. to discuss points raised:  consider form &amp; timing in connn. W’ton briefs:  some genl. statement can be made to O.E.E.C.





2.	    Economic Situation.    Interim Measures by Canada and U.S.A.



U.S.A.



H.W.	Stockpiling, Bank &amp; Fund.  O.F. to enquire.

	Synthetic rubber:  leave pro. tem. because they’ve done something.

	Tariff adminn:  discuss with Hoffman in Ldn.  Coming 12/8.



O.F.	U.S. Secy. Agric. coming Ldn Aug.  Financg. Canadian wheat under E.R.P. is most important of our suggns.  U.S. Agric. + Hoffman are the 2 interests.  Cd. he be worked on here?  Wd. help E.C.A.



H.W.	We shd. try to nobble him.



J.S.	Discussed with Chairman F.A.O.  He wasn’t w’out hope.  For crops turning out low.



			Agreed:  H.W. to initiate entertainment.



H.W.	Para. 2 (b)	N.Z. might enquire.  Otherwise await W’ton.

	Para 2  (c)	Await W’ton.



	Canada.  Part B. of C.P. 165 and whole of C.P 169.



H.W.	On main issue must tackle them some time.  But if we raise it now, they will at once say “why didn’t R.S.C. raise it in July?”  Will assume a change of policy because R.S.C.’s absence.  They think we have p’poned it until Sept.

	Want to get them on our side in W’ton.  Must have discns therefore before Sept.  R.S.C. can’t go to Ottawa first.  Method: prs. mtg. of Anglo-Can Continuing Cttee just before W’ton talks.  And raise it then.

	Agree timing?  Leave method to P.M. to decide.



A.	Gt. care is necessary.  This will be rude shock to Canada.

	Tell Clutterbuck &amp; ask his advice on method.



H.W.	Recall him for consultn on methods.



J.	If Canada appreciates facts, concln follows.  Do they?



H.W.	Better than anyone in world.  Best informed group in Commonwealth.

		But “v. pig-headed and v. liberal.”

	Expecting us to find a way of enabling them to go on living in 19th century.



P.M.	Long-term.  Let it develop.



A.B.	But worst cause of our troubles.  We are financing her uncontrolled dollar imports.  Relying on efforts of planned economics to enable them to enjoy contd luxury of liberal trading.



H.D.	Heads in sand:  needs rude shock to get them out.

	Cdn’t P.M. open it in personal message to St Laurent – we shall want to talk, will you begin to think?



H.W.	After consultn with Clutterbuck.  He might take message back.



J.S.	Line shd. be: as contracts fall in, we can’t renew them except on basis of sterling payments.  Bacon &amp; eggs fall in at end ’49:  March for cheese.  Timber at end/year.



			Agreed:  Consult Cl. on timing &amp; method.

			               Consult Cl. also on method of approach for points   	               in Part B. of C.P. 165.



C.M.	Must realise we mayn’t get any decisions until W’ton talks.



P.M.	But don’t muffle the shock.



H.D.	Ty. memo.  U.K. investment in Canada.  V. relevant figure.

		Keep in mind possibility of mobilising some of these – as Argentine rlways.



P.M.	Allotted to debt?



D.J.	Canadians.  War debt.  But some room for “mobilising.”



H.W.	Cd. do it if we say we had a long-term solution.



H.G.	Be sure that we have the means to mobilise in emergency.



			Agreed:  Ty. to enquire.





3.	    Economic Situation.



P.M.	L.P.’s memo. shd. be studied.

	All ministers shd. avoid or at least keep down Suppl. Estimates.

		And cut out all that isn’t necessary.  All Dpt. Ministers shd. enquire into it.



H.W.	Directive by P.M.  Suggesting aiming at 5%.  Some Ministers not in our discussions.



P.M.	Will issue a directive.  Don’t favour a figure.  Hits the most economical hardest:  reflect no priorities.  Wd. prefer to ask them to submit their proposals.



A.B.	Don’t like Directive from one Minister to another.  What of collective responsibility.



P.M.	Remember tempo.  Many things cd. be slowed down w’out loss.

		Ask Ministers to report what things cd. be reduced or delayed.

		Basis:  reduction of expenditure – including expre on staff.



A.	Why do we have to meet capital expenditure from revenue.



			Agreed.



P.M.		a) Gt. care to avoid encouraging talk of devaluation.

		b) Avoid speculation.

		c) If emergency arises, I must have authority to act with such colleagues as are here.

			Re-convening absent Ministers wd. increase atmosphere of crisis.
