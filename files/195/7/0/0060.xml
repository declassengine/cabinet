	1.	Parliament.



H.M.	Business for next week.

	Thursday – Debate on Wales.  Will be general.  Suggest M/N.I.

		might open.  H.M. &amp; Ch. Whip to decide.

	Sea Fish Industry Bill.  Technical point arisen requiring Fin. Resoln.

		Awkward for time.  Prefer J/P Bill.  Suggest T.W. concurring

		and A.W. acquiescing) we let it drop.



A.W.	Ready to drop it, if Whips so desire.



T.W.	Decontrol of fish – decided since introdn of Bill – will create new

		condns.  Can’t say wtr. some parts (Cl. 3) of Bill will now work.

		M/F. find anyhow they can’t work it w’out devolution of powers

		to l.a.’s.

	But M/T. may want small M. Shipping Bill for Cl. 2 provns re

		accommodn in ships.



W.W.	Haven’t time for re-committal etc., - tho’ we cd. get it as it stands.



T.W.	New M/F. proposals wd. involve much discn in H/C.



P.M.	Cd you drop some parts?



T.W.	No.

			Agreed:  drop this Bill.



J.	P.Q. to Att. Gen. by Piratin M.P.  Tuesday.		[Enter  A.G.

	Cl. v. sub-leasing to coloured person.

	Ques. might come to courts wtr. such a sub-lease depreciates value

		of propy.

	Inclined to say too late in Session for fresh legn.



Att.G.	May be held illegal now as contrary to common law.



J.	Diffies in H/L. over Developmt. Values.

	Awkward examples quoted of wide swings in D. Valuers’ valuations.

	Adminn is evidently awry.  Had to promise investign.



A.B.	Similar cases repd to me at central Housg. Advisory Cttee.



P.M.	Let L.P. Cttee consider with M/T.C.P.



R.S.C.	Better have 2 or 3 Ministers with Ch. Valuer.



P.M.	I will appoint a few such Ministers.





	2.	Wages Policy:  Shipbuilding.



G.A.I.	Conference – will take usual course, beginning with refusal.

	Shd. I intervene, or wait until employers have refused.

	I think not, esp. as T.U.C. final decln not made public.

			Agreed.





	3.	India (Consequential Provision) Bill.



N.B.	For report, not decision.

	Bajpai hopes to persuade Govr. of India to accept “holding” Bill on 

		lines desired by Cabinet.  Will telegraph to us when views of 

		Govt. known.



Att.G.	Draft doesn’t advertise diffies.		[Exit  Att. Gen.





	4.	Council of Europe  -  Meeting of Committee of Ministers.



E.B.	For informn mainly.



A.B.	New admissions = Austria?



E.B.	Prefer to wait until troops w’drawn fr. Austria.  When that is done,

		she will get in easily.

	In debate to-day can’t refer to Directive.  Shall say I can’t prejudge

		discussions of High Commrs with Adenauer.  But will promise

		White Paper when those discns are completed.  They will then ask

		for another Debate.  But not until after Xmas.



H.M.	a)  Cttees of Council.  Suggn tht. they shd. have a fixed Budget.



E.B.	Standg. Cttee have sent acid reply, rather foolishly.

	Secretariat, at Sandy’s initiative, suggested they shd. pay delegates’

		expenses.  

		That wd. mean we shd. pay high expenses of Turks &amp; lose all

		control.  I insisted each shd. pay its own expenses, and control

		no. of mtgs.  Real ques. is, not wtr. Cttees meet, but where control

		of expenditure shall lie.



H.D.	Assembly are happy over Cttee’s concln, save on this one point.

	Pity the reply cdn’t have bn. given orally.



E.B.	Schuman did meet Spaak &amp; explained it.



R.S.C.	b)  Must prevent establmt of economic organisation.  This is what 

		is real purpose of Cttees.





E.B.	Mustn’t allow O.E.E.C. to become tools of Council of Europe.  For

		O.E.E.C. are officials &amp; they mustn’t be subject to dirn or 

		control of internatl Ministerial bodies outside our control.



H.M.	c)  Substitutes.  Want it to go.  Hope Cttee of Ministers will find a

		way of doing this.



E.B.	Some increase in repn nos. will be necessary.  But not the large

		increase some have suggd.



H.M.	d)  New post of Deputy Sec. Genl.  May be argument on this.  Clerk

		of Assembly might be lower in status.  Campion doesn’t want to

		do it.



E.B.	Asked Jebb &amp; Massigli to look into it.

	Trouble is:  we apptd wrong man (Halford).  Not strong enough.  Shall

		have to put in a more efficient man.



A.B.	Dangerous for Chairman to exercise such wide executive power.



H.M.	Someone has to do this sort of thing – when there’s no Leader of

		House, Whips etc.



H.M.	e)  Talk of Assembly mtg. earlier than Aug. in ’50.

		V. awkward for us if it does.  September wd. be better.





	5.	Brussels Treaty – Consultative Council.



E.B.	Done most of what we can do on social side.  Shd. get Convention

		extended to other Powers.  Then we cd. slow down &amp; reduce 

		costs.

	Military side.  France nervous of slimming down until we know where

		we are under Atlantic Pact.



J.	Cd. L.O’s be brought in at formative stage on these Conventions, and

		Treaties?

	Otherwise we may sign things we can’t implement.



R.S.C.	Mtg. of Finance Ministers?  Can we settle anything in advance of

		agreemt. with U.S.?  V. little chance of settling anything with

		Belgium.

		Hope you haven’t promised early mtg.



E.B.	Repeated Luxemburg resoln – see genl. picture to see where we stand.



A.V.A.	Def. Ministers meet in Ldn. next Wedy.







	6.	Divorce:  Instructions to Judges by Pope.



G.T.	What is effect of Papal edict tht. R.C. Judges shd. grant divorce only

		in cases where Church wd. authorise divorce.



J.	Matter for conscience of the one R.C. Judge in Divorce Ct.



E.B.	Justice must seem to be done etc.  Effect on litigants’ view of 

		impartiality.



J.	Judge has taken oath to administer justice acc. to the law.  If he

		finds he can’t, he must resign.



R.S.C.	May mean tht. no R.C. shd. be apptd in future to Divorce Ct.



P.M.	Shd. the existg. R.C. Judge remain in Divorce Ct.



A.W.	In Scotland no special Divorce Divn.



A.B.	Remember tht. Pope has.



J.	Judges on Circuit may at any time have to take divorce cases.

		Lynskey, Greene &amp; Wallington.

			Agreed:  L. Ch. to consider wtr. he can do anything &amp; if

			               so what.  (Will ask Greene.)





	7.	Meeting of Foreign Ministers of U.K., U.S. &amp; France.



H.D.	Dismantling.  Big concessn on war potential. 		[Exit  H.M.



E.B.	They haven’t reached agreed capacity of 10 m. tons – not got above

		9 m.  and wd. need more exchange to get Swedish ore to go

		higher - &amp; U.S. think they never will.

	No economic grds. for retaining steel plants.  Thyssen plant is	

		wanted because affectn &amp; regard for Thyssen family.

	Grave doubts about German mentality.  Don’t want to press French

		too far.

	Clutterbuck told me recently of pressure brght. on France to agree to

		end of repns in ’29 &amp; w’in 4 yrs. Hitler was in power in G.

	Salzgitter (?) plant:  constructed in war to work low grade indigenous

		ores.  Hard for France to accept continuance of that – built with

		Fr. slave labour.

	Capacity as they stand 1 m. tons (the disputed plants).  While

		nominally it wd. raise total to 16 m. but only 13½ m. in next

		few years.  That wd. give certain output of 11.2 m.

	Oil plants.  Only refining section is left.  Can’t produce synthetic.



	Shd. decision be imposed?  Or shd. Germans be made parties to 

		decision?

	Imposn of Versailles Treaty was continuing sore point for G. betwn.

		wars.

	Posn of McCloy.

	Ending of state of war.  Diff. to go on handling this as hostile Govt.

	But much of powers flow from this – esp. in U.S.

	Proposed to refer this to Cttee of Jurists – addg. Holland &amp; Benelux –

		&amp; this examn be finished before end of Occupn Statute.



H.D.	Financial investmt in Ruhr etc.



E.B.	Suggn (Adenauer) tht. U.S. shd. lend money to France to invest in G.

		industry.  But scouted by Acheson.

	Rumours, however, tht. MacGowan wants to renew cartel with 

		I.G. Farben and is running European integration with that 

		in view.



N.B.	Wd. like more infn to go to Doms.
