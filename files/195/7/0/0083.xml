C.M. 20(50).			                                                  6th April 1950 at 2.30 p.m.



	1.	Points Rationing for Food.	[Enter  M.W.,  H.G.



J.G.	Important pol. consns.  Reputn of Govt for “fair shares”.  If some

		foods go under counter, this will be regarded as departure

		fr. fair shares and available only to “favour”.



P.M.	Incitement to “under counter”.



M.W.	They are under counter now.  Why shd. Govt. take respons. for that.

		Grocer – safeguard is tht. he must keep his rationed customers.

	Group C. will stay under counter for some time.  Trying to get Cab.

		to agree to bring grocer’s favour into the open.

	Wd. rather take that risk than allow goods to stand un-bought.



 G.A.I.	Co-ops. do share out now – not by points.



H.G.	Group B.  Do you expect more rice.



M.W.	Not a lot.  But assume the worst, I still think in 2/3 mos. time there

		will be enough to go round.



P.M.	We can say now we are doing our best.  If we drop this, we stand

		to be blamed.



M.W.	If we retain points, we must free Group A.  For B &amp; C., we issue

		16 points a month.  So many goods are over 16 each, that

		many people won’t get even one can a month.

	Virtue of a points scheme = range of choice.  When range shrinks

		beyond a certain point, its value disappear.



J.	Back-seat driving.  Respons. Minister wants to do this:  &amp; has 

		consulted Co-op.



A.V.A.	Syrup &amp; treacle, canned fish, sweet biscuits must be protected.



E.Sh.	Scheme isn’t working now.  Face that fact.

	So long as no demand for more dollars, system shd. be dropped.

	Controls.  We claim tht. we don’t keep them for their own sake.

		If it’s not working well, drop it.



E.B.	Pity we didn’t know in Election.

	J.A. invented this 2nd currency to make goods follow the people.

		There is still movement of people.

	Don’t like throwg. all controls away at once.  Don’t like breakg.

		up machine.



A.B.	Disquiet.  Recent announcemt. of price increases.  Then we let a

		rationing scheme go.  Hauling down a banner.

		Para. 13.  Down-point them.  Dangers of retailers’ favour.

	Free Group A.  Try experiment.



H.M.	Said at Election we wd. keep on controls so long as socially 

		necessary.  Not longer.  Not controls for their own sake.

	But beware of retaining controls for sake of a slogan.

	Must we keep all elaborate mechanism going for sake of 3 or 4

		scarce articles.

	Man-power.  Inconvenience to housewife.



H.W.	Free categ. a) &amp; move into points some things like butter.

	If that can’t be done, can you link sweet biscuits with sugar &amp; some

		other things with sweet.



M.W.	Trouble:  retailers aren’t the same.

	Free a) and keep b) and c) – means no saving in staff, &amp; will cause

		much more irritn to public.



H.G.                i)  Turns on b).  a) and c) are certain (in opposite senses).  If we are 

		sure we cd. take risk on b) I cd. agree with M/F.

                        ii)  Can you work a points scheme for b) and c)?



M.W.	With 9.000 tons of sugar, we can in 8-12 wks. guarantee all in b)

		save rice will be in adequate supply.

	Continuing b) and c) alone wd. bring “fair shares” into disrepute.



H.W.	If Cab. won’t agree, inflate points mildly.  You can then see what

		the pressure is.  If points aren’t used and goods stay in shop,

		you know you are safe in ending the scheme.

			Agreed:  i)      Remove categ. a) from points.

			               ii)     Inflate points system for remainder.

			               iii)    After experience of this see if it’s safe to 

			                               remove these fr. points.

					[Exit  M.W.

					[Enter  N.B.

	2.	Gas-Workers’ Wage Claim.



N.B.	[ Not heard. ]



G.A.I.	Repercussions.  If Col. is told to reject this &amp; admits it, Govt. is seen 

                   x/		to be intervening.  Arbitration = bad for relns in industry, &amp;

		likely to result in more.  Rlways etc., are all awaitg. Budget.

		Unless that gives relief to workers, can’t hope to hold 

		wage-freeze.

		Important therefore to delay gas claim until after Budget.

	Won’t stop, in gas industry, at lowest-paid.  Relativities will be

		preserved.







A.B.	Challenged x/.  Deputn y’day on local govt. remuneration – sick

		visitors &amp; nurses.  Have resisted claim.  Have advised my

		repve on Wh. Council to resist because repercussions.  Y’day 

		I told them confidentially they must absorb the shock.  If Staff

		Side persist, arbitn is only remedy.  But when you have resisted

		up to a point, you must allow arbitn.  Thus, if increase granted, at

		least Govt, didn’t do it.

	Say:  “play it slow, resist as long as you can, &amp; if necess. go to arbitn.”



H.G.	Agree with A.B.  Disastrous repercns if Gas Council gave way.  That 

		wd. be v. hard on managemts. of other socialised industries.

	No need to be fussy about private advice from Minister.  They must

		not say Govt. ordered it.  If they want to, threaten dirn on gas

		prices.



E.Sh.	This is industry where prodn has increased (p 3).  That warrants

		increase in wages.  Don’t go beyond telling Chairman what 

		econ. consns are.



J.G.	Danger tht. all indies now being held back will burst at once after 

		Budget.



P.M.	Risk that, by holding it too long, we may discredit moderate leaders.



H.W.	Time for decn on genl. issue is after Budget.



H.M.	Gas mtg. cd. somehow be pushed off beyond Budget.

	If Ministers get into mood tht. we can’t hold this, the spiral will

		start – and the worker will be no better off.



H.D.	On immed. ques. we don’t want gas workers to jump queue.

		Surely M/Fuel must find means to play it slow for a week or

		so longer.



A.B.	Ques. to-day:  what is to be said to management side, not Unions.

	Must be more positive than E.Sh. suggests.

	Many Ministers are being positive e.g. with l. govt. workers &amp;

		teachers.



N.B.	Want to advise Gas Council to start with local variations &amp; defer

		national minimum.

			Agreed:  M/F &amp; P. shd. delay national minimum

			               for a week or so.
