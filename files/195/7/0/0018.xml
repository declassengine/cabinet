C.M. 18(49)							8th March 1949



		1.	Wheat Agreement.				[Enter J.S., D.J.



J.S.	Maximum:	go to 1.80 if essential.

	Quantity:	offer of 180 m. bushels raised to 190 m. provided R. 		party to Agreement for a large quantity and other 			importers willing to raise their bids.

Exporters nearly agreed to 500 m. importers 505 m.  But R. posn not yet clear : asking for 100 m. quota and exporters not ready to concede more than 50 m.



	Canadian wheat, U.S. threateng. to stop financing this on E.R.P.  We shd try to get this as condn. precedent to Agreemt.  Shd. we break on it?



P.M.	You expect world price to fall.  Does max. matter?



J.S.	Price is still above this maximum.



D.J.	Agree on maximum.

	On quantity – nothing above 190 m.

	On Canada : R.S.C. against makg. this a firm condn.  We mayn’t get E.R.P. for wheat.  Amb. shd. discuss this before we conclude on Wheat Agreemt. and refer back.  Better tactics than makg. this a condn of agreement.



E.B.	Can’t we take more Austr. wheat?



J.S.	Up to limit of cutting in to India’s supply – for then we shd. push India into dollar wheat.

								                           [Exit J.S.



		2.	China and South East Asia.



E.B.	Full statement of facts.  All I can recommend at this stage is a) – c).

	Trouble throughout these areas. eg. Shirer to Strang.  Br. was big country and India had some statesmen.  Dutch and Indonesians are both little people – fear of responsibility even amongst nationalists.



	China: fools’ paradise tht. this will br. Ch. not R. Commn.  All out informn suggests contrary.  Chang out of office but still has some influence.  Ch. Govt has again resigned.  Commands no confidence. Little direct B. trade or interests – tho’ invisible earnings were beginning to rise, this has all been damped down.  Comm. nibbles at barter trade.  Advising B. cos. to hang on : tho’ they may be driven out.



P.M.	Beware of giving grounds for compensn claims.	[Enter C.E.



E.B.	Am safeguarding that point – making it clear it’s their risk.



P.M.	Surprised Comms. haven’t pushed across Yangste.



E.B.	Waiting game : they believe old gang will melt away.



A.B.	Are too many conclns. being drawn fr. similarity of language of Comms.  Same thing with 19th cent. revolutions.  Doesn’t follow that it’s all controlled from Moscow.



A.V.A.	Events show tht. pol. leadership of Ch. Commn  is R. trained.

	Yangste : Comms. may be waiting until naval forces there are dissipated.

	Malaya : situatn isn’t improving as hoped.  Our Br. troops are stretched : no reserves there wh. cd. be transferred to H. Kong in case of need.



E.B.	My deductions aren’t based on language – but on turn of events and method of control.



P.M.	Nerve centre of Comm. control seems to be in H. Kong.



C.J.	Keep that dark : we want to watch them.

	Also any attempt to root it out in H. Kong wd. precipitate trouble then fr. across frontier (Comm. dominated China).  Prefer to hold back, in H. Kong, as betwn. the 2 parties.



P.M.	To what end? So that H. Kong may fall like a ripe plum.

	When we are trying to check Comm. in China.



H.M.	But surely propaganda etc. steps cd. be taken to check Comm. encroachmt. in Unions.  Hoping for the best – won’t do.

	C.O. shd. learn about politics : or Comms. will wipe them out.



C.J.	If they take active line, they will foment trouble with mainland  and destroy trade of the port.



P.M.	What long-term object?  Keep it flourishing to hand over to Comms.



C.J.	In fact v. active campaign to keep T.U.’s straight.  Also social policy.



A.V.A.	a)  Can’t prevent infiltration into H. Kong.

	b)  Can you risk a flare up in H. Kong if you can’t guarantee to reinforce it.



P.M.	Doesn’t excuse sheltering Communists.



A.B.	Why expect C.O. to have a policy when we haven’t one.

	Troops aren’t any good against this menace.

	I cd. have written these mema myself – nothing in them.  Ordinary language of Commn.

	What you want in H. Kong is good Socialists and T. Unionists.



P.M.	Narrowed his criticism down to sheltering of Comm. organn.



C.J.	We have done somethg. about that.



E.B.	Outside H. Kong we haven’t bn. able to do anything in China because U.S. were takg. the lead.  Moscow Confce of 1946 started it – U.S. regard China and Japan as their preserve.  In spite of 20/30 efforts of mine they wdn’t concert a policy with us.  Tho’ I always realised back-wash wd. come on us in S.E.A.

	Am now more concerned about Malaya than H. Kong.

		We haven’t subtlety or cruelty to deal with Asiatics.  We cdn’t do in 		India what Nehru has bn. doing.

	F.E.(O) Cttee are considering re-entry into China via trade.  Hong Kong wd. be the route for re-entry.

	Will submit further memo. on policy, in light of Cab. discussions.



E.B.	We haven’t yet come down against a Comm. Govt.  We shd. commit ourselves to hostility if we picked up leaders in H. Kong.



	Agreed : E.B. to consider wthr. a machinery for continuing consultn shd. be devised.  E.B. doubtful.  A.B. wanting a Ministerial Cab. Cttee.



A.	From where is Malaya campaign being directed?  Cdn’t we attack it at centre.



E.B.	5.000 trained murderers – many taught by us in resistance movement.

	Some Japs left.  Small directing nucleus of Communists.

	Possible trouble with U.S. – because some Americans have bn. backing Navy in Siam and we have bn. backing Army.  The two are now fighting one another.





3.	Ireland.	

				[Enter Att. Genl.

Ireland Bill.



P.M.	Put recommns as in para. 11 of C.P.(49)47.



N.B.	Endorsed these recommns.



C.E.	      “           “          “



Approved C.P.(49)47.



Anti-Partition Campaign.



C.E.	Need for tactful handling.  Foster co-opn at official or technical level on non-controversial ques.  Time for political consultn between North and South is not now.  Certainly we shd. keep out of it.



	Ireland Bill will give North all the assurances they can properly have.



N.B.	Seen McBride recently : he did not repeat suggn of mtg. B. Brooke.

	Told him we deprecated his speeches and Costello’s on anti Partn line. He apologised.  Since then Costello has spoken deprecating violence : and High Commr. has drawn special attentn to that speech.



H.M.	Eire not playing the game.  No need for this Act.

	Ulster v. un-provocative as cpd. with Eire.  Only defend themselves.

	Dulanty’s provocative statements v. political events in U.K. (Ulster). Attempt to squeeze Labour Party.  We must make our posn clear. Otherwise by interference with our politics they may put us, as a Govt. in domestic diffies.

	Militarily, Ulster is vital to us.



A.B.	Eire wd. then offer to join Atlantic Pact. 



H.M. 	Not good enough.



A.B.	Ulster returns Tories to W’minster.  We ought to organise Labour Party in Ulster. 



H.D. 	Tried – w’out success.



P.M.	Make up our minds to preserve integrity of N. Ireland.

	But what more could we do?

	

A.	Be courteous, but stiff with Eire.





[Absent 9th – 22nd March on official mission to Canada.]
