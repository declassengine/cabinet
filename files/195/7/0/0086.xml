C.M. 24 (50)					24th April, 1950



1.	    Transport Charges.



P.M.	M/T wants announce in reply to  P.Q. to-day tht. decision will be announced this week.



H.D.	Wd. next week be safer, and as good?



P.M.	He has bn. fobbing off for some time.  Impn of vacillation.  We ought to decide this week.



			Agreed:   promise statement this week.



	[Socialised Industries:  P.M.  Will take that again on Thursday next.]





2.	    Parliament:  Budget Debates.



H.M.	If we were defeated on this week’s debate, on matter of substance, we shd. resign?   Dissolution?



P.M.	I wd. point out to King that W.S.C. hasn’t majority and Labour wd. seek to defeat this.



A.B.	Suppose W.S.C. makes it clear to-day tht. basis of dividing was objn to P. Tax procedure.  Even tho’, not havg. tabled Motion, he is forced to divide on main Resolution.



H.M.	If there were 2 resolutions, we needn’t resign on merely procedural resoln.



R.S.C.	Cdn’t divide the two:  for it limits general licence to amend law for purposes of taxn.



P.M.	Unlikely they will divide to-day:  if they do, we may defeat them:  if we don’t, it must be taken as a vote v. Budget as a whole.





3.	    Gas Industry Wage Claim.



N.B.	Decn of last time was carried out by Council – but they failed to get away with it:  they were forced to approach national rates.

		The primary object of stalling until after Budget was secured:  but it’s clear we can’t avoid any longer discn of natl rates.

	Have discussed privately with T. Williamson – he says can’t go on w’out raising wages of labourers – dirty &amp; heavy work, can’t get recruits other than foreigners – no overtime, no income tax relief fr. Budget.  Gas output up by 30% &amp; costs (?wages) only by 5%.

		Urged also tht. this was w’in W. Paper policy qua low paid.

		Repercussions:  we said miners got rise before W. Paper:  tht. rlway claim cdn’t be resisted for long (policy shd. be to reduce nos. &amp; increase pay).  His influence in Union will be undermined if this claim is rejected:  then others less anxious for restraint will take his place.  Also widespread strikes – prs. nation-wide.  This wd. mean naval stokers in gas works - &amp; uncertain we’d get enough.

		Risk of explosions in mains.

	It’s suspected tht. Council’s attitude up to now is due to Govt.’s advice.

		If they are to persist in it, they will need formal direction – a v. unusual use of power to give directions.

	Therefore I submit proposals as in memo.  We shd. press both sides to make any increases minimum possible.  Believe Union wd. accept 97% as lowest rate &amp; drag out differentials for some time.  At worst, this wd. mean £1.3M:  not v. large.



G.A.I.	Cab. is becomg. wage negotiatg. Cttee.  We have as a Govt. said we 

                    x |		won’t intervene in wage negotn:  also tht. lower-paid have a good 

                       |          claim.

		We ought to say nothg. to Gas Council

            		On merits these men have good case.  Lower than roads &amp; rlway lower groups.

	We shd. stick to x/ as policy &amp; leave it all to Gas Council.

	Don’t treat this qua T. Williamson must be saved.  But if we don’t we shall be in same posn as with Deakin in dockers.

		If we lose him, we’ve lost the whole wages sitn.



R.S.C.	We have always contemplated increase for lower-paid.  If these followed our policy of restraint wd. be finished.  Ques. is therefore wtr. we can hold this to lower-paid.  Or is it 5/= all round?  If latter, it means 5/= for all industry - &amp; lower-paid will still be left behind.

	My view:  Council shd. deal only with lower-paid &amp; p’pone others until later. (much later).



P.M.	Tell Gas Council to do their best – in light of their knowledge of our genl. policy.



H.M.	Govt. have some responsibility for wages in socialised industries.

		Can’t be quite laissez-faire over them.  Right for Govt. to give some guidance to boards.

                   y.|	Ought not M/L. &amp; Ty. to submit memo. on wages policy &amp; current movements of wages.



G.A.I.	Proper for us to give genl. guidance.  But not to order a board to refuse or to grant a specific amount of increase.



N.B.	I meant nothg. inconsistent with G.A.I.’s statement.

	Didn’t propose to dictate to board – only to give hints.

P.M.	On this case, N.B.’s memo is right qua guidance.

	On genl. issue, I support y/.



A.B.	Dam is bound to break now.  Problem for us:  how far can we moderate flow.  Diff. sitn to defend:  public sector controlled, but private sector is free to do what it likes.



H.G.	Effect on gas prices?  



N.B.	Prob. a small increase, if goes beyond lower-paid workers.



A.V.A.	 Public believe these industries belong to country.  Must be a national wage policy.



E.Sh.	You cd. reconsider my 4 year old memo. – on Wages Policy.



A.B.	No retrospective paymts. for higher ranks – to be piling up which negotiations are dragging on.  Sub-para (V) shd. not be allowed to apply to higher ranks.



N.B.	I will make that plain

					     [Exit N.B. H.G.

				  [Enter B., Att. Gen.



4.	    London Dock Strike.



G.A.I.	Sitn is deterioratg.  Strike is spreading.  Discn over wk-end.

		Deakin says nothg. he can do.  20 T.U. officials have bn. at this: but anti-Deakin feeling is now such tht. he has no influence there.

	Must now allow troops in to handle ships.

	Risk tht. stevedores’ dispute will be snarled up with this.  If they support dockers, may be sitn in wh. dock strike will end only on condn tht. Shaw Savil plan is abandoned.



C.E.	Read latest Police report, showg. deterioration in situation.

	P.L.A. have submd scheme for working of port.  Decribed it.

	One trouble:  no dock is completely out.  Any troops going in will therefore increase no. of strikers.  20.000 troops can be at work in 2 wks (end of build-up).  Authy sought to put accommn for them in Ldn. parks.

	No perishable foods until Thursd.  (save one small banana boat).



H.McN.	Clyde dockers have met &amp; decided not to support strike.



C.E.	Troops.  1.000 can go into R. Docks at 2.pm to-day.



G.A.I.	Concentrate them there pro-tem. – it’s where trouble started, &amp; will show re-action at other docks.



B.	If many troops are employed we shall need an official Port Emergency Cttee.



E.Sh.	20.000 troops – v. large nos. – will upset my plans.

	This is 1st occasion on wh. we have bn. unable to tell men they shd. go to arbitn.  This arises from action of T.U.  Shd. they not have consulted M/L. on its repercussions?   Relations of M/L. and T.U. shd. be considered before troops empld on such a scale.



A.B.	This was all considered by Emergencies Cttee.  M/D. then was all for backg. up authy of Union.  On this basis we decided to put in troops.



E.Sh.	Situation has changed for me – because I didn’t then realise there was no opportunity to go to arbitn.  This embroils Govt. in a T.U. dispute.



G.A.I.	London Dock Labour Bd. – no decn re disciplinary measures:  meeting again to-day.



J.	Only substitute for arbitn wd. be indep. enquiry to inform public.



J.G.	Must back Union.  But right thing to do is to make it plain that majority of Union members are not behind the strikers.  N.U.M. wd. do it by a national delegate conference.  Don’t know how T.G.W.U. rules work on a matter of this kind.



Att. G.	Is there any method, under rules, by wh. dockers section can challenge decision of appeal committee?



G.A.I.	Will find out.



H.M.	Surely not – appeal to appeals committee was from Executive.  Can you have a 3rd appeal.

	There is somethg. wrong in Ldn docks.  Dockers don’t know who they are workg. for.  Employers don’t know where they are.



P.M.	Believe the trouble is tht. people in Ldn docks still prefer casual system.



H.M.	What has happened to enquiry wh. M/L. was to make?  [Look into this.]



P.M.		1. Ask Deakin what he can do.

		2. Put troops in to R. Docks &amp; build up fr. that.

		3. Watch developments.

	More genl. discussion about weakness of T.G.W. Union.



Att. G.	P.L.A. Port Em. Cttee will be unofficial – doesn’t displace Dock Labour Bd. etc.

H.M.	Cdn’t P.L.A. give it another name?  e.g. Special Advisory Cttee.



B.	Ministers shd. consider this before it’s appld.

				             [Exit Barnes

				             [Enter K.Y.

5.	    China:  General Policy.



K.Y.	Memo. submd because approved policy twds. China has not gone v. well &amp; want to be assured Cab. don’t wish to change it. – before we go into discn with U.S. officials &amp; Acheson.

	Unfortunate events in China aren’t consequence of our policy &amp; don’t prove our policy wrong.

	Hence recommns in para. 41.



P.M.	Can’t go back on policy of recognising Ch. Comm. Govt.  Tho’ so far it hasn’t profited us.  If we cd. get U.S. to modify their policy, it might help.



R.S.C.	On (d).  Our recognn of Govt. hasn’t helped ease posn of B. subjects.

		They are running up enormous bills.  We shd. make it clear we can’t pay – even if it means their w’drawg. – abandoning interests.



A.V.A.	Didn’t we encourage them to hang on.  



R.S.C.	2 yrs’ ago:  &amp; the new Govt. hadn’t then bn. establd.



A.B.	Disturbing to learn tht. our policy is thwarted by U.S. arms to Nationalists.

		Result:  neither Br. nor U.S. policy can succeed.

	See para. 30 &amp; 40.  We invite a black eye.  We have no sanctions.

		Shd. we not specify a date by wh. Ch. Comm. Govt. must reply to our offer of recognition.



Att. G.	Our failure to admit tht. China’s new Govt. is entitled to seat on Security Council is their best excuse for delaying exchange of dipl. repves (page 14).  A plausible excuse.



A.	Why don’t we admit them to Sec. Council?  



K.Y.	We have told Ch. we favour this.  Only ques. is how to get a majority.  And we are trying to get them one.



A.B.	Under (c) can’t we use argument tht., if they extinguish our 

                   x |	commercial &amp; financial interests in China, we shall have no interest in

                      |  supportg. their claims in U.N. or against U.S.



E.Sh.		i) Go no further than we have gone, at this stage.  Ch. are wily  &amp; will make no concessions to us.

		ii) Sceptical of chance of convertg. U.S. policy.  Doubtful myself wtr. it’s right to liquidate Nationalists.  If we cd. be sure Comms. wdn’t interfere with us in H. Kong &amp; Malaya, all might be well:

		but as we aren’t, much to be said for Nat. &amp; Comms weakening one another.



K.Y.	On x, we will use any levers available.  Doubt if A.B.’s is v. strong one.



A.V.A.	Don’t go beyond these recommns.  Things are deterioratg.  We shall soon want to know who our friends are.  Don’t therefore alienate U.S.



H.McN.	Don’t put any further burdens on Acheson unless we are sure it will persuade Ch. Comm. to give us a better deal.  Don’t press (c) too far.  Prs. explore (e) on A.B.’s lines before pressing (c) any further.



J.	Support A.B.  If no prospect of appeasg. Comms. in China, no sense in antagonising U.S.   F. O. can be authorised to enter into discn &amp; see how they go.



R.S.C.	On other side, we must deal with this Govt. because our many interests in F. East unless we decide to pull out of F/East altogether.



			Agreed.





6.	    China:  Civil Aircraft.



J.G.	Transfer Regs. discovered:  these wd. be pref. to Air Nav. Order.  But satisfd tht. better course wd. be to make O-in-C. wh., while safeguarding tempy custody of aircraft, wd. also make it possible for courts to establ. legal ownership.

	Acheson’s reaction, as shown in Tel. 1243, confirms this recommn.

	Incidental points;

a)	We must carry cost of maintainence. £4.750 intial &amp; £715 p. wk. thereafter.   U.K. Govt. not H. Kong Govt.



R.S.C.	I accept that:  prs. £100.000.

b)	Para. 14.  Claim for damages may be made r. us.

	If so &amp; if successful, U.K. Govt. shd. pay.

i)	U.S. regn of aircraft may have bn. secured by fraud.  Govr. has started enquiry into this, at request of Chinese.  Interests:  Police say prima faci case.  May buy a little more time.

ii)	U.S. interests have appealed r. refusal of injunction.  That is to be heard on 28/4/50.



H.M.	Para. 5.  Why weren’t we told before?  



J.G.	Fault divided betwn. C.O. &amp; H.K.



H.McN.	Not isolated instance.  Diff. to believe H.K. Govt. didn’t suppress knowledge of these Regs.



K.Y.	H. Kong have suppressed all sorts of informn.

		We have bn. trying to find out wtr. aircraft are fit to fly:  never told – until extracted on basis of cost of maintenance.



A.B.	Genl. sitn has clarified.  Can’t stand up to Tel. 1243.

	Favour getting control of whole airport.



J.G.	4.000 Comm-employees i/c.  May mean a fight with them.



R.S.C.	Shd. O-in-C. refer the issue to court vice empowering court to try it.

                  y 1 |		On latter course, neither side might bring it forwd.

                  y 2 |	And, in view of weak attitude of H.K. Ch. Justice, shd. not O-in-C. provide for bringing issue direct to Privy Council.



E.Sh.	We can’t guarantee to m’tain these aircraft.  And if they aren’t m’tained we may get claim for damages.



R.S.C.	We shd. ask U.S. Govt. to give no indemnity v. those.



			(Agreed).



		Agreed. (Ministers to consider y/1).  Trouble with y2 = evidence fr. H. Kong wd. be needed on ques. of fact. 





7.	    Malaya:  Appointment of Chinese Consuls.



J.G.		a) These wd. be centres of intelligence &amp; focus of unrest.

		b)Must win confidence of local Chinese &amp; secure their co-opn

		 in anti-bandit campaign. Many are now sitting on fence.

		Ch. Consuls wd. move them off in wrong direction.  Recognn of Ch. Govt. wd. be regarded then as recognn of Comm. victory in China.

	My concln:  this step wd. make posn in Malaya too diff. for us to hold.  Also v. serious pol. repercussions at home.  Excuse: “which emergency exists in Malaya”.



R.S.C.	There are R. Consuls in Malaya? 



J.G.	Yes. Qua purchase of Malayan exports.



H.M.	Russians are v. obstructive to our dipl. and consular repn in Russia.

		Why aren’t we more aggressive in retaliation.



K.Y.	We have always allowed a Power with whom we are in dipl. relation to have Consuls in countries where major interest.  And they have in Malaya.  *

	But F.O. don’t press this now.  Don’t want to say anythg. at least until after Acheson talks.



J.G.	Agree pro tem.  But want to be able to make a negative statement pretty soon – in particular, before I go to Malaya.



E.Sh.	Welcome K.Y.’s p’ponemt.  All military authies advise tht., if we allow these Consuls in, we might as well chuck our hands in.



			* because of repercussions on us in other parts of the world

			   where we have large Br. colonies.



G.W.	Rumours of admission of Ch. Consuls may put A &amp; N.Z. off giving us some military help.



K.Y.	If it became clear tht. such refusal was only obstacle to full dipl. relns with China, F.O. wd. have to ask for this to be reviewed afresh.
