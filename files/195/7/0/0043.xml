C.M. 47(49).				21st July, 1949.





	1.	Parliament.



H.M.	Business for next week.

	Wed. 27/7. will present Parliament Bill – 3rd time.

	House to sit on Saturday.



W.W.	Monday – 3 line whip:  will sit all night.  But hope to finish before

		Tuesday’s sitting begins.





	2.	Iron and Steel Bill.



G.S.	Provns designed to prevent cos. fr. dissipating assets – retrosp. to 

		various dates.

	Lds. amendmt on main date – will be re-instated in H/L.  Bill then dead.

		Cos. will claim to be free fr. penalties for dissipatg. assets.

	Want therefore to say in H/C. we shall re-introduce Bill &amp; tht. clauses

		(with dates) will remain unaltered.  And will circulate that 

		statement to cos.

	Anticipate King’s Speech:  but think it essential.



H.M.	Can you serve it on cos.?  Threatening what you wd. do in another

		Parlt. not yet elected.  Enough to make statement in H/C.



J.	Is it necessary to make statement at all.  We shan’t be stopped.



A.B.	Morally necessary to make this clear.



A.	Want to say pass under Parlt. Act.



H.M.	May commit you v. Election this autumn.



G.S.	Necessary to inform cos.



P.M.	Enough to tell them about Bill as a whole?



C.E.	Publicity given to statement shd. be enough.

		Letter wd. be thought to take liberties with Parlt. – wh. remains

		free.  Cd be argued tht. it anticipates Parlt’s decision.



J.	Sanction for retrospectn was a statement in Parlt.  No need to go 

		further on this.



A.B.	Wait &amp; see how much publicity is given to H/C. statement.  If enough,

		do no more.

			Agreed:  statement in H/C. and no more, pro tem.



	3.	House of Lords Reform.



A.	Wed:  Reading’s Motion on Women Peers.

	Perth has alleged there was a statement tht. this cd. be arranged if

		H/L. wanted this.

	I can’t find this.  Prefer to say that this can’t be done piecemeal –

		wd. have bn. O.K. if genl. discns on H/L. Reform had bn. carried 

		thro’.



H.M.	Can’t defeat Motion &amp; shdn’t try – in principle.



A.	But asks for immediate legn in this Parlt.



P.M.	Be careful.  King has views and must be consulted.



A.V.A.	Why tinker with &amp; improve hereditary principle wh. we wd. like to

		abolish.



A.B.	Abstract principle of sex equality is supported by us, but its appln

		to H/L. needs thought &amp; cdn’t legislate in this Parlt.



J.	Supported this view.  Say we are in sympathy but it will be for 

		another Parlt. to consider it in detail.



P.M.	But avoid being commd to establishing a second Chamber on a 

		different model.



H.M.	Get Motion amended into a declaratory form – not committing us to

		legn.



P.M.	While avoiding a) approval of hereditary principle  b) commitment

		to a new form of H/Lords.

			                                      [Exit  W.W.

			                                      [Enter  L.S., Jay &amp; H.G.



	4.	Mineral Development.



H.D.	As in memo.

	Choice of minerals to be natd.  We thght. Schedule to Bill covering

		those in para. 4:  but power to amend it by Order if further

		minerals discovered.

	M.D. Commn:  shd. work with D.S.I.R. &amp; Geological Survey. Shd. be

		empowered to work them at will, &amp; to own surface land as well.

	Para. 11(3)-(5) are secondary and can wait pro tem.

		11(3):  G.O.C. shd. submit early report.  My personal view =

			M/F. &amp; P.

		11(4):  v. technical tangle re developmt. charges.  Let offls. 

			consider.

		11(5):  tax changes – w’in t. of r. of Tucker Cttee.

	Westwood Cttee was a good one.  Apart fr. 2 M.P.’s all were non-Party

	scientists.  Gratifying that they took such a good Socialist view.

	N. Yorks. potash deposits.  Not discovered until 1944.  If properly

		developed, we can become self-supporting in potash.  Shows

		how necessary it is to have this properly taken in hand.  Not

		satisfied with pace of progress of I.C.I. &amp; Fisons – must hot

		them up.

	Para. 11(6).



P.M.	Comes in v. handy.  Expert backing for Labour Party view.



H.G.	Don’t mind M. of F. &amp; P. takg. responsibility for Dev. Commn.

		Prodn responsibilities – ques. can be worked out by officials on 

		G.O.C.



H.M.	Do we want to be involved in too many money-losers?  Mineral

		survey cd. spend a lot of money.

	How many more Commns?  Diff. to man them.



A.B.	Or control them?



H.M.	Do we need a Commn.  Cdn’t a Dpt. do this.  It isn’t management –

		only energising.



H.D.	Natn of these minerals won’t cost us anything.

	There are some money-makers – e.g. potash.

	Ty. can see tht. too much money isn’t spent.



H.M.	Content if judgement can be reserved on Commn – until G.O.C. or

		M.G. has examined.



H.D.	Not G.O.C.  Shd. be Ministers – M.G. Cttee.



A.B.	Doubtful about a Commn.

			Agreed:  M.G. Cttee to consider wtr. a Commn

			               Statement (P.Q.) m’while to be confined to 

			               decision to bring under public ownership.  H.G. to

			               consult with H.D. on what shd. be said about

			               tin etc. &amp; other details.			[Exit  L.S.





	5.	Security of Economic &amp; Industrial Information.



A.V.A.	Introduced memo.

	Gave as example brochure of Shell Co. on Stanlow.



P.M.	Horse out of stable.  On gas &amp; electricity, nothing can be concealed.

	O.E.E.C. informn?



A.V.A.	Can’t lessen that v. much.  Mainly on strategic side.



H.M.	Para. 5(b) action wd. disclose where they are.



H.G.	We ought to try.  Can do something.  But don’t push it so far as to

		interfere with technical progress.  Some of recommns on gas &amp;

		electricity might do so.  Wd welcome experts (intelligence)

		consulting directly with Boards.



H.M.	Aerial photography shd. be more thoroughly examined.

			General approval.  Cttee to be appointed.



			                                          [Exit  G.S., H.G.  Enter  McN., B.

	6.	Channel Tunnel.



H.D.	Summarised history.

	Current views.

		Military:     continues to be adverse.

		Political:     no objn, but academic because cdn’t afford 

			           the money now.

			           F.O. official view – short-term gain but long-term 

			           dangers.

		Economic:   R.S.C. cd. find the money if worth while.  But

			           generally, sea &amp; air developmts. are preferable.

			           B/T. adverse.

			           M/T. adverse (prefers train-ferries).

	I concur in general conclusion against Tunnel.

	Less case now &amp; in future than in past – out-dated.



	What shd. be done? or said?  In H/C. or at Strasbourg.



P.M.          x/	Say Govt. have considered and are against it.  But wait until asked.



H.D.	Awkward to have to say it first at Strasbourg.  Wise to have P.Q.



A.B.	Put out a White Paper, with pros &amp; cons.



H.M.	Invites debate.  Don’t like it.



P.M.	“Couldn’t give priority for years – cf. steel alone.”

			Agreed:  Arranged P.Q.  Answer at x/.  And add that in any

			               event it wd. be out of the ques. for ten years.





	7.	Dock Strike.



P.M.	V. awkward sitn on Tues. p.m. when confronted with Bd.’s statement,

		in wh. return to work &amp; jeopardising scheme were jeopardised.

		Said we might have brought all the men out.  All T.U. opinion

		was to that effect.

	Felt it necessary to dissociate Govt. from this.



C.E.	Reported his interview with Ammon on 20/7.  Have sent aide-memoire

		to A.

	Had expected Ammon to be truculent – as on 19/7.  But he was 

		compliant.



P.M.	On 19/7 Ammon was asserting independence of Board.

	They had told P. Em. Cttee they wanted to sack all strikers.  P.E. Cttee

		had told them not do that - &amp; assumed they wd. come back with

		another draft.



G.A.I.	Govt. action has raised their stock with the men – at expense of Bd.



C.E.	E. India Dock mtg. – voted this a.m. in favour of returning to work.



H.D.	Ammon’s statement about “the Govt.”  Isn’t he a member of the

		Govt.?



H.M.	Who apptd him to the Board.



G.A.I.	I did.  The Bd. recommended his re-appointmt for another year.



H.M.	Shd. a member of the Govt. have been apptd to this Board.



P.M.	This point was considered at the time.

	He will have to resign from the Govt.



B.	Since last-night’s mtg. Ammon has made further statements 

		disagreeing with Govt.  “I have refused to give way.”

		Believe something must now be said in H/C. to clear it up.



C.E.	Muddled Q. &amp; A. in H/C.  Shd. I answer in future?



A.B.	After y’day it wd. denigrate M/L.



B.	If any change, I shd. answer for P. Em. Cttee.



N.B.	A.’s condn is evidently such that he shd. not continue in so important

		a posn of Chairman of Board.



B.	Statement tht,. P.E. Cttee haven’t contacted Bd. is ludicrously untrue.





		8.	Bechuanaland Protectorate.  Chieftainship of Bamangwato 

			Tribe.



N.B.	As in memo.

	Serious repercussions in S. Africa &amp; S. Rhodesia.

		Huggins has declared v. recogn of Seretze.

		Forsyth has said Malan is worried at move by S. Afr.

		Republicans.

		Egeland has said wd. be a disaster.  Havenga also.

	Have taken advice, from all quarters.

	Native opinion is v. Seretze – tho’ might swing if we declined to

		recognise.

	All are agreed – Ruth Wms cdn’t live there.

	Early recognition is ruled out.

	Immedte order of judicial enquiry wd. calm S. African opinion.

		But I wd. prefer to get him back &amp; get him to abdicate.



C.J.	Don’t like this.  We shd. be accused of yielding to European 

		influences in S. Africa.

	Wd prefer to have enquiry at once.  Believe report wd. enable us to

		decide he shdn’t be Chief.

	Get ques. away from racial ques. on to best future govt. of territory.

	Even if enquiry gave wrong result, we cd. give decision still.

	Bad reaction in African opinion &amp; liberal opinion here if we talk 

		him into abdication.

	This is what we do in C.O. practice.  If wrong person is put fwd. as

		Chief.



P.M.	What is ratio decidendi for judicial Cttee.



N.B.	Read t. or r. proposed by Baring.  Wtr. procedure was correct:  wtr.

		Seretze is fit &amp; proper person to be Chief, in view of his

		marriage.



H.M.	Easy.  Clear that he shouldn’t be Chief.



A.B.	Not so easy.  Even if proved tht. mtg. was properly held, S. African

		opinion wdn’t be placated.

	Isn’t the Regent the real villain?

	Support C.J.  Fatal for us to bribe him off because racial prejudices

		of S. Afr.



N.B.	Not safe to expect another enquiry to go against Seretze.  V. awkward

		if they find for him – to flout S. Africa.



McN.	Dangerous to talk with Seretze.

	He or she are bound to be nobbled by Press.

	Support C.J. proposal.



A.	If this woman goes out, S. Afr. will apply for incorpn of Protectorates

		in Union.

	Risky to try to talk him into Abdication.

	Prefer enquiry, on difft. t. of r.  More general – to report generally on

		circumstances.  Avoid ques. wtr. properly elected.  For might be

		found he was.  Don’t call it a judicial enquiry.



A.B.	I want to include a technicality so as to avoid having to face the 

		embarrassing general question.

	Or (amending) must be such as will enable Commn to discuss matters

		other than mixed marriage.

	What is at issue is good government of Bechuanaland.



P.M.	Why hurry?

	Say Tsekedi cd. carry on pro tem.  Say you are going to have a 

		judicial enquiry.  Then public opinion can crystallise.  And 

		Seretze may come home suo motu.

	T. of r. to be settled with C.O., L.P.S. &amp; Ld Chanc.
