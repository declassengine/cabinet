C.M. 72 (49)					15th December, 1949



1.	    Parliament.

			                                                      [Serv. Ministers &amp; C.O.S.



P.M.	Prorogn Friday.  Ministers shd. attend.  Parlt. Bill.



J.	Shd. be over by 12 noon.



	Justices of Peace Bill.



J.	Schuster is causing trouble.



C.E.	Hewelin is expected to fix it.

	Parliament Square Bill.



J.	Simon is likely to cause trouble.





2.	    Defence Estimates.  1950/51.



P.M.	Summd earlier processes of discussion.

	£780 + proviso re Supplementaries.  Diffy because new equipmt.  War stocks becomg. exhausted.  Earlier years – appropns in aid fr. sales of surpluses.

		On both grds. new expenditure inevitable.



A.V.A.	Emphasise – 

a)	V. stringent examn over more than 12 months.  Plan behind these figures is 3-Service plan, for first time.  With reducg. man-power &amp; money, we have had to accept grt. risks.  With constant revision &amp; scrutiny we have got to greatest poss. economy in relation to commitments.



A.	P.2. VI b) R.A.F. cdn’t fight for more than 1 month.  P.21, para.2. “R.A.F. wd. be shop-window Force.”  Shd. we allow any expenditure to rank before effective fighter Force?



P.M.	Cold war requires far-flung Forces abroad – heavy Army expenditure.

		Minimum expre on Navy.  R.A.F. potential is m’tained, but can’t have larger front-line Force in being – high cost of aircraft.



A.V.A.	Keeping potential going only on basis of foreign sales.  Cd. use whole output.  But cost wd. be more than we cd. bear.

		Heavy cost of man-power in present condns.  Fighter costs many times more than pre-war.



A.H.	Air Force is v. expensive – much more so than others.  Fighters costs £30.000 (cpd. with £8.000 or so).  4 engine Jet bomber might cost ½ million.

A.B.	Want more integrated picture – with Allied contns taken into a/c.

		Recognise can’t have it yet.

	If in Opposn I had access to this memo. - &amp; asked what contn Allies wd. make after the one month had exhausted our fighter strength.  “We have arranged for only a month’s defence.”



P.M.	Clear U.K. cdn’t match itself v. Russian.

	Trying to build up W. Union.  Trying to swing in U.S.  But haven’t yet got to stage of fully co-ordinated plan.

	Danger is:  lose posns on perimeter, if we concentrate unduly on defence of U.K.  We are holding bigger responsibility than others.



A.V.A.	Now makg. definite progress.  1.000 m $ of equipmt. fr. U.S.A. is now coming to W. Europe.

	Deterrent value of Atlantic Pact.  Have now got agreemt. on strategic concept &amp; beginning with prodn Cttee.



A.B.	I want Allied point + further fighter reserves written into memo.



E.B.	Agree.  But don’t water this down too much.  I shall have to raise at Colombo ques. of Dom Contn



R.S.C.	Add para. in P.M.’s covering note.



P.M.	There is much of this on p. 13.  Point it up in covering note.



C.A.S.		a) must face ques. tht. we can’t fight w’out warning period.  

					                 [Agreed

		Applies, not only to fighters, but throughout.

b)	Our line: 1st object to prevent war.  Emphasis therefore on shop-window.

	This gives us doubling of fighter + increase bomber front-  	line at expense of reserves.

c)	Takes longer to train men than to build aircraft.  If you must choose it pays better to get on with training of men.  If prodn is flowg. &amp; there is warning period (18 months) we can step up supplies.



C.E.	This means much more C.D. prepn.



P.M.	No.  All w. democracies cd. be broken by enticing them into spending too much in preparation.



C.E.	There is a golden mean.

	In country feeling tht. U.K. are spending more on Defence per capita than our Allies.  A.V.A. tells me tht. U.S. are spendg. more per head of popn than we are.  Can we make that clear:   is it safe to do so?

A.B.	Passive Defence.  We shd. avoid any overt act wh. wd. handicap A.V.A. and E.B. in dealing with Allies.



E.B.	Yes:  must move twds. European Defence Budget.

	Getting out of our Defence Estimates extraneous points like adminn of occupied territory.



A.W.	Suggn for economy.  Cd. aircraft industry &amp; R.A.F. be so linked that training in one can be useful in the other.  As has bn. done in research.



A.V.A.	Is being done as far as possible.



J.	Leakage of this memo.  V. explosive.   Can all copies be recovered?



			Agreed:  Estimates approved.

			               P.M. to re-write covering memo.

			               Recover all copies of paper.

				

                                                                                                [Exit Serv. Min. &amp; C.O.S. 

			                                                      [Enter Att. Gen. H.G.

3.	    Electricity Strike.



C.E.	Statement.  



G.A.I.	Present situation.



P.M.	Act of 1875 &amp; Stat Order.  Prosecution is a matter for Att. Genl.

		But wants to know wtr. there wd. be risk of extension.



G.A.I.	Doubtful about wisdom

a)	Never bn. done before.

b)	Practical diffy. of avoiding appearance of victimisation.

	Advise followg. precedent of miners – civil action for damages:  by B.E.A.

		Token case – against all.



P.M.	Wd. criminal procdgs. lead to extension of strike.



G.A.I.	Yes.



Att.G.	If strike has ended, I wdn’t in any event prosecute.

	But I believe tht. if recurrence of trouble in power stations, we shd. have to operate the 1875 Act.

	Civil procdgs. = for B.E.A.



E.B.	Crim. procdgs. always a boomerang – except in mining.

	Can make martyrs of them.





A.B.	No discipline in socd indies unless Bds. do sue for damages.  Nor wd. you hold the miners.



H.G.	Not over all trouble in power stations yet.

	Talked to Citrine.  B.E.A. don’t want to proceed – 2.700 people to be proceeded against.  They wdn’t mind action under 1875 Act, but Cab. are r. that.  Alternative:  refusing to take ringleaders back.  They expect that wd. cause gt. trouble.  And M/L. advised them not to use this threat.



P.M.	Nos. alone are no answer.  Just as great in mines cases.



E.B.	You must act on a plan.  Daren’t risk leaving it to various chairmen.

		Don’t tell them what to do. (!)



T.W.	3 Bds. under M/F &amp; P.  Must be some uniformity betwn. them.

		Can’t go on suing for damages r. miners &amp; not r. others.



H.G.	Procedgs. aren’t automatic.  Cases taken by Divl Offrs. at discretion.



A.B.	Must have a policy.  Must at least say tht. in future cases there will be a risk of procdgs.



H.G.	B.E.A. might give a warning.  Procdgs + lose of emplt.

	

			Minister to use his discretion

			in the light of Cabinet’s discussion.

					[Exit Att.G. 



4.	    Recognition of Communist Govt. in China.



E.B.	This battle was lost at Yalta – when Port Arthur ceded to Russia.

		Confirmed later at Moscow mtg. with Byrnes &amp; Molotov.  And I didn’t sign that agreement because I foresaw it wd. be the end of China.

	Tried to keep Powers together on this.  Kept in touch with India, particularly.

	Tried to hold it until Colombo.  Don’t now think we can.  Believe it maybe 29 or 30 Dec.  Not before 28 Dec. – for I told Dutch we wd. try to hold this until transfer of power in N.E.I.

		Dutch don’t want to recogn. China for Indonesia – want it delayed.

	Another trouble = France.  Trying to get France to transfer Bo Dai fr. there C.O. to their F.O.  For India cdn’t recognise a “Colonial” posn.

	Scandinavia will follow us.  Canada will.  Australia may.

	In U.S.  Republicans thinks State Dept. have muddled the China ques.

		U.S. Govt. may be offended.  But believe storm will soon pass.

		Anyhow I can’t wait for State Dpt. pique to pass away.

	China:  not wholly wedded to Moscow.  It’s still China.

	Singapore Confce unanimously recommended recognn not later than Jan 1st 1950.



N.B.	Bajpai spoke to me on Sunday re China.  Not a satellite revolution from Moscow.  But a national revolution like Russia in 1917.

	Pre-occupied with difficulty in Security Council because Chinese Chairmanship.

	He added, however, tht. if we delayed date India wd. understand.

	Pakistan &amp; Ceylon wd. wait for Colombo.  S. Afr. don’t want to be in first batch.  Can. wd. wait until Colombo.

	Austr. &amp; N.Z. new Govts. mght make it a grievance if we didn’t wait for Colombo.



J.	Formosa.

	Suppose Nat. Govt. wd. be recognised as authy in Formosa.



P.M.	No:  for it’s legally Japan.



E.B.	We shall reserve our posn until sovereignty of Formosa is determined.



C.J.	Dec. 29 wd. be best date for C.O. – to key up propaganda.



N.B.	Indo-China.  Bajpai told me French Offls. was being v. re-actionary on the spot – much more than is Govt.  If they wd. transfer terries to India, Govt/India wd. be more helpful &amp; wd. even recognise Bo Dai.



C.E.	1) Shall allow Chinese Amb. to stay in U.K., with some of his staff.

	2) Some Chinese visitors to U.K. may decline to return to China.

		Most have little to fear.

	3) Want to know for how long new Govt. will recognise ppts. etc., issued by previous Govt.



R.S.C.	Take care of ancient regime members coming to U.K.



A.V.A.	Any U.S. answer to our request not to go on supplying arms to Chinese Nationalists.



E.B.	No.

					[Enter W.P.



5.	    Staff Associations in Post Office.



W.P.	As in memo.



G.A.I.	Support course c)



A.B.	So do I.  Must avoid recognising break-away Unions.

		40% formula is too tight.

		P.O. Unions have bn. friendly to Labour Party.

	Approved:  course (3). Down with break-away Unions &amp;

			                   Splinter parties.

				               	[Exit W.P.



6.	    Parliament Square Bill.



A.	Simon’s point about Buxton Fountain.

	Told by M/W. repves in box tht. Parlt. cd. approve erection outside Square.

	Then in H/C. M/W. turned it back.

	Simon will raise it again - &amp; may destroy the Bill.



Att. G.	Don’t know basis of M/W. action.

	We accepted affirm. resoln in H/Lords.  It was a breach of faith to put back negative resoln in H/Commons.



G.A.I.	Told in H/C. that this wd. mean loss of Bill.



Att.G.	Must find a way of putting it back as H/L. lift it.



H.D.	Is it certain Bill won’t be lost on carriage-way amendment.



A.	They won’t insist…

		P.M. sent for M/Works.



C. K.	The amendmt. was put on Paper by Parly. Counsel before I knew.

		For they argue it’s only way of conformg. to Statutory Instruments Act.	

		My Under-Secretary said Simon’s letter was acceptable to J. &amp; A.



A.	Never heard of this letter.  



J.	I said it was for A.



P.M.	Govt. accepted affirmve resoln in H/L.



A.B.	Yes:  but consultns with Stat. Inst. Cttee.  We have bn. guided by them.

		H/L. departed fr. this.  Govt. made an unreasonable concession in order to get the Bill.  Parly. Secretary told M/W. that this wd. be worn by H/Lords.



C.K.	Thght. inadequate attentn given in H/L. on basis of ms. amendments.



P.M.	Often have to sacrifice principle to get the Bill.



C.K.	No discn in H/L. on aff. or neg. procedure – incldg. “Parly. approval”.



P.M.	But fact remains tht. amendmt. was accepted in H/L. in this form.



A.	Aff. resoln is the price we pay for the Bill.



W.W.	Parlt. retains control, even under negative resoln.

		Tories all said this was a better form – divided only on point that Govt. changed their mind.  V. awkward for us to change our minds again – we shall have to get our people to vote in opposite sense.



C.K.	Parly Counsel weren’t consulted before amendmt accepted in H/L.



A.B.	What H/L. want is opportunity for discussg. this before Fountain is put elsewhere.  Cd. M/W. give assurance tht. Reqn will be expd as comg. into operation on a later date &amp; op. for Parly discn m’while.



J.	No:  H/L. debate will take form merely tht. Govt. agreed &amp; must stand by its Parly bargain.  They aren’t concerned with the substance.



H.D.	Deplorable to lose the Bill on a/c of this bungle.
