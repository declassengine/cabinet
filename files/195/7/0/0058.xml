C.M. 64(49).				7th November, 1949.



	1.	Christmas Food.	[Enter  J.S.



J.S.	Announce Mon. next.

	Argentine:  no sign of interruptn of meat shipments.  None in ‘49

		anyhow.



R.S.C.	Still opposed to meat bonus.  Not out of Argentine wood.  Can’t

		dissipate so much fr. stock – 10% of our (large) stock.

		Posn no better than when Cab. discussed earlier.

	Sugar diff. because just cut p’mme.  And this means 9.000 t. off the

		cut.  Because you reduce stocks by that amount.



J.S.	It’s in hands of sweet manufrs.  We won’t give any more fr. stocks.



R.S.C.	V. well.



J.S.	Meat:  wd. mean holdg. stocks in refrig. ships.  V. costly.

	This wd. bring stocks to 235.000 t. as cpd. with target of 200.000 t.

	Cold stores are all full (incldg. Govt. built wartime stores).



H.M.	Support R.S.C. on meat.  Wd. look odd in reln to Argentine discns.



H.W.	My advisers think bonus will help us in Argentine talks.



T.W.	P.Q.’s about using ships for storage.  Will be followed up.  We may be

		made to look stupid.



A.B.	Can defend keeping stocks to threaten Argentine.



H.D.	A good batch even without the meat.



R.S.C.	Wd cost £400.000 in subsidy.



G.T.	Will any meat go bad?



J.S.	No.  Not like bacon.



R.S.C.	Give meat bonus later if Argentine talks justify it.

			Agreed:  subject to deletion of meat.

			               don’t make any secret of meat stocks.



		                                                    [Exit  J.S.  Enter  C.M., Att.Gen.



	2.	India:  Consequential Provisions Bill.



A.	Want authority to discuss with Bajpai.



P.M.	Confine Cab. discns to general line.

	We shd. insist on things that matter, not stick on detail.

		E.g. don’t insist on franchise, but do stick out for company

		treatment.



Att.G.	Regret necessity for legn.  Will expose our play on words.  Subtlety

		of Cl. 1.

	Wd. have preferred Cl. 2 alone.  Suppose Cl. 1 found inevitable.



R.S.C.	Cdn’t we see how things turn out.



J.	Sympathise.  Explore diffies with Bajpai.

			Agreed:  Explore with Bajpai minimum line of legn.





	3.	India:  Liability to Military Service.



A.	As in memo.  Para. 13.



G.A.I.	Support para. 13.



P.M.	Put it as a corollary to the privileges.  Leave oblign tho’ in practice it

		won’t be enforced.



Att.G.	In international law I doubt if we cd. justify conscriptg. Comm.

		citizens.  Because relation of Comm. countries inter se is not

		distinguishable from that of foreign countries.



H.D.	Forget to call them up.



G.A.I.	Cd. do so – unless an Irishman challenged us.



A.B.	Is it so easy?  What about doctors?  Refraing. fr. callg. up Indians

		wd. cause diffies with the other doctors.

			Memo. approved.

			No publicity.





	4.	Title and Status of High Commissioners.



P.M.	Diffies.	a)  King accreditg. to himself.

			b)  Foreign-ness:  especially in N.Z. feeling is strong.



R.S.C.	“Commonwealth Ambassador”?



P.M.	“Ambassador &amp; High Commissioner”?



J.	In Oct. ’48 Nehru opposed “Ambassador”.







Att.G.	Immunity.  Propose declaratory legislation.

	“Ambassador” in Dublin means nothg. either way because not in

		Commonwealth.



H.M.	Can’t we delay.



R.S.C.	Let’s have one rule for all.

			Agreed:      Immunity as proposed.

			                { P.M. personal message to P.M.’s – suggestg

			                { “Comm. Ambassador”.

			                { First, however, P.M. to discuss with Nehru.

			                { Also, P.M. to mention to the King.



C.J.	Indian repves in Colonies.



P.M.	Consular status only.

				[Exit  C.M. &amp; Att. Gen.





	5.	Salaries in N. Health Service.



A.B.	Salaries of Town Clerks etc.

	Assocns have recommended, at my instance, that these new scales shd.

		not be put into operation.



	Nurses etc.



A.B.           x/	I wanted to call attn of Wh. Council to W. Paper.  But M/L. &amp; A.W.

		prefer tht. this shd. be done by “management side” of Wh. 

		Council.

	But six cases where we cdn’t avoid going fwd.

		i) 	Mental hospitals &amp; sanatoria.  Award must be announced.

		iii)	Cd. call attentn to R.S.C. statement tht. full differentials

			      needn’t be granted at this time.

		iv)	Adjustments in priority dental service salaries.

	In summary, carry on where we are half-way thro’.



P.M.	Service Dpts. want to have same liberty, under iii. &amp; iv., for Service

		doctors &amp; dentists.



A.W.	This is not ques. of wage increases.  We are half-way thro’ fixing

                   y/		salaries for a new Service &amp; we must finish the job.

	On x/, my view is tht. direct interventn wd. differentiate this from

		other arbitration, &amp; wd. give appearance tht. govt. are 

		directly fixing wages.



R.S.C.	Generality iii) – iv)  Dpts. shd. come to Ty. in normal way.



A.B.	Agreed.



R.S.C.	On C. Serv. claims Ty. line is to give nothing &amp; let all go to 

		arbitration.

		Clerical claim has bn. turned down.  We can hope for results

		fr. arbitn.

	Agree to i) and ii) as things done &amp; committed.  Remainder shd.

		proceed in ordinary course by reference to Treasury.



G.A.I.	On x/ I support A.W.

	Wd. be more consistent with decision on Prison Officers’ pay.

	Emphasise y/.

	Arbitrators generally are havg. regard to economic condns.



G.T.	Even completing a process half-way thro’ may create fresh

	repercussions.





	6.	Wages Policy.



R.S.C.	Spoke Tewson this a.m.  Trying to stop automatic link increases.

		Asked them not to take final decns w’out spkg. to Ministers.

		Said he wd. do his best.

	V. diff.  If the sliding-scale proposal is rejected, no other claims

		can be held.



G.A.I.	Argument the other side.  Bldg. trade – review each Feb. &amp; in last

		2 yrs. 1/10 rise each time.  3/8 total for 2 yrs.  W’out it, they 

		wd. have made a bigger claim &amp; got it.  This therefore cheaper.

	Must, however, try to stand up to this.



R.S.C.	Steel is most diff. case for T.U.C.
