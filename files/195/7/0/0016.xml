C.M. 16(49)							28th February 1949



		1.	Cabinet Committees.	       [Enter B., J.S., G.R.S., H.G., C.W.K.



P.M.	No mention to be made of Cab. Cttees )  Some Junior Minister told 

	Junior Ministers to be told.		  )  T.U.C. of existence of Jay

						      Cttee.



		2.	Civil Servants : Membership of L.A.’s.



H.M.	Earlier decision.

	Two points raised.  a)  Docs. rule apply to Aldermen?         Agreed yes.

			        b)  Co-opn to Cttees.  Cd. be allowed.

			        c)  Some are already members of l.a.’s – allowed 			     to run pre-war.  Propose to allow them to 				     continue for same l.a. until defeated. 



P.M.	c) isn’t logical.



H.M.	But shall be said Tory Minister allowed them to stand : Labour Minister removing them.  May be trouble.



	(c) approved.





		3.	Defence : Inducements for Recruiting.



A.V.A.	What can we say in debate about incentives to regular recruiting?

	Something about m. quarters? Related to housing p’mme.



A.B.	Don’t go on speaking of “shortage of houses”.  “Demand for more houses”.

	Diffy = demand for labour in particular areas.  Will collaborate with M/D. in this.  Welcome general statement – tanks equally with miners : farm workers because in particular places that need arises.





		4.	Economic Survey for 1949.



R.S.C.	Expld earlier scrutinies by Prod. Cttee.



P.M.	Discretion to R.S.C. to make drafting changes.



A.	Welcomed addl. para. on Canada.



	Man Power “Targets”.



R.S.C.	Ques. of presentn – diffce only 1% of labour force, in mining industry.

	My compromise plan is on p. 2 of memo.

	Incentive or requirement target.

	Ques. is wthr. 788 in Galley 25 shdn’t be 795 : “forecast” omitted : and explann given as in memo.  That shd. avoid criticism of “failing to attain target”.



G.A.I.	We see no chance of getting 795.  We shall get the criticism therefore.

	Point is : N.C.B. say they don’t require these men : diffy in getting them to take E.V.W.’s.



H.G.	N.C.B. don’t want Irish labour in certain Divns – and diffy. in absorbing f. labour.

	That doesn’t = “don’t need the men”.

	I am content with R.S.C.’s words.

	We can’t dispute industry’s figure of requirements.



G.A.I.	Do Cab. think R.S.C.’s formula will preserve us fr. criticism – incldg. criticism fr. U.S.A.



R.S.C.	No anxiety re U.S.A.  Finletter will understand.

	Must give a figure.  The industry has said what it needs.  Can’t go behind that.



H.G.	Marginal figure anyway.  Criticism wdn’t be serious.

	Agreed : as in R.S.C. formula.



P.M.	Does N. Govt Service include G.P.O.?



R.S.C.	Yes. 



P.M.  	Show them separately?  with transport and communns.



R.S.C.	Explann is in para. 92.

	Transferring it to transport wd. look like faking.



	Agreed : consider entering G.P.O. separately.



C.J.	Final text omits various references to contribns from Colonies.



R.S.C.	Prepared to include para. recently suggested by C.O.



C.J.	Col. contns to b/payments omitted. Para. 68.  Also footnotes to Tables.



R.S.C.	Don’t want to isolate Colonies because of diffies in U.S.  E.C.A. trying to get sterling Area accepted as a unit.



	General Run-over the Text.



	Part I : II : no comments.



R.S.C.	Part IV.  Read new para. on objectives.



H.M.   	a)  Is it right to abandon use of expn “targets”.

	     Was a good incentive to industries.

	     Not a bad thing to have criticism for failing to reach them.



R.S.C.	Prod. Cttee agreed it wd. be a mistake because of diffies of arriving at right figures.



H.M.   	b)  Para. 128. Cttee on Industrial Productivity shd. be mentioned.   

		Agreed.



N.B.   	c)  Grateful for para. 77 in re-print.  Meets main Canadian point.

Can. always bring in “multi-lateral trade” as long-term objectives.    Cd. a reference to that be brought in?



	Paras. 78-9. “Attack” on N. American market won’t read well in Canada.

	Re-phrase.  



R.S.C. 	Don’t think they will mind.  That is what they want to hear.



J.S.	“Get back to normal trading methods”.  “Normal pattern of world trade” instead.   Agreed.





		5.	Wage Movements in 1948.



G.A.I.	When memo. circulated I was in mood of moderate optimism.  Since then, a further cycle seems to have started.

	White Paper has bn. useful because prayed in aid by both sides in negotn.

	Shd. results be published?  Pro and con.  Might give impn tht. original W. Paper has served its purpose – is all over now.

	Little prodn lost by disputes.  Fewer and quicker settled. T.U. officials have come in earlier and recourse had more quickly to conciliation machinery.

	Evce of Comm. influences – but offset now by strong line taken by T.U. v. it.

	Cost/living now constantly comes up.  A slight reduction wd. be v. helpful in holding wage claims.

	New development due to last award to agricultural workers – as explained in later memo.



R.S.C.	V. serious situation.

	Agric. is bad enough.  Retail trade worse.  This is the industry fr. which we want to keep people.  Puts pull in wrong direction.

	Passenger transport : may mean consequentials in all other industries when inconvenient times covered by shift system.  Textile : anxious to keep down costs.



	No publn – wd. draw attention to those who have got away with it and provoke other demands.

	But new appeal for restraint wd. help – from P.M.  And enlist aid of T.U.’s.



A.V.A.	These minima for retail trade are lower than some T.U.’s have already.

	Diff. therefore to resist.  Will be said you are opposing efforts to stop undercutting of T.U. rates.



B.	Concerned – as R.S.C. is.  Generally.  But specially by Sat. pm. award.

	That must affect all transport work which has to go on, by shifts, over week-end.

	Bad that, in limited field, we shd. get landed by too hasty a decn.



T.W.	Shd. we not oppose movement to get old relativities with agriculture preserved.  Quoted fr. White Paper.

	In last 2 yrs. large nos. fr. labour imported into agric. W.L.A. controls.

	All these necessary to fulfil p’mme.

	Agric hours are longer than roadmen’s and other rural occupns.  Agric. hasn’t out-stepped the rest.



A.B.	Not comparable : for roadmen are on minimum and few farm workers are.

	Ag. Workers Union insist tht. at tribunal all discn. shd. be on minimum.

	But when award is made it goes on all rates.  And v. few are on minimum – so argument is rural.



A.W.	This inflation, if it continues, will destroy all our work on O.A.P., N.H. etc.

	Cd. R.S.C. persuade our people tht. they must stop this – no demands for more wage increases.  Attack prices instead.



G.A.I.	Retail change – agreed with employers to bring defaulting employers into line.



R.S.C.	But wdn’t cost £20 m.  That means all will get the increase – as happened with agric. award, which is to cost £10 m.  Once award is made, it goes on to all wages.



A.V.A.	Cdn’t resist Union pressure for its appln. up to managers.



A.B.	Emerges therefore that argument v. minimum is unreal.



E.B.	Agric : Control Order is still on.  Can you deny higher wages to men who aren’t free to seek higher pay in another industry.



R.S.C.	If this goes on, inflation will get out of hand.



H.M.	Transport : Sat pm.’s.  Terrington’s award, which condemning principle of extra pay for inconvenient times, concedes it in this case.  Lets down Transport Executive, after their firm stand.

	N.U.R., led by near Communist, havg. failed in big appln are now making another.  And will certainly go for a Sat. award.

	M/L. optimisim.  Typical concln. of earlier memo.  Then w’in a few days comes 2nd memo and not all facts are new.

	Are individual Unions paying same regard on T.U.C. to W. Paper policy?

	Cdn’t P.M. take a firm line?



P.M.	As soon as I do, our back benchers, will say “what about wages”?



R.S.C.	We have in fact held profits much better than wages.



H.M.	Hope all Ministers will support a public appeal for restraint.



G.A.I.          x/	Suggest some Ministers shd. meet members of T.U.C. Genl. Council and discuss posn. with them – w’out cut and dried decision in advance.

	May be some disposn. to agree to a new wages policy.



A.W.	Can we get idea of money value of wage increases made compd. with increased production.  To show it’s going too far.

	eg. R.S.C.’s memo. analysing disposal of profits.  Bring up to date and publicise.  Comms. exploit misunderstandings about profits.



P.M.	How to handle this?  Not T.U.C. alone.  non Executives – and even members.



R.S.C.	T.U.C. have tried hard to give a lead.  Mustn’t by-pass them.  Favour x/.

	Then consider next step.

	Will prepare draft statement by P.M. – on anniversary of W. Paper – as basis for discn. with T.U.C.

	Will get out a memo. on profits, as suggested.



A.B.	If relativities have now bn. adjusted, why not anchor wages to c/living?

	So as to ensure that wages will fall, if prices fall.

	A stabiliser factor if we are at a turning point.



E.B.	When c/living begins to fall, T.U.’s will demand stabilisation.  They won’t follow the index down.

	In general, you can’t have your cake and eat it.  You can have State reguln. of wages throughout (over my dead body).  Or, you must have some method of avoiding strikes.  I invented these courts – in 1940 – and you had better examine and weight their record of achievement before you condemn them.



	A new approach to T.U.’s.  Can you give any indicn. of a future fall in price levels?  If you can, sell them the idea of stability – they will rise to that.  Let R.S.C. turn C.E.P.S. on to that.



A.B.	Remember – most important element in price is wages.



R.S.C.	Put £20 m. on to retail distn. and it must lead to increased prices.

	As agric. wage increase had to go on to prices.



C.E.	Oaksey Cttee. Rpt. will be in w’in 3 wks.  Bound to recommend substantial increases for rank and file.  Ch.C’s increase was delayed because of White Paper.

	Shd. have v. gt. diffy in withholding increases from rank and file.



G.T.	Go for a wages stop on a voluntary basis.



	Agreed: G.A.I. to submit memo to E.P. Cttee., in light of this discussion, with a view to subsequent discussn with T.U.C.



							[Exit G.R.S., C.W.K., J.S.



		6.	Petrol Rationing.



H.G.	As in memo. Plus	a)   Can’t do anything before Election, if you 			      don’t do it now.  Left to next spring. wd. 				be too obvious.



				b)  Bonus via permanent increase because 				      avoids commitment.  Don’t want to have 				to reduce a ration.



	Advantages – mainly political.



E.B.	Timing.  In reln to approach for U.S. assistance in stock-piling oil.

	Also diffies. in U.S. because of Mayhew’s speech.

	Cd. this be deferred for 2 months?  eg. mid/May and say nil m’while.



T.W.	And think of enormous civil consumption in U.S.



R.S.C.	Most Eur. countries are using more than we.

	And, margin, means dollar petrol.



A.	Declining to spend money on Can. bacon. 



R.S.C.  	Canada won’t raise it.



N.B.	Even India wdn’t.  But awkward to announce it now.



H.G.	Wait until May.  I wd. rather say “no” in reply to P.Q.’s and spring it as a surprise.

H.M.	Must learn to evade Questioners.



H.G.	Real diffy. is holidays – and desire to plan ahead.



	Adjourn discussion for one week.
