				[Exit  A.H. &amp; C.A.S.

				[Enter  Solr. Genl.

	2.	Divorce Laws.



P.M.	What answer to P.Q.?



H.M.	We decided to offer only to defeat amendment.

	Must now consider on merits.

		Wd they present unanimous report?

		Won’t it embarrass the Govt. to whom it does report?  Believe

		we shall be sorry we started it.



J.	P.M.’s statement of 18/1.

	Have always wanted to avoid report near an Election.

	Agitatn mainly on point of 7 years’ separation.



H.M.	If that’s only issue – v. gt. risk of encouraging desertion.



J.	There is also divorced wife’s sister.



A.B.	Some support for enquiry.

	But problem will be composn of Commn.  Shd. R.C.’s be on or not?

                   x/	Say:  not a matter for last year of a Parlt.



T.W.	Wiser to avoid commitment even before Election.  Stonewall.



C.E.	Bound to be asked intentns if Commn apptd.



A.W.	Against having enquiry.



H.D.	Say “No, Sir” – w’out using argument at x/.

			Agreed:  Refuse appointmt of Commn.





	3.	Royal Commission on Press.



H.M.	Recommend acceptce of Report.

	No time for the legn recommended – in this Parlt.

		Shd. have to discuss with co-op. Union before procdg. with 

		recommn about Friendly Societies.  Reg. Genl’s views.

	Urge Press to appoint Press council – with lay members.



J.	Don’t like bringing Judges into these appointmts – on verge of 

		politics.



H.M.	Wd prefer Ld Chancellor.



E.B.	Dislike Judges recommn.



J.	I wd. prefer that, too.



H.M.	Diff. for govt. to object.

	Debate:  probably on Friday next.



A.B.	Two days – to give Labour Party chance of a row.



P.M.	One day wd. be ample.  H.M. shd. be Govt. spokesman.



Solr. G.	Monopolies Act.  Amendmt wd. be requd.  But not clear fr. report what

		the Commn wanted Monopolies Commn to be able to do.



E.B.	Restn of sale by radius was forced on newspp. by Newsvendors’ Fedn.

		Be careful of kicking the Press for that.

			Memo. approved.





	4.	  Anglo-Norwegian Fishery Dispute.



E.B.	Modus vivendi proposed by them is unacceptable.

	Don’t think they will join in bi-lateral appln to Court.  Give them until

		30/7:  then go unilaterally.

	M’while modus vivendi:  compromise betwn. Red and Blue Line.



T.W.	Agree.

	Norw. Govt. are afraid of communists in n. Norway.



A.V.A.	Wd this appln to Court have effect of raising ques. of Fishery Agreemts.

		throughout the world?



E.B.	No.

			Memo. approved.





	5.	  Chancellor of Exchequer.



P.M.	Had hoped to tell Cab. to-day &amp; announce in H/C. this p.m.

	Had to put it out y’day because leak had started.

	I will take charge of Ty. business – with help of B/T.  Important

		ques. to Cab.



H.M.	Sympathy &amp; good wishes.

											[Enter  B.

	6.	    National Dock Labour Board.



B.	Sorry M/L. thght he shd. have bn. consulted.  Em. Cttee asked me to

		put my views to Cab.

	Believe Bd. has undermined relations &amp; discipline.

	Main cause of unrest – failure of T. &amp; G.W. Union to apply discipline.

	I suffer the consequences.

	Twice in 12 months forced to use Em. Powers Act.  Proves there is 

		weakness in scheme.

	Don’t think it poss. to abolish Dock scheme.

		But it needs enquiry.  Points in my memo. are for enquiry only.

	Employers, Unions &amp; especially Port Authies shd. be brought in.  It

		wd. have salutary effect if this were known.  Might get larger

		measure of agreemt.



G.A.I.	D. L. Bd is labour supply board.  N.J. Council for Port Transport 

		Industry is the conciliation &amp; arbitn body.  Council nominate

		members to Bd.  And M/L. nominates the other members &amp;

		Chairman etc.

	Few of disputes listed in memo. have anythg. to do with Bd.

	Cd be said Bd. has bn. slow to enforce discipline – tho’ decisions

		have bn. unanimous.

	One or two improvemts. might be possible – e.g. machinery for 

		appeals:  appointmt of independent chairman &amp; Deputy.

	Scheme devised by Coalition Govt.  Worked well in war.

		Might now extend independent element.		[Enter  N.B.

	Want examn by offls. of the 2 Dpts.

	Trouble mainly in Ldn.  Steady elsewhere.

	Also want wider enquiry into what is behind it.  L.P. has had same

		idea.

	Avoid impn tht. scheme is to be scrapped – there’s a small section in

		industry wh. wd. like to see it go.



E.B.	M/T. memo. seems to ignore or be unaware of working of docks.

	Proposal that adminn shd. go to M/T.  Remember traditions of Dpt. –

		ship-owners’ place.  Antagonistic to the men.  And we mayn’t

		always be in office.  Dockers wd. be aghast if told they were 

		to be dominated by M/T.

	Port authorities.  H’to, ship-owners haven’t bn. willing to let them in.

		Get history into yr. heads first.

	Worst moment to suggest it’s being overhauled.  Communists want

		to break it:  so do stevedoring employers:  so do some

		ship-owners.

	This strike isn’t due to scheme.  Was engineered by W.F.T.U.

		Don’t regret this dispute.  Confined to Ldn.  Fight it there.

	If there is to be enquiry, can’t you couple it up with efficiency of

		ports generally.



			[Out for 5 minutes.]



A.B.	Troubled about this for months.

	This dock strike isn’t industrial dispute.  Conspiracy to use Labour

		organn to sabotage our industrial effort.  Judged from that angle

		it has failed.

	Must seek long-term benefits in this.  No good going for short-term

		advantages.

	Must not give the men a grievance all over the country.

	Most unwise therefore to hold a genl. enquiry into Scheme – for that

		wd. be exploited by Communists.

	We aren’t doing enough to indoctrinate men in advance of trouble.

	Leave it all alone pro tem.



C.E.	Agree.  In H/C. on Wed. I was careful to avoid suggestg. scheme

		was in danger.  Yet see what D. worker said on Thursd. – tht.

		I was threatening scheme’s continuance.

	Do nothing now wh. wd. enable Comms. to say we are reviewg.

		Scheme.

	Our tactics are to contain the strike.



P.M.	Wrong time to take any action.

	It wd. support Clem Davies’ line tht. this is due to w’spread 

		discontent.



H.M.	Are there not lessons to be learned from this series of disputes?

	Shd. M/T. be discouraged from bringing this to Cab?  He is the

		responsible Minister.

	Cdn’t there be at least consultn betwn. the 2 Dpts?

	Shdn’t there be quiet enquiry into conditions in docks?

	No hurry.  But don’t say no action at all.

	Ministerial responsibility.  Case for M/T. having this on M.G. grounds.

		And on discipline – awkward for M/L. because conciliation 

		functions.

		Don’t accept argument about Dpl. tradns:  for Ministers are 

		responsible for policy.



E.B.	Don’t dissent.  But timing.  Don’t do anything now.



A.W.	Publicity.



H.M.	Explained Publicity Sub-Cttee of Emergencies Cttee.



E.B.             y/	No conclusion.  No reason why Dpts. shd. not discuss.

			                    Agreed as at y/.



					[Enter  J.S.

	7.	London Dock Strike.



G.A.I.	Explained course of mtgs. with Secretaries of Stevedores &amp;

		Lightermen’s Union.  No regrets about statement in H/C.

	They brought their executives to M/L. on Saturday p.m.

	Read statement published by M/L. on Sunday (or Saturday).

	Read Gould’s report of his mtg. on Saturday.

	C.S.U. have not made any approach for help by Br. Seamen’s Union.

	The Canadian seamen have not bn. double-crossed.  How do we get

		that across?  Will the executives do it?  Govt. have tried again

		&amp; again.



A.B.	Wdn&apos;t Lightermen’s Executive do it separately – even if other Union

		won’t join them.  One Union’s decln wd. “make some ingress.”



H.M.	This is on the turn now.  Believe it best to lie low.



E.B.	Govt. shd. say “no more mtgs.” – no more negotiation:  for we have

		no more to say.  We have given all the informn.

		Nothg. now but resumption of work.

	No more statements until work resumed.

	Say this in H/C. firmly &amp; cut out these “factual” statements.

			Agreed:  H.O. to submit memo. on deportn of B. subjects

			               because disclosed no power in emergency to

			               deport a Canadian Communist organiser.



C.E.	Hope T. &amp; G.W. Union may be induced to-day to declare in E. Ldn.

		that men shd. return to work &amp; work all ships.  Don’t leave it

		to Stevedores &amp; Lightermen’s Union.



J.	Alt. G. shd. consider wtr. grounds enough to prosecute some of these

		Canadians for sedition.



C.E.	He has done &amp; there aren’t grounds.



P.M.	And anyhow it wd. make them martyrs.



E.B.	Deakin can’t say anything until Govt. have said “no more mtgs.”.

		Agreed:   M/L. to say to Unions “I have given you all the

			       informn Govt. have.  Are you comg. to tell me date on

			       wh. men are returning to work?  If not, no purpose in 

			       mtg.”

		Don’t volunteer statement in H/C.

			                                                    [Exit  Solr.G. and Barnes.



	8.	    Meat:  Alternative Sources of Supply.



J.S.	Some improvement since memo. written.

	Argentine &amp; Uruguay:  supplies coming along better because other 

		markets flagging.

	France:  doing better.  also Ireland.

	Doesn’t affect main conclusion viz., for 5 years, only

		a) home prodn   b) Argentine.

	In long term –

		a) Australia  b) Africa.



H.M.	First:  home supplies.  Second:  Austr. and N.Z.

	Viz., concentrate on long-term.



T.W.	Our prodn is increasg. with availability of feed.



H.D.	Australia.  No sense of urgency on their side.  The settled areas cd.

		produce more – apart fr. new territories.  Chifley is keen:  but

		it slips away.  Worth while for us to have a man out there for

		some time to push it along.

	Are M/F. officials keen on it.  Don’t they prefer the dear old

		“usual channels”.

	Long term:  is it safe to rely on Argentines.



J.S.	15 yrs. guarantee offered – unprecedented.

	But Chifley hasn’t come across with his investment plans.

	True there are sceptics in Australia.  Ty. are in fact opposed to big

		cap. expenditure on this.

	Dr Norman Wright is in Canberra now.

	Can’t pretend there is any Austr. enthusiasm for this gamble.



E.B.	Why not collar Dedman while he is here?

			Agreed:  M/F. to see him.
