C.M. 70 (49)					8th December, 1949



1.	     Parliament Bill.

					[Enter W.W.

H.M.	Business for next week.

	Thursday – ½  day available for debate.  Considering wtr. Govt. supporters shdn’t sometimes have these opportunities, on Adjournment.

		Subjects:  development of joint consultn in industry’s or 

			              annual statements of accounts by political 

				        organisations.



A.V.A.	Help voluntarily given wh. doesn’t go into election expenses, by S.W.S.

		Dangerous to pursue this controversy too far.



H.M.	If  you don’t, capitalist wealth will be wholly mobilised v. you at Election.



A.B.	We are entitled to bring out expenditure by cos. r. nationalisation.



T.W.	We are vulnerable on expenditure by C.W.S. eg. loan of cars etc.



R.S.C.	Attack on sterling is even worse – cf. Financial Times this morning – much worse than Tate &amp; Lyle.  Admit we can do nothing about it.

	Any motion on this subject shd. suggest some action.  Shd. therefore be a Motion not an Adjournment.



P.M.	Are you going for a) Contn to funds or b) T &amp; Lyle publicity.  Not the same thing.



			Agreed:  Motion on a) by Byng.     }

			               Govt. Spokesman:  C.E.   }





T.W.	Report of Estimate Cttee.  Tories have tabled Motion tantamount to Vote of Censure – on M/Ag.  House authies say first time for 50 yrs.

		11th Rpt. of Estimate Cttee expresses views recommns.  Motion urges acceptce of all these &amp; expresses regret tht. M/Ag. haven’t done etc.  Goes beyond their functions.

	Estimates Cttee can’t function, with repns of all Parties, if its reports are to be followed by Party Motions.



W.W.	Have gone into this.  There are instances when Supply Days have bn. used in this way, with Party Motions.  Can’t challenge on form.  Our repves on Cttee can protect.  T.W. Can answer on merits.  They cd. have done this on Supply Day:  but there are no more:  they take this opportunity therefore.

T.W.	But Estimates Cttee have more powers than pre-war to send for persons and pp.  On precedent of war-time Nat. Expendre Cttee.



A.B.	These Cttees are going beyond functions.  Offls. are being required to spend excessive time in giving evce.  P.A.C. also.  Must watch this in new Parliament.





A.	Festival of Britain &amp; Parlt. Square Bills.

	Have persuaded Chairman of Cttees to reduce fr. 10 days to 5 the period for petitions.  Also it is agreed tht., despite rules of procedure, all can go thro’ in one day – provided no opposn in Cttee.  All depends therefore on attitude of Middlesex Co. Council.



H.M.	Doing utmost to persuade them.  If we fail, recognise Bills must be lost.





2.	     Wool Industry Development Council.

					[Enter Att. Genl.

H.W.	“Substantial no. engaged in industry” desire it.

	Employers now argue this must include employers as well as workers.

	Solrs. actg. for wool employers argue no power to make order &amp; seeking decn of courts.  Ministers decided not to go on with H/C. procdgs. while sub ????:  at mtg. this week.

	Announced it wdn’t be taken this week.  Thereafter, Fin. Times said writ wdn’t issue unless Motion put down again – cat &amp; mouse.



R.S.C.	Breach of privilege by newspaper?



H.M.	Publd Tuesday.  Too late to raise that now.



H.W.	Shd. I write saying tht. unless writ issued by specified date, Motion will be brought fwd.  Or shd. we put down Motion.



Att. G.	Thought a lr. was to be sent to solrs. giving terms i.e. tht. if writ issued 

                   x/	this week &amp; we wd. suspend Motion m’while,  provided they 

	proceeded with expeditiously.

	On merits, I think court cd. say substantial cross section of industry is required.  Some Judges might take that line.

	Still recommend we shd. do x/.



A.B.	Don’t enter into corrce with them.  Clothing trade have now issued writ.

		Leave wool alone &amp; let issue come fwd. on clothing Order.



R.S.C.	Support view of leaving wool alone &amp; letting clothing come to courts.

			Agreed: Wool Motion not to be put down.

			              Clothing Order to be made.





3.	     Council of Europe.

					           [Enter C.M.

P.M.	Tho’ we were doubtful, wanted to rally other Powers.

	Consultns have shown tht. all but Greece &amp; Turkey &amp; prs. Norway other Powers are not supportg.  Committee of Ministers.  They are sending repves.

	E.B. now advises tht. we send our repves &amp; pay their expenses;  and he will protest at next mtg. of Cttee of Ministers.



R.S.C.	Our earlier decn is known to M.P.’s.  V. weak to go back on it.

	Surrender to Reynaud., who wants a rival organisn to O.E.E.C.

	We told our supporters.



P.M.	But we based our decn on attitude of Cttee of Ministers.  Now find it isn’t their view.



H.D.	This confirms what I said at earlier mtgs.  Criticism here &amp; abroad for pedantry.

	This mtg. will happen whatever you do - &amp; most countries will be repd.



A.B.	We mustn’t vacillate.

	I talked to Norwegian Amb. as promised.  P.M. says they may support us.

	Have F.O. bn. as effective with other Powers as I was with Norway?

	Do we give way on all Cttee mtgs. – abrogating all control by Cttee/Ministers.



P.M.	Agree F.O. shd. have got a common line earlier.  But now it’s v. diff. to stand by Cttee of Ministers when all the others don’t stand by it.



C.M.	Had to decide wtr. to make statemt. on Mon.  At that time 7 replies in.

	All negative.  If we had blundered into it then, we shd. have found no support either in H/C. or in other Govts.  My only argument was tht. decn of Cttee/Ministers was binding on all.  Can’t use that when all others rat on it.



N.B.	Reluctant support of Norway &amp; Greece won’t help us.

	Standing aside fr. all others won’t  help to secure our primary purpose of solidarity of Cttee/Ministers.



R.S.C.	Last time Cab. asked to support E.B.’s view.  Now asked to support F.O. view.  100% different.



P.M.	No.



A.B.	We are in a jamb.

	But sorry to find we have so little influence with other Govts.

	If Cttee meets &amp; issues statement (at Eccles’ instigation) ….



			Agreed:  as P.M. proposed.



				[Exit W.W. &amp; C.M.

			                                                         [Enter G.S., Key &amp; Hall	

4.	     Communists etc., Secret Govt. Contracts.



G.A.I.	Views of N.J.A.C.  Do what they say.



P.M.	No statement:  no appeal:  Ministers act.

	What do you say if it’s raised?



G.A.I.	Plead the contract.



A.B.	All the Union wd. want is to be able to say “why has man bn. removed”.  Ministers request will then be disclosed.



H.M.	Then they will say “why does Minister think him unreliable”.

	Must work it this way &amp; defend action on merits in any individual case.



G.A.I.	Union mght. ask Minister if satisfied there is a case.



G.S.	The people involved aren’t members of Unions.  Aircraft industry 8 persons – scientists etc., not members of Union. We tell employer (prob. knows already):  he won’t act save on order fr. us:  man will make political row, prob. denying that he is a communist.  Sure to be public controversy on first case - because no opportunity for appeal.



H.M.	Say merely he isn’t a suitable person to be employed on secret work.  And Whips must support.



Att.G.	Take the good Fascist line – safety of State – and be damned to the libertarians.



H.	Can manage industrials, with no difficulty.  Doing it now.

		I’m concerned mainly with industrials.



C.K.	We shd. be included.  Agreed.

			                                               [Exit Att.G., Key, Hall &amp; G.S.

					Enter W.W.

5.	     Prorogation Speech.



R.S.C.	Strasbourg.  Last sentence puts it a bit high.

		“close interest” – Agreed.



P.M.	Eire?



H.M.	Thought better pass over in silence.

N.B.	Agree.  We send King’s message on bloody Monday.  Success – leave it at that.



			Agreed with amendments.

					[Exit W.W.

					[Re-enter C.M.

6.	     Indonesia:  Arms Embargo.



A.V.A.	This = F.O. memo.

	But it has my support.



P.M.	For informn of Cab.?



C.M.	Yes.



			Approved.
