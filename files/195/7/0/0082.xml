C.M. 19(50).				6th April, 1950.





	1.	National Health Service.                  [Enter  E.S., H.G.,  H.H.M.



P.M.	Read rest of agreed formula – as settled with R.S.C. &amp; Health

		Ministers.



H.D.	A good formula.



P.M.	Cab. Cttee will watch this.  Any signs of rising costs will be met by

		effective action to check it.  Cuts to be imposed to offset any rise 

		because expansion.



H.M.	Are H.McN.’s suggns to be pursued?



A.B.	Only if rising costs make it necessary?



P.M.	Agreed.



H.M.	Can’t wait until you are bang up v. it.



P.M.	At 1st sign of danger effective steps will be taken.



H.D.	All suggns of A. &amp; E.S. will be considered by Cttee?



P.M.	Yes.



A.B.	Cttee is to examine expre in reln to estimate month by month;  and all

		these suggns will be considered if signs of excessive expre.



P.M.	Cttee can consider these misc. suggns in advance of that.

	Must be clear:  can’t p’pone action if necessary because bye-election

		etc.



H.M.	Some of the suggns were valuable per se.  Don’t exclude them until

		expre runs ahead of estimate.



P.M.	Won’t exclude those things.

			                                           [Exit  H.G., E.S., H.H.M.



	2.	China:  Civil Aircraft.                          [Enter  Att.G. &amp; Younger.



J.	I shd. have bn. consulted.



E.B.	I consulted L.O.’s.  I mentioned matter to J.

	Not for me to determine what cases L.O.’s refer to J.

	Surely it’s for Att.G. to decide that.

	F.O. refer many cases to L.O.’s.

	I will not allow my Dpt. to decide wh. cases shd. go to Att.G. or to J.

P.M.	I will consider further directions.



Att.G.	In last 5 yrs. more trouble has arisen thro’ cases being referred to

		J. vice L.O.



J.G.	Summd memo.

	In urging corpns to leave in July Govr. warned Americans there wd. be

		trouble if Comm. Govt. came into power &amp; claimed them.

	Since then many repns and legal actions.  U.S. corpn v. hastily formed,

		claimed in Dec. to have bought the aircraft fr. Nat Govt.

		Disputed – and no legal decn ever reached.

	Govr. can take delaying action.  but can’t take any action based on

		view tht. these planes are U.S. property.  Also, politically, it wd.

		be unwise qua provoking Comm. Govt. to instigate trouble in

		H. Kong.

	To help U.S. we have considered what further delaying devices we cd.

		adopt.

	Action under Art. 60 cd. be challenged in courts.  If we lost, we shd.

		incur damages.  Proposal was put to Govr.  He thinks such action

		wd. not be objective &amp; might provoke Ch. retaliation.  The

		H. Kong Att. G. has advised Govr. tht. this use of Art. 60 wd. not

		be lawful.



Att.G.	Ques. of policy, not law.

	Is it better to meet U.S. pressure by doubtful use of law or by altering

		it – with risk of Ch. retaliation.  Or, is opp. course preferred.

	I was told there was extreme U.S. pressure &amp; we must satisfy them we

		had exhausted all conceivable legal means of detaining aircraft.

		Art. 60 afforded that – because uncertainty of regn.

	I said tht. to use Art. 60 for this purpose wd. be subterfuge because

		object of Art. is to promote safety in air.  Concluded Govr. cd.

		use these powers.  But wd. only delay until validity of regn

		establd.  At worst, after gt. delay, award by Privy Council for 

		exceedg. powers.

	Realise views of H. Kong Govr. &amp; Courts.  They think it essential to

		play fair to Chinese.  I too wd. resign, if in H. Kong, if these

		powers were used for this doubtful purpose.

	If it is still case tht. U.S. must be met, better course is to be 

		straightforward &amp; make O-in-C. here placing embargo on

		removal of aircraft until ownership settled.  This wd. breach

		international understandg. tht. Ch. Govt. have jurisdictional

		immunity …..  important right we are seekg. to establish in 

		courts in gold case

	i)	Chinese Govt. might then go to Internatl court.

	ii)	Until embargo lifted, we shd. have accept respons. for m’taing. 

		planes.

	Two methods.  a) O-in-C. in U.K. puttg. embargo on export of all war

		material fr. any Colony w’out licence.  With proviso allowg. it

		on proof of ownership.  This wd. bring legn Cols. into line with

		our U.K.

			       b) O-in-C. puttg. embargo ad hoc on these planes.

	Either method wd. invade Ch. jurisd. immunity.

	Strictly neutral &amp; honest course wd. be to leave Americans to their 

		legal remedies in courts.



P.M.	Resent U.S. threats – esp. re Marshall Aid.



E.B.	All looked v. fishy to me.

	Also inconsistent with U.S. attitude re colonialism in Trusteesh. 	Council.

	Told U.S. I cdn’t advise C.O. to break the law.  U.S. Govt. accepted

		that.  But I think they then assumed they wd. get injunction.

	Warned U.S. tht. illegal action by us over this wd. provoke trouble in

		Asia generally.

	U.S. delayed entering appeal.

	Manner of Americans in H. Kong twds. our people hasn’t helped.

	Legal chances – believe Ch. will win, on ownership.  But change of

		Govt. leaves me in some doubt.  Not satisfied that effect of

		recognn of new Ch. Govt …….  F.O. opinion given to

		Judge …….. not sure this wd. be upheld.  This shd. be looked

		into.

	Any legve action shd. be taken by U.K. Govt., not by ordering

		H. Kong Govt. to do it.  Wdn’t ask for more than simple 

		legn(?) on ad hoc basis ii) overleaf.

	Can’t tolerate bullying tactics of Donovan.

			Conclusion:  favour legn.  Wd. like to see it in draft.

			Don’t want another Malaya.

	Agree we can’t press Govr. to use Art. 60.



P.M.	Who will determine ownership?



Att.G.	H. Kong Courts haven’t jurisdiction.  But if we alter law to remove

		jurisdictional immunity, we cd. provide tht. H. Kong Courts cd.

		determine ownership.



J.	Support plan of O-in-C.  For arguable ques. who is owner:  &amp; right

		therefore to hold property until that ques. can be settled.



A.B.	Isn’t O-in-C. admn of our wrong conduct?  For implies we haven’t now

		power to detain.  And we are altering status quo to detriment of

		Ch. Govt. = act of hostility.



A.V.A.	Para. 14.  Everything turns on wtr. Beckett’s view was right.



P.M.	What is our ultimate posn to be?

	Are we playing for time – only to be faced later with dilemma of

		supportg. the law &amp; offending U.S.  Are we any better off in

		settling that later rather than now?



Att.G.	A little different.  U.S. wd. feel fair thing is to try ques. of ownership

		to highest court.

	a)	Are we to exhaust all existg. devices under law.  Art. 60.

	b)	Are we to legislate  i) generally or ii) ad hoc in reln to these

			planes.

	c)	Are we to stand aside.

	Politics apart, we shd. take c).



E.B.	I assumed courts wd. grant injunction.  If we make O-in-C. ground

		for action (cf. A.B.) wd. be tht. courts in H.K. did not grant it.

		Want to put that right.

	Can’t say to U.S. tht. we will do nothg. to enable ques. of ownership

		to be settled.  If we do that, &amp; courts decide it against U.S.,

		it can’t be helped.



E.Sh.	Para. 9 on Defence aspects.  Chinese might use these aircraft for

		purposes embarrassing to us – e.g. in Indo China.

	Latest apprecns of H. Kong indicate tht. internal posn is deteriorating.

		That cuts both ways.  For if Ch. Govt. are upset over aircraft,

		they may make this worse.



T.W.	Suppose courts decide in favour of Americans, &amp; Chinese in

		possession flouted decision.  Shd. we not get into conflict with 

		Ch. Comms.



A.B.	Para. 7.  We are by covert action preventg. Ch. Comms. fr. getting

		their way.  Worse if, after 28/4, we over-rule court.



Att.G.	No.  For they will decide they have no power to try the issue of

		ownership.  We shall legislate to empower them to do so.



A.B.	Thus depriving the Ch. of jurisdictional immunity.  V. ugly.



K.Y.	Cdn’t convince U.S. Amb. tht. we were actg. impartially in failing to

		protect the property while title is being establd in law.



			Discussion suspended.





	3.	Film:  “Chance of a Lifetime”.



G.A.I.	Employers’ organns objectg. qua encouraging Commn.



H.W.	Act of ’48 empowers me to direct tht. a film be shown.  I act on

	advice of independent Tribunal.

	Many people have seen it &amp; think it O.K.

	Ince doesn’t like it.



H.M.	Govt. shdn’t get into posn of directg. circuit to show a particular film.



P.M.	B/T. can’t go against decision of Tribunal.

			Agreed as at x/.





	2.	China:  Civil Aircraft.



Att.G.	J.G. feels action must be taken here.  O-in-C.



E.B.	I agree.  Want to consult Att.G. re presentn.   Explan. statement

		showg. we are confining ourselves to holdg. property pending

		decn.

	Shall also want to warn U.S. &amp; Chinese Govts. in advance.



A.V.A.	Fear Comm. Govt. will feel they can move after 28/4.  If we act to 

		prevent that, may provoke Ch. Govt. action v. us in H. Kong.



E.B.	We must, as U.K. Govt., take the action.



E.Sh.	Thought Att.G. said even so no guarantee we cd. prevent transfer of

		aircraft to Ch. Govt.



Att.G.	Can’t be.  Wd. depend on decision of courts, up to Privy Council.



E.B.	Mustn’t play the delaying game.



Att.G.	Cdn’t be v. quick.  Present action shd. be appealed to Privy Council.

		Then fresh action on ownership will have to be started simultan.

		Expedited, it wd. take 6 months.



E.Sh.	Internal disturbances in H. Kong.  What effect on that wd. delay have?

		If internal posn deteriorates in consequence of this we may have

		to divert troops back fr. Malaya.  But that is vital.

	Choice of evils.  a) upset U.S.  b) upset Chinese.

	Wd. it not suffice (to prevent appearance of delay) to leave it to H.K.

		courts &amp; not bring it to U.K.?



Att.G.	Then the planes can be flown off because no injunction.

	O-in-C. gives them jurisdn to try ownership.



C.E.	This course is repugnant to me.  U.S. seem to think our law can be 

		altered when it seems inconvenient to them.  cf. Eisner case.

		Current request for facilities for U.S. authies to ques. U.S. citizen 

		in Br. custody.

	Here we are passing legn to apply retrospectively to this dispute.

	Suggests tht. rule of law in U.K. is subject to pol. expediency.

	Course recommded by F.O. = breach with long tradn.  And if we yield

		here, we shall be subject to heavy pressure in future by U.S.



A.B.	We stayed in H.K. (despite U.S. views) because we believed our 

		presence there wd. be bridge betwn. new China &amp; rest of world.

	If we alter law to suit U.S. needs here, Ch. Comm. will regard our

		presence in H.K. as threat to them.

	Wd. confirm U.S. view tht. Colonies are at disposal of U.K. Govt. for

		their purposes &amp; convenience.

	Defence consns.  Def. v. internal disturbance is imposs.  And this 

		action will inflame internal feeling.  Impartiality of court cdn’t

		be believed after we had altered the law to suit U.S. convenience.

	Bearing on Treaty with China re H. Kong.  Ch. Govt. have rights under

		that.



J.	No doubt we have right to legislate for H. Kong.



P.M.	Sympathise with C.E.

	1)	Will it be effective?  Planes will be there m’while &amp; subject to

			being filched.

	2)	If act in cold war, yes.  But if we are still standing on rule of 

			law, no.

	3)	Asia will think we are comg. down on side of whites.

	4)	Lawyers e.g. in India will say it’s U.S. Imperialism.



A.	Strongly endorse this view.



H.McN.	This assumes we shall gain in prestige by standing on rule of law.

		Assumes Ch. support for our in-action.

		Just as likely Ch. will think it’s a bribe to get negotns for

		dipl. recognition completed.

	Pretty shady business on both sides.

	We told U.S. all processes of law up to Privy Council will be open

		to you:  &amp; added tht. m’while property will probably be

		protected.

		Trouble is:  we can’t now honour second point.

	Bound therefore to offend one side or other.  My guess is tht. Ch. will

		restrain forces in H.K. until it suits them to move v. us.

		My concln:  we can’t hope to placate Chinese.

		Can we placate U.S.A.?  Yes.  Try to do anything reasonably

		justifiable wh. wd. meet U.S. views.



Att.G.	Risk:  Privy Council might decide in favour of U.S. after planes had

		bn. flown away.



E.B.	Impressed by C.E.’s statement.

		Inclined to try once more with U.S. to avoid havg. to decide here.

		Adjourn discns for one or two weeks.



J.	I don’t regard proposal as interference with rule of law.

	We cd. make a genl. O-in-C. w’out any ques. of interference.  And we

		cd. add proviso tht. any who prove claim to property may

		remove.



C.E.	Because you do it after situation has arisen - &amp; to meet wishes of U.S.



Att.G.	M’while what is Govr. to do?



E.B.	Nothing:  take a chance.



Att.G.	Govr. must be told that one way or another, legal or illegal, he

		must prevent departure of planes m’while – under Art. 60 or

		otherwise.



P.M.	Let him carry on as before, w’out invoking Art. 60.

				[Exit  Att.G.

				[Enter  M.W. &amp; H.G.

	4.	Points Rationing for Food.



P.M.	Have you considered long-term possibility of coming back to this?



M.W.	No risk in long-term.  Only short-term.



A.V.A.	Ques. of principle.  Goes back on fair shares.  Is it necessary.

		Cdn’t you deal with situation by adjustment of pointing.



M.W.	Increasg. points allowed to level at wh. goods wd. move means 

		value of pts. is lost:  &amp; increases pressure on short-supply goods.

	Adjustg. points values.  Means 4 pts.  Means poor person cdn’t if 

		living alone get any points goods valued at more than 16.



H.W.	Same problem exactly as I had a year ago on clothes rationg. 

		Only way is to cancel rationg.

	Fair shares.  Need is to m’tain price control.  And easier to do it with

		food than with clothes.



M.W.	Another sanction for fair shares.  Unit voucher system.  Gives ration

		to retailer &amp; he rations consumer.  He does so now.



H.G.	R.S.C. opposed to proposal.  He believes right course is to exclude

		Group A fr. scheme:  keep 9 others in &amp; adjust pointing

		accordingly.  He fears sweets situation being repeated.

	Para. 9.  M/F. asks for much extra sugar.  Can’t give him any for

		this purpose.



M.W.	Want this settled on merits, irresp. of sugar.



H.W.	You can’t m’tain points rationing when some articles are highly 

		desired &amp; short.  Points are regarded as title to what people want.



H.M.	Awkward to reject combined recommn of B/T. and M/F.

	Staff of 1.000.  Trouble to retailers.

	Don’t say “fair shares” &amp; stop thinking.

	Cat. C. is only headache.  M/F. must be careful with p. refns on 

		this if we approve his proposal.



A.V.A.	Ration to retailers w’out coupon return is not just.



H.G.	Diffce betwn. clothes &amp; food points:  period of clothes ration was

		v. much longer &amp; cdn’t therefore vary pointing nearly so much.



H.W.	True.  But even so I cdn’t have put pts. value of shirts &amp; sheets high

		enough to hold scheme.



M.W.	Co-op. want points rationg. dropped so long as Unit Voucher system

		is m’tained.



G.A.I.	Take the risk &amp; get some credit from housewives.



H.D.	Fear repetition of sweets.



M.W.	Dpt. are not w’out wisdom gained by experience of sweets.



			Discussion adjourned until 2.30 p.m.
