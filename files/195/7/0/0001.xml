C.M.1(49)							12th January 1949



		1.	Census of Distribution.	[Enter J.S., H.H.M., C.W.K.



H.W.	As in memo.

	Means of minimising political impact.



R.S.C.	Essential to planning – esp. natl income and consumption – to get this informn as quickly as possible.

	Only quick means of discerning disinflationary tendency. No means now of knowing how spending is related to a normal.



H.D.	Recognise importance of getting informn.

	Five year intervals : means won’t help much on disinflation.

	Politically unwise to do it just before election. Esp. in rural areas.

	Small shops won’t find this easy. Their diffies will be exploited by Tories.

	Advantages of doing this in 1950 don’t outweigh political embarrassment.

	Electorally wise.

	P’pone for one year.



H.M.	On merits undoubtedly desirable. V. bad luck that it is timed like this.

	Cd. political effects be minimised eg. Press conference, help to small shops.

	If it has to be, sooner it’s announced the better.



B.	Not Departmentally urgent to us.



C.K.	P’ponemt. involves diffy. over accommn for census staff.  Wd. mean finding it in Ldn. in 1950.



H.W.	600 staff to be kept on from M/P.



H.H.M.	I cd. p’pone my re-orgn for 12 mos. with diffy.



A.B.	Popn census will also be held in spring of 1951.  An argument against p’ponemt.



P.M.	[Eases the ques. “another little census won’t do us any harm”.



H.D.	Or more vexatious.



P.M.	No. Makes it fall naturally into place as an ordinary affair.]



A.B.	Don’t favour p’ponement. H.D. under-rates intelligence of electors.



P.M.	P’ponement wd. give an argument to pol. opponents.



H.W.	P’ponement wd. strengthen a nascent campaign v. Prodn Census.

G.A.I.	Against p’ponement.



A.	Support H.D. Don’t even like this on its merits.

	E.g. small shops selling many things. How will we select first 4.

	How will it cover costs of distribn Or it’s misdirection.

	Can deal with this problem only on commodity basis. This won’t help you to formulate a policy.



	Para. 14.

	This return won’t give informn required.

	Politically, this wd. be folly.



P.M.	Ques. 12. is diff. for village general shop.



R.S.C.	Most people wd. be able to select 4 things they sell most.

	Will show general pattern of consumption and local differentiation.



A.	M/F. know that.



R.S.C.	Only as regards rational goods.



P.M.	Random sampling wd. give you as much informn.



E.B.	Purposes for which it would be used?



R.S.C.	E.g. purchase tax.

	No basic pattern to which to apply sampling.



H.W.	Pressure for a “distribution policy”. I am sceptical. Many people mean by this reducing no. of retail shops. W’out statistical informn. no one can say what wd. make sense.



H.D.	Will this help? Obvious tht. distn cost cd. be reduced by massacring small shops. It’s the political diffy. of doing it.

	We can’t frame a policy w’out this informn.



H.M.	I begin to be doubtful. Collecting informn with a view to killing small shop.



R.S.C.	Cttee recommended this. Parlt. passed it w’out divisions. Because it was thought obviously right. Do you want to go back to ‘hit and miss’ methods?



J.S.	Tho’ M/F. can p’pone, they do want the informn.



H.D.	And I agree that it is wanted.



G.T.	a) statement on form tht. informn won’t be available to other Dpts.

	b) no one who has made income tax return will have any diffy. with this form.

	Let us be practical. If this is needed, ignore political arguments.



H.H.M.	This is biggest gap in our informn eg. growth of retail trade in depressed areas.

	For planning if you reduce distr. margins wd. that give you result.

	How many people wd. be affected by redn of 10%.



E.B.	P’pone. Results won’t justify political diffies.



C.J.	P’pone.



C.K.	P’ponement means for 2 years not one, doesn’t it?



A.B.	Does this discn mean that you can never have any intelligent economic planning in a political democracy?

	“Immaculate conception of safe seats”. Rubbish. Safe seats were made by political courage.



E.B.	Must be able to say what you want this informn for.  No one will tell me.



R.S.C.	We don’t know the patterns of trade. We are guessing at consumption totals. Want better informn for purposes of fiscal and economic policy.



E.B.	Taxation 



R.S.C. 	Not mainly – for economic policy generally.



A.V.A.	This argument shd. have taken place before Act passed. Assume no argument now on merits.

	If it’s right, we shdn’t be deterred by political inconvenience.

	If you are going to discuss with certain interests a distribution policy and at same time deliberately p’pone getting agreed informn.

	The form itself is, however, inadequate. Will this give you much more than genl. impressions from Co-ops etc.



P.M.	Large degree of scepticism re value of this informn.

	Feeling that value will endure to another C/Exchequer.



A.B.	Cd. we canvass opinions outside Cabinet? Advice on effects of doing this. eg. from organisers.



P.M.	And other members of Govt.



H.M.	Danger of leakage.



H.W.	Wd. prefer decision to p’pone one year than p’pone decision any further.

	The political effects of prelimy. forms and notices cd. be accepted.



R.S.C.	Can then become election issue wthr. you take the census or not. For notice will have been given. 



H.W. 	Answer to that is easy.



	Agreed : P’pone for one year.

						[Exit C.K., J.S., H.H.M.,

						[Enter Att. Genl. Pakenham



		2.	Ireland.



P.M.	As in brief. Reasons why some legn is required.

	Also balance between N. and South.



	a)	Constitutional Safeguards.



	Pledge by all political Parties. Wd. have covered fractionals. Better to have declaration by Parlt. – as in Cl. 1(1)(b). Repeats statement which I made in H/C. to wh. no exception was taken. Believe we must do this.



P.	Any territorial guarantee is v. dangerous. Frontier is indefensible.

	The 2 counties. No case for stopping them joining N. Ireland.



P.M.	It would be someone else’s initiative. Cd. be argued before internatl forum.

	Yours is only one side of argument. There are Unionists in the 2 counties. Need for viability. eg. division in Palestine or Pakistan.

	Anyhow, we are dealing with need for consent.



P.	Majority in N.I. wd. never consent to relinquish their grip over minority.



J.	Incln of the 2 counties makes it more possible to get majority in N. as a whole to vote for unity.



H.D.	Since P’s book, there has bn. a war. Has affected my view anyhow.

	And many other peoples, too.



H.M.	B/Atlantic. Security given us thro’ N. Ireland – what cd. we have done w’out it. Even apart fr. N.I. feelings we must be clear tht. it’s not in our interests tht. N.I. shd. go out of U.K.



P.M.	Cession of 2 counties wd. not affect South’s desire for the whole. 



P. 	No.



P.	Agree we cdn’t afford to see all Ireland neutral. But shd. we not be better placed if Ireland had a defence pact with us. What is our real objective. Small N.I. base? Or political unity of Ireland : defensive unity of 2 islands.



P.M.	Aim at that if you like. But nobody has got it in the bag yet.

	Frustrated by South – during war : again now. By putting ideological desire for Republic above practical need for united Ireland.

	But, for sake of hypothetical strategic unity, I won’t risk civil war in Ireland.



A.B.	Can’t say less than this now.

	We must keep N.I. with us.



E.B.	Support this clause.



	b)	Defence of N. Ireland.



P.M.	Really follows from a). It is wise to say it? Shall be asked.

	Part of U.K. We cdn’t help coming to assistance.



R.S.C.	Not “assist”. Defend U.K. as such. Not for N.I. to do it.

	Ulster volunteers shd. be illegal.



E.B.	Scared of big Protestant re-action. Resentment against R.C.’s as well as v. Communists. Don’t take advantage of our tolerance.



N.B.	Wd. rather that statement wasn’t volunteered. If asked, you must give this answer.



P.M.	Accept that. Don’t want to increase tension.



E.B.	And preface it by saying we hope it will never arise.



A.V.A.	N.I. has never bn. brought into Nat. Service. May be raised that they shd. stand their corner. 



A.B. 	Same point as Quebec.



P.	Treatment of minorities in South is much better than in North.

		Don’t give the North a blank cheque.



C.E.		I recognise that diffy. and have pointed it out to N.I. Don’t defend all 		their actions. But we must defend their territory as Kent.

		Remember also their problems – faced with armed insurrection.



		c)	Titles.



P.M.	“Ulster” wd. have trailed a coat among Irishmen in Commonwealth.

	N.I. Ministers accepted “N.I.” eventually.

	They wanted us, however, to go on using “Eire”. But other countries won’t do so. Suggested therefore we shd. use “Republic of Ireland”.

	N.I. prefer “Irish Republic”.

	But let us not speak of “Ireland”.



	Can we put Republic of Ireland on Bill: but use in official pp. etc.

	Irish Republic or Southern Ireland.		Agreed.



	d)	Boundary, and Irish Lights.



P.M.	As in memo. Don’t raise boundary issues. Try to get U.K. repn. on Irish Lights Commn.



C.E.	C.R.O.	to communicate with H.O. on this – to m’tain principle that it is part of U.K.



	e)	Extra Territorial Powers.



P.M.	Additional subjects : Cl. 6.



C.E.	They want to add “reguln. of harbours”. O.K. subject to consulting Admy. and M/T.



A.B.	Don’t add to powers of N.I. Parlt.



C.E.	Cl. 6 is the method to work twds. unity of Ireland.



H.M.	Does it protect Br. Ty.



	f)	Westminster Franchise.



P.M.	Told them this was politically diff. Asked them to modify their 7 years’ qualification.



	Debate on prepn. of People Bill.	

	Message from B. Brooke. He can’t reduce his 7 year qualification.

	Diff. for us to do this w’out a quid pro quo.

	Diff. also for them.



N.B.	They have a v. strong case, in their present circs. Diff. for C.E. to put it across to Parlt.



C.E.	Small increases in Nat. vote cd. swing their repn. over.

	Suppose you got majority of W’minster repves. in favour of ending Partition while N.I. Parlt. were still solid against it. And in an internatl. court might be asked to say which was the more democratic ally correct vote.

	From practical angle, wd. it make any diffce. to N.I. if their qualificn. were 3 years not 7.



P.M.	Remember Eire has ceased to be member/Comm. People in G.B. voting who owe no allegiance. May be pressed to disfranchise them here. But we can’t distinguish.

A.B.	Cd. amend the law later if need proved.



H.M.	We cd. say their’s is their affair. If our circs. were same as theirs we shdn’t have dropped residence qualificn in Repn of People Bill.

	How can you force that on a country with land border with county outside Commonwealth.



E.B.	eg. Nat. Service: 2 years before Dom. citizens called up. Yet allow any one to vote w’out residence qualificn. 



J.	N.I. haven’t done us well by giving no quid pro quo.



C.E.	Allegns of gerrymandering in N.I. elections.

	Criticism from Govt. supporters.



N.B.	Dulanty has made it clear tht. they object to alteration in franchise.

	That gives the game away.



Att.G.	V. diff. for them at this moment to reduce their 7 year vote.

	Our Bill retains right of Eire citizens to vote for U.K. Parliament.

	They think of them as foreigners. And we ask them at same time to reduce their qualificn.

	In Doms. there is some residence qualifn. for B. subjects.



A.W.	Change now if at all.



	Agreed : P.M. to press Sir B. Brooke on this.



	(g)	Disqualification of Members of Parliament.



P.M.	V. diff. proposition.



C.E.	They want also power to relieve M.P. disqualified by corruption.



	Agreed : reject this clause.





	(h)	Supreme Court.



J.	Not for this Bill.



	(i)	Other Recommendations of N. Party.



	(xxiii)	Genl. agreemt. tht. Eire shd. remain on Sterling Area Stat. Cttee.



	Time-table.

	Consultn. :  All Crown Govts. to be consulted.	Agreed.



		3.	European Unity.



E.B.	Diffy. largely because publicity from Quai d’Orsay.

	Sub-Cttee working w’out instns. Tried to reconcile diffces and conflate ideas.

	No commitments on Govts.

	I thought it wrong to have them longer w’out instns on principles.

	Fr. Socialists don’t want Govts. in. Want to use this as means of forcing their Govt. to act. Many responsible Frenchmen have asked us not to play in their game.

	We must start in tentative way.

	Choice : join Brussels Pact or Atlantic Pact. Internally, diff. for many Euro. countries to do either. E.g. Italy.

	But something more than mtg. of For. Ministers. Tried in this memo. to combine original idea of executive Govts with desire of others for an Assembly. Means Eur. conference, annual : but Govts. to put fwd. Agenda and keep control.

	If their instns given, report can be made – agreed or not. Consultative Cttee of Brussels Powers must consider on 26/1/49.

	Some points for decision in [  ].

	Shd. I refer at all to O.E.E.C. at this stage?

	Para.3a). Functions. H.D. wd. prefer to omit or to modify to avoid leading them on to Federation at this stage.



H.D.	Content with broad lines of this.

	Not v. successful report.

	Fr. will ask for diff. plan and we shall prob. get 2 alternatives put up to Consultve. Council.

	Functions (para. 3). shd. be omitted. At worst, go into preamble.

	Time-table. Don’t want to delay Cons. Cttee. mtg. Intend to go over on Monday and try to finish in a week. Abandoning idea of getting agreement.



H.M.	P. 11 Wdn’t be P.M. or For. Secy. on every occasion.



P.M.	Any advocates of Fr. scheme? None offered.



R.S.C.	Some opportunity for Council to discuss ques. other than those submitted to them by Ministers.



E.B.	Keep it in reserve as concession to throw to French.



R.S.C.	With tight rein on voting you can be looser on agenda.



P.M.	Go for smaller nos. rather than large. Otherwise pressure to bring in repves. of Opposns.    Agreed: go for smaller number. tho’ 8 may be too small. E.g. 12.



Discussion adjourned.
