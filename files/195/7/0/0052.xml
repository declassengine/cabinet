C.M. 58 (49)					13th October, 1949



1.	     Economic Situation:  Publicity to Industry.



			                                                  [Enter J.S., H.G., B and G.S.



R.S.C.	Plan conceived in W’ton because changed attitude of W’ton &amp; Ottawa.

	Have arranged mtg. with Civil Servants.

	Saw F.B.I. N.U.M. A.B.C.C. &amp; ? someone else:  more behind W’ton communiqué, wanted to explain.  They were chilly &amp; non-committal.  Asked for consultn with executives etc.  Said, eventually, no objn.

	T.U.C. seen – advised p’ponement.  Uncertain of their policy – afraid of Communists.

	Thereafter wanted to tackle separate indies.

	W’ton talks forgotten – everyone thinkg. only in terms of devaln.

	Wd still like to go ahead &amp; wd. wish to consult E.B. further.



A.B.	W’draw my objns.



H.W.	Favour drive on workers only, since employers unwilling – Free to spk. more politically.

	Attack directly &amp; in favour of Joint Prodn Cttees, as well as Developmt. Council.



H.M.	Approve plans in memo.

	Speakers must be informative re Govts. policy.

	Want publicity to go further &amp; as soon as policy on expre etc., is settled.

		Pamphlet (4 pp) explaing. sitn &amp; stops to meet it:  house to house.

	B.B.C. Co-opn to be enlisted by R.S.C.



P.M.	Don’t assume every employer is re Govt.  Trade Assocns may not represent individual firms.



G.A.I.	Survey of progress in J. Councils shows failure due to apathy of workers rather than employers.  Will submit memo. later.

	Word “Prodn” is an obstacle.



A.W.	Put responsibility on employers – don’t assume they won’t co-operate.

		Give them a chance to fall down.



E.B.	Don’t forget U.S. &amp; Canada have to co-operate in taking our exports.

		Don’t make it political issue, too much, here.

	Wd. like to talk further over this with R.S.C. &amp; H.W.

	T.U.C. aren’t really hostile.  They want more informn – fear too general an approach.

	Particular ques. need detailed attentn.  Told tht., if we exploited Scottish Connn with Canada, we might do more.  Or Wales in U.S.A.

	More attention to detail.



			Agreed:  R.S.C. &amp; E.B. to discuss with other Prodn Ministers.



				[Exit B., H.G. &amp; J.S.



2.	     Iron and Steel Bill:  Dorman Long.



G.S.	Possible to separate.  Pity to do so because well integrated.

	Steel Bd. don’t need it.  But advantageous to State to talk over 1/3rd struct. engineering.



H.M.	S.I.M. Cttee considered this &amp; thght. it shd. come to Cab.

	We have handled Bill on basis of steel.  Wd. be open to criticism if we took over 1/3rd of another industry incidentally.  Fr. Parly. angle better to have this out.



P.M.	Also, don’t bite off more than you can chew.



A.B.	“Labour B. in Brit.” suggests policy of doing more. – esp. in socialisg. parts of induies to compete with rest.

	This wd. be a good start in such a policy.

	Why avoid it – when this wd. come over naturally.



H.M.	Some of their contracts are overseas - &amp; some branches too.

	Corpn will have enough to do in U.K. – may get into complications overseas.



H.D.	Don’t want to risk dollars.  Cd. we hive off only the overseas side.



R.S.C.	Not the business done abroad by the U.K. firms.



H.D.	Hive off the overseas branch.



G.S.	Diff. to do.  S. African is large:  part of D. Long organn – tho’ they buy their steel fr. S. African cos. they are part of U.K. organn.



A.B.	Useful experiment for public Corpn to own overseas assets etc.



R.S.C.	V. diff. legally.  Tho’ you cd. get round those diffies with S. Afr. Govt.



A.	In H/L it became clear tht. Corpn will have v. complex job.  They must succeed.  Don’t increase their diffies if you can avoid it.

	Let them hive off.



P.M.	Don’t take over a part of an industry fortuitously.



R.S.C.	a) Dorman Long, not the Corpn, wd. be running it.

	b) In structural steel, diffies in standards, experimental work etc.

		Advantages if we had control over some firm – to get progress made in these directions.



E.B.	M/E. capital development:  much structural steel will be needed:

		Also developmts. in India &amp; Pakistan.  How wd. this be affected?



R.S.C.	No diffy. in contractg.  Diffy. if you try to establish local branch.



A.W.	If hived off, D. Long wd. be free to buy foreign steel.



G.S.	Yes.



A.B.	Consumers of structural steel are unduly at mercy of producers.



E.B.	Don’t like breakg. up integrated organisation.



H.W.	Against hiving off.



C.J.	Against hiving off.



			Agreed:  Don’t hive this off.

				[Exit G.S.



3.	     Gold Coast Constitution.



C.J.	As in memo.

	Main ques.:  shd. Legn Council be able to control Executive?



E.B.	Is there a period set; at end of wh. this posn will be reviewed?

		That wd. make it much easier to meet criticism in U.N.



P.M.	Unsound.  For people think then only of end of period &amp; won’t try to work existg. system.  This is unsound principle &amp; we wd. oppose it.



C.J.	C.O. always opposed to it.



			Memo. approved.





4.	     Political Activities of Civil Servants.



R.S.C.	What Whitley Council really want is to attack principles of Rpt.

	If we depart from main lines, we shall have to start all over again &amp; accept political odium.



P.M.	Trouble is that old rules were not observed in practice.



H.M.	Strong feelings in Parly. Party against this-

i)	because people who have bn. engaging in activities are to be ruled out.

ii)	Many activities diff. to object to.

iii)	banning people from taking office.

	Some Party members are beginning to resign.

	Believe we shd. consider again where this line shd. be drawn.



H.D.	Support H.M.

a)	G.P.O. – what harm in this – might have bn a Corpn.

b)	Man who had bn. Chairman of Harrow Council.

		Rules evidently haven’t bn. properly enforced.



R.S.C.	Remember tht. we announced acceptance of Rpt.

	Agitation by Staff assocns:  they want complete freedom.



P.M.	We thght. this Rpt. was extension.  Now find tht., as rules not enforced, it is a contraction.

	There is much agitation afoot.



G.A.I.	Wd. have serious effects e.g. in L. Govt. adminn in Ldn.



R.S.C.	You cd. say you won’t disturb G.P.O. practice.  But can’t muddle about with line of demarcation.

	Remember that Rpt. frees 450.000 new people.

		Decisions suspended.  Next Cabinet.
