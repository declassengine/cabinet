C.M. 10 (50)					13th March, 1950



1.	    Parliament.   Housing.

				   [Enter H.G., W.W.

A.B.	Diffies of housing emphasised in debate on Address.

	Good case for increasg. housing of p’mme because increased prodn – wh. justifies enlargemt. of investment p’mme.

	Much private distress, but also economic disutility, because housg. shortage.

		Evidenced by demands fr. Supply Dpts for extra housing in particular areas.

	Wise therefore to put it back to 200.000 houses a year.

		Also to let it run at that level for some time.

		Because of 1947 crisis we haven’t reached 200.000 – tho’ we shall this year because adminve steps taken to accelerate in 1949.

	We are in fact bldg. more than we take credit for.

	R.S.C. may say – 1 yr’s lag:  you are now spkg. of 1951.  But I believe tht. in 1951 necessities &amp; expansn of prodn will demand 200.000.

	If this is agreed, want liberty to promise houses for sale up to one in five.  No l.a. to give more w’out prior investign.



H.McN.	Around 24/25.000 for Scotland.  Wd. that be accepted?  By M/H.

		On private bldg. want to reserve my posn.  I wd. prefer to say we will do it for key classes – e.g. teachers, farm-workers etc.



R.S.C.	No argument in favour of reversg. our decn to reduce investmt. p’mme.

		£35 m. – 25.000 houses – was cut we agreed on.  Will come down to that in ’51.

	Apart from electoral reasons, no ground for change.

	If we did it, we shd. have to seek cuts in investmt. elsewhere.

	It will be obvious tht. we are doing it for electoral reasons.



H.W.	Trouble with investmt. p’mme = things in our control take the knock:  private sector gets away with it.

		cf. vehicles going too much into house market.

		Esp. awkward since public = political sector.

	Can we now increase controls over private building?  Takes resources away fr. housing &amp; swells investmt p’mme.



R.S.C.	We went into all this on Investmt. P’mme.

	No economic reason to vary our decision.

	

A.B.	Is it good econ. planning to put bldg. workers out of emplt?



H.M.	i) Firm statement was made in genl. economic debate.

	ii) All Dpts. had to take cuts – hard that one shd. escape now.

	iii) M/H. said he cd. make the cut fall wholly outside l.a. p’mme.



A.B.	Don’t w’draw on iii):  but it reduces total house-building.

		And some l.a.’s were not giving any “private” licences.

H.D.	Don’t favour snap decision w’out pp.

	But cdn’t Minister give some hope – w’out commitment.

	Housing was a headache in the Election.

	Re-consider priorities of investmt. &amp; give more to l.a. p’mme.

		Have revised my view on this because pressure in Election.

		Let I.P. Cttee consider this.  Let M/H. say to-day we are lookg. into it again.



R.S.C.	Current review of investmt. p’mme shows increased demand fr. all quarters, and no more resources.

	Misleading to suggest tht. on economic grds. there will be any hope of finding means of increasg. housing’s share of investment.



A.	Trouble = rising costs of bldg.



A.B.	Costs have risen less than wholesale index.



H.M.	Inefficiency of bldg. industry.



G.A.I.	Amount of human suffering.  Long waiting lists.  Bombed areas.

		Most do somethg. to ease that.



A.V.A.	Food &amp; raw materials come first, however.  And daren’t risk undermining our capacity to import those.



A.B.	200.000 p.a. is not a v. ambitious level.  Rate of obsolescence is now v. high.

	Addl houses = direct contn to econ. recovery in terms of greater mobility of labour.



R.S.C.	But can’t veer round, after 3 months, and eat all our words.

		Shows we are incompetent to govern.



H.M.	The margin involved in going back to 200.000 isn’t big enough to make any political difference.  Complaints won’t be any less at next election.



A.B.	Under-occupn by old + over crowdg. by young.



G.W.	Cd. be solved by transfers if landlords wd. agree.  Cd. powers be taken to compel this?



A.B.	Discussed on Housg. Adv. Cttee.

a)	Can get it done w’in l.a. housing estates.  Going well.

b)	Bldg. for old people. Trouble = reluctance of aged to move.

c)	Houses in private ownership – no powers.

	Agree with H.M.  Not much political advantage to be gained by this margin of increase.



P.M.	Fallacy in all this = calculations based on assumption tht. there was a time when people were properly housed.  There wasn’t in fact.  Housing condns are much better than they were.

		But standards have risen &amp; demand goes on increasing.



			Agreed:  No change to be announced.

			               Re-consider on next I.P.C. report.





	Business for next week.



H.M.	Wed.  Transport (vice Control of Engagement).

	Leave 2nd spkr open.

	Thurs.  Defence.  E.Sh. &amp; P.M. to wind up.

			                                                           [Enter B., G.S. &amp; N.B.

			                                                           [Exit W.W.

2.	    Transport:  Increase of Charges.



B.	Commn’s appln supported by Tribunal.  My own view co-incides.

No further source of revenue in sight to balance increased costs.  Must stop deficit accumulating.

		Last 12 mos.  Commn have bn. takg. over road haulage – from April onwds. they will have complete control save for l. licences.

	Area control.  Pol. sitn has moved r. us &amp; we may have to change tactics.  N.E. scheme is almost ready:  will be v. diff. to put it thro’ new Parlt. under special Orders procedure.

	Now this passes outside Govt. control – into Tribunal’s sphere.

		Mustn’t weaken its authy at outset.

	Earlier Cab. discn: co-ordn of road and rail.  Have circulated Hurcomb’s reply.  Don’t like it.  An increasg. pressure on him.   But it’s not lack of capital resources tht. delays him (so Ty. can’t help.)



H.M.	May be raised in H/C. on Wed.

	Don’t see eye to eye with M/T.

	V. important issues.  Consoln &amp; improvemt. of existg. natns is proved by this to be essential.

	Transport Tribunal has not done its job.  L.P.T.B. have gone ahead:  w’out giving Ministers a chance.  Awkward fare increased for 10 m. people in October!

		Tribunal shd. have enquired

a.	economy

b.	effect on basic industries.  Para 4 (b) of memo.  But Rpt. shows Tribunal accepted Commn’s say so on (a):  p.13.

	Independence of Corpns is being overdone.  Here we are, unable to judge wtr. Commn is economical.

	Shdn’t P.M. ask Unions to say when economies cd. be made.

	On b). Tribunal dodged it, too.  No argument – p. ?

		I wd. favour p’ponement for 9 – 12 months – in interests of other industries.  Let Commn carry deficit m’while.

	My conclusion:  in view of unsatisf. nature of report (and because annoyance over L.T.P.B. run-away) &amp; genl. econ situation, I favour p’ponement.



P.M.	Agree.

	We believe in road/rail co-ordn.

	Effect of this will be to push even more on to roads.

		Negation of planning.



B.	Charges Scheme procedure is laid down in Act.  B.T.C. is requd to put it’s scheme to Tribunal.



H.M.	But on common sense Corpn shd. go to Minister if there’s likely to be a row.



N.B.	Effect on my natd industries.

		Share view of H.M. &amp; P.M.

	Tribunal admits it will affect c/living etc.,  £4-7 on cars for export.

			N.C.B. say 1/6 p. ton overall:  3/= in Ldn.

			Elec. say 11/3 m. more – to go to consumer

			Gas say 2 m. more – to go to consumer

		Homes &amp; factories will suffer.

	Long-term = worse.  The trouble with rlways = losing traffic to roads.  This will increase that tendency.

		C licence vehicles up to 770.000 from 300.000 odd pre-war.

		This increase is aid in Rpt. to be likely to drive £10 m. traffic to roads.

	We must face road/rail problem.  Or rlways. will be derelict.

	Some countries (Canada) carry permanent Budget deficit for rlways.  Right to carry this pro tem.



A.V.A.	Far-reachg. economic consequences.

		Increased competn fr. C. licences is v. disturbing.

	P.14 of Rpt. shows gravity of consequences.

	Favour p’ponement.



H.W.	a) Unknown factor.  Until Budget is known can’t know wtr. there will be any change in relative profitability of road &amp; rail.

		Admd already peak for passenger fares has bn. reached.

		May be reachg. it on goods.

b)	Rpt. doesn’t suggest economies have bn. exhausted.

P.8.  Not many indies show so badly on productivity.

c)	Hurcomb’s promise to work out basic rate for traffic from point A to Point B irrespective of wtr. it goes by road or by rail.  How quickly will that come in?



B.	In 2 years.



H.W.	d) How much affected by amortisation provns in Transport Act?



B.	Not much.  Only £2-3 m.



H.D.	Support H.M.

	Not impressive Rpt.  Narrow view when broad view needed.

		V. bad moment for such a decn.  – just before road haulage is taken over in Apl.



R.S.C.	Raises large issue of subsidising natd indies.

	Sooner or later we shall be asked to pay some of deficit.

	May be better not to insist tht. natd services shall always run at a profit.

	Are we ready to subsidise them, at some stage?  By refusing rate increases you share in responsibility.  Might be a long-term loan to cover initial expendre.

	V. unsatisf. Rpt.  But this Tribunal will never enquire into efficiency of rlways. – unless contestants bring up sufftly specific points.  Their verdict is therefore only “not proven”.

		Hope rlways. can come up to genl. average of 21/2% increase in productivity.  Their present estimate, 1% or so, is fantastically low.

	Won’t object to p’ponemt. – even if it does involve some implied liability to help in one way or another at later stage.

	Find a basis for p’ponement.  On condn tht. effective pressure for efficiency can be applied.



E.Sh.	Agree.  But consider diffy. of Ministers responsible for natd industies.  Submns made by Corpns for increased charges.

		M/T must refer these to Tribunal.  They report. What can Ministers do then?

	What is needed is overhaul of financial posn of natd industies.

		They need to be integrated.



H.G.	Choice of evils.

	But delay means v. large accumulation of deficit.  Any real hope tht. rlways. will even pay their way on present charges.

	You will only p’pone evil day – unless you are ready to subsidise, wh. I myself shd. deprecate.

	Basic trouble – apart fr. road/rail ques. – is tht. their costs have risen far more than charges.



P.M.	Cab. is unwilling to authorise these increases to-day.

		Must look round this.



B.	Govt. policy has aggravated diffies of rlways.

	May I submit a diff. memo.?



P.M.	Yes:  with a memo. on how to put transport generally upon a sound financial footing.



H.M.	What can B. say on Wedy?



J.	Transport (both sides) must pay its way.  But roads must help rail.



P.M.	Let M/T. stall on Wedy. on ground that this is not moment for policy decln or decn when road haulage is going to be taken over in April.  And repercussions must be considered … haven’t had much time since Election.





3.	    National Health Service.

				[Exit B., G.S., N.B.

			                                                          [Enter E. Summerskill

A.B.	……

a) Avoid bureaucratic &amp; centralised control.

b)	Don’t be defeated over charges.



R.S.C.	Serious ques. is:  are we in control of our expre?

		Any Govt. wh. comes fwd. with 50% Suppl. is bound to show how it proposes to re-assert control.

	We are much more likely to fall because this than because not spending enough.

	What can a C/Ex. say?

i)	A ceiling must be put on this Service.  We must find means of ensuring tht. there is not Suppl. next year.

ii)	Either estimating or the expenditure must be unsatisfactory.

Can’t pretend all poss. is being done to control waste &amp; rate of developmt. of  Service.

		Method of financing has not proved satisfy. – &amp; we intend to improve more M/H. control at various stages.  Must go into that.  I want to say that at once.  A.B. wants to wait until it emerges from enquiries already procedg.

	Ques. then arises – ultimate limit of expre.  We originally thght in terms of £200m.  Now it’s around £400 m.  Is this a fair share of Budget?  If not, shd. we not take steps now to charge for some services.  Must decide this between Tuesd. &amp; Budget. – tho’ admit we can’t decide it before Tuesday.

	Want now authy to say i) and ii) when I speak to-morrow.



A.	V. disapptg. sitn.  Hope enquiries will lead to quick practical remedies.

		2/3rds of cost = hospitals &amp; specialists.  Some hosp. Bds. in enthusiasm are unjustifiably extravagant - &amp; can’t be controlled at present.

		Must be controlled.

	Paymt. of specialists – esp. juniors.  Excessive. Revision needed.

	I favour announcg. in principle tht. we favour stricter financial control.

	Don’t like charges.  Doubt if they are necessary.

	Will R.S.C. get much comfort out of (i).



A.B.	Dental services may cost £40 m.  Suppose we find more want to use it.  Must I stop them?



R.S.C.	You have other elements in service to save on.  Or you cd. introduce charge.



H.M.	Broad issue.  Cost has increased.  Is out of control.

		Can country afford this?  One service can’t be left in posn tht. we have to foot the bill whatever the cost.

	Shd. be a ceiling.  R.S.C. shd. state it.  We shd. stick to it.

	The local control shd. be exercised by officers apptd by Minister.



H.D.	When I agreed to this system

		a) we assumed early costing system

		b) I assumed a M.H. watchdog.  M.H. repve on Hosp. Bd. seems 	minimum.  Why does A.B. resist this?



A.B.	I’m not resistg. it.  I’m proposing it.  But don’t want it bounced out in H/C. w’out consultn.



P.M.	1. Must be a ceiling.

	2. Must be some effective control over finances.

		Nothg. new.  Anyone with experience on hospitals Cttee is used to financial control.



H.D.	White list of drugs.  Shd. be black list too – incldg. free cotton wool &amp; aspirin.



H.McN.	No objn to R.S.C.’s i) and ii).

	But care re ceiling.  Can it be absolute?  e.g. effects of increased rlway freights.



R.S.C.	W’in £400 m. these sort of increases can be absorbed – by economies somewhere.



H.M.	How can Prison Estimates get over this diffy.  They do.



E.S.	Unless R.S.C. makes some such statement, the responsible people in the Hospital world will think we are irresponsible.

		They want people on these Bds. who are watchg. the financial position.
