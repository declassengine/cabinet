C.M. 7 (50)					3rd March, 1950



1.	    Bechuanaland:  Chieftainship of Bamangwato Tribe.



G.W.	Seen once:  v. unlikely to agree to w’draw voluntarily.  Seeing him again to-day:  will try:   don’t expect to succeed.

	New idea:  p’pone recogn for 5 yrs.  H. Commr. unhappy but thinks he cd. just wear it.  Want authy to suggest this at right moment.

	He may bolt back.  Can’t stop him leaving.  But can stop him entering at other end.  Want authy to warn him of this &amp; do it. With authy to say it’s Cab. decn.  Wd. then put in another memo. on wider ques.



A.	First decn:  are we willing to recognise him as Chief.  Last decn was only to ask him to w’draw.  Now likely tht. he will refuse.

	5 yrs delay: alternative to plain decision.

	My view:  we can’t have him as Chief.



J.G.	No views.



P.M.	This is best way out of diff. situation.



A.B.	Thought he was Chief. 



P.M.	No:  election has to approved by H.M.G.



A.B.	India’s views:  G.W. Govt’s not known.  Krishna’s own view is tht. blank refusal wd. cause trouble in India:  delay wd. be preferable.



G.W.	He wants decision imposed on him – even if it’s p’ponement.



			Agreed: authority to p’pone (viz. can’t recognise him at

			              present: he can’t return for 5 years subject to 

			              review of period:  allowance to be condl on his

			              not intriguing:  Tshekedi not to return either.)

			Memo to come up next wk. on publn of report etc.





2.	    Financial Situation.



R.S.C.	My genl. talk:  other’s views on Mon:  later my proposals to whatever body of Ministers P.M. may decide.

	Genl. posn.  Estimates exceeded on both sides, as last year.

		Revenue v. buoyant:  over £4 billion (4000 m) Inland Rev. Customs, Surpl. stores, trading services, &amp; misc. – all up £153.m. more than Estimate:  above line.

		Expenditure.  Suppl. Est. appear to cover.  £150 more &amp; there will be off-setting items not mentioned at this stage.  I shan’t mention these publicly.  Civil:  88 m. increase.  Defence – down 20m.

		10 m. excess on Consol. Fund Services.  Total increase £78 m.

		Surplus above line £75 m. more than expected – at £545 m.

		Below the line:  Trouble with l.a.’s who anticipated loans &amp; invested at higher interest – 75 m. before we stopped it.  Total expre £579 m.  r. receipts £76 m.  Net surplus overall £40 m  as r. £14 m wh. we budgeted for.  Favourable out-turn.

	For 1950/51.  Estimated receipts lower than this yr’s actual.  50 m. up on Estimated but 150 m. below actual.  (One reason:  remission of tax on machinery will come in this coming year).

	Expre 150 m. above cst. or 71 above actual for last.

		Surplus above line 200 m. less than last year.

	Fwd. figures for next 2 yrs. to ’53:  trend 100 m. less surplus in 51/52:  a rise in 52/53 – assuming same taxation &amp; tht. over 3 yrs. rise of 220 m. (?) in expre, mostly automatic.

	Below line:   little altern. save w. damage for p.u.’s paid in full (62 m) &amp; finished.  Other w. dam. runs on at 100 m. next yr. &amp; then tails off.  L.A. loans put at 280 m all thro’.

		Total 518 m. next yr. v. 70 m receipts:  Net deficit 448 m.

		Overall deficit 84 m. or against surplus of 40 this year.



						[Exit C.E.

R.S.C.	Inflationary – genl. econ. sitn.

		Depends on

a)	total prodn.

b)	total Govt. expre

c)	capital requd. for investment.

	In 49/50 £2.210 m. for c).  Assumg. no cut in Govt. Expre of any significance (Most we can do is stop increase) main easement is c).  Can’t do much on private consumptn for that wd. involve reducg. wages.  And rising prices means increase of 3-4%.  Assumg. private savings as last year &amp; Budget surplus 200 m. less, we shall be about 200 m. short of what is requd for investment.  Increased infl. pressure if Budget were same wd. be betwn 100/150 m. p.a.  No one suggests accuracy w’in 100 m.  My own view:  we shdn’t be departg. fr. disinflationary policy if we repeated last yr’s Budget &amp; tried no more.  But no latitude for any concessions unless balanced by new taxn.  Haven’t gone into this:  but sources of new money have bn combed pretty well already.  One obvious possibility = petrol tax, but gt. Diffies with farmers and forces.



P.M.	Conservative estimates of increased prodn?



R.S.C.	Under-estimated last year at 21/2% - out-turn 3-4%.  Propose 21/2 again because large part of increase was in vehicles &amp; we can’t assume it again or allow it because home v. export.  Can’t go above estimate of 3%.

	Over 3 yrs. at 21/2% increase wd. be £800 m.  Each 1% = £300 m.



H.D.	They have under-estimated for several years.

R.S.C.	Only twice.  But unwise to take optimistic estimates on our side.



H.M.	And gt. pol. Diffies if found to have over-estimated seriously.



R.S.C.	And a 1% rise in prices takes £85 m. right away.  And the income fr. increased prodn is quite beyond direction.

	Also:  deficit 70/80 m. on overseas paymt. this year.  Hope next yr. to be in surplus.  Means £120 m. to be provided fr. extra prodn.

		Not much scope in prodn to do more than meet requiremts. for increased investment.  Not much of it can be cut.



A.	Investment?



R.S.C.	Much of it is housing, schools etc.

	Private sector = £450 m.  But about £310 m. in unascertained equipmt. etc., much of wh. is for private industry.



E.Sh.	What increase in prodn fr mechanisation?



R.S.C.	Can’t say – tho’ it’s because of this tht. we assume contd rise in productivity.

		No more to come from man-power &amp; r. materials supply.



E.B.	Shan’t be able to hold wages.



R.S.C.	T.U.C. – Econ. Cttee not comg. to see me because no more to be said.

		They said don’t want any help fr. Budget.

		Can’t hold wages more than a few months.  But nothg. your weak Govt. cd. do in Budget wd. help us.  Only strong action v profits.



E.B.	Expect big strikes end/April.  Pol. leaders:  but support because economic grievance.



R.S.C.	Approach.  2 main dangers

a)	Wages going up sharply.

b)	Budgeting for insuff. surplus &amp; not being able to meet investmt. needs.

b)	won’t be so urgent but effects as serious.

	We must decide wh. danger is greater.  And is it worth risking b) to avoid a).  If moderate increase in allowances or redn in taxn you cd. prevent a) you cd. make adjustmt. in Budget in one part way wh. wd. give you money for that purpose.



A.B.	Cd. war credits be released to people under £6 a wk.



R.S.C.	So fortuitous tht. it wdn’t help.  So many people haven’t got such credits.



A.B.	Argument.  Rich can live on capital.  Why can’t poor?

		Cd. we not add another class, to the aged?

J.G.	Wdn’t help the young – who are most active in T.U.’s.



R.S.C.	But first how do we collect the money?  Only by takg. larger l.a.’s out of Local Loans Fund &amp; force them on to market.  That wd. support gilt-edged market:  &amp; Bank wd. like it.  But wdn’t give new money:  &amp; wd. risk inflation because shortage				          [Re-enter C.E.

		of that amount as v. inflation – tho’ it wd. help Budget.



E.B.	Wages.  Psych. sitn. wh. won’t be affected by Budgetary action.

		We have gone on too long – prices haven’t dropped.

	Increased prodivity has affected earnings, for they do less over-time.

		Man’s weekly pay has dropped because increased productivity.  Believe it applies throughout engineering:  &amp; much of ship-bldg.  Getting what they need in 44 hrs.  When that was introduced first it gave men increased earnings because over-time.  Better organn has removed need for over-time.

	Standards have risen.  Television is now a 			[Enter J.

		necessity.

	Must face wage increase.  Can be moderate if handled wisely.

		But if you insist on freeze, there will be serious breakaway.

	Missed the boat for alternatives (fam. allowces etc) when we de-valued.

		No good trying that now.

	Irritating odds &amp; ends cd. be removed. War credits is one.  I found it pressed only in relation to deaths.  



R.S.C.	Wd. cost 40 m. for we shd. have to go back over past deaths.



E.B.	Needs studying with human approach.  Don’t snap at me.

	Cdn’t you spread it, even on deaths?  Deaths over 50 as 1st step.

		At least that wd. be a beginning.  Hope R.S.C. will consider this.



H.D.	Not much profit in this.

	Won’t help those you want to help most – unless you put an income limit on it.



G.T.	Disabled who won’t work again.  Cd. we not give them theirs?



J.G.	a) Wages.  Agree with E.B.  T.U.C. can’t hold it much longer.

		We must create psych. favourable to T.U.C.  Wdn’t rule out yet increase in fam. allowances - &amp; drawing something for young un-married man by tax relief’s.  That wd. moderate claims even if freeze broken down.  Favour further discns of this with T.U.C.

c)	Pressure to raise Assistce Scales.  Bd. is divided on this, Chairman favouring increase.  Believe Bd. will come along with proposals for increase.



G.A.I.	Support E.B.’s view on wages.  We shd. have had gt. diffy. in holding this if we had returned with strong majority.  Now they say”  you won’t be able to do anything, why shd. we wait?

	6 disputes a day reported to me at M/L.

		We can’t control posn.  We can steer twds. arbitration:  but then awards must be accepted.  Men haven’t lost faith in arbitration because they know Govt. haven’t directed it to reject claims.

	The big industries are on the move.  Others will follow.

	Can’t see any spectacular means by wh. this pressure can be stopped.



P.M.	Redn of earnings (E.B.) = redn of inflationary pressure?



R.S.C.	No. For increase of prices cancels it out.



T.W.	1/4th of workers are likely to get 10% increase.  That forces up c/living.



R.S.C.	And increases costs of exports.



H.M.	Growing gloom.  If we let things drift, we head for an economic smash.  Bad for country - &amp; for us too, for years to come.

	Can we have real facts of wages.  Not merely impressions.

		How far is loss of over-time balanced by piece-rates.

		How far are new claims justified  e.g. bus-men.

	Worth trying economic education.

	Are dpts. holding prices?  Cd. they do more?

	Budget is final touch to economic planning &amp; must use it as means of checkg. inflation.  Must save for investment on Budget (saves interest).  Research in industry must expand.

	No scope here for increased expre.  Or for concessions.  Looks like stand-still Budget.  What sources of new money?

	Must go on increasg. ind. efficiency.  Power per worker is still only 50% of what it is in U.S.  Private cos. funds shd. be mobilised for this.

	Keep in mind genl. Econ. posn &amp; danger of fatal trends – esp. if we have failed to warn workers.



E.Sh	i) Agree.  But assume E.B. is right on wages &amp; strikes follow.  Loss of prodn from that cause wd. cost you even more.

	ii) Case for some increase in lower-paid workers’ wages.  They have to work full week to get that wage.  Piece-workers are better off.

		Sure lower-paid will get somethg. – as they did last year.

		Better, however, to do it thro’ budget than thro’ wage increase alone. Might avert crisis under a).

	What cd. be done.  P-war credits &amp; fair allce perhaps.  But I think concessions shd. be incentives to prodn.   E.g. No P.A.Y.E. on over-time:  reducg. income tax on lower-paid groups.



R.S.C.	(They don’t pay any.)



H.D.	Assume a stand-still Budget.  But try + and – method.  E.g. tax reliefs combined with increased profits tax &amp; death duties.  Laying burden on idle elements &amp; profiteers.

	Tax reliefs.  Simple course is best.  Increased earned income relief – is ¼ vice 1/5.  Helps young man.  Or thro’ allowances &amp; increase them. 



R.S.C.	Or reduce the smaller early rate (3/6)

	By such a + and -, you wd. be creatg. psych. atmosph. moderatg. wage claims.



A.	Can we have more informn re £2.210 m. cap. investment.



R.S.C.	Look in Econ. Survey.  It’s all there.  App. to last year’s. XX.



A.B.	Agree with E.B. on wages.

	Genl. Electn results haven’t helped – because geograph. divn.  This marks industl worker, who believes he has shown restraint while profits have gone sky-high.

	What about past concessions e.g. on fixed investment.  Employer now getting prodn in 44 hr week.  But that means unecon. use of machinery – only 71/2 days a wk.  Seen that in mines – but now double shifting, at last.  Best way of increasing prodn is by increased use of existg. plant.  This is how U.S. has done it.  This = worst social failure of B. capitalist.



H.M.	Is blame all to employers.  E.g. cotton.



R.S.C.	Also, more houses for more workers.



A.B.	Aim shd. be to moderate wage claims.  Best way to do this = Budget concessions.  Must resist increase in wages in public sector (apart fr. miners).  [Means apparently black-coated worker.]

	On c/living more courageous attack needed on monopoly prices.

		Shall open up on that in debate on my Suppl. Estimate.



H.W.	C/living was a main issue at Election.  And some 			[Exit H.M.

		prices bound to rise.  Now workg. on monopolies, retail price maintenance &amp; protn of consumers on quality.  But it’s fruit &amp; veg. prices tht. cause most irritn.  Controls removed.  Shd. have a further report.  That’s best point of impact on c/living.

	Petrol.  In discn on Austr. it was said we might have to de-ration if Austr. ratted.



R.S.C.	Wd. cost 50 m. $ to de-ration.



P.M.	Unexpected exports.  Increase inflation.

	

R.S.C.	 Net deficit only £70 m. last year.



G.T.	A.B.’s “secondary” labour, wh. he thinks shd. suffer.

		If wages begin to move, can’t delay teachers’ claim for more than 12 months.  On merits - &amp; ignoring relativities.

R.S.C.	Many of these secondary wages are fixed in relation to industrial rates.



G.T.	I wd. argue tht. lower-paid black-coated class have bn. harder hit than any class.  



R.S.C.	Dissented.



E.B.	Must also face contns taken under Insurance &amp; used for other purposes.  Contns aren’t justified by needs of scheme itself.

		There’s going to be trouble over this.



J.G.	There is substantial balance – because Fund based on 8% unemplt.



E.B.	Calculn based on assumed poss. of unemplt. &amp; sickness.

		Socialist policies have resulted in less than assumed.



R.S.C.	We were keeping the balance r. the day when we cd. reduce contn rates in deflationary situation.
