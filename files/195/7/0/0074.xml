C.M. 11(50).				16th March, 1950.



	1.	National Health Service.	[Enter  W.W.



A.B.	Left that R.S.C. wd. use form of words acceptable to me.  He did.

		That finished it.

	Why was concln (2) included?



R.S.C.	Because I had raised ques. of charges &amp; wanted it discussed before

		Budget.



E.B.	Also lack of Cab. control over expre on Service.  M/H. &amp; Ty. &amp; no

		chance of Cab. exercising any control.  Thought that also was

		to be considered.



R.S.C.	That shd. be O.K. now.  No diff. fr. any other service.



P.M.	Was Cab. view tht. charges shd. be discussed again.



R.S.C.	And before Budget.



H.M.	And any future developmt. in Service shd. come to Cab. or Cttee in

		future.



R.S.C.	Yes:  if outside ceiling.





	2.	Parliament.



H.M.	Business for next week.

	Mon. – Wed.  Rule will be suspended, but sittings will end by

		mid-night.

		No divn on motion to suspend.



E.Sh.	May be trouble on Air Estimates, wh. might lead to a division.

		Sale of jet aircraft.  (W.S.C.)



H.M.	Whips shd. try to relieve Ministers from attendance so late.



	Seretse Khama.



H.M.	Cl. Davies spoke to me before tabling Motion.  Told him I cdn’t find

		time – W.S.C. might give it a Supply Day – cautioned him 

		v. tabling it.  Then found they had done it already.  He wasn’t 

		v. serious about it.

	I must refuse to give time for it.



A.B.	V. diff. to refuse.  Issue of 1st class importance.



H.M.	Can’t accept votes of censure from 9 members.  Only fr. Official

		Opposn.



	Corporal Punishment.



A.	Motion for next week.  19 Peers already askg. to speak.

	What line?



H.M.	Commons too?



P.M.	Fully debated on C.J. Bill &amp; Govt. not prepd to depart at moment fr.

		policy then pursued.



C.E.	No divn on this in H/Commons.  Govt. defeated in H/L.  On

		re-inserting it in H/C. we were supported by prominent Tories

		incldg. Peake &amp; Elliott.

	No evce of increase in crimes of violence.  But public attentn because

		of speeches by Judges.





	3.	Divorce.



P.M.	Lipton’s Ques.  Has bn. put down again.



T.W.	Betting &amp; Cap. Punishment – two are enough.



G.W.	Intense feeling in limited circle.



R.S.C.	Will raise religious issue.  Surely unwise to present time.



P.M.	Continue to stall.





4.	Council of Europe.



P.M.	Repn ended with end of Parlt.  New delegn can’t be apptd until next

		Council.  But Cttees running.

	We propose to reduce our repn on Delegn, pro tem.  1 + 1.  And

		adjust at Council, giving Liberals right to nominate one, as now

		no Independents.



A.B.	Will new names (for apptmt by Council) come to Cabinet?



P.M.	Yes.		                                    [Exit  W.W.   Enter  N. Edwds.





	5.	Staff Associations in Post Office.



N.E.	Agreed by Cab.   i)   not to recognise break-away Unions.

			          ii)  abandon Listowel formula.

	Paling formula involves 2 rows in H/C.  a) on meaning of imprecise

		formula &amp; b) on refusal to recognise breakaway Union.

	I wd. prefer to have dispute over action not words.  Hence my 			formula.  It is line with practice in other Dpts.  It keeps Dpt. out 		of rows with Unions.



P.M.	But you say no break-away Union has a chance unless Union agrees.

		And you transfer right of recognn fr. employer to Union.



N.E.	Must support rights of majority of workers.  And must keep Dpt. out

		of these rows.



P.M.	Repudiate employer’s obligns.   And leave everything to majority.



G.A.I.         	a)	Against brk-away Unions in principle.  But earlier formula 			suffices (App. E. to earlier memo.).  We are safest on this line.

                   	b)	Recognn as negotiatg. body is for employer.  But recognn as 

		constituent part of Whitley Council is for other Unions.

		Having decided to adopt App. E., we shd. stand on that.  Means 		that on the facts we shan’t be recognising brk. away Union.



R.S.C.	Agree with G.A.I.  Employer can’t divest himself of responsibility.

		Makes it more diff. for him to exercise it finally if he gives it

		intermediately to other Unions.  P.M.G. will be better off if he

		adheres to earlier decn.



A.B.	Various Ministers affected.  If Minister takes respons. for assemblg.

		staff side of Whitley, he will be in trouble.  Med. Pract. Union

		affiliated to T.U.C:  I have had to refrain fr. putting them in –

		on ground tht. I don’t settle who are to be repves of employees.

	Support N.E.’s view.



J.G.	Twelve months’ ago, as Chairman of Party,  I recd depn fr. 

		P.O. Unions that 40% rule favoured splintering.  They then 

		intended to raise this at Party Conference.  Persuaded them not

		to – for all Unions wd. back it.

		Risk that repves of big P.O. Unions may boy-cott Whitley 			Council.  Support N.E. on that ground.



E.B.	Origin of 40% rule?



N.E.	C. Service practice, slightly modified by Listowel formula. 



P.M.	Can’t ignore past history.



E.B.	Why limit this P.O?  Doesn’t this apply to whole Service.



R.S.C.	New P.O. developments have led to new grades - &amp; new opporties of

		forming new small Unions.

	Agree that this does need considering on a broader basis.



E.B.	Need for some general principle applicable throughout.

	Bringing all Civil Service in will strengthen workers’ opinion

		v. breakaway Unions.

	Two posns  i)  repn on Whitley Council.  Shares in negotns.  But

			ii) can Minister refuse to meet leaders of another Union

			    wh. represents substantial no. e.g. on individual case.

		V. diff. for any public authy to refuse ii).

	P.M.G.’s announcemt., when it comes shd. be made with Cab. authy as

		something applicable throughout Service.



A.B.	E.B.’s ii) cd. be met by adjustment of para. (4) of Appendix.



R.S.C.	If we are going to try to regularise position, we shd. try to do it

		throughout Service.



E.B.	And policy shd. be announced by some Minister other than P.M.G.



H.M.	Cd. the Nat. Whitley Council have a look at it?

	Don’t want Govt. criticised for denying freedom of assocn.



R.S.C.	Whitley = sitting tenants.  Parti pris.  Govt. must decide.



P.M.	[Cab.] Cttee to examine &amp; report quickly to Cabinet.



G.T.	Look at this qua functions not grades.



R.S.C.       x/	Ty. to take the lead.  Cttee of Establ. Officers to report to Cttee of

		Ministers.

			Agreed:  as at x/.	[Exit  N.E.

				 Enter  H.G.



	6.	Economic Survey. 1950.



P.M.           	i)  No mention of sterling balances.



R.S.C.	Unwise to mention because no decision.

		Doesn’t come into picture anyway.



P.M.	Surely it does.  Workers slaving away for this as unrequited exports.

		Affects living standards of our workers.



H.D.	We shdn’t have a gap on this.



H.G.	At bottom of p.10 we cd. insert some innocuous phrases –

		after para. 59.		Agreed.



A.B.       	ii)  Housing.  Prodn Cttee suspended discn because I intended to raise it 

	      in Cab.  I did, w’out effect.  But now consider p. 28 - &amp; effect on

	      public opinion.  Don’t ask for decision, but utter warning.  This 

	      is grim reading in Election year.  Esp. Scotland.

	Shall put in memo. showg. allocn &amp; how it will work out.



A.            	iii)  Purpose of Survey.  Does it commit us?



R.S.C.	No.



A.	Cd. the English be made more intelligible?



R.S.C.	No:  this is for technical people.  cf. p.7:  para. 38.



E.B.	Para. 9.  Reference to U.S. depression.  Is it wise?



R.S.C.	Have accepted F.O. amendment.



H.M.	Para. 42.  And para. 112-114.  Is enough money being spent on

		improvemts. in plant &amp; productivity?  Isn’t this

		over-optimistic.



R.S.C.	Decided on I.P.C. report.  Will come up on their next rpt.

		Genl. view:  over-generous in private sector.



A.B.	Under-employmt. of machinery – failure to work more than one shift.



G.T.	Man-power not sufficient.



A.B.	Yes:  if less efficient plants were closed, &amp; available men were moved

		to efficient machinery.



R.S.C.	Just a few social problems involved.



H.M.	Para. 75. amendment – p. 3 of memo.  Over-optimistic.

	Also para. 11 on p. 4 of memo.



R.S.C.	I support that.



H.M.	Table re Scotland.  Won’t it look v. small.



R.S.C.	This covers only cases where sep. Scottish Dpt.

		Otherwise para. 50 is all you can do.



H.McN.	I’m content.



P.M.	Edn tables on p. 29.



H.W.	Para 64 (p. 31).  Avoid “control” as implying N.I. can control it

		and we can’t.









	7.	Bamangwato Tribe.



G.W.	Boycott of Kwotla.  Organised by 7 Africans and one European

		recruited for S. African mines.  No violence.

	Situation serious for adminn.  Wd. become worse if Seretse returns

		to Protectorate.  Want to say in H/C. tht. he can go back to

		see his wife &amp; collect evce for law-suit:  but must add proviso

		re good behaviour.



H.W.	Y’day morning hinted to Party tht. he might go back &amp; live privately

		in tribe.  Don’t make concessions piece-meal.



A.B.	Wd. you forcibly remove him from among his friends in Africa after

		purposes of temporary visit are met.



A.	P. 7 of W. Paper.  Is it geograph. good sense?  Protectorate is v. large.

		If he can’t live there, where in Africa is he to live?  We shd. aim 		at his being able to live in Protectorate tho’ outside Reserve.  We

		are allowg. Tsekedi to stay in Protectorate.



G.W.	Read out draft answer to P.Q. to-day.



A.V.A.	Suppose wife refuses to leave Reserve.



E.Sh.	Shall I be asked to deal with any troubles?



G.W.	If he doesn’t return, no disorder.  If he returned, there might.

		Also if both Seretse &amp; Tsekedi were allowed in.

		Few Police there.  Re-inforcemts. only fr. S. Rhodesia – not

		a v. pleasant request to have to make.



G.A.I.	If we are in for trouble anyway, shdn’t we please our consciences

		&amp; stand the trouble comg. to us?



E.Sh.	Don’t want further trouble in Africa.



G.W.	Liberty to reside in Protectorate.  Can defer decision:  for his 

		temporary stay will be for some months.



R.S.C.      x/	They say now we shall be ready to consider further leave to stay in 

		light of behaviour during tempy visit – troubles wtr. instigated by 

		him or not.



J.	Legal power to exclude?



Att.G.	High Commr. has power to make exclusion order v. anyone living

		there.  But no order yet bn. made.



J.	If he intrigues when there, no diffy. in excluding.  But v. high-handed

		to prevent his going there.

P.M.	Clear that this applies to natives of Protectorate?



Att.G.	Yes.  If satisfied tht. he is danger to the peace of the Protectorate.



R.S.C.        	i)  Limit area to Reserve – as for Tsekedi.

                  	ii)  Add words to effect of x/ above.



A.B.	And revise language of statement. 



H.McN.	And don’t, in Statement, make allowances so brutally subject to 

		behaviour.



G.W.	Want to consult Baring before say x/.



E.Sh.	All is subject to our dealing with disorder.



P.M.	Police?



G.W.	V. few.



R.S.C.	Have troops standing by.



G.W.	More a matter for police than troops.



Att.G.	Publd decision going further than what we now discuss.

		Baring is opposed to either man or wife living in Protectorate.



G.W.	Baring has heard public opinion since then.



R.S.C.	We must wait &amp; see wtr. his presence does cause trouble.

		If it does, we act.



G.W.	I must get apprecn, for M/D., of nature of trouble which may arise.



Att.G.	No excln order v. Mrs Seretse until she has had her child.

		P.M. to settle terms of reply to P.Q.



	Terms of White Paper.



T.W.	Adjectives in references to marriage.



J.	Don’t pitch this case too high.



R.S.C.	I have some amendmts.



G.W.	C.O. has sent some in.



A.	So have I.





J.	Report of Enquiry – air of mystery.

	Why not publish it as App. &amp; say at once which of its arguments 

		you reject.



R.S.C.	If you publish, Rpt’s reasons will be accepted as our reasons.



A.	P. 5. insert “of advice”.  Later:  add “unanimous”.



Att.G.	Para. 10.  Need we say some arguments unacceptable?  Better to

		say merely “incomplete”.



			Agreed:  stet original draft.

			               Omit para. 16.

		P.M. to settle final terms of White Paper.
