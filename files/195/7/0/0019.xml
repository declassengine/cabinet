C.M. 22(49)							24th March 1949



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter W.W.



H.M.	Business for next week.



	Censorship of Plays Bill.



H.M.	Divn of opinion in Legn Cttee.



C.E.	Personal view is against censorship.  Don’t want to argue that case or to defend existing system.  Not defensible in logic and has worked well in practice only in recent years.  Am ready to argue that Bill’s proposals don’t improve matters : on detail, eg. appln to Judge in Chambers and delay pending opening of prosecution.



A.B.	Advocated abolition of censorship.  Wd. secure cleaner plays.  And more plays which aren’t now written because fear of blue pencil.



P.M.	That is a case for abolition not case for this Bill.



A.W.	Not a ques. of indecency only – “political” ques. also come into this.



H.M.	Why walk into this sort of trouble unnecessarily.

                    x/	Content if C.E. will say this is a bad Bill, w’out philosophy.



	Agreed : as at x/.



	Marriage Bill (H/L) – Lord Mancroft.



A.	Coming up in H/L. today.  Will have a large measure of support.

	Shall say we can’t find time for controversial Bill.



J.	Supported this line because promoters of H/C Bill are being urged to avoid controversial points.

							[Exit W.W.



		2.	Film Industry.



H.W.	Had to reduce B. quota – industry has let me down, and knows it.

	Good result – slimming of prodn costs.

	Earlier assumptn tht. B. industry will centre round Rank organisation has bn. falsified.  Must now assume financial assistce for independent cos.

	Can’t aim at removing unemplt. in this industry.  It was over-manned and shd. be slimmed down.



E.B.	State ownership of studio space?  That wd. give Govt. some control over methods and economy – thro’ selection of firms to use the space.



H.W.	Set up Cttee to advise on this ques. under Sir G. Gater.  Their recommn was : no case for it on grds. of studio space.  Film Finance Corpn condns shd. eliminate wasteful production.  Am considering wthr. to requisition 2 studios and rent at reasonable terms.  “To encourage the others”.



A.B.	Advocate requisitioning of studio space for use by independent producers.



E.B.	No good films are being produced for export.



P.M.   	Memo shd be submitted on these questions (B/T).



H.W.  	Finance and distribn are more of bottle-neck than studio space.



H.M.	Why is there a slump at v. moment when this money is being pumped in?

	Rank’s persistent belief that he cd. out-do Hollywood extravagance.

	Italian and French films have done as well in U.S. on basis of cheap films.



E.B.	There is an increasing discriminating public in U.S. – and it is to this that we shd. direct our appeal.

	Nothing in films to correspond with Br. Council p’mme.



A.B.	Support Cttee to consider a partnership betwn. State and industry and at what point.  Need for integrated policy.



P.M.	No more Cttees  Let H.W. pull it together and propose a policy.



H.W.	After further discn with E.B. and R.S.C. on despatch of films abroad : they aren’t earning the f. exchange.



	After Portal Cttee has reported.





		3.	U.N.E.S.C.O. 	Third General Conference.



G.T.	Our Delegn pressed, as Cab. desired, for further economy and concentn on the more practical aspects.  They achieved some success.

	Eg. on money and on frequent mtgs.



P.M.	Large delegation.



G.T.	Smaller than before.  And will be smaller still next time.



H.M.	Why was Foreign Corresp. of Observer included?  



G.T. 	Don’t know.

	Always doubted wisdom of these frills.  Agree they have tried to cut this down.  But what concrete advantage is being secured?

	Do they satisfy themselves tht. they aren’t overlapping into territory of other agencies?



R.S.C.	On expense.  Delegation achieved paymt. in Fr. francs – so it in fact cost us nothing at all and brought dollars into Europe.



G.T.	How can I say wthr. we get value for money in education, generally.

	And we are in this : we can only try to limit it’s activities.



P.M.	“Food and the people” is to be main topic for ’49.  Why not F.A.O.?



G.T.	Amazon exploit?  But scientists are right people to do this.

	If they won’t who will?   



H.W.  	I.T.O.



A.	Our delegation did well in cutting down the frills and extravagance.

	Right policy is to m’tain tht pressure.



N.B.	Don’t forget that we invented this.  And appointed the first Director (Huxley) who had v. expansive ideas.



	Food and the People.  People need education about soil erosion.



C.E.	Our original idea on the war-time Cttee was merely to get educn going post-war in occupied Europe.  UNESCO has gone v. far and wide as cpd. with that.



A.B.	Specialised agencies shd. be harnessed as agents of a central plan. They shd. not be left to take initiative – eg. in Amazon ques.



G.T.	It is for ECOSOC, not for U.K. to co-ordinate and direct it.



E.B.	Can’t press centralisation of Secretariat (U.N.) too far because of attitude of Soviet Union.  Must therefore have specialised agencies a little free for the time being.



H.D.	Delete references to U.K. Delegn para. 6. and App. II.



G.T.	Nothing to hide. Not ashamed.



H.W.	Uniform procedure.  Do other confces  have reports by Delegations to Ministers.



P.M.	Publish, according to earlier precedent, but as S.O. publn not Cmd. Paper.



A.B.	Cut down annual mtgs.

	Go for co-ordination of specialised agencies.



G.T.	Simon criticised last year’s publn as S.O. publn.



	Agreed : as Cmd. Paper.
