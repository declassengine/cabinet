C.M. 37(49).				23rd May, 1949.



	1.	National Health Service.



A.B.	Genl. obsers.

	Diffy. of fitting civil &amp; admve opn into annual budgeting, when shd.

		take 3/4 yrs. to show its shape.  Diff. to take it up by roots

		annually.

	350.000 people &amp; various professions, not all friendly.  Vol. hospitals

		worked on fraudulent balance sheets to attract subscriptions – no

		knowledge of hosp. finance.  L.a.’s kept no separate hosp. 

		a/c’s:  mixed up with general adminve expenses.

	Whole health world in process of reviewg. salaries.

	Financg. of vol. hospitals was brkg. down.  Unknown addl. figure wd.

		have had to be found in any event.

	Had to submit first Estimates v. all these unknown factors.

		E.g. salaries of specialists not fixed even yet.

	Ty. cut those estimates – that led to first Supplementary.

	Figures for 2nd yr’s Estimates had to be submd by Hospital Bds., 

		w’in 6 wks. of taking office.  V. diff. for them, with new staff &amp;

		no previous experience to guide them.  T. asked for cut of £28 m.

		We sought economies.  M’while I had begun series of opns to 

		reduce fees of eye-men, chemists &amp; dentists.  Not much room for

		sums not v. large in reln to totals.  [21.5, 25.5, …]  £88 m in all

		for these 3.

	Dentists – soured public opinion by behaviour.  Cdn’t have got their

		co-opn at lower fees.  Allowed them to misbehave to get atmosph.

		for cut – now cutting 40% net, from 1/6.  Don’t get full benefit

		this year.  Opticians:  20% cut accepted.  Chemists:  small cut

		for bottles.  In full year this will give £13 m. saving on the

		£88 m.  Assumg. use of services stays as at now.  Tho’ I wd.

		believe demand will fall, as old needs are satisfied.

	Adminn – remarkable figures.  Adding all admve expenses together:

		HQ at M/H., Dental &amp; Hosp. Bds. etc., = 2.1% in E. &amp; Wales,

		or around £5. and 3.5% in Scotland.  Not scope for big money

		savings here.  10/11.000 volunteers is explann of low costs.

	Dental, optical &amp; pharmaceutical:  not much room for economies.  

		Backlog is only hope.  Statute forbids me to make a charge,

		even if I thought it advisable.  Alternative therefore = reduce

		service.

	Hospitals.  54% of total cost is for wages &amp; salaries.  Nurses increase

		£7 m. p.a. since Estimate – widely welcomed.  50.000 beds 

		closed.  Another £8 m. to bring x of these into use.  Of £28 m.

		Ty. cut, 25 m. was to fall on hospitals.  Have re-examined Bds.

		estimates.  Salutary for them to learn need to justify estimates.

		Revision indicates that they under-estimated.  Expendre will be

		greater because underestimation of needs.  Far fr. makg. £25 m.

		cut, we shall have to find more money still or reduce services.





	Examples:  Bristol.  £118.000 cut demanded.  Wd mean closing some

		Dpts.

		E. Anglia.  £3.822.000:  cut 167.000.  Wd close 8/900 beds.

		Revised £3.924.000.

		This takes a/c. of some economies – but net increase overall.

	Can “improved” Health Service begin by closing beds &amp; reducing 

		services?

	Must find more money or make a charge.

	Objns to a charge.  a) Surrender.  Political debacle.

		b)  Adminve cost wd. be enormous.  Hosp. beds wd. give 

		biggest yield.  Wd involve means test:  almoners etc.  Wdn’t

		reduce social cost:  wd. only relieve Budget at expense of

		sufferers.

	Ty. diffy:  w’in 2 yrs., two v. large Supplementaries.  But can be met

		by argument of new &amp; unknown service.

	Must face a big increase of cost over what we thght.  But common 

		fate of all Social Services.  True of educn &amp; housing.  Demand

		is much greater than we thought.

	Must avoid destroying good will which N.H. Service has created  for

		Labour Party.

	Figures don’t show incalculable benefits to population.

	Only 2 courses:  cut the Service or find the money.



A.W.	In Scotl. signs of recession in demand on teeth &amp; eyes.

	Economies in prescriptns etc.  But big money is in salaries &amp; hospitals.

		Spens Rpts have bumped up specialists fees.  Can be met in part

		by reducg. real specialisation:  tendency has gone too wide.

	Politically calamitous to infringe principle of free service.  Wd be 

		better even to increase N.I. contn.

	Before war £25 m. spent in Scotland for what will now cost £34 m.

		But preventable disease cost £300 m. pre-war (G.B.) &amp; some

		of this must be off-set.

	In the main, Sc. story is same as English.

	Service is appreciated &amp; in the main is not abused.

	Special Sc. diffy (because rising incidence of t.b.) is cutting back 

		hosp. services.



P.M.	Any evce of unnecessary prescription or unnecessarily expensive ones?



A.W.	Yes:  some – especially the latter.  Dangers also where drs. are

		prescribing what are in effect foods.

	Shall in the end bring doctors to book on this.

	But not big money.



A.B.	£11 m. p.a. on drugs in E. &amp; W.  And £13 m. to chemists for services.

	Arranging for drs. to hold small stocks of e.g. bandages &amp; aspirin.

	Also prohibiting prescription of “foods”.

	Identifying cheaper drugs to exclude fashionable costly drugs.



R.S.C.	What Supplementary this year?

A.B.	As only £6 m. out of £13 m. (this year) fr. dentists etc.;  &amp; as no

		large saving on hospitals &amp; £7 m. more for nurses;  in region of

		£52 m. for E. &amp; W.



A.W.	About £5 m. for Scotland.



R.S.C.	Diffy:  we had no basis for decision in favour of free service.

		We took risk:  we are all responsible for it.

	Balance in Budget £14 m.  Demand for £57 m. for this Suppl. knocks

		one right out.  If I had known I shd. have had to propose

		increased taxation.  I am therefore in gt. diffy. esp. because 

		statement (appd by Cab.) tht. there wd. be no Supplies.

	Agree we can’t cut hospital services down at this stage in Party’s

		fortunes.

	Ques:	a)  Is this £57 m. inevitable?

			b)  Are checks on expendre adequate?

	Machinery for controllg. expendre is novel.  Bd. have no finances:  no

		“own pocket” to encourage thrift as in grant-aided l.a. services.

		Bd. are volunteers – not same fear of the sack.  Can’t surcharge 

		them.  Thus, no means of insistg. upon economy.  Expre 

		controlled by people with no responsibility of finding any part of

		the money.  System must be watched.  Dependant [at this 

		stage:  A.B.] on goodwill of Bds. for ensuring due economy.

		Must be sure it’s a good enough system of controllg. expre of 

		order of £350 m. and more.

	Thus	a)	How can I square this with my Budget?

		b)	Is new expre essential?

		c)	Is system of control adequate?

	Cab. must consider.  M’while recommend putting pressure 

		continuously to get w’in Estimate figure.  Say nothg. yet of

		Supplementaries.  Make it as diff. as possible to get more

		money – as means of forcing economies.  But give M/H. 

		assurance that we don’t intend to solve this by drastic cuts in

		hospital services.



A.	No substantial alternative, in the end, but to pay.  Can’t close beds.

	But two comments:-

		(i)	Spens Rpt.  V. expensive scheme.  Junior clinicians –

			extravagant.  Cd junior grades rates be reviewed?  Must

			cost a lot in aggregate.

		(ii)	Delay in getting on with clinics.  That is approach to 

			real economy.



A.B.	Agreed.  Tho’ too expensive to start it now.



H.M.	Not surprised at all this.

	Always thought 2 difficulties:-

		a)	Hospitals, taken over &amp; put under Bds., wd. spend &amp; spend

			&amp; Ty. &amp; Miny cdn’t control them.  Respons. for financial 

			control must be with M/Health because the Bds. have no

			financial responsibility whatever.  Know from L.C.C.

			experience how much hospitals can spend and what

			pressure they can bring by agitation.

			Problem of public adminn.

		b)	Decided to have one apptd day.  Tremendous task.

			Adminvely much better to have brought it in by stages. 

			2-3 years wd. not have bn. too much.

	Allegations are widespread, but no names are given.

	G.p.’s are prescribing recklessly.

	Congestion of services, causing discontent. e.g. Moorfields.  Delay

		of 2 months in getting specs. (precision worker)

	Spens Report.  Was it brought to Ministers for approval?



A.W.	Decided to accept recommns in advance &amp; so announced.



H.M.	Was that line approved by Cabinet?

	Ramp over abdominal belts for women.  G.P. certificates, for 

		cosmetic reasons.  Too many surgical boots etc.

	Invitation (much feeling aroused) to foreigners.  Leaflet advertising

		the service.  This surely shd. have come to Ministers.  Offering

		facilities to visitors is a ques. of principle.

	Is also in danger of turning an asset to our political disadvantage.

	Can always prove things are necessary?  When do we consider what

		we can afford?

	Ty. will get it again over services remaing. in l.a. control.

		Hope Health Centres won’t be extravagantly done.  Frightened

		by Stoke Newington plans - £350.000 or so.  For l.a. expre will

		or may automatically involve Ty. charge.

	Can we check up on abuses?  E.g. by Social Survey.

	Shd. have periodical reviews &amp; reports.		[Exit  A.W.



A.B.        	i)	Foreigners.  a)  Leaflet prepd last year to provide informn for

		e.g. sailors.  Finds its way into visitors’ hands.  Always

		assumed foreigners wd. have advantage of Service.  We seek

		reciprocity – M/N.I. are concldg. agreemts. for it.

	Assumg. they stayed 1 month &amp; made comparable use of service,

		it wd. cost 1%.

	Cdn’t exclude foreigners w’out perpetuating identity card.

               	ii)	Prescribing.  Can be tackled by disciplinary methods.  Recently

		approved fine of £250 for dentist.  Bound to be some bad

		cases – are they representative?

              	iii)	Opticians.  Some misbehave.  Only long-term cure is to get all on

		salaried basis.  Abuse is due to fact tht. Service is operated by

		private enterprise operators.

               	iv)	Belts.  Only thro’ hospitals on recommn of specialist.  If latter

		recommends wrongly, it’s a matter for professional judgment.

               	v)	One apptd day:  necessary to bring hostile professions into line.

		Need for a dramatic change.





H.D.	Supported R.S.C. view.

	Hope A.B. won’t abandon pressure to secure economy whenever and		wherever it can be secured.

	Nervous of adminve overheads.  Even small percentage = large sums		of money.

	Much talk among Govt. supporters.

	Tho’ a new method of financial control, had hoped we shd. get 

		comparative costings methods.



A.B.	Can’t get them yet.



C.J.	Bulk purchase of appliances?



A.B.	Doing it already.  See Appendix.



G.T.	a)	Repercussions – esp. on l.a.’s.  Disturbed by effect of Spens Rpt.			in Universities &amp; l.a. services.  Must get these earnings

			in right relation – reducg. dentists’ earnings etc.

	b)	Financial control.  Method must be different.  But we must

			find one – urgently.



	National Insurance.



P.M.	V. modest a/c of 1st rate adminve job.  Congrats to J.G.



J.G.	Survived 1st winter.  Now seekg. simplifn of procedures.  May mean

		redn in staff.

	Complete figures of industl accident – for 1st time.  Throws up some

		problems wh. I want to bring to L.P. Cttee.

	Disurbg. feature:  over ⅓rd of claims are for disease &amp; much for

		pneumoconiosis.  V. dangerous.  Also occupational dermatitis.

		Means more attn to preventive medicine.

	Too early yet for conclns.  But believe there is case for campaign.



H.M.	“Political” activities by doctors etc.

	Hear it also about local offices of M/F. etc., M/F &amp; P.

	May I discuss this with a few Ministers?



P.M.	Agreed.

				[Exit  J.G.

				[Enter  W.P. &amp; Att.G.

	2.	Telegraph Bill.



W.P.	As in new memo.



R.S.C.	……….

	Not practicable to put whole increase on to call charges.

	Rentals:  small but essential part of Budget plans.

	Can’t drop this plan – ready to make it as painless as possible.



		Now won’t make any financial diffce which method is adopted,

		since can’t get any paymt. until Jan. quarter.



H.M.	P.M.G. has no commercial case for the increased rental.  He is making

		profit.  It is a revenue charge.

	Date in relation to Election.  V. awkward moment.  Askg. for 

		trouble.



A.	Don’t do this by legn.  Bad enough to do it anyway.



A.B.	Can’t you let rental element go?



N.B.	Support that.  Don’t even like idea of preventg. or discouraging

		use of telephone.  Mainly business use, however.  And we are

		increasg. costs, where we commend reducg. them.



			Agreed:  No Bill.

			               Tell H/C. they can debate rentals this p.m.
