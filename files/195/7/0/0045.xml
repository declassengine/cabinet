C.M. 49(49).				27th July, 1949.

	

	1.	Animal Feedingstuffs.

			                                  [Enter  E.Sh., Dugdale, A.H., Gl. Hall, 

			                                   J.S. &amp; E.E.B.



P.M.	M/Ag. wants to announce increase in rations.

	Will this involve dollars?



J.S.	Arg. agreemt. is thro’.  So is cereals part of R. Agreement.

	Justifiable now to do this.



T.W.	No dollars involved.



J.S.	Involves only small calculated risk on R. Agreement.



P.M.	Make it clear in statement  a) one year only.

			                          b) no dollars involved, now or in future.



H.W.	Think it may be approved.  Was doubtful about 20% for wheat.  If we

		had more time we shd. have liked to consider – farmers’ freedom

		to keep 20%.

		For M/F. may be in trouble later over wheat.



J.S.	They didn’t in fact keep anything like 20% last year:  &amp; prob. won’t

		again.

	Hope we will urge farmers to expand wheat at expense of coarse

		grains.  For non-dollar c.g. will be more plentiful than dollar

		wheat in future years.

	Hope exp. p’mme will be re-examined.



T.W.	Am doing so.  And will press wheat target in speech.

	On the 20% - wheat goes to poultry.



E.E.B.	Shd have liked time to consider.

	Can’t discuss non-dollar c.g. w’out reln to dollar wheat.

	If it must be settled to-day, shd. like to be assured tht. no switchg. to

		dollar supplies for c. gr. if supplies can’t be got fr. non-dollar

		sources.



P.M.	Check dollar part of statement with Ty.



H.W.	Don’t refer to sources.



			Announcement approved.

				[Exit  J.S. and E.E.B.



	2.	Married Quarters for Services.



A.B.	Raise no ques.

P.M.	Service Ministers.  Reply:  no obsus.



Gl.H.	No obsus.

			Agreed.

				[Exit  3 Serv. Ministers.

				[Enter  G.S., W.P., J.G.



	3.	R.O.F.’s Involuntary Absenteeism.



P.M.	Two points  a) visitation  b) certification.



G.S.	We employ only 10% of industrials – but have better figures.

		Situation far worse in old development areas.  S. Wales specially

		bad.

		More on time rates than on piece rates.

	Agreemt. lasts 2 years.



W.P.	Only 6/900 industrials.

	General.  67% in 42/43.  But ’48 were comparable to M/S. figures ’47.



J.G.	Certification.  Specific complaint stated.  If we have doubt we refer to

	Regional M.O. of  M/H.  Refer again after period of absence.

	But imposs. to apply to short-term sickness, save on a sample.

	Our impn:  no increase among those dependent on normal benefit.  But

		higher figures where pay contd thro’ illness.



G.S.	Central Prodn Council has discussed this ques. – with some heat.

		Scheme devised for morale talks in factories by Parly. Secy. &amp;

		T.U. repve.

	Woolwich:  best:  2.7% in May.

	Glascord:  worst:  16.5% (and call it Marshall Aid).

		Bad effect on surrounding private enterprise factories – why shd.

		we work hard when chaps in R.O.F.’s are doing this.



Gl.H.	Discussed by J. Co-ordn Cttee - &amp; coming up on 28/7.



A.B.	Isolated factories – no community associated with place of work.

		V. diff. to create a morale.

	N.H. scheme doesn’t explain this.  Because certifn = average.  And this

		varies.

	Suggest M/S., M/H. and M/N.I. shd. consider a temporary blitz on

		certification in connn with R.O.F.’s.



G.T.	A scheme wh. means paying people more when sick than working 

		is bound to break down.  That’s the thing to tackle.

	Friendlies found sick visiting quite inevitable.

	Doctors have always bn. ready to sign certificates.



H.M.	That is common sense.

	Why wasn’t this scheme submitted to Cab. or Cttee?

	We are now landed in indefensible position.

		Some are better off when sick.

	Med. Research Council have studied.  Hope they will be consulted.

	Suggest a w. party to devise means of preventg. this living on p. funds.



G.A.I.	In newspp. industry.  Clerks got full pay:  others not.  Sickness among

		clerks twice as high.



P.M.	Parly Secy. visits to factories.

		Talk to T. Unions.

		Working party (general.  Shd. cover incidence of P.A.Y.E.)			            P.M. to settle.

			                                            [Exit  W.P. and J.G., Gl. Hall.			                                            [Enter  W.W. and Att.G.

	4.	Iron and Steel Bill.



G.S.	As in memo.



W.W.	Wanted to be able to say H/L. killed it.



G.S.	When is Bill actually dead?



H.M.	Surely Speaker cd. certify amendment altering the date.

	But (later) if there’s any element of doubt, wiser to leave it over

		until the autumn.



H.D.	Shan’t we weaken our posn publicly?



H.M.	No:  we haven’t said we will finish it this week.

				[Exit  G.S.  Enter  G.W.





	5.	Deportation of British Subjects from U.K.



C.E.	The U.K. is still the mother country.  Grave step to take because of

		 particular troubles over dock-strike.



P.M.	Can’t upset Colonies citizenship.  Thus, wd. discriminate against our

		Doms.



A.B.	a)  M/L. must be protected v. Dom. agitators.

	b)  Are we still a country of emigration.  There is much immigration

			into U.K. from Colonies.  Communists cd. exploit this to

			our discomfiture.

	c)  Why shd. we be more liberal than Austr., N.Z. and Canada.

		Not so simple as H.O. memo. suggests.  Cd. we look at it at 			leisure.



Att.G.	No legal diffy. in doing this.

	But on policy oppose it.  U.K. is mother country, or at least hub, of

		Commonw.  And right to enter &amp; reside in U.K. is at heart of

		that.

	Don’t alter this fundamental principle because stampeding by a couple

		of Canadians.



H.M.	No reason why limited power to deport a man who is a nuisance shd.

		strike at roots of Commonwealth.



C.J.	This tradn is highly prized in Colonies.

	Increasg. drift of Colonials to U.K. because high social advantages.

		This is a big problem.

	Problem might be examined.  Tho’ agree with Att.G. it is fundamental.



P.M.	Your plan or suggn is v. far-reaching – more so than individual 

		deportn.



A.	Believe individual deportn is not inconsistent with H.O. genl. view.



J.	Wd be complete departure fr. our tradns.

	May be necessary to do it.  Doubt if we need do it yet.

	Don’t therefore in reply to P.Q. preclude action future.



C.E.	H/C. dropped this like a hot brick the other day.

	Don’t overstate the line I have taken.

	Further point:  Parlt. wdn’t give me a right to deport a B.s with no

		reasons stated.  [Don’t want to be put into that position qua

		aliens.]

			Agreed:  Defer consideration 

			               Frame reply to P.Q. “… opens v. wide issues on

			                        wh. I am not prepd to pronounce at the

			                        present time.”  Terms to be agreed with 

			                        P.M. &amp; H.M.





	6.	International Commission on Whaling



		Memo. approved.
