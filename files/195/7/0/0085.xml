C.M. 22 (50)					20th April, 1950



1.	    Parliament.

					         [Enter W.W.

H.M.	Business for next week.

	On 24/4 Prayer – (Boyd-Carpenter) v. Order on T.C.P. ques.

	On 25/4 2 Prayers – on B/T matters.  One is set out of order &amp; other mayn’t be pressed.

	On 26/4 at 7.pm. Luton Corpn Bill and another.  To be defeated.  But w’out formal Whip.



T.W.	On 27/4 discn on Fish.  With wide variety of foods available, we have more U.K. cod than market can absorb.  We have no policy.  Tories in Election favoured White Fish Commn.  H.McN. will be in trouble over Aberdeen.  We shall be in trouble in debate.  Foreign imports of fish are increasing.





2.	    T.C.P. Valuations.



H.D.	L.a.’s excited re condn of grant for acquisition of land under Act of ’47.

		Regs. require them to employ D. Valuer if they are to qualify for grant.

		Prayer v. Regs. Depn from l.a.’s strongly urged on me tht. many l.a.’s have good valuers:  willing to accept requiremt. tht. price be approved. by D. Valuer, so long as own valuers can do prelim. negotn if desired.

		Force in this case.  Many Labour M.P.’s disturbed over this.

	Have discussed with Hayward of L.C.C.  Want to see him again today re poss. compromise.  Best line:  promise amendg. Regn leavg. it to me, to decide wtr. any authy or class of authy shd. be required to use D. Valuer – &amp; say at once tht. certain large authies wd. not be compelled to use him.

	W’out some concession we shall be beaten.



R.S.C.	Reasons:	often mainly Govt. money – up to 90%.

			uniform valuation system betwn. Dpts. because developmt.

			charge.

			rating valuation has bn. centralised.  Less work for l.a. valuers to do.

	Not only tidy organn:  but need to safeguard Govt. money &amp; to have central uniform valuation procedure.

	Shdn’t have compromised apart fr. political pressure.



H.D.	Politics are diff. &amp; urgent.  Hayward is v. co-operative.  But he must have time to call off opposition.



A.	In H/L. you cdn’t carry Regs. as they now stand.  Favour concession.



A.B.	May I be brght. in on discns re formula?

	Doubt value of uniform D.V. valuation.  Their prices are often v. high.

	But formula discriminatg. betwn. one class of authy and another will be v. embarrassing to me.



H.M.	My sympathy is wholly with l.a.’s on merits.  Whitehall is being too bossy.  In this Parlt., they can’t.

	So long as final approval rests with D.V., shd. be O.K.



P.M.			{Agree in principle tht. some concession must be made.

			{ T.C.P. to settle formula with Ty., M/H. &amp; Scotland.



G.T.	Use of D.V. doesn’t always secure economy.



H.D.	Leave to my discretion to decide wtr. any authy [or class of authy] shd. have to use D. Valuer.  No reference to size of authy.

	May I tell Hayward at once I am willing to say that?



A.B.	Omit [ ].



H.M.	Agreed.  And proceed to-day.



			Agreed:  Some concession must be made.

			               4 Dpts. to meet this a.m. to arrange formula.

			               4 Ministers to settle formula at 2.pm.





3.	    Dock Strike.

			                                [Enter B., G.S., H.G., N.B., Pakenham.



	Position discussed (I was out of room for 15 mins.).

		Note taken tht. Emergencies Cttee were mtg. that afternoon.





4.	    Socialised Industries.



H.M.	SIM. Cttee have bn. discussg. these ques. for 2 yrs.  They don’t all agree with everything said in my memo.  Don’t want to imply tht. Bds. haven’t done a big job – as have the Ministers, too, with heavy legn.

			 a)  Efficiency.  If Parlt. considers Bd. aren’t efficient or 			      aren’t organised efficiently, we aren’t in posn to satisfy 			      them.  My solution:  common efficiency unit.  These are 			      vast undertakgs.  Can Bds. really control efficiency, esp. 			      if they don’t trust their officers.  Common unit better 			      than one for each.

	In Parlt. some support for Select Cttee supervision. SIM Cttee fear that, if Bd. members are liable to be so grilled, they wd. be unwilling to take risks.

	Chairman of Bds. persist in suspectg. tht. eff. unit wd. be Govt Gestapo.

		After months of delay, they have produced no alternative.

	b)  Bd. Membership.  Not getting best men.  Big names 		     aren’t always best men.

         c)  Relations with Ministers.  Time now to stiffen up 		     relationship – so that Bds. will take due account of Govt. 	     policy.

         d)  Periodical Enquiries – on B.B.C. lines.

         e)  Public Accountability.  Suggns in para. 16.

         f)  Consumers’ Council.  Tho’ they exist, public don’t 	      	     realise it.  Suggest enquiry &amp; overhaul.  Bds. must be  	     subject to consumer pressure.

         g)  Public Relations.  Believe Bds. have not done this well.  	     Annex.

		Bds. haven’t bn. consulted on this.

		Commend summary of recommns in para. 21.



	a) Efficiency Unit…..



E.Sh.	What is the inefficiency  wh. occasions this suggn?



N.B.	Para. 4-5:  9-12.  Cause me diffy.  Nothg. to justify L.P. complts. re inefficiency.  His proposal is premature – anyway not suffly precise to form basis of approach to Bds.  I have ???? to deal with.  Their problems are different – but all have had to absorb no. of units not of their choosing &amp; of varying efficiency.  They are already beginning to get results.  Electricity, in particular, have done a v. gt. deal.

	N.C.B. have done much in way of re-organn.  Have used industrial adviser firm.  Have always bn. ready to listen to suggn.

	Main function of Ministers is to prompt and lead Bds.  But if we approached them in his language, we shd. have trouble.  Bds. were chosen by us as best men:  how justify setting over them a body of “experts”.

	SIM Cttee asked me to propose memo. on Consultve Councils.  Before Cab. takes decisions.

a)	Parent Ministers shd. submit memo. on results.

b)	L.P. shd. say more explicitly what he wants.



B.	We all want efficiency.  But L.P.’s approach is too quick &amp; too general.  Vast initial task of Bds.  Vice general approach, prefer to choose particular moment &amp; particular problem for investign – on specific weakness in any phase of activities.  No resentment by Bds. twds that.  But a roaming enquiry wdn’t be acceptable.



P.	Support view of L.P.  We shall be held responsible for efficiency.  How do we discharge that?  Can’t do it ourselves, w’out duplicatg. staff. Must therefore do it be eff. unit.  I support that.



H.G.	Much disillusionment over natn.  But due, not to inefficiency, but to exaggerated hope &amp; to fact we took over at times of rising costs.

		Much of criticism directed at Fuel &amp; Power Bds. shd. be directed at our decisions re wages.

	Diff. to measure efficiency – more so than L.P. thinks.  Problem differs fr. one Bd. to another.  Don’t think any advantage in common unit.  Duty of Ministers to see Bds. are efficient:  but believe we’ll do it better w’out common unit.



A.B.	Tendency to make wrong approach.  Intellectual prepn inside Socialist movement = e.g. by Sidney Webb.  We shd. begin fr. Webb’s assumptn tht. any organn beyond a certain size, public or private, must have some defects.  Need therefore for 2 types of eff. unit.

a)	internal in each Bd., incldg. comparative costing procedures. But these ossify. Therefore

b)	common eff. unit wh. isn’t creature of any particular Bd.  A good industl consultant can produce principles wh. we. apply widely to difft. organns.

	Unless you can prove to Parlt. external vigilance as well as a), you won’t avoid Sel. Cttee. [I cdn’t get away with it in Parlt., in N.H.S., if I said merely tht. M/H. had w’in it an efficient costing organn.]

		And Sel. Cttee wd. be disastrous.  Argument on pol. basis.  Also risk of industrial interests bribing members.

	Need for automatic mechanism in Govt. machine for this.



P.M.	Parlt. will say

a)	proves you distrust your Bds. &amp; your Ministers.

b)	only a Govt. watch-dog:  not independent.

	Either large unit with many specialists, or small one calling in specialists. I wd. prefer Bds. to call in specialists ad hoc.



J.G.	Mining.  For prodn one set of specialists.  Indl consultant wdn’t help.

	Main criticism is of adminn. 

a)	centralisation.

b)	over-staffed

c)	over-paid at all levels.  

	Cd. adminn be subjected to efficy test.



E.Sh.	Commend L.P.’s objective.  Right to keep watchful eye on efficiency of socialised industies.

	But we apprd experts to run them.  SIM Cttee stipulated that Area Bds. shd. be left to N.C.B. – because no bureaucratic interferences.  Lookg. back, I now think we shd. have apptd Chairmen &amp; some members of Area Bds.

	Are we now being asked to appoint another set of experts to watch these experts?  Where wd. that end?

	My view:  Minister shd. keep his eye on efficiency, keep in touch with Board, give general advice etc.  If the Ministers aren’t satisfied, they can &amp; shd. do more.  Minister is responsible.  Remedy:  if he doesn’t do his job, get someone else.  Same for Chairman of Bd.  That is best hope of efficiency.

	I repudiate charges of inefficiency.  Electricity doing v. well.  So is coal.  Don’t respect complaints like those quoted by J.G. – most of which come fr. men who failed to get job.



G.S.	Mainly a problem of public accountability.  Public won’t be satisfied with statements by Minister of Bd. tht. all is well.  Nor can Minister know.

		Believe – tho’ it may be a bit early – we must have outside body wh. can report on adminn side of socialised industries.  Parlt. bound to ask for this soon.  Not essential to have a common unit for all:  might be two or three.



H.W.	V. dangerous to think tht. outside expert can make no contn to problems of an industry – even its techn. problems.  cf. results by outsiders in cotton industry:  and how little the experts in the industry knew about coal.

	Support L.P. memo.  Public need re-assurance on 

		i) Inevitable ineffic. in large organn.

		ii) Indies weren’t eff. when we took them over - &amp; included

		     many duds we have taken over.  cf. rlway directing staff.

	Two problems:  Production.  Organisation.  An O &amp; M set-up might help on the second.  On the first, B.I. Managemt. has list of reputable industrial consultants.  Cd. we use B.I.M. to provide &amp; bring in consultants.



T.W.	Support E.Sh.  Dissent fr. first sentence of 21 (i).  Parent Ministers are responsible.  B. suggested ad hoc attack on particular weaknesses.  Regular mtgs. betwn. Ministers &amp; Bd.  Leave it to that.  Prefer to trust my Ministerial colleagues rather than outside experts in common effic. unit.



H.McN.	Attracted by H.M.’s plan – as experiment.

	Why are Dpt. Ministers on defensive?  It’s because indies weren’t efficient that we took them over.  Must be room for improvement.

		Our task is to consider means of securing it.

	Comm. eff. unit – as experiment.  ?Leave it with Ch/Exch., for use on request or at his discretion.  Need for semi-independent evidence.



C.E.	Genl. support for L.P.  T.W. over-estimates capacity of Ministers.

		They need skilled advisers to help them.  Two kinds of problem – 

i.   Technical.  Will differ acc. to industry.  This presumably 

      is not what L.P. is after.

ii.  general adminve v organisational efficiency.

		This is common to all.

	Support idea of small unit (under L.P.) wh., at request or on invitation of S.I.M., shd. recommend what outside consultant shd. be called in.

		More scope for variety &amp; freshness.



J.	Two tasks	 a) secure efficiency

 b) satisfy public you have done so.

	For b) you must have some independent body.



R.S.C.	That is why we bring in outside Chairman in O &amp; M enquiries.

		(Actually M.G. enquiries).



A.V.A.	Want more informn before I can make up my mind.

	Cdn’t assent now to 21 (i):  for I don’t know what their methods are. 

		Tho’ wd. acquiesce in it w’out its first sentence.



P.M.	Mustn’t use that language because you can’t support it.



A.V.A.	Want efficiency:  but not at cost of constant outside interference of socialised indies.

	Cd. we ask for Chairman’s views &amp; then continue discn on basis of more informn.



A.	Warning.  Ties up with future of Labour Party.  Must satisfy people this is better system, in practice, than earlier.  Tho’ must give them reasonable time:  our duty to stimulate increased efficiency.

	Standing panel fr. wh. to draw consultants.  Not same unit for all enquiries.  

		Wdn’t impose anything on Boards.  Wd. ask Chairmen for their views.  Can express anxiety.



G.T.	I’m as suspicious of experts as of rest.

	Believe trouble is tht. those who are workg. these indies don’t believe in nationalisation.

	Suggest askg. Parly Party to examine complaints re workg, if indies.

		Don’t believe indies are inefficient.   What is wrong is motives of those i/c.



H.D.	Don’t approach Chairman at this stage.  For we aren’t yet agreed.	We all want some mechanism for ensuring efficiency.  But we don’t all favour common efficiency unit or industrial consultants.

		Use of B.I. Managemt. might make approach more palatable.

	But even so, not satisfy. there are so many people who wd. walk in &amp; tell Bds. how to do things better.

	Start fr. basis tht. indies are better run than they were before.



G.W.	If we don’t find better alternative, we shall land in Select Cttee.

	Who can object reasonably to somethg. like O &amp; M?

i)	shd. be on request of Minister or Bd.

ii)	shd. have some common core, tho’ it wd. have to use outside experts also.



P.M.	i) Need for case re timing.  Premature.

	ii) More examn of type of “audit”.  Rather favour G.W.’s ideas.  Both C. Servant &amp; business-men have much to learn fr. one another.

	iii) Periodical Enquiry.  Doubtful.  B.B.C. false analogy because tht. influences publ. opinion.  Implies somethg. is wrong.

			Suggest discussion of memo. might be resumed.



H.M.	Unwise to let things drift.  Must provide channels of criticism &amp; investign.  V. dangerous also tht. Bds. shd. grow to think themselves “untouchable”.  No Minister or Bd., on their own judgmt., can tell wtr. industry is efficient.



A.B.	Let responsble Ministers submit particulars of what internal organns each Bd. has now.

	ii) Public Accountability.  That is for Govt. not for Boards.

		All Socialists always knew tht. there wd. be need for common unit w’in Govt. machine.



			Discussion to be resumed.



5.	    Displaced Persons.



P.M.	H.O., F.O., C.R.O., Health Dpts.. &amp; Ty to meet – with C.E. in Chair.





[C.M. 23(50). 21st April , ’50. I was absent because of mtg. of Honours Committee.]
