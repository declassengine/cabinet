  <content>C.C. 18(60). 17th March, 1960.
1. British Transport Commission. [Enter M.R., R.W.
P.M. Alternatives as in memo.
Practical choice is prob. betwn a) and c).
H.A. Advantage of a) : get our posn. clear while public is aware of problem. We shd. command public support.
Agree b) is out. What wd. in fact happen under c)?
E.H. B.R. wd. propose working party on rept. as a whole : unions wd. prob. accept : they can’t forecast time, tho’ obviously wd. take time : dating wd. be last thing to discuss.
E.M. B.R. has met Unions who said they wanted date fixed first – at a back date.
E.H. My infn. is tht. only Aslef have asked for back-dating . X/March 3 will become more attractive than now if fixed at end of negotiations.
E.M. Choice depends on wtr we will face a strike over the date. If we are ready to do that, I wd. chose a).
P.M. Sure we shd. resist it : not sure we shd. provoke it.
K. x/ is powerful argument in favour of c).
M. a) wd. be provocative.
P.M. Then we must keep initiative by going ahead at once with Cttee. on re-organn.
Ch.H. Suppose B.R. wd. ask for Govt.’s views &amp; we give our statement in return. That wd. avoid appearance of diktat, but wd. make our position clear.
R.M. That is attractive. c) may have p. opinion in confusion.
S.Ll. I am attracted by b). Budget speech will have set a pattern v. which v. little public sympathy for strike for retrospn.
I.M. I favour c) for reason given by K.
D.E. I favour a) because it will get p. opinion on our side. Cd. we say : we had bn. thinking of phasing implemn. : but we have given that up &amp; instead we insist on date of Mar. 3.
P.M. No credit in retreating from a posn. we never took up.
If unions are in quiet mood, is there any point in provoking them.
E.M. We cd. allow negotns. to start : see how unions attitude clarifies : we cd. then make a statement later.
P.M. B.R. cd. refer to P.M.’s statement…..
Ch.H. Still think Govt. shd. make plain i) it under-writes report ii) insists on co-opn. in re-organn. iii) date. They shd. be made plain early on.
P.M. Impressed by x/. Also by then Budget statement will have influenced p. opinion.
I.M. Let BR. say : you’ve seen what P.M. has said on report : I’m sure that in light of that we can reach an agreement on rept : let’s get down to the business of negotiation on the detail.
H.A. If so, we must reserve right to come in at any point if negotns. go wrong.
P.M. Let us settle on basis of I.M.’s formula.
Get ahead with the planning board. [Exit R.W.
2. Economic Situation.
H.A. Don’t want to reverse expansion. But there is need of a check to steady rate of expansion. Because of i) forecast of deterioration in b/p. because of disparity of export/import posn. ii) prospect of excessive wage increases iii) labour shortage is spreading iv) expansion of credit – h.p. and Bank advances.
I.M. B/p. picture is not encouraging. I wdn’t question Ch.’s [Enter H.B., RAB.
wish to have some check. Presentation is important. Havg. torn U.K. out of a depression &amp; fought Election on basis of ‘never had it so good’ we must avoid charge of trimming on our philosophy. Relate it therefore to fwd. commitments.
D.E. Agree on b/p. Doubt if overload on economy is as serious as he thinks. Will be patchy &amp; unlikely to push up prices. But as exports aren’t rising in step with increased imports, price stabilitymayn’t be enough. B/p. cd. be handled if we didn’t lend overseas more than our surplus. Thus, small check on consumptn. at home &amp; less lending abroad. Avoid measures wh. people can off-set by saving less. Is a selective check on investment possible – falling on non-productive? If not, check shd. be wholly on consumption.
K. Memo. Except for 2 paras, wd. give grounds for gt. optimism. Even wages – no harm in increase after rise in production.
We need early forecast on risk of b/p. crisis in autumn. If real risk of that, we shd. take preventive action now. We never seem to get news of that in sufficient time.
H.A. V. diff. to be precise or certain.
K. Crowther. Useful also if we considered H.A.’s memo., with its 7 policy points, cd. be considered early – with general reference not merely special reference to Crowther.
H.A. Yes : lesson for the future, wh. Plowden will point.
K. Even so, remember tht. p. opinion has bn. convinced that they have “never had it so good.”
S.Ll. Agree : if we do this, method must be such as to avoid misunderstanding.
Imports : how far is it due to stock-building.
P.M. Presentation : Election argument not only tht. prosperity be m’tained but that tht. prosperity shd. be shared. We cd. relate a check to that.
Hail. Risk that check wd. affect productivity – thro’ impact on productive investment. [Enter Home.
H.B. We must
Endorse point about sharing prosperity. Danger of Stock Exchange boom avoid autumn crisis. Checks must, not, however, appear to be reversal of policy. Trouble is patchy &amp; unemplt. in E &amp; W. varies from 1% to 12%.
Public opinion wd. understand if those who benefit must pay more – e.g. roads.
M. Not so much alarmed by H.A.’s 4 points. Offset by rise in prodn. &amp; savings. Alarmed by increasing public expenditure : commitments &amp; new ventures. Fear checks on industry – we can quickly turn to slump.
B/payments : we can stand a little strain. Rise in imports isn’t surprising : returning confidence after depression. Wd. expect that posn. to improve.
J.M. Worst sitn. wd. be drastic measures in autumn.
But unselective brakes are v. bad – appln. to depressed areas.
H. Support H.B.’s approach. Realise how few selected instruments there are. Prefer to make people pay more for what they get – e.g. roads.
R.A.B. B/p. Import bill is rising too much. We have bn. too liberal in trade policies – e.g. Japan, and even U.S. Farmers don’t like it.
Evce. to Radcliffe makes it plain tht. advice given to me in ’55 was wrong : the Bank rate alone is not effective. H.A. shd. act on Banks wh. ought to be brought nearer to Fed. Reserve system : we shd. be able to deal directly on advances &amp; deposits. Hope Ty. will apply the system worked out.
Stockbldg. is continuing : affect on imports.
Our oversea posn. is precarious : if Ch/Ex. fears a crisis he shd. be encouraged to act in time, while small steps will suffice.
E.H. B/p. is worrying. If crisis, it won’t be because lack of confidence in our domestic posn. : it will be due to factual import/export position. Exporters aren’t sufficiently dynamic. We don’t know enough about stockbldg.
Increased import of manufactured goods – how will this affect us.
Domestic posn. Unemployment 350.000 average for 1960. 324.000 at low point, rising to 365.000 at end/year. In 1961 v. large rise in juvenile unemplt. because end of N. Service.
Wages. Weighted percentages worked out : a phase is nearly over. 68 settlements : 4.2% weighted over 21 months – 7.3 m. workers. In period with gt. increase prodn.
H.A. But 22 m. in work – where are remainder?
E.H. 3 m. in Wages Council area, under 4%. Rest haven’t moved.
E.H. Agree on presentation. People are hoping we can keep our nerve for longer when in prosperity.
Ch.H. Public can’t understand restraint on production. They can understand income/expenditure ques. Hope checks can be related to bills.
H.A. Can’t refrain from doing what is necessary because people don’t understand. With a free economy, people must expect Govt. to apply control from time to time.
E.M. Favour check on consumption : h.p. to check increases in cars!
Building : overload only where bricks used. C. engineering : prices are 10% down &amp; this suggests under-loading. This side of the industry cd. do more.
Motorists cd. be asked to pay more for roads : esp. private motorists. Do it now. Unpopularity early, if at all.
P.M. Political diffy. of presentation – 6 mos. after Election.
Reality &amp; appearances. In past we have added to our diffies. by talking the economy down – economists &amp; bankers are quickly frightened.
The reality is – if we spend more than we earn, we shall exhaust our reserves. Is imparity betwn. exports &amp; imports going to create crisis. £60 M gap on visibles : but 220 on invisibles : so net profit of £160 M. Overall loss of £200 M. on reserves is forecast. But r.s.a. may off-set that – by lending more to us. If increase of imports is due to stocking, why need we worry : we hold raw materials vice
Increased taxation related to forward commitments won’t have v. much effect on consumptn. It is only symbolic. Wdn’t destroy picture of expanding economy : or appear to be reversal of policy. I accept need for that sort of measure. [Increase in N.H. stamp is of that character : not a fiscal measure. But cd. be considered separately because no more than switch of emphasis betwn taxpayer and contributor.] gold. Shortage of steel : but that’s due to havg. lost our nerve earlier over expansion of our steel industry. Don’t try to balance at a low level of activity. On merits we need do v. little.
Bank rate or limitn. of advances need not be employed in Budget. Flexible : can be used at any time, as needed. Better on whole not to use it in Budget.
Increase in personal savings – not
Last year we budgeted for deficit of £710 M. Ty. now fear that figure won’t be reached. Deficit has bn. financed by increased revenue and personal savings. Credit base has not bn. expanded. after increase in h.p. etc., Disastrous if we did anything to reverse that trend. Its revival is tremendously important.
In short : on Budget, with rising commitments, addl. revenue must be provided for : people will understand that.
new Bank deposit plan can be tried on its merits.
hire-purchase can be instrument for applying a check-in tandem with the
Bank plan. Can also be justified on Puritan grounds. Present it
on general principles.
Suggest a separate discussion on N.H. stamp.
3. Education. [Enter B-C.
R.A.B. Education Policy Cttee. : 6 mtgs : attended by Ty. repves. Yet report by officials not until 10/3.
I have, against the grain, advised my colleagues to reject both of the main recommns. of Crowther Rpt.
Against that, we asked only for 8.000 more places for teachers.
We can’t go forward with our policy for youth if we are to do nothing at all on those lines. I adhere to Cttee’s. recommns. Our proposal wd. be increase of 1 or 2 per cent on the committed expansion of 50%.
Can we not find some way of presenting policy of smaller classes w’out prs. committing ourselves to particular plan for teacher training places.
D.E. If we are to reject Crowther’s big proposals, we must be able to say we are going faster with redn. of oversize-classes.
H.A.’s memo. reproduces officials’ arguments, wh. we answered in Cttee.
i) Suggests it deals only with posn. after 1970. Not so, it’s to ensure
teachers’ co-opn. in next 5 years.
ii) demand for teachers will be larger than Ty. assume. Overseas demand
is most important – a cheap &amp; rewarding form of aid. Nos. in schools:
don’t accept Ty. estimate : they have always bn. wrong, and under-
estimates. [5% more children]
iii) Ty. assumptn. re
Insufficient account of earlier marriage. women leaving teaching is also optimistic.
H. We have committed ourselves to Doms. to provide 400 teachers for overseas. Can we keep this pledge if we don’t expand training.
I.M. Support that.
H.A. Para. 4 of RAB.’s memo. Was a genl. pledge given? I thought only re
We must look at commitments before accepting a new one. primary schools.
I believe tht. our record &amp; achievement in educn. is creditable. If we decide to do more on it, where else can we retrench?
RAB.’s figure doesn’t take a/c of the cost of the teachers when trained.
P.M. Wastage?
D.E. About 6.000 p.a. But if we can give refresher courses we cd. get some married women back into the profession.
Hail. Don’t accept para. 6 of H.A.’s memo. If we don’t need them we shall reduce training : if we do, we shd. have to pay for them anyway.
P.M. Ques is : what are we to say? Reject 16 on argument tht. we shall reach 80% voluntary. Reject Co Colleges. Present what we are doing now. What more?
D.E. Want to announce plan for more teachers. Won’t go into Estimates until 1962.
H. Not really a new commitment : we visualised it some time ago. We cdn’t have promised 400 overseas unless there was to be expansion.
H.B. What of the growth to wh. we are already committed. 50% increase in 9 years. Educn. already = 7/= on local rates : and will rise to 10/6 or 12/=. Rateable value doesn’t expand as fast as taxable capacity. We really shd. not take on extra commitments.
P.M. Concentrate in debate on nature and cost of existing p’mme. And add that we are planning to reduce size of classes &amp; hope in 2 years’ time to create more places in teacher training colleges.
H.A. Can we avoid a pledge?
P.M. “Hope to make a start on this in 1962”
H.B. If 8.000 is mentioned, we shall have ear-marked all available surplus &amp; shall have to reject demands on roads etc.,
I don’t see how existing expanding commitments can be handled by l.e.a.’s.
P.M. Blur the edges : make it an “aim”.
4. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.</content>
