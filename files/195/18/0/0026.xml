  <content>C.C. 34(59). 11th June, 1959.
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H., Profumo.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
2. Germany.
P.M. Crisis of F.M. Mtg. has now bn. reached. Skill of S.Ll. in handling this over these 4 wks. has bn. outstanding. In spite of Adenauer’s efforts, and de Gaulle’s posn., he has succeeded in getting reasonably flexible attitude on W. side. I have never concealed my view tht. W. posn. is untenable, &amp; may lead to dipl. defeat. This made me suspect, but at last others are beginning to see it. G. insistence on enjoying indefinitely the consequences of their defeat. W. insistence on juridical posn. wh., in practical terms, is ridiculous.
Latest R. offer. a) offers a year’s pause, b) contains unacceptable condns.
Best way out : preamble rehearsing views of each side on juridical posn. followed by agreement on practical arrangements.
Have told S.Ll. we want a Cab. discn., with him, at this point.
U.S. proposal of long adjournment – too dangerous. Brought down now to “inside a fortnight”. May be 2 weeks + this week-end.
Wd. give us chance to put a plan to other Heads of Govt.
* Propose Cab. on Monday a.m. Circulate some more tells. or summary of
* Prisecs. before week-end. At 10 a.m., if S.Ll. has to return.
RAB. R. proposal may, fr. their angle, have bn. designed to be helpful – at least not offensive.
[Enter Att.G.
3. Kenya : Hola Detention Camp.
A.L.B. Cab. decision of ’54. Has resulted in drastic redn. in nos. detained.
Debate in H/C. Propose to go back over long history of re-habilitation policy. In general a success : occasional lapses, wh don’t conceal, have bn. firmly dealt with. Over whole period, record is good.
K. We mustn’t let down K. Govr. in order to get out of pol. diffy. But at same time must not appear to take this incident lightly.
Must not prejudice discipl. procdgs. Shd. see how defendants develop their case re superiors before we announce any enquiry into their action.
Att.G. Sullivan &amp; C. gave evce. on oath before R. Mag. It wd. be inconsistent with that evce. for them now to say tht. Cowan ordered them to do what they did. Can therefore be said these procdgs. have no bearing on criticism of Cowan or Minister.
I had assumed Hola was isolated incident. Have now found lr of Cowan of 26 April ’57 – indicatg. that batons were used v. detainees at another camp. And this has bn. an exhibit. Shows that force was used on detainees : and cd. be read into Cowan plan.
Forcing detainees to work is breach of I.L.O. Convention. Circs. in which this has bn. done in K. cannot, I think, be related to emergency. Moreover, laying hands on them wd. amount to a technical assault.
All this, in a formal enquiry, will come out – and will reflect unfavourably on conduct &amp; policy of HMG. since ’54. I wd. therefore refuse enquiry. All facts known (save reasons why Minister approved C. plan : &amp; that can be ascertained before Tues. debate). Sullivan’s evce. in discipl. procdgs. can’t throw light on ( ). Deplore incident : but full investign. already made &amp; no further enquiry cd. throw more light. Deal only therefore with action of Minister and responsibility of Col. Secretary. Rpt. of disturbance on Thaila: repts. in Times’ y’day : will be thrown in A.L.B.’s teeth : can only be rebutted by record over whole period. Force : wd. prefer to treat it as form of physical therapy.
Shd. be in worse debating position after a further enquiry.
If satisf. explann. not f’coming fr. Minister, may be best tht. he shd.resign – before next Tuesday.
I.M. My Dpt. view is tht. ’53 K. Regs. were prob. in breach of Convention. Because of that O.L. brght matter to Cab. in ’54. Our view was tht. amended Reg. was defensible in I.L.O. – and hasn’t bn. questioned there. Further I.L.O. Convn. of ’37 was accepted only for U.K. because inconsistent with our action in Colonies.
Att.G. I dissent from that view of the legal posn.
R.A.B. Anyhow, Cowan’s language is not consistent with Convention.
Hail. Att.G.’s line can only be taken if we accept findings of Coroner. And they include : i) meaning of C.’s lr. was to give carte blanche ii) no adequate provn. in C. plan for supervision iii) scurvy in camp. iv) Campbell’s report was unsatisfactory – virtually untruthful. If we rest on that report, we must be ready to act on it : wh. implies action v. Cowan, Minister &amp; Campbell.
A.L.B. Have asked Minister why he approved C.’s plan and what he thght it meant.
P.M. 1) Press now seeing difficulties.
2) Our conscience can be clear. At outset, public criticism of K. Govt. was of in
3) Rehabilitation has, in general, bn. successful. Inevitable tht. there shd. be some recalcitrants &amp; propn. of these is higher as problem is solved. Shd. prs. have bn. realised tht. use of force wd. be more dangerous as they got down to hard core. Importance of small nos. sufficient action &amp; firmness.
4) We must stand by ’54 decision : can’t leave blame for that with K. Govr. Dangerous to have judicial enquiry into that
Tho’ we can say we didn’t contemplate forced labour wd. mean .
this
For future, new Cttee. must consider wtr remainder must just stay in detn. with no attempt at rehabilitation. form of force wd. be used.
5) If we decline enquiry, it must be because facts are known. What do they reveal? Deplorable incident. Not the first (Cowan’s 1957 incident). Await final picture fr. disc. procdgs. We will then take whatever admin’ve. action is necessary re past, and such review of policy &amp; practice as may be needed to prevent recurrence in future.
A.L.B. Happy to follow that course.
R.A.B. Public won’t tolerate action v. Sullivan and Coutts only. Are we prepared to take action against superiors – e.g. require resignation.
A.L.B. Minister is due to retire (age) in 4-6 weeks. [Exit Profumo.
I.M. Oppn. can mount a v. damaging case. Shd. we be v. flat in oppn. to further enquiry? – even tho’ we know it will reveal no new facts. Can we not say we don’t now exclude all possibility of enquiry.
Att.G. Nothg. can come out of disc. procdgs. to justify enquiry – nothing we don’t know now.
Hail. Convention. Difference betwn. requiring prs. to work and using violent means to make them do so.
P.M. Reserve the “don’t exclude enquiry” for 2nd. speech in H/C.
H.A. Case for it, since some new evce. emerges. Put it on basis that on facts now known, no case for further enquiry.
K. Final ques in Times leader. How do we put our posn. on that? Can’t appear ready to sack him w’out giving him chance to defend himself.
P.M. Must say – if we need further enquiry to be sure admin’ve action will be fair, we shall be ready to take it. Not a ranging enquiry.
* N.B. to look at relevant passages of A.L.B.’s speech.
Att.G. Amendment to motion?
E.H. Will consider this p.m. after 1922 mtg. [Exit A.L.B., Att.G.
4. Hilton Hotel, Park Lane.
H.B. Quoted ruling on “high bldg.” Alternative scheme made wh. goes as far as poss. to meet objns. 80 ft. lower.
But M/Works and Fine Arts Commn. are against it.
H.M. Qua amenities of R. Parks, my duty is to question this. F.A. Commn. accept towers, vice slabs, round Parks. And this, now is a tower. But risk tht. Parks will be surrounded by these : cf. Central Park in N. Yk.
H.A. London must go higher. Skyline is bound to change. Need for hotels, and they must in Ldn. be high.
N.Z. House : and St James’ Park.
CLOSED UNDER THE
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT 2000
P.M. “The highs have it.”</content>
