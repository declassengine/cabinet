  <content>C.C. 26 (59). 28th April, 1959
1. Germany : Manufacture of A.A. Guided Missiles. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Resolution in W.E.M. to permit German manufacture of A.A. guided missiles. Joint manufacture with Italy, France &amp; Benelux. Assume H.E. head.
D.S. This weapon is not designed for a nuclear head.
P.M. Moreover, we allowed them last year to make anti-tank guided missiles.
S.Ll. Two-thirds majority of Council is required for ballistic missiles and A.A. guided missiles etc.,
This is participation in joint manufacture : but amendment in form goes wider &amp; wd. enable them to produce on their own “short-range guided missiles for air defence”. But at least it is short-range.
D.S. We have bn. encouraging G. to engage in joint projects for manufactre. of this type of weapon – incldg. 30 m. range Army weapon. Cd. not that be covered at same time?
Not much security in requirement of joint prodn. e.g. a Dutch component.
S.Ll. Shd. we agree – on basis of assurance from G. that they are not going to build up long-range rocket industry.
D.S. If you fear they may get the know-how, Treaty doesn’t prevent their doing r. and d. – only manufacture.
S.Ll. Instruct out repve. to stall : no instructions : refer back. Give faint support to any quibbles raised by other Allies. Say we support Hawk project itself. Recognise that, if other Allies favour this, we may be outvoted.
D.S. x| Cd. we surmount present diffy. by agreeing that Hawk project is w’in existg.
| Treaty (i.e. is short-range). That would avert diffies.
Agreed : take opportunity for x/ if it offers.
2.
N.A.T.O. Deployment of Missiles in Europe.
S.Ll. Agreements re nuclear weapons between U.S. and various European countries. Have to lie before Congress for 60 days. Must be tabled soon-ish, to get approved before Congress rises. Herter inclined to think it better to table them before, vice
Awkward timing, in relation to Germany because zone of limitation idea. after, May 11th. Spaak is suggesting a NATO resolution referring back to decision of December ’57, from which this stems.
D.S. Different types of weapon : some are tactical only.
P.M. Tel. 1080 is helpful idea. Present it as N.A.T.O. affair, covering a group incldg. G., &amp; consequential on decision of December ’57.
Agreed.
3. Egypt. Financial Agreement.
S.Ll. Facilities offered are not satisfactory.
I favour accepting this, however, and continue to press for some improvement. Get our foot in the door. There are indications that they may improve on this.
P.M. Agree. Proceed empirically. De facto position is what matters.
H.A. Reluctantly, I agree with this course.
Approved.</content>
