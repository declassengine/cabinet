  <content>C.C. 37(59). 23rd June, 1959.
1. Berlin. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Welcome to S.Ll. Skill &amp; patience. Specially glad this has bn. recognised by world opinion.
S.Ll. W. proposals as tabled. Better presented. (Tuesday.) G. temporised before tabling his – to co-incide with K.’s speech. This was reported to be tough &amp; Allies became v. emotional. Seemed best in those circs. to play for recess.
Situation now. Each side is trying to get status quo, w’out abandoning real objectives.
Solidarity of W. is m’tained. But far from agreement on Berlin and on developmt. of relns. betwn 2 Germanies. No advance twds certainty of Summit – or its success.
Next task : i) seek to narrow gap betwn. our plan &amp; Soviet. Get U.S. to take lead in putting fwd. any compromise. ii) Convince U.S. re
No W. Summit. Wd. give impn. of anxiety. Ad. wd. need to come : &amp; he wd. freeze W. posn. Wd. need to be in Europe &amp; wd. therefore reduce E.’s willingness to attend 4-Power Summit. Summit. iii) Be sure what we can get out of it. Must try to achieve these in next 3 wks.
H.&amp;H. * Can we have F.O. memo. setting out last proposals &amp; comparing them? *
S.Ll. Yes. We may have to put out as W. Paper: all has bn. made public.
Choice - a) seek new permanent agreement &amp; pay price for it. But R. cd.
repudiate it, or bring econ. pressures on W. Berlin.
b) accept moratorium (preferably for 2½ years). Not certain we
shall be in weaker posn. then to make new agreement. Only price
for that = persuade 2 Germanies to talk.
P.M. At W. Summit F. &amp; G. wd. combine to bring pressure on U.S. We must therefore concentrate now on getting Anglo-U.S. agreed position. Either get E. to admit “progress” and fix a Summit date. Or get it agreed tht. ques to be reserved for Summit are i) no. of W. troops ii) period of moratorium iii) all is open for negotn. at end of moratorium. iv) status of discussions betwn. 2 Germanies : can they report to a future Summit. Summit for these ques after compromise plan settled by For. Ministers.
D.S. x| Hope Summit can also present machinery for discn of other subjects
| e.g. general disarmament.
P.M. It mght even settle the major points on nuclear tests conference – after
Can’t dissociate x/ from U.N. Cd. discuss machinery w’in U.N. de G. had left.
R.A.B. Need for education of Br. public opinion. S.Ll. shd. consider means.
S.Ll. Statement to-morrow in reply to a no. of P.Q.’s.
P.M. Debate prs. in week before F.M. Mtg. resumes – that Thursday.
Hail. Cd. F.O. &amp; Ch. Hill compose a puff for S.Ll.?
Ch.H. S.Ll. has come out pretty well in U.K. Press. I mght do more, on basis of S.Ll.’s statement to-morrow.
S.Ll. Press comments have sufficed – v. good.
2. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
3. Maldive Islands.
H. Gan is going well &amp; shd. be ready by early ’60. But fallen foul of Mali Govt. Shd. we get them here early or late. On balance I favour October.
P.M. What is point of negotiation?
H. To get agreement on Protection as well as lease of Gan, and get it all into one document.
D.S. Cd. we not get a lease longer than 30 years? What is our posn. at end?
H. In theory they cd. turn us out.
D.S. Then shd. we not try for 100 yr. lease?
H. Better stand on firm lease for 30 yrs. than on Protection Treaty, which they cd. say they no longer needed.
Hail. Cd. we not buy outright?
H. So far they have rejected that. Difficult to find anyone to negotiate with.
P.M. Let them come in September.
Make a proper plan of negotiation before they come.
4. Nuclear Power Programme.
M. Plainly right. But may be criticised i) because of decline in coal ii) amenity and nature conservancy grds.
On i) we must go fwd. with nuclear power &amp; defend it – despite diffies. of coal-mining industry.
On ii) these points have bn. considered by insprs. at hearing.
H.B. I accept my insprs’ recommns. But his report (to be published) includes El. Bd. statement re need for nuclear as well as coal, which can be exploited by amenity fans. Agree, however, we must approve.
L.P. Dungeness is largest unit of land wh. has grown out of sea – and this will destroy its value as such. This will upset scientists.
D.E. Serious effects on exports if we cut this p’mme because of coal.
H.A. Since ’57 capital cost &amp; running costs have risen. Latter are now 40% above conventional stations. Shd. we construct any more Mk. I. stations? Mk. II will be more economical. Is keeping consortia together a sufficient reason for going on with Mk. I.
M. Cost of nuclear stations and fuel is dropping. We shd. be v. ill-advised to disperse the teams. Capital cost is 3 times : operating cost is only ⅓rd. of conventional.
P.M. We depend on skill. We have backed this enterprise. Folly to w’draw now. Can’t fall back on coal-age.
D.E. Too many consortia?
M. Yes : 5 : hard to employ them all.
Memo. approved. Announce in H/L. debate.
5. Industrial Disputes: Printing.
I.M. 200.000 involved. Large loss of man-days. Little comment in Press because they are nervous of ink supplies. Little interest in H/C. Men reluctant to accept arbitn. because think they wd. do better in negotiation. Men’s leaders include 2 bad men, of whom one (Willis) is Chairman of T.U.C. The other is prob. a Communist. Spear-head of demand for 40 hr. week.
Eventually, they will have to talk. Some of smaller unions can’t afford a long strike. Tho’ large ones cd. &amp; may go it alone. Ct. of Enquiry won’t be favoured because unhappy experience of this in printing trade.
Shall continue to do nothing pro. tem.
6. S. G. Brown Ltd. [Enter Selkirk.
S. Have wanted to sell for years. P’poned because high Bank rate. Started active steps last autumn. Not a true Admy. propn. : much of their work is commercial. Wd. cost us £1 M. over 5 years to keep it going.
Mrs. Brown : little connn. with business as it is now. Running a Zoo at Sidmouth.
Can make plain conditions on which we are prepared to sell.
R.A.B. Tories want to be sure original owner has chance to re-buy. Can’t give her more than opportunity to buy at market price. Hope we will do that.
K. Merely to bring it to Mrs. Brown’s attention will conform to our policy on land.
E.H. They may say it shd. be offered on a valuation, not on competitive tender.
H.A. Cd. you not extract from her a lr. saying she doesn’t want to buy.
K. Business now is quite different from what we bought.
M. Cd. we not find guidance from precedents – on firms, not land.
R.M. We must be able to say we are getting best possible price – fr. that angle we must rely on competitive tender.
P.M. Ty. with Admy. shd. draw up conditions. Then notify Mrs. B. &amp; ask if she wants to make a competitive bid.
P.M. to see – also draft of lr. to Mrs. Brown. [Exit S.
7. Distribution of Industry.
D.E. Diffy. over Cotton Bill will be – how do we propose to re-deploy labour displaced? We are about to review D.I. policy, on basis of a report by officials. Will it be wise, in this debate, to disclose an intention to revise D.I. policy in next Parliament. We know Labour Party will produce a new plan. We think we can improve on that.
I.M. I wd. favour holding our fire. Cotton Bill has gone well, and we can bring it to port w’out this aid. Our strength is that we legislate – they only promise.
Don’t anticipate results of our consideration of D.I. policy.
Agreed : don’t say anything to-day.</content>
