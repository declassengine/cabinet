  <content>C.C. 28(59). 5th May, 1959
1. Cabinet Proceedings. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Concerned at publicity given to Cab. discn. on space research.
Hope Ministers will be more careful. Ch. Pincher.
Hail. D.T. was even more serious. Am making enquiries &amp; composing a minute.
2.
Germany. Paris Meeting of W. Powers.
S.Ll. Agreement on opening posn. of W. Powers. This is not v. courageous, and includes proposals we know R. will reject. But some improvement (qua
German delegn. friendly, but Adenauer v. rigid. flexibility) on 1955 position. Formuln. is wide enough to include all our ideas. Spaak thinks we have lost nothing.
P.M. No real agreement on posn. we wd. take when the real crunch comes. Right to avoid discussing that in advance – because leaks wd. weaken Western position.
3.
Egypt : Financial Agreement.
S.Ll. Want to minimise complaint. See how we go. May improve. Shall tell Black, however, we think E. have not shown good faith. He is best able to influence E.
4.
Iraq.
H. Hope we are ready to deal firmly with Iraq if it goes Communist &amp; stops oil supplies.
S.Ll. More likely development is civil war or break-down of government.
M. No oil crisis unless it spread to Kuwait. We cd. manage w’out Iraq oil.
P.M. Ruler has indicated that he wd. ask for help. That gets over 1st. hurdle.
5. Aircraft Industry : Dakota Replacement. [Enter A.J., G.W.
P.M. Diffy. of M/S. in forecasting future of industry &amp; its markets. Helped by C.A. Cttee. on policy. But Cab. must consider this.
Policy declared : Govt. help to be confined to research &amp; major new development. Do we depart from this to extent of aiding this type, wh. is not a new developmt. w’in meaning of that policy.
A.J. Can we export w’out a home order? My final concln. : support neither. Manner of support. BEA have 20 or so Dakotas : they have another 10 years life &amp; don’t want to replace them. Only means of support is that I shd. buy
new type (3), lend them to B.E.A., &amp; pay them extra cost as cpd. with existing Dakotas. They are putting same propn. on Rotodyne.
ii) Not convinced we can’t export w’out home order. Folland Gnat was sold to India w’out it. Viscount replacement: T.C.A. may be willing to be first user. This wd. be jeopardised if we accepted on smaller type view tht. must have home order to catch export orders.
iii) Two types. Invidious to choose betwn. them.
M. Idea of supporting H.P. Herald was raised in ’58 &amp; has bn. discussed 6 times by my Cttee. Govt. finance was not excluded merely because no home order in prospect.
This is essentially a problem of Govt. agency helping to prove a new type. Can be regarded as extension of r. and d.
Shd. it be given to more than one type? Yes. Little difference betwn. them. But H.P. have spent £3 M. on this : &amp; it is flying. £1M. wd. help them to capture export orders. But ready to agree to similar help for Avro type. Money spent cd. be recovered in sales.
P.M. First ques : is it right to support a Dakota replacement?
H.W. Cttee. is only way of resolving these diff. problems. There are other Dpl. interests to be taken into a/c.
P.M. But Dpl. Minister must be free to reserve his posn. for ultimate decision by Cabinet. Coll. responsibility of Cab. must be preserved.
H.W. Position of B.E.A. Corpns. must make profits if they can. But B.E.A. to do so are right to use Dakotas as long as possible &amp; then to use old Viscounts. That doesn’t help M/Supply. Any subsidy wd. go to firm, from M.Supply, not to B.E.A.
A.J. I accepted the principle, but when I see the means, I doubt the wisdom.
H.W. Same diffy. will arise on Rotodyne. BEA won’t take financial [Enter R.A.B.
responsibility for proving it.
H.M. Real ques : is home order essential prepn. for export sales? If that is answered in affirmative, we can get round problem of means. Erroll was constrained to answer in affirmative.
Impressed by A.J.’s argument re dangerous precedent. We ought to take a line on ques of principle. If we decide affirmatively, we shall be expected to do it for all – not only for new generation.
K. What is the prize? 250 aircraft at £83 M.
M. Possibly £80 M. – arrived at differently.
D.E. On ques of principle : must be v. diff. to sell aircraft which hasn’t bn. proved.
A.J. Can be proved by foreign operator. We have exported w’out home order. Also what is value of artificially contrived home order?
H. N.Z. wd. buy Heralds, but won’t place first order.
India wd. buy Avros if
These replies suggest a home order they had full backing of H.M.G.
is necessary.
A.J. India wd. not make this a condition. Australia wdn’t buy, even if we had placed home order.
D.S. Why do this at all? Why do we support aircraft industry – defence, prestige, export earnings?
Doubt if Govt. support has earned a dividend in the past.
P.M. U.S. subsidise their aircraft &amp; shipbldg industries openly. We can’t carry our industry on basis of mil. orders. Do we want to m’tain airframe industry. Will our engines persist w’out it.
Earlier policy of limited support – for novel types only. Are we to go further? That is the first question. Means (i) money : cheap supply of first models : (ii) who is to prove them, as first operator? (iii) can you get export orders for aircraft you don’t buy yourself?
M. x/ Believe we shall lose engine industry if we have no air-frame industry.
I.M. No doubt we should give support. Ques : is how?
R.A.B. Nor have I.
A.J. I don’t accept x/. Even so, I favour an air-frame industry. Policy announced was right in the main – tho’ we may have to make some departures. We shall have to do so for Rotodyne &amp; for Viscount replacement. But this is too small – and means are too difficult.
Herald. We declined to support its development. Shd. we now subsidise sales.
D.E. This is a special case because large no. of Dakotas to be replaced. The export potential is so large.
D.S. Don’t accept H.P. estimate of sales. No future for H.P. as a firm.</content>
