  <content>C.C.4(59). 3rd February, 1959.
1. Europe.
P.M. Movement for re-appraisal. Dulles’ visit. Responsibility of U.K.
I have therefore accepted out-standing invitns. to visit Moscow. – to take opportunity of reconnaissance.
Diff. for me to visit W’ton w’out offending French. Easier to do so after a visit to Moscow. I wd. also visit, briefly, Bonn &amp; Paris. And cd. go on to W’ton if that still seems advisable, after Dulles’ visit.
This wd. put us in better position to face 4 Power Mtg in spring or summer.
Reasons for visit i) Berlin problem is acutely dangerous.
ii) W. Alliance is creaking : time for U.K. initiative.
iii) May get some clue to R. attitude.
S.Ll. No chance of getting agreed W. posn. on Berlin given by early April. Must fill this vacuum. This visit may calm the situation.
H.A. Welcome this initiative.
ALB. So do I.
P.M. Announcement Thursday. Tels. to-day to Bonn, Paris, W’ton &amp; Doms. Inform N.A. Council Wed. a.m.
R.A.B. Mght be better to announce on Wedy.
S.Ll. Before P.M. sees Dulles? Wiser not.
2. Egypt : Financial Agreement.
S.Ll. D.A. went to W’ton. Black was not aware of situation .....
[Enter K. Redmayne.
3. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
4. Balance of Payments.
H.A. 31m debit – E.P.U. Despite that we end month with 15 M. net increase.
Rate 2.80¼ has risen to 2.81.
First month of convertibility has therefore bn. satisfactory.
5. Horticulture.
H.A. Conflict is between para 4(b) and 5(a). Concln. of E.P.C. – para 7. M/Ag. and I have met Parly. Cttee. on Agric. They were v. angry. Can’t accept our view tht. no economic case has bn. established. They believe we have bn.
concerned only with Eur. F.T.A. repercussions. We have denied that – but haven’t apparently convinced them. Their advocacy is concentrated on tomatoes. Wd. a concession on flowers appease them? They also argue that grants scheme can’t have effect for 2 years – &amp; that is true.
J.H. They are angry. So are Lee Valley growers, whom I have seen. They can’t be convinced tht. our decn. was taken on economic grds.
Concession on flowers wd. be some compensn. for decision on tomatoes. Believe our costs have risen more than competitors (30% cpd. with 22%). And on carnations 50% increase in value of imports. And on other flowers tariff is below average &amp; cd. be raised.
We may have to review policy on horticulture – e.g. twds minimum prices with exclusion of imports when price falls below that level.
This is a powerful lobby.
H.A. Tomatoes – cd. we offer to negotiate fresh basis for support on basis of minimum import. Wd. be easier qua Europe – some of them do this sort of thing.
D.E. Can you have a cut-off of imports with perishables?
P.M. You cd. relate tariff increase to a minimum price.
R.A.B. Can’t defend this position politically. Must look for concession on tomatoes.
J.H. Politically. I wd. like to increase flower tariff (e.g. 25%) &amp; examine H.A.’s idea of a new form of tariff for tomatoes – wh. mght also extend to some other horticultural products.
P.M. Must adjourn this discussion.
[Enter Selkirk : Att.G
6. Territorial Waters.
S.Ll. As in memo.
J.H. Agree.
A.L.B. Defence importance = of air passage.
Att.G. Accept memo. But no real progress is likely w’out high-level talks with India &amp; Canada. On fishing.
S.Ll. Will consider wtr we shd. send personal message.
S. C.O.S. are satisfied with memo. Agree with ALB. – but we shan’t get it in Conference therefore best hope is to continue to over-fly in order to establish prescriptive rights.</content>
