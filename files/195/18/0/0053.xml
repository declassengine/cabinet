[Enter G.W., J.A.
2. Cyprus.
S.Ll. Tension has eased – both in H/C. and in Cyprus. No sign of early b’down. But still want to bring matters to a head – &amp; propose tht. J.A. shd. go to Cyprus on Sunday to resume talks on Monday.
Have informed G. &amp; T. Govts. that this is our plan.
Must now prevent G. &amp; T. communities fr. joining forces v. us.
P.M. Discussed this last p.m. &amp; went thro’ outstanding points. Agree we must clear all these before doing a deal on size of bases.
May have to mobilise G. &amp; T. Govts. to drive it through.
[Exit G.W. &amp; J.A.
3. Federation of Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland.
P.M. Welensky’s repns. : Shawcross – Lagos – protection of witnesses. We got him round on all those points. Deferred Banda until after my visit to Nyasaland. I was gravely disturbed by attitude of Adminn. there. Govr.’s view : must have constitutional talks, must be with B., but B. mustn’t be released in N. In Salisbury I cdn’t clinch this – at social dinner – tho’ I warned them we wd. have to release B. When our plan was disclosed from Ldn. to W., there was explosion. Demand for mtg., in Salisbury or Ldn. On balance better for H. to go out to Salisbury.
Set out orally points made in note : para. 2 onwards.
To 3. added : responsibility for security in N. rests with Govr. &amp; Col. Secy. But Fedn. &amp; 2 other territories have an interest and right to be consulted because contiguous &amp; liable to be called on for re-inforcements.
To 4. Welensky’s interest is to see advance in N. in order to gain confidence of Africans in Fedn. &amp; thus give chance of ultimate independence of Fedn. Whitehead’s interest may
No doubt this is sensible course. But W. &amp; W. will be difficult, and can quote Armitage in their support. And Home is nervous of re-actions in N. Rhodesia. Must therefore warn Cabinet tht. H.’s talk will be v. difficult : and we may be faced with intransigence. be different.
Can’t be sure they wdn’t act rashly : another American situation might arise. Viz., choice : accept their view &amp; continue B.’s detention (being publicly known to have surrendered to them) : or Whitehead flinging out into unilateral
decln. of independence or union with S. Africa. We may have to be prisoners of Welensky or Ld. North.
Welensky is dependent on Europeans, mainly in S. Rhodesia. His posn. is a shadow cpd with that of W’head. And W’head has only small majority over an un-liberal opposition.
H. Grave situation – white popn. is near panic. W’head, tho’ Liberal, has to appease Dom. Party.
Fair chance of getting agreement on constitutional points – in both territories. B. is much more difficult : esp. as Armitage agreeswith them. We shall be acting in face of all Govts. They may insist on detn. until May, when M. Commn. have left.
Hail. If we went ahead, wd. they grumble – or act?
H. They say they won’t be driven further.
I.M. Agree : as long as all hang together. This must be a package. We can’t make our concessions &amp; then be faced with veto re Banda. P’ponemt. of N. advance until after 1960 review : no disclosure to B. of his being in their delegation. If they veto B.’s release, we must w’draw these other offers.
H.W. Prs. cdn’t stage troops into Fedn. thro’ Kano – to hold down Africans.
I.M. Govr. felt he wd. prefer U.K. troops to Rhod. police or territorials. But we now think we ought to use B.S.A. Police.
R.A.B. May have to extend B.’s detention for a time, in order to avoid a row.
x/ Or Nyasaland conference soon in Ldn.
Believe H. will need more room for manoeuvre.
I.M. x/ wdn’t work. B. cd. leave at will. M. Commn. wd. look v. foolish. Ready to have mtgs. in Ldn. later.
Directive approved. H. to report if he needs greater latitude.
4. Nigeria.
No note taken.
5. Uganda.
I.M. Universal adult suffrage – prob. inevitable, but want to delay announcement until about June to avoid embarrassment elsewhere.
Attitude of Kabaka. He dislikes all this because threat to posn. of chiefs. There is risk of security trouble from him. But fear we must take that risk.
P.M. Do avoid “one man one vote”.</content>
