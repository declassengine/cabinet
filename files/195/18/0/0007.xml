  <content>C.C. 11(59). 19th February, 1959.
1. Egypt : Financial Agreement. [Enter R.A.A., Redmayne.
H.A. Black is willing to go to Cairo but wants to indicate tht. we are ready to conclude an agreement – because Nasser is to make public speech on Saturday in which he mght. otherwise explode &amp; repudiate the negotiations.
Alternative risk tht. he mght. make ultimatum in speech – sign or else.
R.A.A. S.Ll. prefers to send message.
P.M. Clear that we shall have to sign, on best terms we can get. Trade, in the end, is more important than money. We must, however, expect a row here politically.
Agreed : accept this situation and leave it to Black to play the hand as
he wishes.
P.M. Shd. we also make public announcement that Erroll is standing by to go out to sign. If Black agrees. To follow his statement, on departure, that he is going to Cairo to clear up misunderstandings before signature of agreement.
2. Cyprus.
P.M. Complex negotiations yesterday. In p.m. Makarios indicated he cdn’t accept Zurich agreement as a firm basis. He has made no objn. to our declaration. His points were : veto, taxation, right to re-intervene. S.Ll. therefore concluded the mtg. on basis tht. M. wd. give his answer this a.m.
M. has now said he will accept. Full conference at 3 p.m. attended by P.M.’s (if Menderes is fit to attend).
Looks v. hopeful. Gks. have stood firm. They are v. angry with M. for he had accepted Zurich plan.
We are now discussing with G &amp; T. the continuing machinery to work out details. – in an orderly manner.
Timing of announcement will have to be agreed with G. &amp; T.
Ques may be raised of Cyprus’ future assocn. with Commonwealth. If so, we will use formula agreed with C.R.O. Agreed.
3. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.</content>
