  <content>C.C. 62 (59).
10th December, 1959
1. Parliament. [Enter M.R.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
Christmas Recess – dates.
2. Education.
D.E. Report by Crowther – about to be published. Want time for Ministers to study it.
R.A.B. Problem especially of 17 yr. old etc. May be case for reviewing Univ. educn. Cd. we get Crowther retained for this purpose. Want to avoid R. Commn.
D.E. Universities are suspicious of C. because of U.S. contacts. But Universities expect a further lead on Univ. expansion.
Pro. tem. hope Ministers will refrain from making statements on school-leaving age etc.,
M’while Sub. Cttee. of H.A.C. will consider policy.
3. Road Traffic.
E.M. Oppn. will press for legn. – to enable Pink Zone etc., to be perpetuated. I need it : at least enabling Bill for a Pink Zone. But no room Leg. P’mme.
R.A.B. May have to do it. I support, in general, prospect of legn. – also fines on the spot &amp; traffic wardens.
Agreed : in debate to-day, don’t exclude possibility of early legn.
4. Nuclear Tests.
S.Ll. R. scientists have not shaken U.S. posn. on technical side. But, politically, U.S. delegn. are now v. keen on a Treaty. Signs tht. U.S. military are going to be told that there is not substantial mil. advantage in further tests.
On balance, this looks more hopeful.
[Enter J.M.
[Enter B-C.
5. Old Age Pensions.
M.R. Have asked Oppn. if Bill can be deferred until after Xmas. But haven’t had a reply.
K. Public most influenced by a vote. Better therefore to let Bill come in and block it.
B-C. If leave is given, hopes will be aroused. I wd. prefer to out-vote the motion. We took similar action before Election.
P.M. Wd. that preclude us fr. introducg. our own Bill in same Session?
M.R. No.
R.A.B. Prefer to out-vote the motion. [Exit B-C
Agreed : out-vote it : [Parly. Secy. M/P. not to speak.]
6. Civil Aviation: Scottish Aviation Ltd. [Enter G.W, Alport
D.S. No alternative but to order Beavers.
J.M. Don’t dissent. Contrary decn. wd. lead to w’drawal of m’tenance. work on Sabres.
P.M. On defence &amp; finance grounds Beaver aircraft must be preferred.
G.W. Para 3 (c) We cd. justify ordering another 4. Agreed : examine with Ty.
H.W. Can tell Canadian M/Def. in confidence, next week. Release public announcement covering Beaver and Pioneer.
E.H. Worried at future of firm – many highly-skilled people. Emplt. is much worse in Prestwick than in Chester.
x/ Can we secure firm promise of continuance of m’tenance work.
H.W. I will try x/ with Canadian M/Defence.
Agreed. H.W. to explore in Paris.
[Exit G.W., Alport.
[Enter Att.G.
7.
Interception of Communications.
R.A.B. a) Must defend right of police to listen with consent of subscriber
b) Mght inform police they can’t disclose w’out consultn. with H.O. (?).
On Crown privilege : I’m clear we shdn’t extend it (?).
But public anxiety will be increased by establmt. of further tribunals. L.O.’s etc., are all v. extension of privilege. They prefer proposal in my memo. : leave of court before issue of sub-poena. This wdn’t exclude claim of privilege at first line of defence. Wd. mean legn. (short) or alteration of rules of court. G.M.C. have had powers w’out complaint for 100 years.
K. a) public are worried by using informn. for difft. purpose.
b) extension of Crown privilege wd. involve increasing arbitrary power which is already v. unpopular.
c) in reln. to disciplinary tribunals, let High Ct. have a discretion re sub-poena.
P.M. Who wd. object? Not police : nor Mrs. X (in this case). Is there any real protection?
Ch.H. Cd. any person aggrieved appeal v. grant of sub-poena.
Att.G. Disciplinary tribunals are not best people to decide wtr evce. shd. be w’held. Ct. wd therefore have to give leave for sub-poena in each case. Police cd. object in improper cases : and advice to police cd. be given by H.O.
R.A.B. Cd. defence have right to appear at High Ct. hearing?
Att.G. Fairness of evce. cd. only be considered by disciplinary tribunal.
K. Then consider preventg. disc. tribunals from issuing sub-poenas to police. Objns. a) distinguishes betwn. police &amp; others b) leaves whole discretion to police.
Att.G. You cd. provide for notice to other parties when appln. for sub-poena is made.
General approval for this plan. But can it be adjusted so as to ensure that
defence has some say.
Resume discussion.
[Exit R.A.B., S.Ll. M.R. Enter M/Power
8.
Fuel Policy.
R.W. Dominated by diffies of coal industry.
Diffies. of alternatives, if coal targets aren’t reached – tho’ we can’t judge wtr NCB. aims are right until about spring. Closing more pits or short-term working : or raising stocks still higher. Must give notice now of these risks, which may mature in the spring.
M. Endorse memo. and also R.W.’s warning. Later, in spring, we may have to review posn.
H.W. Publicity for oil-burning (domestic) is alarming.
H.A. Alarmed at stock posn. Fearful for spring. But agree we can’t take any decision now. Reserve my posn. on taxn. of oil.
H. Para. 5. Review of nuclear p’mme shd. wait on technical decns. now procdg. betwn. AEA. and M/Power.
R.W. Agree to this, as a gloss on H.P.C. decision.
R.M. Export orders may rise.
D.E. Right to tell N.C.B. to take the competn. of oil. But in cotton we helped the industry to modernise. In coal, shd. we similarly spend money in helping them to adapt to modern condns.
Memo. – approved.
[Exit R.W.
