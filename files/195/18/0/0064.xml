  <content>C.C. 25 (60). 11th April, 1960
1. British Somaliland. [Enter P., M.R., Profumo
P. Resolution was passed before instructns. reached Govr. Suggn. now is that repves. shd. be invited to come &amp; discuss in Ldn. This has bn. approved – and Govr. will announce it this p.m.
M’while, answers to P.Q.’s – to reassure Ethiopia.
2.
Sierra Leone.
P. Delegation coming to discuss ‘next constitutional advance’ – which must be independence, for they have had all short of that. Contiguous territories of about same size are independent. They cd. be economically viable if they can control illicit diamond trade. (£11 M. p.a. illicit)
K. I accept concln. in C.P.C. (60) b. Awkward because of viability : but refusal wd. cause trouble in that part of the world.
H.W. Defence agreement – Freetown and overflying – can be simplified.
P. Financial aid £1½ M. p.a. on tapering basis. Need not be more in independence : aim to run them off into financial independence.
H.A. Para 10. Keep to wording agreed with Ty.
On defence – no payment for facilities : quid pro quo for helping with their defence.
P.M. Draw up (C.O., Ty. and M/D.) short memo of directions for conference, for approval. – incldg. ques wtr we shd. give assurances of defence.
Also prospects of iron-ore exports (? to Iscor).
3. Road Programme. [Enter Erroll
E.M. Density of traffic worst in world. Threatened by increased no. of cars – sales continue to rise. Alarming picture. We must have better road – or fewer cars. Hence my p’mme to ’64, which can be paid for by users. We shd. start this summer : road work in designated areas or with men from those areas. This wd. require more money this year.
H.A. Admit the problem. Can’t give any money this year – or promise any for the future until we have reviewed forward p’mme capital &amp; recurrent. At end/May.
This year : apart from £322 M. increase in Estimates I can foresee £70-80 M. more on Guillebaud, Pilkington, C.S. &amp; Univ. salaries. The existing p’mme represents greatly increased expenditure – £76.5 M increase of 23% over last year. This argument applies to designated areas too – we have allotted as much as we can afford to them already. Anyway local emplt. is small.
H.B. Not in N.W. Wales.
E.M. Or elsewhere on small jobs.
J.M. Scotland’s special problem. Roads to match increased tourist trade. Using largely local men and materials.
I cd. do £3M. more by way of authorisations (w’out adding to expend’re in current year).
As mine is area of higher unemplt., can’t I proceed selectively.
E.M. If Ford’s go to Lpl., there will be no road for them.
H.B. Need for more planning &amp; analysis. Congestion because more cars will be mainly in towns. Only £400 M. is to be spent there, on this plan – £1100 M. on country routes. Is this sense? Is there a proper balance?
Also, do these thro’ roads benefit the areas which we shd. make more attractive to industry? Further analysis on that point seems to be needed.
E.M. Yes because by-pass the towns.
H.W. Existing p’mme can’t proceed at planned rate w’out more money. M/T. will be heavily criticised on that a/c.
H.B. We met the schools bulge and the houses on borrowing. We can’t expect to overcome gap on roads &amp; hospitals out of revenue, as now.
Hail. Why shd. we pay from revenue because roads do pay dividend – in production etc.,
P.M. Not an identifiable yield. Why not tolls?
E.M. Only on bridges. On roads too many points of access – manning wd. be excessive.
M. Need for roads is as obvious as was the need for houses.
E.M. In E &amp; W. I cd. spend another £10 M. this year.
J.M. And £3 M for me.
H.A. I cdn’t authorise any more money this year. We must lose this summer.
D.E. From now on transport will be more expensive in U.K. than elsewhere because we are more crowded country. Appalling increase of private cars – damage to b/p. because steel, oil, f. holidays etc.,
Shd. we not gear this p’mme more to industrial than to private needs?
H.W. We have – e.g. by M.1. vice Ldn. to Brighton.
P.M. We cd. increase taxation for this purpose. But cd. we do this p’mme w’out risk of inflation – save in some parts of the country.
R.A.B. Politics. H/C. anxiety at present re expenditure. Wish we could develop toll system? Relation o f expend’re to G.N.P. is what will tell in H/C : is there any hope of giving a satisf. answer on that.
H.W. a) £50 M. cap. exp’re will yield tolls therefore cd. go below line.
b) C. Licence &amp; private cars cd. carry higher tax.
H.A. Can’t do a) without moving Estate Duty below the line. (£230M.)
D.E. G.N.P. won’t wear both cars and roads. Country will have to choose. We ought to consume less and invest more. But we don’t.
M. Increasing use of private cars to go to work. You can’t distinguish therefore between industrial &amp; private.
P.M. i) We must discriminate in favour of designated areas, when it’s our policy to expand industry. Can’t we isolate these?
ii) Cd. we get ahead with preliminaries to an increase in 1961/62 – so as to be sure that it can be done.
E.M. L.a.’s wd. be encouraged to buy the land : unwise to do that unless sure we were going ahead.
H.A. But this cd. be examined.
E.M. It isn’t the bottle-neck, in the main : we have planned, and we are now held up for lack of cash.
P.M. In analysis, we must give priority to industrial needs.
D.E. What effect on rlways?
E.M. Can’t tell yet.
H.A. But clear that we can’t do all of what is intended for both roads and rlways.
E.M. Look at App. C. How can I defend that v. motor interests?
D.E. We are going to be faced with the ques wtr we shall restrict consumption in order to make more room for investment. By increased saving – compulsory or voluntary.
P.M. But large Budget surpluses discourage voluntary savings.
D.E. Pray in aid greater understanding by people of cost to b/p. of more motor transport.
P.M. In view of Budget can’t ask Ch/Ex. to find more money for this year.
x| But i) analyse road needs of new plants in Merseyside etc., and plan ahead for
| that : complete all preliminaries.
M. But we know already of existing congestion wh. ought to be relieved. This is a motor age – we can’t avoid it.
H.B. Progress with i) wd. reduce some existg. congestions. Agreed
Wait for May review. : proceed with x/.
J.M. Hope tht. in future we can work on 10 yr., vice 4 yr., basis.</content>
