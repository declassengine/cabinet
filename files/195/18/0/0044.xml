  <content>C.C. 57(59). 10th November, 1959.
1. Parliament. [Enter M.R.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
2. Kenya. [Enter Att.G.
I.M. Explained plan of ending Emergency and introducing local legn. empowering Govr. to take less extreme semi-emergency measures.
Amnesty. 4.000 in prison, detentn. or subject to restriction orders. This plan will reduce them to 1.000. Convicts will be released or moved into detention. Of detainees &amp; restrictees, 500 will be freed by end of year.
Offences by officials or loyalists. Procdgs. wd. have affected
x/ Minister for African Affairs (Johnston). Att.G., Kenya, has now decided not
Presentn. : concentrate on relinquishing powers not on retaining some. to prosecute.
Corresponding statement in H/L.
Att.G. Suggest retention of 1st. sentence of para. 2 on p. 2.
Worried at final para. on p. 2. Final sentence shd. at least be omitted. Emphasis will draw attention to offences of mal-treatment in detention camps.
[Exit Att.G.
3. Supply of Arms : Central America.
S.Ll. Repns. to Cubans have had some effect. They recognise we can’t decide for a few day. This gives chance to make reasoned reply to Herter.
Cubans have a mission in Czecho.
4. Federation of Rhodesia etc.,
H. Recalled – Rhodesia wdn’t accept U.K. Commn. : insisted on their being represented. This meant a large body. Circulated list of proposed members.
I.M. Nyasaland : African members not yet fixed. Govr. hopes to get these men to ser.
H. Fedn. Parlt. rises for Xmas recess on 19/xi.
x/ And we have yet to settle the Privy Councillors. (6).
P.M. Want all the others settled before I tackle Opposition on x/ – asking for suggestions. Method of approach to H.G. – part letter, part talk. He will object a) Africans are not convicts therefore not repve. b) not clear from t. of r. tht. Commn. can discuss secession. On a) I shall say witnesses can come from prison. On b) I must say tht., as this is preparatory to statutory commn., we must keep w’in statute – but witnesses can range widely in evidence &amp; cd. cover secession.
R.A.B. Believe they want to come in. On b) they want Commn. to be free to recommend link alternative to Fedn.
I.M. Agree. Shepherd’s name will make it diff. for them to stand out. But R.A.B.’s b) is v. important. Hope we can offer some hope on that. Banda’s people (Cherwa?) wants Labour co-opn. : he stresses the importance of (b), Phrase in P.M.’s lr. on this is v. important.
H. No repve. of our Liberal Party.
P.M. If Labour refuse co-opn., is it agreed we go on? Agreed.
I.M. I agree. But 2 Govrs. feel that, without Labour, we might get African boycott.
[Exit M.R.
5. Nuclear Tests: Sahara.
S.Ll. L. Americans have tabled amendments to Afro-Asian resoln. &amp; greatly improved it.
This will prob. be followed by further Afro-Asian amendments.
Time has come to indicate tht. we wd. vote v. original Afro-Asian.
Posn. of other countries : U.S. will vote against. Canada may abstain, on strong form. Belg./Italy will vote against – &amp; prs. Holland &amp; Luxembourg. Scans. prob. abstain. Portugal against.
I wd. like to vote v. extreme resoln. : persuade as many as possible to abstain on mitigated resoln. (France not participating). If we cd. keep with U.S. &amp; Six on that basis, we shd. be alright. But we shd. be in diffy. if U.S., France &amp; Six all wanted to vote v. moderate form of resoln.
I.M. On reflectn., I believe we must vote v. extreme resolution. Hope O.G. will include in speech appropte. reference to anxieties in Africa.
On milder form, wd. like to abstain – on basis tht. it’s meaningless.
P.M. Instruct O.G. to have regard to character of resoln. &amp; its supporters. If most friends are v. extreme resoln. we also must vote v. it. On milder form, we can abstain if we can persuade a no. of friends to do the same.
We must not cast a lone vote v. French.
6. Government Expenditure.
H.A. Warning of diffies. ahead. All Ministers shd. cut back Estimates. Object of policy : to reduce Govt. exp’re as %age of G.N.P.
With inflation checked, revenue shd. be less buoyant. No sign that public expend’re is dropping automatically on that a/c.
P.M. All Ministers i/c Dpts. must do their best.
H.B. Much is due to policy decns. desired by our supporters – e.g. more hospital bldg, education etc.,
D.E. Youth service – pledge.
H.A. But they wish, simultaneously, to see taxation reduced.</content>
