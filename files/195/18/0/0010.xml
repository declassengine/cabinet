  <content>C.C. 16(59). 11th March, 1959.
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.
R.A.B. Monday : Egyptian settlement. Spokesmen : H.A. and P.M.
Wed/Thurs. Consol. Fund Bill. Debates on Cyprus &amp; unemployment. Cyprus on Thursday. ALB. and RAB. Unemplt. Wed. D.E. &amp; I.M.
2. Nyasaland.
A.L.B. Note on facts is being circulated.
Anxiety re security for some months past. Officer sent out from Security Service. Govr., in view of his report, deferred declaring state of emergency until more troops available. I did not discourage Govr. &amp; decln. was made.
Bad faith of Dr. Banda – who knew Perth was coming to agree on a more liberal constitn. but, despite that, did not restrain his people. The revolt, however, went off prematurely : was designed to follow what they wd. have represented as unsatisf. offer by Perth.
Parly. situation here – aggravated by our inability to disclose full knowledge tht. a plot was afoot. Also by refraining fr. saying sitn. was made worse by Accra Conference – because don’t want to give offence to Nkrumah.
Chance of disorder in Tanganyika now put at evens. Trouble in Kenya. All seems to stem from Accra.
Stonehouse incident – also represented as due to Fedn. influence.
Benson is under pressure fr. Fedn. to declare emergency in N. Rhodesia. Want to avoid that. Elections on 20/3 – valuable experiment.
Finally, demand for Parly. enquiry. 50 deaths to date. In a Colony I wd. have ordered some kind of enquiry. But Labour Party are gunning for Fedn.
Suggesting tht. Perth shd. interrupt his tour to go to Fedn. terries. Cd. ask him to consider need of enquiry &amp; form of it : and say it is being considered. Shd. be limited to Pr. Councillors.
H. Stemmed from Accra.
Labour loath Fedn. &amp; want to break it. But nervous now of feelings they have unloosed.
Somethg. to be said for enquiry if it cd. be limited to events in Nyasaland.
For constitutional review in 1960, I wd. prefer a R. Commn. to prepare opinion – here and there.
R.A.B. Favour enquiry wh. does not encroach on Fedn. ques. Must avoid open row with Welensky.
A.L.B. One man (like Radcliffe) or (2nd. best) three P.C.’s.
Hail. x/ Publish in W. Paper as much informn. as possible. Avoid Parly form of enquiry – defer decn. until we see more.
D.S. Parly. enquiry is out because issue of controversy betwn. Parties.
H. Sensible report by P.C.’s (if you cd. get it) wd. help to reduce controversy.
P.M. Will discuss this p.m. in smaller group of Ministers.
Doubtful re Parly. enquiry in last year of Parlt.
Wait until sitn. is in hand, but semi-judicial enquiry as soon as possible thereafter.
I.M. Support x/. Moderate opinion doesn’t believe there was a plot. Also Perth to go &amp; consider possibility of enquiry – &amp; lead opinion in sense of a one-man enquiry.
K. Support x/ strongly.
P.M. i) Wd. like to publish W. Paper limited to proving tht. Govr. &amp; ALB
acted rightly on basis of intelligence available.
ii) Enquiry going rather wider, incldg. origins of trouble.
iii) Wait then for a R. Commn. to prepare for 1960.
3. Civil Service Salaries.
R.A.B. Reported conclns. reached by Cab. y’day.
4. India : Financial Aid.
H.A. Discussions last year – ending in agreemt. (Int. Bank) to help India up to end March ’59. Our share was £38 M. Agreed to hold further mtg. to consider help for 59/60, and we commd. ourselves to giving some help. Suggest we put betwn. £15-25 M. into a joint scheme for this coming year: hope we may not have to go to maximum. Her needs may prove less than forecast. We must keep something in hand for contn. to Indus waters scheme, on wh. Bank may put up a plan in March.
Agreed. [Exit M., Ch.H., J.M.,
Hail., J.H.
5. Germany.
a) Procedure.
P.M. Sought Cab. endorsement of F.O. tel. to W’ton. 1378 re procedure. U.S. draft was not sufficient or satisfactory.
First task : get Allies to agree on character &amp; date of mtgs. That will help to get them to concentrate on substance.
Expect tough answers for U.S. But don’t propose to yield on this until after I have seen President.
French are not averse to this line. Cd. be brought to conform.
Germans more likely to be interested in substance than procedure.
S.Ll. Fr. &amp; G. now take line tht. if F. Ministers fail, all the more reason for a Summit mtg. That is advance – U.S. view = opposite.
Participation &amp; agenda : may be diffies., but Fr. won’t be awkward.
b) Visit to Paris.
Atmosph. friendly. Think Fr. &amp; G. realise you can’t have a war over this.
But if there is a Munich they will cast me as N. Chamberlain!
When I pressed de G. to say what mil. contn. he wd. make – none. He is indulging in brinkmanship at our expense.
On substance : Fr. are sensible on G. They agree tht. you can’t re-unify G. save by war : must face these facts : but must, for sake of Germans, keep some light at end of tunnel. We shd. have constructive plan, too – prs. on confedn. basis : to keep the G. soul alive. Re-unificn. by free elections is not on : but we can’t say so flatly.
Short-term problem. Fr. wd. prefer to stand on existg. rights – arrangemt. with D.D.R. w’in existg. agreements. Accommn. of detail w’in that.
We have bn. thinking on other lines. Can’t stand for ever on rights of conquest : cdn’t then make a peace treaty at all. Therefore, negotiate a new agreement, with suitable guarantees.
Much to be said for either approach. Fr. think first is safer.
S.Ll. Fr. agree tht. our agreemts. with W. Germany is de facto peace treaty. And recognise too tht. our juridical posn. in W. Berlin is not v. strong.
A.L.B. People won’t understand a war to unite Germany.
D.S. Progress. No ultimatum. Negotn. K.’s flexibility on guarantees. Hope U.S. can be brght along. Wd. prefer troops &amp; U.N. in W. Berlin.
P.M. This can’t be solved in U.N. But valuable to bring U.N. in as part of settlement – to help in guaranteeing it.
D.S. Don’t like stages in memo. Impn. of weakness. Wd. sooner not appear to be driven back.
Not happy about disengagement. Our plan is so unfavourable to R. tht. we shd. be pressed to go further twds complete disengagemt. wh. wd. disrupt N.A.T.O.
H.A. Divided G. is on our interest. Seek modus vivendi on basis of status quo.
H. Support P.M.’s approach. Tough time ahead, in W’ton. U.N. presence as guarantor – v. useful. Timing : what will F. Ministers do, with Gromyko. Shd. we not narrow gap betwn. that &amp; Summit mtg.
S.Ll. That is ground for fixing date for Summit. It moves For. Ministers along.
P.M. They cd. do prepns. – if agenda cd. be widened.
R.A.B. Statement by P.M. on Wed. before Easter will avert debate. Need for conference on keeping public opinion informed. Need to review state of C. Defence. May have to say somethg : but not w’out refce. to P.M. Concentrate on evacuation policy &amp; communications.</content>
