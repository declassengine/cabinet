  <content>C.C. 20(60). 24th March, 1960.
1. Parliament. [Enter M.R.
R.A.B. Business of next week in H/C.
S. Africa : I will not offer a day of ours, certainly not next week.
P.M. But express sympathy – for another week.
K. Is it in order at all?
After discn. amendment agreed.
2. National Health Service. [Enter D.W-S.
Remuneration.
H.A. As in memo. Retrospection, tho’ v. large sum, is justified by the t. of r. of the Commission.
Ministers shd. consider further the ques of allowances for resident doctors.
P.M. Reviewing bodies. Won’t it lead to spiralling? Wd. it not be better to get all these into one?
D.W-S. Cd. have common secretariat &amp; prs. a single Chairman.
H.A. I am concerned at this. Will discuss it further with Ministers. But safer, on this occn., to swallow Rpt. as a whole.
R.A.B. G.p.’s won’t like this : they want more tax-free allowances.
H.A. I shd. be alarmed if they were satisfied.
Reduction in size of lists.
D.W-S. Various alternative ways of spending this larger sum of remuneration. On the whole prefer shorter lists as making more appeal to public. (Rather than points for special qualificns. or larger allowes. for maternity services.)
P.M. Only 1900 doctors wd. be affected.
D.W-S. But that means 6 m. patients. And sound on medical grounds.
H.A. Wd. like to go into this further with M/H. (Fin. Secy.)
[Exit D.W-S.
3. Aircraft Industry.
D.S. As in memo.
P.M. Cited precedents.
H. Apart fr. Menon, others in Indian Govt. are keen to buy aircraft from elsewhere.
H.A. Subsidy to industry, say £20 M p.a. : warned M/A. that we must get back what we can.
Prev. concessions were made to help firm to get order or avoid loss.
No consultn. with Ty. before A. Toms promised favourable considn.
D.S. My purpose is not to help purchaser, but to pave way for further sales by B. manufacturer.
S.Ll. Good business to abate this.
R.M. No : won’t add to our net sales to India. And criticism of pouring money into aircraft industry.
H.A. Will consider wtr I can get round the point of principle.
4. Railways.
P.M. Stedeford has agreed to preside over planning committee. Have made it clear we don’t want a report &amp; do want recommns. for early interim action – in capacity of adviser to M/T.
M/T. shd. soon be able to make an announcement – including other members.
T. of r. shd. be v. general.
5. Geneva Conference : Nuclear Tests.
P.M. Diff. situation. If U.S. took a wrong line publicly, v. diff. if we had to take opposite view. On the other hand, pressure from us might stiffen Pentagon opposition. But I think it right to accept what is in effect an invitn. from him for me to come to W’ton. for discussion.
There is much for us both to discuss – timing of Treaty : no. of inspns. – can that wait until Summit.
Vital importance of stopping others from entering nuclear field.
Announce mid-night Friday, if U.S. agree.
6. Economic Co-operation.
H.A. Name for a new O.E.E.C. U.S. suggn. – Orgn. for Econ. Co-opn. [&amp; Developmt.]. We think mistaken to include [ ]. If they want to omit Europe, we could accept that.
P.M. Doubtful. What about Australian re-action.
Agreed : oppose this name – offer no alternative.</content>
