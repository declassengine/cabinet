  <content>C.C. 32(59). 28th May, 1959.
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H., O.G.
R.A.B. Business for week opening 8th. June. Need to complete N.I. Bill (pensions) and Finance Bill in that week, before moving on to Educn. etc., and N. Assistce. Bill.
2. Foreign Affairs.
a) Russian Defector.
O.G. Mme. D. defected from the Soviet dacha : and applied for asylum. We weren’t sure she was seeking it on political grounds. She was persuaded to see Soviet officials. Because clear tht. her troubles were really matrimonial, husband threatening divorce. But she has said she won’t return to Soviet Union. We can’t force her to do so. She won’t go to Embassy. She has no means of livelihood. If we treat her as defector, we can give her money from public funds.
Hail. Is it justifiable to sustain her on Secret funds?
G.Ll. If you give her no help, you leave her no option but to take money from Press.
O.G. Even if we treat her as defector, we can say she was influenced largely by personal considerations.
P.M. We can’t enforce her return to R. F.O./H.O. to work out a statement.
b) Germany.
R.A.B. Pol. diffy. here because few of our people care much for re-unification of Germany. Feeling may develop strongly v. re-unification.
P.M. In fact, no-one wants status quo to be changed – at least for years to come. Even Adenaner was content to leave over re-unification.
Tactics for us – don’t show our hand too clearly before Summit. Try to get enough “progress” (mainly by analysis) to bring U.S. to a Summit.
O.G. U.S. have now rumbled what G. and Fr. are doing. And Herter is looking for “progress”.
H.W. Support RAB.’s political point. Our people don’t want to see G. united.
3. Education: Voluntary Schools.
P.M. We are agreed on policy. Problem is only one of timing – shd. we legislate this session &amp; get it over, or shd. we merely announce intention to do it in next session of Parlt.
G.Ll. Favour legn. Decln. wd. increase controversy, and keep it alive.
H.W. After legn., disgruntled vote by Free Church people.
I.M. Favour statement. It wd. commit Oppn. more squarely than legn. which they haven’t opposed.
Ch.H. Favour legn. Less likely to remain a live issue.
H.A. On balance, favour legn.
D.E. Favour legn.
H.B. So do I : will kill it as election issue.
Hail. Favour legn.
M. So do I.
J.H. So do I – increasingly convinced.
I.M. No direct Sc. interest. But I wd. favour legn.
Ch.W. Party will be relieved by nature of Bill, when they see it. They wd. sooner get legn. over, on balance.
R.A.B. Previously favoured delay because no general acquiescence by Churches. Free Churches are on warpath. After reflection – Opposn. will support declaration, but will plainly make capital during election. They will take more advantage of us than if we pass the legn. R.C.’s have made it clear to me tht. they will magnify significance of our not havg. legislated – and will break away from agreement and will ask for more. There will then be trouble in R.C. constituencies. Poole and Central Office favour legn. : because they think R.C. trouble is more dangerous than Free Church opposition.
Conclude therefore that legn. will give us less trouble. If we so decide, we ought to try to get Free Churches in better order. Defer introdn. of Bill for 10 days for that purpose.
P.M. Views of Cantuar. In effect, don’t disturb the agreement. On the politics, my concern is about the Liberals – who might try to revive their Party appeal on this issue, if it were a live one. Which course wd. be least damaging from that angle? On balance seems preferable to have had the legn. passed.
P.M. General view is in favour of legn.
*Special secrecy. P.M. to settle, with L.P.S. and E.H., timing of any announcement.
C.A.
[Exit G.Ll.
4. Klaus Fuchs.
R.A.B. F.O. have amendment on 3rd. sentence. “It will not therefore be for HMG. to determine, on his discharge, where he shd. live.”
O.G. Some U.S. resentment may be voiced – tho’ Adminn., on warning from Caccia, have taken it quietly.
Agreed : subject to this amendment.
5. Coal.
P.M. V. interesting picture.
i) reductn. in demand is not due to industrial recession – cf. para. 7. Total demand has bn. m’tained.
ii) increased use of oil : para. 9.
iii) precarious posn. over oil (para. 10) : for we get all our oil for nil and bonus to b/payments as well.
H.A. Tho’ income is return for v. large capital investment.
P.M. Future action. In terms of efficiency, we shd. not check use of oil. In terms of politics, there wd. still be a v. large coal industry. But, in view of risk of losing our oil, we must keep a healthy coal industry.
Clear : we shd. run down open-cast p’mme and hold it as reserve.
M. Have warned E.P.C. &amp; Cab. of movement v. coal. I raise it again because proposals by N.C.B., wh. are not acceptable. This year we shall have to make a policy statement. Transfer to oil is world phenomenon. Doubt if can keep industry at output of more than 200 m. tons p.a. This wd. involve i) running down open-cast, over period up to ’62 [no new sites] ii) p’mme of closing pits.
H.A. | Some sites where contracts let but work not started. Cd. we look at cost of
x| cancelling those contracts.
M. Will consider that. Enough to have decision in principle to bring open-cast p’mme to an end as soon as practicable. Agreed
Proposal to reduce price in S/England. Object : to halt transfer to oil. This wd. cost £3 M. –&amp; he proposed to offset that by increased price in Scotland. I wd. prefer a wider range of price changes – both by quality and district. .
P’mme for closing pits – to maximum extent on basis tht. they are worked out.
Further report from N.C.B. by end/June. Some announcement may have to be made in Sept., but wd. not be necessary to have actual price increases operating by then.
H.A. Hesitate before we take doctrinal position on future policy. Must keep room for manoeuvre.
Coal is our main raw material : oil supply is uncertain : don’t exclude all
y| possibility of giving some preference to coal. E.g. I wdn’t exclude addl. duty
| on oil, to enable coal to compete. Freedom of choice of fuel doesn’t exclude
| duty on oil.
Prices. We have no legal right to limit discretion of N.C.B. We must bear in mind eventual potential burden on Exchequer. Power-stations : shd. use maximum of small coal and there shd. be a propn. of dual user.
(M. We are turning back to coal : all new power stations are coal-fired).
H.A. Open-cast. I endorse policy subject to x/.
M. I don’t agree with y/. Wrong conception.
P.M. Avoid dogma either way. Let us remain pragmatical.
M. Shall have to say we don’t intend to act on N.U.M. for tax on oil. [Enter K.
P.M. May be : but take stand on practical grounds, not on dogma.
D.E. It is cheaper to use coal than oil. (Sterling balances.) Also, Soviet cd. cut severely into profits of our oil companies.
N.C.B. has not freedom of price policy because over the years must pay its way. This prevents them from selling at a loss in order to stimulate use.
Hail. What about oil from coal? Turned down some years ago on a background v. difft. from to-day’s.
M. This is a live issue now.
P.M. Immediate tactics : play this long : develop plans for announcement later in the year.
Next discussion to be processed thro’ E.P.C.
M’while reject N.C.B. proposals on price &amp; on restrictg. import of oil.</content>
