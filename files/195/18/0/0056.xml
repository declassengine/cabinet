  <content>C.C. 14 (60).
1st March, 1960
1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter M.R.
S.Ll. a) Germany. They are ready to move in step (accord) with N.A.T.O. – more than consultn. but less than consent.
2. Post Office. [Enter R.W., P.M.G.
PMG. Appd. in principle last July – mentioned in manifesto – outstanding issues between Dpts have bn. resolved – HAC. approve.
Ty. control wd. be preserved over pay &amp; condns. and over capital expenditure.
G.P.O. is unique in our view. W. Paper doesn’t refer to natd. industries as such.
Changes in rates – para. 26 (f). As we withdraw Estimates control, we think it right to offer negative resoln. on rates.
Want to present this on 23/3 &amp; make legn. early next Session.
Believe it will be welcomed by both sides of H/C.
H.A. Support this. Not a major change. Shd. we not be sure of date of introdn. of Bill before presenting W. Paper. Awkward if we had publd. W. Paper &amp; then had to defer legn.
R.A.B. Want this Bill in early October. Therefore favour presentn. in April in order to give time to get legn. prepared.
i) We shall now be altering rlway legn. earlier than we had contemplated.
ii) Shall we have time to do this &amp; rlways. I think we shall.
iii) Parly. control – p.7. – will involve discussion. “Effective” vice “ample” Parly. control. (heading of para. 25)
I.M. Para 3 and 12 : are they consistent. Control over pay is a big hole in his independence.
P.M. Agree. Also dislike para 5. Both 3 &amp; 5 are over-statements.
Para. 20. Is there a sound commercial organn. in the public sector?
Para. 33. “a status more appropriate.”
H.B. Para. 12 omit “therefore”.
Agreed : present just before Easter recess.
[Exit R.W., PMG.
3. Federation of Rhodesia.
H. Thanks to Cab. and I.M. for latitude in negotn. Compromise achieved. – 5 days before M. leaves &amp; while I.M. in Fedn. 3 wks’ longer detn. is awkward. But i) evidence of other Africans. ii) security (on this plan Fedn. will supply re-inforcemts) iii) chance for B. to see M. before he leaves.
Was condn. of their agreement tht. plan to release B. wd. not
Conclns. i) opinion in S.Rh. be disclosed in advance.
is v. excited – secession in air.
ii) pol. advance in north will have bn accompanied by some
move in the south.
iii) another disorder in N. wd. brk. Fedn.
iv) must keep closer consultn. with W., as P.M. of Federation.
I.M. V.grateful – splendid achievement.
Logic in settlement. M.’s visit to N. 3 parts : in 1st. phase other Africans shd. give evce. : then he goes to north : then B. can be seen in last phase.
Will try to keep plan secret. But v. difficult : For 5/3 is anniversary of emergency : periodical review begins. Hope to help by announcing to-morrow (2/3) my visit to Fedn. on 23/3. It will be expected tht. B. will be released – esp. on 3 dates in March. Armitage will wish to say B. won’t
But these are all presentational difficulties : on which I shall continue to keep in touch with H. be released. If so, will be assumed to be another 6 months. H. or I must find a form of words wh. will satisfy W. Bound to be build-up of expectn. when M. arrives in N. – &amp; possible resignations by Chirwa &amp; others. I rate security risk of that higher than locals do. Also M. may have to tip Chirwa off privately.
P.M. Our own plan involved less risk.
Lesson of all this : we can’t manage these affairs w’out keeping Fedn. Govt. with us all through. Need for further consultation.
4. Farm Price Review.
J.H. Costs have risen by £2 M. Farmers have asked for + £20 M. as against our suggestion of £15 M. We cd. prob. get agreement on £4 or 5 M. Don’t however recommend trying for that.
Two differences i) on efficiency : I wd. prefer to dis-allow less than Ty. suggest. I wd. like to give them £3 M. vice
ii) assistce. to pigs. Ty. favour 6d. a score. I wanted 111/2d. Because of Danes etc., I came down to 9d. £2 M.
Don’t believe this wd. cause Danes to rat on their agreement. Their exports to U.K. are rising : for our pig populn. has bn falling : it is beginning to recover &amp; we don’t want to check that. We shan’t if we seem to be knuckling under to the Danes.
Feeling among farmers has turned v. Govt. since election. Must have some ammunition with which to fight back v. campaign by new Chairman of N.F.U.
J.M. Support on pigs : sitn. is same in Scotland.
H.A. Know that pigs are sensitive with farmers. But if our farmers can’t make pigs pay at present prices, we shd. allow popn. to fall – to keep in line with costs in other Eur. countries.
Ready to drop to £-10 M. Don’t want to concede another £1 M. on pigs.
Over next year gt. risks of over prodn. of many commodities.
My view £10 M. and not more than 6d. on pigs.
After further discussion : agreed 9d on pigs and £3 M. on efficiency but 1½d. off eggs and adjust cereals prices.</content>
