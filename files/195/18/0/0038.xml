  <content>C.C. 49 (59).
29th July, 1959: 6.30.pm
Germany.
P.M. On 13/7 Herter told S.Ll. in gt. confidence tht. E. had concluded Summit was inevitable : war cdn’t be allowed to start w’out this attempt at settlement. Contemplated Summit Quebec Sept. 1. Sept., preceded by i) mtg. of W. Govts about 20/8 and ii) short visit by K. to U.S.A.
My message of 21st. June to E.
On 29/6 received further message from E.
Then Herter’s disclosure to S.Ll. of E.’s invitn. to K. to visit U.S. By muddle this had not bn. linked to Summit &amp; was w’out condns. He sought our advice. I gave it – in my message to E., which was shown to ??? before despatch. Read this to Cabinet. No answer received. But long discns. in Geneva, which continue.
G.’s posn. has hardened – no doubt because K. has got his free invitn. to U.S.
At Geneva y’day the 2 sides produced their papers. Don’t like them. [Fr. have now bn. told about K.’s visit ; &amp; this will probably leak.] I consider the R. paper more reasonable than ours. Madness to break on this
Tough talk at Geneva cf. Codel 360 para. 16 – read. : our posn. wd. be v. weak.
E.’s plan to travel in Oct/Nov : Japan, India, Pakistan, Moscow [and London].
I still prefer Alternative A. But it’s clear U.S. won’t agree to it.
Read Codel 364.
Alternatives. i) We cd. demand early Summit, but it wd. involve threatening to say so publicly.
There are, however, objns. Risk of later start &amp; dragging on. Don’t want Election late in year. Risk of a bad Summit. That wd. give us, not Election, but crisis.
ii) Allow U.S. to have later Summit – if we can present intervening stages as further progress twds settlement. But part of that picture wd. need to be firm decision to have a Summit.
Read tel. to S.Ll. of to-day.
R.A.B. i) P.M. had done all he cd.
ii) Posn. is serious, both internationally &amp; for presentn. to public.
P.M. foresaw, months since, tht. our Allies wd. be inflexible and liable to take indefensible position.
How soon will news break?
P.M. W’ton has leaked W. Summit. No harm in that. Can’t tell when rest may come out.
Must persuade Allies to say there will be a Summit. May not be possible to do that before W. Summit.
H.W. Politically, there is advantage in later Summit.
D.E. Political risk here of its appearing that U.S. and R. are settling behind our back.
R.A.B. Stress W. Summit : this is our best hope for opinion here.
P.M. Cab. alarmed at consequences, wh. E. can’t have foreseen, if appears U.S. about to do deal with R. (Moscow different). This can be avoided if a) Geneva ends on basis if reportg. to Govts b) W. Summit early : not later end/Aug. c) K.’s visit presented as part of contacts. [Posn. only tenable if decn. to have Summit before end of year is made a latest at W. Summit.]
Cab. feel that b) is specially important.
On a) end on hopeful note.</content>
