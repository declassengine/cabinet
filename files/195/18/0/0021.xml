  <content>C.C. 29 (59). 6th May, 1959 Aircraft Industry : Replacement for Dakota. [Enter A.J., G.W.
P.M. Is there a case for making this exception from our general policy – because of its larger export potential?
H.A. On balance, yes. But shd. not be a precedent.
P.M. Will it get the market? Is market as large as supposed?
A.J. Change in my thought is due to diffies. of method of support. Method
Suggn. : I shd. buy, lend to B.E.A., compensate them for operating loss. This wd. be novel. My legal powers wd. probably cover it. But shd. have to include in Estimates &amp; explain to H/C. . Fake a home order to spark of exports.
(i) If I begin to subsidise home operators, I shall reduce their readiness to place firm orders. This is happening on Rotadyne. Dis-service to long-run interests of industry.
(ii) Objective : give confidence to f. buyers. Will a fake order give it? Doubt if it will bring f. orders.
M.’s alternative : I shd. lend to H.P. to enable them to give aircraft cheaper to B.E.A. But this, equally, cdn’t be concealed.
Only other alternative : Transpt. Command to order 3. Straightfwd., but wd. it give confidence to f. civil customers.
M. £1M. over 10 yrs. W. party report on powers. Concln. : not a novel exercise of powers to demonstrate quality of aircraft &amp; attract f. sales. No real diffy. in method.
H.W. B.E.A. don’t want this type. But they wd
Wd. not appear as gift to B.E.A. . order 3. Bargain wd. involve (i) contn. by H.P. ii) B.E.A. contn. because they wd. get 3 more modern aircraft iii) M/Supply contn. of £3/4-1 M. over 10 years.
D.S. Will they sell abroad? Firm can’t carry risk tht. they won’t. Are Govt. prepared to carry it?
Nothing in the “cachet” argument unless Govt. order is genuine. A mere 3 aircraft won’t do it.
P.M. Ques for Cabinet is wtr we do want to support these 2 types?
A.J. We turned down H.P. project in ’54 : we ought not to cough up now, after he went on on his own. This wd. be propping up weak members of industry.
I.M. Wdn’t. discourage others from risking own capital : for it wd. be because H.P. had taken a risk tht he got Govt. help in the end.
P.M. Situation has changed because of that &amp; because industry is not over-loaded. A Govt. investment, as speculn., wd. not be out of place now.
M Avro project is much the same but 2 years behind.
H.A. Is it feasible to support whichever firm gets the Indian order.
A.J. To support both wd. make nonsense of a rationalisn. policy.
D.E. I agree with that
* But I subscribe to doctrine of home order as pre-requisite for exports. .
It wd. have effect – cf. N. Zealand.
D.S. I doubt wtr there is much prospect for export sales. They need 60 or so to break even.
A.L.B. I support *. I wd. go ahead with this.
A.J. Both firms are trying to sell to India. Objective test wd. be to back which India chooses. 2 years’ ahead argument : timing of Hawker may be better, for airlines aren’t buying at present.
P.M. We are ready to make exception to general policy.
The aircraft wh. is ready is made by the weaker firm.
H.A. How long before a decision likely in India?
A.J. About a month. I cd. ask Indian M/Def. how his opinion is moving.
P.M. Cabinet are unwilling to lose all chance in this market.
Cd. we say : we will support H.P. &amp; thereby get N.Z. order : we will inform India tht if they are hesitatg. to buy either because doubt wtr U.K. have faith in them we will support whichever they choose.
Having decided that in principle, Ty. with M/S. and M/T. can work out best means of providing support.
A.J. Will go along, subject to –
i) no announcement until we have told India.
ii) no communn. to BEA until we have worked out method in consultn. with Ty.
P.M. iii) no word to either firm.</content>
