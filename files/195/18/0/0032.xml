  <content>C.C. 41 (59)
14th July, 1959
1. Procedure. [Enter E.H., Profumo
P.M. Called attention to rules re speeches on f. affairs.
2.
Germany : Manufacture of Guided Missiles.
J.D.P. Put a new proposal for amendment of W.E.U. Treaty.
P.M. Don’t insist on Nov. date. For leaks are likely.
3. Germany. Geneva Meeting.
P.M. U.S. reply to our approach : gave me full satisfn. tht. U.S. will work in direction favoured by us. But important tht. they shd. take the initiative. Our pre-arranged posn. shd. therefore be kept most secret.
4.
Industrial Dispute: Printing.
I.M. Now in 4th. week. 4 out of 10 Unions concerned are feeling financial pinch : and most of men want to get back because holidays. The remit to Chairman was therefore satisf. – based on employers’ draft. Enquiry may, however, be protracted : at least 2 wks. and prs 4-6 ; for Willis will fight on.
D.E. Quota on imports of printed material. Employers want it enlarged. Have taken view tht. Govt. shd. not take this “strike-breaking” action.
I.M. That view shd. be m’tained.
5.
Agriculture : Marginal Production Grants.
J.M. Addn. of J.H.’s formula will provoke immediate row – whereas in ’62 we may be able to find a plan which avoids a row.
J.H. W’out this Formula it will be assumed tht. M.A.P. will continue in Scotland. This will create pressure for re-opening it elsewhere in U.K. Don’t get into trouble in 3 parts of U.K. to avoid it in 4th.
J.M. The 3 parts will gain over next years : but Scotland will not. Can be demonstrated to them tht. they will get more out of small farmers’ scheme than Scotland will.
M.A.P. may prove to be best method for Scotland.
J.H. Problem in Scotland is confined to 2.000 farmers.
H.A. What about “the existing m.p. schemes”?
R.A.B. N.I. are now kicking hard v. further concessions to Scotland. What they now ask will have repercussions in E. &amp; W.
And this will arise on either formula.
J.H. I cd. resist that, if my formula were added.
H.A. M/Agric. has gone as far as he dares : w’out his formula the new Act will be broken up hopelessly.
P.M. 1) Find a formula for incldg. J.H.’s reference in the preamble – repns. in view of the decision tht. MAP as such shall not be continued.
2) Consider merits – on basis of factual statement of posn. in N. Ireland etc.,
I.M. Why make the statement in Parlt. Easier to announce to Press (publication of a lr.) early in recess. Agreed : as above (this page).
6.
Government Expenditure.
H.A. Forecasts, as they are refined, continue to rise – cf. para. 10.
Supply : increase 6.2%. Defence : increase …….
[Try again : it’s really para. 9. And to that, add Pilkington etc., I calculated total increase at £350 M., on present forecasts.
Suggest tht. all Ministers shd. review his estimates. We must decline new expenditure &amp; try to reduce costs of existg. services. Lessons for a Manifesto!
H.B. Approachg. stage for heavy capital expenditure – on hospitals &amp; roads – both of wh. are carried above the line. We cdn’t carry p’mmes on housing or educn. if cost had had to be carried above line.
H.A. In part that is explann. But also heavy item for General Grant.
R.M. But Death Duties are above line, too!
What about public investment?
H.A. Will rise by £30-35 M.
And private will bump up if Tories win Election. That will be an awkward sitn.
D.E. Bound to be a boom if we win – followed by deflationary Budget. ……
7.
Egypt. Financial Agreement.
No note taken.
Agreed : Must be some interim payments.
Loans shd. be deducted from these – &amp; reserved for final
settlement.
Proceed on basis tht. there will eventually be a graduated
scheme.
F.O. and Ty. to settle on this basis, with L.P. in consultn.
F.O. to assume responsibility for Loans.
8.
British Transport Commission.
H.W. Re-assessment of development plan – will have to be published ; and, if so, sooner rather than later. I wd. hold joint Press Conference with B.T.C.
Propose to publish after N.U.R. Conference circa 22/7. Agreed
production. : subject to deletion of words in para. 70 giving estimate of coal
9.
Irish Republic.
D.E. Ireland conclude they can’t join Six or Seven. Turning therefore to thought tht. their economy shd. be integrated even more closely with U.K. They have £50 M. of imports fr. foreign countries.
They wd. be ready to consider bi-lateral deal with N.I. on goods coming s. across the border.
H.A. V. odd ideas are being floated.
10.
Licensing Laws in Scotland.
P.M. Necessary?
J.M. Gt. pressure for it. Takes it out of politics for a time.
R.A.B. Good case on merits. Tho’ awkward because we aren’t going to look at in in E&amp; W.</content>
