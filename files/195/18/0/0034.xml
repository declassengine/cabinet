20th July, 1959
1. Nysaland : Emergency. [Enter Profumo, E.H.
P.M. Normally one wd. have delayed publn. for about a month, in order to get &amp; consider views of local Govr. As session is about to end, we must hasten publn., even tho’ it means rushing Govr. – more awkward if it all came out in Recess.
Govr.’s despatch shd. go to Press to-night.
Two courses open to Govr. i) condemn Govr. &amp; call for his resignation. This wd. involve resignation of ALB. &amp; other C.O. Ministers. Tho’ ALB has made it clear tht. his personal posn. shd. not obstruct national interest. His resignation is at my disposal. We must bear in mind effect on other Col. Govts. and C. Servants.
ii) Devlin vindicates Govr’s decn. to declare emergency – plan involving assignation – ample ground for apprehending violence. Criticism mainly on action taken thereafter – its roughness etc.,
No middle course. If we believe tht. it is in national interest tht. this shd. be treated in a balanced way, then we shd. support Govr.’s action – tho’ ready to see what lessons can be learned.
K. Effect on Africa. Rpt. makes it clear. Necessary to declare emergency : Govr’s decn. not influenced by Welensky : disturbances in N., road blocks etc., had already occurred, and policy of violence adopted (with readiness to kill). Kenya example : action too late &amp; too slow. Congo. Govr. had no alternative but to declare emergency. Execution : I have considered all incidents : hope B. people haven’t reached condn. when they condemn a man for firing when 4 military face crowds of several hundred.
Govr.’s comments – based almost wholly on facts found by Devlin.
Att.G. (In reply to P.M.) Surprised by D.’s report. Support K.’s attitude. Distinction between killing and cold-blooded assassination – can’t be sustained. Content with Govr.’s answer. On legal grounds we have nil to fear.
Hail. There is difference between “plan” as put fwd. in W. Paper and what D. found – violence, incldg. murder. But it is not material. Second justified decln. of emergency. We can support action taken – tho’ presentn. mght have bn. different. Matter of emphasis.
H.W. Support C.O.
I.M. We did prs. stress overmuch possibility of a planned campaign of assassinn.
* Suggest x/ on p. 77 shd. be included in Govr.’s comments.
D.S. Real ques : what wd. have bn. thght of Govr. if he had not acted and murders had occurred.
A.L.B. shd. come out v. well from this debate.
D.E. Support K. and Hail. Support Govr.
Why did D. take this line? People must have thght the murder plot was cooked up from outset. Difference of opinion on Dr. Banda (betwn Govr. and
D. Commrs.) – cf. Govr.’s belief that he wdn’t compromise. This will be important point in debate.
M. Establd. tht. Congress advocated violence : tht. Govr. was right in declaring emergency : tht. it was right to act firmly. Rest is detail.
G.Ll. Politics of debate. Gruesome reading for average man. Don’t take too much of a true-Blue line in public. Illustrates diffies. of transition from paternal rule to democracy. Where all turns on respect for authority, hard to concede all the ‘democratic’ rights. Shd. we stress these difficulties – at least, show awareness of the problem.
J.H. Africa’s debt to A.L.B.
How many (African) lives were saved
How far has Govr. pressed on with constitutional talks? May be criticism on this point. by firm action.
H. Acceptance of this report w’out reply wd. undermine posn. of all Govts. in Africa.
Be ready to quote criticisms of Kenya Govt. for failure to act.
Diffce. betwn plot and plan is hair-splitting.
Dr Banda : can’t have bn. unaware.
Conduct of operations – more uneasy. Rhodesian parallel is awkward. We mght concede enquiry into Police organisation – too few, too young.
R.A.B. Must see it thru’ : on merits.
D.’s impression was tht. Govr. took sitn. too seriously. He has failed to realise effect of his own report – too dramatic.
Ch.H. D.’s report alone justified decln. of emergency. Our embarrassment will be on minor points – inaccuracies in W. Paper ; Govr’s failure to mention plot in his b’cast : burning of a house.
H.B. Difference betwn. completed plan for assassinations &amp; dangerous readiness to contemplate violence. There is
Length of Govr’s comments (&amp; detail) may reduce its impact. a difference, but second alone warrants actions taken.
Discussions may concentrate on p1. – police state. Hope these condns. won’t continue.
Att.G. Para 168. They didn’t conclude there was even a design to kill. This is diff. from analysis of Hail &amp; H.B. It is this para. to which the Govr. rightly replies.
P.M. Revise Govr’s despatch, in light of this discussion.
Shorten passages re
This is urgent. More time to consider our line in debate. We shd. include refce. to problems wh. lie behind it. Need for firm action at outset : to save suffering in long run. cf. Kenya &amp; prs. even Indian Mutiny. W. Paper and murder plot.
Why were Devlin Commrs. so naive? Try to judge that, in readiness for debate.
Bring out G.Ll.’s point : don’t be afraid of this.
H. Also clear tht. it was not oppn. to Fedn. tht. Congress was after. That was pretext.
2.
Kenya. Hola Detention Camp.
P.M. Exchange of despatches : &amp; findings of disciplinary board. Changes in organisation and personnel.
Organisation. Responsibility blurred betwn 2 Dpts. There will now be clear chain of command for i) detention camps &amp; re-habilitation and ii) prisons.
Personnel. Summarised changes. Campbell remains. But disciple. board has found tht. he was misled by Sullivan.
A.L.B. Campbell was one of 3 : and the most junior : he wrote the note. Unfair to penalise him alone. Nor wd. action v. all 3 be just : not a commn. of enquiry: merely to collect situation report. Campbell said [“opinion of all we met” was violence had not bn. used.]
Thompson thght it had, but wasn’t asked his view.
Fairn thinks Campbell one of the best men in Prison Service.
Att.G. A.L.B. has told me this. But magistrate treated Campbell as leader of the 3 and spks. of “Campbell commn.” ; and attached importance to it and esp. to []. Misleadg. report led to Govr.’s first statement tht. deaths due to drinking water.
Can’t be said tht. Sullivan misled Campbell on this particular fact – [presumably []].
Shd. nil be done re these 3, despite serious strictures. Dangerous to decline enquiry.
A.L.B. Read tel. from Govr.
P.M. Formal enquiries had already bn. set on foot by C.I.D. This
Possibly in reply by ALB. to Govr. – say the 3 were a little careless. was a recce on behalf of Govr. Mistake was to treat it as formal report : but that was mistake of Govr. Surely enough if Govr. formally recorded tht. the three had carried out their enquiry pretty carelessly.
I.M. Better in a debate.
P.M. In debate some words shd. be used to show tht. we think it was pretty inefficient on part of these three. Cab. to consider formula on Thursday.
Despatches to be publd. as they stand.</content>
