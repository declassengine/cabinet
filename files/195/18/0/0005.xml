  <content>C.C.6(59). 10th February, 1959.
1. Egypt. Financial Agreement. [Enter Redmayne.
S.Ll. No progress likely unless we resume neogtns. in Cairo.
H.A. Agree.
P.M. Yes : a Minister will have to go.
2. Parliament.
R. Business for this week.
P.M. May be asked for F.A. debate before I leave. Labour may, however, wish to avoid it. If asked, we can’t decline Supply day.
[Enter B.C.
3. Pensions.
H.A. Not sure it wd. be possible to pass legn. before end/July on pensions increase. Want to consult R.A.B. before we take decision.
R. Will be v. diff.
P.M. Look up history of last Bill. Oppn. wdn’t make diffies. just before an Election.
Agreed : resume discussion on Thursday Cabinet.
[Exit B.C.
4. Horticulture.
P.M. 1) Cut Flowers – yes or no – and rate.
2) What other assistance to horticulture – in addition to 7 M. plan.
On 1) summarised Trend’s brief. But increase won’t affect c/living : won’t greatly increase price : wd. tend to upset Dutch : but wd. show tht. we do sometimes use tariff weapon.
H.A. V. weak economic case. But last of above arguments is strong politically. If it must be met, this is least damaging case. Will hit Dutch. But 33⅓% increase for pol. reasons wd. be tolerable.
J.H. 50% wd. be better politically.
H.A. V. large : also hard to argue tht. we ought to meet their whole case, when there is no real economic case.
J.H. Offset to Dutch : increase quota for bulbs. Increase of £250.000.
P.M. Bad precedent to raise tariff w’out economic cause.
D.E. Awkward argument in G.A.T.T. Also 30 days’ notice. Cdn’t lay an order before 19th. (Thursday). Also under separate oblign. to consult French.
K. If we reject all, they will have no confidence in our policy – and that wd. be damaging economically.
H. How hold the case on tomatoes if we do this?
J.H. Won’t arise before autumn.
P.M. R.A.B. view : do the flowers – and say we are ready to consider means other than tariffs to help horticulture. Growers have lost confidence in Govt : mght therefore be wise to have enquiry conducted by an individual e.g. Fergusson.
J.H. Not opposed to that – but adjust its timing to avoid impression that tariff instrument is discarded. Also need to do some work on it internally first.
I.M. Separate these 2 things in time. Do the cut flowers now. Say nothg about new method until later. To avoid havg. it said we have now dropped tariff altogether.
P.M. General view seems to be tht. we shd. at this stage do no more publicly than announce decision on cut flowers – wh., for pol. reasons, must be a favourable decision.
P.M. Alternatives i) do 33⅓% on flowers &amp; bulbs concession no early
announcemt. of new method
ii) reject flower tariff : admit now tht. tariff won’t give enough
aid &amp; announce enquiry to seek a better method.
Put these out in memo. for decision at Thursday’s Cabinet.
5. Defence : Strategic Air Freighter.
[Enter A.J., G.W.
P.M. Summarised facts. &amp; issues.
D.S. From purely mil. angle. H.P. III is the best. Britannia is militarily acceptable if necessary on econ. grds. I don’t believe we can hope to get a new aircraft in the time suggd. by M/S. The need for them is from 1963 on : we don’t need it earlier. So Britannia is unnecessary now and new aircraft won’t be available until too late.
G.W. Can we afford a new model for a need of only 10? I wd. sooner settle as betwn. H.P. III and Britannia.
A.J. No future for H.P. III. – prob. no future for Handley Page. Cdn’t be represented as consistent with policy of rationalising the industry. We shd. not take that aircraft.
Britannia has some civil possibilities – ready soon – cheap. But admit it hasn’t a long life. Hence my compromise. If that is not acceptable to defence interests, I advocate strongly ordering Britannia. Mainly to keep Shorts in being.
Politically disastrous to drive it into bankruptcy.
I.M. Agree with M/S. In H.P. area unemplt. is only 1.5%. In N.I., it is 10% overall &amp; 7% for males in Belfast.
Compromise isn’t attractive qua emplt. For pressure to build Britannias in B’tol.
H.A. Favour Britannia 3. Disadv. of HP III : no civil use : doesn’t fit a rationalisn. policy : no help to emplt. ques. Plight of Belfast. We must on this occasion give much weight to employmt. considn.
But reserve opinion on another 10 for civil use.
H.W. Interests of civil aviation wd. be best served by the compromise.
It wd. cost more. But there will be a need for a jet freighter in ’60’s.
D.E. Britannia will be out of date before it flies. Prefer compromise : for it wd. give some chance of sales outside our own needs.
M. Britannia 3 – Must go for a plane with some civil potentiality.
R.M. Another order for H. Page would defeat rationalisation.
P.M. Eliminate the H.P. III.
Choice is between compromise plan or Britannia 3.
Apart from emplt. situation, much to be said for compromise. But taking account of that, I wd. favour Britannia 3.
Agreed : Adopt Britannia 3. M/S. and Ty. to settle size of order.
