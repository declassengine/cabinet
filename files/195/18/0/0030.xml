  <content>C.C. 38(59). 30th June, 1959.
1. Berlin. [Enter O.G., E.H.
Tels. to W’ton. 2807, 2808, 2811 and 2881 and from W’ton 1465, 1474, 1485 were available to Cabinet.
P.M. We now await Herter’s reply – likely to arrive here on Thursday. President’s message was encouraging. He accepts my view tht. our posn. is weak : and is not shocked by idea of moratorium. He will, however, be subject to pressures the other way – esp. as Democratic Party are alleging tht. he is weak twds R. U.S. public desire “to be tough”, without knowing how.
If F.M.’s after adjournment cd. make a frame, on basis of moratorium, we cd. identify ques suitable for decision by Summit – duration, level of troops, method of consultn. between Germanies.
S.Ll. Our own posn. is diff. Allies wd. be glad of respite in fact ; but in form they will seize chance of accusing us of weakness. Satisfactory therefore tht. U.S. seems to be willing to take initiative. Better that they should. Worst risk = Mayor of Berlin, for he is in posn. to influence Socialists. Our plan is consistent with his view tht. Berlin shd. not be finally settled save in context of general solution of Germany.
In these circs. we must refuse N.A.T.O. Mtg before Geneva – avoid appearance of panic.
D.S. Presentation. R. have changed their posn. quite a lot in last months.
H.A. Don’t stress that now : wd. make it more difficult for R. to settle.
I.M. R. will take all our offers &amp; assume that as bargaining position. How do we play the hand?
S.Ll. On nos. of troops and duration, reserve it all for Summit. Reserve also procedure for handling complaints re propaganda &amp; subversion.
2. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
8 and 9 July : C. African Federation : F. Affairs – in opposite order, so as to give more time for discn. with Welensky.
P.M. Make one effort to defer African debate – until next week.
R.A.B. Will try – think we shan’t succeed.
[Exit S.Ll.
3. European Economic Community.
O.G. As in memo.
Approved.
4. Civil Defence. Evacuation Policy.
R.A.B. Can we last out until end/Session w’out announcing any policy?
If pressed, I shd. like to make statement as in Annex.
Alternative : say no evacuation, stay put. Alarming to public and impair f. policy.
Wd. try to p’pone statement – and wd. certainly not open discussion with l.a.’s before autumn.
H.B. We have got a policy – the 12 m. plan. It isn’t practicable – but nor is any other.
Convinced no Govt. wd. order evacuation. If they did, remainder wd. evacuate themselves. We must therefore work twds. stay put or at least acceptance of no organised evacuation plan.
If this is so, how do we handle Parlt. No pressure on me. L.a.’s don’t believe in evacuation.
New plan involves saying no evacuation to cities wh. suffered heavy damage in last war.
D.S. Avoid any statement. If Annex B. has to be used, I wd. introduce many more doubts about practicability.
P.M. Avoid any statement, if possible.
If it can’t be avoided, make anodyne answer after consultn. with Ministers concerned.
Certainly no discn. with l.a.’s.
Re-consider policy later in the year.
R.A.B. Wrong not to have a policy.
5. Industrial Disputes : Printing Trade.
I.M. (i) S.O. Willis’ statements are challenge to Govt. Threat to call out S.O. if
Govt. continues to take “provocative” action re
Standing Cttee. of officials now appointed to consider posn., and risks involved in takg. improvised action. pickets etc. No actual dispute w’in S.O. Don’t yet know wtr. W. was in earnest trying to spread strike.
(ii) Printing Ink. Not now being delivered. National newspp. likely to stop on
Friday. Diff. situation may arise in due course. Employers are getting v. tough : threatening to squeeze the firms which have come to terms.
(iii) My own position. Am disposed to act before newspp. go out. Have called
in both sides of ink trade – to ask them to follow as usual printing dispute : but unions declined and I therefore cancelled invitn. This was telephone invitn. I have renewed it in writing. Object : to bring it out that Unions are unwilling to p’pone action or even have declined to talk to me.
Ch.H. Facts of (iii) are now known. We can use that, in publicity.
P.M. Real solution is in structure. Shd. be separate settlements with newspapers and with printers. Former can be blackmailed to pay more. Printers can’t : for their work can go abroad.
6. Education : Teachers’ Salaries.
G.Ll. Period of agreement. Wiser not to ask for undertaking. Better to rely on their offer.
P.M. You mean : accept their offer.
M. Some of us wanted to try for 3 years vice 2½.
I.M. They want Apl. vice Oct. Real choice therefore is between 2½ and 3½.
H.A. Diff. to eat our words. But, apart fr. that, no gain in stability : for in the past assumption has bn. 3 years not 2½. Can we get an assumption (if only by M/Edn.) of 3½.
G.Ll. Cd. only be a unilateral statement by me, in accepting recommn.
D.E. That wdn’t do : we want an offer or undertaking from them.
P.M. Amendment shown in ms. on Annex.
I.M. Deprecate this decision. Shows weakness. But, [unlike H.A.] I do attach some importance to fact that duration is offered by the Cttee. This gives us just enough to avoid a row with teachers.
Agreed : H.A. and G.Ll. to agree terms of reply.
7. Commercial Policy : Butter.
H.A. This is only a spot purchase – once for all – not a contract.
J.H. Denmark can’t give us more.
H.A. Shall have to consider liberalisation for Canadian &amp; U.S. butter.</content>
