  <content>C.C. 33(59). 4th June, 1959.
1. Parliament. [Enter O.G., E.H.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
Debate on Hola incident shd. not be delayed : prob. shd. be on 11/6, in lieu of Finance Bill Committee. Motion is tantamount to vote of censure.
P.M. Monday of followg. week? Giving as reasons, A.L.B.’s absence &amp; need to publish documents.
R.A.B. Announce business as previously planned &amp; adjust later, if need be.
[Enter B.C.
2. National Assistance.
B.C. As in memo.
H.A. No comment.
R.A.B. Statement. Last para. but two. Shd. be carefully studied. On the whole I think it’s as good as we can get.
P.M. Terminology. Changing names doesn’t alter facts. But suppose we must bow to it.
Worried also about “as of right”.
B.C. Suggested an alternative formula for 3rd. sentence.x
P.M. Prefer that. [Exit B.C.
Approved – subject to amendment of statement
x “In our society to-day assistance when in need, according to the provision made by Parlt, is the acknowledged right of the citizen.”
3. Pensions : Higher Judiciary.
K. Terms of proposed statement.
P.M. Not raised on 2nd. Rdg. of Pensions Increase Bill. Cd. statement be made in H/Lds? On 2nd. Rdg. there.
H.A. I wd. prefer that – a casual reference. And Fin. Secy. can make it in Cttee. on Bill if it is raised.
Agreed.
[Enter Perth, Amery, Att.G.
4. Kenya : Hola Detention Camp.
P. Note not taken.
Main issue : can we stand on action taken? If we are going to be driven to do more, better to do it early.
P.M. Political situation. Oppn. will say : i) allegns. of beatings etc., earlier : if action taken earlier on those, Hola need not have occurred. ii) K. Govr condoned use of force. iii) scurvy. iv) Att.G. shd. have prosecuted.
What is best way of meeting that case?
Att.G. My informn. is tht. they will concentrate on (ii) – use of illegal force was authd. by Govt. Forcing the men to work.
P. Can defend this – w’in limits of genl. instructions to police &amp; pn. officers.
Att.G. Can also say that it had no effect on action actually taken.
Hail. Sullivan never saw the letter.
Att.G. His verbal instructns. didn’t authorise force.
P.M. Can we defend it – tho’ admitting the lr. was unfortunately drafted.
Att.G. No new form of enquiry wd. help us – it wd. disclose no new facts.
I agree that Att.G. Kenya was right not to prosecute.
Hail. I don’t. A conviction shd. have bn. possible.
Att.G. No real evce. tht. Sullivan instigated use of illegal force. Nor any evce. to show that deaths didn’t result from legal force.
K. cf. para. 7 of Annex I. Also 10 and 11.
Hail. I see tht. no case can be brought against individual warders : but I believe a case cd. stick v. Sullivan, who was responsible for the whole operation.
P.M. Apart from all that – public opinion will be sore that nothing happened.
K. But serious disciplinary procdgs. are now being taken against Sullivan.
R.A.B. But no share of blame is taken by K. Govr. for approval of Cowan plan. Shd. not there be some censure of Minister who approved it.
P. But trouble occurred because S. didn’t carry out C.’s instructions. E.g. he took them all out at once : he failed to explain what he was going to do before he took them out.
Att.G. Scurvy story, if it comes out, will be grim – for looks as tho’ that caused death in circs. in which it wd. not otherwise have occurred. K. Govr. wd. be v. vulnerable on that count also.
Hail. Don’t defend this plan.
P.M. &amp; H.A. Agree : it is not defensible.
I.M. An enquiry at high level (as in Waters case) wd. relieve public opinion even if it is established tht. no prosecutions cd. have bn. taken.
P.M. More likely finding is tht. the Minister was at fault.
P. Cowan’s method had bn. successful previously.
There is an enquiry into the camps – now procdg.
Att.G. Enquiry cd. not, on facts, add to evidence given before Coroner.
If Minister shd. not have approved Cowan lr., better he shd. resign now.
P.M. All this points to deferring debate until Mon. week. We can say i) no prosecutions practicable, but disciplinary procdgs. are being taken &amp; not yet completed. Can’t rest on that, however. [Must say Cowan plan shd. not have bn. approved.]
Further enquiry on Waters model wd. be unprofitable.
Looking into scurvy problem, wh. also may be unsatisfactory.
But what do you do if [ ] is your conclusion?
Hail. We must assert our authority over K. Govr.
Att.G. May be driven to enquiry into whole conduct of K. Govr.
H.A. There is a case for some enquiry.
Agreed : P’pone debate.
Resume discussion after A.L.B. returns.
[Exit P. &amp; Amory. Att.G.
5. Teachers’ Salaries.
G.Ll. As in memo.
H.A. Omit para. 4. On para. 8 omit 4th. sentence.
I.M. Agree, and believe we shall get a settlement.
G.Ll. Wd. prefer amended para. 4.
P.M. Then keep it v. short.</content>
