  <content>C.C. 56(59). 5th November, 1959.
1. Parliament. [Enter M.R.
R.A.B. Business for next week. Oppn. seeking debate on Radcliffe Rpt.
H.A. 23/xi wd. be convenient – to allow time for discn. in Party Cttees.
2. Foreign Affairs.
S.Ll. a) Security Council
b) . Propose to work for a split-term solution. Poland : then Turkey.
Atomic Test : Sahara
We have drafted alternative. Fr. have seen &amp; like it. It wd. command support &amp; mght get majority. Fr. suggest we, Belgians &amp; Argentines shd. table it. We think no Colonial or African Power shd. sponsor : better get e.g. Scandinavians to do it. Instructns. to PD : keep with U.S. : we can vote v. Afro-Asian resoln. – don’t therefore seek to improve it : work for our resoln. to be sponsored by someone else. . Afro-Asian resoln. (Tel. 769 from N. Yk.) is so extreme that we can safely vote v. it – implications of it on our past tests etc.,
P.M. Diff. emotional atmosphere among our friends in Africa. On other hand we seek to repair Anglo-Fr. relations.
H. Hope we can get milder resoln. Wd. have preferred to abstain on Afro-Asian.
I.M. Operative words in that resoln. are not bad. If we can’t get our milder form, I wd. sooner abstain on Afro-Asian. If we vote v. it, effect will be v. bad – esp. in Nigeria.
R.A.B. If we had worked hard for first, cd. we not stand aside on Afro-Asian.
S.Ll. French wd. never forgive us. They think we are trying to stop them becoming n. power.
P.M. Tel. 780 N. Yk. – para. 2. Fr. are emotional too.
Somethg. to be said for sponsoring milder one ourselves – to show Colonies we were taking positive action.
I.M. Yes : wd. make it easier to abstain on other.
S.Ll. Or we can logically vote v. everything else. Fr. will be furious if we don’t vote against the Afro-Asian : because they know our &amp; U.S. tests have bn. much more dangerous.
P.M. Our resoln. is positive attempt to suspend tests. Cd. we get U.S. to support it.
S.Ll. Latter wd. help.
H. Certainly with Africans.
Agree : i) Work with U.S. for best majority for milder form.
ii) Hope Afro-Asian resoln. mght then fall.
iii) Let it be known discreetly tht., if good majority for ours, we
wd. prob. vote v. Afro-Asian, in its present form.
[I.M. &amp; H. Reminder of serious effect of (iii) in Africa.
Hail. Diff. on merits not to vote v. it.
P.M. Afr.-A. “quite unacceptable” in present form.
After further discussion –
Instruct Dixon as at (i). Ask him wtr he can avoid at this stage committing
himself on (iii) : on basis we hope it won’t arise.
S.Ll. Get Africans to understand facts, as stated by Moch in U.N., &amp; disseminated in Nigeria etc.,
Agreed : C.O. &amp; C.R.O. to do this. [Exit D.S.
[Enter B-C.
3. Pensions: Higher Judiciary.
K. As in memo.
J.M. Ld. Pres. Ct. Session expressed doubts re retiring age.
R.A.B. Fear it will start trouble over salaries generally – and pensions for M.P.’s.
B.C. Will add a little pressure for increased retirement pensions.
Memo. – approved. [Exit B.C.
[Enter Att.G.
4. Territorial Waters.
K. Discns. with Canada were inconclusive. Conference in Ldn. 16/xi with Europn. fishing states &amp; U.S. – to seek another compromise solution. But U.S. have got together with Canada &amp; agreed on 6 + 6., on basis of bi-lateral agreement on phasing-out. They will press this soln. on others at conference.
This is not acceptable : for Norway etc., wdn’t make bi-laterals with us once 6 + 6 had bn. adopted.
We want to persuade U.S. not to circulate to others their agreement with Canada. High-level repns. to U.S. stressing dangers to us – asking for delay until conference – &amp; no approach m’while to Denmark etc.,
Cttee. can then meet &amp; consider future tactics.
Agreed. C.R.O. to send corresp. message to Canada.
[Exit Att.G.
5. European Free Trade Association.
H.A. Reported progress of negotiations.
6. Supply of Arms: Central America.
S.Ll. Long reply from U.S. – reasoned case v. exchange.
x/ Cuba has threatened expropn. of Br. property. Have told Amb. that this reduces chance of favourable answer on aircraft.
I need further time for thought. Disposed to tell Amb. it must now wait until x/ quietens down.</content>
