  <content>C.C. 15 (60).
8th March, 1960
1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter M.R., Profumo
a) Germany.
S.Ll. The Spanish ques is now under control : G. has agreed to N.A.T.O. discussion &amp; it will be taken by Def. Ministers in first instance.
P.M. What is our policy – warm or cool.
S.Ll. Policy is re-armament w’in N.A.T.O. : we must repress tendency for G. to seek some forces outside it. In this de G. has done us a dis-service.
P.M. Wish to bring this to a head – ? in Def. Cttee. – certainly before P.M.M.
*N.B. to organise*
[S.Ll.] Air corridor to Berlin – flying above ceiling. Some months ago we found U.S. were being provocative &amp; restrained them. Jan ’60, Fr. wanted to use Caravels on this route, preferably over 10.000 ft, and U.S. took line we must assert the right again. At our instance agreed to put it to technical control agency : tho’ U.S. wd. agree only to try this for 30 days U.S. have not in fact notified the agency – they are thinking again. I want this handled as a technical, not a political, ques.
b) Disarmament.
S.Ll. Resolved our diffces. with U.S. on presentn. of our new plan.
2. Cyprus. [Enter Alport, Ward.
S.Ll. Approaching possibility of agreement on all save finance &amp; size of bases. Suggest mtg. this p.m. of junior Ministers to ‘constate’ posn. on all the other points.
H.A. Our plan was to finalise all save bases. Will be unwise to conclude money in advance of that. Leave to the end money and bases. Agreed.
S.Ll. Tho’ m’while we cd. chase up a no. of points re composn. of the sum of money.
P.M. Bases. M/Def. minimum area 105 sq. miles. In final phase (but not before) we might trade a little base area for extra facilities outside.
H.W. We shd. need those facilities in blue areas in any major operation.
I.M. Gt. presentational difference btwn. 97 and 105 – a figure below 100. 97:23 wd. be better than 80:40. Cdn’t C.O.S. select best area at e.g. 97:23.
H.W. Must be able to operate the base therefore believe 105 is minimum. Any further concession wd. be in Akrotiri area.
S.L. Cnt we make special arrangement with C. tht. we cd. recover land for addl. airfield, if we needed it in future.
P.M. Believe final decn. will have to be reached by Foreign Ministers.
[Exit Alport, Ward, S.Ll., Perfumo
[Enter D.W.S
3. National Health Service.
H.A. Alarmed. Upward trend on drugs. No control. 2 Cttees. have failed. Australians have given up free drugs, because impossibility of control.
Figure of cost is prob. under-estimate. Ty. think it wd. lead to further increase in existing (panel) drug-bill. This wd. make increase in stamp allthe more necessary.
D.W.S. This is a political issue – not financial or social.
Ch.H. Cost will be even greater because it will increase pull twds. private treatment.
Not so much pressure for this, from doctors or from middle-classes.
I.M. Agree pressure has switched from public to H/C. But, even so, believe majority of Tories in H/C. wd. vote for it.
M.R. Believe pol. health of Party cd. be improved by resisting it ; but I shall need much help.
D.E. V. bad thing to do – repercussions on independent schools etc.’
R.A.B. We shd. have a fwd. look on this : to convince Party. It was in our manifesto in ’50. Can we have a package – limitation of prescribing charges, Pilkington, stamp, etc.,
I.M. We dropped it 1951 manifesto because concern at rising cost – or in any later manifesto.
Hail. We can’t be bound by pledges in old manifestos. – some v. old bogies wd. come out.
P.M. Tactical line, pro tem, shd. be : we can’t do this while we are waiting to see wtr voluntary control over prescribing produces a useful result. And in presenting it to Party link it with broader issues of N.H.S.
[Exit D.W-S., Enter R.W.
4. Wages Policy : Electricity.
R.W. As in memo. Chance of w’spread unofficial action. We cd. support Chairman in standing firm in reln. to that. We shd. not, however, commit ourselves to support beyond that. And, that being so, may be unwise to discuss in any detail with him the likely course of events.
R.A.B. Emergencies Cttee. will meet to-day. If local strikes only, no Proclamation or use of troops.
E.H. Letter of 17/2 from Council is unfortunately worded – as contemplating review of all wages (not merely differentials) in consequence of reduction of hours.
R.W. Chairman regrets this &amp; has said since (29/2) that lr. referred only to differentials.
In speaking to Chairman R.W. shd. stick to 5(a) of C. 41.
5. B.T.C. Railway Re-organisation.
Note of this discussion not taken by me.
[Exit R.W
[Enter Alport, Allen
6. Assistance to Overseas Territories.
Draft of White Paper approved.
7. British Guiana.
I.M. Conference – may break on independence.</content>
