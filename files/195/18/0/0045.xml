  <content>C.C. 58(59). 17th November, 1959.
1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter M.R.
S.Ll. France. Visit went well. Evident they want to impress atmosphere. Arms to Caribbean. Still awaiting Herter’s reply. May P.M. and I decide if decision has to be taken before next Cabinet.
2. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
a) Speaker’s Pension Bill. There will be trouble – and we shall have to push it through. May take ½ day.
P.M. Can’t run away from it. Unwise to contact Ld. D. Make it clear it is appointment made on advice of Australian Govt : [and that salary in these jobs doesn’t wholly cover cost] : provision for abatement dates from time when all such appointments were made on advice of U.K. Ministers.
D.S. Wd. Austr. Govt. like [ ]?
P.M. Can’t object if point is put generally.
b) Metropolitan Police.
R.A.B. This is ordinary case. N.S.Y’s.Solr. acted for the man &amp; settled, on advice of counsel. I can’t intervene on that aspect.
K. You are in posn. of good employer – &amp; paid for his defence.
R.A.B. Many precedents for paying for defence, if action was taken in good faith. Nothing unconstitutional about that.
S.Ll. Distinction betwn. taxpayer paying for defence &amp; paying for a settlement.
R.A.B. Disciplinary posn. No responsibility of mine – power rests wholly with Commr., who is not prepared to take disc. procdgs. I must uphold that decision.
K. Revised disciplinary code for Met. Police was introduced only 7 years or so ago : wrong for a Minister to intervene.
R.A.B. Recognise that this won’t satisfy H/Commons. Propose to suggest a wider enquiry – pay &amp; condns., powers, public confidence etc., Will indicate tht. I’m ready to discuss with other Parties ques of a general review of relns. of police and public.
J.M. Wd. like to be consulted. Police Fedn. in Scotland may be upset.
R.A.B. Police Fedn. E &amp; W. are in favour of such an enquiry.
P.M. Care over scope.
H.A. Avoid pay &amp; conditions.
R.A.B. A pay claim will be submitted soon : this wd. give opportunity for balanced view.
E.M. Consider in this connection the distraction of traffic work – wardens and tickets.
H.W. Strong support for this.
I.M. Separate issue of pay – Fedn. will run T.U. view on that, and public anxieties will be overlaid. You might have two enquiries.
P.M. Confirm public statement to review of relns. with public, posn. of p. authies. etc.,
3. Commercial Policy : E.F.T.A.
H.A. Majority voting – agreed.
Frozen Fish Fillets. Not yet heard Norwegian re-action to our latest offer. They may press us to go above 20.000 t. Our landings are 900.000 t. v. which this wd. be 40.000 t. maximum.
Fresh Fish. Norway pressing us not to raise tariff above 10%. We have offered a statement tht. we have no intention of doing so. We reserve right to review (re-open) frozen fish issue if fishery limits are extended by internatl. agreement.
Other points – as in memo.
S.Ll. * Agree to Paris, but don’t propose it – because of Belgian susceptibilities.
J.H. Some magic in 20.000 – for this is figure we have put to our f. interests. Moreover Norwegians are really more interested in the system than the amount – for system will enable them to make a bargain with Six in due course.
H.A. We shall do our utmost to avoid any concession.
P.M. Refer back if you can’t conclude on that basis. For Cab. Friday, if need be.
P.M. * Ridiculous to put H.Q. in Paris : this rival organisation. Almost better in Geneva. At least don’t let us propose it.
D.S. Favour London.
D.E. Danger of being near O.E.E.C., as well as Six.
P.M. Lobby for delay in concluding on site of permanent H.Q. But if the others favour Paris, we can’t stand out v. it. I wd. prefer temporary H.Q. Stockholm, at least until ratification : or no concln. until then.
4. Commercial Policy. Canadian Pigmeat.
H.A. As in memo.
J.H. Must do something for Canada. In 2 yrs. we shall have to accept full liberalisation. Clear tht. Canada will then come back into our bacon market. W’out balancing factor of liberty to reduce Polich imports, we shall have trouble with our producers and also heavy load on b/payments. Also wd. upset Denmark.
Won’t be so difficult as F.O. fear. Poles are going v. short of meat themselves in order to build up their export market here. Poles are coming here to ask for quota of 52.000 vice 47.000 t.
P.M. We can tell Canada we must adjust slowly.
J.H. Admit the frozen pork. (Canada) and then progressively raise quota for Canadian bacon. M’while warn Poles that their quota will have to come down – &amp; begin reducing now, by 6-month instalments.
H.A. Fixing now only the 1st. instalment.
R.M. Will damage our exports to Poland.
P.M. Make a 6 months deal on that basis.
Remind Canada tht. they are running a pro-Polish political policy.
5. Bank Notes.
P.M. I disliked £2 note alone. This more numerous plan is less difficult.
R.A.B. Don’t like it.
P.M. Will put up tipping standards!
J.H. Serious psychological objns.
Approved – save for £2.
6. Companies Act etc., Enquiry.
Agreed – subject to circuln. of text of statement to Cabinet.
7. Land Drainage.
J.H. As in memo.
Agreed.</content>
