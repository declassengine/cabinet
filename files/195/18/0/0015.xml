  <content>C.C. 23 (59). 14th April, 1959
1. Germany : Talks with French. [Enter E.H.
S.Ll. French are more flexible in private than in public over Berlin. Evident they won’t allow it to drift to crisis. Realism over espionage in W. Berlin etc., Their public posn. is designed to placate G.
P.M. They may be too flexible under pressure : they mght run out.
They think F.M. shd. work twds a Summit mtg. They evidently accept need for it.
2. Nuclear Tests: Geneva Conference.
S.Ll. U.S. decided to forestall new R. initiative. But fwd. new double proposal : if R. unwilling to w’draw veto in comprehensive agreemt., offer a limited ban on tests in atmosphere up to 50 km. R. re-action, tho’ negative, is mild.
Good-will invested in this Conference : must not appear tht. we have allowed it to break down.
3.
Trade with Russia.
P.M. Malik has asked us to make formal request for mission to go. This has bn. done &amp; made public by R.
S.Ll. Wise – subject to condns. which have bn. made plain : and subject to delay on one month. But we shd. now go fwd. on that basis – otherwise we shall appear to have raised matter in Moscow for purely propaganda reasons.
D.E. Substantial orders placed last wk. by R. with Vickers &amp; Courtaulds on normal medium-term credit terms.
Agreed : D.E. and S.Ll. to concert arrangemts. – for mission.
D.E. to accompany mission at outset – tho’ he cd. return &amp;
send out junior Minister instead.
S.Ll. Leave no room for misunderstanding re credit.
4.
Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
5.
Cotton Industry.
P.M. Industry seen : regard offer as reasonable &amp; practicable : reporting to their Executive Cttee.
D.E. Must be presented as re-organisation not as bankruptcy operation. Bill is in preparation.
Noted – with satisfaction.
6. Future Status of Post Office. [Enter P.M.G.
H.A. P.M.G. wants to stress commercial nature of his Dpt.’s operations. This plan wd. do so.
Believe Parlt. wd. still want some sort of annual Estimate. P.M.G. wd. be reluctantly ready to agree to annual Parly. renewal, by resoln., of his authy. over the Fund.
Contributions to Exchequer } out-standing differences : but these are
Payment for agency services } separate ques.
What do Cabinet think? What will Parlt. think? If Parlt. wd. agree, Ty wd. be content.
P.M.G. Payment in &amp; out of Consolidated Fund : disadvantages:-
i) Ty. control : leads to delay &amp; inefficiency.
ii) Distorts Budget above the line. P.O. cash surplus is included as Ty. profit.
iii) Double accounting : dangerous practice!
iv) Estimates are meaningless fr. angle of trading concern : sensible only qua
Proposal made by Ch.H in ’55 will expire in ’61. spending Dpt., which we are not.
Seek decision on para. 12. issue – annual resoln.
Wd. show we are ready to make natd. services work – with fresh mind.
K Constitutional aspects.
Case is made out on merits – to avoid wasted effort.
But diffy. is in para. 9 of Annex B. Parlt’s control thro’ annual voting of money. Retrograde to try new plan plus submission of Estimate : attracted therefore by para. 12 proposal. This annual renewal of authy. mght be accepted by Parlt. as sufficient. P.M.G. wd. be well-advised to accept this device – as means of fore-stalling criticism from purists, pedants &amp; historians.
R.A.B. i) Shd. consider this in reln. to our general approach to ques. of nationalisation e.g. re-organn. of N.C.B., de-centralisation of gas &amp; electricity.
Can we consider timing, in particular, in reln. to those ques.
ii) Attitude of Parlt. First departure fr. principle of Consol. Fund. Also annual voting of money : not sure para. 12. will do.
iii) Ty. control. If none over nos., other control over staff is unreal. Is that consistent with remaining subject to P.Q.’s.
M. Contribution to Exchequer. Natd. indies. : notional on turnover. I object to that because a) not related to profits b) ignores nature of profit.
P.M. What is basis of existing contribn.?
E.M. Takes a/c of taxes we don’t pay e.g. motor vehicle licences. Only £.0.8. M is in lieu of profits &amp; income tax.
M Contribn. related to turnover wd. introduce a wholly new principle.
P.M. Let this be considered by all [Ministers concerned with natd. industries] plus a pundit on the Parliamentary procedure etc.,
H.A. This is separate point, wh. I will be ready to consider with [].
I.M. Is this an attractive political plan? Commercial undertakg. run by C. Servants : less attractive than natd. industry á la Board.
Hail. Au contraire I like this. Imaginative &amp; constructive.
P.M. Can’t be done in this Parlt. In the nature of a manifesto. Let it be considered by ad hoc Cttee. composed of L.P.S., Ch/Exch., M/L., M/P., M/T., P.M.G. &amp; Ch. Whip – esp. in reln. to proposals for manifesto on natd. industries.
[Exit P.M.G.
7. International Development Association. [Enter Alport.
H.A. Anderson thinking of 1 billion. We cd. support that – tho’ we wd. get larger benefit from larger plan.
Favour this plan. a) U.S. Govt. are under domestic pressure to reduce dollar aid. We ought to be helping them to resist that.
b) From experience, we benefit in trade to an extent larger than our contn. On Bank &amp; U.S. mutual aid, propn. spent on U.S. goods has steadily fallen &amp; that on U.K. goods has increased. As scale of aid is much larger than anything we cd. do unilaterally, it must be to our advantage.
For these reasons we can stand the limited extra strain on our resources.
Also c) we don’t want a Sunfed type of scheme.
S.Ll. Support this plan. Risk that Congress will press that all aid shd. be in U.S. goods shipped in U.S. bottoms. This is a good way of avoiding that.
Wd. prefer 2 billion.
A.L.B. My earlier doubts relieved : esp. by para. 11. Support this plan.
H.W. So wd. I. – on assumptn. tht. this cd. not be tied up to U.S. ships.
Alp. Support it, also. Tho’ if we can’t meet all our commitments in future, Commonwealth loans might rank below this contn.
H.A. Hope that won’t arise.
P.M. Converted to this – partly because dislike Sunfed more. Will you earn £450 M. on b/p. in 1959/60? But this won’t matter if we get orders for U.K. goods.
Agreed : support plan. Consider later wtr we shd. argue for 2
billion vice 1.
[Exit Alport.
8. John Waters. [Enter Ld. Adr., Att.G.
J.M. Police authy. acted properly. No evce. on wh. criminal conviction cd. have bn. obtd. But Police officer did hit the boy : and another offered money to get complaint w’drawn.
Publication. Propose to publish report and evidence, on 15 April.
Disciplinary procdgs. Initiative is with Ch. C. If he decides not to act, no-one can move him.
Diffies – i) indemnity offered to witnesses. ii) circulars : tho’ in law they don’t exclude possibility of action.
R.A.B. Better not to make any statements. Publish report &amp; evidence on Thursday. Give guidance to Press on responsibility for disciplinary procdgs.
K. Amnesty &amp; circulars add up to assurance tht. there will be no disciplinary procdgs. – at least for the assault.
Att.G. Procdgs. v. Gunn wd. be breach of faith.
Technically they cd. be taken v. Harper for ‘other’ conduct. But even that wd. seem to be breach of faith because [after all this publicity it can’t be supposed they wd. get a fair trial.]
Problem is how to secure tht. there won’t
Dep. Ch. C. can seek advice on this : tho’ Govt. shd. not give him directions. We cd. advise Chairman of Ch. C.’s Assocn. of []. be disciplinary procdgs.
Hail. To use Tribunal’s report as means of enabling disciplinary procdgs. wd. be abuse of Tribunal procedure.</content>
