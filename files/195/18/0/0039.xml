1st September, 1959
1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter E.H. Germany.
P.M. K. has swallowed bait w’out taking hook. Visits : but no commitment to Summit. Long-term therefore not v. happy. But in short-term Alternative B. has not turned out too badly.
E.’s reception in U.K. v. moving. Public reject view of experts that he is finished. Since Dulles’ death he has roused himself.
My immediate objective : avoid any row with K. in this interval : Keep all balls in the air.
S.Ll Diffy. : bring home to U.S. odd sitn. tht. you invite to dinner someone with
S.Ll. whom you are unwilling to do business. Disappointing tht. E. still insists on “progress”. We must insist on a business mtg. in due course : successful visits cd. be “progress”.
On substance, E. thinks A. is more flexible on moratorium and on a new soln. for Berlin and on contact betwn. 2 Germanies. This is encouraging.
E. has promised to avoid open disagreement with K. But both men are impetuous &amp; touchy. France. Over Algeria we have tried to get U.S. to see diffies. of multi-racial society. de G.’s text : pacificn. followed by free choice. Hope we can all support that. U.N. mtg : must get Fr. to handle it &amp; we cdn’t do it for them as AngloFr. relns. are now so sensitive.
Disarmament. At one with U.S., on new body.
Nuclear Tests. Recessed until 12/x. M’while, posn. is : we hope R. will consider new scientific data. U.S. have extended the moratorium until end/year. R. have now said they won’t be first to resume testing.
W. Indies Base. Tactics. Better to go on &amp; sound out W. Indies.
Wool. U.S. are announcg. to-day another review of the tariff. May get results by Jan.
Laos. They won’t have Commn. back because undermine their authy. Lookg. for some means of getting observers – to boost Laos &amp; deter communists. Contact with Nehru, who shares our anxiety &amp; is realistic. Alternatives : i) Laos shd invite Sec. Genl. to send someone ii) No. of interested countries shd. ask U.N. to send observers. Other plans too. No one agrees with other’s plan. No U.S. intention to turn it into a mil. base.
U.N. Assembly. Worst thing will be Fr. tests in Sahara.
A.L.B. Is it to this that R. declaration is aimed.
P.M. No : language is in terms of “resumption”.
A.L.B. Wind fr. Sahara blows into Nigeria.
S.Ll. Shall try to help Fr. to get this merged in a genl. debate on Disarmament.
S.Ll Europe. Secured lip-service from U.S. for the Seven. Urged H. to say somethg. publicly.
P.M. If we are returned to power, we can take new initiatives with force. M’while we command no authy. with G. or F. Can talk intimately with U.S. Otherwise, let this be a pause.
H. China. Nehru has now openly described this as aggression.
H.A. Will damage Ch. prestige with the uncommitted.
S.Ll. Moderates in China are out of favour : increasing toughness. May be cross at suggn. tht. R. &amp; U.S. can settle world affairs à deux. Even so, odd to upset India. Tho’ they are genuinely cross with them over Tibet – for allowing Dalai L. to talk.
2.
Economic Situation.
H.A. Short-term borrowg. rate in U.S. is higher than here. Some money has therefore bn. crossing Atlantic. Even so, Plus £10 M. on reserves for Aug : v. good for this month.
Iraq has drawn £30 M. of sterling balances – spending some &amp; putting some in other currencies.
Expectn. of rise in Bank Rate. As result, gilt-edge prices faltered but have now recovered. Have feared weakness there as prodn. increases &amp; equities rise. Has not gone badly.
Radcliffe report. On balance will be useful. Will strengthen Govt. v. Bank. Remarkable tht. it is unanimous.
P.M. Shd. Ty. circulate a summary.
R.A.B. Doubtful : there is a good summary in Economist.
P.M. What are points of danger? [For Central Office : not Ty.]
3.
Colonial Affairs.
A.L.B. Kenya : Africans are at 6’s and 7’s. Will help us in constitutional conference next year.
C. Africa : we have invitation.
Nigeria : I’m worried about Fr. test in Sahara.
4.
Employment: Individual Relations: Wages.
I.M. i) We shall place these school-leavers. : &amp; adults are doing better. Therefore Sept. figures will be satisf.
Shan’t now fall below 400.000. May be 1.9%
ii) T.U.C. If we win, it’s a moment for high-level talk.
iii) Wages. If Co. reports are satisfy., we shall have to press for reduction of prices.
5.
Crime.
R.A.B. a) Enquiry into Carlton Approved School. Indication of bad spirit among young. Shall have to tackle this.
b) Open Prison at Ford. Shall not tell Pn. Commn. tht. it won’t go fwd.
6.
Coal.
M. NCB’s draft plan leaked, after confl. commn. to N.U.M. Expect they will meet again this month &amp; submit to me for approval.
Miners’ superannuation. Retirement at 65 + payment of £200. Have warned N.C.B. I shan’t be able to approve (because of repercussions) ; but will try to delay any row.
Price changes went w’out public fuss.
7.
Legislative Programme.
R.A.B. D/Industry Bill : want it ready when Parlt. meets.
D.E. Hope we can do that. Five major decns. required : will submit these, for consn. by H.A.
R.A.B. Betting &amp; Gaming also needed before Xmas. Will submit to H.A. Cttee. ques re Jockey Club (levy on bookmakers) Think there will have to be enquiry. We must then take powers to apply any scheme wh. proves to be practicable.
8.
Trade.
D.E. R. agreement
Disposal of now concluded.
rubber stocks – Anglo/U.S. agreement.
Cotton
Absorption of workers : examining this by localities. The D/I. Bill will be the answer.. We thought we shd. aim at 6. m. spindles redundant. We have had applns. for 12 m. This gives chance of small efficient industry. Looms : 270.000 in all : we took target of 45.000 but have had applns. for 90.000. This, again, wd. leave a healthy industry.
Exports. Feeling growing tht. ECGD are not doing enough on long-term credit. But see no reason for haste : credit is doing well enough.</content>
