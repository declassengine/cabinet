  <content>C.C. 1(60). 4th January, 1960.
1. Kuwait. [Enter M.R.
S.Ll. Cab. approved proposals re Kuwait. Progress is quicker than expected. Ruler wants us to relinquish much by Feb. 23(?), when he celebrates his accession. Will mean substantial w’drawal of civil jurisdn. &amp; some complete abandonments – nothg, prob., on criminal jurisdn.
2. East Africa : Land Forces.
I.M. Constitl. progress is going quicker than we previously thought. There is a case for retaining (resuming) administrative control of troops.
This is a good time at which to do it. Propose we do so from 1.7.60.
Finance. Kenya cd. now make a contn. The other two cdn’t – real cost wd. fall on U.K. Believe it wd. be better for U.K. to carry cost.
Kenya Confce. starts 18/i. Represented to me there tht. proposals re African agriculture &amp; educn. wd. increase chances of success at that conference. To waive local contn. to defence wd. be great help there.
C.S. Administratively &amp; militarily this wd. be advantageous. If we don’t do this, we shd. have to give more control to the territories.
H.A. Reversal of policy followed h’to (deficiency grant). Odd at a moment when we are favouring advance to independence.
Repercussions – e.g. Singapore, W. Indies &amp; S. Leone.
Cost : £3 M.
Wd. like time to explore possibilities of compromise solution.
H. Is it right, when they are moving to independence, to impose U.K. control over Forces. Odd moment at which to go into reverse.
I.M. Defence will be reserved subject.
H.B. Reversing decn. taken only 2½ yrs. ago – &amp; justified on basis tht. countries shd. learn to stand on own defence feet.
R.A.B. Good if we intend to dig our toes in. I wd. favour it. Unhappy about pace of progress.
P.M. Assumptn. is tht. progress in K. will take 5-10 yrs. Better to have Forces in Govr.’s control. That is I.M.’s view. Other view is tht. if they appear to be foreign Army re-action will be worse.
I.M. Trouble is tht. progress in K. will be slower than in other two.
H.W. Cd. be justified on mil. grds : but decn. must turn on political consns.
H. Will you be able to continue to recruit Africans to these forces, if we resume control?
C.S. Doubt it, unless Parties put a political ban on joining.
H.A. Think this is open to more objn. on pol. than on financial grounds.
K. A necessary measure of insurance.
H.B. How do we present this?
I.M. Govrs. wd. ask for it.
P.M. Wd. the new Governments ask to be relieved of this responsibility?
P.M. Let H.A. discuss finance with I.M. But, if we do it at all, we had better have no contribution.
Cabinet shd. then have another talk on political aspects – next week.
[Exit C.S.
[Enter Att.G.
3. Law of the Sea.
K. Conclns. of Cttee. at mtg. this a.m. – as in brief.
P.M. Worst thing for us wd. be 12 – either by ⅔rds. (obligatory) or even by simple majority (wh. wd. make it hard to contest cases before Int. Ct.).
But, politically, we must seem to be doing our best for fishing industry. Yet may be dangerous to press to long for a solution wh. we can’t secure.
Nature of repn. at Conference makes it more important than usual to lobby Govts. – in advance.
J.H. Agree essential to get 6. Only diffce. is on tactics. There are signs of support for phased out 6 – e.g. U.S. &amp; Latin Americans. We have mooted it with
y| Europeans and U.S. – we shdn’t run away from it so soon. No hint until mid-
Feb. of readiness to accept 6 + plain 6.
Att.G. Real danger from Mexican proposal, which contemplates flexibility. Don’t do anythg wh. reduces our chance of preventing 12 miles or break-down. We can’t do a deal with Iceland at present : but our action on Iceland will count v. us with smaller countries. If we wait until Conference, w’out advance lobbying, we lose chance of mobilising Commonw. &amp; Europe v. 12 miles. I believe 6 + 6 is best chance of defeating that. But we cd. leave Canada to do the lobbying pro. tem.
At conference, better to get someone else to put up 6 + phased out 6. We shd. not show our hand too soon – to all : tho’ wise to let our friends know our views. E.g. make a joint plan for aiming for 6 + phased out 6 in Cttee. stage, but if that failed go for 6 + 6 in final plenary.
S.Ll. All agree tht. 6 + 6 with historic rights is out.
Can’t we begin with 6 + phased out 6, but we ready to switch to 6 + 6. Tho’ I agree it wd. be better to let others run the first.
J.M. Agree. For,
H. Can we not mobilise enough to block ⅔rds. for 12 miles?
J.H. Yes.
D.E. x/ At least wait until we know results of Dean’s lobbying for 6 + phased out 6.
P.M. { Avoid indicatg. our fall back posn. (6 + 6) until x/.
{ F.O. to expedite replies to Europeans as at y/.
[Exit Att.G.
4. Europe.
H.A. Position is confused. Things are moving fast. Dillon attendg. OEEC mtg. on 14/i &amp; likely to say tht. U.S. will join in their discns. on aid. Paris mtgs – congested p’mme – 11-14 Jan.
Proposals. i) apptmt. of standing group to consider trade (6 &amp; 7) &amp; aid.
Wd. include 5 of 6., E. Commn. , 4 of 7, U.S. &amp; Canada.
ii) aid to be considered by a Sub-Cttee.
iii) 4 wise men to consider re-organn. of O.E.E.C. (to bring in
U.S. and Canada as full members). Basis of re-orgn. not
known : might be comprehensive (incldg. Japan) or
restricted to donor countries : Atlantic basis mght be thght
by Eur. neutrals to be too close to N.A.T.O.
Risk. May destroy OEEC., isolate 7, and leave 6 the victors. This may be what French want.
Our objects : a) safeguard &amp; strengthen the 7.
b) support U.S. &amp; Canadian membership of a Eur. econ. assocn.
c) avoid destruction of O.E.E.C. until efficient alternative in
sight.
Doubtful about (iii) above : these wd. be people independent of Govts. We shd. insist on representatives of Govts.
Composn. of (ii) above will need careful thought. Must keep A &amp; N.Z. in mind, as well as 7.
R.M. Agree. U.S. have rushed in before knowg. what they want. Hope bridge.
x/ betwn 6 &amp; 7 will be high on agenda of any new ‘group’/organn.
S.Ll. Accept H.A.’s objectives. Share his suspicions of French objects. We must insist on x/. Devise small matters on wh. 6 &amp; 7 can come together.
Remember tht. it is we who wd. have to pay price (on agric. &amp; Commonwealth) for getting 6 &amp; 7 together.
D.E. What plans have we got for keeping 6 &amp; 7 together? Weak institutions in 7. What plan for equalising investment. Shd. we not seem (because of mood of U.S. &amp; France) to be strengthen cohesion of the 7
H.A. Paris mtg. has assumed a priority over these projects – but they are not yet dead.
M. Danger that 6 (esp. France) may dominate the new group.
D.E. Where does U.S. interest lie? i) To get Europe tariffs down &amp; ii) to get larger Eur. contn. to aid. These economic objects are same as ours. But are they influenced even more by pol. objectives : a united Europe wh., if it included us, wd. be too big?
K. Cd. we have further examinn. of paras 20-22 – v. compressed.
H.W. Some support in Europe for Atlantic concept.
R.M. Dangerous because limits progress of lowering tariffs to U.S. pace.
P.M. Objectives : (1) consolidate &amp; strengthen the 7. (Strengthen its institutions,
consider investment policy etc., – in addn. to tariff act on 1/7
Don’t retreat fr. original concept tht. right final solution is
E.F.T.A. – affirm our faith in bridge.
(2) persuade U.S. tht. 7 can’t be destroyed &amp; tht., if they try to
do so, we shall w’draw fr. Europe.
(3) procedure : we want to cover i) contacts between 6 and 7 ii)
mechanisms for drawing Europ. contns. to overseas aid, so
long as in rapport with I.B.D.A. etc., iii) vote down Wise
Men project.
5. Nyasaland.
I.M. 1) Emergency. 416 detainees: about 75% in N. and 25% in S. Rhodesia. But all are in Federal prisons, &amp; subject to Federal law.
We can get acceleration of rate of releases, &amp; shd. get to hard core soon.
Propose rate of release of 120 p. month : no problem of re-habilitation : no v. gt. security risk. This wd. be 50 in March &amp; get down to hard core (about 12) during that month. Govr. wd. have to have new twilight powers as recently done for Kenya.
2) Dr. Banda. Periodical &amp; special reviews. First due in March. Better to
have him released at a periodical review : not evidently in response to pressure. If Dr. B. was coming out at mid-March, proclamation ending emergency cd. be announced at end/February. – tho’ wdn’t take effect for a time because of legn.
Seek firm decisions now on 1) : but provisional only on 2).
In discussion – views favouring earlier release of Dr. B. Why wait until March?
H. Security isn’t certain. And Fedn. Ministers will say tht. Banda’s release wd. make it even more dangerous. Better wait at least until P.M. has bn. to Salisbury.
M.R. If we wait much longer, we shall seem to have done so in response to particular pressure.
P.M. I must tell Welensky we intend to release B. Wait until I have bn. able to see him. And prs. fix a date after my departure from Union – or during my stay in Union. Agreed
&amp; to Nyasaland. : Approve (1). Reserve (2) for decn after P.M. has bn. to Salisbury
6. Jute Tariff.
