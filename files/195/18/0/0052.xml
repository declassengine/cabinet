  <content>C.C. 9(60). 16th February, 1960.
1. Cabinet. [Enter M.R.
P.M. Gratitude to R.A.B. for skilful handling of difficult ques in my absence.
R.A.B. Glad to see P.M. back.
2. P.M.’s Africa Tour.
P.M. A few impressions.
Diff. time ahead where we have responsibilities.
i) Ghana : may be irresponsible and silly : but rich &amp; homogeneous &amp; will do well enough.
ii) Nigeria : if unity achieved, v. large country, will have good influence on neighbours. Oil may be useful revenue. Fundamentally not a real nation. Aristocratic influence of North – Duke of Omnium. Will the parts cohere? Possibly because attractions of size in present state of world affairs. Br. connection highly prized. Robertson : not fit for independence – 20% loss of efficiency – but after a point you lose by trying to retard, and wiser to let it go.
iii) Union. We aren’t responsible. Having said what had to be said on racial ques, we must now concentrate on our agreements and hold this in Commonwealth. They have played the game with us, in many troubles – we shd. recognise that. And a flourishing country with gt. future (?). Must keep them with us. Much thinking among younger people. Pity Afrikaaners don’t travel more abroad.
iv) Federation. We have the responsibility – it is a v. diff. task. Must move fast enough to satisfy Africans w’out getting Europeans in a panic. S. Rhodesia v. excitable : might act rashly. We have no power – only influence. Must play for time during ’60. Monckton will be more valuable than they think. I have said enough to stress belief in liberal tradition : we can afford to show more considn. for Europeans : keep them in play until M. has reported.
Warning : I returned with grave anxiety about future of Federation.
H. Tredgold says referendum in S. Rhodesia now wd. produce v. large majority in favour of leaving Federation.
I.M. Effect on Congo decision on E. and Central Africa.
3. Foreign Affairs.
S.Ll. a) Russia. Campaign re R.’s economic aid – quite useful to us : we can argue back. Better talk than war.
H. Caution. K. has done himself harm with Indian opinion : they don’t like to be told how much they are being given.
A less bitter form of cold war.
b) Nuclear Tests
Enter G.W., J.A. . Our role : to keep negotiations going. Opinion here will press for moratorium on underground tests below threshold. Awkward : for that is our view.
4. Cyprus.
S.Ll. Tactics : seek agreement on all points save sovereign areas. Govr. hopes to have a report on all these by to-morrow. Better prs. to send a Minister out than allow Govr. to come here – but depends on nature of report.
No sign of recrudescence of violence or Eoka.
J.A. Mistake to allow Ldn. Cttee. to resume.
Diffy. is to know wtr M. wants an agreement or not. Favour giving an ultimatum, end of this week – no sacrifice of principle.
H.W. 80 sq. miles + 40 facilities wdn’t do for us. We might make a small final concession to clinch it : but nothing of that nature. Not much less than 120 wd. be defensible as militarily sound.
I.M. 97 &amp; 23 wd. surely satisfy us, as final deal.
S.Ll. Must keep this until all others settled.
P.M. Don’t forget larger issue : B. presence in E. Medn. is necessary to hold G/T. balance. Friendly republic is essential to working of our base. Must therefore look at it as a whole. Our relations with them are more important than size of our base.
S.Ll. i) They are worried over unemplt. &amp; asking us to re-start works. Surely we shd. not do that, until we know where we stand.
I.M. Agree.
S.Ll. ii) We shan’t get facilities w’out some contribn. We have declined an express link – &amp; limited financial offer to 5 years. Cd.we not admit their request to review it again after 5 years?
H.A. The bill keeps rising – was £4 M. : now suggested it may be £15 M. Must reserve my posn. re
Our presence alone will make large contn. to their revenue. instalment for 61/62.
P.M. How bring all this to a head?
J.A. When T. Cypriots separate from M. because he won’t accept our terms. That is only hope of bringing him to heel.
H. 97 + 23 need not be militarily unacceptable, surely – if the 23 is in the Treaty. Can’t we consider that?
I.M. x| Want to make it clear to M. that we will settle sovereign areas when everything else is settled.
J.A. He has bn. told that orally.
P.M. ?Say : J.A. has reported his conversation : when all else is settled we will discuss size of sov. areas, in light of considn. of what he has said to J.A.
Agreed : i) Govr. not to return to London.
ii) Decide, on his report, wtr Minister shd. go out to seek a final
settlement.
iii) Decide (? Wed. or Thurs.) wtr we send message at x/.
.
5. Industrial Disputes : Railways. [Exit Home, G.W., J.A.
[Enter Wood, Erroll.
E.M. Last rise mid ’58 : then Gillebaud Cttee. to analyse comparable wages in outside industry. Further expln. of history of negotiations. Gillebaud Rpt. will be publd. in week beginning 29/2.
Pressure to re-consider finances of B.T.C. and re-organisation.
Finance : we have bn. paying below the line – £289 M already.
P.M. Problems are : i) what does Govt. do on Gillebaud Rpt.
ii) what do we do about putting rlways on their feet, without
bleeding country to death.
M. G. Rpt. will be v. long. Protracted negotns. will be required.
H.A. If we don’t dispute findings, we shall have to say tht. they are only acceptable if spread over about 2 yrs. and applied to a smaller no. of men. Such a statement mght provoke a strike. Differentials : we cd. promise review with some interim payments on a/c. Mght be £7 or 8 M. more. Then a detailed study of Rpt., results of which wd. not come into wages bill until 1961/2.
E.H. B.T.C. are not capable of handling this with Unions.
D.E. In a private industry, the Bank wd. nominate members to Bd.
x/ Maybe Govt. shd. take over for 2-3 yrs.
E.H. Not sure of x/. Big strike, with Govt. as direct party to it! suspected already of delay, in Gillebaud: can’t spin out study of their findings.
P.M. Phased opern. of increases vice slow study of Rpt.
E.M. NUR won’t agree.
E.H. Not sure : they have many skilled.
P.M. 2 Memoranda at E.P.C. : I will preside.
[Exit S.Ll.
6. Iron and Steel Industry.
H.A. Shd. we proceed to sell equity of R.T.&amp;B., and the rag-bag of a number of odds and ends? The market is open now, as it was not before Election. Recommend tht. the Agency shd. now ahead – trying to sell prior charges as well as equities.
M. Support.
R.W. So do I. some pol. pressure, and we shd. be in diffy. over it if we waited until another Election is in sight.
Will be raised in Thusday’s debate ona small Bill re accounting. Shd like to be authorised to say somethg.
H.A. He cd. say Agency will go on with its duty &amp; that R.T. &amp; B. won’t be excluded.
P.M. 1) try to sell prior charges as well as equity.
2) R.T.&amp;B. Try to float off some of Govt. loan on to public in debentures.
Approved, subject to (1). [Exit Erroll &amp; Wood.
7. Kenya.
I.M. Compromise solution commands wide support. Briggs will stand out on re-actionary line, which will be popular with Europeans in K. But Blundell &amp; Africans are ready to commend it jointly to the Kenya public. Council of Ministers will be 7 Europeans, 4 Africans and 1 Asian. Franchise &amp; Ch. Minister : K. will be going slower than Tanganyika or Uganda.
Ask Cab. to agree tht., if I can get this thro’ Conference, Govt. will support it. Plan in C.P.C.(60) 3.
Approved.</content>
