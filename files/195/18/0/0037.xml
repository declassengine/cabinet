  <content>C.C. 47 (59).
28th July, 1959
1. Pensions of Higher Judiciary. [Enter J.B-C., O.G., E.H.
Future pensions. x/“Authorised prepn. of legn. on basis outlined in memo.”
Existing pensions. Will be contracted with Colonial servants.
Lord Symons. To secure him the better of alternative pensions. Agreed as at x/.
2.
Mr. Speaker’s Pension.
R.A.B. x/£4.000 &amp; something for his wife but no lump sum. Even this wd. set a
precedent.
P.M. He has asked for less – diminished pension in considn. of wife’s pension.
E.H. Any change will raise ques of pensions for Members. Agreed : prepare legn. on basis of x/.
3.
Agricultural Policy. M.A.P. Grants. Announcement. Agreement reached on formula – and on announcement by letter in August. N. Ireland.
R.A.B. There will be a row from Belfast.
P.M. Why not tapering off scheme for N.I. too?
H.A. Because they wd. then get double value. They do benefit from Small Farmers Scheme.
R.A.B. * Register my dissent. But content on that basis, tht. we go fwd. Approved
[Enter Hail, H.B. , subject to *.
4. Investment Programme. 1958-63. [Enter Boyle, Thompson, D.W-S.
H.A. As in memo. Recent experience illustrates diffy. of securing quick re-actions, up or down, even in public sector. But some things move pretty quickly – e.g. housing.
And in autumn we may want to ask for redns. there – housing, educn. minor works, gas and prs. B.T.C. (figure in memo is £30 M. less than rlways’ demands : but I may have to ask for more). Changes required wd. not be v. large.
H.W. Accept £220 M. pro. tem., but subject to re-appraisal.
[Roads expenditure dropping wd. not be acceptable for Party manifesto.]
M. Accept this.
D.W-S. No objn.
E.B. Minor works cut provokes much more political trouble than the money it saves. Timing is therefore important.
H.A. Not saying now that this will be necessary at all, and shall certainly consult G.Ll. on timing.
H.B. Housing. Miscellaneous.
I.M. Planned increase over 5 years is only £90 M. H.A. speaks of cutting £35 M. off this v. small target.
Cuts in housing &amp; educn. minor works immediately after winning Election wd. look v. bad.
H.A. But remember private sector – wh. wd. get a big stimulus from such an Election result.
D.E. Does this planning work? On last experience, not for inflation : the jump came much too late.
Fringe projects, identified as quick re-acting, are the most unpopular. Do they really help the economy much?
If you have to cut back, better to do so by restraining private sector by dearer money.
H.A. I’m not asking for any decisions to-day.
P.M. This estimating is both difficult and dangerous. Mistaken to suppose tht. estimates of out-turn of public expenditure are more reliable than those of private sector.
y| Remember probable collapse of ship-building industry. We may need something to off-set that.
Take note of this memo., with scepticism and recollection of y/.
[Exit D.W-S., E.B. Thompson.
5. Atomic Energy : Nuclear Merchant Ship. [Enter Selkirk.
P.M. Summarised issue – as in brief.
S. Firms are interested. Must retain that interest. Can’t pursue r. &amp; d. effectively unless we get a ship to sea. Can’t at present put fwd. economic propn., but forward-looking people believe it will be important.
Cttee.’s proposal won’t retain interest of firms.
Many new problems for builders, only to be learned in construction ; and in operation ; and in safety. None can be learned until there is a ship at sea.
M. Discussed with E.P. He thinks it will dissipate energies of AEA. I don’t think that is decisive. I wd. prefer to go ahead – even at some risk.
D.S. So do I.
J.M. Sure it’s right tht. we can’t develop w’out a ship at sea. True even of conventional types.
H.W. Sympathise with that view. But owners don’t favour B.W.R. Also nervous about safety. If we go ahead with course B., I hope we shall get experience of O.M.R. as well as B.W.R.
P.M. V. large issue. Short notice. Wish to circulate E.P.’s memo.
H.A. Ready to go fwd. But inclined to course B.
Cab. Cttee. to study this further (September).
[Exit Selkirk
K.
6.
Metropolitan Police Fund.
RAB. } As in memoranda.
P.M. }
Agreed : bring this up again later.
7.
Commercial Policy : Import of Canadian Bacon.
H.A Canada used to do quite a trade pre-war. Since war ended, they haven’t be interested because their prices too high. Now their interest is reviving because their prices are likely to drop.
H. supports E.P.R. decision – but will want to ask Cab. to do more if their reply is violent.
D.E. Reply now received – read it out. Protest v. continued restriction in view of tariff decns. re Denmark. Ask for o.g.l. at once.
H.A. No need to go beyond present offer Agreed.
J.H. a) We shall have to open it all in next 12 months. Then Poland etc.,
b) Am proposing to E.P.C. liberalising Canadian butter because rising price.</content>
