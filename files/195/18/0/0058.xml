  <content>C.C. 17 (60).
15th March, 1960
1. Germany. [Enter M.R.
S.Ll. L.S. Govt. have called off idea of flying above ceiling to Berlin.
R. Govt. have bn. reasonable about passes.
Satisfactory – both ways.
2. Territorial Waters. [Enter Att.G., Carrington
J.H. U.S. are in favour of putting alternative A at outset : with support of Australia, U.K. &amp; others. Ques : at what stage do we fall back on alternative B. Hope I have may have latitude on timing.
Drew is now less confident that he was. Admits that our B. is only an amendment of his – and a fair one.
K. If we are to get Europeans along at the end, we must make a prelimy. stand for A. Timing of retreat to B. can’t be determined in advance. Drew expects 56 to vote for B. May get Drew to accept B. in the end.
Att.G. Hope this prognosis is justified.
Agreed : J.H. to have discretion as proposed.
3. Cyprus
[Enter G.W. . [Exit Att.G., Carrington
S.Ll. Let. J.A. slog on with details. But, when they are arranged, summon Foreign Ministers + Cyprus repves. to decide i) size of bases &amp; facilities outside ii) financial ques outstanding and prs. iii) decln. re
Venue. Too much going on at Geneva. G. &amp; T. Ministers will exercise more influence on their communities “what happens in” sovereign areas. J.A. has suggested tht. he shd. open these ques : I wd. prefer not.
in Cyprus. Inclined therefore to favour Nicosia – J.A. remaining.
I.M. Agree. Save that J.A. mayn’t be able to stay in C. until F.M. mtg.
P.M. Can more easily avoid debate if he doesn’t return. Suggest S.Ll.’s plan, as deployed above.
Agreed : as above. [Exit G.W.

Railway Re-organisation.
P.M. Last Thursday we seized initiative. We must m’tain it – by action on Guillebaud report. Let M/T. summon B.T.C. and Unions and set them to work on it. Form of his statement to them can be settled. Issue : do we say we will give B.T.C. finance to enable them to give effect to report. If so, from what date : from publn. of report. Alternative : ask them to finish negotn. as soon as
poss., leaving date open for discussion – tho’ B.T.C. wd. be instructed not to back-date beyond publn. of report. First course wd. have advantage of appeal to public opinion &amp; appearance of strength. Disadvantage : we shd. be committed to that &amp; cdn’t make any concession even to avoid strike.
H.A. Favour first course. V. generous attitude. Cost £40 M. Increases from 8-18%. Fatal to leave anything but differentials to be negotiated. Can’t be forced into posn. of choosing betwn. strike or retrospection – for we cdn’t hope to stand on it.
This wd. mean covering deficit of £120 M. in next year’s Budget – less any savings thro’ increase of fares.
E.M. Believe the row will be on date. When wd. it suits us best to have it. If we will face a strike rather than accept retrospn., better to say at once we will pay from date of report.
E.H. V. unusual to go into negotiation with a firm public posn. But this is unusual sitn. ; &amp; first alternative may be best if we are determined not to have retrospection, even tho’ they strike.
D.S. Don’t nail these colours unless we are resolved to stand by it, strike or no.
M. My judgement is that if we say this at once they will resist it from outset. For they wd. say it was no negotiation.
P.M. First course wd., however, appeal to public.
I.M. This isn’t an ordinary negotiation. There is no employer’s offer. We start from an “independent” finding.
R.A.B. Feeling in H/C. – will expect assurances of Unions acceptance of condns. re-organisation etc.,
Ch.H. Unusual but in special circs. right to declare our posn. at outset. Only hope of retaining initiative is to do this &amp; announce compn. of planning body.
H.A. I can’t face any negotiation on retrospection.
D.E. I support that view. And T.U. co-opn. in re-organisation can only be obtained by pressure of opinion – we can’t get that co-opn. in negotiation.
E.M. Also can’t specify now exactly what we want them to do.
Remainder not heard.
5.
The Currency.
H.A. The new £1 and 10/= notes will be issued to-morrow.
6.
The Economic Survey, 1960.
H.A. My main anxiety relates to our external posn. £1173 M high point last year : now down to £979 M. This is normally a period of growth, and we aren’t doing much more than hold our own.
Imports still exceed exports – tho’ latter are 15% up, former are 20% and no sign yet of any change of trend.
Production has risen well – and above the rise in consumption. Unemplt. down. Small savings (£370 M) v. good. Personal savings up, in total., despite increase in h.p. debt. c/living steady for 20 months. Wages, 1.5% last year, may be at least 5% this coming year. (M/L. figure is below 5%). Pressure of demand = in bldg. industry (10% more than last year) I fear bottlenecks and shortages (tho’ most colleagues don’t agree).
Thus, concerned at oversea posn. At home, with rising Bank lending, time has come to apply some
Form of Survey. Better on balance to keep Pt I this year : as it wd. otherwise be said we dropped it the first time we had to admit indications of trouble. check to rising tide of expansion. Otherwise b/p. troubles and rising prices at home.
P.M. Text of Survey. Omit para. 1.
Para. 14. Add reference to increases in h.p. and Bank loans &amp; make it plain that personal savings have risen despite that.
P.10. H.A. has amendment noted.
E.H. Para. 22, Weighted wage increase over last year was 4.2%. Prodn. has increased by 6%. There is room to absorb an increase in wage rates of 4.2%.
R.M. But in earlier years wages rose faster.
H.A. Will discuss with E.H. – especially re figure of 4.2%.
7.
Suez Canal. Users’ Association.
Do nothing. Agreed.</content>
