  <content>C.C. 30 (59).
7th May, 1959
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
Congestion : need to have Cotton Bill as early as possible.
D.E. Draft available : will discuss with Ministers concerned to-morrow.
P.M. Aim at publn., with W. Paper, on day of adjournment. Take at Legn. Cttee. Tues. next.
2. Germany.
[Re-enter after 2 [Exit E.H.
S.Ll. As in memo : para 11. To enable them to make defensive weapons only, but change needed to cover techn. changes since Treaty.
Seek discretion to support somethg. on these lines, if Fr. put it fwd. If they propose somethg. quite different, Cab. will need to consider again.
P.M. Viz., support Fr. in principle but enlarge limit so as to make it possible for G. to go in for joint prodn. of Superbloodhound with us.
S.Ll. Agreements on nuclear weapons will be announced to-day, from N.A.T.O. Our line will be – implementg. old decision of Dec ’57.
3. Pensions. [Enter B.C.
R.A.B. i) Cost of increasing retirement pension – to Exchequer &amp; contribution. Latter wd. off-set any political appeal. Also wd. need legn.
ii) Increase of n. assistance. More justified on merits. Cost £32 M. Lesser
plan, with fewer adjustments of dis-regards, cd. be done w’out legn. Time-table for larger plan : cd. just be got thro’ by end July and wd. enter into force early in Sept.
Stigma. Need to remove the old age people from the atmosphere of [Enter R.M.
charity. Want to give some impression of doing this.
B.C. Larger version of ii) is on balance the best. Those on assistance have had v. little share in improvemts. since ’48. But I need the larger plan, with legn. This is strongly urged by Chairman of N.A.B. Cannot otherwise be represented as a piece of social policy.
Stigma :easiest course wd. be to print “supplementary pension” on book for aged : and “supplementary payment” on those for younger people on long-term assistance.
H.A. i) must be out. Cdn’t. contemplate it w’out increase in stamp, which wd. be politically disadvantageous.
ii) is the only starter. Questionable what pol. advantage we shd. get from perhaps a little : but no Tory enthusiasm &amp; Labour criticism.
But serious weight on Ty : £18 M. this year (Supplementary) &amp; £32 M. next year – in addn. to v. heavy expenditure forecast. Threatens an increase in taxation equivalent to redns. made in last two.
We shd. therefore consider v. carefully wtr we need do larger plan. I thought of £25 M. as maximum. Now £27 M. on scales + £5 M. on disregards. If we must do disregards, cd. we decrease the improvement on scales. Dislike legn., however : controversial, &amp; pressure to go further.
* Agreed
standing pat. : reject (i) entirely. Choice is between (ii) in some form, or
I.M. (ii) can be presented as advance in social policy.
x/ Cd. we plan whole operation, but leave legn. on disregards to next session
Disregards must be included if this is to be presented as social policy.
Stigma. Mostly words. But much support for a change &amp; I wd. support it, out of sentiment. But avoid increasing stigma on the short-term people (unemployed etc.,).
Ch.H. Hope we will seek further methods of reducing stigma – or talk about it.
M. Support I.M. on that point. Explore that further.
Hail. Had hoped we cd. stand pat. But can’t leave poorest on 1948 standards. Shd. have thght. we cd. do x/. Wd. save £3M.
H.A. Less than that.
B.C. x/ wd. spoil the plan. Share view of N.A.B. that 2 shd. be simultaneous. They wd. argue that scales shd. wait if disregards can’t be done. Short &amp; tightly drawn Bill cd. be got thro’ in July.
P.M. Can we stand pat? Good record on o.a.p.
If we can’t, how much of (ii) do we do : tactics &amp; Parly. row, rather than money.
(ii) won’t please the larger number of people on ordinary o.a.p.
E.H. (ii) wd. please the 1.m. or so concerned, but [it wd. also ease public conscience of larger number.]
We wd. have to make it clear that this is not our answer on o.a.p.
Legn. is difficult this session. Cd. it take the form of enabling Minister now &amp; in future to alter all disregards by Regn.
H.W. and others. Stressed [].
B.C. As regards next year, N.A.B. will propose something of this kind in any event.
H. Doubt if we shall get any political value out of this.
R.A.B. But must consider v. background of Budget concessions to richer people.
B.C. 1.600.000 on NAB., of whom 1.m. are pensioners.
P.M. Can treat them as transitory because as time goes on more of these will have supplements fr. industrial schemes.
I.M. The 10 yrs. qualifying period being now over, all new pensioners get the contributory pension. Pattern has changed since ’58.
G.Ll. Support []. Reception of Budget went unexpectedly sour over o.a.p. We may not get political plus out of (ii) : but we shall avoid further political minus. But nervous of discussion wh. legn. wd. involve.
B.C. Can’t in any event avoid debate – affirmative resoln. on scales.
Ch.H. And I wd. welcome public attentn. to size of disregards. Legn. wd. be valuable from that angle.
P.M. Stronger case for disregards than for scales. Need we do all the scales?
B.C. Less than 5% wd. be treated with derision. [Enter J.M.
Hail. Fear that, if we don’t do this, we may be driven out of a sound position on o.a.p.
D.S. Think we must do this – and change the name. Agreed
Consider form of legn. on disregards : in R.A.B. Cttee. : Proceed with (ii) in full form.
[Exit B.C.
4.
Treasury Control of Expenditure.
H.A. As in memo. This Cttee., as reporting to Ministers, cd. make suggns. on Parly. procedure.
R.A.B. Doubt if we shall escape criticism if Chairman is an ex-Tory Minister.
Proposal approved in principle (w’out enthusiasm).
5.
Transport : Rural Bus Services.
H.W. As in memo.
H.A. Rural M.P.’s (Tories) feel we have done little on this. Services are deteriorating Pressure to remove petrol &amp; diesel duty fr. rural services. But we cant draw a line. Gave limited assistance to all bus services. Our supporters say it isn’t enough for the rural – and want at least an enquiry, so we can say so in Election. But it prob. means a recommn. for subsidy – in 18-24 months’ time.
If approved, I wd. wish to be consulted on composn. of Cttee.
R.A.B. Wd. avoid discn. on Finance Bill.
On merits, there is as much rural trouble over electricity &amp; sewerage.
J.M. If we have a Cttee., it shd. cover Scotland.
Agreed : Cttee. to cover Scotland. Composn. to be settled, in consultn. with
H.A.
6.
Commercial Policy: European Free Trade Area.
No note taken.
[Exit R.M., J.H.
7.
Education: Teachers’ Salaries.
G.Ll. Agreement reached with Ty. on differentials for specialists. Disagreemt. on minimum of normal scale. L.a.’s want to go to £520. That is more than c/living increase over last 3 yrs. and a little less than increase in wages. I have duty to approve : &amp; on than basis I cd. force them to a lower figure but they wd. say that I had bn. unwilling to go further. Dangerous to risk b’down of Burnham for a difference of £2M.
H.A. Cost of (c) wd. be £11 M. in addn. to interim increase of 5% already given. That is bad enough. But, even more, this is a moment when we are aiming at an industrial pattern of 2% : and these figures (about 4%) go far beyond anything which can be justified on c/living. I wd. have preferred (b) : I have improved on that : can’t go to (c). Shd. be possible to persuade l.a.’s that improved (b) is fair.
R.A.B. Cd. M/Ed. convince l.a.’s that improved (b) wd. do?
G.Ll. They are convinced that (c) is least teachers wd. accept. Doubt if I can persuade them to lower figure on their responsibility.
I.M. Improved (b) is risky. (c) wd. be fatal qua effect on wage levels. It is increase of 11% over the years, on c/living argument. I wd. not fear a b’down : a row with teachers wd. not be a disaster.
H.W. Support I.M. qua industrial wage. Ready to risk a row.
J.M. Mine will follow – and that can lead to arbitration. And shortage of teachers is an awkward complication.
G.Ll. N.U.T. attach more importance to minimum than to differentials.
H.A. We must be firm in all wage claims this year – and be ready to risk a row.
I.M. Agree. See what we gained last year by being firm with N.H.S. clerks.
H.A. x/ We must tell them that improved (b) is the most the Govt. can support. Agreed as at x/.</content>
