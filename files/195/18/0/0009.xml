  <content>C.C. 15(59). 10th March, 1959.
1. Civil Service : Salaries of Higher Staff. [Enter P.M.G.
H.A. V. tiresome. But can’t quarrel with Cttee’s. recommns. C. satisfied tht. he cdn’t have recommended any less.
Memo. examines alternatives. I found none satisfactory.
Suggest we accept &amp; implement in full.
i) Announcement : ? now or after Budget.
Am intending to announce Pensions (increase) legn in Budget speech. Maximum increase there will be only £150 – and won’t therefore help to warrant this increase of £1.000. But some M.P.’s think we shd. do or announce Pensions Increase first.
M/L. wants it announced soon, while wages lull continues. On balance I favour announcement just before Easter.
ii) Repercussions. Lower judiciary : &amp; thro’ them on Judges’ pensions. Senior officers of Services (hope that can be resisted).
Little public interest in recommns. when publd. May be decision won’t attract much more.
D.S. Pay of officers – can await bi-ennial review in spring ’60.
K. Masters etc. have kept in step with C.S. salaries. Will need to be raised.
Co. Ct. Judges = increase w’in 2 years : further rise cd. wait a few months but will need to follow Masters. Affirmative resoln. requd. : no legn.
Judges’ pensions : old cases with low pensions – prs. cd. come under Pensions (Increase) Bill. More generally : i) severe drop from £8.000 to £2.650 inhibits retirement : ii) improvements for Co. Ct. Judges etc., will mean that in Sc. and N. Ireland some higher Judges will have lower pensions than inferior judiciary.
Hail. Pensions of Masters and Official Referee : long period of qualification for pension.
H.A. Increase in salaries of lower judiciary is inevitable consequential. Strong case thereafter for increasing Judges’ pensions. Latter might be announced with Pension (Increase) legn.
A.L.B. Also retired Colonial Judges – a handful.
H.A. Will have to be considered.
D.S. Have we considered linking C.S. salaries with those of Ministers &amp; M.P.’s.
D.E. Wd. higher C. Servants refuse increases until Ministers are properly paid?
Hail. Real link is between Ministers &amp; Judges – in logic. But am against touching this, on political grounds.
Ch.H. Commd. to this on principle of comparability (Priestley). Establd. by Coleraine. We shd. accept conclns. – irrespective of Ministers’ pay.
H.B. Agree : but Parly. Secs. won’t like this.
D.S. Agree that this is not the time for looking at link.
E.H. 1922 Cttee. are anxious that this shd. not be announced before Pensions Increase announcement. Wd. sooner it came after Budget.
H.A. Ready to do that, if this is general view. Wd. wish to tell Lord C.
[Agreed]
Hail. I wd. prefer this order of announcement.
R.A.B. Don’t want to link the two.
H.A. Believe M/L. wd. think Apl. 10 or so to be early enough.
Agreed : Accept recommns.
Announce seen after Budget speech.
Repercussions (judiciary etc.,) to be considered.
2. Boards of B.B.C. etc., Salaries of Members.
P.M.G. As in memo. Was a victim of econ. crisis of ’57.This will do no more than bring them into line.
H.A. Content.
R.A.B. Timing?
P.M.G. Can be simultaneous with Coleraine recommns.
R.A.B. More logical to do them first – e.g. now.
Hail. Needs O-in-C. Let it come out in ordinary course as such, w’out special announcement. First Council after Easter.
3. Telephone Service.
R.A.B. Announcemt. re efficiency of telephone service. To be made in H/C. first. And followed by Press publicity.
[Exit P.M.G.
4. Cyprus.
D.S. Propose to resist suggns. of amnesty for Service people convicted of disciplinary offences. No precedent. Quite different from amnesty for civilians.
Approved.
5. Farm Price Review.
H.A. N.F.U.’s this time have no case.
They are urging i) bad weather : strictly shd. not be taken into a/c.
ii) election, as ground for soft settlement.
They ask for reln. to income of ’48 (peak year). But, ignoring weather, this year wd. have bn. as good.
No justificn. for any increase. We cd. reduce by £19 M. Even a level settlement will make it hard to do what we shd. on particular items. E.g. milk : risk of surplus. Eggs shd. come down by 1¼d. Wheat : redn. of 1/=. Also redn. on wool.
Wrong to make settlement wh. is not justified economically in order to appear to get an “agreed” settlement.
J.H. Agree no change wd. be right. But shan’t get ‘agreement’ on that. Turner hoping for £6 M. Think we cd. get his ‘agreement’ for £3 M.
If he declined to agree at £3 M. increase, he cdn’t hope to campaign v. us. We shd. be in strong posn. at Election.
After discussion, general agreement that we shd. pay a maximum price of £3 M. in order to reach an “agreed” settlement – for political reasons.
6. Small Farmers Act.
J.M. Satisfied that this pressure wd. have developed anyway – irrespective of election. Responsible opinion that, if scheme is discontinued, some marginal land will go out of use altogether.
I want para. 9(i). But feel I must also have possibility of legn. in case I can’t find means of solving it by other means.
R.A.B. Hill cow subsidy – won’t it help?
J.M. Wd. ease it : but wdn’t hold it, by itself.
J.H. Para. 9(ii) wd. make it v. hard to hold posn. in E &amp; W and N.I. 40.000 there who will, w’in 3 yrs., go without marginal aid.
Decn. to end it was plainly right. My 40.000 are small men. The disaffected Scots are people with incomes of £1.000 p.a. upwards. If these are aided, what will my small men say? These Scots won’t go out of farming : they may change products &amp; employ fewer men (i.e. from beef to sheep).
Ready to help him in price review – subsidy for hill cows and/or calves. Ready also to lengthen run-down. But to continue marginal aid indefinitely, in any form, wd. be inconsistent with general policy.
H.A. All arguments save political are with M/Ag.
Possibilities { i) phasing, in Scotland – extend from 1 – 3 years.
* { ii) give a hill-cow subsidy out of extra £1 M. on price review.
H. We want to keep these farms on beef.
What about marginal aid over whole of U.K. at a lower level?
J.M. Cost is only £1.2 M. – and money v. well spent.
R.A.B. I believe that * wd. get us out of our difficulty.</content>
