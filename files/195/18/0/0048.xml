1. Parliament. [Enter M.R., Solr. Genl.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
2. Police: Interception of Telephone Communication.
R.A.B. Done by Reading Police with agreement of subscriber. Police were sub-poena-d. L.O.’s advised me not to plead Crown privilege. Tribunal cd. have got the informn. in evce. from subscriber. Wd. have involved extension of privilege.
Police practice – investigating a death &amp; also essential in blackmail.
P.M. Make it clear a) not tapping b) informn. was obtd. in investigation of possible criminal offence. Then pose dilemma : GMC sub-poena cd. only have bn. overcome by use of arbitrary claim to Crown privilege – to wh. genl. objn. on other grounds.

P.M. Long consultns. with Ministers concerned re
If they decline we can either i) find other Parliamentarians of Labour or cross-bench type or ii) go ahead with 3 Tories only, having empty chairs. Inclined to prefer ii). Don’t want to risk more refusals under (i). Must determine this by reference to effect in Africa. co-opn. of Labour Party. Have told Mr.G. tht. I have gone as far as I can to ease his posn. Still no final reply. Have asked for it by 12 noon to-day.

No note taken.
Agreed : present the case to the Court.
8. Law of the Sea. [Enter C. Solr. Genl.
K. Owing to repns. to U.S., we escaped our last diffy. – prev. Cabinet.
Our preferred formula A will not get 2/3rds. majority.
Alternatives : go for B : 6+6+ phasing out of historic rights. Shall we take
that fall-back position? If so, do we tell U.S. in advance &amp; let
them lobby for it? J.H. disliked that idea, because of our
fishing interest.
Latest tels. show tht. Canadians are taking v. stiff line in favour of 6+6 without mitigations. Not only because it’s only one which will prevail : but because they seek leadership of small nations v. imperialist powers!
J.H. This is purely tactics. U.S. wd. try to help : but lobbying means inevitable leakage of our fall-back position. Wd. it be better to tell U.S. in confidence,
x| but ask them not to disclose our readiness to accept it : they cd. give it, in
| lobbying,as their opinion tht. we wd. in the end accept it.
H.A. Support J.H. compromise.
S.Ll. Don’t mind starting off on that basis. But some of our friends won’t try if they think we shall stick to our extreme position.
P.M. Support x/ as tactical position.
S.Ll. We want to get U.S. openly committed to B. If they ask, as condn., tht. we come out in favour of it, we may have to.
K. Para. 7 of my memo?
J.H. Difference : personal to leader of U.S. delgn.
H. y| I shall remind Drew tht. his own plan provided for 5 yrs’ phasing out : he has
| therefore admitted the principle. We must have at least 12 yrs.
P.M. Instruct Att.G. as in para 7. – askg. him to deal with leader of U.S. delegn. personally.
Try Drew out, as at y/. Deal with him not
Att.G. to ask for instns. if Dean wants more latitude. [Exit C., Solr.Genl. by Att. G. going to Ottawa.
9. Police: Royal Commission.
R.A.B. T. of r. don’t extend to police taking evce., Judges rules etc, Those are legal ques. This is concerned with adminve. ques. Composition wd. not be suitable for legal ques.

10.
Kuwait: Jurisdiction.
S.Ll. Shall lose Ruler’s friendship &amp; authy. if we don’t liberalise. This is good moment because there is an Egyptian working on their law.
