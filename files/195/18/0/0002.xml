  <content>C.C.3(59). 29th January, 1959.
[Enter Redmayne.
1. Cotton Industry.
P.M. Exchanges with L.P. and D.E. Hope that in long run the industry will be in stronger competitive posn. We must cash in on H. Kong agreement.
D.E. The industry want to try to produce scheme of re-organisation on their own.
I am ready to join in later. Proposed publn. of exchange of lrs. in this sense with Rochdale.
P.M. In short term shd. wish to appear to be offering some practical assistance. Help to older workers : training of younger. Help twds transformation.
Agreed : Cttee. to consider this : L.P., D.E., I.M., (?) Econ. Secy
2. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
3. Egypt. Financial Settlement.
S.Ll. Agreement will be reached on facilities for the agent.
But diffy. remains over what was Egyptionised &amp; what sequestrated. There is, on this, suspicion on both sides. Believe it can only be cleared up by return of B.R. to Cairo. If this isn’t pushed thro’ now, it will drag on for another 6 months.
Signature cannot now occur until next week.
[Exit Redmayne.
4. Holland.
S.Ll. Anglo/Duch intelligence authies. now agree tht. Indonesia may in next few months have a go at Dutch N. Guinea. This wd. bring Indonesia under Soviet wing – for West wd. be bound to oppose it. We must therefore try to prevent this happening. U.K./U.S./Holland.
Supply of arms – have promise to report to NATO to get agreement.
In delivery of Gannets we can repeat our understandg. tht. they won’t seek to settle by force.
5. Supply of Arms : Dominican Republic.
S.Ll. Mission has arrived to discuss supply of arms – coupled with offer to buy heavy electrical equipment.
But it is unpopular dictatorship – harbouring Batista. Increase of our trade with them may damage our commercial interests elsewhere in S. America.
cf. what happened in Cuba : where rebels threatened to confiscate B. assets if we delivered arms to Batista. We persevered – and are shown now to have bn. mistaken in our judgement.
I’m inclined to keep F.O. out of this.
P.M. Leave them to deal with manufacturers – reserve Govt. decision until last moment on grant of export licence.
S.Ll. They will seek assurances tht. we won’t w’hold licences.
F.O. inclined to say nothg doing for 6 months – while Batista is there &amp; arms might be used for counter-attack on Cuba.
R.A.B. They have other refugees too – e.g. Peron.
P.M. Awkward to turn away orders for 12 patrol vessels – just the order our shipyards want.
S.Ll. Get technical enquiries made thro’ intermediary and re-consider what we can do when we know precisely what he wants.
6. Civil Aviation : K.L.M. Services to Singapore.
S.Ll. As in memo.
P.M. Better to say we are considering technical details – will take a little time – decision will be given as soon as possible.
H.W. Bigger issue behind this. If we appear to waive on political grounds decision taken on sound techn. grounds – it is dangerous precedent for future, by opening door to pol. pressure on each occasion.
Other diffies. with K.L.M. Cd. we offer discussions, at technical level, over whole field : &amp; say Singapore ques will be an element in it. M’while, our decn. on Singapore will stand, but cd. be modified if necessary in light of general negotiation.
S.Ll. In our talk, no agreemt. on figures. Looked as tho’ technical discussns. had not bn. sufficiently thorough.
A.L.B. Dutch are in special posn. (qua creating precedent) because of sudden loss of terminal in Indonesia.
Singapore wd. like rights to continue until June : they believe traffic justifies it.
P.M. We shd. make some concession. It shd. not appear political. Wd. prefer to avoid naming a definite date for a decision. Have it in our own minds that we shall terminate the service soon after election in Holland.
H.W. Wd. still prefer that techn. discns. shd. be over the wider field.
S.Ll. Dutch wd. assume they wd. lose by that.
Agreed : Service to be cut as soon as politically feasible.
But offer technical discussions : seek to establish facts more clearly. H.W. and S.Ll. to devise form of announcement or offer.
7. Kuwait.
S.Ll. Put issues to Ruler, as in memo., &amp; offer to adviser him thereafter. On balance lesser evil wd. be joining Arab League.</content>
