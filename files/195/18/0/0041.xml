Europe. Going to Paris mid-Nov. to discuss diffies. G. won’t help.
Iraq &amp; Egypt. U.N. Debate on Tibet. We supported inscriptn. on agenda : resoln. is v. mild. But [Amendment (?) unacceptable because] we have always taken line tht. U.N. can’t pass on human rights w’in a particular territory. Better therefore to abstain. We can’t complain of aggression because have agreed tht. T. was under suzerainty of China.
H. Agree. Our general line is v. important because of our Colonies.
I.M. I agree.
H.A. Our people won’t understand that posn. because emotionally sensitive.
H. India won’t vote for : abstain or vote against. Deplore any U.N. activity on this because mght unite R. &amp; China.
S.Ll. We can have explication de vote. Agreed.
Arms for Cuba.
S.Ll. Castro wants to exchange his Sea Furies for Hunters. We have got U.S. agreement to general embargo on supply of arms to Caribbean. If these are supplied, embargo will be broken – and supplies will be renewed. It is in our interest not to do this. [Unfortunately, U.S. have announced unilaterally they are supplying civil aircraft &amp; boats.] Propose therefore to tell Cuban we can’t break embargo, but are ready to review posn. from month to month.
P.M. Bring it out publicly tht. there is an embargo. – wh. at the moment is being observed. Stick to this until embargo is broken.
D.E. Cuba may call off our exports, out of pique.
P.M. Avoid final refusal – keep him in play for a week or so. Agreed.
