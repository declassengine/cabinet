  <content>C.C. 22 (59). 9th April, 1959
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
2. i) Germany.
Foreign Affairs.
S.Ll. Nipped – not kicked – upstairs. Trouble ahead : he’s dodging it.
P.M. Adenauer’s speech. F.O. refraining from comment. At our last mtg. he complained of attacks in Br. Press – based on a small appeal for funds for refugees from Nazism : The Ryder Cheshire Foundation. Evidently felt he had to defend present régime v. criticism of anti-Semitism.
We face another gap – possibly until September – with no effective control.
We shd. show no resentment at his outburst.
ii)
N.A.T.O. Mtg. in W’ton.
S.Ll. Three points of difference –
a) Shd. we produce a new phased plan for re-unification or stand on ’55 plan. Offls. produced a new plan. But Germans were unwilling to support or reject it. Believe we shd. go on trying.
b) Thinning out. No criticism in N.A.T.O. – G. stipulating for geograph. area &amp; assocn. with a political initiative.
c) Shd. we try for a new agreemt. on Berlin. Thought this inconsistent with abandonment of existing rights : tho’ understood, after explann., that it need not be. U.S. gave good support : they told G. they must not be so timid over contacts with D.D.R. &amp; that posn. was not tenable in negotn.
W. group resumes in Ldn. on Mon. We must argue there for flexibility on these points. Mtg. in Paris 29/4.
On c) : my line is new agreement “without prejudice” to existing rights. G. are nervous about it because slippery slope.
(iii) Iraq.
Supply of Arms.
S.Ll. Qassim is not a Communist – tho’ he is to some extent prisoner of Communists. Think he wants to be independent of both R. and Egypt.
Turks pressing us to give him arms. He asks for tanks &amp; Canberras. We cdn’t. deliver until 2nd. half of ’60. If we promised them, it wd. become known. Wd. cause uproar here – posn. of I.P.C. etc., Mght provoke anti-Br. outburst from Nasser.
We don’t want him saying we are pro-Communist.
But, if we decline, Qassim will get arms from R. – and that will frustrate non-Communist elements in Iraq.
Not sure it will help Qassim to have it announced now he is getting arms. Told Amb. to put it to him that it wd. suit us both to p’pone this for a time. I wd. then try to hold delivery dates as tho’ order has bn. placed now.
P.M. V. difficult issue. This is Trevelyan’s advice. Spares or ammunition for arms they have cd. be continued. But additional equipment is different.
A.L.B. Prefer p’ponement.
S.Ll. Qassim is certainly getting arms from R. Haven’t established truth of report of Kurds trained in Soviet Union.
D.E. Lee was told in Cairo how Iraq Army was being Communised. E. evidently believe there is nothing to be saved.
S.Ll. We are trying to remove N.’s suspicions that we are backing Communist as. v. him.
Agreed : put the p’ponement idea to H.M. Ambassador.
M/Defence to overhaul plans for action in Kuwait.
3.
Cotton Industry.
P.M. Spoke from F.A.B.’s note. Para. 2.
On rates of grant (para. 3) main ques is one of tactics. Do we bargain up from a low offer : or go straight out with maximum bid &amp; get it settled. On 2nd. course, D.E. wd. ask Rochdale if that is better approach. If he agrees that it is, H.A. wd. accept D.E.’s figures – if industry’s figures are inflated, the diffce. betwn. the 2 percentage figures will not be v. large.
Grateful to Ministers for preparing this scheme. V. gt. pol. advantage to [Enter I.M.
have a concrete plan– as cpd. with vague assurances of Labour Party.
H.A. Quite big money. Total grant £30/40 M. – large &amp; dangerous precedent = for a single industry. Purposes more political than economic.
P.M. Social rather than purely political.
H.A. But, like Price Review, we want agreed scheme. For that I wd. accept D.E.’s figures. (Difference, over the 5 years, may be £10 M).
V. important that we shd. not put our final offer as starting point and then
Re-equipment grant is more dangerous precedent than redundancy. With investment allowances, our total grant wd. be 35%. have to improve it.
P.M. If we can get agreement, it’s worth paying the extra. But not sure about tactics.
In discussion: some feeling in favour of negotiation. But be guided by Rochdale on that.</content>
