  <content>C.C. 36(59). 17th June, 1959.
1. Export of Books. [Enter E.H., O.G.
Ch.H. x/ On further thought, I cd. come down to nil this year and £450.000 next year. A v. modest start. Second year will be less by any savings on overseas b’casting : but I can’t put a figure on that.
H.A. Not large figures : ques. of principle viz., breaking beyond ceiling of £16½ M. Can’t go on adding fresh commitments w’out off-setting economies. Wd. like to see redns. in some other part of oversea expenditure.
Can’t agree until I can foresee the future – prs. in 5 wks’ time – more than increase of ceiling to £16¾ M.
Favour this scheme : want it to start : but can’t go “blind” on new commitmt.
But in all circs. I will accept x/ above.
Agreed as at x/.
2. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
[Enter Wood.
3. Education: Teachers’ Salaries.
G.Ll. Receptn. of my statement was stiffer than expected. Both sides resented Govt. interference.
L.a.’s suggd., &amp; teachers accepted, a 2½ yr. duration for award. Awkward because our argument tht. 4½% wd. set off spiral : for it was related to 3 year period, while industrial settlements are normally (?) annual. Danger of our argument : mght lead to demands for annual reviews by teachers. Choice of £510 + annual reviews or £520 for 2½ years. Is the advantage (if it exists) worth a row with both sides.
Recommn. will come to me formally on 8/7. If I reject it, no chance of teachers getting their increase by October. This mght lead to physical trouble – e.g. working to rule.
If we are to m’tain our present position, we must be clear about our economic case for intervening. Ty. &amp; M/L. were not anxious for me to deploy it publicly.
W. Hope we shall stand firm. The duration offer doesn’t weaken us much. The increase wd. still be 4½% this year – for however long it lasts.
On presentation, dangerous to rely overmuch on economic argument. Cd. we not also rely on educational argument tht. £510 put them in same purchasing power as they had in (?) 1948.
H.A. Don’t see why £510 shd. precipitate annual reviews. Normally Burnham awards run for 3 yrs : no gt. concession for them to offer duration of 2½.
Strong arguments in favour of spending the £15 M. on differentials &amp; higher pay.
But, most of all, weakness of w’drawing from posn. twice taken.
Political (electoral) arguments were then developed.
M. We shall be confronted with many wage claims. We shall have to stand firm. But I’m worried about electoral consequences. We mght be able to present the 4½% as related to 3 year period. Total of 9½% over 3 years wd. not compare unfavourably with successive smaller annual increases.
A.L.B. Continuing row with teachers wd. be v. awkward. And we shd. have to admit we were ready to concede total of £15 M.
M. Prs. offer £520 if they will take a 3 year duration.
H.W. Yes : take a tougher line – on that basis.
R.A.B. Danger if Burnham Cttee. procedure doesn’t work : deadlock &amp; trouble in schools.
Weaknesses : ready to accept £15 M : offer of 2½ years.
Try to get the 3 years – and then accept it.
P.M. 2½ to lodging of next appln. may = 3, takg. a/c of length of negotiation.
G.Ll. Not on their formulation.
P.M. If we stand firm, we must choose a single ground – either the general economic case or a special educational reason.
H.A. I shd. like to know how firm the 2½year offer is.
P.M. Adjourn discussion. G.Ll. and H.A. to consider wtr 3 yr. currency can be made firm. I.M. to be consulted also.
4. Berlin.
P.M. Moving to critical position. S.Ll. has persuaded Allies to table a more reasonable statement of Western position. This, if it can be published, will be defensible. Unlikely that R. will accept it.
[Message to President : his reply : we don’t see eye to eye on action in impasse.]
Decn. of future course of F.M. Mtg prob. on Friday. Alternatives :
a) Short adjournment. [Fr. won’t accept ; they wd. prefer
indefinite adjournment.]
b) 1 month ..
c) 3 months ..
Of these c) wd. not suit us at all.
Initiative – thro’ U.S., if possible, for F. &amp; G. are so jealous of U.K.
On a) – c) my choice wd. be between b) or a final break forcing a Summit.</content>
