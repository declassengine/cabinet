  <content>C.C. 64(59). 17th December, 1959.
1. Trustee Investment. [Enter M.R., P., O.G.
RAB. As in memo.
H.A. Favour going on, despite Commonwealth objns.
P.M. Expressed disquiet – shock to Govt. credit.
K. All modern trusts give a discretion : if we don’t do this we penalise the beneficiaries under older trusts, by leaving them wholly exposed to effects of inflation.
R.A.B. Other Bills – case is unanswerable if Ty. can stand it.
Memo. approved.
2. Offices.
R.A.B. Suggest mtg. of Ministers – incldg. HB., &amp; EH. – to consider posn. We cd. amend Mr. Marsh’s Bill – but only by re-introducing, wh. wd. annoy the H/C. We must also consider our posn. on shops. Prs. we shd. undertake to introduce in 12/18 months a Govt. Bill covering offices &amp; shops.
D.E. Pol. diffy. on shops because growing threat of multiples.
P.M. Review remanetof Gowers field, &amp; have a policy.
R.A.B. Add Ch.H., Vosper, Ch. Whip.
Agreed : report to Cabinet.
3. Anglo-Polish Trade Talks.
R.M. As in memo. In circs. best to agree with them &amp; have only an interim arrangement until we can make a new agreement in spring.
J.H. We shall be clearer, on bacon, in the spring.
H.A. Polish attitude is understandable.
Agreed.
4. Aircraft Industry. [Emter G.W.
D.S. “You appointed me to save the aircraft industry from bankruptcy &amp; collapse.”
They face large prospective (not actual yet) loss of military orders, incldg export of mil. types. : also steeply rising cost of developing new types : and
too often we have missed out on good ideas by being too slow in development phase.
Support for new civil projects – can’t now be limited to revolutionary ones.
Consulted leaders of industry : they will co-operate in rationalisation. Two major air-frame groups is most we can afford. (De Havilland merger with Hawker &amp; Blackburn is a valuable advance.) Vickers/E. Electric are willing to combine ; but I want to add some of the others like Bristols &amp; prs. Faireys : and hope to get the second group formed before or soon after Xmas.
Increased cost of Govt. support – average of £10 M. over 5 years : i.e. from £10 M. to £15 M.
Industry now need rather more precise forecast of extent of Exchequer help.
P.M. How do we approach next stage? A rationalised industry – 2 groups on frames &amp; 2 on engines with prs. a group of funnies (helicopters etc.,). [Weight of U.S. competition based on mil. bombers.] This we all accept. It follows that Govt. help, such as it is, must go to these groups.
What scope will there be for this industry. What prospects for current projects, or for super-sonic (despite v. small market). If we are to be partners, we must share in formuln. of its policy. The character of these projects is as important as their cost.
H.A. Agree we must have an industry &amp; tht. D.S. plan of rationalisation is right.
But want more time on policy – until we can see total cost. Ty. think it will be much higher than £15 M. p.a. That is average, assumes lower figures at end : an assumptn. rarely realised. Danger of aiming at too many types. Probable cost, in resources, of prestige ventures in total – even a transatlantic type, still more a supersonic. Must evaluate sales prospects. Present plan wd. involve another £7½ M next year, on Estimates generally which are £60 or 70 M too high.
R.M. Vickers have a nibble from U.S. Co. for Vanguards – might earn £120 M.
M. D.S. must have backing at least for para. 9 proposals.
D.S. Vickers cd. get order from T.C.A. for a V.C.11 – but wdn’t go ahead w’out assurance of some U.K. orders.
This is most urgent of my problems.
P.M. I will meet with H.A., D.S. &amp; M. next Mon. or Tuesday – on para. 9 &amp; immediate Vickers project V.C.11.
D.E. Sales will be problem, esp. with U.S. and6 having tied markets. [Enter Carrington.
Must, in parallel, seek tied markets of our own – e.g. Commonwealth.
D.S. All this is in mind.
5. Nuclear Propulsion in Merchant Ships.
E.M. No reliable figures of cost – need more technical informn. Do we go for a ship or get tenders for alternative re-actors : If the latter, do we commit ourselves in advance to having a ship. I hope not. Cost of tendering : £½ M., of which we may have to pay half.
C. Only 2 systems are feasible. We are lagging behind : G. will have a ship by ’63. We can’t get required experience w’out bldg. a ship. The first won’t be economic anyhow. Firms will welcome tenders but will expect promise to build.
M. A.E.A. were not in favour of bldg. a ship. Tho’ if we do they favour B.W.R. choice.
Hail. I favour M/T. view (and A.E.A.). Balance of argument.
H.A. I think so, too. Reserve posn. on recovering contribn. to tenderers by royalties.
R.M. There is a 3rd type of re-actor, by Genl. Electric – gas cooled.
E.M. I will consider this, on receipt of facts from B/Trade.
Agreed – proceed as proposed by M/T. [Exit C.
6. Road Traffic.
E.M. Urgent need is to get on with Bill during recess. Plan is to have over-riding powers over Met. Boros., tho’ we wd. work thro’ them.
Importance of enforcement. Pink Zone &amp; towing away are a bluff.
Public are ready to see drastic action &amp; to support it.
Form of Bill : wd. prefer to specify powers in such a way that they cd. be applied thereafter to other areas.
H.A. No objn. to prepn. of Bill – so long as my posn. on paras. 3(a) and 5 is reserved for detailed discussion.
H.B. Ready to help. Suggest early discn. with l.a.’s before final decisions taken. Their co-opn. may be available. Avoid any impn. of pre-judging findings of R. Commn. on Greater Ldn. (I will speak to Herbert.) London Govt. legn. is expected in 1961/62 session.
E.M. Propose to include traffic wardens &amp; ticket system in my Bill.
E.H. On form of legn., avoid appearance of emergency powers. Shd. not policy proposals come before H.A. Cttee.?
P.M. Cd. we not have Bill plus explanatory memorandum &amp; get it either to H.A. Cttee. or Cabinet.
Agreed : start work on Bill : simultaneously – prepare memo. on more diff.
pts. of policy for HA Cttee. or Cabinet.</content>
