  <content>C.C. 39(59). 7th July, 1959.
1. Commercial Policy : E.T. Association. [Enter E.H.
R.M. Saw Danes, with J.H., y’day : &amp; am seeing them again to-day. The most diff. country because nearer the Six &amp; also agric. Cab. agreed tht. we shd. make concessions to get them in to Stockholm Group. Public opinion, farmers &amp; Oppn. Parties in D. are all at best lukewarm : but Govt. are still interested to join the 7.
Y’day they said they definitely want to join. A considerable advance. They want to make a deal now. In eggs, butter &amp; cheese they make the point tht. we are offering them v. little. They have lost traditional market in eggs in U.K. They must be able to convince their public they have some prospect. Want they want, in addn., is abolition of tariff on luncheon-meat : immediate abolition of tariff on bacon : and statement wh. gives them prospect of continuing market in U.K. We cd. clinch an agreement on that basis.
P.M. Are we to make any advance on document drawn up on Friday.
J.H. i) Add some general principles now, in advance of Stockholm.
I see no great danger in that. Limited to References to opportunities for D.
to expand their market.
ii) Bacon tariff. We have come down from 10 yrs. to 5. We mght come
down to 3 years. I wdn’t go further than that.
iii) We cd. make the concession on luncheon meat.
This wd. add up to a reasonable offer, wh. we cd. defend to the rest of the 7.
P.M. Issues narrow down to rate of redn. of tariff on bacon and cancellation of tariff on luncheon meat.
R.A.B. Bacon. Quicker redn. wd. not harm pig producers, but wd. affect curers. I wd. sooner not go beyond 4 years. (Viz., 25% p.a.)
R.M. Danes wd. not be satisfied with that. They want immediate removal.
H.A. V. considerable prize to get Danes in. To do so, we shall have to offer more than aboln. in 4 yrs. Manageable to offer 3 years – either in equal thirds : or one redn., 5% now and the other 5% at end of period. We can’t expect them to make a deal for less.
R.A.B. But industry has 10 yrs. in wh. to accommodate themselves to tariff abolition.
J.H. I wd. offer 3 years.
R.M. So wd. I – with H.A.’s alternatives on methods.
D.E. Worth the row to get the agreement with Danes.
Agreed : offer 3 years on alternative bases suggested.
E.H. Warning : this will be a shock to our agricultural Members.
Luncheon Meat. Import of £5 M. at 10% tariff.
H.A. This is a small, and painless, concession.
J.H. Better to concentrate on pigs.
P.M. Why not offer same arrangement as for bacon. Then justify it as consequential on the bacon concession. General Declaration. While we can’t give any undertakg. re
R.M. future price reviews, or reduce our oblign. to own producers, we don’t intend to use subsidies for the purpose of driving Danes out of their market in U.K. outcome of
J.H. No objn. to this. But it is the card we shall have to play in Stockholm talks. Do we weaken our bargaining posn. there by giving it to the Danes now.
R.M. They want it v. much – for they are getting v. little else.
P.M. Do we present it as special treatment for Danes or as somethg. we can give to anyone because means nothing. [Exit R.A.B.
Ch.H. Prefer 1st. line. Insert in decln. some words pointing to special position of Denmark as an agricultural country. And divide up sentences. Agreed
[Exit R.M., J.H. : As consequential, we must liberalise imports of bacon from Canada.
2. Parliament.
E.H. Business for next week.
3. Shipping Industry: Cunard Liners. [Enter Selkirk.
H.W. Chairman of Cunard is diff. to handle, has upset the industry, and can’t be trusted to handle this tactfully.
The Company’s reply is not a good document.
We shd. protect ourselves by seeking independent advice. Wd. help to get industry happy : wd. help on when ship shd. be built etc., And wd. give us time.
P.M. Who?
H.W. E.g. Heyworth : Sir John Hobhouse : lawyer or ch. accountant e.g. S. Brown.
P.M. Must know when it will report &amp; have some idea what it will say. If they are to report in favour, early report wd. be useful.
M. Cd. we take decn. in principle and ask them to consider size, place of bldg etc.,
I.M. I wd. prefer Govt. to decide in favour, and in favour of Clyde.
H.W. Their best offer (Cunard) will make it appear a strong Govt. subsidy. And we shd. still be lobbied for bldg. elsewhere than on Clyde.
x| Prs. I cd. play it out until after end/July.
H.A. I wd. prefer x/.
P.M. Wd. like announcemt. at end/session indicatg. we won’t abandon N. Atlantic
y| service : but size of ship, financial arrangements etc., present large problems
&amp; on these we intend to seek advice of a Cttee. of Three.
Agreed : Adjourn discn. – M/T. to consider y/.
I.M. Believe some factors – e.g. Govt. finance – is a matter for Govt.
H.B. Cttee. can clarify issues for Govt.
P.M. M/T. to consult Ty. M/Power M/Labour.etc., on y/ &amp; produce draft statement.
[Exit H.W., Selk.
5. Defence: Move of U.S. Squadrons to U.K.
S.Ll. Saceur’s plan for redeployment. Will cost U.S. $40 m. – and much of this and m’tenance costs will be to our economic benefit.
Recommend acceptance. To do otherwise wd. be blow to N.A.T.O.
x| The existg. agreements on use (of aircraft with nuclear capability)will apply to these – tho’ under Saceur control.
D.S. Announcement will be made from N.A. Council. We shd. make reference to it in H/C. and add explanation of x/. [Exit H.B., D.E.
P.M. Agree – parallel statement to Press from M/Defence simultaneously.
G.W. Hope we can discuss with U.S. Air Force.
D.S. Not before announcement.
H. Believe some Canadian squadrons are affected. [Exit G.W.
6. Government Expenditure.
H.A. A correction on teachers’ salaries – shd. be £10 M.
D.S. There is, in def. exp’re, £50 M. wh. is on civil account.
Adjourned – for a later Cabinet.
7. Industrial Dispute: Printing Trade.
I.M. National newspp. Reprieve until Sat., if Unions will allow use of 14 tons? of ink. They are not parties to dispute &amp; I can’t refrain from seeking armistice – tho’ some wd. like to see national newspp. stopped – as a lever on main strike.
On main strike I’m trying to promote settlement, not buy it.
Presentational difficulties may therefore grow. [Re-enter R.A.B.
R.A.B. Debate in H/C. y’day went well. Newspp. will increase pressure for a settlement (high price).
P.M. Earnings – £25-30 p.wk. in newspp. offices. Cd. this be brought out. Wd. alienate sympathies of other Unions.
I.M. They aren’t on strike.
P.M. Cd. we not release informn. re earnings on provincial newspp.
I.M. Employers are prepd. to pay more in return for somethg. on restrictive practices.
Hail. Issues underlying dispute have not bn. brght out by Press – public haven’t therefore taken sides.</content>
