  <content>C.C. 35(59). 15th June, 1959.
1. Mr Menzies. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Precedent. Take advantage of him being here. No domestic business. Admiration for M.’s achievement. Welcome.
2. Berlin.
S.Ll. In 5 wks. no success. Wider discns. in 1st. 2 wks : no debate : no prospect of any agreement – at least before a soln. of Berlin.
Possibility of composite agreement on Berlin – at one time thought possible.
Atmosphere : at first was assumed we were ready to sell the pass. From Dulles’ death, others have come round to large extent &amp; Alliance is now pretty firm. But Germans are still v. suspicious of our policy.
Pen picture of personalities.
Gromyko’s public presentn. on Friday of his latest proposals. I don’t like paper presentation of W. position. Have prepared a more flexible version. Have also sought to discover wtr R. intend to provoke a break-down.
M’while Thompson plan. Geneva Tels. 228 and 229. Described it. This is being revised by W. officials.
Next steps. How long shd. we continue? Shd. we draw out discussions, or introduce some new theme? Back Thompson plan if it proves a runner. But confine discn. to Berlin : don’t introduce new subjects. Work for some agreement on Berlin : try to avoid b’down. Possibly aim to wind up at end of this week. U.S. prob. won’t favour a break – tho’ French &amp; G. may.
Best outcome = some agreement on Berlin for submission to Summit, which wd. confirm that &amp; lay down procedures for discussion of other subjects by F. Ministers.
P.M. Cabinet advice needed –
a) Any purpose in moving to a new subject?
b) If we confine it to Berlin, how conduct next week’s discussion? I’m against long adjournment : for disagreement on juridical ques won’t be understood by public opinion &amp; discussion will erode W. position. Adjournment sine die wd. be better because leaves open other means of seeking settlement.
Thompson plan is improvement. I wd. still prefer preamble acknowledging opposing juridical views &amp; confine substance to practical arrangements.
S.Ll. A rational version of original W. paper wd. be more acceptable to R. than the Thompson plan.
D.S. Thompson plan wd. remove Berlin from Summit agenda – not good.
H. Preamble idea : cdn’t we state tht. each side is in each part of Berlin by will of inhabitants.
S.Ll. R. power to bring pressure on W. Berlin. Unsafe therefore to base our position on their consent.
D.E. Not sure R. want a Summit Mtg. now – hence proposal for year’s delay.
S.Ll. Doubt that. The year was designed to press 2 Germanies to come together.
H.W. Br. public wd. be content to leave juridical posn. on one side, if we cd. get a practical plan.
S.Ll. Agree : but Allies won’t link it. U.S. and Fr. won’t abandon (or even change) our occupn. rights.
S.Ll. Cd. alternatives be submitted to a Summit? K. will want something to to at a Summit.
R.G.M. Geneva. Hasn’t failed entirely. W. case is being understood, slowly, by uncommitted countries – its disinterested fairness. Attitude of S.Ll. and Herter will yield dividend.
Juridical argument is barren : no rapprochement &amp; no Judge to settle it. Dangerous to base our posn. on consent of inhabitants – for that cd. disappear overnight. Better to state opposing views, with reasons.
Work therefore for practical arrangemts. which will last for some time.
Don’t embark on other topics. Wd. enhance impn. of futility.
Summit Mtg. Hope it will be at our (W.) initiative, not at Mr.K.’s. Let us keep it, if we can.
R.A.B. Effect on U.K. political situation. Do we want Summit before Election, or ask for mandate for one after it. The first isn’t so advantageous if Summit is unlikely to be successful. Can we instead exploit the danger of the internatl. situation? Actually, we cd. play it either way electorally.
R. are takg. into a/c. the no. of disagreeable old men – Adenauer. Also Ike’s departure. They may prefer now to have a later Summit.
Break this off in a week. Don’t have 2 month adjournment. Don’t keep it in F.M. Mtg. Refer to Govts or some other body.
K. Para. 14 of memo. See notes on memo. Views.
D.S. Must have early Summit. We shd. keep intiative, not be summoned by Mr.K. Favour submission of some version of Thompson plan. Put it as advance twds. R. view &amp; seek R. comments. Then both cd. be submitted to a Summit, and justified as a narrowg. of the gap.
P.M. Continue G. discns. on a practical plan for Berlin.
Keep it in mind there may be a break &amp; tht. our plan must therefore be defensible to p. opinion in the West.
Carry on for 7-10 days, so we may concert later steps.
If there is a break : R. may make their Treaty with DDR. or
If U.S. can be persuaded to follow D.S. line, we can expect to plan for a Summit Mtg. If U.S. repves. aren’t ready to regard that as progress, we must have a chance to consider what action U.K. Govt. can take. Need time for that. may demand Summit at given date. Dilemma for us.</content>
