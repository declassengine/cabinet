  <content>C.C. 20 (59). 25th March, 1959
1. Federation of Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland. [Enter E.H.
No note taken.
2. P.M.’s Visit to Ottawa &amp; Washington.
S.Ll. Canadians supported our approach &amp; wished us luck.
Washington. First visit to Dulles : v. ill and rigid in his views on Berlin : stand firm &amp; R. will give way.
Camp David. Eis. more flexible. Reconciled to Summit Mtg., tho’ not prepared to commit himself now. Agreement on formula.
On Substance : Berlin : Eis. more open-minded than his advisers. Sees you can’t hold p. opinion on a negative proposition. If he remains in control, we may get support for a more constructive approach. All others – and Fr. and G. – will dislike new agreement.
Limitation of forces : to be studied. Eis. not against.
Tests. Pentagon &amp; A.E.C. want to go on with undergrnd. tests. Eis. sees advantage of wider agreement, incldg. inspc., and wd. take risks to get it.
M/East. Broad community of approach. Agreed on Qassim : not wholly lost. They don’t trust Nasser, but want to convince him that he need not give up hope of help from West. Accepted need for common line on Kuwait &amp; Gulf.
F/East. Chiang is not reducing strength on K. &amp; M. U.S. see military disadvantages, but disposed to accept Chiang’s prestige argument.
Trade. Eis. agreed with us in principle, but argued that if he were more liberal Congress wd. insist on somethg. worse.
Discussion with Anderson on I.D.A. Reduced size of fund – 1 billion (vice 2) dollars.
They were glad to see us. Atmosphere friendly &amp; talks v. frank. We also were able to make more contacts than usual with Congress.
P.M. Was unhappy at outset. Still concerned at situation in U.S. – relations between Executive &amp; Legislature. For 6 out of 8 years this President will have a hostile Congress. They are v. powerful – both on foreign &amp; economic policy. And true representatives of their constituencies – log-rolling &amp; pressure groups.
Dulles – no one can forecast his future. Here he wd. resign.
Herter – v. nice man: easier to handle.
Procedure : read &amp; explained crucial passage in draft reply to Soviet note. Broadly, we have got our way – in substance, if not in terms.
Substance : too much emphasis on forms and words. But they have moved quite a bit.
Civil side of Pentagon are now hoping for a political solution. Recognise that mil. solution is not practicable w’out use of nuclear.
H.A. Earliest date of Summit?
P.M. End July or early August.
S.Ll. Not sure we can get agreed posn. between 3 W. Powers. Hope we may get support for more constructive approach at N.A.T.O. Mtg – where we shall have Scandinavians &amp; Canadians &amp; Spaak in favour of our approach.
* Reply to note has bn. approved by N.A.T.O. &amp; will be published at 2. p.m. Thursday.
P.M. On the 2 Fr. hypothesis, we haven’t yet made much impact on U.S. First : re-affirm status quo with such modificns. as are required by R. transfer of their obligations to D.D.R.
Second (wh. we prefer) : new agreement, with internl. guarantees.
[I’m not sure tht. R. will concede 1st. We mght argue for 2nd. &amp; fall back on first.]
3.
Iraq.
D.S. Recommend we now w’draw fr, Habbaniyah.
S.Ll. No basis now for remaining.
P.M. I agree.
4. Egypt. Foreign Compensation Commission. [Enter Att.G.
H.A. a) Ottoman Bank. Not a Br. company, tho’ it holds its annual mtgs here, has Br. Chairman &amp; large Br. shareholding. But throughout discussions negotiators treated it as ranking for compensation. Can’t now do other w’out charge of breach/faith. Alternatives : include it in Order eo nomine, or include some general words covering claimants in like case. Ty. &amp; Att.G. prefer former course. We know of no other claimants of this kind : if they materialise we can amend Order.
b) Br. subjects who have lost Br. naty. or transferred rights to aliens since ’56. Prefer to leave them out – &amp; consider on merits later.
Att.G. Diff. Order to draft. If we widen it, we shall arouse suspicions – incldg Br. claimants who wd. expect their share to be reduced pro tanto.
I support course recommended by H.A. on (a).
On (b) have come round to the view tht. we shd. exclude all f. claimants. &amp; promise to consider hard cases (if any appear) on their merits.
K. I agree.
S.Ll. So do I.
5.
Cabinet Business.
P.M. Budget Cab. on 6/4 p.m. If earlier Cab. needed, expect it to be Thurs. or Friday.</content>
