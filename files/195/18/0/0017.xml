  <content>C.C. 24 (59). 20th April, 1959
1. Supply of Arms : Iraq. [Enter E.H., Alport.
S.Ll. Advantage : may hold Army twds West., &amp; may help over I.P.C. Monckton recommends it. Turks, Jordan, Iran support : U.S., Pak., Canada are ready to acquiesce. H.M. Ambassador commends it, not because of Qassim, but because large elements in Iraq Army &amp; Govt. which are non-Communist&amp; wd. be strengthened by this sale.
We cd. face row at home, prs. Main danger is a row with Egypt.
Tanks – delivery starting Aug. 1960 : Canberras – twds end of ’60. (Guns cd. be delivered earlier.) We cd. therefore hold up or cancel if Iraq went Communist m’while.
Nasser seems pathologically suspicious of U.K. Will certainly regard such action as anti-Nasser rather than pro-Communist. But will this make any difference to his
We are supplying tanks to Israel. First instalment (16) to go soon : &amp; prob. can’t be kept secret. action?
E. financial settlement : E. are makg. some [satisf.] progress in carrying it out. Tho’ there are still important steps they haven’t yet taken. No abnormal drawings on balances.
P.M. Shd. be arranged with B/E. tht. they will consult Ty. before authorising any v. large w’drawals. We can’t risk sitn. in wh. they don’t carry out their side of the bargain and
How did the oil mtg go? get the money.
M. No conclns. yet. Not going too badly.
S.Ll. In Iraq govt. is being conducted by M/Defence – and it is they who wd. be influenced favourably by promise to supply arms.
P.M. Our formula wd. be : we wd. be ready to accept orders for x &amp; y, with delivery dates as shown subject to financial arrangemts.
Risk = he will make diffies. over financial settlement.
R.A.B. Welcome split among Arabs (E. and Iraq) : that suits us – the old historical situation.
Late deliveries are a help.
On balance I wd. favour sympathetic approach i.e. promise to supply. We shall be no better off with N. than we wd. be otherwise.
H.A. On balance I agree. Much financially at stake in both countries : for Iraq also has large sterling balances.
R.M. Which has greater influence in Arab World – N. or Q.?
S.Ll. Unpopular with many Govts. – tho’ popular in Gulf.
A.L.B. Influenced by attitude of T. &amp; Iran, who have most to lose if the arms are put to bad use. On balance, I favour doing it.
I.M. Agree with L.P.S.
M. So do I : no objn. on part of Allies.
D.E. Kubba, M/Trade is plainly Communist : urging importers to buy nothing from West which can be got from Soviet bloc. Decn won’t therefore be popular with industry here.
R.M. Cd. we make condns. – e.g. re ban of supply from I.C.I.
S.Ll. Cd. refer to these points when informg. Q. He wdn’t accept “strings.”
Ch. H Do it, if satisfied tht. E. will in any event make diffies. over settlement on finance.
S.Ll. Don’t believe N. will expect us to act differently.
P.M. Need we announce?
S.Ll. Can’t avoid knowledge of Canberras.
P.M. Doubt if N. wd. denounce f. agreemt. But he mght delay, &amp; thus revive pressure from claimants here.
S.Ll. Mght ask U.S. &amp; Canada to try to convince N. we aren’t seeking to undermine him – or working with Q. against him.
G.Ll. If we cd. avoid big publicity, N. less likely to re-act unfavourably.
P.M. Form of decn. Authorise H.M. Amb. to inform Q. we are anxious to remain friends : arms (Army &amp; R.A.F.) supplied in past, as consequence of back history. Wd. in principle be ready to supply fr stocks available. Other items wd. take longer to deliver. Give dates. In accordce. with principle above, we wd. raise no objecns. – give facilities – subject to financial arrangemts. On his side : we want to see trade contd. mention his restrictive acts e.g. on contractors. : on that understandg. ready to authorise negotns. with suppliers of U.K. arms.
Await his response before making any public announcement.
Alport. View of Canada : N. shd. be informed in advance.
S.Ll. We wd. tell them in advance of delivery : but not earlier – in context of explann. of general attitude to Iraq.
[Exit A.L.B.
