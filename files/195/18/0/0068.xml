  <content>C.C. 29(60). 6th May, 1960.
1. Law of the Sea. [Enter C., Att.G., M.R.
P.M. Canadians are to confer to-day.
J.H. Two Ministerial mtgs. Can we rescue something from Geneva – and get law vice
I therefore favour i) pressing for multilateral convention ii) fishing agreement for N. Atlantic – region. chaos. Ques : how many wd. join. C., save India : some L. Americans and Asians. Simultaneously, diff. ques in reln. to Iceland &amp; fishing in N. Atlantic. Fishermen are trying to trap R.N. into supporting them w’in the 12 miles. Norway also mght be restrained from declaring 12 mile limit. Settlement with I. cd. more easily be reached w’in framework of a Regional agreement.
Fishing industry have promised to meet me next Thursday.
P.M. Att.G. agrees with proposal for Regional agreement. Genl. support for that.
Att.G. Convention. We may weaken effect of 54 vote. Better stand on Geneva results. Quite a few who voted for that resoln. wd. not sign Convention. That wd. mean that these were seen to resile : &amp; this wd. encourage 12-milers. They might get 40 or so to sign a 12-mile convention. That wd. nullify the success at Geneva. We can nothg. by it wh. cd. not be gained thro’ regional fishery discns. Regional approach mght give 12 m. fishing for Canada &amp; Norway – &amp; boxes elsewhere.
Mistake to try both at once – one wd. embarrass the other. Better tht. fishing discns. shd. concentrate on fish, w’out distraction of t. limits.
K. True we have 54 us now. But rapid defection is likely if nothing is done. And at Ct., value of the vote wd. be lessened if several of them went over to 12 miles. This is a real danger : value of vote being dissipated.
Recommend therefore we at once explore likelihood of getting support for convention.
What convention wd. we favour? (C.) Three condns. i) not less than 40, ii) well distributed iii) shd. include critical areas.
Effect on concentratg. on fishing &amp; ignoring t. sea. Att.G. prefers that. Offls. however think no action on t. sea wd. imply tht. we attach less importance to width of t sea &amp; this wd. encourage 12-milers.
Majority of Cttee. therefore favoured action twds. convention on 3 condns. above.
S.Ll. Talks with I. &amp; N. at Istamboul. We must take immediate action re N. Atlantic. N. will press for 12 m. – opinion pushing Govt.
Remainder not heard
[Exit C., Att.G.
2. Mtg. of Commonwealth P.M.’s.
H. S.A. argue tht. racial policy is internal &amp; therefore out of order. New Doms. because of multi-racial character of C. feel mtg. must deal with issue in some
way. Got over 1st. hurdle on 1st. day – agreement on private informal discns. Louw agreed to give informn. &amp; answer ques. This mght have held posn. to final communiqué. But Louw was intransigent in private talks : &amp; Tunku was resolved to play it up.
Y’day’s clash. Glossed over.
We now are likely to be urged to make some sort of decln. Positive : in favour of m. racial Comm : negative : deploring Union policy : or even a code of human rights. Must therefore weigh formulae. Also estimate L.’s re-action : he mght walk out. (Even so, doubt if V. wd. take Union out of C.)
Another hurdle. L.’s instrns. to raise republican issue. Affirmative answer wd. help V. in his referendum. Doubt if P.M.’s wd. do more than take note.
Most P.M.’s recognise damage to 9 m. Africans in S.A. if Union were expelled from C. But tempers are running v. high. L. is difficult.
May get thro’ if we can annex to communiqué some decln. on multi-racial nature of C. Even so, diffy. over republican issue.
K. Republican. Swart’s statement in ’55: not to be taken for granted : each appln. on merits. Cd. it be conveyed to L. tht. on this basis it shd. be left until results of referendums are known.
H. Avoid giving other Doms. ques : wd. you welcome them in advance.
They will quote Ceylon – tho’ there it was after an Election.
P.M. On republican issue, countries v. S.A. are on weak ground.
Opportunity for re-election is v. dangerous.
Assent gives V. a gt. pol. advantage.
What is our interest? To keep S.A. w’in Commonwealth – for their Govt. and policies may change – and large B. popn. and interests of Africans.
I.M. Unless we find formula on race relns., P.M.’s won’t look at resoln. on republic.
We want to keep S.A. in. V. wants resoln. on republic. Can we trade that v. m-racial resoln. on C.
H.A. Support that approach.
H. He won’t endorse a racial resoln. : he mght wear a separate &amp; simultaneous declaration.
P.M. Cd. we persuade L., in present temper, not to raise republican issue.
R.A.B. H/C. Oppn. want decln. of human rights. Can’t get that. Can we have a decln. which all save Louw will support?
D.E. Things are moving now in S.A. There may be change of policy.
P.M. Then we shd. let it move. Don’t be provocative.
3. Africa : Economic Aid.
H. Pol. advantages : for S.E.A. Col. Plan was relatively cheap for us. Cd. we at least examine it. But will there be enough support for it?
H.A. Dangers. If small, wd. be a flop. If large, &amp; Commonwealth venture, we shd be expected to do more than we can.
Shd. have to make it plain tht. we cd. do no more than programmed. What cd. we get from others – £5 M. over 5 yrs? Little reality in it then.
Most we cd. do wd. be to remit it for study to C. Cttee. – after soundings to see wtr A &amp; C. wd. give any
V. rash to blow it up big before it’s bn. examined. support.
H. Cd. we do better by raising it at Summit. We want much more money than we cd. find w’in Commonwealth.
H.A. Help to I &amp; P. mobilised thro’ Bank. Gap to be filled fr. overseas is “2.600 M over 5 yrs.
When cd. you get anything on this scale for Africa?
Better to go thro’ Bank.
Hail. Found it on wider basis – if you want to get more.
P.M. Steer C. contn. into men vice money?</content>
