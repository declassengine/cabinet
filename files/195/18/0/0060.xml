  <content>C.C. 19(60). 22nd March, 1960.
1. Foreign Affairs.
S.Ll. a) Israel
b) . Ben Gurion’s visit. Desire for modern defensive arms, to keep up with Nasser. Latter less likely to attack if he knows he will get a bloody nose.
Cyprus
c) . Another week’s discn. G. &amp; T. think mtg of F.M.’s wd. be premature : wiser to let C. talks go on. Must accept that view. Still diffies. betwn. G. &amp; T. Cypriots – over constitn. and over money.
Cento Mil. Cttee. mtg
d) . 3 Reg. members want a Command structure. This wd. be provocative to R. – if endorsed by Council just before Summit – so we may have to delay it.
Nuclear Tests. R. proposal, adopting our own suggn. of moratorium. U.S. agencies have bn. at odds over this. R. proposal involves admn. tht. control below threshold is impracticable : proposes joint research to improve it : and moratorium on tests below it m’while. V. small concession, for control machinery cdn’t become effective in less than 3 years. If we fail to get agreement at Geneva, and R. resume tests in atmosphere, we shall be blamed for their action. Must do all we can to persuade U.S. to accept R. proposal.
P.M. Gt. opportunity : we must not let it slip. his wd. be first step in controlled disarmament. If U.S. rejects this, we shd. have to take a different line in public. For it is known tht. we have ourselves favoured this v. solution.
General support for P.M.’s view.
R.M. e) U.S./German Talks
to U.S. Govt. . Bad sentence in communiqué. We propose to protest
H.B. Most unfortunate.
P.M. Stress, with them, its effects on Europe.
[Enter J.H.
2. Carlton House Terrace.
H.B. As in memo.
S.Ll. All in F.O. agreed that we don’t need to go to C. House Terrace. Wd. like definite plan for concentn. on one site (F.O. Whitehall) before 1968.
P.M. Then Crown Estate can develop, without interference with facades.
H. Wd. help if we cd. find home elsewhere for India Office library.
3. Parliament : Accommodation.
R.A.B. 1922 Cttee. : those who spoke favoured little change. Others may. But feeling v. bldg. in the courtyard. M/W. shd. soft-pedal in his speech on this bldg : stress rather the rebuildg. or re-arrangemt. of top corridor.
J.H. Impossible to discover what Tory Party really wants.
R.M. Tories value hugger-mugger condns. in which they live.
[Exit J.Hope.
4. Broadcasting.
Agreed : extend B.B.C. Charter to co-incide with expirn. of I.T.A.statute.
P.M.G. Cttee. of enquiry. a) is it needed? b) shd. we appoint it at once? Financial &amp; social ques involved are v. diff. politically. We need independent advice. On b) time-table is tight : we ought to start at once.
On composition : we must have a balanced body. Wd. like to add a housewife and a teenager.
R.A.B. Favour enquiry. B.B.C. and I.T.A. wd. accept it.
H.A. Wd. t. of r. cover profits of I.T. companies?
PMG. Yes.
I.M. Must we have M.P.’s – they are bound to take opposite views.
P.M. R. Commn.? Important enough.
E.H. Easier for us to set aside findings of a lower body.
P.M. Yes.
H.B. Appoint it quick – to avert pressures already bldg. up.
P.M. Someone much younger : Chairman &amp; members.
P.M. We must have a Cttee. Let’s have one large enough to enable us to pick &amp; choose among their recommns.
[Exit PMG.
