  <content>C.C. 44 (59).
21st July, 1959
1. Federation of Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland. [Enter O.G.
P.M. Saw Gaitskell y’day. His attitude was correct : but I don’t count on his support. He will begin by asking a no. of ques. He doesn’t think any local repves. shd. be included.
2. National Health Service. [Enter D.W-S., J.S.
Financial Structure.
R.A.B. Concluded we can’t adjust contns./grant/charges. Or abolish charges. We mght offer experiment on prescribing. Free drugs for private patients (£2M) shd. be w’held pro. tem.
D.W-S. Can’t reduce gross cost : longer people live, the more it costs.
Charges. Any move to increase contns. shd. be accompanied by abolition of charges – better tht. people shd. pay when well than when ill.
Voluntary limitn. of prescribing will be helpful experiment.
Need for more investment in hospital – wd. eventually reduce running cost.
J.M. BMA have urged p’mme of £750 M. on hospitals over 10 yrs.
Memo. approved.
Opticians’ Fees.
J.S. Charges were subject of investign. – wh. pointed to reduction of dispensing fee. H.A. agreed tht. this shd. not be reduced provided “hybrid” (c) was reduced. This package was accepted by Ministers &amp; by Whitley Council. a) cost us £½ M and b) £¼ M. Ty. are now being asked to spend £¼ M. for 600 opticians’ votes.
Ch.H. Full logical case for this. Mitigation : dispensing opticians are out-voted in their Union : and for them it is a straight cut in remuneration.
P’pone decision until H.A. returns.
[Exit D.W-S.
[Enter Alport.
3.
Agricultural Policy.
Pigs.
J.H. Danger to agreemt. with Danes is tht. our pig-keepers will panic and stop breeding. H.A.’s “provided no failure in confidence” – but this is whole problem.
P.M. We must say now tht. we won’t reduce price in next Review. But we needn’t ask for more breeding : viz., don’t say “we don’t want any decline in production.” Latter will re-act on Danes.
R.A.B. Constituencies are disturbed – think we are going back on farm policy. Cd. we at least say we want “to m’tain the herd”.
J.S. Stick to Maudling’s formula. Doesn’t matter much here : may make whole difference in Stockholm.
P.M. “I, as M/Ag., want to m’tain efficient pig prodn. As a Govt. we assure you tht. price will be m’tained at next Review.”
I.M. Dangerous distinction to draw.
R.A.B. Cd. we say : no reason to lose confidence. He wants m’tain pig prodn. on efficient basis. To encourage them, he can assure them re price in next review. Refer to earlier case of advance notice.
Alp. This mght be contravention of Anglo-Austr. or N/Z. Trade agreemnt.
P.M. No. This is not a change of policy. Wait until they raise it. Don’t warn A &amp; N.Z.
Tariffs.
J.H. Shall be asked about horticultural tariffs in debate. But don’t want to rush Cabinet. I cd. stall in this debate.
4.
Casement Diaries.
R.A.B. Diaries have bn. shown to Irish Ambassador.
Propose to put diaries in P.R.O. and allow public access, after appln. to H.O.
Otherwise mystery will continue.
P.M. Copyright will run – as protection v. publication.
Hail. Also law relating to obscenity.
R.A.B. Shall say : publication at own risk – because copyright.
K. Agree.
Alport. So do we.
Approved.
5.
Legislative Programme.
R.A.B. B.I. wd. be enough to start us off : and we cd. bring some up from B.2.
Bills which are lagging marked x. Hope these can be chased up.
D.S. International H.Q. &amp; Defence Organn. Hope it can be promoted from C. to B.2.
I.M. Payment of Wages by Cheque. Shd. be added &amp; put in B.
H.B. Charities (Rating) can go to bottom.
But Caravans must be promoted.
P.M. Get things ready, as possible : don’t argue about priorities.
6.
Parliament.
E.H. Hola, with other subjects, on Monday. (Incldg defence)
Devlin on Tuesd.
Wed : Transport (B.T.C.)
