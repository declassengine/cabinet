  <content>C.C. 24(60). 5th April, 1960.
1. Persian Gulf. [Enter M.R.
S.Ll. Similar concessions will need to be made to Abu Dabi, as to Kuwait. Must ensure tht. his local law is reputable. Shall play it slowly.
2. Cyprus. [Enter Perth.
S.Ll. Paras 1 &amp; 2 : we shd. give discretion to Amery.
But if M. doesn’t budge from 80 sq. miles, timing is more doubtful. No point then in J.A. staying in Cyprus – even if it means rowdy debate in H/C. : no objn. to debate if it isn’t in atmosphere of crisis or emergency – wh. wd. encourage Makarios. G. &amp; T. feel he shdn’t hang around in that event.
P.M. J.A. shd. say he had completed his task &amp; must return to report to Govt. i.e. move it to a higher plane.
S.Ll. But avoid language implying tht. he is coming to get more concessions fr. us.
He cd. say at once he is reporting : we cd. then settle form of words to explain his coming home &amp; he would not come until Friday.
3. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week. 14 – 26 April : Easter recess.
K. Friday 8/4 : 1st. resoln. is v. narrow &amp; won’t run for long. This lets in Stonehouse motion on S. Africa. Also 1st. motion might be w’drawn.
M.R. In the latter event Tory back-benchers must move amendment &amp; talk it out.
H. Can make a statement to-day about B. subjects affected by disorders. Treatment of persons arrested etc.,
We may get into diffies. over requests to return people who have taken refuge in H.C. territories.
R.A.B. H.G. is pressing for assurance we won’t send such people back.
P.M. Beware of danger of sharpening S.A. pressure to absorb the territories.
H. Have warned S. Afr. Govt we must avoid a row over individuals.
P.M. K. to look into posn. under F. Offenders Act. Appeal to Privy Council etc.,
4. Somaliland.
P. As in memo. Union with Somalia is consistent with our declared policy, but ought not to move too fast. On other hand, if we appear to drag our feet, there may be disorder we can’t control.
We shd. make it plain i) independence only for that purpose ii) Comm. membership not for U.K. alone iii)
S.Ll. Say only “prepare for independence. Union with Somalia wd. be for them to discuss.” Para. 5 formula will get us into trouble with Ethiopia : and crisis over grazing-rights will be prejudiced.
K. But without a soothing statement there will be riots : and we can’t bring troops into Africa at this stage.
Surely diffies. in para. 7 will in practice preclude union on 1/7.
P.M. Don’t prevent union : but don’t encourage it.
H. The Somalia motion was wider than B. Somaliland. V. explosive. This is result of not having p’mme &amp; sticking to it.
Can’t give independence “for this purpose only.”
If, united with Somalia, they asked for Comm. membership &amp; got it, we mght have C. country at was with Ethiopia &amp; subverting Kenya.
P.M. Accept in principle : try to work for joint Cttee. of 2 countries to discuss unofficially the practical diffies. of union.
Recognise spirit of resoln. : doubt practical possibility of union by 1/7 : but
x| offer immediately to facilitate unofficial discns. between the two.
H. They will shirk practical diffies., and campaign instead for a Greater Somalia.
S.Ll. In honour bound to Ethiopia not to do x/ before B. Somaliland is independent.
K. Those E. anxieties cd. be met by proposed answers to P.Q.’s.
P.M. Prs. Govr. shd. do no more than recognise strength of feeling behind the motion. [Exit R.M.
R.A.B. Cdn’t agree to transfer of Somali Scouts. Don’t give way to a single debate.
P. S. Scouts : plan was to transfer by end/1960.
H.W. As in Aden.
P. &amp; Profumo to work on draft, in light of discussion, and submit to P.M.
for approval.
[Exit P.
5. Imports of Pigmeat.
G. Para 13(b). M/Ag. withdraw suggn. for 1961 and later years. We can’t go beyond 13(a).
P.M. Can we have picture of supply &amp; demand in 1960?
G. V. diff. Denmark looks as tho’ it will send a great deal. Holland we don’t know. Home prodn. will be low until end/year but will then revive.
R.W. V. deep feeling in Poland – at heart of Anglo-Polish relns. Unless they can sell more bacon to us, they will turn to G. for manufactures. Gt. disappointment if we can’t return to last year’s quota. One of the friendliest of satellites : we shd. be slow to rebuff them.
S.Ll. We have harmed our relns. with P. &amp; our exports on hypothesis which was not realised. Strong support for restoring full quota 48.000 t.
Economic and pol. considns. co-incide.
H. Then we must give Canada pigmeat (25.000 t) vice bacon.
G. We had assumed there wd. be Canadian pigmeat for curing into bacon here. Price was too high. Quota is, however, available &amp; imports cd. still arrive. The other agric. reason was Danish agreement : and now there is talk of Finnish bacon.
M. We must look beyond ’60 if we are to export capital goods to Poland.
D.E. We shd. be giving the exports to Poland, paid for by Exchequer grants on pigs here.
Demand is inelastic. Home prodn. will rise because of price incentive : Danish bacon is bound to come uncontrolled : must give something to Canada. Poles, given a quota, will fill it : and domestic price will be forced down – with result that Ty. will have to pay £20 M. on guaranteed price. And annoy B. farmers because will reveal their vulnerable posn.
H.A. Support much of that argument. Offer 13(a) : &amp; begin early to negotiate with Poles on future. Let Canadian objns. develop.
R.A.B. Go no further than 13(a) pro tem. J.H. agrees with that. Agreed
consider 1961 before any announcement. : support 13(a) solution</content>
