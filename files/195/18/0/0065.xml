  <content>C.C. 26 (60). 13th April, 1960
1. Nuclear Weapons. [Enter Profumo, M.R.
P.M. Decn. of Def. Cttee. on Blue Streak – prefer to rely on mobile response. Consultn. with Menzies, who has accepted need for decision. Premature disclosure in Press is unfortunate – tho’ secret kept until actual day of official announcemt. Financial savings during early years.
Possible use as launcher for space research : will be investigated in detail.
Approved.
2.
Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for week after Recess.
3. Economic Situation. [Enter Erroll, Godber, Perth
H.A. Introduced both papers – linked C.60 and 61.
F.Erroll. Short-term prospects for exports : no indication yet of any falling-off, but some hope that imports may begin to drop.
D.E. Rate of E.C.D.G. credits? Is it increasing? If so, it represents forward support of b/payments.
F.E. Rising : 2% a year (?).
R.A.B. Banks may have acted, on Budget warning, on redn. of home consumption. How does this affect Ty. attitude?
H.A. Believe mild positive action will be needed – in a month or so. H.p. is still rising. No shock tactics required.
P. Warning re financial needs of Colonies.
[Enter C., Att.G.
4.
Law of the Sea.
K. What do we do if the 6 + phased-out 6 doesn’t get necessary majority? Choice may be between b’down of conference or 9 miles t. sea. Views of Dpts. on this. On balance 9 m. wd. be better – tho’ unpleasant. because of considns. in second part of para. 2. I endorse that.
Att.G. Consequences of b’down may be exaggerated. Not all States wd. declare 12 m. but Ct. mght uphold 6, in cases coming before them.
Cd. we get 6 + 6 – if 6 + 6 phased out fails. Why not try that?
J.M. V. diff. to defend this as a U.K. initiative
H.W. C.O.S. assume i) continuance of innocent passage ii) b’down means anarchy with most people going to 12. They wd. take a diff. view if Att.G.’s view of consequences of b’down is correct.
P.M. Order of preference : 6 + 6 phased out : 6 + 6 : 9.?
R.A.B. Danger of weakening argument fr. precedent in Int. Court.
Hail. Don’t vote for anything which will be lost.</content>
