  <content>C.C.2(59). 22nd January, 1959
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H, Alport
R.A.B. Business for next week.
2. Foreign Affairs.
a) Holland.
S.Ll. Visit of For. Minister to discuss Indonesia. They are upset over Gannets&amp; also K.L.M. decision. Caution in giving assurances re I. attack on W. New Guinea. U.S. have offered moral support &amp; logistic help. We shd. go at least as far. Austr. reluctant tht. any mil. support be offered. Wd. not make any assurance public.
P.M. No guarantees w’out Cab. approval of wording.
S.Ll. On supply of arms to Indonesia, there are torpedo-tubes to go into launches built in Germany. Shall suggest they raise ques in N.A.T.O. – for these orders were placed in G. We can’t easily refrain from exporting save in pursuance of a common line.
On K.L.M. decision, Ambassador has asked tht. For. Minister shd. have chance to make repns. We have said we won’t alter decision. He will ask us at least to delay until 15/2.
H.W. No objn. to p’ponement until 15/2, or a little later.
P.M. Go to 1/3. – final.
b) Egyptian Financial Agreement.
S.Ll. We can agree to say we understand dipl. relns. will be renewed in the near future. But we can’t give way on the agent who is to handle the compensation business : he must be allowed to operate from an early date with such immunities as he needs to do the job. An early date cd. be 2-3 wks – he cdn’t establish himself earlier. Mid. Feby. wd. suit us.
The 2 Br. prisoners. In ’57 E. repve. said that, as soon as this agreement was reached, they wd. be released. I shall remind E. Govt. of this, but don’t want to make it a condn. or say it publicily.
H.A. Black says it wd. have bn. better if agreemt. cd. be signed by someone senior than Crowe. – e.g. R. Makins.
S.Ll. Wd. prefer Rickett, returning. Wd. give us 24 hrs. in which to clear up details. We cd. say “hope to sign on Monday &amp; D.R. procdg. to Cairo for that purpose”. Agreed. D.R.
3. Air Journeys by Royal Family. [Enter G.W.
G.W. Increasg. length, speed &amp; frequency of flights make it imposs. to provide escorts as previously. Hence proposal for modification as in memo.
H.W. Agree. No other practicable solution. Will consider each on merits.
4. Armed Forces : Malcolm Clubs
G.W. In H/C. Adjournment Debate I said tht., if they cd. pay debts &amp; raise some working capital, we wd. re-consider. That is stiff. Alternatives :
i) give them 3 mos. in wh. to do this. But T. wdn’t accept that.
ii) if he says his financial posn. has improved, we cd. offer to discuss &amp; hold closure in abeyance.
iii) if he is intransigent, we shd. be seen to be climbing down. But we cd. promise to let them carry on &amp; review posn. in 3 mos.
P.M. Give him a longer time : he can’t raise the money in a short time. E.g. until end of ’59.
Precise formula to be agreed betwn. Ty. and Dundee
[Exit G.W.
5. Representation of Vatican in UK.
S.Ll. No approach fr. Vatican themselves. Fr. F.O. angle I wd. like to make a gesture. No real risk of developing into Nuncio, or doyen. Wd. help our relations with Vatican, which are good.
Ques is wtr it wd. revive controversy in U.K.
R.A.B. Caution. All invitations to attend Coronation were refused.
S.Ll. But they went to a place outside Abbey : and to banquets etc.,
R.A.B. He mustn’t become doyen because he wdn’t go into Protestant Church.
Strong anti-Catholic feeling in U.K. – don’t provoke it. Favour delay.
P.M. Illogical if we have Minister at Vatican. But qua polities, we wd. do better to give them somethg. on schools. Dangerous to do both at same time. Leave this for a year.
A.L.B. Don’t believe people in U.K. wd. care about it. But ready to wait if it wd. spoil opportunity for schools.
J.M. Nervous of anything wh. cd. arouse R/C. : Orange controversy. It is smouldering still.
H. Do the schools first.
Agreed : Wait.
6. Commercial Policy : Horticulture.
J.H. As in memo.
Add : there is econ. case. Profitability has declined since ’56. Value has dropped by £400.00 despite increased acreage. Costs up by 80% since ’54., as cpd. 23% in Holland. Rate of duty has been lower than on tomatoes. Effect on retail price about 4d. per doz on roses.
R.M. Advisory Cttee. found no economic case. Wd. earn us little credit with our producers. Wd. give us diffy. in Eur. negotiations, where we are pressing for tariff redns. generally. Don’t do it while we are hoping to pull some chestnuts out of that fire.
H.A. Support R.M. Diff. to ignore report of Adv. Cttee. On balance, this wd. do us more harm than good. Prefer to rely on grants scheme.
D.E. Tariff increase wd. require aff. resoln. Wd. be diff. to adduce any good reason : wd. have to admit pol. grounds : wd. be criticised.
Prefer to stand as long as we can on policy of opening markets.
We shd. have to go to GATT for waiver – we wd. get it, but not w’out argument.
Agreed : Announce rejection of other tariff applications, say that cut
flowers is still under considn., and announce grants scheme.
Resume discussion on cut flowers – via E.P.C. to Cabinet.
[Enter Molson
7. Chevening.
R.A.B. Historic : easy of access : pictures &amp; library.
Favour prepn. of legn.
Shd. we include, among possible uses, residence of member of R. Family.
P.M. Wd. help in reln. to statement re M. House.
R.A.B. Add to purposes general Govt. use as well as personal.</content>
