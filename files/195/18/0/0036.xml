  <content>C.C. 45 (59)
23rd July, 1959
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H., O.G.
R.A.B. Business for next week. 22nd. re-assemble. 27th. Opening of new session.
2. Podala : Arrest.
R.A.B. P.Q. in H/L. to-day. Read draft reply.
D.P.P. wants to give circs. of arrest in procdgs before Magistrate. Must also avoid any statement re
Procedgs. in court have bn. put back another week – Tues. week. his mental condn.
K. Circs : after 1st. charge on door, P. unlocked it : 2nd. time therefore door hit him in face.
R.A.B. Removed to hospital etc., Sorry we can’t say any more at this stage.
3. Commercial Policy.
H.A. E.T.A. went well. Atmosphere good. Concln reached on agriculture. Fish left in the air – &amp; everyone is content with that. Finland – will be kept in touch so tht. they can decide how close an association they want.
Will make statement after P.Q.’s to-day. Hailsham in H/Lds.
Institutions: launched idea of advisory Council.
4. N.H.S. Opticians’ Fees. [Enter D.W.S.
H.A. Thght Ministers had accepted package before Xmas last.
a. Increase in sight-testing fee was larger than merits warranted.
b. Dispensing fee was left unchanged tho’ on merits cd. have bn. reduced.
c. Hybrid dispensing fee was to be reduced to off-set a &amp; b.
Opticians collectively accepted this finding – tho’ those interested in c. were out-voted.
How can we justify re-opening package – making change wh. is not justified on merits. Politics : can we spend £¼ M. to buy off 600 men? Only 1/5th. of the money wd. go to this type of optician.
D.W-S. Opticians never accepted c. – tho’ I admit we have legal right to make the cut. 7.000 involved because all opticians wd. side with dispensing opticians.
These are small men, with little T.U. backing &amp; no rights of arbitration. The more awkward therefore to announce in just before recess.
I.M. Works out at almost £100 each. Cd. we not leave it over until later – apply in next years Estimates.
P.M. Pity all 3 decisions were not put into effect at once.
Why not pay increased fee only to men who do nothg. but dispense.
D.W-S. Same job.
P.M. But different people.
H.A. If deferred, as I.M. suggests, package will be completely bust.
H.A. Pretty much to pay £250.000 more annually for the sake of giving £50.000 to 600 people.
K. Why not p’pone decn. until end/year.
D.W.S. Package wd. be too far back.
P.M. Inform them tht. we reserve right to make decision later.
H.A. x| If Cab. accept in principle tht. this cut must be made later, e.g. in Jan., I am content tht. we shd. say nothing at present.
Agreed : as at x/.
[Exit D.W-S.
[Enter Bevins.
5. Employment: Distribution of Industry.
D.E. As in memo. Para. 17. (iv). One list, at discretion of Ministers, as proposed.
J.M. Two lists wd. help twds solution of special Scottish problems, and also prs. Wales.
I.M. Bad system : everything wd. go up to List A. – nothing cd. ever go down.
H.M. cf. priorities for production in war.
J.M. V. well. *But in that event we must seek some other remedy for Sc. areas.
*[Repeated on each item]
Para. 17 (vi)
H.A. Apprehensive – will grow. But see need for it &amp; accept it in principle. Percentage will need further thght. 40% wd. be too high : prs 25%.
P.M. Better prs. to have no formula : merely an upper limit e.g. of 33⅓%.
D.E. Grant shd. reflect diffces. of condns. betwn. one area &amp; another.
J.M. Need for flexibility.
I.M. Declare adminve. policy vice statutory formula.
Para. 17 (vii).
H.A. Investment allowances (tax) provide incentive – dangerous to add this. Also v. diff. to discriminate in respect of existg. factories : hard enough on new bldg.
H.W. Agree. V. diff. administratively – as betwn competing firms.
J.M. DATAC operates that way – &amp; hasn’t caused much trouble.
H.A. May be v.small dividend in terms of emplt.
M. Impossible to administer. What if firm moves or sells?
D.E. 40 empty out of 300 Govt. factories. This wd. help to get tenants.
P.M. Wd. prefer to omit this &amp; have higher percentage on bldgs.
Para. 17 (xii)
D.E. Good to invite Parlt. to look at it again after 7 years.
Para. 17 (ii).
D.E. a) Don’t want to give right of appeal b) Ready, however, to give written reasons for refusal.
P.M. b) Wd. be dangerous.
I.M. Don’t put a. in at outset.
P.M. Nor b). Wait &amp; test feeling in H/C.
Agreed : as above. No statement for time being.
P.M. Effect on N.I.?
R.A.B. Reduces differential advantage which N.I. now has. They will ask for higher grants for them.
H.A. They are at present v. generous.
P.M. And what of similar problem in Scotland?
J.M. Shall discuss transport costs with Sc. Council for Industry.
H.W. My problems mght be brought into a/c – Sc. is not viable transport area.
Bev. H.B. wants to reserve his posn. re Development Fund etc.,
D.E. Depopulated areas are not in pari materia.
[Exit Bevins.
