W.M.(42)86th Meeting 6th July (Sic) 1942 

Foreign Affairs. 

A.E. b) Madagascar. Genl. there wants existg. pol.offr. to continue &amp; my man to serve under him. (Brig. Lush) P.M. approved (7/5) sending my man out. 

P.M. Settle this with S/S War – not for Cabinet (?). I will settle if you can’t agree. 

Czecho-slovakia. 

A.E. Won’t give Benes all he wants – he once resigned &amp; there isn’t therefore same continuity in his Govt. But it will clear the point about Munich. 

L.P.S. Para 7. What does decln. mean? 

A.E. Sudetens are takg. line they won’t go. I want to make it clear tht. they can’t rely on that – rather than other way round. 

P.M. Make it clear tht. it is populations not territory. 

S/S.Doms. Smuts prev. asked tht. Dom. P.M.s shd. be consulted before changes made. 

P.M. Necessary? 

S/Doms. Smuts felt strongly. 

Agreed in principle : AE. to talk to Benes on these lines : Doms. to be consulted &amp; then in a few days decln. can be made public. 

Treatment of War Criminals 

P.M. Idea of my paper – you don’t pass judgement but collect facts in authve. manner. Make a big show of it. Publish evce fr. time to time to hot up the fires of war. 

Fact-finding Commn. only. Flourish of trumpets. Washington will take initiative. 

Simon. Similar Cttee apptd. Sept. 1914 – Bryes. Pollock. H. A. L. Fisher. Harold Cox. Alfred Hopkinson. 

But contained no names of offenders. 

P.M. Contemplate tht. if Hitler falls into our hands we shall certainly put him to death. 

67 

Not a Sovereign who cd. be said to be in hands of Ministers, like Kaiser. 

This man is the mainspring of evil. Instrument – electric chair, for gangsters no doubt available on Lease Lend. 

A.E. “Takg. depps. &amp; interrogating eye-witnesses” ) need 

Names suggested ) revision 

L.P.S. They must be “official” body. Appted. by Govt. 

P.M. Cttee to work out details ) – Ld. Chancellor : L.P.S. : F.O. A.G. 

of both W.P. Papers. ) M/Information. 

A.V.A. Dpts. with minor points can send them to the Cttee. 

Debate on Shipping Situation – deferred. 

Policy in Relation to Gandhi. 

L.S.A. G. will encourage resistance of peasants to troops – non-compliance with salt laws. 

P.M. Why go on with salt tax – v. little money in it. 

S/S. War 10% of pre-war revenue. 

P.M. But universal requirement – like taxing air. 

L.S.A. Congress now mtg. – by Mon. next we shall know. 

L.P.S. G. is on the retreat surely : latest speeches suggest v. little fire in him. 

L.S.A. Statement on 30/6 is fairly strong. 

P.M. Back to salt. Get rid of it. 

S/S War. What of Viceroy’s pref. for holding G. in India? 

Genl. feeling in favour of removing him from India. 

Otherwise – took note. 

Debate on Shipping Situation. 

L.P.S. Debate is on M/W.T. Vote : but they have said they want to talk abt. shipping. 

P.M. Our practice therefore in Secret. 

68 

Ch.Whip. Secr. Session gettg. unpopular. Two Priv. cases arisen fr. it. 

P.M. We can’t make our case in public. 

A.V.A. Policy of U.S. Navy Dpt – publish sinkings only where survivors land on Am soil and even these no mention of name or tonnage. Nothing therefore in claim tht. we are withholdg. while U.S. are publishing sinkings figures. 

Goebbels regularly publishes figures wh. are wrong but not deliberately inflated. 

We don’t want to give him the correct figures. 

Therefore dead against surrender to present claim in H/C. for publn. of losses. 

P.M. I suggested to President tht. it was inconvenient tht. they shd. publish more about losses than we do. Weekly publn. enables them to check their U-Boat reports. Bad also for public to take its pulse so frequently. 

I didn’t know how limited their publication was. I have asked Hopkins to let me know at once their final conclusion on my request. 

A.V.A. Press conference accepted my view of this. 

L.P.S. You won’t satisfy H/C unless you give them the figures in Secret Session at end. 

Ch.Whip Disagreed. 

M/L. Stand on our existing practice. 

L.P.S. But you can’t explain in public Session why U.S. figures are not satisfactory or full. 

Simon. Why can’t you explain publicly reasons v. publn. – as Churchill did in last war. 

M/Inf. Get back-benchers to read what U.S. papers say in ref. to Am. publn. &amp; its value. 

M/L. Don’t satisfy Shinwell &amp; the critics in H/C. at expense of confidence of the sailors. 

A.V.A. No kick in the last Debate. 

P.M. Our losses are not so v. bad. 

69 

Cranb. Addison wants Debate in H/Lords. x/ But he is concerned rather about B. building. 

S/Doms. H/C., doesn’t want a Secret Session. 

A.V.A. But you can’t deal with x/ in public session. 

P.M. Pity to have scare-mongering public debate, then answer it in Secret. – Agreed. 

S/Doms They want to talk of methods in ship bldg : possible need for further belt-tightening. 

P.M. My diffty. is tht. a really good answer (even on this) can’t be given in public. 

Leader shd. explain why we don’t intend to publish figures of losses. 

U.S. figures are on a difft. – basis: [but they are so designed tht. it doesn’t give infmn.to the enemy.] 

L.P.S. leave out [ ]: it will lead to argument. 

In spite of losses arrangements made with U.S. will enable war to be carried on, enough shipping. Want full debating power – can’t have it save in S.Sessions. 

If you want it therefore you must have it in Secret Sessions. 

Ch.Whip. We have had one Secret. We don’t want – nor do they – another. 

No need to have it in Secret if we aren’t going to give the figures. 

P.M. Then the Govt. can’t make its best case. 

K.W. They will walk out of a Secret Session. 

Cranb. H/Lords wouldn’t look at a S. Session. 

L.P.S. Trouble is uncertainty &amp; rumours built up on the Am figures. 

P.M. This can be met by our saying tht. we can see our way thro’ with U.S. assistance. 

If you want this fairly debated, it must be in Secret. 

L.P.S. Then if they raise losses we shall have to go into Secret – not because afraid of facts but because givg. informn. to enemy. 

70 

P.M. Wd. like to be able to take H/C. into confidence - &amp; give them all we can. 

Halifax. Hope care will be taken to avoid impression in U.S. that things are all right. 

L.P.S. I will tell them then tht. we can’t have losses discussed in public Session – we will discuss the other matters. 

Select Cttee on Exdpenditure – Enquiry into Tanks 

A.E. Precedent of Govt. 

S/S War G. was specl. case : other Genls have gone since.
