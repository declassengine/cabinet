W.M.(42)114th Meeting 20th August 1942.

I. Service Pay &amp; Allowances.

K.W. Debate line – people want to put views, let’em. Govt. W.Paper laid because matters wh. Govt think House shd. know. At end promise consider and announce decision later.

Conservatives – division of opinion likely.

S/Air. No comment.

L.P.S. V. dangerous document – will provoke demands for increase. Shows soldier much lower paid than industrial and p.u. workers.

K.W. You are comparing raw recruit with worker who has bn. in industry for long time.

L.P.S. Wrong to make the comparison at all. Confine to statement of Serviceman’s posn.

K.W. Face fact tht. comparison has bn. and will be made. This puts it in proper perspective.

L.P.S. The nearer the comparison the greater the danger. Close enough to provoke argument that the narrow gap shd. be closed. Put fwd. the facts, w’out comparison : and don’t therefore imply tht. comparison can properly be made. Only true comparison is what spending money has each left.

L.P. i.e. purpose of Paper is to show what wd. be comparative consolidated rate incldg. all emoluments if he were in civilian life. This is the equivalent of an income of x in civil life.

W.O. Necessary to bring out diffces. in system – e.g. differential pay of married man. “No comparison can fairly be made” vice “consider before comparison is made”.

Bruntisfield. 1st Lord shared view of L.P.S. Promise of W.Paper has excited expectations in Fleet : avoid therefore giving for material for argument.

K.W. Remarkable that, when last addition made to pay, Admy. said no occasion for it.

Then, a few weeks ago, Admy. asked for increases for offrs. and nothing for men.

Then they heard W.O. suggestg. another 1/= a day,

120

Then suddenly Admy. find Fleet v. much disturbed by announcement of W.Paper and advocate increased pay for ratings!

H.O. Repercussions on C.D. pay. We have rejected industrial analogy : and stuck to cash value of emoluments of married soldier + 1 child. If you prove your case for Army pay too well, C.D. will ask for more! Wd. like further chance to consider W.Paper.

S/Doms. W.Paper shd. not appear to make out a case. Factual &amp; objective.

Cranborne. Offr. class “specially favoured” in income tax.

K.W. Modify wording to avoid that.

L.P.S. Benefit of pensions not mentioned.

W.O. Other than regulars, don’t get any save disability.

L.P.S. Cheap goods at N.A.A.F.I.

L.P. Mention them as further indications tht. you can’t make precise calculations.

Halifax. Last para. to foot of p.3.

K.W. this has bn. done already.

K.W. Let me re-cast, in consultn. with H.O. and L.P.S. Service Ministers to see final version. Publish end of next week. Agreed.

W.O. Tactics in debate. Shd. we not make up our minds in advance.

K.W. Better, as they want to air views, to listen.

H.O. But Govt. is losing its initiative then. Promise to consider will surely mean concessions. Sooner you make up your mind and say so, the better.

S.Air. If we are going to make a concession, K.W.’s tactics are right. Otherwise, not.

Generally agreed – decide before Debate whtr. concession is to be made.

W.O. If you make it, do it on pay not by fiddling with allowances.

K.W. Then Cab.Cttee at once.

Ch.Whip. Agree tht. if we aren’t going to consider concession, better say so at once.

121

Bruntisfd. Our posn. has been changed because of rise in mercantile marine pay.

L.P.S. You will never get this right w’out having a wages policy – for rest of war.

H.O. Ques of policy on Service pay to go to L.P. Cttee? Agreed.

II Participation of de Gaulle in Preparations for Operations in France.

A.E. Troublesome - no ideal solution.

We are agreed a) F.F. to be assocd. in adminn. in Madagascar.

b) F.F. not to be used at all in Torch.

Sorry they know so much about it. Heard from Bullitt

and ques fr. Phillips (U.S. Embassy).

France itself: The more you interest de G. in this, the easier to keep him out of Torch. I therefore wd. recommend fullest practicable use of him in round-up and SOE Met. France – as a way of keeping him out of Torch.

I wdn’t have as much hope as C.O.S. of Vichy Army.

C.O.S. W.P. 349. para 2. Re-considered.

(1) true of Army: but now agree to return of Air Force.

(2) C.I.G.S. has talked to de G. about co-ordinn. of sabotage etc. with plans: expld. tht. S.O.E. is general staff for this. We wd. like S.O.E. to go on co-ordinatg. &amp; be the link with us.

Selbourne. de G. has no secret organisn. in France. Various units workg. on their own use him as symbol. We will go on co-operatg. with him. But don’t want to hand this over to him in France because he has no organisation there.

S/Doms. Long-term position.

A.E. Don’t know wht. de G’s. l.term posn. will be after Torch.

L.P.S. Diffies. with French populn. if 2 diff organisns. workg. in parallel w’out co-ordination.

Selborne. Many independent groups wh. come to life independently – &amp; use de G. only as symbol.

Pursue suggn. of working Cttee to key in with de G.

122

L.P.S. Tho’ not now, de G. will soon be working a separate organisation of his own.

S. Germans can break organn. in France much more easily than in Norway.

A.E. Consider closer co-ordination – S.O.E. being channel for contact with C.O.S.

S. We must maintain our non de G. contacts – wh. he wants us to repudiate.

C.O.S. (4) in para 2. Still feel v. dangerous to let F.F. HQ to know plans. But no objn. to de G. being assocd. with plans for administration in France.

W.O. U.S. if they command shd. be responsible for adminn. And the U.S. repve. on x/ our Cttee takes view tht. de G. shd. not be in.

A.E. Tendency for U.S. politicians is to encourage de G. overmuch.

L.P. x/ is an impossible view.

S. We expect bitter civil strife in France when Boche goes. Our contacts are with the people who have bn. sitting on the fence.

A.E. Surely you cd. keep yr. Vichy contacts quite separate from yr. organisation in occupied France.

W.O. On (4) dilemma. In military occupied territory source of authy. is military commander, whose object will be to restore civil Govt. In France, there is no constituted Govt. to restore – as in Holland or Belgium.

L.P.S. Isolate occupied fr. unoccupied France for S.O.E. and adminn. purpose. And broadly, bring de G. in on former while excluding him fr. latter.

S and Not so simple. Unoccupied is base for work in occupied Fr.

S/Doms.

A.E. 3 (adminn.) – postpone till after Torch.

2 S.O.E. S.I.S. etc., Bring him in for occupied Fr., and leave ourselves a freer hand with unoccupied.

1 Operations. What do C.O.S. say?

C.A.S. We cdn’t disclose until late stage, for security reasons.

123

L.P. What wd. you say to him. Afraid of their flying off the handle if told nothing. Wd. prefer to tell them outline and put them on honour not to disclose.

V.C.I.G.S. They know we have plans. We can say v. little w’out going into some detail.

Any detail passed on to people at de G. HQ. is gone – no security at all.

If we begin and then have to refuse to go further into detail, we are worse off than ever.

S/Doms. Can you bring him in as technical expert – eg on tanks?

W.O. Adding insult to injury.

L.P.S. Can’t keep him fr. knowing what we are at, can you?

V.C.I.G.S. Apart fr. Bulitt, yes.

A.E. I think he knows already.

But I wd. be ready to rely on 2 for time being and hold up 1 to 3 until after Torch.

My problem is to prevent an explosion when he hears about Torch.

L.P.S. What is objns. to 3?

W.O. It runs back into 1. Also U.S. have the lead on this.

S/Air. After Torch you really can’t keep him out of prepns. on Round-up.

S/Doms. Imposs. to give him inf. about opr. plans far in advance.

Imposs. to keep him out of considn. of adminve. problems.

Needs looking into.

Halifax. Can’t discuss opern. plans.

Can talk to him about S.O.E. activities. Explore and discuss: &amp; gain time.

Adminn. – discuss with him principles on hypothesis not plans.

Principle – gain time, talk, tell him nothg. about plans.

124

L.P. Fact tht. C-in-C is American citizen does not mean that the source of all judicial power is American. He is i/c on behalf of U.Nations.

W.O. V.well. Then my objn. still stands because the Americans take this line. I’m not saying its not our affair : I’m saying only tht. it may be diff. to carry U.S. Army with us on this point.

Agreed. Approach U.S. Govt. on 3 and get their consent (F.O.).

A.E. Beware of developments after Torch. Someone else may come fwd.

L.P. Courted trouble by keeping de G. at arms length.

Agreed - (Do 2 and 3 (subject to U.S. consent)

( Leave 1 above.

Death Sentences in Belfast.

S/Doms. 6 men condemned to death in Belfast for shooting policeman. Appeal now pending.

Repves. from Eire and U.S. Govt.

Have we any views? Ordinarily p. of mercy is for Govr. N/Ireland: but clause in instructions tht. he personally with advice of his Ministers shd. consider any case in wh. national interest involved.

L.P. Only one precedent. Prison wardens in Londonderry Gaol killed by accident in an escape. G/N.Ireland favoured execution. Fitzalan instred. by HMG. tht. on political grounds he must recommend reprieve and did so.

L.P. Intentn. of instns. – enable Govr. who ordinarily is constitutional sovereign bound act advice Ministers, to exercise personal discretion. Not intended to put Govr. in posn. that he mut do what U.K. Ministers advise. He must take a/c advice fr. N.I. Minister : but he carries a personal responsibility too. He is not bound to take advice of U.K. Ministers.

Put to test in Fitzalan’s case. It was repd. v. strongly to him tht. larger interests of Empire cd. only be served by reprieve. After much anxiety, he decided himself to follow that advice, or take that view.

S/Doms. We cannot therefore avoid considering tendering our advice.

H.O. If a case arises when Empire or foreign consns. are involved, Govr. must take them into a/c and we may wish to give him our views.

Does this case come w’in that category? Eire and U.S. raised ques : but doesn’t follow that we are obliged to give advice.

125

Gang violence – policeman was Catholic, brave man, awarded Police medal.

Eire bound politically to raise it. If we don’t give way to him, doubt if anything will happen.

U.S. man only conveyed to us repns. by Eire Minister. Without comment.

But if we advise contrary to N.I.Govt. trouble.

My view therefore is tht. likelihood of repercussions not such as to require our intervention.

Seriousness of gang murder.

War Cab. shd. not ask me to intervene at all. Not a case of the character wh. calls for any intervention by U.K. Ministers.

S/Doms. I am told a) promiscuous shooting.

b) we don’t shoot 6 men for 1 death in this country.

c) bound to have trouble in Eire if we don’t reprieve; and some influence in U.S.

d) U.S. troops in N.Ireland, whose Govt is not judicially minded.

A.E. I went thro’ this over Coventry murder. And I will now admit I was in the wrong. There was no trouble in Eire, or America.

L.P. Gave particulars of Coventry case.

On ques of ( Never bn. practice of H.O. to reduce no. hanged by

6 people (reason smallness no. killed

killing one (Might discriminate on basis of degree of complicity.

Agreed. – insufficient grounds to intervene. Shd. be stated in terms of “Ministers here” or Cabinet – not personal responsibility as in case of murder in U.K.
