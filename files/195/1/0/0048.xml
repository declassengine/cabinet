W.M.(42)149th Meeting 3rd November 1943.

I. United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

B/T. Ask W. Cab. authy. to reply to U.S. on lines in Annex.

Mechanism – lynch-pin a Policy Cttee (Part 3) U.S. G.B. U.S.S.R. China.

Not committed at this stage to any precise promises as rgds. extent.

Agreement to be subject to our point about Canada being on Policy Cttee. We therefore recommend members extended to 7 incldg. Canada.

Raise ques with Doms. India and U.S.S.R. before reply to U.S.A.

P.M. Don’t let us drift into attitude tht. we can’t speak to U.S. before consulting U.S.S.R.

A.E. On this occasion we have already had consultns. with U.S. : we are referring to U.S.S.R. only at this stage before formal communication to U.S. This agreement was initiated by U.S.A.

P.M. May be right as diplomacy – but no rigid rule.

“No obligation on us to consult Stalin before we communicate with U.S.” Can that maxim be recorded.

L.P.S. Depends on subject matter. This is one affectg. Europe. Right tht. we shd. let U.S.S.R. be informed of nature of reply wh. we propose to send.

P.M. As rgds. Canada, everyone surely agrees.

S/Doms. Diffy : if you bring in all Doms, it will open the door to v. many others.

We must preserve our freedom to bring in one or other Doms. w’out all.

C.O. Para III 3. – (a small point not perfectly heard!)

P.M. Will you at least omit [ ] from para 5.

A.E. Very well.

Agreed – subject to omission of this phrase in communications sent.

170

S/Air. Proposed that this Body shd. deal with p.o.war. Wd. it not be better to leave this to military? B/T. undertook to clear this up with S/Air.

II. Post-War Atlantic Bases.

A.E. Scheme promoted by Norway – after consultn. with Dutch and Belgians.

P.M. Why do you want bases on Continent? Tremendous departure in foreign policy.

A.E. V. like S. Inland bases.

P.M. If air is reason – deal with that by international control of air forces, not by seeking and maintaining air bases all over the world.

S/Doms. When we thought in terms of sea-power, we secured bases all over the world. Worth considering.

L.P.S. Perhaps : but don’t say it has our political support. That, surely is going much too far.

A.E. This is not national policy – proposal is that G.B., U.S. and countries concerned shd. join in this.

L.P.S. Enough to say we are prepd. to explore the situation.

M/L. Unwise to deal with this piecemeal.

L.P.S. Selection, at initiation of Norway and based on a particular Alliance.

A.E. Americans have already bn. discussing this with Dutch and Norwegians.

If U.S went on with this and we were left out it wd. be v. awkward.

Prepd. however to re-draft para 6 in light of discussions : and circulate as amended.

Smuts. U.S. original demand for bases fr. us was a mistake : now abandoned.

Equally mistaken for us to claim bases in Europe.

We don’t know where we’ll stand after the war.

And what precedents will you set : Russia will want them too. And when will it end?

Whatever the small defeated countries say now, many people will say later on that this was pure Imperialism.

171

Policy for Europe shd. not be initiated by the smaller Powers “as and when”. Wait till we are ready to make the right approach. Let these ques. be considered by the Big 2 or 3 – don’t listen to cries of agony fr. the minor sufferers.

An item like this might be fitted into a larger scheme – we must see the pattern.

L.P.S. Then can we see the memo. prepd. by F.O.

III Malta.

P.M. Preserve status quo until we see what happens in Torch.

Defer this item until Wed.
