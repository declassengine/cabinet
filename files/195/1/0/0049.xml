W.M.(42)150th Meeting 4th November 1942.

I. Rudolf Hess.

P.M. Include reference to health and fall over bannisters etc.

L.P.S. : Separate statement.

P.M. Why not say on verge of insanity.

L.P.S. He wasn’t when he arrived : we can’t say he was.

P.M. Add – “medical report follows”; and put an addendum.

None of this for publicn. – for Maisky only.

F.O. Will send this to C. Kerr today saying “medical report follows”.

II. King’s Speeches.

Controversial legislation.

P.M. We can’t have 50/100 Conservatives or Labour Members steadily opposing the Bill.

S/Doms. Controversy on Party lines must be avoided – but Bills raising controversy within Parties cd. be taken.

K.W. Must be a substantial measure of agreement.

S/Doms. Within the Govt. L.P. And H/Commons.

P.M. Controversial for war effort doesn’t matter.

S/Doms. But some war legisln.

P.M. Formula for pledge. – as in K.S.(42) 1st Mtg Minutes annotated.

L.P.S. Yes – but what do you mean by “genl. measure of agreement”.

P.M. Cabinet decides. It means tht. opposn. by a small group can’t hold it up.

M/L. Consider my difficulty. Labour Party and 1922 Cttee both say no organised opposn.

Then the interests outside say its controversial.

P.M. My phrase meets that. The outside interests won’t stop it if “genl. measure of agreement”.

173

M/L. Not concerned fr. Party pt. of view. Concerned about adminn. – eg demobilisation.

L.P. “A substantial measure of general agreement”. Rejected.

P.M.’s formula agreed.

P.M. No oblign. to include in K. Sp. every measure you intend to bring fwd.

Before putting a thing into K. Sp. you shd. have clear idea of what will be in the Bill. E.g. Education Bill. Nothing better than to reach concordat. But want to be sure we shan’t get into religious controversy.

S. Both sides have forgotten the catch-words of 40 yrs. ago. R.A.B. has gone v. far and skilfully and is v. near to an agreement.

R.A.B. 2/3rds of my plan is ready for Cabinet. Sketch of other third (training of youth : with M/Labour).

Scott and Uthwall Reports.

P.M. Promise here of legislation.

S/Doms. Only on machinery.

P.M. Where are the heads of the Bill?

K.W. We may agree at once on machinery and compulsory purchase by l.a.’s. But previous ref. in para. talks about compensation and betterment etc. wh. are all matters on wh. we are unlikely to reach early agreement.

P.M. Vague : general. Will create diffies.

L.P. Need this be in the Speech – can’t it be dealt with in the Debate.

Catering Trades.

M/L. Trying to complete organn. of Trade Boards. Next trade is catering trades.

Can’t apply to Trade Bd. to it because too amorphous a trade.

Same principle as Road Haulage Wage Bd.

174

Gnl. agreement or support fr. many sections of the industry. But Hotels and Rest Assocn. are raising the cry of controversy.

P.M. What about one-man family business?

M/L. That is matter for the Commn.

If you had a Trade Bd. it wd. have to cover them.

K.W. Cdn’t you appoint the Commn. to enquire (non statutory) and promote legn. later to implement their recommns. group by group.

3 Enquiries so far led to nothing.

M/L. But that was on scope – whtr. Trade Bds. cd. be applied to this industry.

Ch.Whip. a) I’m being asked is this necessary for the war.

b) If this goes into the K. Speech, we’ll get an amendment to the Address.

M/L. The trade is organised in Switzerland and in U.S.A.

P.M. I’m not against reguln. of wages in these trades. The only ques is whtr. it wd. raise distracting controversy wh. we shd. find it diff. to overbear. You may get obstruction – eg. by Herbert Williams.

S/Doms. What about a Standing Cttee?

L.P.S. Let them have it on the floor. Keep them quiet.

Ch/Whip. Do you need to start the controversy early by puttg. it in K. Speech.

Agreed – Omit fr. K. Speech : but go on with the Bill (mentioning it in the Debate).

175
