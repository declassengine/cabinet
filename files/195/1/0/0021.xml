W.M.(42)96th Meeting 27th July, 1942

Air Raids

H.O. Thurs/Frid. 40. inland – scattered.

Sat/Sun. 20 “ Middlesbrough. Considbl. damage to bldgs &amp;

communcns.

I.C.I. Billingham – prodn. will be held up.

Mon. am. 5.45a.m. S. Coast. 7a.m. E. Anglia. 7.30. N.E.

25 in all. Every Region except Scotland &amp; Newcastle had

warnings and in most bombs dropped.

Derby – R. Royce: central machine stores? shop.

2nd near R.Royce works.

Witham – Critall’s.

Swindon – GWR works &amp; gas-holder.

Noticeable how widespread the attack was. Worrying – need to get them down.

Active defence shd. be as lively as possible.

C.A.S. We scattered them. but weather was v. diff. for us.

Precision bombing by isolated aircraft v. diff. to stop.

AA. claimed damaged one – only, tho’ fire opened at many places.

III. Eire Officers at Battle Schools in N. Ireland

P.M. W.O. propose they shd. attend. Americans will be at these schools as well as British.

Situation changed as cpd. 2 yrs ago – no risk now of invasion of Ireland: at least tht. danger has receded.

S/Doms. This won’t affect Eire neutrality. If attacked she will fight. Important therefore to make them as efficient as possible. And also encourage them by supplies (Item 3 on Agenda IV).

Comp. small amounts. Mil. authies. in Eire v. co-operative.

We have given them small amount fr. time to time.

80

P.M. Doubtful about giving them mines. – to lay in Eire harbours : against whom?

Don’t mind the other things so much.

S/Doms. AA guns &amp; indicators.

S/Air. Surely we cd. do with these ourselves.

H.O. Eire cdn’t defend herself : we wd. have to do it. They have untrustworthy elements.

S/Col. Good thing to back up mil. authies. esp. Mulcay (?)

A.V.A. 1st Sea Lord : I am opposed to supply of mines.

P.M. AA Guns : predictions – don’t we need them e.g. Biggin Hill. Surely those points shd. have priority over Eire.

S/Doms. But this list passed by V/C.D.S. as what we cd. give if ques of policy cleared. Their view = useful to let Eire have these, for support of their mil. authies, if no political objection to sending them.

P.M. C.O.S. to examine afresh.

S/Doms. Yes – quite apart from any political question.

P.M. Courses – discuss separately.

No sufft. objn. to that.

S/Doms. But this connection that if they are taught to handle weapons they will want the weapons the more.

S/Col. Shd. not N. Ireland Govt. be consulted?

H.O. Yes. I will look into this.

IV. Power of Punishment to Indian Commissioned Officers.

S/India. K. Comm. Offrs. have the power. ) Small matter, but cause v. great

Ind “ was not given that ) diffy in mixed formns. &amp; great

power. ) resentment.

Matter raised 3 mos. ago. as matter of urgency, by Viceroy. I put W.O. objns. to Viceroy and have now had his view C – in – C – as in memo.

B. Offrs. throughout Indian Army wd. support their view.

This is a distinction on ground of colour.

81

W.O. King Command. offr. V. few were approved, after last war – but died out. Viceroys Commn. is now normal practice.

Not a small thing.

Sooner or later we may have to do this. But face of white man in East is low enough and this is not the time to do it. Gandhi’s likely movement.

A.V.A. Navy – no real precedent because no mixture of black and white crews.

S/Air. Matter of discipline, not principle. Offr. shd. not have to go outside his unit to find some other offr. who can punish. The posn. in R.A.F. is the same.

We wd. be willing to change, but wd. need legisln.

C.I.G.S. Have to do it ultimately – but not now.

L.P.S. If they are fit to command, they should not be denied the attributs of command.

L.P. Why is it more degrading to be punished by an Indian than to be ordered by one?

S/Doms. Really logic of W.O. case is opposition to Indianisation.

L.P.S. Drew attention to x/ in Memo.

P.M. But political capital will be made out of it in India.

S/India. No. Will encourage our friends.

M/L. Cdn’t India Cttee or some other body ascertain the facts. Particularly. whtr legn. is involved. /How many offrs. have arrived at this posn. etc./

[S.India. Viceroy wants statement made this week.]

Warning to Congress

P.M. (1) Report to Cabinet showing no. of offrs. who (have) K.Commn. //

(have not)

(whr. it will involve legisln.)

(2) On larger issue, circulate the text and I will see whtr. it need come to Cab.

If any member of War Cab. has an objn. he can inform Sir E. B.

V. Reduction of Hours of Broadcasting.
