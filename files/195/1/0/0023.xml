I. PM’s Visit. Leakage

S/Doms. Fri. night Lisbon – then in Continental Press. Telegram from P.M. fr. Gib.

i.e. before answer recd. fr. Moscow.

M/F. Bullitt? Talking e.g. about Torch.

EEB. Reports prevalent in Lisbon pm 31/7. Then on Transocean 5 a.m. 1/8.

Experts say cipher break unlikely.

S/Doms. a) Enquiry into leak

b) When shd. we now announce? Read terms of P.M.’s note and telegram sent to him: suggesting we shd. now disclose visit to Moscow.

L.P.S. Diff. betwn. offl. announcement and mere rumour. Second much less certain. May be a “fish” to elicit the announcement.

S/Doms. Trouble if we hold it.

L.P.S. Don’t assume they know for certain. Announce it in Secret Session only. And do it Tuesday. i.e. no public announcement about Moscow part of visit.

M/L. Leave it to P.M. to decide what he announces about Moscow.

Leakage: enquiry.

89

S/Doms. By “C” – or if more formally someone else eg AG.

II Service Pay and Allowances.

W.O. Two questions Tuesd (Lyons and S.O. Davies) soldiers pay. Don’t want to give a stalling answer without knowing mind of Cab.

Seen Erskine Hill (as sugged. by C/E). Went over figures. No poss. competing US rates. Always some anomalous comparisons possible. He nevertheless said he wd. press for another ½ day. 1922 Ctte. however, not thought to have any definite ideas.

Last time Cab. decided to give somethg. tho’ Senior Ministers thought a few minor concessns. wd. do.

Posn. looks like slipping. D. Herald has said increases wd. be made.

Non-Ministerial Members of Army Council (prev. against increase). Married soldiers small balance in favour of industrial employee. civilians. Small intrinsic case therefore for some rise. But Press have led troops to think they’re underpaid – psycholog. diff. Recommended therefore 1/= a day rise, privates, grading down with higher rank. Nothg. more on allowances – tinkering with fam. allces. wouldn’t give same result. Officers : promed. to Lieut. at 6 mos vice 18. If that done, no case for genl. increase – tho’ some case for increasing married allowces. – outfit allowces.

Answer suggtedd by Ty. won’t do if there’s any ques. of standing pat. “Await debate” answer will invite contd. Press agitation.

A.V.A. Genl. ques – no time to consider.

Last time (April) were willg. to stand fast. Cab. gave way – at cost of £11.65.

Agitation growing. Wd like to have more time for details.

Pay of offrs. (junior) we are anxious about : and already in conce with Ty. on this.

V. little demand in R.N. fr. ratings – except for genl. background.

S/Air. Agree about junior offrs. Feelg. tht. they are underpaid. Wd. like that considered. Pilot offr. and flying offr. Promn (first) at 6 vice 12 mos. wd. help.

Want not to discourage young offrs. fr. marrying and having families. Consider therefore increased allowces. for offrs. with children.

90

Allowces while livg. with families – but get “consolidated allowces if they move away from families. This is hard on families. Wd. please R.A.F. if “consolidated” allowces abolished.

But can’t do this for offrs. and for men. Admit no pressure for increased pay fr. ranks. Propose therefore increase 1/= p. day for AC2. reducg. to 6d p. day for sergeants.

K.W. Last increase. Cab. Cttee apptd. to consider. At opening each Serv. Mintr said no demand for further increase and that they didn’t ask for any. Partly true of W.O. When I said some increase necessary to meet P.M. the W.O. objected and strongly : and put it in writing that there was no case. Demand shd be resisted. Non-Service Ministers on Cttee thought somethg shd. be done (partly because of reln. to industrial workers).

When our Rpt. considered, thought so important tht. P.M. said he wd.

announce it.

Reasons a) concessions important b) avoid continuing pressures for more: “final” award. We have since answd. Ques in this sense.

Since then – arrival of U.S. troops and many more to come. About 6 weeks ago P.M. asked what was being considered about U.S. soldiers. I have talked to Winant. Hoped some of their pay might be retained in the U.S.A. Winant said this was out of ques – settled by Congress and jealously guarded by them. Any suggn. fr. us wd. be v. ill-received.

Not a hope of Congress legislating now, when elections pending : little

hope thereafter.

Mitigating action taken thro’ Bolero – U.S. military authorities co-operating well in these

In Northern Ireland the men are in fact sending a lot home, of own free will.

80%-90% were doing the right thing.

No hope of basing our pay on U.S. standard.

This really is only material change in circs. since last decision.

Views in H/Commons.

Conservatives : agitn. engineered by Taylor M.P. and one or two others with v. little influence. Taylor got cold welcome from 1922

Cttee. If anything to be done, not on basic pay.

91

Labour. Saw Milner MP (Chairman : Sub-Cttee on Services). Impressed mainly with allowances – tho’ they wd. have to ask for ½ p.day on basic.

Merits.

W.O. put fwd. nothing much but agitation in Press &amp; its unsettling effect.

V. flimsy reason for increased expenditure £M.85-100 at 1/= p.day (incldg. C.D. Services)

And a new level set wh. may have to extend into the peace – when armed Forces of same size will prob. have to be maintained for some time. Effect in reducg. our capacity to afford some re-construction plans.

Anyhow advocate White Paper setting out comparative position.

Officers.

Admy. have asked for increase for all offrs up to Admiral – and no rise for ratings. Wd. be ready to agree to statement giving no encouragement or expectations but indicatg. Cab. Cttee to enquire. Put out at same time W.Paper on Facts.

L.P.S. Say we’ll lay a White Paper on facts and say no more, save you’ll have a Debate after recess. If anything said about “considering”, we shall not be able to avoid concessions setting out facts as to Serv. remuneration.

K.P. (Gt misapprehension as to Serv. emoluments and how they

(compare other walks of life and W.Paper with show it.

M/L. Take care not to draw too sharp contrast betwn. industry &amp; Services

L.P.’s formula wd. do better.

A.E. W.O. to agree terms of answer with L.P.S. and M/L &amp; Treasury.

(“settg. out all material necessary to enable judgement to be

(formed”.

(Refer to misunderstanding as in L.P.’s phrase.

M/L. C/Exchequer to answer this Ques as it affects all 3 Services – Agreed.

M/L. Wd. like statement on expenses wh. offrs. have to invent. White Paper

to be done by Service Depts + Ty. after consultation with M/Labour.

III Russian Convoy. Statement in Parliament.

S/Doms. P.M. thought unwise to make public statement.

92

L.P.S. But all I want to know is whtr. if pushed for informn in Secret Session, I should say something on the lines of the Press statement.

A.E. Last para. Puttg scattering items is no v. good. Reverse order.

S/Air. Third para. Yet when threat materialised they withdrew.

Ch.Whip. Vague – no indicn. how serious losses were – House unlikely to be satisfied.

General feeling that the statement cd. be improved – in detail.

L.P.S. If Shinwell gets on to this, we’ll move into Secret Sessn. make some such statement as this. Prob. Thursday.

A.V.A. I will prepare another draft (for considn Tuesd) bearg. in mind Saty’s decision and today’s discussion. Agreed.

IV Statements about Second Front

S/Doms. Don’t see that much can be done. Radcliffe not in favour of seeing Editors.

A.V.A. This kind of thing does “impinge on security”.

L.P. But you only check statements of fact – not expns. of opinion.

A.E. You cd. tell Editors how that one sentence came into the communiqué.

As rgds. Maisky saw him – he promised stringent instns to see tht. nothing more will be put out by Embassy.

W.O. These demands are doing much harm – to spirit of nation &amp; Army.

K.W. Too late and too dangerous to touch this.

L.P.S. B’brook Mtgs. No good dealing with this on “Press” lines.

Radcliffe here entered the meeting. Said – nothg. cd. usefully be said to Editors unless you cd. tell them definitely that it wd. or wd. not, take place.

V Foreign Affairs

A.E. a) Russian Convoys. Re-routing requd. We have agreed nothing fr. here to be shipped via Persian Gulf that can go direct fr. U.S.A. Politically disadvantageous – economically sound.

Exceptn. 4 ships with 100 Hurricanes etc.

93

b) Second Front. Soviet News Saty. “Hitler is takg. 20 Divns fr. West”, Spkg. to Maisky on this.

c) Evacuation fr. M/East. Stay-put – some modifn. wanted in Persia Palestine Iraq. Agreed.

d) Telegram fr. Seymour. Can Air Miny. and other Service Dpts think again for more help to China. E.g. cd. we swop with American squadrons. S/Air to consider.

L.P.S. The Loan?

A.E. No. What they really want is to have this for post war. We won’t do that even for Doms. Seymour is sendg. another telegram on this. We’ll reconsider when that is in.
