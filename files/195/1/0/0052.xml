W.M.(42)155th Meeting 19th November 1942.

I. Migration to Dominions.

S/Doms. Ask for authy. to consult Doms. on genl. ques.

Consulting. with Smuts and some other Dom. Ministers.

Bruce. Agree – sooner the better.

But approach will provoke enquiries as to post-war world economy – if expansionist, there will be room etc. Useful start made in discussions on economic ques. But this enquiry will intensify Dom. curiosity about these ques. No harm in that.

Migration fr. Europ. countries shd. also be opened.

We want, most people fr. here. but problem : people unwilling to sacrifice their rights here.

x/ Means will have to be found to get over this. Eg. reciprocal system. wh. will work in favour of Doms because more of our people go out.

Diffies. of this shd. be tackled.

Agreed. (includg. demobilisation in Doms.)

D.O. to consult with Ty. on x/.

Bruce I won’t take part in domestic discns. But may I spk. to S/Doms. later and learn your conclns. for commn. to Australia.

M.A.J. Survey – no decisions requd. Review of genl. economic sitn. post-war.

Para. 6-7 summary. Background for our study of detailed problems.

S/Doms. Next report – means to avoid sudden deflation.

M/L. Only way through will be All Party Govt. for ¾ years after war.

184

K.W. Post-war credits – sudden increase of purchasing power – need to continue savings – v. unpopular : can be done only by united Govt.

M/L. Inducement to convert into capital goods. E.g. bonus if they put the money into house.

1.8m. marriages w’out homes.

A. Bldg. trade have bn. induced to put up a training scheme. Wd. like to announce a 20 years’ bldg : but who will announce M/H. or M/Planning. V. big thing if they will train at rate of 100.000 a year. V. important because we shall be longer this time in re-tooling (12/18 mos.). Bldg. therefore is first line of defence v. unemployment.

M.A.J To convene Cttee to decide a) demarcation betwn. M/H. on housing.

b) training scheme.

c) post-war bldg. programme.

Training a) 3/4 mos. course for dilution.

b) longer period for crafts

B. Importance of setting agricultural policy. Wd. like to retain 1m. in ag. for some years.

This is less dependent on external affairs.

W.A.J. Report now being considered by R.P. Cttee.

P.M. What prospects of getting our export trade back? What likelihood of U.S. agreeing not to have high tariffs?

L.P.S. India – will demand goods v. their accumulated credits.

P.M. You’ll get no return from them because K.W. has “borrowed” the credits already.

Controlled currency : but only w’in limits.

K.W. Increase of consuming power + steady price level : this will give us

best hope.

M/L. Price level I wd. aim at is about present level. This wd. enable you to recover the export trade. Aim : 30% rise in c/living as above the war. There wd. be slight fall in prices, and this wd. relieve the Exchequer cost of stabilisation.

K.W. First step of all is to begin our talks with U.S. Hope we shall begin soon.

185

M/L. Better understandg. than ever before of value as against money – and real fear of depreciation.

L.P.S. V. desirable to do it before pol. landslide in U.S.

K.W. Genl. approval of paras. 6-8 of W.P.(42)347? Agreed.

IV Demobilisation.

P.M. Based on length of service (yes) and age (no)! The young men won’t wait. Experience of last war. “First out, first home” is the only principle they will understand.

M/L. But this time they’ve bn. called in by age group : and this means reversing the way they come out. Age therefore is a good criterion, now. Length of service introduced because benefit to territorials and those who volunteered early.

Explain it to Army in advance – so they will understand.

Para. 6 of W.P.(42)498 – Approved.

Para. 13

L.P.S. how far does (1) go?

W.A.J. See para 12.

S/Air. Para 6(a)4. Will this be made public now.

W.A.J. No. Public statement is para 13.

P.M. * War Cab. not C.D.S. to decide.

Paras 6 and 13. Agreed.

V. Statement by Paymaster General.

K.W. This surely is o.k.

Agreed.

Reference to p. 1. can’t go too fast.

V. Statement by Paymaster General.

VI Central Planning Authority.

K.W. First alternative: Cttee of Ministers + Commission for planning.

Second “ : planning to be responsibility of a M/Planning.

Planning to be looked after by a Cttee of Ministers

186

Commission for some purposes – semi.judicial etc.

By this compromise we shd. hope to meet Parly Beching v Uthwatt Rpt.

Set up: Planning = Cttee of Ministers

Planning = Minister + Commission to help him.

This is going to help, esp. with dissident Conservatives.
