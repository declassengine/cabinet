W.M.(42)81st Meeting 25th June 1942 

A.V.A Anxious to show tht. at this stage shippg. is so critical tht. it can’t be met only by a) relying on bldg., incldg. American and b) limiting consumption of imports. Admy. feel tht. sh. Cttee Rept. is optimistic. Unless we reduce sinkings loss will be more than 6.5 m.tons. 3½m. already by enemy action this year. Other causes, marine losses etc, will be 650.000 tons. The gap will be therefore 7.5m.tons, or something like it. 

Expectations for next 6 mos. Losses 1st half of year due largely to U-Boats in W.Atlantic. 

2.221.000 tons = losses since 12/1 off U.S. Coasts &amp; in Caribbean. 

513 ships convoyed &amp; total losses 3 all mined – Results of Key West Convoy. 

120 ships convoyed &amp; total losses 3. – Aruba convoy. 

Convoys thus improvg. the posn. – but this only means tht. U-Boats will move elsewhere. 

Assistce. to U.S. has meant re-arrangement of our convoy groups in N. Atlantic : and when U-Boats move there we shall be less well equipped to beat them off. 

Expected U-Boat strength. In 13 German ports 271 U-Boats bldg. or fitting out now. 

By March 500 will be available, 140 wd. be always training or fitting. 

Unless we can sink a good many there will be 500 workg. against us by July ’43. 

Losses of escort vessels &amp; destroyers v. heavy in first 6 mos. - 30 destroyers alone. 

Replacement of merchant vessels. Much depends on fulfilment of original progress. 

Diversion of U.S. effort is bldg. of escort ships reduces their programme of merchant ships. 

Vital therefore to concentrate attack on U-Boats at sea. 

We can’t guarantee tht. there won’t be increasg. losses in next 6 months. 

Thus, too dangerous to seek to restore posn. only by a) and b) at outset. 

59 

Extended help fr. R.A.F. during last few weeks shown how much more cd. be done with greater air attack. 

S/Doms These points for review – 

a) prospects of building 

b) efficacy of. convoy system 

c) offensive v. U-Boat as cpd. with defensive action by merchant ship. 

(a) 

M/Prodn. U.S. Bldg. Prospects v. good. 

30.000 tons d.wt. over schedule in May. 

8m tons d.wt. in 1942. Shortage of plate might reduce it to 7.5 m. tons. 

20m tons in 1943. 

M/W.T. Much of this will be taken away for other use – e.g. aircraft carriers. 

S/Doms Cd. Kaiser’s methods be applied here? 

M/P. No. Pre-fabrication carried to an extent not feasible in this country. 

Escort vessels. Optimum = 20 : 100 merchant ships. Or prs. 17. 

Our programmes provided hitherto for only 5 : 100. 

A.V.A. The escort vessels won’t affect the posn. until at least end 1942. 

S/Doms The rest of this year will be v. tight. What will posn. be in 1943? 

Does M/P. report mean tht. U.S. building will offset our losses? 

L.P. Only if we get the use of that tonnage. 

M/W.T. We can get no indication of that. 

Danger is margin of error, on the balance sheet – 3m. tons either way. 

That is the significant feature because it cuts not into margin but into essentials. 

M/W.T. Our calculations were on U.S. building of 14 m. tons for ’43. 

60 

M/P. I am pretty sure that they will get their big increase on this, apart from diversion of yards to escort vessels wh. might mean 2m. tons d.wt. U.K. Production. 

A.V.A. 1¼ m. g. tons. + Canada = 1.7 m. g. tons 

7.2 m. g. tons incldg. U.S. production. 

And losses may be anything up to 7.5 m.tons. 

So there will be some loss in a year when we want to see increase in shipping available for offensive purpose. 

S/Doms. Will there be any compensation because new ships are faster? 

M/W.T. We have gone as far as we can in this direction. Can’t push speeds for tramps. U.S. standard speed for tramps 11½ knots. 

A.V.A. In last war considered this. Now again have considered gains and losses from fast ships. 

11 knot ship in 7 knot convoy = 4 round voyages = 77.600 tons cargo)11% 

15 “ 5.4 “ “ = 69,000 “ “ ) 

)worse off. 

Because of bunker &amp; engine capacity in relation to cargo space. 

S/Doms. Is the 15 knot safer than 11 knot in convoy? 

M/W.T. No. 

M/W.T. Our losses of over 15 knot routed independently are less in propn. to those of ships in convoy. And we are getting an increasing no. of these. 

A.V.A. Large addn. to convoy losses because of losses in conntn. with military operations. Doubt whtr. balance wd. be. much in favour of independent sailings if these excluded. 

L.P. From pt. of view of cargo-carrying capacity, do you favour faster ships? 

M/W.T. I don’t altogether agree with A.V.A’s view on this. 

M/L. Why have we stood aside from welding – as done in U.S.A. 

A.V.A. We cdn’t have laid them out in our shipyards. Only 3-4 yards cd. do it. 

And labour required. Admy. doing somethg. in this way – as much as they can. 

61 

M/L. Don’t agree. Ship-builders have held it back because it doesn’t fit in with their future. 

L.P.S. Why not get Kaiser over? 

M/P. First await results of investigation into ship. bldg. methods – by Panel of M/P.’s appointmt. 

S/Doms. Replacement 1943. 

M/W.T. Everything depends on what we can get from U.S.A. Hopkins has said they’d get us 24 m. tons of imports – keep up at this rate. 

L.P. But the Sh. Cttee calculation is based on running down stocks on assumption of v. much increased rate of imports in second half of ’43. 

(b) Efficacy of Convoy System. 

A.V.A. No indicn. of decrease in U-Boats fr. June to Dec. – increasing – yet losses posn. was improvg. because effective escorts. 

Posn deteriorated since Dec because entry of Japan into the war. 

If U.S. entry into war hadn’t opened W. Atlantic to U-Boats we shd. have expected to do even better against continuance of attack in W. Approaches. 

S/Doms. Cd. you give us figures for nos. of unsuccessful attacks? 

A.V.A. Yes. But you’d have to allow for deterrent effects of large escort strength. 

M/P. 17% of nominated ships for Bolero already sunk! 

M/W.T. When U.S. convoy plans completed, we shall expect improvement because bulk of the vessels will remain w’in the protectn. – only a small propn. will have to go on outside the convoy. But this is what I wd. rely on to estimate that the present rate of 7.5 m. losses will not take us over-all above 6.5 m. from the year. 

(c) Offensive against U-Boats. 

A.V.A. Many come fr. Biscay - &amp; you can get them there more easily. 

They stay out 6-8 weeks – of wh. 12/14 days on target station. 

M/W.T. Americans will now press us to do more to stop them coming out. 

S/Doms. What can we do? 

62 

A.V.A. Nothing more than increased air attack. 

L.P.S. Methods of increasing cargo space. Towing cargo shells eg. Have all these bn. considered? 

M/W.T. Studied &amp; abandoned because of danger to ships. Now being considered again – made of glass. 

S/S. Air. Ready to co-operate. 

Diverted 4 squadrons fr. Bomber to Coastal. 

84% of bldg. capacity for U-Boats is w’in reach of Bomber Command all the year round. And we think the best way of keeping down the U-Boats is to hit them in the places where they are being built. 64% are bldg. in Bremen, Kiel &amp; Hamburg. 

Raid on Emden was particularly successful. U-Boat yard hard hit. 

A.V.A. This we welcome – but it won’t effect the nos. of U-Boats in operation in next 6 months. 

L.P. If you cd. deal equal destruction at sea and at yard, balance wd. be in favour of attack at sea because you kill the crews also.
