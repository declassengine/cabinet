W.M.(42)107th Meeting 7th August 1942 (5pm)

III Alexandria

L.P. Register essential. But pref. perhaps to do it for some other ostensible purpose.

Telegram approved.

IV Statements about a Second Front

L.P.S. Many letters – Press repves. approach – suggn. that somethg more shd. be said.

Favour statement of what might be done – on lines discussed in Cab – other day.

S/Doms P.M. said “you can say we are going to have a 2nd Front this year”. Some Ministers doubted whtr he said “this year”.

“Agree…urgent task” doesn’t imply decision to do it.

L.P.S. The communiqué is what causes the diffy.

M/L. Wise to say anything before P.M. sees Stalin? Anything said now wd. surely prejudice his talks. Best line surely is to keep quiet.

S/Doms. Public interest a) B. and b) Russian. We wdn’t know how any statement of ours might affect Russian public opinion.

Now it’s only a ques of waiting for a few days – and H/Commons not now sitting.

M/L I told 1.500 delegates of bldg. trade what this bldg. was for. The

knowledge that we are moving is seeping through, surely.

Isn’t that the best way of letting people know. Best form of propaganda is to avoid Press like plague and tell people adding that it’s a great secret!

Wait therefore till we get the text out of the P.M. – Stalin talks.

Agreed – await P.M. communiqué – then consider what we say on whole question.

V India

L.P.S. If object to divorce India fr. G.? desirable to say somethg to acknowledge Tej B…. S…. movement. Help to divorce moderates from G. – and distract thoughts from G.

100

Draft submn. as basis for discussion – handed round.

L.S.A. No use at this stage trying to do anything to help S’s movement.

Clear fr. conee with G. tht. he has put off real response to this: and Nehru has said time for this is past.

Congress isn’t interested in constitutional ques – only in creating revolut. movemt.

Futile: also bad effect on mod. opinion in India and on Ex. Council. Some members of that Council are beginning to weaken. This wd. tend to make them wobble even more.

Tel. 2315-5. We cdn’t make such a move after Congress resoln. passed.

Firm action essential now.

Convention of V. agreeing with Ex Council grown rapidly. He must be given every chance of carrying them with him.

L.P. Don’t think Sapru cuts any ice. This nd. be taken as sign of weakness on our part.

Acc. to Press. G has said publicly nothg. drastic will follow hard on passg. of resolution.

Prs. he isn’t v. sure of his ground – prs. he wants more time to prepare.

W.O. Agree. Save our statement “we wd. support him in any action in agreement with his Council”. We must make it clear tht. he must act for good of India, whr. Ex Council can be carried along or not. Some of the Members are certain to run out – But it’s his responsibility not the Council’s.

M/L. We can give way no further. Too late.

M/P. Agreed.

S/Doms. “

L.P.S. I agree tht. Congress won’t accept such overtures.

I agree to strong action v. Congress.

But I suggest this only qua effect on public opinion world-wide as well as India.

For we must not behave as tho’ G. = India.

101

L.P. Yes. But way to treat Indians at this stage is “polite but firm”. Don’t under-rate their real respect for firmness in Govt.

L.S.A. Dispose of G. first. Then seek ways of encouraging Sapru.

W.O. Will S/S. India convey to V. impression tht. time in acting shd. not be lost for sake of carrying Council with him. This can be fought and beaten : but delay at the start may lengthen the struggle.

L.P. Don’t be overworried by signs of wobble in individuals. They can be nursed into collective firmness.

L.S.A. Must [not sacrifice to this vital importance of showing firmness and determination in this crisis] to advantage of carrying Council with him. Attach v. great importance to prompt action. Will cable to V. in that sense.

L.P. Every sympathy with his desire to carry his Govt. with him : but feel sure he will [ ]

He will have the War Cabinet behind him.

L.S.A. Pressure for Finance and Home Depts for Indians. None dismissed – continuity preserved – Indianised by increasg. portfolios – no need now to turn out 2 Europeans to appease Congress elements.

S/Doms. No movement or change in this crisis. Agreed.

L.S.A. Deportn. of G. V’s reply to telegram sent last night.

W.O. This telegram confirms my disquiet in V.’s capacity to govern in such a crisis.

He is putting too much weight on carrying his Council with him.

L.P. In this part. ques. you must allow V. to be swayed by his Council’s views. I favoured deportn. because I doubted capacity of Govt. and India to stand firm. If they give a firm assurance to hold G. even tho’ he h-strikes we must accept their view on deportn. But we must get this assurance.

L.P.S. It’s beyond expediency. For detn in India, with all its implicns. will strain the competence of the Council to breakg. point.

L.S.A. Will G. fast if told in advance tht. he won’t be released if he does?

W.O. Trouble – because of V.’s weakness.

Becoming necessary to telegraph to him that he, and not his Council is responsible.

102

A.E. Sorry he has taken this decision. But can’t overrule him.

L.P. Yes. Say – we thought deportn. wd. have made his posn.easier. If he thinks t’other well : but we must ensure tht. he will hold G. in spite of h.strike.

No Cat and Mouse etc. Agreed – as in EEB’s notes.

VI M: C. Taylor, M.P. Proposed Visit to Middle East

S/Doms. Taylor M.P. invited by H. Balfour and others at Air Miny. to go to M/East to see for himself. Provided he gets P.M.’s consent. Came therefore to me.

S/Air. Let me investigate.

S/Doms. Any genl. line about M.P.’s facilities? Shd. then be a general policy?

W.O. Nothg. moved about distant Fronts. There was one tour to France. But not by self-selection.

Anyhow, he’s a military officer : and shd. get W.O. consent.

Agreed. S/Air to enquire. Permission must be refused in this case. W’out prejudice to future considn of the genl. case.
