Parliament.

L.P.S. Bernay’s Ques – Motion for discussion of Army in Secret Session.

Have suggd. to Cazalet cd. be done on K’s Speech. If they asked for S. Session, we wd. comply. They wd. accept that.

W.O. Had consulted P.M. suggestg. public Debate because of innuendos : Affect on troops in M/East – feeling of lack of confidence at home. Wd. prefer Debate later and in public.

K.W. Can you give your defence in public.

Ch.Whip. Has heard the topics wh. Bernays wishes to raise. Size of Army in relation to its role. Slow promotions for L/Corporals. Machinery for Parly. control over W.O. adminn. of Army.

L.P.S. They feel it awkward to discuss these ques in public because of their dual role as M.P.’s and junior officers.

P.M. Say on K’s speech. In principle, shd. be in public. But House can move in and out : and we cd. have a part of Debate in secret if desired.

Ch.Whip. You can’t come out again until topic concluded.

No gt. harm in secret Debate? But W.O. shd. have chance of makg. his statement. Why not have 2 Debates on this subject on the Address. Or, why not have the open Debate early on the address : and then have the Secret Sessn. on the amendment to the address. Or, preferably the other way round : debate in secret on the amendment then revive the genl. Debate in public for W.O. to reply.

Then say – this matter will be discussed in any event in Debate on Address : they can raise their matters by putting down amendment to Address and this, if House desires, can be taken in Secret.

F.O. Soviet Annual Day. demonstn. at Empress Hall. I’ve bn. asked to speak. H.O. told me however tht. it is promoted under Comm. influence. I’ve therefore refused.

My colleagues shd. know in case they are asked.

P.M. Offl. show of our own?

H.O. This is anniversary of B. revolution!

L.P.S. But in Russia it is comparable to the King’s Birthday.

H.O. i.e. the Czar’s Deathday!

152

P.M. Why not have a mtg. sometime in Nov. (no specific Russian date) – to celebrate the R. resistance. Consider this (carefully!).
