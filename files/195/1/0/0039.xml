W.M.(42)124th Meeting 14th September 1942

Foreign Affairs.

P.M. Litvinov squealing : Maisky plaintive.

Worrying about P.Q. If only 1/5 etc get thro’, is it worth while going on? More radical cuts must be considered.

Air Raid Damage.

H.O. Light week : but fear we shall get it later on.

P.M. Millstones round necks of our Bomber Command.

M/L Are we bldg. up our AA. Defence for the winter?

C.A.S. Borrowed a lot : but we have good allocation of Bofors guns for Sept. wh. we cd. use.

Current prodn. in G. – only 1.200 operational types p. month + trainers : transports. Total potential bomber strengths v. us on 1/1/43 only 450. (Intelligence estimate). That wd. mean only 250/300 on big night. Allows rather large no. in Germany re-fitting etc. V. low wdn’t put too much weight on it.

Supply of Transport Aircraft to Russia.

M/P. Saw Maisky Fri : said none in prodn. here : and only one type in large scale prodn. in U.S.A.

Promised ask P.M. to consider approach to President.

Declined to convert Wellingtons : but promised to consider other possibilities. e.g. Albemailes. There are 45 of these in maintenance units wh. in ¾ wks cd. be converted to carry 20 men. Then at 20 a month up to 250.

C.A.S. If we have to do it. A. wd. fill the bill with least cost to us. But one of the diversions wh. affect Bomber Coastal Command indirectly. They were to be used to free Hudsons. 43 Operational squadrons a year ago now only 32 in Bomber Command.

P.M. It is for U.S. if they will.

M/P. W’out repns. to President you won’t get it out of them.

M/P. Which P.Q. diffed. with Russia : we might at least do the 45 fr. maintenance units.

148

P.M. Give this as interim measure – while we look into possibility of pressure on U.S.A. Russians must press U.S.A. I won’t. Agreed. – No decision : M/Prodn.to supply P.M. with material for telegram to Stalin.

Food for Ceylon.

R.M. In Mar. Ceylon Govt. asked for rice. Move related to military sitn. – willing therefore to supply Ceylon on same basis as India. Indigenous prodn. 150.000 tons.

30.000 t. p. m. as required. 35.000 tons. April and May to build up stocks. End of April shipping sitn. deteriorated – only Karachi and country boats fr. southern ports. We did all we cd. in shipping situation – 116.000 tons in 5 months.

Then sitn. worsened. Sindh crop lost (1m. acres flooded. 800/900.000 tons out of 26m. tons). Normally we imported 1½m. ton fr. Burma.

Transport worsened. I envisaged surplus prodn. in various areas of Bengal and Orissa. Bengal 3m. tons excess. But rural areas both to send crop to market. Orissa was small surplus : Ministry will now be able to send this.

Since then commd. to supply Arabian States (on same priority) rice Burma supplies lost.

Madras now main source of surplus supply. Trouble here is transport. If we can overcome that. we cd. prob. work up to 30.000 tons.

Reluctance of Prov. Govts. to control prices. Since I left, conference wh. indicates likelihood of more price control.

Recommend urging Govt/India to concentrate on this – no Directive yet.

More effort. In reply to latest telegram.

C.O. When wd. full supply begin?

R.M. Rs. in October. Wd. deprecate pressure at this stage.

C.O. Ceylon will be out by 3rd week of Oct. We must fill the gap somehow. If I knew when Indian supply wd. come in. I cd. ask for more Australian wheat. I want current supply + 2 months’ reserve.

A.E. Only 1/80th of Indian requirements will meet Ceylon’s needs.

Jam Saheb. My area has no rice at all – eating millet.

C.O. Cd. M/W.T. Supply fr. Australia to carry us over until Oct.

149

M/W.T. 30.000 tons in Sept is all we cd do. Extravagant use of shipping.

L.S.A. Cd G/India be asked to ship as much as poss. early in Oct.

M/W.T. We can carry as much rice as India can provide.

R.M. If it only in 1 month, in advance, India cd. arrange.

Agreed. I.O. &amp; C.O. to agree procedure.
