W.M.(42)74th Meeting 15th June 1942 

Reprisal for German Massacre of Village 

P.M. Conversation with Benes about possibility of reprisal for savage cruelties now being practiced by Germans in Czechoslovakia. Suggested wiping out German villages (3 for 1) by air attack. 

View of A.D. in C. Bomber Command. 100 bombers wd. be required. Low attack 2/3rds incendiaries. Bright moonlight wd. be reqrd. Objection &amp; reasons shd. be announced aftwds. 

F.O. in favour. 

If thought worthwhile, give RAF discretion to fit it in when they can. 

L.P.S. Is accuracy of report beyond doubt? 

P.M. Germans announced. 

S/S.Air. Disliked it. Diversion of effort fr. military objective. Risking aircraft &amp; crews. Wd we not be led on to do it more &amp; more – if Germans knew we wd. answer thus. 

S/Doms. Doubt if it is useful to enter into competition in frightfulness with Germans. 

H.O. Wd. like to consider – reprisals on English villages, where no shelter, &amp; low scale a.r.p. Public wd. say “why did you draw this down on to us?” 

C.A.S. If they came in low &amp; not far inland they wd. run v. small risk. 

F.O. Even so, there might be a deterrent element in this. 

M/L. German responds to brute force &amp; nothing else. 

Bruce. It might lead to even greater atrocities in Czechoslovakia. 

General view that it wd. be wise to think this over. 

L.P. Danger is that it costs us something &amp; them nothing. Against it. 

General feeling of Cabinet – against doing this. (i.e. L.P., M/Inf., CO., H.O.) 

PM My instinct is strongly the other way. 

F.O. Strongest argument against – waste of a moonlight night. Bigger diversion than I had thought. 

44 

Amery. Why a village? Why not a quiet residential town? 

L.P.S. Operational argument against is v. strong. 

P.M. I submit (unwillingly) to the view of Cabinet against. 

India 

Amery. Viceroy increasingly convinced Ghandi means real mischief. Won’t act until after mtg. Congress Workg. Cttee beginning July. Propose circulate memo – so that Cab. may consider its line, so as to inform Viceroy. 

W.O. If need to act v. G., speed essential if effect on India is to be produced. Won’t do to wait until quite abundantly clear that action must be taken. 

L.P. Act quickly when you do – but not prematurely. And take him right out of India. 

The Levant-Caspian Front 

C.I.G.S. Easier now because R. have asked us to help to mend some of the roads in North. Possible therefore that R. may agree to proposed reconnaissances. 

Wd. F.O. take it up. 

M/L. Are our people in Persia dealg with Russians in the new spirit wh. we adopt? Wd. we not get it straighter if taken up on higher level? 

L.P.S. We have bn. foolish in our approaches, over N. Persia &amp; Caucasus – eg. trying to push people in w’out permission. 

P.M. Awkward moment – they resent enquiries wh. suggest their Front may crack. And we’re not v. strong – we’ve only 2 men &amp; a boy there, and Libya has lost us some face again. 

F.O. Why not start talkg. to R. general who is here with a broken leg. If we do, there must be clear understanding tht. while we are negotiating this our people must not snoop around on their own. 

i.e. we’ll see what can be done: but meanwhile our soldiers must behave. 

Report on Public Feeling 

P.M. Likely news for next few months will cure undue optimism. 

No practical change of the Second Front wh. newspp. think so easy. 

45 

M/I The Second Front decision is now to be celebrated at meetgs. organised all over the country. 

P.M. Can’t be helped. But Ministers shd. be careful – the less said the better on grd. of not saying anythg. about forthcoming operations. 

Re-organisation of Colonial Service 

C.O. Consid. advance already made twds unification. a) But salaries still paid by CO. Govts - &amp; poorest, who need best men, often gets worst. b) Rapid fluctuation in demands, acc. to Col. booms &amp; slumps. c) Power to remove passengers. Ask only for approval in principle &amp; leave to proceed with detailed scheme. 

Agreed. 

Empress Hall Demonstration 

H.O. Mtg. discussed previously. Inside control by Communist Party. 

250 C.D. workers in uniform asked for – diff. for me to refuse, as Coldstream Guards Band &amp; the L.P.S. are going. 

But for future, shd. Cab. decide tht. Mil or C.D. formns shd. not attend functions unless organised by State or la. or for charity. 

W.O. We asked F.O. and they said they were in favour. 

P.M. This was political issue and shd. have bn. dealt with betwn. Ministers. 

L.P.S. Or, better still, organise this sort of thing ourselves. 

P.M. Important thing is to make it clear tht close relations with Russia does not involve coddling our Communists. 

This ques to be considered by War Cabinet – H.O. being present. 

Message to the Mtg. Agreed. L.P.S. is going representing the Govt but no need for other Ministers to send messages.
