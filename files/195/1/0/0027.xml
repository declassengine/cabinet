Directing A.T.S. to Searchlight Duties. Part heard.

M/L Anticipated Parly. diffies.

K.W x/ Do it now : and announce it by Ques when Parlt. re-assembles. Sept. 8.

M/L. Thought this wd. cause trouble.

K.W Then you’ll have to wait till 8/9.

L.P. H.O. are directing women to fire-watching, wh. is more dangerous.

L.P.S. Surely no trouble over this.

Agreed as at x/.

W.O. then indicated tht. only small no. wd. be affected betwn. now &amp; Sept. because intake now small.

S/Doms. Then can’t we wait until Sept?

W.O. None will be on the job by then – tho’ some may be being trained.

Liquor Policy in W.Africa

C.O. Better to distil good stuff than sit back and watch growth of traffic in “hooch”.

Diffy. is Convention. But its object was to ensure that they get good gin and not too much of it.

M/L. Wdn’t mind if it were a State monopoly.

C.O. Willing to put that to Govrs. If it all must be done by Govt. action.

A.E. Willing tht. Convention shd. be breached temporarily.

Halifax. U.S. were signatories. Will F.O. tell them the reasons?

A.E. I will tell all the respectable signatories.

Find out what French and Belgians and Portuguese are doing about this : and then try to concert a common policy.

S/Doms. S. African gin?

104

C.O. v. high class : not potath by W. Africans : no interference now with their importing it, but they can only sell it to Europeans and the v. richest W. Africans.

Nash. You cd. keep inside the Convention if you manufactured outside W. Africa and imported it. E.g. if S. Africa were willing to distil a cheaper gin. (Not much enthusiasm for this).

India.

L.S.A. Little offl. news of trouble, save rioting in Bombay Residency. Police only tho’ they used revolvers. Press however report troops called in (Bombay).

Suggd. to Govt/India limitation on cables to U.K. – detailed stuff. War Cab thought might be applied also to U.S.A. L.S.A. invited to suggest further damping down of sensational message.

Halifax. Balance of evils. Dang to give impn. in U.S. tht. we are hushing up.

Cdn’t Govt/India damp them down by persuasion.

Imperial Conference – War Conference

S/Doms. Telegram fr. P.M. tht. Smuts likely to come here early Sept. : suggest therefore Imp War Cab. discussions, and get Curtin etc.

All Dom. P.M.’s.

Nash. Fraser will be in U.S.A. next week. Buit has to return N.Z. 16/9. to open Parlt.

Possible tht. opening might be deferred.

Bruce. Curtin not intendg. to go to U.S. just yet. But wd. try for this.

S/Doms. Will wire all P.M.’s suggesting early Sept.

L.S.A. Two Indian repves. due 8-10th Sept.

U.S. Forces.

L.P.S. What is being done about social side?

M/Inf. All Vol Socies. under one hat. Likely to get sensible organion. going before Winter.

They will segregate blacks. Contingents of negresses comg. to care for them.

Under weigh – tho’ late in the day.

105

W.O. F. Stewart at work on some of this. M/Inf. asked to get into touch with him.

M/Inf. Liaison with W.O. and Air Miny. will be arranged.

M/Inf to refer to L.P. if he finds diffies.

Diffies. about black troops. M/Inf. feared still more wd. come (up to 200,000).

Bruce undertook to ask experience of black troops in Australia.

India. Gandhi.

L.S.A. Viceroy consulted Govrs. on W. Cab. view. Their views (with one exception) are strongly against allowg. G. to starve to death.

L.P. Don’t talk about jail. When in prison clear oblign. on govrs officers etc. to look after. When under detention, oblin. is v. different.

L.S.A. Punjab - favours release when dangerous.

Bihar - less bitter if he dies outside.

Bombay - grave polit. blunder to let him die in detentn. In Bombay we shd. then have few friends in any class of community.

C.P. Local reactions most unfavourable – no friends in India.

Hartley (vice Wavell) No effect on Moslems. Some on Hindu o.ranks. The offr. class as a whole wd. be v. critical.

Assam. Similar view.

Sindh. Only one to take opposite view.

Viceroy “can’t disregard this unanimity of Govrs. Attach part. importce to Lumley’s view”.

W.O. Viceroy told us everyone was against deportn. Hallett’s telegram shows not only tht. he favours deportn, but also tht. he was not consulted on that point. H. being one of the few Govrs. who has had experience of Civil disstbce

Halifax. Wd. have no doubt myself tht. it wd. be mistake to let him die in detentn.

Whatever the disadvantages of letting him out, his death in detentn wd. be worse.

L.S.A. Wd. like to wait for Viceroy’s final opinion.

106

L.P. What you must do is to prevent G. fr. carrying on his campaign. Therefore no greater degree of detentn. than is necessary for that purpose. Shd. be possible to devise some method of detentn. wh., while securing that object, will leave on others the responsibility for his health etc. And much to be said for arranging that now – before he starts to hunger strike – at least don’t wait till he is so ill that he has to be moved.

W.O. I wd. leave him to die where he is – i.e. at Poona where he is in a Palace not a prison.

S.Doms. It is up to Viceroy to tell us how he proposes to meet the L.P’s condition.

Put that condition to him and ask him how he will meet it.
