P.M. Ok but let us see beforehand what you will say.

Manacling of Prisoners of War

W.O. 240 G. warned 9.a.m to be manacled 12 noon.

Cruwell protested and asked to see Preiswerk – who was produced before noon. He said order must have bn. given by Hitler in person. Found however had eczema in wrists and hasn’t bn-tied. Sick asked to be chained with comrades.

Handcuffs with 1ft. chains. Chained 9 a.m-9 p.m.

Telegram fr. Ottawa : resistance to shackling order. 400 only chained so far. Some injured. Enforcement in Ozada Camp wd. add to rioting. Cd. Swiss find out wthr. Canadians have visited and wthr. force had been used. Shd. we ask this ques?

L.P.S. Ask for informn. about condns. etc. of shackling and add incidentally “has there bn. any trouble over it in camps”.

L.P. Won’t that prompt Germans to make same enquiry?

P.M. Wait – until Canada has recd. our telegram, anyhow. Wait for next move.

160

Cranb. In favour – but what effect on Mackenzie King and others. Will they be affronted if they aren’t asked when they come?

P.M. Smuts is unique. Age : mil.rank : Dom. P.M. who has fought against us: and only [one who was in War Cab. in last war.] Let him do it as [ ].

Ch.Whip. Royal Gallery can take 700 chairs.

L.P.S. Adjourn House at 4.30 for it – some day before 22/10.

Announce arrangements Thursday (Secret Session) if possible.

Agreed : Ch. Whip to arrange in consultn. with L.P.

U.S. Coloured Troops in U.K.

P.M. Views of U.S. Army must be considered.

Nothing to stand betwn. U.S. offr. and his troops : we mustn’t interfere.

H.O. I accept that. What I won’t have is B. Police enforcing their rules for them.

W.O. Eisenhowers instns are disingenuous – prescribes M. Roosevelt’s doctrines as principles but adds rules of practice which have opposite result.

M/L. Against written instructions.

W.O. So am I. The S. Command instn. has “leaked”, beyond those to whom issued.

We won’t segregate or discriminate in our canteens.

Publish in ABO (for offrs. only) article on history of problem.

Other recommendations in end of memo.

Post-war Anglo. Am. relations will depend on relations wh. we establish now with U.S. Army in this country.

Ld.Ch. Test this. a) Victoria Stn. Canteen. If we conform to U.S. attitude then at this Canteen coloured troops can’t be served.

W.O. But see my proposal not App. – we won’t discriminate in our canteens.

b) Effect on our coloured people.

161

I think the statement by L.P.S. is v. nearly right.

What I can’t accept is W.O. suggn. tht. we shd. conform to U.S. attitude eg – in last sentence of memo.

W.O. I wd. modify this statement.

S/S.Air. Avoid “coloured”. The U.S. prefer to call them “American negroes”.

W.O. We agree : a) if any segregn. U.S. must do it not us. Their responsibility. b) Explain U.S. attitude and ask our people to pay attention to it. c) There shd. be a good deal of reserve in attitude of our troops, particularly to negroes.

M/L. Educate them yes : but don’t try to educate them into U.S. prejudices.

W.O. Cranborne advocates no guidance at all. H.O. advocate not giving even information.

S/Air. Education unsafe unless you include references to our attitude to coloured people.

Cranb. Difft. in “not too matey” principle : because we have nos. of coloured people here. eg coloured Canadians. Change of policy.

Educate both ways : both Americans and British in view of the other : and then leave it to common sense.

If it can be said we have advocated “colour bar” all the coloured people here fr. our Empire will go back discontented and preach disaffection there.

H.O. With v. small amendment wd. support L.P.S. memo.

W.O. Referred to instns. issued by Eisenhower : guidance about our views.

Cadogan. Eden accepted W.O. memo – save for wording of last phrase of all. Suggd. “adopt …………. so far as may be possible w’out practising unfair or objectionable discrimination”

P.M. L.P.S. document is better than any other. Let L.P.S. (with W.O. H.O.) settle any amendments : and then consider how and to what extent it shd. be published. Objective – a document tht. can go down as far as Col.s of Regts.

L.P.S. Also to scrutinise the article for A.B.C.A. magazine.

Armistice Day.

162

a) As last year. b) Parlt. if meets that day to open at noon.
