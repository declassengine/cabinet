W.M.(42) 48th Meeting 14th April 1942 

I. Release of Whole-time C.D. Personnel for War Industry. 

H.O Element of risk – but need for offensive spirit. 

Aim – 30% C.D. Gnrl Services to be released. 

Fire Service. Specl. recruitment stopped – induction 1/6th. 

Police. Release men under 25. 7.000 in all. 

S/Doms How can they return quickly if blitz resumed? 

H.O. Oblign. is give part time service – this is main substitute in ordinary times. Recall in blitz. Diffy. is highest nos in Ldn. Region &amp; many of these may have to go long way off. Some days to get them back. Risk – but offset by power to require others to give part-time service. 

Part of N.F.S. being segregated to do own motor repairs. 

T.J. Still short of N.F.S. in Scotland. Need 850 more full time for minimum standard on major pumps. Agree with proposals subject to being allowed to recruit these. 

Agreed. 

II. Anti-Gas Precautions. 

S/Doms No good running intermittent stunts. No case therefore unless ready to keep up all round. 

Need however to ensure respiration in good condn. 

L.P. a) Better prepd. than in Germany? 

b) True that G. have new resicant gas? 

H.O. Rumours on b) – told sometime ago it was o.k. 

L.P. Enquiry to be made – homologue of mustard gas : much more volatile &amp; therefore more pervasive. Not suggested, respirators not good v. it. But it wd. be first case of blister gas wh. is volatile. Need, if true, to review our preparations. 

S/Doms On a) Mily. said G. as well equipped as we in anti-gas prepns. Italians are not so well prepared. 

S/Doms Agreed to get authentic reports on a) ) 

) Agreed 

6 

“ “ “ “ “ “ b) ) 

H.O. Tho’ we are reasonably well prepared, we must expect that at beginning of gas attack there will be teething troubles and confusion. 

M/Supply afraid of relaxation of precautions in manufg. plants. 

Suggested special warning (S/Doms). 

S.Doms Laundries. M/L I have scheduled them. 

M/H On “my” point (i.e. prices) this is with W.O. not me. 

I am concerned only with civilian decontamination. The W.O. are negotiating with the laundries and the negns. are now in last stage. Results expected in 2 weeks. S/Doms. We shall have to put an order on them if we can’t get them into line v. soon. 

S/Doms to report in a week. 

III. Political Meetings in Factories. 

L.P. Summarised memo. General agreement by Dpts primarily concerned. 

New rule wd. not prevent informal gatherings to be addressed by repres. of managements or T. Unions. 

Admry. Diffy. about “political” mtgs – Shop Stewards returning fr. national gathering &amp; holdg. mtgs. 

Agreed. 

IV. Supplies to Russia. 

[M/P. Hopkins &amp; Harriman pressed for prelim. study to find out prob. ceiling for supplies to Russia. We might get finality on limit of capacity to convoy &amp; protect. This wd. be one stable element. Having got that, decide tank &amp; aircraft figure, get monthly figure of free space &amp; ask Russians how they want it used. 

This may throw into relief diffics of dealing with this on Protocol basis. 

S/S. Air. Will this mean any increase on present quantities? V. doubtful.] 

F.O. Americans not anxious for conf. in Moscow. Wd. prefer tht. U.S and we shd. decide inter nos what we can send and tell Russians this is all we can manage. 

Agree each discussion with U.S. people – on what level? 

Agreed with Hopkins no commn to Russia till we had agreed inter nos. 

Prepare our posn not only qua prodn. but also qua protection. 

7 

M/P. This is being done now by my people – in touch with M/W.T. &amp; Admy. 

F.O. This must be a joint ceiling for U.S. &amp; our supplies – even tho’ we have to do all the conveying. 

M/W.T. We see no chance of continuing to convoy the numbers wh. U.S. are laying on. 

1st Sea Lord. 25 ships in each of 2 convoys a month – is our present estimate. But our experience of s. heavy escorts now accompanying present convoys will teach us something. Weight U Boat attack now near U.S. coast. 

S/Doms. Estimate of R. Production and needs? 

M/W.T. 4/5ths of the 40 U.S. ships a month are carrying non Protocol material. The U.S. are laying on ships for the sake of it and we have to provide the convoy. The lack of lifting capacity on these ships means they can’t lift the tanks &amp; for this reason they are loading food &amp; other material wh. R. need less. 

M.A.P. 14-16 ships a month have fulfilled our part of the Protocol. 

40 a month fr. U.S. will go well beyond their part of the Protocol. 

M.W.T. This 40 a month is at our expense – some are our ships. 

Not so far the result of joint discussions. 

M/P. We can’t get informtn about R. needs w’out disclosing our strategic plans : and we shall tell the truth and they won’t! 

1st Lord. Experience suggests we must expect to lose 20% of merchant tonnage used in each journey. And havg. to cover the convoy by major naval units involves v. large measure of risk to UK. 

S/Doms. Continuance of specific commitment ties our hands elsewhere. And we don’t know how far it takes precedence over all other needs – even in new situations. 

M/P. See where we get to on basis of convoy limitations – what is a reasonable rate fr. Admy. point of view. But if they answer 50 ships a month – then this wd. carry the Protocol + the 50% promised – and perhaps more. So it wouldn’t much help. 

1st Sea Lord. We cd. give better protectn. to 1 convoy of 25 ships p. month. 

This wd. half the risk to the Home Fleet (cut 7 days vice 14 p. month). 

8 

S/Doms. Complete study initiated by M/Prodn. &amp; W. Cab. consider it again. 

F.O. S/S War suggested linking this with negotiations on Treaty. Generally agreed preferable to keep them separate. 

Agreed – consider next week; and tell Americans meanwhile what we are doing.
