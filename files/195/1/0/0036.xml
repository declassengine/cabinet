Stalingrad area. V. intense.

Grozny. Attacks mainly held.

In the passes – some progress in most westerly pass. Shd. be freezing up now.

Capture of Novorossisk – most serious event of week (if G. claim true) because it wd. enable them to supply fr. Crimea.

P.M. Statements by Litvinov in U.S.? Worth while to ask the Russians to put a muzzle on him. F.O. to consider (doubtful.)

Foreign Affairs.

Extra territoriality in China.

A.E. In spring set review on foot. Seymour thought no time to discuss future. (because our stock so low). U.S. agreed. U.S. now wd. like to take it up – leavg. Treaties affecting our post-war trade.

Trade agreements to stand over till after the war. We agree : and glad U.S. have approached us. We stand to gain if we move with U.S. rather than alone.

Will circulate details. But do War Cab. agree in principle. Yes.

Turkey.

A.E. Waitg. C.O.S. Rpt. on supplies (C.O.S. tomorrow).

139

Operational training of Turkish pilots. P.M. Enquired. But the training covers the whole range of Fighter Control – and we know tht. some G. spies included among the pilots. Air Miny. will now give them a modified system of operational training.

S/Air. Wd. like to tell Ambassador as he had to refuse him before. Agreed.

P.M. May be able to spare some tanks for Turkey if Libya is cleared up satisfactorily.

W.O. to look into it. 2 pdr. guns also.

Russia.

Maisky – troubled by recent advance on mobility of Armies. Lorries to take precedence therefore over tanks in our convoys. We’ll do this.

Transport aircraft also. Said, however, that we haven’t any. Asked about U.S. output.

No record.

P.M. Preparation of another P.Q. Convoy – will have to be considered by

* smaller mtg. W’in the next week.

de Gaulle. Syria receives subsidy from us. Propose to hold it up – as pressure.

Air Raid Damage.

H.O. Small attacks. Main diffies. as in C.A.S. statement. Casualties not heavy.

India: Detention of Gandhi.

L.S.A. Visitors – bond as in telegram.

Asked object – otherwise unlikely to get A. to play.

Wd. ask Viceroy to reduce visitors to minimum.

Meantime no indication tht. he will fast.

W.O. Doubtful about visit in principle : danger of communication esp. with Japs.

Agreed – subject to caution to Viceroy about not going too far.

M/L. Have you telegraphed Viceroy about social policy.

140

L.S.A. Yes. I’ve written. But we can do it in s.93 Provinces.

M/L. But was there not an understanding tht. protection legn. not be introduced while interim Govt. in force?

L.S.A. Something like that.

M/L. But 3 years have passed. We really shd. act on this now. Arcas being industrialised.

Publication of Documents.

F.O. As in memo.

We ought to put out documents now and damaging our interests by not doing so. If not, at least prepare for publicn. and release at appropriate moment.

K.W. Weight and size. Not 20 people will read them. Only damaging excerpts will be published.

A.E. Also a shorter document prepd. wh. will sell.

S/Doms. No reason why shdn’t be published.

M/Inf. At least prepare for publicn.

H.J. Wd. not object to publicn. now of the shorter edition.

Simon. I did read them, at yr. request, and I made a report. No v. decided line – but what advantage will be gained? They show up G. as unreasonable and treacherous – but all know that. On other hand, the material is offered for those critics who want to pick out damaging documents.

L.P.S. Opinion in U.S. is the most important considn. This will provide the material for those who wish to support us.

Report for publicn. (incldg. short version).

Cabinet authy. for issue to be obtained.
