Air Service to to M/East.

P.M. Everyone wants better services, but what is the cost?

C. V. old problem – Nov ’41 – Air Miny. were doing their best

(from 12.000lb. a month April ‘42

16.000lb. Sept etc.

When 14.000 lbs total, G.P.O. wanted 7.000 lbs. Serv. dpts. said impossible

Failing agreement. asked C.O.S. to fix priorities – they preferred urgent freight to mails.

S/Air. Promised 14.000 to end Aug. and then 16.000.

Average already 16.500 in last weeks – in spite of great diffiies.

Boeings and Whitleys.

Better than our promise already. But wd. like to do still more. Recognises morale point.

Now considering (a) taking 1 Sunderland from production a month (out of 7 a month) for 6 months beginning Oct.

(b) (reluctantly) taking Warwicks (6000 lbs. for 800 mile range) – 10/12 might be provided – at expense of Bomber Command. 2/3 in Sept rising to 10/12 over next few months.

Result: from 16.500 – increase by 10.000 by end of year.

P.M.G. Substantial increase in aircraft capacity – already – but no increase in allocation of space for mails. That static for 2 years. Thin p.c. + airgraph not enough in view of Commrs. Demand for sealed air letter (bd. a time). But I need 6.000 lbs. to start it. No prospect, not only of gettg. that, but even of maintg. p.c.s &amp; airgraphs.

4.000 lbs. had recently to go by sea to W. Africa and then on by air.

1.500 lbs. will have to go in end Aug.

Army grows and little chance of maintaining exisg. facilities, still less provide more.

Feb ’42 p.c. load = 953 lbs. a week) Due to increase in Army

Last week “ = 3.106 “ “ ) strengths

132

M/L. If capacity is to be raised by 10.000 lbs. can’t you get some of yr. extra 6.000 lbs?

W.O. But he must have a large and steady allotment before he can start a new venture.

P.M.G. More than allocation – absolute shortage of capacity. I can’t ask for priority over tank spares.

S/Air. We can put extra stuff on for special crises for eg. tank spares.

P.M. Matter of high military importance to ensure that the Army gets its letters.

Let Coastal Command and Bomber Command (1:2) provide the aircraft needed.

Morale of that Army must be maintained.

A.V.A. Crises of U-Boat war a bad time for me to give up even one more aircraft.

P.M. See what can be done. And remember this is a military objective. The men’s minds are more important than their bodies.

Reading matter (by sea).

P.M.G. I want 6.000 lbs. a week on a definite basis.

S/Air. I accept that ruling – if we can work up fr. Oct. onwards.

P.M. (1) Mandate to produce a scheme for 6.000 lbs. a week to start in a month. If the cost is shown to be too great, we’ll re-consider. But vital military objective.

(2) W.O. to submit scheme for reading matter. Incldg. re-printing in Cairo.
