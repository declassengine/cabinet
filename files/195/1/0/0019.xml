W.M.(42)89th Meeting 9th July 1942.

I Post-war relief

P.M. As in his memo. Parlt. &amp; the nation shd. know before we bind ourselves to such a far reaching commitment.

F.O. We say only (1) there will be a system of rationing after the war.

We shall then be dependent on U.S. They intend to continue lease-lend.

P.M. We shall then have greatest home production over.

K.W. Gratuitous offer. Posn. same as regards stocks.

F.O. Disagreed as rgds stocks. Ty. policy is now what is was when it provoked this war.

K.W. Don’t bind ourselves now. See how we stand then.

M/P. Stocks. Ques.is whtr. we shall do better by putting ours into pool with U.S.A. or by selling them against gold.

M/L. How will you get order when the chaos is on us unless we begin to plan now.

Not afraid of promise – so long as we don’t bind ourselves to any specific level of rationing.

There must be orderly relaxation after the war: we must therefore let people begin to plan it now.

P.M. We can’t tie our people up in this suffering – bureaucratic machinery.

Halifax. If there are starving people in the countries wh. we have fought to liberate, wd. our people hesitate to accept rationing in their interest.

Anyhow you will have to do it in any event.

We’ll have to live on U.S. charity for some time after the war. And this sort of thinking is the only contribution we can make to international relief after the war.

S/Doms. Position is tht,. we are saying now tht. after war we shan’t immediately scrap all control &amp; engage in unregulated scramble. We will maintain a system of rationing, to control the position.

P.M. Canada cd. supply us if we needed it.

74

M/L. Yes – as after the last war. And 2-3m. unemployed followed.

F.O. For some yrs. after the war there will not be enough food or shipping to allow us to revert to system of winning food by sale of goods. We shall have to continue a system of rationing.

P.M. At the end of this war I will submit to no inequality with U.S.

B/T. Our proposal is consistent with your minute. Quoted from Annex.

Our standard of living will remain, for all this, above that of European countries.

B/T. advise tht. in any event we shall have to maintain rationing for some years after the war.

M/W.T. Shipping. By end of ’43 U.S. will have more shipping than B. + B – controlled.

L.P.S. We want a plan to be made for relief. What other contribution can we make.

And if we make it, we shall be protecting ourselves from being put on a level with other “distressed” countries.

M/P. Textiles. After war there will be no stocks of clothing in Europe at all. Unless you maintain rationing for 2 yrs or so, the prices will go so high tht. the poor won’t be able to buy a shirt.

Halifax. U.S. will be supplying most of the food etc. That will mean v. heavy taxation. That will be their contribution.

P.M. If we contribute, let our people do so as a generous gift.

S/S.Air European Allies are working out relief plans for their countries which contemplate rationing. In Washington they are bound to ask what we are going to do.

F.O. The Allied Govts are already trying to buy and to collar the shipping. We must avoid this competition scrambling.

M/L. I favour this because I believe the poor will get a better chance that way in the period immediately after the war.

Jowitt. This means only – some system of orderly distribn. to avoid waste. We can’t give much in the way of food. We say therefore tht. we won’t indulge in plenty while the rest of Europe is starving.

F.O. The whole thing is governed by “as part of a common plan”. We are not committed unless we like the plan.

75

L.P.S. Referred to P.M.’s statement of June 1940. This implies that we are going to do something to build up supplies. K.W. is now saying don’t do anything about it now.

P.M. Position has deteriorated since then.

L.P.S. If we are going to plan, to enable us to redeem this pledge, we must make some contribution now.

K.W. X/ Let us at least avoid public declaration at this stage, until we have seen the common plan.

M/L. Favoured X/. So long as L. Ross knows where he is.

K.W. Can we agree to ( a) enter into no commitment

y/ instruct L. Ross on ( b) see tht. no publn. of this

these lines ( c) make it clear that when we see the plan

( as a whole we will make up our mind.

M/W.T. We have no assurance of getting a share post-war of the surplus of U.S. shipping.

K.W. Further telegram to L. Ross – in light of further discussion in Cabinet – to effect of y/.

P.M. Remained of opinion that we shd. not do this unless U.S. equally find themselves to equal rationing.

Let K.W. prepare a draft telegram &amp; bring it to the War Cabinet.

( [ Also ? need to consult Ministers about the line.]

( in consultn. with F.O. and B/Trade.
