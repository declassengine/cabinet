W.M.(42)98th Meeting 28th July, 1942.

The Shipping Situation

L.P. Repns. to U.S.A. at least 3 m. tons of imports in first half of ’43.

Even so factors up rep large margin of error – a) sinkings b) military demands c) Bolero.

A.E. As in P.M.’s memo. Base demand on full employment of our seamen.

M/W.T. Wd. prefer to put it quantitatively first.

In Bolero negotiations I am seekg. assistance 500.000 tons gross shipping in first 9 months – 1.7.42-31.3.43 and 1.500.000 tons 1.4.43-31.12.43 wh. wd. give us margin. [Hope thus to get 7-7½ m.tons imports additional over period of 18 months]

25 m. = 1942 : 27 m. = 1943.

L.P. This is a diff. method of bridging the same gap.

M/W.T. Cherwell now wants 28 vice27.

P.M. I said to President “27 or 28”. Stand by that.

M/W.T. 5.000.000 gross t. shipping additional in first phase: and up to 1.5 m. at end of 9 mos for second phase.

This is what I am asking Americans for.

If we get this help on Bolero, we shall benefit by repercussion.

1.3 gross tons remain as contribn. twds. Bolero.

We now found we can ship less than ½ of U.S. original demands for Bolero.

Even if they reduce their scales fr. 9 tons to 6 tons p.mon we can’t do it.

Sinkings in first 9 mos estimated on first 6 mos of 1942 less 25%.

Turn-round. Less good because military stores. 4 voyages vice 4.7.

Better to have this ½ m. &amp; 1½ m. in the 29 mos. &amp; get [ ] extra imports.

P.M. Bolero is subject to delay – fixed for April but cd. be put back.

84

M/W.T. Estimates raised on 23 m. U.S. bldg. programme. Tho’ M/P. more optimistic, their programme has since bn. cut. Cd. we help them with steel?

M/P. Not if we have to cut ourselves.

P.M. Let 25 &amp; 27 m. be fixed figures - &amp; Bolero variable, in time. Bolero must carry any contingencies – e.g. from sinkings.

Consumption Economies

Rationing bread.

P.M. Why not? c.f. great waste.

Hens – new regulation will mean tht. people will feed them bread.

M/F. Rationing means equal distribn. to all. Important to preserve one commodity free for ironing out personal inequalities. Bread mops up individuals’ variation. Fill up on bread.

Doubt how much waste of bread there is – don’t believe there is much. Wd. rather risk that than risk people going hungry.

Differential – v. difficult.

I can save 800.000 tons of shipping without rationing bread.

P.M. But a) will stop waste b) saving in tonnage c) bargaining point with U.S.A.

M/F. Straight rationing of bread wd. increase consumption.

Points wd. help that – but wd. involve loss of variety

And burden wd. fall most heavily on heavy workers, whose need for bread is greatest.

P. M. You might save 500.000 t. imports by this means.

Agreed – L.P.Cttee to re-consider. Not worth doing unless it brings ½ m. tons.

Dilution.

Agreed : as in L.P.Cttee conclusions.

[Waste of Potatoes. New machinery for reducing to a minimum.]

U.S. Army Requirements. What scales are U.S. Army working on? Prob. excessive.

85

M/P. Said his people were looking into these points - &amp; working them out.

M/P. Press them to use our equipment &amp; ship their’s direct to theatres of War.

P.M. Waste of space by Services in shipping space allocated to them.

Cherwell. 1.100 vehicles boxed in April = 80.000 tons saved.

1.460 “ “ “ May = 100.000 “ “

No ships reqrd. is defined by no. of vehicles – their search round for cargo.

Shocking waste of space in past: position is now much improved.

Scale of equipment for M.T.

S.S War. Promise of 20-30% reduction – now come down to 10-12% in view of change in role of Army.

P.M. Circulate to those concerned the Cttee’s Rpt. recd. in W.O. today.

P.M. Only way of getting results here is to impose over-all cuts or let Dpts

work out how they will operate them.

We can’t press U.S. to cut down w’out doing it ourselves.

Services have bn. completely uncombed for man-power. Need for searching enquiry into use of man-power by R.A.F. &amp; Army. Service Ministers must help.

S/Air. We’ve tried hard. But new strategic demands – swinging Air Forces from one threat to another

A.E. Wastage rates (sick) v. high in M/East &amp; India.

P.M. We must lighten our establishments for overseas service.

A.V.A. We ought to have a go at it – it had to be done in 1917 &amp; again in 1918.

M/L. You will have to do it if you expect production to keep in step.

Need for co-opern. not opposition. Everyone says what can’t be done.

M/L. You call up only Grades 1 &amp; 2. Yet you use them on “tail” at 1 : 1 Army. 60 : 1 R.A.F.

86

That is surely a waste of fit men.

I can only ring the changes on priorities.

W.O. Taking troops abroad will mean an increase of our tail – not a decrease

P.M. Women drivers on home service?

W.O. We can’t get enough women.

And can they be directed into searchlights?

P.M. Yes. This doesn’t involve use of lethal weapons.

Phosphates.

M/Ag. Now has to come fr. Gulf. We are now 2 mos. short. because U-Boats off U.S. coast.

If we have sinkings, then we shan’t be able to keep factories going after June.

40.000 tons must be moved in winter : and this is v. unlikely.

Apatite fr. N. Russia is off!

We haven’t enough in country to last beyond Christmas.

M/Prodn. is helping me with this : and I can wait for 2 weeks.

Tractors

L.P. There is a plan for pooling them as between. W.O. and M/Ag. Total to

co-ordinate.

P.M. Let us have a memo. for Cabinet on this (? Not persist in this request).

L.P. Facilities for service &amp; repair can also be improved by pooling.

P.M. This was explanatory.

But - a) Bolero = vsid. legatee

b) 25 &amp; 27 for 42 &amp; 43 are firm.

c) F.O. to focus repns. to U.S.A. for firm guarantee as to shipping required to meet b)

d) Economies – L.P. recommendns. appd.

87

e) Bread rationing – L.P.Cttee to consider.

f) Service man-power – Cab.Cttee. S/Doms. L.P.S. &amp; F.O. R.A.F. and Army

Comb tail and sharpen teeth. Beach Divns. to be made fully effective.

g) Vehicular economies. Report to come to Cabinet.

h) Packing of vehicles.

W.O. May cttee on (f) proceed in such a way as will not involve detailed scrutiny of past establishments.

P.M. has held one review already.

Only way to do it is to fix global figure &amp; let Army work out details.

S/Doms. Food supplies of expeditionary Force shd. be as far as possible dried etc.

L.P.S. Other aspects for discussion -

Shipbuilding in this country.

Anti-U-Boat campaign.

A.V.A. Admy. have bn thro’ this problem of concrete ship or other variant for economical bldg.

M/L. Civil engineers shd. be allowed to try.

P.M. M/W.T. to obtain report fr. U.S.A. on their new methods of bldg.

M/L. T.L.C.’s being built like 1st class ships: not “rough &amp; readies.”

Super accommodn. on crews quarters – too much amenity.

P.M. Let Cab. have a memo. on this – W.O. &amp; Admy. in consultn.
