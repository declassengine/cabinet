W.M.(42)117th Meeting 24th August 1942.

P.M’s Journey.

S/Doms. Announced P.M.’s return. No one to be told until arrival in U.K. Then other Ministers, High Commrs. Winant and Maisky. In advance War Cabinet : C.O.S.

I India.

L.S.A. Unoffl. advisers in s.93 Provinces.

Latest telegram 2558-5.

Hence not worth discussing all Govr’s views known. Agreed.

Tendency to suggest Govr. Genl. in Council shd. exercise greater influence in Provinces.

Undesirable to encroach on Prov. autonomy in name of Indianisation.

Assam will now return to democratic govt.

General Situation.

Looks better. Even in Bihar (now the only centre of trouble) improvement in most parts – tho’ still anxiety in some areas.

Loyalty of Police (except in Bihar) striking.

S/Doms. 5th Column not Congress?

L.S.A. Telegram – some movements unlike Congress inspired. May be engineered by forces directly by enemy. Money behind it – prominence of students – (tho’ Moslem students have held aloof).

M/L. Need for labour policy for India in present stage. Political strikes because only people organising labour are politicians. Standard of life too low for state of production. Viceoy shd. consider development of social, industrial policy for India.

eg. Indian seamen : paid less than Chinese. Obstacle to improvement = big business in India. Insurance contributions paid into pool for B. Seamen : if they wd. run an Indian scheme, we cd. let them have the contribns. in respect of labour.

L.S.A. On seamen, M/L. M/W/T. and I.0. considering posn. now – hope something will emerge.

L.P.S. A good man shd. be sent out to India.

128

M/L. Looking into that now.

S/Doms. Cabinet to have a report on progress.

Gandhi

L.P. Viceroy in recent telegram S. – strongly in favour of letting G. starve to death : + added all Moslem members of Council wd. take same view. Yet at the same time decision we were assured that all opinion was solid against that.

This was a relevant point on wh. Cab shd. have had information at the time. We are told now: but not told at the time of decision.

Gave us a partial opinion – without telling us it was a partial opinion. Disturbing.

L.P. Intelligence in India shd. be able to find out whtr. anything more behind the disorders – eg. attempt to cut Bihar off. Important that, if this is so, we should show it up and make full use of it.

II Machinery of Government.

L.P.S. Re-consider in light of war experience and post-war needs.

Small cttee – L.P. in Chair – co-opting as necessary - report to Cabinet and decide then whether publication is advisable.

K.W. “Other central authies.” in + t of r.

L.P.S. Semi-Govt. Dpts : not local govt. except in relation to central govt.

S/Doms. Civil Service.

L.P.S. Yes. “machinery and management.”

M/L. Distribution of functions?

L.P.S. Yes

L.P. Haldane Cttee procedure inappropriate for domestic ques. such eg as super Ministers.

Hence liberty to call in outsiders but not giving them responsibility and not necessarily publish all the results.

Merits - agreed.

Procedure - agreed better to do it “domestically”. Against “outside” bodies.

129

Too much work?

L.P. Slowly : and skilled Secretariat.

Method in memo. agreed. Personnel to be decided by P.M. Either 3 or 5 : smaller the better.

II Parliamentary Business.

S/Doms. Shd. Parlt. meet earlier than 8/9. now that P.M. is back; for statement by him.

General feeling – public content to wait and give P.M. a rest.

Ch.Whip. Heard nothing. Press don’t now expect it. P.M. averse from it. “He wd. have little to add”.

S/Doms. Then hope P.M. won’t broadcast.

Ch.Whip. When return known, put out idea that he shd. have a rest.

Programme – agreed as last year. Meet and sit 1 week : adjourn 2 weeks clear : then clear up outstanding business : and a few days recess before new Session.

IV Foreign Affairs.

A.E. Argentine Amb. visit to-day. Diff. posn. in view of Brazil’s declaration. “If Brazil wants us in they had better ask for our help”. i.e. better way than U.S. bullying us in.
