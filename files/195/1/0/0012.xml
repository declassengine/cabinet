W.M.(42)77th Meeting 18th June 1942 

Air Operations 

C.A.S. Weather – only mining Wed. &amp; Thurs. nights. 

M.E. Convoy. U.S. aircraft did quite well, tho’ nothing like what they claimed in Press. 

They did materially better than over Ploesti oilfields. 

Air losses in M.E. We started ahead &amp; losses so far have bn. equal. 

II. Report of Arrival of American Forces. 

V.C.I.G.S. Leakages – inevitable. Genl. Chaney agrees can’t do more than avoid disclosure of date &amp; place of arrival. 

M/I. Americans main source of leakage. 

Propose to talk to Editors on lines of memo. The date &amp; place of arrival are covered by general D Notice. But will ask for general damping down of publicity. 

Agreed. 

III. Carriage of American Troops in B.Vessels 

M/W.T. Genl. Lee is keen on stepping up the nos. carried – both in large &amp; small ships. If we will sanction it qua. ships, they will adopt it at once qua troops . Ques of public interest so far as large ships concerned. 

1st Lord. Risk of subm. attack not v. great with these large ships. But there is always a chance of an unlucky find &amp; hit. Also signs of increased air attack in W. Approaches. Wd. therefore favour no increase. 

W.O. 120.000 short by March 31st ’43 – this measure wd. reduce the shortage by half. 

H.O. Speed of their arrival will affect civil problems. Unless militarily necessary to get them here as quickly as possible, better to have them in steadily. 

W.O. No phased plan. But Americans want to push them in as fast as they can - &amp; politically P.M. wd. not wish to stand in their way. 

Accommtn will not be a bottleneck. 

M/L. Don’t like idea of 15.000 on these ships. 

47 

L.P. But even 10.000 raises that problem. And it is the Americans who want this. 

M/W.T. Wd. W.O. do it with B. troops? 

Nye. Wd. depend on the operational urgency. We have no comparable problem. But we have stepped up our stowage by 30% for a 2 month journey. 

L.P.S. Cd. we charter the ships to them - &amp; leave the whole responsibility to them. 

M/W.T. It will be under our flag &amp; we shall be responsible. Our flag &amp; our crew – whtr. we “chartered” or not. 

M/L. Difficult to resist if Americans press. 

M/W.T. In the end they put it to us on the basis – wd. the crew mind. 

L.P. This is not a thing we wd. do ourselves. Make this plain to them &amp; say our risk is only the crew &amp; then leave the responsibility to them. Put this in writing. 

W.O. You can say that W.O. wdn’t do this except for reasons of extreme operational urgency. 

Agreed. 

IV. Parliament 

Statement on M.East on Tuesday. Auchinleck to be asked for statement. 

V. Pritt’s offer to lecture to Troops 

W.O. Pritt v. angry at having his offer refused. Threat to make public statement. Propose to let him talk if he wants to. Shall not give him any reasons. 

H.O. The answer is “P. is not a suitable person to address the troops”. Better to keep that answer until extracted from you. 

L.P.S. Disposed to give a reason at once.
