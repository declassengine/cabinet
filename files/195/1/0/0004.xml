6 : 4: 11 in night fighting for loss of 2 )

Admy. establmnt. fair amount damage. 

P.M. Don’t make too much of this in Press – we’re hitting them 3 times as hard – don’t give impression this is quits. H.O. communiqué a bit too sensational. Tone down, &amp; keep in proportion. Don’t give out photos. 

H.O. Dilemma. Don’t make Bath think we are making light of it. 

M/Inf Let Air Miny bulletin keep in step also. 

P.M. M.E.W. say Augsburg not important for Diesel manufacture – and another more important target nearby not touched. 

F.O. Can we not announce targets in advance – no matter how long the list. 

C.A.S. Risks in it. Discourage our crews if they have heavy casualties in attacking a place on the list. Psychological effect. Agreed, however, to examine it again. 

14

480 houses destroyed 5.000 slightly damaged. 

For 2 nights 148 dead (20-30 more likely). 

Water – not serious. Gas – out for week. Electricity – OK 

Rlway – Bath Stn. out of use. Discussions. 

Food supply not v. good. 

Exeter. 

(Dead both raids 41.dead. 16 seriously injured. 53. slightly injured.) 

(For the 3 raids. 60 “ 21 “ “ 36 “ “ ) 

Admy. Sat. 2 offices damaged &amp; one out therefore UXB. 

Sund. Francis Hotel out : Pump Room Hotel partly damaged : no. hutments at Lansdown knocked out. 

Sat. C.D. Services wavered because HQ knocked out. But Admy. P.D. worked well. 

Nos, Admy staff homeless. Thinking of bringing 400-450 staff back to Ldn. to ease homeless situation – integral unit of staff. Not to be done in a hurry. 

H.O. These are Cat. C. cases – and not so well off for shelter. 

P.M. Move some rocket batteries? C.A.S. Will enquire. P.M. 52 deployed + v. mobile. 

C.A.S. Egypt. 5 : 2 against enemy 5 : 3. Enemy conserving. 

Burma. 4 enemy v. 1 + 1 on ground. 

Pacific. Rabaul – Enemy: 33% of bombers &amp; fighters off Darwin. 

15 

Naval. 13 ships on Atlantic. 3 mined E. coast. 101.000 tons for the week, as 

C.N.S. against 236.000 last week. No particular reason – save good luck. 

Marine casualties – 2 lost. 

A.V.A. Weekly figures not always accurate. 46.000 tons reported lost have arrived. 

Italian claims to have sunk one sub. 

P.M. U.S. Navy not doing much. C.N.S. just back from U.S.A. 

C.N.S. Adml. King more frank this time – no secrets from me. A little luxurious in weight of escorts on convoys. They say they are putting all they have got into it. Certainly putting much aircraft into it. On N.E. Coast. 

Worst feature is no convoys in Caribbean until 15/7. 

A.V.A. Odd that they have so few anti-sub. vessels except destroyers. 

P.M. Sinkings figures reflect the fact that traffic suspended over large part of N.E. Coast. But no comfort in that. 

Military. Burma.V. changes save in E. Route up fr. Loykor? – most dang. part of front. 

C.I.G.S. Japs have pushed up the road – advanced 130 miles in 5 days. 6th Chinese Army doesn’t therefore look so good. 

Strength of our forces. No reply to our wire. But we think about 9.000 effectives. + 50 tanks perhaps in action still. 

China. Force facing Russians increased by 3 Divisions. May be first indications of something important. 

Pacific. P.M. Any change that Japs may go S.? C.N.S. Some possibility and U.S. think so. 

Force in Bay of Bengal likely to be used as concentrated force &amp; kept together. 

Libya. Nothing new. P.M. Why don’t we pounce on isolated Italian force? 

Answer – we did: at least they didn’t stay here. 

Russia. No change. Prob. weather. Now not before 15/5 &amp; prob. later. No marked indications of movement at all. 7 or 8 armoured divisions 

16 

“lost” to our intelligence for a few weeks. Move of flak southwards to cover bridges etc., Rlways in south improved too: but believe that done also in North. 

C.A.S. Indications of move twds East in Mediterranean. Those moving fr. Sicily may go part to Russia part to E. Mediterranean. 

P.M. Garrison in Cyprus is weak. 

C.I.G.S. M/East are considering this. 

F.O. Foreign Situations. Hitler’s speech. Apologia for Russian campaign. Looks as tho’ he’s bit nervous, not about Army, but about civilian 

morale. 

Black market in food. Pos. preparg. for a purge. 

Much more of this speech devoted to us, not Russia. 

Russian Convoys. Just seen Ambass. – worried about delay – explained position &amp; said might pos. be able to get 35 in next time. 

P.Q.16. they said. cd. go to Archangel. 

Guadeloupe &amp; Martinique. - trying, without success, to get US to take a stronger line. P.M. Don’t want U.S to break with Vichy. 

II Admiralty Construction Programme. 

A.V.A. 5 cap. ships to replace 5 lost. 

Main state of Fleet 

Carriers. … 

cruisers 58 + 4 by Allies Lost 18. 

destroyers 249 “ 71. but more than made up for losses. 

(31 by air attack alone) 

sub. 80 + 22 Allies. 

Corvettes. 169 + 9 “ 

sloops 37 + 6 “ 

a) Still not proposed to put Lions in, tho’ going on with gun mountings. 

Interim report of Buckmill Cttee on loss of P.of W. &amp; Repulse almost ready. 

17 

Vanguard likely to be ready in 2 years. 

b) Cruisers. 8 in – gun cruisers. prev. appd. Impossible to go on with them. 

Propose to go on instead with middle class. 

c) Destroyers – wd. like more but proposals will fill all available berths. 

Will take 3 months more to build because of increased protection &amp; armament. 

P.M. raised battleships ques – 1 carrier per ship “cruiserkins” 

d) Carriers. 2 bldg. Ask for 4 intermediate carriers – 3 ordered, with Ty concurrence. They will be 28 months or so bldg. – but Nav.Staff asked to go into details to cut out refinements &amp; get down to 21 months. 

P.M. U.S. are bldg 20 carriers. + 80 auxiliaries. 

C.N.S. Many are converted cruiser hulls (8) – small carriers 25 aircraft each. 

P.M. ? Tell them only 2 more in next 4 years. But ours are more often at risk. Will you give us replacements of first 2 or 3 we lose. We cd. build others for them later. 

C.N.S. President now says don’t turn over anything larger than a destroyer but instead take over the duties. Policy and war as supreme naval power. 

P.M. Let me have a draft to write to President. 

e)T.L.C. Sizeable ships. 12½ knots &amp; carry 150 tanks – 150 ft. long. 

P.M. Don’t let them screw them up to the point where you can’t get away. 

A.V.A. a) Speed – b) degaussed – c) crew accommdn. for distances. Requirements of C.O.H. 

P.M. On c) let crew live ashore until ops. begins. 

P.M. Are U.S. makg. any? A.V.A. They are bringing on the short ones – putting larger ones at end of programme. 

M/Prodn. Preparg. memo. on this. Canada can do a lot of small ones – 50ft. 6½ knots Chrysler engines. As soon as these are assembled in our ports they will draw German strength to the West. 

18 

C.I.G.S. We shall need 650 at least : and we are talking only of 450 by May ’43. 

M/L. Work will have to be spread over more yards &amp; simplified. Wd. like to see a quick decision. Hope some work cd. be done in Ldn – so simplify C.D. release problem. Want also to know designed so that we can begin training the men. 

Also can we put some in Severn. 4 Chepstow – ships built opposite in last war. Also Portishead. 

P.M. Cd V. Chiefs look into this &amp; report to Defence Cttee. ? with COH. 

F.O. R. class battleships to stay un-modernised? P.M. Floating coffins. Unsafe to face any modern vessels or air attack. C.N.S. If you increase their armour &amp; add big bulges you will reduce speed to 15 knots : and this wd. reduce their value. As ocean going ships they have 

K.W. No objn. to programme. 

A.V.A. Merchant ship building now proceeding at rate of 1¼ m.gross tons in the year.
