(fighter cover.)

111

A.V.A. Considerable Fleet in Black Sea. Acc. to law, nothg. but to have them interned (if R. don’t destroy them). V. unlikely tht. Turkey wd. connive at breach of law.

Hence best possibility is the swop suggd. in memo.

Submarines might break through.

x/Some months ago we helped them to get 4 out of 5 out. Subject to same condns. they might do same again.

Some tankers might be Fleet oilers. They wd. have to be “turned” into tankers.

A.E. Approach to R. diff because assumes they will lose last bases.

Turks. R. relations not so good now as x/.

Wd. not encourage R. to run warships thro’ because Turk wd. fight. Don’t encourage them even about submarines. Tankers we might try. Merchant ships no diffy.

Wd. like therefore to send telegram to Clark Kerr and tell him to discuss with P.M. Terms of draft read.

Wd. repeat telegram to Hugesson and get his comments on Turkish reactions.

Agreed to remind H. of sale of G. U-Boat to Spaniards.

L.P.S. Shd. telegram give impression tht. we favour internment vice destruction?

If we have a preference, we shd. let C. Kerr know what it is.

Halifax. That depends on estimates of Turkish reactions. Prob. more likely to come in our side than theirs. If so, wd. prefer internment.

A.E. Unless it made an extra temptation to Germans to attack Turkey. Or to demand their surrender of the ships.

Halifax. Say to H. “we’ve come down on side of internment because of our view of likely T. attitude”. Get his views on this.

L.P. If you can’t add para – indicatg. tht. you believe Turkey wdn’t hand over the ships – then are you right in saying internment is better?

A.V.A. Turks wd. surely resist pressure to surrender them.

L.P. They wd. thus put tremendous weapon into G. hands.

112

A.E. Wd. sooner see the ships sunk than being ground of controversy.

Genl. feeling – pref. to sink the warships and run the subs out.

Agreed. Make it clear tht. politically this wd. be easier course.

II French Fleet at Alexandria.

A.E. Disappointed – but agree with conclusion.

Had hoped that the sailors’ mistresses cd. hold the sailors’ attentn. while F. French or Americans got possession of the ships.

S/Doms. Cd Laval’s recent pronouncement be made occasion for protest v. use of w/t for communn. to France.

A.V.A We can’t physically stop them.

A.E. V. uncomfortable position.

L.P. But worst poss. posn. if we do anythg. implying distrust of G.’s honour.

III Shipping Situation.

S/Doms. Conclns. were “provisional”. But action is procdg.; and we cd. regard

these conclns. as final.

L.P. Bread rationing – discussed by L.P. Cttee. who decided against it. Put this on record.

L.P.S. Yes. But keep it under progress Rpt. to Cabinet. Say in 2 weeks’ time incldg. reports on cuts in materials imports

IV India.

S/Doms. L.S.A. thought time not propitious to see Editors because tone improving.

Reason to believe now that trouble is mainly Reuters. Prefer to see them.

Agreed. Easy to deal with them. L.S.A. to see them + or – Bracken.
