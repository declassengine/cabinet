W.M. (42)80th Conclusions 24th June 1942 

I. Debate in H/Commons. 

S/Doms. Labour Party not likely to support any Motion of Censure – but want an enquiry – designed to safeguard future rather than recriminate about past. 

W.O. Material or generalship? 

Whitely First stressed rather than second. 

S/Doms. Diffy. in doing this w’out the Genls. in the Field. 

W.O. On equipment I’m reasonably satisfied tht. on tanks &amp; anti-tank weapons we’re likely to be thro’ our troubles in about 6 mos. time. Arrangements made for production policy in U.S. related to the minimum no. of types etc. 

L.P.S. Say to-morrow – “we propose if Mot. of Censure put down to allot time for that on Wed. &amp; Thurs. If not put down, we will have a debate on salary of M/Defence – with a vote.” 

S/Doms. If W. Milne Motion not put down, unlikely that Labour Party wd. table Motion asking for enquiry. 

P.M. shd. speak on first day – so tht. Labour Party can meet betwn. these 2 days. 

L.P.S. I shd. like P.M. to wind up also, answer criticisms &amp; get the vote. He can speak twice if it is Supply Day. 

S/Doms Developing as personal attack on P.M. important therefore tht. he shd. speak early. 

Cranborne. Danger of takg. it on M/Def. salary is focussing whole attack on P.M. 

Whitely. We wd. put 2 or 3 Votes down, incldg. M/Defence to get the necessary breadth of Debate. 

Cranb. H/Lds. Addison’s Motion Thursday (next week) intends to go for Govt., not generals. Will not press it to a Division. Will not suggest anthg. like Censure Motion. Will ask for enquiry. 

II. The Tank Position in Middle-East. 

M/S. Past history in narrative. 

Hardly does justice to Mech &amp; Aero. Facts are as set out – but cumulative effect does them less than justice. They have done v. good 

53 

work on tanks – tho’ in this part. tank there were faults due to engineering wh. were not tackled early enough. 

For future, organisn keyed up to catch these defects earlier &amp; quicker. Duty of Tank Design Dpt. to follow up complaints &amp; see tht. modifns carried out. 

These old models will always give trouble because engineering skill in original designing was not good enough. 

Cromwell II will be regarded as reliable engineering job from the start. V. difft. matter fr. adapting faulty old designs. We shall then have better tanks than Germans. 

Remember tht. tanks now being used by G. were designed in 1935. i.e. they had this degree of start on us. 

Cromwell I begins late summer. Will be free of this type of defect. 

“ II “ end of ’42. “ “ a really superior article. 

L.P.S. Mar. 41 – Feb. 42 who was Dir. of Tank Design? 

M/S. Durrant. He hadn’t enough staff – he assumed Nuffield’s engineers wd. have bn. at the trials. He still is Director – but is supervised now as he wasn’t then. 

L.P.S. See top p.3. He left simple remedy unapplied for 11 months. 

M/S. Disagreed. Capable of palliative but not remedy w’out fundamental re-design. 

M/P. In fact, it isn’t easy to remedy. 

W/O. And doubtful if it’s right even now. 

L.P.S. Has system of inspn bn. changed? 

M/S. Nothng. much wrong there. Even these defects were mostly not revealed in U.K. – only M/East brght them out. You’d never get prodn if much more inspn. Best test is pre-prodn model – and we’ll get more of that in future. 

M/L. Complaints of excessive inspn met by leaving much to the firm. Was this the cause of these troubles? 

M/S. No. 

L.P.S. Do arrangements at Farnboro’ &amp; Lulworth correspond to those described in memo? The defects found at Lulworth cd. surely have bn. found in the 7 mos. at Farnboro? 

W.O. Many of the defects in tanks disclose themselves after long time. 

M/S These were operational tests – not the sort done at Farnboro’. 

54 

L.P.S. But cdn’t these be done simultaneously with other tests? To avoid this delay. 

S/Doms. No one person who throughout was looking at the tank as a whole rather than a collection of parts each of which has to be tested individually. 

M/S. Right method – now in force – is to test all yr. components before assembly. Trouble was that 

M/P. These things do happen. The American light tank had v. many operational defects of this kind. 

M/S. Originally D/Prodn was responsible for design. When at M/S. earlier I separated them &amp; apptd a D/Research, Development &amp; Design. 

M/L. When under test, are reports taken fr. men themselves? 

M/S. Yes. Soldiers – trained as testers. 

M/L. This is what engineers often do. 

L.P. Design – too highly specialised and too much sub-divided. 

W.O. Crusader wh. is being modified to take 6 pdr. The alterations make it v. difficult &amp; uncomfortable for the men – but quickest way to get the 6 pdr. tank. Recall also circs. after Dunkirk – decision to concentrate on numbers of the only available design. 

M/S. Why was Valentine the only satisfy. tank then? 

W.O. Because it was infantry tank, only type considered pre-war, &amp; worked on by one man in one firm. 

M/S. Lesson of this is – don’t press us, when we’ve got a winner, to rush into prodn before we’ve fully tested them out. Or, if we have to rush it, don’t expect to avoid all these troubles. 

Policy in past has bn. devote full energy to improving existg designs and to go ahead rather more quietly with new designs. 

F.O. Reports on re-conditioned Churchill? 

W.O. Slow - &amp; useless in Egypt. Drinks in sand. 

W.O. Amendments. of wording of App II. Handed in for incorporation. 

Part I of the Report. 

L.P.S. Who failed to pass the informn on? 2nd para. of summary on p. 5. 

55 

W.O. Well known in W.O. only complaint can be tht. W.O. failed to pass it on to Defence Cttee &amp; War Cabinet. 

S/Doms. Last para. in Part I of my Rpt. 

W.O. Point is – wd. Nov. offensive have bn. postponed if more had been known about the German gun. 

M/P. If that is the point, what happened in Nov. We ran Rommel out of Libya. 

S/Doms. But Auchinleck’s statement, as quoted, was not quite correct. 

M/L. Who wd. know of this at W.O.? 

W.O. Telegrams to W.O., copies of which went to P.M. 

M/L. Who at W.O. was responsible for not bringing this specifically to Defence Cttee. 

W.O. When Def. Cttee considers a particular operation, they take the advice of the Commanders on ques whr they feel able to undertake it. 

M/L. This is vital. Controversy in War Cab. about German 4½ pdr. and our 6 pdr. – revealed for first time in War Cabinet. 

{ lack of tank spares. 

This was followed by controversy betwn. B’brook &amp; Margesson. 

The comparisons of strength were put to War Cab. while opns were being considered &amp; at no material time was the danger of the 4½ pdr. G. disclosed to us. 

W.O. Remember tht. Auchinleck wanted the offensive postponed. 

M/P. In the M/East we were prepd to go on, tho’ we knew they had some 4½ pdrs. It was not until after the beginning of the Nov. offensive that it was realised, even in the M/East, that the 4½ pdr. made such a difference. 

W.O. Once informn had gone automatically to P.M. no one in W.O. wd. think it necessary to bring it specifically to the notice of War Cabinet &amp; Def. Cttee. 

S/Doms. The lay members of the War Cab. (or Def. Cttee) shd have all the material facts. 

L.P. 2 points. 1) Telegrams went automatically to P.M. &amp; Jacob. Is 

that sufficient, for purpose of bringing informn as such 

to Def. Cttee. 

56 

2) When this informn came in, the worth of the gun was to be appreciated. It is clear that up to March, tho’ knowing of it, he did not think it so important. 

On 1) I shd. have said tht., if the informn was relevant to a gun under discussion by Def. Cttee, W.O. shd. be responsible for seeing tht. it was brought to the notice of the D. Cttee. 

W.O. What about informn recently given by C.A.S. relative merits of Spitfire &amp; F.W.210. 

F.O. What is clear is tht. no-one here appreciated the significance of the 4½ pdr. G. gun. 

M/L. What I want to ensure is tht. any significant change in relativities is appreciated brought to notice &amp; acted upon. 

W.O. Assurance tht. we have set up an organisation with exactly that duty. 

L.P. There shd. in each Service Dpt. be an organisation responsible for picking up all this informn - appreciatg it, working on it, and in addn considering what circulation this informn shd. be given. 

S/Doms. The significance of the 4½ pdr. was appreciated – because action was taken to counter it. But W.O. evidently did not think it worth while to bring it to the notice of the Def. Cttee. 

M/L. Is specialist treatment &amp; enquiry by experts carried out while operations proceed? 

W.O. Yes. 

M/L. Cd. the appreciations of relativities – weaknesses &amp; strength – be circulated to War Cabinet? 

S/S. Air. Isn’t this the responsibility of the C.G.S. &amp; Ch. of Staffs. 

A.C.I.G.s. Two ques. 1) What informn shd. C.I.G.S. have put to W. Cab. 

2) Had W.O. appreciation bn. difft. wd. probn of 6 pdrs. have gone quicker. 

If C.I.G.S did not put this factor to W. Cab. it was because he didn’t think it was of primary importance. Nothg. wrong with the system. Our judgement may have bn. wrong – and may be again. 

On 2) W.O as matter of course were developg. new weapons. Two on hand : 6 + 17 pdr. Had we realised then the full significance of this factor it wd. have made no differ to rate of prodn. of either of these guns. This as it happens is true. But remember tht. we are always 

57 

workg. to beat the Germans – apart fr. our knowledge of what Germans have. 

S/Doms. Position of W. Cab. Ministers, We are ready to take risks but wd. like to take them with our eyes open. 

M/L. Don’t accept the statement tht. we cdn’t have accelerated the 6 pdr. 

M/S. &amp; W.O. Dissented.
