Manacling of Prisoners of War.

S/Doms. Latest G. communiqué, threatening to manacle 3 times as many B. pris.

Saw Massey and 2 Canadian Ministers and Bruce. Don’t like posn.

a) Ref.ce. shd. have bn. made to Protectg. Power.

b) Subtefuge in our statements.

If this kind of thing is started, no knowing where it may stop.

What response fr. Canada?

Adam. No reply yet.

We thought this wd. bring G. to their senses. It hasn’t.

S/Air. Never thought it wd. at first. We knew we had to go thro’ with it.

M/L. Don’t go in for any further reprisal yet.

L.P. Distinction betwn. manacling men in custody and tying up men not yet in custody.

S/Doms. Canadians think we have put ourselves in a false posn. by concealing the truth.

Adam. What we thght wrong was the advance instrn. to tie hands in every case to prevent destruction of documents wthr. or not any need to do so to prevent escape.

S/Doms. Before any other action taken, we shd. invite views of Dom. Govts.

L.P. We shd. now give more informn. for our own people, about what happened at Dieppe.

But don’t manacle any more.

Adam. Hope G. Army will put a stop to this nonsense.

The only get-out we have offered them is tht. we will countenance no orders to this effect.

S/Doms. It’s not only a ques of orders. It is now a ques of fact because at Sark it has happened again.

Must we not say something to give G. a get-out – e.g. we have given orders, but we can’t make rules governing conduct in the heat of action.

Adam. They will keep this on for a time and then give up, saying they’ll resign if we do it again.

M/L. Doms shd. be given full report on the facts.

S/Air. And ? consult them on ques of manacling equal nos. as Germans, prs. after verifying thro’ Protecting Power tht. Germans have done it.

A.V.A. Explain reasons why we acted y’day w’out consultn.

Public criticism if we take no action until Monday.

Agreed, a) Continue with what we have said we wd. do. b) Nothing more be done at present. c) Tell Doms facts (Dieppe and Sark) and law of war and view of propriety : and tht. if G. carry out their new threat, we shd. wish to do same : invite their views on that, quickly, with view to actg. Sat. night or Sunday.
