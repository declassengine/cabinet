W.M.(42)111th Meeting 12th August 1942

I Provision of Aircraft for the War at Sea. Part heard.

S/Air. Bomber Command is shortest of all for aircraft.

M/L. Someone shd. deal with (c) in memo.

L.P.S. Sinclair means (b) is not a priority.

S.Air. Aircraft don’t exist is satisfy all.

L.P. a.b and c. over-simplify. Bound to be some switching.

M/L &amp; L.P.S. Not prepd. to reach concln. on these data.

S/Doms. We need facts to support S/Air view tht. bombing of Germany is over-riding priority.

L.P.S. This paper says we are sacrificing minimum needs for bombing.

S.Air. This puts too much emphasis on minimum.

L.P.S. Report of Brendan &amp; Slessor – was it to same effect.

M/T. Need whole picture, including wastage rates. But deprecate automatic removal fr. (c) to (b).

L.P. Paper showing what aircraft used for (c) wh. cd. be used for (b) and showg. why not diverted.

After mtg. a &amp; b, how are aircraft under (c) being utilised.

S/Doms. EEB formula and wastage. Agreed.

Bruce. Para 19. Further parts on this – what types dealt with, and why not others. Agreed.

II Burma

S/Doms. Can’t reach decisions, but wd. like to hear Govr.

D.Smith. Returng. tomorrow to Simla: wd. like some genl. guidance.

Great debt to Burma because we cdn’t defend them. Plight of peasants – who will suffer everythg. save starvation. Future – economic and political – uphill road.

Country in trouble before war. Poverty (esp.Upper Burma). Little chances for emplt. for Burmese, either in Indian or European firms.

108

Debt – rural moneylenders. Constant hostility betwn. Burmese and Indians: almost worst features of all. Completely corrupt politics. These are the abuses we want to tackle on our return.

Period of direct rule after our return so tht. we can build new Burma on more solid foundations. Economic reforms – abolition of moneylenders (38% is lowest rate of interest now!) – medical services – education (essential if there is to be any form of Democratic Govt) – legal code. These things cd. not be carried through by the Burmese themselves. During the last days, when honesty supervened, the Burmese Ministers admitted this to me.

Want on my return to begin thinking out a plan. So tht. when we get back to Rangoon we shall know what we want and how we propose to seek it.

L.P. Worth while considering apptmnt. of Commn in interim period vice appearg to re-introduce G. Col. Govt. This wd. enable you to associate some Burmese, in more than advisory capacity.

Govr. as Chairman with 4 or so Members incldg. 2 Burmans

L.P.S. What about includg. Americans and Chinese?

A.E. Difficult internationally to appear to go back to direct rule. You don’t really want to go back.

M/P. Philippine model. Direct rule + definite time limit.

M/L. Shdn’t firms be called upon to make greater contribn to welfare of Burmans.

We shd. conserve mineral and other assets for benefit of inhabitants.

D.S. Propose to go into this.

M/P. Bevin’s suggn. is fantastic. The big firms have made the largest contribution.

Agreed. Authorise D.S. to study and work up programme for submission at a later stage to War Cabinet as specific proposals.

D.S. to enlist services of experts on this study.

III India.

M/L. Labour Party, tho’ in genl. support of Govt. policy, are disturbed by Press rpts of proposal to use c. punishmnt.

L.S.A. Lumley has re-introduced this Ordinance in Bombay. No offl. informn.

109

May be only one provision in the code – and no intention to use it specially.

L.P.S. V. unfortunate publicity. Can’t Viceroy handle the Press more intelligently.

L.S.A. 3 telegrams already sent : no answer.

S/Doms. Find out what is attitude of Govt/India twds. control over Press.

Say Govt. take v. serious view : bldg. up misleadg. picture.

Also see Editors here, in consultn. M/Infn.
