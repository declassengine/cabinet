W.M.(42)105th Meeting 6th August 1942

I. India – Possible Action against Congress. (- part heard).

a) Considering some form of deportn. fr. India (Gandhi) wh. will not involve risk to his life.

Destination?

L.P. Prob. best solution to take him to Aden first – by sea. Agreed.

b) Deportation or not?

L.P. I favour deportn. because I don’t believe Govt. of India will be strong enough to hold him if he hunger-strikes in custody in India.

If those (30-40) who hunger struck in Andamans had bn. doing so in Bengal, this posn wd. be v. much more difficult.

I am confirmed in my view by what Viceroy now says about letting him out.

Simon. Then? say to Govt. of India you think you must hold him even if he does hunger-strike. Will you be able to? Hence recommend deportn now.

L.S.A. Can you force Govt. of India to agree in advance to hold him even if he does h. strike?

L.P.S &amp; S/Doms with W.O. Disagreed.

A.E. a) you must act. b) C. and Mouse – nonsense c) that being so, better surely to take him off now, out of India. We cd. say that to Viceroy now.

L.P. If you get G. away before he h-strikes, good chance the others won’t do it. If he starts the others much likelier to follow his example.

Agreed - a) No C. &amp; Mouse : no release fr. detention once he gets in, even tho’ he hunger-strikes

b) Tell Viceroy in our view better to take him out of India f.with – to Aden by sea.

L.S.A. The other 15/20 leaders?

L.P. &amp; W.O. They don’t matter if you get G. out.

L.P.S. From publicity pt. of view doubtful if wise to isolate G.

L.P. Take ½ doz. to Uganda by air – Agreed.
