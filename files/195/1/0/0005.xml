P.M. McGovern’s speech. include. reference to shipping losses over 800.000 tons p.month. 

M/Inf. He said “I can say because publicly announced …..”

P.M. Telegram fr. Roosevelt about surplus of American ships – protests about our re-loading &amp; re-arranging cargoes so as to concentrate in available ships the high priority munitions supplies. Various interchanges endg. with proposal by Adm. King tht. we shd. take 10 ships off Atlantic convoys. Read text of his reply on this point. 

F.O. We can pack our Protocol requirements in 24 ships in 2 months. This leaves ?26 for U.S.. – ample. Reason for U.S. surplus now is overtakg. arrears, and also despatch of useful but superfluous cargoes – eg. food. 

Evatt. Last Wed. at Pacific Council Washington R. spoke on this point in a sence wh. indicated that he now accepts P.M. view 

Strings on the Protocol? 

P.M. Yes. we can alter on new circs. 

Military. 

C.I.G.S. Burma. Last wk. fighting on E-N road : main threat was on Lashio. 

Rapid progress made – &amp; Japs. were in Lashio by 30/4. This forced retirement on Mandalay front. 29/30 we withdrew over Irrawaddy no complete means of our present dispositions. Gave account of best estimates we can make fr. here. 

Certain Chinese forces will have to conform with this withdrawal. 

N.E. of Lashio new Divn. from inside China. 

Nearer sea-coast evacuation of Makiow ordered. 

Advance on Lashio not carried out in gt. force. – done with tanks and 

M.T. Feared 6th Ch. Army didn’t fight well. 

5 Jap. Divns. active in Burma. 

P.M. Telegram fr. Govr. Burma, who is cut off fr. Alexander. 

I have ordered him to return by air to India, as soon as he feels he can do no more. Now heard that he has left, by air. 

22 

As regards Alexander, I have told Wavell that when his force falls below that of Divn. he shd. return to India. Wavell replied – can’t get him out until he reaches : Kalua. 

C.I.G.S. Further east, no more signs of movement into Manchuria. 

Libya. Bad sandstorms &amp; little change. 

Repairs going well, or better. And spares have improved. 

Russia. V. little. Minor operation at Murmansk – landed behind German lines &amp; moved down S.W. 

Still no sign of big offensive. Inclined now to think cdn’t start until 1/6. And even so no sign tht. we cd. do anything v. big. 

Malta.Change of Govt. Report by M/State favoured change, &amp; appointment of Govt. 

P.M. Reported on action taken. Read telegrams sent. 

C.O. I have wired Dobbie about publicn – ascertain his views. 

Told him Govt shd. take over at once on arrival. 

Agreed – no announcement. until Govt has arrived. 

F.O. Can we publish the weight of the attack? 

Agreed – F.O. &amp; C.O. to consult with other Dpts a substantial statement. Malta for release to Press on Dobbie’s resignation being announced – by statement in H/Commons pm. on Thursday. 

War Cab approved P.M.’s action. 

Tankers. (M/W.T. and Sec Petroleum attending). 

M/W.T. No final stoppage. Complete off U.S. sea-board – considerable on entry to Caribbean. But we can’t stop all. Certain amount of re-routing – using Freetown convoy as far as they can. We must do this, to meet commitments places where no stocks. When enemy gets to know, we must re shape our course. 

Since orders for stopping off given 3 wks. ago losses have bn. much less. 

Fact that we lose one here &amp; there mustn’t be taken as reason for complete stop. 

Sec/Pet. 20 tankers a week/month lost in March &amp; April. Down now to 6. 

23 

Stoppage in Caribbean for a week will mean loss on our stocks of 200.000? tons. 

What we shd. like is small shuttle convoy fr. W. of Trinidad to E. of Aruba. 

This is now under considn. by Admy. 

P.M. Accepted the case put fwd. by M/W.T. 

See/Pet. Supplying Australia from Trincomalee 

Only way in wh. we cd. supply U.S. needs in Australia was to run down stocks in Trincomalee. Those stocks were 850.000 tons. 

C.N.S. Convoys off U.S. Coast. Have just had signal fr. Adml. King to say that convoy from central Section – Hampton Roads to Key West – Ready by 15 May, but think won’t be able to start until 15 June. 

Troubled because hint tht. King still not wholly convinced of value of convoy system. 

This was being cleaned up. 

Foreign Affairs. 

F.O. Giraud. Did go to Vichy. Laval wanted him to see Petain – so tht. latter cd. urge him not to play heroic part! We believe he is still in Vichy. 

Germans have asked for his surrender – wh. Vichy have refused. 

Australia 

Evatt. Invited by P.M. to speak – said brght. good wishes of his Govt. &amp; P.M. who had no object other than to advance the common cause. 

Prod: improved but that doesn’t mean our Army is well equipped. 

To-day short even in small arms. Increased output – overtime - Labour are pulling well - dir n into danger spots in North. 

MacArthur and his Directive. Disturbed by “priority plan” of dealing with Germany first &amp; Japan later. Japan had showed themselves v. highly skilled in use of all 3 arms. On outbreak of war with Japan we had not one fighter plane in Australia. We now have aircraft because of fall of Dutch E. Indies. 

MacA. now given orders about his duties, incldg. attack on Japanese. 

24 

MacA. thinks supplies are not sufficient. Altho. U.S. are putting in 700 aircraft there are 13 squadrons of R.A.A.F wh. have nothng. better than Harvard trainers. 

Tendency to segregate the requirements of the 3 diff. services. 

Aust. Govt. think it necessary to have a re-assessment of the strategic situation. We understand that we are only one part of the world situation – but we fear a certain tendency, here and in the U.S.A., to underestimate the Japs. 

Mr Curtin feels that, subject to ground strategy, one Australian Divn. might be left in M-East but rest might come back. 

We don’t want it to appear that Australia is the responsibility of the U.S.A. Our allegiance is to H.M. the King. 

P.M. We will facilitate your enquiries into requirements – details but v. important. Let me know if you want any help. 

See at Admy. what our strengths &amp; commitments are. 

But in principle Jap’s next move is uncertain. Got all he wants in Co- Prosperity plan. If we cd. hold it. Is he now going to make another move – if so where? Signs tht. possibly they may go v. Russia while she is in death grapple with Germany. Or will she go up into China &amp; liquidate that? And, if either, what resources for attack on either India or Australia. Our view, on the whole, is tht. he is unlikely to make a heavy attack either on Australia or on India. For why hasn’t he done it earlier? 

C.O.S. to work out itinerary – if we diverted to Australia then 8th Armoured Divn. en route for India how wd. they proceed i.e. where land &amp; where go feed. 

Evatt. We suggest small expenditure of aircraft now might serve to prevent the Japs fr. attempting invasion of Australia. 

Fact tht. America has taken operational responsb. for defence of Australia does not for one moment mean that we abate one jot of our determination to see that our people in Australia are defended to the utmost of the power of the United Nations.
