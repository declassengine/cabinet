A.E. They will do good. They were chosen by Speaker. Ch.Whip knows.

L.P.S. Announcement in Press today tht. R.A.F. will be there. Looked official. Whence came it?

M/Inf. Promised to enquire.

S/Air. Renewed repves. sent to Peirse.

A.E. Groundstaff already there – doing nothing – bad impression.

P.M. Favoured sendg. a squadron.

S/Air. – considering only wthr. it can be done.

I am in favour of it, if practicable.

P.M. Renewed his protest v. Parly. mission : and indicated tht. he wd. like at least to be consulted in advance before anything like this is done again!

L.S.A. Showing no signs so far of wanting to starve.

P.M. Indian show-down v. satisfactory. Recruiting v. favourable. Congress shown unable to move the masses – a great flop. They have come out as a revolutionary movement : influenced or working with Japanese : and have failed. Shows that Congress don’t represent India – only Congress caucus and Hindu priesthood.

L.S.A. Tell U.S.A. that this impression has bn. done by Indian Executive Council and 5 Indian Provincial Govts.

Disciplinary Powers of Indian Army Officers.

L.S.A. (1) No legislation here.

(2) Numbers. Mostly junior officers. V. few in command. A few 2nd in command who might command temporarily. Consider P.M.’s suggn.of giving them King’s Commns. when occasion arises. Diffy. is tht. need often temporary – awkward to make them permanently difft. in status. Also automatic takg. over when superior wounded.

Numbers small – but principle important. They may be turned sour, as Washington was by being put under B. junior officer.

W.O. Worst moment for an inevitable change.

135
