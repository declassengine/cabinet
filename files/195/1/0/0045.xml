Foreign Affairs.

A.E. Demonstn. on Soviet Day. We undertook to accept invitn. to send Service contingents and on L.P. decision we shd. not now send them. If we now withdraw ours, other Allies wd. be in awkward posn.

L.P.S. Our L.P. decision not intended to be retrospective.

P.M. On merits, doubtful about wisdom of sending our troops to Communist organised affair.

L.P.S. Incident if we withdraw now we have promised. F.O. supported this.

P.M. Not so much if we take Allies into confidence and all withdraw.

W.O. Original decision by Service Dpts. based on rather casual advice fr. H.O.

S/Air. Wd. have preferred to stand by June decision of W. Cab. against Service attendance at this kind of thing.

P.M. x// This must be discussed by Cab. after notice, and in presence of Home Secy.

M/L. Risk letting them go. Far more trouble by withdrawing.

x// Agreed : meet Tuesday to decide. Full programme to be submitted to P.M. at least, if not W. Cabinet.

P.M. Stand where we are. No answer to our ques to Protectg. Power. Wait for it. Hitler’s action, not that of German Genl. Staff or adminn. of p.o.w. camps, wh. has bn. v. correct. Clear tht. his order is being questioned in offl. circles in Germany. He is in a diff. posn. fr. wh. he seeks to escape by enlarging area of controversy. See what they do before we act. German Army and F.O. will do their best to restrain him. Even if present reprisals drag on, no gt. harm will be done. We can ease it off.

Bruce. Dom. Govts. views. I told my Govt. premature to make any decision before we get reply fr. P. Power. I thought it nec. to do so because not clear from D.O. telegrams.
