W.M.(42)139th Meeting 12th October 1942. (10.30p.m.)

Manacling of Prisoners of War.

W.O. Intercept radio – Germany refusing recognise intervention by Swiss. Besides Dieppe prs. 3 times 4.000 odd (?) put in chains.

P.M. Doms. soft. If we are defeated on this ill treatment of prs. will be used as black-mailing tactics.

What happens eg in trench and raids doesn’t affect relations betwn. Govts.

No enquiry possible into events in battle – eg wthr. a person was killed who might have bn. taken pr. And business of Protectg. Power is with events in camps, not in field.

W.O. 240 tied in U.K. during daylight only. Handcuffs with about 1ft. chain – taken off at night.

P.M. Nothg. to be published to indicate diffce. of opinion betwn. us and Doms.

M/I. No danger in U.K. Press. Danger prs. later in Dom. Press.

S/Doms. All 4 Doms. are unhappy : not Canada only. While they stand in with us on what we’ve done, they don’t want to go further and wish to explore arbitn. by P. Power.

P.M. Bad ground to argue on facts.

M/P. Begin by differentiating betwn. events in battle and treatment in cage.

L.P. Said already.

M/I. In Fleet Street. feeling tht. in auction of atrocities G. bound to win. No criticism (much) about actions taken so far : but don’t want to see it pressed further.

P.M. We’ve each tied up 1.500. G. threaten to go up to 5.000. They haven’t publicly announced they’ve done it. No further action from us therefore until offl. G. announcement tht they have done so. Wd. say to H/C tomorrow “no further statement”.

L.P.S Advantages in saying tomorrow enough to enable us to stall for some days.

Cranb. Motion in H/Lords by Bishop Truro.

P.M. Still think no statement unless further announcement by Germans.

156

If they make a further bid, shd. we go on to manacle those not of the 5.000. I wd. then G. wd. have to chain another 12.000. Then diffies.begin to be great. Then we chain 12.000. Then they have to go to 36.000. They will find that v. hard. And don’t many of them work?

W.O. Yes – in mines. roads etc.

G. wd. be at end of tether after the 3rd round, no more prs. left. Alternative. Turn the other cheek and submit. We may have to – if opinion in U.K. Domes divided.

Hitler has triumphed – proved. B. at fault – wd. know he cd. do what he liked to our prs. w’out fear of retaliation on his.

But even that wd. be preferable to arbitration by a neutral Power into our actions. That wd. be the worst solution of all.

M/L. German propaganda. stresses a) introdn. of Colonial troops &amp; U.S. had led to this. B. wdn’t behave like this. (b) followed on War Guilt statement.

Shdn’t (a) be sent to Doms.

M/P. Another course. If you don’t say nos. chained. G. have threatened to treble but we aren’t going to say how many we will chain. Reserve right to manacle as many as we like. I wd. manacle then 3.600. This wd. get away from the arithmetical progression. And deprive them of a date and time.

S/Doms. Risk of other forms of beastliness.

Shd we not stand fast and wait for them to get tired.

M/L. Risk tht. Doms. won’t manacle any more.

W.O. We cd. then take up the running with Italians.

M/L. But will our public opinion support any more.

Germans (radio) don’t seem happy about it. Stand fast and await developments.

You can’t withdraw. But if you make another threat, you invite rejoinder.

Fear tht. this may lead to G. shooting prs. – an example wh. we cdn’t follow.

P.M. I wd. shoot in those circs.

157

M/L. Doubt if public opinion wd. support that.

Statement in H/C. tomorrow or not.

L.P.S. This may be last occasion you can make one. Make it therefore if G. makes no move before then.

P.M. Instinct is to say nothing.

L.P.S. Something to be said for repeatg. in Parlt. in somewhat diff. way the latest statement to Press. If G. make announcement tomorrow morning, then say “no statement”.

M/I. Supported M/P. suggn. In reply to criticism tht. Prot. Power wd. find out what numbers, yes but that will take time : meanwhile it will all simmer down.

W.O. What of ultimate release fr. this situation – by whose intervention?

Cadogan. Office of Swiss Govt. F.O. wd. answer – “if any decln. you wd. like to make to both sides, no objection”. Possible way out. Related of course only to treatment in Camps.

L.P.S. A proper course.

S/Doms. Public anxiety “how are you getting out of this?” Welcome Swiss help if it affords a way out. What is alternative?

L.P.S. Go on till both sides are bored.

L.P. Treatment in camps is regulated by Convention : and we can’t refuse to discuss that with anyone, as implied by M/P suggn.

x/ Need to explain to our own people distinction between treatment in camps and treatment in course of capture.

Cadogan. Article in Convention about dispute between belligerents. Providing for conference of belligerence on neutral soil. Dangerous if we get involved in that sort of thing.

Cranb. There is in H/Lords a Motion for Debate : and, altho’ I can ask him, I doubt wthr. he will take it off.

Ch.Whip. Valuable if statement cd. be made in H/Commons to clear up x/.M/Inf. supported this. M/L. didn’t object, providg. no statement of future action.

Unwise to commit ourselves to future action. Also “no wordy discussion” with G.

158

P.M. Why not reply to Swiss. Read out offer and reply in H/C. and decline to say more, on grnd. tht. we must await reply.

Say to Swiss – Tying in heat of battle depends on circs. Haig not prepd. discuss events in field – this is difft. fr. camps – there they are protected by Convention. You offered to intervene. Pl. convey to G. our protest at their “reprisal” based on events in field. As soon as G. unchain them, we will unchain their prs.

Cadogan. Private offer of help. Embarrassing to them if we replied in public.

L.P. Make P.M. statement w’out ref.

[P.M. withdrew to dictate draft statement.]

Statement approved.

W.O. to submit written statement tomorrow showg. how we are chaining the Germans.

S/Doms. C.O.S. warned by Eisenhower tht. Morgenthau shd. be told nothing because likely to leak.

P.M. Let C/Exchequer know.

Madagascar.

W.O. Cd. Cabinet know what F.O. has said to de Gaulle?

P.M. I have sent him a Minute drawg. his attention to Platt’s recent statement tht. everything is going v. nicely in Madagascar, and advising caution.
