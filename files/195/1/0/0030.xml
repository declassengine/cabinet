W.M.(42)113th Meeting 17th August 1942.

Press Interviews by Senior Officers Abroad

M/L. Statements in Sunday pp. by Air.V.M. Lloyd in U.S.

a) Opportunity to cut Rommel’s supplies not taken. Report on this.

b) Possibility of taking Tunis.

Dangerous. Serving offrs. abroad shdn’t engage in this sort of talk.

S/Air. Must know first if mis-reported.

At home rule now tht. offrs. shan’t give interviews w’out permission – M/Infn is co-operatg.

In this case man at B. Embassy got him to give the talk w’out inf. to Ministers.

Our repves. abroad shd. be told not to give such invitations.

L.P.S. No objection if we had stuck to facts about Malta.

Agreed. S/Air to obtain full report on what he said, who asked him etc.

Halifax. Hope no rule tht. servg. offrs. abroad shd. say nothing w’out inf. home.

E.g. Dill has bn. asked often to speak : I have said “Yes” if I saw brief. The repve. abroad shd. be in posn. to judge w’out reference home, wh. wd. involve delay.

K.W. Unwise for offrs. to enter “political” arena at all.

S/Air. Usually arises because asked questions, wh. they are pressed to answer.

If Hal. suggn. adopted, I don’t mind but I can’t then take responsibility.

L.P.S. Diplomatic repves. don’t always know military background.

Hal. I have Joint Staff Mission to advise me.

Statements ok – but interviews with Press v. much more objectionable.

Halifax. Rigid rules about interviews. But give some latitude for set speeches.

114

S/Doms. Statements if vetted can be passed by B. repve. abroad. But no Press interviews.

Agreed.

Nash. But young hero types don’t have scripts in advance. They just talk. Don’t stop them doing that.

L.P.S. Junior offrs. in diff. posn. Our ruling cd. be limited to senior officers.

Exceptions can be made in particular cases – eg Mountbatten – with permission of War Cabinet.

“Officers who have held high command.”

Report on Women’s Services.

L.P.S. Suggn. tht. recommns. have been, or are being, implemented. Can you publish statement of what is being or has been done.

W.O. Say at publication a great many of recommns. have been, or are being, carried out.

Agreed.

W.O. Will M/Inf. lead Press on disposal of the rumours – vilification.

M/Inf. Yes. If W.O. will give the hand-out. Agreed.

M/L. 50. 211/212. Immobile women. I think much more can be done. Cd. some Cttee consider in detail. Agreed – defer till consider merits of Rpt.

W.O. There is a Cttee wh. will take this in its stride – it is considg. how work in mixed stations can best be divided betwn. A.T.S. soldiers, civilians etc.

Carlton Hotel as Officers’ Club for U.S. Forces.

L.P. U.S. Authies. now don’t want it. Offrs. as against men.

Read letter fr. Eisenhower. Action dictated solely by interests of U.S. Forces.

Took note.

India.

a) Situation

115

L.S.A. Generally, better. Most serious in Bihar – interference always continuing at Patna and scattered violence.

Widespread attacks on communns. indicate premeditated purpose : but results indicate lack of organisation.

No serious communal trouble so far.

L.P. Report tht. Police in Bihar are cause for anxiety.

L.P.S. Publicity in India leadg. to spread of disorder. Can’t that be stopped?

L.S.A. Viceroy is “considering”. War Cab. He seems a bit slow.

W.O. But really he has decided not to do it. – L.P. agreed.

Halifax. Introdn. of Press Ordinance before result in voluntary cessation of publicn. of Nat. Press.

Then rumours produced an almost worse situation. Prs. Govt/India are thinking of that.

L.S.A. Give Viceroy time and discretion.

L.P.S. Press here can play it down – but not to suggest tht. the thing is all over.

b) Assurance to Viceroy’s Council.

L.S.A. Personal risk wh. members had run.

Viceroy’s approval to draft obtd. Since then – amended to meet L.P.S’s criticisms.

Amended draft approved.

c) Gandhi’s Fast.

L.S.A. No alteration but unconditional release or let him die.

Neither Govnrs. nor W/C in C. will face second.

L.P.S. Why not let him out as soon as he begins to fast.

L.P. This is cont. Let him out when he is likely to die. Who will judge that?

The M.O. He will take no risks. What instns. will you give to M.O. – you can’t do it. Either responsible professionally or not. He can’t accept instns. v. his prof. discretion. With a man of this age, he will take no risks.

116

Halifax. Then M.O. will let him go as soon as health goes back.

L.P. It’s a mockery then to talk about detaining him until health is in danger.

Halifax. Will you cat and mouse?

L.S.A. Original plan – but War.Cab didn’t like it.

Halifax. I wd. in no circs. have G. die on my hands. Re-inforced by Weras? dying.

That being so, wd. leave handling of it to Viceroy. Make up your mind on this fundamental ques.

L.P.S. Once you’ve made up yr. mind not to keep him to death, let him out the moment he begins to fast.

W.O. Moral of this is tht. our original decision to deport was right.

L.P. Not going v. Viceoy if you accept my view.

My own experience. I’ve resisted suggn. of instns. to M.O.

You can say “well hold him whatever happens : you do yr best for him” – he can cope.

But given this situation, M.O. will play for safety.

Unfair to ask M.O. that. Say “Tell us when yr. judgement it is unsafe to keep him”.

Doubtful policy to put G. in, if you weren’t going to be firm.

V. dangerous to yield to hunger strike.

I wd. put him in a ring fence – but take no responsibility for him or his health. No Govt. M.O. except at G’s request. No rules about food. Then I wd. see it thro.

That propn. has never bn. put to G/India. This is what I did with Indians in Bengal. Made clear tht. they were responsible. Then let him starve.

W.O. agreed – and wished to be so recorded.

Modified form of internment of “Home domicile” in Bengal. Method well known in India.

117

W.O. Ques arose when I was in India. Viceroy asked his Council : about Fulla? – who said people in India wd. soon get over his death.

L.S.A. L.P.’s propn. wdn’t meet objns.

S/Doms. Agreed with L.P. K.W. and L.S.A. leaned twds. the Viceroy.

L.P. Effect of G. dying wd. be considerable, in my view.

Halifax. Tell Viceroy we don’t like his S. telegram. Put L.P.’s proposal to him. We wd. withdraw – our only condn. being prevention. of his revolutionary courses.

Agreed.

d) Whipping Ordinance.

L.S.A. Telegram fr. Lumley. Acts v. useful – welcomed by large sections of community.

Sparingly used – 39 cases in 9 wks riot.

Riot, g.b.h. and only.

1) Asked to find out nature of the instrument.

M/Inf. Why did Lumley broad-cast?

L.P.S. 2) Issue some re-assuring statement.

Agreed – 1) and 2)

L.P. Hope they won’t do any whipping. Agreed. (Convey that impression

(to Viceroy. i.e. Don’t

(withdraw, but don’t use.

(Strong caution against.

c) Continued

W.O. Will it be most clear in telegram tht. we attach importance to G. not winning or scoring by fast. Issue is whtr. G/India or G. are going to win.

Express grave disquiet about this risk.

North American Supplies.

Took note of W.P. (42)353.

M: Nash. 118

Expressions of farewell.
