W.M.(42)122nd Meeting 9th September 1942

Parliamentary Business.

India Debate.

L.P.S. Friday adjournment – free at present.

P.M. Anyone can raise any subject they please. But don’t want organised debate India.

(Shd. have thought in order to discuss y’day – at least military situation).

A.E. Pity to have whole day on India.

L.P.S. If others raise it – shd. we have Govt. reply?

Ch.Whip. If debate immed. followg. P.M. statement, pref. to make the statement on the adjournment not before it. It cd. still be statement, not speech.

P.M. In that case, I wd. prefer to make a speech.

L.P.S. Better not. Wd. encourage a day’s Debate.

L.P.S. Statement on 8.9.42.

P.M. Why encourage criticism?

L.P.S. Didn’t. Regretted lost opportunity to express support.

P.M. Silent support is prhs. best. H/C in v. good mood – better to have left them alone.

L.P.S. Genl. affect was bad.

P.M. Disagreed.

L.P.S. If Parlt. is not then after a months’ holiday then they might wait – at least until P.M. had finished his speech.

P.M. Didn’t worry me – luncheon engagements etc.

S/Doms. Root diffces. in hours of mtg. Lunch breaks first speech – and effect = dinner hour in place.

L.P.S. House won’t agree to meet 2 p.m.

Ch.Whip. Papers going early to press – diffies. of transport – reasonable tht. H/C. shd. want to go on mtg. earlier.

P.M. M.P.’s don’t work by makg. speeches: watchdogs can be silent.

L.P.S. Difft. view – many Members can debate w’out snarling.

P.M. Country not perfervid – gettg. on with their jobs.

A.E. if Manchester Guardian – debate not an anti climax.

S/Doms. Members with engagements (Cttees etc) “mimed after P.M. has spoken”. And the Cttees etc wh. are part of Parly.life now have to be crowded into the 3 days sittings.

[Torch. Danger of pieces of informn. being built into a story.]

India – no organised Debate. Day is free if others raise it.

P.M. Shd. I make my India statement Thursday – in order to separate it fr. Debate. Then have Friday free for all subjects at choice of members.

Say today “P.M. will make short statement on India tomorrow”. If asked about Debate – say “not tomorrow because interference with Soldiers’ Pay: but there’s Friday when any subject can be raised on the Adjournment”.
