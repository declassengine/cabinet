W.M.(42) 69th Meeting 29th May 1942 

Coal – Reorganisation – Production Programme 1942/43 – Fuel Rationing. 

L.P. Summarised statistical review set out in W.P. (42)226. 

Leaving out economy in domestic consumption, we have deficiency of 3.2 m. tons &amp; have made no allowance for contingencies eg. Bolero. 

On this – do not recommend withdrawal of men from Field Army. 

Shall we proceed with rationing – wh. wd. save 6m. tons? 

This turns on decision about re-organisation. Summarised proposals. 

Regional organisation – complete control over operation of mines – no interference with financial structure of the industry. 

If good will behind it, this re-organisation shd. arrest decline in output and in addition give us some net increase in production. 

That being so, prefer to put emphasis on increased production – but get ready to introduce points rationing at short notice and press for voluntary economy. 

B/T. On the rationing scheme. Many consultns – incldg. Conferences with Local Fuel Overseers. 

Conclusion – v. gt. diffy. in applying any scheme without points &amp; coupons. Alternative scheme wd. involve more staff (for enforcement) &amp; persons of higher calibre. 

Original scheme simplified &amp; modified. Total staff requd reduced. Overriding limit of 33⅓% to reduction wd. relieve anxieties about the larger houses. 

Householders appln form – v. simple – wd. give a simple assessment. Wd. disclose stocks held. Provision to claim supplementary ration. 

Agreed with some reluctance that, if re-organisation can be got going with good will, we need not introduce rationing at this stage. Think we are running large risks – some of the reductions in L.P.’s memo. Are risky. 

L.P. Cttee unanimous that, if rationing has to come, this is the best (and indeed the only practicable) scheme so far devised. 

Restrictions on deliveries will be maintained meanwhile – under control. 

W.W. Certain people are now doing without their basic allowance while others are getting supplementary allowances. 

B/T. We will look into this. 

If we wait till autumn, the scheme can’t differentiate between – those with &amp; those without stocks. Much of the domestic winter coal will be already in stock, &amp; that much more will be outside rationing control. 

P.M. Man-Power. Short-term. Release proceeding satisfactorily. 

Long-term. Forster Cttee? Report end June. 

35 

L.P. Wastage – must be checked. 

M/L. Hope to releases on medical grounds by re-habilitation scheme. Experiment at Mansfield great success. Great man-power gain both ways – the fit men shd. stay in mining, but those not fit enough for mining can be rescued for other work before it is too late. 

Attitude of owners? 

K.W. No great diffy. expected. 

Wages? 

B/T. Miners &amp; owners have asked to see Ministers on wages. 

P.M. Peace-time system of ascertainment shdn’t be disturbed lightly. But new factor introduced by direction to &amp; retention in mining. 

L.P.S. And you have also fixed prices therefore Govt. is controlling the amount available for distribution. 

P.M. On this account Govt. shd. give something additional in wages. 

K.W. We shall have to hear what they say. Advantages in relating increased wage to increased output, if that is possible. 

P.M. Consider, yes, but we must open that door. Miners are a special community - &amp; if you have taken their liberty away there is a case for differentiating them from men in other industry. Something separate &amp; apart fr. what wd. be paid under the ascertainment procedure. 

K.W. All financial ques left over for discussion with the parties. 

P.M. But in White Paper a) Forster Cttee &amp; long-term intake. 

b) Finance, wages, to be subject to consultation. 

S/Doms. Bear in mind psychology of industry. Agree can’t interfere now with the financial structure of industry. But we shd. say something about the future – is show that Govt. will not let the industry down after the war. i.e. this is immediate war-time system, we shall consider the future as part of post-war problems. 

M/L. Two questions on wages. 

a) minimum. This affects my direction of men to return. I wd. wish miners wd. consent to deal with this first &amp; quickly. Men returned have bn. out of mines for some time, &amp; it’s a little while before they can earn their money. This lag is difficult for me. Settle it quickly. 

b) B/T. is keen on output bonus. V. difficult. Experience of datum line in last war not v. encouraging. This is sound in principle, but will take some time to work out. 

36 

K.W. even on a) we must consider repercussions. 

P.M. If there is one trade you can pick out from all others, surely mining is that one. 

K.W. Economy. Sustained publicity will be needed. Prepared to see Editors and get them right. Also get them to lay off criticism of rationing. 

M/L. Wages. No reference in White Paper. No objn to reference in speech to willingness to discuss wages with industry. 

P.M. White Paper. Statement on Tuesday that Debate will be held on Wednesday week – L.P. to open and L.P.S. to wind up. 

Lay White Paper on Wed-evening – show it to both sides on Wednesday (earlier). 

After Debate (Sunday evening) I will be ready to broadcast. 

Ch.Whip. H/C. will want 2-day Debate. If so P./Bd. of Trade should speak. 

L.P.S. May I arrange the order of debate? 

P.M. Yes. 

Cranborne. Unnecessary to have Debate in H/Lords.
