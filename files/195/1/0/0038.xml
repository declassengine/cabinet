W.M.(42)123rd Meeting 10th September 1942. 10.45pm.

I. Parliament. Debate India.

Ch.Whip. After P.M. statement (adjournment talk and later Debate) Conservatives tabled a Motion (16 names). Argued tht. this wd. stop discussion tomorrow, on grd. tht. P.M. had promised time for formal discussion later. Done deliberately to stop discussion tomorrow.

Cd. be avoided by saying no definite date for future Debate – S.O. “reasonable time”.

P.M. Don’t want benefit by trick. But don’t want debate w’out Division. Prefer to promise Debate w’in 2 wks. of return. But cd. bring House back for formal Debate Tuesd. &amp; Wed. Much less harmful than sporadic talk Friday.

W. Durg. wk. trying hard to avoid debate. Hopg. yr. statement wd. clear the air. That statement did however irritiate certain sections of House. I therefore suggd. to Spker tht. we shd. have organised debate Friday – balanced views. Then resolution put down. Our policy to avoid Divn – tht. is what I’ve tried to avoid – eyes of the world on this discussion. I recognise no trick : but can I convince my Party of this? Put down, I think, to meet the challenge given this morning. But I wd. prefer a Debate tomorrow, without a Divn.

S.Doms. A lot of steady Labour Members wd. speak tomorrow. Balanced views.

L.P.S. If taken on motion spkers will be called in turn.

M/L. Found tempers in H/Commons tonight running v. high. All this among our friends not the Shinwells – they feel they’d been tricked by the Motion. If debate tomorrow avoided, we may get split in Labour Party v member of Govt. All our Labour friends who have supported us in the India crisis must not be allowed to go off the rails over this point of procedure.

Cd not Glyn and cd. withdraw their Motion?

L.P.S. They can’t.

P.M. If we say tomorrow full Debate w’in 2/3 weeks of re-assembling, Spker will call no-one on India. If we don’t say that, he will call India tomorrow. Therefore the issue is in hands of Govt.

L.P.S. Can – if said P.M. promised debate, does not stand : answer wd. have to be given.

145

P.M. “I won’t say anything today wh. will hamper the House in their desire to talk about India today”. “On some future date, dependent on circs in India” wd. meet Speaker.

P.M. What sort of debate shd. we have tomorrow?

S/Doms. Solid views will be expd. tho’ some screamers will no doubt intervene.

Given promise of future Debate in terms agreed with Speaker, and then let the discussion on adjournment proceed.

P.M. Feeling only about Resolution?

L.P.S. Not only that. Some objns. to provocation tone of P.M.’s statement.

A.E. If it goes ill tomorrow, we can put a Govt. motion down and get a vote later.

Why did Conservatives put the Resolution down?

Ch/Whip. V. largely because they believed this was not the time to debate India.

L.P.S. But P.M. and I have both said there wd. be chance of talkg. about it on Friday.

Say – we don’t want to take any action wh. wd. debar discussion.

L.S.A. to speak about 3 p.m.

Right of secession – discussed.

Decision - We think better to have had fixed Debate later. But as expectns. raised, wd. not be proper Govt. take any step wh. wd. make that impossible. Therefore no date for future debate sufficiently precise to prevent Speaker from callg. people on India tomorrow.

P.M. Remains only to square the people to whom I promised today a debate soon after Recess. Ch. Whip to see these Members.

Make it a reasonable Debate tomorrow.

W. Greenwood will begin. Will take line of Labour party resolution.

Jim Walker will follow. Spkr. will take whatever names suggd. to him.

II Citrine’s Visit to U.S.A. Statement at Blackpool criticising Halifax.

A.E. Saw Citrine about his visit to U.S. Said hoped he wdn’t go. He gave no promise – said initiation with U.S. not him. 146

L.P.S. He telephoned saying he understood A.F.L. wanted him to cancel his visit.

A.E. We had said we wished him to take initiation.

Today he spoke at B’pl. – disclosing tht. we had asked him not to go – criticised Halifax for his advice. See account in “Star” this evening. Said to give false impression of what happened.

Shd. I say somethg. in support of Halifax – who was [advised by Tawney and H. Butler]. Will wait and see whtr. Press play it down. If they don’t will harm P. Notice Ques and answer firmly tomorrow referring to [ ] and sayg. satisfied with H. advice.

M/L. Say it – whtr. Press play it down or not.
