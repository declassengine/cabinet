P.M. Beg my colleagues and mil. authies. to look on this as a springboard. We must look at once at mil. opns. undertaken fr. there. This is the moment for the offensive.

Smuts. We must go ahead at once with planning.

P.M. Tragic mistake to think we can take our time with this war. Hitler is playing now for a stalemate. This is our real danger. Never has there bn. more need for urgency in the war.

Smuts. This is our first big chance in the war. Move on at once and we shall then be able to strike hard in the spring. Vast advantages in shipping. In N. Africa we have the base for a real victory front – from the South not fr. the West.

P.M. We saw d. G. y’day : and he has behaved v. well.

We can’t throw him over. He asked us to prevent U.S. fr. dividing the F. French.

It was in this connn. that I was anxious to announce appmnt. of Legentilhomme.

A.E. That is why I don’t want to refer to arrangement.

Liability of Members of Parliament.

M/L. Register : cards kept separately : I write askg. M.P. to define his choice : and on hearing his decision enter it on card. This is system for N.S. Acts – wd. like H. to assimilate their practice to mine.

Approved.

Armistice Day.

P.M. Wd. have liked the 2 Minutes Silence and no more.
