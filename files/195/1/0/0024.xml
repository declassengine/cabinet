W.M.(42)103rd Meeting 4th August 1942

Foreign Affairs.

A.E. Harriman to-day. Pres. had told him to be avail. for any journey. Wd. it be useful for him to go to Cairo and on. Advised him to wire Pres and invite him to wire his views to P.M. – if he favoured it.

L.P.S. Doubt whtr H’s contract with Stalin was partly good.

I therefore discouraged it, when P.M. mooted it to me.

Leakage.

A.E. Told Maisky this a.m. Put out. At a loss to explain. Scouted breakg. of cipher (R). He has learned he is not to go back to Moscow for the visit.

S/Doms. P.M. on telephone has said he doesn’t want R. visit to be announced publicly.

II Publicity for U.K. Troops.

S/Doms. Troublesome partly. fr. correspondents in threatres of war.

M/Inf. 18 English newspp. correspondence (accredited) in Cairo.

W.O. Their standard said to be low.

M/Inf. Generality are poor.

W.O. These instns. have bn. sent several times to M/East.

In last 10 days attacks were primarily infantry – and they are mainly Dom. and Indian.

M/Inf. Harm done throughout world to England has bn. incalculable.

Bruce: Both Aust. Press and returned Aust. soldiers have criticised this.

M/Inf. Ban now withdrawn on mention of names of B. requirements. W.O. now giving reasonable facilities. W.O. 6 months’ ago.

M/Inf. Content cut of hand-outs fr. Cairo is what matters.

W.O. D.P.R. W.O. has exhorted the Press many times on this point.

L.P.S. Then cd. someone go out &amp; try to straighten this out.

M/P. The D.P.R’s job in Cairo is impossible. He’s always wrong. Only way is to leave it to the offl. communiqués on one hand and on the other to

95

journalists alone. Cover in offl. communiqués the point about U.K. troops – by instructions – and leave the background to the unaided efforts of the journalists.

M/Inf. I will be content if U.K. troops mentioned in communiqués.

Then I will hound the journalists out of the Cairo base and go seek informn I can then stop them fr. hanging about for background from DPR talk in Cairo.

Also – the good journalists are all in the Army.

Took note.

III Use of Psychologists and Psychiatrists in Services.

L.P.S. I can re-assure Cabinet on this.

Nash. P.10 Para 22 – despatch of feeble-minded men to M/East. Last quarter of 1941. This was preposterous. General feeling (strong) in agreement.

L.P.S. No selection technique applied to drafts?

W.O. No. But if selection is on its legs, they won’t get into (or stay in) Army.

S/Doms. Selection for drafts. W.O. to consider how it cd. be tightened up.

M/L. Welcome report. Pleased so long as this is kept under control.

W.O. On Appendix, my advisers think too heavily loaded on the conservation side.

Wd. prefer that this shd. be left for discussion.

L.P.S. These were suggestions of Mellanby and Jameson.

A.V.A. My people think these selections v. bad – fr. pt. of view of working together. Great deal of controversy between Bartlett and Lewis v. service psychologists.

S/Air. I think L.P.S. mistaken in thinkg Services cdn’t agree.

Agreed – subject to reconsidn. of Appendix by L.P.S. &amp; Service Ministers.

IV Supplies to Russia. Statement in Parliament.

A.V.A. Circulated revised draft.

A.E. Omit para 2 of Note for Supplementaries – if possible. Agreed.

96

Ch. Whip. Unlikely to bring an opportunity for Shinwell to raise this on Adjournment.

Otherwise – agreed.
