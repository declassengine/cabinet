W.M.(43) 92nd Meeting. 2nd July, 1943.

I. Mr McGovern: Visit to Eire.

H.O. McG. Wants to go to N.I. &amp; thence to Dublin - will speak on I.L.P.: is G.B. going Communist.

No argument re N.I.: allowed to go there before. Eire is however neutral: ques. is therefore wtr. it can be shown in natl interest. My answer to that is “No” – as before. But we did let Stokes &amp;

Aneurin Bevan go. And our High Commr. reported it helpful.

Mr. McGie M.P. (Stokes supporter) also wants to go: pol. work in Eire: told he wd. have to show natl interest &amp; tht. objects cdn’t be secured by conce.

Is it worth havg. Parly row? Tho’ I can’t see natl. interest served by either.

P.M. Do distinguish between N.I. and Eire.

S/Air. Diff. to distinguish between McGov. &amp; Stokes. You let him go.

H.O. But he has business interests there.

P.M. “Travel to neutral countries won’t be allowed save when Govt. satisfied tht. def. public advantage wd. be served or bona fide private affairs wh. won’t admit of delay. In present circs. not the policy of HMG. to facilitate ……

A.E. I have told S. Hoare tht. Astor can’t go to Madrid.

II. Palestine.

P.M. Summarised Casey’s memo.

M/State. Brought to M/E War Council because

(a) rising temper of extremist statements: their intentn to force our hands: important arms-running case.

(b) effect of trouble there wd. be wide throughout M/East.

I directed attentn of Council to (i) not to discuss merits of W.P., wh.

is widely accepted by Arabs.

(ii) not to recommend long-term policy:

next 18 mos. only, and minimum

requirements only.

Convinced situation in next 12 mos. will pass out of control, &amp; involve heavy mil. commitments because repercussions throughout M/E and we’d

233

be bound to try to protect Jewish Cttees. Quiet M/E essential to our strategy.

Recommend therefore (a) damp down extremists.

(b) maintain prestige of moderate elements.

(c) Keep reasonable no. of troops in neighbourhood.

(d) 31/3 next: no guillotine: allow balance of unused quota for immigrants (circ. 20.000) to continue to be used.

(1) Welcome proposed statement circd by F.O.

(2) Ensure maintenance in &amp; near Pal. of no. of troops desired by

C-in-C.

(3) Bring Pol. up to strength.

(4) Seize arms where known: no blind source.

(5) Don’t cut off immigration: as in (d) above.

C.O. Submd memo in May drawing attentn to deterioration of Pal. position.

Jewish feeling there is v. difft. fr. Weizmann etc.: they are totalitarian, aggressive &amp; expansionist. Wedded to Biltmore Resolutions involving adoption of Jewish State.

They are trying to run a state w’in a state v. much on Nazi lines. They were running compulsory enlistment with beating up as sanction.

There is still a moderate Jewish opinion inside &amp; out of Pal. Must encourage it.

(a) Short-term. Favour the issue of suggested Anglo-Americ an statement.

This wd. strengthen hands of moderates, who have bn. telling extremists that their behaviour is antagonising B. &amp; U.S. Govts.

Search for arms. As in Casey’s proposal, if suff. Force available to do it.

P.M. I’m committed to creation of a Jewish National Home in Palestine. Let us go on with that; and at end/war we shall have plenty of force with which to compel the Arabs to acquiesce in our designs. Don’t shirk our duties because of diffies.

S/Doms. Don’t dissent. But what I want is to face up to formulation of a proper post-war policy.

P.M. Not a good time for statements on long-term policy.

C.O. (Resuming)

(b) Long-term policy. We must look again at W. Paper

policy – agree can’t be maintained. And was going to suggest Cab. Cttee to consider that. 234

Meanwhile, recognise the diffce betwn. J. Nat Home and, J. State wh. the extremists now demand.

At least, let us seize the chance of a joint Anglo-Am. declaration.

A.E. I cdn’t support the extremists’ case of J. Nat. State for all Palestine. And I think we shd. warn them off that line soon.

P.M. Asked F.D.R. wtr intended in establishg Jewish colonies in Cyrenaica, Tripolitania. He thought they wd. be returned to European countries of origin.

S/D. I want to consider the Jewish position as a whole – world-wide.

M/State. Violence in Pal. may cause renewed persecution of Jews all over the world.

H.O. a) Jewish Nat. State in Pal.: if Trans-Jordan cd. be added &amp; deal

made with Arabs.

b) Wider issue: nos. of refugees: wd. like new Colonies in Tripolitania etc., possibly as daughter states of Pal.

Remember tht. when percentage of Jews in any one European state

goes above a certain level, there’s bound to be anti-Semitism.

S/Air. Agree with H.O. on long-term view.

Short-term problem. Jews in Pal. are nervous: have reason to fear Arabs: natural that they shd. want arms to protect themselves. Fear also of economic consequences post-war - 50.000 workg. in arms factories.

Need therefore to allay their fears. Declare eg. tht. we stand by our promise of J. Nat. Home: tht. we will protect their economic interests. Above all don’t take away their arms.

Support M.A.P.’s proposal for Conference.

Welcome Anglo. Am. decln (prefer U.S. form because warmer to Jews)

A.E. “Fear” S/Air is out of date. This was true a year ago. Now what they want is arms with which to seize Pal. as a J. Nat. State against HMG. not against Arabs. “You clear out &amp; we’ll settle with the Arabs”.

M/State confirmed.

L.S.A. Can’t be stampeded by J. extremists. But let’s understand why they are extremist. The W. Paper broke our pledges &amp; convinced the Jews tht. violence &amp; organisation is the only thing wh. will do v. B. Govt.

Eg. my speech on that occasion as well as P.M.’s.

Don’t object to joint Decln. But couple it, as M.A.P. suggests, with repetition of our old assurances to both sides. And get down quickly to consider long-term policy - before calling the Jews into conference.

235

The grand-maternal wagging of a forefinger by 2 Gt. Powers will not, alone, suffice.

P.M. Timing Don’t want to queer Turkish pitch by bringing Arab ques into public prominence.

Hence anodyne Decln only: some easement on immigration; then no public discussion of long-term solutions until the war turns more in our favour.

L.P.S. Jews &amp; Arabs both playing off v. us.

But we must have at war in statemt. to show tht. we won’t have a forcible.

Solution in Palestine.

M/State. Shirtok expects anti-Jewish Govts. in U.S.

Wavell. Close personal contact with this country for many years - know all the leaders on both sides - visited all parts of the country.

Agree that Jew is better civilisation &amp; better man. And if we stood aside, the Jews wd. win &amp; take the place for their own. But Arabs qua pledges have a good case. They all believe we gave a pledge for Arab Palestine. Also 2nd part of Balfour Declaration. Pledge in Nov. 1918. And final word in W. Paper. Thus, we have our obligations towards the Arabs.

Fr. pt/view of security of B. Empire, present aspirations of Jews in Pal. are a real menace to our position in M/East &amp; subsequently in India.

M/P. (a) Don’t be stampeded.

(b) Broaden the basis of argument, and of settlement. No solution until we can get more elbow room for settlement of Jews.

L.S.A. If partition, give Jews the coast + the Nejab. (for what it’s worth).

M/P. Suck out the Arabs fr. Palestine by irrigation in Euphrates’ area.

P.M. Wd. prefer to leave them with arms to fight it out!

M/State. Jews’ arms are in caches. Arabs hold ‘em individually. Defiance of B. law.

Don’t ask for blind search. Do recommend seizure when we know of a cache.

P.M. In the crisis of 2 years’ ago, these J. arms wd. be turned in our favour.

M/State. Don’t suggest “disarming” the Jews.

Discourage extremists: encourage moderates: seize any cache of arms wh. is publicly known to exist.

236

S/Air. This wd. mean disarming the Jews but not the Arabs.

K.W. One-sided discussion: one wd. assume there was no Arab case.

C.O. On arms, Casey’s proposal = no more than re-affirm 1940 decision of W. Cabinet.

Joint Declaration.

L.P. Include a clear warning about solution sought by force. As suggd by Casey.

A.E. 2nd Sentence in 2nd para. of U.S. draft may be thought to throw all (incldg. W. Paper) into the melting-pot.

F.O. &amp; C.O. to draft despatch to U.S. Then ask High Comms. for obsns. of that draft.

Immigration.

Agreed: Immigration to continue after March.

Arms.

Stricter control of admission. No seizure w’out notifn to War Cab., but War Cab. may be asked for leave to seize when particular cache is known.

Long-term policy. Appoint Cab. Cttee.

II. Immigration into Palestine.

Approved.
