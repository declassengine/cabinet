W.M.(43) 26th Meeting 8th February 1943

Foreign Affairs.

a) Poles in Russia. Poles likely to protest v. treatment. Ques. therefore wthr. we and U.S. Govt. shd. make some joint approach to U.S.S.R.

Sikorski may have provoked this, by indiscreet talks in U.S.A.

b) de Gaulle. Saw tonight : likely to be helpful. Recognises his 1st job is to re-create confidence in his chief. (New Foreign Secy. to de Gaulle).

c) Spain. Saw new Spanish Chargé d’Affaires. Europe in parlous condition.

State of Fr. moral v. bad indeed. Russia U.S. and U.K. : 3 powers in the world wh. can be of any influence in Europe.

d) Italy. Cabinet changes prob. due to suspicion tht. some people in his Govt. might be friendly to us. Doesn’t apply to Ciano : but reason for that prob. tht. M. want to have F.O. under his own control.

Prisoners of War.

S/Doms. P.M. has seen and agreed to telegram.

W.O. My orders must issue in next 48 hours.

Jamaica : Constitutional Changes.

C.O. In 5 yrs. no changes made, tho’ generally recognised to be overdue.

Reason mainly controversy over bi-cameral system. Felt here to be necessary to insist on unitary system of Govt. All local political opinion has now joined in repns. to me in favour of bi-cameral system. I am not against it. Presidents quoted against (eg Bahamas) based on v. difft. and more restricted franchise.

Govt. feels quite a good chance of substantial measure of agreement with these proposals.

S/Doms. Any need to preserve Govr’s right of veto?

L.P. P.R. Cttee. hope to be able after Tuesd. mtg. to present to War Cab. their conclusions on all main proposals.

On some points we wd. recommend announcement of final decisions. On others tht. Govt. shd. indicate pros and cons. On others Govt. shd. pronounce against at once. All this subject to our genl. financial review.

Ques. now is wthr. Debate shd. take place next week.

K.W. a) Pity to postpone Debate. b) Govt. cd. make useful contribution to it.

Form of Debate. We cd. draft a Motion (Govt) or one to be tabled by Repves. of all parties. Wd. object to Motion by one Party. Much to be said for Govt. Motion : move it formally : and Govt. spokesman intervene later.

A.E. Wd. favour Govt. Motion. S/Dom agreed. Ch. Whip and Ch. Labour Whip also agreed : both wanted early decision.

Ch. Whip wanted announcement Tuesday about date of Debate.

H.O. Cd. we not then say tht. Govt. are devising a suitable form of Motion and will table it.

K.W. Read draft Motion.

A.E. “That the Rpt. be now considered” : coupled with statement tht. Govt. will define their attitude.

K.W. Say Tues. merely “exact date : and I will announce on Thurs. the form wh. Debate will take”.

Ch.Whip. 3 days? Agreed.
