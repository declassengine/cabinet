W.M.(43) 2nd Meeting 5th January 1943

Food Stocks for Relief.

M/F. Raised because practical problem for my mission in Washington.

Tho’ financially not after all immediate, still practical problems for my people – cf. telegram fr. Wickard.

Problem is food, rather than free food, for Europe.

Americans are asking.

P.M. Who?

M/F. Wickard – admittedly not fr. U.S Govt.

M/F. U.S. about to ration in order to build up stocks. They want our support in putting this across to their people. What can we offer? Proximity, organisation, a little food. Small in compn. with U.S. contributions. I want to be able to show willing. I want to say little more than P.M. said in 1940. Joint decln. by the 2 countries will relieve uneasiness of Dutch and Norwegians. Decln. tht. we will not revert to unlimited consumptn. until immed. necessities of Europe met.

If we don’t continue rationing. after the war, we shall have v. serious trouble.

Therefore make a virtue of necessity.

There will be some reserves in U.K. at end of war – e.g. the corned beef.

Reason for my change of view is tht U.S. are now contemplating the introduction of rationing.

A.E. Difference also that this proposal is for a joint declaration.

K.W. President is not, as supposed, about to make genl. statements (as in memo). Not opposed to joint decln. in suitable terms, but no need to rush in now. Don’t know what President’s eventual decision may be.

M/Ag. Size of problem. If war ends early ’44 and assuming no transport difficulties, world supplies (other than wheat) will not give Europe a ration of ½ our rations. When that is realised, won’t there be demand from our own people tht. we should help. B. agriculture can still increase its prodn. –

44

by 15% this year and a future 20% in 1944 – given labour and fertilisers. We cd. then allow world supplies to go to Europe.

Prob. 3 years before cereal prodn. in Europe is adequate ) on most

Prob. a generation or a generation and a half cattle populn.) favourable

in Europe is adequate ) assumptions.

We cd. also provide some cattle and eg. vegetable seeds.

20m (out of 354 m. popn. in Europe) only cd. be catered for out of the U.S. proposed stock pile.

S/Doms. Shd. we not ask Doms. what contribution they cd. make, by accumulating stocks.

P.M. Why shd we bind ourselves to rationing more severe than U.S. impose upon themselves?

S/Doms. If we liberate Europe, we shan’t want to see it starving under our administns.

P.M. We have done our share already. Don’t bind ourselves in advance.

B/T. Other commodities. Here we cd. help w’out hurt to ourselves – e.g. wool (9 months’ supply here : 3 yrs in Aust.) and cotton (1 years’ supply here : 2 years’ overseas).

P.M. Do we want to pledge ourselves in advance to give away our only liquid assets?

B/T. Don’t want to promise free gifts. Many countries cd. pay.

Also med. supplies, Army etc, clothing and boots.

Our total contribn. cd. thus be not inconsiderable even to recipients.

P.M. By comparison with weight of European misery, not really significant.

Support M/F. proposal that we shd. get what value we can fr. a joint declaration.

Make it clear tht. there is something we can do and we will do it.

L.P.S. Telegram fr. Halifax 22/9.

Debate in H/Lords.

45

Important to avoid impn. tht U.S. are only people doing anything in this field.

Not hypocritical to make proposed statement abt. continuance of rationing, tho’ words in M/F. go too far. “Anything in our power, wthr. in rationing or otherwise, to help …..” vice M/F. words.

M/Ag. U.S. proposed contribution in terms of their production.

Meat = 2% of 1942 production.

Eggs = 4% “

Milk = 1½% “

Citrus = 5% “

Potatoes = 11% “

Beans = 8% “

M/P. No harm in genl. decln. with no mention of rationing. We can bld. up stocks of some commodities here and in Empire. We can promise contribution from those stocks.

A.E. a) post-war relief shd. be international and not American.

b) food in U.S. Soon will be shortages. Rationing will be necessary.

Referred to telegram of 3/1 fr. Halifax.

All we need to say is (i) if we have stocks, we will make some use of them. (ii) something, jointly with U.S. abt. our food policy.

On these grounds strongly support M/F. proposal.

H.O. Endorsed a). If we can get joint decln. with U.S. that is an advance.

Such a decln. wd. be item of political warfare, both now and in post-war period when we shall need source of authority in Europe.

V. important psychol. tht. at end of war we shd. not let go and each look

x/ for most luxurious life we can find. We shall get into real trouble that way.

Wise proposal provided we can get U.S. into it jointly. Good thing also for U.S. to get into right mood, as at x/.

K.W. Don’t dissent. Question of terms and time.

A.E. M/F. only suggests announcement when U.S. is ready. All we want is to discuss now for announcement there.

46

K.W. Let President decide wthr. he wants to keep this separate from Lend Lease.

A.E. Only ques. is wthr. conversations shd. proceed on this basis.

K.W. Find out wthr. President really wants this now.

P.M. What parity between U.S. and U.K. in a joint decln. ?

S/Doms. It need not be U.K. alone : it must include the Dominions.

M/P. Shipping diffy. cuts both ways. It means tht. we are piling up stocks overseas.

P.M. Ready to say we won’t be behind the U.S. in imposing restn. on ourselves for the sake of a starving Europe.

L.P. If relief isn’t done in an organised way, we shall come off v. badly.

K.W. This shd. be taken up on a much higher level than the Combined Food Boards. We shd. ascertain the personal intentions of the President.

M/W.T. Shipping wd. prob. prevent us fr. lifting stocks fr. 5. Doms. for some time after the war.

C. Ascertain 1) wthr. decln. wd. embarrass President.

2) if wanted, genl. decln. on lines suggd. by M/P.

3) re rationing, will go as far as do the U.S.A.

M/P. Draft a genl. decln. on stocks (omitting rationing) and ask Hal. wht. President has in mind.

M/Ag. Remember that U.S. adminn. wish to use accumulation of stocks as argument to induce U.S. people to accept rationing. It is in our interest that U.S. shd. introduce rationing.

P.M. a) Willing to say we are not going to be behind U.S. or any other country in clarity, self sacrifice and philanthropy.

You will prejudice chance of war-time rationing in U.S. by tying it up with post-war rationing.

M/F. I’m guided by the views of people in U.S. Halifax and my people both say this will be helpful to President.

47

C. What limit wd. you specify for rationing. To what wd. you pledge yourself?

M/F. That’s not the ques. It is a ques. of not allowing unrestricted consumption.

P.M. Willing also to say that we will ration after the war to the extent U.S. ration.

K.W. Refer Halifax to Phillips’ telegram of 29/12.; and ask him wthr. it really wd. help President to have a declaration (in terms not to be specified).

M/F. Ask what kind of decln. wd. help President to get the stock piles going.

P.M.’s conclusions - a) above

b) ascertain President’s views via Hopkins

c) “ views of Dom. Govts.

M/F. If we don’t get U.S. to reduce their consumption, we shall be in a v. bad way.

We shall lose the eggs and dried milk we are getting now.

It will not be shipping then, but supply tht. will be the bottle-neck.

What I want to do is to strengthen hands of U.S. in bldg. up a stock pile.

A.E. U.S. will want fr. us some decln. about stocks.

M/F. Don’t proceed with c) until you get answer to b).

S/Doms. agreed.
