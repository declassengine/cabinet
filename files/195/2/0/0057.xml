A.E. “Tender advice assuming that if force is necessary it will be used.” Say so now.

M/P. Add we have had to reach this decn w’out considering mil. advice: act if you have to: but if you can wait 24 hrs. give us a chance to re-consider &amp; confirm after considering mil. advice.

Funeral &amp; memorial service. Winant wants it here. Awkward because C.I.G.S. etc., won’t be here. Announced absence on 12/5. Will talk to Winant about this.
