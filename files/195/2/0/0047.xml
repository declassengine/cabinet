W.M.(43) 52nd Meeting 12th April. 1943

Burma.

P.M. Don’t ask for large political decisions about countries wh. we haven’t yet recovered from the enemy.

Better progress of Americans v. Japs.

Bruce. U.S. didn’t do so v. well - had to bring in Australians.

C.I.G.S. Getting informn now re. N.Guinea for help of B. troops in Burma. Casualties in Burma: 5.000 or so excluding sick. (Play down our reverses and make a better plan.)

Foreign Affairs.

A.E. Polish-Russian negotiations - going ill - instructg. C. Kerr to take up in Moscow. Otherwise Pols will declare their posn publicly.

P.M. Must try to get R. to let the P. women &amp; children of P. soldiers go. Esp. when R. short of food.

A.E. Polish-Am. relief: some Pols getting better food than some R.: has provoked R.

P.M. Polish force in Persia will lose its morale if the women etc., aren’t allowed to come out.

Tunisia.

P.M. Credit for success in N. Africa due in part to excellent staff-work at W.O., that much abused Dept. At the right moment, I propose to say something to that effect.

Parliamentary Questions.

A.V.A. Ques. by Duncan for Wed: report fr. junior Offrs. abt. Flying capacity of Barracudas.

I have said the Ques. shd. not be allowed.

- Agreed.

Bruntisfield has flown in one: &amp; warmly commends them.

151

P.M. Tanks. We’ve gone in for manoeuverability via heavy armour. That suited the desert: it won’t suit the next phase.

C.I.G.S. But the gun has beaten the tank. Can’t use them in all circs. as before.

P.M. Still the bias shd. be twds armour via speed. - at least in some of them.

Must have confces on tanks.

Tho’ no results will mature this year.

Shackling.

A.E. Barren of ideas - can only close down the exchange, by a flat negative. Will produce a draft - statement in H/C next week.

Home Guard.

P.M. If we send Army out, security at home will turn on H.G. Important therefore to stress, for enemy consumption, strength &amp; efficiency of H.G. Shortly 14/5 anniversary of foundation of H.G. Let us have H.G. Week - as for R.A.F. tho’ of course on more modest scale.

Reviews - parades - 10.000 in Hyde Park etc.

40 practice rounds this year, via 10.

W.O. Two troubles – Tho’ Publicity, apart fr. parades, can easily be arranged. Broadcost message fr. P.M. cttee.

a) Just issued instns damping ‘em down - 1st interest prodn therefore cut down parades. Wd. prefer Church Parades on 16/5.

P.M. No point in that because no weapons.

W.O. If on Fri. you wd. take 1.000.000 out of production.

b) Organised on platoon basis - v. large org. reqd. there to get a big parade concentrated on the one spot.

H.O. Parade wd. do v. good deal of good qua morale &amp; self-respect - to judge fr. C.D. experce.

M/I. To put the story to invader, v. desirable to have these show parades. If done on Sunday p.m. not inconsistent with recent damping down.

152

P.M. Cd. bring in related C.D. services of N.F.S.

H.O. wd. like to consider that.

View of War Cab. is that maximum effort be made - armed parade.

W.O. to submit proposals.

United Nations Day.

M/I. Enough domestic parades of our own.

H.O. Good - not only for war, but to build up for peace.

W.O. Early notice, if you really want to do it.

P.M. Must do something Metropolis only - 100/150 of each Nation’s forces to march past.

M/I. Edinburgh &amp; Cardiff we’d have to have.

P.M. Do those 3, but report &amp; photograph it thoroughly.

Church Bells.

W.O. Canterbury has asked for Easter Day &amp; Whit Sunday. No objections.

L.P.S. Really needs re-consideration: existing rules are indefusible.

P.M. Relax generally - let W.O. go into the thing &amp; make a sensible plan. Alternatives: sirens, maroons. I will submit a plan.
