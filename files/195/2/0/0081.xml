W.M.(43) 99th Meeting. 14th July, 1943.

French Committee.

P.M. U.S. are getting themselves into diffies. We mustn’t be drawn in - esp. as it wd. look like B. opposn to F.D.R.

U.S. shd. not have made public use of private document giving P.M.’s views of de Gaulle.

I will consider makg. a remonstrance &amp; urging them to lay off.

Fr. Cttee must be alarmed at active hostility of U.S. twds. them.

A.E. Cttee is getting stronger &amp; civilian element gaining ground.

P.M. U.S. will not recognise Cttee because fear tht. de G. will have gt. influence on it.

But their action has effect of strengthening de G’s position.

British Policy in Middle East.

A.E. M/State wanted this.

P.M. Para 12. Use the formula wh. you are sending to Willant (warning to the Jews).

neighbouring Arab countries. in para 12.

Bad hats in State Dpt. will make trouble over every word of it.

M/State. a) U.S. have no policy in M/East. F.D.R.’s adviser Wallace

Murray hates our guts: &amp; his policy is merely to frustrate our policy. Unless we can get closer to them they will go off on their own to promote U.S. infl. there. By frankness we can get them to recognise that this is an area of paramount interest to us.

F.O. memo wd. enable me to deal more frankly with

Americans – if it cd. be accepted at the highest level in U.S.A.

b) Economic interest. M.E.S.C. Our only chance of projecting or influence post-war is thro’ economic side. Wd. therefore like to develop twds M/E. Economic Council via M.E.S.C.

Reasons: scarcity of shipping for 2 years: need for MESC. screening &amp; control/imports

roaring inflation in M/East: will not be controlled by the local Govts. w’out our help &amp; guidance.

get these countries to realise tht. contd assistance depends on their taking it thro’ a M/E. Economic Council.

Wd. therefore advocate explann to U.S. - wd. like it even more

frank - get then to recognise tht. their interest in M/E. is mil cpd. with

ours. Get them to work with us in a team wh. we lead &amp; they take a

257

subordinate role.

Don’t want to go fast - wd. seek Cab. approval at successive stages.

M/P. All right on short run because people don’t want to export.

But when people do want to export &amp; importg. Countries have to pay, then strain will come.

M/State. Trouble also about U.S. ambitions re oil.

If we were frank with U.S. about oil -

P.M. Why open up these wide ques. At the peace we’ll know how much each of us counts. We don’t need U.S. help in this area, &amp; aren’t likely to see many of them there from now on.

M/S. Much underground activity by U.S. in oil in this area.

H.O. Bad record of U.S. oil magnates in interfering with politics. Their form of imperialism. e.g. civil aviation. Apart fr. this memo. I had thought this was main factor in creating ill-feeling betwn. us &amp; U.S.: and wd. have wished this taken up with U.S. (F.D.R.)

P.M. Our rights in oil are settled - best leave it alone. Stand on our rights &amp; Stonewall.

W.O. B. &amp; American oil cos. are always concession-hunting in M/East &amp; India.

S/Doms. Approach via State Dpt. wd. be dangerous. Approach (verbal) to F.D.R. first wd. be better.

A.E. I wd. talk to Winant first: seek his advice: prs. wd. send it privately to F.D.R. or Hull.

S/Doms. Wd. rather begin with talk.

F.O. Halifax cd. begin by talk. Document of this sort wd. be necessary as instns to Halifax for verbal conversations.

I.S.A. Why detail? Enough to make them see tht. we regard M/E. as vital to us qua communications, as the Monroe Doctrine to them.

M.A.P. Let Hal. Open it and see what kind of document may be needed later.

Economic Council. Can’t this grow gradually out of M.E.S.C..

S/Air. Shd. this include civil aviation?

M/State. Not my idea.

258

S/Doms. Consult Dom. Govts. before action taken. EEB. to summarise for further discn.

Bombing of Rome.

P.M. Lord Fitzalan on behalf of R.C.’s protested v. bombing Rome.

May be better things to do than bomb it.

G. will give us 24 hrs’ notice before he does so.
