H.O. Trickle still coming here at 10.000 a year. Agree many came to fight. But remember tht. when you get more than a certain no. you begin to generate anti-Semitism.

A.E. Draft to Stalin by P.M. Unhappy about it.

Handed in P.M.’s draft and own alternative.

Read P.M.’s message about his own draft.

I had taken a less optimistic view of Stalin’s message.

M.A.P. I took optimistic view, not because it was friendly (wh. it wasn’t), but because it was so frank.

A number of drafting amendments suggested by various Ministers.

L.P. Have you dropped the point about definition of “Polish subjects”?

A.E. No. Proposed to send separate telegram to Clerk-Kerr.

L.P. Won’t this telegram appear to concede the point.
