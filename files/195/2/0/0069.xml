W.M.(43) 83rd Meeting. 9th June, 1943.

III. Trade Disputes Act.

K.W. Recited the facts. Summarised the law.

Special &amp; impartial enquiry into opn of sections 5 &amp; 6 of Act, with a view

to recommns Don’t think you’ll ever settle this unless you take it out of

politics.

Awkward now tht. this move has bn. made. Won’t negotiate with T.U.C.

in view of step taken. Agree we cdn’t negotiate until threat withdrawn.

Since 1927 3 Genl. Elections: why shd. this have bn. raised now?

M/L. Not a matter wh. T.U.C. wd. raise at an election.

Whitely This has not yet gone too far – yet.

Affiliation can’t become effective until Annual Mtg. of T.U.C. in Sept.

P.M. Other action at law?

K.W. Yes: if member of Union applied to courts for injunction

v. P. Workers Union (not T.U.C.) an action wd. lie. Then if succeeded action for contempt wd. lie v. Union.

Ty. have no discretion. They must by statute make the Regs: &amp; under the Regs. they must act.

P.M. Then only fresh legislation cd. alter the situation.

Doubtful if Govt. cd. carry it thro’ H/C. Then H/Lds., who have the weapon tht. they can refuse to prolong the life of H/C.

We must help our friends if we can. Citrine’s speech was a mistake.

M/L. The Trades Council cases are prob. not objectionable &amp; prob. not v. the law. Regret Citrine’s speech. But even if we got over this we still have trouble about the T. Dispute Act. It’s a Co. Union reqd. by law. The Act has bn. ignored in R.O.F.’s - wh. cdn’t have bn. run otherwise. And v. many est. C. Serv. are in T. &amp; G. Workers’ Union.

Claim used to be for repeal of whole Act. Now demand only repeal of 2 sections. If this were settled, the rest of the Act wd. stand as an agreed Act.

K.W. Ty. have no feelings.

Conserv. support of Act strengthened by action of T.U.C. in defying the law.

Strong feeling. T.U.C. have bn. trying 4 yrs: limited now to 2 sections: don’t want to create diffies, but feel they’re bn. ignored: they believe P.M’s own view is tht. SS. 5 &amp; 6 cd. be reviewed. 218

b) Do nothg. to bring it to a head - let risks sink in.

b) Govt’s duty to Civil Servants – if this course doesn’t produce results

wh. we hope, Govt. shd. make it clear to C. Servants what their posn will

be if the Unions persist. They shd. be told that automatic loss of pensions

etc.

A.E. Bring up in 3 week’s time.

P.M. I take that view &amp; wd. use my influence to get Cons. to agree. But v. diff. for me to do that now that T.U.C. have used threat. Reckless behaviour. Feel that a little time shd. pass. Tell Press to play it down. _ _ _ _ _ out of room _ _ _

L.P. “No merit in this”. More in it than I thought before this resolution was passed.

P.M. No reason why postmen shdn’t affiliate - telegraphists wd. be more important.

M.A.P. S. 5 &amp; 6 wdn’t decide wtr postmen joined in Genl. Strike.

M/L. T.U.C. can’t now call Genl. Strike - individual Unions haven’t empowered them to.

P.M. a) Keep temperature as low as poss.

c) If fav. opportunity, &amp; no threat, wd. be disposed to do somethg. about ss. 5 &amp; 6.

S/Doms. Don’t let things drift until Sept. Have an enquiry - after the threat has bn. withdrawn.

P.M.G. P.O. Eng. Union (to-morrow) may reach a difft. decision.

L.P. a) Strength &amp; unanimity of feeling in Cons. Party about ss. 5 &amp; 6.

M/L. But meanwhile say nothing, &amp; don’t bring T.U.C. into this.
