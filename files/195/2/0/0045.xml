W.M.(43) 49th Meeting. 6th April, 1943.

Imperial Conference.

P.M. Raise with Doms. ques. of Imp. Confce - June or July.

Dom. P.M.’s or their repves: India

Popularise “B. Commonwealth &amp; Empire”

Agreed: D.O. to issue invitations.

Town &amp; Country Planning (Interim Development) Bill.

L.P. Ques. at issue: wthr. at this stage to re-distribute functions of l.a.’s

W.S.M. Discussed with l.a.’s, who are anxious to have the Bill: if altered, wd. have to discuss again &amp; some l.a. Assocns wd. oppose.

Postpone review of l.a. functions until larger planning legislation.

P.M. Can you put a risk into inefficient county districts?

W.S.M. E.g. Mersey: B’head &amp; Lipl: we have persuaded them to allow one of our men to make a plan for them both.

Bill provides tht. planning resolution be deemed to be in effect throughout the country.

H.O. a. Great public interest: Govt. will be critised for doing no more than this after havg. Uthwatt &amp; Scott for months. On that satisfied with WS.M.’s arguments. But

b. Wd. prefer transfer of powers in this Bill.

(i) Too many county districts.

(ii) They are too small to take the wider planning view because rates. The County Council more likely to take a broad view.

Politically it wd. help because we cd. say we were doing something big in this Bill.

S/Doms. Agree with H.O. Will run into serious trouble.

141

K.W. More trouble if you do seek to make this change now.

M/H. Wait for policy. Suppose you decide to lead away fr. conflict betwn. town &amp; country: then distinction betwn. county boro’ &amp; county council may be mistaken.

W.S.M. Co. Councils aren’t ideal planning areas. Diffies must be got over by Joint Cttees: &amp; I shall have power to impose them.

P.M. This Bill is sound because preliminary step to something more. Don’t want to begin with a big Bill.

Wd. agree with H.O. if we were at peace (L.P. &amp; W.S.M. said they wd. too). But don’t want to open these large issues at this stage.

Bold social legislation at this stage is out of place now.

S/Doms. Disagreed: blitzed towns urgently require planning reform. good for men in Services to think of these things in spare time. good for Parl. to practise legislation.

M.A.P. Diffy is tht. you sterilise on basis tht. some authies. will be responsible for some time to come. Psychologically open to criticism.

P.M. Meet that by stating war time measure.

L.P. We don’t know yet what we are to put in place of existing authorities. Therefore, go on with this Bill &amp; statement at end of L.P.’s memo.

W.S.M. Won’t prejudice that issue when I speak on this Bill.

P.M. Will this Bill give you power to initiate fr. the top &amp; to correct.

W.S.M. Broadly, yes.

L.P. We shall have Reg. Offrs. for the first time. You must take a/c of the establishment of a Minister with a positive function instead of a merely regulative function.

W.S.M. Power to compel appointmt. of Joint Cttee.

H.O. But has the Joint Cttee power to compel the constituent l.a.’s to agree.

W.S.M. The Joint Cttee is an executive authy for purposes of interim development.

142

H.O. Intolerable tht. a Joint Cttee. shd. impose a rate on a l.a.

P.M. Don’t hurry to introduce this. Let us discuss it once more.

W.S.M. No bldg. any way until after the war. No money yet therefore. Want therefore to get them working on paper.

M/Ag. Urgency = need to stop speculation.

H.O. Admitted there was no Party politics about this - many Labour Members would not agree with my view.

P.M. Emphasise importance of point that no bldg. can take place till after the war.

Agreed: present Bill to be introduced in H/Commons.
