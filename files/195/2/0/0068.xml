W.M.(43) 81st Meeting 5th June, 1943.

Military Situation.

P.M. Lisbon air-service.

C.A.S. Stopped by day.

C.A.S. We must have stiffer rules about flights over Atlantic.

U-Boats.

P.M. Congrats. to Admy. on 34 kills in May.

F.D.R. has suggested monthly statement - then tell Press to say no more. I think this cd. contain somethg. genl. about tonnage lost.

C.N.S. 295.000 May. 34 kills. 9.500 June to today 2 certain 1 prob. kills.

P.M.’s Mission.

P.M. Journey justified - diffce in view point: U.S. masses’ attentn. Turned mainly on Japan &amp; tend to think it more important to keep China in than Russia. At outset sharp diffces betwn. staffs. Suggd tht. concentn on Italy &amp; Med.

wd. interfere with Bolero and wd. even prolong the war. But personal

contacts &amp; personal friendships broke this down &amp; agreement was

reached. This doct. agrees on Italy being the target: but we’ve undertaken

to move some troops back at intervals for Bolero.

Stategic issues settled in broad outline. Whereas a year ago we had to say

“Hitler first &amp; Tojo after” there is now enough force to take a rather difft.

view – a matter of emphasis now, not a choice.

Eisenhower inclined to go for Sardinia before Italy: I strongly advocate

second, then first will fall in. I therefore went to see Eisenhower &amp; took

Genl. Marshall with me. Marshall rewrote the paper for communication to

Russia - W.Cab. shd. see

Anakim - diffces also. We came to concln no reason to re-open Burma Rd. until mid/45. But all the same we must fight, wherever we can engage the enemy. More energy needed on that front, w’in the limits prescribed.

U.S. public hadn’t realised until I said it to Congress tht. greater part of U.S. forces are deployed in Pacific. U.S. Executive treats Congress as an enemy - surprised at the sort of speech I made, tho’ I explained it was common-form for H/Commons.

U.S. opinion quite cool about N. Africa.

Saw Evatt: think he’s coming here. 216

Circulate X] this document: evidence of great mental grasp. His visit to Africa with me has done him good - widened his appn of importance of African campaign.

Alexander &amp; Montgomery were v. confident of success.

Good work of long-range U.S. bombers in daylight. e.g. Trieste cruiser.

Giraud &amp; de Gaulle. V. satisf. Cttee. Gave them all lunch y’day. - and a speech in my best anglicised French. In the new Cttee de G. can count only on Philip for support “right or wrong”: and Catroux &amp; Massigli will keep him on right lines.

Two stages of recognition a) the authy. to whom arms may be given

and money paid. At once.

b) as represtg. France &amp; if so to what

extent F.O. and State Dpt. to consider their document: F.D.R. &amp; I may have to settle. I hope we can go a long way for we need someone to speak to on behalf of France.

F.O. shd. consider what revision shd. be made in lrs. wh. I have sent to de G. from time to time.

A.E. I think de G. will come along all right.

P.M. Alexander came home with us. Wants to remain in private. Better too to allow G. to think he’s still there. Wd. like him to come to War Cab. on Monday. 217
