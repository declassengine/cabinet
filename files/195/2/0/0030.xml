W.M.(43) 33rd Meeting 22nd February 1943

Foreign Affairs.

F.O. Mission flying out to N. Africa.

Air Raids.

H.O. 30 S. Wales and S.W. Tues/Wed. Some concentn. Swansea – widespread damage to Bldgs.

12 killed. 44 ser. injured.

Otherwise attacks fairly small.

Shackling of Prisoners.

A.E. Telegram suggestg it has now become symbolised in some camps. Investigating this : meanwhile we can say nothing more in Parlt.

S.Doms. Was there some alteration in our message?

L.P. Some alteration in tone. W.O. ? Result of re-translation.

A.E. Not intentional : will enquire.

Italian Prisoners of War.

A.E. Shd. have bn. joint memo. with M/I.

Worth while at least to have some of these people available.

Success in N. Africa has made Ital. more willing to take view v. regime.

W.O. To be liberated or remain prs?

A.E. If used, wd. be liberated.

W.O. Then they become traitors in Italy : and relatives exposed to reprisals.

Do we have to inform P. Power?

C.D.S. might eventually want to use them for mil. purposes.

M/Ag. “Utilitarian value” in this country already secured by work on land.

92

Will an agitation in their camps improve their (small) work value.

A.E. Might try it in S. Africa first.

M/Ag. Minority chosen as Pioneer Batns. wd. work better : but others wd. be worse workers.

General feeling : don’t try it here first : develop in India first and then perhaps in B. E. Africa.

W.O. If you liberate and these enlist [as volunteers soldiers] under mil. law, no ques. will arise under General Conventns.

Agreed : nil in G.B. or S. Africa. Extend to B.E. Africa subject to Platts views.

Refugees.

A.E. Rpt. on recent mtg. re Jews. No progress with U.S.A. No immed. chance of direct conversns.

Can we continue to pretend in H/C. tht. we are holding internat. conversns.

We here can do so little tht. difficult for us to take it up internationally unless U.S. co-operate.

H.O. I cd. take 1.000 or so as part of U. Nations move – but only to bring the others on.

Rathbone &amp; Co. all pressing us to admit some to encourage other A. Nations. My feeling is we’ve done too much already w’out guarantee tht. other Nations will help.

Danger of anti-Semitic troubles here.

S/Doms. Advantages of explaing. diffies. in Debate – what we have done, and diffy. of doing more.

W.O. Risk of provoking discussion of Jewish Army.

A.E. Agree advantages. Trouble is disclosure of U.S. delay.

H.O. Arrange Parly. Ques. to P.M. askg. what contribn. we and Empire have made – and give it publicity.

M/L. Can Cab. Sec draft Answer to show what we have done.

93

Agreed: Have Ques. subject to Cab. seeing answer.

Otherwise, stand firm.

Have put to U.S. Chargé d’Affaires last week-end 3 points a) mtg. here. b) Agreed – await replies to these points.

Ch. Whips to be asked to discourage undue interest.

Beveridge Report: Circulation by A.B.C.A.

W.O. Ques. tomorrow askg. if A.B.C.A. pamphlet on Bev. Rpt. will now be circulated.

x/. We did suggest postponement, rather than cancelln. because we thought Debate wd. be non-committal.

Now, however, any discussion in Army must be discussion of Govt’s views on Rpt.

Shall I turn down flat : promise consn. if at any time became practical to discuss coolly : or be more non-committal. indicatg. ultimate decn. likely to be negative.

H.O. Difficult because of x/.

W.O. Cd. circulate Bev. Rpt. + Govt. decisions thereon.

M/L. “Have considered priorities and are circulatg. Uthwatt Rpt. first”!

W.O. Draft will be submitted to P.R. Cttee.

y/. Answer PQ. “Am considering brief with a view to issuing somethg. more suitable”.

Agreed : as at y/.
