W.M.(42) 163rd Meeting 1st December 1942

I. Man Power.

A.V.A. Strong strategical case for demands : but recognise man-power shortage.

Our requirements made no allowance for contingencies. 40%. 50%. 60% due to contingencies in last 3 years.

Don’t see how we can cut serv. personnel – tho’ apptd. Cttee to make cuts.

We will take P.M.’s figure and make it do : so long as Cab. realise a) it will mean retardation of everything but anti U-Boat craft and manning b) extra strategic demands on us will call for further resource.

M/L. Can’t absorb 186 in shipbuilding.

A.V.A. Over 18 months : 57.000 = transferred capacity. Other intake at rate of 88.000 p.a.

Apart fr. transfer. no more intake than in the past.

W.O. a) Army will run down by 100.000 in ’43, taking a/c of wastage and casualties. Since July had to pass to offensive role overseas.

On M/L. figures it will keep its level, on same assumptions re wastage etc.

If a) accepted, no chance of carrying out pr. Directive.

If b) “ , some chance of keepg. up offensive strength by cutting out anti-invasion prepns.

S/Doms. Shdn’t M/L have increased M/S. pro rata?

M/L. No. Because M/S. programmes taper off before Army does.

M/S. So far as requirmts. are cut, we can make a saving.

I assume a) cut in requirements

b) withdrawal of man-power mainly after June ’43.

By then we can hope to get a) settled in detail.

c) Not to be given to M/L. local office as a mandate.

Subject to these, don’t raise violent objn.

11

W.O. We shall have to improve cuts in our requirements on M/S. otherwise we can’t do what you ask.

P.M. Admy. heavy shell – over 6 inch. Return of stock and consumption up to date + production. But you’re banking on more than you’ve figures up to date.

Return to be made.

R.A.F. S/Air: Effect of loss of 75.000 to M.A.P. will be 2500 bombers in 2 years.

= 30.000 men and women on personnel

30.000 on economies

20.000 on training organisation

5.000 works squadrons cut by 50%

20.000 R.A.F. Regt. cut by 25%

15.000 cut in Balloon Command. Public reaction

15.000 15% cut in Fighter Command

25.000 M/East. 34 squadrons cut fr. expansion. 10/12 U.S.

squadrons there now &amp; 44 eventually.

50.000 India. 48 Squadrons cut fr. expansion

5.000 W. Africa

P.M. 502 on 31/12/43.

C.A.S. About 100 by then : 140 by mid ’44.

S/Doms. Use Indians to man squadrons in India.

S/Air. We’re trying to expand our training organisation. Will take time.

We don’t know how many aircraft M/P. may have got out of U.S. If he gets many. M.A.P. shd. have use, &amp; we more men.

C.A.S. These are not hard &amp; fast decisions – we may want to spread differently.

M.A.P. S/Cripps.

Our calculns. by Dept. 75 redn = 2.500 heavy bombers by end ’44.

150 redn. = 5.000 “ “ “ “

Don’t believe these figures are watertight. Haven’t had time to go into it myself.

Wd. hope for economies in industry wh. wd. balance a cut of 75.000.

12

Intake rate : depends on mobility etc. have taken in 29.000 in past : with larger industry : greater potential dilution believe we cd. absorb at required increased rate.

M/L. Was hoping for greater efficiency fr. this industry.

When we have put in more than 20/25.000 we have had complaints tht,. they aren’t put to work. Managements. haven’t bn. made to use their head.

Take 25.000 a month to end June : then look for more on transfer from M/Supply.

M.A.P. Want the increased man-power early – meanwhile can improve efficiency and then later we won’t want so many more.

C.A.S. Loss to M.A.P. will be on heavy bombers mainly – may mean 20 squadrons by end ’43.

M/L. Put M.A.P. to 100 cut : leaving R.A.F. with 225

M.A.P. Agreed.

Civil Defence.

P.M. Not askg. H.O. to bear sole responsibility. Glad to take that myself.

M/L. What view about gas warfare :

P.M. Can be cut down.

M/L. Large nos. employed. What prepns. are G. making for anti-gas?

P.M. Anti-gas might be looked into. Offensive gas however is already up to saturation point : prodn. cd. be suspended.

H.O. Decontamination – almost all 1.a. employees.

Anti-gas prodn. down to bare requirements.

If C.O.S. &amp; M/Defence give me a lower risk, v. well. But any night he cd. send 40 over – even tho; much weaker – I must be ready all over the country.

Nos. in 1940/41 were not more than needed. We have since then cut down – as at top of p.2.

13

Room for cut in London. But S. Wales v. few whole timers. N.F.S. is thin on the ground &amp; fire risk is enormous. Bolero shd. increase the risks in certain areas of concentration.

Modest squeeze only.

P.M. You cdn’t have an assurance they won’t do it. They will. But they won’t do it often or heavy. Scale and frequency will be substantially less than in 40/41. The risks are less : you can’t have the same insurance.

N. African front will draw off G. aircraft.

M/L. Wd. take 50/60.000 – if w’out tags to them.

H.O. Cdn’t give you that figure.

L.P. But you have made do with part-timers in S. Wales &amp; in Scotland.

P.M. Make a scheme to yield 100.000 and we’ll see what’s involved.

M/L. Will you need all the airfields wh. we are bldg?

Do the Army still need so much bldg?

Shd. Bolero programme be reviewed in light of U.S. latest attitudes.

Won’t much of U.S. effort now go to N. African Front.

P.M. Civil Defence, purely defensive = ⅓ of R.A.F.

L.P. Why not apply to C. Defence the conception of dual-purpose Army.

Agreed. H.O. to explore with L.P.

P.M. 3.160.000 RAF and M.A.P.

4.180.000 Army and Supply

Let the 2 pairs consider how they cd. adjust inter se.

P.M. Let Dpts. tell me what wd. be effect of my original proposals.

Government Staffs.

L.P. M/Home Security to rank as Service Dept. for this purpose.

S/Doms. Clerical labour in munitions industries.

14

P.M. In next few days – heads of proposals showg. how to meet the cuts.

On the basis of printed figures save 100 to M.A.P.

War Cab. again a week today.
