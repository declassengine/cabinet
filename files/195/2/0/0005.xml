W.M.(42) 164th Meeting 3rd December 1942

I. Position of Italy.

A.E. Little diff. betwn. P.M’s memo and mine. Save this –

If your forecasted events occur, then follow a nil. commitment to help her.

P.M. Not automatically. If it begins to fight G. and ask our help, our decision cd. await on circs.

C.O.S. referred to dangers of commitment. But it will be for us to decide in the event. Is Malta a commitment or an asset? A worthwhile commitment is an asset.

Musso. may be able to hold the country down – with his Fascist control + Gestapo.

A.E. Peace-feelers fr. Italy.

M/L. No names shd. be mentioned. Danger of securing peace while rivelting Fascism on Italy.

P.M. Not prepared to tie my hands to deal only with non-Fascists. Enormous advantage to us if Italy came out, whatever the political complexion of the men who lead her out.

P.M. U.S. v. anxious to deal with Italy and bring her out of the war. They are going pretty strong on this line.

H.O. Are we not leaving too much of the political shaping of N. Africa to the U.S.A.?

Don’t let’s leave too much to them as regards Italy.

At least we must be in on it fr. the start.

A.E. Darlan’s decln. is unilateral inspiration of his own – and I have said so, in H/Commons.

But I wd. like to ask U.S. wthr. they knew and what they think.

H.O. Has Eisenhower got competent political advisers?

M/L. Are we going to be excluded fr. Dakar?

16

P.M. U.S. view = B. hated and U.S. loved everywhere. This (+our attitude) leads the Darlans to cling to the Americans.

A.E. As rgds. Italy. we must wait and see what man will emerge. We shan’t try to build up Ghandi or anyone else.

H.O. Our x/ in para 14. I wd. have thght we cd. begin to provoke reaction v. Fascism.

A.E. Disintegration yes – but no anti F. element to deal with after 20 yrs. of Fascism.

Peace feelers fr. Italy. Minnows so far.

Propose not to pursue any of these at present. Promise nothing in advance.

Will, however, tell U.S. and Russia for what is worth : ask if they’ve heard anything.

P.M. Agreed – let us look at the posn. when it arises.

Albania. Proposal approved.

Prisoners of War.

S/Doms. Telegram fr. Canada 2/12.

This decision reached after they had seen German Govt’s reply.

P.M. You will doom our men to indefinite shackling.

Their condn. was apology and undertakg. about tying men in action.

It was a Cab. decision &amp; C.R.A. agreed with it. Now you want to back out.

Canada is behavg. v. badly.

A.E. They are going ahead &amp; announce. That will queer our pitch.

We must act with them.

P.M. I’m ready to surrender.

A.E. But let’s do it on basis of appeal by Swiss – ask Swiss to make this appeal. Read out text of proposed telegram to Swiss –

17

a) repudiating G. Note : measures only taken with object of procuring a mitigation of harsh treatment inflicted on B. prs.

b) if they will ask both Govts. to unshackle on a given day, we will act immediately.

P.M. “On/contrary as wce at disp. of P.P. will show they have observed in strictest manner every provn. of the Convention [have immed. remedied anything to wh. P.P. have drawn attentn.”] [I was queried. “Any conflict has always reqd. immed. attentn.”

A.E. Announce when Swiss appeal comes in. Urge them to do it v. quickly.

P.M. Telegram telling Doms. wht. we have done and askg. no independent action meanwhile.

Foreign Service.

P.M. Cab. Cttee to try to reach an agreement. Composition - ? interested parties.

A.E. Don’t want to re-open decision taken by War. Cab. 18 months.
