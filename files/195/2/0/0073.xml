W.M. (43) 91st Meeting. 1st July, 1943.

I. Food Conference.

A.E. Decision only on form of statement.

L.P. Our repve on Interim Commn. You’ll be asked.

L.P.S. Debate in H/L on Tues. next.

A.E. Try then to make the announcement then. Question time.

M/Ag. Hope Rpt. of Conference will be published as White Paper as well as Resolutions.

L.P. Shd. be published.

Diffy. will be to get U.S. to comply, esp. with Resn 12. - problem of next few years = to get U.S. to speed up their agricultural prodn &amp; re-adjust their balance.

L.P. Danger of Relief Comb Organn getting into central and dominant posn to prejudice of C??? Bds.: &amp; then finding there’s not enough food in the world to relieve Europe - as there won’t be. Danger also: the Organn will take line tht. job of relief - provide food for all countries wh. can’t pay for it with exports - incldg. us among those eligible for relief.

Memo. accepted.

II. Post-war Agricultural Policy.

P.M. This Motion goes beyond existg. Govt. undertakg. New decision if we agree to support.

S/D. No mention of fair prices to consumers.

P.M. Implies quotas - is this consistent with our Comm. Policy &amp; Buffer Stocks.

Gives high place to fertility of soil.

Final words commit us to country w’out balancing favour to the towns.

Vague &amp; general - but will be construed as a pledge.

Cdn’t this be Debated w’out a Motion.

Ch. Whip. Must have a Supply Day anyhow.

Considering wtr. rules re Supply may be widened to enable discns on post-war matters to be discussed - now debarred by rule re not discussg. matters involvg. legn. 229

P.M. H/C. shd. have opportunities for full discn of these post-war problems w’out getting tied up with Motions.

Ch. Whip. Either amendmt. of S. Orders or by stereotyped form of Motion.

Whitely. Speaker has recently allowed more latitude on this point, as war-time measure.

K.W. Try &amp; get this settled before this agric. debate.

P.M. Say - in order tht. the discn may be free, the day will be counted as Ag. Supply Day pro forma, but will put down a simple Motion on wh. the Debate can run.

M.A.P. Take care not to stop thereby discussion of adminn.

Ch. Whip. Try to get it settled by end of next week.

{ We’ve resisted most of these Motions: they will prob. be content if

x { they get the Day’s Debate.

Agreed: try x/ first. New procedure.

[ If not, Minister shd. hatch Motion wh.wd. be acceptable.]

[ Or refuse discussions on a Motion (this wd. be difficult).]

III. Post-War Shipping.

Whitely. Labour Party want it. Supply Day: no motion.

P.M. Cdn’t agree to nationalisation of shipping. Much to be said for state control rlways, electricity, gas, some mines etc., - monopolistic public utilities.

Not afraid of that - not unsound.

Shipping much more Kittle-cattle - lives by v. narrow margins &amp; enterprise. Not a good specimen to put on the list.

A.V.A. Diffy = Govt. subsidy of other powers. If we give such subsidies there will be demand for control.

P.M. Then Govt. directors.

S/D. Dangers of transfer to foreign flags.

P.M. Praised para. 3(ii) of Memo. This is a good answer to criticism.

M/W.T. Greenwood &amp; Shinwell are satisfied with this.

230

H.O. Labour Party may not press for natn of shipping: but no hint here of any position policy.

M/W.T. Don’t want to open up publicly until we’ve gone further with U.S.A.

P.M. Line shd. be tht. Govt. is not so composed as to be able to make a decln on this subject.

A.E. Para 3 gives a line for Govt. spokesman.

M/W.T. Noel Baker wd. be happy to follow this line. Salter cd. join in later.

Debate is better restricted to this topic only.

IV. Constitution of Malta.

C.O. Want merely to say now tht. after the war we will give them back what they had before l933. The old diffies are over. There may be new ones.

Agreed.

V. General Giraud.

A.E. Giraud going to U.S. 14/7. Wants to return via N. Route. Scotland. Macmillan suggests we shd. invite him here. Wd. like to: but will it arouse suspicions that we favour him at expense of others. Wd. inflame de Gaullists unnecessarily.

P.M. Wiser to ask him to return to Gib. direct. Unwise for him to go at all: wise to return as soon as he can.

M.A.P. We shd. do all we can to strengthen the hands of the Cttee. - esp. the civilians.

P.M. Yes for arms &amp; money (if they need it). But U.S. won’t agree to our negotiating with them.

A.E. Build up civil power against the Genls.

Agreed: advise Giraud to return via Gib. - adding tht. we think he wd. be wiser to stay in Africa.

VI. Rural Cottages.

P.M. This story is a reproach - tho’ due to efficiency of our war-machine. Repns by Winterton. 231

L.P. Don’t think it’s been handled with due urgency. But M/H. being unfairly attacked. He did not put to us proposn tht. these shd. be built as emergency Govt. scheme. He made it clear tht. he wd. build thro’ l.a.’s. I think tht. tho’ working thro l.a.’s they shd. have done it on emergency basis. 232
