W.M.(43) 54th Meeting. 14th April, 1943.

I. Supplies to Turkey.

P.M. List proposed derisory. Far more eg. tanks cd. be supplied by M/East. They have 3.000 &amp; 8th Army has only 600.

W.O. Based on shipping &amp; what Turks can absorb.

P.M. Won’t do. Army is using v. little of what it has in M/East.

Wd. ruin our policy. Must examine in detail - most niggardly list.

Say - following (good list) are available as soon as you can take them, &amp; let the absorbtion capacity put on its own brake.

A.E. A.S.E. mtg. this p.m. - will look at it on this basis.

P.M. I’m having this examined fr. pt/view of our scale of production. Will meet on Friday at noon.

II. Naval Construction Programme.

A.V.A. Losses of destroyers - 7 + 12 damd in Torch: more expected in Torch.

P.M. The more reason for more small destroyers via fewer large.

A.V.A. See para. 8. Only 51% of requirements by end/44.

16/18 mos. fr. time of laying down. for intermed/battle destroyers.

P.M. Bldg. an ideal Fleet - not for condns of war, as you will find it.

C.N.S. These vessels will also be needed for war in Pacific, wh. may go on after ’44.

P.M. Believe it a mistake: but won’t press my point further.

Agreed.

III. Policy in Burma.

P.M. Thrown out twice - why ca’t we wait till we see some chance of getting into posn to decide fate of Burma.

158

L.S.A. No public announcement - but those going in must have some idea of future &amp; pol. warfare people must know what they can say. Not askg. For fresh promises: askg. leave to go back on promises given. Letter sent to U. Saw, with authy. of War Cab., promised in effect progress twds. Dom. status. Important to make it clear tht. is no longer an early prospect: we’ll have to retain direct control for period of years. F.O. agree this wd. help with U.S. opinion, if we specify period I suggest 7 years. Good for a) B. opinion, b) our re-constn Staff with D. Smith.

Second point = financial help fr. here. Ty. have agreed some of this eg. damage suffered by commercial etc., firms.

Re-establishing B. firms in Burma &amp; priming pump for B. B.Trade.

Want only general approval of principles now - refer again before any public announcement., wh. won’t perhaps be necessary until we re-occupy Burma.

Broad principles - a period of direct Govt. is to intervene after re-occupn &amp; we will during that do our best to restore B.’s commerce, trade etc.

P.M. I will oppose giving money to B. on basis of getting out as soon as poss. thereafter.

S/Doms. Basis for pol. warfare = we are going to re-conquer B. &amp; some time thereafter will move twds. Constitutional reform.

Planning: may require decision v 7 yr. interval. But that isn’t requd for pol. warfare.

L.P. Constitutly B. is now responsible for internal adminn. We must tell the Govr. now whtr. we are going to have direct Govt.

P.M. Before agreeing to liberate Burma, we shall ask what other countries will do about their possessions in N.East.

H.O. At present, pol. warfare won’t be convincing, because of mil. situation. On substance, memo. not consistent. Para. 1. of Annex is not consistent with para. 9 of memo. This is humbug.

L.S.A. Don’t want decision to-day about 7 years. All I want is tht. period of direct Govt. will intervene after war, &amp; tht. measure of fin. help can be relied upon for re-constn. This for Govr’s. informn. ? only.

P.M. This will give you worst of both worlds.

159

Offend U.S. opinion. Hold ‘em down with one hand, repair with other, &amp; after 7 years give it all away.

Tell Govr. that if decided tht. B. infl. shall remain in B., there will of course be period while we rule direct &amp; we shall help with the work of re-construction.

L.S.A. Can Govr. work on assumptn. that , if B. is to remain under our influence, there will be period of direct rule during wh. he can expect help in reconstruction.

K.W. No financial guarantee of priority in the queue.

W.O. Trade is in hands of Burma Oil, Burma Corpn &amp; Steel Bros. They want to know where they are.

P.M. “You are Dormant, Smith: &amp; you lie there meanwhile with yr. skeleton staff.”

Agreed - L.S.A. to instruct accordly.
