W.M.(43) 94th Meeting. 7th July, 1943.

I. Enemy Leaders and War Criminals – Warning to Neutrals not to grant Asylum.

A.E. If desired to stop them going to neutral countries, better warn the neutrals now than try to dig them out later. But no strong feelings if not disposed to press the point post-war.

P.M. F.D.R. inclined to let our troops shoot them out of hand!

I suggested U.N. to draw up list of 50 or so who wd. be declared as outlaws by the 33 Nations. (Those not on list might be induced to rat!) If any of these found by advancing troops, nearest offr. of Brigade rank shd. call a military court to establish identity &amp; shd. then execute w’out higher authority.

Simon Earlier public declaration by Allies “Punishment of war criminals …. lists …. Armistice terms shd include provn for their surrender. FDR has signed this.

P.M. My scheme wd. be a refinement on that.

Simon. Distinctn. Between leaders H &amp;M. (political ques) and list of blackguards proved guilty of bestial behaviour. Second class = concern of the U.N. Commission for Investigations of War Crimes. We have selected our member &amp; others are doing so (incldg. U.S.).

S/Doms. Hand over to most injured nations like Norway &amp; Poland.

M.A.P. Private rather public warning.

A.E. That is an arguable point, I agree.

L.P.S. Debate in H/Lds. (Vansittart) 14/7.

S/Doms. Quns at mtgs.

A.E. Consult U.S.A. &amp; main U. Nations &amp; if they agree give warning privately to neutrals most concerned. Then tell Vansittart in confidence. (E.g. warn Switzerland because of Italians. Sweden also because G.)

Simon. Neutrals concerned, not so much v H &amp; M., but in the smaller man who have done bestial things. Allied Govts. are v. keen that some warning shd. be given.

240

P.M. Premature to take any action. ? Postpone for 6 months. Time not ripe even for private warning. Wd. prefer to win a few battles first.

A.E. May I ascertain wtr. U.S. and other main Allies wd. favour a private

x/ warning &amp; wtr. they think it cd. be given soon? Then we cd. avert debate in H/L on grd. tht. we were in discn with Allies.

P.M. When time ripe, wd. prefer to proceed by Resolution of 33 Nations. Again in 3 months. Meanwhile x/ with U.S.A. informally.

II. States of Tibet.

A.E. Guidance to our rpres. needed on lines indicated.

P.M. Agreed: v. necessary.

III. Copperbelt: Mr Maybank.

O.S. S. African Unions refused to touch the case, after investigation.

M/L. I agreed to his removal for fear of a) bloodshed in our territory

b) trouble with the Congo.

And I am prepared to defend the action taken.

Dalgleish of my Union was one of investigators – quite satisfied.

O.S. Maybank living here - quite free. Independent means, made by speculation on Australian Stock Exchange.

P.M. Why not in Army?

M/L. Will consider - after Sept. Congress of T.U.C.!!

IV. Sikorski - Public Funeral.

P.M. Had thought a public funeral - to be organised by the Poles, with mil. honours.

Agreed - A.E. to take the initiative, with help of small Cttee. incldg. H.O. and W.O. Official Cttee to report to F.O. H.O. &amp; W.O. (Ministers).

V. Union of Democratic Control.

A.E. Mtg. held by Communists under Ld. Marley, at wh. violent attacks of Yugoslavs.

H.O. Answered a ques. last week discouraging meddling in these affairs.

241

A.E. Don’t want any more attacks on Michaelovich – prs. next it will be v. King/Greece.

M.A.P. Reflection of Russian suspicions of Michaelovich.
