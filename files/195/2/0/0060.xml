Foreign Affairs.

A.E. R. Polish nothg. Important to report.

Telegram fr. P.M. - read. Prevent newspp. bickering - ? warn D.Worker it will be suppressed again. Best chance for Poles = keep mouths shut. Good thing for Sikorski to visit his troops in M/East.

All that is happening. But pressure fr. Poles.

M/Inf. Cd. say in H/C. tomorrow: we’re preventing D.Worker fr. being exported. Messages offens. to U.N. not to be telegraphed abroad. They will curse us for that. No ques of threatening suppression.

H.O. Maisky might be told he can’t complain about Pol. press while D.Worker is under his Govt’s orders. Fair retort.

M/L. Don’t acknowledge to Foreign Amb. tht. he can interfere with

B. newspaper.

L/P. H.O. means merely “remind him how D.Worker reviles us: don’t complain of Poles.”

Foreign royalties asked for 5.50. Others shd. therefore be there by 5.45.

Ch.Whip. May Clerk &amp; Serj. Arms be authd to inform applicants of change of time.

S/Doms. Will move this is a v. short speech.

M/L. If you mention names, give a show to Anderson &amp; 1st Army.

W.O. Weekes: some comment at top: Anderson is receivg. protests tht.

1st Army hasn’t had a fair deal.

M/I. 5 columns in D.Express in praise of 1st Army.

Draft approved.

Electoral Machinery – Report of Committee.

H.O. a) Shd. decision await P.M.’s return? More convenient for me not to wait.

S.Doms. Take provisional decisions &amp; cable for P.M.’s approval.

Agreed: don’t worry him.

K.W. Don’t press my point of view - but little pressure.

Adjourned.

P.M. Invitation to Visit Mexico.

A.E. Message asking P.M. to go on to Mexico.

“Hardly worth while. They asked me &amp; I didn’t.”

Agreed.

191

Refugee Debate.

A.E. Wed. Refugee debate. Plan for getting Jews thro’ Bulgaria to Palestine. Some talk of this - result G. have crossed frontier.

Worried because they may get closed Spanish Frontier thro’ wh. we get, not only refugees, but also valuable people - if in Debate there’s talk about getting refugees thro’ Spain.

We can’t v. well debate this in Secret Session.

L.P.S. Why not?

K.W. Cd. you warn them when you go into S. Session for statement on St. Paul’s?

Advantage tht. Parlt. shd. know what’s happened in Bulgaria.

H.O. Favoured whole debate in Secret. Diff. to debate w’out talking about Spain.

K.W. Say to-morrow why you want to hold the whole Debate in Secret.
