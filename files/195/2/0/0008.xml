W.M.(42) 170th Meeting 17th December 1942

I. Building Programmes.

M/P. 115.000 short on programme.

Immed. cut of 15% on value will give us relief needed.

Suggest therefore I shd. examine how cuts can best be shared out.

Not a uniform cut – I will distribute this over-all cut.

M.A.P. Aerodromes included in super pref. works.

M/L. Doesn’t meet me. Airfields stand out in special posn.(43 not started).

Strategic posn. shd. (43 not started) be defined first.

M/P. Can’t do that.

Is Bolero to stand, or be modified.

S/Air. Cd. meet M/L. on this.

Roughly 51 sites under consn. or cleared or ready for requisition etc.

Of these, can say we shan’t want labour for 42. Either we cd. do them ourselves or in N.I. : or U.S. will provide labour. We wd. give up 30/31.

I wd. discuss which with M/Ag.

Leave it to be discussed with Dpts. concerned.

M/L. Shd. we make Bolero provision or not?

Little of accommn. constructed is occupied.

W.O. In reply to P.M.

Assuming 5 Divn. Bolero (490.000) by April 1943.

M/L. difft. is tht. tho’ no. due by Apl. reduced by 50% our instns. stand tht. they will come later. Thus, tho’ work can be postponed, it can’t be cancelled.

£10m. contracts stopped altogether. But still assumg. whole of storage &amp; hospital accommn. will be required.

23

M/L. Morale – main trouble now = living accommn.

M/H. Supported this. a) Houses needg. more than 1st aid repair (w’in limit of £150-£200) : 97.000 : labour was diverted to Bolero.

b) Now at point when modest bldg. of new houses must begin in rural areas. M/Ag. confirmed tht. this was necessary for food prodn.

M/H. Scottish housing problem even more acute.

W.O. Overall redn. of 30% not possible w’out reduction of Bolero programme.

P.M. Scale of Bolero needs re-examination.

M/Ag. Recruitment of Land Girls held up because of lack of houses.

P.M. Disposed to take airfields first : make a 20% cut.

S/Air. My offer wd. meet M/L.

M/L. Yes, it would.

a) 510 in use.

b) 106 under constn.

c) 54 projected.

Can’t give up whole of c). Because e.g. 3 are specially long run-ways for x/ heavy bombers. nr. the coast. We’ve only 1 so far.

P.M. No new ones to be begun w’out further instns.

If, for time being, you finish the 106 : then if you get congested you can tell U.S. to send Army vice A.F. That is worst wh. cd. happen.

S/Air. a) I won’t be responsible for safety of bombers w’out x/.

b) Expansion in coastal command for U-Boat camp. 1 new O.T.U. needed for that.

c) New Bomber A.T.U. for expandg. Bomber Command.

d) Disastrous to stop beginning work where sites requisitioned and farmers turned out.

P.M. No work on new airfields for next 2 months. This doesn’t exclude special x// exceptions for wh. a special case can be made out to M/Defence.

P.M. C.O.S. say by July/Aug. 12/15 U.S. Divns. is maximum possible.

24

We are preparg. for 27 Divns. If they aren’t here till Aug. they won’t be any use – needn’t be brought until Spring ’47.

S/Air. X// Can I exclude N.I. + those constd. by U.S. labour?

P.M. 2) The 97.000 houses shd. be tackled.

3) Bring back to the towns evacuated persons for whom accommn. is available.

M/Ag. And 3.000 cottages in rural areas in ’43.

P.M. 4) Do the cottages have any relief fr. returns of evacuated persons.

5) Army. We have sent out 9 B. Divns. and there is their accommn.

W.O. No. Taken a/c of. Rather look at storage and hospital accommn.

Assume not more than 65% of Bolero needed in ‘43.

(5) Agreed. (Given these decision on airfields.

(M/P. to review remainder of field on this assumption as to Bolero.

M/P. to report in a week or 10 days – giving a Table.

As instn,. to Cttee Airfields. (1) overleaf : and also concentn. of labour on airfields under constn.

Army. Due a/c shd. be taken of large no. of Divns already sent out of U.K. Only 1 U.S. Divn. here now.

W.O. to prepare Table showg. what was to have bn. ready by ¼ and what is ready now – i.e. in troops.

This work is not wasted because it will be needed tho’ not until later than we assumed.

W.O. Can yr. redn. to 65% be accepted as firm?

P.M. Not yet. Wait for U.S. re-action. (lr. fr. F.D.R.)

W.O. But cdn’t we work on it – assumg. they won’t come or will pass on quicker.

25

M/P. 65% = 650.000 vice 1.125.000.

P.M. Priority for 65% w’in the original plan.

M/L. Shd. not evacuated offices be encouraged to return?

M/H. I shan’t be able to accommodate the workers.

Agreed M/Home Sec. to consider reversing the evacuation bias.
