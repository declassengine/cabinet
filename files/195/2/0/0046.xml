W.M.(43) 50th Meeting. 8th April, 1943.

I. Post-war Commercial Policy.

B/T Now prefer to proceed as in covering note – i.e. Cab. to take prov. decisions &amp; put these only to Dom. Govts. Urgency – may be raised at Food Conference.

Views A, B &amp; C are not separately held. I adhere to A. Export industries hoping we will be able to clear channels of trade. V. much to our interest to get multilateral agreement embracing max. no. of States - providing for system of tariffs in return for wh. we wd. limit our prefces etc., etc. Believe this to be the practical approach.

Para. 7. of memo. a) Yes = my view.

b) Only for narrowly defined purposes.

c) Yes. Some are waiting for a lead from us.

Quantitative import restns. - by 20 countries in inter-war periods.

M/Ag &amp; B/T We were able to use their quotas to get some certainty about our exports. We got somethg. in by quota when we cd. not have got anything in under free condns.

P.M. What import quotas did we impose?

B/T. V. little - Danish bacon in return for coal exports.

M/S. Also small quota of steel free of the otherwise high tariffs.

L.P. These were all part of bilateral agreements. No bearing on present issue qua multilateral arrangemt.

B/T. Shd. be no M.F. Nation Treatment for people outside the Union.

L.S.A. M.F.N. System has operated v. greater freedom of trade - agree. But needs thought in relation to U.S. who confide in M.F.N. &amp; refer to it in Art. VII. Comm. Union = denouncg. many Treaties. And those outside will be free to discrim. more heavily v. us.

144

That aspect needs more contribn. before we commit selves to Doms. Quota - powerful bargaining instrument in bilat. arrangemts. with e.g.Denmark.

Memo. on Ag. policy involves quota or levy-subsidy: neither of wh. will be consistent with this plan.

P.M. Indiv. examples quoted (e.g. Denmark) ignore bad ones over rest of field.

L.S.A. Our bargaining asset - high standard of living &amp; rich consumers’ market.

P.M. Depends on export trade &amp; foreign investment.

L.S.A. We can still use our market in bargaining. Bilateral wd. suit us better.

P.M. Stick to quota argument first. If big enough, might be a good way of getting things started.

M/P. Tactics rather than principles.

Agreement genl. that multilateral trading is ideal goal: ques is route to it.

First problem = clearing union.

Quantitative nos. of imports essentl. to start with, for limited period: everyone wd. agree. For otherwise, with lack of foreign balances, we shan’t get in the essential imports.

No good therefore makg. other concessions to U.S. Line therefore is until Clearg. Union establd. we can’t get v. far with comm. policy. Set up Clearg. Union: then say for 5 yrs. pro. we must maintain quantitative nos. of imports until we’re in posn. to pay. When U.S. find they can’t get rid of their tobacco etc., they’ll look for ways of helping us to buy.

K.W. That = View B. I agree with that. eg. Para. 5 of B/T note.

M/F. So do I.

S/Air. M/P is consistent with View A.

M/P. Humbug. = will reduce larceny by 50%, but reserve full liberty of action as regards murder. View B. = more honest.

145

P.M. Why qu. ???? imports necessary? Why can’t that be left to economic forces?

L.P. Only if you allow the exchanges to go.

Exchange will be in danger the moment war ends: so limited must reserve it for essential needs. You haven’t got gold as a balancing factor: therefore reducing bank rate won’t help you.

M/P. Also necessary, if you want to do it that way, to have creditor countries wh. understand the position of creditors. Remember we shall be a debtor, not a creditor, country.

P.M. objecting to this presentation

M/P said - We shall not have the foreign exchange or balance to get the imports.

L.P. Diff. betwn. View A &amp; View B. = View A does not contemplate use of qu. import restns after a period.

K.W. And does contemplate interference then by outside body.

Is it wise now to enter into such an arrangement? Can U.S. say what their policy is to be. What will Russia’s posn. be as rgds state-trading.

P.M. Cast iron system of state trading by all.

M.A.P. You’ll be forced to that unless you get agreement to work otherwise. Two ques. a) what you are after b) how to reach it. Are we all agreed tht. multilateral = ultimate goal.

M/P Indirect export subsidy can be done by internal subsidy e.g. cheap rlway rates.

A sham therefore to require “no export subsidies”.

M/Ag. So long as U.S.S.R. continues state trading, we can’t go back to 19th Cent. Free Trade. We must build up our trade by bilateral agreements.

P.M. Fundamentally disagreed. Our aim must be multilateral. Don’t start with small ideas of bilateral details.

Start, tactically, on broadest principles: least restns.

Dangers of economic nationalism.

146

L.S.A. doctrine = death.

S.Doms. Disabuse Hull of idea tht you can still work on self-adjusting econ. mechanism of 19th Century. U.S. won’t practise that - tho’ he likes to preach it.

Cherw. Acc. to View A. any country with bad trade balance is allowed to continue with qu. import restns. If our trade is sound, we shan’t need them. Word it “any nation with an unfavourable trade balance is free to continue qu. import reslns”. Then no real diffce. between View A &amp; B. Alter (ii)(c) at top of p. 6.

C.O. Favour club if Rules O.K. But what about low-wage producers - will they be allowed membership.

M.A.P. ? If they will comply with I.L.D. condns. of labour.

M/P. Go for multilateral - reconcile views A &amp; B. on Cherwell’s line.

H.S. Alterations to qu. restns. = to depreciate currency, wh. can be allowed under Clearing Union plan.

Diffy. of maintaining right to retain qu. restns. indefinitely is tht. others will do same. No chance of bldg. up or even maintaining our exports if world is using qu. restns.

N.B. Present Trade Agreement with U.S. bans restns.

Ch. Then get them into the club, &amp; then they can’t go on unless their trade balance is bad.

M/P. Main issue = are creditor countries going to play the creditor’s role.

H.S. If you let import restns. become a habit, temptn. to use them for protectn. of new industries.

H.S. Imperial Preference. Can be used v. awkwardly by U.S. They are spending v. much in development in S. America &amp; may post-war in Europe. If they use this argument our way (on analogy of Col. welfare developmt) it will give them a claim to preferential treatment.

C.O. But they invest for profit - we for welfare.

H.S. No. Much U.S. are giving away – not investing. And they’ll do that in Europe.

147

K.W. This wd. require Treaty. Are U.S. Congress likely to provide 2/3rds majority in favour of this kind of thing.

P.M. Sumner Wellis’ policy is to break Ottawa. We must face this. Tho’ for 40 years I have opposed Imp. Preference.

P.M. Why not ask U.S. what we cd. do with them bi-laterally? Bi-lateral conversations about a multi-lateral plan.

S/Doms. Essential to talk to Doms. before spkg. to U.S.A.

P.M. Start with U.S. – then USSR – as Cttee of Club – first: ? with series of bilateral agreements.

Proceed step by step as practical events allow or compel: but in language use the loftiest!

M/L. Remember Wallace line - expansions, world-wide, of U.S. capital development all over the world. More likely to go down with U.S. business men than the Sumner-Welles line.

A.E. Reason for opening discussions early at high level - cg. Canadian anxiety over Alaskan highway.

P.M. What is effect of U.S. having all the gold? £1200m.

Bargaining weapon for us there?

Enlarged on theory of commodity dollar.

K.W. Bancor scheme is v. like this. And correct that this is closely related to commercial policy.

P.M. U.S. will play to get their Gold Reserve into action - for power.

K.W. We are on to that. They’ve taken our plan pretty well.

P.M. Non-committal expression of provisional view.

Plan A as modified by Cherwell.

All in favour save Amery &amp; Duncan.

M/S. Because we can’t make up our minds before high-level talks with U.S.. The U.S. market wd. be most valuable to us. If they were ready to lower their tariffs to us, that wd. be fine.

K.W. U.S.A. are not in fact in position to make any bargain.

148

A.E. Hull has got his Treaties through -

C.O. He has to renew his power to

S/Doms. Shd. we not first get Doms. to send people over to talk.

P.M. No. Find out on high level what is U.S. view on A. Saying provisional only: we can’t rush w’out Doms.

S/Doms. Don’t let us approach U.S. leaving Doms. in the dark.

H.O. Delay. Better to cable outline View A. &amp; ask for comments.

P.M. ?Enough to tell Doms. we’re doing it - they can talk to U.S. themselves. We can discuss alone, but not decide.

S/Doms. Danger that these ques. may arise at Food Confce. - where interests of Doms. are closer to U.S. than to ours.

Successful talks with Dom. Experts on Currence &amp; Primary Products.

K.W. Less urgent now - because doesn’t now look as tho’ Food confce. Will lead to this.

P.M. Cab. Cttee. for purpose -

a) steps necessary to implement View A as modified.

b) procedure, programme &amp; time-table

c) relation to Clearing Union etc., &amp; Buffer Stocks.

M/P. Cherwell. M.A.P. B/T. C.O. H. Johnstone &amp; K.W. (Chairman). To report in a fortnight.

II. International Regulation of Primary Products.

Cherwell. Cd. our repivs at Food Confce. be authd to advise troublesome folk to look at this plan.

M/Ag. Producer countries will never accept this – so don’t talk to U.S. about them.

M/P/ Buffer stocks won’t work unless you control production.

A.E. Let our people be authd to play this card if need be.

Will serve to warn tiresome people off the grass.

149

S/Doms. Dom. experts consulted. If appd, wish to communicate to High Commrs.
