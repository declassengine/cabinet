W.M.(43) 96th Meeting. 9th July, 1943.

I. Anti U-Boat Warfare.

P.M. First of monthly statements.

Cab. Office to instruct Dpts. to lay off other statements or discussions.

II. Black-Outs.

P.M. Is it hindering production? If so, Air Miny. will consider what can be done.

M.A.P. Yes – where black-out means workg. by day in artificial light.

P.M. Single mtg. H.O. (Chair). M/S. M.A.P. S/S. Air + H. Johnstone –

on black out factories. M/L and Admy. to send Junior Ministers.

Report w’in a week.

III. Man Power.

P.M. L.P. has reviewed: I have taken his memo. as basis &amp; altered emphasis. All these are marginal figures - only therefore ques. of adjusting emphasis. I have altered the emphasis in favour of aircraft. Traced thro’ figures in Annex II. But I doubt if more than 175 can be absorbed before end/year.

M.A.P. wrote down his target when he assumed office - won’t meet even that programme w’out a full flow of men. Last Dec. I gave full emphasis to anti-U-Boat: now I think it shd. be transferred to M.A.P. Running now with nearly 2 crews to each aircraft - tho’ justifiable on bombers, we must remember tht. aircraft = limiting factor.

Budgeting now for deficit of 71.000. Realised deficit must be spread pro rata except for M.A.P.

M/L. Have considered M.A.P. position. With wastage, 31.000 p. month net increase wd. involve input of 80.000 p. month.

If it’s given this absolute priority – it means

a) v. few tradesmen for Services.

b) R.E.M.E. demands for techn. offrs. wd. have to be cut further.

c) F.A.A. &amp; fitters for R.N. wd. have to be cancelled.

d) certified engineers for U.S. ships - 90% of these are in aircraft. 5/600 key men. If they are to be supplied they must come out of M.A.P.

e) 9.000 RAF mechanics in M.A.P. They must stay where they are. 247

f) R.A.F. deferred service shd. go into MAP dirn before being called up. They wd. also have to be kept on in the factories.

(S/Air, save for aid-crews)

(this was accepted)

g) Heavier cut on M/Supply than those discussed: &amp; they must be in places where M.A.P. can take them.

h) Minimum intake of women into Services.

i) Further cut on C. Defence. 25.000. (L.P. Additional? There is not much more to come.

M/L. I agree tht. if an additional 25.000 were combed out you wd. reduce it to part-time basis.)

M/P. 30.000 men for 2 months to meet U.S. bldg. requirements

Result of doing this statistically by end/43 wd.

mean 31.000 p.m. in M.A.P.

32.000 “ out of M/S.

Even if MAP cd. take these M/S. cdn’t release. With more time, beyond Dec M/S. cd. yield the nos. Important therefore tht. we shd. know quickly what M.A.P. can take.

M.A.P. 20/25.000 a month. All depends on when we start.

M/P. Last sentence in para. 9. Important tht. intake for July shd. be reduced to 1/6th of remaining allocation. Otherwise v. little margin.

Cancel future option for women. “If you’re tardy you mustn’t be choosy.”

Can’t be done at 32.000 p.m. from M/Supply. Cd. do it with elbow-room either on slower intake into M.A.P. of extension of period.

M/S. Our releases have bn. greater than M.A.P. increases. You can’t in fact match intakes &amp; releases like this.

We plan to give up another 52.000 before end/Sept.

Don’t believe it humanly possible to reach 215.000 by end/year w’out creatg. such confusion as wd. cause public discontent. We will accelerate our discharge: &amp; reach 215.000 by end/April.

Unemployment is already appearing in some areas.

M/L. Yes: &amp; loss of labour inevitable on transfer fr. M/S. to M.A.P.

Don’t believe you will achieve M.A.P. expansion by 175.000 by end/year: result of this attempt will be to starve other activities of labour they cd. have had.

M/S. Firms we’ve closed all beginning to tell us tht. labour released is not being re-absorbed.

Admiralty.

248

A.V.A. Para 2(c). assumes further economies. We’ve already scraped the tin. We’ve paid off the armed cruisers to man escort vessels. We’d already decided to pay off the R-Class battleships save Ramillies, + also 4 cruisers. But demands on us for combined ops. outweigh these savings.

We’ve always spread our allocation evenly over the year. Because we haven’t taken an excessive propn on first half we are now cut below Dec. allocation.

Total lift on Overlord will be reduced by 1/3rd. - B. share in it by ½.

P.M. Comb-Ops. - requd only for short periods for special duty. Much too expensive to treat them as separate force. Once harbours have bn. seized beach landings become unnecessary. After Overlord, R.N. shd. eat up most of the l-craft fleet &amp; bud them out again

A.V.A. 9.000 of the key men for this fleet have bn. provided by R.N.

P.M. Med-victories already gt. relief to M/W.T. If we clear Med. satisfactorily there will be a further gt. relief to R.N. - much of the force there can be brght home,

1st Sea Ld. You can do this a) when G. defeated: &amp; escort vessels no longer

requd; or

b) when you know no more comb. opns

will be requd save in F/East.

Until then, no possibility of such inter-change.

The men can’t be swopped over fr. Fleet to l.craft w’out period of training: &amp; we can’t get time or interval for that training.

No dual-purpose use is possible this year:

P.M. Agreed.

A.V.A. P.M.’s allocn wd. mean paying off all cruisers!

Pound. 31.500 men requd for Fleet itself. This wd. mean leavg. unmanned

41 cruisers or 135 destroyers. 35.250 for l. craft. Loss of these has effects above on Overlord.

A.V.A. My main contentn is tht. all the remedies wh. P.M. suggd to warrant his reduction have already bn. taken into a/c before our demands were formulated.

War Office.

P.S. We’ll do our best with this allocaton. We’ve combed a lot already: and combing is hindered by 406.000 lower than Cat. A.

249

Consequences likely = scrap one Divn. now &amp; another in spring. Will get P.M.’s authy. for this.

Riflemen. !man p. section (3b) has bn. adopted vice 72.

Results of getting no tradesmen may be serious.

M.L. Civil industries now on par with munitions. No longer “less essential.”

And coal. Now down to 706.000. Can’t get them now even by direction.

War Office (resumed).

W.O. a) Only about 25.000 more after end/July. Want highest propn

of these to be A.1. men.

b) Bldg. labour shd. be settled to-day. Only quick decision =

make the best of M/P.

x/ earlier decision.

R.A.F.

S/Air. Effect of this allocn = 7.000 increase after allowing 57.000 wastage in year. men .25% p. month.

But if M.A.P. requirements met 20% more aircraft to be manned with force no larger.

This can only be met by expedients like those wh. you have suggd for R.N.

P.M. Suppose improvemt. in N. Atlantic continues. Isn’t it poss. to bring over 20.000 U.S. labourers for airfield constn.

W.O. Arranged for later in year. U.S. can’t provide their constructional troops now.

M/P. U.S. refuse my request tht. they shd. bring over constructional troops.

P.M. Don’t actually stop any of these airfields. U.S. will take it to mean we don’t think they’re worth their keep.

M/L. I can give the labour for run-ways - it’s the building of the huts etc.

F.O. Why can’t they live in tents?

S/Air. Operating in winter weather.

W.O. Repeated x/: and M/Labour agreed.

M/P. What shall we tell the Americans?

250

P.M. When will you be ready to talk? M/L and M/P shd consider &amp; rpt. by Tuesday.

C.I.G.S. In C.C.O.S. we made it clear they must send right propn of constr. Labour - &amp; someone is now trying to go back on that.

M/L. Decide not to give addl. 5.000.

Let M/P. Portal &amp; me meet &amp; see how we can do the airfields.

Cherwell. a) Better off than we planned 155.000 more in Army than we aimed at.

b) Don’t like budgeting for a deficit. No diffy. in disposing of a surplus.

P.M. Resume Tuesday. I will see Admy Monday. U.S. posn to be cleared by then (M/P.) 251
