W.M.(43) 31st Meeting 17th February 1943

The Beveridge Report. Debate.

Whiteley. Result of Debate Labour Party mtg. S/Doms. and H.O. did not convince the Party. They aren’t satisfied with Commn. proposal : fear it may become another Assistce. Bd. V. generally, Govt. response to Labour demands is only half-hearted as compared with Govt. response to Tory pressure (e.g. on coal rationing). General public expectg. more from Govt. than has bn. offered. Temper of mtg. this morning v. unsatisf.

M/L. Main point surely is delay in promotg. legn.

H.O. Agreed. The inference that legn. will be delayed.

L.P. I didn’t say so. I said we’d go on as fast as we could.

K.W. Posn. is tht. immed. after today’s Debate we will begin discussions with interests about Med. Service : Dpts. wd. prepare for ch. allowances : other agreed proposals will be advanced. Dpts. concerned will go on subject to co-ordidnn. by Jowitt.

Then, when prepns. made. Govt. wd. review the other claims and resume consideration of financial posn. That is what every Govt. does before introducing a Bill. What’s wrong with that?

P.M. Agree : save tht. I’m not sure that this large Bill shd. be carried thro’ by this Parlt.

Has the time come to form a Govt. concerned with matters other than the prosecution of the war? W’out a Genl. Election.

Many people concerned with the war. Country wd. oppose a desertion of the Coalition.

S/Doms. Didn’t come into this Govt. on basis only of dealing with War. Always understood tht. we wd. concern ourselves with prepns. for post-war problems. Moreover, the public are v. much interested in their post-war conditions.

This Govt. must either govern or get thro’ Genl. Election a Govt. that will.

We have e.g. concluded a 20 year Treaty with Russia. That commits the future : we can’t exclude other things on ground of no jurisdiction.

P.M. Peril to financial security : irresponsible commitments.

84

We must get our soldiers home and into employment.

I’m not fighting this issue on “No Mandate” basis.

Deal with this on merits of this Bill. Suppose you draft and even introduce it : you can’t bring it into force during the war.

S/Doms: Labour Party are not irresponsible about this.

P.M. Everyone wants it : but can you pay for it? You can’t pass the Bill before you know where you are.

H.O. Introdn. of Bill. L.P. authd. to say wd. go ahead with prepn. : when it was ready we wd. review the whole posn. (in light of financial situation and other claims) and wd. then tell H/Commons what our decision is.

If we said “no legn. until after the war”, the H/Commons wdn’t have it.

Political crisis : solid Labour vote in favour of the Motion tabled.

P.M. I must ascertain views of Tory Party.

K.W. Crisis has arisen because last night 3 or 4 Labour Members (administrative Cttee of Labour Party) put down Motion.

H.O. If this Govt. leaves its successor with no legislative prepn. for post-war period we shall be treacherous to the country.

M/L. We arrived at agreement on Monday. I stand by that.

Our conclusions (reached with C/Ex.) were embodied in Cttee’s Rpt.

P.R. Cttee agreed tht. after Debate we shd. proceed at once with preparations includg. prepn. of Bill. I’m not prepared to ride rough-shod over people w’out negotiations, whoever they are, whatever Labour Party say.

Ditto. with vol. hospitals. If when we reached tht. stage war was still on, we wd. be ready to go fwd. with Bill reservg. date of operation.

Subject only to review of all financial implications of other projects.

P.M. Whoever is responsible on day when G. is beaten shd. have power to decide.

85

L.P. Was my speech inconsistent with what you’ve just said.

I said tht. as soon as prepns. complete Govt. wd. review posn. and wd. come to conclns. and put their views to H/C.

Went beyond my authy. on point only : said tht. meanwhile we wd. have a planning group. Cab. supported this.

M/L. When the time comes wd. prefer a Bd. workg. under definite rule. H.O. L.P. K.W. agreed. Not a Ministry, with full discretion.

Med. Service to stay under M/H because in state of development.

This is relevant to Motion urging immed. apptmt. of M/Social Security.

A.E. That case can be argued and put.

P.M. My plan was to win the war and keep the Govt. united for purpose of putting thro’ a programme of 4/5 projects of social improvement.

However, if apprd. day can be left blank. I wdn’t oppose introdn. of Bill. Tho’ I think it wd. be unwise – occupying much Parly. time and provoking much controversy. So long as we reserve the right to decide at end of war when to bring it into operation.

L.P. Bill wdn’t be ready for at least 12 months.

If we are to negotiate with interests affected, as M/L. suggests, it is bound to take a very long time to complete the preparations.

Ch.Whip. Speaker may call the Labour amendment.

H.O. Arrangement now is for K.W. to speak today and me tomorrow. Better on the whole to leave this undisturbed.

Am prepared to defend the decisions reached on Monday.

Ch.Whip. Conservatives will be solid, but K.W. shd,. deal today with suggns. for early apptmt. of M/Social Security.

K.W. It wd. hamper the work. This can be got across to the House.

S/Doms. We can have no arrière penséé about a negative commitment, in regard to legislation.
