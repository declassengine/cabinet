W.M.(43) 45th Meeting. 25th March, 1943.

Proposed Food Conference.

P.M. General warning – risk of angering the people.

M/F. Recognise conference full of potential dangers.

a) may get controlled by faddist – platform for ideas of new nutritional heaven. They will raise hopes, but no machinery.

b) The problems of commodity control &amp; exchange clearing shd. be dealt with by a separate conf. of difft. people.

c) In all-nations conf., when it comes , B. Emp. shd. speak with one voice. If we can’t settle producer/consumer problem in our own family first …..

d) Danger of world food shortage in post-war years. Demand may outrun supply. Consumpn increasg. everywhere – internal spending power is increasg. In U.S. they are falling down on my demands because increased purchase power in U.S. is leading to increased food consumption. Also food production will decline. Withdrawal of U.S. workers fr. land. Same factor at work in Africa – shortage of ground nuts due to diversion of labour to defence works etc. This exhausts our reserves v. post-war needs. When relief needs arise, enormous drain on stocks. Wise therefore to consider what problems will be in post-relief period – when all stocks have gone &amp; risk of scramble for available food. Anything done now to avoid that scramble will be to our advantage – e.g. continue on a wider basis the work of Combined Food Boards. This is the hope of a Conference – that might emerge.

K.W. Genl. lines we shd. take suggd in telegram to Halifax.

a) Decide what issues to be put to U. Nations Conf. Para 1. of Tel. II.

b) Steering Cttee: to get them on right lines &amp; avoid uncontrolled apptmt of Sub-Cttees of Food Conf.

c) Avoid controversial topics – e.g. what scheme.

128

d) Status of delegates: not too high: so they can’t be expected to commit H.M.G.

Danger: this has bn. rushed w’out proper preparation. Essential to have an understanding in advance with U.S. Govt.

H.O. a) Illustrates need to clear own ideas re genl. economic problems.

b) We are not in a stage to allow H.M.G. to be committed.

K.W. Some U.S. politics here: they wd. rather be discussing food than e.g. currency.

L.P. Promoted by nutrition enthusiasts in U.S.

Two dangers –

a) optimum nutritional standards for whole world – ludicrous.

b) Or. delegates will be led at once into diff. economic problems for wh. we aren’t ready for discussions.

Nec. to have clear understanding with U.S. Govt. tht. b) will not be handled at present stage.

Desire therefore to stiffen up draft Telegram.

S/Doms. Need also for close accord with Dom. delegates.

Cherwell. We shall be only importing country of any size.

Open conflict of interest between us and Doms.

Support L.P. views.

K.W. Delegate ? Mabane.

Cherw. ? Ask for postponement pending b). Felt impossible.

M/Ag. U.S. selection of our delegates indicates risk of a).

B/T. Dangerous if this spilled over into commercial ques. E.g. cotton agreement now wd. be v. dangerous

Presume will last a good time. Soon we may have cleared our minds on Commercial Policy. Then wd. be gt. advantages qua Food Conf. if we cd. get Comm. Policy etc., accelerated.

129

I.S.A. India. This Conf. is being promoted by high-standard producers. Doesn’t at all suit low-standard countries like India. Those parts of Empire whose interests are difft. fr. Australia &amp; Canada shd. therefore be fairly represented.

Law. Maisky has told us USSR will say 27/4 is too soon. If they ask for postponement it will help us.

Must have Confce – want them to confine themselves to resolns on food - want to get talking with U.S. separately on Clearing Union &amp; Commodity Control - possible lever to secure techn. discussions on these earlier is reluctance of U.S. to have these plans published.

K.W., L.P., Law &amp; Cherwell to settle revised draft of telegram.

Agreed.
