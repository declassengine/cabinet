Church Bells.

L.P. Referred to his memo. The “regulated Areas” were established for offensive purposes: don’t coincide with those where risk of invasion is most likely.

x/ If other 2 sets of precautions (immobilisation &amp; road-signs) apply to certain area, the Church Bells relaxation shd. also apply to that area.

S/Doms. Why not let them ring everywhere, even in regulated Areas.

P.M. V. complicated as L.P. proposes.
