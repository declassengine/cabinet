W.M.(43) 47th Meeting. 1st April, 1943.

I. Naval Construction.

K.W. Carriers. Won’t be completed (new ones) until ’47.

P.M. But dropping battleships, save Vanguard: and reducing cruisers. And at end of war we must have modern weapons.

Balance is right save for larger destroyers.

C.N.S. Only new carriers can carry larger aircraft wh. can fight land-based aircraft. Destroyers: wd. like all to be Battle class. Must have 4.5 gun going to 80 degrees.

Can’t get all that into inter-mediate type, wh. are therefore only Fleet destroyers - &amp; can’t operate alone for trade protection.

P.M. Strong objn is unarmoured vessels carrying 250 men. The hunter becomes the hunted if made too large: this is danger of improving destroyers beyond point at wh. it passes out of hunting class. Cost as much as cruisers did in last war.

K.W. And frigates &amp; corvettes cd. be built much quicker.

A.V.A. So many destroyers lost by air attack: &amp; if you wan’t to give crews confidence in their proper work you must give them protection v. the air.

P.M. Wd., if 1st Lord, have contested this development: need for strength in intervening period: wd. have concentrated rather on frigates &amp; corvettes. These are not really destroyers, they are cruiserkins.

A.V.A. Have argued with Sea Lords: only support for this view is fr. Tovey &amp; even he weakens on the AA argument.

P.M. Doubt if we will still be fighting in West in mid ’45 when these ready.

C.N.S. But these are the vessels we shall want v. Japan. We are forced up to this tonnage.

P.M. Balance wrong: 20 of these only – put balance into frigates etc..

134

C.N.S. Need = 190. In service 92. v. heavy losses. If these continue, we shall still be 48 short by time these are built.

P.M. Not convinced. Aircraft carriers will be there to give this protn v. air attack with Fleets. Wd. rely on that &amp; give more to convoy protn vessels.

C.N.S. The carriers will need destroyer fringe. Everything is faster: destroyers must have the speed, too.

Switch of prodn fr. destroyers to frigates v. difficult.

M.P. Wd. such a switch affect posn until beginning of ’45?

A.V.A. Yes: laying down to completion of frigates = 8 months

P.M. x/ Cd. we have report on what additional frigates &amp; corvettes cd. be obtained if the heavy destroyers reduced to 20?

A.V.A. Break up continuity of production. Wd. try to find a suitable yard, where e.g. you cd. put 2 corvettes vice 1 destroyer.

C.N.S As we stand, we’ll be better off in trade protn. fleet than in fighting fleet. Wrong to throw this balance still further over.

A.V.A. U.S. Battle Fleet will be v. large by ’45.

Agreed {order 20 destroyers (heavy) at once. } Examine also intermediate } destroyers

hold over the b pending x/.

A.V.A. Great strain in bldg. landing craft. 61.000 men for that by 12 mos’ time, quite separate from Fleet.

II. Gift of Destroyers to Canada.

P.M. Shd. I put out somethg. about Canada’s effort on Dom. Day? Army guarding U.K., built up Navy, Air Training Scheme, 2 bill. loan, munitions output.

H.O. Can’t we also agree now to meet the further request for 2 more.

Agreed: A.V.A. to consider himself free when request is made.

III. Ceylon Constitution.

C.O. a) gt. importance of Ceylon to war interests of U. Nations.

135

b) the constitution is, oddly, working: and the Ministers have given v. loyal tho’not always efficient support to war effort.

Embarrassingly well – think they’ve done much better than India: yet India has had large constitutional promise.

The more guarded statement did not satisfy Ceylon. Govr. &amp; C-in- C. both satisfied tht. unless more is said, Ceylon’s war effort will be prejudiced.

P.M. No safeguards for B. commercial interests.

C.O. But strong bargaining power, as we take most of her exports. This doesn’t go as far as C. Ministers want. Can’t guarantee this will satisfy them.

K.W. Catto’s views.

C.O. But he isn’t on the spot, as Govr. &amp; C-in-C are.

L.P.S. Diff. not to do what C.O. proposes.

On last occasion Govr. &amp; C-in-C misjudged the situation. But make it clear tht. we won’t be pushed any further. And don’t encourage them “meanwhile” to formulate proposals.

C.O. Reason for that = make them face up to minority problem.

P.M. Do it only in return for Agreement on B. &amp; Indian commerce.

L.S.A. Aren’t both these last matters for the Commission or Conference.

S/Doms. On separation of Burma, we had a commercial agreement.

W.O. But India &amp; Burma were one as India &amp; Ceylon are not.

P.M. C-in-C. won’t worry of course because he knows he can take total powers whenever he likes.

Dislike it, but wd. agree if it cd. be accompanied by agreement for protecton of Indian or B. commercial interests.

Also on minorities, will it not be an evil precedent for India.

Refer back for assurances on

{ a) protection of minorities { b) commercial agreement.

136

Agreed { fill in these &amp; other details (drafting requirements of other Dpts)

{and examine it again.

L.P. to consider with L.S.A., L.P.S., K.W. and B/Trade.
