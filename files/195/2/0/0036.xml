W.M.(43) 39th Meeting 11th March, l943

I. Shipments to the Middle East.

M/W.T. Egypt posn more serious because of what they’re doing for Turkey.

Agreed E. wd. release 50,000+ for Turkey: but only on replacement. Latter is necessary because of releases to eg Persia &amp; Malta. Replacement of that 50.000+ wd. meet the case qua cereals.

Nitrates also necessary if later need of cereals is not to be greater. They won’t help us to supply other countries in M/East unless they have some assurance about nitrates for their next season’s crops. A good bargain fr. our pt. of view. Postponement wd. only mean we’d have to do it in a last-minute hurry wh. wd. involve more waste of shipping.

Recommn in memo. is contingent on addl. ships fr. U.S. for the military operation.

In those 14 ships we cd. prob. accommodate (additionally) both cereals &amp; nitrates.

Wd. like to have some forward plan – even if it didn’t extend beyond 4 months. This wd. meet M/State demand unless Turkey insisted on her higher demand.

M/P. Before going about 50.000+ for Turkey, scrutinize her demands since l939.

W.O. L. asks for first charge in any circs. – not contingent on getting the 14 U.S. ships.

Agree tht. these cargoes cd. be squeezed into those 14 ships.

But if those ships aren’t forthcoming, &amp; this first charge is accepted, then the mil. opn will have to be postponed. i.e. that opn. can only go on if U.S. provide 14 ships.

S/Doms. Remember tht. M/State programmes have bn. affected by mil. needs of Malta and N. Africa.

112

W.O. We have already combed mil. demands to minimum, at P.M.’s request.

M/W.T. x/ You cd. meet that contingency to some extent by paring maintenance needs in certain areas.

W.O. If you don’t get 14 ships, 25% cut in mil. supplies to M/E. in April.

M/W.T. But if the opn is postponed much more shipping will be available.

C.O. Rice fr. Egypt to Ceylon is going v. slow: promise of nitrates is necessary to get the cereals out of Egypt.

M/W.T. We know tht. Egyptian demands for nitrates is minimum.

Is the Turkish demand really to be met in full? eg. P.M.’s note.

W.O. Only arguable case as at x/ is 10.000t. of food to Malta.

H.O. Isn’t Turkey a “good will” consignment under terms of P.M.’s note.

W.O. Our limit of 40 ships a month wd. have to rise to 75 after March if we are to get fulfilment of all plans agreed at Casablanca.

Another point – if we get only 10 of the 14 ships, this extra civil commitment if given 1st priority wd. make if diff. or imposs. for us to keep our dates.

M/W.T. If we get 14, we can carry this civil extra w’out much mil. diffy.

If we don’t get 14, the opn can’t take place anyway.

W.O. But excludg. all civil supplies, you might just do it on 8 ships.

M/W.T. But C.O.S. have said 14 is minimum they can accept.

M/P. We can’t decide until we know about the 14 ships. Can’t M/State hold the position meanwhile?

M/W.T. It will be 10 days before U.S. decide.

L.P. L. wants to give firm promise to M/State.

We have asked for 14 ships in conn. mil. opn. On that decn. opn. or not turns.

If opn, then civil obligns. can be met thro’ those ships.

113

If no opn. we can carry out his obligns. by use of other ships set free.

W.O. My objn. to yr. blanket priority is that it excludes possibility of doing the mil. opn. with something a little less than 14 ships.

L.P. Remember that success of this mil. opn. will give a big shipping dividend.

H.S. You cd. give a firm promise now &amp; meet it in either of 2 ways.

a) thro’ the 14 ships.

b) expense of U.K. programme.

If your opn. is really urgent, then b) is not out of the question.

M/L Inter-departmental discns needed to present us with clear statement of implications.

R.A. Early decision v. necessary fr. pt/view M/east.

Their imports only 10% of pre-war.

C.O. W.O. argument is based on assumption that normal civil supplies to this area cd. be discontinued. They cdn’t.

_______________________________________________

Discussion resumed at 6.p.m.

M/W.T. Agreed tht. no diffy. if we have the 14 ships.

If we get less than 14: civil cargo (some of wh. is food for military &amp; rest essential minimum civil needs) represents (of ships loaded with military much = space not otherwise used) 3 ships = what cdn’t be stowed at no military cost.

If therefore only 11 &amp; mil. made no contribn……..

S/Doms Cd. mil. cargo be stowed in 11 ships?

M/W.T. 11 ships wd. meet 90% of their needs.

114

W.O. If we get 11, can we stow all our mil. cargoes with no civil: answer = yes. If you have to take all civil, 10% loss of mil. needs.

S/Doms. Must you not have a part of 14 ships?

W.O. No.

W.O. With 11 ships I cd. carry 90% of mil. and all civil cargo.

M/W.T. I can’t answer S/Doms. qun. because I don’t know nature of mil. cargo.

W.O. Remember there are 19 B. ships apart fr. the 14 U.S. ships.

M/L. That gives us more elbow-room to take risks.

M/W.T. Remember I can’t risk dropping any large amount of the v. restricted civil cargoes.

M/L. Failure to send food &amp; nitrates to M/East may well prejudice the military posn just as much as loss of 10% of military cargoes.

W.O. We cd. get all, mil. &amp; civil, in 14 ships. If we get less than 14, there is a balancing point at wh. you either prejudice mil. opn. or wd. have to reverse the first priority for L. I put that balancing point at 11 ships.

L.P. If true tht 14 to 11 wd. still enable mil. opn. to go on, the issue = cargo of 3 ships. Some allowance must be made for stowing conditions. Always space for deadweight cargo.

M/W.T. Allowance has bn. made already for this.

3 ships = what civil cargoes can’t be stowed in free space of 11 mil. ships.

Without that allowance wd. = 5 ships.

L.P. Margin = 3 ships at worst. If things go badly, at worst we have to find 3 ships to make it good. We cd. take that risk, in view of our total shipping.

W.O. Record tht. if we get less than 14 the risk is tht. you mayn’t be able to ship enough mil. stores to avoid jeopardising opn. i.e. if we have to take the full bump on loss of 3 ships.

Agreed: Give M/State the guarantee &amp; shoulder the responsibility for meeting it w’out endangering the mil. opn.
