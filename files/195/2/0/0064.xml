W.M.(43) 76th Meeting. 24th May, 1943.

(3. p.m.)

Operation Lifebelt.

S/Doms. Don’t understand the hurry.

A.E. Told before Campbell rtd. to Lisbon this wdn’t arise.

Understood before R. wanted to do it: now appears that he doesn’t &amp; will need persuasion.

M.A.P. P.M. won’t in the event call it off. “If …if…and…if” in this sentence.

V.C.I.G.S. This reply sent before C.O.S. had considered our telegram.

A.E. In eyes of P. and the world, if we invoke the Alliance &amp; S. says “no”, we shd. be in much stronger posn to use force. This P.M. plan gives us worst of all worlds.

H.O. Agree on basis a) no interf. with Husky

b) diplomatic approach 48 hrs. before

c) no withdrawal if S. says “no”.

S/Doms. If you decide on this you must go thro’ with it. No last-minute withdrawal

V.C.N.S. supported this qua escorts. Generally agreed.

A.V.A. No guidance re. time of operation.

V.C.I.G.S. 20/7 is earliest date of assumption of v. full U.S. help.

M/L. Totally against this project – not a “hard decision” but a wrong one. Wd. undo much of our progress twds world esteem.

S/Air. When you wd. make the diplomatic approach?

A.E. A week before ready to do it by force.

H.O. Oldest ally hasn’t played the game.

S/Doms. But we’ve not bn. able to defend them.

M.A.P. Justifiable only if absolutely vital = &amp; not shown to be such.

L.P. N.B. He now has to persuade F.D.R. Apparently only P.M. is keen on it.

204

V.C.N.S. Expld advantages of Azores – extend air cover so as to avoid need to go north across Atlantic thro’ worst weather: wd. be specially valuable in autumn/winter.

A.E. [In reply to ques] we are advised tht. S. wd be more ready to yield to diplomatic approach rather than by pistol to head at short notice.

Only disadvantage in dipl. approach = P. on toes via heels. Repeated several times.

V.C.I.G.S. Interval of 7 days: v. little mil. diffce.

If approach made now &amp; fails, not much diffce. again because they will think all blown over before blow falls.

M/P. Make the d. approach when ready to go by force. Then P. have a better answer to Germans.

S/Doms. Say: consider d. approach has some chance of success. If it fails, we can then take action on much better grounds.

A.E. Produced a draft telegram.

V.C.I.G.S. Diff. betwn. length of warning under P.M.’s plan or under A.E.’s plan is not considerable. Any warning is mil. undesirable: but if you give any it makes no v. great diff. whether its 1 day or 7.

M.A.P. Why not make d. approach &amp; don’t mount expedn until he’s refused.

A.E. That wd. be more diff. militarily?

V.C.I.G.S. He might go to sleep – thinkg. nothg. more wd. happen.

He might make more effective propns. Even tell the Germans: but cd. they do anything.

That course wd. involve increased mil. risk.

M.A.P. If expedn gas already sailed before d. approach made, then feeling will be bad because thought to be eye-wash.

V.C.N.S. A week’s notice wd. enable G. to draw their U-Boats down to attack our expedn if S. leaked to the Germans.

M.A.P. x/ Much more likely tht. S. will do this on basis of Alliance than on a threat.

Wd. re-act v. badly to a threat – that sort of man.

This view was shared by S/Doms, M/L.

Why not include x/ in telegram? There, but better brought together.

M/P. Expedn to be laid on.

205

Dipl. approach, w’out threat, when ready to sail } Add to telegram:

Then threat. } summary of

Then use force. } proposed action.

C.O. There wd. in any case be 4 months’ delay.

M/L. In 1940 we had far stronger reasons for takg. drastic action re. Irish ports.

Not prepd to agree to tear up Treaty.

S/Air. An attraction to S. wd. be that if he yielded to d. approach it wd. not involve U.S. occupation. – by implication, if we use force it wd. by Anglo-American.

Genl. feeling: a) make dipl. approach – soon.

b) get on quietly with plans.

L.P. Don’t let us a have dipl. approach wh. is a mere cloak to force.

Have expedn laid on: but don’t have it said that we were going in anyhow &amp; only used d. approach as whitewash.

If you’ve tried w’out success, you’ve demonstrated tht. Treaty is valueless &amp; you’re the more entitled to take other measures.

Agreed: F.O. to prepare draft telegram.
