W.M.(43) 88th Meeting. 24th June, 1943.

Civil Aviation.

W.A.S. Obvious tht. U.S. &amp; Doms, will retain their internal services. Thus, internal services for us must mean inter-Empire, not intra U.K. i.e. we must get as near to that as possible. Hence search for formula. Room for bi-lateral agreements w’in an international frame.

L.S.A. Present convention enables us to reserve inter-Emp. traffic entirely. We think however that conception shd. be generalised. Analogy of coastwise traffic wh. many countries reserve tho’ “Freedom of the seas” accepted. French, U.S. &amp; others will insist on this qua air.

We must reserve for Col. Empire. e.g. between W. Indies.

Inter-Dom.

Criticism of W.A.S. Doesn’t look well to give free landing w’out free picking up. Believe U.S. &amp; we wd. be suited by wider policy.

E.g. right of any 2 countries to pool by bi-lateral agreement so as to share their reserved internal traffic. U.S. cd. conclude such agreements with Canada &amp; Mexico. Small Europ. Countries wd. benefit too. Not purely fr. advantage to B. Empire.

S/Doms. This is only an elaboration of our scheme &amp; not inconsistent with it.

L.S.A. More generous - Cttee disagreed.

Wd. include v of P.M.’s Memo. omitting words in brackets.

K.W. Confine this discussion to procedure.

S/Doms. We tried to get prior agreement with Doms. Canada disliked &amp; suggd mtg. in Ottawa with U.S. We didn’t want to leave out Russia. Now Canada object to our mtg. among ourselves in advance. We must resist them on that. This memo. to be basis for discussion with Doms. &amp; India + U.S. &amp; Russia.

K.W. May get agreement on some issues before we go to Ottawa.

H.O. Pity to abandon internationalisation. Prefer to let U.S. wreck it.

S/D. But Doms. turned it down.

K.W. We’ve tried it for 12 months: &amp; Doms. won’t support it. We’ve lost time over it.

H.O. Worried about U.S. resources in prodn &amp; oil. 225

x/ Hope we’ll at least try for internationalisation in Regions -

e.g. W. Europe &amp; Far East.

S/D. We contemplate x/: and want fullest practicable international agreement.

A.E. Internatn: what was put to Doms. was full internatn. Wd. not wish to exclude internatn in Europe. How long otherwise shall we be able to deny civil aviation to Germany? Shd. be an objective to get the main lines in Europe internationalised.

P.M. Strictest repression of all aviation in vanquished countries - suspn. + penalties.

Agree must then be able to say we’ll carry for you. e.g. Wagon-Lits:

and we might get hold of it.

M.A.P. Para 2(viii) wd. the ground facilities in ex-enemy countries be provided internationally? Yes.

S.D. You will never get U.S. agreement to that. Nor will you control subsidies

in fact tho’ you may in theory. M.A.P. &amp; others agreed

P.M. Not amalgams of all countries: each country wd. contribute &amp; internat. orgn wd. control (Council of Europe).

A.E. The internatl services might (or must) take on the internal services of Germany - &amp; prob. all European countries save France. Spain wd. be incapable of running their own.

P.M. Side-deal with U.S. - we taking prominent part in Europe against conceding to them American Continent incldg. Canada.

A.E. Incorporate in our instructions Balfour on Freedom &amp; Rates??

&amp; Frequencies. }

Operators Conference to deal with rates, subject to } Agreed.

Appeal to internat. Council. }

L.S.A. Poles French etc., will insist on havg. their own aircraft. - Cab. disagreed: they can be held down, for lack of money petrol etc.

Cherw. Put some Convention into Peace Treaty - authy. of World Council.

Ques is: to what extent do we wish to press for freedom of air. I wd. include right to pick up as well as set down.

Wd. also have competn to allow B. planes to fly fr. Warsaw to Berlin.

M/W.T. This will work only if you control frequencies.

Cherw. Let only un-subsidised lines compete?

226

H.O. You can fix rates &amp; rely on that. Subsidy then = diff. betwn. that rate and the operating costs.

L.P. No system that depends on audit wd. work. Generally

agreed [ Cherwell dissenting

S/D We shall have to subsidise for Doms.: Colonies. O.S. agreed.

P.M. Proper control of rates &amp; frequencies wd. cover most of what we want.

O.S. Also freedom to pick up not de jure but by bi-lateral agreement. This makes it possible to prevent e.g. French fr. going too far, by excessive subsidies.

M.A.P. Control over frequencies &amp; rates by internatl organisn will be the Key. The scale of operation (wh. P.M. fears) will be controlled by by frequencies - not only on one service but generally. A part. Country might be allowed no operation on part. Routes.

L.S.A. Only limitn on subsidies in last analysis = Budgetary considns.

M/W.T. The subsidies cdn’t be applied twds. rdn of rates.

P.M. Wd. like to see how frequencies are defined. Add “quotas.”

W.A.S. Route fr. Ldn. to Sydney. Can U.S. come in &amp; compete there on equal terms?

P.M. Why not? Ships can, with tourist traffic.

M/W.T. By bi-lateral agreement on reciprocal basis – not as of right.

Casey. Must have prior Dom. talks, at least w’out Canada. eg Pacific position &amp; shipping history U.S. denying tht. Aust - N. Zealand is not internal.

S/D. Canadians suggest talks on official level. Think this must be insisted. Agree Russia shd. be invited.

H.J. British ascendancy in Europe to be traded v. concession to U.S. in Latin America.

Advise caution on this suggn by P.M. Tenure wd. be shaky.

P.M. One Minister shd. now take charge of marshalling &amp; presenting the

case. 227

Suggest L.P.s with Cab. Cttee. of not more than 4/5 mtg. when required. {? M/W.T., Air Miny, Cherwell, M.A.P., O.S.

S/D. Pressure in H/C. V. urgent to have it focussed &amp; get on.

K.W. Cd. we agree a) Annex C. as notified in discn shd go at once to Doms.

b) Mtg. with Doms. in advance of Ottawa.

c) Russia to be invited to the wider conference with

U.S.A.

P.M. Agree: b) on basis tht. those who want to talk will meet: &amp; Canada needn’t come if they don’t want to. Hold it elsewhere if Canada don’t want it there.

M/L. Proper staff requd. Agreed: L.P.S to make proposals.

S/D. Must tell Canada first, for they will have to summon the Conference.

P.M. When we know where we stand, I want to find out direct what President thinks about it all. Broad underlying understanding with U.S. is essential. Simple main outlines to go to President.

M/L. What about the functional organisation to operate. Will L.P.S. do that?

Makes all the diffce if this can be visualised at same time as discns go on about conventions etc.

P.M. We wd. build on B.O.A.C.

M/L. This wdn’t be enough, alone.

L.P. Some control in central Govt. over B.O.A.C. We must be ready with that. There are bits in M.A.P., Air Miny, M/W.T. Nothg. pulled together. Our State function shd. be developed concurrently.

P.M. Agree – L.P.S. to consider what Dpt. shd. handle this, functions, staff, Relations with B.O.A.C., wtr. a new Minister or M/W.T.
