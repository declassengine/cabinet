W.M.(43) 28th Meeting 12th February 1943

The Beveridge Report.

Industrial Assurances - wholly to be absorbed by State?

D/P.M. Why do Cttee reject Bev. proposal?

L.P. Because it’s not a part of this scheme. We don’t reject it on merits : we say merely it’s not nec. to this scheme and we need not therefore tackle it now.

D/P.M. Shd. be made clear tht. Govt. are not pronouncg. v. this recommn. on merits.

M/Social Security.

S/Air. Wd. M/Pensions come in?

L.P. Not war pensions.

Financial Position.

K.W. Attach gt. importance to paras. 3-6 of Rpt.

Two over-riding claims a) internl. security b) maintenance of employment.

Para. 4 : other claims. Can’t now establish priorities here or enter into commitments.

Para 5: I agree, however, tht. political situation makes it essentl. to say something.

Interested parties are keen tht. Govt. shd. make some statement – not only Parly. Parties but outside interests.

State where we stand on as many aspects as possible.

Children’s Allowances : Cttee recommend no income limit. may be said in Debate that in view of fin. posn this shd. be limited to those in need. Exclusions of higher income groups wdn’t bring v. gt. fin. relief. Will certainly be awkward ques. income tax. No hope to be extended of speedy introduction because of long time nec. to work out details – this applies to the scheme as a whole.

The legn. requd. shd. be brght. fwd. all at once – not piecemeal.

76

Comprehensive Health Service. Shd. be available to all, if they want to use it.

And all will be required to contribute. But no interference with private practice or vol. hospitals.

H.O. May well be cheaper to introduce a comprehensive scheme than have to give way to pressure on individual items.

Spirit of announcement. Inexpediency of grudging assent. If we are going to pay to Bill, we might as well get the credit for it.

Paras. 3-4. I thought our view was – first intern. security : second security at home wh. includes social insurance. Emphasis needs some revision.

Contributions. Conseqn. of not committg. ourselves to benefit rates in tht. we don’t refer to rate of contribn. Say no ques ….. read out ….

K.W. We can’t be committed on pensions. Agreed.

H.O. We must have right to look at the rates again. But cdn’t we say that broadly speakg. we expect to settle on somethg. of the same order of magnitude.

L.P. A formula on these lines to be settled and used by Govt. spokesman.

H.J. The assignment of the elements (3 contributors) in the contribn. is not immutable.

L.P. Agreed – this has not bn. discussed : B’s proposal not finally accepted.

S/Air. Spirit of announcement – must endorse not only principles but early action on these principles. Safest thing is to give H/C. a firm lead.

M/Inf. Necessary to show real enthusiasm for this Rpt.

M/P. Give impression tht. unemployment can be avoided. Use phrase “maintenance of high level of employment” in lieu of other references to trade. Put it all in terms of employment.

B/Ed. Education Bill will be ready in 2 months. Necessary therefore to indicate in Debate tht. education is not forgotten.

Cherwell. We must emphasise all the other claims. We prob. shan’t be able to do all.

77

Indicate to H/C. tht. if they plump for B. they will have to do w’out some of the other projects. All depends on full employment. It will be necessary for people to work willingly.

Afraid of going into details – eg. cutting children’s allowances. Lose all the political merit thereby : better to be vague.

O-a- pensions : say merely we can’t tie hands of future Govts.

K.W. I believe it is necessary to make detailed statements. Children’s allowcs. wrong to indicate acceptce. in principle if in fact we mean to give only 5/=

Not v. much in favour of cash allowances. Fear benefit will not go to children.

M/L. Not enthusiastic for cash allowances. – do nothg. in cash wh. will impede development of allowances in kind.

Genl. agreement with view tht. cash allowces. shd. be kept down to 5/= and leave room to expand the services.

W.A.J. Feeling that B. is “old man’s document”. Many people are against the o.a. pensions proposals and more in favour of what is given to the young.

Cherwell. Withdrew his point – on understandg. that point of presentation is fully considered.

University.

L.P. The point will be taken tht. it is unnecessary to cover those not in need.

What do Cabinet propose to say against that point of view?

S/Doms. Say impossible to define classes wh. are in no risk of ever needing social security. Adminve. difficulties.

The Subsistence Level.

H.O. Put the argument in favour of principle + factual argument as to what the figure for subsistence is.

K.W. Our Cttee. H.O. was alone in this view ¨and we therefore avoided the point in the Report (para. 25 of Rpt).

H.O. What wd. you say if ques. raised in H/C?

78

K.W. “No need to take a decision on pt. of principle ¨little reason to doubt that the rates will be broadly similar to those in B. Rpt.”

Old Age Pensions.

W.A.J. Read Rowntree’s views.

K.W. We must avoid increasing amounts for people who don’t need them.

L.P. Trouble is violent conflict between sound econ. policy and sentiment.

Can we do more than call attention to the diffies.?

M/L. Put his point about pensions due fr. employers. Trustees etc.

Approved Societies.

L.P. Are we going to take him in Rpt. Or say merely v. serious thing and we’ll wait and see views expd. in H/C. The Rpt. is the honest line. Do Cab. want to hedge.

M/N. Rpt. – Because A. Socies. won’t talk business about agency work unless it is clear tht. main issue is decided.

L.P. “Operations of Sec. must come to and end : but disposal of accumulated funds will need to be tackled as transitional provisions”.
