W.M.(43) 32nd Meeting 18th February 1943

I. Priorities for Research and Development.

S/Air. I thought date was a little optimistic : but P.M. has since pronounced in favour : don’t press that point.

W.P.54 accepted.

W.O. On W.P.66 : additional central point or body unnecessary.

M/P. Suggd. tht. Directors of S.R. in Dpts. shd. make this review : and results shd. be reviewed centrally.

W.O. It is for Service and Supply Dpts. to review : and v. few overlaps with other interests : no need for central review.

M/P. a) Dpts. will have to make the review. b) Results will have to be embodied in a document. c) All that is required is tht. this document shd. go to a central body, who will prune the overlaps.

L.P. No use saying this can be done Departmentally w’out risk of waste of skilled personnel, now this is in short supply.

This review will only affect the marginal case.

Many Dpts. using specialised physicists. eg : must involve some central review.

A.V.A. Had hoped tht. this wd. not be a one-way traffic : tht. this body wd. also be able to help me.

L.P. Acute shortage of radio-technicians.

Nuclear physicists : chemists : v. few in number : essential that they shd. be properly used.

S/Air. Agree with proposal and the survey and tht. C. shd. undertake it.

Diffy. however tht. reports go only to L.P. and M/P. Think Service and Supply Ministers shd. be consulted at that stage. L.P. and M.P. agreed.

M/L. On scientific personnel I have dealt with Hankey and L.P.

Wd. agree to this if L.P. substituted for Ld. Cherwell : because of undesirability of creating fresh organisation.

87

S/Doms. Leave it Lord President ques. responsible for scientific research generally.

W.O. No interference with Service Ministers views of their own priorities, except on ground of scarcity in skilled personnel, apparatus or materials.

L.P. No authority to decide. Recommns. to Minister concerned : tho’ I wd. reserve my right to report to War Cab. if they disagreed with me.

Agreed : L.P. via Cherwell.

II. Interchange of Technical Information with U.S.S.R.

M/P. a) Suggest that Tizard shd. not be bound to insist on quid pro quo.

T. wouldn’t go on any other terms.

Views of C.O.S. On original draft implicn. he was to be debarred fr. bargaining.

b) Shd. Mission go at all?

S/Doms. Proposal is tht. T. shd. be free to bargain or not, at his discretion.

W.O. Agree to that as a start : but if he gets nothing that way he shd. not proceed to give away all our secrets if you see you are not getting or likely to get anything in return.

M.A.P. Say to USSR in advance “if we send T. it will be to receive as well as give”.

x/ T. won’t have to stake out a bargaining position : that will have bn. done by Ambassador. Make this clear when askg. facilities for him.

C.I.G.S. T. shd. be made aware of past history.

A.E. Promised to consider x/.

Agreed.

III,. Airfield Construction.

M/P. 106 under constn. all but 24 by civilians: of the 82, 57 are for bombers.

Satisfd. tht. these are all necessary. If that were all, we might get by.

But if remaing,. 8 are authorised by M/D. we can’t get by.

88

M/L. 365.600 by end Mar. for Govt. programme as a whole.

343.000 available. 22.600 deficiency.

If I draw on other sources, can manage : but after Mar. we must proceed with planned withdrawal + 22.600.

If I can’t withdraw then, R.A.F. intake will have to be reduced pro tauts.

A.V.A. Even w’out the 8, you’ll have to cut other programmes.

M/P. No : see para. 4.

A.V.A. Our requiremts. are not in fact being met now.

W.O. If Casablanca figures of U.S. troops are realised, 80.000 (personnel) addl. 20.000 (storage) labour wd. be required. I am not prepd. to ask for these addl. nos. Propose to squeeze up for personnel accommn.

M/P. All Dpts. working to programme (except W.O. who are ahead of numbers).

Agreed : project for addl. 8 to go to M/Defence.

M/P. To consider position after 31 March.

IV. Cereals for Indian Ocean Area.

L. Demands Feb/June aggregating over 1m. tons.

India Price position or sight of imports has resulted in easier situation.

Prospects of harvest seem brighter.

Cd. S/S. India release some of tonnage already arranged

Mauritius etc. Demands met. Don’t want to invite continuing demands.

S.Africa. Claims not pressed. Doubt if they really need it : they declined a neutral ship at high freight!

N. Rhodesia. Propose to divert a ship to Kenya.

S. Rhodesia.

S/Doms. Don’t decide againt w’out reference to Shipping Committee. Agreed.

89

Kenya. Trying to get butter beans and tapioca from Madagascar. We cd. easily ship it, if M/F. cd. supply it.

Supplies for further months will have to be sustained.

Persia. Russians took some on basis of replacement. U.S. to replace ⅔ but in Russian aid ships : and Russia won’t agree to that. No chance of gettg. supplies there otherwise because of shipping and also port facilities.

Harrisson wants decision : shd. we use this space for R. or

P. needs.

W.O. At a time when we are moving forces away fr. Persia : v. important fr. our pt. of view that this shd. go to Persians.

Genl. feeling in favour of urging Americans to ship in acc. with bargains.

Agreed – subject to considn. by F.O.

Ceylon. Solved by shipping at expense of U.K. imports.

Hope this won’t continue. Supplies of rice either fr. Egypt or India. shd. come in.

S/India. Prospects of new wheat crop are good.

Ready to disregard demand for 400.000 t. after April.

Ceylon (cont). With good prospects for Indian rice crop and something fr. Egypt shd. be easier.

Turkey. Demand 150.000 t. Decided 50.000 t. fr. Egypt. – from U.K.C.C. reserves and they are askg. for replacement : wh. I am disregarding for the present. I hope tht. will suffice. More than this wd. have to be specially shipped.

Turkish ships are lifting the 50.000 t.

F.O. We shd. decide, if so, how to put this to Turkey.

3.500 + fr. U.K. Only 163 t. shipped in Jan.

Drastic cuts in their ordinary imports, while we are promised large increase in munitions.

L. P.M. urging me to resist some part of these demands.

90

3 ships in Australia bound for U.K. Cd. go to Indian Ocean if need were proved to be acute. But general position easing so much that I shd. prefer not to starve the U.K.

M/P. 150.000 t. cereals fr. Turkey in the standard “bid”. Believe reduction in other imports is more serious.

M/F. Can’t afford further cuts in our imports. Danger level coming in March rice June.

W.O. Are not India, Kenya and Ceylon really urgent?

C.O. In Kenya people are dying already. V. difft. fr. Ceylon.

L. Cdn’t S/S. India get some arranged ships for India released for Kenya.

That wd. solve my immed. problems.

S/India. Altho’ some extracted fr. hoarders, India is still short of minimum requirements.

Cdn’t commit myself. Will ask Viceroy : in view of Kenya’s extremity.

L. Also help fr. India and Egypt for rice for Ceylon.

M/F. Got 76.000 t. may get 200.000 t. of rice fr. Egypt.

C.O. Agreed that this wd. put Ceylon in posn. of security for some months.

* Turkey. Stand on 50.000 tons pending considn. by A.S.E.

* 3 ships fr. Australia to load for U.K.
