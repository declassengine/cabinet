W.M.(43) 74th Meeting. 21st May, 1943.

I. Operation Lifebelt.

V.C.I.G.S. Para. 4. C.O.S. Washington. May mean either :

a) genl. plan, not knowg. what’s involved.

b) some U.S. help, of wh. we don’t know, may have bn. offered.

We thght we cdn’t do it earlier than mid/Aug. because of lack of ships &amp; l. craft.

We shall have plans to-morrow wh. we will wire to Washington.

V. difficult. a) Effect. Attack w’out warning on oldest ally - whom we’ve recently bn. helping with arms - who have Treaty with Spain: it wd. strengthen hands of those in Spain who favour Germans.

b) U.S. commn 90% Portug. Strongly pro-British. If we did it alone, opposn wd. not be strong. U.S. v. unpopular, however - inter alia because suspicion tht. U.S. covet the Azores. If this is largely U.S. operation, diffies much greater. More important therefore tht. this shd. appear B. than it was tht. Torch shd. be U.S.

c) I wd. prefer v. much to try the diplomatic approach. We think there’s quite a chance we’ll persuade: if we fail, we’ll be in a better posn to take by force.

S.Doms. Affect on other P. possessions. We can’t do it w’out consulting

Smuts – for whom it wd. be dangerous precedent.

M/P. Wolfram stocks in G., &amp; prodn small. Requirements about 6.000t. Only sources are Spain &amp; P. Recent agreement with Salazar: G. gets 50% of output.

F.O. Only 50% of output of mines other than ours. Amb. to-day: likely to get 1.800 tons. Agree even that = too much.

M/P. Possible tht., if you do this to Azores, P. might get more Wolfram &amp; we correspgly. less. We might get on without. Importance = supply to Germany.

F.O. U.S. don’t care: not their allies: no likely re-action in U.S.

S/Doms. New suggn tht. this is urgent &amp; vital. Prev. we were told only that it was desirable.

Remember we can’t save P. fr. attack by Axis.

200

L.P. If absolutely essential we’d have to do it. But wolfram: put ourselves in wrong.

A.V.A. C.O.S. memo is dated 10/5: no reason known why we shd. change our view.

V.C.I.G.S. The C.N.S. never wished to give impn tht. we’d lose the B/Atlantic w’out Azores. Read C.O.S. memo.

Then Alcove 181. dated 12/5. from S/Doms &amp; F.O. embodying views of Def. Cttee.

F.O. Maisky to-day. R., tho’ expectg. attack, have’nt had it. If G. don’t attack on R. front they wd. have reserves wh. they cd. send into Spain if we did this.

V.C.I.G.S. R. front is major G. problem: and they can’t divert much from it.

Seeing our prepns in Med. G. dare not move reserves into Peninsula.

S/Doms. Effect on Husky of G. occupn of Peninsula?

A.V.A. Serious for passage of W. Med.

M/P. Compensated by extra strain on Germans.

V.C.A.S. Wd. be serious. But not easy for G. to do. Cd. divert air strength fr.

Russia, but much more likely to use it in central Med.

L.P.S. Saving 1 m. tons of shipping (P.M.) How long for that to mature?

8/9 months.

M/P. P.M. exaggerates element of surprise if value of Port. Army is put so low. No serious reason why you shdn’t give them the warning involved by starting by negotiation.

V.C.I.G.S. Don’t minimise the fight wh. P. on defensive might make v. our sea-borne landing.

M/L. a) Wd. spoil Husky by diverson of shipping.

b) Something still to be gained by treating an Ally decently.

S/Doms. My objn is doing this to an Ally when we can’t defend her. We cd., &amp; did, defend Greece in 1916.

A.V.A. P.M.’s telegram over-rides the advice given prev. by C.O.S.

After Sept. our escort increase comes in. In summer, if this done &amp; escorts diverted, we shd. have to stand a heavy loss of merchant tonnage.

201

Diff. to persuade Ally tht. this is vital after P.M.’s recent reference to success in U-Boat warfare in last 3 wks.

V.C.I.G.S. Mil.ques. is in para 7.

Ref. in para 4 “next 3 or 4 wks” – not nec. the basis of the plan.

C.O.S. wd. insist tht. Husky shd. have priority &amp; tht. this shdn’t be done until it cd. be done w’out prejudice to Husky.

W.O. Mil. objns go only to time.

Real objn is the moral one. Vital to retain some shred of integrity for post-war.

M/L. a) Moral ground b) Mil. wrong to divert forces fr. Medn.

S/Doms. Moral issue: only thing wh. cd. over-ride that = absolute necessity: no case yet made out for that.

H.O. a) Husky must be safeguarded. b) But subject to that I sympathise with P.M.’s desire . Adv. of havg. Azores must be put v. high.

c) If we try diplomatic approach, I wd. have thought most unlikely he’d agree. Then forewarned, with little advantage. d) Port. Have not behaved twds. As “oldest ally”. e) Re-action of B. public not likely to be unfavourable eg. Altmark &amp; Torch.

L.P.S. Against this. Our power in the world depends on our behaving well. In the long run we shd. lose by it.

S/Doms. On. H.O. view, why haven’t we taken the Irish bases.

F.O. Gains of trying dipl. approach first are v. great.

Loss only putting P. on their guard.

M.P Tactics. Tell P.M. only that “our mil. advice is tht. this can’t be done for x months: let us therefore discuss on yr. return wtr. it shd. be rape or courtship.”

W.O. Objn P.M. is settling strategy for a year ahead.

M/P. My formula: preceded by statement that we don’t like this at all.

II. Ceylon: Constutional Reform.

P.M. Doesn’t dissent. Decision stands.

202

III. Godfroy.

A.V.A. Proposes to signal to Vichy tht. he is going to adhere to Giraud.

Recd. message fr. Vichy notifying him of promotion of one of his offrs.

Have told him to take no action.

Giraud will be contacted: &amp; asked to order him not to communicate with Vichy.

Hope he will obey their orders.

Agreed: leave it to C-in-C. Med. &amp; Giraud.
