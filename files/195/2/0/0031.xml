W.M.(43) 34th Meeting 23rd February 1943

I. Invasion Areas – Visitors’ Ban.

H.O. Wd. propose in any event to retain restrictions on persons takg. up permanent residence.

Last year maintained suspension of Ban for prolonged period.

No justificn. for maintaining this ban unless v. strong military reasons for it.

Don’t want to destroy the “invasion mentality” – but public aren’t fools.

W.O. Our main point is not that : it is preparations for offensive action.

We shan’t want people unnecessarily to see what we are doing. Fact tht. we are preparing will be known to Germans : but we can and shd. conceal the detail.

Security argument – whatever other kind of D.R. may be necessary for that.

K.W. But you are makg. these preparations in other areas.

W.O. We shall want later to extend the ban westwards.

C.I.G.S. We shall later have to deny entry to coastline : and over a wide area to provide cover.

Better however to re-shape the negns. with a view to offensive operations.

x/. Extend present suspension of ban to ¼ and meanwhile reshape the plan.

M/H. a) Present instrument appropriate to new purposes : insufft. control also.

b) “Further west” raises v. gt. civilian problems. Earlier proposal to extend present ban to Lyme Regis failed because of extent of economic damage to fresh communities.

S/Doms. Para 8. This control gives you v. little security protection. Business visitors can come in freely.

L.P. I. of W. is a v. difft. approach – this is what you want.

Agreed as at x/. Civil Dpts to consider with W.O.

95

I. of W. to be treated separately : C.D.Cttee to consider the point about steamer traffic.

II. Training for the Building Industry.

M/L. Results of Cttee apptd. by Reith. Plan meets 2 needs a) absorption of labour while industry is re-tooled b) arrears of bldg.

All Dpts. concur in White Paper. Wish to announce in Parlt. this week.

Bldg. industry have virtually agreed to absorb large no. of trainees – thus avoidg. tragedy of period after last war. Scheme wd. be reviewed if programme doesn’t in fact require these nos : but they are minimum nos.

A.V.A. Para 4. Not intended to retain Ess. Work Order?

M/L. Want something like the guaranteed week. Must avoid casual system if we are to get remits.

K.W. Too early to specify details : but nec. to provide tht. employers can carry out guarantee.

T.J. Reduction fr. 1.4m to 1.25 doesn’t involve scaling down of programme. No?

Only applns. for 200 places in traing. scheme now. Publicity will be needed to back this White Paper.

M/L. Intend that Lobby corresp. : regional conferences with the trade.

Need to create confidence in the industry – and we can do it.

Better relations than ever in the trade.

H.O. Para 3 is provisional : I don’t therefore dissent from it.

But Cab. shd. realise tht. this all depends on capital available for investment and priority demands upon it. Man can’t live by bldg. alone.

eg. what we said on Bev. Rept.

K.W. Supported this point. Para 3 was amended with this in view

But remember this is the most fruitful source of emplt. I am satisfied with this statement and think it important that it shd. be made.

Draft White Paper approved.

96

III. N.Atlantic Convoys.

L. No. of ships have increased : nos. now awaiting convoys : complicated by enlarging cycle fr. 6/8 days.

More than 80 ships now per convoy. In Jan. Admy. put a ceiling of 60 but this has bn. raised to 80. x/. Now U.S. say it sho’ not go above 60.

Now U.S. also say tht. they won’t give us more shipping if we can’t eliminate the convoy delays.

Essential therefore either to have no ceiling for nos. of ships per convoy. or to have more escorts.

A.V.A. x/. U.S. attitude : because of repercussions if U.S. seamen lost in large : inadequately escorted convoys.

We have on occasion put nos. up to 90. But we weren’t then contendg. with large packs of U-Boats.

Convoys above a certain size v. diff. to hold together : and stragglers now almost always get lost.

C.N.S. We had considered all the disadvantages but we decided we must take the risk.

But U.S. have the whip-hand because they will hold back their ships.

L. They can by this means defeat the Lyttelton agreement.

We must increase our imports.

C.N.S. Easier to run 80 ship convoy than to run extra convoy.

But as U.S. have turned first alternative down, we must re-consider second.

Can’t say where escort ships will come from. Might ask U.S. to provide balance of escorts. If they refuse, somethg. else must give way.

L. Need we accept the U.S. attitude w’out demur.

You were proposg. to increase propn. of escort vessels : have you told U.S. this?

97

And at what level shd. you tell them?

S/Doms. Press them again on highest level your (Admy) can : and promise the addl. escorts if you can.

L. to make simultaneous approach to Harriman : for Hopkins.

L. This will recur and increase throughout the year.

C.N.S. Moor can put this long-term point at this present conference in U.S.A.

Agreed. (C.S.A.B. Ldn. to Washington )

(Harriman to Hopkins ) referring to War Cab. wishes.

(Admy. to U.S. Navy )
