W.M.(43) 57th Meeting. 21st April, 1943.

I Material Stocks &amp; Procution Programmes.

M/P. 15.6 m. reduced to 13.4 m. Now is 12.2 m., with float wh. M/S. will draw on as little as poss. Plan to consume 12.5 m. if float is called on. This provides for S.C. cut of 400.000. If imports = 13 m. stock at end 43 will be 400.000. below Dec. ’42 - consid. improvement on present level.

Cuts mainly on M/S who agrees memo.

M.A.P. This affect my steel?

M/P. No: will fall wholly on M/S. No further cut on M.A.P.

Cherwell. Agree because estimate of imports may be optimistic. Any excess imports will go into stocks via consumption.

M/L. Will this involve unemployment?

M/P. Labour force over-all for 43 will exceed that of ’42. Can’t guarantee no pockets of unemployment.

M/L. Timing.

M/S. Bound to be risk of unemployment. If you cut down to conserve materials, you can’t guarantee that people won’t be released at times &amp; places where they can’t be re-absorbed.

M/L V. awkward in places where transfer of labour. Para 8 of memo. goes beyond present arrangements.

M/P. There will be come local unemployment.

120.000 prev. cut in M/S. by end ’43: now proposed to accelerate this to end Sept.

M/L. Risk of a run of labour – all going home because idea spreads that people aren’t needed.

Cherw. Only amounts to 30/40.000.

M/L. That quantity, if timid, shd. not upset the machine.

170

M/S. Our prev. releases were to free labour, for wh. there was a demand. Now we are being asked to cut, to save materials. We can’t time that to suit M/Labour.

M/L. But collaborate with me, so tht. any possible recruits for Army can be drawn off.

M/P. Content to use existing machinery.

Shipping Situation.

P.M. Shipping Rpt. M/F. can apparently carry on with less than in 1941. Why?

M/F. Because in 1941 undisclosed stocks in consumer/retailers etc., hands had not bn. fully exhausted.

L.P. Misleading to reckon only on gobal figures. For we now have special diffies. On items: and this needs a “cushion” in the global totals.

M/F. E.g. bacon now depends on current deliveries.

Cherw. Explain this to U.S., who are always triying to drive down our minimum figures.

P.M. Per contra, dispersal = larger stocks: &amp; air-raid risk diminished.

Material Stocks &amp; production programmes (contd.)

P.M. Accept M/P. Report: but bear in mind needs of Army for more men.

M/L. Agree: place on record need to plan this so that proper a/c is taken of the man-power needs.

M/P. We must make these reductions qua materials, but equally we must do so in the way most likely to meet the diffies of M/Labour.

P.M. Cab. shd. be warned of any large discharges w’out prospect of quick re-absorption. Anything over 500 in any one place.

M/P. Prefer monthly report.

Bombing of Essen: Poison Gas: Home Guard.

P.M. Message from Stalin. Congrats. to Bomber Squadrons re. Essen.

Reason to believe G. will use gas on R. front.

171

Will issue immediate warning of retaliation - from No. 10 to-morrow - to re-inforce H.O. warning y’day. Tone up machine?

H.O. Have done all that’s necessary.

M.A.P. Get everyone to produce their masks at their factory. H.O. will consider that.

P.M. Let H.G. carry masks on their celebration parade. Also let them mount guard at Buck. Pal.

Shipping Situation.

P.M. Can’t promise 66 ships a month.

W.O. Don’t ask for that – only tht. no firm decision be now taken against.

In Washington they wtill think we’re aiming at 27m. tons.

P.M. Read revised draft of telegram to Washington.

W.O. I do wish to commit Washgton. to 66 ships.

Cherw. We must say we are considering our position - or we’ll be committed to 66.

M/W.T. Washington aware of 26 m. in S.C. Rpt. We’ve said this assumes 19 m by us + 7 m. by U.S. The 26.4 m. = requirement: but we don’t expect it. They will infer they must work on 26 m.

Cherw. Say it’s somewhere betwn. 26 m and 26.4 m.: and we are considering what we can do with least prejudice to our plans.

P.M. There is a margin because of hopes to have smaller losses.

I wd. fight on 26.4 m.

M/W.T. They will say - because you want more fr. us or because you think you can do more with your own.

P.M. Our rock must be the 7 m. tons offer. No whittling away of that.

a) Despatch telegram as drafted.

b) On 26 or 26.4, we don’t see doig more than 19.: or more than 7 fr. U.S. L.P. &amp; M/W.T. preferred to take 26 m.

Agreed: stet. 26 m. tons

172

Government Building Programme.

M/P. Labour fixed to 31/3. But defic. Rising to 55.ooo btwn. Supply &amp; demand. No good trying to meet so large a gap by my allocations.

M/L Believe Labour is enough for programme: not influenced by estimates.

W.O. Not much more slowing down of Bolero: unless you stop works already started.

P.M. Too much upkeep of roads?

M.A.P. May cost more rubber.

L.P. L.a.’s wasting labour?

M/L. Direct that programme be carried thro’ on present labour force: it will be done.

W.O. Cuts pro rata, to avoid argument.

S/Air. No: must have regard to priorities.

M/L. Transfer more bldg. work to M/Works &amp; you’ll get more economy.

P.M. ( W.O. &amp; Air Min Ministry to show cause why further transfers to M/Works shd. not be made. L.P.Cttee.

P.M. ( M/P. to make allocations &amp; let the appeals come together, to War Cabinet.
