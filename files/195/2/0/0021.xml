W.M.(43) 18th Meeting 27th January 1943

I. P.M.’s Meeting with Turks.

A.E. Cab. shd not consent to P.M.’s going to Angora. Security posn. bad when I was there – even worse now. Physical diffies. also – prob. will go by train.

Balance of advantages – meet in Cyprus.

M.A.P. In train on frontier?

A. E. Syria not v. good.

V.I.C.G.S. Plenty of troops there.

A.E. Better on B. soil

S/Doms. Agreed Cyprus.

M.A.P. Much better to meet President than S : and more likely tht. he wd. come to frontier.

A.E. Not sure: something to be said for leavg. P.M. a loophole not havg. seen President.

M.A.P. Say Cyprus unless some mtg. on frontier with Prs. cd. conveniently be arranged.

A.E. Tho’ B. troops cd. be sent to frontier that wd. become known.

Read proposed draft.

L.P. Shd. we not at least indicate in telegram the alternative of mtg. at Frontier.

“We shd. not take same serious view of severity ques. if mtg. cd. be arranged in train at some isolated place on the frontier.” Addg. a) Takg. pol. and security grds together. On balance Cab. shd. have thought better Cyprus with S. rather than Ismet in Turkey. b) Tho’ there wd. be advantages in mtg. with Ismet. fr. security pt. of view we shd. prefer Cyprus. Agreed b) instead of a).

II. Prisoners of War : Shackling.

A.E. Canadian mil. now agree with me.

69

V.C.I.G.S. With proviso – he wd. support our view : but he thought his support wd. be of no effect on Can. Govt. unless A.E.’s telegram went to Can. Govt. If it went to Canada in draft we cd. telegraph in advance supporting it.

S/Doms. Para 3 reads like admn. of past fault. Say ‘further orders’.

Para 5 suggest G. justified in their attitude.

M/P. Contracdn. betwn. 3 and 4. Doesn’t 3 conflict with statement that Conv. applies at once.

K.W. Stand on prev. text unless G. Govt. likely to be influenced.

V.C.I.G.S. Can. C.G.S. wd. prob support old draft. It was merits not wording we discussed.

Bruce. Aust. Govt. wd. prefer first draft. This won’t alter G. attitude ¨and it will give occasion for argument. – partic. on ques. when pr. comes under Convent. i.e. when he becomes a p. of war.

A.E. D.O. Tel. 8. to Canada. 12/1 = the old draft.

Agreed – adhere to that draft.

2) Tell Can. Govt – stressing that no ½ way house betwn. this and agreeing to G. condns.

1) Get Can. C.G.S. to telegraph in support.

3). Then send reply to Swiss Govt. and announce in H/C. on Tuesday.

Bruce on 2) Can. Govt fear this draft will provoke denunciation of Gen. Conventn. Put in 2) therefore the answer : no change of wordg. will prevent that if G. wish to denounce.

III. Post War Economic Policy – Debate.

K.W. Terms of resolution agreed. Plans all ready.

Intend to foreshadow need to continue controls after the war.

No mention however of food rationing. Agreed.

IV. Secret Session in H/Lords.

Cranb. Hankey is puttg. down notion on U-boat warfare, in wh. we will go into reasons for our previous failure. His speech may be ok but diff. for Govt to ques. a full reply.

70

Agreed : go into S. Session.

V. Catering Wages Bill.

M/L. 1) “all such investigns. …..” 2) “Shall consider written upns and shall make such further enquiries as they consider necessary………………

L.P. Enquiries may be public. Meet first point. It doesn’t meet the full safeguards of T.B.A. legn. But I will support this on ground tht. Order has to be laid.

K.W. Content to see how it develops.
