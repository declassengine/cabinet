M/P. Best I can do with labout available.

Memo. by S/Air points extreme picture -

a) because takes insuff. a/c of concentn on most urgent work.

b) makes no allowce. for v. good weather.

W.O. If we are to be ready by 1/4/44, we can’t defer the call-up.

Bldg. Labour. I will proceed by allowg. all conflict betwn. our requirements &amp; Bolero to be resolved in favour of my requirements.

A.V.A I will be content.

S/Air. I can’t take this cut w’out new policy decisions.

As rgds. M/P. remarks. a) inconsistent with his earlier Memo.

My estimates have bn. v. thoroughly scrutinised by M/P. &amp; survived.

b) doesn’t apply because my calculations

not based on what we cd. do p. month –

averaged over the year.

I cut my requirements. below safety margin: omitting reserve for contingencies.

Actually we’ve done only 27% as against 30% of programme.

M/P. Has whole shortfall in labour force bn. applied to these aerodromes? Has it bn. spread over all Air Minn work.

S/Air. No: it has been spread.

Scottish rural housing. Arithmetically allocn shd. be doubled - if the labour is available.

M/L. Can’t produce men for Army (as P.M. desires) &amp; for bldg.

Economy cd. be secured by transferring men to M/Works.

The jobs cd. be done with total labour available if they were more efficiently used.

S/Air. Strong arguments v. the transfer. E.g. our knowledge of actual requirements of operational squadrons.

M/L. No reason why Air Min. staff shdn’t go to M/W. to deal with these planning ques. All I want is to secure tht. all control of bldg. labour &amp; operations is w’in control of single Dpt.

E.g. 1.000 skilled builders empld. On maintenance alone in Aldershot.

L.P. We agreed in principle to transfer &amp; Ty. is considering detailed appln

M/W. Referred to M.A.P. arrangement.

S/Air. But on a more optimistic view of these economies, it wd. not bridge the gap.

K.W. Expedite review of transfer proposals: &amp; see what we can get out of it.

S/Doms. You are askg. for an allocation wh. must be at expense of Army.

S/Air. To enable me to fulfil my programme.

M/P. By a certain date. My proposals only involve delaying completion.

S/Air. Either I get the labour or the policy must be altered.

M/P. Must admit U.S. may be more up to date in future in arrival of squadrons.

S/Air. Suggest I confer with M/P. &amp; then put the cost to C.O.S. here &amp; in Washington, in policy of accepting this cut.

M/L. ? Reduce standards for bldgs on aerodromes. More pre-fabricated materials.

198

M/H. Warning about growing diffy. over housing.

S/Doms. Must go to Def. Cttee.

L/P. Room for techn. enquiry into more economical standards? By independent expert, provided by M/Works, to consider with Service repres (Air Miny).

Also U.S. shd. be told authoritatively tht. their standards must be reduced.

W.O. The U.S. must be forced to send over more construction troops in first wave. Agreed.

S/Doms. Def. Cttee must decide between Army &amp; R.A.F.

M/P. All this bother is over 2 months’ delay in completion date. Not imposs. tht. technical devices may go some way to bridge that gap.

W.O. Meanwhile, can’t we proceed on this allocation. We must have some decision.

S/Doms. Will M/P. put the issue in form to submit to C.O.S. here &amp; Washington.

1. for decision of strategic grounds.

2. Also Barlow enquiry &amp; techn. enquiry as suggd by L.P.

3. Operate on this Memo. until it is changed, for purpose of immed. allocations.

W.O. And I can’t accept any postponement of call-up.

M/L. Accept this memo. &amp; instruct Depts. to make do. When they know they won’t get more men, they will for the first time find alternative means.

M/W.T My Dpt. alarmed about cut in our programme - 25% of our allocation. We shall have to allow a deterioration of highways wh. wd. affect rubber &amp; petrol economies &amp; efficiency of transport. Wd. like to discuss with M/P. &amp; W.O.
