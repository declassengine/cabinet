W.M.(43) 80th Meeting. 3rd June, 1943.

I. Airfield Construction: Building Labour.

M/P. Since memo. new factors.

We have throughout taken risks – cutting short ? on W.O. – on assumption tht. U.S. won’t achieve their promises. Passing that stage now: in air anyhow reason to think U.S. will begin to arrive.

U.S. have put in written request for men to accelerate airfield constn.

Saw M/L. y’day: can’t re-establish original figures: but I asked M/L. to stand-still on bldg. call-up. We now say call-up of bldg. labour be put at back of pack for June.

M/L. Notices issued for 7.000 bldg. labour for 3/6.

Another 7.000 due for 17/6. Agreed to put them at back if pack: will try to find them fr. other industries or fr. bldg. not on airfields.

Promised steady inflow to Army because of training arrangements. Must therefore try to find the 7.000 from other sources.

90.000 for July/August &amp; 80.000 for Sept. I will postpone. i.e. no withdrawals fr. airfields, as fr. 3/6 to end/Sept.

M/P. U.S. fields unsatis. because no agreement wht. they want.

Mtg Fri. - schedule of work to be given dates &amp; agreed with U.S. If they don’t agree, they will have to bring in own labour to accelerate.

S/Air. In addn Washington Conf. appd U.S. bombing plan. Heavy bombers (703 now) coming in fast. U.S. say (&amp; C.A.S. agrees) essentl. for them to attack G. fighter factories else they will outpace the offensive: this means large no. bombers needed for deep penetration. b) need of U.S. for depots wh. we cut out.

M/P. Does this mean more fields than now planned?

S/Air. Yes.

W.O. Same with me. New programme of arrivals involves re-inserting 4 depots wh. I had deleted fr. programme.

S/Air. If we adhered to W.P.219 at A. we shd. be short by 4 U.S. &amp; 2 R.A.F. stations short by end/Sept. Due to a) diffy of labour in E. Anglia

We can’t afford to go below that.

M/L. Demand 110.000. Given 90.000. If extra 20.000 man effort needed, I can get it taking over w’out extra men. I estimate you have x thousands in W. 212

Scotland wh. is not urgent &amp; cd. be transferred. If the man-power were in one pool, I cd. get extra flexibility.

Misuse of labour at airfield at Desborough.

Now it is merely a pool of labour.

S/Air. Our use of labour has survived examination by M/P. and M/W. I will submit to decision on this by L.P. Cttee.

M/P. Tho’ work is done efficiently by Air Miny, it may still be true that you wd. greater mobility by creating one pool.

M/L. Don’t want to break up the bldg. organisation of Serv. Dpts.

W.O. Not so simple as M.A.P. because our organisation is mil/civil inextricably mixed.

M/L. arrangemts described earlier may mean W.O. won’t get their intake. Will, however, accept M/L. assurance tht. our intake will be found fr. other sources.

W.O. bldg. for U.S. If they come in Dec/Feb. in nos. contemplated they will have to go into tents in Spring of ’44.

New demand = 5.000 extra civilian labour fr. now to

x/ Oct. ie. for 3/ 4 months.

M/L. Inspectn of W.O. maintenance staff: by M/L. M/W. &amp; W.O.

jointly. Wd. expect to

y/ draw fr. these much twds. new demand.

W.O. The depots for dispersal are essential.

I will take chances on living accommn &amp; hospitals, but not on that.

Agreed x/ to be met by y/ &amp; other M/L devices.

S/Doms. Airfields. Met largely by postponements as expld. by M/P.

&amp; M/L.

M/L. believes lift of 20.000 in man effort can be secured thro’ transfer of responsibility to M/Works.

M/L. If all bldg. labour under one control, I wd. put a ring round all: &amp; wd. move the men where I wanted to put them acc. to my view of

priorities – because I know what the P.M. wants.

W.O. Proposn before was transfer of bldg. responsibility.

L.P. But M/L. wants one authy to deal with (i.e. M/Works) not several.

One Dpt. dealing with the contractors.

213

Enquiry - to see what is wanted.

L.P. L.P. Cttee: decision in principle: Cttee under Barlow has report in draft:

that will expose diffies: we must face this - if bldg. labour to be in one

pool some one authority will have to exercise discretion over bldg. work

of Services.

Mtg. of L.P. Cttee with Service Ministers early next week to consider

Barlow’s Rpt.

M/L. Other diffy. – I can’t go to Unions w’out fear of being let down as on

Bolero.

M/W. My diffy. - M/P. looks to me to co-ordinate but I can’t do it w’out getting

all the informn fr. Service Dpts.

S/Air. If we can retain priorities on Air Min’y work, and get all the labour I want,

I wd. agree.

W.O. Who wouldn’t?

M/W. Allocation of materials - with 22 Dpts - works v. satisfactorily.

S/Air. But I can’t surrender to M/L. the decision on priorities.

Unless tht. authy can take tht. responsibility he can’t do any good.

M/L. On bldg., you accept allocation of materials by M/Works – why not labour?

W.O. Different in practice, if not in principle.

S/Doms. ? Decide on 15.000 deferment.

% {Transfer ques.: to be considered at once, as proposed.

S/Air. a) can we get more fr. the 200.000 immobile bldg. labour.

b) Can U.S. ship move constructional troops.

M/P. On b) this wd. have same effect in delaying operations because shipping is bottleneck.

Prefer to proceed as overleaf - get agreement with U.S.

S/Air. Can we have majority in E. Anglia?

S/Doms. That arises anyhow.

{ (Want this request recorded)

Agreed - as at %.

214

M.A.P. If this means takg. substantial nos. fr. M.A.P., we shall have to reduce our programme.

Standards.

M/W. Standards of bldg. = the same. Standards of accommn. Higher

S/Air. Double bunking a) materials in short supply. M/Works denied this.

b) increased risk of cerebro. spinal meningitis –

involvg. 16.000 addl. hospital beds.

W.O. We’ve had no significant increase.

S/Doms. No reason for diffce between

Admy. } &amp; R.A.F.

W.O. }

c) U.S. standard = 14. We must be able to move

squadrons as betwn. U.S. &amp; U.K.; &amp; we can’t ask

U.S. to sleep 18 in a hut.

But prepd to consider with M/Works.

Decided: standard of 18 p. hut to be adopted.

Para 4 - misunderstanding. a) reluctance of contractor to release before his scheduled date even tho’ work finished. b) slowness of. M/L. machine.

S/Doms. Points in W.P. 220 to be settled by L.P. Cttee.

L.P. This is difft. fr. original remit to L.P. Cttee.

Let M/W. indicate in memo. how he wd. exercise this responsibility.

II. Salaries of Junior Ministers. K.W. Met the Ministers (I, H.O. &amp; Simon). Grave diffces of views.

30 present: 15 voted against, 14 in favour. One didn’t vote.

Mtg. swayed by Tomlinson, who said he didn’t want to be put in the post of havg his personal benefit discussed.

Doubt therefore wtr I can go fwd.They thought it wd. create adverse comment in country.

Agreed - drop it.
