W.M.(43) 53rd Meeting. 13th April, 1943.

I. Food Conference.

P.M. Incln. of Eire - overwhelming arguments against. Read draft telegram.

A.R. “Pl explain our views to U.S.G. &amp; tell them we shd. prefer them not to be invited to Confce.” In lieu of 2nd para.

Agreed.

II. Foreign Secretary’s Account of his Mission to Washington.

A.E. Politial ques. Main point U.S.-U.S.S.R. relations. President troubled - feels Litvinov’s posn in Moscow less influential than Maisky: also troubled about his Amb. in Moscow: wants send Davies back when well enough to go. They don’t tell R. as much as we do abt. day-to-day dipl. events. I suggested eg. U.S. Amb. Moscow shd. give them full a/c our talks.

USSR. Terr. claims. Reconciled to Baltic States - fait accompli. Wd. like plebiscite as conscience clause.

Polish frontier. If P. got E. Russia &amp; something in E. Siberia, P. wd. well to accept the Curzon Line. Tactics: we, U.S. &amp; R. shd. agree fair solution &amp; get P. to accept it: better than letting negotns between R. &amp; P to get into mess.

Finland: no anxiety: thought terms reasonable. But Welles nervous re want assistce. pact ? Protectorate. I said take this up with R.

Public feeling in U.S. twds R. No sentiment as here, but on whole not unreasonable, even in Rep. Party. “We shan’t be any worse off for havg. tried to come to terms with them.” Hoover line is difft. - wd. like closer relations between U.K. &amp; U.S. in order to keep away fr. R.

Our attitude to R. - v. curious about it.

French: Hull loathes de G. &amp; intrudes him into every conversation. Much complaint too about our failure to put U.S. view on French. I concentrated therefore on future. One diffce - U.S., even if G. &amp; de G. come together, don’t want to see one

154

central Fr. authy. - prefer to deal with several. I said we wd. like one, even tho’ we don’t recognise it as a Govt. All the others came out as Govts., wh. puts them in diff. posn. Diff. see why U.S. take this view - unless because want to internationalise some Fr. possessions. Even if we go into Fr., they don’t want a Fr. authy. to go in they wd. prefer us to take responsib. for civil adminn.: i.e. opposite view to that on wh. they act in N. Africa.

Pol. side of mil. opns. - agree gone ill in N. Africa. State Dpt. don’t have our close relns. with C.O.S. etc. Agreed shd. try to work out machinery for closer contact. Cd. we send out F.O. man to help Dill? - said we’d consider. Change mainly reqd. is on U.S. side.

Trend of U.S. opinion - away fr. isolation. My contacts confirmed view of Pres. etc. Welles hoped Senate wd. pass resoln soon givg. Pres. more latitude in pursuit of his policy. Pres. thinks this is best development - avoid Wilson’s separation fr. Senate until faced with Treaty. Bringing Congressme etc., into Conferences. Eve of my departure I was shown by 2 members of F.A. Cttee of Congress draft of such a resoln.

Basis of U.S. co-opn. World-wide basis essential - also China wd. have to come in:

a) U.S. hatred of Japan (not same feeling v. Hitler): b) fears of China lapsing into chaos. c) China as counterpoise to R. in Far East.

(Pro-China feeling helps him to bring on opinion favouring war v. Hitler)

Elaborn of organ. cannot be left wholly to U.K. &amp; U.S. This leads Pres. to play up U.N. on every occasion.

Form. (1) Genl. Assembly, covering all, mtg once or twice a year = Assembly of L/N.

(2) Adv. Council - 4 Govt. Powers (incl. China) &amp; 6 or 8 others to be chosen prob. by Continents. v. near Council of L/N.

(3) Executive of 4 Gt. Powers exercising wide powers delegated by (2). Attached to this an offl. like Sec. Genl. of L/N. “Moderator” Authy. to communicate with (3) or (2) on issues requiring their attendce.

Talked to Welles re Council of Europe. He thought room for this Sub-Cttee of (2). Subjects to be discussed - wd. they deal with

155

pol. ques: he felt prob. not. See no special diffy. except (3): I believe most will have to be done by (2).

Germany. V. tough attitude. Welles vehemently in favour of dismemberment. They’ve gone into it v. carefully. (P.M. “Liberation of minor components”!) In our mil. occupn we shd. proceed jointly in each area (BA.R.). G. wd. be broken up in mil. occupn into areas approx. to eventual break-down into parts. Pres. agreed, less vehemently. Hull hadn’t made up his mind. I agreed tht. this solution shdn’t be excluded &amp; we wd. consider details. Argument (Welles) - G. bound to have a grievance: therefore give her a good one. “Don’t maltreat your enemy by halves.” (P.M.)

Barvaria: N.Western: Prussia (less E. Prussia etc.): Ruler under internatt. supervision.

Austria sep. at first, tho’ later with Bavaria: Saxony.

P.M. Centripetal tendency of G. will be strong. Poss. ??? in time to implement other ideas. E.g. Confedn. of Danube, as central European bloc. If Wurtemburg joined, it wd. be poss. To go easier with G. states wh. close to Vienna via Berlin.

Czechs. wd. like to join with Poland, if they made proper arrangement with R. If not, they wd. turn twds. Vienna.

M/L. Build up inter-State commerce &amp; with it will come strong T.U.’s bridging the frontiers. Get connecting link thro’ communications.

A.E. Their new idea = fr. 1st our mil. zones shd co-incide with eventual divisions.

Belgium – new State of Wallonia. (Pres.)

France - Indo-China internationalised: Also Dakar &amp; Bizerta (Pres.)

Welles reminded him of declns in favour integrity of Fr. Empire.

Only 4 Gt. Powers to have arms – none for smaller countries. Believe Pres. has dropped that .

P.M. Europe based on comp. mil. service. Any Fr. Govt. wd. insist on Army - so wd. Poland. Can’t wean Europe fr. this conception &amp; excessive nat. armament is by establishment of Council/Europe with internatl. Forces capable of enforcing its decisions. Each constituent country cd. begin by dedicating a portion of its natl.

156

forces to serve at bidding of Council. A natural part of the U.S. of Europe idea.

A.E. One amendment: Authy. directing that Force shd. be (2) overleaf: the body corresponding body to Council of L/N.

M.A.P. Build up the Army of Occupation on that basis from the start.

A.E. Far East. Manchuria Formoso - to China.

Jap. Mandated Islands - internationalised.

Korea - indep. Republic with internat. ?????? to start with.

Siam, Indo-China, Burma &amp; Malaysia: Chinese Amb. said China had no ambition in resp. of these.

P.M. Basis. 1.000 Islands in Pacific &amp; 500 have harbours. B. interest tht. U.S. shd. be secure. War between U.K. &amp; U.S. is unthinkable therefore mobility of U.S. sea &amp; air power = essential B. interest. No need therefore to get into a fuss about Islands.

A.E. Civil Aviation. U.S. Govt, haven’t yet cleared their minds. I arranged we wd. both go on clearing our minds: we say when ready to discuss: meanwhile avoid any public discussion.

Colonial Declaration. Hull has produced new draft, wh. I didn’t see till I left. Bad fr. our point of view. Suggest Ministers shd. look again at this in light of new draft.

III. North Africa - Command of Husky.

P.M. U.S. idea that Husky shd. be Am. enterprise. We have suggd administratively convenient to have B. commander + joint staff all under Eisenhower. But we may have to argue on basis tht. command goes with major forces. In Tunisia we are now 12:4 contrary to original expectns. And no U.S. Navy goes inside Med. On this, Husky cdn’t be more than equal share. Don’t feel we shd. give way.

A.E. Wd. like to tell Macmillan we are against this - Agreed.
