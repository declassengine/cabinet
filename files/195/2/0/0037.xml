W.M.(43) 40th Meeting. 15th March, l943.

Military Operations.

V.C.I.G.S. Tunisia.

Enemy attacks slackened save in area in N. 3 attacks on 11/3: all unsuccessful: 200 prs.

14/3 local attack to high ground E. of Tamara: not successful. Elsewhere only patrols in North. Lost 1.500 + 2.000 since 26/2. 10.000 since start of campaign.

Centre. French patrols.

U.S. no further advance. 3 Divns. concentrating there.

South. Fr. irregulars have moved up twds. Gapsa.

6th Arm. Divn. re-equipped by 17/3 (Shearmans): delayed for 17 days thro’ surrender of some tanks to U.S. for replacements.

1st Inf. Divn. will be concentd in fwd. area by 1/4.

? 24th .. .. .. .. .. .. .. by mid/April.

In north: rains still makg. tank opns imposs. on our front.

Eighth Army: fwd. move complete by 19/3. 50th Divn

already fwd.

In R.’s attack on 8th Army. 52 G. tanks destroyed, all but 9 by infantry 6 pdrs.

10/3. G. sent column v. F. French, who withdrew to South. R.A.F. attacked: &amp; enemy withdrew next day.

The Shotts not passable until mid/May.

3.500 b.p. day average discharge at Tripoli. for latest week – exclg. bulk petrol.

880 b.p. day at Benghazi. Redn on prev. week.

By 12/3 we should have 21 days reserve for 6 Divns.

116

54.000 v. 8th Army = ration strength. Little M.T.

Tank strength 100/120. G. 24 I.

P.M. 2 Panzer Divns have fewer tanks than one B. brigade.

Russia.

Thaw pretty good.

North: attacks s. L. Ilmen prob. ceased.

Centre: Vyazma break thro’ successful. G. withdrawal prob. planned. Tho’ don’t know where they will stand.

Orel: No development of R. threat in last week.

Kharkov: Mainly fr. W. G. have made good progress. G. claim prob. true tht. bulk of city in their hands. 20/25 G. Divins empld prob. the whole of their strategic reserve. In Donetz looks as tho’ G. have no bridgeheads across the river.

Taman: Thought tht. R. won’t be able to put on large pressure until mid/April.

Weather will thus enable G. to get most of them away.

G. have moved 16 Divns. fr. France: but many of these replaced fr. Russia &amp; Germany.

Result 18 static 12 mobile Divns. in France: whereas previously proportions were the opposite.

Giraud and de Gaulle.

R.Law. Giraud’s speech. He has come long way to meet F. Nat. Cttee. Of 4 condns laid down by Cttee. 2 fulfilled 100% &amp; the others more than 50%. Genuine basis for agreement.

No direct rfce to release of prs. or changes in adminn.

Ev. Standard: decln by De Gaulle. Not v. encouraging.

Suggest that AE. shd. (as suggd. by Macmillan) provoke joint GB-US statement welcomg. Giraud’s advance – makg it clear tht. in our opinion no difference of principle betwn the 2 sides.

117

P.M.. de G. actuated by personal motives: “title-deeds of France in his pocket.” Giraud a much better man: and de.G. probably bitter enemy of G.B.

L.P.S. Motion in H/Lords Wedgwood on diffies military and political in N. Africa.

Can I say anythg. about G.’s speech?

P.M. Not until after joint decln.

Get W. to postpone for a day or two.

L.P.S. Will try to bat it off.

Communist Party.

P.M. Amend your memo. by going back a year or two before ’39.

H.O. Wd. like to publish White Paper. But a) reaction on U.S.S.R. b) secret sources.

P.M. Strain it &amp; see what cd. be published at the appropriate time.

Newfoundland.

S/Doms. Commn on Civil Servants with no political sense.

Suggest therefore Parly. mission of 3 – one fr. each Party.

P.M. What of Canadian interest?

S/Doms. Unlikely tht Canada wd. wish to take over. And Newfoundlanders v. independent.

M/L &amp; P.M. What will the Mission do?

S/Doms. Some useful movements under weigh eg. in paper towns. Thought on these subjects is beginning to stir.

P.M. Let S/Doms. decide – as he wishes, so long as he makes sure they have something to do.

Agreed.

Lectures to Troops.

S/Air. Pritt banned in June. At end of &apos;42 realised it &amp; wrote to P.M. in protest &amp; now to me again about R.A.F. ban.

118

Has delivered a no. of unobjectionable lectures to R.A.F. before the ban: and I therefore asked wtr. it was nec. to maintain ban in my case. Danger of makg. him a martyr. Cdn’t we let up now?

W.O. Recommend against this.

Before man can lecture frequently to Army he as to get a cert. of employmt. &amp; that is not issued if M.I.5. prove Comm. etc. record.

But individual lectures (one at a time) can be arranged thro’ particular C.O. &amp; by that backstairs method he has crept into Army.

S/Air. ? Don’t ask him, but don’t prevent him.

H.O. V. bad record in this war - on Communist line. Not fit to lecture to troops.

W.O. Signs of Communist nibbling at Army.

Agreed: Maintain ban. Line to be taken in informing him –

“In view of his past public attitude assocn with ideas, cdnt expect to be invited to lecture to troops.”

“Anyone so prominently associated with views wh. he expd. before R. came into the war …….”
