W.M.(43)16th Meeting 25th January 1943

Air Raids.

H.O. 64 K. 247 injured. 30 p. fire Surrey Comm. Docks. Damage mostly housing.

One unfortunate feature – warning in school area after bombs had dropped.

With usual warning some lives wd. have bn. saved.

Ques. – some criticism likely.

S/Air. 1 Tuesd. 3 Wed. Ques.

Break down telephone doesn’t affect problem.

12.23 1st crossed coast : 1st bomb 12.30. Warng. 12.32. wd. have bn. 12.30 if telephone break down had not occurred. So it wd. have made no diffce.

Raises however ques. of policy. 7 mins. fr. coast to Ldn. These first for 2 yrs. in daylight save 4. If warning always given when aircraft cross coast v. larger no. warnings wd. have bn. given. Inconvenience – warng. wd. fall into contempt. On this a/c recommend adherence to policy – as expld. (including risks) by J.A. to H/C.

H.O. Agree with that view. If no other fault, will share response with S/Air for risk.

S/Air. Balloons were down in that area. Reason – they were under terminal control.

Accepted rule balloons must be down when calibration is going on. I am reviewg. that.

Reform of Foreign Service.

H.O. On salaries of Asst. U.S. of S. F.O. (£2,000). There may be repercussions on Sqs. Dpts (£1.700) – no particular reason why they shd.d be paid £300 p.a. less.

61

C.O. No distinction in Cvl. Service. You may distinguish betwn. F.O. and H.O. but not betwn. C.O. and F.O. on Attlee’s ground tht. F.O. man has to up-stake suddenly.

Agreed.

Colonial Service.

C.O. Brought to a head by Swinton’s fears of break down in W. Africa.

Discussed with Service Dpts – who agree save Admy. below.

Admy. Wish to retain Col. offrs. who don’t want to leave Navy. Small nos.

If of them he needs past. individuals we will consider favourably.

C.O. See how it works out – if exemption wrecks whole scheme I can come back.

S/Air. Hope this won’t set precedent for claims by other Dpts.

Agreed.

Jewish Refugees – Admission to Palestine.

C.O. Arrangements 4.500 children and 500 adults to come to Pal. fr. Bulgaria etc.,

Wd announce in Parlt. ordinarily. But growing trouble – suggd. to H. Comms.

We might say which 30.000 cases outstanding wd. be treated similarly i.e. 80% children. 20% doctors, Rabbis, veterans specl. cases. Say we wd. do it as pract. diffies. can be overcome.

Before F.O. see deptn Thurs. Cttee meet again. Meanwhile suspend announcement.

Agreed.

Prisoners of War : Shacking.

F.O. Difft. presentn.

Since drafted news of Canadian posn. Canadian Army and Govt. take difft. views.

62

A.C. High Commr. Canada saw me today. Telegram : Can. Army don’t now wish to reserve right to tie in battle and wish therefore to accept G. condns. Cand. Ch/Staff arrived today : I suggd. he shd. consult our mil. authies.

F.O. Re-draft was a) attempt to base ourselves on new W.O. instn.

b) G. accuse us of x/- we thought letter to deny it.

c) No point in releasg. prev. statements abt. compl. Convn. (?)

K.W. P.M. will dislike para 5.

Bruce. No hope of getting G. to agree. No point therefore in trying this longer form. Conciliatory with no prospect of success.

Adjourn decision until Canadian views examined with W.O.

Indian Commissioned Officers : Powers of Punishment.

Noted.

Red Army Day.

L.P. Procedure. Decision about ceremonies on behalf of foreign Govt. Shd. be done only on advice of F.O.

F.O. We were consulted.

S/Air. W.O. query – appropriateness of “a general salute”.

V.C.I.G.S. Suggn. about parade or march-past. Depends who takes the salute. Difficult if a Russian took it.

L.P. Intended, I think, tht. B repve. shd. take it. E.G. I shall at Edinburgh.

Agreed.

Shipping.

L.P. P.M.’s decision to divert ships fr. M/East and India. Volume already reduced by 25% : 92 p.m. were running. P.M. ruled 40/50 p.m. and C-in-C. ordered to programme to that. They took 50% basis = 46 p.m. P.M. meanwhile said 40. in Jan. there were 40 + 5 Dec. ships delayed.

Decision now requd. for February.

63

W.O. can’t yet make detailed programme on basis of 40 p.m. All they have in programme for 46 p.m. (1 fr. U.S. to M/E ) These 6 ships are in

(2 fr. U.K. “ “ ) ques. Stores can’t be

(1 “ “ “ Persia ) defined.

(1 “ “ “ India )

On other side, our imports now look even worse than at L.P. Cttee.

If these 6 go, we shall lose them for 6/8 months. – in wh. time 2/3 voyages in N. Atlantic.

Propose therefore adhere to 40 p.m. and if W.O. examn. shows tht. was too much the diffce. can be made up later. If the ships go, we can’t adjust in favour of U.K. programme.

M/W.T. 28 fr. U.S. and 12 fr. U.K. + 40 allocn.

U.S. Assistce. Jan. stops shipping into Feb,. tho’ total won’t be diminished.

L.S.A. If you sent 46 now cd. you send 6 less in March or April.

L.P. Quick return in N. Atl. wd. be lost – it is in early months of ’43 tht. important need is greatest.

V.C.I.G.S. Tho’ W.O. + mouthpiece this is view of

5% Admy. 36% Civil ) Load carried.

16% Air Bal. Army )

a) Last qur. ’42 maintce. requmts. cut by 25% to find Torch shipping. The C-in-C told these cuts wd. be restored. In fact we cut more. And cut to 40 makes it more serious.

b) C’s-in-C. asked for detailed reqmts. on 50% cut basis. They answd. : but with grave misgivings.

On return programmes 46 necessary. If now cut to 40 – we don’t know what to cut : and we have no time to refer back again. May seriously affect future opns. in Med. and Burma.

c) Send 46 more. Take up later on review of chance of 40 being enough up to June.

C. Dec. 165 ships into UK. M/E. 110 p.m. for some time past. Much of past imports into M/E. went to reserve or capital equipment.

64

Opns. in E. Med. unlikely unless we open Sic. channel. If so, pity to have sent ships on long route and locked them up. Maintain flexibility.

V.C.I.G.S. Opns. (certain) will go fwd. apart fr. openg. Sic. channel.

L.P. If decided not to send these 6. W.O. exam. programme. They cd. make out a case for adding the 6 later – at cost of ? 1 months’ delay.

V.C.I.G.S. One month might make all the diff.

C. 100.000 t. of imports are involved (for UK).

L.S.A. All turns on opening Sic. channel. This depends on M/E. Unwise to starve them.

S.Doms. Are all the 46 carrying stuff wh. is vital to the operation?

L.P. Issue is – we don’t know what we are cutting. Ques. is wthr we shd. take a risk in the dark.

C. Cable to Cairo : 6 ships are to be cut : which items shall we cut?

Q.M.G. This wd. take 10 days. We cd. do this, if we can produce the ships if they say “not poss”.

C. A propn. of this must be other than 1st priority.

M/W.T. We cd. adjust if decn. given in a week.

Meanwhile programme on basis of 40.

L.P. If you load up to 40 – you can’t put it right when the answer comes. You may have sent the wrong stuff and will need additl. shipping to carry necessaries.

S/Doms. Some illustns. given. W.O. to guess wh. are lowest priorities and adjust when replies are in.

Q.M.G. I will make arbitrary cuts and invite comments.

L.P. Leave it to them. “If shipping has to be reduced to 40, what items shd. be excluded.

Reply w’in 5 days”.

V.C.I.G.S. Do Cab. decide these cuts must be taken irrespective of effect on opns. 65

x/ I wd prefer – “this cut must be imposed : or ascertain effect of cuts. Where will you take it and any effect on opns. and if so what”.

Agreed at x/.
