W.M.(43) 87th Meeting. 21st June, 1943.

Generals Giraud and de Gaulle.

P.M. Read exchange of telegrams with President.

E. saw both y’day &amp; spoke as soldier to soldiers: G. must have effective

military control. de G. represented this as infraction of Fr. sovereignty. If

Cttee. bow to wishes of C-in-C., de G. may resign. Has talked in Press

about (a) commanding a Divn.: wd. leave open path of reconciliation:

Alternatives: (b) going to Syria, Brazzaville or S.W. Africa. That wd. be

unsatisf. - wd. stir up trouble in Syria = radio in B. etc., (c) remain in

Algeria: mil. authies wd. then have to be satisfied tht. he was not makg.

trouble in a mil. zone.

L.S.A. Agreed as regards feeling in France. de G. had bn. difficult: but largely

because he, being as exile, has had to maintain an aggressively pro-French

view.

Dropping him won’t restore U.S. prestige in France: it may ruin ours.

Hull &amp; President can’t be spoken to about him. Benes thought U.S. was

not anti de G. but rather anti-French. Don’t seem to want

U.S. Govt. have evidently lost patience. Feared d.G. wd. have majority on the enlarged Cttee of 14 - as he would have had on paper.

If he resigns &amp; make a fuss I’ll have to make a statement in Parlt. if pressed: but that will mean making the case v. de G. Greatest living barrier to re-union &amp; restoration of France: insensate ambition.

S/Doms. On other side, tho’ de G. has behaved like a fool, equal suspicion of Giraud as a re-actionary leaning twds. Pétain. Don’t pin all hopes on G. as tho’ he was v. good. Remember too that the name “de G.” stands throughout France as the spirit of resistance: the man who never gave up etc. Hopes are on the reasonable people, who may preserve the balance. U.S. views v. unreliable, they know nothg. about France.

Don’t believe him to be an enemy of this country.

President’s telegram shocked me.

A.E. The U.S. story: so exasperated v. de G. that nothg. we can say will effect them. to see the Cttee

succeed.

Wd. hope him to remain on Cttee, tho’ not dominating it.

Cttee is only sign of Fr. unity: &amp; U.S., instead of nursing it, sabotage it.

P.M. But v. dangerous to break with U.S. at this stage on such a point as this. I wdn’t. nor wd. I acquiesce in de G.’s gaining control of Fr. forces &amp; underground movemts.

222

Delusion that de G. represents Left Wing in France. His followers increasingly copy Totalitarian Fascists methods &amp; views.

S/Doms. Danger of breach betwn. Fr. in N. Africa and Fr. in Met. France.

on this.

L.P. Alternative: de G. worked in to a Cttee w’out power to step into posn of

C-in-C.

The fighting French are solid behind him: if he is dropped many of them wd. turn to the Communists.

M/L. Test is: if there were a Fr. Army behind our l of c., cd. we trust de G. to command it. Must shape our political course acc. to our decision

M/L. But present issue is – who is to be in command of the Army.

If L.P.’s alternatives were possible I’d accept it. But haven’t we moved beyond that now.

A.E. Weakness of our posn, in arguing with U.S., is that I wd. not feel happy about de G. in command of the Army.

M/P. I wd. never be happy about this.

H.O. a) Do we stand by the Cttee of Seven. Much easier: collective responsibility.

b) If you have to choose between the 2 men: experience shows tht., tho’ Giraud at first made political mistakes, he showed himself adaptable to persuasion &amp; logic &amp; influence - whereas de G. obviously isn’t.

P.M. On apptmt of Cttee of Seven we transferred to it our prev. relations with de G. Then enlarged to 14. But I rest on statement tht. we rely on the original Cttee. But his attempt to get effective control of Army = attempt to undermine or by-pass the Cttee.

We must stick to our pt. tht. our relations are with the Cttee of Seven.

Can’t acquiesce in de G’s seducing Fr. troops fr. their allegiance to Giraud. We must avoid a serious row with U.S. administration. Above all things important. Without their help &amp; good-will our power to carry on war wd. be gravely hampered.

France can only be liberated by “Anglo-American blood wh. will flow in ever broadening streams as the campaign develops.”

A.E. Fundamental point: I wdn’t mind arguing this out if I were really confident in de G. as controlling Fr Army. But I’m not. Leave him as member &amp; joint President of the Cttee, so long as he isn’t allowed charge of the Army.

223

Evatt: Cdn’t Cttee place their forces wholly under Supreme Commander. Thus avoid the issue.

P.M. Not if character etc., of Army continues to be influenced by de G., and its control used as blackmail v. Commander.

Cab. agreed: military aspect must prevail.

(if de G. prances out of Cttee, then he is a private person only.)

Await result of to-day’s mtg. of Cttee.

Russian proposal to recognise the Cttee. Suggested postponement of this because v. embarrassing if Cttee bust up soon after in consequn.

Anglo-Am. pressure.

Allied Govts. in London - Publication of Newspapers etc.

M/I. Warnings in Parlt. have had some effect.

Recent misinterpretation of P.M. speech - Poland wd. fight on tho’ Russia dropped out - after repn made Polish Govt. fired the Editor.

Action as in para. 7 approved.
