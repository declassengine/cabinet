W.M.(43) 35th Meeting. 25th February 1943

I. India, Home Member of G.Genl’s Executive Council.

L.S.A. Had prev. discussed with Viceroy apptnt. of Usman : but agree in light of recent events pref. to re-appoint Maxwell.

Only a convention tht. a man serves for 5 years.

M.A.P. Maxwell is, and regarded as, exhausted. v. unfortunate effect on opinion to extend.

Health bad.

L.S.A. Mudaliar assumed he wd. be extended.

M.A.P. He wd. be apptd. for term of yrs. and wd. be regarded as shutting out Indianisation.

A.E. Say we agree in principle : but is Viceroy satisfied he is mentally and

x ( physically alert enough for the job.

(

L.P. ( Don’t commit yrself to a year’s extension – because of new Viceroy.

Agreed as at x/.

Ghandi.

L.S.A. An up-grade. 15 days out of 21 now passed. Ends next Tues. evening.

II. R.A.F. Squadrons in N. Russia.

A.E. R. originally agreed – staff 4/500. Air Miny. then found larger nos. reqd.. R made diffies. I saw Maisky who promised help. Reply now recd. is impertinent.

Show-down necessary. See me tomorrow. Admy to give the statement of losses up to date in convoy.

A.V.A. This is already available. No use handg. over because sea work in wh. R have no experience : also co-opn. Admy : intelligence : language diffies. End my upcatg. request and say tht. if facil. not given we must review all convoy plans.

Trouble prs. on U.S. Will see their repve/ first. Not quite sure, however, what their attitude will be.

99

M.A.P. Is Russian reply impertinent?

S/Air. They can’t pretend to understand these methods. They must realise this.

A.V.A. We want a) closest trained co-opn.

b) ground personnel for use of latest techn. aids.

Ques wthr. under these circss we can go on running the convoys at all.

Our ships, our sailors are involved.

H.O. Is it not part of R. anti-foreign suspicions.

Agreed F.O. proposals.

III Civil Air Transport.

M/L. Better to go out for bolder plan. vis.á.vis U.S.A.

S/Air. Part of our plan is to design new types : but it will take at least 4 years.

Meanwhile, we will use available resources.

We must design for ultimate fleet. The biggest will take up to 5 yrs. to produce.

Can’t hope to advance them dates. But meanwhile jig &amp; tool to get most out of types wh. cd. be. adapted to get them into use meanwhile.

Para 2(i) 6/8 enquired for Atlantic traffic. V. high load. 70/100 passengers.

(ii) Not yet started.

(iii) Great deal of work done by more than one firm : not yet operationally practicable.

Interim types. Jig &amp; tool for addl. York. and transport version of Shetland and Halifax.

This will enable us to maintain services with reasonably serviceable craft, tho’ not comparable to U.S. types.

York = Lancaster with fuselage adapted for civil transport.

Shetland = larger Sunderland : Clipper.

H.O. How does this fit in with post-war policy.

100

S/Air. Trying to avoid collision with U.S. interests. Shall discuss with Doms and U.S. But first want authy. fr. W. Cab. to say we mean to have effective air transport organiasn. We will not accept solution on basis tht. we won’t build any aircraft : and we therefore want authy. to plan some prodn.

M.A.P. To get interest of industry we must take responsibility for design and ordering of ¾ useful interim types.

M./P. Paras. 7 &amp; 8. “Minimum etc.” Unless R.A.F. will use for operational purposes aircraft constructed with view to civil use ….

a) Employment of labour in the industry.

b) Imperial uses for civil aviation.

This memo. contemplates only about 300 aircraft.

M.A.P. No. Para 8. says minimum no. of types.

M/P. Thought we wd. order about 2.000 : for use partly for R.A.F. This wd. give you real bargaining power.

S/Air. Wd it? U.S. cd. build 20.000, &amp; much earlier.

L.S.A. Must F.O. know about nos? Isn’t it enough to show tht. we’ll have enough to withstand U.S. competition in our spheres.

S/Doms. All tht. is requd. now is authy. to M.A.P. to go on with specified types.

M.A.P. Yes : except tht. we can only get industry together on basis tht. when designing etc. done we shall order. We must indicate tht. we shall go beyond proto-types : tht. we shall guarantee an order of reasonable size. Otherwise individ. firms may go off on their own.

K.W. Don’t commit ourselves now to para. 9 point.

M/P. Ultimately are you thinking beyond minimum nos. – i.e. about 400.

Unless we make a bigger effort we’ll be left behind.

S/Air. Never had figure of 400 in my mind : “minimum” refers only to types.

M.A.P. Enough to say will organise civil aviation on basis of these types and you’ll order enough of them to base civil aviation on them.

101

M/P. Transport aircraft for Services must be fitted in, so that it can sustain the civil aviation manufacturer.

M.A.P. Agreed. Cd. arrange that.

A.E. a) I don’t want to go so far as Memo. reopen discussions.

Want merely background. Amend para.

b) Wdn’t mention nos. We’re going on with our programme : later on

wd. like talks : meanwhile am talkg. with Doms.

M/P. Suggd. words at end of para 8.

K.W. Content tht. discussions shd. begin on that basis : but no firm commitment at this stage until proposals brought back to Cab as in para 5. You can make it clear tht. this is p. objective.

C.O. Para 2(v). Internal use in Colonies. We’ve had no opportunity to consider. May be need for addl. smaller type. Caveat.

S/Doms. Talks with Doms. Their internal requirements. difft. fr. ours. And they may want to manufacture for own needs. Caveat.

S/Air. ? Keep them off that now. Types will turn on routes we’re going to work.

We don’t yet know them. Premature to discuss types with Doms. now.

S/Doms. Doms. may be our biggest customers to keep our industry empld.

M.A.P. We shall need these types : and we can produce more for Doms. if wanted. If they want others, we shall consider wthr. we can fit them in. Meanwhile we can get on.
