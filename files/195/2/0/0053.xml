W.M.(43) 58th Meeting 22nd April, 1943

I. Post-War Commercial Policy.

K.W. Cttee of Ministers: general agreement reached.

Need to carry Doms. with us - Hal to avoid, if possible, opening it with U.S. Govt. until we had consult ns with Doms, save for one contingency (Food Confce) wh. now looks unlikely. Procedure: consultns with experts from Doms.

S/Doms. Australia &amp; N.Z. built up one on tariffs &amp; other on state trading. Important therefore to get the experts over &amp; see they understand the whole picture. This method had worked well in past. No ques yet of agreement betwn. Dom. Govts.

Draft telegrams approved: subject to L.S.A. amendment.

II. U-Boat Warfare.

P.M. Annoyed tht. Senate Cttee shd. have published losses figures w’out consultns with us.

A v. embarrassing period to have quoted.

Harriman is complaining to Hopkins. F.O. shd. make a more formal complaint.

President may then warn Senate tht. if they behave thus they won’t be given figures.

III. Japanese Execution of U.S. Airmen who bombed Tokio.

P.M. Will send message sympathy with U.S. over killing of U.S. airmen by Japs. Take the opp. of indicatg. our men looking fwd. to joining in punishing these Japs.

IV. Food Conference.

L.P. Short notice. Delegates may have to leave next week.

Shortages: therefore co-ordinated purchase &amp; distribution. But disc n. of broad economic ques e.g. stabilisation can’t be dealt with by Food Conference. No commitment at all at this Conference on particular commodities e.g. cotton.

Questions for decision on p.11. Only serious one for War Cab = No(2).

M/F. Increasing conc n. of world shortage of food after war. Need therefore for organisation to deal with that situation a) betwn. us &amp; U.S. b) with allied Govts. Useful results if we can at this Conf. persuade producers to

174

increase their prodn. On (2) all we need is to state principle (wh. is obvious) while avoiding detail both on commodity &amp; quantity.

K.W. P.M. &amp; President agreed no public statement need be made on this.

A.E. This time it is not, as before, rationing to feed others: it is rationing as necessity for us too.

L.P. Danger: if shortage, &amp; we give not assurance of co-oper n. to assure supplies, there will be scramble &amp; market will go.

M/F. Face realities. These countries are already trying to buy food - e.g. Norway are trying to buy meat in Argentine. Buying for the future: forcing up prices.

Cherwell. Believe fears of shortages are exaggerated. There will be plenty of wheat.

Shortage of meat &amp; fats. Diffy. about shipping &amp; paying.

If you agree to co-ordinated purchase etc., under (1) you needn’t add an explicit reference to rationing.

P.M. Mistake for us to take the lead in self-sacrifice. This is God’s role for God’s own country – the fountain of food. If they take the lead, we can say we’ll not be behindhand in generosity to the starving peoples of Europe.

L.P. Then we can tell our delegates to agree with (2) if U.S. offer it first.

S/Doms. Mistaken to think we can rely on Doms. Need to stop rocketing prices.

K.W. O.K. for delegates to join in with offer in P.M.’s terms if U.S. offer it first.

Agreed: redraft in these terms.

M/L. Rationing for home consumption essential to get the export trade going again quickly. (i.e. commodities other than food).

People will be better disciplined after the war if control is maintained but relaxed.

Freeing of all controls rapidly wd. produce chaos.

L.P. Delegates R. Law only Minister. Some senior officials.

P.M. Agree (1). Redraft on (2) to be submitted to P.M. Agree (3).

Genl. line to take “we’ll accept anything wh. U.S. will impose on themselves”. 175
