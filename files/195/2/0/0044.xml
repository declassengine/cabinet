W.M.(43) 48th Meeting. 5th April, 1943.

de Gaulle &amp; Giraud.

P.M. Saw de G. &amp; Masigli Frid. Humble and tame. Told him to await AE.’s return &amp; my enquiry wtr. Eisenhower cd. receive him. E. has replied tht. while didn’t wnt a breach with de G. wd. prefer him to wait till crisis of battle passed. Asked F.O. to put that to him.

Cadogan. Passed to Massigli y’day: no reply.

P.M. Announced in Press he wdn’t be going for a while.

Personal Injuries (Civilian) Scheme.

L.P. No diffy. in acceptg equality between men &amp; women.

More diffy. about g. occupied &amp; non g. occupied. But found in practice tht. this wd. be mainly housewives (about wh. no Ty. objn) &amp; o.a. pensioners. Repercussions: T.U.C. consulted &amp; no real ground for apprehension.

P.M. Will this be retrospective?

L.P. New rates will be paid to old cases.

K.W. Before Sub. Cttee apptd. L.P. Cttee decided no action. But tho’. pressure, Sd. Cttee apptd. The recommns. surprised us – qua non gainfully occupied persons. My anxiety is in future the g. occupied demand a higher rate for themselves. How long cd. we hold the position then. On the other hand, admit tht. T.U.C. have promised no risk of repercussions – tho’ don’t know how long it will last.

P.M. The compensation shd. relate to the injury, not the earnings.

M/L Explained history of previous relation to earnings. Present decision involves going over to P.M.’s basis. And T.U.C. have agreed to accept that. If they go back on their bargain, we must fight that issue.

P.M. Defend it on basis of war injury. State endeavours to protect all its citizens alike - &amp; now will compensate them on this basis.

Agreed.

138

Tube Shelter Enquiry.

H.O. Two aspects - physical &amp; psychological. The more we stress the second, the greater the security risk. We have therefore altered Mr. Dunne’s language: but he agrees fair picture of all that mustn’t be withheld on security grounds

Agreed to publish findings so far as security allowed.

K.W. P.6 shows this situation was envisaged.

H.O. I can’t use this Rpt. to protect Govt.

P.M. Against giving such limelight to this incident.

Flaunting weakest feature. What notice taken of all who died in air attack.

Disproportionate importance - meat &amp; drink to enemy &amp; invitation to repeat.

Say Rpt. received &amp; considered: no need to publish: all its lessons are being vigorously applied.

Why publish - Govt.’s position is unassailable.

Moreover we said earlier “no panic”: this makes it clear there was panic &amp; it was part cause: &amp; this we are with-holding.

H.O. 170 people killed: shook the public: had to hold enquiry: agitation v. its being private: resisted tht., saying Rpt. wd. be published: will be told now that we’ve something to hide.

M/Inf. Short statement in H/C = publication.

H.O. We held off the discontented locals by promise to publish results.

P.M. But you are concealing the truth – panic.

M.A.P. Say {measures suggested in course of enquiry

{defects disclosed &amp; these are being remedied.

S/Doms. Make it clear that panic was not due to Jews and/or Fascists.

H.O. undertook to consider.

Church Bells. 139

W.O. Ques. to-morrow by Stokes.

Since announcement about Reg. Areas, our posn weaker.

C-in-C. Home Forces thinks bell system cd. be limited to Reg. Areas.

Shall I therefore indicate tht. I will reconsider in relation to Reg. Areas.

K.W. Leave it alone.

P.M. Don’t make any concession on enquiry by Stokes. If any concession, announce otherwise than to Stokes, e.g. to Greenwood.

K.W. Don’t hold out any hopes unless you have decided to change.
