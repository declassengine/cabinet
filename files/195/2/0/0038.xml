W.M.(43) 41st Meeting. 16th March, 1943

I. Portuguese East Africa.

Law. F.O. anxious not to set up S.O.E. organn there at this stage.

M.E.W. Want this to proceed. Smuts v. Keen: worried about Axis activities: wd. take them months before they cd. do anything - &amp; wd. do nil w’out F.O. sanction. Risk tht. if we don’t go on with this Smuts may set up one of his own.

We have no doubt there is Axis activity there: &amp; no machinery for co-ordinated action to study it. No overt action w’out sanction of B. &amp; S.A. Govt.

A.V.A. S.O.E. going there might queer pitch for existg. S.I.S. people there.

Fr. Admy. pt. of view main risk comes fr. Axis agents in Union.

M.E.W. Smuts wd. use S.O.E. for that purpose.

Law. Assurances to Salazar tht. we wd. have no S.O.E. in Portugal.

M.E.W. There they were trying to build up anti. Axis activity.

P.M. F.O. Admy. &amp; S.I.S. all greed – v. serious matter to go against their united view.

S/Doms. Undesirable to go on with this now, in view of progress made &amp; relations with Portugal.

Law. Smuts request was based wholly on sub. menace: and that ques has bn. cleared up.

M.E.W. S.O.E. can’t produce results until they have bn. planted a long time.

A.V.A. Most urgent need is to control use of no less by Axis agents in S. Africa.

PM. As a) this route likely to become less important.

b) no danger of invasion of Portugal.

c) views of F.O. S.I.S. &amp; Admy.

120

it wd. be mistake to do this now. Agreed.

II. Appointment of Govt. Directors to Companies on War Production.

P.M. How necessary is this to M.A.P.?

M.A.P. Obviates need to appoint controller – who are becoming increasingly diff. to find.

Havg. this power, it wd. be easier to make voly arrangements.

Diff. to run a co. thro’ a controller. Have appovd only 2 up to date.

P.M. Consid. recent improvemt. in prodn. Is it worth a Parly row to have a new power for a few cases? Opportunity for antagonisms to Minister.

M.A.P. Some are v. big concerns. Present diffy. is with the Bristol Company. It wd. be v. diff. to put a controller into that company.

P.M. Reg. in new form is much easier to defend: &amp; is entirely reasonable.

L.P. Remember tht. a Reg. has bn. made - ques now is of amending it.

Ch. Whip. Diffy. in House = general uneasiness about D Regs.: many will join in on basis of opposn to legn by regulation.

L.P. You can’t make that general posn easier by running away on particular cases.

K.W. New form may mitigate some of the opposn.

M/P. Think it will upset the industry.

M.A.P. I don’t.

P.M. Is the advantage worth the antagonism this may well provoke.

M/L. That overlooks the fact that we have made a Regn. We can’t afford to withdraw that &amp; substitute nothing. That course wd. provoke much stronger reactions from Labour.

P.M. Think it was a mistake to make the original Regn Was it necessary?

L.P. No new principle tht. Govt. directors shd. go on the Board if substantial Govt. investment.

121

K.W. Wd. be politically bad to withdraw.

P.M. V. well: go on &amp; have your row: it may hamper M.A.P. in future work.

M/P. Adminve pledges – e.g. point of view of firms will be heard by Crown Cttee.

This may help.
