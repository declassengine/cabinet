W.M.(42) 171st Meeting 21st December 1942

A.E. Russia.

{G. plan for spring – persist in Caucasus poss. embodied with (advance thro’ Turkey.

{Maisky’s informn. defensive in Italy and Balkans : tho’ some support to {N. Africa.

Rome – Open City

A.E. Approach by Card. S/S to our Min. at Vatican. Condns. on wh. we might refrain fr. bombg. Rome.

5m. messages fr. C. Hinsley to P.M.

Draft telegram settg. out our 4 condns. C.O.S. have addns. to suggest.

Halifax appd. Hull – not encouraging response – they might regd. it as ultimatum and we don’t want to bomb R. anyway. We don’t agree tht. it is ultimatum.

Telegram fr. Rome (4688. Berne) giving Card. S/S latest views : saying M = 16 staffs were leaving Rome. They are getting out before they’ve had our conditions.

P.M. Nothg. much in R. worth bombing.

C.I.G.S. Yes Rlway.

C.A.S. Not thro’ centre of city : but v. vulnerable marshalling yards just outside.

P.M. Not concluded on this : but no harm in playing game with them. V. damming to their morale if they bolt.

They raised this – we aren’t committing ourselves, either to bomb or not to bomb R. It wd. be a v. important decision – when it came to decisions. For W. Cab.

Invited views of colleagues.

Personally, thought worth promising if all our conditions fulfilled.

M.A.P. If they agreed to condns. p. opinion wd. be v. much against our bombing R.

27

S/Doms. No need to promise perhaps – say we bomb only places of mil. importance if you make it otherwise then we shall take a/c of that in deciding what targets we bomb. Don ‘t like arguing or agreeing with Axis Govt.

W.O. Nodal points of rlways tho’ they are on outskirts, are so near you cdn’t bomb them without risk of hitting City.

M.A.P. Deal with Pope : not Ital. Govt.

P.M. Shd. we add to our condns one tht. no use of rlway thro’ Rome (as defined 3 miles fr. Palazzo Veneza) for military traffic.

Some feeling tht. this wd. be regarded as impossible condn. wd. minimise chance of their agreeing.

M/P. wd. make it impossible for them to agree.

C.A.S. Why not keep this back for the moment – under cover of a genl. phrase “no part of the area to be used as base or channel for mil. operations”.

Agreed.

Jibuti.

A.E. Telegram. Leave this to Platt.

P.M. de G’s posn. affected by rise and consolidn. of Darlan &amp; Giraud.

D. is delivering the goods : impressing U.S. who will come to think more of him than of any others.

Giraud’s demand to be put i/c : Eisenhower will give him etwas.

Developmnt. of Fr. Army in N. Africa. A force will be growing up there wh. will be stronger force than anything de G. can show. If D. faded out &amp; G. faded in, de G’s posn. wd. be v. much overshadowed. Bad for de G. unless he united himself with G.

In the common interest tht. de G. shd. come closer together with D. &amp; G. If he doesn’t deal with D. he will cut much less ice later if D. goes and he has to deal with G.

A.E. U.S. gettg. into posn. – we keep D. but want honest Frenchmen in the adminn. But the 2 things are inconsistent.

P.M. de G. is missing his market.

28

A.E. But he will never make a deal with Darlan.

P.M. Supposing Fr. in N. Africa get 250.000 troops – they will surely represent France outside Met. country.

Risk of U.S. thinking of “our Darlan &amp; their de Gaulle”.

Appointment of B. &amp; U.S. representatives to Eisenhower’s staff.

P.M. F.O. think our man shd. be “Ambassador” to Eisenhower, not on his staff.

President retorted both to be equal and similar. Doubt if U.S. will agree to our man being difft. fr. theirs.

President has today announced tht. Murphy, with rank of Minister, has been apprd.

They mean therefore diplomatic Minister. We had in mind political Minister.

We had thought “with but not under”. F.D.R. means “under”.

A.E. V. awkward to put a Junior Minister in this position.

If F.D.R. insists we shall have to send a Minister in the diplomatic sense.

Spain.

A.E. Rodriguez Vega recently encouraged by S.O.E. to leave Spain is now in Lisbon.

Associate of Negrin, who has asked tht. he may come here en route from Mexico.

I wd. prefer not – Negrin, who came here en route for Mexico, is still here.

S/Doms. I wd. be satisfied if we facilitated his leaving Lisbon – for Mexico.

Agreed : facilitate journey to Mexico &amp; so inform Citrine.

Prisoners of War.

A.E. Any decision now?

P.M. Wait – see wthr. they unchain for Xmas and wthr. they resume thereafter.

29

Extra Territoriality in China – Kowloon.

P.M. Stick to principle tht,. all territorial changes are reserved for Peace Conference. As with Russia.

Say therefore “This has nothg. to do with the Treaty : No questions of territory can be discussed in advance of Peace Confce.”

O.S. Hong-Kong has spilled over into the leased territory. E.G. water supply. airfield and part of docks.

M.A.P. This is leased – can’t use term “territorial changes”.

O.S. Nervous about first sentence in para. 5.

L.S.A. Bring in reference to our lease of bases to U.S.A.

A.E. Avoid phrase wh. brings in Hong Kong.

M.A.P. “If Chinese desires discussion of terms of lease of these territories, this can be discussed at Peace Conf.”

Agreed.

Posthumous Honours Awards.

P.M. Service Ministers’ views?

W.O. Cttee say tht. scheme will cause more heartburning that it will cure.

That is my view. S/Air &amp; First Lord agreed.

L.P. Real diffy. is that you can’t do it for W.S.O. And that being so, it’s v. difficult to do it for decorations.

M/L. Better to leave majority of wives and parents under impression tht. death was in heroic circs, than give a token award in 2% - 5% of cases.

Requisitioning of Accommodation.

Note taken of W.P.(42)589.
