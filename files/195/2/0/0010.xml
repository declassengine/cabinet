W.M.(42) 172nd Meeting 23rd December 1942

I. Invasion of U.K. – 1943.

P.M. Document adopted.

H.O. (Minute to P.M.) wants definition of redns. possible on assumptions of raids, not invasion.

H.O. Need for guarding key-points.

C.I.G.S. We are examining this – Cttee under Vice-Chiefs – will take a/c of raids by para-troops.

II. Civil Administration &amp; Security in French N.W. Africa.

H.O. Three causes of concern - a) must be many unreliable people there, who cd. act as agents or cd. stir up trouble. Are the security arrangements adequate? No. Strengthen it (i) on merits (ii) to relieve E.

b) civil adminn. if adaptable to needs of war, shd. be. stiffened with some more competent people.

c) B. subsidiary to U.S. Shd. we not be in a stronger posn. because we are experienced and competent in these matters.

And of. C.O. point about B. prestige in this area.

A.E. We don’t want U.S. to think we are nagging them on this.

P.W. done by our people and censorship is to be done.

Send Mack a summary of what’s going on, and couple it with an offer to E. to send [2 or 3] experienced men on the security side.

L.P. A security executive is no good except to bind together competent Dpts.

W.O. You won’t get efficient adminn. in an unsound political condition.

P.M. Don’t see what can be done?

H.O. Fairly high level discussion with U.S. Puttg. one or two people in isn’t enough.

31

S/Air. R.A.F. much concerned.

A.V.A. Suggest thro’ Mack executive with U.S. Chairman. B. Deputy.

L.P. Trouble is French. Genl. Patten has said he doesn’t regard Morocco as occupied territory.

C.I.G.S. C. thinks posn. not too bad. But anything we can do to tighten up wd. be helpful. But won’t get at root of matter until Nogués goes.

P.M. We shan’t be able to run this in detail, from here.

M.A.P. Cd. we not offer thro’ Mack a man who has experience of security in this type of area.

P.M. Difficulties of joint undertaking – friction already betwn. E. Anderson. Make allowance for fact that we’ve only bn. there 6 wks. We haven’t taken over civil adminn. and cdn’t.

M/L. Best to try to win our way thro’. Ask for more when we have proved success of what we have sent already – eg. Mack, censorship then onwards by degrees.

Confidence thro’ achievement.

A.E. Yes – by my suggd. approach thro’ Mack.

P.M. These points wd. be w’in scope of 2 Ministers suggd. by F.D.R. – one B. and one U.S.

Read exchange of telegrams with F.D.R. about status of our repve. : formula finally suggested was “H.M.G’s pol. repve. at Genl. Eisenhower’s H.Q.” So tht. he wd. not be “on the staff” of E. He must have right of direct communication with H.M.G. tho’ his activities wd. be subject of course to over riding veto by C-in-C. if necessary on military grounds.

Macmillan – shd. be lent by C.O. and not replaced for a time anyhow.

C.O. Agreed – on a temporary basis. Will try and carry on alone : if I can come to you when I find it impossible.

M/P. Security is a mil. matter. Our offer shd. be on mil. not civil, side.

P.M. If M. is accepted and goes out he can bring out all these points – even incldg. the ques of mil. security if he gets on good enough terms.

32

We (ie U.S.) must make the French run the show. The U.S. can’t do it themselves.

Better do this not thro’ Mack. but thro’ Macmillan when he arrives.

H.O. Agree this is the best beginning : but I hope my suggns. will then be followed up by M.

A.E. Wd. like to send a F.O. man out with M.

P.M. Let him go alone in first instance. Later relented. Talk to M.

III. American Influence in West Africa.

P.M. Thought Cab. shd. see tho’ don’t know we cd. do.

M/P. From economic pt. of view we have bn. v. well treated. So long as we stand where we do we shall have no cause for complaint.

C.I.G.S. Request for us to appt. 2 (naval and air) on Adml. Glassford’s Mission to Dakar.

This is encouraging.

P.M. Brazzaville Radio – will be cause of complaint to us – continued violent anti Darlan campaign. U.S. will soon say trouble being caused by de Gaullist faction.

M/State Also fr. F. French in Syria.

C.D. All we suggest in this memo is apptmnt. of American to Swinton’s staff.

Also 3 pts. at end of memo. to be taken up thro’ this man if apptd. or thro’ dipl. channel. First of these is v. important.

M/State. Much of this due to Pan. American Airways – employees.

P.M. I wd. mention this to Hopkins.

A.E. Cd. be done by Halifax.

IV. North Africa – Report by Duncan Sandys.

D.S. Only there 2 days : and only at H.Q. Impressions based on that.

33

a) Greater part of senior offrs’ time (B. &amp; U.S.) was taken up with problems of F. politics. E. talked of little else : and spent ¾ of his time on it.

This will prejudice posn. of the troops.

X/ E. wants to be relieved of this. But meanwhile feels he must deal with these ques. himself – a major mil. interest. Ability to take Tunis quickly depends wholly on F. co-opn. and good will.

b) Pro Axis Mayors and Prefects. Anxiety about sabotage of rlway. Mountainous country : rlway cd. be put out of action.

c) Agents. Large Italian populn. Army H.Q. located and bombed – presumably because enemy has good intelligence.

d) Darlan is doing all he’s told up to limits of his power : but this is limited. Cdn’t dismiss all the unreliable men in the adminn.

e) If this attempt on Tunis fails, we’ll have diffy. with Axis sympathisers jobbing back. Unsympathetic if not worse. Situation may then pass beyond D’s control. D. wd. have to be induced to withdraw in favour of Giraud. D. wd. have to appoint G.

f) If we take Tunis quite soon no urgent need for a change. But even so change in favour of G. before v. long wd. be good thing.

Military Situation. 8th Army. wh. I had just left. were far more assured than 1st Army. No one put our chances in Tunis higher than 6:4.

B. troops have fought well. Only criticism is tht. they rushed too fast into final attack.

Anderson’s concern is about tanks. U.S. have best faults, with less experience, and our more experienced men have less valuable tanks.

U.S. troops disappointing. V. green and untrained. Tactical handling of troops and weapons is unsatisfactory.

One particular incident : U.S. combat group wh. ran out. Commander under arrest.

Air Situation. Our M/E. commanders not satisfied with way in wh. combined air force are being used. E. wants Tedder to take charge.

34

System of Allied Command not easy to work. U.S. not used to havg. troops under B. command and tend to issue orders to their men who are under B. command.

Strong desire, however, to work together. As time goes on, solutions will be found.

In reply to Questions –

Air. U.S. nervous of anything wh. might separate air forces fr. Army.

Wd. feel anxious about Tedder on that score.

M/State. Shall I, while in Washington, explain how my machine works w. ref to X/.

D.S. Murphy doesn’t take the load off E. because he hasn’t the status.

P.M. Friction between Anderson and Americans?

D.S. A. is not personality to get on well with back-slapping Americans. Nothg. more than that. But if impendg. action not successful, likely to be recriminations.

C.A.S. Plan. Tedder to have advance H.Q. with E. to control Libya and Malta based bombers.

( Army co-opn. Command under U.S.

( Strategic bombing force “ “

( G.R.A.C. and defence of ports “ B. offr.

Tedder to have joint Anglo-Am. staff for priority of supplies etc.

E. provoked to put this suggn. up to Combined C.O.S. or to both C.O.S. separately.

V. Russian Convoys.

P.M. Have asked Admy. to consider 2 in Jan.

A.E. We want a decision on this quickly - ? to-morrow.

A.V.A. We wish to communicate with C-in-C. who is at sea.

A.E. Want decn. before Xmas if the stuff is to be loaded. in time.

P.M. The ½ convoy 17/1 is settled

35

The only doubt is that due to start 25/1

Surely the ½ convoy, firm decision will give you enough to go on for loading.

Cab. view is we do everything possible. Admy. must say wthr. possible.

1st S.Ld. By 25/1. much daylight : narrow channel : we can’t then send cruisers : we shall therefore need 15 U.S. destroyers. My idea is to get the destroyers and run them in ½.

All Naval losses in Torch have fallen on us.

Agreed : assume, for loading, tht. convoy will sail.

VI. Jews.

F.O. Saw depn. today : v. anxious for us to find places for those who can get out via Bulgaria or Portugal.

C.O. H.O. F.O. Cttee to consider and report.

VII. Bombing of Marseilles.

A.V.A. Any political objns. to bombing ships in Marseilles harbour fr. a. carrier?

P.M. They are being made ready for handg. over to Axis.

F.O. No objn.

P.M. Let them go in, then, so long as E. don’t object, and sink these ships.
