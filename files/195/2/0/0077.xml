W.M.(43) 95th Meeting. 8th July, 1943.

War Pensions. Revision of Royal Warrant.

P.M. Cost?

L.P. Can’t be estimated.

P.M. Is it enough?

L.P. V. substantial.

II.

A.G. After L.P. Cttee conclusion M/P. &amp; I saw interested Members. Broadly they were content.

a) They stressed most the point that existing Warrant puts onus on man.

b) Man shd. be entitled to benefit eg. reasonable doubt.

c) Cd. “one-up” be given to man discharged with a complaint wh. he hadn’t got when he went in, accordg. to records.

*Amend para. 5 as shown in ms. Adopt the position form. Agreed.

Omission of “directly” (attributable) will help – in (a)(i)

.. .. “to a material extent” .. .. – in (a)(ii).

Repudiation of onus in (2). Shows duty on Govt. to go into the case.

Also benefit of reasonable doubt - also will help.

P.M. Is there much between this and “Fit for Service, Fit for Pension.”

M/P/ Yes –vast diffce in fact (eg v.d.) and in principle.

Also diffy of claims made 15/20 years after end of war.

Of 600.000 drawing pensions now all but v. few are working.

*M.A.P. This amendment by A.G. will mean that M/P. has no discretion to refuse a pension. Definition by exclusion at present.

A.V.A. Make it clear that this applies only to

x{service under war-time conditions}x

{persons entered for war service. }

A.E. Will this meet legitimate demands - because we can’t retreat from position we take up now. We must stand &amp; fight on present decisions.

L.P. * If it has to be met, try formula pencilled in my copy.

243

P.M. Better use the original words, if you can’t use the AG.’s formula. The amendment is a wobbly alternative.

Agreed: Stand as in print unless AG.’s amendment can stand.

Later: “Provided” in lieu of “if”.

III.

P/M. In this war rates raised twice on a/c rise in cost/living.

But anomalies by comparison with men on 1919 rates.

Proposals here met old claims of B. Legion. But later on they will press for increase rates for last-war cases.

I want to say tht. we put these pensions on same level as old war: &amp; tht. if c/living rises both classes will be increased.

L.P. Say nothing about rise to match rise of c/living.

IV.

After much talk - passed w’out amendment.

P.M. Cost?

K.W. 2 3/4 m. p.a. at once. 16-18 1/2m. p.a. if casualties equal to /half of last war.

{ Proper for war-pensioners. Wdn’t follow, however, tht. consequential

{ improvements wd. follow e.g. in Service pay &amp; conditions. This was

{ accepted.

VII. Post-Injury Marriages.

P.M. Danger of abuse. Post-injury marriage shd. not be accepted in principle.

Pearce.

H.O. Anxiety re repercussions on W. Compn - where many men are unemployable because of their accident.

P.M. Dangerous to give any man the right to confer pension rates on woman willing to marry him.

M/P. We have narrowed the field w’in which abuse may arise.

Agreed: Fight on this.

VIII.

244

A.V.A. Commodore’s widows. i.e. Flag Offrs. returning from retirement to act as Commodores of Convoys. (e.g. Lady Brownrigg will come down from £1450 to £290.)

13 Admirals have died at sea in these circumstances.

Specially difficult because no gratuity as there wd. be for death in action.

M/P. Other ranks get no such gratuity.

Agreed: Admy. shd. clear this up with Ty -

[preferably before the Debate.]

{ and if necessary submit to Ty.

IX. Parent’s Pensions.

Approved.

XII. Alternative Pensions. Abolished 1924. B.Legion want it restored.

Recommendations approved.

War Pensions - Appeals Tribunals Bill.

A.G. Right of appeal now a) v. refusal to grant.

b) v. final assessment.

But no right of appeal against interim awards.

I think this v. diff. to resist. Agree tht. final award shd. not be hastened.

But decision tht. he is 40% will affect him for years until final assessment is made. M/P. says kept under constant review.

Members: v. well have time limit: can only appeal again after a certain time &amp; on evtt of deterioration of condn.

They will divide v. this &amp; I sympathise with them.

L.P. How can Appeal Tribunal keep pace with “continuous review”.

P.M. This means transferring the adminion from Minister to Tribunal.

L.P. Also everyone wd. have a shot at it &amp; Tribunals wd. be overloaded.

P.M. ? Right to appeal after 2/3 years or v. final assessment.

A.G. They might be content with 2 years.

Agreed: M/P. to consider that &amp; re-submit to W.Cab.

245

Appeals against Discretionary Decisions.

A.G. Get amendments to Bill down early.

Conference - both sides of House, after publn of White Paper.

A.E. War Cab. Minister shd. help in these Debates.

P.M. To settle with Leader of House

who it shd. be.

Leakage to Press.

A.E. Demobilisation - Education - Pensions - C. Service Man Power.

M/L. Article on demobilisation cdn’t have bn. written save by someone with knowledge of memo.

Same is true of the Education leak. - and the H.O. leak.

P.M. (b) Strengthen &amp; bring up to date the note of April 1942.

(a) Investigation by S/Doms. L.P.S. and A.G.
