Communiqué embodying t. of r. of Joint Body. Read main items.

Important item: avoidance of conflict in reconstn of the

2 countries.

Better than mil. alliance. Will produce some standardisation which

foodstuffs etc., from France. Will affect C.O.

to us. of low-interest rates. Argentine have bn. reluctant

balances. Have suggd we take only ½ % fr. French.

H.M. a) standardisation won’t slow down our reconstn?

A.B. This (b) is in hand. L.C.C. will look after (b) as p.a. authy not giving , only case on p.a. basis.

321

F.A.N. (b) will be gt. relief to Police. If squatters won’t go there, are Police

they can remove them (to rest centre, not Police station)?

H.M. Forcible removal to poor law institn wd. be awkward.

F.A.N. Wdn’t take them so far.

(a) Announce Ct’s decision.

after High Ct. decision.

F.A.N. Need for clear directions to Police. Can’t exercise a discretion.

The bottle of milk for the baby can be handed in by someone else.

H.S. May be some exceptional cases.

New entries – absolute bar. Re-entry – as little discretion as possible.

A.B. No re-entry: tho’ in v. except. cases of domestic hardship it might be

the squatters w’out force.

G.T. Need to avoid enlisting public sympathy for squatters. Also to winkle

Point raised in Minute to P.M. Cd. we take the line tht. we want to

by industrial disturbance.

A.B. Believe Comm. Party is divided – this is only London Branch.

A.B. London housing. 750.000 = target for U.K. = separate home for each

But that won’t give uniformity all over - &amp; Ldn, in particular,

decentralisation. There is therefore some basis for Ldn. action. 322

Propose therefore (i) W.O. &amp; Air Miny to consider wtr. they can

(ii) Hotels being de-requisitioned. Cdn’t they be used for

Holborn e.g. asking for 2 such bldgs. V. diff to go on resisting

R.S.C. Need for hotels –

(b) must let buyers come to Ldn.

Once you start, all l.a.’s will want hotels for all sorts of purposes.

G.T. Cab. decision on priorities. Read extracts.

13 hotels in Ldn. in care of M/W. used for refugees, builders –

On (i) I’ve bn. pressing Service Dpts. to do this for some time. Much

de-requisitioning at 10 p. day.

(a) hotel accommn v. short.

(c) Tourist traffic for ’47.

H.D. Support RSC. re hotels. But Serv. Dpts. are not fast enough – W.O. &amp; Admy are not doing as well as Air Miny. Latter have

hotel use w’out delay.

P.M. Let them open at once, even in part.

E.B. Low priority for release of luxury flats has caused pressure on lower-

Cd. P.M. do a Battle of Accommodation drive on this? 4-mile radius

reduced 75% accomm. in relation to redn of staff. The other 2

Ministers closely concerned in last war.

History &amp; commentary for informn of Cabinet.

Concurrently, enquiry into common services. N.’s rpts. not examd yet.

Wdn’t embody our conclns on that issue in this W. Paper. Main proposal here = M/Def. with scope excludg. pro tem. those

Defence Cttee vice

common services. C.I.D. (wrongly named &amp; advisory). Its Cttees

Co-ordination a) of cutting edge: via

Continue practice of Defence debate – defence as a whole - &amp; all

Cab. and P.M.

Estimates to be in unified picture.

Bottled experience vice theory.

Some amendmts. to W. Paper will be needed. First, however, points of

H.M. Two ques’s. a) can you delimit between M/D. &amp; 3 Serv. Ministers?

under him.

b) ultimate responsibility of P.M. must be safeguarded.

Parly. consequences not dealt with. Rs. Spkr out of Chair debate shd.

May be better to go to that at 2nd stage.

This does it.

be removed: get away fr. 3 separate debates &amp; go for unified

Definition of reduced function of Service Ministers: and closer

Nomenclature. Many alternatives for M/D. (to keep that for P.M.)

E.W. Personalities: strong M/D. &amp; S of S. for War.

E.Sh. How does this differ from Inskip?

P.M. He had no executive functions, no staff.

E.B. And not much sense.

J.W. Will he have authy to settle research &amp; devel. p’mmes.

P.M. Yes. Para. 26.

E.Sh. x/ Para. 42 (b) P.Q.’s.

P.M. By practice. 324

E.B. S of S. for War will have to be changed? To Army.

P.M. Yes: later on.

evolution.

H.D. x/ Evolve. That is charm of this scheme. Flexible enough to permit

V. gt. help from Ty. angle – discuss with 1 Minister vice 3. At

present I get pushed into balance of expenditure between the 3,

b) No need for more than one Junior Minister in Service Dpts., on basis

supervisory.

E.B. Defence Cttee. M/Labour shd. be involved because of man-power,

training etc.

Mulberry nearly failed because 6 wks. passed before I was told

vital to defence. If M/L. doesn’t know he can’t lay his plans

Shd. rely on bringing Ministers in when they are concerned.

concerned.

M/Labour had never bn. warned to prepare for that.

wh. is not a financial issue.

E.Sh. a) Trend under this will be to increase work of M/Defence. Must face that. Bound to reduce standing of Service Ministers.

of my experience. As we go on, this will become more marked.

P.M. I agree – and intend both these consequences, in the long run.

R.S.C. Defence &amp; civilian research – correlation. What is intended?

P.M. Single Chairman of 2 Scientific Cttees.

R.S.C. Will want a link above the official level.

J.W. Co-relation of mil. &amp; civil aircraft research &amp; production.

T.W. Hope Service Ministers will have chance to speak on this.

E.W. Relations between P.U.S. of M/D. &amp; P.U.S. of Service Dpts. Mayn’t

a close relationship there under-mine posn of Service Ministers?

P.M. This is not a super-Minister. The spheres are exclusive, not

Representn on J.W.P.S. is not enough.

of it.

If defence is going to affect designers – dirn of training in industry is

accordingly.

P.M. On same principle, M/T. and B/T. must be permanent members.

E.B. Believe man-power &amp; other M/L. interests are more continuously

Example: only 14.000 draftsmen available when I took office. And

325

P.M. Ditto for scientists. But doesn’t follow that M/E. shd. be perm.

composition in W. Paper.

R.S.C. M/L. in difft. posn fr. the others quoted – he is continuously

Agreed: add M/Labour.

E.W. Wd. like to be consulted re

member of Def. Cttee. On that basis Cttee. wd. get much

too large.

H.M. On merits agree with P.M. Expediency: is it wise to mention the

interested.

common services – education.

Para. 20(c).

And M/Edn shd. be on the Bd.

P.L. Submn to Doms. Shd. it go to India?

R.S.C. To Viceroy? With discretion to mention to his Govt.

P.M. C.O.S. Comments. C.O.S. Cttee. Suggest: “&amp; he will also preside over

desire.” Agreed.

mtgs. with the C.O.S. whenever he or they may so Para. 31.

C.A.S. Location: premature.

P.M. Surely it’s essential. What will M/D. have if he hasn’t C.O.S.

organisation.

C.A.S. Close co-ordn with Cab. Secretariat has bn. element in its success.

R.S.C. “Within” vice “located in.” Agreed.

P.M. Second part of sentence is not redundant.

P.M. Para. 34. Will have to be re-considered in light of decision to defer decision re common services.

Para. 30. Revised draft.

Wiser to warn Parlt. now.

Importce of link betwn. M/D. &amp; Cab. Secretariat.

Legislation. Can we avoid 2 Debates? On Bill, not W. Paper?

Approve scheme – subject to drafting (for P.M.).

G.H. Para. 40. Some larger Colonies may be called on to do more

than [ ]. ? Omit.
