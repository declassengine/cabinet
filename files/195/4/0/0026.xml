C.M. 38 (46) 29th April, 1946

1. Palestine.

E.B. Still believe that, handled properly, with U.S. this might be settled.

Publish: watch re-actions: won’t be as bad as policy of Coalition. Features

in Rpt. which raise whole issue – many things to be discussed. We

can’t find the money.

Fear that Arab State may raise ques. at Sec. Council – at their initiative, I

wdn’t fear it.

Must have discns first with U.S. Govt. On disarming of both sides etc.

Agree we must try to get U.S. implicated in enforcemt. policy.

H.M. V. bad Rpt: unhelpful: irresponsible: unrealistic.

Rpt. accentuates existg. diffies – with both

If we put to Sec. Council, R. will come in: virtual surrender of mandate. Defeatist.

Take the line: can’t adopt this Rpt, w’out full consultn with U.S. Govt.

But if one of parties to Commn rushes off to Sec. Council, it wd. be fatal.

Asked Barnes why U.S. keen: found it was to prevent large Jew immigrn into U.S.

Prepare draft basis of negotiation with U.S. Don’t be upset by a little exuberance in M/East: won’t be as bad as our repves say.

G.H. Implicns of report – v. complex &amp; difficult.

Reference to Sec. Council wd. be for advice. Offl. Cttee contemplated discussion with U.S. first.

Much work in Pal. to be done, whr. or not this Rpt. is adopted.

Speed in discns with U.S. is essential – for fear of disorders in Pal.

My informn suggests Arab States will bring this to Sec. Council.

Imposs. for us to carry out Rpt alone. If U.S. won’t help, no alternative but to go to U.N.O.

We are being pushed around: &amp; Pal. is only remaing. foothold in M/E. Otherwise I wd. favour clearing out. sides - &amp; adds some further

financial &amp; adminve diffies.

Immediate action. Rpt. must be published. Then shindy will start. Problem

then is to gain time for thought etc. Shd. not therefore publ. with any

suggn of acceptance. Discuss with U.S. Don’t go to Sec. Council.

I wd. prefer Partition.

P.M. Agree. Commn have ignored everybody’s respons. but ours. Suggest we shd. take responsib. everywhere. We shd. now make U.S. say what share they will take. Say – rpt. recd: we are considg. it in consultn with U.S. Govt. 149

E.B. Publicity. Joint Rpt. Consultn with U.S. Posn of Arab &amp; Jews will have to be considered. Fundamental point – organised armed camp: Br. mustn’t be invited to send in more troops to deal with that. F.O., No. 10 and C.O. to co-operate on that.

H.D. Support E.B. Hold U.S. in, on both Mil. &amp; fin. implicns.,

If U.S. wd. co-operate fully, Rpt. not impossible.

C.I.G.S. Trouble on publn – cd. be handled.

Stress need for disarming &amp; disbanding J. organisations.

Don’t object to immed steps.

Wd. involve capital expendre of £100M and £5 - £10M annually. We can’t contemplate that.

Consequence – slowing down of demobiln.

Prefer U.S. co-operation.. Don’t like consequences of reference to U.N.O.

Tries our men pretty high to have to sit down under this provocation.

A.B. Disturbed by objns to seeking U.N.O. advice &amp; reasons for it.

Suggest tht. as U.S. involved we shd. discuss with them: but U.S. &amp; U.K. shd. notify U.N.O. tht. these discussions are procedg. Will arouse R. suspicious if we go on bi-laterally. At least some action to give notice tht. if U.K. &amp; U.S. negotns are unsuccessful Sec. Council will be asked to consider.

E.B. Don’t want to say anything at present re Sec. Council. Trouble enough there already.

A.B. Any one of the neighbouring States can raise it with U.N.O.

Doubtful about E.B.’s suggn of leavg. initiative with Arabs, if Anglo - U.S.

discns fail. Doesn’t arise yet, however. Next step is to put pressure on

U.S. to co-operate.

E.Sh. Exhaust first possibilities of Anglo. U.S. co-opn.

Remember how Commn arose – U.S. forced the pace.

Not sure of validity of P.M. &amp; H.M’s view on the Rpt. It is consistent with our moderate policy.

If U.S. won’t play, our position is clear. “You are making all this fuss, what are you prepd to do about it.” E.B. U.S. &amp; R. want specialised agency for this not U.N.O. We are sticking out

for U.N.O. but aren’t veto-ing the other suggn. McNeil is handling

this.

P.M. Any approach to U.N.O. in my view shd. be on Recommn 1.

E.Sh. There is a case for submns of whole ques of d.p.’s to U.N.O.

But want to avoid Sec. Council. If U.S. won’t co-operate Rpt. contemplates change in Mandate. Want that to go to Trusteeship Council: &amp; remainder to refugee side of U.N.O.

150

Needn’t go to Sec. Council unless disorder. Wd. prefer therefore to wait until taken there.

Want x/ for talk with Byrnes.

In other words, detailed case of what is involved in implementg. Rpt.

N.B. Try to get U.S. to approach this Jewish problem as part of refugee ques as a

whole.

{ Wd. like C.O.S. to make fuller analysis of forces requd if Rpt. implemented.

x { “ Ty. “ finance “

{ “ F.O. “ Jews in Europe &amp; priorities over d.p.’s.

Must also bring in Poles, in conversation with Byrnes

Also want C.O. apprecn of new mandate.

U.N.R.R.A. at Atlantic City passed a resolution wh. really commits U.S. &amp; R. Govts.

Believe this will come to Sec. Council, prob. thro’ Arab States. Cd. we y./ ask Offl. Ctee to consider what we shd. wish to emerge from a discn in Sec.

Council. E.g. finance for developmt. thro’ International Bank.

Inform Dom. Ministers to-day?

Agreed: Circulate pp.to-day &amp; discuss to-morrow.

A. Bring in C.O.I.

H.M. Nothing to do with Press.

A.B. Agree to immed. action. But don’t want to go to disarm etc. unilaterally.

P.M. Approve E.B.’s line.

Offl. Cttee to supervise prepn of material as at x/ and ? y/.

Publicity – F.O. and C.O. together – with Fr. Williams.

H.M. Talk to Lobby to-morrow to influence leading articles.

Nor do I want to be imploring U.S. for aid – dependence on U.S. Wd. prefer to bring it to a wider Court. – some organisn of U.N.

P.M. Truth is U.S. wants her interests at our expense.

E.B. I want to get this before U.S. Congress. U.S. adminn is v. weak &amp; irresponsible.

E.Sh. Shd. Cab. express a view on last weeks outrage?

P.M. Let Serv. Dpts. &amp; C.O.S. consider first.

G.H. Read telegram.

P.M. Get P. Notice Ques Tuesday: &amp; express appreciation of attitude of B. troops.

151

a) joint study by State Dpt. &amp; F.O.

b)

Agreed.

[Enter W.W

[Exit C.O.S., Sargent.

E.B. Want to get Byrnes to agree to

Considn by C.C.O.S.

H.M. Let W.S.C. &amp; A.E. O.F.G.S. have advance copies of Rpt. And P.M. to see them.

Strachey. A.M.

2. Report of Select Committee on Members’ Expenses. Consequential –

Leader of oppn &amp; ex. P.M.’s. to have half M.P.’s salary

Ministers at £5,000: no Govt. initiative. Possible tht. Oppn may suggest it.

Anomalous salaries – as in para. 7. Ch/Duchy – Parlt. or Funds of Duchy:

H.M. pleasure will have to be taken. Considered P.M.G. &amp; thght. on

balance better to leave as at present.

P.M. Capt. Yeoman Guard &amp; another who acts as Whips in H/Lds. get v. little.

Walkden &amp; Ammon.

H.D. As in memo.

Main deviation – salary of £1000 p.a. for Members.

Ministers under £5.000 to have half M.P.’s salary &amp; to claim expenses.

&amp; to claim expenses.

Then leave it to a free Vote.

H.D. This is outside t. of r. These are H/C. expenses, qua constituencies.

If anything to be done, it must be by adjustment of Salary. Same Cttee cd. look at it again. Needn’t be included in same announcement.

J.W. Also Solr. Genl. for Scotland. If he were in Parl., he wd. get less than Junior

Minister.

A.

H.D. No: he wd. get the same allowances. We have bn. asked to adjust his salary – propose £3.000 w’out fees.

Low-paid posns in H/Lds. Can we discuss with H.D.?

H.M. If not in this statement, say considerg. some similar adjustmts. in H/Lds. &amp; will make statement later.

H.D. Will try to do this.

152

Favour increase of salary to £1000 p.m. Always opposed idea of immunity

fr. tax for part of it. That point is now met.

E.Sh. Oppose this Rpt. Will increase anomalies.

But for the rest, I wd. prefer unconditional increase of salaries. e.g. from 1.500 to 2.000. and have him to claim expenses on that salary.

To give time 1/2 of M.P. salary + somthg. as Minister is anomalous.

If M.P., wtr. Minister or not, you shd. be able to claim expenses.

Diffies in whips’ office – so great that can’t fill my vacancies!

Better adopt H.D.’s plan.

Agreed – as in memo.

C.E. Wd. you give him 2.000 if in H/Lds?

E.Sh. You are proposing that for Junior office. holders in H/Lds. Prs. give less salaries in H/Lds.

Para. 5 proposal is untidy arrangemt. Put salary up to 2.500 &amp; let him claim.

P.M. Expenses not due wholly to constituency. “Two homes” applies to H/Lds. also.

H.D. Can’t be done w’out changing the law – which now provides that Ministers in H/C. are paid as Ministers not M.P.’s and can’t claim against salary his expenses as M.P.

H.M. Can’t admit P.M.’s argument. Appoint a Minister &amp; you must assume he lives on the job.

H.D. The 500 basis was taken because assumed that there is not the same case for his having 2 houses. Assume he lives on the job in Ldn.

W.W. Was satisfied tht. this Rpt. wd. meet wishes of H/C.

A.B. E. Sh. solution is tidier. But if you adopted it, you wd. run into academic Parly. Debate. The existg. law was designed to prevent Govt. placemen – to obviate clandestine means of providing them with money.

Also diff. for Bd./I.R. to argue expenses ques. with Ministers.

H.D. Tactically wise to leviate as little as possible from Rpt. of Select Cttee.

C.E. Also awkward to propose alteration in income tax law for Junior Ministers especially.

[Exit W.W.

H.M. Position of P.M.G. Heavy job? 153

P.M. Yes. Put him at £5.000

Agreed. H.D. to announce. Agreed.

[Enter J.W. &amp; B.S.

3. Import Programme for 1946/47. Must have clear understandg. that it is all subject to that.

b)

c) Want to balance external trade a/c at first half of ’47. Target.

H.M. (i) Wd. be useful next time to put it thro’ Ministerial Econ. Steering Cttee.

(iii)Control Commn shd. be asked to expedite G. exports.

H.D. I’m spending at £80M. This assumes £50M. – saving of £30M.

B.S. I cd. buy that.

B.S. Only 75% of pre-war imports. Wish it cd. be more. If I had money, believe

I cd. buy more e.g. canned fruit.

Risk of canalising trade too much betwn. those countries &amp; U.S.A.

(ii) The £30M. export from Germany is optimistic. Timber fr. B. Zone isn’t

promising.

H.D. a) All conditional on Loan going thro’. Otherwise, as in para. 6.

Balance/payments. see p.12. Transition Account. Necessary imports compete with no unnecessary overseas expendre. Must lose no opportunity to reduce mil. exp. overseas, wh. is running at v. high figure.

Latest estimate of deficit less than £687M. Improvemt. due to

a) better exports

b) shortages reducg. imports.

This is agreed among Dpts. as target. at official level.

(ii)Short fall because we cdn’t get imports we needed. Ty. have annexed advantages of that. Consider later whr we cdn’t switch some of the expendre. previously authd. Export drive shd. be presented as a drive to pay for imports – must have the imports if we are to get this understood by public.

Believe C. Commn are drinking 1 botl. hock p. head p. day. We cd. use that if it were exported.

H.M. Other points I will communicate to H.D.

P.M. £15M on imports of beer, wines &amp; spirits. Seems a lot.

A.B. Some imports lead directly to exports. Fr. can buy with gold – but readier to export to us if we did to them. Also Med. countries – food products.

Hope this is being considered.

Half timber is being cut then will be used for coal because coal prodn dropping thro’ lack of food. 154

Hope no Ty. objn to getting timber elsewhere if we can find it. Or

houses from Sweden if can be arranged w’out loss of timber fr.

Sweden.

A. a) Can M/F. be given elasticity to get variety? Apparently agreed.

A.

indicates cut in next year in imports fr. Rhodesia. Why? Will cause

E.Sh. Petrol rationing: p. 6. Means p’ponemt. until Sept.

Strong adminve &amp; pol. reasons for abandoning petrol rationg. as soon as

poss.

x/ After enquiry – no change of policy. Can’t explain figures. Will look into

this.

Agreed – as in memo.

b) Encouragemt. of S. African wines?

H.D. Yes: we are doing that. Australia too.

c) S. Rhodesia has doubled tobacco prodn at our request. But p.16

x/ consternn in Rhodesia.

Want it reviewed as soon as Loan goes thro’!

P.11 gives figures – wh. we think are too high for first 6 months.

H.D. Wd. prefer to review whole picture as soon as Loan is clear.

J.W. Machinery imports – v. important. Want more. Want it re-examined as soon as Loan decn is known.

T.W. Supported.

4. Leakage of Information. P.M. Apparent leak re Atomic Energy Bill.

J.W. Have already ordered an enquiry.

P.M. Will Ld. Chanc. look into this? J.W. to consult him.
