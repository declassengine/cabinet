C.M. 17 (46) 21st February, 1946

1. Parliament

H.M. Explained proposals.

P.M. Serious telegram from High Comm. Pal. – 19/2.

G.H. Disc. priv. in D. Cttee. Then agreed no action v. J. Agency or Hagana. Clear now the pos n deterg rapidly. Shertok: speech this week wh. is seditious : but as A.A. commn due in Pal. five days H.C. decided unwise to take action v. him.

Indicn tht. much prepn made by Hagana for action. H.C. believes no action will be taken until AA. Commn leaves. But clear that 3 mil. organns are coming together for active intervention.

Telegram read.

P.M. In speech to-day G.H. shd. give warng. tht. we can’t yield to terrorism.

G.H. Ol. Stanley tells me this a.m. they will raise genl. issues re Commn on its work.

E.B. Told me he wdn’t. I was v. this debate. Will cause debate in Congress.

H.M. House was promised Debate, when E.B. made original statement.

E.B. I will speak to A.E. &amp; Stanley – pressing them not to discuss work of Commn.

Remember this is Anglo. U.S. Commn.

A.B. On telegram: shdn’t H. Comms. be warned not to pay too much attentn to words of demagogues. (E.B. Shertok is not demagogue)

P.M. This is not merely hot air: terrorist action is procedg. m’while – and these words stir them up.

2. Jamaica. Industrial Situation.

Service indust. trouble Jamaica. Walk-out fr. m. hospital. Fire brigade on strike. 20 lives lost. But post is now in hand.

Fight betwn. Bustamente’s Union &amp; T.U.C.

1. Parliament

Next wk. motion on Pensions – wide support fr. Govt. supporters.

Cab. decided we were to refuse Sel. Cttee.

Will be diff. – if carried to Divn. we shall be defeated.

[Exit W.W.

[Enter P.M.G. &amp; G.I. Hall

3. Government Information Services

P.M. (a) Ministerial Responsibility for B.B.C.

Choices: a) non-Departmental b) P.M.G. c) Ty.

Arguments as in Rpt. Objns to a) no staff.

Suggest: G.P.O. to take Vote &amp; handle day-to-day ques.: x non. Dpl. Minister in background to handle major policy. xChairman of Ministerial Cttees.

P.M. Ullswater Cttee thght. P.M.G. must remain respons. for techn. ques. &amp; accountg. but a non. Dpl. Minister shd. handle major policy.

R.S.C. Constitutionally P.M. wd. be responsible &amp; wd. devolve this on the non. Dep. Minister.

A.B. Let this be known &amp; you will have a spate of Ques. at once.

You also imply tht. B.B.C. is under Govt. control.

R.S.C. Broad ques. cd. be addressed to P.M. – constitutionally proper.

E.Sh. Once Chairman is known, you’ll be asked what his functions are &amp; Ques will then be addressed to him.

R.S.C. Needn’t say functions include B.B.C.

H.M. The Chairman wd. come in only in Debate not Ques.

E.B. Prefer to have it with P.M.G. I want to see a Press Service inwards developed – Reuters ineffective. If B.B.C. linked too closely with Govt. this cd. not be done by B.B.C. Wd. prefer therefore tht. B.B.C. shd. remain under purely technical Dpt. like G.P.O.

H.M. A.E. priv. wanted it publicly announced tht. B.B.C. was working under F.O. dirn qua overseas work. That, in my view wd. be dangerous – glad E.B. thinks so.

Must be some relation between B.B.C. and our Cttees &amp; their Chairman &amp; C.O.I.

G.P.O. can’t do that. Cd. Be arranged.

L. One additional point. If G.P.O. had to defend B.B.C. accounts, it wd. involve addl. work &amp; staff for G.P.O. Cd. be met by transfer of personnel from M. of I.

Believe respons. cd. be shared btwn. P.M.G. &amp; Chairman. Dangers – mustn’t confuse Parlt. &amp; public as to who is responsible and for what. If that is made clear &amp; there is real workg. partnership btwn. Ministers it wd. work.

Agreed: P.M.G. to take the Vote: genl. policy ques. to be answered

30

by P.M. or Minister deputed to act for him.

(b) Future of British Council

H.M. Either abolish it or confine it to cultural matters. At present there is indefensible overlapping. Must order material thro’ C.O.I.

Responsibility – Ministerial – also for considn.

E.B. My first re-action: shd. be under inter-Dep. Cttee: F.O. control – C. Service apptmts.

Trouble: built up under incompetence of Malcolm Robertson, after Lloyd left.

Was Opposed to F. Stewart’s recommn in favour of continuance.

But H.M. has bn. into it &amp; proposes to compromise.

Agree you can’t abolish this.

A lot of this work shd. be done by Consular Service when I’ve built it up.

Work towards abolition: but accept Plan A for the moment. But the Chairman of B. Council shd. be directed to report regularly to me – as if sub. Dpt.

A.V.A. Agree with E.B.’s remarks. But wd. be a pity if nothg. was maintd to keep cultural &amp; educational activities going – at a time when we need to present B. views to the world.

J.J.L. In agreement. Too many frills – but good work.

G.H. x/Separate expenditure in Colonies. /x Recently was excessive. grant-in-aid. But actually wasn’t reached. Look estimatg. Insufft. F.O. supervision.

Evce of their work abroad, at first-hand. Usually in co-opn with Embassies etc. Want x/ continued.

A.B. Opposed to this. Temporary arrangement. You won’t get 1st class man for that.

Either have it, with a good man: or abolish it.

If under F.O. no good man will take it on.

Grant-aided organn well manned to put B. case across – can be useful. Normal method shd. be interchange of professional etc. men: where this isn’t possible B. Council can help.

P.M. That is really what is suggd- under Plan A. Will be contd for 5 yrs or so even tho’ we don’t rule out eventual abolition.

H.M. Agree considerable flexibility &amp; independence. But some control must be exercised by C.O.I. or F.O.

J. F.O. control tho’ not creature of F.O.

A. We favour Plan A. Functions must be limited &amp; defined. Control of a/c: &amp; adminn: but independence in their work.

31

A.B. Wd. rather have control by P.M. than by F.O.

E.B. Am reforming F.O. Can’t have competitors outside my control because of past reputn of F.O.

R.S.C. Agree to Plan A. But shd. be definite term – to enable recruitment.

P.M. Yes: 5 years.

G. H. Do you approve last para. of Plan A?

P.M. Yes: so long as you don’t go into great detail.

H.M. These conclns must be subject to review.

(c) Admiralty Points

P.M. As in brief. Which horse will you ride?

H.M. We agreed on Monday – shd. be contractg. out – on merits after considn by Cttee. It is for Service Dpts. to make their case – not ask for snap decisions.

S. I thought I was covered by para. 6.

Leave it at para. 6.

A.V.A. What about para. 2!

P.M. This is a matter for me.

(d) Publicity for B. Commonwealth.

E.B. Russians &amp; others steeped in 19th Cent. literature – but know nothg. of modern facts of B. Empire.

Cd. this new organisn be getting busy &amp; get best men to work on new books on B. Commonwealth. Analogue to Trevelyan Social History.

R.S.C. Chatham House initiative?

H.M. Take it up early on Overseas Services Cttee.

R.S.C. Development contract – grant to University.

4. Political Broadcasting.

Agreed.

[Exit P.M.G.

[Enter Shawcross

[Tomlinson

32

5. Service Divorce Cases

J. Congestion. P.Q.’s in H/C. At present rate will take 5/7 years to finish arrears. Intolerable.

Not lack of Judges: it’s delay in preparg. cases for trial.

Target: we shd. try to clear off arrears in 2 years.

Recommns Para. 3(1)(a). This anticipates Rushcliffe recommns &amp; is in line with them.

Para. 3(1) (b) - (d) – want Cab. support for necessary priorities etc.

E.Sh. Endorsed.

J.J.L. Welcomed report.

G.A.I. V. diff. 4 wks. recently only 23 shorthand writers found for Govt. Dpts. Similar figures for typists.

Training schemes (M/L) are available – 6 months. But real trouble is salaries. They can get £6 a week outside.

G.H. Ty. are considering. But Law Socy. can’t get them even at £5 a wk.

E.E.B. Proposal for v. large increase. Banks &amp; big business say. however, we shd. be puttg. market up. It is small firms wh. are paying too much. You must increase supply as well.

G.A.I. Agree we must look ahead. Some increase in pay + attractns of C. Service.

H.M. Shortage is not permanent surely.

How many are in Services.

Ty. can’t compete with v. high rates.

E.B. Have the hours bn. reduced?

Gl. H. Yes: 431/2 or 44.

G.T. Accommodation. Diff. in larger prov. towns. May have to requisition for this. I will report, if so.

In Ldn. competn is with F.O., M/C. Av., M/L. &amp; another! Shall it rank in same level?

[Exit. E.Sh. &amp; Toml

[Enter Barnes

6. Future Use of “Queen Elizabeth”.

Barnes. Rptd because of publicity attracted by Queens. Concln as in memo.

Alternative uses – wd. be uneconomic. And re conversion of 2 Queens wd. be overlapping. And we shd. lose traffic.

33

P.M. a. Won’t you be criticised now. She cd. go round the Cape.

b. “Economic” – is a luxury liner worth having?

B. India via Cape – she cd. use only Trincomalee. That isn’t embarkn port. Feeder shipping wd. have to be used.

P.M. Singapore? B. Feeder ships wd. be needed there too.

B. Speed reduced – bunkering problems – carrying capacity 50% of what it is on Atlantic. We shd. be makg. a gesture, that is all.

Diffr. matter if rpatn problem cdn’t be handled by shipping we have.

In reply to b. there’s no doubt they will earn dollars. It won’t all go by air.

R.S.C. And it isn’t all luxury suites.

E.B. When we re-convert, we shd. see that more room is allocated to people of lower incomes. That wd. influence my mind.

E.Sh. Not merely luxury liners. But that is their main source of income.

And unless they are re-converted……

Did they pay pre-war? Thght Cos. regarded them as white elephants.

V. large commitmt. in ship. bldg. labour.

If choice betwn. re-convertg them &amp; bldg. cargo liners might have to decide in favour of second.

G.A.I. Wd. be diffy. with industry if we had to divert labour to this fr. construction &amp; repair.

R.S.C. Sufferg. fr. shortage of passenger space. Hitting exports already. Can’t get our repves away. We want more smaller ships running to other parts of the world – Queen on N. Atlantic wd. indirectly relieve posn.

P.L. Agreed: Lack of passages to India.

A. a. Don’t fall down on “brides” p’mme.

b. Drowned with applns for passages. Masses of people want to travel by sea. Enormous demand from Canada.

Barnes. a. Oct/Nov 1374 Civil Fr. India. 396 were below cat. 6 in G/India priorities.

G/India shd. clear top categories first.

b. Brides. Queen Mary can help in May. P’mme agreed with Canada.

H.M. Can in presentn of this case.

On merits – think B. is right provided trooping p’mme not interfered with. Then ques. of future of our M. marine. By ’47 big sea traffic in N. Atlantic 7 we must be ready for it.

E.Sh. Competn with new constn v. serious. May be longer than 6 months.

34

Barnes If we don’t get on with re-conversion now, we’ll get a jam in autumn. What point in laying by these v. expensive vessels.

P.M. Is this economical use of ship. bldg. labour?

G.A. I. Wd. like to know what men they wd. need.

Barnes. Not askg. at present for addl. labour.

G.A.I. But I’m w’drawg. labour fr. the yards.

A.V.A. Not yet discussed with M/W.T. Anxious re materials as well as labour. Cuts made in dockyard man power – inclined to risk row of doing civil work in dockyards.

A.B. C/Eng. labour is rising v. steeply.

Want more informn about facts.

E.B. Why no inter. Dpl. talk beforehand?

But my bias in favour of using these ships – if she’s re-converted right for lower income groups.

P.M. Put back for more informn re {labour involved.

{cos. intentn re future use.

J.J.L. Troops will assume tht. if she’s taken off trooping will be delayed.

Future redn of Python.

Referred to L.P. Cttee. [Exit Barnes.

7. Scheme for Bringing Children to U.K. from Germany

Memo approved.

8. I.L.O. Constitution.

G.A.I. Nec. to enable I.L.O. to fit in to U.N.O.

Memo approved.

9. R. Indian Navy: Disorders in Bombay

A.V.A. Signal. Pl. send assistce to Bombay. Vessels of R.I. Fleet menacing shore

Add? also to Comms. E. Ind. Fleet. He will act.

Glasgow was expected 23/2. also 2 other smaller vessels.

Hitherto v. fine force. But after R.A.F. troubles in India, it spread first to Indian A.F. then to R.I.N.

35

P.L. No informn yet fr. Viceroy – tho’ I asked for it night before last.

P.M. Can’t understand that. Remind him – at once.

H.M. Trials shd. have bn. outside India.

A.V.A. But this is just what was foreshadowed by Viceroy in January.

E.B. Pay? Took me 12 mos. to get G/India to accept rise wh. M/W.T. was anxious to give – because repercussions on R.I. Navy. They were £19 a month below Chinese!

E.Sh. Is this politics – or claim for more pay or food?

A.V.A. Political apparently.

R.S.C. Everything in India must be political now.

A.V.A. P.M. to see C.N.S. before H/C. to-day in case this shd. be raised.
