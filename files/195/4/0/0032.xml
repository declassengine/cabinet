C.M. 44(46). 9th May, 1946.

1. Parliament.

H.M. Business for next week.

2. Railway Fares of Peers. H.D. Simultaneous in both Houses.

3. Members of Parliament: Salaries of Officers in H/Lords

H.M. A. came to Party mtg; &amp; was so conciliatory tht. no objn raised.

H.D. Now verified can be done w’out legn.

A. When can I announce? - Tuesday week?

.

A. Ammon – senior Whip in H/Lds. Cd. he have more?

Agreed: A. to consider with H.D.

4. M.P.’s - B/Trade Working Parties. President of B/T.).

H.M. Diffce betwn. R.S.C. and me as Leader of House (not as actg.

In genl. have bn. pressing T.U.’s to let their working officials become M/P’s. Unions say this is diff. if we are barring T.U. offls. from

M.P. nominated by one of the industrial parties.

Not much in first point – political views. More in 2nd – participn in

job: shdn’t disclose inside story of workg. party in subs. debate

man’s own conscience.

In genl. don’t interfere with T.U. choice.

G.B. Accept that. But this isn’t ordinary T.U. work. Undesirable for spirit

Can’t believe Union can’t find another repve.

T.U. work, such as this, when an M.P.

Agree therefore tht. Minister shdn’t choose M.P.’s: but see no objn if

subs. debate. That cd. be met by telling them this was a T.U.

in H/C. Cd. even ask them not to speak at all: tho’ I think that

wd. go too far. 3rd point – interference with Parly duties: for the

of w. party tht. one member shd. be able to spk. in subsequ. H/C.

debate.

Work: 2 days a week, mainly out of Ldn. Linoleum: Scotl. &amp; Lancs. :

might involve 3 days a week, mainly out of Ldn.

180

H.D. Not matter of v. gt. importance. Theory in B/T: practical argument of

L.P. is stronger. Put Hewitson on.

Wd. endanger chances of preventing T.U.’s to allow active members to

G.A.I. Support H.M. Don’t limit choice of Union repves.

Time spent on Cttees &amp; R. Commns – just as much – no objn raised to

that.

go into Parlt.

W.W. R. Commns etc., sit in Ldn. Point out that this job takes them out of Ldn.

Needs watching – if too many away.

P.M. No support for B/T. view? No.

Decided in favour of H.M. [Exit G.B., W.W.

5. Expenses of Members of Local Authorities. P.M. Case for enquiry – unless M/A point is too urgent.

Posn in Scotland differs – some liberty to pay remun. time. Diff. for

Conclude a) authy to accept amendmt. re

A.B. Urgent not only because of that but also because nec. for me to make

some statemt. on genl. policy at next Party mtg.

him to refuse it for new Hosp. Boards.

Cd. be included in Block Grant Bill next Session. Avoid separate Bill.

Cdn’t deal there, however, with Hosp. Reg. Bds. Must do that on

Health Bill. If we do that, imposs. to resist some demand for

l.a. mtgs.

Strong argument for enquiry – functions of l.a.’s in melting pot.

Loss of trading functions etc. Shd. be examd with that in view.

Cdn’t resist paymt. for boros’. Also resist Exch. grant. Reg. Bds. b) enquiry into

J.W. Agreed with this concln.

genl. ques.

Case for enquiry. But accept principle re new Health Services.

A.G. Have the Ty. Cttee under 6(b).

H.M. Feeling in Party is v. strong. Accept principle with regret. Value of tradn of unpaid public service in Local Govt. But with growth of

before Party Confce: they can then be told it is under considn:

prefer somethg. simple &amp; modest. Safeguards v. abuse also.

l.g. and wide areas some change is prs. inevitable. Appt. Cttee

and can pass a resoln if they like.

Enquiry shd. also go into cumulative paymts. E.g. in Scotland: fares,

subsistence and loss of remunerative time. Goes pretty far. Wd.

Hosp. Bds. Try to find a precedent pro tem. &amp; put it in Bill on that basis.

181

H.D. Support both a) and b) in para. 6.

Cdn’t agree to Exch. grant under (a). If Cab. agree, that shd. be made

specific in t. of r. of Cttee – e.g. payment from the rates.

That is enough for Party conference.

Once concede this to l.a.’s, it will spread to other bodies e.g. Co.

J. Dangers of spread. Repns re

Para. 6(b): will be an easy enquiry: plenty of precedents. Can be

done quickly.

T.W. Support 6(a). Share H.M.’s feelings.

Agric. Cttees.

Need for care over this.

Magistrates. Most cases employers allow

R. Commn will be apptd to consider posn of Magistrates.

G.A.I. Support 6(a).

But wd. have to be extended to many M/L. boards etc.

them to sit but they lose their working time. I’ve replied -

Hope it will be loss of remunerative time – not fee basis.

Need for great care.

Memo. approved. [Enter A.H.

6. India: Constitutional Problem.

P.M. Danger of a break. May be at wk. end. Wd. prefer a Cab. before

statement made. But that may not be poss. Want therefore to

tell Cab. how things have bn. going.

somethg. like tht. will be accepted. Need for some agreemt. re

3 tier-system. All-India organisation: groups: provinces. May be

skeleton outline constitn before any constituent body appointed.

Also need to form interim Govt. in which all Parties co-operate.

Hope we may get some agreement. If not, however, need for early

Confce. Our statement must therefore be v. careful.

notice.

H.D. Are we trying to get them to accept it. And if they reject, is it that

scheme we will announce?

Cab. Off. to collect week-end addresses. [Exit A.H.

statement.

May be tht. they wd. accept it from us, even tho’ rejected in

Vital to avoid leakage. May therefore be nec. to call Cab. at short

Also proposed another group for Indian States.

Elab. &amp; diff. - will need much working out.

If so, cdn’t a Cttee handle it?

P.M. No. Must be a Cab. decn. V. big ques. Also accords with basis of

directive to Mission.

182

7. Peace Conference: Situation at C.F.M. Paris.

&amp; when prepn complete wider confce on 1/5 of main

P.M. Moscow decision: 4 F. Ministers to prepare drafts of Peace Treaties

belligerents. Inconsistency.

May 1st come &amp; gone. Govts have prepd to meet – e.g. Doms.

M. takg. line – no confce until agreemt. on drafts. Others take opp.

view.

Also considered Confce cd. propose amendmts. Smaller Govts.

resent not havg. had better show, esp. since Fr. are in C.F.M.

Pressure of Doms. tht. Confce be called. Risk that R. might stand out.

Read telegrams from E.B. re Byrnes’ proposal at C.F.M. for callg.

Conf. on 15/6.

Asks for authy to support B. in principle &amp; insist on reasonable

interpn of Moscow decision.

A.B. Wish we had taken the initiative.

P.M. E.B. wanted to prevent sudden breach with Soviet Govt.

Agreed: give that authy to E.B.

[Enter Marquand.

8. Commercial Policy.

H.M. As in memo.

Emphasis on that.

with B/T. – if genl. view accepted.

Even if we didn’t get Loan breathg. space wd. have to be longer –

E.Sh. That’s another argument for deferring.

if we do get it, it doesn’t follow we shd. always play in with U.S.

H.D. Wtr. we get Loan or not will make vital diffce to our comm. policy.

Will affect time factor enormously. Until we get Loan can’t

begin unfreezing.

Ec. &amp; Soc. Council Cttee – code of good commercial behaviour. Must

reserve our posn pending Loan. If we don’t get it, we shall have

to be highly restrictive.

y/ This draft – esp p.4 paras (d) &amp; (e) – needs stiffening. Cd. I clear that

M. Agree a matter of timing.

might be years – but this sort of agreemt. wd. still be to our

benefit long-term.

E.Sh. Agree in genl. But is it wise to press for Confce in Europe?

H.M. Big offl. team.

If we don’t get Loan reconsider comm. policy. I believe tht. even

For they don’t link it up with Tariff Policy - &amp; that is the vital

point in comm. policy. U.S. want to export, &amp; extend credits, to

183

all pts. of world: &amp; forget tht. for repaymt. they must revise their

tariff policy.

Agreed.

A.B. Risk of bargaining.

Need to delay. To reconsider policy.

Suggest therefore a) don’t insist on Europe.

b) insist tht. tariff ques. must be interlinked.

A. Doms. expect prelim. Dom. Confce in July. Nash wants to know wtr.

still on. Memo. recommends it. Will Cab. agree to that?

N.B. Supported H.M.’s memo.

Advantages in p’ponement. But avoid lettg. ques. cool off in U.S. or

tariffs startg. up in Europe.

A.B. Relations with Peace Confce?

H.M. Can’t help that.

Aim at getting Peace Treaties first.

H.D. That is consistent with proposal for delay.

N.B. Anyway, we agree with U.S. on Peace Treaties.

G.H. We concur in draft. But shd. say – much concern in Colonies re preferences &amp; group purchase. Essential to get a Commonw.

view on these ques.

H.D. Machinery to tie up interests of economic Dpts. Need for integration.

x/ Leave it for further consultn.

Econ. Dpts. must be in the lead.

Agreed: subject to x/ and y/.

9. The U.S. Loan.

P.M. If Loan fails, shall we be ready with alternative plans at once?

H.D. Yes: w’in 48 hours.

E.E.B. “War Book” drill is in advanced prepn.

J.J.L. Cd. H.M. give Halifax indicn of mood of country.

[Exit Marquand.

10. Palestine.

P.M. Handed round message from President Truman.

184

H.M. An optimistic time-table.

A.B. Good that U.S. are involving themselves in a further step.

N.B. This procedure will induce J. &amp; A. to put views in most extreme form.

I wd. prefer 2 Govts. to confer first. They will have to impose decn in

the end.

E.Sh. Disagree with N.B. Wd. like time-limit extended.

P.M. a) Movement of 100.000. Haven’t we got 1.200 on the move

from Basi?

G.H. Yes: but further boat-load of illegal immigrants on its way.

P.M. b) I shd. see Harriman first.

c) I shd. say tht. as we are Mandatory it will take us longer to

consider Rpt.

Want oppy also to talk to E.B. Can’t therefore give immed.

reply.

H.D. Remind Harriman tht. our Palestine policy must depend on U.S.

answer to our enquiry re financial &amp; mil. support.

A.B. Don’t turn the heat on yet. They are wading in.

G.H. Material prepd for E.B.’s proposed talks with Byrnes. Thought we

wd. submit this to Pal. Cttee &amp; Cabinet.

H.M. Wait until Cab. Monday when E.B. here.

P.M. Will send interim reply.

11. Prosperity and Production Campaign.

A.B. Production Meetings. a) Doubt efficacy b) Doubt wisdom of puttg.

burdens on Ministers. P.M. certainly doing too much.

Shd. this campaign be contd below Reg. level.

H.M. I’ve done only one – another to come. Thought it was helpful.

True exhortn can be overdone. But public like to be talked to.

Gather other Ministers felt they were good. Heard A.B.’s was

spec. successful.

Perhaps cd. bring it to an end after this [round] series.

Posters are good: have approved some to-day. Continue with printed

publicity.

185

G.A.I. Rpts. suggest mtgs so far have bn. valuable.

Agree we’re doing too much. Awkward to cancel those already

planned.

A.B. Make more use of back-benchers.

H.M. Spkers’ notes.

Will try to put brake on – for Ministers.
