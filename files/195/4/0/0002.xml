C.M. 14 (46) 11th February, 1946

1. Indonesia: Discussion in Security Council.

E.B. Van K. said no objn to mission into conduct of B. troops, so long as not Dutch troops!

Hence suggn = enquiry into cond. of our troops, tho’ no one asks for their w’drawal.

This time I followed V.’s line &amp; said I wdn’t agree to such a resoln.

Clear that R. objection is to get foot-hold in S.E.A. If we have diffy. in India, they wd. demand enquiry into that tho’ we are sovereign power. We shall have to study terms of Charter on that – v.v - to B. Empire – after U.N.O. mtg. is over: &amp; I must be careful not to set precedent.

Thus, in last speech, narrowed it down to conduct of B. troops &amp; refused enquiry into that.

Levant: decided not to give B. propn to Genl. Lecture, hated by Levantines.

Egypt: doubt if we can retain B. troops there. Must consider whole of M/E strategy. If we keep troops there (Egypt) must be by invitation &amp; on mutual territory.

B. Empire must face this.. Australia is in much more danger fr. R. than ever was from Japan. Power politics reaching down to S.E.

No support fr. U.S. – who think their role is conciliation between U.K. &amp; R. This is not merely a row over Indonesia. V. serious situation for B. Empire. Must consider as a whole soon after U.N.O.

J.J.L. Support F.O. in refusing enquiry. Our soldiers are in v. gt. diffy. there. Wd. sooner bring our troops out, if Dutch don’t support.

P.M. If Dutch insist on their sovereign rights they can look after them alone.

If any enquiry it is for C.C.O.S., by whose orders we are there.

E.Sh. What is the game on S. Council – can’t we take the offensive.

W. Bloc. supposed to be v. internatl. unity. But other Blocks now forming. Shd. we not close up with W. Powers for our own protn?

E.B. S. Democracy must become more cohesive – Communism is v. cohesive.

Believe U.S. will turn away from extreme capitalism in 5-6 years.

Diffies. because undisciplined statements from among our own Party.

A.B. This is a bit pessimistic. Procdgs. of last 2 wks. have done us good, not harm, in eyes of the world.

Vote of Poland (a Communist) last week. In countries round R. there are signs of anti R. bias. Communist war in Europe may be about to recede. Mustn’t therefore let R. force us into untenable position.

Hence importce of early agreemt. with Egypt &amp; Arab States. Prospects of vol. agreemt. on diff. (economic) basis. Egypt is the clue to this.

6

A.V.A. F.O. doing well: but agree with his picture. of. pre. election statements from Moscow. Intentn to retain Army etc. Threat is Turkey, who’ve said they’ll fight if attacked by R.

Want E.B. to know he has Cabinet support.

P.M. Agree – rallying to E.B.’s lead. Must consider M/East policy as whole.

J. E.B. shd. take strong line with Van K. privately.

See also X/ below.

2. South-East Asia. Commissioner General. F.O. Staffing Problems.

E.B. We discussed need for co-ordinated policy in Far East. Diffy. in finding the man. Selected Killcarn. Famine over rice. Will put Sir R. I. Campbell in Egypt.

F.O. Staff. Diffy. arises from gaps in entry, driving last two wars. Am posting Stevenson to China – to concentrate on trade rather than politics. Genl Crawford going to Greece vice Scobic. Leeper to leave Greece. Other moves impending. W’in F.O. am also going to make changes. Must move steadily. Moving le Ronqetal from Romania.

H.M. Paris?

E.B. Not yet.

G.H. Must be careful in announcg. Killcarn’s appomt. – to prevent confusion with Govr. Genl. Malaya.

P.L. [ Durg. war these difficies (Item 1) were resolved by Heads of State. Wd. there be advantage in approach to Stalin?

x/

E.B. [ No. Had it out with him in Moscow &amp; he accepted our posn.

A.B. [ Real expln is stresses within Russia. Hang on pro tem.

T.W. Agreed: return of Red Army addg. to diffies Much disturbance.

This is largely to divert attention from R. own domestic diffies.

G.A.I. Gt. impn made by E.B. in U.S.

3. India

P.M. Propose to send out S/S. India, R.S.C. and A.V.A.

Party Delegn returng. to-morrow. Better not announce in this busy week. Prefer Tuesday of next wk.

R.S.C. Personal diffies – sooner the better. Can’t buy clothes or get inoculated!

7

After discussion, accepted Tuesday.

H.M. Present economic troubles at home, shall we criticised for sending R.S.C. to India?

P.M. Probably we shall – but must face it.

A.B. Indicate who will take charge.

R.S.C. Want H.M. to do so.

P.L. Read telegram from Viceroy – who wants to know before announcement is made reactions of H.M.G. to his proposals. This is unreasonable. Hope to square him.

Agreed: announce Tuesday.

3. Import Programmes for 1946.

[Enter Barnes, Smith,

Wilmot

H.D. Have spoken to P.M. &amp; E.B. about overseas commitments. E.B. has often agreed we can’t go on indefinitely. Have also raised it at Def. Cttee. But feel I must bring the thing to Cab. as a whole.

Thus 3 questions.

a) imports for first 6 months, I need decisions today.

b) overseas deficit = no decision to-day: but small Cttee of M.

c) dried eggs, wh. I’ve discussed with M/F.

a) Deal first with a). Income £705M. Exoprt over £1.500M, even on my reduced p’mme. i.e. £1.075M for imports : £300M. for mil. expre overseas : £100M for pol. commitmts overseas. Deficit: over £800M. U.S. loan is only £900m odd: &amp; we haven’t yet got it. Nor have we got loan from Canada or agreemts. with sterling countries.

b) On overseas exprt: we must seek relief. W’draw troops or make people pay. Why shdn’t Dutch pay for Indonesia – they have gold reserves, more than we have, as have the French too.

No more “special cases”. Foreigners shd. give money for value in future.

On a) and b) together, draw attentn to paras. 14-16 and 19. P’mme recommd is in para. 16.

Keynes’ paper. Not every figure reliable: but total shows v. bleak position. Madness of our policy in Germany.

France &amp; Holland - no more loans, they are better off than us.

Egypt: sterling balance of £700M &amp; rising because of contd presence of B. troops. we borrowg. money from Egypt to keep them there.

Must change this trend. Esp. “cuttg. down our overseas expend.”.

8

P.M. Overseas expre – we must play a hand. And we can’t pull out troops at present. Don’t see why Dutch &amp; Fr. shdn’t pay. Or why some of our friends eg. Canada shdn’t help in Germany.

Ministers need more time for long-term. Consider again later i.e. (b).

R.S.C. Our figures based on assumpn no switch to home consumptn.

Looks as if we cd. attain the £700M – except for possible. loss of prodn for lack of coal. If coal shortage continues or gets worse, we might drop to £600 or 550M.

Overseas expendre – not all mil. &amp; pol.: some = trade credits. This is remuneration for the future. E.G. telephones in Poland. Suggest some sum be set aside for that.

B.S. a) Except for manuf. meats, I can make no diet improvemt. on this p’mme

No increase in bacon – oils &amp; fats. App. C. shows tht. all my desired improvemts. are cut out on financial grds.

Believe there easemts. wd. have earned dividends in increased prodn.

Fear period of frustration – money to spend &amp; nothg. to buy – with conseqn. drop in prodn.

Wd. cost only about £20M. additional.

H.D. c) Dried Eggs. 18.000t. I conceded at last Cab. mtg. The more I give now on dried eggs the less I can concede later on other things. But I wd. go even higher on 2 conditions, i.e. to 21.000 tons. He asked for 24.000. I offered 9 + 9 for 2 half years. Now offer 9 + 12. But on condn (i) but if we don’t get U.S. loan he will have to cut it back, this not necessarily on d. eggs wholly; and (ii) wtr. the amount comes off other easements.

Wd. be wrong to go further – over a mere political flurry.

B.S. Obvious that condn (i) can’t be challenged.

As rgds (i) easements offered are only war-torn areas etc., doesn’t include U.S. Can’t therefore offset as proposed.

E.Sh. No credit now for concession. Why make any?

H.M. Trouble is surely no shell. egg increase because of new cuts in animal feed. It is therefore new situation: not mere concession to shouting.

B.S. Further reason: want to order enough to keep plant in operation.

E.B. On a). Do the calculns allow enough for introdn of shipping in 1946. Need for machinery to co-ordinate M/W.T. &amp; import &amp; export Dpts. No solution to be found by general discussions. Assume K.’s picture is right, can only be cured by practical means. Dodging the dollar area – gettg. supplies Fr. other sources.

H.D. These figures are for imports fr. all sources – not dollar only. And it is standg. instn to Dpts. to avoid dollar purchases.

E.B. Can’t go on much longer w’out variety.

9

Solution via manipulation of shipping. M/W.T. Agreed.

Take these figures as the problem – then have Cab. Cttee &amp; Officials to find solution thro’ alternative sources of supply.

A. Cd. tap Doms. if we were willg. to make long-term contracts.

Eg. S. Rhod. tobacco. Crop was doubled in war. Cd. be doubled again if we cd. give assurance of contd orders.

R.S.C. Can’t tie ourselves up in that way just before I.G.A. Conference.

We shd. have to adopt entirely diff. kind of economy.

A.B. We were assured B. Woods decns were not inconsistent with bulk purchase agreemts. with Doms. Let U.S. know we are forced to these measures to keep our people alive – then they’ll come to heel.

Can’t step up prodn w’out more things to buy.

H.M. Wrong to suppose tht. this Rpt. arises only from dollar expenditure.

The Rpt. deals with all overseas expendre.

K’s paper shd. be taken v. seriously.

We’ve got an Ec. analysis internal: this was companion piece to that. On the Survey we found an inflationary gap &amp; we’ve taken steps to adjust it. We must do the same with overseas expendre. Unless we do, we shan’t be able to buy what we need.

No time to consider or comment. Must have it considered – either by Ministers or offls. with freedom to comment on mil.&amp; foreign policy.

P.M. Def. Cttee are doing that.

H.M. Shd. be considered in its economic setting.

A.V.A. Agree re size &amp; importance. Don’t like some of K.’s attitude eg. “cut a dash”. Also £937M. only fr. U.S. loan, vice what K. hoped for last May. Also doubt if some of estimates can be accepted. e.g. as reqd. future cost of Forces abroad.

£50M. wd. make a big difference to “austerity” question.

P.M. On (b) wd. be useful to have examination by officials.

E.Sh. If so, they must relate everything to everything else. Can’t decide until we’ve seen everything.

K may have exaggerated. Position coloured by dollar diffy. Are there not alternative sources of supply in Doms.?

P.M. That is being covered by study of what we wd. have to do if no U.S. Loan. Suggest we now accept the p’mme for 1st half of 1946.

New Cttee won’t help. Want all existg. Cttees &amp; Dpts. to keep dollar diffy. in mind.

R.S.C. Only lack of liaison is between Defence Cttee &amp; economic situation.

10

P.M. H.D. has expld situation orally. This memo cd. be circulated too.

R.S.C. Nor do Cab. get rpts. from Def. Cttee.

P.M. I will look into that point – hadn’t realised it.

A. Support for makg. Dutch &amp; French pay.

P.M. I will ask C.O.S. or Def. Cttee to consider.

E.B. Wd. rather w’draw Fr. Indonesia than have it said we supplied mercenaries to the Dutch.

P.M. W’drew.

E.B. Have apptd internal Cttee in F.O. to see where we cd. economise. But remember tht. R.’s attitude hasn’t helped us to liquidate our commitments.

B.S. Can I have my assessments in first half of ’46.

If our source dries up, can I switch to another?

H.D. Yes.

B.S. Uneconomic transport because of loss of supplies. e.g. from S.E. Europe.

S. Pacific: Can. wanted 4 yr. contract &amp; have gone to end/47. Other Doms. wd. be ready to do more if we gave 2 yr. contracts. Wd. like authy. to make such contracts.

Buying butter in Denmark: against R. comptn.

P.M. Put in memo. on long-term contracts.

No early redn of mil. commitments. Might do it later.

E.B. Don’t agree that all this must be done in 6 months.

Cut down food &amp; you head for biggest industrial trouble ever.

People need more variety of food.

Can’t solve economic problems w’out practical improvisation e.g. switchg. shipping away from U.S. Day to day work on this.

Barnes. Support E.B. Must fight our way out of this. Must however meet H.D.’s need w’in 12 mos. or we shall have another May Report!

Finance: trade: Foreign Policy &amp; defence are the 4 heads.

R.S.C. The export orders are there, if we cd. make the goods. Hence if it’s true tht. variety of food we. increase prodn we cd. pay for it in 6 months. 5% more prodn in return for £20M in food, &amp; we cd. pay for it in 6 months.

H.D. Spend a certainty in hope of a return. We can’t afford to do that.

P.M. Add £10M to first 6 months – leavg. food total unchanged.

11

Then consider position later. i.e. the certain is increased: the provisional 2nd half year wd. be reduced pro-tem.

Dried Eggs.

Agreed{ 21.000 tons on 2 condns made by C/Exchequer.

[Exit Smith, Wilmot

[Enter Winster

4. Civil Aviation

A. Change of guage. U.S. counter proposal as at III in memo. handed round.

Recommend acceptance, subject to amendmt. proposed.

W. Telegram this a.m. shows U.S. have substantially met us on this point. Read it out.

A.B. Last time we were willing to go not so far. This is dangerous because large no. of smaller aircraft.

W. No: they are limited by ref. to normal carry-on needs.

J. This is satisfactory.

W. All governed by proviso – “regard must be had to local service”.

R.S.C. Also the smaller aircraft service is less reliable for local passengers.

Agreed: Change of gauge.

A. Basis Agreement.

Halifax urged us to allow Agreemt. to be initialled.

Formula suggested as in IV – drafted by J.

W. Read telegram this a.m. U.S. Delegn wonder what lies behind it.

We said stall Dpt. first suggd signing ad referendum.

Concludg. with new formula. This omitted infn to Art III.

A. Art. III must be added.

Agreed: subject to incldg. infn to Art. III.
