H.M.’s proposals = 675.000 t. for G. 1.200.000 for India. U.K.

figures, as quoted.

support of U.S. : &amp; throw whole deficit on G. &amp; India.

B.S. Diff. to assess situation. Agree with P.M.’s estimate of figures.

P.M. Does occasional stoppage of mills involve immed. bread shortage?

Moral leadership – great material cost to us. Must say “no” at some

Rationing = only solution to H.M.’s picture. Will U.K. stand

Insufft. a/c taken of our past efforts.

P.M. Suppose we refuse this – anything to prevent U.S. not sending even

Anything forthcoming for G? Or for India? This is a practical

People we can’t afford to starve = U.K.

P.M. But you said they had no more.

B.S. Now believe they have another 3 m. bushels - &amp; are askg. where to

W’ton.

surrender 200.000 – to be deducted from stock (Sept.)

Tel. 3232 and 3233 give H.M.’s reasons – lose leadership: friendly

B.S. Yes: unless we introduce rationing.

stage to U.S.

for it?

what we rely on now.

issue – we can’t manage on what we’ve got.

E.W. Suppose actual starvation in G. Can’t be wholly U.K. responsibility.

P.M. But if we turn this down &amp; U.S. cut existg. promises – that brings us

to M/F. figure of 142.000 t. which is much worse than 580

less 200.

B.S. In such circs. Canada wd. stand behind us.

send it, to U.K. or U.N.R.R.A.

P.M. Mills argument. U.S. mills are now closing.

B.S. Yes: but ….. anecdote …..

P.M. What happens if a mill has to close?

B.S. Transport diffies to spread over other areas. 201

P.M. We are asked to reduce stocks. Told it may stop some mills. What

deliveries etc.

E.Sh. Mills ques. is incidental – a matter of organisation.

If so, we must accept. What is alternative?

P.M. Are you in better posn if you refuse this?

then is the lowest stock we can run on? Improvising

Vital point is p.3 of 3232 – U.S. only source of supply. Is that true?

We have guarantees re prev. 200.000 + Canad. shortfall.

E.Sh. If we don’t accept this, we shall have in the end to give somethg. fr.

We are now asked in effect to give up our claim to repaymt.

B.S. Fairly good: no figures.

B.S. Read telegram from Harwood. We cdn’t have escaped cut, because

demanded. But will mean more economy at home – esp. because

P.M. Bread with main meals. Stop it in high-class restaurants.

U.K. to Germany &amp; India - &amp; m’while lost support of U.S.A.

P.M. Our estimates rely on repaymt. of 200.000 t. by U.S.

All we give is what on our pessim. estimate we don’t get!

A.B. Has bread consumption fallen?

U.S. have marginal supply. Cdn’t have resisted larger cut if

can’t rely on U.S. deliveries.

P.M. Take a/c of stocks outside M/F. control.

T.W. Farms – complaints fr. farmers who can’t get rid of stocks.

A. There are substantial supplies in stack. Millers dislike English wheat.

c) Alternative sources of supply (i) U.K. wheat in stack.

(ii) increased thrashing in Sept. (iii) Argentine.

Propose urgent enquiries into this.
