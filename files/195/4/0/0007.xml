 C.M. 19(46). 28th February, 1946.

1. Parliament.

Business for next week.

2. Benefits in Kind for School-Children.

E.W. Problem: knew we shan’t be able to provide meals 100% by time

family allowances began to be payable. Recognised that this wd.

provoke demand for cash payments in lieu. This wd. be fatal.

Compromise therefore – continue payment by parents for meals

until wider provns made.

Snag: l.a.’s have assumed 100% grant on this service from time fam.

allces began. They know we must pay 100% grant when the

meals are free.

Problem therefore is interim period.

L.a.’s convinced tht. 100% grant ought to be paid &amp; will be paid

eventually.

They are therefore hanging back with expansion until 100% grant is

available.

I have no power to compel them save for poor children’s meals &amp;

meals for wh. parents pay. – i.e. gap is parents who can pay and

don’t.

It is to Ty. advantage to get this provided quickly to avoid pressure for

cash.

I was asked to consider wht. we are doing to secure economy.

a) Accommodn - to plans appd by M/Food.

b) Food – prices fixed: quantities acc. to appd menus.

c) Wages – acc. to scales appd in joint negotn. Excess wd. be

disallowed by auditors.

d) Fuel – consultn with M/F &amp; P.

Ty. referred us to A.R.P. catering. Not, however, good analogy.

Our Insprs. carefully check the accounts.

J.W. Ditto. for Scotland. Save tht. we were behind E &amp; W. when Coaln

Govt. decision taken. This was new service for most l.a.’s in

Scotland &amp; they grumble at not getting 100% grant.

H.D. Just as eager to get this service going. But uneasy at unwillingness

of l.a.’s to go ahead w’out 100% grant. They will go ca’canny

on other things too &amp; we can’t carry all local Govt. on 100%

basis &amp; let them continue to masquerade as indep. elected

authies.

Whole of financial relns with l.a.’s will soon be reviewed - &amp; I’m

disposed to think Block Grant will have to be confined to

poorer authies. Don’t m’while get too much 100%.

I don’t accept posn that we shall eventually have to pay 100%.

44

Can’t decide ques. on basis tht. unless l.a.’s get 100% grant they won’t

do the job they were elected to do.

It is admitted tht. advantage of this to poorer l.a.’s is v. small. They

already get 95%. The major part of this will go to richer authies.

Remember they get 100% already on capital expendre.

Incompetence &amp; inefficiency in staffing etc. Had thought a more

intensive &amp; far-reachg. investign was to be undertaken. That shd.

come first.

M’while they shd. receive existg. grant. And we shd. reserve future

grant for later decision.

P.M. Prev. argument in Cab. was 5/= or 8/=. Our argument was – better in

kind. Didn’t think we were intendg. to put any of it on l.a.’s.

I wd. have assumed therefore whole cost was to be borne by

Exchequer.

C.E. I had a talk with you (as L.P.) when I was at B/E. because thought

some people wanted to put cost of social insurance on rates.

We at D/Ed. always thght. no part of this shd. go on rates. If

whole 8/= had bn. fixed no one wd. have sought to put any of

rates.

Found that because of overheads etc., this service wd. cost more than

the 5/= cash.

L.a.’s will look at this as part of insurance system &amp; as such to be

paid by State.

J. I also was in on this ques. Argument was: 8/= wd. have bn. paid by

State. Then said: some check on extravagant adminn by

l.a.’s. (J.A.) Compromise: 100% on capital expendre: current

expenditure no decision – and all were to avoid committing

themselves.

H.D. Quoted in support section 2 of App. A. of C.P.(46) 74.

P.M. Agree W. Paper left it open.

H.M. Supported J.’s recollection. Was handled in Parlt. in non-committal

way. B/Ed. were invited to find supportg. evce for their view –

&amp; this App. is all they can find. And statement by me on 18.2.43

is conclusive: for M/H. doesn’t even claim 100% for maternity

etc.

A.B. Bound to be drastic review of fin. relns betwn. l.a.’s and Govt.

But no doubt what public think about this. Background: Bev.

recommended 8/=. In first debate: Govt. spokesmen said part

of this (i.e. paymt. wh. wd. have bn. made by State) is better paid

in kind. L.a.’s have bn. silent therefore they assumed whole cost

wd. be carried by Exchequer.

45

No doubt what the assumed understanding was.

Not a ques. of what Govt. intended to convey: it’s a ques. what impn

was conveyed.

P.M. Quotation from Butler suggests paymt. by State. What did he mean

by “we”.

H.M. His instructns were “the community.”

A.B. The concession wd. cost nothing. If you make l.a.’s pay part, you will

have to pay out of yr. rate equalisation grant. For cost of new

educational services is so heavy tht. it can’t be met unless the

Block Grant is used as rate equalisation grant.

T.W. Seems to be common ground then wd. be 100% grant from 1948.

H.D. No: I say tht. it need not necessarily start at all.

E.Sh. Ques. is then one of principle – shd. whole of this cost ever be borne

by Exchequer. Cdn’t accept that. At some time State must

accept 100% responsibility.

Defect in Ty. case. At some stage he is going to re-adjust relns betwn.

l.a.’s &amp; Govt. He can then recoup himself for any loss on this.

If you don’t pay 100% some l.a.’s will hold back - &amp; you won’t get

scheme running by ’48. If therefore C/E. can recoup later, why

not pay?

A.G. Fam. allce scheme was envisaged as national. Govt. rightly split it

into cash and kind. Reasonable assumptn that kind wd. be carried

by State.

H.M. Much experience of negotns with l.a.’s – on both sides.

I have never claimed 100% for anything but Civil Defence. That was

our best case &amp; we never got it. I am opposed in principle to

100% paymt. for l.a. services. You can’t hold the extravagance –

it is diff. enough at 75%.

E.W. first argued at L.P. Cttee tht. we had promised 100% grants.

Asked to produce evce: and this is all she can find. It is clear

tht. we were keeping it open.

Then she says – pressure in Parlt. It’s the job of Ministers to resist

that?

Then tht. l.a.’s won’t play. What is M/Ed. for, with its new power

of dirn? Yield to this &amp; you put Govt. at mercy of l.a.’s.

This is a slippery slope. Why aren’t mat. &amp; child-welfare services

on same basis? They were in same posn as “Kind”.

What was our attitude in Bev. Debate? There are existg. social

services for children &amp; we will see they are developed. Where

do we get to if we admit 100% for any service for children.

100% grant is bad in principle – for local Govt. and State.

What is even more worrying is reluctance to w’stand l.a. pressures.

46

P.M. Agree with general principles suggd by H.M.

But we have to remember public impression. Emphasis was on meals

&amp; we had to say “free to parents”. Reasonable assumption

therefore that State not l.a. wd. pay. We shall be charged with

running away &amp; seeking to put it on l.a.’s.

Prepd to stand up to Parlt. and l.a.’s – but is this a good issue on wh.

to fight.

E.W. I have no power to w’hold grant fr. l.a. for not providing meals wh.

they weren’t obliged to provide – i.e. the gap they won’t fill.

J.W. This is an exception to H.M.’s general principles.

A.B. Can we agree tht. here it is politically impracticable to avoid 100%

x/ grant on this provided that a special scheme is made to secure

economy.

A. Support H.M. Think tht. RAB.’s quote is groggy: but hope still we

will resist 100% grant. You’ll never be able to control excessive

expenditure on 100% basis.

Take a stand on this. Tell l.a.’s frankly 100% grant is wrong in

principle.

A.V.A. On my past experience in local govt. can’t believe l.a. wd. expect to

get a final settlement at 100%.

Gather Cab. accept principle tht. 100% grant is bad. I shd. hope that

by negotiation we cd. get a cheaper settlement.

S. Neutral.

J.J.L. Not impressed by argument re 100% for air-raid shelters. Shd. be set

aside.

Against 100% grant in principle. L.a.’s rod in pickle – wd. make it easier for totalitarianism to take hold. Support Ty.

P.L. Support M/Edn.

G.A.I. T.U. Confce on Beveridge. We were under impn Govt. wd. give the

other 3/= in kind. Almost commd to it. Inclined to favour x/

above.

E.Sh. If we pay capital cost &amp; food, let them pay staff. Bring them in some

way. Fear control via x/ will be v. difficult.

E.W. But reluctant l.a.’s will then use the teachers!

T.W. Remember l.a. members are demandg. paymt. for services.

V. awkward to pay councillors for administering 100% grants.

P.M. Opinions divided – with slight pre-dominance in support of Ty. view.

47

H.M. Cd. Ty. &amp; Ed. Dpts. examine: if they can prevent extravagance on

the food we might give 100% on that: the danger is in adminn –

staff etc., where we shd. avoid 100%.

P.M. Make sure the 3/= benefits the child: and isn’t offset by rates.

H.D. They will have to pay thro’ taxes.

y/ Am prepd to discuss again with M/Ed. in light of discussion

Agreed: as at y/.

T.W. Warning: increased consumptn of milk by these schemes will

retard the abandonment of rationing.

3. Post-war Fire Service.

C.E. Pledge was – return to L.G. Service. Not to same l.a.’s as pre-war.

N.F.S. had turned out better than anyone thought.

If these pledges not given, I wd. have favoured retentn of N.F.S.

But l.a.’s not in least inclined to release us from our pledges.

Ques. therefore is – to what l.a.’s shall we return it. To go back to

pre-war multiciplicity of small authies wd. not produce

efficiency.

Problem: how to secure efficiency with no power to w’hold grant.

H’to no grant for this service. Essential now to give a grant.

J.W. In Scotland handing back wd. be to 228 authies. Wd. be absurd.

I cd. have carried a N.F.S. But pledged had to be honoured.

Plan therefore to reduce to 55 the no. of fire authies, grouped for

operational purposes into 11 Regions.

Grant is essential to secure efficiency. Tho’ we have not led l.a.’s

to expect any. Amount of grant is matter for negotiation – but

prob. about 50%.

T.W. Wd. H.O. allow inter-county arrangemts. or co/co. boro’ arrangements.

C.E. Mutual aid arrangemts. throughout the Country.

H.D. Need for caution. Percentage grant suggd – for all authies. Gather

l.a.’s will ask for not less than 50% That is untenable.

L.A.’s who have no financial need come in under this formula

&amp; get more than they need.

Agree tht. Exch. shd. help. But not on percentage basis: on basis of

grant to aid only cases of need.

C.E. L.a.’s have asked for 50%, on basis of Police grant. Have given them

no encouragemt. and don’t believe 50% is necessary. 20%

overall shd. be enough. But must be overall i.e. some to all if

I am to have disciplinary control.

48

A.B. a) Hope H.O. will resist non co. boros. comg. in.

C.E. Yes.

A.B. b) Don’t prejudice main financial negotns with l.a.’s by starting

a new grant-aided service, which pays somethg. to

richer authies.

Consider in relation to general financial problem.

E.Sh. L.a.’s may want this back. But do the public?

P.M. Can’t cut into l.a.’s further, on this too, after these pledges.

H.M. Consequences on l.a.’s of various changes.

Grant. This never was grant-aided. But how can H.O. control

efficiency unless he makes a grant. And for that purpose it

must be a percentage grant.

Legn can’t come in until next Session. Discuss ques. of grant before

you make announcemt. Be firm.

C.E. Must make some announcemt. to l.a. associations.

E.Sh. We shd. first consider what is future function of local govt. We go on

pre-judging it by piece-meal decisions.

P.M. Does anyone else think you cd. hold N.F.S. against l.a.’s.

J.W. I cd. in Scotland: but I won’t do so against the pledges.

Agreed as in memo: but no decision on grant (discns still procdg).

4. Financial Negotiations in Ottawa.

H.D. As in memo.

Para. 6 (a) and (b) – fractionally better for us in money &amp; gets rid of

1942 loan.

(c) - merges A.T. Scheme with the rest.

Beech 33 from Eady indicates tht. Canadians wdn’t have the

alternative.

Now therefore advise Cab. to close with offer in para. 3.

Advantages: £281 m. cash in a tight period: A.T. Scheme wiped

away.

Old loan – awkward: but must accept.

Effect on U.S. Loan. If this broke down with Canada, wd. be

prejudicial to success of U.S. Loan. Settlement of this wd. be

somewhat helpful.

H.M. Canad. Govt. wd. be friendly. Trouble is Quebec. Had hoped

Canada wd. do somethg. v. much better than U.S.

49

P.L. Strongly support acceptance. This is substantially more generous

than U.S., specially the A.T. Scheme.

A.V.A. And indicate gratitude. Recall the 1 bill. dollar gift. And Canada’s

popn = 12 m. vice 120 m. in U.S.

How is amortisation scheme workg? Forced sales of C. securities.

H.D. No forced sales. If they are sold, proceeds are earmarked v. the loan.

Agreed: accept. [Enter Barnes

5. Future Use of “Queen Elizabeth”.

H.M. As in B.’s memo.

B. Seen Percy Bates: can assure Cab. tht. labour &amp; materials will be

v. little because 90% of equipmt. &amp; fittings were available

before liner was requisitioned. Her equipmt. is in fact on

simpler scale than Q. Mary. Fewer shops etc.

Can it be adjusted to p-war demand. The cabin &amp; 3rd can be

interchangeable to substantial extent acc. to demand.

Much of the labour wd. be used whatever the plan adopted.

A. Australians (H. Comms) concerned: 2.500 women &amp; chil. wantg. to go to Austr.

Want assurce removal of Q.El. won’t reduce amount of shipping

available for that. Want them to have those assurances, thro’

B. &amp; me, before public announcement made.

B. Have seen Beazly. 1.000 wd. brk. back of their problem. And I can

do it in March.

P.M. Announcemt. to be cleared with Service Dpts. }

} H.M. to co-ordinate

S. Want to send Demob. Forms in advance to }

forestall trouble.

J.J.L. Will available shipping cover increased p’mmes due to latest

redns in Serv. strengths.

B. Yes: to the extent that requiremts. have bn. notified to M/W.T.

W’drawal of Q.E. doesn’t affect shipping for India.

{Exit Barnes.

Enter McN., C.J., N.B.

6. Treaty with Trans. Jordan.

C.J. As in memo. Tried to keep w’in spirit of charter.

50

N.B. F.O. are satisfied.

A.B. Art. 4 assumes U.N.O. has broken down.

McN. No. It conforms to Art. 55 of U.N. Charter.

If we don’t have mil. alliance we shall make her independence look

v. odd.

P.M. Art. 4 is a local arrangemt.

N.B. After failure of Art. 3., Sec. Council takes on: but if attack m’while

Art. 4 comes in, in complete conformity with provns of

U.N. Charter.

J. Omit words in [ ] fr. Art. 4.

C.J. Essence for Emir is mil. conventn &amp; promise of aid.

McN. Removes reason for mil. Convention. Then Emir not interested in

Treaty.

P.M. Two separate situations in Art. 4.

N.B. And wording comes from U.N. Charter. Those words are intended

to legitimise such arrangemts. thro’ mil. alliance.

Agreed. [Exit McNeil.

7. Malaya.

C.J. Sultan’s seekg. to go back on their agreemt. And opposn aroused

among more vocal elements in Malaya – also ex-Civil

Servants etc. here.

Thght Cab. shd. be informed.

Objns are to common citizenship (not transfer of jurisdiction) but

we regard that as basic. We therefore recommend tht. Govt.

stands firm on this.

In para. 5(b) we suggest a line of retreat if there’s much opposn in

debate on Straits Settlemt. Bill.

A. Elibank and Marchwood were at back of diffies in H/Lds.

Stand firm.

C.J. There is also informn fr. Malaya of growg. feeling of Malays v.

Indians &amp; Chinese.

Agreed – as in memo. [Exit C.J.

Enter Barnes &amp; Smith.

51

8. World Food Supplies: Proposed Mission to N. America.

H.M. Referred to me onTuesd. No time to get full agreemt. of Dpts

(esp. Ty.) so have put in memo. myself.

Prospect of continuing deterioration.

U.K. doing all in our power: need to get other Govts. to do all they

can.

In particular, want Canada &amp; U.S. to increase acreage.

Proposal: send mission to talk to Govts. &amp; farmers

composn to be settled by P.M.

long-term agreements to buy at fixed price over

no/years.

Urge Ty. to face implicns of not getting sufft. acreage sown.

Might buy on behalf of India &amp; other countries too. But takes time to bring others in. Only 5 wks. to go in N. America. Must

therefore secure our own interest first.

P.M. I will hold over ques. wtr a Minister shd. go: &amp; settle it myself.

Doubt if Minister shd. go &amp; talk to their farmers.

How will it fit in with loan?

H.D. Agree in principle to guaranteed price.

$1.55 is top price now being negotiated with Canada.

Wd. be disturbed by commitments to buy U.S. wheat with dollars.

Where wd. we be if you didn’t get the Loan. And just as bad

to give India dollars with wh. to buy U.S. wheat. Especially

as U.S. price is at least $1.85.

What about Australia. That is where we want supplies fr. Natural

source for India. Sterling cost. And a friendly Dom. Australia

shd. feed India: and problem of payment fr. India’s sterling

balance is v. easy.

B.S. You will only get wheat by price.

Australian &amp; Can. prices are 3 times higher than pre-war. This shd.

be incentive enough. Agreed to take all Can. wheat we can at

$1.55 up to end/47: &amp; wdn’t fall below $1 for 4 years

(? not further years).

Other source = Argentine. You cd. get them to grow at this price, if it

were not that maize &amp; rye is at higher price. You shd. get

equalisation or rather adjustment of price relativities.

Canada: dust-bowl fears of M/Ag. wd. have to be overcome.

Australia: less animals if more wheat.

Missions: diffy. is now you wd. be going to free market, not

controlled establmts. Might, however, be worth while to send

someone to impress need for increased acreage – not talking

about contracts.

T.W. Must look after U.K. first. But in shortage many claimants &amp; to

protect our own supplies we must press for increased supplies.

Object in mind was tht. Minister shd. go &amp; talk to Govts. in Canada

52

and U.S. And if thereafter thght. shd. be campaign in support,

we shd. join in it.

Mightn’t be wise to send agric. experts on our own, to address

farmers. Diff. if we acted thro. F.A.O.

P.M. Two points (different) a) appeal on behalf of world.

b) our part in makg. contracts for ourselves.

A.B. If we approach Can. &amp; Aust. on bulk-purchase basis, it will leave 2nd

problem as concertg. with importg. countries to get larger

acreage in U.S.A.

P.L. Awkward to ask India to guarantee purchase: &amp; then say they can’t

pay in dollars.

Point is producers fears in U.S.

Cd. I ask Indian Food Delegn to stay on &amp; join in.

H.D. Initial step – open discussions with Australia, on same basis as

Canada. Agreed.

Discussion on other points adjourned.
