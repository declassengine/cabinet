C.M. 66 (46) 8th July, 1946

1. Council of Foreign Ministers.

P.M. Read E.B.’s latest telegram. Still hung up.

2. Greece. H.D. Shan’t offer him any money. Is that agreed?

A.V.A. You have a fixed date for ending maintce of Gk. Army. There shd. be a

place for scaling down by then. Otherwise Gk pressure on us to

continue.

N.B. H.McN. will see P.M. to-day &amp; get his economic plans. G. will need help

for econ. reconstn. Cd. C/E be symp. twds. Greece getting loans fr.

Export/Import Bank.

H.D. Don’t mind that.

N.B. Gk P.M. to meet no. of Ministers this week. Left-wing Parties have announced will take part in Plebiscite: prob. means measures for fair vote: but doubt whr public order will be maintd. Has got worse in north – because of autonomist movemt. wh. may be supported fr. over frontier. Impress on P.M. therefore need to m’tain order – even-handedly v. Left &amp; Right.

N.B. We’ve advised them to m’tain Army of 10,000 while threats fr. over n. frontier.

J.J.L. From morale angle we want to get our troops out.

3. Cyprus. P.M. We’ve never decided to cede Cyprus. What is F.O. view.

N.B. E.B. wants discn p’poned. F.O. view think any decln this wk. wd. be a blow

to Tsaldaris’ posn.

G.H. Will be raised in H/C. &amp; somethg. must be said.

H.D. What have we done for, or with, Cyprus since 1878? C.O.S. never say its

any good. Discredit and incubus. Don’t rush to view that this is

desirable posn.

G.H. If P.M. refers to Cyprus, hope firm tone will be adopted.

277

G.H. There is a reply to that case: but we aren’t discussing merits. E.B. doesn’t want Cyprus ceded to Greece: but wants to choose an opportune time to say so.

G.H. And I will try to agree with F.O. on some formula for use. }

P.M. Stand pat: if ques. raised, say hasn’t bn. considered.

N.B. E.B. thinks it wd. be embarrassing if this issue raised in H/C. before P. Confce.

P.M. See the main M.P.’s. &amp; urge them to lay off. }

} Agreed

4. Palestine.

P.M. F.O. telegrams suggesting issue of statement with a view to influencg. Loan discns.

G.H. Doubt if this will do any good. Doesn’t meet Zionist view: they will be cynical about it. Hope to receive fr. H. Comms. statement about ending of B. action then. Wd. rather wait for that.

N.B. We don’t think much of this. Attach more importce to W’ton tells. re publn of the evidce connectg. Agency with Hagana. P.M. Have asked C.O. for memo. on this. Now told we must be careful how we

use this informn. Want it this week.

H.M. I raised the ques. whr. the evidence for it cd. be used. And they were

doubtful.

P.M. Statement shd. include supportg. evidce collected in the raid.

I asked if this informn cd. be used in debate. Imposs. to deny this now, when I have used it.

x/ I will meet C.O. &amp; M.L.S. officials with a view to getting statement out before Loan Debate concluded.

H.M. You won’t get it out until near the end - &amp; can’t tell which way it will go.

H.D. Don’t believe it will. Wd. p’pone it until after the Loan debate.

N.B. Wdn’t issue anything after Debate has begun. And can’t get anything out this p.m.

P.M. Only thing that wd. swing opinion wd. be promise over the 100,000.

G.H. Factual statement re end of H.C.’s action in Pal. wd. be better.

Generally agreed.

278

A.V.A. Plus statement re earlier arrival of Grady’s team.

Generally agreed.

J. And issue here (H/C) vice Washington.

H.M. Let H.C. announce it even earlier.

Leave it until some news announcement can be made.

E.W. Cd. we not use “Zionist” vice “Jew”.

Generally welcomed.

Confirmed decision re Parly. missions.

P.M. Illegal immigration – must be considered v. soon. Prob. Thursday.

5. Austria: Russian Seizure of Property.

N.B. R. seizing property in Austria as being German. Genl. M. Cain has replied tht. G. assets shd. be defined as follows – quote.

Suggest we support U.S. view: encourage Austria to resist: press for earlier discn in Paris.

[Exit OS

[Enter W. &amp; Barnes

6. Civil Aviation.

A.G. L. Boyd amendment re M.P. not being on Board.

Agreed: resist amendment.

7. Petrol Rationing.

E.Sh. As in memo. regarding representns made.

Stocks ample to enable us to meet all demands with restns removed.

Consumptn of goods vehicles is now 85% &amp; p. service vehicles 93% of pre-war.

But that conceals higher consumptn by old vehicles – prs. 15-20%.

Financial implications – as in memo. $50M in a full year.

Won’t be poss. anyway to m’tain present posn for long. And adminly imposs. to relax, rather than abolish restns. 30,000 comm. travellers recievg. suppl. We deal with these demands (e.g. farmers etc.) by staggering appln dates. If we gave a genl. relaxn (as suggested in alternatives) cdn’t do that &amp; wd. need much larger staff. We therefore prefer total abolition. 279

Pressure fr. Doms. Had to compromise in N.Z. – discussg. with Austr. – in S. Africa total abolition of rationg. already.

Cd. be self-sufficient on sterling oil. But that is now our highest export &amp; we must m’tain that market: sometimes we sell v. hard currencies.

We therefore import dollar oil – for that reason &amp; because of shorter haul.

Wd. relieve pressure on rlways.

B. In general agreement. My chief reason = economy in staff, who are doing little good. We are mtg. main needs of commercial transport.

Wish E.Sh. had consulted my Dpt. on details.

No tanker diffy.

P.M. Is it true there is w’spread evasion? a) will make it awkward to m’tain rigid control of other imports.

b)

c) will knock the car export market. 50% of prodn going abroad

now, by vol. agreement because little demand here for new

cars.

When we last examd we agreed on $1300M p’mme. Provisional, to be

settled later.

Need to avoid too big a relaxn of effort when Loan is thro’.

In all these cases there will be strong pressure for addl. dollar

expenditure.

a)

b) consider, not abolition (i.e. absence of all control), but increase of

basic ration: that doesn’t involve the adminve complicns of

increasing supplements.

J. What about black-market? Corruption etc., but the whole thing in danger of

being a scandal.

E.Sh. Don’t think much of arguments con.

R.S.C. Opposed

tyres: controlled thro’ E. petrol licences. How cd. we then get the tyres to doctors &amp; others who need them. No chance of tyres for other than E. licences until July.

Prefer therefore relaxation to abolition.

H.D. Premature to decide now.

Don’t therefore concede this in advance of general review after Loan.

Priorities: Food: machinery: timber &amp; heavy fuel oil (switch-over from coal).

Can’t give complete freedom for motoring in advance.

Also risk of rising prices because of relaxn of price control in U.S.A.

Don’t want to exclude this as middle-distance project.

Suggest

consider as part of general review.

T.W. Those who want to pay can get all they want.

Nothing in R.S.C. point. c). Order books are full.

280

R.S.C. (c) can be met by raising home price. I’m not askg. for unlimited commitmt. Ty. themselves have prepd

estimate of cost.

Price. Partly due to abolition of price control. But export prices turn on world supply: &amp; as there’s no world shortage price won’t rise. We have ample stocks. No one suggests we shd. stop buying dollar oil: &amp; continue rationing. Ty. don’t want it stopped. Not in same posn as food. You can’t get more wheat. You can get petrol.

Timber: can get much fr. Germany: shdn’t need dollars for additional

timber.

Consumption pretty high: but don’t under-estimate the agitation.

Tyres: Reply is: doesn’t follow tht. abolition of petrol control will make that more diff. Wd. rather have our grouse than two.

Private motorist is using tyres now….

How can you m’tain existg. restrns when it’s known we have ample stocks?

That’s main point. I can temporise re Loan. but no more.

H.D. With unlimited demand, your stocks will be exhausted.

E.Sh. That doesn’t meet the point about selling sterling oil.

Petrol rationing is brkg. down – 600 in M/T. 1.000 in M/F &amp; P. employed to

no purpose. Danger of spread to other forms of rationing.

B. I wdn’t use that sort of R.S.C. argument.

Abuse. Of course it’s widespread.

I have really no firm case on wh. to resist pressure. Service argument has gone: for their consumptn has bn. substantially reduced.

P.M. Shdn’t you have reduced importn.

E.Sh. Can we tell Anglo. Persian to reduce prodn in order to bolster up rationing.

B. Discn shows there shd. have bn. inter-Dept. consultn.

Tyres: governed by limitn on use of vehicles.

P.M. Effect on traffic in London.

C.E. People must soon have some reasonable facilities for recreation. Their range at present is v. limited.

Moral as much as material factors must be considered in this regard.

This surely is one restrn that cd. go.

J.S. We cd. get more food with more dollars: not wheat, but variety in diet.

Don’t dissent fr. C.E. views: but wd. wish to have proper priority between various claimants on a general review.

H.D. Million dollars. 1300 total. 450 food. (incldg. 75 for improved variety)

250 for oil p’mme. (assumg. rationg.) 250 raw materials. 175 tobacco 100 machinery 75 for films.

281

A.V.A. Nicely balanced. But what we have to consider is genl. fiscal &amp; economic

posn in 3 yrs. time. V. awkward unless we have m’while

I wd. support view of Ty. &amp; B/T if they have assessed those considns.

H.M. When Loan is thro’, Dpts. will have to make a genl. review.

Food shd. come first.

P.M. Want it reviewed by Ministers concerned.

i) eased situation at end L. Lease.

ii) created good will for export trade. Otherwise, the content will be short-lived; and disillusionment will come 18 mos. before election.

Inconvenient tht. this shd. come alone &amp; direct to Cab.

Shd. be considered interdepartmentally &amp; ? come to L.P. Cttee or other appropriate Cttee. first.

N.B. Not yet out of the wood in Persia.

A. Hope that in the review proposed C.E.’s considns will be prominently kept in mind.

H.D. Cttee – shd. be Ec. Planning Cttee cf. earlier C.M. discns.

P.M. What propn does actual consumptn bear to what it shd. be on ration. Can’t this be ascertained, as check on allegation re black market. E.Sh. What do I say re this on Thursday’s adjournment?

8. Social Survey.

No answer.

[Exit N.B: Barnes: W. M/H was converted.

R.S.C. Confidential nature of some enquiries – better not entrusted to outside firms.

H.M. B/T. willing to come over to C.O.I. in the end. M/F. may find it more difficult.

Ty. not only concur but advocate. Keep watch on expendre. Review in 2 yrs.

H.D. My advisers think this is more economical. I am more sceptical than they.

A.V.A. Why not use commercial firms?

H.M. M/F use them &amp; spend more. Believe that wd. be more expensive.

Memo approved.
