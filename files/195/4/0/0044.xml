C.M. 56 (46) 6th June, 1946

1. Parliament

Business for next week

2. India

E.B. Shd M/L. enquire attitude of demob. men to returg. to India?

E.B. V. well – it’s political: but keep it in mind.

E.B. Para. 8. Support for higher priority for women &amp; children.

J.J.L. Use discretion because of delaying men’s return.

P.M. C.O.S. won’t be ready until Tuesd. No use therefore to meet Friday. Propose to send telegram giving preliminary reactions of Cabinet. Draft handed round.

P.M. Too early for that. And C.O.S. will have it in mind.

J.J.L. It’s clear already tht. the men didn’t think it worth while being there.

J. Let C.O.S. be reminded of it.

3. Germany: Administration of British Zone.

[Exit A.H. A.G.

[Enter J.B.H., Bilcher

O.H.

H.D. As in memo.

Often troubled by this. Time to bring it formally to notice of Cabinet.

Money – as in memo.

Staff – fear too many: fewer wd. be more efficient: shd. be reviewed.

Cost of mil. occupn – over £100M p.a. Recognise these wd. have to be paid wherever they were. But can’t we use more R.A.F. and less army.

Potsdam – we are being had for mugs: carrying it out while others don’t. Reparations deliveries to R. continuing.

Timber. Since memo. spoken to Roy Robinson, who has recently bn. to G &amp; reported to Ag. Ministers. Our timber is our war potential: we shd. now conserve. But because total failure of our people to get timber out of G. - &amp; I hold Timber Control responsible. Untrue tht. all timber is in U.S. zone.

Ask for a competent probe.

Machine tools &amp; plant: we have taken virtually nothing.

Propose: a) enquiry to reduce B. troops.

b) enquiry into efficiency of Control Commn.

c) enquiry why we don’t collect our money.

237

d) enquiry into timber: failure of own administration.

Accept financial obligation for 1947. Propose, however, grants (civilian) to cease at end/1947.

P.M. Has this bn. brought to O.R.C.? In N. House we are under

J.B.H. This is first suggn of overstaffing at N. House or in Germany. staffed. Long hours. Not long to build up.

All revolves around coal &amp; food. They are using wood for fuel. We shall

never get anything out of G. until we use coal then vice

In Germany, much staff belongs to other Depts. e.g. B.I.O.S. : Timber Control: Finance Divn Investign Branch (Ty. who protested v. recent cut in its staff):

Billing of a/c. I’m not satisfd. But none at all before my office establd. And with Ty. concurrence no bills sent out until Apl. Why does H.D. assume further delays.

Pressing fwd. now with Germanisation. 304 B. v. 3.000 G. on timber.

I never said no timber in B. zone. Recently got Balts fr. d.p. camps to work on timber. Lenanton satisfd at pace. But can’t get full days work on low rations. Timber now comg. out at rate wh. will enable us to reach our target by end/year – overtaking arrears. export.

P.M. Allocations quadripartite?

J.B.H. Yes. But are we ready to say no coal for France?

Unilateral deliveries. Suggd at O.R.C. tht. we shd. take what we wanted. Was agreed 15/5 shd. be date by wh. we shd. have finished our removals. But found impracticable. Because need to observe quadripartite agreemts. Recently reached new understandg. on this. Potsdam is what prevents us fr. bldg. up sound economy &amp; prevents positive

policy.

J.B.H. Diff. to establish w’out searchg. enquiry.

Staffing. Reg. Comms. sent out: task to transfer to Germany: intend to confer with them soon.

P.M. In Germany – suggd too many indifferent offls. Fewer &amp; better?

We are getting results in work. In goods, can’t expect it w’out coal &amp; food &amp; under Potsdam.

P.M. Classify numbers?

J.B.H. Nor w’out notice.

J.J.L. Wd. welcome redn in B. troops. But that is for C.O.S.

P.M. Examd in Def. Cttee. – who have already cut them below C.O.S. minimum. 238

E.Sh. My source of infon re coal was E.C.O. &amp; went therefore to enquire myself. But in fact coal runs thro’ whole economy. Have reported to P.M. &amp; will prepare full report for Cabinet.

Agree with H.D. re timber: understatement. a) Quadrit. system hangs like a mill-stone round B. adminn. Ques: not in

this right. But: is this in acc. with Potsdam?

b)

c)

E.B. Basis of set-up was we shdn’t. get anythg. out of G. in 1st year. We foresaw

all thes diffies. All comes back to Potsdam. But if you are going for

self-supporting basis, you must face a def. break with Russia.

Watch India too. Can’t ignore infiltration twds. Afghanistan. If we flout R.

over Potsdam, their counter-stroke might be re. India. We are

vulnerable.

Adminn in G. After C.F.M. Ldn. I spoke to D.H. : and Ty are to blame if it

hasn’t be investigated. Byrnes has spoken to me &amp; suggd top-heavy B.

No civil adminn as such. Civil offls. subordinated to mil. command centred in Dept. Govt. Quality of civil personnel is v. poor – in ability &amp; in personal character too.

Coal. N.G. Coal Commn obsessed with need to meet Fr. demands, w’out regard to adverse effect of high exports. I suggd moratorium on coal experts.

Miners want food: for food processing coal is needed: can’t get coal w’out coal accessory machinery: can’t get tht. because no steel: &amp; no steel because no coal. No tyres because no coal to run synthetic rubber plants. Yet thousands of unemployed: reservoir untapped.

No improvement, thro’ examn of officials, until Potsdam mill-stone removed. Believe few good offls. cd. run the show better – thro’ Germans. Tho’ diffy. over de. nazification policy.

Finance. Our people are living v. well out there. Not good for morale.

Timber. Lenanton v. good – 10,000 t. exported. 11/4M. by end/year. But only if quadripartite set-up doesn’t trip him up. Use of d.p.’s – they are afraid of using them because crim. tendencies. Masses of trees. D.p.’s our policy shd. be work or starve.

We shd. have known more of what is going on in Germany.

Exports of coal to France. If we are going to get B. zone right, we must refuse exports to France. For 6 mos. we must plough it back into B. zone.

We all know tht. R. havg. got agreemts, become inflexible: &amp; hold up action on A.C.C. Berlin.

France. Dead easy to say send no coal. And if you hadn’t R. propaganda in Fr. wd. have given you Comm. France. How wd. you join like that? How wd. H.D. if he were at F.O. What price is it worth to avoid having R. on Channel Ports?

Thus, I wd. be reluctant to break. And wd. rather R. made the break. She may – now U.S. have refused to deliver plant. Wd. sooner U.S. had a row with R. than tht. we opened it. Why haven’t I asked Cab. to follow suit? Fears of “ganging up”. Thght. it wiser to wait until C.F.M. If then no soln of econ. unity of G., I will come in with Byrnes.

Haven’t had time to submit memo. 239

administration. We have a right to Ty. criticism: help on such a thing

as form of B. administration.

Wd. you say I was wise if I’d stopped export of coal to Belg., Holl. &amp; Fr. I

thght. their re-creation was more urgent &amp; import. than Germany. Do

you dissent? Cdn’t have done both. Alphand says G. plants have more

coal than Fr. Their complaint re us is tht. we are too tender to

Germans, in our methods: they say because we are wrkg. thro’

military.

If we had what H.D. wants, we shd. have violated Potsdam.

Crisis is near. Are you wise to change until we see outcome of C.F.M.? But we shd. work out 2 plans a) assumg. defiance of 4-Power control when it involves us in expenditure over &amp; above what G. can pay. That is if Potsdam stands.

b) a complete break with Potsdam. But that means irrevocable partition of Germany &amp; Commn fr. Trieste to Stettin. Will H.D. take responsibility for that?

This is what H.M.G. have bn. trying to avoid all along.

O.R.C. You gave us only policy – not adminn, wh. came under C. office. Thus no avoidance of its responsibilities.

But am willing to see O.R.C. strengthened. Wd. like to see E.Sh. on it: also other Ministers with staff out there. If O.R.C. had progress rpts &amp; task of co-ordinating &amp; overseeing adminn, it wd. help me at F.O. Wd. like more informn re day-to-day diffies. Often M &amp; Byrnes know more than I do. Then I wd. prob. need another Parly. Secy.

J.B.H. has done well. But need help. Believe he wd. welcome it. Shortage of good staff.

In general, reconstitution of O.R.C. as in brief. M/Supply &amp; M/T. are affected too. P.M. M/Food also.

Food: Coaln Govt. misled by Cherwell.

F.O. memo in prepn now. Let both go to enlarged O.R.C.

P.M. Right course – reconstruct O.R.C. J.B.H. has had diff. job. Needs support of colleagues. Some of complaints are not v. him.

I will consider composn &amp; t. of r. On wider issue: wait, as E.B. says, until after Paris.

H.M. R. are puttg. own interpretn on Potsdam.

Prs. unwise to challenge P. as such.

But R. aren’t complying – on economic unity principles. Econ. Compns must come in as well as foreign policy.

E.B. Haven’t they?

H.M. No.

E.B. Liar. If O.R.C. can do it, well &amp; good. Had wondered whr. E.Sh. cd. enquire into coal ques.

P.M. Will consider how to organise continuous supervision and support for J.B.H. by colleagues who must be Cab. Ministers.

240

H.D. Content tht. my memo. shd. go to new O.R.C. Hope all Dpts concerned will be on it. Must have prompt informn.

[Enter Dugdale

[ Exit Belcher

4. Despatch of Families to B.A.O.R.

P.M. What about this latest unauthorised Press rpt.

E.Sh. Varying views in Br. zone. Not keen on it in Ruhr. Elsewhere favour it.

J.J.L. Men had heard about it. Press were troubling: A.G. authd statemt. tht. machinery was ready when Cab. decided. Told him to have corrn issued of Herald story.

J.B.H. B.A.O.R. disclosure. Col. Jackson, Rhine Army.

P.M. W.O. to make written rpt to me.

Figures: 10,000 wives &amp; 15.000 children.

E.W. Dissent. Think it a mistake to send the children: also don’t want to spare the teachers. Expensive scheme &amp; doubt if its worth it.

H.M. Parly. Secretary agreed. with this.

J.J.L. I won’t rush this merely because of pressure from the men.

Bound up with future of B. adminn. No need to let them go out until decided how we are going to administer the zone.

Food &amp; accommodation for 25.000 is not inconsiderable.

P.M. Folly to begin it at once. Plan &amp; prepare.

Dugd. As in Malta &amp; Gib. where they can go out only as housing is available.

J.B.H. Housing is there.

P.M. Be careful &amp; go slowly. Promise nothing earlier than August.

After discussion: Agreed remit to O.R.C. (new style)

[Exit Dugdale

5. Repatriation of Soviet Citizens.

E.B. As in memo.

This will bring us into line with U.S.

241

P.M. A.E. signed on behalf of Doms. also. Asked for views of Doms.

A. Don’t believe any are directly involved. Want few more days to verify.

Agree it, subject to that.

J.B.H. “R. attitude has softened.” But recent signal re removal of B. dead.

In general, welcome the policy: but hope E.B. will query inclusion of Todt workers. Also want Sov. informed before we put it into opn.

E.B. Will of course inform M. But intention of Todt workers – why keep these bouches inutiles.

J.B.H. Forceful repatn lead to suicides. B. troops don’t like that.

Don’t want to be more tender than U.S.

Agreed: memo.
