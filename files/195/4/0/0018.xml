A.B. Will Health Bill be taken week after next.

H.M. Aimg. to complete Cttee Stage by 4/7. Opposn askg. for longer interval before 2nd Rdg. of Bills.

We are pressing them on 4/7 basis – whr 2nd R. before or after Easter.

A.B. Want 2nd R. before Easter.

H.M. No diffy about time – it’s ques. of handling Opposition.

[Exit W.W.

Leakage of Information.

A.B. Parly. Labour Party Mtg y’day – remark made by me reported in Ev.

Standard.

Said at opening M.P.’s approached for paras. on payment.

V. serious breach of payment.

P.M. Mention at next Party Meeting – stringently.

[4. Iron &amp; Steel Industry.]

P.M. Leakage: in “Times”.

J.

E.B. Observer leak on Ruhr problem.

Formal investign into simultaneous leakages?

P.M. Never get anywhere with that.

108

Let Jowett enquire into these.

[Enter J.W. 4. Future of iron &amp; Steel Industry.

An early decision - &amp; announcement – essential + financial arrangemts. to

ensure that 3 most urgent development schemes can proceed w’out

delay.

H.D. Important to decide &amp; announce – but no commitment whr. we take it next

Session or followg. No promise yet given when we will proceed with

electricity or gas.

J.W. As in memo. Recommend natn of central core – as Minister responsible for Supply, but recognise that there are wider concns for Cab. e.g. because will involve v. complex v. diff. tasks.

P.M. First consider timing. Danger of overloadg. machine. After legn comes adminn. Coal – insurance – transport – gas &amp; electricity. Risk of break-down of adminn machine if this Bill taken into 2nd Session. On that ground favour takg. this in 3rd Session. Tho’ that raises diff. ques of preventg. stagnation.

H.M. From Parly. angle I wd. prefer 3rd Session.. But then must find a satisfy. means of ensuring that development continues.

Finance – discussed with Catto &amp; Hyndley. We can find the money. If we take a firm line, the industry may be co-operation. The 3 big schemes are ready to proceed. R. Thomas wd. like to go ahead. Believe Colville scheme for Scotland is ready too. – and Dorman Long on Tees-side. Think Govt. shd. help with the money.

E.B. To avoid stagnation – Any reason v. apptg. now a strong Control Board? Process by agreement on Fedn (no powers) v. slow. Unions are ???? about this.

Serious situation in tin-plate – because young men won’t work the old process. Need therefore to get ahead with new strip-mill in S. Wales.

If you announce you will nationalise &amp; tht. m’while you are going to appoint a strong Control Board. – no inconsistency. Risk = stagnation thro’ incompetence not thro’ opposition.

V. good younger men on both sides of this industry.

Even if you went for big Bill in 2nd Session, it wdn’t be thro’ until 1948; and we can’t wait until then.

German p.o.w. cd. lay the site of the new strip. mill. The existg. one at Port Talbot was so built. Or Italians on wages. Or Poles. From man. power pt. of view, gt. advantages.

And thro’ Control Board you may evolve yr. machinery for running a nationalised industry.

A.B. Support E.B.

At Cardiff found vacancies in tin-plate advertd by M/L. The men won’t go into it. 109

E.B. If Control Bd. Establd – v. introduce electrolytic method in tin plate you can save much import of time – 1/21b vice 2lb.

J.W. Wd. take 12 months fr. now to define what you are to take over.

Welcome E.B.’s suggn.

But essential to say we are going to nationalise.

E.Sh. Cd. we not have settled policy before timing or interim arrangemts.

a)

What part of the industry is to be taken over? How provide for severance?

J.W. needs 12 months to define area for natn. That confirms my fears

as expd at Soc, Cttee. Composits undertakgs. – G. Keen &amp; Nethfold

e.g. – producg. also engineering products of various kinds. Had

trouble over severance with coal – which seemed easy.

c) Coking coal – as in memo. Seems to be O.K. for 50 years.

d)

short interval before procedg. to take over. In coal, we provided for

interim period development: but those i/c industry reluctant to

undertake it.

Sound note of caution – as at Socialisation Cttee – formula or incantation “natn” is not enough. Must know what is the scheme.

Conclude = more time to consider what part of industry shd. be natd

b) Coal = indigenous product. R/ways etc., also.

Here, however, dependent on import of raw materials. More diff. therefore to nationalise the industry.

Interim arrangemts. If you make an announcemt. you must have only

Also, uncertainty among employees (esp. higher ranges) who lose all

interest in industry. Has happened in coal. The longer the interim

period the greater the diffy.

Wd. like to see E.B.’s suggn on paper before we decide. e)

Remember you had control system for coal durg. war - &amp; trouble therefore

of control w’out ownership.

Must see the end of the road before we speak about the beginning.

Think we shd. nationalise this in the end. But not same demand for this as for coal.

E.W. There is on Tees.

[Exit H.M.

P.M. Danger about the interval. Must be clear statement of precise &amp; detailed

intention.

Agree there is now stagnation in mines.

E.Sh. Because they assume more emplt.

Agree also with E.Sh. that E.B.’s suggn needs examn.

T.W. Supported E.Sh. – must know what we are going to nationalise.

E.B.’s suggn: wd. Control Bd. be able to proceed with rationalisation while preparing for X/ nationalisation.

Wd. prefer X/ for time being.

110

E.W. Against. No industry made subject of closer investigation for natn. Not a

step in the dark. Wd. request delay beyond next Session. Much work

done; &amp; natn expected.

P.M. No. Point is: must be clear in statement what

J. Supported T.W. In last Govt. I made investign. Duncan did nothing. Wright was hopeless. But agree must be short interval between announcg. &amp; doing.

Wd. therefore prefer a Bd. (to do x/) w’out preliminary promise to nationalise.

Statement shd. not be merely fulfilment of election pledge – but on basis of business like proposition.

A.B. “Diffies” will increase with passage of time. Vertical integration &amp; composite firms will increase. These arguments for p’poning are arguments for never nationalising at all. you are going to take over.

H.D. Further statement in views of E.Sh.’s statement.

Argue to ques. of interim period.

A.B. V. well, I will. The analogy of control w’out ownership in coal durg. war is inapt – because here you will have pledged yourself to Natn.

Wd. accept E.B.’s proposal: but do it quickly.

Definition of area for natn: not so diff. to decide what to say.

Gather J.W. can get better definn if he can discuss with industry on basis tht. central core will be taken over. Essence wd. be tht. we say at once we are going to take that over.

A possible (tho’ inferior) alternative wd. be for J.W. on his own to submit quickly his own definition.

This Govt. can’t funk nationalising this industry, throughout this Parlt.

E.Sh. But J.W. said 12 months to get a complete definition.

J.W. Definition – fairly complete in para. 13. Shorter one para 20. The central core can be easily defined. What will take time is defining exact line of boundary, plant by plant. You can’t get a more precise definition w’out discussions with industry.

H.D. Hope we can decide to-day to make announcemt. includg. definite decision to natn. Stagnation – we’ve got it now.

Development areas. The 3 schemes are in those areas.

Economic power: we don’t begin our Socialist advance until we have collared coal &amp; steel. Public utility stuff wd. be done by a capitalist Govt.

E.B. Capital cost in this industry is so great that I doubt if private enterprise can carry on with it. ???? - £11M. financed at 5-6 1/2%. We must find

111

means of financing steel at around 2%. Even Corby was financed at 41/2% - and that is too much.

Argument for this is business, not politics.

With a Control Bd. – why not rest new mills in the Bd. not the companies – publicly owned from the outset. You’ll attract best managers to new plants.

Catto knows this v. well.

Many old firms grew up as family business – but no family in there now &amp; no attraction to outsiders either. Natn only remedy.

No money in the trade for research. We’ve had to buy results of U.S. research.

All Duncan did, under tariff, was to pay dividends to redundant firms.

No announcemt. until interim arrangemts. worked out, after discn with Catto &amp; some members of Steel trade.

P.M. Work out Control Bd.

Announce it: say it will work out natn in detail &amp; carry on m’while with rationalisation.

H.D. May E.B., J.W. and I work our means of announcg. this quickly?

P.M. Yes. Plus Jowitt. To Cab. next week, if possible.

[Exit J.W.

[Enter G.T.

Victory Celebrations: Order of March

C.E. Origins C.O.S. My Cttee doesn’t dissent in principle.

a) Comment. No provn for E.E.B. on dais.

P.M. I talked to him. He is doubtful. Civil Service not represented in March.

He wd. be only civilian save Home Secy. &amp; P.M. &amp; Winston.

Might be others – e.g. other Ministers.

P.M. He feels this is a military affairs.

A.

A.B. Hope Cabinet will be exempted from attendance?

C.E. He held office longer than any Minister.

This = demonstration of country’s effort. Includes civil as well as military side. I suggd a section of housewives. If that is conception, head of Civil Service shd. be there.

G.T. This is only Saluting Base: &amp; room only for 15.

E.B. &amp; A. Supported inclusion of E.E.B.

b) C.O.S. worked this out w’out consultn. 112

I think W.S.C. shd. ride with C.R.A. in first carriage – not in second with Pug.

I shd. go in second carriage. Agreed.

c) C. O.S. have ignored Qu. Mary &amp; other Members of his Family.

6. Council of Four: Publication of Records.

I intend to take H.M. Pleasure.

E.B. What about Diplomatic Corps?

P.M. This is only the dais.

A. d) At least one person [on dais] representg. each Dom. and India.

P.M. They will be behind the dais.

Ministerial Cttee shd. examine all these suggns.

[Exit G.T.

7. Food: Reduction in Cheese Ration

E.B. Propose to agree. Not to consult Italy

Agreed.

P.M. B.S. will announce to-day reduction in cheese ration.

T.W. Ham-handed P.R.O. – talk of more butter etc., when E.E.C.E. confce meets.

E.B. Don’t let B.S. announce this to-day.

General talk of inefficiency of M/Food.
