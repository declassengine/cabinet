C.M. 102(46). 2nd December, 1946.

Germany. Financing of British and U.S. Zones.

A.B. Spoken to E.B. on telephone: convinced he can get no more out

of U.S: wants Cab. decision by 1.p.m. New York time.

Announcement in H/C. Tuesday – I can’t give it because

Some concessions made: particularly on Joint Agency working.

meet us.

dollars we may have to come out of this agreement.

R.S.C. Unfortunate we can’t get our reservations. But alternative of going on

Germans, which it can’t.

Indian talks.

H.D. V. unsatisf. As usual, pushed back by U.S. on Congress argument.

Para. 8 of agreement (para. at end of p.8) goes some way to

List on p.1 of C.P.438. Para. (v) not sufficiently met.

Para. (vii) rejected: I attach importance to this.

Para. 12 – review – is worthless.

Concln: unsatisf: may be best we can get: must leave discretion to

E.B.: but we must go on record - ? in personal lr. to Byrnes –

makg. it clear tht. our ability to honour this depends on our dollar

posn: diffies of that explained: and if we get into real trouble over

alone will land us in worse diffies. If Agency does its work well,

may save much of the 500 m. expendre in dollars.

A.V.A. E.B. has done well. “Congress” argument is v. troublesome.

Readiness to exchange Zones shows how dangerous U.S. posn was.

Agree we shd. go on record.

R.S.C. But not for publn to Congress.

A.B. Who will run Ruhr industries – 2 C’s-in-C: Germans: or who?

E.B. says expedite socialisation. But joint econ. adminn as from 1.1.47.

Can’t U.S. then stop socialisation – unless more comes fr.

R.S.C. Nothg. in document which alters control in either Zone. The joint

economic machinery is only for pooling economic resources &amp;

supply.

A.B. Is there nothing in this wh. will prevent us fr. going on with

socialisation.

If nothing, then add a note declaring our intentn of going on with it.

Otherwise, nothing but misunderstanding or friction.

E.Sh. Asked to decide fate of Europe by 1.p.m.

Fusion of 2 Zones means tht. each Govt. will have some right, at some

stage, to comment on adminn of other’s Zone. 424

Our policy was: econ. integration of all G. This, to some extent,

closes the door to that. The door is still open now. This slams

more than short-term diffy: prs. only 6 months.

A. Ruhr. We can provoke move fr. G side.

it in R. face.

A.V.A. Faces R. with fait accompli.

McN. What about the preamble to the Agreement?

E.Sh. Some of us objected to Loan because diffies: told no alternative.

Same again here.

In the end we shall be completely under U.S. economic domination.

Acute problem = food. That is costing dollars. Don’t believe that is

U.S. sooner or later must sell. May have to cut prices. Will then be

able to get more food out of U.S. U.S. must find markets.

P.M. How survive next 6 months?

E.Sh. We’ve done so up to now. Is it suggd tht. if we reject this U.S. will

cut off supplies?

P.M. They mayn’t say so: they wd. do it.

E.Sh. Re-actions in H/C. Will our supporters take this?

If U.S. finance &amp; German organn gets going, formidable competn

to B. exports in a few yrs. Better run our own show.

Annual review. Can’t we have provn to terminate after notice of

x months if our dollar posn becomes too severe?

Don’t agree with E.Sh. Fusion shd. make it easier to reach agreemt.

with R. about G. being treated as a whole. Shd. strengthen our

bargaining posn.

P.M. We are criticised re posn in G. Our defence: bound by quadrip.

agreemt: as can’t get it treated as whole, have chosen 2nd altern.

of fusion with U.S. Zone.

What alternatives now. Exchange &amp; w’drawal are imposs. Remains:

carry on alone. Must consider immediate winter: not 6 mos.

ahead. Wd. like to go on alone, but haven’t the resources.

J.B.H. Agree with E.Sh. on long-term. But immed., we have no food after

end of Dec. Rejn of this plan wd. make U.S. v. reluctant to give

us supplies.

J. V. obscure draft. – particularly para. 12.

But right to w’draw implied in para.12 of agreement.

A.B. Partnership with U.S. means domination by U.S. Because they have

the resources &amp; we haven’t.

425

We shall have estranged E. Europe thereby.

Alternative: tell U.S. we sign on basis tht. it imposes no obligns on us

reg. our treatment of G. industry in our Zone. We can argue tht.

U.S. reluctance to accept this means U.S. willingness to leave G. industry with Krupps. We can force public admn of this.

A.B. Pressed for statement to U.S. re

Stop this U.S. blackmail.

P.M. We are in moneylenders’ hands. Face that.

Folly to suggest tht. we don’t want U.S. collaboration in reconstn of

Europe.

State: internal adminn of industry in each Zone will remain under

control of each Govt.

McN. My advisers confirm tht. this gives no power of veto to U.S. Govt. on

internal adminn of B. Zone. Ruhr.

R.S.C. Don’t limit it to dollar resources. The agreemt. must be ended if Fr. or

H.M. Pros. and cons. From brief.

P.M. Say to E.B. Ques. in H/C. We will reply: a) we remain free to

develop our policy re control of industries. b) Duration. Open to

review at yearly intervals: &amp; if we find dollar burden

intolerable we shall have to w’draw.

J. Suggested a formula.

Sov. willing to come in. U.S. can’t deny that.

McN. Cuts both ways. Remember E.B’s argument about U.S. revision of

terms.

H.D. Yes: para. 7 of 2150.

P.M. But it we are going to be better off in 12 mos. that doesn’t apply.

J.S. On food, seller’s market may have ended in 12 mos. Shd. have no

diffy. in gettg. the food – fr. U.S. &amp; Argentine.

H.D. Shd. still have to pay for it.

Ruhr: let E.B. send a letter to Byrnes, both on this &amp; on duration

(dollars).

If this costs us more, we shd. say so in advance.

P.M. Propose letter to Byrnes saying what we shall say in H/C. on Ruhr &amp;

duration.

R.S.C. Put it to Byrnes in writing as notice of what we shall say.

426

H.D. These are our views: say so: may or may not be raised in H/C. Must

be able to say that we have told U.S.

Agreed: Put on record in letter to Byrnes, before signing,

our views on Ruhr and Duration.

Announcement.

P.M. To be made after Ques. on 3/12.

I can’t do it because of Indian conversations.

Invite H.D. to do it.

H.D. Only on basis of E.B.’s absence.

No continuing commitment on me.

Circulate Agreement as White Paper.

A. Simultaneous announcemt. in H/Lds. 427
