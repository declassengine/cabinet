C.M. 94 (46) 4th November, 1946

1. U.N. Indian Complaint v. S. Africa S.A. law on land acquisn: Smuts says “domestic jurisdn ”: A.G. queries that

because of “essentially”. Smut says, then let it go to Internatl Court.

Strongly support our line

P.L. R.S.C. asked for legal issue to be brght to Cab.

Second ques: Indians who aren’t S. A. nationals are also affected by the

legn.

A. Art. 2(7) of Charter – “essentially”.

If we agree this is not “domestic”, we shall be opening door to scrutiny anywhere in Empire – v. dangerous door for us.

Nothing will please India short of support of their case on merits.

If we hesitate, we shall give offence to Dutch nationalists in S. Africa.

P.M. Right line to take to support reference to Court.

S.G. Off hand opinion – this is w’in words about domestic jurisdn.

J. I wd. have thought so too.

Canada is deporting C. born Japanese – Privy Council have upheld their right to do so.

a) m’tain it’s w’in 2 (7)

b) if disputed refer to Court.

A.G. thinks our legal ground isn’t sound - &amp; we’ll be beaten on it.

India will take our attitude v. much amiss. If we’re defeated on it, it will be. v. bad for us.

They are the concern of the Indian Govt.

A.B. Legn discriminating r. one class of citizen is surely a matter for internatl

concern.

Let interpret n of 2 (7) go to Internatl Court.

A.B. Agree that ques. of interpretn of 2(7) shd. go to Internatl Court.

Cabinet are abandoning their internationalism.

H.McN. Intern. Court doesn’t make law, only interprets. Doubt if this shd. go to Court until Human Rights are defined.

S.G. A.G.’s point is apparently inconsistency betwn. 2(7) and 55 of the Charter.

H.D. This ques. shd. be kept out of U.N.O.

C.J. Agreed. In Col. territories there are groups wh. can’t be integrated fully into life of community. It isn’t a ques. of discriminatory legn.

P.M. {We must argue that this is domestic jurisdn

{We must support reference of this, if disputed, to Intern. Court. 388

Agreed

(P.L dissenting) Tell our Delegn what wd. be the repercussions on India &amp; Empire of

opp. Line.

2. War Crimes: Trial of German Industrialists. Danger: if we concede this demand, we may have to surrender, on demand,

to other Zones – on ground that we aren’t trying them ourselves.

We don’t want trials in B. Zone: cdn’t man the Tribunal: our Tribunal wd.

prob. acquit!

A.V.A. Risk of demand from Soviet Zone – for S.P.D. T.U. leaders.

We cd. denounce the agreement. But wd. be said we favoured industrialists.

3. India: Proposed Question in H/Lords.

P.M. German industr. not put on trial at Nuremberg. Ques: shd. they be tried subseqn. by Zonal trials. Our view was against. U.S. have however started such a trial in U.S. Zone &amp; asked us to hand over ½ doz. industrialists now in our Zone.

J. We are bound by Treaty to hand over unless we are going to try ourselves.

J.S. Surrender them – on pooling basis.

J. Then we can try them.

P.M. That wd. be discriminatg. between U.S. and Soviet justice.

x/ Agree to hand these over. But don’t make a decision now that we will in no circs. hold trials in B. Zone. Try to bring these trials to an end.

Agreed at as x/.

P.L. As in Minute to P.M. Private Notice Ques. for Tues. by Ld. Salisbury – not

dissuaded by letter wh. I wrote to him.

Motion for Papers in H/Lds. Awkward if it’s carried.

Discns have bn. lengthy – not all written – 3 sided – many demands put fwd. by all 3 wh. they later had to modify or w’draw. V. undesirable to publish all that. But some publd already in India – e.g. betwn Jinnnah &amp; Congress: Viceroy &amp; Jinnah. Diff. for us to w’hold that here. But if confined to that, wh. is incomplete, demand for full publn will be stimulated.

Cd. say to-morrow we wd. consider: but that wd. only p’pone the issue.

A.V.A. We can’t refuse statement re riots: how far B. troops used. But r Formn of Coalition Govt. in India: same diffies as might be encountered in formg. Coalition Govt. here: v. good reason surely r. publishing such proceedings. The publns made there are matters for Parties there. 389

P.M. What if they carry a Motion for Papers?

Believe they will take it – if we put the issue on A.V.A.’s line.

4.

J. No one knows what happens!

Agreed.

Palestine

C.J. Nothing to add to memo.

Diff. to continue to detain indefinitely. Agency anxious to creep back into co-opn of some kind: we want to rally moderate J. opinion behind Agency. Resoln passed not all we cd. wish: but courageous: supported by speech of

leaders in Pal.

This is favourable moment for us to contribute to restorn of order. Risk tht.

further opportunity mayn’t arise.

Arabs wd. also be released.

Agreed as in memo.

5.

H. Comms. agrees.

Import Programme, 1947

H.M. Introduced memo.: stressed para. 3.

P.M. £17M of films – tho’ no suppl. food &amp; no abolishing of petrol rationing.

M. Films better value than food, throughout the country.

H.M. Not enough B. films to fill the gap. That was B/T. argument. M/H. suggd in earlier discussion change the films once, vice twice, a week.

A.B. The point was that you wdn’t save money – because payment is on basis of %age of cinema takings. Unless you changed that structure, you wdn’t save dollars.

P.M. Let R.S.C. give me a report later.

H.D. The outlook is ugly. Threatens real trouble in 1949, if not earlier. We

shan’t be able to pay our way w’out swinge- ing cuts - &amp; wd. be

hooted off the stage.

i) import p’mme as in para. 18 of App. B. with £10M. more for

food.

ii) export target at 150% of 1938.

a) supply of material to maintain it.

Recommns

Wd. have liked to meet E.Sh. over petrol rationing. Can’t afford it.

Export drive done well, but v. precarious

390

b)

iii) study proposals in para. 12., subject to addn (v) in covering

memo.

And fr. July ’47 sterling will be convertible for current transactions - &amp;

Europ. currencies won’t be. This means a deficit with these countries,

to be met in gold &amp; dollars. &amp; surpluses with e.g. France wh. will be

recognised only as sterling credit.

High level overseas expenditure, mil. &amp; political. As a whole, its too high.

Competition with imports.

M. This is agreed memo. Followg. comments are by of gloss –

b) want import of goods in return for exports. Can’t do it by barter.

Must be thro’ financial control.

c) Wd. it be prudent temporarily to raise external value of £1.

H.D. We are strongly against it.

H.D. Heavy pressure on me to go above £75. Believe this compromise is about

right pro tem. Will watch it.

J. Suggest the public shd. know the facts. The broad picture.

J.S. Prodn value of food imports.

E.Sh. Not as depressing as H.D. suggests.

Overseas expenditure. £320M: and £175M for 1947.

H.D. And ’47 will be higher.

E.Sh. a) How far is dollar expendre to be considered in reln to total. In G.

$160 M are being spent. I only asked for 33M same in Malaya etc.

That expre will diminish - &amp; with it the dollar burden w’in it.

Now derived mainly from shipping. Wd. have thought they might increase.

prices’: how long will a sellers’ market hold.

Total picture: we are buying too much from &amp; not selling enough to N. America, Sweden and Argentine. Gave figures in support.

Must therefore be more direction of export &amp; import trade. viz. recommns in para. 21.

a) deliberate direction of exports wd. be retrograde. We cd. however, guide them to hard currency countries. Some exports to soft countries will bring dividends later.

P.M. Hunt that have bi-laterally.

M. d) Is tourist expenditure more than we can afford? £75 p. head as cpd. with 8d p. head on films.

Vital issue. External posn must be split in 2: sterling &amp; dollars. Only the 2nd is diff: &amp; tht. high prices in U.S. followg. decontrol.

U.S. prices may crack. That reduced the gloom.

Invisible exports. For ’46 £95M: for ’47 £85M. Why? 391

The picture is not therefore so gloomy. On P.7 (para. 6) we shall have £1.500M available to us by end /46.

Petrol. i) considerable evasion. Can’t tighten up the adminn. Can’t

sustain morality of the scheme. The rot may spread throughout the

control system as a whole.

ii) Last time it wasn’t dollars, it was tyres.

30 M dollars isn’t large in this context – you cd. find it by economies of dollar expendre in B. Zone.

No trouble here on tyres: any longer.

iii) wdn’t object to increase in price. Tho’ wdn’t earn any dollars.

P.M. Don’t overlook amount of our petrol exports.

Austr. are now going to abolish rationing. Ask for another 10M galls.

A.B. Suppose scheme deteriorates, when will you reach the $30m.?

[Exit J.W. Marquand.

6. Exchange Control Bill.

E.Sh. It’s our largest export at present. M/E petrol goes to Doms., F/East etc. &amp; earns many dollars.

But even if they can’t get it, they will take a chance on it.

A. S. Africa can afford dollar petrol.

H.M. Why not leave petrol pro tem. But re-examine in light of para. 21 enquiry, esp. 21 (iv). Shdn’t take long.

P.M. True that p. rationing is workg. badly &amp; rot may spread. The sooner we can end it the better.

H.D. Never. For this is a firm p’mme for petrol imports.

Approve p’mme as it stands.

H.D. As in memo.

P.M. Wd. H.D. see legal experts on Opposn.

My answer to S.G. is: this went uncriticised when operated under D.R. during the war.

S.G. Nothing to add to memo.

Thought I shd. draw attentn to stringency: but agree nothg. less wd. do what is needed. As in last para. of memo.

H.D. No: I wd. rather fight it.

392

C.E. Courts may be unwilling to enforce some of these provisions – I said this at L.P. Cttee: but now w’draw it.

J. This is the most drastic Bill ever introduced in peace. But if you agree to

reveal the situation wh. it is designed to melt, v. well.

7.

Advisory Council, on workg. of scheme, in Coal Bill &amp; another. Some analogous procedure wd. help.

H.D. Will consider that – as concession by amendment.

A.B. Popular wicket for H.D. here.

But precede this Bill with publicity for Item 5.

P.L. Make it clear these powers are workg. to-day.

A. Reserve some concessions for H/Lds. Don’t give them all away in H/C.

H.McN. Will H.D. send advance informn to Snyder?

H.D. Arranged.

H.McN. Brief for B.I.S.

H.D. Yes.

[Exit: O.S., H.McN.,

S.G.

[Enter W.W.

Elections: Re-distribution of Seats. 8.

C.E. If approved, I wd. communicate with Boundary Commns &amp; hold up.

P.M. No announcement until Debate on Address.

Agreed.

Remembrance Day Ceremony: Cenotaph.

C.E. Important occasion. New inscriptn will be unveiled.

P.M. Hope as many as possible will attend. De Freitas to represent N.B.
