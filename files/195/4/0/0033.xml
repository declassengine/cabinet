C.M. 45(46). 13th May, 1946.

1. Paris Meeting of Council of Foreign Ministers.

P.M. Rpt. fr. E.B. Things easing up. M. w’drew demand for Tripol. –

ready to give trusteesh. to Italy.

Our pledge to Senussi. E.B. therefore proposed we shd. have

t. over Cyrenaica.

Fiume &amp; Pola shd. go to Yugoslavia. E.B. will agree either to

Crux now: Trieste. R. demandg. it for Yugoslavia – wd. bring iron

curtain down to Adriatic: wd. offend Italy deeply. Agreed

Fr. proposal or to U.S. proposal on Boundary Commn. Or if

suggested by another wd. accept internatl regime in Trieste.

Peace Conference.

M. still takg. the narrow line. Offends Doms. &amp; others. Moscow

decln was ambiguous as incldg. both completion &amp; date.

E.B. wd. prefer to break on Trieste rather than procedure.

A.B. If there is a break, better have it on the Conference point, not Trieste.

Cdn’t get an Ital. Govt. to sign Treaty with R. view of Trieste.

Don’t want to be identified with view that C.F.M. forcing their views

on other countries.

Offence to Doms.

N.B. No more brk-downs on procedure.

H.D. Importance of Treaty with Italy.

Trieste – v. open ques. on the merits. Yugoslav case can’t be

dismissed.

Not a good brkg. point surely.

Austr. took view that Yugosl. shd. have Trieste.

Wdn’t make much diffce to iron curtain. It wd. come down 5 miles behind the port anyhow.

A. This isn’t really procedure – it’s principle. Doms. say belligerents

shd. have a shot at this – can’t dismiss that claim as procedural.

We shd. have wide support, outside C.F.M., for resistg. idea that

C.F.M. decisions are to be rubber-stamped by others.

P.M. E.B. point tht. on Moscow decn M. is prob. right.

J. Trieste. Artery into Austria, Hungary etc., shd. be preserved. Secure

that: sovereignty doesn’t matter much.

N.B. Italy wants early Treaty: but wd. prefer modified Armistice rather than

Treaty giving Trieste to Yugosl.

187

E.B. thinks Byrnes toying with idea of Treaties w’out Russia. This

influences his attitude twds. this ques.

A.B. World support for internationalising flash points like Trieste or Tripoli.

H.D. Italy not doing too badly if they get Tripolitania.

Worried about anti-Yugosl. attitude twds. Trieste.

N.B. E.B. doesn’t exclude internationalisation of Trieste.

P.M. While we wd. endorse internat. port in Trieste, we don’t think it of

overwhelmg. importce. What we do think of vital importce is tht.

Peace Treaties shd. be considered by belligerent Powers.

Will communicate above concln to E.B.

Ruhr.

P.M. As in note. Enquiry into demilitarisation. Agreed.

E.Sh. Discn with U.S. Emb. re coal. They said were thinkg. of sending food

from U.S. Zone for Ruhr miners. But they want more coal for

export to European countries (other than France &amp; Belgium),

because of coal strike in U.S.A.

N.B. Plan for getting coal for Italy &amp; a little for France v. food for Ruhr

miners.

P.M. Let La Guardia look after Italy. No sympathy for Italy.

E.Sh. Wd. like to go &amp; look at Ruhr – after 3rd Rdg. of Bill. Agreed.

Palestine.

P.M. As in note of mtg. with E.B.

Egypt.

G.H. Also examn by Anglo-U.S. experts.

P.M. Will see B. members of Anglo-U.S. Cttee.

P.M. As in note.

U.S. Draft Treaty for Germany.

P.M. As in note. 188

A.B. Don’t want to be commd to keeping garrison in G. for 25 yrs.

U.S. Demand for Bases.

P.M. As in note.

M’while, leakage: &amp; I may be asked P.Q.

China.

P.M. As in note.

Reparations.

P.M. As in note.

2. Palestine (resumed).

Must keep things quiet pro tem.

G.H. Agreed certs. available for immigrn in Apl/May shd. be applied to

illegals at Spezia.

There were 300 odd left over. Agreed they cd. leave on

guarantee not to arrive Pal. before 15/5. Now hear another

party over 1.200 strong due in Pal. before the others – in

Smyrna fr. Constanzia. No certs. available for them. We

think preference shd. be given to Spezia party &amp; the others

detained on arrival, to await later quotas (June/July).

P.M. Cdn’t you anticipate the quota?

3. Sarawak.

G.H. Rpt. fr. M.P.’s.

Opinion locally a) preponderate: cession best for country

b) cession on principle

c) continuance of Brooke rule. Enough opinion in favour to warrant submn to Council Negri 15/6.

Propose confirm to Rajah tht. we will go ahead if Council confirm.

Must telegraph to-day.

Agreed.

4. India.

P.M. Break-down in negotiations. Mission will now, in a few days, put

out their proposals as their own. Re-described proposals for

189

benefit of E.W.

Seems tht. they got v. near to agreement. Might therefore accept it if

put out by us.

T.W. Desire of all sides to avoid publicn is favourable sign.

Will bring to Cab. on morning of announcement – 3 p.m. in London.

5. U.S. Loan.

H.D. Thro’ Senate. Has yet to go to H/Repres. Opinions differ wtr. harden

or not there.

But heartening to U.S. adminn. Final decn in 10 days or so.

6. S.W. Africa. History. Attitude of W.G. in 1919 favoured annexation.

A. Have had consultns with Smuts &amp; offls. They intend to put fully

documented case to U.N.O. But they want to get promises of

U.K. support – then other Doms.

Our support wd. help him v. Malan &amp; secessionists.

Geography. Is part of Union. Has bn. so administered.

Native Policy. S.A. Govt. have establd reservations – with native

councils in control – Rpts on this are favourable to Union

Govt.

Recent attempt to ascertain views of tribes. Some in favour: one

against.

Europ. popn. 2/3rds citizens of Union: 1/3rd Germans: some

still in internment.

Merits: overwhelmg. in favour of incorporating it. All young people

think of it now as already part of Union. To the n. is Bechuanaland: runs with the Rhodesias: averse to incorpn

Long time before that will die out. The Bechuana ???? chief

I recommend support be promised: and let Smuts discuss at P.M.M.

G.H. Strong argument against is the native policy of S. Africa.

in Union.

That was because B. in Rhodesias feared secession by S. Africa.

wants to come here &amp; say S.W. Africa shdn’t be incorporated

in Union.

The port in S.W. Africa belongs now to Union. Another reason for

incorpn.

D.O. v. anxious to support Smuts’ case.

We can’t sit on fence at U.N.O. Must make up our mind what we

shall say.

The feelings of Bechuanaland are echoed throughout Col. Empire.

Pravda is on to this – S. Afr. will be attacked when it comes to U.N.O.

And there must be 2/3rds majority there. N.Z. &amp; prs. Austr. will

be opposed.

190

P.M. They may have done well in S.W. Africa. But will be said, if you

incorporate, some native policy as in Union itself.

Diff. to oppose Smuts’ claim: but there will

G.H. Think we shd. have further discn with Smuts, either in Cab. or P.M.M. be diffies.

Don’t promise support. See how it goes in U.N.O.

N.B. Appreciate diffies of Smuts with his secessionists.

Relevant tht. Heraros (?) are opposing incorpn – a cause celebre

at Geneva.

E.B.’s view: C.O. case made at Cab. on 24/4 is v. strong.

Trusteeship = supervision.

Anyone ruling natives ought to be willing to accept supervision.

A.B. Last sentence before concln (2) of C.M.37(46) 3 is limit to wh. we shd.

go.

A. Smuts’ case is tht. he has done this: satisfy. himself a majority of

white &amp; black are in favour. Not clear wtr. “by methods

acceptable to U.N.O.”

Wd. like Smuts’ views to be given at first hand.

E.Sh. At P.M.M. first – exchange of views – then we can decide.

Goes beyond treatment of natives. Canada mght. ask re N’foundland. Austr. &amp; N.Z. may have their eye on other

territories.

P.M. Discuss at P.M.M. And put as our view the concln of C.M. 37(46) 3.

A. Smuts wd. like to know Cab. views before discussed at P.M.M.

P.M. Then tell him C.M. 37(46) 3 is our attitude: and see what he says then.

[Exit Noel Baker.

7. Divorce.

J. 3 schemes.

a) President’s scheme. I wd. like to modify (i). Shd. be Co. Court

Judge. (ii) parties shd. be compelled to attend &amp; answer

c) Haldane Society.

ques. in undefended cases.

b) Labour Party.

They differ fundamentally. Desirable: to have Cttee to consider them.

It shd. be narrow enquiry but wd. have to include ques. of

reconciliation.

If we had gone on to consider merits, we shd. have disagreed.

But we all agree to pass the buck to another Cttee.

H.O. suggest addn of words to t. of r. to make it clear tht. Cttee shd.

have power to consider Forum – High Court or Co. Court. 191

P.M. Public enquiry, hearing evce, wd take a long time. to wh. entitled under existg. law.

A.B. Give impn of enquiry into machinery for giving quicker the divorces

H.D. No need to sit in public. Agreed.

P.M. Need reconciliation be included? Won’t this delay it.

J. Essential. Churches favour it. SK. Lodge spoke in favour of it.

Agree Haldane Socy. are against it.

P.M. Seen it working v. well in Russia.

E.W. Keep in reconciln because of the children.

G.A.I. Shd. include a solr. or two – not all barristers.

J. Cttee of 8 or 9, with 3 or 4 women.

P.M. Tone down reconciln in t. of r. so as to enable you to maintain tht.

this Cttee is concerned only with machinery.

Memo. approved.
