C.M. 23(46). 11th March, 1946.

1. Germany.

E.B. Diffy. over G. level of industry. Rpt. (to be circd) looks more

promising.

Told V. we wdn’t agree to level involvg. payment by us: &amp; wdn’t

accept repns agreemt. to contrary effect. Signs of change in

R. attitude. Diffce only on prodn of electr. industry.

Pp. on Ruhr &amp; Saar now ready for considn. Confined myself to

industrial side of this problem. Fr. however concerned re

political side too: &amp; Fr. Comm. now asking for united

Germany. (on instns of Russia?).

H.D. Need for better stats. fr. Germany.

H.M. Will it cover duration – peace terms?

2. Greece.

E.B. Have stood firm on elections being held – can’t help it if EAM

boycotts them. W’out elections we shd. drift into v. unsatisf.

posn.

Sophoulis will stand firm, whoever leaves him.

Must get B. troops out - £34 m. p.a..

It was their date &amp; part of our econ. reconstn bargain.

General agreement of whole Cabinet with

this view.

E.B. Tipped Thurs. tht. R. wd. turn on heat again thro’ Union/Demcr.

Control.

It has come this a.m. – signed too by 70 Labour M.P.’s. Urge for

postponement of Gk. elections.

Must stand firm, even against this sort of pressure.

A.B. On F. Af. Cttee – There is another group trying to start up in opposn.

H.M. We cd. raise this on Liaison Cttee (?)

We shall have to face this issue sooner or later in Party mtg.

3. Manchuria.

E.B. Complt. tht. R stripping equipmt. wh. under agreemt. = repves stuff.

They have bn. delaying take-over by Chinese, also in contravn of

agreemt.

W. Koo asked me if this was authd at Moscow – I said no.

In Germany – they stripped the east &amp; then demanded share of

70

remaining total. May try same again: i.e. strip Manchuria &amp; then

seek share in equipmt. in Japan.

Cab. agreed Fri. to shares of Jap. Repves. To preserve our posn I sent

note to R. suggestg. it be left in charge of custodian – tho’

hasn’t bn. so left it preserves the principle tht. what was in

Manchuria is w’in total to be divided. Agreed.

4. Persia.

E.B. a) Enlarged Az. on Caspian. ? R. have.

Second U.S. note – re movemt. of troops s. towards Tehran.

Asked me to support. Wasn’t sure of facts (wh. came thro’

U.S. Consul at Tabriz). So contented myself with askg. for

reply to my first note.

b) Have agreed to support U.S. in askg. tht. it be brght. again to

Sec-Council.

5. Mr. Churchill’s Speech in U.S.A.

E.B. Suggd in U.S. Press tht. we were consulted in advance. Hope all will

make it clear that we didn’t see it in advance. V. embarrassing

tht. it was circulated here by M of I. some hours before speech

was made.

P.M. The U.S. asked for M of I. to handle it.

But if Truman spoke in U.S., M of I. wd. normally handle it?

E.B. Think not. Reverse: speech made here is circulated thro’ B.I.S. in

U.S.A. Now if Tr. spoke U.S. agencies here wd. handle it.

Anyhow, it’s v. embarrassing to me. And policy on this for the future

shd. be made clear.

J.J.L. In H/C. AE. sincerely denied tht. WSC. was going to spk. as

McGovern said he wd.

P.M. B. Embassy attd a man to W.S.C.

R.S.C. And M of I. handles any important speech made abroad.

H.M. B.I.S. was handling this in U.S.: M of I. had it, &amp; all newspp. wanted

it. As a pure matter of mechanics M of I. helped them.

You can’t ignore the offl. posn of Leader of Opposition.

And cd. you discriminate acc. to nature of the speech.

Can we deny to Leader/Opposn the mechanical resources of M of I.

Let us consider future policy by all means: but all arguments aren’t

on one side.

P.M. Don’t believe M of I. cd. have refused when they had the copy. They

71

were commd by action taken in U.S. And I believe B. Embassy

started it, by agreeing to attack press offr. to W.S.C.

It was news &amp; M of I. handled it as such.

R.S.C. Thought our policy was that M of I. was news service not Govt. organ.

If so, it must handle all speeches which are news. This surely was.

E.Sh. Why wasn’t it shown to Ministers before to Press?

P.M. It is a service to Press.

E.B. I will enquire into B. Emb. part in this.

On the merits, I have decided not to offer any comment on this speech.

A.B. I hope E.B. won’t follow this line. We shd. have a view on this. And

if we are assocd with it in world opinion, we shd. say when we

disagree. We’ll be pressed in H/C. to say so.

P.M. We can say – our posn has bn. made plain in Debate. And will be

again.

R.S.C. Cd. you add to reply to P.Q. tht. there was no consultn with H.M.G. It

has bn. specifically alleged in U.S. Press.

P.M. “HMG. had no knowledge of contents before delivered” I will add

that. That will cover Driberg’s P.Q. to P.M.G. Tuesd.

E.B. I want Party to stand on my last speech. That is our policy.

6. Egypt.

E.B. Some elements began to play with fire - &amp; its now beyond their control.

Told on Sat. signs of great upheaval to-day. And tht. Sidky wdn’t be

able to control. Have therefore told mil. (after consultg. P.M.)

they must intervene to prevent its getting right out of hand: tho’

to w’draw as soon as they can.

King is now alarmed. No news yet: may pass off.

[Enter W.W.

7. Parliamentary Procedure.

H.M. Campion has natural bias in favour of H/C. We are more concerned

with Govt.

a) Summd proposals. G.G. recommns re supply based on assumptn

tht. H/C. has abandoned use of Supply to control finance &amp; using it to watch adminn.

Points out tht. H/C. is hampered by rule against disc. future

legn in Supply.

We propose reducg. 28 to 26 – elastic, not spread thro’ year.

72

Cd. take the risk up to 4 days – and it wd. be a concession. Some

gamble in it fr. Govt. pt/view. Sessional S.O. &amp; cd. be

reviewed.

b) Budget. We agree procedure is too long-drawn out.

Propose Rpt-stage be dropped. Or para. c. Rpt. Stage on all

Bills other than Finance Bill – debate &amp; amendmt. be

restricted as proposed.

c) Restns on motions for re-committal.

d) Dy Spkr. to be empowered to accept Closure Motion.

e) Business Cttee.

f) Debate on “Clause stand part.”

g) Financial Resolutions.

Who shd. give evidence? P.M. H.M. H.M. with help of Fin. Secy.

Recommns considered seriatim.

Paras. a) and b) agreed.

.. c). A.B. Right of Spkr. to select wd. depend on

Minister’s statement.

x/ Need for formula wh. Minister must use.

A.V.A V. severe restn on rights of Opposition.

A.B. And if Minister doesn’t use formula as at x/

Opposn wd. press in Cttee.

d) – e) agreed.

g) – h) ..

P.M. Any support for Campion’s suppressed proposals?

E.W. Time limit for speeches. - No support.

A.G. Aff. Resoln procedure. Hope H.M.’s proposal will be adopted.

Agreed. [Exit W.W.

Enter C.J.

8. North Borneo.

H.D. I offered £2.1 m. – quite enough. Really too much. Wd. enable them

to pay 13/=. They were 10/2 on average over 16 years.

Want it agreed we shd. not offer more than £2.1 m.

I suggd arbitration – net maintainable revenue. They know that no

arbitrator on that formula wd. give as much as £2.1 m. They

Agreed want t. of r. at large – so tht. they can bring up argument

x/ re HMG – failure to keep the war away from Borneo.

On second point I wd. prefer to asked mil. govt. to continue

to ask C.O. to put in caretaker adminn.

Opposed to allowing Co. to go back at all.

J.J.L. It is C. Aff. 50% Australians. And planned for them to w’draw.

H.D. Why not ask Austr. to let them stay.

73

R.S.C. Don’t let Co. go back.

C.J. Must be either Co. or mil. We have no sovereign rights to administer

civilly.

Cd. hardly legislate before ¼.

H.D. y/ Accept principle tht. mil. adminn shd. continue. And let C.O., D.O. &amp;

W.O. consider how. We haven’t asked Australia.

Agreed x/ and y/.

[Exit C.J.

9. Transfer of Ships to French Navy.

A.V.A. As in memo. Paragraph 11. (b) helps us to sell F.A.A. aircraft.

Our policy = help Fr. to rebuild their defence forces.

H.D. Agree. Review 11(b) at end/2 years.

Must get a figure for Colossus if we sell. Worth at least £1 m.

E.B. Agree.

E.W. Cd. Fr. public be told tht. we are doing something to help? Memories

of Oran.

A.V.A. They don’t read their own Press. We’ve helped with German ships

too. Tillon has made a most gracious speech in welcomg. our

gift of G. ships.

P.Q. in H/C. on this new deal.

[Enter J.W.

10. Bulk Purchase of Cotton.

H.M. As in memo.

R.S.C. Cttees &amp; Control are convinced tht. Control can handle it.

A.G. Powers?

R.S.C. When M/Supply powers are transferred to me.

J.W. Para. 5 of memo. Stress this.

H.D. Timing. E.B. &amp; I might inform Halifax – saying it’s decided but

askg. for views on relation of announcemt. to Loan: i.e. date

&amp; manner.

R.S.C. Wd. like to announce before I leave. [Exit J.W.

74

11. Admission of Women to Foreign Service.

E.B. “Insalubrious spots” – is protectn to prevent all women being sent to

those spots.

E.W. No need for anxiety. Even re Ambassadresses husbands.

H.D. Collect publicity for this too.

12. Accommodation of Students &amp; Tourists in 1926.

E.B. Tho’ schools etc. not available I’m worried about failure to provide

for students. Want Cttee to look for other possibilities. Mustn’t

miss the opportunities arising to bring such people over.

Cd. Cttee be given wider t. of r.

H.D. In war visited RAF. stations. Many no longer used.

S. We wd. consider that – thro’ Airfields Cttee.

R.S.C. V. isolated: accommn must be used to house those concerned with

stores etc.

E.W. Wrong approach – fr. accommn end. My offls. cd. get some good

schools e.g. Stowe if linen, rockery &amp; staff made available.

M/S. have the materials. Ques. of staff. Cd. WAAF. or ATS. or

WRNS. be seconded?

R.S.C. We cdn’t release linen. Bn. trying to do somethg. for hotels. Can’t do

more than 30.000 beds – even that will w’draw sheets from

public.

P.M. V. unpopular to give to tourists what housewives require so keenly.

H.M. Better wait until we can provide somethg. up to N. Am. standards.

Do it imaginatively &amp; well. [Enter Marquand.

M. We have explored these possibilities – incldg. approaches to

Universities &amp; Schools.

Concln – not good enough to try this year. If we wait until ‘47

we shd. make a better go of it.

This doesn’t mean no tourists in ’46. See second para. of annex.

Scheme for Swedes – moored in the river eating own food!

E.B. Ask that we shd. have Cttee retained &amp; enlarged for 1947. Bring in

Limits on what we can do in ’46.

Service Dpts. Use of troopships.

J.J.L. We can release hotels before ’47! As demobiln continues. 75

A.B. Want Cttee to consider also accommn for medical education.

While Berlin etc., is out.

Post-graduate – which wd. attract students from overseas.

A. M/L. hostels.

E.B. Use 3 organisations – W.T.A., Hol. Fellowships, Nat. Hostels Assocn

taking it on contract.

T.W. Competing claim – accomm. German p.o.w.
