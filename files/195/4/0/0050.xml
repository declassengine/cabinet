A. Coal Bill in H/L. Diffies: selection of members of consumers’ council can be next.

Accounts – might be met. If these two are met, Oppn won’t press diff. ques. of compensn.

H.D. Beware of precedent – can’t have detailed scrutiny of accounts, for sake of other schemes.

A.V.A. Don’t resist what we have demanded for private cos.

H.M. Shd. be a policy. Have Ty. got one?

Debates before Recess.

Agreed.

H.M. What of India &amp; Palestine?

India: W.S.C. wanted 2 days: trying for one.

A.V.A. Wd. be better for atmosphere in India (elections to consitit. assembly over by 27 July) to p’pone debate as far as poss.

H.M. Try for Autumn: if not, as late as poss. before Recess.

A. H/Lds. want debate on 15/7.

H.M. Try to get it later.

P.M. Palestine. Pressing Truman to send his team: now names 15/7. Must have debate before recess: &amp; must have some decisions. May have to say we’ll do so: so if U.S. will come in.

268

Also pressure from U.S.

[Enter Listowel

3. Political Broadcasting b) my b’cast wasn’t controversial. } my memoranda.

[Enter Barnes &amp; G.T.

4. Nationalisation of Transport

P.M. Some prelimy discns with some colleagues. Handed round drafts of letters to W.S.C. &amp; B.B.C.

H.M. This shd. settle it.

a) willing to resume pol. b’casting. } These cover both

In 3rd para. of ls. to B.B.C., shdn’t “might” be “would”?

P.M. I wd. rather not claim an automatic right. “Might will” – Agreed.

L. Agreed.

Agreed: both letters to be despatched.

[Exit L.

a ) General case for limit of 40 miles.

H.M. Statistics show this is biggest single factor in road haulage. If this were given away, rest wd. be prejudiced – (i) loss of revenue (ii) repercussions on rlwys.

Cttee decided this was right. Small men will be all right: fair considn fr. tribunals.

Politically, will be some trouble – tho’ many will accept what we propose. And T.U.’s will fear even this goes too far.

269

H.D. I was reluctant (politically): but am now ready to accept, subject to special

arrangemts. for devel. areas.

(b) Development Areas

H.M. Sympathy with M/T. App. But B/T are in real diffy. They say determining

factor in getting firms to go to develop. area is whr. a firm can run own

transport. Won’t be satisfy. to leave it to Tribunal – won’t know where

he is. Therefore I’ve suggd this power of direction be given to the

Minister. Don’t object if Minister’s direction is given thro’ licensing

authy. B/T. not satisfy. with provn tht. l. authy. shall “take account” of

this consideration.

A.B. Will this concession apply also to firms who have already establd branches

in devel. areas.

H.D. It should. Short-term problem. Support H.M.’s proposal.

B. Principle. Can’t escape this problem &amp; can’t get agreement. As you placate

pol. opposn you will undermine co-ordination &amp; build up opposn fr. those

who favour natn.

Develop. area. Practical way of solving it is to settle principles on wh. l.

authies will handle it. I’ve accepted Cab. view they shall have their

licence if they are genuinely handling their own business only.

Directions to Reg. authy. shd. be such as to assure that. If so, develop.

areas firm is met. But to save further delay, I am ready to bow to

B/Trade &amp; Ty. even tho’ I believe its wrong.

A.V.A. What about between loads &amp; avoidance of empty journeys?

P.M. The stronger you put the argument for devel. areas, the more you

demonstrate that the concession shd. apply in other areas.

G.T. May this not restrict discretion of l. authy. By makg. exclusive the

privileges of devel. areas.

But to avoid delay. I will bow to this: tho’ I believe dev. area case will get

thro’ under para. 3 (i) and (ii).

Freeing carriage under 40 miles meets more of the cases. If you go beyond you undermine the road haulage system &amp; railways.

Bricks &amp; cement. 40-miles limit won’t apply. As before, there wd. be no diffy. Rather than limit to devel. area, I wd. prefer to have a direction to l. authy. to see that servicing of a factory must be ensured.

H.M. We have a devel. area policy: &amp; are doing all sorts of special things for it.

A.V.A. And you give a 1st class argument to Parlt. that private enterprise can provide these transport services more cheaply than a nationalised system.

B. That’s why I wd. prefer to rely on the directions wh. I give to l. authy.

270

A. Don’t see how you can stop at dirn in resp. of develop. areas.

J. Discriminate in favour of devel. areas but not on face of the Bill. Why not

give Ministers a power to give a specific direction (not in terms related

to devel. areas) but let Cab. agree that this shall be done in devel. area

cases.

H.M. A general power wd. be criticised – improper pressure on Minister etc.

[Exit Barnes &amp; G.T.

P.M. A compct. Opposn wd. knock hell out of this.

A.V.A. Yes, they would.

H.M. I cd. defend it: on basis tht. preference for Devel. Areas is positive Govt. policy.

Agreed: accept H.M.’s solution.

c) Farmers

Agreed.

[Enter J.S., N.B.

5. Canadian Wheat Contract

J.S. Remember this arose fr. strong pressure on us from Canada. D.O. pressed me to get on with it. When I got there, I found tht. Gardiner was pressing for it; but appeared rest of Govt. split &amp; they don’t know whr. they want it or not.

Then learned that it wd. prejudice the Loan. Informed Cab. As a result, its held up: &amp; opponents in Canada have this opportunity to press their case.

I propose: don’t discuss until Loan cleared &amp; we know what Can Govt.

x/ propose. But they mustn’t be allowed to use this pause to re-open terms of contract on existing lines. But latest development – Wash’ton Tel. 4296 – all these long-term contracts

are contrary to I.T.O. ideas. We have 4 or 5 running now with S.

Doms. &amp; seeking another with Denmark.

U.S. have a bad case on this. cf. 10 year agreemt. betwn. U.S. &amp; Canada on

news. pulp.

H.D. Sorry this contract wasn’t clinched. Agree to x/ re Canada.

W’ton Telegram is monstrous. U.S. have always admittd tht. long-term contracts with long-term regular suppliers don’t affect I.T.O. This must be traversed. Am disposed to wait until after Loan is thro’. But must consider with Ty., B/T.

H.M. Discussed at large what we shd. do about it all, some time.

271

This contract I wd. justify as special measure for transition: not as settled part of permanent Govt. policy. Avoid head-on collision on ques. of principle.

Disposed to reply thus before Loan debate.

N.B. Don’t tie our hands: over long-term contracts.

Agreed: { a) verbal commn thro’ Makins to cover y/.

ques. of princ.

A. Care over a. not to compromise our general position.

Agreed.

[Enter J.B.H.

6 . Gift Food Parcels for Overseas.

A.B. Why not recall that this was designed to increase wheat prodn – by giving confidence to primary producers.

H.D. Agree. Helpful suggns for reply – but don’t want to reply now.

H.M. y/ I want Clayton to have a line of Defence which we cd. use if others raise this in Loan debate.

{ b) inter-dept. unhurried consultn to bring up draft on

J.S. May I send personal tel. to Gardiner askg. him to keep us infd

Best s’guard = limit it to rationed foods.

Germany: no quad. agreemt. &amp; no p. post. But U.S. are starting such a

service: to U.S. and B. Zones. Robertson inclined to favour same

security risk as for A.

J.S. Diff. to refuse facilities for relatives &amp; close friends. Problem = avoid abuse.

J.B.H. Favour in principle: small nos. &amp; concern since postal contact resumed.

Austria: quad. agreemt. on p. post service wh. enables food parcel to go so long as not sent by individual (shop instead). Cd. pos. be amended to fit in with M/F scheme.

H.M. Favour it in principle. Worried re politics: bad temper over rationing: feeling re Germany fluctuates. Believe this is wrong moment to do it. P’pone 3 months.

P.M. Favoured delay.

J.J.L. There wd. be claim for some facilities for relations to send parcels to B. soldiers in G. &amp; Austria.

Rationing may be awkward: let it settle down for a while.

272

How cd. you prevent people pressing unduly weaker brethren to send their

food.

A. Counselled delay. More will oppose than will welcome.

J.S. Obvious there cdn’t be a worse moment for U.K.

But it is these next 2 mos. which are the most critical for relatives etc. in G. &amp; A. betwn. now &amp; the European harvest.

J. Controversy over this has died down. Leave it alone.

Agreed: Postpone for a time. 273
