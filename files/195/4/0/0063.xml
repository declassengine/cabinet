1. Parliament. [Enter. W.W.

H.M. Tues:

Frid: Roosevelt Memorial. P.M. to move. W.S.C. to follow.

R.S.C. India?

A. Shall complete business in month.

P.M. Welcomed J.L., A. and G.A.I.

J. Pendg. case to Privy Council on ques. wtr. Canada can abolish appeal

put it on Canada to suggest what shd. be done.

A. Attitude of Canadians.

to Privy Council. Likely to be decided tht. they can. Then we

A. Fr. Canada will want to keep it.

3. Enquiry into Press. write to order, even falsifying facts. b) growth of groups subject

Intrusion of views into news (part of (a)).

Problem: functioning of Press in free democr. society. As strong a

of independce.

H.M. N.U.J. originated demand &amp; feel strongly a) reporters expected to

to control of one man.

Labour M.P.’s have tabled Motion – strongly supported.

case for enquiry into that as into B.B.C., which we have

conceded.

R. Commn might recommend legn. Recognise diffy. of that. But we

cd. consider when Rpt. received.

Judge – or ex-Judge or Sc. Judge – wd. be helpful: give appearance

P.Q. to P.M. for Tuesday (Marples).

334

P.M. Feel gt. diffy. The more R.C. brght. out evils, greater pressure for

action.

Govt. to act. And how cd. we curb, esp. chains groups etc.

What help to expose evils, if result is demand for impossible

R.S.C. Dangerous to embark on enquiry w’out policy of own. Launch this

enquiry &amp; don’t know how you can deal with results.

Better have Cttee of Cab. to consider what policy we cd. adopt if

these facts were disclosed.

A.B. Even so, favour enquiry. Resultg. agitn wd. inspire solution.

Evil situation already exists – morale being weakened by daily diet of

lies &amp; half truths. Inducing atmosphere of pessimism &amp; daily

denigration.

Vast area of corruption – salaries of columnists &amp; expenses.

Newspaper spends only 12½ % of expendre on editorial staff.

Proprietors aren’t newspaper men.

D. Mail: compensn paid on change of executives – mainly out of

E.P.T.

During Squatting – Ev. Standard story re export of prefabs.

Must find out who owns newspp. – who the nominees represent etc.

R.S.C. All this depends on wtr. we have any remedy to apply.

T.W. a) Wd. enquiry draw out the disgraceful points mentioned by A.B.?

Doubt it.

J. I doubt that. May get a whitewash. We shall then look foolish.

Short of hostile xmn, doubt if facts will come out. Witnesses will

be squared.

G.A.I. If we drop this now, and N.U.J. carry their resoln at T.U.C., what then?

Surely Govt. can’t admit they have no remedy.

Northcliffe was the first to draw attentn to danger of monopoly in

Press. Get hold of his pamphlet.

Strong demand in U.S. for more informn re U.K.

P.M. But what remedy?

Can you have Freedom of Press w’out Freedom to Lie?

A.B. Right to lie is democratic right: but public have right to ascertain

wtr. speaker is a liar.

E.Sh. Only way to counter a lie is to emphasise truth.

Why are N.U.J. so keen? Because they fear monopolies, as threat to

emplt. Their right course is direct action. If they are too weak

to do so, R. Commn won’t help them.

Right line is to see tht. pp. which do support us get help &amp; informn:

and to see we are in posn to counter lies in newspp. Our Party

propaganda isn’t good enough: &amp; doubt if Govt. prop. is either.

335

P.M. How do you prevent a group getting power – or a paper distorting

the news.

A. a) Doubt if we cd. get the facts.

Reluctant to start this w’out knowing what we cd. do.

putting our

b) Don’t see how you cd. prevent a man from lying.

Wd. prefer to approach this fr. angle of improving machinery for case.

P.M. Suppose we find K. group controls 100 newspp. How cd. you

Problem = check multiple ownership.

check that?

A.B. Ascending scale of taxation on advertising revenue.

P.M. That wd. hit independent equally with chain newspp.

A.B. Increased newsprint has gone into advertising vice news.

P.M. Only new factor is increase in control by one man. Tell me how we

cd. deal with that.

answer &amp; have a policy.

Reform newspp. or debunk them. Let public know the truth.

But consequences worry me.

by a Press Lord?

P.M. Risk of being driven into Govt. control.

E.Sh. Any other form of enquiry better. Select Cttee?

H.M. Too political.

R.S.C. Powers to get evce on oath. Only by T. of E. (Evce) Act.

J. Nominee shareholders – you cd. deal with generally.

R.S.C. That is covered by Cohen Report.

H.M. The nub of the whole case of N.U.J. – reporters can’t tell the truth.

New idea tht. you mustn’t appoint a R. Commn unless you know the

P.E.P. have made a report on this.

Strong feeling in Party &amp; movement.

P.M. May have to hold enquiry now you’ve gone so far.

“Daily pessimism.” Alternative – directions what they are to say?

A.B. D. Mirror circulation 3½ m. Maintd its independence because shares

widely held.

Result: managed by newspaper men. What if this was collared

336

A.B. Believe a R. Commn can take evce on oath. This shd. be looked into.

P.M. T. of r. How to secure freedom (i.e. fr. control of interests as well as

A.B. Cd. J., R.S.C. &amp; H.M. consider t. of r. &amp; make recommns.

L.C.J. hopes you won’t

Govt.)

J. I will, if asked, try to get a Judge. I have, however, ascertained tht. ask for a Judge. Must be kept free fr. any

J. Cd. we reserve final decision until we see t. of r. and names and

again.

McNeil.

suspicion of bias. Hope I won’t be asked to press a Judge to help

in something so near the political.

Wd. prefer Sir H. Hetherington. General support for that.

H.M. Names shd. be scrutinised by Cab. – or at least P.M.

powers.

Agreed: H.M. to consult with J. &amp; R.S.C. and bring up

[Exit W.W.

[Enter J.S. Barnes

4. Indian Food Requirements. P.M. Is this continuing need? If we gave now, wd. we have to give again

But wd. this cure trouble. Wd. still have 233.000 t. deficiency. Shd.

made U.S. believe U.K. had more than enough.

Fear help fr. us will increase reluctance of India to practice

R.S.C. Case for loan, to meet gap due to specific cause, to tide over to 1947.

J.S. No prospects of repayment.

How can I go on pressing Canada for the extra 40 m. bushels if I

J.S. Gave U.K. stock position and U.S. shipping prospects.

next year.

R.S.C. Understood this was tempy failure in allotted supplies because of

shipping strike.

H.M. If so, it shd. be on loan.

we therefore start diverting. Early experience was tht. diversions

Stressed M/F. argument v. maintaing. bread rationing here because

shortage abroad.

self-help.

Pol. position in India is now v. favourable. Dangerous to damage that.

We haven’t got anything fr. any source but Canada.

Diversion for B. territory in S.E.A. (87.000 t) must have priority over

this.

show I can spare this for India.

337

R.S.C. State in India shd. make it clear tht. isn’t a case of our being able to do

w’out it.

J.S. Stocks now } 729 wheat + 248 flour at present.

in U.K. } 737 .. + 300 .. at 1/11.

Loss now of 100.000 t. might well mean that we shdn’t get our stocks

above danger level all thro’ winter.

J.S. Canadian p’mme is lagging now – 113.000 t. down in Sept.

There are chances of swops – e.g. Can. barley via U.S. ports – against

has bn. 12., only now coming down.

J.S. We have done much to help India: cd. do more with detailed swops:

B. Yes. Priority to Indian loadings can be given.

J.S. If S.E.A. is to have priority: I will try swops on barley &amp; maize: but

Swops on barley &amp; maize.

[Exit J.S. Enter Edwards.

G.A.I. More seaman’s strike to come in Canada.

R.S.C. Yet we added 100.000 t. in Sept.

J.S. But this is the stock bldg. season – before St. Lawrence closes in

mid-Nov.

This time in 1945 stocks were 50% higher.

B. P’mme is lagging because congestion in St. Lawrence.

E.Sh. Cd. the diversion be a loan v. expectn from Argentine.

J.S. Fear that Argentine wd. then cancel export licences: either India’s

or ours.

later deliveries wh. wd. otherwise go to India. Wd. Cab. wish me

to explore.

G.H. S.E.A. territories worse than India: no stocks at all: living hand-to-

mouth on v. low ration indeed. No wheat for them fr. Australia (regular source of supply) until Dec. Ration 6½ or 7: and India

but S.E.A. needs must come first.

P.M. 100.000 t. diversion can’t be authd.

P.L. Can we then get ships to lift the maize fr. the Argentine.

don’t want to divert any more wheat.

A. Open diversion wd. have bad effect in Canada.

Agreed: Priority for S.E.A.

Quick lift fr. Argentine

338

5. Japanese Merchant Ship-Building. of reductn wd. be …

Increased competition in textiles.

B. trade.

P.M. Summarised history. Issue narrowed down to size of ship.

H.McN. E.B. has re-considered &amp; remains of same opinion. Consequences

This wd. mean deficit area.

Political animosity in Japan.

R.S.C. This is an attempt to give B. shipping preferential posn over all

Thought we were cutting down only qua security. Can’t take into

account effect on B. shipping unless we consider other trades too.

Security is a strong ground: once we have it we are in a bog.

H.M. Ty. not disturbed at latest proposal. They want to improve J. balance

Cd. Japs run chartered ships vice

of payments: but don’t put that v. strategic argument of Admy. bldg. them.

Edw. Admy case: if we allow the larger type of vessel, they can transfer to

warship-bldg. If limited to 2.000 they can’t turn over even to

ships.

b) Told tht. w’in 2 yrs. there will be a slump in B-ship building. The less

R.S.C. That (b) is my real ground of objection.

B. I support this primarily on security grounds. Our own experience

guarantee for an island.

Agree our argument must rest on security grounds.

destroyers.

P.M. Either you control or not. If you do, you can prevent switch to war

If you don’t, you can’t prevent their going above the 2.000 limit.

E.Sh. a) Depends what you mean by “warship”.

You can construct a merchant ship wh. can be used as a warship.

competition fr. Japan the better. Why not restrict them to coastal.

shows tht. ship-bldg. capacity is most important security

Rapid conversion to warship-bldg.

On b) there will be a serious contraction of B. bldg. If J. competition

then comes in, posn will be serious. T.W. How long can we hold down J. to these levels – on security or

A. Doms. have bn. consulted. Austr. &amp; N.Z. favour 2.000 on security

grounds.

S. Africa not keen, tho’ favour some limitn for a period.

commercial grds.

339

H.M. This is Allied policy – not B. alone.

As the case can rest purely on security &amp; Doms. favour it, we shd.

support the memo.

R.S.C. Remember this will damage our other industries.

by ruining our enemies. Support R.S.C. Only cure is to ensure

can’t then be made. Anyhow next war is always waged with

A.B. Surely Germany has taught us tht. we can’t establish our prosperity

prosperity of J. not it’s impoverishment.

Security: proper method is inspectn at “finishing” end. Weapons

new weapons.

P.M. Prime need is to decide what we are going to do with Japan.

This is particular example of policy of destroying war potential. Can’t destroy it all.

P.L. Agreed with P.M. &amp; A.B.

A.B. Period of years – this is the time when they are no danger.

E.Sh. Why not let J. begin with coastal trade.

P.M. Because she is an island: needs more than coastal.

T.W. }

Agreed: balance of opinion v. Admy. &amp; M/T.

J. as an island can’t live w’out merchant navy.

U.S. support this – they are threatened more than we.

J. Support memo. if limited to term of years. Then we are with Doms.

G.H. Agreed.

J.J.L. Attempt to suppress J. will drive them to work thro’ China.

J.W. } Supported P.M.

G.A.I. }

[Exit Barnes &amp; Edwards. J.J.L.

6. International Employment Policy.

H.M. Only issue for Cabinet is in para. 2 of covering memo.

Read telegram from P.J. Dangerous views. Won’t pursue that now

because C/E. made the appointment and isn’t here.

Only ques. is wtr. internatl institns like the Bank shd. play their part.

P.M. Need for small group of Ministers to watch this while Conference is

on.

E.B. Want our people to play down national action: stress international.

340

R.S.C. Must deal with both. Internatl ideas must be translated into national

policies.

And U.S. won’t be represented.

G.A.I. I.L.O. is considering this ques. They shd. be brought in: they may

be useful. 341
