P.M. thght. diff. to do it until M/Food back.

P.M. B.S. now leaving 20/3. But can’t be back for certain. Better

3. Persia. E.B. U.S. proposed to put on Agenda for Sec. Council if Persians didn’t

Thought better tht. U.S. shd. make the challenge esp. as we were

4. Egypt.

because believed Sov. were pressing P. not to bring it up.

parties to Treaty &amp; had w’drawn our troops. Also Anglo-Persian.

U.S. publish their notes too soon. But they’ve done it.

Heard this a.m. tht. Persia are persistg. despite pressure in bringing it

fwd.

Satisfd tht. R. objective is oil – not territory or warm water. Believe

U.S. operators in S. Af. cd. draw off the oil fr. Baker fields – will

M/F &amp; P. verify this. Wd. make boundary issue more acute.

Campbell on his way. 12 apptd to negotiate: not our affair to ques.

assurance tht. they are repve &amp; it will be ratified.

E.B. Seen our repve ( ? ) Some prospects of reasonable Treaty.

Trouble a) WafD b) Russian activities: 80 persons in their Legation.

these because Wafd not included. But can &amp; will ask for

Campbell will take prelim. talks. Then a team of experts, mil. &amp;

other. Finally, I think I wd. go there vice bringing them here.

A.V.A. Shall we hold it afterwds. if WafD not included.

E.B. But if I decline to negotiate, I’m interfering with domestic concerns

of another country. And might come to Sec. Council – where I wd. be repd as willing to negotiate only if I cd. choose whom

I negotiated with.

82

A.V.A. Wafd have gt. resentment v. G.B.

E.B. .. boycotted last Eg. election: I can’t tell E. Govt. they

aren’t

5. Levant States.

repve. E.B. Out of Syria by 30/4. Reducg. in Lebanon. Diffies with Fr. Leb.

this. We cd. get out by June ’46. Reasonable date for all wd.

I propose we

proposg. to put it back to S. Council. I can’t be tied to Fr. on

be Aug. Believe Fr. exaggerate the physical diffies of w’drawal. come out by June. Agreed.

6. Denmark.

E.B. Want all B. troops out of Denmark. Planned to come out.

of Danes being able to say we are going out.

7. Greece.

Result = rept. tht. R. are w’drawg. fr. Bornholm. This is result

V. great gain. Clears Baltic.

A.B. Statemt. by Gk. P.M. tht. he can’t guarantee elections in free condns.

have taken to protect free elections.

E.B. V. well: will do that. At right opportunity.

H.M. Can E.B. cover the point tht. there will

If we adhere to our policy. I suggest early statement on ships we

be free elections w’out

Don’t know how far B. troops cd. be used or Gk. police

T.W. See tht. B.B.C. give full publicity to the statement when made.

8. Dejazmach Gugsa.

force &amp; violence.

relied upon.

S. What did he do in our war?

P.M. Lived on Ty.

the Cabinet.

R.S.C. How far are we commd by authd statement of behalf of B. Govt.

tht. we wd. not hand him over. M/State was then a member of

83

H.M. And subsequently confirmed by War Cab. anyhow.

That legalistically meets RSC. point.

P.M. Hand him over &amp; say he shd. be tried.

R.S.C. Para 4 of memo. – in support of my point.

said to G. And if original statement was as stated in para. 1,

I’m ready to consult A.E.

H.D. “Posn will be reviewed” means in my view re-opening whole matter.

J. What matters is, now W. Cab. decn (wh. is domestic), but what was

our hands are free.

R.S.C. Make a statemt. indicatg. we aren’t going back on undertaking.

P.M. Need we say anything?

R.S.C. Don’t want right of asylum whittled away. Consult O.L. ? (Not

favoured.)

E.B. In an aside – I will see the Ch. Pol. Officer.

Proposal appd in principle.

9. Brabazon I Aircraft. [Enter Wilmot, Barnes &amp;

I. Thomas.

P.M. Two points – as in memo.

A. M/C.A. not v. keen on project: other Dpts are, however.

If so, other proposals (for runway) follow. Must be ready for next

View of Cttee was tht. project shd. proceed.

year, when machine finished, &amp; work must therefore start this

year. Minister has power to take the land for runway alone:

otherwise hybrid Bill, which wd. be too late.

P.M. Anyone against continuing scheme?

H.D. I was in favour before: but disturbed re para. 9. View is now

balanced.

model, they are interested in model with jet engines. Ministry

I.T. Mustn’t overstate views of operators. Tho’ not interested in earlier

do favour project.

This won’t be in service until 1950. By then other aircraft

My Minister does

development will be on the way. support the project.

A.B. Cause = pre-occupn in M/C.A. with U.S. aircraft: now being weaned

away.

84

and

P.M. Then will Minister see tht. his Dpt. &amp; B.O.A.C. support B. aircraft this project.

meant to substitute jet engines later.

E.B. Equal to anything U.S. have in contempln?

Agreed: Proceed with project.

P.M. Then by Def. Acts or Hybrid Bill?

b) Land Acqu. Bill wd. cover him too. Cdn’t that Bill be

E.B. See tht. our decision re

R.S.C. Reason for puttg. this into bldg. was our concn tht. we must experim.

with large aircraft. Had to put Cent. engines in first: always

We have nothg. else in prospect which cd. compete with U.S.

R.S.C. Yes: they are in fact copying it.

H.M. a) Cdn’t this, like Heathrow, be covered in C.A. Bill?

extended to cover M/Supply &amp; M/CA. (?)

General support for that.

Agreed: no hybrid Bill.

J.W. Ques. of time. We must start the runway this spring. Want

therefore to use Def. powers to acquire only runway land.

Rest can be brought under one or other of Bills at a) or b).

Barnes. Abolishing v. import. by-pass.

E.B. Use the Poles.

H.D. Wish to reserve ques. of B’tol airport. Agreed.

State airfields is said to prevent agreemt. with

B’tol Corpn.

A. Not so. Anyway that ques. is reserved.

10. Civil Aviation Bill. Have you considered RSC formula?

I.T. If Cab. rules against me, I want Parly Council to consider wtr. we shd.

P.M. Deal first with B/Trade point.

rely on Cl. 3(2) dirns vice new formula suggd by R.S.C. V. dangerous clause.

E.B. These Corpns may interlock with Europ. corpns. Some accessories may be made e.g. in Italy. Don’t want to be tied up too closely.

Support R.S.C. Don’t think of this problem wholly in terms

85

of U.S.A.

protn.

Even G.P.O. have never bn. restricted like this.

J.W. No objn to either alternative – so long as we secure tht. Corpns can’t

{manufacture

prev. agreed by Cab.

Don’t deliver yrself. into hands of manufrs., who aren’t nationalised. Effects on other forms of transport. Interests wd. demand similar

Awkward from F.O. point/view generally.

buy foreign aircraft w’out permn of Minister. Must be satisfd tht. Minister will give dirns to Corpns on the 3 pts., {acquisition

{execution of {major repairs

Corpns are disposed to rely on U.S. prodn – as, fr. operators’ pt. of view alone, is more convenient.

P.M. Cab. can so direct Minister at any time.

R.S.C. On ques. wtr. Cl. 3(2) wd. be enough – that Cl. is limited to functions.

E.Sh. Why set up a Bd. &amp; then hamstring them at every turn. R.S.C. clause is too restrictive. It’s wider then 4(1) – for that is limited to

foreign aircraft.

P.M. But that is discrimination. That’s why we widen it up.

E.Sh. Wd. rather have it on basis of preventg. purchase of foreign rather than regulating purchase of all.

A.B. Too much of powers of Corpn derive fr. Parlt. itself. More shd. be

Minister.

Half Agreed: Omit Cl. 4(1). Let Dpt. consider what amendmt.

be necessary also to use this power for full emplt.

A.V.A.

derived from Minister. Otherwise conflict betwn. Corpn &amp;

P.M. Minister shd. make the schemes – not Parlt.

required in Cl. 3 to cover the R.S.C. formula.

H.M. I still prefer R.S.C. formula: Parlt. will expect some explicit refce to this ques. of B. aircraft prodn. M/C.A. shd. want it too. May

Repairs – C/A. &amp; M/S. must consult together &amp; Cab. can decide.

A. &amp; Endorsed H.M.’s view.

Agreed: Accept R.S.C.’s formula vice Cl. 4(1).

P.M. Clauses 2 &amp; 3 cover it.

86

E.B. Why not decide – Delete Cl. 4(1): &amp; let Dpts consider wtr. any amendment of Cl. 3 required to give effect to

R.S.C.’s formula.

T.W. Clause 32. Shd. also be power to build farm bldgs. as well as houses.

I.T. Will do so.

P.M. Title: to cover B’tol Airport?

H.M. Legn Cttee can consider that.

H.M. Longer than I had hoped. Rigmarsh on pp 2-3 – cd. be done by

A. Why shd. M/C.A. decide if it is desirable?

A.B. Won’t do it w’out consultg. M/H. And only when l.a. won’t build.

P.M. Take that up at Legn Cttee.

subsequ. Regn. Open to much amendment.

R.S.C. If you appoint statutory Corpns you must define their job.

P.M. Put it in a Schedule.

[Exit Barnes, J.W. &amp; I. Thomas

I.T. Will consider that.

Enter J.B.H.

11. Level of German Industry. P.M. Preliminary discn with a few Ministers.

Have put in C.P. 115. – what our repve shd. say in Berlin, mainly to

para. 2 of memo.

a) 66½ m. is not factual estimate, but political compromise.

b) Level suggd = 1932 &amp; that was condns which produced Hitler.

d) Repns deliveries to Russia etc., are using resources (incldg. timber

E.B. Steel: now agreed at 7.5 m. capacity. Ty. paying now £80-90 m.p.a.

This scheme shd. reduce oblign in 2-3 years to about £25 m.

safeguard our financial posn. Potsdam decns reached on

assumption of unified Germany. And other conditions in

J.B.H. Attentn to followg. points –

If not realised we shd. have to demand revision.

c) Plan not agreed wth countries closely affected.

for packg.) which G. can ill spare.

Risk tht. R. is using this plan to weaken W. Germany.

87

(i) assurance of early apptmt of central adminn – so we don’t

(ii) review if posn contemplated isn’t realised.

These are the pts. to be borne in mind. But on the whole accept – if

have to carry too much in our Zone.

This, however, is the best we can get by quadripartite agreemt.

H.M. We may have to accept pro tem. as best we can get. But v. unhappy

about this &amp; its effects on European economy.

Need to control G’s war potential: but with least harm to her general

economy.

Financial prospects. Nothg. for occupation costs. We shall be £40 m.

Provision for elimn of synth. ammonia. Shd. be suspended until the

E.B. Year to year.

Can’t force R. further now

Heading for heavy unemployment – wh. smashed Weimar regime.

at least on wrong side of b) paymts. this year.

fertiliser posn is secured.

A.B. Revision?

H.D. Share H.M.’s apprehension: but believe this is best we can get now.

Instns in C.P. 115 give some safeguards. . But we can bring it up again at any time.

P.M. Agree. We were thrust into this attitude twds repns by our Allies.

getting.

A.B. We are being asked to accept a situation wh. we shall find it v. diff. to

H.D. Look again at timber generally. Agreed.

[Exit J.B.H. Enter. C.J.

Delay wd. be a gt. evil.

Can’t get away fr. it yet.

J. Need for potash &amp; timber.

E.B. Potash is in U.S. zones.

E.W. Packing. Cdn’t we ask R. to fetch it?

J.B.H. Are looking into this.

R.S.C. This is a starting-point; &amp; it’s a much better one than we looked like

explain to our people.

J.J.L. Welcome this as foreshadowing abandonment of Zone system.

88

12. Trans-Jordan. of B. troops.

(ii) Offrs. provided for discipline of Amir’s } C.O.

men shd. be paid for by him. }

E.Sh. Art. 2 of Annex. Does this safeguard us enough?

C.J. Yes: as wide as we can draw it.

J. Why appoint the Kings as plenipotentiaries for the Kings.

O.S. The names of plenipotentiaries will be filled in.

E.B. Want consultn with F.O. on Art. 6. Indicatg. tht. they invite presence

A. Art. 9(3) wd. include Newf. &amp; N. Rhodesia. Consult with C.O.
