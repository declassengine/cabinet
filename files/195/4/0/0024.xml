C.M. 36 (46) 17th April, 1946

1. Parliament.

P.M. Business for week after Easter Recess.

[Exit W.W.

2. World Wheat Supplies.

B.S. Summd memo.

U.S. shdn’t be allowed to cover their shortcomings by raiding our stocks. Favour public pressure for measures in para. 6. La. G. wd. back this.

Prospects for July-Sept. Supplies &amp; consumption economics need to meet deficit.

Effect on animal feeding stuffs.

Ask Cab. to adopt all measures recommended – but no public announcement.

Bread-rationing not possible before 15/7 &amp; wd. involve addl. staff of 6.000.

A’s ques. re wheat on farms. We assume ½ m tons at end/March, incldg. tailings &amp; unmillable: we expect 400,000 t. to mills. Stocks in bakers etc., can’t be estimated.

286.000 t. sent (all grains) to B. Zone/Germany from U.K.

T.W. Diff. memo to follow because large no. estimates not all of wh, may be realised. M/F suggest shortfall in Canadian supplies + need to maintain assumed

stock level &amp; consumption economics follow. Effect on livestock wd.

be catastrophic. With agreemt. of M/F I said 3 days ago in reply to

P.Q. tht. no redn in rations this summer: these proposals wd. involve

cut of 50%. Loss of even 140.000 t. coarse grain wd. mean cut of 1/3 rd

in animal feed rations.

What no. of weeks at reduced consumption levels.

My estimate of collection of wheat fr. farms = 400.000 t. in Aug &amp; Sept. giving 300.000 T. for milling – as cpd. with M/F. figure of 150.000 t.

Pessimistic forecast for winter shipments from Canada. 3 to 500.000 t. last year.

All-over demand for 900.000 + 400.000 flour constant stock.

Propose no. cut involvg. loss of animal feed before inter - departmental review of these estimates. 3 Agric. Dpts + M/F.

M/F. propose extn &amp; dilution (maximum effect on animals) at once: but bread rationing not until July.

P.M. Basic ques: what is minimum stock we must keep. On what figure of consumption is stock figure based.

Closing stock at 900.000 t. wheat. More than 11 wks. at present consumption

138

B.S. Peak &amp; valley. Must have this insurance. Para. 23

E. Sh. Memo. is based on assumptions that we shan’t get supplies fr. Canada, U.S.

and Argentine. Sec. of para.12: but calculation then based on

assumption of only 150.000 t.

B.S. MacIvor has said only 50.000 t. in next 2 months.

A. Perplexing feature: 150.000 t. fr, Canada is assumed by this memo. But

y’day told 285.000 for May/June and 200.000 for July/August. This =

970.000 t. wh. is v. diff. from 150.000t. Must know wh. is the more

reliable before we take these drastic decisions.

E.Sh. Para. 12 deals with Canadian supply – but it blows hot &amp; cold.

B.S. Deficit of 430.000 t. even if we got the 970.000 t. from Canada.

Hutton says Gardener expects more.

Own farms: Aug./Sept. 400,000 t. Believe tht. in May-July we cd. get a good deal more than this 400.000. Shdn’t these figures come into a/c also.

I can’t get firm figures.

P.M. Being done.

J. And Dpts. consider figures.

P.M. Distilling is stopping already?

B.S. Yes. Barley: for Beer. Saving of …..

E.W. Dilution with barley wd. cause waste.

E.B. Assume you risk 100.000 t. contn to pool and introduce more of these

economies, &amp; you will have 6 wks. stock at end/Sept. And home

harvest will then be coming in.

What are these risks compd with sinkings?

A.B. Assume all pessimistic assumptn are realised, &amp; no economics introduced, what wd. be stocks at end/Sept?

B.S. Practically nil.

J. Choice: What risk shall be take? These estimates are only instructed guesses. Yet M/F recommends policy wh. he admits is disastrous to livestock.

Why not cut loaf by 10%

A. Don’t do it.

Tragedy to introduce any of these measures.

139

B.S. But then there were huge stocks in exporting countries.

P.M. Stocks fr. N. America will be moving in September, won’t it?

B.S. But I can’t rely on U.S. guarantees.

U.S. harvest begins in June &amp; cd. begin to reach U.K. in July.

H.D. Get Canadian supply estimate on Ministerial level via MacIvor.

E.B. Then you won’t get 25% set-aside order in U.S.

Tel. fr. Halifax. State Dpt. are in diffy. over 25% proposal. Pressure against

it: higher levels of U.S. adminn are wobbling. They are being asked

what other countries are doing. Anything further we can say will be

helpful. ? Once concerted statement vice

A.B. M/F. rightly called attenn to risk – our stocks falling when world stocks low. But we shdn’t accept certain calamity for sake of calamities wh. will never occur. And Cab. shd. take collective respons. for risking it.

E.W. Extraction rate. Effect on school milk. Wd. affect health of children.

P.M. Immediate ques: what do we say to C.F.B. to-day?

B.S. Nothing.

Insist on firm guarantees. unilateral statement by 3

countries.

If they fail to carry their 25% proposal, don’t let them ride out on grd. that

we

Equivalent action here wd. be 200.000 t. from our stocks. wd. do nothing. Let it be their failure.

He now wants informn on specific points – read out.

Wants to know what consumption economies we offer to match their 25%.

P.M. Preferable to put our 200,000 t. against the 25%.

Handed in note given to Winnant on 16/4.

P.M. What more do we need!

E.B. Tell Hutton 100.000 stands. If he gets 2.3 confirmed, he can go up to 200,000 as against firm guarantees. Give him scope in discussion – as a negotiating method.

B.S. Hutton now says 285.000 fr. Canada in May &amp; June dropping to 114.000 in July &amp; August.

What supplies do we ask U.S. for? – return of 200.000 t. + any Canadian shortfall.

Agreed: despatch telegram on above lines.

[Exit Barnes, B.S.

3. Future of the Ruhr. Early thought re

E.B. R. favoured centralised adminn in Germany: included in P. Protocol. Fr. posn was reserved by us at P. But Fr. have always repudiated Potsadm agreements. Ruhr. Talk of socialisation of indies in Saxony: we don’t

now what is happening.

Thought then of economic separation. Heart of G. war. making power –

financed &amp; organised G. wars. If R. prodn left for Germany alone, war

will follow.

Looked at it again in light of draft Treaty.

Idea of international holding co. Reluctantly abandoned because diffies

which F.O. found in it incldg. prob. views of Dutch, Belgians etc.

Political: Communists in G. makg. play with out intentn to separate Ruhr.

Communists in France makg. play with need to separate.

Many snags to be got over. But must start to talk to other Govts. Wd.

Cabinet support me on these lines.

C.O.S. views.

Diffces with Belgian &amp; Dutch. Rotterdam can’t survive w’out production

Ruhr. Drifting to economic ruin. Dutch are scared stiff of

consequences of Fr. solution.

H.M. Best solution. Prefer Germany public corpn subject to pol. control. The other

solution wd. have brght. R. in permanently. Worth trying.

H.D. Was attracted by earlier plan. Start of an international requirm.

At Lanc. House Bidault demanded pol. Sepn of Ruhr. Have resisted that on financial &amp; economic grds.

From 11 to 33m. tons expansion in steel prodn betwn. the wars.

Reparations agreement: level of G. prodn: steel at 7.5m. But when we took 11m. as our aim, we assumed ammonia plant wd. be closed. Found we can’t close them because we wd. have to buy fertilisers for them with dollars. Forced to this, at expense of security.

Draft U.S. Treaty. Four power commn to give security v. G. aggression to other Europ. powers – w’in U.N.O. framework.

Come back to original idea. Separate Province. So designed tht. it cd. be fitted into a Federal G. or, otherwise, cd. remain as it is. Pol. &amp; mil. control for many years. Advantages: Germans wd. feel their bosses had gone. Wd. be like our Coal Bd.

Gomin’s speech, Harvey found split betwn. Gomin &amp; Bidault.

Fr. our angle, we shd. be very vulnerable to a renascent warlike Germany. But doubt is she will go that way.

Ready to consider any better plan.

Greatest threat on long view = gt. mass of Germans. Fearful therefore of lettg. Germans control Ruhr w’out lasting international control. Ownership wd. have given us lasting interest.

Risk of forgiving our enemies.

Can we get G. Socialists into controlling posn in west. Disappointed that diffics of consortium have proved too much for E.B.

141

P.M. If Germans are to run this, who will they be? Not Social Democrats: they

won’t know how. Fear it will be G. technicians &amp; industrialists: the

old gang. When control removed, will fall into Nazi hands.

E.Sh. They will be so efficient they will be able to export coal at a price

disadvantageous to us. Afraid of Nazification.

Russian menace can’t be set aside.

H.M. Directors apptd by no. of Govts. – not likely to be successful, is it?

Preferred E.B.’s original consortium plan.

Our line shd. be to cement friendship with W. Europe. Need a strong industrialised France.

E.B. My consortium wdn’t be French.

Diffy is – can you go on permanently with an internatl control system. We must decide whr we are trying to make G. an enlightened Social democracy: or clear out in a few years, giving it all up? If we cd. succeed in makg. G. a democracy it wd. be a gt. comfort to our foreign policy.

J. We must attach France to ourselves: allay her fears. Real International control, therefore: not a German national co. subject only to a system of international control wh. experience shows will be relaxed after a few years.

C.E. No Social Democrats can be found in G. to wh. control cd. be handed over. Favour international co.

A.B. Decide acc. to ultimate policy re Germany. Need to avoid creatg. Nationalist revulsion – wh. we shd. provoke by carving up G., internationalisg. the Ruhr etc.

Russia is starting United Germany movemt. – will put themselves on side of

G. masses. Give G. a healthy psych. context. Avoid causes of

grievance. Can’t hold G. down for ever.

Must stimulate growth of democracy.

A.B. Policy sh. be to take our chances of getting G. industries socialised, but

leave them German.

Potsdam levels wd. have

Fr. attitude unreasonable. G. irredentism due to French policy of this kind after 1918.

P.M. Circs. in Germany diff. to-day from 1918.

The small economic group is the war like danger.

E.W. Support E.B.’s memo. because it is realistic. Accepts the fact tht. Europe is being divided. If we want to promote democracy in G. we must provide an alternative to (?) Russia. to be altered if we ran this as a Province efficiently.

It wd. be the answer to R. case – what are you doing in W. cpd with our

efforts in E.

142

Want also to relieve Exch. of trading costs.

E.B. Cd. we marry the two? Wd. like the Provincial Govt. Don’t know re.actions of Belg. Dutch &amp; Fr. – more concerned with them than Russia. Must begin elections in Germany U.S. zone Gauleiter system: won’t do for us. We’ve had municipal elections: but not big enough to make a splash.

If principle of Prov. Govt. accepted, I wdn’t w’hold fr. Western Govts. the consortium idea.

Cd. put both alternatives to them.

Robertson &amp; Strang favoured second course.

But cd. I have latitude?

J.B.H. One thing is clear: can’t go on with no policy.

B adminn. Can’t do Ruhr with present staffs. For coal eg. we now have to get Fr. experts.

Urgent: for we have to get industry going up to agreed level.

[Fr. attitude. Marcel Paul told me Commm. in France support Gomin’s attitude.] Must oppose Fr. plan. For wd. involve complete review of Potsdam levels.

Choice is: pacify France (short-term ambitions) but antagonise Russia.

E.Sh’s fear for coal competn. Agreed levels wd. put them out of competn for

years. Risk of Nazification: alternative Commm or Nazi. thro’

Communist. Don’t pay too much attentn to views of people who live in

G. ???? etc. I have seen Social Democr. mtgs. wh. wd. have filled

Albert Hall: v. striking how many are coming fwd.

Right to nationalise – diffics because P. Protocol v. stabilising concentns of

industrial power.

Consortium. Control Commn adminn (quadripartite) can’t run an industry.

No diffy. in establ. Province &amp; Prov. Govt.

Para. 7. Don’t think we can keep R. out. At end/occupn 3 w. Powers to stay &amp; R. to go: wdn’t be acceptable to them.

E.B. Saxony is answer to that.

Agreed: Discuss both alternatives with Western Powers. before taken up with 4 occupying Powers.

Memo. on Policy twds. Germany under prepn for Cabinet.

[Exit H.M.

4. Trusteeship

A. Need to get guidance before D.P.M. mtg. Want to p’pone until second week.

P.M. Must wait until Thursday next.
