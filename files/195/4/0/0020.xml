C.M. 32 (46) 10th April, 1946

World Food Situation

P.M. Indications tht. U.S. are going back on allocations &amp; seekg. to put that on us.

a) Hoover thinks food shd. go into Poland – anti-Russian.

B.S. No faith in any guarantees from U.S.

P.M. Consumption p.m.?

E.B. In current world situations, how can I justify 2 months stock replenished at

this rate.

B. Cost of interruptg. import/export p’mmes.

E.B. But we are trying for firm guarantees. Ques. is what price can be paid for

firm guarantees. If we make a firm offer, U.S. will largely follow us.

b) La Guardia for U.N.R.R.A. – Kaliano

c) Dislike of India.

Cereals &amp; oils &amp; fats.

E.B. Informtn last night. Now telegrams from Halifax.

Read them out. Tues 2271-73.

These don’t mention bread rationing – threatened by La G. We thought last night that on this our line shd. be “we will ration if Canada &amp; U.S. will do so.”

From U.S. only 208.000 t of which 100.000 received. This is all L.F.C. was to get fr. U.S. Canadian supplest to U.K. are to be halved over next 3 months.

Must save 100.000 t. for bldg. up stocks v. the winter. By 30/9 I must have 900.000 t in stock. Must find 600,000 t betwn. now and 30/9.

B.S. 250.000t or 41/2M. p.a. in U.K.

B.S. 750.000t was minimum pre-war – when you cd. rely on rapid replenishment.

P.M. But face posn as seen from U.S. – other countries with much lower stocks.

B.S. Small countries find it easier. Belgium is comparable &amp; she wants 7 wks.

P.M. But won’t get it. If some countries have v. small stocks, can we justify ours?

A.B. Can further transport guarantees be obtd. for rapid replacement.

A.B. Problem is general, not ours only: if transport pooling can also be arranged.

B. No readiness h’to to pool shipping. U.S. promised 1M. this month: and achieved only 1/2M.

116

What condn can we make – can we run a risk at 8 wks. supply if firm

undertakg. we will be maintained at that. We now have 11 wks. incldg

plant. Put the balance in the pool: if we get guaranteed shipping

p’mme for import of 450.000t p.m. to keep us steady at 8 wks. Firm

bargain – not a resoln.

Add that, if they will ration, we will.

Can’t take these risks.

Argentine – if Rank can’t get wheat out, no one can.

ii) Strikes.

E.B. And can we be sure of getting it unilaterally.

If we have to yield more of our theoretical wheat, we want a quid pro quo,

viz. tht. eventual allocns will be actual &amp; delivered.

B.S. Since Tele. 2271-3, in wh. we co-operated, Hutton has telephoned tht. we

can’t count on supplies fr. Canada. He thinks therefore tht. we can’t

afford to take the line in Tels. 2271-3. Suggests we say we can’t help

– others must do so. And go for public announcement in Canada of 2-

year contract at 1.55$.

Cd. we exclude home harvest – reserve at 30,000t a wk. That wd. cover biscuits etc. If they will exempt home harvest fr. the calculn &amp; maintain us at 8 wks., we cd. do a deal.

And get ahead with mission to Argentine.

B.S. Haven’t got the men yet.

Prefer to call the bluff on rationing - &amp; await reply.

Don’t be hustled by Hoover &amp; La. G.

What’s the use of asking U.S. for guarantees? They will fall down, as now.

i) interval transport.

E.B. What if U.S. cut us to-day?

B.S. Make a deal with Canada.

P.M. Will that carry us over.

P.M. And what about India &amp; Germany.

B.S. They won’t get anything anyway.

E.B. That won’t do. That is M/F. responsibility for U.K. only.

T.W. Allocations are meaningless if ours is cut to 1.9. w’out consultn.

B.S. It hasn’t bn. cut yet. Discn to-day starts on 2.3 figure.

T.W. In that event, we cd. take a gamble on stocks as proposed.

A.B. We know they are going to try to cut our allocns.

But know they haven’t fulfilled delivery promises.

117

1) Offer to ration bread if they will (U.S. &amp; Canada) } Agreed.

Make it public here if offer made at this mtg. }

B.S. Long-term Canadian contract. I wd. like to carry 1.55$ guarantee from Dec. ’47 to cover 1947 harvest. i.e. June 1948. That will fetch it out. Publish in Canada.

Agreed. T.W. M/F cd. agree with Gardiner on minimum quantities. And that will fetch it

out.

A.B. Favour fwd. buying in principle – guarantee purchase price for primary

producers.

E.B. Must have Cab. ruling tht. in reviewg. world wheat situation, we shall have

regard to Commonwealth requiremts. not to those of U.K. alone.

H.D. Cd. we say that at that price we will buy the lot? – all you can let us have.

B.S. No: because if there is cheaper wheat elsewhere I want to be free to buy it.

B.S. Don’t risk losing grain market. Don’t therefore offer to take the lot – minimum quantity.

H.D. But talk big.

A. Supported – that is fundamental.

B.S. Agreed.
