C.M. 53(46). 30th May, 1946.

1. Parliament.

H.M. Business for next week.

2. World Food Supplies: Food Debate.

Pro: will leak anyway.

A. Beware of hoarding flour.

Debate of 31/5. Food. Now will cover, not only W’ton discns, but

also adminn of M/F. generally. Suggest therefore that M/F. shd.

spk. 2nd &amp; I will wind up. Later: acc. to W.S.C. opening: if he

does, H.M. shd. follow, at once.

Shd. he announce decision in principle to introduce bread rationing?

Con: say only we are preparing it, won’t introduce unless essential,

think it may.

H.M. Might appeal to co-opn.

J.J.L. The flour doesn’t keep. Warn them it’s no good buying it in. Must

avoid a rush on flour &amp; letting it go bad on their hands.

P.M. B’cast between now &amp; 21/7 –

J.S. Yes: on adminve method of doing it. When we have announced a

definite decision.

J.W. Stale bread order.

J.S. Will consider: but 90% extr. bread can’t be eaten stale.

H.M. Compliments to W’ton Embassy, esp. Makins, for handling of

“misunderstanding”.

[Exit W.W. &amp; A.G.

3. Rations of Animal Feeding – stuffs. If we don’t do that we must put a further 15% cut on all animals.

T.W. Since last discn further review. Forecast even worse. Satisfd now we

must adopt worst assumption.

Specl. attentn to cut for pig clubs dom. poultry: 1½ m. families:

2 vice 5 lbs. p. bird p. mouth = 50% cut in birds wh. can be fed.

We cd. quickly raise coupon values if posn improved. Prepare

therefore for the worse.

222

J.W. Endorsed.

Fear it may mean more than 5% loss of milk. For because of drought

Enter J.B.H. and de Freitas.

there is v. little feed in Scotland.

T.W. We shall enlist co-opn of farmers.

J.S. Support.

P.M. Collection of swill – is it going as well as previously? Look into this,

in consultn with B/Trade.

[Exit J.S.

H.McN.

4. Marriages Between British Service-men &amp; Alien Women.

J.J.L. As in memo.

C-in-C must be consulted because security. But my personal view is:

Air Miny to exercise the discretion: but ready to leave it to

J. Believe it is “legal”. C-in-C. has requisite authy. as i/c troops.

pregnant. Don’t like saying that is not an exceptional case.

red looses hers. G. women will go out for this – even offering

Supposing a soldier contracts a marriage: it isn’t invalidated merely

Further point – is this legal? This is being raised in H/C.

time to abolish this ban altogether &amp; leave it all to discretion of

C-in-C. For Germany.

For Japan: wd. have to get views of Doms. &amp; U.S.

de Fr. Agree with W.O. Germany: permit in exceptional cases. Wd. prefer

C-in-C if desired for sake of uniformity.

H.D. What are the exceptional cases?

J.J.L. Pregnancy: or anti-Nazi sympathies.

Find it diff. to defend w’holding consent when the woman is

E.W. Marriage confers B. nationality. Yet a B. woman marrying a Spanish

money.

C.E. And we don’t allow an alien marrying B. woman to acquire thereby

a right to remain in U.K.

because C-in-C. has refused his consent.

P.M. Opens v. diff. points. Will enable many ex-enemy women to become

B. when we refuse citizenship to alien men who fought for us.

Don’t encourage G. women to go for marriage.

J.J.L. Will Cab. agree except for G. &amp; J. : &amp; let me explore security point

with C-in-C. 223

P.M. If you base it on moral or H.O. grounds, G. &amp; J. aren’t diff. from

Austria etc.

E.W. Cdn’t we legislate to prevent these women acquiring B. naty.

J. Not w’out v. careful considn, with Doms.

C.E. Can’t do it in advance of Dom. consultn on nationality.

P.M. This shd. have bn. discussed with F.O., H.O., D.O. before submn to

Cabinet.

H.McN. E.B. did consider personally &amp; agreed.

J.B.H. Subject to security, I wd. favour enabling marriages to take place.

H.O. to convene Ministers concerned &amp; make further report.

[Exit de Freito

5. Non-Italian Refugees in Italy. Dragged to concln we must choose betwn. 2 unpleasant alternatives:

them.

P.M. Not to G. Same objn as to removal of Poles – worsen relations

joint agreement. Trying to find accommn for balance of 1 m. of

U.S. to keep 50% permanently: if we brght foreigners fr. Italy

responsibilities.

H.McN. As in memo.

a) send them to Germany or b) keep more soldiers there to guard

H.M. Why do we have to look after all foreigners in trouble?

Why not let Yugoslavs &amp; Italians solve it betwn. them?

H.D. Agreed. Improvident good nature: can’t afford it.

with USSR.

Why shd. we keep them.

H.D. F.O. press us a) to unilateral charity b) increased subs. to intern. relief.

J.B.H. Still obliged to receive 1½ m. Germans from Poland: in accordce with

these. Also 180.000 G. fr. U.S. zone, of whom we’ve persuaded

U.S. wd. recant on that.

Security. Control of d.p.’s is biggest problem in G. to-day. This wd.

aggravate it. Hard core of 200.000 d.p.’s for whom we’d have

to provide in the end: can’t afford to add these Yugoslavs to it.

J.J.L. U.S. are equally responsible for these Y. Make them face their

224

P.M. Why keep them nr. frontier. Let Italy look after them – e.g. in

We can’t disarm them – no B. troops to do it.

let Ital. Govt. assume the responsibility:] E.B. can

[ ] is the view of Cabinet.

6. Leakage of Information.

Sardinia.

J. Don’t consult U.S. Put it firmly on Italy. Disarm them &amp; let Italy

look after them.

H.McN. This wasn’t charity.

I thght of Sardinia: but they wd. terrorise the island – no police there.

C.E. We shd. have to take the remanent in U.K. in the end.

Agreed: [don’t bring them to Germany, let them stay in Italy:

raise it again if he chooses.

[Exit J.B.H. &amp; H.McN.

J. Reported enquiries re leak about decision to bring Polish troops to

U.K.

No ground for thinking this leak came from Cab. pp. in U.K.

P.M. F.O. shd. enquire into this.

Recent case where something said at Def. Cttee in passing was on
