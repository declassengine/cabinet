C.M. 98(46). 19th November, 1946.

1. Indonesia: Political Settlement.

H.McN. Agreement reached in Batavia. Not operative until endorsed by

2. Food: Butter for Canada.

Govt. &amp; prs. Parlt.

Commrs. leavg. 22/11. Hope signature by 2/12.

Both sides complimentary to our good offices.

P.M. Have sent message to Killearn. Will also send to Inverchapel

when its thro’.

J.S. Want F.O. to tell me with whom to negotiate for food – want to

jump in quickly.

H.McN. Will inform M/F.

have vol. rationed themselves for our sake – earlier trouble over

diversion to U.S. Army. But if we can square them, we hope

future supplies.

A. None.

fat, as cpd. with our 1 oz.

Real danger = upsetting S. Doms. And N.Z. also have an election on.

Doesn’t in itself alter our rations: only stocks. But we are in no

A. As in memo. Main issue for D.O. = reaction in Austr. &amp; N.Z. They

M/F. will spare the butter for Canada. We shd. have to consult

the 3 High Commrs. Can’t do anything which wd. imperil our

P.M. Canada’s 6oz. No margarine?

J.S. Our fat ration = 6. same as theirs. But they have unlimited cooking

posn to make a flat refusal to Canada: for they are supplying us so much with other foods. They must get willing concurrence of Austr. &amp; N.Z. but if they can get it I think we shd. give Canada what she wants in butter.

E.Sh. Cdn’t we get cooking fats fr. Canada as quid pro quo.

[Enter J.B.H. &amp; S.G.

3. Socialisation of Ruhr Industries.

P.M. 3 points – as in brief.

407

H.McN. Apologise that S.G. not consulted before printing.

(a) 3 Stage Plan. Buys time for consn of complex issues of ownership.

Also plenty of time to work out adjustment to Stage C.

S.G. Scheme shd. be satisf. qua law. Custody won’t involve trouble.

Stage B. will involve practical rather than legal problems.

qua

Stage C. How compel Land Govt. to pass this legisln – awkward

to frame constitn so as to require this. C-in-C. can control it, sovereign power, in Stages A. &amp; B. He will have to secure

in B. effects for C.

E.Sh. If control with C-in-C., only a limited power will rest in G. authy.

intentns.

German authy recommends

R.S.C. Custody plan gets over my immediate diffies. Shall have to work out legal complexities before Stage B.

J. No comment. Cd. I be consulted on all these legal issues?

P.M. Ld. Chanc. shd. be brought in; on all such occasions.

Won’t that be regarded as eye-wash. What substance in it?

Custodians won’t be free to act. Must define powers.

H.McN. Stage A: no transfer of control. Only political gesture – earnest of

Also a first stage in a process declared as our policy.

A.B. Importce of decln that industries aren’t revertg. to private ownership.

E.W. Who will see tht. custodians are type of people we want to encourage?

H.McN. F.O. &amp; Control Office, with P.M. approval.

H.M. Someone shd. go over from here who can advise C-in-C.

P.M. C-in-C. will act on instructns of H.M.G. : C-in-C. appoints.

Must be settled by someone going out from here &amp; settling.

(b) Responsibility: to Land Govt. or central Govt. H.McN. E.B. prefers Land Govt. i) security: in our control.

economy as whole. Too much for Land Govt. Also prejudges

the Zone.

ii) de-centralisation. iii) Fr. makg. diffies over Ruhr. Their case will be considered lost if this comes under central Govt.

J.B.H. Interfce with G. economy gone far enough. These are assets of G.

issue wtr. there shall be any central Govt.

Prefer therefore corporns responsible to Cttee of 3 Lander Govt. in 408

Consultn with N. Rh. – W. Govt. won’t mean bringing G. politics in properly. Therefore not all-Party.

centre wd. not be. Can’t allow one-party Govt. in small area to

R.S.C. Second thoughts: para. 9 indicates legn in Stage B. Cd. such legn be

P.M. Consistent with our policy of encouraging de-centralisation.

as political.

You can get all control thro’ C-in-C. Consult therefore as widely as

possible.

P.M. But scheme contemplates corpns estd by law. If no more than

A. Sympathy with widening it up to whole Zone. But no Govt. can

protect custodians fr. actions.

P.M. Your arguments look to central Govt. Why not one-party Govt. in

centre, as you say in Land.

J.B.H. One-party Govt. in only a Land is objectionable, as one-party Govt. in

control so important an asset.

R.S.C. Won’t be a central Govt. in Stage B.

Final transfer of ownership not until Stage C.

Only ques. for Stage B = whom you consult on apptmt of

custodians.

J.B.H. More diff. to get on to national basis if you begin with Land Govt.

passed by wider authy than Land Govt.

E.Sh. Socialisation, to be a success, can’t be compartmental – must be of

interest to all inhabitants of B. Zone. Peace potential of these

indies to whole of B. Zone. Consider economic implicns, as well

consultn you don’t pass beyond Stage A.

R.S.C. Ques: what legal basis for corpns in Stage B. Crux is: how do you

compensate G. shareholders. Under memo. Land Govt. will be

responsible. That gives Land Govt. gt. claim to eventual

ownership. Cd. you empower 3 Land Govts. to compensate?

H.M. Why bother overmuch about compensating these owners.

R.S.C. Must say who will be respons. for paying compensn if any.

H.M. No: why not confiscate?

answer for whole Zone. Why not create Zone Govt.

H.McN. Some G. authy will have to handle G. claims. No Zonal authy cd.

P.L. Are the industries all in one Land? 409

McN. We so designed this Land. Confiscation raises big issues. If you do

it, you will be presentg. big gift to corpn – cui bono. J.B.H. Wd. also prejudge ques. of central Govt.

Appointment of custodians – by someone

J.B.H. Compn – for many things incldg. war damage – will be problem for a

German Govt. Doesn’t arise on this.

McN. Why no Zonal Govt? Because purely artificial military boundary.

P.M. All the arguments in favour of widening up to Zone apply to

widening it up to all Germany.

Real ques. is can Land Govt. give legal existce to corpns w’out

tying them eventually to Land. If so, Stage B. falls down. You

are back on Stage A &amp; have to abandon idea of transferring any

responsibility to a German authy.

Conceptn of memo. was to make Corpn respons. to a G. authy. If no

authy other than Land Govt. it can’t work. Either Land Govt. or

C-in-C. Stage B. is impossible unless you accept Land Govt.

J. Can we get further now than Stage A.

Agreed: Stage A: appoint custodians, after consultn with repves

of all Lander Govt.

going out from here chosen in consultn with

P.M. He shd. report back to Cabinet.

P.M. Cab. view = Land Govt. is not big enough orgn to wh. to entrust the

Ruhr industries.

Agreed: Foreign Observers doesn’t arise.

Memo. on a Zonal Govt.

[Exeunt McN. O.S. S.G. J.D.H.

[Enter G.T. Barnes. Leonard.

4. Winter Fuel Supplies for Industry.

E.Sh. Anxious to avoid public statement re coal. Will cause disquiet.

Official plan wd. involve public announcement.

Prefer cut of 10% vice

Allocations based on requirements: can’t revise them w’out

announcement: can, however, vary deliveries v. unchanged

allocations. Can tell firm you will get only 80% etc., of

allocation for x months: that is continn of normal procedure. 12½ % in official plan.

operate? By check on meters.

Electricity &amp; gas. My plan goes further than official’s. The danger is

greater here. My plan doesn’t appear as a cut. How will it

Expect to save more than official plan wd. have saved.

R.S.C. History. E.Sh. said cuts requd &amp; suggd consultn on means. I said

do this thro’ N.P.A.C.I. We did this. Industry (&amp; I) are 410

insistent tht. cuts be so made tht. industry can plan ahead over

winter. Otherwise chaos. Present system: allocations on

below allocns – in Midlands 36% below. E.Sh. wants cuts on

what they wd. have consumed. Tried in W/England in war – got

I prefer the official plan.

Gas &amp; electricity: official plan. Rest on consumer’s estimate. We

criterion. Suggest provn Dec. 45 – Mar. 46. etc., (not understood).

G.T. Claim for total exemption of bldg. materials industries.

Suggn tht. 5% cut can be met by fuel economy is true of most indies.

Keep it as elastic as possible. New factories coming into prodn.

Flexibility in case it does create unemployment.

G.A.I. Preference anyhow for developmt. areas. In other areas prodn cd.

screened requirements – desirable maximum. Deliveries do run

those deliveries, which are below allocns &amp; uncertain. Must have

a scheme wh. will tell industries what they will get. Publicity is

therefore necessary. No pool for hard cases – unless you have

the 12 ½% cut of official plan. That was valuable feature of

official plan.

Officials’ plan was sensible because of i) publicity ii) pool.

Gas &amp; electricity. Can’t assume industry will be static as measured

by Nov. Think of new firms startg. e.g. in developmt. areas: on

rising prodn curve. We don’t think you can clamp down on basis

of Nov. figures. Scheme adopted in war was to direct redn below

98% response.

To get good-will of industry, we must in any event consult again with

N.P.A.C.I. if we are to modify scheme discussed with them.

M/S. We concur with R.S.C.

prefer then M/F. &amp; P. scheme. Save tht. we doubt if Nov. is best

Barnes. No “breakdown” in transport, as stated in E. Sh. memo.

Progress in prodn is slow: will be stopped by 5% fuel cut.

Can be met by cutting space-heating. But doesn’t apply to most

bldg. materials indies.

All round 5% cut wd. have opp. effect to that desired. Wd. produce

7 times the effect in some brick-works than in another. Also

glass: can’t cut 10% for technical reasons.

H.D. Need for quick action. Too many words.

Impressed by R.S.C. Offl. plan concerted with T.U.C. &amp; F.B.I. Cd.

be adopted w’out delay. The other plan wd. have to be

negotiated with N.P.A.C.I. – further delay.

R.S.C. That is point of 12½%.

be re-arranged. Set-back in d. areas wd. be disastrous.

H.M. There was consultn with industry.

Against this, see some advantages in E.Sh. alternative. 411

Can’t put another scheme into effect w’out consultn with N.P.A.C.I.

Steel: M/S. shd. aim at more pig iron &amp; less scrap, to economise coal.

must be public announcement. Effect of curtailing expansn in

to be re-adjusted. 167.000 t. of coal involved. Wd. cause

Exemption for bldg. indies. Lay the cut on luxury prodn.

consumer goods.

T.W. Ag. machinery. Firms just coming into prodn. If they are to be cut

Period for 9. &amp; electricity: Dec. - March better criterion than Nov.

Subject to these reservations, prefer E.Sh. scheme.

A.B. Gloom in M/W. about this cut. If applied to bldg. industries, there

those indies will be disastrous. Whole housing p’mme wd. have

unemplt in light castings, built up with so much difficulty.

R.S.C. That reflects on everything. E.g. cuts in clothing ration: less

Only hope is to spread as widely as possible so as to make the cut as

little as poss. on each.

12½%, disastrous for agric. &amp; exports.

P.M. Distinguish betwn. manuf. by coal &amp; use of coal for heating.

E.Sh. a) Let me discuss my plan with N.P.A.C.I.

b) Provn for appeal to Fuel Offr. e.g. by bldg. indies. Provides elasticity

as Officials’ plan doesn’t.

History. Fuel Effic. Confn asked for 10% vol. saving. P.M. asked me

to be quick (Oct. minute). B/T. asked about allocns.

Met N.P.A.C.I. They weren’t enthusiastic over scheme.

Accepted with greatest reluctance. Have always said I doubted

apprehensions re winter coal: want therefore flexible plan.

El. &amp; gas: I can save more by my plan.

P.M. How long wd. a) take? Must be quick.

R.S.C. seeks elasticity via 12½% and pool. E.Sh. relies on greater

prodn.

E.Sh. Make a pool: you invite demands on it.

Agreed: as at a) &amp; b) in E.Sh. above.

H.M. Coal Production Publicity. All agreed. But Ty. say Coal Bd. shd.

pay. And they can’t pay yet. Can’t we start: &amp; let finance

be settled later.

H.D. Won’t be diff. over small sum until Coal Bd. establd. So long as

understood Coal Bd. pays when establd.

Agreed: in principle.

[Exeunt invitees for 4.

Enter P.M.G.

412

5. Indian Services. Compensation to Officers.

Agreed – as in memo. 413
