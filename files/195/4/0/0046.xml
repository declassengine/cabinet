C.M. 60 (46) 20th June, 1946

1. Parliament

H.M. Business for next week.

A. H/Lds. Coal Bill – some trouble. Going to discuss with E.Sh. and H.D. Shd. finish soon.

H.M. Shd. we consider what to do when H/Lds. get difficult

J. Bill to give H/C. last word on H/L. amendmts.

A. Don’t believe trouble will come for a year or 2.

H.M. This Bill must start soon if we are to force it thro’ under Parlt. Act this Parlt.

H.M. Then it may be too late to work Parlt. Act.

H.D. Reduce delay under Partl. Bill fr. 2 years to same Session.

P.M. But rejection on 2nd Reading – wdn’t then come back to H/C.

x/. J. shd. consider what shd. be done. /x

Agreed as at x/.

[Exit W.W.

[Enter C.O.S. &amp; N.B.

2. Palestine He categor. denied any commn. betwn. Agency &amp; Hagana – dissociated

himself from Stern Grp. &amp; Irgun Zwei Leumi. Not so clear abt. some

Hagana troops. Mtg. him again to-day.

P.M. E.B. was to talk to Byrnes early this a.m. &amp; let me know.

G.H. Telegram fr. High Commr. Kidnapping – on top of worsening situation – has created diff. posn with B. troops.

With P.M.’s consent, I sent for Ben Gurion y’day p.m. – v. diff. attitude on his part. Seemed genuinely distressed, particularly at kidnapping, &amp; agreed to issue a statement of regret etc. (as in Times). Cpd. with his attitude over last 6 months, this shows anxiety at recent sitn in Pal.

H. Commr. has asked for 6 mos. past for powers to deal with situation. In Jan. decided we shdn’t search for arms. Later, after Tel. Aviv murders, H. Commr. asked for discretion to put into opn plan for cleaning up illegal J. organns. Def. Cttee decided H.M.G. must retain this discretion. H. Commr now feels v. deeply. Promised not to act unless he must.

His power to act might, however, act as deterrent.

247

For 9 mos. Agency has bn. un-cooperative. And until y’day made no

statemt. of regret or renunciation.

a) because we haven’t admd we will allow the 100,000 to go.

b)

Damage to rlways.

G.H. Has asked him to name those whom he wd. arrest.

Believe H.C. shd. now have this discretion.

P.M. H.G. suggn of brkg. off discns re 100,000. Wrong.

brkg. off discns with U.S. is a poor way of bringing pressure on Jews.

Saw Harriman y’day – suggested earlier arrival of Grady’s party.

Limit to what B. troops can stand. May be trouble with them. Diff. to deny this discretion to H.C.

Awkward tht. Mufti shd. now turn up &amp; in Egypt.

[Exit A.G.

C.I.G.S. Tel. from Paget, supporting H. Commrs request.

Reached stage at wh. can’t put more strain on troops.

Signal of 19/6 – puttg. Jewish places out of bounds: walking in pairs etc.

Another signal – search of settlement: possn of arms admitted.

Kidnapped 5 in Tel Aviv. One more officer missing: &amp; one nursing sister.

C.O.S. consider freedom of action shd. now be given to C. in C. M/E. and H.C.

Simultaneous disarmament of Arabs. We can manage Jews. But if we are beginning to implement Anglo. Am. Cttee Rpt. Fr. mil. angle better to confirm action to Jews &amp; base it on retribution for recent action.

N.B. F.O. consider – don’t brk. off Anglo. U.S. talks: do accelerate 2nd party.

We think H.C. shd. be given discretion now. “Hostages” is worse than murder.

But Ben Gurion’s denial of contact with Hagana. Mil. plan was based on assumptn tht. Agency controls Hagana - &amp; involves seizing offices of Agency &amp; arrestg. their leaders. That wd. cause trouble in U.S. Cd. we avoid doing that part?

P.M. Not clear whr. H.C. intends to go for Agency.

T.W. Cdn’t Ben Gurion (v. influential on Agency) persuade Agency to declare tht. until attacks cease &amp; hostage released they won’t negotiate with U.K. &amp; U.S. Govt.

G.H. He wdn’t go so far. Can put it to him again this p.m.

P.M. But c.f. reply of Agency – not dicussg. Rpt. until 100,000 admitted.

H.M. The Agency isn’t what it was – those who believe in physical force have now got much more control. Ben Gurion is tough &amp; increasingly non-cooperative. 248

Believe Agency is torn several ways: fr. co-opn thro’ violence to insurrectionist.

If this goes on, B. forces &amp; police won’t keep their morale. Don’t like busting Agency as such. But we shd. authorise him to pick up the

leaders of the violence movement – fairly extensively. Simultaneously

adequate nos. may brk. up the organn: will show our intentn to govern.

Can’t go on protesting &amp; makg. Parly. statements.

a) wd. increase practical diffies for the authies.

Mufti – outrage tht. Farouk shd. give him asylum.

J.

S. Strong action: but associate it with these acts, not with earlier decln re

disarming both sides. Latter too big a task.

Disarming. Wd. be nice to disarm both simultaneously. But

b) Arabs are not giving trouble now thro’ violence.

J.J.L. If B. troops begin to retaliate, you’ll get a Black &amp; Tan situation.

E.Sh. Agree pick up conspirators.

But care over further proposals of C.O.S. – mght. create a worse situation. Not clear tht. all violence due to terrorists. What happens if you suppress Agency?

Might encourage extremism.

Disarmg. Jews but not Arabs will cause serious reactions, in Pal &amp; elsewhere.

P.M. Read out E.B.’s Telegram 228.

B.A. goes too far – we haven’t accepted that recommn.

Continue with discns. But disarm. Jews first: but make it clear tht. it’s part of policy to disarm Pal. &amp; Arabs will come next. Private armies are inconsistent with good Govt.

Pick up conspirators as such, not as member of Agency.

T.W. Supported that line. Wholesale disarming of Jews w’out Arabs wd. consolidate Jewish opinion.

H.D. Is it clear tht. kidnapping is by Hagana.

C.I.G.S. Both. Latest by Irgum. – their members are under death sentence.

H.D. For some say Hagana is legitimate defence force. If therefore you cd. first disarm the more extreme groups, leaving Hagana alone while Arab still armed, you wd. be in a better position.

P.M. Diffy. of separating which are which.

C.I.G.S. Not going for Agency as such. There are organns w’in it tht. control the

extremists. Want therefore to get their pp. to show this.

249

G.H. Message fr. Palestine – “all pretence tht. Agency is unconnected with Hagana is now dropped.”

P.M. Genl. views.

a. H. Comms. must be given more power to act.

No good his threatening if he can’t act.

Give him power to deal with any organns wh. he is definitely b.

convinced are responsible for this situation. No power to close

Agency as such – tho’ can raid it for informn.

c. Disarming. More diff. to do both: but if Jews only will be said

we’re backing Arabs – bad reaction fr. U.S.A.

Thus, demand surrender of all arms &amp; try to enforce it.

Need for maintaing. U.S. interest &amp; support.

N.B. Support c). Recommn 10 of Rpt. Might lighten mil. burden because wd. diminish J. insistce if Arab arms also both surrendered: might even get J. Agency support. Hagana was started as defence re. armed Arabs.

J.J.L. Diffies betwn. demanding &amp; enforcing surrender of arms.

E.Sh. Agree to a &amp; b. viz. action v. conspirators. And defer c.

Consequence of c. will be to leave arms only with bad Jews.

G.H. Proceed with a &amp; b. Plus a warning that c. will follow if terrorism continues.

P.M. Remember past Arab revolt: &amp; present threat to resist 100,000.

Can’t therefore call for surrender of arms on that basis.

C.I.G.S. The J. = illegal armies. The A. haven’t – no organisation.

Declare we are brkg. up organised illegal armies: go for Jews; Don’t need to take rifles fr. individual Arabs: but say we will prevent formation of illegal A. army. Backing for this in Ch. 10

H.M. Declare a genl. p’mme of disarming civil popn &amp; proceed by stages?

C.I.G.S. Wd. rather make the organn the test.

C.N.S. Hang this action on P.M.’s decln re organised. And indicate we are implementing this p’mme, wh. included surrender of arms. Don’t give military an impossible task.

N.B. W’out some statement tht. we are going to disarm the civil popn, we shd. be in diffy. because P.M.’s original statement on Rpt.

Ready to have it done by stages.

P.M. Say these events have proved we were right in our decln – we will prevent growth of illegal A. organisation &amp; also armed assistance fr. A. states.

A. Statement can be even-handed. But wd. like to show priorities for action startg. with the organisations wh. are causg. current trouble.

250

P.M. Agree with that. But we can’t stop at disarming Jews.

Don’t like telling U.S. Govt. in advance.

restore law &amp; order.

E.Sh. This dicn wd. involve mil. operation v. Hagana etc.

C.I.G.S. What we want to eliminate is the organisation wh. secures co-ordinated terrorism throughout the country.

P.M. Must say tht. while discns procedg. we intend to preserve law &amp; order &amp; to see that no illegal organisations are maintained or created.

Statement in Parlt.

P.M. Not in advance of action to seize conspirators.

Promise statement next week.

Get Private Notice Ques. to Sys. War p’poned.

J. ? Say – Govt. will support H. Comm. in action wh. he thinks necessary to

H.M. ? Lend a H.O. official familiar with 18B. to help Pal. Govt.

P.M. to see Leader of Opposition.

Mufti.

Drove up &amp; signed King’s book. No power to turn him out.

But Sidki is advising King tht. he can stay only if he abstains fr. any pol. activity.
