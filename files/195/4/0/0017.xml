C.M. 29 (46) 1st April, 1946 1.

Greece

E.B. Elections seem to have gone fairly well – abstentions not v. heavy.

2.

Won’t be overwhelming victory for Right. If this abstentn hadn’t been urged, left cd. have had a reasonable share in Govt.

Indonesia

E.B. Asked to keep quiet – while v. Mook is in Holland. If we use our influences

well, looks as tho’ there may be a settlement.

Agreemt. here will have steadying influence on Malaya &amp; on discns in India.

3.

I must see Ambassador. We shd. be prepared to have a mtg. with the Dutch when they come back to report. – P.M. and I, to make it clear to Dutch Govt. tht. here is settlement fr. repve advises you to accept &amp; we can’t go on giving B. mil. support.

P.M. You can promise, Amb. tht. we will have such a mtg.

Egypt. E.B. Prelim. soundings. Strong delegation (E). On reflection incline twds. Cab.

Minister is head our Delegn for this discussion vice Ambassador. As a

defence matter, I wd. like S/S. for Air. Wd. supply political, economic

etc. advisers. I wd. remain pro forma head of Delegation – but wd.

work from here.

Agreed: no early announcement.

4. South-East Asia

P.M. Will have mtg. Tuesday morning.

1.

E.B. Telegram fr. Killearn. Want early mtg. between P.M. &amp; me &amp; interested Dpts. to tackle procuremt. &amp; supply in June/July.

Conference successful – requirements firm – want phased shipping etc.,

Greece (contd)

C.E. When can I be relieved of my respons. for watchg. King/Greece &amp; prevent him from leavg. U.K.

E.B. Intend to ask him to let Regent carry on pro term.

M’while, I’ll take the risk of removing any H.O. control. He won’t go.

102

5. Malaya.

G.H. Latest informn – Sultans will attend swearing-in to-day – No boycott

therefore likely.

6.

P.Q.B. Occupying Troops.

H.M. Read draft answer.

I’m being pressed for debate on pol-sitn in Europe. Will be irresistible if W. Papers. P.M. He must confine himself to promising considn.

1.

H.D. &amp; E.B. No such W. Paper shd. be publd w’out refce to Cabinet. P.M. Supported.

Check up on alleged promises in H/Lds.

Greece (contd)

E.W. 70% poll. a peaceful way in wh. elections conducted &amp; personal triumph for E.B., who stuck to his guns v. criticism.

E.B. People in Europe are tired of disorder.

[Exit Sargent.

7.

Sarawak.

J. B. Brooke may write to Tunis. Can be awkward for us.

New constitution, if sound, cd. over. ride the wills. But not clear it is sound. Clear tht. there’ll be a bad row unless Bertram B. allowed to go out &amp; state case.

Wants to take adviser with him. Wd. abide by result, whatever it be.

We shd. avoid being accused of sharp practice.

Propose – get Bertram B. (preferably with Antonym) to go out, if he

undertakes to abide by result.

G.H. Seen Rajah, Sat. with Pam’s consent. If wish of H.M.G., he will agree to Bertram going out with Pollard. He does, however, object to Antonym.

There was diffy. when he was in Sarawak before.

This a.m. recd. from his P.S. copy of or. intimate. tht. he will resign because of agreemt. to let Bertram go. Rajah still stands by his Sat. Decor

J.J.L. Worth while to remind Brooks tht. m’while we are supplying troops for the mil. admen.

G.H. Done this – on Sat.

103

G.H. Someone of Col. Secy status.

G.H. Not subject to Parly. ratifications?

Agreed – no. Further consn.

8.

Agreed: allow Bertram to go out, as proposed.

P.M. What official have we there?

[Enter W.W.

Select Committee on Members’ Expenses. Tax-free proposals are not much ahead of current practice. M.P. now

allowed to claim up to his £600 - &amp; many are claiming £500.

b) Ques. of Ministers under £5.000. Grievance was £1.500 memo – Junior

Ministers &amp; Whips. Tho’ same expenses as ordinary Member, they

can get no income-tax relief. Support proposal of Rpt. tht. Ministers in

H/C. under £5.000 shd. have tax free expense allowance of £500. This

is simple solution &amp; in line with proposals for ordinary Members. Wd.

correct present posn under which Member loses money on become. a

whip. Cost £22.500.

H.M. In Finance Bill?

H.D. Doubt it – because it’s an expenditure.

H.D. Yes – hope this Session. Don’t retrospect it. Start from 1/4/46. Agreed.

H.D. a) Good Cttee. Ques: full-time or not – some of each, props may vary from time to time. Proposals not excessive.

Cost: £228.000. Worth paying that for efficient services by M.P.’s.

Legn required for b). – not for a).

A.G. If Conservatives agree, no diffy. in getting it thro’.

c) The “awkward Shapes”. The tax-free £500 gives them in effect another £1000. This cd. be examined at leisure. Omit it fr. this legn.

E.Sh. d) Anomaly if they get more than Cab. Ministers.

H.D. I wd. consider Cab. Ministers, who were outside t. of r. of Sell. Cttee.

e) Agreed.

f) Hesitate. Decn between Speaker &amp; C/Each. Must be clear tht. Cttee is advisory. On this basis I can accept this.

g) Glad Cttee haven’t gone in for frills.

Press unanimously in favour – save for one discordant note in D. Telegraph suggestg. postponement until after next Genl. Election.

Will sound Opposn – believe they will support.

Favour early announcemt.

104

E.Sh. But our figure will create anomalies – as betwn. London: country member.

E.W. The net of Cab. Minister is only just over £2.200. And he gets no

allowances for expenses.

H.D. On merits arguments for giving Cab. Ministers the £500 allowance.

E.Sh. I wd. prefer to allow individual claims.

This makes a dints betwn. M.P.’s and private citizen. If you allow them to

prove a claim you put them on same basis as others. Then the Cab.

Minister cd. enjoy the same privilege.

P.M. As we have to amend M/Crown Act. I wd. favour dealing with (c) if Open agreemt. can be secured. egg. M/Pensions &amp; Asst. P.M.G.

W.W. Opposn do agree. But think tax-free £500 may be argued. Might be better not to have a lump sum but to allow individuals to prove their expenses.

H.D. Administratively more inconvenient.

A.B. Financial advantage of being London member is undoubted: but can’t earn it by differential allowances.

P.M. Anomalies of high salaries.

X/ But tactics. Better to have Opposn to make that suggn: if they did, we cd. accept it.

On (d) – especially if you reject my first suggn – I wd. put in plea for expenses of Ministers when they go around the country. One is always out of pocket because of need. for entertaining. Present rates don’t even cover cost of the hotel room.

H.D. I can meet (d), administratively. If Cab. ask Ty. to see that Ministers get reasonable expenses.

A.B. Spoke v. E. Sh’s suggn.

a) Diff. for I.R. is estimate: &amp; awkward for M.P. to have to argue his claim with I.R. How can I.R. say a miner shd. live at one rate and a Tory at another.

b) Everyone is familiar with part remuneration by expenses (tax-free).

P.M. Cttee recommend it – no opposition to it. – why not accept it?

H.M. Was worried. Tory Press have welcomed it. But what will public opinion think in the end? Do nothg. for Cab. Ministers – we apptd Cttee on basis tht. they were excluded. We shdn’t volunteer extendg. their recommns. Don’t like legislators who vote taxation to enjoy exceptn from it. I wd. have preferred to see Cttee recommend £350 or £300. 105

If you adhere to the recommns, I wd. prefer to see M.P.’s claim &amp; prove their

expenses or adopt a £300 lump sum vice £500. Fear tht. country

members will show they are worse off than London and ask later for

more. Fix it at £300 &amp; there is some margin for that.

T.W. Provincial member won’t pay any income tax on £500.

Approval for x/ above.

[Enter Att. J.B.W., B.S.

Barnes

9.

E.B. Why say £1.000 of which £500 = tax-free allowance?

Why not have existg. salary of £600 and add tax-free allowance of £400?

Workers will claim similar treatment.

H.D. I’m willing to put it as salary of £500 + allowance of £500.

Accept substance &amp; Ctee of Ministers to consider presentation.

C/Exch. Home Secy. &amp; Chief Whip.

[Exit W.W.

Food: Draft White Paper

T.W. Para. 41. Wd. rob us of bargaining power with C.F.B.

B.S. Must have some facts re fats.

H.D. And has there bn a parallel induction in N.America?

B.S. Not in U.S.A.

Agreed: amend as shown in my copy.

P.M. Yes.

S. Para. 67. Too rosy a picture. They have refused to come out of R.A.F.

Approved. Publish first thing Tuesday.

[Exit: B.S., J.B.H., A.H.,

[Enter Listowel

T.W. Must we have para. 52-54?

T.W. Only 5.000 are out.

[Barnes

106

10. Re-organisation of B.B.C. Home Services.

Must be a White Paper.

11.

H.M. As in memo.

Cab. shd. be aware of possible criticisms.

Parlt. must expect some limitns as cost of keeping U.K. on Europe’s air.

A.B. Position of Wales is preserved?

H.M. Yes.

Agreed.

[Exit Listowel.

The Social Survey

H.M. Relict of Cooper’s Snooper.

M/H. have used for estimating tastes of nonservices on M/H subjects.

Closely related to economic planning.

We shd. get as much informn as we can about views of people on Social &amp;

economic ques. e.g. dietetics: factory operations

Wd. prefer to keep it &amp; develop it.

H.D. Much money being spent on this. M/F want £132.000 next year on this.

B/T. want £35.000

Consensus of user Dpt. opinion is in favour of retaining it.

Propose it be attached C.O.I.

P.M. Dangerous. C.O.I. will have diffics anyway. This is a vulnerable spot – why risk it.

Much of these enquiries cd. be done thro’ commercial agencies.

E.Sh. Why does H.M. take such a poor view of this?

Kind of thing. The £63.000 isn’t the total by any means.

If this is contd M/F and B/T. shd. be brought in to this.

Doubt if there’s much in this.

E.B. Caused much trouble during the war – among work-people.

Had to ask Cab. to stop it: &amp; I called Harrison up into Army.

Most of this informn is in possessn of Dpts. already. of. industrial health: Knowledge of Factory Dpt. That’s where I relied on getting informn during the war.

T.J. cd. get me any informn I wanted thro’ organisations of his own. I discounted there pseudo – scientific services of informn.

E.W. Valuable services.

Commercial agencies will bring you the informn they want you to have.

Postponed: H.M. to pre-digest &amp; bring it up again.
