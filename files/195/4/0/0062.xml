C.M. 83(46). 26th September, 1946.

1. Textiles for the Services. 2. Pensions etc., for Colonials Enlisted in Egypt.

R.S.C. P’pone until after mtg. Friday.

N. Agreed.

[Enter Blenkinsop.

N. Figures misleading qua principle. Specl. terms for conscripts than

volunteers – dangerous.

&amp; U.K. Forces. Princ. always bn. local standard/living.

P.M. This was arbitrary conscriptn of all B. subjects in Egypt.

volunteer fr. Malta.

N. If Maltese brght to U.K. Army he wd. have had U.K. rates.

E.B. They were in B. Forces.

N. Not in U.K. forces.

P.M. They cd. have bn. put in U.K. Forces because conscripted. Same as

B. Forces must be treated equally.

P.M. No. The terms will be fixed by country of enlistment.

Principle: enlistment in B. Forces not same as in U.K Army. Those

enlisted abroad are local Forces. Diffce between e.g. Australian

N. But shd. a Maltese so conscripted in E. shd. be better treated than

E.B. Many B.s escaping service because resident in Egypt. The Act

related to all foreign countries – not E. only. Recall mutual

arrangemt. with U.S. Everyone else was paid U.K. ratio

because brght. home to U.K. Forces. Can we now distinguish

betwn. U.K. national &amp; Maltese both conscripted in E.

E.B. Yes.

N. Didn’t serve in E. – nor in U.K. Army.

P.M. What were they in?

U.K. nationals.

R.S.C. Argument in para. 3: unfounded: no such difference.

N. Formidable consequences. For principle: troops fr. all origins if in

329

Dugd. Nos. of Maltese etc., in R.N. – paid B. rates, even tho’ living in

Malta.

H.M. Ty. apprehensive. Far-reaching consequences. Codes of pay for local

varied acc. to stand/living in country of origin. This wd. be

P.M.

G.H. Govr./Malta has said no re-action on Maltese Forces.

E.B. No precedent for E. – cd. never do this again there.

P.M. No precedent at all: because special circs. of compuls. enlistment.

Blenk. Doesn’t affect us directly. Might have some

Forces are about to be considered. Proposal = new Pay Code

undermined by this.

R.S.C. &amp; This is a complete fallacy.

v. indirect repercussions.

All in Egypt were on genl. liability.

3. T.U.C. and Extra Food for Miners.

But we don’t object to F.O. view.

de Fr. R.A.F: genl. service liability – U.K. rates.

limited .. .. local ..

F.O. proposal approved.

[Exit Blenk. De Freitas T.U.C. opposed.

available. Knowg. T.U.C. opposn to differentn, I thght it useless

T.U.C. They did.

J.S. Endorsed this history. Quoted conclns of Coal Cttee – subject to

I took parallel action by informg. Woodcock (Food Cttee of T.U.C.).

Cause of trouble. Miners officials spoke (before T.U.C. mtg) saying

[Exit J.S.

E.Sh. Extra food for miners – Cab. favourable – M/F. thght. it impract. –

Nothing therefore done.

Later at Coal Cttee 1/8 M/F. said somethg. (meat) cd. be done if meat

to go to them again. I therefore asked miners to negotiate it with

T.U.C. concurrce.

He told his Cttee.

we favoured it and T.U.C. opposed it. That was the trouble.

T.U.C. Council approved in the end, subject to censure of our tactics.

Promised other heavy workers same addl. meat in their canteens.

Took note. [Enter C.O.S.

4. Policy in Libya. 2nd Smuts – concerned at its going to U.N. When Fr. came out for

Smuts told me I was right in favouring 12 mos. delay &amp; Commn

Found that our adminn operatg. in acc. with Hague Convn – with

to complain.) Concluded we shd. take a broader interpretn of

We shd. try to get Cyrenaica.

Symp. for assocn of Abyssinia with Eritrea.

associated with it. Have tried, however, to get Cyrenaica

E.B. In a lonely posn in Paris.

1st Austr. amendmt. to add 3 who fought in Italy to 4.

restoration to Italy: with R. support: and U.S. unintelligible:

to see inhabitants.

result tht. it wasn’t as progressive as I wd. wish. Saw

Genls. Cummings &amp; Anderson. (Even Senussi were beginning

our obligns in adminn.

Tripolitania diff. Sympathy for Italy assocn.

Looks like condominium for Trip. &amp; Eritr., with Italy &amp; Arabs

separated vice dealg. with Libya as whole.

Hostility in Paris to U.K. Suggd therefore independence. Recalled

pledges to Senussi. U.S. have since discovered violence of local opposn to Fr. or Italians return.

as to give us strategic facilities.

Shd., however, remind Cab. of H.D.’s view re

Therefore proposals in my para. 13. C.O. have promised help.

C.N.S. C.O.S. in accord – esp. para. 10. – so long as Fr. document so drafted

H.M. Think F.O. right. Need such a base. overseas expenditure.

any mil. expendre. Too much for popn of ¼ m. Ty. wd. prefer

P.L. India think Libya shd. be treated as whole: &amp; 2 countries be

P.M. Give Doms. one week to comment.

E.B. Smuts agrees.

R.S.C. Para. 13 stands, whatever may happen. This wd. help us to get trade in

economic condns of inhabitants.

Support F.O. view on this, as against Ty. who take a short-term view.

x/ Ty. think strategic worth be considered first – in comp. with

Kenya plan and the Transjorden commitment.

Cost £3½ m. over last 4 years. On this plan £1 m. p.a. apart from

to stick to damage repair p’mme.

independent as early as possible.

this area.

A.B. If we have mil. bases we can’t dissociate ourselves fr. social &amp;

If we do, we have to spend more later.

331

G.H. Support F.O.

5. Postponement of Municipal Elections

Agreed. &amp; consultn with Doms.

[Exit C.O.S. N. &amp; Dugdale.

[Enter Oliver. N. Edwds.

J.W. Less diffy. in Scotland. But support memo. because risk of strike.

G.H.O. As in memo. Need to safeguard risk of strike – hence O. in C.

Legn needed at once.

H.M. All over the country: but S.O. makes contracts.

proposal.

Provn in 3rd schedule of 1933 Act. To meet that, legn shd. provide

that notice be given as soon as practicable after election.

P.M. Why not foreseen? Overtime abolished in August.

Where is printing done?

P.M. Don’t you want flexibility – need all the elections be p’poned.

Uniform delay of 5 days mightn’t meet the case in all areas.

x days.

J.W. That is what I am suggesting for Scotland.

A.B. V. diff. Parly. situation.

Any priority for this printing.

Why not empower l.a. to p’pone. for a period not exceeding

What defence – v. argument tht. our democracy can’t work in time.

Principle that elections shall be held on same day.

P.M. Why can’t it be printed?

O. Because usually done in over-time hours. No powers over printers.

T.W. No overtime rule has created a new situation.

E.B. Why weren’t contracts w’drawn to Ldn., where no elections?

{ duplicate vice print.

Think further thght. shd. be given to these possibilities.

H.M. Cdn’t we improvise – { re-distribute printing orders.

{ Order requiring priority.

{ Consult Printers Union.

Agreed: H.M. to go into this, with a view to avoiding legn.

[Exit N. Edwards.

332

6. Reciprocal Abolition of Visas.

D.p. argument. Doesn’t arise.

Tourist traffic: we are losing on balance.

Want peoples of W. Europe to mix.

E.B. Serious diffies in W. Europe. Brake on movement.

Want power to open discns – France, Holl., Belg. – then Scandinavia.

Future – hope to get ppts issued thro’ M/Labour offices.

P.M. No restriction on tourists. Decided only not to encourage.

But the restns cd. be raised now.

P.M. Visa’s – we previously thought it shd. be p’poned. Think

G.H.O. The trouble is not undesirables but visitors intending residence.

Memo. approved. F.O. to consult H.O. on

R.S.C. Cab. ruling not carried out. c.f. last sentence of H.O. memo.

negotiations cd. begin now.

R.S.C. Strict examn at ports will be far worse than visas.

Visa abolition will mean stricter control at ports.

R.S.C. Favour abolition if port control is no more strict than pre-war.

H.M. Save to the extent that Europe’s conditions are unsettled.

tourist “restrictions”.
