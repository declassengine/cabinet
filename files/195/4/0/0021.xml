C.M. 33 (46) 11th April, 1946

1. Parliament

Business for next week.

2. Major Bills for Next Session [Enter Barnes. H.M. a) Get ahead with prepns.

P.M. As in brief. Never done before.

b) Review of King’s Speech. Doesn’t necessarily commit Govt. re content of K.’s speech

Parly. time. Estimate that even this selection will fill us up. Remember this was abnormally long Session &amp; next will be unusually short. Approve in principal – and let legn Cttee review, as we go.

G.A.I. Note room for Mil. Service Bill.

H.D. Cable &amp; Wirelss Bill shd. be included in this – second half of it.

[Exit Barnes

Approved.

3. Parliamentary War Memorial

H.M. As in memo.

Agreed.

[Exit W.W.

4. Egypt. S.

E.B. Delegn shd. begin by offering to evacuate E. If we begin bargaining we may land ourselves in S. Council. If we begin with offer to go, it will be easier.

Shall I announce this in reply to P.Q. or leave it to Delegn. Will consider that.

C.O.S. are considering mil. implications. Subject to their concurrence, may I have Cab. approval for pol. advantages of these tactics.

P.M. Right psycholog. approach. Other Ministers agreed.

J.J.L. And our troops are in v. diff. position.

Have Australians expd any view? 119

A. They will now be told.

[Exit S.

5. Wages policy We have to face fact we are living in changing age – e.g. nationalised

industry: agriculture (as illustrated by next item on Agenda): full

emplt. will produce situation in wh. old bargaining factors affecting

wages have disappeared &amp; State has definite interest. We can’t be

wholly laissez-faire over this.

H.M. Demand in some quarters for nat. wages policy – but those who advocate this haven’t administrated such a policy. Other quarters: strong feeling that State shd. stand aside &amp; leave this wholly to collective bargaining.

Can’t yet take a positive Govt. line.

Memo. propose no more than develop machinery estd by M/L. in war for associatg. Govt. with genl. discussions on policy between employers and workers. Process of economic education – based on facts wh. only Govt. can know in full. Attempt made in W. Paper of 1941 – tho’ slight: tentative it had some effect.

Leading Dpt. in new body wd. be M/Labour.

Doubtful whr F.B.I. shd. be brght in – open for decision. Tho’ remember this isn’t wage fixing: &amp; “education” needn’t be w’held from F.B.I.

Re proposal for W. Paper on economic situation, minute from E.E.B. – no publn of quantified forecasts before ’47. Delay until we are sure of facts – but we cd. do much by confidentl. explanation thro’ the machinery proposed in this memo.

G.A.I. Room for considering whr old means of wage-fixing suit this period of change-over fr. capitalist system to somethg. diff. Don’t throw away the old machinery. But put something in to assist organise growth to something new.

J.C.C. estd during war – successful – kept its secrets &amp; ours. First step wd. be for me to convene new Corpn proposed – other Ministers cd. attend.

Loose talk re natl. wage policy. We ought to have means of examining these ideas, in consultn with industry. Govt. policy for wages wdn’t work unless industry co-operated.

Against incorporatg. F.B.I.

They are on B/T. Confce &amp; can find their forum there. They are commerce mainly not production. The Confedn wd. oppose their inclusion. Negotiate direct with Confedn . a)

H.M. Co-operatives?

G.A.I. We are mtg. them in May on Prodn campaign. They were excluded by Confedn &amp; F.B.I. If we take this line, co-opves will join in with employer’s organisations. Otherwise, we shd. have to create separate means of consultg. co-ops. 120

E.B. My diffy. this is called “wages policy”, but nothing said here about wages.

I object to any more machinery on wages.

Socialised industry: model shd. be machinery estd by (me for) M/Supply.

P.M. That was for one industry alone. This memo concerned with general issues.

E.B. Doctrine growing in Party tht. there shd. be one level for all wages &amp; everything above paymt. by results. I will fight that. All our progress made by “cycles”. I want repercussions.

Citrine tried for centralised machine. But Executive wdn’t let it go to Congress. The Unions won’t give up their separate powers &amp; rights.

If it’s only educational, you have it in J.C.C. But when will management of socialised industries stand? On cross-benches?

Dangers of discussion w’out powers of decision.

Thro’ war we kept wages ques. out of central body. But it discussed other problems in knowledge of what was being done on wages e.g. arbitration machinery.

No interference with separate negotiations of wages trade by trade.

Attendance at mtgs. of L.P., C/Ex., etc. when wages discussed – will lead to two sides ganging up against the Ministers. Much safer to have the two alone then they will differ inter se.

If you create large central body with wages on Agenda in any form, you give opport. for mass action on wages v. Govt.

Executive responsibility of Unions undermined by excessive recourse to arbitration.

I was compelled to avoid this by summoning conferences &amp; getting the 2 sides to agree. Signing agreemt. gave new sense of responsibility to T.U. Executives. This was the history of 1944/45.

Right course – go on with what critics says is untidy machine, but allows men to play their part in negotiations. The Joint Councils can be given economic educn – but keep wages out of it.

If a new machine, greater freedom to express opinions &amp; less atmosphere of two sides.

We have avoided inflation better than any country. Save for about 1M. men workers are well satisfied. Near a balanced budget – steady- afraid therefore of jerking somethg. new into our establd machinery. In this matter I am conservative.

H.D. On L.P. Cttee was broadly in favour of proposal. Safeguards in para. 29(a) &amp; (b).

Yet see E.B.’s point about danger of new machinery in which 2 sides cd. gang up v. Govt. Main purpose was educational – think that shd. be fostered – wd. like opportunities to talk confidentially to responsible men on both sides of industry.

This shd. not be wage fixing body: but educational. 121

Said at L.P. Cttee we must do somethg. about socialised industry. We must. Don’t know what. But this Confrce won’t be useful unless it includes somehow the important socialised industry.

P.M. Kernel: how can Govt. avoid some responsibility for level of wages in socialised industry.

E.Sh. E.B’s opinion valid for old system. But we have to consider wages in state of full employment w’out (as in war) high sense of discipline.

Un-coordinated wage structure. because movemt. in dirn of higher wages is unregulated separate series of movements.

We’ve endorsed subsidy of e/living – that is concealed subsidy of wages as a whole. Go on with that and you must have some interest in wages levels.

P.M. You subsidise more than wages.

I objected to memo. in L.P. Cttee because this was discn w’out power

to decide.

E.Sh. But it was because wages you did it.

At least it has a bearing on it.

No-one has suggd State shd. fix wages. But remember extent to wh. in fact Govt. has had to intervene in one way or another. We must go on doing so.

Face these facts.

Are we seekg. to construct a new wages policy or merely to examine problem?

I wd. prefer Govt. to go on considering what is meant by “wages policy”.

Can’t have uniform wages – must differentiate acc. to type etc. of work.

Must be careful in approaches to T.U.’s. But can’t get anywhere if we don’t talk to them – not re wages but re ques. principles &amp; views.

……………………. out of room ……………………….

P.M. We are moving into new situation – because of a) socialised industries b) full employment

This doesn’t really solve it. We must think harder. L.P. to review further.

J.J.L. Danger of increasing sense of irresponsibility.

P.M. Yes - study that effect in Australia due to arbitrations system.

L.P. to consider further in light of discussion &amp; submit further rprt.

6. Agricultural Wages.

122

G.A.I. Advance – some measure of agreemt. that graded wage system shd. be devised as long term policy.

But m’while must seek some early settlement of wages unrest in agriculture, short-term.

How can we break the deadlock?

Must get some move on the minimum. Union mistaken in askg. for £1.

Believe 70% or 75%. wd. be acceptable, to the men. Then they cd. argue differentials in the talk about grading.

Ques. is – how can we give the hint that a rise to 75% wd. be reasonable ?

New factor – would food shortage: need to increase agric. prodn.

Wd. like to tie it up with stabilisation for a period – cd. we give some indication of that also? For we want stability in prices also wages.

Repercussions on rural workers. Several recently fixed, with stabilisation provns

T.W. Too dangerous to hint to farmers tht. increase wd. be covered by price increase. Wd. interfere with independence of wages boards.

Rather than give informal hints to one side or both, I wd. prefer to make a

public statement on lines of P.Q. &amp; answer in memo.

T.W. But alternative course then suggested by M/L. was tried and failed!

Don’t like private hint or public direction. Wdn’t it be better for

M/Ag. &amp; Ty. to discuss prices &amp; put them up a bit = then say there is

fair opportunity for wages discussion. Better to do it that way round.

P.M. This wd. be direct invitation to Bd. (or independent members) to grant an increase.

Repeated previous decision of Cabinet.

A.B. If wages increased as result of Govt. hint, what does that mean as regards prices &amp; Govt. subsidy to them.

H.M. One factor is – T.U. is misleading public by concealing extent to wh. wages above minimum are being paid. M/Ag. shd. give publicity to the facts.

Agree they shd. have somethg. on the minimum – prob. 5/= or a little more.

Real problem = how to make farmers pay some part of the addition?

P.M. Trouble: average farmer can pay higher wages &amp; do: but marginal land warrants higher prices &amp; lower wages – and big farmers make a lot out of it.

T.W. But large propn of B. farms employ only 1 or 2 men.

20/30.000 invited to come from Army in Class B. - &amp; v. few are willing to come out.

E.W. a) Can’t you subsidise marginal land?

P.M. No.

E.W. b) Can’t afford further increase in prices of vegetables.

123

A.B. Satisfied a) most farmers are prosperous. b) worst black market in war.

If price increases, ought we to put a time limit on the higher price? How

shall we ever get increased efficiency otherwise? They must have a

target date by wh. they will absorb the increase in quarter efficiency.

Done this in bldg. – they say they will absorb the extra 4% p. hour in increased output.

H.D. a) Avoid any promise of any price increases. Food subsides v. high already: &amp; don’t want to push up that cost..

b) Don’t believe it’s necessary. Most farmers cd. afford the additional 5/= or 7/6. Even if problem of marginal land cdn’t be solved by Coalition, doesn’t follow that we can’t solve it.

c) Get Wages Bd. mtg. again – M/Labour say workers will apply on 23/4. Let Bd. know informally we wdn’t object to another 5/= increase or so. But no commitment at all on prices.

E. Sh. More publicity on facts – wages above minimum etc., - before Bd. meets.

Nothing here about effect on prices of a 5/= increase. What will it cost?

H.D. My point in general: at this stage of financial year &amp; this Parlt. we shd. not give any more subsidy to farmers.

T.W. Food is important: anti-farmer and ant-landowner psychology shdn’t govern Cab. decisions. Cab. must face the fact that we can’t hold labour force in agriculture w’out improving conditions.

G.A.I. Public enquiry? a) delay: but b) might disclose what profits are made: c) effect on Wages Bd. – “no confidence”: d) workers aren’t keen on it.

Don’t believe therefore it wd. give us a settlement. Might be worth havg. it afterwds.

A. Competent farmers are doing v. well: &amp; most of them pay above the minimum.

Marginal land – generally farmed by the larger farmers. They have no case.

Efficiency of B. farmers is greater than in almost any country. (save prs.

Holland).

Believe they will succeed in getting somethg. on the minimum. And

industry can bear it.

Fatal to admit that wage increases will be reflected automatically in price increases.

Concln: they are bringing up their claim: let them proceed: take no overt action meanwhile.

J. Agreed. Another 5/= won’t solve man-power problem of industry.

T.W. Govt. have accepted duty to fix prices. They were fixed in Feb. on basis of independent estimate of cost. Any subsequ. increase in cost gives farmers a right to ask for prices to be reviewed.

124

Agreed: {Let it take its course.

{don’t even try the publicity line.

7. Channel Islands: Constitutional Reform. H.M. Cttee in 1925. Consisted of D/Devonshire &amp; various Members.

C.E. Will consult with H.M. on composition.

C.E. Constitution establd by King John &amp; not changes since.

General desire in Islands for liberalising reform. Resolutions passed in States. Islands want to ensure tht. King-in-Council will approve what they propose.

Agreed.

8. India: Constitutional Discussions.

P.M. Read Tel. Index 14. Course B. wd. produce a weak defensive posn. But it wd. be better than

nothing.

H.M. Let Cab. agree – subject to P.M. securing views of C.O.S.
