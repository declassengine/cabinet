367

A.G. Autumn Session. Agree we needn’t declare intentn now. But if we are to have balanced 3rd Session, we shd. start in Oct. Evens out work betwn. H/L. and H/C. Shd. aim at this.

Wd. also even out the Cttee work.

W.W. Supported this. Will depend, however, entirely on how many Bills we get before Xmas. We are on basis of 2 Cttees a week: don’t want to increase that. Trouble = major Bills will be late. But reducg. Xmas vacation &amp; addg. a week in Aug.

P.M. Bills must be ready in Oct.

A.B. Serious to drop some of these Bills. Wd. prefer therefore to have Oct. Session this year tho’agree in principle.

a) Radio-active Substances – desired by many Dpts. Referred to alarming letter fr. R. Carling. Want leave to introduce earlier, in H/Lds: only 16 clauses.

b) R. + Valuation. I don’t press.

c) Cd. p’pone Block Grants, tho’ with gt. diffies.

d)

J.G. Dangerous if N.I. Scheme begins before Poor Law adjusted. Bodies going

out become irresponsible. L.A.’s likely to raise scales - &amp; cause gt.

diffy. when we take over, nationally. Don’t want any gap.

Press Poor Law Bill. Chaos will be unmanageable if not passed by 1.1.48. Won’t be able to resist some reform in care of children – Curtis Rpt. – cd. be handled in this Bill. We must put behind us all legn on assistance &amp; get down to prodn. A large Bill (80 clauses) but non-controversial in the main.

W.W. First order for 3rd Session – law by Feb. ’48.?

A.B. Not enough time.

H.M. I don’t agree tht. this is essential for next Session. Not uncontroversial. Trouble in Cttee. Even when passed, will take 12 mos. to introduce. Wdn’t pass until Nov. In 3rd Session cd. pass by Feb. ’48. Only a few months’ diffce.

Had to add Electricity. If you add, you must subtract.

P.M. What is state of readiness of these Bills?

Some are small – e.g. Ag. Wages. }

Three are Scottish } Not so much time in Cttee.

H.M. Radio-active Substce – hope to get fairly early.

On actual days this P’mme leaves no margin.

No room for emergencies.

P.M. Is there room for Poor Law.

A.B. Yes: if you have an autumn Session. 368

Can you resist legn on care of children.

H.M. Yes.

P.M. Not all the Ministers or the Members. We did more when Party was only

40.

E.Sh. “Working House too hard”. Our supporters will demand legn.

H.M. In June/July they were worn out. Even in 1st- Session.

A.B. Why not announce it: use it as leverage. May have to drop somethg.

Will cost Ty. much if not passed.

H.D. On priorities: I put the socialising measures first. Don’t drop anything.

A.B. Why not add it.

E.W. Curtis Rpt. needs ventiln. Don’t think that is urgent. Support Poor Law point, however.

A.G. Importce of 3rd – 5th Sessions.

H.D. Promote it to V?

A.G. If it’s a major Bill, shd. be in K’s Speech.

H.D. Needn’t be in the Speech.

H.M. O.K. So long as no claim on draftsman.

Agreed: put it last in Part V.

R. Active Substances may pass.

[Enter C.O.S.
