C.M. 87(46). 17th October, 1946.

1. Parliament.

Business for week.

2. Paris Peace Conference.

P.M. Welcomed E.B. on return fr. Paris.

E.B. Conference of polemics not Peace.

Diffy. thro’ attendce of Press at all mtgs incldg. Sub-Commns.

Prevented any tentative suggns: led to spkg. to Press vice Conference: hardened lines of division betwn. blocs.

Sympathise however with Molotov. We agreed Moscow tht.

resoln on method of reportg. by Commns to Plenary was

Returned (prematurely): seized on M. King’s idea of periodical

to accept time-table to finish by 15/10.

Attitude of Doms. Evatt tabled 75 amendmts: no consultn with us:

They complain when we do somethg. they

Diffy. goes back to D.P.M. – Evatt’s views. I decided to raise it

with Ministers on C.F.M. but Evatt had sent message to Byrnes

in advance &amp; he sprung it at C.F.M. mtg. I had to support it.

Conf. wd. be held when drafts ready. We have never got the

atmosphere right since. Followed by row in Security Council

over veto re Franco. That was transferred back to Paris –

&amp; 2 wks’ wrangle over procedure. Private mtg. of 4 = my

accepted – on the 2/3rds &amp; simple majority point.

Later, when here ill, feared Confce was getting into disrepute.

mtgs of the 4: they responded to this: agreed as to when we

were commd to support C.F.M. recommns &amp; when we cd. take

another line. Progress thro’ mtgs of Deputies.

Out of hand again when I came back to Ldn. On my return, got them

then left. don’t like – but

Russian. B. compromise incorporatg. some features of others

Believe talks betwn. Yugosl. &amp; Italy may ease posn. May have

never consult us when they differ. Must raise this at mtg. of

D.P.M. A.V.A. got them workg. Together thro’ officials – Beasley

was specially helpful.

Smuts was diff. over Ital. Colonies, wh. he wanted decided now.

Later he recognised we had bn. right in counselling delay.

Gt. problem was Trieste. With Danzig in our minds, we proposed

Govr. shd. have strong reserve powers mainly for public order.

Denounced by M. as B. colonial system. Then put in 2 more

drafts, alternatives. That ran into trouble with U.S. &amp; France.

Other drafts then threatened. Ultimately one draft &amp; one

succeeded.

to give somethg. more to Yugosl. e.g. Pola, not Gorizia.

351

Agreement betwn. Italy &amp; Austria = one of best events during

conference. So with Trieste – if Yugosl. &amp; Italy can agree on a

settlement I won’t insist on ours. Full written report on Conference is in prepn.

principle of limiting cabotage to country of origin. But believe

Will continue to seek some solution – M/F &amp; P. have good case, -

Believe the 2/3rds decisions will mostly be accepted. Some majority

Another most acute problem is Danube. Won’t be settled on M/T.

some solution may be found on other lines.

Oil – first mention of it aroused hostility of whole Conference. Oil

cos. v. unpopular. Not one U.S. delegate wd. spk. in my support.

but can’t be optimistic.

views may have some weight. Danube may get solved.

Diffy = we’ve begun with periphery &amp; G. &amp; Japan loom in b’ground.

Tactics: not replying to abuse &amp; getting on with work in

Sub-Commns – have strengthened our posn &amp; won us

compliments even fr. Russians.

Overshadowing conference is atomic bomb – how it will be used –

long-range bombers. Fear overhangs all Delegations. Statesmen

must overcome that, by devising Peace tht. will make atomic

bomb unnecessary.

P.M. Thanks to E.B. &amp; to A.V.A. for their work in Paris.

in this.

A.V.A. Serious side of R. attitude – shown thro’ contacts with staffs.

W.S.C.

E.B. F.O. staff. Sub-Commns in public. Some new entrants did v. well

E.g. C.R.A. must be a Fascist because rode in carriage with

3. Administration of Wales &amp; Monmouthshire. Mainwaring.

A.B. Can’t find in Wales any real support for this. Fear Welsh M.P.’s

disgruntlement.

Can’t we lever the Labour members out of this unwelcome

coalition.

H.D. Main T.U. offls. are sound on this. Guide some of this into Reg.

Welsh Day in H/C. – speakers?

H.M. As in memo. If approved, motion cd. be shown to-day to G. &amp;

W.W. Chair agrees tht. this formula wd. allow of debate on S of S.

have fallen into mere demagogy – helped by Grenfell’s

This is now supported by W. Mail.

Councils where T.U. more hard than at Westminster. [Exit C.E.

P.M. Remember second point – fear of economic depression.

352

H.M. A.B. shd. reply to debate. Opening speech J. Griffiths? My own

fear is tht. Welsh M.P.’s might say he has no Dpl. influence or

concern.

Alternatives: P.M. or R.S.C. (because industrial &amp; economic

issues) or H.D. (M/Govt. at official level) or

H.M. (not keen).

H.D. Key-point = fear of unemployment. Thus, stress economic side.

R.S.C. most effective contn – let him tackle it primarily fr.

economic angle &amp; get that emphasised at outset.

Agreed: { R.S.C. to open on this basis.

{ A.B. to reply.

Motion in names of P.M., H.M., R.S.C., H.D. &amp; A.B.

H.D. Points on W. Paper. Procedure for re-examination?

H.M. Ty. prepared it: &amp; we discussed at L.P. Cttee last week.

Put your points to Ty. officials referring to H.M. if required.

4. Enquiry into the Press.

H.M. Recalled previous discussion. Summarised memo.

T. of r. Amendment as noted in ms. on my copy – appd.

Membership. We excluded { members of Parlt.

{ practising journalists.

Powers. Addnl recommn: announce tht. Govt. reserve the right,

if it became necessary, to apply Trib. of Evidence Act. 1921.

Names – gave supplementary informn.

P.M. Views on main issue? devolve it on Commn. Also value m’while in exposing the

A.B. Examn of t. of r. confirms my earlier view.

Govt. are v. few. If we do nothing, we shall have to invent other

R.S.C. Still believe not right moment: no idea how we wd. handle it: wd.

like poss. action to be considered first.

J. Agreed. Danger of flop, if they find nothing.

H.D. RSC.’s argument goes too far – why appoint any R. Commn. Believe

such an enquiry wd. be useful – Commn might invent a policy.

This ought to be altered. We are too busy to invent a policy. Let us

racket.

Mistake not to go on now, after publicity given.

Time for us to go over to offensive. Newspp. have created climate

of public opinion unfavourable to us. Agencies at disposal of

means of getting offl. Govt. statements across to the public.

As State increasingly intervenes in econ. affairs - &amp; long-term plans

353

involve short-term deprivations – increasingly nec. for State to be

They are ruthless. Seen how this was done in U.S. – strike of

Best weapon = facts. We want free Press: don’t threaten it.

with the individuals I have in mind.

G.A.I. Support enquiry. Concerned re

enabled to get public ear.

E.W. Need for realism. Freedom of Press being used to create bogey wh. is

screen for handful of rich men opposed to our economic policy.

newsboys v. New Deal.

Ques: can the evidence be secured to prove monopoly control &amp; link

provincial Press, whose independence

started a new paper when monopoly bought up the old.

Mere elucidation of facts will be of value – will show Press lords are

enquiry at Somerset House. Transpt. House cd. do it as Party

Who directs Reynolds?

Do we intend exposure with no subseqn. legn? Who will face legn?

Won’t protect journalists.

we wanted when journalists were given independence.

influenced more by speeches than by newspapers.

of Reuters is worst example of monopoly.

is being undermined by monopolists. cf. Bristol re-action:

The nationals are now invading Scotland.

limiting freedom of Press.

E.B. I agreed with R.S.C. – not the time. Esp. if no legn is intended.

What is purpose? Ascertain ownership? Can be done by

propaganda.

But if State intervenes, where do you get? Trust deed of D. Herald.

Are we going in for a State newspaper?

This is a matter for the Party not Govt.

Will be misunderstood abroad.

What is purpose of R. Commn?

On experience of D. Herald, diffy. was to get Labour view presented as

Why do this? We’ve won the election w’out Press. Public was

Reuters – in Coalition Govt. I advocated getting B.B.C. to run world

agency &amp; develop that instead of sponsoring Reuters. Ownership

Enquiry may do more harm than good unless we are going to reform it.

P.M. The more you expose the evils, the more you will be pressed to

produce yr. remedy. This means a) Govt. newsp. or b) control

wh. wd. be said to limit Freedom of Press. What alternative will

R. Commn produce?

T.W. No practical remedy likely to be found.

Monopolistic tendency is however, dangerous. Wd. be advantage to

bring out the consequences of this. Wd. prefer to have it

restricted to monopoly point. – omit refce to financial structure.

354

A.V.A. Have bn. away – don’t know what N.U.J. case is. Their remedy is

thro’ T.U. methods.

Informn re ownership is available now. 15/= book by P.E.P. The Labour Party can use &amp; exploit that.

re-acted on apptg. Govts. e.g. 1924 Commn on Food Prices.

Pol. re-actions will be damaging. Apptmt of some R. Commns has

If we enquire &amp; can’t cure, it is us who will suffer.

U.S. views on our leaning to Moscow. Won’t help that to interfere

as Govt. with this.

P.L. Against. Don’t see what fresh facts you will elicit. Unwise to start

unless we have some idea what cd. be done.

known” “T.U. action by N.U.J.” “Transpt. House shd.

gone too far to w’draw.

We shd. be harmed because said to be interfering with freedom of

Enquiry wd. show Press of Left (progressive Press) is no freer.

Labour Party – feeling in favour of enquiry, esp. into monopolistic

tendencies esp. in provincial newspp.

R.S.C. Cd. we have a debate - &amp; consider our attitude in light of debate.

A.B. In Private Members’ time.

R.S.C. Cd. be on adjournment.

E.Sh. Disturbed by arguments against. “No R. Commn unless solution

do this.”

We aim at freedom of Press. There is none. What do we mean? –

that a reputable journalist shd. be free to express his opinions:

that news be objectively presented. They cd. get more of that

if facts disclosed.

On balance, I’m in favour.

A.G. Don’t like this. But impn created tht. we are going to do something.

Bad effect if we now w’draw. Victory for Press Lords. We’ve

A. Have already supported R.S.C.

Against it on merits.

Must go on with this if commd to it.

C.J. On balance, case for enquiry hasn’t bn. made out.

Press.

On balance, I’m against it.

W.W. Both sides of H.C. expect a Debate. No promise made of enquiry –

but expectn of opportunity to explore in debate.

E.B. That was old method, surely. Debate before Govt. made up mind.

H.D. Or Motion, in names of Labour back-benchers.

355

H.M. There is one on the Paper. Read it out. In B.B.C. debate I said demand for enquiry merits considn.

Govt. shd. take definite line in Debate.

The Press Lords are frightened.

A.V.A. In reply a) conduct of owners. Action whether combine or

individual wd. be the same. Moral conduct.

not Govt. matter.

We cd. let that Motion be debated. a) majority of our Party wd.

support it. b) Coalition Govt. liked to find out what H/C. felt.

That often led Govt. into trouble. - &amp; that was a Coalition Govt.

A.B. Don’t want Motion directing Govt. } General agreement with

“Draw attentn to public alarm …….” } that view.

R.S.C. Much less objn to action based on carried Motion in H/C.

H.D. Govt. spokesman can limit himself to promising considn.

H.M. Don’t like that. If we know in advance Parly. Party will support.

Govt. interests. Press depress. Prosperity campaign – no co-operation.

B’book intervention. Rigging the news.

Want it spot-lighted. Above Party. Health of the Press as a national

institution.

Intellectual level of our people is higher than Press suggests.

b) emphasise monopoly - &amp; you’ll have to say why you don’t

deal with restrictive practices generally.

c) This is pre-eminently a H/C. matter (if put on natl. level)

P.M. Have a debate. Let Govt. speak last. But Govt. spokesman then to

take a line.

Names: Small no. commandg. confidence.

This list is not impressive.

Shd. include retired men with pract. experce.
