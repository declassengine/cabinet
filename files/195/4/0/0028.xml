C.M. 40 (46) 2nd May, 1946

1. Parliament.

2.

Business for next week.

Submission of Memoranda to Cabinet. E.Sh. Protested at insufficient time for consn of memo.

P.M. Will remind about 2-day rule.

3. Iron &amp; Steel Industry.

[Enter J.W.

H.M. Shall I announce to-day?

H.M. Case for day’s debate. Govt. Motion – to secure positive role.

Terms of motion in Cl. 177 – discussed &amp; amended.

P.M. Need we give a day?

H.M. Yes: good Parly. practice.

W.W. You’ll be asked if you don’t.

W.W. Day - before end/May.

Agreed: Volunteer the statement re a day (no date).

J. Cd. we not give an early indication of line of demarcation. – betwn what we

take over &amp; what we don’t.

P.M. Discuss with M/Supply.

J.W. Will certainly be said in Debate.

Draft W. Paper – will need careful considn prob. by S/Industries Cttee. But general points here.

H.M. Either a convincing argument or none at all. If first alternative chosen, S/I. Cttee can consider &amp; bring to Cab. Week’s delay. But wd. we have any argument at all? Spoils opening speech in debate. Unless our posn on this is so weak tht. we must put out arguments at once, I incline to publishg. industry’s Rpt. w’out comment. That is technical argument: will raise issue whr. industry alone cd. do this reconstn. 158

L.P.S. Agreed.

H.M. Have not promised to do more than publish industry’s report in a W. Paper.

J.W. Wanted make it clear

a)

b)

(i)

(ii)

H.D. Also a v. bad &amp; long report as well as the good one.

[Enter: J.B.H. Barnes

many enquiries already.

Can’t be settled w’out detailed examn on ground.

c) Pose alternatives to show

priv. enterprise not respons. now: cartel.

decn on comm. &amp; econom. grds.

Disadvantage of publ. ind. rpt. alone – good rpt. makes good case, but assumes Govt. financial aid.

A.B. Unwise to be rushed into publishg. this W. Paper. It falls betwn. 2 stools.

Doesn’t make the historical case v. the industry.

Reserve our case for a speech.

P.M. Don’t leave industry’s rpt. holdg. field alone for too long before Debate.

Originally thought shd. be prefaced by short statemt. of Govt. policy.

This however won’t do. If anything put out in writing, shd. include demarcation.

Cd. S/I. Cttee look at the ques &amp; report next week to Cabinet.

E.Sh. What are the Cttee to investigate? They will be back again on ques. of severance.

P.M. S/I Cttee go on workg. out what we shall say in Debate.

M’while decide now to publish only industry’s Rpt. w’out prefacing statement of Govt. policy.

J.J.L. Public mind not so clear on steel as on coal. See that Press take the right points on the industry’s rpts.

A. Yes: get across our basic case.

H.M. Asked Lab. Party Office to consider.

[Exit J.W. &amp; W.W.

B.S., N.B.

4. Wheat Supplies for United Kingdom.

P.M. For Cab. not W.F.S. Now have the figures.

B.S. Illustrate our diffies with U.S. by reference to their allocn of our advance of 200,000 t. 159

60.000 t. for India: 10.000 t. for S. Africa: nil for Malaya or H. Kong.

Hence my recommns.

P.M. Clear tht. even on optimistic assumption, things will be tight. Must therefore

consider these proposals in para. 9.

P.M. Defeats whole object of Govt. decision.

H.M. Service Ministers shd.

150.000 t. at least allocated by C.F.B. to Japan: 250.000 t. for U.N.R.R.A. Only provn for C.F.C. areas are … for India &amp; B. Germany. Unless we make further diversions Fr. U.K. don’t see how L.F.C. needs can be met.

Para. 9 (a). Arguments against.

[ I see that Army have instructed units to buy more bread in view of redn in size of loaf.

J.J.L. Soldier is entitled to a ration of bread. Until it’s reduced, it must be honoured. I will take this ques up.

know in advance about these orders on matters of

controversy.

Also (b) on p.4.

P.M. But Cl. Anderson’s lr. is based on faith.

They shd. issue instns to ensure it]

T.W. My memo. is mainly factual. M/Food – on assumptions. Second picture takes an estimate of collections from prodn wh. I can’t accept for a moment. This is how he gets his minus.

If our discussions are to be based on assumptns, see p.3 of Hutton’s letter. He expects ample shipments after July.

Easy for M/F. to increase extrn rate: diffies come later.

N.B. I was also impressed by Hutton’s lr. Will make gt. diffies if they achieve their 6m. target. But see (c) in Hutton’s last para. – if we will do our share.

Telegr. fr. Halifax support the view tht. to get it out of U.S. we must do somethg. more - &amp; he urges do it now.

At mtgs. with Eur. Ministers countries with 90% rate told me no waste caused.

Same for Switz. for 88%.

T.W. Cl. And. pressure is for redn of U.K. stocks. But M/F. plan is for increasing stocks. Will our other plans be suff. dramatic?

A. Argument v. raising rate is, not quality of Bread, but animal food.

H.M. Psych. pt. in handling of U.S. They want to see action comparable to their 25% cut.

160

Shd. we lengthen rate until we know whr. we are gettg. the Aug/Sept. supplies.

Another point – allocn for May: sending supplies to Japan &amp; more to

Think we shd. challenge that sharply &amp; let it leak.

P.M. Always asked for something more. They forget what we’ve done already.

B.S. a) Cab. endorsed princ. of using grain for humans vice

P.M. Won’t involve that loss of animals in summer. – assumg. we can shorten again in autumn.

H.M. This is best season in wh. to cut animal feed.

L.F.C.

E.Sh. P. 7. 1st para. Cl. Anderson. On that basis, there will be grain. Is it really necessary to make this gesture.

animals.

P.M. We never promised to match their 25%.

Will this 5% more on extn rate affect U.S.?

U.S. have much more variety to rely on.

T.W. Redn 25.000 t. p. month, in animal rations. Can’t tell farmers they’ll get

more later because no guarantee.

At end /3 months the livestock won’t be alive even if more food then

available.

A. What are stocks monthly consumption of animal food?

b) Can’t go fwd. on U.S. faith.

Rationg. cdn’t start until late July. Extn cd. start at once &amp; secure economies.

c) In reply to E.Sh. don’t rely on Cl. And. lr. They’re now saying danger of drought in Arizona. Doesn’t follow we shall get it.

d) 700.000 t. in May – means 1.4m. a month in May/June to meet 6m. promise. That is physically imposs.

We are asked to match their 25%. We said, in first instance, smaller loaf &amp; beer. Now I tell you what more we must do.

B.S. V. well. Then look at it from our stock posn. We are heading straight for trouble if we don’t take these measures soon.

A.B. Is it for stocks (B.S.) or for U.S. (H.M.)?

I wd. do no more to affect U.S. psychology. We’ve done enough.

Large nos. of U.S. public realise our sacrifices already. And our action won’t influence U.S. politicians.

Against raising the rate for any long period. What wd. be effect of short raising?

Pig &amp; poultry keepers wd. at once breed less because of immediate shortage.

Recent proof: when rations reduced to 1/6th small store pigs were killed in large nos.

161

B.S. Don’t know.

A. Milk cows – won’t be affected because good grass.

Agreement:

Pigs &amp; poultry will be affected. But can we risk 2/3 months? If so, this is best time to risk it. More potatoes cd. be used for fattening pigs.

consider this on basis of U.K. stocks not U.S.

T.W. 1.8m. p. annum = our needs. 1.45m. is M/G. expectn. ie Deficit already.

B.S. 9(b) can be done easily because biscuits are on points.

P.M. Nothing in it worth having.

psychology.

G.H. Approachg. crisis in S.E.A. is further reason for conserving our stocks, in case we have to give it to our own people.

P.M. Monthly consumption of animal feed on present rations – 200,000. in summer and 260.000 in winter.

Para. 9(b) and (c).

H.D. Wd. prefer to do even more on 9(b) &amp; (c) than harm animals by para. 9(a).

Why not prohibit bread with main meals in high-class restaurants.

P.M. Because you can’t do it w’out affectg. canteens: and thus affectg. heavy worker.

B.S. Have made it offence to offer: &amp; issued warning circular.

H.D. Psychol. effect: wd. be valuable.

Balance is wrong – if you boggle at restrictg. luxuries &amp; hurt animal foods.

E.Sh. Cut the pastry – won’t they eat more bread?

P.M. Favour 25% cut under 9(c).

Agreed Paras. 9(b) and (c) at 25% each.

Extraction Rate

N.B. An advantage of raising it wd. be tht. we cd. press e.g. Sweden to come up to

90%.

Tel. 2715 fr. Halifax. Need to convince U.S. tht. we have done all we can. Steps so far taken by us won’t be enough.

P.M. Not convinced – no realisation of condns in U.K. 162

Discussion suspended.

4. Railway Rates

.

P.M. Deficits. Have we any a/c’s. I wdn’t accept rlway cos. word for this.

B. Dealing with estimates for future receipts – must be based on trends.

H.M. B/T. are concerned – unfort. moment for manufrs. Suggest putting it on

passengers.

Expendn is strictly supervised.

Surely not disputed expenses have risen by 70%. War time Govt. traffic &amp; restn of other traffic put enormous traffic on to rlways. Now redn in traffic: average loading much reduced. Road traffic coming in.

Charges increased by only 162/3rds%. Going into this early to avoid confronting Ty. with sudden large deficit at end/year. Easy to see at end/45 what was happening.

I’m doubtful re that politically.

Basic fact – rlways got thro’ on 162/3rds increase because heavy traffic

carried live cattle.

Wd. be bad to allow the deficit to pile up until natn comes in.

Ty. have done well. May be argued they shd. meet some of the knock now.

Cd. the increase by 10% vice 162/3rds%.

P.M. Based on continuance of standard revenue, wh. they didn’t earn pre-war.

H.M. But you can’t show tht. proposed increase is unjustified on econom. grds.

H.D. Clear must be some increase. Thought it shd. go mostly on passengers.

M/T. argues can’t go too far that way. Concluded part must go on

goods. Don’t want any on coal: ready to face tempy. deficit, not too

large, until we nationalise. More on coal wd. increase c/l. index.

Subject to that. I wd. accept M/T. proposals.

Dividend to stock-holders wd. be surprisingly small.

Wait a bit. Ty. has had big profit on rlway opn. Rlway Valuation Bill:

we’ve resisted l.a. claim to rate on basis of war-earnings. Ty will be

told they’ve done v. well. Stronger argument if rlway revenues now

to be increased.

Basis of compenn on natn likely to be (M/T. and I agree anyhow) agreed capital figures &amp; pay in Govt. stick with full advantage of cheaper money.

Don’t mind tempy deficit if we are going to nationalise on this basis.

A.B. Increased costs of freight for bldg. materials wd. affect housing costs – already carrying higher prices of steel, bricks etc., Housing subsidy isn’t balancing. Serious posn.

Danger of inflation. Don’t keep down Budget deficit at that risk. 163

Consequences on industry. Export indies cd. carry it, for world prices are

high.

Argument re coal, however, applies to bldg. materials.

E.Sh. Cost for coal. £48M last year. 162/3rds%. increase wd. mean 1/3

rd a ton on

coal prices.

Worse, however, in Ldn. area 2/6 for domestic coal. That = ¼ of point

c/l.

Further review by R. Rates Tribunal – who might recommend further

increase.

Hangover fr. Coaln Govt. – must soon propose increased coke prices. Tht

will raise steel by 3/= a ton. This proposal will increase it too.

We must face facts – but take them into a/c. No objn to M/T. proposals but

must tell you what it means.

B.S. Cost of all foods will be increased – at expense of food subsidies. Better subsidise rlways.

With re-adjustment for sea-borne coal it wd. be 10d average.

And increased gas &amp; electricity will involve further rise in index. May go up 2 points – then miners’ wages go up &amp; spiral starts.

Posn of N. Coal Bd. will have to face increased charges e.g. of timber. The margin of profit won’t reach expectns.

H.D. Somethg. on passenger rates.

Nothing on coal.

Impressed by arguments re bldg. materials &amp; food.

Cd. Cab. agree in princ. we must narrow deficit &amp; if poss. avoid things wh.

raise c/living figure?

P.M. Agree in principle: some fr. Ty. &amp; some fr. pass. &amp; freights.

H.D. I’m ready to face tempy deficit.

4. (resumed) Wheat for United Kingdom.

avoid raising c/l index.

C/Exch. and M/Transport to consider &amp; report to Cabinet.

B. Much too vague. £42M is minimum needed.

60.000 t. at 85% a month in milling offals.

Agreed: increase to 90% - on basis of temporary action only.

Stocks for Animal Feed. 351.000 T. cereals

M/F. Shall exhaust stocks by end/July takg. a/c of home prodn. No imports now allowed.

40.000 t. at 90% a month in consumptn stays high.

Commitments are there for next few months – coupons are out already.

Oil cake stock 100,000 t. Consumptn at present.

164

to be reviewed in Sept.
