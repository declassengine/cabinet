C.M. 91 (46) 25th October, 1946

1. Food Supplies

J.S. Warning. Deteriorations due largely to U.S. policy – more irresponsible &amp; isolationist.

Exports going to countries of their preference.

Wheat – another memo. next week. 1.8 wheat equivalent last year: 1M. to-day.

We want from U.S. 800.000 t out of their total export of ? 200m tons. Can. &amp; Arg. so uncertain we must get assurance of something fr. U.S.

Need also for agreement on rice price: &amp; means of getting it fr. Siam.

Meat &amp; bacon rations can’t be m’tained w’out U.S. help.

Unless we get U.S. help our food situation in ’47 will be worse than any year during the war.

Wheat &amp; fats: meat &amp; bacon: rice – grand remonstrance to U.S. at high

level after their elections. E.B. to head it off with Byrnes: then

conference, which I wd. have to attend.

Can’t be done by officials for only argument we have is effects on their for. policy. I might go over in mid-Nov.

P.M. I.E.F.C.?

J.S. Doing less &amp; less – and U.S. takg. no notice of it. Adopting a unilateral policy. We face a break-down in international machinery.

P.M. Situation changes so quickly. Thought our long-term contract with Canada covered us.

J.S. No: it is well below our needs. 160 m. bushels imports won’t keep us. More than our pre-war imports fr. Canada: but less than our total imports. Can. supply: can’t ship it in short-term: in summer ’47 no assurance of addl. 40m bushels for which we have asked. 4.32 in tons = 160m. bushels.

H.M. Selfish policy of U.S.A. unilateral redn of extraction rate. Extravagant use of fats, linseed oil.

R.S.C. Possible misunderstanding in State Dpt. re wheat contract with Canada – that it covers more than our pre-war total imports.

J.S. There is hostility to that contract: hence readiness to misunderstand.

Need for clearer understanding with U.S.

T.W. We suffer fr. decision not to publish figures.

We must soon tell the world the truth - &amp; shame the U.S.

P.M. Winter sowing in Europe?

J.S. Don’t know: no reason why they shdn’t continue their recovery.

370

Will it be wise to approach U.S. for sake of U.K. alone. Might court rebuff.

A.B. Supported proposal for publn of full figures. Turn the heat on that way.

Make U.S. public face the facts.

E.Sh Para. 6 – supplies to U.S. Zone of G. ? unnecessary.

Agree must approach U.S. But consider also alternative sources. E.g. more prodn in U.K.: Denmark &amp; Doms. &amp; Colonies.

T.W. Can’t produce any more in U.K. to come in before next August.

P.M. No publicity before Elections.

Face them then with world position – not U.K. alone. We cd. feed U.K. if we ignored dependencies – 1.8 m tons required for them.

E.B. Intended to approach U.S. on diff. basis.

They are big country: no central adminn like ours: food contract then has broken down. Must recognise those facts. But they are concerned (esp. thro’ War Dpt.) fr. another angle. [Have asked M/F. for statement of our requirements: what we can get fr. elsewhere.] Viz., troubles in Far East. I wd. put India’s claim on that basis – not charity – but their strategic interests. Repeated [ ]: also what is needed for India.

Put it on self-interest: no shaming them.

I will talk to Byrnes - &amp; exploit C.C.O.S. angle. Don’t go to Truman. Try to get some simple principles establed. &amp; they can be carried down to Dpts.

Alternative sources – e.g. development of mutton supplies from Iraq &amp; Arab countries.

U.S. response to me will be – what use have you made of B. Empire. E.g.

fats: we cd. have bn. self-sufficient if we had developed Africa.

J.S. I will give you a note, for talk to Arabs in U.S.

I will talk in U.S. But don’t say I’m going to raise it.

Keep Germany out of food controversy. Keep it separate. Put Germany point on basis of requirements to get the G. economy going.

Give me a brief on Can. contract: so that I can pos. bring M. King into this. Stalin spoke to Jackson re another internatl organn to carry on work of U.N.R.R.A. My belief is tht. its now balance/paymts issue. No shortage in Czech. or Poland. Maize shortage in Rumania: but R. won’t come into trade agreemt. Why shd. we pay for international charity for people who won’t come in to the economic club. I’ve therefore told N.B. to resist any such pressure for another U.N.R.R.A.

C.J. Food prodn in Colonies. Action being taken. Lack of consumer goods.

Will submit memo. on Africa.

J.S. I will give E.B. a brief for his approach to Byrnes.

a) what we want from U.S. I can give that briefly. But

b) he wants to put the overall world picture. That can’t be short.

That approach will be private &amp; personal.

371

Later an open conference with U.S. Dpts. will be required – at end

November.

Can’t b) go off?

E.B. I don’t object: only asked no publicity for my approach to Byrnes.

H.M. We must get conscience of U.S. public stirred &amp; shamed somehow. Maybe

not by offl. publn: but at least by not officially suppressing informn.

P.L. Despatch of telegrams to U.S. on

a) posting

b) general

J.S. More effective to rely on E.B.’s approach. No good makg. in advance this bite over India etc., I wd. suspend b). India separately represented in W’ton.

General agreement: do a) now: p’pone b) in favour of E.B.’s approach.

A.V.A. Publication of facts. We must keep our own people informed. The longer you delay, the heavier the pol. attack on controls, Govt. buying etc.

Must get this across. Set this v. E.B.’s desire for secrecy.

A. Can prepare &amp; w’hold until after U.S. elects. But publish then. “Why are we worse off than in war?” We must answer that.

Big effort on alternative sources.

R.S.C. But publn of facts will reflect on U.S.

E.B. Doesn’t matter if you don’t attack U.S.

J.S. Publcn of our wheat stocks?

E.Sh Is that a good start for E.B.’s approach?

E.B. Shortages in parts of U.S. because of faulty distribution.

Danger of driving U.S. back into isolation.

P.M. Statement cd. be made in Debate or Address.

J.S. to prepare &amp; submit draft to Cab. in readiness.

Agreed.

J.S. What about confce in Nov?

P.M. P’pone until we know result of E.B.’s preliminary approach.

372

Indian Food Supplies

P.L. As in memo. Warning.

J.S. We haven’t got the stuff. Trouble: not allocn but failure to ship. Nothg. therefore we can ask U.S. except can you settle your strike?

P.M. Method: best to leave invitation to Indian Delegn in supporting?

J.S. Yes: better for them &amp; us.

PL. At least can we let B. Amb. have the facts.

P.M. No objn to that.

A.B. Fundamental cause: consumption standards of native popns are rising &amp; their prodn isn’t. Grave threat to future.

[Exit Barnes &amp; Hynd

2. Palestine Conference. Byrnes willing to have frank discns with me after 10/11. Rpts in Times

24/10 tht. Goldman etc., wd. like to see me in U.S.

Failg. any development before Dec. we must then decide either

b) to surrender mandate.

E.B. Was hoping for better situation with Jews. Prospects damaged by Truman’s last statement. Better if this cd. be handled by State Dept. not White House.

Believe Anglo. U.S. experts rpt. wd. have provided a basis for transition period.

If we cd. have pursued that, we might have ended in unitary Govt.

Talks in Paris. Smuts using his influence – with Jews.

Byrnes told me, day before I left Paris, tht. Silver has asked if problem cd. be transferred to State Dpt. &amp; conversn held with me in N. York after the elections. I said tht. failing early settlement, we shd. have to surrender mandate.

Jews in other Arab Countries are v. scared for their skins. Whatever Jewish Agency may say. Have urged Arab State to restrain their peoples.

Discns with Egypt nearing an end. Has a large bearing – strategic &amp; political.

Suggest no action – save informal conversns as proposed. By me in U.S. &amp; by C.J. and P.M. in Ldn.

a) to impose some solution, even v. violence: or

c) Suggested to me that solution cd. be found by Partition giving the Arab community to Transjordan.

Arab solution will be v. popular in U.N. if it goes there. Racial state is not popular in U.N.

Have urged on U.S. tht. diffy. is made worse by their failure to admit d.p.’s to U.S. 373

Believe they are now seekg. inter Party agreement to legn to extend the quota.

If passed, that wd. help. But Brynes will then press for contribn. by B. Comm. And we’ve got no change from our Doms or Col. – save a few Poles for Canada.

Discussions have done good. Good feeling - ! Arabs.

[Exit E.W.

Release of detainees.

C.J. Agency talks re public order. Jews wanted us to talk on immigration: we had to say no concession either on size of quota or releases fr. Cyprus.

Law &amp; Order. Not for bargaining. But gesture fr. Jews wd. help. Believe there prob. will be decln re terrorism which will enable us to release detained leaders. Wd. help to rally moderate opinion.

Steps taken to review cases of Arabs now detained.

Hope Agency may be more co-operative with Palestine administration.

A.B. Not satisfied re our objections are. What will be E.B.’s goal in talking to Byr.

We as Party have declared in favour of Jewish Home.

Believe Partition is only solution. And we shall have to impose it.

Present situation is intolerable. Moderate Jews will exercise no influence unless we give them somethg. more. Arabs object to J. majority. Conflict of 2 nights.

My informn = elements in Arab world who wd. support Partition if we imposed it.

Any further discns shd. be on basis of Partition.

E.Sh. Whatever we do, we shdn’t abandon Mandate. Wd. be confession of weakness: wd. wreck our posn in M/E.

E.B. Maybe: but C.O.S. say we can’t impose solution opposed by both sides. Arab disquiet – disorder in Iraq – letting R. into Mosul oil. What about all

that?

Hope H.M. will convey my gratitude.

3. Indian Complaint v. South Africa at U.N.

Prefer to play it slow. Settlement with Egypt wd. make a big difference.

H.D. Partition is a possibility on Agenda. I believe it’s only solution.

E.B. Restraint shown by Jewish M.P.’s in F. Affairs Debate – Govt. supporters.

Can’t take P.L. negative line – amount to walking out of U.N.

R.S.C. Choice of evils.

P.M. Summarised issues in 2 memo.

374

A.V.A. Favour (b) on p.2 of E.B.’s memo. Least evil.

H.M. Fundamental ques. shd. U.N. interfere with internal matters. They wd. never

intervene in Soviet sphere of influence.

H.D. Support idea of U.N. not trying to fly before it can walk.

R.S.C. Tell India in advance what line we are going to take. See Mr Pandit.

Agree.

P.L. Stress paras. 3 &amp; 5 of my memo.

Agreed. [Exit A.B.

C.J. Indians in Kenya will arise soon. Support E.B.

A. Support E.B. If this issue is discussed, it won’t stop here.

4. Economic Co-operation with Western Europe.

E.B. P’pone until after French Elections.
