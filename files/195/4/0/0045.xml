C.M. 57 (46) 6th June, 1946

1. Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.

Treaty simplified.

Arts III – IV is a concealed long-term w’drawal – substitution of 5 yr.

period in another form. When it gets to mil. level, + we are away fr.

Cairo, pressure for speed will be less.

Glad to hear King has reverted to this idea.

Alternative: face opposn fr. united Egypt.

C.I.G.S. Don’t think this provides security we need in Egypt.

E.B. Consultns with S. New draft shd. put us in stronger posn than under Treaty of 1936. That gave us no right to go in - tho’ true we were there.

Art. 4 is key to whole Treaty. Similar language in Arab league. Wd. enable later expansion to cover dangers in whole area.

Devised to fit in with Security Council procedure.

Vital part is Evacuation Protocol. Art III of that, “placed at disposal of Eg. Forces”.

That wd. keep them in cold store for us. Believe they will accept that.

Bldgs. Under ’36 Treaty cost wd. have fallen on Egypt. Never built – because we stayed in Cairo. If we were ready to carry cost &amp; hand over to E., stores cd. remain ours – believe E. wd. accept that. That might be a good bargain for us, even financially, and wd. enable us to get what we want. But if financial oblign left with E. won’t be done. – whr. under 1936 Treaty or otherwise.

Cdn’t stay under canvas: cdn’t force E. to build.

Propose send this out &amp; ask if any need for S. to return.

Not wedded to words. Principle I want accepted. Suggd Joint Bd. system when it became clear we cdn’t get a lease of a base. Flattering to E. to follow Canadian – U.S. precedent. Sidky hasn’t yet reacted.: King is impressed &amp; wants this. Care over word “Joint” because Joint Govt. in Cromer’s day – may have to find another word. Disagreement on Bd. – cdn’t have an arbitrator. Bd. gives a regular right of consultn thro’ standing mechanism. Another reason – scene is changing: what shall we do for India if independent? : this Joint Bd. principle wd. not be a bad precedent for India – better than having left this problem vague in Egypt.

S. E.B. has covered the ground.

No doubt of unity of Eg. opinion, from King downwards.

Working Joint Board – need for latitude.

May not accept “M/East”: may ask for “neighbouring countries”.

Original offer of alternatives by S. – said Eg. wd. meet us half-way &amp; give

x/ us complete freedom of action on threat of war. We aren’t getting that.

No assurance tht. Joint Bd’s recommns wd. be accepted.

Lost our first gamble. Isn’t this another? Slippery slope.

Diff. to see what use Joint Bd. will be.

P.M. Choice: good-will instead of binding Treaty obligns. 243

C.I.G.S. Tried good will. Brought us nothing. cf. Irish Ports.

H.D. Had thought strategic issues safeguarded by this as much as now.

Sterling debt £450M – second only to India. Thought we shd. take all financial discns at once, offsetting what we are now ready to sell. Finance however is kept open by memo. Will discuss with F.O. Don’t want detail in Art IV – some addn to III wd. suffice.

Attracted by idea of bldg. installations ourselves. A.

P.4. Art. 4. Cd. you insert words going beyond advice.

Key is: do we insist on Art. 7 of earlier draft? Acc. to all advice from them,

you can’t get a new Treaty incldg. Art. 7. Ques. is: are we to fight it?

b)

Sterling balances – no need for us to be generous on finance of Treaty.

J.

Detailed points. P.7. Art III. Presupposes all wd. be removed or disposed of. But goes on “ or placed at disposal of E. Forces”. Add “or safeguarding” in 1st phrase.

For Art IV assumes B. techn. personnel will be left to look after them.

E.B. But these are the 1936 words.

P.M. If we are to stand on 1936 Treaty we must

a) evacuate Cairo &amp; Alex.

reduce nos. to those allowed.

And what about refce to L/N?

E.B. L.O.’s are considg.

My advice is you can’t get Art. 7. provision w’out taking country over: but if you go for Joint Bd. you will get better facilities than any other way.

P.M. What dates in Evacuation Protocol?

S. Beg. C.O.S. to hurry. We have 300.000 B. troops there – 20 times the authd number.

H.M. Sympathise with apprehensions of C.O.S. But I can’t judge whr. we cd. do better.

J.J.L. Not much meat in Def. Bd. Shd. get something definite.

E.B. What do we do with Australia – any agreement that they will help in war – and she is a Dominion. Is Egypt an independent country? Can you force it to give such rights.

Stand on 1936 Treaty? What powers does that give? None to take over commns. What rights do you envisage for India?

We are commd to complete w’drawal. Trouble is no assurance like Art. 7 of rights on threat or outbrk. of war. Wd. they take “In event of threat or outbk of war E. Govt. shall notify U.K. &amp; we shall come to their aid.”

244

That wd. give us some right because of acceptance of oblign. Wd. they regard that as mark of inferiority?

C.I.G.S. Wdn’t give us guarantee.

P.M. E. is in posn where, if we get into war, they are automatically involved in war. We can involve them by our actions. Doms. all in much better posn. E., tho’ indep. State, is no worse posn than a Dom. How can you defend that, nowadays, to Egypt. S.

C.I.G.S. It’s their geograph. posn which exposes them to risk in war.

Our installns in E. are there, not by virtue of 1936 Treaty, but because they asked us to build them. They can &amp; will ask us again.

Still believe x/. But they won’t have it written down in a Treaty or Protocol.

C.I.G.S. Tho’ they are independent, their interests are same as theirs.

P.M. Same argument applies to Holland &amp; Belgium. You can’t on that a/c say they must accept any Treaty that we propose.

E.B. Eg. say – we want same freedom as Holland etc.

Pity W.S.C. let cat out of bag tht. what we want is, not to protect Canal, but to secure bases for offence.

A. Atmosphere. 300,000 B. troops.

S. Includes 100,000 p.o.w.

C.I.G.S. Art. 5. – doesn’t cover precaut. stage. or peace. War only.

E.B. Art. 4. Is there anything stronger in Iraq Treaty?

C.A.S. Yes: some definite rights.

P.M. Not what we want, but we can get. Suppose No Treaty. Then get out or go to ???? Even Art. 7 of 1936 is no use w’out good will. And insist on this sort of thing or try to stand on 1936, and you sacrifice the good will.

1936 negotiated under threat of Mussolini. What sanction have we now for pressing for more?

A. Wording of Can. U.S. Agreemt. might be of some use.

E.B. Cd. we define “common task” – defending commns etc.

1936 promised revision after 10 yrs. they say “clouds of war have now

dispersed” – we have a right now to somethg. more favourable to E.

than ’36.

Cd. C.O.S. try again, in consultn with F.O.

245

P.M. Let C.O.S. and F.O. re-consider.

Also point of E.Sh. Oil installns to be handed, not to E. Govt. but to B. oil cos.

Resume 6.p.m. Friday

2. India

P.M. Read telegram fr. Cab. mission re publicn of corrce: with Azad.

Propose instead issue of statement re position of interim Govt.

I wd. say tht. is w’in instns of Mission &amp; preserves constit posn.
