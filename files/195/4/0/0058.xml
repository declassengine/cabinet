to ’49. Must find other means.

N. a) Final date. Unnecessary to announce once if we adopt age &amp;

length of captivity release basis. Want, however, to know

how long we rely on p.o.w. labour.

P.M. Shortage of man-power will appear in G. as soon as coal

E.W. T.U.’s might face realities when p.o.w. go.

M/Ag. 25% of regular labour force are now p.o.w. Redn must affect prodn.

For 1947 we’re issuing dirns &amp; therefore under oblign to provide

man power to harvest. Must have 215.000 for 1947 harvest.

2. Coal Exports from Germany.

A.G. As in memo. French thinking of reductions, but not enough.

O.S. Read Tel. 674 from E.B.

If U.S. produce the coal, French grievance will be met.

If not, we shd. still cut exports by 350.000 t. in October &amp; hope for

improvements in posn for Nov. &amp; Dec. 350.000.

S.D. Genl. posn. Shortage of coal: effects on rlways, steel, bldg. materials

(delaying housing repairs) exports (with result of continuing

B. subsidy).

Econ. distress = breeding ground for Communist agitation.

3.5 m. to w. Zones now: 2 m. to B. Zone. Leavg. 1.5 m. for export

of wh. 950.000 available for E.C.O. countries. Prodn rising

slowly but no hope of big increase w’out more steel for mining

machinery &amp; miners houses.

Cttee of experts at work for a month but can’t agree. Even when we

get rpt. will have to go to C.C. &amp; C.F.M. Must this week allocate

for Oct. &amp; shd. do so for Oct/Dec.

Suggest, as compromise, 3.8 to w. Zones for Oct. involving cut of

350.000 to E.C.O. countries.

Believe U.S. will support us in Berlin. Not sure they will go to

Even French are expectg. some cut. Want therefore authy to announce intentn to cut exports by 350.000

tons.

Agreed: Proceed as E.B. recommends.

[Exit S. Douglas.

Belcher.

3. India: Foreign Relations.

H.D. No estimate of cost. Past figures were rather high. May be £250.000

for Bushire alone. Ask that cost be considered.

P.L. £6.000 ……….. total £189.000 annual charge.

O.S. The capital expendre at Bushire is quite independent of Indian

developments.

Was in order to remove from Persia.

H.D. Hope Katmandu Mission will result in contd recruitment of Ghurkas.

O.S. If it doesn’t, it needn’t be maintd. 310

{Enter: Edwards. Exit. Sargent.

H.D. x/ Consultn with Ty. on cost &amp; phasing – Agreed.

Agreed, subject to x/.

{Re-enter: de Freitas, Tomlinson

4. Squatters.

C.E. Situation less tense.

Diffies when we come to evict those who are in.

Squatters in property actually in use – have authd l.a.’s to evict.

Hope instns given by Serv. Dpts will ensure tht. squatters find it more

diff. to get in to these properties.

A.B. Can Serv. Dpts co-operate more quickly.

Dawes Hill Camp (R.A.F.) occupied by squatters because undefended.

High Wycombe. V. diff. to get them out. Shdn’t let them get in.

de Fr. Don’t know facts – will enquire.

C.E. Serv. Dpts promised (2 weeks ago) to give at least 3 months’ notice

to M/W. so that we cd. know what we shd. do with it. Shan’t

get full effect of that for some weeks.

E.W. Bamber Bridge &amp; Lancaster – allotted to us. Are Serv. Dpt. still in

occupn – to guard them?

A.B. Propaganda – “finish the houses”.

N. Every hut in every W.O. camp has an occupant.

Problem is easing off.

G.T. We shall be able to relieve that situation.

de Fr. While we were looking for ambulance aircraft, squatters tried to move

in.

P.M. Give me report on H. Wycombe.

Let Air Miny make up minds more quickly what airfields they want.

de Fr. We have produced a p’mme to Airfields Cttee.

E.Sh. They have now taken camps earmarked for training of Irish labour for

miners.

E.W. Meeting of 20/8. No action to evict w’out consent of Ministers.

What does that mean? L.a.’s are hamstrung. Long procedure –

Regional Cttees referring to H.Q. etc.

A.B. Explained procedure. Can’t evict w’out court order.

311

D. Express would pay defendant’s costs.
