C.M. 92 (46) 29th October, 1946

1. Egypt

P.M. Talks with Sidki Pasha – leak is unfortunate for both. I cdn’t in my

statement tell the whole story. Hope this won’t impair prospects, wh.

looked good, of agreement.

2. Food: Supplies from U.S.A.

Long controversy over Sudan: overcome for years by saying no change in status quo. Now Egyptians want a decln tht. sovereignty is Egypt. On examn no doubt that juridically it is so. Can’t deny it. Only hope is to couple it with assurances about Sudanese havg. opportunity to determine own future. 3. International Control of the Ruhr.

P.M. U.S. breakg. or terminatg. food contracts with us?

J.S. Yes: known it was coming. We shall have to go into open market. Less food &amp; higher price. Foreshadowed in my last memo.

P.M. } Summarised issues put fwd. in memo.

H.McN. } R.S.C. Do we go ahead at once with appointmt of trustees?

J.B.H. Nominated Govt. of Westph. Will be consulted re trustees. Then a further agreement with elected Govt. of Land after the elections.

H.McN. We wdn’t go ahead w’out talking to Germans &amp; U.S. But cd. then proceed, reprtg. intentions to Control Council; not seek consent of Council.

J.B.H. Trustee idea. Value &amp; psych. gesture to Germans, who suspect our intentns

about leavg. indies with G. Cd. meet that by announcg. intentn to hand

over to G. people &amp; are discussing with Zonal Council means of

holding them.

Hence I prefer puttg. it to Zonal authy.

In any event, against selectg. individuals as trustees. Wd. prefer to entrust to a body incldg. T.U. repves.

H.M. A body of public persons of standing, likely to be included in G. Govt. And leave them responsible for apptg. management etc.

J.B.H. Announce to Zonal body: tell them to work out plan &amp; recommend trustees.

P.M. Memo. says nominated Govt. of the Land will appoint trustees.

J.B.H. I make my suggn because I prefer the industries to be entrusted to a central Govt. 376

P.M. That is an advisory body only. And you are jumping the issue in paras. 13-

14.

R.S.C. Raised the legal posn of ownership. Need to ensure tht. when German law

reviews on establmt of a G. Govt., previous owner can’t claim any

property in these industries.

P.M. Yes: but that is a matter for the Peace Treaty.

H.McN. We can transfer ownership now by provisional charter to be confirmed by

Peace Treaty.

R.S.C. Need for careful scrutiny of legal position.

P.M. Need for clear statement of legal position – F.O. to prepare it, in consultn

with L.O.’s, for informn of Cabinet.

P.M. Use of Zonal Adv. Council. Inadvisable. Wd. lean twds. central Govt.

R.S.C. Ownership with Trustees. Operation by Land Govt.?

H.McN. Apptmt of Trustees wd. be subject to our approval.

P.M. Trustees apptd after consultn with Land Govt.?

H.McN. U.S. pt. of view – easier for them if presented as coming from Germans

themselves.

E.Sh. Proposal in para. 15 for observers. Will this help? U.S. don’t want

socialisation. French want separation of Ruhr. Their presence wd. be

embarrassing. And how cd. we justify excludg. Russia?

Second ques. – who will determine policy? C-in-C or Trustees? And if

former, will be interfered with by Control Council?

R.S.C. C-in-C. will direct the policy, wherever the ownership lies. This is true for

all G. industries &amp; econ life in B. Zone. Why associate repves as in 15

only for these socialised industries, &amp; not for the rest.

Only Govt. now existg. is Land Govt. Shd. do it thro’ that Govt.

H.McN. Want France in because interests mainly in R. heavy indies Other W. Europ. Govts. in consequence. U.S. because a) fusion of Zones b) need for U.S. capital.

H.M. a) U.S. = capitalist. b) another grievance for Russia. Their behaviour in their Zone entitles us to take unilateral action: but once we bring in other Allies we can’t justify exclusion of Russia.

J.B.H. We have Fr. liaison officers, as observers, in Ruhr – to watch prodn &amp; allocn of coal. F.O. presumably have nothg. more in mind. 377

P.M. Para. 15 means much more than that.

A.V.A. Cd. Ty. B/T. and M/F &amp; P. consult with F.O. on this at official level.

discussion, of { c) para. 15 observes.

a) selection of Trustees. Avoidance of Nazis.

Officials to discuss points raised in discussion.

H.McN.

4. Ireland

H.McN. Para. 15 may be hangover fr. 1st scheme, which is discussed with W. Europ. Govts. Remember, too, we are asking U.S. to put up 4/5th of the capital required for the 2 Zones.

P.M. The 2nd plan isn’t international. Para. 15 is not consistent.

A.B. Danger of alienating R. for the sake of U.S. financial support. This wd. be a gratuitous affront to Russia.

P.M. Further examinn { a) legal position – L.O.’s

in light of Cabinet’s { b) apptmt of trustees &amp; degree of their control.

Discussion with officials.

A.V.A. Include considn of

b) U.S. are not re-acting strongly against socialisation.

Agreed: Endorse Recommendation 1.

E.B. to be warned Cab. feeling strongly against para. 15

[Exit J.B.H., O.S. and

Wants a point at wh. to keep his case before his friends. That’s why

(partly) he is trying, to raise Partition. Our policy shd. be to have it

alone.

C.E. No likelihood of any softening of Ulster’s attitude.

Diffies for us over Tory Protestant ascendancy in Ulster.

H.M. Gave account of his conversations with de Valera.

A. Earlier memo. advising encouragemt. of friendly relations with Eire, quietly. That policy has bn. successful. They have bn. eased into Dom. talks e.g. on economic ques. Glad when H.M. suggested this visit.

Partition. Remember de V. is in diffies (esp. in U.S.) because of action during war.

x/ If Ulster ask for conscription, we shall be in this issue because of de. V.’s likely re-action.

Endorse A’s policy. But shall soon be faced with x/.

378

A.B. Protection in Eire has created in Dublin etc., vested interest in maintaing. Partition.

On x/. agreed. Limit Bill to G.B. &amp; so inform Basil Brooke.

379
