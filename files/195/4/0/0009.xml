C.M. 21(46). 5th March, 1946.

World Food Supplies.

E.B. 1946/7 prob. deficiency = 8 m. tons. Shd. we concentrate on

N. America or shd. we spread it. On foreign pol. grds. favour

diffusion. The more we appeal to U.S. the more we appear

dependent on them. Don’t like it. Sent B.S. already. If

I went too it wdn’t be understood here or in U.S.

First therefore see what we can get from outside U.S.

Believe Australia cd. supply 4 or 4½ m. vice 3m. Saw Beasley

last night &amp; put it to him – floor for price &amp; tapering off

in 3rd year. I said Japan wd. be out of export market, India on

way to self. Govt: &amp; wd. he look at it qua future triangular trade

with India &amp; S. Africa. He was attracted &amp; promised to get on

to his Govt. at once.

India: have G/Ins. given any increased rice target? She must step

up rice production. Assumg. no monsoon failure shd. be able

to get another 1 m. next year.

Also maximise rice prodn in Siam. Preparing transport m’while.

Colonies. Not satisfd tht. everything possible is being done in Malay.

Burma cd. also do more for next year, if Govt. sets about it. Agree

must have guar. min. price there.

Brazil &amp; Argentine. Latter cd. do another 8/900.000 t. tho’ much

depends on politics.

The 8 m. deficit includes 3 m. in substitution for rice.

The measures outlined above wd. reduce addl. demand on N. Am.

to 3 m. tons, wh. wdn’t upset their balance of agriculture. Wd.

prefer to concentrate on Australia, &amp; wd. even contemplate going

higher than 4½ m. from there.

Killearn’s efforts shd. stimulate China: K. told to keep in touch with

China: Koo told we wd. receive a liaison offr. with K. if they

sent one.

Political disadvantages of my going to U.S.

P.M. How far cd. addl. rice be secured in India. The wet fertile areas

are v. crowded.

A. With irrigation much more is possible – but that won’t help next

year.

R.S.C. With a price policy you cd. do something. And Burma is best

source.

E.B. Govr/Burma looks at this more like a farmer than as war operation.

A.V.A. Do E.B.’s figures allow enough for contingencies.

E.B. N. America wd. have to be pressed to do 4 m. anyway.

61

A.B. Thought approach to U.S. was on behalf of countries other than

Commonwealth?

E.B. But no one wd. believe I went there for that purpose. Wd. be

supposed I was arguing for B. Empire.

T.W. The real point is – tho’ we meet our needs fr. Can. &amp; Austr. – we

can’t hold our posn v. demands of foreign countries in need.

That was why approach by E.B. was suggd.

P.M. x/ Consider then best method of stimulating U.S.?

E.B. Do better with others if we are helping ourselves. Do our job

first, and then invite U.S. to do theirs.

A.B. Simultaneously – otherwise not enough time.

Can we agree to E.B.’s plan: then ask U.S. what they will do.

R.S.C. Put it to them thro’ B.S. while he is there.

P.L. India &amp; Burma already pressed to increase rice acreage. In dry areas

all depends (w’out irrigation) on the weather. Can’t be sure

therefore tht. extra acreage will produce extra production.

P.M. Approach U.S. on idea of world granary. F.A.O.?

N.B. Cd. be done thro’ F.A.O., I believe. Broadley is discussg. with Orr.

R.S.C. Burma is key to rice: is D. Smith the right man for it?

P.L. Not a good administrator: we’ve had to push him.

A. He’ll never do this job.

Remember always price for primary producer. Give him a fair deal:

he’s never had it in India/Burma.

E.B. A floor for rice is essential.

T.W. cf. palm oil: higher the price, lower the output – w’out consumer

goods.

P.M. Come back to x/.

E.B. D. Acheson is only man to move in U.S. F.A.O. will lead only to

resolutions.

Let me get Halifax to talk to Acheson at once. He’s

handicapped because all countries appealg. to U.S. – “sucker”.

Don’t want to make this worse.

Let Labour Attache in W’ton to see A.F.L. &amp; C.I.O. and get

them at work.

62

G.A.I. Also Lewis.

Agreed: Start w’in B. Empire.

{ Approach U.S. as proposed.

{ Get at Canada via Macdonald – Gardiner.

{ Follow up later thro’ F.A.O.

Canada. If obdurate at this approach, go higher via M. King or visit

by A.

H.M. Not happy. Have pressed thro’out tht. B. Empire must do their

maximum.

India’s record isn’t good. No attempt to get acreage to keep

pace with popn. Want to know what they are going to do.

Burma: change Govr.

But only 4 weeks left in N. America. How push N. Am. in that

period. Can’t afford to relax pressure on N. Am. in gamble that

B. Emp. will do better.

Canada can’t be moved by telegram. If A. will go, well &amp; good.

U.S. Promises but no performance. Agree Acheson: said so: ques. is

who can move him.

Never suggd suppliant to U.S. for ourselves. What I meant was leading

foreign countries in their approach to U.S. Business not

supplication.

P.M. Politically disadvantageous to us to be assocd with France in applns of

any kind to U.S.

Prefer to put Halifax on to this.

And put A. on to Canada.

E.B. In reply to suggn, don’t mix Can. with U.S. by askg. A. to go on to

U.S.

A.B. From Parly. pt/view action vis-à-vis U.S. must be overt.

R.S.C. Thro’ Ambassador. That isn’t covert.

A.B. White Paper.

P.M. Get it out at once.

N.B. F.O. and M/F. are doing it.

Telegram to be shown to P.M.
