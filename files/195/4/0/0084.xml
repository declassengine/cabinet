.M. 105(46). 12th December, 1946.

1. Parliament. [McN., J.B.H. and W.W.

H.M. Business for next week.

2. Socialisation of Ruhr Industries. Nec. to make it apparent that appln of these principles in Ruhr is

under F.O. (who have always to think of Byrnes’

for delay – to discuss in G. powers of custodians, scope of

industries (Land or central Govt.). Don’t want to talk to Land

Also advisable to await elections in March. Want therefore to

tell Germans.

E.Sh. a) C-in-C. and E.B. don’t want to rush the apptmt of custodians.

Ruhr.

this, only courteous to tell them.

R.S.C. Para. 3 of 7012. We have

P.M. Selection of custodians by Minister wd. make too much of it –

&amp; nothing wd. follow.

A.B. Suspicion in Party that we are being dragged at U.S. heels.

being done by direct authy of Cab. – not junior Minister

susceptibilities.)

P.M. Point = had Germans to expect a lot &amp; they will be disappointed.

J.B.H. This was my view, before E.B.’s intervention. Had intended to ask

natn (Cab. decn confined to Ruhr area), ultimate fate of

Govts. for publn before all these points cleared.

explore, in G., first: &amp; submit firm proposals to Cabinet.

E.B. now endorses. Save tht. I think we shd. tell U.S. before we

Better wait &amp; evolve future pattern, incldg. wtr. natn shd. go beyond

b) Shdn’t we tell U.S. of our intentns. If we are resolved to go on with told U.S. of our intentns.

P.M. Some virtue in announcg. intentn to appoint custodians - &amp; telling U.S.

E.Sh. Can’t appoint custodians until clear what they are to do.

Don’t get a Minister involved: but do make a public announcement.

A.B. Worried by language of C-in-C. in Argus 731.

I want H.M.G. to be absolutely commd before U.S. are involved

thro’ fusion.

439

P.M. J.B.H. to go over &amp; report to us on whole ques. You shdn’t discuss

with Lauder.

others.

P.M. Two points a) announcemt. of intentn to appoint custodians.

J.B.H. Yes: that I am going there to discuss with C.C. etc. In Parlt. while

To follow H.D.’s statement on fusion: to give effect to

P.M. b) Commn to U.S.

H.D. Follow E.B.’s advice: don’t do it.

J.B.H. C-in-C. can tell them informally?

Must be report on extent of natn.

H.M. &amp; Severance. Assumed wdn’t be limited to Ruhr.

I am out there.

R.S.C. Press announcemt. wd. suffice.

McN. Let U.S. in G. have press notice in advance, as matter of courtesy. Enter C.O.S. Service Ministers.

3. Burma.

[Exit J.B.H.

P.M. Views of C.O.S?

take a risk in F/East.

w’out slowing demob.

C.A.S. One Transpt. Squadron. Cd. send 1 light bomber squadron &amp; another

No spare troops in Egypt. Divn. moving up into Pal. The rest =

C.N.S. Called on C.I.G.S for military. Naval: one cruiser.

C.I.G.S. To assist release scheme, we agreed disperse Divn. in Malaya &amp;

Forces to put down w’pread rebellion in Burma cdn’t be supplied

3 Batts. Inf. cd. go fr. Singapore to Rangoon in 3 wks. w’out

interference scheme. No more unless B. troops taken fr. India.

transport sqn. Support of troops only.

C.I.G.S. The 3 Batts. wd. mean chance in H. Kong. Prob. justifiable.

administrative troops.

This informn re Burma is fr. pol. channels. Nothg. from Genl. in

Burma, who wd. have let me know if real trouble.

P.M. We can take a chance on this.

A. Self-apptd adventurers. Don’t therefore say we contemplate giving 440

Agreed. them extensive powers. Para. 2. are we going to discuss this with

Para. 5. These people aren’t competent to discuss these issues.

H.D. Omit refce to finance in para. 3. Don’t put idea in his head.

Omit para. 5.

Agreed: C.I.G.S. to secure rpt. from Genl. in Burma.

P.L. P.Q. by Friburg re

these? Omit [ ].

We will discuss those with respons. Govt. when apptd.

P.M. We will discuss with them, incldg. wtr. they are competent.

A. Don’t say it in advance. Call their bluff.

P.L. They may call ours.

P.M. This draft gives nothing away.

H.M. Give Govt. para. 5 &amp; tell him to use it only in need.

P.M. Let C.I.G.S.

Agreed: no reference to finance. Omit [ ] fr. para. 7

Amend para. 2.

Re-draft &amp; make it much shorter.

C.N.S. Cruiser Jamaica left Rangoon this a.m. Shd. she go back. Or

enough to keep cruiser w’in 3 days’ steaming of R.

P.M. Latter is enough.

Parly. Delegn. What answer?

4. Egypt: Withdrawal of Troops.

P.M. Bad moment for that. Say not at this stage. Will be considered at

some future date. Get him to p’pone if he will.

F.W.B. 50.000 of them will go in 3 months.

McN Divn. moving to Pal. (Item 3) is new = puts difft. complexion.

P.M. Pressure for more speed.

C.I.G.S. We are up to p’mme. Shall be down to

32.000 by ¼ next.

B. troops not in evidence in Cairo

King said he was pleased with our p’ess.

H.D. Cd. I have analysis of 84.000.

P.M. I will supply it.

441

P.o.w.’s reduction 2.500 a month to June then 5.000.

if they go too fast will cost us more.

P.M. Let Ty. consider wtr. poss. we are spendg. more in guarding than we

C.I.G.S. Move p.o.w. quicker &amp; troop run down will be slower.

Enter T.C.P., Wilmot, G.T.

N.B. Share E.B.’s apprehensions. But movemt. of stores must take time –

shd. in selling stores cheap.

McN. P.o.w. – will be 12 months before they are cleared.

F.W.B. Needed on accommn for B. troops. Cheaper than local labour.

N.B. 6.000 redn in 2 recent weeks.

[Exit C.O.S. and Service Ministers

5. Town and Country Planning Bill.

S. 15 schemes between Uthwatt &amp; 1/4/44. considered &amp; rejected.

Expounded latest scheme. Discounting principle: devised by

was worth.

J. Better a bad Bill than none.

Understand case for compensg all – or none. But this picks &amp;

chooses.

good for purpose (sweetener) intended.

Dick: gets £616

H.M. He bght. it.

No precedent for differentn acc. to wtr. a man bought or inherited.

Oct. ’45 we produced a 16th.

Treasury.

P.M. Can it be defended in practice?

S. Yes: because longer ago it was bought the less developmt. value

Adopt my scheme: delete Pt. IV of Bill: give draftsman latitude to

provide for Regns &amp; alternative can be quickly drafted.

Your £400 m. will be distributed unfairly - &amp; then will do no

Tom: Para. 18 = gets £76.

J. Prs. for £500. Not a paymt. of out-of-pockets. Scheme is based on

current value.

That cdn’t be tolerated in coal, transport or electricity shares.

Cdn’t make quantum of compensn dependent on method of acquisition.

Harry: Nil because he bought in 1918. Vid. para. 2 table. On

442

what principle (land being worth the same) do you pay ½ to man

Alternative. Take a figure (arbitrary it must be) &amp; divide it fairly.

include re-development. Add £100 m. for that = £500 m. But

prospect less. Then halve it – say £250 m. Make it 400 if you

Disagree with J.

P.M. Suppose brothers: one left land, the other money to buy land.

H.M. Touche. But always will be anomalies.

bought recently &amp; paid full value has a claim for some paymt.

Any Bill will be contentious. Politically disadvantageous to defend

placate Oppn: wd. irritate Govt. supporters.

J.’s scheme concedes compn on current market value – incldg.

of such delay?

discouraged.

Re-drafting. Don’t believe scheme cd. be worked out in under 3 wks:

because this wd. be in H/L. &amp; H/C. wd. be idle.

But believe less pol. trouble with S.’s scheme. Ty. had a big

Urge Cabinet to take the risk of endorsing S. &amp; fight it through.

P.M. Wasn’t here on 1/8.

purchase or inheritance. Purchase may have bn. made by

with industry.

who bought in 1925 what you pay to man who bght. in ’39.

Must be arbitrary because float discount wd. be arbitrary.

Barlow said £400 m: &amp; that hasn’t bn. criticised. True it didn’t

then compare 1947 with 1937 – bldg. costs more, development

like: but distribute it fairly.

H.M. Long considns – in Coalition &amp; this Govt. Round &amp; round.

Tom inherited: didn’t earn it: reason for getting less.

Wdn’t do this with coal etc. But land is diff. (sinful) – from Labour

Party angle.

We start fr. basis tht. ideally no compn for unearned increment. We

concede claim for hard cases. Thus little or no compensn for man

who had held land for long &amp; hasn’t developed. Man who

our Bill because it corresponds with Coalition Plan. Wdn’t

Can’t have basis of compensn to Regns.

increment. Politically diff. for us.

5 year moratorium necessary on J.’s scheme because adminve task

of assessing share of individual owners. What consequence

M’while, complete uncertainty. Development will be

Economic stagnation.

then drafting. Believe 6-8 wks. taking a/c of Xmas. This really

means no Bill this Session. Even autumn session wdn’t help

Can’t guarantee we shall avoid diffies whichever scheme we adopt.

share in evolving this. Govt. Valuer prefers S.’s.

Worried by acceptance of view tht. compn can be related to moral act –

trustees. This is old-fashioned Liberal distrust of land as cpd.

Wd. prefer a principle – no compn: or fair shares: but not this. 443

P.L. Agree with J. Bill = indefensible. Trustees with mortgages – other

hard cases.

The 2nd is the most diff. Parly. fight. Can’t justify inequity.

merits. Differn by passage of time!

Popular investment with trustees, colleges etc. This Bill will give

E.Sh. J.’s scheme. Global figure. Mustn’t you lay down principles on wh.

it is to be distributed [&amp; ascertained?]. c.f. instns to Tribunal

T.C.P. can’t be blamed.

R.S.C. Debate – global figure: its distribution.

Also afterwds. discontent fr. discrepancy in treatment. No one will

understand reasons. Can’t defend by refce to out-of-pockets, or

Can’t treat property in land as difft. fr. other property.

them nothing: &amp; most to worst type of land speculators.

on coal.

J. c.f. Rlway rating. Evaluate tenant’s fixtures: but then apply – purely arbitrary fraction.

Here if you ascertained total you wd. have to take an arbitrary

fraction of it because of float.

E.Sh. Uncertainty of scheme. Pol. controversy over that?

R.S.C. In either case you have to begin with current value - &amp; ascertain that.

A.B. Sub-Cttee have done much work on this.

Many of us were too busy to think about this as deeply as we should. I became doubtful at end. Thght. we shd. limit ourselves in advance x/ to a total: otherwise will grow as it goes thro’ Parlt.

Agree no moral diffce betwn. land or other property. c.f. unearned increment in 2nd hand cars.

This is the Bill, of all, on which we shall have a show-down with

Have therefore principles which can be defended. And get it in early

Must pay compensn.

Can’t defend the discrimination proposed in Bill. Support J.

Global figure. Arbitrary. But you say at outset you aren’t going to

fair global figure – distribute it equitably.

Repeated x/. This is charm of J.’s scheme. One claimant if he

succeeds will be paid at expense of another.

Put in a figure: establish a Commn to work out distribution: power to

submit Order giving direction to Commn, later, regarding distribn.

H/Lds.

enough to apply Parlt. Act.

A. Confirms my view tht. natn was right remedy!

Only principle = paymt. acc. to value.

pay full value. Precedent of Mining Royalties. Ascertain a

444

H.D. Must get this Bill.

Trend of Cab. opinion is in favour of J.

figure until we know what classes are to get what propn of value.

S. But amount

Was ready to support S.

Then, let us see quickly wtr. Part IV can be drafted in time.

W.W. Shd. have bn. presented before Xmas. 2nd Rdg. 22/23 Jan.

H.M. J. said a week-end. He must do it. Submit to Cab. next Thursday.

J. I will attempt this.

S. Not merely drafting. Must think what we are about. Can’t put in a

Depart fr. my scheme: &amp; you will lose the Bill for this Session.

J. Give me latitude – to follow A.B.’s proposal.

must be settled.

H.D. It’s up to J. to save the Bill.

[Exit invitees.

6. Clothing Ration. H.M. This misery on Xmas Eve?

R.S.C. Must allocate by 1/1. Will leak out.

Deferred: Monday at 11.a.m.

R.S.C. Must announce before Xmas.
