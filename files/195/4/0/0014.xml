C.M. 26(46). 21st March, 1946.

1. Unemployment Insurance: Eire Nationals. A. a) Soldiers. 40.000 volunteers fr. Eire to Forces. Unfair to deprive

of 180 days. Then they will be entitled to no more.

S. 7/10.000 in R.A.F. Gratitude &amp; future recruitment.

outside. This means specl. exemptn in favour of Eire nationals

wh. won’t be extended to other Dom. citizens Poles etc. If they

them of benefits due in resp. of contribns.

J.G. Almost all have retd. We will ask Eire to pay as agents up to max.

H.D. Against the law for anyone not remaing. in U.K. to draw benefit

had stayed in U.K. they cd. have had it.

P.M. But these men cd. not have joined up in Eire – as other Dom. citizens

could.

J. Can’t go on paying benefit without control. Can’t say wtr. man cd.

take work.

E.Sh. How wd. it operate in practice in Eire? Cd. Eire Govt. do it? What if

consulted?

unemployment.

us w’in Eire. Favour payment.

A.B. Men from N. Ireland will get benefit. That makes anomaly worse.

my experience in war. Worked smoothly. If you get agreemt.

their benefit were higher than Eire benefit? Have Eire Govt. bn.

J.G. Proposed tht. Eire Govt. shd. pay as agents on proof to them of

Remember 7.000 of these men deserted from Eire Army.

J.J.L. 30.000 in Army: served well: came at risk to themselves: friends to

E.B. Once Eire have accepted agreemt. their adminn work it well – that was

re condns etc., the Eire Govt. wd. carry it out. Cdn’t we get Eire to accept U.K. rules, incldg. provn for transfer to

was, ran no risk &amp; made good money.

U.K. if no work there. Opportunity for bringing Eire closer

to U.K. And helping U.K. man-power. Don’t miss this chance.

Also wipe out any feeling v. the 7.000 deserters.

Provisional decision in favour of this concession to soldiers.

H.D. b) Workers. No compassionate case here – they knew what the law

If accepted that nothg. be done for them, I wd. accept concession for

90

soldiers.

A. Agree that merits are diff. tho’ techn. the same because contributors.

But if concession made re soldiers I wd. make no trouble over workers.

Wd. like Minister to be able to say, however, tht. we are ready to look

E.Sh. Can’t see how you can discriminate betwn. soldier &amp; worker.

you default?

has contributed. If they remained here, benefit or work.

man knows tht. he is entitled to benefit, he won’t necessarily

J.G. Terms proposed are not the same. Eire Govt. say a) they facilitated

forced to return to Eire.

E.B. And you cdn’t settle workers w’out bringing in N. Ireland – because of

movemt. of labour fr. N. to South &amp; vice versa.

at a reciprocal arrangement.

On principle, when you’ve forced a man to contribute, how can

Tho’ no reciprocal plan made, its diff. to deny benefit to a man who

We needed these workers as much as the 40.000 soldiers. If an Eire

remain in Eire.

A.B. Decisive argument – if you pay them benefit in Eire, you imply they

can’t be found work in U.K. But we can – all over G.B. And

these in hypothesis are mobile.

P.M. Give them title to benefit &amp; they can go home merely for holiday.

recruitment of these workers, at some risk. b) They came on

permits: &amp; if when they expire are unemployed they are

We therefore suggd we wd. pay 75% of men’s contns into Eire

Unempl. Fund on condn they paid similar amount for benefit of

these men.

A.B. Amend b) so that they can stay on – we need them. And then say you

can have benefit if you stay here.

E.B. This wd. mean another conflict with Eire – attractg. man-power away

permanently.

In a few years’ time you’d get a problem of Irish labour here.

Man-power argument is conclusive only for short-term

needs.

This can be better solved by detailed study of reciprocal plan –

bringing in Eire and N.I. administrators.

Feeling in Eire turning – chance of better feeling.

A.B. Don’t dissent from that.

P.M. Commend discns at adminve level with Eire and N.I.

Take care of long-term problems as well as immed.

91

short-term shortage.

C.E. H.O. and M/L. shd. be associated with these discns.

H.D. W’draw opposn to soldiers on basis no commitment re workers.

2. Parliament.

Business for next week.

3. The Nelson Pension.

H.D. Has caused comment for some time – only one left. P.Q. by

W. Harris – reply as in memo. Ty. Solr. has taken it up with

Ld. Nelson’s solrs. Ld. Nelson has no direct issue – going

further still out of direct line. The brother (86) has children.

Wrong tht. it shd. now go to them.

But sentiments also. Mustn’t be too clumsy. Quid pro quo cd. be

offered for termination of pension after the old brother. There is an estate called Traf. House: no artistic merit, poor repair

&amp; mortgaged. But he is prevented by settlement fr. disposing

of it. We cd. free Traf. Estate so tht. the brother’s children cd.

sell it. Wd. mean hybrid Bill. Don’t ask for it early. Can I have

authy to get it drafted when opportunity offers.

In reply to P.M., this is sole surviving case of perm. pension payable fr. Exchequer.

I wd. like Ty. Solr. to indicate to the solrs. tht. this is how C/E. views

it.

Agreed.

4. Heathrow Airport. l.a.’s &amp; others have bn. told wht. scheme involves: &amp; factories

on fringe who want to do extensions.

Wd. be made clear tht. it’s subject of course to Parlt.

A. Decided Heathrow land powers shd. be taken in C. A. Bill. But

Suggest therefore clear statemt. of Govt. plan so tht. all affected may know where they stand.
