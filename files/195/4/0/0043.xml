C.M. 55(46). 5th June, 1946.

India: Constitutional Problem.

P.M. Have to face awkward situation.

Policy of suppression is hopeless. But while Viceroy turns tht. down,

x/ he says (p.3) law &amp; order must be maintained – inconsistency.

Moslem Provinces &amp; maintain central Govt. What happens to

Final recommn by Mission – in last resort, abandon Hindustan, defend

commns &amp; Indian Army. Wants some working out.

Will Auchinleck give us a picture re law &amp; order &amp; safety of

B. Europeans.

W’drawal fr. Hindustan. Success wd. turn on attitude of Congress.

Auch. x/ only means during our responsibility – sporadic outbrks.

If they agreed it cd. be spread over period e.g. 3yrs. qua Army.

If they were not co-operative, it wd. become opn of war: imposs.

to say militarily how we shd. do it. We have planned for colln

to centres of B. Europeans, Anglo-Indians &amp; some Indians

requiring protn: &amp; eventually to evacuate fr. ports to U.K. or to

Pakistan.

Some anti-European disturbances anyhow, even if Congress

co-operative; wh. will involve colln of Europeans in “Keeps”.

Plans tried out on paper.

H.M. Mutiny?

Moslems. Incalculable.

in Army. They are integrated w’in Army – few separate units.

P.M. Commns?

to be extricated.

That’s why plans provide for holding key airports – evacn by air

E.Sh. Suppose you decided not

A. I. Army wdn’t mutiny as a whole because compact of Hindus &amp;

If Congress cut right away, wd. be unwise to count on Hindu element

A. If Congress hostile, they wd. be paralysed. Choice: fight it out or wait

But this wdn’t happen at once or universally throughout India.

to ports.

B. troops cdn’t control munition dumps or factories.

to evacuate?

A. That = Viceroy’s course of suppression.

leaders

Wd. influence Army: but cdn’t rely on Hindu element if Congress were hostile.

P.M. N.W. Frontier held wholly by Indian troops. Trouble there? 230

A. Yes: always is on Frontier if chance offers. Tribes wd. take

opportunity. Unless they felt they wdn’t trouble Moslem Govt.

of Pakistan. Hindu element wd. demand return to Hindustan.

Wd. mean troops on frontier wd. be inefficient for some time.

bn. rejected.

say 5 yrs. They wd. also expect Hindustan to invite foreign

C.I.G.S. V. little time. Need for careful study.

P.M. What troops in Bengal.

A. 4-5 B. batts. &amp; some Indian. Large nos. w’in reach at Ranchi.

E.W. Do Congress think they’ve got us on the run? If we said, we’ve made

a fair offer and now you’ve refused, we are going to hold on to

keep order – wd. the Army remain loyal.

E.B. W’out word “repression”, suppose we maintained Govt.

A. My personal opinion 90% of popn don’t want disorder – peaceful

evolution. They wd. favour Mission’s scheme. Believe leaders

are beginning to take note of that public opinion. Struggle in

Congress betwn. Left &amp; Right: if Right won, you wd. get

settlement at once.

E.B. Has our offer bn. put over to the villages etc.

A. Largely not. Govt. propaganda is suspect: v. diff. to put it across &amp;

be believed. Suspicion is so great. Tho’ mass of people are not

anti-British, they are uneducated &amp; impressionable

Add. To what extent is Congress Left potent?

A. None in Army. But it can apply the match - &amp; wd. spread to Army.

H.M. Wd. it be practicable to fix a date – para. 9.

A. V. diff. militarily – almost impracticable.

Only practical way is to get agreement – by stages. Hope para. 9 has

P.M. W’drawal of all European administrators. Cd. rlways. e.g. be run so?

A. Yes – tho’ with loss of efficiency.

J. Wd. Moslems welcome us in Pakistan?

A. Probably yes because frightened of Hindustan, who wd. attack in

aid. Cab. Mission have reason to believe we wd. be welcomed.

Effect outside – on Indian troops in Burma, N.E.I. and Malaya.

Can’t give a snap answer.

231

P.M. Told crisis may arise in next few days.

cd. deter them now. Wd. have an irritant rather than

Might help to restore situation when trouble had broken out.

Haven’t available enough B. troops to put down general rising.

C.I.G.S. 2 Brigades in Malay &amp; 1 in Palestine. Beyond that, only at cost of

Afghanistan.

What steps are you taking to educate I. Army re

J. But we don’t intend to w’draw on first sign of trouble. And C.O.S.

must have time to study.

E.Sh. Suppose we cd. bring early &amp; adequate reinforcements of B. troops.

What effect on Congress?

A. Wd. increase their determination to seize power. Don’t believe you

sedative effect.

Wd. need 4-5 Divns.

Palestine, Greece etc.

H.M. RAF?

A. Reconnaissance &amp; in last resort attack. But no use for protectg.

lives &amp; property.

C.I.G.S. Indicns of slight increased concentns of Sov. troops north of

E.B. And agents moving down via Persia. Mission’s offer.

influence.

E.B. Soviet intervention: what effect on Hindu mind?

A. Or people like Nehru – wd. frighten them, I think.

P.M. With disorder, will you get famine?

Agreed: C.O.S. to appreciate military implicns of alternative

A. V. active steps. Army = only non-communal organn in India. It’s

holding now: can’t say how long it wd. against strong political

A. Yes: &amp; one will re-act on other.

courses, and effects on mil. commitments elsewhere.

And report to further meeting.

[Exeunt C.O.S. &amp; Auchinleck.

P.M. Alternative 1. Not feasible – either fr. what can be done in India, or

commitments elsewhere or internationally. Is that agreed?

E.W. Diff. to retain loyalty to a Govt. which has shown it’s going out.

We’ve done everything wh. as a Party we have promised. Worst

232

situation wd. be to get out in circs. suggesting we’re being

stoned out. Then we have lost face in East as a whole. Wd. U.K.

stand that. Are we sure tht. we oughtn’t to say – done all we can,

not going out, going to keep order. If strong enough measures

were taken (incldg. arrest of Ghandi etc.) might hold the position.

And cd. defend this even to U.N.O.

E.Sh. Inclined to support that line. Don’t put alternative 1 as “repression.”

danger of exaggerating certain aspects. Congress may be

criticise our “imperialism”, but if we leave India, Egypt,

Time to reconsider our posn. Labour Party policy framed in other days.

what it was.

What are alternatives –

A.H. Before considering c) or scuttle: cd. we not make an offer to

legislatures. Act of 1935 contemplated Fed. Legislature elected

The Fed. Leg. wd. nominate an Executive Govt. All as interim

P.M. That wd. dodge whole issue – who is going to govern at Centre,

Not what we want, but what we have, to do. Are we not in

formidable only because it can create discord. Is it capable of

presentg. powerful force v. Govt. Must we assume tht., on

rejection of final offer, we must scuttle.

Apprehensive of effect on our international posn of “scuttle”.

Esp. since return fr. Germany. Good reasons for leaving Egypt,

but what effect psychologically in world opinion. U.S. may

Mediterranean we’ll get no appreciation only regarded as weak.

Stand by the offer: say we’re not going to leave until there is a

solution. Then, I agree: we must know what forces we can

command to do so.

P.M. Viceroy is seeking middle course between repression &amp; scuttle.

Face facts: Indian Army not reliable: I.C.S. only 500: India not

My posn is: no use adopting policy of locking up the leaders w’out

a hope of future.

a) UNO. not recommended

b) para. 9. .. .. .. save by R.S.C.

c) third course proposed by Mission: not clear &amp; needs

much thought. Fear it concedes Jinnah’s

claim to Pakistan.

legislate establishg. Dom. status based on Provincial

from 11 Provincial. Cdn’t we propose that now, by short Bill.

arrangemt., pending further search for final solution.

* Later: Agreed A.H. to submit memo. on this.

Hindu or Moslem?

A.H. That wd. arise under present scheme. We are now prepd for Council

with Hindus &amp; non-League Moslems.

233

P.M. Read letter from P.L. Diffy in end will be over powers of interim Govt.

E.B. Asked for answers to hypothetical ques. Diff. to reach decisions

Indians like things in black &amp; white. We can’t change the law: but we can act by “convention” – as when Colonies were

developing into Doms. Trouble is, the more Hindus ask for

the more the Moslems object.

on

Mission will come home if brkdown. They want only a genl. expn

independence.

then massacre etc.

Then what answer to “the runaway Labour Govt.”

E.W. Might consider also (or even) possibility of splitting Congress.

Need for 200.000 almost at once: &amp; if widespread trouble further

that basis. Can’t believe India will break into violence at once, given temper of the discussions. Leaders aren’t so mad as that.

Surely they won’t want to take over in civil war, with

disrupted Army etc.

Mission spk. of coming home. If brkdown, cd. we not wait until

they returned for consultn. Is it so intense tht. such a delay cd. not be accepted.

P.M. Their reasons are in para. 23.

It arose suddenly on failure of Cripps offer.

E.B. But what we are really asked to accept is Pakistan. And no Govt. has favoured that. And its implications need study.

P.M. Not askg. for final decision – now or next time.

of view.

H.M. More I listen, more I sympathise with E.Sh. and E.W.

What wd. Soviet do? a) Propaganda offensive b) military force. We aren’t doing either. We shd. show some stamina. We’re doing nothing to convince India tht. we’re trying to hand them

We shd. do propaganda. Mission shd. do some firm talking

Supposing situation deteriorates because they think we’ve no guts –

Make it clear tht. one thing we can’t do is to let India drift into trouble

&amp; chaos.

J.J.L. One early need: make it clear we’re not coming out w’out a

settlement. We shd. then earn contempt of Moslems, no thanks from Hindus, &amp; violence to Europeans. Wd. have steadying

effect in India.

Frame of mind of Mission may become known in India.

C.E. But if we take that line, we must find B. re-inforcements.

V. distant: wd. have to be moved by sea. What implications?

re-inforcements.

234

Where cd. we get shipping? Doubt if Australia &amp; N.Z. wd. help on this.

Agree must await C.O.S. apprecn.

in wh. B. troops are involved in lengthy operations.

P.M. Not only troops. In districts of 3-4 m. only 3 British. The Br. machine

their loyalty will no longer be to us.

India with few I.C.S. British – neither one thing nor the other.

Need C.O.S. appreciation: then a quick decision before situation

worsens.

But, if we can do it, I’m in favour of E.Sh. view.

H.D. Beware of words – repression, scuttle.

But economically, financially, militarily etc., we can’t afford situation

Don’t be heroic. Believe we must seek a means of disengaging

ourselves fr. India.

has bn. w’drawn – progressively over the years. Indians have

looked increasingly to others than B. for future rewards etc.

Unless you make it clear now tht. we are going to stay for ever,

B. machine is tired, weak &amp; dispirited. Wd. have to re-create it.

E.B. At Moscow, when I was contendg. for sep. repn of India at Peace

Confce, Stalin said risk of separatist movemt. in India. Can’t run

Byrnes, on other hand, is concerned re defence of N.W. India. I said hoped India wd. remain in Commonwealth – then

arrangemts. for mutual defence.

{ a) What is min. force nec. to maint. law &amp; order &amp; show Br.

{ C.O.S.

This morning’s discn shows L.S.A. was right as against W.S.C. during the war.

Wd. like studies by C.O.S. on definite t. of r.

capable of governing during int. period pendg.

{ Put that first: for if civil war broke out it wd. go to U.N.O.

{ handing-over.

{ b) F.O.&amp; I.O. What condns wd. make it possible under Charter for { U.N.O. to step in.

{ c) Hindustan: Pakistan. Wd. it be workable: what steps to

Might be useful to ventilate, to world opinion, by Parly Debate.

Shd. I, at this stage, inform U.S. in confidence? Believe the East is

{ On this ground, I fear the announcemts in telegram.

{ give effect to it.

{ d) What action to hold posn for a month or so while Cab.

{ considers whole problem.

the real danger of war: it’s there tht. conflict betwn. U.S. &amp;

Soviet is most dangerous.

Korea: N. Manchuria: deadlock in Japan.

May I tell Harriman, for commn to Byrnes via secret channel. Now or after next mtg? Intended anyhow to tell him of Soviet concentns nr. Afghanistan. This is the biggest issue we have ever had to face.

235

P.M. Don’t speak to Harriman until we know Mission have failed to

bring it off. 236
