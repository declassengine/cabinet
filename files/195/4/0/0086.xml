C.M. 107(46). 19th December, 1946.

1. Parliament. [Enter W.W.

H.M. Business for next week.

2. Burma. Are we ready to stand firm. Advised, if they don’t come here for

wh. we can govern only by troops. Bulk of troops in Burma are

adminve troops. Despatch of a second B. Brigade wd. involve

two key points. Might in end have to face re-conquest of

Burma: 2 Divns: cdn’t be found w’out weakening ourselves

Aung San’s draft statement. Burma for Burmans – no repn for

Strength of their posn for rebellion, short-term, because of need of

or Chinese infiltration.

(C.M. 106(46)).

A.V.A. Govr’s conversations with Aung San etc., have undermined our

P.M. Outlined situation of Burma in reln to Asia and India.

discns, there will be breakdown of Govt. &amp; strikes - &amp; situation in

Indian – whom we cdn’t use. B. troops: 2.000 in all, w’out

either w’drawal fr. India or retarding demobn.

Cdn’t hold all Burma: cdn’t do more than Rangoon &amp; one or

elsewhere.

Europeans, posn of Indians not clear. Also claim theirs shd.

be recognised as constitutional Govt. – can’t do that entirely until

law amended.

Summed up alternatives.

Govr. believes Aung San etc., wd. wish to remain in Commonwealth.

They need our help, financial &amp; other, in reconstn.

their rice in S.E.A.

Long-term they can’t defend themselves v. Indian imperialism

C.I.G.S. &amp; C.A.S. confirm can’t fight w’out adminve troops.

G.O.C. Burma has sent appreciation &amp; agrees with Govr.

earlier decision to give no assurances in advance.

Parallel statement to India.

R.S.C. Statement of 1931 re Burma: prospects of Burma will not be prejudiced by its separation from India. This gives a claim

J.S. Burma is vital for food, at present. Can’t face rebellion, which wd.

next year. That, with Siam, wd. affect whole world situation in

to parallel advance.

cut off food supplies. Expect 1½ m. tons of rice from Burma

food – since rice re-acts on cereals.

452

A.B. We have declared tht. Burma shall achieve self-govt. pari passer

with India. Aren’t going back on that. Want therefore to find

means of dignified w’drawal. Aung San is friendly to us: &amp; all

he wants is re-declaration of earlier pledges. Possibly in less

Alternative: offend Aung San &amp; drive Burma further Left: &amp; make

it more diff. for us to make dignified w’drawal.

General agreement with this view.

3. India: Compensation for S. of S. Services.

equivocal terms: natural, with view to strengthening his posn.

But if he is friendly, why not strengthen him?

R.S.C. Difficult difference: they are not repve Govt. as are India &amp; want to be recognised as national Govt.

C.J. Endorse P,M,’s views.

Assume this is Burma proper &amp; doesn’t cover Shan States.

Repercussions in Ceylon. Shall have to submit memo. on this.

P.M. Ceylon, like India, has 2 communities.

{ Statement in H/C. Friday.

Agreed. { Inform Opposition in advance.

{ Draft to be settled by P.M. with S of S., R.S.C. &amp; others on I. &amp; B. Cttee.

Consultation with Opposition.

H.D. Inform: don’t consult.

A.B. Any consultn or talk: may do more harm with Govt. back-benchers. Never bn. done until recently.

P.M. No: on defence especially, precedents going far back. Give chance to warn them that saying this or that will affect national interests. Give chance for responsible reply.

4. Town and Country Planning Bill.

P.M. Sending out Henderson &amp; officials to discuss.

Not matter for public statement.

[Enter G.T. and L.S. Also scheme, when it comes, must be approved &amp; rejected as a whole.

J. Re-drafted. This is agreed with Dpts.

This involves delay because before scheme can be laid all

valuations must be obtained first.

P.M. Postpones our headaches. Cl. 51 is v. vague …. such, such, such.

This will be point of criticism.

453

H.M. That is inherent in the scheme, as I said last time.

We are taking blank cheque – on principles, method, machinery etc.

A.B. Parlt. hasn’t interested itself in distribn of £66 m. to doctors.

P.M. Not a parallel because B.M.A. (not Govt. as here) divides the global

(prs. £25 m.) b) payment of interest at 2½% from appointed day

c) land dead ripe on introdn of Bill – remove fr. compn field if

developed w’in 5 years.

Payment (mainly) by Ty. stock.

P.M. Shd. it be called “compensation”?

R.S.C. “Payment” wd. be better. Agreed

Consider wtr. because this is money the aff. resoln shd. be H/C. only.

J. Agreed: no objn.

R.S.C. But H/Lds. delay over these Regns wd. only p’pone payment for what

has bn. taken already. Why therefore antagonise them by

removg. this fr. their jurisdn?

sum.

H.D. Global sum. Consulted T.C.P. Can’t arrive at a figure on detailed

calculn. “Think of a number.” We jointly recommend £300 m.

in Bill: but, in addn, a) special paymts. in w. damage cases

substitute “payment” in Bill.

H.M. Made the golf club point. Why shd. they be paid?

R.S.C. Might be taken for bldg.

As now drawn, cd. be argued it must be cash.

J. Covered by Cl. 56(1).

H.M. Valuer must be asked if he cd. do it in the time.

£300 m. If to be paid in Stock, shdn’t it be so declared in Cl. 52.

L.S. Case rests on claim that this is ex gratia payment – not compensation. Believe it can be defended.

H.M. Time limit w’in which payment must be settled? [Enter A.G.

R.S.C. Interim payments cd. be provided for.

H.D. Favoured 5 year limit.

R.S.C. Can say “not for 5 years”: can’t say “not more than 5 years”.

H.D. That was my point.

454

H.M. Not mine.

J. “Payments shall be due 5 years after apptd day.” }

If you can’t do it, then amending legn. } Agreed. Agreed: subject to points noted above.

land. Was deleted at request of M/H. Will be pressed in Cttee.

Warning accepted – w’out commitment.

Enter B. and J.G.

L.S. Co. Councils as planning authies shd. have power in last resort to buy

Want leave to re-open in Cabinet or Cttee.

[Exit G.T. and L.S.

5. Electricity Bill.

P.M. (i) Wales. Must get load right – balance urban &amp; rural areas.

Technical: systems must be linked &amp; transmn lines must run thro’

undesirable to pass thro’ mid-Wales to link N. &amp; S. Wales.

Follows earlier Rpts.

T.W. Don’t divide urban &amp; rural so as to rob rural of cheap electricity –

A.B. No need for technical mutilation of current. What we are discussing

J.G. a) Is there a good enough technical reason for departing from general

principle wh. we have commended of adminve devolution to

Wales.

b) This is unusual division of Wales – not n. and south.

E.Sh. Serves interest of people of N. Wales.

In S. Wales congestion – heavy load. Also in N. Wales. But in

centre a light load.

areas where some potential use of electricity. Wd. be

merely on sentimental nationalist grounds.

is adminve unit.

c.f. hospitals: Welsh Area tho’ hpl. is natural outlet for N. Wales.

county etc.

Agreed: stet subject to reconsidering Cardigan.

E.Sh. Concession here wd. revive l.a. claim to separate admn for each

Effect of change wd. be to increase charges in Wales.

Wales as an entity for electricity is obviously wrong - &amp;

administratively unworkable.

H.M. Wales as an entity wd. suffer on load factor.

Health Bill not fatal analogy. The Advisory Cttee is linked to the Bd.

&amp; you wd. have Cttee related to several Bds.

Cd. E.Sh. consider wtr. it is necessary to split Cardigan?

455

(ii) Area Boards: Composition.

E.Sh. Explained the compromise.

H.M. I wd. have preferred fewer full-time members.

But won’t disturb the compromise.

E.Sh. undertook to consider.

J. (iii) Appeal.

Amendment of Cl. 3(3).

Amendment of Cl. 27(3). Approved.

R.S.C. Cl. 1(6)(c). Why?

E.Sh. Considered in Cttee. Thght. Coal Bd. might sell coal to Bd. at lower

rate. “Undue” shd. be safeguard.

R.S.C. May produce excessive rigidity. May prejudice economic planning. May be desirable e.g. in developmt. areas.

“undue preference” has special meaning from Rlway Rates Tribunal.

E.Sh. Trouble over this ques. on Coal Bill – incldg. fr. Govt. supporters.

H.D. Omit now: if pressed in Cttee we can consider what words to insert.

J. Say “unjustified” vice “undue”?

R.S.C. Leave it in &amp; insert proviso safeguarding planning.

Agreed: E.Sh. to consider.

E.Sh. Clause 21. Electricity in relief of rates: or surpluses ploughed back

to reduce rates of electricity. Second complain they shd. not

suffer by comparison with first.

Cttee struck it out.

Shall have trouble in H/C. Want some latitude.

Transport Bill doesn’t provide for it. But can’t be bound to apply

same provns if circs. differ.

Latitude: prs. £½ m. total in extra compn.

P.M. Strong objn to compensatg. first vice second.

B. Another point: if you provide here for capital paymts I may have to do

so in Transport Bill.

E.Sh. Clause 42. Mtgs. with organns in industry (many, even in workers’ side). Workers have raised ques. of consultn with workers.

In Coal Bill we’ve provided it at all levels; &amp; used “consultn.”

Here, followg. Transport Bill, we’ve said “discussion”.

Wd. like to use “consultn”.

456

B. What I’ve done is to distinguish language for a. welfare and b. wages.

Agreed – “consultn” in both Bills.

H.D. Will E.Sh. look at provn requiring dissoln of cos. at resting date.

Some have foreign assets. Take a power to p’pone in special

cases. As in Transpt. Bill.

[Exit J.G.

[Enter Hall &amp; McNeil

6. Shipping Policy.

P.M. Refer this to L.P. Cttee.

Agreed.

7. Palestine: Arrest of Ships on High Seas.

H. Don’t press it now.

J. W.E.B. didn’t say it was legal – only tht. this was best ground to

defend it.

C.J. Must accept this &amp; try other means. E.g. cuttg. off cash from U.S.A.

E.B. has spoken to Byrnes. Press Jews not to do it.

No more pro tem.
