217

E.B. I must consider posn of men comg. out – many are skilled as apprentices.

Choice: detain people who shd. be out, for sake of protectg.

apprentices.

Who should present? I think M/Labour. Agreed.

Mention “commitments” in announcing (in agreemt.

9. U.N.O. Publication of Proceedings e.g. of Security Council.

H.D. Stronger case for apprentices than students. Take fewer of them &amp;

Do Cab. support my view in favour of publn as St. Office publns.

Agreed.

Strachey.

A. Head of biggest tribe in Bechuanaland. Wanted to come to Ldn. to

for support.

saying don’t like it but can’t stop it. Smuts’ reaction violent:

object to Smuts’ plan for incorpn. Cdn’t get here unless we

issued priority for him. Has telegraphed to Labour leaders

His tribe = 400 m. fr. border of S.W. Africa.

Union = independent State, applying on own to U.N.O. Smuts has

consulted inhabitants.

Asked Smuts’ leading offl. – he was alarmed – I delayed telegrams

218

x/ Chief has no locus standi: wd. cause trouble in Union &amp; wd.

provoke demand for incorpn of Bechuanaland etc.

Chief wants to bargain – a road to Walfish Bay in return for w’drawg. his objn.

P.M. Why shdn’t our H. Commr. see the Chief &amp; choke him off with x/.

P.M. Main thing is to avoid trouble with Smuts.

Get the man stopped.

Decided therefore play for time by asking for his memo.

Friends of Africa will be annoyed if we stop him coming: Smuts if we

allow him to come.

A. V. well.

[Enter Barnes: B. Smith

11. World Food Supplies. for B. Zone.

Put on record – co-opn of B.S. &amp; valuable assistance of his officials.

accompanied me.

H.M. Latest telegr. U.S. started makg. supplies available for May loading

Also of B. Embassy in W’ton. And F.O. &amp; M/Ag. staffs who

B.S. Read telegram from Hutton.

H.M. Typical of U.S. official troubles. But agreement with Cl. Anderson &amp;

Clayton was firm, w’in limits of what is available &amp; recognising

deficit of 700.000. Our people in W’ton must keep on seeing tht.

it will be implemented.

P.M. C.P. 209 is valuable memo. App. I. on stocks shows the spread

betwn. a) &amp; c).

B.S. Imposs. to forecast Sept. stocks with certainty. Most unreliable

factor is level of U.S. exports.

Deficit of 700.000 will mean further cuts in wh. U.K. will share.

M/Ag. estimate of threshings: optimistic: also only eats into

future supplies.

Canadian supplies: freeze-up point.

Minimum working stock. 700.000. Independent enquiry by Sinclair’s

nominee.

Rationing. Shdn’t be mentioned for a month.

P.M. Will this mean people taking their full ration &amp; eating more than now?

E.W. Para. 4 of App. III will help to meet this.

T.W. Memo. 209 relates exclusively to wheat. My informn is flour stocks 219

are also heavy.

These figures seem to assume continn of extn at 90%. I was told to say

ourselves in a posn to control consumptn via rationing.

figures.

On M/F. assumptn (c) there will also be ….. of flour.

If steps set out in memo. 200 are authd, we shall get my figures unless

there is a complete failure of weather.

to farmers “only tempy”.

E.Sh. App. III. What is estimated weekly consumptn on this scheme?

B.S. As now. Point here is to get control: can put up or down acc. to

posn.

H.M. a) Pipeline b) Consumptn.

Want enquiry on a) to see what economies cd. be secured, even at

cost of more wasteful use of transport. Shd. try first to save the

200.000 t. in the pipeline.

This wd. increase risk of brk. down here &amp; there. Cd. be pol. &amp;

socially disturbing. All the more nec. to get control over

distn &amp; consumptn of bread.

Uncertainties of world supply: may give even gter. shocks &amp;

interruptions.

Here also is a case for control.

All my instincts are v. rationing. But, even so, if we squeeze the

pipe-line, &amp; are compelled with regret to admit tht. we must put

P.M. Support in principle.

A. a) This will have to be justified. Shd. re-consider decn not to announce

How can you make the case for this w’out use of figures.

Propose therefore study method of presentns.

b) Want re-examinn of internal distribn. Millers will resist change.

H.M. Have asked W’ton a) to agree tht. my statement was accurate

b) to get authy for release of allocn figures.

But doubt if we. cd. use stock figures.

E.W. Will this have good effect in U.S.

H.M. Yes: will re-inforce what I said in W’ton re stocks.

E.Sh. Differential rationing. How defend this, in view of resistance of

miners’ claim to more food?

P.M. They cd. eat all the bread they wanted.

P.M. Freeze-up. Cdn’t alternative ports be used?

B.S. We do: but it’s uneconomic.

220

Real point is they won’t have enough wheat to build up on e. seaboard.

Think we take all we can fr. the west.

P.M. Get the Canadians to look at this.

Agreed: proceed with plans for rationing.

P.M. Ty. to consider.

12. Railway Charges.

T.W. Extraction rate?

P.M. No decision to-day.

E.B. Staff. What of a switch fr. other rationing schemes e.g. petrol.

Feeding stuffs.

T.W. All I want is to warn keepers where they’ll be for next 7 months.

P.M. Announce on basis of middle assumption (not worst).

Memo. postponed.

Memo. approved.
