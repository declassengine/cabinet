C.M. 85(46). 10th October, 1946.

1. Paratroopers in Malaya. [Enter Bellenger &amp; W.W.

B. Statement to-day. J.A.G. advise procdgs. can’t stand: &amp; I’m

quashing convictions.

In view of misdirectn of evce of accused: irregularities

prejudicing accused.

Trial as a whole unsatisf. [Exit Bellenger.

2. Parliament.

H.M. Business for the week.

J. Nuremburg Judgmt. – to be publd as Cmd. Paper.

3. King’s Speech Committee.

P.M. Announced membership. [Exit W.W.

4. Palestine.

P.M. Take note only. Discuss when E.B. available.

5. South West Africa.

P.M. As in brief.

A. S.A. will strongly resist independent U.N. enquiry &amp; will expect our

(iii) consultns were in accord with normal tribal practice.

support.

Earlier Cab. formula will, they think, reflect on them.

Asked Hailey (out there) for his view: he has no doubt (i) fair

explann given (ii) opinion of natives freely given

Enquiry made was as good as any you will get.

If we don’t support them, they will assume we doubt their bona fides.

Will gravely prejudice our relations with S. Africa.

P.M. Not a ques. wtr. we think this fairly done – ques. of precedent for

action elsewhere. Will mean we must accept enquiry done by

other people’s local officials.

342

McN. Fair chance Smuts will lose this at Assembly.

Para. 7. goes beyond support at Assembly. Such a statement wd. go

far qua precedent. At least say we will await what evce is submd

in Assembly Debate.

USSR. say it’s all properly done: we shd. then have to accept it.

can we run ahead of that and say we are satisf. now

P.M. Parallel case. P.M. of a Balkan State: we believe it to be all crooked:

We are satisf. if the methods adopted prove agreeable to U.N. But .

That wasn’t the issue.

P.M. Same as Austr. &amp; N.Z. Mandates (C.)

P.M. Cd. we not support Smuts appln if

Wd. be diff. if some disinterested persons had been there.

Stupid of Smuts not to have done so.

C.J. Also form of ques. was unfortunate. Alternative govt. by another

Power.

Public endorsement of Smuts appln now wd. embarrass us i) in considn

of our own agreemts. in U.N. ii) in controversies in Kenya etc.,

where local Europ. opposed our trusteeship proposals.

A. This is diff. Mandate – territory was to be treated as integral part of

Union.

A. Suppose we defer expressing a view – we’ll have to decide then.

U.N. satisfied with methods used.

establd: and we might get somewhere on ques. of citizenship.

He will go on - &amp; we shall have offended him to no purpose. Agreed.

Read out formula provided by R.S.C. Confidence in S. Afr. intentns

tho’ for U.N. to say wtr. they are satisfied that it is enough.

C.J. Try to persuade Smuts to p’pone. M’while Trust. machinery wd. be

Needn’t come to Assembly. Can carry on pro tem. under mandate.

This wd. ease tension among Africans.

A. He has given notice. He dared w’draw it – for fear of Malan etc.

No hope of getting him to p’pone.

P.M. Get P.Q. p’poned. Agreed.

C.J. Still leaves the embarrassmt. for us in negotiating our Trust.

agreements at U.N.

P.M. This formula leaves it to U.N.

Talk to Smuts when he arrives. (Agreed.) about the line we may have

to take in discns at U.N. See wtr. R.S.C. formula wd. meet him.

McN. Find out, too, what Smuts will do if defeated in U.N. 343

6. Nuremberg Sentences.

P.M. Telegram re Nuremburg sentences. Jodl wants to be shot vice hanged. U.S. &amp; Fr. favour it. Others

opposed.

Need we intervene? Can we allow it to be settled by C. Council.

P.M. Von Papen: wants to return to place where arrested. Then he will be interned under Cat. 2. – for wh. maximum penalties not yet

prescribed.

H.M. Why not let him go to B. Zone and get interned? Good for him.

R.S.C. What alternative?

J. Don’t appear to try again a man whom the court has acquitted.

A.B. .. .. .. be giving him sanctuary.

P.M. Instruct not to admit to B. Zone.

7. Importation of Danish Meat.

T.W. View of my vet. staff v. strong. All our experience indicates there is ground for apprehensions – details of outbreaks in Denmark.

Not enough to stop imports if outbrk. occurs – damage wd. then

be done. We shd. lose our herds &amp; our milk.

Ton for ton D. meat no more dangerous than Argentine. But door to

Europe wd. be open with what consequences? T.W. Pedigree stock. U.S. restrict admn even now to cattle wh. has bn.

For Cab. to decide wtr. need for meat is so great as to over-ride this

risk.

A. Might backslide. Our reputn for pedigree stock might suffer.

P.M. Denmark gets on well enough with f. &amp; m.

in quarantine for 6 wks. in Canada.

L.P. Cttee seemed on this occasion to be biased v. the vets! Wished therefore to be sure Cab. agreed to run this risk.

If U.S. zone wants meat from us, cdn’t Danish meat go there?

Are we re-exporting any foreign meat?

P.M. Can’t Denmark take precautions wh. we have insisted on in Argentine.

The Dan. adminn is better surely?

T.W. They wd. do their best. But opens another source.

344

J.S. Danes willing to accept all the conditions wh. we impose on Argentine

U.S. Zone point. We haven’t agreed to make the loan: &amp; won’t unless

they assure us of repaymt. of 30,000 t. wh. we lent last year.

Agreed: Take the risk.

J.S. I am ready to go ahead.

P.M. Wait until I have received T.U.C. deputn?

P.M. Decide: but p’pone announcement until after T.U.C. deputn – if

Agreed: Grant extra meat ration for miners.

A. Evce that f. &amp; m. is spread by imported meat is v. doubtful.

Care &amp; adminn of Danes much better than in Argentine.

Balance in favour of the meat.

J.W. Support the case put by T.W.

E.Sh. Then may we take firm decision on extra meat for miners.

E.Sh. T.U.C. have agreed. They are coming to you only on procedure.

Tewson thinks it may offend them. I will tell M/F. when he may

announce.

Let P.M. inform M/F. when this may be announced.

8. a) Mr Churchill’s Book. Ministers were frank &amp; aggressive. E.g. to Curtin. W.S.C.

P.M. E.B. had said publn wd. be awkward at the moment. But publn won’t

be for 2-3 years.

Objns to earlier applns taken on basis of damaging confl. relations:

secrecy of documents: foreign relations.

A. Considered from angle of Doms. Told tht. his telegrams to Dom:

plan is to give his text and only gist of reply. Dom. Ministers

wd. object. Can’t let him publish w’out consent of Dom. Govt.

concerned – either his message or the reply.

R.S.C. Not for them to consent to his message. That is for us to censor, at

the 2nd stage when he submits his book, on grounds of inter-Dom. relations.

Agree with the general line.

McN. W.S.C. evidently envisages this procedure.

McN. No interim publn?

P.M. No.

345

b) Sherwood’s Life of Harry Hopkins. Have examd documents – no objn involved.

P.M. Appln for leave to publish documents produced to Hopkins by

B’brook on production programmes.

Suggest we agree so far as concerns H.M.G.
