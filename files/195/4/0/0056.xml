C.M. 72(46). 23rd July, 1946.

Palestine. Large propn of my staff are dead, missing or wounded. This loss of

a) Large-scale searches to liquidate J. resistance movement –

b) Final political situation.

G.H. Casualties: 41 killed 52 miss. 53 injured.

staff has created sitn wh. can only be dealt with by drastic

action by H.M.G.

Shaw has consulted Exec. Council &amp; G.O.C.: &amp; offers alternatives –

state of war.

Prefers (b). Further negotns with Zionists imposs. Immed. partition on

H.M.G.’s terms. Won’t be accept. to local Arabs. But believe

Arab League might accept if bound. conserv. drawn.

P.M. We have evce tht. earlier outrages implicated Hagana as well as

Irgun &amp; Stern.

No evce tht. this was work of any but extremists.

Our prev. action strengthened constitutionalists. Wd. be mistake

therefore to drive all Jews into extremist camp – esp. when no evce who is respons. for this.

rejected by Actg. H.C. &amp; G.O.C.

E.B. Read telegram sent y’day to W’ton. Asking for strong &amp; prompt

condemn by U.S. Govt. Reply: Byrnes is seeing President.

On a) agree with P.M. Until we have evce of responsibility, doubt

on Sunday in Paris. Then you cd. have U.S. decision before

Mistake to take sudden pol. decn when Anglo. U.S. talks going well.

On (a) H.C. said we shd. be invitg. immed. war. See this soln

Other suggns – sequestrate funds or stop legal immigrn. What effect?

Wdn’t unite Jews v. Stern gang.

My view: press for agreemt. with U.S. Try to announce tht. policy

&amp; rally support for it.

Propose to try for immediate decln by U.S.

effect.

Doubt b) – afraid of imposing Partition. Wait for confce – may come

out of that.

Brook. Position of Anglo-U.S. talks.

H.M. Slackness in security arrangemts. in Jerusalem. Govt. shd. report on

that.

Because of loss of civil staff, mil. will have to take charge.

Against (b).

Shd. go ahead with W. Paper. 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. Wed.

E.B. Timing. If we got agreement with U.S. this week. Cd. meet Byrnes

Debate - &amp; announce it because it has leaked. Telegraph

296

summary of plan to Jews &amp; Arabs before announcing it.

A.V.A. Need for firm statement to-day. Diff. to be rushed over long-term

policy. But if we seem to be giving way because of violence.

P.M. Not proposing to be diverted by violence from what we regard as right

policy - &amp; wd. say so to-day.

J. Right to say that. But on immediate action. W.P. will show leaders of

Agency came to an agreemt. with dissident organns. This outrage

is prob. the work of one of them. No peace in Pal. so long as

these criminals are about. Isn’t this a chance to get Agency to

stamp out these organisations.

A.B. Unwisdom now of publishing evce associatg. Agency with these

organns – timing.

P.M. I said there was a connn. Shall be faced with it. Ready to try the Provincial scheme. Say we propose it. Positive

A.V.A. List of incidents published in Times to-day. Fatal to delay publn.

H.M. Also undesirable to publish this evce &amp; policy statement

simultaneously.

The leaders have also a share of responsibility – for flirting with

violence.

E.Sh. The long-term policy won’t satisfy the dissidents.

Remember too tht. there is a background – wh. influences the leaders.

policy is only solution - &amp; early production of it.

Decision: Reject alternative (a)

Expedite search for long-term solution with

U.S. Not diverted by violence.

?Invite world Jewry to stand v. violence &amp;

root it out.

A.B. Consider psychology. Can Agency co-operate w’out a long-term

policy.

P.M. Won’t accept that unreasonable attitude. Trying for a short-cut by

terrorism.

Decision: Publish W. Paper to-morrow as planned.

G.H. Statement to-day. Put forward draft.

C.A.S. In reply to ques. – find it diff. to believe tht. w’spread search for arms

wd. provoke war.

Told so on last occasion – but casualties only 3.

297

P.M. Insecurity of H.Q. Jerusalem. Shd. be a report on that.

H.M. Shd. mil. be given a chance to think again re a) – in view of

C.A.S. statement.

Agreed.
