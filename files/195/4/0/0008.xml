C.M. 20(46). 4th March, 1946.

1. Spain.

E.B. Note recd protestg. v. interfce with intern. affairs of Spain.

Agree with U.S. note. France may wish to alter it. I propose to

stand on U.S. draft &amp; present it.

Beware of Sov. Policy here, worked thro’ Fr. Communists.

Danger to Gib.

Don’t want civil war in Spain. Also diffy. re supplies to U.K. fr.

Spain, e.g. fertilizers thro’ Spain. Have asked Dpts. to consider

altern. sources.

Some processg. of phosphates now done in Spain shd., even on

defence grds., to be done in U.K.

R.S.C. Diff. to get labour even for what processing we do.

E.B. U.S. have found way round that, by machinery. We shd.

experiment.

M/S. must also consider iron ore, pyrites &amp; resin: qua altern. sources.

Form of alternative Govt. If Franco goes, Sp. may drift into chaos.

E.W. Spoke in favour of a strong line.

E.B. Fr. proposed appeal to Sec. Council. Can’t see how it can be got

before them under the Charter. Will however ask Att. Genl. to

verify.

2. Persia.

E.B. Have presented Note &amp; await Sov. reply. Read out note x/.

If refce to S. Council, better let it come fr. Persia – not fr. another

gt. Power.

U.S. will support them if they do appeal: tho’ they wdn’t send a corr.

Note.

x/ recited informn: called attn to Art. 5 of Treaty: as 2/9 was

end of war with G.’s satellites 2/3 = end of 6 mos’. period:

we have w’drawn: have you – if not, what are yr. intentns:

any failure to go by 2/3 is regarded by us as breach of

obligns to H.M.G. under Treaty.

A.B. Has Press given sufft. publicity to fact tht. B. troops have bn.

w’drawn?

P.M. I will mention to-day in Def. Debate.

3. Syria and Lebanon.

E.B. Agreed 30/4 as date of our w’drawal from Syria. Will get on with

54

Lebanon.

H.D. Hope equivalent will come home fr. M/East. Otherwise no saving.

E.B. Bound to increase total releases fr. overseas. 9.000 relief now

+ 6.000 more when we clear Lebanon.

[Enter N.B., Barnes &amp; Summerskill.

4. Sabotage of Ships.

B. Enquiry apptd. No informn yet.

5. World Food Supplies.

P.M. Sent B. Smith over on immed. issue, particularly to support Indian

Delegn.

H.M.’s memo. raises, however, more far-reachg. long-term issues.

H.M. Gap increasing at ½ m.t.p. week.

Evidence tht. Truman’s advisers are not agreed in moving him to

vigorous action to increase sowings. Ques: wtr. we can do

anything to stimulate. Canada (reply to P.M.) is also

hesitant.

U.S. is not doing even what they have decided shd. be done

viz., falling down on existg. p’mme, which is not enough

anyway.

Unthinkable that we cd. hold our own posn if Empire countries were

really short. When the time came we shd. have to surrender

part of our own supplies.

Why shd. we take lead – because largest importer &amp; natural political

leader of importers.

Para 6(a) met by despatch of M/Food.

Para 6(b) – long-term contracts in principle appd by Cabinet. Cd. we

not persuade French, Indians etc., to do same thing for U.S.

wheat? Remember how diff. an approach it is to U.S. farmers

w’out some such assurance. If U.S. Govt. will give the

assurance, good &amp; well: but if not we shd. try to get other

countries to place contracts.

Para 6(c) - consequences of famine. Let U.S. Govt. know, too, as

well as Cab.

Picture of what is coming.

Conclude with warning in para. 7.

Problem: how to handle U.S.? B.S. can do it w’in limitns of present

Mission. But Truman &amp; Acheson must be got going on this.

Wondered wtr. E.B. cd. go both to Washington &amp; Ottawa mtg. of

S. Council: he might go out in advance of that. Our duty to

U.K., B. Comm. &amp; whole world is to take early and vigorous

action.

55

T.W. C.P.(46) 24. For 46/47 there will be 7 m. less for export than for

45/46. If that estimate is correct, next year will be worse than

this – except to extent tht. Europe does better.

If Canada adheres to 2 yrs. wheat + 1 yr. fallow, we shan’t get what

world wants.

Canada exportg. 61/4 m. this year, as against normal 4 m.

Agree with approach in C.P.(46) 90.

If surplus in 46/47, cd. be used for reserve – e.g. in India.

P.M. How cd. other countries finance long-term contracts with U.S. ? Export

&amp; Import Bank, tied loans?

H.D. Threat to our dollar &amp; gold reserves.

Prepd to agree to 6(b). $1. Can. dollar – no higher – floor.

Wd. like to hear more of Australia.

T.W. 1 m. tons this year: assumg. 3 m. next year. We are relying on

Australia.

H.D. Don’t let us get commd to v. big quantities too far ahead.

How do we know what will happen to harvests of year after next.

France may recover quickly. And they are going to buy wheat

from Russia.

E.B. R. are offering wheat to Greece, too!

H.D. Needn’t yet look at Bank proposals.

E.S. Our experts don’t want us to give assurances of purchases from U.S.

P.M. That is not proposed. We are talking about needs of other countries.

A.B. Can you expedite mtg. of Agr. Ministers on 4/4.

N.B. Summoned by EECE. Directed to autumn sowings &amp; slaughter of

livestock.

For spring sowing, trouble is seed. Trying to get alternatives

to grain e.g. potatoes.

A.B. Para. 7. W. Paper to show what we are doing &amp; have done.

But cdn’t we get European P.M.’s before 4/4?

T.W. Europe – dilemma: eat the seed or sow it?

We cd. get them to look fwd. to autumn: doubt if it wd. consider

this spring’s ques.

R.S.C. Shall we try in these circs. to continue C.F.B.

E.S. Yes – in diff. form.

56

E.Sh. Remember not to forget Argentine.

P.L. Austr. new sowg. not avail. until Jan. ’47. India must look to

N. Hemisphere for immed. needs.

E.B. No time to make up my mind.

Reluctant to concentrate on U.S. I can’t go to U.S. w’out

implying tht. I shall discuss other things too.

Too much concentn on N. America. Wd. rather diffuse it. What

have we done to increase exports fr. S. Am. countries.

Drama no longer has any effect on U.S.

Acheson is only person who can get on with this.

If you want pol. issue pressed, I wd. rather raise it first thro’

Ambassador. It is U.S. statesmen who must do it. Doubt if they

will do it on my intervention. Get a slogan across e.g. “munitions

for peace”. First round via offl. channels. May be that someone shd. go over later.

U.S. farmers – trouble: went on until 1920 growg. wheat &amp; got

unbalanced agriculture: wheat sank to 35c. and countryside

starved. Not until FDR. came in did they recover the balance

of their agriculture.

How can the guaranteed price for 4 yrs. meet that?

T.W. Wd. help them to plan the transition. Wd. emphasise fact that high wheat prodn can’t go on for ever.

E.B. 20m. acres at 9 cwt. p. acre. in U.S.

Cd. you diffuse the demand. Is there world shortage of seed?

Have bn. assured whole of R. acreage will be filled this year. She cd.

get export surplus of 2/3rds prodn. Ought therefore to carry

Poland, Czechosl. etc., and relieve UNRRA.

Not yet convinced this is right method.

P.M. x/ Resume discn at W.F.S. Mtg. Tuesday. Turned into a Cabinet Meeting.

A. a) Shd. be much larger European prodn next year. Not sure our

estimates take enough a/c of that.

b) Some long-term assurance – at least 4 years – will be necessary

for Canada.

Because they can’t forget what happened last time.

Wd. have to apply to Australia.

E.B. Supply India from Australia. Get Austr. to build up Indian reserve.

Wd. help pol. negotns if her food were coming fr. Austr. vice U.S.A.

Austr. wd. regard it as Pacific trade, wh. they like.

The less we are dependent on U.S. for India, the better.

Agreed as at x/.

Send immedte instn to M/F. on para. 6(a)

57

[E.B. Can A. and I talk to Beasley re Australia &amp; India?

Put pol. issues in addn to supply approach by M/F.

P.L. Ind. Food Delegn to see U.S. farmers.

P.M. No need for special authy for that.

P.M. Will G/India give guarantee for Austr. wheat. Ask them at once.

[Exit N.B., E.S.

6. Post-War Pay for Officers of Armed Forces.

P.M. Genl. explanation.

Agreed.

7. Japan: Policy towards Japanese Industry.

E.B. Para. 16. Problem: avoid German situation in wh. load falls on

B. taxpayer.

Outstanding issue = Jap. ship-building. Summarised views

pro and con.

A.V.A. Need to look after war potentials at home &amp; abroad. Consequence of

failure to do this with Germany last time. Not enough to say

J. merchant bldg. reached only 400.000 t. That enabled her to

develop such technique tht. she cd. build up strong naval yards.

Realise you can’t hold down J for ever: but can do until they

prove their bona fides. Referred to E.I.P.S. paper. This bldg.

cdn’t be prevented by the steel ceiling proposed.

Importce of merchant tonnage in war.

P.M. Cd. her navy be effective if allowed no aircraft?

A.V.A. Both factors equally powerful.

E.B. 3.5 m. tons of steel wdn’t leave much surplus for shipping. You

eliminate aircraft entirely. You destroy the big yards. That shd.

be enough.

If you allow no m. marine, there will be load on B. taxpayer.

B. Easiest to enforce. Most effective handicap for island race.

If aircraft prohibited, follows that shipping shd. too.

J.J.L. Island with that popn must live on exports – must have some

m. marine.

Isn’t this the chance to deal with cheap J. exports.

58

R.S.C. Two aspects. a) security b) rival trade. Agreed we adopt only

a) as criterion.

On a) you make minimum prohibns because otherwise the thing won’t

be enforced. As with G. before – not because we didn’t try

enough but because people reacted v. too much.

Concentrate therefore on minimum. She must export. If she has,

not only to forego shipping earnings, but also to pay for shipping

she needs, she will be forced into consumers’ goods.

A.V.A. Quoted, v. this, para. 12 of E.I.P.S. memo.

Also p.4 of that memo. – shipbuilding control is v. economic of staff.

A.B. I believe E.B.’s memo. proposes too many restns.

Believe all you can do is inspn at finishing stage. Then have rest of

economy free. Otherwise you impose on J. low standards of life.

That is the biggest threat to world trade: and biggest source of

future aggressions.

H.D. What are views of Austr. &amp; N.Z.?

A. Haven’t replied to our enquiry. Assume that means no strong views on

our memo. 78. But I must consult if we allow them to build big

ships.

J. Agreed: must get Dom. views.

Shipbldg. is an easy thing to control: I sympathise with it fr.

enforcemt. angle.

H.D. Submit pros &amp; cons on ship-bldg. &amp; invite their views.

E.B. Were told we were holdg. up. Doms. have had this for wks. Why

don’t they reply?

A. Will get reply by Friday.

P.M. Do so.

Adjourned until Friday.

8. Shipbuilding Advisory Committee.

A.V.A. As in memo.

P.M. We suggd person not necessarily repres of Unions as such. Was that put?

H.M. Impossible to put shipowners on but not seamen.

Way-out: have no users permanently on, but bring users in (both of

them) for specl. mtgs. affecting them.

R.S.C. Principle: thought we wished to avoid syndicalist system 59

throughout.

Have had same opposn fr. industries to my proposals for outside repres.

But have overcome it.

B. But here we have repres of Govt. Dpts.

A.V.A. Cttee of this kind has bn. workg. since ’44 &amp; seamen have never asked

to be on it.

P.M. Either we put both on, despite objns, or adopt compromise suggd above.

x/ General view: put both on, despite objns.

E.Sh. What will shipbuilders say then?

A.V.A. Asked them if they wd. accept if Chairman got guidance to refer to

sub-Cttees some users’ points.

Agreed as at x/.

9. British Council in Spain: Employment of Roman Catholics.

Agreed.
