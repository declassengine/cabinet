C.M. 35 (46) 15th April, 1946

1. Greece.

A.B. Populists takg. action in resp. of Request as makes Cab. residuary legatee for King. P.I.D. Summary – Press to-day confirms.

E.B. Latest telegram suggests it’s being cleared up. Gk. Cab. considering resignn . No final decision – must wait – but looks as if it’s clearing up.

[Enter J.W.

2. Iron &amp; Steel Industry.

E.B. Reviewed by Silk Cttee. Doubt whtr emergency powers will suffice – regulation only, but no power to acquire or build. Legn necessary therefore - &amp; tht. will raise the genl. issue. But anxiety in Unions of industry re stagnation: short Bill wdn’t drag on &amp; cd. be introduced earlier. Cd. make a start on development by agreemt. Proposal therefore to discuss with industry – as in memo. Delay of 1-2 yrs. for major legn wd. be serious for e.g. Wales when industry

can’t recover w’out new plant because men won’t work old processes.

Think some announcemt. shd. be made this week. Talks beginning afterwds.

} you like Parly. announcemt. cd. follow next day. e.g. trade on

Govt. wd. anyway have to find large sums for redevelopmt. This gives unusual hold over trade even w’out natn powers.

Spurt at present – exceedg. 1938 output: but unbalanced &amp; can’t be maintained w’out development &amp; reconstn.

Unions are reasonable. Say if legn is difficult, tell us: &amp; we’ll accept a compromise interim solution.

Think M/Supply shd. bring Transport Union into consultns re finishing side.

P.M. Announcement: v. important.

E.B. P.M. &amp; L.T. can settle that.

P.M. Suggd talks first. Leakage already. Can’t let it come out thro’ trade.

H.D. I had put that point in discn with Cttee. But authorise M/S. to send for leaders on both sides in day or two. Then you might p’pone announcemt. until after Easter Recess. Wd. help to secure co-operative attitude of leaders of industry if they were told first. But if

X } Tuesday

} Parlt. Wednesday.

E.B. Wraugh on severance. Terrible problem. Schedule of definitions will be v. diff. Wd. help that if we moved thro’ interim plan.

129

A.B. Developmt. by Bd. in co-opn with trade – much better than by legn – I favour prior informn to the trade.

J. Supported X/. So did M/Supply.

E.B. If you get a good agreement you mayn’t need legn. You will have to make it

clear tht. you will take powers if you need them: but if this is clearly

stated they may come in &amp; co-operate.

H.D. Agreed – younger men. are ready to co-operate in development.

P.M. Statement shd. invite co-operation. Needs revision.

E.Sh. Severance will be the diffy. – are we ready enough on that to meet the industry?

J.W. Yes – for we propose Control Bde. shd. work out detail of severance problem. We shall be inviting co-operation again.

Agreed: as at X/.

[Exit J.W. &amp; O.S.

3. Wentworth Woodhouse: Working of Open-cast Coal. P.M. Fitzwilliam coming to see me to-day re Wentworth.

Is the coal really necessary? Must it be worked on surface?

E.Sh. This was Cab. decision. Work there began in 1942, incldg. Dorie Site: this is only continuation. Deep mining impracticable

a) 2 yrs. vice 8 mos.

b) wd. have permanent surface undulations thro’ subsidence.

c) much spoil wd. have to be dumped.

d)

wd. need underground workers.

Agitn in Yorks. inspired by handful. Parly Secy. T.C.P. – formerly opponent – is now an advocate of the scheme. T.C.P. agree: contracts signed. Joe Hall, who is stirring this up, is repudiated by N.U.M. &amp; Yorks. miners.

Fitzwilliam also has bn. stirred up.

Urgent need of coal – especially these special types. Consumptn of coal by industry is rising steeply. Called for 100.000 t. of bunker coal because of U.S. strikes. Disputes – in Scotland especially.

To abandon this now wd. be sign of gt. weakness.

T.W. Has bn. said we cd. get it out this year. M/F &amp; P. say 2 years. Technical question.

H.D. Don’t re-open the compromise wh. we reached.

130

[Enter Barnes, Dugdale, A.H., Strachly &amp; Genl. Homes.

4. Passenger Shipping Requirements

B. Vital to get min. p’mme of releases if I’m to avoid interference with labour arrangemts. in ship-yards. Want at least the Apl/May minimum.

P.M. Serv. Dpts. accept – with revision of M’batten’s trooping?

J.J.L. Diffy. = 2 months’ p’ponemt. of w’drawal from N.E.I. (if settlement reached) - &amp; transfer to India: also V.G. and Greece.

E.B. How will this affect repatn of Poles? Overland we’ll never get them out of

Italy.

B.

B. Users must be severely tested – to make best use – otherwise whole pressure

comes on shipping &amp; ship bldg. industries.

H.D. Mustn’t stop flow of repatriation.

To send them to Tripolitania wd. be v. provocative – to Senussi &amp; to U.S.S.R. 4.000 on way now by sea.

P.M. Cost of hiring U.S. ships?

Don’t pay until end/Apl. when Q.M. comes off the Atlantic run. Then $11/4M. for whole of 3 months’ p’mme.

H.D. Worth spending money on repatriating troops.

P.M. Can’t afford to delay repatn or to get ourselves cramped. so we can’t move.

Suggest Cttee for this. E.g. told men are posted overseas for 2/3 wks. &amp; then brght back for discharge.

J.J.L. That is against policy: may be a few slipping thro’.

H.M. M/W.T. have done Service Dpts. v. well &amp; demobiln scheme has gone smoothly &amp; fast.

a) Ques. now: room for give &amp; take, w’out affectg. genl. rate of

demobilisation, to give this handful of civilians a fair deal. Many have bn. out for 8 years: children growing up: they are as homesick as Servicemen: can’t be indifferent to their position.

b) If some ships can be reconverted, sooner we can get our mercantile ???? into being – to take chances offering thro’ departures of G. It. &amp; Jap. Matter of months to get in.

G.H. Civilian mainly adminve officers – morale v. low.

Arrangemt. discussed on Sat. is least we cd. accept.

131

P.M. But E.B. is being met with demand to w’draw troops. Must have some ships.

E.B. U.S. sympathetic about movemt. of Poles. Are there U.S. ships now on charter to us – cd. I ask U.S. to leave them with us for this purpose.

B. Yes: v. helpful indeed.

Agreed: F.O. and M/T to consult.

B. Can’t miss the shipyards opportunities – and cause unemplyt.

Barrow is waiting for Orion.

Holmes Crucial period is from April – assistance fr. U.S. ndn’t come in until May.

Our lack is – back lift from India in May. Mountbatten if he lent me 5.000 places can still get troops out of N.E.I. = but delay in moving Indians fr. Malaya. If I got 5.000 places from M’batten, I cd. relinquish Orion.

Dugdale a) Support release of Orion – to check drift from shipyards.

b) 5 largest aircraft carriers cd. carry up to 2.000 men with conversion (wh. wd. take weeks rather than months) Wd. ease problem.

Agreed: Study this: also Y/ below.

Str. a) Civil. lift will be decreased by re-conversion of Orion.

b) Any delay in repatn of Servicemen will cause trouble. Arises from speeding up release scheme. We warned M/T. of this in Jan. – he then said it wd. be all right.

Offls. on Sat. said reconversion demanded by M/T wd. permit of repatn from India but only at expense of cutting back S.E.A.C. p’mme &amp; having no margin for contingencies. (ii) Orion. Must let her do 1 or 2 trips unless

Holmes (i) Releases for repatn &amp; Python. Civil movemt. reduced buy 2/3rds. to 6.000 a month. That is agreed. M’batten is cut down from

40.000. I can release Orion if I take 5.000 lift from M’batten.

E.B. You won’t be asked to clear all B. troops from N.E.I. by October.

H. M’batten’s plan assumes clearance by Oct. Let me take 5.000 places fr. M’batten and I will release Orion.

Agreed: release Orion on this basis.

?

(iii) P’mme assumes we shall get [10.000] places on loan from U.S.

J. Further use of R.N. ships?

H.M. Supported this suggn – on genl. economic recovery grounds /Y

Can R.A.F. machine be used by ex-pilots recruited thro’ C. Av.n? 132

B. Bringing them over short distances to ports more convenient for shipping.

Remit this to working party.

Dugd. We have brght. back 45.000 ratings.

[Exit Dugdale: Holmes:

Strachey: A.H.

[ Enter G.T.

5. Nationalisation of Transport. P.M. Most vulnerable point – man can’t carry own goods above 40 miles w’out a

licence.

B. Summd memo.

Controversy mainly on road haulage &amp; municipal transport.

C. Licences. Pre-war no restn: durg. war limit of 60 miles.

Now propose limit of 40 miles. wh. shd. cover 70% of C. journeys.

Above 40 miles only by licence on proof they are operatg.

necessarily.

P.M. Applies also to C.O.S. moving own goods.

Only a few large organisations run C. journeys above 40 miles.

A &amp; B Licences. No control under 10 miles. 10-40 free competn. Over 40 N.T.C. monopoly.

Unions will press for lower limits. C. Licence holder for full freedom. This is a compromise.

Is it necessary to stir up this political trouble? Is it necessary for protn of the monopoly.

J.W. Will be a resistance to attractg. firms to establ. in developmt. areas.

T.W. Farmers – own system for quick movemt. of perishables. This wd. cut into that.

B. They cd. get their licence.

P.M. But we shall be criticised for imposing the control at all – to bolster up monopoly.

A.B. Diffies of adminn. I want to carry own goods 50 miles occasionally – no need for licence: must I on that occasion change over to State lorry after 40 miles.

T.W. Why interfere at all with people carrying own goods. They aren’t offering to compete with State carrier.

133

B. All I propose is tht. they prove they are bona fide carrying own goods. Otherwise, it will be this type of traffic which will break the scheme. If these people are free, they can play ducks &amp; drakes.

P.M. But you said majority wdn’t go over 40 miles. It is only a few therefore who

will compete. If this monopoly is efficient, it cd. stand this

competition.

H.M. B/Trade brief v. this plan – especially qua attractg. new firms to developmt. areas.

Often a factor is willingness to go tht. they can carry own goods.

B/T. argue in favour of exemption of all C. Licences.

My own view: Cttee reconsidered on P.M.’s suggn &amp; decided in favour of M/T. Old competition system wd. wreck transpt. Case for natn is to end road

anarchy: fit road &amp; rail: so tht. State can offer comprehensive &amp;

efficient service.

a)

b)

W’out reasonably. compreh. monopoly State will be at disadvantage. If it can only pick up what is left, overheads will be too heavy.

Railways with large fixed capital &amp; maintenance charges not reqrd by road transport – history of pre war losses to road transport.

If you ignore basis of scheme you may imperil it.

No argument re A &amp; B Licences. Proposed to wipe out A Licence over 40 miles. B Licence = mixed – own goods &amp; others.

a)

H.M. Cd. consider giving direction to Traff. Commrs. on that.

C. Licence carries own goods only. Given free right over 40m. area: will cover most, incldg. many farmers.

Remember farmers will do well out of efficient State transpt. system. Cttee view: if no limit on C. licence, they might unnecessarily extend their own transport. And not easy to enforce provn they can carry only own goods – may pick up other traffic.

P.M. Cd. you exempt man who has only one vehicle?

a) Man can go to (quasi judicial &amp; independent of Minister) Traffic Commmr. for licence to travel beyond 40 miles: with appeal to a Nat-Tribunal. Perhaps apptmts cd. be made by Ld. Chancellor.

E.B. Or by the Crown, as under y. M/L Acts. See instrns. re C. licences in Appendix. (i) meets developmt. area point.

Cttee thght M/T. had made his case – subject to makg. it a bit easier, as he has. Feeling tht. if we have this quite free, we may lose or endanger whole scheme.

P.M. Inflexible for isolated journeys by man who normally doesn’t go above 40 miles.

[Enter. L.S.

134

H.M. Can’t meet that w’out according complete freedom.

P.M. Diff. to check evasion., on isolated journeys.

A.B. Demarcation betwn. State &amp; private enterprise then based, not on function, but on distance. Awkward case to argue.

Don’t believe that free C. Licences wd. endanger the State system. Carriage of goods is so complicated tht. people won’t be able to do it undetected.

Factory with depots throughout county must know how much capital to allot to transport. Shdn’t interfere with it.

Cf. Fletton bricks.

H.M. They will get a licence.

A.B. Another works with sudden order beyond 90 miles.

T.W. Movemt. of perishable goods. Mileage criterion will introduce v. complicated new factor.

E.Sh If you are going to nationalise transport, you must isolate natd system from blast of free competition.

[Exit E.B.

No reason to suppose Tr. Commrs. wd. be unreasonable in dealg. with applns - &amp; wd. grant licences in most of extreme cases quoted this a.m.

If you allow C. licence travel any distance, larger indust. firms will expand their transport organisation – wh. will be formidable competn for natd transport.

Too big a risk.

P.M. Thought you said big firm wd. readily get their licence. It is the small man who wd. get frozen out.

Will it be politically possible to refuse C. licences to these larger firms?

E.Sh. Cap. good prodn firms – if they find N.T.C. cheaper &amp; as efficient – will use it.

We’re really arguing re small men, who won’t want to use N.T.C. because own transpt. carries own advertising. Can’t let that grow, uncontrolled. Directions can be given to Commrs. – makes for flexibility.

Coal: biggest controversy was over ancillaries not collieries. Can’t make the severance – for otherwise natn wdn’t pay.

H.D. Ques. of degree &amp; phrasing. At one stage, Barnes said in certain classes applicant wd. get a licence as of right. Hurecomb didn’t like that – but I believe it wd. be politically helpful, while preservg. essential needs of stage.

G.T. No undue restn on carriage of goods by C. Licences. Gather my interest cd. be met by directions etc,. Must be – effects wd. be serious otherwise on bricks &amp; bldg. materials. 135

A. If N.T.C. is efficient, firms will wish to use it. Askg. for trouble to try to

curb those who run own lorry for own purposes. Politically v.

disadvantageous to hamper this. Perishable goods. I wd. prefer to exempt

C. Licences – unless satisfy. formula on H.D.’s lines.

J. Largely agree. But remember most of these men will want to discredit our

scheme – boycott N.T.C. on grds. of pol. prejudice. On other hand, if

licences to be granted readily, why have them? If not, how defend the

delays.

Concln = I remain on the fence.

A.G. Support P.M. We can try to do too much in natn scheme.

Cross. country journeys, firm to firm, in colln etc,. of components &amp; carriage of goods fr. one process to another.

C.E. Support P.M.

G.A.I. Support Cttee Rpt. Was doubtful re development areas: but now see how that can be met.

E.W. My doubts met. Need for flexibility in country areas. Wd. back M/T.

J.W. Favour P.M.’s view – on pol. &amp; economic grounds. Thought natd of

“transport” meant the industry carrying – not carriage of own goods.

a)

T.W. Favour P.M.

G.H. Support M/T., in my view of discussion.

J.J.L. Support P.M.

P.M. Evenly divided!

B. Licensing system. Bn. going for some years: traders familiar with it.

Cases will fall into classes. Decision on one will apply to the class.

Whichever way you decide you can’t escape controversy. T.U. opinion is on my side - &amp; even wants me to go further.

H.M. Unless N.T.C. is protected, fear it won’t be able to provide the Service.

Cd. Cabinet endorse other proposals: &amp; let my Cttee review C. Licences again.

P.M. Yes: consider

distn btwn. single vehicle owner &amp; others.

b) precisely what is danger to N.T.C. Big firms? If so, it’s just they who can’t be refused a licence.

B. And preliminary consultn with firms.

136

[Exit A.B.

B.

P.M. c) H.D.’s formula.

J.W. Para. 2 (a) Highlands &amp; Islands Steamer Services. Shd. be power to take them over.

B. Main services wd. be automatically taken over.

J.W. Optional powers in Bill.

J. Furniture removers? Incidental to depository.

Covered by trade classifn decision.

E.Sh. Para. 42 of original memo. Compensn for displaced staff. Must be consistent as possible with coal scheme.

G.T. 2nd Altern. in para. 15 is preferable – for A &amp; B Licences.

A.G. Draftsman. Many details to be worked out by Dpts. first.

P.M. Like A.I. priority demand.

H.D. Will do our best to help him. Refuse “full-time” demand. Allocate a draftsman as soon as instructions are ready.

H.D., A.G., H.M. to settle.

Scheme otherwise appd – as basis for discussions.

6. New Towns Bill

Approved. £50M.
