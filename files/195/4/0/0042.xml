C.M. 54(46). 3rd June, 1946.

1. Persia.

E.B. Sent out Labour Attache fr. Cairo: &amp; M.P.’s.

Fraser was concerned at sendg. T.U. Offls. because laws being

enacted. But A. Persian spending £7½ m. at Abadan on

for workers. I thought it better to send political vice

housing &amp; other developmts. for workers. My advice to

A.P. was to make Abadan a show place for amenities etc., industrial

repres: thus send 3 M.P.’s with industrial experience.

Worried re set-up of A.P. Really a State Co. But establd as private

Bd., the State members being intended only to keep Govt.

informed, not to introduce Govt. inspiration. Don’t suggest

views – wd. not be opposed to infusing New Britain views into

alteration now: but keep it in mind in future. When Govt. own

51% of shares, can’t escape responsibility e.g. for workers.

Fortunate in having W. Fraser as Chairman – fairly advanced

policy of Co. Hope Ty. will be more sympathetic than in past

to pol. advantage of p’ssive policy.

2. Egypt.

E.B. Will see S. this p.m. Not ready yet to tell Cab. of next step.

3. Foreign Affairs Debate. Sov. Govts.

takes a violent line to-morrow, P.M. shd. consider whether he

P.M. W.S.C. will open on 2nd day. Shall I follow him?

E.B. No objn. Then H. McN. can wind up instead of me.

Mine will be a factual statement. Will avoid antagonising U.S. or

No reply to debate on first day. i.e. E.B. &amp; none: P.M. &amp; H.McN.

Agreed.

I haven’t answered Fulton Speech. But fact we didn’t repudiate it has

made things more diff. for me in Confces. If therefore W.S.C.

shd. at once repudiate, or correct.

[Enter C.O.S.

4. Greece: Cost of Armed Forces.

E.B. Not yet clear wtr. R. will w’draw fr. Bulgaria. They have bn. bldg.

permanent barracks there: &amp; recent talk in Paris looks as tho’ they will claim to keep troops on both sides/Danube.

On other hand have bn. pressg. Gks. to produce Budget. Stability

essential to further progress twds. order.

Inflation in R.B. &amp; Hungary. If Greece don’t tackle their budgetary

by precept.

accepted by C.F.M. in June. Greek Army shd. balance

can’t carry Army of more than 50.000.

Gks. wd. like them to stay for substantial time. Want to see what

bring Greece’s Army down to peace time levels until C.F.M.

no cost to ourselves?

work out details.

Cd. then press Gk. Govt. to produce a Budget, as first step twds.

C.I.G.S. Planning (man-power) on basis of w’drawal before end/1946.

Bulgaria 56.000 }

and pol. diffy. in getting it out.

E.B. I wd. make this new grant condl. on making a truly Nat. Army.

Gks. that this

posn &amp; get steady financial policy, they will follow the others.

If they can get stability however will have profound effect on

whole area. We have bn. approached confid. for suggns for

stabilising in R. Better to proceed by practical example than

Mil. experts have arrived at figures for Satellite Armies: may be

Bulgarian. But my view has bn. that on popn of 7 m. Greece

Two stages. a) This year. Am anxious to w’draw B. troops, tho’

happens at C.F.M. in June: But aim is to w’draw by Sept. Can’t

have agreed on level of Balkan Armies. Cd. we agree in

principle to carry Gk. Army in 1946. Then decide how much

Greece shd. carry herself. Bulk of cost = equipment. We have

C.O.S. agree how much of cost is equipment wh. we cd. supply at

Food is only dollar cost. UNRRA can’t supply to Armed Forces.

Equipment &amp; food = £15 m., of which about £2 m. is food.

Compromise, prs. that Greece shd. pay for the food (she has

Agree in principle to 1946. Meet this week (F.O., Ty. &amp; C.O.S.) to

Don’t want to have legislation if it can be avoided.

stability in Balkans.

Yugosl. 350.000 } Latest figures.

If so, 100.000 Gks. cdn’t hold the frontier. 50.000 wd. be swamped

at once. 100.000 wd. be a minimum.

Training of Gk. Army is going fairly well. Too much old wood at top,

H.D. Finance. Gks. got a £10 m. loan in Jan. Haven’t done much to carry

out quid pro quo of financial reforms. Gk. Budget cdn’t carry

100.000 Army. If they had to have it, we wd. have to subsidise.

Not an acceptable plan. Agree 1946 is a transitional year. But if

they don’t go down to 50.000 soon they will be a continuing

burden on us.

Against serious trouble, no diff. betwn. 50.000 &amp; 100.000.

Ready to finance what is necessary for 1946. But want it clear with ends with 1946.

Equipment. My estimate = only £1¾ m. Ready to throw that in.

227

Ready to throw in value of some R.N. ships on loan: say, £2 m.

[C.N.S. Value of present loan is nearer £4 m.]

v. far. Unwilling to use B. money to support a Royalist Army

in Greece. Putting at disposal of King, if he returns, an armed

Force. What assurances have we on this? Until position is

difficult.

Don’t want to go on pouring out sterling, still less dollars.

A.B. What about para. 9 of C.P. 203?

Endorse (1). But (2) goes a v. long way. Last phrase wd. commit us

clear, I think we shd. limit our offers to 1946.

E.B. That must be read with para. 1. I didn’t press this to-day.

A.B. Object also to “larger” in 9(3).

P.M. Will E.R. reject [ ] in 9(2)?

E.B. I w’draw those words. *

E.B. If we can liquidate troops in Italy &amp; Austria, it will relieve us to

extent of 150.000 troops. This is the prize I’m staying for.

J.J.L. Estimate of £15 m. for Army of 100.000 is v. high.

We wd. put it at £8-10 m.

E.B. This is one reason why I want expert examn.

J.J.L. No diffy. over initial supply of equipment. Replacement is always

Real diffy. is to get Gks. to get a move on.

Amend 9(3) by omitting “larger” &amp; limiting to 1946. *

A. Dom. support. There is division of opinion in Doms. Evatt wd. say:

don’t wait upon USSR. Smuts wd. say stay. I shan’t get

unanimous reply.

E.B. But put it to them none the less.

Agreed: inform persuasively &amp; hope for the best.

5. Polish Troops under British Command.

C.E. Proclamation by Anders to his troops. Will make this much more diff.

for H.O.

E.B. Am getting exact text before making up my mind.

A.B. This is what frightens U.S.S.R.

228

E.B. Hoping U.S. will take some – have obtained support of Mark Clark &amp;

Eisenhower.

A. Canada wd. take more if pressed.

P.M. Cabinet must consider.

E.B. Am not going to let these men down.

France may now take some.

Doms. are a disgrace: we own 1/6th of the world &amp; can’t absorb

200.000!

6. Malaya. report in a week.

E.B. Can you raise standards of living in Malaya at prices of tin &amp; rubber on

Before agreement is reviewed, we shd. tell U.S. firmly that she

H.D. L.P. Cttee considered at gt. length – F.O. representative attending &amp;

G.H. As in Minute to P.M.

Concern mainly over extension of Malayan citizenship.

Hope discussions will lead to satisf. settlement. Expect to be able to

A.G. No indicn of impending diffies. Believe settlement is possible on lines

of W. Paper declaration.

wh. U.S. are now insisting. U.S. shd. be pressed and shamed

over this.

can’t lecture us on Imperialism &amp; in same breath grind us down

to these low prices.

P.M. Let us have a report on this.

supporting low price.

E.B. I’m looking ahead. Not askg. to re-open recent agreement. But let

us have more informn &amp; advice before next time. I will put in a

memo.

H.D. Then don’t take rubber in isolation – bring in tin etc.

D.S.I.R. to enquire (on basis of informn from M/Health)

into carbo-hydrate from tropics.

C.O. to report to P.M. on Food Yeast.
