C.M. 73(46). 25th July, 1946.

1. Palestine.

P.M. Publication – against W. Paper. Prefer announcement in a debate –

if agreement with U.S. Govt. reached.

E.B. Important to tell U.S. Govt. thro’ State Dpt. that we accept this.

Stress fact that this is basis for negotiations.

2. Parliament. E.B. Mission to G.?

W.W. No. Estimates Cttee, whose report will be publd at 11 a.m. to-day.

H.M. Oppn chose the subject. Can’t help that. F.O., Duchy &amp; W.O. are all

H.M. Business for the week.

E.B. Knew nothg. of this. Dangerous – Peace Confce opening etc.

concerned.

H.D. Estimates Cttee are concerned only with economy w’in limits of

policy – debarred from considering policy. Their rpt. need not

be embarrassing.

E.B. Told they will traverse coal.

A.B. Shdn’t E.B. be absent, to avoid policy ques’s.

H.M. Respect to H/C. They cd. properly refer to treatg. G. as an economic

whole.

A.V.A. V. dangerous if H/C. allowed to range widely over that at present.

W.W. Last debate Opposn asked wtr. too much money wasn’t being spent.

That’s what they will talk on. H.D. shdn’t be there.

E.Sh. Ask Opposn what they intend. But can’t see how policy can be

divorced from Adminn.

P.M. In view of Paris they shd. be asked not to debate this.

W.W. They say they are only on cost of adminn.

P.M. Can’t stop Private Members fr. ranging wider.

299

E.B. My discussion with U.S. will be made more diff. by public discussion.

P.M. Ask Opposn to lay off. If they won’t, try to limit debate.

W.W. to see them &amp; bring in E.B. if necessary.

Palestine.

P.M. Will it be mainly on current situation – if so, C.O.

E.B. If U.S. gives quick approval, cd. we separate the debate. First day

on current ques: second on long-term. Wd. like to keep them

separate. Invitns to Arab States have gone out.

day will be hamstrung otherwise.

H.M. Difficult. Policy statement shd. be at beginning. Spkers on first

P.M. Yes: for complts. will be that situation was due to past. If you get

debate on to long-term little recriminn re past. G.H. Agree: statement vice

A. Also provisionally fixed H/Lds. debate for Wed.

W. Paper. [Enter N.B.

Worried at suggn against putting it out as W. Paper.

P.M. Want identic. statements here and in U.S. Better than W. Paper

Agreed: statement on policy on first day.

H.M. Parly. Delegn to Denmark &amp; Scandinavia – Food &amp; Agric. Group.

start allowg. domestic groups to go abroad, where does it end?

T.W. I said we had official delegns there in Sept. Se. offls. also going.

May avoid discn if this made at outset.

Wd. prefer debate to be mainly on policy – forget the past.

A.B. Separately - &amp; positive side first.

here only.

M/Ag. cd. authorise if he certifies in publ. interest. But if we

All I did was to offer facilities for rpts etc.

P.M. Must stop this. Agreed. M/Ag. to decline.

1. (contd) Palestine.

Brook. Explained scheme. Was thanked.

E.B. Jews have come round to Partition. Believe this scheme wd. work.

Arabs wd. oppose Partition. They might accept this; and grow 300

twds. Partition.

Alarmed at going to Assembly – save prs. on report basis. Want to

getting a foot in.

E.Sh. 1) Excellent basis: press on with it. 2) Care in bringing this to

on it because of opposn of A. or J. There may be greater oppn

Collective trusteeship frightens me – cdn’t keep the troops there.

reserve my position on that. Ques. of tactics. Risk of Russia

U.N. – for fear of R. diffies causing delays. Speed is of the

essence. 3) If we rely on this as basis, we shdn’t weaken

fr. A. If we weaken on a/c of that even greater resentment

of J.

H.D. Favour this scheme. Financially v. satisf.

Apart fr. troops our fin. commitmt. likely to be limited to recurrent

Arab deficit. All the capital schemes otherwise catered for.

With Intern. Bank &amp; Jordan Valley Scheme it shd. become

self-supporting area.

H.M. A good scheme.

E.B. x/ Para. 16. Look again at ques. of widening Council to cover Jew &amp;

Moslem places as well. And communicate with U.S.

P.M. Prepare draft statement.

E.B. Say – we accept in principle: we must make statement next week:

F.O. to State Dept.

want it identical: preparing draft &amp; will send it at end/week.

H.M. Statement at outset of Debate. P.M. to make it.

G.H. to open second day &amp; E.B. to wind up.

After discussion: agreed P.M. to open: 2nd day E.B. to open &amp;

G.H. to conclude.

E.B. Send report to Doms. &amp; Col. for offers under 6(c). Get them in before

Debate.

G.H. No room in Colonies – been thro’ it all. Tropical countries.

R.S.C. Communicate substance to J. &amp; A. before announcement. Agreed. [Enter C.I.G.S.

Palestine – Immediate Situation. P.M. Read commn from Arab Higher Cttee.

Irgun have admitted responsibility. Known tht. perpetrators came

G.H. Total casualties – as in Press. incldg. 50-60 Arabs.

from Tel-a-viv. H.C. considerg. possibility of search for

301

terrorists in Tel-a-viv particularly. Wd. take 2 Divns. Politically

wider than search for Hagana arms. 2 wks. prepns. Examining plans.

Need for striking action to prevent A. takg. law into own hands

&amp; bolter B. morale. Suggest a) stopping immigrn.

b) sequestrating funds. On b) imposn of large fine. Read remainder of telegram.

P.M. a) Searches for terrorists in Tel-a-viv etc., is directed to outrage.

b) Sequestrn of funds is futile because it hits all Jews. c) Immigration cd. be considered – tho’ U.S. views.

Agreed don’t do this because reaction on suffering Jews

Recommend a) and not general search for Hagana arms. Reject b) Agreed.

There are known

C.I.G.S. Enough troops in M/E. so long as J. alone are resisting. Arms dumps. We wd. like to seize them &amp; act

v. terrorists. Ample troops in Pal. for that. Wd. not involve

w’spread searches.

P.M. Action v. Irgun: not v. Hagana.

J. Collect known arms dumps also.

A.B. Don’t upset Jews when on eve of settlement.

Agreed: immediate action to root out Irgun &amp; round up known

arms dumps to extent they cd. be used by Irgun i.e. avoid impn of striking at Hagana.

P.M. Put that to H. Commr. Stern gang to be included. }

C.I.G.S. Wd. be done w’out

A.V.A. Need to screen immigrants – for security reasons.

G.H. Practical difficulty.

Noted: action won’t start for a week i.e. after the debate.

R.S.C. Cd. you outlaw members of Irgun? } To get

} “drama”

E.Sh. If this encounters wholesale resistance, is it war? large-scale opns all over Palestine. Only “war” if

they came out to battle. [Enter J.B.H.

3. Civil Aviation Bill.

A. Divn. will be forced to-day – on posn of subordinate Scottish company

of B.O.A.C. 302

S. of S. Scotland thinks no objn to it.

The reduced proposal will be pressed. My instinct is not to divide v. it;

accept it.

That was accepted by Scott. members of H/C.

Bad to give way to H/Lds. on this.

4. Germany: Results of Paris Discussions.

for it will be carried v. us.

A.G. Doesn’t affect principle of Bill – nd. help to conciliate Sc. opinion –

R.S.C. Will it be internal to Scotland only?

J. Internal &amp; such other rights as may be given fr. time to time by

B.O.A.C.

H.M. Was considered in H/C. Sc. Divn. of BOAC., with Sr. manager &amp;

Sc. advisory cttee.

That was enough, surely. Of all the services on wh. to admit domestic

organisation, civil aviation is the worst.

Concede the principle on an economic issue, &amp; where do you get to –

e.g. on electricity &amp; other G.B. jurisdictions.

J. The Minister is v. much opposed to it – as is his Chairman.

Agreed: resist amendment.

longer but produce better results in the end. Believe it might

E.B. Considered posn as result of Paris mtg. Not practicable for us to make

our own Zone self-supporting. Union with U.S. Zone will take

reduce our expenditure from £80 m. to £25 m. – in 12 months

after merger.

Cd. draw timber &amp; other useful supplies from U.S. Zone.

But means tht. U.K. &amp; U.S. will be forced into independent revision

Danger of dividing Europe in 2. But R. fear of efficient U.K.-U.S.

Scheme won’t become operative until Fr. &amp; R. have seen it &amp; said

Seek approval therefore for Recommns 1-3.

of level of industry in 2 Zones.

Zones may be more effective than argument. We have tried for

agreement – over 12 months.

wtr. they will come in.

Re recommn 4. Are publishing our record in B. zone which, on the

whole, does us credit. As against this, evce tht. R. are makg. munitions in G. &amp; exporting them to R.

Therefore recommn 4 shd. be put into opern – at suitable moment,

R.S.C. Care in using App. C. – because of compromising sources.

P.M. Para. 2 of J.I.C. covering note.

not now.

303

E.B. Don’t propose to publish App. C. as it stands.

[Exit. H.M.

5. Marriages between B. Servicemen and Foreign Women.

A.V.A. Does this plan involve abandoning idea of socialising industries in

B. zone.

E.B. We will go on with that - &amp; U.S. won’t interfere.

E.Sh. Who will conduct negotns with U.S.? Our people in G. don’t

understand economic ques.

E.B. Experts (economic) fr. U.K. must go out to advise Control Commn.

H.D. Want Ty. Repves there.

Agreed F.O. may communicate to State Dpt.

[Enter. de Freitas.

C.I.G.S. When we lifted non-fraternisation, I suggd ban on marriages shd. hold.

home.

C.E. He can marry now

G. women, expectg. trouble in winter, are trying to marry B. soldiers in

order to get B. nationty.

I wd. prefer tht. soldier shd. not be allowed to marry until he gets

J.J.L. Pregnancy cases. They get permn.

C.I.G.S. V. few.

when he gets home. That involves no change.

We were told permn is given in pregnancy cases. That is an easy way

to dodge the ban. At Party mtg. suggd affiliation procdgs. in G. shd. be made binding on

man when he comes home. Many cases here of girls who can’t

If we do maintain the ban, we shd. have no pregnancy let-out.

enforce v. U.S. and Can. soldiers who have left.

J.J.L. Marriage if contracted is valid – in spite of the ban.

Once that is generally known, you cdn’t go on imposing discipl.

penalties.

P.M. Can it be effective? You encourage clandestine marriages: you put a

premium on “anticipn” of marriage.

J.B.H. Also – no control over (increasing no. of) civilians.

J. If you exempt for pregnancy, it’s an invitation to immorality.

C.I.G.S. If Cab. decide this way, we can urge men to wait until after a leave

home.

304

(in reply to A.B.)

Memo. approved: subject to adminve safeguards.

[Exit C.I.G.S.

de Freitas.

6. Rhodesian Railways.

A. As in memo.

Colour bar – in S. Rhodesia, tho’ not in N. Rhodesia or

Bechuanaland. Due v. largely to the local Labour Party.

Hopeless to expect the 3 Govts. to make a sensible arrangement. But co. are entitled to know where they are. We recommend that co.

be allowed to go ahead: &amp; I send out to S. Rhodesian Govt.

own rlways.

statement that we aren’t going to nationalise for 10 years.

Reason: natn is not practicable.

G.H. I support this.

H.D. My officials concurred. I find it diff., however, to agree to this

anti-Socialist declaration being issued on eve of nationalising

Alternatives: a) cd. S. Rhodesian section of rlways. be worked by

nationalised S. African rlways.

R.S.C. For £25 m., is 10 years a long enough period of security.

A. Driven to this unwelcome concln by the facts.

S. Rhod. Govt. press us for proposals. Don’t make any themselves.

P.M. They shd. put up a proposal.

Agreed: C/Exch. to consult with D.O. and C.O.

[Enter G. Tomlinson M/Supply.

7. Timber for Housing.

A.B. Facts as in memo.

Need for greater supplies from Germany. Espec. as it can be secured all year round whereas R. ports wd. be closed.

P.M. Had full discn in O.R.C. on this. Can’t go over all of it again.

But can J.B.H. report further?

J.B.H. Been over to see Lenanton. Food &amp; man-power are bottle-necks.

For latter we must have skilled supervisors e.g. from Italy,

Newfoundland etc.

Not satisfied tht. Lenanton group has bn. sufficiently active.

P.M. Told before tht. Lenanton was v. good.

305

E.Sh. He is a good man. Get him over here before O.R.C. &amp; let him speak

for himself.

P.M. All can’t be well if so obvious a thing as supervisory labour has been

the red tape: &amp; now he isn’t getting their support when he

No bottle-neck at Hamburg now.

Agreed: Get Lenanton &amp; Head of Econ. Mission over to U.K.

J.W. Tractors: use Army tractors already in Germany.

overlooked.

J.B.H. Lack of liaison is prob. the trouble. Lenanton given a free hand to cut

needs it.

Lenanton acting directly under B/Trade. Failure of liaison.

R.S.C. Anyway will be acute shortage of timber, this year and next.

25.000 stand fr. Russia by autumn, I hope: then no more until June.

Might get 40.000 st. fr. Finland in return for iron &amp; steel.

Importance of timber for exports: crating. Every alternative to

use of timber shd. be exploited.

Only ultimate solution = Russia.

E.Sh. Timber for Sweden – v. coal wh. is now going to France.

N.B. 20.000 (or 10.000 – JBH) available in Austria.
