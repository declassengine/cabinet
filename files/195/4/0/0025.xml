C.M. 37 (46) 24th April, 1946

1. Egypt

P.M. If we insist, riots – U.N.O. - disaster. If we offer at once complete w’drawal

in 5 yrs., Egypt may feel diff. m’while &amp; we can make some

arrangemts.

A.B. E. wd. understand physically imposs. to complete in less than 5 yrs. - &amp; wd.

issue agreed statement? Wdn’t be able to represent it as delaying

tactics?

2. World Food Supplies

Defence Cttee considered – favoured second course.

J. Position in country where unwelcome is posn of weakness.

P.M. Yes: 18 mos. – 5 years.

Agreed – offer complete w’drawal.

B.S. As in memo.

E.Sh. If Can. estimates are even approx. correct, we shan’t be short at all.

B.S. Yes: For we need 400.000 t a month. Total shortfall over period – 600.000t.

P.M. What will be our stocks at end/June on Massey’s figures?

B.S. Cdn’t say, I wd. guess about 775.000 + 300.000 T. flour. or 1105,000 t. in

all. July-Sept.

P.M. Home supplies then. And U.S. will under write 85.000 for June + 286.000

for July = 371.000 tons.

B.S. No: U.S. undertakg. is to make good 300.000 odd shortfall.

P.M. Put it in terms of supplies not shortfall.

In Aug. 114.000 t. fr. Canada + 150.000 fr. home supplies.

Results in stock of 796.000 t. at end of September.

Wd. there be shop shortages with a stock of 796.000?

B.S. Yes.

From Can. totals 278.000 t.

At end of June stocks at 1.105.000 tons. Consumption 418.000 t. p. month.

In Sept. 50,000 t. fr. Canada + 150.000 fr. home supplies.

By then, shipments from N. America will be beginning.

144

E.B. There shd. be a census of stocks.

B.S. 100.000 t. but used daily.

B.S. 675.000 – 700.000 in peace: but ready replenishment.

P.M. This is running it v. close e.g. if late harvest you wd. not keep stocks as high.

Thus, there is a case for considering introdn of economics now. Also

because we have promised U.S. to take comparable action.

A.B. For what reason - to match U.S. or to meet stock posn.

P.M. Mainly the second.

T.W. Anyhow avoid long-term damages. 21/2% increase in extractn rate means

heavy loss of animal feed. Doubtful wisdom to do that.

P.M. Smaller loaf. 10.000 t. p. month}

Beer 10.000 t. p month}

B.S. Saving in these 3 = 137.000 t to end/Sept. Extractn rate 21/2 wd. yield the

same. Beer cut wd. lose 40.000 t of brewers’ grains.

A.B. Our med. advisers say no harm in going to 871/2% - tho’ I agree with T.W. re

P.M. Minimum stock in peace?

Distilling 10.000 t. p. month} Total savings perhaps 32.000 t. p. month

agric. arguemts. against.

E.B. Think it wd. be enough to do smaller loaf at this stage. That can be

represented as 121/2% cut. Enough to match U.S. economics.

J. Why not do biscuits also?

E.B. Can’t turn on to any other food in U.K.

P.M. Case for cutting beer – do that + smaller loaf. Beer is 28% up on pre-war:

G.H. H.D. is ready to lose the revenue – from beer or whisky proposals.

Agreed:

Consider other economics later.

P.M. Doubt if we shd. stop there.

but (B.S.) the 28% is water.

E.B. Then cut it by 10% only , not 20%.

Introduce 13/41b loaf at 41/2d.

Cut beer production to 90% of pre-war.

145

A.B. If you aren’t raising extractions rate don’t need barley – needn’t do the

distilling cut.

P.M. May get something out of Services.

T.W. Cut in beer – poss. because men out of Forces &amp; munitions.

Stop bread with main meals – whr. on demand or not.

Agreed.

E.B. Census of stocks.

A. S. Africa 10,000 t. not up to 10,000 t.

P.M. Situation in India is desperate.

G.H. And Malaya &amp; H. Kong. Another 10,000.

P.M. We shd. stress India’s needs. On distribution of the 200,000 t.

B.S. Surplus of potatoes likely. Inclined to deal with Belgium re. maize, barley

&amp; rye. 80.000 t. of potatoes against animal food.

T.W. Agreed.

E.Sh. What about Ruhr – coal output. Will have to consider them.

B.S. May still have some left for Germany.

E.Sh. Reactions on France &amp; Holland of reduced coal output in Ruhr.

If any deal with Belgium, shd. be for benefit of starving countries e.g. in

S.E.A. or India – not for benefit of U.K.

P.M. Statement on food cuts. Thursday, after consultn with Fr. Williams.

Consider Germany’s needs before deciding disposal of this potato surplus.

E.B. Coal output dropped by 25% - effect on C/E.

P.M. Why not get them to use their maize surplus for starch?

B.S. That’s what I mean.

Van Moor cd. give us 50.000 t. of copra in last 3 mos. But re. textiles: 3-4m. yds. &amp; balances in sterling re 10.000 t. of copra. Can we compel manufrs. to meet that order.

P.M. Take it up with B/T.

E.B. At Mancher. trade assured me they wd. do what they were told.

Pointing out what we’ve done already.

146

E.B. Put extn rate as percentage over pre war – i.e. from 73% to 85%.

[Exit B.S.

3. Trusteeship

A. Urgent because of impending visit of Smuts. As in memo.

Part A. of Memo. No disagreement.

- Agreed. Favour supporting Smuts – openly.

P.M. Annexation or after consultn with inhabitants.

A. He will say popn want incorpn. The white popn do. How can he determine

what natives want? How cd. you consult them? The Chiefs say they

want incorpn.

P.M. This is the point wh. will be taken at U.N.O. S. African treatment of blacks

is not popular.

A. Smuts will be ready to give assurance that we will consult wishes of the

inhabitants.

T.W. What do S. African Labour Party think of this?

A. More inclined to support Smuts now than before. But what does that Party

stand for? [Condn of natives in S. Rhodesia: &amp; neither section of Labour

Party there offered any protest.]

E.Sh. Cdn’t we support, subject to consent of natives being sought by means

Smuts hasn’t yet agreed to our placing our own mandates under trusteeship.

We took initiative in announcing that. Well received - &amp; Austr. &amp;

N.Z. &amp; Belgium followed our lead. And S. African attitude criticised

then. We found diffy. in inducg. Fr. to come into line. Can’t press

them if we support Smuts in this.

J. Why shdn’t you agree on condns at x/.?

E.B. May involve split in Commonwealth front. We’ve got to say in Trusteeship

Council which side we are on. Can’t take G.H.’s line.

Part. B of Memo. German S.W. Africa. Traded for 20 yrs. as part of Union, tho’ under mandate. Popn 350,000 incldg. 30,000 white.

Do we support Smuts’ attempt to incorporate in Union?

x/ acceptable to U.N.O. Para 7 (c) is not good enough.

G.H. Will put Col. Empire in diffy. if we openly support Smuts.

Para. 6 of my memo. is furthest we shd. go.

147

Smuts will be here on Monday. Why not discuss this with him? A.

y./ no further than x/ in any event.

G.H. Even that will give rise to trouble in Colonies because of S. African attitude

to natives.

G.H. But we don’t want to seem to countenance that.

P.M. S. Africa was given the mandate. We can’t say it shd. be ours.

Agreed as at y/.

Must ventilate it 1st inter nos.

E.B. What is to stop U.S., Russia or anyone annexing territory if we countenance that.

Esh. He is to argue his case at U.N.O. and also x/. This isn’t annexation. S. Africa is spreading out – how prevent them from seeking means to extend territory. Means. Surely thro’ U.N.O. + x/ is safest means.

G.H. Want it discussed at D.P.M.

P.M. Of course: but what is our line to be? Hear how the discussion goes: go

E.Sh. Not a bad thing to have ventilated in U.N.O. the S. African attitude to natives.

4. Palestine Need for report to be studied before decision reached.

High power Cttee apptd by P.M. wd. study this with C.O.S.

E.B. Report of Commn recd. They’ve accepted further 100,000 J. immigration – tho’ in later chapters they condemn Jewish activities.

U.S. pressure for immed. publn of Ch. I. of rpt. Protested to U.S. re. this.

My first re-action – we can’t as mandatory Power carry out this rpt. unless illegal armies cleared up &amp; a new deal with J. Agency. Then I wd. accept 100.000 subject to Bd. of Control on wh. U.S. represented. Also can’t undertake cost of bldg up Arabs: U.S. or Arabs must find the cash.
