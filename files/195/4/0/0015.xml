C.M. 27(46). 25th March, 1946.

1. Persia. dodge S. Council &amp; m’while get oil concession &amp; the kind of

be change of policy – rpt. this a.m. of w’drawal from

2. Greece.

E.B. No def. informn beyond public radio announcement – unless anythg.

unforeseen occurs is a big loophole. Can’t tell wtr. it’s a ruse to

P. Govt. they want. Can’t therefore advise Cabinet on this. May

Manchuria.

E.Sh. Oil concessions. Rpt. going to F.O. to-day: copy to P.M. to decide

wtr. to circulate to Cab.

E.B. Stood my ground. Rpts suggest condns as good as you can expect

World opinion turng. twds. me.

3. Spain.

for such a country.

Wd. like some vocal support fr. Labour Party.

P.M. Rally to Party Mtg. Wed.

E.B. I’m as anxious as Labour hot-heads to get Franco out. But so much

Franco.

trouble elsewhere tht. I can’t advice Cab. to go too fast with

4. Egypt. Will see P.M. re

E.B. Moving out will put fat in fire. Better to wait &amp; make 2 moves. effect on Defence Cttee.

5. U.S. Bases. A.B. Suggn in wk.-end Press tht. R. wd. raise Iceland issue as against U.S.

on S. Council.

What wd. our attitude be?

E.B. Commd on that. Warned Byrnes tht. this situation wd. arise both on

Iceland &amp; Azores. Need really is civil aviation – no need for

bases. R.N. hadn’t many bases when it policed the world. If

U.S. goes on claiming so many bases R. is bound to do the same,

unilaterally. e.g. Spitzbergen, even Faroes. Advised Byrnes as

93

lease expired June to ask for 12 months’ extension &amp; give time for UNO. to handle it. He refused this. All I’ve done is to claim

Hope I’ve dissuaded U.S. fr. askg. for base in Azores. I propose it be a

rights in one of the 2 airfields. Bound to provoke R. if U.S. took

Conflict in U.S. betwn. War Dpts &amp; State Dpt.

right for aircraft to use these bases: but I’ve refrained from askg.

for any B. bases.

free for all civil avn base. Have promised B. support for that

scheme – on basis of “free post”. U.S. now want exclusive

one &amp; we the other.

Doubt if Salagar will yield to that U.S. request.

Iceland: warned Byrnes tht. I. Govt. wd. lose election if it yielded

to U.S. request.

6. World Food Supplies.

P.M. Complained again about conference held by P.R.O. M/Food.

B.S. Arrival in W’ton delayed. Cereals &amp; rice Cttees were examg. deficits

&amp; rice.

India – definite antipathy in U.S.

Rice – 567.000 deficit uncovered. U.S. tried to reduce India to

with no hope of reachg. agreemt. Supply &amp; demand for wheat

Prelim. talk with Cl. Anderson – helpful.

CFB. met 14/3. – full meeting. Succeeded in maintaing. U.K. figure.

Ex. en. countries to 1.000 cal. level.

France – took a/c of R. offer.

900.000. I got Cl. A. to accept my figures as workg. basis.

Final allocn to India 150. vice 200.000. Reasonable quantities for other L.F.C. countries. But need to

Reason: Fear of dust-bowl condns.

No hope of their re-introducg. rationing.

N. Guinea, Sumatra &amp; W. Africa.

Some tempy redn in U.K. consumptn seems inevitable largely

get supplies fr. Siam.

U.S. acreage: no hope of further increase above 1 m. wheat:

1 m. soya: 1 m. corn.

Ditto in Canada.

Believe, however, some increase in Can. &amp; U.S.

India: I got 140.000 &amp; 170.000 rice. Problem now = get enough

in time.

Indians v. displeased.

Will circulate full report.

U.S. doing best to reduce consumption wheat 40% oils &amp; fats 20%.

Oils &amp; fats – discn at offl. level. Thought it unwise to approach

Ministers at this stage: wd. antagonise officials. U.S.

consumptn is being reviewed. They press us to get supplies fr.

N. Guinea = Austr. mandate; &amp; Austr. usg. supplies for own

soap &amp; marg. manuf. 94

because the Indian ground-nut decn – wh. I will discuss with

Indians on L.F.C. to-morrow.

Visit successful on the whole. But U.S. are tiring of our continuous

appeals.

riots in India. Cd. we press them to do so when Cab. Mission

P.M. Thought they weren’t short of this sort of food.

Wd. be wise to lay off now.

P.M. Details of W.F.S. mtg.

Consider now – debates, b’casts etc.

A.B. Ground-nuts. Exporter told me he was refusing to export because

arrives.

B.S. Trying to make ghee of it – I believe ground nuts wd. go thro’ them.

A.B. Large nos. of poor Indians do eat ground-nuts.

with the wheat &amp; rice allocns they’ve now got.

U.S. have a man there. Wd. like Marris to go: also

Thorn (wheat).

E.B. Suggd Friday co-ordination of B. agencies there thro’ B. Embassy.

P.M. B’cast?

B.S. After debate in H/Commons.

P.M. Yes: will consider it then.

E.B. Are we talking too much re

B.S. I’ve bought ½ m. tons &amp; can’t get them. Believe they can export them,

H.M. Debate. White Paper: if it cd. be appd to-morrow, we cd. have debate

next week. Cd. hold House until week after next. Mon. week

wd be about the latest.

T.W. Wd. it be wise to publish W. Paper before EECE mtg.

P.M. Can’t consider that to-day.

H.M. Must decide at W.F.S. mtg. Tuesd.

B.S. Mission to Argentine: 3 men (genl. supplies: cereals, wheat: meat).

food? Annoying to housewives.

H.M. Reasons a) diff. times ahead: need to warn them re background.

[Exit B.S.

b) peoples of the world shd. know the facts, so they can

judge their duty, e.g. in U.S. &amp; Canada.

7. Security Council: Use of Veto. R. have put in amendmts. wh. we haven’t had time to consider.

J. Real point = does a controversy come under Chap. 6 or 7.

But Ch. 6 deals with both disputes and

E.B. Attempt to clarify – “dispute” “situation” ques.

situations.

Real need is to clear d. or s. under Ch. 6. and a threat under

E.B. I wanted a simpler approach – dispute if originating Govt. wished it

Others disagreed.

paid to…….

accept the [substance] principle.

J. Save for Art. 34 – wh. because in Ch. 6 – does raise a point of

the principle.

Ch. 7. (Art. 39).

By this definition you don’t meet the real point.

so treated.

J. In deciding wtr. a ques. is to be treated under Ch. 6 or 7, regard be

E.B. Ready to accept views of F.O. lawyers &amp; J. on method: if Cab.

principle. That is both d. &amp; s.

E.B. But in addn to Charter there is the 4 Power Interpretn – which is worse.
