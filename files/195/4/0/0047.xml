C.M. 61 (46) 24th June, 1946

1. Persia

N.B. Strong repns to P.M. tht. we hold him respons. for B. lives &amp; property. This has made impn on him.

Has sent Director to receive complts. vice going to Tudeh Party.

M. Berthond has gone out – will send to E.Sh. copy of his directive.

Signs of some improvemts. tribes hostile to Tudeh Party.

E.Sh. Tudeh has strong hold – labour agitn canalised thro’ them.

N.B. That is E.B.’s policy. Also hopes for formn of T.H.: &amp; Persians show signs of wanting our help with that.

2. Council of Foreign Ministers: Paris

N.B. Going better than we feared. Shd. know by Fri. what hopes of agreemt. Apart fr. Repns main crux – Trieste. Some signs tht. R. wd. accept internat. regime &amp; tht. Fr. will put it up. Diffy. may be to find an Ital. Govt. which wd. accept it.

Repns. Sov. claim is being reduced to £10M: but involves principle of current prodn. Danger = repercussions on Germany when it wd. be important.

G.H. Malta. Rpt. on cost of rehabiln recd: estimate over £40M. If repn claimed, don’t forget Malta. We have given or promised £30M &amp; that won’t be enough.

N.B. We agreed last Aug. tht. we shdn’t demand repns from Italy.

3. Palestine

G.H. 2 of kidnapped offrs. released. Seems tht. other 3 will be retained pro. tem.

P.M. Pep. to-morrow.

J. Anders addressg. P. troops in Pal. – saying workg. for new Poland, includg. Lwow.

Surely we shdn’t allow him to go.

J.J.L. Don’t know anything.

P.M. Find out. Also what he actually said.

G.H. I wasn’t told he was going.

N.B. Our Genls. don’t make such speeches. Why sh. he? 252

Anglo. Am. discns: progress reported.

No rprt. to Govts. at this stage. Only report to main party.

x Telgr. to go to W’ton urging early arrival of Grady. x.

4. Canada: Long-term Wheat Agreement.

H.D. State Dpt. concerned about re-action on Loan. M/F. was apprehensive: was expectg. Clayton to press him to delay announcement. I thght. tht. wd. be embarrassing: send him some gen re Clayton (doctrinaire re bulk purchase).

Reply from M/F now coming in: can consider in light of tht. whr. we need hold up announcement.

A.B. Argentine wheat. Can we have def. report?

P.M. I will ask for rpt. from M/Food.

5. United Somalia

T.W. Any confirmn of RSH’s allegns of purchase of linseed oil by Russia.

N.B. I will enquire.

A.

Don’t discuss intern. trusteeship in Africa until we know what form

intern. trust will take. Don’t be commd to agreemt. in advance to

intern. principle.

G.H. Purpose = keep it open. Did E.B. mean w’drawg. B. trusteeship only or w’drawg. whole proposal. If the first, don’t mind so much: if the second, must ask for review.

N.B. Diffies with Ethiopian (Ogaden) – diffies over B. trusteeship claim. E.B. concluded it was more trouble than it was worth. And he meant “that’s out”. viz., tht. in further discns we wdn’t raise again the ques. of United Somalia.

Further point: deal with Ethiopia for grazing land against camel corridor.

F.O. favour that.

But what E.B. has said needn’t exclude takg. up later idea of United Somalia under international trusteeship.

P.M. Cd. understand w’drawg. it fr. discn. See no reason to abandon it w’out quid pro quo.

Agreed. Wider implicns. Wd. be unfortunate to abandon whole idea.

H.D. Suspended for 12 mos. Somalia is least attractive part of Africa, fr. financial pt. of view. Cost of administrating this desert.

253

P.M. Must look at our posn in area as a whole. Send message to E.B. saying – Noted w’drawn. Assumes this means no decision: held over 12 months.

N.B. Para. 2 of Tel. 233. Can we say B trust w’drawn?

P.M. No. Wd. prefer p’ponement.

i.e. horse w’drawn fr. these tasks.

6. Basic English.

P.M. Whose vote?

N.B. F.O. vote: and don’t like defending it.

Favour giving some support to this.

H.D. Support this.

Personal &amp; financial factors are v. difficult.

But Ogden prefers Ty. to F.O. officials!

Can I explore it. Then M/Ed. can look into it with me now.

J. &amp; A.B. Spoke in favour of B. English.

[Enter H.M.

N.B. Three uses

b) entry into English

c)

A.B. F.O. shdn’t handle this.

C.E. International use – commercial jargon. And on that a/c, if no other, not useful as introdn to wider learning of English.

If we aren’t too ambitious, this wd. be useful w’in limits.

P.M. Who then shd. look after it? Not B. Council nor F.O. Better suited to B/T

H.M. or C.O.I.?

Generally agreed: no ques. of B. Council.

a) commercial code.

auxil. internatl language

F.O. object to (c) [&amp; aren’t concerned with a) or b)]: for various reasons.

Agree for these reasons F.O. wrong Dpt. to handle it. Wd. welcome its being taken up – a) and b) – by someone else.

P.M. Begin on trading side.

254

A.B. Get it in on lower levels: high-ups have taken trouble to learn English.

Agree: official use (take copyright)

let H.M. with Ty. &amp; others consider how to exploit.

[Exit O. Sargent

7.

[Enter Barnes

Coal: Five-Day Week E.Sh. Explained posn. Drew attention to form of announcement.

b) better atmosphere in industry

c)

Read letter from N.U.M. They say over 6 months another 71/2 cwt. per man per week wd. result from 5 day week.

Other advantages

a) wd. stimulate recruitment

with the condns attd wd. increase prodn.

I’m satisfied tht. w’out somethg. like this we can’t improve posn.

Reid Cttee recommded 5 day wk. with 8 hrs. day. But Reid has since admitted to me tht. with condns I propose 8 hour day not essential.

Other demands in Charter (i) 2 wks with pay vice 1. (ii) paymt. for 6 stat. hols.

Propose to reject (i) but accept (ii).

Date of opern. Divn of views. among miners leaders. Some wd. be content with 1/1/47 (resting date): others want autumn 1946. But most responsible men wd. be content with May ’47 – at end of current coal year. This would get us thro’ winter. Also wd. give N.C.B. time to settle details. Further point:

P.M. Diff. to suggest Govt. isn’t responsible. We are nationalising the industry &amp;

apptg. the Bd. which will negotiate.

a) Repercussions. Particularly if applied to surface workers. Prob. demand fr. agric. We’ve looked at this point. Cdn’t differentiate – cdn’t get it thro’ N.U.M.: cdn’t work it in practice anyway. It wd. mean reducing pay of some surface workers.

b) Parly. announcement simultaneously with Bridlington. Have considered &amp; written to L.P.

T.W. Fr. pt. view repercussions on agric., most important to avoid giving imprn tht. this is Govt. decision. – either that or direct Govt. intervention betwn. employers &amp; min.

cf. L.P. decision – wording. Para. 5 of draft statement differs from that - &amp; seems to imply Govt. responsibility for this concession. cf. also “at my request” on 2nd page.

This looks like thin edge of wedge of Govt. intervention in wages &amp; condns.

A.B. And nationn must be made to mean something to the miner. We want to make it clear to miner that Govt. is author of this.

But we must get time to re-arrange in pits to avoid disastrous drop in output.

255

Traffic is bottle-neck: &amp; shorter working week makes it worse.

Sympathise with M/Ag. re surface worker. The differential betwn. him &amp; underground worker is too small. You shd. take liberty to use surface workers on 6th day if required w’out overtime.

Don’t entrust publicity (for conditions) to miners’ leaders.

Barnes. Don’t see a case for 5-day wk. for surface workers – more than cf. for transport workers.

Haven’t bn. satisfied tht. coal can be cleared fr. the mines with 5 day week.

We shd. have time to go into this before being commd. Traffic has always bn. a bottle-neck &amp; this will make it worse.

H.M. B/T. take serious view. Grave risk of reduced output &amp; increased cost (wh.

is already too high &amp; is a grave liability to B. industry). Our advantage

expected fr. natn was reduced price.

This means in effect a 1/6th increase of wages. If it leads to increased output &amp; lower costs, these arguments are invalidated.

L.P. Cttee discussed &amp; recommend the scheme on balance –

Some force majeure because reason to expect strikes etc., w’out this concession.

E.Sh. assures us he will get quid pro quo by way of conditions.

On ques. whr. Govt. shd. father decision: pity we can’t do it via industry, but M. Assocn. will be out before details settled, and N.C.B. won’t be in. : we agreed therefore to formula.

But we all think even this degree of Govt. intervention is undesirable.

Mining has bn. too much in politics. They sh. be told why this happened this time &amp; warned they will have to deal with N.C.B. in future.

Repercussions. Real case = nature of workers job. This doesn’t apply to surface worker: &amp; there is danger of repercussion. Again, we want to up-grade surface worker to face-work: &amp; mustn’t therefore reduce the differential. I wish this cd. be met.

Announcement.

a) risk tht. will be said E.Sh. gave way (b’mailed) to N.U.M.

b) this will have gt. econ. consequences good or bad. And Govt. are responsible for it.

They will want a debate. Maybe a Vote of Censure.

Unless Parlt. is treated equal footing with N.U.M. there will be trouble.

Agreed: M/F &amp; P. to make statement in H/C. on previous day.

G.A.I. “See no objn” vice “favour”. in the statement. a) Costs. If this leads to 5 days work, we’re O.K. because only work

now 41/2

.

E.Sh. Replied to points raised in discn

If he doesn’t work 5 days he doesn’t get 6 day pay.

There is an element of risk.

256

b)

I could

Surface workers. If this isn’t Govt. decision, it’s for industry to settle that. drop a hint at Bridlington. I can’t be firm because don’t believe its

practicable.

Problem isn’t serious, however. They are disappearing gradually: &amp; we will have none save compensn cases.

c) Transport. True you can’t work on Sats. under this scheme. But you can’t do much now: for there is 60-70% absentee-ism on Sats. And you need Sat &amp; Sun for repair &amp; maintenance work.

P.M. Govt. intervention point is not v. strong. For hours have for years past been regulated by the State.

E.Sh. May I amplify para 3.?

Agreed.

Agreed: as above: simult. statement in H/Lords [Exit Barnes

Agreed: special Cab. mtg. for other points.

4.

(Contd). Canada: Long-term Wheat Agreement.

H.D. Clayton said cdn’t defend this if challenged on Loan. Thght. 5/7 latest: maybe next week.

M/F thinks in these circs. better to p’pone. Want to know if he shd. try to persuade Canadian Govt. accordingly.

No alternatives therefore but to p’pone.

A.B. But v. sinister.
