3 wrecking amendmts.

Salaries of doctors – eliminatg. possibility of remuneration by salary. treatment of deaf: nonsense to particularise

in machinery Bill.

Bound therefore to resist these three amendments.

A. Cranb. expects a) &amp; b) to be thrown out by H/Commons.

On c) point is protn of public from quack remedies. To be taken to-day. There will be some fuss &amp; it may be carried v. us.

4. Mining of Destroyers in Corfu Channel.

[Enter C.O.S., G.H., F.B., de Fritas, J.W.

Consultns with F.O. not complete.

C.N.S. Intern. w’way joining 2 seas: legal posn is clear, even tho’ less than 3 miles

wide.

G.H. Read from brief.

Important for small craft: we have habitually used it.

Swept originally early in ’44 – to clear known mine-fields, it follows closely Albanian coast. Intern. Mini Clearance Bd. issues periodically

380

Med. Route Instns and a chart, giving details of channel: 20 copies go to Alb. Govt. who have had many earlier opporties of raising objn.

No proof Albanians laid the mines. By Fr. statement to U.N. looks as tho’ they did. If we recover a mine on sweeping, we get proof.

A.B. Why shd. we sweep it alone if other Govts. agree.

C.N.S. C-in-C Med. has a force together. We told him not to use G.K. sweepers

because of the tension.

Discussion suspended – for F.O. views to be obtained.

5. National Service. b) care required in selection of Apprentices and Students.

P.M. Record decision that Bill shd. not apply to N. Ireland.

Agreed.

C.P. (46) 380 Para. 8.

P.M. a) discussed already. G.A.I. We have put in hand arrangements to test tht. apprenticeship is bona fide.

C.E. Need to ensure they start to learn at outset – will shorten apprenticeship.

G.A.I. Can get co-opn thro’ Joint Adv. Council (new).

P.M. Will need a tight system in Bill.

G.A.I. Average period now 5 yrs. May get it down to 4.

E.W. M/Ed. want to be associated with schemes for youngsters in Services. }

P.M. Not relevant here: but shd. be taken up &amp; referred higher (?A.V.A.) if } diffies. }

A. 7 years goes v. high. Cd. it be reduced?

R.S.C. Med. Students.

G.A.I. 21 industrial: 25 students?

P.M. Politically v. dangerous.

A.B. Have we decided on 11/2 vice 1 year? The extra 1/2 year will increase controversy.

That is where the effective criticism will come.

381

H.D. Flexible &amp; defensible. Carry on at 11/2 as now, with power to reduce when

circs. warrant it.

Agreed 11/2 years.

P.M. Criticism anyhow. Criterion shd. be efficiency. We concluded 11/2 necessary to get an effective system.

(c) Refresher Training C.A.S. Tradesmen workg. in their trades in Civil life needn’t be called up for as

long as air-crew.

P.M. This means you can’t calculate loss to prodn.

Accept principle of refresher training = &amp; flexibility. Work

R.S.C. Shd. be shorter period.

P.M. 3 weeks: &amp; not necessarily every year, part soon after original service

E.Sh. Flexibility on time or season e.g. miners &amp; farmers.

F.B. Cd. be adjusted. Liaison with civil Dpts.

A.B. This on top of holidays will involve services w’drawal from prodn.

R.S.C. 50.000 man years is my estimate.

A.V.A. Won’t begin to be effective until 1952.

out detailed scheme. Perhaps Maximum over the 51/2 years.

(d) Medically Unfit. G.A.I. Easier to omit Grade III: but thought Def. Cttee wanted to include as many

as possible.

P.M. On M/L memo. - how do you select from Grade III?

G.A.I. Obligation if services can use the man.

R.S.C. But how choose between Jones &amp; Smith?

P.M. Total exemptn based on failure to employ in Services.

382

A.B. Advantages of incldg III – avoids getting cream into Services.

P.M. Why add some we never called up in war.

Agreed: call up only Grades I &amp; II. Make II easier.

(e) Conscientious Objectors.

P.M. Can’t let a c.o. stay in own job, even if its agriculture. Must go to another job.

Can’t, of 2, take one &amp; have another.

R.S.C. Don’t exclude that

A.V.A. Goes: can you make it tighter than in war.

R.S.C. No: leave it as now – its well understood.

P.M. Disagreed: not same as in war. Can’t in peace have him in same job.

possibility. Leave discretion to Tribunal. Or put him

subject to M/L direction.

A.B. Must move the c.o. from his own job – even if you left him in own craft.

H.D. Power of M/L direction shd. cover it.

P.M. Will be kept in mind.

P.M. No conscription for women.

H.M. W. Paper either now (for talk on Address) or on introdn of Bill.

P.M. The latter.

The Bill – responsibility with M/L and M/D.

[Enter H.McN.

383

4. (Contd) Mining of Destroyers in Corfu Channel. H.McN. They cd. ask someone (eg Yugoslavs) to do it for them.

A.V.A. F.O. suggn cuts across internatl organn for sweeping. R. are repd there.

P.M. Med. Minesweepg. Bd. decision 2 days ago. Can we ascertain whr. R. repve

was present.

A.V.A. Delay will reduce chance of

P.M. I wd. like E.B.’s views. Delay action m’while: &amp; find out if R. was present

on Bd. &amp; what line he took.

Agreed: decision to be left to P.M., with A.V.A. &amp; G.H.

H.McN. Albania cd. ask for it to go on Assembly Agenda. Tho’ we wd. prefer Sec. Council. In either event our pol. case wd. be damaged if we first went ahead with sweeping w’out askg. Albania.

C.N.S. They have no sweepers.

[Enter Barnes &amp; J.B.H.

[Exit C.O.S., de Fr., F.B., G.H., J.W.

6. United Kingdom Bread Supplies.

P.M. Does this memo. take sufft. a/c of Cab.’s decision of last week re general approach.

J.S. Yes: not inconsistent.

H.McN. Separate approach as in 4 wd. prejudice any subseqn. approach re world as a

whole &amp; esp. for B. Zone. If we had got the 860.000 T. we shd. be

asked to contribute out of that.

J.S. We put whole picture before them. But we shd. emphasise tht. – quite apart fr. B. Zone, where all we want of them is pooling – if we are to avoid reducing bread ration we must have wheat fr. U.K. Want authty to put U.K. demand on 1st priority.

H.McN. If we get agreemt. on 700.000 t. w’out agreemt. re Germany, we are no further whole case shd. be argued as one.

J.B.H. Read telegram fr. Berlin on conversations with Clay on pooling.

1.3 m. tons fr. Canada not allocated. Canada won’t let their wheat go to G. U.S. believe pressure must be put on U.K. to force Canadian wheat to G. – wh. Canada want to use for re-entry to commercial markets.

384

J.S. Canada’s supply is limited, whatever the availabilities. Wd. be madness to divert to G. any of what they can ship.

The view reflected in this telegram is what we must fight in Washington.

R.S.C. Let E.B. have some discretion how he puts his case.

Will save us dollars.

P.M. Agree long-term. Diversion made only because short haul.

Don’t tie it down as in 14 (ii).

P.M. We can’t avoid line suggd in 14 (ii).

J.S. May Control Ofl. be instructed to join with M/F in attacking U.S.

P.L. Don’t overlook India. Shippings slipping. Hope E.B. is going to present the whole picture. &amp; as soon as possible.

P.M. That is agreed.

J.S. Yes: but hope we won’t put India &amp; Germany before U.K.

P.M. Don’t let us go over ground of last Thursday’s discussion.

J.B.H. Is recommendn 14 (ii) accepted?

P.M. Yes. Was agreed that 2 Zones be pooled. That relieved us of supplying out of U.K. stocks. We must have a firm decision on this &amp; make it known to U.S.

H.McN. Is it reasonable for Cab. to decide that 836.000 t. must go to U.K. when they don’t know what total available will be.

J.B.H. 836.000 is figure reqd to abolish bread rationing by 1st Sept. We are askg. U.S. to guarantee that.

H.McN. Can Cab. be asked to review later, 14 (ii), if need arises?

P.M. Cab. like the Ritz is open to all (Ministers).

A. India: must do more to help themselves. We are diverting to India Aust. wheat that might come to us.

J.S. Austr. want to re-enter U.K. market. It is for considn whr we shdn’t allow some – and let India draw pro tauts on Argentine U.S. etc.

Switch back, partially, as soon as condns permit.

J.B.H. Germany. B. Zone: deficit 90.000 at end of Oct (? Nov).

385

H.M. And instruct C.C. tht. we can’t provide &amp; they must make that clear to their

U.S. colleagues.

Rec. 14 (v)

[Exit J.B.H.

7. Groundnuts in Central Africa.

J.S. If this memo. approved, I will consider how scheme can be improved.

P.M. Wait until we have proposals.

R.S.C. Make it quite clear that rationing will continue.

Scheme wd. start under M/F. – w’out using funds of Col. Development

Fund. Contemplate early establmt of Corpn: then share with Col.

Govts.: eventually pass over whole thing to Col. Govts.

Propose to start only in Tanganyika. Capital wd. go largely in clearing bush

buying plant &amp; equipment, bldgs.

J.S. Need more urgent since U.S. de-controlled fats. 60% of present ration

comes fr. Empire: must increase it &amp; quickly.

Agree to £3m. on condn a) M/F run it, not C.O. b) U.K. get the fats, not a

pool.

C.J. Heavy capital outlay – wd. need more examn – but some start must be made at once if any early benefit to be got.

Figures based on v. conservative estimates.

Recognise I shan’t get any excavators etc. for U.K. Can improvise with surplus vehicles etc.

H.D. Support in principle mainly because of switch to sterling sources of supply.

E.Sh. This really can’t be done w’out plant. M/F say 100 crawler tractors. And they say you can get them in Africa. Why weren’t we told. We wd. have liked them.

J.S. We aren’t expectg. any from open-cast coal. We think we can do somethg. with improvised machinery. If we can’t, the project fails.

H.M. Cdn’t we have a quick report in 2 wks.

J.S. a) then short-term 1948 crop wd. be missed.

b) 2 wks is too short for the long-term scheme.

Agreed: on understanding tht. it doesn’t involve upsetting other

appd schemes for which special types of tractors are

required.

A.V.A. Cd. we have a rpt. on fats in interim – 2 years.

386

R.S.C. Comes up every month in L.P. Cttee. Let A.V.A. see L.P. pp.
