C.M. 97 (46) 18th November, 1946 1. Anglo. Egyptian Treaty

Sidky will now put it to C/Ministers &amp; to Parlt. in 5 Session.

Always thought Delegn wd. be close thing.

2.

H.McN. Delegn informed: broken up w’out decision: atmosphere unfavourable.

G. Genl. Sudan will return Thurs. Sudan. Delegation to come to Ldn.

Spain

Draft resolution proposed by E. B. (Tel. 1694) from N. York) read to

Cabinet.

H.McN. Discussed with Doms. &amp; some W. Powers.

More drastic resolutions will be put in by others. But likely that ours will command majority support.

T.W. What will be effect re fertilisers, steel, etc.

General view – no.

E.B.’s proposal approved.

3.

H.McN. This resloln doesn’t involve econ. sanctions. Any resolution calling for sanctions wd. be advisory only.

H.M. Cd. final para. be softened?

Indians in South Africa.

A. Summarised telegram 1668.

Accept last para.

4.

My view – S. African legn is not in conflict with human rights.

{ Position noted.

{ Delegation to be instructed – as on last sentence of telegr.

Germany.

P.M. Arrangements in Germany. Asked E.B. for views on Resident Minister.

[Exit H.McN. &amp; O.S.

5.

Mention because Cab. are disturbed.

Parliament: Debate on Address.

H.D. On official Cons. amendmt.

H.M. I will follow mover: will B/T or C/E follow?

404

P.M. H.D. to speak to-day on Conscription. R.S.C. shd. spk. on the other.

Agreed.

H.M. Want to tell Parlt. there will be genl. econ. debate: &amp; a White Paper (tho’ may be argument on form of W. Paper).

Generally agreed.

Party discipline: must be handled at Party mtg.

But P.P.S.’s mustn’t do this. Three are in it. They shd. resign, if they want

to do this.

A.B. There are precedents - e.g. in Liberal Govt.

P.P.S. – accept posn to assist Minister. Must he resign if he disagrees with

Govt. on matter wh. isn’t Departmental to his Minister?

P.M. F. Aff. Debate. Won’t help our posn vis-à-vis U.S.A.

Depends whr. it is steady course of action over period.

Enough to warn them. v. continuance.

P.M. Public expn of “no confidence” in Govt. is inappropriate to a P.P.S.

A.B. Resignation of 5 P.P.S.’s wd. do more harm.

Best to play this down. Much feeling in Party over foreign policy – inevitable there shd. be some expn of this.

E.Sh. In Coalition, tho’ I criticised, I never added my name to amendment of Address because involves public expn of “no confidence”. But can’t be disguised that there is uneasiness in Party over f. policy. Diff. for members to refrain fr. expressg. their opinions tho’ it shdn’t have bn. done by amendmt. of Address. Members, havg. first expd their view at Party mtg., have right to express views in H/C. There are limits to extent to wh. pressed.

This sort of thing always reflects deep feeling.

I have twice raised matters wh. I thght. v. important - over to Cab.: other to P.M. who decided not to bring it to Cab. Am still dissatisfied on 2nd ques. (M/East policy). The other (Germany): I’m sure I was right, as events have proved. But Cab. thought pl. shd. outweigh economics consns.

Cab. not fully appraised of condns of strategy wh. may dictate f. policy. Not easy for us to raise ques. of f. policy at Cabinet. Not much chance.

No genl. discn of f. policy as a whole.

P.M. We can have a genl. talk re f. policy.

But P.P.S. issue is narrower. Can have dissenting view: but another matter to support amendment to Address. At least they shd. first ask their Minister.

H.M. P.P.S. – no doubt re gravity. Quin: sack them at once, or warn them “not again”.

405

Govt. are collectively respons. for f. policy.

Another point – what does E.B. think of the Ministers whose P.P.S.’s do

this?

sack them.

H.M. Debate on Closed Shop (Tuesday). Will G.A.I. say what line he will take?

What is meant by “Closed Shop” – used to be “closed to T.U.C.”

Don’t oppose workers workg. for 100% membership.

E.Sh. Be careful. Snags. Break-away Union; a no. of these wd. break T.U.

structure.

If this amendmt. carried Govt. wd. fall – is therefore vote of censure.

May not assume they have discussed with their Ministers? Liable to cause lack of confidence between Ministers.

This conduct can’t continue. Exaggerates impn of fission. Only ques. to sack w’out warning – or warn.

R.S.C. Agree with H.M. Only ques is whr. they are given a 2nd chance. On the whole, favour warning (by Ministers concerned).

T.W. Agree.

A.G. Position can’t be ignored. K. speech debate is special case.

Believe many acted in ignorance. Prefer therefore warning.

Generally agreed: warn P.P.S.’s – can’t occur again – but don’t

Political mistake to seem to be encouraging a tyrannical T.U. attitude.

A. T.U.C. have thrice declared against closed shop policy.

Debate in H/Lds. last week. I criticised “closed shop” tactics on other side. e.g. light castings industry.

T.W. Problems in mining industry. Are technicians to be forced into N.U.M.

G.A.I. Oppn trying to attack refusal of T.U.’s to work with break-away Unions.

Answer must depend on what line criticism takes.

E.Sh. L.a.’s passing resolns v. employing anyone not belonging to Union’s capable of affiliation to T.U.C. What about teachers? Issue will be raised in debate.

A.B. Avoid dif. statement on future policy – because many awkward ques.

G.A.I. Will avoid l.a. ques.

Govt. doesn’t intend to dictate wh. Union a man shall belong to.
