C.M. 46(46). 14th May, 1946.

India: Constitutional Question. one each.

P.M. Agree para. 22 is not enough – can include reference to defence of

P.M. Summd &amp; explained lay-out of statement.

Para. 15 onwds. Decns necessarily set out scheme for constitn

because otherwise constit. assembly wdn’t meet: not

finally decided.

Para. 20. deals with smaller communities.

P.9. Repves of smaller provinces – point raised by me – they got

A. P. 7. “Genl” includes Hindus &amp; Depressed classes. Is it clear?

P.M. Clear enough. Weightage for d. classes w’out votes.

Para. 19 VIII . Changed.

A. Para. 24. Final para. wd. be much stronger if it embodied P.M.’s

statement quoted in para. 1.

E.W. And a word about B. rule in India.

P.M. Letter from P.L. dated 10/5. Substantial p’ess in bridging gulf betwn.

H. &amp; Mosl. even tho’ Confce broke down. Note by Viceroy

showg. extent to wh. agreement was reached before the

break-down. V. remarkable measure of consent to main

features of scheme. Good hope of their acceptance of the

scheme if put fwd. by H.M.G.

J. Para. 14. Paramountcy. Is it certain tht. P. wd. be impossible if India

came into Comm.? H.M. wd. then be King of India.

P.M. P. implies you have the forces there with wh. to exercise power –

otherwise you can’t enforce P. Unless you handed over to

Indian Ministers the duty of advising H.M. on these ques.

E.W. What provn for safeguarding B. interests?

P.M. Treaty. But can’t make it until there is another Party to it i.e.

constituent Assembly.

E.Sh. Cdn’t you insert words to that effect – mentiong. need to preserve our

strategic interests in India. Pol. implicns – being labelled

Little Englanders.

India.

Add: “in particular for common defence interests and all

necessary matters. Agreed. 193

E.W. When do we hand over power – as soon as const. assembly apptd,

even tho’ we don’t know wtr. it will succeed?

P.M. Not until it has completed its constitution. But not later. There must

be a de facto Govt. pro tem. – we make the Treaty with them.

Then legn in U.K. to change G/India Act. Until that legn passes,

no final change can be made. While constit. assembly is at work,

existg. constitn remains in being.

E.W. Need for big gesture now re remaing. in B. Comm. ? Big Conference

of Doms. to discuss with India advantages of staying in the Club.

Can’t we avoid seeming to leave this as a side issue.

But I do think this statement assumes too much tht. India will choose

P.M. Can’t do that: in view of how we sent them out.

to go out.

Add: after 15. “This solution is applicable wtr. India decides on

independence within or without the B. Commonwealth.” And

consequentials in para. 24.

Also ms. amendmt. written into para. 14.

Short statement &amp; W. Paper.

Copy to Opposn in advance.

t’gram.

Also simultaneous announcemt. in H/Lds.
