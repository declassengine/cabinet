C.M. 65 (46) 5th July, 1946

1. Cabinet Mission to India

Welcome: congratns: patience (trying phys. condns) v. diff. problems. Need for rest.

2. Eire: Membership of U.N.O. U.S. initiative now. Don’t want U.S. to get in first. Now want authy to

inform Eire Govt. tht. if they apply we will support.

C.E. N.I. may fear Partition will come to U.N.O. as result: may cause trouble

with N.I.

N.B. F.O. support D.O. view.

A. Referred to earlier decision.

But am keeping N.I. Govt. infod.

3. Parliament House will expect a statement. But with this informal mtg. we might avoid

any debate, or long debate, before Recess.

R.S.C. Some debate now

H.M. W.S.C. wished 2 days for India &amp; Parliament.

Cd. Cab. Mission + P.M. see W.S.C. and A.E. + Cranbourne and A.N. Other.

wd. be better than end/July. Must be statement, and wd.

think short debate also inevitable. Statement must be long.

Discussion deferred.

4. India: Report of Cabinet Mission Diffies of negotn. No one who can spk. for Congress – no one to make a deal

– Azad can’t &amp; doesn’t commit Congress. Also Ejhandi –

unpredictable: nor can he commit Congress: but Congress agreement

isn’t firm w’out him.

Hot weather. Everyone cross &amp; someone always away!

P.L. Thanks for congratns. Arduous task.

All v. suspicious, both of us &amp; one another. Everything therefore must be in writing.

First month spent in seeing everyone &amp; exploring the ground. Saw them in private as well as public. Thus arrived at idea of settlement wh. we hadn’t in view when we left – the 3-tier system. This in a small country wd. be over elaborate. But that objn doesn’t apply in India –

274

whose popn exceeds sum of U.K., U.S.A. &amp; U.S.S.R. We concluded it was only hope of solution. At Simila got them a long way twds. agreement on this.

They offered to consult separately: broke down: &amp; we issued our statement

of 16/5.

Finally, Azad indicated that settlement wd. be reached if we gave assurances

about new status of interim Govt. We gave them: then Congress raised

all the other points!

Jinnah indicated readiness to accept this &amp; abandon sou. Pakistan.

Nehru, while rejecting parity, offered system by wh. major ques. wd. require majority of each communal Party.

That was one of our 2 tasks: the long-term solution. The other – formn of interim Govt. – we decided to leave conversns to Viceroy. He saw both sides on basis of 5:5:2 (minorities) Govt. Jinnah assumed 5 Congress repves wd. all be Hindus. Congress insisted tht. this Govt. shd. have real power, &amp; not be Advisory Council.

I believed some accommn wd. be poss. short of altering constitution.

Then statement of 16/6 re interim Govt. Clause wh. will become important in future penultimate para. of India 71. We were thinking of Jinnah, if we were thinking of anyone. We were prepd to put Jinnah in &amp; leave Congress outside if they wdn’t co-operate. That was a heavy responsibility, wh. we were prepd to take.

Delays. Eventually told Congress we wanted an answer by 23.6. About then, a v. unfortunate thing happened. Congress were on verge of accepting – resolution had bn. carried tho’ against advice of Ghandi (who advised Congress to remain a national not solely a Hindu body). But they delayed communicating. Azad saw Viceroy &amp; suggd nominatg. Moslem in place of one in the list. Viceroy told Jinnah, who exploded &amp; wrote to newspaper. Press also had headline “Congress admits it is Hindu Body”. This publicity turned the scales: &amp; they decided to reject the interim Govt. proposal. But they then reflected tht. if they also turned down 16/5 scheme on long term, they wd. be left behind. With unexpected result tht. they accepted long-term &amp; rejected

interim!

I believe there is a good chance that both sides will play.

Viceroy is v. gloomy: thinks it’s a patched-up business &amp; won’t last.

Believe truth lies nearer my view.

b) What about interim Govt.

Fear Viceroy began by offering Moslems too much. They are

only 1/3

rd &amp; it’s a bit steep to deny that Congress representatives may

ever include a Moslem.

Don’t believe we’ll get Congress in on basis of 16/6.

There phrase in India 71 came into play. Viceroy has to start forming another Govt.

Congress argued that talks must now start again. We thought everyone was tired – useless to go on – decided to leave an interval. We came home…

Two Questions:

a) How far will long-term plan be worked?

275

Must consider what guidance we give to Viceroy.

Diff. to conceive central Govt. w’out Congress. Wd. like to see a

Coalition: only way of holding fort. They all agree in principle but

not on terms.

Parliament (resumed)

Debate will bring out disagreeable features. But much published in India

already.

We shd. have to defend ourselves as best we can w’out exposing failings of

Indians.

Also don’t under estimate success in establ. the constitn makg. body.

x/ Publish the W. Paper &amp; have early short debate. Informal mtg. with Oppn

(both Houses).

A.V.A. Control over our Govt. supporters: necessary in Viceroy’s interest.

If any debate, earlier the better. 3rd or 4th wk. July wd. be awkward for Viceroy wd. then be forming Govt.

P.M. Won’t do any good. But doubt if we can hold H/C.

The disagreeable facts will come out anyway.

Agreed at x/.

R.S.C. Change of temper in India: believe w’out sincerity.

Agreed: D.O. to consider disposal of L.S.T’s etc.
