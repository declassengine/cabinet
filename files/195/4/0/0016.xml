C.M. 28(46). 28th March, 1946.

1. Parliament. Business for next week.

2. India. [Exit W.W. and H.M.

P.M. Procedure for handling Cab. Mission business

a) India Cttee

b) Circulation of telegrams.

As in my minute to P.M. Agreed.

3. Sarawak. [Enter E.B.

G.H. As in memo. Para. 6. This point was raised over Malaya. Complete examn will

take some months.

If any delay over Sarawak, there will be diffy.

P.M. Uneasy re Tuan Muda &amp; his son. Justice shd. be seen to be done.

They are entitled under the will to succeed. You are going to get

state his case. He’s bn. asked by Paramount Chief to go out.

J. Wdn’t it be wise to give him a sweetener – raising his allowance.

P.M. Not a ques. of that – it’s his legal rights.

of his son.

But if we try to over-ride Rajah, he will refuse cession.

P.M. Is there any law in Sarawak?

that set aside – isn’t it a bit much to refuse him leave to go out.

You say he has no rights: I’m advised tht. he has a claim to go &amp;

J. If you don’t give him right to state his case, give him some more cash.

G.H. Tuan Muda himself has relinquished claim because ill-health in favour

G.H. He is autocrat – complete powers over Council Negri.

P.M. But not in respect of the wills. V. high-handed to forbid him to go.

At the moment we, not Rajah, control the territory.

E.B. This is a bad moment to get a cession of territory durg. mil. occupn.

c.f. Persia.

G.H. Adminn will be handed over to civil power. 97

E.B. V. dangerous in those circs. to allow Tuan M. &amp; his son to develop

a grievance.

G.H. The offer of cession was volunteered w’out any pressure from us.

Cab. authd me to arrange the cession.

P.M. Not asking you to abandon the idea of cession. Don’t do something

which looks bad.

Remember we control the territory now.

Must see Rajah &amp; press him to allow Anthony Brooke to go out.

money.

E.B. Cdn’t we get them to accept an arbitn here under High Co. Judge –

the tribunal in Sarawak wdn’t give an impartial verdict.

G.H. But it is the territory which Anthony Brooke is claiming – not the

E.B. If he makes a fuss, anyone cd. get the ques. put to Sec. Council.

Must devise some judicial means of settling this.

G.H. I will see Rajah &amp; press him to allow Bertram Brooke to go out.

P.M. Ld. Chanc. to consider first. No action meanwhile.

H.D. On para. 6. L.O.’s went outside their t. of r. &amp; made a bad recommn.

[Enter G.T. &amp; Dugdale.

4. Building: Shortage of Brick-workers. come out in Cl. B.

P.M. A v. one-sided statement.

A.B. Can’t expect to hold posn if bldg. delayed in July/Aug. for lack of

bricks.

Recited the course of earlier discussions. Decision by Housing Squad

undermined by Man Power Cttee. All this involved delay: and

wastage fr. brick-works equals intake. Don’t care what method

is used so long as I get the men. M’while best bldg. weather of

the year is on us - &amp; no prospect of bricks.

Class B. releases – months ago thousands of names given &amp; now have

come out.

All the recommns made by For. Secy. are dependent on readiness to

If housing is a priority, the men ought to come out as a priority.

E.B. suggests getting bricks fr. Belgium to wake up the industry.

They can’t be awakened if they have no labour force.

a) Not true tht. Services have bn. un-cooperative. Brick-workers

weren’t first priority class in housing – experts, bricklayers

etc., came first.

b) Housing Squad scheme wdn’t work.

98

J.J.L. All requests made have bn. properly considered.

On b) if you offered Cl. A. benefits to brickmakers, at least 90.000

men already out wd. claim same benefits. Wd. break down

Cl. A. releases – discontent.

A.B. I accept that. Don’t care what methods Service Dpts. adopt, so long

as they produce the men.

E.B. Came to M. Power Cttee in Oct. re B. releases. This Govt. shd. be

careful not to dishonour pledges re demobilisation scheme.

I suggested raising B. releases to 15% - &amp; no complaint since

made to M. Power Cttee that it isn’t working properly. Heard

Believe it’s 200.000 men affected in Cl. B. – not 90.000.

These two decisions shd. have given 450.000 extra.

no complaint until after Housing Squad.

In addn to raising Class B. to 15% I brght. June dates back to May.

Belgium. I believe brick trade is complacent – on both sides

failure to make the industry attractive. Frighten them by bringing

Belgium in – as the bldg. trade always did pre-war.

How many affected? 1.500/2.000

G.T. These are the named men. 6,000 is the real need.

apparently.

Can’t get the bricks in time by man-power means, whatever you do.

e) Why won’t these key men come out? They are the well paid

E.B. However you w’draw fr. Army they must come in ones &amp; two’s &amp; fr.

all round the world. I thought, in addn to starting this flow, wise

to get big quantities of bricks in to meet the gap in summer.

Even if you get the skilled men out of Forces, you’ll have diffy.

in getting the b:1 unskilled labourers. You need 36.000

That’s why I made the supplementary suggn.

This man-power scheme isn’t final.

I took 6 days on this job, when referred to me.

A.B. Was already looking into Belgian bricks – a) don’t know what stock

they have b) don’t know about transport.

H.D. I wd. raise no financial diffies over import/bricks next few months.

G.A.I. a) Records of pre-war labour in all brick-works.

b) Many works choked with stores e.g. 1 m. bricks in one place.

c) Must get p.o.w. &amp; Poles to back up the skilled workers.

Accommn then.

P.M. Put p.o.w. in tents.

G.A.I. d) Have convened this complacent industry.

men who don’t have the dirty work to do. We therefore

favour further appeal.

99

f) London Brick Stewartby are willing to take p.o.w. &amp; Poles.

P.M. Nominated men?

G.T. 3.107 to W.O. up to 15/3. 1.644 position not known.

3.935 to all Services up to 15/3. 2.977 sent to M/L. by 30/11.

Delay is in respect of men overseas.

directed

Housing Squad – 6 recommns: all but 1st are going ahead.

I wasn’t surprised to hear diffy. over 1st. I agreed at M.-Power Cttee

tht. it cdn’t be pressed. I was told, however, that men wd. be to this work. Was satisfied with that. But the present

plan isn’t “direction” &amp; wdn’t produce the men in time.

S. 520 applied for 360 out.

D. We cd. do this – a handful of men only.

P.M. Why was it turned down?

E.B. If you use power to call up for mil. service to direct to civil labour,

disobed. will involve mil. penalties. Can Serv. Ministers accept

that?

Durg. war we never applied mil. penalties. The men who went to

aircraft factories went voluntarily.

Cd. you really enforce direction? Using Army Act for that purpose.

Cd. you do in peace what we never did in war?

J.J.L. Cd. supply Pioneers for unskilled labour.

Asked for 1.500 in Feb. Asked for 3.000 volunteers for

Cl. B. (Feb. 27th).

E.Sh. Caution re use of compulsion.

Why weren’t we warned earlier of impending labour shortage in

brick works.

We shd. know how many bricks we need over 2 years.

if they refuse deliberately.

{ Rpt. to be made to P.M. re

E.B. In (c) omit words “unless ….. objn” &amp; tell Commrs. no mil. penalties

Agreed { E.B. to consider wording of scheme, to make it

{ firmer. import of bricks fr.

{ Belgium.

E.B. Shipping must be improvised – by M/T. and Admy.

Coal from Ruhr.

I wd. talk to Belg. Minister if Ty. &amp; M/H. scheme were prepd.

A.B. I will approach E.B. when I have the facts.

100

E.Sh. Can I be told early what coal will be needed for bricks over future

months.
