C.M. 69 (46) 18th July, 1946 1. Parliament

H.M. Business for next week.

E.B. Palestine: debate awkward at this stage. Govt. cd. say nil or imperil

settlement.

E.B. Spoke to AE – willing to be reasonable if Govt. supporters will lay off

equally.

A. Samuel &amp; Cranborne want debates on a) Palestine &amp; b) F. Affairs.

Samual is insistent on a) – not accommodatg. Told him p’mme full up to

29/30 July. : subject to consultn with Cab. those days available.

A. Debate on F. Affairs: Samuel &amp; Perth. insistg. on it. Said only 30/7. But

Cranb. is willing not to press.

Will have to debate W. Paper. Thing is to avoid saying anything on longterm.

Consult Parties &amp; invite p’ponement until after Recess.

Can’t get debate even at end/July because anticipatg. discns with J &amp; Arabs.

H.M. Will try. Remember firm promises given.

H.M. Silverman, Crossman etc. Cd. they be squared by 3.30 p.m.?

W. Paper will be published. May say Parlt. helpless. P.M. incldg. W.S.C.

G.H. I.S. said y’day he wd. press for a debate.

J. If you do have debate, limit it to present &amp; leave out future.

P.M. E.B. cd. see Samuel &amp; Perth.

Try to square Parties on that.

[Enter J.S.

2. Bread Rationing.

J.S. Rather surprising news from Canada –

Asked Gardiner to confirm. For if confirmed case for rationing as safety

measure collapses.

70/100m. bushels higher than any prev. estimate. 450m. bushels minimum.

Decision was taken in principle before I assumed office. Went to Am. largely to see whr. this was unavoidable. Hoped to recomm. p’ponement of decision. But on day of my return found figures wh. were alarming.

289

Felt unable on those facts to over-rule strong view of Cereals Divn. in

favour of rationing.

This a.m. have assurance from Gardiner of minimum of 450 m. bushels – expects more rather than less: wdn’t be surprised if 500m. Gives me authy to announce expectn of 450m. I asked also for authy to give assurance tht. we wd. get 200m. (vice 160m). He won’t give me that authy.: tho’ no doubt we shd. get up to 200m. out of crop of 450m.

M.S. supply as before. Shall be tight by end/Aug. But rationing wdn’t alter that.

My view therefore is tht. it’s safe to p’pone rationing. Keep scheme in being: but unlikely we shd. need it.

Grave pol. embarrassment, of course. Running away from the bakers.

On supply posn, correct decision = p’pone.

P.M. We decided on this as precaution because 2 uncertainties

a) U.S. supplies and b) U.K. weather

c)

told also tht. physical limitns in increasg. exports fr. Canada because eastern elevators wd. be empty. Crisis was next 2 months.

J.S. These were M/F points. My view now. b) we have written down reliance on U.K. to a safe point. On c) I’m satisf. tht. if Can. wheat avail. in winter we can ship it, at inconvenience of longer hauls.

P.M. d) J.B.H. told us last week there wd. be absolute shortage in G. w’out U.S. early supply.

J.S. Admit p’ponement will be internat. loss of bargaining power.

On a) U.S. July supplies are afloat: Hutton is confident tht. replacement deliveries will come thro’. Now able to test estimates v. nationalisation.

On d) our hand wd. be strengthened if we rationed.

P.M. Suppose a real crisis in G.

J.S. Wd. only announce p’ponement for a month.

A.V.A. Rlway workers’ demand for higher pay: seamen on Lakes – in Canada.

J.S. That will be safe enough.

P.M. Can. supply situation was never major factor in our decision.

J.S. Entwined with genl. supply sitn – short &amp; long.

P.M. I assumed crisis was before Can. crop began to move.

J.B.H. If b’down in G., gt. pressure on us to divert shipment to U.K. Diff. if we have no bread rationing.

290

Psychologically: we’ve won the battle: mistake to change now.

G. thought we’d decided not to divert from U.K.

J.S. No.

b) Don’t be sure Canada won’t get involved in it too. Big timber strike

recently. Strikes in Can. v. long.

Let M/F say one of his first steps will be to improve quality of bread.

T.W. Change of decn will be criticised.

A. If we can get extra supplies, right thing wd. be to increase animal food by shortening extraction.

Politically, v. diff. to run away now fr. what was criticised as a hasty decision.

A.B. Material situation hasn’t altered enough to warrant change of policy.

Argument: stock posn too tight to run risks.

Need = variation of diet. Any relief shd. go into animal food.

H.M. Arguments the other way. If it were clear it was unnecessary we shdn’t do it.

Shdn’t ration for sake of it. If facts were clear, I wd. relieve bakers &amp; housewives of worry of this.

If it proves troublesome &amp; is unnecessary – trouble.

U.S. reactions. Wdn’t worry because they never wanted us to have to ration.

Problem: if you reverse situation, what convincing reason cd. you give to H/C.

E.W. Will Gardiner say tht. he has given guarantee tht. made rationing unnecessary.

R.S.C. Best line = say improved crop prospects: greater hope therefore that it will be short-term but short-term problem still acute.

H.D. “Don’t gamble with nation’s food” – still holds good.

E.B. a) Believe there will be big strikes in U.S. in Sept. Raising of price controls.

c) On 9 wks. stock, strike in Lpl. or Ldn. wd. knock you down to 4 wks.

Near the knuckle

d) Now to end/Sept is biggest movement of population. Points scheme as “2nd currency” facilitates flexibility of supply movement. When holidays began in U.K., millions said 2 wks. addl. stock was required.

U.S. reactions will be dangerous.

Agreed: Let decision stand.

[Exeunt J.S.

291

3. India Short point: if Jinnah won’t come in, we must go on w’out him.

P.M. Have bn. into this (guidance to Viceroy) with Cab. Mission.

Approved.

4. Amendment of British North America Act.

A. As in memo. Letter received – Prayer passed, legn wanted before Recess.

Draft Bill follows earlier precedents – 1943 &amp; earlier.

A. More than 2:1 majority in both Can. Houses. We can’t challenge their

decision.

P.M. There was

No notice given by Canada.

P.M. May not be able to pass this w’out controversy.

No controversy in H/Lds.

trouble in ’43. Strong objn taken because Act laid down propns in

Provinces for protection of minorities. Can. Govt. want it rushed to

prevent Can. objns being voiced in Westminster.

A.

Manitoba &amp; Sask. are only losers: &amp; no pressure from them.

5. Paper for Fascist Publications

Figures. Re-distns will give 8 (out of 10) of the extra members to Quebec.

J. Mere accident tht. Can. didn’t take over under St. of W’minister.

But we are obliged to do what Can. asks. We shd. not argue merits at all. Mustn’t get involved in Can. politics.

H.M. Bring it in &amp; try to get it thro’ But if substantl trouble, may have to hold over until autumn.

Agreed: H/Lds first.

[Exit W.W. J.J.L.

A.B. Conditions are not normal. These arguments are directed to a normal state of affairs. People will consider this in light of concrete situatn.

E.B. Will cause mis-understanding abroad. De.nazification etc. And yet we give paper for this. What wd. Molotov say?

R.S.C. This is giving it to a publisher, not Fascist.

292

P.M. On what basis do you deny supplies? Are you going to ration paper acc. to

type of publn? Better proclaim the organisation illegal.

A.B. Why haven’t they published before?

R.S.C. Because h’to they haven’t got hold of a publisher who had paper. Are you

willing to change the law?

A.V.A. E.B’s point will have to be considered in due course by electorate.

Let E.B.’s point come to L.P. Cttee.

C.E. Commonwealth Party. Acland bought a T. &amp; C.P. paper: &amp; applied the quota of paper to advocation of his pol. principles. Govt. didn’t object.

This book will not attract attentn. You will draw more attentn to it.

P.M. If you want to stop this, you must enact legn empowering prohibtn of this type of book. If E.B. thinks that essential, we must face it. But much too dangerous to use this weapon.

We are spending much on rooting out Nazi-ism in G. Shall we allow this book to be exported to G.?

H.D. Cd. we have recommns for action to cover points raised by E.B. &amp; A.V.A.

Agreed: Approve memo.
