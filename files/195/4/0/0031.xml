C.M. 43(46). 7th May, 1946.

1. Policy towards Germany.

on pp. 5-6.

U.K. policy. We shd. spk. out more – we shd. tell G. publicly

b) teach them to make success of their democracy. We are

P.M. First page gives E.B.’s line. Remainder, arguments. Alternatives

My own view – try for unified policy on E.B.’s line – a) because of

end we wish to reach b) because attempt to achieve W. Policy

wd. involve us in expendre of resources we can’t afford. Diffies

of econ. posn in W. Zone. Not in posn to make W. Zone

attractive as cpd. eastern zone &amp; on that grd. alone we shd. go for

federal centralised G.

H.M. Recognise weak posn in wh. we’ve bn. driven.

Will be realised Potsdam was disastrous &amp; we shall have to move

away fr. it.

We are being pushed around – must try &amp; get the lead. R. getting

the food: repns makg. econ. nonsense of W. Zone: we have

unemplt., no food, &amp; genl. chaos for wh. Comm. will blame

why these condns arise. We shd. ask R. publicly how they

defend their policy. No use going on grumbling inter nos.

We must stand out in G. Aims a) prevent further aggression but

doing somethg. on these lines but not takg. enough public credit

for it.

Agree with E.B. federal state with some central Govt. is right. Believe

he is a bit pessimistic re inevitability of Comm. triumph, even in

E. Germany. May over-estimate power of Comm. in G.

No good dismembering – they wd. come together again in time. Thus,

allow an adequate Govt. at centre with strong federal Govts. in

Provinces.

My doubts are wtr. in interim we are pushg. ourselves fwd. sufficiently

as champions of democracy. Will educate, not only G., but Fr.

and U.S.A. – possibly USSR. eventually. Beware of drifting into

anti-Soviet policy as matter of course.

P.M. Diff. to separate this from Food Situation in G.

Alarming picture from Robertson. Memo. read to Cabinet.

H.D. Disturbed for some time. As H.M. said, worst of both worlds.

Political. Financial, too.

As betwn. the 2 courses, more workg. out of econ. &amp; finan.

consequences. Unified G. might cost us even more.

Most powerful part of memo. is para. 10. And I think it conclusive –

we cdn’t face those consequences.

Essential to avoid drifting into automatic anti-Sov. policy. Don’t share

the view expd at x/ on p.3. Not long-term. But agree with

followg. sentence that worse of all wd. be R. &amp; G.

175

“Unified Germany” sometimes thght. like Nazi State. Need to

Potsdam proposals for centralised G. He argues for autonomous

decentralise as much as possible. Dismemberment rejected

because wdn’t be permanent. We ought however to get G. to

accept a constitn with large amount of de-centralisation – incldg.

a Ruhr Province. It is the highly centralised G. that wd. be our

gt. danger.

P.M. Does anyone favour alternative?

A.B. Don’t follow F.O. memo. Seems to ride 2 horses. Doesn’t support

Fed. units. Will that give contented G! Peaceful G. only if she

gets constitn she wants. Madness to suppose we can impose,

preserve unpopular Fed. system.

Memo. views R. thro’ G. I’m not afraid of R. comg. west. They will

History shows that, when primitive peoples conquer civilised, latter

if G. seeks federal system themselves. In G., R. is promoting &amp;

Inspn alone wd. prevent aggression – garrisons will bring trouble.

themselves be influenced: &amp; re-actions v. them set in as they

come in contact with sympathisers.

Shock to R. troops when they came in contact with richer civilisations

of w.

absorbs former in the end.

Don’t impose a constitution – agitn v. it will be fostered by R. – o.k.

preaching centralisation.

Agree with H.M. regarding publicity for our p’essive policy in G. No

substantial policy.

Our safety depends in the end on allowing G. to choose own system.

J. Agree re imposition.

Approve E.B.’s policy. This is not moment at wh. final decision can

E.Sh. All the logic is v. E.B.’s policy: but it’s only practical course.

being econ. chaos &amp; starvation.

she goes, greater her diffy. She has fish to fry in M/E. &amp; F/E.

be taken.

Fear of Comm. spreadg. to west because starvation is its breeding

ground. Only if decent condns can be restored, Comm. tide will

recede – as it’s doing in Fr. &amp; Czechosl.

For the moment therefore temporise.

Agree with H.M. re public justifn for our policy - &amp; not our fault

P.M. Remember tht. attempts to get central adminn of G. have bn. stopped

by Fr.

Primary aim – prevent revival as mil. power. To do that, brk. it up,

Secondary aim – create peaceful democr. nation. For that you need

integration not dismemberment.

Implicit in memo. to attempt to prevent R. fr. dominatg. Europe.

Doubt wtr. pol. penetrn by R. can go as far as feared. Further

If she disperses her forces, she won’t succeed. R. has less 176

capacity for col. adminn than we have. They will event. find

they’re cuttg. little ice with people of the countries concerned.

Purpose of P. Protocol was centralised economic G. Find it diff. to

reconcile that with Fed. political G.

Another way out – w’draw from W. Zone.

the consequences of Potsdam declaration.

But agree, pro tem, we must try E.B.’s policy. And force R. to realise

J.J.L. Support idea of Fed. unified Germany.

If we haven’t publicised our policy, it’s because we haven’t had one.

We’ve bn. in interim period.

Federal – not long since parts of G. had own Parlts.

This policy puts us right with original Potsdam Decln.

Agree with A.B. re Russia – consequences of her internal diffies.

Early decn re occupying troops. Believe we cd. usefully remain. our Zone b) provides for eventual unificn c) doesn’t shut the

Sloganising p’essive democracy won’t get us home – unless we have

What we have is worst of both worlds. R. are pol. crucifying us by

is not enforcg. P. Decln.

J.B.H. Hope we don’t accept control thro’ Zone Commrs. of decentralised

central adminn - &amp; review level of industry if they don’t agree:

H.McN. E.B. must ride 3 horses not 2. Scheme wh. a) enables us to admin

door on R. &amp; French. Fr. have opposed pol. unificn: R. are

makg. econ. unificn impossible.

tools for econ. stability.

denying econ. unity to G. Declare, if you like, that it’s R. wh.

This is a temporising policy.

Provinces – w’out control at centre. Must go on pressing for

cd. also export high-priced commies vice low price coal.

2. Food Supplies for Germany.

P.M. Referred to facts. Read telegram from Ripman to Turner.

Prev. posn. Given 200.000 t. (mainly to UNRRA): have made further

economies: &amp; acc. to M/F. shall only just get thro’ even if we get

M’while U.S. disposed to send what they have elsewhere than to

Austr. &amp; Canada sendg. all they can to L.F.C. countries.

W’ton Tel. 2850.

U.K. supplies from U.S.A. &amp; collect early harvest.

L.F.C. countries.

B.S. Recent figures of allocations. Not understood.

U.S. determined that India &amp; G. shall be supplied fr. U.K. sources.

Latest figures of stocks.

My concln: we can’t afford to send any more abroad. Can’t divert

177

any more coarse grains because of effect on our livestock. May

have to make further cuts in animal foods.

Read out advice from Rank.

P.M. Ital. Tel. 2861, on the other hand.

If we do nothing, we shall have intolerable pressure – if we get nothg.

for G. and have it forced out of us.

What of barley saved by beer cut.

J.B.H. Requirements of B. Zone of Germany:-

150.000 t. during May to m’tain distribn in June.

185.000 t. .. June .. .. .. July.

170.000 t. .. July August. G. harvest

coming in.

120.000 t. .. August Sept.

30/50.000 t. .. Sept.

675.000 t. in 5 months.

Supply: only 20.000 fr. U.S.A., included in above figure.

If pooling adopted, a much higher share wd. come to B. Zone. –

92.000 t. out of total allocn for Germany.

T.W. U.S. persist in believing we have large stocks.

Whenever we make consumptn economies, they at once ask who can

have the savings.

Can’t we make U.S. realise what our stock posn is. P.M. Give them the facts re our stocks &amp; needs: put the posn in B. Zone:

Full factual statement – for commn by me to Truman.

and face them with the situation. If our assumptns go astray,

we may be in comparable posn.

N.B. Vital pt: U.S. view of our stock posn. Cl. And. will decide: he

believes tht. at our worst we shall have 10 wks. stock &amp; thinks

we cd. with 8. What he is after is an offer v. guarantee of

replacemt. in Aug/Sept. Offer that.

Shd. also press for pooling in 3 Western Zones.

P.M. Shd. say also tht. India shd. have same priority as Japan for F/East.

supplies.

E.Sh. Have got nowhere with telegrams. Wd. it not be better for senior

Minister (e.g. L.P.) to go out &amp; put it in person?

A.B. &amp;

C.E. Agreed.

H.M. Instinct – tempy diversion v. guarantees. – Authd to deal on this basis:

no offer in advance.

Prob. right line is to have a good row with U.S. first. May I be free to

do this.

178

A.B. ? Publish abridged version of Robertson’s report.

P.M. Facts perhaps – not his report. Cab. Off. to co-ordinate prepn of brief

Agreed: H.M. to go on Mission to Truman.

for H.M.
