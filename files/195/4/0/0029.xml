C.M. 41 (46) 3rd May, 1946

1. United States Request for Bases: Tarawa.

P.M. Tel. from E.B. – suggesting immed. cession of Tarawa, as war memorial to

U.S.

b) must ask H.M.

G.H. Surrender w’out consultn of 3.000 inhab. And at their request tht G. Islands

were annexed.

Marines who made gallant exploit then – to influence loan.

Diffies a) no consultn with intell. inhabitants.

E.B. wants it for Loan. But (iii) wd. it affect that (ii) wd. it not look like cession

Austr &amp; N.Z. were opposed because awkward precedent.

Don’t recommend agreemt.

Sympathy re sentiment: for U.S. lost many men here. But can’t do it w’out consultn.

A. Tall order, at short notice. And quid for the quo not guaranteed. Wdn’t do it for Loan.

Shdn’t be unreasonable.

H.D. Discounted optimism re

But a) shdn’t be done save as part of genl. plan for bases.

b) can’t do it w’out consultg. A &amp; N.Z.

P.M. Wd. consult them if Cab. favoured cession.

A.B. No cession of B. territory by unilateral action or otherwise than thro’ U.N.O. or as part of general defence scheme.

Loan. Important to get it. And if this were

effective way of getting it, much to be said for it. But danger of

defeatg. own object.

x/ Wd. prefer to put it that, if Loan granted, we shd. be more disposed to be

friendly re bases. Wdn’t offer it as open bribe.

But why not discuss with Doms. anyway.

P.M. Not if we reject Loan argument.

And B. has rejected our claim tht. bases be treated as part of genl. defence

plan.

H.M. Protest v. being rushed by E.B.

The telegram 53 fr. Paris will come to Dom. P.M.’s anyhow. Don’t want Tarawa to come to them in advance of that.

H.D. Wd. like early considn given to formula at x/.

Islands – must have considered policy determined at leisure. U.S. are treating A &amp; N.Z. with insufficient respect. B. is treating them as colonies.

166

cf. Para 13 of Tel. 53. B. shd. be knocked off this.

2.

Suspect a civil aviation interest in it, too.

Tell U.S. we are ready to discuss comprehensive plan, together with Doms. : but can’t give pieces away in a hurry like this.

We are in danger of looking “on the run” all round.

E.Sh. Wd. cut across principle of U.N.O.

Put the positive answer – not a mere negative.

N.B. Agree it wd. prob. have opp. effect on Loan.

But recognise under discn long time: U.S. want it &amp; wd apprecte it.

Reply: ready to consider in wider framework: but A &amp; N.Z. must be taken into consultn &amp; wishes of inhabitants shd. be ascertained.

Control in Germany. Publication of White Paper.

H.M. J.B.H. wants to publish W. Paper on Germany for H/C. debate next week.

If no objn by F.O. or C.O.S., cd. it be publd?

P.M. I shd. like to see.

H.D. Bad tactics to give away in advance.

P.M. Must come to Cab. Wd. it be wise anyway: might reflect on ques. now being considered in Paris.

O.S. Haven’t studied it.

P.M. Let J.B.W. tell his story in his speech.

No publication.
