C.M. 96 (46) 14th November, 1946

1. Parliament [Enter W.W.

[Enter: H.McN., O.S.

2. Egypt

Business for next week.

P.M. P.Q. by Edelman. Read draft answer. Approved.

Stansgate P.M. Seems that Sidky will accept proposals – possibly over week-end.

Letter fr. Govr. Genl. who is distressed over it.

Telegram 2079 to E.B. Reply to this read to Cabinet. (1613 Washington)

Govr. Genl. has v. gt. influence in Sudan. But they are not susceptible to

argument over Egypt.

S. Deprecate debate in H/C. to-day on Egypt.

Disclosures have, however, upset Sudan. Govr. Genl. apptd by King/Egypt with our consent: E. flag is flown: E. troops have bn. there. But the adminn have played down E. counn so much tht. Sudanese will be shocked by Protocol. Trouble expected: administrators (Sud. &amp; Br.) may resign: may be bloodshed.

Letter from Govr. Genl. to P.M. of 10/11 read to Cabinet.

“Enforce the Protocol”. Nothing to enforce, save law &amp; order, which isn’t in the Protocol.

Egypt Parlt. meets to-day. King will spk. re Treaty. To-morrow, day of Prayer, Priests will speak of it. Sat/Sunday the Delegation are expected to confirm. If we get thro’ to Monday, we are home. O.S. A.E. on 2nd thoughts has decided to say nothing requiring an answer.

P.M. Have kept A.E. informed. He will say no more than “no change in sovereignty or adminn”. &amp; we will say “that is so.”

H.M. Pity to flout the Sudanese, who like us, for the sake of the Egyptians, who don’t.

R.S.C. Cd. we get some Sudanese leaders over here? Talk to them &amp; sooth them.

H.McN. Can’t announce such an invitation before Eg. crisis is over.

R.S.C. Get the invitn in train., before an explosion occurs in Sudan.

Agreed: subject is timing.

A.V.A. Send to Govr. Genl. our 4 points.

P.M. Agreed: separate letter.

398

R.S.C. Another letter to Govr. Genl. which can be shown to leading Sudanese –

P.M. Must go off. at once – I will sign.

[Exit: Stansgate,

H.McN., O.S.

Barnes.

3.

indicatg. tht. H.M.G. have considered his is repns &amp; their posn is safeguarded.

O.S. In train. for E.B.’s signature.

[Enter: Wilmot &amp;

Transport Bill. J. Clause 18. If Co. exhausts assets by unauthd dividend, what happens to

compensn.

Agreed.

B. Clause 97. No chance of getting views of Rly. Unions. T.U.C. consent will

cover that?

P.M. Compensation terms. Leave to H.D. to settle: not for Cabinet.

H.D. M/T and I are agreed now. Guessing in City: need for early statement to

stop that.

B. Agreed.

“In Bill promised in speech it is intended to make proposals provision to

H/C as follows…”

H.D. explained. Objn w’drawn.

Clause 22. Agreed.

R.S.C.} Clause 28. Some provn is requd to authorise paymt. into court: interpleader:

J. } Suspense account: and let claimants argue it.

Agreed: Party Counsel to consider J’s point.

H.D. Clauses 83/85.

Clause 90.

Agreed to omit.

H.M. Yes.

H.D. Public statement in H/Commons.

399

P.L. Action re Local Loans has given trouble to trustees. They will also be troubled by this. Drop in income from e.g. rlwy Debs. This is unavoidable. But don’t add to that major grievance by being under generous as well.

H.D. I take that point.

Agreed: statement shd. be made.

Para. 3 of memo.

H.M. Para. 3 (a) – approved.

Para. 3 (b) – Hotels etc., shd. be divorced from rlway management. Good question to make special provision for appointment of Hotels Executive as soon as may be.

P.M. Cd. it be empowered to run hotels etc., at Civil airports?

B. Only if rlways have that power already.

P.M. Consider that.

R.S.C. Can restaurant car service be run separately from rlway operation?

B. No reason against it.

A.B. Why put this in Bill? Better to preserve flexibility. This is a machinery Bill – preserve administration elbow-room.

B. I wd. have preferred to keep myself free.

H.D. The other 3 are mentioned: if so, better name the 4th.

A. Cl. 5(3) gives power to establish another. Askg. for Parly. trouble to include specific reference: catering etc.

H.M. Want to be sure that hotels won’t be under the Rlway Executive.

A.B. Don’t mention any of the Executives.

P.M. They you give no picture of the organisation.

R.S.C. Will M/T. consult B/T. (tourism) re personnel?

Yes. Para. 3(b) approved.

H.M. Para. 3 (c) W. Elliot is running the idea that Sc. industries shd. be separately organised on nationalisation. Don’t want to give cause for complaint

400

by Sc. nationalists &amp; semi-nationalists. Wrong to have separate Sc. Advisory Cttees. Hence compromise proposed in Para. 3 (c).

J.W. Bill makes no provision for devolution in Scotland.

a) Shd. provide for a Scottish Divn of each Executive.

b) Shd. be a Scottish Advisory Council appointed by me &amp; M/T. jointly. Chairman a member of B. Transport Commn.

c) Scottish rpves on Board of Commn &amp; Executives.

d) a co-ordinating Commn (?)

Natn of transport in H. Islands. Raised at mtg. in April. No powers in fact included in Bill.

{Exit W.W.

Agreed.

B.

A.

B. This wd. mean re-casting whole Bill. England isn’t mentioned in Bill. Transport spans nationalist frontiers. No interference with existg. office organisation. You will have repve. institns in Scotland wh. you haven’t now. We shall take over rlway interest in steamer services to Islands.

P.M. Steamer services outside scope of Bill.

Bound to be at least 2 Divns. in Scotland: and in Wales. (N. &amp; S.)

Grouping must follow economic not national boundaries.

Support general idea of J.W.’s proposals.

Separate adminve organn for Scotland is admittedly necessary. Then say so in Bill. We had to give way on Civil Aviation Bill. Can’t ignore the nationalist sentiment. Don’t know what form it shd. take; but there shd. be some concession.

P.M. Formula of Para. 3(c) but adding “England”.

Otherwise, you imply this is a purely English Bill. Divisions will be made no doubt, but on functional basis.

H.M. On 2nd Rdg. Minister cd. explain regional set-up in Scotland &amp; Wales –

consultg. sys. on terms of statement.

P.M. In Cl. 6. use the phrase “take a/c of repn of various parts of U.K.”

Don’t want Para. 3(c) proposal because implies this is an English Bill.

R.S.C. In Cl. 3(i) for “G.B.” substitute “England, Scotland 7Wales”.

E.Sh. Won’t satisfy the nationalist demand.

Plus the proposal for Cl. 3.

H.D. Make the Cl. 3 alteration: &amp; reserve further concessions for Cttee.

Agreed: consider what alteration to make on that basis. 401

Transport Charges. B. State monopoly – must review rate structure: must announce some form,

rules, principles – at least on 1st round. Commn must pay its way: can’t

therefore revise rates until establd &amp; know where they are: then they

must review existg. rate structure: Minister wd. exercise supervision

thro’ power of direction. The Advisory Cttee apply a critical eye to

results. Then criteria for charges will stand for years.

H.M. Political considns – yes, but political pressures.

Don’t hamstring this machinery with Parly. control.

H.M. Whole structure of ratio for rlways in confusion because of bargains, statutes etc. And road rates are chaotic. There must be some new statement of general doctrine. This – the principles. Commn, with Advisory Cttee, will propose principles to Minister, who will submit to Parlt. in an order requiring aff. resolution. This must be confined to general principles. Order will require Commn to fix actual ration &amp; will appoint Tribunal as appeal tribunal.

Complex: but much history back of this. Also vast public monopoly: must be safeguards.

R.S.C. Shd. there be any principles at all? Tendency for 50yrs. to get away fr. principles (e.g. undue preference) in rlway rates. Main princ. = charge on cost or what traffic will bear. First wd. mean higher freights for coal &amp; steel. On 2nd basis you are in sphere of political considns. e.g. preferences to exports, agric. products (always given h’to). These ques. are nothg. to do with rlway rates. How lay down such principles in advance, when entering a planned economy. Better leave it all at large – subject to appeal on particular rate when fixed.

P.M. Then, if no principles, on what do you base an appeal?

R.S.C. That is the trouble. Too rigid.

R.S.C. Transport rates affect whole set up of industry. These organns can’t look at rates fr. angle of national economy: their concern is to make the rlways pay.

A.V.A. No Parly. share in rate fixing.

H.M. If Commn is to operate in acc. with a planned economy, who will give directions.

R.S.C. No genl. code of principle to guide Rlway Rates Tribunal.

B. Surely with public monopoly you can’t get away with existg. ch.

[Part here not heard]

402

R.S.C. Argued in favour of system of R. R. Tribunal. Risk of driving everyone into exceptional charges.

B. Represents 1/6th of workers. Danger of upsetting its economics.

R.S.C. Leave it all to Tribunal to work it out on common law basis.

A.V.A. Prefer procedure on lines of 1921 Act.

Agreed

P.M. Alternative: Commn acts on some principles formulated in light of Ministerial directions: Tribunal hears appeals.

R.S.C., H.D., H.M. P.M. S.O.C. Cttee + {A.V.A. to consider

4.

{ Jowitt.

Winter Fuel Supplies for Industry. 5.

E.Sh. Cd. present alternative scheme: for considn on Tuesday.

H.M. Wd. you not consult R.S.C.

E.Sh. No.

[Exit J.W. &amp; Barnes.

Licensing of Civic Restaurants.

H.M. These are family restaurants. Licensing wd. alter character. Wd. it be wiser to wait &amp; see how they develop?

J.S. Local option. Make it possible. Don’t handicap their development as v. competitors.

Memo. approved.
