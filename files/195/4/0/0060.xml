C.M. 81(46). 12th September, 1946.

1. Repatriation of German Prisoners.

A.G. As in memo.

Volunteers – will be met by scheme of deferment. Not wise to offer

addl. inducements to volunteer at this stage. Awkward also to

create separate privileged class of p.o.w.

Incentives – specl. attentn to d) and f) i.e. output bonus and sending

money home.

The latter – both re-settlement bonus &amp; also current remittances

subject to limit of 5/= a wk.

Announcement shd. go out to-night.

N. Agreed: means only 1/3rd value. If that rate is to be retained, the

x/ But in drawing off p.o.w. fwd. planning to ensure least poss.

Incentives: wd. have preferred somethg. like 15/= a week: esp. for

those coming fr. camps.

N. Gave assurances on x/ - save for the 8.000 “whites” who are going at

once.

C.E. Inducements: H.O. to be consulted on (h) p.14.

N. Yes.

H.D. Agree with proposals. Output bonus not to be available for

expenditure in U.K. – I accept on that condition.

G.T. Had hoped inducements wd. be higher.

N.E. At 15 R. to £1, the output bonus at 50% will not be sufficiently

attractive.

bonus shd. go to 15/=.

H.D. More concerned re rate of exchange than amount of bonus.

Agreed: output bonus to max. 15/=

P.M. You can say we shall take steps to m’tain labour force.

Exchange rate 15 to £1.

Draft of public announcement. Various amendments suggd &amp;

approved.

T.W. No reference to nos. remaining for ’47 harvest. Farmers will ask me.

May I say to organisations something to allay their fears?

[Exit N. de Freitas. N. Edwards. Summerskill. 319

2. Silver.

H.D. As in memo.

W’drawal will be gradual – spread over 20 years.

Token coin anyhow. Silver in it was originally only 1d per 1/=.

R.S.C. And put a 3d piece into silver series.

H.D. Will hold competn for design &amp; submit to a few Ministers.

R.S.C. Silver bullion for industry?

H.D. Govt. needn’t go on buying. Wd. be ordinary purchase, with licence.

We shd. cease buying at once when the Bill passed.

R.S.C. Can I start discussing with bullion brokers?

Legn: at end of this Session. 3. Squatters.

A.G. Yes: easier then than next.

G.H. Parallel action in Colonies. Agreed.

Memo. agreed.

Discussed plan to stir up feeling about housing – Ministers

Party whose fortunes are flagging.

But Dpts &amp; other owners are still not 100% good at makg. premises

Let this be focus for publicity.

C.E. Read Police report of mtg. with Communists &amp; Labour M.P.’s.

dilatory – in order to get popular platform for Communist

Police doing their best to thwart the operations.

secure.

A.B. Need for publicity – to get it across that squatters are jumping the

claim &amp; doing down those higher on the list.

P.M. Let M/H. send circular to l.a.’s warning them, in part, not to provide

facilities.
