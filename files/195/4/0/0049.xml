C.M. 63 (46) 1st July, 1946

1. Chiefs of Staff.

2. Italian Colonies

P.M. Welcomed Lord Montgomery on 1st appearance as C.I.G.S. .

Guts of it is in 287: &amp; vital thing is draft declaration.

N.B. Discussed in F.O. Better to accept this 1 yr. delay rather than delay Peace

Treaty.

Incorpn Eritrea.

Demilitarisation might be pressed strongly.

Attach importce to safeguard re

P.M. Telegrams 285, 286, 287.

Clear we can’t get U.K. mandate for Cyrenaica.

Independence wd. be strongly pressed for Cyrenaica &amp; Tripoli.

Wd. have open idea of United Somalia.

Above is forecast of U.N. Assembly line. adminn.

How wd. Doms, re-act to going to Assembly vice 21 nations? A.

Two suggns to make for mtg. this diffy. – later.

a) Art. 2 of declaration after 4 Powers insert “after consultn with

belligerent powers.”

In advance of that, however, no objn on mil. grds. to Art. 1 &amp; 2. On 3, we

don’t like Trusteeship because of admittg. Russia.

Para. 3 of 287 + 2 of decln. 4 Power decision – will cause diffy. with some Doms. certainly S.A. &amp; possibly A. &amp; N.Z. This wd. exclude Doms. entirely in wht. wd. be thght. high-handed way.

Smuts wrote 22.1.46: “preferable … arrangemt. as may be agreed betwn. action belligerents”.

Art. 3 make correspondg. addition.

P.M. But this is a draft for Article in Treaty &amp; as such will come to Peace Confce of 21.

The only diffy. = it advocates a solution wh. Doms. won’t like.

C.A.S. One aspect of Med. problem on wh. memo about to come to Def. Cttee.

Wd. want mil. facilities in Cyrenaica.

N.B. Won’t get it via trusteeship: might via independence: possibly thro’ incorpn in Egypt. Second, however, is the one to go for.

H.M. Worried. Can’t see any alternative, however. Palestine, Egypt…… losing mil. footholds in M/East. Also hope of Jewish settlement in Cyrenaica.

J. Show H.M.’s misgivings. Hopes held out …. e.g. in Egypt: but what has happened? Wd. prefer we shdn’t propose it.

263

H.D. Genl. atmosphere is better in Paris.

b) Repercussions on Italian opinion. Progressive forces there are beginning

to make headway – don’t want to discredit them at this stage.

P.M. On b) there cd. be no ques. of leaving colonies with Italy.

[H.D. Para. 1(a) of Tel. 286. Specifically leaves open the poss. of Italy being

trustee.

If A. persists, however, it wd. be possible to include reference to consultn

with belligerent powers in this draft.

P.M. But R. doesn’t like the 21. Insertg. them will damage this document as a

compromise device.

belligerents having their say.

N.B. Then worse alternatives will be put fwd. by others.

H.D. See x/. on para. 4 of Tel. 285.

P.M. And note tht. R. have given up claim to Dodecanese.

A.B. a) Failing 4 Power agreemt. reference to Assembly, does veto reply?

Mistake: this was U.S. scheme.]

N.B. In Italy Colonial policy has bn. controversial – Mussolini stunt, not a Liberal Party plank.

A. Cd. E.B. get Byrnes to put this forward?

N.B. Doms. can object to this draft at Peace Confce. If it were accepted, then during the year we wd. consult Doms. If it came in the end to Assembly, Doms. wd. be there.

Put it to E.B. on basis that he can drop it if he finds it embarrassing.

C.N.S. Wd. open door to R. saying we must consult Byelo-Russia.

J. Say also

Agreed: subject to informing E.B. (i) we wd. preferred

someone else to put it fwd. (ii) something about the 21

3. Trieste.

Telegrams 283 and 284 and 290 + paras. 5-6 of 288.

P.M. B’ground. M. weakening fr. 100% support of y. claims: &amp; in last few days has for 1st time seemed ready to consider an international solution.

E.B’s solution is in Tel. 290.

264

What will be the area? App. a buffer betwn. y. or Italy.

C.A.S. Nothing v. this. Watch, however, a) future of Pola. May mean retaining

troops.

C.I.G.S. Para. 4. We shdn’t be able to run down our troops in V.G. until U.N.O.

gendarmeries in being. Army cdn’t get down to end/46 ceiling, wh.

assumes 100% evacuation of V.G.

C.I.G.S. Want to keep U.S. troops there.

H.M. Don’t like this – artificial: cf. Danzig. Truth is Italy shd. have it. R. seem

to want to weaken Italy. Wish we cd. fight it out in favour of Italy.

P.M. This is v. sweeping. Hinterland is largely Slovena. Port served C. Europe

rather than Italy. Was handed to Italy as Austro-Hung. port.

T.W. Contains seeds of stable body.

J.J.L. Depends on spirit in wh. 4 Powers go into it. Can be success if they mean it

to be. Tangier worked well enough.

A.B. Gt. progress made, I agree. Ital. Socialists take enlightened views: don’t

oppose internatl regime bitterly. Agree with M., however, tht. 10%

limit wd. give them target for agitation. Support E.B. there.

We don’t defend that. We shd. however, suggest scheme wh. is

capable of modificn as time goes on with a view to enabling inhabitants

to have a voice in their own Govt. Provide for review of constitution

at given date.

P.M. Then constant pressure for power on behalf of one or other. Consititn can

P.M. Depends who will provide the troops.

J. Good solution of v. diff. problem.

We shd. encourage E.B. to proceed as he proposes.

Don’t however, agree with this adminve scheme. B.’s legist. council wd. have some authy. E.B.’s wd. give inhabitants no chance to operate democracy. always be modified. But under a time limit system people never get

down to working existing system.

H.D. See also (g), wh. lends itself to development.

T.W. And (K) too.

N.B. Pp 4-5 of 290. Meets A.B.’s points. Local popn will have a big influence.

E.B. has bn. the last to abandon the Italian claim. He is only asking for this authy. (290) now because persistence in Italian claim wd. break the Mtg. 265

This is modelled on Saar. But popn is mixed: port is not Italian port &amp;

everyone agrees it must be international. This is best place you cd.

find for an international regime.

This too will fail if U.N.O. begins to crumble.

{ Stress means of getting popn a voice.

Danzig &amp; Saar were well governed until L/N. began to crumble.

Agreed: Support E.B. {Abandon 10 year limit

4. C.F.M. Miscellaneous Points.

Danube – satisf.

Repns – we shd. stand out v. current prodn.

5. Palestine.

Telegram 1069 &amp; 1071 read out to Cabinet.

Connn betwn. Agency &amp; Hagana. High Commr. is clear there is

G.H. Jewish leaders flying from U.S. to Palestine.

Demand for deputn. such a

connn.: cf. his reply to our suggn tht. 2 of Agency leaders shdn’t be

arrested. We now have def. evidence of connn.

P.M. As soon as mil. opn is concluded, Agency can function again.

a) people

b)

C.I.G.S. Nil.

A.B. Had we not an understanding – incldg. supply of arms – tht. Hagana wd. cooperate

in defence of Palest.

C.I.G.S. In 1938-39 Jews were our Allies in fighting Arabs. Since then we haven’t

had dealings with them.

P.M. We did make arms available to Jews.

C.I.G.S. Not to Hagana.

A.B. But it isn’t therefore an armed pol.

C.I.G.S. Objectives:

documents. Future action must depend on examn of documents. No doubt of Agency’s connn with Hagana.

T.W. How far did B. troops co-operate with Hagana in war?

force.

J. Doesn’t alter the fact tht. we can’t have private Armies.

266

P.M. Nor the use made of the arms made available when, after the war, the more

extreme elements obtained control, &amp; used power for “next round.”

C.I.G.S. Terrorism &amp; Stern Gang, who owe no allegiance to anyone.

C.I.G.S. Hagana = Home Guard. Irgun = Regular Army.

A.B. Told Higher Arab Cttee met immediately after publn of Anglo. Am. Rpt: &amp;

decided tht. they wdn’t associate themselves with any violent or armed

resistance to implementn of Rpt. Is that true?

A.B. Shdn’t we enquire?

P.M. Statement must be made in H/C. To-day? After Ques.

Silverman M.P. will ask Riv. Notice Ques. = more adjournment.

[Enter J.S. &amp; W.W.

Agreed: P.M. to speak. Glt. to attend.

6. Bread Rationing Debate

Irgun, we believe is controlled by Agency.

G.H. Hagana has some (but varying) influence over Irgun.

G.H. Never heard so.

Draft read &amp; amended. P.M. to reply.

[Exeunt C.O.S.

If adjournment secured – Gvt. and P.M. to handle it.

P.M. Room for 2 speeches? One is enough.
