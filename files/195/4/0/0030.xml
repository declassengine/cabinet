C.M. 42(46). 6th May, 1946.

1. Egypt. Revision of Treaty.

P.M. Wd. help E.B. if announcemt. of our readiness to evacuate E. were

announced to-day.

Text agreed with Sidky. Read out text.

Omits reference to timing. Our view was we shd. take 5yrs. to

complete. Sidky says mention of that wd. destroy chance of

agreemt. D.P.M. nervous re implicn of getting out. P.Q.’s

likely re period: we shd. have to say that is matter for

negotiation.

E.B. wants early announcement to help him in CFM. discns in Paris.

H.M. Is there any written record that we assume it will take 5 yrs?

Awkward if E. repudiates it.

H.D. 5 years is too long: we shd. get out earlier. We are borrowing

money fr. E. to keep them there. Doubt if in next 5 yrs. we

shall need troops in E. There are alternative locns – Cyrenaica,

Kenya, Palestine.

No need therefore – indeed advantage – in not mentiong. period.

A. Last 2 lines of draft announcemt. D.P.M. were specially concerned

tht. we shd. get facilities for a base. Is there understanding

with Sidky tht. he will be easy on that?

P.M. Tel: 795 from Campbell. Don’t wait until announcemt. seems to be

forced out of us.

Egyptian Del. likely to say we can evacuate in less than 5 yrs.

Tel. 93 also. Tel. 803.

Impn tht. E. wish to reach agreement. E.Sh. We’ve bn. considerg. our oil posn – Persia. We regard Persian

(either of 2 foll. ways) our oil posn wd. be jeopardised: relying

J.J.L. We didn’t think originally of 5 yrs. – only sufft. time to w’draw in

orderly fashion.

Outrages v. B. troops. Shdn’t we at same time ask Sidky for

assurances of protn for our troops?

posn as more vulnerable than ever. If trouble broke out

on U.S. The Russians have managed while talking re w’drawal in getting partnership with Persia for exploitn of oil in N. Persia.

Our oil is in mid-Persia. We’ve agreed tht. U.S. may seek

concessions in S. Persia. We now think tht. because of

vulnerability of our mid-Persia oil we may have to revise our

attitude twds. U.S. concession in S. Persia.

My view therefore is we must be v. careful re M/East.

168

Highly dangerous to w’draw fr. Egypt w’out alternative location

because of vulnerability of our posn in Persia.

Shd. we not make it clear tht. we must have alternative location? creatg. good atmosphere for discussg. alternative facilities.

Only alternative is to fight it thro’.

Don’t be light-hearted re

P.M. We have done that – but we cdn’t make it a condn precedent.

Our advice is: tactical approach is say we are coming out, thus

A.B. Natural limit = time to establish alternative base elsewhere. That

is a sufficient safeguard.

H.M. Satisfied provided there is good understanding betwn. the parties –

preferably in writing. M/East. We may lose ground all round.

Cyrenaica, but what chance of getting it?

Understanding – all we can say is tht. this will make more likely a

Kenya not satisf. to C.O.S. Palestine a liability. Content with

Don’t be in too much of a hurry in giving away B. strategic interests.

P.M. But in default of agreement with Egypt, it will be a source of weakness

not strength.

favourable outcome of the negotiations re stages &amp; dates.

Agreed: Announce as proposed.

P.M. to mention to D.P.M. to-day.

2. Bases in Pacific.

P.M. Tel. 767 from E.B. in Paris.

Can I offer lease in perpetuity? Can’t prejudice our posn re other

Islands.

Byrnes won’t talk re genl. issue of defence in Pacific. This therefore

is all I can offer.

Cab. view v. influence on loan: see Halifax telegram expressg.

strong revulsion.

contrary view.

But D.P.M. v. unwilling to consider any island in isolation fr. genl.

issue. Unfortunately Evatt leaked to Press. And U.S. have taken

Tarawa. DPM. thght. it undesirable precedent on war memorial basis.

Also opposed to cession of this island. We also thght.

inhabitants shd. be consulted.

My impn – contrary to Byrnes – is tht. it is U.S. which are always

asking us.

A.B. No unilateral handing out of pieces of B. Empire.

If at all, on collective basis with a design behind it.

U.S. approachg. Austr. &amp; N.Z. w’out our knowledge. Can’t play one

off v. other.

169

Reaction on U.S.S.R. – will increase their suspicion, of U.K.-U.S.

ganging up.

H.D. Can’t believe Byrnes in Paris can affect loan in W’ton.

P.M. But it’s Truman’s opinion.

N.B. Tel. 53 – 2 Senators put down Motion on Bases. Hal. subsequent

telegram endorses Byrnes’ view.

E.Sh. How does U.S. request [affect] fit in with U.N. Charter? for loan.

J. Isn’t this appeasement?

P.M. We were ready to talk about bases as part of general defence scheme.

G.H. Cession isn’t easy. Not only Tarawa. For it’s adminve centre of

Gilberts, containg. 300.000 (tho’ only 3.000 in Tarawa itself).

Suggn now made in Congress tht. we shd. cede W. Indies in return

Doubt if we cd. cede w’out approval of Parlt.

But, on Evatt’s leak, U.S. have said they won’t talk re genl.

scheme.

This is now put fwd. as isolated gesture. Tarawa therefore is no more

than gesture.

I still doubt if world opinion wd. regard it as magnanimous gesture at

this stage – more likely to be thought a bribe for the Loan.

E.Sh. Formula? – open mind re cession, in considn of genl. discn on Pacific

defence.

P.M. We didn’t give a negative reply: we did make that contingent offer

to consider.

N.B. Agree – last minute cession now wdn’t produce right effect. Formula re lease for war memorial wd. be unobjectionable if any use.

P.M. Say – it wd. have bn. useful to loan if B. cd. have announced tht. genl.

Dugdale

3. Germany: White Paper on Work of Control Commission.

ques. of bases was going well. But we can’t concede Tarawa

ad hoc.

[Enter J.B.H.

N.B. Agree we can’t get this out before Debate. But some parts wh. cd.

usefully be publd later – cdn’t get into speech.

170

H.M. Consider later. Don’t agree now to publish after [Exit D.S. &amp; N.B.

another Debate.

4. Germany: Despatch of Families to B.A.O.R.

this debate – may provoke demand for

J.B.H. There are

J.J.L. S. Douglas asks for early decision because U.S. and R. already doing

the same.

security risks in next 6 wks. U.S. &amp; R. not affected by that

That, however, doesn’t affect need for startg. prepns.

J.B.H. E.W. has bn. consulted &amp; says she can provide them.

J.J.L. Once in 9 months.

P.M. Doubtful about sending children.

J.J.L. Wives already going out to Italy.

P.M. No objn to wives – object to children.

A.B. Cdn’t leave children behind for long.

P.M. Scheme needs further thought.

because their families there already.

J.W. Whence can we find the 120 odd teachers for Germany.

A.B. How often do men come home on leave?

A.B. a) Manuf. of furniture etc. I want the timber here.

b) L.a.’s cdn’t keep empty the houses left here. Row if they

requisitioned.

c) U.S.A. &amp; Russia much further away. Cdn’t we meet posn

by short leaves?

J.B.H. Mil. commrs. satisfied tht. we must allow this to some extent.

P.M. Shd. we send children to country where there may be disorder,

disease, famine.

E.Sh. Deal with this by increased passage entitlement. Wives going out for

visits &amp; men returning more often on leave.

H.D. Finance v. sketchy. Net cost in 1st year = £413.000.

171

J.J.L. Want to re-examine because figures have dropped by 33%.

Agreed: {L.P. to review with Service &amp; other Ministers

J.B.H. This is one of the headaches for staffing.

5. Parliament: Payment of Railway Fares to Peers.

{ concerned.

{ With special reference to risks to children.

{ Have F.O. considered effect on Germans.

[Exit J.B.H. &amp; Dugdale.

attend 25%.

A. Those who attend are recorded. Has bn. done for 2/3 yrs. for petrol

wdn’t get it. If there is abuse we can revise the arrangemt.

Never part of our p’mme to do anything for H/Lds. except abolish it.

Our Peers have no grievance – they knew what they were in for.

are devised.

Legn will be requd. Better do it with legn on H/C. alterations.

A.G. Two years since A. raised it. I was then satisf. there was a case for

A. Can be limited to regular attendants – as is issue of petrol coupons.

A.B. Agree in principle. But a) Test: have attended 25% or will

allowances. We know who they are. Occasional arrivals

H.M. Same opporties of abuse by Members of H/C.

V. little to ask as cpd. with what H/C. get.

Some Peers (includg. some Labour Peers) can’t easily pay own fares.

How will H/C. take it? H/Lds. is part of constitution: doing v. well.

Must let it work.

H.D. Have resisted this up to date.

P.M. Nor did our p’mme include increased salaries for M.P.’s.

H.D. Didn’t want this raised until M.P. salaries cleared.

I wd. have tried to head off S of S. for Doms. If Cab. want it,

I will bow to that – provided tht. reasonable safeguards

some recompense on hardship grds. But I wasn’t keen to take

initiative in H/C.

Satisfied myself it cd. be worked administratively to avoid abuse.

J. Several Peers, tho’ no grievance, suffer hardship.

C.E. Disagree. When we lose 2 bye-elections, the backwoodsmen will

turn up. We shall then be paying them for regular attendance.

P.M. Wdn’t they come at own expense? 172

C.E. May be. But why shd. we make it easier for them. I don’t favour

hereditary Chamber &amp; think we shd. do nothg. to make it work

easier. This proposal wdn’t live for 5 mins. in a Party mtg.

expense.

And those M.P.’s whom I’ve consulted are not of C.E.’s view.

leakage. A. to take the soundings.

A. Backwoodsmen will come when they think it necessary, at own

T.W. Supported memo.

J.W. .. ..

H.M. Parlim. discn in Party mtg. Before we say we’ve decided. Risk

Agreed: subject to reasonably satisfy. receptn of plan by

Party mtg.

6. National Industrial Conference. we tried to go further.

H.M. As in memo. This will be acceptable to parties concerned – trouble if

Para. 3. M/L. to initiate &amp; provide main Secretary. Might be another

from Cab. Office. “Officials might join” – includg. Econ Section.

Para. 5. If these can be brought in thro’ Confederation, it wd. be

preferable. Otherwise risk of “cross benches”.

Para. 7. If we got to wider commercial issues, we might either ask

F.B.I. to come or get their views thro’ B/T. Cttee on wh. they

are represented. Shd. offls. of T.U.C. &amp; Confedn be seen before offl. commn sent.

bn. thinking of w’drawg. fr. Confedn. That wd. be undesirable on

E.Sh. We have agreed in principle. But want to say that it offers no solution

Care over para. 8 (b). Mustn’t give too much. Wd. upset F.B.I.

G.A.I. Last point – cd. be done thro’ J.C.C. Will consider. Or see

F. Watson &amp; Citrine’s successor.

Para. 5. Important to get Co-ops. in with Confederation. They have

genl. grds. This may give chance to get genl. ques. put right.

to the problem of wage policy. Still believe full emplt. can’t be

secured w’out direction of labour &amp; wages policy. This Confce

will have to face those issues.

Also keep proper relation with Ministerial Steering Cttee.

H.D. Must be careful what we do with Econ. Survey vis-à-vis this

Conference.

173

H.M. Dilemma: to educate, they must have facts

give too much &amp; in trouble with Parlt. &amp; others (F.B.I.)

7. Legislative Programme.

Agreed.

H.M. Directive: no disclosure of forthcomg. legn w’out authy.

M/N.I. has announced there is to be a Bill (this Parlt.) re abolition of

poor law.

8. Cabinet Programme.

Can’t run the legve p’mme if Ministers act unilaterally in this way.

A.B. Payment of expenses of l.a. members. Urgent. Can it be taken

this week?

P.M. Yes.
