15/6 we shall know wtr. troops are comg. out of Danube Basin as

if all w’drawn fr. Austria. Must therefore be in posn then to say

a whole. Will be gt. relief, pol. &amp; financ., if they do. Austria

will be test case – no need of troops anywhere in S.E. Europe

we will w’draw fr. Greece.

Have bn. workg. for such a clearance, so as to limit intern. friction

Palestine.

to G. &amp; Japan.

Fr. have declined to join in supervn of plebiscite. And U.S. are

hovering: trying to keep them in.

Egypt.

E.B. Hear T.U.C. will co-operate in placing. That will help greatly.

G.A.I. Confirmed – agreed on Friday.

need for that purpose.

U.S. ships to move them fr. Italy. Awkward: U.N.O. attitude:

mercenary army at time of Treaty.

H.D. All cleared up. Troops on the move. References in Press.

E.B. I was to meet Anders to-morrow – then find it all in Observer &amp;

B.B.C. last night.

Was intending to delay announcemt. until Wed.

J.J.L. How did this leak?

205

Greece (contd). Suppose he gets a narrow majority? I took a v. strong line on this

A bad thing for our interventn if soon aftwds. he returned – v. wishes

Cannot some other influence be brght to bear on him?

responsible. I’ve asked him. He admits it’s not pleasant: but

story wtr, if elected, he will

A.B. Worried – Party will be restive. Disturbed at Fr. non co-opn.

Plebiscite coming v. early.

Cdn’t King be persuaded to w’draw?

in Opposn.

of a strong minority.

E.B. W’out civil war, King wd. never have returned. Comm. tactics

thinks he has a duty &amp; can’t let his followers down. Another return.

now. If both cd. be disarmed, you wd. have a fair plebiscite –

German War Memorials.

On voting for elections, he won’t get back.

N.B. Fundamental problem: to restore order. Both sides provoking disorder

and no majority for King.

A.B. Can’t we secure a big contrary poll?

E.B. Will keep my eye on this.

Nathan said – not intended to destroy those of artistic merit etc.

Item 2 on Agenda.

2. Man Power. Call-up for Forces.

P.M. As in brief.

Difficulty: must keep some men in for as much as 4 years when new

entrants can’t be kept for more than 2 yrs.

E.B. Considered many alternatives on M.P. Cttee. Whatever you do. you

mitigate by adminve measures: can’t meet it by genl. rule. This

have an overlap on transfer to fixed period of service. Can

plan is best we can do.

206

Figures in Scheme D. have bn. cut. Depends on services now run by

W.O. being assisted by other 2 Services. My caveat shd. be clearly stated. Demobn may have to be slowed

down at end/year so tht. our foreign policy may be backed if

it turns out tht. no genl. clearance of troops fr. S.E. Europe.

Teeth &amp; tail once more.

G.A.I. a) Call-up for 2 yrs: but then 18 mos.

appr. completed.

at end/46 it wd. be gt. relief.

of criticism.

b) Apprentices: after end/47 will have option of deferment until

If services, by using more women, cd. give this option

The 2 yr. period is likely to be accepted: appr. will be point

c) Poss. of indir. servg. up to 4½ yrs. But even so will be out before any of the new 2 yr. men.

B/T. Vitally import. to protect apprentices even in 1947. Not only for econ.

outset for deferring men w’in 9 mos. or so of end of

Hope scheme will not be regarded as final. Wd. like it open to review.

greatest.

E.W. Para. 9(c) on p. 4. Will further weaken Arts side. Omit the word

apprentices – w’in. few months of completion.

T.W. V. few Arts students.

C.E. Favour mil. service before University. c.f. lr. in Times to-day.

E.B. Call-up at 17 1/2: &amp; do mil. service first.

any flexibility, must be more strict: &amp; take more responsibility

Also care to prevent it havg. effect of prolonging service of men

J.J.L. Want flexibility in handling cases of men requd to serve 4 1/2 yrs. side

Para. 4(2) of memo. Want flexibility here too because Army behind

but for war pot. reasons. Ask for further considn of scheme fr.

apprenticeship.

It is in next 18-24 mos. tht. our econ. need for man-power will be

“Arts”.

J.W. 1947 is vital year for engineering. Want max. flexibility for

M/L. and Prod. Dpts. must watch creation of apprenticeships &amp; key

posts merely to evade mil. service. These Dpts., if allowed

in supportg. applns.

now in.

by side with 2 yr. new entrants.

other 2 Services in release groups.

Apprentices. Get better training in R.E.M.E. than in civil workshops.

G.A.I. T. Unions accept that.

207

decision not to specify Arts.

E.B. I have agreed to that.

situation warrants it or not.

On distribn. Admy. total is excessive.

longer.

Not satisfy. tht. man-power demands are based on searchg. estimate

man-power. Teeth &amp; tail.

wh. cd. be better done by civil units.

to deferments?

P.M. Yes: heading shd. be deferment.

E.Sh. b) No provn for opting for mining vice

J.J.L. Art students. Handle it round the table, not here.

E.W. Not askg. for more men. All I’m askg. is adherence to M.P. Cttee

H.D. Favour Scheme D as transitional measure. But gives 1 m. men at

end/47. This is too much. Want therefore flexibility in the sense

tht. this is no firm promise of 1 m. by end/47 – wtr. internatl

R.A.F. want to discuss ques. of smaller no. serving for

Apprentices. Why not from mid/1946 – for a small &amp; clearly defined

number.

A.B. Number is about 60,000 only. Overwhelmg. case for keeping them in

civil industry.

Shd. be reviewed by lay Cttee, not by soldiers. Common services

E.Sh. a) Para. 9. refce to apprentices. None in coal-mining. Does (a) refer

mil. service. Threat to

supply?

Once you start announcg. adminve accommns, you’ll get requests

E.B. b) was never in any scheme. Was always handled administratively,

betwn. the Dpts.

for similar treatmt. from other industries.

E.Sh. We can’t produce the goods w’out the men – can we then afford these

Remember we’re using more coal, gas &amp; electricity than ever

before.

P.M. You can’t think away foreign situation. Can’t disband our Forces yet.

But this is a transitional scheme. As internatl situation clears,

we may hope to reduce nos.

208

E.B. Remember end/last war. Short-term success at price of long term failure.

P.M. This memo. doesn’t commit us up to 1951. – only transitional

Accept Scheme D.

H.D. Subject to further enquiry to enable limited no. of apprentices to be

Exemptn for privileged class. Force employers to give proper training.

Also – unwilling to see experience of 1940 re-created.

call up for 47-48.

deferred from June ’46.

E.B. Not unless employers come down to 4 yr. apprenticeship.

Ready to have ques. studied – but on that basis. b) Deferment not exemptn: &amp; willing to make it depend on proper

J.W. a) Service in REME. is acceptable. It’s the others.

E.B. Does it cover veterinary students.

H.D. Yes.

One pt., discussed already with C/E. Distinctn of function as regds.

secondary school &amp; scholarship facilities: feel therefore

My comment restd therefore to recommn 32. But hope tht. in any 209

Willing to discuss with E.W. Leave it at that.
