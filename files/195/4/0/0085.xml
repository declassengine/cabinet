C.M. 106(46). 16th December, 1946.

1. Egypt. 2. Wheat Supplies.

O.S. New P.M: may enable us to escape deadlock on Treaty.

Not commd himself so far. Amb. going back to him in 2-3 days. J.S. Appln for 700.000 t. over crop year, made Sept., is dragging. –

Their p’mme announced for this quarter included nothing for us.

Telegrams from E.B. Assurances all will be well. Nothing definite.

Latest from E.B. – p’pone my leaving for 24 hrs.

I agree to p’pone 24 hrs.: P.M. message to go: can’t assent to longer

Otherwise cut in bread rationing.

J.S. True – overall: but cd. give us ours

U.S. p’mme.

Then found first quarter of ’47 about to be publd with nothing for us.

P.M. sanctioned by message of Thurs. to Cl. Anderson – threatening

to come over in person. Nuisance value.

Cab. mtgs in W’ton on this Mon. &amp; Tuesd.

Message from P.M. to President.

p’ponement.

150.000 t. must arrive in U.K. by end/Jan. Shipment to start at once.

P.M. Byrnes says transport. Is that so?

, at expense of other countries.

And even then a softer message than draft submd by J.S.

if unfavourable P.M. to send message to Truman.

(or when necessary to arrive Thursday)

3. Clothes Rationing.

H.M. Deadline – Wed. night. Gives Byrnes a chance w’out crossing wires.

P.M. Don’t go until you know what happened at to-day’s Cabinet.

No message until we know that result.

Agreed: await result of W’ton Cab. to-day.

.. .. J.S. to leave on Wed. night.

P.M. to fix details. [Exit O.S.

R.S.C. a) home &amp; export b) division w’in exports.

consider &amp; report to Cab. if necessary.

b) is less urgent. Am ready to refer it to Cttee of officials to

446

Main point. Oct/Dec. ’46 95.400 t. estimated. 90.000 realised

because cut hours. Next period. 87.500 t. estimated because cut hours:

Fixed: industrial, Govt-supplies. Leaves home (clothg. &amp; household)

ration = equivalent 1 coupon p. hd. Thus increase of 2 wd. be

Supplementaries = 8 p. head over population. Harder cases.

Want to announce 32 and

fuel: low output months.

&amp; exports. Can’t reduce ration 1 yr. after war. Will put sheets on

v. little increase.

Propose to go to 32. Hope 34 in Sept. But only by reducg. exports.

26.200 allocated: 22.000 realised: last period. Next propose 15.000. cut in exports.

R.S.C. Reforms will take time: will have big results in the end. With

Redn of hours is unfortunate.

G.A.I. Elsewhere hasn’t reduced output.

R.S.C. Hope it mayn’t here. But wage rates assume reduced output.

R.S.C. No. And present sale of coupons shows it.

A.B. Action v. backward firms? Can we preserve a non-poisonous attitude.

E.Sh. But manning-up involves makg. industries more attractive. And

P.M. Trickle policy for exports wasteful if no hope of keeping the markets.

man-power as now we cd. equal pre-war output, thro’

modernisation.

Industry expects 6.3% reduction.

H.M. Intolerable tht. industry shd. reduce hours w’out knowledge of Govt.

G.A.I. 5 day wk. brings women back into industry – cuts other way.

E.W. Any unemployed women in Lancs?

G.A.I. No.

P.M. Pre-war consumption = coupon value.

A. Alarmed at condn of industry.

R.S.C. Have you read anything about it – e.g. Working Party Rpt.

Need for sense of service in people’s mind. Gt. responsibility

of this industry – yet unilateral redn of working hours.

R.S.C. And this was arranged on basis of no increase in output.

hours is one of means.

447

A.B. Repercussions. Other industries will do the same.

Hence need of wages policy.

2 shift.

E.Sh. Cut their raw materials.

R.S.C. Spinning = v. badly led by old gentlemen.

But Unions are as bad – conservative, fragmented.

G.A.I. No.

Football pools – high wages &amp; touting for labour from factories.

Women in textiles: concentrate on local appeals in textile areas.

for engineering.

R.S.C. 300.000 more in engineering} than pre-war.

Can’t expand engineering any more if we are to have any consumer

Must have balanced view of distn of our man power – can’t go on

appealing in all directions.

E.Sh. I agree: consider over-all: therefore don’t take isolated decision

to launch local appeals for cotton.

P.M. /x/ Let us see figures for flow of labour into unproductive industries?

Anyway time to stop the pools.

J. Believe country wd. stand for it.

A.B. a) First need is for directives to be given by Govt. on distn of man power.

Cotton has done it. Transport trying it. If we make some indies

R.S.C. c.f. luxury part of trade: 2 wks holiday abroad. Rayon: 37½ hrs. on

Trying to get a yarn industry, includg. the younger men.

All v. difficult. Progress is slow.

P.M. No notification to M/L or B/T. tht. hours were to be reduced?

Remember man-power short overall by ½ million. Scramble.

No right in M/L. to refuse applns for canvassers.

Press advertising &amp; appeals.

R.S.C. Cotton Board have done that.

P.M. Drawing off into unproductive emplt.

E.Sh. Against local appeals for cotton. In Lancs. women equally wanted

150.000 less in cotton }

goods, home or export. Value of textiles for export.

H.M. Need M/L. facilitate f. pools in search for labour.

Sellers market: no effective price control. Industries can reduce hours.

more attractive, we must say tht. others are attractive enough.

448

b) If you have background on a) you might be able to tell the country.

Cotton Exports.

H.M. Will come up on Econ. Survey.

P.M. Take it early in New Year.

in some overseas areas.

P.L. Burma not to be forgotten.

C.J. Cut in exports will have serious effects a) our food b) disturbance

R.S.C. Won’t come out in exports until June/Sept.

M’while may be somethg. out of Japan. And more from India.

1.700 tons for export is all you’d get out of 30 vice 32. Think some relief is essential for home market.

J.S. Can M/F. be repd on Cttee.

H.D. Don’t resist 32.

Until industry has bucked up.

Totally dissent from proposals for de-control. Canada: dollars,

R.S.C. Yes.

Don’t commit ourselves publicly to 34.

For export posn is v. serious. This is drift twds. rocks. Whole of

industry’s failure is thrown on exports.

food &amp; friends: surely shd. be at top of queue. Continued

allocn therefore and away from soft-currency countries outside the Empire.

What I want in allocn is 60% to Empire 40% hard currency

Latin America: a good market: hard currency food exporter.

countries &amp; nothing else.

P.M. Don’t be slap-dash. What of rice in SEA.

R.S.C. And future of export trade.

H.D. Restated broad principles.

Have we done enough to get imports. France e.g. shd. do better.

Monnet Plan assumes bigger textile output. Go back &amp; be

tough.

R.S.C. We have. Plan might materialise in ’48. Now they have nothing.

Domestic.

J.W. Separate domestic ration? To ease housewives.

449

R.S.C. Considered already &amp; rejected.

Cotton Industry.

H.M. Govt. shd. have known this was happening.

Hours reduced on basis of reduced output. Then they ask for

increase in price - &amp; get 80% of it.

This brings us up to ques. can we afford to be laissez faire.

Diffy. in honouring coupons. Tailors can’t get cloth for suits.

Despite the export arguments, public won’t like 32 + sheets –

especially before Xmas.

What did we do for coal. High-powered campaign to man it up.

Cdn’t more be done to put cotton on map.

If we go to H/C. w’out a plan for cotton, we shall be in trouble.

We’ve done somethg. with bldg. materials etc.

Have we done enough to let public opinion get mobilised v. cotton

includg. Trade Union.

P’pone announcement until after 2/1. M’while get a plan we can

announce at same time. Fr. Wms Cttee cd. look at it.

M/L. shdn’t generalise about effect of reduced hours on output.

Announcemt. now means export story will be elicited by Parlt.

A.V.A. Working Party Rpt. Scheme announced – with subsidy etc.

Short-term local appeals will cut across long-term plan.

Care in handling long-term p’mme.

New machinery for cotton will need all engineering labour available.

On announcemt.: let public know the facts. tho’ you cd. wait until

after Xmas.

Have drapery trade bn. consulted re working of a 32 basis with sheets.

R.S.C. Sheets aren’t free: they have bn. sold additional to docket-holders.

Timing: Plans for yarn must be made by 1/1. News will lead, anyway.

Always announced previously in H/C.

J. Industry shd. be assembled &amp; told effect of reduced hours.

R.S.C. Done so – 3 times.

H.M. a) Cd. O.R. be made to stop f. pools. J. to consider.

b) Can Fr. Wms Cttee advise on publicity for campaign …..

Agreed: Announce 32 in H/C. on Wednesday.

No public commitmt to 34 for next period.

Report fr. M/L. on flow to unprodive emplts:

a) above: report from Steering Cttee early in

new Year: also mid-week f’ball matches:

also b) above.

Circulate a Friday p.m. b’cast on F.ball Pools.

450

4. India. Believe P.L. will be cross-examined to-day as I was by W.S.C.

What is to be said of validity of this

P.L. Spkg. in H/Lds. to-day.

A.V.A. Concerned. P’gress in Constit. Assembly: not def. news.

Diff. to hold the position. Constituent Assembly.

And Nehru’s speech?

P.L. Shall say this was reply to W.S.C.’s provocative speech in H/C.

R.S.C. Private informn from India. Congress upset by refce to Fed. Ct.

Suggn tht. we proposed that. Wd. help if we made it clear we

meant to stand on our interpn. Rach…. believes if we did we cd.

force Congress to accept that.

Cd. P.L. make it clear we stand by our interpn. They can take it to Federal Ct. if they like.

P.L. The Ct. have said they won’t adjudicate unless parties say in advance

power to opt out of it after section &amp; before elections.

of group constitn]

A.V.A. We’ve said we wdn’t alter scheme of 16/5 save by agreemt. of both

Both sides must agree it.

they will accept our decision. If we &amp; Muslims won’t say that

in advance - &amp; we can’t – they won’t adjudicate anyhow.

R.S.C. Second point by R. Province shd. adopt the constitution &amp; have

We were not v. that: only v? [Province having right to opt out

parties. This is unilateral attempt to get us to alter.

R.S.C. That’s logical. But this is our diffy – they are bargaining for posn.
