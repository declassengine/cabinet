.M. 34 (46) 12th April, 1946

World Food Supplies: Allocations of Cereals.

P.M. Our offer puts us on good wicket pro tem. How keep the initiative?

B.S. My para. 2. MacIvor tells me Canada won’t shift 50.000 t. in each of 3 months. July-Sept. vice 200.000 assumed in para. 4.

Telegrams = panic, to prevent La Guardia resigning. If I’m to find wheat for any. why for U.N.R.R.A.? via Ceylon etc.

Guarantees from Truman – what are they worth? Given them twice already: and U.S. have fallen down. Promised 1M. in Apl: got 300.000 t. wheat and 200.000 &amp; flour only: they can’t now catch up on p’mme to June 30.

That’s why I say we are riskg. U.K. lives – it’s July-Sept. I’m concerned over. They can’t get June harvest over here in time.

Still I put a proposal. Resist loan to U.N.R.R.A. a)

b) U.S. Govt. shd. formally undertake repayment by 15/6. of total

amount lent.

c)

d)

c)

d)

Concurrently with offer to lend 50.000 a month for 2 months Apl/May raise extenn to 90% + 5% barley – saving 50.000 t p.m.

Repaymt. not to cause redn in U.K. allocation. So as to rebuild stocks.

U.S. to give formal pledge to ship in June &amp; July what we ask for not exceeding…. 600.000 t.

U.S. won’t pos. accept: but worth trying. Lend nil w’out acceptance of all condns.

As Tr. says 90 days’ shortage only – if true they cd. do it.

Canada’s failure means we may lose 700.000T.

{ 250.000 T to be saved by (a)

{ some may come out of Argentine.

{ Must recoup from U.S. – as in (d).

If further economies have to be made in U.K., will have to ration bread, cakes &amp; oatmeal. Ration of 11/2lbs p.wk. for sedentary worker. 7 categories: 3 months to do it: 10,000 staff!

Re x/ on para 2 of Huttons telegram. How can U.S. help?

a) Close futures markets &amp; take over on Govt. contracts.

b) Farmers to retain only 5% of millable wheat.

Requisition wholesalers stocks.

Cropping dirns for 80m acres next year &amp; full disclosure of figures.

P.M. What cd. U.S. do in practice to get wheat off farms? With their adminve price might be better incentive.

E.W. How much of this is due to L.G.’s vanity?

H.M. We cd. use his efforts – for we too are anxious to squeeze U.S. for our needs.

Halifax says some offer from us – if we are to retain initiative.

Period of danger – 160 days not go – until October.

126

With guarantees we might divert 10-12 cargoes. But not to U.N.R.R.A. countries. Say 4 to U.N.R.R.A: 4 to Germany: 4 to India &amp; S. Africa.

Conditions: (a) U.S. must at once take obvious steps of adjustg. prices so as to draw out wheat and stop feeding wheat to livestock. Duty to state this publicly: push U.S. into reversing their cereals policy.

(b) Emergency body – with full support – for world cereals can we make an offer &amp; push these conditions?

P.M. Wd. (a) in itself do the trick – w’out raising extraction rate &amp; diluting?

B.S. If (a) were done, yes. But they can’t stop feeding to cattle. They would have cattle dying on the hoof. – 174.000.000 bushels already taken from stock to keep them alive. And next year we wd. have no meat.

P.M. What about holding back on farms?

B.S. If $1.8b won’t get it out, what will? They cd. call in their agric. loans.

E.Sh. Isn’t it really a ques. of shocking U.S. public? Wdn’t L.G.’s resignation do that?

P.M. He wd. say we were at fault.

E.Sh. But we offered bread-rationing.

B.S. Read telephone message from Hutton.

We must make an offer for April if we are to keep initiative.

Can we contemplate reduction in stocks? Against dilution or increased extraction.

A.B. Must we raise extn rate even if we assume U.S. will keep their promises?

B.S. Yes – because of shortfall on Canadian supply; and to insure v. U.S. failure.

E.B. Stock figures don’t include stocks on farms &amp; distributed stocks. How much is there?

B.S. 2 wks. supply.

E.B. Believe there is more. Something like 4 wks.

B.S. No home supplies in August.

E.B. When do we start to draw in house stocks?

B.S. September.

E.B. Then no danger of starvation – if end/June we had 9.8 wks + distributed = 12 wks. That carries you to mid/September even if nothing is

127

imported. Then new harvest will come in. And new harvest from exporting countries.

A. How much does home supply cover?

B.S. Can’t answer.

To keep initiative, not too great a risk.

E.B. 331/3 % home supplies at peak of war. time extn &amp; dilution.

For negotiating – maintain end/June figure: but July/Sept. risk dropping to 8 weeks. And borrow that from current supplies. That wd. be a contn to pool, not to U.N.R.R.A. alone. i.e. a contribution of 200.000 over whole period – on condn of repayment before end/September.

A. Support E.B.

Don’t dilute with barley.

Believe much wheat on farms.

Take risk of 200.000 over period subject to condns of replenishment.

P.M. Conditions on lines of B.S. proposals. (w’out extrn &amp; dilution)

Offer 100.000 t. on those conditions. Firm guarantee by Truman of replacemt. w’in 90 days.

[Exit E.Sh.

Go into the pool – not to U.N.R.R.A. alone – [claim for Germany – no]

E.B. Say nothing to U.S. re raising our extraction rate.

P.M. Leave over domestic consequences.

Telegram from Halifax.
