C.M. 62 (46) 27th June, 1946

1. Payment of Loss of Remunerative Time: Health Service.

H.M. T. of r. shd. come to Cabinet. Composition too, I shd. have thought.

H.D. Ask only for authy. for M/H to table amendmt. takg. power to make genl. Regns.

Ques. what Regns shd. be can be considered later.

A.B. Cab. decision – Ty. Cttee and wider enquiry into main ques. For latter, composn &amp; t. of r. now settled.

H.D. I have taken a point on t. of r. Not settled yet.

H.M. On narrower point – amendmt. of Bill cd. await Rpt. Stage. My anxiety is re cumulation “expenses” – travelling, subsistence + loss of r. time. Might be open to abuse. Shd. 2nd &amp; 3rd be alternative, at choice of member? If you do this, how will you resist extension to l.a.’s generally. Read out terms of proposal amendment: to add “loss of remuneration time”

A.

Will try to get words makg. it quite clear tht. Regs. may prescribe

alternatives.

P.M. Those ques. will arise on form of Regns.

A.B. This has all bn. discussed before. There wd. have us trouble over Health bodies if it hadn’t bn. for Scottish differences. I therefore suggd only a Reg. making power, which prejudices nothg. At Rpt. stage the whole ques. wd. come up on its merits.

A. Where does this finish?

A.B. These words wd. enable you to provide tht. 3rd &amp; 2nd are alternative.

Must be able to do by Regns here what you decide by legn to do for l.a.’s generally after the enquiry.

H.M. Legn must follow that enquiry. Cdn’t you include in that legn provision covering these bodies. Soon after Health Service has come into operation.

“Compn in respect of expenses and, if necessary, loss of remuneration time”?

A.B. Anyway you can’t p’pone the issue because it arises acutely on Scottish Bill.

P.M. E.g. “or any one or more of them”. somethg. to show it isn’t necessarily all 3. Agreed.

Cttee of enquiry on general question.

H.D. Cab. decision doesn’t require this to come back.

258

2. Parliament

H.M. Is Grenfell the right Chairman?

P.M. Look into it – with H.M.

.

H.M. Business for next week.

Palestine: can’t make statement re action. Constitn posn: nothg. much to be

said: trying to expedite Grady’s arrival. Will ask W.S.C. to p’pone,

until next week.

[Enter N.B. &amp; Strachey

A. Want C. &amp; W’less before recess.

P.M. Burma Bill on 28/6. Have looked at it and don’t like it. Constitutional provisions e.g. nos. of upper House and property qualifications. We can accept some amendmts. on paper. Another point: no need to reduce age of franchise from 21 to 18. A.H. can handle it.

Senior Minister shd. be at hand – L.P.S. (Agreed)

H.M. Demands (poss.) for Debate. Bread rationing: on supply Day. India &amp; Palestine – will try to get them to take a Supply Day.

P.M. India must await return of Mission.

[Exit A.G.

A.B. All night sittings. Has result of poor attendance at Cttees. Defeated y’day on amendmt. wh. I cd. have defeated if better attendance.

H.D. Whips sh. be able to send Cttee members house to bed.

H.M. Next Session we mustn’t have 3 days a wk. on Standg. Cttee. This will mean a reduction in Legn P’mme.

[Exit A.B. &amp; W.W.

Also C. Aviation quickly. If I don’t get it until 18/7, I can’t get it thro’!

W.W. That is present plan: not going to finish in H/C until 12/7.

3. Bread Rationing.

But on examing. immed. stock posn (p.2) concluded risk is too great.

P.M. On details no diffce from earlier proposals. Single issue – yes or no.

J.S. Reluctantly recommend introdn on 21/7. Y’day on my return had hoped we might p’pone decn for 3 wks., for some world wide prospect of improving crops. 259

These figures assume full U.S. realisn of promises to H.M. Can’t expect them to do more. M/F. have be cautious re minimum stock level: but not to extent of 200,00 t.

P.M. Also relying on home harvest. What of weather?

T.W. Crops are good: but the harvest weather is the crux.

J.S. Wd. be reckless course not to ration at all. And if we are of that mind it is

weak to delay now Press are discussing etc.

T.W. If we can assume the 430.000 t. fr. U.S. Saving of 6% on rationing over 3

months is v. small. If therefore poss. tht. by end/Aug. we will be round

the corner, shd. we risk unpopularity for 6%?

How will that be controlled?

J.S. Scheme covers flour

Memo: approved – i.e. principle of rationing improved.

A.

J.S. You don’t eat 9!

Won’t have to amend (improve) draft statement: e.g. I wd. bring it out tht.

the manual workers are 9m.

P.M. Real object is control, not saving 6%.

J.S. Uncertain prospects of Argentine: no export licences being issued because adminn chaos (spoils system): unwise to rely on them at all.

A. Domestic bread making. Large recent increase in flour consumption.

Heavy manual: only 2/5ths above normal. Is that enough?

E.W. Will be outcry if housewives (who say they’re heavy workers) only get normal ration.

J.S. We tried more numerous categories: but concluded (T.U.C. agreeing) tht. it wd. be impracticable. Heavy workers = 6.m. + 3.m. women.

Meat increase – can be done on 21/7 vice Aug. (as in memo)

Advertising – as in memo. C.O.I. see our point, but want Cab. guidance.

Don’t ask for absolute priority.

H.M. Let me settle this – I will do my best for M/Food.

Agreed.

J.S. Announcement. Press say Cab. is discussing this a.m. – will anticipate decn to-night &amp; to-morrow. Shd. I therefore announce this p.m.

H.M. Ascertain fr. W.W. tht. no diffy. over other announcements.

260

Otherwise Agreed

[Exit T.W.

P.M. Will be announcement by me, Truman: M. King re end of C.F.B.

[Enter Listowel, W.W.

4. Broadcasting Policy

[Exit J.S.

again

.

H.M. Joint Sel. Cttee not right form

b) M.P.’s not best qualified to enquire.

Coal. Govt. enquired: took long time: only Br. Br. was against

monopoly.

Then they say – review for 1 or 2 years &amp; have enquiry m’while. But that

wd. be unsettling for B.B.C. - &amp; for their long-term problems.

I wd. prefer therefore to avoid enquiry: if our supporters can be held.

Press are unanimous in favour of enquiry.

a) wrong balance if H/Lds. included.

Some enquiry, at right moment, I wdn’t have opposed. But this is too late.

Raising it now leaves B.B.C. v. little time indeed.

Referred to occasions when W.S.C. refused enquiry. (during war).

We cd. say, let us review Charter &amp; see how we go. Have enquiry later.

L. Once renewed it must run to the end.

J. Why not renew for 5 years?

L. Support that: original 10 was because techn. advances might take place:

these were delayed by war: case now for letting it run for another 5 years &amp;

start enquiry after 4.

A. Believe there is a case for enquiry. Renew for 5 years: &amp; promise enquiry

starting next year.

H.D. Not so soon: begin after 3 or 31/2 years.

H.M. We said no enquiry in Feb. If challenged then we cd. have had enquiry.

P.M. Doubt if techn. ques. have much bearing on enquiry.

W. Paper might develop the idea of makg. Regions more autonomous.

L. Regions now have complete p’mme autonomy.

H.M. Might increase emphasis on this. But diffy. = Reg. can’t find enough quality.

261

Agreed: 5 years this time. Will see how it goes &amp; be ready to have

an enquiry. Don’t promise one definitely.

[Exit L., W.W.

5. Nationality of Married Women

.

C.E. As in memo. Referred to diffy. re children.

J. Referred to tradition of Fr. whores marrying B. subjects.

N.B. F.O. support.

P.M. India want to be repd at expert confce. Wait.

Agreed. 262
