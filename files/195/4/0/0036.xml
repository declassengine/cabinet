C.M. 48(46). 16th May, 1946.

1. Germany. Wd. favour following U.S. lead re

P.M. From brief. discontinuing dismantling.

H.D. These are v. re-assuring. Nothg. here re

H.D. Go on dismantling but stop despatching to U.S.S.R.

N.B. U.S. have stopped dismantling &amp; this is what E.B. wants to do. Of

plant dismantled 25% goes to Russia. The export/import

agreement has broken down. Every dismantling will reduce

exports fr. our Zone. That’s what we want. We shan’t gain

by continuing dismantling.

P.M. Only a standstill order.

E.W. Why punish ourselves – by stopping deliveries to U.K.

H.D. Do nothing wh. will prejudice our chances of getting.

P.M. Urgent point is that raised in Tel. 179.

E.E.B. read Tels. 179 and 185.

stopping dismantling.

H.D. Tel. 179: p.3.

N.B. But U.S. have stopped.

E.Sh. Tel 185. Is this consistent with our view re rubber-stamp Peace

Confce?

A. Yes: because not proposed C.F.M. shd. agree before it goes to

Confce.

P.M. Also proposed here they shall consult with other Govts. That is an

Shall we agree with E.B.

H.D. Yes: if warning given tht. it wd. be unfortunate if this involved

advantage.

further delay in getting some reparations for U.K. from Germany.

P.M. If U.S. suspend dismantling because R. declines this study, shall we

follow suit?

I think we shd.

E.Sh. We wd. lose more than U.S.

196

J.B.H. The U.S. threat is to stop the plant destined for Russia – the 25%.

Tel. 179. para. 2. Remind E.B. this shd. apply now. R. willing to

accept it for 1949.

P.M. ? Agree: subject to E.E.B.’s formula.

P.M. Also suggests we

A.B. Only makes verbal diffies for E.B. shall break Potsdam.

2. Parliament.

T.W. Underline last sentence but one of 185.

Agreed – plus formula. [Exit O.S. J.B.H.

[Enter W.W.

Bill – for Egypt.

Need to talk to E.B. Opposition might also talk to him.

A. Coal Bill to H/Lds. by ? -

[Exit N.B: W.W.

W.W. W.S.C. will ask for Supply Day on Tuesd. v. Cable &amp; W’less

Told them we can’t – Bill urgent &amp; hybrid.

P.M. Also E.B. returng. to-day. E.g. not in isoln. Genl. debate preferable.

Cabinet prob. Friday a.m.

W.W. Two-day debate on F.A. prov. arranged for followg. week.

W.W. 21/5.

A. Nat. Insurce?

W.W. 28/5.

[Enter B: B.S. : Belcher.

3. Railway Charges. Summd memo.

H.D. Have agreed to this. Not perfect. Needs £20 m. fr. Exchequer: can

Also meets c/living diffy.

G.A.I. Have you considered reflectn of higher coal price on food etc?

H.D. We will hold that.

B. Amendmt of original figures. Rlway. cos. estimates. Now amended –

receipts upwds. – eases posn. From £4.1m deficit to £1.m

balance (? credit).

face it for this year in view of saving on interest rates on natn.

197

B.S. On foods outside c/living range this will cause price increase.

T.W. Will cost £3/4 m. more to agriculture – in carriage of milk etc. deficit directly rather than subsidise increased costs here &amp;

Need to re-impose discipline of buyer over seller. Bad habits durg.

no redn ever in profit margins. Cause – sellers’ market.

E.Sh. Don’t like it: but will accept it if nothg. better can be devised.

A.B. Oppose this – on general principles. Simpler for Ty. to take

there.

war by wh. increased costs at once passed on to retail price –

V. dangerous qua inflation.

These are war charges. Ty. has bn. takg. £42 m. p.a. fr. rlways.

This repeats Ty. mistake of 1919. Deficits not properly carried.

This shd. now be used as a cushion.

Argument for doing this before natn is pure (?) politics. Cd. meet that by explaing. now there is this deficit under private ownership.

have to ask for review of house bldg. subsidy.

This is a genl. charge – opens way for increased costs all round. Shall

Look at this ques. not qua rlways only but qua genl. economic posn. betwn. freight &amp; passengers.

won’t continue.

Support temporary carriage of load by Ty.

G.A.I. C/living likely to go to 104. Another point &amp; we are at stage of

another cycle.

P.M. Only argument v. A.B.’s case is tht. we wd. have to increase rates on

No sufft. examn of real costs of rlways &amp; means of economising. Rash

C.E. Support A.B. The increased charges will be passed on with further

B/T. Complete agreement with A.B. This is prime charge on everythg.

entering into natl life. Effect on exports. At least differentiate

War costs of rlways – extra staff: makg. up pay of men in Services:

What economies can be made to offset.

automatic advances in many industries – wh. wd. start

natn.

to go into this w’out that examn.

A. Marquis of blders’ merchants. Were too high. Any control now?

increase.

J. Ty. proposal will cost as much. What are the figures?

H.D. Deficit of 42 m. will be covered by increases to extent of 22 m.

C.E. Some of 22 m. will be paid in increased food subsidy, anyhow.

198

B/T. Effect of 16 2/3 rds. increase in charges: we cd. carry 10% on domestic goods, but not more - &amp; that wd. affect c/living.

A.B. Natn not until 1948. Commodity market will have improved m’while.

That wd. have met some of to-day’s points. Then suggd some

But examn wd. follow.

of the genl. increase of costs. They can’t: transpt. costs are up

economies etc. Can’t accept other industries’ increased costs &amp;

Dangerous to bring whole of transport into area of subsidised services.

Another matter to bring a new range of services under subsidy.

increase them.

B. But will shake publ. confce more if another range brght. under subsidy.

pro tem. &amp; have detailed enquiry into relativities &amp; economies.

E.Sh. V. slippery slope.

Why treat transport utterly differently.

Certainly have examn into economies.

of getting relief on income tax.

Must get back to proper economic basis.

“Put it on passenger fares.” What about workman’s fares.

Esp. for natd industry. Others wd. demand subsidy.

J. Why not be content with increase of passenger fares &amp; economy

in adminn.

Easier to get posn straight later.

B. Remember my original proposal – give rlways target &amp; have examn.

arbitrary increase be made at once because deficit increasing.

Concerned because discn assumes tht. transport charges can be left out

by 70% over 1939. Can’t assume much of that can be cut out by

not admit transport’s.

Right for Ty. to increase existg. food subsidies to ease this posn.

162/3rds. is a v. warm breath of reality.

P.M. Ques. = timing.

B. This is right time because gets worse as time goes on.

B.S. Food subsidies = 4/10 p. head or 2/9 on income tax. And this plan will

P.M. Why not say – transition: prices not settled: wiser to carry this

Coal – prices were increased to consumer, not carried by subsidy.

Can’t get economy straight by going on subsidising.

But suppose 42 m. have to be taken on next Budget – what chance

B/T. say they cd. carry 10%. Look at that.

Suggest review – do it on this basis, but see what modificns can be

made as for coal.

H.D. Danger of subsidy-minded. 199

Must reject idea of takg. 42 m. on Ty. Proposal now is 20 m. on Ty.

I originally proposed increase for passenger fares. Why shdn’t

middle-class passengers pay more? Decide at least on increase

in pass. fares.

E.W. M-classes worse of than working classes.

Must make workers face the facts. Natd industries must live in a real

world.

I support M/T. memo.

G.A.I. Increase in rlway. fares will increase suspicion of workers re c/living

index.

Double outcry: v. increased fares and also v. c/living index.

T.W. But increase in Fares will have less effect on c/living than increase

Can’t expect to go on with fares below cost.

B. Can’t embark on policy of subsidising transport.

16 2/3 rds. increase will have to be made on both. Decision needed

goods – 10 or 12%.

P.M. Make the arbitrary increase 10%. Then examn.

E.Sh. ? Exempt workmens’ fares. Make them get up earlier?

Agreed

in freights.

Some adjustment therefore essential. Sooner or later more than

by Mon. if introduced 1/7. Ready to consider lower %age for

But Rates Tribunal will have to consider: and further increases

will have to come then.

Coal freights shd. stand at 8 1/3rd .

P.M. Yes.

G.A.I. Cd. then be investign into man-power on rlways.

B. Yes: that is my responsibility. I will enquire: &amp; submit rpt. to Cab.

P.M. Also submit to Cab. draft directive to Rlway Rates Tribunal.

B. Surely 16 2/3rds. for passengers. : 16 2/3rds. for passengers (as in memo)

[Exit B.

10% for freights.

4. India.

P.M. Read Index 38.
