C.M. 95 (46) 7th November, 1946

1. Food Situation in Germany.

H.D. Stated position in B. Zone. J.B.H. subsequently supplemented this.

J.S. Immediate need = disabuse U.S. mind on Canadian position. Their shipments to U.K. are slipping.

P.M. We must press U.S. – thro’ E.B. Also must see what guidance we can give to U.K. Press.

H.D. No real risk of public disorder.

A.B. Statement by B. official in G. tht. there wd. be diversion fr. U.K.

J.B.H. Direction issued after last mtg. of Cabinet. Sh-D. will look into this on return.

H.D. Cdn’t we educate the U.S. authies in G. re Canada. Douglas.

Sh.D. H’to we haven’t known the facts. Clear it in U.S. first, for it is thence it came.

J.S. I will communicate facts to C-in-C thro’ Control Office.

Cabinet took note.

[Exit J.B.H. &amp; Sh.

[Enter Listowel.

2. International Organisations.

H.M. Confusion of these organisations –

a) need of adequate Secretariat.

F.A.D. for practical purposes haven’t got beyond Hot Springs.

P.M. Endorsed this view. Time when I found so many Ministers away.

Interviewed to prevent Ministers going to U.N.E.S.C.O. - &amp; Tories

criticised that!

If you group together, it means U.S. V. heavy financial burden.

b) trying to do too much. Must get some priorities observed.

Summarised agencies estabd or proposed – let alone the Commns.

A.B. Fault lay, not in establishg. these, but in associatg. them with U.N.

Much to be said for internatl agencies at functional level viz. not with U.N. when they become playground for international politicians.

Don’t undervalue internatl mtgs. of technical experts. 394

H.McN. H.M. makes 2 pts. On a) I strongly agree. Want E.B. to say at U.N. it shd.

be limited. Also want to support permission to appoint apptmt of

Deputy Secretary Genl. Also warning tht. we are going to put in

memo. suggesting means of improvg. Secretariat.

On siting, Cab. did discuss in Nov. &amp; didn’t dissent fr. grouping. Common services: Ministers may cover more than one mtg. Wd. ask at least for delay on decision v. grouping.

Finance. Costly. But while it’s them U.S. will carry big share – at present

49% because dollar cost.

Too much in U.S. hands: may emphasise breach betw. E. &amp; West.

These are arguments for some agencies in Europe.

H.D. Always advocated U.N. in U.S. because m’taining U.S. interest.

No need for absolute principles.

Bank &amp; Fund: glad they are in W’ton. because Bank must raise dollars in

N. Yk.

Doesn’t occupy much Ministerial time. No confce until Sept. &amp; they

will then come to Ldn.

Cd. we review the agencies &amp; see which cd. be clipped. I wd. support

murder of F.A.O. – now that U.S. won’t play.

True we haven’t bn. successful in promoting centralisation.

P.M. Review in light of developmts. since Nov.

Danger of not internatl but under Eagles wing.

Doesn’t follow everything shd. be there.

Each case on merits. Strong case for having I.T.D. out of U.S. – to avoid comm. policy being discussed near U.S. pressure groups.

Want P.I.C.A.O. in Montreal – to secure Canadian interest.

Endorse McN.’s point on finance.

J.S. Short of world buffer stocks, F.A.O., is no practical use.

A.B. Discussed with Can. M.H. y’day siting of W.H.O. I favour not in U.S. For we are aiming at post. grad. schools in Ldn. – as centre for the world.

Can M/H. favoured Geneva. That wd. be preferable to U.S.

H.M. Siting implies a H.Q. staff. Not merely conferences.

a) don’t want political atmosphere.

But are arranging that.

G.A.I. I.L.D. want to leave U.S. Haven’t reached a decision finally. Reason:

losing support of smaller countries. Their next confce is to be at

Geneva.

L. Want U.P.U. &amp; I.T.U. to remain at Berne.

b) fear U.S. pressure groups – commercial.

c) want liaison with U.N.

A. Proliferation of Secretariats. Description by Cockram. 395

P.M. Circulate it.

Secretariats shd. be reduced. We shd. see report from Gladwyn Jebb:

&amp; take a line on this.

P.M. No general decision – either that all shd. go to U.S. or that some then leave U.S.

Certainly U.P.U. &amp; I.T.U. shd. stay at Beruc.

I.O.C. to make a report on the Secretariat. G.J.’s report as a basis &amp; Cockrams: working party under I.O.C.

H.A.M. F.A.O. &amp; I.T.O. shd. be together. But I.T.O. shd. not be in U.S.

Agreed.

A.B. No steps to site W.H.O. (if any) in U.S. Agreed.

3. Divorce.

No-one must advocate siting it in U.S. Agreed.

[Exit L., H.McN.,

H.A.M. 1945: 25.000 petns filed. 1946: 40,000 (estimated) 1947: 50,000.

J. 1) We must publish the Rpt.

2) Are we to implement it?

Compares with 800 when I was called to Bar!

Can’t cope with existg. Judge. power. This plan wd. enlist help of C. Count Judges sitting for this purpose as High Ct. Compromise. But supported by Bar, Law Society, Co. Ct. Judges, Labour Legal &amp; Parly. Group, Haldane Socy., L.C.J. (who wants to relieve K.B. Judges of this work). Believe Archb. Cantuar will support. Per contra, President of Divorce Ct. is strongly opposed. He admits supernum. Judges regud: he wants 6, to do whole time what 60 Co. Ct. Judges wd. do in 10% of their time. But a) don’t think any Judge shd. work only on divorce. b) Diffy. re accommn, lodging, marshals etc., avoided by using local Co. Ct. Judges. c) Hope this = temporary problem. 3 yr. job: what about pension at end? President’s scheme wd. involve using inferior Judge.

My scheme is cheaper: involves no legisln.

E.Sh. Underfunded cases only?

J. Mainly – see para. 3.

C.E. Support this as a compromise. May develop into a Co. Ct. jurisdnn: but only if experience supports that change.

J. If it works, I shan’t fill all accruing vacancies in Div. Div’n.

Agreed. Publish &amp; implement.

396

4. Exchange Control Bill.

H.D. Publicity. Shan’t have opportunity until I speak in debate on Address. Want to publish Bill before that. (Wed. next) Can I speak early in the debate? Wd. like to publish Bill on Wed. &amp; speak on Thurs.

H.M. Premature. Shan’t have a plan until Monday. The Opposn may table

amendment.

5. Princess Elizabeth: Twenty first Birthday.

H.D. Then may I publish on Wed. &amp; take a Press conference. Spkg. when convenient in the debate.

6.

P.M. Princess E. will soon become 21. No precedent for Parly. action – resoln or present. Suggest we don’t go by precedent. Suggn made by individual of nation-wide Fund.

C.E. Heir comes of age at 18. Can’t we say it’s all over?

General view of Cabinet: against nation-wide Fund.

P.M. Is there a case for a present by the Cabinet?

General view: leave it alone. later re-opened. Suggn made a dinner at No. 10, if b’day is to be celebrated. But on 21/4 she will be out of U.K.

Relief for Salford.

A.B. Floods at Salford. £200.000 damage to property etc.

Shdn’t we have an enquiry into Funds. e.g. Lord Mayor’s Fund etc.

P.M. Not wise to appear to be pinching charitable funds etc.

Wait until it’s raised by Private Members.

A.B. Can I inspire that?
