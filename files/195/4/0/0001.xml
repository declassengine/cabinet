C.M. 13 (46) (Contd) 7th February, 1946

4. Shipping in 1946

Barnes. As in memo.

Two points. Examine early in year – Admy &amp; I with M/L – whr we can reduce the 10% awaitg. or undergoing repair. /y.

Whether Service requirements can be reduced. Look at each ship &amp; see whr it is requd. i.e. onus on Service dept. to prove.

Coal in Scandinavia. If we hadn’t to bunker them we cd. bring in more cargoes.

U.S. Tonnage. Bland Bill now passed with no power to charter to foreigners. We are asked for shipping contn to U.N.R.R.A. pmmes. Involves chartering from U.S.

If we can’t charter, we shall be forced to consider purchase. I wd. recommend wholesale purchase only as last resort because repercussions on our own bldg. P’ramme &amp; wd. have us with obsolescent U.S. tonnage at period of keen competition.

P.M. Have asked Serv. Ministers to review their cargo shipping requirements.

S. That is in hand.

J.J.L. Less than 1/3 rd. of 1.8m to Service: not to our civil a/c.

Barnes. There is dual purpose use.

P.M. Use surpluses already abroad.

Fleet train in East?

C. Ld 314.000 q.r.t. is comg. down to 195,500 q.r.t. by June ’46. Total to be retd 500.000.

E.B. What do you want to keep 195,500 for?

P.M. Must be reduced. Object was no basis. But you’ve got the basis now.

E. Sh. How many ships used for S.E.A.

P.M. Leave that alone. x/ Let me have full &amp; early reports for Defence Cttee/x

S. Trooping. One of R.A.F. complts &amp; shortage of shipping. Air-trooping is reduced.

E.B. On y/ above, see whr. system of B/Adl. days has bn. stopped by wh. ships u’lessed repair needs before they came in &amp; repairs went on durg. unloading etc., 50% of repairs were done that way during war.

E.Sh And don’t put on too many frills in repairs.

2

C.Lord. Mtg. already laid on for next week.

R.S.C. Export p’mme concerned re tonnage &amp; even more re destinations. Orders are rising &amp; we fear hold-up on shipping. Esp. because so little storage.

Suggest high. level regular consultn with M/W.T. on export p’mme.

P.M. { Consultn between R.S.C., Barnes &amp; Wilmot on exports.

{ Consider if B. Smith shd. be brought in, to cover import conflicts.

E.B. Seek good contact with dock managers: for turn-around. Cttee. monthly mtgs. with Minister: need encouragement. Via reliance always on owners.

B.S. 400.000 t. short on refrigerated tonnage for ’46. Food waitg. for me in Australia. Wd. help v. much if services cd. release.

P.M. Take that up urgently with Services.

[Enter Winster. Exeunt Smith: C. Lord.

5. Civil Aviation

A. Explained points in his memo.

After consultg P.M. telegram sent to Delegation. No reply recd. But subject to satisfy. reply, recommend tht. this agreemt. be accepted.

Condn re pressure on Canada &amp; Newf. – reject.

Condn re spare parts. Para 4 (b).

Thought best tactics wd. be for H.M. Amb. to make repns to high authies in Washington.

Agreed { as regards change of gauge. As in Para. 3.

{ as in memo. Para. 4(a) and (b).

U.S. have now put up 3 more condns – even worse. Clear tht. agreemt. re bases is separate: shd. be handled separately. C. A. Cttee can now see draft of that agreemt. &amp; will hold early mtg. M’while wish our Delegn to be instructed to treat bases agreement as quite separate.

Read out draft telegram.

Also agreed.

R.S.C. Cd. Ld. Chanc. be added to C.A. Cttee for this?

P.M. Yes.

[Exeunt: remaining

invitees.

6. Greece: U.N.O. Discussions.

E.B. V. Authd by his Govt. to accept Stettinius’ draft. I told him we cdn’t agree to that.

Some difficulty with Chairman. A. helped – got High Commis. together to see whr. B. Comm. was solid behind me. It was. Spoke then to Makin &amp; got Brazley to coach him. He agreed.

Then Stettinius lined up with different – and worse - draft.

Chairman did produce his decln. V. objected: but was nervous. Interpreter muddled it: I asked for copy. Asked for adjournment to get certain that V. wouldn’t “edit” the verbatim rpt.

Greeks feared that if I pressed further it wdn’t help situation in Greece. Council ndn’t adopt procedure allowing a vote – i.e. wdn’t treat it as a dispute between U.K. &amp; Soviet.

After an hour’s thought, concluded I’d better not push it further. Bidault said afraid to go too far because of Communists in France.

Acted therefore as reported in Press.

Asked V. what he meant by “Greek ques. is closed”. He said “closed between our Govts.” Said he wd. go as far as he could.

P.M. E.B. deserves the thanks of the Cabinet.

7. Agricultural Wages.

T.W. Lrs. sent to Ag. Workers, Transport &amp; Farmers Unions. Offering help of M/L. conciln offr.

Farmers Union reply – willing if guarantee tht. cost will go on prices.

Ag. Workers – none of our Reg. Confcs have favoured grading.

No written reply from Transpt. &amp; Genl.

Have met Deptn of Govt. supporters. Dissatisfied with my answer. Stressed the importce of industry lookg. at graded wages.

M/L and I with Ch. Whip agreed to meet Food &amp; Ag. Cttee. of Party, &amp; told them so. They put Motion to Party Mtg. – w’drew it on condn we met them again tonight. They are now using food shortage as another reason for demanding higher wages. We cd. stand on present attitude. I cd. recommend another course.

G.A.I. thinks he cd. succeed in gettg. the industry together.

G.A.I. The letter sent assumed they wd. meet. I now suggest that I shd. call them together.

Then we can say we did our best.. And if they come together we cd. do something.

Possibly might have to accept some increase in minimum as face-saver.

My actions wd. be as conciliator.

T.W. If Cab. feel more must be done, get a P.Q. to effect, in view of world shortage wd. it be appropte for Ag. wages Bd. to take this into a/c as a factor. And I wd. say in reply “Yes”.

4

Quoted fr. &amp; t. of r. “after takg. into a/c general economic condns.”

R.S.C. That wd. be clear invitn to Board to raise wages because of shortage.

H.D. Cost of claim = £50M if whole cost passed on by farmers. We can’t tackle that.

Can’t farmers carry some of this?

E.B. Thousands are paying it already. And Farmers Union don’t take a/c of that in their price demands.

General feeling – against T.W. alternative.

5. (contd) Civil Aviation.

Read telegram from Washington. State Dpt. already agreed two

agreements must be handled separately.
