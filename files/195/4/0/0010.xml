In spite of Austr. views I wd. still give our repres there free hand to

y/ discuss with ref. to repns &amp; control. I wd. not tie them down to rigid prohibn to under 2.000 tones.

A. Austr. reply is not v. restrictive or precise. They are against big ships but await techn. advice on smaller bldg.

65

E.B. I was concerned to avoid our present troubles in Germany. Allow J. no

industry &amp; they will be a charge on us.

A.B. When do we get consultn before McArthur acts?

E.B. C. Commn is now establd: but only just getting under way.

Austr. is on it. Let whole ques. be examd. But add; “in determing.

x/ these issues it must be clear tht. we aren’t going to subsidise

Japan from B. Exchquer.” Whatever limitns imposed on their

industry we aren’t going to pay.

Austral. has a big voice on Commn: &amp; she won’t pay.

Japan must feed itself.

Agreed at x/.

A.V.A. Strengthened by Dom. support. Can’t w’draw my case.

Will study E.B.’s new facts.

Cd. we obtain views of C. C.O.S.

P.M. Good thing.

repns not objectionable now in view of world shortages.

E.B. As in memo. Agreed.

Noted that C/Duchy wd. not handle this.

Proposals to be commd to Dom. Govts.

[Re-enter Greenwood.

W.W.

6. Supply &amp; Transport Organisation.

C.E. If Cab. can approve principles we cd. proceed when T. Disputes Bill

is thro’.

P.M. How will you work last para.? 66

C.E. Dock strike. ??

A.B. Cttee were directed to establ. orgn. My view is we oughtn’t to do it

at all.

Such an organisation wd. be extravagant. If it were not, it wd. create

more pol. diffies than it’s worth.

I’m not prepd to defend this theoretical plan – M/H. wd. be the organn.

Cdn’t be done w’out Parlt. knowing. Playing with fire.

E.B. I helped to work this out in last war, when Gough’s Army was brkg.

And I watched it fr. the other side in 1926!

In strikes Govt. must not allow panic, or children or hospitals to suffer.

Don’t agree going to Unions &amp; employers. That wd. imply setting up

a strike-brkg. organisn. This must be offl. All you need do is

to prepare plans – no Union wd. object to that. Can be done

w’out publicity. It is a paper scheme – like the War Book.

Keep it on paper.

J. Prefer improvised scheme when need arises.

C.E. We thght. it might be more than strike-brkg. There might be trouble

with extreme right or left-wing movements.

H.M. Shoulder your responsibility as a Govt. or amend the Act of 1920.

You must be ready incldg. prepn of draft Regns. Object to discns

with employers &amp; Unions.

P.M. Alternative is to rely on Military in an emergency.

R.S.C. a) Do we accept the principles.

b) If so, does that involve consultn with Unions etc.

Reason was: wide Dpl. consultns wd. be followed by a

leak: &amp; awkward pol. re-actions wd. arise, unless we cd.

say we were acting with employers &amp; Unions.

b) is for Cab. But a) must be laid down clearly.

H.D. Overwhelmg. objn to consultn with Unions etc., or Regional offls.

Keep it to planning in W’hall.

P.M. H.Q. business: planning by high &amp; trusted officials: no consultn

with Regions. Sealed orders etc., need not be sent until

emergency is foreseen. There will be time.

A.B. I accept the Govt.’s response. for maintaining supplies etc.

But what use in planning for hypothetical situation. All depends on

what strike &amp; where etc.

Can’t conceal it if P.Q.’s asked.

P.M. Plans must be made: they are adaptable.

67

E.B. Plenty of warning when trouble is coming. Doesn’t happen so quickly

as R.S.C. suggested.

A.V.A. E.B.’s knowledge of Govt. machine (co-operatg. with Govt,) was what

made it easy for e.g. Co-op. to work during 1926.

No need to issue sealed orders until Precautionary Stage.

G.A.I. Must prepare some plan.

At one point I favoured consultn with Unions. On consn, don’t now

recommend it. Their Communists wd. blow it.

Unions have taken decns wh. will prevent their being dragged into

genl. strike.

Don’t print.

J.W. Cdn’t improvise at last moment. Need for emergency organn – in

skeleton form w’out diffused discussion.

Not only strikes. Political organisn might give us trouble.

We were in doubt on final para. Now favour no consultn.

E.W. Political honesty to our supporters requires that when we’ve made the

plan we shd. publish.

P.M. I wdn’t object to saying we had a plan – tho’ details shd. never be

publd.

Wdn’t say there was an organisation – a plan.

J.J.L. Agree there shd. be a plan: &amp; no publicity now. [Exit R.S.C. P.L.

But wdn’t we need military help? A.V.A.

The W.O. &amp; Commands wd. need to prepare.

They want to be brought in.

P.M. Not too much detail.

H.M. Volunteer no informn.

A.B. I don’t agree.

Agreed: prepare plan: no publicity: work at H.Q. only.

7. National Health Service.

A.B. As in memo.

No gt. opposn fr. l.a.’s expected. L.C.C. (best hosp. authy) have agreed

to support.

Total compensn £66 m. for practices will be criticised.

Payment for loss of remunerative time.

J.W. I wd. be met on last point by freedom to announce apptmt of Cttee.

A.G. Under Ty. chairmanship.

68

H.D. Agreed.

H.D. Want further consultn with Ty. { re financial clauses

{ re statements to be made re block

grant.

A.B. Be quick.

H.D. Today.

P.M. What about Parly. position?

H.M. Lucky that C &amp; B. Bill has dropped out.

Wdn’t be fatal if Sc. Bill didn’t pass.

Bills will be more controversial than A.B. implies. L.C.C. support is

reluctant &amp; given mainly out of loyalty to Govt.

Guillotine or allocn of time order will be required. But must allow

time for fair argument.

Our time-table suggests we might just manage it. Heathrow cd. go into

c/Av. Bill. Others (Annex III) might be endangered.

H.D. Exchange Control held back only because of loan discns. And must

pass then.

C &amp; Wireless – pledged. Ought to go thro’.

A. Doms. want that Bill. Cd. start in H/Lords.

H.M. T.W. concerned re Atomic Energy Bill.

P.M. x/ Carry over? Massacre of innocents argument doesn’t apply to

this Govt., which wants legisln.

A. Can H.M. and I concert re p’mme in the 2 Houses.

W.W. Want 2 mos.’ break. Want Bills to start in Lords. [Exit. E.Sh.

P.M. H.M. to consider x/.

A. Want to discuss with M/H. H/Lds. arguments re vol. hospitals.
