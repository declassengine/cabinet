C.M. 80(46). 9th September, 1946.

1. German Coal. proposal: cut 150.000 t. in Oct./Nov. and 350.000 t. p. month

2. Food Supplies.

P.M. Prospects of U.S. contn not good. Gist of E.B.’s telegram. U.S.

in next 4 months.

Hope Cab. will endorse.

Agreed.

(a) Bread Rationing.

introduced – supply posn is such. Can’t keep it on because not

P.M. Harvest in U.K: strikes in U.S. ports: not best time to remove BU’s.

J.S. Harvest worsened since my minute. No estimate of wheat we will

lose – told it won’t be large.

Over-riding consn: wdn’t now impose rationing if hadn’t bn.

certain of future position.

P.M. U.S. strikes might spread to Canada.

Two factors influenced me before

a) not ready to gamble on U.K. weather

b) risk of strikes on American seabord.

a) proved by events. b) U.S. posn might spread to Canada.

Wd. wish to have figures to show what wd. happen if certain supplies

not in.

How much of M/F. figures are stocks &amp; how much estimated arrivals?

Where wd. you be if no exports fr. N. America? to abolish BU’s at this

J.S. Run-down – breakdown in say 5 wks.

P.M. Importance of period before freeze-up.

T.W. Speculative prospects in U.K. Unless sun &amp; wind, shall lose quantity

&amp; mayn’t even get the 200.000 t. assumed for Sept. In Aug. got

60.000 out of estimate of 75.000.

Weight of harvest: if we cd. gather it’s over average for 10 yrs. past.

Can’t say how much we will get in.

Politically: harvest as it is, &amp; attracting such public attentn, fantastic moment. Shd. be asked – why we

can’t be replaced for some long term. Affectg. dairy cows as

imposed it.

Seriousness of foodstuffs posn &amp; its consequences. Livestock killed

well as pigs etc. If therefore we can abolish B.U.’s or shorten

ratio of extraction to 85%, I wd. much prefer the 2nd course.

This wd. cost 25.000 t. wheat a month. First wd. cost

40.000 tons.

My advice: defer abolishing B.U’s for a month: and reduce 313

extractn ratio.

P.M. How much do you expect to harvest in Sept., if weather remains as

now.

T.W. V. little. But with good weather (10 days) we’d get 200.000 t.

J.S. Rationing not going well. Public not minding: but not good morale

behind it &amp; much bread sold w’out coupons. Reaction on points

scheme. Bread saving is decreasing. As in memo. Further

week = 82. If it’s coming off this autumn, better do it soon.

But no strong feelings in favour of Sept. vice October.

P.M. Political effects. We decided to ration because of uncertainties in

P.M. This is inopportune time. Consider again in Oct.

supply posn.

One factor was home harvest. That has bn. reduced prob. &amp;

delayed. Second factor was shipping hold-ups. No assurance

that won’t spread to Canada.

J.S. Earlier Canadian harvest has increased U.K. stocks by 100.000.

E.B. Must take an early decision re extraction rate.

Prevent killing off of Xmas poultry. Politically unwise.

i) Millers shd. be told Govt. aim at de-rationing in Oct. (in confidence).

ii) .. .. .. .. .. .. lower extraction rate (I wd. prefer

80%) in October or even 85.000 tons

(para.10).

iii) .. .. .. to cut deliveries down to 90% to avoid waste by

bakers.

P.L. Risk of famine in India: serious to de-ration or reduce extractn at this moment because of effect on India. Take neither step at this

moment.

A.G. Think J.S. memo. unconvincing.

In B. &amp; U.S. zones, hope to m’tain 1550 calories p.d. (from U.S.

sources). Will absorb 50% of wheat surplus of U.S. By

mid ’47 may have to reduce that ration or supplement from here.

We are concerned to re-establish economy of B. zone. Can’t chance

redn of 1550 calories next spring. Bad politics to abolish BU’s

now with idea of re-introducing next spring.

Wd. like J.B.H. to be heard on this before decision taken.

A.B. Prefer to reduce extn rate to abolish rationing if any change to be made.

Political disadvantages of removing rationing – at beginning of what is

bound to be a v. diff. winter.

J.S. Adminve diffy. Not only for roundsmen, but also for M/F. machine. 314

They cd. of course continue for another 5 wks.

H.D. Extractn vice de-rationing a better method. Do that first, when time

comes to do either.

P’pone de-rationing until Oct.

But cd. we reduce extractn now by 5%? Cd. we get into confidl. talk

with millers. Enlist them on (iii) above against rebellious bakers.

E.Sh. Cdn’t abolish &amp; re-impose. Politically impossible.

No complaints re rationing in Scotland – or in my Ldn. home.

Situation in India &amp; in B. Zone.

Reduce extn rate by 5%. That wd. be popular. Rationing is not unpopular.

P.L. Spoiled grain fr. U.K. harvest wd. be available for animal feed.

Replace reducing extractn rate.

T.W. Wdn’t meet the case. Clear tht. much wd. be unmillable if bad

weather – but cdn’t bank on that as cure for our feed problem.

P.M. No decision to de-ration bread, at this time.

Agreed. Reduce extraction rate: 5% as soon as practicable.

No public indication of forthcoming de-rationing: tho’

no objn to mentioning (iii) to millers, saying they must do it if they want to get rid of rationing.

(b) Indian Requirements.

N. At P.M.’s request explained action taken by S.E.A.F. Cttee.

Effect, as in N.’s minute to P.M., on India &amp; Malaya.

P.L. Further telegram showing slight improvement as cpd. with figures in

2nd memo.

52.000 t. short in Sept/Oct. none the less: &amp; uncertainties due to

strikes will affect them even more.

Only contribn we can make is diversions of U.K. supplies.

J.S. Much done since last memo. month since a) U.S. Govt. have increased

by 120.000 t. this month’s shipments. b) Argentine: 140.000 t.

d) S.E.A.F. diversions. e) 35.000 t. of Canad. wheat already

maize export licences issued. c) Barley from Turkey.

diverted. We helped on a) – d). Gap much narrowed.

Diff. to divert more Canadian wheat. Asked for 40 m. bushels more

over crop year.

To ask now for more for India wd. damage our interest. Cdn’t

get more than 30/40.000 t. – wh. wdn’t make much difference

to India.

x/ Will do our best to snatch such other opportunities to help. x/

315

Barnes. I cd. only ship 50.000 t.

Not notified of more than 32.000 t. export licences fr. Argentine.

P.L. Thanks for past services. But I’m still short. 30/40.000 t. would

help.

G.H. SEAF. action has eased position in Ceylon &amp; Malaya.

P.M. Can’t do more than x/ for India, takg. a/c. of action

already taken.

Bring it up again if you must.

(c) Argentine.

H.D. Have said I’m ready to pay more for meat – on 2 yr. contract. So

long as kept separate fr. sterling balances.

Agreed. [Exit: Barnes, J.B. and Nathan.

Enter: Civil Lord.

2. British Nationality Law.

C.E. Pity Canada raised this at this stage.

Agreed as in Para. 18.

Edwards. Bearing on naval service.

a) Will lift the colour bar

b) Effect on Eire citizens who have given loyal service to R.N.

They won’t be able to continue entering R.N. if they’ve lost

B. nationty.

Consider Service Dpts. shd. be empowered to keep Conference

informed re consequences on Services.

Para. 18(1) agreed

.. 18(2) .. subject to G.H. considering title.

.. 18(3) ..

E.W. Para. 18(4). Wdn’t this force the issue? Might they not refuse?

C.E. We wd. take soundings &amp; wdn’t invite if we knew they wd. refuse.

Para. 18(4) agreed, on this understanding.

Para. 18(5) agreed.

A.G. Negotns may be protracted. Do you suppose legn this Session?

C.E. Doubtful. Will prob. take 12 months or so.

[Exit. Civil Lord.

3. Marriage Bar in Civil Service.

H.D. As in memo.

316

If you abolish, it wd. be v. diff. to avoid in practice continuance of

inefficient women in Service.

One of main objns to abolition is in G.P.O. – where workers are

opposed because of effect on promotion from routine duties.

Has bn. suggested we shd. proceed as in para. 5. On 5(a) I wd. instruct tht. bias shd. be in favour of keeping the

shortage.

woman on.

Recommend para. 5 at any rate as first step.

Must discuss with Staff Side before announced.

P.M. Not impressed with argument v. abolition, in present man-power

We’ve appealed to industry to keep women on: then State gives this

example, as an employer.

Para. 5(b) is invidious.

E.W. Cdn’t Dpts. secure resignation of those who are inefficient.

T.W. If para. 5(b) adopted, as automatic, danger of retaining inefficient.

E.Sh. You encourage living in sin, that’s all.

Does this apply to temporaries?

H.D. No.

E.B. How long will you m’tain freezing order? It should go. Unfair to

take advantage of a war.

P.L. Views of Assocns: any evce of views of women w’in those

Associations.

A.B. Room for favouritism, when rule is not automatic.

P.M. Position of woman whose husband dies w’in six months.

Risk tht. woman not allowed to continue will be branded as

inefficient.

H.D. Practice of other Govts. in App. And other employers in U.K.

E.Sh. Delay decision during man-power shortage?

A.B. Not impressed by G.P.O. view.

E.W. No credit fr. either side for this compromise.

P.M. Also will be said to be class-distinction.

E.B. Will it affect marriage-bar in Foreign Service?

H.D. No.

317

T.W. Wd. it affect absorption of temporaries?

E.E.B. Not to any appreciable extent.

Agreed: Abolish marriage-bar: Home Service only.

Not in Foreign Service.

Consider Colonial .. .

Consider means of removing inefficient after marriage. Tell Offl. Side before announced.

[Enter G.T. &amp; Shawcross.

4. Squatters.

G.T. Occupation of luxury flats on de-requisitioning.

P.M. What is the law?

H.Sh. Can sue in trespass &amp; demand possn. Might get interloc. for

A.B. Communists say they are going to put 10.000 members into this class

H.Sh. My advice is to start procdgs: try to get order: &amp; chance using force

imm. possn.

If not, go to trial - &amp; wait months. But 1.500 in one bldg.

They might disregard the court’s decision.

A.B. But this = organised attempt: entry by force: Police helped them in.

If I took such action cdn’t Police have stopped it.

H.Sh. Yes: conduct likely to lead to breach of the peace.

Crim. conspiracy prs. But fear jury wd. acquit. Positive there wd.

be worse.

of property. Govt. will be in hands of others soon.

H.Sh. You can’t re-enter by force, once the bldg. has bn. completely

occupied.

C.E. Criminal offences may be commd in the course of occupn: but

prosecution for those don’t give you possession.

in giving effect to it.

Can use force to prevent it. Can tell Police what is about to happen.

A.B. May I refuse to install facilities, cooking etc.

P.M. Yes.

H.Sh. I cd. consider crim. procgs. (with D of P.P.) but wdn’t give possn.

A.G. to consult with Ty. Solr. &amp; D.P.P.

H.O. to warn Police of forthcoming attempts.
