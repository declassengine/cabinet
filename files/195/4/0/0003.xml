 C.M. 15 (46) 14th February, 1946

1. Parliament

H.M. Food: to-day. Opposn think they shd. open – as they claimed it &amp; are critical.

Precedents in favour so is Speaker – Sorry because wanted B.S. to start clean.

P.M. In opposn we shd. have claimed it. Agreed concede.

2. Lord Mayor’s Dinner

P.M. Lord &amp; Lady Mayor wish Private Dinner 6/3 for members of Cab. &amp; wives.

3. Reform of House of Lords

P.M. Motion in H/Lds. by Cecil. We inclined to reject 1st &amp; 3rd proposals.

I have spoken to H. M. King. He took the view it was better to have it alone: and do nothing on any part of the proposals, incldg. the 2nd.

E.W. These arguments don’t apply to Peereses in own right.

P.M. But this Motion goes far beyond that…. made Peers.

A. Legn wd. be involved, even for “own right” point. – to declare tht. Sex Disqual. Removal Act doesn’t apply.

Thght. we were going to consider after Debate – we taking no line.

P.M. I told King so. But if you have to say anything, say we don’t want to do anything at all at present. I spoke to King on basis of motion on Paper.

A. Leave it to free vote: giving Cecil the hint to limit his Motion to “own right” cases. Will discuss with C. &amp; report to P.M.

4. Government Hospitality

P.M. A lot of entertainment for U.N.O. Cut down now on all large entertaing. for a time.

[Exit W.W. Enter J.W.

13

5. Select Committee on National Expenditure: Publication of Secret Reports.

H.M. Most rpts. publd: but understandg. with Cab. tht. when security involved rpt. wd. go to 8.M.

Tank Rpt. is real issue – Stokes has told me he won’t press for the others. Tank prodn is not a good story. Public interest in knowg. facts.

No security objn.

Ministers or offls. shdn’t be permanently protected fr. discs of their mistakes.

Diff. therefore to defend continued suppression.

Pros. &amp; cons. are in my memo. My judgement: publish, with W.S.C.’s memo.

If so, shd. we consult W.S.C. re publn of his memo. Shd. we be allowed to add: not if Sel. Cttee can’t add.

P.M. Diff. view. This was put up as secret &amp; replies so given.

If you want to bring out facts, have an enquiry.

Publn of these poor rpts wd. cause scandal: then you’d have to have enquiry.

These p. mortems do little good. Cf. Pearl Harbour. request re Singapore (endless chain). Strain on soldiers, offls. etc.

Can’t publish one w’out others.

J.W. Heavy arguments v reviving this controversy.

Rpts, made in confidence – worded as such.

Diversion of energy in makg. defence.

T.W. Stressed x/ in para. 7. Lessons for the future.

A.B. I was interested too. Tank prodn was disgraceful: not prepd to cover up W.S.C. Army now believes Stokes was right – wd. have saved many lives.

W.S.C. sells his speeches in S. Session to U.S. Press. Disgraceful procdg. Yet we are asked to resist publn.

E.Sh. We must remember – we can’t smear W.S.C. alone &amp; some members of our Party were members of Coalition Govt.

What cd. be said re other things. e.g. shipping.

I’ve bn. asked to publish my S. Session speeches: not going to.

If you provoke by this an attack on Coalition Govt. it won’t do us any good. I agree with M/Supply tht. this is not an appropriate time – we’ve enough on our plate w’out provoking a storm over this.

Argue with Stokes: can’t confine it to Tanks. Others interested in other things.

P.M. Much more to be said – if we have to defend our part in Coalition.

Bad for Country to get into p. mortem mood.

A. a) Can’t stop at publn of one.

14

b) Confidence: x/ in para. 7 If you start abusing that confidence you will destroy value for future of confidl. advice. Much wider issue than this range of reports.

J.J.L. Start on this &amp; endless &amp; indecision controversy will be provoked.

Involved lives – will stir up feelings of relicts. More damage than gain. even if Stokes &amp; A.B. were vindicated.

E.W. Over riding considn. Flak Cttee – gave pledge tht. confidence wd. be respected. Can’t go back on our pledges.

C.E. Members of Cttee have told me they wd. oppose publn of evidence – because pledge of secrecy. Publn shd. be confined to their report &amp; W.S.C. reply.

Cd. you resist pressure for publn of evce.

H.M. Think so.

R.S.C. Good reason to w’hold these while ban on S. Session remained. No security reason.

J. I wrote Rpt. on Aluminium &amp; wd. like it publd. The informn was given in confidence, but the confid. related to war situation only.

Don’t know why this is appropt time.

A.B. If you say politically embarrassing, I yield. Other reasons I don’t accept.

In last war everythg. was ventilated afterwards.

H.M. P.M. wd. no doubt defend a decn not to publish.

Need for good public reason for refusing.

With’held then because security. That doesn’t apply now. Serious matter for Govt. to w’hold.

Had contemplated only publn of Rpt and reply. Wd. resist demand for enquiry – even Parly. debate, this might have to consider latter on a Supply Day.

I believe Parlt. has the right to this information.

A.V.A. Repercussions might. have serious results on U.S. loan. Our situation caused hurried acquisition of Shearmans etc., Inadvisable therefore to publish at present.

Can’t prevent Conser. fr. pressg. for other Rpts. if they see Party advantage in it.

H.D. Favour publn – but not at present. Enough to do. Wait at least until W.S.C. is back &amp; notify him in advance of publn.

P.M. Certainly W.S.C. is entitled to be consulted.

A.G. In favour of publn because inalienable rights of Parliament.

15

Postpone decision – for a month.

[Exit Wilmot

[Enter Barnes &amp; Hynd

6. German Fleet: Report of Naval Commission

A.V.A. Para. 6 (i). Note from E.B. recommending we shd. not now do this. We have since learnt tht. U.S. &amp; Sov. Govt. have already taken unilateral action &amp; are unlikely to make this request to French. No need therefore to make a reservation on this. i.e. Reservations as on p.q. and no more.

Signal to-day re attitude of R. Repves. B. responsible for all mistakes, all transfer ….. No co-opn from them.

T.W. Trawlers?

H.D. Support this Rpt. Floating docks worth almost all the rest.

J.B.H. Annex D. para. 3. Wd. like this to provide for perm intentn of some for repairs of other countries’ ships &amp; tempy retentn others for repair p’mme.

Mentioned in para 6 (2) but not made clear in Annex.

Can wording be re-considered betwn. Admy. &amp; Control Office.

H.D. Supply covered already. Barnes &amp; A.V.A. agreed. Let it ride.

Agreed. [Exit Hynd:

[Enter Tomlinson

7. German Prisoners of War

G.A.I. Corrected figures in para. 2. get them here

Diffy. with F.O. over Norway. Can’t do/ it until May.

I agree with F.O. As so late in comg. here, don’t think they’re worth having.

Agreed: clear them from Norway, even tho’ not into U.K.

Addn to para. 5 (2)

Present Cttee large enough – will co-opt other Dpts as requd.

P.M. Use of Poles?

G.A.I. H.O. difficulties. No condns requiring them to stay on the job.

H.D. £2.3M a month on Poles. Why can’t we get them to work.

E.Sh. Confce this wk.

16

a) willing?

b) Can we use

c) Will N.U.M. agree?

We are getting informn on a). Might avoid c).

J.J.L. Strong adverse publ. opinion v. permanent settlement.

C.E. Supported that fr. H.O. pt. view.

P.M. No suggn of permanent establmnt.

E.Sh. May have to keep them for long time because if you employ at all it affects recruitment. Cd. only absorb v. small nos., in practice.

C.E. Trouble with members of other Allied Armies, who want to settle here.

P.M. Review on basis of man-power shortage.

A.B. Mad situation. Deficit of 1.3M. Yet. H.O. fear immigration. Why?

E.Sh. Where cd. we house them? N.U.M. also must be handled v. carefully.

P.M. Ques. is whr by sensible means we can make use of foreign labour, Poles in particular.

H.M. Pol. diffies in absorbg. large foreign popn. Different if we do it temporarily. Don’t be blackmailed by the cost. I wd. be ready to give notice tht. no more pay wd. be given after a month.

Agreed: { Enquiry by Ministers correspondg. to P.O.W. Allocn

{ Cttee: foreign labour, particularly Poles.

T.W. Ital. p.o.w. are leavg. And I’m seekg. to increase cereals acreage. Hope therefore tht. max. no. of Germans will be allocd to agr.

G.A.I. We have about 70.000 more, than we expected, to allocate.

J.W. Para. 6. I want specl. priority.

P.M. No absolute priority – you’re already at head of queue.

S. In para. 5 – no refce now to removal of Defence works. We’ve bid for 30.000. We guard &amp; house them: hard if we don’t get our share. Ask therefore that priorities 1-3 be not exhaustive.

G.A.I. Not excluded.

[Exit Barnes. Enter Listowel

17

8. Victory Celebrations

C.E. Services objected to Sunday (compulsory parade on a lay-off).

Settled therefore on Sat. Before Whitsunday.

Only objn = day precedg. opening of Labour Party Conf. at Bournemouth. Nos. attendg. that are small propn of 45m.

H.M. My fear was that Ministers cdn’t attend Celebrations: for they have to go early to Confnc. viz Sat. pm.

C.E. Procession will be over before lunch.

H.D. Leak fr. Offl. Cttee. re 8/6: many Members disturbed.

Real business of Confce starts before the opening of the Confce.

This date will wreck the arrangements. for the Confce.

C.E. This date was adopted at 1st Ministerial Cttee – various members of Cab.

Objn considered at 2nd Ministerial Cttee – it was Ministers not offls. wh. decided.

S. Supported C.E.

P.L. India wd. prefer July or August. Little time to bring Indian troops here.

C.E. Aug. wd. be impossible. - holidays. The longer we delay, the less repve of fighting men the Forces will be.

If Cab. v. 8/6, next best wd. be 22/6. If 15/6 no work durg. the week.

E.Sh. Must you have it all?

P.M. Don’t go back on that decision.

P.M. Can’t afford loss of prodn. This points to holiday. Diff. to reject the best day merely because interferes with Labour Party Conference.

R.S.C. Why not another Sunday?

J.W. Feeling in Scotland.

A.B. 8/6 wd. wreck the Conference. Hard choice for public view.

T.W. No fun and games on Sunday night.

H.M. Have them on a Sunday.

G.T. Will be a flop on a Sunday. Nothg. else but the holiday to rejoice over.

You can’t p’pone merely because of Labour Confce

If you p’pone, drop it altogether.

E.Sh. Only real point = Confce.

18

a) Many travel on Sat. or Sund. We are travellg. this year on Sat. We cd. do our business on Sat. pm.

b) Need we be in constituencies? No: either Vict. in Ldn. or Confce.

P.M. Or you cd., as in war, put big business on Tuesday vice Monday.

H.D. I’m thinkg. of rank &amp; file, who are important locally &amp; to Conference.

A.V.A. Balance of advantage clearly in favour of Celebrations on holiday wk. end.

P.M. Take the small business on the Monday.

R.S.C. Choice is: another Sunday or this Saturday.

Agreed: Saturday 8/6

P.M. F.O. Egypt, Iraq and Ethiopia shd. be repd.

C.E. No ques. about Ethiopia = they are Allies for this purpose.

But go outside Athens &amp; you may get claim from Franco.

We will consider that – pity they didn’t raise it earlier.

P.M. Detachments of foreigners w’in B. Forces.

Will Service Dpts. consider. Especially R.A.F.

S. Integration argument.

P.M. That goes against separate detachment.

P.L. Nos. fr. India.

P.M. Adjust with Cttee. 500-1000.

C.E. Proposing somethg. other than traditional W. End route. Armour is going to S.W. suburbs.

K. Include G.P.O. in civil section. At least as good a claim as always.

General support. C.E. will consider.

H.D. Consider inclusion of C. Service.

E.W. Children. In E. End parks as will as R. Parks.

C.E. We have no powers there. Assume l. authies will do the like in their parks. Am sending circular to them

H.M. How select the children for the circus? Prefce for those of ex-Servicemen.

May be wiser not to try.

E.W. 60.000 daily. Schools cd. select.

19

Basic free ration for kids? No!

C.E. Welcome suggn fr. dpts. re further groups to be recognised.

[Exit Tomlinson

9. Commemoration Postage Stamps.

L. 4 months to prepare &amp; issue.

Special issues already bn (issued) announced by Foreign Govts.

Para 2 (a) Many new issues eg. in Australia are on peace &amp; reconstn ques.

(b) No precedent at all in U.K. Suggest we do this for one not both. P.M. F.O. want U.N.O. stamp.

Para. 2(b) – general feeling v. omission of K.’s Head. Use big double size instead.

J.W. Include (para 2) Scott Fine Arts Commn.

E.W. And Arts Council. No!

[Exit Listowel.

10. Clothing Rationing.

R.S.C. These estimates are a bit risky because influenza &amp; coal shortage in Lancs. But must take a risk on it.

Service have concession. 10-15m. coupons all told.

Industrial 10 will be issued in Nov. vice Jan.

P.M. a) Care over Serv. concession – last para. of brief.

R.S.C. Will p’pone until Sept. because much demobn over by then.

J.J.L. Suggest consultn.

P.M. b) Specl. ration for household linen eg. towels.

R.S.C. Considering that now.

E.W. Wd. do more than anything to damp down housewives agitation.

H.M. Postpone announcement. until we are over food.

R.S.C. Must announce the 14: add the rest to make it more cheerful.

P.M. Careful Press preptn. Consult Fr. W.V.S (!)

H.M. Feeling about large nos. of coupons to Services on demobn.

Leave concession ought to be offset. v. demobn grants of coupons.

20

A.V.A. Never thought there was a case for Service concession.

E.Sh. Protested against it.

R.S.C. Agitation in H/C. The 10-15m. coupons we wd. use wdn’t permit 1 coupon increase to genl. consumer.

H.M. How many soldiers need it?

P.M. Wd. rather give 1 more coupon to woman.

S. We shd. value this concession in R.A.F.

J.J.L. I was surprised tht. the concession was offered. Troops have had a v. good deal, it’s the civilians turn.

Agreed: no leave concession.

11. Eire and U.N.O.

a. As in memo.

C.E. Must first consult N. Ireland. Fear Eire, as member, might claim whole of Ireland.

E.Sh. Take care. Is there a strong demand?

P.M. Surely it can be delayed.

No decision: opportunity for H.O. to consider.
