Palestine. H.D. Arabs also have illegal organn. Insert “and Arab”

Agreed.

P.M. Read Trumans’s statement &amp; E.B.’s telegram fr. Paris.

P.M. a) Put U.S. up against it.

we can’t do it alone.

Reinforcemts. Rob 1 Divin + Armd Brig. Group.

But severe measures: bloodshed: + 12 mos. to complete.

A.B. Unless some statement made here at once, alarm &amp; expectns will be excited by Tr. promise of early transfer of the 100,000.

E.Sh. Involves public controversy with Fr. at once, when our policy is to enlist their assistance.

H.M. Statement by P.M. won’t be taken harshly in U.S. Tr. may be in some diffy. but he is used to it.

N.B. Cite actual language of rpt. re 100,000 because Tr. has wrongly said rept. recommends immed. transfer.
