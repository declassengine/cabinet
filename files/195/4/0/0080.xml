[Exit W.W.

2. Palestine.

P.M. Put issue as in telegram &amp; draft reply.

Movement twds. Partition as only practical solution. But fatal to

commit ourselves before Confce.

A.B. Does para. 3 assume no initiative from us?

P.M. No. We realise we may have to impose a solution. But needn’t say so

now.

H.D. Internatl. Cttee of L. Party Exec. last week: strongly urged somethg.

shd. be said to secure satisf. issue at Zionist Congress. If we cd.

indicate we were ready to consider Partition, it wd. help to get

good result at Congress.

R.S.C. This is Silver’s point over again.

C.J. Fatal if Govt. were commd at all at this stage.

Good will increased on J. side by various means. Shd. do no more.

E.Sh. Secrecy cdn’t be m’tained if we indicated our views.

My Dpt. v. anxious re oil posn – affected by any soln of Pal. problem.

Important not to offend Arabs: wd. make our oil posn precarious. Partition as a solution must be allowed to emerge from Conference.

421

3. Shipping: Inter-Governmental Organisation.

B. As in memo.

Diffies in Trade talks with Doms. over use of “discrimination”.

McN. We want latitude on text. Agree in principle.

G.A.I. x/ Cab. views on dupln of internatl agencies.

Overlap with I.L.O. Para. 5., for example.

Want M/L. brght in on any interdepl discn of revised draft.

E.Sh. Endorsed x/.

Substance. Competn of U.S. merchant navy. Much more expensive than B. Under internatl agency U.S. will force us to raise our

wage standards unnecessarily - &amp; reduce our competitive power. Para. 5 on discrimination is bunkum. Can’t avoid it.

Indian views. They will use Lascars at low pay &amp; compete.

Need to ensure B. shipping isn’t hamstrung. No future for it if we tie ourselves up in internatl obligns.

A. Supported.

Take care we’re not hamstrung.

Favours given by N.Z. are discrimination.

R.S.C. Won’t stop discrimination by having no internatl body to discuss it.

Much more hamstrung if we don’t try to get these practices stopped.

This body won’t deal with wages.

A.B. y/ Any attempt made to weight B. wages to take a/c of our social

services?

R.S.C. Also subsidies which are in relief of wages.

P.M. Do I.L.O. consider such points?

G.A.I. Not hitherto.

H.M. Siting of organn. Avoid any commitment to U.S. site.

B. These points shd. have bn. raised when Cab. discussed earlier mema. 422

But misunderstandg. This is devised to avoid complicated machinery under Ec. &amp; Social Council, &amp; to get it preserved to maritime nations.

Prefer agency under influence of important maritime nations.

H.M. Want it considered wtr. this cd. be better done thro’ Ec. &amp; Soc.

P.M. cf. Postal Union: most economical.

U.K. didn’t promote this. But subjects bound to come w’in ambit

of U.N. If so, this is best type of machinery: &amp; will suit U.K.

M/L. points. These are techn. ques’s. for shipping conferences.

E.Sh. .. This is not likely to harm U.K. interests. We stand to

gain fr. abolition of restrictive &amp; discriminatory practices. We

got Indian request rejected – for freedom to make discrimination.

P.M. Departmental objns cd. have bn. cleared on I.O.C.

Council.

R.S.C. Don’t want this done by all nations. Better to get it reserved to

maritime nations.

H.D. Wdn’t U.N. machine be less expensive in staff?

B. No. This wd. only meet when it had to. More flexible.

H.D. Make it condn tht. it has no office or full-time staff.

McN. Convention does contemplate (Art. 12) Secretariat &amp; Site.

1. Approve in principle

2. I.O.C. to consider relations with other agencies, staff etc.
