C.M. 104(46). 10th December, 1946.

1. Egypt.

P.M. Resignn of Sidky.

McN. Saw Amb: Nokrashi wd. sign treaty w’out discussg. interpns.

Said Sidky’s statements must be got rid of somehow.

P.M. Can’t go on w’out satisfn on Sudan Protocol.

2. Persia. Agree nothg. can be done about it now.

E.Sh. Clash in Aberj. Refce (viz. report) to Security Council – Byrnes in

favour: E.B. was against.

We thght. E.B. right.

McN. Believe Persians wd. have reported it anyhow.

Council can’t take any action: issue still on Agenda: cd. be argued

Persia was under oblign to report change in situation.

E.Sh. Trouble with R: or Comm. dominn in Persia.

We are in vulnerable posn in Persia.

Preferred E.B.’s attitude to Byrnes’.

A.V.A. Agree: but in favour of Byrnes attitude, R. Amb. interview with

P. Govt. were v. threatening.

3. Spain.

H.M Thought U.K. were to initiate resoln. See U.S. did so. Why?

McN. Thought on Sat. (conversn with E.B.) we were not going to support

removal of Heads of Mission failing unanimity. See, however,

we have.

P.M. Tactics on spot.

4. Return to U.N. of Numbers of Troops.

A.V.A. M. refusal of verification of home forces. What line will F.O. now

take? Global figures only? not detailed dispositions.

431

McN. Thght. verification confined to armaments.

U.S. declined to support us on census &amp; we were defeated.

We must make a return. Form of it can be considered by experts.

A.V.A. to take expert advice.

[Enter P.M.G.

5. India.

P.L. Reported conversations with Indian leaders.

Re-affirmed our view of Cabinet Mission’s statement.

(they wd. resent): Chairman of Assembly (unreliable):

the Ct. wd. never give another decision on interpretn.

Constituent Assembly is being held. Procedure we intended all along

will be followed.

P.M. Emerged tht. Congress wd. accept ruling by Federal Court. We suggd

any contested point shd. be so decided. Alternatives: H.M.G.

Fed. Court.

Hung in balance because assumed collabn in Govt. wd. induce

sensible attitude.

Don’t know wtr. we succeeded in impressing Indians with gravity.

Statement in Parlt. Opposn leaders ready to discuss in advance.

x/ That might avoid debate – wh. wd. be inexpedient. Suggest therefore

discussion (informal) to-day &amp; Statement on Wednesday.

Nehru claims para. 15 governs other paras. we have interpreted.

We dispute this.

P.L. If Fed. Ct. decided against us, &amp; we did not act on it (Jinnah wdn’t),

V. awkward.

A.B. Do they want to agree?

P.M. Jinnah’s line is going to make Pakistan inevitable. It’s shaping that

way.

A.V.A. Effect of P.M.’s allocution was good. We must now see what happens.

P.M. Warn Cab. tht. Assembly may get bit into teeth &amp; do somethg.

reckless.

Believe they rely on B. Army to prevent things getting too bad. Feel

free therefore to be irresponsible.

We may face a posn in wh. we must say we won’t hold the ring any

longer: give notice of w’drawal on a given date.

H.D. Supported v. bluntly.

A.V.A. But we must then take a/c of – a) adequate provn of minorities in any

constitn on wh. we hand over b) Treaty governing transfer of

Power.

432

Remember – are Parlt. &amp; people ready to agree to surrender

minorities.

Will it be regarded as policy of scuttle.

A.B. We have got it across to India that we are sincere in desire that

Indians shd. govern themselves. The second thing is to get it

equally clear that we are not going to be involved indefinitely

in holding the ring &amp; relieving Indians of ultimate responsibility

for law &amp; order &amp; treatment of minorities.

C.E. Cd. we get out militarily, if we were forced politically to w&apos;draw.

P.M. Plans have bn. prepared.

P.L. Jinnah’s lunch party.

A.V.A. Last week we had social contacts with both sides. The others can’t

E.W. Mil. apprecn of arms at disposal of Congress?

P.M. No major armaments. But many individual arms.

A.V.A. Real ques. then wd. be attitude of Indian Army.

E.Sh. Wd. w’drawal, in disorder, be politically practicable – even if

militarily. We can’t escape our responsibility for m’taining

order.

P.M. Cdn’t do it with B. troops alone – if Indian Army defected – nor the

B. adminve machine either. We cdn’t run 15 yrs’ of firm B. rule

in India.

Needs now a) Keep calm.

b) don’t remove fr. Indians responsibility to face realities.

Agreed as at x/.

P.M. I am invited too.

Recommend we all decline.

return our hospitality. We shd. decline this invitation.

Agreed: decline: P.L. to explain frankly to Jinnah the

reasons.

6. Burma.

P.L. Statement extracted from us in 1931 that their claims to self-Govt. wd.

rank not lower than those of India.

D-Smith sided with old gang in Burma – brght. them all into

Ex. Council: headed by Aung Sang &amp; his anti-Fascist League.

Elections – can’t be held in Burma as quickly as in India [Exit C.E.

because of war devastation. April ’47 = earliest practicable date.

Because of the strike we had to allow Aung Sang prominent part in the

433

Govt. And he wants to expedite v. much our p’mme for p’gress

twds. self-govt.

Invitations to Delegation to come here. Condns now demanded – most

important of these (for them &amp; us) is “independence” w’out

intermediate stage of Dom. status then secession. [Re-enter C.E.

On merits I wd. be against making that declaration in advance. Fear,

course. Pity it wasn’t adopted earlier.

national Govt. We have accepted posn tht. Burma &amp; India shd.

Believe it is realistic to make this declaration.

however, our military position in Burma doesn’t allow us to take

a strong line.

Effective strength of B. troops = 3.000 only.

Can’t face a show-down: B. adminn &amp; Police are v. shaky.

Recommend therefore offering independence w’out first becoming a

Dominion.

Recognise they may ask for even more when they come.

P.M. Differs from India because these are not elected leaders.

But course of events shown that support of Aung San. was right

Wd. go some way to get them over here. Can’t pretend they are

advance pari passu.

H.M. We are getting political reputn for giving away B. Empire.

A.B. But long-term, we may get these countries closer to us after a taste

of independence.

P.M. Finance: they haven’t got it, as India has.

H.D. No further financial concessions, as contemplated in memo.

Overseas expenditure.

P.L. Latitude in spending, not more money.

And no assurance on this in advance.

b) Repercussions on Ceylon &amp; Malaya.

A. No evidence of their competence to govern Burma. Hope we won’t go

as far as this.

Country is in state of roaring disorder. A v. groggy lot. Why not call

their bluff?

P.M. The real incompetence was shown by previous Govt.

C-J. a) Due regard to posn of Shan States in any statement made.

Ceylon say their progress is slower because they have played the game.

Malayan negotns are influenced by events in Indonesia &amp; Burma.

P.M. I accept a). Karens also.

A.V.A. Continuing weakening of communications will eventually threaten our

434

security at home. We are at cross-roads. Discuss with Opposn – who won’t countenance going beyond Dom.

status.

P.M. I will inform – but not consult.

A. Ceylon are readier for self. govt. than Burma.

Shd. be chary of going further than statement re Ceylon.

J. A vague &amp; general statement cast in futuro.

P.L. We can’t take the possible consequences of standing firm.

P.M. Re-affirmn of earlier statements re Burma.

Prepare draft &amp; submit to Cabinet on Thursday.

(P.M. &amp; P.L. to prepare in consultn.)

[Exit P.M.G.

[Enter Bellenger, Hall,

1st Sea Lord &amp; Barnes.

7. Palestine: Arrest on High Seas.

This only gives discretionary power.

A.V.A. Obliged to Admy. for proposed amendment.

taken only at request of High Commr. or C-in-C.

officers esp. as some of the condns cdn’t be ascertained until

Still disturbed at loop-hole “exceptional circs.”

C.N.S. This = attempt to meet needs of C.O. &amp; High Commr.

Read draft signal. “Except. circs. wd. be inability to identify ship

Only analogy I can think of – rum-runners during Prohibn. Our

Right of search = entirely belligerent right.

Diffies at Haifa increased as larger ships used in the traffic.

Amendment: at end of para. 5 insert: “I am however prepd to instruct

C. in C. tht. only in except. circs. may be interfere with ship of

foreign flag unless Admy. notified 48 hours in advance.” To

meet F.O. views.

Not an easy task for R.N. May affect only a few ships.

I was concerned in earlier discussions – insisted then tht. action be

Original para. 5 wd. have laid v. heavy responsibility on junior

he had boarded.

Risk of disaster in boarding. What “exceptional circs.”

Faster &amp; bigger ships: can’t easily intercept w’in territorial waters.

Also desire to divert to Cyprus.

or strong suspicion that she is w’in para. 1.”

J. Not satisfy. this is w’in recognised principles of internatl law.

Admy. resisted search up to 12 mile limit.

435

Right of approach recognised for suspicion of slavery, piracy,

improper use of flag.

Don’t therefore readily assume this extension of the principle wd.

be acquiesced in by other nations.

Oppenheim’s rather obscure statement stands alone.

before she sails.

identificn: week-ends etc.

P.M. Will be taken up by U.S. Govt. and issue of international law will be

A.V.A. Always assumed for 12 mos. tht. enemy ship susceptible to

As a result internatl agreemt. in 1930 re-affirming territorial limit.

P.M. We are standing on letter of internatl law vis-à-vis Albania.

C.N.S. Intern. law protects only ships carrying recognisable national flag = a).

Agreed: defer decision while Admy. &amp; F.O. consult

[Exit C.N.S., Hall &amp; Barnes.

McN. Almost all cases F.O. &amp; Admy. know most about ship [Exit C.E.

Conceded “exceptional circs.” for reasons given by Admy. – lack of

raised.

A.B. Worried about c). If it won’t stop, do you fire on it? Unilateral

resumption of hostilities w’out consultn with Allies.

J. Our pronouncement in the 20’s vis-à-vis U.S.A.

Ship protected only when in control of a master. = b).

Won’t it remove incentive to G. if we allow G. to have all their prodn.

E.Sh. But if they retained their whole prodn they wdn’t have enough.

J.B.H. E.C.O. meeting Thursday.

food rations.

But deficit still of 3.9 on requirements of Zone.

Zones, but not ours, they have agreed to work extra shift to get.

P.M. Shortfall of 2 m. tons from U.S.A.?

J.B.H. Lag only now U.S. strike called off.

A.B. Deficit is only small propn of prodn.

McN. I accept recommns a) and b). 436

But c) shd. be deferred. Report by experts is now completed &amp; awaits

action.

considn by C.F.M. Wd. be precipitate to take this bi-lateral

Pol. consequences – not France alone. Interested in their recovery.

E.Sh. Agree – shd. be content with a) and b).

See what happens as result of that.

A.G. Agreed.

F.W.B. Allocns to B. troops in Austria wdn’t be affected? Or B. Army staff

Latter wd. interfere with Medloc trains.

9. Royalist Yugoslavs in Germany. J.B.H. Found that readiness to accept repatn is increased by moving the men

&amp; separating them from officers. [Exit E.Sh.

Brought to Cab because some risk of resistance – particularly to
