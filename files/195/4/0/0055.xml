C.M. 71(46). 22nd July, 1946.

1. Overseas Economic &amp; Publicity Problems. quantity.

E.F.C. B. element needs watching. No doubt M/F. will watch this.

C. Kerr’s memo: doesn’t cover ques. wtr. work of Civil

Publicity services – Embassy understaffed. Appreciate diffy.

Final small point: care over transport arrangements cd. be improved –

my memo.

Top quality men but fewer of them.

Mistake to concentrate too much on W’ton. Develop Consulates.

c.f. Welshmen in Colorado. Match that with experience of our

H.M. Staffs fallen rather far since war – in appropriateness rather than

Suggest Embassy control. Gather from E.B.’s memo. this

being done.

Publicity – for work of international bodies.

Secretariat is being continued &amp; how – again appropriateness

of the staff.

specialist needed in N. York &amp; perhaps W’ton.

E.B. Began on this as soon as took office.

Need for Embassy to be used. Ministers going over w’out notice etc.

Necessary in war – equally growth of organisations.

Far too many B. officials in W’ton already. Want it slimmed down &amp;

concentrated back into Embassy.

Told Halifax to pull it together &amp; see what cd. be shed. Told C. Kerr

to continue.

F.O. cdn’t know what was happening.

B.I.S. was under M/I. Issued much F.O. knew nothg. about, on matters

of policy.

Brought to a head by handling of W.S.C.’s speech at Fulton. Still

not satisfd tht. it was right to hand it out thro’ official channels.

Want therefore to push on with re-organisation on lines indicated in

P.M. Liquidating a war situation, in wh. we had to match chaos with chaos.

E.B. Have worked out with C. Kerr areas &amp; groups settled in areas.

Consuls, in postings.

A.V.A. Glad E.B. has included his last para. Complaints re situation – rise in

costs.

concerned.

Don’t leave men too long in U.S.

H.D. Ready to be helpful. Prob. don’t need net increase. Some hang-over

R.S.C. Agree – better but fewer. Re-organn going v. well so far as we are

fr. war. 294

Ty. repve in W’ton is considerg. with C. Kerr &amp; will submit recommns

with Embassy must be close, our Mission must be part of

P.M. Wd. like early report from M/F. on policy of food purchase.

consider their relation with Ec. &amp; Soc. Council.

on staffs &amp; allowances.

Agree with spread thro’ Consuls &amp; ?Labour attaches.

Ready to buy the land &amp; concentrate staffs.

Mustn’t have Missions working independently of Embassy.

H.M. Need for element “down town”. Not sure all ought to be concentrated

in Embassy.

J.S. If we go back to trade channels, C. Kerr plan is enough – Food Attache

on F.O. vote &amp; channels. But if M/F. is to be trading organisn

&amp; do the buying, diff. for it to be part of Embassy. Can’t trade

thro’ F.O. machine. Can’t therefore accept para. 5. Tho’ connn

M/Food.

N.B. H.M.’s para. 2. Untidiness inevitable – because started pre Peace

Treaties etc.

The tempy Europ. Cttees have done good work. Must now

Have tried to work for integrn of Health &amp; Educn organns with U.N.

Tendency there however to keep techn. apart fr. pol. considns.

H.M. Too many internatl orgns. Shd. get Cab. authy. before conniving at

establishg. more. Threat to U.K. man-power.

A.B. No harm in functional organisations.

E.Sh. Only create political problems. c.f. E.C.O.

P.M. * Let us have memo. on internatl organisations. *

J.S. Do we reject para. 5?

E.B. Covered by para. 4. of my memo.

2. Palestine.
