C.M. 51(46). 23rd May, 1946.

1. Parliament. crisis = Cl.12: support on Fr. Bench.

A. German war memorials. Can we say something?

E.B. Have sent report to P.M. This was quadripartite decision: can’t

at A.C.C. Berlin &amp; try to get definition reconsidered.

P.M. Think it shd. be reconsidered, in Berlin. The exemption is too narrow.

A. Cd. we say it’s being looked into qua

H.M. Business for next week.

E.B. Friday this week: need to keep a House.

P.M. Nat. Insurance? W.W. Divn. on Friendlies at 6 p.m. to-day. Other

go back on it unilaterally.

J.J.L. This decn wd. permit destructn of their Cenotaph. Cdn’t we take it up

village memorials.

[Enter J.B.H.

J.J.L. Cd. J.B.H. consult Imp. War Graves Commn.

village war memorials.

2. World Food Supplies.

P.M. Cdn’t we say – we do not &amp; shall not interpret it as covering destn of

P.M. (a) Statement shd. be more factual &amp; less argumentative.

H.M. Haven’t in the past.

more genl. formula.

E.B. Stock posn: we’ve refused even loan of 50.000 t. to France. Publish

P.M. But look at the other assumptions lower down.

Cd. we not include figures – stock posn as now &amp; then.

H.M. M/F. have h’to. resisted publication of stock figures.

P.M. You have given them in U.S. – they will come out.

Dangerous to say we’ll carry it on stocks not consumption. Suggd

these figures &amp; its good-bye to Fr. Socialists.

T.W. Dangerous to try to prove too much.

211

A. Yes: but that is reason for not publishing – too many hypotheses.

The figure I wd. like to give is p’mme for G. and India. Diffy. about

H.M. I’m getting those. I will incorporate in main statement.

G.H. Awkward to give figures of these Indian supplies in view of Malayan

Many verbal amendmts. appd.

Public will make all sorts of deductions.

H.M. Wd. prefer to say – contrary to business interests of country to give

stock figures i.e. say that if its raised.

that is that this is still to go to C.F.B.

E.Sh. Why not give figures of what we’ve given previously to other

countries.

position.

Agreed: give no figure of stocks.

Agreed: Make it shorter.

(b) Germany: Immediate Situation. 55.000 t. on 2/6. = 1 wk’s. supply. Then nothing. (That is barley

Can we find means of filling gap from 9/6 to 20/6.

H.M. Ques. really is: can M.F. supply v. firm &amp; early return.

Fr. U.S. supply 440.000 t. by end/July.

Propose 75.000 t. loan with power to M/F. to recover it at will.

J.B.H. These shipmts. can’t arrive before 20/6. By end/next week we shall have no stocks in G. at all.

&amp; potatoes.)

P.M. U.S. Zone?

H.M. Detailed arrangemts. for pooling have to be discussed.

J.B.H. Minimum supply is 100.000. = 3 weeks.

H.M. Gather J.B.H. will guarantee replacement at end/July on terms stated.

A.B. Use this as lever to get pooling going quicker.

J.B.H. We’ve opened conversns with Clay. May have to get him prodded

by W’ton.

B.S. Not prepared to release 1 ton.

They’ve had already 437.000 tons, since I was in office.

E.Sh. Do you accept seriousness of situation in G.? 212

B.S. No.

J.B.H. We have scrambled through, from time to time. [Exit W.W.

E.Sh. We must either help G. or clear out. We can’t afford a break-down

in B. adminn.

H.M. I’m suggesting 75. vice 100. to cover any inflated demands by

C. Commn.

P.M. Let us lend 75.000 &amp; press for early discussion with U.S. on pooling.

A.B. And say nothing about it.

H.M. And M/F. to control recovery. [Exit A.B.

L.P. Off., Cont. Off. &amp; F.O. to consider

at what level

Clay be told to get on with it.

P.M. { Indep. enquiries into stocks etc., on G. farms.

{ E.Sh. to snoop around; and T.W. to send experts too. { After consultn with J.B.H.

B.S. 185.000 t. a month is what Germany needs. U.S. can’t ship enough to

meet all. i.e. Germany, UNRRA., U.K., India etc.

I won’t be a party to loan of 75.000. Offer resignation.

B. Shipping. If addl. supplies promised by U.S. materialise 520.000 to go

to G. &amp; I. in June.

Can move 50.000 fr. Austr. to India.

200.000 can be lifted by B. ships

220.000 will have to be carried in chartered {Authy given for

U.S. ships. If that’s to be done in time must { chartering.

have p’mme definite in 24 hrs.

P.M. What was said in W’ton re shipping.

H.M. We have to be responsible for shipping? M/T. shd. consult with L.P. Off.

P.M. Is it, or isn’t it, poss. to ship it in time?

B. Only doubt is wtr. I can charter U.S. ships to carry the 220.000 t. No

No diffy. in shipping the 75.000 t. after June. Problem = sudden load

B. Yes.

H.M. U.S. &amp; Can. were willing to help.

reason to think I can’t. But must get off the mark soon.

213

on June p’mme.

There will be diffy. in moving the new p’mme: railway strike as well

responsibility, not M/Food alone.

as shipping.

310.000 – up to 830.000 p’mme for June: &amp; at v. short notice. But

not saying it can’t be done.

P.M. (After discussion.) This is a matter on wh. Cab. must take

(c) India.

A.H. Results will be most valuable. India will be v. grateful.

But they will get only 50% of requiremts.

They won’t get it until end/July onwards.

This stresses need for getting all we have p’mmed.

P.M. Note the position. But can do no more.

Madras &amp; Mysore machinery of distn will brk. down early June.

[Exit A.H., Barnes, B.S.

3. Egypt.

A. This is last mtg. of Dom. P.M.’s. Is there any more they can be told

re Egypt.

E.B. There are diffies: but can’t say anything in middle of negotiations.

A. Cd. E.B. at least have a word with Smuts.

E.B. Yes: if he will keep his mouth shut. Will consider it.

4. Publication of Information from Cabinet Documents. Agreed.

P.M. Any objections? None.

5. Publication of Secret Reports of S. Cttee on Nat. Expenditure.

H.M. If we publish Rpt. on Tanks, believe we wdn’t be pressed to publish

the others.

J. Why not Alloys?

H.M. It is libellous: and it wd. provoke demand for proper enquiry.

J.J.L. Tanks – shall have to have it out in the end.

214

H.D. Closely-balanced argument: turned by W.S.C.’s statement.

Agreed: publish Tanks only subj. to consultn (H.M.)

with M/Supply. 215
