C.M. 100(46). 25th November, 1946.

1. Civil Service Staffs. P.M. Announced Cttee.

2. Germany: Fusion of British &amp; U.S. Zones.

H.D. As fr. brief. Trouble is tht. bulk of the £125 m. wd. have to come fr. dollar sources.

It equals $500 millions over 3 years = 5 months’ drawing of U.S. loan.

flow more naturally in that direction.

U.S. offer to swop Zones and go to 65:35. Agree with E.B. this is

politically impossible &amp; dangerous economically. Reject

that, as well as paras. 3-5 of brief.

Conclude: no alternative but to accept 50:50. But conditions.

a) Keep down dollar cost to us to 300 millions. By buying as

much as poss. from soft currency countries. Not much scope

for this in near future: but shd. open up in 2nd &amp; 3rd years of

period – e.g. food from E. Europe in return for G. exports wh.

Stopped at end of para. 9 of brief.

Discussed with Waley, hot from U.S. This is my recommn: as in

para. 10.

P.M. | This won’t affect our policy re Ruhr industries?

|

H.D. x| Presume E.B. has made that clear, in conversns with U.S.

|

J.B.H. | 50:50 basis gives us better moral ground for m’taining that policy.

can’t get it fr. anywhere else.

become a joint responsibility? Fear they may say payment is

P.M. This is right. U.S. have whip-hand because they have the food: we

H.D. Not in 1947.

J. What return on this investment and when? E.g. timber.

H.D. Timber turns on physical resources, not financial.

A. U.S. Loan was for our needs. This is additional. Cd. this be

financed from an additional Loan.

H.D. Non-starter in U.S. politically, since Election.

J.S. Additional condn tht. on fusion procurement of food for 2 Zones shd.

w’in agreemt. but you must procure.

417

H.D. Agree: this shd. be added.

On x/ above, quoted telegram showing E.B. had J.B.H. point in mind.

physical diffy, as we have, in supplying the Zones.

E.M.N.’s brief). Want more than Clay’s word for this.

Congress may say. c) Our expenditure on rehabilitation in G.

J.B.H. For how long: for we want to switch supply of food to easy-currency

countries.

H.D. Relate wording to “such procurement as may be requd fr. U.S.

sources”.

McN. We agree H.D.’s qualifications.

Welcome review after 12 months.

H.M. U.S. “political diffies”. What about ours? And U.S. have no

May be right, however, tht. Congress won’t go beyond 50:50.

Thus, I reluctantly accept.

But condns of our agreement shd. be clear. a) food supply (as in

b) Socialisation policy will go on in B. Zone, whatever

shd. be medium-term reconstn loan to be repaid by G. goods &amp;

services. d) Agreed statement re policy twds Germany.

clear to E.B.

then final decision.

jointly handled: but without prejudice to separate admn of each

Crux in G. = food. We’ve relied h’to on U.S. imports. We might

reduced.

H.D. My estimates are of net

R.S.C. If these condns aren’t accepted, what do we do? That shd. be made

P.M. Agreed. Give E.B. our stipulations: ask E.B. how many he can get:

E.Sh. What is meant by fusion?

McN. External matters – procurement, export-import p’mme – wd. be

Zone.

E.Sh. This wd. give U.S. a say in cost of adminn. If so, how prevent their

interfering with policy.

I regard this as further U.S. blackmail. We shd. look further ahead.

have forced earlier the alternative sources on basis of outlet

for G. exports. But looking fwd., G. food posn will improve.

More rapidly if we cd. import more fertilisers.

To extent tht. G. exports are increased, our expenditure on imports is

costs &amp; assume some increase in G. exports.

All the offsets have bn. taken into a/c.

This also is why we are assuming subsidy will continue only for

3 years.

418

E.Sh. I wd. prefer to pursue isolationist policy &amp; take a chance on it.

E.Sh. Food will be better in 12 months.

H.D. Remember that we are now paying 53:47.

H.D. Fusion is to be a gradual affair – beginning with export-import

No interference, yet anyway, with internal adminn.

R.S.C. Tapering off cost on fusion policy – thro’ rehabilitation of G. industry.

P.M. What will happen in G. while we are taking a chance? Where will

supplies come from.

P.M. What happens m’while?

E.Sh. What assurance of U.S. food under this scheme?

E.W. Does fusion mean joint economic adminn.

p’mmes.

P.M. This plan is alternative to 4 Power working for single economic G.

McN. No thought h’to (in conversns with U.S.) of anything but external

affairs.

J.B.H. Bi-zonal Boards, in Germany, on executive business only [Enter A.B.

of ports, telegraphs etc.

McN. Re interference with Ruhr: this illustrated by Byrnes offering a

higher price on a swop of Zones: was prepared to pay more

to get control of Ruhr.

H.D. Tel. 1886. Para. 2. is the relevant passage.

Makes it clear that U.S. realise tht., if they don’t swop, they can’t

get control over industrial policy in B. Zone.

Agreed: inform E.B. – report back if he can’t get

agreement to all our conditions.

[Exit J.B.H.

3. India. Constituent Assembly.

P.M. Put the short issue.

P.L. The main diffy. between Parties = procedure for constituent assembly.

Explained the views on this of the 2 Parties &amp; attitude of H.M.G.

Moslems: majority vote in each section.

Congress: decide Province by Province.

Tho’ it may seem a technical point, its consequences are v. important.

Viceroy agrees that repves shd. be invited to London. 419

Want time to consider his draft statement.

R.S.C. Agree this is only chance. We must take it, as only means of

unless they agree

Situation v. grave.

retaining initiative.

Time is v. short. Must so arrange tht. they cd. get back by 9/12, here to p’ponement.

P.L. Can Assembly meet on 9/12.

P.M. Say nothing at this stage to suggest p’ponement.

b) agreement reached here will be honoured.

A. Some ground to think a) they’ll come

Agreed: issue invitation.

P.M. Must we ask Sikh. Won’t it lead to others?

R.S.C. Cd. discriminate. Prefer to ask a Sikh.

4. Labour Party Meeting.

P.M. Cab. Ministers to attend Party mtg. on Thursday at 10.a.m.

5. Fuel Supplies for Industry.

E.Sh. Have met N.P.A.C.I. Considered ques. of announcement. Will send

notice to all firms consuming more than 100.000 t.p.a. Also

agreed on gas &amp; electricity method.

Need for haste: may I settle with B/T. vice reporting back to Cabinet.

P.M. We were to consider in light of report.

report to Cab. on Thursday.

R.S.C. Have had no report on this.

P.M. Must be mtg. of Ministers concerned. In default of agreement
