C.M.4(56)							17th January, 1956





		1.	Export of Surplus War Materials.		[Enter R.M., E.H.



W.M.	What emerges is i) mistakes  ii) diffuse machinery  iii) implicns. for f. policy.  Of these (iii) is most important.  What is our object, re supplies – e.g. in M/East.



P.M.	iii) applies more to new materials than surplus.

	Let the W. Paper be presented by For. Secy. &amp; M/Defence.



S.Ll.	And Prs. of B/T.?  



P.M. 	Too many.



E.H.	Speakers in debate on Adjournment.  Nutting to wind up : M/Defence to open.



S.Ll.	Or M/Supply to wind up, if debate is on technical points.



P.M.	Think Nutting will be needed to reply.  Needn’t decide yet.



	Draft of White Paper.



	Amendments discussed &amp; approved.

	Para. 8.  New decision to cut gun-barrels can be added if it can be said that decision was taken well before this row developed.  Probly. not.

	Para. 15.  F.O./B/T. to decide wtr sentence be added making it clear that the licence contemplated re-export fr. France.  Also consequential passage in 20(d).

								[Exit R.M, E.H.



		2.	Malaya.



A.L.B.	Col. Policy Cttee. have considered line to be taken.

i)   Internal security.  We had hoped to retain operational control of police &amp; def. forces.  We think we can retain that – tho’ we may have to concede administrative control over all local defence forces.

	Govr. wd. also have right to disregard advice of Ministers.

ii)  Defence.  Had intended only to suggest tht. agreemt. be negotiated later.  C.P. Cttee. thght we shd. go for formula specifying broadly what rights we shd. need to secure in that agreement.

	The Malayan Delegn. seem to be in reasonable mood.

iii) Constitutional Commn.  Had hoped it wd. be confined to scheme for next stage.  M. Delegn. will ask that. it shd. prepare scheme for full self-govt.  This need not affect timing of change we had in mind (1959) : for task of Commn. wd. be v. long.  Suggest therefore tht. we allow Commn. to consider scheme for both stages.  If we allow this, we believe they will agree that all reserve powers shd. stay in force throughout (i) both stages, until 1959. 

They want Commn. to be composed wholly of people from outside Malaya.  U.K. repve., Austr., Indian &amp; Canadian. 

I will inform Cab. of any unexpected changes or developments.



P.M.	I am concerned about Singapore.  We may have to revert to direct rule there.  It wd. help with that, if Malaya was going fwd. on sound lines.



D.S.	Hope we shall get assurances for our economic interests as quid pro quo for our assistance (on which they must rely) in defence.



A.L.B.	Not proposed to try to write into any Treaty provisions affecting internal taxation etc.,  Can we hope to bind their domestic policy.



D.S.	This is our last chance of getting such an agreement – because of their awareness of need for B. military protection.  We are in strong position to drive a good bargain securing econ. advantages in return for help in defence.  E.g. undertakings v. discriminatory taxation or expropriation of B. interests.



A.L.B.	Will consider what we can get along those lines, consultg. Ty. as

      *	required and B/Trade.





		3.	Tariff Policy.



P.T.	E.P.C. have settled line we shd. take in next round of tariff negotns. at Geneva.

	No dramatic changes are likely.  For U.S. will set pace, &amp; they are limited by their legn. to 15%.

	We are pledged to continue these negotns.



P.M.	We shan’t get anything fr. U.S.  And we shall be pressed to make concessions.  I hope we shall lie quiet &amp; see how existg. agreemts. work out in practice.  I am content, however, that we shd. make the necessary noises.





		4.	Alan Nunn May.



S.Ll.	Important considn. is effect on U.S.



P.M.	Let us at least be able to say we gave him no facilities.



B.H.	L.P. supports v. strongly views of Makins.



Ll.G.	Will be difficulty in continuing his employmt. in U.K.



		Agreed :   Withhold grant of ppt.

			     Continue to try to keep him at work in U.K.



							[Enter B.C. K. E.H.

		5.	Widows Benefits.



B.C.	Report of Advisory Cttee. has bn. received.  Shd. it be published?  All precedents are in favour of publication.  I propose to publish early in Feby.

	May be some trouble over 10/= widow because Cttee. have declined to deal with this case, as they are not w’in their scheme &amp; Cttee. have never dealt with rates of benefit.



H.M.	Cd. not Ministers consider report before publn.



B.C.	There will be Ques : known that report was signed on 10/i : also useful to have public re-actions.



H.M.	Surely we can have quick review of this before publicn.

	Must be able to state a preliminary view.



B.C.	Printing shd. go fwd.  Publn. as late as possible.  Discn. by Dpts. &amp; Ministers to be accelerated.  H.A. Cttee. w’in 10 days.



								[Exit B.C.

[Enter T., Strathc.

6.	Heroin.



	Alternative drafts of statement considered.



		Original draft approved, subject to amendment.



								[Exit T., Strathc.



		7.	Government Expenditure.



P.M.	In B’fd. speech I shall refer to Service pay &amp; its purpose, and also to reduction of adminve. costs – showing what has bn. done &amp; indicating that we shall aim at further reductions.
