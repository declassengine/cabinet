C.M.26(55)								26th July, 1955



									[Enter B.H.



		1.	Parliament.



H.C.	This week re-arranged. Economic debate to-day : F. Affairs y’day.



Sal.	Malta Conference.  How approach D/Norfolk?  I think P.M. shd. do it.



B.H.	H/C. members have bn. approached.  Some wdn’t be available before mid/Sept.



H.C.	Business for week after Recess.



								[Enter H.H.





	2.	Economic Situation.



R.A.B.	Statement quite well received.

	What do I say in speech to-day?

i)	Social Services.  Shall make it plain there will be no slashing cuts in investment – existg p’mmes.

	L.a. expenditure generally – Dpts will look more strictly at proposals.

ii)	Housing.  Read draft. Exp’re bound to be affected.  We stand by authorisns. : starts in ’55 were 80% of ’54 : but further authns. in ’55 only for [urgent slum clearance or overspill.]  No downward move in Scotland, where  starts are already dropping.



D.S.	Cdn’t limit new authns. to [ ] alone.  Wd. create gt. pol. disturbance.  Suggests a v. big change.  Hard enough to get people to accept what we have done already.



R.A.B.	Will adjust what I say : I mean to convey tht. we will go on at about 80% of ’54.



D.S.	That wd. do.  Admit what we have done, but don’t threaten worse.  If we abolish subsidy, Govt. control won’t be needed : l.a. themselves will go slow for financial reasons.

	Cdn’t we avoid giving a figure?  I have averted answering all summer.  Can’t you dodge it for last 3 days?



P.M.	We went above 300,000.  Can’t we say we don’t want to drop below it.  That wd. be a tenable political line.



H.M.	We are shifting more emphasis to un-subsidised.  More of them are being built.



P.M.	Stress the fact tht. we are above 300,000 : and we don’t intend to restrict authns. any further.  M’tain house-bldg at 300,000 or more : and ques wtr they are l.a. or private is irrelevant in a debate on capital expenditure.



D.E.	Wd. make it palatable to say tht. we are re-deploying from houses to schools.  It’s happening.  Take credit for it.  [Received with unspoken scepticism.]



P.T.	Economic need is for redn. in l.a. investment exp’re.  Don’t therefore be too soft, for pol. reasons, on housing.



W.	Remember tht. credit restn. may have effect of slowing down house bldg by private persons.  Bldg. societies are drawing in their horns.



H.M.	But because they can’t get savings.  And credit restrictns. might increase savings.



P.M.	Estimate private bldg : and adjust l.a. p’mmes to ensure total doesn’t fall below 300,000.



R.A.B.	Can say : [adjusting as betwn. private &amp; l.a.] we were above 300,000 mark.  We shall now come down twds it.



D.S.	Avoid even that.



R.A.B.	Will consult D.S. on final text.



	iii)	Exchange Policy.



RAB	Shall declare our aim of keeping sterling at parity of 2.80.  Shall decline to foreshadow future course e.g. on convertibility.



	i)	Social Services : Investment.



J.S.	Chaos if we cut back on hospitals.

	Also, if we delay schools, we shall have conting. transport costs.



R.A.B.	Can preserve status quo on these.  No cuts.

	May have a margin in autumn : cd. prs. let up then.  Don’t want to start a deflationary movement : only disinflationary (!).





	3.	Malta Conference.



H.H.	Mid/Sept. was desired by Malta.



B.H.	16/9 wd. suit W. Elliott.	Agreed : 19/9 (Monday)



P.M.	Conservative Members : Ld. Chanc. in chair.

		P.C.’s: Elliot, Spens.

		Members: Pickthorn, Amery, R. Wood,

		Aitken + Lib. Nat. (Renton or Maclay).

		     Spares: 	M-Radcliffe, Austr. Gray.

	Will announce names on Thursday.



Sal.	Will invite D/Norfolk by special lr. inviting reply to-morrow.   Agreed.

	Second choice: Perth.



P.M.	Go for Perth vice D/N.  Sal. To see him.





	4.	Four-Power Talks.



P.M.	*Records of private talks will be circulated in summer boxes*

	Far East.

	Far the more dangerous.  Private talk with E. : formed impn. U.S. wd. not intervene in Q &amp; M.  E. has “bear by tail” : can’t get Ch. to move out.  R &amp; R. weren’t v. effective emissaries.  Suggd. mght be wise to hold islands only as outposts – to evade loss of prestige if over-run.  In second talk : E. admitted his posn. in U.S. is due to his success in gaining peace in Korea &amp; avoidg war over Dien Bien Phu.  He will continue in such efforts.

	D. on other hand said, if islands were attacked &amp; didn’t at once fall, U.S. wd. have to intervene because D. B. Phu atmosphere.  And interventn. wd. be with atomic weapons.  A most dangerous policy.  D. showed no enthusiasm for ‘outpost’ soln.

	E. will do his utmost.  But he is worried.

	My view is tht. Chiang is black-mailing U.S.

	Europe.

P.M.	V. diff. to assess.  My belief : R. want relaxn. of tension, not merely to gain time.  Strongest motive = fear of G. revival.  That is instinct of R. people.  Even dictatorship must take a/c of that.  B.’s remark tht. “I can’t agree here to E. Germany joining with W. in NATO: my people cdn’t understand that : Stalin wd. never have accepted it”.  B., however seems to realise tht. somethg. will have to be done to re-insure v. risk wh. a united G. wd. represent in 10 yrs’ time.  Significant that they never spoke of threat by U.S.

	Talk on last evening.  Went on to garden.  Rush of photographers.  No security screen at all.  Most unlike Stalin regime.

	K. asked for increased contacts.  E.g. exchange of mily. missions.  We wd. show you what you want to see.  “Send any soldier you like” etc.,  

B.’s suggn. of my visiting Moscow.  I declined.  Then, under his pressure, I said : why don’t you come here”.  He replied : I wd. like to come.  I have invited him : prob. next spring.



Sal.	A v. good thing.



P.M.	Details now arranged.  Will announce in H/C. Wedy.



H.M.	Peace is secure.  R. have decided, clearly, no war while nuclear is available.  Wd. they feel the same if n. weapons prohibited?  Complicates v. much our conduct of discns. on disarmament.

	How do we exercise influence in developmt. of intern-affairs, if war is excluded?

	Far less R. talk of U.S. bases than we had expected.  It is G., not U.S., that they fear.  Plus, prs., where will R. be when China is as strong as G.

	Shan’t get far on G. unificn. in Oct. But steady pressure may lead to agreemt. on basis of Security Pack.

	R. are more relaxed a) because atomic war b) because Stalin is dead.  Fear of wholesale purges has bn lifted.  c) Tho’ Malenkov is out, they wd like to adopt his policy on consumer goods vice investmt. &amp; re-armament.



								[Exit R.A.B.



	5.	Singapore.



H.H.	Tel. 80.  Resoln. passed y’day – i) liberal constructn. of present constitn. ii) where Govr. is requd. to consult, he shd. accept advice.  iii) askg. for new constitn. at once conferring self-govt.

	Govr. has said he must have time to study this.  Marshall, who is behavg. v. irresponsibly, has shown surprise at this.  New constitn. only came into force in Apl.  Must counsel caution : no change w’out discn. &amp; A.L.B. will have 24 hrs. there on Sun. &amp; will be there for some time in 10 days.



P.M.	I wdn’t contemplate altering constitn. now.

	What is M.M. saying to them.



H.H.	If Marshall resigns, we shan’t get another Govt.  We shd. have to suspend constitn.



P.M.	Ask M.M. for early report on his talk with Marshall.



H.H.	I Br. Battn. in Sing + squadron of armd. cars.  Another battn. in Johore.  Police are prob. reliable.





	6.	Security in Colonies.



K.	Obliged to A.L.B. &amp; R.A.B. for co-opn. in getting agreemt. on these points.



H.H.	We were doubtful at first re organn. : but are now persuaded, on basis of F.O. experience.

	Police expenditure.  Diff. to get Colonies in later stages of developmt. to recognise importce. of e.g. police housing.



H.	May C.R.O. be permanent member of J.I.C.?



P.M.	Will consider : Chairman J.I.C. &amp; C.O.S. mght advise (H.M.).



P.M.	K’s Cttee. to remain in being &amp; submit progress reports.





	7.	Japan and G.A.T.T.



P.T.	Austr., [U.K.,] SAfr., CAfr. Fedn. are all inclined to abstain.

	If we were going to abstain, we shd. tell Austr. &amp; others.

	Posn. is as before.  No real change.



H.M.	They have 15 votes.  N.Z. will vote for.  23 votes needed.  W’out Austr. they mght get 26.  We cd. therefore abstain : &amp; she wd. get in, without our vote.

	We cd. vote in favour, up to 11/8, after we know she has the ⅔rds. majority.

	But that is feeble course.  Such protn. as we can get must be thro’ Art XXXV.  Why not get what credit we can from Japan.



P.T.	Accept f. policy arguments.  But we shall have trouble here.

	J. will get in.  If we decide to vote for her, we shd. tell Comm. Govts. concerned.



		Agreed : Vote in favour, about 8/8.  Try m’while to get other

			Comm. countries to take same line.



								[Enter B.C., N.B.



	8.	Hyde Park Traffic Plan. (adjourned).



	8.	Administrative Tribunals.



K.	Radcliffe may have to be re-considered if he decides to resign because of Gulbenkian’s will.

	Ran thro’ other names.  Woman : recommend Miss Younghusband.



J.S.	O. Franks might be suitable alternative Chairman.



K.	Then add Ld. Justice Parker as member.



J.S.	And drop Balfour of Burleigh because of Lloyds Bank.



W.M.	If you ask T.U.C. to nominate, B.E.C. might think they shd. nominate one.



K.	Quite sufft. if M/L. will consult T.U.C. on a name.



D.E.	Add someone who likes to get things done. e.g. Costain.



Sal.	Silkin : D Johnston : L.a. interests : Miss Y. – also answer to that description.



P.T.	A Costain wd. represent industry too.



K.	Don’t need employers as such.



		Agreed : K. to consult with P.T. &amp; W.M. on “repves.” of 

			workers &amp; employers.



								[Enter H. Brooke.



	9.	Hyde Park Traffic Plan.



Sal.	Not worth doing w’out the tunnel.

	Won’t add to beauties of Ldn., but can see no other way out.



N.B.	Don’t under-rate opposn.  50 trees : Hamilton Terrace : will excite public opinion.  Crawford believes tht. scheme was devised w’out due attentn. to amenities.  Suppose you had set problem on basis “what can you do w’out wrecking amenities” it might have led to better solution.



Sal.	Not so sure.



H.B.	If we are to spend £2¼ M., Ty. want to be sure we get best value for money.  If L.C.C. had known fr. outset tht. underground works wd. be allowed, might not a better scheme have bn. devised?



Sal.	H.A. Cttee. worked on basis of old L.C.C. plan : we only considered how to improve it.



B.C.	But our experts advised tht. tunnel wdn’t diminish area of surface works.



Ll.G.	Wd. tunnel alone suffice?



B.C.	No.



D.S.	Can we be sure that this is best method, given a tunnel?



K.	Think of traffic congestion &amp; its increase.  Delay on this is very dangerous.  We must act, despite amenities.



H.A.	Can’t allow standing trees to divert us from that.  They can be planted.



D.E.	Need more informn. about effect of tunnel alone.  Cd. we not start with that &amp; see what relief it affords.



B.C.	The openings, w’out enlarging total area, wd. make posn. worse.



H.B.	8 years’ work has bn. done on this.  But worth another 8 wks. to be sure tht. some of criticisms can be met.  In particular, I wd. like to be sure tht. tunnel is properly integrated in plan.



P.M.	Who is to do this?



		1.	Agree in principle

		2.	See wtr better plan can be devised.  M/T. to convene.



							[Exit B.C., N.B.





	10.	National Service : Science Teachers.



W.	As in memo.  Annoucemt. in written reply to P.Q.
