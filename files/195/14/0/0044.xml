C.M.34(56)							8th May, 1956





		1.	Prince Ernst of Hanover.	[Enter Att.G., E.H., Reading



Ll.G.	In view of importance &amp; nos. affected, I thght decn. shd. be taken by highest court.  

CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000





Att.G.	On one view, effect on marriage of mother of Prince Philip.



W.M.	Is this main reason for pursuing it.



Ll.G.	Not altogether – 400 or so Germans whose naty. may be in doubt.



		Agreed :	Att.G. to discuss with Ld. Chanc., 



CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000



							[Exit Att.G.

[Enter Strathc.

		2.	Nationalised Industries.			



R.A.B.	Recommns. – para. 11.

	a)  Much turns on this.  Must rely on Chairman to avoid projecting past fact into future policy.

	Alternatives:  more debates &amp; P.Q.’s.  Can’t see chance of more than 2 or 3 extra days for debate : and P.Q.’s now don’t get beyond No. 50.

		Standing Cttee.  Cdn’t rely on majority on any issue.

		Difficult to whip.

	Hence my concln. in favour of Sel. Cttee. with safeguards in para. 11.  Gaitskell supports recommn. in (c).

	Constitutional innovation : wd. give new powers to Parlt. to send for “persons” of this type.

	Tactics : much talk on Coal Bill on this ques : wd. prefer to listen to that &amp; make announcement early next week.



E.H.	This course is least of evils.  Tho’ any will have embarrassments.  Disposed to announce before debate.  No constructive solution likely to be put fwd. then &amp; some criticism for our delay.



K.	Party has always argued for more control over natd. industries.  Support this solution.



R.A.B.	M/F&amp;P. and M/T.  wd. accept this solution.



S.	J.S. is worried.  Precedent of Cttee. on Nat. Expenditure in war.  Why not more debates?  If there are critical reports, they will have to be debated.  Another 3 days fr. Supply?



R.A.B.	Debates, such as there are, will be more effective after examn. of “reports &amp; accounts”.



S.	Can you control the Cttee.?



Ll.G.	Effect on recruitment of Chairmen &amp; members of Boards?



H.M.	P. Secretaries have to undergo stiff enquiries by P.A.C.  How cd. we justify saying it’s quite inappropriate for natd. Bds.

	Over the years Left will be defending Bds. &amp; Right criticising them.  Will that do us any harm?

	Ventilation of e.g. labour relations in these industries mght do some good.  All we know now is what they cost.



D.S.	To make analogy with P.A.C., call it “Natd. Industries Accounts Cttee.” General approval for this.



D.E.	Don’t damage career prospects in natd. industries.  Hope Cttee. will see they have a duty in this respect.  Or you won’t get the right men.  Of two methods of doing this, I wd. prefer to tell truth about the industries rather than cover it all up.



		Proposals approved.



P.M.	Timing : announcement before or after debate.



P.T.	Don’t appear to do it under pressure in debate.



R.A.B.	P.M. to announce in reply to P.Q. before the debate.		Agreed.



H.M.	Ty. officer will be made available, as recommended.	Agreed.



P.M.	R.A.B. to provide notes for supplementaries.



	

3.	Automation.



I.M.	Word has caught on &amp; is being used loosely.  But there is a sub-stratum of real fear among workers.  I.L.O. Director regards it as major social problem.

	Communists are fishing in this troubled water.

	Answer to 3 P.Q.’s to-day.

	P.M. Ques Thurs.  There will be pressure to know if a particular Minister will take a co-ordinating role.  Boyle mght be Chairman of a Cttee.

	Can we go further than x/?  Cd. we offer to “help” as well as “study”.  There are things Govt. cd. do – e.g. special training.



P.T.	Mght be read as implying more e.g. further Govt. responsibility for distn. of industry, diversification.



P.M.	Shd. we plunge in, in all directions, before we have decided more precisely how far we accept responsibility &amp; what Govt. action can do.  Shd. we not first go into problem more fully ourselves?



R.A.B.	This draft answer won’t get much praise.  There is a Bill proposg. establishment of statutory Cttee.  Shall be asked why we don’t do that.

	Cd. we not study D.S.I.R. report – say we are doing so.



P.M.	Favour publishing this.



H.M.	In Standard dispute this has bn. muddled up with re-tooling.

	First, admit the problem.  Second, action : is not this primarily for industry concerned.  Third, if they can’t cure it all themselves, Govt. can come in to help – e.g. other industry, training etc.,

	Outline this now, in reply to P.Q.’s : but work it out more fully later.



		Draft answer by I.M. approved subject to amendment.



R.A.B.	By Thursday’s P.Q. (P.M.) H/C. will expect somethg. about emergence of appropte. machinery to grip &amp; guide this development.



P.M.	That aspect can be considered by Cab. on Thursday.





4.	Malta.



A.L.B.	For informn.						Noted.





		5.	Cyprus.



A.L.B.	Govr. has decided not to commute either death sentence.  The men will be hanged on Thursday. 

	There is a residual prerogative with Sovereign.  But this hasn’t been exercised for years past.
