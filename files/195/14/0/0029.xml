C.M.19(56)							6th March, 1956



	1.	Jordan.					[Enter E.H., R., A.N.



		Preliminary discn. of handling of debate in H/C. on 7/3.



P.M.	M/E. policy must be founded on protn. of our oil interests.



R.A.B.	Closer rapproche with Israel?  Wd. be favoured by some of our supporters.



P.M.	Useless : they have no oil.



S.	Real problem is Nasser – new Mussolini.



P.M.	Ultimate answer to him : get U.S. to adhere to Bagdad Pact.



RAB.	Debate to be described as “genl. sitn. in M/E” rather than Anglo-Jordan relns., on wh. we shall not be ready to say more by 7/3.



H.M.	Iraq is being led to take strong anti-Israel line because of reluctance to draw away fr. other Arab States.  If they were strengthened – either by U.S. adherence or by Nasser’s diminishing force – they wd. be readier to favour accommn. with Israel.  They can live with Jews.



S.	Wd. it be easier to get U.S. behind a vigorous anti-Nasser policy vice pro Bagdad policy.  E. can’t be won over.



P.M.	So far, their resistce. to Bagdad has bn. due to reluctance to alienate Nasser – for they hope for settlement of E/I. dispute.



P.M.	Next step qua Jordan is to urge Iraq to use influence &amp; prepare to take our place in Legion.

	Draft telegram to Bagdad – approved.





		2.	Cyprus.



		Deportation of Makarios and Kyrenia.



ALB.	Final view of Govr. (on deportn. of Makarios) is in Tel. 507.  I don’t favour course (b) in that telegram.  Choice is therefore between Seychelles and U.K.

	My preference is for Seychelles.



H.	If he has done all that is stated in Tel. 489, shd. he not be charged?



A.L.B.	That wd. lead to a death sentence.  V. awkward.



		Agreed :	deport to Seychelles : as soon as possible

recognise that this will lose moderate Labour support in U.K.

				Advance informn.(l hour) to U.S. Consul in 				Cyprus, and advance informn. (1 hour) to State			 Dpt. and Dulles in Karachi.



	Jamming Athens Radio.



ALB.	Effectively operable on medium-wave fr. Athens.  But now appears tht. it won’t work v. well v. short-wave.

	Hear D.W.S. cd. do it from U.K.  But it wd. be known to come fr. here.  After 2 wks delay we cd. do it from Malta.



P.M.	Don’t use U.K.  Go on with Malta : provided it won’t interfere with anything outside Cyprus.





		3.	Security : Conference of Privy Councillors.



P.M.	Publication to-morrow.

	V. short statement by P.M. announcg. availability of W. Paper.



R.A.B.	W. Paper is a gloss on Report.  Will need much elaboration in debate.

	cf. para. 15.  relatives : will upset people.

	cf. para. 16. second sentence = Star Chamber.

	cf. para. 19. invites recrudescence of B. &amp; M. debate.



I.M.	Para. 13. – ? add to senior posts or to higher posts.  No appln. e.g. to G.P.O.



H.M.	Redraft sentence in para. 16 in terms omitting reliability of individuals.



S.	Wd. it not be wise to get Labour members of Conference to approve W. Paper – as a short version of Report.



		Agreed :  Ll.G. to show draft to Morrison &amp; Strauss.



P.T.	Para. 6.  Shd. we not define “scant informn.” for our own guidance.

	What is it which debars Civil Servant fr. highest ranks.



		Agreed : to be presented by P.M.





		4.	Balance of Payments Prospects.



		Note taken.





		5.	Industrial Relations.



P.M.		Mtg. with T.U.C.				[Enter H.A.





		6.	N.Ireland Parliament : Disqualification.



		Approved.					[Exit E.H.

								[Enter A.J., H.W., Str.





		7.	Coal : Distribution Costs.



		Approved.





		8.	British Transport Commission.



		Not heard.

								[Exit A.L.B., AJ.  H.W.

[Re-enter E.H.

		9.	Farm Price Review.				



H.A.	Thank H.M. for sympathy.

	N.F.U.’s won’t come below £33 M.  They won’t accept abolition of individual guarantee.  We believe this is moment to end it – for money &amp; staff economy (300).  This will give first ground for reservation by N.F.U.’s.

	On price guarantees, Ministers agreed save on milk (½d. or ¼d.)  We are producg. right amount, but slight upward tendency.  ½d. wd. recoup increased cost, v. nearly.  ¼d. wd. discourage prodn.  But this is item on wh. farmers will fight – for ¾d. at least.  It is the prop of small farmer.

	No chance of agreed settlement.  £23 M. is highest to which we shd. go.  But wd. be on stronger ground to fight farmers if we gave ½d. on milk.

	This settlement will bear v. hardly on N. Ireland because they are small &amp; ill-equipped farmers.  

	Long-term.  Must find means of getting away fr. annual reviews and giving longer-run guarantees. cf. letter in Times to-day.  Shd. like to include a sentence to this effect in W. Paper.



H.M.	Agree with this aim : but don’t want to promise consultn. before we have an alternative.  Wd. prefer to get on with search for alternative.

	Schedule is agreed.

	Had hoped meat guarantee wdn’t be invoked.  But will be now, as food prices generally are falling.

	Issue outstanding is ½d. or ¼d. on milk.  Will the addl. ¼d. make all the pol. difference in constituencies?  I leave this to Cab. decision.  Somethg. to be said for a row this time.



Str.	¼d. wd. meet need in Scotland.



H.A.	Trouble is nil on eggs : nil on pigs : only ¼d. on milk.  That is why I believe another ¼d. wd. help politically.



Ll.G.	Never has bn. economic case for addl. ¼d. or so on milk.  If it’s given, it yields too much for larger farmers.  N.I. wd. sooner have more on pigs &amp; only ¼d. on milk.



H.A.	Wasn’t sure wh. I wd. prefer : but in E &amp; W. the extra ¼d. on milk wd. go best.  We ought to m’tain pressure on pigs in order to increase efficiency in their prodn.



H.M.	Support view of H.M. v. more on pigs.



D.E.	To discourage wage increase next year, better to have lowest possible award on prices.



H.A.	But nos. in industry are dropping too fast.



R.A.B.	First imposed settlement.  Don’t want to alienate farmers, as well as teachers.  No solution in sight of long-term guarantee.

	I wd. increase milk by ½d. &amp; give total of £24 M.  That won’t be regarded as a soft settlement.



H.	Surprised you haven’t made a bigger cut in wheat.



		Agreed :	½d. on milk (£24 M) – as best means of

				combating disappointment of small farmers.
