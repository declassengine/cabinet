C.M.10(56)							9th February, 1956





		1.	Washington Talks.				[Enter E.H.



L.P.S.	Welcomed P.M. on conclusion of successful mission.



P.M.	President E. looked fit &amp; well.  Relieved of much detail, he was readier to handle major business.  More time to reflect and to be helpful.  Not clear wtr he is well enough to undertake full days’ work on Presidential duties.

	O.E.E.C.  Some diffy. over Messina.  U.S. have same sort of feeling for this as they had for E.D.C.  They are less alive than Canada to danger of high-tariff group.

	Germany.  They support our view tht. G. contn. to our costs must continue.

	M/East.  Most important factor – U.S. felt we shd. make it clear we wd. carry out tripartite declaration.  But words limited by President’s need for approval of Congress before U.S. forces are engaged: sounds less forceful than it is.  U.S. are moving naval vessels to E. Medn., unobtrusively.  H.M. ships are conforming to this movement.

	Israel.  Agreement to increase Burn’s observers.

	Baghdad Pact.  Strong moral support.  Discussed what aid be given to each member.  Persia to export more oil : U.S. support for decln. on line in Pak/Afghanistan : some more Centurions for Iraq : more financial aid for Turkey.

	Saudi Arabia.  They accepted our thesis tht. Saudi wealth is menace.  But we cdn’t see what to do.  Sell them obsolete arms : divert them to cap. investment in social development – roads, hospitals etc., On our dispute – we rejected renewal of arbitn. : U.S. agreed tht. direct talks wd. be best &amp; will support our efforts to prevent recourse to Security Council.

	F/East.  Long discn. on off-shore islands.  Chiang has increased his forces there, contrary to U.S. wishes.  Patrolling with air force over m’land.  No US. troops there.  No Communist build-up.

	Strategic Controls.  Prs. E. over-rode advisers in counselling relaxation.  Our case was based on needs of Colonies.

	Atomic Energy.  Exchange of informn. re R. tests.  Deductions have h’to bn. withheld.  He has promised to try to do more on this.

	Weapons : v. generously treated. Shall save millions &amp; much research.



S.Ll.	Americans will support Messina and Euratom.  Doubtful if this is in our interest ; for we can’t join in.

	M/E.  Dulles was tough, considering Jewish vote.  Won’t give Israel more arms at present – or only bare minimum.

	On 9 or 10 Feb. Co-ordinatg. Cttee will meet &amp; report to Ambassadors on Tuesday.  U.S. disposn. is to give nothing.  Fr. may press the Mysteres.  This on supply of fighters to Israel to counter threat of R. bombers supplied to E.  Perhaps some U.S. interceptors.



D.S.	Wd. need big backing of radar and ground organisation.



J.S.	Canned meat?  



P.M. 	No progress.  Cd. pursue it thro’ diplomatic channel.  



W.M. 	Wd. be useful, in reln. to reduction of other food stocks.  



P.M.  	Put proposals to S.Ll. – after H.M. has discussed storage implications.



R.A.B.	Atomic tests.  I was convinced.  Regn. wd. imply tht. tests are dangerous, which they deny.  Esp. now that. ground bursts are not to be repeated.  Genetic effects scouted.  No anxiety in U.S.A.

	As disarmament measure, wd. not help w’out full control of H. bomb.



S.Ll.	They have handled publicity on this better than we.  Have promised to send their data.  Medical report in March : but fully co-ordinated medical/scientific enquiry now in progress will not be completed for 2 years.

	We mght consider wtr there is evidence wh. we cd. publish – in White Paper.



I.M.	Rpt. of M. Research Council may be available in March.  Likely to be helpful.



P.M.	Ottawa. Successful talks.  They are v. content with our relations with U.S.

	Wheat Agreement.  If we can’t join it, they hope we will say so early.



S.Ll.	Wiser for us to indicate nature of Agreement we could join.

	Soviet Economic Drive.  U.S. are organising better intelligence on this.  We will join in this.

								[Enter R.M.

	

2.	Defence White Paper.



W.M.	Printing difficulties.

	No change in strategic picture.  This describes appln. to each Service.  In global war Services wd. have to do their best with what they had.  Survival therefore, rather than offensive, wd. be main feature.

	Para. 6. last sentence.  Necessary as lead-in for discn. of graduated deterrence.

	Para. 8(i).  As in ms.



D.S.	Danger of using diff. words each year to say same thing.  Watch this in future.  Wiser not to re-state role in different words.



S.Ll.	Last sentence of para. 3.  No ques of “ignorance”.  Delete “1b… ignorance” &amp; substitute “people” for “Govt.” at end.



P.M.	Para. 45.  We shd. re-consider supply of Hunters to 2nd. T.A.F. if they are inadequate substitutes for Sabres.



D.S.	Para. 70.  Have Australians agreed to publn.



A.L.B.	Para. on Malaya.  Omit because subject to ratification by Rulers.



	Civil Defence : Evacuation.



Ll.G.	Difference of opinion re para. in [  ].

	Fear this wd. encourage sauve qui peut.



J.S.	Over 11m. in priority classes – 3 times as many as in last war.



W.M.	But see para. 123 : no shelter in target areas.



D.S.	Unwise to imply that there will be no further evacuation beyond priority classes.



P.M.	Para. 16(iv).  Later passage must be up to that level.



Ll.G.	We can’t do more than the priority classes.



		Agreed  :	Amend as shown in C.P.(55)30.



	Publication.	16th. February.

			20th. February – Service Pay.



H.M.	Distribn. in Annex III to be re-arranged w’in same total.
