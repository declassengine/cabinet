C.M.22(55)								12th July, 1955



									[Enter B.H.

		1.	Atomic Energy : Statement by Scientists.



P.M.	B. Russell has written askg. me to give public expn. of my views.

	U.S., who were concerned in advance, were relieved at statement wh. emerged.

	Read draft reply.  Welcome recognn. tht. it is war, not at. weapons, that shd. be outlawed : this is in line with Govt. policy.



Sal.	Annual confce. of Parliamentarians in Aug.  Invited Minister to give welcoming address on this ques.  Have told W. Elliot this wd. be mistake : but promised to send message.





	2.	European Fund : Diplomatic Immunity.



H.M.	As in memo.



R.A.B.	Doubt if there will be any “branch” in U.K.



H.C.	Then do we need to have Order – if it’s academic.



H.M.	Make provn. in agreement.  Consider later wtr Order is needed.  Approve 4(b) – but only when we know its required.



								[Enter B.C., G.Ll.

		3.	Economic Situation.



R.A.B.	E.P.C. minutes.  Reserves : as in Appendix.

	Fundamental sitn. : no grave deterioration.  Due to increased imports caused by prosperity + coal imports.  Classical diffy. for Br.  economy : effect of inflationary condn. on b/p.  Aggravated by strikes as shown by June trade figures.  Diffy. in controllg. our costs because wage increases.

	This sitn. cd. be held for 12 mos. – if it didn’t cause confidence failure.

	But latter mght cause a run.  And, on merits, want /surplus/ more reserves for overseas investment.

	Rumours (Fin. Times) re our intentns. on currency.  Arise fr. Paris discns. on multi-lateral clearing system.  Too much talk in banking circles.

		Must therefore “handle” situation.  Methods –

i)	Credit restriction.  We are tightening this up – thro’ Banks.

	Diffy = operating it v. gt. flood of expansion.  Prodn. rising &amp; emplt. is brimful.  But Banks think it will produce effect.  They want Govt. support, in public, for this policy – in statement before Parlt rises.

ii)	banks are indignant tht. same policy has not be applied to public sector.  Want annoucemt. tht. investment p’mmes in this sector are being slowed down.  Think we can do this, after consultn. with Dpts. Natd. industries.

iii)	Govt. &amp; l.a. expenditure.  Wish here also to indicate slowing down.  Wd. affect e.g. roads p’mme.

iv)	H.P. on motor cars.  25% deposit + 2 years.  But increased sales, none the less.  Wd. sooner tighten h.p. than increase p. tax.  64% increase June 54/55 in h.p. sales.  Motor cycles &amp; cycles similarly.  Wd. wish discuss this with B/T.

v)	If foregoing isn’t enough, we may have to consider other measures.  

Must we launch direct attack on consumer expenditure?  

	Simplest, shock treatment, wd. be to rumour bread subsidy. We shd. consider it.  Wd. like to discuss with M/Ag.  Possibly reduce this &amp; increase subsidy on milk.

	Wd. like Cab. views on (v).  It might be reserved for autumn budget or even next spring.  Ques : when shd. we do it?



P.M.	Must think v. hard about this.

	Politically, this is time to do anything disagreeable that is necessary.  If (iv) &amp; (v) measure must be introduced, this is time for them.  Wd. like to consider bread further because of effect on wages.

	Presentn. : how convince public tht. this is necessary when all is booming?  Cd. relate it to exports (+ strike effects).  That wd be the way to get it understood.  Also give industry to know tht. more of this can be avoided if they increase exports.

	Stock exchange boom.  Can we express our dislike?  Is carry-over system capable of adjustment?  Can we do anything?

	Nat. Service.  We will review after Geneva.  That wd. help.



W.	Apprehensive about reducg. bread subsidy.  Wd. support wages claims, &amp; that is main danger.

	Prosperity is brittle.  Doubt if Bank rate is curbing much.  Credit restn. will be increasingly felt.  But need for Govt. lead.  Govt. shd. practise what it preaches.  We aren’t reducg. Govt. exp’re.  I wd. favour delaying road &amp; rail improvemts. pro. tem.  2% unemployment. wd. give us more prodn.  Need for restn. in cap. exp’re. for wh. Govt. is responsible.



R.A.B.	Diff. for Banks to apply credit restn. discriminatingly – to avoid cuts on export or investment activity.

	Bank advances to natd. indies. will have effect tht. total credits will be reduced by less than Banks were asked to secure.



B.C.	Road &amp; rail p’mmes are in such early stage tht. delay wd. save us money or resources – but wd. put us back for years, in the future.



Sal.	Dislike direction in wh. we are moving.  Need is to restrict consumer demand.  Because that is politically diff, we are tending to make investment cuts wh. we don’t believe in – e.g. road p’mme  Shd. we not put consumer demand first, not second?

	Bread subsidy : housing subsidy : these (more unpopular) wd. be more rational.

	We aim at the false economy because we fear to tackle the true one.



H.A.	What we need is more investment &amp; less consumer exp’re.  Nonsense to subsidise bread when people buy t.v. sets etc., £40 M. p.a. 1.3 on c/l.  5d. p.wk. per head of popn.

	Wd. wish therefore to abolish it.

	Means :	i)	in Budget, with compensns.

			ii)	together with other unpopular measures.

	Wd. not wish to do it alone.

	Milk : consumptn. shd be increased; but doubt if a lower price wd. secure that.



H.M.	Monetary aspect.  Action in reln. to natd. indies. is necessary in order to get Banks to apply credit restn.  Pity natd. indies. weren’t forced on to market when rates were lower.

	Stock Exchange boom.  Due largely to unrealistically low dividends over 15 years.  Must increase value of equities.  Public are realising tht., in full emplt. it’s better to own equities than trustee stock or cash.  Stiffer monetary policy wd. help to put that right.  

Reality.  Due to excessive consumptn. of imports. – or goods needing imported materials.  Need to encourage frivolous exp’re. – e.g. prostitution (transfer payments).



O.P.	Hope RAB won’t exclude savings.  People are spending too much.  Make small savings more attractive.  Good Conserv. policy.



J.S.	Support h.p. vice p. tax: on (iv).

	Support H.A. on bread &amp; milk.

	Timing : not v. long since Election.  Drastic action wd. look more consistent in Oct., than now, with our Election boasts on prosperity.



W.M.	Autumn conferences are starting-point for wage claims.  What we want is more work for same wages – not reverse.

	Hard for employers to resist claims, if c/living has bn. jerked up by abolition of bread subsidy.  Also if business prosperity is so patent.  The “cake” seems to be there.

	Wage- earners wd. recover fr. increased c/living.  But what of fixed-income groups.

	Industrial relns. need to be improved, not worsened.  Effect of dock-strike were felt tho’ 2/3/rds. were working.

	Nat. Service.  A reduced call on manpower wd. help the economy v. materially.  Further in roads by exemptn. wd. undermine system.



D.E.	Measures taken shdn’t provoke wage claims.

	Two poss courses	i)  make it clear tht. we aren’t touching the investment needed to ensure increased productivity.  Cuts shd therefore be concentrated on non-productive exp’re.

		ii)	Stock Exchange boom.  Must be tackled.  Cd. you get small investor into equities via insurance companies.  You won’t get him to do much more on trustee.



H.A.	Anyhow, it’s wrong.  Because saving money lets him down in times when value/money is bound to drop progressively.



Ll.G.	Consider bread subsidy.  Exp’re. on sweets &amp; ices is larger than on bread &amp; milk.  How justify bread subsidy in those circs.



H.A.	Exp’re on sweets : £200 M. p.a.  What about taxing it?



D.S.	Housing subsidy – memo. on Thurs.

	Concentrate action on real problem.  Electricity investment is last thing to be cut.



R.A.B.	Discuss with Ministers responsible for natd. indies. what we can do &amp; say to support Banks in credit restn. policy.

	Discuss with B/T. plans for h.p.

	Govt. expenditure : Ty. as before.

	Bread subsidy : discuss with M/Ag.  Doubtful about doing it before autumn conference.

	Stock Exchange : report to B.H.

							[Enter Att.G.

							[Exit B.C.

	4.	Clean Air.



D.S.	Exempting all existing houses wd. depart fr. Cttee’s. plan &amp; give industry an opportunity to run out.

	Not sure tht. higher grant wd. mean early increase in cost to Exchequer.  

	Choice : alternative (b) or leave Bill as it stands.



R.A.B.	Cd. we suggest one third each – for Govt., l.a. and owner.



D.S.	I wd. accept that.



Sal.	Memo. over-simplifies issue.  Cost has proved quarter than at first assumed.  Cttee. said £10.  Further research suggests average of £20 &amp; much higher on older houses, wh. are already the most uneconomic for owners.

	R.A.B.’s compromise is most valuable.



D.S.	Don’t want Exch. contn. to be reduced from 37½% to 33⅓%.



J.S.	Beaver Cttee. recommended 50% fr. Exchequer.



D.S.	Nothg. to prevent l.a. fr. working out higher rate for small old property.



O.P.	Must ensure tht. l.a. pays not less than owner.



		Agreed : RAB to consider rev basis of 40 : 30 : 30.



								[Exit G.Ll.

5.	Cyprus.



A.L.B.	Have evolved, with Govr., form of law – furtherance of organn. wh. has been responsible for violence etc.,

	Satisfd. these powers are necessary for m’tenance of law &amp; order.  Courts won’t give further remands in custody.

	This is moment to break up EOKA movement – by arrest of only 20 or 30 more.

	Risk of T/Greek communal strife in Cyprus.

	Peake (Athens) does not dissent.  Aimed at terrorism.

	Firm adminn. in Cyprus is necessary to complement conciliatory move in reln. to conference with G &amp; T.



K.	Govr/Cyprus put security &amp; intelligence v. low in his order of priorities.

	He may be suffering now from this error of judgement.



		Agreed : Govr/Cyprus to be authorised to make this law.

		Inform Peake &amp; Bowker so that he may deal with GK. Govt. telling them, after event, if he judges necessary.





	6.	Monopolies.



P.T.	Reason to believe tht. Party can be carried along on this policy.  I will open debate on these lines.  Att.G. will reply.



R.A.B.	V. ingenious.

	After debate, we shall have to think.



								[Exit Att.G.

	7.	Legislation Programme.



H.C.	Of List A, only 6 out of 12 are likely to be ready.



H.A.	Gowers (Agric.) might be introduced in dummy.



H.C.	Family Allowances might get in before recess.



D.S.	Mght get Clean Air.  Shall get Rural Sewerage.



P.M.	Go hard for Gowers &amp; Clean Air.



R.A.B.	Pensions Increase Bill may be needed in autumn.



P.M.	Junior Ministers?



RAB.	Cttee. hasn’t yet met.  Will get ahead.



P.M.	Seen C.R.A.  F’coming about H/Lds. expenses.  Favoured increases for junior Ministers.  But sees diffie. in reln. to senior Ministers.  I suggd. they prs. they mght get some part of Parly. salary e.g. £500.  But clear he wants M.P.’s allowance increased.  I gave no encouragemt. on this save possibility of paying for Friday.
