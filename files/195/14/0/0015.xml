C.M.5(56)							23rd January, 1956





		1.	Pensions Increase.				[Enter B.C., E.H.



K.	Cab. authd. prepn. of Bill in July : announced 17/xi : we are committed to it.  Much pressure for it.  Proposals : eliminate means test : differn. v. those w’out dependants : increased rates.  Cost £10-11 M.

	1922 Cttee. have more costly plan : £20-25 M.

	Paras 7 &amp; 8 : arguments in favour of Govt. plan.

	Outstanding ques : (i) Effect on social services payments : fam. allowce. widows, old re-compn. cases, earnings test, Br. Legion. B-C. wants assurance tht. these will be considered on their merits &amp; for Parly. time-table also on merits. 

	ii)  1922 Cttee. plan.  Para. 12.  Popularity of Govt. plan wd. be prejudiced if 1922 Cttee. plan leaked out.  Executive of 1922 Cttee. haven’t yet approved it : but will leak if report goes to full Cttee.

	Propose therefore tht. our plan be announced on 26/i &amp; that Minister shd. then explain it to 1922 Cttee. &amp; say why their plan can’t be adopted.  We shall be criticised for not havg. consulted Party groups &amp; for not havg. considered their plan.



R.A.B.	Risky to treat 1922 Cttee. thus.  They haven’t even seen their Sub-Cttee.’s rept.

	Suggest Ch. Whip &amp; I see J. Morrison &amp; make a plan with him.  E.g. Govt. shd. tell Executive of 1922 tht. it must produce its plan – as it has to be discussed with l.a.’s etc.,  Get their authority for us to see their report.  Meet 1922 Cttee. at once : explain sitn. to them : make no announcemt. until next week.  Risks disclosures over week-end : but better to take that risk.



P.M.	Ministers’ statements to 1922 Cttee. will leak.



J.S.	Executive is less likely to leak.



B.C.	This Bill doesn’t confine relief to hard cases.  Substantial addns. for people with high pensions.  Repercussions on those receivg. much smaller social service payments will be severe.

	Must therefore be free to deal with latter on their merits.

	If so, I think we can prob. handle it.



P.M.	At what cost?



B.C.	See Annex IV.  Disabled ex-Servicemen also : &amp; I can’t quantify that.



H.M.	These middle-class people have bn. suffering for years.  In these difficult econ. circs. we spend another £10 M. on them.  This must sharpen demand for action on cases in Annex IV.  We can’t hope to resist a) – d).  Repercussion on war pensions mght cost £7 M. + (for insurance) £80 M.

	I see no way out of this.  But will lead us into v. expensive courses.

	Suggest we must reserve posn. on this until after review of ec. sitn.

	Are the economic circs. such that we can lift the means test?



R.A.B.	If we delay, we shan’t settle it for £10 M.



H.A.	Doubt if this is moment to abandon means test.  Can’t we do the rest?



K.	Wd. detract seriously from popularity of our plan, but wd. help M/P. to hold his position.



D.S.	H.M.’s memo. will involve abandonment of other commitments.  May be reason for not going fwd.



P.M.	We are v. deeply &amp; recently (B’fd) committed to doing this. “shortly”. e.g. Fin. Secy. on 17/xi.



H.M.	Mght face it if we cd. settle quickly for £10 M.



P.T.	Can you avoid doing this, while wage claims are being conceded.



H.M.	If we do this, M/P. must avoid any promise that other cases will be considered on merits.  We must hold ourselves quite free to resist them.



D.E.	On policy of “pulling out concertina” we shd. not skimp these.



R.A.B.	V. little room in Leg. P’mme for any Annex IV proposals.



H.M.	If we give the £10 M. we shall prob. have to concede £5-6 M. on Annex IV ;  but we can play that slowly.



H.M.	1)  Approve this.



		Agreed.	2)  No commitment on Annex IV

				3)  Leave L.P.S. to negotiate with 1922 Cttee.





2.	Broadcasting : Athens Radio.				[Exit B.C.

									[Enter C. Hill.

A.L.B.	Reluctant to recommend this retrograde course.  But satisfied it is necessary.

	Recognise international objns.

	But must give Govr. this support, if talks break down.

P.M.	Mtgs. with Harding.  Formula agreed : counter-assurances by Makarios drafted.  Talks will break if we can’t get Makarious to give counter-assurances.  Hope for U.S. support.

	Local posn. is improvg.  Better intelligence.



P.M.	No statement re jamming, at any rate until we are asked.



C.H.	Gks. will jam Cyprus station &amp; prs. B.B.C. Arabic b’casts.



P.M.	Govr. accepts loss of Cyprus station.



J.S.	Free speech enthusiasts will work up a fuss over this.



ALB.	Unlikely that Gks. wd. complain to U.N.  No point in our taking initiative there.

	Shall be ready with excerpts, wh. we cd. publish w’out delay.  Will put this in form of W. Paper &amp; hold it in readiness.



		Memo. approved.



							[Exit Ch. Hill., E.H. 

		3.	Newsprint.



P.T.	As in memo.  Promised to end control in 6 mos. fr. Sept. last if posn. of small newspp. cd. be safeguarded.  I can’t say that it will be safeguarded.  And all newspp. save Times want rationing to be continued.  But diffies. about method.  Times wish to print 24 p. paper on special paper, &amp; wd. surrender their newsprint.

	Plan of other papers wd. give Times only 15 pp.

	Minimum economic size for Times on new paper = 21 pp.  Suggest we give Times 21 pp. &amp; other papers what they propose.  And try to end rationing before end of ’56.  	More chance of ending it if Times is larger.



H.M.	Mechanical printing paper hasn’t bn. rationed for years.  If Times choose to use it, let them – unrationed.

	Press were given freedom to import because was known there wasn’t more to buy.  They shd. be warned now tht. they won’t be allowed to import more newsprint than they are already committed to buy – wtr w’in the ceiling or not.



P.T.	Press have bn. given import ceiling.

	Can’t give Times freedom, while others are subject to that limit.

	H.M.’s suggn. wd. be a new approach to Press.

	I cd. ask them to keep us informed of their purchasing p’mme.



H.M.	Ceiling was put v. high because we knew it was unattainable.

	We must now say “no fresh commitments”, irrespective of ceiling.



P.T.	This is new policy.



		Agreed :	Ty. and B/Trade to discuss and report back to 			Cabinet.
