C.M.24(56)							21st March, 1956





		1.	Parliament.					[Enter E.H.



R.A.B.	Business for next week.





		2.	Malta.



A.L.B.	2 mtgs. with 1922 Cttee.  Of speakers, 3 to 1 were against Rpt.  92 attended this 2nd. mtg : at the 1st. most of time occupied by Ministers.

	V. strong body of hostile opinion. 

	Mintoff, whose posn. in Malta is strong, may suggest a free vote at W’minster knowg. that Labour Party wd. then carry it.  Our objn. to that is a Party objn.

	In debate before Easter we cdn’t now have motion approving.  A motion takg. note mght be subject of amendmt. fr. our side.  I wd. therefore prefer debate on adjournment.

	Still think there shd. be some debate before Easter.  Our domestic diffies. will be no less after Easter : &amp; sitn. in Malta is bound to be worse.  The R.C. authies. won’t try to reach an agreemt. before debate in Parlt.  Mintoff wd. begin to stir up trouble in dockyard : mght be excommunicated :wd then move much further to left.



R.A.B.	Discussed with 1922 Executive.  Don’t under-estimate diffy.  At least 50% of Party are uneasy : 40-50 are definitely opposed.

	Feeling tht. religious issue shd. not be raised in Holy Week.  This point is being put by non-conf. as well as R.C.’s &amp; in Labour Party too.

	In a debate ALB wd have to put a view.  If so, we shd. have to consider v. carefully what he says.  E.g. Parlt. havg. as much say as Malta.



A.L.B.	If Labour took this view on Holy Week &amp; succeeded in impressing it on Mintoff, I wd. take difft. view.  But many of those who make this suggn. are seekg. only means of delay.



E.H.	Labour Whips have sent message discouraging debate in Holy week.

	Debate on adjournment wdn’t do because involves legn.  Take note motion is inevitable : can avoid Govt. supporters’ amendment.



P.M.	Beware of Labour interest in this viz., to split Tories.

	Real risk of trouble in Malta.  Shall then be told it’s due to Govt’s not makg. up their mind.  How handle a real row in Malta?  cf. diffies. in ’30’s when it was Italy.

	Dissidents in Party shd. be told what they risk i) to Tory Party &amp; ii) to Malta.



K.	I agree – We shan’t hold posn. in Malta.  Mintoff will go to extremes.



P.M.	Remember there is no alternative policy for us to follow.

	Labour leaders wd. like it to be united decision of Parlt., &amp; counsel delay on that a/c : but, if it went sour, they wd. exploit the political advantage.



R.A.B.	Cd. we outline, in debate, our further stages – incldg. a second &amp; definitive debate in Parlt. at W’minster.



A.L.B.	Debate : statement after Easter : White Paper : two-stage Bill with second part (constitutional) coming into opn. later by Order.



P.M.	? Concede one point : no statement on Thursday (before Gd. Friday).



S.	Then how catch up on things said in debate.  Awkward to leave policy at large for 2 weeks after debate.



P.M.	ALB will have indicated a policy in the debate.



H.	Cd. he not make it clear tht., before Bill is introduced, there will be settlement with R.C. authies. and another Genl. Election.



A.L.B.	Either a settlement or an election.  If there is a concordat, there will be no need for election.



R.A.B.	We may be pressed to present a White Paper, after concordat, and before Bill.



H.M.	Or procedure by resolution.



A.L.B.	Or Wh. Paper accompanying a Bill (2-stage).



H.	Our Party will want an election – as well as concordat.



P.M.	Labour Party will accept that.



P.M.	Tell Oppn. we want debate on 26/3.  If it has to be put off, let it be at Oppn. request.

	Say : no statement on Thursday.  Will make our posn. clear in debate.

	Debate on “take note” Motion.

	If it is to be delayed, Labour Party must ask publicly for the p’ponement.



S.	Assume there is no evce. tht. R.C. authies. (in Malta) wd. dislike a debate in Holy Week.



A.L.B.	None that I have heard.  Cd. ask Govr. (telephone).



P.M.	On balance, I prefer to have debate on 26/3 &amp; will lead Labour Party in that direction.





3.	British Industries Fair.



P.T.	The orgn. has taken decn. well, but want early announcement because of their obligns. etc., to traders.

	Propose therefore to announce on Tuesd. – puttg. emphasis on B’ham section and future weight on overseas exhibns.



R.A.B.	I am content.



		Agreed.





		4.	Cost of Living.



I.M.	New Index will be announced to-morrow.  It is stable.  No change therefore as cpd. with 4 months ago.



	

5.	Middle East.



S.Ll.	SEATO Mtg. was successful.

	Kashmir : pathological feeling in Ind./Pak.

	Israel : pathological state vis-á-vis Egypt.

	Egypt : H’to we have assumed Nasser was best bet in M/E.  We must re-consider that view.  He is moving into R. arms.  He has built up his name as leader of Arab world, &amp; will have to find means of living up to it.  He won’t therefore seek or accept any settlement with Israel.

	Despite our talk, he has attempted to seduce Libya, has attacked our posn. in P. Gulf, &amp; contd. propaganda.  We must therefore assume his contd. hostility.

	We must therefore go for him, recognising that he will be formidable opponent.  Means : support B. Pact : draw Iraq &amp; Jordan more closely together : detach S. Arabia fr. Egypt (Nasser’s dreams are anti-monarchical) : support Libya : seek re-arrangemt. of affairs in Syria (now almost a Communist satellite) : stir up Sudanese to make diffies. over Nile waters.  More direct action v. Egypt, incldg. tapering off aid, backg. out of Aswan Dam, seekg. alternative régime.

	We can’t do this alone.  Must concert policy with U.S.



P.M.	Have discussed in smaller group.  Agree we must try to get U.S. along this line.  Won’t be easy to move Dulles.  If U.S. don’t join B. Pact v. soon, chance will be lost.

	N., tho’ astute, has little military strength.  We have reached Anglo/U.S. agreement – planners’ level – on action to be taken under Tripartite Decln.

	Worried about Libya.  Can we press U.S. again to pay?  Must encourage them.

	Must have forces at Aden &amp; Sharja thro’ this summer.



H.M.	Have told them to make temporary provision.	          [Enter Ll.G.

	m’while.  Will finalise this as soon as A.H. returns.



S.Ll.	Is it true tht. only limited no. of ships can stay in Gulf?  Hope we have enough tropicalised.



		Agreed :	W.M. to look into both ques.



S.	Support this view on Nasser.  Write him off – and see him off,

	using all practical means.  Pity we didn’t decide earlier to take this line.

	Tripartite Decln.  We can’t run out on it now.  Must make it a reality.



P.M.	What Israel needs is interceptors.  Fr. are sending some : they haven’t arrived.  Ask U.S. what more can be done on this.  We have sent some night Meteors.  Appalling to have to fight with Israel v. Arabs.  Must strengthen I. to forestall it. 	Agreed : add this to message to U.S.



H.M.	Must consider economic aspects of an anti-Nasser policy.

	Cttee. of officials : F.O., Ty. and B/T.



P.M.	We move quietly with this change in policy.



	

6.	East-West Trade.



S.Ll.	R.M. said tht. on balance he was in favour of sending these 100 tractors to China.  But, now, a further message saying this is a v. bad moment.



P.T.	We shall continue to be pressed to raise this in locum.



P.M.	V. irritating.  Fr. will cheat &amp; do it.  U.S. are v. unreasonable.



P.T.	V. awkward moment for us too because of diffies. of motor industry.



		Agreed :	Proceed as in para. 4 of R.M.’s 1st. telegram.



							[Exit E.H.

[Enter J.B.C.

		7.	Agriculture : Disciplinary Powers.		



R.A.B.	This is probly. right on merits : but awkward politically.  Ques of judgement.  But believe balance is in favour of going ahead.

	Price review has not had too bad a receptn. among farmers.  They wd.

		accept this enquiry more easily if we cd. at same time foreshadow

	y|	changes in price policy – in direction of longer-term stability.



H.A.	Timing is awkward.  Cdn’t expect report before July ’57.  Legn. wd. have to be undertaken in 1957/58 Session.

	Enforcemt. of Pt. II : has bn. allowed to lapse : v. awkward to resume it.  But security of tenure is even more urgent : farming is becoming closed shop.

	We cdn’t act w’out independent report.



H.M.	Favour enquiry.



S.	These are 2 most awkward points for any Govt. to tackle.  Cd. we put it 

	x|	on positive basis : what diffies. prevent efficient young men fr. entering 

	  |	industry.  And allow disc. powers &amp; security/tenure to come in as 

	  |	consequential.



H.A.	Cdn’t rely on that.  Main obstacle : prosperity of industry.



P.M.	Danger of not being ready with the legn. until too late.



R.A.B.	Shall we consider x/.



H.A.	Then we make it, deliberately, a long-drawn affair – with a Rpt. after next election.



D.E.	The bad farmer can’t be got out because prices are too high &amp; he doesn’t go broke.

	I wd. like to see this combined with future of price policy.



H.A.	Enquiry as at x/ wd. or mght leave us w’out proposals on disciplinary powers.



		Agreed :	R.A.B. to re-consider, in light of x/ and y/.



			(H.M. and H.A.  Don’t link y/ with x/.)



							[Exit Att.G : Enter J.B.C.

8.	Legislative Programme.



		Not heard.



			Agreed :	R.A.B. to try to make bargain with Opposn. to 

					get 3 social service Bills.



								[Exit J.B.C., RAB., H.A.

	

9.	Economic Situation : White Paper.



R.A.B.	Will send in my comments.



J.S.	So will I.



H.M.	Advantage : shows it’s a national problem, not an act of Govt.



		Approved : subject to 



	

10.	Singapore.



P.M.	Must consider before Easter.



A.L.B.	Memo. in draft – will be circulated v. soon.
