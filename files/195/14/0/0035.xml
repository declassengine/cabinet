C.M.25(56)							27th March, 1956





		1.	Parliament.					[Enter E.H.



R.A.B.	Business for week after Recess.





		2.	Jordan.  (C.A.)



P.M.	Met y’day with C.I.G.S. on new basis for mil. mission.  Shall meet again to-day.  Posn. may arise in wh. we shd. authorise Amb. to tell King that, if Legion split &amp; civil war occurred, we wd. send in troops.

	Ask Cab. to agree in principle tht. if J. can be saved, we shd. take such action.  For if J. goes, Iraq wd. be undermined.



S.Ll.	Tel. to Amman last night.  Will circulate in boxes.		Agreed.

	King may have to be confronted with need for urgent &amp; strong action.  Or we may have to save him fr. an officers’ coup.



P.M.	

CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000





S.Ll.	[Have suggd.] to King tht. he shd. get rid of these offrs. before they get rid of him.

	If King were thrown out, we cdn’t put him back except with Iraq – tho’ they wd. be anxious to act.



S.	Add that Duke can promise mil. support if conversation goes that way &amp; King gives him opportunity to make the offer.



P.M.	I think we cd. go so far as that.				Agreed.



	

3.	Cyprus.



P.M.		Tel. (Cyprus) tht. Voice of America are b’casting to Cyprus inciting to 		violence.



A.L.B.	Verifying.  They will say they don’t control use of their time.



S.Ll.	Have asked R.M. to take it up in W’ton.



P.M.	Also send for Aldrich &amp; rub it in.  Damage to Anglo. U.S. relns.

								[Exit E.H.

[Enter A.J.

		4.	Coal.



A.J.	N.C.B.’s new developmt. p’mme.  In first five yrs. of natn. a few quick returns : exhausted by ’51.  Major schemes take longer to show results in increased output.  They do so, tho’ offset by decline in older pits.

	Present powers to borrow (£300 M) will be exhausted by end/July.  N.C.B. ask for another £400 M.  Reduced to £350 – on a/c of some investment fr. earnings &amp; some contince. of deficit.

	Must, however, examine actual investment year by year, in light of performance.



H.M.	Must increase the powers.  But picture is grim.  Where is this money to come from?

	Points :  i)  N.C.B. booklet not wholly in line : refers to £400 M.

		 ii)  Excessive hopes of at. energy – as deterrent to recruitment 	      at all technical levels.

	Can we not make it clear tht. N.C.B. booklet hasn’t got Govt. authority?



A.J.	It is their document.  I don’t wholly approve it.



R.A.B.	Its references to manpower are unjustified.  Endorse H.M.’s view of it.  Unrealistic document.



A.J.	N.C.B. have not adopted all my suggns. for improvement of document.



H.M.	Must agree a formula, for use of publn. &amp; on 2nd. Rdg. of Bill, that

	x|	this is not our document &amp; we don’t endorse it in full.



		Memo. approved, subject to considn. of y/.

	  	(2) Agreed as at x/.  Terms to be agreed with H.M.



H.M.	y|	Mght be easier if our figure was not so near to £400.  E.g. £300 instead of £350.



Ll.G.	Starting too much at once.  In 8 years only 8% completed.



A.J.	I agree : they did.  As Socialists did on housing.  Must watch this in future.

	Underground gas-ification.  Experiment is promising.  Who shd. carry it further?  N.C.B. are prejudiced against it.  May be diff., however, to entrust it to others.



		Agreed : 	maximum annual rate of £75 M. for

	   			(1) 4 or 5 years.  Borrowing powers.

								[Exit A.J. 

[Enter A.H.

		5.	Territorial Army Bounty.			



A.H.	Volunteer element in T.A. is valuable.

	Can’t count messing allowances (£10) as part of bounty : for all offrs., volunteers or not, get that &amp; it goes direct to Mess.

	Unprecedented to give less to offrs. than to other ranks.

	Will make the saving elsewhere, in T.A. expenditure.

	To decline it wd. produce disproportionate ill-will.

	Cost = 50% of price of one tank.



H.M.	1954 : plans for new bounties £800.000 for all Services.  These were rejected.  Nos. of volunteers has risen, despite gloomy prophecies.

1955 : plan for £400.000 odd was produced.  Ty. counter-proposals were produced in 24 hrs., in Dec. last.  [£10.]

	If £10 is worse than nothg. let us save £220.000.

	There are enough offrs. in T.A. already.  No evce. tht. they are out of pocket after camps.

	O. ranks had £12 when offrs. had nil.  There are precedents for giving officers smaller bounties than o. ranks.			[Enter J.S.

	“Saving elsewhere.”  If it can be made, it shd. be made anyway.

	Estimates are still £200 M. above those of last year.  We must make savings wherever we can.



A.H.	There was no agreement on this.  W.O. have always said it is indefens. to give lower bounty to offrs.

	We have cut £100 M. off Service Estimates.  This cut of £100.000 will cause quite disproportionate ill-will.



H.A.	Para. 3.  As old T.A. officer, I know what grievance this can cause.



A.H.	I wd. sooner have given more than £10.  But Fortescue in H/L. said unfortunately “it is being worked out.”



S.	Para.5(c) is a fair offer, surely.

	Dept. Minister is in best posn. to judge effects, in terms of ill-will.

	Not quite reasonable to say tht. offsetting economies shd. be made anyhow.



H.M.	What about Serv. Pay – demand for retrospective, at addl. cost of £6 M.  Was said morale wd. be ruined.  Was it.

	If this is authorised, I wd. reject offer in para.5(c).



J.S.	T.A. is a cheap service.  Don’t like cheese-paring on it.



R.A.B.	Pay concession by Ty. was v. large.



H.M.	x|	I will agree to £25 – of which £15 in cash and £10 in messing allowance.



		Agreed : as at x/.





6.	Singapore.



A.L.B.	Can’t stand alone.  If not with Malaya, wd. turn to China.  But Malaya doesn’t want to be saddled with S. until their own posn. has bn. consolidated.

	Aim therefore must be Fedn.

	M’while, how to m’tain security etc.,  Marshall &amp; the Chinaman.

	Para. 14.  Something cd. safely be done.  Eg. (i)

But view of Govr.  Intern. security is now responsibility of Council of Ministers : &amp; Govr. thinks tht. in practice he cdn’t over-ride it.  Hence para. 14(iii) wd. be regarded in S. as retrogressive.  V. unwelcome advice.

	Worried about chain of command fr. Govr. to chief of police.  Have suggd. to Govr. a possible way out : rather complicated.

       *	Wd. wish to circulate memo. on this ques of internal security &amp; seek views of colleagues before resumed Cab discn. after Easter.

	Opinion here wd. not be surprised at trouble in S. 	[Re-enter E.H.

	But we want to have good ground on which to break, if we must.



P.M.	Impressed by Rob. Scott’s warnings of danger of drift.  Conflictg. advice fr. him &amp; Govr – will be awkward.

	We can’t relax control over internal security.



W.M.	C.O.S. are considerg. strategic sitn. – &amp; problems of re-inforcement.



H.	Message fr. Menzies.  No concession of internal security because of its link with defence.  Suggests undertakg. fr. Marshall on link.



								[Exit A.H.

7.	Malta.



A.L.B.	Indications in debate that some of more serious objectors on Govt. side are coming round to acquiescence in Govt. view.

	Concldg. words in debate.



P.M.	I authd. this : it was inevitable to show firm intention to make announcemt. before Easter.



A.L.B.	Draft announcement.



E.H.	Still some feeling in Party.  Don’t know how some will vote on legn. when it comes.



J.S.	Disturbed at constitutional consequences.  Para. 61 &amp; 62 of offl. report.

	Scottish nationalism may get a fillip from this.  But I hope I am wrong.  I admit there are no signs of it yet.  Shd. hate to waken that sleeping dog.



R.A.B.	Don’t see 1922.  Make the statement – 28/3.		Agreed.



							[Exit E.H.



8.	The Horn of Africa.



H.M.	No chance to consider.		Adjourned.





	9.	

CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000





	

10.	Iron and Steel Prices.



P.T.		Prices controlled at 15% below overseas sale price.  

		Bd. now propose increase wh., with scrap consequential, means 4½% increase : 4¼ – 4½%.

		I advise that we raise no objn.  It is in short supply &amp; under-priced.  Cd. argue tht. there is case for no price control. (?)

		Price of scrap.  Gap (shd. be £2 a ton) has bn. widened by control to £8-10.  Shdn’t grow wider.



D.S.		Bd. shd. be allowed to do its job.  It’s their responsibility.  



P.T.	Don’t propose to challenge Bd.’s view.  Merely asked them to give me advance informn.



D.S.	Increase in scrap price is necessary to ensure colln.



H.M.	Home prices shd. rise.  Arguable they shd. go higher.  Higher price abroad forces out exports : shortage at home has to be met by increased imports.

	Suggest we take note of this.  	But hope P.T. will continue to consider wtr price control (i.e. equalisation of prices of imported &amp; home-produced steel) shd. be discontinued – as under an earlier Cab. concln.

	If we don’t limit imports by physical controls, we must allow price mechanism to work.



		Agreed :	Take note of this : increase scrap prices.

				Let genl. ques be considered at E.P.C. : &amp; rpt.

				be made to P.M.

	

11.	British Council.



R.A.B.	Will it do any good?

	Will waken another sleeping dog.



H.M.	I will wear this subject to omission of “hope”.



P.M.	Consider wtr it can’t be done w’out public statement e.g.

	commn. to Apptmts. Bds.



		Agreed.
