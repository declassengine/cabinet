C.M.32(56)							3rd May, 1956



							[Enter Att.G., E.H. Reading



		1.	Parliament : Sel. Cttee. on Nationalised Industries.



R.A.B.	Coal Industry Bill.  Defer to 10/5 in order to enable Cab. to consider Sel. Cttee. on natd. indies. &amp; make a statement before Bill is taken.  Wd. have to consult Oppn. first.



L.P.	Natd. industies. may be raised soon in H/L.  Reith shdn’t do it, because Chairman of Bd : but he or someone else may raise it.



R.A.B.	Spens will preside over small Select Cttee. : will see us thro’ this session, on experimental basis.  T. of r : to study reports &amp; accounts of natd. indies. – on level of P.A.C.  Membership : 6 Tories, 4 Labour, 1 Liberal. The narrower t. of r. wd. be more likely to be acceptable to Opposn.



P.T.	Politically inevitable.  But qua m/govt., monstrous.  Load on Minister will be v. much greater.



R.A.B.	Can’t find Parly. time for more debates : cd. manage few more P.Q.’s.



D.S.	‘Reports’ will cover whole field of policy.  Cd. they discuss e.g. wages claims.



R.A.B.	If we do nothing, doubt if our Party will accept it.



H.M.	Remember we favoured this sort of thing in opposn.

	We can’t resist appln. of P.A.C. principle to natd. indies., esp. now we are financing them fr. Exchequer.



		Agreed :  Cab. to consider a memo. on Tuesday – next.





		2.	Parliament.



R.A.B.	Business for next week.

	Finance Bill 9/5.





		3.	Restrictive Trade Practices Bill.



K.	Amendmt. by Simon affectg. Crown privilege : effect wd. be to give discretion to a Judge vice Minister.  Wd. need ½ day argument, &amp; wd. make it imposs. to get Cttee. stage completed next week.

	We have bn. considerg. ques &amp; now have a report.  Expld. to Simon in attempt to get him to w’draw amendmt.  He has w’drawn qua Cttee. stage, but may raise it on Rpt.

	Suggest a few Ministers shd. consider report v. quickly – so that Govt. have a line on Rpt. Stage.

							[Exit P.T., Att. G., E.H.





4.	Jordan.



R.	Not intended to give these assurance now.  Only to have authority to do it when suitable.



W.M.	C.O.S. agree.



P.M.	Accords with plans discussed in Def. Cttee.  Hold airfields &amp; see how it goes.



	

5.	Lung Cancer.						[Enter R.T.



P.M.	Amendment of para. 4 of Draft.



“The Govt. will take such steps as are necessary to ensure that the public are kept informed of all relevant informn. as and when it becomes available.”



R.T.	Content with that.				Agreed.



I.M.	Don’t accept argument in para. 2.  Lung cancer is first killer among single diseases.  Can only be put lower by lumping together other diseases in groups., e.g. all heart disease.



R.T.	Put in figure for “all cancer” deaths, of which 85 lung cancer.



H.M.	? Inform tobacco cos. in advance.

								[Exit R.T.





6.	Parliament : Remuneration of Members.



R.A.B.	Oppn. have now indicated tht., if we don’t act, they will make public protest &amp; ask for public enquiry.

	If we don’t act, v. diff. to defend posn. of Junior Ministers.

	Is this right time to proceed?

	On M.P.’s Oppn. prefer £1500 p.a.

	My inclination is still to act quickly, in advance of public agitn.  But 1922 Chairman &amp;Party Chairman both think it wd. cause v. much trouble among Govt. supporters.

	But it is for Cab. to decide.



P.M.	Further talks with T.U.C. &amp; employers.  H.M. believes tht. a rise in c/living of 2 points – cpd. with 7 points in wages – cd. be made a ground for pressing industry to hold it at this level for 12 months : wages &amp; prices.

	A v. important move for Govt. to make.

	If we cd. get this, it wd. be a good ground fr. which to deal with industrial strife if we get it.

	Tho’ this isn’t large in figures, it will get mixed up with rising wages : our supporters will say “They look after themselves but ask others to stand still”.



H.M.	This memo. shows what you cd. do if you decided to act.

	Believe, on inflation, we may be approachg. a turn.  Labour is a little less fully employed.  This will be the year of destiny.  If we had £5 M. wages rise this autumn, we shd. be finished.  Moderate T.U. leaders 

	x|	won’t, I fear, have power to ask for restraint.  But events may help 

	  |	them.  If, in some industry, employers refuse a claim, hands of moderate leaders wd. be strengthened.

	Better therefore to keep out of this.  Will seem, not end of last wage round, not beginning of next.



P.M.	Cd. we do Junior Ministers alone, and leave the rest.



B.H.	Support that.  Must be done before long.



R.A.B.	Fear we can’t do that w’out setting off claims for Members.



H.M.	Bill wdn’t pass until near end of Session.  By Xmas we shd. know where we stand.  



I.M.	Jan/Feby. is more likely.  Summer is best time for doing this : if p’poned, it shd. be p’poned for 12 months.



R.A.B.	If we allow Labour to take initiative in pressing for this, we shall have to bow to it in the end – tho’ we might hold it for the summer.



I.M.	Best time of year is immediately after Whitsun – because of conferences.  And better do it sooner vice later in this Parlt.  Therefore, I think I wd. do it this summer.



H.M.	Repeated argument at x/.



L.P.	Agree with x/ as reason v. raising salaries.  Cd. we not do something on basis of refunding expenses – or allowing them tax free.



P.M.	Then you wd. be lead to concln. i) raise sessional allowances by £1.  

y|	ii) start allowances for Peers.  iii) one-clause Bill allowg. junior Ministers to have whole of Parly. salary.



R.A.B.	Outside enquiry?  Balance of opinion against.



H.M.	Choice is between y/ now or wait until end/year and bring in somethg. like scheme Y.



S.	Junior Ministers in H/L.  They shd. have £2000, as in scheme X.



L.P.	Wd. they manage pro. tem. on £3 allowance?



P.M.	On balance, I wd. prefer to wait for a real settlement instead of trying y/.  Saying m’while tht. we wd. like to be able to do this &amp; will proceed as soon as we can.



R.A.B.	Tell Oppn. we must wait because of economic situation.

	Consider y/ only if there is gt. trouble in holding it.



R.A.B.	Members’ Supn. Fund.  a) Exchequer contn.  b) Tax relief on 	}

Members’ Contns.							}Agreed

	Also consider wtr any more cd. be done for Junior Ministers 	}

on tax relief, Peers as well as Commoners.				}



E.H.	If Oppn. table a Motion on a Supply Day, I wd. not want free vote.





		7.	Coal Prices.				[Enter A.J. Nugent.



P.M.	This will at least give hope of reducg. deficit – unlike earlier increases.

	It is w’in the 2 points rise in c/l index.



Ll.G.	x/ in p. 2.  My experience : claim for lowest paid : then along come others for m’tenanance of differential.  Is this still the method?



A.J.	Yes.  It assumes tht. consequential is inevitable.



P.M.	Don’t put around the pessimism of y/ in para. 5.



A.J.	I’m not doing so.  But firms are showg. reluctance to convert.



I.M.	9% increase in wages with no increase in productivity – this is the kind of thing that encourages spiral.



N.	Effect on fishing.  Will mean £½ M. more on subsidy : will be claim for that.  



H.M. 	Which we will consider : not automatic.



N.	Cost increases in horticulture.



		Memo. approved.				[Exit A.J., N.





		8.	Gold Coast.



A.L.B.	Nkrumah has now agreed to my insistence on a further test of public opinion on constitutional issue.  Wishes me to announce it.  I wd. prefer that.  Will announce on 10 or 11 May that Genl. Election will be held.

	Wd. be valuable if Parly. Delegn. went out to observe election.



D.S.	Regret our Colonial policy.  Don’t think it’s wise to help people to win self-government.



A.L.B.	This is a delay.



D.S.	But I regret the union.  Ashanti cd. have bn. encouraged to stand out against it.



A.L.B.	Election wd. be July – after P.M. Mtg.





9.	Tangier.



P.M.	Our interest is only in free port.  That we might get.  So we wd. be ready to discontinue International Control.

	But Fr. and Spain have more &amp; different interests.  May be more reluctant to let it go.



H.M.	May Ty. be consulted before telegrams are despatched.



P.M.	B/T. and C.O.S. have bn. consulted &amp; agree.



		Decision deferred until Cab. in afternoon.
