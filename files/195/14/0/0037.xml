C.M.27(56)							10th April, 1956





		1.	Middle East.					[Enter E.H.



S.Ll.	Advise we warmly welcome President’s statement.  F.O. spokesman need offer no further comment.

	Then tell U.S. we assume it includes action w’in U.N. or under Tr. Decln.

	But what do we say if asked wtr we have made plans for mil. action.  Think we must say planning is well-advanced to discharge HMG.’s obligns. under either head.  U.S. won’t admit to joint planning.



W.M.	Plans only cover study of possibilities.  No plans for mil. action alone.  Always assumed joint action.



P.M.	If U.S. will play, we can act under Decln.  But if U.S. are moving twds U.N. action, we can’t act alone under Decln.  Our object is to prevent a war not become engaged in one.



S.Ll.	Statement was made to retrieve President’s statement at Press conference.



P.T.	We can w’stand  X-examinn. on state of mil. planning.



D.S.	Were we consulted on statement?



S.Ll.	No.  But we can say we are in constant touch.



P.M.	Involvement in war, on either side, wd. split public opinion here.



S.Ll.	Determinn. of aggressor : U.S. plan is to use U.N. method of calling on both sides to w’draw so naming as aggressor the power which fails to comply.



H.A.	Avoid any unilateral oblign. 		Agreed.



D.S.	Make sure that, if we are involved, we get some practical advantage out of it.



S.Ll.	For form, will ask Fr. what they cd. do.  So tht. we can say that we have made approaches to both the other signatories of Tr. Decln.



P.T.	Arms for Israel?  To increase their defensive strength.	Agreed.



S.Ll.	They are getting some fighter aircraft.  They are askg. for Centurions.  



P.M.	Awkward.  Easier to give anti-tank weapons.  



S.Ll.	Awkward to make public reference to this, in view of Jordan situation.



P.M.	Shd. we see Gaitskell?  



S.Ll.	He has bn. told i) mil. talks are procdg. with U.S.  ii) we are going to give some arms to Israel. 

	I cd. say in addn. to ii), tht. any public statement wd. increase our difficulties.





2.	Disarmament.



S.Ll.	Soviets will try to make cold-war capital out of their plan.  It is v. vague on powers of control organ.  It has no reference to nuclear disarmt.

	Must put it in perspective.  Propose to indicate, in H/C., the defects of the plan but say we are continuing to talk.



S.	Nuclear chapter.  Stages &amp; periods.  Relieved tht. this wdn’t start until agreemt. reached on conventional.  But R. now seem more willing to reach agreemt. on conventional.  Then we may be exposed to reality on nuclear chapter.



H.M.	Yes : for we shan’t have stock of nuclear weapons for some years.

	U.S. and R. are ahead of us.



S.Ll.	If R. plan were accepted &amp; no restn. were placed on nuclear, all sorts of countries wd. start on nuclear development.  We must at some stage have a prohibn.  Safeguard for us is that R. won’t accept provisions for control.



K.	Doubt this.  Nuclear power is our answer to their superiority in nos.  R. therefore say : v. well, let us concentrate on conventional.  Can we therefore blame them for making no provn.  on nuclear?



S.Ll.	We have always argued in favour of a comprehensive plan.



S.	Fr. line : see what we can agree on &amp; p’pone the rest.  That isn’t safe for us.



H.M.	If we discuss conventional &amp; p’pone nuclear, it shd. be on understandg that first doesn’t come into force before agreemt. reached on 2nd.



S.	But we shd. then be vulnerable to pressure on nuclear – wh. is our only guarantee for peace.



H.M.	Wd. be safe if you cd. keep discussions going for 2 years or so.



		Agreed :	S.Ll. to discuss with S. and W.M. draft of

				a statement in H/C. after Ques on 11/4.





3.	Parliament.



RAB.	Business for next week.

	Budget on 17/4 : to continue on 18 and 19/4 : and be completed on 23/4.





		4.	Parliament : Remuneration of Ministers &amp; Members.



R.A.B.	Leakage to S. Express.  Re-actions from our supporters, may be awkward.  Our 3 point plan is imperilled.

	Must first ascertain views of supporters.

	Leak apparently from Socialist sources.



J.S.	Urgency of action on junior Ministers’ salaries.



H.A.	Agree.



H.M.	We shd. do that, &amp; expenses of Peers.  To carry them, must do Members’ salaries.  But don’t start with the last – wd. lose the other two.  Must be a package.

	Want to do it before recess.  When?  Just before recess?



R.A.B.	Aim at that &amp; quieten our supporters m’while.



							[Enter B.C.



5.	Family Allowances.



H.M.	Take opportunity of this Bill to give 2/= for 3rd. and further children – to offset final disappearance of bread subsidy.

	N. Ass. Bd. looks after the v. poor.  This wd. look after the big families.  Mention in Budget : give effect to it in Bill.



R.A.B.	Won’t be popular with our supporters.  They don’t like family allowances.  But it is right method of dealing with large families.

	What wd. be cost of incldg. 2nd. child?  



H.M.	V. heavy.



R.A.B.	Will this make Bill more controversial?  Bigger anyway.  We must put it thro’ before July – not leave it to spill-over.



H.A.	Food Survey shows again that we are all doing better except families with 3 children or more.



I.M.	Support social philosophy of this proposal.



D.E.	Contemplate removg. subsidy on school-meals.  Don’t use arguments on this wh. wd. involve us in quid pro quo.  Not sure we shd. be able to go on with that plan if the link is emphasised.



H.M.	Shan’t emphasise this v. much.



D.E.	Mght be wiser to announce change in school meals system now, in Budget.



B.C.	School-meals were linked with f. allowances in 1945 Wh. Paper.



H.M.	I will consider wtr I shd. not say somethg about school meals in Budget speech.



D.E.	Announce it so that you can make it clear this 2/= is a part counterpart.  Otherwise, we may have to make another increase in f. allowances on that a/c.



		Agreed :	RAB and D.E. to consider this ques and consult

				with H.M.

				Subject to this, memo. approved.



B.C.	i)  Such a link wd. sharpen pressure to extend the 2/= to 2nd. child.  ii) Too close a link with bread will provoke pensioners.



							[Exit B.C.

								[Enter P.M.G.

6.	Post Office Finances.				



Ch.H.	Want to mark relation betwn. charges &amp; salaries.  In addn., extra pension costs : awards of wage increases to postmen &amp; engineers.  Total cost : £20 M.  Propose to meet £15 M. by increase charges – leaving £3 M. to be met by economies and £2 M. by redn. of surplus.

	Method.  3d. letter wd. raise £6 M.  But it makes £10 M. profit.  And wd. leave un-raised printed paper rate, wh. loses £4 M.  To do both wd. raise more on posts than we need.  Also admin. awkward &amp; politically unpopular.

	Propose therefore that we shd. not raise letter charge to 3d.



P.M.	Don’t want to make letter (poor people) pay for telephones etc., (richer people).



H.M.	I don’t favour it : esp. as it wdn’t raise whole sum needed.	Agreed.



Ch.H.	No increase in overseas rates.  



P.T. 	Good, qua exports.  

Annex A.  All items save two are makg. a loss. viz., cheap evening trunk calls and p. orders.  But : peak of tel. traffic is now v. often in the evening.  P. order increase will be criticised : 2d. on a 6d. order!  Cd. raise this, alternatively, by cutting maximum of 2/= on evening trunk calls.  Max. of 2/6 wd. then operate &amp; £1 M. more wd. be raised.



J.S.	Prefer to get the money on telephones.		Agreed.

	No change at all on p. orders. 			[Exit P.M.G.

[Enter Hare.



		7.	I.L.O. Convention.				



I.M.	Our failure to ratify is now being exploited v. us – in Colonies &amp; foreign countries.

	Recommend we now ratify.



W.M.	Was a v. narrow issue previously.  Support this proposal.



J.H.	No C.O. objn. : dependent territories will be brght in only to the extent practicable.



H.A.	Agree.



P.M.	Can’t we avoid White Paper?  



R.A.B.	Hope we can.  



I.M.	Will consider alternative of P.Q. 

							[Exit Hare.

[Enter Att. G.

8.	Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill.



Ll.G.	Must not appear to support wrecking amendments.

	Quite a few abolitionists on Govt. side are now ready for compromise e.g. on amendmts. relatg. to police or prison officers.



E.H.	Many wd. support Lucas Tooth’s amendment.



R.A.B.	Suppose we advise H/L. to accept this amendment &amp; then get defeated.  Where do we stand then?



J.S.	Diffy. about para.12.  Support this view – tho’ awkward for me.



R.A.B.	Work thro’ private Members – even on some of amendments in App. 2.



		L.P.S. to discuss with K., LL.G., J.S., Att.G. &amp; E.H.

		and resume discn. later mtg.



H.	Consider wtr Silverman wd. drop Bill if some of these amendments were carried.



K.	If H/L. gave it 2nd. Rdg, the tidying-up amendments cd. be done in Cttee. stage there.

								[Exit Att. G.

									[Enter H.W.

9.	Transport Commission : Finances.			



H.W.	Transport Tribunal have advised tht. freight charges shd. be increased by 10%.  But they have given analysis wh. shows tht. B.T.C. are v. near to posn. in which they can’t pay their way, as requd. by statute.  This confirms need for action we have taken.

	But w’in next 6 mos. I may have to ask Cab. to face ques wtr B.T.C. can discharge its statutory obligation.



H.M.	Another nail in coffin of natn.

	The Act required the business to be run at a profit.  But that can’t be ensured by Act of Parlt.



W.M.	The posn. was nearly as bad before natn.



P.T.	We shd. not at this stage say anything to imply that we may abandon the statutory oblign.



H.M.	Some will argue tht. this shows we were wrong in giving 6 mos’ moratorium.  Others that B.T.C. is bust anyway.



	

10.	Bagdad Pact : Meeting of Council.



H.M.	i)  Kashmir.  C.R.O. wish me to stop any reference to it in communiqué.  Must I avoid it, at all costs.  Pakistan &amp; Turkey will press it : on grds. tht. P. can’t do its job under Pact w’out being secure in the rear.



H.	Can’t have another such reference, as at S.E.A.T.O.



P.M.	But cdn’t break Bagdad Pact for sake of avoiding offence to India.



H.	Cd. send message to Govr. Genl. urging him not to bring it up again.

		Agreed.



P.M.	At worst, accept somethg. on lines of S.E.A.T.O. reference.



W.M.	ii) Delegation.  Dickson is unwell.



P.M.	Take C.A.S. [plus junior from Keightley’s staff : if you need addn.]
