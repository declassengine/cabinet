C.M.33(56)							3rd May, 1956 – 5p.m.





		Singapore.



A.L.B.	Original proposals were quite unacceptable – “guidance” on fr. affairs, no safeguards for internal security.

	Our plan was then tabled.  Marshall took it fairly well, but has since bn. subject to pressure fr. Left-wing of his Delegation.

	He has now put fwd. draft memo. &amp; Indep. Bill.  Concessions – 

	i)  all external affairs reserved to U.K. – only trade &amp; commerce to local Govt.  Tho’ they have now asked also for ‘cultural relns.’ wh. mght be sinister.

	ii)  full rights on defence to U.K.  But references to “defence installations” suggest they will limit our control over internal security.

	iii) safeguards re future local govts. altering present agreements.

	iv) U.K. right of day-to-day contact with Police.  Won’t have Commr. on Security Council : they prefer a security liaison officer – we cd. accept that.  They accept a Public Service Commn. for police apptmts.  We must retain right to appoint Chief of Police, Deputy &amp; Head of Sp. Branch.

	v) Right to suspend constitn. &amp; resume direct rule – at discretion of H. Commr.  But total suspension wd. be our only recourse.

	vi) “Independence” Bill.  Cd. we introduce such a Bill in Parlt. at present time?  Effect wd. be shattering.  In any event, it is not true independence.

	Our difficulties –

	a) They are publicly committed to (vi).  We mght have a Govt. of Singapore (Self-Govt.) Bill &amp; urge them to accept posn. tht. further stages must await fedn.

	b) Internal security.  Our control wd. last only 6 years &amp; even then we cdn’t intervene until situation had already deteriorated to “emergency” stage.

	My remedies for either diffy. may lead to breakdown.

	Alternatives : i) reserve executive power to Govr. to act.  ii) reserve legislative power for him to resume powers by legislation.  (iii) power to suspend constitution.



L.P.	Can’t have a fraud Bill.

	Can’t have posn. in wh. we can’t intervene until emergency has arisen.

	Better therefore to allow Conference to break down than accept this.



H.	Must have reserve powers.  A &amp; N.Z. wd. insist.

	Independence must also be avoided.

	A &amp; N.Z. wd. support A.L.B.’s line.  Mght delay talks so as to get explicit support fr. them.



D.S.	No commitment on fedn. with Malaya.



W.M.	“Independence” wd. be too great a shock.

	The transitional period – six years’ maximum, reviewed every 2 years.  This is far too short.  Cdn’t accept it.

	Nor cd. we accept provisions on security – wh. gives us right to intervene when internal sitn. has deteriorated so far as to threaten safety of defence installations – &amp; then requires us to suspend whole sitn.



Ll.G.	Importce. of m’taining morale of police.  Illustrated in B. Guiana, Cyprus.  Also intelligence.

	Importce., qua security, of state of public opinion.  Not merely danger to defence installations.



R.	Independence wd. be a shock, not only to Commonwealth countries, but also to foreign members of SEATO.



R.A.B.	Can’t take risks on fortresses – especially after Ceylon development.



H.M.	Intermediate action before suspending constitn.  On what officers will Govr. rely for help. – in either contingency for that matter?



A.L.B.	Wd. depend on loyalty of police – and, on 2nd. phase, troops.



H.M.	Reliability of Police Commr., and some small staff, is almost more important that powers.

	Right to suspend “in whole or in part” is what is needed.  And organisation wh. will enable Govr. to act.



P.M.	Havg. made it clear that we can’t accept, in fortress, posn. in which we have no power to intervene save in emergency : surely we cd. convince them that we don’t want always to have to use hammer to crack nuts.



P.M.	Fedn. with Malaya.  Share D.S. view : not on merits, but because of present state of politics in Singapore.



A.L.B.	Agree we must be careful over this.  No commitment.	Agreed.



P.M.	We shd. see how we break.  Not enough to have only emergency powers.  In their interest tht. Govr. shd. have power to do less than this, at all times.  Discuss minimum powers for this purpose : and if these can’t be conceded, we break negotns.



D.S.	No time-table cd. be accepted at this stage.			Agreed.



A.L.B.	W. r. to R.’s observn. : breakdown will be followed by state of disorder in Singapore which will equally dismay SEATO powers.

	There are 3½ Br. battns. in Singapore &amp; one in Malaya ready to go.



H.	A &amp; N.Z.  What more do we say?



P.M.	That we can’t rely on emergency powers alone : Govr. must have power to intervene earlier.

	Aim at getting their public support in event of breakdown.

	Consider wtr India mght follow suit.  Prs. not.
