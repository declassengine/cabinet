C.M.18(56)							5th March, 1956





		1.	Cyprus.				[Enter CIGS., C.A.S., 

									AN., E.H.



A.L.B.	Read draft statement.



P.M.	Breaking-points : amnesty (excln. of offences of carrying arms etc.,) : reservation of public order to Govr : the “elected majority”.



D.S.	Para. 11.  Shd. we not indicate why A’bishop’s attitude on these was unreasonable.



P.M.	In supplementaries – and in Press conferences.



S.	A’bishop is saying he has made all the concessions.  Shd. we not make it clear that it is we who have done so?



P.M.	Again – in supplementaries.  The corrn. makes it clear.



R.A.B.	Nominated members : wd. not be so numerous as to outweigh reasonable repn. of Greeks.



A.N.	Emphasise fact tht. A’bishop tried to draw us into bi-lateral discns. of Constitn., in advance of consultns. with all interests.



R.A.B.	Did A’bishop seem to want a settlement?



A.L.B.	No : I believe he is behind the campaign of violence : and using it to gain his own ends.



R.A.B.	They will ask for debate : don’t yet know what date they have in mind.  Possibly Wedy.



A.L.B.	Try to avoid it this week.





		2.	Jordan.



P.M.	Discns. y’day.

	Glubb’s posn.  Doesn’t take it v. dramatically.  Attached to J. and Legion.  Young King wantg. to run his own show – not unusual.  Duke, on other hand, in Tel. 355 takes a difft. view of causes.

	Glubb thinks King is uncertain &amp; wavering.  Believes he still favours Bagdad Pact.

	Glubb’s plan of carrying on is open to diffies. : – i) Br. offrs. can’t continue to exercise executive command.  Was proposg. to w’draw those.  Others who might become mission, mght stay pro. tem.  Cooke’s initiative is unfortunate : but we shd. have had to do it.

	Legion, w’out Br. offrs., will crumble.  If so, Jordan will too in the end – and be shared betw. other Arab States.  Nothg. we can do to stop that process with certainty.  We mght delay it.  I don’t favour course of trying merely to delay.  

	Message from Amman.

	Position of B. officers – formula approved.

	Position of wives and children.  Unwise on that a/c to be too dramatic.



R.A.B.	But much anxiety.  Shd. indicate tht. we are considering serious measures – not confined to J.  In fact, we may have to move closer to Israel and prs. unseat Nasser.



P.M.	We are more likely to transfer support elsewhere – e.g. re-inforce P. Gulf.



D.E.	H/C. re-action to w’drawg. Br. officers will be that it is sign of weakness.



I.M.	Also removing stabilising influence on frontier.



CIGS.	But, if not in command, they can’t be a stabilising influence.
