C.M.27(55)								28th July, 1955



									[Enter H.H.

		1.	Cyprus.



S.Ll.		C.O.S. memo.  Concln. in § 19.



P.M.	Drew attentn. to size &amp; complexity of mil. establmts. as shown on map.  Not much room left for Cypriots.



H.M.	But, however we restrict H.Q., Cyprus is needed as H.Q. &amp; transit base.  How preserve it for these purposes?  C.P.(55)94.  What type of plan are we eventually to table, at appte. moment, at confce.  Two main alternatives.  Had hoped to find practical plan on lines of A because B is traditional course wh. leads us to w’drawal.  But C.O. think somethg. like B. is inevitable : that means that at end of prescribed period we shd. have to reply on Turkish veto to keep us in Cyprus at all.



P.M.	Under a B. Plan, cd. you not try w’in period to make Cyprus a good place to live in &amp; build up some vested interests favouring our remaining there.



S.H.	Defence Treaty cd. be condn. of self-determination, at end of period – on Ceylon model.



P.M.	Turkish minority distinguishes C. from other places.  Wd. T. ever agree to C. joining with G.?



H.M.	Wd. like to see in Confce. how stout-hearted the Turks are on this.

	If they were v. tough, we might be able to run Plan A.  We mght adjourn for 2 wks., if we reached deadlock, so that Cab, cd. decide.



Sal.	Can we foresee any period when we cd. renounce our sovereignty over C.  If we do, we shall in C. be in same posn. as we were in E.

	Hard to wear w’drawal in one place in M/E.  Cdn’t stand two.  

	G. is less important to us than T.

	All this leads me to think tht. we can’t contemplate self-determinn. w’in this generation.



P.M.	Ready to “review” in 10 yrs. or so.  But don’t imply tht we will then concede self-determinn.  In 10 yrs. situation mght be quite different.



H.M.	Fear that it wd. build up expectn. of self-determinn. in 10 years.



H.H.	A.L.B. is not happy about Plan A.  Won’t be permanent because Enotist agitn. will continue.  Gks. (island or m’land) wd. never agree to Turks having any hand in C. Byron-ism in Greece.

   	 omit    [	Dy-archy with Gks., on a divn. of functions, is only practical way of

	      [	bringing Gks. in. 



P.M.	I cdn’t accept that exclusion of T. from island much nearer to T than it is to G.



H.H.	No support in C. for anything on lines of Plan A.



H.M.	I’m not wedded to Plan A.  My concern is to avoid use of words wh. will lead to expectns., on past history elsewhere, of self-determinn. in 10 yrs.  Cd. find a combination of A &amp; B.



P.M.	Plan A cd. be a starter in discn. tho’ it will be refused.



D.S.	What if neither plan is accepted?  Shan’t we have to sit it out?  What wd. that involve?  Isn’t that a third course?  Use the Conference to show that we are reasonable &amp; hope for enough world support to m’tain status quo.



H.H.	Some signs that Archbishop is now suspicious of too much intervention by Greece.  May get independence movement growing up vice Enotist.



H.M.	Para 1 (iii) of Plan B. is what makes me nervous.  It offers too much.  Cd. we not have somethg. rather more vague.  Is there somethg between that and “never”.



P.M.	Work fr. constitn. for x years &amp; we will then consult together – nothg. excluded from review.



	1.	H.M. to let Cab. know what he intends to say before he

		does so, in light of discussion.

	2.	S.Ll. to review plans for mil. establmts. in Cyprus.



P.M.	On 2.  We are not going to fight major war in M/E.  We hope to arm Arab (e.g. Iraq) to fight, and to have ourselves only 1 armoured divn. to help them.



H.M.	Jamming Gk. radio.  Reluctant to do this – esp. after Geneva discns. on free communication.  Do Cabinet agree?



P.M.	Weakens our posn. progressively.



H.H.	Our counter b’castg. is being developed, tho we haven’t yet got full cover.

									[Exit H.H.



	2.	Palestine.



H.M.	No joint decln.  No admn. tht. we had joined in workg. out this plan.  Admit tht. we had bn. consulted &amp; were in agreemt. on principles.  It will therefore be a U.S. initiative.

	Moreover, D.’s revised statement looks much less like a diktat.

In return we wanted  i)	U.S. support for Turko-Iraq Pact.

	ii)	U.S. to buy tanks for Iraq “off-shore” : 70 out

		of the 80 required.



P.M.	Sent Pres. E. a lr. on ii).  He was glad to know only 70 were needed to supplement 10 by us.  He promised to do his best to get this.  Recognised a) we had armour in M/E.  b) not good that U.S. shd. be sole supplier.  He asked, however, tht. if this was agreed we wd. begin supply immediately.



H.M.	Mustn’t tie up the tanks as condn. to concln. of Anglo-Iraq agreement.  Delay of this announcemt. will mean tht. Israsel will persuade U.S. Govt. to give them a unilateral guarantee.



S.Ll.	i) Cd. D. add verbal obeisance to idea tht. Arab refuges cd. return to Israel.  On part I. ii) On III omit “in every respect”.



R.A.B.	Don’t get pledged to £15m.  We mght get away with less.



H.M.	Will say : we will make some ????





	3.	Japanese War Criminals.



H.M.	New memo. shows how it wd. work out.

	No need to make announcement.  Just do it.



P.M.	Agree – wait until we are asked.



Sal.	Can’t resist this argument.  But I don’t like this.  Hope therefore we shan’t try &amp; get kudos with J. by making an announcement.



P.M.	Let us accept this (15 years) as principle, but review cases individually – so as to reserve right to keep for longer men who were especially brutal.



O.P.	On this basis, it wd. be unwise to consult Perceval.  That is inconsistent with doing it quietly.



S.Ll.	Tell him : he might stop agitn. fr. boiling up in his organn.





	4.	Legislation Programme.



 	H.C.	Doing better.  Shd. be well if Ministers will try to reach targets recommended.



R.A.B.	Hope to have Revenue Bill – wh. will shorten Fin. Bill.  Shd. be ready for introdn. in Oct.

	Pensions Increase Bill – can be brought to Cab, in Oct., to decide wtr or not we shd. go on with it.



Ll.G.	Shops (Hours) vice Geneva Conventions.



P.M. 	Don’t p’pone G.C. Bill too long.





	5.	Economic Situation.



R.A.B.	Effect on market was pronounced.  Ex Eq. A/c. has ?offered bid for sterling 6 mos. ahead at 2.80. : at once taken up.

	Credit restn. : opn. was delayed largely because Banks financing natd. indies. &amp; less able therefore to restrict private sector.  My statement on natd. indies. &amp; (public) Govt. exp’re will enable them to squeeze private borrowers more effectively.

	Drop in reserves in July will be marked.  Effect is being discounted because my statement.  Reasons : rumours of floating £: speculators’ belief tht. we were going convertible &amp; £ wd. begin by swinging down &amp; their action in losing sterling on that a/c.  World is now short of sterling, however, &amp; on techn. grds. a swing back on reserves is likely.

	I intend therefore to continue disinflationary policies at home, and to wait on exchange policy.  M’While, I shall say nothing.



		Noted.





	6.	 Newsprint.



P.T.	They will get 850,000 t. in ’55.  Ceiling is far above supply : they cdn’t obtain as much.

	“Times” resent control because they have found means of using other paper.

	“Express” want control retained because they don’t want “Times” to go on with their plan.

	Contracts betwn. home-mills &amp; newspp. are v. complex.  My aim : to get newspp. to re-negotiate contracts.  Mills are ready to do this &amp; to reserve supplies for smaller users.  Then I can see what happens.

	I may be defeated.  But at least it will then be clear that it’s not our responsibility that control continues.



P.M.	Let us make this effort to get rid of control.



R.A.B.	Cd. we re-impose control if small users can’t get their paper.



P.T.	Yes : my formula wd. allow that.



R.A.B.	Can take the risk involved for b/payments.



		Memo. approved.



	7.	Cabinet Procedure in Recess.



P.M.	No standing Cab. Cttees. in Aug.  Malta &amp; Cyprus Cttees may need mtgs.

	No Cab. in first 2 wks of Aug.  Thereafter, prs. a mtg per wk. attended by Ministers in or near Ldn.

	Sept. Cab. once a week.

		No standing Cttees.





	8.	China : Parliamentary Delegation.



H.M.	China have suggd. we send one.  Suggest we say : they may send an invitn. but, as we have so many visits to arrange, we fear it may not be poss. to arrange it for some time to come.



P.M.	Stall it – but care will be needed.
