C.40(55)							10th November, 1955





		1.	Parliament.				[Enter Ch. H., B.H., R.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Housing Bill.  Shd. it go to standing Cttee.?



D.S.	Will spin it out until March – nr. local Govt. elections.  Better to take it on floor, even with late sittings, and get it over more quickly.



W.	Support that view.



D.S.	Don’t want action (diff. rents scheme) beginning just before l.g. elections.



H.C.	Wait until we see how much time is likely to be needed in Cttee. on Fin. Bill.



P.M.	Need that occupy more than 3 days?

	Political importance of speedy passage of Housing Bill.





		2.	Monopolies : Report on Tyre Manufacture.



P.T.	Manufrs. are pressing me to suppress parts of report on tyres.

	Decided, after consultg. H.M. Amb., W’ton, that there is no reason of public interest to suppress any part of it.

	Wd. like to make this clear, in reply to P.Q. to-day because lobby is at work.



R.A.B. 	O.K. say there are 3 points of public interest.

	P.T. has a discretion.  I can’t say, on informn. available to me now, how it shd. be exercised.



P.T.	Have bn. considering this since June.  Am quite satisfied.  Lobbying with Ty. etc., follows my decision.



		Agreed :  Avoid answering to-day supplementaries on excision.

			    Ty. to consider at once wthr. they object to full publn.





		3.	Broadcasting (a) 14-day Rule.



H.C.	Opposn. have announced their view – debate (with free vote) followed by Select Cttee.  P.M. has taken line, in reply to P.Q., that this is not a matter for Sel. Cttee.

	We cd. have debate on motion proposing Sel. Cttee. – and free vote.



P.M.	A bit awkward for me if it were carried.		[Enter J.S.



H.C.	Good chance tht. it wdn’t be carried.



P.M.  	We can offer to find times for a debate.  Don’t delay it.



P.M.G.	Cdn’t debate be on motion approving principle, leaving procedure open.  That wd. involve 2 debates (one after report of Sel. Cttee.).



P.M.	I wd. prefer that.



	(b) Political Broadcasts.



H.C.	Oppn. now suggest one Welsh &amp; one Scottish political b’cast each year – to be arranged centrally, not by the Regional Councils.



J.S.	We must discuss with Opposn.; tho’ I am not keen.



		Agreed – discuss, with Opposition.





		4.	House of Lords :  Appointment of Joint Select Committees.



Sal.	Opposn. refused Joint Sel. Cttee. on Army &amp; Air Force Act.

	They are doing same on Naval Dis. Bill.

	V. wrong : for H/L. have more experience on this ques &amp; cd. contribute.

	This is a move to discredit H/L.  Shd. we stand firm.  Or shd. H/L. appoint Sel. Cttee. of their own.



H.C.	Oppn. object  i)  because tradition that Peer wd. be Chairman.

		         ii)  Proportional composn. wd. mean that Labour wd. be 		  outweighed.



Sal.	I offered to waive both those points on Army &amp; Air Force Cttees.



B.H.	And offer was repeated this time.  They object on principle.



Sal.	Then shall we appoint our own Cttee. – disadvantage of 2 Rpts.



		Agreed :  Press the point again with Opposition.



								[Exit Ch. Hill.

B.H.	

5.	Aswan High Dam.



R.A.B.	Seen E. For. Secy.  He has talked with Black.  Wants to go to W’ton.  Is willing to accept aid fr. U.S. Govt.  Consortium wd. accept co-opn. of a U.S. firm – Knudsen.

	Two diffies. remain :-

	i)  Black doesn’t want both medium &amp; long-term finance.  Doesn’t want Fr. &amp; G. Banks : wd. sooner do it all in U.S.  Ty. will persuade him out of that.

	ii) Dispute with E. &amp; Sudan on use of water.

	S. are being unreasonable on this.  Want F.O. co-opn. to seek understanding with S.

	Finance.  Hope of agreement now, so long as Bank don’t insist on internatl. tendering or on more than one U.S. firm.

	Next stage is discussion in W’ton, on instructions given.



R.	We don’t know what S. Govt. really intend.



P.M.	Get Helm’s view : see what he can do to help.





		6.	Togoland.



A.L.B.	We gave to U.N. impression tht. we shd. not be ready to go on administering Togoland after G. Coast became independent.

	U.N. commn. are there &amp; are about to propose a referendum which envisages continuing Trusteeship as alternative to merger in G. Coast.

x|	Want therefore to make it clear tht., if referendum went in favour of 

  |	Trusteeship, we wd. be ready to go on administering.  Alternative – another Trustee is intolerable.



H.	Wd. mean another H. Commn. territory in conflict with G. Coast – as in S. Africa.



A.L.B.	Even so, adminn. by e.g. Russia, wd. be even worse.



D.S.	Why didn’t we allow similar division, on basis of plebiscite, in Gold Coast?



A.L.B.	That is another issue.  But my mind is not closed.  We may have to re-open this v. big issue.



		Agreed as at x/.  Memo. on genl. ques to be submd.





		7.	A Capital for Wales.



Ll.G.	Now genl. agreement locally on Cardiff.

	Govt. depts. are there already – most of them.

	No formal act : merely recognition of it, in speech on behalf of Govt.



D.S.	Formal resolution by H/C. – to commit Opposn.?



Ll.G.	Prefer a simple statement.



		Agreed.





		8.	Pensions Increase Bill.



R.A.B.	Suggest this be appd. by next Cabinet – so that it may be announced on Thursday 17th.





		9.	Expenditure of Local Authorities.



R.A.B.	Some misunderstanding among l.e.a.’s.

	Have prepared draft P.Q. &amp; Answer.  Will agree it with M/Housing, M/Ed., &amp; S. of S. Scotland.
