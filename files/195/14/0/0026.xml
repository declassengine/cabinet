		1.	Parliament.					[Enter E.H.



R.A.B.	Tues/Wed. Defence debate.  Thurs. Army Estimates. Mon. F. Affairs.

	Mon. 5/3 or Tues. 6/3 2nd. Rdg. of Monopolies Bill.  Navy &amp; Air Estimates during week. 

	F. Affairs debate : S.Ll. and P.M.

	Defence debate : W.M. : M/Supply and S&amp;S Air on 2nd. day.  Ll.G. to intervene on 1st. day if needed on C. Defence.





		2.	N.Ireland Parliament : Disqualification.



Ll.G.	Two more members of N.I, Parlt. now found to be disqualified.  

	Have delayed presentn. of Wh. Paper, so that our announcement can cover all 6 cases.





		3.	Economic Situation.



P.M.	H.M. will make Party political b’cast on Saturday.

	The debate has gone v. well.  This shd. continue good presentation.

	I propose, with H.M. and I.M., to see T.U.C.  Waiting to see how they re-act.



I.M.	Have invited T.U.C. to suggest timing.  Date shd. be settled soon.

	Engineering wage claim.  Negotns. have bn. broken off; but I think this wd. have happened even if economic statement had not bn. made.



H.M.	Cd. the W.Paper be brought fwd. now?  



W.M. 	Yes : E.P.C. decided to-day that it shd. be brght up to date &amp; submd. to Cab. with view to early publn.





		4.	Imperial Institute.



P.M.	Thght. Cab. had decided we were going on with this project.  Hope we shan’t vacillate. 



D.S.	Scheduled as Grade 2 qua architectural interest.  Contributes to London’s skyline.  Pity we took the decision.  



B.H.	Unfortunate : but we have gone too far to change decision now.  There is no practical alternative.



R.A.B.	We are at loggerheads with F. Arts Commn.

	But design of new bldg shocks me.  Is there not time to review that, with F. Arts Commn. – makg. it clear that our decn. stands.



P.M.	That will re-open whole ques, surely.



D.S.	S.30 of T. &amp; C. Planning Act requires tht. my consent to demolition be obtained.



S.	Any reference to F.A. Commn. will involve delay.



H.M.	Cd. we inform them that decn. stands &amp; can’t be re-opened.  But, subject to no delay in bldg, ready to hear anything they may have to say about design of new bldg.



		Agreed  :  as proposed by H.M.



		5.	Egypt.



S.Ll.	Line to be taken with Nasser.  Must seek basis of co-existence or declare our hostility.  Can’t put up money for Aswan Dam while he continues open criticism of our policy in Jordan.  Try for a concordat.  If that fails, take up posn. of more openly declared hostility.



S.	What leverage have we got, assumg. tht. we can’t afford to let R. in on the Aswan Dam.



S.Ll.	Immediate object wd. be to stop E. propaganda.  For this, a jolt is needed.  Wd. try to make it plain to him tht. it is to our common advantage to co-exist.  Jolt cd. be Sudanese denial of water, viz., no Aswan Dam.



P.M.	We can run counter-propaganda from Iraq.



P.T.	Cd. we concert with U.S.  Wd. shock them if we played Sudan water card w’out consultn.



S.Ll.	No threat at this stage : merely strong talk that we must co-exist.





		6.	Capital Punishment.



Ll.G.	As in memo.

	Many amendments to Silverman’s Bill wd. be needed.



P.M.	Clear we can’t promote a Govt. Bill.

	Hope that, while Silverman’s Bill proceeds, there may be a revulsion of feeling v. abolition.



S.	H/Lds. wd. reject the Bill.  Gt. body of authve. legal opinion in favour of retn.

	Favour Ll.G.’s course – no Govt. Bill.

	Chorley’s Motion will indicate genl. attitude of H/L.

	If Silverman’s Bill were rejected by H/L., this wd. be a proper opportunity for H/L. function of delay.  A year’s delay might show more clearly how public opinion stands.



J.S.	As S.’s Bill will need extensive amendment, and as so many Labour ex-H.O. Ministers voted for abolition, might it be preferable that they shd. introduce a better Bill.



D.S.	Not if it’s our object to muck it up &amp; let it perish.



R.A.B.	S’s Bill is for 5 years’ suspension.  Do we say on 2nd. Rdg. that we intend to knock out Cl. 2(3)?  H/C. voted for complete abolition.



P.T.	What about Title?  Cdn’t amend that?



RAB.	We must promise facilities for a Bill on lines of that introduced by S : but we cd. say we must consider wtr it doesn’t need amendment.

	Opinion v. abolition is now becoming vocal.



P.M.	I will say that time will be given for 2nd. Rdg. of [a Bill on lines] Mr. S.’s Bill.							Agreed.



Ll.G.	Statement on Prerogative.  Propose, in lieu of last 2 lines, to use more general words used by Chuter Ede in ’48.			Agreed.



P.M.	Suggns. of referendum.  Propose to reply that this is impracticable &amp; wd. derogate from sovereignty of Parliament.		Agreed.





		7.	Technical Education.



D.E.	Our p’mme is not bad cpd. with U.S.  But it doesn’t compete with Soviet Union who, in 20 yrs, will be far ahead of the West.

	We must therefore do all we can – thro’ Universities and Colleges.

	Large reserve of talent : broad base of schools is what matters, in terms of what industry wants.  Must give opportunities at all stages &amp; levels. 

	Cd. Ty. give authy. to enable l.e.a.’s etc., to plan further ahead.  Wd. like to omit words in [  ] in para. 93 94 &amp; 95.

	Addn. shd. be made regarding needs of Colonies &amp; Comm. countries – para. 5.



H.	I agree on last point &amp; can suggest addns.



S.	Agree generally with intentns. of policy outlined in W. Paper.

	People who go to Univ. won’t go into engineering.  Those who go to T. College will.  Agree we must therefore rely largely on T. Colleges for engineers.

	Lord Cherwell’s view.  I have bn. led to view tht. special technolog. institutes wd. be a mistake.  Best teachers prefer University life.  Fr. angle of those taught, I wd. sooner not breed a class of people who have bn. educated without any contact with Arts.

	Prefer therefore to build up big techn. colleges in Ldn, Glasgow &amp; Manchr. &amp; allow them to develop – if they separate eventually from Universities, well and good.



H.M.	Support W. Paper in principle.

	Suggest we omit words in [  ] in para. 93 &amp; leave provisional in paras. 94 &amp; 95.

	Paras. 105 &amp; 106 : I must press for omission despite my private interest (!)



D.E.	Libraries need improvement.  They provide valuable service to industry.				Agreed : Paras. 105-106 to stand.



P.M.	Lack of balance because University side is so thin.  Cd. we not expand Ch. II. – saying why we have decided to build this part of our plan on existg. foundns. of Universities.



R.A.B.	Indicate what we have done.  Refer to next quinquennium as reason why we can’t say more now.  Don’t give reasons for our policy, for it is still subject of controversy in Universities.



P.M.	Expand it : put positive reason for our policy.		Agreed.



P.M.	Handling of further progress.  Cab. Cttee. with L.P.S. in Chair, to pull it all together.					(Parly. Secy. Scotland).



H.A.	No refce. in Paper to agricultural techn. educn.  Facilities are equal to  present needs : but will have to expand in future.  Suggest addl. para. in Ch. I.



K.	Botany &amp; zo-ology.  Research into grass &amp; pests.  Is that w’in scope of these proposals?



H.A.	Not sure.  Will consider it.					[Exit D.E.

									[Enter B.C.



8.	Legislative Programme.



R.A.B.	List of dropped Bills won’t cause many tears.

	Annex : I will defer Crown Lands : D.S.I.R. Bill cd. be introduced.  We must have legn. on Cap. Punishment.  We prob. ought to go on with Family Allowances.



P.T.	Accept p’ponement of Anti-Dumping Bill.



Ll.G.	We shd. start discussions on Re-distribution of Seats Bill.



S.	D.S.I.R. Bill.  A necessary measure.  Have appointed new Secretary.  Also a new Secretary of the Cttee.  Won’t be at all controversial.  A year’s delay wd. be v. disturbing.

	[I cd. start it in H/Lds.]



Ll.G.	Shops Bill?  



R.A.B.	No : 68 Clauses.



P.M.	We have dropped Gowers on Rlways.



A.L.B.	Caribbean Fedn.  A Bill will be needed.

	Colonial Development Corpn. : has bn. acting ultra vires and housing schemes are being held up.  

	Overseas Civil Service Re-organn.  A promise of legn. would help.



H.M.	Public Works Loans – will run out in July.  Legn. will be needed.

	Family Allowances – in Q. Speech.  Workmens’ Compn. wd. please T.U.C.



B.C.	Heavily committed to Family Allowances Bill.  V. short.  Cd. get 2nd. Rdg. on Fri. or ½ day.

	I wd. put that before W. Compensn.  Bill.



H.M.	I wd. not.  The latter is cheaper.



B.C.	F. Allowances is a counter-poise to Pensions Increase Bill.



R.A.B.	Believe it v. diff. to do F. Allowances this session because of economic climate as well as time-table.



		No decisions.  R.A.B. to talk to Ministers concerned.





9.	Widows Pensions.



B.C.	Not convinced that this is sound.  But we shall have trouble.  Hope we shan’t be forced to give way.



R.A.B.	V. awkward politically, esp. after bread and milk decision.



E.H.	Not so much diffy. among Govt. supporters as I had expected.



H.M.	Prefer to stand firm.  We will give to those in need.  But we will not give needlessly to these widows.

	I agree, however, that we shd. not cut off new cases.

	Do nothing.



		Agreed :	No increase in rate.

				No cut-off of new cases.

								[Exit B.C., E.H.

									[Enter H.W.

10.	British Transport Commission : Finances.		



H.W.	They are running a big deficit.  Asked Chairman what he proposes to do.  Delayed by i) wage increases  ii) superannn. on which he may have to be given directive.

	He has submd. plan for addl. revenue of £40 M.  Increase of 10%.

x|	in freight charges.  By using an unexploited margin from an old decision &amp; minor adjustments he can make up the £40 M. on passenger fares.

	This wd. result in deficit of £18 M. in this financial year.

	But I am looking for improvements thro’ greater efficiency – it won’t yield more than the £18 M.

x|	Wish to widen Ty. talks with B.T.C., fr. capital structure, to cover its accounting procedures etc.,

	My specific proposals are as at x/x/.



W.M.	Freight.  A flat 10% over all classifcns. of goods.



H.W.	10% is an average, some more and some less.  Will yield £26 M.

	Accumulated deficit is nearing £100 M.  Between £80 and £100 M.



H.M.	But turnover is £700 M.  This years’ deficit shd. be related to that.

	Freights.  Freedom to make differential rates to heavy users etc., subject to maximum charges.  A big &amp; ambitious scheme – coming in later.  For this financial year the 10% plan is interim measure.



P.T.	Consequences of a 10% increase when we are trying to stabilise prices.  Will increase industrial costs noticeably.



H.W.	£30 M. increases in wages bill during the year.



H.M.	Wd. like further opportunity to discuss after Minister has circulated a memo.



I.M.	Will be resentment in view of B.T.C.’s quick decision on wages.



		Agreed :         Submit memoranda on this &amp; on superannuation.





		11.	Malaya.



A.L.B.	Urgency – because of early mtg of Rulers.



W.M.	Satisfied with defence conclusions.



H.M.	Finance.  In interim period assistce. continues as at present.  If they show a need for it, we must meet it.

	After full self-govt., we must finance capital cost of expandg. internal defence forces &amp; deal with col. development.

	Satisf. scheme of compensn. has bn. settled for public services.



P.M.	A.L.B. has handled this with v. gt. skill.



H.	Will meet with satisf. response in other Comm. countries.



		Approved.





		12.	Cyprus.



A.L.B.	Big outstanding issue = amnesty.  Now agreemt can be reached on all constitutional issues.

	We have supported Govr’s view tht. we can’t announce amnesty until A’bishop has abjured violence and events have shown that violence will cease.

	But they now ask wtr amnesty cd. be made conditional on cessation of violence.  Govr. thinks this impracticable.



P.M.	We began with our formula &amp; A’bishop to abjure violence.  We have gone on to give him much detail on constitution.



H.M.	Irish Treaty was a treaty binding on both parties.  A’bishop has signed nothing.  Might consider amnesty if there were binding commitments.



A.L.B.	Will deal with this in a memo. for Cabinet.





		13.	Nuclear Tests.



W.M.	Will soon become known.  Practical reasons : dredger : advance parties going out in June.



P.M.	May arouse speculation or suspicion, maybe.  But does this matter.



H.M.	 People can know something is up – but not exactly what.



		Agreed :	No announcement yet : but Dpts. may

				take greater risk of leakage as necessary to

				avoid delay in preparatory actions.
