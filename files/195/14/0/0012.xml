C.M.39(55)							3rd November, 1955





		1.	Burgess and Maclean.				[Enter R., B.H.



H.C.	H.M.’s intentions.



P.M.	On F.O. – Eden/Bevin reforms.  No need for more. 

	Security – not for lawyers.  More for P. Councillors.



Ll.G.	Don’t need enquiry on Security : more a matter for Ministers because amendmt. of law wd. be involved.



D.S.	Wdn’t mind inter-Party Cttee. on security procedures : ex-Ministers.



H.C.	Shd. P.M. not discuss with C.R.A. before the debate.  See if he wd. agree to small body of P.C.’s who have held office to confer on security checks &amp; procedures in the public services.





		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Tues. Fin. Bill 2nd. Rdg.  Fin. Secy &amp; Econ. Secy., Ty.





		3.	House of Commons Disqualification Bill.



Ll.G.	Cl. 6. means disqualifn. of anyone who has controlling share-holding.

	Att.G. says it wd. affect some Govt. supporters.

	We have shown Bill to Oppn.  If we change Cl.6. they wd. know why.

	We wdn’t have any defence in H/C.

								[Exit B.C.

P.M.	It is right, surely?		

								[Enter J.S.

H.C.	Yes.							[Enter B.C.





		4.	Road Haulage Disposals Bill.



	a)	Transport Levy. 		Agreed.

	b)	Contract Hire Vehicles.



B.C.	R. Haul. Assocn. attitude makes it easier : they won’t object to intention by B.T.C.  This removes most of my political fears.  Reduces, rather than removes, my doubts.



A.L.B.	The holders of contracts will have had a change to transfer contracts to a private firm.



								[Exit B.C.

		5.	Egypt : Aswan Dam.



R.A.B.	U.S. Ty. &amp; Bank think E. figures are under-estimates.

	Unwise for us to under-write this w’out N. American help – Govt. or Bank.

	U.S. scheme : U.S. Govt. &amp; U.K. Govt. wd. put up $100 m, while Bank puts up $200 m.  Bank are v. interested.

	If we follow course (c), will it take too long &amp; let in Russians.

	As Bank are interested, don’t believe E. will rush ahead.

	I cd. put E. For. Minister against participn. of U.S. firms, not against participn. of Bank.

	Believe consortium will get the job.  Less need for hurry.

	Ask Makins &amp; H. to get best terms he can from Bank [&amp; U.S. Govt.]

	If it does mean internl. tender, see if U.S. Govt. will support us.



P.T.	Endorse general thesis.  But want to keep E. with us.  If we negotiate with U.S. Govt. behind their backs &amp; behind consortium E. may get cross.  Keep therefore to Bank (not U.S. Govt.) until we have talked to E. Foreign Minister.



P.M.	Risk by us + Bank is best course for us.

	Don’t want U.S. Govt. or Exp/Imp. Bank in it, if we can avoid it.  For that will lead in U.S. firms, wh. neither we nor E. wd. like.



H.C.	Hope we won’t do this alone, when we haven’t bn. able to do this sort of thing for Commonwealth countries.



R.A.B.	We may have to take bigger risk – to avoid R. engineers on head-waters of Nile.



P.M.	We must reserve our posn. on control of waters – influence in Sudan &amp; also our own E. African water.



D.S.	We can’t afford to lose this.



P.M.	We can’t under-write it all because of weakness of E. economy.  F.O. to consider wtr we shd. not now confer with G. Govt. on importce. of securing this for consortium.



Sal.	Support D.S.  P.M. &amp; R.A.B. shd. have authy. to do all necessary.



P.M.	Modern equivalent of Suez Canal shares.



	Approach Bank first : see what their condns. are : see what gap remains.



		But keep U.S. Govt. informed.





		6.	Full Employment : White Paper.



R.A.B.	Shall we publish a revised version?

	Wd. prefer to p’pone until end/Nov.

	Mayn’t do much good, but does make clear the diffies. of m’taining economy on full emplt. standard.



Sal.	What about Appendix?  



R.A.B. 	Omitted.  All amendmts. suggd. by Ministers have bn. incorporated.



P.M.	Circulate revised version.  Delay publn. for a while.





		7.	Colonial Immigrants.



Ll.G.	W. Indies : 20,000 this year &amp; rate is increasg.  Now 10 times what is was 2 years or so ago.  They are losing their most skilled.

	Here they are needed at present.  They are law-abiding.  But housing is a problem.  E.g. B’ham slum clearance : it is in those slums tht. Coloured are concentratg.

	750,000 Irish have come here since end/war.

	Immign. fr. India/Pakistan : 6.000/7.000 p.a., excludg. students.



H.C.	Govts. in I/Pak. are doing what they can to check this.



W.	We need the man-power.



D.S.	Control for housing proposed wd. be diff ; but we shd. try it.



A.L.B.	Bill, if we do it, must be non-discriminatory.  By sea alone 13.000 Austral., 9.000 Canadians, 5.000 N.Z. in 1954.  Ind/Pak. influx is greater than said.  And figures concern only arrivals by sea.  This wd. involve considerable interference with inter-Comm. movement.

	Election showed tht. this is not (yet) regarded as a v. serious social problem.  

	Shd. we not aim at spreading the load betwn. one area &amp; another.  This Bill wdn’t do that.  Once they complied with condns. and entered, they cd. concentrate into “black” areas.

	How wd. housing control work?  You can’t keep him to area first declared.

	Various diffies. about deportn.

	Gold-Coast/Nigeria.  Cdn’t treat them differently.

	Timing : don’t increase unemplt. in W. Indies just at moment when Fedn. is being negotiated.

	My view : Wait, + try to spread load here.



W.M.	No problem for me.  They are easily absorbed &amp; work well.  

	Control wd. turn on effectiveness of detailed provns. in O-in-C.

	Can’t control really w’out reporting to Police, as aliens, on change of address or change of job.

	Will have to admit tht. legn. is discriminatory.



Sal.	Not convinced by A.L.B.

	Doesn’t matter that public don’t ask for control now.  It may be our duty to act ahead, before it is too late.

	Flow of immigration is v. large.  Effect on racial characteristics of English people, in long run.

	Colonies restrict immigrn.  Why shd. we not do same?

	Why cdn’t we give figures – indicate dangers for future – any Govt. shd. have power to control.

	Admit diffy. re Irish : it wd. be illogical to exempt them.



P.T.	Factor of prosperity.

	Legn., if introduced, will be seen to be directed v. W. Indians.

	Will be regarded as illiberal measure.

	Wd. like to see the case for legn.



Sal.	Cd. you distinguish between temp. emplt. permit &amp; permanent residence.



		P.M. to consider means of further considn.
