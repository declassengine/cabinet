C.M.14(56)							15th February, 1956





		1.	Economic Situation.				[Enter E.H.



		Time-table.



H.M.	Will clear final text – phrasing – with Ministers concerned.  And full text to P.M. and L.P.S.

	Statement at 3.30 p.m. 16/2.  Business Statement having promised debate next week – preferably Mon &amp; Tues.

	Main reason : don’t want to delay raising Bank Rate for another week or to ask B/E. to hold “crisis” mtg otherwise than on Thursday.

	Our statement shd. follow soon after, so that it appears to be Govt. initiative, of which B/E. action forms part.

	Tell Speaker [&amp; Opposition] before noon – and Opposition v. soon thereafter.



R.A.B.	This will cause surprise and annoyance to Oppn. haste + crowding into c.p. debate.  Only national interest cd. excuse it.  Shd. have to suspend rule by ms. amendment – to give extra hour for c.p. debate.

	Debate – agree Mon. &amp; Tues.

	Alternative is for statement to be made at outset of debate on Mon.



P.M.	Danger of leakage of contents of “package” – esp. over week-end.



H.M.	Also feeling in City.

	And following a lead by B/E.  Also, fair warning to Oppn. for speeches.

	If you prefer, I cd. say on Thurs. tht. B/E. action is part of our plan &amp; promise statement on Friday.



I.M.	Frid. wd. be better than Thurs. fr. angle of wage negotiations.



	Investment Allowances.



H.M.	Propose to give notice now that in Finance Bill there will be alterations in investment allowances – terminating the system retrospectively as from 17/2.  The initial allowances wd. stand unaltered.



P.M.	Wd. prefer to use word “suspend”.



H.M.	This accords with general theme of our plan.



RAB.	Introduced in Budget ’54 – quoted arguments used – less cap. investment here than in U.S. or even in Germany.  I refused then to accept Revenue view that this was a subsidy &amp; hope it won’t be so described.

	This was something our Govt. introduced.  I wd. have preferred suspension of initial allowances, which has bn. subject to variation by successive Govts.  The other was an enlightened scheme, which I am sorry to see suspended.

	Admit however, that this is a logical &amp; rational feature of a disinflationary plan.



H.M.	Will stress the idea of a Keynesian suspension in the debate.  In statement shall have to avoid ambiguity.



P.T.	Agree it wd. be better not to describe them as subsidies.



RAB.	Criticisms : T.U.’s : agricultural bldgs : shipping.



H.M.	I can exempt shipping already in construction.  And concession will apply to projects already started &amp; that will help agricultural bldgs.

	Will consider wtr shipping can be wholly exempted.



	Food Subsidies.



S.Ll.	Hope we cd. have avoided mention of milk price increase, not due until July.  What effect will it have on current wage claims?



A.L.B.	Yes : need we put c/living index up by more than 1 point.



H.M.	Statement w’out it isn’t enough on real savings.  Estimates up by £100M.  Capital cuts are redns. in p’mmes.  This is a real figure.

	Milk doesn’t have same effect on labour claims.  We put it up last year.

	Oppn. will demand import cuts.  If I don’t say firmly “No”, there will be forestalling.  Yet I believe we may have to do it.  Same dilemma as faced R.S.C. in denying intention to devalue.



A.L.B.	On milk, I wd. sooner rely on “progressive reduction”. 

									[Exit S.Ll.



H.M.	I still think it wd. be right to promise complete removal of these subsidies.  I can’t reduce its effect still further.



R.A.B.	Thought last night you were willing to omit reference to milk.



	Timetable.



P.T.	V. diff. to synchronise my H.P. Order with statement on Fri.  Because of re-printing &amp; mtg. of Council on same day as Queen returns.

								[Exit D.S.



	Meeting with T.U.C. &amp; Employers.



I.M.	Wait until after debate.  May be better.  Awkward to see them on Friday.

	Arrange mtg. for Wed.				Agreed.
