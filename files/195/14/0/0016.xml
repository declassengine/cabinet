C.M.6(56)							24th February, 1956





		1.	Parliament.		[Enter E.H., Ch. H., B-C., Turton, A.J., 						 H.W



R.A.B.	Statements after P.Q.’s.  Numerous.  Propose to send round guidance on this – to reduce quantity – space them out. – reduce length.

	H/Commons Disqualification.  Discussed in Leg. Cttee.  Bill will be needed for Beatty.





		2.	Economic Situation.



H.M.	Our diffies. are well known.  Indices : employment higher than in ’54 : many more unfilled vacancies.  Even if we tried to increase exp’re : we cdn’t do so.  Trade returns : £50 M. deficit Oct., rising to £73 M. in Dec.  Due to demands of industry.  Reserves : from £780 in June ’54 have fallen to £757M.

	Remedies.  Large measure of agreement.

	If we don’t act now, we shd. appear to be producg. Estimates for ’56/57 £228 M. higher than those for ’55/56., &amp; even higher than out-turn.  Due to inflation because money is losing value : have therefore to run v. fast in order to keep up.

	Memo. is partial because doesn’t cover monetary policy in detail.  Tho’ action e.g. on Bank Rate shd. not be taken save in conjunction with other measures over a wide field.  Also – omits any balancing action which might be taken in Budget.

	Timing.  Can’t wait until Budget (12 or 18 Apl.) Jan. trade figures, if bad, might provoke a run on sterling.  Tho’ some measures shd. not be taken while wage negotns. are procdg.  Aim to submit final p’mme after P.M.’s return on 9/2 with view to statement in H/C. on 15/2 or thereabouts when Vote on Account is published.  For that will show increased Estimates.



P.M.	Defence.  Metal-using industries.  We made a thoro’ review in Def. Cttee.  But clear now that we shan’t be able to spend Estimates esp. on Aircraft &amp; R &amp; D.  W.M. asked to look into this further.  May have to discard some projects because we can’t do them.  That will give us financial saving.  Make more allowance for under-spending – takg. supplementaries if need be.  Also may be better to cut some provision for global war prepns. by Services instead of defence exp’re by civil Dpts.



R.A.B.	Credit Policy.  Can we intensify the squeeze?



H.M.	Weaknesses :	i)  mainly investment boom.  Lower dividends since war has left firms with large liquid reserves.

			ii) natd. industries have not needed to go to public.

	If we make a contn. now on (ii), we shall get firmer action by Banks.



R.A.B.	Think we shd. be firm with Banks.  They don’t take enough a/c of what Govt. have done already.



P.T.	Hire Purchase.  Am ready to go further.  Tho’ produces more political clatter than economic effect.  Will discuss how far we can go.



R.A.B.	Trouble in H/C. over furniture.		Agreed in principle.



H.M.	Savings.  Must be sure of retaining support of Movement.  It may have to be no more than acceptance of action by Govt., rather than action thro’ Movement.



D.E.	Insurance cos. also tap small savers, tho’ life insurance not liable to tax.  Cd. the cos. introduce some new &amp; attractive scheme.



H.M.	Am consultg. Prudential.



		Investment.



H.W.	Railways.  At outset of big p’mme.  “Defer until next year” involves absolute cut, doesn’t it?



H.M.	Presentn.  Approve useful schemes, but re-phase them.  Spread them out over longer period.  Large estimates for this wd. prob. be under-spent this year because of shortage of resources.



H.W.	I cd. help in tht. way.  Diff. to handle one year at a time.  Will 

suggest to H.M. means of spreading over 2/3 years.  	Agreed.

	Have already put para. 16 to B.T.C. &amp; can meet H.M. on this.



A.J.	Coal, Electricity &amp; Gas.



	Can do all H.M. asks &amp; even more on gas.

	But on coal I can’t go all the way.  £110 M. is actual figure : I cd. cut it by £5 M. but beyond that I shd. cut into production.  Can’t m’tain labour force unless you show intention to expand investment.

	Lack of balance : investment in some indies. ahead of others.  And coal has fallen behind.  Can’t afford to cut it back further.

	Subject to that, will yield total economy desired by H.M. over group as a whole.							Agreed.



P.M.	Imports.



A.J.	P’ponement to summer : not cancellation.



P.M.	E.P. Cttee. shd. look at this in reln. to stocks etc.,  		Agreed.



Ll.G.	Wd. they have spent so much under private ownership?  How much invested since war in modernisation of mines?



A.J.	About £400 M.



Ll.G.	V. large investment for small apparent result.



A.J.	Don’t accept that : will circulate memo.



H.A.	Regret delay in rural electrification.  Avoid sharp reduction.



A.J.	Citrine may insist on directive on this.



J.S.	Scottish Electricity.  Already reduced distn. exp’re from £8.2 M. to £8.  Will also try to reduce exp’re on production.  But in future years it shd be a bigger coal-saver.



H.W.	Civil Aviation.  Airport constn. shd. come into account.  Will make a joint proposn. to H.M. covering that as well as Corpn.



R.T.	Hospitals.  We are pledged not to cut this p’mme.  P.M. 17/10.  Breach of that wd. do us more harm that money saved. Most I cd. cut wd be .4.

	Guillebaudreport will be publd. tomorrow.  It finds no extravagance &amp; o means of saving.  On cap. exp’re. it finds we are spending only ⅓rd. of pre-war.  Propn. spent on hospital bldg. has declined by 40% over last 4 years.  It recommends return to pre-war rate when present p’mme runs out in 1957/8 – annual exp’re at £30 M.

	Shocked by condns. in some old hospitals.  Most of £17½ M. p’mme is really slum clearance.  Mental &amp; m.d. hospitals are even worse.



H.M.	Hope Minister will evade any new commitment or repetition of old pledges in his f’coming statement in H/C.

	Can’t afford exemptions from this attack “across the board”.



R.A.B.	Small p’mme : strong case for exceptional treatment.



H.M.	At least no new commitment.



P.M.	Can’t accept Gillebaud aim to go to £30 M. after 57/58.



H.M.	This p’mme was v. late in starting.



P.M.	Not inclined to cut existg. p’mme, to which we are pledged.



J.S.	Support P.M.  This is exceptional.



P.M.	Easier to avoid £30 M. if we stand on existg. p’mme.



H.M.	Reluctantly agreed.



W.M.	Atomic Energy.  Will involve re-examining 6 new reactors.



R.A.B.	Plowden is reviewing p’mme.  Think we can help.

	May not involve any public appearance of slowing down.



H.M.	Saving might be secured thro’ avoiding double-time for Sundays.



S.Ll.	Look for savings mainly on defence side e.g. no. of bombs.



Ch.H.	Post Office.  £92.5 M. this year and £97.5 M. next.  Shall under-spend this year, but shall need more next.  Can work to £182 M in 2 years, assuming defence cut of £2½ M.  If that were £4 M. my figures wd. be correspondingly less.



P.M.	P’pone new starts of P.O. bldg.



Ch.H.	Accept principle tht. no increase in exp’re next year as cpd. with this.



P.T.	Development Areas : Factories.  Estimates Cttee. have reported that we have spent too much.  We can take shelter under that.  But it means p’poning diversification, wh. goes to long-term unemployment problem.

	Can accept H.M.’s proposal in principle.



J.S.	Can’t clamp down completely e.g. in Lanarkshire when Chandos is going ahead in N. Ireland.

	Must be some exceptions.  



H.M. 	Admit that.



B.H.	Government Building.  Much redn. already in large bldgs.  Will do all I can to help.  Am discussing with Ty.



R.A.B.	New Towns.  Can we not add this, as new item?  And secure saving.



D.S.	Factories are being erected only to balance houses.

	Doubt if there is much we can do.



P.T.	Wd. help us to defend cuts in Developmt. Areas, factory bldg.



	Home Defence : Civil Depts expenditure.



H.M.	Def. Cttee. agreed that training etc.,  shd. continue – at £28 M.

	But is this the moment to increase stock-piles.

	We have spent about £300 M. on this since war ended.



Ll.G.	Cd. accept cut in fire-fighting.

	But not cut in Observer Corps &amp; radar chain.  W’in the .45 M. figure.



P.M.	This shd. be related to active defence prepns. which contain still a large element for prepns. for global war.  Diff. to defend this cut in (home) civil w’out corresp . cut in action for global war.



W.M.	Caveat on saving suggd. in communications.



Ch.H.	50% cut in telephones to airfields : air raid warning system : slowing down of ring-circuit trunks.  Wd. involve some compensn. paymts.



W.M.	Shd. wish to examine this with H.D. Cttee.  Also to consider balance between civil &amp; active.



H.A.	Food stocks we have wd. provide no safeguard v. mass starvation.  Hope I can have some provn. for food-packs.



P.M.	U.S. storing here.  May I have discretion to go for what they

Brief for  |	are willing to send e.g. canned meat – instead of diff. propn. of

W’ton      |	wheat wh. wd. have to be destroyed at intervals.  Avoiding heavy exp’re on storage.



D.S.	Local Authority Investment.  Must accept somethg. on these lines.  But l.a.’s are in awkward mood &amp; will howl.  Shd. like therefore to be assured tht. redns. will be spread over whole of l.a. services.  No mention here of H.O. bldg. (police etc.,) minor roads, allotments etc., – variety of small services.

	Water and sewerage. Will be great outcry, esp. fr. rural areas.

	Holdg. it at £38 M. means cutting back from £60 M. to which it rose in current year.

	Want discretion to make exceptions in urgent cases e.g. epidemics.



J.S.	No immediate results if work in progress is to continue.



R.A.B.	Look at statement in Election manifesto on water &amp; sewerage.  At least for presentation.



	Housing.



R.A.B.	I wd. be ready to go further – reducing. Total £600 M.



D.S.	Unless you re-introduce allocations, only method wd. be to reduce subsidy still further.  Later, it may become possible to w’draw the £10 subsidy.

	Para. 33.  Suggn. of cutting existing subsidy wd. be v. revolutionary.  Cdn’t face that unless inflation became v. much more serious.

       *	Rent Restriction.  Welcome Ministerial Cttee.



	Education.



D.E.	Can’t offer economy on “further education” because inconsistent with proposed expansion of technical education.

	But may be able to make larger saving on Training &amp; Minor Projects.

	P’ponement will fall mainly on primary &amp; secondary schools.  If we stopped rural re-organn., it wd. damage secondary educn. which is vital to prodn. of technologists. 

	P’mme is lagging, however : and £10 M. or more can be cut fr. this years’ authd. p’mme.  This can be pushed forward.

	But this, like G.P.O. means m’taining existg. rate of bldg.  Is it good enough, qua inflation.  If not, all I can do is to impose moratorium on approvals for x weeks.  Shd. like to say to l.a.’s no more approvals of school projects until ¼ next. (after date of general announcement).  Wd. prefer to present it as step to increase efficiency of bldg.  Doubt if I can do this unless other Ministers adopted moratorium procedure.  Otherwise cut will become effective only at end of 1956/57



H.M.	Support principle of moratorium., over 50% of building which we do control.



J.S.	I will discuss wth Ty. means of conforming.



	Roads.



H.W.	Want to change emphasis – small improvemts vice large projects.

	Will drop the £6 M.  But do the above manoeuvre.

	Will put alternative plan to Ty., over 2 or 3 years.

	Can suspend all m’tenanance work for the time.



	Factory Building.



P.T.	General announcement may make factory-owners’ change intentions.



B.H.	Building licensing.  Legn. wd. be needed.  And an odious measure.  Not sure, even so, that control wd. work.  Time lag before materials etc., began to be used.  Also forestalling.  To avoid time lag, limit wd. have to come much lower.  	That wd. mean more staff etc., 

	Building industry responds v. slowly to control.

	Surely we can hope that credit squeeze will have its effect.



H.M.	I’m against this.  But it means we must operate our [own] control over own bldg &amp; credit squeeze more stringently.



B.H.	Industry reports that pressure is relaxing.



P.M.	Accept this position – but I find it v. worrying.



	Defence.



P.M.	Reserve this – for W.M.’s review and my discussion (e.g. a Divn) in Washington.

          *	Report to P.M. wtr a Divn. from Germany cd. be deployed in U.K. – accommodation.

			Discussion adjourned until 6.30 p.m.
