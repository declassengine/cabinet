RAB.	A.B. will ask, this p.m., wtr joint Parly. Delegn. shd. go to Cyprus.  Awkward because this was successfully done in Kenya.

	Propose to give temporising reply, promisg to consider with other Ministers.



Ll.G.	Effect on Police of statements that all will be well when Labour comes in.

		3.	Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill.



R.A.B.	We will go quietly on first day, and report to Cab. next Thursday.



P.M.	Hope Ll.G. won’t give specific advice to H/C.



Ll.G.	Will avoid that – tho’ wish to indicate my approval of need to protect police &amp; prison warders.



R.A.B.	Avoid diffy. wh. wd. arise if defeated after giving def. advice.

P.M.	Yes – put it that way.





5.	Singapore.



A.L.B.	Formula re internal security.  Local authies. in S. accept in principle.  Views of Commrs. are in transit.

P.M.	Avoid definite commitment.

					[Exit C., Carrington., C.I.G.S., A.H.

7.	Smoking and Lung Cancer.			[Enter R.T.



R.T.	Advice of Med. Adv. Cttee. – tht. I shd. constantly inform public of facts.

	Facts – as in memo.  Statistical picture is clear : scientific no progress.

	Draft statement is restrained.

	Won’t satisfy all.  Will be much criticism.  Pressure for a warning campaign.  Don’t advise this because of lack of scientific “proof”.



P.M.	Doesn’t give Govt. view.  Shall be pressed for a view.  Time is arrived when we shd. decide wtr we have a line.

	Public opinion will now expect more than a progress report.



S.	M.R. Council : repns. askg. for considered assessment.  Wd. be diff. to resist that pressure, if Govt. fail to give a line.  Para. 4 will be regarded as unduly cautious in some quarters.



H.M.	V. serious issue.  Revenue = 3/6d. on income tax : not easy to see how to replace it.

	Expectation of life 73 for smoker &amp; 74 for non-smoker.  Ty. think revenue interest outweighs this.  Negligible compared with risk of crossing a street.



S.	Necessary to expose facts?



H.M.	But in reln. to other facts?



J.S.	M’while quote medical views, not Govt. views.



R.A.B.	Report (Doll &amp; Hill) in June – may show this statement as not sufficiently grave.  Wise therefore to take more time to consider.



		Agreed :  Cab. Cttee. to enquire.  L.P.S., L.P., H.M., R.T., J.S.
