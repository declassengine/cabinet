C.M.21(56)							9th March, 1956





		1.	Jordan.				[Enter E.H., A.N. Kirkbride



A.K.

CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000





S.	Rpt. tht. E. will offer to pay [our] subsidy to J.  How wd. J. re-act?  We can’t have a series of humiliations.



A.K.	J. knows what lies behind offer of subsidy fr. Arab States.  They mght pay for 1 or 2 yrs. : J wd. break with U.K. : subsidy wd. then cease : J. wd. be absorbed.

	J. mght try to take money fr. both sides.  But wdn’t break with us for sake of Arab subsidy.



P.M.	Tel. 84 this a.m. fr. Syria – reportg. Press articles suggestg. what provinces of J. shd. be taken over by E. &amp; Syria on break-up.  That shd alarm J.

	No one is gripping situation in J.

	Supposg. we offer a mil. mission &amp; legion stays at level of Iraq Army, will King be able to hold position?



A.K.	At least a 50/50 chance.  We must try.  They don’t want to cease to be independent.  Action v. Glubb : symptom of this desire : dislike of having foreigner i/c their Army. 

Demonstrations in Amman were not really anti British.  No interference with Br. community.  I actually received ovation.  

King’s posn. is v. strong.  E. cd. not easily get him removed.



R.A.B.	Cd. we negotiate a re-adjustment of our liability under Treaty?  Oblign. was based on our view of reliability of Legion.  If it’s to be less strong, our oblign. must be less extensive.



P.M.	Treaty obligns. were reduced in 1950.  They are now little more than those under Tripartite Decln.  J. and we have read into it, &amp; mil. agreemt., more than there is in black &amp; white.

	F.O. shd. produce a note showg. what greater oblign. rests on us under Treaty than under Decln., if any.



H.M.	1)  Some extra flavour of oblign. derived fr. fact tht. Br. officer was in command.  2) Lower efficiency of Legion makes it less likely tht. it wd. make aggressive move against Israel.



R.A.B.	Tho’ with Arab offrs. they may be more rash.



D.S.	Are there any concessions which we mght obtain in return – as J. are worried about consequences of their action in dismissing Glubb.



A.K.	Talks beginning with posn. of Br. offrs. are bound to broaden out into discn. of future relations – wh. will give opportunity for all such points to be considered.



S.	Timing.  At what moment shd. we open negotns.  Hope there will be talks betwn. Kings of I. and J.  Shd. we wait until after those.



A.K.	Start talks at once, thro’ Amb., w’out sending anyone there.  And start fr. officers’ posn. – w’out offering to go into wider ques.



								[Exit Kirkbride.

[   ..   E.H.

		2.	Farm Price Review.				



H.A.	Informed N.F.U.’s of our decision.  They have now submd. proposals totalling £25¼ M. [+ 2 unacceptable condns.]  Evidently, they will go long way to get agreed settlement.  My view is now tht. we shd. try for agreemt. at £25¼ M., but with a diff. make-up of items.  Dislike ¾d. on milk and 30/= calf subsidy.  I wdn’t go beyond  ⅝d. on milk.



H.M.	Not sure we shan’t be said to have paid too much.  On merits £15 M. wd. prob. have bn. right.  I wd. sooner have imposed settlement – even at £25 M.  V. diff. for them to make effective criticism of settlement at £24 M. when known they wd. have accepted £25¼ M.

	Alternatives : stand on £24 M.  Or make it £25 M., but makg. the addn. by somethg. justifiable on purely economic grounds.  I wdn’t give a further increase on milk.  Cd. add a bit on silage.



A.L.B.	Nationally better to impose £24 M.  Not so sure of feeling in Party.



D.S.	Favour imposed settlement.



R.A.B.	Prefer agreement – £25 M. composed as H.M. prefers.



I.M.	Stand firm.  Remember wage claim.  Workers are seekg. interview with Minister because claim rejected.  Settlemt. at £24 M. wd. be v. helpful in wages field, esp. agric. wages – fr. which cycle normally starts.



H.M.	Turner has responded to firmness.  Don’t want to weaken now.



H.A.	Have achieved that object by bringing him down fr. £41 M. to £25.



J.S.	Only sensible course is to offer to work out with them a scheme for silage.  Not more than £1 M. 				      [Re-enter E.H.



R.A.B.	Rejection of £25 M. wd. sour relations with Turner &amp; N.F.U.’s.



H.M.	If we give another £1 M., it must not be on milk, pigs or eggs.



		? Inform him : [no advance on milk], eggs or pigs : has he

		Agreed.  [  ].			anything further to say?





		1.	(Cont’d) Jordan.



		Draft telegrams considered.



S.	There shd. also be message of guidance to Amb. – what he is to say about wider issues if raised.



H.	Limit this to mil. mission.  Can’t have Arab offrs. later seekg. to exclude Br. offrs. fr. Legion itself.



A.N.	Our aim was to get J. Govt. to accept continuing oblign. to Br. offrs.  Point 4 in “suggns”.



P.T.	Send off message to King.  Delay message to For. Minister until we have seen instns. to Amb



Agreed :	message to King &amp; For. Minister to go, subject to amendment, &amp; F.O. to send covering instructns. to Ambassador.





3.	Israel.



A.N.	S.Ll. proposes to make formal call on Sharrett in Tel Aviv and formal call on Ben Gurion in Jerusalem viz., equal in both cities.

	Israeli’s say first is impracticable.  Evidently trying to drive in a wedge.

	If we are to resist this, S.Ll. can say to Sharett he will go to Tel Aviv only.  Israelis mght then cancel whole visit.

	Alternative, do as they ask but issue statement afterwds. tht. it doesn’t affect our recognition policy.  But in that event we wd. have to get I. to agree in advance tht. they wdn’t issue contradictory statement.

	First course wd. be better.  Is it politically possible?



D.S.	I. evidently mean to exploit this – as a further step.



S.		Do what Dulles did : no more.  Doubt if they wd. cancel visit.

	x|	Start with that.  If I. reject that, say he can go to Tel Aviv – only.



		Agreed – as at x/.
