C.M.28(55)							15th August, 1955





		1.	I.R.A. Raids on Army Barracks		[Enter H.H.



P.M.	Will discuss with S of S. for War &amp; Home Secy.

	Aim : to do somethg. effective w’out appearing dramatic.





		2.	Economic Affairs.



R.A.B.		i)  Shortage, man-power, causes inflationary pressure.

ii) Can’t expect Banks to operate credit restns. w’out Govt. doing same.  Must ask that we prosecute this vigorously. Will discuss specific proposals later Cab.

	Sterling.  Some uneasiness.

	Wish to have Cab. discn. on this before I leave for Turkey.



W.	Govt. must show v. gt. strength if country is to be carried with us.  This involves delaying much that we shd. like to do – in order to check inflation.  If we are half-hearted in this, creeping inflation thro’ rising wages will price us out of markets.



W.M.	4 m. (2m. in engineering &amp; shipbldg.) are about to lodge wage claims.  Tho’ order books of shipbldg. industry have lengthened.

	No prospect of c/living coming down.

	Rlways : road passenger transport : miners (redn. of hours) : newspp.

	Indications therefore of a troublesome autumn.



R.A.B.	I intend to achieve what W. proposes.  Welcomed his memo.  Will submit concrete plans at next mtg. – in about 10 days time.



W.	We must carry public with us on this.



Sal.	Danger of policy of restrictg. investment needed for modernising our capacity to compete.  E.g. roads : usually can’t build them because times are too bad : are we now to be precluded because times are too good?  	Same applies to modernising production plants.



		Agreed :  Meet for this on Aug. 26th. (Fri.) subject to x/.



H.A.	Overt signs now of inflation.  Work going even more slowly.

	Credit restns. appln. to farmers may be damaging – not enough animals to eat the available grass.



D.E.	Confidence factor working : wise to leave it as long as 26/8.



P.M.           x/	Leave it to me to put it forward to 22/8 or 23/8, if need be.   /x





		3.	Singapore.



		(a)	Constitution.



H.H.	Phase i)   Apptmt. of Ministers.  Local support for Govr’s refusal.

	         ii)   Marshal’s argument re oblign. to accept his advice.

	        iii)   Legve. Assembly’s demand for self-government.

	Choice now : keep this Govt. in office or risk consequences of direct rule.

	Concessions wh. ALB now proposes to make do not undermine any essential interest of U.K.  He must stand firm on Dissolution : tho’ on prorogation he cd. make concession provided Govr. retains reserve power.

	Method.  Can’t do it by “liberal interpn.”  Marshal’s objns. to amendmt. of constitn.  Propose therefore method of formal dirn. to Govr. 

	Talks in Ldn. on constitn. next year is more difficult.  Their requests (larger Assembly : M/Justice) are not, in themselves, dangerous.  Undesirable however to re-open it all so soon : tho’ we have had to do so elsewhere.  But Singapore &amp; Malaya are last 2 important Colonies to get this degree of independence.  Also last 2 outposts of 

                 y|	“Colonialism” in S.E.A.  : don’t want to risk b’down there.



W.M.	On apptmt. of Ministers, Govr. &amp; S of S. both want to make concession.

	On Prorogation &amp; Dissolution, concession is contemplated only in last resort on prorogation.

	On method : “liberal interpn.” is plainly unacceptable.  Art 7 of  O-in-C. contemplates instns. to Govr. on discharge of duties of his Office.  This, Att G., claims, is in effect to amend constitn.  But I hold that it is w’in power of S of S. to proceed in that way, in advance of amendmt. of constitn.

	Anyhow, it can’t be challenged.  Nor wd. it constitute any awkward precedent.



R.A.B.	Ready to accept proposals in memo.  	Clear that no concession shd. be made on Dissolution.  Must we make concession on Prorogation?

	

Sal.	Ch. Minister might refuse to prorogue.  But, if Govr. has right to dissolve, he can overcome that.



H.H.	Yes : there wd. also be a safeguard on prorogation.



P.M.	I don’t accept y/.  I had no diffy. at Bankok in establishg. that Malaya &amp; Singapore are best governed countries in S.E.A.  The other countries have never had an election.  They are also much more prosperous.  Don’t be deterred by that consn.



		Agreed :	Authorise concessions on Ministers.

				         ..                 ..       on prorogation, with 

				safeguards, as last resort.

				No concession on dissolution.



	But I am against promising review of constitn. next April.  Wd. suggest we are on the run.  Offer to “meet Marshall next April to discuss general situation.”



H.H.	A.L.B. proposes to suggest discns. with Malaya re relations with U.K. Wd. suit us to have such discns. with Singapore.  But those discns. wd. involve some revision of constitn.  E.g. a specific defence agreement.



P.M.	Can’t accept para. 11(e) – especially with the reference to “timing”.



S.H.	Be adamant on defence, for. relns. and internal security, but allow them to set their own pace on other constitutional “advance”.



P.M.	  |	“ … to discuss the situation of the Colony in the light of a years’ 

z|	working of the constitution.”  He cd. say that.

	Making it clear that we will not relinquish control over internal security.



Sal.	Can say that the talks will be comprehensive.



S.Ll.	More apprehensive of that because it mght thght to cover reserved ques.



		Agreed as at z/.



		(b)	Re-inforcement.



S.Ll.	A brigade in U.K. strategic reserve is earmarked for this.

	But suggest one battn. shd. come from H. Kong.

	By Oct., we shd. have another available from Kenya or fr. Canal Zone.

	The battn. from H. Kong might go to Singapore, vice Malaya.



H.H.	We shd. not wish to see any weakening of H. Kong garrison.



S.Ll.	A field regt. might be available from Korea : dependent on consultns. with U.S.



P.M.	Dislike weakening H. Kong.  Tougher you look, quieter you will be.



S.Ll.	We have 11 units there : shd. be removing only one.



R.A.B.}	Support H. Kong proposal, subject to warning Govr. now that this

H.M.   }	may be done as emergency arrangement.



		Agreed  :  M/D. and C.O. to discuss on this basis.



							[Exit H.H.





		4.	Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.



P.M.	Jan. is a good month for this.  Useful to have it before the Russian visit.  Shd. we warn them now.



H.	Autumn wd. be better qua Gold Coast.



R.A.B.	Wd. welcome opportunity to discuss economic situation.



H.M.	Cd. base it on R. visit.  For. Ministers Mtg. over.



Sal.	This is a special year.



		Agreed.





		5.	Russian Visit to U.K.



P.M.	Reported exchange of messages with Bulganin.



H.M.	Care to avoid over sympathetic demonstrations by Br. public.

	E.g. football matches.  I wd. prefer to make it rather more formal.

	Queen  :  a luncheon?



P.M.	Luncheon at Windsor wd. be v. appropriate.



								[Enter B.C.



		6.	Road Haulage Disposals.



B.C.	900 more vehicles to be retained than we had assumed.



Sal.	Must be guided by expert advice on numbers necessary, once we have decided the principle.



W.	Why announce it?



B.C.	I told Parlt. we were seeking EVC’s advice.  Purchasers must know how many are available.



W.	Normally, Minister takes responsibility.



P.M.	Announce with minimum publicity.





		7.	Mid. Ulster Bye Election.



P.M.	Unsatisf. result.



		Agreed  : Next mtg.  W. to obtain advice m’while.



							[Enter Boyle, Low.



		8.	Japan : Trade &amp; Payments.



P.M.	Can’t we try another round before we insist.



Low.	Our advice : no chance on discrimination v. sterling.



Boyle.	Want to try once more to get assurances, if we don’t restrict Col. purchases.



P.M.	What faith cd. we put in such assurances.  Outcry here if more J. goods flow into Colonies.



L.	Add another £7 M. to a £5 M. wh. is hard enough already.



S.Ll.	Why is shipping excluded.



P.M.	Cd. we not p’pone this until next Cabinet.  Our delegn. cd. be instructed by telegram after their return to Japan.



H.A.	Support B/T. line.



W.	We must be firm with Japan.



		Agreed  :	P’pone until next Cab.

				M’while get report on shipping ques. (F.O.)  			Shd. it not be brought in?  	           [Enter H.H.



D.E.	We have no cards to play nowadays because what they want is materials from Doms., little from U.K.





		9.	Irish Republic : German Industries.			[Exit B.C.



P.M.	Disliked Norton’s remarks.



Low.	So did I.  But policy no difft. fr. other sterling area countries.



S.M.	But 90% if Ireland’s product comes to U.K.  So we shd. be in a strong posn. to be tough with them if we wished.



W.	And they must sell it here.



Low.	Agric. exports to U.K. is only ⅓rd. of total exports.



P.M.	Give warning to Irish thro’ dipl. channels.



H.	Nothing will happen in fact.  Watch it, via Clutterbuck.	Agreed.





		10.	Cyprus.



H.M.		i)   Shall we cancel Conference – because of Gk. radio excesses.

	Is it to our advantage to [refuse to warn them we won’t] sit down with people who incite to murder?

		ii)  How compose the Conference, if held?  Repves. of Cyprus?

		Archbishop will prob. come to Ldn.

	Suggest we say : this is a conference of Govts. : but we wd. be ready to consider written statements by Archbishop and Mufti. 

(iii)  Tactics.  Will spin it out.  Opening statements, with translation, might last until Thursday.  Then I wd. suggest drafting Cttee. to draw up specific statements of various points of view.  These may be less uncompromising or wild.

	[Opening statements might be published.  Thereafter, procdgs. in diplomatic privacy.]  This may produce a deadlock.  But we shall have shown it’s a deadlock, not because of Br. Colonialism, but because of differences between Greece &amp; Turkey.  Then Br. plan cd. be produced.  Its nature wd. turn on wtr we then see that there is, or is not, hope of securing its acceptance.  There will be chance for Cab. to consider that before it’s tabled.



P.M.	Indicate in opening speech that we have some ideas, tho’ this is not moment to produce them.

	On (i) I think we must go on with the Conference.



H.M.	We shd. be ready to get firm internal control over Island.



H.H.	Proposal for Director of Operations (military).  Difficult.



P.M.	Wd. prefer a policeman, not a soldier.



A.H.	Chief of Police is good.



		Agreed :  Cyprus Cttee. to meet &amp; submit proposals.



H.H.	Govr. is going to b’cast on new legn.





		11.	Disarmament.



P.M.	i)   Para 5.  I did discuss with Gruenther in Geneva.  Cd. we not carry it on with him before Nutting leaves?



H.M.	He only has 2 wks in N.York.



S.Ll.	If you ask G. formally, he will want to refer to N.A. Council.



P.M.	V. well.  But let him develop it a little more.

ii)  Para 5.  U.S. no firm views.  They won’t produce any soon.  We may have to go ahead a little with our own.

	We mustn’t appear to be so much slower than R.

iii) Para 9 x/ is embarrassing in light of what I said in Jeneva.



Sal.	Still true that disarmament must be accompanied by world settlement.



S.Ll.	Anglo-Fr. plan is quite safe.  It’ dependent on control, &amp; practical proof of it.



P.M.	Let S.Ll. send note on this to H.M.

	Don’t deviate from Anglo-Fr. plan.



H.M.	But don’t press it too hard.



		Agreed :  Approve memo..

		Subject to P.M.’s glosses &amp; adherence to Anglo-Fr. plan.





		12.	German Prisoners of War.



H.M.	Germans are urging release of Raedar and Doenitz.

	R. is 79 : likely to die at any time.  We released Neurath on those grounds.

	D. is only 64 &amp; cd. become a figure in Germany.

	U.S. &amp; Fr. want to release both.

	Suggest we agree to R. not D.



		Approved.
