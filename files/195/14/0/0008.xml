C.M.29(55)							26th August, 1955





		1.	Economic Situation.		[Enter H.H., BH., B-C., H.W. 



R.A.B.	i)   Exchange situation.  Fundamentally not unsatisf.  Short-term shakiness due to confidence factors related to rumours of swinging on the rate (!)  M’while, however, we are in heavy deficit with E.P.U.

	Loss for Aug. may be 50% of that for July.  Drain is nothing like that wh. we were suffering when W.S.C. took office.

	No reason therefore to treat this as a crisis.  No ground for panic action.  Tho’ Sept. is unfavourable month.

	ii)  Results of measures taken.  Credit squeeze is taking effect.  B/E however is in diffies. because of Govt. need of money for l.a.’s, electricity etc.,   Action by Clearing Banks is v. stiff : &amp; results will be seen soon.  This is doing all it can do in private sector.  We must therefore back it by firm action in public sector.

iii) Wages pressure : continuing.  Due to brimful employmt.  Demands on labour are so heavy tht. inflation inevitable unless pressure is relieved.  This is answer to L.P.’s memo.

iv)  Action.  Package – not too soon.  Don’t advise recall of Parlt. Intensify measures taken in July.

	Bank rate : further increase now wd. not be effective.  P’pone it until “package” or later.

	Package must include more effective measures for reducg. public exp’re.

	a)   Cap. exp’re by l.a.’s : other than housg.   £215 M. in ’54 cpd £173 M ’51.				          housing £375 M. in ’54 cpd £295 M ’51

	We can’t therefore operate on this sector w’out cutting housing.  Some large cut in housing subsidy will be sound in itself and good for public confidence.  Shd. we include considn. of restoring bldg. controls?  Shall need to state tht. l.a. bldg. must drop back to 100,000.  I want saving of £100 M. in l.a. exp’re.  Wd. wish to ask l.a.’s for economies in the   £215 M.  by circular – valuable psychol. effect.

b)   Ty. have bn. pursuing other means of reducg. exp’re in public sector, incldg. natd. industries.  With exceptn. of coal &amp; atomic.

	Hope to be able to announce Oct. changes in Nat. Service.

	c)   Bread subsidy.  This may be the time to cut it out.  Wd. restore confidence abroad, tho’ it mght at home sharpen wages demand.  This last point must be considered.

d)   All Ministers must be ready to slow down p’mmes, if that wd. help to curb inflation.

New road p’mme must be delayed.  Rail hasn’t started.  Even education may have to make contribn. 

e)   Private industry.  F.B.I. wd. like us to appeal to firms not to spend reserves in unnecessary bldg. 

f)   Fiscal action (not to be recorded).  Revenue Bill cd. be turned into Autumn Budget, which wd. include increase in tax on distributed profits &amp; other measures on “capitalist” front – e.g. an attack on prices &amp; price margins, in co-opn. with employers, and on increasing scale of dividend distribn.  These last 2 cd. not be done by legn.  No increase in purchase tax.

v)   Exchange policy.  Gt. temptatn. in Exchange Control to say we are de facto convertible because of free exchange in commodities.  Also B/E. can’t resist saying tht. 2 rates as near together as they are is bad business.  But I’m not ready to go convertible while we are weak.  I wish to wait.  We may have to bring the 2 rates together &amp; widen the spread.  But U.S. now don’t want a wider spread.  At Istambul I will discuss with U.S. how to get out of free-trade consequences of de facto convertibility.  Think we may get agreemt. to this.  If so, &amp; if we restore domestic sitn., we may be able to face de facto convertibility next year.



P.M.	i)   Defence.  Programmes are being worked out w’in limit of £1580 + German contn.  This will involve considerable redns. by Services.  But can, &amp; ought to, be done.  This will free labour for civil purposes. There are redns. in our overseas commitments.  

Services  are considering how to adjust Nat. Service in such a way as to help to counter inflation with least damage to Service efficiency.

	I aim to announce Nat. Serv. decision before Parlt. meets.

ii)  Bank rate.  I agree with R.A.B. 

iii) Natd. industries.  I have talked to N.C.B.  Redn. in cap. exp’re wd. mean loss of coal.  I agree tht. coal &amp;atomic must be exempt fr. cuts. iv) On “package” plan.  We shall get support for necessary action : no praise for trimming.  We shd. not be afraid to do what we think is needed.  But need to keep a balance (rich and poor) &amp; avoid appearance of being hard-faced Tories.

v)  Convertibility.  Welcome proposal to discuss with U.S. means of tempering wind.  Don’t want to go convertible on fixed rate.  Risk of forced devaluation.  A floating rate wd. avoid these disastrous consequences.  We must at least have enough room to manoeuvre.



D.S.	It was a mistake to abandon bldg controls.  But it wd. be v. awkward politically to restore it now.

	Subsidy.  Have moved in step with R.A.B.  We are spending too much public money : &amp; we are subsidising many people who don’t need help.  Also widespread misconception of what a house shd. cost. 

	Ques is therefore one of means of approach.

While I favour redn. of subsidy, I am alarmed at RAB’s suggn. of reducg. l.a. bldg. to 100,000.  Is this restricted to “subsidised” houses?  If all l.a. bldg were reduced to that figure, &amp; if econ climate took private bldg below 100,000 as now, we mght find total below 200,000 not 300,000.

My idea : announce abolition of subsidy on houses for general needs in 2 years – with tapering off m’while.  Otherwise, l.a.’s mght stop bldg altogether.  Want to m’tain subsidy for “overspill” housing, as well as slum-clearance.  Having rationed no. at reduced subsidy, l.a.’s shd. be at liberty to build without subsidy for general needs.  To round this off, I wd. like to give a small increase in subsidy for slum-clearance : e.g. from £22.10.0 to £24.

The other half of this problem is Rent Control.  Are we to tackle that too?  On loss of subsidy, l.a.’s will prob. spread their increased costs of further bldg over all their stock of houses.  Differential rent schemes wd. then become more widespread.  Genl. effect will therefore be to increase rents of l.a. houses.  This will increase disparity with private rent-controlled houses.  But no-one save l’lords wd. welcome adjustments in rent-restriction.  This has ceased to be a sensible investment.  We may have to consider, with relaxn. of rent control, makg. it condn. that on vacancy they shd. be offered for sale to housing associations etc.,

	On balance, I favour drastic action on subsidies but delay on rent control – tho’ we may have to indicate what we have in mind on that.



R.A.B.	Forecast abolition of general subsidy, even tho’ it is tapered off.  Probably wise also to forecast action later on rent control.



P.M.	300,000 is a redn. on present figure : and it will be m’tained in 1956.



B.C.	Roads.  Exp’re for 16 yrs. has bn. far too low – this differentiates it fr. other p’mmes.  Present exp’re is 50% of pre-war in terms of g.n.p. or 33⅓% of Govt. exp’re – at a time when no. of road vehicles has doubled.  Little can be done by way of slowing down major schemes authorised – only increases cost.  Slowing down authorns. gives no immediate saving.  Minor improvemts &amp; m’tenanance.  This, in natl. exp’re, goes only on major roads.  On minor roads (where standard may be too high) l.a. exp’re only is involved.  Much of it is related to anti-accident precautions.  But what about Rural Roads Act : £4 M., wh. relates to least important roads of all.



P.M.	Plan announced in Feb. was £40 M.  This can go on.  We can’t have the further plan £90 M.  It must stand over until spring.  

	It was a mistake tht. roads were not improved when times were bad.  It wd. be a double mistake to go ahead now when times are good.



R.A.B.	Want more co-opn. from M/T. on m’tenanance.



H.A.	Favour tough &amp; balanced package in autumn.

	Bldg.	Favour forecast of action on rent control.

		Favour also stop in Govt. bldg.

	Encourage small saver.



H.	Can’t we do more to discourage expenditure on consumption.  What about sales tax vice purchase tax.



R.A.B.	Bread subsidy is a contribn. to that.

	But can re-consider p. tax in autumn.



D.E.	Don’t re-introduce bldg. controls.  V. cumbrous.  The increased rates of interest do operate as a control – &amp; a much less objectionable one.

	Balance of package.  I’m asked to reduce subsidy on school meals.  V. diff. politically but quite sound economically and socially.  If that were added to what R.A.B. already proposed, increased profits tax alone won’t balance it.  It is increased value of shares that annoys workers &amp; lower middle classes.  Can’t therefore rule out a capital gains tax.  Reduce surtax as against a capital gains tax. 



R.A.B.	R. Commn. has just reported v. capital gains tax.



P.M.	But, politically, D.E. is right. We must find something more.



W.	Or legn. freezing dividends for a period, e.g. 3 yrs.  Industry shd. hold more of its profits than it does nowadays.



RAB	Don’t believe it’s practicable.



H.W.	Support D.E., in general.

	Fr. T.U. point of view, limitn. of dividends wd. be more impressive than capital gains tax.



		Resume 5/9.





		2.	Industrial Relations.



H.W.	Wage claims threatening.

	Engineering &amp; shipbldg : employers will resist hours, but not wages.  Will try to settle for lowest figure.  This shows one danger.  “Package” announcement wd. help to stiffen employers.

	Farm workers.  Railways.  Miners.  All in prospect.

	Some announcemt. of Govt. intention to reduce prices wd. help to hold wages position.



B.C.	Trouble over hours in Ldn. buses.  May be strike in autumn.



							[Exit H.W.

[Enter Low.

		3.	Japan : Trade and Payments.



R.A.B.	Main comment : if we threaten Col. restn. at this stage, you throw away bargaining counter much too soon.

	Endorse H.M.’s view on shipping.



Low.	There is a diffy.  Para 5 of RAB.’s memo. – not enough to justify increased J. imports into Colonies.  We had trouble enough over last agreemt. wh. provided for another £4 M. sales to Colonies : this wd. provide for another £7 M.  We shall find it v. diff. to justify this to Lancs. or to H/C.



	J. do discriminate v. us now, administratively.  W’out an assurance that this will cease, we can’t count on getting all the trade we expect.  Quotas won’t give us as much as we hoped in June and we now have to pay in salmon for the smaller quotas we are to get.



H.H.	Col. posn. is fairly stated in R.A.B.’s memo.  Can’t easily ask Colonies to restrict their imports fr. J. save on b/p. grounds.

	B/T. proposals wd. apply only to Africa.  In E. Africa cheap J. textiles are in interests of people : that, I thght, was agreed.  In W. Africa there is growing demand for J. goods &amp; the Govts. there wd. not readily accept restriction of that save on b/p. grds.



K.	Para 26(a).  Is it merely a matter of timing?



R.A.B.	Yes.  I want to w’hold the decision on Colonies.



L.	We have bn. negotiating for 6 wks.  We can guess what we are likely to get – i.e. para 5 of R.A.B.’s memo.



H.A.	B/T. fears tht. despite our assurance undertakg. won’t be carried out.

	Cd. we link them more closely.



H.H.	The Col. weapon is getting blunt, now that we have independent Govts.  We can persuade them on b/p. grounds, but not for protn. of Lancs.



R.A.B.	Use the threat : &amp; see what agreement we can get.  If it’s not good enough, we cd. implement the threat.



Low.	I don’t think the agreement is good enough to warrant the assurance.



H.A.	Can we give final decisions before agreemt. is concluded?



R.A.B.	I think it shd. be.



Low.	If we give the assurance, &amp; get the agreemt. we asked for, we can’t w’draw the assurance.  Can I discuss with RAB before next Cab.?



		Agreed :  Low &amp; R.A.B. with H.H. to meet on Wedy.



							[Exit Low, B.C.

[Enter Carrington.

		4.	Cyprus.					



H.M.	Opens to-morrow.  Will consider which P.M. shd. see first.

	Security in Cyprus.  Cttee. agreed on apptmt. of Director of Security, who wd. assume “Templer” functions if situation became an operation.  Acting appointment has bn. made.

	Telegram re low morale of Police &amp; pressing for transfer of 7 or so fr. Kenya or Malaya.

Situation needs to be gripped.



H.M.	Trying to get these re-inforcemts. fr. Malaya, or ex-Sudan Police.



P.M.	Action shd. be taken urgently.



H.H.	Other posts created &amp; men drafted in fr. Canal Zone.



P.M.	T. toughness in early stages will help us.  Keep close to them.





		5.	Broadcasting : 14 day Rule.



P.M.	Cl. Davies wants to run out of his earlier agreemt. &amp; to publish corrce..  Have told him I won’t publish but he will have early opportunity of mtg. at wh. he can explain to other Parties why he has changed his mind.

	Cab. can consider merits later.





		6.	Disarmament.



H.M.	Risks aren’t as great as Cttee. suppose.  U.S. legn. debars them fr. allowing any inspn.  Let them make the running.  Don’t let us wreck it.  Listen to U.S. arguments : don’t take a line.  Don’t raise diffies.  Propose to instruct Nutting not to oppose.



		Agreed.





		7.	I.R.A. Raids.



P.M.	Explained additional precautions which are being taken &amp; those wh. may have to be taken if situation gets worse.

	Police handled this v. well.





		8.	Hong Kong : Loss of Indian Aircraft.



H.M.	Govr. shd. issue warrant for Chou’s arrest.  W’ton to be given one weeks’ advance notice in order to prepare their case v. accusation of U.S. complicity.

	Otherwise, Govr.’s action is approved.





		9.	Sudan.



H.M.	Neutral Commn. – incldg. neither Br. nor Egyptians.

	M’while, mutiny has broken out in south.  W. of Nile it seems to be dying down.

	We must support Khartoum Govt.  Helm may get thro’ w’out asking for more Br/Eg. troops than are in Sudan.

	Uganda : some troops have moved in there.  Govr. has made Regns. wh. will prevent their return to Sudan.

	Cohen’s suggns. (Tel. 601) shd. be referred to Khartoum for considn.  I will do so.



P.M.	We don’t want a Sudan dominated by E.  If this moves twds. a split, we must re-consider our posn.



H.M.	M’while we must support Khartoum Govt., w’out use of E. troops.

	If Govr. needs more troops, he can use first those earmarked for Sudan in Nov.  Don’t want more E. troops.

							[Exit H.H.





		10.	Bacon Prices.



H.A.	Early in year we cdn’t sell it.  Now there is shortage.  We have bn. increasg. prices – &amp; now it’s 12% above level at de-control.  Also we are makg. £½ M. p. wk. profit on imports.  I propose not to follow market up any higher because higher prices haven’t damped down demand.
