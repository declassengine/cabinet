C.M.9(56)							8th February, 1956





		1.	Queen’s Tour in Nigeria.	[Enter Att.G., E.H., Reading.



R.A.B.	Summarised lr. from Adeane.



A.L.B.	Nigerian Regt. has acquired Title Royal.





		2.	Export of Arms : India.



R.A.B.	P.M. has secured Eisenhowers’ agreement to waive security objn. to supply of specialised (bombing) equipment to India in Canberra aircraft.





		3.	Parliament.



R.A.B.	Business for next week.

	Monday : P.M. will prob. make statement on W’ton talks.

	Thursday : Capital Punishment must be debated then or on a day in following week.  Don’t wish, however, to inform H/C. of this until H.M. has bn. able to discuss with P.M. wtr economic debate shd. not take place on Thursday.

	Ques : do we keep Thursdays’ business open – or offer Cap. Punishment and change business later.



		Agreed : preferable to keep it open – on basis that P.M. is not 

yet back.





		4.	House of Commons. Disqualification Bill.	[Enter Milligan



Att.G.	Oppn. demand y’day that whole ques be referred to Sel. Cttee.  Para. 13 of report lends support to that move.

	Will be further pressure for this, when Beatty motion comes fwd. on Monday.



R.A.B.	Choice : refer Cl. 6. (contracts) or whole Bill to Sel. Cttee.

	I favour 2nd. course.  Means we shan’t get Bill this Session.  Don’t mind that. 

	May have to hold 2nd. Rdg. debate afresh, after report of Sel. Cttee.



Ll.G.	Shall get criticism for further delay.  But that is lesser evil.



		Agreed  :	Refer whole Bill to Sel. Cttee.

				L.P.S. authorised to announce accordingly on

				Thursday.





		5.	Capital Punishment.



Ll.G.	de Freitas has tabled Motion advocatg. suspension of penalty for period of years.  This wd. be called in preference to Motion by back-bench supporter of Govt.  This seems to point to need for a Govt. motion.  And that is desired by our supporters – who wd. welcome a lead from Govt.  Even those who favour abolition wd. be ready to vote in favour of retn. if Govt. made clear their intention to legislate on secondary matters covered by Heald Cttee.



E.H.	Govt. motion wd. make it easier to get nobblers to support retention.

	Form of motion : put first the promise of amendg. legn. and continue “meanwhile penalty shd. remain”.



Ll.G.	Mustn’t imply tht. penalty will be abolished when that legn. has bn. passed.



R.A.B.	Will not be easy to frame legn. on secondary matters.  Most unlikely that it cd. be ready for this session.



Att.G.	We must on that a/c be guarded about what precisely will go into this legn.



Ld. Adv.	Sc. common law of diminished responsibility to be applied by statute to E. &amp; Wales.  The legn. need not therefore be applied to Scotland.



J.S.	Unless we have to cover Geneva Convention.



Att.G.	We needn’t take a decn. or make an announcement, on that point at present.



D.S.	Presume Ll.G. won’t define precisely which points will be included in the legn.



R.A.B.	Wiser to leave content open – for review in light of suggns. made in debate.

	In particular, inexpedient to promise that it will raise age-limit to 21.



		Agreed  :	Table Govt. motion.

				L.P.S. to draft [with Ll.G., K., J.S., Solr. Genl] – 			on lines of promisg. amendment of law, while 			c.p. shd. be retained as part of the law of the 				land.



H.A.	I wd. find it diff. to support such a Motion, but would be willing to abstain.



I.M.	I am in same position as H.A.



		Agreed  :	Free vote for back-benchers.  Members of Govt. 			not to vote against Motion.



K.	Think we must promise to legislate to narrow the law on constructive malice and provocation.			Agreed.



		Govt. spokesman in debate – to be settled by P.M.



							[Exit Att. G., Ld. Adv. 						         P.T.

[Enter B-C.

6.	Widows’ Pensions.												

B.C.	Wd. not propose to announce decn. until end/February.

	But wd. be glad if decisions cd. be taken now.



H.M.	On main recommns. – no commend.  I accept proposals, despite the cost.



Ll.G.	Repercussions – on police &amp; firemen’s widows – can’t avoid consequential increases.



I.M.	Linking rule.  Adopt recommn. – advantage of accepting report as a whole.

10/= Widows.



B.C.	This is ques of pol. judgement.  Can we stand on the 10/= and get away with it.  Almost every other pension has bn. raised since 1945.

	Gt. pressure, in Party &amp; outside it.  And expectns. tht. Cttee. wd. deal with it.

	If we believe we can’t hold posn., much to be said for takg. initiative wh. will enable us to cut off new entrants.

	Para. 56 of Cttee.’s Rpt. reproduces pledge of Coalition Govt. – but it needn’t be construed as promise to continue these pensions for ever.



H.M.	This is hangover fr. Chamberlain Govt. when widowhood as such was regarded as qualifn. for pension.  It wasn’t v. popular.  And conception has bn. abandoned since Beveridge.

	No reason to spend £2 M. on increasing rate.  The increase wd. go to types of widow who either didn’t need it or because on N. Assistance wdn’t benefit from it.



	Large no. of other non-contriby. pensions – which wd. be much more expensive to bring up to higher rates.  

Therefore, I wd. stand on 10/= and cut off new entrants.

	Can’t we stand firm on this.  Doctrine is accepted.  We can resist sentiment – esp. in present economic circs.

	No case in logic.  Little case on need.



B.C.	Don’t believe old non-contriby. pension wd. have to be raised in consequence.  They have bn. absorbed in N. Assistance.



H.M.	If so, it wd. not cost £6 M.  That figure shows there are many who are not on N. Assistance.



D.S.	Gt. feeling of injustice about 10/= pensions.  Were it not for economic measures we are proposing, I wd. favour increasg. it.



Ll.G.	Expectations aroused tht. Cttee. wd. cover it – makes it v. diff. for us.



R.A.B.	(1)  Review this in light of climate of opinion created by announcement of general economic measures.

	(2)  B.C. to circulate memo. summarising what has bn. said about these widows.



I.M.	Don’t believe you cd. stand on 10/= and cut off new entrants.



H.M.	Perhaps not.  Choice may be between raising + cut off or standing pat.  I accept that position.





		7.	Malaya.



A.L.B.	Agreements will be signed today.

	Defence, security etc., are adequately safeguarded.

	We have accepted p’ressive w’drawal of B. advisers.

	Accepted Aug. ’57 as a hope.

	Posn. of Queen as sovereign of Settlements.  Form of words accepted.  Will submit detailed report to Cab. – and t. of r. of Constitutional Commission.

	Assurances re Br. trade &amp; economic interests have bn. included in report.  Dpts. agreed tht. binding agreemt. wd. add nothing.
