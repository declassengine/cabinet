C.M.23(56)							15th March, 1956





		1.	Bahrain.			[Enter E.H., A.N., R., CIGS. D.



		[Bahr. 221. C.O.S. Mccos. 115.]



A.N.	Courses	i) back Committee.  But strike will go on for some time then.

	ii) bring in 117 Iraqi police, whom Ruler wants but his 

	advisers think wd. inflame situation.

		iii) use of Br. troops.  Either to clear streets &amp; restore order : 

		or to take over static duties of police &amp; free them for restorn. 

		of order.

		x|  But must be clearly on responsibility of Ruler.



P.M.	Iraqis are en route.  Will look indecisive to divert them now.



CIGS.	Signal from Commrs. M/E., who think use of Br. troops may in long term have adverse affect.  My view : if used, must be at clear request Ruler.

	Position of troops in Bahrain, Sharja + 2 cos. at 24 hrs’ in Aden &amp; N. Africa.



P.M.	Wd. Cab. support 2nd. alternative under (iii).  Police may get worn out &amp; thing will then get well out of hand.



D.S.	Opportunity to show firmness?



P.M.	The Cttee. is not anti-British : body of conservative merchants.  Tell Burrows sitn. can’t continue.  He can tell Ruler x/ is available.  Will that be enough?  We shd. have Burrows’ judgmt. on that.



W.M.	Long-term remedy : strengthen Police.



CIGS.	Beware of turning opposn. to Ruler into anti-Br. feeling



S.	Ruler wants suppress riots : asked for Br. troops (we say they can’t be used) : he then wants to use Iraqis (we deprecate that).  What help are we giving?



A.N.	The Iraqi re-inforcemt. was suggd. some time ago.



C.I.G.S.	Bahrain won’t for years produce police leaders : they must come from outside.



P.M.	Send telegram to Burrows – adding reminder of standing instruction that if v. serious sitn. arises Br. troops may be used to restore it.



H.M.	Is it wise to discourage arrival of Iraq policemen, if Ruler wants them.



A.N.	We cd. tell Iraqis to send them in smaller packets &amp; to delay arrival for a week or so.



S.	If we don’t want Br. troops to be used, we shdn’t discourage arrival of Iraqis.

							[Exit D., CIGS., A.N.



2.	Parliament.



R.A.B.	20/3 : debate on employment situation.  Speakers : M/L &amp; M/St. B/T.

	21/3 : debate on Security (Privy Councillors) ½ day.  Spkr. Ll.G.

	Will announce Budget date : 17/4.

	   ..          ..        Easter Recess : 29/3 to 10/4.





3.	Broadcasting : 14 Day Rule.



R.A.B.	My evidence, on lines suggd., was well received.

	May have to be concession on rule preventg. M.P. fr. spkg. on a Bill from introduction to R. Assent.  I suggd. one rule for M.P.’s &amp; others &amp; less restrictive in time.





4.	Valuation for Rating.



D.S.	W. Paper to be presented to-day.  Shall also be answering P.Q.

	Our point for Cab.  “At present Govt. are reviewg. l.g. finance in all its aspects …. Until x/this/ is complete, can’t assess finally weight of rate burden.”  J.S. thinks last sentence foreshadows de-rating.



H.M.	Make it clear that x/ = review of l.g. finance, not merely the re-valuation.



R.A.B.	Don’t arouse premature hopes of shop-keepers.



P.T.	Will only transfer trouble to business-men.

								[Exit D.S.

[Enter H.A.

		5.	British Transport Commission Finances.		



H.M.	H.W. proposes to make legalistic statement to-day.

	I wd. prefer to defer this – e.g. until after P.M.’s mtg. with natd. indies. on Wed.



I.M.	Diffy. over that is that it is transport industry only.



H.M.	We cd. issue it on Mon. &amp; pick it up in communiqué after mtg. on Wed.





		6.	Farm Price Review.



H.A.	Draft of announcement – for to-day.



		Approved.





		7.	Industrial Relations : White Paper.



H.M.	Recommend early publication.



RAB.	Improved – esp. paras. 25 &amp; 26.

	But still a v. genl. document.

	Won’t do us much good with Party.  Puts us rather much in line with policies of our predecessors.  A little bi-partisan.



H.A.	V. balanced documents.

	But one or two points cd. have more emphasis – e.g. savings &amp; exports.  Part V &amp; p. 6.  Won’t make a v. big impact.



P.M.	Background stuff like Econ. Survey

	But Ministers must then hammer home Govt.’s main themes.  e.g. High productivity &amp; high wages : savings etc.,  Some prelimy. work has bn. done by Ty., No. 10 &amp; C.o.I. &amp;. RO’s.



H.M.	Popular version.  Will submit this to Cab. after consultn. with Central Office.



I.M.	Title : Shd. be “Econ. Implns. of F.E.”



I.M.	Timing.  Want it out before Easter, but not before next Tuesday’s debate.  Wd. suggest Mon. week.



P.M.	Or next Thursday.  22/3.  



H.M. 	As suggd. in my memo. 					Agreed.



P.M.	Campaign for follow-up by Ministers etc.,  L.P.S. to take charge of that.  This will look after Party aspects.





8.	Economic Survey.



R.A.B.	Doesn’t bring out Comm. Fin. Ministers agreemt. tht. we shd. take strain on reserves while Comm. developmt. was going fwd.



H.M.	Can say, in Budget speech, tht. we did this consciously : tht. it will take longer time to produce results : we must therefore live on reserves for a bit longer.  Mustn’t therefore keep on takg. our temperature.



R.A.B.	Hope you will.  



H.M.	Will need gt. care, lest confidence wobbles.



P.M.	Gloomy graph on p. 27.



P.T.	But remember (left of Chart) where Germany was pre-war.



R.A.B.	Para. 82.  Cd. we use word “suspend”.



		Approved for publication.





		9.	British Industries Fair.



P.T.	London section is bankrupt.  It was declining when Govt. ran it.  If it is to continue, we shall have to raise grant from £1 to 5 thous.  But even then it won’t pay its way.

	I believe right course is to close it down.  Recommend as in §10.



H.M.	Generalised fairs are not best method.  Specialised publicity earns more.  B’ham can take place of this.

	Problem : to avoid unfavourable impression.

	We must see that this (Apl.) occasion pays out its debts in full.  Tho’ this will need a Suppl. Estimate.



H.	Hope whole ques. of overseas Fairs will be scrutinised.  We do v. badly in some.



P.T.	Because B. industries don’t believe in them.



H.	Better not show at all if our exhibits can’t be good.



P.T.	Will go into this, with F.O. – &amp; frame a new policy.



H.A.	Avoid “national pavilions”.



R.A.B.	Para. 3?  



P.T. 	All natl. organns. are against it, incldg. T.U.C.





10.	Malta.



A.L.B.	K., RAB. &amp; I are seeing 1922 this p.m.

	Hope Cab. will agree tht., subject to results of that, we shd. go on with a Motion favourg. in principle recommns. of Conference.

	In any event recommend debate before Easter.

	Final form of Motion can turn on our discns. with 1922.



K.	Support this view.



R.A.B.	Party is divided.  And have impn. tht. Govt. are less firm.

	We must take their views before Cab. considers form of Motion.  We have had prelimy. talk about it. – A.L.B. &amp; K.



A.L.B.	Party haven’t realised gravity of local sitn. or dangers of another Cyprus.



K.	If Parlt. don’t accept Rpt., A’bishop &amp; Miss S. will assume tht. integration can be shoved off.  Miss S. is v. precipitate.  A’bishop may even ex-communicate Mintoff and his principal leaders.



H.	There will be much oppn.

	Two other courses	i) Ask Malta to get firm opinion by Election.

				ii) Offer (as no firm opinion) S.J.C. of both 				Houses mtg. 3 mos. each year.



A.L.B.	Course ii) wd. get nowhere.  It wd. satisfy no one but Miss S.

	Course i). No indicn. by our Parlt. of its view, for 7 mos. after Rept., wd. embitter Mintoff.  He wd. win Election &amp; mght put fwd. more extreme proposals.



K.	He mght decline to have Election w’out some decln. of W’minster’s view – tho’ that view wd. include proviso re further indicn of views of Maltese people.  Parlt’s approval wd. be conditional on that.

	2 Elections &amp; a referendum wd. give as clear an indication of people’s views as we cd. require.

	With no indicn. of Parlt’s views – not even a discn. – M. wdn’t go on.



H.A.	We have no practical alternative, much as I dislike this.

	Dangers of takg. this undesirable step are not less than those of a deteriorating sitn. in Malta.



Ll.G.	Why shd. we let Malta down by declining to express a view before we have clear indicn. of Malta’s view?  Debate, w’out a clear decn., wd. suffice.



P.T.	Agree with H. &amp; H.A.  We can’t go back now.  We must ask Parlt. to give a view conditional on further expn. of Malta’s view.



RAB.	Cd. this go by stages – integration coming last.



K.	That is the proposal in Rpt.  The Maltese M.P.’s don’t come into this Parlt.



H.M.	Favour this.  Dramatic &amp; unprecedented act.  Never before have we taken anyone in.  If we do it, don’t be grudging about it.  When Br. prestige is lower than ever, someone comes along &amp; asks for closer association.



P.M.	Gaitskell wants to see me (with J.G. &amp; A.B.) to-morrow about this.  What do we say to them?  Can’t haver then.



A.L.B.	You can promise debate before Easter.



RAB.	Then say in reply to P.Q. to-day tht. we hope to arrange this.
