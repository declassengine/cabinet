C.M.13(56)							14th February, 1956





		1.	Restrictive Trade Practices Bill.	[Enter R.M., Att. Gen., 								 Ld. Adv., E.H.



K.	Explained provisions of Bill on lines of Conclns. in para. 20 of memo.

	a) Details in Cl. 5.

	b) Nature of tribunal : statement of justiciable issue (Cl. 16 : issues which are about 80% factual, so that a judicial body can properly pronounce on them – tho’ qualitative &amp; economic judgement cannot be wholly excluded.) = “prosecuting authority”.  Att.G. will nominate counsel &amp; appear in important cases.

	c) Re-sale price maintenance.  Much public &amp; Press opinion against collective enforcement.  This will be made illegal.  But individual enforcement will be open under Cl. 20.

	d) Monopolies Commn. to continue.



P.M.	Labour.  E.P.C. discussion.



P.T.	Cttee. agreed Bill cd. not cover labour practices.  But there will be comment.  Not much from Govt. supporters.  M/L. will say that we will discuss with N.J.A.C.I.  Also officials are considg. what other action cd. be taken.



P.M.	Appln. to iron &amp; steel industry?



P.T.	Bd. will ask for exclusion &amp; new powers to Bd. to exercise similar control.

	K. &amp; RAB. have both seen Chairman.  We shall have to see him again before Bill is introduced.



R.A.B.	Doubt if Bd. will accept position.  Some practices are so closely connected with Bd.’s functions that Bd. cd. &amp; shd. exercise these powers.  His latest lr. comes ½ way to meet us.  Suggest K. sees him again &amp; discloses some of detail of Bill.  Promise also to debate in H/C. such remaing. points as his repves. may bring fwd. there.



		Agreed :  K., P.T. to see Forbes this p.m.



J.S.	Herring &amp; White Fish Industry – see below.



P.M.	Judicial examination.



	Hope that, as time goes on, increasing. no. will be by consent.

	Also summary procdgs.



P.T.	Government Departments.



	Some Dpts. linked with a ring., e.g. Post Office on cables.

	If a ring includes a Dpt., it becomes exempt from legn.  Otherwise Crown wd. be involved on both sides.  Recommend therefore tht. Crown privilege shd. stand : but that Dpts. shd. progressively extricate themselves from the more notorious rings.

	Attention of Dpts. concerns shd. be drawn to this need.  *Ty. and B/T.



	Registrar.  C.P. 37.



P.M.	Ministerial responsibility?



K.	P.M. for qualifns. of person appointed.



P.T.	Accept proposals in C.P. 37.					Approved.



P.T.	Monopolies Commission.  Bound to be some delay.  Can’t avoid it.  Govt. can’t continue to make executive orders on matters now made justiciable.



	Resale Price Maintenance.  Compromise accepted.



Application to Scotland. 



K.	Agreements wholly Scottish will be brought before a Court in Scotland.  This can be secured by Rules.



	Herring &amp; White Fish Industries.



J.S.	These Bds. are full of restrictive policies.

	The Bds. &amp; their supporters in H/C. won’t stomach appln. of Cl. 16(1) to these industries.



P.T.	Any statutory scheme is excluded – Cl.6(1).  But Bill would apply to practices additional to those of statutory scheme.  Those will be registerable.  Best to rely on Cl. 6(1): and for the rest safeguard the posn. by our power to influence order in which agreements are called up.



I.M.	Ques wtr (or rather the order in which) issues comes to the court is in discretion of B/T.



		Approved Bill.

		Authorised introduction this week. (Wed.).



						[Exit Att.G., R.M., Ld. Adv.



		2.	Economic Situation.



A.L.B.	Suggn. for savings.  Doubling Colonial loans, now £20 M.  Raise maximum to £2.000.  And low units – £1.  Open to small investor.



H.M.	Valuable contn. to general project for reviving savings habits.



H.M.	Opinion in Cab. y’day was fairly evenly divided.

	Have sought means of reachg. agreement.

	We broadly agree that food subsidies shd. be abandoned, at right moment.  Ques is timing &amp; circs. &amp; atmosphere of such action.

	P.M. fears brusque announcement, w’out any prelimy. discn. wd. appear as harsh &amp; brutal attack on workers.  Wd. damage P.M.’s reputn. for fairness &amp; fair play.  Esp. after B’fd. speech invitg co-opn. of workers.

	How can we gain some time &amp; overcome P.M.’s diffy. – wh. is psychological rather than economic.

	My resign. wd. injure Party &amp; economic sitn. we are trying to cure.  I recognise that.

	But hope Cab. will also see tht. a Chanc. apptd. as I was cannot be strong unless his judgement is supported. 

	Unsteady financial sitn. is worsening.  Fin. Times to-day.  Expectns. of early action.  Can’t wait therefore until Budget.  But v. weakening of posn. &amp; speculn. about devaluation makes action easier to take.  If we really face a run, meriting devaluation, Cab. wd. be readier to take drastic action.  I don’t say we have reached this point.  I believe we cd. get by w’out action now – but might then collapse in summer.  But somethg. must be done now.  Govr. ready to raise Bank Rate.  Wd. volunteer it if Cab. authd. whole package – but not if action on b. &amp; m.  They wd. then need a direction to do it.



								[Enter D.S.



	Modified time-table.  Raise Bank Rate Thursday.  Statement that day offering debate on Mon./Tues. or Tues/Wed. but makg. it clear that this was one of the measures to be announced in following debate.  So as to make it clear tht. Govt. initiative is preserved.  Then P.M. to see T.U.C. on Fri. or week-end : say Bank Rate indicates serious situation : but indicate what further measures Govt. feel obliged to take in natl. interest.



P.M.	Any breach in Cab. wd. certainly be deplorable in its consequences – on econ. situation as well as our fortunes.

	My reflections.  Have we not under-estimated other elements in package – esp. h.p. proposals.  Wd. be possible to make statement covering all save b. and m. : and say these are only part of our measures – those we must bring into effect at once – but add that they will be followed by others wh. are connected with fiscal measures &amp; must therefore wait.  That wd. give us more time for talks with T.U.C.

	Effect of incldg. b. and m. is not merely psychological.  For, if it produced industrial strife, that condition wd. not inspire increased confidence in sterling.



R.A.B.	Seems tht. B/E. will only raise Bank Rate if certain Govt. action is taken.

	My advice fr. Jan 55 from B/E. was bad.  His pol. judgement is not reliable.

	Does Govr. seek to attach conditions?  There is a case for Bank Rate w’out regard to these considns.



H.M.	I am not willing to direct him to do this, unless I think Govt. action proposed justifies such a direction.



P.M.	Under my plan, we wd. have to assess what industry wd. be willing to do by way of restraint.  It might be such that. it wd. be neither wise nor necessary to do b. and m. – even in Budget.



H.M.	Chief anxiety is that T.U.’s shd. not use this removal of last subsidy as excuse for industrial strife.  Can they not be persuaded that this is not to be done as gesture of “hard-faced” Tory Govt. – not prelude to further savage action v. workers.



P.M.	Can we achieve that in one mtg.?



A.L.B.	Bye-elections are another reason for delaying statement – Wed. wd. be inappropriate.



I.M.	Not much hope of progress with T.U.’s if this is to come v. soon after.

	If this cd. be p’poned until Budget : we mght decide now to do it then if talks had produced no more favourable prospect.



D.E.	We shd. do b. and m. now or never.  It wd. wreck Budget as H.M. now envisages it because it destroys due balance.

	Also Unions wd. regard it as sharp practice if done immediately after important wages award.

	Can we do w’out it now?  Package contains h.p. on consumptn. and cuts on investment – wh. don’t give us enough.  We ought to cut more on consumption.  But what else cd. we do?

	B. and m. is symbolic – that is its real importance.

	Will public re-act so violently against it?  cf. revaluation.  People are expectg. some ugly things to happen soon.



S.Ll.	Why attack consumption exp’re by means which will generate even more spendg. power?  This gives impetus to inflation w’in a few months.



H.M.	Early cut in food subsidies did not have that effect.



R.A.B.	But we were then entering on a slump.  Was on a deflationary situatn.  And impact was dulled by concessions to pensioners etc.,



H.M.	Re-action of workers.  Will it really be ugly industrial feeling?  That I wd. deplore.  A mere political row wd. not matter v. much.



P.M.	Believe effect will be eroded so quickly that bankers’ confidence will not be restored for long.



H.M.	The real bitterness will come from the unemployment produced by the disinflation.



D.S.	Don’t want balance of Budget to be disturbed by incln. of bread proposal.

	It might, as suggd. by I.M., be introduced in mid-March, in light of progress of talks with industry.

	But I wdn’t mind much if it were dropped – if it can’t be done now.



K.	The diffce. betwn. us is our estimate of the bitterness which this wd. make in wages negotiation.



W.M.	I have not favoured doing b. &amp; m. at any time.  But if Cab. decided to do it at some future date I wd. bow to that decision.



P.T.	Package isn’t so bad.  Credit squeeze is workg.  B. Rate will emphasise that.  So will further investment cuts.  H. purchase is strong meat.  And further statement that we won’t flinch fr. consequences when they appear in form of unemplt.

	With all of that, he mght be able to do w’out b. and m.  Tho’ I have always favoured doing it.



D.S.	I wd. go with that.  Prs. package cd. be re-inforced by other means.



RAB.	What means are there – save cut in def. exp’re and liberalisation.
