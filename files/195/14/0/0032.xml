C.M.22(56)							13th March, 1956





		1.	Aircraft for India.		[Enter E.H., R., R.M., N.B., A.N.



H.	This offer is better than M. Macdonald suggd.

	Ques:   i) do we accept consequences for R.A.F.

		ii) do we make it condn. tht. India buys no R. aircraft.



N.B.	It wd. involve sacrifice for R.A.F. – and detriment to N.A.T.O.  But we wd. accept these consequences if there is over-riding advantage.



R.M.	No adv. to N.Ireland : they cdn’t re-open that prodn. line in time.



P.M.	V. tiresome to have to forego trade with Venezuela – a good customer, who supplies us with oil.



R.M.	That order is unlikely to mature.



S.	What assurance that N. will refrain for long fr. buying R. aircraft.  M’while we shall have delayed supplies to Pakistan &amp; Australia.



H.	He prob. won’t take decn. until after talk with M’batten.



N.B.	Security : our experience suggests tht. India wd. have to keep in touch with R. suppliers for 3 yrs. – and have technical experts permanently for the radar equipment.  Leakage thro’ Indian officers at I.D.C.



H.	If such a good offer as this is to be made, we shd. make (ii) a condn. – in message from P.M.



P.M.	This sacrifice is worthwhile only if India will base her Air Force on B.’craft.



H.M.	Financial cost of this concession is v. large.

	I cdn’t accept condn. suggd. in para. 7(b).

	Don’t believe we shall get undertakg. fr. India not to buy R. aircraft.  That wd. involve inconsistency with his Policy of non-alignment.  Most we cd. expect is that he will not do it.



P.M.	x/	Alternative lower offer (the 2nd. choice) if we don’t get assurance.



H.	N. has told Dulles of this possibility – he said it wd. have deplorable effect in U.S.

	A third course wd. be to hold over decn. until P.M.M.



		Agreed :	Put alternative offers – on grounds that we

				have many other demands for Canberras,

				incldg. those of R.A.F. itself.  Make clear to 

				him the nature of the concessions we have made.

			Prob. better for M.M, to put larger offer first with

			knowledge tht. he can fall back on the lesser.

			H. &amp; H.M. to submit draft telegram to P.M.



								[Exit N.B., R.M.

2.	Jordan.



P.M.	Mtg. y’day with Kirkbride.

	M/D. and CIGS. have plan for mil. mission – hopeful.

	K. thinks posn. is more promising because of Hussein’s rebuff to Cairo Powers.

	Discouraging reply fr. Eis. on B. Pact, tho’ an ambiguous p.s.  May be we can shift him when Dulles is back.  Our aim shd. be to get Jordan, then Syria, into Pact – long-term.

	Kings of Iraq &amp; J. will meet to-morrow.

	S.Ll. told not to visit Amman.





3.	Israel.



	Dulles precedent not useful because at that time I. F.O. was in Tel-Aviv.  It has now bn. moved to Jerusalem.

	He will therefore pay formal visits in Jerusalem, but issue statement that it doesn’t imply recognition.  We are informing I. and saying they mustn’t contradict it.





4.	Turkey : Cyprus.



P.M.	In reply to S.Ll., have discouraged Turks fr. making statement on Cyprus.  Have thght, on reflection, it better for T. to say we have gone to extreme limit of concession in our discn. with A’bishop.



A.N.	Wd. they care to add : A’bishop’s motive has bn. to set himself up as sole negotiator in constitutional ques.

								[Exit A.N.



5.	Broadcasting : 14 Day Rule.



R.A.B.	Have discd. with PMG. &amp; Ch. Whip what evce. I give to Sel. Cttee.  Shall promise Govt. consn. of their recommns.  But am disposed to suggest ban shd. extend only fr. announcemt. of business on Thursdays until subject is actually discussed.



P.M.	Don’t go below 7 days.  Yr. formula wd. be a 4-5 day rule.

	Re-affirm principle clearly.



B.H.	It isn’t a 14 day rule now.  It goes, in effect, by weeks.



RAB.	I.T.A. introduces complication.  Can’t work it in practice save on such a line as I suggest.



P.M.	What about 14 days subject to exceptions.



R.A.B.	I will reserve Govt.’s decn.

	I can say it covers anythg. announced for “wk. after next.”





6.	Parliament : Remuneration of Members.



R.A.B.	Opposn. are raisg. it with me to-day.  Have discussed with 1922 Executive : they think it may be feasible to bounce thro’ all 3 fairly soon.  What about a plan at time of Budget?

	What Party want to avoid is more talk about it.

	I won’t give any promises to Oppn.  Will ask them to wait a little longer.



H.M.	My classifn. wd. be “relief for middle classes.”  Wdn’t include H/L. in that!





7.	Cyprus : Athens Broadcasts.



A.L.B.	Form of motion for debate – approved.



S.	Debate in H/L. on 15/3 – on Cyprus &amp; Jordan.



A.L.B.	Cab. decn. of 6/3 re jamming from Malta.  Can’t give firm assurance tht. we shan’t interfere with other p’mmes.  This wd. be marginal.  But Govr. takes view that Mintoff must be told.  He is here now.  He wd. certainly tell Labour Party : mght make this condn. for some new demand.

	My view now therefore is tht. we shd. supplement Cyprus jamming by D.W.S. action from U.K.

	Alternative is to leave jamming only partially effective.



P.M.	Sure we shd. not do this fr. Malta.

	Can it be done from here?



C.H.	Technically : action from U.K. supplementg Cyprus action is on the whole better.  Wd. involve new aerials (one week) &amp; diversion of some commercial radio [channels] services.  Mght be possible to use Service channels.

	Even so, Cyprus action shd. be improved.  Senior engineer shd. be seconded (one in Air Min.?) to study problem as a whole with authority to deal with matter.

P.M.	Yes : subject to Ministerial supervision.



		Agreed :	P.M.G. &amp; C.O. to concert a plan with Service 

				Dpts. and to appoint a single expert to carry it 			out, subject to Ministerial supervision.  Cyprus 

				and suppln. from U.K.

								[Exit P.M.G., C.

[Enter H.W., A.J.

8.	B. Transport Commission : Finance.			

		

Not heard.





9.	Nationalised Industries.



H.M.	This money cdn’t be raised w’out Govt. guarantee.  For i) insufft. confidence  ii) insufft. savings for such large loans.

	In fact Bank can’t sell it even with . guarantee &amp; we are therefore backing it with Ty. Bills.

	Ques. : can we get reasonable terms for funding.  

	Propose tht. we finance these industries &amp; fund the loans as &amp; when we can.

	In a sense re-actionary because adds to no. of things Govt. have to finance.  Also inconsistent with Herbert Cttee. Rpt.  But not practicable to float these loans w’out Govt. guarantee.

x/ Local loans easier because secured on rates &amp; issued in small packets.

	Urgent because Bds. are negotiating renewal of over-drafts.

	Seek authority therefore to announce soon tht. I will do 	 [Enter J.S.

	this by clause in Finance Bill.



R.A.B.	Havg. got l.a.’s on to market : may be tht. putting natd. indies. on Exchequer will be precedent for future Labour action of same kind in respect of l.a.’s.

	Also : feeling in party is in favour of opposite course, as recommended by Herbert Cttee.

	Political points.  Can hope to deal with Parlt. more easily on this if City and Banks were known to agree.



H.M.	Cd. take powers, exercisable over 2 yrs. – limitn. prs. by total amount.  



RAB.	Yes : don’t bequeath this to Socialists.



R.A.B.	Will increase deficit below line – &amp; thus increase pressure for overall surpluses.



J.S.	Para. 5.  Compare with what we have said to l.a.’s	           [Enter H.A.

	How explain difference?



H.M.	As at x/ overleaf.



D.E.	Presentn. is diff.  Not generally known tht. stocks of these natd. indies. have bn. paid by Ty. Bills.

	Represent it as means of getting tighter control over indies.

	Means admitting we are bankrupt of savings.



H.M.	We must make a campaign re savings anyway.  I mean to.



D.E.	Tie it up with that.  By itself it wd. be a blow to our credit.	     Agreed.



								[Exit H.W., A.J.

10.	Malta.



A.L.B.	Para. 10.  Govrs’ analysis : paras 21-22.

	Propose we accept Conf. recommns. in principle – provided tht. R.C. and Labour in Malta reach an accommodation, and tht. there will be thereafter a final Maltese decn. by election.

	Before announcg. this, K. and I shd. see 1922 Cttee.  Then issue Wh. Paper before debate, which shd. be, if poss., before Easter.



R.A.B.	Doubt if Party is ready for such a motion.

	Para. 22 of Govr’s report.  Are we really ready for debate at W’minster – before we get things clearer in Malta itself.

	Opinion in Party is opposed to immediate decn.  Need for more prepn.



ALB	But m’while situation in Malta is deteriorating.



E.H.	H.C. promised a debate in wh. views cd. be expd. – i.e. on a motion to take note of Rpt.



P.M.	Are Oppn. in favour of early definitive debate?



K.	Malta will be upset if we don’t take a view on Rpt.

	Mintoff may become hostile.

	Inter-Party feeling in Malta is v. bitter.  Failg. general approval of Rpt. fear tht. it may go v. sour indeed.



ALB.	M. mght go for independence and a Treaty relation.

	The motion wd. have its provisos.

	Cdn’t have debate w’out Govt. view.



P.M.	*/But cd. have debate, w’out Motion, in wh,. Govt. view wd. be stated (rather tentatively)



ALB. and K	We wd. accept that.



H.	Believe we are now so far committed that we must go on.  But need A.L.B. be v. dogmatic at this stage.



P.M.	He needn’t commit Govt. finally.



E.H.	Party now believe – with relief – tht. Govt. are not going to favour integration.



J.S.	It worries me personally.  Doubt if I cd. agree to repn. of these irresponsible people.

	Malta wants money.  We mght have to give them more.



ALB.	But in Malta it has now become ques of prestige.



B.H.	Never has bn. a majority in Party in favour of this.



P.M.	But we cdn’t stand another Cyprus in Malta.



K.	No one has asked for more than £5 M. we offered.

	Are we to rebuff an offer of closer assocn. by an Island which joined us voluntarily in Napoleonic War &amp; has stood by us in 2 world wars of 20th. century.  Esp. at a time when we are havg. so much trouble with other Colonies seeking to draw away.



A.L.B.	Line at x/ wd. involve some delay.  Cdn’t ask Malta to hold election before Parlt. had expd. definite view.  We cd., however, go on with R.C./Mintoff consultns.



K.	Debate wd. make it clear we wdn’t interfere with R.C. interests.  Wd. enable us to soothe down that side of ques.



S.	Position must be gripped.  Shan’t do that w’out debate on Motion.



R.A.B.	z|	Cd. consider a motion on lines of latter phrases in draft.



H.	y/	Or follow x/ and then, after 2 days, announce Govt. decision in light of debate.



K.	V. risky.  Easter is period for R.C.’s to work up agitn.

	Wd. prefer z/



I.M.	Make it more clear in motion z/ tht. “verdict” refers to another election.



K.	Enough to say this in debate.



H.M.	And use in motion words wh. don’t (because of Rpt.) recall election.



		Agreed :	Resume discussion on Thursday on basis

				of draft motion.

				K. &amp; A.L.B. to discuss with 1922 Cttee. on

				Thursday p.m.





11.	China : Parliamentary Delegation.



		Agreed :	Put this off.

				Too expensive.





		12.	Hong Kong : Chinese Nationalist Aircraft.



P.M.	Don’t crate up aircraft &amp; send it back.  Let it rot, where it is.



A.L.B.	We have allowed ships to go, in past.



		Agreed :	we crate it, if they pay for its removal.





13.	Farm Price Review.



H.A.	Agreement can’t be obtained w’out ¾d. on milk &amp; 30/= on calves.

	But degrees of disagreement.  If we increase by £1½ M. and use it for small farmers (pigs, eggs &amp; calves) we cd. get N.F.U.’s to say tht. in view of economic circs. there is no disagreement on total figure only on end of individual guarantees &amp; settlement on milk &amp; pigs.

	This wd. have gt. political advantages.

	I strongly recommend we drop the 6d. redn. on pigs – tho’ saying this subsidy must be reduced in future.



H.M.	On Fri. p.m. H.A. told me that farmers wd. not settle w’out ¾ on milk.

	In form, of course, Govt. settle schedules after consultg. farmers.

	Wd. be easy to add £1½ M. – on pigs, eggs or calves (restricted to Steers).

	Public wd. think £24 M. a generous award in present circs.  Imposed settlement wd. help fr. that angle.

	If we offered the £1½ M., where do we put it?  On pigs, it mght cost us more – e.g. if nos. increased.  I wd. sooner therefore do it on calf subsidy, limited to steers.

	Turner clearly realises he can’t raise a big campaign v. £24 M.

	Had hoped, on procedure, we wd. avoid these last minute pressures.  I wd. prefer to stand pat.  When you’ve got a bully on the run, I wd. keep him on the run.



H.A.	Limited to steers, it wd. be less than £1 M.

	Wdn’t give us pol. help we shd. derive fr. w’drawing 6d. redn. on pigs.



H.M.	Pigs have come down by 3/6 and 2/6.  Another 6d. wd. show tht. our policy stands.  No redn. wd. suggest we have reached right price.



R.A.B.	Imposed settlement will mean some loss of prodn.

	Our county members wd. be easier on £25¼ M. – steers.



H.A.	Must get total to £25½ M. – grant on silage pits &amp; somethg. more.



		Agreed  :	£25¼ M.	H.M.  I’m worried.  Wd. like to

				  25.2 m.	consider it again.





14.	Aden Protectorate.



		Approved.
