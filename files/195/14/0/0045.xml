C.M.35(56)							10th May, 1956





		1.	North Atlantic Council.			[Enter E.H.



S.Ll.	Disorderly mtg.  D. had no suggns.  Robust support for Alliance Agreemt. tht. it cdn’t be used to channel econ. aid or action : but tht. its political side shd. be expanded.

	Parliamentarians.  Annual mtg.?  Last year’s mtg. was successful.



P.M.	No net addition to Assemblies.  Ad hoc mtgs. wd. be better.



H.M.	Merger of O.E.E.C. and Eur. Assembly.



P.M.	More M.P. visits to N.A.T.O. – or to NATO figures in other capitals.





		2.	Bahrain.



S.Ll.	Trouble likely around 16/5.  2 Cos. are there.  2 Frigates in Gulf.



P.M.	One of the frigates shd. show itself near Bahrain.

	Considerg. wtr R.N. shd. not assume full responsibility for Gulf, with Marines.  Easiest way.  Somethg. for R.N. to do.  Wd. avoid Army movements.



W.M.	Will discuss with C.O.S.  No. of tropicalised frigates.





3.	Parliament.



R.A.B.	Business for next week.				Whitsun Recess.

	14/5 : Supply : Cyprus &amp; Commr. Crabb.



P.M.	i)  Instns. were given [to Admy] tht. nothg. of this kind shd. be done.  That is reason for disciplinary action, wh. is now in train.

	ii) Tho’ it occurred on 19/4, no report made to Ministers until 4/5.

	iii) Admy. covered the man – with cover story that won’t hold water.



H.M.	Sympathy with P.M.’s posn. whose v. clear &amp; sound instructns. were disregarded.





4.	Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill.



R.A.B.	Courts martial : Colonial posn. : countries in which martial law is in operation appln. to Scotland.

	Suggest these ques. shd. be considered by Cab. on Tuesday – in prepn. for Cttee. Stage on Wedy.

	Cttee. Stage will not now be completed before Whitsun.





5.	Remuneration of Members.



R.A.B.	Opposn. are going to be generally obstructive in Parlt. because we are not going to deal with this.  Won’t be too bad.

	Our Party will welcome delay.

	Suggn. of enquiry will not be made until after Whitsun.  If we take a wholly negative line, we mayn’t be able to get Govt. business done. 

	Will wish to ask Cab. to consider that suggn. if &amp; when it is made.



L.P.	Disposed to stand pat &amp; do nothing.



R.A.B.	Junior Ministers – some can’t carry on much longer.



D.E.	Much is being done now for middle-classes : this mght be better time than later for getting Junior Ministers out of the way.





6.	Automation.



I.M.	No high-level enquiry.  No case for Sel. Cttee.  Suggest Cttee. of officials to see wtr our arrangem



		Draft of P.M.’s reply to P.Q. approved.





7.	Government Expenditure.



H.M.	Some progress is being made.

	Suggest mtg – P.M., H.M., RAB (civil) &amp; W.M. &amp; R.M. (defence) – to see where we stand.  Possibly before Whitsun.  Short memo.(?)

	Aim at an announcement by end/June.  All at once.  New Estimates if redns. are substantial.





8.	Wages and Prices.



H.M.	Amendment to para. 4 – to cover what we know is “in prospect”.

	Para. 5. “The Govt. sees no reason to expect any further increase in the c/l. this year, resulting fr. its own decisions.  Nor does it expect any increases above the level stated resulting fr. actions of the Boards of the natd. indies. unless of course there are further wage increases there”.



P.M.	Tactics : put it to T.U.C. in general terms.  Then I wd. announce it in speech Friday : having warned them that I will.



I.M.	What do we say to Press this p.m.?



R.A.B.	 Get R. Hall to attend &amp; advise on that.



H.M.	Prs. issue statement fr. No. 10. at same time as Perth speech, which will be Party occasion.



R.A.B.	Rent Act : £100 M. will both be unpopular.  Former will be 2 points.  Latter will have some effect.



H.M.	A/c. is taken of latter is taken in my Draft : the 2½ points increase.

	On Rent : we shd. say can’t face this distortion : but legn. is needed

x|	and it can’t bite for 12 months.  Doesn’t therefore affect this concept of a year’s standstill.



D.S.	In advance of that Bill, &amp; apart from it, rents are rising – partly because of redn. of subsidy.

But, if this is only 12 mos. p’mme, can we avoid saying x/.  Want to keep initiative over rents.



H.M.	More honest to be frank about it.



P.T.	Wage increases already granted may work thro’ in higher prices.	Agreed.

							add a phrase on that.



R.A.B.	Then brief communiqué this p.m. and “message” in P.M.’s speech.

	Avoid “briefing” of industrial correspondents.



							[Exit DS., E.H., A.J.



	9.	United States Aid to Pakistan.



P.T.	U.S. insist on 50% U.S. shipping.

	We have done 5m$ trade this way to Pakistan.  We now have chance of similar deal – only way of getting the business.  Germany, France etc., have accepted deals on this basis.  U.S. won’t drop 50% shipping condn.

	If we don’t take this, the trade will be snapped up by others.



H.W.	Depn. fr. shipping was promised we shd. do our best to resist the condn.  Wd. prefer tht. we shd. settle these, each ad hoc., none being a precedent.



P.M.	Cd. we raise with U.S., simultaneously, this &amp; the flag of

x|	convenience on wh. their interest is the same as ours.  The second is even more serious to our shipping.



L.P.	On balance, we shd. accept this.



A.L.B.	Finished textiles can go in Br. ships.



		Agreed : 	conclude this deal.

				F.O. to consider x/. in consultn. M/T.

								[Exit H.W.





	10.	East-West Trade.



S.Ll.	All we got in Paris was exceptions procedure on a few China items on condn. of re-instatement of embargo on copper wire.  Tho’ in return for latter they wd. consider some other relaxn. of Soviet list.

	This is unsatisf.  Shd. we resume discns. with U.S. or in Paris Cttee.  D. asked us to avoid open row before Elections.  Can we do anything m’while by exceptions.



P.T.	U.S. can’t, politically, help us in a review.

	Right course now is to use exceptions procedure.  Tell industry, U.S. &amp; Col. Govts. concerned.  Suggest we act unilaterally informg. afterwards – considering econ. interests, not of U.K. alone, but also of Colonies.  Operate on ‘gap’ between Soviet list &amp; China list.  Free licensing for rubber to China but try, if we can, to keep a/c of quantities sent.



A.L.B.	Malaya : largely psychological irritation.  Hong Kong : v. real difficulties.



P.T.	S.Ll. cd. say (P.Q.) we propose operate exceptions procedure.  B/T. will then answer further particular Ques.  Policy : aim to move twds. assimilation of R. &amp; Ch. lists.



S.Ll.	Inform U.S. before we tell Colonial Govts.



S.Ll.	Copper wire.  Have asked for joint military advice – U.K. &amp; U.S. soldiers take difft. view.  Also doubts on statistics.

	Cd. we restore it to watch list – so as to measure quantity?



P.T.	It is on that list now.  We can’t put a limit on it.  40.000 t. last year mght rise to 60.000 t.  U.S. consumptn. is 400.000 t.



S.Ll.	Cd. we say we won’t send more than 60,000 t. next year.



P.M.	Don’t give promise to limit : say it’s unlikely to go v. high : we’ll let them know how it goes etc.,



		F.O., with B/T. &amp; M/D., to concoct reply to U.S.



S.Ll.	Offer to review Soviet list.



P.M.	Don’t accept such an offer as condn. of agreement on copper wire.



P.T.	Quite unrealistic, in Election year, to negotiate this with U.S.





11.	Singapore.



ALB.	Have dropped “Independence”.  They agree to U.K. majority on Security Council.  But won’t admit power to intervene or control short of emergency.

	May break over week-end.

	Rumour that, save Marshall, all wd. accept (for difft. reasons) our plan.



L.P.	A &amp; N.Z. have offered public support.  But want to know in advance what our line (presentn.) will be.  It shd. be prepd. in outline now.



A.L.B.	Provisional draft available.  Final wd. depend on issue on which we break.





12.	Tariff Policy : G.A.T.T.



P.T.	Reported results of review.



H.M.	There will be comments re redn. of motor car tariffs.  Paper : large load on b/payments.



P.T.	£35 M. fr. all sources : but duty-free newsprint was £17 M.  The area over wh. we made concessions was quite small (Sweden) &amp;we got good quid pro quo on engineering goods, tyres. etc.,





13.	Flour.



R.A.B.	Propose to say we can’t publish any evidence, because given in confidence to Panel.



L.P.	This is evce. (incldg. M.R.C. evidence) wh. doesn’t conform to Cohen Report.  M.R.C. will be pressed to publish.  They will be free to do so.



H.A.	Sorry if they do : object was to stop controversy : this wd. revive it.



		Agreed : M/Ag. to submit memo.
