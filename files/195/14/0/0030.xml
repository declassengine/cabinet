C.M.20(56)							8th March, 1956





		1.	Parliament.					[Enter E.H., R.



R.A.B.	12/8 Debate on Cap. Punishment.

	Teachers (Superannuation) Bill : Report : has had to be p’poned, until follg. wk.

	14/3.  Cyprus.  Speakers : A.L.B. and P.M. (P.M. opening).

	15/3.  Service Suppl. Estimates.



P.M.	P’ponement of Teachers Bill is unfortunate because of controversy with teachers.



R.A.B.	But other business is inevitable.



H.M.	Budget : 17/4.  Better than 10/4, for we cd. take into a/c trade figures for March.



R.A.B.	Then we wd. have to take Monopolies Bill (Committee &amp; Rpt.) in 1st. week after Recess.  And catch up on Finance Bill later.



		Agreed : Announce next week date of 17/4.





		2.	Capital Punishment.



Ll.G.		Useful to announce, in 2nd. Rdg. debate, how many days wd. be

	x|	allowed for remaining stages.

	Don’t propose to give drafting help with amendments – by “opponents”.



P.M.	Did I not promise “technical” help – on 23/2.



Ll.G.	That wd. be met by getting Bill into proper shape before it goes to H/Lds.



R.A.B.	Most abolitionists will support Bill : looks as tho’ it will pass with lesser majority.

	Are Ministers to be free to abstain on this Bill?

	In Cttee. strong case for Govt. taking over or at least [making it clear we won’t have wrecking amendments.]  Otherwise it will encroach too much on our p’mme of legn.

	If we must bow to abolitionists, do it quickly.



S.	But Bill will be defeated in H/L.  Better therefore for Govt. to take as little responsibility for it in H/C. as possible.

	My own view, v. narrowly, favours retention.  I wd. say that in H/L., but allow completely free vote.

	Wd. be consistent with that if Govt. left this freely to H/C.



K.	Yes : Govt. in H/C. shd. not go beyond [  ].



Ll.G.	Serious amendments – e.g. exemptg. murders of warders &amp; police.  Also N.I. Govt., who think it their business, want to be exempt fr. Bill.



K.	Our good faith shdn’t be impugned  : we shdn’t be thght to have countenanced wrecking amendments.  Ques turns on what is a wreckg. amendment.



S.	Ques of conscience – but on both sides.



B.H.	It is for Chair to decide what is wreckg. amendment – for it shd. not be called.



E.H.	x/ wd. be a mistake.  Wd. invite delaying amendments.

	Bill will pass unless Labour M.P.’s abstain.

	Apart from merits – this Bill has become pol. embarrassmt. to Govt.  If this were made plain by Ministers voting unitedly against it, some abolitionists on our side wd. come round &amp; vote v. it.



R.A.B.	Want Ll.G. in Cttee. to indicate tht. we mean to get this Bill out of the way.  We must therefore see that it’s business-like procdg.



H.A.	I favour abolition, but not because of conscience.  I am re-considerg. my position.  I may be able to vote v. the Bill.



A.L.B.	Bill cd. not be extended to Colonies – we shd. have to resist that., win with Whips if necessary.

							[Enter B.C.



3.	Cost of Living.



I.M.	Final &amp; more accurate index.  Introduce this month (announce 13/3) : with Jan. as 100.

	Particular problem : what to do re those excluded viz., those over £1.000 p.a. and those at lowest income level on Nat. Assistce.

	Don’t want a separate index.  Wd. be used as convenient by those seekg. more money.  We can resist it because never supposed new index wd. extend to these classes.  cf. Rpt. of Adv. Cttee. para. 4. referring to a date when Labour were in office.



B.C.	New index excludes those on lowest incomes, expressly.  But admits tht. we have material on wh. we cd. construct a separate index for them.  We shall be accused of suppressing this because inconvenient to us.

	Unofficial pensioners’ index will be calculated and used.

	Cd. we reserve decn. on this until we see what pressure there is for it.



H.M.	Support M/L. view.  Resist this for as long as possible.



I.M.	Can say N.A.Bd. keep their own records for this purpose, but we don’t propose to publish official figure.



H.A.	N. Food Survey gives separate informn. about pensioners.



P.M.	N.A.Bd. can publish their figures, if they like.



H.M.	No : allow them to use them as basis for recommns.



I.M.	Admit there will be pressure, but can resist it for a time.



RAB.	Support M/L. view.  But need he make so full a statement?



P.M.	Yes.  Tho’ verbal slimming may be applied.



		Memo. by M/L. approved.





		4.	War Pensions.



	1)	General Rate.



B.C.	Don’t press this claim, in economic circs.  Shall reject it.  But there will be complaints.



	2)	Limbless Cases.



H’to no medical case for saying tht. disabled are at greater disadvantage as they grow older.

Now Mac(!) has said there is.  And Russel Brain agrees with him.



H.M.	Para. 13 – avoid phrases which imply tht. we shd. be more generously inclined in 6 months or so.



B.C.	Will consult H.M. on this – drafting.



H.M.	On point 2) have we set this in hand thro’ M.R.C.?  Will cost £400.000 if they advise in favour.



S.	The M.R.C. haven’t yet agreed to take it on.  It’s a pretty political issue for them.



	

5.	Volta River Project.



P.T.	If we decide to go on, Govt. machinery for aiding it will need to be

y|	reviewed.  B/T. can’t do it in off moments.

	Nature &amp; extent of cost.

	Advantages – doubtful.  Shortfall of aluminium in 1965 wd. be anticipated by the cos.  We cd. do better by increased investment in Canada.  The case for this is dollar-saving : Commonwealth development.

	Para. 9. sets out alternatives.  I don’t think U.K. wd. now be justified in puttg. nearly so much investment into this.  Suggest therefore we try to interest W. Bank, w’out commitg. ourselves to our contn.  C.O. wd. tell 

x|	Gold Coast Govt, &amp; I wd. tell companies.



ALB.	Support P.T.’s memo.  Can’t draw out of this, but we must adjust our financial stake in it.  W’drawal of Br. officers fr. G. Coast will make this scheme more diff. to carry thro’.



P.M.	Will companies go on, with pol. uncertainties in G. Coast?



A.L.B.	It is a useful restraing. influence on G. Coast politicians.



H.	It is only one of a no. of Comm. projects.  It wd. have to come out of £60 M. contn. to Bank.



H.M.	No : it wd. come out of Bank’s resources as a whole.

	Share B/T. fears.  But Canadian Co. have guaranteed to take the power.  But, direct or thro’ sums raised on Ldn. market, we cdn’t contribute as much as planned.

	Experts are due to confer in Apl.  We must therefore warn G. Coast before then tht. our fin. contn. will have to be limited, as at x/. on lines of para. 9.

	Will submit to Cab. my proposal for our maximum contn., before these talks begin.



P.T.	On y/ I wd. like to discuss with H.M. changes in Govt. machinery – both Ministerial responsibility and official machinery.



R.A.B.	Avoid pessimism in Canadian Aluminium Co., which wd. affect Black’s attitude.



		Agreed :  memo. appd.



			N.B. to consult H.M., ALB &amp; P.T. on y/.



D.E.	Beware of international tender if Bank were in.  We mght be worse off with lower contn. but no contracts.



		Commn. to G. Coast Govt &amp;             ) to be concerted by A.L.B.

			     Alum. Cos.                       ) P.T. &amp; H.M.





6.	Gold Coast Constitution.



A.L.B.	Later events i)	N. Liberation Movemt. have declined to join confce.

			ii)  Nkruma is hedging on Genl. Election – wh. he says cd. not be conducted w’out intimidation or bloodshed.

	Govr. thinks it wd. be no worse than usual.  He advises tht. we insist on Election.



		Memo. approved.

							[Enter Att.G.



7.	South West Africa.



H.	Shd. we intervene?  S.A. Govt. won’t because they dispute right of U.N. to exercise any jurisdn.  Only real case for doing so is to avoid interference with non-self-governing countries.



Att.G.	We think we cd. make a good case : esp. tht. S.W. Afr. is special case.  But have now seen U.S. case.  They will argue tht. as S.A. won’t give informn. wh. wd. have bn. given to Mandates Commn., U.N. are entitled to use other means of ascertaing. what is going on.  We wdn’t oppose that argument.  And if it won the day decision wdn’t affect dependent territories.

	We cd. therefore go with watchg. brief.  To argue the diffce. betwn. S.W. Africa &amp; dependent territories.  So tht. in future we cd. say tht. S.W.A. is sui generis.



		Agreed :  U.K. to attend with watching brief.

									[Exit Att.G.

[Enter Str.

		8.	Cost of Meat Inspection.				



H.M.	Scotl. wh. is net exporter, has carried cost w’out Exch. grant.

	I am most anxious not to add new specific grants to l.a.’s.

	If this were conceded, cdn’t hold the line v. other claims.

	Let l.a.’s pay : if they gain on equalisation, they add it to their claims on that fund.

	Wd. be unwise to put this on industry, esp. as Scotland intend to m’tain it as a l.a. charge.

	This wd. be mistake esp. when l.G. finance is about to be reviewed.



H.A.	L.a.’s aren’t doing work properly.  If no Ty. grant, may have to be transferred to trade.  When big slaughter-house in small l.a. area, mght be as much as 5d. in £ on rates.



R.A.B.	H.A. Cttee. were unanimous v. Ty. on this.

	There will be a row if we take Ty. line.

	Hostility fr. N.F.U.’s, followg. price review : and fr. l.a.’s followg. re-valuation for rating.

	Pol. expediency v. financial scruple.



H.M.	Why can Sc. do it locally.

	To RAB my reply is : et tu Brute.

	But, on basis of para. 5 of CP69 &amp; with reference to l.g. fin. review, I will bow to majority view.





9.	Iceland Fisheries Dispute.



P.M.	Cd. Secy. Genl., O.E.C.C. be asked to apply pressure to Iceland Govt.



P.T.	Wish trawler cos. wd. refrain fr. emphasising restrictive	Agreed.

	character of agreemt.?



H.A.	Will continue to counsel caution on this.			Agreed.



							[Re-enter E.H.



		10.	Farm Price Review.



H.A.	N.F.U.’s are now angling for agreed settlement at £29.5 M.

	Believe they wd. come down even lower, e.g. £27 M.



P.M.	V. reluctant to re-open prices of pigs &amp; milk.



H.A.	I wdn’t go higher than ⅝d. on milk.

	Pigs : much uncertainty among producers.

	If we had to meet N.F.U.’s I wd. go to £27 M. with adjustments on these viz., no cut in pigs and another ⅛d. on milk.

	The suggn. of £1 for small men implies silage subsidy this year.



P.M.	With public opinion as it is, will N.F.U.’s dare to oppose offer of £24 M.



R.A.B.	Cd. get agreement by x/.  But economically unsound.  N.F.U.’s will say how near to agreement we were : and rural areas will not therefore be excited unduly.

	I favour standing on £24 M. decision.



H.M.	Believe they won’t attack imposed settlement at £24 M. – esp. when their figure was only £29 M.  Esp. also, as agric. wage claim has bn. refused.  This may be turning point.  Advantages of a Govt. decision on this.



I.M.	I agree – it wd. be helpful qua wages if Govt. declined to do more than £24 M.



H.A.	I accept this decision.  Doubt if N.F.U.’s will accept – but much less heat in this than in earlier years.



R.A.B.	They will attack w’drawal of individual guarantees.

	Cd. we not add to W. Paper para. promising discns. on long-term stability.



H.A.	Para. 33 is all Ty. want on this.



H.M,.	Cd. link it with silage.		Agreed :  seek a formula on this.



	

11.	International Wheat Agreement.



		Note taken.
