C.M.33(55)							22nd September, 1955





		1.	National Service.		[Enter B-H., 3 Serv. Ministers., 							CIGS., C.N.S.



		Whole-time Service.



S.Ll.	Not because of econ. crisis.  On present plans def. exp’re wd. rise to unmanageable heights.  Decided therefore that size of Forces must be reduced.  Ques of means only.  Choice lies between e) and f).  On grds. of mil. efficiency I must recommend e) – smaller no. of men for 24 months.  Tho’ redn. to 21 mos. wd. not be disastrous.



W.M.	Advantage of later age – enables men to get job before Service.  In ’38 on merits age favoured was 21.

	Grade III proposal.  Wd. have to take doctors &amp; dentists.  Services wd. be criticised for not taking men who cd. be used.



A.H.	This is 1st. step twds. abolition, progressively : our action will therefore commit us to method.  Don’t want to be committed to tapering off by progressive redn. of period.  For object of N.S. now (not at outset) is to provide men for active Army, not trained reserves.

	Goodwill of Army has bn. strained &amp; burden on shrinking no. of regulars.  We shd. stop this drain &amp; increase regular content.  Redn. in time of service inefficient : reduces value of N.S. men : wd. make 3 year contract less popular : adds greater strain to regular cadres. 

	Practice of other N.A.T.O. countries irrelevant, for none but French have comparable overseas commitments.

	Redn. of 3 mos. will be ridiculed by T.U. and Opposn. – and criticised by our supporters as inefficient.  



de L.	Support A.H. – esp. on efficiency argument.  Regular R.A.F. wd. be more efficient &amp;that must be our long-term aim.  Long period of training of N.S. men is essential.  We need those men.



J.T.	Such N.S. men as we use are more use if held for 2 years.  Support A.H. &amp; de L.



C.I.G.S.	Support arguments on efficiency.

	We can reduce to nos. suggd. by M/D.  But can’t do our job then w’out efficient forces.

	Was C-in-C., F/E., when period was raised : effect on efficiency was v. marked.  Achievements in Korea, Malaya etc., cd. not have bn. possible with service below 24 mos.



P.M.		i)  Shd. retain elasticity.  Intern. scene is not set fair &amp; cd. cloud over

	again.  We must be able to re-adjust w’out upheaval.

		ii)  Wd. be desirable to present them as 1st. step in a 3 or 4 yr. p’mme. 



D.E.	Opinion:  gap betwn. leaving school &amp; call-up is period of tendency twds. delinquency.  This wd. widen that gap.  Wd. like discuss with M/L.  wtr we can say we recognise tht. this is dangerous period &amp; we have means of combating the risks.



R.A.B.	More weight in e) than f).  If (f) cd. be combined with some forecast of future policy, we shd. get more credit than for a simple redn. of 3 months.

	Tho we so decide, let us not forget that 2 yrs. is a big slice out of a young man’s life.

	Para. 21 of memo.  Imposs. to concede that this autumn .  Will have to do it in due course, but can’t be committed now.  No proposals have bn. put to Ty.  Prefer to have it dealt with over 3 to 6 mos.



S.Ll.	Agree it will take that sort of time.  Only wanted a decln. tht. we are going to do it.



R.A.B.	Regret premature disclosures to Press on such ques.  Articles in Express foreshadowing pay increases in R.A.F.



Sal.	Agree with R.A.B. 24 mos. is easier to defend than 21.  If smaller forces, we must have most efficient forces we can.  Inefficiency is extravagance.

	Politically, diffce. betwn. 24 &amp; 21 is not sufficiently attractive.

	Gap – delinquency etc.,  Argument of M/L. prevails over M/E.

	Para 14(d).  Such applns. shd. be granted, automatically.  E.g.  University undergraduate.  



W.M.  	We do grant such applns.



H.C.	Efficiency argument prevails.  



D.E. 	Agree.



J.S.	No pol. advantage in 21 mos.  Can Services keep them employed?



H.A.	Service arguments are conclusive.       ..          ..             ..         ..     Persuade industry to treat 14-18 yr. olds as beginners in a career rather than filling in a gap.



W.M.	We are doing that &amp; big firms are playing up to it.



		Agreed:  W.M. &amp; D.E. to discus this aspect.



Ll.G.	Efficiency argument carries the day.  



A.L.B.  	Agree.



H.M.	From F.O. angle, 24 mos. is preferable – a great help in reln.  to NATO Allies.

	On numbers, can’t yet be said how we can hope to discharge our commitments.  Needs further study.  Shall have to consult or inform U.S. &amp; Allies if this redn. shd. affect our capacity to meet those commitments.  Easier, even so, if period rests at 24 mos.

	Before Election I told Party it wd. be madness to reduce period because of risk of competitive bidding.  But : N.S. accepted as training scheme : we must admit tht. it is not now needed for that, but for active service in peace : a v. diff. political proposn.  Shall we in the end be able to defend this – on basis tht. we aren’t ready to pay enough to attract suff. people into regular Forces.



W.	Services case is convincing.  Redn. to 21 wd. provoke demands for redn. to 18 &amp; we shd. not have argument of efficiency to w’stand it.



K.	Agree.  But if advanced on efficiency, Services are acceptg. oblign. to rebut criticisms of waste of time.



P.T.	Agreed.



J.P.	Agree.  On statement.  Is our objective to abolish N.S.?  Hope not.

	I believe it is valuable to citizenship – tho’ cost to economy must be weighed v. that.



P.M.	Endorse this conclusion.

	But	i)   H.M.’s point must be kept in mind.

	ii)  Point of a redn.  to 21 mos. wd. be indicn. of instalment. That mght avert strong pressure for larger reduction.  

iii) Service pay.  What I wd. like to see, eventually, is small regular Forces : esp. in view of technical specialisn.  Only approach to it = better condns. of service.

iv)  Internatl. aspects.  Don’t want any suggn. now of modifying our Treaty obligns.  Wd. sooner take the knock on strategic reserves than on B.A.O.R.

v)   Course (e) will have to be announced in a statement foreshadowg. future policy.  

Reluctant to link this with economic statement.  Must avoid impn. tht. it is done for econ. reasons.  Wd. sooner link it with disarmament.  We can do it at our convenience – w’out waiting for Parlt.  Mght be related to Bulganin’s message

	Draft statement will be submitted to Cabinet.



		Agreed :  {Adopt course (e).

			    {No consequential work before announcement.



		Part-time Service.



CIGS.	Army cd. accept one camp &amp; no drills.  Present proposal designed merely to make Army oblign. comparable to that of Mobile Defence Corps.



S.Ll.	“X drills”.  I was thinking of 24 p.a. – equivalent of 4 days.



P.M.	Let us discuss in Def. Cttee., with object of relieving oblign. to full extent consistent with needs of Mobile Def. Corps.



		Agriculture.



W.M.	Want to make some concession w’out a breach of principle of universality.

	To restore “blanket” wd. cause criticism qua agriculture; and wd. also be v. diff because of repercussions – claims for other indies.

	We cdn’t hold the posn.



H.A.	Drop in labour force is now becomg. serious.  1953 : 6,000.  1954 : 12.000.  1955 : 23.500.  Out of 500,000 employees.  Only about 50% return to agric. after N.S.

	N.U.’s concerned.  T.U.’s not – because they prefer shortage of labour.  Support memo. of M/L.



Sal.	Scientists etc., resisted because of universality rule.  Surely they are more important than nos. in agriculture.



W.M.	This will yield 2.500 p.a.



A.L.B.	Proposal (a) is not a new principle.



		Agreed  :	Accept this in principle.

				No announcemt. before genl. decn. is announced.

				Look again at genl. ques of exemptions.





		2.	Economic Situation.			[Exit Serv. Min., C.O.S.



R.A.B.	Choice betwn. i)  creatg. or increasg. crisis atmosphere.

			ii) preserving initiative.

	Read prepared statement.

	Reserves are recovering, at present because of improvement in Europe. May not be more than $130 m. loss.

	Risks of waiting. At worst, run on reserves.  At best, posn. will be worse in Oct. than now.

	B/E. don’t advise announcemt. of autumn Budget or recall of Parlt. before announcement, or soon after, of Sept. figures.  If we are not to act, B/E. wd. prefer to see it played down.

	Diff. : but I wd. prefer to have said somethg. before end/Sept. – eg. that our plan will be disclosed to Parlt., wh. will meet for that purpose a week earlier than planned.  Before publn. of Sept. figures.



P.T.	Unwise to risk delay.  3 wks. of speculn. : 2 Party Conferences, at which issues wd. have to be fluffed.



D.E.	I also favour early action.  For both Confces. will suggest economies &amp; Govt. will lose initiative.

	Figures will show change of trend.



P.M.	Grave effect on Govt.’s credit if Parlt. is recalled – confidence of our public will be shaken.  Opposn. wd. gloat over it.  If therefore it is avoidable, we shd. avoid it.



W.M.	Decision Thurs. for recall Tues. will look like panic.



S.Ll.	Measures we envisage are not immediate in effect : less reason on that a/c for urgent recall of Parlt.



A.L.B.	I agree.



O.P.	No sudden catastrophe can occur in next 3 wks – only a gradual worsening of posn. of our reserves.



W.	Public have confidence in Govt.  Abroad, there is more confidence in Govt. since RAB.’s statement at Istanbul.  Panic action now mght provoke a run on sterling : &amp; will lead people here to expect more drastic &amp; immedte. action than we intend.

	Prefer therefore to take this quietly.  Fear “dramatic” action.



Sal.	Endorse that view.  Decn. to recall wd. create panic.



J.S.	Share that view.



Agreed :	Announce from No. 10 before end/Sept.  decision to recall Parlt. 8 days earlier than planned.



								[Enter S.G.

	3.	Parliament : Re-distribution of Seats.



Ll.G.	No major legn. needed.

	But i)  reviews need not be so frequent.

	      ii)  numerical equality shd. not be too rigidly pressed.



S.G.	Diffces. betwn. Att.G. &amp; H.O. are v. technical.  Cd. Att.G. discuss with Ll.G.



Ll.G.	I can settle these outside.  



P.M.  	Pl. do.



		Agreed :	Try to formulate legve. proposals.

				Consult Opposn. parties.



								[Exit Sol.Genl.

		4.	United States Fruit.



A.L.B.	If agreemt. on period, I assent – subject to consultn. with W.Indies.

	But on canned grape-fruit, I feel that we cd. refuse to take any – this year – because it is U.S. law which prevents implemn. of agreemt.  Tho’ Manley may think tht. we cd. take a little, because of need to preserve good relns. with U.S.  If so, we cd. do so.



P.T.	Pre-war 14.000 t. of imports, mainly fr. U.S.  Since war, we have bought none fr. U.S., to protect Col.  Present proposal wd. give 75% protn. to Colonies.  A.L.B. is askg. for 100%.  If we go as far as that, we shd. have a worse case than they have on Ch. Joseph Dam.

	Prs. we had better p’pone decision until Manley comes, as he will be here so soon.



A.L.B.	We have requd. W.Indies to grow this in order to diversify economy.



R.A.B.	A complete ban wd. enflame our relns. with U.S. &amp; wd. end Manley’s relns. with Florida too.  Surely, we must take a little.  Tho’ I agree tht. we shd. not decide or tell U.S. until we have talked to Manley.



P.M.	Tell W.Indies what we propose on fresh, but that we are reaching no decn. on canned until he comes &amp; can discuss.



								[Exit Sal. &amp; J.S.



5.	E/West Trade : Strategic Controls.



S.Ll.	If Cab. accept new basis, Ministers concerned cd. work out a new embargo list – for discn. with U.S., Fr. &amp; others.



A.L.B.	China too?



P.M.	Not at this stage.



		Agreed.





		6.	Arms for M/East : Supply of French Aircraft to Israel.



H.M.	Staging facilities in Cyprus for Myster fighters.

	Idea of general ban has failed : U.S. &amp; Fr. won’t agree.

	On balance, my view is tht. our vested interests in staging facilities shd. prevail.



P.M.	Allow the facilities – after delaying reply for as long as possible.



		H.M. and S.Ll. to settle between them.
