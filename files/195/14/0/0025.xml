RAB.	Mon/Tues. Economic debate.  On Govt. motion, inviting H/C. to express confidence in measures proposed.  Shall see Opposn. Leader to-day &amp; tell him H.M. will make statement to-morrow.  If he presses for it to be made to-day, we may have to agree to doing it.

P.T.	Govt. spokesmen in debate.			[Enter R.M., C., B.C.



R.A.B.	H.M. on 1st. day : P.T. and [P.M.] on 2nd. day.  I.M. is a possibility : or a Ty. Junior Minister : or P.T.



P.M.	I may have to wind up if there is a big row.  Prob.ly will be enough to have Boyle + P.T. on second day.  I.M. to be present on 2nd. day &amp; ready to speak vice Boyle if need arises.



E.H.	Mon.  Loyal Address welcoming Queen on her return.  

* C.O. to send brief to P.M.



H.M.	Investment allowances.  Can new projects in shipping be exempted?  Proposed to make project, not placing of constituent contracts, the test.  I wd., however, be ready to move ship-bldg. into 3rd. category &amp; exempt it wholly, as will be done for scientific research projects.



H.A.	1) improvement of farm bldgs  2) improvement of workers’ cottages.  Wd. have liked concessions on these.

	Also Members’ Fund – on which they will produce hard cases.  Think this can be met by Ty. contribn. to the Fund.



P.M.	Govt. supporters wdn’t tolerate increase in pay.

	What of extending allowance to Friday attendance – cost £1280 only.



H.M.	May have to do that – in order to get agreemt. to increase of Junior Ministers’ salaries.  Perhaps in June/July.



RAB.	Oppn. priorities are i) M.P.’s pay  ii) Allowances for H/Lds.  iii) Junior Ministers’ salaries.

		5.	Widows’ Pensions.



B.C.	No one with authority to commit Govt. made any commitment.  But general impn. was left that this wd. be dealt with.

	Govt. supporters show some anxiety to be protected fr. pressure wh. is developing from the widows, who are becomg. more organised.

14 days – near end/month.

P.M.	Visit to Windsor.  Normal practice is for visiting P.M.’s to be given lunch if they go to Windsor.

	W.S.C. is against this.



S.Ll.	My instinct is against it, too.



		General view of Cabinet : Queen shd. ask them to stay to tea.

		visit being put forward to afternoon : if Queen is not snarled up 	with Boy Scouts.



P.M.	Shd. Opposn. be allowed to give them a dinner?  Proposed for Monday.
