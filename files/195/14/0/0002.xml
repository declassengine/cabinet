C.M. 21(55)								7th July, 1955



									[Enter B.H.

		1.	Cyprus.



		(a).	Visit by S. of S.



A.L.B.	Wish to visit – to support morale, not for discns. in advance of conference.  Intend to go this week-end.



P.M.	Let it be known purposes are not related to conference – e.g. developmt. plans, for which he had planned to visit Cyprus earlier.



H.M.		Are you, or are you not, going to see local leaders?



A.L.B.	Have sought Govr’s view on this.  I wdn’t exclude possibility of seeing Archbishop on neutral ground.



H.M.	Don’t increase his power – doubt if Gks. are pleased with him.

	Tho’ don’t snub him if Govr. makes conv. opportunity to meet him &amp; he comes to Govt. House.



H.M.		Greek acceptance is satisf.



A.E.		Except denial that Turks are concerned at all with Cyprus.



H.M.	But, in press releases, Gks. admit T. concern with minorities.  It’s on Treaties, they say, T. are excluded.



P.M.		Not impn. I go from telegram.



A.L.B.	I wd. be disposed to see Archbishop only if he asks to see me.  

Wd. announce tht. I was going, not for constitl. matters, but for developmt. plan : and decline to discuss constitl. ques.



P.M.		Then they will complain : they are excluded fr. conference.



A.L.B.	But they can talk to Govr. – invitation remains open.

	Better prs. announcement what I am going for, not mention the negative.  Say for “economic development and adminve. ques”.



H.C.	No one will believe it’s for those purposes – given announcemt. of conference.



A.L.B.	Want to talk to Govr. re EOKA – as well as boost morale.

	New law can be deferred until 12 or 13 July – after my visit.  Want to discuss with him wtr it is still necessary.

	I cd. say tht. therefore longer tour starting 23/7 this is my only opportunity to visit Cyprus.



P.M.	If you go, you must see Archb. if [he offers] a reasonable way of meeting can be arranged.



H.M.	Say you were going for discn. with Govr. &amp; Ex. Council Econ. developmt.





	(b).	Emergency Law.



A.L.B.	W’spread evce. of conspiracy.  Some arrested.  Some may not be convicted because disclosure of sources of informn.  Need for special powers to detain them.  Don’t want a decln. of “emergency”.  Suggested instead a special law, limited to this one purpose.  Govr. has accepted this suggn.  I will suggest some improvemts in his scheme.

	Now less urgent because those in custody are likely to be remanded to 12 or 13/7.

	Hope Cab. will authorise this if I’m satisfied tht. there is evce. in support of belief tht. there is conspiracy to murder.

	10 arrested : Govr. wants to arrest 40 more.

	This is aimed at terrorism, not Enosis.



P.M.	Total of 50 is a little disturbing.



H.M.	When law is introduced, I will inform Gk. Govr. – giving reasons, viz., we must m’tain law and order.



P.M.	A.L.B. shd. form view wtr this is necessary now situation is calmer.



K.	Is there already power to arrest for possn. of arms or explosives?



ALB.	Yes.  It is organisers they now want to arrest.  But I do want to satisfy myself on need and on timing.



P.M.	Hope Govr. will realise posn. has bn. changed by acceptce. of G &amp; T. to come to conference.



		Bring up again at Tuesday’s Cabinet.

		We shd. aim at avoiding this action at present time.



K.	Cd. Govr. not at least omit refce. to “overthrowing constitn.” and rely on “force or violence”.  Easier to defend if limited to violence &amp; not extending to revolutionary propaganda.

								[Enter G.Ll.



	2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Coal Prices.  Shd. G.Ll. tell 1922 Cttee.?



G.Ll.	Have expld. to F &amp; Power Cttee.  It went reasonably well.  Is it necessary to tell 1922 Ctteeee. as well?  I favour it : to give a lead to Party as a whole.  Prices go up to-morrow.  Debate is likely in week after next.



		Agreed : unnecessary.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Debate on Monopolies : 13/7.



Try for general debate non-committal in character.  On motion talking note of Rpt.



P.T.	It shd. be on our motion. We shd. open.

	Posn. isn’t easy.  Party, w’out lead, is divided.

	Two courses a)	Give them a lead &amp; aim at unity

	b)	Say it’s complicated &amp; we haven’t made up our minds.

	If we follow b) a united Oppn. will seize initiative, &amp; keep it, on monopolies.

	Propose therefore to tell Trade &amp; Industry Grp. on Tues. what our line is.  expediency demands tht. we take a course between majority &amp; minority reports.  And I believe that is best course on merits.



P.M.	Circulate before week-end summary of your line &amp; let us consider at Tuesday’s Cabinet.



R.A.B.	Is it as easy as this?  Re-sale price m’tenance is v. difficult.  Believe we may have to fall back on b).



K.	Cd. we not get more time – even a week would help.



H.C.	Oppn. wdn’t accept delay.



P.T.	Confident I can get 90% of T. &amp; I Group behind a Govt. line, by Wedy.  Will consult some colleagues before week-end.  Can devise a motion which Party will support.



P.T.	We must lead off.  Must therefore be our day.



B.H.	I can try Oppn. with firm promise of debate a week later	} Agreed.

	If that fails, announce debate on 13/7 on Govt. motion 	}



H.C.	Adjourn 28/7.		[Exit G.Ll.





	3.	Foreign Affairs.



H.M.	Conference with G &amp; T.  M/D. and M/State, Colonies.  Mid/August.



	Saar Agreement.  Risk that Saar people may throw it out.  Apptmt. of Commr.  Propose to keep out of this (suggesting a name) until referendum is through.



P.M.	Warn Germans of risk.  No nonsense over this.



H.M.	I will suggest that to H Millar.



	Council of Europe.



H.M.	Minor Europeans showg. signs of weakness because of change in R. attitude.  I put in a word of caution v. throwg. away our defences.

	R. peace propaganda is a bit dangerous.



P.M.	NATO., Anglo/U.S. friendship, German unity : these are the 3 things we don’t give up.  Wise to nail these before going into Mtg.  

	Some people in U.K. may think this too stiff.



								[Enter B.C.

	4.	Road Haulage Disposals.



B.C.	As in memo.



RAB.	Don’t put up S. 4 again.



A.L.B.	Support that.  If we stopped all sales, w’out warning, we shd. be open to criticism tht. small men wd. have come along if they had known.  Doubts : a) F.B.I. case is strong.

		b) People have bought in belief tht. they wd. not have competn. from B.T.C.

	But compromise betwn. d) and e) in memo. is best course.



J.S.	Can we give an assurance on b)?



P.T.	They can’t expect to escape competn.  They wd. have faced competn. fr. trunk services in private hands.



K.	Agree.



D.E.	Not worried on that.  B.T.C. competn. is less of a threat because less competent!



W.M.	Small packets unpopular with Unions therefore more diff. to organise workers.



B.C.	There shd. be discns. with Party and with outside interests.  Diff. to complete these before debate next week.  Will stall in debate.  Will send RAB &amp; H.C. a note of what I would propose to say – indicatg. a line we are likely to follow.  Some of debate will be on rlways.

	Authorised announcement before end/July.  Text to be submitted to P.M.

								[Enter J.T., Att.G



	5.	Admiral Hughes-Hallett.



K.	No ques of raising rate of pension.  Ques of damages v. Onslow.

i)	Was he in fiduciary posn.  I don’t believe he was.  Don’t think claim wd. succeed on that point.

ii)	Cd. he have w’drawn candidature?  Yes – tho’ with some political loss.  He cd. therefore have minimised his damage.

iii)	He complains of losing in pension an annual sum much less than his Parly. remuneration in a v. safe Cons. seat.

	Not therefore much of a claim.

	I advise we contest the action. If it looks worse when pleadings are complete, we can pay into court with denial of liability or consider going to arbitn.  We needn’t decide that now.  If we allow action to be opened, we shall avoid suggn. of appearing to try to hush it up.



J.T.	Dislike prospect of Onslow’s being dragged thro’ the courts.



W.M.	Support K’s conclusion.



Att.G.	I agree tht.  Adml. wdn’t succeed short of H/Lords.



		Agree : let him go to law, if he will.

								[Exit J.T., Att.G.



	6.	Housing Subsidies.



R.A.B.	L.a’s are going from market to P.W.L. Bd.  We must raise rate.  And next week.

	Subsidy ques must come up later for Cab. decn.



D.S.	What do I say in reply to P.Q.’s which will be asked at once – will housing subsidy be raised in consequence?  Wd. wish, in reply, to begin to prepare ground for reduction.  E.g. to indicate tht. whole ques is under review.  Wd. stimulate public discn. which wd. be helpful.



J.S.	Useful for l.a.’s to realise tht. P.W.L. rates can vary w’out consequential changes in subsidies.



D.S.	Shall need to discuss with l.a. assocns.  Want therefore to indicate tht. there is review procdg.

	Reduction will be only on new houses.  Change will be gradual.  Tho’ political diffies. are considerable.



R.A.B.	Say that it is always under review.



D.S.	Will submit memo. – for Thursday next.



H.M.	Strike note of re-direction vice reduction.



D.S.	Diff. because no increase on any part of field.
