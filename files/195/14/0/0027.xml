C.M.17(56)							28th February, 1956





		1.	S.E.A. Treaty Organisation.	[Enter E.H., Hare, Brooke., 4							  	C.O.S



S.H.	Effect of publicity, not only on neutrals, but on countries (eg. Malaya) where we hope to get bases – they wd. fear reprisals.



	Cd. we not say we shall use such force as may be necessary – to match gravity of the attack.



P.M.	No security – eg. Bankok.



W.D.	Communiqué can be carefully worded – as it was in N.A.T.O.  But the discn. must cover nuclear weapons because they are mentioned in planners’ report wh. has bn. circulated and is on agenda.



J.H.	Support S.H.’s view on Malaya.



P.M.	Take S.H.’s line, and agree it with U.S. in advance.



H.	Also agree with Dulles what he shd. say to Nehru when he goes on to Delhi.

									[Exit H.



		2.	Buraimi.



S.Ll.	Exclude cession of territory.  Transit facilities wd. be a safe concession.  Ques is wtr we shd., if necessary, offer a neutral zone.  We shd. go no further.



W.M.	What effect on friendly sheikhs?



S.Ll.	It has gone well in Kuwait.



P.M.	I wdn’t be inclined to go beyond (a).  But if Burrows thinks (b) is safe, by reason of Kuwait, you may recommend it to us by telegram.



H.B.	Any ques of compensn. under (a)?



S.Ll.	We have done the local ruler v. well : no request for compensn. need be entertained.



S.	Hope you won’t go beyond (a).  (b) might be thght to imply there is somethg. in Saudi’s case.

 

		Agreed  :	S.Ll. not to go beyond (a) w’out further 				reference to Cabinet.





		3.	Jordan.

	

P.M.	a)  Glubb has asked for a Minister to attend Arab Legion Parade.

	S of S. for Air may go – subject to prior verification that King &amp; Govt. are agreeable.  Message to the King.

								Agreed.



S.Ll.	b)  Israelis may try to bounce me into visiting Jerusalem in a way implying our recognition of it as Israel’s capital.  I shall decline to meet Ben Gurion formally  in Jerusalem, tho’ I will dine there informally.

	All our Allies are at one in declining official recognition of Jerusalem.

								Agreed.



P.M.	c)  I like line suggd.  in Amman 255.

	We must avoid being dragged in by Syria by the back door.

	Duke puts it more crisply than F.O. draft.



S.Ll.	It’s general principle : are we bound by Treaty to aid J. if I. attacked by S.

	Not.  But we are by Tripartite Decln.



R.A.B.	By Treaty we wd. be at war : by Decln. we say “assist” by troops – wd. that not be war.  Is there a real distinction?



S.Ll.	On attack on J., we shd. be at war at once.  On indirect attack via another Arab State, we have first to consult our Allies under Decln.



P.M.	But we are consultg. now thro’ staffs.  We shd. all have to be ready to act at once.



S.Ll.	We haven’t said “at war” in reln. to Decln. because U.S. can’t assume Congress approval.



P.M.	Better to omit [  ] from para. 4 of draft telegram?



W.M.	Wd. or might commit us to send troops before U.S. sent any.



P.M.	U.S. show no sign of hesitn.  They have more ships there than we have.



W.D.	Looks as tho’ Radford has bn. authd. to discuss real planning with us.



S.LL.	(In reply to P.M.).  We mght hold advance conversns. with J., tho’ it wd. commit us still further to hostilities.



		Agreed :	In 1st. sentence of para. 4., insert “in light of T. 			Decln.” and omit “&amp; to discuss mil. action with 			the J. authies.”



W.D.	If we put in troops w’out first immobilising Israels’ air Force, they wd. be vulnerable.  Are Govt. ready to take that risk?



P.M.	Discuss with U.S.  If they wd. join us in neutralising I. Air Force, we cd. do it – not, I think, otherwise.



C.N.S.	Shd. we not suggest to our Allies tht. we shd. all warn Israel not to dig on Syrian frontier &amp; thereby to provoke Syria?



S.Ll.	They have bn. so warned, on several occasions.



P.M.	Handle this &amp; other points thro’ staff talks in W’ton.

	Also consider warning King (?via Glubb) that worst thing to do wd. be to engage Legion prematurely &amp; sacrifice best troops available.



		Agreed  :	Despatch 2nd. tel., making it more tentative

				&amp; suggesting tht. King shd. be approached first.





		4.	Foreign Secretary’s Mission to M/East.



	(a)	Egypt.  My line with Nasser : diffies. in M/E.; value of Bagdad Pact :

S.Ll.	our posn. in M/E. is essential because interests in Persian Gulf, &amp; we mean to stay (not Colonialism).  Soviet intrusion threatens.

	We can’t establ. modus vivendi with E., unless they cease propaganda try to settle with I. &amp; stop undermining our posn.  If they do this, we will help with Nile waters, ease their posn. with Iraq.



P.M.	Make it clear we stand by our policy &amp; our friends.  Commd. now to B. Pact &amp; we are going on with it.  Don’t weaken.  For w’out this nil to stop R. coming right down to P. Gulf.



S.Ll.	N. may object to extension e.g. Jordan.  He may press for undertakg. it won’t be extended.  I can say : no promise because they are independent countries : but if you play game we won’t press them to join.

	In India, I wd. be firm on this point.



C.N.S.	Pak. have bn. using B. Pact as means of enlistg. support in a war with India.



S.Ll.	If India attacked P., yes.  But [no ques of it, if P. attacked India]



C.N.S.	Remains true tht. P. have tried to get war with India discussed in B.Pact.

P.M.	We can give firm assurance to India to effect of [  ].

							[Exit 4. C.O.S.



		5.	Cyprus.



		Tel. 436 and 437.



P.M.	Final sentence of 437 are the trouble.  Wd. enrage Turks.



J.H.	Designed to make it clear tht. T. minority cdn’t obstruct on matters not directly affectg. their interests exclusively.

	S of S. has telephoned this a.m. pressing for our agreement to 437 – he and Govr. are both agreed on it.



R.A.B.	After “purpose” add “&amp; for providing safeguards for all sections of the community” in penultimate sentence?



P.M.	Wdn’t add to “for this purpose”.



S.	Add “As was made clear in the Ldn. talks” at beginning of last sentence but two.  Then he cd. look them up and see.

	And omit final sentence.				Agreed.



S.Ll.	F.O. points i) Govr. must be judge of time when internal security can be transferred.  See ms. in text.			Agreed.

	ii) An alternative to final sentence.

	“The constn. will adequately safeguard the interests of all sections of the community consistently with democr. principles &amp; good and orderly govt.”



		Agreed :	on last point.  We wd. sooner omit last

				sentence.  If he must have somethg. he cd.

				say above but substituting “liberal” for

				“democr.” principles.





6.	Malta.



P.M.	Saw Govr. y’day.  Agreed : Govr. will see Pope on Wed. on way back to Malta; will be in Malta on Wed. p.m.  Govr. wants ALB to call there on his way back to Ldn.  We have authorised him to do so.  He will see all Parties with view to accommn.

								[Exit J.H.



		7.	Parliament.



R.A.B.	Business for next week.

	Silverman’s Bill 12/3.  Will announce, if asked.

	Aim also to do Rpt. Stage of Teachers (Superannuation) in that week.





		8.	Visit of Russian Leaders.			[Enter H.A.



S.	Recognised this is decided – tho’ I regret it.

	But condonement of Communism by Crown.  Hope there will be no photograph.  						Agreed.

								[Exit D.S.



		9.	Betting and Lotteries.



Ll.G.	Less controversy now than some years ago.  More criticism now of Govt. inaction.

	Motion – is quite friendly : but we shall have to make some announcement.  Hope Cab. will authorise statement as in draft.

	As far back as ’53, H. Secy. said we cdn’t wait much longer.



K.	Strong support.



RAB.	97 Bills for next session already : and 15 are H.O. Bills.

	This will be about 40 Clauses.

	Give us indicn. of legn. in this session.  Don’t rush draftsman.



Ll.G.	We shall get credit for this.



R.A.B.	Prefer you shd. make it clear that it is when opportunity offers adding : [we hope in next session].



		Agreed :	subject to [  ].  But precise form of

				announcement to be settled with R.A.B.

				after F.L. Cttee. mtg.





10.	Farm Price Review.



H.A.	Explained stage reached in review.

	Officials guess farmers will ask for £40 M. as opening bid, justifying it by increased costs less added efficiency.  Might accept £30 M. as settlement.

	Last year we settled at £28 M. on much same increase in costs.  We can hardly go to £30 M. therefore.

	Don’t expect agreement, therefore : &amp; farmers themselves mayn’t want it.  Only one precedent (1948) for imposed settlement.

	H.M. suggests £20 M.  I wd. prefer somewhere betwn. £20-25 – to be sure of its defensibility.

	Propose therefore that officials shd. now start with prices giving about £17 M. leavg. room for manoeuvre of £5 M.



H.B.	This wd. be acceptable to H.M.  Tho’ no promise to go above £20 M.



R.A.B.	There will be trouble with N.F.U.’s over this.  Worth H.M.’s while to go to, say, £23 M.  The ½d. on milk wd. be v. helpful to Turner, and 6d. redn. vice 9d. on pigs.



H.B.	No economic ground for adding ½d. on milk.
