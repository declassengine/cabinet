C.M.29(56)							17th April, 1956





		1.	Parliament.					[Enter H.B., E.H.



R.A.B.	Business for next week.





E.H.	2.	Mid-Ulster by-election because of Beattie’s disqualificn.  No Ulster Unionist candidate.  Sinn-Fein prisoner and a Nationalist.  If latter decided not to stand, the pr. wd. be in – and no defeated candidate wd. be available to petition.  H/C. wd. have to express its opinion again.



Ll.G.	Once expd. the opinion stands, surely.

	As H/C. has decided he is not eligible to sit, cd. we not use Prison rules to prevent him from signing nomination forms.



E.H.	There is independent Unionist who mght stand.  Don’t know until writ is issued.



R.AB.	The official party won’t put up a candidate, because they are pretty sure they wdn’t lose.



		Agreed : no alternative but to move for the writ.





3.	Education : Burnham Committee.



D.E.	Negotns. procdg. : in diff. condns.  Chairman is ill, &amp; ordered a complete rest.  Normal for M/Ed. to preside in Chairman’s absence : unwise to adopt this course in diff. negotns.

	Alternatives :	permanent appointmt. of Coleraine.

			temporary appointmt. of Soulbury.



P.M.	Teachers are in difficult mood : wd. they re-act badly v. apptmt. of Tory?



H.	Believe Soulbury is too old.



I.M.	Think teachers wd. re-act v. Coleraine at present time.  Wd. like a 

x|	chance to suggest alternative name, for temporary appointmt.



		Agreed : as at x/.

							[Exit E.H.





		4.	Bahrain.



S.Ll.	Belgrave is anathema to moderate elements.  Br. opinion tht. he has outlived his usefulness.  Ruler, however, is v. lié with him.

	Tendency for reformers to become extreme – some of their leaders.

	Don’t want to drift into lasting commitment to keep troops there.



R.A.B.	Can we not ease him off?  Mustn’t appear to have bn kicked out – à la Glubb or at insistence of Cttee.



S.Ll.	The son is not fit to “inherit” Belgrave’s position.

	We need someone of calibre of Bell, now in Kuwait.  There are candidates from Sudan.

	The Ruler wd. need v. careful handling.



P.M.	x/	Much turns on quality of candidates available.



S.Ll.	The family are feeble.  Need therefore to get someone who cd. handle a weak Ruler.



H.A.	All to be gained by getting suitable Deputy into position.



S.	Support x/.  Look for the man first.



		Agreed : look for the man : consider how to ease him in.





5.	Singapore.		[Enter C.O.S., Carrington., A.H., N.B., C



A.L.B.	Marshall’s political situation is insecure.

	Cairo tel. suggest Marshall may be changing his mind.  Envisages breakdown : fears Communism in Singapore.  M’while must assume a united Delegn.

	If we break, we must have a posn. wh. we can defend to world opinion.

	Marshall’s heads of agreement are unacceptable.

	Para. 15 is my outline of an alternative.  (vi) is the most vital.

	Internal security : now responsibility of Ch. Secretary (official) but Council of Ministers wd. be responsible for policy.  If Police falls out of p’folio of Ch Secretary, we shd. lose advantage of discn. betwn him &amp; Govr. on timing of puttg ques to Council.  Their plan of Def. Council wd. give right of veto to elected Ministers : we cdn’t have that.  Alternative plan is 15(vi).

	C.O.S. apprecn.  – prob. didn’t know how far internal security has passed into hands of Ministers.



C.I.G.S.	C.O.S. Cttee. haven’t considered A.L.B.’s memo.

	Our views in D.C. memo.  Stress i) indep. Singapore apart fr. Malaya is not acceptable.  ii) Internal security.  Long-stop now is that Ch. Secy. is responsible Minister. iii) Local forces : can’t believe it will be effective : for shan’t get good Br. offrs.  Doubt if Marshall’s assurances on this are worth v. much.  iv) State of Police is not re-assuring.  If Malays (80%) co-operated with us &amp; were provoked by Ch. Communists, their anti-Chi. feelings mght get out of hand.  Their morale may deteriorate.

	Local Commrs. want Br. control of adminn. of police, with Ministers associated via a Cttee.  Para. 15 (iv) : operational aspects of security wd. be joint &amp; Govr. has reserve powers.  But Police morale mght have slipped so far tht., when troops were called in, our posn. wd. be diff. to retrieve.



P.M.	R. Scott &amp; Commrs. think Br. control of Police shd. be m’tained in normal &amp; in emergency times.



A.L.B.	Ch. of Police wants opposite course (mine) because wants to associate local Ministers with responsibility i.e. to share it.



H.	Your Def. Cttee. wd. be able to intervene in police policy before an emergency arose?  



A.L.B. 	Yes.



D.S.	Need we envisage independence for Singapore?  Even in fedn. with Malaya.



A.L.B.	Cdn’t hold it as dependent Colony indefinitely.



S.	Any commitment now?  This, surely, shd. be discussed at P.M.M.  Period is coming when we must decide wh. are vital strategic points in C. wh. we must retain – e.g. Singapore, Cyprus for a time, Gib.  We need short list of places we must hold, even at risk of a row.



H.		Menzies &amp; Holland : line is similar to A.L.B.’s.  But they stress need 

	y|	to retain control of internal security.  Shd. we suggest tht. A &amp; N.Z. shd. be repd. on Def. Council.



A.L.B.	H’to U.K. have repd. interests of other Doms.

	In reply to S. : we shall have to give some answers to Delegn. : cdn’t put it all off until P.M.M.

*	Suggest local commrs. shd. be asked for their views on 15(vi).



		Agreed : seek their views at once via Scott.



H.A.	Must keep in step with A &amp; N.Z., &amp; carry them with us on this.



H.	M.’s view : defence &amp; internal security are interlinked : Marshall shd. admit this, publicly.



C.	M/D. was anxious tht. Br. control shd. be m’tained over internal security in normal as well as emergency condns.  He wasn’t sure tht. 15(vi) gave that.



S.Ll.	Scott favours show-down early.  But his long-term solution is fedn. with Malaya.  I’m not sure tht. this wdn’t poison Malaya.



D.S.	Fear tht. 15(vi) will have effect tht Govr. will be unable to intervene in police matters unless he decides to call in troops.



K.	We have to reject paras. 11 &amp; 14 of heads of agreement.  Assuming we reserve defence to ourselves, our aim will be to get internal security so much intermingled with defence that we retain enough control over former.  A Def. Council is a practical route to that.

	This is important for all “smaller territories” : responsibility for such internal security as is necessary to protect our defence interests.



P.M.	*	Also get views of A. &amp; N.Z. Govts. on 15(vi). 		Agreed.

	Amend 15(vi) so as to put more emphasis on functions of Def. Council in reln. to internal security in normal times.



A.L.B.	Keep y/ in reserve.  Try a formula wh. wd. enable us to add them.  But don’t ask them yet.



P.M.	Suppose they suggest India or Ceylon to be repd. on it, too.

	Better keep it to “local service chiefs of Commonwealth Forces.”



H.	Para. 15	(i).   Not Free State.  Favour City State.

	  ..     ..		(ii).  H. Commr. now = Ambassador.



P.M.	Conduct of discussions.  A.L.B. to keep in touch with one or two colleagues.
