C.M.31(56)							26th April, 1956





		1.	Parliament.				[Enter E.H., Att.Gen.



R.A.B.	Business for next week.

	Motion on Agriculture : Monday.  Hostile and important. H.A. to open : R.A.B. to reply, with short intervention on Scotland (if necessary) by Parly. Secy. Scotland.



D.S.	Industrial Rating Bill.  Want to promise tht. we hope to announce before end of year our broad conclns. on review of L.G. finance.  Our supporters won’t otherwise be keen to vote down this Private Members’ Bill.



R.A.B.	Better to promise tht. we will open consultns. before end of this session with the l.a.’s.



D.S.	Review is well advanced : hope to open consultns. with l.a.’s in autumn : hope their conclns. will be announced before end/year.





		2.	Capital Punishment.



R.A.B.	Reasonable progress yesterday.  May still win a vote on amendment re armed criminal.  But 1½ days may finish it, and the Bill may well die because of amendments likely to be carried.



A.L.B.	Abolition of c.p. by ct. martial abroad may be v. embarrassing.

	

R.A.B.	Suggest C.O. &amp; Serv. Dpts. shd. meet and give proper advice on this ques.



	Att. Genl. shd. attend.  M/Defence to convene.	Agreed.

	To agree what is effect of the Bill &amp; to give firm advice to H.O.



								[Exit Att.G.

3.	Industrial Disputes.  Engineering Wages.



I.M.	£50 M. wd. be involved in equal pay claim in engineering.  AEU are askg. for Ct. of Enquiry into type of work women do.  I cdn’t do that.

	Only 1 in 8 of women in engineering are in Unions.

	Communists are running it, but right-wing Unions support it.

	There is likely to be trouble soon.



H.M.	Another wage claim, 8 wks. after last was granted.  We can’t let this drift.

	We shd. consider at once wtr employers shd. not be advised to say at once that this can’t be granted.

						*Cab. Office to arrange mtg.*





4.	Agriculture Policy.



R.A.B.	As in memo.



L.P.	Diff. to understand t. of r.



H.A.	Wd. look at them again in light of discns. now proposed.



RAB.	Welcome S.’s comments m’while.





		5.	Rent Restriction.



D.S.	As in memo.

	A main ques : can we do it this Session?

	Controversial at first : but, if done, people will begin to see in time its advantages – houses being repaired, people moving out of houses too large for them.



P.M.	Merits.  Surely, we must do this.



R.A.B.	But politics is the art of the possible.  Bad feeling in rural areas : and among teachers : rating re-valuation etc.,  Don’t underestimate pol. diffies. we face this summer.  Econ. advantages are plain : and our supporters who are interested in housing ques want this.  But ….



E.H.	Considered how it cd. be done this Session.  Wd. mean introdn. 15/15 : 2nd. Rdg. after Whitsun : compulsory time-table fr. the start in Cttee. : 3 mtgs a week wd. give only 30 hrs., wh. is barely enough, &amp; mght have to sit in afternoons : mght then pass it thro’ H/C. before end/July.  Moreover, mght cause Opposn. to try to upset rest of p’mme.



P.M.	Latest date for R. Assent?   If we got it by 31/3/57 we shd. have 18 mos. at least before an Election.  On that time-table we cd. introduce at v. outset of new Session.



R.A.B.	Restrictive Practices was introduced late enough in all conscience.  Cdn’t put in another v. late.

	If we do this, we shd. have to drop Copyright Bill – &amp; probly. others too.



P.T.	Gt. waste to lose the work done on that Bill.



J.S.	Badly stuck with Sc. Re-valuation Bill : shall need time-table for that.  Date of 14/5 for D.S. Bill wd. make my problem impossible.



H.M.	Real ques : when do you want this to be effective?  If passed this session, impact wd. start Dec.  If not, summer of 1957.  Spring or summer 1957 is latest possible date.



P.M.	R. Assent March wd. mean final effect long enough before Election viz., autumn ’58.



R.A.B.	R. Assent March mght be sweetened by a kinder Budget.

	Remember we have to work this summer on the £100 M.



I.M.	We cd. also accelerate by having 2 changes vice 3.



D.S.	At the further end, in terms of approachg. Election, 6 mos. is a lot.



H.M.	Scottish ques. is diff.  Shd. be U.K. Bill.



R.A.B.	Admit tht. our supporters wd. welcome v. early action.



D.S.	It wd. hearten our Party throughout the country.



		Agreed :	Bill approved.

				But introduce at outset of next Session.



		

6.	Russian Visit.



P.M.	Arms in M/E.  They offered to consider proposals.  But we cdn’t put any forward.  E.g. we don’t want embargo because want to be free to send to Iraq.

	M/East.  Important paras : calling on States concerned to avoid tension : supporting U.N. initiative.  Will please U.S.



S.Ll.	Also, earlier para. implies Soviet recognition of Israel.



P.M.	They declined, for historical reasons, to abjure use of veto.  Had “too much dust on it”.

	Disarmament.  Nuclear war will destroy “humanity” : admits it wd. affect Socialist, as well as capitalist, countries.  They didn’t press for abolition of tests.

	Trade.  Remarkable result.  Suppose 50% of list is w’in restrictions it wd. give us £100 M. [instead of] in addn. to existing level of £25 M.



P.T.	A lot wd. be fr. engineering industry.  Our delivery capacity wd. be almost as much a limiting factor as the strategic controls.



H.M.	How will they pay?



P.T.	They wd. have liked bi-lateral – tying us to take grain (maize) &amp; timber.  But we have evaded that.  They have admitted they will have to earn sterling in the world to pay for these purchases fr. U.K.



P.M.	Cultural contacts.  We expld. tht. they cd. hope for no expansion if they channelled this thro’ Comm-controlled organisations.  But, tho’ they wdn’t say so in communiqué, they promised to work thro’ Br. Council Cttee. : or, at least, not to work thro’ Communists.  If they don’t carry this out, we can w’hold visas.

	More secret matters.  On M/E. we had useful talks.  They now understand that M/E. oil is vital to us.  Indirect effect on their attitude.  They prob. see tht. Bagdad Pact is defensive, so far as we are concerned.  They promised to take a/c of our oil interests in assessing their policy.  If it so worked out that we cd. say publicly tht. we wd. not make new bases in B. Pact countries, that wd. have a v good effect on them.  If they saw Pact was defensive &amp; mainly economic they wd. be greatly re-assured.

	Religious toleration : Satellites : we made our protest, in mtgs.  We got no change.  But in private conversn. I stressed point that U.K/Soviet relations cd. not improve unless more freedom and toleration in Satellite countries.  They understood.  But they said tht., altho’ relns. were close, they cdn’t give orders to Poland or other Satellites.

	Colonialism.  We made our protest.  They begin to understand a little better, as regards independent Commonwealth.  Not much effect qua Colonies.



S.Ll.	I spoke about undermining our posn. – by reference to Libya.  He denied it.  Promised to look into it, on return.



P.M.	No attempt to drive wedges between us and U.S.



S.Ll.	V. self-confident about their economic strengths.  They can face a reduction of tension, with confidence.



P.M.	They urge me to visit Soviet Union.

	Propose to say : can’t fix a date.



H.A.	Public opinion will be – this was a success.

	Public re-action was about right.



P.M.	We have made no concession.  And on several points we have made our position clear.





		7.	Commonwealth : Government Borrowing.



		Memo. approved.





		8.	Aden.



A.L.B.	Industrial Commn. (strikes) will report today.

	No evce. (acc. to Govr.) that there is political agitation behind this – straight industrial issue.



H.M.	Under-payment, leading to discontent.  We shd. consider wtr limits are not too low.



A.L.B.	Govr. has authority to deport, if there is ground for it.



H.M.	May be much genuine grievance.  Deportns. wd. make it worse.



P.M.	Consider this urgently, on receipt of Commn’s. report.





		9.	Singapore.



A.L.B.	Have expld. privately to Marshall what we can’t do &amp; what we propose.  He will try to get agreement to our plan.  Mtg adjourned until Monday for talks w’in Delegation.
