C.M.34(55)							4th October, 1955





		1.	National Service.		[Enter A.H.  de L., BH., Noble



P.M.	Outline of statement which I propose to make, in speech form, on 5/10.

	Amendments discussed.



J.S.	Will provoke ques about future of H. Guard.



A.H.	Not ready quite to answer that.



S.Ll.	Some redn. inevitable : present cost = £1 M.



P.M.  	Wait until we have a full plan.



A.H.	Will you announce (soon) apptmt. of C-in-C., Land Forces?



S.Ll.	Depends on context : will submit suggn. on this.		Agreed.



P.M.	Cd. there be redn. in no. of Commands?



A.H.	Reducg. strengths (10%) but not no.



W.M.	Report on effect of N.S. on youths.  Wd. Cabinet wish to see it?  Result is encouraging.  Want to publish before Parlt. meets.



		Agreed :	Summary to be circulated to Cabinet.



H.C.	Inform old Doms.

							[Exit Serv. Ministers.



 

		2.	Teachers’ Superannuation.



D.E.	Teachers must accept increase to 6% : l.a.’s the oblign. to meet (subject to 60% grant) any increased liability.



R.A.B.	Support this plan.



D.E.	Shall open consultns. before Parlt. meets.



		Approved.





		3.	Aerial Advertising.				[Enter B.C., AttG.



B.C.	Discussed with D.S. &amp; J.S.  We agree tht. shouting shd. be prohibited &amp; advertising controlled.

	But Att.G. is doubtful wtr I can do this by Air navign. Order.  Will discuss method with him, if policy is approved.  Wd. be suitable for a Private Members’ Bill.



H.C.	Shd. it be used for public purposes?  Don’t want it at all.



Sal.	What l.a.’s wd. operate it?



P.M.	Try for all-out prohibition via Private Members’ Bill.

								[Exit Att.G.

[Enter N.B.

4.	Road Traffic : Park Lane Scheme.		[Enter H.M.



B.C.	Have proceeded h’to on basis of no interference with Decimus Burton screen.  M/W. wants now to open that possibility.  Fear further delay that wd. involve.  Traffic needs are urgent.  Don’t want to upset L.C.C.



N.B.	Recognise diffies. of M/T.  But i) damage to amenities of this plan wd. be v. great.  The screen cd. be moved to make entry to Serpentine road.  If that were done, range of new possibilities wd. be opened.  Might cater for 50% increase in traffic.  Cd. be done progressively.  M/T. agrees : but dislikes delay &amp; says it wd. take in more of Park.  No “aesthetic” addl. encroachment.  Unwise to go ahead with what may be 2nd. best.



Sal.	If you move screen you will take ring-road out of Park.  Fear it may lead to takg. it out on Bayswater Rd. &amp; Knightsbridge also.

       y|	May ultimately lead to chipping off Park all round.

	On balance I favour recommn. of M/T.



R.A.B.	Not clear what is considered view of Fine Arts Commn.  Take more time to get it right.

       x|	This (econ. sitn.) is not a good moment to start this.



B.C.	Dispute x/.  This is most urgent problem of Ldn. traffic.



D.E.	Tunnel will involve cutting down trees as far as H. Park Hotel.  That will raise a storm.  100 trees in all : but only 20 on Piccadilly.



N.B.	On y/. boulevard scheme takes E. Carr. Rd. out anyway.  Move of Dec. B. screen wd. not make it worse.



P.M.	Can Cab. see 2 models of the competing scheme



B.C.	M’while, may I tell L.C.C. that Govt. regard this as urgent – as

       z|	agreed in earlier Cab. decision.



D.S.	I support x/.  This wd. be v. spectacular.



P.M.	Tell LCC z/ : add that we don’t exclude removal of the screen, and are considering what alternative there may be on that basis : that Fine Arts Commn. will be consulted. 

	M/T. and M/W. to review, with M/Housg.  Road Research Lab. can help; L.C.C. to be associated with review.

								[Exit N.B.



		5.	Japan : Trade and Payments.



R.A.B.	Good assurance fr. J. on imports fr. sterling area.



P.M.	Trade quotas is the main thing?



P.T.	Support memo.

	But J. has £80 M. balance : on this it will rise to £100 M.  And we shall have to justify open door in Col. to J. because no b/p. diffy. to warrant restn. of imports to Colonies.  Can just be done, with powerful statemt. by R.A.B.

	Two snags : i) J. cd. in Jan. make bi-lateral deal with Pakistan on textiles.  A double blow for Lancs.  Hope our negotiators will tell J. that on review after 6 mos.  HMG. will give serious consn. to any exclusive bi-lateral deals.  A warning : so that we may have an answer to criticism.

	ii)  Quotas.  Support §13.  Try for another £2 M. in return for £3 M. of canned salmon.  If they decline, I wd. cut £1 M. off their grey cloth.

	On £2 against £3, we can start with £ for £, but we won’t get it.



R.A.B.	Don’t think we can hope to do better than proposed in memo.

	Unlikely to get a better deal.



P.M.	Try £ for £ : authorise £2 for £3 in last resort : but, if we don’t get that, cut £1 M. off grey cloth.



		Agreed :	subject to P.T.’s (i) and (ii)

				Ty. to consider with B/T. and F.O. what more 

can be done on shipping.





		6.	Economic Situation.



R.A.B.	Figures.



P.T.	Trade figures look a little better.



P.M.	Decision v. earlier recall of Parlt.



D.S.	Had wished to introduce Housing Bill as soon as Parlt. meets, so that 2nd. Rdg. cd. come early thereafter.  Don’t want 2 debates.  Introdn. wd. preclude discn. of this in the general debate.



P.M.	Discuss this with R.A.B.

R

.A.B.	Don’t want it excluded from opening debate.

								[Exit B.C.





		7.	Foreign Affairs.				[Enter K.



H.M.	Genl. deterioration since I took over.

	a)   Détente at Geneva has increased our diffies. because it has re-opened so many issues : open warfare vice trench warfare.  

Everyone is ready to take chances now on all policy ques.  

b)   Paralysing effect in U.S. of Eisenhower’s illness.  Republicans have little chance, unless Adlai is Democratic candidate because wisecracks á la Guedalla don’t please U.S.

	UN. Assembly.

	French will go to Sec. Council but not Assembly.

	Cyprus – we did v. well to win.

	Algeria – Fr. failure in N.Africa is affectg. whole Arab world.

	Arms to M/East.

	R. have made deal with E., &amp; prob. overtures to S. Arabia.

	Looks as tho’ R. finding stalemate or stabilisn. in F/E., have decided to fish actively in M/E. waters.  Our posn. isn’t v. easy – a little ambivalent.

	Mystery of E. deal.  Seems tht. R. started it &amp; then switched it over to Czecho.  R. cd., w’out damage, part with v. large nos. of obsolescent arms : these are not new Mig to wh. R. Air Force are turning over.  Far more available than we, or prs. even U.S., have to offer.

	How handle this – with giver or receiver or both.

	Mentioned to Mol., who seemed upset.  Tho’ he had prev. told Dulles tht. he knew somethg. of it.

	We cd. make protest or appeal to Bulganin – not consistent with Geneva spirit – if this were isolated deal.  But we know now tht. they are approachg. other Arab States.  This must be a new policy.  Cd. we knock them off it?  They don’t always persevere in a try-on.  That is case for P.M.’s proposed message

	A message fr. P.M. mght be followed by one fr. Eisen. if he recovers.

	What line shd. we take in such a message?  Alarmg. prospect if we had to meet in confce. with R. and French on arms to M/E.

	At receiving end : Nasser was alarmed, tho’ putting bold face on it by our &amp;U.S. repns.  He depends wholly on Army – no other basis of support.  This is all he intends – not to put his head in Communist noose.

	Conference with D. y’day.  Agreed tht. a strong squeeze on Nasser wd. affect U.K. interests adversely.  Favour a mild squeeze: a) informn. about order  b) get a term put to it  c) no technicians.  Means of squeezing – i) get on with independence of Sudan : don’t allow the 18 mos. interval.  



P.M. 	Favour that on merits. 



[H.M]	ii) nothing else(!). Make it appear tht N.’s benefits are reduced (slowed down) : others who behave better get more.  But U.S. won’t join N. Tier., unless Alpha succeeds.  My problem was to prevent U.S. from swinging pro Israel viz., unilateral guarantee to Israel alone.  But will U.S. support N. Tier – not only morally, but with money &amp; arms.  H’to, we have insisted tht. we shd. supply Iraq with arms : big step to allow U.S. to join : but easier for them to give arms than money.  Try to show benefits for Lebanon and Syria as well as Iraq.

	Ques : can we do more, at either end.



P.M.	V. serious sitn. is developing in M/E. 

	We need to review drastically our M/E. policy.  We must realise tht. U.S. has almost always bn. wrong on M/E.  They are ignorant of it &amp; can’t steer steady course.  The big interest in M/E. is ours – not U.S.  We are dependent on M/E. oil.  We must therefore do our own thinking on this.  Trucial Coast &amp; Iraq is more important now than Egypt.  [Remember error of U.S. view on Commn. in Persia.  Alpha : they were most reluctant to start &amp; they have ruined it by trying to launch it alone.]

	One correct course is to help our friends – esp. Iraq.  U.S. ought to help with cash off-shore).  Eis. was ready to do so on tanks for Iraq : &amp; they have failed to come along.  We may have to spend more – to save Iraq oil.

	Giving end.  Do R. realise how dangerous this game is qua risk of war betwn. E. &amp; Israel.  They can’t want to see such a war – wd. affect them v. soon.  I wish therefore to send cautionary word explaing. why we don’t regard this as commercial deal.  We must put our case in some form.  Wd. sooner do it privately to Bulg.  Wish to send some message.  I admit risk.  They may retort : we shd. discuss this ques e.g. at Geneva.  But what alternative.  Are we to leave R. to hawk these offers all round M/E.  We don’t even know amount of N. order : can’t assess size of problem.  We cd. restrict scope of any discns. we entered with R. – viz., this particular deal pro. tem.  I wd. be ready to accept temporary ban on all supply of arms to M/E. countries.



R.A.B.	Fishing enquiry more useful than no action.

	At home, we shall be asked if we have approached R.  Don’t want to have to say “none”.



Sal.	Dangerous to allow anti-Comm. front to disintegrate.  For readiness of R to be reasonable seems less than it did at Geneva.

	No future in threatening E. any more.  Risk of rebuff.  Wd. sooner isolate them &amp; ignore them if we can – &amp; consolidate the N. Tier.  If that can be done – how much will U.S. help.

	R. end.  Doubt if message now will do good : but can it do harm.  Even if they suggest a mtg., we can limit discn. at it.  We shall be expected to have said somethg. to R.  We may elicit some more of their policy and intentions.



D.S.	Support project &amp; terms of message.



		Approved despatch of message.





		8.	Industrial Hostels.



W.M.	Have bn. closing a no. of industrial hostels.  Propose now to announce tht. I shall close remainder w’in next 12 mos.

	This is right, &amp; saves money.  But there will be some protests.





	[C.M. 35(55) – 38(55) : missed on account of sick-leave.]
