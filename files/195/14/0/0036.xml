C.M.26(56)							29th March, 1956





		1.	British Somaliland.				[Enter E.H.



A.L.B.	Project for buying the Haud.



P.M.	Wd. they sell – Ethiopian pride?  They will suspect we suppose there is oil.



S.Ll.	D-Parker’s mission to Ethiopia : object to keep E. with the west.  If we offer to buy, v. likely they will decline : but we cd. at least tell Somalis we had tried.

	What is future of this area.  Not viable.  Italians &amp; we can’t carry it alone.  Only hope = consortium.  But if E. were in, Somali wd. loathe it : and if they weren’t, they wd. make trouble.



A.L.B.	Italians are bringing in Egyptians to run (mainly teachers) their part of Somaliland.



S.Ll.	I am enquiring into that : will see wtr we can’t point out risks to Ital. Govt.



D.E.	Italy herself is v. short of teachers.



P.M.	We can’t do all this at once. Must proceed by stages.  

	Can we now authorise an offer to buy Haud – no price named.



H.M.	Don’t want to pay.



A.L.B.	They mght take obsolete warships in lieu of cash.



H.M.	We have bn. stiff over loans to Caribbean &amp; Malaya.  Strange to pay out for this odd desert.



A.L.B.	If we allow this area to become unstable, it will cost us much more to protect flank of Kenya.



P.M.	I am ready to send personal message to Emperor.  F.O. &amp; C.O. to draft*



S.Ll.	First object of mission wd. be to try to secure E. compliance with

P.M.	agreement.  Then, if he can’t get assurance on that, feel out possibilities of transfer – as against anything save cash e.g. old ships.



		Agreed.



A.L.B.	C.P. 89.  May I instruct Govr. on lines of para 9.



R.A.B.	No early announcement here, I hope.  We have had enough.



A.L.B.	Announcement there will tend to calm, vice incite.  And no need for announcemt. here.



S.	And no promises of dates for independence.



P.M.	Let us have apprecn. by C.O.S. on strategic importce. of this area.  We must know wtr we are going to stay here, or go.



		Agreed :	Approve para. 9.

				Apprecn. by C.O.S.

							[Enter P.M.G.



		2.	Television : Ministerial Broadcasts.



P.M.	Wd. like to make t.v. b’cast before visit to Soviet leaders.

	What do Cabinet think?

	Ministerial T.V.  Wd. be a new departure.  B.B.C. wd. be ready to start this &amp; regard this as appte. moment.



Ch.H.	Wd. like to see this barrier broken down.



R.A.B.	Party wd. like this b’ground painted in.

	Want to break this barrier : believe Gaitskell wd. collapse if we took bold line on this.



J.S.	Feeling in country re visit is better : less need to explain.



H.A.	I wd. be in favour.



		General view : in favour.  This wd. be ideal occasion for

		a Ministerial telecast.

								[Exit Ch.H.



		3.	Industrial Disputes : Shipbuilding.



I.M.	More behind this than appears.  Wood working is a disappearing trade &amp; natural tht. worker shd. hold on to what it can.

	T.U.C. have not bn. good at intervening.

	V. strong condemnation of Union in the rpt. of Cttee.

	Thinkg. of bringing general ques. to N.J.A.C.I.  After that wd. invite Cab. to consider wtr we cd. do “a little more”.

	Advise adherence to view tht. legn. is not the answer.



P.M.	The local Branch has controlled this : and Secy. is Communist.  That shd. be brought out.



I.M.	Will see that Press is aware of that.





		4.	Restrictive Practices Bill : Steel Industry.



H.M.	When Cab. took earlier decision, fear I hadn’t realised effect.

	Must seek a compromise.

	If we are to sell 2 large cos. &amp; avoid charges of breach of faith with those who have bought cos. already sold, we must find a means of allowg. Fund to continue.  Either by declaring this a matter for Bd., or by securing v. quick decision by new Tribunal.

	If we don’t, Chairman of Agency.

	Prices are fixed : what is wrong with control over materials?

	If Cab. decide in principle tht. compromise must be sought, we will try.



P.T.	Ready to look for tht.  But not ready to accept reversal of earlier decn. tht. steel shd. not be excluded fr. Bill.  

	Ty. arguments in memo. are sound, but not usable in public.

	Two ways out :-

		(i) Agency shd. consider this further.  Not the case that terminn. 	of Fund wd. ruin the cos. : it wd. affect price of steel.  This 	argument is over-stated.  But, if it isn’t.

		(ii) How keep Fund going?  It cd. be made statutory under Bd., 	&amp; then wd. be outside Bill.  Have asked A.F. to consider that 	possibility.



H.M.	(ii) may be the way out.



D.S.	Future financial prospects of firms wd. be jeopardised very seriously if future of Fund seemed uncertain.  It is a real point.

	(ii) is not merely a power, but a duty, of Steel Board.





		5.	Civil Service.	Pay.



H.M.	£14 M. on Civil Service and £12 (?) M. on P.O. workers.

	If we really cut nos. by 15.000, we may save £14 M. or so.

	If we went to arbitn., we shd. do worse.

	Moral : press on with redn. of numbers.



	6.	Malta.



J.S.	A.B.’s ques wtr Bill is to be passed before Genl. Election.



P.M.	That part of Bill will be expressed as operable by Order at some later date.
