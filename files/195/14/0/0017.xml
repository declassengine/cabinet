C.M.7(56)							24th January, 1956

									(6.30 p.m.)



	Economic Situation.



H.A.	{Milk Prices.

	{Bread Subsidy.  Can’t now justify subsidy for national flour on nutritional grounds for medical report received showg. that it has no more nutritional value than flour of higher extraction.



I.M.	Objns. on grds. of wage claims.  P.M. is to see Unions, on return from W’ton, before Easter conferences.

	No logical case v. removing bread subsidy.  But no logic in wage claims.  Autumn budget caused workers to increase wage claims – e.g. builders &amp; transport salaried staffs.

	Deliberate Govt. action increasing c/living will provoke further claims.  Little prospect of securing atmosphere of wage restraint if this is done.  

	Mght be done in a Budget, accompanied by concessions to poorer classes.



P.M.	On merits, it can’t be defended.  Timing needs much thought.  Final decision must be taken in reln. to state of wage claims at the time.  This suggests deferring decision for a time.



R.A.B.	Favour abolition, on econ. grds.  But on timing, how shall we stand with claims?



I.M.	Engineering &amp; ship-bldg. is the main claim.  Settlement is likely at about the 7% of rlway settlement.  Mght be reached on 2/2.  If cleared then or soon after, 7% or 4/= will prob. be the pattern &amp; claims likely to go thro’ w’out major industrial disturbance.  By 3rd. or 4th. week in Feb. we mght expect to be in clear water.



J.S.	Abolition of bread subsidy wd. bring adminve. savings – staff in Govt. and in industry.  Economic case is complete.  Timing : wd. prefer a package, pref. in a Budget, with compensations to pensioners etc.,  Believe it shd. be done fairly soon.



B.C.	This, with milk, wd. increase costs of poorest classes by 7½d. a week.

	N. Assistce. scales were increased y’day : this addl. cost wd. mean that 50% of increase had bn. offset.  No immediate revision of scales.

	N. Insurance benefits now are about balanced at original value – if this were done, we cd. no longer claim that.



W.M.	This will have immedte. effect on c/living.

	Bound to affect outstandg. wage claims.

	If it must be done, ques is wtr it shd. be done in this package or in a Budget.  If this package is to be announced in mid-Feb., it wd. affect current wage claims.



A.L.B.	Cd. there be off-setting concessions in a Budget?



H.M.	If we don’t do this, we shall be criticised for cowardice – once again.

	Timing : either p’pone all until Budget, or include this in 1st. package.  Otherwise we shall be in trouble because of being thought afraid of this.

	Is it good politics to do this in a Budget – when it will be counted in a balance of what is given to rich and what to poor.

	I wd. prefer to have the row on this over before Budget.

	Sign of courage – and will be so regarded all over the world.

	There will never be a moment when there is no wage claim pending.  But big claim (engineering) seems likely to be out of the way by time I want to make announcement – week beginning 20/2 at latest.

	The Socialist argument will be for controlled economy – import controls and subsidy.  We must try to make free economy work : and this Budget may be our last chance to do so.  After this it will be too late.



P.M.	After engineers, come miners &amp; builders.



H.M.	I want this in first package : but am ready to relate timing of that package to progress of wage claims.  Ready to wait until 20/2 vice 15/2.



P.M.	Still apprehensive about effect of this on our relations with moderate Labour.  If we do this, shall we ever get our talks with T.U.C.



J.S 	Some elements in c/l. index are going down.  Bread &amp; milk together mean only 1.7 points – not a v. large rise to be offset by other reductions.



D.S.	Impressed by H.M.’s arguments against doing this in Budget.



P.T.	Depends on what whole package looks like.  Cuts in capital exp’re are what we need to curb inflation.  This is less urgently necessary.  If package looks like makg. solid impact, believe this mght be p’poned until Budget.



H.M.	Can we agree in principle that this shd. be done, either in Feb. package or in Budget.  Go ahead with plans, leaving that choice open.



P.M.	My political instinct is still against it.



R.A.B.	It wd. be easier to do it in Budget.



K	1/= wage increase totals £50 M p.a.  Is this saving real?  Save £41 M on this and find it costs you £50 M. in wages.



H.M.	Absence of this from a Feb. statement will shake confidence abroad.



P.M.	Prepare plan on basis [that this will be done] either in Feb. or in Budget.  					of doing this.



H.A.	Unwise not to do all unpopular things at once.  Prefer earlier date.



D.E.	Prefer earlier date.



E.H.	Feeling in Party.  A section wd. regard this as test of Govt. courage.  Another section regards it as likely to increase wage claims.  Another wd. accept it as part of a package.

	Majority will prob. be influenced mainly by sensitivity twds. any increase in c/living of any action contrary to stability of prices.



	Agricultural Review.



H.A.	Demand likely to be so big that settlement may have to be imposed.

	Cost this year will be £40/50 M. less than estimate.

	Don’t expect settlement for next year to be less than actual cost this year.  Prob. somewhere betwn. actual &amp; estimated – imposed.

      *	Wd. like Cttee. RAB., H.M., &amp; 3 Agric Ministers : to guide Review.



H.M.	And less bargaining than in previous years.



	Social Services.  Cttee. unlikely to report before Budget.



D.E.	Favour increase in charge for school meals.  I wd. raise it to 1/=.



J.S.	We have aimed at paying cost of food, not service.  That is 10d. : we charge 9d.  Is it worth making the change?



H.M.	I wdn’t press for this, if it’s clear we are doing bigger things.



		D.E. &amp; J.S. to discuss with H.M.



	Administrative Costs.



H.M.	To carry out P.M.’s decision, co-opn. by Ministers will be needed – and we must accept some lowering of administrative standards.

	This won’t be easy.



H.A.	I cd. save 1.000 – as result of abolition of subsidies &amp; other changes.



	Coal Imports.  see above : morning mtg.



P.T.	Steel Imports.  V. diff.  Steel prices ought to rise : but must try for stability : must not seem too inconsistent with policy of stable prices.



		Agreed :	continue to study this, as proposed in para. 62. 			incldg. possibility of ending “averaging” of 				prices of imported and U.K. produce steel.  



H.M.	Import Controls.  Cd. do this w’out legn.  Mght be possible to do some of this.  And must have a plan for “crash” action.  But importance of avoiding forestalling.



P.T.	Concentrate on “crash” plan.  No scope for normal control : for its not in luxuries but in essential raw materials that excess imports are coming in.



H.	Two operations.  First may misfire – esp. if it didn’t include bread &amp; milk.  V. gt. advantage if it cd. all be done in a March Budget.
