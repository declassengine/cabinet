C.M. 23(55)								14th July, 1955



									[Enter B.H.

		1.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Debate on Coal 20/7 : on motion to take note of annual report for NCB for ’54.



R.A.B.	Review of offls.  Plan to slim off exports until we end with none save to Eire. We must come down to 5½ m. exports v. soon.  But ques : can we retain our bargaining in trade Treaties if exports of coal go much lower.  

Imports of coal – not wholly tragic because reflects increasg. prodn. in industry tho’ falling prodn. of coal.

	Ministers must look at export policy.  G.Ll. can’t announce it on Wed.  He shd. however say tht. even tho’ we may cut investment generally we can’t cut investment in coal.



P.T.	We shd. examine the study.  But believe coal exports will have to be reduced.



RAB.	Ministers concerned cd. meet to discuss this study on Mon. – before debate.



P.M.	Ready to accept redn. to 5½ m. + principle tht. we shdn’t export coal except to secure valuable trade advantage.

	Minister’s shd. meet &amp; settle this on Mon. next, at latest.

	Govt. spokesmen : G.Ll. + H.C. or Ll.G. [RAB., G.Ll., P.T., Ll.G., H.C.]

	x	Parlt. to re.assemble on Oct. 25.    x





		Gowers’ Report on Offices etc.



Ll.G.		20 Queis to-day.  Want to be a little forthcoming.



P.M.		Widen up answer to cover whole subject &amp; indicate Govt.’s plan for handling it.





		2.	Technical Educn.



D.E.		Debate 21/7.  Shd. have to admit we are doing less than 1/3rd. of programme.  Cd I have authy. to refer to a 5 year plan.



R.A.B.		Cd. pray in aid exp’re on technology under U.G.C.  Will consult with D.E. on a formula.



P.T.		Shortage is crippling us.  We must be sure tht. our plans are ambitious enough.



D.E.		Enormous demand for technical courses – both at techn. colleges &amp; at secondary schools.



			Agreed : expedite re-building at Imp. Institute.





		3.	Ministerial Remuneration.



R.A.B.		Want Cab. discn. next week – so tht. we may make some soundings with Oppn. &amp; supporters before recess.  We cd. then make some progress during summer.

										[Enter B.C.



		4.	Road Haulage Disposals.



B.C.		Do Cab. agreed tht. Br. Road Services shd. be retained?

		Timing of statement.  Not too soon after recent debate



		(1)	Agreed : B.R.S to remain w’in B.T.C.



P.T.		Cd. rlways take over their operation?



B.C.		Prefer a central organn. for road services.



P.M.		Won’t our supporters claim tht. 1953 Act wd. be frustrated by leaving B.R.S. in B.T.C.



A.L.B.		B.T.C. wd. have power to delegate to Reg. Bds. control over road services.



P.T.		Don’t close door to opern. of these services by rlway side of B.T.C. – regionally.



R.A.B.		Add somethg. to indicate tht. this “doesn’t preclude ideas” in the future.



		(2)	Draft statement.



Sal.		Confine para. 1. to position under 1953 Act.  Continue : main objects of Part II of Act have bn. achieved.

		Also minor amendments in other paras.



J.S.	     x/	in para. 5.  We don’t want another failure.  Shd. we try, if we are likely to fail?



B.C.		There is reasonable chance that we may be able to sell : in Oct., when it has bn. workg. as separate co. for some months.



			Statement approved subj. to amendments.

										[Exit B.C.



		5.	Four-Power Talks.



P.M.		Have held preparatory mtgs.

		West is in strong posn..  Cohesion : ahead on nuclear.

		But, in long term, there is known impetus in G. twds re-unificn.  R. can prevent that happening on terms acceptable to West &amp; can offer it later on terms tempting to G. &amp; unpalatable to us.

		Thus, we have everythg. to gain by pressing for agreemt. on G.  R.’s interest is to delay that.

		I wd. not therefore be content with upshot, relaxed tension but no advance on G. re-unification.  Believe U.S. wd. agree.  Fr. wdn’t be so keen.  Adenauer’s age also indicates R. interest to delay.  My aim is therefore to press hard for a move on G.

		Similar sitn. in Berlin over Austria.  R. refused to budge.  But later they moved because they thght it wd. pay them better to do so.  We may be able to make such an offer on G. tht. they can’t afford to reject it.

		We start therefore with Eden plan.  We don’t think it’s enough.  So we will indicate what limitns. cd. be imposed on a re-united G. to ensure tht. she will not represent increased mil. threat to R.

		We think we shd. have to include (not at Geneva) arrangemt. about strengths of forces, some area in G. for de-militarisation : relaxn. of tension &amp; Security Pact (w’out guarantee of frontiers).

		No sign yet of any flexibility on R. side.

		Their delegn. includes : Bulganin, Molotov, Kruschev &amp; Zhukof.  A formidable team.



H.M.		R. won’t come far in 1st. round.

		Our trouble will be to persuade U.S. to open substantive ques.

		Next phase will be temptation of Germany.  Some bluff in this.  Suppose G. accepted.  Wd. R. really want to w’draw if G. had to be left to remain neutral &amp; disarmed.  They might distrust them on that.

		Our aim must be to take a line wh. world opinion will think reasonable, if R. reject it.

		In 2nd. round, after Ad. visit to R., we shall want to do business.  To make that possible, we shall need to have put our project in 1st. round.



P.M.		Ascertain wtr U.S. will bring Wilson now it’s know tht. Zukof is coming.  If he is, S.Ll. shd. come.  R.M. to find this out at once. [Agreed.]





		6.	Cyprus.



H.M.		….  We shall have to choose our line.  Either i) some régime on analogy of Tangier, in which 3 Powers wd. be associated in control tho’ no change was made in sovereignty : or ii) a plan to allow self-govt. to run for 10 yrs, when 3 parties wd. consult on ques of sovereignty : that wd. in effect surrender decn. (via veto) to Turkey.  There may be many variants, but all plans will be of one or other of these types.

		Don’t put fwd i) and fall back on ii).  For impn. of scuttle.



A.L.B.		Type (i) plan : wd. lead, not to condominium, but pandemonium – acc. to opinion in Cyprus.  But mght not, if T. &amp; G. had agreed to operate it.

		Type (ii) plan : may be beginning of surrender of sovereignty &amp; wd. be so regarded as many.  Durg. the 10 yrs, many Cypriots mght begin to doubt wisdom of assocn. with Greece, &amp; mght favour staying with us.  Much may happen in 10 years.



P.M.		How do we handle this – with A.L.B. away when HM is here.



H.M.		If we meet 24/8.  ALB returns on 4/9.  Preliminaries cd. be spread over several days.

		I cd. however p’pone date until 29/8, so long as that is not a Tuesday (fall of Constantinople)   –   Agreed.



P.M.	      *	Have a memo. prepd. for Cab. decision in week beginning 25/7.   *



Sal.		At Confce. invite T. &amp; G. to develop their views before we disclose our plans on Cyprus’. constitutional future.



S.Ll.		I will submit memo. on views of C.O.S.





		7.	Housing : Subsidies.



D.S.		Am cutting down new houses.  But politically diff. to m’tain posn. tht. only type of bldg. over wh. there is any control = houses for poorer people.  Surprised we have held it so long.  It will come to a head in Oct., on new l.a. programmes.  Our policy must be disclosed then.  There will be pol. trouble.

		Ty. want redn. in subsidy.  I wd. favour abolishg it for all new houses save those to be built for slum replacemt., new towns, overspill.  Then system of allocations to l.a.’s can be abandoned.  That wd. reduce by 40% area over wh. subsidies wd. be paid on new houses.

		If l.a.’s averaged it out, max. increase in rent wd. be a little over 1/= a week.  Most wd. be 5d. or 6d.  And that on assumptn. tht. the l.a. had no subsidised new houses (slums etc.,)

		Wish to begin to prepare p. opinion on this – &amp; be able to open discussions with l.a. associations.  Want therefore to indicate now we shall be reviewg. whole ques – as outlined in para. 10.



R.A.B.		Limit Cab. discn. to para 10 proposals.  I accept (a) and (c).  But wdn’t go into detail of (b).  Words “every aspect” cd. be added to (c).



P.M.		(b) wd. precipitate demand for debate.  Accept R.A.B.’s modified announcement.



J.S.		Gt. diffies.  i)	variation from one area to another.  Many in Scotland

				where absolute shortage of houses – irrespective of 

				slums.



P.M.		Need you go beyond 10(a)?



R.A.B.		Want this policy.  But don’t want early statement, lest l.a.’s go ahead in order to forestall.



D.S.		Shall have to make an announcement early in October.



P.M.		Cab. can decide policy &amp; you can discuss with l.a. assocns. in Sept.



			Agreed:	D.S. to say as little as possible before H/P. rises : if he

				can, nothg. at all : lest he provokes demand for debate.





		8.	Japan and G.A.T.T.



H.M.		Still favour voting in favour of J.’s inclusion.



P.T.		We shall have to announce it.  Won’t that rouse H/C.?

		Do we want to precipitate debate on G.A.T.T.

		Posn. at Geneva is complex.  Still possible tht. Benelux &amp; G. will run out &amp; J. won’t get in.  Shd. we not wait &amp; see what happens on that.  Posn may develop at end/July in wh. only our intervention can get J. in.  But a chance J. may get in w’out our vote.  Can’t we wait &amp; see.



H.M.		Abstention is regarded as opposition.

		J.’s position is important to world balance of power.

		They will resent our abstaining, wtr they get in or not.



RAB.		During the 2 wks. posn. has become more obscure.



			Agreed :	Bring up at Cab. in next week and in week beginning

				25/7.

				Tho’, if it seems that she gets in, we shd. vote in favour

				at last moment.

				B/T. to watch the position.

										[Exit B.H.



		9.	Palestine.



H.M.		Had hoped to handle Alpha plan on Trieste model.  Now looks as tho’ we can’t.  But, more serious, Dulles is insistent tht. he shd. make public statement of his posn. for domestic pol. reasons (N. Yk. vote).  This may enflame opinion in M/E., esp. among Arabs.

		We can’t prevent D. from making statement.  We can’t say it’s bad plan because we made it with U.S.

		[Arabs cling to truce because don’t want to admit, by peace, Israel’s existence.  They hope it may go bust.]

		If statement is p’poned, a worse statement by U.S. is inevitable as Election approaches.  But if statement is to be made with our agreemt. we shd. get a price for it.  I suggest in para 7  3 concessions we mght secure in exchange.

		Do we associate ourselves with this statement if these concessions are obtained?



P.M.		Announcement wd. have v. alarming effect in M/E.  I wd. be influenced by report of emissary to Iraq.  

		Cd. H.M. say to D : This was intended as plan for negotiation.  Quite a difft. thing to publish it in advance.  Big decision for us, in view of our M/E interests.  We need more time to study it.  Cd. he not p’pone for a time?  Wd. it not be better as Anglo-U.S. plan? We shd, if so, want to amend it.



									           [Enter H.A.

S.Ll.		Real diffy. for us arises on Part III.  Frontiers are there defined in a sense unfavourable to Arabs.  If you intend to negotiate with parties, unwise to disclose such details in advance.



H.M.		Will ask for more time.  But do we attempt to get para. 7 concessions.



H.		Settlement betwn. Israel/Egypt is best approach to a settlement of Arab/Jew conflict.  Isn’t situation more favourable for that.



H.M.		We must avoid sitn. in wh. we get all the blame &amp; none of credit.



P.M.		Put para. 7 points as your views, not views of Cabinet.



Sal.		Cd. we not have objective Anglo-U.S. statement first – followed by D.’s “political” version?



H.M.		I wd. offer i) U.S./U.K. statement ii) U.S./U.K. co-opn. in dealg with Arab reactions.

									[Exit R.A.B.



		10.	Japanese War Criminals.



H.M.		Major criminals are under internatl. control – &amp; prerogative is not involved.  It is involved only for minor.

		Proposal wd. involve immediate release of 81 prs. 



J.S.		Feeling has worked itself off.



H.M.		Other countries are doing the same.  Even Austr. accept this : have done it.



A.L.B.		Won’t be liked.  But right to do it.



Ll.G.		This is in accord with “civil” practice.



S.Ll.		Wd prefer to do it in batches – say, three batches over 12 months.



H.M.		Diff. to introduce any principle into that plan.



A.L.B. 	Link it with decision on major criminals, wh. was not wholly in our control.  And do it v. quietly.  



H.M. 		Allow me to put further memo. showg. what wd. happen in practice. 



H.A. 		Explain need to F/E P. of W. Association. 



			Agreed : decision to be deferred.





		11.	Uganda. 



A.L.B.		Near agreemt. save on 2 points – i) method of election to Ex. Council.  ii) date of return of Kabaka

		There has bn. tranquillity &amp; co-opn. in Uganda.  

		After new constitn. is in, &amp; elections completed, allow Kabaka to return 6 weeks (or not less than 2 months) after that date.  this is being put to Lukiko.  Shall know their view by early next week.  Hope to announce by end of next week.
