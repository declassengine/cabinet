C.M.32(55)							21st September, 1955





		1.	Economic Situation.				[Enter B.H.



R.A.B.	Loss for Sept. likely to be $150 m or more.  Due largely to settlement with Europe.  [Up to date $112 m.]  Deficit with E.P.U. of £37m will have to be carrd. fwd. into Oct.  So figures won’t be good for Oct., as well as Sept. : cdn’t well be less than $100 m.  Reserves, at highest in Nov. 54 (3 billns.), are now 2.349. m. – a considerable decline moving twds. level of Jan ’54 (2.500 &amp; going up).  1650 was lowest level – Budget of ’52.  Further action is essential to check this.  Wish therefore to proceed with plan for re-call of Parlt. and introducg. further measures of restraint.  We shd. thus retain initiative.  Return 18 or 25 Oct.

	At Istanbul, no-one doubted fundamental strength of sterling but concerned at our wages spiral, coal, &amp; competitive power of exports.



P.M.	I was doubtful.  Feared mght create crisis atmosph.  Mght recall Labour fin. crises.  Diff. to get Parlt. up when once re-convened.

	Wd. sooner have waited until Oct., if we cd. have said July medicine was working.  But, if it is not, we shd. be in diff. posn. at Party Confce. etc., if unfavourable figures come out just before it.



H.C.	Don’t like a recall.  Will create crisis atmosphere.  No indicn. tht. situation is deteriorating – Cab. have not bn. mtg.  Will the shock not be damaging to confidence.

	Shan’t get Parlt. to go away again without debates on Cyprus, Mclean etc.,  And shall be accused of hustling H/C. in order to get to B’mouth.



R.A.B.	Measures:  i) Statement (by P.M. on defence – redn. of man-power.  [Improvemt. in Army pay wd. have to wait until Estimates.] 

ii)  Housing.  Proposals in pp. circulated.  Main diffce. of opinion is tht. I want to announce new subsidy figures.  But we must forecast intention to deal with rent de-control (tho’ Scotland will have to follow a year later).  An important &amp; diff. manoeuvre. 

iii) Other expenditure of l.a.’s.  Objns.  qua education and hospitals.  Don’t want to exclude fr. circular any Dpt. interest.  Circular gives latitude to l.a.’s to decide how to arrange their cuts.  Hope to reach agreemt. with Ministers concerned with these expenditures.

iv)  L.A. finance : methods.  Carrying them on Exchequer below the line is out of date.  Larger l.a.’s shd. stand on own credit not on ours.  Will help credit squeeze on private sector.  

v)   Investment by natd. indies.  Statements on electricity &amp; gas.  

vi)  Bread.  M/Ag. wants subsidy abolished : it is unsound.  	Propose we abolish it, but allow off-setting increase in N.A. scales. e.g. 2/6 &amp; 4/= increase – wh. is likely anyway : wd. cost £3 M. more to do it now.  vii) Savings.  New 4% Def. Bond, with same premium as for existing 3½% with 3 mos. vice 6 mos. notice for encashment.  Modification on deposits (?).

viii)Tourism.  Redn. to £75 wd. save £3 M.  Ready to do this, if Cab. so desire. 

ix)  Purchase tax.  Only immedte. way of reducg. pressure of home demand.  Triple manoeuvre : a) remove D. Scheme to encourage quality prodn., and instead sales tax of 5% on woollen cloth.  Socialists will say it is regressive.  A. &amp; N.Z. are going to re-impose import restns. (because of their inflation) : and our textile indies. will need help with quality prodn.

b)  Increase of all rates fr. 50% to 60%.

c) Bring in domestic articles (pots &amp; pans.)

	Together, these changes wd. yield £75 M. 

x)   Tax on distributed profits : 30% instead of 22.5%.  Can find no other way of curbing excessive profits.  Industry got £70 – £80 M by abolition of E.P.L.  Tho’ this wd. put profits tax back to 1952, there have bn. 2 income tax redns. m’while.  Will deflate Stock Exchange boom.  Yield : £60 M.

Weakness : no certainty of redn. of Govt. exp’re save on bread subsidy.  That is reason for incldg. latter.

Measures wd. be welcomed by economists here &amp; abroad &amp; instructed public opinion.

Anxious about keeping such a package on ice for a month.  We cd. get it thro’ now.



H.C.	Only (ix) and (x) need Parly. action.  Rest cd. be done w’out it.



R.A.B.	This p.y. opn. cdn’t be done, decently, by Order.  Parlt. wd. wish to be recalled.  Also for housing announcement, because of politics.



D.S.	But unwise to announce figures of subsidy cut before I can talk to l.a.’s  Grave risk of announcg. w’out consultn.

	Tho’ I will sound warning note about housing finance in a speech to A.M.C. at Harrogate to-morrow.  L.a.’s are thinking of increased subsidies.

	Shall meet l.a.’s on 3/10.



P.T.	Commercially – much to be said for early announcemt. of all measures.  We can’t go on with 90% liberalisn.

	Also v. embarrassing to hold Party Confce. w’out having said this. Package : can’t announce save simultaneously.

	Oppn. wd. demand recall if we announced some of these measures.



K.	Malta Conference : wdn’t be able to meet much next week : &amp; in followg. wks.  2 Party Confces.  Malta won’t be able to make much progress : Labour members will complain of that.



W.M.	Package : can’t defend it so easily w’out (x).  Better therefore to recall Parlt.

Bread subsidy.  T.U. Congress : 1952 attack on subsidies is still resented.  This will poison package, fr. my angle.  Recognise tht. I have always opposed it, &amp; tht. large wage increases have in event bn. obtained.  But there are Labour leaders who do wish to urge wage restraint – and they may well be alienated by this.



O.P.	This will drive Ass. Bd. to ask for increase in scales.  That is not inevitable otherwise.  We have succeeded in reducg. by 200,000 the nos. on assistce. because we have got N.I. rates higher.  Increase in Ass. scales will undo all this good work.  Reproach : steady increase of nos. on assistce.  

Am circulatg. memo. – hope it may be taken into a/c before decn. taken on bread.



RAB.	1.33 points on c/living index : bread.

	1 point        ..        ..         ..     : p. tax changes.



W.	Recall of Parlt. will create biggest crisis we have had.  We have boasted of avoiding crises.  Will it not damage confidence.

	Shd. have to reconsider handling of Party Conference.



P.M.	Include Tourism.  Then it is balanced.  Unwise to divide it.

	Bread is most diff. ques.  If we don’t do it now, shall we ever?  But see force of W.M.’s remarks re effect on T.U.’s – who have given us as much support as we cd. have expected.  Also its effect on wage demands thro’ increase in c/living.

	Parlt. Choice is recall now, or one week before date arranged.



L.P.	Substance : Housing changes v. important &amp; essential.

	In view of that, I wd. drop bread proposal – i.e. because housing is even more important. (incldg. decontrol of rents, which I think important to start on).

	Tourism.  Travellers nowadays are not the rich.  But I wdn’t mind much, one way or another.

	Atomic Power.  Plowden thinks we cd. accelerate p’mme. 

	L.A. expenditure.  Is circular fair – in leaving so little lead on what Govt. expect them to do.  Flexibility may be a little over-done.  Some more guidance is needed?

	Timing.  How disastrous to delay until 18/10., viz., another 3 wks.  V. embarrassing to recall now.



P.M.	Turns on impact of Sept. figures.



S.Ll.	Just before Party Confce. – w’out any announcement of Govt. intentions.



D.S.	Cd. you not on 3/10 announce tht. Parlt. wd. assemble a week earlier than arranged – because of addl. measures to be taken.



P.M.	I wd. announce that before Sept. figures come out.

	RAB’s speech at Istanbul had steadying effect.  If RAB. did it again in speech on 4/10., wd. not that hold it.



D.S.	If this Cab. is followed by recall next Tues. will give impn. of undue gravity.



H.M.	V. evenly balanced.  Will create crisis atmosphere.  But worse criticism tht. (as with Gaitskell) you knew &amp; did nil. Can R.A.B. reconcile himself to inaction?  Or does he feel that action ought not to be p’poned.

	Measures will have no immediate effect, save on confidence.  Ques therefore is : is statement necessary, qua confidence, next week or in 3 weeks.



S.Ll.	Announce them all : &amp; say that on this a/c Parlt. will meet one week earlier.



D.E.	Trends (of figures) are known to those who influence “confidence”.  Important not to delay announcement.

	Education (not heard).



J.S.	This is a big package.  Will be regarded as serious.  May shake confidence still further.  Shall we get Parlt. to go away if we get them back.  Wd. prefer tht. Parlt. shd. meet on 18/10.



L.P.	Cdn’t R.A.B. give warning on 4/10., &amp; declare Govt.’s intentn. to deal firmly with situation.



R.A.B.	If we went on now, believe we shd. win.  We shd. do this, quickly, and all at once.  Diff. to hold it for a month.  Can’t untie this package.  Can’t say much until we can announce definite measures.

M/D. suggn. tht. we cd. announce intentn. in advance.  There are precedents for this (profits tax &amp; p. tax);  but wd. provoke demand for recall of Parlt.



P.M.	If we don’t recall next week, announcement of earlier recall (Oct) shd. be made on 1st. or 3rd. Oct., before R.A.B. speaks at G’hall.



R.A.B.	Cd. we add : there will be autumn budget.





		2.	International Bank and Fund.



	a)	Relations with U.S.



R.A.B.	Humphrey is strong Protectionist.  Wants to shut down on foreign aid.  In answer to our diffies. he said “you must do whatever you need to protect yourselves.”  We have therefore dropped previous undertakg. to abandon discriminn. w’in 12 mos. of going convertible.  

Harcourt thinks Anglo-U.S. economic relns. in diff. condition.  We shd. not therefore bombard them with recriminations.  On Joseph Dam we shd. not publish our protest, for time being.

	Send off another tel. now in machine.  

Also one on oil.  But leave it to R.M. to handle it : avoid too much emotion.  Things are tricky.



	b)	Commonwealth.



R.A.B.	Asked Dom. repves. wtr in view of U.S. attitude, they wd. wish to reverse the multilateral policy.  They all said “no” : but take it more slowly.  Canada in end, persuaded tht. we intend only to take it slowly.

A. &amp; N.Z. import restns. are tiresome : but believe they will do their best on textiles.

								[Enter Nugent.



		3.	United States Fruit.



R.A.B.	Take $19 m. worth of non-citrus : but no free dollars.

	$4.5 m. citrus, of which not more than 1 m. for fresh grapefruit.

	$½ m. only for canned : &amp; up to Dec. : &amp; consult Colonies.



A.L.B.	Diffies. with W. Indies over bananas etc.,  We shall have more diffy. if we go ahead on citrus w’out consultg. them.  I must have chance to get their reactions.  Talks with them are due on price support.

	Have put my diffies. to R.A.B. &amp; draft of telegram to W.Indies – suggesting another mtg. betwn. W. Indies &amp; Florida growers to find some method wh is w’in the U.S. law.  Can’t accept (d) until I have consulted W. Indies.



P.M.	Much concerned at Col. sitn. generally.  Can’t afford more economic diffy. in W. Indies.



A.L.B.	I can’t hope for agreement on price assistance scheme if I have to start with disclosg. a give away on U.S. canned g. fruit.



P.T.	This is all aid : no free dollars.

	Suggest mtg with RAB., ALB., P.T.



N.	Carry-over of what we didn’t spend last year.  U.S. put v. gt. stress on the canned fruit.



A.L.B.	Trifle to them : life &amp; death to W.Indies.



W.	It is U.S. interest, not ours, to have this on our market.



Agreed : 	RAB., P.T. &amp; ALB. to consider another way out – Junior Ministers.



							[Exit Nugent.

		4.	G.A.T.T.



		Memo. approved.





		5.	Cyprus.



A.L.B.	I want Bishop out of Cyprus &amp; out of Athens Radio.

	But I also want Cyprus not inscribed on U.N. Agenda.  Was ready therefore to wait until F.O. knew U.S. attitude on latter.



H.M.	Dulles’ reply was better than I expected.  He will support us.  Looks therefore as if Genl. Cttee. will vote v. inscriptn. on agenda, on ground tht. discn. wd. be inappropriate.  6 votes known against : 3 for : doubtful 6.  Pressing those, now, on basis tht. U.S. agree with our view.  Decn. will be taken 8 a.m. today recommn. &amp; will come to Plenary Session on Friday.  Result will be known then.

	Advise therefore that we shd. wait until after Friday before arresting the Bishop.
