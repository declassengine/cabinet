C.M. 48(56). 11th July, 1956.

1. East-West Trade : China. [Enter E.H.

S.Ll. Cocom ends this week. Told U.S. we wd. deal with these on principle – shd. not be on China list because not on R. list. Have received formal aide-memoire fr. U.S. Govt. m’taing. tht. proposal is inconsistent with our earlier statements of policy &amp; dangerous to f. aid p’mme. Maintains tht. Land Rover is a strategic article. Gives notice of U.S. oppn. in China Cttee.

Suggest we ask Cocom to approve shipment of 2 specific orders – 50 odd Land Rovers and 15 tractors. Say we shall do this on quid pro quo basis : state of car industry : risk tht., if we don’t supply, Czechs will.

If U.S. protest, our repve. can report back.

P.T. Risk that further delay will lose us the order.

P.M. Posn generally is becoming untenable.

P.T. Both these are sold unlimited to R. bloc. Rovers are on short-time.

P.M. Pres. agreed Feb. tht. it was reasonable to equate Soviet &amp; Ch. lists. Mentioned in communiqué.

If we truckle to U.S. on this, it will be known &amp; anti-U.S. feeling in car industry will be v. likely.

S.Ll. R.M. makes it clear tht. it is pol. pressure in W’ton, not reason, that is influencg. State Dpt.

2. Nuclear Weapons : Tests.

S.Ll. P.Q.’s to-day &amp; to-morrow. Shall be pressed to say wtr we will take initiative. Disarm. Commn. considerg. U.S. will accept a form of words on limitn. of tests : but only w’in framework of genl. agreemt. We shd. offer discn. outside that context.

P.M. Agree.

3. Bahrain.

S.Ll. Indicns. by Belgrave tht. he has no intn. of going have marred our plan. Do we ride out a strike? Or do we seek to persuade Ruler to make some statement indicatg. B.’s retirement will not be delayed beyond a matter of months.

S. Para. 3 of Tel. might meet case, if no announcemt. has yet bn. made.

56

P.M. For last words substitute “towards end of year” – or say nothing on date.

S. Announcement (vice talks to Cttee.) wd. be less likely to appear that we were giving way to pressure.

P.M. Yes : don’t “negotiate” it with anyone.

Agreed : S.Ll. to consider in light of discussion.

4. Parliament. [Enter Att.G.

E.H. Business for next week.

F. Affairs debate on Mon/Tues. of followg. week. Defence debate in final week.

Various Supply Days next week : but fr. Govt. angle preferable tht. Cyprus shd. be dealt with in F. Affairs debate.

Debate on Members’ Remuneration : If L.P.S. unwell, P.M. to speak early in debate. Cd. not reply because public dinner. Ll. G. to do this.

5. Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill.

P.M. Silverman wants to ask P.N. Ques to-day. Speaker won’t allow it. But Silverman will get his chance to put the point on Business on Thursday. He will then ask for statement of Govt. policy.

S. Last week Cttee. considg. Att. G.’s idea tht. Govt. shd. promote next session a Bill to alter law of murder &amp; shd. then put on Whips against Silverman’s Bill if brght fwd. We were then against this. But now Samuel &amp; Cantuar have asked us to promote such legn. – and request put in moderate terms. Good case for putting c.p. on a basis which wd. command wider support. We have chance to re-capture initiative. This mght also recover support of some Govt. supporters who voted with Silverman. A better posn. than a purely negative attitude.

K. Agree with this view. In Motion we offered to amend law. With hard work in Sept. we cd. produce Bill – introduce in Lords.

Take a Govt. line on this basis.

P.M. Is it practicable? I agree it’s good tactics.

Ll.G. We did advocate it as alternative to abolition. We shd. do our best to achieve it. Agree we shd. start it in H/L. Agree it wd. be a good face-saver for some Tories who voted with Silverman.

P.M. Shd. we be revertg. to posn. wh. H/C. rejected. x/ Any addl. amendmts?

57

D.S. H/L. debate is a new factor.

J.S. Govt. shd. now take initiative. Responsibility shd. now be assumed by Govt.

K. On x/ : we only offered to consider constructive malice &amp; limited responsibility. I think we shd. now say we wd. deal with these. We can find a way thro’ diffies.

Att.G. Follow up also suggn. tht. we shd. exclude more of the cases wh. are now reprieved.

H.M. Find a formula for to-morrow wh. will give us time to study. Nothing can be done this session. If we are to use Whips we must know we can carry it before we get committed.

H. But aim at statement before end of Session.

D.S. } Better, if we do have a Govt. Bill, to start it in H.C. Rather dangerous,

H.M. } qua attitude of H/C., to start it in H/L.

Ll.G. Bound to be asked to-morrow what facilities Govt. will give to S.’s Bill in next session.

H.M. No oblign. to do so. But wd. have to give it time.

K. Parlt. Act doesn’t affect procedure in H/C., as regards time.

H.A. Indicated assent to project for govt. Bill.

But study possibility of adding more than the 4 points.

I.M. Implicit in this is decision to put Whips on against abolition. That I cdn’t accept, for myself. Possibly other Ministers who abstained mght feel the same. If Govt. Bill commanded enough support, it is conceivable tht. Govt. wd. think it safe to allow same free vote as before on an abolition Bill.

S. Somethg. to be said for introducg. Govt. Bill in H/L. this session even tho’ it cdn’t pass into law. Wd. show positively what H/L. are prepd. to accept.

Wd. begin by discussg. privately with Samuel &amp; Cantuar to see what they wd. accept.

H.M. Alternative procedure of Resolns: instead of farce of a Bill wh. can’t pass. This is traditional procedure. Mght even do it in H/C. to test opinion.

Agreed: Ll.G., K., Att. G. and J.S. &amp; Ld. Advocate to submit

memo. on form of a Govt. Bill.

58

S. to take sounding with Samuel &amp; Cantuar.

M’while in H/C. offer to make statement in course of

this session, and hope before recess. (K : because of

importce. of regaining initiative.)

[Enter A.H. N.B.

6. Armed Forces: Conditions of Service in Germany.

H.M. Saving of only £1 M. – offset by increased wages to Germans. Means Suppl. Estimate of £34 M. odd.

i) Rations. Relic of occupn. I want to defer inevitable change until end of financial year.

ii) Batmen. I suggest U.K. scale.

iii) Domestic servants. I suggest ⅔rds.for remainder of this year and be then w’drawn.

A.H. We have saved £5 M. – an earlier result of £4 M from a w. party with Ty.

Wd. sooner save by reducg. nos.

i) Rations. Wd. accept the delay if I can have concessions elsewhere. Local overseas allowance wd. cover i) and iii) : not given h’to in Germany because occupn.

ii) Batmen : Major has only ¼ batman. Lt Col. only ½ batman. Pretty austere. And in all overseas stations it has bn. offset by allowance for domestic servants – which U.S. &amp; Fr. have. If we deprive them of the service, we must give them money to buy it.

My offer : accept H.M.’s view on i) and ii) if I can have allowance for iii) included in l.o.a. – subject to review when we can review numbers. £750.000 until then

Agreed. [Exit A.H., N.B.

7. Cyprus.

A.L.B. Harding supports statement in amended form.

Radcliffe wd. go to Cyprus on Friday.

Statement in these terms wd. be made by P.M. on Thursday.

E.H. Para. 4. Tories may feel tht. this puts too much blame on Turks.

A.L.B. But this is main reason why we can’t go on with this. H.M. Amb. Ankara has advised tht. T. wdn’t object to this.

S. Meet this by amendment noted in ms. on my text. Agreed.

P.M. Shall decline to disclose details of negotn. – on basis tht. publn. wd. freeze posn.for all time.

59

A.L.B. I still believe we shall be forced to publish because w’spread leakages of all parts save those wh. wd. re-assure Tories. That is my view : but it’s a matter of tactics, not principle.

P.M. Reason to fear tht. U.S. Govt. are going to give whole story to N. Yk. Times. May have to re-consider.

P.T. Somethg. to be said for makg. our own statement, with full argument.

P.M. Offl. statement wd. freeze posn. more than publn. by N. Yk. Times.

S.Ll. May help us with Tories if N. Yk. Times publish.

H. Plan wd. not be universally welcomed – e.g. in Canada there wd. be criticism.

E.H. Considerable section of Tories, not merely extreme right wing, wd. not be re-assured by publn. of plan.

Agreed : Statement on Thurs. in both Houses (S. in H/Lds.)

8. Remuneration of Members.

E.H. i) Shd. we say we don’t exlude Ty. contn. to Members’ Fund if need arises Agreed.

ii) Enquiry : R.A.B. wd. have preferred not to close door to this wholly.

J.S. I’m against it : undignified.

P.M. Wd. sooner settle it in Parlt.

E.H. iii) Time for concession. No indicn. to be given. Agreed.

For spokesmen – see Parliament. Minute 4 above.

[Exit E.H.

9. Wales : Rural Areas.

Ll.G. Life can’t be supported on many of these small-holdings.

H.A. This is only line we cd. take.

H.M. Applaud this.

Agreed.

10. Colonial Immigrants.

60

K. As in memo.

S. No logical reason for p’ponement. It may get worse.

I.M. No of unemployed coloured is now over 5% – doubled – much higher (4 or 5 times) than natl. average. Must assume it will increase.

A.L.B. May lead to slackening of immigration.

Endorse para. 23. But Ld. Lloyd wd. support S.’s view.

Rate of immigrn. : 16.000 last year + 14.000 in first half of ’56. These figures exclude Asians.

x| Suggest I tell Manley &amp; Grantley Adams, seriously, about unemplt. situation. (Jamaica &amp; Barbados).

I.M. Not discrimin. v. blacks. Result of last in, first out.

A.L.B. Many Indians : 1.000 p. month by air for settlement in U.K.

D.E. If we have to do this, by legn., sooner wd. be better than later electorally.

S. Cd. you regulate it by tempy. labour permits.

P.M. x/ : in discn., not by letter. Watch sitn: no decn. to p’pone for a year. At least, review in autumn.

Report on legn. re Eire.

11. Marketing of Pigs and Bacon.

H.A. May we publish report? Govt. not committed thereby.

Agreed.

12. Nigeria.

A.L-B. P.M. of E. Nigeria. Irregular connns. with his Bank. He has now bn. censured in Legve. Assembly : Spker. ruled it out of order : P.M. then took libel action v. former Ch. Whip.

Is he to come to Sept. Confce. Oppn. won’t agree unless his honour is previously cleared.

Propose therefore to appoint Commn. to enquire – giving him chance first to ask for it.
