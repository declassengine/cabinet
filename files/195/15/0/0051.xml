C.M. 89(56). 27th November, 1956.

1. Suez Canal [Enter 3 Serv. Ministers, H.W., A.N., E.H.

RAB. Tels. 1416 &amp; 1417.

Statement in H/C. Thurs. seems inevitable.

Informn. fr. Fr. source : E. oil is running out – losses in Sinai concealed – risk of unrest – riots may imperil Br. lives.

Tels. fr. Bagdad : 1476, 1485, 1488. Nuri under gt. pol. pressure, which he may relieve by rationalising I.P.C., at expense of French &amp; Gulbenk.

W.M. Visit to Port Said. Drove round. No sign of hostility – or enthusiasm. Then flew over areas covered by fighting. Destructn. comparatively slight. Two areas : one centre of heavy resistance, overcome by tanks : the other, the Arab quarter where a good deal of damage by fire. Also some damage on sea-front. Photographs bear out this a/c.

Casualties : we have commd. ourselves to estimate of 100-200. Doubt if we can substantiate this. Most wd. have occurred on 2nd. day. But Butler estimates tht. on 1st. day his men &amp; French killed 200 – incldg 35 civilians. Register in Arabic in hospital shows total of 700 odd buried : suspect because pages missing. Neutrals suggest 1000 or 2000 killed &amp; similar wounded. But 540 wounded seems reasonable – and, if so, killed wd. not amount to 1.000. Some hundreds seems most reliable estimate.

Sniping. Soldiers threw away uniforms &amp; fought on in civilian clothes. Also much indiscriminate arming of civilians.

Neutrals seem apt to accept high figures. Possibility : enquiry by military court.

Hail. Normal ratio of killed to wounded = 1 : 4 or 5. If wounded were 500 odd, suggests 100 or so killed.

R.A.B. We have agreed in principle to admission of U.N. observers.

Hail. Report that Marine, son of Labour M.P., had written admittg. looting.

W.M. Cd. find no confirmn. of that story. There was looting, but mostly by Egyptians.

R.A.B. Risk of further resolns. in U.N. In that event, swing beginning in U.S. twds. us will be checked. Also opinion in Doms. And we shall not have strengthened posn. of U.N.

A.H. Location of U.N. force. Little risk of its leaving Canal for frontier because can’t move.

197

H.W. Firm arrangemt. on clearance wd. improve our posn. here, esp. with business interests. Wd. accept v. quick w’drawal in return for that.

R.A.B. Must try to get dependent on U.N. rather than on Nasser.

E.H. Back-bench motion with anti-U.S. flavour &amp; amendment may go down on Order Paper.

Hail. Shd. we not try to delay this for 2-3 days.

P.T. Certainly : Party shd. not publicly divide itself before Govt. policy announced.

Good reason for delay : wait until S.Ll. returns. [Exit Ch. Whip –

R.A.B. Indications that U.S. policy may be about to veer round a little.

H.M. Must get off the hook, in such a way as not to break the Party. Want to do so, if poss., before my statement on Tues. – by wh. time I want to have secured Humphrey’s support for measures to support £.

P.T. We aren’t only people on a hook. Nasser is in diffies. State [Enter L.P.

Dpt. must be under growing pressure to abandon [Re-enter E.H.

posn. of siding with Syria &amp; Egypt.

Confidence in sterling – more likely to be restored by harsh internal measures than by drawing on I.M.F.

Wd. not therefore wish to close my mind until S.Ll. returns.

A.H. Wish we cd. get more informn. re condns. in E.?

A.N. Seeking it – fr. Br. subjects returning.

Hail. Oil in Pt. Said – 100.000 t. Am takg 20.000 t. belonging to Admy. Can’t get Shell to move their 80.000 t.

L.P. Cd. we recover Br. tankers on bare-boat charter to U.S. oil companies – a) to prevent them being used to put oil into Suez for Egypt.

b) to secure control over them for our own purposes.

D.E. Party won’t accept w’drawal unless we are able to say we have got somethg out of the operation.

RAB Gt. need is to re-establish reality of Anglo-U.S. alliance – to counter R. threat in M/E, north &amp; south.

More publicity for our destruction of Soviet war material in E.

L.P. We must include in the package some provn. for protection of Br. nationals in E. For we can’t contemplate w’drawing our troops at moment of greatest danger to our nationals.

198

H. Shd. we not organise facilities for their evacuation thro’ a [Enter H.A.

neutral Power.

A.H. Shd. C-in-C. continue to forfeit his ability to break out of Pt. Said?

R.A.B. U.N. forces are now in the way.
