C.M. 51 (56) 20th July, 1956

1. Australia : Trade Talks. [Enter E.H.

P.M. Apart fr. merits, diff. presentn. A want somethg. to take home, &amp; imposs. evolve anythg definite in time available.

P.T. If we are to get agreemt. giving us some guaranteed preferences, we shall have to give somethg. on wheat. Diffies. of this in M/Ag. memo.

Time-factor. Can’t do more than agree to reach some agreemt. Recognise need for them to re-enter U.K. market for wheat &amp; are examing. methods. Draft communiqué being prepd.on these lines.

H.A. Realise importce. of this. Sorry to make trouble over 40m. bushels wheat. But v. real diffies. Mustn’t commit ourselves. Don’t go beyond saying we are trying to find a method.

The importce. they attach to wheat is pol. rather than economic. Austr. Wheat Bd. attach much less importce. than A. Ministers to getting firm U.K. market.

Want 6 wks. to study. All we cd. say now is tht. we wd. use our good offices to secure sale of A. wheat in U.K. Can’t go beyond that w’out consultn. with trade &amp; farmers.

H.M. By one form or another we must seek soln. of A. problem arising from loss of 50% of their pre-war exports to U.K. They want another £10M sales of wheat. Agreemt. wh. makes clear tht. we will do this tho’ no commitmt. to method. He may accept posn. if we give sincere assurce. tht. we really mean to secure entry of this wheat into U.K. market.

P.M. Guiding principles: i) No action at expense of our own farmers. Sudden switch away fr. cereals wd. damage out standing with them. A. have recognised this.

ii) Choice of method. My preference is for (iii) want to take A. wheat in preference to Argentine &amp; France.

iii) How play the hand? If we give anything definite on wheat now, they will be tempted to w’draw latest offer on preferences. We must hang on to our bargaining posn. over the preferences.

H.A. Total imports 41/2 m. tons of wh. 2.7m. tons is soft or medium. 5 or 6.00,000 t. Austr. wheat. Same from France. 1/2m. tons of medium fr. U.S. 400.000 t. from Argentine. Room therefore for 500.000 t. of A. wheat if we can find a method.

H.M. Because we aren’t in I.W.A., we can buy below cartel price. A. complain tht. Fr. &amp; Argentine undercut their price by subsidy. If we make specl. arrangemt., N.Z. may want same : we may be 70

setting a pattern – preventg. us from gaining advantage of cheap food. Big ques of commercial policy is wtr we can gain off-setting advantages for keeping our c/l. a little higher on a/c of dear food and our costs in consequence a little higher than some of competitors.

This is why we can’t finish negotn. at once. An agreement to find a means to agree.

Ll.G. Advise caution. Recall reasons for leaving I.W.A. They were askg. 1.25 cents when we cd. buy at .98 : and wdn’t come below 1.05. This sort of deal with producers can be v. costly. We have done v. well by being out of I.W.A.

P.T. Produced draft communiqué.

Agreed – subject to amendments.

[Enter Att.G.

2. Aswan Dam.

S.Ll. Dulles’ statement y’day. All has gone as we wished. He has acted suddenly in order to anticipate Senate debate.

When do we announce a similar decision? At F.O. Press Conference this a.m.? Wd. mean we shdn’t be able to tell Egyptn. Govt. first. Don’t want, however, to say we are considerg. in lght of U.S. announcemt.

P.T. Need we be so hasty. U.K. firms were interested. Shd. have time to consider their posn.

S. U.S. have done what we wanted. Don’t give impn. we are shilly-shallying.

H.M. We shall be saying only we won’t put money into it. Wdn’t prevent firms going on.

S. Sums involved are such tht. it cdn’t be done w’out internatl. finance.

P.T. Accept need for early statement, but confine it to HMG.’s participation.

Agreed.

3. Capital Punishment.

K. Para. 2. We believe this to be practicable. Some diffies. over diminished responsibility, but can be made to work.

Para. 4. We agree on 5 categories specified.

Para. 5. On poisoning we cdn’t agree.

71

[Annex : 14.6 executed: wd. be 6.9 under new system proposed.] Basis &amp; logic of our plan is minimum requd. for preservn. of law and order. My view : exclude (?) poisoning because need to secure sufficient support.

P.M. If poisoning were excluded, easier to exclude (b).

K. But (b) wd. cover I.RA. type of case.

J.S. Also implies pre-meditn. – arming oneself.

S. Seen Cantuar. Accepts need of c.p. as deterrent. Quite firm on that. But wants clear definition of categories ………

K. Must avoid moral criterion – too difficult.

K. Want Judges to be sounded while Ch. Whip sounds M.P.’s.

Timing. Reslon. at Party Confce. From that angle better to make statement before Recess.

Ll.G. Cdn’t make detailed statement – because anticipn. of Q. speech.

P.M. Gaitskell’s line : irrespective of a Govt. Bill, we insist tht. Parlt. Act facilities be given for Silverman’s Bill.

W.M. Poisoning : particularly shocking. Awkward to exclude it. On the other hand, not many are executed.

H.A. A logical line to draw wd. be premeditation. That wd. bring in poisoners. Leave mercy-killers to be dealt with by reprieve.

Att.G. You can’t define premeditated murders. (b) gets at it by a diff. route.

Favour incldg. poisoning among categories. Cd. test opinion on it.

I.M. This plan wd. suffice to attract main bulk of Tory abolitionists. But is there any logic in anything between total retentn. or total abolition.

Agreed : K. to discuss with Cab. members not on his Cttee.

Adjourn decision until Tuesday.

4. N.A.T.O. Re-appraisal of Military Policy. [Exit Att.G.

Proposed U.S. Statement.

We can assent. But make no corresponding statement ourselves.

5. Cyprus.

72

B’casts from Cairo. Monitor only. No jamming at present.

6. Nuclear Weapons : Tests.

P.M. Wd. like a scheme of internatl. limitn. of tests to be prepared wh. we cd. discuss with U.S.

S. Diff. for us to know yet how many tests we shall need to make.

P.M. At least let us put some work in hand on the problem of limitn.

S.Ll. Strongly support this view. We can’t hold p. opinion for long. Shd. we take initiative in askg. U.S. &amp; R. for views.

P.M. Don’t go as far as that now. Let’s work out some scheme.

Agreed : F.O. to initiate interdepartmental study.

S. Publicity i) make it clear we test not for prestige, but to make sure our bombs will work.

ii) distinguish betwn. limitn. and prohibition of tests.

7. Malta.

W.M. Memo of 17/6 on M/E. dealt with Malta. Will ask them if they have anything more to say.

A.L.B. Equivalence : stand firm on this.

Electoral reform. Wd. suit him. Can’t alter it in advance of Genl. Election. Wd. sooner break with Mintoff on that rather than on finance.

8. Aden.

A.L.B. Circd. for informn.

Para. 6. Jiffris. Have discussed with K. &amp; L.O.’s &amp; have put a different suggn. to Govr. A law of Colony enabling a man to be put on bond &amp; dealt with if it is breached. That law cd. be extended by O-in-C. to Protectorate.
