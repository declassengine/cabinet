M’while Govr. must return. Must therefore be immediate statement : draft B.

H.M. Draft A. goes too far in suggesting T. veto.

13. Police Pay.

Ll.G. P.Q. to-day by Ede. Proposed answer: no powers, but considg. what can be done to resolve diffies. Cd. avoid repercussions on teachers &amp; pensions by bringing Police procedure into line with others. Cdn’t go as far as firemen or Civil Service w’out much greater difficulty.
