C.M. 43 (56) 14th June, 1956 5.p.m.

1. Government Expenditure : Economies.

D.E. Education. Social Services Sub-Cttee. considered various alternatives. Tried to give relief to larger families, but cdn’t secure it. Actual cost is now about 10d. Increase to 1/- wd. therefore deviate fr. past practice tht. parents shd. not pay more than cost of food. But I doubt if parents will make bones over 1/= vice 10d. : nor do I think that drop in nos. will be significant. Our party does expect some offset to other increasg. costs of educn.

R.A.B. Sub-Cttee. agreed to this – if “absolutely essential” to get the £100M. Believe choice is betwn. this &amp; prescription charges. Latter wd. bring in less money &amp; give more trouble with pensioners than this will with parents.

Not a great social grievance to raise to 1/=. Save for f. allowances point. I am ready to support it, however.

J.S. Tho’ in Education Vote this is a health measure. Politically, it’s awkward. Taking it out of the kids. Have defended earlier increase on basis tht. we wdn’t charge more than cost of food. Good service : of gt. benefit to children : esp. in rural areas : bound to be a drop in nos.

B.C. Linked with F. allowances. Awkward therefore to do this just when we are increasg. f. allowances – esp. for larger families, which are dropping below proper diet. Bill gives £5.4.0. : this wd. take away £7.4.0. Looks v. inconsistent. Will increase pressure for increasg. f. allowances to 2nd. child or even for giving it to the 1st.

P.M. Saw Executive of 1922 this p.m. Asked me if we wd. get thro’ on existg. policies : wtr we needed controls. Told them we cd. manage it if economies secured. They were most anxious to see big cuts in defence : even on matters where economy wd. only come in next year. Esp. for relief on industry.

P.T. Better to cut back still further on bldg. – throughout s. service p’mmes. Wd. give more relief to industry.

H.M. Cut out the capital exp’re on school meals and increase price to 10d. (or actual cost). Agreed.

Go back on this, if other figures drop. [Exit D.E.

Colonies.

A.L.B. Kenya. Loan of £2 M.

But new expenditure of £400.000 is being borne by Kenya.

Ready to ask them to take loan of £1½ M. vice 2 M. Will put it firmly to them.

33

On C.D. &amp; W. territories have fixed p’mmes which they have announced. But ready to say £17¼ M. is maximum demand on Exchequer for this. Subject to formula put in.

H.M. Accept this – at £1¼ M. in all.

Overseas Information.

S.Ll. Gt. pressure to extend these services.

40% is on B.B.C. services [Cd. abolish Europ. language service, in acc. with Drogheda Rpt.] General overseas service in English cd. not however be scrapped w’out outcry.

Shall have to sell this as redeployment.

Hope therefore H.M. will wait for my general memo. on this.

S. Inconsistent with our re-orientation of policy to cut down on this blindly. If risk of hot war has receded, more need for effort in cold.

S.Ll. ⅓rd. of £1¼ M. might come from []. Not more than £½ M.

H.M. to discuss with S.Ll. [Exit J.S.

Conclusion: Might total £71½ or £72 M.

H.E. Will be diffes. in H/C. because £100 M. hasn’t been realised. Oppn. will make the most of it.

Impn. in Party tht. the £100 M. was to be in addn. to b &amp; milk.

S.Ll. Consider not starting any more new Valiants.

W.M. to discuss with C.A.S. &amp; R.M.

Also possibility of selling aircraft abroad.

E.H. With £85 M. now &amp; good prospect of a 2nd. instalment in autumn we might be all right.
