C.M. 86(56). 21st November, l956.

Suez Canal.

R.A.B. Summarised messages from S.Ll. in N. York – 1315, 1322.

I.K. U.N. resolutions. We are in breach of one, for not w’drawing. E. is in breach of the other for obstructg. clearance of Canal. On the whole U.N. will attach more importance (sentiment) to first than to second (practical).

P.T. Cd. we not offer an agreement tying, in time, stages of w’drawal to stages of salvage clearance.

H. Mustn’t appear to be pushed. Must get agreemt. on phased w’drawal e.g. 2 battns. of ours for one of theirs + promise that salvage will begin when U.N. forces are in majority.

D.S. No guarantee here of final settlement.

H.M. We &amp; Fr. alone have not power to carry on for long. This is moment at wh. to transfer main responsibilities to U.N.

H.A. Support this view. S.Ll. has achieved much. Both sides are in breach of U.N. resolns. Say we are ready for phased w’drawal : want also phased progress with salvage : one need not be linked with another.

K. Answer to I.K.’s point : U.N. force was a new factor : since it was offered, we have bn. ready to co-operate with it &amp; do a phased w’drawal. Our objective now must be to divert U.N. antipathy on Nasser. As regds. our diffy. in U.K., don’t forget what we have achieved : stopped E/I. war : prevented it spreading : Bagdad Pact Powers have now seen R. danger behind Nasser. By playing these cards, we shd. be able to bring U.K. opinion along.

I.M. Stress our clearance of Pt. Said.

Go for U.S. involvement in M/E – thro’ Bagdad Pact.

RAB. Announcemt. re our clearance of Pt. Said. Let S.Ll. have first go with this &amp; follow up with publicity in U.K. thereafter.

E.H. Movement among Suez group : opposed to w’drawal until Canal cleared, settlement for future made &amp; progress twds Arab/Israel settlement. This will be awkward.

Similar repns. from Poole re feeling in country.

R.A.B. This feeling based on rumours of H.’s report which have not bn. substantiated.

2. Parliament.

Business for next week.
