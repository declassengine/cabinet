C.M. 98(56). 11th December, 1956.

1. Cyprus. [Enter A.N., R., P.M.G., Gosford., H.Brooke, E.H.

A.L.B. C. Policy Cttee. have considered Radcliffe Rpt., with aid of Govr. &amp; Ambassadors to Greece &amp; Turkey. Financial ques wh. Cttee. failed to settle have now bn. determined, in consultn. with Ty.

Statement – to be made in H/C. on Wed. next. Rpt. to be publd. that day here &amp; locally.

Proposed tht. I shd. visit G &amp; T. in person to secure their acquiescence.

R.A.B. P.M. has bn. informed. Announcemt. can’t be delayed. Wd. have bn. better tht. A.L.B. shd. do his consultns. in Paris : but have warned P.M. tht. he may need to go to the 2 capitals.

L.P. Cttee. approved all main recommns. of R.’s report – &amp; agreed tht. it shd. be taken as a whole.

Most important to publish report before Xmas.

Statement : i) para. on partition. Included to make it poss. for G. &amp; T. to give the plan a modified blessing. Not actually a solution wh. we wd. welcome – &amp; probably impracticable for some time on strategic grounds.

ii) para. referring to Makarios. Wd. be taken as sign of weakness by our supporters if we volunteered this. Better reserved for reply to supplementary.

Rpt. is most valuable – and wd. be useful precedent.

A.L.B. Financial decisions. Police £1 M from Col. Funds : excess over next 5 years from Treasury.

Inter-communal Schools. Cyprus contribn. of £150,000 to be secured by precept.

Ll.G. “Right” of self-determination mght, if conceded here, be used by Irish Rep. Govt. as ground for demandg. plebiscite there. Mght even be awkward qua Scottish &amp; Welsh nationalists.

A.L.B. Cd. argue, re Ireland, tht. we have partitioned – and that minorities cd. now move across borders at will.

Willing, however, to re-consider wording – may not be necessary to use both words “principle” and “right”.

P.T. Can we really run both liberal constitn. and partition – in one para.

A.L.B. The 2 concepts are consecutive, not concurrent. S.d., and partition, don’t arise while liberal constitn. is functioning.

L.P. C.O.S. consider that partition is inconsistent with m’tenance of Base.

P.T. Wd. wish to see memo. by C.O.S. before I assented to that view.

216

A.L.B. Doesn’t arise so long as we m’tain our sovereignty.

W.M. Dissent fr. P.T.’s view. Wdn’t work – qua security of base. I object to partition on human grounds. But I am persuaded we can’t exclude it altogether. Also that mention of it is necessary to secure G. &amp; T. acquiescence in this present plan.

P.T. Dangerous to reply on assumptn. tht. T. will in the end prevent our losing out altogether on s-d.

K. No inconsistency. All we say is tht., when constn. is working &amp; our strategic need of base is exhausted, we don’t then exclude partition altogether.

Ll.G.’s point can be met by drafting change.

P.T.’s anxieties can be allayed by running this para. into preceding.

L.P. Is it really necessary to mention plebiscite? Repercussions on Ireland etc.,

R.A.B. C.P. Cttee. cd. look at statement in light of to-day’s discussion : resume discn. on Thurs.

M’while, S.Ll. cd. show R. Rept. to Repves. of G. &amp; T. at N.A.T.O. Mtg.

A.L.B. Wd. wish to warn Govt. supporters before I go to 2 Capitals.

L.P.S. Party isn’t in good mood to take this before Xmas. They wd. fear this as indication of Br. departure from Cyprus.

AL.B. But danger of delay is tht. Socialists will harden in their attitude.

Need for some reference to s.d. &amp; partition arises fr. fact tht. T. wd., without it, come out in rigid opposn. to the constitution.

A.N. We agree. Believe both G &amp; T. wd. like to accept constitution if they are enabled to.

Agree : L.P. to re-draft statement.

Cab. to consider again on Thursday.

A.L.B.’s visit to G &amp; T. to be p’poned until after then.

Final decision by Cab. on Tuesday.

D.S. Party will find it v. diff. to stomach this before Xmas.

K. Satisfied tht. G &amp; T. will reject the R. Rpt. unless the 2 disputed paras. are included in statement.

H. Agree. But is it impossible to defer Rpt. &amp; statement until end/Jany.?

P.T. Cd. you say tht. we are discussing with G. &amp; T.

217

A.L.B. If we did, they wd. leak it.

I.M. Balance of advantage : in favour of A.L.B. procdg. with his plan. Tho’ he must safeguard posn. of P.M.

We may be losing last chance of a solution.

R.A.B. Merits : go ahead as planned. But risk : another M/E. row in H/C.

2. Singapore.

A.L.B. On arrival in Ldn. Lim Y. Hok has repeated suggn. of internal security being controlled by Cttee. on wh. Malayan repves. wd. have in effect a casting vote. Cdn’t reject this out of hand.

L.P. Last Conference failed on i) internal security ii) “Govr/Genl” to be repve. of U.K. Govt., not of Queen.

Situation has changed because Lim Y.H. controls sitn. as Marshall didn’t.

Diffy, however – our repve. wd. be little more than Amb. : can he therefore be given right to suspend constitn. Hence new plan : domestic jurisdn. with local Govt : def. &amp; extern. affairs for U.K. Govt : but 2 sides wd. be on equality.

Believe that this is on right lines.

L.P.S. If. constitn. is suspended, how cd. U.K. Govt. repve. act unless he controlled Br. troops. etc.,

A.L.B. Malayanisation of police will soon mean tht. he has to rely wholly on Br. troops, in any event, even if this is done.

D.S. Cd. we not retain U.K. sovereignty over area of Base.

A.L.B. Then the rest wd. be as Spain is to Gib. Worst course of all.

D.S. Don’t get committed to eventual union of Singapore with Malaya.

L.P.S. More study needed of relations betwn. Govr. Genl &amp; U.K. repve. Cd. Official Cttee. be re-convened on this ques.

Agreed : A.L-B. to hold exploratory talks with Lim Y. Hok

without commitment.

[Exit A.N., Gosford.

[Enter G Ward, H.W.

3. Suez Canal.

R. S.Ll. is discussing with F.D. in Paris. 457. Paris.

Dixon .. .. .. H. in N. York. 1631. N. Yk.

Wheeler is looking at Canal &amp; will then talk to Egyptians.

218

Awkward in these circs. to begin to move our ships away from Port Said on 12/12. Indeed, seems warranted to leave them there even after our belligerent troops have left.

G.W. Wheeler may take a difft. view after he has seen our repve. in Pt. Said this evening.

If we are working at Pt. Said &amp; ready to move 6 ships down Canal, there will be nothg. to move away to Cyprus.

In fact, however, the urgent work in Pt. Said is finished.

L.P. Must not agree to leave our ships w’out crews.

H.W. Agree.

H.W. Must not w’draw our salvage vessels on 12/12.

Will add at least a month to time of clearance if we don’t work on it.

G.W. Yes : one to two months.

F.O. to inform S.Ll. of views expressed. [Exit A.L.B.

4. Economic Situation.

H.B. Approval of I.M.F. drawings.

Atmosphere v. friendly. Warm U.S. support. Welcome for decision not to impose import controls.

Vote : Egyptian abstained.

[Exit H.W.

5. Export of Arms : Sale of Carrier to Argentine.

G.W. No strategic objn. Threat is there anyway.

Economic advantage.

Political – régime is more friendly: helpful if 2 Navies draw together.

R. Agree. Navy is dominant in Argentine politics to-day.

H. x/ Wd. like to give advance infn. to A &amp; N.Z.

Shd. we not try to bargain this for a deal on Antarctic.

G.W. No – for they can buy carrier fr. U.S.

H.B. No financial objn.

G.W. S.Ll. may like to consider informing U.S. Govt. They won’t like it.

R. y/ Will consider.

Approved – subject to x/ and y/. [Exit G.W.

219

6. Broadcasting : 14 Day Rule.

L.P.S. Impasse because Labour Party have divided views.

PMG. Try for assurance from all b’casting authies. tht., if Govt. suspend rule, they will themselves use discretion to avoid anticipation – for trial of 6 months.

L.P.S. Ready to try this on Leader of Opposition.

B.H. But will you ever be able then to re-instate it?

E.H. How much confidence can we put in assurance of p’mme cos.

L.P.S. If Labour won’t wear this, revert to a 7 day rule.
