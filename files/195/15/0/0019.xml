C.M. 55(56). 31st July, 1956.

1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.

R.A.B. Debates : Wed. – on Adjournment. Suez Canal : 2 hrs. 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.

Business for week after resumption : 23rd. Oct.

In Statement, refce. to existg. power to recall Parlt. if necessary in public interest. *Prorogue 29/10. New Session 6/11.

L.P. Debate in H/L. on Suez must be on day followg. H/C. If pressed for it, will offer it for Thurs.

On * you mght need another week if procedure proposed for H/L. reform were finally approved.

P.M. Need you announce date of new session now, as situation is fluid?

2. House of Lords Reform.

L.P. Cab. criticism of “self-selection” of h. Peers. Alternatives : selection by Cttee. of Pr. Council. Less good because less knowledge of capacities of Peers. Statutory powers to H/L. to limit membership (Swinton Cttee.) e.g. exclusion on criterion of non-attendance: but that wd. not be best criterion, and wd. also leave decision to the House. Two writs : officials are examining but I am v. doubtful about it. My concln. therefore is tht. my plan is better than any other advanced. Real alternative is to reverse Wensleydale decn. &amp; leave h. Peers untouched. But I can’t recommend that, for I am on record many times as holding the view tht. h. element shd. be reformed. I cd. not therefore propose reform limited to life Peers. Cab. must either drop idea of reform or find someone else to propose the shorter version.

I have to see my supporters in H/L. this p.m. Cd. I put my plan on

x| basis that Cab. are not yet committed to it.

P.M. Can’t take final decision to-day. Can we go as far as x/. I think we cd. And then we can review our posn. during Recess.

R.A.B. I support L.P.’s view. Wd. support “longer version”.

P.M. Ministers with strong views may send them in.

E.H. Procedure. Resolutions tabled in spill-over. Debate in H/L. on them while H/C. is on Debate on Address. Mention in Q. Speech wd. be adjusted accordingly.

L.P. That wd. be acceptable to me.

[Enter Att.G.

3. Capital Punishment.

E.H. Am not yet in posn. to estimate wtr we cd. get a majority.

P.M. 1922 Exec. were uncertain.

Not enough support for me to announce intentn. before recess.

L.P. Will lose much support if we don’t regain initiative.

R.A.B. Believe we cd. carry this, with Whip. But I cdn’t put Whips on against Silverman. If that were then carried, the first wd. be waste of time. Believe there is still majority in H/C. for complete abolition.

P.M. This wd. mean 2 Bills : gt. bitterness because flouting will of House.

E.H. Silverman cd. devise amendmt. to our Bill wh. wd. have same effect as his Bill. Cdn’t. then vote that down, with Whips.

L.P. H/L. would throw out that clause.

P.M. Opponents of abolition press me to say that in that event all members of Govt. wd. vote against Silverman amendment. Cd. I do that?

P.T. When a Govt. Bill is promoted, posn. is different. Easier to be firm with supporters.

P.M. Reluctant to create gt. bitterness in H/C. in a diff. internl. situation.

Ll.G. Last Gallop Poll : 29% in favour of retentn. for some murders : 40% in favour abolition : 30% in favour of retention.

H.M. Govt. cannot have an open ques. Weakens Govt. All precedents show it. In last resort we must decide either to put in our Bill or to accept abolition.

But we can’t settle it before recess.

Agree : no statement before Recess.

[Enter R.T.

4. Hospitals : Capital Expenditure.

R.T. Disagreemt. on m’tenance expenditure. Ty. wants to come down from £12 to £10. This means telling Bds. we are going lower than we promised in Feb. ’55. Appalled at condns. – esp. in m. hospitals.

I.M. It was long delayed. V. serious trouble if we go back on it now.

H.M. £580 M. on N.H.S. In £100 M. p’mme no contn. at all from M/H. This illustrates diffies. of natl. economy. No method of reducg.

91

expend’re wh. doesn’t hurt. We are spending more than we produce &amp; thus creatg. inflation.

P.M. Can there be no off-setting economies elsewhere in N.H.S.

R.T. Have tried: but can’t do it.

L.P. Proper solution is for people to make larger contn.

P.M. Approve this memo: £11 M. But consider off-setting economies. And in autumn drastic review of civil expend’re.

[Exit R.T.

[Enter A.J.

5. Open-cast Mining.

J.S. My E. Lothian sites must be reserved pro-tem.

H.A. Link improved compensn. with continuance of p’mme – in any statement.

H.M. D.R. – consider with genl. problem of land legislation.

D.S. No approach to l.a.’s until my Dpt. and M/F &amp; P. have looked again at 7 sites in Yorkshire.

A.J. V. well.

Memo. approved. [Exit A.J.

6. Rent Restriction. [Re-enter S.Ll.

L.P. H’to strongly in favour of doing this before Election.

But now. Little credit fr. supporters. We shall have odium of raising rents. Labour, if they win, will be able to take over with little further increase of rents.

Part of Labour plan that special valuation will be made for take-over.

Is this still wise?

L.P.S. No doubt of economic need to act.

But will it give enough money to enable repairs to be done? will our supporters stand it? Affects 4 m. houses. Party organn. are v. doubtful.

J.S. Sc. housing being re-valued betwn. now &amp; 1960.

D.S. Party : my impn. is tht. they want this done &amp; quickly. Housing Cttee. of H/C. met w’out me, at my request, and with one exception all were in favour.

Resolutions fr. constituencies urging action.

92

We shd. follow policies consistent with our views. Action is needed.Take it relatively early in session.

H.A. Diff. to justify running away from this 3 years before Election.

H.M. Injustice to tenants. i) Gross disparity betwn. rents of new &amp; rent-controlled houses ii) shortage of houses to let : because all controlled houses coming free are sold, not rented.

P.M. D.S. shd. spk. to Chairman of Party.

L.P. Don’t press my point.

D.E. Favour doing this. But hope we shall then avoid increase in rates.

Agreed : Re-affirm decision

D.S. to spk. to Chairman of Party

L.P.S. to watch the point re rates.

[Exit E.H.

7. Films.

H.M. As in memo. To avoid purchase of U.S. films.

Ques : a voluntary or a statutory levy. Believe latter is necessary.

R.A.B. Legn. wd. be needed – and will involve some controversy.

I.M. V. diff. Bill for Tories : &amp; likely to crowd out more desirable legn. But won’t press arguments used in E.P.C.

P.T. “It is impossible to apply principle to the film industry”.

R.A.B. There is a case for this Bill. Don’t oppose its inclusion in p’mme.

Agree in principle. RAB to consider how to fit it in to Leg.

P’mme.

Authorise P.T. to announce intentn to introduce methods

necessary to finance film production, incldg. a reference

to stat. means of continuing existg. Fund.
