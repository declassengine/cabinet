C.M. 58(56). 3rd August, 1956.

[Enter A.S., H.W., A.H., E.H.

1. Suez Canal.

S.Ll. Conference: composn. in return for U.S. co-opn.

London. Not more than one week.

M’while large dipl. exercise. Divided countries to be approached.

First step: C.R.O. to approach Doms.

F.O. Norw., Sw., Denmark, Portuguese.

French : Italy &amp; Ethiopia.

U.S. : Japan, Saudi (?) &amp; others.

At Confce. : pass short resoln. in favour of internatl. control. Put this to friendly countries in advance. Will be ready on Monday. Avoid discn. of detailed scheme at this stage.

Risk : Egypt may accept principle &amp; delay discn. on detail. But that wd be humiliating in itself. And, if long delay apparent, we mght be able to insist on restoratn. of status quo m’while.

May be able to work out with French an outline scheme wh. cd be put to E. at same time as we present ultimatum, with resolution.

H.M. Or put into resoln. as much of the scheme as it will bear.

S.Ll. Have tried this. Wd. like to discuss both documents with colleagues to-day. U.S. &amp; Fr. have assented to draft resolution.

Re-actions in other countries are not too bad.

P.M. Outline of mil. plan approved. Will be costly.

H.M. Signs of nerves – on exchanges – purchase of Canadian securities etc., May have to use some reserves to prevent rate fr. falling too far.

2. Procedure.

P.M. Ministers not concerned with Egypt Cttee. shd. take leave in Aug.

K : can go to Denmark, even tho’ Att. Genl. in America, if Solr. Genl. is available to advise as needed.

A.L.B. : can go to Med.

P.M. will see Radcliffe.

P.T : has cancelled trip to Italy. Will be w’in call.

P.M. A.J : May be wanted here. Fuel rationing.

S.Ll. Better to go, but not stay as long as planned.

A.J. shd. overlap with Nasser.

S.Ll. Will get Hayter’s view on this.

P.M. Shdn’t meet Nasser.

95

P.M. No mtgs of standing Cab. Cttees. save Egypt Cttee.

Suez ques will be settled by E. Cttee. Unless this, or other emergency business requires mtg of Cab. – to be attended by such Ministers as are available.

R.A.B. Let this be mentioned, if you see Editors.

[Exit A.J., H.W.

3. Building Controls.

H.M. Avoid taking definite line on this in public.

Will submit my considered views in autumn.

Believe there may have to be some dirigisme in modern times –imports, investment etc.,

Suez crisis may make it even more necessary.

B.H. My memo. indicates gt. practical diffies. of operatg. bldg. control.

Effect of credit squeeze. Architects – first to feel its effects – have now said tht. it will result in marked falling-off in bldg. work in next few months. This trade is slow to move: but it seems to be moving now. Employers’ side are beginning to show their teeth.

H.M. I am operating various “controls” like Bank Rate, which can’t be m’tained indefinitely.

P.T. V. big distinction betwn. control wh. stops a man borrowg. more money &amp; one wh. stops him using his own.

It wdn’t save you fr. dear money &amp; financial controls.

B.H. It wd. have to be a v. low limit – £3.000 – to be effective. Even then it can be evaded by bldg. in instalments.

D.S. Gt. diffies.

J.S. i) l.A. bldg. in Sc. will be down by 25% fr. peak year.

ii) M’tenance is large element : can’t be controlled : is useful.

I.M. Signs on labour side that unemplt. is beginning to increase.

R.A.B. Wd. like to review this in connn. with commercial policy. Import control acts much more quickly.

Agreed : no public commitment meanwhile.

4. Agricultural Wages.

Award of 6/= – universal regret.

96

R.A.B. Combined with bad harvest.
