C.M. 40 (56) 7th June, 1956

1. Soviet Union : P.M.’s Visit

[Enter. R., E.H.

P.M. Consultn. with Hayter shows that Apl./May wd. be appropriate. He advises early announcement. I will concert this with Moscow.

2. Parliament.

R.A.B. Business for next week.

3. Parliament : Remuneration of Members.

R.A.B. Labour Party have now decided to press for enquiry.

Can’t do this now – not this session.

They threaten all-Party motion. If it comes to debate, we must have Whips on.

J.S. Enquiry undignified – matter for Parlt. to decide.

H.M. x/ Enquiry likely to result in recommn for too high a salary : prs £5.000

D.E. Wd. prefer to make a modest increase quickly.

I.M. Great mistake to do it now. Mght agree in principle that it is right, but say this is not the moment. Against enquiry : agree with x/.

R.A.B. If we conceded enquiry, might get report too soon e.g. July or Sept.

H.M. Cd. we decide provisionally to do 3 point project next session + Cr. Court Judges. But announce only that this must be left over until next year.

P.T. Enquiry wd. buy time. We cd. gain credit by giving less than report recommends.

E.H. Majority of our supporters in H/C. wd. oppose enquiry – or dislike it.

S. If there is enquiry, I wd. welcome its extension to H/Lds.

H.M. If it comes to debate : we cd. say we recognise need, but this is not moment for Parlt. to increase our remuneration : indicate hope that it may be poss. to deal with this next year.

17

4. Economic Situation.

P.M. Can’t see both employers &amp; natd. indies. before M/L. goes to Geneva on 15/6.

I.M. Private employers is the more important. Do that first.

H.M. I agree. “Last of series”, not a new ganging-up v. workers. See that this is put across in Press.

P.T. Cd. we make it clear to farmers tht. they won’t get full recoupment for wage increase.

H.A. They never have had it, save in special review.

H.M. Can’t we make it clear to them that they won’t get a special review for this occasion.

P.T. Put that in to tribunal as Govt. view?

H.A. Gap – cpd. other workers – is still large. Likely to get 7/= increase.

Agreed: H.M. to consider with H.A. &amp; I.M. what, if

anything, can be done.

5. Disarmament. [Enter A.N.

W.M. Concerned at gap before new weapons become available. Below 25 megaton &amp; 100 Kiloton by 1960.

Think Cab. shd. have the above in mind – tho’ I don’t oppose F.O. proposal. We shall need atomoic war-heads also, for g. missiles.

S. If we accept this, we must recognise that if we reach para 11 stage before 1970 or so we cdn’t agree to go forward. To that extent we may not be quite ingenuous about this.

P.M. I wdn’t accept what C.O.S. regard as “minimum” stockpile. Before 1970 we shd. prob. have quite enough.

D.S. Para. 8. Crux will be to get Powers to agree that effective control organn. is in existence. Clear to me that B. &amp; K. won’t accept it.

P.M. May be. But worth pursing. Somethg. else may come out of it. We shd. go on.

A.N. Next step : consultn. with U.S., Canada &amp; France.

U.S. much concerned about 4th. country. They may insist on earlier stop on supply of material. If so, we shd. need their guarantee tht. they wd. provide our needs of material.

18

Wd. show it to R. before we tabled it in N.York.

[Enter N.B.

6. Jordan : Air Force.

A.N. Holding opn. to prevent Hussein fr. getting Migs. He is under pressure to get R. aircraft. Want to keep him in play, w’out commitment.

H.M. Course 3 is best. Gives us more time to consider whole situation. Play for time on those lines.

[Exit N.B.

7. Anglo-Egyptian Treaty : Celebrations.

A.N. Terminal date of Treaty is to be celebrated in Cairo on 19/6. This is to be Egypt’s National Day, indefinitely. Diff. for us to boycott it. Propose tht. Amb. shd. attend, but to warn them we shan’t care for it if they use it as anti-British occasion.

Wd’nt look good if we sulked.

Repve. of Arab Legion has decided not to go.} But that is different fr.

Iraq have decided not to send delegation. } attendance by repves. in

Cairo.

[Enter R.T.

8. Nuclear Radiation.

S. Our genetics, report is re-assuring. But other ques. canvassed –

i) strontium : effects on bones. Liable to cause public alarm. But not at present a serious risk.

ii) appreciable risk from diagnostic radiology. This will need further examination.

Much will turn on presentation. Careful thought has bn. given to this. Publish 12/6: P.Q. indicatg. that it is in Vote Office. Draft submitted. No reference to strontium. Who shd. make statement? P.M. or L.P.S. P.M. to decide. Lobby Conference, with scientists on parade. Also conference with scientific correspondents. Our report will be publicly available at 6. p.m. U.S. report at 7. p.m.

U.S. Report. We have seen it. Follows ours v. closely – tho’ no collusion. Strontium: they think 1.000 units for industrial risk &amp; 100 for general. They think they shd. consider seriously at 50: we said at 10. Disposal of radio-active waste. Cttee. of oceanographers have considered dropping it at sea: they advise an internatl. conference because effect on fish etc., They are even more concerned about medical use – wh. in U.S. is doubling the dose : &amp; they suggest enquiry on that.

Doubtless, a debate will be demanded.

R.T. Occupational risks to workers in A.E. establishments. Will cause anxiety.

19

S. They intend to stagger exposure to main risk. Will see that we are ready with an answer on this point.

R.T. Hope P.M. won’t repeat title of report – that is alarming.

9. Nuclear Weapons: 1957 Tests.

P.M. U.S. have bn. makg. diffies. over this – suggestg. it is Election issue in U.S. – tho’ actually there has bn. no difference between us on limitation. On this a/c I have amended final para. New draft circulated.

Can say, in reply to suppl. “This was in Anglo-Fr. disarmament plan which we tabled…. Dis. Commn. will be mtg. again w’in next few weeks, and that is the place where it shd. be examined.”

Approved.

10. Prince Ernst of Hanover. [Enter AttG.

[Exit Att.G.

[Not heard.]

11. Education : Capital Investment.

D.E. Not heard].

H.M. Issue is wtr we carry on at average of £5 or £4 M p. month. Higher figure wd. be more than last year. Shd. we spread the £90 M over 4 years or less? Propose as compromise : £30M/£25M to start with. But don’t be commd. to £30/30M thereafter. Say it will be at least £20/20M and [if conditions improve may be raised to £30 M.] After discussion – proposed “run on at £25 M and [].”

Approved.
