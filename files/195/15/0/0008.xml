C.M. 44(56). 19th June, 1956.

1. Ministerial Speeches. [Enter E.H.

P.M. Performance is uneven : some Ministers aren’t doing enough.

Hope colleagues will try to do more – keep in touch with Central Office.

2. Electricity Prices.

P.M. Citrine did this w’out any prior consultn., tho’ consulted Dpt. on terms of announcement.

What line do we take in H/C. P.Q.’s to M/F &amp; P. Will help middle classes. Done out of reserves.

H.M. Say : this is decision of Authority, but we welcome it.“Considering what to do about natd. indies. : we might nationalise them : as independent empires they give us worst of both worlds.”

3. Soviet Union: Trade.

S.Ll. Malik called Saty. : suggd. experts visit to discuss trade &amp; [see something of our industry]. Timing : end of next week.

P.T. Response to our suggn. at end of B &amp; K. visit. They have gone rather further on [ ]. But shd. welcome it.

P.M. If it’s business-like, sooner the better. If it’s jamboree, wd. take longer to arrange.

4. Libya.

S.Ll. P.M., Libya, is blackmailing us for more money : suggests renewal or contince. of Treaty depends on this. He has had offers fr. R. and Egypt. Must consider how much Libya is worth to us. We prob. can’t do all he wants without U.S. help.

P.M. U.S. re-action? Wheeler Field.

S.Ll. May have to have mtg. of Ministers.

5. Cyprus.

S.Ll. Have put to Turkey plan for constitn. : reference of strategic issue to NATO after 10 years : then plebiscite on s-determinn. after concln. of defence treaty (U.K., T. &amp; G.). Initial re-action

35

unfavourable. Propose now to add that defence zones bases wd. be under permanent Br. control with facilities for use by NATO Allies.

P.M. Mght. also consider allowing T. a zone of their own. Assumption is tht., after plebiscite, Gks. wd. have rest of island : without right to military bases there.

H.A. Turks wdn’t want it?

P.M. No : purely prestige point for them.

P.M. Have also put scheme to U.S. Govt. Await their comment.

A.L.B. Govr. wants men under long-term sentences to be transfd. to U.K. Partly on security grounds : partly because gives impn. sentences won’t be remitted. Unusual – indeed no precedentfor Colony.

Ll.G. Wd. be contrary to spirit of Act, wh. contemplated health or benefit of prisoner. Will be criticised as exile : many are under 21 yrs. Ready to agree, if Cab. want it.

P.M. Prefer he shd. hold them in Cyprus.

A.L.B. V. well: I will so inform Govr.

S. Gk. interference with Br. airliner. If facts warrant it, I hope strong protest will be made.

S.Ll. Will consider.

6. Egypt : Treaty Celebrations.

S.Ll. Robertson went with F.O. approval. Some feeling has bn. caused in Party.

E.H. Moderate displeasure. Motion tabled.

P.M. Not of gt. importce. If they behave ill, he will walk out.

7. Stamp Issues. [Enter P.M.G.

Ch.H. As in memo.

Ll.G. Won’t encourage nationalism in Wales.

H. J.S. takes this view, but I don’t agree. Nationalism is quiescent : this wd. stir it up.

36

B.H. That is my feeling.

D.S. Precedent already in coinage. Scottish shilling etc.,

S. Our anxieties re nationalism have bn. allayed by responsible Ministers.

Sel. Agree with J.S. – will draw teeth of lunatic fringe.

H.M. Once for all £½ M. But Mint fear repercussions on coinage – don’t want to develop separate designs.

Can’t therefore be determined on financial grounds.

R.A.B. Don’t discourage a G.P.O. initiative.

H.M. N. Ireland re-action?

Ch.H. Brookeboro’s initial re-action was favourable.

K. Harmless methods of pleasing local opinion help to spike guns of extreme nationalists.

P.T. Support that view.

H.A. So do I.

Memo. approved. [Exit P.M.G.

8. France.

S.Ll. P.M. &amp; I are invited to Paris for discns. 13/7 to 15/7.

P.M. Nothing to discuss. Merely designed to please French.

S.Ll. Jebb thinks it wd. steady opinion in France.

Agreed: Accept in principle; but dally on dates because

PMM and Iraq state visit.

9. Future of N.A.T.O.

Military.

P.M. New military policy for N.A.T.O. Message read. Canada (Pearson) – initial response favourable. Dulles has replied tht. U.S. are thinkg. on similar lines but ques of method &amp; timing needs considn. Must also ensure tht. Adenauer’s posn. is not undermined. Fr. that angle, fuller disclosure of our views may be

37

less harmful than rumours. Shd. consult him on these ideas &amp; see how he thinks they may affect his political position.

H.M. Can you discuss with G. w’out France?

S.Ll. Standing Group countries + Germany. Ques for discn. with Aden. wd. be solely presentn., not merits.

Don’t want argument conducted on basis of our economic weakness.

P.M. Initial re-actions are not bad. Pentagon will be trouble.

S.Ll. Aim : mtg. of NATO Ministers in July – followg. 4 Power prelimy.

P.M. Monty y’day volunteered agreemt. with our ideas – U.K. contn. wd be only 2 Divns.

S.Ll. R. note is added complicn. Approach to 7 countries. Prob. best to send sympathetic interim reply. Then seek agreement on a western view.

Final decision turns on rate of Eisenhower’s recovery.

Political and Economic.

D.E. Cd. more be done on cultural. Pull together diverse activities.

S.Ll. Will consider that suggn.

R.A.B. Avoid overlap with O.E.E.C.

S.Ll. Yes.

P.M. Go slow with Parliamentary side.

Memo. approved.

H.A. H/C. and Congress are further apart than for many years. Strong contrast to posn. during war.

10. Government Expenditure : Economies. [Enter J.S.

State of Play at 6.30 p.m. y’day.

H.M. Defence £30. (4 runs disallowed.)

H. Defence £13¼. (3¼ runs .. . But can add footnote tht. purchases for stock will be reduced by £10 M. but for technical reasons can show only £¾ M. cost of handling.)

Social Services £3¼. (milk 10d. + delay in capital developmt.)

D.E. Justificn. for cutting capital work was assumptn. tht. nos. wd. fall because of increase in price. But accept decision. 38

H.M. Cd. be related to “minor works incldg. kitchens etc.,”

D.E. May be loan expenditure &amp; not w’in Estimate.

H.M. Propose to include £½ M. on Overseas Infn.

S.Ll. Don’t think you will get that much (because of overheads) on cutting out f. language b’casts.

H.M. If I omit this, it is £69¼ M – showing Jordan loan.

Discuss with F.O. wtr Jordan loan is shown &amp; wtr £¼ M can be shown for Informn. Services.

This will give me something like £68(?).

Further efforts now made by M/Defence will bring it to the order of £75 M.

We have lost Comet offer, and I wd. sooner not have the “rounding off.” x

P.M. Involves risk in running down Admy. oil stocks. Cab. shd. know.

H.M. Intolerable that e.g. M/H. shd. offer no savings at all. Must have a go at them on 2nd. round.

Where change is over £1 M., new Estimates will be presented.

x Want to e able to say tht. these are honest changes in p’mmes wh.

don’t take a/c. of shortfalls. But w’out gt. changes of policy : the savings from those are yet to come.

P.M. On bombers, I still want to see a redn. in orders e.g. on Vulcan if Victor prove satisfactory.

R.A.B. Insufficient fr. angle of relief of resources. Won’t impress foreigners sufficiently.

We shd. reduce Vulcan prodn. And it cd. be done at once by executive decision if we had will to make it.

D.S. Why have a ‘reserve’ for bomber force – if it’s a 3 day war.

W.M. For replacement at peace-time rates.

Don’t want to take R.A.B. decn. w’out considg. effect on N.A.T.O. Cdn’t in fact be taken “as executive decision to-day” w’out risk of serious U.S. re-action. May lose whole of Plan K. support – $70m. We got it on promise of front-line strength of 240.

H.M. Those risks wd. be less if we reduced rate of prodn. (Vulcan &amp; Victor) by 1 p. month in each case.

P.M. Wd. prefer to leave Victor untouched – better aircraft.

39

H.M. Meet that point by placing no more orders for Vulcan after present batch.

S. Not yet sure tht. Victor will prove as good as promised.

H.M. At least delay placg. further order for Vulcans.

S.Ll. Slowing down wd. do more harm than good qua relief to metal-using industries.

P.M. Will work for further decn. on bombers in July.

[Enter R.Carr.

11. Agricultural Wages.

H.M. Discussed with M/L. and Ag. Ministers. Unions have a claim. Tradition is tht. Govt. shd. put their views to the Board.

Important also tht. Turner shd. not be confident tht. large recoupment wd. follow thro’ a special review.

H.A. Opposed to incldg. this sort of thing in evce. to Bd. viz., draft circulated to Cab.

5 neutral members on Board. Unions have complained tht. Bd. is takg. too much a/c of general economic situation.

Objns. to this proposed evce. to Bd.

Cd. write to N.F.U.’s ; but it wd. also be unwise to present them with firm decision.

R.C. Increase wd. increase pressure on other wages later in year.

Think we shd. do all we can – but short of direct intervention. Final sentence of H.M.’s draft goes too far, on that a/c.

P.M. Ques of tactics.

Like suggn. of linking Special Review change with long-term changes in price-fixing procedure.

H.A. Can ensure tht. substance of lr. to Turner (my revised draft) reaches Bd. and Unions. Don’t want direct approach to Bd.

Agreed: Approach N.F.U.’s in terms of H.A.’s revised

draft.

H.M. Then what response do we make to Bd.’s request for statistics &amp; apprecn. of genl. economic situation.

H.A. Factual stuff only: but include extracts fr. Ministers’ speeches – which will show clearly what our policy is.

P.T. If any commn. is to be made, wd. welcome a more direct expn. on lines of H.M.’s draft.

40

Agreed : Communication to Bd. on lines of previous

communications – avoid exposing Govt. to charge

of interfering with an arbitration.

12. Hong Kong.

A.L.B. Want to deport to Formosa prs. held on suspicion of complicity in Indian aircraft explosn.

Agreed.
