C.M. 72(56). 23rd October, 1956.

[Enter E.H.

1. Queen’s Speeches : Prorogation.

Approved – subject to one amendment.

2. House of Lords Reform.

K. (i) Discussed with Peers in Govt. &amp; some others. a) Mandatory provn. in Bill tht. Sel. Cttee. shd. be in propn. votes at last Election + 5 cross-benchers. (1/6th of total); or b) Ld. Ch. Cttees., Leaders 3 Parties, 1/6th. cross-benchers, &amp; remainder selected by H/L. “havg. regard to” propn. votes at last Election.

All consulted ready to accept b) – &amp; thght it wd. be acceptable to H/L.

They thght a) mght not be acceptable to the House.

Proposal on lines of b) wd. therefore be acceptable to me.

(ii) Swamping. With fixed composn. of H/L., Tory Govt. cd. increase its powers &amp; Labour successor wd. have no power to alter for many years.

Theoretical objn : it cd. be met by provn. in Bill, if thght necessary, tho’ there are objns. to it.

All whom I consulted took v. strong view this is last chance – &amp; necessary to prevent H/L. dying on feet.

H. Feeling in H/L. is hardening in favour of comprehensive scheme.

R.A.B. This (b) is improvemt. qua H/C. – more easy to defend.

Congestion of Legve. P’mme: can only be relieved by dropping one major Bill. But, if this can’t be p’poned for 12 mos., must try it.

Controversy in H/C. won’t hurt this coming session.

Some action re H/L. is urgent. More diff. to pay before reform.

Swamping :

D.S. Parlt. Act procedure cd. apply to measure reforming H/L.

A.L.B. Content with b). Support.

P.T. What prospects has such legn. in H/C. What will Tories in H/C. think. Believe they mayn’t like it – prefer to leave it alone.

I.M. Think H/C. wd. prefer to leave it alone – because they think it works well enough.

Bad in principle to decide compn. of H/L. on basis of votes at Election.

This weakening of her. principle in H/L. will make it easier to

x| weaken Monarchy.

y| Will force Labour to harden in favour of opposn. to continuance of H/L.

157

A.H. Some supporters in H/C. won’t like this.

W.M. Sympathise with I.M., save on x/.

b) helps to meet by position. [Enter S.Ll.

Ll.G. Support longer version : but wd. wish to know what support we shall get in H/C.

Watch y/.

D.S. Endorse y/. E-…..

H.A. Explore attitude of our supporters.

D.E. Public don’t realise H/L. is collapsing. Any strengthening of it will encounter oppn. of H/C.

B.H. Favour longer Bill – essential to deal with backwoodsmen. May not be another chance. Want it this Session.

Ch.Wh. No discn. in Party. No keenness for reform : no pressure. Since Confce. chaps are beginning to talk about it – both views are being expressed. No knowledge yet on wh. they cd. form an opinion.

J.S. Support L.P. and K. Not unpopular thing to improve 2nd. Chamber. If it stirs Labour to advocate abolition, that won’t do them any good.

H. H/L. is dying. Oppn. had died already.

Payment alone wdn’t revive it.

L.P. This is moment for decn. This is last chance in this Parlt. – for must allow Electorate to see how reformed House is working before Genl. Election.

This is not first plan of reform.

On b) wd. prefer a vaguer formula not directly related to voting at Eln.

Swamping: believe it’s academic. Contested Bill takes 9 mos. to pass : and total delay is only 12. 3 mos. is minimum needed to enable public to understand a diff. issue. But, if necessary, you cd. have a power to swamp – tho’, if you used it, how wd. you revert to original no. of H/L? I wd. prefer therefore to argue tht. it is unnecessary.

Argument at x/ means there never can be reform. Can’t avoid fierce controversy over hereditary principle.

“No demand for reform.” Must, clearly, ascertain views of supporters in H/C. But many have expd. support to me: Party Confces. have passed resoln. in favour : Govt. are pledged to do it.

Left don’t want reform : Right fear to do it. As result, authy. of H/L. has diminished : we are now near to one-chamber Govt. If you want to reduce risk of abolition, better to reform it.

158

“Better do nothing.” A tenable view, tho’ I don’t hold it. Believe, however, tht. by deciding to do nothing now we shall be condemning H/L. to lingering decay.

I have now led Party in H/L. for 15 years. Have throughout pressed for reform – pay, repn. of Govt., composn. I have had no satisfn, at all. No career now for young Peers: no prospect of office.

Next year wd. be too late.

Appeal to Cab. to act – before it is too late.

Selk. Agree on urgency.

Life Peers = the more important. Other part of plan is H/L. cleaning up its own affairs.

Her. principle gives independence to balance undue dependence on popular vote.

P.M. There are rivalries betwn the Houses. H/C. never keen to give more power to H/L.

I wd. be ready to support this plan, if colleagues favour it.

L.P. “if time permits” qualificn. in Q. Speech – as mere device for taking

z| soundings in H/C.

R.A.B. Has bn. in all Election manifestoes – &amp; often in Q. Speeches since ’51.

L.P. I cd. not advocate short Bill or no Bill.

H.A. V. strong case for this. Worst attitude of Party will be lack of enthusiasm.

H.M. Wd. support z. Can’t apply my mind to this great ques in such a crisis as we are in. V. gt. issues about, on wh. we must stand together.

B.H. “If time permits” is v. feeble for a large measure. Better to say “Proposals will be laid…..” Wd. allow for possibility of resolutions.

J.S. Debate in H/L. on resolution.

L.P. Wd. reserve a day in Debte/Address on para. in Q. Speech. Tho’ it wd. mean disclosing plan.

But, unless sure we are going fwd., wd. prefer not to have early debate.

Agreed : (2) “Proposals will be laid in due course”

or Hope to lay ……

(1) Agreed in principle.

(3) Further opportunity to consider some details.

“…… Intentn. of Govt ….. during course of present session”

And, if asked, say “in New Year”.

159

3. Migration Policy.

H.M. Prefer lower ceiling.

P.M. Does it matter, if we don’t reach it? Wd. look bad to reduce it.

H. Offer to discuss with Ty., if it rises : or to Cab. if it goes beyond £½ M.

I.M. Wd. prefer 15 years to 5 …..

4. Legislative Programme.

A.L.B. Malayan legn. will prob. be necessary. Shd. be in A. – contingently.

P.M. If we got agreement with Malta, we shd. have to clinch it by legn.

R.A.B. Cab. must be aware of congestion.

Aim at putting Malta into followg. Session.

Approved – with misgivings.

5. Queen’s Speeches : Opening of Parliament.

Approved – with amendments.

L.P.S. to circulate revised draft for Thursday’s Cabinet.

6. Suez Canal.

P.M. Now seems tht. I. won’t attack. We can’t hold our mil. prepns. for more than a week or so. Winter opn. wd. not be satisf.

French are much concerned. They have had provn. over supply of arms by E. to Alg. rebels. They may wish to act alone – or even with I. – and ask for facilities in Cyprus. Best course : get Pineau over this p.m. &amp; see how gravely they regard provocation. We mght support them in action over that.

A.H. V. unwise to hold reservists much longer.

Condn. of vehicles loaded in ships has already deteriorated. Can’t delay much longer re-loading.

P.M. Also know now tht. I. wd. intervene if we acted.

S.Ll. Egyptians will offer to discuss – w’in S.C. resolution.

H.M. Shd. we summon them to submit proposals of a specified kind? Keep initiative?

160

S.Ll. We can now secure internatl control of Canal – by negotn. We can’t however secure our 2nd. objective of cutting N. down to size. Nor cd. we complete negotns. before date on wh. we will need to dismount our opern.

P.M. If we have to go to Geneva, we must release reservists.

H.M. If we decide tht. we can’t miss this opportunity (R. &amp; U.S. otherwise engaged) we must consider best method. Most honourable course is to put in ultimatum based on 18-Power resoln.

R.A.B. That wd. be v. diff. decn. Parlt. wd. be dismayed – coming in middle of negotn.

A.H. Cd. you have a better occasion for force, later in negotns.

P.M. V. unlikely.

S.Ll. You cdn’t attack later, on this issue. There will be others.

P.M. But not occasions on which we cd. act – e.g. Libya or fall of Nuri.
