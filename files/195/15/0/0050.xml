C.M. 88(56). 26th November, 1956.

1. Official Transport. [Enter E.H., A.N.

R.A.B. M/W. proposes smaller cars for *Ministers : and for officials greater use of pool. (* all save those who need Police protection.)

Agreed : L.P.S. to settle instructions with H.M. and M/W.

B.H. Cd. we not take this opportunity to cut down ostentatious motoring by Service Chiefs.

To even out over-time, Ministers must be ready to use other drivers in evenings.

2. Suez Canal.

R.A.B. S.Ll. proposes to return Tues. p.m. Propose to welcome this. Agreed.

Wd. help us to p’pone major statement until Thurs.

Tel. 1406 from W’ton.

Statement to-day : Opposn. wd. be content with statement on expulsion of Br. nationals. Propose A.N. shd. make it.

A.N. Read draft statement.

Ll.G. Pressure re Egyptians here. Can’t take general action because not at war.

P.T. But we don’t want to retaliate.

A.L.B. Don’t behave as E. do.

H.M. “We don’t meet barbarism with barbarism.”

R.A.B. Strengthen passages re repns. to U.N. &amp; also breach of Gen. Convns.

R.A.B. Propose we defer any public alteration in our policy until S.Ll. is back. Wed. or Thurs. Agreed.

H.M. Will he be pressed to make further statement in U.N. before he leaves. Cd. he not leave early on Tuesday? Avoid involvement in further U.N. debate or statement.

R.A.B. Basis of new policy : large U.N. force by 5/12 &amp; slower build-up : clearance of Canal : basis of negotn. (6 principles w’out sanctions). B. subjects – no bargain ; but likely that no action will be taken if we get on with w’drawal.

194

L.P. On Br. subjects, we shd. at least press U.N. to enforce E. compliance with Gen. Convns. Get facts establd. &amp; if there is breach submit resoln. – even if Afro-Asians vote it down.

A.H. Difficulty with opinion here will be II. – agreemt. tht. clearance won’t start until our w’drawal is complete. If S.Ll. is to come home, he shd. first say tht. we can’t accept that.

A.L.B. Para. I. Are Canadians out?

H. Sec. Genl. retains discretion to determine composn. of Force.

A.H. Total on this para. mght be 6.000 or 7.000.

H.M. Suggest he asks what are combat brigades &amp; what their composn. what will be location of those not in Pt. Said.

Sal. Have we ever said publicly tht. 4.000 wd. be reasonable force.

A.H. We have said 4.000 – 6.000 is our idea of realistic force.

H.A. Para. II wd. be manageable here if it were phased.

H. If survey started now &amp; clearance began on 5/12, we might then start w’drawal.

R.A.B. Minimum on II is that clearance shd. start as soon as w’drawal starts, i.e. during period of w’drawal.

A.H. Or, we cd. start w’drawal as soon as decided clearance cd. begin.

R.A.B. Proceed in parallel : don’t make one conditional on another.

P.T. Must therefore be package deal, on time-table : neither side will accept “principles”.

H.A. Important tht. S.Ll. shd. ascertain before he leaves wtr this wd. practicable way out.

Sal. a. Clearance to begin as soon as practicable.

b. Anglo Fr. forces to move out when U.N. move in.

Separate propns. But we cd. say we wd. accept b. if E. accept a.?

R.A.B. Para III. Push responsibility on to U.N. cf. Goodhart’s lr. to Times.

A.L.B. cf Pearson in N. Yk. 1384 para. 6.

K. Take care not to confuse our reasons for going in.

195

Sal. We did not go in to secure Canal. Don’t imply now that we did. We went in to stop a war.
