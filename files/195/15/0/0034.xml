C.M. 71(56). 18th October, 1956.

1. Government Expenditure. [Enter R.T., E.H., Str.

W.M. 4(A) can be achieved.

Para. 6. – extra £5 M. Think W.O. &amp; Air Miny.can meet this : Admy. outstanding.

P.M. W’drawals fr. G. for Suez wd. give us some net saving.

H.M. Then I may hope for £9.2 M. more on Defence.

H.M. Jordan etc., – no specific announcement at this stage. Same for C.O. Genl. formula – oversea expenditure.

H.M. Health Services. This is modest, on exp’re of £500 M.

R.T. See no scope for other economies. This is best means of tackling a cut. If to operate fr. Dec., must be announced before end of next week – or fr. Jan, 12/xi. Consequential increase for out-patients wd. yield another £150.000 p.a.

Hope to secure £500,000 on hospital stocks.

R.A.B. Better have an announcement in this Session. Thurs. of next week, with as much as ready.

P.T. Travelling. Must have time to consider. £33.000.

H. May need some margin over this.

D.E. Diffies. for H.M.I.’s. Wd. prefer to sack them.

H.M. Ready to say : 5%.

Agreed : Final decision later : aim at 5%.

R.T. Welfare Milk. On 17/2 H.M. said his general redn. didn’t affect welfare milk. Increase of more than ½d. wd. not be consistent.

H.A. ½d. increase wd. yield £0.7 M.

H.M. Can we agree to ½d. increase on ordinary milk from 1/1/56, and consider what we do with special milk. At least differential shd. not be increased.

H.A. Effect of first ½d. has bn. to reduce consumptn. by 1½% – and in Scotland by 6% – while prodn. runs at 8% higher.

Ideal date for further increase wd. be 1/7/57. M. M. Bd. &amp; farmers will say 1/1 is wrong date.

152

But I have agreed tht. subsidy shd. be discontd.

x| Cd. we increase Jan : reduce in spring : make permanent increase in

| autumn.

H.M. Accept x/ in principle. Ready to consider increase in welfare price in connn. with Budget.

Agreed : work out proposals on x/ for retail milk price :

but defer decn. on welfare milk.

D.E. School meals. Now clear that people expected price to go to 1/=.

H.M. Can’t go back on that now. But remember for next spring.

P.M. Defence. Must be further cuts on R. &amp; D.

D.S. Believe time has come for further cut in housing subsidies. The earlier cut hasn’t sufficiently reduced p’mmes. We can say therefore tht. further cut won’t imperil bldg by l.a.’s.

Wd. wish to announce after Debate on Address – or at least after amendmts tabled.

[Exit R.T.

[Enter AR. Low

2. Agricultural Policy.

H.M. First ques : is it worth giving long-term assurances at all – for, with annual review as now, it puts a floor for us &amp; leaves them to reach for the ceiling. On other hand, it may give confidence to rank &amp; file.

H.A. Objects: i) to give farmers more confidence in long term

ii) reduce scope of annual reviews.

iii) eliminate sp. reviews.

One weakness in present system : limited to 1 year. Doesn’t make sense in reln. to farming cycle of 3-7 yrs.

We have tried for years to sell our policies to farmers, but we haven’t succeeded. What they want is to know prices for 3 yrs ahead &amp; to know tht. increased costs will be followed by increased prices. We can’t ever give them that.

All this scheme will do is to assure farmers tht. existg. policies will continue. They will have to. Won’t therefore cost Ty. more than they wd have to pay anyway.

What shd. we get in return? Admn. fr. farmers tht. these proposals

x| meet the need. We must get that.

Soundest element = capital grants.

Horticulture : accept H.M.’s view – broadly same treatment, but exclude glass etc.,

96% is minimum needed for x/. Also want discriminatory capital grants.

153

R.A.B. Regret continuance of annual reviews. This is really only a new version of minimum prices.

Total value 97% : but 95% of guaranteed price?

H.A. Farmers look at individual prices, not total.

Believe anything over 4% reductn. wd. alarm them. Means that individual price cd. drop by 12% over 3 years. Too steep. And we shdn’t in fact want to make more than 4% decrease.

H. We cdn’t cut wheat by more than 3/= over 3 years. This wd. make it v. diff. to settle with Australia. P.T. will want to consider that.

H.A. I wd. accept 97% on meat &amp; 95% on grain. But N.F.U.’s want a uniform figure for all. [Enter S.Ll.

H.M. The double figure wd. be more easily justifiable.

Low. But same diffy. on tariffs with meat as with wheat.

H.A. But whatever our import diffies., we cdn’t cut much on our meat prices (domestic).

Agreed : H.A. to consider differential basis – 97% - 95%

and report further.

H.M. Capital grants. Hope we can stand at outset on 33⅓%. Much of it will go to landlords. Can’t distinguish, among them, betwn large &amp; small. Ready to take powers in legn. to introduce differential scheme later.

H.A. Want imaginative scheme.

Agreed : H.A. Cttee. to consider plan.

H.M. Accept need for long-term assurances.

Consider differential system vice 96%.

Accept need for cap. grants – but don’t wish to depart fr. principle of flat rate.

H.A. Cttee. to discuss – Mon. (with M/Ed.) Cabinet next week.

[Exit Str., Low.

[Enter A.H.

3. Suez Canal.

S.Ll. Sec. Council. Principles were useful : incldg. 3rd. and Suez Canal Co. recognn. In 2nd. part : endorsemt. of 18 and invitn. to E. to put fwd. proposals : Vote 9:2. Tho’ we have avoided mediators etc., E. has bn. invited to submit alternatives – and will prob. do so. To that extent we are tied. Diffy. on this : Fr. don’t want negotiated settlement – tho’ they have publicly said they will consider E. proposals.

154

P.M. x| Our public attitude : approve 2nd. part of resoln. : ready to talk to E. on

| that basis but on no other.

S.Ll. SCUA. U.S. line is tht. 90% of receipts shd. be paid to E. No element of pressure in that.

P.M. Statement in H/C. on U.N. Presumably on lines of x/ : we expect proposals fr. E. &amp; want them soon.

S.Ll. Say : willing to continue talks with E. as soon as precise proposals are submitted.

P.M. Must ensure tht. Fr. agree with statement on those lines. Joint Anglo-Fr. commn. to Sec. Genl? – and publish.

Keep initiative. S.Ll. did v. well to avoid worse outcome in S.C. Wdn’t wait for H/C. – 23/x. Shd. show over week-end that we are keeping thing moving.

Announce our attitude in speech by S.Ll. Saty. Tell Fr. in advance what we shall say.

H.M. And tell E. we await their proposals. For Sec. Council 2nd. para. was vetoed – &amp; technically they aren’t under invitn. to submit proposals. In that event – terms must be agreed with French.

S.Ll. Situation in Jordan – unstable. E. influence has caused J. to w’draw invitn. to Iraq troops. Done our best to persuade I. not to attack J. The J. submission to S.C. – we must seek to delay it.

P.M. We cd. advise Iraq to send these troops fwd. But grave risk tht. I. mght attack. Our posn. , under Treaty, wd. be quite impossible.

This is main reason why we went to Paris.

Tel 2131 W’ton: shows U.S. wd. run out of Tripartite : and Fr. have told us they cdn’t act v. Israel. Dare we take this risk.

But Jordan may go over to E. this week-end.

Israel can’t accept extensn. of N.’s influence. We tried to secure in Paris tht., if I. moves, she will not move v. Jordan but v. Egypt. B. Gurion this a.m. has said : E. is our main enemy. I. may therefore go for E. quite soon

S.Ll. Advise no further advice re Iraq troops before elections on Sunday. If I. attacked E., we needn’t aid E. under Tripartite because she has declined our aid.

P.M. We have made it plain to I. thro’ French tht. in this event we shd. not feel obligated to E.

If J. shd. go over to E., it wd. strengthen I.’s resolve to go for E.

Don’t want denounce Treaty while we have Suez on our hands.

R.A.B. But what do we do with Br. troops in J.

155

P.M. Shd. have plans to w’draw R.A.F.

H.M. Have avoided in S.C. all limiting amendmts.

We must press E. for proposals &amp; seek to bring issue to a head. For we can’t m’tain our mil. prepns. for many more weeks.

Or I. may bring it to a head. But if they don’t act, and we can’t, we shall have to go over to some quite different basis.

R.A.B. Don’t under-value principles.

P.M. Or, under 2nd. part, “prompt” &amp; “no less effective”.

[Enter J.H.

4. Hong Kong : Riots in Kowloon.

P.M. Time to be tough with Chou.

S.Ll. F.O. Tel. 737 to Peking.

P.M. Chou may try to start a Cyprus in H. Kong.

2 Austr. carriers in area. Wise to put them in.
