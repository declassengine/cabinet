C.M. 53 (56) 26th July, 1956

1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.

P.M. Business for next week.

30/7. Sel. Cttee. on Procedure : Ll.G. to spk – J.S. to be present.

W.M. 31/7. Defence debate. Oppn. now want to restrict it to man-power. Will not raise wider ques of strategy or economies.

P.M. W.M. to open for Govt. I.M. might reply, or A.H. acc. to form of motion.

A.L.B. 1/8. on Consol. Bill : debate on Ch. Justice of Seychelles. He is a bad egg but won’t take any hint to resign. I haven’t instigated local enquiry : there isn’t evidence to warrant it. Tho’ usually tight, he hasn’t bn. drunk in court.

1/8. debate on Motor Industry. Also on Seretse Khama. Spkers (P.T. or I.M.) according.

P.M. Dates of Recess.

2. Industrial Disputes : Motor Industry.

I.M. 760 less men at work to-day. This is good because many are starting their holiday &amp; wd. have expected figure to be larger. Week will end in posn. of defeat for Unions. They have lost face &amp; won’t regain it.

B.M.C., feeling they have won, are ready to make a gesture fr. posn. of strength. They wd. accept talks under M/L. official chairmanship.

I wd. indicate, in reply to P.Q. this p.m., willingness to have such mtg.

Press is likely to reflect this view.

P.M. Avoid impn. tht. Govt. will intervene. Put it on basis tht., if 2 sides now wish to come together, M/L. will facilitate it.

I.M. Only concession B.M.C. wd. make wd. prob. be offer to consult more fully in future on redundancy.

D.S. Durg. Election people expected us to deal more firmly with industrial unrest. See diffies. But cd. we not take this chance to act in support of right to work. Indignn. at picketing &amp; intimidation. Cd. we not have Cttee. of Ministers to consider this. Get a plan of action wh. cd. be put into effect at this, or some other appropriate, opportunity.

I.M. Opinion in Unions is moving twds. greater security of tenure. Effect of this strike will be better than D.S. supposes. Some Unions are cross with T.&amp;G.W. Union : but they wd. all stand together if we took action.

78

P.M. I agree. Action by us wd. have opposite effect to what we want.

H.M. We have done well to avoid more accusations of responsibility – thro’ financial policy. Not much disposn. to argue they have right to work indefinitely in same job. Rest on that achievement.

P.M. Consider D.S. suggn. at later Cabinet. Don’t repeat mistake of T.U.Bill after 1926 strike.

3. Agricultural Wages.

H.A. Attacked, as expected, for intervention.

In ’48 Labour Govt. put in, as evce., R.S.C. Wh. Paper on Personal Incomes etc., wage restraint and said tht. anythg. inconsistent with that wd. not be recouped at next review. This memo. of evce. was marked confidential. Cdn’t quote, without laying.

P.M. Will discuss with HA. – after Cab.

4. Reform of House of Lords.

L.P. Memo. represents results of Cttee’s discussions.

Alternatives : i) Bill to create life Peers.

ii) more ambitious scheme of reform.

We prefer ii) because i) wd. be open to serious criticism as doing nil. re b’woodsmen. Risk of Labour boycott – applies to each.

Points on scheme ii).

Bill wdn’t go into detail re means of appointmt. of Life Peers. Officials think cdn’t be expd. Mght be re-considered. Initial apptmt. of 75 = minimum selection of hereditary Peers – on personal merit alone.

Special problems. Women.

Payment. Exclude fr. this Bill. Don’t want rigid statutory salary. But para 3 (a) isn’t quite what I meant. Think tht. matter shd. be expld. in public statement before Bill is introduced: a scheme shd. be drawn up &amp; announced.

Right of Peers in reln. to H/C. As in paras. 22-25. There are arguments on both sides. Hence proposal in para. 25. Church of Scotland. Cdn’t have Moderator – too busy already. Wd. therefore involve election by Church – a novel principle. Concln. : do nothg. on this or on Anglican Bishops.

Procedure. The legn., on either basis, wd. be short &amp; enabling. Need some opportunity to explain how it wd. be worked. Suggest debate in H/L. on resolution – to explain &amp; give opportunity to debate. Advantage : if re-action v. hostile, cd. fall back on (i). Best opportunity : in spill-over. But means spill-over wd. have to 3 weeks : viz., one week longer than now proposed. Then a refce. in Q. Speech : &amp; legn. cd. start in H/C.

79

K. Support these views. Need for real 2nd. Chamber – and prefer (ii) on that a/c.

Members of Cab. or former members wd. be included, as hereditary Peers, w’out selection.

D.S. Suggest P.M. shd. also have right to appoint supernumerary Life Peer to get him into Cab.

H. Fear opposn. to manner of selection. Alternative : 2 writs – one to speak &amp; the other to speak and vote. This wd. avoid selection.

D.S. Essential to do this reform. But fear scheme wh. appears to create permanent Tory majority. If we start as proposed by S., cd. we not allow vacancies in whole 400 to be filled by Crown on recommn. of P.M. – so as to secure a House representg. all Parties over the years.

S. Wd. mean gradual extension of hereditary principle. H/L. wdn’t accept it. They wdn’t even have Sc. system.

H.’s suggn. shd. be considered. Diffy : convention on wh. H/L. rests is tht. Queen can’t govern w’out peers. Their advice is by speech &amp; by corporate advice (vote). Contrary to original conceptn. to allow individual Peer to choose betwn. functions.

H. My plan wd. be to leave Peers to choose betwn. 2 difft. writs.

I.M. On anythg. beyond i) Labour Party has in effect a veto – because can boycott its opern. What do they think?

S. Haven’t asked them. But scheme cd. be worked w’out them. Selection Cttee. wd. in fact chose Labour Peers. Labour Party wd. then come round.

K. Wdn’t be Tory majority on Sel. Cttee. That is a strong point.

W.M. H/l. stands pretty high : doesn’t need emergency opern. to make it survive. Doubt if it’s wise to tinker with it. Removal of swamping power may not be popular with Labour.

Inclined to support plan (i), &amp; avoid tinkering further.

D.E. Doubt if labour will co-operate. They are running equality line. Reform of H/L. will be represented as means of strengthening 2nd. chamber. This will present Labour with chance to argue tht. we are strengthening non-elected side of Govt.

S. Don’t accept W.M.’s premise. H/L. is running on v. narrow margin. Whole Labour Oppn. rests on 2 Peers. Some action is needed.

If Labour are going to be as hostile as suggd., they won’t co-operate in i). But doubt if they can afford to appear to be so negative.

80

J.S. Country will support sensible scheme for reformed 2nd. Chamber if Labour haven’t a better alternative. I support plan (ii).

Think Peers shd. have a chance to opt for H/C.

Fear Ch./Scotland dog won’t lie. Point has bn. raised in Scotland. Wd. prefer to see it dealt with in Bill. But at least don’t discard it on basis suggd. in para. 27. We cd. stop at Ch/Scotland because only other established Church. We cd. specify office holders or parsons of specified Churches. Need not have election.

S. Or Ch/Sc. cd. recommend to P.M. names for 2 or more seats in H/L as Life Peers.

K. Elders as well as Ministers wd. be awkward.

H.A. Favour gradual extinctn. of hereditary Peers. Prefer ii). But shd. be influenced, in choice, by readiness of Labour to co-operate.

P.T. Sympathise with W.M. &amp; D.E.

If what we want is more effective Chamber, important thing is to get more people to work the House, not to exclude b’woodsmen.

Therefore prefer i). Or even creatg. more Labour Peers. Wdn’t. wish to provoke greater controversies over tinkering.

L.P. Swamping. Wd. be ready to consider some plan.

P.M. I still want reform. Must, however, consider attitude of Parties. Wd. come in context of action on c.p. Labour may argue tht. purpose = enable H/L. to do more such things. My guess : H.G. won’t want to touch this. Wd. like to keep open the choice between i) &amp; ii).

Sympathise with D.S. view. But fact is tht. S. can’t get H/L. to come any closer – and no-one else cd. have done as much.

Doubt if Labour will co-operate, unless C.R.A. takes v. strong line.

S. If you do i) – the c.p. argument isn’t met. The b’woodsmen wd. remain. On that debate, some took oath in order to vote.

P.M. Inside H/L. posn. is not good. But outside, reputn. is high.

D.S. No objn. in country to i) life Peers ii) limitn. of no. of hereditary Peers. Why not do ii) and take power to do i) without numerical limit.

S. Have said I will try to see Cttee. of hereditary Peers next week. I cd. sound them on x/.

We cd. try i). But I would greatly regret not doing ii). Wd. give us best 2nd. Chamber in World. Can’t avoid a conservative majority in 2nd. Chamber

H.M. Hereditary Peers won’t vote for their own extinction.

Hereritary right to govern is outmoded &amp; indefensible.

Need for a 2nd. Chamber is clear.

81

Wide support for principle of life Peers. Much to be said, nowadays, for not apptg. any more hereditary Peers.

Principle of allowg. h. Peers to choose 50% of H/L. won’t be accepted by public opinion.

I wd. therefore legalise life Peers and proceed to act on it.

Every Labour man who has recently accepted Peerage wd. have preferred life Peerage.

Why not do (i). Make no more hereditary Peers.

P.M. If we did i) – cd. we later go on to ii) when it settled down?

L.P. May be. What I shd. regret wd. be to leave unsettled the rather discreditable feature of absentee Lords.

K. Can’t have effective 2nd. Chamber of 1000 or more.

Independence of speech, v. valuable, remains now only in H/L. Can’t have it now in H/C.

Sal. And the independence comes in part from hereditary element.

S. Can you easily justify paymt. w’out restn. of membership?

H.M. Is there any method of selection of heredy. Peers other than by themselves.

L.P. About 50% of Chairmen of Banks are l. Peers.

H.M. Cd. Crown select the limited no. of l. Peers.

Agreed : Resume discn. next week.

5. Jordan.

S.Ll. J. have bn. offered R. arms free. Suggest we tell them that, if they accept, we shall have to re-consider subsidy.

P.M. If we take this line, we must be firm.

S.Ll. x/ Suggest we say it is violation of Treaty in wh. we cdn’t acquiesce.

P.M. Want it to be quite clear tht. they won’t get the money if they do accept.

S.Ll. They will then ask if we will get them arms. We cd. promise to do what we can.

Agreed at x/. Consider telling King as well as Govt.

6. Buraimi

82

S.Ll. Must answer. Say we can’t accept neutral zone or S. sovereignty : but ready to put B. higher on agenda &amp; [to discuss access to sea.]

This may bring us to Sec. Council. They won’t be satisfied with it.

P.M. Wise to mention [ ] if it’s unlikely to give us result.

S.Ll. Puts us in more reasonable light if it comes to Council. Wdn’t. upset Sheikh of Qatar unduly.

Agreed.

[Enter H.W.

7.

Transport : London Fares.

H.M. B.T.C. want to make limited increase in fares.

H.W. Cab. authorised me to allow this. B.T.C. wanted to do it before Bank Hol. I want to allow them to do it afterwds. It is designed to remove old anomalies. No fare will increase by more than 2d. Effect on average is 7% increase. Not an overall increase. Yield £1½ M. Takes the Ldn. Transpt. out of red. They have announced intentn. to do it.

It is not a general increase.

K. Cd. you time it to coincide with end of rlway standstill of 6 months.

H.W. Was implied in my statement &amp; theirs tht. it wd. be done at end/July.

L.P. Don’t announce w’in few days of Parlt. rising. Better in 2nd. or 3rd. week of August.

H.W. Cd. be 16th. vice 9th.

I.M. Support 16th. Aug.

P.M. Better in 3rd. week.

Agreed : mid. Aug. - to begin 1/9.

8. Local Government Re-organisation.

P.M. As in minute from D.S.

9. Capital Punishment. [Enter Att.G.

K. Discussed with colleagues. They support memo. Believe it will carry a good no. of supporters who favoured abolition.

Can Ch. Whip take soundings? 83

P.T. Need you have h’breaking as well as f’arms.

K. L.C.J. &amp; Sc. Judge are broadly in agreement with this approach.

P.M. Believe this is too much to get thro’.

K. H.A. &amp; I.M. thght it wd. do.

Ll.G. My soundings (few) support that view.

D.S. We must assume we lose all Labour support.

E.H. It’s a v. narrow calculn. - &amp; can’t be attempted w’out talking to each. Abolitionists are not v. co-operative.

L.P.S. dislikes this. Feels it won’t prevent Silverman going on again. That will consume much time in next session.

L.P. If we don’t act, we shall lose much moderate opinion.

H.M. We must have some principle. Can’t take moral criterion. Can we not build on law &amp; order. Even abolitionists accept c.p. for treason.

K. This is principle on wh. we have worked.

J.S. This is why I have bn. against retaining it for poisoning.

Ll.G. This wd. reduce hangings by at least 50%.

P.M. Reluctant to jump in on this in last week of Session.

E.H. Need to be clear before Party Confce.

P.M. Cd. keep it open there.

Agreed : Ch. Whip to take soundings on basis tht. we

haven’t decided.
