C.M. 92 (56) 29th November, 1956

Suez Canal. [Enter E.H., P.M.G.

R.A.B. Mtg. of 1922. Section disposed to “go it alone”. Mtg. of F.A. Cttee. at 10.15 p.m. Party is unaware of our likely decision.

Shd. S.Ll. attend mtg. at 10.15?

Nos. of solid “go it alone” group = 30 or more. But 100 or more others are uncertain.

E.H. Sanity is working thro’. But a hard core is v. determined.

R.A.B. At ’22, S.Ll. put pros &amp; cons. of going it alone or acceptg. U.N./U.S. decisions.

S.Ll. Have spoken to N. York. i) Told Dixon tht. if any doubt of discriminn. v. our ships (Nasser threat on basis tht. we are “still at war”), all bets are off. Similar repns. in W’ton.

ii) Told Dixon H. must give us clearer assurance on clearance of Canal.

J.S. L. Heald : we can hand-over, head for head, for some days. M’while U.N. cd. go on with clearing Canal.

A.H. But we are thinkg. of 15 day opern.

S.Ll. Not finally committed. We cd. take out 5.000, and see what they will do on clearance to match it?

I.M. What U.S. response to that?

S.Ll. Wd. delay it, but mght have to accept that, to avoid max. trouble in Party.

R.A.B. Out intentn. shd. be made clear on Monday. Otherwise we shall get no benefit.

L.P. If, on vote, we lose by votes of right we shall be finished for years. In that event, I wd. sooner go on.

Agreed. 1) After discussion, agreed tht. S.Ll. shd. attend mtg at 10.15. p.m. even if he doesn’t speak – except for informn. on pts of fact.

2) Agreed : Cab. to meet at 12 noon, Friday, at H/C.

3) Await further informn. on points i) and ii) above. Have also told U.S. they must be firm on i).

A.H. Party points are i) clearance before w’drawal.

ii) U.S. anxiety lest we decide to “sit it out”.

They must be v. worried about our leaving

U.N. or N.A.T.O.

206

iii) Have we played our last card – viz. S.Ll.

finding on return a Party &amp; Govt. resolutely

opposed to unconditional w’drawal. If we &amp;

French said this firmly to U.N. &amp; U.S., wd.

they not make a concession on (i)? Cd. that

card still be played?

H.M. On basis : clearance proceeds at greatest practicable rate? i.e. without reference to w’drawal.

A.H. Not good enough if they see to it tht. clearance begins when last Br./Fr. soldier leaves.

S.Ll. Hamm. has said tht. U.N. side of clearance will begin as soon as we give a firm date for w’drawal.

D.S. Won’t our pol. crisis be over before last day of w’drawal.

A.H. No. Because, once we have given a date, E. will see to it tht. clearance doesn’t start until the day after. Then we shall be humiliated.

A.L.B. Agree. That is point on wh. Nasser will boast.

D.E. Assurance fr. U.S. is what matters – for Clay &amp; McCloy won’t heed Hamm.

L.P. But U.S. Govt. wdn’t give assurance, on matter in respons. of U.N.

D.S. Nasser will claim victory as soon as we announce w’drawal. He won’t care about clearance.

R.A.B. This is responsibility of U.N. What can we get from them?

Ll.G. Cd. H. be persuaded to repudiate E. condn. of no clearance before w’drawal is complete?

S.Ll. Offer to begin w’drawal, but go at 1.000 p.d. : &amp; review situation after 5 days.

D.S. But then we are militarily non-viable.

H. Get assurance fr. H. that, as soon as surveyors identify next object for clearance, work will start on it.

I.M. We must decide wtr “go it alone” group mirror opinion in country. I believe they do. Tho’ I know they are wrong. Therefore, if we are to fall, we had better fall with them – thro’ being too stiff, not too soft.

207

R.A.B. But shd. we advocate policies we think are wrong merely because we believe they are well supported in country?

Our aim before Mon. shd. be to get more on clearance.

H.M. Suppose you’ve made a deal – &amp; then try to get more on one clause – you may lose the whole deal. Claim that we have secured our objectives. Otherwise, we may lose all.
