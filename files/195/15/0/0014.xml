C.M. 50 (56) 17th July, 1956

1. East-West Trade : China. [Enter E.H., Low, Brooks

S.Ll. At Cocom, all in favour save U.S., Japan and (silently) Canada. Those who favoured it made it clear they wd. regard it as precedent.

Firms want decn. by 19/7. Disclosure before Congress rises at end/July wd., however, be desirable.

L. Firm order 151 : answer needed by 19/7. Another 150 in view. Danger of publicity comes fr. Ch. Embassy, not from R ours.

S. U.S. opinion disturbed. Believe us to have moved further twds neutralism than we have. UK/US reflns. are vital to Br. policy. Decn. is v. diff.

P.M. Ridiculous posn. R. can supply : Czechosl. will. We cd. ourselves supply them to R. bloc and let them forward them. M’while unemplt. in industry.

S.Ll. Nervous of support we had in Cocom.

L.

Was limited to supply to Ch. of goods that can go to Russia.

P.M. Can we hold that posn.

What effect on U.K./U.S. relns. of re-actions here to a refusal of licence.

S. Wd. it help to tell U.S. at same time of our intns. re China in U.N.

P.M. Wd. sooner not have that announced before U.S. Election. Attitude of a new U.S. Adminn. mght be different.

S. Cd. we give licence &amp; defend it on basis that we limit supplies to China to what we cd. freely send to Russia.

S.L. We asked Cocom for leave for 300. We cd. say tht. on re-examn. we have decided to give only 150, for time being. Or less if practicable. Agreed.

L. 50 crawler tractors. Powerful. Don’t yet know latest date for acceptance of that order. Shd. like to tell firm there is hope but can’t say before Aug. They are not on embargo list at all.

Agreed : try to keep this in play.

2. Aswan Dam.

67

S.Ll. U.S. views are much in line with ours. We shall have to tell E. tht., given their other exp’re, this wd. be beyond their resources. U.S. are fairly firm against going forward.

Indicns. that R. are not v. keen to come in on it, after all.

May mean a breach with E., wh. might damage U.K. trade.

L. That wd. not be over-riding.

S.Ll. * May have a memo. for Cab. on Thursday.

3. Legislative Programme. [Enter A.J.

E.H. Police Pay will move up to List A. Also law of murder.

Suggest tht. all these be cleared for policy discn. and drafting (viz. A &amp; B).

K. 15 days short of time without H/L reform. L.P.S. assumed 25 days’ short with H/L. : but Bill we now contemplate wd. not take 10 days.

Even so, if new Bills come in, somethg. Must be dropped fr. List A. We shd. therefore begin to make tentative selection of 5 major Bills in para. 6.

Ll.G. Wd. be ready to p’pone Betting because of developmts. Wd. sooner go on with Shops Hours Bill.

H.A. Agriculture may be affected by events before Q. Speech.

S. Wd. welcome further discn. on this p’mme. Cap. Pun. mght affect H/L. Reform. And better of our alternatives would require co-opn. of Oppn. – wh. cdn’t be obtd. in atmosphere of bitterness.

D.S. x/ Hope Rent can go fwd. at start of Session, as previously agreed.

K. Govt. Re-Organn: can be removed from List A. Tho’ Finance may have to be dealt with.

If doubts about x/, shd. like them resolved before end/July.

A.J. We shall be criticised for inaction if we do not do Electricity.

Agreed – as above.

Resume discn.next week.

4. Agriculture : Wage Claim.

H.A. Wrote F. Union to say tht. if wage increase, they mustn’t assume either a special review or full re-coupment. Unions claim this is

68

attempt to intervene in wage claim. Will make a row over this – P.Q.’s Thursday.

Agreed : stand firm.

5. Industrial Disputes.

Motor Industry.

I.M. Strike called for Mon. Won’t bite for 3 wks because annual holiday.

Unions have asked me to intervene.

Issue is narrowg. down to compensn. BMC may be ready to consider that. Hope now of some compromise.

P.M. Is it wise to speak of “compensation”?

I.M. Severance paymts – not unusual or novel.

Steel Industry.

I.M. Conflict betwn. producers &amp; m’tenance men – latter led by AEU and E.T.U.

Favour Ct. of Enquiry – tho’ unlikely to end the argument. They may however call off ban on overtime until end/dispute. But bitter inter-Union conflict, after Rpt., is likely. – if there is recommn. for joint negotn. of wages.

We are not out of the wood. [Exit Low.

6. Capital Punishment.

K. Reported provisional conclns. of Cttee. Will continue consn. &amp; report further on Thursday. Ch. Whip wd. then take soundings re amount of support fr. Tory abolitionists. With a view to announcemt before recess.

J.S. will wish to reserve his posn. re law in Scotland.

S. Shan’t be able to consult Cantuar before Thursday.

K. Better to see him after Cab.
