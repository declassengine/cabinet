C.M. 39(56). 5th June, 1956.

1. Ministers : Superannuation Rights. [Enter E.H.

P.M. Indicated nature of problem.

Will any member of Cabinet who has such a problem give details of

his case to N.B.

Other Ministers are being asked by L.P.S. and Chief Whip.

R.A.B. Hope we can allow continuance of arrangemts. by which Minister and

firm continue contns.

2. Foreign Affairs.

S.Ll. a) Bahrain. Going well

b) Saar. Looks as tho’ agreement will be reached.

c) Syria. A bad new Govt. Urging Iraq to take some firm action

(Nuri Said). We must work thro’ him. Majority of Syrian

Parliament are of pro-Iraq party.

3. Cyprus.

P.M. Worried at unhealthy state of public opinion in U.K.

Govr : security angle going well &amp; likely to improve.

public opinion: of concern, both here &amp; in U.S.

We must consider steps to educate opinion :-

a) In Party : we can work thro’ Cttees. etc.,

b) In U.K. : can facts be put out thro’ C.O.I.? C.O. to

consider.

c) In U.S. : B.I.S. mght help e.g. on facts relatg. to Bishop of

Paphos, now in N. York. Why shd. U.S. support French

on Algeria but criticise us on Cyprus.

Also on b) : Ministers to put facts in speeches : C.O. to promote this.

4. Somalia.

S.Ll. No future in trying to extend Italian trusteeship.

Wd. affect our reputn. on Colonialism.

Agreed.

[Enter T., R.M.

5. Nuclear Tests.

L.P. Strontium. Now 1.2 units maximum in humans. If no more tests, this

wd. rise to 4 in 10 years. But, if tests continued, to 10. At that

point, not earlier, there wd. be cause for some action.

13

S.Ll. U.S. have suggested p’ponement of announcement. Can’t agree to

that, in light of impendg. publn. of reports.

A.L.B. Leaked already. W. Samoa is petitioning U.N. to stop test.

P.M. Best hope of reducg. defence exp’re is to go on with deterrent. We

must go on.

R.T. Better, however, to defer announcement until report is available. It is

re-assuring.

H.M. Awkward to announce v. soon after publn. : that was our earlier view.

But report is more re-assuring than we then thought.

L.P. But enough in it to warrant people askg. us not to go on, if no decision

taken by then.

P.M. There is a case for limitation.

On balance, better to announce on Thursday. Avoid confusing it with

detailed argument on medical report.

B.H. Will be accused of announcg. deliberately before H/C. knows what is

in report.

P.M. If we wait, we shall be pressed to wait until public have digested

report.

S.Ll. Offer to discuss limitn. Alternative wh. wd. annoy U.S. less : offer to

consider M.R.C. report with U.S., together with results of U.S.

enquiries, &amp; will discuss with other Powers any measures for

control &amp; limitation which these reports may indicate to be

desirable.

L.P. Support that. Will enable U.S. to stall thro’ Election.

P.M. Original formula is better for us &amp; not really v. embarrassing to U.S. :

it is in terms of limitn. only.

S.Ll. It is for L.P. to advise wtr softer answer wd. be better qua U.S. co-opn.

H.M. Alternative wd. involve includg. specific reference to M.R.C. report &amp;

leave us open to comment tht. H/C. haven’t seen it.

P.M. On original formula : insert “either as part of a scheme of general

disarmament” before “or on its own merits”.

L.P. Want to send copy of Rpt. to U.S. authies. in advance.

P.M. No : too dangerous : it is Cmd. Paper. Parlt. wd. be enraged if it

became known.

14

L.P. Alternative formula : dislike reference to M.R.C. report.

P.M. Ready to consider U.S. views, but not beyond the point of saying tht.

we favour discussion on limitation.

Agreed : make announcement on these lines on Thursday.

F.O. and L.P. to settle detailed terms of announcement.

L.P. Inform A &amp; N.Z. of terms of announcement as soon as practicable.

Others : 24 hrs’ before.

H.M. Tell them of para. 1. Para. 2. turns on U.S. consultns. &amp; we can’t give

text in advance because unlikely to be settled. Promise2nd. para.

later.

[Exit R.T.

6. Attendance of M.P.’s at Earlier Tests.

L.P.S. Can we stop them going at own charges, when Austr. M.P.’s will

attend?

W.M. Strain on limited resources. Must be flown in &amp; out at last minute. I

wd. prefer to put 10 Australians in with Press : no V.I.P.

treatment.

D.S. On earlier occasion, tho’ I was in Australia, I refrained from going

myself: and Australian M.P.’s were kept out too.

L.P. Can’t stop that now. Menzies has made special request.

P.M. ? Enough to say : we can’t make special arrangements for our M.P.’s

to visit. Physically impossible.

L.P.S. Can’t ask M.P.’s who want to go at own expense to stay away.

P.M. Can say : no special facilities can be provided. If Crossman etc., want

to go at expense of newspaper, he will have to be treated as Press

men.

[Exit R.M.

[Enter C.

7. Sale of Ships to Spain.

C. 3 cruisers &amp; 12 destroyers: enquiry from Spain: £7½ M : now in un-

maintained reserve.

They wd. probably not buy so many as that.

A.L.B. Govr., Gib. raises no objn.

Agreed : no objn. Definite proposal to be Appd. by D. Cttee.

15

[Exit C.

8. Industrial Disputes : Standard Motor Co.

I.M. Had seemed likely there wd. be strike – against redundancy : an odd

idea &amp; illogical. Now seems there is little local support for this

A.E.U. plan. More likely tht. they will ask me to intervene.

Awkward : for it wd. be wrong to press Co. to take any diff. line.

Reason = fall in demand, not automation.

Norton’s. Also against redundancy. Unofficial strike was collapsing,

&amp; co. tried to hasten it : then A.E.U. made it an official strike.

Men themselves wd. like to go back.

V. good leader on this in D. Mail.

H.M. First sign of credit squeeze – fall in home demand. Unless the product

can be exported, men shd. move to other work. This is what we

want.

I.M. N.I. decision on short-time. Official Cttee. have reported on this. If we

are to act, legn. will be needed.

P.M. Don’t want legn. Surely when Standards dismiss, other firms will

follow suit.
