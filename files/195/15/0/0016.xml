C.M. 52 (56) 24th July, 1956

1. Export of Arms : Germany. [Enter E.H., R.M.

P.M. Argument tht. we shdn’t urge them to have tanks while we stress deterrent. Not much in that. We shall have some tanks.

R.M. If we don’t know by Sept., we shall have to close prodn. line.

x/ Shd. I see G. Amb. here vice visit to G.

Agreed at x/ : R.M. to report result.

[Exit R.M.

2. Bagdad Pact.

S.Ll. Havg. w’drawn fr. Aswan Dam, cd. we show readiness to do more for Bagdad Pact – to stress that we help our friends.

P.M. H.G. will press thesis tht. all aid shd. go thro’ U.N. Don’t want that. We give a lot thru’ U.N. but must be free to help our friends, who will make good use of it.

H. Don’t forget Indus waters.

S.Ll. Have in mind only techn. assistce., as for Colombo Plan.

H.M. India’s 2nd. 5 yr. Plan will be financed fr. st. balances, to larger extent than we had feared. They have £250 M. &amp; mght draw it at 50 M. p.a.

We have no surplus to invest.

Want a Cttee. to decide what we can give &amp; how we distribute it. Wd. have like to tie B. Pact into that.

M’while, cd. we not say tht., while we support internatl. agencies &amp; shall continue to do so, U.S. have system of tied aid thro’ Exp-Import Bank. Then go on to say tht. in our efforts we shall try to help those who are managing economies well &amp; avoidg. overstrain and those who are our friends : &amp; wd. continue to see what help we cd. give to economic side of B. Pact.

S.Ll. Add : considg. what we can do to help that, esp. in techn. assistance.

H.M. Out best contn. eventually wd. be to revive our money market – by increased savings.

[Exit S.Ll.

3. Agricultural Policy.

H.M. Allied with Austr. talks &amp; surge twds Europe.

i) On commercial policy hope to circulate memo., with B/T., before end of month. Avoided premature decn. at O.E.E.C. by acceptg. studies of lower tariff soln. and common market.

74

ii) Austr. problem has supervened. Not clear how we solve that.

iii) Br. agriculture.

Must have plan agreed by end/Sept. For shd. give genl. picture to Comm. Fin. Ministers at Bank mtg. Much work to be done – in Aug: Sept – thro’ new E.P.C. with overseas Dpts. co-opted.

A workable plan, if we cd. achieve it, wd. be as important as Ottawa.

Prelimy. Cab. discussion early in Sept.

In this way we might turn Austr. problem to our advantage. M’while in any discns. with farmers, keep it all as open as we can. Prefer not to go beyond cap. grants &amp; minimum level of commodities. Don’t want early commitment to any fixed figure, of total value guarantee, wh. will leave us insuff. room for manoeuvre.

H.A. Agree with this. Must have some talks – with farmers – committed. Wd. have one mtg. now &amp; adjourn until Sept. Offls. will play it slow.

We shall need, in end, to offer a longer-term agreemt. with farmers.

I wd. adhere to the 2 points in para. 11(i) of C.P. 177. We cd. add tht. we are not against an undertakg. but it wd. need much discn.

P.T. Is min. commodity guarantee consistent with mtg. Austr. on wheat?

H.A. In principle, yes : so long as we don’t go into details of commodities.

P.M. V. awkw. negotn. with Austr. H.M., P.T. &amp; H.A. did v. well. Announcemt. to be made 3/8., envisaging resumed talks in Sept.

Grateful to H.M. for offer of holiday work.

H.A. must play farmers slow, but not too slow.

H.M. Problem : how do we reconcile highly subsidised industry in U.K. with desire to trade with countries who have nothg. to export save agric. products.

Procedure approved : aim at decisions of principle by

mid-September.

H.A. Labour Party may come out with tempting offers for credit. Farmers are borrowg. too much thro’ merchants at excessive rates. Shd. favour, at right moment, enquiry to see wtr facilities for credit for farmers are adequate. Wd. like to take that up with H.M. in autumn. Enquiry wd. take 12 months.

H.M. Yes : later on. M’while link it, in talks, with capital grants.

4. Australia : Trade Talks.

P.T. Official Cttee. &amp; Ministerial. Trying to eliminate non-starter methods. Will keep it in touch with commercial policy.

[Enter H.W. 75

5. Oxford Roads.

D.S. Traffic is ruining Oxford. Completion of outer by-passes will not cure, tho’ it may relieve, problem.

City developments plan made no provn. for this. Govt. asked them for proposals. Their scheme was for 2 roads – across Meadows and Parks. I sought alternative – in talks in Oxford – and persuaded them to produce alternative : the green one. This was torn to bits by Univ. even more savagely than earlier. Univ. voted on alternatives &amp; by small majority agreed tht. green was worse than red.

10-day enquiry thereafter. All points of view fully ventilated.

Inspr. came down firmly in favour of red road. M/T. and I have no doubt tht. from traffic angle this is best solution. As Univ. think the alternative is even more objectionable, no purpose in going further than red road.

Advise therefore rejectn. of compromise plan &amp; telling City we favoured red road, across north of Meadow: which is far from beautiful part of Meadow.

P.M. Developmt. of shops &amp; cinemas in Cowley, as alternative.

D.S. That is being done. I wd. like to close Magdalen Bridge &amp; chop the town into two. But shocking outcry.

A.L.B. When M/T. I favoured completg. outer road, &amp; seeing what that wd. do.

H.W. They won’t cure traffic in High, wh. is not mainly thro’ traffic. Don’t think you cd. close Madgalen Bridge w’out inner relief road.

S. But a propte. amount of thro’ traffic : wh. wd. be relieved by outer ring.

Local shopping traffic – shops in Cowley.

P.M. If we must have red road, can’t we seal off old city.

D.S. We wd. close Magdalen Bridge. Wd. make it a condn. Approved.

S. Wd. prefer to finish outer roads. Then, if this still needed, it wd. be plain that problem is due to Cowley traffic.

Approved – with regret.

[Exit H.W.

6. Local Government Re-organisation.

D.S. Mtgs with l.a.’s over 12 mos. ago. Much pressure for publn. L.A. assocn. mtgs. in Sept : Party Conference – we shall be asked where it is. Must be publd. this session : better now than Oct.

76

Revised &amp; shorter version of paras. on finance.

H.M. Why not say in para. 1 – This deals with organn., not with finance.

D.S. Wd. have to say a little more than that. Ready to put it at beginning. Or an amended title to make it clear it doesn’t deal with finance.

P.M. Doubts wtr we shall be able to announce concln. on finances before end of year.

D.S. V. well : ready to omit it for W. Paper : say merely it is under considn.

Agreed : Give title “Boundaries &amp; Status”. Then no refce.

to finance.

S. Para. 53. In last sentence, vice “might” say “shd. wherever possible”

Agreed.

D.S. Finance comes out.

P.M. Discuss with L.P.S. wtr functions can come out, too.

as Cab. wd. prefer.

If L.P.S. objects, we can discuss in Cab. Thursd.

E.H. No legn. in next Session. Better therefore to publish in Oct. – new session. Then debate cd be averted until after Xmas.

D.S. But qua l.a.’s much disappointmt. We can delay legn. debate on grd. tht. it wd. need to cover functions as well as organn.

Agreed : Publish before Recess.

7. Economic Statistics.

H.M. Wd. like to announce Tues. P.T. to see industry on Friday.

B. H. Have suggd. addn. re bldg. industry – to H.M.

H.M. Will reduce in length.

E.H. Better on Wed.
