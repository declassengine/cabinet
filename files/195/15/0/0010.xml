C.M. 46(56). 28th June, 1956.

1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.

RAB. Business for next week.

Tuesd. Supply. Oppn. will debate economic sitn., with sp. reference to motor trade. Spokesmen : H.M. + either P.T. or I.M. according to terms of motion. May be a motion, as gesture, fr. Tory side.

Thursday : Natd. Industries reports &amp; accounts – motion.

2. Germany : Support Costs.

W.M. Leaking in Bonn. Wd. like to make early statement. Suggest I do it to-morrow (Friday).

R.A.B. Already have our statement for Fri. – on Malta.

P.M. May be said we are evading H/C. by announcg. Friday.

H.M. But will prob. be in Press to-morrow a.m.

Agreed : announce Friday a.m.

F.O. to consider terms (final sentence).

3. Cyprus.

P.M. Mtg last p.m. of Govt. supporters. Ch. Whip was invited. Asked convener (Waterhouse) to see me : suggested he shd. not hold mtg because we were in negotn. : he thght cancelln. wd. do harm. Ch. Whip therefore attended &amp; said Govt. were not in posn. to make a statement, but when it cd. wd. be clear tht. they had taken all steps to safeguard posn. of U.K. &amp; Allies incldg Turkey. M’while damage wd. be done to Govt. cause if pressures contd. This did not satisfy mtg : Waterhouse has since written to me to say so.

What action shd. we take? At mtg. they did decide not to hold another.

M.P.’s don’t understand tht. negotns. are for Executive not Parlt.

Alternatives : I cd. go to 1922 Cttee. this p.m. and ask if Govt. has confidence of Party. May, however, be ill-attended. L.P.S. cd. explain posn. &amp; if he did not obtain satisfn. we cd. summon more formally a Party mtg. next week.

R.A.B. Two groups : one unpleasant : the other (larger) feeling only a vague anxiety about what is going on.

Waterhouse is feeling less certain of support than he was.

I have to go to 1922 anyway on natd. indies. Wd. deal with that, and when Cyprus raised I wd. repeat Ch. Whip’s statement and

46

x| make clear responsibility of Executive for carrying out negotns.

Wd. sooner do this than bring in P.M. at this stage. If it goes on or gets worse, P.M. will intervene with greater effect.

B.H. They need a lecture on x/. Let R.A.B. do it.

H.M. Reserve P.M.’s authority until we reach point of decision and want to push it through.

S. If it’s boiling down, wiser to reserve P.M. for more crucial occasion.

P.M. V. well. But if they don’t accept L.P.S. assurance, we must have formal Party mtg and ask for their confidence.

4. Aden.

A.L.B. Since memo. written, Att.G. &amp; I are seeking means of getting rid of belongers without international diffy. Also, Govr. now proposes rustication on m’land of Aden vice island. That makes it easier. Thus, ask Cab. to leave me to pursue this with lawyers. (Att.G. and K.)

Will submit memo. soon on general ques of Aden &amp; Protectorate.

S.Ll. Consider detention. Don’t want them to get to Cairo.

P.M. Forces in Aden are inadequate. Equivalent of battn. only. I want a formed battalion in addn.

W.M. Will consider &amp; report. [Exit E.H.

5. International Tin Council.

S.Ll. A necessary evil.

Att.G. Tax exemption for individuals will give trouble.

H.M. For the organisation, no diffy. For individuals, Revenue don’t think they can object, but H/C. won’t like it.

But to our advantage to have it here.

[Enter B.C.

6. Nat. Insurance : Unemployment Benefit.

I.M. Consequence of 5-day week. But 4 day emplt. (losing 1 day) entitles him to 2 days’ benefit, as tho’ he normally worked 6 days.

Anxiety mainly over highly paid : no one raised ques over cotton workers. Mobility isn’t really affected. V. controversial legn.

47

My concln. (with B.C.) is tht., if sitn. not affected by f’coming appeal, we shd. re-consider posn. in autumn.

P.M. It’s not benefit tht. holds workers but hope of getting back into highly-paid motor industry.

H.M. V. unsatisf. sitn. Unexpected decn. of Commissioner. Flaw in law wh. wd. ordinarily be corrected by legn. Pity we can’t put it right. Awkward just at moment when we face mobility as an issue. No prospect of legn. before end/July. Against promising it long before we do it. Hope, however, we may agree in principle tht. this gap must be closed &amp; legn. be prepared. So that we be ready to act in autumn.

B.C. Much of this cd. be done by Regn. Easier than legn.

Series of appeals will be heard on 19/7.

H.M. Be ready to act, wtr by Regn. or legn.

P.M. Avoid publicity.

[Exit B.C.

[Enter Selk.

7. White Fish Subsidy.

H.M. My plan wd. give £3 M. subsidy (cpd. £2.3 M.) : wd. concede ¾ of demand : shd. face consequence of run-down of ships (tho’ we needn’t announce that): cd. announce intn. to legislate to assist conversion to oil-burning.

H.A. V. little between us. My comment shd. be considered v. b’ground of political row of last year.

Accept H.M.’s offer of 8d. &amp; other points.

Only real diffce. betw. us is on rate of run-down. We wd. accept £17. But that involves total of £750.000, not £650.000.

Prefer 1963 because loans scheme ends then.

J.S. If assured we can have £17 – wd. accept it, tho’ will cause unemplt. &amp; dislocn. in Aberdeen.

Accept 1962 if I must.

H.M. Ready to accept £17 and leave Ty. to ascertain what total cost wd. be.

Better to spend the money on modernisation. Get M/Ag. to go intothis with Admy. Agreed.

[Exit Ll.G.

8. Malta.

A.L.B. Govr. wd. prefer compromise. I am not. For it wd. commit us to “equivalence” &amp; mght get it written in to constitutional arrangemts.

48

May lead to Election in Malta.

In suggesting to H/C. there wd. be no repercussions in other small Colonies I said this unlikely unless seen tht. Malta obtd. substantial early advantage in economic aid.

Will add to statement tht. I am ready to consider alternative

x| proposals wh. don’t commit me above £5 M. this year but wd.

give more time to consider financial situation. Alternative : vote development loan of £15 M. over 3 yrs., with commn. from U.K. to consider its appln.

H.M. x/ wd. be taken to imply there will be more next year.

P.M. When I saw him &amp; asked what he wd. ask for next year, he said £10M.

K. Malta expert put it to Conference at £5.1 M. Ty. estimate £5 M. We shd. resist this effort to bump it up, with no contn. by Malta itself.

Have you any thing practical in mind on x/?

A.L.B. Not on aid from U.K. But e.g. no need for 100% backing for Currency: this mght yield £3 M.

£5 M. wd. be increase of £¾ M. cpd. with last year.

Probable course : Genl. Election. Govr. cd. not refuse dissolution. Neither side will be helpful, in Election. Mintoff may throw over plan for integration &amp; put fwd. claim to independence &amp; Treaty.

H.M. We may be spending money in Malta on workshops from Canal.

D.S. Soon spend £1 M. if there’s disorder.

H.A. But hopeless to do this, in face of M.’s tactics.

A.L.B. I cdn’t defend it in Parlt. cf. para 2 of my draft statement.

K. M.’s face mght be saved if he re-phased p’mme so as to cost

y| £7½ M over 18 mos. Involves no more for us.

A.L.B. Add that during that period we will have commn. from U.K. to go into

z.| whole ques of economic developmt.

Agreed – as at y and z.

9. Libya.

S.Ll. I settled (subject to ratification) at ¼ £M this year and £½ M. next year (subject to abatement of £¼M on a/c of slower progress with barracks)

On Forces, fought him off on Navy &amp; Air Force by offering examn. byexperts. On Army I promised assistce. twds expansion &amp; will

49

help with training facilities, equipmt &amp; use of installns. – again to be worked out by experts on both mil. and financial experts. Offer to advance periodical review mght have cost us more.

We must review its value to us. We are spendg. a lot on it. Early consultn. then with U.S. – to get common plan for developmt. and subvention.

H.M. Not v. good qua another Arab Legion.

The anticipated saving of £¼ M on barracks is only a p’ponement.

S.Ll. He has promised to consider wtr it cd. be permanent arrangemt. Then it wd. be a saving.

P.M. Agree to x/. Wd. sooner put more reliance on Cyprus &amp; Malta &amp; leave Libya largely to U.S.

[Enter A. Jones.

10. Grand National.

A.J. They want to move fr. Sat. to Fri. – wd. cost 20,000 t. of coal.

P.M. We yielded on Leger.

A.J. Bad moment – with economic situation as it now is.

Tried to persuade N. Hunt Cttee. But we have conceded all other big races.

Agreed : say we hope they won’t do this for another

year., &amp; ask for estimate of their loss.
