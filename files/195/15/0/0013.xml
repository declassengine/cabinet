C.M. 49(56). 12th July, 1956.

1. Police Pay. [Enter E.H.

Ll.G. Under Act of 1919 no power to make an award retrospective. But violent campaign – supported by many Tories in H/C.

First ques : shd. latest award be made retrospective? Cost £1.9 M., of which 50% wd. be on Exchequer. Pressure for this retrospn. is v. heavy.

Objns to retrospectn. That of M/P. has bn. removed. That of M/E. cd. be met if amendg. legn. were not introduced before 1/10.

Recommend : clear statement tht. we intend to legislate in Oct. for future retrospn. What shd. we do on outstandg. award? Don’t want to refuse if we have to give way later.

H.A. In general retrospn. shd. not be extended too widely.

P.M. Yes : but on this procedure time-lag is v. considerable.

H.M. Support H.A. If habit grows, tendency will be to submit claims early. Two separate issues. a) Future. Diff. is refuse to Police, when some others have it. Effect on teachers : if legn. p’poned until next session, we can get round that.

b) Last award. We must take a decn. we can stand on : and announce our decn. v. soon.

Ll.G. Until flaw in law was discovered, many (illegal) retrospective paymts have bn. made in past.

I.M. Decn. won’t embarrass me. Trade Bds etc., have power to make awards retrospective – but don’t necessarily use it or, if they do, make it retrospective to date of claim.

J.S. Can’t make this award retrosp. w’out consultg. l.a.’s – and not certain they wd. agree.

P.M. Don’t like treatg Police meanly on a technicality.

H.M. Once Bill is introduced, imposs. to resist paying this award. But avoid appearg. to push l.a.’s.

Agreed: Ll.G. to announce to-day tht. Govt. have decided

to introduce legn. for future and will consider with

l.a.’s wtr it will be possible in this legn. to provide

for retrospection of last award.

2. Remuneration of Doctors. [Enter R.T.

62

H.M. Since last mtg, consulted other Ministers &amp; agreed a formula – handed round.

S. Can we consider genl. policy on doctor’s salaries. Distorted. Consultants are doing too well in comparison with holders of University posts (medical).

R.T. Unsatisf. But no early prospect of altering it. For can’t put people down.

I.M. Mght consider extendg. merit awards to holders of Univ. posts.

D.E. Omit [ ]. Agreed.

Draft approved, subject to omission of [ ]. [Exit R.T.

3. Australia : Trade Talks.

P.T. Have taken awkward turn. They ask for end of preference system – tho’ wd. give our goods an “edge” thro’ tariffs. In return for that edge, they want better treatment fr. us esp. on wheat: e.g. subsidy on wheat to be subj. to review by Bd. as their tariff, &amp; opportunity for them to put views.

Have told McEwen we don’t think we cd. conclude negotiated agreemt. on this basis.

Even if we gave them good deal on wheat, they wd. not have agreed to meet us on tariffs.

P.M. Menzies has never suggd. anythg. of this kind.

H. Agree : M. told me y’day tht. he only needed elbow-room w’in existg.

preference system. He may be able to call McEwen to order.

P.T. Anyway, we must face substantial redn. in our preferences in

Austr. market.

.M. Some advantage: No chance of agreemt. in detail before M. leaves. We ourselves want a little more time. N.Z. will take similar line if A. gets away with this : and C. don’t like pref. system.

May be wiser to tell M. this opens up way to endg. Ottawa system. Before so serious a step is taken, need for time for both of us to reflect. Suggest mtg. of offls. at end/this year. Shd. not discard only econ. link in Comm. w’out thght.

H. …… M. doesn’t want an agreemt. this week.

Agreed: P.M. to see Menzies. [E.H. Exit

63

4. Europe : Economic Co-operation.

H.M. We accepted oblign. to liberalise – on quotas. They now want to move on to tariffs. We wd. find that embarrassing. Wise preliminary to go to 90% liberalisation (cost £1-1½ M. for U.K. and similar amount in Colonies : about £3 M. in all). This wd. give us more control over rest of discussion.

Plan for handling that is set out in C.P. 171. Get some other country to propose review e.g. Norway : then we cd. agree. Avoid appearance of important new U.K. initiative.

P.T. Won’t be so easy in Paris. I shall have to argue in oppn. to a round of m.f.n. tariffs talks.

P.M. French may support us on that.

H. V. ingenious tactics qua Commonwealth.

P.T. Hope we can discuss in Cab. before Recess our general commercial Policy.

5. Judicial Salaries.

K. Two outstandg. ques i) Met. Mags. ii) Sheriffs Substitute.

Timing : C. Service salaries are coming into force now. V. largely by stealth: minimum of announcement. Some judicial apptmts. cd. be adjusted accordingly w’out publicity. But for these people &amp; Co. Ct. Judges legn. is needed : &amp; if my proposal is not accepted they will have to wait 12 mos. cpd. with the others. Propose therefore legn. next Session with retrospective effect fr. date of an announcemt. in July.

Lawyers in H/C. will raise this &amp; be able to make a strong case. These people are not at present adequately paid.

P.M. We are trying for stability. F.B.I. statement to-day, quite good. Followed by a joint mtg. Also turning down remuneration of M.P.’s. Cd. it not wait until autumn.

K. Cd. I say to their leaders tht. we will do this by legn. next Session. Cd. be said in confidence.

V. diff. in view of C. Service.

H.M. On timing : where does this end? In ’52 we fixed £2.500 for Met. Mag : now, despite redn. in income tax, we have to admit another £1.000.

We accepted Priestley as a package – and because we shd. have done worse at arbitn.

We can’t restore value of £ : most = hold it. Don’t therefore defeat our attempt to do it.

64

Wdn’t resist the minor points of diffce. But on timing of action, it wd. be disastrous to do this now. Hold it, even for 6 mos.

Junior Minister has much higher claims than these. Example in this is more than logic.

At least say nothg until next session.

K. Cd I not then tell them this?

J.S. V. diff. to hold position. Can’t get enough people for these posts. We have bn. playing this along for more than a year.

K. Salaries have always bn. related to C. Service scales.

H.M. Real reason for increasg. C.S. salaries was competn. of industry. Is the counter-attraction of Bar so formidable.

What about dusty answer to doctors? How wd. that compare.

K. Will consider ques, in light of Cab.’s discussion.

S. In the end justice will have to be done for these.

If effort at stability fails, shd. have to do this.

H.M. C. &amp; A.G. wd. have to be included in this.

K. On relativities : last increase was too small. net receipt to-day is less than it was pre-war.

[Enter R.M.

6. Germany : Supply of Tanks.

P.M. We agreed in Def. Cttee. to m’tain a factory – against G. orders.

R.M. Yes : but in 2 mos., w’out another order, we shall have to close it.

P.M. Then, as U.S. have got aircraft order, shd. we ask U.S. to encourage G. to place tank orders with us.

R.M. Wd give us £70-80 M. over 4 years.

U.S. have offered to sell surplus tanks at a low price.

S.Ll. Discussed in Export Cttee. &amp; have instructed H.M. Amb. in Bonn. But cd. be supplemented by message to Eis.

P.T. Plenty of other work: for steel &amp; skilled men.

J.S. But diff. area. Small import content.

H.M. Bonn Tel. 522. Await result of talk?

H. What is policy re run-down. India cd. take more.

65

R.M. Only few – cpd. with German order.

Agreed : Pursue German possibility on lines agreed. Don’t

stimulate orders from India.

7. Cyprus.

P.M. Proposed new para. 5 for Parly. statement.

Approved.

8. Nuclear Tests.

S.Ll. Nutting in N. Yk. went much less far than Cab. accepted y’day.

P.Q. to-day. Proposed draft reply.

Even this may upset Amercians – who want it kept w’in comprehensive agreemt.

P.M. Provided our essential def. needs are safeguarded, H.M.G. are ready to accept any discns. acceptable to other Powers concerned.

Or, better, repeat my earlier statement.
