C.M. 85(56). 20th November, 1956.

1. The Prime Minister. [Enter E.H., Ch. Hill, Reading

R.A.B. Sympathy to P.M. Don’t know how things will go – must wait a few days. No recurrence of earlier physical troubles. Nervous exhaustion. Absolute need for rest.

Agreed : sympathy – best wishes for earliest practicable

return.

2. Suez Canal.

D.E. What line do we take on “collusion”?

R.A.B. Nil to add to what S.Ll. said in H/C. on 31/10. P.M. wd. be opposed to any Cttee. or formal enquiry.

I.M. Cd. we not say more in defence? The “evidence” is pretty shoddy. Cd. we not say : of course we knew of I.’s intentions &amp; took precautions accordingly. But no prior agreement, no promises of territorial changes, no incitement to I. to attack.

R.A.B. Cd. consider that on S.Ll.’s return – but not earlier. Want to avoid further statements in H/C. on Suez until then – Thurs. or Friday.

R.A.B. Read reply wh. P.M. proposes to send to Bulganin’s note of 15/x.(?)

Approved.

3. Independent Television Authority.

Brief discussion – not noted.

R.A.B. P.M. doesn’t like this – but is content that Cab. shd. decide. Recommend we accept PMG.’s view – and pay £100.000.

H.M. Add to public announcemt. tht. this aid is only temporary.

Agreed.

[Exit P.M.G.

[Enter A.J.

4. Oil Supplies.

H.M. Supply posn. is uncertain. Have made 10% cut. Must now go fwd. on assumptn. that 25% cut will have to be made effective. Rationing therefore is inevitable.

186

A.B. Statement to-day – after Questions. Correspg. statement in H/L.

Basic ration for private cars : 200 m. p. month: to avoid numerous supplements.

P.T. Hope to avoid drop in steel production.

Main diffy. for industry will be over transport – switch to rail.

R.A.B. Demand for debate is likely. Next week.

Is there hope of m’taining supplies up to 75%?

A.B. U.S. unofficial opinion that original plan may be carried out informally up to 75% or 90% of original planned performance.

H.M. U.S. official reluctance to help is justified by i) fear of Saudi reaction while we are at odds with U.N. ii) pressure on us to accept their political desiderata (not yet clear what those are).

We shan’t get any change out of U.S. until decn. taken on H.’s mission to Nasser.

5. Economic Situation.

H.M. Outlined b/p. situation &amp; indicated alternative courses. Recommended that we should hold on, pro. tem.

On mid-term, we can’t hope to get any help from U.S. until political relns. between us are restored. M’while, all we can do is interim informal approach by Harcourt. Aim at statement on 4/12 that we intend to ride out this storm : using the reserves for this purpose (i.e. crisis) – wh. is justified because not being used to deal with underlying unsound economic situation.

D.S. Danger of delay?

H.M. Great. But hopeless to seek U.S. aid before pol. atmosphere has cleared.

R.A.B. Agree – can’t hope to do any business with them until about 3 wks. have passed.

D.E. U.S. opinion outside official circles is beginning to turn in our favour. Cd. we not mobilise that feeling, thro’ B.I.S.?

R.A.B. F.O. to consider that.

6. Commercial Policy.

A.L.B. Content with Cab. decision of last week. But:-

187

i) Wd. be happier if at same time we were freeing ourselves of the GATT handicaps wh. prevent our being more active in Comm. economic co-opn. – e.g. the no-new-preference rule.

ii) No concession can be made on exclusion of foodstuffs.

iii) Colonial ques. May be pressure to bring other people’s Colonies in the free trade area. That wd. give rise to v. gt. diffies. for our Colonies. My consent is conditional on our resistg. this.

Have consulted Colonies. Many (smaller) have no views. Some (larger) have put fwd. views summd. in Annex II of main memo. These must not be overlooked.

R.A.B. P.M. is ready that we shd. go ahead as agreed last week.

P.T. On (i), remember tht. it wd. antagonise Canada v. much – not to mention U.S.

On (ii), no one will advocate free trade in f’stuffs. Pressure will be for reguln. on lines which Br. agric. have bn. inclined to favour.

On (iii), we have good arguments with wh. to resist pressure. E.g. they wdn’t wish to see H. Kong in a free-trade area.

Sal. Canadian re-action implies an extraordinary detachment fr. Commonwealth.

Possibly an argument in favour of a new initiative.

H.M. Form of debate. Better to do it on the adjournment. Agreed.

Mon. 26th Nov.

7. Gold Coast.

H. Independence celebrations. Member of R. Family and a Cab. Minister will have to be present – March.

But now appears that Nasser &amp; Chou-en-lai have bn. invited.

A.L.B. Since our submission to P.M. was made, have heard Nkruma’s plans for other guests. These were laid before Suez.

Agreed : Resume discussions later.

8. Colonial Immigrants.

K. As in memo.

On state of immigration generally, debate in H/L. to-day. Proposed to say we are still watching posn.

A.L.B. Letters they send home are less rosy in terms. Balance of immigration has turned in last year in favour of women &amp; children vice men.

L.P. Still concerned. Agree we can’t tackle it now. But we shd. watch it.

188

On Irish – if we do have the general legn., mght. be diff. to avoid altering their position. On pledges – I made a statement differing from those by A.E., &amp; K.

R.A.B. Suggest Cttee. reviews position in 3 months.

Agreed : M/L. to be associated with Cttee. because of

possible change in economic situation.

D.S. I assume there is no agreement on Cttee’s. recommns. re Ireland.

9. Marketing of Pigs and Bacon.

H.A. Propose now to present this on Mon. vice Tues.

Name or organn. – Authority or Board.

10. Agricultural Policy.

H.A. Propose to present this on Tues., vice Mon.

Leaders of farmers are pleased. We shall be pressed for concessions on credits. X/ On this I wd. have liked an independent enquiry. For Labour will produce facile policy for cheap credit.

Another diffy. will be horticulture. They will press for incln. of modern heatg. equipment.

H.M. Cdn’t agree to x/ at present. But wd. have it at suitable date.

Hope we shall stand firm on horticulture. We have made many concessions.
