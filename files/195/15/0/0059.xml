C.M. 101(56). 17th December, 1956.

1. Northern Ireland. [Enter E.H.

Ll.G. When I.R.A. admitted responsibility, we approached Dublin. But since my memo. circulated, Dublin Govt. have made statement &amp; taken action.

H. Now, we can only welcome Dublin action &amp; hope they will give it effect. Draft message to N. Ireland is available. Expresses concern at sitn. but for the rest welcomes Dublin action.

[Enter P.M.G., J.H., Hail.

2. Suez Canal.

S.Ll. Treatment of nationals in E. Fr. have agreed to p’pone U.N. debate for one day. It wd. do no good.

Release of P.O.W. and/or detainees. Shd. they be used as bargaining counter for release of contractors? Geneva Convn. : attitude of Fr. : views of C-in-C. – all run counter, qua p.o.w. But civil detainees are in difft. posn. We mght prepare to remove them – hoping an agreemt. will be reached before final evacuation.

A.H. Politically, diff. for us if we have no card to swop for our contractors’ men. Wd. also keep Eg. offr (brigadier) to swap for Moorhouse.

J.H. Army don’t want to take anyone to Cyprus. But I recognise our oblign. to contractors’ men. Cd. we get statement out of U.N. or Fawzi.

A.L.B. Govr. Cyprus sees gt. diffy. in accommodatg. p.o.w. Gib. cd. take them after 2 wks.’ delay.

If he isn’t asked to take p.o.w., I will press Harding to take civilians.

D.S. Do we not want to re-assert claim to Base – &amp; put civilians back?

S.Ll. Not safe for them to go straight back.

D.S. We must make statement implying tht. we took them out.

J.H. Are sure re brigadier : CIGS believes Lt Moorhouse is dead. How long do you keep brigadier, if you remove him?

Hail. I believe he is dead.

A.H. Final decn. cd. be taken on last day of evacuation.

After discn. : agreed no E. offr. to be held v. Moorhouse.

P.o.w. to be handed over on w’drawal.

Prepare to remove detainees to Cyprus.

221

S.Ll. Clearance of Canal. Read draft of statement for H/C. to-day.

Hail. Doubtful if crews will work these ships w’out better assurance of security. Wheeler’s statements have bn. v. damaging to our morale.

Men I saw on spot were virtually a strike Cttee. – because upset by Wheeler’s attitude, as had also the Germans. They were employed by Admy. to serve under protn. of W. Ensign &amp; said they wd. accept no less. But, with adequate leadership fr. someone sharing their risk, I believed they wd. accept a different arrangemt – until Fawzi’s threat this a.m.

L.P. Wd. prefer to take tougher line in statement. E. has oblign. under Conv. to keep Canal clear : they sank the ships : we are ready to help to clear it – but under condns. we regard as satisfactory.

Hail. German won’t release us fr. our obligns. under charter unless he gets satisf. assurances on security fr. U.N. repves.

A.H. Agree with L.P. Cdn’t we made stronger repns. to U.N.

S.Ll. Strong position to say – we have made these offers, it is not our fault if unacceptable condns. are put upon us.

H.M. U.S. are alive to this now – &amp; ready to bring pressure on U.N. and E. Let some of our unpopularity be diverted to E.

L.P.S. Mght it not be wiser to defer this statement – fr. the angle of holding opinion in Parlt.

S.Ll. But urgently necessary to mobilise world opinion. Also dangerous to allow feeling in H/C. to fester. Prefer to take offensive in H/C. than wait to be on defensive.

P.T. Narrow choice – betwn. to-day &amp; to-morrow only.

H.M. Make it as interim statement – negotns. are procdg.
