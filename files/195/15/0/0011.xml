C.M. 47(56). 5th July, 1956.

1. Overseas Information Services. [Enter E.H.

S.Ll. i) F. Language Broadcasts in Europe.

P.T. Is it wise to drop this – when G may step into vacuum.

D.S. Shd. be weighed with defence expenditure. Mght be wiser to give up some weapon. Saves only £130.000 plus somethg. on overheads.

P.M. Cd. we not consider whole ques as part of P.R. M/E. is more important, in this, than Europe. Standing strat. reserve in U.K. is now 47.000. Shd. we not cut down on assumptn. tht. somethg. will come out of Germany – viz., begin to run down on that assumptn.

Can we take it altogether?

A.L.B. Importce. and urgency of extendg : improving services to M/E.

S.Ll. These particular services are of no gt. importce. Drogheda recommended their discontce. But, qua public, shd. present it as re-deployment.

H.M. We spend £12 m. on this – and £6 M. thro’ B.B.C.

But on tactics wd. delay approach to B.B.C. until we can put whole problem to them. Avoid premature row on minor aspect.

Doubtful about value of sound b’casting. Wd. prefer to put more weight into film &amp; T.V., &amp; getting our material into local b’casting systems. Want to see money put into somethg. whose content we can control.

P.M. Cttee. of officials to consider switch from uncontrolled B.B.C. to controlled propaganda by more modern methods. D. Parker in Chair. Offls. of F.O., Ty., C.O., M/D., B/T.

2. Government Publicity.

A.E. Cd. not C.O.I. direct presentn. of Govt. policy.

cf. I.T.A. recent b’casts.

Discussion on machinery for “propaganda”.

P.M. to consider co-ordinn.

3. Parliament.

R.A.B. Business for next week.

51

D.S. New Towns 9/7. D.S. &amp; Parly. Secy. But spokesman needed for Scotland.

Shall be pressed to refer to future ownership of assets of new towns. Want to say tht. it shd. not be assumed that they will not be passed automatically to l.a.’s. Act provides for sale, tho’ wind-up requires transfer to l.a. Don’t want communities where 90% of houses are l.a. owned. Want some owner-occupiers, and also Housing Assocn. ownership.

S. Rent Restn. Bill. Labour Party have declared intentn. to take over all restricted houses. Is it wise for us to reduce nos. – &amp; incur odium of raising rents. Better to wait until after Election?

H.M. Wd. it have the right effect? If we succeed in raising propn. of rents, the cost of expropriation wd. be that much higher – and likelihood of their being able to do so wd. be less.

D.S. M’while houses deteriorate because owners can’t repair. Diff. to excuse delay. If we go on, pol. issue will be : are Labour ready to put rents down? Cd. they?

H.M. Agree with D.S. on new towns: but is it wise to say it, so far in advance of action.

R.A.B. Cd. give a broad indication of prob. line of policy.

R.A.B. Finish Report Stage of Finance Bill during week: also Third Reading.

12/7. Members’ Salaries. Opposn. will table motion but won’t press it to division. Spokesmen : R.A.B.

4. Police Pay.

Ll.G. Becomg. more awkward in H/C. – P.Q.’s by Govt. supporters. Want to say we are exploring possibilities of legn. to alter posn. in future. New feature of this wd. be reference to legn.

Wdnt. legislate before October – wh. wd. embarrass M/Edn. [Enter H.

5. Israel.

S.Ll. Ben Gurion is spkg. of strengthening his posn. in Jerusalem. Jordan have heard of this. Israel Amb. has bn. warned tht. Anglo-J. Treaty still stands.

W.M. Aircraft to remove Br. personnel fr. Amman &amp; Mafraq have bn put at 72 hrs’ notice.

52

6. Cyprus.

A.L.B. Informed Cab. of proposed statement – as in C.O. Tel. 1209 to Cyprus. No comment yet recd. fr. Govr.

Turks have indicated tht. they wd. accept it, includg 1st. alternative.

S.Ll. Party Mtg y’day was in disturbed mood over this.

E.H. Anxiety in Party will remain, even after this statement, unless i) we can reveal details of our plan or ii) it is clear tht. P.M.’s Norwich speech stands.

7. Ceylon: Defence Installations. (see below.)

7. Federation of Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland.

H. Demand for full membership will be pressed in S. Rhodesia v. strongly.

Malvern’s plan of obtaing. powers &amp; giving them back won’t do.

Search for alternative.

Fedn. can’t qualify for full memb. while so many restraints. But a sufft. area of sovereignty to warrant somethg. like it. N’foundland was recognised as Dom. tho’ we handled her external affairs.

Sectn. 8 of Annex. Alternative (a) is the course I recommend. I will not pursue (b), wh. wd. involve contentious legn.

Remaing. diffy = O.L.’s pledges. If we adhere to these literally, we shall be unable to make any move.

P.M. Danger of S.A. drawg. S. Rhodesia twds. them, if Dom. status for Fedn. is delayed. They will make mischief over this. And at next electn. in Fedn. may be a majority of those who favour closer link with Union.

Hope Cab. will accept this.

A.L.B. Don’t believe there is strong feeling on this in S. Rhodesia. Metcalfe reports in that sense., tho’ he adds tht. it cd. be whipped up in a moment.

If we argue tht. this means little change qua Africans, we can’t give it as much of a benefit to Europeans.

Stress para. 12 of Annex.

Agree to 8(a)(i) – and give him seniority as from now. Also to (iii) and (iv). But (ii) is my difficulty : I can’t agree to that. Where wd. I stand in reln. to P.M.’s of W. &amp; E. Nigeria? They wd. have even wider self-govt. than Fedn. We have refused this status to Malta &amp; Singapore.

H. Malvern has already rejected offer of i) iii) &amp; iv).

53

S. Real diffy. of M. is attack fr. 3 sources a) the 3 Territorial Govts. b) strong Afrikaans element c) senior Col. officials in 2 Colonial territories. Fed-Govt. is not that in full sense : its sphere of power is questioned : Fedn. isn’t working. Malvern alone can make it go : doubt if Wilenski can adopt same detached posn. Even if M. accepted i) iii) iv) now, it wouldn’t last. Will Chandos’ pledge prevent us for ever fr. making any move at all?

A.L.B. It was only because of the pledges tht. Parlt. accepted Fedn.

H. Do we offer now. Or wait until we get a bullying demand.

P.M. Risk tht. they mght. go their own way – cf. American Colonies.

H. Doesn’t really affect Africans at all.

H.M. Give i) – iii) as factual privileges : and add tht. these together are marks of the special posn. of Fedn. w’in the Comm. and its relns. with Comm. colleagues.

[Enter C., N.B.

8. Ceylon : Defence Installations.

H. B. wants to say Ceylon has expd. desire &amp; U.S. Govt. have concurred. C. ready to accept that.

U.K. Govt., recognising right of Ceylon to do so under Def. Agreemt 1947, have expressed agreement…..

Other amendments suggd. &amp; approved.

R.A.B. Politically, this is improvement on earlier drafts.

Agreed. [Exit C. &amp; N.B.

9. New Zealand House.

H.A. N.Z. Govt. have Crown exemptn. from planning control ; but we have some control thro’ bldg. lease.

Holland is v. keen on modern bldg. Architect is willing to make some modificn. Essential, in H.’s view = a high bldg. Much to be said for tower bldg. on this site vice well bldg. We shd. also accept a degree of modernity.

Alternatives a) reject design. Wd. upset N.Z.

….. Not heard …..

[Enter Browne.

10. Capital Punishment.

S. Agreed, in Cab. Cttee., tht. it wd. be better for H/L. to reject on 2nd Rdg. than to murder it in Cttee.

54

Shd. like to stress in debate tht. this issue has not bn. before will of electorate. New convention in H/L. tht. if a Bill has bn. appd. at a Genl. Electn. we pass 2nd. Rdg. &amp; try to improve it. If it has not, we try to delay as long as we can so tht. will of people may become known.

If it were presented to H/L. for second time, we wd. try to give a 2nd Rdg and deal with it in Cttee.

K. Agree.

E.H. Shd. have to consider, after rejn., wtr Govt. facilitates a 2nd. presentation.

S. Att. G.’s suggn. : Govt. shd. then present their own Bill to amend law of murder : and then, if Silverman’s Bill were presented again, Whips cd. properly be used to reject it. We don’t favour this.

Br. Bill as it left H/C. was defective qua Scotland. If it is to pass, it shd. be amended. Genl. agreement.

[Enter R.T.

11. N.H.S. Remuneration of Doctors.

R.T. Diff : &amp; pol. repercussions. Memo. by B.M.A. : 24% increase at cost of £20 M. Shd. like to tell them, next wk., tht. in present econ. sitn. we can’t enter into discn. of this claim.

J.S. wants to add reference to contractual rights. I think that unwise. They wd. ask us to remit it back to Dankwerts. That wd. be mistake.

Rejection on broad grounds wd. give us public support. But not for a legal wrangle.

I.M. Wd. sooner turn it down on merits. If you base it on econ. sitn., they will come forward again as soon as we move e.g. on M.P.’s pay.

Wd. prefer to say “in all circs…”

H.M. Wd. wish to seek compromise betwn. the two. Will discuss with Ministers – before Cab. on Tuesday.

[Exit R.T. 55
