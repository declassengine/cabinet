C.M. 87(56). 22nd November, 1956.

Suez Canal. [Enter E.H., A.N.

A.N. No further news – save newreports of Sec. Genl.’s report, which suggest that it is worse than S.Ll. led us to suppose.

R.A.B. P.M. thinks we shd. stand by position outlined in tels. sent to S.Ll. y’day. Must make statement in H/C. this p.m. – i) U.N. debating &amp; S.Ll. hasn’t yet spoken : can’t v. well anticipate it. ii) rehearse our posn. – no w’drawal until there is effective force by U.N. iii) answers to Sec. Genl.’s 4 ques., bringing in refce. to w’drawal of 1 Battn. as Norwegian Battn. has arrived. iv) condns. of cease-fire – [Arab/Israel peace : clearance of Canal &amp; its future]. Take a clear stand on clearance : we have done our job in Pt. Said &amp; are ready to put our resources at disposal of U.N. : Sec. Genl. on this seems unsatisfactory : refer to Intern. Cl. of Shipping resoln. v) Position in Pt. Said.

Sal. On iv) – are we going to say it’s a condn. of our departure that [ ] be done?

R.A.B. No : can merely say U.N. force isn’t yet ready to take effective action.

D.S. Who judges wtr it’s effective?

RAB. Shall say “U.K. &amp; Fr., with U.N.”

R.A.B. Can’t say to-day we won’t w’draw until Canal is cleared – before S.Ll. has spoken.

Sal. “Competence” – legally competent or physically capable.

I.M. Much turns on sanctions behind U.N. force – will U.N. come in, at full strength, if it is attacked.

D.S. Agree : concentrate on getting assurance tht. U.N. will take

… Further discussion not noted …..

Sal. Comm. consultn. Shd. not someone be put up to say, in debate, the obvious thing tht. if we had had time to consult we shd. have recd. conflictg. views.

H. From consultns. in precedg. 2 months we knew what their reactions wd. be. What shook them was the shock of our action.

Will draw up statement of what cd. be said – &amp; consider wtr it is safe to have it said.

192

A.H. N. Yk. Tel. 1328. Have asked C-in-C. to collect informn. etc., S.Ll. has now said publn. in a week.

S.Ll. suggn. of Solr. Genl. Paymaster Genl.? Or someone outside Govt.?

R.A.B. Speed is most important.

K. In that event don’t trouble to appear impartial. Outside man wd. take longer.

Agreed : W.M. to supervise prepn. of case. Fife Clark to

assist.

A.H. Have now offered to w’draw battn. K. has replied to me tht. complete w’drawal cd. be completed in 14 days. But, once it starts, he will lose capacity for offensive action.
