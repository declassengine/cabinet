C.M. 67(56). 26th September, 1956.

[Enter H.B., E.H., Att.G., Strathc.

1. Bechuanaland Protectorate.

H. Satisf. agreement reached : will be announced to-day. Seretse will be free to return in 2 wks. Hope there will be no trouble in Reserve. Renunciation having bn. made, quick settlement will be best assurance of peaceable receptn.

2. Ministers’ Speeches.

R.A.B. Chairman of Party will m’tain contact with Ministers outside Cab. &amp; Junior Ministers. Wishes a member of Cabinet to do this for Cab. Ministers. I am ready to do this. Will be ready to give such advice as is needed &amp; to arrange necessary publicity.

3. Capital Punishment.

K. Arguments pro &amp; con. are in memo. Bill prepared in readiness : its provisions summd. in paras 2 &amp; 3 of memo.

Suggest we consider merits separately fr. space in P’mme.

Main arguments in favour.

P.M. S.Ll. wd. support Govt. Bill &amp; wd. abstain on Silverman Bill.

I.M. So would I. But some Tory abolitionists wd. be ready to vote against Silverman Bill.

E.H. Of 15 seen, 12 said they wd. support Bill &amp; refrain from supportg abolition amendment. 2 said they wd. expect freedom to abstain on Govt. Bill. 1 is undecided. On Silv. Bill later, they recognised it wd. be foolish to support that when Govt. Bill is thro’.

R.A.B. i) Sorry to add this to P’mme – already full.

ii) No bad faith ought to be alleged if this Bill is introduced. But

iii) If Tories can be told tht. any contrary vote is pure conscience,

others will support us &amp; Bill will be carried. Oppn. etc.,

will be cross : but that can be met by saying we won’t

block or whip on Silverman Bill. We needn’t give it time:

but that will be their only grouse.

Ll.G. Remember that alternative = Silverman : &amp; Govt. are opposed to complete abolition.

H.O. posn. will be increasingly embarrassing. Lucky we have bn. able to reprieve on merits so far. Can’t be sure that will continue.

Must be able to take a line at Party Conference.

130

P.M. Wd. defeat involve resign. of Govt?

L.P. Diff. &amp; rare constitl. posn. Diffce. of view in country &amp; view in H/C. If we don’t act, c.p. will be abolished – &amp; majority opinion is v. that.

Originally doubted Govt. Bill because wd. appear to by-pass H/C. But now it has bn. asked for by middle opinion. We gave free vote so that H/C. cd. give unembarrassed view. But, as opinion is so evenly divided &amp; has bn. so shown, duty of Govt. to produce compromise. That is an honest posn. wh. we cd. call on Tories to support. If we have taken responsibility of producg. compromise, that is a ground for resistg. Silverman Bill: with Whips or, if need be, without.

Ll.G. If Govt. Bill were carried, cd. defeat S. Bill w’out Whips.

P.M. I wd. hope for that.

But cd. we refuse Parly. time for it?

R.A.B. Give him a day for 2nd. Rdg. if he proceeds under 10 min. rule. Time for 2nd. Rdg. of S. Bill fulfils all our pledges. He can’t get either Bill before H/C. before January.

P.M. Party conference. Don’t make announcemt. anticipatg Q. Speech.

A.L.B. In 5 Colonies, law follows U.K. law automatically. But in others legn. wd. be needed. Some wd. not be able to follow lines of this Govt. Bill. E.g. firearms are less common than pangas. Unavoidable therefore tht. local law shd. accord with local circumstances.

E.H. Nine Ministers abstained on Silv. Bill. Can’t hold back-benchers to this plan unless Ministers will do so.

P.M. L.P.S. shd. see Ministers concerned.

Agreed : Proceed with Govt. Bill.

L.P.S. to adjust P’mme accordingly.

[Exit Att.G.

[Enter H.W.

4. Transport Commission : Railways.

K. As in memo.

H.W. Table on p. 31 shows prospective financial position. Based on facts not optimism. Gives Govt. a firm hold over B.T.C. Legn. needed : but wd. be necessary anyway because out-run borrwg. powers. Shd. have to debate plan : mght get 2nd. Rdg. of Bill on same day.

131

H.B. Ty. are impressed by plan. Offers reasonable hope of profit in ‘60’s fr. which repaymt. can be made. Proposals in memo. are Ty. proposals designed to avoid appearance of subsidy.

R.A.B. Ingenious. But paras. 22 onwds. are equivocal &amp; may be ridiculed by Economist.

Content with H.W. suggn. on Parly. procedure.

H.B. Drafting amendmts 22-5.

Approved.

5. Suez Canal.

P.M. i) H.M.’s talk with Dulles – who is willing to stop U.S. dues &amp; to try to influence Panama &amp; Liberia – if U.K. &amp; France confirm that they want it done. He seems to fear E. re-action – tho’ I don’t see why. U.S. flag only 2½% : 11% only if Panama &amp; Liberia included. Propose, from Paris, to ask him to do this. Will satisfy French.

ii) No-one in E. seems to know that N. is getting less than 50% of dues. Can this not be put out thro’ B.B.C.

R.A.B. H.W. speakg. to Shipping Assocn. Friday. Cd. get that plugged.

P.M. Also : pipeline Iraq/Turkey. Survey in progress. Talk about that, not the other thro’ Israel. Stress that this is going fwd.

R.A.B. with F.O. to get publicity for these.

S.Ll. iii) Suggest we don’t oppose inscriptn. of E. item on Agenda. Prefer to oppose it in substance. Agreed.

iv) Terms of resoln. Re-affirm free navign. : call on E. to restore rights of users : endorse decln. of 18 Powers: calls on E. to negotiate &amp; m’while to co-operate with users’ assocn. This is agreed with French : will now communicate to U.S.

v) Skua Conference. I will open. Beeley to carry on – H.W. in reserve if needed. Exec. group : Menzies Cttee. (Norway vice Sweden) plus U.K. &amp; France. Appoint administrator &amp; settle H.Q. Study : addl. members : dues: ……

vi) Pilots (in reply to D.S.) – now in suspense : but must prepare an organn. &amp; hope it will be needed. Pro. tem. E. can handle traffic.

H.W. No. of ships diverted is v. small. We are offering heavy traffic. But some f. ship-owners are diverting. Doing our best to subject N.’s organn. to maximum pressure.

They are recruiting f. pilots – incldg U.S.

132

S.Ll. 2nd. conference got as far as poss. Several countries hadn’t power, &amp; others hadn’t will, to compel ships to go thro’ &amp; pay dues to Skua. Cdn’t get therefore a stiffer formula. Still worth while to get assocn. going, while we go to Sec. Council. If we get no results then we may have to use assocn. as means of forcing issue.

Voting in S. Council : 4 hard : Iran wobbly : Cuba and Peru &amp; China shd be O.K. If so, vote of 9:2. But can’t be sure of keeping that vote on amendments. Will be hard to keep solid front &amp; we shan’t be able to resist pressure for negotn. in some form. What form – we shall now discuss with French.

P.M. Discussions in Paris. Will be difficult. Want to aim at followg:-

a) Statement on Anglo-French relations. Approved.

b) Adhere to negative principle : ensure tht. future system

provides for free navign. : agree tht. we can’t decline all

negotn. &amp; must consider most acceptable form. We don’t exclude force if we fail to get satisf. solution thro’ U.N.

L.P. Stress sanctity of internatl. obligns., &amp; rule of law. It is safer ground to stand on. Not wholly on effective opn. of Canal.

I.M. Wd. be happier if I cd. know more of military plan.

P.M. Gave general outline of mil. plan. [Exit H.W.

6. Reform of House of Lords.

L.P. Alternative proposals thrown out in earlier Cab. discns. have bn. considered – by me &amp; offl. Cttee. – and found unsatisfactory.

Choice for Cab. – no Bill : short Bill : longer Bill. Payment of expenses. At least as urgent as reform. H.M. has put to me a plan by wh. Peers cd. claim £3 relief from tax for each day of attendance in H/L. I wd. accept that plan. Wd. wish this brght in before plan of reform put fwd : but wd. be ready to agree to havg. it put fwd. as part of that plan. But it cd. not be deferred until later.

If we are to go forward, we must decide v. soon. It cd. not be done in this Parlt. unless done next Session.

On choice betwn 2 Bills, I shd. find it v. diff. to commend shorter.

P.M. Cd. be p’poned for one year?

L.P. It cd. still be issue in Election.

P.M. If Election is not until 1959 autumn, time to die down.

R.A.B. Favour going on - &amp; with longer Bill. But a heavy p’mme : c.p., H/L. and Rent. We cd. just manage all 3, if other legn. pruned.

133

D.S. Doubt if public will accept scheme involvg. perm. retentn. of 200 hereditary Peers.

L.P. H/Lds. wdn’t accept eventual eliminn. of hereditary element.

A.L.B. Nor wd. I. Don’t want Monarch to be only survival of heredity.

H. Prefer longer – &amp; sooner the better.

B.H. Support longer – &amp; sooner.

D.E. Disagree. Shorter version – accords with merit, not heredity which is outmoded. Conflict re organn. of society (suffrage, wealth) is largely exhausted. Wd. be renewed by allowg. hereditary element in constn. to strengthen itself. Wd. be unwelcome to many members of our Party.

Support plan for payment. That wd. strengthen H/Lds.

L.P. We are Tory Party &amp; stand for keeping what is good. There is good in hereditary element in H/L.

D.E. As a mystery, it mght persist. If you introduce element of selection, you wd. have to justify it.

I.M. I want to keep her. principle because of Crown. But no genl. recognn. tht. reform is necessary. Short Bill + payment wd. suffice.

B. H. If you leave b’woodsmen, you leave to Labour the excuse for abolishing it.

I.M. This Bill will force Labour into definite policy for abolition.

Agreed : Resume discussion at next mtg.

L.P.S. to consider m’while wtr P’mme cd.stand

3 Bills.
