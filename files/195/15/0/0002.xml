C.M. 38(56). 29th May, 1956.

1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.

R.A.B. Business for next week.

2. Persian Gulf.

S.Ll. Sitn. in Bahrain v. tiresome. We are being blamed for anything which

goes wrong merely because Belgrave, tho’ not our servant,

is a Br. subject. It wd. be better if, as in Kuwait, chief adviser

was not British.

Suggest : B. shd. say he is 62 &amp; must retire before long : adminn. shd.

be overhauled before that happens : promise enquiry (by a B. s.)

into the organisation.

Rulers’ family in B. are indifferent – in Kuwait strong.

Enquiry cd. be done by Cummins (ex Sudan Pol Service) who did

well a corresponding enquiry in Qatar.

[A.L.B. Cummins is a v. good man.] – (mistaken) – because confusion with

Cummin.

P.M. Can’t we recruit more Iraqis for Bahrain Police.

S.Ll. First step on re-organisation wd. be to sell this idea to Belgrave and

get him to sell it to Ruler.

Agreed.

3. Cyprus.

S.Ll. Greek Cypriot priest in London. Runs fund for “victims of national

struggle” in Cyprus. Makariotis: Cypriot, who is Greek by

naturalisation. Camden Town. Lives in house provided by

C/England, who have now advised him to moderate his sermons

etc.,

Ll.G. Wd. be contrary to practice to give reasons for d.o.

Security authies. wd. be glad to see him go.

Been here since ’52.

S.Ll. May be reprisals from Greece.

P.M. Will be assumed tht. he is connected with threats of violence here.

A.L.B. Governor’s visit (2 weeks). Wd. welcome arrangemt. by which one or

two senior Ministers wd. be readily-available for consultn. – as

was done for Singapore Confce.

9

P.M. Policy : we chose between i) constitutional offer ii) co-Domini plan.

We rejected ii) because Turks were not then recognised by

public to have much concern. It is now more widely recognised

that they have. We mght therefore revive that idea – prs. as

well as procdg. with constitutional advance.

A.L.B. Joint memo. of June ’55 – H.M. must – set out this as F.O. plan. Was

not purely temporary expedient.

H.M. May be a better atmosphere for another Tripartite Conference.

P.M. F.O. &amp; C.O. to study this &amp; work out a possible line before Govr.

arrives in Ldn. for consultn.

[Enter Att.G., B-C.

4. Crown Privilege.

K. Para. 8(i) : essential to admin. But Judges aren’t sound on this &amp;

much legal opinion wd. prefer tht. court shd. decide when

disclosure can be made.

Para. 8(ii) shd. go some little way to meet criticism.

Para. 8(iv). These repts. are used for welfare work. But made by

people who are not State servants therefore awkward on that a/c

to claim privilege.

Procedure. I shd. have preferred to make full statement in H/L. But

Simon’s amendmt. on Restrictive Practices Bill comes soon : &amp;

statement ought to be made then or before. Because of rules of

order, may be necessary to have statement by Att.G. before

debate. This may be only way of avoiding defeat on Bill.

Att.G. In Scotland courts have discretion to decide. This will be pressed as

argument in favour of accepting same practice in E &amp; W.

W.O. claim on 8(iv) cdn’t be m’tained. Can’t be said tht. these are

necessary to admin. : only for welfare &amp; morale of Forces which

is not enough.

W.M. V. gt. loss if 8(iv) documents were disclosed. It is in cases where

litigation is not imminent tht. S.S.A.F.A. can do most useful

work.

Judges won’t be got on right lines until K. can make a full speech

on subject.

Att.G. I wd. leave S.S.A.F.A. ques open in my statement.

P.T. One more effort to get Simon not to move his amendment – on basis

tht. K. will make a speech, and opportunity will be found for

general debate, in H/L.

E.H. &amp;

others. Simon can’t be dissuaded.

10

Ll.G. Some exceptional prison medical reports.

K. Para. 22 of Kent’s report covers those cases.

B-C. Will K.’s statement leave open privilege in respect of Social Service

records.

K. I favour standing on old practice – justifiable on grounds of decency.

J.S., B.C., W.M. A.H., Att. Gen to see K.’s statement in draft.

To be made in course of next week (? Thursday).

[Exit Att.G., B-C.

[Enter H.W.

5. Road Traffic : Speed Limit.

H.W. Mtg. y’day with interests concerned. Priv. enterprise want me to do

this in order to affront T. &amp; G.W. Union.

Want therefore to avoid giving firm date – so as to induce Rd. Haulage

Assocn. to go on trying to reach agreement with Union &amp; avoid

another pay claim on this a/c.

Wdn’t fix a date earlier than next spring. This wd. give time for

2 sides to reach agreement.

I.M. Favour this. Think it is still better to give a period, e.g. “the spring of

‘57”.

H.W. Agree.

Approved. [Exit H.W.

6. Parliament for Wales.

Ll.G. Cttee. on administrative devolution is now sitting.

Approved.

7. Kariba Dam.

H.M. Believe we may have lost contracts because our firms unfamiliar with

this class of work. We haven’t done too badly. But we shall be

criticised for putting in money wh. will benefit other countries.

We can say tht. we made our view clear to Fed. Govt. that firm shd.

not get tender merely because of subsidy.

P.T. Fr. &amp; Italian practices are open subsidies.

S. Risky to admit tht. we were negotiatg. on this with Fed. Govt. when

tenders were under considn. No harm in saying we had asked

11

for assurance : awkward to say they had given us an assurance.

Can we not leave out second part?

P.T. I have bn. asked - &amp; shall be pressed to say – what was result of our

repns.

H.M. Fed. Govt. was ready to have us use whatever formula was acceptable

to Bank. The alternative favoured by Bank is easier fr. angle of

S.’s point. Formula : “U.K. Govt. have satisfied themselves by

consultn. with Fed. Govt. that no contract has in fact bn. awarded

which is lower solely by reason of subsidy.”

Agreed: Use “Harcourt” formula, which is acceptable to

Internatl. Bank.
