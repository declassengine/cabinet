C.M. 102(56). 17th December, 1956.

1. Cabinet. [Enter P.M.G., E.H.

P.M. No mtgs. from 21/12 to 3/1. – save for emergency.

2. Cyprus.

A.L.B. Greece : claimed tht. it was not a liberal constitn. because of extent of Govr.’s powers – e.g. his right to decide what was a reserved subject. But in fact they were not concerned with merits. Their re-occupn. was wholly with attitude of Oppn. And, without time-limit for s.d. &amp; promise of release of Makarios, they will evidently receive our statement in hostile fashion. I cdn’t recommend concession on either of those points. Must try to get U.S. pressure to avoid precipitate expressn. of Gk. views : now have W’ton 2488.

Turkey : regard constitl. exercise as academic. But are ready to accept it, so as to appear conciliatory. In statement – as we had accepted s.d., their minds are turning to partition, with Br. enclaves in both zones. They favour early start on workg. out details – even tho’ we envisage it as long-term solution. One modification of statement – on partition, a phrase indicatg. that, if s.d. leads to change in status of island, T. Cypriots wd. be given option of electg. for partition.

L.P. Strategic view : partition not acceptable while we need C. as base. Awkward therefore to risk danger that both sides mght accept partition. Shd. we not make it clear tht. on partition we wd. insist on enclaves.

S.Ll. Better, instead of new sentence – “This may well involve partition of Island.”

A.L.B. V. important to get acquiescence of Turks.

D.S. What interest have we in Cyprus, when we no longer need the Base.

A.L.B. Qua world opinion, we shall put ourselves right : and Gks., if they reject it, will put themselves at gt. disadvantage.

P.M. We shall be asked at once what we intend about the Base?

H.M. “When the internl. &amp; strategic situation permits” will be taken to equal Gk. Kalends. But more realistic assumptn. is tht. a new strategic appreciation may make it practicable to keep a Base in enclaves in partitioned Cyprus.

223

L.P. We shd. also be ready to give other NATO Powers facilities in this base.

A.L.B. Nothing here to prevent that.

P.T. Insert reference to base at x/ in draft para. – “in addn. to the provision of any necessary military facilities.”

H.M. Better – and certainly cheaper – have partition now if we cd. have a base.

D.E. Will anyone work the constitn. when partitn. is foreshadowed as future?

A.L.B. If it worked, Gks. might vote on s.d. for status quo.

H. Preferred original draft. This gives built-in veto to Turks.

A.L.B. It was there by implication before.

L.P. If Base is needed, partition isn’t ideal – for we cd. get same situation as on Canal (hostile population etc.,).

H.M. Need for that type of Base is diminishing. [Exit A.L.B.

D.S. But must own the land of the Base itself.

P.M. For some years to come, we shall need some base in Cyprus to cover Persian Gulf.

I.M. Must go thro’ Radcliffe exercise.

K. This statement satisfies our friends – here &amp; abroad. Also holds out hope of liberal constitn. Puts Gks. in much worse position for attacking us.

L.P. Wd. sooner omit refce. to mil. facilities &amp; be free to argue tht. earlier words = Gk. Kalends.

P.M. Wd. prefer original words, with deletion of last phrase.

L.P. Or “wd. be prepared to accept partition as a possible solution”.

H. Worse, qua Turks.

K. &amp; H.M. Or : “In other words HMG. recognise that the exercise of s.d. in such

x| a mixed community must include partition among the eventual

| options.”

Agreed : as at x/, subject to concurrence of A.L.B.

224

3. Broadcasting : 14-day Rule.

L.P.S. Compromise reached with Oppn. tht. we suspend rule experimentally.

PMG. Approve.

Agreed.

4. Suez Canal.

W.M. Herbert believes no. of killed may be 650, and 800 seriously wounded. Oppn. have informn. fr. U.S. correspondent.

Have told Herbert to prepare report for publn. – confl. covering note and supplementary material for brief. Will prob. be ready to-morrow.
