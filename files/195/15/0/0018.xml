C.M. 54(56). 27th July, 1956.

1. Suez Canal. [Enter E.H.

P.M. On receipt of news, summoned Fr. Amb. &amp; U.S. Chargé d’Affaires. Expld gravity of situation. They undertook to report at once.

Fr. Govt. have now issued statement similar to ours - but adding sentence tht. they will take all steps necessary to protect Fr. lives &amp; interests in E.

Statement in H/C.

S.Ll. First need = common posn. with U.S. &amp; France. Pineau will be here on Mon. (arriving Sunday). Ask Eis. to send someone over at once. i.e. Suggest immediate talks, at high level – where convenient, but Ldn. mght be best.

Our line : we are ready to act – mil., pol. &amp; economic.

Military : good chance to w’draw one divn. fr. Germany. 3 Divns needed to police canal.

Political : note to E. Govt : consider refce. to Sec. Council : consider mtg. of maritime Powers : get U.S. to make plan for oil.

Oil U.K. wd. be O.K. for 3 wks. Shd. need 10 m. tons of from America. Urgent need : to get U.S. planning machinery into opern.

Trade : little effect on our imports : but some on our exports, esp. to India.

Economic : No more U.S. aid is due. £100 M. sterling balances – of wh. £4 M. only is due to go to them this year. cut-off wdn’t hurt them much.

Cotton crop : ⅓rd. to Sov. bloc : v. little to U.K. – tho’ Eur., India/Pak. cd. cut some off.

Stop further supplies of arms. (Agreed.)

Canal Employers (Br.) : we shd. consider this aspect. Law includes penalty for w’holdg. labour. Impt. of B. subjects on this ground wd. give us occasion for action.

P.M. Tabulate things we want U.S. to consider – for my message to Eis. Account of our oil posn.

What circle of Powers do we bring in?

S.Ll. Ship-owning countries (e.g. Norway) : Oil producers (Iraq., Iran).

P.M. Note from U.K., U.S. &amp; Fr. – callg. on E. to allow Co. to resume opns.

H. Dom. H. Commrs. were keen to bring in users of Canal.

K. Basing ourselves on stock-holding wd. be weak ground because Co. is Egyptian. Base ourselves on Convn. – free navign. implies i) managemt. must give confidence ii) reasonable dues. We don’t

85

believe E. can be trusted under either head : as recent facts show. W’out Co. organn., no confidence E. can run Canal.

U.K. not in strong posn. to protest v. natn. with compensn.

P.M. Avoid reference to stopping traffic to Israel because that [Enter A.J.

wd. bring other Arab States on to E.’s side.

S. On ii) Canal is not to be run for own purpose but to finance Dam.

H.M. Much capital needed to deepen &amp; widen Canal. E. has taken over capital liability.

Immedte. ques £102 M. blocked sterling. No new release before Jan. Also they have £14 M. on current a/c. Have told B/E. not to allow any of this to be w’drawn to-day.

Offl. sterling is v. weak to-day.

E. will sell all their free sterling on transferable market if they can.

Shall have to decide wtr we mean to block this £14 M. B/E. wd. not regard E. as reliable holders of sterling – cd. be addl. argument. But mght. provoke them into unilateral action v. us – e.g. closing Canal to Br. shipping.

Canal Co. have sterling &amp; other assets in Ldn. Shall see them &amp; advise them to hold on to it.

Support K.’s view. Argue i) they can’t pay (in what currency?) ii) can’t run Canal iii) can’t develop it. May be a chance to improve what wd. be posn. in 1968.

L.P. Discover what balances E. holds in U.S. or France.

P.M. Action of E. is not unlawful – but in breach of Convention.

P.T. Dislike unilateral action re £14 M. – mght. damage chance of getting other Powers into line.

L.P. Possible sanction : oil supply line fr. Suez to Cairo.

S.Ll. Can’t bring enough pressure by economic pressures. Must face poss. of ultimate military action.

H. Dom. Hgh Commrs. anxious to bring in Sec. Council. Initiative by us.

L.P. Wd. bring in R. and veto.

P.T. E. wd. have good answer to us : no reason to believe trade wd. suffer etc.,

H.M. Our genl. line : Canal = internatl. asset. Importce. enhanced [Enter D.S.

by oil – W. Europe. Can’t be nationalised. Must be regarded as internatl. trust. Warn them we won’t have it monkeyed with by E. This implies, in last resort, use of force.

86

S.Ll. Shd. we renounce ’54 Agreement. They have violated it …..

P.M. Message from Paris. This may make it easier for us to take action on £14 M.

[Enter C.O.S.

P.M. Told C.O.S. econ. action alone wd. not be effective.

Any mil. action wd., we hope, be joint – with U.S. &amp; Fr.

But what cd. we do – alone, if required.

Cd. we cut oil to Cairo, by occupying Suez?

C.N.S. Br. cruiser at Alexandria.

C.N.S. R.N. wd. have to operate Canal &amp; support land &amp; air forces.

Shd. want to give impressive show of overwhelming force. Keep cruiser in Red Sea. Move up off Suez. Tho’ a bit vulnerable to air attack. Agreed : let her go to Aden.

CIGS. Eg. 3 Inf. Divns. + 1 armd. About ¾ opposite Jews in Sinai. 500/600 tanks. 600/800 technicians (Poles &amp; Czechs)

In U.K. cd. send 1 complete Divn. : 1 complete Brigade : Parach. Brig. in Cyprus cd. be brght to readiness : collect another Inf. Brig.

We cd. therefore get 3 Divns. + 1 fr. Germany.

Cd. complete fighting with 1 Divn. Wd. need 2 to clear up in E.

Limiting factors wd. be : requisitiong. shipping &amp; directg. labour. Wd. take some weeks to complete adminve. plan : for opposed landing at Port Said.

10th. Armd. Divn. in Libya – a large armd. brig. group. We cd. also use some fr. Cyprus : but must assume EOKA wd. step up.

Want to be directed to make plan v. worst case.

C.N.S. Unknown quantity = wtr f. technicians wd. help E. troops.

CIGS. Libya : limit 25,000. But wd. have to declare re-inforcemts. sent.

C.A.S. Durg. build-up of land forces, we cd. build up bombers ringing Egypt – from various bases. We cd. attack E fr. U.K. with med. bombers. El-Adem too near. Wd. move fighters to Cyprus.

Get bombers in posn. When Army is ready to move, we cd. say publicly tht. if landing is resisted we wd. use our air power.

C.N.S. Rescue of Br. community in Egypt?

L.P. Our objective wd. be to unseat Nasser, not to guard Canal. Wd. be better (?) to strangle E. rather than launch mil. opn. wh. wd. unite them behind Nasser.

P.M. Pay tribute to Services for their readiness.

If we have to back diplomacy by mil. action, are we ready to go on – even alone. I believe Fr. wd. be with us : &amp; as on prev. occasions U.S. wd. follow our lead if we took it.

88

L.P. Yes : failure to act here wd. pave way for greater disaster later.

H.M. V. grave decn. But essential to our future. Can’t settle this on narrow fin., or techn. grds. Whatever it may cost, we have no alternative. Agreed.

Agreed : Estimate by Tuesday.

Finance.

H.M. £7 M. with ordinary commercial Banks. Order wd. be needed.

£7 M with B/E. who won’t delay delivery for more than few hours.

B/France will follow us in tough line.

Politically (U.K.) wd. be good to do it. Risk : unilateral retaliation v. us. Difficult balance. Don’t want to provoke them until we are ready.

Basis of action : in view of “natn.” until posn. is clarified.

Agreed : block this if Fr. will do the same. (at least B/E.)
