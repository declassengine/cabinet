C.M. 60 (56) 21st August, 1956

[Enter C., E.H., - Menzies

1. Suez Canal.

S.Ll. Decln. tabled. Pak. will move some amendmts. wh. are acceptable to U.S. and us. If these accepted, Pak., Iran and Turkey will adhere: and we shall have 16.

Method of presentation to Egypt. ‘Asians’ prefer a Cttee. to present as basis for negotiation. We wd. prefer presentn. askg. for acceptance : but this is unlikely to meet with sufft. support in conference. Hope ques of presentn. will be discussed separately &amp; subsequently fr. decln.

If they adhere to this plan, the decln. shd. be adopted by Wed. at latest. by 16 countries. Some others may adhere, subject to reservations.

Presentation. Genl. support for view that there shd. be a Cttee. incldg U.S. Venue wd. be for Cttee.

P.M. Better if Cttee. cd. send document &amp; offer to meet if needed for elucidation. Don’t want them to go to Cairo.

Germans, Fr., Norwegians all expressed to me the hope tht. Menzies as well as Dulles wd. be members of Cttee. – plus Scandinavian and possibly Persia. Their support for this method was condl. on its being done by Cttee. incldg. U.S. &amp; Austr. Hope we can avoid long negotiation.

M. My Parlt. meets on Thurs. of next week for Budget. But if Austr. Govt. asked by U.K. to allow me to do this, and agreed I wd. be willing to go.

P.M. Saw Menon this a.m. Made it clear tht. our posn. was adherence to decln. Asked him to refer to Delhi a request for India’s support for decln. – even subject to reservation.

S.Ll. Bagdad 914. V. encouraging.

P.M. What about Parlt?

R.A.B. If summoned for Tuesday, will tend to reveal cleavage of opinion. Wd. like to keep ques open until Thursday. That wd. leave time to get them back on Tuesday.

L.P. Agree. H’to had favoured early mtg. But, Labour likely to make diff. speeches, that might prejudice Nasser’s reply – and weaken world opinion.

P.M. See force of that. But later mtg. will be awkward fr. enforcemt. angle.

Agreed : Review this at mtg. of Cab. Thursday.

103

R.A.B. Do we know what Dulles’ attitude wd. be in next stage – enforcement.

S.Ll. If he has thght ahead, he has revealed nothg. of his attitude.

H. He is so closely identified with firmness that he can’t drop it suddenly. Prs. hasn’t thght.

P.M. Sure he has thought : but he says nothing. Regret his unwillingness to agree now to a financial sanction on dues.

H.M. Dues paid in Paris are available to Co. Those paid in Ldn. are not – for W’minster Bank are unwilling to pay. They ask me for indemnity. If I give it, I have to inform Parlt. This wd. imply tht. I had doubts about validity of Co.’s position. Co. may now sue U.S. shipping co. for dues. Am trying to hold this position – w’out legal action.

S.Ll. Norwegian ship wh. switched paymt. fr. Cairo to Ldn. has now been allowed to pass thro’ Canal. Significant.

H.A. Russian tactics?

S.Ll. V. quiet.

P.M. Have told R. that decln. is minimum demand – can’t compromise on it. He gives me impressn. tht. R. don’t want to get mixed up in this. May be tht. U.S. &amp; R. are both safer on the side-lines.

2. Export of Arms : Turkey.

C. T. want a large no. We cd. supply. Spain &amp; Peru also in market, &amp; prob. able to give higher price. We doubt T.’s ability to pay : &amp; fear private firms mght not take a T. order.

H.M. Don’t believe T. cd. pay. £2M. down and total of £10-12 M. They can’t even find the £2Mm. It wd. in any even mean delay in settling their commercial debts to us.

Contractors cdn’t get E.C. cover. Heavy expend’re on refit (£6 M) before we cd. give the ships.

S.Ll. T. have asked us not to tell U.S. No hope fr. that source.

W.M. x/ Want to help. Cd. we forward loan of 3 frigates: mght cost £1M.

P.T. Wd. prefer gift – for sake of commercial debts.

C. Can’t give to Turks, when we made Pak. pay.

C. x/ Loan of serviceable ships, under N.A.T.O. plan.

104

H.M. Preferable.

F.O. and Admiralty to concert reply on lines of x/.

3. R. Navy : Time-Expired Regulars.

C. As in memo. Is it politically acceptable to make use of powers under 1950 Proclamation.

P.M. Terms of Proclamation wd. be v. alarming. Another for Marines.

K. We have told Parlt. this covered R.N. We cd. reasonably use 1950 Proclamation.

W.M. I recommend that course.

R.A.B. Cd. inform Parlt.

P.M. Not unless asked.

[Exit C.

4. Cyprus : Surrender Terms.

A.L.B. Tel. 1676. Govr. doubts if there will be much response, but thinks it wise to make some such move at this time. I wd. at same time say something about Radcliffe’s work on constitution – promised acceleration with a view to visit to Cyprus in next few weeks.

S.Ll. Why not give them option to go to any country.

A.L.B. We want to make it clear tht. many of these terrorists are Greeks.

Agreed: K., L.P.S., Ll.G., A.L.B. &amp; F.O. repve. &amp; S. Genl. to consider this p.m. in detail. 2.30 p.m. in H/L. &amp; report to P.M.

[Exit S.Ll.

5.

Bamangwato Reserve.

H. Both v. restive. Both have now renounced claims to Chieftainship – on behalf of selves &amp; children (Seretse) Negotns. with them may leak to Press. Offers a chance to get S. &amp; T. back w’out difficulty.
