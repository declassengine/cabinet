C.M. 42 (56) 14th June, 1956

1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.

R.A.B. Business for next week.

21/6. Debate on Techn. Education. D.E. and R.A.B. with Sc. Under Secy. if required.

2. Capital Punishment.

S. Considerg. p’mme in H/L. Unlikely we can take it before 10 or 12/7. : nearing end of session. May not complete before recess. Wd. create bad impn. if H/L. left it unfinished. Cd. shorten time betwn. 2nd. Rdg. &amp; Cttee. if Oppn. are content. Shall approach them, if Cab. agree. Agreed.

Shall need small group of Ministers – L.P.S., Ll.G., S. &amp; K. – to concert a Govt. line on amendments. + Ch. Whips (2).

3. Parliament : Procedure.

R.A.B. Scope can be restricted if we add : Priv. Members’ &amp; Fin. Resolution. Otherwise may be pressure for a wider enquiry. Hope Ty. will agree that this shd. be covered.

H.M. Fin. Resolns. If drawn tightly, avoids some amendments. So, if practice is relaxed, procedgs on Bills will be lengthened. Willing to have it discussed however. May find some compromise.

Def. debates : moving Spkr. out of Chair. At mtg. with Fnce Cttee. y’day, Govt. supporters were evidently seekg. opportunity for annual discn. on capital exp’re. Our procedure gives too much prominence to defence votes because dates fr. age when this was main item of exp’re.

P.M. We cd. negotiate on this in light of Cttee’s. findings.

Will not include the point about P.C.’s Questions.

4. Industrial Disputes : Steel Industry.

I.M. March : advance of 11/= accepted by prodn. side of steel industry but rejected by m’tenance men who imposed ban on overtime. Employers have offered arbitn. includg. retrospection on award. No request made to me to intervene. Wd. be mistake to intervene for employers’ case is v. strong &amp; shd. not be undermined.

But ban on overtime is resultg in fall of output.

P.M. 6% drop in May : will be higher in June. Must affect our economy. Can’t afford to increase imports. Serious situation.

28

Another inter-union dispute. Cammell Laird’s has also broken out again. Shd. Govt. express disapproval?

S. Don’t speak unless we can act.

P.M. Shd. we make it clear tht. T.U.’s are wreckg. the economy.

H.A. Public think we cd act, but fear to do so.

H.M. Cd. M/L. call the 2 sides together, or even separately, with a view to making it clear where blame lies.

D.S. Consider again means of curbing restrictive practices.

I.M. Only think likely to emerge fr. our consn. of this will be a code of conduct. But wdn’t affect this – ban on overtime is being used as means of enforcing wage demand. They want to preserve differential.

D.S. We need a sanction v. men who decline arbitn.

H.A. There may be criticism tht. we aren’t governing.

D.E. Yes : a note of exasperation.

P.T. Limit to our powers is a natural limit. Can’t require men to work.

But intervention by M/L. wd. at least give publicity. That in itself may be valuable.

W.M. Publicity is prob. best weapon.

Agreed: M/L. to consider intervention for that limited purpose.

[Exit E.H.

5. Central African Federation.

H. Malvern believes tht. w’out some concession his Govt. wd. be defeated at next election &amp; succeeded by another even less friendly to Africans.

His dodge is to move twds. full membership by some assurance to U.K. re N. territories.

Doubt if Fedn. cd., on that, be accepted as sovereign independent state or full C. member.

Can’t give reality because of African opposn. Conclude therefore tht. we can offer only the trappings as in App. This won’t satisfy him. He will say Fedn. experiment will be wrecked.

We can review in 1960 : and say tht. m’while we will help to move African opinion in this dirn.

29

A.L.B. Agree. This is only answer we can give. Won’t satisfy Malvern. He may try to get us to hold up G. Coast m’while.

H. The row wh. breach of pledge wd. cause wd. in fact set back the prospects of Fedn.

S. White popn. of Fedn. has doubled in 10 years. This reply will be taken as insult. If we can’t offer more, wd. it not be better to advise M. to press his request after G. Coast has achieved Dom. status. P. opinion here wd. take it better then.

Is there precedent under N. America Act for requiring endorsement by Parlt. here of legn. in Fedn. affectg. Africans?

H. Consistent with Dom. status?

S. Believe it contd. in Canada after Dom. status obtained.

A.L.B. Trouble is : Africans wd. know Can. provn. was a dead letter.

P.M. Make it clear that M. can’t have what he seeks. See wtr he wd. prefer Appendix or, as S. suggests, nothing. Don’t give App. now as a firm answer.

P.T. Cd. S. Rhodesia alone be independent C. member? Wd. that exclude Fedn.?

P.M. Consider that too. [Enter B.C.

[Exit S.

[Re-enter E.H.

6. Trinidad Oil Company.

H.M. Shall make statement in H/C. to-day.

EEB &amp; TLR saw Vos y’day : put condns. as provisional on Govt. decision. It is clear that Texas Co. wd. accept the “Trinidad” conditions. Wanted to know wtr they wd. accept a) and b). Vos thought there wd. be no difficulty about either.

Will lay White Paper (Friday) on details. Shall say this to-day. May help to avoid having immediate adjournment moved.

P.M. Unfortunate tht. Texas is part of Aramco, which [Enter J.S.

is doing us so much harm in S. Arabia.

S.Ll. Warn our supporters tht. too much row over Trinidad cd. boomerang on our oil interests in M/E. Awkward if M/E. countries took line which our ‘Imperialists’ want to take over Trinidad.

7. Government Expenditure : Economies.

H.M. Embarked on this with Cab. support. So far, not v. satisfactory. Best I can do is to announce £79 M. as provisional first instalment.

30

W.O. told me last p.m. that their contn. wd. be less by £7 M. than had bn. offered. They over-estimated the effect in this year of cuts of £13½ M. Figure for Defence will therefore be £27 M.

We cd. take a chance on short falls (prodn.). But wd. sooner not take into a/c, unless cancellations. Wd. destroy validity of my original statement. Also wd. make it more diff. to handle Suppl. Estimates points.

W.M. Distressed at £7 M. But we might find £30 M. And I think we shall in the end achieve £34 M.

H.M. Let us get it to the highest point which we can honourably reach.

R.A.B. Proportion – even on memo – is unbalanced. Shd. be more on defence.

H.M. On second instalment, I hope to be able to get in some early results of big defence changes – or at least forecast the large economies which will result in future years.

P.M. Can’t spend £180 M. on bombers. We are planning to make, not 200, but well over 300.

W.M. Have asked C.O.S. to consider reducg. front-line strength.

D.S. Dpts. generally shd. be asked to plan ahead to cut exp’re in future years. We are asked always for economies in current year &amp; can’t do v. much because so much is already committed. This shd. apply to civil Dpts. as well as defence.

P.M. Proposed N.A.T.O. initiative. Hope we can move U.S. &amp; Canada. Tho’ Steele is pessimistic.

[Re-enter S.

R.A.B. V. much disappointed at low figure for defence.

D.S. Will be much criticism at failure to reach £100 M.

P.M. Not if represented as first instalment.

H.M. In second instalment we cd. bring in second ½d. on milk and somethg. on housing subsidies.

P.T. Strategic stocks. This is questionable accounting. Doubt if this can be represented as genuine savings. It is taking credit for sales already made &amp; put it towards servicing of stocks we continue to hold.

Ready to discuss with Ty.

P.M. Defence. May get something on Valiants and on R.N. oil.

31

Ll.G. Home Defence. We set £73 M. for ths year cpd. with £70 M. (?) Reduced successively to £45 M. Now to £25 M. This is 60% cut. This is a volunteer service – dependent on co-opn, of l.a.’s. The £1½ M. on production relates to contracts already let therefore may involve compensation paymts.

J.S. If risk of war is written as low as this, we may be unable to keep C. Defence going. May need to present this as a standing-down of C.D.

W.M. All of addl. £11½ M. save the £1½ M. relates to stocks. £70 M. of food stocks now : to improve balance etc., we wd. have to go to £120 M. But on strategic outlook as now, we cd. afford to make redn. of £6 M. At reduced level we shd. have supplies for 3/4 wks plus 3 wks in pipeline.

H.M. Redns. in stocks won’t affect structure of C. Defence services.

H.A. Accept £6 M. qua food-stocks. Don’t stress no. of weeks because un-balanced and ill-distributed. Cd. make up lee-way v. quickly if strategic situation changed again.

Ll.G. The £1½ M. is under review.

Civil Expenditure.

S.Ll. F.O. Exp’re. Wd. prefer Jordan loan (¾ M.) to be p’poned until 2nd. instalment. Don’t want it specified as Jordan in July statement. Consider wtr it need be disclosed in Estimate.

Involves increase in ppt. fees to 30/=.

R.A.B. Will O-in-C. be subject to Prayer?

I.M. M/L. – 2.000 out of staff of 22.000. Six times the propn. imposed on M/P. – a comparable Dpt. Will be apparent tht we offer less service at a time when unemplt. has at last begun to show itself.

B.C. Ass. Bd. 350 staff. Diffy. with staff, who will protest.

In my Dpt., mainly on war pensions side.

I.M. In small town, offices for M/L. M/P. and Ass. Bd. In longer term, we cd. economise by amalgamation.

C.O. Expenditure.

A.L.B. Non possumus statement – at length.

Can’t defend any reduction in C. D. &amp; W. – only a p’ponement.

H.M. Kenya. Cd. surrender £1½ M.
