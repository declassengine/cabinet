1. Queen’s Speeches: Prorogation. [Enter A.N., E.H.

Points in discussion.

Para. 9 : C.R.O. point.

Para. 3. ? omit final phrase because effect on U.S. election. Refer

to P.M.

Paras 6 and 7 : reverse order.

Para. 13. Ll.G. Cd. we say we “continue to foster C.D. Services.”

Agreed : add phrase recognising their voluntary effort.

Para. 10. Delete “unhappy”.

Approved subject to drafting amendments to be submitted.

2. Capital Punishment.

a) Voting by Members of Govt.

R.A.B. Raised ques on lines of my brief. P.M. thinks Ministers shd. support a Govt. Bill &amp; not therefore be free to abstain on a Silverman amendment.

E.H. Back-bench abolitionists will be influenced by conduct of Ministers.

H.A. Had assumed we shd. be free to abstain. But I see that if amendmt. were carried we shd. be in diffy. I wd. prob. feel that, if I supported Bill, I must resist a wrecking amendment.

I.M. I wd. hope tht. those with v. strong feelings, as I have, I shd. be allowed to abstain. Believe most Ministers wd. be able to vote against on H.A.’s argument. If there are only a few of us in that position, it might be O.K.

B.H. If it’s known that any Ministers are to abstain, rot will set in.

A.N. Wrecking amendment – logical to vote against it.

I.M. Wd. like time to consider position.

b) Silverman Bill.

R.A.B. i) If the abolitionists moved reasoned amendmt. to Govt Bill and lost it, they wd. be precluded from going on with their Bill.

ii) They might be in same position if amendmt. to Cl. 7 were lost.

141

H.M. If ii) were correct, and we warned them, a) might never arise.

R.A.B. Must get considered opinion fr. Clerk to H/C., before we finally decide a) or wtr Bill is introduced.

[Enter Hail., A.J.

3. Legislative Programme.

R.A.B. Malta. A.L.B. Agreed to omit, subject to re-instatement in emergency.

Hail. Naval Discipline. Cttee. has finished its work. Draft Bill, with only one controversial Clause. H/C. will be restive if no mention in Queen’s Speech on grd. tht. Admy. are being obstructive, even now Joint Cttee. have done the work. Wd. be 12 mos. anyway before it came into effect.

R.A.B. May have to exclude fr. Speech on grd. tht. report hasn’t yet bn. presented to Parlt.

J.S. Support that – if report not yet seen.

Hail. Believe it will have bn. presented before Speech is made.

R.A.B. Ch. Whip to ascertain facts re date of presentn. of report.

Electricity Bill.

A.J. Urgent need to press on with n. power p’mme – even more because Suez. For this, reform of structure of industry is necessary.

L.P. Agree in principle. But I consistently rejected, in my legn., attempts to get on A. E. Bd. repn. on special interests e.g. electricity.

A.J. Mining Subsidence. Wd. prefer to include in Speech, and accept crowding out because lack of time.

El. industry can’t see any way of improving posn. w’out legn.

H.M. Ty. wish to discuss terms of Bill to ensure proper financial structure.

A.J. Pressure to disclose intentns. re Herbert report. Uncertainty in industry.

D.S. Wd. a firm statement of policy meet that.

D.E. If need for reconstrn. is made out, legn. is urgent.

J.S. Cdn’t we get on with what can be done w’out legn.

A.J. But central proposal is establmt. of generating authy.

142

R.A.B. Shall be in diffies. over Sel. Cttee. if we have taken no action for 10 mos. on Herbert Rpt.

H.M. A good bet politically because electricity &amp; atom are forward-looking.

Film Bill.

P.T. Unless I can go on with this, no money will be f’coming for the industry.

House of Lords Reform.

L.P. Fr. discn. on 26/9 there emerged serious doubts on diff. grds by

D.E. : doubt perpetn. of hereditary principle.

I.M. : too dangerous.

W.M. : better to do life Peers only.

Have since discussed with senior colleagues – main diffy. seems to be selection by H/L. predominantly Tory. Suggd. tht. selection Cttee. shd. consist of equal nos. of 3 Parties + cross-bencher. Charm of original plan for H/L. was tht. Selection Cttee. and its selection were non-Party. Ready to discuss this with Peers. But, if they agree with me, Cab. will have to choose wtr to go on or not: long Bill, short Bill or none.

Don’t think much in I.M.’s point. Labour Party will one day wish to abolish H/L. &amp; it will be more diff. for them if H/L. have m’while been made more effective.

D.S. I am not opposed to hereditary principle. But prefer to leave it unchanged &amp; put fwd. only shorter Bill.

I.M. That is a view which I cd. support. It is longer Bill wh. would force Labour Party to harden into policy of abolition.

H.A. I am now of that opinion.

K. Support long Bill. Admit short Bill wd. prevent H/L. dying on its feet. But want an effective 2nd. Chamber. Labour rules out anythg. wh. wd. compete with H/C. Forced therefore to build on existg H/L. At present only 400 take oath. Why not improve on present posn.

Not much politics in this now. But, even if Labour didn’t co-operate at first, they wd. come in – &amp; anyway we wd. have effective H/L.

Wd. Labour Govt. abolish H/L.? Our m/govt. wdn’t work w’out 2nd. Chamber. We shd. make a good one. Reputn. of Govts enhanced by grasping nettles.

A.L.B. Favour longer Bill. Must get rid of backwoodsman charge.

J.S. Agree. Labour didn’t abolish H/L. in ’45. Endorse A.L.B. point : that is dangerous weakness.

143

B.H. Agree. Short Bill fails to deal with most dangerous weakness. And this may be last chance to do anything effective.

No harm – only good – in inducing Labour Party to define their policy.

R.A.B. X Legn. next session wd. be too late.

S. alone cd. get this thro’.

Hope he will investigate composn. of selection Cttee.

L.P. On x/ : if left another year, mght well become Election issue.

E.H. Back-bench opinion : some think it shdn’t be touched : some that powers shd. be tackled.

Hail. Now or never. And unless S. will introduce &amp; back a plan, no legn. will be practicable.

Cd. suggest to S. a short Bill which wd. preserve heredy. princ.

H.M. Wd. not wish to overthrow H/L. But dangers in touchg. it. It will gradually evolve. Purpose of short Bill is to allow life Peerages to swamp rest, if that is general will.

Practical problem: how to make it work? Life Peers plus allowances. How do you select those whom you will pay. Pay those who happen to come. Or pay those selected to sit.

My worry over selection is system of doing it. Self-selection. If we can’t make that more easily defensible, we may have to confine ourselves to short Bill + allowances.

L.P. But main charge v. H/L. is tht. v. large nos. can come &amp; vote when they will. If you pay those who come only once a year abuse will seem greater. Or if masses attend, to be paid.

V. diff. for Govt. to defend short Bill as reform of H/Lds.

H.M. But if we present this as real reform can you justify not dealing with Bishops etc.,

Hope L.P. will consider suggn. re method of selection. All-Party Cttee.

D.E. It is the method of selection wh. worries me most. The “one-nation group” is against touching this.

Agreed : L.P. to make soundings re composn. of Selection

Cttee.

Rent Restriction.

R.A.B. Major &amp; controversial measure.

M/H. wants to add immedte. de-control of ¾ m. houses.

D.S. Power to lower ceiling. Not a good plan to rely on this only because some time before we have more informn. on wh. to do so. Hence,

144

to show teeth, prefer as well to de-control a slice immediately. Must be substantial to create consumer-resistance to high rents. Considering ¾ m. or ½ m. Pre-war move was 600.000. Cttee. want to consider amount.

R.A.B. Wd. add to Bill.

H.M. Support new proposal.

J.S. Earlier de-control was based on Interdpl. Cttee’s findings. Wd. need to consider Scottish position. Ridley Cttee. stipulated no decontrol unless shortage of accommn. had bn. overcome. I cdn’t say that of Glasgow : doubt if D.S. cd. say it of some towns in E. &amp; W. Can’t drive people out of houses by rent increase if alternative accommn. is not available.

D.S. Bill may have to be confined to E &amp; W. J.S. is reserving his posn. on v. many points as well as this.

K. On Leasehold : our remedy was to give Rent Act tenancy. Hope that won’t be prejudiced.

D.S. Special Clause in Bill to deal with this.

Agreed : 1) add an element of immediate de-control subject

to J.S. reservation of Sc. position.

2) D.S. to agree with H.M. What he says on this

subject at Party Conference.

Conclusion.

R.A.B. Most of my candidates for exclusion look like coming in.

We may therefore have to drop one major Bill.

Otherwise shall have short recesses + spill-over. Party won’t like that. y/ Must therefore drop a big measure or 3 small ones.

I.M. Shops (Closing Hours) mght be kept for later session – popular.

R.A.B. P.M. gave a near assurance to T.U.C. Criticism by L.C.J. &amp; L.C.C. on unsatisf. state of law. Cheapest of Gowers Bills.

E.H. Also cd. be taken in Cttee.

4. Queen’s Speeches : Opening.

R.A.B. Read this draft with y/ in mind.

Believe myself we shall have to omit one major Bill.

J.S. Omit paras. 4 and 6. Anglo-U.S. relns. are not happy at present.

145

L.P. They remain “of first importance”.

J.S. Then omit last phrase.

A.L.B. Para. 7. Why “free institutions”.

L.P. Better than “constitutional advance”.

A.L.B. Prefer to omit last phrase.

A.L.B. Paras 9 &amp; 10 can be omitted. 9 is premature. 10 may be avoided.

RAB Para 14: to be considered in reln. to presentn. of report.

H.M. Para 17. Some further reference to Plan G. may be needed.

R.A.B. Can’t 20 be omitted?

P.T. On pledge of this legn., financial commitments are being accepted. If omitted, doubts are bound to arise. with authy. I have said we will do this.

H.A. Para 21. Omit last sentence. May be able to substitute a sentence on eggs.

H.M. Para. 23. Rlways, unlike roads, are not Govt. responsibility. Wd. prefer to omit last sentence. Agreed.

R.A.B. Para. 24 may stand – pending final decn. on p’mme.

D.S. Para. 26. If legn. is to be confined to shops etc., I will produce a difft. draft. If genl. legn. is contemplated, this reference to shops is out of balance.

R.A.B. Prepare draft on assumptn. tht. there won’t be time for large legn.

Para. 28. Inclined to think this shd. be limited to E. &amp; W. J.S. Wd. welcome Cab. Cttee. under K. on this ques.

Agreed K : D.S., J.S. &amp; Fin. Secy.
