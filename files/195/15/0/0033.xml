C.M. 70(56). 9th October, 1956.

1. Agricultural Policy. [Enter E.H., A.N.

Special Review.

H.A. N.F.U.’s warned they must not expect to be recouped for wage increase. 6/= awarded to E &amp; W : none so far in Scotl. or N.I.

They have asked for special review. Full year wd. be £10 M: this period wd. be £5-5½ M. We have twice held sp. review for figure of this order – and often have rejected. It is small relatively to farmers’ incomes. Recommend we refuse sp. review.

But, if we do, we shd. put beef prices into defensible posn.

J.S. If we held sp. review, there wd. be immedte. renewal of wage claim in Sc. I support H.A. Agreed.

Beef Prices.

H.A. Last spring i) owg. to imports of chilled, prices dropped : we shall under-recoup farmers by £13 M. This will cause charges of bad faith. They will get this amount in the end : we shd. give them as much as we can in current year. If we don’t they will press, at annual review, for increases generally – &amp; we shd. pay twice over. I am £5 M. or so in hand : but shall need a Supplementary.

Suggest recoupment of betwn. £11 and 12 M.

H.M. Last year they were over-paid, but didn’t offer it back.

H.A. Largest part of overpaymt. came fr. market, not Govt. Ours was guaranteed minimum : we told them tht., if they cd. get more from market, they could. We shdn’t therefore expect to get it back.

H.M. System isn’t working as an average over years.

R.A.B. Agree : will have to be adjusted : farmers don’t understand it.

Approved – subject to amendment of statement.

D.E. When can the tariff be announced? Wdn’t that help?

H.A. P.M. was anxious tht. it shd. be delayed.

P.T. Anyhow it’s part of Austr. talks – can’t be brght out in isolation.

[Exit E.H. 147

2. Unemployment Benefit.

I.M. This is abuse of Fund. Has some effect in limiting mobility. Para 6 proposal wd. stop it – by making a man lose 2 days of his normal working week before he qualifies for benefit.

Politics of it are difficult. Will be regarded as blow v. motor industry &amp; others now in diffy. It has bn going on in Lancs. for some time w’out comment – short-time in cotton being common. We shd. have trouble with T.U.’s.

Prs. we shd. accept in principle &amp; put in draft Bill, but defer final decision to January. Wd. transform Bill into v. controversial measure. This is course favoured by P.M. – judging in Jan. acc. to temperature of relns. with Unions etc.,

B.C. Accept that course.

H.M. So do I.

R.A.B. Suits me. May not be room in P’mme for such a controversial Bill.

B.C. Our supporters wd. like it, and may press for it.

[Exit B.C.

[Enter A.J.

3. Open-Cast Coal Mining.

H.M. Proposals for better compensation justified because relatively much greater value (economic) of getting coal.

Outstanding ques : shd. they be retrospective. Wiser not –

R.A.B. Cd. go back to May 10.

H.M. Yes : but no further back.

H.A. See genl. objns. to retrospectn. But whole object here is to win goodwill. : wd. do it, if it was our thing to make everyone happy. Ready, however, to start with payment fr. date of announcement.

A.J. No logical date to wh. to go back. Prefer to start fr. date of announcement.

Agreed : paymt. fr. date of announcement.

[Exit A.J.

4. Somaliland &amp; Horn of Africa.

A.L.B. Must get agreed policy – if only because Somalia ceases to be trust territory in 1960.

Sitn. has got worse since memo. for Ethiopians have refused to honour agreements. Disorders prevented only by efforts of Drysdale.

Suggest we remit this to Cttee. of officials to sort out differences.

148

F.O., C.O., M/D., Ty. under Cab. Office Chairmanship.

Agreed.

[Re-enter E.H.

5. H/Commons : Redistribution of Seats.

Ll.G. Cl. Davies’ point can be met.

Labour Party suggns. are unacceptable. Suggest J.S. and I be authorised to continue negotiations.

Motor-cars at Elections. May we discuss this with Labour too?

R.A.B. Shd. Ch. Whip be associated with talks?

Ll.G. Yes.

H.M. x/ Don’t go too fast. Don’t want this Bill until near Election.

I.M. On point re Speaker : these have bn. v. controversial matters as between Parties : unfortunate that Speaker was drawn into the quarrels : he himself wd. prob. prefer to be out of it.

Ll.G. Have persuaded him to continue. But something in I.M.’s point.

R.A.B. y/ I will ascertain Spkr’s present attitude before talks begin. And see, in particular, what he thinks of suggn. in para. 8.

Memo. approved, subject to x/ and y/.

6. Suez Canal.

A.N. All save U.S. &amp; Yugoslavia have spoken in S. Council. Indicns. that D. will come out strongly in support.

Others are not v. much in line – esp. Iran.

Much pressure in coulisses for mediation etc., – as expected. Menon, who has bn. to Cairo &amp; Ldn, is now on way to N. York. Plan now on paper – internatl. co-opn. rather than management : no sanctions save provn. for arbitration. Provides for Israeli shipping – reference to Int. Court on interpretn. of new convention. Plan discussed in Cairo, wh. is instructg Fawzi in N. York. But can’t at this point regard it as more than Indian plan &amp; not v. good fr. our angle.

Skua – established, with Executive. Italians have bn. diff. So have U.S. – to prevent their sliding out, we propose U.S. shd. move proposal tht. dues be paid to Skua – we wd. then support it.

149

7. Cyprus.

A.N. J. Holmes has bn. to Athens – to explore possibility of compromise. Has now returned with written statement of Gk. P.M. –

a) Ready to agree tht. after 3 yrs. it shd. be decided when to

apply principle of s.d. – by 3/5th vote of NATO or by

direct consultn. with Cypriots. Holmes think they wd

extend to 5 yrs.

b) Liberal constitn. with P.R.

c) Makarios must be consulted – tho’ they don’t ask for his

release, and if we cd. get a) &amp; b) Gk. P.M. mght go

ahead w’out M.

L.P. Wd. be great mistake to accept any date for s.d.

8. Jordan.

A.N. Iraq intent to put troops into J. Assurances now recd. thro’ U.S. that Israel wd. regard small movements with calm.

Iraq C.G.S. is not now prepd. to do more than send advance parties to Mafraq. Because of distrust of Nuwar. And may back out altogether.

9. Suez Canal (contd.).

L.P. Struck by “co-opn.”. in Fawzi’s speech. For this was keynote of Menon statement to me. Looks as tho’ M.’s plan is Egyptian. Also arbitration may turn out to be E. preference – they don’t like Court or U.N. Can’t regard M.’s plan as “impartial”.
