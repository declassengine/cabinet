C.M. 83(56). 13th November, 1956.

1. Commercial Policy. [Enter E.H.

R.A.B. Earliest day for debate in H/C. – 26/11.

H.M. Time is ripe to decide. But decn. is merely to start negotns. on these lines. Further consultns. with Cab., industry &amp; Comm. Govts as negotns. proceed. They will last for a year at least. Treaty for ratification unlikely to mature in less than 18 mos.

Decn. now : go to Europe with nothing to say or take initiative in putting fwd. proposals for discn.

Negotn. will take 18 mos : action 10 yrs.

Can’t put it fwd. unless reasonably sure it cd. become national policy (bi-partisan). Must therefore have debate in H/C. – either with resoln. : or go fwd. on basis of Govt. decn. taken merely “in the light of the debate”.

RAB. Need : authority to negotiate, both from Cab. &amp; fr. Parlt.

H.M. If we don’t take initiative – plans may break down. This mght. be serious blow to Eur. unity. Better to have negotns. brkg. down after 12 mos. or so ; for unity wd. be preserved m’while. Unwise for us to precipitate breakdown. The other danger : plans may take form unacceptable to us.

Views of Doms. Canadian reply more favourable than I feared. Australia : new agreement marks a desire by Austr. to support our initiative. N.Z. will follow. S. Afr. is not interested. Asiatics are interested only qua developmt. of Eur. as source of capital investment in Asia.

Reactions in U.K. Cautious. F.B.I. survey : in terms of no. of workers employed 85% in favour : evidently appeals to big firms. T.U.C. international &amp; liberal tradns. favour it.

Opinion in Europe : in Fr. &amp; Germ. there are signs of movement away fr. Customs Union twds free trade area for the whole. Our interest prob. lies in preferring Customs Union for the 6 Powers. We must stand on posn. tht. our plan assumes the C. Union. If that assumptn. falls, a new situation. Tactics : put our plan in quickly. This wd. strengthen our bargaining posn.

H. Comm. attitude twds. negotn. is favourable. Their anxiety is, not for themselves, but for our b/p. Their attitude wd. change if we abandoned our excln. of food-stuffs. Reaction : more favourable than I expected.

P.T. Clear tht. we shd. go into negotn. Reaction better than I thght. F.B.I. wd. be surprised if we did not go fwd. to negotiate. In Party a much better receptn. than I thght.

In debate, may get higher degree of national unity than I thght.

178

I.M. T.U.C. response is v. imaginative, for a protectionist body. Attitude is encouraging.

R. Recent events have made it even more important tht. we shd. act promptly on these lines qua strengthening Eur. unity.

Humphrey : most important move since Marshall Plan : best hope for Eur. prosperity : promise of firm U.S. support. (Tel. from Harcourt 12/xi).

H.M. M/E. situation. No tariff action for at least 3 yrs. Short-term effect only on confidence – &amp; that may be good. By time it begins to take effect, we shd. have overcome our diffies. arising fr. Suez or succumbed to them.

R.A.B. Mention in Q. Speech – diff. not to go on.

Impact on Party – no reason to delay. In H/C. favourable.

Won’t emerge fr. negotns. in same form as put in. May be inroad on excln. of food which may require review.

Will lead to v. stern internal measures. Don’t underestimate that. Severe effects on cotton &amp; cars, in 5 years’ time.

Sal. Feared tht. this wd. weaken Imperial link. But that doesn’t now look so v. strong. And as more Colonies become independent, &amp; as we are excluded fr. U.S. market, we must turn a little twds. Europe. My mind has therefore changed.

Impressed by Humphrey – more than by Eis., who was always sentimental over united Eur. But wd. wish to know offl. U.S. response before we took final plunge. Don’t want to do anything more to estrange U.S.

Cdn’t go fwd. w’out assurance of bi-partisan approach. Too big for a purely Party plan.

R. U.S. final view not known. St. Dpt. have referred it to Cttee., under Clarence Randall, on For. Econ. Relns.

H.A. Support.

D.E. Support all the more because of Suez. Favourable opportunity – more constructive line for Europe. And more necessary.

Level of techn. educn. will become even more important, if we are to be competitive. Wd. like to link my p’mme with this.

K. Mentioned earlier some centres of unpopularity. Results of examn. of these are more favourable than I feared.

Favour getting resoln. fr. Parlt. authorising us to negotiate.

R.A.B. Suggest H.M. &amp; P.T. frame a motion for discn. with P.M.

179

P.T. There are dangers in that – e.g. series of amendments on wage equalisation, standardisn. of social services etc.,

Wd. think it safer for Govt. to decide “in light of debate” – w’out vote or amendment.

H.M. Favour latter course – followed by Govt. announcement.

B.H. So do I. Opposn. prob. won’t want a vote.

D.S. Pleased at degree of support wh. has bn. won for this policy. Try now to get it adopted as national policy – even at cost of longer discussion.

Risk of assurances v. protected trade area in Eur. – in order to satisfy U.S. and Canada. If we give this away, we shall have achieved nothing. Eur. does need continuing protection v. N. America.

R.A.B. Don’t underestimate i) shift of opinion in Eur.

ii) stiff eventual effect on our industry.

But, subject to that, go ahead as proposed.

Agreed.

2. Parliament.

R.A.B. Business for next week.

21 &amp; 22/xi. Rent Restriction : Powell – Stuart – Sandys.

[Exit H.M.

3. H/Commons Disqualification Bill. [Enter B.C., Hail., Att.G.

Att.G. i) Reverse disqualification. We prefer to follow traditional system. Alternative wd. not allow H/C. to retain control.

R.A.B. H/C. wd. not agree to transfer its control to Courts – Agreed.

Att.G. ii) List vice definition. Parlt. wants latter. Must, however, rest with Govt. to amend list : and arguable that this gives undue power of patronage. Agreed.

iii) Repeal of existg. disqualifn. qua contract &amp; amend rules of H/C.

Agreed.

iv) Cl. 1(4). Repeals reverse disqualifn. in existg. statutes. Para. 8. of Ll.G.’s memo: I dissent, for reasons in para. 4 of mine. Sel. Cttee. were considerg. fitness for election : Minister wd. be considerg. fitness for a particular office. End of para. 4 – practice of M/Pensions : I now understand applied in one case only &amp; now discontinued.

180

R.A.B. Active participn. in politics (wtr in Parlt. or not) is considn. which excludes not mere membership of Parlt. Approved.

Att.G. Paras 10-11. Support – save for amendment to correct mistakes.

Agreed.

P.T. Contractors. Have we dropped original proposal?

Att.G. Yes. Now limited, at Sel. Cttee. recommn., to disclosure of interest.

B.C. Cl. 1(4). As it stands, wd. be diff. for me to enforce removal of tribunal members when they become candidates or are elected. Must keep tribunals out of politics. Add to Sched., or include proviso to Cl. 1(4).

Att.G. My clear view is tht. M/P. can do what he wants under Cl. 1(4) as it stands.

B.C. But is it clear, politically, tht. my action is not contrary to spirit.

* If Cl. 1(4) stands, wd. wish that made clear on 2nd. Reading. *

Ll.G. Ready to accept Att. Genl.’s view on Cl. 1(4).

Agreed : Cl. 1(4) to stand, subject to * * above.

Early intron. desirable. There will be criticism.

E.H. How do we do last sentence of para 7? Another Sel. Cttee.?

Ll.G. Hope not. Wd. consult Speaker. Discns. between Parties, perhaps.

B.C. Sel. Cttee. didn’t consult my Dpt. I have amendmts. on 4th. Sched. May I put my suggns. to Ll.G.

Ll.G. Yes : tho’ wd. prefer amendments to be moved after introdn.

[Exit Att.G., B.C.

4. Nuclear Radiation.

Ll.G. V. important to get this out quickly, for training.

Nothing to upset anyone.

R.A.B. What about the map?

Ll.G. Has all bn. made public in Press.

J.S. Want it issued. But shd. consider timing.

A.H. Earlier publications haven’t attracted much attentn.

181

I.M. V. much against publn. i) P. 2. (c). Shows how little we are doing. ii) Timing : in reln. to recent R. notes etc.,

R.A.B. Discn. needed with M.R.C., and local C.D. authorities. Shd. we publish before that. Prefer to use it, for discn.,, without putting it on sale.

D.S. Policy shd. be to play this down. The more publicity, the more criticism that nothing effective is being done. Oppose publn.

Sal. M.R.C. are expert on this. See x/ on pp. 1 and 2. Will look as tho’ we are in such a hurry that we can’t even wait for that consultn.

Ll.G. Ready to p’pone publn. until that consultn. completed.

R.A.B. You cd. also communicate it to l.a.’s for private consultn.

Agreed : Use this, w’out publication, for consultn. with M.R.C.

and l.a.’s. Don’t mind risk of leakages.

L.P. Also suppress map. Agreed.

5. Suez Canal.

R.A.B. Much turns now on Hammerskold’s mission to N. Unwise therefore to say anything v. much in debate to-day.

Truce Observn. Offrs. are going from Haifa to Pt. Said.

A.H. Some have arrived.

A.H. First contingent of Force are ready to fly in to Cairo.

D.S. We shd. have as much say as E. on functions of Force.

R.A.B. Diffies. raised by N. are influencing H. more in our favour.

A.H. No evce. of substantial supply of R. aircraft to E. Some high-flying activity over Syria &amp; (less) Egypt. Airfields are, however, being repaired. Chief R. infiltration is into Syria : &amp; not v. rapid there qua aircraft. Rumours exaggerating R. help are being put out fr. Syria. War of nerves.

Sal. E. condns. i) troops on armistice line (ii) E. to decide when Force w’draws. Hope S. Genl. won’t accept that w’out consultn. with us. 100 miles from Canal.

x| Wd. wish to express to S.Ll. our apprehensions on these points.

Fear increasg. power of S.G., U.N. Must get machinery to control him.

R.A.B. Also use of Br. gear in clearing Canal.

182

Hail. Expd. situation in Pt. Said. Plenty to do there. But even more important to get down to Timsa.

We have only organn. wh. can do this. Only thing U.N. have done is to delay Dutch &amp; Danes from going on with work they had contracted to do for us.

Agreed : F.O. to telegraph to S.Ll. on x/.

A.H. Unresolved ques : what sanction behind U.N. Force if E. attacks it.

Sal. Sanction is that it represents U.N.

D.S. Important, however, to define its functions.

[Re-enter H.M.

6. Exports of Arms : Turkey.

H.M. Strong arguments against. Indian re-actions. Loan will annoy all clients to whom we sell.

H. We have made Pakistan (also member of B. Pact) buy &amp; pay for re-fit.

Hail. We need Battle class – &amp; cdn’t give them.

Para 7 of S.Ll. memo : 2nd. alternative isn’t practicable.

1st. alternative 7(i) : we cdn’t do it on Navy Votes or Admy. d’yards. Believe it wd. cost near £4 M. than £3 M.

H. Extended credit?

P.T. She can’t pay – until long after the ships are worn out. Credit wd. only damage our other creditors. We shd. therefore give or lend.

Hail. Re-fit is the expensive element : and has to be paid for, to private d’yards.

H.M. Financial arguments are all against. But we ought to help them, as our friends. Yet, if we do, what answer have we to Pakistan?

If we re-fit in private yards, we can’t give credit – for P.T. reasons.

Problem : how to do this w’out offence to Pakistan. Study method of “loan” which wd. avoid that : on assumptn. that we shall never be paid.

P.T. Try it out on basis of “lending” the ships.

H.M. I will w’draw financial objn. if means can be found of doing it w’out offence to Pakistan.

Agreed : C.R.O. Admy. – in consultn. B/T. and Ty to seek such

a solution, for approval of L.P.S. and P.M.

183

F.O. to consider quid pro quo on staging facilities for

civil aircraft.

[Exit Hail.

7. Agricultural Policy.

H.A. Gave views on each of 3 ques.

H.M. On 97½% we may well be arguing on unrealities – for costs are now unlikely to fall. Shan’t be committing any real money.

Given a package – written assurance on sp. review : firm stand on 33⅓% for cap. grant (with nil. for horticultural wh. wdn’t qualify qua agriculture) : then concede 97½%. Agreed.
