C.M. 68(56). 3rd October, 1956.

[Enter E.H., P.M.G., A.N.

1. Opening of Parliament: Television.

P.M. I and L.P. agree this is undesirable. B.B.C. want it.

R.A.B. Increasg. separation of Parlt. from people.

L.P. Wd. have to omit the Speech, because appearance of bringing Sovereign into politics. But w’out it, the rest isn’t worth it.

B.H. Technical diffies. also in Chamber.

PMG. I.T.A. &amp; newsreels wd. have to come in.

Agreed : Reject. [Exit P.M.G.

2. Cyprus.

A.L.B. i) Recrudescence of terrorism. V. bad effect of p. opinion in Cyprus. Suggn. tht. Marine Commandos are on 24 hrs’ notice. Proby. not true : even if it were, see no reason why it shd. explain deterioratn. in p. opinion. Can’t really explain it.

ii) Radcliffe – left twds end/Sept. (25/ix.) and is still there. His proposals are shaping in dirn. unacceptable to Turks – unicameral system with Gk. elected majority. Island is too small for bi-cameral. Safeguards for T. minority are prs. adequate while B. sovereignty remains : and his scheme applies only for that period.

Govr. wants re-statement tht. no constitn. will be introduced while terrorism continues – or condns. for free elections don’t exist. He also wants us to ensure T. co-opn. in constitl. reform. Also a positive statement on s.d. Tel. 1992: Anglo-T. Treaty.

P.M. All this, under (ii), shd. be considered by C.P. Cttee.

A.L.B. iii) U.N. Procedure.

W.M. Sure it won’t prejudice our genl. posn on “internal adminn”.

A.N. Yes : quite sure.

C.P.(56) 226 approved.

[Enter B.C.

135

3. War Pensions.

B.C. Follows earlier Cab. discn. Considn. of ageing pensioners led to concln. tht. best method was allowance for worst cases. Other proposal is for unemployable category of younger pensioners.

These 2 classes are most deserving on merits. Also attract most public support. Concessions here wd. make it easier to hold general front.

H.M. Wd. wish to discuss with B.C. a 2/3 year view on pensioners generally (incldg. o.a.p.). Don’t want to deal with these ques piecemeal.

P.M. V. well. But it will be hard to wait on all this.

Agreed : H.M. to meet with B.C. &amp; I.M. as proposed

(H.B. intervening) and to report before Parlt. re-

assembles.

[Exit B.C.

4. East-West Trade : China.

P.T. Bldg up quite a reasonable little trade with Ch. in tractors &amp; land-rovers. But not v. large.

A.N. But there has bn. quite a landslide since our announcemt. in July of more use of exceptions procedure : increase of £2 M.

U.S. have given indicn. tht. they will agree to more liberal procedures later in year. Hope therefore tht. m’while we can avoid provokg. them.

P.T. We can, by adminve. means, delay things under after Election.

P.M. Don’t damage our trade. U.S. promise is no more than was given to me, months since.

A.L.B. “Pie in the sky” again. I can’t ask Malaya etc., to back-pedal.

P.T. Limit it to adminve. action in U.K.

A.N. U.S. have a good case on “peeled off” items.

P.T. No : they protested v. our sendg. 30 tractors – wh. cd. have bn. supplied by R.

H.M. Strong advice : pay no attention to U.S. on this. Election will be fought on domestic issue, mainly agriculture.

P.M. Say we have no intention of doing more than now before end/year.

Agreed.

136

5. Tariff Policy: Meat. [Exit E.H.

H.A. Now Argentine trade has retd. to priv. enterprise, prospect of increasg. supplies fr. there. Pre-war experience suggests tht. A. will sell, whatever price : this suggests meat prices will fall over coming years.

A &amp; N.Z. are concerned at this prospect. Diff. therefore for us to hold free import posn. (save 4% on real). GATT prevents use of quotas. Propose therefore to use tariffs, as we did on bacon. Doubt if 10% will do : shall need to go to 15%. Even that won’t keep A. beef out – for they will reduce their prices to get into market. In 2 yrs. therefore we mght have to resort to quotas.

Negotiators (officials) wd. wish not to have discretion to go above 10%.

P.M. Affects genl. policy – c/living as well as comm. policy. Why not quotas.

H.M. First, GATT. Thereafter, need to revert to State trading to manage quotas.

Tariff of 10% wd. ultimately increase c/living by 0.6 points. Unless A. reduced price in order to get in competitively. But wd. help to meet current Austr. diffies. – &amp; psychologically wd. impress U.K. farmers.

I.M. Scarcely one basic cost in index wh. hasn’t risen this year as result of Govt. action. But, on balance, think we must negotiate as proposed.

H.A. On bacon, we don’t expect price increase despite tariff.

H.M. Wd. propose to do this, if authorised, as part of deal with Australia.

P.T. Stress fact tht. this is designed to preserve Comm. advantages under Ottawa Agreemts. [There was then a quota.]

H. Wd. save much money under Austr. Meat agreemt., wh. is v. expensive for us.

R.A.B. Bad timing – soon after increase in bread.

P.T. But inevitable – Austr. talks can’t be p’poned.

Agreed : negotiate with liberty to Ministers to go to 15%

after officials have tried for 10%.

137

6. Australia : Trade Talks.

P.T. Millers have bn. helpful.

P.M. Para 6(c) will dismay U.K. farmers, whom we have bn. urging to grow wheat.

H.A. Tho’ we have reduced price at last review in order to encourage switch to other grains.

H.A. Alarmed at compounders’ idea. Will annoy Canada: &amp; doubt if we can defend it.

P.T. Don’t rule it out. Wheat is key to these talks (not meat). But believe we shall have to go over 850.000 t. in order to get retentn. of 10% on our manufactures. Think we may have to go to 1m. Urge therefore tht. compounders’ scheme be worked out in readiness –Ministers can decide later wtr we shd. do it, despite diffies., to get agreement.

R.A.B. Hope no legn. will be needed – on compounders’ scheme.

H.M. Wd. like to enquire into that. Wasn’t aware of it.

Memo. approved : Compounders’ scheme to be worked out

&amp; Ministers to be told, esp. wtr legn. is needed.

7. Christmas Island.

A.L.B. No strategic or econ. importce. to us. No ties with us. Adminn. by Singapore is a matter of convenience only.

If Singapore Ministers object or ask for compensn. from us, we cd. re-consider.

If Cab. agree in principle to transfer, I can consider means.

Popn. 2.000, of whom 80% are Chinese. Main livelihood is from phosphate factory, wh. is Australian.

D.S. Don’t see why anyone shd. pay compensation.

H.M. Singapore gets royalties fr. Austr. company - £130.000 p.a. They will demand compensn. for that.

H. Austr. cd. agree to pay that so long as phosphates are worked less the cost of admin.

H.M. Agree : Singapore shd. not have it. And shd. enjoy royalties net of cost of admin. while phosphates are being worked.

138

8. Morocco.

A.N. We surrendered these rights in Fr. Morocco. Can’t keep them here, now M. is independent.

[Re-enter E.H.

9. Meeting of International Bank. &amp; Fund.

H.M. Reputn. created there by R.A.B.

Suez has bn. continuing strain on our reserves. Conclude, however, tht. we must stand it out – for it reflects only ‘confidence’ not unsound basic condn. of our economy.

Fund. Cd. provide $500 m. in such circs. – of which $350 m. wd. be our own contribn. On this a/c I thght it right not to resist small Egyptian w’drawal.

Bank. Has lost no money. We have made more out of it in contracts than we have contributed to it. This has done us better so far than alternative of tied loans – tho’ I am now considerg. latter. Bank has now decided to finance private, as well as Govt., projects.

Also decided that only members shd. be able to contract (?). This was opposed by Jordan and, disgracefully, Canada abstained.

[Enter K.

10. Commercial Policy.

H.M. Explained course of consultns. with Comm. Finance Ministers in Washington.

P.M. Wd. wish it to be explained now a) consultn. was authd. by Cab? b) it was consultn. on a project not a decision c) views of C. Govts are not yet known.

R.A.B. Concerned tht. Party Confce. shd. seem to have bn. misled if facts affectg. U.K. are not disclosed now.

H.M. Read extracts from statement to be made at Press Conference.

R.A.B. If asked at Conference, I shall say no Cab. decision has bn. taken on this.”

H.M. I shall say to-day : “Govt. have not yet arrived at a concln. on this vital matter” “We can’t until all these discns. are completed, at home &amp; abroad – with Comm. &amp; with Europe.”

P.M. We authd. H.M. &amp; P.T. to take soundings so that we mght be in a posn. to take decisions.

[Exit RAB., A.N.

139

11. Suez Canal.

P.M. Paris discns. went well in end, but after gt. diffies. on first day.

Because Fr. believe this situation is a threat to whole life of Europe, not merely oil or Algeria. They think tht., if N. succeeds, other Arab rulers will fall – and R. will move in. This wd. mean tht. Europe wd. be at mercy of R.

Fr. are v. anti-American in this : they have written them off. U.S. statements are such as likely to encourage R. to move in, believing there is no real danger. They may at any moment offer guarantee to E. I wd. still favour action, but it wd. then be much more dangerous – and much more frightening to public in U.K.

Indian initiatives. Nehru has now admitted that Menon got nothg out of N.

If N. continues obdurate, it will be easier for us to move quickly. If they offer any negotn., diffies. &amp; delays.

Mollet has again raised common citizenship &amp; offered in that event to enter Comm. Shows their mood.

Effect of D.’s speech in France will be v. bad. May be hard to hold them. They are likely to blame us.

Users’ club has made moderately good start.

We face a v. diff. 2 wks. – not made easier by D. or H.G. But no alternative but to play U.N. hand through.

H. Unless we can get negotn. on acceptable basis, we must go thro’ with force.

But not sure Menon’s scheme plus sanctions wdn’t meet our needs.

D.S. Wdn’t do if Nasser remained.

P.M. N. may even bring about coup before Suez settlement – e.g. in Saudi Arabia. May be revoln. at any moment there or in Libya. And everything U.S. say makes that more likely.

H.M. U.S. Govt. put v. high the diffy. we shd. have, because divided opinion, in launchg. mil. opns.

I.M. Cumulative effect on labour of T.U.C., Lab. Party Confce. etc., wd. be to cause serious industrial trouble here, in key places, if we launched a mil. operation.

P.M. I wonder. Our candidate at Chester-le-Street said tht. miners there were in support of our policy on Suez. Same re-action from Edelman.

I.M. Wdn’t prevent docks &amp; rlway leaders from bringing men out.
