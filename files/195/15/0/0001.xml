C.M. 37(56). 17th May, 1956.

1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.

R.A.B. Business for week after Recess.

Tuesday: complete Cttee. Stage of Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill.

Wed./Fri : Report &amp; 3rd. Rdg. of Road Traffic Bill.

2. Remuneration of Members.

R.A.B. Opposition re-action is uncertain – tho’ threatening a little. On the

whole they are unlikely to be v. obstructive. Pressure remains for

action on Junior Ministers’ salaries. Shall have to act when

economic sitn. is more favourable. Feeling about Peers’

allowances is sympathetic.

3. Parliament : Select Cttee. on Procedure.

R.A.B. Shd. avoid frequent enquiries, but some points are urgent viz.,

i) quorum for Standg. Cttees. ii) composn. of Sc. Grand Cttee.

iii) Supply Ballot. iv) Private Members’ Bills which wd.

involve expend’re.

These are worth enquiry. But will 1922 Cttee. press for wider enquiry.

Suggest I explore chances of being able to confine it to the

points specified above.

J.S. If we can’t have a Cttee., we shall have to adjust (ii) without one.

Wd. there be any harm in wide t. of r. – there aren’t many serious

issues likely to be raised?

B-H. Yes : some dangerous ideas.

H.M. If we open (iv) there will be pressure to widen Fin. Resolutions.

Can this be averted by narrow t. of r? We have something to lose

here, as well as gain.

R.A.B. Propose to see first wtr 1922 Executive wd. accept narrow enquiry.

Fin. Secy. cd. be associated with these soundings. Agreed.

A possibility is to do i) and ii) only this Session &amp; leave the rest over

till next Session.

Consult 1922 Executive &amp; report back.

4. Reform of House of Lords.

L.P. Diffies. of hereditary Peers. One such, when I said “you can’t possibly

put fwd. that scheme : you might as well say you believed in

divine right of Kings” replied: “But I do believe in divine right

2

of Kings”!

Selection Cttee. : wd. begin by asking all wtr they wished to be

considered : I believe 50% wd. decline : choice wd. then be made

between remaining 50%. Process of selection, by all-Party Cttee.,

would give us cream of the House. Revision for each Parliament

wd. keep it fresh &amp; up to date.

Urgency : figures of attendance show clearly how small a propn. of

hereditary Peers take part. “Majority of backwoodsmen are

now in City of London.”

This method wd. select those who can &amp; will serve, &amp; wd. enhance

reputn. of H/Lords.

Wish for authority now to ascertain informally wtr back-benchers in

H/L. wd. support this scheme.

Swamping. Am more doubtful now wtr this shd. be excluded. For wd.

be important not to combine this measure with any change in

powers of H/L.

Peers who decline to sit in H/L. Shd. they be eligible to sit in H/C. My

view : they shd., but shd. not then be eligible for H/L. later.

K. Strong support for this plan. Slow decay.

P.M. Agree. Single-chamber govt. wd. be disastrous.

Believe country wd. accept this. A monumental achievement for

this Parliament. Next session wd. be last chance.

Shd. K. &amp; S. consult with R.A.B. &amp; E.H. on outstanding points : with

Cttee. of officials under Coldstream to help. Settle some of these

before takg. soundings of back-bench Peers.

D.S. Will be said tht. this is designed to secure permanent Tory majority

in H/L. because Selection Cttee. has Tory majority &amp; won’t be

trusted to give adequate repn. to other Parties.

Life peers. Reflect division of Parties on first choice only – or

thereafter also. I wd. prefer tht. after first batch P.M. of the day

shd. be expected to nominate life Peers of his own Party.

L.P. Wd. prefer to keep to proportionate basis until whole 200 had bn.

appointed. Thereafter P.M.’s unlimited choice.

D.S. Result wd. be 200 reflectg. state of Parties; but other 200 wd. ensure

Tory majority.

L.P. Inevitable.

P.M. Diff. to find 200 life Peers?

L.P. Yes : that’s why we start with 75.

R.A.B. Shall wish to discuss some of details in App. of C.P. 119.

Compn. of Cttee. of Selection – acc. to strength of Parties in H/L. or in

the country. That is a crucial issue. If the former, it strengthens

3

criticism tht. this wd. give permanent Tory majority.

D.S. Two kinds of Lords will not ultimately be satisfactory.

A progressive method wd. be better. E.g. Peers not automatically

qualified to sit : Peer cd. renounce hereditary element. That wd.

give gradually a better balanced system as between Parties.

K. 100 years since Wensleydale decision. Creation of life Peers thus

prevented. A gt. tragedy. Merit of L.P.’s memo : reverses that

decision : restricts sitting of the 800 odd. Also consistent with

1910 decision – as in App.

Essential to have a simple scheme.

S. Disadvantage of Sc. system – too public. Means that some are elected

who shdn’t be.

Continuing appointments. Hope P.M.’s will select from other Party.

Urgent need now is creation of more Labour Peers.

I.M. Danger of linking compn. of H/L. with voting for H/C. (Party

strengths) using effect of vote for one purpose to do an entirely

diffnt. constitl. purpose.

L.P. Not wedded to this criterion. But who can think of a better. It is after

all only an initial necessity.

K. Cd. limit it to that. Thereafter leave P.M. of the day unfettered.

L.P. Suggn. of repudiation of hereditary element. i) offensive to Crown.

ii) doubtful if Peer has right to disinherit his son.

P.M. Bound to be diff. to start this system.

H.M. This won’t be done without a big political row.

Diff. now to defend hereditary right to govern.

Labour Party will prob. boycott it.

Details can be discussed later. Gt. issue is wtr we are ready to defend,

in 2nd. half of 20th. Century, hereditary right to govern; and

justify a House with perm. Tory majority.

L.P. I’m not keen to defend hereditary system. But an elected H/L. wd.

be even more unacceptable to H/C.

Choice therefore i) let it die ii) do something like this or iii) go at once

to single-chamber govt.

D.S. Issue is not betwn. hereditary &amp; elected House. Nominated is real

solution nowadays.

P.M. S.B. said “Don’t touch H/L.” But now, if you don’t, it will die.

And we can’t have single-chamber Govt.

4

R.A.B. May need 10 days Parly. time in H/C.

H.M. Healthier for them to talk about this than about these dreary economic

subjects like liquidity ratio.

H.A. Support this because I regard it as first step towards abolition of

hereditary principle.

I.M. Can’t make any scheme work without Labour Party co-opn.

Wd it be worth consultg. Attlee?

H.M. Prs. as time goes on people will prefer to accept life Peerages.

P.M. That is an answer to criticism of this scheme. It will make it possible

to evolve towards disappearance of hereditary Peers.

Agreed : Ministers (as above) to consider details.

Report again.

[Exit E.H.

5. Disarmament.

S.Ll. Must have policy – before mtg. of Commn.

Choice : adhere to Anglo-Fr. plan. But U.S. won’t put any figures in

so it remains too theoretical. This won’t do.

Therefore I think we must take a fresh initiative. Limits on men and

on materials – must try to work out plan with Allies. Diffy. =

nuclear. Risk of 3rd. countries. On this therefore we must

include somethg – e.g. as in para 3 of Annex III, wh. wd. protect

our own nuclear p’mme.

W.M. Para. 14. x/ worries me. Our contn. to nuclear is a vital natl. interest.

We can’t get our deterrent (effective no. of megaton weapons)

for several years. Anxiety about 3rd. countries shdn’t be allowed

to thwart our own p’mme. Anything on nuclear must i) protect

our own p’mme thro’ time-table ii) provide for adequate control.

L.P. Fear being commd. too soon to limitn. or prohibitn. of nuclear – for we

wd. then be exposed to R. man-power superiority.

P.M. Don’t believe R. are at all disposed to abandon nuclear. They are

proud of their achievement.

S.Ll. Firm line on control will prob. ensure pace of agreement on nuclear

doesn’t go too fast.

P.M. Can’t hope to find a moment for prohibn. which will suit all countries –

it is like musical chairs.

S.Ll. Seek only authority to explore with Allies possibility of 5

a new initative.

P.M. Shd. A.N. go round to capitals concerned. Won’t be able to do it by

notes. S.Ll. shd. consider. Wd. appear to keep U.K. initiative.

6. Volta River Project.

P.T. For informn. mainly.

Aluminium cos., luckily, made the running in exposing diffies.

We made it clear we cd. accept only a limited liability : &amp; suggd.

outside finance.

Gold Coast repves were v. sensible. They have approached Bank, who

will now investigate. In 6-12 months’ time Bank may come back

&amp; we may have to consider wtr we shd. invest in this.

H.M. Our contn. wd. be about £50M. Good to have p’poned for 12 months.

P.M. Cos. may hesitate until they see how G. Coast will do after

independence.

A.L.B. Lee’s handling of this was “beyond praise”. Hope B/T. will continue

to take lead on this.

7. Kariba Dam.

H.M. Am as upset as P.T. at result. But alarmed at suggn. x/ in para. 3 of

B/T. memo.) i) Bank wd. object to this. ii) They might raise

whole ques of preferential rates, wh. we have persuaded them to

tolerate.

x| Wd. prefer to make it clear to Fedn. &amp; to Bank tht. in our view contract

| shd. not be awarded to a firm whose bid is better than next

merely because of a subsidy.

It is still our broad interest to retain open tendering. It does, on

balance, give us a cut at other people’s money.

L.P. C.R.O. support H.M.’s view.

We have good-will of Fedn. Govt. – tho’ they are limited by Bank’s

rules. They will use any argument they can for preferring our

contractors.

P.T. Submitted my memo. mainly to draw attention to attack wh. we are

likely to have to meet. Viz., £13M. from our reserves to give

contracts to Italy &amp; France. We can defend un-tied loans. But

other countries do tie loans. True U.S. give other dollars rent

free.But those who are getting these contracts haven’t done so.

And if it’s clear tht. they have subsidised tenders, we are in

trouble in H/C. It wd. be helpful in H/C. to be able to say tht.,

where there was subsidy, countervailing amount was added to

6

tender.

H.M. Wd. still prefer x/. on this.

Willing to review policy of tied loans. But v. big issues in that.

A.L.B. This is at least revenue-earning for sterling area. Gives power to the

copper companies.

H.M. Wd. accept P.T.’s suggn. if I thght. it wd. gain more orders. But don’t

want to do it solely to ease our posn. in H/C, w’out being sure

where it wd. lead us in practice.

P.T. Wd. be happier about H.M.’s plan if Fedn. agreemt. to that cd. be

secured &amp; announced.

[Enter E.H.

8. Aswan Dam.

S.Ll. Looks as tho’ E. &amp; Sudan will agree.

P.M. Don’t want to go on.

Examine again &amp; find diffies.

9. Singapore.

A.L.B. Marshall has offered to accept our plan – provided action on reserve

powers O-in-C. has to carry affirmative resolution in Parlt.

Will see them informally to-day : will say tht. I will go on, on this

basis, if they will drop all their other points. – e.g. Govr. Genl.

&amp; C.R.O. vice C.O.

P.M. Labour Party will try to take credit for this. Don’t try too hard to

save Marshall’s face.

K. Sp. emergency powers for e.g. 14 days. More permanent exercise of

reserve powers, or suspension of constitution, shd. need draft

order for affirm. resoln. before submn. to Queen. If Parlt. in

recess, power for order to last until Parlt. resumed when its

approval wd. be required.

A.L.B. Govr. has returned to Singapore.

Unnecessary to bring him back.

Agreed.

7

10. Restrictive Practices Bill.

P.T. Strong reason that Bill shd. extend to steel industry.

But Realisation Agency said they cdn’t sell remaining large cos. if the

Industries Fund were negotiable under Bill.

Solution now found meets views of Agency &amp; Fedn. – tho’ it does not

wholly please Steel Bd. Chairman, who really wants legn.

strengthening powers of Bd.

Raises awkward ques. Better not therefore raise it too soon.

K. is willing to take it in H/Lords.

Steel Bd. will not resign on this. A.F. will stay for at least

6 months – &amp; possibly for 12.

H.M. Grateful for P.T.’s efforts.

We cdn’t have met grievances of those who have bought shares.

I attach more importance to Bd. than P.T. does.

We don’t want successive Govts. to monkey with steel industry.

The Bd. was a feature of D.S.’s Bill – made industry half way

house betwn. natn. &amp; private enterprise. I want that compromise

to stand, even when Labour comes in again. It may not be poss.

to sell whole of industry.

I wd. therefore have preferred tht. amendment shd. cover other

agreements made under authority of Bd. Of course Fedn. don’t

like Bd. v. much, but they stand for unfettered private enterprise.

For these reasons I wd. prefer to defer final decision until after

Whitsun.

P.T. If steel were taken right out of Bill, my posn. wd. be v. diff. indeed.

H.M. More than logic is sometimes needed. Concessions have sometimes

to be made.

P.M. I don’t want a row with Bd.

P.T. This amendment involves a considerable pol. risk to Bill.
