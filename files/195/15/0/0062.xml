C.M. 104(56). 20th December, 1956.

1. Suez Canal. [Enter E.H.

A.H. E. Govt. have called off surrender of contractors’ men because Fr. are removg. their p.o.w. Can we put immedte. pressure on Fr. Govt.

S.Ll. Message from P.M. to Mollet is needed. Agreed.

A.H. Local Fr. commr. has disembarked other ranks: trying to fly back officers.

Later. Fr. F.O. are in agreemt. &amp; trying to influence Fr. M/D.

2. Parliament.

L.P.S. Business for next week.

3. House of Lords Reform.

L.P. Can’t canvass opinion in H/L. until Cab. have made firm choice on para 2.

Other points: i) Church of Scotland : as in para. 9. I am not in favour of altering no. of bishops (para. 8) tho’, if total size of House is reduced, their propn. will be increased. We ought therefore to sound Cantuar before aproachg. Ch/Scotland.

ii) Cttee. of Selection. Dislike proportionate repn. of Parties because it will lead to same method for selection of hereditary element in the House. Hence formula in para. 10.

iii) ex-Cab. Ministers. As in para. 12. No reason to exempt them fr. normal process of selection.

Ministers. As in 13-17. P.M. must have elasticity to promote a Minister to H/L. Meet that by keeping 2 or 3 vacancies.

iv) Swamping. Unnecessary because powers have bn. so far reduced.

P.M. On i) what of R.C.’s?

L.P. Cd. resist because not established. Nor do they want it.

J.S. Agree tht. this need not raise other claims. Support L.P.’s plan.

P.M. On ii) I support new formula.

B.H. How wd. it be done?

227

L.P. I wd. agree a list privately with leaders of other Parties, and put it formally to vote of House.

H. On iii) 200 hereditary Peers wd. mean only 160 back-bench Peers.

L.P. Yes : but we shd. get a better House. Cdn’t defend automatic addition of any ex-Minister, however ill qualified.

S. Wd. give younger Peers a better chance if H.’s view were followed.

E.H. On (iv) argument in H/C. will be : new House will be Conservative : a Tory Govt. cd. repeal Parlt. Act and, once that was done, a Labour Govt. cdn’t restore it having no power to threaten swamping.

L.P. New Labour Govt. wd. introduce a Bill ……..

Technically possible : but no Tory Govt. wd. pass such a Bill.

They might increase powers of H/L. i.e. cut down Parlt Act but wdn’t abolish it.

L.P. Will consider further how that theoretical point cd. be answered.

After discussion – particular points approved but subject to

further considn. by L.P. of (iii) (a) and (iv).

L.P.S. By wording of Q. Speech, we can have debate in H/L. on plan to which Govt. are not finally committed. Recommend tht. this debate be held on basis of comprehensive scheme. We can still reserve our decn. wtr or not to go fwd. with Bill.

H.A. Wise to test opinion in that way. May be more feeling in H/C. than we assumed.

L.P.S. Oppn. may be less troublesome than we feared. A.B. is contemptuous rather than hostile. But a section of Tories wd. prefer not to touch constitution.

E.H. Also a feeling tht. Parlt. shd. give time now to serious practical problems of to-day.

D.E. What attitude shd. Ministers take during this public discussion.

L.P. Wd. want first to test opinion of Tory Peers. If they will support it, I wd. deploy scheme publicly w’out commitment. Wd. keep door open to saying, if great division of opinion, tht. it wasn’t worth going on. If we did decide to go on, there cd. be a White Paper describing it still as a draft Scheme.

D.E. Even so, if asked my opinion on this plan, I shall find it difficult to say that I approve it.

228

P.M. We can all say aren’t committed.

Agreed : Proceed as proposed by L.P.

L.P. Payment. Shd. not be part of reform. But posn. is getting v. diff. indeed. If I had to choose, I wd. sooner have payment than reform.

4. Singapore.

A.L.B. Dangerous to tailor constitutional change to a particular Minister. But there is no source of support for us in S. other than L.Y. Hok.

a. Internal security. Existg. power to interfere is never in fact used : even

now only action wh. Govr. wd. think of taking is to suspend the constitn.

L.Y. Hok is willing to have internal security handled by a Cttee. under U.K. Chairman with a repve. of Malaya : so arranged that these 2 cd. out-vote others. He is ready to represent this as consistent with full internal self-govt. Recommend tht. we shd. accept this.

Power to suspend constitn. wd. remain. Sanctions for this wd. be shaky. But they are now. Col. Secy. who has power over Police now cdn’t use it w’out support of Ministers. Good prospect of retaining a no. of senior Police apptmts. (Europeans) over next 6 years – and thereafter wd. be handled by a Police Service Commn. or even Internal Security Council vice elected Ministers.

b. Governor General. They want local man after interim period of 1 or

2 years. He wd. be figure-head – and we cdn’t therefore leave our reserve powers to him. Must therefore have a repve. of U.K. Govt. with real powers. Repves. of A &amp; N.Z. and Commr. Genl. support this. Plan is tht. Commr. Genl. shd. hold this office. This wd. give us reality, but not trappings.

There will be break-down in March if we can’t meet him on these 2 points. Want to tell him this week tht. we expect to be able to do so.

L.P. Most unhappy to take decision on a matter of this importance without more thought.

Taking a big risk on L.Y.H. remaining in office.

K. Support A.L.B.’s plan. It is realistic approach. We can’t hold the base in future w’out a friendly population.

L.P.S. U.K. repve., when he suspends constitn., will have real power. Other diffy. remains viz., he acts in conflict with Queen’s repve.

A.L.B. Will consider this betwn. now &amp; March.

Repeated his formula.

P.M. Surely you can tell him now tht. Cab. hasn’t bn. able to consider :

229

| promise him a clearer view via Scott after Xmas : m’while

x| indicate tht. yr. own view is sympathetic.

H. Agree it wd. be wise to settle on (a) – a good bargain. But (b) isn’t at all clear, yet.

S.Ll. Better prs. on (b) to provide tht. Queen’s repve. shd. accept advice on some matters fr. Ch. Minister &amp; on others fr. U.K. repve. : with proviso tht. if constn. is suspended U.K. repve. becomes Queen’s repve.

L.P. Power of U.K. Govt. to suspend constitn. can’t last. When it disappears we may find we have created a v. dangerous precedent.

H.M. Don’t miss reality because constitl. diffies.

D.E. Easterners respect appearances.

A.L.B. Ready to speak on lines of x/ – if I can make it clear tht. we [think] hope it offers basis for settlement.

H. Not only “mechanics” : don’t say that.

I.M. And discuss with him what he will say on return.

5. Economic Situation. [Enter B.C., R.T.

H.M. Statement on general economic position. [Exit B.C., R.T.

6. Egypt : Sterling Balances.

H.M. Propose to allow drawing technically, but to block payment. Will amount to same thing, but will look better qua sterling.

S.Ll. Shd. we not consider legn. to protect (in U.K.) assets of Suez Canal Co.

D.E. Cd. we increase squeeze on E. by preventing shipments – to delay point at wh. U.S. will give E. credit.

P.M. No early risk of that – U.S. public opinion wd. be much against it. There may be help to rehabilitate Canal – money for that wd. give ground for internatl. control (in U.S. view).

H.M. E. have approached U.S. re drawing on I.M.F. Propose to tell U.S. we wd. sooner see any help to E. deferred : also her credit-worthiness shd. be weighed. But I.M.F. shd. remember we have

230

made drawing &amp; shd. avoid takg. sides. We shd. not therefore press our points : &amp; if it came to vote we shd. abstain.

7. Motor Industry.

H.M. Deputn. to me &amp; P.T. y’day. In parlous state – partly because over-expansion partly because recent events. Little we can do to help. But propose –

i) Petrol for overseas visitors. 20.000 cars sold in that way. Fr. have done this : we cd. follow suit.

ii) E.C.G. Dpt. can explain facilities available.

iii) P. tax : they ask for redn of both this &amp; H.P. deposit. Diff to

throw away revenue on P.T. But deposit cd. be reduced

from 50% to 20%.

L.P.S. Don’t like giving way on disinflationary policies. Stress fact that this is isolated.

H.M. Addl. diffy. of petrol justifies makg. an exceptn.

P.T. Unless we act, prodn. will be down by 50% this year.

I.M. Generally, it is difficult – order, counter-order etc., But this can be represented as exceptional. If we are to do it, must do it v. quickly.

8. United States Loan.

H.M. Alternatives : i) change of clause 6(3) or ii) new agreement. Doubt if i) will do – for anythg. acceptable to us is likely to be rejected by Congress. Prefer therefore to go for ii). Give provn. enabling U.K. Govt. at its own option to claim deferment, until end of whole period, of paymt. of interest and capital. Try for 9 such bisques : we mght get 7. No test of need : sole discretion to U.K. Govt.

Approved.

9. Local Government Finance. [Enter D.S.

Main ques. to be considered after Xmas.

D.S. to be authorised to make a statement to-day foreshadowing introdn. of short Bill.

231

10. Kashmir.

H. P.Q. by Beamish to-day. Proposed answer goes a little further than we have gone before.

Policy shd. be discussed at greater length after Xmas.
