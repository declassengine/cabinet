C.C.46(62) 12th July 1962

1. Parliament. [Enter M.R.

I.M. Business for next week.

Public Service Pensions – announce Tuesday in reply to P.Q. by Harvey – to be answered at end of Ques.

[Enter E.P.

2. Smoking and Health.

Hail. Difficult. No doubt about scientific basis. But raises diff. ques. of paternalism. Also, butter/milk and thrombosis : what if that is brought out : v. awkward.

Must do something, while avoiding pitfalls. If you tell l.a.‟s the facts, you are discouraging smoking. We must therefore be prepared to admit we are discouraging it.

Only point of difference : taxation. Finally for Ch/Excheq. But want him to know that people‟s approach to cigarettes will continually be cautious &amp; this will have some effect on revenue. I favour some differentiation; and I believe a small one wd. be enough in support of our propaganda.

K. Hope no action will be taken until next session. We are unpopular now : at least we aren‟t open to ridicule. Justify having this alone pro.tem. on ground that we have more important things to do.

Hail. Committed, both Houses to some statement.

P.M. We can‟t prohibit : nor deal with taxation at the moment. We have done something with l.a.‟s : only problem is wthr. we can now do some more propaganda.

E.M. I cd. secure Reg. prohibiting smoking in buses &amp; more non-smoking carriages on rlways.

Ch.H. Concentrate on health education line : confine ourselves to that and intensify our effort on it.

J.H. Facts shd. be made known to young – adults shd. be left to choose.

Hail. At least let us do para.4 : can‟t afford to do less.

H.B. Support Ch. H.‟s line + perhaps discouraging smoking in food shops.

P.M. Limit action accordingly.

Let a draft statement be circulated to Cabinet.

Statement as near as possible to Recess.

R.A.B. Not sure we need make a statement at all.

[Enter R.W., P.M.G.

3. Incomes Policy.

a) Incomes Commission.

P.M. Discuss proposal for Standing Commn.

R.A.B. This Commn. wd. do no violence to arbitn. &amp; wd. have no powers to compel. Is this enough? Public service 21(vii) – (ix) doesn‟t amount to much.

Prob. enough for private sector.

Para 16. Cd. we do more to ensure tht. arbitration have economic facts?

Cd. the Commn. not have this duty? Facts via advice.

H.B. Do we agree tht. public service pay must be broadly comparable with pay outside? If we do, we can‟t hold p. sector to levels or standards which are being disregarded outside. Staff sides etc. will resist any plan which seems likely to leave them behind.

H.W. If you accept that, brings you back to problem of arbitrator working in isolation. Must be some way of ensuring tht. arbitrator is told what the national considns. are wh. we shd. take into a/c.

Otherwise Govt. spokesman shd. appear before arbitn.

Hail. Arbitn. is mainly public sector &amp; then we can secure tht. Govt. view is represented.

R.M. Genl. views wd. be no advance on COPPI., which didn‟t work.

But if you go further you seem to be “influencing” arbitration.

J.H. Some arbitrators rounded on R. Commn. They felt i) good way of dealing with ad hoc enquiries ii) ex post facto pronouncements wd. not have much effect iii) if R.C. pronounced &amp; arbitn. followed, this wd. embarrass them. In reply, we argued tht. it wd. be less embarrassing than expn. of view by Govt. themselves. iv) favoured making Franks &amp; Kindershy panels of R. Commn.

H.B. Staff Side view : e.g. if banks give 5% increase annually to typists Staff Side won‟t go to a body instructed to adhere to 2½%.

P.T. Can‟t imagine any recent claim which wd. have gone to R. Commn.

M. Fin. News this a.m. – Govt. policy has caused arbitrators to give higher awards than they wd. otherwise have done. Remember it was T.U.

opposn. that ended compulsorily arbitn. : believe T.U.C. wd. be strongly opposed to this R.C.

K. In past years many ad hoc enquiries into private sector claims : great advantage to be able to put all these in future to a continuing body.

Useful also for para.19 cases.

Valuable also in dealing with workers who can‟t be directly related to productivity standard.

Agree with R.A.B. on second sentence in para.16 : had hoped this cd. be done.

P.M. Diffy. on para.16 : how cd. R.C. advise arbitrator w‟out going into merits of particular claim.

H.B. It wd. also involve re-negotiating arbitn. agreement with C. Service.

K. Para.13.19.14 and 15 (even without 16) wd. give us something.

S.LI. Informal soundings with T.U.C. in confidence, &amp; employers.

Employers were enthusiastic over R.C. to examine ex post facto – appeal to p. opinion, in effect. T.U.C. repves. asked a) cd. R.C. investigate profits &amp; prices or cd. they consider profits &amp; prices generally. We said in reply tht. in general recommns. they wd. be able to take this into a/c. b) What of workers lagging behind? Cd. they go to R.C., unilaterally? I said this wd. be for Govt. to decide &amp; refer.

P.M. Read draft of public statement. [Enter J.M.

S.LI. T.U. repves. urged tht. no more than outline shd. be announced at first stage so that detailed discns. with both sides of industry cd. be held.

E.P. To make Kindershy a panel of this R.C. wd. be regarded as breach of faith by B.M.A. because of review body is one which is not subordinated to Govt. policy.

D.E. Confirms my fear that p. service cases won‟t go to R.C. because they fear tht. national interest will be added to what arbitrator considers.

Key to this is how far can you get private sector to respect R.C. policy.

Get guiding light into public conscience &amp; then get R.C. accepted as machinery for departing from it (upwards or downwards). Persuade employers who contemplate going above g. light tht they shd. go to R.C. &amp; get this under-written.

Is it necessary tht. both parties shd. agree to go to R.C.? Cd. cases

x/ go if desired by one party endorsed by Govt.

J.H. The other side wd. then refuse to plead.

I.M. Favour D.E.‟s proposal – residual power in Govt. to say tht. in national interest claim shd. go.

R.A.B. This wd. cure the difficulty I saw in 21(vii). If it cd. be done, my point (at outset of discn.) wd. be met. [It would not, in fact, for it wdn‟t apply to C. Service.]

P.T. Still fear tht. as in memo. no one will go to this R.C.

S.LI. There will be compulsory power to have ex post facto enquiry.

Ch.H. If you cd. give R.C. function in reln. to underpaid groups, you might get x/&amp; thus meet P.T.‟s fear that no cases will go.

P.M. We mght have compulsory enquiry, tho‟ not compulsory award.

E.M. Ex post facto reports may not achieve remedial action. eg. tally clerks.

b) General Background.

P.M. New share of wage negotiation – no longer matter of workers getting more out of employers, but both getting more out of consumer. There is therefore new element of public interest.

Expansion. Dissent from today‟s Times, tho‟ inspired by Mr. Barber. We are running below capacity (eg. steel) and we have increasing numbers coming out of decaying industries who will have to be re-employed. Capitalism is indefensible unless it provides for large opportunities of trade: employment.

If we cd. get general assent to proposn. tht. incomes shd. not out-run prodn., we cd. afford to run economy at full stretch. We must preach this policy.

S.LI. Regret the a.m.‟s Press. Gives impression of complacency wh. is not true.

H. R.A.B.‟s point, if fluffed, might spoil the whole presentation.

Hope we can do something on lines of x/.

I.M. Presentation : weak passage on profits. Wonder if we can‟t devise means of going further on profits. Wd. make it easier for T.U.‟s.

P.M. Cd. be included in ex post facto enquiries.

Hail. Mention it in commn. with reference to management efficiency.

R.M. This is not perfect. But it is a start. And logically inevitable in present circs. &amp; cd. be made apparent. [Exit R.W.

Hail. Sit in larger frame (efficiency &amp; expansion) it might be accepted.

H.W. Also cd. be represented as proposal, and a start, to be developed, not as a cut &amp; dried scheme.

H.B. On x/ cd. we provide for compulsory reference in any field where there is no machinery for arbitration.

M. This is a plan for bldg. courts of enquiry into industrial system, which T.U.‟s have always opposed. Believe they will oppose this.

C.S. Revaluation shd. extend to private, as well as public sector. This wd. give T.U.‟s a greater interest in going to Commn.

H.B. In parallel with soundings of T.U.C., may I have authority to sound officials of Staff Side, equally in confidence.

S.LI. Appointmt. of this R.C. wd. make it easier to continue N.E.D.C.

Agreed : P.M. and his Cttee. to work further on

detail in light of Cab. discussion.
