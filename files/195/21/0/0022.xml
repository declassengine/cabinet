C .C.57(62) 20th September 1962

1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter Devonshire.

H. a) Germany. The R. relief came in a bus. U.S./R. talks unlikely to be resumed until Nov.

b) Congo. Teams have gone to E‟ville to work out some of plan, but A.

has refused to go to K. to discuss constitutional proposals – we have suggd. tht. teams go to all the Provinces. M‟while fighting in North K.

c) U.N. Assembly. Disarmament &amp; tests likely to be prominent. On tests W. proposals are good &amp; likely to put R. in diffies. in N. York.

P.M. U.S. &amp; R. tests may be over by late autumn. May there be scope for a new initiative at top level. Might suggest another prelim. mtg. of scientists.

But doubt myself whether we shall make much progress on inspection.

2. Commonwealth Meeting.

P.M. Factors affectg. mtg. a) Negotiations not complete – tho‟ pattern is clear enough in outline. b) Timing turned out convenient in end : wd. have bn. harder if more arrangements had bn. concluded.

c) In spite of continuing consultn. C‟wealth P.M.‟s did not understand our basic reasons for thinking accession. Believe they now do.

d) Had thought our diffies. wd. be with old Doms. – for our deal for Africans and Asians was v. satisfactory. African rejection was a political reaction v. Europeans. Some may change their attitude : some may recognise this as unifying (not divisive) factor in Africa.

Asians – reduced to a problem of date of exposure to c. tariff.

Canadians : broad opposition. A. driving hard bargain. N.Z. relying on us to look after them.

Bad start – but got better. My final speech – outlined principle for communiqué. Final result pretty satisfactory.

What underlies this? Rifts w‟in C‟wealth. What can we discuss?

Shows that it can‟t be coherent economic or political unit.

E.H. They were much affected by Oppn. consultns. and Gaitskell. This affected their opening speeches. Lau‟s influence in this and in inspiring Africans‟ opposition. cf. Desai‟s speech at Accra.

Communiqué emphasises points wh. they think important – tho‟ true tht. it involves us in no new commitments. Means tht. on assocn. we must try to get something difft. for Africans.

Asians – no gt. diffy. in getting early negotiation. Suspension of tariff wd. be more difficult.

Old Doms. V. little discussion on materials etc. because Canadians not really willing to discuss. Long session on foodstuffs. Important to

make it publicly clear what they are seeking viz., access, plus future level of prices at which they will be able to sell to enlarged Community – if not by Community, guarantee by us. We cdn‟t give this, in or out.

Truth is that this sort of assurance cd. only be secured in internatl. agreemt. What they want is remunerative prices, on their costs – viz., tht. we shd. guarantee to pay for A. inflation. But C. and N.Z. do not support this approach because they are efficient producers.

N.Z. discussed nature of a special protocol. Marshall going to Brussels next week and with us will discuss with Commission. They have accepted idea of a share of market vice absolute quantities.

F.E. Lofty ideal of C‟wealth has bn. spoiled by this Mtg.

What common ground is there in it now. Little but selfishness.

This was no more than commercial negotiations.

Hail. This was nowhere near as bitter as Ottawa. Nothing new.

P.T. F.E.‟s concln. wd. be premature. Cdn‟t have expected much else from this mtg.

Need to arrest drift of public opinion in U.K.

I.M. Support that – memo. circulated. Can‟t hope to swing this far until we are in posn. to say we wish to join E.E.C.

Hail. Remember we have given pledges. Can‟t go too far until we can show we shall reduce these. We cd. do more to expound advantages.

H.B. Bring out diffies. we wd. have if we stayed out. Wrong comparison is being made. This wd. not be so embarrassing to E.H.

More worried over B. agric than over C‟wealth.

E.M. Stress diffies. of getting B. goods into C‟wealth.

E.P. Need for speed in completing negotns.

P.T. Go over to line : overwhelmg. case for going in – tho‟ it‟s possible that in negotns. we shan‟t get necessary terms.

[Exit Devovnshire., E.H.

[Enter J.A.

3. Export of Arms : M/East.

H. Do we sell missiles to Israel and Arabs?

Long-standg. agreement with French U.S. to do nothg. to disturb balance of arms in M/E. Recemtly U.S. renewed this. But now they

are proposing to offer missiles to Israel – for electoral reasons (Jewish vote). Israelis will then want to buy from U.S. We protested v. breach of agreement : also v. proposal on merits because of provocation to Arabs. Clear now that politically they are resolved. Shall we counter by offering our missiles to Israel This wd. enrage Arabs, on whom we are more dependent than U.S. Disposed therefore to let U.S. take Arab &amp; discuss first : then later offer to consider on merits applns. for missiles from Israel and Arabs.

J.A. doesn‟t want to miss chance of orders because plight of industry.

U.S. have told Jews in N. Yk. we are possible source of supply.

He thinks we shd. tell Israel we are ready to offer – privately.

Then we shd. get all bad reaction and prob. lose the order.

J.A. Two new factors since I agreed with H.

i) Israeli‟s have asked us in Tel-a-Viv wthr. we wd. also offer to supply.

ii) Jewish group told by W‟ton we are poss. source of supply. If it leaks we shall get all odium with no chance of the order.

Can‟t we therefore answer i) privately; &amp; say same to friendly Arabs.

H. Can‟t believe Israel wd. give the order to us, vice U.S. – for in their interest to involve U.S. in their defence.

If ii) leaks, it need not involve us.

P.M. As soon as somethg. comes out, we can say tht. as agreement has broken down, we are ready to supply in principle to either side.

H. We shall have gt. diffies. in deciding what we shall supply to Arabs.

P.T. Believe Israel will buy Hawk – for reasons given by H. But they will approach us first, in order to get lowest price from U.S.

P.M. Then we shall be embroiled politically w‟out getting the order.

Agreed : no sufficient advantage to us to intervene before

the news leak.

[Exit J.A.

4. Agricultural Policy : Farm Improvement Scheme.

Note not taken.

General agreement – dispose of this in the way best calculated to give the impression that this grant is going on unchanged.
