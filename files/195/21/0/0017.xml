C.C.52(62) 1st August 1962

1. Aden. [Enter M.R.

P.M. Shd. we try to get sovereign enclaves for our bases.

D.S. Gt. advantages – as shown by Cyprus.

Clear we shan‟t be able to hang on in Aden unless Colony is merged with Fedn. The Ministers (Colony) and Sheikhs (Fedn.) momentarily favour it – tho‟ it wd. be opposed by numerical majority in Aden on a free vote.

Their proposal includes provision for us to take out of Fedn. whole or part of Colony. This cd. cover our defence areas. Ques. : shd. we go further &amp; demarcate defence areas now – introducing a defence flavour into this clause. They are mixed up with rest of Colony : but some areas (e.g. airport) are easily demarcated.

P.T. Aden is a crucial base – now perhaps more than any.

Understand D.S. is trying to help. Common ground – merger of Colony &amp; Fedn. with sovereignty over format. D.S. plan : carve our enclaves &amp; retain sovereignty over these even if we lost it over rest of Colony. Differs. fr. Cyprus : Colony as a whole v. small and so high a proportn. of Adenese in each “enclave” tht. you can hardly split them off. Govr. and C.O.S. say it wd. damage their posn. to make this proposal.

P.M. V. well : we must thrash this out – on a later occasion.

D.S. Warn Cab. that if we carry this merger (against majority‟s wish in Aden) there will be trouble, locally. Even so, I believe it is in our interest and also in that of inhabitants.

P.M. Carry on with main policy. Consider conclave idea – Friday.

[Exit D.S.

2. Dr. Robert Soblen. [Enter Att. G.

H.B. Solrs. decided not to appeal to H/L.

Israel “ not to admit him there.

Medical condn. Lukaemia – now in suspense : can‟t live, but can‟t say how long. Mght live for weeks or up to 4 years.

Not so easy. For espionage is not extraditable : A.O. satisfied if a man r.l.l. goes anywhere. Medical condn. : Opposn. pressure that dying man shd. not be sent back to U.S. Under A.O. I can send him to his own country, or to country whence he came, or to a country willing to accept him. But on balance I recommend he goes back to U.S.

R.A.B. Possible to strain A.O. powers as H.B. suggests. But see no reason

why he shd. not go to Czechoslovakia.

H. Clear he shd. go back to U.S.

D. No legal diffy. in returning him to U.S.

Politics : serious case of espionage : our duty is to ensure tht. his interrupted journey be resumed.

Agreed : Send him to U.S. on Friday.

[H.B. to inform 3 M.P.‟s by letter and leave them to raise it in H/C. if they wish – on Thursday or Friday.]

[Exit Att.G.

3. Cotton. [Enter Tilney.

F.E. As in memo.

P.M. Unfortunate that P. is smallest exporter of the three. But, if they get away with this, they will go back on their agreement.

J.T. This action is consistent with warnings given to Pak. and we support it.

But consequence may be : complaints that India has a higher quota : weaken P.‟s connn. with C‟wealth : reduce President‟s support for C.M. : weaken P.‟s support of Cento. etc.

E.M. P. has bn. rough with our shipping.

R.M. Even so, we can‟t avoid doing this.

P.T. Cd. we give them longer notice.

F.E. Present arrangement will go on to end/year in any case.

P.M. Method cd. be reserved for discn. – includg. President during P.M.M.

F.E. Cd. do this with cloth : but yarn is more urgent &amp; they might flood our market with that.

P.M. Unlikely before Sept.

Agreed in substance : consult on method : tell India

and H. Kong that in one way or another the agreement

will go on. F.E. and D.S. to concert method.

4. Legislation Programme.

I.M. x/ Legn. on Contract of Service (M/L) might be better than either on 6(b).

P.M. Might need legn. on N.I.C. – power to call witnesses.

J.H. Tory pressure for x/. to be included in Speech.

D. Adminn. of Justice – now only 15 clauses : urgent need, on investment of funds paid into court. Also cases where non aided litigant wins v. opponent legally aided and can‟t recover his costs.

This wd. be another Bill of 15 clauses, possibly with 6(c).

R.M. Companies Deposits – lack of legn. cd. get us into scandal at any time.

P.M. Ty. shd. see wthr. substance of investment by courts cd. be cured w‟out legn.

Agreed : Add C&amp; P. Bill.

Reserve decision on 6(b) until Contract of

Service Bill is defeated.

5. Public Expenditure.

a) Estimates.

B.C. As in memo. Seek guidance on wthr. Cab. wd. wish to attack any particular area. Normal scrutiny of Estimates won‟t yield much.

R.M. Expre. rising by about 8% and income by not more than 4%.

P.M. Tolerable if economy is seen to be expanding.

R.M. Believe difficulty will be political rather than economic.

On guidance : I wd. welcome early mtg. with Ministerial group.

b) Public Service Investment.

B.C. These figures are agreed with Dpts.

I have taken it tht. Cab. wished 1st priority to go to housing.

There is also £16 m. extra for educn. minor works This operates quickly and involves no long commitment.

Even so £94 m. above current year – increase of 9½% This must be judged in light of S.LI.‟s 6% statement. Presentation : para.16. – defer announcement until autumn. K.J. wd. like to publish and take credit for it : but I don‟t agree.

J.H. Para.12. Hope effort will be made to put jobs in areas not over-strained.

P.M. Will ask M/W. to look at this. R.M. to discuss with him &amp; try to work out a plan.

[Exit R.A.B.

6. Education : Supply of Teachers.

E.B. Expectations disappointed by i) increased births ii) wastage of teachers because of marriage – which means that 50% of work of training colleges is wasted after 4 yrs.

On ii) we must tackle ques. of bringing back married women.

x/ Increase through-put of colleges – by all means short of reverting to 2 years. But I don‟t want to do latter : resented by teachers as down-grading status : also by colleges and Universities.

N. Advisory Council have formally recommended expansion of college to yield another 10.000 teachers. Cost £40 m. already by ‟68 : this wd. add another £6 m. p.a. But I shall be under pressure esp. if I press x/. Wd. like therefore to admit tht. there will have to be some expansion, tho‟ I don‟t want to quantify it at present.

B-C. Wd. wish to examine quantity : but no objn. to his starting talks on basis he now indicates.

Edn. Estimates already up by £40 m. odd.

M.N. Support E.B.

B.C. Age of entry (5) shd. not be wholly excluded.

H.B. Cdn‟t do this in election year.

E.P. Keep an eye on birth rate. It might change.

Wd. like to join (nurses) in any survey of obstacles in getting married women back to profession.

E.B. Any increase in price of school meals shd. be linked with progress on teachers (because of cost of latter).

7. Covent Garden Market.

C.S. As in memo.

Refraining from legn. will delay them by 6 months or so.

P.M. Tell them Parlt. wdn‟t pass a Bill in that form.

Memo. approved.

8. Shipping : Docks.

E.M. Method of handling Rochdale Rpt.

Considering W. Paper indicating which recommns. we accept.

Shd. we have a Nat. Ports Authy. on a non statutory basis?

D. What powers cd. it have?

E.M. None – but cd. start collecting informn. and framing advice.

R.M. Favour that.

E.P.C. to look at Rpt.

M.N. Sc. Dpt. to be kept in touch.
