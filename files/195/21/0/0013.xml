C.C.48(62) 19th July 1962

1. Parliament. [Enter M.R.

I.M. Business for next week – amended.

Oppn. still urging debate on C.M.; one day is available : hard to resist.

Pilkington : balance now in favour of take note because Censure debate &amp; desire to avoid divn.

Hail. 2 day debate on C.M. in H/L. Keen interest in political side – we shall be asked for assurance we wd. never accept federal system.

E.H. H/C. I wd. prefer to rely on progress report Mon. &amp; following Mon. + public statement of progress if negotns. continue after H/C. has arisen. Agreed.

2. Legislation Programme.

I.M. C. and D. lists have no chance save as private members‟ Bills.

P.M. Large backlog. Suggests system has broken down.

I.M. It has : and we shd. try to find means of reform : but not in last session of Parlt.

E.M. Must do something : cf. Severn Bridge and Underground Garages, both urgently needed.

H.B. Agreed timetable (or imposed) for Cttee. Stages, in particular.

D.S. Add to A-Z Bill to extend scope of C.D. Corpn.

P.M. Consider adding it to C.D. &amp; W. (Amendment).

I.M. Main P‟mme Bills. Suggest B. I. plus first three Bills in B.2.

P.T. Before final decn., J.A. shd. have chance to put his view on Airports Authority.

P.M. London Govt. Is it necessary? 100 Clauses.

I.M. Guillotine from the start. M.R. Cttee. upstairs.

R.A.B. &amp; Essential, politically, to do it. Now is the opportunity &amp; we

H.B. &amp; J.B.C must grasp it.

D. Administration of Justice Bill : short, non controversial, urgent.

Shd. be taken this coming session.

H.B. C. and Y. Persons : non controversial : ready : cd. start in H/L.

I.M. But it &amp; C. Justice (Scotland) are each 60 Clauses : can‟t do both.

M.N. Essential part is legal aid clauses.

I.M. Let me try to restrict it to that.

D.S. Common Scholarships. Shd. go higher.

I.M. Will consult with Ministers concerned in F.L. Cttee.

x/ and put final view on B.2.

E.M. Will all Bills in C. be reviewed?

F.E. W. &amp; Measures is political asset, tho‟ v. dull.

Agreed as at x/.

3. Truck Acts.

J.H. As in memo. At this stage seek only authority to hold consultns. – no commitment to legislation.

B.C. Must make it clear at outset tht. this won‟t affect Crown.

P.M. Play it slow because we cdn‟t find time to legislate.

4. Commercial Policy : Japan.

F.E. Remaining ques. is wool.

Two safeguards for Br. industry. Sensitive list must be as small as possible because of existence of other. My proposal, after P.M.‟s talk with industry‟s deputation, is to include all woollen cloth on the sensitive list. To go further wd. give more safeguards to wool than to any other U.K. industry.

H. Clinch this agreement quickly because of change of Govt. in Japan.

F.E. Our exports to J. are up by 20% &amp; exceed theirs to us.

Much to gain from this Treaty.

P.M. Impressed by case made by wool industry.

Safeguard on imports : right to quota w‟in 30 days if threatened.

But sensitive list imposes it at once.

Cd. we as a gesture start by asking for all wool on s. list : and retreat under J. pressure to what F.E. suggests?

F.E. If we made concessions on this they wd. start to erode the rest.

Agreed – accept F.E.‟s plan.

industry to be informed.

5. Works of Art : Leonardo.

P.M. Saw Chairman of R.A. He has refused to extend time limit beyond 15/8, by which time fund is likely to have reached £400.000.

R.M. Not practicable now to split the difference. We must let it go to auction or put up the balance. But we cd. get further contribn. fr. N. Gallery or charge for admission to it, or to Gallery as a whole.

P.M. If we do buy it, unsafe to exhibit it for a time.

R.A.B. Doubtful wthr. we ought to put up this sum.

R.A. ruthless in exploiting posn.

B.C. N. Gallery has annual grant of £100.000. We cd. annex for this unexpended balance of this year and whole of next year‟s.

H.B. Suppose we put up £250.000 + this £100.000. We shd. get the rest – or R.A. wd. take a slightly lower price.

W.D. Sudden &amp; surprising revival of interest in artistic things.

Yet – participation in wholly inflationary movement (pictures).

Agreed - Ty. to save it, as best they can, for the nation.

6. Europe : Common Market Negotiations.

E.H. Timetable now agreed – incldg. mtg. in Oct.

Mtg. in Brussels tomorrow on agric. C.S. will accompany me. Final decns. can‟t be taken because Fr. Ministers won‟t be there. Decns. in following week. Four day mtg. : crux on temperate goods : Asian problem (when Six have accepted our package with one exception) – Desai‟s visit has bn. helpful. On temperate foods Six can‟t agree among themselves : we are trying a new approach.

Negotns. v. sensitive at all stages. Suggn. we are avoidg. vue d‟ensemble before O ct. because of P.M.M. Also tht. we shall ask for further concessions after it because they shd. make none now. Managed to remove these. Problem now : impn. of weakness of U.S. Govt. Speeches this weekend shd. re-affirm our policy on C.M.

Presentation. Hope W.D. will help on this.

H.G.‟s speech did much damage. Negative approach. Only interested in national planning in U.K. No reference to part which U.K. wd. play in the Community.

H. Pol,. importance of federal point raised by H.G. We must all take same line.

P.M. W.D. to circulate reduced version of E.H.‟s statement to W.E.U.

Before weekend.

R.A.B. Agriculture. Not until we know condns.on commodities can we go to farmers. Unlikely to get there before P.M.M. This will put us in dify. with Party &amp; agric. opinion. Wheat, beef &amp; milk will be crucial to us in the autumn.

E.H. Overall strategy can‟t be divided until Aug.

Commodities : trouble is they haven‟t formed policy themselves.

We shall try to get formula.

For general outline C‟wealth is most important. But hope to get agric. into line later at further Ministerial mtg.

C.S. Vast amount of detailed negotn. still to be done.
