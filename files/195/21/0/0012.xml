C.C.47(62) 17th July 1962

1. The Cabinet. [Enter M.R.

P.M. 11 yrs. since WSC formed Govt. I and R.A.B. only surviving members. Comment on „stagnations‟ of our pol. life. Recent changes made with sorrow on personal grounds – only duty urges one on.

Changes must be made quickly : once decided Minister is to go, he must go, otherwise loses confidence of public.

Welcome new Cabinet. Great tasks – and opportunity.

R.A.B. We understand your motives and personal diffies.

Support in this critical time and make the most of opportunity before next Election.

2. Foreign Affairs.

a) Laos.

H. Agreement due to be signed on Monday.

May not stick : but leaders are getting on well &amp; genuinely neutral Govt. may work.

b) Germany : Berlin.

H. Must resist Gromyko‟s demands on troops.

R. may sign a separate treaty.

Rigidity comes into it which I dislike.

P.M. There are 2 triumphs for Br. f. policy. U.S., 18 mos. ago, were about to drag us into war on both. We get no public credit for this and cannot claim it.

H.B. U.S. won‟t move when not under pressure and can‟t move when they are. O.G.‟s recent despatch.

H. True in general : but Rusk is not rigid in B‟lin. Diffy. is to find a good compromise. M‟while we are stalling until C.M. negotns. are concluded &amp; to avoid alienating Fr. &amp; G. opinion.

P.M. One change : econ. deterioration of E. Germany.

H. This may eventually give W. Germay more influence over E.

c) Congo.

H. U. Thant, man of peace, doesn‟t want to use force if he can help it.

Afro-Asians in U.N. quieter in the summer. But central Congo is bust

on ??? but going bust too. U.S. therefore favour force, to secure quick settlement. I disputed this with U. Thant : it wd. destroy only source of wealth in Congo.

M‟while A. &amp; T. talks have broken down. A. relying on U.S. help to forceful concln. : T. on his de facto autonomy. Pressure needed on both

x/ to bring them together. A. must produce real federal constitn. &amp; T. must provide for division of revenue – simultaneously. Allies agreed on this and on avoidg. S. Council discn. Disagreed on means of pressure on T. U.S./Fr. favour force : U.K./Belg. dislike economic pressure via Union Minière funds. We are pressing T. to supply 50% of revenue of Congo – tho‟ he insists on internatl. control.

We are in need x overleaf + U.N. scheme for technical assistance over period of years.

If resoln. authorising force were pressed, we wd. have to vote against.

I.M. Little feeling now in H/C.

H. We wd. not use veto. But if we disassociate ourselves, must we cancel subscription? Cd. be v. awkward pol. sitn.

R.A.B. Opinion in Party wd. be strongly v. use of force by U.N.

P.M. If both elements of x/ were proposed &amp; appeared reasonable, force to secure acceptance mght be more easily accepted. Objectives of force must be seen &amp; accepted as reasonable.

H. Also – if opinion publicly divided we shall be seen to be siding with S. Africa &amp; Portugal.

P.T. Wd. T. be ready to pay 50% of revenue to U.N.?

H. Mght be possible.

E.B. Use of veto wd. be unpopular with other elements in Party.

If money is problem, force is no soln. – can‟t that be got across to U.N. and U.S.

3. Parliament

I.M. Business for next week, &amp; following.

30/7. Debate on B‟casting. RAB &amp; PMG. Do we take note or approve

W.Paper. On first form, Oppn wd. not divide. But H/L. are to approve.

R.A.B. Better conform to H/L. motion.

I.M. Can we continue to stall on re-call of Parlt. for C.M. debate.

P.M. Can promise one more progress report by L.P.S. – and another

To public during recess. If pressed on re-call, I cld. say

Depends on sitn = if necessary, shall not hesitate to summon Parlt.

[indicated less enthusiasm now for recalling.]
