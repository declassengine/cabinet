C.C.49(62) 24th July 1962

1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter M.R.

a) Congo.

D. Trying to persuade T. that unless he accepts sharing revenue in return for better federal structure (of 2 Katanga Ministers), U.N. will apply economic sanctions.

S.C. may be held on 10/8, if no progress : &amp; strong resoln. then inevitable.

We shd. work for milder resoln. w‟out econ. sanctions : but U.S. wd. wish to be stiffer than U.K.

b) Berlin.

D. Indicns. at Geneva that R. may sign Treaty with E. Germany – but no indication of timetable.

c) Congo (resumed).

R.A.B. Have hinted to R.W. tht. we wd. be well advised to make reference to H. before venturing on public statement.

I.M. Will this mature before end/Session? H/C. wd. not favour financial support (Boards or otherwise) if resoln. embodying sanctions were passed.

R.A.B. Get clarity on timing viz-á-viz Parlt. And let H. bring it to P.M.

2. Europe.

3. Parliament.

[Enter de Ferranti.

4. Employment : Christchurch Aircraft Factory.

P.T. Some pol. arguments in favour of sale. M/A. criticised for not helping, where industry is concentrated.

H.B. Favour refusal. Lamentable tht. M/A. failed to inform B/T.

B.O.T.A.C.‟s offer inadequate. We must be seen now to be strengthening our D.I. policy.

R.A.B. Refuse to sell their factory to B.Oxygen.

B/T. to review operation of D.I. policy.

[Exit de F.

5. Incomes Policy.

R.M. Paras 3-4. Views of T.U.C. Better not to put this too high in first

announcement.

D.S. Doubt if it‟s strong enough.

Hail. Ultimate sanction of ex post facto remains.

D.S. Not sure this will be effective, but may be best we can do.

D. Believe this is as far as we can go.

Agreed : This is as far as speech shd. go.

R.M. Paras 5-6. Burnham can be linked. Kindershy &amp; Franks are more difficult. We shall have to say something at some stage : better say it as outset.

E.P. Accept P.M.‟s formula : but warn Govt. tht. it will provoke outburst from B.M.A. I recognise tht. some assocn. will be needed later : but K. is now working on his first review.

H.B. Say : this will have to be considered, in due course : because K at work.

Hail. Put that in reply to debate not in opening speech.

* Agreed : omit words “to carry out their valuable work” anyway.

R.M. Less harm in putting it in P.M.‟s speech, prs. in vaguer words.

E.B. Care needed also in reference to Burnham : stat rights &amp; duties of B. remain but all concerned will wish to consider relns. with R.C.

Either in P.M.‟s speech or in reply to debate.

H.B. * “consider in consultn. with” vice discuss. And omit “in what form”.

6. Colonial Development Corporation.

D.S. This change is desired on both sides of H/C.

Ty. control and ceiling wd. not be affected.

I.M. i) Agree it wd. be welcomed: but wd. occupy quite a bit of time.

ii) F. Legn. Cttee. can consider wthr. place in p‟mme can be found.

iii) No early announcement : keep it for Queen‟s Speech.

R.M. Urgency : staff of C.D.C. are evaporating.

Shd. be confined to C‟wealth countries.

No increase in ceiling.

R.A.B. Consider wthr. in form it shd. be restricted to post ‟48 countries even tho‟ it is so restricted in fact.

R.M. Keep it for Q. Speech if Howick can hold posn. by telling his chaps.

7. Shipping.

E.M. Statistics of composition of fleet.

Prospects for shipping and shipbuilding – as in memo.

Docks – not re-designed since passing of rlway age. Rochdale Rpt.

Seek authority to pursue line indicated in para.13.

Because of lack of co-opn. betwn. all sides of these indies. I proposed Maritime Bd. This shook them so seriously tht. I can hope for their support for my different approach.

B.C. Have not had detailed proposals in Ty. Won‟t be easy to find much money.

Hail. Hopeful approach to problem. D.S.I.R. will co-operate. Automation.

J.H. Welcome this. Hope for more on de-casualisation, &amp; for some sense in shipbuilding industry. More security for men : less demarcation nonsense.

8. I.M. Fund.
