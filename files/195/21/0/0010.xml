C.C.45(62) 10th July 1962

1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter M.R.

a) Laos.

H. Conference : i) means by which L. recognises S.E.A.T.O.

ii) interpretation of L. armies.

iii) w‟drawal of f. troops from Thailand.

Hope these diffies. may be resolved – in 2 wks.

Seems that iii will not be pressed.

b) Congo.

Talks betwn. A. and T. – apparent agreemt. to appoint commns. to go into outstandg. points. But at point of communiqué became apparent they were not agreed on fundamentals – constitn. : fed. structure.

T. unwilling to play until he sees shape of structure more clearly – and wishes to rest m‟while on his de facto autonomy.

Gardiner now has draft constitn. May be tht. discns. can be resumed on basis of a document.

But clear tht. Congo is bankrupt &amp; U.N. will be in Jan ‟63. U. Thant therefore feels soln. must be put thro‟ in next 6 mos. &amp; wants new mandate from U.N. during Aug., while F. Boland is in Chair.

Nervous of S. Council mtg. – extremists may succeed in authorising force. U.N. Commr. said to have plan to fly in 12 battns. etc. – unrealistic.

Trying, with B. &amp; Fr., to find more reliable plan for new initiative.

Remaining ques. : shd. we put economic pressure on T. thro‟ Union Minière. Fr. favour this : U.S. believe it‟s only course. Risk : violent re-action by T. provoking similar response fr. U.N. troops. If Spaak favours this too we shall be alone - &amp; thght to be motivated by support of Katanga lobby &amp; Union Minière. Explorg. idea of putting resources of U.M. (or some of them) into escrow.

Hope to put plan to Cab. Thursday.

2. Parliament.

I.M. Known tht. Brussels talks won‟t end until after House rises. Press assuming therefore tht. Parlt. will be recalled. 25/ix is obvious date.

I wd. therefore prefer to make announcement to-day.

E.H. Posn. not sufficiently clear : we might get outline by end/July.

If it did, we cd. decline debate because not ready.

Statement (esp. on a Tuesday) suggests a crisis.

P.M. If H.G. asks P.Q. I will answer it. Less of a crisis, if left to Oppn. to ask &amp; me to answer.

E.H. Remember tht. qua. negotns. no need to recall Parlt. in Sept. Debate then cd. only be interim. Negotns. still to be completed.

P.M. Keep it all open – can‟t know what we shall want to do, until rest of main negotns. is known.

1. Foreign Affairs (conttd.)

b) Laos.

H. Indians have asked if we will repair engines of their Canberras in Congo. Will this raise same pol. diffies. as supply of bombs.

H.W. They wd. have to come back to U.K.

H. Cd. take time over it : while crisis is on.

D.S. Sure we shd. not refuse this.

[Enter B.C., L.

3. Pensions – Public Service.

H.B. Need to draft Bill – text will go to Legn. Cttee.

Principle : 12% increase for older pensioners, tapering off. Wd. more than cover 9.9% increase in retail price index. But novel addition of flat rate increase of £20 for pensioners over 70. Wd. help Service widows and other hard cases.

Cost : £14 m. on main scheme + £6 m. for over 70 plan.

Para.6. Overseas pensioners. Hardest cases : those where previous employers have not granted pension increases. W. party appointed to go into this. We shall have to act : believe it may cost £1½-2½ m. to U.K. Govt. Hope we can do this by Bill empowering detailed orders to be made.

Effect on incomes policy – para.8.

Excessive pensions – para.9.

First announcement in general terms only because of need to consult l.a.‟s, who wd. have to spend £5 m. p.a. more.

J.B.C. Support – esp. over 70 novelty.

Only doubt is wthr. we shd. mention para. 9 point. We can‟t do anything to abate for those who entered p. service before 1949.

R.A.B. Cdn‟t abate for police, w‟out legn. That wd. be controversial.

H.B. Cdn‟t act without wide consultations – and can‟t start consulting without some initial announcement.

P.M. Let us study this further before anything is said.

On timing : cd. we not get legn. thro‟ in time to come into operation by 1st Jan. or preferably before Xmas?

H.B. Will consider that. Wd. want assurance we can take Bill v. early.

I.M. Agree : have put it in Cab. A.1.

L. Cd. reference to w. party on overseas pensions be included in original announcement.

4. Commercial Policy : Japan.

F.E. Have settled all outstandg. ques. on sensitive list – save wool.

Memo. approved.

[Exit L.

5. Re-sale Price Maintenance.

F.E. As in memo.

S.LI. Ty. &amp; other Ty. Ministers are in favour. I am worried about pol. implicns. ½ m. shopkeepers will be provoked by this.

H.W. Also retail garage trade?

F.E. In food trade it has broken down &amp; been w‟drawn. And bankruptcies have diminished.

Main fields : cars &amp; accessories, pharmaceuticals, sweets, tobacco.

H.W. Need for further study of political balance/advantage.

I.M. I also am impressed by pol. diffies. Opponents wd. be vocal, and supporters silent. No public demand for this.

Wd. also be unpopular in the Party.

M. Oppose this plan – on industrial grounds. Consequences in U.S. v. inconvenient to manufacturers.

E.H. This argument of inconvenience will always be used.

If put into context of expansionist drive, it will be a plus.

Ch.H. Agree. Experience of food trade is helpful : no damage.

Even on pol. side, the silent voters do vote : and younger opinion favours this plan.

J.H. My earlier support is being eroded by short-term political fear.

Wd. do more damage to our image than in-action.

Hail. Effect on commercial morality. Para.15 doesn‟t answer my point : it says merely that he doesn‟t care. With doubts on pol. grounds, I wd. support making it unenforceable. But can‟t accept risk of allowg. retailer to refuse to pay because contract is illegal.

P.M. But enforcement in practice is to w‟hold supplies, not to go to law.

F.E. They also use injunction – wh. they wd. no longer be able to do.

R.A.B. Opposed on pol. grounds : doesn‟t add enough to package.

H.B. Timing is difficult. If Party won‟t take it now, we have only to decide when to do it. It is plainly right.

P.M. Believe this system must come to an end. Feeling in country is v. manufacturer. But there are still 500.000 small shopkeepers, and they will suffer. And they are Tories. Their posn. (&amp; their influence) is being eroded.

H.B. What is F.E. to say on report? It is weak on oversea experience.

Cd. we say we need better informn. on that.

D.E. Large no. of small shops make only small profit. If discount on branded goods goes down they must increase it on other goods.

Politics : the known opponents of this won‟t be enough to re-elect us.

The unknown supporters are much more numerous. Have we lost them? Can‟t we recover them by expansionist p‟mme. If we omit this from that p‟mme Liberals will point to the omission and we shan‟t recover their support.

Hail. For that reason I wd. have gone as far as un-enforceable.

M. We shd. study what is happening in U.S.

P.M. Inclined to prefer just reverting to situation before ‟56 viz. delete the provision in ‟56 Act which strengthened sanctions against individual r.p.m.

(Can‟t act until autumn : don‟t announce now.

(Investigate oversea experience – Europe as well as U.S.

x (Consider wthr. we can remove ‟56 strengthening power to enforce

(indivudal (vice collection) r.p.m. Cd. we run idea of non-(enforceability.

I.M. Worst of both worlds. Doesn‟t relieve anxieties of those who want it.

R.M. More repns. on this than on most other ques.

F.E. No announcement promised. But H/C. know tht. report reached me in Feb last.

Agreed – as at x/. No announcement m‟while.

6. Leonardo Cartoon.

H.B. Crawford. Babington Smith came in to see P.M. &amp; me.

Offer lapses on 31/7 : auction next winter and will fetch 1½-2 m.

R.A. want only £40.000 p.a.

Present sum £375.000. 185.000 contributors of whom only 14.000 identifiable. 115.000 have bought reproductions.

Can‟t keep appeal open beyond 31/7 – i) because adminn. manned by volunteers ii) implied promise to end by 31/7 &amp; some contns. made on that understanding.

They said : if Govt. offered £1. for £1. for remaining £400.000 this wd. not be enough. City is not responding.

Possibility of Govt. paying whole of remainder – or £350.000 to entice remaing. £75.000 from public.

Alternatives: i) Let appeal die : &amp; return the 14.000 contns.

ii) Let Govt. exhibit at a charge to recover cost.

iii) Ask R.A. to let it run for longer.

S.LI. i) wd. damage out reputation.

I favour telling R.A. to give another 6 mos. &amp; give Appeal more adminve. help over 2nd lap. And prs. some Govt. money at end if total not raised.

D.S. Is it right for Govt. to make any large contn.

P.M. Wd. need 12 mos‟ extension. Cdn‟t start again until September.

M. Send it round the big cities?

H.B. Won‟t travel – too fragile.

S.LI. Only £17.000 has come from collectg. boxes.

I.M. If we start another lap, we appear to be under-writing eventual payment : thereby discourage further contribns.

H. We cd. start 2nd lap by putting up £50.000 or so.

P.M. Put up £200.000 &amp; make public raise the rest.

R.A. giving another six months.

I will first see R.A. Then report back.

7. Committees of Enquiry.

H.B. Suggest Ministers shd. think twice before appointing Cttees.

P.M. Let Minister inform Chancellor/Exchequer : &amp; if any dispute refer to P.M.

8. Office Building in London.

S.LI. Let H.B.‟s new Cttee. assume this responsibility.
