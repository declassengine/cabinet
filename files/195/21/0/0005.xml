C.C.39(62) 31st May 1962

1. Parliament. [Enter M.R.

I.M. Business for next week.

C.Market debate : 2 days : L.P.S. to open. Wed/Thurs.

P.M. to settle other speakers.

2. Economic Situation.

S.LI. Sp. deposits to revert to 2% today. B/E. will also give advice on credits – incldg. restraint on bldg. in areas where labour etc. is short.

H.p. deposits. We were pressed to give more flexibility esp. for consumer durables. Cdn‟t do this earlier. Now tht. credit is being eased, we cd. safely move – not on cars, but on refrigerators and some others. Present as adjustment to give greater flexibility. Timing : sooner the better.

Propose B/T. announcement on Mon. next.

R.M. Hope we shan‟t move back.

S.H. No : believe this can be permanent at 10%.

R.M. Then avoid relating it to passing phase – eg. clearing stocks.

M. Hope this will be treated as permanent. Bad for industry to keep changing h.p. rates.

Agreed : H.P. announcement Monday.

[Enter Att.G., J. Hope. Grant

3. Trafalgar Square : Meeting of N. Socialist Movement.

K. Concln. of mtg. of Ministers – as in submission to P.M.

Att.G. advises no sufft. evidence for b.o. procedure.

Hail. The man was respons. for N.Hill riots and has twice bn. convicted of insulting behaviour.

Att.G. But he has addressed 2 earlier mtgs. in Traf. Square w‟out serious incident. [No knowledge of] Aware of his pre. cons. but they wdn‟t outweigh past record in T. Square.

R.A.B. H.O. support M/W. view. If you disallow this mtg. you will have to launch a general policy for suppressing anti. Semitic speeches etc.

Agreed – as proposed by K.

E.H. Try to persuade those who have raised the issue to treat it with

contempt &amp; not to stage counter demonstrations.

Agreed – Att.G. to speak to Weilzman.

J.H. to speak to Lady R. &amp; Janner.

[Exit J.H.

4. Burma : War Damage Claim.

K. As in memo.

Att.G. No merit in claim : our duty to tell plaintiffs we won‟t pay. In better posn. to legislate, if we have to do so, if we have given notice in advance.

Better that Ty. Solr. shd. write via Ld. Advocate, who is a party.

I.M. Not v. fair to say we shall change the rules to ensure we shall win.

Is there not a safe chance tht. plaintiffs wd. lose?

Att.G. Can‟t be sure. If we are clear tht. taxpayer shd. not pay, we shd. put it beyond doubt. A judgement wd. give them vested right to damages.

W.G. If it went on, it wd. go to H/Lds.

Agreed : Ty. Att.G., Ld. Adv. to consider who (other than

(Ld. Adv.) shd. write the letter.

[Exit Att.G., W.G.

5. S.E.A.T.O. : Laos.

H. Communists have advanced 100 km. from north, by-passing towns and at one point are near Mekong R. They might go into Thailand – at one point no Thais &amp; liable to be claimed for Laos.

Phonma going back to Paris on 14/6 &amp; will stay there unless a natl. Govt. has bn. formed m‟while. Asking U.S. to put maximum pressure on Phonmi. If he stands out, we shall face choice of partitioning Laos or moving mil. opns. over Mekong. King won‟t see Phonma before 4/6.

If we cd. get the national Govt. it wd. hold – prs. for some years.

R.A.B. Further discn. in Cab. before any statement in Parliament.

6. Federation of Nyasaland and Rhodesia.

R.A.B. Wd. like to state main points –

i) No certainty of agreement – mustn‟t be optimistic. But R.W. is

ready to consider change : sees tht. existg. Fedn. can‟t go on w‟out

change.

ii) S.Rhodesia. More diff. than appears. Delayed election.

Pressure fr. U.N., wh. encourages African leaders. Serious economic crisis because of over-spending eg. on African education. Risk of unemployment &amp; pol. tension. Whitehead may not win : if he doesn‟t, Field wd. favour secession.

iii) Nyasaland. Malawi Ministers v. rude. I resist on secession.

Delaying it by investigation into means &amp; econ. consequences.

Banda will be here in July : will demand pol. change in constitution and this mght appeal to Europeans. Independence must be delayed because of effects in other 2 territories.

R.W. has agreed tht. N. must be treated as separate problem.

iv) N.Rhodesia. Election in Oct. Kaunda didn‟t impress.

Won‟t be only Afr. leader to emerge in election. Must wait for that

before taking further constitl. steps.

Over next few months preparatory work by Commrs. on i) separation

of N. ii) new assocn. betwn. the Rhodesians. Tho‟ R.W. has now indicated readiness to continue financial assistance to N.

R.W. has said pulicly he accepts my plan &amp; advisers. He doesn‟t want a purely economic assocn. : wants some pol. content.

K. Congratulations. Better atmosphere. People ready to discuss, &amp; that is an advance.

D.S. Foundation for calmer discussion.

Believe myself it won‟t be poss. to forge a pol. link between N. and S. Rhodesia. The foreign pol. ques. are explosive betwn. black &amp; white.

Future of S.Rhodesia is crucial. If independent (&amp; opposed) they will be knocked about in U.N. etc.

R.A.B. Must try to work twds. assocn. with some pol. content.

H. Agree.

7. Shipping.

a) Cunard.

E.M. Loss this year £1¾ m. is being announced and explained on Mon.

Freight will show profit for 1962. Express net loss of £613.000.

Trend is clear. Causes : big jet aircraft and increased wages cost. Competitors are subsidised on operating as well as capital costs.

Financial advisers urge them to discontinue these services quickly.

b) Reina del Mar

This co. is askg. for £300.000.

Arguments pro &amp; con subsidy summarised in memo.

£7 m. in dollars earned by Queens in „59/‟60. Benefit to b/p.

But how avoid extendg subsidy to other lines. The claim has bn. lodged in respect of b). This is only first of a succession of diffies. for passenger liners.

Any help to passenger shipping wd. be better given in other ways – eg. standard ships : Govt. yard with no restrictive practices.

Subsidy for Cunard wd. be £400.000 p.a. on each ship.

P.T. Aviation project will have little impact on E.M.‟s Cunard problem.

Present project – as in memo. 20-25% of shares wd. be held by Cunard. Good arguments in favour. If they are to be in this, better together than separate. They are both in a mess financially : but worse if they compete v. one another as well as v. other air lines. Commercial concln. betwn. them is likely to be reached next week. M. Dpt. and Ty. will have to go into the financial detail.

H.B. Against subsidy to Cunard. No b/p case for it.

E.M.‟s final recommn. is doubtful : we shd. express no hopes – wd. imply some readiness to help some day. Also against linking this with air project.

Announcement 4/6 wd. be premature if it is to reflect any Govt. support.

V. big money involved – B.O.A.C. deficit is £60 m.

P.T. Announcement can be deferred for a week.

J.H. There is a political link between shipping &amp; aircraft project.

J.M. Yes : don‟t underestimate shock of shipping announcement.

All our liner cos. are facing subsidised competition; and those who wanted to go into air were prevented by monopoly condns.

Even with most modern ships P. &amp; O. and Orient are beginning to see same diffies. as Cunard.

M. We cd. not deal with 2 cos. in isolation. All our lines are in same posn. – large reserves but no operating profits. We shall have to look at industry as a whole.

Cunard announcement won‟t refer to subsidy.

B.O.A.C./Cunard project ought to be encouraged.

P.T. I wd. prefer to p‟pone announcement, if possible, until our own attitude is plain. Timing to be considered by M/A. &amp; Ty.

R.A.B. 1. Reject shipping subsidies.

Encourage B.O.A.C./Cunard project.

D.E. France and U.S. will pick up the traffic. This will be a blow to

x/ leading maritime nation. Must be v. serious unless it can be accompanied by firm statement of the preferred alternatives –

i) cargo vessels will be ordered ii) action on docks iii) Ldn. hotels for tourists arriving by air. iv) will to remain a leader in air services.

H. Agree : we need a coherent policy for future : and we shd. be ready to explain it. When?

E.M. Cunard won‟t announce w‟drawal of Queens from Atlantic run.

P.T. 2. If Ty. and M/A. agree on detail, timing and nature of announcement can be settled by them. Agreed.

R.A.B. Agree : 1 and 2 now.

M/T. to come fwd. as soon as poss. with proposals for presentation of x/.

8. Cotton.

F.E. As in memo.

Accept offer of H.Kong and India to keep to existg. levels for another 3 years. Get Pakistan to conform.

But loss of confidence in industry is still a factor. Wish therefore to w‟draw open genl. licence &amp; put on open individual licence – so tht. we know more quickly of new import threats. Change of policy which is justifiable in present circs. Statement Tues. next in terms of draft annexed.

D.S. Accept this on assumptn. tht. agreement of Pakistan is secured.

M. &amp; I.M. Delete final para. of statement – or at least penultimate sentence.

Agreed : omit from final para last 2 sentences.

H.B. Effect on countries overseas.

H. Support this point.

L.P.S. to consult F.E. on effects on Brussels.

F.E. to consult I.M. on timing of announcement.

9. Tourism.

Mtg. of Junior Ministers of Dpts. concerned.
