C.C.33(62) 15th May 1962
1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter M.R.
a) Laos.
H. P. Lao are now w‟in 30 m. of Thai frontier; and, if they exploited this sitn. they cd. quickly seize all of N. Laos and move up to Mekong river.
U.S. decided therefore to put troops in : re-inforcing 2.000 already there up to 5 or 6.000 : not diff. to move them up to Mekong. At same time renewed dipl. pressure to bring national Govt. into being. Phonma returning from Paris : hope Phonmi will return from Formosa.
Latter now willing tht. p‟folios of defence and interior shd. go to central figures. Same hope now that peaceful soln. may be renewed – tho‟ Phonmi will now be yielding to Communist pressure. A new man now emerging – Phoni.
U.S. Forces bi-laterally with Thais, in deliberate attempt to avert an appeal to S.E.A.T.O.
P.M. See that Australia is informed fully. H. to see Harrison.
Try to persuade them to continue to leave S.E.A.T.O. out.
H. Mr. K. is still unwilling to put U.S. forces into Laos.
But he is asking for „representational‟ S.E.A.T.O. forces in Thailand.
Thais may be prompted to ask for return of Cobra forces.
This needs consideration.
2. Oversea Aid : Egypt.
S.Ll. E. are in trouble : 60/70 m. short, in spite of aid from Bank and U.S.
They suggest we, Germans and Italians shd. produce balance, to enable them to refrain from going to Soviet bloc.
If we don‟t respond, they will be awkward on our claims. Can we make it conditional on completion of Financial Agreement? If we lent $10 m., up to $8 m. wd. come to our people.
If we give anything, Greece, Turkey and Iran will expect more from
us.
Problems for us : i) our home opinion and 2 considns. noted above.
H. Fawzi told me they intended to reduce dependence on East. This cd. be turning point in our relations with E. How much free money.
Loan of 12 m., with 4 m. free, wd. be more attractive to them.
Method : credit, to be drawn on only as they clear old obligations.
Admit repercussions on G. T. and I. – tho‟ perhaps some time lag.
My view : $12 m. conditional on old obligns. and any free money tied to Br. goods.
E.H. 1.100 cases outstanding on deseguestration. But B. subjects are still in diffy. in getting sums transferred out of E.
D.S. Effect on aid ceiling? Sound C‟wealth claims. Unfortunate if f. countries alone are allowed to exceed ceiling.
E.H. C‟wealth demands are already so great tht. there is virtually no room, w‟in ceiling, for any aid to f. countries.
Hail. It‟s their economic policy tht. has brought them to bankruptcy.
What prospect of their becoming solvent? They have sold cotton crop to East in exchange for arms.
S.Ll. Crisis is due to loss of ⅓rd. of last year‟s cotton crop. They are now devaluing and enforcing remedial measures demanded by Fund.
R.M. But they continue to give money to Africans who are making diffies. for us – and m‟taining radio propaganda in M/E.
F.E. x/. They have large unspent credit here for trade : £20 m.
Are they taking Canal dues sufficiently into a/c.
M. Commercial prize is high. The credit is 5% interests : why shdn‟t they go for loan at lower figure.
I.M. A main objection of E. policy is to undermine our posn. in Aden and Africa. Why shd. we provide them with money to do this with. Cdn‟t justify loan w‟out assurance tht. this propaganda shd. cease,.
Hail. On our claim, it might be cheaper to pay them off ourselves.
D.E. We cd. spend the money to better effect elsewhere : e.g. on educn. in N. Nigeria instead of letting E. teachers filter in.
H. Object is political : to draw E. away from Soviet bloc.
The Bank are ready to form consortium for long term if E. pay off existg. obligns. There are inducements here to better behaviour.
J.H. Cd. we give them $8 m (to pay our claimants) and say they mght get some more if their policy in M/E. and Africa is in fact changed.
Why not stress x/ : compared with which tied loan of $2 m. over the $8 m. is derisory.
H.W. Support F.O. E. are helping us over Kassim.
R.M. We cdn‟t justify this in view of x/. and behaviour in Africa and M/E.
D.S. Surely not w‟out some outward sign of changed policy.
Performance before pay.
S.Ll. I cd. ask them about the £20 m. and enquire about propaganda etc.
P.M. Wd. H/C. accept this? Suez etc.
M.R. Will be helped because of balancing feeling in favour of our claimants.
P.M. Presentation. Can we disclose this, wh. wd. help us. It wd. be embarrassing to E. There will have to be agreed formula. The additional money will be harder to defend: pol. act favouring E. Why shd. we do this? There must be some outward sign of new spirit of friendship. If we are to do a political act, they must do one too. Can‟t we put that to E. Govt.?
Agreed : draw up plan and instructions on basis of $5 m. to pay off obligations and offer of $2 m. or 4m. more against better behaviour.
F.O. &amp; Ty. to submit to later Cabinet.
3. Incomes Policy.
S.Ll. Employers at earlier stages said they wd. give way either on wages or on hours but not on both. They conceded both. They then said they were thinking of increase of 2d. Mtg. with P.M. on Saty. – agreed no intervention : assumed they wd. strike.
J.H The 2d. was mentioned secretly to Cousins. He didn‟t tell his people but asked them to agree to 1 week‟s delay. He was out-voted.
At 3 p.m. on Saty. employers told me that they wd. go to 4d. and bring hours concession back to Oct. I warned them of consequences on incomes policy. T.U.‟s came to M/L. asking if employers would talk.
Unfortunate they had to meet in M/L. After 8 hrs. or so of talk employers went to 1/6d. and hours adjustment back to August.
They tried, in announcement, to get it away from incomes policy.
S.Ll. In general we must adhere to our policy. Breaches of it make it all the more important to m‟tain it.
P.M. Can we bring out increases given by Press to their own employers – 10% all round w‟out announcement.
Hail. Will it help us to bring out yet another breach?
H.B. I am in favour of expressing disapproval of breaches – in order to help other employers to stand firm.
M. Is it good timing – to add Press to docks?
H.B. Agree it‟s too late now.
H.W. Those whose wages we control are lower middle class. Can we continue, politically, to hold these down while T.U.‟s and the rich get
away with it.
I.M. This political consideration seems to me to be decisive.
Don‟t believe employers will honour our policy.
We shall have to review whole thing and see wthr. we can put teeth into it.
Hail. We can‟t defend posn. in which least deserving claims are those which succeed. Especially bad tht. docks concessions shd. have bn. made in M/L. building by employers who are largely public corpns.
Univ. teachers. Our case was tht. action taken was necessary to hold private sector. But we aren‟t holding private sector.
H.B. We must first consider wthr. and how we can influence private employers. Doubt if strictness in public sector does influence them. What other weapons have we got or can we forge?
D.S. Agree : not a ques. of abandoning incomes policy : problem is to find means of enforcing it in private sector.
R.M. This discussion under estimates effects achieved by the policy.
H.W. Must have a different one for next phase. Can we not discuss in Cab., as well as Wages Cttee.?
J.M. Agree : we can‟t stand on flat 2½%. We must find means of differentiating according to need.
P.T. Agree with I.M. We face collapse of policy unless we can find teeth for it. Need memo. by S.Ll., after discn. in E.P.C.
S.Ll. Need decision by end/month. Some arbitration cases are coming forward now. C. Service next week.
D.E. Right to have a policy and for Govt. to show example. But it won‟t be followed until private sector is convinced of its validity. Moreover, must have a system of re-valuation for groups left behind. Employers haven‟t understood that growth depends on such a policy (general).
P.M. x/ Cd. we see (M/L). What has happened since July ‟61 on wages and what mght have happened w‟out an incomes pause.
Are we saying it‟s impossible to run free society under democracy?
In some industries loss thro‟ strike outweighs damage of increased wages – cf. newspapers.
In others, varying interests : some cd. stand it, others cdn‟t – cf. docks.
In others again employers handle claims unskilfully.
The facts are not uniform thro‟ industry.
We have at least gained time. In full emplt. always will be some inflation. We have delayed spiral – in reln. to competitors overseas.
y/ Can we also see comparative table of European inflation since July ‟61 – to see wthr. we have dropped out of the lead.
In July we had to show example in public sector. Can we continue to treat them more harshly than others?
N.E.D.C. mustn‟t be hurried. But as they have set target of 4% growth, what follows in respect of wages. What does their maximum growth rate imply for incomes? It is recognised as ambitious aim. Cd.
z/ we mount on it a new appeal on incomes?
I.M. We know tht. pause has strengthened our competitive position with Germany. We haven‟t much time. Feeling in H/C. is rising. People want to be told soon what our policy will be for next phase.
Hail. Agree : sitn. is deteriorating fast.
[Exit Home.
4. Re-sale Price Maintenance.
Hail. Division of opinion in E.P.C. – a minority thinking this to be of no advantage politically or economically.
This is essentially a matter of contract extended in 1956 to 3rd parties having notice of the contract. Proposal now wd. be to abolish that extension and reverse the common law posn. tht. contract term is enforceable between original parties.
This to correct phrase word in pp. referring to prohibition.
F.E. None of half way houses will do. We shd. do all of nothing. I favour all.
[Exit S.LI.
Young Tories are v. it. Labour are v. it subject to exemptions.
Trade Cttee. of Party wd. prefer to see it wither away. It won‟t.
Liberals are v. it.
Abolition wd. cause storm from small shopkeepers, but they are only 50% of retail trade.
Consumers – largely uninterested. But growing publicity for extent to which it increases prices.
H.B. Economic case for abolition is overwhelming. Positive contn. by Govt. to growth.
Politically awkward, esp. on timing. Announcemt. will be followed by 12 mos. delay or more in implementation. Wd. prefer to delay announcement until we can be ready to act.
In U.S. there is difft. law prohibiting differential [Exit R.M.
prices wh. can‟t be justified by costs. Shd. we not need somethg. like this – because of high discounts which can be obtained by large retailers. This needs consideration.
M. I‟m entirely against this. Unfair competition. Hard on small retailers. Competn. betwn. manufacturers of similar goods is enough to keep prices down.
I.M. Doubt if p‟mme is practicable. Little room for legn. This wd. have to compete with consumers protn. and other Bills which are more popular for next session.
We can‟t take on now a row with small retailers and Chambers (Commerce).
J.M. Support M. – can‟t estimate consequences : eg. after sale service etc.
P.M. P‟pone. No point in announcg. intention which you can‟t fulfil. Wait until ready to legislate.
P.T. Consider dealing only with extension to 3rd parties
(Hail‟s point.)
H.B. S.Ll. may wish to submit memo. on economic consequences of r.p. no. in drawing excessive nos. into distribution.
J.H. Many of additional workers are m. women not drawn out of productive industry.
5. National Theatre.
