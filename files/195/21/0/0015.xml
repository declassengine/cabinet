C.C.50(62) 27th July 1962

1. Leonardo Cartoon. [Enter M.R.

B.C. Maximum contn. from H.M.G. is £350.000. Alternative is in memo.

N. Gallery will be v. reluctant to charge.

Enquiry by Reviewing Cttee.

P.M. Don‟t announce Cttee. enquiry at same time : wd. take some gilt off the gingerbread.

R.M. We shall be asked how we prevent this occurring again.

P.M. Let us have this considered – but quietly, without announcing it.

Agreed : R.M. to announce in reply to P.Q. 31/vii

2. Foreign Affairs.

a) Congo.

H. U.S., U.K., Fr., Belg. agreed to do all possible to prevent Sec. Co. mtg.

We cdn‟t support resoln. invoking econ. sanctions because only ones open wd. have to be policed by U.N. force. Also precedent for U.N. to use against S. Africa, Portugal – and ourselves (over Rhodesia).

But if we had to dissociate ourselves, shd. we veto. Swinton thinks we shd.

M‟while, less likely tht. Sec. Co. will meet.

If it does - i) shd. we veto a resoln. invoking sanctions?

ii) shd. we table more moderate resoln. favouring federal constn., division of revenues, internatl. plan for re-construction &amp; development. Some support from our Allies : but U.S. want U.N. to impose the plan (&amp; also give A.‟s armies right to roam over Katanga) or failing that to impose it themselves. Recommend we table this, if need arises, with support of as many of our friends as we can.

iii) can we make A. &amp; T. come together. Waterhouse (Union Miniere) says no pressures will affect T. : who wd. sooner starve than give way to U.N. (or U.S.) operation.

Therefore : hope for no mtg. : if there is one act at (ii) : insist any attempt to impose intrnatl. plan, continue pressures on T. (e.g. via Welensky) to co-operate espec. over finance.

P.T. Diff. to decide in advance tht. we wd. use veto. Cab. mght have to meet to consider in light of circs. at the time. But U.S. mght be warned we may have to do it.

Hail. Veto wd. only mean transfer to Assembly, where we wd. be beaten more decisively.

H. Yes : &amp; F.O. wd. prefer to dissociate. But qua home opinion veto is clearer position.

P.M. Real ques. : shd. we continue to pay?

H. We shd. have to continue special contn. but we cd. hardly buy the Bonds.

D. Agree with P.T. – wait for circs.

R.A.B. Strong reaction in Fedn. if sanctions applied &amp; force use.

R.W. – will be flattered to be asked, but more excitable than we wd. wish.

R.M. Doubtful if any advantage in having veto. Internatl. embarrassment wd. outweigh pol. convenience here.

D.S. No advantage if it isn‟t going to be effective.

J.H. Agree.

E.B. So do I.

K.J. Does dissociation have any effect – none in Congo, I presume : &amp; doesn‟t enable us to stop paying.

H. We can‟t stop U.N. action anyhow.

R.A.B. Wd. dissociation be strong enough for our Party?

R.M. Get them to understand more clearly tht. veto is no longer effective.

I.M. I wd. be against veto because ineffective. It wd. lose us our influence with moderate Afro. Asians. It wd. encourage extreme opponents of U.N. in Party to press even up to w‟drawal from U.N.

H. Look to future : if U.N. sought to apply sanctions to S.A., we might have to use veto.

Will D. look at legal posn. – on powers of Assembly – in light of judgement by Internatl. Court.

P.M. iii) On sanctions resoln., we shd. dissociate – explaining tht. veto is ineffective.

iv) If it were passed, consider our support : we shd. Not supply arms or bombs : consider purchase of Bonds : contn. to operation cd. wait until Ct. decision has gone to Assembly.

ii) Put forward resoln. as at (ii).

i) Work for having no Sec. Council discussion.

H. Main diffce. between U.S. and us is U.S. judgement that if [Exit D.S.)

force applied to T., he wd. collapse. Our judgement : he

will fight thro‟ guerrillas.

b) Berlin.

H. Mtgs. with Grom. – also 4 W. Powers.

Gr. interested only in end of occupn. &amp; w‟drawal of troops.

x/ Unless these included no agreement possible &amp; R. wd. conclude Treaty with E. Germans.

I invited him to consider other matters : approach problem round its edges : said we wd. never give W. Germans independent control of n. weapons : wd. consider N.A.T.O./Warsaw pact etc. He then repeated x/. I said I cdn‟t x help him out of his diffty. it he stuck to this (x as we had over Laos Tests).

Believe Gr. is willing to go on jawing. Agreed with Rusk to resume in W‟ton. Doubt if they will sign Treaty soon : no signs of approach to other signatories.

In E. Germany they have had to ration butter &amp; meat. R. may be reluctant to hand over control to Ulbricht.

But for C.M. discns. there are things we cd. offer – R. contingents on

y/ war memorial : internatl. control of access. Wd. like to be able to inject some of these positive ideas into U.S./R. discns., as soon as this is safe for Brussels negotns.

But this wd. be long shot : more likely tht. twds. end of year R. will conclude the treaty with E. Germany.

W. German politics v. insecure at present. They wd. be easily upset.

Credit : £300 m (?) W. Germany will supply gradually, to get more influence over E. Germans.

P.M. Moscow Tel. 1381. Expects preliminary move twds. treaty after end Aug. But these wd. be known to us.

Better therefore to review in Aug. wthr. we shd. put y/ into discns. because if we do, they will get back to Adenauer.

[Exit M.N.

c) Nuclear Tests. [Exit R.A.B.

H. U.S. are about to put new proposal on control to Disarmament Conference.

Will be v. near proposal of 8 neutrals. V. small element of on-site inspn. for R. Fear R. will reject even this.

U.S. scientists now content with 23 stations + v small on site verification – tho‟ Congress wd. never agree tht. inspn. be only at invitation.

P.M. Still believe we cd. chance our arm : for only tests that matter are in the atmosphere. But we cd. only get that sort of agreement as part of a wider détente.

d) Laos.

H. Great change of atmosphere as cpd. with 14 mos. ago – at this Geneva Confce. Due largely to M. Macdonald. Realise we are willing to accept neutralisation in S.E.A. Even Americans have appeared to be more sympathetic.

P.M. Better than U.N. Small company. Calmer atmosphere. More understanding naturally.

H. Also because they have had a job to do.

Seek another area of possible agreement, where Deputies cd. seek a solution.
