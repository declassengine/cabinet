C.C.44(62) 5th July 1962

1. Parliament. [Enter R.M.

I.M. Business for next week. H/C.

Hail. H/L. Debate on Pilkington. Morrison‟s motion draws attentn. to Rpt.

Ought now to have Govt. motion approveg. W. Paper : but then there wd. be division which we shd. not win. On Morrison‟s motion there wd. be no division.

R.A.B. Wd. prefer to have approval of W. Paper. Agreed.

2. Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

R.A.B. Talks with Banda ended in acceptce. of Cab. conclns. Const. Confce. in Nov. after N.R. elections.

His Press conference y‟day is not even reported. He has left.

He wants statement on accession in autumn. I said not until my advisers have reported.

Mtg. was friendly.

3. Foreign Affairs.

a) Algeria.

Prov. Executive becomes Prov. Govt. Earlier govt., in Tunisia

has moved in to A. likely to merge with the other. We are w‟holdg. recognn. m‟while. Sov. Govt. have recognised Ben Keddar. He is likely to emerge as Head of merged Govt. Our delay in recognition is acceptable to Fr. Govt.

b) Laos.

Confce. procdg. incldg. Thais. Problems i) S.E.A.T.O. ii) Integration of mil. forces. Govt. claiming this is internal matter.

c) British Guiana.

R.M. Commn. report won‟t be available &amp; will show Jagan in v. bad light.

J. may ask U.N. to send Cttee of 17 for special investign. Hope U.S. will support us in resisting this.

E.H. Will spk. U. Thant on this.

4. Europe : C. Market.

E.H. Tough &amp; intensive mtg. Procedure more flexible : but Six took more

of the time than we - because of diffce. among themselves. Fr. spoke much in Six &amp; not at all in Seven.

Asian countries : wanted to leave this open until Desai here.

But Fr. put reservation on whole plan because pressure fr. their textile lobby. Subject therefore deferred until next mtg.

Two agric. ques. : we were ready but Six were not. I arranged for sp. addl. mtg. 18-20/7.

Nil tariffs : Six not ready on major items – alum., lead, zinc.

Temperate goods : 3 long sessions : issues clarified : transitional period to ‟70 accepted – &amp; recognised tht., failing world agreement, somethg. else must follow. Agreed also tht. (save for wheat) Community preference shd. extend to C‟wealth. Agreed to negotiate with old C‟wealth countries to give elements wh. wd. be incorporated in a world agreement. Moving twds. a clear position.

Association : Six have defined terms incldg. no veto by existg. associates &amp; same condns. for old and new. But they are trying to say we can‟t know about our associates until we are in. I am working for informal negotns. thro‟ dipl. channels. Diffy. is Fr. allergy to Ghana; &amp; anxiety about C.A. Fedn. among existg. associates.

Must handle this gradually.

Euratom Statement went well. Corrected D. Exp. impression

we shd. be giving away secret know-how : wd. be done on basis of patents (? royalties).

I.M. Dramatic and serious slip of opinion in country – against C. Market.

Has bn. going on for some time. B‟brook Press &amp; even most Farming Express. Wd. therefore be v. serious if no decn. reached before H/C. rises – drift wd. continue : can‟t reverse it w‟out hard facts.

E.H. This has made no impact yet on negotns.

Mtg. will continue after 28/7 – prs. until 10 or 14 Aug.

Five of Six are anxious to get concln. in time for P.M.M.

R.A.B. President N.F.U. is coming out this weekend with genl. statement opposing C. Market.

C.S. He assumes we get no success in securg. concessions in negotns.

H.B. Cd. we at least get some non-political figure to say there is no substance in suggn. tht. R.C. President of U.S. is pushing us into R.C. dominated Community.

K. Prs. I cd. say somethg. publicly before Recess on “sovereignty” – on basis of Sol. Genl. Ctte‟s report, now in draft.

M. Organised labour are beginning to come out v. C. Market – N.U.R. already. Will come to a head at T.U.C. in August.

D.E. There is somethg. in H.B.‟s point. Petition from dissenters in my constituency. Uneasiness in country over increase in R.C. populn. shows itself over education. Anti. R.C. feeling in Chapel belt (route of Wesley‟s journeys).

Express campaign is now turning from condns. to attack on joining under any condns. Wd. be useful if we cd. begin to show advantages – before public become opposed in principle.

I.M. Publicity must be defensive until result of negotns. is known.

J.H. Cd. do more : farmers receptive to argument tht. our system must change.

P.M. We must struggle through the next 5 weeks.

5. Kenya.

R.M. Landless Africans – dangerous volcano. Many Europeans ready to sell farms.

Hence scheme for taking 1 m. acres for re-settlement.

Standard of farming will drop. Emplt. opportunities small because of no. of Africans already employed on Eur. farms. But w‟out this collapse – if Europeans abandon farms &amp; tribes fight over them.

Announcement in Keneya : para.6.

H.B. Much constructive discn. C.O./Ty. officials – to make best practicable scheme. We must do somethg. Plan evolved is improvement on all earlier ones.

I wd. support it – subject to i) no announcemt. w‟out concurrence of K. Govt. : must not appear to be U.K. scheme imposed on them.

ii) cost £12½ m. in addn. to other expre. on Kenya. Must mean less for development in future.

iii) must be scheme for settlement of Africans not rescue of Eurpeans.

R.M. Accept these conditions. This must be 1st charge on sum available for development.

D.S. Accept this : but won‟t be able to resist compensation demands from other Eur. farmers.

R.M. This shd. cover all the hard cases.

And may help to give confidence twds. recreatg. market in land.

R.A.B. Will cause stiff re-action in S.R. – for which I have not yet got authy. for aid.

Approved.

6. Malaysia.

P.M. Seek Cab. approval to our trying to bring this off. V. gt. diffies. if we don‟t – over Singapore. If we do, large relief in I.S. oblign. in S.

Only problem is transitional stage in Borneo territories.

Tunku‟s message – based on assumptn. tht. views of Br. members of Commn. are views of U.K. Govt. Have urged him to come - on basis tht. all is open to discussion.

Worst posn. of all wd. be for us to remain responsible in some degree for interests of a part of the Fedn. Don‟t let us make same mistake

as we did over N.R. &amp; Nyasaland. W‟hall must not remain responsible. Hope Cab. will accept that view.

R.M. Immensely important (because of Singapore) to get this through.

Diffy. is tht. Borneo peoples aren‟t capable of self-Govt. but shrewd enough to dislike being governed by Malays. And we have given some assurances. Won‟t therefore be easy to get transitional plan wh. is defensible.

P.M. Beware of Indonesian claim – esp. if they get W. Irian. Another reason for speed.

R.M. If Tunku doesn‟t come, reason will be cold feet over whole project.

K. Must have bn. similar problems in Penang &amp; Malacca, when they were included in Malaya.

Memo. approved in principle.

7. Economic Situation.

S.LI. Discussion on 28/6. Not recommending it then : but may be Exports growing “satisfactorily”. I wdn‟t be “satisfied” necessary later.

K. But I suppose we can continue to say tht. they (exports) have improved.

S.LI. Note with satisfaction engineering wages settlement.

8. Coal. [Enter R,W., Craigton

Short-term problem.

R.W. N.C.B. meeting Unions 10/7 : statement will come out 11/7 : Govt.

statement must be ready by then. Morning Press on 12/7.

I.M. By-election : Leicester.

R.W. Statement wd. include many positive steps by Govt.

H.B. This draft is too long : also too much coal economics &amp; not enough human problem stuff. Here we can say we are looking far ahead to a situation which won‟t mature for some time &amp; we are taking steps well in advance to deal with it.

P.M. Yes : fr. human angle 4.000 to be handled – say how. From economic angle : loss in emplt. opportunities, for which we are planning to provide alternatives.

H.B. Toothill was on these lines - &amp; was well received viz., Scotland shd. stop propping up dying industries &amp; attract growing ones.

No need for us to be so much on the defensive.

D.E. Problems to come in N.E. &amp; in Wales. Is it wise to go off with such a bang in Scotland.

P.M. Begin with propn. of shrinking coal mining. Nos. of men already placed in other work. Next instalment: Scotland. Time to plan for it : this is how we shall meet. Tone it all down.

M. Some mention of transport – also cause of anxiety in Scotland.

C. Hard for S. &amp; S. to take that on board tho.

P.M. H.B., with R.W., J.M. and (on some points) F.E.

to recast statement in light of discussion &amp;

submit revised draft to P.M.

Long-term problem.

S.LI. Conclns. of E.A.(62)81.

P.M. Whence will heavy industry in Scotland draw its fuel? Shall we be asked to allow import of U.S. coal.

R.W. No : if efficient collieries are freed fr. burden of losses.(?)

P.M. Reluctant to endorse (i) – v. general.

H.B. N.C.B. have a 5 year plan to avoid shipping into deficit.

C. Want N.C.B. to pay regard to social implications, esp. on timing.

R.W. They will take care over that. But remember their prodn. (demand)

estimate is optimistic : and this closure p‟mme is a minimum.

P.M. Approve (i) on understanding tht. plan will be carried out in close consultn. with Dpts. concerned with its social implications.

And make it apply not to (i), but to the plan itself.

R.W. Para (ii) is target for coal – corresp. to that already fixed for other natd. indies.

H.B. This is Board‟s own choice, not ours. It is based on a production of 190 m. tons.

P.M. Prodn. target shd. also be included, as well as money – esp. to meet views of miners.

R.W. May be unwise to announce prodn. target in H/C.

Would be interpreted as Govt. guarantee.

P.M. V. well – tho‟ may be pressed in debate.

R.W. Para.(v) is to enable Bd. to borrow temporarily to meet a dedicit.

C.S. In presentation put (ii) before (i).

R.W. Yes.

R.W. How shd. I make the statement? Long for end/Ques. Cd. then be a debate?

I.M. No Govt. time for it. But one day, at choice of Opposn.

E.H. Para.(iv). U.S. have said this is contrary to G.A.T.T. We shall say we can re consider in a years‟ time.
