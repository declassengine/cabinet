C.C.51(62) 31st July 1962

1. Europe : Common Market. [Enter M.R.

E.H. Temperate foods – almost wholly old Doms. V. difft. because affects producers in Europe. We began by asking for comparable outlets, w‟out time limit. Asked to be more specific, we gave quantities for Six as a whole : v. large. We considered tht. these mght apply to ‟70 then be turned into system appropte. to condns. at that time. Six wd. not accept this in reln. to Six as a whole because Doms. no difft. from other 3rd countries. We therefore fell back on demand for comparable outlet in U.K. market. Six have now said they can‟t accept any quantitative arrangemt,. because agric policy in Six is moving away fr. quantitative arrangemts. Real reason : Fr. desire w‟in Six to remove G.‟s quantitative arrangemts. so as to reduce price &amp; open G. to Fr. agric. exports : this is cardinal to France, and brkg. point for French. Fr. thesis, supported by rest of Six, is tht. only sound basis is to go for world commodity agreements. to deal with emerging emphasis. We have accepted this &amp; agreed on dates and subjects (‟63) : we must ensure tht. it deals with access for exporters – wh. Six haven‟t yet accepted. Six : Transitional arrangemts. to ‟70 : world agreements shd. be concluded before then. But what happens if this not realised? Six propose trade agreemts. with countries wh. wd. have bn. ready to gain world agreemt.

Further point : price policy of Six generally. They believe tht. price

x/ cd. secure reasonable access. Key to whole system. Stated their

intention of defining their policy and pursuing a reasonable policy, if we enter : &amp; claims worthy of such an intentn. Quantve. restns. : allowed under Art.21 (intended to apply only to Sov. bloc and we have assurance to this effect); Art.22 – grave disturbances in market (seeking assurance this wdn‟t apply to C‟wealth w‟in traditional amounts : diff. to insist : have offd assurance only in extreme circs,. &amp; tht. interests of tradl. suppliers will be taken into a/c.)

Transitional period. Preferential and non pref. : diff. systems. There is intra-Six pref system up to ‟70. Explained it.

Six argue tht. where no C‟wealth preference (e.g. wheat) benefit of their system shd. not extend. But they promise to review level of theirs in a hard case. On C. preferential cereals they will give some of the benefit of montant forfetaire (m.f.) : between Six level and 3rd countries. This wd. be fair, so long as price policy is such as to give access.

Aim in recent days : to get assurance tht. access will be secured by reasonable price policy. Six produced their offer. We suggested amendmts requiring them to have due regard to C‟wealth producers; &amp; tht. if substantial decline in imports fr. them Six wd. take remedial action. Six regarded this as extreme demand : designed to freeze pattern of trade for all time. Produced crisis in negotiations.

Bad atmosphere – risk of final breakdown. Counter-draft by Six referred to needs of Six producers &amp; offered confrontation procedure in hard cases. They rejected our proposals for transition. Accepted our demands on post 1970.

Much ill feeling over our domestic agric. policy and privileged posn. of C‟wealth – both w‟out regard to European interests – smouldering for years. At end, got better spirit and contrived to leave next move to them.

We are seeking transitl. system under wh. C‟wealth will have preference v. 3rd countries in U.K. Market ……….

R.A.B. Mtg. on Mon. 23/7 – world agreements subjected to D.S. reservations, which were supported by Cttee. These were rejected – for good intellectual reason (perpetuity) on second (remedial action).

Mtgs. y‟day. Some Ministers felt tht. new amendmt. cd. not be put across to Party &amp; C‟wealth because no definite preservation of C‟wealth posn. We are not takg. Non possomous line. We want to go in. Ray of hope in Menzies‟ tel. v. world agreements plus prior policy – admitting tht. then C. pref. wd. be less important. May therefore be solution in world agreemts : if we can get set of principles inserted. Even so, posn. of N.Z. is not met by present plans. We therefore need time to bring C‟wealth along. Any final concln., publd. on present lines may well be rejected outright by C‟wealth. Can we therefore ascertain what is best Six can offer : and then have time to discuss with C‟wealth.

D.S. Over rest of field in sight of reasonable arrangemts. wh. we cd. defend.

What we need, if we cd. get it, is a little more time to bring C‟wealth along. Australia is the key. Cd. be separate protocol on N.Z. and if we cd. get that posn. wd. be much easier at P.M.M.

Worse course now wd. be to get concln. we cdn‟t defend to Party or C‟wealth. If we can‟t get defensible arrangement this week, better to go to P.M.M. having registered in Brussels a gap on this point reserved for further negotiations with Six.

Whole of new solution terms on world agreemts. Helpful that Six now envisage world conference as early as ‟63. But want to know what wd. happen in remainder of transition if that conference breaks down. All wd. be soluble if there were confidence : how far can we trust Six and persuade others to trust them.

I.M. Fear effect on country if we play for disengagement. If E.H. carries on his present instructns. Press will take result as a break by us.

What we need now is something decisive. This is what country wants.

There is a much bigger majority for entry.

Party Conference : only 10 resolns. on C.M. received &amp; only 1 is

hostile. Favour therefore pushing on. Hope E.H. can be authorised, with D.S. to say if Six can produce N.Z. protocol we will sell the deal.

D.S policy of delay wd. be much more dangerous.

R.M. Pol. problem relates more to long-term than transition. Cd. cope with that if it were more clearly seen tht. world agreements and price policy wd. be reasonable. Favour taking more time to bring old C‟wealth along. Hail. Disposed to agree.

H. Delay will give scope to French to make further trouble.

But much turns on Menzies – &amp; we can‟t let N.Z. perish.

And I doubt wthr. E.H.‟s line cd. be accepted by Menzies.

…. But how cd. delay be contrived?

E.H. When negotns. begin to move twds. concln., greater willingness to reach agreemt. If Six begin to move tomorrow, hard for me to hold back w‟out giving impn. tht. we have changed our posn.

P.T. P.M.M. Can‟t expect them to support, or agree. At best, acquiescence.

Before this, we must be able to say what is best arrangement we can get. Cd. we have another mtg. with Six at end/August? To bring Menzies along m‟while. And let Six see that we are going to meet them again before P.M.M.

E.B. Must not appear to be breaking because we are insisting on comparable outlets. Favour going on with negotns. for a bit.

P.M. Great risks in delay. Wd. increase possibility of our not getting into it at all. And that wd. be disastrous for U.K.

√ If Six make no move towards us, then we can make them appear responsible for the break.

If they do move, try to get greater precision in assurances. If we fail, offer mtg. later to deal with this and all other unfinished business.

√ If you can get fairly reasonable precision, conclude it ad referendum.

All these “conclusions” are provisional : &amp; on this one, which is of special concern to old Doms., we may have more to say after P.M.M.

Formula : accept broad lines of the plan, but make it clear that means by which they will be applied might need further discussion with view to greater precision after P.M.M. together with other loose ends.

R.A.B. What we need now is i) to bring M. along ii) to get promise of special protocol for N.Z.
