C.C.38(62) 29th May 1962

1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter R.M.

a) Disarmament.

H. No progress : prob. recess in June. Then consult U.S.

b) Indonesia.

Doesn‟t look good. Dutch now ready to take Bunker as basis for negotn. but Sokarno goes on dropping men in – rally aggression &amp; may be raised as such in U.N.

c) Germany.

16-17 months since U.S. urged probe to demonstrate tht. E. German Govt. does not exist. This danger has bn. removed. Hope no Br. Govt. will go to war to prove E. German Govt. (to which W. Germany now propose to lend money) doesn‟t exist.

[Enter J.H.

2. Housing Policy.

Ch.H. i) L.a. house bldg. fell last year to 93.000 in E. &amp; W. We need

120/125.000 p.a. to do justice to all needs. At present 105.000 p‟mme

‟64 with possible addn. for slum clearance : achievement likely to be 108.000.

* Wd. wish to reach 120/125.000 in 3-4 yrs‟ time. Can‟t do it in less than 3 yrs. : land, money, techn. staffs limit progress, quite apart from my approvals. Make-up details.

The run down is now being seen and causing disquiet. We are 15.000 below what we need, esp. to make impact on slum clearance.

No. of families to same popn. is increasing.

Seek authority for *. Shan‟t reach it quickly.

ii) Best means of assuring increase in house bldg. wd. be redn. in interest

rates. On best assumptns. on rents &amp; subsidy, l.a. have to find 20-25/= p. wk. to finance a council house. For ½% fall in interest rate, 4/= of that wd. be deducted. Further, l.a.‟s use this as alibi for slowness.

iii) For new imaginative policy, we must look to private bldg. at lower

cost to owners who can‟t afford £300 deposit. Houses are not being built to let. We must try to help these middle groups who don‟t want to be council tenants. We have made £25.000 available. More is needed. Swedish scheme of house ownership thro‟ co-operatives, who borrow on life of house not of individual occupant : new form of occupancy wh. wd. meet needs of our middle group. Need is to enable

co-operatives to borrow at fixed rate over period of years. Fill the gap between l.a.‟s and companies who are in house ownership for profit. I cd. produce practical plan if Cab. approved.

H.B. Housing has fallen to lowest priority in social service p‟mmes.

But shd. not take firm decns. until we have looked at other p‟mmes.

Housing, educn., health must all be looked at together, tho‟ we must take decisions before end/July.

Bldg. industry is under strain : we can‟t get more out of it yet.

Ch.H. But 11% drop in private house starts price opening of year. There is room therefore for more injection of demand.

H.B. Must also consider natd. resources. We haven‟t controlled public expre. : 2½% pledge was not honoured : we gave another – 6% for public service investment. Bids now in are for 11% and we have nothing to spare. Must look at all p‟mmes – tho‟ we cd. expedite normal procedures.

On iii) agree we shd. consider plans.

D.S. We must consider office bldg. again – congestion, as well as use of bldg. resources.

H.B. This is under review.

J.M. Scotland‟s posn. is worse than E. &amp; W. Tho‟ I have not restrained l.a.‟s they have dropped to 27.000 from peak of 39.000. No compensatg. growth in private bldg. Doubt if interest rates are limiting factor.

M. Why wd. it take 3 yrs. to reach higher level?

Ch.H. Land : inefficiency of l.a.‟s etc. On slum clearance propose to get l.a.‟s to combine in consortia : that will speed up.

M. Completion period has risen from 11 mos. to 15.

Ch.H. Builders held off l.a. work : but pressure from private side, which was part cause of longer completions of l.a. houses, is slackening.

M. New towns are quick method.

Ch.H. Yes : shall announce Dawley today. They are beginning to pay. Room for more B‟ham another, Manchr. etc.

F.E. Relate housing to industrial growth, if industry is to expand.

Don‟t look at it solely as social problem.

J.M. A v. big ques.

J.H. Reversal of existing policy.

H.B. Toothill plus offl. cttee. : hope to have material for Min. Cttee. soon.

Hail. Must get costs of house bldg. down – by re-standardisation. W‟out that we shan‟t hit target.

J.Hope Agree : industry must be compelled by demand to standardise more.

Unless they do, industry won‟t be able to meet increased demand.

S.LI. Sub. Cttee. of E.P.C. under Hail has bn. apptd. to press on with this.

P.M. Hope an individual will be apptd. to drive this along. Preferably a dollar a year.

H.B. * Also firm Cab. decision demanding practical plan for controlling office bldg. Agreed.

Investment p‟mme to be considered early.

P.M. * Let me see propns. of houses built by assocns. with variable/fixed rates of interest.

C.S. Use more timber. Forestry Commn. have much to sell.

L.a. prejudices v. timber houses.

D.E. There will be further fall in private development if confidence internationally collapses. P.M. Then State wd. need to do more.

[Exit J. Hope.

3. Leasehold Reform. [Enter Att.G.

Ch.H. This memo. doesn‟t raise diffy. of enfranchisement.

Repns. from particular areas. H.B. asked advice from bodies in Annex.

By Act of 1954 we gave right to remain as statutory tenants, but that is not proving satisfactory.

Suggest enquiry into possibility tht. lease holders shd. have right to extension of lease at market value (where no proposal for re-development) – owner having right to offer sale. Wish to be allowed to say that this is under examination. This would be. re-assurance to leaseholders. Gt. political advantage in Wales and some other areas.

K. 12 yrs. since Jenkins Cttee. reported. 8 years since we gave statutory effect to majority report. Agree time has come to look at it again. Known there are defects in Act of 1954. Support Ch. H. plan.

Att.G. Make it plain tht. it applies only to ground leases of residential property (all). (Mixed shop and residence) shd. be excluded.

Market value plan wd. arouse gt. irritation : in lieu of nominal ground rent. Not much political advantage in makg. announcement on Ch. H. lines. Real pressure is for leaseholders to get their houses for nothing. Prefer therefore to work out a plan w‟out an announcement.

P.M. Cd. you not limit it to low value residences.

Cd. you get acceptance for market value?

Ch.H. Some of the advocates consider this wd. satisfy some of the unease.

Hail. But 99 year old houses ought not to be renewed.

Ch.H. Propose no right of extension if there‟s a plan for re-development.

P.M. Avoid statement until we know what we want to do.

Ch.H. Must say somethg. because of reports in Annex wh. must be published.

Cd. say we are studying problem – in words excluding enfranchisement – confined to residential property.

Agreed : Ch.H. to make statement on these lines

M/Housing to submit practical plan

(Keeping in touch with Att.G., &amp; H.B.)

before July ends – to H.A. Cttee.

4. Diplomatic Immunities.

a) International Organisation.

K. i) 4.700 odd excludg. wives and families : perhaps 8.000 in all.

Add 200-600 for what is now proposed : C. Market wd. bring total up to about 10.000.

ii) Parly. problem in para.7. Debates on Bills and O‟s-in-C.

iii) Para.15 : my plan for limiting further extensions.

Para.16 is also of special practical importance.

S.LI. Revenue wd. like to examine practical apln. of these principles.

120 botts. p.head of spirits is imported w‟out duty each year.

Suggest Cttee. of officials shd. examine practical effects.

Att.G. We have departed from these principles in the past. Shd. we not also consider how much has gone over the dam.

Hail. Para.8 – scientific research bodies. Other countries press for the immunities. If we decline scientists go elsewhere and we lose the advantages. Must take this into account.

b) Vienna Convention.

H. Codification of rules is valuable. Agreed with Dpts. On revenue

point, remember our people get these concessions abroad.

S.H.‟s memo. is wrong on one point : exemption from duty applies only to goods imported into U.K.

K. We joined in negotiating this convention. Wrong to depart from these unilaterally. They are agreed “law of nations” re-stated.

Still desirable tht. Ambassadors shd. not be under local pressure.

H. We argued Ty. case at Vienna, but were out-voted.

S.LI. Cd. it not stand over – ratification is not urgent.

Hail. Can‟t make reservations when whole object was to standardise.

Defeats original object.

Att.G. Legn. will be needed on both points – v. diff. to get it passed, esp. the one relating to servants.

P.M. Let Cttee. of officials report wthr. we can deal with this as a whole – and legn. will be needed.

S.LI. Also wthr. Art.34 and 37 are consistent.

[Exit Att.G.

5. National Assistance. [Enter J.B.C.

J.B.C. N.A.B. will want to propose increases mentioned in my memo.

Agree with H.B. tht. we shall need to move next year because of pensions. Don‟t therefore want to go too far this year. But 3/= wd. only just draw level on single rate and not even that for married. They wd. not therefore give us room to defer next move until we are ready on N.I. All earlier increases have brought figures a little above current value in real terms. C/living already up to 120, which was not expected until July – and purchase tax and coal prices are still to come.

P.M. Must make some change : must introduce resolns. end/July.

Must raise retirement pensions and Service pensions next year.

J.B.C. In equity, legn. mid ‟63 for operation in autumn : tho‟ Service pensions may have to be raised earlier in ‟63.

Timing : it‟s known how long N.A.B. need to make a change; and as it is to be done on c/l. grounds, hard to justify any longer delay.

H.B. My proposal saves £5 m. We ought not to be over generous now, for we want to be able to be or seem generous in the ‟63 increase.

Believe c/l. will stabilise at 119 for 2nd half of ‟62.

J.H. 120 wd. be a safer assumption.

Support J.B.C. on this. N.A.B. may insist on 4/= : don‟t want a public

difference with them.

H.B. Not facing this yet : considering what we say privately to N.A.B.

Consider total bill – this year and next.

J.B.C. We must fix rates which will endure until date in ‟63 when we want to make next increase. C/living may rise in ‟63.

K. Why not 3/6 and 5/6 – the arguments are nicely balanced.

H.B. Last 2 increases have bn. “prosperity increases”. We ought now to be realistic.

Agreed : Try to get N.A.B. Chairman to accept 3/6 and 5/6 on understanding there will be increase of similar amount next year, which will be announced in March. From 1/10.

6. Supersonic Airliner.

Noted. J.A. to be added to Cttee.
