C.C.40(62) 7th June 1962

1. Parliament. [Enter M.R.

M.R. Business for week after recess.

2. National Assistance. [Enter J.B-C.

J.B-C. Chairman N.A.B. has put fwd. alternative proposals, which are acceptable to H.B.

H.B. Costs over £1 m. more than Cab. earlier plan : but important to retain goodwill of Chairman. In current year £10-11 m. or more, and £20½ m. in full year.

If this is accepted, hope we shan‟t commit ourselves to 3/6 for single householder next year. Keep that open.

Approved.

P.M. Announcement after Whitsun will provoke pressure for Pensions (Increases) etc.

H.B. We shd. consider wthr. our intentions on this shd. be announced before end/July or in autumn.

P.M. Why yield to pressure? Better take initiative.

S.LI. If so, announce Pensions (Increase) before P.A. rates.

I.M. Can delay increase in retirement pensions if we are seen to be dealing fairly with hard cases such as Public Service Pensions Increase. I wd. couple that with P.A. rates.

H.B. No objn. so long as it‟s clear tht. we can anticipate Q. Speech and that Bill will be introduced before Xmas.

Agreed : I.M., S.LI, H.W. and J.B-C. to settle timing

of announcements.

[Exit J.B-C.

3. Commercial Policy : Japan.

F.E. Bear in mind general trade advantages we secure.

Wool. Repves. of industry can‟t show good case for rope &amp; yarns : they have exaggerated their diffies. : believe they can be assuaged.

P.T. Japan is a specially keen competitor. Industry wholly against what F.E. proposes on transistors. Ready to discuss with F.E. size of a quota : but free entry wd. knock us about v. much.

F.E. We can impose quota as soon as trade is disrupted.

P.T. I cd. not justify removing all restrictions. Ready to consider escalating arrangements.

R.M. This is expanding market : we must get a share in it.

I have a point on H. Kong which I will put to F.E.

E.M. Japan is useful ally on shipping.

Agreed : F.E. to discuss with Ministers concerned

&amp; report to P.M.

4. United Nations : Colonialism. [Enter Brain.

R.M. Worried about activities of Cttee. of 17. We said we wdn‟t go on co-

x/ operating with them if they “intervened” &amp; this is what they are doing.

Wild men in Colonies – can‟t be controlled if they feel they can appeal to U.N.

R.A.B. S. Rhodesia – example. African Party leaders refused to meet me – prefer to meet repves. of U.N.

If we w‟draw, U.N. pressures won‟t be lessened. Risk of extreme resolns. in our absence. Nor cd. we influence other C‟wealth members.

My concln. : stay in, but consider Crown‟s suggns. Show as much patience as we can.

Any other course wd. be worse.

H. V. difficult. If we w‟draw, they will continue to hear petitions etc. &amp; our friends may vote for awkward resolns. because haven‟t heard our case.

We aren‟t good at walking out – gives wrong “image”.

Believe we wd. be worse off if we left.

R.M. In view of x/ we must do somethg. to mark our disagreement with what they are doing.

H. Fr. reputn. has suffered from w‟drawing.

K. “Intervention” is ultra vires the Charter. Action designed to undermine existg. govt. amounts to “intervention”. You cd. take it to International Court – or threaten to do so.

Hail. Wd. we win, before the Court?

H. My advice is “no”. Let us get L.O.B.

Br. D.S. supports H.‟s view. W‟drawal wd. isolate us, not only from our Afro.Asian members, but from old numbers. We cdnt support it on eg. E. Irian. We shd. disappoint Canada. Our U.N. people favour counter-petitions.

S.H. It wd. be to our disadvantage to w‟draw.

R.A.B. Will become acute in S. Rhodesia this winter. U.N. pressure plus unemplt. will produce security sitn. – we may be able to show it‟s fault of U.N.

H. Will consider Hail‟s suggn. of rough x-examination of witnesses.

H‟to we have bn. concerned to avoid appearance of being on trial.

I.M. W‟out w‟drawing from Cttee., we can refrain from co-operating in any activities we consider to be damaging to particular Colonies.

H. If Assembly debate S. Rhodesia, cd. we not attack activities of Cttee.

Agree : write opinion of L.O. on art.2(7)

Subject to that, don‟t w‟draw from Cttee.

[Exit Brain.

5. Laos.

H. Princes have met. King directed Phonma to form natl. Govt.

Don‟t know how this will go.

Two men fr. Embassy found the 2 doctors but were themselves arrested.

6. Broadcasting Policy. [Enter P.M.G.

R.A.B. 8/6. report will be received. Publn. 27/6.

Highly favourable to B.B.C. – seriously critical of I.T.A. Structural changes are recommended.

We need time for public opinion to crystallise on the controversial issues.

On these no W. Paper until autumn – tho‟ debate before end/July.

M‟while W. Paper only on technical issues.

Will circulate report to Cabinet.

H.B. Ty. will want to see W. Paper in draft because of possibility of increased public expenditure.

Hail. Awkward situation : a better system will cost [more] money.

P.M. Must get it clearly understood tht. there are 2 sides to the main ques. and tht. Govt. reserves its views. May need to put this orally in Parlt.

as well as in W. Paper.

[Exit P.M.G

7. Fishing Fleet.

a) Subsidies for Boats built in foreign yards.

Hail. Defeat in H/Lds. on the Bill. What shall we do on Report?

E.P.C. wished me to try to reverse H/L. decision.

J.M. wants specl. arrangemts. to prevent subsidy going to order for boats from foreign subsidised yards. Believe this can be done by adminn. as it has bn. h‟to.

J.M. New Bill adds distant water trawlers. That is why we had to decide wthr. loans shd. go to boats built abroad. Considered tht. they shd. save for foreign yards wh. are subsidised. We cd. say tht. we shall see to it tht. benefit of the loan doesn‟t have effect of increased extent of foreign subsidy.

E.M. No diffy. in identifying substantial subsidies. More awkward where low interest rates are given.

Have suggd. a procedure (Cttee.) which satisfies ship builders.

P.M. Will the machinery work?

Cttee. to satisfy itself that subsidy shd. not be paid on any order where tender contains any substantial element of subsidy.

J.M. “Can and will ensure by admve. means tht. our subsidies will not have the effect of increasg. extent of foreign subsidy granted to f. yards.” This formula, after consultn. with M/Ag. will be used in H/C.

Hail. And in H/L. I will say tht. I will move amendmt. to restore Bill to posn in which H/c. left it.

b) Subsidies to Scottish Trawler Owners.

J.M. Many owners are in default in repayment of loans to White Fish Authority.

Believe we ought to re-open whole ques. Can‟t otherwise avoid serious pol. diffies.

C.S. We reached agreement with Fedn. on run down over next 10 years. Sc. accepted this as well as English owners. Industry is not profitable because too many boats.

If we re-open this, it will break up Fedn. – whose help is essential to us over Iceland &amp; Faroes. Pol. diffies. will then be even greater.

They are making an operating profit, if depreciation is ignored.

H.B. Accept moratorium in principle.

But agree it wd. be fatal to re-open agreement.

K. Fatal to Govt. to go back on this.

Recall 1955 when alteration in which fish prices wrecked A.E.‟s posn.

J.M. Agree : far more trouble if we re-opened this now.

S.LI. Provn. in Act for supplementary payments?

C.S. We are proposing to give this to middle-water boats.

This, combined with moratorium, shd. appease worst irritation.

J.M. Accept this decision : but warn Cab tht. many boats in Sc. may stop fishing, incldg. some new boats.
