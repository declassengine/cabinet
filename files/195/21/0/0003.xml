C.C.37(62) 28th May 1962

1. Rhodesia. [Enter E.P., R.W., P.M.G., R.M.

P.M. Welcome R.A.B. on his return. Successful mission.

Visit has gained us time. Proof also of value of single control.

R.A.B. Possibility of working for settlement. Atmosphere is better. Fed. Govt. now ready to look to future.

Will report at later mtg.

2. Incomes Policy.

P.M. Surmounted immediate crisis : can now plan for future.

Divided opinions : various plans.

Form objectives – as in notes. Diffies. in achievg. them : but don‟t under-rate our success, despite the ups and downs.

Is it possible to achieve all, in a free society?

How : i) controls? RSC tried and failed because he cdn‟t get support for wage control.

ii) control our own employees? Public services – not for long.

Natd. indies. : we must control thro‟ ‟62. Method : don‟t mind how (tho‟ I wd. prefer to avoid directions because of

repercussions on N.E.D.C. T.U.‟s) etc.

iii) private sector : unless we can influence this, the policy will

fail.

Penalties : after listening to arguments I see fatal objns. to all the

various suggns. Price control : hard to operate w‟out rationing.

Inducements : tax remissions are open to same objns. as sanctions.

Concln. of argument so far – as in para.11 of notes – an acceptable incomes policy, as a permanent measure necessary if 4 main objectives are to be attained. Needs a new and wider approach.

Aided by suggns. recd. from my colleagues I propose a package.

Against us : Press, selfish and anarchical elements in society.

For us : everyone admits now tht. growth in prodn. and growth in income must go broadly together. N.E.D.C. admit tht. 4% target will take some reaching. Therefore, para.16. First task will be to persuade labour that it is fair. Over last 6 yrs. price index has risen by 11 : (taxation level of imports 10) : wages : profits are main contribution to this increase : mainly wages because profits increases have followed wages increases.

Thus, set incomes policy in a wider framework. Something in it to attract all classes. Paras.21-22.

Revaluation of services : conclude we do need a standing Commission for this. This must include industry as well as public services.

Function wd. be advisory.

Profits. We must accept in principle tht. same policy shd. be applied to profits as to wages. If necessary, fiscal action to enforce it.

Prices. Easier if we advance simultaneously on a wide front. Package for consumers. Including some monopolies legn. which will avoid further trouble on the I.C.I./Courtaulds model.

Expansion : hang out some flags : eg. to get 4% growth must have an increase of demand (aside from exports). Apart from monetary measures, which wd. have immediate effect on consumers, we must foreshadow increased Govt. expenditure on housing, schools and universities. Also announce our plans for poor and old.

Presentation. Get it into shape : make a plan of action : consider how to launch it with Parlt., industry, Press etc. Bring in leaders of opinion on fringe of politics.

Caveats : a) task of N.E.D.C. Make it plain that their‟s is a job for experts : this is political appeal to public. They may be relieved.

b) P‟mme for ‟62 and for ‟63. Who is to set target for ‟63?

We must go forward or back (normal procedures plus exhortation to restraint). If we decide to go forward, we must have a package on the lines I have indicated.

S.LI. Grateful to P.M. – also to Cabinet, for support to date.

Tho‟ our political reputn. at home is low, foreign opinion of our policies is v. high.

Endorse proposal for wider approach. Reserve detailed comments.

Expansionist measures must be approached with caution.

Some action can, however, be taken in advance of package – eg. relaxation on special deposits.

D.E. Agree.

Will be difficult to put it over and avoid comment that it does nothing for exports. Savings will follow from a longer look by public, as envisaged. Wd. be good if package cd. also include something to help exports. Also agriculture : we are in bad odour with farmers and are thought to be against increased prodn. Can anything be said to them?

J.H. Have started study on contract of service. Employers are responsive.

This wd. rally morale of workers.

x/ May be able to do somethg. on redundancy.

Re-training oblign. will have to be accepted – as some industries (eg. rlways) must contract.

Welfare. Gowers Bill next session (offices &amp; shops). Approachg. industry on appln. of new Factories Act.

Save for x/ I foresee no diffies. with my share in all this.

F.E. Opportunity for next 2 years. We cd. put it across &amp; make some progress in carrying it through.

But formidable amount of legn. wd. be involved.

Exports : will see what I can suggest, tho‟ I doubt wthr. any special incentive will be practicable.

H. Timing. Atmosphere for such an approach wd. be dispelled by a major strike. Shall we not need to hurry?

P.M.G. T.U.‟s wd. not easily reject such a plan. Pending this, hold on to pause.

Ch.H. This cd. meet our need for a theme.

From this angle, essential it shd. remain a package. Must be presented as a whole.

As background to incomes policy, it goes long way to meet charge of unfairness. But needs a closer connn. with task of influencing private sector.

K. Support Ch. H.‟s point v. strongly. Appeal to all classes.

Seek dramatic means of presentation. Act quickly.

Suggest we authorise P.M. to prepare plan on these lines.

D.S.) Indicated support. Strike note of national unity. Urgency.

H.W.) “ “

M. Wd. like more time to reflect. Some elements wd. add to costs – want to be sure we get a return from workers.

R.M. So wd. I. Esp. on long term interest rates : freeze relations betwn. wages &amp; profits.

J.M. Will this be sufficiently attractive to middle classes? Effects of plans mentioned won‟t be felt for some time.

H.B. Resale price m‟tenanance will re-act quickly.

J.M. But some in middle class will be hurt by that.

R.A.B. Pleased at resuscitation of Ind. Charter (contract of service).

Welcome P.M.‟s lead.

Any method of ensuring tht. collective bargaining and arbitn. observe the policy?

J.H. Not yet : eventually N.E.D.C.

P.M. Standing Commn. wd. help. Its advice wd. make reasons more clear.

H.B. But it is decisions in private sector which have undermined our policy.

C.S. Food prices must rise if we join C. Market. Even if we don‟t, we can‟t relieve burden on Exchequer w‟out increased price to consumers.

Hail. Ultimate problem is inflation. Net result of package may be inflationary – tho‟ attractive politically. Nothing to offset its inflationary elements.

P.M. Will circulate my notes.

Timings must hold on to natd. indies. claims pro.tem.

esp. railways. (M. Crunch won‟t come until Aug/Sept).

S.LI. I cdn‟t delay minor relaxation until package announced. (Agreed).

P.M. Machinery for working this out.

Cttee. of Ministers responsible for action. ) P.M. in

Parallel Cttee. on presentation. ) Chair for

both.
