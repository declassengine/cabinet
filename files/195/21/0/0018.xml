C.C.53(62) 3rd August 1962

1. Europe. [Enter M.R., 3 Service Ministers.

P.M. Directive given to L.P.S. in agreement. D.S. has accompanied him.

No developments yet in Brussels.

2. Malaysia.

P.M. Apparent discrepancy betwn. agreement &amp; views of Br. members of Cobbold. Major interest of U.K. to get settlement. Transition much shorter than recommended 5 years.

3. Congo.

H. Move in U.N. that countries shd. voluntarily refuse to take copper from Katanga.

P.M. Free market in Ldn., tho‟ we use relatively little ourselves.

F.E. We shd. be in diffies.

H. Have said we can‟t touch this. Hope others won‟t press it.

4. Blue Water.

P.M. Memo. by R.M. &amp; P.T. putting to Def. Cttee. a no. of agreed proposals on weapons. Included in this was plan to abandon B.W. and rely on T.S.R.2. to cover any gap.

Theory in N.A.T.O. since ‟54 tht. tactical n. weapons be used to secure a pause before a strategic strike. For this we have U.S. weapons Honest John and Corporal. We then began to develop B.W. and U.S. to develop Sergeant. Need we go on? Do we believe that a tactical battle will be fought with n. weapons? Destruction such that no movement cd. take place on battlefield – and escalation to strategic exchange inevitable. Proper use of tactical n. weapons wd. be to impose a pause to show our will to use strategic strike : for this purpose better put under single command, via diffused among the various armies. U.S. already recognising need for addl. control (radio) over these weapons.

But, while the N.A.T.O. strategy remains as it is, what wd. be effect on morale of B. Army if they are told they can‟t have this weapon.

P.T. More than money is involved. But estimates are £100 m. up; and supplementaries are coming in too. For once I, as M./D. am in complete agreement with Ch/Exch.

Not only money over-strained. In attempt to support N.A.T.O.

deterrent &amp; worldwide resources, our mil. resources are overstretched.

This too is part of background. We must be selective.

Saving on B.W. = minimum of £70 m. over 6-8 yrs.

Plan : 16 in 2 ngts. in B.A.O.R.

Progressively doubtful wthr. sort of war for which this weapon was designed wd. ever be fought. 7.000 of them in Eurpe already : 240 M.T. yield.

This is not artillery.

But this is still offl. policy of N.A.T.O., &amp; won‟t be quickly changed. If t. nuclear weapon is needed, T.S.R.2 can deliver what I believe will be needed.

C.O.S. do not accept C.D.S. view. C.I.G.S. argue tht. armies on our flanks will have Sergeants and our troops shd. have their own. C.A.S. says T.S.R.2 cd. do the job better, with 1.000 m. range and greater flexibility.

Ques. : i) in principle do we need this weapon?

ii) if not, how can we best stop developing it? (Costs x. £25.000 p.a.)

J.P. This arose out of „economy‟ exercise.

Involves new reversal of existg. policy based on financial grds.

1957 W. Paper : based on smaller no. of well armed forces, supported by n. strength. Army have reduced artillery on assumptn. they wd. have this surface to surface tactical n. weapon.

Credibility of N.A.T.O. resolve is based, not on man power (in which we are out numbered), but on tactical n. strength. Doubtful wthr. we shd. use it all in a tactical weapon; but strategy assumes we shd. make at least some use of it. Only way of stopping R.

C. of Rhine is by tactical n. weapon.

Army don‟t believe T.S.R.2 cd. do this job. B.W. is a better weapon.

T.S.R.2‟s wd. be needed in other roles – some might be lost. Airfields vulnerable, also. This is SACEUR‟s view : he wdn‟t have asked all Allies to have this weapon if he thght aircraft cd. do the job.

Morale. Army has bn. knocked about. They shdn‟t be asked to do w‟out this. Alternative of artillery – weapons not available &amp; in any event wd. need more men.

SACEUR, when told, wd. say it was wrong. V. serious.

R.M. Estimates as submitted were 8% up. Reduced, with P.T., to 5½% : even that is bad enough.

Real deterrent is our strategic n. power. Some tactical needed too : but surely we in N.A.T.O. have already more then he cd. use. Why

develop new weapon, not available for 3 yrs. when we already have enough.

J.A. Cancelln. wd. wipe out one of two design teams : cause unemployment : blow to B.A.C.

Is there a way of keeping this open? Cut out prodn. of Thunderbird II and reduce practice shots of B.W. – saving £50 m. or so.

J.T. Wd. prefer to reduce, or even abandon, these AA weapons rather than B.W. Allied air defence is available.

H. N.A.T.O. policy for pause. Strategic exchange = 400 m. people in 3 days.

Tactical wd. at least be confined to a narrow area in E. Germany/Poland.

Agree tht. was of movement under these circs. unlikely to be practicable. But no challenge yet to use of some tactical n. weapons to enforce a pause &amp; this cd. be done by T.S.R.2. This, however, not yet accepted by U.S. and N.A.T.O. Case for putting this under separate command.

But how can we present this? Cdn‟t defend leaving B.A.O.R. with weapons inferior to those on their flanks or those opposite. Can we say T.S.R.2 is just as good for this purpose?

Better, I believe, to base this decision on changed strategy.

Even tho‟ this means delay. It is however a complete change of policy. Propose P.M. to Kennedy : P.T. to Macnamara : then argument in N.A.T.O.

C.S. Two separate arguments.

i) If we cancel B.W. now, we shall have to say tht. we have unilaterally taken view on strategy. Can we justify such a unilateral taken view on strategy. Can we justify such a unilateral decn. to Army : that ours will be only army in Europe which is w‟out its own n. tactical weapons. Wd. invite R. attack on our front.

ii) If we are to have such a weapon, shd. it be BW? I said at time we cdn‟t make this for ourselves alone. It is better than Sergeant but U.S. determined to have their own &amp; sell it to Allies.

And against their competn. we can‟t sell ours.

Western countries can‟t each develop their own type of these sophisticated weapons.

But don‟t cancel B.W. so long as each N.A.T.O. Army has its own t. weapon.

R.M. Common sense : tell Americans we shall try to alter strategy &amp; that, if

we fail, we shall have to take Sergeants on easy terms – in ‟66/7.

Hail. If we go on with n. development for Europe, we shan‟t be able to afford mil. effort in M/E or F/E. Option must be taken soon.

R.A.B. B.A.C. view : of weapon venture was an element in merger : its w‟drawal wd. be regarded as breach of faith.

Time also will be needed over unemplt. in Stevenage.

These problems shd. be eased if it were not unilateral decision contrary to agreed strategy of N.A.T.O.

J.H. The men cd. be absorbed into other emplt. under a proper redundancy plan.

F.E. Cd. you delay T.S.R.2. to cover next years‟ cost of B.W.

P.M. a) Convinced that tactical battle with n. weapons is unrealistic.

Norstadt. has collected 7.000 of these, with total yield of about 250 M.T.

b) Accept tht. SACEUR shd have some t.n. weapons for discriminatory use to impose – pause or demonstrate our will to use strategic.

c) But needs time to convince U.S. &amp; N.A.T.O. that this change of strategy is inevitable.

d) Pressure of manufacturers‟ lobbies in U.S. is growing. Ruthless

pushing of inferior Sergeant. Interdependence is breaking down.

Timing: If by ‟66 other armies have Sergeants, our Army will have to be re-armed with comparable weapon.

We can‟t publicly proclaim our view of strategy. We can‟t say T.S.R.2 wd. suffice for N.A.T.O. strategy as now.

Alternatives: a) cancel B.W. &amp; say we will buy Sergeants if they are needed

b) continue B.W. &amp; seek change of N.A.T.O. strategy.

E.B. Early decision.

Why spend £70 m. on weapon, of which SACEUR already has more than enough to do a job which prob. won‟t by 1966 seem to be a necessary one.

K.J. Support – despite Stevenage.

E.P. Strategic is wrong, obviously.

Cancel : say that, if strategy is unchanged by ‟66, we will buy Sergeant. That involves no failure to fulfil treaty obligns.

P.M. U.S. vested interests will then thrust Sergeant on us.

J.P. Won‟t get it unless you order it now.

B. Don‟t continue B.W. Press for change of strategy.

P.M. Must avoid posn. in wh. U.S. pressures will be for us to buy Sergeants.

Better to say : We doubt validity of strategy. If, however, some

tactical n. weapons are requd., in Europe, we believe

T.S.R.2 can fulfil this role. Cancel B.W. in order to

concentrate our contn. add in projects which are to go fwd.

Read draft message to Mr K.

Believe we shd. have to come out openly v. tactical battle with n. weapons.

Agreed : resume at 4 p.m.
