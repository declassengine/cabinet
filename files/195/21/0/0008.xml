C.C.43(62) 28th June 1962

1. Parliament. [Enter M.R.

2. Broadcasting Policy. [Enter P.M.G.

[Exit P.M.G.

3. Nyasaland and Rhodesia. [Exit R.M.

R.A.B. Banda has arrived. Real problem of N. is repercussion on Fedn. &amp; its other 2 territories. But advance essential : Malawi in control &amp; their Ministers brighter than those elsewhere in Fedn. Must be greater degree of self-govt. Europeans (only 8.000) wd. prefer African majority plus bill/rights. Diffies. i) early succession : must refuse until autumn when advisers have bn. able to report and, if poss, N.R. elections held.

ii) Independence : can‟t give a date now &amp; this may mean a row.

Fed. Govt. cd. not take this, while own independence out of sight for me – complete frankness :

R.W. Can‟t allege breach of faith.

Ask therefore for endorsement of para.16.

K. Support.

D.S. Only poss. course. Banda will give trouble over (ii) – will represent it as consequential on (i). If Fedn. dissolved &amp; its powers restored to S.E. will be hard to w‟hold formal independence from them.

H. Self.govt. stops short of control of external relations.

H.B. x/ £1 m. p.a. from us, &amp; 4 m. from Fedn. – goes to N. How is this to be provided after accession? Br. taxpayer won‟t relish this.

R.A.B. May be a chance of some economic association of N. with the 2 R.‟s

S.R. will be white govt. for 10-12 yrs. unless they are willing to change constitution. This is for them &amp; at present they won‟t look at it.

x/ Plus £1¼ m. remitted from Nyasas working in 2 other countries.

B.S. Afr. Co. want special guarantee in constitn. for their posn. Wd. prefer to w‟hold this.

H. Have U.K. Parlt. power to resolve Fedn.?

R.W. Will take this point in respect of the R.‟s.

R.A.B. Jennings is advising R.W. in since contrary to L.O.‟s views. I am getting considered legal opinion &amp; will send it out to Fed. Govt.

Team of advisers : will be announced today. Roger Stevens, Home,

Arthur Brown, David Scott. Acceptable to R.W. Grateful to F.O.

4. Oversea Aid : Egypt.

H. Buley‟s advice on alternative plans. Explained the alternatives.

Italy likely to loan $12 m. and Germany $12 or 15 m. Ours must come at same time – prob. next week.

Buley rejects 6 and 6. Choice between 3 : 9 and 4 : 8.

Dated repayments will be diff. for E. opinion. We may have to be content with assurance tht. exchange will be available for future transfers as and when they arise. Better chance on this if we offer 4 : 8.

I.M. Opinion in H/C. will be influenced by chance of getting oblign cleared up finally.

H. Tell Buley to try 4 : 8 if we can get the early dates for payment.

H.W. They are not being such a nuisance in Aden.

Agreed : Buley to be authorised accordingly.

5. Economic Situation.

S.LI. No need yet to modify f‟casts made before Budget.

4% increase in prodn. in 12 mos. from Apl. ‟63. B/p. posn. shd. improve in 1st half ‟63. Car prodn. still rising : bank advances up by £50 m. May-June : heavy de-stocking in spring must stop : c/l. will flatten out and release more for spending on c. durables :

£60-80 m. p.a. shd. be released by h.p. changes.

No down-turn in U.S. over 6 mos. ahead, tho‟ increase will slacken : trend in Europe is upwards. Export orders even for ships higher than ‟57.

M‟facturing investment – no foreseeable drop in total.

Anxieties : i) by stimulating too soon, we may have to re-impose restn. in spring.

ii) private investment. Shd. we try to stimulate it? I‟m not in favour of tax concessions now. Cd. consider in reln. to next Budget.

In internatl. field, my concern is tht. t/trade are still running in our favour – since this restricts purchasing power of primary producers. This shd. be considered at B/Fund Mtg.

J.H. C/l. 120.

S.LI. May stay around this until end/year.

J.H. Demand for labour is falling slightly – redn. in unemplt. is less than usual for June.

I.M. Tho‟ overall posn. is satisfy, regional problems are sharpening – eg. Scotl.

S.LI. E.P.C. discn. y‟day on Coal/Rlway/Docks discharge of man power over next 5 years. Need better presentation for re-deployment plans.

E.M. Yes : esp. for men over 50.

M. Agree with S.LI. on (ii). But doubt basis for his general optimism.

Effect of U.S. financial crise de confiance.

F.E. Agree : mood of increasg. lack of confidence in U.K. industry.

Will affect D.I. contn. to mine closure plans.

J.M. Need for better policy on populn. movement. Both on merits and because Labour Party may produce a clear policy.

D.E. Stock Exchange revaluation of stocks, in U.S. and Ldn., must falsify estimates we were given at time of Budget. U.S., Germany, Japan are all beginning to tighten up on trade. And, if commodity prices are also weakening – all this must falsify the earlier estimates.

Internatl. lack of confidence always has depressing effect. And clear there is less confidence than in April.

S.LI. But specific stimulatg. action taken since April.

Hail. Cd. West stand a serious internatl. recession? Shd. we not consult on this?

S.LI. Yes : but we can &amp; do consult – I.M.F., O.E.C.D., etc. all make it much easier to handle financial crises. These mechanisms are being used, unobtrusively.

P.M. Reflect and resume discn.

Somewhat pessimistic. U.K. action wdn‟t be conclusive. Is there a fundamental change, however? U.S. accustomed to growing prosperity are easily discouraged. Europe, aided by U.S. money is flourishing &amp; may provide better outlets for our exports than N. America. But, if each country takes protective action required by its own state taken in isolation, our exports wd. suffer seriously.

Emergency action taken for Canada won‟t correct fundamental ills.

Diff. to know how to handle U.S. over this situation.

Agree tht. spectacular Govt. action (Heads of Govt. mtg.) wd. weaken internatl. confidence still further – too alarming. But we are all trading

beyond our reserved. Obscured for 15 yrs. by out-pouring of U.S. wealth, where they had excess of it. Worse if Mr. K. can‟t control Congress. This is problem in wh. Ty. shd. address themselves.
