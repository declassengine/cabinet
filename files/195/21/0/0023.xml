C.C.58(62). 4th October 1962

1. Railway Wages. [Enter M.R.

J.H. Views of Wages Cttee. – as set out in C.143.

E.M. On tactics : believe Beeching is wrong &amp; cd. be so persuaded.

P.M. History &amp; tradition of old Unions, like the rlways, requires a process of bargaining. Rlway unions won‟t be content without this. This comes out in today‟s Times. B. wants to avoid being called mean : he can put the blame on Govt., who won‟t provide the money.

Agreed : tactics must not be “take it or leave it”.

E.M. Consultation – on closing shops [and lines] Union leaders were affronted because B. disclosed details to men themselves simultaneously with leaders.

Leaders feel they have bn. deprived of chance of negotiating themselves.

P.M. On closing lines there will be procedure for hearing repns. etc. and final appeal to Minister.

E.M. This applies in form only to passenger services, where decn. rests with me. But we will in fact consult use on goods services. For my Dpt. will have to look at their road p‟mme in the light of his rlway plan.

R.M. Better to have wage and closure ques. negotiated together. For a higher wage award cd. be justified by men‟s acquiescence in closure p‟mme.

4% even 5% wd. be tolerable if the whole thing were agreed.

My hunch is that the men don‟t expect more than 6%.

P.M. We are in for period of industrial change. To get growth, we must have contraction in the older industries. We must get the country to face this. cf. success with which this switch was made in Lancs., with help of Govt. financial aid.

P.T. The 3% has cost Ty. nothing because run down in numbers.

Easier to justify another 5% or so if wage bill cd. be shown to remain stable.

R.M. Useful also if wage increase cd. be linked with agreement to scales of redundancy payments.

P.M. R.M. &amp; E.M. to see B. i) Get him to accept negotn. as

understood by rlway unions : as matter of tactics.

ii) Govt. cd. more easily justify higher wage award if there were agreement on method of handling closures.

iii) Easier still if simultaneous settlement on redundancy terms for the shops – with prs. assumptn. tht. they wd. be basis for rlways too.

iv) On that basis better to have full wage increase given now than deferred in past until 1st Jan.

2. Queen‟s Speeches.

Provisionally approved, subject to adjustment. [Enter J.A., Fraser

3. Supply of Arms : Middle East.

H. Asked Mrs Meyer wthr. this was definite : she said yes. And it‟s clear tht. Israel will buy Hawk, for pol. reasons. But still uncertain wthr. U.S. Govt. have gone beyond offer in principle : they claim they still have not decided to negotiate a sale.

Reaction from Arabs not v. strong – overshadowed by Yemen. But irritation at U.S. in growing.

If U.S. want to play this long they can. Propose to ask Rusk how he will play it. If long, we need do nothg. If sale really is imminent, we must let our firms make enquiries – tho‟ we can‟t subsidise purchases. Even then, we must consider each country on its merits.

J.A. Doubt if U.S. will give reliable answer.

Tho‟ only £10 m. if you don‟t get into this market you get nowhere.

Br. firms are anxious to try.

P.M. Conflicting evidence. Press Rusk to disclose his intentions. Unless he can assure us they will play it for 2 years or so, we must allow our firms to try – warning them we shd. need to consider each appln. on merits and no U.K. Govt. financing of purchases.

J.A. Cd. we not match U.S. attitude. E.g. if he plays it long, let our firms try but let Govt. apply brake to adjust timing.

H. If we move into this, go to Arabs – not to Jews first.

From F.O. angle, we wdn‟t go into this at all. It will lead us into endless diffies. e.g. with Egypt. Only doing it for sake of aircraft industry.

Fr. Weapons will come from R.A.F.

J.A. But some benefit to industry because of repeat orders.

P.M. Send firm message to Rusk – if assured you will spin

this out for 2 years, we wd. prefer to m‟tain status quo.

Later : Tell firms to avoid Israel, go to Kuwait – but they will need permission for a deal, both political and financial.

Tell Rusk what we are doing – makg. it clear we wd.

still prefer to call it all off. Give him 3 days or so to

answer.

F.O. to tell French what we are doing.

4. Short Brothers &amp; Harland.

P.M. Do we shut it, or try to carry it on by sub-contracting – tho‟ design staff will have to go.

H.B. N.I. will regard even the second as breach of faith (para.8). Also will argue we are overloaded in Gt. B. &amp; this cd. make it work. Hall Rpt. can‟t be fulfilled in many respects &amp; this will concentrate criticism on the Shorts question.

Why can‟t Belfast aircraft be adapted to a new R.A.F. requirement which Shorts cd. meet?

B-C. Distinguish betwn. design team and the rest. We have enough designers already &amp; it‟s clear there‟s nothing for this team to do.

B.T. Agree tht. R.A.F. requirement must be modified. But, even so, I don‟t believe there is scope for Shorts on this.

Cost of providing this employment in N.I. is running at £2.000 p.a.

per head.

Agreed : i) put up cash to finish 10 Belfasts.

(9 mos. work before run-down starts.)

H.B. But, if we do nothing, there will be 2.000 redundancies from a Govt. factory – gt. pol. diffy.

P.T. Can‟t pledge sub-contracting work w‟out knowing what it is.

J.A. Decision on Beverly replacement must be taken by end/62.

D.S. Must make a plan for closing this firm down in a years‟ time.

E.B. Basic problem of N.I. is tht. industry is non competitive. Can‟t be sense to prolong the most non competitive enterprise there.

Agreed : ii) continue to push out some sub-contracting

V.C.10 etc.

iii) take early decision on Beverly replacement.

P.M. Reserve possibility of ordering a few more Belfasts.
