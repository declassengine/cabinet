C.C.42(62) 26th June 1962

1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter M.R.

a) Laos.

H. National Govt. formed. Gromyko has agreed tht. Geneva Conf. shd. be re-convened.

Hope agreement will be endorsed. Hope R. won‟t insist on w‟drawal of troops from Thailand.

b) China.

H. Comm. Ch. troop movements are defensive. Nat. may have put some units on to m‟land.

2. Cuba.

F.E. Handed in draft memo. &amp; spoke from it.

Believe we shd. resist U.S. pressure : important ques. of principle.

H. We defeated original U.S. proposals to N.A. Council.

Their revised proposals are to discuss with us after event or report to N.A.T.O. after event. These mean v. little to us : hope we can accept.

P.M. a) We have agreed to embargo on arms.

b) Transhipment of embargoed U.S. goods. Have we power to do

this?

F.E. Yes : for U.K. – Export and Import Act.

H. But b) has bn. dropped. Present proposals are in para.2.

P.M. We cd. accept para.2(a). There is such a reporting system already for R. and other Communist countries. This only adds Cuba to the list.

P.T. The real rub is para.5. Where will this lead?

Hail. Why agree with nonsense?

R.M. Because other N.A.T.O. allies will go along with this &amp; we want to keep with them so as to get their support in resisting more.

D.S. U.S. feel v. strongly about this. Wd. be a mistake to upset them over this.

H. Wd. much prefer to complain of other U.S. actions in trade, while agreeing with this harmless proposal.

P.T. ) Supported H.‟s line as above.

J.H. ) This is sensible line.

P.M. Ready to write to Mr. K. &amp; make the general point, illustrating it with examples.

S.LI. Also make it plain to U.S. tht. we don‟t think this sensible &amp; are only agreeing to it in order to fall into line with N.A.T.O.

P.M. Make it plain in N.A.T.O. that we believe in expanding trade with

x/ Communist countries.

Two communications to U.S. i) on x/. includg. our anti-

COCOM view. ii) on our own trade grievances v. U.S.

3. Common Market.

E.H. A day mtg. opening in Brussels – 6 or 7 powers alternating acc. to agenda.

i) Temperate f‟stuffs, old C‟wealth countries. Views of Six will be elicited : ground will be prepd. for further work by Deputies.

ii) India/Pakistan/Ceylon. E.E.C. will treat textiles on basis of

remedial action if damage is done. Tea : zero tariff. Manufactd. goods : gradual décollege. Assumption of trade agreement between Community and these countries before 1966(?).

Mght be better to try to keep this open until Desai gets here. But Six are ready : our own textile lobby is exertg. pressure. Better therefore to get main details settled now.

iii) Associated status. Six have reached agreement on finance, tariff price stabilisation schemes. No right of veto by existg. associates on applns.

from new ones. Diffies. more likely to come here from our C‟wealth countries eg. Ghana.

iv) Domestic agriculture. Must begin to tackle part of this – leaving aside

pro.tem commodity schemes &amp; direct grant to farmers.

The Six are working hard on this. Looks as tho‟ we shall get outline by early August.

C.S. On (iv) we can discuss outline.

Transition : we asked for 12-15 yrs. No give on this yet – either on period or on masters in own house.

Annual review : they will accept something but not clear it will be accepted as means to an end. viz., tht,. Council of Ministers shd. have influence on levels of prodn. of commodities. For some (cereals and sugar) they have got mechanisms to produce this control : but on others

they haven‟t &amp; don‟t seem to want it.

Direct grants : not yet discussed as general subject, but raised in connn. with beef (calf subsidy) and ill received.

Six have moved more slowly on their own agric. policy. Now seems unlikely tht. they will conclude in time to enable us to present a clear picture to our farmers. Eg. they have no policy on milk, which is so important to us.

A fair chance of getting somethg. which our agric. cd. live with : but not, I fear, enough to make it poss. for us to sell it to farmers.

At this stage right to concentrate on annual review and residual assurance (farmers‟ incomes).

D.S. Asian products will be crucial in next few weeks. Their economies depend on narrow range of products. While acceptg. review for remedial measures, we must try to accelerate appln. of remedial measures. Presentationally, important to bring out nil tariff on tea at same time as less satisfy. plan for textiles.

On (iii), pol. antagonism led by Ghana. But, if we can show offer as good as for ex. French territories, we shall have discharged our obligns. to our members.

On (i) which is real crux we must try to elicit proposals from Six.

Then prs. aim at further round at P.M.M. in Sept.

R.M. Qua. Colonies we ought to be able to get a good deal.

On C‟wealth generally, fundamental diff-y. is tht. Six won‟t recognise need for continuing special posn. W‟out something on this we may seem to be choosing Europe vice C‟wealth.

E.H. On Colonies, we shall secure a better preferential posn.

On Asians, remedial measures are a special favour to 1970, followed by trade agreement.

On old C‟wealth countries Fr. argue tht. they will be in same posn. as 3rd countries. To improve on that, we shd. need a new preference wh. wd. be v. difficult with U.S.

4. Canada.

S.LI. 300 m. from Fund : 100 m. from U.K. currency in Fund which will count against our drawing not fully repaid.

Deposit of sterling with Bank of Canada.

Canadian measures – reduce flow of internatl. trade.

Trouble : weak political posn. of Dief. Can he carry conviction?

R.M. Outflow of capital is their problem not inflow of goods. These

measures don‟t touch the former.

Hail. To extent that these measures are restrictive, of internatl. trade, they may hasten recession (world) which some think imminent.
