C. 40(54)							15th June, 1954



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter S.Ll., B-H.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Hope Finance Bill Cttee. can be finished on 24/6.



R.A.B.	Will do my best – tho’ many amendmts. and new Clauses.





		2.	Future of Colonial Service.



O.L.	Re-organn. has bn. examined for some time.  Paper on this has bn. produced – includg. change of title to Overseas Service.  Want to announce at Corona Club Dinner on Thursday.  P.M. suggests that I shd. circulate copies to members of Cabinet : unless objn. is raised by letter I will speak as proposed on Thursday.



RAB.}	Have bn. consulted &amp; support this.

Sw.     }



		3.	Foreign Affairs.



P.M.	A.E. hopes to return Thurs. or Friday.  Will make statement on Tuesday re Geneva Conference.  Shall promise ths. in reply to P.Q.’s today.

	I had thght a debate we. be needed : A.E. prefers to avoid that.

	If pressed, I can say we can consider, after statement, wtr debate is needed.

	Visit to W’ton.  Cabinet were anxious tht. we shd. go together.

	Luckily U.S. took initiative in suggesting a week’s delay.

	Shall announce in H/C. this p.m.  Leave here 24/6 : shall not stay more than 3 nights at White House.



H.C.	There will therefore be pressure for F.A. debate on Wedy. 23/6.



P.M.	Not unreasonable – will convey your view to A.E.



J.S.	Might be better to have statement and debate on Wedy.



H.C.	If he made statement on Tues., he wdn’t need to open debate on Wedy.



								[Enter A.H., C.I.G.S.



		4.	Recruitment of Gurkhas.



A.H.	Ty. have bn. consulted on cost.



R.A.B.	Weakness of plan : underestimates India’s influence on Nepal.

	Not certain tht. this manoeuvre will secure continued recruitment.

	But hope is to cement close relns. with India.

	Don’t want to stop any plan : but wd. like to discuss means of reducing cost.



Sw.	Nehru is satisfied with this plan.  On basis tht. we will recruit in Nepal &amp; remove these camps fr. India, he won’t object.  If we haven’t removed them by Indian election in 1956, Nehru won’t be able to resist pressure to stop recruitment.

	Plan therefore is vitally important.

	Cost cd. be reduced if more use was made of local labour &amp; more improvisation was accepted.  Less planning by W.O. works depts.



R.A.B.	Cd. we get assurance fr. India tht. they won’t press Nepal to repudiate

            x|	agreemt. in 1958.



P.M.	Tell Nehru : no Gurkhas, no gunboats.



Sw.	Wd. discuss with colleagues wtr x/ wd. be wise.  Doubt it.

	Nepal’s interest is in continuance of recruitment.



		Approved in principle – subject to considn. of x/ and discussion 	with Ty. on cost.



							[Exit A.H., C.I.G.S.

		5.	China : Diplomatic Relations.



S.Ll.	A.E. wants to clinch this while in Geneva.

	Our man is responsible for “discussing practical arrangemts for establishg dipl. relns.”.  We have called our man Chargé d’Affaires.

	We wd. not treat their man any differently.



P.M.	In earlier discn. I deprecated doing this now.

	But sitn. has changed.   i) B. Smith has recd. it quietly.

				 ii) my visit will allay any U.S. irritation.



S.Ll.	Leak in D. Express – further reason for clearing it up quickly.



Sal.	I was against recognn. in 1950 because it wd. impair Anglo/U.S. relations.

	This proved correct.

	Don’t exclude possibility tht. R. &amp; Ch. want this now for same reason.

	Don’t oppose what is suggested.  Hope their appointmt. will not go 

	x||	beyond terms of our own.  Give no impn. tht. we are takg. a further step twds. full recognn. [– or variation in our view on seating China in U.N.]  Don’t show greatly increased friendliness to China.



S.Ll.	I accept x||, fully.

	We have called our man Chargé d’ Affaires, tho’ he has not bn. one.

	Ready to suggest to A.E. tht. he be described as “a representative” in para. 8 of Geneva Tel. 658.

H.M.	From Sal.’s angle, better to do it now &amp; make it a part of the Geneva misunderstandings with U.S.



		Agreed : subject to S.Ll. speakg. to A.E. re announcing in reply 

		to P.Q. today.





		6.	Dr. Cort.



M.F.	He was Communist in U.S. &amp; has m’tained those connns. in U.K.

	I can’t say that.

	But it is our policy to avoid having stateless persons here : and he may be deprived of U.S. citizenship.

	Anti-U.S. claque in H/C. want it on pol. asylum basis.  But H.O. view is tht. this applies only to persons whose life or liberty are in danger in their own country.

	I therefore propose to stand firm.  Labour M.P.’s are sending me deputn.



P.M.	Fear there may be criticism.



		General support in Cabinet for M.F.’s proposed line of action.





		7.	Parliament : Members’ Expenses.



P.M.	R.A.B. produced simple allowances plan.  I understood it wd. go down pretty well in H/C.  But colleagues with whom RAB discussed it took less favourable view – and a different plan has now bn. evolved.

	Don’t like final para.  Better to make short statement &amp; leave that I. Revenue detail to a paper in Vote Office.



R.A.B.	I preferred my original plan.  Simpler &amp; more dignified.

	My colleague believe it wd. not be accepted by Tories.

	Alternative plan of subsistence allowances has therefore bn. worked out.

	Objn. of subsistence is tht. you must differentiate betwn. Ldn. &amp; others.  Small amount for Ldn. men will excite ridicule.

	But we cd. pray in aid L. Govt. system.  Also Australian plan of £2 a day for M.P.’s.  There are precedents.

	Wd. be ready to make statement general &amp; put details in a White Paper, including final para.

	Other problems :	i) what do we say re Junion Ministers – which

needs legn.

				ii) Pensions Fund. Trustees have met, &amp; we cd.

say so.  I’m disposed to give Exchequer grant.

				ii) This is called “a new proposal”.  Wd. wish to 

consult Opposn. before statement is made.  This

is H/C. matter &amp; we have to live with them.		We might offer allowance for postage, as

alternative which some Members cd. take

instead. 

				iv) Resolution imposing a charge wd. be needed.

				We put Whips on.  What is our position if we 

				don’t carry it.



B.H.	On iv) our supporters have bn. promised a free vote to the end.

	There are precedents for allowg. free vote on Suppl. Estimates for such purposes as these.



P.M.	Cd. not expect our supporters to be influenced by Whips on this.

	We shall have to concede a free vote.

	Let us get a plan &amp; then seek agreement with Opposn. tht. they will accept it.  If they won’t, then do no more.



M.F.	Last scheme represents most that majority of Tories, in H/C. and country would accept.  Believe ⅔rds. wd. accept it, reluctantly.

	General allowance, tho’ simple, is open to criticism tht. it is much the same as salary increase.

	Subsistence allowances can be justified by reference to practice elsewhere.

	Accept RAB.’s view on ii) and iii).

	On iv), if H/C. will take this, they get it : if they won’t they get nothing.



R.A.B.	M. Mellish won’t relish 10/= or 12/6, for Ldn. residents.



H.C.	This wd. be easier to defend.  Flat allowance can’t be differentiated fr. salary increase.  This is confined to Session.  Distinction is logical betwn. m’taining one bed &amp; two.  L. Govt. allowances afford a real precedent.

	Concerned only at proposal that a man living in Ldn. shd. draw the

      x|	allowance while visiting constituency.  Wd. prefer to have it limited to subsistence in Ldn.



H.M.	Two different rates improves political presentn.  Can relate it to need.



R.A.B.	In future, Tories will need increased salaries more than Socialists.

	It is a pity that Party can’t understand this now.



B.H.	During recess feeling has certainly hardened in favour of doing as little as possible.  No straight rise – wtr salary or allowance will now be accepted.



W.	Can’t say that this plan will be well received by Tories in country.

	But they will understand it.  It is a recognised thing.

	In this form, I think we cd. quell much of trouble in country.



J.S.	Agree.  This gives best hope of getting support fr. Party.

	Wd. have to see 1922 Executive.



P.M.	Suggest L.P.S. shd. make the announcement.

	Make it general – &amp;  lay the detail in a written statement.

	I will try it on 1922 Executive.  If they accept it, I wd. consult Opposn. with RAB., L.P.S and Ch. Whip.  Seek assurances tht. they will let it go forward.  If they won’t give them, I wd. hope they wd. release us fr. going forward with anything.



R.A.B.	Do you wish to exclude x/.?



H.C.	If this were extended to Peers, allowance wd. have to be limited to Ldn.  Better to keep two Houses in line.  Agreed : limit it to Westminster duties.



H.C.	When wd. statement be made?  



P.M. 	Hope it might be Monday.



RAB.	Add reference to Junior Ministers – on basis that legn. will be needed &amp; can’t be introduced until autumn.





		5.	China. Diplomatic Relations. (resumed).



S.Ll.	A.E. wants to spk. to Chou-en-lai on basis of “Chargé d’ Affaires” – because we have always so described our man.  But will add “having same position as ours has in Pekin”.



Sal.	Shd. deprecate that if it meant that both wd. move up to higher status.

	I am concerned re effect on U.S. opinion.  If Geneva produces sole result tht. we enter upon progressively close relations with Chinese, effect on U.S. opinion wd. surely be v. bad.
