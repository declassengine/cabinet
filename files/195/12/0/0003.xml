C. 15(54)								4th March, 1954



		1.	Sudan.				[3 Service Ministers, C.O.S, B.H.

			

A.E.	Handed in draft telegram to Khartoum.

	Danger is this.  If the P.M. doesn’t give way on this &amp; disputes right to declare emergency – he might give advance orders to Police etc.,  We shd. then have to run Sudan.  SAR. heads the people who caused recent trouble, and gave the Govt. their majority : he is religious leader in competn with SAM (the Mahdi).

	Reason for our proposal.  F.O. convinced, as I am, that if we let matters drift &amp; make no stand v. E. interference – P.M. will depose the good Sudanese fr. Commn.  If we then had to act, we shd. have Commn. as well as Govt. against us.  We might be able to get Commn’s support now.  But even if we didn’t I wd. still go on with this plan – tho’ “emergency” cd. then last only 30 days, &amp; before end of that time G-Genl wd. have to try to form a new Govt.

	Objns. i) Neguib &amp; others are to be prevented fr. returning, tho’ S. Lloyd stays.

	No need to abrogate Anglo/E. Agreemt. on Sudan.  E. may denounce it if we act like this.

	But if it drifts into chaos, we can hope for no agreemt. with E. and prs. civil war in Sudan.

	

P.M.	The P.M. may take defiant course.  Or compliance + cheating – alerting his people on the sly.  Then attacking G. Genl.



A.E.	That wd. be inviting trouble from SAR &amp; others.  Doubt if he wd. do that.



Al.	Need is to get grip of situation.



A.H.	2 further battns. in M/E. at 72 hrs., coming to 24 hrs on 8/3.



P.M.	Bring them to 24 hrs. now.  Agreed.

		Cd. RAF squadrons fly in quickly?



C.A.S.		Yes – from Egypt.  1st. class airport

		Counter = 1 Battn.

		Osprey = 2nd. Battn. &amp; Fighter Bomber squadron.

		They wd. use air transport fr. Canal Zone.  Part of Rodeo move.

			Shd. we replace that from here?



P.M.		E. reaction will be no more than guerrillas.



A.E.		Or riots v. B. life &amp; property, in Cairo &amp; Alex.



A.H.		Alert air in UK to move out in support.



A.E.	Not yet.  Needn’t assume 2 opns. will have to be undertaken simultaneously.



Sal.	Advantage in provoking constitl. emergency.  Make the ultimatum even stiffer?



A.E.	Want room for manoeuvre on (b) and (c).

	Public may think sitn. is easier now rioting is over.  Wd. sooner base action on b) and c) than on a).



H.M.	Battn. strength only deployed in Palace.  Risks losing airfield.



C.A.S.	100 RAF only at airfield.  They cdn’t quarantine it.



A.H.	Cd. we bring a further battn. in after ultimatum given?



A.E.	We tell him he can ask for more, if posn. is uncertain.

	We cd. prs. give him latitude to ask for 2nd. battn. in advance of ultimatum.  Or suggest that troops be alerted, as soon as he sees P.M., so tht. they cd. fly in at once if conversation went badly &amp; emergency had to be declared.



RAB.	Not confident of Howe’s resolution in handling this.

	Moreover, para. 6 of draft allows him to offend Egypt (a) without takg. any resolute action under b) and c).

	Once we have done a), I don’t like idea of delay before b) &amp; c).



A.E.	No statutory limitn. of nos. of Br. troops.  But Govt., not Govr Genl., has right to use them to preserve order.

	Propose addn. to  para 8. on military precautions.

	Then, to counter balance that, add para. saying tht. we expect him to try hard to bring off the political coup w’out procdg. to decln. of emergency.  Not sure.  Will consider this.



H.M.	Shd. we hold back on b) and c) until we see wtr P.M. accepts a).
