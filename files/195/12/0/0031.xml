C. 42(54)							21st June, 1954



		1.	Geneva Conference.				[Enter B.H.



P.M.	Message fr. Eisenhower – do you think M. France intends to give up in Indo-China?



	Draft answer read.



A.E.	Para. 2.  Asian re-actions are more important than Geneva.  Alter order accordingly.  Agreed.

	Para. 5.  In para. 9 at end you refer again to world def. front.

	That is enough.  This cd. be omitted.



RAB.	Had hoped for relief to overseas mil. exp’re thro’ w’drawal fr. Egypt.

	When you speak to E., or here, cd. you indicate tht. in general re-deploymt we shall hope to get some redn. of exp’re.



A.E.	Not in this telegram.  But in W’ton we cd. raise ques of w’drawing or reducing in Korea.  Think we cd. get U.S. agreemt.

	Then you wd. get relief either fr. Korea or Egypt, only one of which wd. be needed to re-inforce Malaya.



Al.	No early need to re-inforce Malaya.



A.E.	Politically, I’m more anxious about it than that.  Comm. coup in Siam is quite possible, &amp; then we shd. advance to Kra Isthmus

	We shd. be able to go at short notice.



Al.	We cd. do that. And then re-inforce Malaya v. deterioration in internal order.



Sal.	End of para. 6.  More important than that.  Amendment approved.



		Message approved, subject to the above amendments.





		2.	Members’ Expenses.



R.A.B.	Majority of 1922 Executive preferred flat allowance for expenses.



P.M.	Tactics – Christ’s plan.  This has much to commend it.  Avoids it’s being presented as a Tory plan.

	Made it clear to 1922 that our position (right of decision) was reserved.



H.C.	P.M. indicated his preference for allowance plan.



R.A.B.	1922 expd. strong desire for free vote on all subsequent stages.



P.M.	I said Cabinet wd. vote for their preference, tho’ others cd. vote as they pleased.



A.E.	Shdn’t like Cab. to vote in favour of somethg. no-one else favours.

	Isn’t subsistence much easier to justify to the country?



P.M.	Shall we now consult Labour leaders on both schemes?



A.E.	Shd. we not decide which we prefer before discussing with Opposn.



R.A.B.	Shd. make it clar tht. expenses have to be justified to Revenue.

	Is not therefore a ramp.  Merely cash advance to be            [Enter H.M.

	justified later by detailed claim.



A.E.	My concern is to unite Tories.  I care less about Opposition.



P.M.	What of informal approach to Opposn.



A.E.	Not the choice.



M.F.	If offered both, they wd. choose allowances.  And I still think we can’t sell more than subsistence to our supporters in country.



W.	Don’t favour delay in decision.  Regarded as incapable of decision.  Also unpopularity will grow with delay.



J.S.	Sure we can’t get our supporters to accept more than subsistence.



W.	That is my view too.



B.H.	I believe that is true of supporters in H/C. also.

	Some of 1922 Executive, thro’ preferring allowance, think it easier to get subsistence approved by followers in H/C. &amp; in country.



R.A.B.	I still think allowances is better &amp; more acceptable to House as a whole.



P.M.	Subsistence plan will be accepted by Opposn. but abused.



M.P.	Christ plan.  Can’t have free vote if we agree on a plan with Opposn.

	Or, if you do risk its being carried by Cabinet &amp; Opposition.



RAB.	Ldn. Members won’t like subsistence.



J.S.	But they don’t have such large expenses.



A.E.	Is it case tht. whatever plan we propose, majority of Tories won’t vote for it.



	Agreed.  Then, ques is which will carry most support among Tories in country.



P.M.	There is also ques of preserving reasonable atmosphere in H/C as whole.



H.M.	H/C. voted for salary increase.  We bein with that.  Cd. we announce that this is impossible at this time.

	Then, on contn. to expenses : we cd. offer to discuss that with Opposn. before we decide.

	Then, I wd. put to them only subsistence plan.  If they reject that, ask what they wd. propose.

	This wd. make it clear to public tht. we won’t raise salaries.



Sal.	Won’t this lead to allowances – wh. Socialists wd. prefer.

	You can’t offer to negotiate if you aren’t willing to consider their alternative.



H.M.	Then prs. it is better to decide on our own plan.



A.E.	Believe it’s dangerous to negotiate at this stage.  Prefer to make up our own minds.  



H.M. 	That is what I would prefer.



A.E.	R.A.B. is saying we can’t get anything thro’ save with Labour votes.



Sw.	Will Labour reject our plan when they know it’s all they can get?

	They won’t vote it down then.



P.M.	But they will abuse it – &amp; be bitter in opposition generally.



O.L.	They won’t get much out of such criticisms in the country.



            x|	[We shd. say  i) no salary increase  ii) we have a scheme for alleviating hardship] (subsistence) &amp; if Oppn. support it we will bring it in.



P.M.	Shall I see CRA., HM., WW. with Cl. Davies., &amp; put that to them?



A.E.	Then they will bargain.  



P.M. 	First talk with them cd. be confidential.



H.M.	Let us see draft statement on x/.  Then consider wtr we tell Oppn. in confidence before we make public statement.



R.A.B.	Cd. we say only [   ] at present : adding we will discuss with Opposn.

	Talks after P.M.’s return.  



H.M. 	Negotiate only w’in Scheme A.
