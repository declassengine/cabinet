P.M.	Shd. take stock of situation.

	Authies. on spot have had every chance to ask for re-inforcements.  They, being in greatest danger, can be heeded if they say they are content to go w’out them.

	Neguib is said to have another appointmt. in Cairo on 10/3.  Assumed therefore tht. he won’t return to Khartoum for opening of Parlt.

	ii)	if Govt. try to change composn. of Commn. on 15/3.

	Pakistani Chairman of Commn. has received firm message fr. Zafrullah. Text read.  V. good for the record if worst happens.  Believe Sudan Govt. will make some attempt to change repn.

	S.Ll. will return to-morrow.



P.M.	C.I.G.S. telegram suggested it might be worse.  However, authies. on spot are not as anxious.

	8 Hastings aircraft have bn. sent out fr. U.K. to Canal Zone.  They can fly direct from there to Khartoum.

	Cd. we bring up to strength the battn. now in K.



A.H.	It is up to strength at that establishment (about 600).
