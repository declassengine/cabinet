C. 67(54)							16th October, 1954



		Industrial Disputes. Docks.			[Enter B-C., Maudling



W.M.	All agree that a port can’t be worked w’out overtime.  Moreover, no diffty. in securing flexibility so as to avoid individual hardship.

	Barrett is Communist and R.C.  Rest of his Union leaders are Communists.

	Discussion of y’day.  Expld. tht. we had tried conciliation on this issue, particularly in Feby. : gravity of consequences incldg., long-term, unemplt in other industries.  Analysed issues : they agreed vol. overtime was issue : they admitted tht. some overtime is necessary : employers ready to discuss all grievances, incldg. way overtime is worked, once ban on overtime is lifted.  But Stevedores were adamant.  I then said “there is no basis for conference or conciliation”.  I must therefore consider ct. of enquiry – for infn. of Parlt. &amp; public – investigate causes &amp; circs. of dispute.  I did not offer this as bargain with Stevedores to go back to work : I asked if they wd. attend the court : and I asked wtr they wdn’t return to work on pre-strike condns., as an appeal.  One issue is overtime : you won’t be working it : therefore won’t prejudice yr. position.  They declined appeal &amp; said they wd. advise their men to reject it.  Won’t go back until employers admit tht. overtime is voluntary.

	Spoken to Deakin (B’ham).  Press have not put Stevedores posn. clearly viz., tht. they have chance to return to work w’out prejudicing their posn.  Deakin will make this point in a speech to-night : and I am putting it to Sunday Press.



	Spoken also to Tewson, warning him tht. this is threat to Unions’ authority – by Communists working on Left opinion amount Union members.  He agrees.  Will take chances of rallying on this when Court begins.  Tewson is on Bd. of D. Herald.



P.M.	Gravity of posn. is now reflected in Press.



W.M.	Yes : &amp; I don’t want to say more at this stage.  Prefer that Press shd. say any more about Communist influence.



	Bus Strike.



W.M.	Same Union. Improvemt. might therefore help with docks.

	Delegate mtg. on Monday fr. depots.  Union will do utmost to get them back.  May get agreemt. thro’ w’drawing emergency schedules &amp; relying on local arrangements.  



B.C. 	12 garages voted to stay in y’day.  About 50% of buses are running.

 

	Docks (resumed).



W.M.	Composn. of ct. of enquiry will be announced to-day.

	Spread.  Efforts are being made to spread it, to other ports.



P.M.	What evidence of Comm. inspiration?  



W.M. 	M.I.5 reports.



B.C.	Open C.P. support (pamphlets) for bus strike.



H.M.	Troops : used first for essentials of life? – not for exports etc. }

									   } *

A.E.	Yes : tho’ preserve liberty later to extend their use.		   }
