C. 29(54)							15th April, 1954



		1.	Hong-Kong.			[Enter C.O.S., 3 Serv. Min., B-C.



A.E.	Nothing shd. operate until after Geneva.

	Nothing shd. be said to U.S., m’while.  It wd. sink prospect of S.E.A. N.A.T.O.



P.M.	No communication to mil. units.

	No answer to Govr.’s telegram.



Al.	Better tell Govr. there is stand still until after Geneva – m’while we shd. say nothing.



		Agreed.





		2.	Egypt.



A.E.	If we abandon full Rodeo, incldg. Alexandria, it weakens our authority in E.  The E. Govt. know of Rodeo plan.  Sitn. mght arise in which we wd. have a chance to put in a new Govt. &amp; support it.

	If therefore flying column is 1st. step, I shd. like to see some backing behind it : if situation suggests we need it &amp; cd. exploit sitn. to our advantage.



P.M.	Br. troops won’t be re-inforced.  They must do what they can with what they have.



Al.	Rodeo/Flail was planned 2 yrs ago.  Mil. sitn. has altered.  Much stiffer opposn. must now be expected.

	Suggest M/E Commrs. shd. now consider what is best plan they can make with forces available.



C.I.G.S.	We suggested a change in present concept in order to start reducing our forces in M/E  If we have to remain respons. for going in to C. &amp; A. to m’tain order, we can’t reduce : &amp; if we had to stay for long we shd. have to re-inforce.  It is a v. big job.

	We were seekg. alternative opn. which we cd. do with fewer troops.

	We therefore suggd. rescue opn. vice occupn. opn.



P.M.	If our troops have bn. re-deployed and there is trouble then, we can’t guarantee Br. lives.



A.H.	We have bn. told to study redeploymt. before agreemt.  If we begin it, we can’t do Rodeo.



P.M.	What Br. troops can do will depend on circs. at time.



C.I.G.S.	Will turn mainly on wtr we are asked to control C. &amp; Alex. for some time.  That is the bigger task.



A.E.	Ask for latitude to make best use of troops available – not limit ourselves now to rescue operation.



P.M.	A no. of alternative plans can be prepared – decision to be taken according to circs.



A.H.	If we are to be sure of having troops for all contingencies, we can’t begin to redeploy in advance of agreemt.



Al.	Don’t stop contraction of Base m’while.

	Let us have plans to use such troops as are available when emergency crisis.



CIGS	Principle : scope of opn. wd. be related to forces available at material time.



		Agreed :  but no actual w’drawal w’out further Cab. authority.



P.M.	Hope SEA pact may be precedent for M.E.D.O. also including U.S.

	That wd. give us prestige cover to w’draw from E.

	Shd. we not take that up now?  With U.S.  It involves neither financial nor mil. support fr. U.S.



A.E.	If it were purely U.S./U.K., it wdn’t be like S.E.A. model.

	No other Powers ready to come in in M/E.



P.M.	Canal Powers cd. be associated with it.

	U.S. have given us chance now for U.K./U.S. initiative.  Over SEA they have for first time suggested preliny. bi-lateral agreement, even w’out French.  This is the vital new factor.



						[Exit C.O.S. &amp; Serv. Min.

						[Enter D.E.

		3.	Civil Defence.



		Revision of Plans Generally.



M.F.	i) General anxiety  ii) Coventry   iii) Times &amp; Tribune : Govt. is not doing much more than Coventry.  I must answer these.

	C.D. Cttee. have discussed my draft.  Want Cabinet to know the line I am taking.



P.M.	Arrangemts. will always be needed for survivors round edges.



M.F.	Must continue local recruitment : go on with mobile column : revise plans for evacuation &amp; care of homeless.



P.M.	Structural  protn. is main thing which has now bn. discredited.



Sal.	More emphasis on improved outlets from large cities.  Boost for trunk roads.  



M.F.  	Am discussing with M/T.



Sal.	Add to para 7 a fourth : removal of causes of war.



A.E.	Yes : wish to make suggns. on this and para. 6.



H.C.	Para.16 was new to me.  Didn’t know they wd. be used on C.D. in War.  



M.F. 	Because these will not be needed by RAF in opening phase of 12 mos. of war.  



Sw.  	Add : “until they are needed in R.A.F.”.



	Shelters in Buildings.



D.E.	As in memo.  Addl. cost is 7%.  May I quietly drop the attempt at persuasion?



M.F.	Try to persuade.  If that fails, give the licence.  Make no public re-cantation.  Slide out of this quietly.  Cool off.



							[Exit D.E.

		4.	G.A.T.T.				[Enter Maudling, Nugent.



P.T.	As in memo.



		Approved.				[Exit M. &amp; N.





		5.	Sexual Offences.



H.M.	Balance of argument is v. restn. of reporting.  Esp. difficult to define what offences because of sexual element in so many crimes of violence.

	Wd. also appear tht. we were seeking to distract attentn. fr. scandal.

	Our R. Commn. criticism : I now propose Dpl. Cttee. instead.

	Can’t take any action on prostn. w’out independent enquiry.



Sal.	Winterton has now tabled his Motion again for mid-May.  Need to be able to announce somethg definite then.



J.S.	I cdn’t keep out – tho’ my problem is less acute.



P.M.	Cabinet shd. not interfere with your wishes, on Dpl. 	Cttee.  



M.F. 	Will submit names &amp; t. of r. to P.M.





		6.	Malta.



O.L.	Is it any good pursuing idea of Maltese repn. at W’minster.  I think it inconceivable.  But we reject Dom. Status.  They reject I. of M. status.  We may therefore be driven to R. Commn. – wh. is dangerous.



M.F.	Olivier wants Dom. status.  Doms. wdn’t concede that.

	Mintoff wants integration with U.K. – for economic reasons.  He impressed M.P.’s while here.  If we must resist that, we shan’t get any agreemt. with Malta.



O.L.	Labour Party deputn. to me showed no enthusiasm for repn. at W’minster – or for carrying M.’s surplus popn. on our social services.  [They have 75,000 more than Island can support].

	Fear we may be forced into R. Commn.



Sw.	2-tier system to open to gt. practical objn.  That strengthens Cab decn. tht. Malta can’t be transferred to C.R.O.

	Danger of R. Commn. is ¨what will it report?  As practical alternatives are all rejected, it may recommend solution impossible to carry out.



O.L.	Their real object is to get our money.



Sw.	Can we look at it again when discns. have reached deadlock?



O.L.	Yes : neither M.F. nor O.L. like R. Commn.



P.M.	It is not impossible to say No.

							[Exit Al., A.E.



		7.	Malaya : Constitution of Singapore.



O.L.	Indian resident in Singapore not recognised as Indian citizen, wd. (?) not be U.K. &amp; Col.  But if India passed its citizenship Act they cd. enfranchise themselves by becoming U.K. &amp; Col. citizens. – on declaration after 1 yrs’ residence.



Sw.	Difficult Comm. points : but despite them I support O.L.  Need for a local loyalty over-rides, in multi-racial place like this.

	India wd. have no cause to complain.  But other Doms. normally have right to vote – and 500 or so Australians in S. wd. under this lose right to vote.  Wd. like chance to consider that – tho’ I still think we must support general plan.



		Approved in principle subject to C.R.O. considn. of

		Australian ques.
