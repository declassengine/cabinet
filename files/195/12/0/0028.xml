C. 39(54)							5th June, 1954



		1.	Indo-China.					[Enter B.H.



A.E.	Gloomy picture.  Elements of Gk. tragedy – most of action off stage &amp; reported in the play.

	Elements in sitn. – 	i)  Fr. uncertainties.  Even chance Govt. may fall next week.  No successor Govt. likely to be willing to continue struggle in I/Ch.  Not worse prs. than present sitn., when Fr. won’t get down to real negotns. &amp; suffer continuing indecision.

				Last wk. got mil. repves. to meet.  But so far Fr. have made no advance on proposals 5 mos. old.

				ii) China.    Real fear of U.S., whom they believe to have aggressive intentns. in S.E.A.

				cf. Laos &amp; Cambodia.  I believe you cd. make them safe &amp; neutral – if no-one went in there.  But to defend Siam you shd. defend line of plateau running thro’ Laos.  Any U.S. attempt to assume mil. line forward of Siam will cause Ch. re-action.

	On other hand U.S. unlikely to accept real neutrality.

				iii) U.S.    Bedell Smith is under v. tight rein.

	Many in U.S. who admit they never wanted Geneva Conference and wd. quite like to see if fail.

				Large sections of U.S. opinion are now interested only in intervention.  Lodge, in convn. with Dixon.  Mil. convns. at Geneva.  If we fail at Geneva, U.S. likely to seek U.N. cover for interventn. in Laos &amp; Cambodia.  U.S. are trying to widen basis of Siam’s approach to U.N.

				Very close support from old Doms. esp. Canada.

	Am I to play the hand as now?  I am only repve. who sees Communists.

		i)  Because Mol. &amp; I are joint Chairmen &amp; there is no 	Secretariat.  We have to arrange the business.

		ii) Need to explain motives directly to Chinese, not always

thro’ Molotov.

	Risk of this is being represented in U.S. as “appeaser”.  And it is played up by our left-wing Press.  Concerned at effect on U.K. posn. &amp; Anglo-U.S. relations.



P.M.	It wd. be intolerable if world security were endangered by inhibitions on contacts with other side.  Shd. not be deterred by misrepresentn.

	Continue in present methods.  Duration is more dangerous than method.



	Cabinet approved continuance of A.E.’s method.



A.E.	Trevelyan, h’to unrecognised in Peking, is now in touch with Chinese &amp; various outstandg. issues are being resolved – e.g. release of Br. prs.  We are now doing this too on behalf of U.S.

	Have given Chou-en-lai a chance to send repve. to Ldn. – &amp; unluckily he has jumped at it.  Awkward moment for this.

	They will want to send someone.  He cd. be., as our man is, charged only with duty of organising recognition.



P.M.	Don’t connect it with success or failure of Conference.

	Find a means of deferring it for a time – e.g. wait until Geneva is over.



A.E.	They have agreed to our re-opening Cons. Genl. in Shanghai.

	They also propose visit to U.K. of vice-Minister for Trade.  I said Govt. wdn’t invite.  They wd. take an invitn. instead fr. F.B.I. 

	Think I had better stall on that – because of Anglo/U.S. relations.

	Will say it wd. be more profitable after visit of private Trade Mission.





		2.	Anglo-U.S. Relations :   Proposed Visit to Washington.



P.M.	Telegram 22/4 to Eisenhower proposing I shd. visit W’ton.

	Reply welcoming visit : 24/4.

	Read subsequent correspondence – in part of which E. foreshadowed willingness to open up discns. on developmt. of H. bomb.  Vitally important not to miss that opportunity.

	Final plan, as agreed with E., – go on 18/6 (leaving on evening of 17/6) with A.E. to talk to Dulles.

	Importance	}  -	i)  exploit his readiness to talk on Atomics.

	in my view.	}	ii) our need of their help in extricatg. ourselves

				from Egypt.

	Since then, Geneva has lagged.  A.E. uncertain wtr he can make this date.  But I am anxious not to miss this date.



A.E.	I think P.M. shd. go – basis of personal friendship.  Presence of For. Secretaries mght make things more formal.

	Cdn’t go if Geneva continuing.  Wd. look as tho’ I was obeying U.S. orders.

	Anyway, I wd. like to see H/C.

	Only risk is tht. surge for U.S. intervention in I/China may arise when you are there.





		1.	Indo-China (cont’d.).



A.E.	Read summary.

	Farcical.  Based on sitn. wh. is most unlikely to arise.  Ch. will not intervene by air in Viet Nam.

	Fits in with B. Smith’s view that sitn. in I/China can’t be restored w’out ground forces.

	Encouraging – because unlikely to happen.  But mustn’t have it publd. while Geneva continues.  Tho’ after failure we cd. under-write that.  Seems that they are coming nearer to us.



P.M.	Yes – consistent with SEATO – to wh. Malaya (re-inforced) wd. be our contn.

	If Hanoi fell, &amp; U.S. intervened in I/China, we cd. support by re-inforcing Malaya.



A.E.	Risk is tht. U.S. haven’t much right to intervene in these countries.

	U.S. humbug – they haven’t told Fr. tht. they won’t intervene. &amp; tht. they shd. conclude best agreemt. they can get.

	Fr. are being led on to persist by U.S. hints of interventn. wh. are unreal.





		2.	P.M.’s Visit to Washington. (cont’d)



Sal.	Concerned tht. A.E. shd. not accompany P.M. to W’ton.

	I/China is sure to be raised &amp; D. will put his view.  Gt. pity A.E. shdn’t be there to handle it.

	If he can possibly leave Geneva, he shd. go.



P.M.	I accept that.

	Let it stand tht. we have both promised to come – if A.E. can’t because of Geneva I must go alone.



H.C.	Shdn’t visit be p’poned until A.E. can go too?



A.E.	E. hasn’t many free dates.

	Seems likely that Hanoi will fall about 20/6.

	Diffy. is tht. if we suggest p’ponemt. we mayn’t get another date.



P.M.	Let it stand as arranged – for another week.

	Wd. like to announce at end of Recess.



O.L.	If you go, at moment of Geneva’s failure, in company with Cherwell public will assume you are going to discuss atomic interventn. in I/China.



P.M.  	Cabinet cd. meet on pm. of 14/6 and take final decn.





		1.	Indo-China (cont’d.).



R.A.B.	Message fr. Secy. of U.S. Treasury.  Only member of U.S. Cabinet who had stood out in support of U.K. policy was Eisenhower – who took line tht. “we can’t go in w’out U.K.”  A message on Thurs. relating to a U.S. Cabinet a week or so before.





		3.	Saudi Arabia.



A.E.	If Aramco. stay, it may cost us hundreds of millions.  U.S. Govt. don’t support them.



P.M.	I’m shy of firing when U.S. lives may be lost.  Might enflame U.S. opinion.



A.E.	My instruction was carefully weighed.  Is it unsafe?

	May I try for some compromise betwn. my view &amp; yours.



P.M.	Overwhelming force wd. be safer.  13 against 100 is unsafe.



A.E.	Prs. you shd. send message to Eis..  He must call them off.



		M/State will submit alternative, incldg. message to Eisenhower.





		4.	Expenses of Members.



P.M.	Drew attention to H. Morrison’s statement – sharing responsibility for any increase.



R.A.B.	Still believe straight increase will cause least pol. diffy. in the end.

	If that isn’t accepted, my alternative is as circulated.

	We ought to accept decn. of H/C. in principle.  My suggn. does.

	It gives £1,500 – but in two parts &amp; by degrees.  Expenses at once, salary increase later.

	I am not in favour of having this discussed at next Election.



P.M.	I also believe best thing to do wd. be to ram it through.

	We can’t command majority for another course.

	If we put positive alternative proposal, whole responsibility for that will be ours.  Shall have no support from Opposition.

	I agree that we have the option.  Not bound by free vote.

	But prefer to choose method of salary increase – and allow a free vote.



H.C.	Morrison’s statement doesn’t assume we shall give effect to vote.

	Trouble in Party runs even deeper than I thght previously.

	Have considered, with Ch. Whip, compromise wh. gives all Members something &amp; is therefore likely to be accepted by Labour.

	No proposal involvg. any increase of salary will be acceptable to Tories.

	Have therefore considered “London subsistence allowance” available to all to draw at their will.  Can trust M.P.’s not to claim improperly when not in fact in attendance.  Case for giving London Members something – suggest a lower rate for them.  Defined already by Revenue.

	Canvassed opinion discreetly – reason to think Party wd. accept.

	It wd. benefit poorest w’out forcing advantage on richer.

	Any element of salary increase wd. cause gt. diffies. in Party.

	This wd. be temporary.  Might never be necessary to tackle salaries.



M.F.	Support this plan.

	P.M. hasn’t realised shock to Party of our apparent readiness to increase M.P.’s salaries before o.a.p. &amp; w’out regard to affect on wages.

	Gtest. shock to Party in 25 years.

	Can’t keep Party together on any flat increase.



P.M.	Baldwin’s last act in H/C. was 50% increase (£400-£600) when 1½ m. unemployed.  Carried by a free vote.  And without the support of a Select Cttee.

	But I am willing to accept compromise.  That wd. be consistent with my earlier statements.

	Many of our people won’t like compromise either.



M.F.	Not only tactics.  We have always said we were against salary increase.



W.	Believe Party wd. accept the compromise.

	Strong point in tht. no Member need take it.



R.A.B.	M.P.’s are already claiming v. high living expenses v. tax.  As a result, they won’t get more than about £150 out of subsistence allowances.

	But I agree tht. it wd. benefit poorer more than richer.

	Wd. sooner not base it on “subsistence”.



A.E.	Better understood in country on basis of subsistence.



R.A.B.	Then at least a block subsistence, not by days.



A.E.	Usually best thing is to go thro’, in a mess.

	But on this ques what matters is, not Press comment but action of supporters in constituencies in w’drawing their support.



B.H.	Any salary increase wd. be rejected by our supporters in H/C.

	A subsistence scheme wd. be accepted.

	Even Henry Brooke (member of Sel. Cttee) now accepts that view.



H.M.	Let us tackle immediate problem on basis of subsistence allowance.

	And take more time to consider what we say on principle of long-term salary position.	

							[Exit Simonds.



P.M.	Discuss at next Cabinet.  Reflect m’while.



RAB. 	Takg. a/c of L.P.S. view tht. any salary increase wd. be rejected.  I will consult with L.P.S. &amp; others on 14/6.





		5.	Housing Subsidies.



H.M.	Bank rate has bn. reduced – &amp; so, now, has P. Works Loans rate.

	As l.a.’s can now borrow more cheaply, rate of subsidy shd. be reduced.

	Wd. save at least £1M. p.a. for 60 years on all new houses.

	Leaves open main ques of subsidies.

	Shall have to bargain with l.a.’s.

	Hope Scotland can also make a token reduction.



R.A.B.	Fully support this proposal.



J.S.	Can’t easily act in advance of rpt. of Thorn Cttee.  V. awkward for me.



R.A.B.	Sc. subsidy is £950 cpd. with £600 in E. &amp; Wales.

	Urge J.S. to look at it again.



		Let us go ahead in E. &amp; W. alone.

		Invite J.S. to consider again wtr he can do anything in 	Scotland in advance of Thorn report.



H.M.	He might reserve right to alter before end/financial year, on receipt of Thorn report.





		6.	European Coal &amp; Steel Community.



R.A.B.	Unfair to Monnet.



Sw.	But tariff wd. take 6 mos. to agree.  Must give Monnet something.

	Can’t give him common market or tariff.  Therefore, offer him assocn. &amp; go along in that with discn. of principles.



R.A.B.	Will discuss with D.S. on his return.
