C. 68(54)							20th October, 1954



		1.	Industrial Disputes.		[Enter J.B-C., Noble., Reading., 							 P.B-H.



P.M.	Have advised Queen not to go into dock area during visit to L’pool.



Ll.G.	So’ton.  Dockers are out : tugmen are still at work.  But they are likely to be out to-morrow a.m.  Shd. a naval tug be used to work Q.E. out?



W.M.	Do not oppose their use.



A.N.	One at P’smouth : one can come from Falmouth.



		Agreed :	Naval tugs be used, if need be.

				No announcemt. re L’pl. visit.  tho’ if point is

 				raised it may be said arrangemts. were altered on 			advice.

								[Exit Noble.



W.M.	So’ton at 9.30 a.m. decided to come out. Outlook there is gloomy.

	This is prob. peak : shall know in 2 days or so which way it will go.

	Ct. of Enquiry is sitting.  Want to avoid mil. labour until after week-end.  Fri. pay-packets will be short, &amp; there may be disposn. over week-end to go back to work.

	Risk of spread if troops used – Smithfield, tankers – even rlways (Dover).  Wd. begin to look more like 1926 – but gt. diffce. is tht. T.U.C. are with Govt.



P.M.	Don’t shrink from using troops, when required.



W.M.	Am collectg. all evce. available to show Comm. influence.  Wd. like to publish Wh. Paper, after strike, on model of that publd. when Canadians provoked dock strike.





		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Will announce prorogation during wk. beginning 22/11. ; and New Session of 30/11.





		3.	Remuneration of Ministers.



R.A.B.	Have said (13/5) it is clear tht. Junior Ministers’ salaries need early attention.  Later (June) said, not before recess.  But impn. given that we shall do it in autumn.

	When does Cabinet think it wd. be opportune to do it?

	Scheme : payment of Parly. salary to all wd. avoid situation in which M/State got more than senior Ministers.



P.M.	Cd. not first £1.200 or so of Ministers’ salaries be counted as Parly. salary, so that expenses cd. be charged against it.



H.C.	Diffce. betwn. Ministers in Lords and Commons.



RAB	H/C Ministers have expenses as M.P.’s.



P.M.	Let the salary revert to £5.000 after the 3 years., automatically.

	Tho’ it will need to be announced.   6/11/54.         Agreed.



R.A.B.	If you approve Parly. salaries for Juniors, you must add it up the scale  otherwise relativities will be upset.

	Wd. wish A.E. to be consulted before we decide.

	Suggest Opposn. Leaders be consulted after Cab. decision.

	Then we mght. announce it wd. be done in next Parlt.



P.M.	Need we delay so long?



W.	O.a.p. – they won’t become effective until next summer.



O.P.	Will be criticism if this is done before o.a.p. decn. is at any rate announced – December.



	Pensioners are accustomed to 6 months’ delay betwn. announcemt. &amp; effect.  N. Assistce. is more generous than at any time during Labour Govt : no hardship save among those who won’t go to N.A.



R.A.B.	1) Draft announcemt. re £5.000.

	2) Let me consult A.E. on this scheme.

	3) Consider timing of action.



H.C.	Wd. it be wise to get 2 outside people to recommend proper level of salaries?  V. awkward for Ministers to decide own salaries.

	Wd. like to reflect on this.



P.M.	Cd. bring Opposn. in.



A.L.B.	Better to treat first £1000 of salary for H/C. Ministers as Parly. salary. rather than add Parly. salary to the Ministerial salary.  This avoids diffce. betwn. Ministers in H/L. and H/C.





		4.	Expenses of Peers.



Sal.	No Peer in any Party wants a salary.  But some expense allowce. must be introduced if Peers are to continue to attend.  They get rlway fares, but other cost of attendance may be £10-12 p. week.

	Therefore, they can’t come ; &amp; Labour Oppn. grows weaker and weaker.

	This applies to Peers belonging to other Parties too.

	How much?  Discussed with Tory Peers, &amp; obtained Labour views.

	There is genl. feeling tht. allowance shd. be £3 a day, wtr or not they live in Ldn.  H/L. sits about 100 days, &amp; about 60 now attend.  Even if you had 100% attendance of 100 Peers it wd. cost only £30,000 p.a.

	Timing wd. need thought.  Not before Dec. announcemt. re o.a.p.

	Wd. be valuable to synchronise with increase of Ministers’ salaries.



P.M.	Pl. circulate memo. on this ques – wh. we can no longer ignore.



R.A.B.	No objn. on grounds of cost to Exchequer.

	Diffy. is only i) political  ii) wtr it shd. be attendance or subsistence.

	I prefer the first.  Expenses (of 50% average) wd. be chargeable, but rest wd. be liable to tax.

	Will discuss with Saly.



P.M.  	Cabinet to consider in 2/3 weeks’ time.





		5.	Legislative Programme.		[Enter Att.G., Maclean.

	

H.C.	Ready to discuss with a few colleagues, if you prefer.

	Concerned about  i) pol. diffy. of some of these Bills.

			    ii) need for more leisure for Members.

	Some diff. ques e.g. Teachers’ Superannuation.  Does RAB, or new M/ED., still think this must pass before end of fin. year.



P.M.	Aim at minimum of legn.  Cut Dpl. Bills.  Give Members leisure.

	Tho’ we cd. defer the Election until ’56.



H.M.	Minister can fix date on wh. new valuation comes into force.  I fixed (March) a date in 1955.  There were reasons warranting that p’ponement.

	In March next an Order cd. be made deferring it to ’56.  But you wd. need to justify that.  Before the date, legn. will have it passed re some natd. industries &amp; machinery for appeals.

	The Bill wd. come in later in Session : &amp; you cd. justify p’ponement on ground that Bill had not yet passed.



P.M.	Gt. advantage to AE, as P.M., to have an option open for a later Election.

	Teachers’ Superannuation.  New M/Ed. shd. submit memo. on this.



P.T.	Copyright Bill.  P.M.G. wants it for B.B.C.  The I.T.A.











	Emergency Powers.



K.	Our supporters in H/C. won’t like this plan of not legislating to suppress D.R. 55.  We can meet that risk.  We can’t do less, as P.T. (un-heard) has suggd.

	A no. of Bills (para. 8) aimed at other Regns.  Pol. diffy. in both Houses if we lose momentum on this.  Hope therefore prepn. of these Bills may go fwd. so that they cd. go in if time becomes available.

	V. disappointed at failure of project to dismantle whole apparatus of emergency powers.



H.C.	I wd. like to give it a good priority.



P.M.	Let this be reviewed by a Cttee.  H.C. (Chair), Sal., K., R.A.B., J.S., H.M., and Ch. Whip.  If A.E. cd. spare the time, he cd. preside but I doubt if he cd.



								Agreed.





		6.	Parliament.  Queen’s Speeches.



P.M.	Suggest appointment of Cttee.    Agreed.

								[Exit B.H.



		7.	Civil Defence.



Ll.G.	Criticism in H/L. that RAF. reservist plan was not enough.  The propd. W. Paper will make it seem even more inadequate.  May I be authorised to say a little more?  Have prepd. a draft – saying powers will be available &amp; that we are considering plans for extended use of them.



M.F.	I consulted Alex.  He agreed in principle.  I agree tht. we shd. say RAF is first step and we are considering makg. further use of the powers.

	All recent apprecns. assume tht. T.A. will be used in support of C.D.

	This will be raised by Wh. Paper, due to follow v. soon.



P.M.	This wd. be a v. isolated step, against a v. gt. danger.



H.M.	Bill arose because RAF reservists were available, &amp; it was found that no powers were available.  Shd. it not be defended on latter ground, &amp; little be said re R.A.F.  Keep it at low level.

	May I discuss terms of statement with Ll.G.?



R.A.B.	Agree with H.M.  Don’t go further than necessary.  Want to know cost of training further men.



		Agreed :  wording to be settled by M/D. H.O. and Ty.



		8.	Japan and G.A.T.T..				[Exit Maclean



P.T.	We have industrial &amp; Party support for G.A.T.T.  But that wd. soon be undermined if Japan became full member.  I agree with F.O. we shd. not contract out re Japan altogether.  If not, we must have safeguards i) power to take em. action v. flood of J. imports ii) provn. re other Comm. countries wh. have higher tariff v. Japan.

	Wd. like to put these proposals to Japan, as only alternative to contracting out.  Also press them on U.S. Govt.

	If these fail, we must fall back on Art. 35.



A.L.B.	Support P.T.  The pol. storm cd. not be ridden w’out this provn. for a bilaterial agreement.



R.	Internatl. issue also at stake – whole future of Japan.  Content with course proposed by P.T.  But don’t want to confront J. with ultimatum. Want to get Japan into international bodies.  Can agree on terms of aide-memoire with B/T., omitting refce. to Art. 35.



R.A.B.	Agree with P.T.  But needn’t confront Yoshida at outset with Art. 35.  Effect on payments, shipping etc.,



P.T.	They will never accept our proposals unless they know Art 35 is only alternative.  No other alternative wd. suffice for us.

	Want it on record here tht. Art.35 is only alternative.



RAB.	Don’t dissent.  But don’t play that card too soon.



P.T.	Can’t negotiate at Geneva w’out Japs knowing that this is our only alternative.  	

Do Cab. agree tht. Art. 35 is only alternative.



P.M.	Don’t play this card too soon.

	Press our positive proposals.
