	Am exploring this p.m. means of getting settlement on meat sorting.

	No use of troops until we see re-action to Interim Rpt.

	And, when they are used, introduce them for “essential services” &amp; use them thereafter quietly for unloading specified cargoes.  Not for loading, which wd. prob. bring seamen out.



Ll.G.	No shortage of supplies (food or oil) before beginning of next week.  Diffies. over refuse are being overcome.

	Mails – congestion will mean tht. acceptances will have to be curtailed.

A.L.B.	Tel. from Govr. foreshadowing another weeks’ delay before Court’s judgment is given.  Govr. wishes to come home for consultns. &amp; I have agreed.



Sw.	Glad Cab. are disposed to follow Court’s finding, rather than reverse earlier decision on pol. grounds alone.  Latter course wd. make my posn. re Seretse untenable.

D.S.	Details agreed with Monnet on Saty.  Few changes cpd. with documents prev. submd. to Cabinet.  Dpts. concerned, accept the texts.  Industries consulted.

	Diplomatic immunity.  Not part of my agreemt.  Wd. have arisen in any case.  Our delegn. in L’burg have enjoyed immunity for 2 yrs’ past.

	diff. therefore to deny reciprocity – tho’ H/C. are sensitive.



R.	A.E. has considered &amp; agreed.



P.M.	Fact tht. we accepted it makes it exceptional.  This is no ordinary extension.



D.S.	Community got L’burg to extend the immunities to Delegations.



H.C.	V. discouraging qua Legve. P’mme. because this will be resented by our side of  H/C.  Need we do it?
