C. 71(54)							28th October, 1954



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter B.H.



H.C.	F. affairs debate.  Oppn. leaders don’t want to discuss S.E.A. because of their differences with Left.  They want it limited to M/E. (Persia and Middle East).

	Debate on Germany in 3rd. week from now – beginning 14th.  On affirmative resoln.  Opposn. want time to get their people together.



A.E.	Don’t want to lose momentum.



Sal.	Must leave time for debate thereafter in H/L.



B.H.	There wd. be one more week.



		Agreed :  H/C. 17th.  H/L. 24th.





		2.	Overseas Information Services.



		RAB. &amp; A.E. to discuss à deux.





		3.	Economic Controls.



H.C.	Instead of legn., wh. wd. be complex &amp; controversial, now proposed to make Order cutting down D.R. 55.

	Only alternative wd. be no action : &amp;then we shd. not avoid controversial debate, for it wd. arise on renewal of D.R. 55.



K.	I agree.  So does Ll.G.



P.T.	I expd. doubts.  There will be controversy.  Can’t claim tht. Order removes chance of Labour reviving full 55.  Order draws attentn. to its current use – more than renewal of full 55.  And at awkward moment. e.g. when U.S. are discussing strategic controls with us here.



A.E.	On balance, Cttee. thght it better to go forward.



D.S.	Might we not wish to revive some?  If not, cd. we not legislate.



		Memo. approved.

							[Enter J.B.C., W. Digby.



		4.	East-West Trade.



P.T.	Seek authy. to dissent from proposed U.S. plan.



H.M.	Can’t accept i) concession to Danes  ii) low tonnage from Br. s’bldg.

P.M.	No harm in selling ships to R.



H.M.	We can’t afford to agree to sale of faster ships.  



W.D. 	supported this.



P.M.	Prefer R. to increase naval rather than air strength.



P.T.	Para. 15 alternative.  Can we defend exmptn. for Danes?



A.E.	Choice :    	disappoint our industry &amp; hamper our exports 

     	be alone in an ugly row with U.S. – prs. imperilling  chance 

	of getting revision of Chinese embargo.

	Cd. we accept it for one year &amp; then look at it afresh.



J.B.C.	Shipping cos. interest.



A.E.	Cd. we try again to persuade U.S.?



P.T.	Cd. try §15 on U.S.A.  Doubt if we can get out of promise to Danes.



W.D.	Admy. would support that.



		Agreed : F.O., B/T., &amp; M/D. to concert fresh approach to

			  U.S. on basis of para. 15.



Sw.	Might get some Canadian support.

							[Exit W. Digby.



		5.	Scottish Affairs.



J.S.	Findings of R. Commn.  Not v. startling.  Better accept them.

	Hope P.M. will make the announcement.



R.A.B.	Snap it up quick.

								[Enter Ll.G.

		Agreed.  P.M. to announce.

							



		6.	Dock Strike.



W.M.	Some signs of improvement.  Moderate line by D.Worker.  M.P.’s for docks tell me tht. but for pickets men wd. return.

	Stevedores &amp; employers have bn. at M/L.  Agreed on formula.

	Men will go back Monday : negotiations at once on overtime : employers won’t “report” men m’while.  If Barrett gets this thro’ his Executive, it’s a win.  If he doesn’t, employers will publish it &amp; that may crack the strike.

	Don’t want to use troops before Monday in those circs.



Ll.G.	Wd. be mistake to bring troops up now.



H.A.	No need qua food before at least middle of next week.



W.M.	A little short time is being worked, &amp; there may be more.



H.A.	Long-term consequences will be felt in Jan/Mar., when we shall be short of meat anyhow.  Reason : lack of voyages of ships.



A.E.	Say this clearly, as soon as strike is over.  } Agreed.

						        } M/L. to concert.	}

P.T.	Together with industrial damage.	        }			           	}

					         Some cd. issue over week-end	}

A.E.	Also P.Q. Monday.			



							[Exit J.B.C.

		7.	British Guiana.



A.L.B.	Shall publish Tues. report of constitutional enquiry.  It fully endorses action taken by Govt.  Says direct rule must continue for time being.  Shall say we accept report.





		8.	Canada : Hurricane.



Sw.	Criticism in Toronto Press of lack of message fr. Queen.  Was for Can. Govt. to advise.

	Aid.  Damage is small &amp; v. localised – M/F. said $20 m. wd. cover all compn. personal &amp; material.  Will it fall on local or central Govt. – unknown.

	We mght. involve ourselves in complexity betwn. State &amp; Fed. Govts.  Dutch Govt. are, however, now offering $50.000.

	On financial grounds, no case.  But think we shd. offer if Fed. Govt. wd. welcome it. Suggest £20,000, as token of our sympathy.



W.	Prefer £25.000 – to get clearly above Dutch.



RAB.	1919-50 we only twice gave these sums.  Since then, a landslide.

	This is pure sentiment.



Sw.	Canada gave $1 m for all floods of ’53.  U.K., Holland and Belgium.



D.S.	Wdn’t aid in kind look better.



A.E.	It is Dutch offer that changes our posn.



Sw.	We cd. offer in cash or kind.



		Agreed : Offer, if agreeable to Fed. Govt.



	



		9.	Persia.



A.E.	Senate have appd. agreement.  Shah will sign tomorrow.
