C. 33(54)								12th May, 1954



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter S.Ll., B.H.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Select Cttee. wish to send Sub-Cttee. abroad.  Pressure to agree.  But L.O.’s concerns tht. this wd. imply claim by H/C. to jurisdn. abroad.  Am therefore telling them finally they can’t do it.





		2.	Indo-China.



P.M.	A.E. is not returning this w/end.

	Posn. at Geneva is v. confused.



S.Ll.	V. Minh proposals are clever – esp. recognn. of Fr. cultural interests and free elections.  Good propaganda in I-China.



Sw.	Messenge fr. A.E. to PM’s of Asian Doms.  V. helpful.



P.M.	No general will want to fight to preserve Fr. Empire in I.China.

	U.S. have always shown special interest in China : but doubt if they will go into this alone.  No sign tht. anyone will join them.





		3.	Members’ Expenses.



R.A.B.	Propose to speak about middle of debate.



P.M.	Better : no final speech for Govt. at end.



RAB.	  	(i)	Shepherd has seen J.B-C. &amp; said he &amp; his friends wd. favour 			straight salary increase.  They have bn. in touch with Dalton 			&amp; Morrison.

			Are likely to join in all-Party motion next week.

			But majority of our supporters wd. oppose that.  I must remain 			non-committal.  But seems tht. next week there mght. be 				absolute majority for salary increase.  Wd. be Supply Day.

	  	(ii)	Members. Fund – hardship.  Shall I mention possibility of Ty. 			contn. to this – for pensions.  Wd. be only a few thousands in 			next year or so.  Wd. not commit myself.



P.T.	Favour a mention.



J.S.	Fear where it may lead.  Actuarial possibilities.



R.A.B.	Prs. I had better not throw out this suggestion.

	(iii)	Salaries of Junion Ministers.  Shd. I say anything on that?



J.S.	Keep all Ministers together &amp; separate from Members.



P.M.	There will be no diffy. on Junior Ministers : but better discuss this with Opposn. later when M.P.’s expenses is out of the way.

	Avoid this ques at the present.



R.A.B.	  	(iv)	Subsistence plan : based on nights when Parlt. meets.  But there 			is case 	for extending it to week-ends during session.  That wd. 			give another £50 p.a.  A business-man cd. claim that.



H.M.	Restrict it to nights when House is meeting.



R.A.B.	  	(v)	On this occasion, I propose to make no reference to expenses of 			Peers – tho’ I don’t retract my offer as made to Cabinet.



J.S.	  	(vi)	You will be asked if allowance affects claim on income tax for 			extra expenses due to living away.



R.A.B.	You won’t be able to get it both ways.  Alternatives.





		4.	Teachers Superannuation Bill.



H.C.	Not proposed to take it next week.



B.H.	Have seen 22 of the 26 unreliable Tories.  Reported results.



F.H.	Continuing delay is most embarrassing – unless indicn. can also be

                x/	given that Govt. will go on with the Bill.



RAB.	Dissidents’ arguments are unsound.  P.A.C. criticism will be repeated if f’coming report, wh. will urge tht. situation shd. be remedied.

	If this isn’t done, there will have to be Supp. Estimate.  Shd. be done in July, but can p’pone until Feby. 

	If this is delayed 2 years, it will be a bill of £3 or £4 M. for taxpayer.

	Teachers are not being ill-treated.  Don’t want to review all other contributory schemes – that wd. be worse.  No scheme cd. be devised more favourable than this to teachers.  If delayed, they wd. get a worse settlement.  They do better now than people under comparable schemes.

	My view is therefore tht. we must go on with this.  Cd. accept more delay.  But shd. be done this summer or autumn.



B.H.	Our numbers in H/C. 20 M.P.’s ill : of whom 12 are long-term.  1 Minister abroad, instead of 3.  Y’day’s majority of 17 was prob,. larger than we deserve.  Can’t therefore say this wd. be carried.  



H.C.	If we don’t take 2nd. Rdg. soon we can’t pass Bill thro’ H/C. (?) before recess.



P.M.	Special (foreign) circs. for delay haven’t changed much. 	  [Exit P.T.

	Govt. defeat wd. do injury to our national prestige – and hamper A.E. at Geneva.

	Consider it again next week.



F.H.	Can we say x/?  I have bn. stalling for 2 months.



J.S.	I have said we haven’t given up the Bill.  Wd. wish to reiterate that blaming delay on lack of Parly. time, due to Opposn. tactics.



H.M.	Shd. we not decide our intentions first – then presentation.

	If we are defeated, we shall lose ability to carry other Bills e.g. on Report.

	Habit of being beaten might gain ground – failure of discipline in Party.  Might lose ability to carry out main business.

	Presentn.  Used to be common for Bills to die.  Massacre of innocents.

	Cd. we not at some stage say we are not going to proceed with it “this Session” – tho’ affirming our confidence in the principles of the Bill.



W.M.	Support that view.



Sw.	If we are defeated on this economy measure, shall we be able to carry the others?



J.S.	Running away from this won’t help with that.



O.L.	Don’t run away : m’tain it shd. be done – tho’ not possible this Session.



M.F.	Cd. we get 2nd. Rdg. in July.

	If you don’t do this, we shall not get support for £250 M. of economies.



B.H.	Dissidents are not worried qua economy but qua discriminn. v. teachers.



T.D.	If you go on, P.M. must make it issue of confidence at outset, on 2nd. Rdg.  Prefer therefore to say “not now.”



P.M.	We have neither right nor obligation to attempt things we cannot carry by votes.  We are the creatures of votes.



R.A.B.	Cd. we draw up statement – covering Parly. time : intellectual

             y|	arguments (for Press) : posn. of Ministers who support principle.

	|	Solution of Funds’ posn. must be put thro’ – but not necessary in any 

	|	particular week or month.



F.H.	Hope that such a statement can be made next week.



H.C.	It should be.



		Agreed :	RAB. to have statement prepared as at y/

				with a view to announcement next week.

							

								[Exit BH.



		5.	Colonial Exports.



O.L.	Warning only.  But suggns. welcomes.



R.A.B.	   	(i)	Can handle this.  On dollars we only set a ceiling.

			W. Indies have behaved well.

	  	(ii)	Internal affairs.  Ty. can discuss with C.O.

	 	(iii)	Decided in 1952 not to pursue this.  Will consider with C.O.

			&amp; B/T. wtr we take it up on review of G.A.T.T.



Ll.G.	We have helped Jamaica on sugar – taking 3 times as much and 10 times the value.



P.M.	Jamaican cigars shd. have a run here.

	Bananas too – while starving Jamaicans hurry here to enjoy our social services.



R.A.B.	Can say we are anxious in review of G.A.T.T. to help Colonies.





		6.	Egypt : Defence Negotiations.



S.Ll.	Shinwell is askg. today wtr negotns. are procdg. &amp; wtr troops w’drawn.

	Shall say – not procdg : troops are not being w’drawn.

	Reason (if pressed) pol. changes in Egypt.





		7.	Russian Ballet : Visit to U.K.



S.Ll.	Fr. Govt. have cancelled visit of R. Ballet to Paris because of D. B. Phu.

	Suggd. it shd. come here instead.  Shd. we discourage that.



M.F.	I cdn’t properly refuse permn. to land.  Wd. be inconsistent with my general policy.



S.Ll.	F.O. cd. prs. kill it by informal advice.



P.M.	Offer no formal opposn. : invite them to consider French feelings.  Let it take its normal course.





		8.	Sudan.



P.M.	Mahdi’s son to be arrested and tried.



S.H.	After riot of 1/3 Cttee. of investign. was appointed : and a Br. barrister has said there is prima facie case v. him.  Council of Ministers know of this.  We can ensure a fair trial before impartial court.

	Wd. damage our case in Sudan if we tried to put him above the law.



P.M.	Agree – we shd. not interfere with the course of justice.
