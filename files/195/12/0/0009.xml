C. 21(54)							22nd March, 1954



		1.	Television.



A.E.	Shd. I give a Party political television fr. official residence in Carlton Terrace.



RAB.	I am doing it on Budget from 11 Downing St.

	And Gaitskell wants to answer fr. room of official Leader of Oppn. in H/C.



H.C.	V. doubtful wtr anythg. like this shd. be done – esp. a Party b’cast.

	Surprised tht. permission shd. be given.



		Agreed :	A.E. shd. go ahead with this proposal.

				Doubts expd. re Gaitskell.



		2.	Kenya.



P.M.	Welcome O.L. on return.  Congratns. on success of mission.





		3.	Egypt.



A.E.	U.S. have returned promising reply to my enquiry.

	Negotns. in Cairo must be suspended because of disorders in Canal Zone.

	M’while, I will see what I can work out with U.S., w’out commitment, which mght be advanced as Anglo-American proposals.



P.M.	On reflection, fear tht. U.S. by minimum contn. may be able to exert maximum influence on our policy – here and in Sudan.

	E. have now w’drawn what we thght they wd. offer on Turkey.



A.E.	Anglo-U.S. discn. on this needn’t tie our hands in Sudan.

	My enquiry went up to President.  State Dept. thght it a manoeuvre to involve them in Base.  But in spite of that E. and D. wanted to help us.

	Labour Left may argue tht. what I said in H/C. to-day meant surrender to our Right.



J.S.	Mtg. with them on Thurs.?  L.P.S. and A.H.



H.C.	A.H. gave a lecture on Base and what wd. be involved if force reduced to 10,000.  No political argument or discussion.  They learned a lot – about the difficulties.



A.L.B.	Cd. second proposal in my memo. be approved.



A.E.	Demurred.



P.M.	We have got into another phase of suspension.

	Had hoped for a definite break, followed by re-deploymt.

	We shd. keep 15,000 betwn. Ismailia and Port Said – so long as we have no confidence in E. Govt.  As in C.O.S. report.



A.E.	I still aim at an agreement.  For any alternative is worse.  If we remain w’out their assent we shall have to fight them – and that will need many more than 15,000 men.

	Tho’ some redeploymt. at right moment might put them in a better mood.



R.A.B.	How much more time have we?

	We can’t afford both Germany and Egypt – in terms of overseas cost.



A.E.          x/	Cd. we at least begin the contraction of the Base?



Sal.	In final solution, we assume no more troops in Zone than pre-war?



P.M.	I would give no indication of this m’while.



		Agreed :	A.E. To explore Anglo-U.S. approach.

				W.O. to consider and report on x/.





		4.	Royal Tour.					[Exit A.L.B.



Sw.	Menzies has conferred with State Govt. and has now announced substantial modification of tour proposed in W.Australia.

	He has over-ridden views of State Premier.

	Queen will stay in Gothic throughout.  All indoor ceremonies will be cancelled.  All her food will come fr. Gothic.  No shore leave for crew.

	Outbreak described by his medical adviser as epidemic on increasing scale.

	Queen has signified her approval.

							[Exit C.O.S., 3 Serv. Min.

							   N. Birch.

		5.	Atomic Energy : Hydrogen Bomb.       



P.M.	A no. of P.Q.’s on these ques.

	D. Worker to-day, Dean of Canterbury discloses the water-burst story.



	I feel tht. in present circs. a weightier answer or statement is called for.

	I have written to Eisenhower posing the issues.

	Consultn. is a matter of gt. importance.

	Unless I make a significant statement, there may be an explosion of public feeling.



A.E.	P.Q.’s arise fr. Dulles’ statements – Pearsons’ comment etc.  Dulles has given re-assurance tht. they won’t act w’out consultn.



P.M.	I feel that some note of gravity of this situation.

	Read a draft of statement preliminary to answers to specific Ques on consultation.



A.E.	P.Q.’s don’t ask for this.  But no harm in giving background.

	Assurances re consultn. are oral, betwn P.M. and Eisenhower.



P.M.	There is a P.Q. to A.E. on hydrogen bomb.



H.C.	Such a statement wd. provoke demand for debate.  We have no time to give for it.



Sw.	In view of Nixon’s statement re nibbles, we shall be asked awkward ques re use of atomic weapons in renewed hostilities in Korea etc.,



A.E.	We had oral assurances in B’muda.  We cdn’t say that : but we cd. say we were satisfied with the [assurances given] [position]



H.M.	Public concern is, not re weight of bomb, but risk tht. U.S. will use it on a minor occasion &amp; thus bring R. retaliation on us.



A.E.	I agree.  And on this we can give assurance tht. we shall be consulted.

	But I feel that U.S. will soon assume that any action by them is atomic.  They will have all their armaments attuned and fitted for atomic weapons only.



D.S.	U.S. Strategic Air Force is turning over to h. bomb as standard weapon.

	Difference betwn. their posn. and ours is tht. U.S. can’t be attacked with this by R. for next 5 years or so.



Sal.	Favour more genl. knowledge of all this – to deter war.

	But statement now will provoke many ques about concerted policy with U.S., which we can’t answer satisfactorily now.



A.E.	D/Cant. ended by plea for disarmament on a. weapons.  We don’t want to mobilise public support for that viz., our only advantage over R.

	Cd. you say this sort of thing in a speech v. soon.



D.S.      x/	You cd. repeat written assurances re bases in U.K. – not being used for atomic attack w’out our agreement.



P.M.	Yes.  Agreed.



M.F.	We must some time explain this – &amp; it’s effect as a deterrent of world war.  But we aren’t quite ready to do it yet.



	Dulles’ assurances in Press Conference are reasonable – implies they wd. use it w’out consultn. only for self-preservation.
