C. 55(54)							28th July, 1954





		1.	Russia : Good Will Delegation.		[Enter B.H.



Sim.	Speaker and I have recd. y’day invitn. to send Parly. delegation to Moscow.



H.C.	I had tentative enquiry fr. Ambassador 2 wks. ago.



Sim.	Will consult F.O. on terms of reply to be sent.



A.E.	They asked for agricultural delegn. to go : I assented, but dissented from suggn. tht. a Minister shd. accompany it.





		2.	Egypt : Defence Negotiations.



P.M.	Leader in D. Herald.  Labour Party intend to oppose the agreement.  They gave notice last night.



A.E.	They were waspish : they didn’t say they wd. vote v. it.  My view is tht. they will abstain.



B.H.	All steps taken to mobilise big Tory vote – to-morrow.



H.C.	Labour offered to drop steel debate to-day to give us time to debate Egypt.  Offer seemed suspect.  We have therefore decided to table a Motion approving heads of agreement – for debate Thurs. in advance of Consol. Fund Bill ending at 7.30 p.m. or 8.0. p.m.  They may devise amendmt. which wd. cause some of ours to abstain – &amp; we mght. then be in minority.

	Can justify our refusal of their offer : House wd. be assembling to-day for announced business &amp; wd. have cause to complain if they were plunged at once into debate on Egypt.



P.M.	If Govt. were defeated, House wd. have to adjourn after division on 29/7.



H.C.	Cd. try to get it thro’ – after promising debate on Friday on vote of confidence.  Mght even get Consol. Fund Bill on the nod.



R.A.B.	Wd. probly. go thro’ on the nod if put from the Chair.





		3.	Germany : Bonn Conventions.



H.C.	CRA has asked if Parlt. wd. be recalled if Bonn Convns. are brght into force during recess.  Propose to say Parlt. will have chance to debate before the separating agreemt. is ratified &amp; comes into force.



A.E.	Hope time-table will work out in such a way tht. won’t be necessary to recall Parlt. for that purpose.



P.M.	Don’t like this growing practice of committing ourselves in advance to recall in certain circs.  Shd. be left to discretion of Govt. &amp; Speaker.



J.S.	Even if this is a safe bet, on time-table, it’s bad precedent for future.



A.E.	This formula doesn’t pledge us to recall.  We cd. make the Germans wait until October.





		4.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for first week after re-assembly.  Subject, of course, to change.

							[Enter I.McL., A.L.B., 						Att.G., D.E.



		5.	Legislative Programme for 1954/55.



H.C.	Party expects legn. to be as light as possible &amp; Session to end in July.

	Means only 26-45 days for legn.  V. short.

	Broad issue – do we go on with D.R. project : can we do it all next Session or shd. we omit the Land Bills.  Or, do we leave this &amp; select Bills from Class D.

	First course means 7 Bills, all of which wd. be opposed by Labour.



Sim.	County Court Jurisdiction.  This is urgently needed.  Recommended by Evershed Cttee. in ’49 : drafted by Labour Govt: wd. be non controversial.  	Wd. be useful &amp; popular.



A.E.	Must not overload p’mme. – esp. since new Bills will arise.



M.F.	Wd. be gt. thing if we cd. redeem our pledge, &amp; dismantle whole structure.  Must get rid of D.R. 55 before Election.

	Cd. we not go on with Bills, reducg. them to minimum?

	If we do only half, we shall have to leave some Regs. &amp; all ancillaries.

	Much less attractive result to present.

	Effect of Crichel Down – turn p. opinion in favour of freedom.



J.S.	Support full effort.  



W. 	So do I.



R.A.B.	V. heavy task.  Land legn. will be controversial.  Tempy. Bill offers many opportunities for debate. – review of whole economy.  Won’t be much time for anything else.

	If we do only part, shd. we go for Economic group or Land?



M.F.	If forced to choose, I wd. end D.R.  But then we shd. have Land Regns. prominently in force – with v. awkward pol. results because of Crichel Down controversy.  Land Bills have bn. heavily pruned by H.A. Cttee.: remaining powers are not v. controversial.



H.M.	Tories will like D.R. 55 Bill better than Land Bill.



Sal.	You cd. cover much of the land needs in temporary Bill.  That wd. have advantage of extinguishing the general powers.



A.E.	Can you estimate Parly. time required?



H.C.	V. long – &amp; wd. necessitate time tables.

	I wd. favour doing 55 &amp; leaving Land Bills over.



R.A.B.	If we did none of this, we cd. do Road Traffic Bill.



ALB.	Which wd. be popular, tho’ long &amp; controversial.



M.F.	Freedom.



RAB.	Support philosophy : concerned about time.



A.E.	We have done a lot : cd. say we wd. complete it after Election.



H.M.	Must have Requisitioned Houses Bill anyhow.



J.S.	Go on with prepn. of D.R. 55 Bill &amp; Requ. Houses – and see wtr we can get it through.



W.M.	Nat. Service Acts (Amendmt.) – for skulkers abroad.

	Will be opposed only by pacifists.



H.C.	Put it in Class D.  Was overlooked.



W.M.	Class E.  Three Bills on Gowers Reports.  They are unlikely to go fwd.

	Memo. on Occupl. Health Service.  If we don’t do anything, we shall be criticised in T.U.C. circles.  I shall have to do somethg tentative w’in my own field.



I.McL.	We can ride diffies. with T.U.C. – partly by M/L. adminve. action &amp; partly by saying Gillebaud Rpt. will be relevant &amp; we must await it.



P.M.	Unlikely to be good feeling in H/C. in last session before Election.

	We shd. avoid detailed legn. wh. can’t be popularly presented.



H.C.	Will Cabt. endorse para. 14(iv).



A.E.	Transport.  Is that suitable for a final session?



ALB.	Promised in last Queen’s Speech. Will be pressure for it.



A.E.	Will there be time.  



ALB. 	Wd. be useful to introduce &amp; leave it in order to elicit comments fr. interested parties.



							[Exit ALB., Att.G., B.H.



		6.	Persia.



A.E.		i) go for £30 M., but accept £25 M.

	ii) assent to A.I.O.C.’s tax dodge.  R.A.B. agrees, subject to consent of other Cos. &amp; Persians.

	A.I.O.C. aim to do 2, 3 and 4 in memo. by end of this week.

	They will do v. well out of it, if they can get it.



		Approved.





		7.	Legislation in H/Lords.



Sal.	When we are in power, Dpts. tend to avoid amendmts in H/L.

	Peers won’t study the Bills.

	More Bills shd. be started in H/L.  If all is started in H/C., H/L must sit in July after H/C. has arisen.  Shd. there not be greater bias in favour of starting more in H/L.  E.g. Landlord &amp; Tenant Bill.  Under last Govt. Cos. Act was started in H/L.

	Hope we shall bear this in mind – even at risk of irritating Labour Party in H/C.



H.C.	Endorse this view.  But	 i) in recent years H/C. have started filibustering on H/L. Amendmts.  

ii) Bills passed by H/L. in Feby. can’t be 

		carried fwd. in H/C. until after Finance Bill.



		8.	Civil Expenditure.



R.A.B.		Rural Water &amp; Housing.  Can this be authorised?  Agreed.

		Bread &amp; levy on flour.  Cd. I draft Bill on levy?  Don’t ask for 			immediate decision.



W.M.	But levy wd. work only if price of bread were increased? 



R.A.B.  	Yes.



Ll.G.	V. complicated.  ⅔rd. subsidy goes into bread.  1d. increase saves £10M.

	With levy on flour, you wd. have to restore equivalent to ⅔rds on bread.  	Subsidy wd. be same.  Wd. provoke fiddling as between uses of flour.  V. controversial legn. in our last session – tax on food.  V. costly to administer: hundreds of staff.  Pre-war posn. is not a precedent because then there was no subsidy.



Sw.	Cdn’t pass this legn. in p’mme we have bn. considering.

	Prefer to leave both until after Election.  Shd. lose £18 M. economies.

	But we mght do somethg. else.    Increase sugar by 1d. : wd. give us £10 M. vice £3 M.  Politically easier than bread.



Ll.G.	Open to objn. tht. we shd. be makg. a profit vice lowering a subsidy.



H.M.	Levy – as tax – is worse than bread – redn. of subsidy.



R.A.B.	{Don’t take decision never to reduce bread subsidy.

	{   ..        ..        ..        to introduce flour levy.

Agreed.	{Consider method of increasing revenue on sugar – prs. by excise {rather than profit on trading.



	Education.



F.H.	Deprecate general appeal.  Wd. sooner identify specific things &amp; press them on l.e.a.’s starting in Autumn.	Agreed.



	Estimates.



	Para 2 of Ty. memo.   approved.



	School Meals.



	As before.  Deprecated.



Sw.	May fall – as result of adjustments in family allowances.



R.A.B.	Can be left open.



	Colonial Office Bldg.



Sw.	Cttee. debated various others but concluded it wd. be a waste of money not to go fwd. with this.



R.A.B.	Can arrange with M/W. what figure goes into 1955 Estimate.



D.E.	Want to build at efficient rate once it starts.



RAB.	Ready to agree a reasonable figure.



D.E.	If I started now, it wd. mean £¾M. in ’55.  Must work at an efficient pace.



R.A.B.	Will report an agreed figure to Cabinet to-morrow.



Sal.	Agree v. wasteful to build by fits &amp; starts.
