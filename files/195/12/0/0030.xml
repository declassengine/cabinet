C. 41(54)							18th June, 1954



		1.	Guatemala.					[Enter B-H., S.Ll.



S.Ll.	Right of search – refused 7/10 days ago, in reply to Dulles.



P.M.	Sad that on every ques fr. China to Peru we shd. always have to come down on Communist side.

	I feel no sympathy with Guatemala.

	Cdn’t we send a R.N. squadron to search Br. ships?



S.Ll.	We have told U.S. we will take action on any suspicion notified to us of action by B. subjects or ships.



P.M.	Can’t we do it ourselves – to show firm opposn. to Guatemala.

		M/State to consult with Admy. on possibility.



							            [Exit S.Ll.

		2.	Parliament : Members’ Expenses.



P.M.	We must govern.  Can’t run round endlessly with ears to ground.

	RAB. still prefers flat £250 or £300 allowance.  That has advantage of clarity.  Alternative will give us all the trouble w’out the advantage.



Sal.	We don’t favour alternative because of tactics, but because we think it right.



R.A.B.	C. 201 sets out plan which carries out Cab. view.

	The block allowance is, however, much better in my view.

	Read alternative draft.

	Only 14 return expenses, for tax, below £250.

	Believe this is simpler &amp; more likely to be accepted.

	Parlt. won’t like this “dreadful 12/6”.



H.M.	M.P.’s get expenses w’out detail or ques.  Businessmen don’t.



O.L.	Certificate like that wdn’t be accepted from a business-man.



H.M.	I.R. treat M.P.’s v. leniently.



P.M.	Don’t press for salary increase.  Don’t want complication of subsistence claim.  I favour flat allowance of £300.



H.C.	You invite us to reverse our decn. in favour of subsistence plan.

	A flat allowance for the year differs from [actual] subsistence for actual attendance at W’minster in Session.  Plenty of precedents for it.



H.M.	Not a ques of simplicity – subsistence may be simpler, for people to understand. Nor unusual.   We have just worked out uniform scheme for L. Govt : – for being away from home on duty.

	This is related to a duty – night or day.  The other is “expense account”, wh. is under criticism already.



Sal.	There is also the argument tht. subsistence plan cd. be extended to Peers.  Expense account for Peers wd. never be accepted.



B.H.	Subsistence is different in principle – &amp; wd. be more popular with our Party.  I admit tht. RAB.’s plan wd. be more popular with Opposition.  Hope you will see 1922 Executive before Opposn.



M.F.	Let us make up our minds first.  I favour subsistence plan.



R.A.B.	Believe Opposn. will reject subsistence, but not the other.

	Our supporters shd. now be given a line.



O.L.	RAB.’s plan : public will think it’s only 50% of £500 : not true.

	Eliminates 12/6, wh. will be derided.

	If you cd. make it £1., I wd. think subsistence plan the better.



R.A.B.	L. Govt. rate is £1 only for more than 12 hrs.



H.M.	Most M.P.’s do attend for 12 hrs &amp; more, takg. a/c of St. Cttee.



W.	Believe Cab. cd. agree on subsistence plan if £1 were substituted for 12/6.

	Country wdn’t object to that.

	Country will regard flat £250 as camouflage for salary rise.



M.F.	Subsistence is right because it is directly related to duty done – not substitute for salary increase.

	Flat allowance wd. go well with Opposn., but not with Tory Party in country.  Why alienate them 15 months before an Election.



F.H.	Party are becoming suspicious of M.P.’s “expenses.”



M.F.	The free vote has seriously damaged repn. &amp; dignity of M.P.’s – their apparent greed in voting themselves 50% increase.



O.L.	£250 allowance will be compared with £500 salary net of tax.



P.M.	Wd. like to put both schemes to Executive of 1922.

	If so, another Cabinet wd. be needed before consultn. with Opposn. leaders.

	Put it to them on basis – this is best we can do to help you:  unless you will accept it and help to put it thro’, we can do nothing.

	We wd. do nothing, if it was clear they wd. put whole blame on us.

	But then you wd. have an embittered H/C.



H.C.	Will you argue in favour of subsistence plan, to 1922?  There is a v. strong bias in Cabinet in favour of it.



Sal.	Are you not bound to tell 1922 what Cab. think.  Gt. majority of Cabinet favour subsistence.



P.M.	Shall I put both plans to 1922 reserving right of Cabinet decision?



Sw.	Suppose they ask which we prefer?
