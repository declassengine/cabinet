C. 22(54)							24th March, 1954



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter B-H.



H.C.	Business for next week.



	Television Bill : propose to inform Opposn. tht. we shall take this on floor.

	(No prospect of getting it thro’ in Cttee.)  Shd. try for agreed time-table.

	Can’t spare more than 6 days.



P.M.	Do our supporters like it?  



W. 	No.  



P.M. 	So much done to meet criticism that it now pleases no one.  A flop.

	But see if you can get agreed time-table.  If that is impossible we can consider wtr we impose a time-table or drop the Bill.  If time-table is intended, impose it at outset of Cttee. stage.





		2.	Jordan : Frontier Dispute.



A.E.	Concerned at situation developing since last incident.

	Israeli’s have now withdrawn repves. fr. Armistice Commn.

	Can’t leave this alone.  How shd. we intervene?  We are in special posn. as ally of Jordan.  M/State is telling Amb. of Jordan we take serious view &amp; askg. wtr he and Israeli Amb. wd. come &amp; discuss with us limited ques of frontier squabbe.  If J. will join, we will extend formal invitn. to I., who have already bn sounded informally.

	It wd. be private.



P.M.	Welcome this initiative.    Use my name with Israelis.

							                  [Exit B-H.

				

		3.	East/West Trade.



P.M.	Message from Eisenhower.  Will be circulated.  Was read to Cabinet.

	Propose immediate reply by telegram, followed by longer letter.

	Both were read to Cabinet.



A.E.	U.S. Amb. thinks tht. on receipt of these messages Eis. will probably arrange for Stassen to come over to Ldn. for discussions.



P.T.	Minor amendment to make it clear tht. R. has access, w’out imports, to materials needed for nuclear developmt.



A.E.	We shd. make it more clear, in public, tht none of this applies to China.







		4.	Newsprint.



P.M.	Decontrol wd. lead to disappearance of trash – and increased prosperity of pp supportg Tory Party thro’ increased advertising. Benefits of freedom are undoubted.



R.A.B.	Discussed by E.P.C., at initiative of W.  Read lr. about to go to W. offering some concession on condns. stipulated.

	Dollar risk of complete freedom is too great.



P.T.	Wd. like further chance of discussing this.  For it involves me in makg. corresponding cut on Scandinavian supplies.



R.A.B.	There will be such an opportunity at E.P.C. tomorrow.



W.	Present system is not defensible. viz., control over no. of pages not circulation.

	Newspp. are all against us.  We are v. vulnerable politically. They must be given a decision by Friday p.m. on their immediate request.



P.M.	Hope we may de-ration.



W.	RAB’s proposal won’t do that – enough merely to m’tain existg. decision.





		5.	Equal Pay.					[Enter I. McL.



R.A.B.	Have shown memo. to interested Ministers.

	Cd. do with an attractive morsel in my Budget.

	Wd. like to put it to our credit tht. we have made first move to introduce this into C. Service.  Scheme wd. be completed in 5-7 years.

	Don’t propose to extend it to industrials.

	Don’t propose to say myself it shd. extend to teachers – wd. leave that to Burnham machinery.



	Cost wd. not exceed £3 M. in first year.

	Arguments against.  Further rises &amp; uncertainties in industry.

	But pol. pressure is becoming irresistible.  Wd. be v. diff. to hold further debates in H/C.  Labour Party have commd. themselves to do it when in office.



F.H.	Teachers wd. certainly have to have it.  Wd. cost £17 M.

	They might delay its operation for one year; and then adopt a gradual scheme.  We cd. prevent a more expensive scheme than ours.



W.M.	To this proposal I wdn’t object.  It is bound to come.

	But stress distn. betwn. industrials &amp; non-industrials.  C.S. pay is determined by Tomlin formula.  But industrials’ rates are fixed on fair-wages principle : &amp; employers wd. resent our giving the lead in industrial field.  Where 7 m. women wd. be affected.  Condns. outside have h’to bn. reflected back into Govt. industrials.  If we reverse this, it wd. be v. dangerous.



M.F.	Can’t hold pol. posn.  Shall be mocked if we delay giving effect to our pledge.



O.L.	Industrial condns. are different.  Can never get it in industry.

	In some occupns. equal pay wd. drive women out of emplt.

	Hope therefore tht. we can escape industrial repercussions.



H.M.	i)  Can you hold it to a 7 year p’mme.  I doubt it.  Better chance prs. of holding 3 year p’mme if you said so at once.

	ii) £8-9 M. cost on l. govt. services – a v. heavy load on rates.

	Increases argument for review of l. govt. finance.



A.E.	Don’t believe in political dividends earned by these things.

	May be we can’t avoid doing it.  But don’t expect votes from it.  More likely to lose some.

	Support H.M.’s point (i).  4 year period might be best.  



W.	Agree with A.E.  With a 7 year plan it may lose us votes.  Wd. prefer 3 year plan.



H.C.	No electoral advantage at all.  Probably, if done by stages, we may get a disadvantage.

	Also think it wrong on merits.



Sal.	May be we can’t avoid it.  But, once principle is admitted, we can’t deny it anywhere.  Will prob. lose some women their jobs.

	This may be good socially.

	Accept that it can’t prs. be delayed.



P.T.	I am against it.

	RAB will come down from 7 years to 3.  Cost is £37M.  Industry is suffering from too much exp’re.  We ought to be striving to reduce burden of taxation on industry.

	We have held it for years, during wh. a majority in H/C. wd. have favoured it.



P.M.	No-one can doubt it is economically indefensible.

	Nor is it to advantage of women – many of whom will lose jobs.

	Lrs. in N. Chronicle some weeks back.

	But, if it’s going to happen anyhow, we might get credit.



R.B.	We cd. give industry a lot of relief for £36 M.

	And cost wd. be much greater if extended to industry.



I.McL.	Must spread to Health Service in time.  Cd. hold it for some time but not prs. for more than 3 years.

	Politically, think we must do this.



A.E.	i)  Helpful to Budget.  That is weighty.

	ii) Re-assured by W.M.’s promise re industry.



P.T.	Pledge shd. be all right.  For R.A.B. has said we must cut expenditure in ’55 &amp; we can only do so by changes in policy which we shd. have to justify by argument that our economic condn. demands economy.



R.A.B.  	Will review this in light of discussion.





		6.	Agricultural Subsidies.



R.A.B.	Total subsidies now up to £300 M.  And £200 M. for agriculture.

	Want to find methods of curbing this w’out raising Corn Acts cry.  Only means are cutting subsidy or a levy.  I want to refer, w’out commitment, to possibility of levy subsidy on flour.  Don’t ask for decision to-day.



P.M.	M/F. comment raises echoes from past.  1d. on the loaf can be understood by all.  But makg. bread dearer doesn’t mean less is eaten – therefore poorest suffer most.  “V. diff. to meet that argument : I never tried to”.



O.L.	But average industrial wage is now £7.



W.M.	Wd. be v. embarrassing in wage negotns. if 1d. went on bread.



Ll.G.	Diffy. of returning to 1932 machinery is tht. we have subsidy on bread.  Our policy has bn. to reduce subsidies.  Right thing surely is to reduce subsidy.  Can’t have levy while bread subsidy continues.

	My plan is tht any redn. in wheat prices shd. go to reduce subsidy not retail price.



T.D.	Support that method.



Sw.	V. dangerous to mention levy subsidy in Budget speech.  Shd. get worst of both worlds.



A.E.	Don’t say anything until we know what we are going to do.



H.M.	Agreed.



T.D.	Don’t wish principle of levy to be rejected.  But size of levy shd. depend on world price of wheat.



W.	Suggn. tht. we intend to increase basic food prices wd. be v. bad.



R.A.B.  	Will have a further discn. on this at E.P.C. tomorrow.





		7.	Electoral Reform.				[Exit I.McL.



M.F.	Grimston wants to apply single transferable vote to his own constituency.

	Recommend tht. Govt. spokesman shd. take line indicated in memo.





		8.	Regional Organisation.



		Memo. approved.





		9.	Policy towards Japan.



		Memo. noted.
