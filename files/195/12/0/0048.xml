C. 66(54)							15th October, 1954



		1.	Cyprus.



A.E.	B.B.C. have arranged b’cast interview with Archbishop of Cyprus after 9 p.m. news to-night.  Awkward also that C.O. shd. have asked Govr. to come to U.K. at this time.  Archb. is en route for U.N.

	Pollitt and Mrs. Jager (fr. Br. Guiana) are in Cyprus.  Indications of Commt. activity there.





		2.	Formosa.



A.E.	W. Robertson, who went to see Chiang, is China lobby man.

	Also (para 2 of W’ton. tel. 2200) said tht. Dulles has had this in mind for some time.

	Para 2(c) is v. awkward.  U.K. press Peking &amp; Moscow to co-operate but are expected to conceal intentns. re Treaty.  Surely I can’t do that.

	Treaty is unnecessary – in view of decln. already made by U.S. re neutralisation of Formosa.

	Some danger of appearing to enable Chiang, via Treaty, to remain in the islands nearer the coast – in addn. to Formosa.

	F.O. tel. 5165.

	Am disposed to say that this alters posn. &amp; before going fwd. with the operation wd. wish to know exactly what the Treaty is.

	Much to be said for saying to U.S. – if you are going to make a treaty with Formosa, make it first : and get it out of the way before we do this operation.



		Agreed :	Inform U.S. as at x/.

				Add : imposs. for us to approach Peking &amp;

				Moscow as planned w’out telling them about

				the Treaty : &amp; that wd. prob. not produce

				desired results re Oracle.



							[Enter Watkinson

		3.	Industrial Disputes.



H.W.	Met employers this a.m. – they will talk, but won’t compromise their posn. on freedom to work ports by overtime as needed.

	Met Deakin : little hope of getting his 15,000 unofficials back.

	Seeing Stevedores now.  They are only hope.  Just conceivable they

	mght agree, on ct. of enquiry, to go back but continue their overtime

	ban.

	But not much hope because lightermen have now decided to come out.

	When troops are used efforts will be made by Communists to spread it to other ports &amp; Unions.



M.F.	Troops.  5.000 for food &amp; 2.000 for refuse.

	W.O. can produce 4.000 on Thursd. and then 1200 a day.

	No decision until mid-day Mon. – to give chance of conciliation.



A.E.	What of exports.  Cd. troops be used for that?



M.F.	D.R. wd. cover any national interest.  They cd. assist, if decided in policy to do so.



H.M.	Wd. lose more if it had effect of spreading strike to other ports.



P.M.	Need for general statement – dangerous situation : loss of exports : diversion of ships etc.,



H.W.	These things are being said at mtgs at M/L. &amp; can be included in statement to be issued this evening.



J.S.	That to-night.



	Announcement tomorrow of ct. of enquiry.

	If these don’t get the men back, decn. on Monday to introduce troops.

	That wd. be the moment for a Govt. declaration.
