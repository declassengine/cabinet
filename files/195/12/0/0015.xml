C. 27(54)							7th April, 1954 (6 pm.)



								[Enter D.S., de La W.

		1.	Post Office Workers : Wages Claim



P.M.G.	Original claim must be rejected, as inconsistent with arbitn. award.

	But postmen are lagging behind in wages &amp; have a case on economic grounds.  5 pt. rise in c/l. index since last award.  They wd. prob. succeed at arbitn.

	But Union haven’t made claim on economic grounds.  i) wish to super- impose it on value of work award  ii) cd. get more later if c/l. index contd. to rise.



	But these factors wd. win them sympathy in a strike.

	H.A. Cttee. decision of Friday.  If I wrote as suggested (para.3(b)) there wd. be no scope for further discn. : trouble wd. start, beginning in Ldn.  Once in a conflict, if we admd. some economic claim, we shd. appear to surrender.



	Propose therefore tht. I shd. see Geddes before formal lr. or public announcement.



	Wd. say	i)  can’t accept his interpn. of award.

			ii) ready, with him or w’out, to seek elucidn. fr. tribunal.

			iii) ready to consider any “economic” claim.



	Even so, I am advised tht. trouble is likely.  But we shd. be on sounder ground in fighting it.



W.M.	Endorse P.M.G.’s concln.

	First, we must ensure tht. Geddes can’t over turn award on value/work.

	Then, he may come fwd. with economic claim.

	For (iii) substitute “any other claim” – don’t mention “economic”.



PMG.	Probable cost of settlement might be £4M.



M.F.	Use of troops.  1.500 contemplated.  Limited h’to to m’taining essentials to public.  Not used h’to in cases where State is employer.  Wd. prefer therefore tht. it be reserved as v. last resort – exhausting first possibility of making do with volunteers.



P.M.G.	Recognise objns.  But will be diff. to get volunteers.  Our Xmas volunteers are largely P.O. relatives.  Need core of skilled or disciplined men – about 1,500.

	But will review this, &amp; see what I can do.

	Paras. 7-8 paint worst poss. picture.



W.M.	Lr. shd. be answered after first discn. with Geddes.	[Exit P.M.G.

							            [Enter AL.B.



		2.	Industrial Disputes : Railways.



W.M.	Saw ALB &amp; Robertson on stage reached in “structure” negotns.

	7/= increase brght lowest to 124/6.  Tribunal thght differentials shd. be reviewed.

	N.U.R. want increase in basic by 10/6.  A.S.L.E.F. (footplate) threatened strike on 24/4 unless differentials are improved.  Likely to be pacified.

	Cler. &amp; Adminve. want even more.

	Total claimed wd. involve increased costs of £26½ M.

	B.T.C. proposals wd. cost only about £2M.

	N.U.R. are likely to prove intransigent.

	Robertson thinks top-grade engine-men at 180/= won’t get enough.  But further award wd. spread to Tubes &amp; roads.  Also they will be over 10/= better of than in Dec.

	He asked if he was right in holding basic rate to 124/6.  I have said certainly : for otherwise the 7/= underlying all recent awards will be raised – and all other settlemts. on comparable basis will be re-opened.

	We must make a stand against N.U.R. pressure for increase in basic rate.

		Endorsed.



								[Exit ALB.

		3.	European Coal &amp; Steel Community.		[Enter GH.



A.E.	We are being pressed in H/C. re reply to Monnet.

	I favour starting talks, &amp; see wtr steel industry’s diffies. can be overcome as we go along.

	But we shd. then say that it is our object to reach agreement, incldg. common market for steel.

	Alternative : remit whole ques to Cttee. of Ministers.  Don’t object, if it cd. be quick but M/S. will be away 3 wks.



D.S.	My only doubt.  Dangerous to say, in announcemt, tht. we are likely to reach agreemt. – if Monnet’s lr. is publd., impn. will be given tht. we have decided in principle in favour of common market.  Not sure we shall carry steel industry on this : &amp; don’t want a row with them and engineering industry over this.

	From straight industrial angle, they are right – few advantages &amp; gt. risks.  I doubt wtr in fact they will suffer.  They fear tht. High Authy. won’t be able to enforce rules on members.

	I believe we shd. export no more steel to Europe &amp; E. mght export a little more.

	There are important pol. advantages, however – wh. Steel Bd. have recognised.  They will prob. take a broad view therefore.

	First step shd. be to get our steel men in touch with theirs, and seek re-assurances.  Quite a chance tht. misgivings will be reduced.

A.E.	If there is to be a Cttee. it shd. report by end/April.



D.S.	As we have declared our desire to establish close assocn., we can’t refuse to talk.  But in offering to talk we shd. warn Monnet privately tht. we aren’t likely to be able to accept his v. wide proposals.  Avoid public indicn. tht. we favour open market.



R.A.B.	Monnet can’t get here until end/May – now in U.S.

	We shd. invite him to talk – &amp; work out our line m’while.  Cttee. of Ministers can do that over next 5 wks.



A.E.	Cttee.  F.O., Ty., B/T., M/S. and M/F. &amp; P., and C.R.O.



Sw.	If we went in, what about our preferences in Comm. markets?



P.T.	We shd. be pressed to trade them in at 2nd. stage.  This is a point to be discussed by Cttee.



D.S.	We shan’t be able to arrive at public statement re common market – either in Cttee. or in Cabt. – at any early stage.  Shan’t therefore be able to express a view on this in reply to Monnet.



		Agreed : Cttee. as above.



								[Exit D.S., G.Ll.

		4.	High Commission Territories.



Sw.	Malan has tabled resoln. – in terms modified by reason of our repns. 

	Our Press have now got it.

	We can’t delay comment.  When Ques are asked, we shall have to

          x/	say we cdn’t contemplate transfer at this time.

	If therefore there is much Press comment, we shall get a Ques.  Can’t play it long on basis resoln. isn’t yet passed.  We shd. reply as at x/.



P.M.	That line will be supported by all sides in H/C.

	But I wd. wish to see wording of proposed reply.





		5.	Food : Bacon Imports



Ll.G.	Wish to increase Danish imports by 20,000 tons.

	We make profit of £33 a ton.  Ty. get £11M. profit p.a. out of it.

	Diffy. is rate of arrivals.  With extra 20,000 t. I cd. make it a condn. tht. there shd. be regular arrivals.



R.A.B.	My Budget diffies. were due to unforeseen rises in agric. subsidies – little things like these.

	Bacon is only item left which we can control.

	If Cab. wants this, hope M/F. will space it out on imports.

	                                       will consider storing, so as to even deliveries.



		Agreed – as proposed by M/Food.
