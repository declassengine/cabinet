C. 50(54)								13th July, 1954



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter S.Ll., B.H.



H.C.		Business for next week.

		Way is clear (qua Oppsn.) for P.M.G. to go ahead.

		Tuesday : Crichel Down.



W.		R. Cotton Commn. : cd. it start in H/L.



P.T.		Wd. like to consider, in light of precedents.  It is controversial in H/C.



H.C.		Future of M/Materials.



W.	Agreed tht. functions shd. be transferred to B/T. Abolition of M/M. requires aff. resoln. If we can’t get that before recess, Ministry must continue until Nov. – and we lose all credit.



P.M.		Wd. like to make announcemt. next week.

		Must ask H.C. to consider how to find time.





		2.	Meeting with Malenkov.



P.M.		Message from A.E.  Geneva. 898. Read.

		Read further message from Eisenhower.

		Decision must clearly await A.E.’s return.  M. evidently is in no hurry.





		3.	Parliament : Expenses of Members.



RAB.		The £100 tax-free automatic allowance must now be w’drawn.

		Note to this effect shd. be included in W. Paper.

		Retrospection.  Suggest 24/5/54.

									[Enter Att.G.



		4.	Crichel Down.



		a)	Agricultural Land Commission.



T.D.	Developed the case for continuing Agricultural Land Commission.

	Tho’ I propose to require them to dispense with quite a lot of land they now administer.



M.F.		Holding body is needed for purposes in para. 4.

		Important also for advisory functions.



R.A.B.	Need to go further into this.  More drastic approach to review of policy on land generally.  Can’t announce solution in debate, but cd. say it was all under review.  Expensive body.  Prefer Scottish system.  This hasn’t bn. reviewed with enough vigour in light of scandals revealed in Rpt.



H.M.	Endorse that view – from political angle.



Sw.	Found statement on view tht. it’s not business of State to own &amp; manage land.



T.D.	Agree with RAB : but must proceed by stages.



Sal.	Paras 9-10.  Means we shall spend large sums wh. we shan’t retrieve in increased rent.  Shd. we, as trustees, do this?  Better sell it at lower price w’out sinking money in it.



T.D.	Will re-draft this section of my speech, in consultn. with RAB &amp; others.



		(b)	Position of Officials.



J.S.	Opinion will turn v. Ministers unless he stiffens up what he has to say – on this as well as on policy.



P.M.		What is strength of feeling on this point?



B.H.		Considerable.



H.M.	Shd. make it clear that system, laying new burdens on machine, is largely to blame : and that we are going to change the system.



T.D.		Shall have to say somethg. re transfer.



RAB.	Cttee. of 3 will report to-morrow.  Cab. shd. consider wtr their report be published.

	This will provide a bridge to get away from Minister’s original statement (approved by Cabinet) that no further action will be taken.



		(c)	Future Policy on Land Disposal.



M.F.		Revised statement now recommended : as in para. 5.

		No additional enquiry on transfer to another Dpt. – para. 5 of Annex.



R.A.B.		Goes as far as we can.

		Para 5 (a) gives discretion to Minister, which will have to be operated 		thro’ officials.  If we can’t stand to that, we cd. only offer rule of 			automatic operation providing for sale by auction.



Sw.		Need it be restricted to previous owners “who establish special claim”?



M.F.		Those words qualify successor not owner.



J.S.		Add to statement :  This will considerably narrow the area.



M.F.		Or, better, This will prevent another Crichel Down.



P.M.	Stress the argument that we are doing best to prevent recurrence.  That will put in perspective the case for further punishment of officials.



Sim.	Repeat the view tht. State’s duty is to dispose of land no longer required in best interests of State.  “Special claim” is not judiciable – and opens door for all sorts of discretion wh. will invite criticism.



Sal.		“Special personal claim”?



M.F.		I wd. think that best of alternative suggested.



			Agreed. Followed by “his claim”.



W.M.		“personal claim to special treatment”?  



Sal.  		Too special.



Att.G	Para 5 of Annex needs more thght.  Can’t be assumed that 2nd. purpose is always justified.  Don’t accept para 7(b).



M.F.	Not by my words in statement.  Stand by the words &amp; make policy fit.  Re-consider that, if need be.



H.M.	Shd. be a second enquiry.  Purpose &amp; circs. may be quite different.



M.F.	We cd. say we hope to substitute alternative procedure next Session on disappearance of D. Regns.

	Don’t ask for approval of Annex report.  That can be considered.



H.M.	We shall go at least as far as M.F’s statement.  We may go further : &amp; that can be left an open ques.



H.C.	Content so long as door is not closed.



Agreed. M.F., RAB., Sal. &amp; Att.G. to consider final form of statement on the policy ques.



	(d)	Future of Crichel Down.



T.D.	No retrospn. But no legal bar to selling land to Martin subject to the tenancy, including oblign. to equip the land.



W.	Not much of an offer.



J.S.	But offers the hope tht. one day he might get the land back.

	Believe this suggn. shd. be made in debate.



T.D.	It cd. only be sold to one of the previous owners.



	(e)	Continued Employment of Messrs. Sanctuary &amp; Son.



T.D.	Propose to ask Pres. of Chartered Surveyors to nominate someone to report wtr he acted properly.  Report : no impropriety : but 3 grds for comment.  For one Eastwood takes responsibility.  Do the other two warrant dismissal?  Wd. wish to consider, in consultn. with M.F.



M.F.	Effors of judgmt. probably warrant decision not to employ them further as agents.



	(f)	Form of Debate.



	On motion for adjournment.

							[Exit Att.G.  H.M.



	5.	Foreign Affairs.



S.Ll.	i)	A.E. going to Paris to meet Dulles to-day.

	ii)	Egypt.  No indication of E. attitudes to our latest offer.

iii)	Germany.  Bonn conventions ratified by Parlt.  May have to separate the two.  We have told French &amp; they are not disturbed.  Mention to H/C to-morrow.

									[Exit Sim.



	6.	High Commission Territories.



Sw.	Cab. suggn. incorporated in new draft.



P.M.	Para. 13 Suggested amendment.



Sw.	“Whatever view may be taken – and H.M. Govt. do not here express a view ….”

	Malan is on holiday.  Note can be handed to Forsyth, for onward transmission.





	7.	Industrial Disputes.



W.M.	i)	7/8.000 may be involved by unoffl. strike at Margam.  Another

		mtg. this p.m.

	ii)	National Newspapers.  Mght be no newspp. on Monday.
