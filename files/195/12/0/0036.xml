C. 47(54)								7th July, 1954



						[Enter 3 Serv. Min., C.O.S., ALB., BH.

	1.	Parliament.



P.M.	Statement or debate? – on W’ton talks.



A.E.	No material for statement at once, beyond communiqué 

	Next week, Parlt. cd. have one or other.  Rs. debate wd. be easier if they want one.

	But Mol. is returning to Geneva to-day : they may be aiming at agreemt. by week-end.



H.C.	No demand yet.  Debate wd. have to be in Oppn. time.



R.A.B.	Two P.Q.’s y’day.  They will expect a statement by P.M. at some time.



A.E.	That might stop down pressure for debate.



P.M.	Cd. make a statement Thursday.  F.O. to prepare a draft.

	Admission of China to U.N. – is being given disproportionate emphasis in U.S. Press.



A.E.	Canada wants consultn. before we make any pronouncemt. on this.  They wish it kept as open as possible.  

P.M. Referred to Adlai Stevenson’s reference to this – Manch. Guard. 5/7.  

V. sensible approach to problem : the most sensible likely in U.S.



P.M.	Wd. prefer to avoid anything this week – statement or debate next week.  Ascertain Opposition’s wishes?  



Agreed : Ch. Whip to enquire.  

C.R.A. Wd. like statement Thursday – or Monday at latest.  Agreed : Statement on Monday.  F.O. to draft 

   can be sent in advance to Doms.





	2.	Members’ Expenses.



R.A.B.	Have draft [Parly.] statement.  Want to show it to CRA to-day.

	Wd. cab. wish to see it first?

	Copies circulated.

	Can be revised before used in H/C.  But is it good enough to show to Opposn.?



P.M.	V. good.

	General approval indicated.



H.M.	Hope it will be known as “sessional subsistence allowance”.



RAB.	Will consider later wtr this can be suggested in H/C statement.





3.	Egypt.



A.E.	Drew attention to agreed minute.

	This agreemt. with U.S. is as good as we cd. have expected.  Economic aid is best sanction we cd. expect.  U.S. will also make public statement re Canal.



P.M.	Broadens our action : also implies greater assurance tht. agreemt. will be kept.



R.A.B.	Further trade concessions now offered if £10 M balances released.

	x|	I favour linking this with resumed negotns.



A.E.	Shall try to include Persia as well as Turkey.  Also longer period.



A.E.	Minute of agreemt. was U.S. draft.  Unusually helpful.



A.L.B.	This goes further than we dared expect.  Shipping authies. will welcome it.



B.H.	The 41 have bn. meeting., on basis of newsrpts. Fear somethg. may have bn. going on behind their backs (!).



H.C.	M/page article in D.T. by W’house last week.



P.M.	My whole attitude has bn. changed by apprecn. of changed mil. sitn. – esp. extension of NATO on northern line reaching via Turkey to Pak’n.  Also nuclear war, &amp; now H-bomb, seems to exlude southward plunge thro’ Caucasus – &amp; increased vulnerability of Base.

	Misuse of troops &amp; resources in present strategic condns.

	Finally, condns. bad for morale &amp; recruitment to Br. Army.

	I am now ready to defend w’drawal on mil. grounds.

	Willing to support this, tho’ not without distress.



R.A.B.	Full statement of grounds shd. be made to F.A. group of Party tho’ a few cannot be converted, many can.



B.H.	Supported this v. strongly.  Everyone will come to it.  Not ’22.



R.A.B.	Yes – before negotns. are resumed.



P.M.	15/7.



A.E.	Cd. begin negotns. before that?



P.M.	Yes, surely.



P.M.	Let A.H. do it, with Keighley &amp; C.I.G.S



H.C.	Don’t bring Generals into this – it is wholly political ques.



A.H.	Can do it quite well enough.



P.M.	Let AE accompany him.



R.A.B.	Cd. be done next Tuesday.  Don’t delay assumption of negotns.

	Chief Whip to consider arrangemts. &amp; timing.



de L.	Telegrams to &amp; fro’ Cairo.  Want to limit Air Force exp’re in M/E.

	Can do with fewer installations than have bn. mentioned in list.

	Don’t wish to be drawn into m’taining E. air installations.

	Doubt if Abu Sueir will be kept. – tho’ enlarged by us for U.S. use. E. will probly. wish to have it as theirs, &amp; U.S. may then have to negotiate with E. for rights they need.

	Must we m’tain by Br. funds staging post for U.S. aircraft.



Sw.	It was v. useful tht. we gave these facilities to U.S. for transit to I/China.



AE.	Do you want para. 10?  Thought it was valuable.



R.A.B.	Can we do x/?



A.E.	Wdn’t favour associating the two too closely.



R.A.B.	Then let me get rid of it before negotns. start.



A.E.	I wd. favour that.

						[Exit Serv. Min., C.O.S., ALB.

						[Enter Amory, D.S.



	4.	East-West Trade.



R.A.B.	P.T.’s message.  Ques put to him.  His answers.

	While some points wh. H/C. won’t like, this gives better impressn.

	If we are to have agreemt. (£17M. trade for us) – can’t we get a bit more : &amp; can we present it to H/C. as not wholly closed?



H.A.	On further informn. we think we shd. accept agreemt.  Tho’ we are concerned tht. peeling off shd. begin before recess.  Traders with firm orders have bn. delayed 3 mos.  Will I/China posn. change quickly

x|	enough? Shd. P.T. warn Stassen tht. if date for this can&apos;t be settled by agreemt., we may bring them in (agreed changes) after mtg on 19/7.

	On this, tho’ we lose £17M. on rolling mills, others will come along for £17M.  That was last night’s estimate.  Now, on P.T.’s telegram, we wd. put 2nd. figure at £30M. – over a useful field.  Therefore, favour settlement.  If we don’t, can’t see what comes out of mtg of 19/7.

	Thus, agree subject to proviso at x/.



A.E.	Agree to this settlement subject to x/. viz., warn Stassen we can’t wait indefinitely because of I/China : not in terms of unilateral action.



D.S.	Also ask him to make one further shot on rolling mills.  The U.S. argumts are not sound.  This is tin-plate – can’t be of value for defence prodn.  Argument re U.S. know-how applies only to one firm.



A.E.	Don’t nag at that.  Makins advises against it.

	I support line suggd. by H-Amory.



D.S.	There go on record that Stassen has agreed tht. rolling mills may be considered again later in year.



A.E.	Understand don’t want settle timing now : consider on 19/7 : but warn we shall be in diffy.

								[Exit H-Amory							[Enter Cherwell



	5.	Washington Talks.



P.M.	Can’t now give full a/c of all talks.

	Three minutes were agreed.  Egypt has bn circulated.  The other two 

	x//	shd. be circulated before to-morrow.

	Some advance on Atomic ques.

	Must, however, inform Cab. of project for mtg. with R.

	I had several talks with Eis. re Big Three Mtg.  He was quite open- minded about it.  Looked with favour on mtg in Ldn. 3 or 4 Power.  At one point said he wd. come first &amp; last on State visit – being rpd m’while by Nixon &amp; Dulles.  But twds end he gave impn. tht. he cdn’t press such a policy v. domestic advice.  But in public he said (N.Y. Herald Tribue: 1/7) this had bn. mentioned : timing must be judged etc., Can’t be sure Dulles wd. be equally well disposed twds this – or tht.  Congress wd. preclude Eis. from followg. his own instincts.

	On 4/5/53 I suggd. to Eis. tht. I shd. propose to Molotov tht. I shd. meet Malenkov.  Eis. then deprecated this.  Feared it wd. be a “solitary pilgrimage”.  Tho’ he admitted my right to go, if I thought fit.

	This time my conversations were on basis if 3 or 4 Power mtg.  But I had no reason to suppose they wd. seek to prevent my going alone.  D. tacitly accepted possibility that I might go alone.

	From ship I sent message to Molotov.  R.A.B. saw &amp; commented before despatch.  Reply received last p.m.  Delivered by Malik.  I told him I hadn’t yet consulted Cabinet – message was personal &amp; also tht. I hadn’t put matter specifically to Eisenhower.

	I at once sent message to Eis. – telling him of these exchanges – after consultn. with AE., RAB., Sal., HM.

	Suggest we defer forming opinion until we have Eis. views.  Then a decision must be taken on answer to Molotov.



A.E.	Must await Eis. reply.

	Troubled over European re-actions.  Adenauer’s posn. (his statement re E.D.C. : R. will want to kill it).  Other W. Eur. countries also will be concerned to a lesser extent.  Believe G. re-actions will be the most diff.



Sal.	Have reflected overnight.  No need for decns. to-day.

	My attitude will turn largely on temper of U.S. reply.  If he were critical or hostile, I shd. counsel abandoning this because of harm to U.S./U.K. relns. That over-rides all.  U.S. opinion is in a v. excited state.  M’while, I reserve my attitude.



H.M.	Cd. members see text of M’s message &amp; Eisenhower’s, when received.  Diff. to follow, if read only.  Special boxes –



P.M.	*	Yes : in runner boxes.

		U.S. can’t veto my visit.  They accept that.

	*	Series of telegrams last year (with Eis) will also be available in my Private Office to Ministers.

		Stockholm or Vienna is my preference. Don’t want to go to Moscow.

		My hope is thereafter a 4 Power Mtg in Ldn.  This wd. require a preliminary gesture by R : I wd. suggest, for this, indicn. of their readiness to conclude Austrian Treaty.

		Timing on 2 Power mtg.  Cdn’t happen until an issue reached in Geneva.  Cd. be mid/August.

									[Exit A.E.



		Atomic Questions.



Ch.		U.S. good will.  Hope law will be changed before Congress rises.  Until then, they wish nothg. said.  But they are ready to work with us, to limit.  Offered informn. re effect of H. bomb.  Also details of bomb fixings – so we cd. carry U.S. bombs.  Collaborn. on intelligence re R. work.  But involves disclosure of their bombs.  They hope to go further after law amended.  Atomic Bank – U.S. wish to go on.  We devised innocccuous formula Canadian tritium.  Canada offered to help us.  P.M. St. Laurent confirmed there wd. be no insuperable diffy.





		6.	Atomic Weapons Programme.



P.M.		Cab. must now decide wtr we shd. go on with m’fure of H. bomb.  Badge to R. Enclosure.

		Essential to m’tenance of deterrent.  This, in turms, depends on multiplicity of bases – to offset risk of effective surprise attack.  Must be able to make it clear to R. tht. they can’t stop effective retaliation.  That is only sure foundation for peace.  Power of effective reprisal must be assured.

		This makes it essential tht – we shd. make the H. bomb, &amp; play our part in this.



Sal.		Accept strategic argument.

		We have reached concln. tht. we shd. make H. bomb as well as atomic.  Taken preliminary steps.  One diffy. is scientific man-power.

		Can’t say more at present.



P.M.		Will Cab. approve in principle?  And endorse preliminary action taken.



H.C.		Wd. sooner have more time to reflect on this.



H.M.		Are we to make it – or put ourselves in a posn. to make it?
