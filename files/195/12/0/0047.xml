C. 65(54)							14th October, 1954



		Industrial Disputes.



		a)	Buses.



W.M.	T. Executive are putting out clear statement of actual issue.

	Hope that after a time they will go back to work.

	Some of those fomenting  the strikes are themselves working!



							[Enter J.B-C.

		b)	Docks.



W.M.	Deakin was advised not to go – by his own people.  Left it to Ldn. officials.

	His main fear is tht., if troops are used, other Unions will come out.

	He advised me to do nothg. until Mon. &amp; then appoint ct. of enquiry.

	But I have seen employers.  They advise leavg. it to run for a week.

	But it’s an official strike qua. Stevedores.  I can’t therefore ignore it.

	Yet can’t send for Stev. alone – implying they alone are to blame.

	Complete inaction, in present mood, won’t do.  Propose to send for all 3 parties, separately to-morrow : sending invitns. tonight.

	Nothing to negotiate upon – on “voluntary” overtime.  But cd. appeal to men to go back, with promise tht. everythg. can be discussed thereafter.  I cd. also indicate my intn. to appoint ct. of enquiry – urging them to go back while it’s sitting and suspend overtime ban.  They mght do first, not second.  Can’t promise ct. wd. produce results : but it wd. show we had done all we can.  Neither side wants it, but neither wd. boycott it.

	Wd. announce apptmt. of court to-morrow – or Sunday at latest – acc. to atmosphere of talks to-morrow.



A.E.	Doubt if it cd. wait beyond Fri. or Saty.  It’s a minimum step.



	Supplies.



Ll.G.	Qua food, no immediate shortage – before Thurs. next.



P.T.	Exports delayed at rate of £3 M. a day.  Orders will be switched if it becomes clear we can’t ship.



Sal.	Cd. Press be told this.  



P.T. 	They have the informn.



Sal.	Plug it – also bacon deteriorating.



B-C.	Ships are being diverted to continental ports.



		*Informn. to be fwdd. to M/L., who will release it. *



M.F.	Troops :  Dpts. are framing requiremts.  Min. Cttee. to meet Fri. p.m. to approve plans.



Al.	Army can produce 9.980 men w’out interrupting N.S. training – another 30,000 if we do.  8.000 fr. R.A.F.  9.000 fr. Navy.

	Thus we cd. do 10,000 easily – and rise to 50,000 if need be.

	Want 72 hrs!  notice to do it smoothly.



	Fife Clark to keep in touch with M/L. and M-F.
