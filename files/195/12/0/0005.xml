C. 17(54)								10th March, 1954



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter A.H., B.H.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Judges Bill : Mon. or Tues. in following week.



P.M.	Wd. prefer Tuesday.					Agreed.





		2.	Kenya.



S.W.		Changes contemplated by O.L. cd. be made w’out O-in-C.

		Cd. therefore be raised on adjournment.  Warn Leader of H. of C.





		3.	Egypt.



A.E.		Mrs. Castle’s motion.  Notices given on 8/3.

		What shall I do – shall I speak?  Shall I be there &amp; not speak.



H.M.		Make much of the words now omitted.



A.E.		Hope some Tories other than the 40 will speak on this.

		If it develops into attack on our f. policy, I shd. wish to speak.



B.H.		Spker may try to exclude f. policy – but doubt if he will succeed.



A.H.	She says she will talk only on condns. of troops.  But others will get on to f. policy matters.  I can decline to be drawn into that.



J.S.		Wd. strengthen speaker’s posn. if A.E.were not there.



P.M.	I agree.  Our line shd. be tht. this opportunity to discuss Army ques shd. not be denied to H/C.



H.C.	Yes – tho’ we shd. have to re-consider this if it did turn into a f. affairs 

debate.



										[Exit B.H.,

		4.	Persian Gulf.  Sharjah.



A.E.		Looks as tho’ Saudis my accept arbitrn.  V. important because of oil.

		Vital that our small show of force be m’tained.

		This is key to control of oil in P. Gulf.



Al.	Despair of reducing exp’re if we go on adding to commitments.  But if they are to stay we must build permanent accommn.

de L.		i) Not RAF. Regt.	ii) proper accommn.



P.M.		Can’t build in time available.  Mitigations only.



Al.		I will supply equivalent – not R.A.F., who shd. be relieved.



de L.		Shd. not be tents permanently.



RAB.		This summer – reliefs, or RAF flights : can’t get perm. accommn.



		Agreed:  Alex to make suitable arrangements and report.



R.A.B.		Always increases – no redns.



A.E.		I wd. gladly take them from Canal Zone for this.



R.A.B.		So would I.  Why don’t we?





		5.	Road Safety.



A.L.B.		As in memo.



L.P.	Value of research.  Diff. to get l.a.’s to adopt their findings.  Only progressive authies. do so.  May well have to consider mandatory powers.



A.L.B.	Head of Research stn. is about to become my chief engineer &amp; can put his views into practice.



		Town &amp; County – Ipswich &amp; Leicestershire.



R.A.B.		Will help

									[Exit A.L.B.



	6.	E.D. Community.



A.E.	W’ton tel. 405 gives text of Eisenhower’s proposed statement.  We must do more.  Suggested formula.



	(i) Para. 5 of memo.  Doesn’t tie us to specific numbers.



Ll.G.	“For next few years”??



A.E.	Shan’t be asked to define that.  More likely to be pressed for greater precision on level of forces.



	Also – no intentn. of w’drawing so long as threat exists.



	(ii) Massigli said last night tht. a Br. divn. under E.D.C. command wd. settle it.  Para. 7 of my memo. meets this.



P.M.	Don’t wish to be committed to stay in Europe after U.S. w’draws.



A.E.	Brussels Treaty commits us to participate in Eur. defence – olign. not shared by U.S.  But no firm commitment to keep troops in Europe in peace longer than U.S.



Al.	If this is only way of getting E.D.C. ratified, we must do this.  Militarily, of course, I wd. sooner not put a Br.divi. under f. command.



P.M.	A good investment – if we can get ratification for this.



A.E.	Yes : cheap at the price.



R.A.B.	Tel 874 to w’ton : &amp; message pre B’muda.

	Once EDC is in &amp; G. consn. is running, we shall lose a G. contn. amountg. prs. to increase of £80M. in our exp’re.  If we tie ourselves to this as first charge on our defence, we must be prepd. to make a reduction elsewhere.  But let that be understood.  Can’t have net increase in overseas cost of defence.

	I myself regard Europe as priority &amp; am ready to accept this as a commitment.



A.E.	This is our offer.  It is not negotiable.  They take it or leave it.



	Approved.							[Enter D.E.





	7.	Carlton House Terrace.



P.M.	Shd. we embark on this, at cost of £7M., to enable F.O. to leave its traditional home.  Facade will not be improved by increased height.



A.E.	Whole situation re Govt. bldgs is v. complicated.  Is Horseferry Rd. best place, e.g., for M.I.5?  I cd. stay in Downing St. if remainder of my staff cd. be concentrated in H. Rd.



D.E.	No diffy. in finding tenants for old F.O. bldg.



L.P.	Science Centre on S. Bank: approved in principle, by H.A. Cttee.  How is this related in priority?



W.	And are we assuming sufficient redn. in size of bureaucracy.



P.M.	We shd. stem rising tide of bureaucracy.

	Hope F.O. will remain where they are.  And Nash facade will stay as is.  Wd. be much criticism of this plan.



D.E.		Won’t fall down for 10 years.

		But £130,000 already paid to architect in fees.

		Someday a decision will have to be taken by someone.



H.M.	Nobody can live in private houses.  What are we to do with them?  Force to consent to conversion to offices – e.g. in Berkeley Square.  This is noticeable in Carlton House Terrace.



T.D.	Crown Lands – trustees for good adminn.  Will fall down 1961.  Must know what Cab. wants to do.  Wd. be v. suitable for offices.



Sw.		Diff. to justify the expense, at present time.



H.C.		Cd. it be turned into hotel.  Ritz (Paris) preserved old facade.



D.E.	Commercial developer can’t accept addl. 50% involved in keeping facade.



P.M.	Cttee. of Ministers can consider in recess.  Inclined to do Richmond Terrace first.

										[Exit J.S.

										[Exit D.E.

		8.	Coloured Workers.



M.F.		As in memo.

	Advise firm refusal of Cttee. because it wd. raise whole ques of colour bar 

J.S. supports that view.

	Considn. (by me) of deportn. powers can continue.



Sw.		Power to deport wd. be adequate deterrent to immigration.

		Are opposed to Cttee. of enquiry.



Sal.	In 10-15 years’ time this may be unmanageable.

	Cd we not have Comm. Confce. to get uniformity of immigration laws?  I don’t believe deportn. alone will be enough.  Shall need to regulate entry.



H.M.	Cdnt. we start with deportn. powers.  Entry control is dangerous – don’t incite India to exclude our immigrants.  Get your deportn. powers first.





	9.	High Commission Territories.



P.M.	We will not hand these over to Malan.

	He may continue anti-Br. policy in consequence.

	If they renounced allegiance, I believe Natal might secede fr. Union.  But doubt if Malan will re-act v. violently.  Suits him to be violent in domestic policy but calm in inter-Comm. relns.



Sw.	I have no excuse to warn High Commr. – for my sources can’t be disclosed.

	We cdn’t reject request for conversations.

	Economic pressure on territories cd. easily be applied by them.

	Will go on trying to stop Malan making this a public issue.

	When I get chance to speak to them, will ask RAB. to send personal message to Havenga.
