C. 43(54)							22nd June, 1954



		1.	Egypt.			[Enter Serv. Min., C.O.S., Profumo



A.E.	Duration : wd. ask for 20 yrs.  Might get 12 or 10.

	Shd. have to press for 2 yrs. (vice 15 mos.) for w’drawal.

	i)  What U.S. help?  Minimum : public statement of support for our reasonable demands &amp; priv. threat linking this with their aid.

	Also statement at some stage re navign. thro’ Canal.

	ii) Do we say anything to E. before going to W’ton.  Don’t want to seem to be re-opening talks at U.S. behest.  Enough to say tht. we may have something to say to them on our return.

	Welcome new approach by C.O.S. defining our limited needs in the Base.



Sal.	No option but to get agreement if we can.

	If we have to move out, essential to have U.S. associated with us in that.

	Won’t be popular here – but less unpopular than a year ago.

	Presentn. : better as re-alignment than as shuffling off burden too heavy for us to carry.



Al.	Value of Base is altered greatly by H-bomb.  A concentrated Base like this offers a most tempting target – men as well as stores.

	This alone wd. be good reason to re-deploy.

	Size of Base (not heard)

	Technicians     ..     ..

	W’drawal period: longer time is necessary to w’draw more equipment if civil technicians only are to be there.

	Period of agreement: less important than w’drawal period.

	We are anxious to move M/E H.Q. to Cyprus as soon as poss. Mil. advantages outweigh objn. tht. this will put ideas into E. head.



Sw.	Presentn. as by Sal. &amp; Alex. will go better with old Doms, whom we have invited to send troops there.  Their thinking is not up to date.

	Cyprus story likely to leak out soon.  Shd. be considered (M/D &amp; F.O.) wtr some official statement shd. not be ready.



A.H.	Press have known of large camp at Dakalia, but not H.Q. at Episcopi.

	Used to idea of re-deployment of troops.



W.	Can we be sure of getting civilian technicians?  Have contractors bn. asked?



A.H.	Wimpeys, Unilever &amp; F.B.I. unwilling but wd. do it if asked.  Will be expensive &amp; inefficient.



Profu.	A.L.B.’s interest in getting internl. support for security of transit thro’ Canal.  Shd. be early review of Cab. of this – as requested by Cab. in Jan.

P.M.	Agreed : our posn. in E. is not militarily advantageous.  My concern is with effect on public opinion here of a w’drawal.  Deep feelings will be aroused.  Posn. we have held since ’82.  If worth doing, is worth doing altogether.  But cd. we take some of the edge off it by U.S. association – as in NATO or SEATO.  Prefer therefore to see how our talks go in W’ton, before we ask for renewal of negotiations.

	Present it there as part of a world plan – includg. substitution of SEATO for ANZUS.  That outweighs risk tht. E. will say U.S. have bidden us to negotiate.  Moreover, we want this card in talks with U.S.

	Arms held up until 3 of 6.  They want us to talk to E. : let us get something from them in return for agreeing to do so.

	Sudan – dismissal of B. officials is not going to help us with U.K. opinion on E.

	Future effect on Tory Party – of these developments in E. &amp; S.  Sound from military angle.  But S. will be model for future in Africa generally.

	U.S. association is only means I see of mitigating these effects.



A.E.	Worse posn. if were fighting a united S. nation.  Countries nowadays prefer to rule themselves – it is a fact of modern life.

	Diff. to guess what U.S. will do to help us over E.  We shan’t keep it dark tht. we are discussing E. in W’ton.  D. will prob. say that we have bn. told to discontinue our Colonialism in E.  Not easy to link this re-deployment with SEATO.



P.M.	Must be ready to meet pressure of U.S. opinion if Hanoi falls.  We can only do so by building up our positn. in Malaya : can’t co-operate in intervention in Indo-China.



A.E.	U.S. are intensely disliked in M/E.  U.S. assocn. with us won’t help us in negotiating with E.



P.M.	I admit that.  But it wd. help here &amp; with world opinion, esp. if it covered Canal.



A.E.	That is a different issue – we can at this stage only have general words about it.  Canal Convention is diff. fr. Anglo/E. Treaty.

	U.S. assocn. won’t help us anywhere in M/E.  Even in H/C. it won’t help to have it said that we acted at behest of U.S.

	All I want is to say to E. is – no chance to talk earlier because I have bn. away but hope tht. on return fr. W’ton I may have some commn. to make to them.  That wdn’t commit us to much.



P.M.	Prefer to rely, for protn. v. being criticised for acting at U.S. behest, on hope of decln. of Anglo/U.S. co-opn. over a wider front.



Sw.	You have outlined all that in yr. message to Eisenhower.



P.M.	It is 18 mos. since we discussed with U.S. basis for E. def. agreement.

	Not a new idea tht. we shd. have U.S. assocn. in this.



A.E.	Cd. put it to E. tht. we note improvemt. in condns. in Canal Zone : we hope they will continue to improve condns. in Zone : for only improvemt. there will induce us to resume talks.



P.M.	Wd. sooner have it put that way.



A.E.	Will submit my formula to P.M. before I speak to Egyptians.

	Heads of Agreement approved, as basis for discn. in W’ton.

	No concessions to be made, on this, to U.S. pressure.



RAB.	Hope sterling releases may be authorised as soon as negotiations begin.

	Tho’ they are quite calm at present.

	Want to get rid of some of it during summer – so as not to run into fixed paymt. to be made next January and repayment of U.S. debt.



							            [Exit Profumo.



		2.	Geneva Conference.				[Enter H.M.



A.E.	Para. 4 of C. 207.

	On (d) method of separate private approach to all is far better than public mtg. attended only by the 10 who will come.



Sw.	On (c) A &amp; N.Z. will want to go further and faster to ensure tht. U.S. interest is not lost.



A.E.	(d) shd. meet them on that.

	Kind of pact depends on Geneva.  If there were agreemt., it wd. be Locarno form – guarantees by both sides.  If no agreement, defensive N.A.T.O. form.  Ready to discuss privately with U.S., if they wd. keep it dark.  Cd. prs. safeguard v. leaks by discussing both.

	Not sure U.S. wd. accept Locarno form, involving agreemt. with other side.



Sw.	Cd. have SEATO as well as Locarno.  That wd. meet them.



A.E.		Even if Hanoi fell, there wd. be point in continuing to seek agreemt. at 		Geneva on basis of partition.  Fr. don’t hope to secure more than S of		Viet Nam plus Laos &amp; Cambodia.



P.M.	Emotional reaction at fall of Hanoi may draw U.S. into intervention – while Phase I continues.  The China lobby are reckless.



A.E.	Is (f) accepted?     



P.M. 	Yes.

			     Memo. approved.



A.E.	Drew attentn. to Canadian Amb. report on talk with Chou-en-lai.



		

		3.	Atomic Energy.  Atomic “Bank” Plan.



Sal.	R. have now rejected plan.  U.S. have enquired wtr we shd. go on alone.

	Believe opinion in W’ton may be divided.  State &amp; Def. Dpts. are v. it.

	We don’t feel keen on plan save for bringing R. in.  W’out that political advantage, we stand to lose rather than gain fr. Plan.

	Cttee. advised tht. we shd. discourage going fwd. &amp; inform Doms.

	Tho’, if Eisenhower pressed it, we shd. acquiesce.

	Gather, however, tht. A.E. wd. prefer to press for it to be dropped.

	Disadvantages clearly outweigh the gain.



Sw.	Esp. when it is clear on Disarmament Cttee. tht. R. won’t play at all on any disarmament scheme.



A.E.	If R. won’t come in, we shd. judge purely on self-interest.  Pool wd. lose us advantage of being able to sell to others, who cd. draw on pool.  No point in makg. that sacrifice, if R. stand out.

	Urge U.S. to go no further at present, while R. declines to come in.



		Agreed.

							[Exit Serv. Min., C.O.S.



		4.	East/West Trade.



P.T.	Stassen wishes to p’pone enforcemt. of our agreed relaxations on trade to Soviet bloc by reference to developmts. in Indo-China. Seems mistaken to link these two. Wish to tell him so, &amp; urge we go on quietly with discns.



A.E.	I agree.



P.T.	Will concert with F.O. terms of a telegram.



								[Exit A.E.

		5.	Dr. Cort.					[Enter B.H.



M.F.	Have received deputn.

	Don’t propose to change decision; for i) Cort has continued Communist connections ii) risk tht. he will be deprived of U.S. citizenship.  iii) political asylum wd. imply tht. his life &amp; liberty are in danger in U.S. because of his political opinions.

	Any contrary decisions wd. be ill-received in U.S.

	Admit there will be trouble in H/C.



P.M.	Liberal opinion in U.K. will be offended by this decision.

	Don’t under-rate that.



M.F.	Alternative involves my saying tht. U.S. Govt. are using forms of law to cover political persecution.





		6.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Finance Bill 7th. Cttee. day on 28/6.  Will that finish it?



RAB.	Fear not.  Another day will be needed.



H.C.	Normal length was 6 days.  Ch/Ex. won’t use closure.



R.A.B.	Don’t believe in it : have never used it since Ch/Ex.



H.C.	Knowledge of this makes people talk much more.

	x|	Cd. RAB. make a deal with Opposn. to finish by 7 p.m. on 29/6.



B.H.	Opposition Ch. Whip is urging use of closure.

							          [Exit Ll.G.

RAB.	Will try x/.



H.C.	May have to hold debate on Crichel Down vice one day of Mines &amp; Quarries Bill.  Tho’ I shall try to defer that until P.M.’s return fr. W’ton.



P.M.	May not be back until 6/7 if I come by Q.E.





		7.	Members’ Expenses.



P.M.	After RAB’s departure last night Cab. were virtually unanimous in favour of the subsistence plan.



R.A.B.	Here is a draft.



P.M.	Can we announce this w’out telling Opposn.?



Sal.	Omit [  ] – which suggests possibility of a bargain.  Agreed.



R.A.B.	Add the para. on pensions.

	Tell Opposn., routine way, 30 minutes before statement made Thursday.



P.M.	Shd. like to know their attitude.  R.A.B.  We shd. have to disclose our plan.



		Agreed : statement to be made on Thursday.
