C. 49(54)								9th July, 1954

							

		1.	Washington Talks.		               [Enter B.H.



P.M.		Further message from Eisenhower.

		Have an answer in draft.  Read it out.

		Ask the Cab. to take note.



Sal.	I am unalterably opposed to mtg. with R. without U.S.

	I opposed Labour’s recogn. of China – has created breach wh. hasn’t bn closed.

	I told you last year why I was opposed to this.

	This is a gt. step in f. policy.  I couldn’t commend it to H/L., as spokesman for F.O.

	Other members of Cab. may think it is right to go fwd.  But, if they so decided, I shd. have to resign.



P.M.	I have said in H/C. 3 times I wdn’t hesitate to go, if it seemed profitable.

	But we must all keep in mind the view wh. L.P. has expd.

	I do not ask for a decision to-day.  We can take that final decision when Eisenhower’s final views are known.





		2.	Indo-China.



A.E.	Signs tht. U.S. Minister might not return to Geneva.

	Dulles has explained to French why they aren’t.  They have told them, while they wd. contribute to united front, they must know on what that was based.  Must know Fr. intentions.  Think therefore it wd. be better to avoid any dramatic dissociation at Geneva.  They will stand by ready to come at once if sitn. warrants it.

Am urging them to come.

	Looks serious – if they are unwilling to support modified Locarno.  Discns. in W’ton : U.S. at first were ready to join in joint declaration : cd. do no more than make separate decln.  Diff to avoid concln. tht. U.S. don’t want agreemt. reached. cf. statement in Eis’ latest message : we have always bn. in favour of internationalising the conflict.

	C. 227.  Map.



S.W.	Para 5.  Views of A. &amp; N.Z. wd. also be important – not only Colombo Powers.  A &amp; N.Z. are loth to dissociate themselves fr. U.S.



A.E.	Suppose a compromise betwn lines A &amp; B. were acceptable to all save U.S. we shall be in v. gt. diffy.

	If no agreemt. at Geneva, or agreemt. with U.S. dissociated from it, that wd. affect project for Berne.



P.M.	If no solution found, surely all the more important to get good understandg with R. – to prevent them giving more support to China, &amp; to re-assure world opinion.



A.E.	R. wd. be to blame if China wd. not settle.  She cd. force a settlement.



P.M.	But don’t help to unite them.

	Tho’ clear tht. upshot at Geneva is relevant to Berne.

	No reason why A.E. shd. not discuss Berne project with M.



A.E.	Most consider how M. wd. re-act to pr. suggn. re Austria.  I think he wd. put fwd. his Eur. security system – fatal to E.D.C.  Also he will discuss N.A.T.O. – suggesting R. &amp; G. inclusion (fr. first).  They will urge tht. broader mtg shd. be on 5 Power basis.  I put these points because they will have to be considered while I am Geneva.



P.M.	You can tell M. tht. “Berne” can’t be pursued while Geneva is uncertain.  Try him out on mtg. places.

	If Geneva fails, will be some relief to world opinion tht. another jaw is in view.



A.E.	Must say something in H/C next week re EDC. – viz., tht. we may be going on with Bonn agreements.  Cd. be done in P.M.’s speech.  Point is we may bring into force during recess, some part of agreements wh. Parlt. has ratified.						Agreed.

	U.S. are announcg. this to Congress on Wednesday.



A.E.	Repn. of China in U.N.  Submitted draft of messge to Doms.  Revised to take a/c of all points made.					Agreed.



L.P.	H/Lords.  Question by Stansgate on Monday.

	Best to repeat P.M.’s statement in H/C. &amp; decline to answer supplementaries.



P.M.	Was intending to make it rather informally.



L.P.	Then I will tell him P.M. is speaking &amp; invite him to study it.





	3.	Overseas Information Services.



A.E.	Cd.we not have decision?



RAB.	M.F. Cttee. recommn. were made w’out regard to Sw. Cttee. recommns.  Diff. to justify to other Dpts. picking this out for earlier &amp; more favourable treatment.



A.E.	£1.8 M expansion over 3 yrs – Drogheda.  I proposed over 5 yrs.  MF Cttee. says 7 yrs.  I wd. accept the least.  But v. important.



Sw.	Agreemt. on exp’re in current year.  My Cttee. have recommended redn. to £9½ M. next year.  That report will be ready next week.  This will yield economy of £¾M., as cpd. with this year.



R.A.B.	Unjust to others to give this to F.O. now.



H.M.	Cabinet will have to consider all recommns. of Swinton Cttee.  They are all subject to Cabinet discussion.



RAB.	Have bn. sympathetic to F.O. therefore of their special difficulties.



M.F.	Our recommn. was subject to para. 8 – annual review of expenditure.



A.E.	Wd. not have brght this up if I hadn’t to be in Geneva when Swinton Rpt. came to Cabinet.
