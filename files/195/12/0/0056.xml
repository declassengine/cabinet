C.74(54)							10th November 1954



		1.	Parliament.				[Enter Reading, P.B.H.



H.C.	Business for next week,.

	O.A.P. – Vote of Censure.  16/11. : 2 days’ before W. Derby By-Election.

	Speakers : O.P. (opus) : Cab. Min. to reply – to be settled 11/11 with P.M.

	Debate on Germany : 17-18/11.  A.E. open : A.N. reply.  2nd Day H.M. to open : A.E. reply.

	Business (provisional) for following week.





		2.	Rabbits : Myxamatosis.



H.A.	Pests Bill.  Cttee. stage : to-day.

	Motion suggestg. it be made offence to spread myxamatosis – by equal nos. of Tory &amp; Labour M.P.’s.

	Our policy has bn. to prevent its being spread.  But, on recommn. of Adv. Cttee., have opposed making it offence.  It won’t stop the spread : it’s already all over U.K. : we cdn’t enforce a statutory prohibn.

	We cd. now take any of 3 courses.

	i) Opposn. to motion wd. risk defeat.

	ii) We cd. be conciliatory – indicatg. readiness to legislate later if positive evce. of spreading it.

	iii) Accept amendmt.  Wd. be volte face : contary to Adv. Cttee. : wd. irritate farmers.



P.M.	Spreading this is a vile and odious action.

	Leave it to free Vote.



Sal.	Can’t be retrospective.  Most of harm is done.  Invidious.  If we were going to do this, we shd. have done it at start.



P.M.	Opinion takes some time to form.



H.A.	Wd. sooner accept amendmt. than have free Vote.



B.H.	Think we may be defeated if we don’t.



J.S.	Bad legn. – but won’t make any difference.



		Agreed : Govt. to accept the amendment.

 

		3.	Agriculture : Administrative Tribunals.



H.A.	Appeal decision on constitn. of tribunals.

	We have, by winning this, establd. principle.

	Am considering, however, what to do on particular case.



W.	Be quick about it.  There will be pol. ferment otherwise.



							[Enter B-C., Ward, A.N.

		4.	Royal Flights.



P.M.	Must be based, not on inconvenience to R.N. training, but on fact that it is not effective.



Sal.	Need it be announced?  



P.M. 	No.

							            [Exit B.C.



		5.	Army &amp;Air Force Acts.			[Enter A.H.



A.H.	Prelimy. debate Friday.  Shd. indicate our intentns.  Wd. like to welcome report &amp; promise legn. in spring.  3 Bills – 1 Army 1 RAF. 1 Transitional.

	Thereafter annual renewals by O-in-C. for periods of 5 years : viz., no amendment save at 5-year intervals.



H.C.	Hope we can be vague about this at present.  Pretty revolutionary.

	Don’t want to be committed to it (Sel. Cttee. plan) yet.

	Doubt if future Parliaments can be bound like this.



Att.G	Mutiny definition i) will extend to go-slow action on repairs.  Good.  ii) scope : 2 or more B. soldiers combining to resist authy. of Portuguese sergeant.  Cab. shd. be aware of this.



P.M.	Content : a Br. court wd. be the judge of the merits.



H.M.	Relief at unanimity of Select Cttee.  Wise therefore to indicate broad acceptce. of recommns.  Then we can hope to get Bills passed w’out controversy.



P.M.	In transitional period provns. affectg. human life will need to be administered in light of changes to be made (death penalty).



		Memo. approved.

							[Exit AN., AH., Ward.



 

		6.	Uganda Protectorate.



A.L.B.	As in memo.

	Politically, we shall have diffies. with supporters of ours, who have commd. themselves to final exclusion of Mutesa.



Sw.	Will help with this, &amp; with Seretse, if this is represented as flowing fr. the judgemt.  – not as a change of policy.

	Wd. like chance to discuss details of statement.



A.L.B.	Wd. like that – Sw., K. and Att.G.

	Suggest we announce this not as condl. on appeal : leaving me free to discourage appeal.



P.M.	Let A.L.B. discuss at once with Kabaka.



		Agreed.	Course in memo. approved.

				Statement to be settled by ALB., K., Sw., &amp;

 			Att.G.  

A.L.B. to discuss with Mutesa.



H.C.	V. long statement for oral.  Cd. full version be circulated in Wh. Paper?  



A.L.B. 	Very well.  Statement on 16/11 not 17/11 as stated in memo.



							            [Exit Att.G.

		7.	Persia.						[Enter Low.



R.	Object of earlier loan was to support P. economy.  It was not taken up, mainly because U.S. money made it unnecessary.

	We now suggest £10 M. at 3½% – not  to prop Persian economy but to facilitate Br. exports, &amp; get our share of the market.

	Political advantages are now subsidiary to economic.

	Want  3½% (vice 4%) to avoid spoiling its effect.



R.A.B.	Have agreed to double the amount.  Suggest 3% for 1st. year and 4% thereafter.  Otherwise I shall be accused of subsidising exports.



R.	May we try this on Persians – coming back to R.A.B. if they make a lot of fuss.



R.A.B.	Rely on argument of Pakistan loan 4%.  Don’t want better terms for P. than for Doms.



Low.	We attach equal importce. to exports, but support Ty. view on interest.



							           [Exit Low

								Reading

		





		8.	Pensions.					[Re-enter B.H.



O.P.	Figures. – specially  secret.



	War Pensions.	100% rate to be increased to 67/6.  50% above 1951

	War Widows.	52/6d.  50% above ’51.

	N.I. Benefits.  Basic pension : from 32/6 to 40/=. Married 54/= to 65/=.

		 	Sickness:           similar increases.

			Unemployment       ..         ..

	Increased contributions : based on Actuary’s Rpt :  only 11d. each plus 1d. for Ind. Injuries.  Concession to self-employed : only increase payable by employed.

	Time-table.

	Can’t improve on this w’out serious risk of b’down.

	There was a serious muddle when Socialists tried to do similar thing in 2 months.

		Nat. Assistce.  Bd. is independent &amp; Govt.  Cannot bring any pressure 		on them.  Bd = 2 Tories 1 Lib and 3 Labour.  Chairman is unwilling to

	seem to be yielding to public clamour.  Present scales are adequate : &amp; in 1 case out of 3 discretionary addns. are being made.  He wd. like to increase  by 2/6 and 4/=.  But in ordinary course, w’out emergency mtg.  This means 24/11 before Bd. makes this recommn.  1¾ m. order books will then have to be changed.  Working fr. 24/11, this means tht. end/Jan. is earliest date for coming into operation of increased scales.

	Seek approval for i) time-table  ii) rates  iii) priority to be given, in payment, to war pensions.  iv) no special Xmas box.



H.C.     	1) 2nd. Rdg. 21/12 is latest day.  Diff. if Rpt. not available until 15/12.  Can’t be a moment later.  2) What of Phillips Rpt?



R.A.B.	These plans (on figures) are based on Actuary’s Rpt.  This shows tht. existg. basis for contns. is too high.

	Phillips Cttee. hope to finish this week.  We have waited on them because ques wtr we shd. raise age of retirement (because of eventual burden of pensions).  Now seems they won’t be agreed on that.  But we may get from them support for increase contns.

	Hope O.P. will press Assce. Bd. to aim at earlier date than end/Jan.

	Cost to Exchequer.  Because of loss of tax, may cost £27-30 M.  Can carry that burden.

	Details e.g. tobacco) can await another Cabinet.



O.P.	(In reply to P.M.)  The numbers who are too proud to go for Assistce. are not large.  Can’t risk whole plan by attempting, for their sake, to do it all quicker.



H.M.	Three things are linked – i) Assistce.  ii) War Pensions, by Order.  iii) N.I. wh. requires a Bill.  On (iii) we must be able to show we legislated as soon as Rpts were available.  We cdn’t do it more quickly.  Must say all adminve. prepns. are started as soon as 2nd. Rdg taken – w’out losing time of Xmas Recess.  On (ii) we have a good case on earlier date now proposed.



		Discussion adjourned.
