C. 73(54)							5th November, 1954



		1.	Defence Policy.		[Enter 3 Serv. Ministers, C.O.S., 							 S.Ll.



P.M.	Main issue outstanding – Naval Air.  Aircraft complement for heavy carriers which are to be used in escort role.



C.N.S.	For war at sea many small craft lightly armed.  To protect them from enemy heavy forces, there must be a covering force – as Home Fleet did in ‘39/45.  Modern equivalent = heavy carriers capable of strike v. enemy surface ships.  Our contn. is 2 heavy carriers with proper complement of aircraft.  (U.S. asked us for 3.)



A.N.	Its capacity to strike at land targets is purely incidental.



Sw.	Monty in recent address said that what N.A.T.O. wanted of Navy was light escort carriers.



A.E.	He’s not the authority qua N.A. Alliance.  



H.M. 	Saclant is authy. for this.



A.E.	Must preserve our posn. as Naval power and our NATO Commands.



C.N.S.		Norway’s concern with early days of war, when U.S. Fleet will not be 		available.



A.N.	60 aircraft with 6 strike as cpd. 30 with 4 strike.

	But heavy carrier is self-contained.



P.M.	Why haven’t R.N. made any contn. by reducg. aircraft reserves.  Then they mght have retained more discretion as to use – I wdn’t press that.



A.N.	We offered £25 M cut at outset, with large redns. in Naval Air – before Cttee. started.  Since then, we have accepted further cuts in Naval Air.  Only reserve is 50 aircraft, to enable carriers to work overseas.



H.M.	Hope Cab. will accept report as a whole, leaving over these few issues for further discn. – esp. in absence of First Lord.

	Alex. accepted some, but not all, of these recommns.

	Agreed there shd. be 4 carriers in commn.  Don’t make arbitrary decisions now on their role.

	May I have opportunity to discuss these disputed items?

	And make a further report to Cabinet?



P.M.	R.N. have 900 odd aircraft and only 300 odd are operational.



H.M.	We are going to try to work towards £1525 m. figure.  I will do my best, with Service Ministers, to keep w’in that.



	May I do it, w’out binding decn. on role of carriers?



D.S.	If general basis of Rpt is accepted, &amp; figure taken as aim, we needn’t be dogmatic about strategic role.



Sw.	Endorse all remaining recommns. which are agreed.

	Equipment of heavy carriers.  Involves £2 M. this coming year.

	Future is even more important.  Don’t be committed to v. large expanding exp’re on developmt. and prodn. of new types of strike aircraft.



H.M.	Shall keep that in view.



P.M.	In light of increasg. range of shore-based aircraft.



S.H.	Effect on emplt. of proposed cancelln. of Seamews.  £1.2 m. next year.

	20 half-completed.  Cancelln. of contract will cost £1½ m.



P.M.	Met by last sentence of para. 12.



H.M.	We must consider and make separate report on this.



RAB.	Stress x/ in para. 8.  We haven’t resolved this yet.  Seamews ordered &amp; then found to be not what is now wanted,.

	On Naval Air we look like losing £3 M. or so.  And I still am lookg. for £10 – will now be £13 M.

	Hope we may aim at £1525 as maximum.



Sal.	Role of “covering force”.  Are we sure tht. this cdn’t be done in future by shore-based aircraft.  We need time to be sure on this.



A.E.	Not clear tht. U.K. duties are prescribed sufficiently by N.A.T.O.  E.g. if we give Norway assurance they need, we cd. ask for relief elsewhere.  Secondly, cd. assurance be given equally to Norway by shore-based vice carrier-borne aircraft.



de L.	Money limit enforces on us an observance of priorities.

	We are falling behind in developmt. of modern aircraft.

	Strategy must be considered w’in limits of what we can afford.

	But Norway is w’in range of our medium bomber force.



A.E.	y/ in para. 33.  We ought to be able to rely on U.S. - thro’ N.A.T.O.

	NATO assigns shares of Forces but, not enough, strategic duties.



H.M.	U.S. Strategic Air Force is outside N.A.T.O.  It wd. be for us to agree with U.S. bi-laterally.



de L.	And they won’t make any deal with us until we have some bombers.

	And even then they won’t look after us.



A.L.B.	Para. 19.  Slow on H-Kong because of Quemoy.



A.H.	We are double-bunked in H-Kong.  Must have decn. in 3/4 months.



A.E.	Yes.  And sooner out of Korea the better.



A.H.	Colonial Forces.  Best means of long-term saving on Army.  Also will enable more disorders to be prevented.  Shd. be major aim of policy, wd. like Min. Cttee. on it.  



A.L.B. 	Wd. welcome that.



P.M.	Cd. Templer be used on this?			(Approved.

							(H.M. to arrange.

H.M.	Minesweepers.  24 over 4 years.



C.N.S.	Threat of mines to big ports is less.  But greater at small ports.

	For this we wanted 40 over 4 years.



P.M.	24 over 4 years &amp; consider it later.



A.N.	Accept that but warning re effect on N.Ireland.



A.E.	Canal Zone w’drawal.  We have given time-table to contractors : unwise to upset them.  They don’t want to do it at all.



						[Exit A.N., C.N.S., de L. C.A.S.

		2.	Austria.



A.E.	U.S. annoyed tht. we didn’t tell them of our decn. to reduce troops in Austria.  Now they suggest, in view of Trieste, we add 1 Battn. and they add 2 Battns. to show increased protn.  Grunther favours it : thinks they shd. be w’in NATO : we don’t.

	Politically, undesirable.  Militarily, probably useless.



P.M.	If we don’t want it politically, that ends it.



R.A.B.	Wd. sooner move one fr. Germany, if at all.



A.H.	Plan is tht. they shd. w’draw into Italy in war because they have no tail.



C.I.G.S.	It wd. be mil. nonsense to re-inforce as proposed.

	And fr. our U.K. pt. of view wrong to put another battn. there w’out logistic support.



H.M.	[Unheard.]  4 Divns. in Eur. can’t do more : Grunther can suggest transfer.



A.E.	Wd. be expensive – wd. have to recover barracks surrendered to Austrians.



		A.E. &amp; M/D. to concert terms of negative answer.





		3.	Formosa.



A.E.	Treaty seems parallel to Phillipines Treaty – with no clause re privileged sanctuary.  That wd. increase the tension.

	U.S. fear early attack on islands.  Seekg. confirmn. of that.

	But begins to look as tho’ Oracle has little prospect of success.

	N.Z. are as unhappy as we.

							[Exit A.H., C.I.G.S.



		4.	Uganda.



A.L.B.	Cd. we wait until we have full judgement.  Summary may be misleading.  May be that what it means is : we did the right thing in the wrong way.



P.M.	V. well.  But don’t miss this chance of getting Kabaka back.



Att.G.	Found tht. K. was disloyal : but tht. we weren’t justified in w’drawing recognition under agreemt. – tho’ they cd. as an act of State.

	But prefer to read full judgement.

							[Exit Att.G.



		5.	Industrial Disputes : Docks.



W.M.		i)	More worried that at any time since ’51.  So are T.U.C.

			Tally-clerks cd. stop whole docks again.  Issues i) pay ii) 				non-union clerks.  Hope T &amp; G. W. Union will compose this.

			Also dockers’ demand for 100%. Union membership for all 			who come into docks.  Dust hasn’t settled.

		ii)	Municipal ’buses.  Again because of opposn. to T &amp; G W. 				leadership.

		iii)	Rlways.  Footplate workers.

		iv)	Engineering wages claim.  Talk of strike to bring it to a head.

		v)	Steel erectors on Ldn. sites.  Strike, already in progress.

				Most of this is due to attempt of Left-wing in T.U.

				movement to unseat Right-wing leaders.

				W.F.T.U. had a plan to stir all this up, in order to

				disrupt our prosperity.
