C. 23(54)							31st March, 1954



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter B.H., de L.



H.C.	Speakers in Budget Debate.



R.A.B.	Maudling to speak second. viz., on Thursday.

	Either Fin. Secy. or another Cab. Minister on followg. Monday – spkg. first, before I wind up at end.



H.C.	Must there be debate on H. bomb?  My view is tht. there must &amp; tht. we shd. keep initiative by offering it.  We cd. do it on Mon. next – leaving Housing Bill until Thurs.  Only loss wd. be remaing. stages of Atomic Bill, wh. wd. then have to stand over until after Easter.

	Alternative is 14/4 – last operative day &amp; poor attendance.



P.M.	Sooner the better.  Mon. wd. suit me.

	I will speak first (or second).

	I intend to publish Quebec Agreement on date of debate, after consultn. with Eisenhower.  Think he would consent : but will publish even if he doesn’t.  First (U.S.) draft of history of our Collaborn., as agreed at B’muda, will not be available before end of month – too late for this debate.



	Speakers : P.M. and A.E.



A.E.	Motion on Entente Cordiale – Thurs.

	Will be moved by Private Members of both Parties.  A.E. will bless it thereafter.



H.C.	Sorry that Edelman (Labour) shd. be the mover.



A.E.	He represents as Chairman Franco-British Cttee. wh. has done all the work.





		2.	Remuneration of Members.



R.A.B.	Have drafted Parly. statement on basis i) no increase in salaries

	ii) ready to give help in kind  iii) invite debate for expn. of opinion.

	Difficulty over (ii) is that it doesn’t help London members.



J.S.	They have no expenses.



P.M.	Paper to be circulated : on scheme for help in kind

	Cab. next week.

	Favour early statement on those lines, prs. by L.P.S.







		3.	Hydrogen Bomb.



		Longer answer – as written.  If w’drawn, give same informn. in debate 		on Monday next.

							       [Exit B.H.

							       [Enter Serv. Min. &amp; C.O.S.

		4.	Jordan.				



Al.	This military plan cd. not, I recognise, be put into opn. – for pol. reasons.

	But diff. situation.  Treaty oblign. to make plans.  Mtg. of Def. Bd. due next week. Can’t easily p’pone it again.

	Prs. a simpler plan.  Object : prevent Jews fr. attackg. Arabs : best way is to make it clear tht., if they do, they will encounter us.  Cd. we not ensure this by sending our armoured troops to train with Jordan forces on the route fr. frontier.



A.E.	Treaty includes oblign. to try &amp; seek solution by peaceful means.  We can stress J. duty in that regard.

	Risk is Israeli action despite P.M.’s sounder view.

	Wd. be useful to encourage him to caution – by message from P.M.



P.M.	At mtg. do not table this detailed plan.  Take line tht. peaceful means must be followed : urge them to avoid provocation : say that, if worst came, U.N. wd. be concerned.

	I cd. certainy not take responsibility for declaring war on Israel or invading it.

	Wd. sooner not have a mtg. in these inflamed circumstances.



A.E.	But see 2nd. para. of Art. 3 We can’t say nothing, at present time.

	Suggn. tht. we wdn’t stand by Treaty wd. encourage J. to rashness.



P.M.	Mght be politically necessary to take the worse military course of assistg. Jordanians in J.



R.A.B.	With inhibition v. using Air against Holy Places, this force wdn’t prevail.

	Look rather at re-inforcing Jordanians w’in Jordan.



Al.	C.O.S. don’t endorse final recommn. tht. this be disclosed to Jordan.



		Agreed :	C.O.S. to work out alternative plan not 				involving counter-attack v. Israel.

		CIGS.		Diffy. of that is tht. forces available in J. do not 			suffice for deterrent.  If we cd. raise squadron to 			regt. &amp; station it further north, it might suffice 			– tho’ we cdn’t do it quickly.  Mght discuss that 			with J. at f’coming mtg.

		F.O. to work this out, in consultn. with C.O.S.





		5.	Siam and Malaya.



A.E.	Only new point is para.6.



Sw.	Will tell P.M.’s of A. &amp; N.Z. tht. we are now spkg. to U.S.



						      [Exit Serv. Min &amp; C.O.S.

						       [Enter G.Ll. &amp; A.L.B.

		6.	Coal Prices.				



G.Ll.	Wd. not have bn. needed if we had succeeded in holding wages.

	2-2½% increase in productivity wd. have given them £9-10 m.

	But after rlway award increased yield fr. productivity was linked to the increased wages awarded to daily-paid rates.

	Other increased costs have therefore to be compensated, viz., capital investment charges amounting to £5 m.  Lower income fr. exports (£4 m).  Increase in piece-rates.

	Method.  Instead of flat-rate, propose to differentiate between qualities – increasg. costs of better qualities more than worse qualities.



R.A.B.	E.P.C. discussed &amp; concluded there was no alternative.  Tho’ it will lay heavy burden on rlways and on fishing.



A.E.	Great resentment among householders.



W.	May 3rd.– elections.



G.Ll.	i)  Altho’ price of h. coal will increase generally, in lower qualities there will be no increase &amp; some decrease.

	ii) May – to coincide with summer prices – wh. means tht almost all grades will not be reduced.



W.	Need we present this as increase balanced by summer reduction?

	

O.L.	Wdn’t you announce only the net prices in the last column.



G.Ll.	No : for you must forecast the normal (viz., winter prices.)

	You can stress, in presentn., the benefit of summer price.



F.H.	Which grades are recommended for new grates?



G.Ll.	Large house groups are 3, 4 &amp; 5.



J.S.	Must we wipe off deficit so quickly?  This plan wd. extinguish it by ’56.



G.Ll.	Existg. deficit of £13 M. will be increased by another £17 M. w’out this price increase.

	But there are bound to be increased costs next year because of charges on larger investment.



H.M.	Increased prices encourage miners to demand more wages.



 J.S. &amp; T.D.	Trawler-owners will demand increased subsidies.



G.Ll.	N.C.B. did well to get N.U.M. to link wage increase with productivity.

	Our labour problem is more dangerous than in other industries.

	We have done well on this.  Must keep their co.opn.



R.A.B.	We can’t allow this deficit to grow.  This and rlways both going deeper into red wd. shake confidence.

	N.C.B. members want to get on to an even keel.



W.M.	Can’t easily predict effect on workers.



RAB.	Our coal is cheaper than foreign.  We cd. get more if we exported.

	There will be day of reckoning if we p’pone.

	See consequences on Budget of our reluctance to reduce food subsidies.



P.T.	Heavy burden on industry of rising prices.

	But agree with R.A.B.  Will be worse if we duck it now.



G.Ll.	Heyworth &amp; Hambro’ might resign if this were refused.

	Their view is tht. priv. enterprise wd. have raised prices much higher much earlier.



Sw.	Support this.  But threaten N.U.M. later with oil.



G.Ll.	That is my long-term policy – to bring in more oil.  We shan’t get work from miners until country needs them less.

	N.U.M. campaign : N.C.B. selling coking coal to de-nationalised steel cos. at inadequate price, lower than export price.  If we don’t do this, there will be real trouble in Durham.



W.	Can we p’pone until after 15/5: e.g. until 1/6.



G.Ll.	They will ask about summer prices on 3/5 – the traditional date.



W.	Leave it until 1/7 – and defend.



		Proposal approved.
