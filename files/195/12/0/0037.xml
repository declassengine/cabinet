C. 48(54)								8th July, 1954



							[Enter 3 Serv. Min., C.O.S., B.H.

		1.	Aden.



Al.	Air action – more efficient, &amp; less loss of life, than use of ground troops.



O.L.		Agree we shd. have frontier consultn. – tho’ little will come of it.

		No action w’out consultn. with F.O.



P.M.	Drew attenn. to Tel. 26 fr. Q.E.  Advantages of warning before bombing.



C.I.G.S.	Support views of M/D.



A.E.		Agree with O.L.’s scepticism of consultn.

	But think we might be taken to U.N.  Don’t therefore like bombing – creates more public worry.  Wd. prefer strengthening ground troops, tho’ that is expensive.

	May I review this before I go to Geneva.



O.L.	Para. 7 covers that.  No action without A.E.’s consent.



Sw.	Dom. reaction wd. be serious.  Asiatics wd. not support.  N.Z. voted v. U.S. on Guatemala, &amp; cdn’t be expected to do more than abstain if it came to U.N.  Wd. wish to discuss with A.E. &amp; O.L. whether we shd. not consult old Doms. &amp; what we say to new.

		A.E. to consider.

		(	Negotiations to continue.

		(	Explanation to Doms. be prepared.



O.L.	M’while Salem is going to Yemen &amp; proposing to return via troubled part of Protectorate.  Govr. wants him excluded.

	x|	We cd. try to deter him fr. coming.  If he urges he shd. go, we cd. receive him at frontier and escort him to Aden, by air or jeep.



A.E.		Don’t mind your excluding him, if you prefer.



			Agreed : as at x/.

									[Exit 3 Serv. Min., C.O.S.

									[Enter D.S.

		2.	Atomic Weapons Programme.



P.M.		Invite L.P.S.  to express his view on moral issue.



H.C.		What financial commitment is involved?

		Is it sensible for U.K., alone in Europe, to do this when we know we shall not wage major war w’out U.S. as Ally.  Shd. we not leave U.S. &amp; R. as sole manufrs. : and preserve our right to say no European power shd. make it.



D.S.		Latter argument weakened by fact we are making the less efficient a. weapons.



Al.		Have we not a duty to our people to possess best weapons.



RAB.		On cost : cheaper per power developed than a. weapons.



D.S.		About 9/10ths. of effort is required for going on with a. weapons.

		Much flexibility retained as betwn H. &amp; A. bombs.  Can convert A. into H. bombs.



H.M.		Shock to be told, casually, tht. we were going to do this.  A no of us feel like that.



P.M.		Must take a decision in principle.  Not necessarily to-day.

		Doesn’t depend on technical detail.

		Mainly a moral ques.  cf. Soper’s statements as reported in Press to-day : D. Worker.

		I advise in favour of manufacture – but don’t minimise moral issue.



A.E.		Thought moral issue was decided by Labour Govt., when made a bomb.  No difference in principle.

		Possession of a. weapons is now measure of power &amp; influence in world.

		Believe tht. as its deterrent power is realised this may well make war less likely.



M.F.		Agree with A.E.

		i) 	Deterrent.  We must make our contn. to that.  More likely to prevent war than bring it on.

		ii)	Anxiety lest U.S. shd. start a war – out of China or to forestall.  Our best chance of restraining them is to retain their respect.  More likely to do so, if we play our part in deterrent influence.



Sim.		Morally, can’t distinguish betwn a. &amp; h. bombs.

		We are ready to accept protn. of U.S. possession of these bombs.

		If so, can’t be wrong to make them ourselves.



W.M.		Agree with Sim.



Sw.		Favour going fwd.  



R.A.B. J.S. Ll.G. agreed. 



O.L.		Agree.  Even in smaller wars, total reliance on U.S. won’t enable us to conduct independent f. policy.



F.H.		Agree with Sim.

		Was worried by spread of this into Europe, incldg. Germany.

		But don’t dissent from decision to make this.



H.C.		Wd. wish to reflect a little longer.



H.M.		So would I.



P.M.		Then we can bring it up in a week or so.



H.M.		Cd. we have some guidance on our public line.  We can’t hope to keep it secret for ever.



P.M.		Resume at convenient day before end of July.  Prelimy. work to go fwd. m’while.



F.H.		Abolition agreement – more easy if we were, or were not, making it.



A.E.		Probably easier if we did make it.





		3.	Washington Talks.  Meeting with Malenkov.



P.M.		Read Eisenhower’s message. This will be circulated in buff boxes.  Read draft answer to Eisenhower.  Propose to despatch this.  Shall not invite Cab. decn. until I have E.’s further reply.

		R. may suggest Moscow.  Disposed to decline that.

		I have exchanged many messages with President – in war and in present Govt.  I must ask for confidence of Ministers in this.  I have never sent messages to For. Secretary personages w’out consultn. with my For. Secretary.  Reserve my right to communicate personally with Heads of Govts – tho’ F. Secy. sees &amp; has right to suggest reference to Cabinet.

		Believe I can get better answer from E.



A.E.		Clear we shdn’t go to Moscow.  But Berne, at end of Geneva, wd. be a reasonable request.  Hope P.M. will add that to his draft.



Sal.		Cabinet members must know where they stand.

		Tho’ these were personal views, they constituted gt. act of f. policy.  Speech of 11/5 was personal, but bound Cab. unless they dissented.  As P.M. has constitutional right to take any decn.  But remedy of Ministers is to resign if they disagree.  That is not a comfortable posn.  If you reserve your absolute right to conduct such personal corres., we shall have to consider our position also.



P.M.		L.P.S. has expd. regret at my action in sending message to Mol.



H.C.		Such a big act of national policy tht. Cab. shd. have had chance of expressg. view before done.  Some commitmt. in making approach at all.

		If my view had bn sought, I wd. have bn reluctant to favour making such a move at this moment.

		The tel., tho’ personal, did involve our collective responsibility.



P.M.		I drew distinction btwn. enquiry &amp; action.  Action must receive Cab. assent.  Thght enquiry wd. be permissible – if made with concurrence of A.E.  He cd. have insisted tht. it shd. come to Cab.



A.E.		We had it in mind tht.  RAB. wd. bring it to Cabinet.



R.A.B.		Tel. reached me in Norfolk on Saty. marked Private &amp; Personal &amp; no circuln.  I gave some re-actions of my own : consultg. only F.O. official who had seen tel.  Before I cd. send my comments, another message arrived fr. P.M. askg. wtr original message had gone.

		Express my regret, if I misunderstood.

		Must keep this in perspective.  i) Was clear P.M. intended to consult Cabinet on return – was a refce. to Cabt. in first draft.  ii) F.O. officials confirmed tht. this was not much more than continn. of A.E.’s contacts with Molotov.

		I had no knowledge of what had passed in W’ton.



Sal.		Only 2 more days passed before P.M. returned.  What was urgency wh. precluded waiting for proper consultn.



P.M.		I may have exaggerated urgency of my hope for strengthening world peace.  Perhaps was impatient of delay when I was only makg. personal enquiry which wd. not commit Cabinet.

		Cannot accept censure for action taken in good faith in accordce. with principles followed in my experience of Cabinets.

		Wd. be unfortunate if Cabinet broke on such an issue – on which opinion wd. be divided in the country.

	x/	Cd. not abandon my freedom of confl. corrce. with Heads &amp; States. or to send such a message as this if shown to F. Secy. in advance.



Sw.		No-one challenges x/.  A P.M. has also duty not to commit Cab. w’out their approval.  Ques is wtr a particular message virtually commits Cab.  This may not have bn intended.  What is its effect?



P.M.		Cab. decn. wd. be needed before any action taken.



Sal.		Diffy. is this.  Sitn. is not same as before message sent.  Suppose Cab. decided or wished to decide it wd. be better not to go on.  If exchange leaked, impn. wd. be given tht. P.M. wished to do this &amp; had bn deterred by colleagues.  That sitn. need not have arisen.



J.S.		R. will leak if it suits them.  Hope tht. we will be kept in mind in drafting further messages.



P.M.		Have to live with risk of leakages – esp. in U.S.



J.S.		Cd. not our Amb. carry out some of these enquiries – in lieu of written communications – in case of Moscow?



O.L.		No one ques P.M.’s right of corrce.

		But Cab. responsibility can’t be engaged w’out their knowledge.

		Have we become engaged?  Much more diff. for us to dissent.

		But it does remain open for us, tho’ more difficult, to w’draw.



R.A.B.		P.M.’s priceless power in such mtgs.  A.E.’s contacts.

		Leave major ques of action to another Cabinet.



P.M.		Will bring it fwd. when E.’s reply is received.

		I may myself be convinced it’s better not to go forward.  But if I found myself at variance with colleagues, I cd. resign.  Hope we may arrive at agreed conclun.  No need to give M. detailed reasons for not going fwd.  Cd. thank him, but say no further actn. for moment.



A.E.		Berne is more than difference of place.  It wd. put difft. complexion on whole thing.  If they won’t come, we have at least tried.



										[Exit Sw.

		4.	Parliament.



H.C.		i)	Oppn. want F.A. debate on Wedy.



A.E.		I must go to Geneva on Mon., at latest.



H.C.		Oppn. may then change their minds.  I won’t announce subject for Wedy.

		ii)	Date for Crichel Down debate.  Must give a firm date.  Suggest week after next.



P.M.		If a F.A. debate, wd. sooner not make statement on Mon.  Wd. make it as speech at opening of debate.



H.C.		iii)	Food &amp; Drugs Bill.  Shall say we hope to get 2nd. Rdg. before recess.



	 							        [Enter A.L.B 

		5.	Re-organisation of Railways.



H.C.		No chance of a day – unless we sit into Aug.

		Suggest W. Paper be published – to force Oppn. to give a day if they want it discussed.

		They have naturally refused to give a day for Crichel.



B.H.		They might, if pay goes well, be more accommodating.



A.L.B.		Major Govt. policy.  Don’t like sitting on it thro’ summer.

On balance therefore I wd. prefer to publish &amp; take a chance on criticism.



			Agreed : Present Wh. Paper.





		6.	Parliament : Members’ Expenses.



R.A.B.		Oppn. accept our plan, tho’ with gt. disappointment.

		We shd therefore announce w’out delay.

		Only change involved is retrospection.  Revised draft handed in.

		No resoln. needed.  Only Suppl. Estimate.

			Agreed : P.M. to announce.

		Do we make it retrospective to 24/5.



B.H.		Party won’t like that.



Sal.		1st June wd. be more sensible.  



H.C. 		15/6 after Whitsun recess.



R.A.B.		Doesn’t apply to Ministers.  Will make that clear in reply to supplementaries.





		7.	Coal Imports.



R.A.B.		Reserve policy.  But must buy the imports.  U.S. coal fr. Eur. for sterling.
