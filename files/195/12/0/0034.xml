C. 45(54)							1st July, 1954



		1.	East/West Trade.	[Enter AH., de L., 3 Ch. of Staff. S.Ll.



P.T.	P.M. thinks I shd. go to W’ton this w/end to see Stassen.

	I wd. prefer to wait one week &amp; consult AE m’while.

	Official talks going well until 2 wks ago, when U.S. ceased to co-operate because of I/China.

	Mtg. on 8/7. Agree we shd. p’pone that until 19/7.

	U.S. refusing to agree to opn. up decns. because of I/China.

	Want to get P.M.’s view before I spk. to Stassen.  Don’t want to disturb atmosphere of agreemt. wh. P.M. has created.

	Read draft telegram.



S.Ll.	Support this view – and draft.



R.A.B.	Stiffen it up against going.  				W’ton Tel. 1344.



Sw.	If P.T. goes to W’ton, U.K. assume whole onus of disagreemt. with U.S.

	Other countries support our view.



P.T.	We have run this on U.K./U.S. line.

	Wd. prefer to leave decision to those on the spot.



		Telegram approved.





		2.	Aden.



O.L.	As in memo.  Seek authy. to bomb these villages, after warning.

	

Al.	Support this.  To avoid demand for ground troops and a lasting military commitment.  Not new : was done on N.W.F. of India before war.  Can be v. effective.



Sw.	Worked well when I was in C.O.

	Hard on our tribesmen, who have accepted this discipline, if it can’t be applied to people who are attacking them.



de L.	i)  There is difference in bombing beyond border.

	ii) Avoid fresh commitment.



C.A.S.	In our villages, we can fine headman &amp; use bombing only if he disobeys orders.

	Different across border.  Not enforcing our discipline.  Yemen is member of U.N.



S.Ll.	Bound to be brght to Security Council.  If we do it in self-defence we shd. report to Council.  If we don’t, Arab States will bring us to Council.  In this area frontier is clear.

	Safer way would be to send a ground force – native levies.



O.L.	Will take some time to build it up.  Means increase of Aden levies.

	Let us report to U.N.  But do it.



de L.	Even native levies have to be officered &amp; paid by U.K.  It will be an added mil. commitment.  And they won’t stop this kind of raiding.



S.Ll.	Have asked Yemen Minister to ask his Govt. how they propose to stop this.

	He has promised reply by end/week.  Wait for that.



R.A.B.	P.M. must be told – e.g. effect on def. negotns. with E.



Sal.	Awkward if U.N. intervened &amp; sent peace observn. commn.



C.A.S.	Cd. we eliminate the barracks in hot pursuit after next raid.



H.M.	Cdn’t combine that with doctrine of “hot pursuit”.



O.L.    x|	Suggest we publish repns. made to Yemen Govt. – to warn public what may be coming along.		[Agreed.]



S.Ll.	Must build up a series of warnings.

	Apart fr. Egypt, there is also risk of breaking rapprochemt. with Saudis.



O.L.	Yemen &amp; Saudis aren’t good friends.  



S.H.  	But mght unite v. us.



		Agreed		i)   F.O. to inform P.M. of situation : also x/ :

				     Warning is 1st. stage. (not in para. 8 terms).

				ii)  F.O. to review U.N. aspects of this matter.

				iii) M’while, public warning in general terms 			      and more publicity for what is happening.



de L.	Para. 5.  Don’t commit myself to carry cost on Air Miny. Votes.



RAB.	Support plan for strengthening levies – cost £¼M.



							[Exit C.O.S., A.H.

	3.	Cocos Islands.					[Enter J.T.  Att. G.



Sw.	As in memo.



O.L.	Support.  Austr. may dislike our publishing their assurances.  Will they object?



Sw.	Haven’t put it to them.



L.P.S.	No legve. time, even next Session.  Must we do it?



Sw.	Yes : to keep faith with Austr.



Att.G.	App. D.  Recital of Austr. request – is indispensable.  Hope Austr. Govt. will agree.  



Sw. 	Will put this to Austr. Govt.



J.T/de L.	Admy. and Air Miny. shd. be kept in touch with Bill because of W/T. station &amp; air-strip.



		Approved – subject to Legve. P’mme.

	

							[Exit J.T., Att.G.

		4.	Re-organisation of Railways.		[Enter A.L.B., Home.



H.C.	No time before recess.

	Publish W. Paper.  x/ If Labour want to discuss they can give Supply Day. x/  We have no day to offer – even for F. Affairs or Crichel.

	Can’t scrap T. &amp; C. Bill or Lds. Amts. on Television or Reuters Bill.

	Can’t plan now on basis of sitting into August.

	x/ is fair bet.



A.L.B.	Don’t want this criticised throughout Recess.  Cd. we ascertain x/ before we publish?



H.C.	May have to make deals with Labour on 2 days.	[Enter Ch. Whip

	already (F.A. &amp;Crichel).  Cd. we ask for a 3rd.?



B.H.	We could try.



A.L.B.	Disastrous to disturb harmony of rlway world on this.



Sal.	H/L. is in diffies. because of H/C. delays on big Bills.  We are having to rush things.  May have to ask H/L. to sit on after H/C. has risen.



B.H.	Can’t be specific with Opposn. – unless they know already that White Paper is ready.



		Agreed : Chief Whip to enquire.

							[Exit A.L.B. &amp; Home

		



		5.	Members’ Expenses.



R.A.B.	Read CRA’s letter.

	Suggest H.C., with me and BH., shd. see him.  Avoid putting detailed plan, in light of his lr.  Invite his views. Give only general indicn. tht. we are movg. twds our scheme.  Be firm tht. we can give no date or commitmt. re giving effect to H/C. vote.



H.C.	On last point – opinion of H/C. is on record.  Not for us to re-affirm it.



RAB.	We can accept that this is opinion of H/C.



B.H.	Suggest you defer seeing them until after their Party mtg. this p.m.  They may be beginning to realise their general tactics aren’t wise.  C.R.A. may get wider discretion.

	Offer now to see him after dinner.			[Exit Simonds.





		6.	Crichel Down.



R.A.B.	Minister said, with Cab. approval, tht. “no further action” wd. be taken in reln. to officials.

	Public &amp; H/C. opinion is strongly in favour of transfer.

	C. Service opinion considers no transfers shd. be made in response solely to public pressure.



	Propose therefore Cttee. of 3 to consider wtr transfers are requd. to m’tain public confidence – on basis tht. disciplinary action has bn. disposed of.  T. Barnes : J.H.E. Woods : Pilkington.  Private enquiry : report before debate.

	Wish to inform P.M. – but to go ahead at once.



O.L.	Kipping vice  Pilkington.



P.T.	He is another “official”.  



Agreed : stet Pilkington.



T.D.	Cd. Cttee. also consider wtr Sanctuary &amp; Sons shd. continue to be employed.



Sw.	Enough in Clark’s report to warrant employing a difft. firm.



T.D.	Eastwood supports him &amp; says Clark was wrong e.g. on dilapidations.



		Agreed :	Exclude Sanctuary ques from enquiry.

				M/Ag. to make up his own mind.

				P.M. to be informed.





		7.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Hope Rpt. Stage of Finance Bill can be concluded in half a day.  So that we can get to Rents Bill in reasonable time e.g. 8 pm.



R.A.B.	Can’t promise.  H.G. has not committed himself – can’t until he sees marshalled amendmts on Monday.



B.H.	On any other day, Rents wd. have to come on after 10 p.m.



H.C.	8 days in Cttee. vice ormal 6.  Surely 1½ days on Rpt. shd. be enough.



H.M.	Cd. run until 9 p.m. – that wd. leave me enough time.

							             [Exit W., BH.



		8.	Council of Europe.



S.H.	As in brief.



O.L.	C.O. and CRO wd. prefer not to agree to Ch. III.  Don’t object to these tactics, so long as it is clear that we shan’t accept it.



S.H.	We have enough objns. to ensure that it can’t be carried.
