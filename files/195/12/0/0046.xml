C. 64(54)							12th October, 1954



		1.	Germany.



A.E.	Fr.Parlt. likely to support M. France’s submission.

	Next week we meet in Paris to conclude.  Must resist Fr. pressure for addl. condns.

	All other countries will ratify.





		2.	Formosa.



A.E.	Alternatives : attack on Quemoy – wh., if U.S. supported Chiang. wd. mean Sino-Am. war.

	Read text of draft telegram to Pekin.

	Similar tel. to be sent to Moscow, urging them to persuade Chinese to come to discn. in U.N.  (U.S. have come a long way in agreeing to accept them in discussion).

	Dangerous operation, but no option but to try it.



P.M.	U.S. are justified in protecting Formosa fr. Comm. attack; but then they must control Chiang (i.e. prevent him attacking Chinese mainland).



A.E.	Risk is that U.S. may be swept by their China lobby into a less reasonable attitude.



R.A.B.	Doubt wtr Chinese will come to U.N., w’out being accepted as a Member.



			Memo. approved.

							[Enter J. B-C.



		3.	Industrial Disputes.



		a)	Newspapers.



H.M.	Demarcation dispute betwn. 2 Unions.  All pp. affected because N.P.A. rule that all stop if one does.

	Dispute grumbling on for 12 mos.  Ct. of enquiry : conciliation but M/L : T.U.C. made a ruling for sharing the work.

	D’lock arose over w’end because of failure to settle minor diffce. over duties of 3 men during short absence.  I tried conciliation on Sunday pm. but they wdn’t consider any solution.  Told T.U.C. they must get Unions together.  After a day, they agreed to carry on.  Not permanent cure – may break out again.



	





		b)	London Buses.

	

	97 depots operating ban on over-time.  Unions ready to negotiate if this unofficial ban is lifted.  Men won’t lift it.  Discomfort to public – may mobilise public opinion.

	Emergency schedules on 9 routes from Wedy.  Dalston won’t accept these : but doubt if stoppage wd. spread.



		c)	Ship-repairing.



		Conference decided to recommend strike be made official, as A.E.U. 		have already done.  Argument is over redundancy rules (order of 			dismissal).  Unions are discussing with strikers.  Employers stick to		absolute discretion.

		Nothg. to be gained by my intervention.  Not v. serious. 



		d)	Docks.



	Saw Deakin this a.m.  Lightermen likely to come out to-night.  If so, will be in diffies. over fuel for power stations.  May have to use troops &amp; divert ships to other ports.  Govt. cd. not then hold aloof.  D. said action before mtg. of strikers to-morrow wd. be disastrous.  He will try to re-assert authy. of his Union.

	I promised to wait until Thurs. a.m., when he will see me again.

	Excuse for stoppage was meat-sorting dispute.  But real crux is wtr over-time shd. be voluntary or not.  I can’t conciliate on that; for it’s clear that stevedores won’t accept anything but purely voluntary over-time.  This wd. give them a whip-hand, &amp; create black market in overtime.  Moreover, 2 Unions won’t meet because one is poaching on other (T&amp;GW.).

	Alternative = ct. of enquiry.  D. reluctantly agreed this mght be necessary.  Wanted distinguished membership – also reluctant to let it go into working of Ldn. Dock Scheme.

	D.’s anxiety was to make it clear this was attempt by Left wing to capture his Union.  “If you try to buy time, you’ll buy a short amount for a large sum.”  Williamson agreed we shd. fight this.

	I advise waiting until Thurs., but not to put out of a/c possibility of ct. of enquiry.



P.M.	Right to be patient : but M/L. will have to say somethg. when Parlt. meets.



W.M.	Can’t do nothing (for conciliation) &amp; then use troops.



P.M.	Don’t use troops to preserve order, until Police can’t handle it.



W.M.	Only meant using them to m’tain supplies.



J.B.C.	About one week &amp; then diffies. will begin – over power stations &amp; removal of refuse.



Alex.	Want 72 hrs’ notice for use of troops.



A.E.	Buses.  V. unpopular.  Some criticism of Govt. inaction.



J.B.C.	Yes.  



*A.E. 	 Some explanation cd. with advantage be given.  M/L. &amp; M/T to consider jointly. *    Agreed.



P.M.	Prepare (but don’t announce) plans to use troops to m’tain services.
