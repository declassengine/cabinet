C. 72(54)							29th October, 1954



		1.	Dock Strike.					[Enter J.B-C.



W.M.	Agreement rejected because employers wdn’t agree to make it natl. settlement.

	Diffy : employers wd. be commd. to negotns. outside normal machinery.  Striking Unions had no members outside Ldn., tho’ during strike have secured minority of members in Hull &amp; ? Manchr.

	But there are diffies. w’in strikers’ Cttee.  Some are in touch with Deakin.

	I therefore advise waiting until Mon.  Intervene then (troops) if men aren’t coming back.  Premature action will spread strike.



P.M.	Don’t dissent – tho’ considered tht. Cab. shd. review position.

	Wd. play into Barrett’s hands if, by premature action, we now precipitated a general strike.



W.M.	No ques. of giving way on the “national” issue.

	Action Monday means announcemt on Monday that troops will be used &amp; they wd. then come in on Wedy.



A.E.	Fear tht. this will be setback for Deakin &amp; moderate element in T.U. movement.  Victory for Barrett wd. be victory for Bevanites.

			Cabinet to meet 12.30 p.m. Monday to take decision re

			troops, if the strike still continues.



W.M.	If there we a natl. negotn. on overtime, it wd. be betwn. Deakin &amp; Natl. Employers.  Stevedores, Union are not repd. on Natl. negotiating machinery.



A.E.	Wd. look as tho’ Barrett had succeeded in his aim, even if he were not in the negotns.



H.M.	Begin to move troops on Monday, but don’t announce until they can arrive hard on heels of announcemt.





		2.	Canada : Hurricane.



Sw.	Can. Govt. have welcomed offer of £25.000, to be presented by Qn. Elizabeth.



	H.M. is on tour : will have to be put to her.



P.M.	Not v. desirable.  Looks as tho’ Queen had faltered &amp; Q.E. was puttg. it straight.



Sal.	I agree.



A.E.	Announce at once.  Keep Q. Eliz. out of it.

		Agreed : Offer £25,000 : Govt. to Govt.
