C. 56(54)							29th July, 1954



		1.	Egypt.						[Enter de L., B.H.



B.H.	No amendment tabled.  Will be easier w’out one.



Sal.	Posn. in H/L.  Hankey asked me for chance to make his posn. clear.

	I tabled amendmt. to give him chance.  He then protested against being offered it. : so I w’drew it.  No ques. of my w’drawg. from a Govt. position : was only trying to help him.



							[Exit B.H.

		2.	Malta.



O.L.	No formal reply fr. Malta on H.O. offer.  Deadlock must be broken.

	Alternatives : i) mtg. incldg. both pol. Parties in Malta. Of the two this is preferable : for a Minister cd. guide the conference.

		         ii) R. commn.  May be forced on us.  But shd. not be promised w’out further reference to Cab.  For it mght commit us to policies we disliked – or force us to repudiate its findings.

	Tho’ not made clear in memo, I greatly prefer (i).

	Suggest authy. to explore that &amp; m’while make no refce. to R. Commn.

	Not sure tht. long-term financial settlement is possible : but can see a provisional settlement w’in the total of what we shd. have to provide anyway.



Sw.	Strongly opposed to R. Commn.  Must keep discn. w’in control of Ministers.

	In last resort it is not impossible to say “No.”

	No truck with transfer to C.R.O.

							[Enter Att.G,.



		3.	Tarrant Rushton.



de L.	This was recognised as airfield in commercial use by County Dev. Plan – since 1952.



M.F.	Cttee. conclude tht. Cobham shd. remain, with suitable lease.

	Further enquiry.  H.M. can’t reopen Plan enquiry.  Under s. 26 of T.C.P. Act, enquiry wd. involve Minister taking a view against this use.  Under W. Paper procedure enquiry wd. not be suitable.

	Proposed use was known when Co. Plan was adopted.

	There is an important defence purpose.

	Enquiry wd. show similar sitn. at 3 other airfields.

	Defence purposes &amp; Cobham’s work are important enough to warrant us in giving lease, with restrictions, to Cobham.



Sal.	Don’t dissent from concln. reached.

	But more to be said on Marten’s side.  Wages are higher than locally &amp; labour will be w’drawn fr. farms.  Nature of locality will be affected.

	Proposed use was not realised when Co. Plan was approved.



de L.	Cobham has bn. there since 1947.  That was known when Plan made.

	Labour : only 15 fr. agric. : rest from neighbouring towns.



P.T.	Shd. be enquiry.  Marten didn’t know he cd. object at time of Plan.



H.M.	There will be a row.  Ques : how best to handle it.

	New fact tht. some aircraft work must be done at airfields – involves industrial developmt. in country districts.

	Weakness of our posn. – i) marked on Co. Plan as “civilian airfield”.

	In fact, only mil. types go there.  ii) used for “commercial” purposes – wh. implies civil aviation traffic, but in fact is industrial.



de L.	Work done = re-fuelling : modificns. to proto-types : repairs to  Meteors : engine overhauls (by road).

	Defence purposes : v. good airfield certainly needed in war.



H.M.	Other weakness iii) some of his work cd. be done in a town.

	After enquiry, v. likely a M/Housing wd. record decision recommended by Cttee.

	Shd. be criticised prs. on basis tht. enquiry was a waste – as on Gatwick.

	Also may be awkward evidence re C.’s tenure under requisitioning.

	My concln. : on whole, we shall have less trouble without enquiry.

	Co. Planning Cttee. wd. probly. be content if some of C.’s activities were discontinued and a tight lease were granted.



de L.	Farmers’ Union have asked for enquiry under W. Paper.	[Enter A.E.

	But I think I can satisfy them w’out enquiry.



P.M.	Let attempt be first made to secure agreemt. with local authorities.  Don’t pursue idea of enquiry until that possibility is exhausted.



H.M.	Aim at agreemt. with all interests save Marten.

	Report back to Cab. on extent of agreemt. wh. can be reached.





		4.	Capital Punishment.



M.F.	R. Commn. made 3 major recommns. (age : discretion to jury to recommend reprieve : M’Naghten rules) with all of which I disagree.

	Some minor recommns. cd. be effected administratively.  Those that need legn. must be left over.

	Give it a run in a day’s debate next Session.

	But real issue is : do we retain cap. punishment or abolish it.  I favour retention.

Sim.	I agree on all points.   



W.M. 	So do I.



Att.G.	Para 14.  I wd. put it more strongly.



M.F.	Quite ready to give my views at outset of debate – wh. wd. be equivalent to rejecting the recommns.



P.M.	Then let us announce tht. we reject the report.

							  [Exit Att.G.

							  [Enter J.T., Birch.



		5.	Antarctica.



A.E.	Not keen on this.  Best way to demonstrate our control over these areas.  Commonw. wd. probably like it.



O.L.	Aerial survey is prs. most important – tho’ expensive.

	Tho’ sceptical about minerals because of cost of winning them, we 

               x|	ought to know what there is before we relinquish our claims.

	Choice is betwn. giving up our claim or re-asserting it.



R.A.B.	E.P.C. mtgs. on b/payments.  Overseas exp’re has risen by 45% in last 12 mos.  or more.  Will circulate a memo.  Egypt decn. will help : but posn. is worrying.

	Wd. accept at once new supply-ship.  But not keen on air survey.



O.L.	Case for latter is x/.  Can see by this where mineralisation [has taken place] is possible.  I agree we shdn’t spend this money on mapping.

	Shd. be sure tht. informn. will be obtd. on minerals : ready to verify this.



Sw.	Journey.  A, N.Z. &amp; S.Afr. are all interested &amp; mght put up some cash.

	RGS might also raise some.



J.T.	Balance will fall on Admy. and Air Miny. : shd. like to see what cost will be.



O.L.	This shd. be subject to working out the cost in detail.



Sal.	Th. nuclear tests.  This might be only area available to us.



Sw.	Intern. Court.  We shd. need to consult Doms. on this first.

	(para. 14(3).)  Agreed : consult them at once.



								[Exit Birch.

		6.	Gibraltar : Pay of Industrial Workers.



W.M.	Recalled earlier discn.  Met Ministers.  All agreed no further enquiry necessary.  Materials for decision are available.

	Decision needed : shd Spaniards in Gib. be paid same rate for same job.  C/l. allowance has become part of wage – it is more than 50% for Gibraltarians.

	Discrimination will be based on nationality as well as domicile.

	But proposals in Ty. memo. wd. reduce that discrimination.



P.M.	Has declined to lower level of importance now it isn’t viewed in light of Queen’s visit.

	No need for Spaniards to come in to Gib. to work if they don’t wish.

	Shd. we pay them higher rates than they wd. get in Spain.

	Can’t we now leave this alone – at least for some months.

	Quite a lot of other things in the world wh. aren’t fair.



O.L.	Ty. always prefer to wait until there is a row &amp; then spend more.



J.T.	My informn. is tht. there’s no gt. demand for this.

	If the Span. pay is raised, Gib. will want more – to preserve the differential.



A.E.	Differential gives Franco a propaganda point.



R.A.B.	Spanish behaviour is not above reproach.

	Why not reduce differential by 10/=?



W.M.	Move in right direction.



A.E.	Don’t accept final sentence of C. 259.



W.	Wiser to move wages up by stages.



		Agreed :  Ask Govr. wtr 10/= will do., pro. tem.



							[Exit de L., J.T.

		7.	Germany : Abolition of Visas.



M.F.	Drew attention to Security Service review.  Tantamount to abolishing visas for E. Germans.  Thought Cab. shd. be aware if this.

	But accept importance of f. policy consns.  Ready to accept A.E.’s view.

	Ready therefore to abolish visas coming for less than 3 months.



A.E.	We &amp; Portugal are alone in m’taining this discrimination.



M.F.	There is a risk, but I admit tht. pol. consns. outweight it.



P.M.	Cd. ask W. Germans to tighten up their control betw. E &amp; W.

	Germany.



		Agreed – subject to informing Cab. of nos who are now 			   coming, as visitors.







		8.	Persia : Loan.



A.E.	Shd. we give short-term loan, after oil agreemt. is settled.

	It wd. be credit fr. E.C.G.D. – about £5M. : to be fitted in with U.S. plans. Comparable to Yugoslav loan.  Wd. have to be spent on Br. goods – a way of getting back into that market.



	Timing – shd. be left to me &amp; R.A.B.

	Reserve right to offer it, even tho’ U.S. don’t come along.



R.A.B.	Agree.



				Approved.
