C. 18(54)								15th March, 1954



		1.	Egypt.	           [Enter 3 Serv. Min. 2 C.O.S., ALB., BH, S.Ll.

	

A.E.	E. now ready to offer better availability clause.  Risk tht. we may be forced into brkg. over uniform. – not an easily defensible posn.

	Not keen on small &amp; dwindling no. of troops i/c. Base.

	Therefore consider possibility of removg. troops &amp; putting Base under civilian control &amp; m’tenance.

	Para. 11.  Steps to restore confidence includes points in para. 6.  That wd. be the stick.  Amb. wd. show carrot – viz., nature of agreemt. we wd. make if E. Govt. had taken those steps.



Sal.	Disliked this at 1st. sight.  But fr. realistic view, it facilitates re-deploymnt., gives re-entry on satisf. terms, gives us 20 yrs. vice

	Argument against : involves complete evacuation &amp; that is anathema to our dissidents.  Can we get away with it with them?  If not, we shd. have to abandon it.



Al.	From mil. angle this has advantages.  Tho’ we shd. have to be sure we cd. get suitable contractors to take it on; &amp; we shd. have to retain right to send in mil. insprs. (in plain clothes).



RAB.	Seeking solution in E. because impending overseas exp’re on G.

	Two anxieties	i)	how will civil contractor basis work?

		how far wd. E. Govt. have to be parties to contract?

		how protect contractors fr. unreasonable E. action?



	ii)	A.E. says “troops shd. re-deploy elsewhere”. We need strong alternative location.  Can’t rely on N. being supported by p. opinion.  We must be able to re-intervene if there’s trouble.  On Suez we need more than article in agreemt.  Wd. wish U.S. to come in &amp; support freedom of Canal.  Can’t hope to convince our supporters unless we have both points in (ii).



H.C. 	If we go for this sort of solution, we had better present it on basis that our real concern is Canal.



Sw.	This plan wd. probably be acceptable to Comm.

	The technicians were always weak part of our original plan.  Hostages to fortune.  Wd. be possible to defend in Parlt. giving up this part of our original plan.

	Canal.  Assurance shd. be, not to us only, but to all countries with this maritime interest.



M.F.	Cd. be presented to H/C. if we firmly represent it as giving time for a redeployment on our initiative.  Main cause of discontent is feeling tht. we are being thrown out at E. initiative.

	We know we must redeploy in the end.

	Canal.  Recital in preamble is binding on party wh. makes it.  Also has current publicity value.



H.M.	Is this a good plan on merits?  If so, we can carry Party.

	Advantages :	i)	get rid of technicians – which were never going to 

			be fighters.

		ii)	gives us time.  In 7 yrs. world crisis may not be 

			over.  Twenty years is v. much better, if we can get

			it.

		iii)	we need re-deploymt. which preserves both our 

			prestige and our power in M/E.

	Continue study.  Go ahead, if satisfied it’s a good plan.



W.M.	Needs more study.

	Restoring confidence.  Shall need time to see wtr we shd. be justified in placing that confidence on E. assurances.

	Technicians.  A weakness.  But at least deterred interference, because wd. have bn. an act of war.



J.S.	What of posn. of Br. civilian employees – unguarded by troops?  H/C. won’t like that.

	Also what assurance tht. Base will be in good shape when we re-enter.



Sim.	Doubt first point.  New atmosphere, in wh. E. wd. be much less likely to interfere.



W.	No one wd. have faith in word of E. Govt.

	H/C. will wwant to know tht. we shall still have posn. of strength of M/E.  



A.H.	Armd. brigade in Libya.  2 Brigades in Cyprus.

	First cd. move in across desert.  Second thro’ Tobruk.



Al.	Tho’ they wd. have to be re-inforced, from UK, if we had to go back against hostile Egypt.



Sw.	You cdn’t go back, by force, into E. merely because E. weren’t m’taing Base.



A.E.	No.  Only if availability clause because operative.  Then we cd return wtr E. were willing or not.



R.A.B.	Canal?



A.L.B.	Wylie thinks E. will not harm installations, unless we guard them with Br. troops.  Tho’ they may impede our shipping.

	Want clause in Agreemt. re Canal vice incln. in preamble.  That will help with H/C.



P.M.	V. gt. anxiety.

	On merits.  Depends wholly on confidence.  I feel none in an agreemt. wh. has no physical force to ensure respect for it.

	Suggd. we seek guarantees re fair treatment in Sudan i.e. fair E. conduct.  But we had those in the Anglo-S. Agreemt.  All N. is asked to say is : I won’t break my word again.

	N.’s posn. is difficult.  He has recovered his posn. in E. mainly because of his Sudanese descent.  This (E. control over S.) is real E. object.  His posn. depends on driving us out &amp; re-establishing E. posn. in S.  How does this co-incide  with our interests?  N. needs quarrel with us even more than triumph.  I can’t trust his word, even if he gave us assurances – unless there were some other guarantee.

	Acceptance of N.’s word wd. be regarded as a rebuff to us.

	W’drawal of plan for 4.000 technicians I never liked.  But uniform meant status &amp; that meant interference was act of war.  To w’draw this wd. certainly appear to be submn. on our part.  We get nothing in return save N.’s word.

	Wd. have bn. readier to accept civilian control of Base if there had bn. other guarantees.  But we cdn’t come back by force merely becaus E. let Base go.

	Will N. carry this with his people?  Even if he gives assurances re S., he will surely go back on it.  Dearest dream of E. hearts is to recover lost hold over Sudan.

	Joint Anglo-U.S. approach might have give some assurances for future.  Many political criticisms cd. be levelled v. this plan.  Thus – convenient is disembarrass ourselves of E. and S.  But civil war will follow in S. : we cd. not disinterest ourselves w’out repudn. of our responsibilities.  Nor therefore only a blow to Br. prestige, but may lead on to bloody consequences.

	Like suggested emphasis on Canal.  Don’t value Base – which doesn’t pay us.

	This policy wd. be regarded as complete surrender.

	What wd. be time-table?  I want to get some troops out of E. at once.

	Believe first armd. divn. cd. leave now, esp. if we accompanied it by firm statement of our future intentions.

	I care far move about Sudan (a great &amp; living trust) than about Canal Zone.

	Sympathy with A.E.  Must help him.



A.E.	i)	Re-deploymt.  Cd. include brigade in Jordan, if we needed it.

	ii)	Canal.  Was included in preamble because this is decln. of E.’s intention &amp; there is no bi-lateral agreement betw. us &amp; E. on Canal.  Others are concerned.  Ready to consider strengthening wording.

	iii)	Status.  Diff. to judge wtr this is better or worse than earlier plan.  We shd. have right to go back by force under availability clause, even if E. renounced agreement.

	At present we have complete jurisdn. over our troops.  We cd. demand this for technicians, under agreement – and drop uniform clause.

	iv)	N. may be ambitious to recover Sudan.  But they must see that feeling there is mounting against them.  They surely don’t want a civil war in S. – with all it mean for their water.



H.M.	Are we going to negotiate further with E. on either plan until we have had a period in wh. to get more confidence in N.  Two points : (i) to consider what is best plan, old or new or mixture.  (ii) timing &amp; confidece. needed for either.

	Suppose N. accepted our offer as it now stands.  What wd. we say?  Are we to say, whatever he offers w’out guarantees, tht. in view of what has happened in Sudan we haven’t enough confidence to make any agreemt.



P.M.	i)	Call off current negotns.

	ii)	Announce intentn. to redeploy.  Begin at once to send armd. brigade to Libya.  And put one brigade group at or nr.  Khartoum.  As guarantee of Sudan’s independence of E. interference 

	In E. (Canal Zone) we re-group for better safety.*

	Aim at multi-lateral assurance of security of Canal.

	Action not words would be offered for debate.

	These suggns. are thrown out merely for examination.

		*abandoning Rodeo but holding e.g. Suez.

	You will get nothing out of E. except by show of force.



A.E.	How wd. Sudanese re-act to arrival of Br. troops.  They wd. ask purpose.



P.M.	To present further E. interference with S. movement to independence. As a sanction.

	Agree you must watch timing.  But nearly had a chance last week.



A.E.	How break of def. negotns?  What pretext, now they have offered one concession.



P.M.	That their internal instability makes it not worth while.



A.E.	Final warning.  N. may say one day we agree on all save uniform.  Then what support shall we have for our intransigeance?



Sal.	Cd. we consider more precise scheme of redeploymt. – as counter-attraction to our supporters.



Al.	We wd. be stronger in M/E under our redeploymt. plan than as now.



H.M.	Cd. we say we cd. only initial agreemt. with Govt. wh. has no Parly. or democratic support.  Must await that before we confirm it – viz., ratification by a Parlt.



P.M.	Will discuss with A.E. and others arrangements for small Cttee. to review it all.



R.A.B.	Our troops remaining – or genuine U.S. co-opn. in M/E. defence – these are only solutions wh. our Party wd. accept.  Is there no hope of the second?



A.E.	Tried – always w’out success.



H.M.	Anglo-U.S. civil company to m’tain Base?



P.M.	We shall continue to have friction with E because we shall not abandon Sudan.  And N.’s Govt. will live on that friction.



A.E.	Cd. we say prs. to U.S. – we have no confidence in E., as events in S. have shown.  We can’t therefore conclude agreemt. previously contemplated.  But will you come in &amp; join with us in m’taining Base thro’ a civilian organisation.

	May I consider this?  Cd. go ahead with that, with P.M.’s consent, if I see my way to frame an appeal to them.  

Redeployed, we shd. be equally able to fly re-inforcemts to Sudan.





	2.	Sudan.



S.Ll.	We have possibility there.  E. has overplayed her hand.  We must continue to press our demands.  If they aren’t meet, we may well have to declare emergency &amp; resume power.  We shd therefore make plans now – what shd. we do then.

	To play hand properly much depends on Howe, &amp; he isn’t in touch with Sudanese.  Can’t change him.

	Morale of B. officials is v. low.  They want a date for end of contracts compensn. &amp; pensions.  This was done in India.  After 1/3, we can’t preserve Ty. posn. tht. this must wait upon negotns. with S. Govt.  Will RAB now declare scheme is fair &amp; HMG. will make interim payments under it pending negotn. with S. Govt.



P.M.	RAB must have time to consider this.



Al.	Has C-in-C. M/E. still authority to send re-inforcemts to Sudan at request of Govr-Genl.



P.M.	Yes.

					[Exit Serv. Min. COS., ALB. H.M. 





	3.	Remuneration of M.P.’s.



P.M.	Tactics.  We shd. play for time.  Let Opposn. make the case – and take their share of the responsibility.



	Favour telling them we can announce nothg. at present.

	Consol.  Fund Bill?

B.H.	Comes on next week.  Too soon for P.M.’s attitude.

	They cd. stage debate on a [any] Supply Day, however.



P.M.	Wd. prefer to avoid serious discussion until after Budget.

	P’pone our decision until we have heard a debate – w’out a divn.



B.H.	Wait for them to suggest a motion : then tell them that wd. wreck all their hopes.  Then work for debate w’out division.



P.M.	M’while consider merits.

	Looks as tho’ opinion is hardening v. it in the country.

	General support for – “lodging turns”.

				free postage &amp; telephones from W’minster.

	No support for pool of typists.





	4.	Farm Price Review.



T.D.	Can get redn. of ……

	Direct Exch. saving of £23¾M. in 1954.

	Short of £2 to £4M. on milk, as cpd. with RAB’s wish.

	If we try to screw more out of them, they will run out.

	Marketing company will save more.  Cd. be represented as £55M. redn. in farmers’ incomes.



R.A.B.	Will be no loss to farmers.  Feed down by 2d. &amp; we seek only 1d. reduction.  Milk for manuf.g. will rise – &amp; we can’t dispose of what we get now.  Want still more off milk price – or we shall have to pour it down the drain.

	Eggs – scandal rivalling groundnuts – cost over £30M.  And yet no great change.  4/3 to 4/0.

	Get those down to 3/11., at least.

	Pigs.  Settling at 3/= redn., when we annc’d. at 4/3d.

	This is not a stiff settlement.  But it is a friendly one.



T.D.	Milk.  Never thght they wd. accept 1d. reduction.  And on 1/4 we start new system of 2-tier price under M.M.Bd. – &amp; they share with Ty. any loss on manufg. milk.  Agreed we taper off next year if necessary.

	Eggs. £1.8M. is included.  This plan wd. have saved us £5½M in 1953/4.  Assumes a saving of 1d. on price thro’ scale.

	Pigs.  Wd. have liked to get more.  Marketing cost under free market is additional – means 3/10d. vice 4/3.



Ll.G.	Milk this year may be as big a scandal as eggs in last.

	Stocks of condensed milk = 12 mos. supply now.

M.M.Bd. seek redn. of 1½d. as minimum.



T.D.		Won’t get it by agreement.



H.C.		Agreement is cheaply bought for £2M.

On milk cdn’t we say tht., if there is over prodn., we shall insist on drastic reduction next year.



R.A.B.		Must warn Turner he is heading for serious trouble.

		We cd. have got more off milk – we ought to get more off.

		We all agree with that.  Shd. we not press them further.

Invite T.D. to conclude settlement on agreed basis but to try for another ¼d. off milk.



Agreed.

							[Enter G.Ll.



	5.	Persia.



A.E.	Compensation A.I.O.C want to secure it by lump sum + annual paymts from partners in consortium.  Partners willing to pay in cash only ¼ of AIOC figure.



	Also want Persians to buy at prodn. cost &amp; deliver 10% ……  I don’t think this is reasonable. 

U.S. Fr. &amp; others have all said they won’t have this plan.

	U.S. Cos have told AIOC they won’t have this.  Fraser will now try another method.  If he produces reasonable sum, I shall tell him to clinch at once &amp; start negotns. in Persia.  He wd. like Shawcross to go out when co. repvs. start negotiating.  Unsuitable – member of former Govt.  Persians will misunderstand : will assume Govt is in it.  Cos. are to negotiate.



P.M.	This may be left to A.E.’s judgement.
