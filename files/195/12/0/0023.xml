C. 34(54)							20th May, 1954



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter B-H.



H.C.	Business for next week.





		2.	Teachers’ Superannuation Bill.



R.A.B.	Draft statement prepared in consultn. with Ministers concerned.

	Discussed and approved – as drafted.



P.M.	When shd. it be announced?



B.H.	Not today because of troubles on Members’ Expenses.  Same Members who don’t want anything done on that are in favour of going on with this Bill.



F.H.	Wd. prefer to have it to-day.  For have to address Tory teachers on Saty.



B.H.	Don’t press the point.  Better to volunteer it to-day than to have it extracted by P.Q. on Tuesday.



		Agreed :	L.P.S. to make statement today.





		3.	Expenses of Members of Parliament.



H.C.	Can say to-day there is to be debate on Monday &amp;I understand there will be all-Party motion.	Agreed.



R.A.B.	Two possibilities.  i) accept this motion, allowing free vote.  Ques then is attitude of Govt.  P.M. shd. spk., indicatg. it is H/C. matter &amp; there will be a free vote.  How then wd. Ministers vote?  My view is that Cab. Ministers in H/C. shd. abstain.

	Diffies. v. lively debate in 1922 Cttee.  But my alternative is so close to this in result tht. we shd. seem to be fighting on a ridiculously small diffce.

	ii)  put fwd. Govt. amendment to motion favouring allowances within limit of £500. necessarily incurred in Parly. duties.

	Wd. be same as addl. £500 salary except for poorest, who claim tax relief on less than £500, or richest, who can make a claim for more than £1.000.

	Advantage : Whips cd. be put on.  Awkward for those Govt. supporters who have put names to other motion.



O.L.	Prefer (ii) because it does refer in terms to expenses.



B.H.	Feeling of Govt. supporters.  Large body favour no action.

	More think nothg. shd. be done, or take effect, until after Election.

	This opinion was not reflected in first debate.

	All Whips think only method wh. wd. avoid trouble in Party is (ii).

	Straight salary increase won’t be readily accepted. 



P.M.	I’m willing to tell 1922 tht. we shall allow free vote on all-Party motion.  This will provide for Members’ needs, while at same time giving our people chance to vote against it.  What more can a Member ask than opportunity to vote against it.



R.A.B.	Reported that authors of all-Party motion wd. accept method (ii).

	That wd. mean a Govt. motion.  And some of our supporters wd. vote against us.



B.H.	No.  They might be content to put fwd. (ii) as theirs, if they knew we wd. accept it.



M.F.	If they wd. accept ii) that wd. be best solution.

	There is a real diffce. betwn. salary &amp; allowance.

	Great feeling in country v. increase of salary.

	It wd. still be private Members’ motion &amp; there wd. still be free vote.



W.M.	That wd. give all advantages.



P.T.	If we negotiated ii) shd. we not be assuming responsibility for it.



O.L.	Better for reputation of H/C. to have ii).



P.M.	I am unwilling to advocate ii) to 1922 Cttee.

	I wd. abstain on ii) if put as amendment.  But would vote in favour of all-Party motion. 



R.A.B.	I wd. have to vote for ii) if put as amendmt. for it is so near to what I said in first debate.



P.M.	V. well : I’m ready to express preference for ii) if you like.



R.A.B.	Having regard to views of Party &amp; Cabinet, I wd. get private Member to move ii), indicate that we wd. support it &amp; see if it’s carried.

	If it is not, let all-Party motion go thro’ but Ministers shd. abstain.  Free vote on both.

	If that is our plan, we shd. see tht. ii) is tabled (or agreed to be tabled) before 1922 Cttee.



H.C.	Agree.  Doubt if amendment will be carried.



P.M.	Agree on reflection we shd. have to vote for ii)



J.S.	Advise P.M. not to go to 1922 Cttee.



R.A.B.	Salaries of Junior Ministers.  Advise we should leave that to July or autumn.  In debate we cd. say that we shall deal with that.



J.S.	No Minister shd. vote against (ii).



P.M.	L.P.S. &amp; R.A.B.



							           [Enter O.P., I.McL.

		4.	Proceedings against Aneurin Bevan.		[Exit I.McL O.P.



Sim.	Reported results of enquiry.





		5.	British Honduras.



O.L.	As in memo.		Approved.





		6.	Transfer of High Commission Territories.



Sw.	Decline Ministerial talks on transfer – in Pretoria or in London.

	But, if that is dead, suggest Min. talks in Nov. on def., pol. &amp; econ. questions. But this cd. not be publicly described as including transfer.



Sal.	Support that course.  We shall be presumed to be about to give way, if we offer to talk.  We cd. hear what they have to say in Nov. if they come.



	Agreed.





		7.	Railway Strike.



W.M.	Has not spread beyond W. Region – tho’ it has gone to Cardiff, where a 4th. depot (coal) may also stop to-day.

	On other hand, Swansea has agreed not to come out.

	Response to decisions to strike has not bn. 100% - even in Cardiff.	

	Confined therefore to some only of depots in W. Region and even in these not wholly heeded.
