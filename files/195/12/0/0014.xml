C. 26(54)							7th April, 1954



		1.	Royal Tour.					[Enter B-H.



O.L.	Risk tht. M.M. terrorist might get down to Uganda fr. Kenya.

	Govr. likely to recommend cutting visit to Kampala (drive) – wh. is only substantial risk – and tht. she flies both ways to Dam.

	Hope Cabinet will authorise me to agree to that, if it proposed.



P.M.	Do that – at least.  I wd. prefer she shd. not be exposed to any risk.

	What about Ceylon?



Sw.	N.S. Yd. are fully satisfied with precautions proposed.



P.M.	CRO responsibility to bring to Cabinet any doubts on this.





		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Business for next week.

	Easter Recess.  Thursday 15th. to Tuesday 27th. April.

	Teachers’ Superannuation Bill.  Shd. we take it on 13/4.



B.H.	3 will abstain : 20 won’t promise to vote and are unreliable.  Govt. supporters.

	With 20 or so sick or absent I can’t guarantee a majority.

	Labour &amp; Liberals are solidly opposed to it.

	Thus, quite a chance of a defeat.

	Whips think, however, tht. prospects may worsen with delay.



F.H.	If it is deferred again, we shan’t get it – ever.

	Tories who have supported our case will be angry at w’drawal.

	N.U.T. confce. Easter will increase opposn.

	Our case is known to public.  Press support it.  It is right on merits : 6% is right figure paid in comparable schemes.  We shall therefore be shown to have given way to teachers &amp; revolt by some Tory supporters, who aren’t v. reputable Members.

	L.a.’s are apprehensive tht, if we relent, they won’t be able to hold contns. to their other superannuation schemes.

	Will certainly have repercussions on all other contriby. schemes.

	Believe we cd. persuade 50% of doubters.  We cd. use mounting anger of others, who don’t want us to run away.



R.A.B.	Small thing elevated into ques of principle.  Most of our people feel v. strongly that we shd. go on.

	Believe we cd. get 2nd. Rdg.  More diff. to carry Clause 1.

	On balance, I believe we shall get it.  Tho’ a gt. risk.



P.M.	Govt. with so small a majority is justified in proposing only such legn. as it can carry.

F.H.	Decided in July ’52.  Much work done on it since.

	Believe tht., if 2nd. Rdg. passed, waiverers wd. not persist in opposn.



P.M.	What wd. happen if we were defeated?

	Shd. we stake country’s fortunes on this?

	Considerable misgivings.



A.E.	What shd. we do if defeated?



P.M.	Not bound to resign.  Cd. merely drop Bill.  Invite vote of confidence.



H.M.	3rd. Rdg. of Housing Bill on 14/4.  We cdn’t carry that, if Teachers Bill went wrong.  Might be debating vote of confidence.

	H bomb debate cd. be alleged as reason for p’poning this Bill.  Have lost a day in consequence.



F.H.	If deferred until after Easter, we shd. have to say we were going to do it after Easter.  Also Teachers’ Conferences at Easter will increase our difficulties.



J.S.	If we are to pass this Bill, do it as soon as poss.

	P’ponemt. until after Easter cd. be accepted if we announced now tht. it wd. be taken in first week after Recess.



A.E.	We do want Housing Bill – with a good majority – before Easter.

	Better take that on Tuesday, 13/4.



P.M.	Favour deciding to defer, and taking no other decision.

	Also clear tht. we shd. take Housing Bill on Tuesday to ensure a good majority.



L.P.S.	Believe we shd. go on with Bill.  Unlikely to be defeated.  If we are, we need not resign.  It is not a major matter.



P.M.	Not before Easter.

	Consider, in smaller gathering, wthr we say Thurs. what we say about our future intention.



F.H.	Also what we say to our supporters, privately.



J.S.	H-Bomb altered our business.  For convenience of House now propose to take Housing Tuesd. [&amp; Teachers after Easter.]



AE.	Or say [  ] privately.  Or not at all.  Merely avoid

		saying we aren’t going on with it.



L.P.S.	To consider &amp; report to P.M. what is to be said or not said on Teachers’ Bill.





		3.	Indo-China.



P.M.	Letter from Eisenhower.  Mentioned not read.



A.E.	U.S. Ambassador brought me last night digest of series of messages.

	U.S. diplomacy at its worst.

	U.S. now dislike idea of mtg. Chinese at Geneva.  Suggest therefore threats in advance to intimidate Chinese.  Doubt if this will succeed.

	Dulles made his speech before consultg us.  Tho’ I urged him to avoid reference to “united action”.

	Dulles now suggests coming to Ldn. for consultn.

	Some merits in plan if we cd. get it into right shape. We dislike 

Anzus : wd. welcome substn. of 5 Power pact incldg. U.K.  But what of I-China itself?  I don’t want to commit U.K. there.

	Prefer tht. Fr. shd. fight &amp; U.S. aid.  Wd. sooner use Pact as a SEA/NATO.  Don’t think Fr. can lose before Geneva.  No mil. urgency.  This is pol. ques : how to handle Geneva.



	Least obj. soln. of I/China is partition : giving H. ch. M. part &amp; makg the other subject to Allied guarantee.  U.S. will dislike – fear it will lead to further encroachmt.  But what else cd. we do, unless U.S. willing to put much mil. force into I/Ch.



	What about Dulles?  Best line is for us to try to re-shape U.S. plan.

	Better therefore to let D. come here next week (e.g. Mon.).  M’while, I will try to prepare for Cab. what I think is best plan – on lines of a N.A.T.O. for S.E.A.  Wd. involve U.S. support of us in H-Kong and Malaya.  Disadv. : leads us into mil. commitmts. in I/China.

	When rains begin, we shall have 3/4 months in wh. to consider.



P.M.	Don’t like telling Doms. etc. our views before we see D.



A.E.	But he has bn. talking to them – &amp; they are asking our views.

	At this stage we needn’t say much.



P.M.	Read Eisenhower’s letter.  V. important.  Raises whole issue of closer co-opn. betwn. U.K. &amp; U.S. which alone can save the world.

	Read Menzies message.



Sw.	Latter supports A.E.’s preference for delay.



A.E.	Declaration won’t hearten French or frighten China.

	And R. might take it as excuse for not coming to Geneva.

	I don’t want any decln. before Geneva – tho’ we shd. make a plan.

	Two telegrams just recd. from Spender.  He says D. stressed 

	Key posn. of U.K.  Has met Congr. leaders : satisfd. Congr. wd. support D.’s plan but not unless U.K. wd. join in direct mil. help to I/China.  U.S. wd. have to re-consider plan if U.K. wdn’t join.  U.N. cd. not be brought in at outset because of urgency.



Sw.	Holland has asked for immedte. consultn.  Mention naval &amp; air action : doubts its efficacy : recalls tht. this is what U.S. thght at outset of Korea.



A.E.	Fr. have enormous preponderance in air : and it hasn’t enabled them to win.



P.M.	This wd. excite gt. controversy here.  But alternative may be U.S. w’drawal to peripheral defence.  Can’t lose them.  Real. risk tht. she mght go it alone, if we won’t go along with them.  And that wd. expose us to awful danger.



Sal.	Alarmed at use of threat now.  May increase deadlock – Ch. refusal to attend Geneva.  Or show Ch. not amenable – then U.S. wdn’t go.

	Wd. like D. to come here.  But public will think he is coming over H-bomb.

	And we shan’t be able to avoid wider discn. than I/China.

	Air-action v. China will provoke ques here wthr tht. involves use of a. weapons.  If we join coalition, we must know their intentions on that.



P.M.  	Agreed.



O.L.	Genl. approach has enormous advantages fr our posn. in S.E.A.  Tho’ untimely we must not reject it.

							       [Exit B-H.



A.E.	If he comes, and we can’t accept his plan, US/UK coopn. will be injured.  But if we accept it, it kills Geneva.



		Agreed :	P.M. to tell Eis. we shd. welcome D.  But these 			are grave issues on wh. I wdn’t wish to 				pronounce until we have talked.



M.F.	Stressed gravity of para. 4.

	No decln. before Geneva.





		4.	British Honduras.



O.L.	Have amended final para. of draft statement.  Read new version.



Sw.	Improvement.



A.E.	Yes : meets my doubt.



O.L.	P.U.P. aren’t communists.  Violently anti-Br.  Assert independence in external relations.

	Govr. and H.H. think revelations re Guatemala will affect P.U.P.’s chances in elections. I am not sure.



A.E.	My advisers think Honduras are growing less fond of Guatemalans.



P.M.	Why allow elections?



O.L.	Report alone is not enough to warrant disfranchising Hondurans.



O.L.	If I delay constitution, there will be trouble – &amp; I may need troops.



Sw.	Delay of elections wd. unite all sections against us.



P.M.	Expressed repeated doubts.



Sal.	Support O.L.’s course, because only one open.  But exposes folly of our position : we don’t really believe these people are fit for independence.



O.L.	There are still reserve powers.

	We didn’t embark on adult suffrage in W. Indies.  But we are committed to it.

	Worse to put constitn. into force &amp; then have to suspend it.





		5.	Parliament : Expenses of Members.

								[Enter B.H.

P.M.	Mtg. with Tory Party this p.m.

	Do we accept lodging allowances.  Hope we shall add other allowances for telephones etc., also.



R.A.B.	Suggest we put to Party the draft statement.

	Then go on to discuss Plan I.  London M.P.’s : might offer a smaller (day) allowance to them.  Invite their views on that.



A.E.	Omit penultimate para.  Don’t offer that.



H.C.	Also para. 5 – “what is wrong”.  Don’t admit that.  Say “subject of complaint”.



Sw.	No mention of Peers.



R.A.B.	Plan I cd. be applied to them.



Sal.	For M.P.’s this will be super-imposed on a large salary.

	Cumberland Hotel charge 50/= minimum p. day.  That means a

	loss of 8/= a day for Peers.  Attendance in H/L. is already impaired by sheer inability to come to Ldn.  I can’t keep H/L going properly on this basis.  Must make this protest.



B.H.	Whips think Members will be relieved tht. there isn’t to be a salary increase.  This will prob. go rather well.  But if you bring in Peers this p.m. you will spoil it.



P.M.	No need to tell H/C. what you propose re Peers.



A.E.	Must tell them sometime because they will have to vote the Money.



RAB.	Can’t pay Peers even on attendance basis, pending reform.

	Must therefore be subsistence allowances only.  Cd. they be larger than for H/C. because of no salary.



Sal.	Cost wd. be v. small.



R.A.B.	But that isn’t the point.



Sal.	Waiting until after reform : p’ponemt. until Gk. Kalends.



RAB.	For H/L. might link subsistce. allowce.  with attendances, as is done with travel.



P.M.	Cd. say today : there will have to be counterpart for H/L.

	Must do something for Ldn Members.  21= or 25/=.
