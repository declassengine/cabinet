C. 13(54)								1st March, 1954



		1.	Sudan.						[Enter B-H.



P.M.	Historically, it is just.  Tribes that followed Mahdi were roused by years of oppression &amp; exploitn. by Egypt.  If I had the power, I wd. at once send 2 battns. to Khartoum – to preserve order, &amp; developmt. of Sudanese liberties, and to save life.  Plus 2 RAF squadrons.  From Egypt.



A.E.		There is a battn. there, and they didn’t even bring them out of barracks.



P.M.		But a pretext for first step in redeployment in M/East.

	A useful thing is to have a force there which cd. cut them off fr. Egypt.  We cd. carry on processes of new constitn., while m’taining order.  A good place to keep troops in M/E?



Al.	Not in our plan : but wd. be easy to put some there.



P.M.	I suggested this 3 months or so ago: but agreed that that was not the moment.  This may be – and may be the last.

Hope A.E. will consider this.



A.E.		What is their purpose?  To defend S. against E.

Neguib is going home : and other guests are dispersing.  Whole business deferred until (?) 10/3.



Sal.		What is the constitutional posn. of B. troops in Sudan?



A.E.	Govr. is still responsible for law &amp; order : cd. appeal for more troops – to both co-Domini.

Doubt if any section of S. opinion wd. welcome re-inforcement of Br. troops.



P.M.		20 killed &amp; 100 injured : a serious situation.



A.E.		No word from Gov. Genl : presumably Palace is cut off.



P.M.	Might be beginning of civil war.  They can’t advance twds independence unless law &amp; order is preserved.

		If these were in Sudan, no political diffy. in w’drawing from E.



R.A.B	The start wd. have to be – Howe askg. for more troops : but we wd. have to say that he doesn’t want E. troops only Br. troops.  Wd. he do that?



P.M.	I wdn’t exclude possibility of allowg. some E. troops to go in too.



A.E.	A fresh commitment.  Strategically less useful in new pattern of M/E defence than posns. further north e.g. in Libya &amp; Cyprus.

(I will consider possibilities and Howe’s powers and report

(to P.M. to-morrow.  Will also ask S.Ll. to stay until ordered

(and give us his appreciation of situation.





	2.	Egypt.



A.E.	Read latest tel. from Cairo.

	Sounds somewhat unsettled.



P.M.	Can we have much faith in an agreement concluded with such a régime?



A.E.	We shall make one only if it suits us: and if they broker it thereafter our hands wd. be free.





	3.	Kenya : General China.



P.M.	Tel. No. 185 from O.L. in Kenya.

	O.L was v. reluctant to use China in this way.  Now on the spot he favours this action.  I suggest we give him discretion to proceed as he wishes.



Sw.	Submit this course shd. be supported.  Surrender of leaders will discredit them with their followers.



M.F.	Support O.L.



Sal.	      “         “	Agreed.





	4.	Teachers’ Superannuation.



F.H.	Secretary N.U.T has asked if I have any developmts to discuss with them.  I have offered to see them &amp; consider any suggns. they have to make.



R.A.B.	Dissident Tory supporters have asked for time (until Thurs.) to formulate their proposals.   They shd. have some guidance fr. a Minister : have told them to approach L.P.S. and F.H.



P.M.	Wd. have preferred to avoid a row on this.  But am coming to the concln. that, as things are, we ought to show firmness: and ram it down their throats.  Esp. against background of Labour vacillation on defence &amp; f. policy.



R.A.B.	Welcome this support.  But prefer to take more time to present it.  It is not of 1st. class constitutional importance.



F.H.	We shd. try to save faces of our rebels and teachers, if we can.



J.S.	Stand firm, but welcome 2 wks’ delay.





	5.	Service Pay.



RAB.	Substantial leakage.  Esp. in D. Telegraph – including reference is my view.  Mil. correspondent.



Al.	No interest to Serv. Dpts. to have premature speculation – wh. leads to disappointment.  Diminishes credit.

		

P.M.	Enquiry shd. be made.
