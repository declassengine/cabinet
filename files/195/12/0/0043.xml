C. 54(54)							27th July, 1954



		1.	European Defence Community.		[Enter B.H.



A.E.	Discussed E.D.C. with Massigli last night.  Not unpromising.  M.  France plan : either i) agree some amendmts. with EDC Powers &amp; make them after ratification.  Ratififn. then prs. by end/Aug.  If that fails ii) he will consult us in Aug. on alternatives.

	Separation of Bonn Treaties.  P.Q. y’day.  Will be raised again Thursday.

	Suggest we then say it doesn’t involve G. re-armament and need not therefore involve recall of Parlt.





		2.	Egypt : Defence Negotiatons.	



A.E.	Tel. from A.H. Cairo 870. They have accepted 20 months.  Means 2 yrs. from now because dates fr. Treaty.  Hopes for better Clause 8 – expects agreemt. on that.  He may finish to-day or to-morrow.

	Shd. therefore be poss. to make statement Thurs. &amp; have it debated in first half of Friday.

	Good thing to get it over before recess.



J.S.	They may ask for it to be taken at once – after 7 p.m. on Thursday.



A.E.	Friday wd. give them more time to consider.



B.H.	Cd. be no vote on Thurs : there cd. be one on Fri. – and we shd. have poor majority.



H.C.	Wd. wish to consult Oppn. on choice of day.



								[Exit B.H.

		3.	Housing Subsidies.



H.M.	This year 360,000 houses will be completed.  Next year is more doubtful because uncertainty introduced by rapid growth of private enterprise bldg.  130,000 of these may be built next year.

	I want to expand this, but be able at same time to say that l.a. houses are still being built in nos. as large as those reached by Labour Govt.

	Want to keep those above the 1951 figure.

	Must therefore steady l.a. p’mme.  Two methods – i) administrative on “allocation”  ii) financial : differential subsidy rates.  Saving to Exchequer is not v. large – prs. £1M. p.a. when scheme is running.

	Fr. pt. view of future ii) is better method.

	But, even tho’ Cab. agree with that view, timing shd. be considered.

	(i) wd. be less noticed by public.  Cd. manage that way this year.

	Bldg. industry is resilient.  Always does more than seems possible on statistics.

O.L.	Timing.  Governed by people’s feeling on housing shortage.  There are still some hard cases.  They shd. soon be met.  That will be time to introduce (ii).  Doubt if public opinion is quite ripe for it.



H.C.	(ii) is right method : shd. apply it as soon as we can.

	But Party view (as judged by M/H) is that this wd. be unpopular.  Our people have enough to do now in explaining Rents Bill.

	Wd. prefer therefore to use method (i) this autumn, and put (i) forward as policy at next Election.  That wd. avoid legn. next Session.



R.A.B.	Qua national economy (ii) is right – &amp; shd. be done as soon as possible.

	Housing is using too much of resources of bldg. industry.  Industrial bldg shd. have bigger share.  Favour earlier action, rather than later.



A.E.	Accept the principle.  But in some areas shortage is as great as ever.

	e.g. in Midlands because of industrial expansion.  Situation differs fr. one area to another.



H.M.	Wd. be content to have this policy (ii) approved, but to leave over until autumn a decn. on timing.



F.H.	Method (i) enables geographical discrimination to be applied – more effective for that than method (ii).



P.T.	Content to accept p’ponemt. of decision until autumn.  But want (ii) applied as soon as possible.



J.S.	In Scotland we cdn’t apply (ii) yet.  P’ponement wd. suit me.





		4.	Defence Expenditure.		[Enter J.T., de L., Hutchn., Birch., 							D.S., C.O.S.



Sal.	Proposals in paras. 4-9.  Services have made gt. efforts.

	Draw special attention to para. 9.

	The gap : £130 M.  Towards this £80 M. might be found if we made no provision for G. costs.  Unlikely tht. it wd. all be needed – &amp; cd. be met by Suppl. Estimate.

	M/Def. is convinced no further substantial cuts can be made (§.17).

	Integrn. with Comm. is for Sw.

	Refer to memo. by M/Supply.  Para. 5.  Cttee. proceeded on basis that this had all bn. considered by M/D. &amp; it was not for us to do his work all over again.



D.S.	Proposals are of enormous importance.

	W’in t. of r. of Cttee. to consider balance of effort.  Think they still should do so.  Either Cab. or Cttee. shd. surely look at this issue.  Shall be open to searchg. criticism : must be ready to defend proposals.



de L.	Time has bn. too short to allow discn. of synthesis of proposals.

	We shd. go into it – but quickly.



R.A.B.	Suggest Cab. shd. take definite decision on what is in Rpt.

	Further examn. cd. continue.

	Services have done their best.  But Cttee. did not probe into M/D. or Service Ministers.

	Doubtful re size of Bomber Force.

	£1640 this year : £1630 next – won’t look like “substantial relief”.

	Shall be doing little more than compensate for increased costs.

	Ready to make no allowance at first for Germany.  Gives £1550 – and a contingency of £30-40 M. for G.  A total of £1590 wd. deprive me of chance of tax relief.

	Accept this report pro tem.  But consider what more mght. be done on lines of M/S. memo.



A.E.	Public will be shocked – e.g. reduction in Fighter Command.

	Will need v. careful presentn.

	Bombers.  Have we not to rely mainly on U.S. for this?

	Not convinced tht. 240 figure shd. stand w’out re-examinn.

	Believe we shd. discuss with U.S.



C.A.S.	U.S. total bomber force is 2.000.



D.S.	Redn. wd. come at far end.



A.E.	Yes : but don’t get committed now to 240.

	Germany.  If EDC came in by 1/9 (earliest) cost to us wd. not exceed £60 M.  If it came in on 1/1/55 cost wd. be £30 M.

	Stress need for v. careful presentn.

	When will we have an effective new fighter?  Or must we reconcile ourselves to fact tht. deterrent is our only defence.



Sw.	Effect in Commonwealth.  Wd. need v. careful presentn. to Doms.

	Para 19 of C.O.S. report.  Doms. haven’t faced that.  We have encouraged them to look to us for supplies.

	Cdn’t launch this policy here w’out full consultn. with them.

	Mght cause them to switch their reliance to U.S. – for equipment etc.,  Consider pol., as well as mil., consequences.



M.F.	Drew attention to para. 12.  Contrast with cut proposed in para 13.

	Para. 18.  C.D. policy must be presented as part of a revised defence policy as a whole.

	Only a presentn. of great weight &amp; authority will get this across.

	Must be sure of keeping morale &amp; opinion steadily behind such a policy.



Sal.	But, even with drastic proposals made, we still haven’t closed gap.



P.M.	In principle, deterrent is right.  But if, to achieve that, you have to strip away what defence you have – it becomes v. diff. to justify to public opinion.



D.S.	This plan doesn’t involve disbanding air defence.

	Deterrent is, not only our power to attack, but same power to thwart a surprise attack.



P.M.	Main deterrent is from U.S. – ten times the strength we plan.



D.S.	No magic in 240.  But we can’t leave to U.S. wholly the role of counter attack on R. airports fr. which attacks on us may be delivered.  There is a minimum force which we must have.



P.M.	We shd. devote next 2 months to study of disputable elements.

	M/S. memo. indicates need for this.  Review of distribution of available resources.

	Suggest small Cttee. – Sw., M/D., M/Supply shd. do this and submit recommns. to Cab. by mid/September.

	They shd. take full a/c. of fact tht. U.S. will be our Ally.



R.A.B.	This was worked out on basis of new strategy.



H.C.	Hope no W.Paper need be presented until Feby.



de L.	Ready that plans shd. go fwd. on basis of report, while detailed study continues.



Birch.	Consider impact on public when draft W. Paper is ready.



RAB.	I may just be able to do what I want on this basis.



D.S.	Cd. we not approve £1630 : but consider wtr any more can be found &amp; be allowed to consider p’mme adjustments in process.



R.A.B.	M/D. &amp; Serv. Ministers have agreed on this p’mme.  Need we put it all into melting pot?  Can’t we accept what is proposed.  Also, can we have a chance to consider yr. suggn. of a new Cttee.

	Need for early decisions if savings are to be secured on prodn. p’mmes.

			{     Suggest this report be approved as basis for prepn.

	Suggested	{     of Estimates &amp; for prodn. p’mmes.

	decision for	{     M’while let us examine M/S. points &amp; any raised

	today.		{x|   in discussion.  Hope for some further savings.

			{      Let us also see draft of W. Paper to see what it			{      looks like.



			No overt action w’out consultn. with Cabinet.



Sw.	May we discuss with RAB., Sw., M/S. &amp; Service Ministers procedure for x/.
