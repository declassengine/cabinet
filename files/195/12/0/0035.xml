C. 46(54)							6th July, 1954



		1.	Aden.						[Enter B.H.



R.A.B.	A.E. has authorised despatch of note to Yemen Govt.

	P.M. has made to M/D. suggns. re use of ground troops.





		2.	High Commission Territories.



Sw.		As in memo. 						[Enter M.F.

	Satisfied Malan has raised this for political capital in f’coming elections.

	If he wins those, he may have ⅔rds majority in Senate as well as lower House &amp; will be able to carry “native” policy legn.

	I therefore recommend, to counter this, full objective &amp; historical reply.

	Ths wd. correct some of Malan’s omissions &amp; misrepresentns.

	Convenient to have a full answer on record, for publn. if Malan continues to misrepresent posn.  Wd. be effective here &amp; mght have some effect in S. Africa.



Sal.	Endorse procedure.

	But para. 6 – U.K. pledges re consultg. natives.  Then para. 12 goes further : implies native consent.  Have we gone we so far?

	Better :[“common ground tht. views of native popns. must carry great weight”]?



Sw.	Herzog said this.  Wd. not insist on their coming in unless they are prepd. and desire to come in.

	And we have said we wdn’t submit them to transfer v. their will.

	If we weaken it now, M. will exploit the change.



Sal.	Put [  ] first &amp; continue : “indeed, Genl. H. himself said …”



H.M.	Awkward that less strong statement is in historical part (para 6) &amp; the stronger one in the argumentative para 12.



Sw.	Wd. transfer reference to Herzog para 12 to para 6.

	Delete 1st. sentence of para 12 &amp; run straight on from para. 11. Omit [ ]    from para 12. (viz., the further reference to “prepared &amp; desire to come in”.



Sal.	Para. 11 – say “relevance” vice “effect” of native policy.



R.A.B.	Frank references to native policy in para. 12 may mean tht. this paper is used in local politics.



Sw.	Can’t avoid grasping this nettle.



O.L.	This is nub of whole problem.

	Agreed : omit 2nd. sentence of para. 11.



W.	Para 12.  “They wd. not willingly accept ….”  “In these circs. U.K. Parlt wd. not …..”



Sal.	“Without expressing any view on that policy, it is certain that they wd. not willingly …..”



		Agreed :	Sw. to submit re-draft in light of points raised in 			discussion.



		3.	Parliament : Members’ Expenses.



R.A.B.	Saw CRA alone &amp; refrained from detail.

	Y’day we spent an hour, 3 a side.  Evident they wd. like to get something for their poorer Members.  Gave them subsistence plan.  They countered Ldn. Members’ expenses almost as great because of high living cost in Ldn.

	At end they came down in favour of flat-rate allowance to all equally.

	They seek another mtg. on Wedy. before their next Party mtg. 

	My impression (their other objn. to subsistence is linking allowance with attendance.  Diffy. of defining attendance.  Abuse in L.C.C. bringing system into disrepute : Morrison.  M.P.’s won’t adhere to rules.  Or will be charged with breach, if seen at cinema.  Are they to draw allowances while sick, or abroad e.g. at C/Europe?  We said no : strict enforcemt.  What, they said, of pairs – made after beginning of Parly. day.)  Think they wd. accept allowance based on £2 a day for 4 days a week, Sessional (regardless of attendance).  Cd. be paid monthly – as re-imbursement of expenses &amp; wd. need to be justified to Revenue in tax claim.



L.P.S.	They wd. like to settle.  They wd. take almost anything – but raised all the snags in subsistence scheme.  I was impressed by argument of higher living cost in Ldn. for Members resident in Ldn.  They feared a good deal of cheating on claims – and resulting scandal.



R.A.B.	We offered retrospection.



Sal.	Wd. you prescribe any minimum no. of attendances?  Cd. a man draw £8 a wk. &amp; never go to W’minster?



B.H.	Believe Tories in H/C. wd. accept this, if Labour took it – partly to end diffies. over pairing.

	It is related to days, not per annum – has element of subsistence.

	And refers only to sitting days.

	It is therefore somewhere betwn 2 schemes considered by Cabinet.



R.A.B.	Annual amount wd. not exceed £280 &amp; might average £250 – according to length of Session.



W.	For opinion in country, much will depend on presentn.

	Might be accepted if presented as subsistence for 4 sitting’s days of each week of Session.



Sw.	Can justify it if we can put it as convenient way of applying subsistence principle.



M.F.	Impressed by arguments of B.H.  Wd. be prepared to accept this.



F.H.	Will it be called “subsistence”.



R.A.B.	Don’t think you can – must be “necessary expenses”.  I.R. difficulty.



F.H.	Then you will be in trouble.

	Think you will also have diffy. in defending same treatment for Ldn. Members.



H.M.	Invent a phrase – “Parly. Sessional allowance”.  Or “Sessional subsistence allowce.”.



R.A.B.	Form of Parly. statement will need careful thought.

	Will submit draft to P.M. on his return.



	Agreed.	RAB. authd. to proceed with discns. with Oppn. on these 		lines.  Draft of Parly. statement to come to Cabinet 			thereafter.





		4.	Housing Subsidies.



H.M.	Order needs affirmative resoln.  Recognise it may not be poss. to find time for this before recess.  But if Order is laid, Opposn. will be checked – l.a. deputns. etc., will be laid off.

	If Oppn. wanted to debate it before recess, they might give time.



R.A.B.	Support this proposal.



H.M.	It will show tht. Govt. are committed to this.



L.P.S.	Cd. take it in spill-over.  Or allow Oppn. to find time for it before recess.





		5.	Gatwick Airport.



H.M.	M/T. said report of enquiry wd. be publd.  I am being asked (P.Q.) when.  Do you consider it first &amp; publish with our decision.

	Or do we publish &amp; allow public discussion to proceed.

	If we sit on it for months, people will think there’s some dirt in it.



		Agreed : Publish and be dammed.





		6.	Underground Car Parks.



Sal.	H.A. Cttee. discussed Car Park Shelters : &amp; authorised M/T. to explore.

	Press has bn. given impn. tht. Govt. favour this.  In fact Cttee. as a whole were against it.  Think Cabinet shd. know.



M.F.	Don’t see how we can retrieve this.



R.A.B.	Can discuss with M/T. when D.P. Cttee. meet this p.m.





		7.	Finance Bill.



R.A.B.	Dalton’s new clause.  No reason why Govt. shd. not accept this.

	Cost £400,000 this year.  £1M. in full year.  Wd. have to put revised version.

	To reduce estate duty on small estates.

	Is it a political trap?



H.C.	Bid for popularity with small people – not in line with Socialist doctrine.

	No economic effects.  Won’t be popular with our people who want substantial redn. of death duties for economic reasons.



Sal.	Part of Dalton’s theory that poor shd. be relieved of all taxation.



		Agreed :	RAB authorised to accept this subject to

				reference to Tory Cttee.





		8.	Ceylon.



Sw.	Govr. of Ceylon Bank accused of malpractice – suspended for enquiry.

	He has countered by attack on Goon, whose apptmt. as Govr. Genl. is now to be suspended pending enquiry.

	Must expect a pretty fruity scandal.
