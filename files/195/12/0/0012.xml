C. 24(54)							31st March, 1954



		1.	London Fares.					[Enter A.L.B.



A.L.B.	As in memo.  They have strong case for having their claim considered.

	The 2 Applns. will be made together.  No increases cd. result before Sept.



M.F.	Unwise to give direction with a view to stopping this appln.



		Approved.



							[Exit A.L.B.

		2.	Equal Pay.



R.A.B.	Reviewed our earlier statements in our manifestos.  We are deeply involved.  What shall we say in our next manifesto?  Repeat the old promise.  Or say we can’t do it.

	How cd. we start.  In Civil Service : on condns.  i) agreed scheme with Union  ii) gradual scheme over 5 years – during which we cd consider compensating allowances for men with larger families.

	£2 M. in first year, rising to £13 M in fifth.

	Teachers.  Wd. be for Burnham Cttee. to follow my (gradual) lead.

	They wd. probably follow, w’in a year.  60% of cost wd. be on Ty.

	Believe it’s best to make a start.

	If we don’t, we shall lose power to control it.

	On balance, I favour going ahead with it.



O.L.	Don’t believe it will spread to industry.



P.T.	But it involves (full) commitment of £30 M. or so.  Incongruous when RAB calls for heavy reductions of expenditure.



A.E.	Agree that next manifesto wd. be diff. if we had done nothing.

	But industrial re-action is a counter-weight.  Wd. depend how much industry is being helped otherwise by Budget.



P.T.	Don’t suppose R.A.B. can give help to industry.  He can’t, until there is real redn. in public expenditure.



W.	Don’t believe there are votes in this either way.



M.F.	May lose votes for not doing it.



RAB.	Admit tht. we shall be attacked for not doing more – e.g. gradual and industrials.



P.T.	If it is a political thing why not do it, together with pensions, in next Budget.



	And if RAB contemplates both, when are we going to get redns. in expenditure – and in taxation.

	When are we going to increase our exports?  And to meet competn. of Germany &amp; Japan.



P.M.	RAB exposes himself by this to a charge of inconsistency.

	But he recognises this and, despite it, thinks tht. his Budget needs this adornment.



R.A.B.  	Will review, in light of discussion, &amp; decide.



							         [Exit McL



		3.	High Commission Territories.



Sw.	As in memo.



O.L.	Are you going to publish lr?  Pretty fulsome re economic co.opn.



Sw.	No.  Tho’ I think it cd. be publd. if we had to.



A.E.	Bottom of page.  Put Parly. diffies. separately.



Sw.	Quite ready to omit words after “present time”.



		Approved.

							[Exit Sw.



		4.	German Captured Archives.



A.E.	If we insist on keeping these here, Germans &amp; U.S. will be mad.

	If we send them to Germany, our historians will be mad.



P.M.	Why limit microfilming to Weimar period.    It is the later period tht. is more important.  Can’t we microfilm them all!



A.E.	It goes right up to 1933, when Hitler came into power.

	No need to keep the later pp., for we have covered that in publns.



	Windsor Papers.



	We are arranging to p’pone publn. of this volume.  I propose to get G. &amp; U.S. to agree tht. as quid pro quo, these pp. be retained in U.K.  This compromise plan is best way of getting what we want on those.



P.M.	You cd. if you wished, make non-publn. assurance end with end of Windsor’s life.



H.C.	Shd. prefer that all documents be micro-filmed before return.



A.E.	Will consider that suggn.



R.A.B.	Historians wd. the be less likely to resign.





		5.	Newsprint.



W.	Discussed in E.P.C.  R.A.B. cdn’t agree to their making 4 year contract.

	Their stocks now are so low tht. they mayn’t be able to carry on as now.  They shd. have 100,000 t.  80,000 t. a minimum.  They will soon be down to 65,000 t.  They therefore ask for 25.000 t. to make up stock.  [But they can’t get it fr. Canada w’out contracting for 50,000 t. p.a. for 4 years.]  E.P.C. wdn’t agree.

	I have told newspp. they can have 25.000 t. now but no promise for future.  They have seen me.  They say they must ensure future supplies.  Also [  ] I  Suggested they shd. contract subject to f. exchange being available.  They reminded me tht. U.K. cdn’t let Canada down again on this.  They press therefore for Can. Contract : 50.000 t. in each of 4 years.

	The amount needed to relieve us of all control is 100.000 t. p.a. – viz., Canadian plus another 50,000 from Scandinavia.



R.A.B.	B/p. prospects are gloomier because of decreased U.S. purchases of materials.

	We can’t stand cost of freeing newsprint.



P.T.	We shd. put Canadian Govt. on the spot re forward contracts before we admit inevitability of it.



P.M.	Prefer to decontrol : or at least apply more restns. to magazines.

	Don’t waste money w’out compensatg. advantage.



		Agreed : E.P.C. to consider to-morrow.
