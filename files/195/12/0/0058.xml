P.M.	Regret no reduction.  See para.6.



A.E.	Seems inevitable.



H.C.	Some cd. start in H/L. – and, if Opposn. in H/C. were difficult – they cd. lapse.



RAB.	Contentious legn. has bn. discarded e.g. Teachers’ Superannn. &amp; the natl. element of Sugar Industry Bill.

	New plan for Teachers.  Consistent with honour.  But negotns. will be tough.



A.E.	What do we say in D/Address?



R.A.B.	Good case for re-negotiating new basis for future.



D.E.	Will try : tho’ diff, on basis suggd. by RAB – reduced rate of interest must mean increase contribns.



H.C.	Add Indemnity Bill for G.P.O. – as in memo.



A.E.	May need a Bonn Conventions Bill.



R.A.B.	Numbers are deceptive : many are v. small.  Can’t cut any more.

P.M.	Don’t think this can be delayed.  The theme of ‘deterrent’ shd. be explained – certainty of retaliation.	

							          [Exit A.E.



A.E.	Raises whole ques of our use of atomic weapons.  Are we ready for that?



Sal.	Suggd. amendmt.  



H.M. 	Yes : Then reserve main picture unless Opposn. open that up.  They may not.  Can reserve decision on that for a time.

							            [Exit H.M.



de L.	“Strength” in para. 11.
