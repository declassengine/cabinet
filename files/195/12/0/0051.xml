C. 69(54)							22nd October, 1954



		1.	Industrial Disputes.				[Reading



W.M.	Some improvemt. in atmosphere.  Strikers impd. by conduct of Ct. of Enquiry.

	Might go back after Sunday’s demonstration.

	Deakin anxious to defer use of troops until Wed., hoping for Ct.’s report.

	Use of mil. labour for wider than essential purposes wd. create problems.

	L’pl. want none.  Ldn. port employers don’t favour it for loading exports – lack of skill – also fear tht. it mght extend troubles.

	No significant change in nos.



A.L.B.		Bulbs are rotting in Ldn. docks.  May lead to unemplt. as well as loss.



P.T.		Exports piling up at £5M. a day.  Increasg. diffies. thro’ delay in 

		imports – threat of short-time working because of lack of raw 

materials.  By 	end of next week newspp. will have to reduce to ¼ size 

because of lack of newsprint.

		But agree tht. troops wd. in first instance make sitn. worse.



O.P.		Assistce. Bd. say increasg. nos. of dockers are applying for help for 			wives etc.,

		Economic pressure is evidently increasing.





		2.	Formosa.



R.		A.E.’s tel. No. 5 fr. Paris.

		Better if they wd. include in statement on Treaty their intentn. to bring 		ques of Islands to U.N.  But doubtful if they wd.  And statement re 			Treaty alone may put Ch. in such a fret tht. they will be unwilling to 		consider 2nd. propn. re Islands.

		Statement wd. however mean abandonmt. of suggn. tht. F. is a

priviliged sanctuary.

Suggest we agree to D.’s plan &amp; then, in light of re-action, consider 

wtr atmosphere is fit for going on with Islands plan.



Sal.		Support this.  All wd. depend on tone of U.S. statement.  Buts gets us 		out of diffy. of approaching R. &amp; Ch. w’out mentiong. the Treaty 			intentn.



K.		Agree.



P.T.		Is it clear (para 3) tht. remains open wtr we go on with plan 			thereafter.



R.		Think so.  We aren’t committed to going on w’in 3 days.

		A.E. to have discretion to agree.

							    [Enter H. Amory.

     	3.	Cyprus.



		Broadcasts.



P.M.		No mortal injury done by Archbishop – but don’t like B.B.C. attitude.



A.L.B.		B.B.C. told C.O. when Archb. already invited.  Dangerous then to seek 		to get invitn. w’drawn.



P.M.		Will send a lr. of protest to B.B.C.  Read out.



A.L.B.		Am bringing Press Law of Cyprus into conformity with our own while 		leaving law of sedition untouched.  This will avoid that criticism.



H.C.		Will there be criticism for allowg. Govr. to b’cast in U.K. on political 		issue?



A.L.B.		Precedents for b’casts by Govrs.



H.C.		When there is pol. trouble in U.K. about his territory?  When S of S. 		is available and cd. speak.  Govr. shd. not usurp function of Minister 		responsible for Parlt.  Shd. not explain Govt.’s policy.



A.L.B.    *	Will advise him to change content of his b’cast – to avoid pol. issues.

		Pray in aid the 14 day rule.



		Parliamentary Statement.



Sal.		Favour proposal in para. 8 of C. 319.



ALB.		Turks sent delegn. to N. York &amp; lobbied – made their views clear.



D.S.		The proper time will be when statement is made on Press Law.



ALB.		Can add some robust sentences on sovereignty.



R.		This wd. meet AE because Archb. won’t arrive in N. Yk. for 3 wks.



									[Enter Att.G.

    		4.	Uganda : The Kabaka.



A.L.B.		Trouble wd. have bn. avoided if K. had bn. lectured here &amp; sent back.

		But Govr. advised to contrary.

		Having once deposed him, we are now in difft. posn.

		During my visit I became satisfied tht. weight of evidence of those 			(includg. district officers) on whose judgemt. I wd. most rely is against 		allowg. him to return now he has bn. deposed. Govr., m’while has 

turned round to opposite view : but his subtleties won’t be appreciated.

		If we were free agents, therefore I wd. m’tain his exile.

		But now there is the legal action.  Decision shd. now turn on result of 		that action.  If we win, his deposition shd. stand.  If we lose, we wd. 		have new reason for allowing him to return.



P.M.		Adverse decn. wd. give us worst of both worlds.  Shown to have acted 		wrongly.  and get an unfriendly ruler back.



Att.G.		Mustn’t announce our course before the judgmt.

		If we win, we have a free hand.  If we lose, we can settle policy in new 		situation.

		Two grounds for action : deposed for disloyalty : deported because 		his presence in Uganda was contrary to p. interest.  Adverse decn. on

1st. point doesn’t necessarily dispose of decision of policy on second.



A.L.B.		Need for quick decn., on announcemt. of judgmt – because K. wd. be 		free to return at once.  If we lose, wd. wish to make immedte. statement, 		to stop that (or do my best to do so); and send for him at once.

		If we win, I want to say at once it confirms our policy.



D.S.		On (b), why say anything while appeal is pending?



A.L.B.		Certain to be asked a P.Q.



P.M.		No need to make any statement while it is sub iudice.



P.M.		No decision can be taken until we know what judgment is.

							                                   [Exit Att.G.



           		5.	Canada : Hurricane Damage.



R.		A.E. wants Cab. to consider a contn.  Dutch are giving one.



H.C.		Wait for Sw. who was there.  Returns Sunday.  



Sal. 		Ask Sw. views.



										Agreed.
