C. 78(54)							24th November, 1954



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter P.B.H.



H.C.	Course of D/Address.  Hope to complete on Mon. 6/12 : cd. run on until 7/12.

	Pensions will be blocked by notice of introdn.  F. Affairs have bn. recently discussed.  Cd. offer later day for general ques of gerontics as contrasted with Bill.



A.E.	CRA will almost certainly ask for expln. of phrase in Speech re Defence. I must be able to indicate wtr it will be expld. later in debate.

	I wd. prefer to devote 6/12 to general exposn of Defence – and to speak on it myself.  Deterrent vice defence must be explained.



H.C.	There wd. be Oppn. amendmt., probably, wh. wd. have to be taken on 6/12.



Sw.	We shall finish in H/L. on Wed. or Thurs.  Tactical use of a weapon is sure to be raised in H/L.  We can’t remain silent on it.



A.E.	I agree : and H/L. can’t be given answer before H/C.  Gaitskell’s point in recent debate isn’t easy to answer.



H.M.	From Election pt. of view, you cdn’t open a more delicate series of questions.

	These ques are going to be raised in N.A.T.O.  Actually, unreal : because if attacked, you must defend yourself with what you have.  But politically v. awkward : for suits fellow-travellers to urge that a. weapons shd. not be used so tht. R. man-power superiority can be at advantage.

	Election charge – we have become an a. armed country w’out public knowledge or discussion.

	Cd. we have small debate now to take edge off it, and then have it at greater lengths in February.



P.M.	Must make some mention.  If so, better have some design.



Sal.	Can we do it before N.A.T.O. discussion on 16/Dec?



H.M.	That cd. be argument for not having wide debate in D/Address.



Sal.	If there is to be general debate in H/C., we cd. avoid having it earlier in H/L.

								[Exit Sal.











		2.	Renfrew Maintenance Base.			[Enter J.B.C.



J.B.C.	Saving of £160,000 p.a. now confirmed by indep. assessor.  If we compel them to operate in a way wh. is commercially unsound, we shall have greater diffy. in enforcing economical operation on them.

	P’ponement won’t help.  Move shd. be made in Winter, if at all.  We shan’t find alternative tenants until known tht. premises are vacant.



J.S.	Retrograde step in dev. and policy.  Will be so represented by Labour.



A.L.B.	I came to concln. tht. subject to verification of their figures, BEA had an un-answerable case.



A.E.	Cd. take wider view on natl. grounds – undue concentn. on Ldn.

	Balanced distn. of industry : incldg. targets in war.

	Fords, eg. are increasg. in Coventry in order to disperse from Dagenham.



P.M.       x	That wd. be argument for increased subsidy.



W.M.	Nos. aren’t large, but may be protests about redundancy because no local prospects of alternative emplt. – esp. as R. Royce are closing factory at Larkhall.  Doubtful if the 150 will move to Ldn.  And in Ldn., labour is short.  Cdn’t Minister wait at least until he has seen Sc. interests.



B.C.	I wdn’t announce decn. until after I had seen them.



A.L.B.	Dangerous to offer to recomp for consequences of Govt. policy – for e.g. we require them not to accept trooping contracts.



R.A.B.	We don’t subsidise moves to dev. areas.  A new departure.



D.S.	Wd. be regarded as reversal of our efforts to put aircraft industry into Scotland.  But we can’t force BEA to work un-economically.



B.C.	I can’t compel them in this.  But they did seek Govt. advice.



R.A.B.      y/	Ask M/S. for further advice on alternative firms.



P.M.        x/	W’draw argument at x/.  We cd. do no more 	than refrain from

criticising this element in operatg. loss.

	Report again in light of y/.

								[Exit B.C.



		3.	Pensions.



O.P.	Benefits will be up by more than 20% : contns. by less.  This helps with l/c increase.

	Increments – on deferred retirement.  Now 3/= a year, beyond 65.

	At higher benefits it shd. be 4/=.  I cd. then say no one wd. lose by deferring retirement.  This is only point on wh. I am not in agreemt. with RAB., who wants to leave it over until we have examd. Phillips.  This is largely political.  There is enough jam in our plan w’out it.  Might need it to sweeten some Phillips powder later.

	Will announce on Wed. next.



Sw.	Hope Phillips &amp; Act. can issue together.



O.P.	Was to have bn. 2 days’ delay.  I cd. defer Actuary’s Rpt.  I will do so – if R.A.B. agrees.  



R.A.B. 	I agree.



P.M.	Defer Tobacco token ques until later?



R.A.B.	Imposs. to administer.  Wd. like to deprive new entrants of it.



O.P.	Creates anamoly betwn. old people of difft. ages.  Money saving will be negligible.  Wd. take 15-20 years to die out.  Shall get political odium w’out financial advantage.  Wd. have preferred to reduce rates.



J.S.	Or abolish it altogether.



O.P.	Trouble then wd. be N. Ass. smokers, who wd. be up 2/6 and down 2/4.



P.M.	Approve main scheme &amp; leave this over?



R.A.B.	V. expensive scheme for future : a matter of £300 M.  Was right not to be precipitate. 

	We shall be only country in world giving subsistce. pension w’out means test.

	Big rise (7/6) – which shd. hold posn. for some time.

	Defer alteration in increments until later.   Agreed.

	When is decision needed on tobacco?



		Agreed :	Don’t do tobacco at this time.



							[Exit P.B.H.

		4.	Coloured Workers.



Ll.G.	Cttee. – to give support for action.  We need to reduce opposn. to our plan.

	Hope P.M. will see C.R.A. before this is announced.

	Fear it may take 4-6 months.



A.L.B.	Support plan for Cttee.  Need “independent” backing.



Sw.	Might get bi-partisan support thro’ a Cttee.



A.L.B.	Have a Cttee. soon &amp; hurry it up.



Sw.	Agree to all going to Cttee. (incldg. deportn.) because no room in p’mme for next Session even for Bill restricted to that.



P.M.	Take final decision when names are available.





		5.	Sale of Aircraft to Middle East.



P.M.	This is only ques of timing.



H.M.	V. complicated.  Issue about tanks too.  Also ships for Syria.

	We need a full picture of what we are doing in arms racket.

	Then we cd. take a more balanced decision.



R.A.B.	If we don’t sell, others will.  E.g. Sweden is ready to sell Vampires to Arabs.



H.M.	On telegram.  Don’t ask for recommns.  Shd. we not ask them merely for informn. on Mystères.

	Then get full picture.  And consider again in Def. Cttee.



A.E. 	H.M., S.Ll., and I (with de L.) can meet this p.m. &amp; bring up again at 10 p.m. mtg.
