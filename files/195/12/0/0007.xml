C. 19(54)							16th March, 1954



		1.	Royal Tour.				[Enter A.L.B., B.H.





P.M.

CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000





	Wd. like H.M. to have our advice, to use or not in her discretion.  Leave her free to ignore it if she wishes.

	Visit of 5 days, starting on 26/3.

	Advice already given by Sir Horace Evans.



Sw.	Sir G. McRobert thinks risk is slight. Less than flying.

	In U.K. we have had 8.000 notified in 1947 and nearly as many in 1951 and no restns. were placed on Royal activities.

	Greater risk is to children congregated in large crowds.

	Have sent tel. to Govr. of W. Austr., askg. for informn.



P.M.        x/	Will the tour, with restns. imposed, be worth-while?



Sw.	Restns. – our knowledge now is based on D. Express and other newspp.

	We have a duty to consider Queen’s health.  But x/ is essentially a matter for Australian Govt.



Sal.	Doubt if risk is v. great.  Easy to over-estimate.  100 cases in last month in whole of W. Austr. is not v. large.

	Agree x/ is doubtful.  We might say tht. if they advise her not to go on with it, we wd. sympathise with that view.



Sw.	The risk is v. small.  



CLOSED UNDER THE



FREEDOM OF INFORMATION



ACT 2000



Sw.	Send Tel. to Menzies : we are most anxious for Queen’s safety.  We shd. fully understand if you thght it necessary tht. visit to W.A. shd. be cancelled or that alterations shd. be made in plans e.g. that she shd. stay in Gothic vice Govt. House. 





		2.	Sudan.



P.M.	Tel. 103 from Khartoum.



A.E.	Am considering.  Don’t want U.N. brought in.  Will reply this p.m.

	This links with idea tht. Pakistan mght w’draw their Chairman of Commn. If he went at same time, Govr. Genl. wd. be supported.

	Much to be said for acting before Parly. decn. : but diff. to over-rule G. Genl. on that point.  Can put the other argument to him.

	Will submit answer to P.M. in draft.

							[Exit B.H.

 

		3.	Airways Corpns. : Use of Hermes Aircraft.



A.L.B.	Press reports are misleading. Inaccurate in most respects.

	Discn. by workers y’day on wtr they wd.  be asked to take Hermes out of cocoon.  They haven’t bn. asked yet.  And on Fri. there will be joint national discussions.

	BOAC have 19, bought 1950, wh. are now surplus.  Men have bn. led to believe they cd. be used for trooping.  In fact only 6 cd. be so used.  Our policy is tht. trooping shd. be given to independents.  Untrue the machines are being given away – sold at fair price.



P.M.	This (divn. of function betwn. Natd. and private airlines) is a matter for Parlt.  Industrial organisn. of T.U.’s must not be used to force pol. decisions or action contrary to those decisions.



ALB.	Mikardo is trying to do by industrial means what he has failed to secure by political methods.

	He has failed to raise it by P.N. Ques to-day.  Better tht. BOAC shd. handle it quietly, as they wish to do.



W.M.	Still at shop-level.  On Fri., at natl.  level, it will be handled by people who know diffce. betwn. industl.. and pol. matters.



	Shall give them hint tht. this is a Parly. matter.

	Wd. prefer tht. unions shd. turn this down themselves – tho’, if they don’t, we shall have to do it for them.



P.M.	So long as it is clear tht. T.U.’s may not over-rule, by industrial action, decisions properly taken by Parlt.
