C. 36(54)							26th May, 1954



		1.	Kenya.  Air Operations.		[Enter B-H., A.H., de L., 								 CAS. CIGS., S.Ll.

O.L.	As in memo.



CAS.	Air action is not good discriminatory weapon in these circs.  Has not bn. v. successful e.g. in Aden.  But with condn. tht. ground commander must be in close contact.  Also special pilots.  Then risk of damage to 3rd. parties is not large &amp; cd. be accepted.  Air Staff don’t like this in principle but are ready to accept it under these condns.



de L.	Not for harassing purposes : only when troops are in contact and gang is sufficiently large to offer a large target.



		Approved : no need for announcement.



							[Exit Serv. Min. &amp; C.O.S.

		2.	Togoland.



O.L.	As in memo.



		Approved.





		3.	Parliament.



H.C.	Recess to 15/6 : from 4/6.

	May be need for debate on Geneva for Recess : if so, wd. be on 3/6.





		4.	Expenses of Members.



R.A.B.	May I submit memo. for discn. next week, and decision.

	M’while invite views.



W.	Strong view in Party tht. we shd. deal with O.A.P. before Members’ salaries.

	I wd. therefore favour early legn., this summer, on O.A.P.



P.M.	That is a big affair : surely it shd. await Phillips Rpt.



R.A.B.	Large increase in stamp wd. be involved : cdn’t be done in a hurry.

	T.U.C. favour waiting until Phillips Rpt. is available.  Cttee. have now only to see Actuaries.  Pressing him for interim report.



W.	Can we at least have a statement of intention on OAP before we raise Members’ salaries.



RAB.	Political suicide to link these together.  V. little money in Members’ salaries.



P.M.	We invited decision of H/C.  We can’t defend delay in implementing it.

	Wd. cause v. bad feeling among Opposition.



B.H.	With majority of that size, we can’t delay action.

	We have delayed it for months since report submitted.

	Tiresome motion by Tories counselling delay.  Mover has already bn. told by Opposn. tht. he will never get another pair.



H.C.	Can’t delay beyond 30/6.



P.M.	Doubt if there will be serious trouble in country.

								[Enter O.P.



	If Parlt. runs into ’55 or ’56 there will be plenty of time to deal fully with OAP before Election.  Do this : &amp; say that, before we go to country, we shall have dealt with O.A.P. too.



H.M.	No need to decide it to-day.

	We have to decide how to implement clear wish of H/C. that posn. of Members be improved – wtr by method wh. Govt. &amp; most of our supporters preferred or by method preferred by Opposition. and Boothby-ites.

	Tho’ I agree tht. it must be one or other &amp; as soon as possible.



R.A.B.	Also i) need mtg. of trustees of Members’ Fund.  Do they need an Exchequer contn. : they have a balance of £70.000.

	ii) we must consider salaries of Junior Ministers – summer or autumn.  Wd. it be covered by same Supplementary?



J.S. 	It wd. need legn.  



P.M. 	It might be dated back.



Sal.	And what about the Peers?

	Allowance scheme cd. be applied to them, at proper time.  Salary increase could not.  This shd. be taken into account.



M.F.	Having raised salaries by 50% we can’t expect people to believe our propaganda on c/living.  No doubt of ill effects on other policies.



Sw.	Strong re-action on labour claims.



W.M.	From that angle wd. have preferred re-imbursement of expenses.

	It will be just one of many arguments used in support of wage claims.  Increased dividends (inevitable) will be another.  This will be an added inconvenience, tho’ not decisive.



O.L.	Can we carry Deedes’ method after the vote?



Sal.	Believe that this is the right method.

	I don’t accept view tht. H/C. is sole judge.  Can’t disregard public opinion outside.  Remember capital punishment.  Deedes’ method meets substance by the right method.



B.H.	Doubt if we cd. get it thro’ – even with Whips on.

								    [Exit B.H.



		5.	Pensions.



O.P.	Outlined an interim scheme had it been wanted.  But RAB and I wd. both prefer to wait until autumn &amp; take only one bite at cherry.

	But that makes it all the more necessary to get Phillips &amp; Actuaries Rpts. by November.  So that we may announce policy at Xmas &amp; get new rates in operation by summer of 1955.

	Thus, recommend no interim action.

	Last para. of memo.  Unemployable allowances shd. now be p’poned &amp; included in general scheme.



P.M.	When it is done, don’t let it be pettifogging. 



RAB.	   	i)	£72 M – rising to £150 M. = increased cost.  Will be met at first 		from Fund.  But in 1970 or so big deficits will begin : unless 		we correct that by increasing retiring age.

	  	ii)	Six months’ adminve. gap: this is inevitable.  Awkward delay.

	 	iii)	Must press Phillips for earliest possible report this autumn.



J.S.	Unemployable allowances.  Is it fair to defer until summer of ’55?



O.P.	I am at RAB.’s disposal on this.  Better prs. to m’tain general freeze until we are ready to move on main issue.



RAB.	I’m not against doing it earlier, if desired.



Sw.	Wd. provoke pressure for general improvemt.



P.M.	Cd. do it once we have let it be known tht. we plan to deal generally with pensions next year.



H.C.	Not before early autumn.  Wd. be linked with Members’ Expenses.



RAB.	Summer (before recess) or autumn.  Will submit a recommn.



H.C.	This (OAP.) will exclude all other “Social” legn. next Session.



O.P.	My present intentn. is a Bill dealing with little but rates &amp; contns.

	Won’t occupy much time.

								[Exit O.P.



		

		6.	Sugar.



H.G.	V. easy industry to nationalise.  Natn. wd. end sugar market in Ldn.

	Important therefore to end the control.

	This plan will provoke some criticism.  But alternative is natn.

	Trade have privately indicated tht. they will accept this.

	Unless we do this, a M/F. will have to continue running sugar trade until 1956.





		7.	European Iron &amp; Coal Community.	[Enter D.S., G.Ll., A.L.B.



Sw.	Agreed we can’t offer common market – all our industries are against it.  They will, under pressure, accept ½ way-house.

	Only way of overcomg. their suspicions is to bring them into direct touch with Community &amp; continental producers – hence plan for Council of Assocn.



D.S.	Support this plan. Steel Bd., qua commercial interests, want neither common market nor tariff redns.  But they see pol. consns. involved.  We must carry them with us.  Cdn’t stand risk of severe competn. or dumping.  If we brght industry into touch, thro’ Assocn., with Continental producers they wd. probly. come along twds a ½ way-house – given safeguards on dumping.

	Anyhow, they wd. welcome machinery for continuing consultn.

	Can’t get them to accept principles etc., on tariffs as pre-condn. to Assocn.

	Believe we can persuade Monnet tht. this is a typically Br. approach.

               x/	Cttee. cd. remain in being during talks with Monnet.



S.Ll.	A.E. wd. welcome x/.  And wd. like Sw. to conduct the talks with Monnet.



Sw.	Talks will get at once into detail.  Wd. prefer tht. D.S. shd. handle them from outset.



P.T.	Don’t differ greatly.  But on timing – when &amp; where do we negotiate redn. in steel tariff.  I wd. sooner do it before we associate.

	If we associate first, we shd. be throwing that card away before we began discussing tariffs.



S.Ll.	Monnet won’t come here until 2nd. wk. of July.  Shd. Weir begin to warn him tht. we shan’t give all he hopes.



R.A.B.	[Don’t expect M. will be disappointed.]

	Believe we shall have to discuss tariff etc., first.



P.M.	Let D.S. take charge from now on – calling Weir into consultn.

	Cttee. shd. remain in being.

	Sw. can lunch Monnet.

								[Exit D.S.

		8.	Civil Defence Plans.



M.F.	Draft statement approved by C.D. Cttee.

	Para. 4 appd. by scientists in A.E. Dept.



Al.	Suggd. amendment of para. 2.

	Para. 3 figures based on St. Cole’s statement. Shd. be made clear.

	Para. 3 final sentence cd. be strengthened on basis of L.P.S. statement at Skegness.

	Wd. prefer to see statement made more robust, generally.



		Approved, subject to discn. on detail with Alex.



H.C.	In what form?  V. long for oral statement in H/C.



M.F.	Not on a Friday – when v. little other business.



H.C.	Make a short statement &amp; circulate full version in Hansard.



M.F.	Will make arrangemts. with H.C.





		9.	Apostolic Delegate in U.K.



P.M.	U.S. citizen of Irish race.

	2.8 m R.C.’s in E. &amp; Wales and about same no. in Eire.



S.Ll.	A man of exceptional quality, who has shown great friendship twds Br. Commonwealth.  But, admittedly, not a Br. s.

	We have conveyed to Vatican our preference for a Br. s. but without success.



Sw.	He behaved excellently in Dublin.



		Agreed :  no objection.





		10.	Fuel Policy.



R.A.B.	Can we have discussions on i)  Marchwood.

				        ii)   a diffft. method for briquettes.



H.M.	I shd. be consulted on Marchwood because of pollution in So’ton.

	Think D.S.I.R. shd. be brought in.









		11.	Pakistan.



Sw.	Warned Cab. of facts in Tel. 709.
