C. 44(54)							29th June, 1954



		1.	Washington Talks : Anglo_U.S. Declaration.  [Enter S.Ll., B.H.



S.Ll.	Para. 3 “we will earnestly strive …” i.e. omit reference to self-determinn.

	Even in U.N. Charter there was case to avoid reference to a right of s-d.

	Para. 5.  Last sentence : “citizens” reads oddly.  Prefer to omit it.



O.L.	Support S.Ll.’s first point.  This wd. give separatist movements in Colonies a peg on wh. to hang their demands.  – cf. B. Honduras.



Sal.	Agree.  S-determination, invented by Prs. Wilson, hung like a mill-stone round our necks betwn. wars.

	Personally, I dislike whole of 1st. sentence.  Who is to be the judge.  We and U.S. mght take a v. diff. views.



O.L.	“Capable of sustaining self-govt” gives us the discretion where Colonies are concerned.  Can stomach this wording.



H.M.	Third sentence of para. 3 is v. strong in relation to satellites.



RAB.	Para. 1.  delete “in so far as they are still applicable”.  Stop at “Charter”.



Sal.	Ask P.M. to recognise implication of rest of 1st. sentence of para 3. for B. Emp.



		

		2.	Parliament : Members Expenses.



R.A.B.	Suggd. reply to CRA’s lr.  Main point, invite him to meet us to explain “full significance of your lr.”



H.M.	You must rebut his “precondition” of an increase in salary.



Sal.	“re-affirm” vice “nothing to add to” P.M.’s statement.  Agreed.



L.P.S.	Continue : but it is not quite clear fr. yr. lr wtr you accept that position.



M.F.	Don’t slam the door.  He may be given more rope.



R.A.B.	Invite him to talk to explain “full significance” of his lr.  Agreed.





		







		3.	Noise at Airfields.			[Enter D.S., ALB., de. L., 

								   Att. G



D.S.	Explained earlier history leading to making of Regns. as soon as threatened action at Dunsfold had bn. settled out of court.

	These Regns. give power to M/T. to impose condns. &amp; thus to move towards a redn. of noise.

	Somethg. had to be done to prevent stoppage of aircraft m’fre.



A.L.B.	Agree there was no alternative.  Must promise to make it obligatory to muffle noise, as soon as technically possible.



O.L.	Engines on bench under test can be silenced by baffle.

	Trouble arises when engine is embodied in aircraft.  Can’t then be muffled.



A.L.B.	Portable mufflers are coming in : for use in airports.



Att.G.	C.Av. Act ’49 : sections 40/41 were v. drastic.  Abolished right of civil action where Regns. were made.  Removed a fundamental right.



		Memo. approved.			[Exit M.F.

							[Exit D.S., de.L., 

							[Enter Home. G.Ll.

		4.	Reorganisation of Railways.



ALB.	Scheme has attracted unexpectedly wide measure of support.



Sal.	H.A. Cttee. thght this a good scheme.

	Brought to Cab. mainly because wish of M/T. to get Parly. approval before recess.



W.M.	Support scheme.  Inevitable tht. T.U.C. shd. oppose it.

	Also agree tht. direct T.U. repn. on area boards shd. not be allowed.



Home	Support scheme.  Want it appd. by Parlt. before Recess.



A.L.B.	We undertook to present W. Paper for debate : then review it in light of comment : then seek Parly. approval.  Now seems likely tht. 2nd. submission will be formal.  More trouble if I delay publn. or publish &amp; delay approval.



RAB.	Wd. like to know more of functions of Co-ordinating Cttee. for Scotland.

	Pl. submit memo.



L.P.S.	Bound to take 2 days – because related to de-nationalisation.  No room for it w’out interfering with some other business.  This is big politics but, if it is to go fwd., what will Cabinet drop, i.e. what legn. will be sacrificed or p’poned until autumn spill-over.  Or sit in first week of Aug.



R.A.B.	Let L.P.S. indicate on Thursday what consequences wd. be, on legve. p’mme.





		5.	Nationalised Industries : Select Committee.	[Exit Home



L.P.S.	Opposn. was based partly on fear tht. Cttee. wd. go into wages ques.

	Have made it clear tht. this will not be so. 

No support in H/L. for a Joint Cttee.  Dropping that will reduce some of the criticism.

	Wdn’t. be set up until next Session.  Needn’t be announced for 2 wks.



O.L.	Wages &amp; working condns.?  Bottom of p. 2.  T. preference.



W.M.	Wages &amp; condns. of service.



L.P.S.	Will put in whatever words M/L. desire.

	No power to appoint Sub-Cttees.



		Approved.



							[Exit G.Ll.

		6.	B.B.C. Fortnight Rule.



L.P.S.	As in memo. Power of direction was not designed for this sort of thing.

	Must get Opposn. agreemt. in writing to issue of a direction.  If they don’t assent, Cab. may have to consider it again.



		Agreed :	L.P.S. to consult CRA.

				Authorised to give direction if CRA agrees.
