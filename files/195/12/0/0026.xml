C. 37(54)							2nd June, 1954



		1.	Parliament.				[Enter S.Ll., B.H., de. L.



H.C.	Business for week after Recess.

	One day on Finance Bill may have to be given over to F. Affairs debate.





		2.	Economic Affairs.



R.A.B.	Over 165 M. – gold &amp; dollar plus for the month.

	Brings us near the total of £3.000 M.  And less defence aid.

	Conversion loan : success reflects good credit.



							

							            [Enter C.A.S.

		3.	Iraq : Defence Arrangements.			[Exit B.H.



Al.	Treaty expires ’57.  Accept fact tht. we cdn’t get agreemt. of same kind.  But our essential strategic needs wd. be met by agreemt. on lines suggd. in memo.  Front is now much further N.E.  R. unlikely to be able to put big thrust thro’ Caucasus.  Good chance of holding what they cd. afford to put in if we can have Iraq co-opn. in peace and use of their airfields in war.



P.M.	Accept their ownership, but we must have unquestioned power to use, these air bases.



S.Ll.	If we don’t offer formally to hand over ownership, we shall end in deadlock &amp; ruin our friends in Iraq.  But if we do make that offer, we have a good chance of securing facilities we need.

	Elections 9/6.  All we propose now is to give Crown Prince an indication of our views &amp; intentions – so tht. he may seek to get a Govt, who cd. negotiate on this in the autumn.



de L.	Adminve. problem.  If we re-deploy fr. E., we intend to station 3 or 4 squadrons in Iraq.  V. important base.  Cd. house 4.000.  To re-arrange that wd. be complicated &amp; expensive.  We shd. be slow to offer its surrender.



R.A.B.	Mil. talks won’t start until Nov.  Wdn’t. it be better to wait until we have done our defence review.



S.Ll.	We need only say : we are considering &amp; if we get satisf. assurances on use we shall prob. be ready to hand over ownership.



Sal.	Iraq is diffnt. fr. E. : for we have friends there &amp; shdn’t weaken their position.

	But shd. we not have a recommn. from C.O.S.?



C.A.S.	Defence of Iraq is altering because of h. bomb.  Looks as tho’ we cd. now stop R. on a forward line.  Habbaniyab becomes more important.  We now have a chance of taking positive line with Iraqis.

	Importance of having a new agreement.  But we wd. prefer to have the military talks first.



P.M.        x|	Let us have C.O.S. view in writing.

	|	Also F.O. formula of what is actually to be said to Regent.



Sw.	Shall have to consider what we then say to Doms. – old Doms and also Pakistan.  Probly. wise to tell India too.  Will discuss this with F.O.



S.Ll.	Not until after we have had Regent’s re-action.



		Agreed – as at x/.



							            [Exit de L., CAS.

		4.	Crichel Down.					[Enter Att. G.



		a)	Long-term Policy.



M.F.	Explained proposals on future policy.

	Majority of Cttee. favour giving former owner chance to buy back on same method as was followed on requisition.  Ty. posn. reserved : 

	Ld. Chanc. dissents.



T.D.	Future of Crichel Down.  Can’t hand it back.

	Marten’s costs.

	Publn. of report.  H/C. promised it before Whitsun.  Cttee. prefer to p’pone until day after recess, when debate can follow at once.

	Report to be accompanied by short statement – as in Annex.



Sim.	I am alone in the view tht. rights of pre-emption shd. be created on an adminve. basis when it isn’t practicable legally.

	Crichel Down itself shows diffies.  M/Ag. decided tht. public interest requires it to be farmed as a unit : this promise of pre-emption wd negative that.



P.M.	Public interest must sometimes bow to private claims.



Sim.	But on adminve. basis it wd. be capricious &amp; arbitrary.



P.M.	Party wd. support majority view on Cttee.



Sim.	I don’t press my view.



R.A.B.	We shall be trying to do, by statement in H/C. what Parlt. has h’to failed to do in legn.  Surely the annex of exceptions is a mistake.  Let us at least avoid this detail.

	“Former owner &amp; his successors”.  Does that mean successors in title, or heirs?

	Valuation by D. Valuer.  Prefer to notify &amp; then sell at auction.



Sal.	Agree tht. we cd. not give statutory right of pre-emption. But that is not proposed.  All we suggest is tht., save in exceptional cases, owner shall have a chance of buying at price fixed by Valuer.  Ty. think Valuers’ price might not be highest obtainable.  But his price is relied on when State acquires.  Ty. can’t have it both ways.  At auction owner may not have a fair chance : for Govt. may prefer to put it up in smaller parcels to get higher prices.



R.A.B.	Defer to Sal’s view – but put it more generally.



H.M.	Support that course.



	Agreed : Revised version of statement on long-term policy to be submitted to Cabinet.



		b)	Clark’s Report.



T.D.	May I now promise publn. immediately after recess &amp; foreshadow a debate “as soon as convenient” thereafter.



T.D.	Proposed amendments in paras. on Civil Servants’ mistakes.

	Wish to state my confidence in Agric. Land Commn.



Sal.	Can you – when they have made such a mistake.  Say instead tht. they still serve a useful purpose.



M.F.	Useful tactically – because of Labour views.



		Agreed :  Adopt Sal’s formula.



T.D.	Tozer.  We can’t get him out unless he will go – &amp; he won’t.



M.F.	Not practicable to return the land to Marten.  We shd. prob. have to pay T. £10,000 to get out :  &amp; how cd. we justify that?



J.S.	Shd. we not at least ask T. if he will get out?



		Agreed : can’t get T. out.  



Att. G.  	Better say it, in statement.



T.D.	Costs.  I wd. prefer tht. we shd. pay the costs.



Sim.	Dangerous precedent.



P.M.	Were they warned tht. there was no provn. for costs?  If so, they had better lump it.



H.M.	See how it goes in debate?



M.F.	My instinct was to pay the costs.  Marten was right in pressing for enquiry &amp; public interest has bn. served by it.  Public opinion wd. think it generous.



		Agreed :  Pay his costs.





		5.	Tarrant Rushton.



P.M.	Position shd. be reviewed at once by Ministers concerned.



	As in my brief.





		6.	Fuel Policy.					[Exit Att. G.

								            [Enter G.Ll.



G.Ll.	Marchwood.  Oil prices are so low that B.E.A. think it commercially acceptable.  They are also warming twds. oil burning elsewhere.

	This, in turn, has made it easier to do briquetting at a commercial price.

	Shan’t therefore have to issue any directions to either Bd.

	B.E.A. will now consider dual-firing at power stations in estuaries.

	All this helps me to be more reasonable over open-cast.

	Ready now to forego 2 m. tons over 3 years.  W’in that time I will not raise Nook of Fife.



	Man Power.  Need is regional, not general.  S Yorks. &amp; Midlands when mines have to compete with other flourishing industries.

	NCB. are launching recruitg. campaign on basis of special houses.



RAB.	Now accept principle of oil in competn. with coal.
