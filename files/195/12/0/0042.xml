C. 53(54)							26th July, 1954





									[Enter BH.

		1.	China : Attack on British Aircraft.		



A.E.	Ch. have apologised &amp; offered to pay compn.  Say they mistook it for a Chiang aircraft.  Probly. true.





		2.	Washington : Visit to M. Malenkov.



P.M.	Soviet note is a new event.  Their proposal for 32 Power conference.

	Relevant because clear, fr. concldg. paras, despatch was decided after end of Geneva Confce.

	A.E. has [preliminary] alternative draft answer to Sov. note of 5/7.

	Note is designed to stop E.D.C.

	Drafts prepared by AE &amp; P.M. read to Cab.

	Must be made clear tht. my proposal is in abeyance m’while.

	Don’t regret my approach – was consistent with what I have said in public.

	Suggest Cab. approve in principle – AE &amp; P.M. to settle drafting.

	

A.E.	Will put us in strong posn. vis-á-vis Russia.

	Sov. note is intended to cause diffies. in G. &amp; France – and prob. will.

	If we don’t get G. anchored to west, we shall lose them.



Sal.	Happy to assent to the answer proposed.

	This is new sitn.  If Soviet note fails, another new situation.



H.C.	Why mention places.  



A.E. 	To make it clear we won’t go to Moscow.





		3.	Atomic Weapons Programme.



Sal.	Outlined nature of p’mme, and implications (staff).

	Extra materials - thorium, tritium, heavy water.  Steps taken to get them : but we cd. sell to U.S. if decided not to go fwd.

	Possession of up to date nuclear weapons is essential to position of a great Power.



H.M.	Agree we shd. go ahead.  Shd. consider what line to take in public.



L.P.S.	V. reluctantly, I agree.  I’m not wholly persuaded.









		4.	Egypt : Defence Negotiations.



H.C.	Two or three opporties. for the rebels to raise debate : e.g. Friday with spker’s permn. or Thurs.  Pressure for earlier re-assembly is prs. most likely.



B.H.	Opposn. may now ask for E Affairs on Thurs., vice Disarmament.



A.E.	Promise made at Xmas time.  Opportunity to debate heads – but said I cdn’t undertake not to go on m’while with prepn. of Treaty.

	It is w’in power of Executive normally to sign a Treaty : I am therefore makg. a concession in saying tht. I won’t conclude Treaty before debate.

	Only alternative is to offer to recall Parlt. to discuss “heads”.

	If by any chance A.H. concluded agreemt. on heads by Wed. p.m., it wd. be possible to debate them on Friday.



A.E.	Read Cairo tel. 864.

	Support A.H.’s view.  Improved Cl. 8 wd. be better than longer duration.



P.M.	18 months fr. signature of Treaty mght look better than 20 fr. heads



A.E.	(Verified) period runs from Treaty.



P.M.	Make it clear to H/C. tht. offer of debate on heads in no way affects liberty of HMG. to move troops as in their judgmt. circs. require.



A.E.	We must retain freedom to move.



R.A.B.	Again whined about civil contractors.  Is it too late to go back to military technicians.



O.L.	Depends on the man you get to run it.



R.A.B.	Can W.O. be required to keep cost down.



								[Enter Birch.

		5.	Cyprus.					[Exit B.H.



O.L.	P. 6 ques. put to C.O.S., whose answer is tht. it is militarily necessary tht. Cyprus shd. remain w’in Br. sovereignty.

	Memo. therefore starts fr. posn. tht. we can’t discuss sovereignty.

	What then shd. we do?  Limited constitutional advance (para. 14) in place of the much more liberal constitution offered in 1948.

	They may refuse.  Then we carry on with nominated members, but with advantage tht. we have made the offer.



P.M.	Shd. we consider wtr Gk. flag shd. fly with British.



O.L.	How wd. Turks re-act to that?  Anyway, no historical basis.  Hasn’t bn Greek in 3,000 yrs.



A.E.	Serious situation qua Greece.  This is 1st. time a Gk. Govt. has taken this up.  V. ungrateful – as we got them Dodecanese.

	Belive not much Press &amp; radio for our pt. of view.  Much we cd. say as cpd. with Gk. regime.  When this comes out, a vigorous propaganda drive wd. be worth doing.

	U.S. won’t want to embarrass us – they will try to help.



O.L.	Statement.  Annex 3.  Para. 2.  Shd. words in [  ]  be kept in?



A.E.	Final sentence is open to doubt.  Opens a flank.  It’s not our only reason.  Main case is it’s Br. property.



		Approved : 	O.L. &amp; A.E. to settle text of announcement.



Sw.	Firm decln. re sovereignty wd. be better qua carrying India in U.N.

	Doms. to be informed in advance.



							[Exit Birch

		6.	Television Authority.			[Enter P.M.G.



P.M.	Lord S. wd. not be good Chairman.  No experience – has bn. abroad for years.



P.M.G.	Re-assuring because M/Edn. experience.  Tory apptd. to Ceylon by Labour.

	Tact rather than drive is needed. 



P.M.	Hudson wdn’t do it.  Law wd. hardly do.  Elliot wd. be effective &amp; has advantage of friendship with Jacob.  Believe he wd. like it. Has bn. in U.S. for some years.  Probly. acceptable to Labour.



W.	This body must attract commercial confidence.  Will need to raise £3M. or so.  Chairman must be known for competence, rather than politics.  Also composn. shd. be reviewed from this pt. of view.



P.M.G.	Cd. it be agreed tht. Soulbury be apptd. if Elliot declines?



Sw.	Remainder of Bd. must be strengthened.  Their problem will be to get people to go into this.  This will turn on having business-like Board.



PMG.	Sir Charles Colston wd. be welcome, in place of Ch. Accountant.



R.A.B.	Want an accountant.  Berry or Hutton.



W.	Suggest Ld. Derby.  



PMG. 	Better as chairman of one of the Companies.

	Also he has bn. prominent in the controversy.



W.	Why not have on this Bd. some people who believe in it.  Who on this list is going to put the drive behind it?



F.H.	Not Hardman – he wd. not enhance reputn. of Bd.



W.	Colston vice accountant.  



RAB. 	Yes : if firm of accountants can be apptd. as advisers to Bd.



		Agreed :	P.M.G. to ask Elliot.

				List of members as amended in discn.
