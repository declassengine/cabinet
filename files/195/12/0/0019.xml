C. 30(54)							28th April, 1954



		1.	Colombo Meeting.		[Enter S.Ll.,  B-H., J. B.C.



Sw.	Tel. 25 from Geneva:  draft of A.E.’s message to P.M.’s of I., P. &amp; Ceylon.

	Favour this.  Urgent.  Will strengthen hands of P.M.’s of C. &amp; P.



		Agreed : authorise immediate despatch.





		2.	Parliament.



H.C.	Address of welcome on Queen’s return.  Monday after her return 17/5.  To be moved by leaders of the three Parties.  Ch. Whip to arrange with authies. wtr part of roadway be available to M.P.’s on 15/5.

	Home Sec. to consider, with Ld. Ch., wtr Queen’s route shd. be round Parlt. Square.



	Business for next week.



	Two days for decision : Tues or Wedy.  Either Cttee. of Television Bill or Members’ Expenses.  Opposn. have declared intentn. to fight the T. Bill.  Shd. we have a time-table?  Is this a Bill for that?  What effect wd. it have on H/Lds?



Sw.	H/L. wdn’t object to time-table as such – only concerned wtr clauses had bn. considered.



B.H.	V. large no. of amendmts.  Some of ours wd. have to come off, if we were to get it w’out time table.



M.F.	Then our amendmts. will be w’drawn and all time will be spent on Oppn. amendmts.  Better to have time-table – wd. give greater impn. tht. Bill has general support.



P.M.	Quite suitable for time-table.



B.H.	Some believe it’s a matter of conscience.



P.M.	You wdn’t admit that when I wanted a free vote.



H.M.	Must have time-table or drop Bill.



H.C.	We are drifting into posn. of time-tabling nearly everything – which is against our principles.  We shan’t like it when in Opposn.

	Remember there is no gt. interest in this except in H/C.



P.M.	I regret tht. we have gone so far with this : but it wd. be humiliating to drop it now.

		Agreed :	Impose time-table.



H.C.	Wd. prefer to wait until it is obviously necessary.  Run it for 2 days w’out time-table.	

				Agreed.



		3.	Indo.China.



P.M.	Held a mtg. of as many as were immediately available on Sunday.

	A.E.’s plan was plainly right.

	Seems poss. U.S. may come round to our view, without a row.

	Further appeal y’day from Laniel via Massigli.  I rejected that.



	C.O.S. remain of opinion tht. strike wd. be ineffective, despite views of Fr. staff officer brght over by Massigli.

								[Enter H.H., J.T.





		5.	Gibraltar : Pay of Industrial Workers.



P.M.	A.E. is concerned at this.  Causes much ill-feeling in Spain.

	Difference in c/living has decreased.

	Tho’ no diffy. in getting Sp. labour at lower rates.



Al.	Costs £150,000.  And will come off Def. Vote.

	Feel no gt. sympathy with Sp. workers – they only come because they prefer it to work available in Gib.  Favour sending out commn. to see how we cd. reduce nos. employed – if not cut it out altogether.



H.H.	Gib. Govt., who also employ, want to reduce differential – can’t resist views of T.U.’s much longer.



W.M.	Private employers pay same rates.

	We pay to Sp. residents the lower rates : &amp; the higher rates to B. subjects resident in Spain.  Thus, we discriminate on citizenship basis.



J.T.	We wd. pay same rate to those resident in Gib ; but C.O. object to that.



J.B.C.	Raise by 9/= so as to reflect real difference in c/living.



H.H.	That assumes v. canny buying – on both sides.



W.M.	Differential shd. at least be related to residence.



J.T.	Serv. Dpts. wd. accept that.



Al.	Make good extra cost by employing fewer Spaniards.



JBC.	High rate of living in Gib. is due in part to artificial rate of exchange fixed for goods sent in fr. Spain to Gib.

Sw.      x|	This gives Franco good justificnn. for ordering no Spaniard to work in Gib. if he wished to do so.



P.M.	Timing.  On reflection, I think it better not to involve Queen in this.

	Read note by Admiralty.



H.H.	Effect will be worse if there is agitation while Queen is there and we have to give way afterwards.



JB.C.	But no current wage dispute.



	1.	P.M.	No announcement before Queen’s visit.

		S.Ll. 	What of x/.

		P.M.	Spaniards won’t like it.  We can bear it – Maltese &amp;			Mauritians are available &amp; load of dockyard work can 		be adjusted.



	2.	P.M.	Cttee. shd. be apptd. and announced after visit to 			consider wtr compromise in para. 4 wd. do.

			J.T.’s memo. to be circulated to Cab. &amp; sent to A.E.

			Form of enquiry to be subject of recommn. by M/L.



							[Exit H.H., J.T.

		6.	Teachers’ Superannuation Bill.		[Enter I.McL.



F.H.	Most other schemes involve 6% contn.

	But teachers’ real point is tht. their pensions shd. never be made contriby.

	I told them in 1952 tht. the rate wd. have to be raised.

	When Bill was introduced teachers had no hope of defeating it.  They have taken heart at Tory revolt.



	The 2 points are :-	i)  all contrib. schemes will be threatened.

				ii) can’t find economies if we don’t do this.

	On both counts this is a test case.

	I have put this to Educn. Cttee. of Party.  Large majority agreed.

	RAB has since done so.  Many Members have defended our posn.

	Those who dissent are neither senior nor respected members of Party.

	Believe I cd. win some of them over if I saw them separately.

	Mass mtgs. do nothg. but provide an audience for Boothby.

	Want it in week after next.  R.A.B. will wind up.



J.S.	I have 11/80ths. of this trouble.  It is wholly justified.  Have defended it for months.  We ought to push it through.



F.H.	Burnham Cttee., when salaries were last raised, knew tht. this was coming.  But they said it wd. be wrong to increase salaries for purpose of enabling them to make higher contn. to pensions.

	Salary was therefore negotiated separately.



H.C.	This dates fr. economies we imposed when we first took office.

	If we give it up now, how can we expect another £100M. economies.

	We shd. have to abandon all hope of cutting anything wh. hurts.



F.H.	And P.A.C. have twice said tht. this shd. be rectified w’out delay.



H.C.	No ques of merits.  Only ques is wtr we can carry the Bill.



H.M.	Agree.  We have reached that point now.

	If we can carry it, we shall gain in prestige.

	If we w’draw it, we admit that 6 or 8 dissidents can prevent anything.



B.H.	Discontented but willing = 15.

	Unreliable = 19 to 23, or wh. 8 are certain to abstain. &amp; 1 of them will vote against.



	Absence thro’ sickness etc., before Recess = 22.

	Liberals will vote against it.



P.M.	Well : I think we had better ram it thro’.

	If defeated, we will defer to view of H/C. but not resign.  		Invite vote of confidence, if desired.



								[Enter O.P.

		7.	Occupational Health Scheme.		[Exit B.H.  Alex. S.Ll.



W.M.	T.U.C. mentioned this at deputn. to P.M.  They have bn. pressing it for some time.  Labour wd. do it in grandiose way.  I want to make modest start – empirical approach via 2 Cttees.  as in memo.

	J.S. doubts its scope: presume he wd. exclude non-industrials, but that wd. exclude about 50% of employed.  I.McL. wants enquiry.

	We don’t need that – have had several abortive attempts.

	Dpl. responsibility.  I suggd. M/L., who now have Factory Dpt.

	Recognise, however, tht. this might prejudge decn. &amp; I wd. accept neutral Minister as Chairman.  Want official Cttee. as well.

	BMA, as well as T.U.C., will m’tain pressure.



P.M.	Views of B/T.



W.M.	Need not be expressive.  Depends what policies emerge.



J.B.C.	Purpose wd. presumably be to expand this service?



W.M.	Moderate addl. cost on industry.



JBC.	Paid out of taxation.

	Is this the right time to branch out on this?



M.F.	Para. 11(1) and (2).  Esp. (ii).  I have received many deputns.

	My proposals on Gowers are now coming to Cabinet.

	If they are turned down, how will M/L. co-ordinate?



W.M.	Consultns. on rlways &amp; agric. were, in Jan., hanging fire.



I.McL.	Support P.T.’s point (2)

	But my own view is tht. we don’t need this new machinery.

	I want to determine type &amp; means of services needed.  That (not Dpl. responsibility) has not bn. explored before.

	We shd. know where we are going before we announce a new step.

	Any Cttee. shd. have Chairman independent of all Dpts. concerned.



W.	These services do improve productivity.

	Even so, I doubt if this is moment for another fwd. step.

	N.H.S. isn’t out of wood.  Doctors are over-worked.

	This wd. call into being a corps of doctors who wd. not be attending patients.  Gt. call on medical man-power.

	Suggest small Cttee. of Ministers to consider whole project.



Sw.	Economy.  Can’t hope to get £100 M. w’out cuts that hurt.

	This, in long term, wd. certainly involve added expend’re.

	It shd. be taken into a/c in that connn.



P.M.	Is this a good time to go forward?

	Is it in harmony with economy plans?

	Surely not.

	Also, is it wise to raise a lot of hopes (major policy etc.,) when our aim this year is to cut back cost of Welfare State.

	If we have no real intentn. or hope of making progress soon, wd. it be wise to raise such hopes?  -  by appointing a public Cttee.

	Surely we have enough trouble on our hands already.

	Prefer to examine this when there is a real intention to act.



M.F.	Gowers Rpt. ques will come up next week.

	May we take final decision then, when we have discussed those pp.

	If we decide to do nothing, M/L. &amp; Iwill have to handle T.U.’s v. carefully.

	Theme of our last year is v. important &amp; shd. be considered as a whole.



P.M.	Yes – next week : on report of F. Legn. Cttee.
