C. 20(54)							17th March, 1954



		1.	Parliament.					[Enter B.H.



H.C.	Mon.  Opposn. may request debate for E/W. Trade.

	Tues.  Judges’ Bill.

	Thurs. Television Bill.  Speakers : M-F. to open : Gammans to reply to debate.



P.M.	Shall see Executive of 1922 this pm.  Will elicit their views on M.P.’s expenses.



A.H.	Waterhouse group want A.H. to address them.



P.M.	No.  Problem is political rather than military.



J.S.	Cd. he not go and listen?  



M-F. 	Agree with that.



H.C.	Better keep him out of this.



Al.	They won’t  understand true mil. implications.



B.H.	Might leak to Press.  A.H. wd. have to be careful what he said.



J.S.	They are getting worried re effects of their attitude.  Mght help to know what they are thinking.



P.M.	Let A.H. go, with H.C.  “It wd. be rather good for you to have a look at them”.





		2.	Gold Market.					[Exit B.H.



R.A.B.	i)  Will be announced at wk-end tht. Ldn. gold market will re-open 22/3.

	Discussed with C. Fin. Min in Sydney.  Welcomed by them.

	Doesn’t pre-judge convertibility.

	Belgians are going to do same.  Glad we shan’t be behind them.

	U.S. have now agreed.

	ii)  Transferable sterling now quoted at difft. rates.  Propose now to unify all forms.  One rate will make trading easier.



							           [Enter de L.

		3.	Scampton Airfield.



P.M.	Brought to my notice by L.P.S.  Involves cutting 2 miles of Ermine St., wh. has bn. preserved for 2.000 years.



L.P.S.	Avow constituency interest.  But wider interest because i) Ermine St. ii) Lincoln – both noise &amp; risk.  All other bomber airfields are much further from towns.  Even at addl. expense, another airfield cd. be developed in substitution.



de L.	Lincoln is not alone in this.  Stanford and Doncaster are in like case.

	These 2 have bn. there, nr. Lincoln, since 1934.

	Not Gt. N. Rd. – a less important road.  M/T. doesn’t dissent.

	These extensions can’t be made w’out interference with roads or amenities.

	Limitns. :	must be near pipeline &amp; bomb. bases.

			must not be w’in 30 miles of coast.

			economy : cheaper to develop existg. airfields.

			agric. land : this uses least possible.

	Disturbances.	Airfield are now in use.  Last war’s bombers made even more noise – because more numerous &amp; lower.  Routes will not impinge on Lincoln.



H.M.	Regular procedure – involvg. consultn. with Dpts. and l.a.’s.  Whatever Cab. decide, we shd. follow that.



de L.	No intention to try to avoid that.



R.A.B.	The alternative will cost nearly double.  Another £2M.



T.D.	Also this is less inconvenient for agricultural land.



P.M.	Let the usual procedure be followed.

		And why does it cost so much?

		Let Cab. take final decision.





		4.	Industrial Organisation &amp; Development Bill.



P.T.	As in memo.



H.C.	So long as P.T. will say it, in answer to P.Q.  Not enough for me to fob it off continually.



Sal.	If industry wanted scheme, why shdn’t they work it by vol. levy?



P.T.	They don’t really want it now.  And cdn’t work it by compulsion.



R.A.B.	Clear it up definitely as soon as possible.





		5.	Sexual Offences.



M.F.	Re-stated his case, as before.

	Both are serious social problems.  But we can’t legislate at present.

	Good reason to have R. Commn.

	They cd. (in reply to P.M.) do enquiry w’out publicity if they so decided.



Sw.	What of legn. restricting reports?  Cd. we try that?



M.F.	Genl. principles   i) adminn. of crim. justice shd. be done in public

			    ii) publicity attracts fresh evidence.

	Shall I submit memo on a) composn. and t. of r. of a R.C.     ]   x

				   b) merits of legn. proposal.               ]



Sw.	b) cd. have a run in H/Lords?



H.C.	Wdn’t get a run in H/C. unless Govt. adopted it.  We mightn’t wish to do so.



Sal.	Wd. also look bad to introduce in H/L. soon after Montagu case!



P.M.	Agree – H/C. wd. be proper forum for such a discussion.



H.C.	How many R. Commn’s have we now sitting?  We shd. know that.



Sal.	Somethg. shd. be done.  Nothg. can be done w’out R. Commn.

	This is surely a strong case for enquiry on this occasion.



P.M.	Limited legn. is only prudent course to take.



H.M.	Will arouse criticism tht. you are merely trying to hush it up.

	Timing would have to be considered.



F.H. &amp; W.	Wd. lose women’s vote if you tried to raise penalties for prostitutn. w’out backing of a R. Commn.



H.M.	Beware of removing deterrent of publicity.



M.F.   	Will put in memo. on (b).



Sal.	Case for enquiry into prostitution is unanswerable.

	Doubt re homosexuality – if only because remedy is less obvious.



F.H.	Prostitution alone wd. be represented as undue concentn. on women.



P.M.	More Police?						[Enter A.E.



		1)  M.F. to put in memo. on (b)

		2)  Resume discussion on proposal for R. Commn.









6.	Leeds Police.



M.F. 		Arguments for &amp; against. (not all heard). 

		Involves resolutions in both Houses.



P.M. 	x/	Gt. mistake to pillory a single area in this way.

		Surely disciplinary measures taken shd. suffice. 



M.F.		Watch cttee. which won’t impose adequate penalties.

		O.P. Member for Leeds, was disturbed at x/ but is convinced. 

Special circs. of Leeds – 6 offrs. recently punished, and high level of offences – justifies singling out this city. 



H.C.		Suppose enquiry reports tht. root cause is failure to amend Betting	

		Laws. 

	

M.F.		V. well.  If Cab. so desire, I will not proceed.  But I warn you tht. this 

means taking not action on a matter which has done more to shake public confidence than any recent event.  



P.M.		Tackle this rather by persuading Leeds City Council to put their house 

		in order. 



Sal.		Wd. be more logical to deal first with betting law. 



M.F.		Yes – if Cabinet would do so.  Perhaps they will.



Sal. 		V. weak posn. to tackle neither. 



A.E.		You will have to tackle one or the other, sooner or later. 







6.	Milk Prices.



Ll.G.		Last year 5 changes.  Propose this year only 2. 

		£6¾M. saving to Exchequer.  And wd. help in disposing of surplus. 



P.T. 		How much on non-welfare milk? 



R.A.B. 	About £30M. 



R.A.B.		This is only a small attempt to reduce burden.  

		Wish to raise with Cab., before Budget, levy &amp; one other plan.

		At Cab. next week.  Wd. appear in Budget speech.



		Agreed : Mon. or Wed., whichever suits.



		Memo. approved.  





8.	Persia.



A.E.		Posn. is serious.  Americans are perturbed.

Figures are diff. to reconcile. 

U.S. claim co. ask £280 M for 60% interest.  Shell endorse this

U.S. offer is worth £171 M. that is negotiable gap. 

Persian contn. is compensn.  Co. want 12½% in free oil : value 55/= p ton : and puts P. contn. at £132 M.  U.S. say it’s worth £530 M. – reckoning at £5 a ton.  U.S. say co. won’t get compensn. for [out of] future profit.  Everyone save Co. are opposed to oil at cost.

Have bn. rough with Fraser.  Told him we had done much to to give him this chance.  Not therefore solely commercial affair.

U.S. cos won’t agree to oil at cost &amp; may break &amp; go home Thurs. 

That will wreck all our chances with P. opinion.

On Fraser’s figures U.S. offer is £96.4 M.  And it was worth nil before.  He says, however, he cdn’t put it to his Bd.  

Fear Fraser doesn’t want agreemt.  

Ordered him to meet U.S. this p.m.  He will discuss P. paymt to Co.  Hoover thinks £100 M. wd. be a fair aim.  So we cd. agree with U.S. on £100 M &amp; £96.4 : total compensn.  Not bad.  

I will ask Hoover how £100 M cd. be secured. 

U.S. have submd. memo.  Fraser wants 2 days to reply.  Will try to persuade U.S. to wait for that. 

Prs. at next round I shd. have support of some colleagues. 



P.M.		Woolton. and H.M.  			Agreed.

RAB to stand by.



A.E.		I will circulate memo. to Cabinet.
