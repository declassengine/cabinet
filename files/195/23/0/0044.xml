C.M.(64)16 3 March 1964. 11 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

2. Defence Reorganisation. (oral)

M.D. Govt. defeated in Lords on “Navy Board”. Must now decide in Commons. Cd. probably prevail : but might be reversed in Lords. If so Commons wd. either have to acquiesce or contest and lose Bill.

M.W.P.(C) I resisted on instructions, on understanding, so important it wd. be reversed. Now it is not important! A great pity.

M.D. Not unimportant : but less important than losing Bill.

M.W.P.(C) But Lords wd. acquiesce in Commons reversal. No doubt on that.

L.Ch. Don‟t encourage revolts in Lords. Remember R.P.M. Bill coming.

Ch.Whip. There wd. be good deal of support in Commons for Admy Bd. : wiser therefore to accept.

3. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Cyprus

F.S. Resn. may now be accepted : air of subdued optimism.

b) S. V.Nam

F.S. Have made clear to U.S. our support in S.V.N. limited to support of defensive role. Will warn Cab. if U.S. really do change policy.

P.M. Ought U.S. to move over to invasion of N.V.N.? Perhaps not.

M.D. Pentagon likely to press for this without our encouragement!

c) Libya

F.S. L. restless about Treaty : may have to raise at D.O.P.

4. Cuba. (oral)

S/S.I. 4 firms have signed letters of interest : C. insisting on credit facilities being settled by Thursday. Firms have gone ahead on strength of our policy and are entitled to ECGD cover for bad risks as well as good ones.

F.S. Need we go to £4 m p.a.? Do rather less : and do it under S.I. (commercial) not under S.2 (natl. interest).

S/S.I. Agree on S.I. provided Advisory Cttee. endorse (as they prob. will).

They won‟t meet until 18 : may have to start with S.2 and switch.

M.D. Useful if S.I. wh. is wholly commercial, since Govt. not involved.

S/S.I. But we can‟t then limit amount. A Cttee. wdn‟t accept interference on this. I will check on this.

Ch.Exch. They cd. protest if we went further, under S.I., than they advised; doubt if they can if we don‟t go as far as they advise.

P.M. Must moderate as far as we can : otherwise risk of reprisals.

S/S.I. 4 firms = £1.6 m. But 1000 Leyland buses (an option) = £9 m. + over 10 yrs. Risk of reprisals here more speculative.

P.M. F.S. and S/S.I. to settle tomorrow. Limit to £1.6 m. under S.I. : refer Leylands timing to Cab. before settlement.

5. Monopolies, Mergers and Restrictive Practices.

C.P.(64) 60 [Enter Att. Gen.

S/S.I. Redrafted : hope now agreed.

New introdn. Monopolies section – as agreed : on powers, amplified para 16. and have redrafted paras 17 and 18.

L.Ch. Para 16, last sentence. Illustrations are relevant to R.P.M. Bill. Avoid overlap by stopping at “expanded”.

M.Lab. “Have not been found suitable” … “all those practices” …

L.Ch. Para 20. Add “mergers and commercial services” after “monopolies”.

S/S.I. Mergers section as was. Para 27 : make clear exercise of power to be subject to Parly approval.

L.Ch. Paras 23 and 25 inconsistent : refce. to Cmn. wd. hold up a merger.

Ch.Duchy. Policy wrong : you can‟t break up a merger fairly. Better to let B/T refer to Cmn. and prevent, if necy. : but not unscramble.

P.M. But v. awkward while merger is being held up.

S/S.I. And we are avoiding saying we will unscramble.

Att.Gen. But when you unscramble, you have got to find a buyer.

L.Ch. At least it involves putting somebody in to manage the company.

Ch.Exch. Even so, break up can be done in some cases. Must therefore have powers.

M.H. And rely on these (monopoly powers) to deal with mergers. Avoid special proposals to deal with mergers while in process. Deal simply with monopolies where they are confirmed.

F.S. Para 18, para 27 and para 45 all refer to powers without specifying.

Att.Gen. No difficulty in taking powers : difficulty is in using and enforcing them.

L.Ch. U.S. do it by injunction. Doubtful if our courts wd. do this.

F.S. ?Omit last sentence of para 27.

M.P. What about Press Mergers Report? Sweep them into this?

L.Ch. No : merely assume they will be covered.

S/S.I. R.T.P. section. New emphasis in para 33.

L.Ch. Para 32 : must by “agreements for exchanges of informn.”

Para 40 : sq. Br. words – don‟t highlight this.

M.A.F.F. Must have them in : otherwise discourage desirable process.

L.Ch. But opens door to any “small concern” – e.g. small shopkeeper.

Confine to formers‟ orgns : and put elsewhere in draft.

M.A.F.F. But they are caught under ‟56 Act : and shd. be let out.

S/S.I. Stop at “trading locally” : omit “the”. Better omit altogether : will discuss with M.A.F.F. Services : even more pragmatic in approach. Will make even clearer Govt. will keep control. Para 44. They have in mind particularly commercial services relating to goods – and make penultimate sentence. Can‟t confine merely to maintenance services, since these are mainly small use.

L.Ch. But wording comprises everything – including Stock Exchange etc. we are clearly commercial services. Better to say we are starting with services related to goods, leaving open extension to services such as laundries, hairdressers etc.

M.T. Insert exclusion of shipping conferences at end of 44.

Ch.Exch. Services not really important.? Limit selves to general enquiry by M. Cmn. as first step.

L.Ch. I agree.

M.D. Can‟t do services without labour – T.U. practices etc.? Ask M.C. to review both.

M.Lab. No : can‟t do labour this way.

L.Ch. Can‟t avoid labour, if we do services.

L.P. But don‟t do labour incidentally. And watch political reactions of doing it at all.

P.M. I agree : not in this W.P. And it follows that refce. to services shd. be limited.

Must avoid being asked whether this or that service is included.

Better to say we are going to have a purely general review.

[Exit P.M.

M.H. After paras 42 and 43, merely say Govt. will seek experienced advice (e.g. from Chairman of M. Cmn.) about how to tackle services.

L.Ch. Too weak. Get M. Cmn. to conduct general review.

M.D. Too wide. Try to defer whole issue.

F.S. Wise to include R.P.M. paras? Omit.

And reconsider services paras on Ch. Exch‟s lines.
