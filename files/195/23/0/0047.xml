C.M.(64)19 17 March 1964. 11 a.m.

1 Resale Prices Bill. (oral)

P.M. S/S.I. and Ch. Whip to group amdts. : then group of Ministers under L.P.S. shd. consider handling, including some degree of concession to opponents among Govt.‟s supporters – e.g. proposals by L.P. and M.H. (minimum critical price margin.)

S/S.I. But don‟t let down Party, wh. supports the Bill : so does a large part of public opinion. Can‟t concede too much to opponents in Party.

L.P.S. There must be some “give” : otherwise shan‟t get Bill through.

M.W.P.(C) If bill to be law by Whitsun, Lords timetable allows no delay in Commons.

Ch.Whip. All turns on acceptability of crucial amdt. wh. alters drafting, but hardly substance, of onus of proof clauses.

2. Parliament. (oral) [Enter S/S.S.

L.P.S. As in statement.

3. Royal Prerogative of Mercy. (oral)

H.S. Granted reprieve to …………… since incapacitated and would have to be carried to Execution.

P.M. Cabinet endorse(?)

4. Malta. (oral)

C.S. Now agreed that B. Olivier will conduct referendum on his own proposals. In light of result, we will consider our policy. Announce today.

5. Cyprus. (oral)

F.S. Lindt now appears liable to be acceptable as mediator.

P.M. Ridiculous that all regional pacts shd. be excluded. Must pursue this in future.

6. Support Costs. (oral)

Ch.Sec. Have finished round of discussions. Current agt. will be fully implemented by expiry : but further discussions needed about further agt.

7. Trade Unions and the Law. C.P.(64)73 [Enter A.G.

M.L. Have discussed with Woodcock. Second sentence of para 2 of Annex A is acceptable to him : even expand to indicate T.U.‟s will inform Govt. of their views when ready. T.U.C. therefore appear anxious to co-operate.

P.M. Scope of enquiry : see A.G.‟s letter.

M.L. See Annex B. Must avoid any precise indication of scope at this stage and rest on “law : not practice”. In fact some of A.G.‟s items wd. wreck prospects of agreed enquiry.

P.M. But equally can‟t say that any particular item in A.G.‟s list will not be dealt with.

Ch.Exch. And avoid any commitment to have enquiry only if T.U. agree about scope.

Ch.D. Annex B. v. wide indeed. ?Better to say “No” – but some overlap.

Ch.Exch. Avoid “No” : but stress purpose of enquiry is to deal with law.

L.P. First sentence of Annex A : “enquired into” for “reviewed” ) Agreed

Second “ “ “ “ : omit “undoubtedly”. ) “

H.S. Avoid insertion of refce. to pending views of T.U.‟s immediately before sentence indicating Govt.‟s decision to review.

M.L. ?Better to announce this week – before T.U.C.‟s own statement on Monday.

Ch.D. Yes : but then include addendum about T.U.C.‟s views. Best at end of para.

P.M. Announce Thursday.

8. Divorce Jurisdiction. C.P.(64)72

L.Ch. As in memm. Denning wd. now support change.

Difficult to defer decision any longer. If no change, offend Law Socy.

If approve change, offend Bar Council and Ch./England.

Make change : no alteration of substance and no change in basis of law about divorce. Involved 2/3 cl. Bill : but need not legislate this Session.

P.M. Then why do anything? Politically wiser to say no time for legn. and therefore decn. shd. be deferred till new Parlt.

L.P. i) Cdn‟t remit custody of children &amp; financial arrangements to C.C.

registrar.

ii) And solicitors will sometimes connive at collusive divorces.

L.Ch. i) can be dealt with. ii) is not a real risk.

Ch.Sec. Cost of legal aid is attracting criticism : here is a remedy.

A.G. I agree with L.P. on (ii).

M.D. And oppn. of Church shd. not be provoked at this stage.

L.Ch. I will say no possibility of legn. and v. arguable on merits. But will indicate personal support. Can get away with this.

P.M. Agree. No public indicn. Govt. will reconsider in new Parlt.

[Exit A.Gen.

9. Rent Control. C.P.(64)71

M.H.L.G. As in memm.

M.P.B.W. I agree. But ? amount of rise in controlled rents.

M.H.L.G. I cd. say will not exceed 10/- a week in any case.

L.P. Can‟t raise c. rents now : so why say anything?

M.H.L.G. Because I shall be asked : and because must be honest if we return to power.

L.P.S. Better to say don‟t rule out increase, but shall have to consider after M.H. Report.

M.H.L.G. Can‟t link c. and dec. rents too closely. But can indicate increase in c. rents is something wh. no Party can exclude. Link this closely with no block decontrol, wh. otherwise may imply no increase in c. rents.

10. P.O.S.B. : Removal from London. (C.P.(64)66 &amp; 69

[Enter P.M.G.

P.M.G. Teeside 13.9%: Merseyside 19.7%: Glasgow 13%: - %ages of female clerical workers in relation to total female unempt.

M.T. M‟side feel left in cold : and some concerns - M.P.W.B. and Central Waterways – are leaving M‟side.

Glasgow comes second : stronger claims than T‟side, wh. has had a lot.

H.S. Glasgow shd. have it – it offers least attractions to industry from south and therefore shd. have priority in case where Govt. are in control.

Ch.Sec. Staff know (tho‟ not told) management prefer T‟side : and it is their preference too. Give weight to this.

M.P. Split POSB in two.

Ch.S. Impracticable. T‟side avoids heavy commuting wh. wd. be involved at Glasgow.

P.M. T‟side will be out of wood v. soon. G. is more stubborn problem – continuing emigration of young people from Scotland.

S/S.S. G. wd. get better publicity than T‟side or M‟side. Commuting problem not serious : lot of new housing.

M.H.L.G. Regional policy depends on reinforcing success. Only office empt. is lacking on T‟side. This wd. clinch it.

S/S.I. I agree : and %age of juvenile unempt. is higher than in G. or M‟side.

Impact wd. be considerable.

M.H. But args. against G. apply to any move to G. Is nothing ever to be done for Scotland? Beware of disincentive to business.

M.L. G. has largest amount of total unempt. (31.000) : and that shd. be decisive.

M.W.P.(D) But if staff oppose G., v. bad advt. Therefore prefer T‟side.

H.S. Then we shall always take easiest course!

L.P. But in T‟side it wd. be decisive in tipping balance. Thereafter, we need not worry any more about T‟side.

P.M. On balance, N.E.? [Vote : Glasgow – 14 : T‟side – 9.]

P.M.G. to verify how large a row with staff if G. Reconsider next week.

[Exit P.M.G.

11. Farm Price Reviews. (oral)

M.A.F.F. Settled at figure wh. Cab. approved. May be criticised as electoral bribery. In normal review £+12m – wd. be needed to give farmers 50% of efficiency. Excluding milk, this review gives £+7 m. Milk a special case, for wh. nothing cd. be done while prodn. was outrunning consumpn. Now that herd of right size (and still declining), we can and ought to-do something on milk.

S/S.I. Even so, extra income to farmers – even tho‟ paid by consumers. And 2½d. on price of milk indefensible on merits. Increase of 7½% on farmers incomes also indefensible.

M.A.F.F. But incomes are 10% below last year.

12. Electricity Supply Industry. (oral)

M.P. Work to rule on Monday : also ban on o‟time. Demand below winter peak : but union organised, whereas last winter‟s was unofficial.

Full effects proby. not felt until after Easter.

Proclamation awkward, given Parly. Recess.

H.S. Minl. Cttee. on Emergencies will take charge.

Ch.Whip. If Proclamn. on 1 April, Parlt. cd. be recalled on following Monday.

M.L. No scope for M/L intervenn. since employers are being firm.

Ch.Exch. And must remain so : it is a demonstrn. against a 3 year agt.

P.M. Watch public presentn.
