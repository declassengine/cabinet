C.C.(63)49 25 July 1963. 4.30 p.m. H/C.

[Enter Ch. Whip : M.Avn. M.P.N.I.

1. Public Service Pensions Problems. C.(63)136 &amp; 137

Ch.Sec. Continue as now – P.I. Acts – for public servants and Forces occupational (i.e. not disability) pensions. This wd. be best. Otherwise adopt proposal to review. Beware of going any further towards “parity”, at £75 m. p.a. rising. Wrong to insulate one section of popn. against inflation. I wd. accept para 12(a) of C.(63)137 : but not 12(b) wh. wd. be premature before the enquiry. It wd. also reopen even harder case of pre Nov. other ranks widows, who get no pension at all.

M.Def. Politically important &amp; sensitive subject. These people regard themselves as penalised compared with those in employment or on Nat. Assce. But I agree with paras 7 &amp; 8 of C.(63)136 : keep under our control. In short term our posn. in relation to pre Grigg widows untenable.

They are launching powerful advt. campaign. Disparity between pre and post 4/11/58 much too great : and amount involved, at £200.000 trivial; and does not constitute a precedent.

In long term. v. difficult. P.I. Acts don‟t really match up to the affluent society. And we are regarded by Ch. Sec‟s pledge to examine as being committed to do something.

Ch.Sec. Pre Grigg widows can‟t be isolated –

a) because of objections to retrospection wh. looks to “parity”.)

b) “ of pre 1949 C.S. widows, who get no pension.

c) “ “ “ 1958 other ranks “ “ “ “

First Secy. Agree on inter-Minl. inquiry, with report to Cabinet.

Home Sec. Parity means preferential treatment for public servant – unless private employer is moving towards parity. Enquiry shd. cover this.

First Secy. Agree. Health, Educn., Scotland, For. Service, Power, Transport, Judiciary, Local Govt. Defence – shd. all be consulted.

No decision now on pre Grigg widows : but priority in enquiry.

[Exit M.P.N.I.

[Enter Parly Sec. M/Sc.

2. Central Scotland &amp; N.E. England. C.(63)134

Ch.Exch. Publish reports in autumn : avoid targets : give specific priority to these areas : adopt technique of growth points; and implement projects

when available. Watch impact on Merseyside.

P.B.T. I agree. But interpretn. of Local Empt. Act will have to be stretched and in due course amending legn. may be necessary.

M.T. As a M‟side M.P. I know that M‟side is jealous of Scotland and N.E.

Ch.Exch. Talk in terms of special problems rather than priority; and for a limited transitional period.

M.Edn. And avoid preempting any particular sum of money.

First Secy. Agree. Consult P.M. about announcement before Recess : Ch.Exch. to do this.

3. Belfast Dry Dock (oral)

Home Sec. Ulster unempt. rate 7½% - nearly twice that of N.E. &amp; Scotland.

B. dry dock now has symbolical significance. H. &amp; W. will concentrate on ship repairing (rather than ship building). For this they need a dry dock. N.I. Govt. Have therefore proposed £5 m. dock plus modernisation of Labour by Commissioners at £5 m. more. They propose ⅓ grant and a £2 m. loan.

Premature in terms of capacity required : 60.000 tons wd. suffice.

But plan to be capable of enlargement : and give financial assistance at “N.I. rate”. Announce soon.

Ch.Exch. I agree.

M.T. I too. Expansion easy if pre-planned. But make intention clear from outset.

First Secy. Agree.

[Exit Parly. Sec. M. Science.

4. Export of Buccaneer Aircraft to S. Africa. C.(63)138

Ch.Sec. As in memo. S.A. Govt. may be bluffing : cd. not easily get similar aircraft elsewhere. Nor shd. we do what, in effect, Oppn. want.

R. Navy don‟t want them &amp; cdn‟t use them. Therefore refrain from giving S.A. any assurance at present – particularly since they may be likely to place repeat order and clearly want the aircraft.

M.Avn. On balance, I agree. But result v. uncertain.

L.P.S. Not satisfy. from S.A. point of view. And shd. we be doing what Oppn. want?

Why not make firm concede as far as possible, relying on E.C.G.D. guarantee?

Ch.Sec. Firm might agree to amdt. of contract, if a new order is placed.

M.Def. I agree with Ch.Secy. We can‟t make arrangements wh. wd. make it easier for Lab. Govt. to frustrate contract.

P.B.T. I agree. As in para 7 but no further – even at risk that S.A. Govt. will refuse to pay next deposit and will cancel contract.

First Secy. M. Avn. shd. proceed as in para 7. He shd. take initiative with firm.
