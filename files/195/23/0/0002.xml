C.C. (63) 48 25 July 1963 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral).

Ch. Duchy As in Statement. Dates of summer recess.

2. Malta (oral).

Com. Sec. Conference must decide:-

a) Shd. there be indepce? Majority want it. Therefore concede in Jan.

b) Indept constn. All. Except Mintoff, want monarchy, C‟wealth membership: privileged posn of R.C. Church. Mintoff opposes all. Therefore I shall propose referendum: defence agt to be signed immediately after indepce.

3. Future Defence Policy. C.(63) 128, 132, 133, 139.

Ch. Exch. Both def. &amp; air expdre rising faster than G.N.P. Therefore their share growing – a reversal of earlier tendency. N.E.D.C. require both investt &amp; exports to do same. Therefore consumption will suffer: implies tighter taxn wh. is a disincentive to growth of economy. No one point– wh. is critical: nor is carrier in itself decisive. But given commitment on deterrent, &amp; Europe, carrier is an addition wh. implies a world role against limited aggression. But battle against Commission is social &amp; economic, as well as military.

Carrier at £140 m. = 70,000 places at universities.

Therefore examine probable tasks in 70‟s; whether any cheaper way of meeting them; whether we shall be able to afford carrier without sacrificing something else.

? Defer decision: tender not required till ‟65.

F.S. 3 roles are essential to our part in world. 7% not too much for U.K. Others pay up to 8%. Margin – in 70‟s - shd. suffice. We can‟t abandon Europe – deterrent: or (yet) leave tho. we shall by 70‟s; or abandon Kuwait (yet – tho‟ by 70‟s posn may be easier). But no need to plan for single handed opposed landing E. of Suez in 70‟s. By late 70‟s, may not need carrier: but must retain during 70‟s. In sum, accept 3 roles on basis of diminishing cost in 70‟s; and have one replacement carrier.

Com. Sec. I agree. Carrier not justifiable on basis of opposed landing. But good case on basis of our political interests and our world wide military presence – wh. means a conventional presence E. of S. (as it means a nuclear presence in Europe). This justifies carrier, since Navy must play major role and its ships must be protected against e.g. submarines – at least during 70‟s. Position thereafter unpredictable.

M. Def. I agree. Better to pull out of Europe (when possible) than out of E. of S. To pull out of F.E. wd. mean savings in other things, e.g. Ghurkhas. But not at that point yet. Until then must not be asked to carry out role without means of doing so.

Eagle &amp; Hermes last till 80‟s: but Victorious &amp; Ark Royal come out of commission in 1971/2. No replacement – during 70‟s (beyond which we can‟t peer) – means end of Navy, since carriers are its eyes, ears &amp; teeth. Viable force in 70‟s is 3 at minimum: therefore one must be ordered now. This commits us no further: no replacement programme. Design study complete: this is known both in Navy and in Parlt. We can‟t defer a decision. I originally opposed carriers: I am now convinced, after close examination, that one replacement is needed.

A month or two‟s delay will not advance knowledge. Moreover, common aircraft now agreed in principle: no obstacle there.

Cost: over 10 yr. period is about £140 m. (incl. aircraft), this is already in defence costings. Economies:-

i) push replacement of Eagle &amp; Hermes out of „60‟s – this postpones £73 m. to period when other burdens may be lighter.

ii) abandon replacement of second carrier – another £130 m.

iii) cut aircraft orders as result of common aircraft: £153 m. = 80 aircraft fewer. (This depends on result of feasibility study. But if aircraft fails I will in any case eliminate £50 m).

If no carrier, our defences will be weaker and costs no less.

F.S.L. Navy needs aircraft over sea for some purposes – reconnaissance, strike &amp; defence – as Army needs them over land. Missiles not a substitute. These aircraft need a base – i.e. a carrier, wh. is self-contained, mobile, operates in a politically neutral medium, can be obtrusive or discreet, are little dependent on shore bases and can remain at sea for long periods. Common aircraft gives valuable flexibility as between ship &amp; shore: v. useful at time when o‟seas bases are diminishing, o‟flying rights are more doubtful, and Soviet naval menace growing. In these circs, Navy cd. not operate without carriers.

F.L.A. Decision needed now. Debate has gone on too long: morale of F.A.A. is suffering and Parlry opinion v. troubled.

Construction does not start till 65/66. But this one issue cannot be isolated from other issues already decided. If it is deferred, they must be deferred or reopened.

S/S. Air If we maintain 3 roles and money is limited, question is one of priorities. Carrier is not at top of this list: it does not figure in any of our contingency plans, except as a bonus. Therefore review carrier‟s effectiveness as a weapons system.

C.A.S. Carriers v. useful. But a little of everything a bad policy. Concentrate on what gives best value for money: carrier does not. So long as we have air bases E. of S. aircraft can be more cheaply deployed from land

than from sea. We are running down Army &amp; R.A.F. Is this a considered policy?

C.D.S. C. of S. agreed on carrier in 1957 and in 1961. Then division of view appeared. Hence Zuckerman‟s panel. C.A.S. appeared to agree, provided that, if money ran out, all weapons systems wd. be re-examined. 3 C of S. agree that, for 70‟s, one replacement is needed.

Ch. Sec. ? Defer decision. Four carriers till 1971, two till 1980. In order to have 3 in 70‟s, no order needed till ‟65. Moreover, results of feasibility study of common aircraft not yet available. If decision announced now and we change minds before ‟65, v. bad. Therefore let studies continue on basis of keeping open option to place order, if we want to, when time comes. Studies shd. include (? in Def. Cttee) examn of role of carrier, vulnerability, alternatives etc.

M. Def. We have evaded decision every July for 3 years. This political indecision is v. damaging. Reopening of my intensive examn will do no good: and it will damage new orgn of defence.

S/S. War One large item for one Service is questionable by other Services. But I agree that one carrier, in light of approved strategy, is right. If Army to be deployed E. of S., air cover essential. We can‟t rely on land bases.

M. Avn Common user aircraft has been designed. Full confirmation not available till Sept: but I believe that it will work and can also be sold abroad. For latter purpose, decision shd. be as early as possible.

On carrier, no relevance to global war. 3 carrier force not a substitute for land bases therefore only an extension of them. But valuable as deterrent to piracy E. of S. and as contributor to certain types of limited operation E. of S. But if 7% an absolute ceiling, carrier becomes more debatable.

Home Sec. I agree with M. Def. But vulnerability? Don‟t incur political odium of delay. If we are to remain a world power, we must have mobility wh. only carrier can give. Problem of cost can be solved only by growth of economy, even at expense of short term Budgetary embarrassments.

F.S.L. On vulnerability, leave nuclear war aside. In conventional context, our studies have shown carriers can look after themselves against attack from air and under water.

Ch. Duchy Posn in late 70‟s unpredictable. Therefore Ch. Exch. has better of argument in general. No point in delaying decision. But to build one carrier does not mean building four. Can we be assured on this?

M. Def. Yes. No question of whole replacement programme. Only one carrier.

First Secy I support F. and C. Secs on political roles. On military aspect, I accept F.S.L.‟s advice. Note that only altve (para 2 of Annex to C.(63) 128) is no less expensive. Is this so?

F.L.A. If no fixed wing aircraft, S/S. and S/A missiles essential. To develop these and ship wd. cost more than whole carrier replacement programme. If we have carrier, we shall not develop missiles.

M.A.F.F. I question carrier. Are 3 a viable force? Only one will be capable of flying new aircraft?

M. Avn No: existing carriers can fly it.

M.A.F.F. Is ‟71 a final date for existing carriers? Why have S.U. no aircraft carriers? How can they operate with no local land bases? Only a nuclear propelled carrier (as U.S.) can do this? Wd. it be death-knell of Navy? This was said about battleships.

M.T. First nuclear ship shd. be available as a project for consideration by Sept. Shd. new carrier be brought into this?

F.L.A. 3 is a viable force. 71/72 is latest date for effective life.

To change to nuclear propulsion wd. delay decision by 3 years: we have no experience of surface nuclear propulsion: and U.S. experience shows costs of construction are 40% higher.

F.S.L. Carriers can stay at sea for 60/90 days, independent of shore base, such as Singapore or Aden.

M. Lab. But supply ships require bases?

F.S.L. Yes – e.g. in Australia.

P.B.T. 2 carrier fleet viable? Why 2 in F.E.? Do we need a military presence in F.E. on this scale? We can‟t fight the Indonesians. Doctrine of world wide role v. questionable.

L. Ch. Issue is not carriers or no carriers: it is 2 or 3 carriers. Difference not vital: 2 will give enough eyes, ears &amp; teeth. Case for our replacement not made out.

P.M. Common aircraft a great advance: and a good beginning to new orgn for defence.

On wider issue of defence expdre, period 70‟s–80‟s likely to show reduction of risk of war in Europe. (But we must maintain illusion of this risk in order to maintain Alliance &amp; keep U.S. engaged in Europe.) Whole prospect for Europe may change &amp; new alignments may develop. Pressure on U.K. contribn may be easier. But this is offset by decline of S.U. power in F.E.; and, by late 70‟s, E. of S. may be most

important of our three roles – and we are only European country wh. can play a part in that area, particularly by way of deterrence.

On money, carrier implies little immediate extra expdre (tho‟ much later; and economies must be found. Also no question of programme). No advantage in delaying decision.

Détente wh. shd. follow tests ban will be resisted by French, Germans etc. If so, U.K. public opinion may refuse to accept this. But to let E. of S. posn slip at this moment may appear, in retrospect, to have been the wrong decision. Therefore, even at cost of more taxes or cuts elsewhere, we shd. replace one carrier and look to ultimate easing of our burden in Europe.

Ch. Exch. But not yet clear that:-

i) 3 carriers are min. force.

ii) 71/72 is latest date for life of both existing carriers.

M. Def. 2 carriers are unviable force.

F.L.A. And 71/72 is, in unanimous view of technical advisers, latest date.

M. Edn But defence expdre is rising fast: social expdre must do same, even with no increase in standards: and growth of economy depends on some increase in personal consumption as incentive.

M. Def. But I have offered v. large economies. And I am convinced that we must have new carrier.

P.M. Resume next week: M. Def. to circulate memm dealing with points raised to-day. [Exeunt F.S: M. Def: 4 Service Mins: C.D.S: 3 C. of S.

4. Local Govt. Re-organisation: Rutland. C(63) 135.

M.H.L.G. As in memm. Timetable of decisions to be announced.

Rutland remains. Unimportant in itself: but a test case. We can‟t demote Burton &amp; Ely and leave Rutland unchanged. Temporarily v. unpopular: but local govt world expect it. But we can conclude it by early ‟65.

[Re-enter M. Def.

Home Sec. HAC divided. Some wanted any county modification postponed until before ‟67 county council elections. This M.H.L.G. does not want.

Ch. Duchy Politically v. unwise. Infuriates Rutland, Isle of Ely, and city of Cambridge. Only offset is acquiescence of other authorities – but not of local inhabitants. Therefore confine ourselves to county borough changes.

L. Ch. As a local inhabitant, I agree. Even county borough changes are politically doubtful.

M.H.L.G. No public interest in Ely, at all.

P.B.T. Deferment doesn‟t help. We shall be asked at Election what we intend to do. Therefore settle it now.

Ch. Duchy But decisions are pending all over country: so we shall be asked anyhow. Don‟t hurry up this batch.

M.W.P. We can‟t halt the whole machinery without political discredit.

First Secy No case for c.b. status for Cambridge. But need we act before Election?

M.H.L.G. Commission may resign. But I will compromise on my proposals. Excluding Rutland – on basis of some formula of excuse, wh. I will agree with P.M. &amp; First Secy.

M.H. Probably right. We can‟t just stall. No real opposition in the four counties; and larger &amp; more viable units desirable for health services.

M. Edn And for educn services. Rough on Rutland children if R. left open.

P.M. They can always become gamekeepers!

Ch. Sec. Or poachers!

M.W.P. Public opinion is really exercised about inadequacy of services in small L.A. areas.

M.T. I agree. Rutland ought not to survive more than very temporarily. Buchanan will show this.

Home Sec. Compromise will be even more dangerous at Election than finishing Rutland off by early ‟65.

Ch. Duchy. No: Rutland can be defended. All inhabitants wish to be left alone. Same is even more true of four counties.

P.M. Approve the compromise.
