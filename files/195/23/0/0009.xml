C.C.(63)55 20 September 1963. 10 a.m.

1. Rhodesia and Nyasaland C.(63)155,156,159

[Enter M.Avn. : M/S. C.R.O. : Ch.Whip : F.Sea Ld.

First Secy. a) Dissoln. proceeding well : transfer of powers etc.

b) Constn. of N.R. &amp; Ny. N.R. to have self government : number of Eur. seats in dispute, but Africans will concede 10, wh. is enough. Elections in January : new constn. thereafter : no indepce. till later. Barotseland will co-operate.

Ny.? monarchical interval before indepce.. Col. Sec. against – qua Kenya.

I favour, to preserve Governor‟s influence during new phase. Foolish to negotiate republican constn. in a hurry. Kenya will react on Ny. and on N. Rh. where same point arises.

P.M. Congratulate First Secy. and other Ministers on progress towards dissoln.

M/S.C.R.O. Monarchical interim bad : offensive to Crown : change to republican constn. bound to be occasion of anti-Br. sentiment; embarrassing for Br. Ministers to attend rep. celebrations. Col. Sec (absent) wishes to discuss with P.M. and First Secy. before decision.

Ch.Duchy. First Secy‟s arg. v. strong particularly influence of Governor.

P.M. Undoubtedly offensive to dignity of Crown. But value of Governor‟s influence considerable. Col. Secy. must be given a chance to speak.

Leave this point to Tuesday‟s Cab.

First Secy. Posn. on defence changed. S. Rh. are reducing RRAF by eliminating many Canberras. No request for aid yet. Let it run for time being and see what local discussions produce. But must decide whether we shall ever need RRAF. Depts. think impossible. S. Rh. will resent this. If we do use them again, will Ch.Exch. provide subvention.

F.S. Can‟t be positive. But black Africa wd. react to any use of S. Rh. aircraft.

L.P. Training and cross posting might remain possible.

M.Def. Certainly, from military point of view. But never more than a bonus.

Therefore answers to Field‟s questions are „No‟.

Ch.Exch. And therefore no question of financial support.

P.M. Why not? We support Indian air force! Let Field see the difficulties,

particularly qua land locked base. But we shall need o‟flying facilities : and on finance adopt proposed formula.

Ch.Sec. Risk of similar request from N. Rh.

M/S. C.R.O. And of reaction by African C‟wealth – even to training.

First Sec. I will discuss further with F. Sec, M. Def, Ch.Sec and Com. Sec.

[Exit M/S C.R.O.

2. N.A.T.O. : Multilateral Force C.(63)151&amp;153

P.M. Formulae circulated.

Ch.Exch. “Seriously interested” in t. of r. v. difficult : cd. this be altered?

M.Def. I agree. We are being gradually manoeuvred into false posn. We are already regarded, abroad and at home, as largely committed to force.

Attendance at confce. will confirm this.

L.Ch. ?Reject on present t. of r. : but indicate wd. reconsider if they are changed.

F.S. Only approach to President cd change t. of r. and even that might fail.

L.P.S. Communiqué after Merchant‟s first visit, in wh. M. Def. concurred, quotes our support of project and hope to find means of promoting it.

Therefore this extent we are committed, morally.

F.S. An experiment in m-manning?

M.Def. Not viable.

P.M. Posn. complicated by change in meaning of “multilateral” since Nassau.

We never underwrote concept of m-m. force as part of our commitment to credit a multilateral force. And confusing that t. of r. use multilateral in new (= m.manned) sense.

F.S. Amend to “those interested in examining the concept of m.m. force”.

L.Ch. Even that wd. go too far. Reject t. of r.

F.S. But, tho‟ Germans have really rejected alternatives, we ought to demonstrate to others the difficulties of this project : and re-thinking might yield some (? m.manned) altve.

L.P. But in context of détente, this project is nonsense.

F.S. But Russians are increasing missiles. We must preserve balance – and

this might be one way of doing it.

L.P.S. And M. Def. has publicly admitted it is feasible. We can‟t now reject it.

M.Def. I haven‟t said that, though feasible, it is militarily a good thing.

L.P.S. If it is a military nonsense, so is our own independent deterrent – wh. is equally unnecessary.

P.M. No – because only we have the U.K. - based air strike capacity for first strike.

L.P.S. But quantitatively , our power is not necy. We only want it for political reasons. That is why U.S. want M.LF. Dog shouldn‟t eat dog.

On expenditure, cost wd be small in relation to total defence expre. of Alliance – and therefore well within its capacity, if politically justifiable.

M.Def. But it is bound to be an underestimate.

L.P.S. Even so, relatively small.

Politically, Russians are not using MLF as bar to détente in those areas which interest them. If we want a détente we must carry Alliance with us – i.e. U.S. &amp; Germany. We shan‟t carry Germany if we don‟t help to make her feel secure.

Only altve. is to develop a Franco-Br. independent deterrent. Do we want this : if not, we can‟t afford to be left out of U.S. German project – or to try to alter t. of r. for this purpose.

P.M. Participn. in technical discussns. more difficult to keep non-committal than participn. in political discussns. Participn. on these t. of r. is certainly out but do we accept them and attend merely as observers or try to amend them and play a serious part?

?Rehearse earlier history – Nassau, Birch Grove etc - and emphasise we have fulfilled our commitment. Any further commitment must be examined without prejudice – not on basis of t. of r. wh. imply large degree of commitment from outset. We are ready to help with facilities etc – but not with much cash : and it wd. be dishonest to act inconsistently with us. Therefore either amend t. of r. or leave them and let us attend as observers, or not attend at all.

F.S. shd speak thus to Rusk and see what happens.

M.Def. Avoid refce to even nominal subscriptions at this stage. It wd. quickly be driven up.

P.M. Confine it to facilities : no cash.

Home Sec. We ought to attend discussions – but not on false basis of present t. of r.

F.S. All right : but face fact that, if we are not in this force, we are leaving N.A.T.O. to be run by U.S. &amp; Germany.

Ch.Duchy. We mustn‟t quarrel with U.S. : but MLF has no political support in this country. Party thought issue was settled by carrier decision; v. dangerous to appear to reopen it.

P.M. Yes : we mustn‟t commit ourselves to join force. But we mustn‟t commit ourselves to not joining it – at least in terms of facilities.

Try to draft directive to F.S. on this basis.
