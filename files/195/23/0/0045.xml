C.M.(64)17 5 March 1964. 11 a.m.

1. Cyprus. (oral)

P.M. Congratulate F.S. on success of resn.

F.S. Next step is mediator. Probably Rolz Bennett : a pity.

M.D. Must get troops out as soon as possible. And must know size of U.K. contribn. to intl. force. At least 3 of 7 major units ought to be withdrawn, leaving say 3.500 there but not more.

2. Trade Unions and the Law. C.P.(64)62

M.L. Politically difficult. First course easiest and least damaging politically.

Second would hold posn. till after election. Third involves risk that left-wing T.U. leaders wd. openly oppose and political tension wd. build up before election.

Ch.D. Draft statement at x : does this mean restrictive practices, right to strike etc.? Politically v. dangerous. 2½ yrs. ago T.U.‟s might have been ready to co-operate in investign. of r. practices; but B.E.C. backed out.

Practices are, in fact, joint : and enquiry wd. therefore be directed as much against employers as against unions.

Our electoral objective is those who normally vote Labour but abstained last time. Don‟t alienate them now by adopting anti-union line.

F.S. We have always baulked at this hitherto. But antiquity of existing legn., and result of R. v B. case, are strong arguments on merits in favour of enquiry. But don‟t leave to Manifesto and risk last minute reaction. Therefore adopt course (c).

L.Ch. I agree – case on merits : and risky to leave to Manifesto.

But (c) too weak : better to appoint R.C. now.

And statement too narrow : don‟t base merely on R. v B,. but emphasise importance of unions, antiquity of existing law, etc.

Not easy to find L. of Appeal as chairman.

Ch.Exch. Enquiry into law about unions (right to strike etc.) different from enquiry into r. practices. But on neither ground is there need for enquiry now, after 12 years of Tory rule.

M.D. And we shd. be attacked for using R.C. as hammer to crack wrong nut : real nut is r. practices, and it is this on which unions are obdurate on NJAC.

S/S.I. Watch risk that unions will protest against R.C. and people will then refuse to serve on it.

P.M. But useful to demonstrate unions not co-operative in review. wh. is manifestly required.

L.P. But we have refused for 12 yrs. to admit that it is required; why do we suddenly admit it now? No real chance of getting legal formula wh. will restrict r. practices; and real risk of being misrepresented – with result of encouraging abstainers to vote Labour.

Nor would anybody serve on R.C. at this juncture, under shadow of election. Therefore adopt course (a).

M.T. If we don‟t act on r.p. unions won‟t. But decent ones want a review; and we can discount risk about Labour abstainers.

M.L. R.C. will not deal with r.p. wh. have to be negotiated case by case.

But it cd. deal with law – rights of individual t.u. member, methods of voting etc. – provided t.u.‟s co-operate. But they won‟t, before the election, though they might after it. Hence preference for (c).

But politically risky.

M.Power. But Constl. supporters may also abstain, if they think we are weak.

Therefore announce now intention to legislate next session and make arrangements for this. No need for R.C.

L.Ch. No : threat of legn. (echo of Trade Disputes Act etc.) disastrous.

But (c) also too weak.

M.D. On r.p. say objective approach needed : fair hearing guaranteed; appropriate machinery for this, wh. may be different from machinery for investigating r.p.‟s in field of goods, and needs to be considered.

This is more important politically than state of law about T.U.‟s

L.P.S. Can‟t do nothing. R.C. needed on law : but not appropriate for r.p.‟s, wh. shd. be subject of new machinery, to be worked out after election.

L.P. But how make them registrable?

M.D. Oppn. realise problem and are threatening to be tough. Therefore adopt L.P.S.‟s lines.

Ch.Exch. But, even if can devise machinery for judging, how enforce?

M.Lab. I agree : that is real difficulty.

Ch.Whip. Party needs to be encouraged. And popular opinion wd. support it – both low brow and high brow floating voter.

[Exit S/S.I.

L.Ch. ?Endorse L.P.S.‟s view.

Ch.Exch. Yes : R.C. for r.p.‟s inappropriate, given NEDC.

M.Lab. But even R.C. on law alone wd. be opposed by t.u.‟s before election.

L.P. ?Suggest confce. after election to settle machinery for both purposes. Admit frankly not politically feasible after election.

P.M. Say now, after election, R.C. on law and NEDC for r.p.‟s.

L.Ch. “Enquiry” better than R.C., while not excluding it.

P.M. Must say something wh. means something. Consider further. M.Lab to circulate new draft statement, in light of this discussn. Must make clear not an attack on t.u.‟s, but part of “modernisation”. Consult other Ministers interested.

3. Rates. C.P.(64)61

P.M. Can we say some change will be needed?

L.Sec. Not pending result of review. But: accept MHLG.‟s extra sentence wh. implies selective approach.

Ch.Exch. Can‟t anticipate result of review : and don‟t accept extra burden on Exch. unnecessarily, since it wd. not automatically (e.g. in case of Socialist L.A.‟s) give equivalent relief to ratepayers.

Ch.D. Go as far as we can to provide relief to ratepayer, for political reasons.

M.H.L.G. Admit some adjustments bound to be necy.?

M.Edn. Last sentence of para 4, unwise. Suggest altve., wh. hints at M.H.L.G.‟s course.

S/SS. Agree – omit T.T.C.‟s : difficult qua Scotland.

M.D. And omit first sentence – ambiguous gubbage.

P.M. Adopt M.H.L.G.‟s proposal : some changes bound to be needed, but can‟t tell, pending review, what, where and how large.

4. Farm Price Review. (oral)

M.A.F.F. Summary of posn. reached. N.F.U.‟s want 3d. on milk (£26 m. for milk alone) : but might settle at 2½d. On that basis cd. settle at say £30 m. in all.

Ch.Exch. Preferably just below £30 m. And increase in price of milk not be easy to reconcile with our insistence on reductions in industrial costs and prices.

M.A.F.F. But can justify on merits.
