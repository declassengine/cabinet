C.C.(63)56 23 September 1963. 5.p.m.

1. Denning Report (oral) [Enter Ch.Whip : M.Avn. : Civ. Ld. Admy. : C.D.S.

[Not present.]

2. Multilateral Force (oral)

P.M. Circulate 4 texts.

Dilemma. We shd. prefer force not to come into being : but if we stand aside and German-U.S. axis develops …?

T. of R. make simple attendance impossible: therefore choice lies between texts 3 &amp; 4, with view to eventual publication, if necessary. U.S. cd. choose which of these, if either, wd. be acceptable.

M.Def. It will never happen, if we keep out of discussions. European countries (including German Mn. of Defence) and U.S. C. of S. are increasingly doubtful : we hold key to the situation, &amp; can kill the project. If we joined talks on present t. of r. (wh. themselves do not commit us), we shall commit ourselves. Nevertheless, I would concede altve. Statement.

F.Sec. I too wish it had never been proposed. But it has been : and U.S. and Germany are determined to have it. V. difficult for us to stand wholly aside. Doubts of U.S. C. of S. have not reached President and S. of S. Risks of U.S.-German axis, running core of NATO with us outside it v. dangerous. If we are observers, how can we contribute to objective examn.? Better to have “straight” repn. with specific reservation on commitment.

Com.Sec. Must try to influence events. Impossible if we stay out and participate merely as observers. Therefore I favour draft 3. Compare Common. Market story.

L.P. Statement shd not only preclude commitment but also make clear that we doubt military value of force.

P.M. ?Add this thought to draft 3 in any case.

C.D.S. Change of attitude on part of U.S. C. of S. because:-

a) SACEUR shd. not have megaton weapons wh. cd. hit Russia and trigger off final nuclear exchange without U.S. control.

b) Therefore his responsy. shd be limited to Europe, short of Russia, and new missile shd be developed for this purpose.

First Secy. That means that we must take part in discussions, without commitment.

M.A.F.F. But on basis of draft 4, amended at end.

M.Def. Yes, because we must remain free in discussions to call in question basis of project.

Com.Sec. On this basis, we may never get into talks. Therefore explore orally with Rusk at first.

C.D.S. Macnamara puts our min. contribn. at $50 m. p.a. – to be found without reduction of N.A.T.O. liabilities.

P.M. U.S. Govt. (other than President) want to destroy our independent deterrent and resent Nassau decision. They wd. welcome a Labour Govt. from this point of view!

Press guidance shd. emphasise MLF only one purpose of F.Sec‟s visit.

Shd. show full participn. on present terms of refce. impossible, but anxious to play such part as we can. F.Sec. and M. Def. to concert with M. w‟out P.folio.

[Exeunt Civ. Ld. Admy. : C.D.S.

3. Arms for S. Africa C.(63)158

Home Sec. As in memm.

M.Avn. We shd. supply tanks : they aren‟t used to repress civil disobedience.

Home Sec. The Russians used them to quell Hungarian revolt.

P.M. Not tanks : inconsistent with our U.N. statement.

Home Sec. Fighter aircraft less questionable; but both they and transport aircraft shd be considered when request arrives.

Meanwhile stick to our U.N. statement for public purposes.

P.M. Agree. I wd. prefer transport to fighter aircraft.

[Exit M.Avn.

[Exit L.P.S.

4. Berliner Ensemble C.(63)154

F.S. NATO v. tough on allowing E. Germans to travel. Alleviations considered only gradually – “all German” teams etc. and some scientific bodies. Also business &amp; private reasons are accepted.

Home Sec. I am in impossible position since odium of refusal falls on H.O.

No precedent for political ban – apart from businessmen – on visits (as distinct from permanent residence) by all nationals of a country.

Businessmen are as likely to exploit visits for propaganda as artists; and silly to stop businessmen. E. Germany does not exclude our nationals on principle.

M.w.P. And why sportsmen but not artists?

P.M. Try to include artists discreetly. [Exit Ch.Exch.

5. Hill Cow Subsidy. C.(63)157

M.A.F.F. As in memm. Until 53 left to each country to apply definition. In 60 dispute in Bodmin Moor led to exclusion of all affected. Review then extended to whole country – with this result. Serious in many cases.

Ch.Sec. Extra statutory notice of 15 months or so can be justified.

M.A.F.F. And expdre. will be entailed by change in pattern of farming.

First Secy. Devon County Cttee. tho‟ accepting, propose compensation. What?

M.A.F.F. Area must be predominantly hill : and farm must be on the hill.

?Maintain defn. as in Annex A but add upland with similar characteristics – wh wd re-include those who wd. be excluded because not in a predominantly hill area. I cd. do this, statutorily, by Order : it wd re-include 300/400. Some ought to be excluded : otherwise genuine hill dwellers will resent it.

P.M. Work out a plan (showing effect on constituencies!) and let me see it.

Might extend transitional period, if plan isn‟t good enough.

6. Rhodesia and Nyasaland. (oral)

First Sec. Banda wants July ‟64 announced as indepce date : and an interim monarchical period before republicanism.

Com.Sec. Is change to republic unavoidable? Use of monarchy as an interim device v. disagreeable. Will discuss with First Secy.

P.M. Agree. Approve date announcement.
