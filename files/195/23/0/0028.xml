C.M.(63)14 19 December 1963. 10 a.m.

1. Foreign Affairs. (oral) [Enter Ch.Whip : Parly. Sec.

C.R.O. (Tilney).

a) N.A.T.O. Council

F.S. Council meeting non controversial on strategy. My own political speech well received. Couve de M. only dissentient on new contacts with S.U. Shot down by Spaak.

Germans now thinking hard about Berlin : ?plebiscite in E. Germany.

U.S. support this initiative. May be taken further when Germans visit U.S. &amp; U.K. in Jan. Large economic element in this.

Cyprus sitn. unsatisfy. Turks have rejected Makarios‟s demands.

I have promoted discussions between Gks. &amp; T. in Cyprus.

On Cambodia, I agreed with Rusk and Couve that we wd. prepare for confce. : but Sihanouk v. anti-West. Future obscure.

No change in our attitude on credits for S.U.

S/S.ITRD. Russians asking for £100m. City regards this as commercially justifiable.

Wd. be mainly plants for terylene and fertilisers. Other contracts may bring total above £600 m. Russians wd. prob. pay 6-6½% rate.

U.S. object on grounds it enables S.U. to divert resources elsewhere: but our posn. is well known &amp; we must adhere to it.

L.P. S.U. may be creditworthy: but also liable to break contracts for pol. reasons.

S/S.ITRD. Not purely commercial agreemts.

P.M. We are in clear with allies : but shd. we hold back an element in possible package deal? No : Germany &amp; U.S. wd. hog the lot.

M.Def. No confrontn. on strategy at N.A.T.O. But Fr. ready to consider on merits co-opn. on aircraft. No real move on M.L.F.

b) S. Africa

P.M. P.Q. today. Shd. we tighten policy – e.g. restrict to S‟town agt. supplies alone?

M.W.P.(C) No : I reaffirmed it yesterday in Lords!

P.M. V. well : but must reconsider in due course.

c) Aden

L.Ch. V. unsatisfy. posn. in S. Arabia. Are we right on detainees etc?

P.M. Will consider at D.O.P. this p.m.

2. Future Agricultural Policy. C.P.(63)31&amp;33

P.M. Problem is to secure share of growth for own industry, consistently with fair treatment of o‟sea suppliers. Cereals &amp; meat are particular cases.

On cereals, negotns. imminent : shd. we open at 10 m. tons or 9½ m. tons as figure for own producers?

M.A.F.F. If st. Quo. at Feb. P.R. o‟sea suppliers must be tied up before then – i.e. by end of Jan. No time for further bilateral negotns.; better to have multilateral talks early in Jan. U.S. oppose this. May have to concede further bilaterals: but must fix multilateral as well – i.e. Bilaterals on 6th &amp; m‟laterals on 20 Jan.

On content of bilaterals, qun. is 10 m. or 9½m tons for s.q.

Recent good harvest is 9.7 m. tons : 10 m. will prob. be realised next year :

A s.q. less than this means a cut. But 10 m. unacceptable to o‟sea suppliers, whose exports to U.K. wd. suffer. They wd. take 9½ m. tons.

But must start, for sake of domestic opinion, at 10 m. tons or at least at “something between 9½ m. &amp; 10m tons”. O‟sea suppliers attach more importance to continued access to our market and consultn. if agt. breaks down than to actual amount.

S/S.ITRD. U.S. Govt. divided on merits of agt. Austr. also hesitant. They will be interested in methods of restraint on domestic producer, and corresponding restraints on imports. In May we agreed on share in growth for home industry: this has become larger share of expanding markets.

My memm. shows this to be unjustified.

Hence importance of not fixing cereals s.q. too high, especially since it will “stick” there. Average of last 3 yrs is 8¾ m. tons: 10 m. is more than ever produced! If we accept it, imposed settlement with o‟sea suppliers inevitable. See risks of retaln. against our industrial exports – in my memo.

P.M. But if no volunty. Agt, either unlimited commitment or imposed limit on o‟sea supprs. Either wd. be worse.

L.Ch. Winter wheat sown by now. Wait for next season and settle s.q.‟s before sowing.

P.M. Politically, must start at 10 m. and end at 9.6 or 9.7 m.

S/S.ITRD. But politically we have to fight for modernn. and efficiency. See my memm!

M.A.F.F. See annex to mine on growth of prodn., wh. has been v. rapid. A bloody miracle that farmers will contemplate any restraint.

Other countries experience even worse – cf. France.

At 9½ m. tons and lowest prices, bill is £75 m. At 10 m. tons, £78 m. – but also saving of £10 m. on foreign exchange.

S.S.ITRD. A marginal argument, wh. has been repeated time after time until we now guarantee bulk of farmers‟ incomes. 10 m is only for one year: when re-negotd. next year, we shall be expected to adjust again.

M.A.F.F. Yes – because consumpn. tends to increase every year.

L.Ch. Too late to play with margins this year. Wait and see if a bad harvest next time.

M.Lab. Ending of open ended commitment a great gain, wh. S/S.ITRD shd. welcome.

Ch.Secy. But if no settlement at say 9½ m. tons, how can farmers be satisfied if we have started at 10 m. ? And what about reaction of o‟sea supps.?

M.A.F.F. O.‟s s. won‟t force us down to 9½ m. tons – or below it. They want new principle as bargaining weapon in K. Round.

On access, I have offered o.s‟s undertaking to consult if domestic restraint fails. Can‟t promise more.

Ch.Secy. But if consultns. show insufficient access, what can we do?

And do we break rather than go below 9½ m. tons?

M.A.F.F. We shd. have to reconsider. But let us gain credit with farmers by starting as high as possible.

P.M. Can‟t concede less than 9.6 m. tons without further Cab. discussns.

Therefore start at 10 m. tons.

L.P.S. I agree.

L.Ch. And in future s.q. must be prescribed before sowing – with no guarantee to increase every year.

Ch.Exch. But see disparities in costs between efficient &amp; non-efficient producers.

System. wh. produces this can‟t be right.

S/S.ITRD. I agree start at 10 m.: but do try to finish at 9½ m.

Ch.Exch. I accept this.

P.M. But if no agt. on this basis?

Ch.Exch. They might agree later in different context.

L.P. Will not popn. explosion &amp; news of S.U. &amp; China help to reduce glut?

M.A.F.F. Many of them can‟t pay. Glut will persist in industrialised countries: hence need for some limit in case of U.K. If not by agt. may have to impose limit on imports. A technical breach – see S/S.ITRD.‟s memm. But consider real effects. Chicken [?] war a real breach of GATT : but we are only proposing to maintain present pattern – and to restrain domc. producers.

S/S.ITRD. Retaly. action against our industrial exports still possible.

L.Ch. And can‟t just ignore treaty obligns.

Ch.Exch. I wd. prefer to return to open ended commitment. But best to defer until K. round gets going – when they may accept what they may refuse now.

S/S.ITRD. I agree. Don‟t launch new policy this year if can‟t be done by agt.

Agricl. cycle helps this – harvest already sown.

M.Def. We are pretty committed politically to the policy. (Hansard 22 May. Col. 451 et seq.)

L.Ch. But can‟t impose limits on o‟sea &amp; C‟wealth suppliers in breach of treaties. If necy., give notice of intentions and defer action for 12 months.

S/S.ITRD. But giving notice means re-negotiating all our main trade agts.!

L.Ch. Then defer to K. Round.

S/S.Scot. Farmers‟ leaders want stable world prices. Farmers want bigger incomes.

If agt. impossible, continue with policy but leave to K. Round &amp; maintain open-ended commitment for one more year.

Parly/Sec. C‟wealth wd. be against any control. All our prefaces. in A. &amp; N.Z. wd.

C.R.O be in jeopardy.

Ch.Duchy. I agree with S/S.Scot. We can‟t abandon policy, even if we defer it.

M.A.F.F. On meat NFU‟s in E. &amp; W. have prepared s.q.‟s wh. aren‟t bad.

But Scots have rejected s.q. concept.

We have got a bacon agt. with o.s.‟s, in face of Scots oppn. Can we try same in case of meat? Or must we rely on voluntary phasing?

S/S.S. If s.q. imposed, Scots NFU‟s will break with E. &amp; W. NFU‟s ; and

some of latter may side with them.

They don‟t reject s.q.‟s for ever: - ¨but not now – on grounds that in hill country their livings will disappear.

M.A.F.F. Increase in consumpn. of beef is 1½% p.a. : in prodn. 2%. We cd. have a s.q. looking 3 yrs. ahead wh. wd. include whole of increase in our prodn. and still get o.s.‟s agt. N.Z. wd. do a lot to get a s.q. on our lamb.

If we cd. settle wheat, I wd. defer meat for one more year. But can‟t risk not getting wheat settlet. and not having tried to get meat settlet.

M.Def. P.M. to make special effort with Scots N.F.U.‟s.

M.A.F.F. Posn. aggravated by emergence of Europe as new (disease free) supplier.

This wd. make merely phasing agt. v. ineffective : particularly since fixed quantity agt. with Argentine expires in spring.

Do I arrange, soon after Xmas, multilateral meeting on meat? And, if so, on what basis? Probably do it: otherwise not seen to be serious about meat.

M.Def. Yes – on basis of discussing several possible solns.

P.M. Yes. I will see if I can persuade Scots: but not easy. Anyhow I will consider.

S/S.ITRD. But watch re-negotn. of N.Z. Agt. They want commitment for another 16 yrs!

I will discuss with M.A.F.F.
