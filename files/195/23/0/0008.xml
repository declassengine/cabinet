C.C.(63)54 19 September 1963. 5.p.m.

1. The Denning Report. [Enter Ch.Whip and Sol.Gen.

P.M. Have seen Wilson. He will not play on Lords device.

He will accept security changes on “defection”. He will support us in refusing to publish documents on basis of extracts.

He agrees little danger of prejudice to Keeler trial, wh. Law Officers have confirmed.

L.Ch. has spoken to Denning, who agrees our course.

Therefore publish as soon as possible.

Sol.Gen. There is a risk that publicn. on qu. pv. basis will lead K. to apply for an ex parte injunction to Divisional Court. Court unlikely to find it prejudicial, they cd. stop S.O. from further printing till after trial.

Agreed to publish.

[Exit Sol.Gen.

2. Indonesia. (oral) [Enter M.Avn. : C.I.G.S. (qua C.D.S.) :

F.S.L. : Civil Lord. Admy.

F.S. Read message from Ind. Govt. – will not condone violence and guarantee safety of Br. nationals and property.

Ambassador nevertheless reconsiders own recall. In light of message, he shd. stay for a time. He might join me to meet Subandrio in N.Y.

But altho‟ unions have been ejected from firms, some hint that Govt. will take them over to ensure production, as a temporary measure. Will it be temporary? Wait and see.

3. NATO : Multilateral Force. C.(63)151&amp;153

F.S. As in memm. Pace has been accelerated because Kennedy now backs it and U.S. &amp; Germany therefore irrevocably committed, if discussions establish feasibility. We ought to shove in Paris group, on same basis as Italians and Belgians, for political reasons – i.e. in order not to be excluded from new Eur. grouping (cf. Common Market) and because of our commitment to explore, given at Nassau and Birch Grove. Therefore participate with explicit reservation about participation in force.

M.Def. Cost heavy. If we go into these talks, we shall be committed, therefore shd. decide whether we want the force before sharing discussions. No military case – Germans agree. Tho‟ a marginal addn. to U.S. deterrent, it wd. be subject to U.S. veto. Therefore £800m. of Eur. defence expre. wd. be diverted to augment a deterrent wh. is already overwhelming. Risk of Russian reaction – U.S. therefore propose to station force in U.S. waters! No support in Parlt. on either side. U.S. now saying to Germans that they are not pressing force – it shd. be a Eur. venture. Even if we don‟t participate, we shall still be able to

“control” it – in NATO circles and if it were used in U.K. waters.

Therefore resist – primarily on cost.

L.P.S. If U.S. &amp; Germany are committed, we can‟t afford to repeat Common Market history of being outside. This – subject to reservation on commitment is a valid political defence. It isn‟t necessarily divisive of N. Atlantic Alliance.

Ch.Exch. What is gain to offset vast cost? Political – as L.P.S. says. But difficult to sell to Parlt. without a lot of preparatory work. And no compensating economy in defence or foreign expdre is offered. Can we discuss without commitment? It ought to be possible.

L.P. Terms of reference would commit us a long way; and, since project is a nonsense, analogy with history of Common Market is unsound. It is a military nonsense, since unnecessary; and a political nonsense, since it will increase tension; and a financial nonsense, since it preempts limited resources wh. are needed either for defence or for social purposes. Therefore keep out of discussions.

M.A.F.F. Ques. for decision is whether we are ready to see force come into being without being in it.

Ch.Duchy. I support F.Sec. But if Cab. are against participation in force, we must keep out of talks. There would be a moral commitment, whatever reservations we attach.

P.M. Nassau communiqué merely referred to “a NATO mlf” as something to which, if it came into being, we would contribute our national force (subject to overriding clause). Even B. Grove communiqué only agreed discussion of various possible ways of associating members of N.A. Alliance with NATO nuclear deterrent. MLF is only one of them.

F.S. But U.S. have now dismissed any alternatives.

P.M. Maybe : but our commitment is limited as I have said.

F.S. But we also discussed at Nassau a m.-manned sub force : and we subsequently said in Parlt. that we wd. try to help it.

First Sec. We ought to keep in touch with it : and this shd. be possible without commitment to participate.

M.Def. We can always keep in touch with it in NATO.

M.Avn. Cap. cost has risen from £500 m. to £800 m : running costs are now at least £10 m. p.a. : and all these will grow during 10 years.

We must be ready for an extra £250-300 m. over next 10 years : and this means either abandoning esp. new carrier, or reducing social

programme.

M.H.L.G. How much does Russian reaction matter? Is this consistent with e.g. a non dissemn. treaty?

F.S. U.S. think they can sell both to Russia. But they may be wrong.

L.P. They are, if my own experience in Moscow is any guide.

Ch.Sec. Force is financial nightmare : and political anathema – i.e. to give nuclear weapons to Germans. For both reasons we shd. not share it : and we shd. not take part in discussions wh. wd. commit us to.

Home Sec. Dishonest to talk on basis of U.S. terms of reference. But, if we make this clear, we cd. attend if U.S. want us. Discussion shd. illustrate dangers and difficulties.

M.Def. Any participn. in talks dangerous. German purpose clear – to eliminate U.S. veto.

F.Sec. That is why we shd, be in from beginning – to prevent this.

M.H. Force is unsound : not a bad thing to miss an unsound bus.

Therefore, stay out of discussions.

P.M. Consider further. F.S. to produce draft formula for non-committal attendance and for refusal to attend – either one or both committees.

West facing a serious crisis. Russians have decided against a war in Europe, so long as unclear parity persists. They are now watching China, not on ideological grounds but on imperialistic and Economic grounds. Therefore they are considering becoming “European” and are aware of danger of war on two fronts. They will therefore accept present Eur. arrangements de facto, tho‟ not de jure. Therefore whole effort of N. At. Alliance shd. be devoted to exploiting the test ban agreement. But nothing is in fact being done; and MLF will make sitn. even worse, because Russia hates and fears Germany. Project rests on assumption that it will contain German nuclear ambitions. This is questionable: history shows that any concession to Germany merely whets the appetite.

It is against this background that we must decide on MLF – we must not lose any chance to follow up test ban agreement.
