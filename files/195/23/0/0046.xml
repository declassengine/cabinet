C.M.(64)18 12 March 1964. 10 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Cambodia

F.S. Have protested to Sihanouk about attack on our Embassy. Due to irritation about conference.

b) Libya

F.S. Must review Treaty. Unfortunate.

c) Cyprus

F.S. $6 m. now in sight. Intl. force may be constituted.

P.M. Mak. “pinching out” T. villages, one by one. Our forces‟ position becoming intolerable. Intl. force now urgent.

F.S. U. Thant sending restraining message to Mak. via Spinelli.

C.S. Intl. force not a final answer. Will confront same difficulties as our troops. Serious risk of Turkish intervention.

M.D. C.B.F. has discretion to evacuate families. Can do it in 12 hrs : does not want to move them yet, but is ready and authorised to do so.

3. East Africa. (oral)

C.S. Reported visit. Good settlement with Kenya, who are keen to strengthen army and intl. secy. We will provide training mission and perhaps equipment. They have given staging rights, Mombasa facilities etc. : and have agreed Br. battn. group may visit K. twice a year for exercises.

Uganda will take part in Nairobi air training scheme and accept Br. military training mission.

T less satisfy. : N. v. weak : no training mission (from any country) for army.

Br. troops to be withdrawn from U and T : in T. will be replaced by Nigerian units.

Zanzibar : v. confused. But Karume clearly the popular leader, though not in control. Great admve. confusion. May be new revn. Have told mainland Govts. that if this threatened, we wd. consider helping – but no commitment at this stage.

Somalia : K. will continue to need our air transport for troops for some time. This will entitle us to keep R.A.F. element in Nairobi : and we shd. therefore do it.

K. farmers v. discouraged : Kikuya squatters etc. A problem ahead for us.

P.M. Shall have to consider.

4. Light Helicopters. (oral) [Enter Parly. Sec. M.Avn.

P.M. Visit to N.I. No successor to Belfast in sight : Shorts must therefore live on bits and pieces.

M.D. Only Bell and Hiller in the running. Equal operationally : Hiller already in service with R.N.

But 20% difference on tenders in favour of Bell. Shorts re-tender has eliminated this and is now just below Bell. I marginally favour Hill, both for common user reasons and for sake of Shorts.

P.Sec. M.Avn. Shorts employ 7.000 : only 120 extra involved.

Westlands more experienced in helicopters.

Shorts have got sub contracts for V.C.10 and O.R.6M; Belfast; and Skyran.

Decision against W‟lands might prejudice Gnome engines for Italy.

Second helicopter firm undesirable.

Redn. in Shorts tender done via £10 m. – i.e. at expense of taxpayer.

H.S. Both firms have eliminated profit. But absence of profit is one thing : loss is another and is only thing wh. wd. affect taxpayer. This risk is part of fact that Govt. owns factory : shdn‟t count against Shorts.

M.D. Westlands ought to have chance to re-tender.

Ch.Exch. Second h‟copter firm undesirable : and W. must be given second shot.

M.L. But W‟lands not v. successful : - due to complacency resulting from absence of competn.?

Ch.Exch. Can‟t subsidise Shorts, against private firm, from Govt. grant of £10 m.

H.S. 7,300 at present employed at Sh. will soon fall to 4/5000 and stay there.

P.Sec. M.Avn. No : 7000 level will be restored. In this context 120 is marginal.

P.M. Accept Westlands. M.Avn. to consider other ways of helping Shorts and let me know.

[Exit Parly. Sec. M.Avn.

5. Farm Price Review. (oral)

M.A.F.F. Agt. possible at £31,284 m. Milk wd. rise from 8½d. to 9d. In each of last 2 yrs, ½d. increase has been made without profit to producers:

therefore nothing new or strange – except will stay throughout year.

Pigs – reduce gd. price by 6d., giving producer increase of ⅓d. a score.

Cereals – increase of £2.7 m. on price : will be offset by effect of standard quantity on probable over production.

Good review – at cost of only extra £7 m. on Exch.

Gt. quantities now settled and will be announced simultaneously.

New arrangements contain incentive to sell (fat stock) on strong market and vice versa. Addl. protection for Exch.

£31 m. = £24 m. for increased costs plus something for efficiency.

Ch.Exch. May therefore be difficult to justify. It equals increase of 7½% in incomes : and, if this is agreed, it looks as tho‟ we are swallowing farmers‟ demands. Increase in price of milk will aggravate this.

H.S. And will be v. damaging in Greater London elections. [Exit C.S.

M.A.F.F. Precedent shows this can be exaggerated.

Ch.Exch. ?Defer effect until 1 May. Mere announcement doesn‟t matter.

M.Power. By middle of May, we are in other local Govt. elections.

M.H. Price of welfare milk won‟t be affected : others can afford it.

M.A.F.F. Case for increase to producers is overwhelming. Public opinion will endorse.

S/S.I. But note inconsistency with general price policy.

M.A.F.F. Accept that 7½% goes long way in first year towards farmers‟ demand for 25% increase over three years. But milk accounts for much of it : and other two years will be tougher.

S/S.I. But this means that we shall have dearest milk in Europe.

P.M. Settle at £31.284 m., agreed or disagreed. Conceal if possible, that it is in line with farmers‟ 3 yr. demand.

Ch.Sec. No further increase on sugar beet : C‟wealth complications.

[Exit L.P.

M.A.F.F. Sentence on food aid? We are third largest subscriber to this programme : and we shall endorse it at UNCTAD. Valuable to say so in W.P. [Re-enter L.P.

Ch.Exch. Most unsuitable form of aid for U.K. to give. Must therefore resist expansion and anything wh. wd. encourage this. Food aid shd. not be help to farmer.

M.A.F.F. But it eases surpluses – wh. does help farmer.

Ch.Sec. Surpluses only arise because of faulty policies.

M.L. I agree, farmers‟ attitude on this is pure hypocrisy.

P.M. Not in W.P. : but in speech?

M.A.F.F. Why not in W.P.! We said it in communiqué after C‟w. P.M.‟s confce.

P.M. No : not in W.P. – in some other way. [Exit F.S.

6. Trade Unions and Intl. Law. C.P.(64)68

[Enter A.G.

M.L. As in memo. Confine to Annex A. But delete para 2. Omit Annex B, on balance.

Ch.Exch. I agree. B. is feeble and wd. not help : concentrate on law and omit para 2.

L.Ch. Party will want mention of r.p.‟s : and we shall have to say something.

M.D. If so, leave whole thing alone?

M.L. I have consulted back benchers : and they want a R.C. on the law.

Ch.Duchy. They change their minds. I support M.D.

M.L. I cd. fob off questions about r.p.‟s What Party want is enquiry into law.

L.P. If so, will be alleged to be attack on T.U.‟s. Electorally disadvantageous.

H.S. But many T.U.‟s want an enquiry into law. And it wd. strengthen morale of our Party.

L.Ch. And effect on Labour vote offset by post Election timing.

S/S.S. We may lose our own supporters if we don‟t take a resolute line.

A.G. But watch indefiniteness “Law” can cover what appears to be attack on many r.p.‟s.

M.H. But altve. – to admit under pressure that we propose to do nothing, at least until after Election – v. flabby.

Therefore adopt A – and include para 2, wh. brings in such r.p.‟s as are a matter of law. This wd. help us with responsible T.U.‟s.

M.Power. I agree.

M.A.F.F. And I.

M.P.B.W. And I.

M.T. And I.

L.Ch. Dangerous to admit any touch of r.p.‟s in A.

L.P. Even so, several thoughts in para 2 are valuable, e.g., full employment.

Ch.Exch. Yes : but omit last half of second sentence, wh. concerns management, not law.

A.G. Four big areas of law : rights of individual : inter-union organn. : strikes : enforceability of collective agreements. Separate enquiries might be best.

L.Ch. Don‟t prejudge form of enquiry.

Ch.Whip. Annex A is enough and will be acceptable. But retain para 2 – political answer to Oppn. on automation etc. Announce rapidly.

H.S. I agree. Put para 2 at end.

M.L. Must consult T.U.C. privately before announcement.

L.Ch. Must be ready with answers to questions about implications of “the scope of the enquiry”. Group of Ministers shd. consider.

M.L. Yes : but don‟t be too explicit.

P.M. Let Group (as before) reconsider draft with A.G. : aim to make statement on Wednesday.

Accept that it will not deal with r.p.‟s, except in so far as they are affected by law. But group shd. get this quite clear.

M.L. to see Woodcock soon : Cab. to reconsider on Tuesday, with new draft of Annex A. and supplementaries.

7. Removal of P.O.S.B. from London. C.P.(64)66 &amp; 69

[Enter P.M.G.

P.M.G. Decisive factors unempt. and availability of clerical labour

Glasgow can‟t offer houses except at 10 mile commuting distance.

And only 5% of POSB‟s business is with Scotland : hence risks of delay. Teeside gives best housing : but least clerical unempt.

S/S.S. If not Glasgow, inconsistent with regional policy. T‟side and Merseyside have done well out of Flemming report; whereas things

like Army are being moved out of Scotland. Can‟t afford action deliberately directed against Scotland, especially since unempt. persistent. Housing will be all right.

Ch.Sec. Dispersal never easy. Depends on co-operation of staff, who prefer T‟side.

Bank agree qua managerial and operational factors.

S/S.S. Glasgow more accessible from London than T‟side.

M.Power. I favour Glasgow : great boost to Scottish morale.

M.Lab. On unempt., N.E. is picking up more than M.side or C. Scot. M‟side feel that N.E. and C.S. have stolen limelight and unempt. nearly as high as C.S. – higher than in Scotland as a whole.

P.M.G. Clerical unempt. rising in L‟pool.

S/S.I. T‟side has highest %age of young unemployed. And essential to reinforce success. Therefore I vote for N.E.

M.H.L.G. I agree – qua town planning.

L.P. And I. Juvenile unempt. high. Also female unempt. More important to do good than to relieve distress : and this move wd. make greater impact on N.E. than on M‟side or Glasgow.

P.M. Defer decision till Tuesday. [Exit P.M. and P.M.G.

8. Compensation for Victims of Crimes of Violence. C.P.(64)64

H.S. W.P. agreed by H.A.C. Then debate and resn. : then scheme can begin.

L.Ch. I support. Probably workable : but does not exclude statutory scheme later, if necy.

S/S.S. ?Separate office in Scotland. Might repercuss on Wales etc. Therefore omit from W.P. but say separate office (since separate law).

H.S. Must be addresses in Ed. and Cardiff. Say so in para 11.

M.T. Title clumsy.

Ch.S. Para 22 : other payments from public funds shd. be taken into account.

H.S. Intention to exclude any payment made in respect of injury but to ignore e.g. retirement pension. Cdn‟t agree to erode e.g. special terms for policeman because he accepts greater risk.

[Re-enter F.S.

L.Ch. But they can‟t have this scheme as well!

L.P. Ministers concerned shd. re-examine.

A.G. Cl. 12. implies whole scheme will be laid before Parlt. by Order and can‟t be altered. Lack of flexibility?

H.S. Any relevant criticisms in Parly. debate will be incorporated in revised W.P. wh. will be guide to Board.

L.P. Publish rapidly – not next week but before Easter.

9. Royal Commission on the treatment of offenders.

C.P.(64)67

H.S. Must maintain momentum of 1959 W.P.; and sound precedent for creating R.C. towards end of life of a Parlt. Govt. shd. take initiative – and also put on record what has already been done in last five years in this field.

[Exit Ch. Exch : M. Def : M.T. : M. Power.

L.Ch. ?R.C. unwise, given other enquiries in train, wh. have not yet reported.

But if a W.P. paras 1-60 partly irrelevant to war against crime and partly out of balance with proposal.

[Exit Ch.Duchy : M.H. : M.W.P.(Ld. C.).

T. of R. wrong – “concepts and purposes” are known already.

M.Edn. No : they are right – they link with para 61 and with Newsom report.

A.G. I support enquiry, now. But T. of R. say nothing about causes and prevention of crime – wh. 1959 W.P. emphasised. And to begin with under 21‟s is artificial and might hamper R.C. And punishment shd. be linked with treatment throughout.

L.Ch. I agree.

M.H.L.G. Causes and prevention must be included. [Exit L.P.S.

H.S. They are meant to be : but if specifically mentioned, might make enquiry unwieldy.

S/S.S. Just had Kilbrandon report in Scotland. Might look like doing same thing twice.

Cdn‟t participate in R.C. : but wd. put Simon on, to take broad U.K. view.

[Exit M.H.L.G.

H.S. I accept this.

M.L. I support. But awkward to refuse R.C. on T.U.‟s and concede one on crime. Delay latter for a bit.

[Exit Ch.Sec.

H.S. No : political advantage in prompt action. But will consider timing.

F.S. I support – and endorse A.G.‟s point about causes. Re-examine T. of R. for this. And W.P. might say more about prison building.

L.Ch. Make W.P. more directly relevant to its title. And chairman a L. of Appeal?

L.P. Decide in favour of W.P. Ministers concerned to discuss W.P. in light of suggestions sent in.

On timing, publish early (before Easter.)
