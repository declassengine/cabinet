C.C.(63)60 15 October 1963. 11 a.m.

1. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Berlin

F.S. Autobahn incident : snowballed : U.S. began military prepns. : I intervened and stopped it. But must now review contingency planning to ensure political control (tho‟ this incident probably accidental result of local zeal by Soviet officer).

b) Indonesia

F.S. No change : sitn. remains bad. No written undertaking to restore Embassy, and no satisfn. about Br. property taken over. Ind. hostility to Malaysia persists : Tunku insists on prior recogn. before 3 partite talks.

We are discussing action with U.S. A. and N.Z. in Washington. We can deal with infiltration but that wd. involve A. and N.Z. and

therefore probably U.S. under ANZUS treaty.

Com.Sec. Must discourage U.S. from undue pressure on Tunku.

U.N. observers in Sarawak might be useful.

F.S. But no more than this : U. Thant reluctant to get involved.

I agree : might damage Malaysia. But will keep in mind.

c) M.L.F.

F.S. First meeting in Paris very “slow” and “questioning”. So far so good.

Shd. we participate in exercise? Play it long. (Kennedy doesn‟t want it before his elections!).

M.Def. I agree. Might send a few chaps to exercise : but not more. Need not decide now.

2. Kenya. (oral)

Col.Sec. Four courses :-

a) accept KANU amdts. : Parlt. wd not accept : KADU wd. revolt.

b) make no change – i.e. support KADU : KANU will sign but declare intention to revoke after indepce. KADU tribes wd. secede.

Parlt. wd reject Bill.

c) postpone indepce. : they wd. declare indepce. : we cd. not

oppose this by force.

d) negotiate minimum amdts. to satisfy KANU and hope

KADU will accept.

I am trying d) : but I may not succeed. Whatever KANU do, KADU are pressing for partition : and KANU may withdraw from confce. Then risks of civil war; and we shd have to choose between postponement of indepce. (worst course), accepting KANU threat to

destroy constn. after indepce., or giving way to KANU. May have to decide at v. short notice.

F.S. Watch N.F.D. If they break away too, unit left is not viable.

Col.Sec. A less danger than tribal violence between KANU &amp; KADU, wh. might involve Europeans. Somalis quieter than usual!

M.Def. No plan for protecting Europeans &amp; Asians. Have asked C.of S. to consider plans for “collecting” them from country districts.

L.P.S. Wd. KANU in fact tear up constn. – or be ready to negotiate changes?

Col.Sec. KANU gaining political support : they will not compromise.

Main issues are:-

a) police : some change justified – e.g. Insp. Gen. cannot send reinforcements to any region without region‟s consent : or obtain manpower without required consent; or enforce discipline etc. without regional consent above certain rank. But KANU want police to be centralised under P.M.; no longer indept. Indefensible.

b) public service : at present eight services – for 7 regions plus centre : too cumbersome and some simplifn. necessary. But KANU‟s demands for centralisation, as with police, excessive.

c) Entrenchment provision for constl. amdt. At present 75% of Lower House and 90% of Upper required. Excessive. KANU wd accept basic rights, tribal rights to land, citizenship and regional structure as in this category. But not regional powers.

I shall try to put these on basis of lower percentage – e.g. 75%.

KANU want only ⅔. But whatever the figure, KADU will be v. suspicious.

It is therefore question of my conscience – how far I can go.

Ch.Exch. Proposed concessions are right. But 90% must stay for basic rights, altho‟ 75% tolerable for regional powers.

Ch.Duchy. KANU ought to take 75%, since they will get it anyhow quite soon.

F.S. Remember damage done to Belgium in intl. field by Congo. Don‟t let Kenya become our Congo.

Col.Sec. Local police think they cd. control tribal warfare : and we have strengthened them.

Eurs. oddly support KANU in public : but privately worried.

Entrenchment v. difficult : it was meant to make it difficult, but not impossible, to change. And if we withstand pressure for change too long, we shall lose all the other things wh. we may yet preserve.

M.Edn. Must support Col. Sec. in going to furthest limits of concession to

KANU wh. his conscience will allow.

Col.Sec. But pro KADU elements in Parly. Party have already put me on warning! And beware of getting worst of all worlds.

First Secy. I agree : Cab. support Col. Secy.

L.P.S. If civil war on a large scale?

M.Def. We have a Brigade Group in Kenya : but we couldn‟t fight it out indefinitely.

F.S. That is reason for trying to hold Kenya together.

Col.Sec. At expense of breaking our word to one side?

First Secy. Must watch sitn. closely : meet at short notice if necessary.

Avoid postponement of indepce., if possible.

3. British Guiana. (oral)

Col.Sec. Last year‟s constl. confce. broke down. We didn‟t mind : undesirable to let B.G. go into indepce. under virtually Communist Govt. Then much trouble in summer. Must now reconvene confce. (as promised) and either devise agreement or impose solution. Jagan has proposed Commonwealth (i.e. Ghana!) commission of jurists. Burnham may accept. I shall refuse. They will then fail to agree, particularly on P.R. (Race &amp; Party coincide and reinforce each other). I must then impose a constn., wh. will probably provoke J.‟s resign. Since no altve. Govt. we must resort to direct rule for a year, while preparations for elections under new constn. are made.

[Exit Col.Secy.

4. The Queen‟s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.

C.(63)181 [Enter M.P.N.I. : M/S.SO.

Ch.Duchy. Insert refce. to rates.

First Secy. MHLG. to agree form of words with Ch.Exch.

Br. citizenship in relation to Kenya shd be added to Leg. Prog. but not mentioned in Speech.

Drop paras 20 &amp; 21 (“without prejudice to Bills”) in favour of rates.

No refce. to housing target.

Home Sec. New trials in criminal cases shd. be inserted in place of legal aid in para 17.

L.Ch. No : too limited in interest. Legal aid much more popular.

First Secy. Put in both. Home Secy. to word.

F.S. Re-word first sent. of para 2.

Ch.Exch. Para 9. “Plans for comprehensive regional devt.”

Delete “These will bring ….”

“to promote investment in new ships”.

Para 14 : delete “actively”

“ 15: “systematic improvement” : “strengthen &amp; extend”.

“ “ “My Ministers will ensure that …. “

“ “ Delete refce to “meet the housing needs.”

“ 19: “tourist industry” for “tourism”.

First Secy. Will circulate revised version, subject to Kenya. [Exit Ch.Duchy.

5. Compensation for Victims of Crimes of Violence.(oral)

[Enter Att.Gen.

Home Sec. Clear at Blackpool that burden must not fall on taxpayers.

But restitn. by offender depends on order of court and is not compatible with ex. gr. scheme.

L.Ch. Restn. by offender is illusory. Present problem is due to reluctance to prosecute men of straw. Not an objection to ex gr. scheme that it does not enable us to make an order for recovery wh. wd be valueless.

Restn. unrealistic until prisoners are paid at trade union rates.

M.H. I agree.

First Secy. Start with ex gr. scheme : move to court scheme later, if necy.

Propose Wh. P. on ex gr. scheme.

Insert refce. – new para after para 17 – in Queen‟s Speech, (Ch. Duchy opposes, as promising legn. wh. won‟t be necy.)

Ch. Exch. to check no statutory authority required to put money at disposal of Trustees.

On 18 October the Prime Minister tendered his resignation

to the Queen.

On the same day Lord Home accepted the Queen’s commission

to form a Government.

On 19 October Lord Home kissed hands on accepting office as

Prime Minister.
