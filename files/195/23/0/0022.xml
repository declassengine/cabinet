C.M.(63)8 28th November 1963. 11.a.m.

1. Assassination of the U.S. President. (oral) [Enter Ch.Whip.

P.M. Saw Mrs. K. expressed sympathy. Great sense of shame in W‟ton. (7000 murders a year in Texas!)

L.B.J. in clear control. Wants close contact with us: further meeting at end of Jan. Continuing of U.S. foreign policy: no great change.

2. Sir W. Churchill. (oral)

P.M. 89th birthday on Saturday. Message of congratulations and good wishes.

3. Discussions in Washington. (oral)

P.M. de Gaulle affable : no N.A.T.O. confrontation. Mikoyan: more credits.

4. Parliamentary Business. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement, ?Denning debate on 16 Dec.

5. Pay of M.P.‟s

L.P.S. Deputation wanted machinery for increase agreed before election, even if increase (wh. our members wanted now) deferred until after election.

Ch.Exch. A possible reference to N.I.C. – for advice, not discussion.

P.M. Better for Parlt. to control own pay?

Com.Sec. V. embarrassing. Link automatically with civil service, and refer parities to indept. body.

Ch.Sec. N.I.C.‟s recomn. shd. be deferred till after election.

P.M. Group of Ministers (incl. Lords) shd. consider &amp; recommend to Cab.

M.Def. Remit shd. cover Ministers‟ salaries also?

L.P.S. Keep v. close about our intentions. No leak!

M.W.P.(D) Reaction to Buchanan : 3 weak points:-

a) our rejection of Comwlth‟s regionalisation.

b) charge that we have lost too many chances, especially in London.

c) gaps between Beeching &amp; B.

Also absence of a transport policy : must present plans as a whole.

M.T. Also i) absence of land use plans : ii) rejection of C.‟s regional plan.

Must give L.A. reorgn. a chance : but not v. convincing.

M.H.L.G. No : urban traffic is for L.A. adminn. – not regional adminn.

C. never even mentioned London re-orgn. This, and similar measures elsewhere, will suffice.

P.M. Group of Ministers shd. consider. Ch. Exch.‟s steering ctttee (with M.W.P.) on basis of paper by M.T. Must be common line for all Ministers.

5. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) U.S.A.

F.S H.M. Amb. Washington emphasises importance of keeping close to Germany in new period. I will try to visit Bonn before Xmas.

M.Def. Don‟t run after them too much.

M.Edn. We shd. revive cultural links with Germany : e.g. German teaching in universities.

6. R.O.F. Woolwich. C.P.(63)24 [Enter S/S War

S/S War As in memm. Issues:-

a) need for capacity.

b) reactions to closures.

c) timing of announcement, if to be constructive.

On a). we are contracting capacity in line with current strategy.

W‟ch can be closed on this basis. Even if war prolonged, prodn. in N‟ham cd. be increased : adequate margin there for this.

On b). reaction as vigorous if closed N‟ham. And clean break better than piecemeal redundancies in both places and both factories running at half cock.

On c). cd. be ready by next week, if M. Lab agrees qua redundancy.

Absorption, by retraining etc. shd. be possible.

H.S. Greater London Council elections in April. Therefore announce as quickly as possible.

Ch.Exch. Emphasise contribn. to modernn. of Britain - correct deployment of scarce skilled labour.

Com.Sec. Future of site? L.A. reaction less strong if they get the site for housing.

M.H.L.G. Yes : cd. be a real small New Town, for scores of thousands.

M.P. I want a big new power station there.

L.P.S. Timing. ?Unwise just before Xmas.

M.Lab. Better immediately in New Year : gives more time for retraining and settling future of factory.

S/S/War. Postponement till after Xmas involves nugatory expre. on wages : and increases risk of leak.

P.M. Aim at announcement before Xmas : H.A.C. to consider tomorrow.

[Exit S/S War.

7. Bank Employees: Legal Expenses of Cameron Inquiry. C.P.(63)22

P.M. Initially to H.A.C.

8. Building Agency. C.P.(63)21.

M.P.B.W. As in memm. Output must be increased by 50% without more labour – i.e. capital intensive industry must replace labour intensive one.

Large informal soundings have shown need &amp; welcome, particularly as regards small L.A.‟s in relation to housing where Agency shd. begin. Publish W.P. on 10 Dec., (after formally notifying leading people involved) with promise of detailed consultns. Appointment of Board and M.G. Dirr. shd. follow quickly.

M.Edn. Draft now meets me on educatl. consortia for bldg.

M.Lab. Don‟t skimp formal consultn.

M.P.B.W. No need for detailed discussns. before policy announcement, in view of informal discussns. already.

S/S.S. Posn. of Scotland?

M.P.B.W. A meeting on 5 Dec; this shd. suffice. But once policy announced will bring Scot. into detailed discussns.

M.H.L.G. Must carry L.A.‟s with us. This shd. be possible.

But watch name in view of Opposn.‟s. proposed National Bldg. Commission.

?Building Clearance Agency.

M.P.B.W. No: suggests site clearance.

Ch.Exch. Building Efficiency Service: or National Building Service.

P.M. Let M.P.B.W. consider name with M.H.L.G. and M.W.P.(D). Also timing with M.W.P.(D).

Other Ministers to suggest altve. names. Cab. will accept result.

9. Census of Population. C.P.(63)23

M.H. As in memo. Admrty. possible. But necessary? Probably yes – changes in popln. etc. 10% sample shd. give adequate coverage of this: and quns about occupation etc. wd. be even more limited than in main census.

100% coverage necessary in parts of Scot. and possible in few areas of E. &amp; W.

Pre test enquiry not burdensome.

No legn. : but O.in.C. next autumn. Quns. to be asked (also subject to Parly. debate) will be put to H.A.C.

Oppn. will probably favour: and can be presented as essential to modernn.

Must announce before Xmas, as basis for necy. consultns.

S/S.S. 100% coverage in some areas essential. No public resentment likely.
