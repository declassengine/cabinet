C.M.(64)15 27 February 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Bank Rate. (oral)

Ch.Exch. Expansion must be slightly restrained : also external rates have

risen : approach of election unsettling : trade figures and press comment need to be offset. B.R. therefore to be raised by 1% (more decisive than ½%) today.

No early effect on Bldg. Soc.‟s etc. I shall admit, if necy, have consulted U.S.

F.S. Entirely agree, even if U.S. dissent.

L.Ch. ?Unwise to admit talks with U.S.

Ch.Exch. Not realistic nowadays.

S/S.ITRD. Watch Bldg. Socs. : and impact on N.E. and S. where large unused resources still. Must therefore examine differential rates for L.A. borrowing.

Ch.Exch. Depends on reaction of long-term g. edged market – wh. may be good.

If so, no worry. Also Bill giving L.A.‟s access to L.L. Fund : another reinforcement.

L.P. Even so, initiative in regional schemes rests often with L.A.‟s (e.g. on housing) : and they can make political capital out of addn. checks to new capital expre.

M.H.L.G. Only marginal impact, given consolidated fund practice.

M.Edn. Watch T.R.C. adjustment : sometimes slow in past.

Ch.Exch. Agree. I will make statement after Questions.

L.P.S. Unwise as a precedent? And provokes debate?

Ch.Exch. Will make it clear not a precedent. But must announce change to “slow”.

P.M. Yes – “on this occasion …”.

M.D. But, if a major change, don‟t emphasise it by statement.

Ch.Exch. No : better to face fact of change.

P.M. Very well : but present as not a precedent and in control of not “stop/go”.

2. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

3. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Cyprus

F.S. Brazilian resn. now before Secy. C.

C.S. If we can get it, wdn‟t be too bad. We cd. support it : both G. and T. dislike it – wh. may help!

Both Govts. more oppressive : EOKA type fighters being trained.

Mak. may ask us to be more positive (i.e. anti Turk!) in keeping law and order. Difficult, given split of police force into separate G. and T. forces.

We must therefore say we were originally invited by Mak. jointly : and any extension of our functions must also be in response to request from both communities.

Must still hope for intl force : but doubtful if we cd. accept command of force now contemplated. U.N. cdr. might be wiser.

M.D. Consider before put 7.000 U.K. troops under command other than British.

P.M. Yes : suppose they were ordered to fire on (invading) Turks?

4. Malta. (oral)

C.S. Indepce. constn. in deadlock. M. parties can‟t agree – on role of R.C. church etc. B.O. therefore remitted to our sole decision, with legn. I will accept responsy. for proposing new constn., but not imposing it. Must first be approved either by refm. or by resn. of M. Parlt. after general election. Constn. will avoid religious issues (and leave them to local Parlt. to settle) except in relation to electoral law, where they must follow normal democratic practice.

If they reject my proposal, indepce. must be postponed – as is probably inevitable anyhow, given Party division. Proposal for refm. will bring this out and cause them to reject my suggested constn.

P.M. Since we are sure of result of refm.,? confined proposal to this and avoid altve. of Parly. resn. Or have both. But make sure of refm.

C.S. Will reconsider. But must make statement today. Will probably drop election.

[Exit C.S. : M.Def.

5. South East Study. C.P.(64)57 [Enter Parly. Sec. : M.A.F.F.

S/S.ITRD. Text now agreed : publish 19 March.

Ch.Sec. Para 16 – now para 25 : must reinstate warning Govt. not committed to individual sites.

M.H.L.G. Hinted in para 24 : but will reconsider.

P.M. Para 22 : put railways point more positively – there mustn‟t be conflict.

S/S.ITRD. Can‟t be too positive until we know.

Ch.Duchy. Omit first sentence?

M.T. Accept.

L.Ch. Acqun. of land point?

M.H.L.G. Para 17 amended to make clear that normal release (as distinct from planned expansion) will produce ⅔ of land.

Parly.Sec. Some reassurance to landowners about compensn. And non-disturbance

M.A.F.F. of agr. tenants necy.

M.H.L.G. Can say latter : on former can say they will be treated on same lines as are proving satisfactory in case of Redditch, Runcorn etc.

[Exit Parly. Sec. M.A.F.F.

6. Monopolies, Mergers and Restrictive Practices.

C.P.(64)59 [Enter Att. Gen.

S/SI. E.P.C. propose exclude paras 1-4 : emphasise proposals based on experience of last 7 years.

Points on conference shipping &amp; agr. co-opves are now being considered.

L.Ch.‟s points will be examined.

Main changes:-

a) Registrar in answer to objns. to putting initiative in hands of Govt. and to fears of industry that they won‟t know details of charges.

b) Must take powers to deal with condemned practices, if these are not voluntarily abandoned. Compulsory diversity, by Order, wd. have to be based on scheme approved by Parlt. and enforced thereafter by Court.

c) “commercial services” being examined by Att. Gen. qua clarificn.

M.T. Can conference shipping be excluded. We protested against such

powers in U.S. Maritime Cmn. : can‟t take them ourselves.

S/SI. Agree.

L.Ch. Must be more positive, at beginning, about benefits wh. policy has already achieved, as justificn. for going further.

Accept Registrar – wh. is valuable.

Para 15 (ii) : suppose B/T. reject proposal by Reg? Better to leave choice wholly to Govt.?

Para 20 : enforcement v. difficult – R.P.Bill, where we have simply taken over section of 1956 bit, wh. is pretty weak.

In so far as implementn. of scheme rests with Court, injunction inappropriate to enforce (as distinct from restraining). Therefore word para 20 more generally – “will seek to give effect to …”. Avoid specific measures.

Omit last 2 sents. 2 full time Dy. chairmen, if lawyers, will be hard to find.

Para 30. Shd. first work out what we can do : otherwise hostage to fortune.

Para 35. It is giving infmn., not agreement to give it, that does damage. Agts. will be cancelled : but infmn. will continue to pass.

But how do we enforce prohibn. of this? And is it a criminal offence?

Para 38. What kind of restrn. (by one party only) is meant? Must clarify.

Para 39. If not agts. to like effect, how justify special procedure rather than normal court procedure.

Para 42. Weakening of law irrelevant, if no harm to industry or public good.

Para 47. “Commercial” : does it include stockbrokers, Lloyds, insurance brokers?

S/S.I. These are policy points – depending on whether we intend to enforce action against monopolies.

M.W.P.(D). Must publish next Thursday, if before 2R of R.P. Bill.

Att.Gen. Para 40 too vague. Enforcement is difficult. Must be either more general or more specific.

S/S.I. If Registrar is acceptable, will discuss other points with L.Ch. and A.G. and recirculate for Tuesday‟s Cab.

M.Edn. Para 14 : make plain industry will have access to material.

P.M. Accept Registrar : but para 15 (ii)?

S/S.I. Must keep some safeguard – e.g. oil (for intl. reasons). But otherwise Reg. must be seen to be effective.

M.Lab. Para 15 (i) : inadvisable to publish long list (based on Reg‟s view) on wh. nothing has been done.

L.P.S. Yes : avoid impression of putting whole of private industry in dock.

L.P. And keep attitude to monopoly in principle neutral.

S/.S.I. Will reconsider publicn.

P.M. If no agt. after discussn. on enforcement, must reconsider before Tuesday‟s Cab.

L.P. Watch risk of compulsory divestment at a loss. A pretext for natn. and subsequent sale by Govt. Otherwise a big breech – by Consve. Govt. – in private property and free contract.

Att.Gen. And how do you divest a research unit and managerial skill?

M.H.L.G. But cf U.S. Sherman Act – wh. has been used.

Wise to say purpose is to create atmosphere in wh. people will consult B/T before risking enquiries.

S/S.I. Yes : and sanction of divestment only invoked after enquiry.

L.P. But it will still be a forced sale – probably at a loss, and without compensn.?

S/S.I. No : it is against public interest.

L.P. But it wasn‟t when he originally did it.

Ch.Exch. But we already have power to stop people doing profitable things.

L.Ch. Different cult from compelling them to stop holding profitable assets.

M.Power. No : without sanction – wh. will prob. never be used – merger policy can‟t be enforced.

M.H. Cdn‟t concede compensn. – without conceding it to small retailer forced out of business by R.P. Bill.

Therefore take powers, but make clear in terrorem only.

L.P. No case known where divestment wd. have been justified.

M.Edn. If largely free market to be preserved, strong powers in reserve needed, so long as Parlt. retains ultimate control.

L.P. It always will – by legn. Different to leave question with Govt. subject to nominal refce. to Parlt. for approval of Order.

S/.S.I. Object is to protect private industry from threat of natn.

H.S. ?Omit para 20 and rest on last sent. of para 19. We are not going to legislate in this Parlt.

L.Ch. Similarly on mergers : can we accept “undoing” in para 31?

S/S.I. Yes – in exceptional case : but will consider putting prohibn. in front of undoing.

L.P.S. Para 52 – drafting in hand and introduce as soon as possible?

S/S.I. Yes.

M.H. Para 35. I share L.Ch.‟s doubts.

S/S.I. U.S. practice confirms firms too scared to exchange informn. privately.

Ch.Exch. And casual contacts matter less than systematic exchanges.

S/S.I. Will amend para 42 : but main principle of 56 Act must stand.

M.P.B.W. Para 47. “commercial services”.

A.G. Rest on accepted definitions.

Ch.Exch. When these have been discussed, can consider whether further defn. required. Don‟t want to include S. Exch. or Lloyds.

Ch.Sec. Exclusion of professions and trade unions will be v. contentious.

L.P. Don‟t include professions.

M.Power. But must include tariff insurance companies who charge uniform rates; and other services – laundries, shoe repairers etc. – who do same.

L.P. No : politically v. damaging.

P.M. Omit 46 and 47 : rest on 48 and 49 done? Admit we don‟t know yet what services will be covered. Can‟t confine selves to small people and let insurance cos. etc. go free.

[Absent for remainder of discussion.]
