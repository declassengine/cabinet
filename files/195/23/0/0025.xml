C.M.(63)11 10 December 1963. 9.30 a.m.

1. Public Service Pensions : pre-Grigg widows

[Enter Ch.Whip : M.P.N.I.

P.M. I. Ward has welcomed w.m.‟s package. Effect will be spoiled if nothing for pre-G. widows? Politically damaging; especially in light of expectations after interview with H. Macmillan.

Breach of principle difficult: but reason for negative decision equally difficult.

Ch.Exch. A date deadline affects all sorts of people. Hence claim for parity, wh. wd. be much too expensive to concede – and therefore politically damaging to concede.

M.W.P.(C) But this point not taken publicly. These widows have always been regarded as a special case and can continue to be so regarded.

Ch.Sec. No: or.‟s widows will be quoted at once. And civil service repercussions certain. P.G. widows have N.I. pension as well!

L.P. Or‟s have no pension at all. Analogy therefore unfair.

M.Edn. We have quoted civil servants in past. Therefore they will certainly be quoted against us now.

M.P.B.W. Must have some regard to politics. A v. small concession.

Ch.Sec. But consider P(I) increases early this year – specially weighted for over 70‟s, i.e. for bulk of P.G. widows.

Politically damaging to favour officer class: o.r. widow, with no pension, worse anomaly.

S/S.ITRD. Less damaging if done as part of widows‟ package.

?Pressure as no more than rectification of anomaly – i.e. difference in percentage on different sides of arbitrary date and only case of this kind.

Home Sec. Marginally defensible: and politically right (tho‟ wrong in principle).

L.P. And better to concede than to give way under pressure.

M.H.L.G. I support Ch. Exch.: we can‟t favour only officer class.

Ch.Sec. And concession might force us into a general review that we might otherwise avoid.

M.D. I can resist repercussions on officers between now &amp; Election.

And these are widows.

M.P.N.I. I agree. We can isolate them as special class.

Ch.Sec. But they are not – like w.m.‟s – women with children.

P.M. Can justify treating as special class and resists pressures.

Ch. Exch. Unjust &amp; unwise: but Cab. want it so and I will endorse it.
