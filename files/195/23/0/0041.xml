C.M.(64)13 20 February 1964. 10.30 a.m.

Parliament. (oral) [Enter Ch.Whip.

L.P.S. As in statement. [Exit C.S.

2. Short Brothers &amp; Harland. C.P.(64)39&amp;46

[Enter M.Avn. : S/S. Air.

M.Avn. Skyvan – at £100,000 a time – almost developed. £1.6 m. needed for completion of devt. and first 10 production. Cd. be found within the £10m. Must sell 150 to break even. 50 may be firm : interest in more. Main value in holding design team, required for Belfast &amp; Seacat till end of decade; otherwise B. &amp; Sc. not finished in time.

N.I. Govt. will put up 25%.

Ch.Secy. Public expre. rising : no addl. projects unless v. strong case. This is not strong – either on avn grounds (no home market: and this has always hitherto prevented success) or on N.I. grounds (we are doing a lot already, including £50 m. support of Budget and the Belfast project, and the V.C.10 sub-contract and the light helicopters wh. are now agreed and may go to Shorts) or on design team grounds (even if we do Skyvan, team may still run down). And 40% of sales wd. go to France (qua engine).

Home Sec. If we sell only 100, we get back all the £1.6m. (The £1.2 m. gone anyway). And v. valuable to Br. aircraft industry.

Politically a v. sensitive issue because of N.I., where unempt. is 8%. This wd. reduce it by 1%, and wd. avoid “dip” in employment in 66-67. Shrinkage of design team bad; mustn‟t import personnel to finish Belfast.

No extra money: the £10 m. already approved (and may not be needed in full).

Ch.Secy. We said “up to £10 m. if necy to finish Belfast”. Not an excuse for a new project. Extra empt. only if aircraft a success.

M.P.B.W. A good risk: endorse it. Otherwise great political damage.

M.Lab. I agree. Unempt. v. grave: must avoid an increase.

Ch.Exch. Shorts are no good at designing, producing &amp; selling aircraft.

L.Ch. But money is available. How can we deny a mere switch?

M.A.F.F. If devt. nearly complete, there ought to be orders?

M.Agr. Yes: see refce. to letters of intent.

P.M. Accept – as Shorts last chance, combined with Hiller – at least before election.

[Exeunt M.Avn. : S/S. Air.

3. Pension of D.P.P. C.P.(64)43 &amp; 48 [Enter Att.Gen.

Home Sec. As in memm. A.G.‟s proposal wd. involve repercussive legn.

A.G. Selection shdn‟t be limited to legal civil service. But recruitment from outside must be from Bench or near Bench : and that means comparable pension terms, particularly since he must retire at 65, not 70 or 72 as a judge would.

Ch.Sec. Extended age of retirement.

H.S. Yes – subject to health and efficiency.

L.P. But occupant will take 65 as the formal limit.

L.Ch. Enough difficulty already in filling High Court vacancies. D.P.P. must be better than County Court judge and approach High Court status.

Tho‟ a civil servant, is sui generis. Compare J.A.G. who was given option of civil service or judicial pension; and J.A.G.‟s functions are only advisory – i.e. nearer to civil servant than judge. Therefore D.P.P.‟s pensions must be better than that of C.C. judge: and he shd. be given same option as J.A.G.

Ch.Sec. Try normal terms first and see?

L.Ch. No : I‟ve made enquiries already.

Ch.Sec. Legn. v. embarrassing : note Tsy. Sol/Parly. Counsel etc.

M.H. Same true, by analogy, of other professional appointments in public service.

L.Ch. Then we must tackle problem as a whole. But that is not an argument for refusing terms in this case wh. are essential if we are to get the best men.

Need merely decide: not announce. Sound candidates privately.

P.M. Concede L. Ch.‟s point: consider how to free ourselves of legve. restrictions on other people if can‟t legislate on D.P.P. alone.

Remit to H.A.C. in this basis: must decide – with refce. to Cab. if necy. – within a month.

[Exit H.S.

4. Resale Price Maintenance Bill. C.P.(64)52&amp;53

S.S.ITRD. Main points:-

1) Prohibits min. price : allows recommended price.

2) Supplier can‟t withhold goods if sold below rd. price, but can choose dealers on other grounds.

3) Can enforce max. price (to remove fear that abolition of r.p.m. will lead to rise in prices).

4) A civil, not criminal, offence.

5) “Loss leader‟s” to be dealt with : but normal discounts wh. favour big trader – will continue and small trader must look to reorgn. of wholesale trade.

6) Exemptions valid for four months from applicn. and apply thereafter till heard. Decision can be reviewed after 2 yrs.

7) Criteria deliberately allows r.p.m. arguments to be deployed against public interest.

8) Can‟t exempt individual trades in the Bill. All must go through the same hoops (since they are judicial, not admve, But palliatives :-

a) certain cases wd. not be opposed. No.

b) insert certain cases in Bill, if approved by R.P.C. or M.C. But that imports addl. criteria.

c) take power to settle order of cases and put books late. But that invites pressure for deferment, since r.p.m. continues meanwhile.

Book trade may wish to be called up early!

d) allow evidence submitted to R.P.C. on net book agt. to be taken into a/c. by new court. Depends on whether L.Ch. will issue rules of evidence etc. in new court.

L.Ch. Can‟t give books special posn. in Bill. Will consider rules of evidence, but conclusions of R.P.C. will be citable before new court.

Registrar must keep at arm‟s length from B/T; but latter must be given some statutory cover for discussion with B/T on administration of Bill.

S.(3) – patented goods – opens large and controversial field. But must accept.

L.P.S. Criteria inadequate. Location, as well as number, shd. be inserted.

L.Ch. S.5(2)(b). “Inconvenience to public”. How wide is “public”? ?Add “at a substantial proportion thereof” ?And “inconvenience and detriment".

L.P. Maintenance services after a sale? Does S.5(3) cover them?

L.Ch. I think so : but I will consider.

L.P.S. “Service” unnecessarily strong. “Substantial” wd. be enough.

P.M. Reconsider.

L.P. Will one illegal condition invalidate legality of whole agreement in contract S.1(1).

L.Ch. Relevant to patented goods. May have to adjust on Cttee. and get amdt. ready meanwhile.

L.P. Important : can‟t have whole contract frustrated.

M.H. 5(2)(b) – “as such consumers or users”. Chemists agree r.p.m. not directly relevant to their N.H.S. remunn. (wh. is based on wholesale prices). But will affect non N.H.S. business: and some will have to disappear. But this will not be a valid objn. if these words stand, since they will prevent them from pleading redn. in numbers of dispensing points.

S/S.ITRD. Answer is to get disp. points right for purpose of dispensing. That shdn‟t need subsidy from cosmetics &amp; cameras.

On S.5(2)(b) will consider “proportion of public”.

M.H.L.G. We shd. say publicly that dispensing fees will be re-examined, without prejudice, in light of new sitn.

Ch.Sec. ?Allow assocns. of retailers to apply to court? Illogical, but politically wise.

L.Ch. It wd. wreck the Bill. If retailers are strong enough, they can probably get a mfctr. or supplier to go to court.

Ch.Sec. But politically more defensible.

L.Ch. S.8(3) gives retailers enough – even tho‟ only right to apply to be heard.

M.D. I agree with Ch.Sec. Political advantage in letting individual chemists or assocn. of chemists to apply. And on question whether clause in contract shd. be voided or not, dealer has as much right to be heard as supplier.

L.P. But Bill is aimed at mfctr. to whom alone cl. in contract is directed. If he doesn‟t adopt cl., there is nothing to protest to court about. And nonsense to empower retailers to ask for maintenance of a provision wh. supplier doesn‟t want to maintain.

M.D. But politically deniable.

Ch.Duchy. L.Ch.‟s “rules” must bring to court decisions of R.P.C and M.C. But a pity that goods so dealt with must go to Court at all.

L.P. Why not do this, subject to review after 2 yrs. like other goods.

S/S.ITRD. But judgments on books etc. on different basis of 1956 Act.

Can‟t simply take them over wholesale.

L.Ch. No : but Court can read judgments (if not evidence); and that shd. count a lot.

Get this clear – and S.8(3) – at time of publication.

Ch.Duchy. S.4(4)(a). Does this restrict right of supplier to choose his dealer?

S/S.ITRD. No.

M.Lab. But onus of proof?

S/S.ITRD. Initially on Crown. Thereafter supplier can show he was withholding in other grounds. – e.g. credit worthiness etc.

L.Ch. And there must be room for new dealers.

M.H. Cl.5. “As users or consumers” will be thought to restrict freedom to plead public interest. ?Omit these words.

L.P.S. Yes. They mean that village shop can‟t sell e.g. newspapers because of aboln. of r.p.m. on his sweets, but will have no redress since applin. can only be about sweets, not about newspapers.

M.A.F.F. Refces. to public interest wh. were made when decision was announced were general and were inconsistent with this argument.

L.Ch. Then delete “such” in 5(2)(b). But even then, these are only conditions precedent to examn over whole field.

S/S.ITRD. Deletion of “such” is a large widening.

L.P. Yes : may cease to be a justiciable issue.

M.H.L.G. I agree. Village shop will be protected by nature of its trade. But widening will prevent thinning out of shops in suburbs.

M.Edn. Yes : completely changes nature of Cl.5.

M.T. And puts premium on least efficient trader.

A.G. Bill can only ask Court to consider distribn. of individual classes of goods.

Ch.Wh. Main Party complaint will be “twice thro‟ the hoop”. L. Ch.‟s rules shd. cover conclusions of both R.P.C. and M.C.

Cost of “going thro‟ hoop”. [Allowed for in Bill.]

W.P. on monopolies etc. shd. be published at same time.

S/S.ITRD. Can‟t be : but can be published before 2 R. of Bill. Will bring to Cab. next week.

L.Ch. S.8(2) on costs. Does it go for enough? It ought to cover part of costs of deploying case again? at least, if successful.

S./S.S. S.9(2). Extra judge in Scotland. If so, must tell Prest. of C. of Session on publicn.

P.M. Crux is right of retailers to be heard.

L.Ch. That will be covered by the Regns.. Can‟t give them, in Bill, right to initiate proceedings if supplier doesn‟t want to.

S/S.ITRD. Perhaps cd. charge Registrar with duty of seeing that retailers are given fair chance.

M.D. We shall be driven to concede right of initn. to retailers : therefore concede it at outset.

L.Ch. Registrar will be deluged by every retailer in the country.

Retailers can‟t make a case except in assocn. with suppliers : and, if suppliers start case, retailers have right to be heard.

Ch.Sec. Not same as letting retailers initiate.

S/S.ITRD. But that wd. wreck Bill &amp; lose us all informed support.

P.M. Right of retailers to be heard must be made clear – preferably in Bill. e.g. by instruction to Registrar. Authorise publication as soon as possible.

[Exeunt F.S. M.H.L.G., M.W.P.(C). Att.Gen.

5. Postmen‟s Pay. C.P.(64)54 [Enter P.M.G.

P.M.G. As in memm. Industrial action may develop in London, if we reject proposal. It implies average of 4½% over first year and 3¾% over 3 yr. period. Therefore only ½% at stake : and public opinion wd. support postmen.

M.Lab. Even 4½% stretches incomes policy: 5% too high. But I cdn‟t intervene if indl. action develops. If it does we mustn‟t capitulate.

Ch.Exch. Settlement with non-indl. C.Service wd. be jeopardised by this.

Discontent with ‟63 settlement – based on PRU survey and arbitrn. – not valid ground; wd. jeopardise arbitral procedures. Their fault if they won‟t have arbitrn.

P.M.G. Wd. help presentationally if we went to 4½%.

M.A.F.F. No: too near 5%. If a row it must be about at least 1%.

M.P. Note elecy. supply analogy . Supervisory grades settled satisfactorily; manual grades will take a long time. No real risk here.

P.M. Support Ch.Exch. And stick to “4% in arbitrn.”.
