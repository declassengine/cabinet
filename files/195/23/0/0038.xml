C.M.(64)10 6 February 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip.

L.P.S. As in statement.

Ch. Tunnel statement approved for to-day.

2. Zanzibar. (oral)

C.S. May be ejected (H.C.) unless we recognise quickly.

Have asked Nyerere to advise Karume to play it slow. Meanwhile, must take risk of being ejected: too difficult to recognise prematurely. Gambit may succeed.

P.M. Agree – tho‟ no easier the longer it is put off.

3. S. Rhodesia. (oral)

C.S. Recent discussion with W. Field show that he won‟t make significant concessions at this stage. But we can‟t grant formal indepce. on this basis – at least without splitting C‟wealth.

If so, either S. Rh. must take indepce: or issue must be put in cold store. Choice uncertain. Must enlist Old C‟w. support in restraining S. Rh. : but upshot doubtful. If unitl. decln. must either treat as colony in revolt: or ignore. Latter valid only if a mere gesture of defiance, not enacted in legn.

P.M. If they take indepce. they will want to retain Queen. Politically v. awkward to involve Crown. Yet prospect of Afr. majority in 15 years – already feasible – not unreasonable in light of recent devts. in E. Africa.

Field can‟t afford a Zanzibar.

L.P. Yes : but F. must equally understand our position and not embarrass us or the Crown.

P.M. But we shall be giving indepce. to N.Rh. &amp; Ny. Makes it v. difficult for S. Rh.

L.Ch. If unilatl. decln., we can‟t merely ignore – if only because of Queen.

C.S. Agree, if they try to enact legn.. But mere decln. – and there wd. be no need for them to legislate – mighty be ignorable. They will prob. negotiate.

L.Ch. Must have urgent examn. of constl. implications of posn. of Queen.

DO(O) to consider to-morrow and produce memm for Cab. next week.

Shd. cover franchise: and training of Africans for responsy.

4. Cyprus. (oral)

C.S. Mak‟s reply not too bad. His conditions may be negotiable – including link with U.N., provided this does not involve e.g. Soviet veto. But general blessing by Secy. Council shd. be possible.

M.W.P.(C) Don‟t assume this. Fr. won‟t support us.

P.M. S.C. mustn‟t get a real hold on the plan.

5. Statement on Defence 1964. C.P.(64)32 [Enter M. Avn.

M.D. Omit last sentence of para 7.

M. Avn. Fissile material o.k.? Shall we have enough? (Para 28)

M.D. I think so. Any emergency wd. have to be examined on merits.

L.Ch. Para 12. “Arms Across Sea” a bad title.

M.D. Will reconsider.

M.L. Army : para 29. Some recovery at end of year? If so, say so.

M.D. Don‟t try to cover up. It was a bad year. But might omit “serious”.

P.M. Omit last sentence of para 17. Any other drafting amdts to M. Def.

Paragraph numbering to be consecutive throughout.

6. Nationalised Industries : Salaries. C.P.(64)_27.

[Enter Sol.Gen

Ch.Exch. As in memm.

M.P. Wd. prefer higher salaries: but accept provided members‟ band rises to £9,500. Increases urgent.

M.T. Strongly agree.

M.W.P.(D) Justificn. must rest less on need to attract good men as on need to provide career structure in the industries.

M.Avn. Agree on £9,500. No power to prevent B.O.A.C. going to this figure.

M.L. Careful! 3½% not bad but not easy to put across. Stick at £9,000.

Ch.Exch. Can‟t exceed para 4. But wd. accept £9,500 provided band is really a band and £9,500 not merely a new fixed figure.

M.L. All right.

S/S.S Special considn. for chairman of S. Elecy. Bd. in Scot.

Ch.Exch. Will consider.

M.Edn. Presentationally, link with new measures to put natd. industries on more commercial footing, wh. are already bearing fruit.

P.M. Decide in light of –

7. Higher Judiciary: Salaries. C.P.(64)35 [Enter F.S.

L.Ch. As in memm.

Ch.Exch. Legn. v. awkward. Everybody in table has higher salary than we do.

Therefore don‟t do anything until we deal with M.P.‟s &amp; Ministers next Session, especially since ‟54 increase said to be for a generation.

L.Ch. No link with us, except as regards me!

Ch.Secy. But Bill not giving amounts may create much misunderstanding especially since we are not finding time to legislate for public service pensioners.

L.Ch. An assurance much less satisfy. than a public Bill.

Sol.Gen. Recent lack of recruits to Bench is clear warning; inferior judicial posns. now more attractive than superior!

L.P. Lack of recruits has always been with us; differential between Bench &amp; Bar has been even greater in the past, because of taxn.

Ch.Duchy. Not an election winner : assurance shd. suffice.

M.H. And Bill wd. have to provide details of salaries, leaving amdt. to O.-in-C.

L.Ch. Then settle as for M.P.s etc. – i.e. bipartisan statement of assurance that will be dealt with next Session.

P.M. Better public Govt. statement, to be endorsed by Oppn. (on basis of private understanding with Leader of Oppn.)

L.Ch. Accept. Will then discuss details of amounts – and machinery (?for lower as well as higher judiciary) – with Ch.Exch.

P.M. Agree natd. inds. – at £9,500. Announcements to be co-ordinated.

[Exeunt M. Avn. Sol. Gen.

8. British Guiana : Oil Imports. C.P.(64)36

C.S. As in memm.

M.P. V. little interest hitherto. But Cuba has now offered compensn. – wh. is embarrassing to Shell. Prob. accept proposal.

S/S.ITRD. Difficult to embargo after they have offered compensn.

Ch.Exch. And might stir up buses dispute again.

C.S. Real reason is that oil is Russian, wh. we embargo here; and we don‟t want to let Br. G. get in Cuban clutches. But compensn. makes it more arguable. Will reconsider.

L.Ch. Cd. embargo until we get compensn.

S/S.ITRD. But that may involve compensn. of U.S. interests: v. embarrassing.

M.H. And if compensn. agreed, we shd. then be bound to allow Russian oil in.

F.S. I will examine with C.S. and S/S.ITRD.

9. Plowden Report. C.P.(64)33 &amp; 34

F.S. Approve &amp; get on with it.

Must settle grants to seconded officers and future of C.O.

C.S. Support : v. valuable help to C‟w. service in period of pressure &amp; expansion.

Must absorb C.O. by 1/7/65. (Must be specific on this, for sake of assurance to staff.)

Best to announce decision at same time as publicn. (But ?discussions with staff unions).

L.Ch. Does it imply that C‟w. countries are now on par with foreign countries.

Amend “continuing to demonstrate” in para 3.

Ch.Sec. B. School allowances when officer is at home: a problem. Depends on Law Officers.

Extension of D.S. allce. to B/T. is at variance with Plowden and not justifiable on merits.

F.S. If Law Officers allow tax empn., well &amp; good. Otherwise must gross up. Amdt. in Fin. Bill v. embarrassing.

S.S.ITRD. D.S. allce. is for unforeseen contingencies of o‟sea service. More likely to apply to seconded officer than to career officer. And discrimn.

within a Mission psychologically unsound. And secondment is voluntary. Level of commercial represn., and facilities for it, under criticism by industry.

Parity in conditions therefore essential.

Ch.Sec. Tr. Cm. Service, as separate service, goes : and members can move into Dip.S. Therefore no ques. of discrimn. between services.

S/S.ITRD. But there will be between individuals.

Ch.Sec. But allce. is for career officer, not for short-term secondment officer.

See para 575. Can‟t publish this – and ignore it.

And concession cdn‟t be confined to secondments from one Dept. alone: but extension v. expensive. [8000 in all : mainly M.P.B.W.]

S/S.ITRD. Other Depts. not comparable. Com. Secy. is full member of Embassy : others aren‟t.

M.W.P.(C) I support S/S.ITRD. An endless source of friction.

M.Edn. And para 575, tho‟ positive, is not argued.

Ch.Sec. If to be reopened, must also re-examine allces. designed specially to benefit seconded.

S/S.ITRD. May have been intended as inducement to join D.S. But won‟t necessarily work that way.

M.P. And value in H.C. Servants who have served abroad.

P.M. F.S., Ch. Sec., S/S.ITRD., L.P., M. Lab to reconsider. [?And M.P.B.W.]

L.P.S. ? Interval between publicn. and decision announcement – for public opinion.

F.S. Earliest publicn. date is 20 Feb. Before then must inform C.w. Govts. and staff unions.

[Exit M.H.

S/S.ITRD. Col. Service is admve. service. How combinn. with represl. service?

C.S. On voluntary basis.

P.M. Develop policy planning.

F.S. Shorter statement. Publish with report: but defer publicn. till time for C.w. Govts. &amp; Staff Unions have been informed.

P.M. Agree : suggns for statement amdt. to me.
