C.M.(64)4 15 January 1964. 9.30 a.m.

1. Resale Price Maintenance. (resumed)

[Enter Ch.Whip : Att.Gen.

L.Ch. Comprehensive draft statement (circulated).

a) Hitherto have kept reference to M.C. in own hands. Now to transfer this to M.C. This will alarm industry : and it abdicates Govt. responsy.

b) Mergers. Companies will not know where they stand until enquiry complete. This will retard devt.

c) Power to break up mergers &amp; monopolies v. doubtful. Can it be done: cf our experience in denationalising steel. Only way may be compulsory liquidation: how do you do this to ICI.?

S/S.ITRD. My intentions known to E.P.C. for some time : and Poole‟s cttee. went further than is now proposed. Hitherto no agreement at E.P.C. : but Cab. must now decide. M.C. must be given new and indeptt. status and authority; and Govt. shd. have power, in last resort, to dismantle mergers &amp; monopolies.

Industry will accept this : and changed public opinion will support it.

Ch.Exch. ?Omit some of the contentious issues and concentrate on r.p.m.

M.D. To announce M.C. to be given wide remit on own initiative, without refce. to Ministers wd. be more controversial than r.p.m. proposals. U.S precedent may be applicable: but may not. Study further before deciding.

Ch.D. Poole also doubts whether machinery on mergers yet ready.

Att.Gen. Dissolving a well established merger v. difficult. Neither we nor U.S. succeeded in dissolving Krupps. Not merely physical assets, but also r. &amp; d. resources etc.

Ch.Exch. And prior applicn. for permission to merge wd. lead to Stock Exchange specn. on appalling scale.

M.H. If we take powers to deal with monopolies, why do we need different powers to deal with mergers?

L.Ch. I agree: be general at this stage &amp; leave details for subsequent W.P.

P.M. Agree: para 6 to stop at “groups” and second sentences of paras 7 and 11 to be omitted. Then intensive study for W.P.

Ch.Exch. to help S/S.ITRD.

Ch.Exch. A merger is only dangerous if it creates a monopoly; and then it becomes a proper subject for M.C.

H.S. But public opinion will not be content to wait until merger has taken place before enquiry.

P.M. No point in any refce. to taking powers to investigate mergers unless we can use them to unscramble bad ones. Can we?

M.D. V. doubtful. And U.S. precedent suggests that only result is to preserve good mergers.

M.A.F.F. To decide whether merger is bad is one thing. To break it up is another. Either we do it in advance – frightful muddle: or we do it afterwards – all the difficulties of unscrambling.

M.D. Altve. formula.

P.M. S/S.ITRD : L.P. : L.Ch. : M.D. : M.H. to consider.

On para 15 (r.p.m.) insert at end of 3rd sentence “unless this is proved to be wrong before a judicial tribunal”.

S/S.ITRD. This means a 6 month period in wh. any firm cd. lodge plea.

Any pleas not lodged fall. Those lodged wd. be grouped; timing of presentation to R.P. Court (wh. wd. have to be enlarged) wd. remain in our hands. (Legn. needed to enlarge Court) but as part of legn. needed for main purpose.

L.Ch. “Illegal”. Not settled whether this means a criminal offence or an abuse remediable by civil procedure.

L.P.S. This para v. damaging to Party : disastrous impact on small man.

M.D,. But this is better than outright abolition.

Ch.D. Even so, a large storm.

Ch.S. And unnecessarily menacing phraseology.

S/S.ITRD. But process will take several years, unless int??? arg. works.

[Exeunt P.M. &amp; F.S.

L.P. Redraft : agreed. Books &amp; tobacco will have to apply.

L.Ch. Drafting of legn. shd. be put in hand urgently, with support of specialist committee (including lawyers) to advise.

L.P. Revert to para 13 : services.

M.T. U.S. have these powers and are using them, qua shipping, v. objectionably.

L.Ch. But because they are seeking to use powers outside their jurisdiction.

We shall keep it within our own jurisdiction.

M.T. This must be made clear.

Ch.S. “Commercial” services. If industrial as well, what about trades unions?

S/S.ITRD. Will consider.

Informn. agrts. to be at discretion of Registrar.
