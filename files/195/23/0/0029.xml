C.M.(64)1 3 January 1964. 11.30 a.m.

1. Cyprus. (oral) [Enter 3 Service Ministers : M. Av.n. :

C.I.G.S. (vice C.D.S.)

C.Sec. My visit to C. Establishment of liaison cttee : worked well in lowering temperature.

First task to make case fire effective by neutralising line – U.K. cordon sanitaire. Second task to exchange hostages. Both done.

Must now turn to political soln. – under threat of withdrawal to bases.

Makarios has accepted, reluctantly, proposal for confce. of 3 Guarantor Powers, after retracting decln. of revocation of Treaty.

Main confce. shd. be of 3 G.P.‟s with both C. communities : main work to be done by working party of both comms. under Br. chairman, reporting to confce.

Shd. take place quickly, if we are to get out without discredit: try for before end of next week. Sitn. still v. precarious.

U.N. Repve. of S.Gen. in Cyprus useful : but not observers, who wd. be a military embarrassment (tho‟ U.N. troops later on might be needed).

M.W.P.(C) We have made this proposal to G. &amp; T. Govts. – a) to protect us politically in U.K.; b) because U.N. already saying we are acting from Imperialist motives; c) because sitn. still so precarious that serious incident wd. be less embarrassing if U.N. repve. there.

G. &amp; T. Govts. have accepted. Shd. therefore announce with them that we intend to make this request to U.N. subject to agt. of Govt. of C. Also ask for meeting of Secy. Council, to anticipate pressure for this wh. will develop in any case. Meeting wd. be to report what we have done.

P.M. Confce : not optimistic. But only chance.

U.N.: dangerous since we can‟t control what they do. But if inevitable, anticipate. Observer (i.e. repve. shd. simply be there, with no defined role.

C.S. Might be present at confce. : but in same role.

M.W.P.(C) I wdn‟t accept this.

L.P.S. Partition may be unavoidable.

C.S. Constn. doesn‟t work: too extensive T veto. But T. don‟t want partition; and G. don‟t want enosis. Real desire for new understanding – based on greater secy. for T. at expense of their rigid veto. Therefore T. of R. of confce. must be vague – see formula.

P.M. We have taken on a lot. If C.S. chairs confce., invidious to press soln. if it goes against T. (e.g. if they had to withdraw to Mainland T) ?altve. chairman nominated by U.K.

No : C.S. must do it, recognising it may fail. Arrangements to be made as quickly as poss.

On U.N. accept repve. of S.Gen. in Island. More doubtful whether we shd. raise in Secy. C. on Monday. May get out of control – despite promise of U.S. support : blocking ⅓rd.

L.Ch. It will get there anyhow : therefore anticipate this.

C.S. I agree – provided quickly, while we have a good story to tell.

P.M. Important to ask for repve. before S.C. meeting : otherwise S.C. will suggest something else.

M.W.P.(C) Secy. Gen. will send repve. only if Govt. of C. request.

C.S. There isn‟t a C. Govt.- in T. eyes. But M. &amp; k. wd. agree on this.

L.P. Russians will still take line that we have no right to be in C. But we shd. still be right to take initiative.

M.H. But it will give G. &amp; T. Govts. chance to take up posns. wh. may be embarrassing.

M.W.P.(C) But sitn. may deteriorate again. If so, somebody will take it to S.C. and our posn. will be weaker.

L.P. Then confine ourselves to reporting action taken to S.C.

L.P.S. Do this without a meeting at all?

C.S. Meeting wd. give M. chance to revive plea for revocation of Treaty.

This is what he will propose to Gen. Assy. in due course.

Therefore report without a meeting.

P.M. Put in a report : M.W.P.(C) to discuss with F.S. &amp; C.S. whether a meeting also.

A successful meeting wd. be best of all. But a meeting leading to a row or frustrating confce. in advance wd. be v. dangerous.

Therefore subject to F.S.‟s views, report on Monday wd. be right.

Request for repve. of S. Gen. to be put forward at once, in names of Gk. and T. Govts. &amp; ourselves, to keep S. Gen. informed of devts.

Arrangements for briefing Press agreed. Avoid any suggn. we are short of troops (anywhere).

C.S. Tribute to H. Cmr. and Gen. Young. Beware of our taking any more responsy. – particularly as regards taking over police.

Liaison officer between H. Cmr. and General Y. to be appointed to strengthen former‟s political control over latter. V. risky if Br. troops

have to shoot or are killed. Public opinion wd. not stand this for long.

P.M. Must then be prepared to withdraw to S.B.A.‟s.

C.S. No immediate risk. Br. troops welcomed everywhere.
