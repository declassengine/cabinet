C.C.(63)59 8 October 1963. 10.a.m.

1. Kenya. (oral) [Enter Ch.Whip.

Col.Secy. Deadlock persists. If maintain present constn., KANU wd declare

intention to destroy after indepce.. Will try to narrow differences : but difficult to restrain KADU from violence and Eur. rights must be safeguarded.

Any riots shd be containable. Therefore go forward and try some modificn. in favour of KANU even at some risk of trouble with KADU.

KANU may destroy even this : but not at outset.

Concessions to KANU might be in respect of i) centralising and co-ordinating 8 public services into one, wh wd be at service of regions but centrally controlled. ii) Easing powers of police. Merits are all in favour of these amdts. But tribal emotions are against them in regions.

2. The Robbins Report. C.(63)175 &amp; 173 [Enter M.Avn. M/S. Sco.O

First Secy. My cttee envisaged that: a)R. gives us a good report on past

b)we can cope with proposals for 10 years.

Therefore endorse paras 1-8 : leave paras 9-14 (and paras 15-17) for further considn. This will be major advance in Educl. policy.

Ch.Secy. I agree – see my memo. Accept practical steps in paras 1-8 to cope with “bulge”. Leave rest for interested parties (e.g. Arts Council) to comment.

Extra cost (para 19). v. large. Implies priority for educn. As in 1944.

L.P. Accept – but regret – no commitment yet to My. of Higher Educn. etc.

In its absence, my task is v. difficult. No real point in delay since it will have to be done.

M.Edn. No : public opinion must pronounce on machinery of govt. proposals.

Addl. complicn. of Scotland.

On finance, bulge will be aggravated by doubling of numbers in 6th forms.

Will do my best to accommodate cost within my allocn. : but priority is limited to £15m.: does not imply that higher educn. as a whole has priority over ordinary educn, industrial training etc.

P.M. Don‟t wait for debate. Welcome report in statement as soon as published &amp; promise Parly. debate. First Secy. to have Press Confce.

Publish civil service report : L.P. to give it the same treatment.

M. Edn. to consult Ch. Secy., subject to approval of First Secy. on any advance release of Robbins.

[Exit M. Avn.

3. New Trials in Criminal Cases. C.(63)168

[Enter Att. Gen.

Home Sec. “Lucky” Gordon case underlines Tucker report. HAC recommends legn. for new trial where new evidence : majority favour next Session.

Att.Gen. Will be controversial and should go further. Few cases of fresh evidence and does not cover cases where evidence was wrongly excluded. But better than nothing.

L.Ch. L.C.J. wd. like to go whole way. But arg. about not being imperilled twice wd. be advanced. Therefore do limited step which is right.

Mention in Q. Speech.

Ch.Duchy. Legve. programme now heavy. Therefore don‟t mention in Speech, but introduce legn. if possible.

M/S. Scot. Power exists in Scotland: no change needed.

P.M. Draft Bill: reconsider inclusion in Q. Speech when final draft available.

M.Def. Even merits doubtful!

L.Ch. No : essential.

P.M. As I said.

4. Compensation for Victims of Crimes of Violence.

C.(63)179 [Enter M.P.N.I.

Home Sec. Action desirable : but “court” or ex gratia. “Court” preferable : or ex gratia experimentally. But discretionary nature of ex gratia, and absence of any right of appeal objectionable : and no means of pressure on offender.

Ch.Secy. “Court” too elaborate: and implies State has duty to protect not only persons but also property.

Ex gratia easier to introduce: and can move later to court scheme.

Reverse not possible.

L.Ch. I agree. Victim of criminal act has no right of redress at expense of State. Also, courts must act on evidence: but Home Sec. will often have no evidence. Therefore no protection against fraudulent claims.

Virtue of ex gratia is experimental nature, as Ch. Secy. says.

Home Sec. Trustees will be equally vulnerable to fraudulent claims. If they reject one, how can Home Secy. defend them in Parlt.

M.H. I agree with L. Ch. This must be compassion, not admission of

liability.

L.P.S. No : ex gratia assessment is always contentious. Public trust counts.

M.N.P.I. Start with ex gratia. But not my responsy. : it is for Home Secy.

Ch.Duchy. I agree.

Home Secy. Can I say at Party Confce. that a statement will be made early in Session?

P.M. Yes.

[Exit Att.Gen.

5. Rates. (C.(63)167&amp;172 resumed) [Enter M.Transport.

M.H.L.G. Scots objection: can be met if formula devised to deal with discretionary element by giving, in Scotland, less weight to revaln. and more to mere increase.

M/S.Scot. Not sure : better to liberalise definition of hardship.

Ch.Secy. But Scots defn. already more liberal than M.H.L.G.‟s formula. Must consider further.

M.H.L.G. Increase in general grant to be made (without using police grant).

But since indiscriminate, v. expensive way of giving selective help.

Bournemouth, Blackpool etc. defensible : not at v. bottom of table : and amounts paid by their ratepayers are 50% above E. &amp; W. average.

Ch.Duchy. Do accept M.H.L.G. plan.

Com.Secy. I agree.

M.H. No : a slippery slope. We shall get no credit and regret it.

Deliberate favouritism in election year, with Allen sitting, is immoral

Ch.Secy. Not immoral to relieve where shoe pinches, particularly if explicitly subject to Allen and our own review.

M.W.P. But areas excluded will have grievance.

M.H.L.G. Relief will apply to anybody, anywhere, who can establish hardship, local authority being judge, and criterion being whether rate increase compels a change of life or move of residence. And all explicitly interim, pending Allen.

P.B.T. I support it.

F.S. But how assess hardship without causing grievance?

M.H.L.G. Remember two preliminary hurdles – both absolute and relate “jumps”.

Home Sec. I agree – on political grounds.

M/S. Scot. Scots Act says “poverty”, not hardship. Let anybody appeal on these grounds : L.Ay. to grant rate relief : Tsy. to pay half.

L.Ch. No: too precise. I support M.H.L.G.

M.H. Relief from taxn. shd. be impartial &amp; universal. a) &amp; b) do not measure up to this; c) only v. indirectly. They are more experience and will be resented by those who do not benefit.

P.M. On balance, approve proposals : M.H.L.G. to consult L.A.‟s privately.

[Exit M.P.N.I.

At this point the Prime Minister made a personal statement to the Cabinet

(which is not recorded) and left the meeting.

6. Housing Programme. (oral) [Enter M.P.B.W :

re-enter M/S. Scot.

M.H.L.G. Announce 400,000 target at Party Conference “in due course”.

Ch.Secy. If no date, achievement in any year will be measured against it.

Robbins and other proposals will be competing.

Therefore say we will beat 350,000 rather than that we will attain 400.000.

M.H.L.G. But we have no date for 350,300. And target is important for training purposes etc.

M.H. But 400,000 isn‟t till 1970 – the Parliament after next! No credit here.

L.P. But same argument applies to university expansion.

[Exit F.S. : Ch.Duchy.

Ch.Secy. Only as result of deliberate decision on priorities.

M.P.B.W. I support M.H.L.G. Announcement essential to promote reorgn. of construction industry.

Home Sec. I agree : we must pre-empt politically something which is going to happen anyhow.

[Re-enter F.S.

Ch.Exch. Present as result of better methods and productivity rather than allocn. of more resources.

[Exit M.P.B.W.

First Secy. Agree.

7. Postal Voting. (oral)

Home Sec. Pressure for extension wh. wd have to be comprehensive, not merely for holidays. Ch.Duchy wd like us to say that we will discuss extension with other Parties. Labour Party will oppose holiday category, since this wd. be to our advantage.

It will create more work : it is not secret and it reduces idea of personal responsibility implicit in attending polling station.

M.W.P. What grounds for changing our opposition two years ago?

L.Ch. If people want it, let them have it. And let Labour Party have odium of opposing facility for holiday makers.

M.H. No: we must not appear to favour something which is notoriously in our favour.

M.A.F.F. I agree. V. dangerous politically.

First Secy. Oppose resn.: if it is carried, we can‟t help it. [Exit Home Sec.

Channel Tunnel. C.(63)166

M.T. Urgent to reach decision – a) because of modn. of ports etc. b) because de G. has now said that he favours it.

First Secy. Ch. Duchy won‟t commit us to debate. M.T. to discuss with him.

M.H.L.G. Let decision on project be quick.

First Secy. Let it come forward for discussn. in November.
