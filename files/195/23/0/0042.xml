C.M.(64)14 25 February 1964. 11 a.m.

1. Diplomatic Service Allowance. C.P.(64)9

M.W.P.(C) R.A.B. v. opposed to S/S.ITRD : also Plowden &amp; Harcourt : and Henderson wd. take chance to re-open package deal on e.g boarding school allowances.

B/T. officers will now get 100%, not 90% of F.O. remunn. : and large extra outfitting allce, over F.O. entitlement. Only £150 p.a. involved at 1st Secy. level.

S/S.ITRD. P. Cttee. makes F. Service exclusive among those serving o‟seas. Bad : and uneconomic when F.S. short of people and B/T. officers are urgently needed for export reasons.

Financial difference can be v. large. Examples.

And justification weak – special factors just as liable to affect seconded B/T officers as career F.S. officers. Real reason is P. Cttee.‟s desire to give latter tax free allce. wh. they cdn‟t get at home.

P.M. But real distincn. between life career abroad and liability to be sent abroad for periods.

M.Lab. I wd. defend this distincn. in relation to Labour Attachés.

M.W.P.(C) Wd. Tsy. adjust other allces. to help?

S.S.ITRD. Doesn‟t meet point of discrimn. between two officers serving together in same post o‟seas.

L.Ch. Agree : difference is one of quantum, not principle.

M.Power. And it wd. rigidify Home/O‟seas services distincn. and deter volunteers to serve as D Cmrs.

M.P.B.W. I wdn‟t claim parity for my people. But they ought to get more than is proposed.

P.M. Best to supplement other allces, but preserve Plowden principle.

Ch. Sec. to discuss with S/S.ITRD.

M.Edn. But beware of endless upward cycle of adjustments to keep F.S. ahead, if we narrow gap too much.

P.M. As I said, Accept Plowden, but reduce discrepancy.

2. Southern Rhodesia. (oral)

P.M. Circulate draft Speech from Rivers W.F. has omitted second para : we have offered further discussns. Even so W.F. may say it in Debate. Must therefore decide counter tactics. We don‟t favour faster advance:

but can‟t concede indepce. as is without wrecking C‟wealth. Offer help for educn. (with U.S. &amp; other assistance?) to accelerate eligibility for A.Roll by Africans.

Invoke Judicial Cttee. – S.Rh. Govt. pledging selves to accept its ruling on constl. changes.

L.Ch. If W.F. says para 2, posn. serious.

C.S. Less so than if Govr. said it.

P.M. We must say we don‟t regard it as unill. decln. of indepce. and understand that W.F. doesn‟t either.

C.S. May even be helpful, if he finds this enough and doesn‟t go further. I have mobilised Old C‟w. Govts. against him : they have reacted well and my message has reinforced them. I have made it clear that link with Crown wd. not survive expulsion from C‟w.

Have also got two Consve. M.P.‟s to visit Salisbury, to spread right gospel.

We may yet hold W.F. But if not must persuade him to make formal statement outside Parlt. If not, we may introduce regn,. or even Bill, in Parlt. : and Bill wd. require Governor‟s assent – i.e. wd. challenge Crown in Parlt. here. I have alerted Govr. to dangers of his posn; he is appointed by Queen on my advice – after consultn, but not agreement, with S. Rh. Govt. – and holds office at pleasure.

Can therefore be terminated by Queen on our advice.

Appears little chance of compromise. W.F.‟s proposals inadequate, including universal suffrage to African on B. Roll (without increasing number of seats), abolition of cross voting (wh. wd. eliminate A. influence on A. Roll), and introdn. of few wealthy A. farmers on A. Roll. Aboln. of discrimn. qualified by reservn. on Land Appt. Act. (wh. Constl. C. have condemned); and pace v. slow – slower than Whitehead envisaged.

Must consider subsidy for educn. At present, A. majority on A. Roll comes in 15 yrs. Might reduce this to 10 yrs. but this wdn‟t satisfy Africans. Must therefore adopt timetable with date for A. majority on A. Roll and date for indepce. – not at once.

L.Ch. Odds heavily against us : but must try for negotd. settlement.

Must also be ready for deadlock. Govt. hold office at pleasure, as well as Governor, and any unconstl. act (whether Bill or only regn.) wd. provide grounds for dismissing them. We cdn‟t ignore it, without being suspected of conniving and acquiescing. Dismissal could be done by Queen on advice of our Ministers : doubtful if by Govr.-

If they rejected it, they cd not purport to be loyal to Queen. They wd. be in revolt. Govr. wd. have to send for E.W. to form govt. : he cdn‟t (since in minority) and wd. therefore have to ask for dissn. 4 months

between dissn. &amp; election – time for second thoughts. W.R. might win : if so, we shd. be better placed to acquiesce in indepce., since we shd. have taken all poss. action and election wd. have made S. Rh. wishes clear.

P.M. Must have Minl. Cttee. to consult all aspects. No real risk for a few days : but must be ready thereafter.

S. Rh. rapidly becoming non racial. Different from S.A. and must not go same way. Constl. envisages majority rule. But when?

And wd. they observe constn. after indepce.? Wd. my proposals help to create special relationship between S. Rh. and U.K. (with other members of C‟w?) All suggns. for this purpose welcomed.

L.Ch. J. Cttee doubtful : not a justiciable issue. A. C‟w. tribunal?

L.P. But not compatible with indepce, even tho‟ they wd. be indeptt. of U.K. Must try to hold W.F. : but don‟t buy him off.

And don‟t hurry : we must be prepared to put up with a lot from W.F. rather than drive him to extreme courses. They aren‟t indept. and aren‟t going to be for some time.

Ch.Exch. J. Cttee. idea worth pursuing.?

C.S. No : they don‟t want to change constn.

I agree with L.P. Must go slowly, avoiding indepce. Might do a lot by simply ignoring them. Great diffce. between speech or repn. and act by Govr. wh. challenged authority of Parlt. in London. Govr. cd. then be dismissed.

W.F. won‟t rush – because the only powers they haven‟t got are the ones – intl. status and respresl etc. wh illegal indepce. wdn‟t give them.

L.Ch. Can‟t draw clear line between conduct of Govr. and conduct of Ministers. If a Bill, can‟t wait till Govr. asked for assent. Even if only a resn. may have to act at once – by dismissing Ministers.

L.P. Be careful. No precedent for this ; and beware of creating one.

Confine action to Govr!

M.Edn. Watch risk of African èmgré Govt. in N. Rh. W.F. cd. not win against this threat.

P.M. Yes : but we are saying to them that they alone in Africa will not be indept. for 15 yrs. If so, must somehow give them some special status and relationship with U.K. and rest of C‟w.

Ch.Sec. Must restrain N. Rh. from any intemperate reaction. Don‟t endanger the mutual agts. on Kariba etc.

P.M. Cttee. as proposed : add M. Edn. L. Ch. to consult Law Officers.

3. Road &amp; Rail Transport. C.P.(64)50

Ch.Duchy. As in memm.

L.Ch. Rural buses. Can‟t go on like this any longer.

M.T. Am sending P.M. proposals today. Only relevant where no rail services in existence and therefore no question of closures.

P.M. Wd. be timely to announce at same time as rail Press Confce. Consult M.W.P.(D)

Also odd to delay announcement about lines north of Inverness until June. Will pursue separately.

Will consider whether rural buses proposals shd. be considered collectively.

4. Law of Sea. (oral)

L.Ch. Two problems arise from confce. :

a) Norway : until 1970 we can fish in 6-12 m. band. Convention will give rights therefore perpetuity in some band around U.K. Norway, Denmark and Iceland won‟t sign – because of reciprocity. Last two won‟t sign : Norway wants to, with right to terminate in 1974, but will also extend right of fishing from 1970 to 1974. Majority of cttee. oppose this because :-

i) middle &amp; distant watch fleet wd. be critical of a bad bargain.

ii) wd. rule out chance of any N. relaxn. in return for trade concessions in future and so stultify purpose of confce.

F.O. wd. sign and concede point to N. in order to avoid offending N. in other intl. contexts (Secy. Council etc.)

P.M. Consider separately in smaller group.

5. Polaris Submarine Programme. (oral) [Enter F.L.A. &amp;

M. Avn.

P.M. 4 credible? No : a) refitting programme puts one out of action for some time : and risk of accident.

b) France will have 5.

c) nuclear “freeze” means our deterrent must be credible.

Another £70 m : Ch. Exch. opposes unless economies. If M. Def. can produce them, do Lab. approve 5th Sub.?

M.D. Military args. for 5th overwhelming. Economies cd. be found: discuss between Tsy. and M. Def.

Ch.Exch. I doubt if they are real : and expre. is always coming forward from 70‟s to late 60‟s, wh. is heaviest period.

M.D. Must decide £11 m. for U.S. items by end of month. Peak is 1967-68.

Refit argument recent and powerful.

Ch.Exch. Too sudden a reversal. And other proposals – e.g. S/V. replacement – are accelerating expre. in 1967-68.

M.D. Agree must keep within ceiling : but how we spend within it is matter of military judgment. Describe economies wh. Ch. of S. wd. now accept.

P.M. Can‟t risk 4 being exposed as not credible. But economies must be made. Machinery without hulls pointless. Discuss.
