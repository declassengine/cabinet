C.M.(63)7 21 November 1963. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip.

L.P.S. As in statement.

2. Security. (oral)

P.M. McM. proposal on Secy. Cmn. ?Revive.

L.Ch. Might give Oppn. fresh grounds for alleging judiciary improperly employed by executive.

H.S. But vulnerable if not revived.

P.M. Will do so, without commitment – and without Cttee. of P. Councillors.

3. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Iraq

F.S. Army now in control: but sitn. obscure and no question of recognition of new authority.

b) Berlin

F.S. Fr. convoys have got through. Sitn. quiet : but shd. consider non-military measures if further trouble.

No evidence Fr. being deliberately provocative.

P.M. Counter-measures risky: but, if confined to Berlin impasse, can be examined.

c) N.A.T.O.

S.S.I.T.R.D. N.A.T.O. discussion on credit for S.U. inconclusive : to be revived at meeting of Foreign Ministers in December : but may be buried indefinitely. U.S. probably not anxious to force confrontation with us.

d) S.Africa

F.S. U.N. debate going as hoped : compromise resn. may survive.

4. Kenya : Land Settlement. C.P.(63)18 &amp; 19

Col. Sec Disappointing: but inevitable. Particularly urgent to central regions, where Kikuyu are pressing in on Eur. areas. Latter may throw up sponge : or, if they resist, violence may develop.

Our schemes not really intended to help Africans but to protect Eur. interests; this now wearing thin.

Therefore complete 1 m. acre scheme &amp; then review early next year

with willingness to contemplate large extension (wh. we need not settle now.)

P.M. Dangerous procedure if, as soon as Africans press, we pay: better to advance whole review.

Col. Sec. Wd. take too long. Leave to see if necy. after indepce. : concentrate on immediate problem.

Ch. Sec. 1 m. acre scheme was overtly intended to help Africans. Present proposals wd. depart from this – and wd. be v. expensive: £3 m. for 110 farmers, wh. is v. high compensn. for constl. change (wh. we have always refused in principle).

Therefore let scheme continue and review in due course.

Financial discussns. due in any event : don‟t anticipate.

Special concession to old and infirm (?£600,000) was said to satisfy Eurs. Why, then, this large new commitment?

Col.Sec. Because sitn. has deteriorated : prospect for mixed farmers now v. uncertain.

Ch.Exch. V. arguable. Must not accept open compensn. for Eurs.

Col.Sec. But purpose remains to provide land for Africans.

P.M. ? advance review and deal with this area as first item.

M.Def. If sitn. deteriorates, chances of rescuing Eurs. by military means not bright. Therefore advance review – tho‟ it may be even more expensive than dealing only with central area now.

L.Ch. ? Repercussions in S.Rh..

Col.Sec. But Eurs. in S.Rh. want indepce. Eurs. in K. don‟t.

Agree with M. Def. on unwisdom of advancing review.

Ch.Secy. Only if compensn. for Eurs. is conceded in principle.

And must combine with other finl. discussions.

Col.Sec. K. Govt. won‟t give it any priority in that context.

[Absent for brief interval.]

P.M. ?Col. Sec. to say that we recognise need for more land for Afr. settlement and therefore propose to make (unspecified) provision in forthcoming financial settlement connected with indepce.

Col.Sec. Must mention the 350.000 acres: can omit the money. But must act now. Intervenn. of Br. troops after indepce. wd. be disastrous.

This is not compensn.: merely an extension of procedure already agreed for this area.

SSITRD But annex shows that settlement of 12,000 unsettles 25,000!

Ch.Exch. Because break up of large holdings does displace Africans!

P.M. Col. Sec. &amp; Ch. Sec. to devise formula on basis of further purchase in central region for African settlement.

Ch.Sec. And link with indepce. finl. settlement.

Col.Sec. No : once indept., they will be pressing us. If this is combined I must press.

Ch.Sec. But if we settle separately, it will prove to be extra to indepce. settlement.

P.M. See how far formula can link the two things. Consider this p.m.

L.Ch. If compensn. cd. it be confined to Br. and exclude e.g. S. Africans.

[Exit Col.Sec.

5. Long Term problems of traffic in towns. C.P.(63)12

M.T. Circulated revised version of statement.

M.Def. No statement at all?

Home Sec. Must be one – to reconcile Beeching and C.- B.

M.W.P. Agree. Have had report for months : can‟t say nothing.

P.M. Abbreviate : and have Press Confce. M.T,. : M.W.P. (D) : M.H.L.G. to redraft.

L.P.S. Agree : but preserve last sentence of para 9.

6. Chalgrove Airfield. C.P.(63)16. [Enter S/S Air : Att.Gen:

Parly Sec. M.Avn.

Home Sec. As in memm. Sale prevents binding of successors : therefore adopt 999 year lease with no breaks in favour of Govt. and with guarantee of full market value if he ceases to make e.g. equipment.

L.Ch. I agree. Draft letter shd. make even clearer that it gives him what he wants and does not require him to concede more than he has already conceded.

S/S Air. We promised to sell : and no safeguard can bind either successor

Govt. or successor company in order to protect former owners.

M. may refuse lease and publish our letter offering sale. May also cease mftre. of e.g. equipment.

L.Ch. But offer of sale was conditional on assurances. Now established that this is only way in wh. they can be put into effect.

P.M. A.M. ltr. of 24/7/59 explicit offer of sale.

M.H. But in 1960 equally explicit undertaking to former owners.

L.Ch. And this is only way assurances can be made effective.

But amend text of letter.

P.M. Shall I see him first?

M.Def. Must write: but add offer of interview.

P.M. ?See him, and, if he reacts well, offer to put in writing.

If he reacts badly, must sell?

M.Def. No: must not put ourself in posn. in wh. we can‟t effect C.Down policy.

P.M. I will see him : if he reacts badly, must reconsider.

L.Ch. to redraft letter.

L.Ch. &amp; M.Def. to be present at interview.

M.Def. to submit draft letter of invitation – including anybody M. wants to bring with him.

[Exit F.S : S/S Air : Att.Gen :

Parly Sec. M.Avn.

7. Pensions. C.P.(63)15 [Enter M.P.N.I.

M.P.N.I. As in memm. : considerable objections to proposal. Therefore choice is between doing nothing and amending earnings rule.

M.Edn. Cd. extend allces. to end of 18th school year : but selective.

M.P.N.I. Any wholesale modifn. of benefits scheme on selective basis will take some time.

M.Lab. Need we concede anything to small pressure group? Exposes us to “spending spree” charge : and case on merits weak.

M.P.B.W. Abolish all 3 earnings‟ rules?

Ch.Secy. The opposite of greater selectivity related to need!

M.H.L.G. Much better to do something on educl. front by raising allce. of children of widowed mothers. Consider whether up to 18 or even beyond.

M.Edn. Will consider – even through univy. or apprenticeships stage.

Maintenance allce. proposal no use: L.E.A.‟s too touchy at this moment.

M.P.M. Wd. this be in my field?

Ch.Sec. If so, wd. help to carry w.m.‟s over 50 yr. point, at wh. they become entitled to w. pensions.

L.Ch. Requires legn. : scope for amdt.

Ch.Secy. If tied to chn. might be able to limit debate.

Ch.Whip. Considerable political steam in this. Alteration in earnings rule is selective: good thing in election year.

L.Ch. Better to do chn. rather than something for only those widows who are earning.

Ch.Whip. Doubtful if wd. satisfy political pressure.

P.M. M.P.N.I. &amp; M. Edn. to consider it. If necy., must abolish earnings rule.

Scope for amdt. on more limited proposal shd. be made clear.
