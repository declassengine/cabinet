C.C.(63)51 1 August 1963. 10.30 a.m.

[Enter Ch.Whip : M.P.N.I. : Parly Sec. C.R.O.

1. Service Widows‟ Pensions (oral)

P.M. Since last Cab. discussn., I have received deputn. V. strong feeling : pressure is going to be mobilised. ?Concede now. Repercussions exaggerated. Cost only £200.000.

Ch.Exch. Repercussions not exaggerated.

Ch.Sec. Can‟t isolate this group of occupational (not injury) pensioners. And dangerous to alter basis of award for one group. O.R.‟s widows became entitled from same date : but those before that date have no pension. Oppn. aware of what retrospection wd imply. In addn. officers themselves wd. have corresponding claim. This year‟s P.I. measure contained an extra £20 for over 70‟s, as an annual addition, to meet the pre ‟58 widows‟.

P.M. Very well. Leave to Ch. Sec‟s Cttee. to examine further.

M.Def. We cd. do this without repercussions. Silly to resist for sake of £200.000.

Better not to do it – as we shall – under pressure.

Com.Sec. I agree.

M.W.P. Pressure is coming anyhow : concession here wd. take its sting away at the outset.

M.Edn. But beware of pre 1949 C.S. widows, who have no pensions.

P.M. Must settle in Sept. before Party Confce. Meanwhile, stall.

[Exit M.P.N.I.

2. Construction Industry. (oral)

M.Lab. Employers and unions have reached deadlock. Critical date 14 Aug.

Thereafter risk of ban on overtime and strikes at selected sites.

W.P. Cttee. to consider again tomorrow.

Ch.Exch. Unions‟ demands excessive : and they can take advantage of sitn. in which we are deliberately stimulating investment.

P.M. Beware of starting new infly. cycle.

3. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) United Nations and Colonialism.

F.S. Portuguese Resn. typical. Starts with extreme African resn proposal to amend by U.S. (in order not to be merely negative) : then moderate resnS. in parallel (in case amended resn. fails) : then pressures to stiffen mod. resn. in order to ensure its passage.

Thus constant pressure to accept, at v. short notice, a bad recn. in order to avoid a worse one.

We managed to abstain on P. resn. with U.S.A. But if it had been accepted, we shd. either have been forced to veto a U.S. resn. or have had to accept a resn., wh. have been a damaging precedent for S. Africa. Rhodesia &amp; Br. Guiana. As it is P. resn. is mandatory on us.

Posn. v. unsatisfy.

P.M. Yes. U.S. ambivalent. Kennedy a practical realist : but others are 19th century liberals, whom the Administration jettisons at last moment.

4. Commonwealth &amp; Colonial Affairs. (oral)

a) Malta.

Com. Sec. Confce. v. difficult. If confce. breaks down to-day, shall offer indepce. by May 1964.

b) Zanzibar.

Confce. for indepce. at same time as Kenya.

c) Br. Guiana.

No new racial violence. May have to impose soln. at discussion with Party leaders in Sept.

d) Little Seven.

Must discuss with them (doubtful) possy. of indepce. in ‟65, if Fedn. in existence by then.

e) Malaysia.

Tunku has asked U. Thant how long he wd. take to ascertain wishes of people in N.B. and Sarowak. If some time, he may offer token postponement by one week. A slippery slope.

We have warned him against postponement.

f) India.

I-P-China sitn. v. delicate.

Com.Sec. China more active : but no sign of real threat.

Ayub‟s political posn. weak : extremist anti Indians getting in control.

Risk of P. combining with Ch. and occupying K. U.S. guarantee of each country against the other may restrain them. But v. difficult.

[Exit Com.Sec.

5. Finance for U.N. in Congo. (C.(63)145.

F.Sec. Two problems:-

a) financing of U.N. civil &amp; tech. opns. for rest of ‟63. U.N. want us to contribute another $1 m. : P. Dean says $½ m. wd. suffice.

b) security operations in Katanga may require at least 3000 U.N. troops till mid ‟64, by when Belgians may have trained enough Congolese troops to maintain order, otherwise renewed civil war.

We must agree $2.9 m. (out of total of $33 m.) to our share of 8000 troops until end of ‟63. For first six months of ‟64, our share wd. be $1.1 m, on basis of 3000 troops.

Ch.Sec. Accept $½ m. under a). Ditto for b) – tho‟ may be politically controversial.

L.P. But Katanga was supposed to contribute.

F.S. She is too far in the red. We must help : but whole opn. may fail.

P.M. Agree.

6. Policy towards S. Africa. C.(63)146 [Enter M.Avn.

F.S. Agreed with U.S. to veto resns. to expel S.A. from U.N. or to impose economic sanctions. Afro-Asians therefore concentrating on embargo on all arms for S.A.

U.S. will try to amend this. Norway might co-operate, exempting arms appropriate only for defence against external aggression. V. near our current practice. But can we accept “only” ? What about e.g. tanks?

Or spares and ammn. for tanks? Or helicopters?

x/ Must stipulate exemption for existing contracts and spares for weapons already supplied. Resn., if passed, would be mandatory.

P.M. Buccaneers are for external aggression.

M.Def. Accept as at x ? – altho‟ start by trying to eliminate “only”.

M.Avn. But this is our third largest arms market and growing. Also they pay.

F.Sec. Only altve. is to abstain (with France) : but effect on rest of C‟wealth?

U.S. licensing system said to be v. strict.

P.M. No : they evade it covertly. Investigate this.

M.H. “Only” is v. far reaching. It might exclude everything (except submarine) in event of wholesale internal rebellion.

L.Ch. And a bad precedent for eg. S. Rhodesia; tho‟ feeling on that point

different.

P.M. Try to exclude “only” : accept it, if necessary.

F.S. But if this amdt. fails and extreme resn. stands, we may not be able to defeat it. U.S. might abstain or even accept. If so, we shall be alone (except for France) : do we abstain or veto?

Our oblign. to S.A. is not part of Simonstown Agt. : but it is a moral oblign., contracted at same time.

Parly.Sec. Our stake in rest of Africa (C‟wealth) greater than in S. Africa. And

C.R.O. they aren‟t all bad payers.

P.M. Proceed as above : but if original resn. reinstated, abstain. Resn. is mandatory : but we shd. have to consider our posn. thereafter.

F.S. If so, how do we justify not vetoing? Can‟t rely on France to veto.

First Secy. Don‟t veto : but abstain and interpret according to taste? But if extreme, veto.

L.Ch. Too equivocal a posn.

P.M. Risk of retalin. v. serious : see Annex to C.(63)146.

Best to put up reasonable resn.; if voted down, abstain and interpret more extreme resn., even if mandatory according to taste. Justify this by refce to our special treaty relationship with S.A. wh. shdn‟t prevent others from doing as they see fit.

F.S. Will this stand up in Parlt.? We have no obligation to S.A. – only an undertaking to do our best to supply arms.

M.Avn. ?Threaten to veto extreme resn. unless S.C. will support our moderate resn.?

Home Sec. Must veto extreme resn. : otherwise our posn. indefensible.

Ch.Duchy. No : too dangerous in relation to rest of C‟wealth Africa.

P.M. Best to abstain and to make clear that we shall maintain our present policy and continue to discharge our “obligns.” to S.A.

L.P. But what about our oblign. to maintain U.N. Charter? A precedent for others!

M.H. This shd. override any new supply of arms.

M.Avn. This is relevant to H. Siddeley‟s modifcn. of B. contract provided that further order is placed.

L.Ch. Better to veto a mandatory resn. than abstain and purport to interpret it.

M.H. And even to abstain and maintain supplies wd. be as offensive to African C‟wealth as to veto.

P.M. Is there a future for this trade?

M.Avn. Yes : perhaps more Buccaneers, two submarines, and a lot of electronic equipment.

L.Ch. Argue issue is inappropriate to Secy. Council - it is not a threat to peace – and shd. be remitted to Gen. Assy.

L.P.S. But we have never dared to test this before Intl. Court. And precedents of earlier S.C. resns. on this subject are against us.

M.H.L.G. ?Accept resn. : arms trade with S.A. can‟t continue for long.

P.M. Must consider balance of advantage for U.K. Wd. U.S. cooperate in vetoing or organising enough abstentions?

Ch.Duchy. But we have ignored earlier resns. of S.C. Why not here?

L.Ch. Watch impact on Cameroons case before Intl. Court. And which S.C. resns. have we in fact ignored.?

M.A.F.F. ?Exclude only aircraft &amp; warships (where big money lies) : and, if necy. veto extreme resn. on this basis.

M.Def. Better to accept it, subject to existing contracts (wh. S.A. wd. not cancel : nor wd. they cancel S‟town Agt.) Sacrifice further contracts.

F.S. Party wd. not accept this. I will try first stage on M.A.F.F. basis i.e. self defence for S.A. rather than existing contracts for us.

?Put forward our own resn., on this basis : if rejected, abstain. Even tho‟ adopted resn. wd. be mandatory, our moral posn. wd. be better.

H.S. If First Secy. will accept veto on extreme resn., despite implicns. for S.Rd. we shd. surely veto – the only honourable course.

L.Ch. Try our own resn. first : then veto, if necy.

F.S. Remember value of S‟town Agt. if we have to go to aid of India.

P.M. Mod. resn most necy. or our own resn. first. If we fail, explain that while not vetoing but only abstaining, we propose to maintain existing policy : if this interpretn. not accepted, we may have to veto.

M.w.P. If we maintain existing policy, Oppn. will watch us v. closely.

F.S. I will try first stage first : and report. [Exit M.Avn.

7. Butter Imports. (oral)

P.B.T. Addl. imports of 40000 tons required. N.Z. originally cd. not contribute. Australia offered 10000 tons : Eire 5000 : foreign suppliers another 10000 tons. N.Z. then offered 8000 and by stipulating total import shd. not exceed 25000 tons, said theirs must be at expense of the foreign 10000 tons.

No commitment on this to N.Z. Therefore let foreign 10000 tons stand, and N.Z. will still have room for her 8000 tons, giving 33000 tons in all.

Parly Sec. Very well : but we must reaffirm May agreement.

C.R.O.

M.A.F.F. Quota system was based on 30% cut for N.Z. butter. Price well above this. N.Z. is behaving v. badly, since shortfall in quotas cd. not have been foreseen.

L.P.S. And don‟t reaffirm May agreement.

P.B.T. Intention was that N.Z. shd. have 40% of what we import : not that we shd. import from elsewhere 60% to match what they can send.

P.M. Agree as P.B.T.

8. Bailey Imports (oral)

M.A.F.F. Fr. competn. unfair. Hope to agree to £20 a ton : if they won‟t, must create anti-dumping arrangements and impose a levy to increase to £20.

P.B.T. Anti-dumping may be impracticable : but can arrange otherwise.

P.M. Approve : tactics shd. be agreed between P.B.T. &amp;M.A.F.F.

9. Import Policy for Jute. C(63)143 &amp; 144

P.B.T Changes in system of protection necessitated by ruling of R.P. Court.

Despite public resistance, industry will accept proposals in Annex,

particularly since it is doing pretty well.

I differ from S of S Scot. on “equated” foods : but will accept an enquiry, if necy.

S.of S.S. Industry expects continuing protection : must decide pattern of industry for 1970‟s and ease transition until altve. employment available.

“Equated” foods are vital to Dundee. 50% mark up might be insufficient. Therefore leave as it is for next year, during which

arrange an enquiry as a first step towards new policy for 70‟s. Essential is variable mark up for one more year, in return for which industry will accept 45% thereafter if enquiry has produced nothing better. Decline in other sectors of industry wd. be accepted.

P.M. This wd. have been a problem if we had gone into Common Market.

But we didn‟t. Why has B/T. circulated proposals so widely and created such alarm? We have now to retreat – but to what position? A fixed rate of mark up puts us at mercy of Indian and Pakistan prices. Therefore adopt S of S S.‟s proposal.

S.of S.S. It was the 20% suggested in C.M. context wh. worried them. They now see no reason why they shd. suffer, since we have not gone into C.M.

Ch.Exch. That is going too far : some modificn. of protection must be made.

P.M. We shd. achieve this by S of S S‟s proposal.

S.of S.S. Keep “excluded” goods at present level of 1000 tons : but give no guarantee for future – apart from letting J &amp; P have a share of 1000 tons.

P.B.T. I can‟t legally maintain a variable mark up for another year. The existing agreements for information have been condemned

L.Q. Ignore the agreements : just ask for necy. informn. – as necessary for transitional period before rate reduced to 45%.

P.M. P.B.T. must try to do this : and then adopt S of S S‟s proposal for a year. Discuss form of enquiry with S of S S.

[Exit Parly Sec. C.R.O.

10. Welfare Services : School Meals. C(63)126

M.Edn. C.(63)140 shows sharp rise in educn. expre. Saving on school meals therefore justified, given better arrangements for remission. Only £6-7 m. p.a. involved, offset by about £100,000 p.a. on remission plans.

H.S. Do it – at beginning of school year, before winter begins.

S.of S.S. But I have no counter offer : wrong to take this step now in Scotland even tho‟ unemployed wd. not be affected.

Ch.Sec. A great weakness not to do this, given rising cost of educn. expre.

First Sec. I agree. But we must tell Parlt.

L.P.S. Politically wrong. Distinguish between this sort of thing and not

introducing new expre.

P.M. Scotland and rural England a problem. Bad if children cease to take school meals, as has tended to happen in Scotland.

Ch.Duchy. I support L.P.S.

P.B.T. No : it won‟t have a lasting effect. Remember postal charges increase : and wool textiles and Japanese treaty.

P.M. People will pay more taxn. to get what they want. But how to tax is another matter. People mind paying more than not receiving.

“Exemption” of Glasgow is rather discreditable.

M.H.L.G. Remember prospective shift from rates to taxes.

M.Edn. I am assuming increase in educl. building starts. This is right context to announce increase in charge for meals.

M.H. There is political advantage in being tough with public expre.

M.L. No : it will be publicised as Tory meanness.

H.S. I disagree : but too late, Parliament wise, to do it now.

L.P. If so, impossible this side of the Election.

P.M. I will consider further.
