Ch.Secy. Implication for Robbins publicn. on 23rd. Now substitute written statement of Govt. policy on day after lobby confce. Alternatively, release it at lobby confce.

4. Kenya. (oral)

Col.Sec. Reported agreement with KANU on revision of 1962 constn.

Opposed by KADU : but any other course wd. have been rejected by KANU who are the Govt. They wd have then rejected existing constn: and chaos wd. have resulted. That wd have meant rule by Br. troops – merely to defer indepce. for a short time.

No KADU reaction since confce. ended : KADU divided on wisdom of using force.

P.M. Gratitude for Col. Secy‟s efforts. to reach agreement without dishonourable repercussions for U.K. Govt.

F.S. Europeans doubt KADU‟s will to stage large scale trouble. They support Col.Sec.‟s settlement.

and assumed the title of Sir Alexander Douglas-Home. K.T.
