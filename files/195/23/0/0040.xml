C.M.(64)12 18 February 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. P.M.‟s Visit to Ottawa and Washington. (oral)

[Enter Ch.Whip.

P.M. Importance of direct contact with Pres. Good personal relations. L.B.J. will leave foreign affairs to Rusk, at least until after election; this will mean rather slower, more cautious approach. But L.B.J. v. anxious to keep special relationship.

Malaysia : v. successful. They now understand logic of our view.

L.B.J. distrusts Sukarno? : and will support us, if „S‟ rats.

Renewed understanding about nuclear consultns.

Holy Loch : addnl. words included.

Nuclear “freeze” : whatever it is, it won‟t affect our Polaris &amp; T.S.R. 2.

Rest of policy of movement to be maintained – tho‟ no great initiative.

V. impressed by our action in E. Africa.

Trade with Cuba : they understood our posn. – but our firms must also realise that they may suffer in trade with U.S.A. if they continue to trade with Cuba.

F.S. Great personal success for P.M.

Freeze also not to affect M.L.F. I shall support concept in principle in Geneva.

K. Round discussns. with Rusk and Herter : almost identity of view on tariffs and agriculture. Powell will continue in detail.

U.S. want us to support them in South V.N. and to oppose Fr. concept of neutrality. We conceded this – not physically – in return for their backing of Malaysia.

P.M. Ghana : they are thinking of cutting off aid to Volta. We warned them to be careful.

Zanzibar : they have abandoned intervention and favour recognition!

M.Def shd. examine implicn. of freeze.

S/S.ITRD. R.R.P. confirms U.S. will be firm on tariffs, on basis that EEC posn. is almost non-negotiable. Hope Germans will then come down off their perch.

F.S. U.S. opposed to asymmetrical reductions – which alone wd. appeal to Russians!

2. Cyprus. (oral)

Com.Sec. Must now wait for Secy. C. debate. Br. troops increasingly unpopular: must therefore not play too prominent part in intl. force. Partition may be inevitable.

Revival of armed EOKA.

3. South East Study. C.P.(64)37, 44 &amp; 45

S/S.ITRD. Only para 20 not yet agreed.

Nature of problem.

Do we publish? Yes – existence well known : and wh. need basis for consultn. with L.A.‟s By end March, to reassure London.

On new towns, names mentioned in Study but not endorsed in W.P. O.k.?

Impact on N.E. &amp; Scot : consistency? Will new town divert industry from N.E. &amp; Scot? No: time phasing shd. prevent.

But machinery of expanded towns (para 20) still in dispute.

M.H.L.G. London housing still v. bad : M- Holland Enquiry will confirm this.

Hence policy of deliberate overspill. First, release of more land round towns, for 2¼ m. people by normal machinery, for private devt.

Second, few brown spots in Green Belt to be developed for commuters.

Third – planned o‟spill, but not – as normally – by new towns but to some extent by expansion of existing towns for 1¼ m. people.

I can accept para 20, provided that :-

a) expansion in cat 3. can be based on public acqn., wh. removes land from specn.; enables us to phase timing of devt. to fit in with priorities for N.E. etc. : enables us to recover betterment (roads etc.) when sold for private devt.

b) where necessary – in 12 cases – we use new town arrangements for mere expansion : with legn., if necy.

c) I am free to talk in terms of taking profit out of land specn. Otherwise, credit for scheme will be obscured by public argument on this.

M.P.B.W. I favour para 20 as is. Say nothing about legn. : present release of land etc. as logical devt. of what we have done already, including release of more lands for private devt.

Ch.Exch. New towns machinery not broadly satisfy. at present – para 20.

And final para of para 20. premature: don‟t lock up money too soon.

C.S. No: profitable to Govt.

Ch.Sec. On contrary : merely locks up capital and accepts Labour view that only get land at reasonable prices by public acqn.

M.A.F.F. Involves premature acqn. of ¼ m. acres of agr. land in S.E. and deprives owners of betterment. They shd. retain existing devt. values; tenants shd. stay in occupn. until devt. starts: surplus land shd. first be offered to former owners – particularly acute if land compulsorily acquired is made over to private developer.

Agre : shd. be better represented on N.T. Corporations.

M.H.L.G. Farmers &amp; landowners will get market value, excluding value to be

created by devt. This is current N.T. practice : and landowners accept.

M.W.P.(D) Avoid any new initiatives on “compensn. &amp; bettt.”. Otherwise shall

be represented as having abolished devt. charge and being faced with same old problem. M.H.L.G.‟s idea of talking ((c) above) is better.

Ch.Secy Even so, amend last sentence to read “ … where necessary, well in advance”.

L.Ch. Para 20 conceals large issues – particularly M.A.F.F.‟s third point.

And Crichel Down policy difficult enough already without enlarging its area of applicn.

Not easy to continue by refuse C.D.C.‟s in areas proposed for devt. And in many cases no altve. to taking good agricl. land. (Para 22.)

M.A.F.F. But we must say this. Often there is altve. Must retain para 22.

M.L.G. Must retain concept of acquiring well in advance of need. Otherwise, not plausible that we can deal with problem, at least from point of view of edn. Must at least add “where necessary”.

M.H.L.G. Can‟t avoid naming towns : otherwise no discussion with L.A.‟s.

But amount of land so large and areas of local altve. so many “covening” almost impossible.

No answer to specn. except natn.: and we can show Labour policy unworkable.

I wd. omit “well” (in advance): but I can‟t accept “where necy.” since that involves distinctions.

Cost about £40 m. : and it will bring a profit to Exch. over 6-8 yrs.

L.A.‟s won‟t mind: they dislike present Town Devt. Act and will welcome a new public agency, wh. will have to co-operate with them. I will certainly put agr. repve. on them; leave tenant farmers as long as possible: and minimise sterilisation of agr. land.

Politically good for us to show concern about rising land values, particly. since doing nothing about them in case off 2¼ m. people, where release of land (Lea Valley) is causing astronomical increases. Our proposal is a mouse by comparison.

Ch.Secy. May be a profit : but not as large as might be obtained otherwise. Agree omit “well” : but must have “where necy.” or “where appropriate”.

L.P. But must act in good time.

Ch.Exch. But indefensible to restrict specn. in some areas but leave it in others, where only release of more land is involved and prices will rise v. sharply.

M.H.L.G. But experience at Basingstoke does not confirm this. And no altve. except natn. or taxn. It is natural result of prospering free society : and it is only extension of what we already do.

[Enter Home Secy.

M.W.P.(D) Para 16 weak. Must specify two places.

W.P. will be linked with Buchanan and appear unconvincing.

L.P. But can‟t specify without consulting L.A.‟s.

M.H. Therefore merge para 16 with para 25.

P.M. Get N.E. &amp; Scot. point earlier: redraft 16 &amp; 25: ?redraft 20. But on main issue?

L.P. Must have some policy quickly – if only to allay discontent in central London.

Ch.Duchy. Must settle before Greater London elections.

P.M. But must settle comprehensively: otherwise Labour policy of complete natn. is unanswerable.

M.H.L.G. No : their scheme is unworkable. And the attack on land prices is coming anyhow : we must answer it.

M.P.B.W. Yes: mainly by releasing more land for private devt.

L.Ch. Yes: but not round towns scheduled in Study.

Ch.Exch. Can‟t do it only partially or appear to be keeping only some prices down, or to collect only some betterment.

M.H.L.G. It isn‟t to keep prices down: it is to phase timing of devt.

P.M. Redraft in light of discussns. Then small meeting to probe land values question.

M.A.F.F. Proposed treatment of tenant farmer will provoke demand for compensn., particularly if acqn. by public authy.
