C.C.(63)53 19 September 1963. 10.30 a.m.

1. Foreign Affairs. (oral) [Enter Ch.Whip : Sol.Gen.

a) Indonesia

P.S. Embassy burnt : little police protection. A planned riot? as alternative to attack on Sarawak etc.

Army now protecting Br. lives. Hope assurances will be given.

Avoid rupture of dip. relations, if possible. But claim full compensation for all properties destroyed.

P.M. Palmerston no good any more. No point in breaking off dip. relations – which are for our benefit (investments etc) rather than theirs. We have got good terms for our oil companies : don‟t jeopardise these.

All military precautions against infiltration now taken.

Ch.Exch. Continue to trade with rich country if possible.

L.P. Even if not civilised?

P.M. But Ch.Exch shd. reconsider extent of credit (E.C.G.D.) to Indonesia.

2. The Denning Report (oral – but roned‟d text read by Minister).

P.M. On contents, some excision necessary on security grounds : Quotations doubtful if could lead to demand for full publication. Refces to Ivanov‟s “defection”, also arguable. Will discuss with H. Wilson, who has read the report; and will consider further.

M.H. Politically, accept disadvantages in interest of virtually complete publication.

P.M. Any excision in respect of prejudice to pending Keeler trial for perjury?

Sol.Gen. Circs. v. unusual : K. has already [said] so much about herself, and so much has been said in e.g. Ward trial, that nothing in D. Report cd. really prejudice her trial. Amdt. of report to safeguard this wd. make report unintelligible (and might be even more prejudicial); deferment of publicn. means postponement till end of Oct – perhaps much later.

L.Ch. ?Show her lawyers the possibly prejudicial passages. But I wd. take the risk of publication. Report only affects her character – wh. she has already exposed – not the grounds of actual charge.

P.M. What about her credibility? Law Off. shd. check no risk on this score.

L.Ch. And check Ch.9. qua conspiracy to pervert course of justice.

P.M. Allow a week for printing. When thereafter? Denning has asked for protection of Parly. privilege – for others. Do we agree?

Sol.Gen. P.P. Act 1840 protects S. Office. Quotations thereafter wd. normally be protected by qualified privilege – the stronger for being derived from absolute priv.

If no P.P. Act protection only qual. priv. wd, apply throughout.

L.Ch. I agree. Even Denning wd. not be completely protected. Any issue of writs wd. detract from value of report.

First Secy. I agree : Parly. protection essential.

Ch.Duchy. I agree – reluctantly.

P.M. This means By Order of our or other H. of P. In case of Commons, this implies merely putting on Order Paper : nodding and no debate by custom.

In case of Lords, a debate might be more probable (in light of Lord Salisbury‟s letter in to-day‟s Times). Do we risk this rather than recall Commons merely for this? Or do we recall Commons? Or do we wait till reassembly? We shall be ready to publish by 2 Oct. Does loss, or gain, of 3 weeks matter?

Ch.Sec. ?Publish as Cd. Paper : and introduce Act of Indemnity, if necy.

L.P. Retrospective legn. to abolish somebody‟s rights, objectionable.

L.Ch. Advantage of P.P. Act 1840 is that it absolutely excepts &amp; sets aside any writ that may be issued. Fears of adequacy of pre-election of qualified privilege would be less. Any writ would tend to stifle public discussion.

L.P. Watch Rees Davies on this : report implies he was guilty of professional misconduct.

L.P.S. If Denning were then called as witness and pleaded confidential nature of evidence he had taken …. ? cf journalists in Vassall case.

P.M. If so, must either wait for reassembly or summon either or both of Houses to meet between 2 and 24 Oct. Party Conferences make either date difficult. And House, having assembled, can‟t easily be persuaded to go away without debate. Necessary to be sure of a majority for two days.

First Secy. Impracticable. Either a Lords session or leave till re-assembly or advance re-assembly.

Ch.Duchy. Can‟t wait till re-assembly. Lords device weak – therefore publish and

be damned.

Home Sec. I agree.

P.M. Absolute privilege is valuable only to Denning and me and S.O.: Denning believes he is protected by qual. priv. But if we waive it and Press think this is designed to inhibit publication and comment, that wd. be serious.

If nothing real in this, however, may be better to publish as Cmd. Paper which itself has qual. priv.

Ch.D. Particularly since recall of H/C. wd. require some issue of national importance – which this is not!

First Secy. But must regard Denning‟s own wishes – if we ignore them, no judge may be willing to act in this capacity in future.

And writs may be moved : and then whole affair may drag on indefinitely.

P.M. Risk is limited to Rees Davies, Mann and Keeler.

Sol.Gen. No writ wd. be likely to come to trial; but it might be issued merely for trouble making.

L.Ch. And writ against Denning himself, with protection of only qual. priv. wd. be very embarrassing.

P.M. We cd. gain a week by meeting on 17 Oct. and avoiding debate by proroguing forthwith.

L.P.S. Alternatively have Lords session, provided H. Wilson, Leader of Liberal Lords and Lord Salisbury agree.

L.P. They won‟t agree – for different reasons.

L.P.S. That rules out Lords plan.

H.Sec. I agree : therefore publish and be damned.

L.Ch. If so, and if writs are issued, we shd. then legislate for indemnity.

P.M. Why? It wd. only protect Denning, S.O. and me!

M.H. Even if Parlt. were sitting, wd. this be published automatically – or does procedure apply only to proceedings arising from statute or Parly. resoln.?

Ch.Whip. That is point of “unopposed return” procedure. Any Member can invoke this procedure on a matter of importance.

P.M. But is it generally “customary”. Wd. Speaker allow it to be opposed?

Ch.Wh. Not, if he follows Eustace May.

P.M. But Commons impracticable anyhow, given Party Conferences.

Therefore I will sound H. Wilson on Lords device. But timing will be tight : and agreement by all Parties wd. be essential. If, for these reasons, Lords device is out, Commons recall is impracticable and advancing prorogation is not worth it, choice lies between waiting for re-assembly and publishing as Cd. Paper. If latter, must make it clear that it gives Press no less real protection than Parly. publicn.. If so, must justify this to Denning, since he cd. be sued. We must therefore be ready to indemnify him by legn., if necessary.

L.P. I am sure Lords device won‟t work. But if H.W. volunteers it, we must consider it.

Risky to give him the chance! Therefore publish – and take the risk of a writ.

P.M. Reconsider after I have seen H.W.
