C.M.(64)5 17 January 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Prime Minister : McLeod‟s article in “Spectator”. (oral)

F.S. All shd. refrain from comment on McLeod‟s article. Pledge of loyalty to P.M.

P.M. Thanks. Concentrate on winning election.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Cyprus

F.S. Secy. Gen. has now sent repve. to London confce. Will see him &amp; let him see communal leaders. Work for gradual increase in U.N. participn., without involving them in decision.

b) W.E.U.

F.S. Fr. anxious not to let this meeting interfere with Six. Ok. by us.

P.M. Erhard. Relations good: many subjects covered (costs agt. will be honoured by April : may be followed by another).

I said we were interested in W.E. political unity : but can‟t afford another rebuff. Therefore play slow until election. E. agrees – sees risks of danger if economic integration raises political issues for wh. no machinery available. But defer initiative for time being.

On long term credits we differed. We stick to normal commercial principles : E. says it is economic pressure wh. influences S.U.

On E-W relations, E. firm on remaining in Atlantic community : search for agt. with S.U. tends to take second place.

F.S. Schroeder admitted domestic pressure mainly responsible for latest German initiative for agt. with S.U. But sceptical about results. U.S. probably as keen on this as G.

P.M. E. will tell de G. that he does not accept his concept of Europe and his opposition to N.A.T.O. Regards MLF as important in this context –

i.e. if he quarrels with de G, M.L.F. must go forward. I told him we shd. be defeated in Parlt.; but let discussions go on until after election. E. accepts; but G. clearly more keen on idea than E.U.

M.D. Am examining altves. – particly chance of basing it on existing weapons rather than new ones.

P.M. E. thinks of it as maritime. But examn. of a variant wd. fill up time.

Cultural exchanges : confce. in April – must support.

3. Transport.

a) Rural transport. (oral)

L.Ch. Lords Qn. about rural transport.

M.T. C.C. Assocn. are trying to get something going “on the ground” in six areas.

Will try to see bus operators before P.Q. to be answered. Can then brief Lords spokesmen.

L.Ch. Yes: must strike a positive note.

P.M. Similar statement shd be made in Commons.

M.W.P(D). What about relaxing control on plying for hire?

M.T. Must deal with this in statement.

P.M. Let us consider (? Tuesday) draft a comprehensive statement, covering as many aspects as possible.

b) Railway Closures. C.P.(64)16

Ch.Duchy. As in memm.

P.M. On what is deferment to be based? Conurbations etc. are sound ground.

L.P.S. But this wd. let almost anybody claim deferment. Hence proposal for admve. delay – i.e. not putting more on TUCC‟s than they can cope with. We have done this privately with Beeching qua Scotland : now again as in para 9.

P.M. But they may be able to deal with some of the ones wh. we want delayed. Must have a more respectable reason.

M.P.B.W. Must also make it clear that no closure until altve. facilities.

M.T. We have said this already.

L.Ch. And can‟t rely on inability of TUCC‟s to work faster : we shd. increase TUCC‟s – as Cab. originally decided!

P.M. Devt. implications better ground.

Ch.Secy. But that means that we must do the scrutiny: and how do we choose in which cases we set aside normal TUCC machinery?

P.M. V. well. Risky to rely on “old boy” approach to Beeching. May not work in cases where TUCC can operate quickly : and may leak. But if Cab. ready to take this risk – so be it. But reason must be respectable – and I still prefer the devt. argument, even if in combination with overload on TUCC argument.

H.S. I agree with P.M. We are building a Victoria tube wh. will run at a loss for urban transport reasons. That is right principle.

M.T. But how do you select more of these than (many) wh. Beeching has already excluded.

M.H.L.G. I wd. still want to add more than in para 9.

P.M. Accept proposed compromise, inclined a little towards M.H.L.G.

Don‟t hurry – now – with enlargement of TUCC‟s.

M.W.P.(A) Better publicity for procedure essential.

L.P.S. Say also no holiday resort lines will be closed until after holidays this year.

Ch.Duchy. Particly. since TUCC‟s unlikely to deal with them anyhow.

Ch.Secy. But can‟t exempt a whole category : and some holiday lines already before TUCC‟s.

S/S.ITRD. Even so, say now that no decision will be given until after holidays.

Ch.Exch. If this is a good point, let Beeching say it (on economic grounds) rather than us.

P.M. And it can‟t be limited to seaside resorts.

Result of approaches to Beeching to be reported to Cttee. &amp; by them to Cab.

4. Relations with EEC &amp; EFTA C.P.(64)15 [Exit M.T.

F.S. Risk of “ditch” between EEC and EFTA increasing. Therefore must try – with German support and in face of Fr. opposition – to make success of K. Round.

S.S.ITRD. I agree. Shall try to bring EFTA into line on K.R. in near future.

P.M. Read MAFF‟s minute. Must seize chance to press objectives of our own. ag. policy.

S/S.ITRD. Agree : but not certain whether U.S. &amp; other suppliers will accept this as sufficient commitment.

M.H.L.G. Any other means of maintaining links with Six? Travel, youth exchanges etc.

F.S. Will keep in touch with MHLG on these. Must also keep close to European ideas on political union.

P.M. Let ideas on cultural contacts be put to F.S. for Cab. discussion – in relation to O‟Neill‟s despatch.

5. Commonwealth Policy. C.P.(64)6 and 9.

[Enter M/S. C.R.O . : Secy. D.T.C. : L.P.

P.M. See C‟w. passage in Queen‟s Speech. Must make this effective. Hence my proposals. Objns. to CEDC formidable; but any harm in reviving it? Or in using existing machinery to prepare for K. Round and U.N. Confce. on T. &amp; D.

Also follow up para 3 – VSOS and Educn. Confce. in August.

L.P.S. We are simply drifting : supporting disheartened : election theme required.

Must get something moving – e.g. Export Council : U.K. mfctrs. thought to be losing interest. And support para 3.

L.Ch. C‟w expansion of Judicial Cttee. has failed. But should be a C‟w. court, as distinct from the Hague.

H.S. ?Revive Templer‟s Youth Trust.

Ch.Exch. That wd. be better than economic field, where pressure wd. be counter-productive. C‟w. economies are disparate (not single, as in case of NEDC) Hence my careful proposal at last C‟w. Finance Minl confce. Even that was coolly received and may not endure.

S/S.ITRD. Any economic initiative must be in conformity with, and contribute to, modern C‟wealth. Modern C‟wealth is increasingly against formalisation of C‟wealth relationship and looks to world orgns.

In last 7 years our C‟wealth imports have declined, mainly in foodstuffs (as result of our agricl. policy). And, altho‟ C‟w. imports have increased, our share is minimal. We must increase it, but tailored to meet individual members‟ needs. We are doing this, by reorganising N. American Exports Councils, by promoting fair in Australia etc. Canada is worst case, in terms of disparity of our exports/imports ratio.

Will discuss with Sharp (Can. Min of Trade).

Invite C‟w. delegates to U.N. Confce. to London for prelimy. discussions. Consider doing same when GATT confce. settled.

F.S. Welcome this, altho‟ it may be embarrassing!

P.M. Cd. we repeat – e.g. for Africa – the FCCC‟s Action Council?

S/S.ITRD. Possibly. Only two firms wd. take part in fair in Libya. But it depends on quality of businessmen who run Action Councils.

M.P.B.W. Shd. try to establish a “C‟wealth Movement”, like the “European

Movement”.

P.M. We must make it clear that, as far as we are concerned, door is open on economic co-opn. : and stress Action Cttees. etc.

M/S.C.R.O. Bank &amp; income guarantees scheme might be worth examn. But beware of encouraging expropriation.

Ch.Exch. And it always means more money from U.K.

M/S.C.R.O. Para 3. Scope for more hostels for C‟w. students. Only 653 new places so far provided on 1961 programmes of 5000 - result of tight Tsy. control.

M.H.L.G. And it competes with housing.

Secy.D.T.C. VSOS v. important: am assuming expansion.

Increase in supply of exports also v. important (d) in para 3 also; and (a). Note 5(c) – v. important.

L.Ch. 1965 Law Confce. in Australia. Must send reasonable sized delegn.; and must help (financially) those who are not members of public service.

Ch.S. Beware of precedent for other interests.

P.M. Let L.P.S., Ch.Sec., S/S.ITRD., M. Edn., &amp; Secy. T.C. sort all this out. Any other Ministers with ideas shd. send them in. Home Sec. &amp; M/S. C.R.O. shd. be members.

M.Edn. Remember C‟w. Institute.

6. Tariffs. C.P.(64)14

P.M. Only for information.

7. School Leaving Age. C.P.(64)1 and 10

L.P. Majority of Cttee favoured increase as educationally &amp; politically desirable. (Counterbalance to Robbins). But difficult for Scotland (who are not ready); and v. expensive. I side, rather lukewarmly, with majority view.

M.Edn. a) Politically, we must make a statement : committed by Eccles. Bad if it avoids a date, particularly after prompt endorsement of Robbins.

b) Educationally, only 45% of popn. will stay on voluntarily for fifth year by 1970 : and v. unevenly distributed between north and south. The C.S.E. must involve a 5 year course : how can we defend only half of school age people staying on to do it. And revision of curriculum etc. depends on initiative wh. raising age wd. provide. This without

prejudice to nature of last year‟s course.

c) Financially, if starts in 1970, no need to add to existing programmes, except another £40 m. over 1968-71. And might be offset if entry age (for compulsory educn, were raised – wh. opinion is increasingly supporting.

We are trying to get max. teacher numbers anyhow : so any extra cost here doesn‟t really count.

S/S. S. Decision must be U.K. Can‟t have difference in Scotland. But :-

a) Politically, Sc. atmosphere different : more importance given to bldgs. &amp; teachers. Cttee. in Scotland, parallel to Newson, came to opposite conclusion : increase in age wd therefore be opposed by teachers, who wd press for increase in teacher numbers first.

And problem greater because fewer chn remain voluntarily after 15 in Scotland.

If an extra year, shd. not be in school but shd. be largely craft training on day release basis.

And date shd. therefore be tied firmly to supply of teachers and to nature of course. Might then be accepted in Scotland.

Ch.Sec. See para 2 of my memm. Other issues must be considered simultaneously.

Bldg. cost is £115 m : M. Edn. redn. to £45 m. depends on assumpn. that balance is met from existing programmes – wh. have been inflated above normal level to deal with bulge and cd. not be sustained at that pace. Doubtful educationally also.

Ch.Exch. Agree. We have published forward figures up to 67-68. That represents max, or rather more. Must not accept piecemeal additions for subsequent period.

L.P. Announce – and postpone.

Ch.S. No : irresponsible.

H.S. Last year at school (whatever age) is peak age of juvenile delinquency.

Therefore last year must not be frustration. Provided positive curriculum can be devised, I wd. favour increase. But not otherwise.

M.Edn. It is bottom (i.e. below GCE) half who are affected here : and no incentive to devise curriculum for these until age is raised.

M.Lab. Emphasis on technological training wd. cohere with our policy – e.g. Industrial Training Bill. Therefore favour it.

Ch.Sec. We already keep chn longer at school (10 yrs.) than any other country; 11 yrs. will make it worse. ?Raise entry age.

L.P. But 15-16 year more valuable than 5-6 year.

Ch.Sec. To eliminate 5-6 years wd. at least offset cost.

P.M. Consider further – with other projects : and expln. of choice of year.
