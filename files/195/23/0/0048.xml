C.M.(64)20 24 March 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

2. University Salaries. (oral)

Ch.S. NIC report published tomorrow. Proposes increases of 8%-23% averaging 17%.

Cost £6 m. p.a. Shd. accept promptly : what NIC was meant to do.

Announce acceptance midday Thursday. Award a lot less than AUT want. Therefore accept quickly.

L.P. Agree in principle. But I haven‟t seen report (only a summary). And I ought to consult U.G.C.

M.Edn. Watch CAT‟s : will consult Ch. Sec. And publicn. will increase pressure on teachers‟ salaries at N.U.T Easter confce. Unfortunate timing.

M.W.P.(D) And row on doctors‟ pay will break (quite unjustifiably) on Wed.

M.Lab. Must publish : but don‟t hurry to accept? Leave till after Easter.

Otherwise too hasty : and conveys impression Govt. had fore-knowledge.

L.Ch. Yes : better to defer publicn. till Thursday : and decision after Easter reasonable.

Ch.Exch. Fatal to delay approval of what is virtually an arbitrn. award.

P.M. Announce acceptance in principle on Thursday : full statement on Tuesday Ap. 7.

3. Committee of Privileges. (oral)

Discussion on question whether to allow Hogg/Wigg controversy to go to Cttee. (if Speaker so rules) or to vote down motion for refce.

Agreed to accept refce. to Cttee. – unless Wigg, in moving refce., is so offensive that Govt. supporters insist on voting down motion.

4. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Libya

F.S. L.Govt. want negotns. on 20 April, on basis of termination of Treaty and evacn. of bases. Origin is Eg. pressure and weakness of L. Govt. Play slow; try to save staging and o‟flying rights. U.S. v. concerned about Wheelers Field. Will concert action with them.

C.S. Don‟t acquiesce in unill. denuncn of treaty – at least until satisfy. new one.

Might be better to withdraw but preserve legal rights wh. wd. entitle us to continue o‟flying and perhaps use of El Aden.

M.W.P.(D) Libya and Cyprus point to fresh review of Malta. Avoid Cy. indepce.

C.S. Malta refm. will be a mess : we needn‟t worry.

P.M. Watch reaction on Yemen also. U.S. may realise their policy to Nasser has failed.

M.D. Loss of El Aden (and of Cyprus?) wd. be v. serious indeed. Therefore play slow.

C.S. Redn. or agt. to “review” Treaty : don‟t attend confce. to “terminate” it.

b) Cyprus

F.S. Both T. and G. have accepted Finn as mediator.

c) Cambodia

F.S. Sihanouk v. difficult. U.S. S.V.-N.and Th won‟t accept Geneva confce. U.S. now support 4 Power conversations : C. will accept if France associated.

I have proposed to S. Union 4 Power talks – U.S. : C : S.V.-N : Th – best. France might be acceptable to U.S.

d) Kennedy Round

M.A.F.F. H.M. Amb. Paris reports Fr. as likely to sabotage K.R. Is this true?

F.S. Fr. Govt. have probably not decided. I will include memm on prospects after Easter.

S/S.I. C‟w. Ministers‟ confce., preparatory to U.N. confce. v. satisfactory. No pressure on us for more aid, tho‟ Ghana may press for new orgn. instead of G.A.T.T.

5. Export Credits. C.P.(64)76

S/S.I. Have agreed with F.S. on £1.6 m. E.C.G.D. Advy. C. favour £4 m. (+½ m. margin) on commercial basis : any less wd. have to be announced as Govt. decision, wh. wd. be a bad precedent as regards credit for S.U. etc. £4 m. wd. not have to be publicised.

F.S. S.1 is right. But £4 m. too high : equivalent to contract value of £30 m, wh. U.S. wd. resist. £2-2½ m. wd. be better.

S/S.I. Impossible if genuinely on a commercial basis. Loco orders now withdrawn; so have H. Siddeley fearing retaliation. But shipbuilders bidding actively.

M.T. But shipping lines won‟t handle cargoes to Cuba.

M.D. What credit are U.S. extending to Nasser and Indonesia? ?Scope for a swap. If they won‟t play, we are entitled to go ahead.

S/S.I. Cuba behaving quite responsibly as regards finance of repayments etc. And they are ready to negotiate compensn. for Shell. Therefore go ahead with this as well.

U.S. policy towards Cuba wholly unconstructive: we shdn‟t play their game.

L.P. But does E.C.G.D. assessment of commercial risk take account of political factors?

S/S.I. Yes : and we can‟t reject Advy. C.‟s view on this.

Ch.Exch. But if insure less than ceiling, no reflection on Advy. C.

M.D. Yes, it is. We can‟t have it both ways. Better to move straight to S.2.

P.M. Scope for bargain with U.S. v. small. They have cut aid to Indonesia sharply : and can‟t bargain aid for trade. Let £4 m. stand, but keep under review and tell Advy. C. to consult us again when approaches £3m. or earlier if politically difficult. F.S. reserves his posn.

6. Capital Finance for Universities. C.P.(64)78 &amp; 81

L.P. As in memm. We have accepted Robbins‟ student target for 1967 and U.G.C. “buffer” principle. Former was 197.000 Univy. places. Of these 5.000 o‟sea students can be compressed out : 22.000 can be offset against places in institl. not now of Univy. standard. Therefore 170.000 is our pledged target. 124.000 at present. Therefore 46.000 places needed.

Altvly Tsy. target was 170.000 by 1973 – implying say 153.000 by 1967, i.e. deficit of 17.000. But former presl. preferable.

Of 4 years involved, 66 and 67 can be ignored, because buildings started in those years can‟t affect our ability to hit target by 1967.

Earlier programme provided £33½ m in ‟64 and again in ‟65. U.G.C. calculated that, to enable us to hit our R. target, something extra needed (whereas Tsy. said only a douceur). Univs. bids in total provided for twice R. student numbers : U.G.C. required them to be reduced by 50%. Even so, Tsy. offer of £10 m. extra for ‟64 wd. be inadequate. But I have pressed U.G.C. to compress still further : and £25 m extra for 1965 absolutely essential to enable us to hit target. (Extra £15 m. for ‟64 agreed).

That means extra £40 m. on top of original £67 m. over the two years.

R. estd. a univ place to cost about £3000 : and said that ⅔ shd. be residential. Earlier programmes cost £2300 per place. U.G.C.‟s

programme costs about £2700 per place : and provides only about ½ residential. Therefore no room for manoeuvre at all unless we go back on our acceptance of R. target (wh. Ch. Secy. agrees in rejecting) or endorse target but cut U.G.C. scale of provision to meet it or defer a decision (wh. implies Univs. won‟t move and we shall fail to hit target). Must therefore accept £25 m. for ‟65 or face row with U.G.C.

Ch. Sec. The £33½ m. for ‟65 was announced last summer, on basis that provision for Robbins wd. be needed. I endorse the 170.000 student target : but I question scale of provision for this purpose. We must be Spartan while we are dealing with the first peak. Cost per place (?£3.700) much too high : and, if proposals provide practically 100% hostels, too generous. Tsy. shd. cross examine U.G.C. direct and get details U.G.C. used to provide. V. important given state of rest of investt. programme and pressure on other Ministers to reduce. Decision on univs. therefore premature.

Ch.Exch. Emphasise gravity of ec. posn. B/P deficit of £300 m. this year : £400 m. next year : Shortage of labour : rise in prices. Must therefore examine whole investt. programme.

M.Edn. U.G.C. have compressed univs. from 60 to 40 over the 2 years. Another row with U.G.C. wd. be disastrous.

The £15 m. for ‟64 was achieved after a cut in school bldg. programme wh. left some further margins for R.

And £3.700 per place a doubtful estimate.

P.M. Must adhere to our pledge. But how? I will examine with Ministers concerned.

Ch.Exch. Must include housing etc. in any review.

P.M. I agree : Tsy : Housing : Educn. : Health – tomorrow. H.S. to take charge of prelimy. meeting on how to meet pledge : I will take subsequent meeting on rest of investt. programmes.

7. Treatment of Offenders. C.P.(64)80 [Enter Att. Gen.

H.S. W.P. revised on lines Cab. wanted.

Cd. be published on Thursday : or in Budget week. Thursday not v. suitable : but unavoidable unless Kilbrandon can be delayed (so that E. and W. W.P. does not look like an afterthought). Also risk of being anticipated by Longford – tho‟ I wd accept this risk.

S/S.S. I cd. accommodate H.S. on Kilbrandon timing.

L.Ch. Paras 19-22 shd. be omitted : not relevant to “War against Crime”.

H.S. No. I will omit 2 : but must retain other 2. I will alter title.

P.M. H.S. L.Ch. and M. Edn. shd. reconsider : Cab to review after Easter.

M. Edn. I am content.

F.S. So am I.

L.Ch. I will settle privately with H.S. And try to announce chairman at same time.

P.M. Agree. No need to return to Cab.

8. Committee of 100. (oral)

Att.Gen. Cttee of 100 organising Easter Saturday demonstrations at U.S. base, Ruislip and at Rosyth. [Exit Att. Gen.

9. Removal of P.O.S.B. from London. C.P.(64)75 and 79

[Enter P.M.G.

P.M.G. Senior staff still silent. Junior staff maintain preference for Teeside.

Important to retain their goodwill, both here and in future cases.

Housing and commuting fell against Glasgow.

S.S.S. G. cd. be publicly defended as in my memm. Commuting risk unreal. Decision can‟t turn on staff preferences : otherwise nothing will ever be done for Scotland.

Ch.Sec. Staff preference v. important in case where no considn. of operational efficiency are involved. And a row here wd. be a v. bad advt. for Glasgow.

P.M. Depopn. of W. Scot. v. serious. And, if known that we have yielded to staff, we shall never get another dispersal to an unpopular place.

H.S. I agree.

L.Ch. G.‟s claims v. strong. If H.Q. can‟t be split. I favour G.

L.P. N.E. will be v. cross. They think it is in the bag.

M.H.L.G. Merits of N.E. are v. strong : and we ought not to damage dispersal policy.

Ch.Duchy. I now switch from G. to N.E.

M.A.F.F. If so, so do I.

M.Lab I stick to G. but with less confidence.

P.M. Any other dispersals as consolation prizes?

Decide in favour of G : try to announce others to Teeside at some time.

Announce before Easter.

10. Electricity Industry. (oral)

M.P. All demands met so far. But some plant (4000 k.w.) already out of commission. Position will progressively deteriorate.

M.Lab. Now that T.U.C. have intervened, I may be approached later today.
