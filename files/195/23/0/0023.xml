C.M.(63)9 5 December 1963. 10 a.m.

1. Pensions [Enter S/S. War : M.P.N.I. : Ch. Whip.

(a) Pre-Grigg widows. (oral)

M.D. Great pressure in informed circles. Repercussions in Services cd. be hard.

No real risk elsewhere – eg. In Civil Service.

Ch.S. Cost immaterial. But breach of principle – i.e. that date does not imply change in formula – wh. wd. have to be extended to other classes.

Current pressure for parity for officers shows that there wd. be reactions in Services.

1962 Act gave large increases in public service pensions. This shd. suffice.

M.D. But if concession of parity – i.e. automatic link with c/l – to civil service after 1918. Abandoned; but a precedent.

Ch.S. But that was universal – Forces as well as C.S. And unworkable!

L.Ch. Indefensible to protect some people – eg. rating relief – but to leave these widows without help.

Ch.Exch. But how can we change now - after all we have said – except for blatantly electoral reasons?

M.D. Nonsense. I have often changed my mind! [Exit M.Def.

L.P.S. Remove from election atmosphere by promoting review of pensions principles as a whole.

Ch.Exch. No risk of price rise before election. Don‟t encourage expectation of this or re-open whole issue of parity.

M.Edn. We may have to re-open it anyhow. But whether or not reactions in Services – eg. OR widows not now entitled – are certain.

Stay as we are.

Ch.S. Indefensible to select one small group simply because of pressure.

M.H.L.G. I agree.

M.H. No great pressure on parity. Don‟t re-open that. And leave this small category alone.

[Exit S.S. War.

P.M. Agree : reject this proposal.

(b) Widowed mothers. C.P.(63)26

M.P.N.I. As in memm. Cd. go to 19, but not further.

P.M. Mere extension for 1 yr v. unattractive compared with abolition of earnings limit. And v. difficult to defeat Mcleary‟s Bill on this basis.

M.H.L.G. Extend age limit and increase amount of chn‟s allce : see para 6 of earlier paper.

M.Edn. Extension of age by 1 year wd. be welcome as reducing pressure on child to leave school. Also increases mother‟s chance of getting widow‟s pension at age 50.

M.P.N.I. Answer to M.H.G. is in para 4 of earlier paper.

M.W.P.(D) Abolition of earnings rule will increase disparity in total incomes between those who work &amp; those who don‟t. This will generate pressure for increase in basic pension; and it will undermine other earnings rules.

M.P.B.W. People basically dislike earnings rule. We shd. be ready to relax it progressively.

M.H. Widows with chn. are special category : better to give them an increase than to abolish earnings rule – tho‟ latter may be politically wiser.

Ch.Wh. Real point is earnings rule: we shd. abolish it – initially for widowed mothers.

L.P.S. This means abandoning it altogether.

Ch.Exch. A mistake: we shd. have to resist complete abandonment. Therefore avoid initial concession, wh. will generate hopes that we can‟t fulfil.

Ch.Sec. And we can‟t explain why we have changed our minds so late in day – against advice of Advisory Cttee.

M.P.N.I. Only on grounds of selective priority.

Ch.Sec. But why give priority to those who earn over those who can‟t?

M.H.L.G. Chn‟s allces. are right way.

M.P.N.I. But see para 4 of earlier paper. Allces. increased v. recently : and widowed mothers already ahead of other beneficiaries.

M.H. Answer is that widowed mother – whether working or not – is a special class. Better than distinguishing, within this class, between those who work and those who don‟t and giving preference to former, who are already better off.

M.Edn. And increase in age limit for chn‟s allces. better educationally.

M.P.N.I. 1½ m. for abolition of earnings rule for widowed mothers.

1.2 m.

2 m. for all measures – as in present memm.

L.P.S. Tactically better to accept P. Members‟ Bill to abolish earnings rule than to promote Bill of our own.

Ch.Whip. Modify earnings rule for w.m.‟s : raise allces. for chn. to 5/= for all w.m.‟s whether earning or not; raise age to 19. Combn of Regn. and legn.. Cttee may oppose former: no harm in this. Room can be found for Bill.

M.H.L.G. ?Reactions on Nat. Assce. – if very poorest to benefit.

M.P.N.I. Probably yes : 16,000 w.m.‟s receive N.A.

And not easy to increase age limit for w.m.‟s only : cf chn. of sick :&amp; unemployed.

P.M. Cttee on Pensions to work out details for Cab. on Tuesday.

Arranged P.Q. to me on Tuesday promising (in discharge of my promise to make a statement) full statement during debate that day.

[Exit M.P.N.I.

2. Aden. (oral) [Enter S/S.Air. : C.A.S.

Col.Sec. Pending discussions with Aden Govt. We must stay in A: but pro – Nasser party active and U.N. becoming interested.

Fedn. Pro-Br. : therefore tie Aden in with it. Then whole Fedn. is dependent on us for protection against Nasser.

A. already inside Fedn. : a colony within a dependent prot‟ate. etc.

Now assimilate to posn. of other members of Fedn. This – as “indepce. within Fedn.” – will also help moderate party in Aden elections, provided done before elections. Will be criticised as putting Aden under feudal rulers: but will also anticipate risk of indepce. outside Fedn., i.e. pro Nasser move.

Excision of s.b. areas for considn. : but at this stage merely make clear that we reserve this right and intend to stay.

L.Ch. Any precedent for converting colony into protectorate? How do you do it?

P.M. And watch word “indepce.”. We must not risk impression that we are leaving Aden. Also arguable whether we shd. surrender intl. secy. : suppose Fedn. can‟t maintain it – do we go in to restore it?

Col.Sec. Must have special agt. about intl. secy. problems wh. affect base.

But responsy. in principle shd. rest with Fedn., who will be more secure than we cd. bd. If extremists win election, they will press for indepce. outside Fedn..

L.Ch. Watch constitl. implicns. of novel change of status. Unwise to substitute treaty relationship for sovty.

And excision of bases pointless since unviable.

Ch.Sec. Agree : we depend on goodwill to use them. Hence my proposal.

S/S. Air. Only means of remaining in Aden is co-opn. of Fedn. Therefore endorse the proposal, provided no excision of SBA‟s at this stage.

P.M. But keep some hold on, or share in, control over intl. secy.?

S/S ITRD Yes : otherwise we have to intervene, externally, in order to quell disorder.

And Nasser wd. prefer us to stay in Aden to protect Gulf, rather than let it go to S. Arabia.

M.Lab. I agree.

Col.Sec. Will reconsider intl. secy.: what matters is some change in “inferior” status of colony. We can resist U.N. pressure better if Aden is part of Fedn. wh. wants us to stay than if isolated.

F.S. No sovty. at all shd. be ceded. Aden is our only base once we leave Kenya. But popular support also essential.

Whatever soln., Annex D (intl. secy.) and Art 9 (S.B.A.‟s right of excision) of Treaty shd. be preserved.

P.M. L.Ch. to consider constl. aspects.

L.P.S. Legn. will be attacked by Oppn. who will say jobbing.

F.S. Also look at para 15 of D.O.P. memm – O.in C. procedure.

Col.Sec. Yes : but that does not anticipate pressure for indepce. outside Fedn.

P.M. ?Unwise to surrender sovty. over whole area if must then rely on S.B.A.‟s wh. are not viably excisable.

[Exeunt S.S Air &amp; CAS : Col.Sec.

3. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Morocco

F.S. Now reverting to normal arms export policy.

b) Germany

F.S. Forthcoming visit to Bonn desirable. Will maintain policy on E/W credits: and will reaffirm solidarity on Berlin. Will also explore n.a. pact.

S/SITRD. Six have privately agreed to limit credits to 5 yrs. (apart from under-developed countries) qua S.U.: will then try to extend this to N.A.T.O. &amp; O.E.C.D. Wider than original concept.

P.M. Any n.a. pact, embracing Berlin, must safeguard access.

F.S. Germany will oppose it as ratifying status quo and implying recogn of E. Germany.

c) France

F.S. de Gaulle‟s Press confce. on 10 Jan may either disrupt E.E.C. or withdraw France from N.A.T.O. strategy or both!

4. Pay of M.P.‟s and Ministers. (oral)

P.M. Discussed with H. Wilson. Agreed we will both commit next Parlt. to giving this first priority. But something before end of this Parlt. – i.e. joint Resn., including amounts, to be settled by NIC or variant.

Better to settle but not publish – so that not an electoral issue.

M.A.F.F. Awkward to know but not disclose: wd. leak.

L.P.S. Better not to have NIC enquiry until after election. Merely say accept “substantial increase” in principle.

P.M. Launch enquiry now and ask for report quickly after election.

L.Ch. Remember H/Lords : not suitable for NIC

And watch link with higher judiciary.

S/S.ITRD. NIC unsuitable anyhow.

Ch.Sec. But it will secure Oppn. recogn. of NIC. And it is difficult to say that NIC is suitable for other people, but not for us.

One cd. add one or two P.C.‟s and subtract one or two of ordinary members.

Ch.Duchy. I‟m against NIC for this.

S/S.ITRD Agree: we are dealing with busmen‟s wages outside NIC.

M.Edn. There are no analogues to salaries of M.P.‟s and Ministers. Therefore we must settle this ourselves.

F.S. This won‟t carry us over election. NIC and P.C.‟s, with no announcement till after election, is best. Timing of refce. important.

P.M. Monday‟s Cab. shd. consider T. of R. Ch. Exch. to circulate. Decide in light of those.

5. Railwaymen‟s Pay Claim. (oral)

Ch.Exch. Leak unfortunate.

Guillebaud comparison entitles operatives to 12%, salaried staffs much less. Beeching proposes to offer former 5% &amp; settle at 6%. Says he can do without increase in fares and can absorb it also next year. 6% high; but can we reject it and risk strike if no fares increase involved?

M.T. Rly‟s finances have turned corner; and tho‟ 6% increase wd. absorb £18 of £30 m. redn. of deficit otherwise forecast for ‟64, £12 m. wd. still be realised. Increase fully valid on Guillebaud basis; even 6% leaves them 6% behind.

M.Lab. Leak – tho‟ discovered by B. – suggests he is trying to squeeze us.

Recently he said he would settle at 4½%. Now he is recalculating on 5.2% engineering award, wh. is only about 3% on annual basis.

Ch.Exch. B. denies this has affected his view.

M.Lab. Then why has he changed his mind? 6% v. damaging to incomes policy. Nov. ‟62 settlement put them, qua Guillebaud : they shd. start from there, not from 1960.

Ch.Exch. But Nov ‟62 left them behind G. parity because not enough money. Now more money.

M.T. And Nov ‟62 parity wd. require 8% now!

Ch.D. And G. is not gospel.

S/S.ITRD. And Rly‟s Bd is still in deficit. Shd. Govt. subsidise excessive award? What will reactions be in other industries? And wd. there be a strike? Or shd. we lose B.?

Ch.Sec. He can‟t offer less than 6% after leak. That was deliberate technique, wh. B. always adopts.

M.H. Can‟t risk strike if deficit will be reduced despite 6% award and no qun. of increase in fares.

M.P.B.W. No : Exch. shd. not subsidise clear breach of incomes policy.

S/S.ITRD. And inflationary repercussions v. dangerous qua intl. opinion.

Ch.Exch. I agree with M.H., though 5% wd. be better than 6%.

S/S.ITRD. Why not refer railwaymen to NIC like engineers?

Ch.Sec. ?Adjust date - to produce more acceptable annual rate.

1 Jan (as from Nov ‟62) wd. produce 5%.

L.Ch. He shd. start (on 13 Dec) with 4½% or 5% and defer settlement at 6% until New Year.

P.M. Ch. Exch. to explore this in next few days. Cab. then to reconsider.

6. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.
