C.M.(63)3 31 October 1963. 10.30 a.m.

1. Message from Mr. Macmillan. (oral)

P.M. Read Mr. M.‟s reply to Cabinet‟s message.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) W.E.U.

F.S. Atmosphere friendly: private row between Fr. &amp; G. on agricre. but Fr. promised to support K. Round.

b) E.W. relations.

F.S. All agreed to continue probing, except Fr. Even they agreed on nominal objectives – but disagreed on tactics – i.e. let S.U. make first move. I have invited Gromyko to meet me. Must press them again on non-dissemn. and observe posts, eliding M.L.F.

P.M. Sensible to renew contact with G. Berlin a possible – but doubtful - addition. Meeting here rather than Geneva.

But watch Berlin : if G. excepts it from n.a. pact. implies settlement by force. Therefore n.a. pact shd. be accompanied by something about Berlin. Keep in line with U.S. : but don‟t accept their view that n.a. pact is dead.

c) S. Africa.

F.S. Secy. G. may call for sanctions : and we may have to veto. If so, v. embarrassing. Endorse altve. motion promoted by Scandns.

Will circulate memm today: but shd. join in U.S./Scan initiative.

Com.Sec. Agree : must avoid veto on apartheid.

P.M. Beware of vague resoln. (mandatory) wh. leaves our posn. vague. But if a mandatory sanctions resn., must probably veto – not because we approve S.A. but because U.N. shd. not create precedent of imposing ec. sanctions.

d) Algeria

F.S. Cease-fire between Algeria &amp; Morocco. Hope it will work.

3. British Guiana. (oral)

Col.Sec. Parties at Confce. have asked me to settle and have undertaken to accept my decision. I shall give it today.

?P.R. politics and parties identified. Present system produces such large majorities for winners (twice as many seats but virtual parity of vote percentages) as to create frustration. Therefore race &amp; party must be dissociated : and this points to P.R. Must accept risk of “splinters” and try to minimise, after first election, by stipulating minimum qualifying %age.

First elections must be under our control: therefore indepce. must wait till after elections, wh. will take till next summer to organise.

Jagan may resign in protest against this decision. His Party may – or may not - form new Govt. without him. Might be unwise to let them.

If so, may have to revert quickly to Governor‟s rule. Admve. support can be provided. 2 battns. there shd. suffice, with naval reinforcements, to maintain law &amp; order. Police (mainly African!) will co-operate.

If no direct rule, any finl. assce. will depend on Jagan‟s accepting normal Tsy. control – the more the better. If direct rule, cadit quaestio U.S. support us and will encourage S.A. states to endorse in U.N.

Trinidad (Williams) will not want P.R. but racial problem there much less.

F.S. W.E.U. v. opposed to indepce.: hope we will play it slow.

Col.Sec. Execve. powers can be resumed by O. in C. Legve. powers wd. require Act of P. (if not prepared to wait 40 days), wh wd. have to be rushed.

M.Def. 2 Battns. shd. suffice. Reinforce, if necy.: but no immediate preparations.

P.M. Approve.

4. The Queen‟s Speech on the Opening of Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. Too little about C‟wealth. Therefore leave paras 1 and 2: insert new para 3: para 4 continues as in original.

P.M. Approve – subject to verbal reconsidn. [Exit Col.Sec.

L.P.S. Elevate Robbins to new para 9.

Alter first line of old para 15: continue as in old 16: houses to be next para.

Amend old para 21 to take care of Scots posn. on revaluation. New form of words agreed by Ch.Secy. &amp; S. of S. Scot.

Ch.Secy. Original better.

S.ofS.Scot. I agree. Better to revert.

P.M. Agree.

5. Foreign Office Building C.(63)185 and C.P.(63)4

F.S. Now announce as in draft. I accept M.P.B.W. view on architect.

H.S. I agree, qua. H.O. Few small drafting amdts. wh. I will clear.

M.Def. I agree: but avoid any public refce. to implications for Service Depts.

M.P.B.W. I accept this. Must now make statement. May be able to accelerate a bit, if we can hasten Br. St. scheme.

P.M. Let M.P.B.W., Ch.Secy., F.S. &amp; Home Secy. collaborate on a plan for whole area, wh. we cd consider.

M/S.C.R.O. Must inform India a&amp; Pak. as a courtesy, qua I. Office Library.

P.M. How select one architect?

M.P.B.W. Open competns. bad : good men don‟t enter: we are virtually bound to accept winner. Limited competn. unpopular with architects.

Therefore adopt my plan : choose by reference to work done in past and ideas for new bldg. Once we have chosen, we can make archt. design to our specifications.

Home Sec. Jobs for boys? Rely on security arguments?

L.P. A team of architects?

L.Ch. If as M.P.B.W. candidates must produce sketch designs for us to choose from.

M.P.B.W. Agree: but sketch designs alter when translated into functional bldgs.

M.H.L.G. Yes: choice is between M.P.B.W. and paying candidates to work out designs in consultns. with user Depts.

M.P.B.W. Approaches limited competn: unpopular with R.I.B.A.: and involves maxm. of public discord.

P.M. Approve M.P.B.W. proposal. Public presentn. and draft announcement to be revised with Deedes. I. &amp; Pak. to be informed at right moment.

[Exit M/S. C.R.O.

6. White Paper on N.East and Central Scotland. (oral)

S.S.I.T.R.D. Policy agreed, except for:-

i) Erskine Bridge – being examined.

ii) Allocn. of addl. road resources to N.E. – now cleared by

M.T.

On presentation, C.S. needs to be revised : and some strengthening of refces. to social aspects of N.E. Plan.

On timing, 7 Nov. fitted well with original timetable. Now less suitable.

Also 12 Nov. is now earliest possible date technically. Therefore publish on 14 Nov, with appropriate publicity. Meanwhile damp down

misleading travesties already appearing in Press.

M.L.P.(d) Avoid minl. T.V. appearance if a debate. Try to subsume in D. on A.

S.ofS. Scot. Erskine Bridge shd. be included, without cheating! Tay Bridge shd. be finished by 66/67 : E. Bridge unlikely to start till then. Cost will be funded by local authorities : and both cap. and current costs will be met by tolls. Emphasise this in presentn.

Ch.Secy. Must be fitted into existing programme – if necy. at cost of existing items, some of which are in W.P.

Agree on financing : but avoid impression that bridge will go forward, whether or not l.a.‟s play.

Home Sec. Police Bill due to be published on 14th.

Ch.Whip. ?Advance to 13th. But will clash with Housing Bill. Pubn. shd. be early rather than late, in order to bring within scope of D. on A.

P.M. L.P.S. to review publicn. timetable with Ch. Whip &amp; Ministers concerned.

7. Bacon Market Sharing Agreement. (oral)

M.A.F.F. Hope to reach agreement with main suppliers on market sharing. Will be flexible and shd gratify farmers. But they will want tighter control, giving us all we can produce and leaving only balance to imports.

But as market grows, agt. allows domestic &amp; foreign producers‟ shares to grow pari passu: but if it shows preference for domestic product, our share will rise still more. Big curers will also protest: but lots of pigs – wh. is what they want – means lots of deficiency payments!

S.of S.Scot. Scots N.F.U. don‟t dislike it; but regard it as part of whole field of argument about standard quantities etc. But must go ahead.

M.A.F.F. Provision for review after 5 yrs : but we can opt out at 3 months‟ notice.

P.M. Why make this concession to Danes when their b/trade with us is so favourable to them?

Ch.Exch. No concessions: we control their access to our markets, but no vice versa arrangement.

M.A.F.F. Best answer is positive – it is agt. by Danes to limit their access to our markets; i.e. a concession by them to us.

F.S. Dutch want larger quota.

M.A.F.F. Can‟t do more.

On Friday 7 November 1963, Sir Alex Douglas-Home was

elected Member of Parliament for Kinross and West Perth.

He took his seat in the House of Commons on 12 November
