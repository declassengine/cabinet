C.M.(63)12 12 December 1963. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral) [Enter Ch.Whip.

L.P.S. As in statement. Xmas adjournment 20 Dec.: reassembly 14 Jan.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Germany

F.S. My visit a success. Schroeder committed to “mobilisme” &amp; will support any U.K. initiative (particularly observer posts). Less keen on n.a. pact, as freezing division of Germany.

Economic relations with Fr. strained. G. supports K. round. All v. difficult. On Indonesia, President fooled by Sukarno. But Schroeder understands. G will not send arms to I.

b) N.A.T.O.

Minl. Council meeting: I shall make political statement &amp; have discussions with Fr. Govt. about South V. Nam, Thailand &amp; Cambodia where sitn. is unsatisfactory.

S/S.ITRD. If Fr. withdraws from E.E.C., we ought to be ready with some interim arrangement – e.g. linking Five with E.F.T.A.

And is Cambodian confce. wise?

F.S. Won‟t press confce. if unwise. Will discuss with Rusk.

On E.E.C., FO. considering sitn. if E.E.C. breaks down on agriculture.

A Five - E.F.T.A. link wd. be industrial, not agricl.

I will report to Cab. next week.

M.A.F.F. Fr. more likely to veto Six participn in K. round than to withdraw from E.E.C. Effect might be same: but we must consider this hypothesis too.

3. Tribunals of Inquiry. C.P.(63)29

L.Ch. As in memm. Costs main point. Must be ready with assurance and definition of entitlement.

M.W.P.(C) If only ⅔ of costs paid, can still be hard.

P.M. Let me (and Home Sec.) have a note on costs for Denning debate.

I shall propose a Secy. Commission (in agreement with H. Wilson).

Prob. no real pressure for enquiry into „21 Act. wh. wd. then be used even more rarely.

I will discuss costs with L.Ch. Home Sec. and Ch. Sec.

4. Pay of Members of Parlt. &amp; Ministers. (oral)

P.M. Cab. agree on increase: not payable till after Elecn. : then first charge

on time of new Parlt.; based on indept. advice.

H.W. wants Resn., incorporating amounts recommended, before Dissn. Must resist this But on indept. advice?

Ch.Exch. In. N.I. St. Cttee. have recommended £500 for M.P.‟s &amp; £750 for Ministers. Govt. will adopt latter and modify former to £400. We don‟t want a St. Cttee.; but we do need indept. advice.

L.P.S. Backbenchers‟ deputn. accept folly of publishing figure before election.

I prefer NIC - like enquiry.

L.Ch. But must include Lords expert. Therefore wholly indept. body.

L.P. I agree: body shd. have no interest.

F.S. I prefer L.P.S.‟s view.

S/S.ITRD. Industrial experience must be reflected in panel – e.g. Moncton or Chandos.

M.H. I agree with L.P. Body must have no interest : therefore N.I.C.

F.S. But it must have people who know about Parlt.

L.P.S. And must concede something to those who want to do it all ourselves.

M.Lab. If large increases, better proposed by wholly indept. body.

Ch.Duchy. Can‟t rely only on NIC. Therefore ad hoc body better. It shd. be instructed to report to new Govt.

L.Ch. If mixed, NIC must be in majority : i.e. 5 NIC 2 PC‟s &amp; 2 peers.

Ch.Secy. NIC alone best.

M.P.B.W. Bad precedent to associate outsiders with NIC. Best to do it all ourselves.

Ch.Exch. Have a panel of PC‟s to whom N.I.C. cd. turn for advice.

S/S.ITRD. Not NIC: special outside cttee. i.e. ch‟man of NIC plus 2 PC‟s no longer in active Parly. life.

L.Ch. Ch. Exch.‟s proposal better.

P.M. Ch‟man of NIC plus 2, with advisory panel of PC‟s &amp; peers (or preferably two backbenchers &amp; 2 peers).

I will propose to Wilson on basis of report to new Govt. Must aim at statement before Xmas.

N.I. C [?] to delay their announcement till we are ready.

6. Future Agricultural Policy. C.P.(63)31

[Enter Parly Sec. C.R.O. (Tiley)

M.A.F.F. As in memm. Farmers‟ reaction – to new proposals: -

a) inadequate increase in incomes : must not be further depressed on cereal &amp; meat.

b) what assurance of share of growth.

Hence declaration of policy in Annex., drafted on non-committal basis, for use if package deal can be arranged.

On cereals, farmers‟ own proposal (wh. preserves limit on Ease support) is acceptable, and can probably be sold to o‟seas suppliers (tho‟ Australia nervous of our concept of low minimum import price) Must discuss at Jan. confce. Farmers want standard quantity of 10 m. tons as target; Treasury want 8¾ m. tons. 10m tons might jeopardise agt. with o‟sea suppliers. ?Make it 9½ m. tons.

On meat, farmers will not accept standard quantities (as well as for cereals) this year. If so, and growth is reasonable – must make best plans we can as regards o‟sea suppliers. But we have no power to regulate imports; and we shall have no success with o‟sea suppliers unless something is done as regards domestic output. Must settle by Feby. Price Review.

P.M. V. political. Must honour our pledge to provide stability and room for growth. [Exit P.M.

S/S.ITRD. Memm has v. grave implicns. for trade &amp; K. round. “Increasing share” of growing home market has v. far reaching consequences for our trade: and emphasis on quotas will import excessive rigidity into it.

Ch.Exch. I agree: reserve my posn.

M.A.F.F. Unrealistic to suppose farmers will go without opportunity for gaining an “increasing share”. Cf. the Six‟s limit on imports.

F.S. Politically a vital issue: - ¨must be realistic.

S/S.ITRD. But it will ruin the K. round : and Br. agricre. is not competitive – at least with big prairie countries.

L.P. But we can‟t compete with them : we can with anybody else and therefore increasing share, subject to competitiveness, is reasonable.

[Exit L.P.S.

M.A.F.F. And offset by our willingness to review posn. with o‟sea suppliers at intervals. This safeguards e.g. C‟wealth producers on maize &amp; hard wheat.

S/S.S. Scots NFU will break with English NFU if standard quality for meat.

F.S. Further Cab. before any negotns. with foreign suppliers on wheat.

On meat, I favour para 24(b).

M.Lab. So do I.

S/S.S. But better to say merely that we shall not do it this year. Don‟t say that we are merely putting it off.

M.A.F.F. But remember the Supp. Est. (£80 m) in 1961!

F.S. I will consult P.M. about handling.

5. Public Expenditure White Paper. C.P.(63)32

Ch.Exch. As in memm.

F.S. Clarify refce. to aid. We hope to achieve more than this in practice.

Ch.Exch. I will consider this.

L.Ch. Reduction in assistance to agriculture etc! Re-present somehow.

L.P.S. £55 m. extra for aid over 4 yrs. v. small? Group with defence as o‟seas expre.

Ch.Exch. No : don‟t fluff defence. Merely comment separately on aid.

Will settle date of publicn. with L.P.S.

7. Pay of Workers in Nationalised Industries. (oral)

M.Lab. Interim report from cttee. of enquiry into buses this p.m. Defer publicn. till Monday. Will probably lead to offer on lines of L.T.B. offer a week ago!

May be wage trouble in elecy. indy. next month.

Robens will play coal claim slow.
