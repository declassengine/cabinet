C.M.(64)7 28 January 1964. 12 noon

1. Cyprus. (oral) [Enter M.Avn. : S.S. Air : C.I.G.S.

Ch. Whip.

P.M. Sitn. in Island tense. Fighting may be renewed. If so, families must be collected in Nicosia airport, wh. must be seized for this purpose.

M.D. May become involved in G.T. battle for airport, in course of this evacuation. No prior warning to G. &amp; T. Better not to evacuate families in advance, since this might touch off the fighting.

P.M. Agree new directive to High Cmr. and Cdr. B. Forces for this purpose.

A take over of airport wd. be legal under Treaty.

F.S. We have pressed R. Kennedy that U.S. shd share in new peacekeeping force drawn from N.A.T.O. countries. U.S. initially reluctant : now more likely to help. Lemmitzer now visiting Ankara, and may restrain T. Govt. from wanting too large a share.

Makarios, who wants a U.N. force, may reject. But if U.S. share, he may fall in line.

L.S. Some new force essential if deadlock at London talks is not to lead to renewal of communal fighting and to T. invasion (wh. T. now admit is their objective and would be impeded by N.A.T.O. force!)

U.N. force v. difficult. Either Russians are in; or, if they are out, we and U.S. are out also. M. wd. welcome this, with one eye on part played by U.N. force in Congo in enabling “legal” Govt. to repress dissidents.

In the end agreed political soln. may be impossible and physical separation of communities inevitable. Intl. force needed to police that operation and to prevent massacres.

M.D. Little chance of getting force in before collapse of negotns. We may have to withdraw to S.B.A.‟s.

U.S. unlikely to share in force unless M. agrees. If so, must either threaten him that, unless he agrees, we will pull out or assure him, if he agrees, we will protect him against T invasion. That means using U.S. 6th Fleet.

F.S. If N.A.T.O. force fails, we must turn to U.N. force, however disagreeable.

P.M. If partition inevitable, must be either by peace or war. Intl. presence tho‟ not necessarily U.N. – wd. help towards former.

C.S. More likely to get M‟s agreement if U.S. participate.

M.Avn. U.N. force might call in question our S.B.A.‟s.

C.S. Even so, we can‟t commit U.K. any further.

S/S.ITRD. But cd. we hand over to intl. force and withdraw ourselves to S.B.A.‟s?

P.M. Altve. is to take a division out of BAOR! Otherwise we risk either letting our troops be butchered or withdrawing them to S.B.A.‟s.

M.Avn. But we cd. police a partition ourselves and then withdraw to S.B.A.‟s.

S/S. Air. But Gks. won‟t accept a partition!

P.M. Even so, wd. a single handed operation be better than U.N. force.

C.S. We cd. enforce move of 50.000 people on both sides. But we shd. rouse terrible enmity in G. and T. and U.N.

M.D. Must repeat that present forces wd. not suffice to enforce an imposed settlement.

M.W.P.(C) And Gk. Govt. wd. appeal to U.N.

L.Ch. We shd. have no support, domestic or intl., for simple handed attempt to enforce an imposed soln.

C.S. Imposing partition is one thing : supervising one wh. both parties accept is another. Latter requires Intl. force to police it while it is happening de facto.

M.H. If we are to escape odium at point when we retire to S.B.A.‟s, we mustn‟t leave Intl. force too long.

F.S. I will do my best. But U.N. force v. distasteful : Rolz Bennett has said that U.N. wd. only cooperate on basis of unitary state – i.e. surrender to Gks.

[Exeunt. L.P.S. : M.W.P.(C) : M.Avn. : S/S. Air.

2. East Africa. (oral)

P.M. Emergency intervention over weekend essential and well done.

But can‟t accept military responsy. without political authority indefinitely. Therefore DO(O) to review future policy.

Origin of troubles obscure – Communist or Nasser?

M.D. Our public objective must be to get our troops out.

L.P. Even at cost of accepting Commission in E. Africa?

C.P. E.A. Govts. beginning to think collectively of security and may ask for

our help. We must encourage federalisation by e.g. training missions etc.

Discussions with 3 Govts may be next step.

3. Indonesia. (oral)

P.M. Report talks with R. Kennedy. Common aim : risk of divergence methods. R.K. took this and understood that we must give priority to integrity of Malaysia.

Also realised that M. can make no concessions in confce. – including withdrawal of U.K. troops in Borneo. But Sukarno will press for our withdrawal on basis that Asians shd. settle Asian problems : and we must guard against U.S. weakness here.

F.P. R.K. avoided committing U.S. to support us if talks break down.

Accept his suggn. tht we should strengthen our diplomatic initiatives in S.E. Asia.

[Exit C.I.G.S.

4. Agriculture. (oral)

M.A.F.F. Discussions with o‟seas suppliers‟ about import control on wheat and barley in exchange for standard quantities at home and assurance that they would share in growth of market.

U.K. farmers won‟t like restriction of standard quantities. Must therefore start them at right figure. Farmers want level of this year‟s prodn. i.e. 10 m. tons. This wd. reduce imports! Exporters want 9½ m tons or less. N.F.U.‟s won‟t go below 9¾ m. tons.

Right figure is probably 9.7 m. tons, wh. exporters would accept.

[Exit C.S.

Propose therefore P.M. to send messages to U.S., Canada, Australia (?and Argentina) to press them to accept our suggn. of 9.7 m. Even this the exporters may not accept, particularly since dissatisfied about growth assurance. Can‟t go further on assurance about remedial steps, if it all goes wrong.

P.M. N.F.U.‟s may repudiate 9.7 m. tons. Altve. – a band of £9.5-9.9 m. tons?

M.A.F.F. They want 9.5-10 m. tons. The figure of 10 is anathema to exporters.

S/S.S If we break, we must appear to have done our best for our own farmers. Therefore exporters must break, not we.

F.S. 9.7 m. tons wd. be fair and defensible.

P.M. It represents more than was harvested last year and what wd. have been harvested in a good season. But it makes no allowance for growth.

Nevertheless, try it. But try to get exporters to concede 9.75 m, only

conceding 9.7 m. in last resort.

5. Gaming. (oral)

Ch. Exch. Enquiry promised in last Budget now complete. Purely factual ?Publish.

P.M. Yes.
