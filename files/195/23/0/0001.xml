C.C.(63)47 18 July 1963, 10.30am

1. Foreign Affairs (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip; Govt. Whip H/L

F.S. U.N. investign proceeding. Despite public pressure, we must refrain from comment till completed.

2. Nuclear Tests (oral)

P.M. Initial stages of negotns almost too hopeful. But drafting of ban in three environments now in hand. Russians refuse to discuss underground ban: not necy bad – it wd only renew tension. Non-agn pact, now emerging cd embarrass us, if it implied formal recognn of E. Germany. But may find way round, particy if S.U. want test ban. 3rd party adherence to test ban: non dissemn agt: - these are further problems. But if ban succeeds, v. big issues arise: other things may begin to move. Am discussing this with President K. [Exit P.M.

3. Agricultural Policy: Horticulture (C(63)127)

[Enter Att. Gen

M.A.F.F. As in memm. If we are to be free to bargain internlly, we must have time to renovate industry. Tariffs on non sensitive items could be abolished at any time. On sensitive items, bind tariffs and be ready to reduce after say five years – in return for assistance proposed in memm. Industry v. afraid of surpluses in Europe: most of our horticl trade is with EEC. Therefore must create machinery to protect industry from abnormal competn when tariffs reduced.

C.Sec. Must include in statement some refce to need for consult with supplying countries (to protect C/wealth, with whom we have contractural preferences in some cases).

H.S. Ditto qua Guernsey: but they are competve enough to survive somehow.

Ch. Exch. I agree proposals – apart from refce to surpluses. Must say this, but may be v. difficult to do.

Ch.Duchy. Can legn be ready in time to join Ag. Bill? Otherwise January, wh. may be too late. If hortl can be in Q. Speech, statement may be unnecessary.

M.A.F.F. If industry will play, I will try to accelerate legn and let Ch. D. know.

First Secy. This is a political minus!

M. Lab. I agree: there will be a lot of trouble.

P.B.T. But hostl can‟t be excluded from k. Round.

F.S. But that isn‟t till January!

L.P.S. Sensitive list is only binding, not reduction. Therefore politically safe. But may be insufficient to secure quid pro quo of industrial tariff redns in k. round.

M.A.F.F. We are only binding and only enabling ourselves to cut tariffs thereafter if we judge fit. Can emphasise that we shall only do so if hortre looked after properly. Can‟t do less. EEC negotns showed existing hortre system to be a brake on our progress out of all proportion to its real importance. Therefore let me discuss with industry and report in autumn.

M.Lab. Must first be clear about machinery for further protection. Otherwise, industry will not agree.

P.B.T. Shall have to give some indication of policy in GATT before summer.

M.H.L.G. Implications for Lea Valley?

M.A.F.F. If they can get high prices for land, they won‟t worry!

M.W.P. Industry are realistic: they will realise need for modernisation.

M.H. If domestic industry will supply as high a proportion of market as hitherto, no other country will gain anything.

L.P.S. Beware of undertakings about share of markets.

P.B.T. Normal anti-dumping machinery won‟t help.

First Secy. MAFF to proceed as proposed: special care for anti-dumping arrangements: report in autumn: Bill to be drafted forthwith.

4. Parliament (oral)

Ch. Duchy As in statement.

5. Barotseland (oral)

First Secy. I shall have to oppose creation of separate State. But will try to negotiate arrangement within new constn of N.Rh – like Buganda in Uganda.

6. House of Lords Reform: Peerage Bill C.(63)131

Ch. Duchy As in memm H/C. initial reaction to stick to our posn : now ready to let it go. (Ho‟ Lords might give way). By election then inevitable: W

Benn wd probably be unopposed. Posn eased if Swinton amdt were accepted in Lords to-day.

L. Ch. Our case not really strong; and we lost decisively. Lords might not accept Commons rejection, therefore accept postn and Swinton‟s amdt, tho‟ without commitment as regards Commons attitude on main issue.

L.P.S. A row with Lords might be politically useful.

Ch. Whip. No.

First Secy. Then accept.

L. Ch. Altve amdt: a minor who succeeds shd have longer period than 12 months from attaining majority (as at present proposed): choice to be open till age 25. Don‟t risk another defeat: therefore accept.

Ch. Duchy This will be third amdt – all by Lords, all to favour Lords interests. Package deal, wh. Commons accepted without change, now in jeopardy. Proposal was rejected by Select Cttee, by reasonable majority.

First Secy. Leave to L. Ch‟s discretion, to concede if he must, but to resist if he can.

[Exit Att. Gen.

7. Expenses of Members of Parliament (oral)

Ch. Duchy Parallel concession for peers impracticable: revert to London – constcy; this inadequate: therefore abandon.

First Secy. Agree.

[Enter M.P.N.L.

8. Govt Expdre: Estimates for 1964-65. C(63)125 and 129

Ch. Sec. As in memm 9% rate of increase hitherto justifiable on reflationary grounds. This argument no longer available. Two choices – paras 12 and 13. Can‟t prevent substantial increase: but must try to prevent it from getting out of hand. Priorities v. important: also no new commitments without compensating savings: also more critical approach to new projects.

M.H.L.G. Edn more onerous on Budget than housing: in real terms v. Versa. Some shift from rates to taxes will aggravate problem.

M.J. And I shall soon have new proposals for roads.

M.Edn. Public concern about educn rising: we can‟t evade Robbins report and results of our own survey of schools. Both v. expensive. Will submit

proposals in early autumn.

Ch. Exch. Economy is reviving – particy in construction industries. Real risk of renewed inflation and tax increases in Budget.

First Secy. Let Ch. Secy explore priorities and report to Cab.

M. Def. V. difficult: rate of increase in civil expdre recently more rapid than in defence expdre.

Ch. Sec. Longer term survey – ready before Recess – may help a little on 1964-65.

Ch. Exch. And defer proposals to future years as far as possible.

Home Sec. But not at expense of no further announcement of Govt intentions.

M.W.P. Don‟t leave running to critics to make. Hence my proposal. Will discuss with Ch. Exch.

Ch. Sec. I will add something on ‟64-65 to my memm on longer term blocks of expdre?

L.P.S. Doubtfully wise and practicable.

First Secy. Ch. Secy to take into account.

L. Ch. What does (c) mean? Reform of law courts must not be held up.

F.S. And foreign aid?

M. Def. And items in forward costings as they mature?

M. Edn And investt programme (already agreed) for post 1964-65 period?

Home Sec. I cdn‟t accept to propose no new project without compensating savings.

Ch. Duchy. I agree: it wd make eg. Robbins quite unrealistic.

Ch. Exch. Then increase in taxation may be unavoidable.

M. Edn. We can do our best to make savings: but we can‟t do more.

L. Ch. ?Defer expdre on new road signs.

Ch. Sec. No provision in new road programme anyhow.

First Secy. Ch. Secy to re-examine wording of (c ) – in context of memm on longer term blocks of expdre .

M.H. We can‟t endorse basis of MWP‟s memm without further thought, if it commits us to rise in proportion of public expdre in relation to GDP.

First Sec. MWP to discuss with Ch. Exch., &amp; report to Cab.

[Exit MPNL: Ch Whip

[Enter S/S Air: Parly Sec: M.Avn

9. Chalgrove Airfield C(63)130

Home Sec. I side with minority view. But majority, despairing of persuading M. to accept lease, favour taking risks in L. Ch‟s formula.

L. Ch. Covenant binding on company: and tho‟ difficulties of enforcement, company is honourable. If M. will not accept lease and will close manufacturer, we must settle on basis of covenant.

M.A.F.F. Covenant not binding if company sold: and M. is 75. Our pledges to former owners are well known: compromise is not adequate defence.

L. Ch. Covenant remains binding on company, so long as it exists even if sold. And M-B‟s name is well known as mfctr of ejector seats.

Home Sec. If we stipulated a lease or nothing, wd M. really pack up his business? Wd he not accept lease?

SofS Air. M. has been seen twice already. He is eccentric &amp; crotchety. A long lease – eg. 999 years – wd be unacceptable to local residents, who want to get M. out rather than to recover land.

L. Ch. But sale wd be even worse from that point of view!

M.H. I agree with Home Sec. &amp; M.A.F.F. Ejector seats in 21 years may not matter much.

M. Def. Let S/S Air try to persuade M. to accept lease. I will help.

L. Ch. Don‟t let him think that sale is an alternative. We have already offered to sell. Therefore lease must be v. long: it enables us to write in the conditions, wh. is what we want.

SofS. Air Therefore 999 years.

L. Ch. Start with 99: move to 999 if necessary.

First Secy. Agree: with no hint of any altve . Proviso must relate to ejector “equipment” rather than “seats”. T. Sol. to be consulted and to draft lease before M. is seen.

[Exeunt S/S Air: Parly Sec, M. Air

10. Welfare Services: School Meals C(63)126

[Exit M. Def.

M. Edn As in memm L.A.‟s have made it clear that they won‟t object to removal of their option. Saving of £6m. not to be ignored. Robbins apart, educn expre rising: therefore saving can be presented as contribun to expansion in other fields.

SofS. S. S. more sensitive: unemployment still high: and proportion of children taking school meals lower than in E&amp;W and lower than in S. 15 years ago. Therefore political impact v. adverse, especially in rural areas where schools are being closed. New scales no help, since already in force for all practical purposes. In Glasgow, scales more generous therefore reaction to model wd therefore be v. sharp.

Ch. Sec. Unempt no argument. If on N. Assce (after about 2 weeks unempt), no meals charge at all.

Home Sec. S cd stay unchanged – even slightly improve – by using model scheme.

SofS S. But not Glasgow.

L.P.S. Leave this alone: don‟t provoke invitation on this issue, before election.

Home Sec. Political outcry always v. short lived.

Ch. Sec. And we mustn‟t ignore on economy.

M. Edn Especially since even educationalists support increase.

Ch. Duchy I agree with L.P.S.

First Sec. Reconsider in light of Ch. Sec‟s memm on long term blocks of exppdre.

11. Channel Tunnel (oral)

M.T. E.P.C. agreed to consultation with Fr. Govt with view to early publicn of report. Therefore propose to publish in Aug/Sept.

First Secy. Agree.
