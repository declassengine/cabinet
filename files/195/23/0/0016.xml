SIR ALEXANDER DOUGLAS-HOME’S ADMINISTRATION.

C.M.(63)2 24 October 1963. 10.a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. No means of avoiding Lords delay on Prorogation. Therefore compromised on interim debate in Commons : probably no division.

2. Report on Higher Education. (oral)

3. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Algeria

F.S. Moroccans have invaded A : they have appealed to us for arms. Refuse, lest M. appear a Western stooge. If any, shd. be only defensive.

b) W.E.U.

F.S. Prelimy. contacts with French show no signs of co-operation. But I will try, particularly as regards further E.W. talks.

P.M. Let L.P.S. and Ch. Secy. re-examine.

P.M. Corbett, Buchanan &amp; Robbins also affect. Defer until all published.

Ch.Exch. No – early. Shows massive increase and dangers of doing more.

P.M. 400,000 housing target?

L.P. And higher educn. figures are pre-Robbins.

M.Edn. Educn. figures show redn.! Remedied in fact by new stats. : wait till this is made clear in educn. debate in first week of new Parlt.

M.W.P.(D) Expand Part I : and make background to other individual reports to come.

M.H. No harm in delay, provided interval before debate.

M.H.L.G. And don‟t let it conflict with new Bills.
