C.C.(63)57 24 September 1963. 3 p.m.

1. Foreign Affairs. (oral) [Enter Ch.Whip.

a) Indonesia.

F.S. Govt. supervision of factories still questionable. But oil agreement may be signed and For. Minr. more amenable. Therefore wait and see. Amb. to stay.

b) European nuclear deterrent.

M.Def. French offer. Undertake to consider : and evaluate.

F.S. Attempt to organise nuclear defence of Europe round force de frappe. An attempt to make us choose between U.S. and Europe.

2. Buses for Cuba. C.(63)162&amp;164

P.B.T. As in memm. E.C.G.D. cover reasonable on normal commercial grounds. We shd, authorise, despite U.S. objections.

F.S. Neither Fr. nor Germans wd. give corresponding cover. Therefore competn. not there.

Our Ambassador in Havana advises cash over a period.

U.S. wd be v. opposed to credit : and they have helped us over Indonesia. Russia may stop supporting Cuba‟s creditworthiness.

U.S. might retaliate : they have so far turned a blind eye to our continued trade with Cuba – but they cd turn nasty, to us and to our colonies. Therefore cash better, on a phased basis.

M.H.L.G. Firm wd. still want to insure!

F.S. And Cuba in arrears on pre-revolution payments – tho‟ better than other countries.

P.B.T. But they are doing pretty well. And ECGD is commercial, not Govt. credit : it is not aid, nor a subsidy, since repayments exceed loans.

F.S. U.S. wd regard it as equivalent to aid, in their present mood.

M.Def. But 5 year credit wd be normal way of selling buses.

F.S. But Cuba dependent on Russia : and Russia increasingly annoyed with Cuba.

M.T. Still a considerable maritime trade between U.K. &amp; Cuba.

L.P. Maintain it.

P.M. F.S. shd. mention to Rusk, on basis that we shall deal with it in normal, commercial way : P.B.T. shd enable F.S. to present as phased cash payments (avoiding credit) to be guaranteed by ECGD in return for

premium. F.S. to be ready to mention to Rusk on this basis.

Meanwhile contract to go ahead. F.S. shd. present in context of total U.K. trade with Cuba and shd. emphasise we have co-operated successfully with U.S. on trade with Cuba.

3. Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland. (oral)

First Secy. Both Banda and Governor want a monarchical 12 months. Col. Sec. wd not be too embarrassed qua Kenya.

N. Rh. want the same, as a stabilising factor.

P.M. Bad if a pure formality. But here real advantage. Therefore agree.

First Secy. In N.Rh. Europeans object to only 10 reserved seats. I will try to get more, but may fail. Otherwise can settle new constn. without confce.

P.M. Agree.

4. International Monetary Fund. C.(63)161

Ch.Exch. Reserves to support intl. trade must be substantial. Last year‟s Mutual Currency a/c not acceptable. Subsequent discussions have improved posn. Intl. liquidity not inadequate to finance existing trade : but trade may grow and U.S. deficit, which has provided cash for rest of world, may cease. If so, need for reserve will grow. Therefore I shall propose new study of problem and means of solving it. It must enable us to take decisions at Tokyo meeting next year. Europeans now so anxious to control U.S. that will agree to expansion of Fund‟s resources in order to compel U.S., to rely more on Fund

L.P.S. I agree entirely : We have got U.S. moving – don‟t press them too hard.

M.Ed. Don‟t lose sight of M.C. A/c.

P.M. The objectives – a) to get means of dealing with problem which may grow – i.e. mal-distribution of liquidity, including to be ready for elimination of U.S. deficit. b) to have deadline for action – e.g. by Tokyo.

Retain credit for initiative by ourselves.

Ch.Exch. Com. Fin Mns. at today‟s meeting will support us.

5. Public Service Pensions. C.(63)160 [Enter M.P.N.I : M/S.Scotland.

Ch.Sec. Two issues as in memm.

1) Altve. ways of deciding on increases. All objectionable – least so an undertaking to review every 3 years wh. wd do little more than formalise existing procedure but cd. on occasion, be embarrassing.

Therefore leave alone.

2) Pre Grigg widows – i.e. occupational pensions. Cost of concession small : but disastrous precedent – see repercussions. N.B. other ranks‟ widows and pre 1949 civil servants‟ widows, wh are worst of thin ends of wedges. Moreover, altve. method of weighting P.I. Acts in favour of old public service pensioners : tho‟ applicable to all such pensions, it helps pre-Grigg widows.

M.P.N.I. I agree. Those excluded by age from N.I. scheme, and the 10/= widows, are another dangerous field.

On 1) also I agree. Must retain our freedom of action.

M.Def. We shall probably have to do something : question is “when” rather than “whether”. N.I. pensions have kept pace with inflation : public service pensions have not. Erosion is as much as 40% for those who retired in „30‟s.

Other countries concede “parity”. Why don‟t we?

Pre Grigg widows are worst case of this kind. Argument based on those who have no pensions can be used against any increase for those who have.

Therefore, while keeping control in our own laws, give all officers‟ widows‟ same treatment whether bereaved before or after 1958, abolish age qualifica for P.I. Acts (wh limit it to 60), and undertake to review p.s. pensions every 2 years.

Ch.Sec. See my para 9(c) for arg. against parity.

Officers under 60 : if a man retires under 60, he can work or, if unfit, he gets the increase.

Erosion by inflation affects others – e.g. those living on own savings.

Our practice compares well with private sector.

Can‟t revise basis of pension in one case without pressure for some in other cases. Even P.I. Acts leave basis of entitlement intact.

Ch.Duchy. Politically v. contentious – see resns. for Party Conference.

Repercussions of pre-Grigg widow overdone. See paras 20 and 21.

£236,000 and £80,000 = £320,000 for these widows. But £7-8 m. includes paying pensions, for first time. What is really comparable figure for those o.r. widows‟ already receiving pensions? Liability wd then be merely £236,000 and £80,000 + £X.

Ch. Sec. They are in the £236,000.

Home Sec. What about para 24?

M.Def. Irrelevant : we can confine concession to officers‟ widows.

Ch.Exch. But how can one abolish date differentiation for officers‟ widows but

not for o.r.‟s widows.

P.M. Can we at least isolate Services from other repercussions?

M.w.P. Our own supporters think we can.

Home Sec. We can‟t. But might distinguish pre-G. widows from all other classes.

?What wd. formula of defence be – that pre-G. widows already receiving pensions.

Ch.Sec. But it wd concede the point of principle on date.

First Secy. Can‟t avoid reactions on 10/= widow, - about 80,000 in all.

Ch.Duchy. The £236,000, based on distinction in favour of Services, is cheap &amp; defensible. Increase in existing pensions needn‟t spill over to pensions wh. don‟t exist.

Home Sec. No : it will extend to officers‟ own pensions.

Ch.Sec. And to civil servants.

Ch.Exch. And, inevitably to o.r.‟s – and therefore to all other classes who have never had pensions.

P.M. Can we distinguish a) between Armed Forces and rest of public service and b) within Armed Forces between officers and o.r.‟s.

Reflect on this – in reverse order.

M.H.L.G. On first point, private systems are thinking of “growth” arrangements.

Ch.Sec. Avoid any public statement on this.

P.M. Agree. [Exeunt M.P.N.I.

6. Rural Buses. C.(63)152 and 163

M.T. As in memm.

We are subsidising - £86,000 p.a. – bus services in replacement of withdrawn rail services. Elsewhere, there have been no rail services at all. Social &amp; economic grounds require action – by local means (with some Exch. subsidy – Jack said £1 m.) and with local contribn. to cost. At same time, “small man” and voluntary effort shd. be encouraged.

Also Social Survey experiment.

M.H.L.G. Subsidy objectionable, even thro‟ C.C.‟s who will resist having to meet part of cost not covered by rate deficiency grant. Therefore answer is self help, with initial impetus of Excl. subsidy managed by M/T.

Legn. unavoidable – but also for M.T.‟s proposal.

Ch.Exch. Avoid subsidy : and evidence insufficient to justify it.

L.P.S. Why wd. para 7 be inadequate?

M.T. County Councils think it will be.

M.w.P. Pirating no answer : small men don‟t come in and bus companies withdraw.

Home Sec. They will withdraw even more if we subsidise C.C.‟s to run rival shows.

P.M. A regional approach – based on larger unit than arbitrary county – may be needed.

Ch.Sec. But illogical to subsidise services while not setting free individual enterprise.

P.M. Two problems: 1) ?Free small man in appropriate areas.

2) ?In addition, have some subsidy for “proper” buses – in areas where not merely in substitution for withdrawn rail services.

First Sec. Don‟t make public statement until after consultn. with C.C.‟s.

L.P.S. Better to set small man free, even at cost of withdrawal of some bus services.

M.L.P. I agree : set small man free to provide self help.

P.M. Cd. this be restricted to areas where other facilities don‟t exist?

M.H.L.G. Hence my suggestion for experiment.

M.A.F.F. But what a posture for election.

First Secy. Put this on C.C.‟s : and consult them forthwith.

P.M. Give bus companies choice between running services with small subsidy or withdrawing in favour of free enterprise.

M/S. Scot. Any subsidy v. dangerous. All that Scotland needs is “freedom” in limited area of N.W. Highlands.

P.M. Consult C.C.‟s : in light of this discussion and reconsider scheme with regard to result. Consultn. shd. be on basis of “free areas” as well as subsidy. Might suggest experiment by C.C.‟s on lines of para.3.

No action in Scotland for time being.

[Enter M. Avn.

7. Rolls Royce Factory at East Kilbride. C.(63)165

Ch.Exch. As in memm. EPC agree open subsidy objectionable. Any other possibilities, e.g. rent increase, more contracts etc? Now being examined. If no hope here, Cab. will face v. hard choice between blow to E. Kilbride or open subsidy to R.R.

M.Avn. Junior Spey engine &amp; developed Medway engine cd. be put to E.K. if a customer is forthcoming. It wd. not give more work, but wd reduce o‟heads ratio.

One firm might take factory if R.R. pull out. Rent no yet certain.

M.Def. Devt. of Spey and Medway not cheap : and no firm customer in sight.

M.Avn. I agree : implications for Defence budget.

P.M. Continue to explore. Meanwhile no announcement but engine (Medway) to power OR3U, pending discussion of project as a whole. And R.R. to remain put for time being.
