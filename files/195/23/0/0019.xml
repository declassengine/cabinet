C.M.(63)5 14 November 1963. 10.30 a.m.

1. Foreign Affairs. (oral) [Enter Ch.Whip.

a) Iraq

F.S. Internal Ba‟att struggle continuing. Reinforces need for Br. military presence to support Kuwait.

2. Tribunals of Inquiry. C.P.(63)11 [Enter Sol.Gen.

Home Sec. As in memm. Profumo case showed risk of damage to individual reputations by public sittings.

Decision on enquiry is political : if so, must be R.C.

L.Ch. Criticisms of 1921 procedure largely met. They will be renewed in Denning debate : R.C. might be useful – but, if so, volunteer it, don‟t concede it, Chairman (L/Appeal?) v. difficult : either Radcliffe or Denning!

L.P. No enquiry : we concede them too easily and undermine Minl. authority unnecessarily. Difficulties are inherent in nature of problem.

L.Ch. Anything other than „21 Act lacks power. In Act procedure makes private sittings difficult. ?Amend on these two points. Or publish evidence later?

Sol.Gen. Legal profession still v. critical of ‟21 Act procedure. Shd. it not be examined?

M.P.B.W. I support L.P. Too many committees.

P.M. Agree procedure with Oppn. if possible. Must allay public anxiety.

S. Cttee. not a good idea.

L.Ch. Debate in Lords might be valuable – if before Commons Debate on Denning.

Home Sec. If we resist enquiry, will Party support us?

Ch.Whip. No trouble on this. Party will back L.P.‟s views.

P.M. Oppn. might accept no change more willingly from R.C. than from Govt. But I agree on too many enquiries.

L.Ch. Try to get early Lords debate – not on Denning as such, but on „21 Act procedures. But before Commons debate on Denning.

P.M. Agree – Govt. remaining ready to consider proposals for specific changes.

[Exit Sol. Gen.

3. BOAC : Corbett Report. C.P.(63)14

[Enter M.Avn.

M.Avn. B.O.A.C‟s losses by end of year will be £100 m. Hence Corbett, wh. can‟t be published.

W.P. not a bowdlerised version of Corbett : our own analysis, wh. has been accepted by C.

Half loss is bad luck – Comet etc. : other half is bad management. More problems ahead – V.C. 10‟s, growing competn. etc. Therefore change Board : compensn. will be needed : and Guthrie will want £15.000. He must produce, within a year, a plan for commercial viability – Govt. being responsible for any deviations in national interest, wh. shd. be restated. Write off of deficit and future financing shd. wait until plan available. Meanwhile extend borrowing powers to some extent. Merger of B.O.A.C. and B.E.A. shd. also wait until B.O.AC. on its feet : but strengthen links on Boards.

Therefore publish W.P. and announce changes at same time.

P.M. Pressure by Oppn. to see report?

L.Ch. Must resist – as we did with Stedeford.

P.M. The letter about V.C.10‟s.

Com.Sec. I wrote it – v. carefully.

M.H. Even C. can‟t authorise publication – since he got evidence confidentially. But Oppn. will have “private” copies of report: therefore we must be able to say that C. has approved W.P.

M.Avn. Read C.‟s letter: have incorporated his one amdt. of substance.

Otherwise he is content with the document.

Home Sec. Slattery &amp; Smallpeice have not seen report: they are now to be sacked on basis of document based on - what?

L.Ch. ?Insert something to show they weren‟t responsible for whole period.

M.Avn. Smallpeice has been there for 7 years! But Slattery only 3 years, and W.P. makes this clear.

Ch.Secy. If Wilson asks to see C. report confidentially, he will see that W.P. waters down criticism of Govt.

M.Power Surely S&amp;S. shd. see report : otherwise v. unfair to them.

M.Avn. But this wd. give them ammunn. against us, if they wanted to use it.

But might consider it, if departure (including compensn.) settled.

Ch.Exch. £16.000 v. expensive for man who has lost millions!

L.P. Not by business practice!

M.Avn. Risk of leak now v. great: publish tomorrow.

L.Ch. Many typing errors: and last sentence of para 29 must be altered.

M.Def. And amend para 4 – to reduce impression that W.P. is based on C.

L.Ch. Paras 95 and 106(c) v. damaging.

M.P.B.W. Don‟t rest too much on C.‟s acceptance of W.P. Use only defensively, if necessary.

And put some of losses in broader context of national advantage.

M.H.L.G. Yes – plus bad luck. But be candid about really blameworthy bits : Ests Cttee. spotted faults years ago and nothing was done.

M.W.P. If disparity between W.P. and Corbett still too great then amend.

(Deedes)

M.Lab. Logical conclusion of this is to publish C.

M.Avn. But it is unfairly harsh to B.O.A.C. and wd. damage them. Also its proposals are different from ours.

L.Ch. Publish C. and W.P.?

M.Def. No: it wd. provoke demand for public enquiry.

M.H. And it is v. critical of aircraft industry – wh. wd. be damaging.

M.W.P.(D) ?Bring W.P. into line with C. on Govt.‟s share of responsy. and then let Wilson see C. confidentially, if he wants to.

P.M. Damage to aircraft industry valid reason for not publishing C. But must not minimise Govt.‟s share of responsy.

M/Def. Much shorter W.P.? And link with borrowing Bill.

P.M. Defer publicn.. M.W.P. M.Def. Com.Sec. M.P.B.W. Home Sec. shd. re-examine text – on basis of something wh. is not half way to C but is totally different in character – i.e. statement f losses, brief explanation, and proposals.

Deal urgently : then show C. report to S&amp;S.

M.Avn. If their resigns. Leak, shd. I make statement on lines of Annex B, promising W.P. later.

P.M. Perhaps.

Ch.Exch. W.P, even if shorter, must give adequate explann. of vast losses.

[Exit M.Avn.

4. Pensions. C.P.(63)13 [and C(63)137 and 160.]

a) Earnings rule for widowed mothers [Enter M.P.N.I.

P.M. On earnings rule, widowed mothers cost £1¼ m.

Ch.Sec. But a) can‟t hold line between w.m.‟s on one hand and w.‟s and r.ps. on other hand. Cost £100 m.

b) Advisory Cttee give priority to increase allces. to children rather than e. limits of better off widows. This links with our own emphasis on greater selectivity.

c) we have held to Bev. principle of need: departure wd. be inconsistent and appear to be an electoral bribe.

P.M. ?Extend ch. allces (at present 18) to end of univy. educn. or apprenticeship?

M.P.N.I. Cd. extend w.m.‟s own allce. beyond 18 if children still being educated and being maintained at home. But to enlarge ch.‟s own allces. wd. repercuss on family allce. structure and depart from principle that educn. allces. are paid by educn. authorities.

Selectivity, wh. Ch. Secy. stresses, wd. justify something for w.m.‟s: and Advisory Council wd. object less to this than to all round increase in earnings limits.

M.Edn. If change is to be made in educn. context, other candidates (maintenance grants) for considn.

Ch.Exch. We have rejected w.m.‟s before. How justify change now?

M.H.L.G. Back treatment by children rather than w.m.‟s.

L.P. And link with M.Edn.‟s troubles on level of maintenance grants – i.e. disincentive to parents to keep children at school.

b) Service widows

M.Def. Described Grigg widow problem. Cost of £316.000 trivial: repercussions exaggerated. No risk, qua Services, of creating entitlement wh. had not existed before. Precedent qua Civil Service cd. be resisted.

Ch.Secy. Govt. have already admitted to Parlt. that distinctions cd. not be maintained. And they can‟t – on merits. Grigg did create new entitlement for o.r. widows; but to improve off.‟s widows but not

o.r.‟s widows by refce. to date wd. be unfair.

Arbitrary date runs right through public service pension arrangements. If we abandon it in favour of not most deserving cases, we cannot hold it anywhere.

Last P.I. Act (early ‟63) was generous : and was deliberately weighted in favour of widows over 70 – i.e. in favour of pre Grigg widows. Therefore no case on hardship grounds for more relief at present.

M.Def. But no alteration in basic rate : only ⅓ of lower rate.

Can‟t resist any longer, in face of mounting campaign.

M.W.P. Force in argument about o.r. widows who have no pensions.

(Ld. C.)

Home Sec. We cd. withstand civil service, police etc. But division within Forces more difficult.

M.A.F.F. And most likely to affect officers themselves (rather than o.r.‟s), who vary according to same Grigg date.

Ld.Ch. I support Ch. Secy.

Ch.Whip. Strong Party pressure for Grigg widows and w. mothers – all widows.

M.H.L.G. But many better claimants.

M.Edn. And they have benefited already under P.I. Act. I too support Ch. Secy.

P.M. Reconsider next week.

[Exeunt M.P.N.I. and M.W.P. (Ld. C.)

5. Hill Cow Subsidy. C.P.(63)9

M.A.F.F. As in memo. Some 1200 farmers will suffer : but their land has improved and is good for other than livestock rearing. And proposal does not admit farmers who have never had subsidy before.

M.H.L.G. I concur qua Wales (where ⅓ are) provided announced soon and continued through ‟64 to allow time for change.

S.&amp; S.Scot. Scots system (winter keep) different. This wd. eliminate 2/300 farmers, some of whom shd. be. But will come on top of dispute about winter keep.

Therefore defer until appeals on W.K. are disposed of.

M.A.F.F. This is E. &amp; W. only : does not eliminate areas in Scot. and has no direct connection with elimn. of individual farmers for w.k. in Scot.

P.M. Let me, with S.S. Scot. see draft of announcement : Cab. may have to reconsider.
