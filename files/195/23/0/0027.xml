C.M.(63)13 17 December 1963. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip.

L.P.S. As in statement for first week after Recess.

2. Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. (oral)

Ch.Secy. Fedl. public debt distributed between 3 Terrl. Govts. In Nov. Fed. Govt. sent alarmist circular to stockholders. Banks &amp; Insce. Cos. now alerted.

Claim is that security has been reduced and U.K. Govt. shd. therefore provide guarantee : circs. same as when dept. Terry. becomes indept. ,

when we do not guarantee. Therefore bad precedent &amp; damaging to future credit of Terrs. (who don‟t want it). Hence formula.

L.Ch. “Times” says N.Rh. hasn‟t accepted apportionment.

Ch.Secy. Formula means we wd. coerce Terrs. (via cessation of aid or calculn. of amount of aid) if they don‟t honour obligations.

And price of Rh. stock still higher (on Friday) than Kenya stock.

N‟foundland not a precedent: that was a resumption of authy. by U.K.

P.M. Can‟t guarantee. Must rest on formula to give adequate aid if they honour their obligns. Must clarify N. Rh. point before debate.

Ch.Secy. Formula won‟t satisfy City interests.

[Exit Com. Sec.

Ch.Whip. But will probably hold back benches.

3. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) O.P.E.C.

M.W.P.(C) Companies only willing to increase by $100 m. OPEC may react by unilateral action. No action yet : but EPC shd. consider after Xmas.

S/S.ITRD. They have mismanaged this : but Kuwait &amp; Iraq will probably come into line – and if so, extremists will give up.

b) Cambodia

M.W.P.(C) Russia favours intl. confce. to guarantee C. neutrality. We can prob. endorse, subject to careful prepn.

Sihanouk has recalled repves. from London &amp; W‟ton. But must go ahead with confce., rather than jeopardise C. neutrality.

[Enter M. Avn. : S/S. Air.

4. Indonesia. (oral)

M.W.P.(C) Circulated draft statement (today). Djakarta No 1635 reassuring :

I. may retaliate against our commercial interests.

Formula for procedure in event of disagt. on compensn. of companies now agreed.

I. deposit in London a strong card.

If possible substitute “suspend work” for “terminate”.

Arms embargo to be admitted in answer to Suppy.

Com.Sec. Australians still want military involvement to be gradual.

But must consider further.

M.W.P.(C) U.S. attitude also remains unsatisfy.

P.M. F.O./C.R.O. memo. in January. [Exeunt M.Avn. : S/S. Air.

5. Pay of M.P.‟s &amp; Ministers. (oral)

P.M. H. Wilson agrees on (i) statement committing both Parties to act.

(ii) Chn. &amp; Vice Chn. of NIC plus one other, to examine with advisory panel of M.P.‟s etc.

(iii) no report till new Parlt.

Terms of reference? Read draft.

M.Lab. (f) bad.

S/S.ITRD. Also (e) – it is a whole time occupn. for some Oppn. members.

L.P. Solve (e) by remunn. for committee work? And frame T. of R. to allow this to be examined.

M.W.P.(D) Salary, beginning at £400, has always kept in step with value of £.

If so, wd. now be £2400. If NIC went any further, new analogy wd. be created.

L.P. But changes in social circs. wd. justify this.

P.M. L.Ch. M.W.P.(C), L.P.S. and Ch.Whip shd. consider in more detail. Also Ch. Secy.

Com.Sec. And T. of R. shd. include procedure for future changes – i.e. new fixed analogy.

L.Ch. Not appropriate for this cttee.

M.A.F.F. If no more involved than maintenance of £ value, no need for cttee.

But if change of analogy, cttee. not right to consider this.

L.P. But this wdn‟t solve pay of Ministers. Here we need the cttee.

M.A.F.F. But cttee. must receive guidance on whether being M.P. is full time.

L.Ch. They will get it from advisory panel.

Qua Lords don‟t tie to expenses allce.: allow them to answer other methods.

M.Edn. “Right qualities” in (a) : this is not for NIC.

P.M. Can‟t ask Cttee. to relate our salaries to C/L. or Civil Service – or anything else.

M.P.B.W. I agree. Final responsy. must rest with Govt. Link with C/L wd. be disastrous precedent : link with C.S. gives us an interest in increasing C.S. salaries.

Com.Sec. At least establish regular reviews.

P.M. Don‟t ask them to recommend this: it might come at a v. awkward moment.

Advisory panel shd. give advice, not evidence.

Ch.Secy. N.I.C [?] want to announce Members‟ increase (from £1000 to £1350) today.

P.M. Agree : a day or two in advance won‟t hurt.
