C.M.(64)8 30 January 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral)

L.P.S. As in statement.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

F.S. French recogn. of C. China may be prelude to recogn. in U.N. We shall not alter status of our Chargé d‟ Affaires.

Taiwan may be extruded from U.N.

3. Cyprus. (oral) [Enter M. Avn. : S/S. Air.

F.S. U.S. have agreed to make small contribn. to intl. force, under U.K. command.

They want us to make major contribn. (of 4000), drawn to some extent from S.B.A.‟s.

D. trying to make acceptance conditl. on increase in their contribn. No, U.S. want force dependent on invitation from Cyprus Govt. Mak. may refuse.

U.S. also want mediator – in replacement of conference.

They will make every effort to avoid U.N. involvement, tho‟ will inform Sec. Gen.

M.D. Must define powers &amp; modalities of intl. force – e.g. to arrest, disarm, arraign &amp; imprison Cypriots.

Proposed that, if escalation, reinforcement shd. be proportioned to initial contriubn.: for us this might mean a division from Germany.

P.M. 3 months, time limit awkward, if both sides merely stall.

F.S. U.S. agree to look at it again then.

M.D. Initial contribn. must come from NATO: appropriate for trouble in NATO area. (Either from Germany or from NATO mobile force, earmarked unit which is in U.K.)

P.M. Latter preferable. Must put in somethg. – e.g. l battn. – addl. to troops from S.B.A.‟s

M.D. Speed essential. Get U.S. to move 6th Fleet closer and disembark some Marines v. quickly.

[Exeunt M. Avn. : S/S. Air.

4. Holy Loch. C.P.(64)25 and 26 [Enter F.L.A. : Att. Gen.

F.S. As in para 9(a). U.S. may reject. If so, we must either accept their formula (with risk of Parly. trouble) or have memm without any

provision on claims or have no memm.

L.Ch. Watkinson‟s statement v. specific. U.S. now trying to blur or reduce S. of F. Agt. and to substitute provision wh. is meaningless and unenforceable.

Awkward that we ourselves have not legislated for s&amp;a. liability; must do so if to rely on S.of F Agt. Even that wd. cover only personal injury, not damage to property. M/T‟s counter argument not valid : U.S. and S.U. : tho‟ not endorsing s&amp;a liability, have not rejected it. Therefore we shd. legislate, (perhaps with limit).

M.T. Legn. confined to warships acceptable: if extended to merchant vessels, ours wd. be handicapped – U.S. and S.U. won‟t ratify convention.

Other measures – safety at sea – have priority.

P.M. What about U.S. blackmail on steel for our P. submarines?

M.D. Yes. steel is not covered by Nassau: and U.S. voluntary supply unavoidable.

F.L.A. May be all right, since Rickover may be willing to separate the two issues, at least as regards safety clauses.

M.D. But link with indemnity may persist.

L.P. Accept U.S. formula. They wd. have to foot the bill if there were an accident; and we must have the steel.

M.D. We can‟t publicly say that we will forego such protection as S. of F. Agt. provides. Therefore stand on this and accept U.S. formula for rest.

P.A. S. of F. Agt. antedates this : was it even meant to apply to this?

Att. Gen S &amp; a liability applicable to explosion: not to collision, wh might be fault of the other chap.

L.Ch I agree with M.D. But, if we get this, we must legislate: otherwise S of F Agt won‟t bite at all. Therefore proceed as in para 9 (a) &amp; (b) – subject to revision of wording of (b), if possible. Adapt (c) also.

M.D. Let (c) be examined in light of M/S‟s memm.

P.M. Yes – study of legn wh. might be required. Put a) &amp; b) to U.S. through H.M. Amb: special legal emissary later, if necy.; get bill ready under (c), both to put our house in order if U.S. agree and to protect ourselves if they don‟t. L. Ch. to take charge of this: and to consider with F.S. possible modificn of (b).

Att. Gen. Don‟t moderate presentl value of fact that U.S. have ratted on original agt.

[Exeunt F.L.A: Att. Gen.

[Re-enter M. Avn.

5. Ministerial Responsibility for Education. C.P.(64)28.

P.M. As in memm. 1/4 or 1/5 best date.

S/S.S. Balance between unitarion &amp; federal concepts. In presenting, don‟t stress former: otherwise, if unitary in E/W, shd be unitary in S!

M.P.B.W. Avoid too much specific detail in title: begs too many issues in advance.

L.P. And eliminate “Learning”. “Education and Research” is enough.

F.S. Public opinion will expect M. of Edn to be of Cab. Status, if not in Cabinet.

And let S/S. be confined to research and science, including T.T.C.‟s.

L.Ch. I agree : too many extra Ministers.

L.P. S/S. will have too much or too little to do. M.Edn. also a busy man.

But, if adopt F.S., schools might feel demoted. Therefore endorse proposal.

M.Edn. “Edn. and R.” a good title.

One Minister will take all educl. P.Q.s.

Division between two M/S. won‟t necessarily coincide with Deptl. divisions – e.g. Lords one might do Unesco as well as unions. Therefore have two M/S. for Edn. &amp; R. without specifying who does what. It wd., become known v. quickly.

The S/S. will have to deal personally with unions (as F.S. says): additional reason for not specifying M/S. for unions.

M.Power. Load on S/S. will be v. heavy. ?Have separate Minister for Science.

P.M. No : must link science with univs.

M.D. A lot of research done outside univs and R.C.‟s.

L.P. Yes : but I am already M. for Science.

M.P.B.W But better to keep science out of title: then define how much science is to be under S/S. In fact H. Wilson‟s proposals better than ours: don‟t close door to it, but leave way open for diffusion of science through individual Depts.

M.Avn. If drop science, shall seem to be going back on original intentions.

If include it, may offend scientists who feel with M.P.B.W.

M.D. Politically difficult to drop science from title.

P.M. Settle on “Educn. &amp; Science”. Junior Mins. must be P.C.‟s.

L.P.S. Anomalous to put AEA under S/S. Edn.?

L.P. No : it wd. be under S/S. Science. Appropriate now: but may change later.

L.P.S. Odd to have same man supervising training of children &amp; making of H. bombs.

M.Avn. ?Reconsider A.E.A.

M.Power. ?Amalgamate it with my Dept. Wd. ease tension between A.E.A. &amp; C.E.G.B.

P.M. Everybody can establish a claim to it! Leave as proposed : reconsider in light of experience.

S/S. E. &amp; Science : two unspecified M/S. of P.C. status.

Don‟t over emphasise “admve. style” aspect in presentation.

Look at A.E.A. again in due course : and consider further how to link science with Depts. – e.g. R.R.L. &amp; B.R.S.

[Enter M.W.P.(C).

[Exit M. Avn

6. Channel Tunnel. C.P.(64)29 &amp; 30

Ch.Exch. As in memm. Will substitute “channel” for “link” : and will accept prior consultn. with Fr. Announcement therefore agreed.

But to avoid specn. and scandal, must be clear from outset no scope for ordinary equity (tho‟ perhaps for joint guarantee).

M.T. But, statement does not commit us. I thought Cab. had so decided.

L.Ch. But we can‟t until we have had discussions with Fr.

P.M. ?Omit second sentence of first para.

Ch.Exch. Very well.

M.H. And say “further” technical and financial problems”.

L.P.S. But must say that, subject to satisfaction on these, we will go on.

Ch.Exch. Careful. Must first ascertain how much finance of what kind; then decide where it can be fitted into our programme.

M.D. But we cdn‟t say later that it cdn‟t be fitted in: better not to make statement at all.

M.W.P.(D) Must utter before de G.‟s Press confce. : otherwise shall seem to have had our hands forced by him.

M.H. ?Joint statement: both Govt.‟s satisfied on technical &amp; economic merits: further discussions on technical &amp; financial aspects and on resources and timing. And caution about equity.

M.T. As in my para 9?

Ch.Exch. No: not enough protection against specn. May be political uproar if equity excluded (and existing company‟s shares made worthless); but can‟t help it.

S/S.ITRD. Not necessarily : cf. Suez land – charges etc. regulated by Powers party to Convention. Why not same here?

Ch.Exch. Ownership must be public : and Govt. guarantee unavoidable. Therefore no room for equity. Private loan capital – wh Fr. favour – a different matter.

M.P.B.W. Simply say financing will not be discussed – leaving issue open.

Ch.Exch. Add two arguments I have mentioned.

M.W.P.(D) And watch speculation in land. [Exit F.S. : M.W.P.(C)

P.M. Can‟t ruin existing shareholders. Let us discuss further with Fr. before announcement: guard against leak. Say will go ahead, if Fr. go ahead and technical, financial &amp; timing details can be agreed; and anti specn. proviso. L.Ch. : Ch. Exch : M.T. to redraft. H.M. Amb. in Paris to warn de G. today that M.T. will be consulting Fr. counterpart.

7. Cereals. (oral) [Enter Com. Sec.

M.A.F.F. P.M.‟s message to Heads of Govt. on 9¾ m. tons. Well received by Govts. other than U.S. who had despatched message about points of principle on remedial action. They went for a reasonable balance in light of last 3 years‟ experience; if we fall down on this or o‟sea suppliers lose their share of growth of our market, we will take effective corrective action. Their attitude to P.M.‟s message will depend on our reaction to this. We can‟t meet them, at least in advance of K. Round. And better ground of break – if we must break – than difference of 1m tons. But a pity: U.S. &amp; others wd accept 9.75 m. tons; and we shd. make this clear to them, especially since they have not consulted the others on remedial action and the others have not made similar démarche. Might also concede some addition to our own

remedial formula.

P.M. No : row with our own farmers. Otherwise, agree M.A.F.F. shd. tackle U.S. as proposed.

8. Cyprus. (oral)

Col.Sec. U.S. practically agreed to share in intl. force. Greece, Turkey &amp; the two communities will be more difficult.
