C.M.(64)3 14 January 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral) [Enter Ch.Whip.

L.P.S. As in statement.

2. Cyprus. (oral)

F.S. Secy. Gen. appointed Indian to survey Cyprus sitn. before appointing repve. Observer at confce. therefore fallen by way. Will try to revive idea of repve. in Cyprus.

3. Economic Prospects for 1964. C.P.(64)3 : Public Expenditure

C.P.(64)8.

[Enter Parly. Sec. M.P.B.W.

Ch.Exch. Expansion now vigorous on nearly all fronts. Still taking up slack: can‟t therefore sustain current rate and must switch to long term expre. in 1964. Will create problems for certain areas and industries.

B/P will turn down next year – mainly because of imports. Therefore some demand on reserves in latter half of year. Can accept this, subject to 3 points in para 6. on third, competn. and incomes policy must go hand in hand. On latter NEDC discussns. going quite well : may get grudging co-opn. from unions and acceptance by both sides of need to keep prices stable.

S/S.ITRD. Agree. Private investt. will rise in ‟64 and in ‟65 by more than was thought in October. Tribute to modernn. of industry. Important to emphasise differences from 1959 – e.g. role of NEDC – in order to allay fears of repetition of that year.

Recent measures have had great impact in N.E.: but we must hold firmly to boundaries of growth zone. Other regions all right : except possibly S.W. Important to absorb surplus labour in areas wh. need labour. (Decision on Woolwich Arsenal right). S.W. Merseyside &amp; Central Scot. are areas which want more industry : D. of I. policy being reconsidered for this purpose.

NEDC must concentrate on prices, despite unions reluctance. We must help by all means e.g. liberalising trade from satellites if they will use sterling to buy Br. exports and will refrain from dumping.

M.Lab. Only fear is that sitn. may get worse than Ch./Exch. thinks – owing to volatility of private industry. Must keep spotlight on prices, particularly export prices.

Prosperous industries are overmanned; it is here that we must press for release of surplus labour (rather than e.g. trying to run down labour in coalfields). Difficult problem for management.

L.P.S. Stress differences from 1959 – particularly on B/P. Sounder posn. now.

But watch incomes policy: better to show NEDC as concerned with prices rather than incomes.

Weak spot is bldg. indy. : it is on this weak indy. that load will be heaviest.

F.S. Impact on aid?

Ch.Exch. Disbursements tend to lag behind programme. But programme provides for steadily rising level and commitments will continue to rise.

L.P. Must accommodate Robbins‟ expedre on univy. expansion somehow.

Ch.Sec. But current proposals go further, particy. on student numbers than we have accepted. Will discuss with L.P.

In amplification of 6(i) of C.P.(64)3, see C.P.(64)8. Next years‟ increase over this year will be 6.2%; and tho‟ lower than last year, circs. are v. different. Hence my proposals in para 19, especially holding 3% in reserve for summer decision on public service investt. programme &amp; restraining increase in defence works. Also para 19(c).

These measures essential if 6.2% increase not to be damaging.

M.T. Channel Tunnel? Fr. will want to do it. Do we stand aside?

Ch.Sec. Consider at E.P.C. But must consider in relation to other projects.

Ch.Duchy. On incomes policy, no agreement with unions before election.

But they won‟t want to appear to be dragging their feet. We must therefore play them carefully.

M.H.L.G. Must settle priorities on home front, if each Minister is not to frustrate others.

And must go for larger bldg. indy. (? by transferring surplus labour from other industries).

S/S.ITRD. This needs a psychological break through, to put across new methods etc. Must maintain pressure on bldg. indy., even at cost of maintaining some degree of overload on it.

On prices, some engineering employers have increased prices by more than wages settlement justified. Not all employers are helpful!

Global approach by economy out of date : must have more selective means of using surplus resources.

M.T. Pointless to modernise bldg indy. without modernising designers who set the task and customers who foot the bill.

S/S.Scot. In Scot. large pool of labour wh. cd. be used locally or in England.

Agree with S/S.ITRD. on more discriminating instrument.

Must avoid “stop-go” psychology if we are to harmonise regional and national policies.

Parly Sec. National Bldg Agency : establishment of dimensional coordn – all these

MPBW. will do the trick. But for next two years must be v. careful : hence I support Ch. Sec‟s proposals, provided no programmes already announced are cut back.

Ch.Exch. Then no additions either!

M.Edn. In my field LEA‟s will achieve permitted rate of starts. Don‟t cut back.

M.H. Great scope for Depts. to enforce modernisation of bldg. indy. by their demands : and in time this will have effect on private sector.

P.M. Let E.P.C. consider - and report to Cab – on modernn. of bldg. indy. and any further steps Govt. cd. take to promote it. Defer decision on 3% cut till then.

M.Edn. Crises of 55, 57 &amp; 61 were precipitated by speculative pressure on £. This was touched off by Private investt. boom. But mustn‟t hit this too hard; otherwise confidence destroyed. Therefore can we rely on intl. help in holding B/P posn. without having to repress private investt.?

Ch.Exch. Probably – so long as economy basically sound.

M.Def. Defence works important : impact on recruiting. No hasty decision on barracks.

On major works – I have to meet other Deptl. demands. And must take long view : can‟t refrain from decisions in 70‟s – they have already been taken in principle (e.g. Hunter replacement.)

Home Sec. Hitherto, Tsy. too late in slowing down &amp; much too late in starting up again.

Public service has no reserve for sustaining rate of planned advance.

?Strengthen higher ranks to provide greater flexibility.

P.M. Accept Ch.Exch.‟s general aims in para 6.

But when will specve. pressure on £ develop : and what will be signs?

Ch.Exch. Usually by mid year, when U.K. and R.S.A. B/P will deteriorate normally and reserves will fall. If confidence wavered at same time (and election was still to come) people over world will shorten commitments and withdraw £. Won‟t necy. happen: but may.

M.W.P.(D) Some of our thinking shd. be candidly exposed. Must avoid any impression of concealment. I will discuss with Ch. Exch.

[Exit Parly Sec. M.P.B.W.

4. Resale Price Maintenance C.P.(64)13

S/S.ITRD. R.p.m, and monopolies etc, v. relevant to modernisation.

Now generally agreed that r.p.m. shd. go over whole field. (This was implicit in Committee‟s review). This is one of factors wh. wd. show difference between 1964 and earlier inflationary periods. A test of Govt.‟s determination.

Both Lab &amp; Lib Parties support it : Consumer Council support it : general expectation that r.p.m. will go. But how? Depends on economic impact required and politics.

No compromise adequate. Thus :-

(a) Case by case : Mon Cmn. or R.P. Court. Refce. to court difficult.

M.C. can‟t consider r.p.m. as such : legn. needed to enable it. This means delay. Also legn. wd. have to prescribe criteria. M.C. wd. have to deal in 40-50 groups, wh. wd. take 6-10 years.

L.Ch. Statement that r.p.m. on way out wd. suffice. But can‟t take away people‟s livelihood without some judgement. Therefore establish small body, with national interest as sole criterion. Their judgement shd suffice : no Order.

S/S.ITRD. Wd. still take time.

(b) Of R.P.C. legn. needed and justiciable issue wd. have to be defined. V. time consuming. Moreover R.P.C. deals with written agreements : but r.p.m. is not an agreement but a unilateral desire of manufacturer, enforced by various means.

Therefore R.P.C. procedure wd. also require fresh form of pleadings. This wd. be practically unworkable.

L.Ch. Don‟t dissent : but must give people some means of pleading their case.

M.Def. R.P.C. at least removed issue from H/Commons to a “judicial” atmosphere.

L.P.S. But it is H/C‟s job to deal with political decisions, if necy. case by case.

S/S.ITRD. This won‟t intimidate others. Cf R.P.C.‟s experience so far. It has dealt with 160: 400 remain: some waited till last minute before changing. R.p.m. wd. be the same, whenever mfctrs. and retailers wanted it. In grocery self service stores were large enough to withstand mfctrs. &amp; suppliers. But not true elsewhere. (c) Third compromise – merely deal with electrical goods (M.C.‟s report) and take powers for rest in new session. But M.C.‟s consent affected only

some of electrical components for cars. Cdn‟t justify discriminatory approach. Pending report on wallpapers wd. repeat dilemma.

Therefore provide cushioning for pharmacists and books by some means; and by allowing time in other cases. But abolish r.p.m. in interests of modernisation: and don‟t fear reaction of vested interests, who are themselves divided. V. short Bill, making r.p.m. a criminal offence.

L.Ch. Not appropriate. If no written agreement, how cd. prosecution prove it?

H.S. Abolish but give S/S. power to delay, by Order, applicn. to e.g. books, pending judgement by indept., ad hoc tribunal.

M.H. Abolish r.p.m., including pharmacists, if necy.. They will complain; and we may have to provide some cushioning. But this remuneration under NHS is based on wholesale costs of ingredients and wd. therefore be unaffected. (They wd. lose profit on cameras, toilet accessories etc.)

Ch.Duchy. Complaints from all quarters will be v. heavy. Bad for Party.

Also many people think r.p.m. has a use; and it has been exonerated in case of books &amp; tobacco. May be other cases. Therefore unjust to abolish at one swoop.

Monopolies &amp; mergers are to be dealt with later : so small man is hit first : bad politically.

Therefore adopt compromise in some form or other : and deal with electrical goods &amp; wallpapers in this session.

Ch.Exch. We don‟t refer a tariff change to a judicial body! These are political decisions, to be taken by Govt. on broad grounds; they are not “justiciable” issues.

L.P. Books &amp; tobacco emerged by accident. How can we condemn other cases without a hearing?

S/S.ITRD. M.C. dealt with tobacco in context of monopolies &amp; said r.p.m. shd. continue as protection to retailers. If we deal with monopolies, this argument disappears.

L.Ch. I agree with L.P. We don‟t take away a man‟s land without right of appeal. We shdn‟t take away his livelihood without similar right.

M.D. Any procedure for exemption wd. have to be judicial in character.

P.M. I favour abolition : but I am advised that it wd. be electorally disastrous.

Therefore reverse process – put cases to be protected to tribunal early and then hit the others. ?Use strengthened M.C. for this purpose.

H.S. I agree : protect chemists, tobacconists &amp; confectioners : also books.

M.D. But that is merely politics : it is not justice.

S/S.ITRD. Abolition of r.p.m. may lead to reinstatement of delivery cost to remote areas.

L.P.S. It may also compel small retailer to reduce his prices to level of supermarket or to go out of business. Electoral folly.

Ch.Sec. Even short Bill, enacted in this session, cd. hardly operate until after election. Fears wd. be at maximum; and prices wd. be unaffected. Worst of all courses.

M.H.L.G. But r.p.m. is an electoral issue anyhow. We must take a robust line about it.

L.P. Robust = unjust. Some form of tribunal wd. be both robust and just.

L.Ch. Yes: and put time limit on submission of cases.

M.A.F.F. What is scope of r.p.m.? Are we really ready to say that all of it is wrong?

M.Edn. Must at least say general presumption is that r.p.m. is wrong. This will create fuss in any case. Do we gain by holding back?

Ch.Duchy. It is at this point that justice comes in.

F.S. Must maintain momentum on monopolies etc. i.e. must hit big people as well as small ones. But some court of appeal must be created for r.p.m.

P.M. ?Say general presumption r.p.m. national interest; require most arguable cases to some form of tribunal quickly.

Ch.Exch. Why not to H/C?

M.Def. No time : and confine H/C. to big issue that r.p.m. is in principle bad. Leave detailed cases to a tribunal.

S/S.ITRD. V. weak. The Speed enquiry covered all the groups: there is no new material or argument to be deployed.

M.H.L.G. Legislate to abolish – with right to reinstate if can satisfy tribunal (to be established subsequently).

P.M. Outright abolition too dangerous politically, unless issue of justice can be dealt with.

L.Ch. To include professions in services v. doubtful.

M.T. Equally so in case of intl. shipping.

P.M. S/S. ITRD., L.Ch. &amp; M. Def. to draft statement, on basis that r.p.m. is against national interest, that appeals will be allowed, but that action will be swift.
