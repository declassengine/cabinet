C.C.(63)50 30 July 1963. 11.30 a.m.

[Enter Ch.Whip : 3 Service Mins : Min. Avn. : C.D.S. : C of S

1. Future Defence Policy. C.(63)141

M.Def: As in memm. Only one carrier in qun not a programme.

But 3 the minimum if we are to have an E. of Suez role.

Nuclear propuln. : U.S. v. doubtful whether it will be economic.

Ch.Exch. See para 6. Accept 3 carriers as min. if retain role. Doubtful we shall retain it : but can‟t discard it now.

Therefore accept one new carrier – but in replacement of second ie. (Ark Royal), wh. did not go to sea till 1955 and will therefore have been in service only 16 years by 1971, ie. less than Victorious to date.

M.Def. Can we announce now that order will be placed?

M.Avn. Accept Ch. Exch‟s proposal. We can‟t replace V, having lost a year.

P.M. Decide a 3 carrier fleet. But public presentn.?

S&amp;S Air. I accept.

Ch.Exch. Must we place order now – if replacement is for A. Royal?

M.Def. Read draft statement.

M.T. Starting date determined by our slowness in building warships. Why so slow?

M.Def. I will discuss expedition with M.T.

F.L.A. Victorious had modernisation : A.R. did not. Hence difference in life. A.R. will be finished by 1972.

If n. propuln. we shd. have to redesign. We can‟t change half way. Therefore must commit ourselves now to conventional propuln.,, since risk too great on ship of this kind. But experiment with eg. frigate.

P.M. Announce today together with comm. aircraft.

2. Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. (oral)

P.M. Congratulate L.P.

L.P. Thank you.
