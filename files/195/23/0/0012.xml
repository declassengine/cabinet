1. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) Malaysia

L.P.S. Temperature reduced – but only temporarily? No real change of attitude. : A Maphilindo Summit. Tunku ready to go – but shd he resist on prior recognition. Evacn. of Br. subjects from Balikpapan in hand : but Br. properties not yet restored.

P.M. D.O.P.C. must examine our preparations.

L.P.S. F.S. has talked to Gromyko. He wants progress but hesitates on observn. posts unless linked with denuclearisation of Germany.

c) Congo

L.P.S. U. Thant insisting on 6000, rather than 3000, for U.N. force. Might settle for 5000. U.K. contribn. wd. be 1.5, not 1.1 as agreed. Ch.Sec has agreed – but only if necessary.

2. Kenya. (oral)

Com.Sec. Negotns. being v. difficult. Kanu gaining upper hand : and pressing for

major constl. changes, wh. wd destroy minority safeguards. Do we concede these or leave Kanu to declare intention to make them after indepce. In neither event cd we get a Bill through Parlt. I will plug on and report.

Kanu may become more moderate : and I wd concede some relaxn. of procedure for changing constn. without too fundamental changes.

Must keep Eurs. happy : discuss with Home Sec. possy. of restoring Br. naty. to Eurs. who stay, become Kenyans &amp; lose Br. naty., and then change minds.

Com.Sec. Para 5. Separate refce to Zanzibar unnecy. Will consult Legal Advisers.

Ratificatn of Test Ban treaty shd come in either P. or O. speech : preferably former.

Para 21. Restore usual formula.

4. Horticulture. C.(63)176

M.A.F.F. Can‟t maintain in context of K. Round, tariffs as main means of protection.

Draft statement now agreed with Tsy and industry‟s leaders. In return for improvements to H.I. Scheme industry will accept some redn. in tariffs, binding of tariffs on sensitive items and eventual redn. of sensitive tariffs in internatl. bargaining. I must use formula in letter to industry as well as making statement.

Arrangement ad refm. to executive council. If they approve, good : if not, must consider whether we approve.

P.B.T. V. satisfactory. Must keep sensitive list as small as possible and keep hands free to reduce these at end of 4-year period.

Com.Sec. From Com. point of view, contractual preferences will have to be

renegotiated. Cyprus &amp; Malta have only non-contractl prefs : essential to help Malta as much as possible. Insert some refce to para 5 to discussion with interested Com. suppliers.

M.A.F.F. But this is common to all items affected by K. round.

P.M. Leave alone : sensitive items don‟t arise for 4 years.

Put most emphasis on improved grading and marketing : least emphasis on sensitive tariffs.

First Secy. Para 8. Are there means of prevention?

M.A.F.F. Yes.

Ch.Sec. Opening sentence, implying same methods, inconsistent with formula.

P.M. Substitute formula for opening sentence? No. Sentence gives rather less : keep formula for later use. e.g. Election Manifesto.

5. Severance Payments. C.(63)169 [Enter M.P.N.I.

M.Lab. As in memm. Formal discussns. next : with commitment to legislate?

Yes, to make it realistic : but initially confined to redundancy.

Aim at (separate) Bill by Jany.

L.Ch. Redundancy yes: whole field no – an unfair burden on small employers and an interference with freedom of contract.

Even redundancy scheme difficult : a) nothing for man leaving of own accord - but suppose it is on advice of his doctor?

b) scheme stops at O.A.P. age: but why?

c) exclusions in para. 13. (: domestic servants) not easy to defend.

Ch.Duchy. Only point is commitment to legislation. Avoid it.

M.Lab. I agree redundancy only : but don‟t be too deterred by its difficulties, since it is going to happen. But can I promise legn.?

P.M. Put refce. to discussns. in Q. Speech. – with both sides of industry – and leave it there.

M.P.N.I. I support legv e. commitment – as making more realistic. But both sides of industry wd. prefer redundancy to be dealt with by wage related benefits and will think our scheme only a means of evading this. Hence importance of demonstrating that we are serious about our scheme.

P.M. Can‟t commit selves to legn. But make clear we are serious.

M.Lab. I would settle for refce in Q. Speech.

Ch.Sec. It is too wide : must include refce to redundancy.

P.M. “Discussns. have been started with both sides of industry with a view to dealing with redundancy by sev. pay for long service employees”. [If reach agreement, can contemplate legn. : and this can be said in discussns.]

M.Lab. I will agree form of words with M.P.N.I. and Ch. Secy.

P.M. Keep wage related benefit for Election Manefesto.

6. Rates. C.(63)167 and 172

M.H.L.G. As in memm. Patchy scheme : and discretionary help in hardship cases will not be popular – extra works for L.A.‟s, means test, and only

£13 m. as against £100 m. But best I can do.

Ch.Duchy. Even so, politically v. important to us, even at cost of means test.

And all explicitly interim, pending Allen, Buchanan et al.

Ch.Sec. That is important : we must emphasise that we shall review, within Govt. Machine, incidence of burden as between rates &amp; taxes.

That makes it a presentable package.

S.S.Scot. We faced this some years ago. We ignored it: it died away. But incidence of burden a v. live issue.

If done in E. &amp; W. must be done in Scot. : but will be said being done for Party political reasons in E. &amp; W.

M.P.N.I. Individual relief complicated by N.A. wh. caters for increase in rates.

How arrange a separate test of hardship?

M.H.L.G. By exclusion of N.A. cases from L.A. scheme of relief. Even so defn. of hardship not easy – possibly same formula as for L. Aid.

M.P.N.I. Difficult for N.A. Bd. who have to do calculns. for L. Aid. scheme.

Home Sec. a) is bad : blatantly political help for low rated areas.

M.H.L.G. True: but only way of helping them. b) alone won‟t help them enough.

M.L.P. Base interim measures on an interim indication of Allen‟s findings?

M.A.F.F. And refer to our own review : it is educn. expre. which is putting up rates.

Home Sec. Nothing excuses helping Bournemouth but not other places where rates are higher.

Ch.Sec. Can defend it as interim measure to help those with disproportionately sharp increase.

S.ofS.Scot. This wd. aggravate reaction in Scot.

P.M. We cd defend this interim action if next Budget were going to shift burden from rates to taxes.

Ch.Sec Not much room for this, unless taxn is increased.

M.Edn. And constl change in resony for educn wd be necessary.

Home Sec. No dify some other grant – eg. Police?

Ch.Sec. No : not a piecemeal approach to problem of our review.

P.M. Explore it.

M.Edn. Don‟t increase an isolated %age grant.

P.M. Consider further.
