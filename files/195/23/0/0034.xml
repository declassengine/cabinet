C.M.(64)6 23 January 1964. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament. (oral) [Enter Ch.Whip.

L.P.S. As in statement.

2. Foreign Affairs. (oral)

a) W.E.U.

M.W.P.(C) 2 day meeting started.

b) Cyprus

C.S. Sitn. in C. v. tense : fighting may be renewed.

Confce. in London v. sticky : trying, by separate conversations, to produce document as agreed basis for collective discussion. Will hurry on.

c) Tanganyika and Zanzibar

C.S. Calm restored for the moment : but how long? Govt. did capitulate to Army mutiny and Army loyalty now not reliable. H.M. Ships standing by. Some Br. protected persons killed. Nyerere innocent: but the others?

Zanzibar v. troubled : a revy. Govt. divided within itself.

Uganda shaky : Kenya apprehensive about Army – but there are Br. troops there.

All v. unfortunate for constn. advance in S. Rh. How can we encourage Field to accelerate African advancement?

Can‟t recognise Zanzibar Govt.: but must look after Sultan – perhaps by adjusting payment for Coastal Strip, whose assets (which he recently surrendered to us) were his property. H.O. must cope with accommodating him &amp; his retinue.

P.M. If Kenya army mutinied, wd. Br. troops have to protect Kenyatta?

M.D. to consider their role, in consultn. with C.S.

Sooner or later must decide how to deal with crypto-Communist infiltration of C‟wealth countries in Africa. D.O.P. to consider.

C.S. Altve. to Kenyatta prob. Odinga – Chinese controlled!

3. Indonesia. (oral)

M.W.P.(C) T. &amp; S. have agreed to 3 partite meeting of F. Mins. on 2 Feb. T. may have waived preconditions about recogn. Must now wait for Kennedy‟s visit.

P.M. Watch T.‟s propensity to concede. We have common purpose with U.S. in halting Chinese penetration of S.E. Asia. But means differ – U.S. anxious to prevent I from going Communist, we concerned with integrity of M.

If T. makes no concessions, we may appear in U.S. eyes to be wrecking their policy. But if T. agreed to withdrawal of U.K. troops

Borneo wd. be lost. Wd. T. commit suicide? He might, by inadvertence. Even so, must try for political settlement, since altve. even worse.

4. Govt. Expenditure after 1968. C.P.(64)19

Ch.Exch. As in memm : relevant to next three items.

Savings already high : therefore tax increases might be unavoidable (even if 4% growth target achieved) unless expre kept under control. Momentum of existing programme will run on into ‟70.‟s without any more net additions.

L.P. See para 10. We are committed to Robbins proposals : but U.G.C. have now said this needs new bldg. starts in ‟64 and ‟65. If this is agreed, it is not “optional” : it is inevitable.

Ch.Sec. But U.G.C. themselves can‟t yet justify extra starts in detail.

If they can, my principle must apply.

S/S. S. Has credit from e.g. Ch. Tunnel or Decmn been taken into account? Wd it increase growth rate?

Ch.Exch. Can‟t say : but what determines investt. is resources available now.

M.Lab. Regional policies may involve more expdre: if so, must try to cut some existing commitments.

L.P. Have we been too generous on social benefits? Shd. we try to cut back here – if politically possible!

M.P.B.W. Room for manoeuvre confined to unannounced commitments.

L.P. Even there, expectations are already aroused.

M.Edn. Proportion of G.N.P. taken by Govt. Expre. has been rising since ‟56. But no political row about this : public opinion accepts it and process might be allowed – politically – to go a little further.

Ch.Exch. Yes : tax redns. need no longer be first priority. But tax increases shouldn‟t be, either.

M.H. In Ch. Tun. case big expdre will arise in 4 years. By then we may be in a recession! Therefore merely recognise now that any new commitment may require cut back when time comes.

[Absent for an interval.] [Enter H.S.

M.Lab. In terms of resources, even manpower will become increasingly short, with existing programmes. Hence risk of renewed wages pressure.

But retain regional flexibility.

Ch.Exch. 4% target assumes full employment.

Must settle priorities on political &amp; economic merits and then consider where savings can be made.

5. School Leaving Age. C.P.(64)21

L.P.S. Raise in second year (to help Scotland) : and reconsider in e.g. 1966.

M. Edn. Can‟t stall. Can‟t reject, for political reasons. Much of extra cost cd. be accommodated within existing programmes, if normal improvements deferred.

Politically unrealistic to argue that, if so, they shd. be deferred anyhow.

On date, if ac. year 70/71, little overlap with Ch. Tunnel : and cd. always be postponed.

[Exit C.S.

6. Shop Hours. C.P.(64)22

H.S. As in memm. See para 5.

L.P.S. Avoid “no intention to leg. in this Session”, unless necessary.

L.Ch. Be non committal even so. If agreed report, might be a short Bill.

P.M. Approve.

[Exit H.S.

5. Resumed discussion on School Leaving Age

Ch.Duchy. I endorse M. Edns. proposal.

L.Ch. Parents may object.

M.Edn. If not till 70/71, public opinion wd. accept.

Ch.Sec. Real capital cost is £150 m. Deferment of normal improvements (not yet in any approved programme) immaterial? Current costs might be as high as £65 m. Once announced, could not be postponed.

S/S. S. Accept 70/71 (grateful for deferment) subject to enough teachers being available by then.

Ch.Exch. ?Link with age of entry.

M.Edn. Can‟t anticipate (Lady) Plowden‟s Report. But, if we raise leaving age, Cttee more likely to propose raising entry age.

L.P. Say 70/71 the provisional date?

M.Edn. 69/70 wd. be first bldg. programme to be affected. Shd. therefore have until 1967 to consider deferment. Don‟t want to make it conditional on teachers, since this wd. commit us to full Robbins target. Also avoid “provisional”.

P.M. Wording to be agreed between M.Edn. and Ch.Secy.

7. Channel Tunnel. C.P.(64)20

L.P.S. Why can‟t money be put up privately?

Ch.Exch. Because they wd. want Govt. guarantee. i.e. = money from Govts.

L.P. Do we want it at all? Yes. Increase of traffic exceeding expectations.

M.T. Politically, Fr. want it and might offer to do whole thing.

M.W.P.(C) Rejection wd. be affront to Europe. [Exit M.H.

Ch.Exch. If so – and if (as I believe) must be publicly financed – something else must be given up.

M.T. Must settle by end Jan : otherwise Fr. will leak.

M.P.B.W. But can‟t say publicly that will do it only if some cut made elsewhere.

This will generate growth &amp; revenue.

Ch.Exch. Must retain public image of financial responsibility.

M.H.L.G. Say, if – when time comes – can‟t be fitted in, something must be cut.

P.M. Let Ch.Exch. discuss with M.T. form of words : return to Cabinet.

8. Holy Loch. C.P.(64)17

M.D. As in memm. Our bargaining posn. weak, since we rely on U.S. for supply of certain POLARIS components wh. are outside P. Agreement.

F.S., L.Ch. and I (with Law Officers, S/S. S etc) shd. try to ascertain best bargain we cd. try for and advise P.M.

P.M. Must come back to Cab. Agree.
