  <content>C.C.84(58) 10th December, 1958
1. Integration of N.A.T.O. Air Defence. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Recalled earlier discussion. Have seen Norstadt, who understands our diffies.
Sought a formula – tels. to and fro’ Roberts.
D.S. New formua. We shall still assign our forces to Saceur in peace &amp; war. That is
inevitable : speed &amp; need for integrated control. But (Annex) Govtl. safeguards
are clearly stated.
Approved.
2. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
Believe Oppn. will ask for debate on Cyprus – tho’ H.G. knows that it wd. be
better to avoid it.
P.M. We can refuse it.
A.L.B. Might do them more harm than good.
3. Obscene Publications Bill.
R.A.B. Bill cd. be amended in Cttee. But ought to be dicussed first on 2nd. Rdg.
K. Also – differing views among Ministers on substance – as reflected in my Cttee.
R.A.B. Don’t wish Govt. to appear to be obstructing : much feeling among intelligentsia
and publishers in favour of amendg law.
I.M. Can’t give Govt. time w’out upsetting promoters of other Bills.
R.A.B. x/ We shd. make it clear that we want it discussed in H/C. in Private Members’ time
: but block this week on ground there isn’t enough time for a proper discussion.
P.M. x/ mght be made clear on Business Statement next week.
4. Gas and Electricity Borrowing Bill.
M. In ’54 Bill on el. and gas borrowg. Proposed to do same again. But gas borrowg.
not needed before ’61. H.A. wd. prefer p’poning gas part of legn. I favour going
on with whole picture – on basis of getting authy. to borrow tho’ not immediately
needed.
H.A. H/C. dislikes being asked for authn. far in advance. M/P. point cd. be met by
explaing. gas posn. on this Bill, tho’ limitg its provns. to electricity.
RAB )
 
 
E.H. ) Leave it out.
R.M. Logical to deal with both together – we are supposed to co-ordinate them.
H. Politically, better to omit gas.
Agreed : State full picture but seek powers only for electricity.
5. Foreign Affairs.
S.Ll. a) Cyprus. U.N. debate was v. satisfactory. Skilful handling by us. U.S.
support at critical time, on instructns. from W’ton.
b) Iraq. Can’t be sure what has happened. Not certain this was Egyptian
plot.
c) Europe. 4-Power Mtg. on Sun. on Berlin. On Mon, mtg of O.E.E.C.
NATO begins on Tuesday.
On Berlin, G. Govt. are satisfied with my statement in F.A. debate.
x| Our line, vis-á-vis Russians, shd. be tht. we can’t discuss Berlin in isolation but
| only as part of wider ques of G.’s unity.
D.S. y| Want 3 Power study of action needed in a blockade of Berlin – mil. and civil.
Hope this will be borne in mind.
P.M. Expects report from H.A. next week, in light of OEEC discussion – so tht. Cab.
can decide our response to action of Messina Powers.
On Berlin, we can prs. afford to wait a little. Thereafter, our policy shd. prob. be
one wh. has some plan and appeal. Stressing x/ and linking it with idea of
Summit mtg.
S.Ll. Wd. advise going slow on arrangemts. Wd. not favour y/ yet.
P.M. Let G. remain doubtful for a time. G. can afford to supply Berlin themselves.
6. Defence - Man Power Policy.
D.S. No reason to fear that we shall be unable to carry thro’ our policy of ending N.S.
Act.
P.M. I had thght earlier tht., if this was not clear, it wd. be honest to pass legn. before
demitting power.
D.S. No reason to modify policy. Recruiting has gone better than we hoped.
A.L.B. Hope there will be chance of discussing later wtr we need larger forces. – w’in
limits of Regular recruiting.
S.Ll. This memo. allays my earlier fears.
I.M. Certain now there is no risk tht. policy will fail.
 
 
7. Malta.
A.L.B. Seeking formula promising “Dominion status” – or not excldg. it – if Malta
became viable &amp; our defence needs change.
H. “Self-govt. w’in Commonwealth” is only safe phrase.
P.M. Be careful about formula. What we mean is Singapore model.
A.L.B. Object : to get some allies in Malta.
Agreed : A.L.B. to consult H. on terms of formula. and consult
Cabinet, if anything is to be said.
A.L.B. Singapore won’t satisfy them : they have had it for years, and don’t like
comparison with Asiaties.
May be that this is a futile exercise.
P.M. Rely rather on infinite capacity for flexible arrangemts.
8. Cotton Imports.
D.E. Not going well. H.K. Insistg. on escalation. Also askg. for something on
towelling.
A.L.B. Is there v. much between them? H.K. fear is tht. whole world is ganging up v.
them. As we have agreed on total figures &amp; a carry-over : can’t we avoid
expressing it in terms of escalation by relying on carry-over. Cdn’t Lancs. accept
that?
P.M. V. critical situation. Seeing Rochdale tomorrow.
D.E. If you accept escalator for H.Kong, you will lose Indian agreement.
P.M. Seek a formula using carry-over vice escalator.
And get Rochdale to put that to Lancs. –
Cabinet must then decide, before Xmas, wtr we abandon all attempt to impose
sanction on Colony.
e.g. Warn H.K. Govt. that we shall impose a settlement.
9. Coal.
H. Cd. we have a report? Lanark pit : being closed now – after being scheduled for
re-developmt. and actually modernised last year.
M. Have met H/C. Sc. Cttee. : seeing Beaumont.
J.M. Want certainty about it.
M. Can’t while N.C.B. are discussing with Unions. These are at present proposals.
