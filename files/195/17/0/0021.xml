  <content>C.C.30(58) 14th April, 1958
1. The Budget. [Enter E.H.
No note taken.
2. Aden.
P.M. Outlined situation in Lahej and the steps authorised for its redress. Jifri brothers
are to be arrested and deported to St. Helena.
A.L.B. Support decisions taken by Def. Cttee. Won’t shock people much : most of earlier
members of Lahej dynasty have spent most of their time in Seychelles.
J.H. Cd. they not be detained in Aden?
A.L.B. No : wd. be focus for dissension.
P.M. Must now study long-term policy for Colony &amp; Protectorate. Ordinary
Commonwealth policy hardly applies ; for these countries won’t become
independent &amp; they wd. sell their freedom to Egypt.
S.Ll. Shall have to endure (European) Commn. of Human Rights.
M. Objective of policy : protect M/E. oil. Value of Aden = military. Doubt if we
shall ever use military means to protect our oil interests. Shd. we not therefore
concentrate on protecting them by cementing Arab good-will.
A.L.B. Yes : but Gulf States wd. be shaken if Lahej went over to Nasser.
P.M. We can’t hold Protectorate much longer by 19th. Cent. methods, while Arab
nationalism grows around it.
S.Ll. Yes : but wrong to thrust Br. democratic system on them.
[Are we going to face this (Yemen) alone or rely on international organisation e.g.
U.N.]
A.L.B. May Govr. use his existing resources to jam propaganda b’casts by Cairo and
Yemen.
Agreed.
S.Ll. Shd. we not bring in Sec. Genl. U.N. on our side to prevent Nasser’s infiltration
into Aden &amp; Protectorate.
