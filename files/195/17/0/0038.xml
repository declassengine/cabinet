  <content>C.C.54(58) 11th July, 1958
1. Defence Organisation. [4 Def. Ministers, 4 C.O.S., E.H.
P.M. Valuable discn. y’day. Frank talk useful.
`My views : (1) statement must be made before end/July. on pol. grounds.
(2) when? Wd. prefer Tuesday. Dislike delay. Want to be free
too to seize opportunity to meet T. &amp; G. over Cyprus.
(3) substance. White Paper? Wiser because diffy. of dealing
orally with supplementaries on details of organisation. When
it comes to debate, easier for Govt. to base it on a Wh. Paper :
better debate all round.
R.A.B. Agree : clearly on (1) and (2). Point (3) is more open : for P.M. who will have to
make the statement.
Favour substance of draft – with introduction.
K. Agree. Wd. weaken our posn. if we failed to announce a concln. Favour Wh.
Paper.
I.M. Argument for statement. Can’t define relns. of Ministers in writing : unusual also
to disclose composn. of Cab. Cttees.
Doubt if policy is sound : out of date. Preparing for wrong war : minor opns.
(most likely) 3 C.O.S. is more appropte.
H. Must have a public statement. With revisions W. Paper will stand. Wd. prefer to
have it in W. Paper.
H.A. Agree.
A.J. W. Paper implies gt. change. Cab. Cttee. organn. not normally disclosed. Def. Bd.
is not v. new – existg. Serv. Ministers’ Cttee. CDS is only a change of name.
Wdn’t a statement be better on basis we are m’taing. status quo.
Hail. Disposed to agree with I.M. and A.J. But that doesn’t meet our pol. diffy. Sitn. in
Press &amp; Parlt. may get out of hand. W. Paper will imply Cab. is not divided.
Ch.H. Want a W. Paper. Easier to handle.
C.S. Statement stopping at “confirmed”?
P.M. No : Press speculn. has gone too far. A damaging debate might be v. dangerous to
Govt.
Discussion of proposed amendments C.147.
P.M. Spoke on management of a flexible Def. Cttee.
Shd. list of members be published? Arguments pro and con. On balance – best to
use language wh. indicates Serv. Ministers will be included in membership.
Caution re Confidential Annexes.
Paras. 9-10.
 
 
P.M. D.S. wd. be willing to omit para. 9 from published paper.
Para. 10.
A.L.B. Awkward to define reln. betwn. a Minister and P.M. cf. Col. Govrs. It is in my
discretion to decide which Col. Govrs. I submit to P.M.
Para. 10 approved.
Para. 9.
K. Prefer to keep it. Ensures that decns. are not taken w’out proper informn.
Paras. 20-21.
PM. Agreed in principle. But plans aren’t made. Better not therefore to say this
publicly at this stage. Agreed.
Paras. 17-19.
CIGS. The word CDS. still opens up possibility of Supremo. Cd. you not drop the
name? He is now no more than Chairman.
C.A.S. Support this request.
P.M. Don’t exploit your advantage unduly. We want the title. All the interests of
C.O.S. are safeguarded.
C.A.S. Admit new formula meets point raised yesterday.
P.M. Diff. problem – not because of personalities but because of system is hard to work
&amp; ought now to be defined for Parlt.
Despite some differences, hope we can be united &amp; present united front in this.
Diffies. of planning – to deter major war, not to fight it : be ready for lesser opns. &amp;
to work w’in economic limits.
M/D. was asked by Cab. to assist Ty. in this.
All depends on spirit of co-opn. Hope we can have this spirit. I am at the service
of you all.
