1. Pensions. [Enter B-C., J.S., E.H., O.G.
a) Quinquennial increase.
P.M. Case for our plan is that it puts pensions on a sound financial basis. Damaging
therefore that it shd. be arguable that it involves continuing deficits for 20 years.
Hence proposal of M/P. to advance first quinquennial increase by one year and to
make Exchequer contribn. also subject to quinquennial increase, thus restoring
equal tri-partite character of plan.
B.C. Exchequer point is v. important. But I’m ready to leave it over, in W. Paper so as
to enable H.A. to join in discussion of that.
P.M. Awkward to make this major change after first announcement – wd. seem to be
yielding to pressure.
J.S. Exchequer increase is made at start – from £125 M. to £170 M.
I.M. 1965 is not 5 years from any date – R. Assent or introdn. – obviously chosen
solely to balance the figures. Deficits are relatively small. On reflectn. not in
favour of earlier date.
J.S. Moreover, calculns. are based on uncertain factors. Think, however, figures are on
high side presentationally; and I therefore favour making first review at 1965.
K. 1965 cd. be justified as middle of decade.
P.M. Deficits in App. II are marginal cpd. with those on p.4.
M. Gt. disadvantage if Exch. doesn’t share in quinquennial increases.
J.S. H.A. was disturbed at original increase of Exch. contn. He wd. wish his
alternative method to be considered further before agreeing to give increase for
Exchequer.
P.M. On balance : don’t advance first quin. increase by 1 year. Deficits are small in
reln. to turnover.
K. Still think that wd. be bad, presentationally.
H. Makes it more unpopular qua increased burden. May help to be able to say that,
even with these increases, there will be small deficit.
P.M. Increase of earnings at 2% is low.
M. Cdn’t argue that publicly.
H.W. Support H. Contns. are v. heavy already. Greatest danger is criticism tht. contns.
will be too heavy.
 
 
P.M. Believe that, if we advance it by one year, we shall need Exchequer increase as
well. If we stand on paper as drafted, we cd. have Exchequer contn. constant.
As H.A. is away &amp; has so little time here, I’m inclined to publish W. Paper as it
stands.
Agreed : publish W. Paper as printed, w’out alteration.
b) Popular version.
P.M. Better avoid controversy over this. Let it be handled by Central Office.
c) Draft White Paper.
I.M. Assumptn. of 3% unemploymt. (p.4). Arguable that we shd. take more credit for
new assumptn. I wd. prefer that we shd. not – dangerous.
P.M. Why not add : “if unemplt. averged 4% the excess of expenditure over income
wd. be larger.”
* [And] add also reference to earlier assumptions e.g. Beveridge’s 8%
K. App. II – “on Govt. instructions”. Agreed.
B.C. Govt. Actuary wishes this to be made clear in reln. to unemplt. and to contractgout.
P.M. * Then add also, in resp. of unemplt., the earlier assumptn. Agreed.
[Exit B.C.
2. Tin. [Enter V-M.
V.M. Price has broken. Contrary to expectns., it has not fallen v. far. D.E. seeing State
Dpt.; but no likelihood that U.S. will help. Seems there may be chance tht. R.
will join in.
A.L.B. M’while pol. re-actions in Malya, Nigeria etc., have not bn. bad.
K. C.R.O. wd. be glad if contact with U.S. cd. be m’tained thro’ joint econ. measures
machinery – wh. is considering needs of Malaya generally.
V.M. Reply to R. note is being drafted by F.O. and D/T.
3. Aluminium.
V.M. R. were given alternative – &amp; are offering to limit their exports to escape antidumping
measures by us.
[Exit V-M.
4. Foreign Affairs.
a) Far East.
O.G. No progress in Warsaw talks. But no sign of Ch. desire to break them off.
Serious situation if they did.
 
 
Local situation at Quemoy is stalemate. Caution on both sides. Supply improvg :
looks as tho’ island cd. stand out for 60 days.
P.M. T.U.C. have asked to see me to-day.
I.M. Disturbed about that. Hard to refuse. But they are playing politics. U.K.
influence is being exercised thro’ P.M.’s personal contact with Eis. Cd. not that
be brght. out in statement after interview.
H. Agree : Press shd. be made aware tht. Labour line is danger to peace.
b) Cyprus.
P.M. Makarios’ new scheme.
Gk. campaign v. appointment of T. repve. in Cyprus &amp; remainder/plan.
Spaak is proposing conference incldg. T. &amp; G. Govts as well as Cypriots.
Latest indication : Menderes may appoint as T. repve. the existing T. Consul Genl.
in Cyprus, as a temporary arrangement. If true, puts T. Govt. in v. favourable
position.
Will not reply to Spaak until after S.Ll. has returned.
L.O.’s shd. advise formally on Lausanne Treaty point.
F.O. shd. put the case, with K.’s help.
c) Middle East.
P.M. Thing’s not going so well in Lebanon. But slower w’drawal of U.S. troops will
defer diff. crisis for us in Jordan.
O.G. S. Genl.’s report will be submd. to U.N. on Tuesd.
