1. Industrial Disputes : Railways. [Enter E.H., A.N.
I.M. Posn, is less gloomy than appeared last p.m. Clerks Union don’t want strike : may
seek interview with P.M. ASLEF wd. prefer to avoid it : no money. In N.U.R.
opinions divided.
Mtg. of 3 Unions may not be held this p.m. If it does, danger of strike. If
therefore it is called, propose to send message invitg. them to see me. But, if mtg
is not held, sitn. wd. be still in negotn. stage &amp; I wdn’t intervene.
H.W. I agree.
P.M. If moderate views prevail, they will see R. again or ask to see M/L. or P.M. If
they go to R., important he shd. go no further. He has played a card (July/Oct.)
we had hoped to be able to play ourselves at later stage. Will he be tempted to go
further. Wiser for him to prompt them now to approach Govt. Advise him not to
go any further.
H.A. i) Hope means will be found to get them to see P.M. before strike is called.
R.A.B. Agree – Govt. had better handle it from now on.
I.M. Invitn. wd. be to come &amp; see me to-morrow at 10 a.m.
Agreed : procedure to be as above.
2. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
Whitsun recess. Wd. have announced 2 wks. to-day. But in view of strike posn.,
wd. be wiser to defer announcement.
Death of Ruff-side, late Speaker. Wd. wish, after Business statement to express
regret &amp; sympathy with relatives. But there is no precedent for doing so. No
formal motion, which shd. be reserved for former P.M.’s and other outstanding
figures. Agreed.
Cttee. of Privileges : Propose we leave this until after Whitsun.
3. Parliament : Expenses of Members.
R.A.B. Some Members are urging tht. when M.P. goes to constituency by car he shd. be
entitled to 1st. class rlway fare.
H.A. Cdn’t be done w’out amendment of Parly. resoln.
Was considered by Sel. Cttee. (?’45) who recommended only travel by train or air.
P.M. Play this slow. No change at present.
1. Industrial Disputes (resumed)
 
 
P.M. Let us take stock of position. If there is comprehensive transport strike, sitn. will
be grave. All possible emergency prepns. made, but these will suffice only to feed
the people.
Must be clear about objects of struggle &amp; means of ending it. In 2-3 wks.
industrial life wd. be largely at stand-still. Then, either i) men wd. accept R.’s
terms. ii) general mood of p. opinion tht. compromise must be found to end it –
formula somewhat better than R. has offered. iii) resignn. of Govt. wd. be forced
– because volunteers insufficient to keep life going. iii) wd. be clear defeat. ii)
might well be as bad.
If we have to fight this battle, we have to reckon with risk that Morris L.J. will
give an award to miners (expected at end/May) which, being statutory, is
mandatory on us. Finally, we must get posn. in wh. attitude of rlway leaders is so
unreasonable tht. our adherence to our principle (no more money for rlways) does
not appear pedantic. Otherwise we shan’t have support of p. opinion – or get
willing volunteers.
When I decided to see both sides, I did so because Forster Commn. had said : no
more money in till, therefore can’t have more wages : in effect this meant no
wage increase “at present” – tho’ wages don’t compare favourably with those in
other industries. My approach was therefore to see wtr the 3 parties cd. not do
somethg. to put some more money in till – by economies etc.,
H.A. Accept this appreciation.
Another complication – c/living figure may be 110 (2 points up) but won’t come
out until 23/5.
If a strike, most likely outcome will be settlement with some element of
compromise. What cd. that be? What room have we for manoeuvre? I see only
one possibility – turn into long-term settlement of some kind stemming fr.
progressive economies over next 2 yrs. E.g. 2% at Oct., 2% at Apl., &amp;
conceivably another instalment in Oct. ’59
...........
H. Cd. R. quantify savings to extent to justify e.g. 2½% in Oct.
H.W. He can’t be sure how fast he can go because of pol. pressures etc., Diff. to
quantify before July.
H. Not even if T.U.’s are co-operatg.
H.W. We wd. be accused of giving wages again on promises vice performance.
G.Ll. Diffy. of presentn. Sitn. is v. diff. from 1926. There was a revolutionary
atmosphere post-war : &amp; public saw strikes as such a threat. It isn’t so to-day.
No atmosphere of bitterness. Public won’t see this as a challenge to Govt. This
stresses importce. of appearing to have made every effort to avert it.
On other hand w’spread dislike of giving wages on promise of co-opn.
Ch.H. Policy : no extra money to £250 M. or to this year’s allocation of it. Provided we
stick to policy tht. money for extra wages must be found w’in resources of B.T.C.,
any compromise is defensible – so long as resources can be genuinely foreseen.
Stress advantage to all of anti-inflationary policy. That is being lost sight of.
H.W. By July/Aug. train cuts etc., wd. be in hand. But Oct. before we cd. quantify.
 
 
J.M. Effect on confidence abroad?
H.A. V. diff to judge. We have assumed Govt. climb-down wd. have worst effect.
Prolonged strike wd. be bad. Phased increase plan – wd. depend on what was
happening elsewhere on wages.
R.A.B. Emergency plans.
Military : maximum 200,000. Latest estimate : 70.000 – 94.000 is maximum
available. Only 74.000 manned vehicles – from Army &amp; R.A.F. Build-up of
vehicles : 4.000 a week.
Preparatory steps wh. wd. be provocative must be taken soon – e.g. taking
vehicles out of moth-balls.
E.C.(58)2 will be circulated to Cabinet. E.C.(58)1. on oil.
Offls. for Regions chosen &amp; briefed. Ministers ready, tho’ not briefed.
Procln. of emergency ready. Also Bill on picketing.
Posters etc., for appeal for volunteers.
Stocks : retailers have 2 wks’ stock.
200/300 trains a day. cf. 40.000 a day – passenger &amp; freight.
We can’t know what sitn. mght be like. We can’t offer immedte. pay increase.
But we shd. enter on strike only if satisfied tht. we have done all we can to avert
it.
P.M. Diffy. is a moral one. We have set out to get econ. in balance. We have had some
success. Economy has bn. a little deflated. But in private industry, some, still a
big profit margin &amp; despite our monetary measures they have bn. free to increase
wages. Others have had to reduce. On balance, however, wages have risen in
private sector. Weakness : only sector we control (rlways) men have best case for
some increase. We can’t control agric. wages : or gas. electr. or coal because
arbitns. are binding on us by statute. Thus, if wage award given to miners’ or if c/l.
index goes up 2 points, at height of dispute we are in embarrassing posn. Only
sector in wh. we can enforce our genl. econ. policy is one where we &amp; public
have prs. greatest sympathy with the men.
Problem now – how evaluate savings &amp; when begin to share it out. I fear
evaluation. Experts will whittle it away. I wd. prefer to rely on performance –
honesty of intention to make the savings – offer to pay when it is seen that
savings are beginning to accrue. Meet in July : P.M. to preside : get reports on
what has bn. done and what progress is being made. If satisfied that it is moving
on basis of memo. of understanding, then say 2% : look again in Jan. &amp; agree on
further 2%.
Ch.H. Wd. be consistent with our genl. policy to accept monthly mtgs. to review
progress of economies.
H. A p’mme.
H.W. Yes : so long as you don’t give wage increase in advance.
J.H. Definite promise of 2% in Oct.?
E.H. Feeling in H/C. – mtg. last p.m. accurately reported in Times this a.m. Any wage
increase must come fr. actual savings. Nothing shd. be given on basis of mere
promises.
 
 
If they felt that anti-inflation policy was being abandoned, a no. of moderate
supporters wd. w’hold support – and abstain on a division.
4. Butter. [Enter V.M.
H.A. Summarised various alternatives. Views of E.P.C. Rejected £5M. plan, as most
unlikely to satisfy N.Z. Fin. assistance to N.Z. dairy industry direct wd. be v.
dangerous precedent – not only with A &amp; N.Z. but with other Doms. and
Colonies.
E.P.C. therefore concluded tht. best course was to go for voluntary agreemt. with
countries concerned. If that failed in resp. of any country, be ready to impose
counter-vailing duty on that country. Full of diffies. in GATT ; and other
repercussions. But we passed the Act : and can’t explain to N.Z. why we shdn’t
use it.
V.M. Distinguish betwn. action v. countries subject of complaint and any private repns.
to others.
H. Case put by N.Z. has bn. proved. Favour use of duties, either directly or as
proposed by E.P.C. – I prefer latter course. But we shall have to say
i) quantities must be acceptable to us &amp; N.Z.
ii) time-limit.
Skinner shd. accept this.
Think there shd. be a credit – but only in return for concession by them on
preference discn.
V.M. Shd. inform Skinner before he goes to Denmark. Statement shd. be made in H/C.
on Tuesday.
R.M. From my angle, avoid row with N.Z. at this time.
J.H. Butter consumptn. rising because price competitive with marg. If price goes up
too much, consumptn. wd. drop.
H., V.M., &amp; J.H. to explain decns. to Skinner.
On credit refer him to H.A.
