  <content>C.C.2(58) 3rd January, 1958
Government Expenditure.
D.S. Nil on “inducements”. But offer another £5 M. on miscellaneous further
economies.
R.A.B. Civil. With increase of stamp, announce a ceiling on cost of N.H.S. Wd. reduce
risk on wages. If £22 M. found that way, we can’t do more than another £10 M.
on civil – and I wd. favour 6d. for welfare milk.
H.A. I wd. sooner do it all on stamp – 10d. for that and nothg. on milk.
P.T. I wd. prefer R.A.B.’s suggn.
P.M. Can we decide that somewhere betwn. £25-30 M. must be found from civil side :
composn. to be determined.
On defence : if you announce in Feb/Mar. the whole scheme of improvemts in
Service pay &amp; allowances, it ought surely to be possible to say that it operates
from 1/7. Wd. that make much difference to man engaging or re-engaging. Three
months’ delay will save £9 M.
That wd. give gross total of £112-117.
P.T. Figure for Service pay include £7 M. for “improvement”. That shd. not be
conceded anyway – at time when wage claims are so difficult. This leaves £28
M. P’pone introductn. for 3 mos. &amp; you wd. get another £7. Giving total cut on
Service pay etc., of £14 M.
H.W. Service date suggd. is Feb. This is when there may be arbitn. award to rlways.
We shall be trying to prevent more going to rlwaymen. Awkward to increase
Service pay at that moment.
D.S. Remember our plan was to make the increase in the autumn. We deferred in
deference to P.T. &amp; on his assurance tht. it wd. come in in Estimates.
P.M. Suppose we agree to get £25-30 M. more off civil expenditure.
P.T. Service pay : I must ask that element of betterment shd. be excluded. I put that at
£7 M.
D.S. Some element of betterment is essential to success of recruiting.
I.M. I wd. accept £25-30 M. as contn. from civil side.
P.M. On defence : get £9 M. by deferring whole plan until 1/7., or adjust the plan qua
betterment to get about same amount : e.g. by introducing pay but withholding
most of allowances.
H.W. Betterment doesn’t weigh with me : it’s postponement that matters.
J.H. Bitter disappointment in Army at p’ponement.
P.M. Not surely at announcement of operation from 1/7.
 
 
After discn. assume £30 M. off civil. Giving firm total : £115 M.
After adjournment for 30 minutes –
K. P.T.’s diffy. is over C. Estimates. If he cd. have £30 M. by savings &amp; charges in
welfare – Stamp £22 M. at 8d. : eyes £4½-7 M : milk £10 : boarding £11 M.
Thus, unless stamp went to 10d., some other contribution must be found w’in
welfare field.
P.M. This means he wants whole of the £30 out of welfare group.
Re-enter P.T.
P.M. Let us constates position of 3 groups – def., social services, Ty.
My proposition was for total of £115. [76 agreed + further 9 from defence + £30
from social services.]
P.T. This leaves me £35 M. gap.
My conditions must be (i) £30 M real savings or charges w’in the welfare field :
excludg. any juggling with £14 M. deficit on N.I. Fund.
(ii) on defence wd. ask wtr it wd. not be better to accept Ty. offer of £28 M. than
to announce £35 to come into operation on 1/7 (tho’ that wd. be a saving of £9
M). Division of £28 M. betwn. pay &amp; allowances to be discussed.
(iii) This is not the end of Civil Estimates examination. Free to look for addl.
savings.
D.S. We agree that announcemt. of increases to come into opn. later is not wise.
P.T. now asks for another £7 M. of real savings – not confined to pay?
P.M. P.T. wants another £7 M on defence. He suggests tht. it shd. come off pay &amp;
allowances. That he wd. prefer. He wd. accept £7 M. fr. other part of Def.
p’mme.
I.M. Was ready to accept £25-30 M. Therefore I must accept £30 M.
Tho’ there must be latitude one way or another – £1 M. over or under.
On (iii) I think this unreasonable if the £40 M. were found.
P.T. My (iii) wdn’t apply to welfare field.
P.M. Ques is wtr any new saving shd. go to the gap or go to reducing weight of cut in
welfare field.
D.W.S. I enter this at v. late stage. Disturbed at size of cut &amp; also to extent to wh. it is all
to fall on N.H.S. Haven’t bn. able to consider all its implications. But i) £30 M.
can’t be found w’in N.H.S. Total £700 M., of which £80 M. in stamp &amp; £40 in
charges. To add another £20 M. in charges you reach 20% – which was
Beveridge’s limit. Ought not to go beyond £20 M in full year.
Boarding charge is not administratively practicable.
My view is tht. £16 M. is maximum to be found from N.H.S. The other £14 M. cd.
come from N.I. Fund deficit.
B.C. Need time to reflect on repercussions on me of increased N.H.S. stamp. Why shd.
civil economies be sought so largely w’in social service field.
 
 
P.M. Effect on labour situation.
H.W. P.T. has got balance distorted. Confidence in £ depends more on avoiding wage
increases than on level of Estimates.
We are now on fringe of wage struggle. Scene now quiet. Mad to risk losing that
struggle for sake of few millions on Estimates.
This is why I prefer increasing N.H.S. stamp.
M. Agree with H.W. No virtue in any particular figure. Concerned v. much re effect
on wages struggle. Don’t therefore like increasg. N.H.S. stamp because of effect
on wage claims.
P.T. Must be able to say not spending more next year than this. I run enormous risks
by accepting what I have offered.
P.M. That is as far as we can go now. Suggest mtg. P.T., I.M., R.A.B., D.S. Sunday 5
p. m. On Monday Cab. can meet and decide.
