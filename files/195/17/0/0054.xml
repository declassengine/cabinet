  <content>C.C.77(58) 23rd October, 1958
1. Emergency Powers Bill. [Enter O.G., E.H.
2. Cyprus : Human Commission.
3. Steel : Location of New Works.
4. Economic Situation.
H.A. 3 priorities : sterling : internal price stability : employmt. On first 2 we have
made progress. Demand infln. squeezed out tho’ risk of cost infln. persists. Risk
of sliding back into infln. is less than 12 mos. ago. Therefore we can afford to
concentrate on emplt.
Assessment. Industrial Prodn. running down slowly &amp; likely to continue for 3
mos. No sign yet of up-turn. Consumer exp’re 4% higher than a year ago &amp; wage
increases continue. Forecasts of unemplt. in Jan/Feb. – no reason to reduce :
600.000 by Jan. Ind. cap. expre. above last year, but likely to drop next year.
Total priv. inv., now at record, may drop a little. Pub. investmt. : planning for rise
of £75 M. Exports are dropping – now 4% below last year &amp; likely to continue to
fall. But confidence is strong &amp; St. Exchange high.
Target : ensure that recovery after Xmas is larger}faster} than seasonal rate.
Avoid in investment, commitments wh. will increase inflationary pressure in ’60
and beyond.
Steps already taken. B. rate down : credit restns. relaxed : C.I.C. control relaxed :
h.p. restns. reduced : another £30 m. for short-term publ. cap. exp’re and ?750 addl.
new houses.
What more? a) Assce. to exports. Comm. assistance loans offered to Asian
Doms. will be linked to U.K. exports : and will open way to fresh orders. More
applns. can be considered.
Also : U.K. initiative in suggestg. to some Dom. &amp; Col. Govts &amp; some foreign
loans conditional on quick orders for exports – e.g. steel and heavy cap. goods.
And = easier terms fr. E.C.G.D. to help us to compete with G. and U.S. &amp;
b) Investment. Further redn. of B. rate. Publ. investment : total in
58/59 will be £35 M above Thorneycroft’s ceiling – tho’ not precisely by means
giving £30 M. For 1959/60 we can bring fwd. fr. followg. year, &amp; include some
new short-term work, and add another £50 M. [Addl. emplt. 50/70,000]. Total
for that year wd. then be £125 M : increase of 8 or 9% over last year.
c) Consumer expenditure. Already at record level &amp; some
industries mtg it are fully engaged : must not overload them, or prices will rise.
Prev. relaxn. of h.p. led to increased exp’re. The rest cars, T.V. etc.,) is becomg.
ineffective : control mght be lifted.
C.C.77(58) (cont) 23rd October, 1958
But cd. be done w’out much danger.
If more needed, some P.W. credits cd. be released. That mght be dangerous, as
plainly anti-slump measure. But quickly done &amp; non recurring. Legn. needed, to
discriminate.
 
 
P.M. Priv. investment?
H.A. Can’t stimulate w’out Budgetary measures. But unlikely to drop.
D.S. Govt. expenditure? Am I to reduce, while Ty. stimulates?
P.M. Must have clear mind – esp. in reln. to possibility of reducg. taxn. in Budget.
I.M. Unemplt. up by 38.000 to 514.000 or 2.3%. In all regions, esp. in Ldn, West &amp;
Scotland. In Jan., at peak, expect 2.9% or 625.000.
Of 38.000 as many as 35.000 odd are among perman. unemployed.
Sept/Oct. a bad period : 22.000 wd. be normal in this period.
Problem is to check this rise to peak.
M. H.A. has dealt with some of my anxieties. Don’t think we can do more than he
has in mind. But wd. like these measures to be introduced. I take more gloomy
view of outlook than he.
J.M. Concerned at drop in steel. Cd. N.C.B. help by restoring orders.
M. Am considerg. that with steel industry.
J.M. Hard to tell how much of this is due to de-stocking, wh. wd. be reversed by
renewal of confidence.
H.N. Ship-bldg. Owners are gloomy re freight market &amp; unlikely to increase orders.
Ditto for tankers.
Think therefore we shd. act on basis of a rather gloomy view.
H.B. Housing. Extra 750.000 was not to be spoken openly about. P.W.L. Bd. rate was
still 6% &amp; l.a.’s under instn. to p’pone unnecessary expenditure. Many l.a.’s are
still acting on that basis &amp; delaying starts. I wd. now like to send further &amp;
franker circular to l.a.’s. And if P.W.L. Bd. rate were also reduced things wd.
move quickly.
R.A.B. Approve measures a) to c). Leave aside for Budget any direct increase of
consumer expenditure.
But doubt if a) to c) will check trend.
