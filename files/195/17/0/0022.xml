  <content>C.C.31(58) 15th April, 1958
1. Summit Meeting. [Enter E.H., J. Simon.
S.Ll. Read text of proposed reply to latest Soviet note. W’ton 857. Para 5. Fr. and U.S.
insist on this para.
P.M. NATO. preferred our simpler draft. But original U.S. draft was much worse, even
than 857.
S.Ll. F.D. says para. 5 is essential if he is to hold opinion in Congress. Soviet note
clearly showed their attitude on Summit is v. difft. from U.S. and ours.
P.M. V. well : but suggest drafting changes designed to soften it a little.
S.Ll. If R. are ready to discuss substance, at dipl. mtg., we are in diffy. that there is no
agreed W. posn. on e.g. disarmament or disengagement. Outlined instns. given to
Reilly. Designed to give time by putting substance last in order of their
discussion.
2. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
Speakers in Budget debate. D.E. opens Wed. R.M. opens Thurs. J.S. &amp; H.A.
Mon.
3. Foreign Affairs.
S.Ll. a) Tunis. Fr. Govt. have accepted good offices plan. If they can carry this thro’
Parlt., we can move forward.
b) Cyprus. Turkish Ministers are going abroad for some time : a good reason for
delaying for a time. This, plus Gk. elections, will provide public reason for delay.
c) Kuwait. Must get a Br. airline here. They won’t have BOAC., but wd. make a
deal with B.E.A. Shdn’t risk foreign airline there merely because of technical
reasons.
H.W. BOAC will make loss of £2M. because subsidiaries run for political reasons : I
have told them to cut back on unprofitable ventures. But I will look at it again :
B.E.A. or a private operator.
P.M. * F.O. and M/T. to consider and report to me.*
4. Yemen. [Enter H.F., G.W.
P.M. Explained dilemma – guns now sited in or near villages. Are we to attack them?
Def. Cttee. recommend authy. be given – as in draft instructions to Commr. That
wd. be stepping up our activity in response to increasg. Y. activity.
 
 
Alternative approach – in view of U.N. provisions re self-defence shd. we register
complaint with U.N. reportg. incidents. We hesitated to do this previously
because thght tht. our Treaty posn. was too vulnerable. Now appears that it isn’t
quite so weak as we feared. Still a risk tht. we shd. stir up U.N. type of sniping
etc., v. our position.
S.Ll. Greatest danger is action involvg. large loss of civilian life. Wd. prefer not to
authorise counter-action v. guns in villages until we have decided wtr we shd.
take U.N. course. Our casualties only 1 killed &amp; 5 wounded – not v. high. (ALB.
More from raids etc.,) Why don’t we do some similar nuisance attacks vice
inhabited villages.
On U.N., if we report, they will want to intervene. Do we lose by that now that E.
&amp; R. are behind Yemen. Treaties with Yemen will stand up – risk is over
Treaties with Aden Protectorate.
A.L.B. Morale of levies is being shaken by gun-fire. Favour retaliation.
U.N. won’t help us because wd. prevent us from taking even present steps to
resist infiltration.
S.Ll. Govr. is doubtful re prospects of holding Protectorate.
A.L.B. Because people are doubting our will or capacity to govern. Failure to retaliate
will confirm that feeling.
K. Timing. Lodge complaint with U.N. Their obvious course wd. be to de-limit Y.’s
s. frontier. If thereafter attacks continued we wd. be in stronger posn. to act in
self-defence.
A.L.B. Delay.
K. But if U.N. delays it we can act in self-defence. But go to U.N. before we act.
G.W. Y. strength &amp; capacity in guns are growing. We may have to w’draw after some
time.
S.Ll. Can’t stop build-up : it’s from E. and R. sources. Aden is Nasser’s next target.
P.M. Then anticipate events by complaining now to U.N. – invite them to define &amp; if
nec. patrol this frontier. Must do that first. Having done so, wd. we be justified
in authorising counter-battery action as proposed in self-defence.
* F.O. to draw up, with C.O., report to U.N. &amp; consult Sec. Genl. on modalities.*
in consultn. with K.
No further authority to troops m’while.
[Exit G.W., H.F.
[Enter S., Alport.
5. Territorial Waters.
Tel. 173. Geneva.
S.Ll. Warships wd. have right of innocent passage w’in the 6 miles (message fr. Att.G.)
S. But innocent passage depends on consent of riparian States.
Hail. Right of access by sea to own country can’t be denied. This wd. cover
 
 
(x) access to Singapore &amp; Gib.
P.M. Confirm that (x) by enquiry of Att.Gen.
.. that right to pass w’ships thro’ strait to internatl. sea is not affected. And
does “innocent” mean only innocent qua riparian State concerned.
S.Ll. Not sure wtr breakdown wd. really be worse.
J.H. Dangerous qua fishing to support this U.S. plan. Safeguards aren’t strong and
may be whittled away.
Shd. be accused by fishing interests of breach of faith.
R.A.B. But alternative is Indian 12 miles, which is much worse.
P.M. U.S. are trying to help us over fishing. We were ready to go to 6 m. They have
secured that for us.
We shan’t do better than this on fishing.
Agreed : Resume discussion at 9. pm. [Exit S., Alport.
6. Industrial Disputes.
I.M. Buses. P.Q. to-morrow asking wtr there is any further process beyond arbitration.
Must say “none”. Strike 5/5.
Railways. T.U.’s seeing B.T.C. to-morrow : they are moderate : after mtgs
B.T.C. will see M/T. : they (T.U.’s) will then seek interview with P.M. At that
point only Govt. shd. publicly make their posn. clear. Prob. not until next week.
P.M. Our line can be i) expediting developmt. plans to increase earning capacity of
rlways. We must get that in before strike notices given.
ii) getting T.U.’s to co-operate in rationalisation of man-power
etc.,
7. Wilton Park.
S.Ll. Want to continue.
J.S. Can Ch.H.’s Cttee. look at priorities.
Ch.H. I support it.
P.M. In principle support it.
