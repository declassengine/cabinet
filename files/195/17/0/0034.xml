  <content>C.C.50(58) 26th June, 1958
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
Mon : Supply : cotton industry (incldg. H. Kong).
Hail. Wd. help if C.O. case were publicly deployed – with tact.
D.E. As our (U.K.) part in Imperial Preference.
P.M. to settle speakers to-day.
H. Killearn has tabled motion for 9/7 on Egyptian claims.
S.Ll. Seeing Salisb. on 3/7.
H. Try to get Balfour of Inchyre in line too – because that mght sink the motion.
2. Elections : Use of Cars.
R.A.B. Cars in Elections. Tories want to repeal s.88. Oppn. leaders, consulted, are
violently opposed : tho’ they enacted it w’out consultg. us. Can’t therefore
proceed with this in July. Propose to do it early next session.
I.M. Awkward to do it in Session likely to end in Genl. Election.
R.A.B. No time for another (controversial) Bill this summer.
D.S. Need we do it at all? Will be mis-represented.
3. Parliamentary Privilege.
R.A.B. Cttee. have agreed tht. no action be taken in this case. Tho’ original findings of
Cttee. won’t be altered. Rpt. may be rejected by H/C. Att.G. will invite them to
do so. And new members of the Cttee. (J.S. and Dugdale) may support him.
4. London Airport : Attendance of Ministers.
R.A.B. Reported Queen’s pleasure re seeing off at airport of members of R. Family.
Ministers to be excused from attendance.
Will circulate note on procedure.
5. Territorial Waters. [Enter S., Att.G.
Att.G. Our signing of the Convention wd. give us some help over Iceland. Particular
passages therein wd. support our case.
In the main legn. not needed – on uncontroversial Bill.
 
 
S.Ll. I agree.
J.H. Fishing industry wd. welcome our signing.
I.M. Wd. it prejudice future liberty re territorial sea.?
Att.G. No.
R.A.B. Need for reservation re continental shelf?
S.Ll. Will consider, later.
(paras 34-35 of Appendix.)
Agreed : sign convention &amp; optional protocol, subject to points
noted above.
Further Proceedings C.121.
Att.G. Oppn. from Soviet bloc &amp; others to further conference on territorial sea. We shd.,
however, continue to argue in favour of it. Only hope of uniformity is by further
conference. Tho’ recognise risks (para. 9).
Bailey has taken soundings in various capitals. His suggns. for regional
conferences on fishing have bn. well received.
We shd. aim at agreement on 6 + 6 with exceptn. for historic rights. We cd. not
argue for anything more restrictive. We mght also have to make concessions (by
way of greater definition) on historic rights.
S.Ll. If we cd. get U.N. to bless regional method of settling fishing, is another
Conference needed?
Att.G. Yes : for we shd. seek a chance of genl. agreemt. on limit – instead of letting
things drift thro’ unilateral action.
D.S. Is there reasonable chance of agreemt. on innocent passage for aircraft.
Att.G. Not rosy – for mil. aircraft. But problem will remain whatever agreemt. reached
on width of terr. sea. And you will be worse off if many countries go to 12 miles.
It must be to our advantage to get agreement on a reasonable limit e.g. 6.
R.A.B. We shd. agree our posn. with U.S. in advance.
D.S. Esp. on aircraft. Uncertainty may be better than clarifying position to our
disadvantage.
S.Ll. Ready to discuss with U.S. Not sure conference on limits would help us to get
fishing handled regionally.
J.H. Shd. consider further before we commit ourselves to dealing regionally with
fishing. Remember tht. sensible people on this subject are in Europe. Little
moderation in other Regions.
Hope we can get advice on this from Interdepl. Cttee. under F’maurice.
 
 
R.A.B. More inter-departmental thought is evidently needed. Better have a Cttee. of
Ministers concerned under Ld. Chancellor.
Att.G. Act quickly – because need of prepn. with U.S., Canada, India etc.,
S.Ll. Decns. needed in first half of July.
J.H. Shd. I m’while discourage fishing industry from sending unofficial repves. to sound
out p. opinion in Iceland.
Att.G. Yes : v. dangerous. May give impn. of weakness.
S.Ll. Mistake to go before 30/6 or even soon after Regns. introduced.
[Exit Att.G., S.
6. Aden.
A.L.B. Rulers are now taking initiative themselves twds. Fedn. – because pressure from
Yemen. Except Lahij all the important leaders in W. Protectorate favour this.
Cost. Will be necessary to spend money in Aden anyhow.
Possible tht., if we go fwd. with this, Lahij may adhere – thro’ decn. of Ruler or
pressure of his people.
Wd. still be possible to hold Aden itself as a fortress.
This is best way to m’tain our posn. in Aden &amp; Protectorate.
S.Ll. Strong support. May produce adverse re-action fr. Yemen – but no harm in that.
Will cost money : but shall have to spend here unless we mean to w’draw. Will
improve our posn.
H.A. Support in principle. Addl. cost is unwelcome. £3¼ M. at present. This will
involve addl. £1½ M. and a developmt p’mme with recurrent cost of £½ M. Thus
total increase of £2 M. Nowhere any off-setting economy.
Don’t want C.O. to indicate (para. 7) order of addl. expenditure. While we spend
more on security, we ought to hold back on social.
A.L.B. They open their mouths v. wide : and I want to indicate limits, esp. re Federal
Nat. Guard.
H.A. V. well : but soft pedal on social &amp; economic measures.
A.L.B. Will be careful to avoid commitment on money.
D.S. Support this course. Are defence and external relns. reserved to U.K.? Under
existg. Treaties?
A.L.B. In principle, yes. Shall have to make it specific in new agreements.
D.S. Can we rely on a defence agreemt. simultaneous with political.
H. Aim = make a stronger State. May be greater embarrassmt. to us in time than
separate weak ones. Surely we must take great care to safeguard defence &amp;
external relns. Favour this course – but with some doubts.
Memo. approved, subject to approval of P.M.
 
 
[Exit a.L.B.
7. World Youth Festivals.
Memo. approved.
8. Wages Policy : Arbitration.
I.M. No place in our system for compulsory arbitn.
Will need O-in-C. to revoke D.R.
Timing : p’pone announcemt. until after T.U.C. Conference : no need to mention
in Queen’s Speech : mght mention at Party Conference.
R.A.B. Cd. wait &amp; let it lapse with disappearance of Supplies &amp; Service Act, after
passage of econ. controls Bill.
H.A. Support M/L. proposal. Hope, however, we shall go on to review vol. arbitn.
machinery &amp; wages councils. My Cttee. cd. do so, before this is announced.
I.M. Can’t avoid debate in H/C. Favour therefore revocation.
Hail. a) Wd. ??? work to Ind. Court. b) Some Tory opinion favours compuls. arbitn.
I.M. On a) I believe Ct. is better than Tribunal. On b) I’m satisfied that majority
favour abolition of this D.R.
9. Industrial Disputes : Buses.
Labour posn. reported.
