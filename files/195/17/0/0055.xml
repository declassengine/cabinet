  <content>C.C.78(58) 24th October 1958
Economic Situation. [Enter E.H.
D.E. Assessment – broadly in accord with H.A.
Remedies – not sure we shd. insist too sharply on confining ourselves to measures
certain to provide quick unemplt. Wd. prefer to concentrate on productive
measures. Wd. class housing as non-productive &amp; on that account wd. prefer
education – and transport both of wh. wd. break new ground &amp; look less like a
mere reversal. Also a mistake to send circular to l.a.’s relaxing earlier restriction
– whistle blowing planning – more selectively by stealth, so far as possible.
One act on consumptn. : end. h.p. control (on cars, radio &amp; h’hold goods). Motor
industry wd. still insist on deposits.
H.A. Wd. increase h.p. debt by addl. £60-70 m. p.a.
D.E. Yes. But believe much of this wd. be borrowed anyhow. And h.p. abolition wd.
have good confidence effect – esp. if done during Motor Show.
Steel is key to weakness of economy. (i) Largely due to de-stocking. Major factor
in this is oil cos., who have bought nil for months. Suggest we move them to start
buying again. Wd. affect market, v. quickly. (ii). Overseas sales of steel. Loans
(ECGD credit) wdn’t bite quick enough. Better to go thro’ orders for cap. works
&amp; see wtr steel content cd. be expedited. E.g. piles for harbour schemes (C.O.).
Ditto for rlway equipment. Mills &amp; I will start this (Tues.) at steel-makers’ end.
Lorries and buses oversea demand can be stimulated. Turn enquiries into firm
orders.
We can also try loans under s.3 of E.C.G. Act.
H.B. Not makg. large claim for re-vitalising housing drive. Modest increase only
Circular : if H.A. wants l.a.’s to get on with short-term work, we can’t expect
them to do so w’out further guidance. Wish to issue a suitable circular, after
consultn. with H.A.
H.W. Heavy vehicles : and steel sections &amp; pipes. Unless hope of revival is seen there,
firms will begin to shed labour. Early action is essential.
G.Ll. Diff. to get balance just right. But more damaging if unemplt. rises too far.
Momentum may be lost – so there is an econ., as well as pol., risk. I therefore
favour rather more expansion.
Education. The flexible element is small works. Large undertakgs can’t
contribute w’out incurring longer-term commitments.
K. We know how much we suffer politically from rising prices. But we know too
how damaging a rise in unemplt. may be. – it wd. limit freedom to choose a date
for election.
Black-spots. We need an organisation (or a man) to vitalise Dpts. in reln. to
particular areas.
Can we ignore consumption? On Keynsian doctrine have we not reached the
moment for action on that also?
H.A. K. wd. never have put 2.5% as the proper point for stimulation of consumptn.
 
 
J.H. Action to win election in ’59 wd. serve us ill if it created inflation in ’61. Don’t
let us throw away results of past policy.
Is it not black spots we shd. concentrate upon?
Key need is to restore confidence in industry. In F.B.I. feeling better already than
3 mos. ago. Favour therefore action on lines suggd. by D.E.
D.S. Pol. issue. Apart fr. electoral considn., we shd. not rush this so much. 2 main
dangers : local patches of v. high unemplt. And foundation wh. they will give for
prophecy of worse to come.
Must therefore act to stimulate emplt. – with least danger of recurring infln.
Bldg. – slums, old people, new towns. Schools – avoiding long-term
commitments. Ty. cd. review Services bldg p’mmes – wd. help with recruiting.
cf. Service orders for textiles a few yrs. ago. Heavy vehicles – wd. wish to
accelerate Serv. p’mmes.
Must I go on causing unemplt. in def. industries – to get my exp’re down.
H. If we reached 3% in Feb. and returned to 2% by July, we shd. be about right.
Don’t panic – e.g. on swimming baths.
I’m more worried about longer-term. U.S. recovery may not be firmly based &amp;
producer countries will be poor buyers.
I prefer B/T. and M/T. measures to “public works”.
I.M. Don’t think it will go beyond 3.1%.
Measures proposed won’t arrest trend before end/year. And doubt if we shd. drop
below 500.000 at any time in 1958 save July/Aug.
*/ DATAC. 170 applns. : only 2 approved. their attitude has bn. v. strict.
Important to seize &amp; keep initiative over genl. problem.
H.A. Must remember prices. That was previously priority No. 1. politically. Mustn’t
imperil what we have achieved on that 1st. priority.
If we move too much, &amp; inflatn. recurs, we cdn’t check it quickly.
“Loss of momentum”. Remember we had too much, and it caused a b/p. crisis.
And that can develop v. quickly.
Unemplt. No particular figure wd. be fatal politically – trend is more important.
Tax reductions. Prospects aren’t good, as Estimates continue to rise. And roads
are above the line – as is defence. Can’t see tax reductions unless present
Estimates for latter can be reduced.
Further future – 1960. Prodn. &amp; consumptn. shd. by then be increasing again – but
not if world trade continued to decline.
Initiative. We must show we are takg. proper steps to counter trend, esp. in
investment.
P.M. Valuable discussion.
Diagnosis. Broad agreemt., with diffces. of emphasis. Ty. memo. fears inflatn. in
’60. Some of us (incldg me) fear this may be optimistic – and tht. we may be on a
down-turn in trade. H.A. is between it &amp; us. My hunch is tht. there is risk of
serious down-turn.
*/ Report on this from H.A. to P.M.
But none wd. go bancoon either view.
Remedies – consumption : investment (private &amp; publ.) : lending to our
customers.
 
 
Whatever measures we take must not appear to be a reversal of policy. but must
increase industry’s confidence in Govt. They can do so much more than we.
Consumption : measures act. v. quickly.
[Budget : must be careful of measures above the line. Cd. we re-cast division
above and below in next Budget? In this new situation.]
a) Propose we announce end of all h.p. restrictions –
(tho’ power shd. be retained). No ground, in present circs., for
interfering with contract betwn. consumer and producer. Wd. like
that announced pre-debate.
b) Purchase tax. £15 M. on [heavy] vehicles as a whole but only £5 M. heavy
lorries &amp; buses. Will Ty. consider removing the £5 M.
c) Post-war credits. Not above the line : but legn. needed for discriminy. action.
Consider wtr £15-18 M. cd. be restored.
* I wd. press a) and ask for b) to be considered favourably and c) considered.
Investment : Bank rate to be considered.
Investment allowances – can’t be done before spring – don’t want a Budget.
Avoid rigid formula for Dpts. Ask them what they can do, and select (Ty) those
wh. produce quick results.
We can spend more below line because savings are better.
Loans to Customers. Best but slowest.
Organisation. Whitehall must understand what Ministers want.
We need therefore (a) a clear statement of economic objective, to guide Dpts.
(b) plan of action – who is going to do what.
(c) progress reports on how we are going.
Black-spots – we thght earlier in terms of a Slattery. Let us consider that again.
Agreed : abolish h.p. restrictions at once : announce Mon.
review position in 2 weeks.
