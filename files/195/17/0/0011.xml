  <content>C.C.18(58) 25th February, 1958
1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter E.H.
a) Summit Meeting.
S.Ll. German For. Minister has bn. spkg. on disengagement lines.
U.S. more flexible on procedures.
P.M. Have sent message to Eis. – haven’t had his reply.
b) Tunisia.
S.Ll. Murphy has found Fr. v. inflexible. Sitn. deteriorating. Fr. ought to decide to reconquer
or w’draw : they are dithering.
P.M. We must be cautious in handling French.
c) Comets for Egypt.
S.Ll. We want markets for these. But earlier thght we shdn’t sell prestige goods to E.
until financial settlement reached.
P.M. Payment v. blocked sterling wd. reduce amount for claimants. Better look at this.
S.Ll. Believe it wd. be paid from earnings – No. 1. Sp. A/c.
P.M. If so, let it go ahead.
d) Middle East.
H. Wright’s suggn. of Developmt Corpn. Echoed by Hammerskold. Is this
opportunity for U.K. initiative – before Summit mtg.
S.Ll. Hard to get Iraq and Kuwait into this. Nuri much v. it : hadn’t enough money for
own developmt. Kuwait remits to U.K. – doesn’t want to get drawn into pol.
diffies.
D.E. Wd. involve transfer of money fr. our friends to our enemies.
S.Ll. Mght get Kuwait into econ. union with Iraq/Jordan – w’out pol. assocn. – with
approval of Saud. Will consider this further.
[Exit E.H.
2. Artificial Insemination.
R.A.B. Legal muddle. On social ques. Churches divided, save R.C. Don’t know what to
do : suggest Cttee. of enquiry.
K. Propose to say in H/L. that enquiry is needed to assemble more informn. esp. on
social side.
 
 
Legal issues are v. complicated. Apart fr. adultery, there is nullity and
illegitimacy.
Can’t propose legn. without further examination.
D.S. Is (b) necessary in t. of r.? Why imply readiness to prohibit.
Ch.H. Support that suggn. Practice w’in family has gone a long time. Prohibition or
reguln. will cause resentment.
M. Running into trouble?
K. Must at least legislate on some points.
P.M. Look at reports we have had, and can’t act upon, e.g. Wolfenden Rpt. Why bring
this fresh trouble on our heads?
Suppose the Cttee. recommend prohibn. or reguln. We cdn’t enforce it.
Cd. we not limit the enquiry to study of legal aspects only? Don’t get into ques of
morality. Report on that just before Election won’t be helpful. Anyway, what
prospect of agreed report?
R.A.B. x/ Restrict it to “legal consequences of existing practice.”
K. Shall still have to say we need an enquiry. Can say t. of r. need v. careful thought
– in light of views in debate.
Agreed : as at x/.
3. Roads Programme.
H.W. Firms have bn. consulted &amp; say the industry cd. manage all the projects un-starred
in my list, w’out damage to export industry.
These are all in my p’mme. Seek authy. to announce them in due course – save
tht. Severn [&amp; Forth ??] shd. not be announced before consultn. with M/Welsh
Affairs. and J.M.
H.A. This (industry’s capacity) is only one aspect. There is also burden on our
economy. Cab. said no announcemt. before cap. inv. p’mme reviewed in Apl.
H.W. trying to move too fast.
Costs of Forth, Severn &amp;d Blackwall. Ty. have no informn. on last.
* No objn. to announcemt. of Tyne.
P’pone announcemts. on Severn &amp; Blackwall pro. tem.
H.W. When Forth tenders are announced, we shall be under intolerable pressure re
Severn.
J.M. But that won’t happen until June.
Agreed : Tyne can be announced.
Take others in Apl. review of investment p’mme.
