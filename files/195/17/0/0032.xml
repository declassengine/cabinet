  <content>C.C.48(58) 17th June, 1958
1. Cyprus. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Preliminary consultns. held as planned.
At N.A. Council G. &amp; T. reactions were more reserved than seemed likely.
Others commended the plan. With result that at 7 p.m. they (Spaak) asked for 48
hrs’ p’ponement of statement to give chance to N.A. Powers to urge in Athens &amp;
Ankara tht. due considn. be given to the plan. Tho’ I have already told leaders of
Oppn. Parties of statement, this appeal can’t be disregarded. Much to be gained
by acceding to views of our Allies &amp; giving them chance they ask for. Will
therefore state in H/C. tht. statement will be p’poned for 24 hrs.
S.Ll. Doubt if N.A. Council are right to make this request. But, now it’s made, we
can’t reject it.
Agreed : interim statement in terms approved.
H. Proposed reply to Teviot’s ques on Makarios being invited to ecclesiastical
conference. Wd. sooner say : no power to exclude M : wtr he comes to
ecclesiastical conference is for A’bishop.
P.M. Don’t be rough about M. – he seems to be only one who favours our plan!
Say : B. subject : no power exclude him : decn. wtr to invite him to
this conference was ecclesiastical not political question &amp;
A’bishop was so informed. Agreed.
Hail: If he can’t be persuaded to p’pone his Ques.
2. Industrial Disputes.
I.M. Bus Strike. 42 voted in favour of return : 41 against : 1 tie. V. embarrassing for
Cousins. Assume tht. he will have to start negotiating. He cdn’t get it going
again 100%.
Smithfield – appointed Cttee. of investigation. Unusual because unofficial strike :
but this is root of whole docks situation. Employers favour it : so do T.U. leaders
in docks, not in S’field.
Docks. 7.000 are staying out (Tooley St.). Employers’ organisation is behaving
well, but one (Borthwick) outside it who won’t guarantee not to use unregistered
labour.
Dock pay claim. No particular merit. Last risk May ’52. Employers likely to
reject. Neither side wants arbitn. Strike likely in 6 wks. National claim.
Stoppage, if any, wd. be w’spread.
P.M. Emergencies Cttee. shd. consider what action cd. be taken in face of a national
dock-strike. Study to be made.
3. Economic Situation.
 
 
H.A. Exports : investment : consumption – this wd. be orderof re-flation. We are
beginning on the first : a little.
On investment – we are completing annual review and shall have to consider in
July wtr ceiling for next year shd. be raised. That’s public investment. In private
sector there are now signs of a falling off. We shd. begin to stimulate activity.
Some encouragemt. given in Budget. Shd. give more now. Therefore in Rpt.
Stage proposing to raise by another 5% the increases we had bn. proposing to
make on initial allowances. Wd. cost £18 M., but wd. get this back on income &amp;
profits tax in due course if it results in stimulating activity. If agreed, wd.
announce this afternoon.
M. Right course. But doubt if alone it will make much difference to investmt.
D.E. I do too. People holding back on doing so because of low sales not high taxes.
Other remedies wd. be more effective.
H.A. Agree – &amp; shall be considering these. But this, if it has to be done at all before
next year, must be done to-day.
4. Lebanon.
S.Ll. Situation is deteriorating.
Chehab is not taking resolute action : Govt. won’t sack him.
U.N. observers are unable to get about. H. is going there himself. H. is asking for
large nos. &amp; looks as tho’ he may be aiming at U.N.E.F.
Now, we cd. prob. not intervene w’out reference to Sec. Council – as their
observers are there.
P.M. Will call Cab. at once if critical situation develops.
Position has bn. changed by Sec. Council resoln. – but on the whole to our
advantage.
5. P.M.’s Visit to N. America.
P.M. Washington. Macmahon Act amendment is in the bag, and the bi-lateral will be
tabled in time to become effective before Congress rises. Its terms are satisf. –
tho’ limited to main mil. items. It will be supplemented by later agreemt. on
material.
Inter-dependence. As in brief. Pol : econ. : military.
France. Agreed they cd. not come in to our secret procedures for
Anglo.U.S. consultn. But we shd. hold tri-partite consultn. where France has
historical status.
Summit Meeting. As in brief. Plus account of White Housedinner. Hope
we can push them along. M/East. Supply of arms : points for us to
follow up. Arab Union Budget. General policy. Revealing discussion. State
Dpt. and many of F.D.’s advisers are tempted to think tht. N. shd. be conciliated
(Canadians feel the same). But F.D. is firm. We finally agreed tht. right policy is
to support our friends and take cool but correct attitude to N. Problem remains :
no figure we cd. support in M/E. to w’stand N.’s influence.
 
 
Suspensions of tests. U.S. posn. reserved until after Geneva mtg. But
agreed we shd. exact a price : prob. beginning of a system of inspection on
Soviet soil.
Economic Situation. As in brief. Nervous of their Bills : tho’ where they
expected only narrow majority of 20, they got 100. Didn’t deter me fr. public
speeches – wh. were well received. This may have heartened Adminn., who may
be behind p. opinion. Once Congress is up, we can press them. They ought to
come out with public statement before, rather than after, C.E.C. Montreal.
Agreed we must strengthen machinery for consultn.
Strategic Controls. As in brief.
Ottawa.
P.M. Asked many ques. On Lebanon &amp; M/E. their approach is v. theoretical.
Unrealistic faith in U.N. Need careful handling. But we can recall tht. Cons.
Party supported us over Suez.
C.E.C., Montreal. Passionately anxious for success – e.g. some new
Commonwealth institution for mobilisation of savings &amp; their direction to proper
uses. Universality shd. not be allowed to frustrate all progress. – so long as no
positive objection. They saw importance of Montreal being consistent with Delhi.
Europ. Free Trade Area – satisfied with assurances given.
Wool. – they are ashamed : may not do it.
No spectacular results. But kept contacts close.
E. &amp; F.D. both anxious to have behind some lasting link with us which will
persist after they have gone. For so much now depends on personal relations.
RAB. Thanks for account.
Valuable – &amp; outstanding mission.
Suggest P.M. shd. make speech to capitalise his statements in N. America.
H.A. Timing fr. my angle was just right. Got U.S. going in time.
