1. Commonwealth Tour. [Enter E.H,.
P.M. Gratitude to colleagues, esp. L.P.S., for holding fort during my absence.
Govt. did v. well in Parly. debates. Econ. debate : Bank rate enquiry.
Political situation now. Diff. period ahead – mainly psychological : as during
war, when things were going wrong. Both in foreign &amp; domestic affairs. Foreign
: 12 yrs. post war : compares with 1930 : generation resentg. not being in war &amp;
suffering sense of frustration : little prospect for the young – mounting armaments
etc., : religion not there to sustain them – not so much faith or courage as there
was. Hence clutching at straws : banning H. bomb., summit mtg etc., We must
not discourage these people. In F.A. debate shall try to strike discordant note of
unity in the country by speaking of these larger issues.
Domestic : I never supposed our economic measures wd. be other than unpopular.
We must persevere : win wage battle, keep things steady – and watch for moment
when some fruits of this policy can be brought forth – diff. timing.
Seek new note of confidence and buoyancy.
Must try to get more time to think. Punch-drunk with red boxes. More delegation
to Junior Ministers and to Cab. Cttees. We must get a second wind.
Sure it was right for me to make the tour. Helped to avoid damage to £.
Statistics of tour.
Began with Asia. In India Nehru set himself to make it a success. Public
demonstrations were striking – and unique. Leaders taking more balanced view
of past &amp; of Br. connection. Gt. hope of holding these people. 5 yr. plan must be
made to succeed.
Australasia. Old Doms. needed interpretn. of new : I attempted to do this : we can
get them interested in this new theme. Depth of loyalty : determination to stay
British (migration) – and B. capital for developmt.
Tory Party : party of Empire, puzzled about Commonwealth. Can we create new
mystique so that Tories can spk. with conviction of new Commonwealth.
R.A.B. Gt. appreciation of P.M.’s contn. to Comm. and to Govt. Diff. decn. – proved
correct by events. Success of tour reflected in U.K. Press.
Service to Comm. due from U.K.
H. Every report from Doms. stresses significance of visit. Conveyed to India our
sympathy with their long-term objectives. U.K. is responsible for liberal India
influencing Asia to-day.
D.E. More publicity for prepns. for Comm. Economic Conference.
P.M. Prs. mtgs. on this with selected journalists.
Foreign Affairs.
2. a) Tunisia.
S.Ll. Sitn. threatening, has bn. surmounted. Request for mtg. of S.C. won’t be
w’drawn, but discn. may be formal – ending in adjournment. On ‘good offices’
some diffcs. betw. us &amp; U.S. : they want to make affirmative proposals : we want
to get 2 sides talking together. Must try to keep Algeria out of these discussions.
 
 
b) Sudan.
S.Ll. E. are prob. right re frontier – tho’ wrong to use force. Sudanese are angry.
Better for us to avoid leading part in this.
No special oblign. on U.K. to help Sudan to resist aggression.
Hail. Attractive for us to be supporting an Arab nation v. aggression.
S.Ll. Wiser to wait for some other Arab State to help them first. We cd. then join in.
3. Ballistic Missiles.
D.S. Discussed with P.M., who asked Eis. to accept amendments desired by Cab.
Reply now in, accepting our suggestions.
Agreement due to be signed in W’ton. Shd. it follow F.A. debate? If so, we cd.
sign Thurs., Fri. or Mon. H/C. will expect statement &amp; W. Paper as soon as
agreement signed. Desirable fr. Govt. angle, too, since U.S. will publish at once.
S.Ll. Sign Fri. : statement promising W. Paper Mon.
I.M. Better wait until Monday.
Agreed : ask U.S. to sign on Monday in time for
statement at 3.30 p.m.
4. Cyprus.
S.Ll. Memo. describes my conversation at length. Believe there is a glimmer of hope.
T. may accept base &amp; internatl. safeguard for their minority. G. may accept on
basis of Island being unit and having chance of developmt. to self-govt. – also
with internatl. guarantees. As there is a glimmer, we must pursue it.
Recommend therefore p’poning original statement : initiate further talks with T.,
presumably in Ankara, on base &amp; timing. If their views on this are reasonable we
cd. make an offer, askg. them in return to abandon claim to partition.
At same time, we shd. consider implications of T. base and constitutional
developmt. in Island.
D.S. Anxious for settlement because of continuing heavy mil. commitment. If T.
police were not giving loyal support, we shd. have to re-inforce.
But worried – as are C.O.S. – at consequences of having T. base while we are still
responsible for law &amp; order in C. Legalised inlet for arms smuggling to T. in
Island. Worse still if G. base. Unless confident tht. T. and G. accept posn. as final
and will not abuse facilities.
P.M. Physical establmt. of base shd. not occur until stage when our respons. for security
is about to end.
S.Ll. T. wdn’t accept if date for establmt. were unduly p’poned. We cd. however make
condns. re base. Cd. prs. be demilitarised until we go.
There will have to be Treaty – 3 Power or with U.S. as guarantor – before T. base
is created. That wd. be some safeguard.
 
 
Hail. If it turned sour, we cdn’t m’tain law &amp; order : shd. have to retire to our base.
R.A.B. Alternatives : reassert our supremacy &amp; rule, coute que coute.
or give T. a base. This means a constitutional plan to begin at
once : 7 year gap is impracticable now.
P.M. Agree : we must now go for a settlement, as a deal. We can’t any longer plan for
a developing situation over 7 yr. period.
H.A. What about tri-dominium now?
A.L.B. Favour that. Not, however, inconsistent with facilities for T. base hereafter.
S.Ll. Indications in G. and T. are that settlement may be reached if it’s done quickly.
Need also for us (qua home opinion &amp; foreign) to announce a policy soon.
P.M. D.S.’s fear is understandable. But do T. really want to seize whole island by
infiltration by a base? Believe all they want is to prevent island being used by
others v. them.
D.S. Cd. we not work constitution on promise tht., if it went twds. Enosis, T. wd. be
given a base.
A.L.B. T. wdn’t support that. Hypothetical – and possibility of Labour Govt. in U.K.
P.M. On S.Ll.’s plan, you might get a settlement – wh. world wd. welcome. Wtr
parties cheated on it thereafter, no one can say.
But if T. fear is genuine, grant of base wd. enable them to relinquish other
interests in Island i.e. partition.
Agreed : S.Ll. to pursue negotiations with T. on basis proposed.
Paras. 4 and 5 of memo. approved, for study.
[Enter Att. G., P., A.N., Selk.
5. Territorial Waters.
Note not taken.
