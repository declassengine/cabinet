1. Industrial Disputes. [Enter E.H.
I.M. } Reported results of discussions yesterday at M/L. with repves. of both sides in Ldn.
H.W. } bus dispute.
Elliot wants to meet T.U. now – w’out first coming to M/T. He evidently wd. like
to settle : tho’ previously he was for standing firm.
M. Can’t now go for settlement outside award of Ind. Court. Generally agreed.
H.W. He will say that in the end we shall have to settle – by compromise of some sort.
But I must say this is not the moment.
P.M. Conditions must eventually be determined by Govt.
x| E.g. cost must not be more than £1 M. : some differential must be preserved :
| [Green Line crews mght prs. be put on same basis as Red, or given some
| improvement.] {?Review mght be brght fwd?}
I.M. [ ] is only area in which we cd. suggest compromise at this stage.
If we make no move at all now, strike will probably extend – e.g. to docks,
E.T.U. in underground etc.,
P.M. Let J.E. see Cousins. Tell him he must not seek settlement outside award. But he
cd. tentatively suggest some improvement for Green Line.
H.A. He shd. surely say tht. strike has made it even more diff. to find the original £1 M.
H.W. Yes : we shdn’t even discuss possible compromise now.
Agreed : J.E. to be instructed on lines of x/. less { }
2. Bank Rate.
H.A. Bank rate is being reduced to-day to 5½%. Redn. of half a point.
3. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for week after H/. resumes at end of recess.
10/6. Debate on disarmament.
S.Ll. to consider wthr. W. Paper shd. be publd. giving W. proposals – they are not
prominently in public mind.
4. Territorial Waters. [Enter Selk., Att.G.
Draft of public declaration. Omit para. 2. Agreed.
Hail. Open 2nd. para. This is unilateral decln. wh. cannot alter intern. law. Agreed.
 
 
S.Ll. Para. 3 last sentence : re-draft to make it more apparent tht. we shan’t use force
unless I. do so first.
J.M. Delete references to “compromise” in para. 6. Agreed.
Instructions to R.N.
Agreed no live shot across the bows.
Selk. Is it right to require H.M. ship to w’draw if live shot fired by I.
P.M. Yes. Strengthens our case before U.N. Risk of controversy over who fired first
shot.
D.S. Don’t fire on first occasion. But, if they do fire, protest to I. and to U.N. and then
give full protection with right to retaliate.
Selk. Para. 10. Give 3 warnings &amp; then fire to neutralise I. guns, not to sink other ship.
Agreed : Substitute Selk. formula, as para. 8 : del. 10.
Timing.
J.H. Make our decln. as soon as poss. after I. declaration. Agreed.
Let me then see fishing industry as soon as poss. thereafter. (i.e. after I.
declaration). Agreed.
[Exit Selk., Att.G.
5. European Free Trade Area. [Enter E. Marples.
P.M. Faure &amp; Marjolin have said Fr. situation is such tht. France can’t go further with
F.T. Area – and may even have to break out of Common Market, if de Gaulle
comes into power.
Therefore no need to consider these pp. to-day. Agreed.
6. Postage Stamps.
E.M. As in memo. I am against it.
J.M. Gt. majority of Scotsmen don’t want it.
But Boy Scout stamp is awkward precedent because B. Powell’s centenary as
well as 50th. year of Scouts.
Will overprint be conceded?
E.M. Yes : if someone pays for it.
J.M. Must not be paid for by Sc. Nationalist movement.
