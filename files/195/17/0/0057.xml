  <content>C.C.82(58) 25th November, 1958
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.
RAB. Business for next week.
2. Ghana.
P.M. No P.Q.’s yet on Order Paper.
H. But some are likely : prs. wise to volunteer a statement. Clear that Nkrumah has
not considered any implications.
P.M. Less discussion on answer to P.Q. Let us get a friend to table one. For answer
Thursday.
3. Parliamentary Procedure.
R.A.B. Ch. Whip and I will give evce. Only major chance of devolution is to allow
Finance Bill to be considered in Standing Cttee. Shall ask Cttee. to consider this on
merits.
[Exit H. Millar.
4. Integration of N.A.T.O. Air Defence.
D.S. Our national position is safeguarded by fact that U.K. will be a geographical area
&amp; we shall therefore retain separate command under SACEUR.
Also I propose to make in advance reservations in 9(a).
P.M. Concerned at para. 2(a) of Annex. Remember French request for fighter
squadrons in 1940.
H.A. i) Para 2(b). “Air defence” is wider than defence of deterrent.
ii) What of role of fighters in U.K. in support of squadrons overseas.
iii) Must reserve in our own hands size &amp; even existence of F. Force.
D.S. Para (j) meets (ii). Para (f) meets (iii).
I wd. have wished to amend para 2(a) but N.A.T.O. document and difficult to
touch it.
P.M. We have assigned ground forces and T.A.F. But assigning our home defence is a
different matter.
D.S. Saceur wants to re-organise on Continent in peace-time to build up an effective
integrated defence system.
P.M. Will recall the great controversy of 1940.
D.S. Let us confine 2(a) to war, and add a para. indicating that joint planning for that
purpose will be undertaken in peace.
 
 
Agreed : proceed as at x/.
[Exit H.Millar, D.S.

5. Social Investment : Education.
G.Ll. Want early publn. Hope colleagues will agree.
J.M. Want to mention a) indefinite deferment of trained teachers, tho’ this is not
mentioned in English Wh. Paper.
b) want to put forward new version of para. 21, which I
will discuss with M/Edn.
H.A. Para. 23 – a sentence was to be deleted.
J.M. I wish to do so.
I.M. Paras 13-21 (esp. end/15) of Engl. W.P. is best defence of Labour policy I have
[esp. 15-18] yet seen. Also 16 : M’sex policy. 17 : hope we wd. never favour abolition of old
grammar school.
If this is right policy, it means that Socialists are right.
Leave out paras 13-21 altogether : and make the memo. factual.
H.W. I agree – entirely.
P.M. Needs revision to avoid sentences which, taken out of context, cd. be
misrepresented.
Agreed : R.A.B. and I.M. to assist in revision of these paras.
R.A.B. Wd. also like to stress principles of 1944 Act, wh. are misrepresented by Labour
policy statement.
D.E. Para. 23. I regret this change. Original circular on minor works in 1957 – gt.
success was freeing l.e.a. from havg. to seek sanction of M/Ed. – stiffened their
sense of responsibility.
H.A. Ty. have raised ceiling. But then must be an over-all limit.
P.M. Good – clear – papers. Shd. make an impact – as moderate, empirical and
common-sense. Hope, however, it will be properly put across to Press &amp;
therefore boosted by Party organisation.
But i) Point made by J.M. at a) above applies to England too. Shd.
therefore be mentioned in English W. Paper too. Agreed.
ii) Para.32 “further help for churches”. Involves legn.
What will you say?
G.Ll. Intend to enter into negotns. with the churches.
6. Horticultural Tariffs.
J.H. Five applns. made. I supported two. All have bn. rejected – by E.P.C. An
announcement of this will affront industry. Are Cab. willing to approve my two
 
 
increases – tomatoes &amp; cut flowers. If not, other steps will have to be taken : &amp;
we ought to say so. But it wd. involve new Exchequer money : and it wd. be new
ground, and open to incalculable pressures. Tariffs may well be cheaper.
D.E. Can’t be proved that reduction in earnings is due to imports. It is due to
inefficiency and to increased costs (e.g. anthracite).
H.A. We have accepted principle of support for hort. as for agric. – and have said tht.
our method will be tariffs – applns. being considered on merits. On econ. grds. we
have had to reject all these 5 applns. Increase in costs doesn’t justify increase of
tariffs – unless increase has bn. relatively larger than that of importers.
Another form of support. Must consider, but shd. avoid commitment. Cd. do
somethg. on potash subsidy. But anything wh. wd. support extension of glasshouse
industry wd. be v. dangerous – stimulatg. uneconomic new prodn. We must
have study of the industry before committing ourselves to further help. Some
sections are doing v. well.
R.A.B. I can’t defend E.P.C. decisions. Pledges were specific.
