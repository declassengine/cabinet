  <content>C.C.86(58) 18th December, 1958
1. Cyprus. [Enter E.H., A.N., &amp; Newt.
P.M. Message from S.Ll. – both Gk. &amp; T. Foreign Ministers urging reprieve of 2 men
under sentence of death. Promise that they might to-day produce agreed proposal
for settlement.
This was communicated to Govr. In light of it we decided to commute.
A.L.B. Have no doubt this was right.
But Govr. now wishes to announce that he took his decision in hope of renewed
negotns. with T. and G.
P.M. Can he not state officially only that he has commuted. And reasons, as
background.
Att.G. Any precedent for giving reasons?
A.L.B. No.
H.A. V. dangerous precedent.
R.A.B. Deprecate interference with justice for pol. reasons. I cdn’t agree. But not clear
wtr I need to agree.
P.M. It is not.
R.A.B. Therefore I strongly deprecate any explanation of reasons.
Agreed : Govr. to be instructed not to give any reasons.
2. International Whaling Convention.
J.M. A no. of international agreemts need to be made before Convention becomes
effective – on 1st. June. Japan coming in : ratification : agreemt on sharing 80%
of the catch. Br. industry want to give notice of w’drawal now in case this shd.
come off : if it doesn’t, we cd. come in again. We wd. make it clear tht., if Ldn.
agreement were concluded, we shd. stand in again.
Att.G. No gt. harm in keeping foot in door.
Diffy. = effect on Iceland dispute &amp; Law of Sea : para. 12.
J.H. I sympathise. Too hard to get across our reasons for notification. We took
initiative in getting Ldn. Agreemt. – hard now to back-pedal so soon. Unemplt.
risk to only 200 men.
Likely that Norway will w’draw. Then it will be easier for us.
HA. In view of example we have set in these matters, it wd. be unwise for us to take
initiative in w’drawing.
K. We cd. assure industry tht., if Agreement did not come off, we wd. w’draw from
Convention a year later.
 
 
Agreed : no notification this year of w’drawal – unless Norway w’draws.
3. Iceland Fisheries Dispute.
P.M. At suggn. of Norway we have suggested to Iceland that, pending a conference, we
cd. agree tht. we wd. not fish w’in 6 mile limit if they wd. not molest us between
6 and 12 miles.
Noted.
4. European Free Trade Area.
H.A. Paris discussions – in O.E.E.C.
Genl. support for continuing negotns. for a free trade area.
On modus vivendi – initial disagreement and row. Fr. protest re negotiations
under threat. V. gradually all, in sequence, expressed regret at Fr. attitude. Fr.
ultimately admitted tht. for them, discrimination was essence of Rome Treaty.
Best we cd. do was to adjourn until 15/1. Study m’while of consequences of
action of Six and of Br. proposal. We undertook to take no positive action before
mtg on 15/1.
V. unhappy. But a necessary stage was to bring it out that French are isolated..
D.E. We have seized initiative. Much sympathy with our view. We must get out
precise statement showing what our proposals mean. We can’t have many
exceptions : must open as many of our quotas as we can. Net effect to our trade
will be good.
R.M. Final mtg. with non-Six. They are solid with us. They will seek to influence U.S.
opinion.
Documents now de-restricted. Am therefore working on Wh. Paper.
Growing feeling among Six tht. some discriminn. v. rest of Europe is essential to
their system. Feel we ought to challenge that – in a note to Six Powers.
H.A. Shd. like to consider that. For next move will be crucial.
5. Sterling : Convertibility.
H.A. My discussions with French after 1st. day. Increasing internatl. pressure to go
convertible – unifying 2 rates – esp. from IMF. and Germany. B/E. favour this. I
was about to recommend it when Europ. diffies. came to a head : we thght French
wd. resent it. But last week we learned (thro’ Bank of France) tht. French were
about to make similar move &amp; wd. wish to follow us. Erhard in Paris told me
this, adding tht. Fr. were also going to de-value &amp; wd. get a loan from G. I told
him we had reached no decn. on timing. Pinay told me Fr. wd. welcome action by
us &amp; wd. follow it. I suggested to F. &amp; G. Ministers tht. we shd. be in this act
together. Pinay said this practical co-opn. wd. help twds. resolving F.t.a. problem.
He suggd. action between 25 and 31/12. I proposed mtg. between Govrs. of 3
Banks. If these technical discns. go well, I propose to act at turn of year. Shd.
have to consult Commwealth on 22/23 Dec. Shall then be under increasg.
 
 
pressure to remove dollar discrimination : but we need not on that go faster than
our circs. warrant.
Important issue – what happens to E.P.U. Does it at once, or later, become an
Europ. Monetary Assocn.
R.A.B. Importance of publicity.
D.E. Significant tht. French is slipping into hands of G. moneylenders. Will diminish
Fr. capacity to call the tune among the Six.
Cartel agreemts. betwn. F. &amp; G. industrialists. This is why Fr. is willing to open
quotas to G.
Means that G. will soon get financial &amp; industrial control over F.
Hail. Eventually G., not F., will be clue to European situation.
D.E. Believe C. Market is not big enough for G. They will break out of it.
R.M. As soon as Adenauer’s influence goes.
R.A.B. This will be major step in history of our currency. Recall 1952. Support H.A. in
this.
Need for special secrecy.
6. Malta.
A.L.B. Conference shd. end on Monday. Olivier friendly. Mintoff is asking to see me.
Haven’t yet used latitude given re formula.
7. Cotton Imports.
P.M. ALB and I agree this shd. be brght to a concln. Have a draft tel. to H. Kong.
Lancs. can make no further concession. Ques outstanding : flat or escalated rate :
towelling. Amount involved is v. little. Fair soln. wd. be either flat rate of 115 m.
for each of 3 years plus 3 for towelling and carry-over. Or 110, 112½, 115 – if H.
Kong prefer it, with no carry-over. Ask them to choose. If H.K. industry can be
persuaded to choose either, we wd. press Lancs. to accept : if they wd. not, free
import. wd follow. Advantages of vol. agreemt. wd. be explained. Then, if H.K.
won’t choose either, “pressure for quota will become irresistible” : hope H.K.
will therefore come to a vol. agreemt. by end/year. Make it clear tht. neither this
nor any Govt. will be able to avoid imposing a quota if a vol. agreemt. is not
reached.
Have seen Rochdale. Believe he can get Lancs. to accept either.
