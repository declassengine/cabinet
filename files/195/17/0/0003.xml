  <content>C.C.84(57). 12th December, 1957.
[Enter E.H.
1. Parliament.
Business for next week. Resumption 21/1. F.A. debate Thursday.
2. Import Duties Bill.
D.E. Propose to drop the clause providing for reviewing Cttee. vice I.D.A.C. There is
insufficient support for it. It was included mainly because we thght we shdn’t get
away with status quo.
Agreed.
3. Ballistic Rocket Sites in U.K.
D.S. Private Notice Ques. Can I disclose that there will be one U.S. site in U.K. in
addn. to those operated by us with U.S. weapons. Has always bn. an element in
agreement but has not h’to bn. made public.
4. United States and Canadian Loans.
P.T. Propose to take a bisque this year. Because of other debt payments this year.
Bisque enables us to fund this part of it over 45 yrs.
P.M. Justificn. : unusual drawings of reserves for special reasons at this time e.g.
India’s 5 year plan – not part of ordinary risks or movements of a banking system.
Approved.
5. B. P. Company : Plan to Close Refinery at Haifa.
P.M. We don’t interfere with commercial managemt. of Co. But as major share-holder
we can’t pretend publicly we knew nothing of the project. Better that they shd.
ask if we had any considns. we want them to keep in mind – and they shd. then
take decisions, which wd. be their own.
This kind of drill shd. be regularised, and followed on this occasion.
M. B. P., tho’ they manage it, don’t own it.
[Enter J.H.
6. Libya.
Para 16.
S.Ll. i) U.S. hanging back on earlier plan for tri-partite discussion of financial
need &amp; aid. In bi-lateral talks L. wd. play off one v. another.
ii) L. have agreed to our staying on, barracks etc.,
 
 
iii) Some troops will have to stay beyond March ’59.
iv) Br. mil. mission shd. stay longer – will help to ease U.S. in.
P.T. We have opening to reduce, in spring ’58, our commitment to support L. budget.
Wd. sooner p’pone firm decisions until Estimates generally screened.
Proposal in para. 3 wd. put F.O. Vote above this year’s.
Need appraisal of L.’s value to us.
If W.O. can keep 2 battns. in L. w’out extra on Def. Budget, no comment.
D.S. We can’t throw away value of all we have put in for sake of 2 battns. Shall see
how we can accommodate this w’in W.O. defence total.
Subsidy to Budget, while U.S. finance investment, is bad business.
S.Ll. U.S. can’t do first : we get a share of second.
H.W. Valuable c. aviation facilities in L.
J.H. Can keep 2 battns. until March ’59 w’out diffy.
Br. mil. mission. Best to justify that by U.S. off-shore purchase of Br. equipment
etc., for L. Army.
S.Ll. Containment plus in M/E. will mean a little more money. We saved £10 M. on
Jordan subsidy. We shall have to use some of that.
H. Remember we said in W. Paper we cdn’t find money for development.
P.M. Only Pakistan – who wdn’t object to loans to Arabs.
[Exit J.H.
7. N. A. Council Meeting.
P.M. Will inform Cab. of prelim. discns. with U.S. at week-end.
i) Must get U.S. to understand that their defence (missile) must be
establd. in Europe until they have long-range weapons.
ii) Is it our interest to disengage – new form of appeasement. Or to tie
Germany tightly in – thro’ N.A.T.O.
8. Yemen.
A.L.B. Reported action taken on Def. Cttee. conclusion.
[Exit S.Ll.
9. Road Programme : Severn Bridge.
H.B. Important gap in communications.
“Scots got Forth Bridge because they have a S of S.”
Intolerable if M/T. now announces Tyne tunnel starting in 1960.
But I rely mainly on merits. If M/T. takes same view, and can find room for it in
p’mme, wrong that he shd. be precluded on financial grounds by Ty.
P.T. Apart from merits, no ques it wd. be unwise to announce now decisions to start
this in ’61.
 
 
No abatement of financial pressure : highest jump in Estimate ever known in
peace. My duty now is to cut them back. Some v. painful (ch. allowances) others
v. drastic (atomic energy). How in that context, can we contemplate announcemt.
about a bridge in ’61.
I was generous over road p’mme on basis that spectacular announcements cd. be
avoided.
If this went ahead, peak of Forth &amp; Severn Bridge wd. come too close. We are
already near a monopoly posn. – can’t get competitive tenders for Forth Bridge.
x/ Time to consider wtr. we do start this in’61 is when we consider capital p’mme
for that period.
H.W. Promised to avoid issuing lists of projects over period of years.
This Bridge is a live political issue. I have stuck to principle of recovering cost
by tolls – a disinflationary method.
Suggn. : series of large capital works on bridges &amp; tunnels. Wd. it help to say
y| that these must be phased according to engineering resources available – separate
from roads generally – consider relation to their overseas work.
Another 12 months of planning, anyhow, for constructn. of Severn Bridge.
P.M. Right time for announcement is x/.
Work out phasing as proposed at y/. M/T. to arrange.
M’while M/T. to avoid committing his money, in p’mme, in such a way that it
can’t go fwd.
Agreed : as proposed by P.M.
[Enter Att.G.
10. Malta.
R.A.B. Status of Malta.
(1) Greatest c.m. of agreemt. wd. be to adopt 1st. 2 paras of 2nd. alternative.
First affirmation. “for ever after” wd. involve an inconsistency – and wd.
need to be defended as sentiment.
Att. Genl wd. prefer to insert these words in sub-section (1) and delete
sub-section (2).
(2) Second affirmation. Propose that it shd. be confined to repn. as such and
tht. numbers shd. be dealt with by Act of U.K. Parlt.
(3) First version is infinitely preferable to the second.
I recommend as at 1. 2. and 3.
A.L.B. I accept (1) and will try to get Malta to accept it.
On (2), I wd. sooner give up “for ever after”, than sub-section (2).
On (3), the second version wd. be more acceptable in Malta, but I wd. bow to my
colleagues’ views.
P.M. Sub-section (2) doesn’t bind another Parlt.
Att.G. But objectionable because appears to be doing so.
My alternative follows precedent of union with Scotland &amp; Ireland.
And gives in substance all you can give.
P.M. But (2), tho’ not binding, has some moral influence on succeeding Parlts.
K. But 1(2) follows N. Ireland precedent.
 
 
P.M. If you don’t have written constitution, these assurances (tho’ not strictly binding)
are pardonable – because all we can do. It doesn’t bind further Parlts., but it
guides them.
Att.G. On point (2) I wd. prefer that principle be recognised in preamble.
A.L.B. Accept plan for reserving numbers for ordinary legn. on seats etc.,
But do want principle of repn. in body of the Bill.
P.M. Accept Version I of second affirmation – agreed.
P.M. No strategic reason for retaining dockyard – Def Cttee. decision. Cdn’t announce
closure, after introducing Bill. Must know where we stand on this before we
settle timing of Bill.
Att.G. Repeated suggn. tht. principle of repn. shd. go into preamble and shd. not require
consent of Parlt. of Malta.
K. Hope Att.G. won’t insist on this point.
E.H. Every indication that Tory opinion in H/C. has hardened v. integration. J.S., for
example , and W.S.C. are adamant v. it.
Presentn. will need v. careful handling.
R.A.B. V. awkward. May get Bill by Labour votes.
