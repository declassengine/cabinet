  <content>C.C.44(58) 21st May, 1958
1. Industrial Disputes. [Enter E.H.
I.M. Thght I shd. appear to be takg. some interest before we dispersed for Whitsun.
Neden is therefore seeing both sides.
No link betwn. rlway settlement &amp; this.
No sign of any move by T.U. May be a v. long strike.
R.A.B. Prepared for extension e.g. to power stations via E.T.U.
P.M. Rlways. Economies shd. be seen, soon &amp; noticeably.
H.W. Announcg. to-day tht. no of trains will be w’drawn after Whitsun. Also 20 applns.
to close branch lines.
2. Foreign Affairs.
a) Lebanon.
S.Ll. More of country under Govt. control. Pol. soln. more likely – on basis of
Chamoun yielding Presidency to Chebab. Decision is for him to take.
State of readiness of our forces shd. be m’tained, m’while.
P.M. Cd. we not reduce nos. of B. forces to be flown in, as 6th. Fleet is nearer. M/D. to
consider this. On basis of hardship to troops not that we think situation is easier.
b) France.
S.Ll. Jebb thinks considerable chance of de G. coming into power constitutionally w’in
next few months. Suggests rapprochement betwn. de G. &amp; Mollet – I think tht.
unlikely. But risk remains of violent coup d’état by military, who cd. take Paris –
as all best Fr. troops are in N. Africa.
P.M. We shd. avoid any pronouncement on N. African affairs. Also any advice to
French. Jebb shd. be restrained.
c) Muscat &amp; Oman.
S.Ll. Sultan is coming here. Inter-depl. cttee. to review what we can give. We must
tackle him on Gwadur &amp; Buraimi.
On B. wd. wish to sound him on basis of some condominium in return for Saudi
recognition of his frontiers.
[Enter Selk., Att.Genl.
3. Territorial Waters.
S.Ll. Discussion in N.A.T.O. y’day. Iceland’s proposal was met with hostility from all
save Iceland. Spaak has appealed to I. Govt. But likely tht. they will announce
unilateral decision on Friday. And we shall have to make our posn. clear. Not
 
 
satisfied with 1st. draft. Only ques for Cab. is wtr we shd. make plain now our
intentn. to protect our trawlers.
Att.G. Favour its inclusion. Shan’t get progress until we show firmness. Also if we are
to protect, we shd. announce our intention to do it in advance.
S.Ll. Our friends don’t like our standing so firm &amp; we shall be blamed if effect is to
cause I. to leave N.A.T.O.
P.M. Iceland Tel. 263. We must watch that position.
Att.G. Make our decln. fairly soon after I. announcemt., if latter has authy. of I. Govt.
Important to make our posn. clear – also to protect successfully on first practicable
occasion.
Agreed : terms of statement to be drawn up by F.O. &amp; Att.G., and
circulated to Cabinet : action on it to be approved by P.M.
J.H. Wish to see leaders of our industry at end/week &amp; get their co-opn. Wd. prefer to
tell them privately not to ban I. landings rather than include it in statement.
Agreed : Omit from statement. Defer talks with industry until we
know what I. Govt. do.
H. This action will bring U.S. as well as Canada on to I.’s side.
Agreed : Cab. to see revised draft on Thurs.
J.H. not to see industry until I. Govt. statement made.
Att.G. Instructions to R.N.
Attention to (e) Excludes firing on B. trawler with Br. crew on bd.
(f) But warning may be given that shot may be fired v. towing I.
ship. Linked with (g), wh. makes use of (f) less likely.
Selk. If H.M. ship is there at time of arrest, we can handle this.
Don’t think (f) second sentence is necessary.
P.M. Must have a clear line on this.
Agreed : no firing first : therefore delete second sentence of (f) and
first phrase of (h).
Para(h) ? If I. opens fire, we can retaliate shot for shot, without intent to sink.
Att.G. Risk of dispute as to who shot first. Prefer therefore not to return fire on first
incident. Break off &amp; make protest or reference to U.N.
P.M. Para 3. last sentence – in terms of firearms or explosives not weapons.
Agreed : revised draft to be submitted to Cab. Thursday.
[Exit Selk. &amp; Att.G.
4. L.G. Reform : Education [Enter D.W-S.
 
 
G.Ll. I started this hare but admit that is dead.
5. Government Expenditure.
H.A. A warning note. Revenue increase will slow down &amp; won’t absorb this sort of
expenditure.
H. Staff ceilings – can’t keep w’in rigid rules.
H.A. Compensations elsewhere – esp. C.O.
A.L.B. But I need more.
H.A. Stand firmer v. supplementaries. Reject new exp’re. because not included in
Estimates.
P.M. Call for restraint in expenditure – generally.
R.A.B. Need for more prisons. 5.000 sleeping 3 in a cell. 40% increase in Borstal and
young prs. in 18 months. This wd. be an addl. item for your para. 8. Proposals
submitted to Cabinet.
S.Ll. Military assistance to f. countries. We are charged (by Service Dpts) a very high
rate – e.g. for training officers. Agreed : Ty. to examine this.
[Exit E.H.
6. Steel : Location of Strip Mill.
P.M. Opinions sharply divided. Can’t be reconciled.
Doubts about need for immediate decision.
P’pone until after Whitsun.
M’while let us reflect –
a) Shd. national considns. in our U.K. over-ride economic considns.
Disproportionate burden of unemplt. borne by Scotland.
Equally strong Welsh opinion.
b) You wd. never give industrial cert. to I.C.I. to put such a plant at Newport
viz. D/Industry argument.
c) Plant can only be built by Govt. loan – to a nationalised co. R.T. &amp; B. or
to private firm who wd. carry little of cost on equity.
Much turns on management; R.T. &amp; B. and S.C.O.W. have the knowhow.
But Sc. firms now seem readier for a consortium to run it in Scotl.
What relative priority are we to give to these groups of considerations:
Is it possible tht. right course will be to p’pone erection altogether.
M. Also bear in mind cost of product.
At present steel capacity is under-employed. Legit. excuse for delay. Steel trade
disposed to think plant wdn’t be needed until ’67. We mght be able to make
statement justifying p’ponement.
Report of Steel Bd. has bn. held up pending our decision. Read passage fr. draft
favouring Newport location. Shd. I get them to delete.
 
 
P.M. But their view is explicitly related to economic point of view. We don’t contest
that. Prefer they shd. not go on to refer to proposals of R.T. &amp; B.
I.M. But even first part wd. prejudice case v. Grangemouth.
P.M. Better if all were omitted. But unwise to press them.
D.E. Deprecate delay. Recession in demand for steel is temporary. We shd. “buy the
shares at the bottom” &amp; be ready for re-expansion.
P.M. I wdn’t delay if I cd. get the decision.
H.A. Support D.E. Wd. be unfortunate to appear at this stage to lack faith in expanding
economy.
M. I will consider, with Bd., how management cd. be arranged if it had to be located
in Scotland. In a month.
Agreed : Consider again in a month.
