  <content>C.C.23(55) 13th March, 1958
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H., O.G.
RAB. Business for next week.
2. Industrial Disputes : Busmen.
I.M. Nothing to m’tenanance, garage workers or others outside c. London. To drivers
&amp; conductors in c. Ldn. 8/6 a week. Satisf. award. Good case for rise – none
since Sep. ’56. This is 4%. But not on c/living basis : recognition of special skill
&amp; diffy. of work. Unanimous award.
If L.T.E. stand on this, Union will prob. not strike. Don’t expect major strike.
H.W. Will cost nearly £1M. Ldn Transport have agreed plans to save £¾M. by
economies &amp; cuts in services, and the balance by removal of fare anomalies.
Phased over 6 months.
Agreed – stress that it is specific award for special skill ; &amp; will not cause general
increase in fares.
P.M. Even more – stress that money won’t be found by increasing deficit.
H.A. Avoid publicity as 4% increase. Put it as x % increase on total wage bill.
I.M. C/living index – publd. to-morrow – steady again for 4th. month running.
P.M. 1. Each side has to consider wtr they accept. No more money
Omit unless →[2. 2½% on total wage bill].
someone 3. But not qua c/living : skill and stress.
says 4% Soft pedal on “no increase in fares”. So long as there is no increase, no harm in
having a little public anxiety over this. Mght even help to avert strike action.
I.M. Don’t mention 2½% at all. Tribunal may turn down rlway claim altogether.
P.M. Don’t seem too pleased. They will say we have rigged the arbitration.
3. Summit Meeting.
P.M. Revised U.S. draft reply was better. Thght it wiser to thank them for some
improvement.
After Cab.’s last mtg I sent Tels. 141, 142 to W’ton.
Have just heard F.D. doesn’t like it. But I shall continue to work for somethg. on
lines of W’ton Tel. 142. Shall not send further message to U.S. until I have talked
to S.Ll., who will be back at week-end.
General support in Cab. for outline in Tel. 142.
O.G. Most of our Allies don’t want the pace to be quickened.
