  <content>C.C.73(58) 29th September, 1958
1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter C.S., W.D., E.H.
a) Far East.
S.Ll. U.S. Adminn. conscious of being “alone” – sensitive to p. criticism. Recognise
the off-shore islands are militarily untenable, but believe Chiang cd. not stand
w’drawal – &amp; Communist triumph wd. undermine W. posn. thro’ F/East.
Lines of settlement : demilitarise Islands, no ref. to Formosa, but diffy. will be
over legal title to Islands. Cession of sovereignty wd. undermine Chiang &amp; be a
defeat for U.S. policy.
P.M. Chiang is blackmailing U.S. – pushing them further than they wish to go. His
latest Press conference : v. tough line.
S.Ll. Public conference is not best route to solution.
P.M. Three possibilities – i) – iii) [not heard] Possible (iv) : get Chiang to w’draw on
mil. basis : to straighten the line : better than a negotiation leading to fake or weak
concln.
My mood is to wait before pressing any solution on them.
S.Ll. Possibility : P.M. note to K. asking him to exercise his influence for peace. If
U.S. concurred.
P.M. Will consider that. But in general I think that in this private diplomacy is better
than public – &amp; want to follow that theme vis-á-vis U.S. Mght send a private note
to K. Or do it thro’ Malik.
b) Jordan.
S.Ll. Sec. Genl’s report will be publd. to-morrow. No pressure for premature w’drawal
of Br. Troops – presentn. favourable to our case. Proposes roving U.N.
Ambassador. Taking tough line with Nasser.
Radio propaganda is better. No diffy. over oil after we go. Infiltrn. not serious.
Country quieter. Thus, the longer we stay, the more diff. politically for J. Govt. –
and for us. J. Govt. want to announce on 1/10 tht. our w’drawal will begin on
20/10.
Recommend tht. on 1/10 we shd. announce this and promise completion w’in 3
wks from 20/10. [and be completed in 3 weeks from that date.] Shd. be
practicable, with overflying Syria &amp; Lebanon : wdn’t matter if some admin.
troops cdn’t leave for few days after 20/10.
If regime collapses after we have gone, it will be said our policy has failed. But
we only intend to give them a chance – &amp; this we have done.
If we don’t act now, genl pressure will develop for our w’drawal – &amp; we shall
lose initiative.
W.D. This wd. be practicable. Can find ships on these dates.
P.M. Plan on assumptn. we leave nil behind.
W.D. Early clearance for air-lift is important.
 
 
S.Ll. Yes : no diffy. expected. Israel mght even welcome some going over them.
On policy – general approval of S.Ll.’s proposal.
P.M. Prepare “background” statement justifying our policy. We have at least won
time.
C.S. We cd. begin to move earlier – 10 days’ notice.
S.Ll. Prefer longer interval – to allow things in J. to settle down.
P.M. Agreed in principle – S.Ll. to have latitude to name an earlier date.
S.Ll. J. Govt. don’t want earlier date : unwise to suggest it to them.
S.Ll. Br. subjects in Jordan. Amb. at one time recommended their evacuation. Doubt
if they (300 in Amman &amp; 100 in Jerusalem of whom latter cd. go into Israel) are
in greater danger than those in Iraq or Lebanon. Non-essentials only 130. They
cd. in emergency be concentrated in Embassy. Wd. rock J. Govt. if they were
evacuated now.
P.M. Mass evacuation now wd. destroy all we have gained. We shd. watch posn. &amp;
encourage thinning-out if situation warranted it.
Agreed : no mass evacuation of civilians now.
2. Reserve Forces Bill.
C.S. Cd. call up 45.000 men w’out Proclamn. Sectn. A. (1st. real ex-regulars) Emerg.
Reserves (completed reserve oblign. but volunteered to take on). To fill holes in 2
Divns. we shd. need another 25/30,000 – from T.A. Propose therefore to make
reserve of volunteers for this, at £100 p.a. bounty.
Renewal of 1954 Act – for global war, when much larger nos. wd. be needed.
Must get them fr. Genl. Army Reserve. Those who served after ’48 only – wd.
give us all we need : both groups are now under the oblign.
P.M. Simple renewal wd. go thro’ w’out diffy. But addns. may cause comment. i) Callup
w’out Proclamn. at cost of £100 p.a. p. head – v. expensive, surely. ii) Global
war – will provoke discn. of all prepns. for that. Will open ques of N. Service –
shall we be able to dispense with it etc.,? Do we want a debate on that? If so,
better on basis of a safeguard v. its failure.
Suggest Cttee. comprising –
Home Secy, M/D., S/S. War, M/Labour with Fin. Secy. to consider and
report to Cab. on this, and on wider ques of powers to prolong N.S. if
policy of all-regular forces shd. fail. Also to consider M./L. adminve. ques
connected with end of N.S.
[Exit C.S. and W.D.
[Enter D.W-S.
3. Social Investment.
 
 
K. Introduced memo. Priorities have in fact bn. adjusted already; for social
investment has decreased as proportion of total.
[Enter A.L.B.
4. Cyprus.
P.M. Discussed with S.Ll. and A.L.B. We did not feel we cd. abandon or p’pone our
plan. Nor that Makarios’ offer shd. cause us to change our policy. T. has now
asked for agreement to appointmt. of their Cons. Genl. as their repve. under our
plan : they had already agreed tht. he shd. have no executive functions.
If conference were open or on basis of Spaak’s plan, T. wd. prob. decline to
come. Foolish, however to decline conference altogether – esp. as Gks. now
concede right of T. Govt. to participate. Therefore, final sentence of F.O. Tel.
1399 to Paris (NATO)
x | But propose to authorise Roberts to make it plain that adjustments of our plan wd.
| be accepted by us if agreed by all parties in the conference.
S.Ll. Agree. If we alienate T., they can stop all progress in Cyprus. In Gk. attitude I
believe there is an element of bluff.
H. Is final sentence not too restrictive?
H.W. Wd. aid us politically to have a conference.
S.Ll. T. agreement is on condn. tht. these words are used.
P.M. a.We cd. split final sentence in two. b.And add words to effect of x/. Mght be
better presentation.
After discussion – agreed a) but reserved b) for answer to ques.
[Exit A.L.B., S.Ll.
3. Social Investment (resumed).
Education.
H.A. Stems fr. July decns. on level of public investment in future years – 5% a year, wh.
exceeds prospective increase of G.N.P. That £75M. p.a. is as much as we dare
commit ahead. Sums seem small : but policy decisions are always taken on the
margin. Redn. is always more difficult than expansion. Dangerous therefore to
exceed July limits. To keep w’in them, we must cut by £90M. – 23M. on social.
Hardest treatment shd. be given to housing, wh. has done well for several years :
it shd. now have low priority. Prisons is de minimis. As betwn. hospitals &amp;
education : I agree some expansion on hospitals is overdue, but wd. like a cut of
£2 or 3 M. Education has done well recently – high capital expenditure for the
bulge &amp; that is no longer necessary by 1960/61 : had hoped for reductn. then in
investment for educn. other than Universities &amp; techn. educn. – esp. as we plan to
incur so much for those 2 branches. Can’t we have forward drive w’out this addl.
cap. expenditure – if we are doing all this on Univ. &amp; techn. and on the rest not
actually reducing after peak of bulge. Can’t M/Ed. hold it on basis of starts at
£46M.? He cd. still present this as expansion. If he won’t, poor chance of getting
contns. fr. other Dpts.
 
 
G.Ll. There is Ty. case for argument that decent amount of educ. advance is going on at
that figure. But it wdn’t be a forward drive, as contemplated by P.M. From my
angle it is starts, not work done, that are vital. See my para. 3 – £12M. below
level of 1956/57.
H.A. But in ’61 we shd. in real terms be spending 50% more than Labour did in ’51.
P.M. Fact is that many of secondary schools now are shams. Can’t pretend otherwise
w’out bldg. We really shd. be above £48M in 59/60, if we can say we are doing
somethg. for primary &amp; secondary. Put it as low as we can get away with.
H.A. I wd. try to make it no less than 58/59 viz., £51M. But I can’t accept that it must
be “significantly larger”.
K. Perhaps £52M.
J.M. For Scotland Ty. figures wd. mean tht. in 60/61 we shd. be doing less on primary
&amp; secondary that in current year.
I.M. Para 5 of F.S.T. memo. Social investment is going up by only £3.3M but H.A. is
trying to cut it back by £26M.
H. Can’t run Univ. and techn. expansion successfully unless [Exit H.W.
schools are better than they are.
H.A. Suggest we accept figure of £52M. [Taking £2M. off school meals &amp; minor
works.]
G.Ll. Cdn’t accept [ ] now.
P.M. You don’t need to announce that now for 60/61.
Agreed : G.Ll. and H.A. to confer on actual figure.
Hospitals.
D.W-S. Cut of £3M. cd. only come on allocation to Hosp. Bds. Can’t come on plant
replacement or major schemes. It wd. reduce Bds. from £14M. to £11M. No
increase in money terms for 4 years’ running – despite long years of neglect and
in time of rising prices.
H.A. Overall it wd. be £27½M. cpd. with £20M to-day.
I.M. Why not look at social investment together with the rest in October?
P.M. May be. But w’in s. investment, we must have our priorities. And I see
education as stronger runner than hospitals.
D.W.S. I cd. get by on splitting the difference – £1.5M. “w’out prejudice”.
Housing.
H.B. Can avoid announcement of 1960/61. Will discuss with H.A.
 
 
P.M. Let us take note of these provisional conclns. &amp; resume discussion when we have
proposals for remainder of public investment.
5. Housing Policy.
K. Will Bldg. Societies accept 5½%?
H.B. Believe they will – tho’ not the 5¾% favoured by Ty.
H.A. Agree to statement (P. Conference) in genl. terms – w’out committing us to
working thro’ B. Societies. Then negotiate with them before Queen’s Speech.
H.B. I wd. be content with that.
