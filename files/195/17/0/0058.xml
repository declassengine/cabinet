  <content>C.C.83(58) 4th December, 1958
1. European Free Trade Area. [Enter E.H.
R.M. Erhardt’s visit today. Propose to listen &amp; report.
P.M. Are we to accept negotns. betwn. 6 and 11. Or are we to insist on OEEC as forum.
R.M. At least it is for OEEC to say wtr another forum is desired.
Erhardt comes to see me as Chairman of the 6 : to see other Ministers as a
German Minister.
2. Indonesia : Supply of Arms.
S.Ll. We have refrained fr. supplying major items of equipment (ships &amp; Gannet
aircraft) because of views of Dutch and Australians – for fear of attack on D.N.
Guinea.
P.M. Shd. we re-consider our genl. policy : as other nations (even free world nations)
wd. be willing to supply. We can’t in fact control situation : why shd. we cut off
our nose to spite our face.
M’while I propose to give way on Gannets.
Agreed : concede Gannets.
review ships qua general policy ( : Arms W.Party).
[Exit S.Ll.
3. Parliament.
E.H. Business for next week.
Xmas recess : 18/12 – 20/i. Former date to be announced to-day.
4. British Aluminium Company. [Enter Erroll.
[Enter RA.B.
H.A. I am shareholder in T.I. Think it better not to take part in discussion. P.M. has
kindly taken mtg. on my behalf. Wd. be better if I also made announcement – it is
a large issue.
R.M. i) Qua getting dollars, there isn’t much in it. T.I. a little better.
ii) Qua interests of Co. as undertakg., Alcoa is better because brings
immediate increase in capital.
iii) Qua control, under Alcoa deal we shd. lose effective control. Under T.I.
control at 51% wd. be frozen in Br. hands.
From Exchange Control angle our duty is to consider only i) and iii), ii) is a more
genl. matter of interest to Govt.
Directors of Co. have entered into contract wh. is binding unless we w’hold
consent. So it is not open choice.
Erroll. Stedeford will ask for mtg. of shareholders if Alcoa plan is allowed to go fwd.
 
 
M. Mght it not be good thing for that to happen – w’out any Govt. statement.
K. Sympathise with that. But under E. Control Act. s 30 – consent of Ty. is required
for transfer of control from a Br. company.
Price under contract = 60/= Price under T.I. offer wd. be 78/=. Second price
hasn’t bn. put to shareholders. Shd. we not w’hold consent to first deal until
shareholders have had chance to consider second.
D.E. Portal shd. circulate his letter to shareholders (advocating Alcoa [Enter J.H.
proposition). We shd. defer decision m’while.
P.M. But they have made contract. Why consult shareholders now?
M. If we frustrate this contract, how hope to attract U.S. investment.
P.M. And what about our freedom of investment in oversea countries.
Portal wants to justify his action to shareholders.
Stedeford is trying to force a mtg. of shareholders.
Can we not therefore take the line tht. we won’t take a decision for a few days.
Avoid hurried decision. Indicate to Portal that it wd. be useful if his lr. were
published.
Case for delay : Alcoa is sounder economic proposition : good that public
discussion shd. bring this out : it wd. strengthen Govt.’s hand in taking the
sounder but less popular decision.
Agreed : let both sides know (thro’ R.M.) that we are not going to take a
decision in a hurry on facts at present before them (and before
shareholders and public).
5. I.M.F.
H.A. Renewal of our stand-by &amp; repaymt. of loans.
In Dec.’56 we got approval to draw $561M and stand-by for a further amount
$739 m not drawn. Latter expires 31/12. Do we ask for renewal? Gt.
convenience to have it. But, as our reserves have strengthened, it may be
questioned. Mtg. 21/12. Many countries will think sterling is now strong enough
to stand full convertibility. If we seek renewal, we shall be asked our intentns. on
x| convertibility. And chance of getting it will be improved if we promise further
move twds. c. during period of further stand-by (12 mos). Jacobson &amp; Anderson
both think we can now stand c.
Re-payment : Due to complete betwn ’60-’61. (?) But assumed we cd. repay
when we cd. And we shall be expected to do better than minimum compulsory
date. Propose therefore to offer lump-sum of $280 m. before 1.4.59 and balance
in monthly instalments thro’ 60-61. This shd. help us to get the stand-by.
R.A.B. What do we promise on x/.
H.A. Quoted from minute to P.M. – incldg. appendix.
P.M. If we say that, we shall be virtually committed to c. Is that wise?
H.A. Committed only if things went well.
 
 
P.M. And if they went ill cd. we not ask for another stand-by. Do we really want
renewal of stand-by on that basis?
D.E. Also involves additional provns. for repayment. Does that not suggest we don’t
need stand-by?
P.M. Yes – we don’t really need stand-by for purposes of c.
H.A. Cheapest cover v. any adverse movement.
R.M. If you don’t ask for renewal of standby, people will assume you don’t intend to
become c., &amp; that will damage credit.
H.A. Will increase our credit if we accelerate repayment but get renewed standby.
RAB. I agree – &amp; support that course. But proviso re c. – I’m content on that : but
worried at wording on non-discrimination. Don’t want too much of latter.
H.A. Mght. omit reference to non-discrimination.
P.M. V. well : let me see final text.
[Exit Erroll., E.H.
6. Pensions.
R.A.B. Recommend no major change. Explained details – as in memo.
H.A. Increment for continuing at work – needs some further thought. This wd. cost
£20M. by 1980. Subject to that, agree with remainder.
B.C. This is balance to change on earnings rule. I attach importance to it. Wd. like
further discussion in L.P.S. Cttee., if Ty. dislike it.
7. Cotton Imports.
D.E. Col. Claig (H.Kong Chairman) has done well : but has put up new points for
considn. by Cotton Bd. Two points still out-standing :-
i) towelling : likely to be overcome.
ii) escalation : Lancs. will refuse this proposal.
They must be able to say they have more stability, in order to facilitate reorganisation.
Indian agreemt. hasn’t got provn. for escalation : &amp; they will reopen
that if it’s included in H. Kong agreemt.
