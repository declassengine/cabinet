  <content>C.C.41(58) 13th May, 1958
1. Summit Meeting. [Enter E.H.
S.Ll. F.D. wdn’t concede principle : tho’ he wdn’t object to move on their side ad hoc
for a particular meeting.
P.M. Not v. sensible, or practical.
S.Ll. We have pledged ourselves tht., if mtg. is larger than 4, Italy shall be added on
our side.
P.M. Can’t break off on composition.
2. Antartic.
S.Ll. Have said, in H/C. y’day, tht. we wd. welcome a conference. Confined to nonmilitarisation
&amp; co-opn. on science, tho’ we wd. hope to add freezing of
sovereignty.
3. Security in Colonies.
K. As in memo.
P.M. Useful exercise. Can now be ended.
4. Territorial Waters. [Enter Att.G., Selk.
P.M. As in brief.
S.Ll. Plan wh. Iceland Govt. are considering now is :-
Extend base-line in accordance with proposal wh. commanded
majority at Geneva.
Proclaim 12 m. limit.
Allow those with historic rights to fish within 12 up to 4, subject to
condns.
Pressures are being m’tained &amp; they may come round. But Comm. elements are
strongly opposed, &amp; Govt. may fall.
Guidance needed, however, is what action we take re own trawlers if they do
unilaterally extend limit to 12 miles.
P.M. If a complicated move, we shd. have to object in principle to unilateral action but
shd. then take time to consider its effect. M’while no force.
If 12 miles flat, situation wd. be different.
J.H. Yes : we shd. then have to take some practical action. Fishermen cd. be
disciplined to fish w’in area Admy. wd. protect. We cd. then say we didn’t accept
unilateral decln. : wd. send warships to protect trawlers engaged in lawful fishing :
these wd. re-act to any violence shown by Iceland warships. On that basis I
 
 
believe I cd. dissuade them from a ban on landings, wh. is in any event ineffective
because 60% of Iceland’s fish goes to Soviet zone.
S.Ll. Diffies. i) Is such action practicable? ii) Risk to NATO base, wh. is essential to
early warning chain.
P.M. Not a NATO base. A U.S. base in a country wh. happens to be in N.A.T.O.
Att.G. U.S. mght fear tht. Iceland’s example mght be followed by Canada.
We can base action (force) on Corfu judgement. In law it wd. be fully justified.
It cdn’t be “passive” : our ships wd. have to prevent arrest of our trawlers.
S. i) Only means of stopping arrest wd. be to sink Iceland warship : That is
unthinkable. ii) Can’t put more than 2 or 3 ships there at a time. iii) H.M. ships
re-fuel in Iceland.
J.H. On ii) force cd. be augmented.
P.M. We shd. have a plan of action – incldg. reference to U.N. etc.,
K. x Cd. Att.G. provide clear statement of our powers in such a case.
Agreed : Att. Genl. to do x
Cttee. of F.O., Admy. &amp; M/Ag. to make plan for
military &amp; political action.
J.H. Co-opn. of trawlers wd. be needed to make plan workable. [Exit K., Selk.
5. Wages Policy : N.H.S. [Enter D.W-S.
Note not taken. [Exit D.W-S.
6. Butter.
H. As in memo.
J.H. i) Let it be final : no bargaining with Skinner. [Enter V. Morgan
S.Ll. Objective of weaning Poland away from R. This wd. be smack in face for them.
Nash shd. understand our need to keep them in our market.
P.M. We are not bound to continue this. If supplies decrease &amp; price rises, we must be
free to lift it.
SLl. Cd. we merely tell Poles “no more until 1st. Jan.”
V.M. Yes : no objn.
Avoid promise of 40.000 t. Can’t be sure. Announce measures, not result.
H. Shall promise statement by D.E. early next week. On B/T. day. Tuesday. Draft
to be settled by H.A. and R.A.B.
 
 
7. Agriculture : Assistance to Small Farmers.
H.A. Accept the “small farmers” scheme. Good &amp; easy to defend. The supplementary
plan is more difficult. There may be too many who will live on this w’out putting
in for the other. We shd. look again at scale of paymts under suppl. scheme.
Also appears now that only £10 M. of the £15 M. cd. be recovered under price
review. We cd. take it into a/c. in reln. to “tough” settlement : but doubt if we cd.
get it all back by that means.
Adminve. burden. 200-250 addl. staff. Strain on advisory services. Wd. sooner
see it started on a smaller scale.
J.H. Share this concern about suppl. plan. But i) already a marginal scheme, to end in
Aug. To continue it wd. cost £3 M. – as cpd. with my £5 M. This is the only new
money. It is for prodn. grants : wh. will increase efficiency &amp; incomes – wh.
helps us on price review. A safer method than guarantees.
On adminn. My Dpt. believe they can carry it. I don’t want to be committed
finally to size of plan, for I have to negotiate it with N.F.U.’s May I discuss
w’out commitment, &amp; seek final approval from Cabinet after my talks with
N.F.U.’s.
H.A. But depends on definition of qualification.
R.A.B. i) 45.000 of these are in N.I. If scope is reduced it will be blow to N.I.
ii) Designed to transfer paymt. to small farmer. Does it?
J.H. Yes : the £3 M. will rise to £4½.
H.A. And in all it will give another £12 M. less anything they lose on prices.
Agreed: M/Ag. to start discns. with N.F.U.’s, w’out commitment
&amp; preferably w’out disclosing details of definition
(income or acreage).
8. Egypt : Financial Negotiations.
Note taken.
M/State F.O., (O.G.) to be Chairman of interdepl. Cttee. to consider methods of
determining claims.
