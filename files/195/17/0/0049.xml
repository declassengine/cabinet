  <content>C.C.68(58) 27th August, 1958
1. Cyprus. [Enter A.N., Profumo, E.H.
P.M. Referred to 3 courses discussed at last Cabinet. Agreed to announce a modified
plan – with changes going as far as poss. to meet Gks.
Numerous tels. from Govr. Disposed to urge him to refrain any further
statements, appeals etc., For we have to decide now wtr to drop our plan or to go
ahead &amp; implement it w’out a lot of talk. Then concentrate on securing end of
emergency – the real immediate problem. Possibly, remove ban on the 5 exiles.
But “ending of emergency” means more than that : we have just arrested 2.000 or
so, w’out trial : we can hardly, in fairness to military, release them again.
Think we shd. go fwd. with our plan. But return of M. is linked with “ending of
emergency”. Must devise some statement about latter – on phased basis – if
preceded by period of calm.
Provocative dates : 1st. Oct., arrival of T. repve. : first election. Ques is wtr
“ending of emergency” shd. be between those dates or after both.
R.A.B. We cdn’t devise another plan wh. wd. hold Turks. Must therefore proceed slowly
with this plan. But security side must be handled cautiously – can’t make
‘concessions’ too quickly.
P.M. Dangerous, politically, to name a date for M.’s return. Better, perhaps, to say that
if over next [six] weeks violence ceases a phased plan will then be introduced for
relaxing emergency regulations, for return of exiles and for progressive release of
persons now under detention.
P. Opposed to committing ourselves now to a date for M.’s return. For once he is
back, we have no hold over his admirers.
R.A.B. I agree. Can’t take risk until evidence that violence is ceasing.
P. Wise to bring Govr. back for personal consultn.
P.M. Choice: (1) Let M. return after 1/10. Hope he will co-operate in
peace, not in plan.
(2) N.B.’s formula.
(3) Same as (2) w’out a date.
Disposed to ask Govr. to consider these &amp; return for consultn.
(C.C.69-71(58) inclusive : N.B. absent on annual leave.)
