  <content>C.C.83(57). 3rd December, 1957.
[Enter E.H.
1. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
F. Affairs debate : Thursday 19/12 – taking risk that N.A.T.O. mtg. may not end
cleanly on the Wed. To avoid debate on 9/12. i.e. before Paris mtg. Or, if mtg.
runs on into Thursday, take ½ day on 20/12 (Friday). Brief report to H/C. (on
Govt. side) vice debate : tho’ Opposn. wd. have chance to make speeches.
[Enter St. A.
2. Welsh Affairs.
P.M. Report published last Jan : time we acted on it.
Can’t reproduce in Wales the Sc. model of separate administration. But we must
do more by devolution, to satisfy Welsh opinion, even at some inconvenience.
H.B. Disadvantages to be avoided. K. went much to Wales : Ll.G. did not :
disappointment spread.
Report recommended Sc. model : no-one believes in that. No grief at
announcement that we shan’t follow that pattern.
Trouble over decision on Lpl’s water. This has touched off much deeper feeling
in Wales. : that decisions are reached w’out taking a/c of feeling in Wales.
Wrong to suppose tht. feeling is grounded in W. Nationalism or in economic
distress. If ignored, the reasonable people will be driven into arms of nationalists.
What can we do? M/State for Wales, who can spend large part of his time in
Wales.
Administrative devolution. Standing Cttee. of officials in
Wales, over which I preside, is v useful – in correcting excessive
departmentalism. There is a rural affairs sub-cttee. of this, &amp; I propose to create
economic sub-cttee. Wd. help if Dpts. had senior official stationed in Cardiff.
This general approach wd. be acceptable to our supporters in Wales.
It might also satisfy Council for Wales. Reasoned reply to their memo. coupled
with constructive &amp; sympathetic proposals of our own.
St. A We have already 800 offls. (out of 1400) under Welsh secretary – and balance are
mainly technical.
H.B. M/Ag. have done much : can’t ask that they shd. do more than keep possibility in
mind.
H.W. I will post Under Secy. to Cardiff : but must be understood that he will be there
only to assuage Welsh feeling – it wd. not be administratively sensible.
H.B. An Asst. Secy. wd. suffice. We feel need for opposite number.
G.Ll. Educn. authies. in Wales wd. deplore change. Present system was initiated by
David Ll.G. – in interests of Welsh education. Head of our Welsh Dpt. divides
his time betwn. Ldn. &amp; Wales.
H.B. Agree there is division of opinion. But due to personalities. But majority feeling
is that more shd. be done in Wales.
 
 
Can M/Ed. present situation in such a way as to imply tht. more is being done in
Cardiff? Can he also clear minds of Welsh experts? Working twds best
arrangement.
G.Ll. Will work something out : e.g. Asst. Secy. in Cardiff vice Principal.
K. Agree to plan for M/State.
But not sure tht. title “S of S. Wales” wd be unwise. Desired by Tory supporters,
who want to pre-empt such action by a Labour Govt.
A matter for P.M.’s decision.
P.M. S of S. title, without a Sc. system, may seem a swindle.
S of S. now-a days bear no relation to importance of duties.
J.M. Might provoke Scotland to ask for even more.
R.A.B. Against this. Future of Wales is bound up with England. Wd. be abuse of oldest
Ministerial title. Trouble in Scotland. Not in best interests of Wales. Prefer to go
no further than new M/State.
After discussion – generally, agreed that “S of S. for Wales” would be rather
bogus. Dissenting voices also heard.
3. Wages.
…………
H.W. Vital to general policy that we shd. not break the front, even on a minor case
Keep open the possibility that we may have to have a “wages policy”.
M. Diff. to imagine that when ⅔rds. of field is covered by arbitn. &amp; we have
promised not to destroy that. My advice : avoid any general statement &amp; be free
to handle each case on its separate merits.
Hail. Diff. to resile from our genl. statements in support of collective bargaining and
arbitration.
P.T. We ought to consider at some stage possibility tht. national interest wd. be put
before arbitration tribunals.
K. When will Cohen Cttee. give a report.
P.T. Have urged expedition.
Ch.H. Any action in public sector will be v. closely scrutinised. There are some 7
N.H.S. Whitley awards before M/H. now ; and one is for as much as 50%
increase. All are cases where no increase has bn. given since 1956.
D.W.S. One of these is award by Industrial Court.
P.T. Presentn. is v. important. Need a mtg. of Ministers to consider all the Whitley
awards.
 
 
I.M. 1) Don’t believe independent members of arbitn. tribunals will take any more
pressure fr. Govt. They wd. resign.
2) Remember what a small field of wages we can influence. We can’t get a
wage freeze in this country – beyond our power.
H. Need not push any independent member by giving evidence of national interest.
R.A.B. Favour review of negotiating machinery. We need a new attitude twds it. E.g.
Whitley machinery – much outside our control. We shd. have view on it. Are we
to do this thro’ officials – or thro’ independent enquiry.
H.W. Still a problem for future – even if we get thro’ this round.
P.M. V. diff. problem. Ques do we attack it on principle or on individual merits. But
there are some principles we cd. establish.
E.g. i) Different types of arbitration. Which do we want to keep.
ii) Old collective bargaining between master &amp; man – employers
functioning in open market &amp; public interest automatically
safeguard. What diff. system shd. be devised for public sector
where monopoly position can be exploited. What sanction can be
used for these?
iii) Whitley Council area – a) State servants where employer pays b)
semi-public like N.H.S. where employer doesn’t pay. What shd.
be guiding principles for wages in this sector? Even “comparable
rates outside” is a principle which was more appropriate when
public service was much smaller.
iv) Govt. national wages policy – in sense of fixing an annual pattern
of increase. If that impractical, cd. Chandos’ idea be used?
v) What action shall we take on a report by Cohen Cttee? Circulate it
more widely than to arbitn. tribunals alone. In public sector at any
rate shd. natl. interest be openly represented? – because not
subject to market control.
I.M. Don’t see any benefit in following this line.
Arbitration : we may decide to drop Ind. Disputes Order, without putting anything
in its place.
Whitley Council – in industry (far more numerous) no conceivable Govt.
sanction. Market operates.
P.M. But what about monopoly – e.g. transport.
I.M. They wd. never go to arbitn. if provision were made for natl. interest to be
considered.
M. Other natd. indies. have statutory arbitration.
R.A.B. M/L. puts classical view. But strong pol. feeling the other way.
[Exit DW-S.
4. Government Business.
P.M. Believe H/C. will accept Junior Ministers more readily.
