  <content>C.C.27(58) 27th March, 1958
1. Rent Act. [Enter E.H., O.G.
P.M. Summarised political issue for considn.
On facts : a) control ceases after x generations : 20/30.000 houses a year
come out of control, painlessly, by this means.
b) Was this particular method of easement, as now proposed, put
fwd &amp; rejected during passage of Bill.
H.B. a) Since 1939, house hasn’t become de-controlled : but l’lord wd. gain vacant
possession : if he let it again, it wd. become again subject to control.
b) Point was not raised or argued during Cttee. stage of Bill.
H. Genl. pol. arguments v. Bill are v. strong.
Cd. Opposn. organise such a campaign v. this Bill as to torpedo main Act? No :
because p. opinion is not against principle.
Effect on agreements already made. In main, people who have done so have
made reasonable bargain.
Pol. agitn. on evictions wd. be really disastrous.
On reflectn. I conclude that a narrow Bill is best course : subject to consideration
of possibility of giving discretion to Ct. to fix rent subject to minimum.
R.M. Hard to justify eviction of tenants who can prove they have tried both to reach
agreement and to find accommodation.
J.H. Agree : as narrow as possible.
M. Those who have made agreemts wdn’t be upset by this.
Bill is logical end to H.B.’s assurance to H/C. that hardship wd. be relieved. But
politically damaging.
Hail. We shdn’t get into posn. tht. all evictions will come at one time. Support
proposals as they stand.
D.E. Relief must be provided. Many old passive people may not be able to show they
have tried. How do we help these? Some intermediary betwn. them &amp; l’lord.
Bill shd. provide for this.
K. Favour Bill. If none, from Oct. to Dec. old &amp; disabled wd. be being put out by
bailiffs – more wd. need to be provided. Equitable that these classes shd. be
given some help. Bill must be narrow. Hope H.B. will consider restricting test
(c) : also restn. of period to 6 mos. at a time and 12 in all. Cases shd. be spread
over a time.
H.A. Favour Bill. Damage from criticism of mis-estimating effects will be less than
that we wd. get for w’spread hardship.
Worried about agreemts made.
Hope Whip will tell us more of attitude of supporters.
A.L.B. Doubtful. Prefer no decision to-day. Fear this will shake confidence in principle
of main Act : Bill mght be used to run campaign which wd. wreck main Act. Lets
our supporters down – who have stood up for Act.
Shall we be better off in 9 months’ time.
 
 
I wd. prefer remedial assistance in special cases – old and sick.
I.M. Better than panic legn. in Oct. – &amp; I believe we wd. be driven to that. This is too
large for adminve. action. Must hear Whip – on view of supporters.
Duration of Bill : must be 3 years.
H.W. Must accept H.B.’s view on ques wtr it can be done by adminn. Agree somethg.
must be done. If there has to be legn., Bill is too broad.
Ch.H. V. gt. blow to pol. prestige of Govt. In average areas we have battled this thro’.
Pity to have to do this for a v. few areas. Can we now estimate size of problem?
In Luton, fear of what might happen was worse than what happened. Nos.
shrinking weekly, as agreements are made.
E.H. Wd. be v. gt. shock to Party. Most have battled thro’, on main Bill. Only 3
abstainers on a vote. Their “ambulance” idea was administrative relief. Bill – or
its effect – may stultify our main case for Act. Minister has bn. saying it’s too
early to estimate final result – certainly not before Apl. 6.
Of course, Party wd. be equally incensed at situation in October.
H.B. Talk to Party to-day. Expectn. of some Govt. action.
Presentation. Bill must be made to look uncomfortable – no encouragement to
tenants to hang on &amp; doing nothing.
Wd. like to explore rent of 2½ times flat plus provision for N.A. Confine hardship
therefore to people who can’t find other accommodation &amp; not extend it to those
who are too poor to pay rent demanded.
Whatever we do by adminn., there will always be some small core. Cdn’t clear
them all off in 12 months – more likely 2 years.
Discretion cd. be betwn. 3 and 9 mos.
Do not believe this will wreck main Act. Per contra believe it will induce more
agreements under that Act.
Tory Party wd. suffer for years if we allowed label of inhumanity to be applied
because of what will otherwise happen in October.
Timing : repeated 4 arguments used this morning.
P.M. General view : regret at having to make some compromise on main Bill. But now
we are concerned with arguments : Tories will feel differently when ques of facts
– actual evictions.
In principle, we agree tht. some such action will have to be taken.
x| At Tuesday’s Cab. let us have revised statement of heads of Bill. The 2
| Ministers plus K. Narrow appln. other points. raised in discussion. Also draft
| of announcement. Also timing and handling of Tories in H/C. Probably
| Wedy. is best.
Agreed.
2. Meeting of Heads of Governments.
P.M. * Statement of W. attitude twds mtg of Heads of Govts. will be issued on behalf
of 3 W. Powers who attended earlier Geneva mtg.
K. has succeeded B., who has resigned.
 
 
R. are likely to announce to-day unilateral suspension of tests. If they do, I shall
decline to make any immediate statement. Nature of our attitude will need to be
considered by Cabinet.
* N.A.T.O. have approved ad ref. to Govts. U.K. stated we want to get it out
by wk-end. They have agreed also to name a date (? 14 April) for start of
diplomatic negotiations.
3. European Free Trade Area.
R.M. Fr. are isolated. But they rely on support of G., whose Govt. is divided on this.
Adenauer may be persuaded during visit Ldn. In end we may come to special
treatment for Fr. Can we indicate we will be ready to consider concessions to Fr.
Commonwealth preferences. Fr. plan refers to sharing these. Argument tht. e.g.
U.S. motor trade wd. establish factories in U.K. to get Comm. as well as Europ.
advantages. Fr. unwilling to give anything in exchange. We shd. decline to pay
this price for entering a E.F.T.A. Danger : Austr. mght reduce their preference to
us &amp; saying we must compensate from Europe. We may have to fight this alone :
&amp; find ourselves isolated.
No decisions required now. Shall continue to argue, on preferences i) against
GATT. ii) for Commonwealth, not us.
D.E. Threat to preferences is v. serious.
Two sorts of preference. Some countries can narrow preference to U.K. by m.f.n.
Not large margin : but U.S. wd. like to see it reduced. But Fr. plan is tht. six shd.
share in our margins on discriminatory basis. Br. industry wdn’t accept our
bargaining this advantage away for sake of French : indeed we have assured them
that it will be preserved.
Some campaign in Europe to show Imp. pref. is not Colonialism : we give
advantages in exchange : if C. countries reduced pref. to us we shd. have to re-act.
H. Might develop into strong attack on Imp. preference. Tempting therefore
x| to turn down Fr. plan publicly – but that mght wreck E.F.T.A.
Also, some C. countries will stand firm : tho’ some, like N.Z., mght be tempted.
R.M. must keep x/ in mind.
R.M. Hasn’t bn. tabled openly. We may be able to strangle it at birth.
In public I shall go on saying C. system is balanced system in wh. no one can
share rights w’out obligations. In private I shall say unacceptable.
H.A. Scared of this because A &amp; N.Z. fear that no expansion of our market. This wd.
be v. tempting to them.
R.M.’s present line is enough. But he may need quick decision at any moment.
We mght want to say a sharp No : but diff. if we found other C. countries wanted
to make such concession.
R.M. Worst danger = line-up betwn. some C. countries and Europe. Don’t think it will
happen.
H. How cd. we warn A &amp; N.Z.
D.E. Tell them we are telling Fr. we are not entering into discn. with them on sharing
Imp. preference. Indicate diffies. of such multi-lateral bargaining.
 
 
R.M. We have told them v. much this.
H. Cd. France be left out of E.F.T.A. for period of years?
R.M. Fr. are v. that. So are E.C.E. But it wd. be best solution.
Hail. Cd. we drive wedge btwn Fr. and G.?
R.M. Rift w’in G. Govt. Erhardt is wholly of our view.
O.G. Erhardt is swayed by econ. consns. Adenauer is moved by pol. considn. tht. he has
healed breach betwn F. &amp; G., and wants to go down in history with that to his
credit.
D.E. Consider at some stage what we cd. do if E.F.T.A. project broke down.
