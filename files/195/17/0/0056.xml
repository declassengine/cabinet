1. Egypt : British Refugees. [Enter E.H. : H. Millar.
H.A. Bank’s offer to negotiate settlement may lead to soln. But can’t yet tell &amp; want
somethg. to hold posn. temporarily – with refugees and in H/L.
H.M. No escape from doing this : tho’ doesn’t improve our bargaining posn. with E.
Hail. Have promised in H/L. a limited extension. Debate in Nov. 11th. May have
thereafter to ask for more.
Agreed : announcement to be made in both Houses.
[Exit H. Millar.
2. Foreign Affairs.
a) Cyprus.
P.M. Gks. can’t face the conference because Makarios has bm. criticised by others for
abandoning Enosis. False statement fr. Gk. F.O. Wd. be useful therefore if
documents are publd. This is now agreed. We will give summary in debate &amp; lay
W. Paper with texts if that is asked for.
At least N.A.T.O. now realises we have bn. reasonable.
Continue to spk. of it calmly.
b) Free Trade Area.
D.E. Fr. posn. now so isolated that U.S. might weigh in.
P.M. Must discuss with Maudling on his return. No bargain with de G. – this v. his tripartite
plan.
Political settlement is only way out.
3. Parliament.
R.A.B. Business for next wk.
Debate on Address will be completed on Tuesday.
P.M. Good effect of having had no spill-over.
4. Employment.
D.E. Concerted campaign to bring deputns. from ‘black-spot’ areas. – or allegedly
black. Do we see all, or none, or select?
I.M. Begin by seeing them – &amp; see how it goes. Divide work betwn. Dpts. concerned.
P.M. Don’t refuse.
 
 
5. Internatl. Labour Organisation.
Approved.
6. Egham : Caravan Site.
H.B. Injunction obtained. Sites Co. are in contempt if they don’t comply. Seen l.a.’s
(C.O. &amp; Egham). Local people are enraged : crooked firm : squatters. Egham
won’t give them another site.
Of original 150, 90 have left. Remainder are trying to make trouble and won’t
look for other sites.
Have urged l.a.’s to work out solution. At present no site in Surrey to wh. they
can go with caravans.
Egham won’t evict – certainly not for 2 wks. &amp; prob. not before end/Nov.
But the co. have now gone back to Cts.
K. Risk of mandamus v. my Bailiffs for not carrying out orders because I have told
them not to use brutal methods.
Cdn’t l.a.’s take a more constructive line.
Att.G. Has continued since ’55 – moving from site to site as planning permission
refused. LCJ. gave injunction to operate in Aug. Appln. to Donovan J to extend :
he gave up to Oct. /Nov. 5/ date &amp; expd. view they were trespassers. L.a. ought to
move them : entitled to use force.
Trailer Co. &amp; land-owner are now in contempt. I propose to move for their
attachmt.
K. They will then say in defence tht. La. Ch. hasn’t helped them,.
H.B. Site at Windlesham offered for 28 days : Bagshot has asked me to prevent this
under Planning Acts.
x| Am considerg wtr we cd. get local enquiry – where cd. they go. But
I don’t want to seem to be interfering with course of justice.
Att.G. No objn. to x/.
Agreed : H.B. to proceed as at x/.
H.A. Cttee. to keep under review.
