  <content>C.C.42(58) 13th May, 1958
1. Lebanon.
S.Ll. Described situation in Lebanon.
Chehab, C-in-C. Lebanese Army, is opposed to Chamoun. If he wished to do so,
he cd. control internal security w’out aid.
Chamoun wishes to stand again for Presidency, but wd. have to amend the
constitution in order to do so. We wd. have preferred to find another pro-western
candidate, but none can be found ; &amp; we &amp; U.S. have therefore agreed to back C.
for re-election.
Posn. is deteriorating. Can only be held if we &amp; U.S. promise intervention in
response to an appeal from him. Unless we arrest this drift, Lebanon will be
absorbed into U.A. Republic. Chamoun has also made his appeal to France.
Form of intervention : small no. of troops to help m’tain order.
D.S. Act quickly.
H. Wise to involve ourselves in internal politicis of L.?
Wd. it not have bn. better to complain of Syria to U.N. and Anglo-U.S. forces go
in to hold sitn. until U.N. force can be extended to Leb.-Syria border.
P.M. Main burden – mil. and U.N. – will be carried by U.S.A.
If L. were forced into U.A.R., serious blow to us. Iraq cd. hardly stand out.
If U.S. see this danger &amp; are ready to act, shd. we not associate ourselves with
them?
Pity the French were asked too – because of effect on Arab opinion.
S.Ll. Jebb thinks they wd. gladly back out, if pressed.
P.M. Copy of our outgoing tel. shd. go to Wright (Bagdad) – who shd. be asked to
protest if likely to offend Iraq.
S.Ll. Agree that we must keep on side with U.N.
H. More than that, there may be ground &amp; opportunity now to charge Egypt and
Syria with aggression v. a small neighbour.
S.Ll. It must not impede immediate military action. There is danger in H.’s suggn. from
that angle.
Agreed : Spk. to U.S. as proposed.
Keep French out.
Bring Iraq along.
2. Cyprus.
P.M. Regret to have to re-open earlier decision to move boldly to tri-dominium. But
Govr., on internal receptn. &amp; Ambassadors, on receptn. in Athens &amp; Ankara were
critical ; and F.D. lukewarm. Therefore asked Govr. to return for consultn. and
together we evolved alternative plan in C.106.
