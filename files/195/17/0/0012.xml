  <content>C.C.19(58) 27th February 1958
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
[Enter S., P., Str.
2. British Forces in Europe.
H.A. Estimates assume £47 M. of support costs fr. G. N.A.T.O. has bn. favourable to
us – &amp; report of the 3 was sympathetic. Don’t want to alienate that support.
G. have recently made offer which mght be tolerable for 1958/59. Not yet certain
what is meant by it.
P.M. has discussed with Ministers concerned.
i) £45 M. debt repayment wd. not help b/p. because £67 already
deposited in Ldn., but wd. show in Budget above the line.
ii) £50 M. twds. defence orders – wd. be only 12/18 months ahead of due
dates.
Propose we accept this for 58/59 subject to amendment plus a statement of our
intentions for the future – 5 brigade groups for 3 years beginning 58/59
(viz., 45.000 vice 55.000 to which we are now aiming to run down.)
Propose first to seek support of U.S. and consult Spaak
M’while we wd. alone consider stream-lining Br. forces to reduce use of G.
labour to minimum.
Cost of m’taining 5 brigade groups wd. be £37 M. of which we wd. hope to get
£12 M. p.a. thro’ N.A.T.O. 4 brig. groups wd. cost £32 M.
S.Ll. Fatal to NATO if we carried out threat to w’draw our forces. Choice therefore is
to go for this year settlement only or seek 3 year basis at cost of £20-25 M. p.a. on
U.K. b/payments.
This offer gives NATO &amp; G. time to work out means of relieving us.
Will consult Spaak. Wd. like also to enlist support of Norstadt.
H.A. Can’t avoid this. But heavy cost – in period when we have substantial debt
repayment to meet.
D.S. 4 is bare minimum for our contn. to NATO. 5 is more sensible. Cd. not accelerate
run-down : wd. be v. hard to get down to 4.
P.M. We are in v. gt. difficulty. i) Our legal oblign. is to keep 4 Divns. ii) We can’t
w’draw our men because nowhere to put them. iii) Diffce. in cost betwn. 4 and 5
brigade groups is only £2 or 3 M.
Must break stalemate – while we have sympathy of N.A.T.O.
Wd. be error to seek formal release from i).
Understandings: a) Run-down of Army generally to be accelerated.
b) 77.000 Br. in BAOR &amp; 2nd. T.A.F. 52.000
Germans in support. We must reduce the propn.
in support.
J.H. a) will be difficult. On b) I believe there is scope for economy.
[Enter Att. G.
 
 
3. Territorial Waters.
Att.G. Propaganda by R. Lobbying behind scenes.
We may get more support for 3-mile limit than we thght, but can’t carry it.
U.S. supportg. Canadian plan – wh. was devised to prevent U.S. trawlers from
fishing inside theirs on c. seabord. Cd. this be overcome by bi-lateral agreemt.
Chances of holding 3-mile limit are small. Tho’ ⅔rds. majority is required.
Shd. we therefore support U.S. line? We doubt if it will stave off extension of 3-
mile limit. Two ques are being handled in difft. Cttees. Have so informed U.S.
Delegate. He has no fall-back position. Our support mght increase chance of
U.S. plan being accepted. But that wd. weaken our case in Int. Ct. against an
individual State wh. claimed fishing up to 12 miles.
Believe best chance of compromise is 6 miles all round. Worth trying for that.
U.S. defence people oppose it – think it contrary to our own interests. But wd. be
better to run one compromise than two : &amp; we wd. sooner see U.S. join forces
with us on 6 miles.
x| Can we have authy. to work for 6 miles – subject to right of passage for
| aircraft &amp; warships betwn. 3 and 6 miles.
Proposals will be made on nuclear tests. This will involve long debate. May be
tht. whole conference may break down in consequence – because no agreemt. can
be reached in 10 weeks allowed for conference.
J.H. Agree tht., if defeated on 3 mile, best course wd. be to try for 6 miles.
If confce. breaks down, what is effect?
Att.G. Influence on view of Int. Court in determining individual cases.
H.W. Best to avoid any vote on terr. waters – &amp; keep status quo.
Att.G. Little chance of that.
H.W. Agree 2nd. best course is to go for 6 miles.
D.S. Vital that, if 6 miles, we shd. get provisos at x/.
Att.G. Hope we can approach U.S. Govt. on 1 compromise proposal (6 miles) vice two.
– subject to concurrence of their Delegate.
(I will tell our friends we can’t support 12 miles for fishing.
(Our fall back posn. is 6 miles, with provisos.
Agreed. (I will keep Cabinet informed.
(Approve last 5 lines of Att.G. paper.
H. Cd. prob. influence India to support 6 miles.
[Exit D.S. &amp; 4 invitees.
4. Agriculture Bill.
P.M. Are we sure we shd. go on with this?
J.H. Have adjusted Bill slightly in favour of tenants.
 
 
Agitation v. removal of Part II has subsided – was artificially provoked by
N.F.U.’s On security of tenure agreement with NFU’s. Back-benchers
unanimous in favour of going forward.
Str. Urgent need to rectify inheritance position in Scotland. Recognised to be unjust.
Tho’ there will be controversy.
R.A.B. Feeling has died away a little.
HA. We shd. lose more prestige by going back now than by going on.
5. Nuclear Power. I.B.R.D. Loan.
H.A. My predecessor was keen on this. I am equally keen. Shd. lose no chance of
supportg. reserves on long-term basis – &amp; this wd. be 20/25 yrs.
Black will be here next week : we must give him an answer. He has said we cd.
prob. get more later than initial loan of $50 m each from Bank &amp; market. Prefer
both loans to be raised by industry – tho’ if that proved disadvantageous to us
loan on market cd. be obtained by Govt.
M. Para. 1 of my memo. concedes tht. there may be over-riding case on financial
grounds. But I don’t w’draw objns. set out in para. 2.
People will think we can’t do it w’out this help.
Danger of refusal on technical grounds – wh. cd. be v. damaging.
Para. 3. Hope Govt. will raise the loan on market – cheaper, less complicated and
wdn’t need legn.
H.A. On last point have no hard view.
R.M. Share psychol. fears of M. But can’t push them too far in view of our dollar
diffies. Think it wd. be mistake to force industry on to Wall St.
S.Ll. Are the political risks worth taking for $100 m.?
Effect on Congress? MacMahon Act etc.,
P.M. Worried about chances presented to U.S. atomic people to get their knives into
our affairs – to discredit our achievements &amp; throw doubt on our future.
c. Zita story : v. discreditable to U.S.
Discussion adjourned.
