  <content>C.C.64(58) 24th July, 1958
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.
R.A.B. Monday. Debate on defence. They will expect D.S. to spk. mainly on ques of
organisation. Will try to get Oppn. to agree to announce it as “defence, with
particular reference to ques of central organisation for defence”.
P.M. This is price for avoiding further debates on F. Affairs.
R.A.B. Adjourn 31/vii. Shall have to promise recall if necessary. Statement next week
on re-assembly – spill-over etc.,
2. Middle East.
S.Ll. i) K.’s reply. We must see tht. Summit mtg. is confined to M/E., and that
settlement on Lebanon &amp; Jordan is obtained before wider debate.
Representatives of Arab countries – 10 : cd. be ridiculed. Can’t agree to
Monday – prob. early August.
ii) Lebanon. Signs of realism – need for domestic agreement – Murphy at
work on this. Leave it to him.
iii) Jordan. Uneasy situation. Best means of re-assuring them is that we are
opening supply route thro’ Aqaba. Israel is causing trouble by leaking re
possibility of stopping air-lift to Amman.
iv) Iraq. Wright thinks many members of new Govt. are horrified at events.
Mainly Liberal. Communists are disposed to oppose it. At least there are
some reasonable elements in it.
H.A. B/E. have bn. considering wtr Iraq Bank shd. be allowed to draw on deposits.
Jordan Govt. had sought to veto it, qua Arab Union. Legal advice : Union had no
rights : Iraq Bank under control of Iraq Govt. F.O. and legal advice co-incide in
favour of allowing Iraq Bank to draw on their sterling deposits. B/E. are now
continuing normal dealings – tho’ w’drawals outside sterling area will continue to
require Ty. approval.
P.M. Court mourning. All precedents suggest no need – save for monarchs related to
our R. Family or special cases e.g. Roosevelt. But it wd. be wise if some service
were held : Ld. Chamberlain wd. then go.
CLOSED UNDER THE
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT 2000
[Exit S.Ll., D.S.
3. Parliamentary Privilege.
R.A.B. V. little to say. Nothing new on P.Q.’s. Can’t modify rule v. ques on day-to-day
adminn. of natd. industies.
 
 
No point in referring this to Cttee. on Procedure. This matter really can’t be
resolved. On this aspect therefore I propose to say nothing.
Cd. be mentioned in my evidence to Cttee. on Procedure in the autumn.
P.M. Are they more worried about posn. of natd. Indies. or about libel actions.
R.A.B. The latter. Therefore I am going to make a statement on that aspect. Outlined
lines of statement.
G.Ll. Natd. indies. : firms in contract with them are nervous of making complaints for
fear of natd. industry taking it out of them.
G.W. Not when there is a real volume of complaint.
R.A.B. Will send copies round to Ministers – welcome any comment offered over week-end.
[Enter Marples, D.W-S., Bevins.
4. Investment Programme : 1957-62.
H.A. As in memo.
M. Crux is para. 21. Growth in G.N.P. Task of coal &amp; electricity &amp; atomic energy
is to enable that growth to develop.
P.M. Injection of investment may i) increase volume of production but ii) in some cases
may serve only to reduce cost of same volume of production.
M. Much needed merely to m’tain production volume.
P.M. And 4th. element = investment for social ends.
R.A.B. Why can’t we get back to increasing rate of production – as in 1952 – *? Great
need now is to revive that movement. We compare ill with Germany &amp; others.
Wdn’t want to hot up housing. Done v. well on this, already. Not keen on public
sector generally – save the utilities. We shd. put most of our effort into private
sector, with a view to increasg. productivity.
M. Doubt if this distinction is so sharp. Stimulatg. public expenditure is best way of
getting private industry going.
H.A. RAB right in reln. to long-term : not in short run, to cure unemploymt. Private
investment in industry must be m’tained for longer-term.
If we want to stimulate employmt., unwise to put up consumptn. (because means
more imports &amp; b/p diffies.) : wiser to go for exports and investment – which, at
2nd. remove, will in fact stimulate consumer expenditure.
H.W. Confine ourselves to orders which wd. go to our capital goods industries.
ALB. Endorse para 23. This is minimum required to enable us to invest overseas as we
should. Failure of some recent Colonial loans.
H.A. Won’t be easy to reach the figure given in para 23 ………
 
 
I.M. ……. Agree with D.E. We shall need a sharp stimulus to pull thro’ end of U.S.
recession. By Jan. we shall prob. reach 3% of unemployment = 800.000., if no
change. We ought to prevent that. Believe public investment wd. be quick-acting
remedy.
Local black spots. Bill is now through. Cttee. examining means of relief. Want to
consider selective action directed to those – on investment.
P.M. General target for next year – increase by £75 M. W’in that total plan selectively
in light of points raised in discussion.
M’while, before recess, wd. wish to get authy. to stimulate employmt. in
remainder of current year. A total &amp; also indication of best directns. Unobtrusive
action – no statement.
H.A. Agree – ready for decision on short-run next week.
P.M. Selection. Housing useful for providing emplt. Not politically necessary.
H.A. It is short-run expedient. Cd. make correspondg. redn. in long-term p’mme
E.M. Limits are now fixed in terms of money. Wage increase therefore means cutting
back p’mmes. This makes last sentence of para 4 unattainable. Suggest therefore
we plan in real terms, not money value. Suggest we also get agreed definition of
what is investment. For us it includes quite a lot of removals (e.g. telephones).
Consider productive industries separately from non-productive. And extent to
wh. firms plough back profits.
Finally select industries where new orders wd. yield quick results.
Education.
G.Ll. This is not a Dpl. proposal – it is based on pol. desire to overcome 11+ difficulty.
We can’t afford to stand wholly on defensive re secondary modern school.
Basis of my plan : maximum of pol. as well as educational advantage w’in
financial limits which cd. be accepted. See para. 15. net increase on current
expenditure of only £6 M. This achieved by a) capital expenditure and b)
concentration on secondary education. Growing recognition of value of
education. More children staying after compulsory age. Steady 10% in grammar
schools. In secondary modern schools only 5% : but only 20% of those schools
can give the extended course : thus real increase measured by desire is much
higher. The 80% are really old elementary schools which can’t give full benefits
of ’44 Act. Technologists – can’t be produced save from children staying on until
16 or 17.
H.A. Wd. mean committg. ourselves to spending £105 M. addl. over 1960-65.
G.Ll. Burden in 1960/61 (Ty.’s worst year) would not be v. great.
P.M. Political importance of a theme. Can’t rely on housing in next phase – and
anyway v. expensive. If we decide to do this, we shd. produce a Wh. Paper in the
autumn. Plan practical p’mme which causes least diffy. in terms of finance.
R.A.B. We shd. present it together with prisons, hospitals. And see that we have made a
start before Election.
P.M. RAB to work out plan accordingly, with H.A., (or J.E.S.) G.Ll. and D.W.S.
 
 
Hail: Cd. we be ready to make this the theme for next Party Conference in October.
5. Teachers : Training.
G.Ll. Ty. accept this. But some Ministers prefer to delay announcement until early
autumn. I accept that.
H.A. My own view, not on financial grds., is tht. we shd. not extend training period to 3
years. Shan’t get enough teachers at 3 yrs.
G.Ll. V. difficult to go back on announced policy.
H.A. Ready to accept scheme.
6. Malta Dockyard.
A.L.B. Project for firm to take over.
Want authority to announce before H/C. rises.
Agreed.
7. Prince Charles.
P.M.
CLOSED UNDER THE
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT 2000
But she has decided to announce creation of Prince Charles as P. o. W. No
ceremony until he comes of age.
