  <content>C.C.34(58) 24th April, 1958
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
D. of Industry Bill : M/L. to be i/c in absence abroad of D.E. (* Inform Ty.)
2. Foreign Affairs.
S.Ll. (a) Summit Mtg. We are to-day presenting, with U.S. &amp; France, a note
briefly stressing advantages of joint mtgs during preliminaries. Believe Soviet
Union will soon press suggn. of larger Soviet bloc repn. at Summit Mtg. We must
align our views on this with U.S.
P.M. Don’t object to facing that now, if U.S. were willing.
R. look as tho’ they are trying to slip out of the Mtg. Evident that whole thing is
manoeuvre.
(b) German Support Costs.
H.A. Favourable agreement reached. They wd. support redn. of our Forces to 45.000
(fr. 55.000) starting in 12 mos’ time. This year £12M to costs : £22½M advance
repayment of debt (1962/1964 paymts. onwds) – fr. deposits in Ldn : £50M
deposit (across exchanges) for defence order repayment. All this for 58/59. In
next 2 yrs. they wd. pay £12 M. to support costs.
Thus this year £34½ M. to Budget &amp; £62 M. across exchanges.
But force redn. wd. still have to be negotiated in W.E.U. &amp; N.A.T.O. Line to be
taken there : acquiesce in present unwillingness of Allies to assent to 45.000 but
hope they will assent in future – discussions to continue. But our def. plans are
based on assumptn. tht. Forces in G. will come down to 45.000 fr. beginning of
next fin. year.
D.S. I want clear basis for planning. But evident Norstadt will oppose.
Propose we go to NATO (not W.E.U.) &amp; seek their approval. Say we don’t
intend to go to WEU until NATO have had chance to consider wtr they can
supplement G.’s payment for one more year. This wd. mean in effect a U.S.
contribn. We shd. decline to find any more money.
If NATO approval is delayed, our chance of getting it may shrink.
S.Ll. Wd. wish to test temperature when in Copenhagen. Want to get U.S. support.
P.M. F.O., Ty., M/D. to concert a line on this, before D.S. goes to Copenhagen.
(c) Libya.
S.Ll. P.M. visiting : we can’t give him as much money : we must show him favours.
 
 
3. Poliomyelitis : Vaccine. [Enter D.W.S.
P.M. Outlined dilemma – as in brief. If we test, we are bound to have more cases : if
we don’t, we might get v. many more. Middle course wd. be to abridge the tests.
D.W.S. If we do present tests, there will be waiting – and protests – when U.S. vaccinn. is
known to be available. This seems to be unacceptable. I therefore favour some
adjustment. Later informn. suggests greater delay because large batch of U.S.
vaccine is now held up in U.S. for further tests.
Plan for accelerated tests wd mean doing what M.R.C. regard as 2 more important
tests and omitting 3rd. and least important. This wd. be practicable &amp; wd. give
substantial time saving. It wd. be diff. if M.R.C. were unwilling : if they were, we
mght face need to omit all M.R.C. testing.
Risk of Cutter incident is v. small.
Hail. Value of 3rd. test : vid para. 5 of my memo. M.R.C. (para. 9(a)) view is tht. cases
are being caused in U.S. by use of vaccine which hasn’t bn. thro’ last test of
M.R.C.
If we bght. 5.000 litres vice 4.000, we cd. save time.
As a matter of policy, we cd. dispense with all M.R.C. tests. Cd. then cover whole
short-fall. M.R.C. have advised tht. this risk be not taken. Can we disregard that
advice. Last summer, when we decided to use Salk at all, we made great point of
addl. tests. Diff. to go back on that.
In a sense compromise is worse. Half-tested gives undue confidence to public :
delays p’mme : and disregards.
H.B. }Agree with L.P.
D.E. }
K. So do I. M.R.C. view on original import of Salk. Also II(iv) of M.R.C. rpt.
Prefer solution in L.P. memo. para. 6.
P.M. Matter of judgement. If we do full tests, 300 (prs. 600) wh. need not have
occurred. If no tests, prs. 100. (or 500 if Cutter).
K. Don’t disregard risk of wrecking confidence in whole vaccn. policy.
D.W.S. Remember tht. no test can wholly exclude risk.
Hard choice for parent if we don’t test. But if we do full test many parents won’t
even have chance of taking the risk.
H.W. }What of suggn. in para. 16?
H.B. }This seems promising.
D.W-S. 2 injns. give only 70% immunity. In U.S. they insist on 3.
Degree of immunity from 1 wd. be so low tht. this wd. be waste of available
vaccine.
Ch.H Cutter incident cd. result in far more than 400 cases. What wd. be our posn. then
– on revelation of M.R.C. advice? We cdn’t survive it. We really have no choice
but to follow advice of M.R.C.
D.W-S. We must scrutinise advice of experts. And this advice doesn’t stand scrutiny.
Para. 6 of H.’s memo. wdn’t enable us to finish before end/August.
 
 
J.M. Given extent to which Salk is used in U.S., can we not leave choice to parent –
giving them full informn.
M. If you did that, you wd. have also to tell them M.R.C. view.
P.M. What is greater risk : not to be vaccinated at all or to be vaccinated with Salk not
tested in M.R.C.
I.M. Believe M/H. is wrong, tho’ courageous. When we have sought M.R.C. view &amp;
know they wdn’t support this action, we cdn’t risk over-riding it.
D.W.S. If M.R.C. tests were dispensed with, my M.O.’s wd. be ready to advise G.P.’s on
the risk of use.
Agreed : Order 5.000 litres instead of 4.000.
P.M. Do we i) act on M.R.C. advice ; and publish their report in present or amended
form.
ii) dispense with middle course – of abridged tests.
After discn. : Rely on M.R.C. view. Ask them to consider again wtr they cd.
accept any kind of abridgement of tests.
After further discn. v. much worried at this rejection of U.S. remedy in face of our
failure to produce our own.
G.Ll. Can’t we put this back to M.R.C. in some way. So as to reconcile practical need
to use U.S. vaccine and pol. diffy. of acting contrary to M.R.C. advice.
Ch.H. Press M.R.C. on ques why they attach importance to third test wh. failed to
disclose virus.
P.M. To act contrary to view of M.R.C. is not possible.
But we have clear right to X-examine M.R.C. Ask some of them to meet &amp;
discuss with a few Ministers.
[M/H., Ch.H., Hail., M/Edn. to formulate ques.]
Meet on Monday am. Cab. Tuesday.
[Exit D.W-S.
4. Industrial Disputes. Railways.
P.M. Govt. involved – as banker for rlways &amp; authoriser of developmt. plan. Tho’ I
wd. have preferred not to be personally involved.
At mtg. we made it clear to T.U.’s tht. nothg. cd. be done by Govt. in reln. to
current a/c : but we wd. see what part we cd. play in a tripartite effort to increase
rlways’ earning power.
They asked if this meant no rise before ’62. We said no : but must have practical
assurance of progress in sight.
Press got in well in balance. Best line for Govt. is to keep quiet pro. tem. –
adhering to line of communiqué.
Two weeks likely before next confrontation.
 
 
H.A. Timing of mtg. was right. O.K. so far. Time is on our side. This p’mme throws
them out of phase with ’bus strike.
I.M. Agree. Pol. diffy. is tht. some fear we may go further – shd. make it clear that we
won’t.
