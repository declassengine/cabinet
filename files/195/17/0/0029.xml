  <content>C.C.43(58) 15th May, 1958
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.
RAB. Business for next week.
Thursday – Supply – probably debate on Cyprus or aircraft production.
Whitsun Recess : will announce dates as provisional.
Motion referring to Cttee. on Privileges the report of Judicial Cttee. : will consider
wtr to put it down before or after Whitsun.
2. Territorial Waters. [Enter Att. G., Selk.
S.Ll. N.A. Council will discuss tomorrow. F.D. is deprecating use of force. But now
seems likely that Iceland will unilaterally declare 12 miles.
P.M. Alternative courses, as set out in memo.
S.Ll. Diff. to decide dipl. line until known how Iceland proceeds – i.e. wtr they give
notice or put it into force at once. If the latter, course C. can’t be deferred – save
to extent of saying we will do it but are ready to discuss m’while.
D.S. Iceland cd. interfere by sailing thro’ nets.
Att.G. But that is force.
Att.G. If we don’t react firmly, we shall trigger off not only other fishing claims but also
action to establish 12 mile limit for defence.
Hail. Also weaken our legal case, for acquiescence is regarded as acceptance.
Att.G. Their unilateral decln. is likely to be on lines of U.S. proposal at Geneva save that
rights of traditional fishing wd. be only for a period of years.
P.M. To what extent is Course C. practicable? Can trawlers fish there w’out going into
I. ports?
J.H. Think so, in summer. Believe we cd. get them to co-operate and accept discipline
at least for a time viz., keep w’in limits prescribed by R.N. Risk is that after a
time some will break off and go it alone.
P.M. We cdn’t be expected to protect those who go it alone.
Att.G. Protect if you can.
[P.M.] Can addl. ships be provided? Selk. Yes, for a time – at cost of some interference
with training for NATO tasks. If I. were determined, it mght involve casualties or
even sinking of an I. ship.
K. If we say that we are going to enforce our rights under internatl. law, there is some
hope that I. won’t go to extremes.
 
 
S.Ll. What damage can I. do to us? Refuse facilities – both sea and air – for B.
interests.
ALB. We cd. retaliate : they have a civil airline.
P.M. What will U.S. line be? We must tell them what we intend. And use arguments
tht., if we did less, our trawlers wd go and fish and there wd be an incident. I.e.
we can’t avoid the issue.
Instruct repve. in NATO. to warn others we are going to be tough.
F.O. to draft statements related to various possible I. declarations.
Att.G. Also a statement for U.N. on act of aggression if they sought to arrest a Br.
trawler outside existg. limits.
J.H. Cd. M/D. arrange for unarmed Shackleton’s to shadow I. gunboats. Agreed.
Cd. I bring fishing industry into consultn. now?
P.M. Discuss in confidence with Chairman (a General R.M.) various possibilities w’out
indicatg. Govt. decision. Agreed.
J.H. Industry will expect compensn. from H.M.G. if a vessel is sunk.
H.A. No commitment on that. What can they do at Lloyds?
Att.G. On Conference we shd. seek to keep initiative. Memo. to Cabinet.
P.M. Yes. But Take up executive action thro’Hayter’s Cttee. &amp; C.O.S. With O.G. or
A.N. in Chair vice official.
[Exit Selk.
3. Industrial Disputes : Emergency Plans.
R.A.B. All prepns. made which can be done in advance.
No further action until we know what action Unions will take.
I.M. N.U.R. meeting this a.m. 17:5 against offer : even on strike. Danger now is tht.
N.U.R. will keep talking until 23/5 announcemt re c/l. etc.,
H.W. No further offer will be made by R.
[Exit Att.G.
4. Cyprus.
P.M. Statement of new plan revised in light of Ambassadors’ views.
A.L.B. Para 4 VI. All now support fixed period of 7 years.
D.S. Don’t wish to be committed to going on for 7 years, whatever happens. Some
inconsistency betwn. para. 4 VI and 5. We must be free, if nothg. works to
consider other solutions incldg. partition.
Wd.prefer 4 VI to be in terms of “H.M.G. consider that it will be necessary” i.e. to
link it with success of plan.
 
 
P.M. Enough to explain tht. this (4 VI) is inherent in plan : tho’ if it went well, 5 mght
come earlier.
D.S. But what if it went badly?
P.M. 4 VI wdn’t commit us in fact. But we cdn’t say so now – would invite failure.
R.A.B. “Under this plan” – inserted after “operation” – Agreed.
A.L.B. In X. for “have a choice” substitute “exercise authority” – Agreed.
Timing.
A.L.B. Opposn. were critical, in conversn. with Foot. i) They said this wd. seem attempt
to continue B. sovereignty. Suggested it wd. help if NATO endorsed our
retention for 7 years. ii) They wanted future left open : they cdn’t drop support
for s.d. &amp; oppn. to partition. But we can’t abandon our pledge to T. This rules out
(ii). On (i) we mght do something.
S.Ll. H.G. told me he wd. like to help. “Can’t you leave all open after 7 yrs.”
On N.A.T.O. dangerous to invite “endorsement”. But no harm in havg.
discussion in N.A. Council after commn. to G. and T. but before announcement.
We cd. offer that to Opposition.
D.S. Warning re diffy. of m’taining our posn. in C. if this plan fails.
Statement in H/C. Mon. 19/5.
5. France.
S.Ll. Reported latest situation.
6. Lebanon.
S.Ll. After consultn. with F.D., U.S. and we have said tht. if asked we will give
assistance in m’taining internal stability.
D.S. 3 Battns. cd. move fr. Cyprus. C-in-C. authd. to bring them to state of readiness to
extent possible w’out indicatg. use outside C.
S.Ll. Situation may be restored w’out our intervention.
7. Aden.
A.L.B. Our party (with U.S.) have returned.
Govr. feels he has all the powers needed.
P.M. Counter-battery action v. guns in inhabited areas. Can we leave this on basis of
no general authy. – but to be reported to P.M. for decision in each case. (It hasn’t
bn. needed h’to.) Agreed.
