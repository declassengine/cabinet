  <content>C.C.88(58) 23rd December, 1958
1. European Free Trade Area. [Enter E.H : Alport
D.E. (i) We can’t commit ourselves to Six not to discriminate in favour of our friends
outside Europe.
H.A. But we must ascertain views on this of the others in Europe.
(ii) Ellis-Rees to come over for consultn. next week, before mtgs in Paris on 5/1.
Experts will work on this from 5-10 Jan. Ministers meet on 15/1.
D.E. Views of de Gaulle party, as reflected in Le Monde.
R.M. Position is at present obscure : can’t judge how it will develop.
P.M. On our own plan we face dilemma : if our offer is only for 11, we are ourselves
discriminating : if it isn’t, it’s not much help. We must therefore stand on posn.
tht. we can’t say positively tht. its advantages will not be extended to others.
R.A.B. After all the row we’ve had, we can’t afford to make any concession on
agriculture. Prefer to reserve our posn. on that.
2. New Zealand Butter.
Alport. Nash intends to make a helpful statement to follow ours.
Skinner asks only tht. if market changes offl. talks may be resumed.
[Exit Alport
[Enter P.M.G.
3. Civil Service Pay.
H.A. P.O. Engineers have good claim to 4% &amp; wd. get it at arbitration. Remainder had
last increase in July ’57. Normally each wd. go to fact-finding : but this is
working slowly &amp; staff assocns. are reluctant to accept delay. This makes a case
for central award, even tho’ movement has not bn. unusually rapid.
Out-side comparison : 52 firms : in 26 increases amountg to 3.5%. This alone
wdn’t warrant an increase – on philosophy that C.S. follows. But prob. in midmovement
&amp; in 3 mos. or so a case for 3.5% mght be substantiated.
Alternatives. i) no central settlement. The strongest cases wd. go to arbitn. and
might get more than 3.5% – and others, followg., might benefit. And if c/living
rose, awards mght be 5%.
ii) continue with central negotn. but play it slow while more
informn. is being collected. Wdn’t cost less because wd. have to be back-dated.
iii) offer 3.5% now. Against : we shd. not “follow”. For : wd. be
part of present cycle and less likely to start another.
Majority of Cttee. were influenced by consequences of 4% or more in a few
months’ time.
Ch.H. Priestley : comparable outside rates : fact-finding class by class : follow outside
rates. Dangerous to introduce other principles.
Offer of 3.5% not justified on these grounds.
Criticism of arguments in favour.
 
 
Wait for full evidence of outside movement – and accept its consequences.
M. Evidence in para 3 is not representative. Additional – Agreemt. Oct. in
engineering to pay around 4% to salaried staff up to £750. p.a. Above that level
firms make own arrangement usually from 1st. Jan.
If Ty. can settle for 3½%, we shall do well.
H.W. Don’t like offering at this stage a rise to large no. Many wd. see this as start of
fresh round. I wd. sooner take it in detail.
A.L.B. Support M.
I.M. On balance I support H.A. All we can do is to influence timing : &amp; on that basis
the sooner the better. I wd. sooner do it now than in spring or summer of ’59.
PMG. Ch. Hill’s course wd. suit G.P.O. But on balance believe HA is right. P.O.E.’s
will try to get best of two worlds – following outside engineers but also takg.
advantage of any movement in C.S.
At arbitn. P.O.E.’s will get at least 4%.
R.A.B. Settle at 3½% if we can – at this time of year.
Agreed : try for general settlement at 3.5%.
