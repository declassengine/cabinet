  <content>C.C.51(58) 1st July, 1958
1. Visit to France. [Enter E.H.
P.M. Discussion – not negotn.
Fr. determined to develop nuclear potential – gt. diffies. ahead over that. Will
complicate negotns. over suspension of tests. F.O. informing U.S. &amp; Germans.
de G. has become paternal &amp; polite. No longer cassant. Tho’ confident as ever.
No v. clear plan, but gt. faith. Much easier to handle. He said : “When I knew
you before I carried on my shoulders the burden of a dishonoured country”.
Mollet is great strength – will he remain?
de G. doesn’t understand Euro. F.T.A., and doesn’t like it. Have left aide
memoire with him. If he authorises fwd. move, it will be taken.
S.Ll. He will have proposals on NATO commands. But at least sees it as mondiale, not
European.
P.M. 30/9 referendum throughout Fr. Empire on new constitution.
General feeling in France – much calmer. de G. is more dignified and calm than
previous Fr. Ministers.
Couve de M. is in posn. of gt. influence – he can explain things to de G.
2. Atomic Energy : Amendment of U.S. Legislation.
P.M. Amending Bill passed y’day. Draft agreement satisf. – save that at last moment
they have inserted in preamble a reference to co-opn. in civil as well as military
aspects. I told President we cdn’t accept this. President has recommended to
A.E. Commn. (whose decn. is final) that this be omitted.
Time-table means we must initial this to-day. We may have to choose wtr we
abandon this gt. prize because incln. of this reference.
x| We might accept – putting on record our view tht. co-opn. in civil matters wd.
| continue to be handled under civil agreement.
D.S. Reference is unfortunate : but has no legal effect. If they include it, I wd. support
x/.
M. At this stage I wd. accept – subject to x/. In the end believe we shall get more fr.
U.S. than we give.
D.E. They are v. tough over export orders.
RAB. We shd. accept – despite the reference.
P.M. Wd. my letter be published? I wd. feel free to publish if unfavourable comment
here.
S.Ll. Not during the 30 days.
S.Ll. I wd. prefer private record. Congress can still obstruct.
P.M. Get freedom to publish, if need be, after the 30 days. Agreed.
 
 
3. Foreign Affairs.
a) Summit Meeting.
S.Ll. Geneva mtg. of scientists is being held after all. Our reply to K. will be published
today. Somethg. has bn. happening over Poland – Gomulko has bn. obliged to toe
the line.
b) Lebanon.
U.N. are now pussy-footing over this.
Clear that Chamoun can’t command majority. Continuing to look for a prowestern
figure who can.
Renewed disorder – Druses – is plainly internal.
Situation is not improving.
R.A.B. Must review our attitude to U.N. cf. let-down over clearance of Canal.
They will let us down again, for sure.
P.M. May end in “Oriental settlement” – free Lebanon remaining in consequence of all
varying pressures.
A.L.B. Chamoun will retire on 24/7. That will be regarded as defeat.
S.Ll. Retires end/Sept. Elections shd. be on 24/7. But he has said he won’t stand
again.
Hard to “support” a man who himself won’t fight.
P.M. x/ Also risk of its turning into Christian/Moslem dispute.
M’while i) m’tain threat of intervention.
ii) press Sec. Genl. to increase U.N. activity.
iii) hope that i) and ii) will promote x/.
Hail. Any room for good offices commn. to promote x/.
S.Ll. Fr. inclined to favour that – thro’ Ambassadors in Beirut. V. dangerous.
4. Egypt : Financial Negotiations.
H.A. E. unwilling to reach agreemt. on earlier basis. They prefer lump-sum settlement.
Some advantage in this – it wd. dispose sub silentio of war-damage claim &amp; Base.
But figure they have in mind won’t do. They suggest £10 M. but mght. settle at
£25 M. At that level we shd. be open to heavy pressure for supplementy. fr.
Exchequer. E. wd. be willing to say tht. their war-damage claim had bn. treated
as off set by our claim for loss of Base.
We can’t estimate damage to sequestrated. Mght be about £10 M.
Egyptianised. Owners’ claim = £47m. incldg. about £10m. for good will, viz.,
£37 M. net. Our view of true value = £30 M. Total wd. therefore be about £40-
45 m. Settlement at £25m. wd. leave gap of £15-20 m. wh. Exchequer wd. be
expected to close. We therefore really want £35m. – and can’t tell what chance
we have of getting that.
 
 
How slow can it be played? E. have bn. v. dilatory. Cd. delay opening of negotns.
for 2-3 wks. but negotns. themselves wd. last only 10-14 days.
S.Ll. Many advantages in resumg. relns. (trade &amp; diplomatic) : on internatl. side. But on
domestic side, real diffies. : we may be defeated in H/L. on pressure from
claimants to pay them now &amp; recover from E. Diffy. of our taking over : how do
we estimate w’out being in E.?
Claimants are now seeking to interest Oppn. in this.
D.E. Traders are restive. Old level of experts was around £30 M. Now only £3 M.
Importers also want E. cotton because of failure of Sudan crop.
Trading community likely to support claimants.
P.M. i) is it to our advantage to get an agreement – so as to resume relns. in trade &amp;
diplomacy? If so, on terms.
ii) E.’s sterling balance cd. be used to compensate claimants.
[H.A. Opposed, as banker, to that. P.M. Threat, however, to do this
is only card we have to play.]
iii) Failing (ii) must we not make some lump-sum settlement. Ques then is – at
what price? Ask for £45m. and accept £30m?
H.A. S.Ll. both think answer to (i) is – Yes.
A.L.B. But if N. hostility (radio etc.,) is to continue, wd. it help us? Our friends in M/E.
will be confused : I’m telling them tht. E. is our enemy.
S.Ll. They won’t change their attitude. But how deal with our Br. claimants.
A.L.B. Must be hard bargain – genl. relns. being “cool but correct”.
P.M. Not anxious to have v. early settlement.
M. Favour H.A.’s plan qua trade.
H.W. Agree.
A.L.B. V. well –tho’ gt. care in presentn.
P.M. Egyptianised. Mainly large firms. Shd. be content with 70 or 80% of value paid
in U.K. in cash. Sequestrated : smaller men : more likely that Exchequer
supplementn. will be required.
S.Ll. What reply to deputns.?
Hail. Will give suggn. in writing.
P.M. Suggest negotns. be resumed in Rome end/July.
I wd. also like to see draft agreement in full, w’out figures for lump sum.
Play the lump sum v. rate of release of remainder of E. sterling balances.
Keep in touch with Shell – to ensure that our going on won’t prejudice their
negotiation.
 
 
RAB. Colyton wants to wind up Resettlement Board.
P.M. Keep that going. And let’s have report on its work.
5. Suez Canal.
S.Ll. Must state our intentions as soon as Sec. Genl. announces his plan. Propose to do
so in written reply to Question.
6. Commonwealth Immigration.
RAB. No legn. at this time. Permanent legn. on control of aliens wd. also be highly
contentious.
K. Agree. Avoid legn. if we can in remainder of this Parlt.
H. Agree. Hope to reduce immigration from India &amp; Pakistan.
I.M. W. Indians are less trouble here than illiterate Pakistanis.
H.B. Agree. But growing concern.
P.M. Action will have to be taken some day.
