1. Parliament. [Enter A.N., E.H.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
2. Summit Meeting.
P.M. Last 2 R. moves – note to French : publd. : note to U.S., not publd. They are
discrepant. Also mtg. in W’ton with R. Amb. Recd. on Mon. from U.S. summary
of their reply to R. note – wh. was to go to N.A.T.O. (That met last p.m.) I thght
it v. negative : made some suggns. to W’ton : reply W’ton 518. Full text of F.D.’s
conference in Tunis : balanced and leaves much open. NATO mtg. adjourned
until to-morrow. U.S. original line : prepn. proposed are inadequate : para. 3
inaccurate reference to R. “agreement” on unification of G. : can’t agree to
conferences excludg. subjects not desired by R : – whole tone was pretty negative.
My 4 points to U.S. Importance of 2nd. : an agenda with some items below the
line to be taken if time permits. Priority in agenda. This means some discussion
of substance by For. Ministers. U.S. comment on this in W’ton 509.
F.D. will be stiff because he thinks R. want it &amp; may make some concessions to
get it. Hope reply will not appear to close the door. No harm in its re-stating
posn. firmly, if it seems to be step in a stiff negotiation.
H. Awkward if U.S. make it condn. tht. re-unification of G. shd. be among items for
serious discussion. For we might make some progress on disarmament.
R.A.B. Public anxiety points to importce. of holding summit mtg. But I can’t see much
prospect of it’s achieving practical success.
On G., what is our attitude to disengagement? Can we have F.O. study.
On nuclear, are we going for abolition of nuclear tests?
D.S. Spaak thinks F. will have to accept cessation of tests, even if not combined with
cut-off of production.
P.M. My main anxiety is tht. U.S. reply shd. not be such as to enable R. to say that
West don’t want this mtg. V. bad if we were put in posn. of asking R. to reconsider
that posn.
D.S. I wd. prefer to go fwd. on disarmament &amp; nuclear tests rather than disengagement
– wh. seems to me v. dangerous.
I.M. V. dangerous to Tory Party if we don’t have Summit Mtg. Fearful of F.D.’s
attitude.
Hail. Much disturbed by state of public opinion in U.K. Reminiscent of Fulham Bye-
Election, Oxfd. resoln. Peace Pledge Union – all of wh. helped twds. 2nd. world
war. Tory Party then failed to control that movement of opinion. We mustn’t fail
again. F.D. mustn’t make it more diff. for us by ignoring strength of this opinion
in U.K.
H.W. U.K. wd. support P.M.’s readiness to have mtg. on Disarmament alone. Any
chance of getting U.S. to accept that?
 
 
P.M. Curiously, European opinion is not alarmed. U.K. are playing lone hand.
We alone are trying to persuade U.S. to do, for us, somethg. they don’t really
want at all.
H. Agree – get disarmament at top of Agenda.
H.B. Failure of Tory Govts in 1930’s was to put the truth to the public. Have we done
enough to show we have constructive disarmament policy &amp; that left-wing view
on that is impractical.
K. Can we persuade U.S. tht. this mtg. can only be first of several. Avoids pinning
too much hope on one. Also mght make it easier to have first mtg. on
disarmament.
P.M. Para. 7 of W’ton Tel. 510(?)
We &amp; U.S. are not so far apart as F.D.’s Press Conference suggests.
[Exit E.H.
3. Egypt.
H.A. Proposals in memo were put to E. Delegn., who have now referred them to their
Govt.
Summary of proposals.
Settlement on this basis wd. be advantageous to us. Our diffy. will be with
owners of sequestrated property, who will be dissatisfied with E. awards on
damage and will press for further compensation from Exchequer. S’s deputation
will say that their immediate hardship ought to be relieved.
R.A.B. Don’t think we can do better. But will be hard politically to persuade claimants to
go for E. compensn. first, before any ques of Exchequer compensn. is entertained.
We must distinguish betwn. the two v. clearly.
Hail. Have played that line. But S. says a moral principle is involved because Suez was
act of U.K. Govt. policy &amp; Govt. shd. therefore compensate claimants 100%.
P.M. Must present this as a deal. E. get £17 M. net of their own money.
We get £30 M. to meet claims on nationalised property – &amp; we believe that is
more than enough : &amp; also there is neutral arbitration. Shell is out of it. Thus, it’s
v. nearly compensn. in full for the nationalised property.
On sequestrated – E. offer to return it can’t be bettered. Damage will in addn. be
compensated : must make it clear that damage is only for damage done after
sequestration. On transfer across exchanges – £5.000 in each case is pretty good,
&amp; will meet most small cases.
Hail. Endorse proposals in memo. But in due course believe we shall have to pay, prs.
more than we need, in compensation. Agree that is a later stage : but H/L. will
press for speed in reaching it.
P.M. A good bargain : to our long-term interest as trading nation : not likely to redound
to E. credit in Arab world – N. can’t represent it to them as triumph. Finally, on
claim for war-damage/base : N. can’t go to Int. Court.
