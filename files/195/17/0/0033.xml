  <content>C.C.49(58) 24th June, 1958
1. Lebanon. [Enter E.H.
S.Ll. Sec. Genl. U.N. seems to have made up his mind v. U.N. force : tho’ ready to
strengthen observers. Visit to Nasser : ? compromise.
Sitn. is not being cleared : no sufft. control over Army.
Election of new President 24(=25) July.
P.M. Sitn. bad : but changed. Our line shd. now be to force action by U.N. Sec. Genl.
is failing to carry out resoln. – “ensure”. Force U.N. to do its duty. Or prove it’s
useless to check thieves &amp; murderers. Then we may have to seek some other
shield. Force that issue.
D.S. P.Q.’s on re-inforcement of Cyprus.
H. I said in H/L. this was nothg. to do with Lebanon.
P.M. Troops in Cyprus – 2 functions : reserve for M/E. and internal security. Because
order disturbed, had to send extra troops to enable both roles to continue to be
m’tained.
2. Cyprus.
S.Ll. Concentrate now on persuading Cypriots. Thank NATO : hope their Govts. will
go on giving counsel to G. &amp; T. Don’t use NATO as intermediary – prs. its Sec.
Genl. For the present, good offices only are needed.
3. Pensions. [Enter B.C.
P.M. Work done has simplified problem. Must now (or next wk) decide betwn courses
of action. a) Can we agree betwn. Aug. &amp; Sept.? This wd. be best course. Won’t
be much easier by delay. b) Do nothing. But emerging deficits wd. then hamper
next years’ Budget. c) Throw it open to general discussion by public &amp; take
decision in light of re-action.
a) Choice between the two plans. Outlined main features.
H.A. Exchequer. Either scheme wd. give immediate relief. But Aug. is preferable and
cd. be put into opn. more easily &amp; quickly. We wd. limit action to pension needed
for basic needs – £15 earnings : 85/= pension at 65 : tho’ these amounts are
debateable, the principle is right. Also, sounder financially : relies only on
expectn. tht. wages will continue to increase in real terms and provides safeguard
v. that. Sept. is not sound. Relies on i) 5-year review of basic section – help to
Exchequer if contns. then increased. ii) Suppl. scheme wd. produce surplus
income in early years : but in 4 or 5 years total scheme wd. again run into deficit.
It wd. be obvious tht. all you were doing, financially, was to pinch income fr.
suppl. scheme to redress overall deficit.
Under Aug. benefit matures earlier : and lower-paid get extra help.
Moreover, Aug. is less competitive with Crossman. Doesn’t go beyond basic
needs. Dangerous for State to go beyond basic needs. Much prefer to stand w’in
those limits. No contracting-out. Its pol. appeal has bn. exaggerated.
 
 
B.C. Finance. Either plan is better than doing nothing. If comparison is made in
respect of charge on votes, Sept. does as well up to 1980 &amp; it isn’t until 2000 tht.
balance turns in favour of August.
We shd. also take a/c of redn. of savings because of people dropping private
schemes. My concln. on this : we shd. consider schemes on merits – finance
apart.
Consultation. Repve. bodies (both sides) and natd. indies. favour principle of
contracting-out. Private employers are divided. But treating this as sample, nos.
contractg-out wd. be less than the ⅓rd. we have assumed. Not therefore the
overwhelmg. demand for it wh. wd. have wrecked finances of Sept. plan. Also, I
have consulted officers of Party Cttee. &amp; Progress Trust – and they favour
contracting-out.
Argument (para. 19) tht. contractg-out is impracticable is not now open to us.
Implication tht. Sept. goes beyond basic needs. Both schemes are limited to
earnings of £15.
Self-employed : Sept. wd. leave them out : Aug., by bringing them in, wd. impose
heavy burden since no graduated contn. from an employer.
Thus, I still prefer Sept. It was a compromise. I originally preferred a scheme
operatg. wholly in private sector : &amp; I adopted this in order to give some contribn.
twds. deficit under present scheme.
Consultn. shows tht. Aug. wd. cut into private schemes.
Comparison. Contractg-out wdn’t work with Crossman. Labour wd. have to drop
it. We cdn’t criticise them for that if we had dropped it ourselves.
I.M. Finance. Sept. is rather better up to 1980. We can therefore ignore this &amp;
concentrate on social aspects.
“Basic needs”. State shd. not interfere if private employer is providing. Aug.
does so interfere.
Feeling betwn “2 nations” wd. be better eased by Sept.
Pol. and real advantage lies with Sept.
Hail Consultns. &amp; Press have revealed tht. no public opinion on either plan. It is thght
we are buying votes. It is not understood that action is needed to meet deficit.
Thus, no support for any action. We must therefore have a W. Paper. My inclinn.
is twds. Aug. plan because I think Party line shd. be tht. State shd. not go beyond
“safety net” or basic need. If contractg-out is acceptable to Party, it is because
Sept. plan is not a Tory plan because it takes State action too far. Real Tory line
shd. be tht. State shd. not enter that field at all. Sept. plan puts State into area
where private enterprise is doing a good job. Aug. merely extrudes them from
area wh. is now defined as basic need.
Must by W.Paper educate Party to need for some scheme. It shd., if possible,
favour one solution. And I favour August.
M. Aug. does favour Ty. But effect on private schemes wd. be bad – wd. at least
prevent their expansion. As no contractg-out, future Govt. wd. yield to pressure
for increased benefit – and then, as too late for contractg out, private schemes wd.
perish.
P.M. Dislike both schemes.
Argument tht. State shd. limit itself to basic need goes v. Aug. (Because
graduated) as well as Sept.
On balance, if we must act, I wd. go for Sept.
 
 
H.B. Action needed because of emerging deficit. What will be effect of each scheme
on that? There seems to be no agreement on this. Can we have more agreed
informn. on that point?
H.A. Only diffce. betwn. me &amp; M/P. on these pp. is wtr we spk. in terms only of contns.
B.C. But after 1980 large diffies. because difft. assumptions.
A.L.B. Preserve contracting-out. Both schemes cut into field h’to thght appropte. for
private enterprise. Thus, favour September.
Hail. Have you realised how much it will cost to contract out.
Ch.H. Apart fr. contractg-out, I wd. favour Aug. But can we put fwd. any scheme wh.
doesn’t provide for contractg-out. Doubt if it will be widely used for most private
plans were brght in to hold labour &amp; won’t be kept going under transferability.
K. My bias was in favour of contractg-out. But look at difficulties – a) H.A. says it’s
impracticable. We must decide wtr it is, or not.
Can’t rule that out, as B.C. says, because we have put it to employers etc.,
H.A. Not impossible : but v. difficult because of followg. changes of emplt.
P.M. Wd. turn to some extent on nature of industries wh. do contract out.
K. a) we need further informn. on practicability.
b) Presentational diffy. of point in para. 9 of H.A.’s memo. How cd. a Ch/Ex. put
that – w’out damage to fin. policy.
c) Positive aspect of same point – in para. 10.
d) Both plans cut into private enterprise. Hail. believes it can compete even v.
this incursion.
On balance of argument in pp., I find it hard to sustain my preference for
contractg-out.
D.E. Danger of Aug. plan is tht. it gives platform on wh. a Labour Govt. cd. easily
build. Rates cd. be raised : contractg-out already dropped.
R.A.B. Finance. Pp. assume Sept. will run on 3%. It won’t. Must be 4%.
Hail. D.E.’s pol. argument rests on assumptn. tht. we lose next Election.
S.Ll. Neither.
H. Sept. or neither.
D.E. Neither.
J.H. i) Contractg.-out : companies prefer Aug.
ii) If we act, we do so only for financial reasons. Hard therefore to reject Ty.
plan.
RAB. Next Budget can’t be what we want unless Ty. can, or can appear to be able to,
cater for emerging deficit.
If we leave this to Election, there will be a Dutch auction – which we shall lose.
 
 
If it were not for these points, I wd. sooner do nothing.
Contracting-out. We need more informn. But remember what Unilever said.
No doubt tht. Aug. is sounder. If we take Sept, we shall do so on pol. grds. – and
we shall prob. have to adjust it.
Wd. a scheme at 4% with contractg-out limited to 3-4 m., be financially tolerable.
I.M. Can we see what legn. wd. be needed to abate other schemes under Aug. plan.
Hail. You wd. need legn. for these under Sept. plan.
P.M. Let us have another discussion. See what other informn. we can have. We ought
to go for one scheme or the other, if we can. We shd. also try to get people to
understand real reason for reform : viz., need to prevent existg. scheme from
going bankrupt.
[Exit B.C.
4. Education : Salaries of Scottish Teachers.
P.M. Shd. we not make our posn. clear?
J.M. No Minister has ever made advance approach to the parties or one of them. But I
have to write to them on state of the fund.
P.M. Cd. HA. with 2 Educn. Ministers with I.M. discuss this?
H.A. Have done so. I recommend tht., despite this tradition, J.M. shd. warn them that
he can’t consider another increase before end of three years.
J.M. Is it certain we shdn’t agree to any increase?
G.Ll. Omit para. 4.
J.M. V. well.
Agreed : despatch lr. as in draft less para 4.
