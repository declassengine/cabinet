Note not taken.
2. Broadcasting : Queen’s Christmas Message. [Enter P.M.G.
R.A.B. Put dilemma.
CLOSED UNDER THE
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT 2000
B.B.C. alone can transmit to Doms. (sound). Technical ground – apart from
prestige.
H. Analogy of Party Political B’casts – where B.B.C. take, tho’ both carry p’mme.
Ch.H. Xmas p’mme, historically, was world-wide sound : that is good reason for
limiting that to B.B.C. Avoid decision of principle on all such occasions. Leave
over until next year ques wtr I.T.A. comes into television of Opening of Parlt.
P.M.G. I.T.A. won’t press it v. strongly – Xmas b’cast recognised as B.B.C. invention.
Will fight the principle on other occasions.
Agreed : restrict this b’cast to B.B.C.
[Exit E.M.

Will M/D. submit memo. (to Cabinet) on ques wtr any legn. on this cd. be left
over to next Parliament.
S.Ll. Hope memo. will include facts on wh. D.S. based his B’pool statement.
D.S. Will submit to Cab. If they are not satisfied, Cttee. can review it.
J.H. Some decision will have to be taken in spring ’59.
I.M. There will be some controversy over limited Bill – accentuates diffce. betwn. man
who is just in N.S. and the one who isn’t.
 
 
R.A.B. Cttee. to consider also C.D. bounty.
[Exit C.S.
