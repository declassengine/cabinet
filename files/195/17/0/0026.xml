Industrial Disputes – Railways. [Enter E.H.
I.M. Report of Friday’s mtg. circulated.
We know tht. c/l. index will go up by 2 points, to 110 on 23rd. May. Viz., after
strike notice but before strike.
Decn. to strike has bn. taken by N.U.R. Held by invitn. to M/Labour : but not
rescinded. New sitn. will need to be created if it is to be changed.
My concln. after Friday : unless we cd. devise some package deal with July date,
strike inevitable – to begin soon after Whitsun. Can’t play it out much longer.
Miners’ claim. Morris L.J. will give award at end/month. He will be influenced
by rlway settlement – but also by c/l. increase.
H.W. Have bn. seeking economies addl. to £10 M. Can raise that to £12½ M. by honest
&amp; defensible means. This will come in, additional, over 12 mos.
R. remains firm tht. he can’t begin to pay until Sept. if he is to wait until money is
coming in.
P.M. Have seen R. He agrees £12½ M. genuine over 12 mos. from October. That wd.
warrant 4% wage increase – for full year. £10 M. wd. be rather more than 3%.
I.M. Believe we can settle for 3% from July.
P.M. R. thinks he will have to offer 4%. He proposes 3% from July rising to 4% in
October. The first 3 months wd. anticipate earnings. He prefers a final 4% to
avoid fresh claims.
He wd. begin with offer of 4% from Oct. with retrospective paymts. fr. July on
basis of 3%. He wd. then go to 3% fr. July and 4% fr. October.
He also wants to base this on arbitn. report – regret tht. rlway wages are below
others : have sought therefore to increase earnings of rlways : make the offer.
Wishes me to see the T.U.’s &amp; tell them no more can be paid than is saved by
these means. Also promise enquiry into wage structure : will take 12 mos : will
involve increased cost : but is overdue. Wd. help to lift it out of c/living “rounds”.
Worst course wd. be to have it all again in autumn. If we settle, we want
somethg. which will stick.
I.M. Worried by 4% suggn. This will set pattern for the year for other industries.
Had envisaged £12½ M. as means of paying 3% from July, not as justification for
4%.
H.W. R. wd. be content with limit of 3%.
ALB. Will economies be realised?
P.M. If they aren’t, it’s more likely to be because of H/C. than because of B.T.C. or
men.
H.A. Can assent to 3% on basis of £12½ M. – but not to more.
Also reaction of 4% on other industries.
 
 
I.M. I agree. In 1957 we erred in raising rlway from 3% to 5% : we thus set pattern for
1957. We shall be raising them now from 0 to 3%. Don’t set a pattern for 1958
of 4%.
Sure M/P. wd. endorse this qua effect on engineering etc.,
H.W. Favour enquiry into structure. Wd. give peace for 12-18 months.
H. May weaken posn. politically. Will be seen to involve more cash.
A.L.B. No : Party view is that cake is not properly divided.
H.B. Fear this – as sign of weakness.
R.M. Broaden it to efficiency?
H.W. Will cover numbers, as well as wage structure.
P.M. Mght help men to accept 3% : mght be difficult to get Party to accept.
E.H. Will be hard enough to sell “3% in July” to the Party – in H/C. and in country.
They are sceptical about possibility of economies.
P.M. Economies are £12½ M. on top of £15 M. designed to keep his deficit w’in £61M.
Hail. Agree this settlement will be hard to justify to Party. But can we get public
opinion as a whole to support us in a strike. On balance therefore I support M/L.
H.W. R. thinks chance of settlement will be increased if he offers enquiry at same time.
J.M. Any settlement will be taken as “victory” for T.U.’s. But, contrariwise if there is
strike, public won’t understand why.
H.B. Shall we next be asked to weaken on bus-strike?
I.M. No.
RAB. There will be other strikes too. In particular, oil tankers : docks (lightermen).
P.M. We have tried to check inflation. Device of limiting money supply was mine, not
P.T.’s. I never regarded it as doctrine : only to create a climate. We don’t breach
that policy if award is not such that all other industries are undermined. Obvious
tactics are not to invite all comers, but to leave strikers in isolation so far as
possible. Settle rlways therefore and isolate Cousins.
Agreed (2) better not to publish enquiry on structure at same
time. If need be, R. can mention it.
I.M. If he needs this card to get a settlement, shdn’t he play it.
P.M. Too dangerous because of feeling in Party. Agreed : play it if need be.
(1) Authorise R. to offer 3% from July.
