Middle East. [Enter 3 Serv. Min, M/S., Att.G. E.H.
P.M. Read his messages to President E. Tels. 4477 and 4478 to W’ton. Message (2 a.m.)
from Adml. Holloway. Assault 1 – p.m. G.M.T. to-day.
U.S. intentions in S. Council – Ottawa 746 – to ask U.N. Force to take over from
them.
Hard to know how sitn. will develop – and what U.S. intentions are.
S.Ll. Bagdad has announced Nuri has escaped. B. Embassy : one casualty only. 2 U.S.
citizens believed killed. Air Force seems to be with rebels. No animosity to
foreigners – tho’ this may develop as result of intervention in Lebanon.
We are alerting Rulers in Gulf – to beware of sabotage.
We are concerting arrangemts. with U.S. to protect lives &amp; property in Lebanon.
C.O.S. are moving ships to stand off Tripoli.
P.M. Jordan. Request for intervention “if this shd. prove necessary to preserve
integrity &amp; independence of Jordan – against any external threat, wtr from Iraq,
Syria or Egypt.”
What is our legal posn.?
S.Ll. Considerable evidence of supply of arms &amp; conspiracy v. King’s life.
Att.G. Art. 51 : collective self-defence. Any assistance to a member concerned in
legitimate self-defence is covered – not only aid given under a system or treaty of
collective security. We shd. therefore be w’in our rights in giving aid on request.
K. And aggression includes internal insurrection externally inspired.
P.M. Stronger case here than in Lebanon where Sec. Genl. has blown on the ‘evidence’
of external interference.
Att.G. Difficulty arises, not on despatch of troops, but on their use.
R.A.B. We are in danger of being left out – not seen to be doing anything to remedy our
loss of prestige.
If we went in to Jordan, we shd. have solid bridgehead – with U.S. in Lebanon.
S.Ll. We shall send to F.D. this morning reasoned case for intervention in Jordan. We
shall also ask Hussein what help he wd. want &amp; where &amp; logistics.
Have asked Israel for sympathetic attitude to over-flying en route to Jordan.
P.M. We shall know soon what Arab re-action is to U.S. intervention in Jordan.
C.S. Diffies. of U.S. intervention in J. : no l. of c. or supply.
Iraq. What can we do to protect Br. lives &amp; interests in Iraq?
S.Ll. We shall be pressed here to get a strong-point at Habbaniyah.
P.M. Impracticable to seize it by airborne landing.
 
 
D.S. Can’t assume it to be friendly. Monitoring of our messages etc.,
Jordan (resumed).
P.M. Att.G. to consider legal basis on which King H.’s appeal shd. be founded.
D.S. Wd. prefer to be invited in before disorder begins.
Iraq (resumed).
S.Ll. Shall we say to Cttee. (rebels) that we hold them responsible for damage to Br.
lives &amp; property. Wd. it involve admission of their victory?
P.M. Say in H/C. that we shall hold them responsible. Consider wtr we sent message to
Cttee. e.g. thro’ Italians.
