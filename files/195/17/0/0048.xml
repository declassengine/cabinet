  <content>C.C.67(58) 12th August, 1958
1. Middle East. [Enter O-G., Perth, H.Millar
P.M. Objective at U.N. : power to Sec. Genl. to operate in U.N. manner in J. &amp; L.
O.G. To ensure tht. indepce. &amp; integrity of J. wd. be secured after we w’drew. U.N.
supervision, not only over border, but over such interference in p’ganda. S. Genl.’s
interest : to prevent break up of J. leading to Arab/Israel war.
P.M. We must await outcome of U.N. discns.
H.M. Risk tht. U.S. may be content to leave L. to Chehab w’out any U.N. help.
P. U.N. observers on Yemen/Aden borders. Have resisted this h’to – lest Rulers
mght think this weakness on our part. May have to give way, in wider interest. If
so, want to prepare Rulers for it.
O.G. Not an immediate issue. U.N. will have work cut out to do it in Jordan.
P. Even so, wd. like to inform acting Govr.
O.G. No harm in that – say that, if this principle is accepted for J. &amp; L., it wdn’t be
possible to deny it for Yemen/Aden at some later stage.
2. New Zealand : Trade Talks.
D.E. Negotiations last year ended with decn. to re-open in Apl. ’58 whole ques of Imp.
preference etc., Skinner came over for that purpose. They asked for redn. of
preference margins : we made counter-offers wh. they accepted – but whole
change agreed was in favour of N.Z.
We asked in return for i) no discrimn. v. U.K. in tariffs – they assented. ii) tht.
they wdn’t use quotas in discriminatory or harmful way to U.K. trade. – they
refused, on grd. of labour preference for bi-lateral agreemts vice multilateral
system. They have made such an agreemt. with Austr. : now they want one with
Japan. Havg. declined to give us that assurance, they say they want to denounce
Ottawa Agreemt.
This is turning point in Commonw. econ. policy. Move twds bi-lateralism, if we
can’t check it, may impair seriously prospects of multilateral trade world-wide.
Nash, with majority of 2, has no call on our support. I wd. sooner see them
denounce Ottawa : we wd. have a strong case vis-a-vis our supporters. But I see
tht. such a reply wd. be risky at Montreal. Hence revised draft reply to Nash,
suggestg. discn. at Montreal.
H. Agree we shall have to face them on this. But I wd. sooner p’pone that until after
Montreal.
P.M. Tariffs. We have agreed to reductions – 17½% to 10% &amp; some by more.
Quotas. His proposed action inconsistent with Ottawa &amp; on that a/c he wants to
give notice to terminate them. That wd. be a blow here.
H.A. But to accept it wd. be v. bad for our trade.
 
 
Agree denounciation wd. give us diffies. here – where sympathy is with N.Z.
Favour suggn. of another Ministerial mtg. Play it long.
J.H. If they are going to do this, we must prepare our p. opinion for it.
H. Must try to get him past Montreal.
H.A. We have a good case, but shan’t be able to get across.
P.M. Wd. sooner make a strong personal appeal to wait for Montreal. Set out what we
have done over tariffs [and butter] &amp; take credit for it.
Quotas : make the argument tht. you can’t get new trade by this means w’out
cutting into ours.
Surely we can hope to come to some agreemt. at Montreal wh. will enable us to
preserve framework of Ottawa.
Make it suitable for publn., if necessary, &amp; warn him of this.
Put all polemical arguments, in support, thro’ H.Commr.
J.H. Put butter into message itself.
P.M. Yes.
H. * If he can’t wait for Montreal, offer to send a Minister there beforehand.
Agreed.
3. Egypt : Financial Negotiations.
K. Doubtful wtr we will ever get better terms. Prize it holds is recovery of
sequestrated – £171.5 M out of total claim of £210 M. And no hope of getting
back that £171.5 M. w’out an agreement. [This figure includes £44 M. for Shell.]
Against that, pol. difficulties. Sum is below real value and far below claimed
value. Also wd. be assumed we had given them somethg. substantial for war
damage and/or thrown away the Base.
But indications tht. E.Govt. don’t want a settlement now. Therefore, if we
accepted £20.5 or made a compromise offer, we shd. be worse off when
negotiations had to be resumed.
Finally, time is not on our side.
H.A. Want to get this out of the way. But unwise to press it while Nasser is in mood
x | not to make an agreemt. Hope there may be a chance to resume in 4-6 weeks.
P.M. Accept this recommn. on basis of x/.
y | But why not start in 2 wks. or so to reach agreement on all terms of settlement
| save the figures.
Our over-riding interest is to recover sequestrated assets and resume trade.
If we can proceed as at y/, we shd. then be in posn. to finish it off at short notice
whenever E. are ready to settle a figure.
Agreed: Wait for a few weeks – certainly until after Assembly.
Study y : and wtr we can give away on the small points
outstanding.
Resolve that, if agreemt. can be obtained even at £20.5 m., it
 
 
would suit us to have it.
4. Dr. Alan Nunn May.
O.G. As in brief.
Hail. V. dangerous.
P.M. But he won’t come back.
U.S. re-actions. Not before Congress rises. Need we do it at all.
Agreed: { reject application for ppt., at any rate this year
{ let him apply again in the Spring.
5. Cyprus.
P.M. Discussions in Athens &amp; Ankara. Greeks don’t like the plan – tho’ ready to
support cessation of violence, 7 year pause and during it some progress twds. selfgovt.
They dislike concept of partnership – because hatred of T. is a mainspring
of their lives. But what they won’t have is a plan wh. admits long-term T. interest
in Island &amp; share in its govt. – and because of tolerance of T. presence durg. 7
year will prejudice final solution in favour of Enosis. Despite this, they did
discuss plan in detail. They put 4 objns.
i) Executive Council : shd. be more than 4:2 majority. That wd.
make no practical difference : majority is enough.
ii) only forum for people as a whole is in Council – not elected.
iii) dual nationality.
iv) repves. of T. &amp; G. associated with Govr.
They won’t press i) or iii) v. hard. On ii) they cd. have offer of popularly-elected
assembly at some stage. On iv ) they will press objn. esp., to membership of
Council.
I made it clear tht. I was not negotiating for their agreement. Ready to go on, in
hope of their acquiescence. Gk. Govt. weak – frightened of Makarios &amp; of
Communism. They won’t therefore support the plan. They will miss yet another
’bus. They haven’t political strength to do anything. They made desperate plea
tht. we shd. amend plan to meet their view. They also asked us to go back on
A.L.B. declaration.
Ankara. Told them Gk. comment. They said strongly whole plan and nothing but
the plan : no amendment of any kind. They pretended we were bound by it. With
any amendment made they might slip out and oppose it altogether. Tho’ they
produced amendments for partition, base and all! But they do accept plan as it
stands.
Procedure now. Useless to seek agreemt. Can only go forward &amp; hope they will
both come along.
Three courses : i) say no prospect of agreement : drop it : carry on &amp; govern
Island.
ii) say we propose to carry out plan w’out amendmt. T. wd. cooperate.
But no concession to Gk., NATO or U.N. Wd.
seem v. rigid.
iii) To make some adjustments in hope tht. it wd. reduce Gk.
opposition w’out losing T.altogether.
 
 
All have risks. On (i) both G. &amp; T. wd. m’tain extreme attitudes. We shd. lose
agreemt. gained on peace + 7 year lull. I reject that course – no advantage to us,
politically or in adminn.
On (ii) full T. co-opern. But bitter Gk. opposn. And
internationally shd. be regarded as inflexible.
On (iii) we shd. have good international posn. But changes shd.
seem to be reasonable on merits &amp; not made solely to meet Gk. objns. Cd. also
include pro. T. change. Separate municipal authies. wh. we can’t in any event
stop.
I prefer course (iii). That is advocated in Tels. 1170 – 1172 from Cyprus. Replies
620 Athens and 1284 Ankara give comments of our Ambassadors.
The great issue is whether we take the certainty of (ii) or risk gamble of (iii).
Fear Allen is over-optimistic. Gks. more likely to re-act strongly.
In either event there will be a period of more intense violence in C.
P. Believe A.L.B. wd. favour course (iii).
Course (ii) wd. be v. run of the debates in H/C. – in which ALB took a flexible
line, as did P.M.
Course (iii) will help us with Labour in U.K. &amp; international opinions as
expressed.
Diffies. : drafts give us no “out” if troubles in Island or non-co-operation make it
impossible for us to carry out our plan.
O-G. S.Ll. favours (iii).
H. I think gamble is worth trying.
H.A. Results of P.M.’s mission are better than expected.
H. Dual nationality. Shd. we drop it. Gks work it administratively. T. don’t want it.
P.M. Prefer to leave it in abeyance.
General feeling : clearly in favour of (iii).
P.M. Procedure. Time for argument is over. More will make it worse. Propose
therefore to write &amp; announce almost at once. Otherwise Gks. will leak.
