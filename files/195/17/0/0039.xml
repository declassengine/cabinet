(7.30 p.m.)
Middle East. [Enter E.H.
S.Ll. Reported main facts – incldg Shamoun’s appeal and U.S. disposition to meet it.
P.M. Mtg. of Def. Cttee. held. Authorised precautionary moves to enable us to act in
the Gulf, if necessary. Unlikely to excite gt. interest because cd. be justified by
sitn. in Aden.
Discussed genl. sitn. Assumed at outset that we were faced with
revolutionary Govt. Later informn. suggest fighting continues &amp; issue not finally
determined. Situation grave but still uncertain.
Iraq. 800 or more R.A.F. at Habbaniyah. May get appeal from Jordan
(King has proclaimed himself King of Arab Union) for help.
Must look at situation as a whole. Wrong to intervene in Lebanon viewing it
alone : or to encourage U.S. to do so. We face larger problem of M/E. as a whole.
Owing to Suez and what followed – we have Arab nationalism in spate,
manipulated by Nasser. Mght lead to federation of Arab world under N.’s
leadership. Difficult then for us to hold posns. in Gulf. This wd. give them some
advantages to wh. they have a claim : we wd. have to live with it and
accommodate ourselves to it. Br. &amp; Western influence wd. disappear – and
N.Africa, Somalia etc., mght come into same orbit.
Therefore, in our reply to U.S., we shd. not speak of Lebanon per se. Is this an
opportunity to check N. and clean up situation in M/E. generally.
This (Iraq) is plainly a conspiracy because early announcemts in Beirut and Cairo.
Say therefore to U.S. if you really mean to see this thro’, we will go along with
you. But not qua Lebanon alone.
Say also we wd. like to have token force in Lebanon expedition – for we shd.
want U.S. contribn. to any intervention of ours in Iraq or Jordan.
R.A.B. Can’t press U.S. not to act – in face of sitn. in Iraq – because of vital importce. of
securing U.S. interest in M/E.
Subject to caution on announcement &amp; reportg. to S. Council, we shd. support
their intention to intervene. Wd. like a token Br. contingent to show it as Anglo-
U.S. initiative.
Arab nationalism. Shd. have preferred to find basis of friendship. But can’t let it
slip away.
Favour Br. intervention – either in Iraq or Jordan. Can’t yet decide which it shd.
be.
H. Failed in past to look far enough ahead &amp; define our objectives. Can’t afford to
occupy any of these countries. Most we can hope to do is to sustain friendly
Govts. for short period of years.
Possible limited objectives : seal Leb/Syrian frontier : preserve Jordan’s
independence. If U.S. do first, we cd. do second. But do both at once. Angle for
invitation fr. Jordan. Approve U.S. intentn. Respectable first aims.
H.A. No confidence in “friendly” Arab Govts. or their régimes.
We must not move save on Anglo-U.S. basis.
Grim prospect to back policy based on opposn. to Arab nationalism.
Hard to intervene, even on request, to help suppress internal insurrection.
x| If U.S. go into Lebanon, it won’t stop there : increases chances of our having to
intervene in Iraq/Jordan.
 
 
But always thght best hope for M/E.was to secure U.S. interest. Hard therefore to
ride them off now.
We shd. warn U.S. of x/. Can’t see what ultimate consequences mght be. Can we
see our way through to a long-term objective?
D.E. Have thght for long we shdn’t hold M/E. with oil revenues going to a limited no.
of States &amp; not benefiting a middle-class society. If we can’t kill N., how check
spread of Arab nationalism.
But if U.S. want to intervene, we must support them.
Importance of saving India. U.S./U.K. financial support.
A.L.B. E. is not natural leader of Arab opinion. Disliked in many Arab countries
(leaders). If we wait until there is external aggression everything will go
We cdn’t discourage U.S. Don’t be too gloomy with them over where it all leads.
But agree there ought to be some action elsewhere.
D.S. Danger of Arab empire under N. Suez mght have nipped all this in bud. Lebanon
Now Iraq. If no action taken, Jordan will soon go. And Gulf may be threatened.
Then S. Arabia &amp; N. Africa.
Here is chance to make a stand, jointly with U.S. Not only Lebanon – much
wider issue – we shd. make that clear to U.S.
Legality is of gt. importance. Lebanon : action at invitation of existg. Govt. Arab
Union : King of Jordan cd. similarly invite us both.
If any mil. action, quicker the better.
Importance of Habbaniyah. If local Iraq garrison still friendly, we cd get in &amp;
make it a rallying point for loyal forces – and point of entry or exit for the West.
800 R.A.F. personnel .
Wd. wish token Br. contn. in Lebanon, to secure U.S. co-opn. in any operation of
ours in Iraq or Jordan.
S.Ll. Jordan has now asked what we are going to do.
R.M. This gives us opportunity to get him to ask us to act in his defence.
K. i) Legal posn. must be clear. Don’t think it’s enough to be asked in if it’s
internal insurrection. In Lebanon, we must be able to show that it’s new form
of aggression – insurrection fomented by external agents. Gaitskell is saying
it’s purely internal politics.
ii) Where do we go next? In Jordan we must equally be able to say that
operations or threat are inspired by N.
Suez lesson is that we must have a continuing basis for intervention. Protection
of Br. nationals may not suffice.
Hail. Doing nothg. may be no less dangerous. Can’t see ultimate result of either
course.
Can’t decline to support U.S. intervention. Not much advantage in having token
Br. force with them. We may need all our forces for Iraq/Jordan.
H. Hard to hold India &amp; Ceylon in Commonwealth if we can’t get legal position
clearly established.
J.H. Large-scale operation. Have we resources for it?
 
 
H.B. Much more than a gesture. Will be major operation &amp; we must be sure U.S. have
will to go thro’ with it to the end.
S.Ll. If we don’t intervene, Arabs wd. unite v. us &amp; deny the oil. My belief is that we
shd. answer all U.S. ques in affirmative.
Read draft tel. to U.S.
P.M. Must put it on a wider basis.
S.Ll. Read tel. fr. W’ton. Clear now that suggns. of our not joining in Lebanese
intervention is made solely to leave us free to act in Iraq &amp; Jordan. Arguments
pro &amp; con. a Br. token contribn.
P.M. Good U.N. case for intervention in Lebanon to seal Syrian frontier. But this is not
worth doing per se. There is Iraq/Jordan too. And all must be on an Anglo-U.S.
basis, even tho’ we share out the tasks.
H. Consult with Opposition?
E.H. May lose some waverers in our own Party.
