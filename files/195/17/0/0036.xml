  <content>C.C.52(58) 3rd July 1958
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
2. Parliament : Privilege.
R.A.B. Much oppn. to report on both sides of the H/C.
But among members of Cttee. feeling tht. report shd. be approved or disapproved
by H/C.
I cannot take the line tht. we are concerned only with the new recommendn.
I must deploy the arguments pro. &amp; con. the original Rpt. I spk. as Chairman of
the Cttee. – tho’ Att. G. will spk. against it. Most members of Cttee. as now
constituted will be against it. Makes my posn. awkward.
Hail. Report as it stands wd. enrage whole of legal profession.
R.A.B. Will you allow a free vote? I think you must. I shall probably abstain. Official
Labour Oppn. will vote for the report.
Hail. Our political interest is to oppose the report.
The courts wd. give the protn. of qualified privilege. Parlt. shd. ask for no more.
The report seeks to protect malice.
K. But hard to require M.P. to defend himself on that basis in the courts.
P.M. Let many Ministers abstain, and a few vote against.
R.A.B. My preference wd. be for remitting whole ques of letters to M.P.’s to a Select
Cttee. with a suitable Chairman.
K. Good idea. Cd. you inspire an amendment accordingly?
Hail. Same ques arises for Peers : that wd. be a reason for not putting it back to Cttee. of
Privileges.
R.A.B. Don’t want a Joint Sel. Cttee.
3. Atomic Energy Act. U.S. Legislation.
P.M. A.E.C. has agreed to omit disputed passage from preamble. Hood has initialled it.
Will be signed to-day.
S.Ll. Various amendments : can’t promise a White Paper before Monday.
P.M. Shall not make statement in H/C. Will suffice to put it out to Press.
S.Ll. Can’t now get the 30 sitting days unless Congress sits until end/August.
 
 
4. Egypt : Financial Negotiations.
S.Ll. Can we offer, to deputn., extension of loan arrangements for Br. claimants.
H.A. If we have to make a concession to avert defeat in H/L., this is best card to play –
if we are sure it will be effective in averting that defeat. Mght risk £1M. (thro’
excessive advances). Wd. want it contingent on not havg. reached agreemt. with
E. by end/Sept. – tho’ we cdn’t say that publicly. Wd. it leak if deputn. were told.
Hail. Cd. persuade Peers either to cancel or to p’pone debate or not to press for division.
5. Economic Situation.
H.A. Explained relaxations to be made in restriction of Bank credit and in operation of
Capital Issues Cttee.
H.B. These relaxations, tho’ welcome, in private sector will make it more diff. to hold
existg. line on public sector – esp. housing.
H.A. We shall have to let up then, but not now. It is public investment which Zurich
watches. And relaxn. wd. operate more quickly in relation to public sector.
6. Prison Reform. [Enter N. McP.
R.A.B. Para. 7 – increase in offenders. Para. 5. : 3 in cell. Urgent need as well as normal
advance in reform.
Don’t want to press H.A. for exact figure for bldg. But extravagant cost of
m’tenanace – e.g. £70.000 p.a. on Dartmoor.
Some need for legn. Also admin’ve. reforms.
Wd. prefer to present Wh. Paper, charting course for future. Wd. need to include
some indication of what we can do, on bldg. etc.,
Don’t want legn. next session. Pre-view wd., however, be helpful.
H.A. Support this genl. approach. Accept need for fwd. move. Agree we shd. discuss
(RAB &amp; I) financial implications.
Hail. Don’t imply tht. we are going to build lots of prisons, but no hospitals or schools.
G.Ll. I have a Wh. Paper too.
R.A.B. But since the war, housing &amp; educn. have gone well ahead, and this has lagged
behind.
P.M. Hospitals haven’t done too well.
Hail. But let us give impn. of balanced view. Don’t put this out alone.
N.McP. We have ambitions to build pns. too. Nos. in custody have risen by 40% in last 2
years. And we have no detention centres. Reserve our posn. about joining in Wh.
Paper : we cdn’t go along with all E &amp; W proposals.
[Exit N.McP.
 
 
[Enter J.B-C.
7. Pensions.
Note not taken.
