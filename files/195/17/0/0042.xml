  <content>C.C.58(58) 16th July, 1958
1. Middle East. [Enter 3 Serv. Min., Att.G., E.H.
P.M. Summarised military possibilities.
Stated legal posn. as advised by Att.Genl. Wd. we report to U.N.
Att.G. Quoted Art. 2(7) of Charter – no interference with domestic affairs of any State.
If we can keep w’in that, we can keep U.N. out. But politically may be advisable
to inform U.N. We shd. be under oblign. to report to U.N. if we began to use
force to assist them in m’taining their independence.
K. Wise to notify to U.N. that we were going in.
D.S. For limited objective of holding airfield &amp; protecting King &amp; his capital, our plan
will suffice. If larger U.K./U.S. opn. became necessary it wd. be bridgehead for
that.
They can be supplied by air. No gt. risk of attack on them by J. Army. Mght
stiffen waverers in Iraq army.
P.M. Diplomatic situation.
Recommend tht. S.Ll. goes to W’ton to-night – accompanied by Hayter &amp;
Dickson. Agreed.
S.Ll. Dilemma : time factor. J. mght go in 24 hrs. But dare not act w’out consulting
U.S. Suggest we send to F.D., while I am on my way, draft of tel. we wd. like to
send to Jordan.
P.M. Shd. we not m’while send interim to Jordan – outlining force we cd. supply and
y| indicatg. basis on wh. he shd. found his appeal : and making it clear tht. on ques
wtr we shd. so act we are consultg. U.S.
R.A.B. Legal situation. Doubt if we can rely for this purpose, on Art. 2(7). Public
opinion won’t like it, if we do even less twds U.N. than U.S. have done in respect
of Lebanon.
P.M. F.D. has clothed his action in a wealth of U.N. resolns. and procedures.
Att.G. U.S. are intervening in situation where force has already bn. used.
R.A.B. They are not using any.
R.M. U.N. were already in Lebanon up to the neck.
P.M. Vital, long-term need is tht. U.S/U.K. shd. move together. We must wait one
more day and try to keep the Alliance. Best of all wd. be to get U.S. contribn. If
not a joint force, they must be as much in support of us in J. (U.N. &amp; otherwise)
as we are in support of them in L.
R.A.B. Still want information from Israel. Are we sure they will accept our intervention?
S.Ll. Doubts about King invited us in to help in preserving order. Legally may be
better. Politically, better to base it on “indirect aggression”.
 
 
Hail. Best to get him to make an unconditional request.
Att.G. Then we wd. act w’out sure knowledge of facts.
P.M. Optimum : U.S. co-opn. – desirable, not only politically, but militarily too, for
their larger aircraft can bring in heavier weapons &amp; better supply. Then we cd.
together consider how to restore sitn. in Iraq.
Next best : get U.S. support for U.K. operation – and their help &amp; advice with
U.N.
S.Ll. Israel : Amb. here judges tht. our proposed action wd. be acceptable to his Govt.
H. Is it safe to send force of this size w’out U.S. support.
D.S. Yes : cd. expand it to 4.000 – and objective limited.
H.W. Want advance assurance of U.S. support if we get into trouble.
P.M. If F.D. does commit himself, he will see it through.
Finally, are we sure it will improve posn. of King Hussein?
W’drew suggn. at y/ – holding tel. to J. shd. merely say S.Ll. is going to U.S. to
discuss.
G.Ll. Don’t disregard dangers. Suppose Iraq claimed J. was part of united country &amp;
sent I. army v. us in J?
D.S. V. unlikely. As we can’t mount expedn. v. Iraq from J., so they cd. not easily
mount opn. v. us in J.
C.S. If it went wrong, nos. wdn’t help : it wd. be because out-weaponed. Heavy
weapons cd. only be provided by U.S. – from Germany. They ought to be at
readiness to act at once.
H.W. Key to this is therefore U.S. Globemasters.
K. The other risk is that, if we don’t act quickly J. may go over to Nasser.
P.M. Holding tel. to J. Don’t discuss basis on wh. he shd. appeal – reserve that for
discn. with U.S.
S.Ll. to go to W’ton.
Optimum : Full Anglo-U.S. operation.
Next best : 3700 U.K. force, with token U.S. contn.
Third : U.S. will support initiative, as we do theirs in Lebanon, &amp; cooperate
in U.N. etc.,
Seek joint U.S./U.K. planning for M/East as a whole – politico-military.
M’while study legal basis : tell our man in Amman how it shd. be framed if King
wishes to act before US/UK agreement is reached.
2. Cyprus.
 
 
ALB. Govr. wants to ban T. terrorist force (T.M.T.) &amp; arrest its leaders. Also to act v.
Eoka. All official advice (C.O. &amp; F.O.) favours it. But I believe it to be
inexpedient at this moment.
K. Madness to take anti-Muslim action now.
S.Ll. F.O. believe T. wd. take this. Why not act v. Eoka &amp; tell T. Govt. to instruct their
organn. to lay off because of sitn. in M/E. generally.
Agreed : C.O. to have authy. to make arrests (not proscribing organn. if,
after caution re wider M/E. interests, Govr. persists in his request.
