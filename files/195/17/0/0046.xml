  <content>C.C.65(58) 29th July, 1958
1. Meeting of Heads of Govt. [Enter E.H., J.E.S., E.M.
P.M. Indicated probable line of reply to K.’s latest note.
S.Ll. Fr. are opposed to quick reply.
2. Broadcasting.
K. PMG. has converted me to view tht. enquiry wd. be politically preferable. H.A.
Cttee. thght decisions cd. be taken by Ministers. Sub-Cttee. has considered it
further. Decn. on this now submitted to Cabinet.
P.M. Largely a political question.
E.M. Must say something on 3rd. channel T.V. 2 year-period expires March ’59. Right
decisions wd. be to have none – no public demand – and to concentrate on full
coverage for existg. channels. Also decn. pending on no. of “lines”.
If we had a new channel, any decn. wd. be v. unpopular. But so wd. decision not
to have one – for p’mme cos. cd. stimulate demand for it.
I therefore prefer enquiry. Normally to have one before renewing charter of
B.B.C. Three years needed normally : 18 mos. for Cttee. &amp; 18 to consider its
report. (Charter expires 1962).
P.M. Wise to get periods of BBC and ITA co-terminous. ?By extending B.BC. to
1964.
R.A.B. Highly contentious. Favour enquiry. But high-grade Chairman needed.
Hail. I’m not in favour of wide enquiry. It will arouse pol. controversy – a) from highminded
supporters of B.B.C. b) from p’mme contractors, who reckoned on clear
run to ’64 and are now doing well – and are sensitive to criticism of their profits.
c) tho’ general enquiry must be held sometime, operative date for decn. is not until
’64 &amp; it wd. be likely tht., if we have one enquiry now, there will be 2.
There is no case for 3rd. p’mme T.V. Don’t need to have enquiry for that. Wrong
to have enquiry pending during Election – for we want to claim credit for I.T.A.
and shan’t be free to do so if it’s sub iudice.
Ready to have enquiry into limited technical ques of 3rd. p’mme &amp; lines.
Ch.H. That is only urgent question. We cd. justify decision to p’pone that. General
enquiry : telescope B.B.C. and I.T.A. enquiries. Announce tht. this will be held
e.g. 1962 and techn. ques taken with it. Can’t suggest enquiry now wd. settle
what shd. be done in ’62 for B.B.C. and ’64 for I.T.A.
E.M. This Govt. wd. then lose control over compn. and t. of r. of enquiry.
J.E.S. Third p’mme wd. involve £7 m. capital expenditure.M’tenance (if under B.B.C.) wd.
mean increased fee of £1 and no surrender of £4 M. revenue to Ty. [Enter S.Ll.
 
 
I.M. We cd. gain credit by turning down 3rd. channel on basis we must first cover
whole country with existing p’mmes.
Ty. cd. then be left to milk the profits.
J.H. What is wrong with big profits on big risks?
J.E.S. Also discriminatory taxation wd. be undesirable.
P.M. But large profits, arising from monopolies handed out by State, are open to
criticism. Tho’ Press won’t start that.
x | P’pone enquiry for a year or so. Make plan to harmonise periods of BBC and
| I.T.A. On 3rd. p’mme, decline to announce a decision or say that, given posn. of
| capital exp’re, country shd. make do with 2 channels. Preferably 2nd. of these
| alternatives.
E.M. Wd. try to carry that line. When shd. we make announcement?
Ch.H. y | Wait until Parlt. re-assembles.
Agreed as at x/. and y/.
3. Opening of Parliament : Television.
R.A.B. Film (colour) wd. have avoided transmission of whole Speech. But technical
diffies. – light and heat 6 times greater. Almost intolerable for the Queen.
D.S. Cd. have (black &amp; white) film for T.V.
P.M. If we can’t have colour film, better to have actual on T.V. (live).
Ch.H. Colour film, in future, wd. be useful overseas. But this year let us confine
ourselves to T.V. (actual).
1. 2. 3.
E.H. Views in H/C. divided : none/Gallery only/ whole hog. There is a good deal of
opposn. to 3. – esp. as leading to b’castg. of Parly. proccdgs.
J.M. Intuitive dislike of whole idea.
P.M. Bound to come : don’t appear to be obstructing the inevitable.
Hail. Has always bn. a public ceremony.
R.A.B. B.B.C. should handle it.
Agreed : announce Thursday in both Houses.
J.E.S. Press will want to take photos. at same time.
P.M. Limit it to 3.
R.A.B. Want Opening on 28/x. Awkward because D/Ed. was to be in Canada.
[Exit E.M.
 
 
4. Middle East.
S.Ll. Mtg. of Bagdad Pact. Declaration published. Future organisation of Pact –
agreed to “coast along” pro. tem. Para. 4 of declaration has effect of bringing
U.S. more closely into defence association in M/E., tho’ without need of
Congressional approval of a formal Treaty.
3 M/E. members of Pact all favour recognition of new Govt. in Iraq. U.S. are of
same opinion. Wishful thinking to suppose they are v. nice. But Govt. does
contain some liberal elements. Includes also a nasty Rashid Ali element. Not
therefore a v. savoury Govt. Much of the agitation was v. feudalism, not v. West.
Germans will recognise tomorrow. Other Europeans likely to follow.
On practical grounds it is in our interest to recognise.
The new Govt. has promised to honour internatl. obligtns.
No reason therefore to w’hold recognition.
G.Ll. Why have T. so quickly changed course? A few days ago threatened invasion.
S.Ll. Practical reasons – realised they cdn’t act w’out support &amp; wdn’t get it.
H. Pak. similarly have come right round &amp; favour recognition.
A.L.B. What is legal posn. of Arab Union? How do we stand on that?
S.Ll. It has some of the attributes of a State. But one member can dissolve it. More
like a Federation.
A.L.B. Difficult choice. Nauseating method. Calculated murders – not mob violence.
Planned extermination of all Hashamites. In earlier days Britain wd. not have bn.
so quick to recognise.
But can’t refuse to face facts – if they are in fact in control of whole country.
Hope our informn. is accurate. E.g. Turkish communities : surprising if they have
gone wholly over.
Also consider effect on Hussein (Jordan). Shall we be encouraging violent
revolution there?
S.Ll. De facto recognition would make it possible to continue to pretend that Arab
Union has not lapsed. But we need to discuss further.
R.A.B. Not sure this Govt. controls mob.
S.Ll. But mob victory wd. produce worse Govt. still. Army is steadying influence.
Hussein : believe he realises recognition is inevitable : matter of presentation
mainly.
P.M. x | V. unpleasant. But believe there is no alternative. Good that Muslim Govts. are
| anxious to lead the way. Br. interests will be served by recognition.
Propose to act accordingly twds end of this week.
Agreed as at x/.
1. Heads of Govt. Mtg. (resumed).
 
 
S.Ll. There will be diffy. re India. U.S. won’t agree to it. There are 30 or so claiming
to come.
P.M. Cd. ask countries to come to table one at a time.
H. Doubt if Nehru wd. come on that basis to N. York.
S.Ll. F.D. says he can’t distinguish betwn. Nehru and States more interested.
H. N.’s statement is not helpful. Wd. be little advantage in having him there.
[Exit H.5. Dr.
Alan Nunn May.
R.A.B. Haven’t had time to get a line on him. [Exit S.Ll.
6. Development Areas. [Enter Erroll.
I.M. i) We started with bias v. publn. of a list.
But decided a) we cdn’t sell the plan to industrialists w’out it.
b) it wd. be prised out of us.
ii) Tougher attitude to I.D.C.’s – as in first part of statement.
Propose to make public as written Answer to P.Q. Wednesday.
A.L.B. x | Places will say “unemplt. is likely to persist here, acc. to Govt.” V. damaging.
R.A.B. Also gives impn. of high unemplt. in so many places.
M. V. doubtful course at this moment, when we are trying to help industry generally.
Places don’t seem v. important.
I.M. Cd. avoid words at x/.
P.M. V. odd list – for Aug : a list of holiday resorts.
Cd. we, both in answer and in list, generalise a bit more : make it clear tht. whole
lot is not more than 7% of total populn.
Erroll. (ii) represents change of policy. But no absolute rule v. developmt. Matter of
administrative discretion.
