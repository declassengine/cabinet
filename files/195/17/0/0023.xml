  <content>C.C.33(58) 21st April, 1958
1. Territorial Waters. [Enter E.H., S., G.W., Alport., Att.G.
P.M. Voting in Cttee. shows majority in favour of 12 miles. But no recommn. has
emerged on defence limit : only a proposal (by majority) on exclusive fishing.
In Plenary the Canadian proposal on fishing will come forward – also the Mexico-
Indian and the U.S.
We shd. speak &amp; vote against Canadian (fishing) and Mexico-Indian.
Shd. we vote for US. resoln. Wd. it then be said before Court that we had favoured
a 6 mile limit?
Att.G. No. Speech by Gros (France) made it clear tht. such vote on a proposal which
failed did not prejudice subsequent attitude before court. U.S. resoln. can’t get
⅔rds majority. But w’out it we risk swing to the Mexico-Indian proposal. If we
can defeat that, there will be no majority in favour of any extension of the
territorial sea.
S.Ll. What of declaration?
Att.G. Favoursmaking that if Mexico-Indian proposal succeeds.
Att.G. If Can. proposal on fishing were carried, we wd. have to consider wtr we wd. sign
Convention. It might be possible to make a reservation on that particular Article.
P.M. We shd. speak &amp; vote against this Canadian proposal. Agreed.
Do we vote for U.S. proposal – in order to reduce chance of any proposal getting
⅔rds. majority.
J.H. No objn. so long as no further whittling down.
Att.G. No risk of that. U.S. won’t compromise any further.
P.M. Then, qua fishing, we had better support U.S. resoln. What of defence?
D.S. Wd. be happier if Art. 24 (previous authorisation) was made subject to Art. 17.
Att.G. So wd. I. But no chance of getting Art. 24 amended (⅔rd. majority).
Only hope is to get ⅓rd. minority for excluding this Article – so that on this ques
existing law would rule.
D.S. Art. 17(1)?
Att.G. Has bn. altered by Cttee.
S. Art. 17 is an improvement.
Att.G. Aircraft. U.S. are as much concerned as we are. We must work with them for
some improvement. But if we didn’t support U.S. proposal &amp; Mexico-Indian
were carried, mil. aircraft wd. be even worse off.
We shd. state, if majority for U.S. proposal, that before ratification provision shd.
be made for passage by aircraft.
 
 
J.H. Indian attitude. Cd. they be influenced by message from P.M. to Nehru.
Att.G. Mght be v. useful – if we decide to support U.S. proposal – especially now Sen is
in Delhi. Agreed.
Att.G. Is it agreed we shd. make declaration if Mexico-Indian proposal is carried, by any
majority?
S.Ll. Depends how many countries subscribed to it.
Att.G. Maritime Powers – a collection which cd. be so described.
P.M. Mght weaken our posn. if only a few supported it.
Att.G. Don’t want, however, to lobby too many people.
Agreed as above.
Appreciation for work of Att.G.
2. Aden.
P.M. Two having evaded arrest, presume you won’t deport the third.
A.L.B. No. If we get Mohammed, we will deport both.
P.M. We must re-consider situation on basis of who is arrested. Authy. for deportn.
suspended m’while.
3. Malta.
A.L.B. Mintoff will resign to-night.
4. The Budget.
H.A. Propose to w’draw retrospn. Can say to-day that I am considering this – or that
I have decided.
RAB. Not worth having trouble with Party over this. Favour letting it emerge on text of
Finance Bill.
I.M. Yes : otherwise Labour Party may want to vote – having said they won’t.
P.M. On balance favour not making final announcement to-day.
