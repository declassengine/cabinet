  <content>C.C.26(58) 27th March, 1958
1. Parliament. [Enter E.H., O.G.
R.A.B. Business for next week.
Dates of Easter Recess – date of Budget.
2. Rent Act.
H.B. We shall do all we can by adminve. means to reduce hard core before Oct.
Concentrate on period immediately after 6/10. If no action, there will be many
cases of eviction wh. p. opinion wdn’t tolerate – in Ldn, Glasgow and seaside
towns. There wd. then be irresistible pressure for emergency legn.
Resolved not to compromise main structure : principle of decontrol. But we must
ease transition. Hence propose the legn. outlined in memo.
P.M. Para. 6(ii) merely brings law into line with existing practice – not therefore so
drastic as it seems at first sight.
H.B. Tests in 6(v) are vital point. Early legislation on this will spur parties to reach
settlement.
V. largely a problem of old people.
J.M. Can’t get reliable estimates of actual hardship involved in Glasgow – tho’ v.
much irritation. Cd. prs. have ridden out storm : but as E &amp; Wales can’t I go
along with this proposal.
P.M. i) Is this workable? ii) What pol. effects will it have – encroaching on principle?
iii) Presentn. and timing.
K. (i) Practicability. If 5-10,000 cases in Ldn, spreading cases over 12 mos., it is
manageable – tho’ will put a strain on Courts &amp; I may have to appoint more Co.
Ct. Judges. A much larger no. of cases wd. frustrate the measure.
H.B. Tenants will have greater incentive to reach agreement with l’lords.
P.M. But a mass movement cd. block the courts, and leave tenants free to squat on.
K. Para. 6(vi). Add ultimate limit there : for without it tenant is in same posn. as
under Rent Act.
H.B. Para. 6(x) puts a limit of 3 years.
About 50% of cases – agreement reached already.
P.M. Risk of boycott &amp; abuse?
Hail. V. diff. to block Co. Courts. Judges are mobile, and deputies can be appointed.
[I.M. y| This special concession to hard core of 25.000 will outrage the 775.000 people
| who have made agreements, often under duress.]
[R.A.B. Para. 6(ii). Such credit as we have gained with l’lords by firmness may be lost by
this.]
 
 
H.W. Cd. scope of measure be narrowed?
[H.B. x/ Designed, as is, to help aged, disabled and widows with large families.
Ch.H. Believe it will help much wider circle : for tests in 6(v) are easy for tenants.
H.B. No : 6(v)(b) won’t be easy save for x/ : others won’t pass this test.
H.W. Cd. you spell that out, by specific definition.]
Conclusion on practicability : on balance, affirmative.
(ii) Political considerations.
Note [ ] above are all political.
P.M. Turns practice into law. Turns 4-6 wks. into 9 mos. and prs. more. Eases
transition in that sense. But is it wiser to ride out storm? That really turns on
estimate of pol. diffies. of hard cases.
RAB. We have screwed up our supporters to see this thro’. They will be surprised at
volte face. But in Ldn. we mght have serious demonstrations in autumn –
evictions all coming at fixed date – wh. mght entail recall of Parlt. On other hand,
under Bill some decns. wd. come out at even more critical political time.
If introduced v. soon Bill cd. be passed by end/Apl. This is not a moment for pol.
concession. Wd. prefer therefore to take it after Whitsun recess and pass by 2/7.
Apart from pol. sitn. Parly. p’mme is v. heavily overloaded. This Bill wd. take 5
to 6 Parly. days. Wd. therefore entail long over-spill in autumn.
P.M. We might, as quid pro quo, reduce length of Finance Bill by omitting some of the
“Departmental” tidying-up clauses.
I.M. One of worst spots is Ealing – where bye-election is due soon.
H.B. Feeling is growing even outside worst spots.
H.W. Even in Woking there is trouble. It’s the old people who haven’t the will to look
for other accomn.
H.A. Cd. you limit it to old, disabled etc.,
Hail. No : because families with many children.
H. What about y/? Demand for retrospection.
H.B. Majority of agreements are at 2½ times gross value or lower. But a fringe have
bn. forced to accept less favourable terms.
P.M. But they might not have succeeded under Bill.
J.H. These are consequences we foresaw. If we pass this Bill, shall we have courage
not to extend it.
 
 
Hail. Will be regarded as evidence of miscalculation of no. of evictions likely to result
from Rent Act. Will therefore be major reverse for Govt. Will also mean that,
instead of getting over the trouble in Oct., there will be a running trickle
stretching into Election period. Those we have encouraged to support Act will
feel much let down.
But can Govt. stand pol. outcry in autumn? Believe estimate of cases is right. If
so, we can’t hope to ride it out. On balance therefore favour Bill. But it will be
cruel blow to our credit.
I.M. Accept that. But it is major pol. defeat.
H.W. Loans etc.,?
Hail. No. Nos are too large.
(iii) Timing.
R.A.B. Pol. arguments for delay. Govt. credit is rising.
H.B. Strong arguments the other way. i) Can now do it from strength. Have said I am
watching position. ii) L’lords will be taking decisions betwn. now &amp; Oct. iii) If
we act later, will be attributed to Local elections. iv) Liberals will run it v. soon.
R.M. Strength of y/. Measure shd. therefore be as small as possible : also as early on
that account.
H.A. Wdn’t favour this if we cd. ride it out. Doubt if we can. If we act, let us do so v.
soon &amp; in as limited a measure as possible. Worried about those who have made
more expensive agreements.
Hail. Limiting. Not by defining classes. But in 6(v)(c) don’t limit criterion to hardship
: e.g. inequitable having regard to all circs. incldg. hardship.
M. Pol. argument. Every strong action puts our credit up : every concession brings it
down. Don’t overlook that.
D.E. Have we made full survey and considering other expedients – e.g. getting people
to buy and give new agreements.
H.B. Diffy. of survey – situation is developing all the time.
Ch.H. Last part of 6(viii) surely will discourage more agreemts being made.
[Exit J.H.
H.B. I wd. be willing to legislate on basis of 2½ times flat. But Scotland want
opportunity for lower figure.
Ch.H. But we mustn’t depart fr. basic aim of Act viz., to promote movement.
P.M. Logical to restrict aid to (vi) – and not to go into ques of rent.
J.M. But many of those affected will be above Assistce. Bd. level.
 
 
Hail. But do you think it right to expect l’lord to subsidise those who can’t afford econ.
rent?
[Exit H.B.
3. Malta.
A.L.B. Letter fr. Mintoff. Statement by Olivier: who fears M.’s antics may involve
suspension of constitn. Olivier also thinks well of alternative offer. Ends my fear
tht. M. &amp; O. wd. unite on independence. In electn. he mght advocate our
alternative.
Dissolution can’t be refused. In Election campaign shd. Govr. remain neutral : or
shd. he make it plain that complete independence cd. not be secured.
P.M. Tell Govr. i) he can’t refuse dissoln. ii) we will advise him how to handle
financial sitn. &amp; how long he waits before assumg control : C.O. &amp; Ty. to consider
urgently and advise on this. iii) on intervention, he shd. at present say no more
than justify Govt. policy as pursued h’to.
Both ii) and constitutional issues shd. then be referred to C.P. Cttee.
[Exit A.L.B.
[Enter DW-S.
4. Wages Policy : N. Health Service.
DW-S. Cttee. on Wages are ready to support scheme A.
P.M. Sensible scheme at 3.7%. Scheme B. is less good but only 3%
H.A. Dislike both. Embarrassing. We give under either more than we refused earlier.
But admit B. is bad scheme. I wd. have preferred principle of A, but assimilations
giving about 2½%. But if we have to do A as it stands, play it slow and stress regrading.
We are committed to solution on basis of N. Hall.
I.M. Re-vamping structure is, fr. my angle, less troublesome than flat 3%. Moreover,
whole purpose was to hold this back until main claims came along. They are here
now.
R.A.B. How reconcile this with what I had to say to fire-women.
M. Can we not p’pone this until we know result of rlway claim?
D.W-S. No agreemt. will be reached, in negotn., until at least 14/4.
H.A. Back-dating will be held back for later decision.
DW-S. I am only suggesting 1/3 : which is v. modest.
P.M. Negotiation must be continued on basis of Cab. preference for Scheme A, and
M/H. to keep in touch with H.A. on timing of concln. &amp; on retrospection.
After further discussions –
P.M. Why not p’pone mtg. for a time.
D.W-S. Fixed for 31/3. Hard to get management side to agree that now.
 
 
H.A. Must also avoid announcement of concln. until May.
I.M. If we p’pone mtg. until after Easter, we must say we will then have definite
proposals to put fwd.
P.M. Then p’pone until 14/4.
[Exit D.W-S.
5. Foreign Affairs.
(a) Tunisia.
O.G. U.S. have told Bourguiba they cdn’t support his plan w’out frontier control.
Despite this, he won’t contemplate it – not even U.N. control. Fr. will therefore
not agree to rest of plan. Next move must therefore be to get Sec. Genl. into this.
P.M. Why shd. we do any more. Worsens our relns. with French. Much to be said for
dropping “good offices” device.
O.G. If only we cd. get agreemt. on frontier, it wd. be easier for us to defend Fr. posn.
in Sec. Council.
P.M. Why shd. we interfere constantly in Fr. affairs.
I will consider further with F.O.
No action by Beeley w’out further instructions.
(b) Summit Meeting.
P.M. U.S. have accepted statement of W. position – now being discussed in N.A.T.O.
