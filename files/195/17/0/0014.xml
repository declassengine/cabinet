1. Malta. [Enter E.H., O.G.
A.L.B. Not now practicable to adhere to original time-table. Have told Mintoff. Am
discussing with him financial ques. But he may ask our intentns. on integration. I
don’t favour w’drawal if he behaves reasonably. An imposs. moral posn. &amp;
inconsistent with Commonwealth theme.
Alternatives : i) White Paper : but wd. include refce. to integration and cause
a storm in Party.
ii) Legn. having effect later. M. wdn’t accept that.
But these may be academic. For M. may now a) attach condns. to financial
settlement because of uncertainty over d’yard. b) seek dissoln. on platform of
complete severance fr. U.K. – tho’ Treaty later on Libyan model. Believe M. wd.
win. We wd. then have to revert to direct rule.
One other course – to revert to 5 yr. moratorium plan. This wd. give them all the
econ. provisions : decln. of intentn. on integration but p’ponement for 5 yrs. He
won’t accept. Dangerous to put it forward.
Decision for to-day : if he behaves reasonably, can I say that we stand by
integration tho’ time-table will need to be changed.
P.M. Reasonable behaviour – w’draw resoln. : accept redn. next year at £1M. because
can be raised locally : return carry-overs of £450.000 from 1957 Budget :
dockyard – accept there is work for 3 yrs : about same level until 1960, and some
admy. work thereafter for private firms in d’yard.
H. Any chance of p’poning integration at cost of increasing financial aid.
K. Can’t afford to lose Malta – esp. now there is risk of Nasser empire in N. Africa.
We ought therefore to seek support at W’minster for integration. Thus, if he is
reasonable now, we ought to go on with it. Labour wd. drop their criticism of M.
if it cd. be shown that we had bn. mean.
R.A.B. Cd. only get it thro’ by Socialist votes. That can hardly be represented as a
success, for us. Oppn. among our supporters has bn. increased by M.’s behaviour.
On the whole, it wd. be best if hand cd. be so played so as to avoid having to
proceed with integration.
H.A. Yes : wdn’t be regarded by Party as a Imperial success.
H. Or by the country.
H.A. Therefore, best to get twds. moratorium.
J.H. Agree : play for that.
I.M. We can’t afford, politically, to put this thro’ by Socialist votes.
Hail. Party is against it. We must keep our word. But avoid having to do so if we
possibly can.
P.M. Mintoff can’t be allowed to play fast &amp; loose. If he behaves reasonably now,
doubt if we need give direct answer on integration question. Equally, don’t like
 
 
to break on £1M. Bring out that dockyard sitn. hasn’t yet arisen : emplt. there will
continue at least until 1960.
Can we not say we shall have t consider situation in view of all that has bn. done
&amp; said in Malta m’while. That wd. be reason for moratorium. Avoid dropping
integration as consequences of argument on money.
M’while, say no more on integration than – must consider that with my
colleagues. M. has come over to discuss money.
A.L.B. But amounts are bound up with money. He is now £2M. short of what he wd. get
under integration.
Hail. My informn. is tht. he has come here to seek a casus belli. Let us play it long.
A.L.B. Even so, my moral posn. is stronger if I can say we stand by our pledge on
integration.
P.M. We shd. not take initiative in going back on integration plan.
We shd. not drop it in consequence of disagreement on £1M.
x| Better to ask him to write down exactly what he means to do, on integration,
| &amp; promise to consider it with colleagues.
Mere w’drawal of resoln. can’t cancel whole effect of its having bn. moved.
Hail. Don’t try to buy M. out of integration. If we do, we’ll be buying him all the time.
P.M. If ques is raised, push initiative over to him as at x/ – on a/c of his recent
behaviour. Avoid direct answer yes or no.
Agreed : pro. tem. as at x/.
E.H. Party situation is v. bad. Deeply split. Worse than over Cyprus. We can’t allow
it to run on for long like this.
2. Northern Ireland : Unemployment. [Enter A.J.
R.A.B. Draft letter gives Brookeboro’ as much as he can hope. But we can give this
much.
A.L.B. Malta will pray in aid what is said here about d’yard.
J.M. It will also have repercussions in respect of development areas in Scotland.
H.A. Can’t oppose this qua N.I. But reserve my position on repercussions.
P.M. Let us have a report from Chandos on position – progress and prospects. Let
Minister who appointed him call for it.
[Exit A.J.
[Enter Att. G., Allan.
 
 
3. Territorial Waters.
Att.G. Memo. written on assumptn. we cdn’t hold to 3 miles. But sure we shd. fight for
it as long as possible – &amp; hope U.S. will do so too.
Debate on fishing will be held first. Ask therefore for authy. to say then tht. we
oppose any extensions for that &amp;advocate conservation instead. Wd. hold our
posn.
Since then, however, Tel. 65. Advice : better no conclusion.
Also Tel. 68. Fair chance of blocking 12 mile terr. limit.
Cuban Delegate doubts if Latin Americans will be content with 12 miles.
Thus U.S. compromise of 3+9 is unlikely to succeed. Wd. gain more support than
12 m. limit.
Our policy shd. therefore be to go on fighting for 3 m. limit – oppose any further
area for fishing – put fwd. conservation proposals – get blocking majority –
discourage U.S. fr. putting fwd. their compromise. Wd. like authy. to put our 6 m.
plan, much later, so as to appear constructive: and thus to get blocking minority of
a worse conclusion.
Immediately, seek authy. i) to speak more strongly v. extended area of
exclusion fishing.
ii) to inform U.S. of Our attitude on that in order to
prevent them from submitting their compromise.
J.H. V. dangerous for us to support U.S. compromise. Support Att.G. on both points.
P.M. Approve att.G.’s proposals.
I will so inform Pres. Eisenhower.
[Exit Att. G. Allan.
4. Farm Price Review.
Adjourned until 3.30 pm.
