  <content>C.C.87(58) 23rd December, 1958
1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter E.H.
S.Ll. a) NATO Mtg. A good talk (preliminary) on Berlin.
b) European F.T. area. Talk with de Gaulle – warned him tht. if Six adopted
discriminatory line, they wd. develop into political entity.
Consultn. etc., (strategic) – v . grandiose ideas. Carving up world into sectors
with internl. mil. staff.
c) Egypt : Finance. Agreemt. with Shell is condl. on inter-Governmental
agreement. Black has put his visit fwd. to end/Dec. Tempo quickened – may be
chance of agreemt. Quick settlement wd. be in our interest.
H.A. Grateful to Black. Two points i) £3.3 M. drawing 40% wd. be for U.K. Govt. &amp;
shareholders in Canal Co. After consultn. with Black, wd. be ready if it wd. be
helpful to make this concession in advance – tho’ I wd. prefer to make it part of
full settlement. I wd. not make the other (for aircraft) available in advance. First
instalment is small (5%) &amp; E. Govt. shd. be able to meet it.
d) German Note. Fr. want quick reply – to get on with discussions early in
the 6 months. NATO will consider draft. We propose 3 part note – i) historical
(on opposn. to Hitlerism) ii) Potsdam Agreemt : is not source of our rights in
Berlin iii) merits : cdn’t remain “free” : Sov. note not an ultimatum : wd. be ready
to join talks.
This genl. line is endorsed by U.S., France &amp; Germany.
2. Cyprus.
S.Ll. When it appeared in U.N. tht. Gks. wd. not get their way, G. &amp; T. For. Ministers
had 2 talks – wide autonomy, 50/50 participn., independence.
Talks in Paris – desire for G/T friendship – statesmenlike approach. T. prob.
shocked by Iraq &amp; turning twds Europe. G. prob. bored with problem &amp; sick of
Makarios.
Worth pursuing.
Plan. Treaty betwn. communities – both languages : 35% of C. Serv. for T. : veto
rights to communities on f. affairs, defence &amp; communal ques.
All rather vague. As to relations of 2 Govts twds this – tho’ clear tht. Treaties are
contemplated. For U.K., bases with B. sovereignty (at U.K. choice) guaranteed
by Treaty. The whole to be dressed up as “independence” – tho’ a v. limited sort
in fact.
They asked me if it was worth while for them to explore this basis. I said I wd.
give them early answer.
Dangers. i) G/T. agreement unacceptable to us (cf. Sudan). But it is T. Govt., not
T. community. ii) B. bases, while rest of Cyprus not under our control (cf. Canal
Zone base : Ceylon). But key is wtr G. &amp; T. Govts become parties to the
obligations to us.
I recommend tht. we shd. encourage G. &amp; T. Govts to explore this.
P.M. Must ensure tht. Bases wd. be usable – access as well as defence. And safeguards
re status of remainder – pro-Western.
But we wd. be abandoning Br. territory – pol. criticism here.
x| Tone of reply : not so cold as to discourage a G/T. initiative : not so warm as to
commit us to solution we cdn’t in the end accept.
 
 
A.L.B. Interestg. developmt. T. are now moving fr. confidence, not fear. But doesn’t
follow tht. soln. acceptable to G. &amp; T. wd. be agreeable to us.
Bases. Good tht they are ready to leave us to demarcate them.
Favour encouraging answer subject to x/.
Party : concerned mainly with bases.
D.S. In favour. A base in Cyprus – not Cyprus as a base – will meet our defence
needs. And Cyprus in disorder is mil. liability, not asset.
Hail. i) Hope this won’t hinder our effort to destroy Eoka.
ii) Hope even this Cyprus may be associated with Commonwealth.
P.M. There shd. be no doubt of (i) : Govr. must understand tht. momentum must be
kept up.
R.A.B. These 2 For. Ministers are wholly unreliable. Don’t put too much faith in them.
But let them try.
I.M. This developmt. reflects growing strength of U.K. Govt.
H.A. Reserve judgement on (ii) until we see what sort of Cyprus it is.
1. General agreement.
2. Draft of message to G. &amp; T. Govts. approved.
3. Views of Govr.
4. Cttee. of officials (F.O. C.O &amp; M/D.) to prepare for tri-partite talks.
3. Aircraft Industry. [Exit S.Ll.
[Enter A.J., G.W.
Note not taken.
General approval of memo. by M/Supply.
P.M. This discn. has given us broad apprecn. of problem. We dominated the sea for
generations : we can’t abdicate in the air.
Suggest we re-constitute Mills’ Cttee. with enlarged t. of r. I will preside at first
few mtgs to work out a genl. directive.
* Note : widen t. of r. to mention mil. needs.
4. Scottish Aviation Ltd.
J.M. Firm will close at end/Jan. unless some action taken. 40/60 positive enquiries for
’plane of wh. at least ⅓rd. shd. mature.
E.P.C. agreed tht. £50.000 shd. be advanced if Fin. Corpn. put up similar sum.
Weekes thinks we cd. give more subject to i) re-appraisal of price : wh. shd. be
higher, for the R.A.F. order. ii) redn. of p’mme. An ex gratia paymt. on a/c mght
be justified : total sum might be over £200,000. That amount of spares are ready
to be delivered to R.A.F.
H.A. I will look at last point.
I doubt if this company will be saved. But ready to take some risks.
 
 
A.J. This firm is foundering – and I doubt if it will pull round. Don’t see why E.
Electric shd. rescue it.
I have accelerated progress paymts – by £40.000 more than normal. Can I go
further? Price : they didn’t get as large an order as they hoped. But I can’t settle
that before early Jan. Shd. I make payment on a/c : Acc. Offr. won’t do it w’out
directive from Minister : and I won’t do it w’out dirn. from Cabinet. If these are
spares not already covered by progress payments, I can pay for those. And, on repricing,
I cd. consider some advance ex gratia (say £50.000).
P.M. Try and buy them some time by paying for any spares made but not delivered and
giving some advance on the ex gratia payment for revised prices. [J.M. and A.J.
to report to H.A. and P.M.]
[Exit A.J.
[Enter PMG.
5. Investment Programme.
H.A. Figures for 1960 and 1961 must be regarded as ceilings for planning, tho’ we
shall look at them again.
E.M. We alone are to reduce steadily. Diff. for us – esp. on definition : for £9 M p.a.
consist of alterations &amp; removals of telephones : and tel. ducts on new roads, or
alterations due to road works. None of this is really cap. investment.
H.A. In earlier years, the P.O. have bn. running higher than other Dpts. And they use
same resources.
M. The whole thing is faintly ridiculous. Re-enter S.Ll.
G.Ll. Minor works.
H.A. No!
J.M. Sc. education figures are still under discn. with Ty. Reserve this
Sc. electricity .. .. .. .. .. ..
H.W. Roads. Para. 16. To keep w’in this limit – we will do our best. But if we have a
fine summer, it may be hard to slow p’mme down w’out public comment. Shall
try to avoid public disclosure.
[Exit J.M.
[Enter J.B.C.
6. Pensions.
R.A.B. Pros and cons. No v. gt. pol. importance. Cttee. favoured it –ques is wtr H.A. can
agree to it.
H.A. Arguments fairly summarised in memo. But rash to concede this now. Reserve it
as quid pro quo for increase in retirement age which we shall have to face in next
Parlt.
B.C. Gt. pressure for it. Wd. do somethg. for those under £9 p.wk. Complement to
change on earnings rule. Wd. make Bill more acceptable politically.
 
 
H.A. A rising burden over the years.
H.B. Immediate gain doesn’t balance long-term loss.
R.A.B. Wd. be the only change wh. cd. be said to be made in light of debate.
On balance I am in favour of doing this.
Agreed.
H.A. Method of dealing with deficits &amp; surpluses. I had preferred a formula wh. wd.
operate automatically in adjusting contributions. Bill provides for sales in &amp; out
of Fund. I am, however, ready to accept view of my colleagues.
R.A.B. Borrowing : taxation : increased contribns. We wd. prefer to reserve last method
to discretion of Ministers – not automatic.
Prefer to leave Bill as it stands. New system cd. be introduced later : in 2-3 years’
time.
Agreed – Bill as it stands.
[Exit B.C.
7. Civil Aviation : Jet Aircraft.
H.W. As in memo.
R.A.B. Only practicable course.
S.Ll. Agree : provided rules are applied flexibly.
8. British Aluminium Company. [Enter Econ. Secy.
Note not taken.
