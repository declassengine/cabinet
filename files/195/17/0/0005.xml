  <content>C.C.86(57). 31st December, 1957.
1. Foreign Affairs.
P.M. Read message from President E. Extent of Anglo-U.S. co-opn. They are v. ready
to accept suggns. : they are short of ideas.
2. Current Government Business.
Took note of P.M’s memo.
3. Government Records. [Enter Att.G.
[Exit Att.G.
After discussion – agreed tht. Cab. records shd. be opened to public inspn. after 50
years.
4. Public Expenditure.
P.T. In Sept. we came v. near to devaluation of £. To meet that we limited bank
advances &amp; investment to level of last year. The point was then made that Govt.
expenditure was of similar importance : we said merely that steps were being
taken to limit it.
In current year Supplementaries will be heavy. (£100 M) And next year’s
Estimates are £170 M above that level – highest increase ever in peace-time.
We are trying to hold wages by limiting amount of money available.
I cdn’t approve Estimates at that level.
Causes : Education £40 M. ……….. Social Services : £50 M.
Explanations : Agriculture : world prices have fallen – support cost is higher. But
means putting another £28 M into circulation.
“Buoyancy of revenue” – but related to inflation.
G.N.P. wdn’t justify this rise in Esimates.
Won’t be “easier next year” to deal with inflation – nearer Election.
We ought to be planning for £2 or 300 M less expenditure. We ought at least to
see that no more is spent next year than last. What wd. this involve? Put civil &amp;
defence together. Defence is down by £22 M. Civil : up £175 : subtract 22 =
153. That amount must be saved on present Estimates. This wd. mean no new
services; but, w’out major changes of policy, we mght save £40M. For remaining
£113 M, we shd. have to make major decisions. Defence has done much already :
civil shd. make contribn. before more is asked of defence. On civil side,
possibilities are –
School milk &amp; other subsidies £40 M.
Child Allowance for 2nd. Child £65m.
Health Service £20 M. (boarding charge £11 M).
Our economic weakness – due to trying to do too much – will in the end
undermine our influence in the world. If that is to be m’tained, we must
strengthen £. Our greatest danger is, not war, but collapse of sterling.
We have highest level of taxation in world. No salvation thro’ increasing it. It
itself encourages inflation.
Policy decisions : X/ spend no more than last year’s out.turn.
 
 
For that – £40 M. by pruning Estimates.
Another £70-80 from major civil changes.
Balance from further cuts in defence p’mme.
P.M. Premise on which all this rests X/ is a matter of judgement.
Points in discussion – a) Cost of agriculture subsidies. b) Change in priorities.
Compare small amounts put into roads, telephones etc., as cpd. with amounts
provided to supplement or sustain farmers’ incomes. c) No special logic in
sticking to last year’s actual. But advantage is that it draws a line &amp; sets a limit –
and can be understood.
H.B. Accept need for such restraint.
Wd. prefer one major change vice collection of small cuts. Second has bn. done
so many times it can’t yield much more.
A.L.B. Support in theory. In practice cdn’t accept cuts in overseas expenditure.
Necessary in order to avert worse viz., losing out to R. Total Colonial welfare
etc., outlay is only 25% of the £153 M. And failure to provide it often costs us
more – in mil. opns. etc., And my loans etc., are committed years ago.
D.S. As a Govt. we must beat inflation. Our record rests on that. If we succeed in that,
we shall be forgiven unpopularity of cuts – provided they are big &amp; few vice
niggling &amp; numerous.
On defence – I cd. do more but only if major policy decisions were taken. Time
for review of our posn. in world. cf Cyprus – wh. is of no mil. value to us at all.
cf S.E.A. when we keep a carrier because we have decided to put divn. into Siam
at need.
Hail. If P.T.’s premise is right, we must either abandon f. policy or our Col. Empire or
reverse our social (or agric.) policy at home. Can’t achieve it by nibbling at all.
But which cd. we attempt to do, w’out imperilling our pol. future.
Thus, abandon deterrent. But think of political cost.
If we economise on Empire, how can we face our Party?
Social services : fam. allowance on 2nd. child wd. yield £65 M. But we
introduced this in ’45 : put up the amount 1952 ……….
I.M. [Not heard]
J.M. How much of our def. exp’re is on nuclear and missiles. How far are we
interdependent on this with U.S. Cd. we not less on this and more on
conventional that we can do better.
D.S. Room for more co-ordinn. with U.S. But if we cut total much more we shall fall
below e.g. France – and may wreck N.A.T.O.
H. Must aim at £100 M. cut from civil side.
P.M. Useful discussion. P.T.’s heavy burden.
On defence – some gt. prizes if we can hold out a bit longer. If Macmahon Act is
amended, we cd. go for abolition of tests (with inspection). That would save us a
good deal, and gain 5 years of knowledge. This mght appeal to U.K./U.S. opinion
also. If we got that, I wd. rest on havg. all under U.S. control – save our small
bomber force. We have accepted that qua tactical atomic weapons for Army. We
might similarly rely on joint control for S.A.G.W.’s. Wd. we accept this, after
 
 
bombers go, for IRBM.’s sited in UK? Developmt. on thse lines wd. solve
problem of “4th.” nuclear powers.
I wdn’t drop out of nuclear race now – tho’ we cd. look again at some of the
costlier refinements.
No magic in £153 M. Must be able to say that broadly we have held it.
Somewhere between £100 M. and £153 cd. be defended.
Strong support for purpose viz., curb inflation by limiting supply money.
Timing. Good to act by Bill and present lower Estimates. But much to be said
for other method of presenting plan as a whole in Budget. Test shd., however, be
the reln. to the main battle on wage claims. We have already decided to face out a
rlway strike : a much bigger decision than milk or child allowances. For that,
much turns on mood of Unions : they are hesitant now : may be unwise to
provoke them. Too many cuts in social field might be provocative to them – and
might turn mood of public opinion against Govt. This crisis ought to have come
by March. Mght therefore be better not to act on the other side before the Budget.
5% off nos. employed by State – wd. be healthy and welcome.
5. Air Defence of Great Britain.
P.M. Long discussion. Def. Cttee. Can’t recommend to Cab. the abolition of Fighter
Command. Despite mil. arguments, it wd. be impossible to carry such a decision
thro’ N.A.T.O.
P.T. I have reserved my position re P.I.
If we don’t do this, we must find the money elsewhere.
D.S. No hope of getting £40 M off by other means.
I put up proposal re F. Command because I was looking for things which are not
militarily essential.
I can’t accept any inroad into pay &amp; inducements. (£35M)
Will see wtr I can scrape a bit more off R. &amp; D.
P.M. Can we not find some other weapons in respect of which we can rely on U.S.
P.T. £4-5 M. on Sea-slug.
P.M. Can we not cut somethg. on assumption tht. Macmahon amendment will go
through?
6. Civil Aviation.
H.W. M/S. trying to force mergers in industry. B.E.A. want to buy D.H. But they
haven’t made a good offer. Bristol are ready to form new company (merger) to
make aircraft B.E.A. want.
M/S. and I are pushing B’tol/Hawker Siddeley combine.
