1. Foreign Affairs. [Enter J.S.,
S.Ll. A general lull.
Cyprus – ready for conference, if acceptable.
Iceland – industry are in good heart. The 2 Amb. (U.K./US) will be here next
week : can consult on means of disrupting I. Govt.
J.H. Threat of arrest on high seas. Cd. R.N. shadow the only gunboat (Thor).

S.Ll. Mtgs next wk. of Dpts, while Ambassadors are here : report to Cab. in 10 days’

2. Oil Supplies.
P.M. Two ques i) shall we increase reserves? If so, ii) how? M.’s plan wd. enable us
to face interruptn. of M/E. supplies for twice as long as now : &amp; shd. pay
insurance in sterling vice dollars.
M. Oil cos. have spent £60 M. on improving stocks to 15 wks’ supply. But outlay on
increased stocks seems sensible precaution.
J.S. H.A. cd. not consider while here. To me it seems valuable insurance – to make
now when freights are low &amp; oil is cheap. Reasonable cost in reln. to risks. But
cd. not oil. cos. carry more? That need not delay stocking in Govt. storage.
S.Ll. Commend action taken : support proposal to do more.
Shd. we make it known? “V. much strengthened our posn. in resp. of oil stocks”
M. Can spk. of what we have done.
Principle of increasg. stocks further by 2½ m. tons – approved.
Method: { £10 m in existg Govt. stores : on Exchequer.
X { Provide addl. storage at £1½ M. : potash brine.
{Consult with oil cos. on a) storage for another 1¾ m tons
in juxtaposn. to their own.
At present seek only decision on x/.
S.Ll. Cd. we ask U.S. to help – with money.
M. Cos. are international. Am considering means of pooling with N. Americans.
H. y/ Remember pressure during Suez for us to take into a/c our own stocks.
Easier to w’stand that if some of oil in U.K. were held on U.S. a/c.
M. Wd. sooner try agreemt. with Canada.
On y/ remember we got paid for it.
Proposal approved in principle.
Ty. &amp; M/P. to concert on method.
 
 
3. British Transport Commission.
P.M. Two problems – a) how to handle emerging deficit b) how to present it.
A.W. Knowledge of this has bn. kept close. Need not be disclosed before Dec. B.T.C.
prefer to make earlier warning.
Reflects success of deflationary measures.
B.T.C. have money to end/year, but no more. B.T.C. will need extended
borrowing power.
Courses a) have our understanding, but authorise over-draft.
b) give them more money.
B.T.C. want to give prelim. warning : not publish our corres.yet.
M. Has bn. a drop in traffics. Steel is in temporary decline, but will recover in a year
or so, and prodn. will be increased. Coal may be permanent change because of
increased prodn. of oil. Assumptns. re level of coal traffic may not be justified.
Country turning to oil.
P.M. We are increasingly at mercy of Arabs vice miners.
M. Will submit memo. on coal/oil.
J.S. Believe drop in steel is due largely to de-stocking not to reduced demand of
consumer.
A. No : general world redn. in cap. investment. Remedy : greater freedom in
investment.
J.S. H.A. is against bank advances to B.T.C. He wd. prefer to take new borrowing
powers in the Bill.
Serious posn. due to quite light recession. May suggest modernisn. p’mme is too
ambitious.

J.M. ⅓rd. of Sc. steel workers are un/ or under/employed.
J.S. Decn. of Govt. on strip-mill wd. be sign of confidence in revival of steel.
H. We want to make up our minds wtr we face a recession or wtr inflation is still
main threat.
Agreed: (2) Ty. to prepare short appreciation accordingly.*
(1) H.W. and H.A. to discuss method of carrying rlway deficits
 
 
and presenting the problem.
[Enter E.H.
[P.M. with a view to enabling us to decide wtr reserves are strong enough to warrant our
using some to stimulate economy.]
