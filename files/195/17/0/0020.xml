  <content>C.C.29(58) 3rd April 1958
1. Local Unemployment. [Enter E.H., B-C., Str.
H.A. Local, rather than general, unemplt. is present problem. Not confined to
developmt. areas. Suggest legn. to give same powers (Ty) to lend to industrialists
outside dev. areas as exist already inside those areas – to establish or extend
factories.
D.E. Depn. fr. Labour Members on N.E. Coast – anxious tht. area shd. not be descheduled.
I so assured them. But they volunteered suggestn. tht. similar powers
shd. be available elsewhere. Unlikely therefore to be controversial.
RAB. i) Must hold our anti-inflation posn. This may seem to weaken it.
ii) No room in programme.
I.M. This is a measure wh. will help us to avoid general reflation.
H.A. Shd. have liked to mention in Budget speech.
P.M. V. well : that may whet Oppn. appetite for it – and make it easier to get it thro’
H/C.
Prepare Bill : let H.A. refer to method in B. Speech : then see prospect of getting
legn. through.
2. Pensions.
P.M. First choice : do nothing or enact some legn. next Session.
If we decide to act, three choices :-
i) require employers to provide supplementary cover, and provide State scheme
for those who aren’t covered. That won’t cure Exch. deficit.
ii) August plan.
iii) September plan. Not much object in that unless contracting-out. Asked
therefore for informn. to see how people wd. re-act to contractg-out : began with
public sector : hence C.74, which shows they will mainly want to contract out.
Need therefore to test public opinion : either by Wh. Paper or confl. discussions.
Must decide on that ques v. soon. If we decide to go on with either enquiry M/P.
cd. proceed after Easter. If we prefer to take a substantial decn. on choice of
scheme, that must wait for final decision after Easter.
H.A. Must act. Cdn’t allow things to drift, with rising deficits shown in Table A of
Ann. I. of C.71.
If we had to choose today, I wd. vote for Aug. plan. Hedge v. inflation. Lower
contn. for lower-paid. Strong preference for it.
Sept. plan. Contractg-out. If there’s little, no satisfn. If there is much, hurts
Exch. V. gt. adminve. task : clearing-house needed for watchg. transferred rights
for those who change jobs. Much, however, to be said for testing opinion re
contractg-out. Confl. consultn. cd. be justified because of no. of private schemes.
But wd. help to have a wider pol. opinion – and that cd. be better obtd. by W.
Paper method.
Drafts wd. need revision. Second, e.g., shd. present substance of both plans.
 
 
B.C. We can’t decide w’out knowing extent to wh. contractg-out wd. be used.
Therefore, tho’ for difft. reasons, I favour getting more information.
C.74 seems to be based on mistaken use of word “field”
On method of consultn. I prefer W. Paper. If we adopt other method, how do we
consult labour? T.U.C. wd. leak?
I.M. Must adhere to 2 principles : i) must ease deficit ii) must have fair alternative to
Crossman.
Table A of Annex. shows that either scheme meets test (i).
Which is the better from angle of (ii). August is tidier : just better for Ty : but not
a Tory scheme – not insurance, weighted v. young, favours lower-income groups.
Hence will be a poor version of Crossman. Therefore, if contractg-out is
practicable, Sept. has great advantages.
Method of testing opinion. Confl. consultn. Wh. Paper wd. start argument wh.
wd. tie our hands. Can avoid leaks – by consultn. with selected individuals.
M. Agree with I.M. Must have full enquiry. Dislike Aug. plan because it wd. bring
private schemes to an end. Natd. indies. : £50 M. now, wd. rise by £8.6M. under
Aug. plan. Many people wd. qualify, with suppl. pensions, for pensions almost
equal to their earnings.
H.A. Dissent from that.
M. On method of enquiry, dislike W. Paper because it commits us to too much.
Prefer to do it quietly.
Objn. to Aug. Increases costs to best employers who keep private schemes.
Employees are also near limit of reasonable contribns.
H.W. Support M. Wrong for Tory Party to abandon principle of compulsory minimum
with room to add voluntary element.
A.L.B. I too agree – for that reason.
D.E. Objects : raise more revenue &amp; counter Crossman. If we didn’t have to do
second, shd. we favour first? Is Crossman so popular now, as it was when
inflation more feared?
Value of private schemes – esp. in encouraging loyalty to firm. Sweeping them
away wd. damage industrial morale.
My choice is for no action. If we must act, prefer Sept. and enquiry by informal
consultn.
Hail. Our reputn. must rest on financial integrity. Must therefore be seen to be dealing
with emerging deficit. Must also compete with Crossman.
We must therefore act. Neither course will be popular with supporters – hastily
extending welfare State. Sept. is v. onerous to employers : if he contracts out he
has to submit to supervision and adjustment.
On contracting-out, I have developed doubts. Not sure Aug. plan will destroy
private schemes. In theory it is no diff. from present sitn. – private super-imposed
on State “floor”. Doesn’t diminish incentive because doesn’t make v. good provn.
for higher paid. Contracting-out : no right to individual : to employer/worker.
Life Offices fear Sept. more than Aug. because latter doesn’t invade much of their
field.
 
 
Tactics. Wd. have preferred Govt. decn. before any danger of leak is accepted.
But now see we can’t decide w’out enquiry. Therefore I favour enquiry – by
private consultn.
K. Prefer Sept. Enquiry by consultn.
Ch.H. Agree with I.M. But condns. for contractg-out are likely to be found v. diff. Must
therefore consult – informally.
R.M. Compr. scheme can’t be insurance : must be re-distribn. of income.
B.C. View of Life Offices is as stated by Hail. But more important to get views of
employers.
H.B. Support I.M. and M.
G.Ll. Agree with I.M. Tho’ shaken by Hail’s argument. Pension schemes valuable
now to support of investment. Wiser not to put it all in State.
D.S. We shd. support good employers. Favour Sept.
R.A.B. Propose we carry out informal consultn. But include Aug. plan in working
document. If they don’t want to contract out, they ought to see alternative.
On merits, effect of Exch. has bn. under-rated. Table A. is unduly favourable to
Sept. plan. It will involve emerging deficit, esp. after 15 yrs or so. We shd. have
a further Ty. appreciation of the figures : incldg. dispute re C.74. Remember also
tht. under Sept. plan there must be increases of contns. every 5 years.
Final decision can’t be p’poned much longer.
P.M. Sorry state of affairs due to hasty introdn. post-war of State scheme now seen to
involve intolerable cost.
Had it not bn. for that, I wd. still hanker after June plan. That wd. be genuine
insurance – with funds fruitfully invested. State schemes spend income on
current expenditure.
Powerful objns. to both Aug. &amp; Sept. Danger of Sept : in desire to protect
principle of private schemes we may in practice injure them. Transferability will,
for many employers, undermine main purpose of private schemes. The more
people who contract out, the worse it is for Exchequer : can’t therefore honestly
advocate contracting out.
Ministers must therefore reflect over Recess. M’while, we must amend Aug. &amp;
re-work figures. Also agreed estimate of contractg. out on basis of informn. in
C.74.
Then M/P. and Fin. Secy. to organise confidl. consultns. on amended working
document – consultg. M/L. on employee’s side. After that, realistic estimate of
what wd. happen on contracting-out.
Agreed as above : report to Cab. early May.
3. Legislative Programme. [Enter A.N.
R.A.B. Not all List A Bills will mature. Others will be v. short.
Crux is B.1. Also consider wtr B.1 + somethg from B2. will make a presentable
p’mme.
 
 
For a session w’out overspill we can’t add much to B.1.
J.H. x| Shall need a Bill on aid for small farms.
RAB. Wd. need to be added to B.2. Wd. have popular appeal.
K. Economic Controls. Hope to submit proposals to Cab. by July. We must clear up
Def. powers.
H.B. New Towns Bill must be done in present Parlt. High in B.2.
G.Ll. y| Church schools. This wd. need legn. – if action to be taken before an Election.
| But wd. have to be done in context of new p’mme of educational developmt.
R.A.B. x/ and y/ might be added as possibilities.
I.M. Favour Wages Councils Bill – to abolish Catering Wages!!
H.A. Hire Purchase Regn. Risk of major scandal. Cd. we have it in B.2.
D.E. In preference to Credit Trading.
H.A. Mght merge into one Bill : e.g. Credit Trading into Ec. Controls.
D.S. Reserve Forces may have to go into A., vice Extension of ’54 Acts.
RAB. Visiting Forces Amendmt. must go into B.2. (on behalf of S.Ll.)
House Ownership for persons of small means – wd. like to get Bill on that. Put it
in B.2.
