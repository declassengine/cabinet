C.M. 40 (48) 17th June, 1948

1. Parliament.

H.M. Business for next week. [Enter W.W.

A. H/L. Diffies over Nationality Bill. But expect 3rd Rdg. on Thursday.

[Enter B., H.G., G.S., J.S.

[Exit W.W.

2. Economic Affairs.

R.S.C. Labour: employed risen: unemplt down. But little headway on undermanned. June ’39 16.8: June 46: 16. ? 15.5 Sept. 47. 15.4%. Apr. ’48 15.7%. Agric. O.K. : Coal &amp; textiles bad. Bldg. 200.000 over target at end/year.

G.A.I. Other indies climbing up quicker than undermanned. 48.000 handled last month &amp; 47.000 went to 1st priority jobs w’out dirns (implying all vacancies filled).

Immobility because lack of accommodn. No job where houses &amp; no houses where jobs.

R.S.C. Switching hostels from cotton (where f. labour can’t be absorbed) to coal (where it can.)

A.B. Must adjust bldg. not to where labour needed but to where we know it can be supplied. Risk of increasg. rural housing to point above supply of farm workers.

Houses now being finished at rate of 240.000 p.a. New contracts to 180.000.

T.W. No fear of lack of farm workers to occupy houses for years to come. Want to empty hostels (gang labour) into houses (individual emplt).

A. Confirmed. Nos. living with in-laws.

A.V.A. 165.000 more in agric. now than in ’39.

T.W. Many are d.p.’s &amp; p.o.w.’s.

R.S.C. Production.

Coal: a) volume cpd. consumption.

b) propn large coal doesn’t cover home &amp; export demands.

Prodn Cttee are to consider.

190

H.G. Bit pessimistic (memo). 300.000 t. p. wk. above ’47. Some improvemt. Deep-mined may be 3m. short of target. but open-cast will be equally beyond.

Discussed with N.U.M. No hope of 1/2hr because men won’t do it. Admit Saty workg. isn’t producg. results. Some complacency – tried to shatter that by speech.

Large coal: export demand v. large cpd. our own. Gap of 60.000 t. a wk. wh. might be bridged by cuts in home consumptn.

Stock-buldg. 14.58 target last year was much exceeded.

Large coal again the problem.

E.B. Can we ask U.S. to reduce their exports of unscreened coal – for this means they ask us for nothing but large coal.

R.S.C. Am discussing this with U.K. repve of E.C.A.

[Exit C.E.

H.M. Managerial efficiency. Is industry applying results of research.

R.S.C. B.I. Managemt. getting going. Schuster Panel etc. Growing consciousness amongst younger men: but diffy. of enlisting interest of older men.

Moving everywhere: but will take time.

H.W. Re-development in Lancs. is moving now.

External Trade

R.S.C. Exports up May: shall be well above 132%.

H.W. Over 140.

R.S.C. But overtaken by rise in import prices. Excess of imports over targets is due to price not volume.

Feb/Apr. 47. Imports Feb/Apr. 48

50 fr. W. Hemisphere 34.9

31.9 fr. sterling area 35

18.1 other areas 27.1

Exports.

16.4 Western Hemisphere 17.7

47.5 Sterling area 49.9

36.1 Other areas 32.4

Substantial switch-over.

Balance of Payments.

R.S.C. Para. 25. Aprl-May were good. June will be v. bad: 70-80m.

40m. in gold in last 10 days. Total half of year (vice 220 estimate) 250/60. Due almost wholly to price factor. That means

191

250/60 deficit not counting E.R.P. We can hope (for 2nd half of 1st half year) 75m. grant &amp; 10/15 loan.

Thus can expect 80m. repaymt. Net deficit 170m for 1st half year: &amp; 2nd quarter of ’48 110m. minus 85. If therefore E.R.P. contd at same rate 25m. a quarter drain on reserves.

As we can’t afford that, we shall have to adjust import p’mme.

This a provisional warning of cuts to come.

Financial Negotiations with India &amp; Pakistan.

India wants 3 yr. agreemt. Will hold posn re blocked balances at 1/2 % . Realise that long time before they get it back. But fantastic demands for immed. releases. 650 m over 5 years in capital goods. 250m. release (50% in dollars) in next 3 years. Under instns. Can’t budge. Prob. therefore we shan’t get agreemt. They are accumulatg. sterling in free fund – have 80m. now. Don’t therefore need releases from blocked balances.

If we refuse agreemt. they may take action wh. involves extruding them fr. sterling area. That wd. be disastrous. Dollar invoicing etc.

Unrequited exports of 5-10m cd. be accepted.

Return of gold from S. Africa. 41/2m. already. Due to Malan

N.B. India haven’t drawn beyond aggreemt.

R.S.C. Can’t say yet wtr. they will keep w’in net figure.

External Trade (contd).

R.S.C. Reason: in world shortage, food, raw materials cost more than machinery etc. for which latter people can wait.

And much machinery was ordered 2 years or more ago at lower prices, while food &amp; raw materials are bought spot or a year at a time. And much of our exports are inessentials: &amp; competn has revived: we are forced to sell almost at cost to get the market.

A.B. Tribute to Dpts. for extent of switch-over. Shows how much we can manipulate controls.

A.W. Good harvest – effect?

R.S.C. Won’t yield a surplus &amp; won’t therefore break the prices. And next year we can’t eat [sic] our Argentine Rlways.

H.W. Cotton prices – trebled mainly because everyone switched fr. dollar cotton to Egyptian. Price is now falling, however.

[Exit B., G.S., and H.G.: H.W.

192

3. International Wheat Agreement.

J.S. Now looks as tho’ all countries will ratify.

If U.S. didn’t, we could get out of it.

R.S.C. Favour ratifying this. Price will prob. stay up, and this shd. therefore help us.

A.V.A. Effect of Argentine being out? Will you have to pay more for margin needed?

J.S. Hope effect will be to depress prices on free market.

Parties are obliged to buy stated quantities if price drops to minimum. And to sell at not more than maximum.

Argentine &amp; Russia remain free.

R.S.C. Max price here will influence R. prices.

J.S. Hope that good harvest will reduce wheat prices. Now 2.30.

But we are trying lower under long-term contracts. Save Australian contract at 2.70.

N.B. Can. Austr. N.Z. &amp; India likely to ratify by 31/7. S. Africa as soon as Parlt assembles. We cover Rhodesia.

Memo approved.

[Enter J.G.

4. Civil Service: Pensions for Widows etc.

R.S.C. As in memo. Overdue. Cost will grow up gradually, as cases arise.

Two points:

a) Retrospection. Can’t give it unlimited. Also 1/3rd of gratuity wd. have to be recovered. But recent cases wd. cause discontent. Option therefore to all in Service and all who were in Service between V.E. Day and date of introduction.

b) Dependants. Women can’t be left out. Many support relatives. Extend therefore to single persons of either sex in respect of a nominated relative. V. small nos. involved.

P.M. Repercussions in l. govt., educn etc.

G.T. Yes. But we shd. face them.

This is non-contributory scheme. My diffy. will be this. This scheme gives C.S. better posn than teachers. We shd. need actuarial enquiry before we cd. get clear what addl. contribn teachers wd. have to make. So m’while we shall have trouble – wh. we ought to face.

A.B. Repercussions depend on extent of addl. contribns.

193

1m. for Health Services. L. Govt. can’t estimate.

Worried more by assumption that certain classes need more than N.H.I. provides. Compn of o.a.p.’s demanded £2 a week for each (£4 for couple). This Bill wd. imply N.H.I. isn’t enough. Is it wise to launch it now?

There is something to be said re widows.

R.S.C. This isn’t innovation. Better emplts. outside provide these benefits. N.H. Act provides for supplementary schemes.

H.M. Are they universal?

R.S.C. Believe it’s about 50%.

P.M. But many are contributory.

J.G. As N.H. covers C.S. as a whole for 1st time on 5/7, this must be tested as supplementary scheme. We have taken the line that an element of contribn is essential to such a scheme.

cf industrial injuries: miners have accepted that.

May be poss. to agree tht. surrender of part gratuity = a contribution.

Widows provn in N.H. Act is quite diffr. from past. We have adopted principle that it wd. be wrong to provide pension for able bodied widow. Next principle embodied in Act.

No pension under 50 after 13 wks.

Supplementary schemes wh. conflict with N.H.I. principles are bound to have repercussions on that Act.

R.S.C. Can claim there is element of contribution (gratuity).

J.G. Cd. you convert that into an annual contribn?

R.S.C. No: for rest of C.S. superannuation is non-contributory.

A.B. That’s only an argument of convenience.

J. Are firms amending their suppl. schemes in light of N.H. scheme?

S.G. None so far have asked for more than advice. They are considerg. changes because incidence of double contribns. And this means revision downwards.

H.M. Designed form must Supern Bill – a medium Bill.

But if teachers, Police, l. government &amp; prs. Armed Forces are to be included, that will enlarge Bill. No estimate of total cost. L.A.’s will have to negotiate &amp; will claim grant. We don’t know where this may take us.

Doubt if this is general in industry.

194

General acceptance by public opinion? W. Paper on Personal Incomes. Is this consistent? Re-action fr. other clerical workers. Nor will manned worker be content that clerical worker shd. be better off.

Publicity for N.H.I. advantages.

Is this the right moment?

P.M. This shd. be framed as a supplementary scheme to N.H.I.

This memo. doesn’t indicate extent of repercussions. What of Armed Forces.

Agree with H.M. it wd. provoke much criticism in this form.

R.S.C. We are employers here - &amp; our duty to do this.

If we don’t, we shall be behind many good employers.

Policy has always bn. to be abreast of them.

P.M. V. well: but how? Must reconcile it with principles of our social policy.

R.S.C. Must be done under Superannuation Acts.

A.B. Can’t we have repercussions examd? - Ty. cd. convene mtg. of offls. of interested Dpts. to examine repercussions &amp; consider best political method of presenting it.

Salaries haven’t risen in same propn as wages. That wd. be argument in favour.

E.B. We shd. agree the principle. Our staff shd. be taken care of. But don’t be dogmatic over method. No reason why you shdn’t have annual contributions.

From F.O. angle I believe this is essential. Crying need in all overseas services.

G.A.I. Can’t it be presented as a variation of existing benefits. And choice between them.

A.W. Doctors’ are to get this benefit. Are you to w’hold it from C. servants.

Present it as a transfer of existg. benefits, not an increase.

A. Support the principle. Hard cases.

On method &amp; explore suggestions of E.B.

C.J. Re-examine scope of scheme. Some Col. servants in whose salary H.M.G. contribute.

Ty. to convene mtg. to identify repercussions &amp; consider wthr. this scheme can be reconciled with principles of N.H.I.

[Exit J.G.
