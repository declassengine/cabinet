C.M. 27(48). 8th April, 1948.

1. Parliament.

H.M. Business for next week.

2. Criminal Justice Bill: Death Penalty.

H.M. Raise again ques. of free vote for Ministers.

“Agreement to differ” in 1932 discredited Govt.

C.E. must put view as govt. view. V. awkward for Ministers to vote

against.

Respect conscientious views. But those holding them cd. abstain.

All Ministers, incldg. juniors, wd. have same right. V. serious if a

majority vote against C.E.’s view.

P.M. Wd. prefer “abstain” rule: but diff. to constrain consciences.

How are Party views?

W.W. Majority in favour of abolition.

H.M. About 50% wd. listen to argument.

A.B. Awkward if Tories carry their view v. abolition against Labour

majority.

Not a Party matter – essentially for individuals.

T.W. Freedom to abstain shd. meet the case.

E.B. Won’t it be assumed tht. those who abstain don’t support.

Wdn’t that meet conscience point.

R.S.C. Ministers needn’t attend the House if they wish to abstain.

P.M. My view: Ministers who can’t vote for, wd. be convenient if they

abstained. I won’t co-erce my colleagues.

R.S.C. If I can be in H/C. and abstain, I won’t insist on voting against.

A.B. Awkward for those who have expd strong views in past.

We can be present &amp; abstain. Will be thought therefore that they

can’t vote against but don’t want to embarrass colleagues.

Agreed: as R.S.C. proposed; but no ostentatious

abstention.

All Ministers &amp; Junior Ministers to be informed

by Chief Whip. (also L.O.’s)

[Exit W.W.

141

3. Germany: Loss of British Aircraft.

E.B. Facts as stated to H/C.

Wreckage suggests fighter struck liner from above. That doesn’t bear

out R. excuses.

Wrote lr. to Sokolovsky. He has not replied; &amp; looks as if no

assurances will be given.

Asked for 4 Power enquiry because 4 Power flight avenue. R. reject,

and say Anglo-Soviet only.

Will cause diffies with U.S. (who had 2 passengers killed) &amp;

French.

I didn’t publish Robertson’s letter – to avoid argument. But now mean

to publish all corrce because Sov. has sent tendentious reply.

Propose agree to Angl-Sov. enquiry if U.S. and Fr. are associated with

it in some way, as assessors.

Don’t want this confused with non-mtg. of Control Council.

Afraid we are in for usual arguments re procedure etc., - put up with

intention of playing out time.

4. Germany: Traffic into Berlin.

E.B. Suspension mil. passenger trains. Other transport (casuals, freight

trains etc.,) now normal. R. claiming however to examine pp. of

passengers in mil. trains – alleging smuggling etc., to have bn.

going on. Daresay it has bn., in spite of my warnings.

Have tried to damp this down. Don’t want big row over trifles.

Enquired re Vienna. There all 4 have agreed to controls wh. are

v. much same as R. proposals for Berlin.

R. may have quite a plausible case. Trouble really is their method

of asserting it.

P.M. Trouble arises from lack of clear written agreement.

Gentleman’s agreement. Monty’s over-simplification.

In Vienna they were more businesslike.

5. Austria.

E.B. Hanging on to get Treaty. After Czechosl. development some

thought wise to keep Allied troops in Austria. But serious

risks in this. R. have bn. arming cells in Austria – much as they

did in Czechosl. And can do it easily under protn of R. Armies.

And Austr. Govt. can take no counter-action because they can’t

get arms. If we supplied arms to democrats, it wd. be all set for

civil war – wh. wd. play into R. hands.

Sent Strang to Vienna – to check up on repns made to me by Austrian

politicians. He advised reliance on M/Interior: sound, strong,

controls Police. Strang advises to get Treaty &amp; remove troops.

Leave Govt. to cope.

142

Pressed on therefore with Treaty. R. have come down to 150 m. $.

We might pay that price to get them out.

Main ques. therefore = oil. Fact is B. cos. didn’t develop these

assets before Auschluss. Went ahead then, at Hitler’s behest.

This is awkward vis-à-vis R.

R. in effect claims all Austrian oil. We had therefore to fight

for B. rights, as British under 1930 concessions. Now reduced

to a reasonable division. R. claim reduced to 30 years.

May get settlement on this.

Frontier ques. remain.

Arms. R. claim only arms made in Austria = none!

Not out of wood yet: but better prospects than ever before.

W’drawal of R. troops from Austria means removal of R. troops from

all Balkan countries. For only these qua l/c to Austria. Then

only in Poland for l/c to Germany.

U.S. authies are now in line with this.

A.V.A. Dangers when troops w’draw.

Removal of Soc. Democrats from W. Zones. And arming of cells.

Set-to between Austrian Communists &amp; Soc. Democrats may well

lead to Comm. victory.

H.M. Economically viable?

E.B. Trying for Customs Union with Italy.

A.B. Admit risk mentioned by AVA. But risks the other way are greater.

6. Finland.

E.B. Finnish/Soviet pact has been signed. Treaty itself is, however,

v. moderate. Basis = Finland is a neutral buffer State.

This is less than original Soviet demand for full political

assocn and base facilities.

Will circulate text of Treaty for informn.

7. Italy.

E.B. Action taken has heartened Italian Govt. They seem to have better

grip of position.

Blum has gone to Italy.

Chances 60 : 40 against Comm., when we last considered it.

Now looks more like 70 : 30.

J. Nenni thought he &amp; Togl. wd. get 47%. de Gasperi said 35%.

Everyone thought Comm. were makg. no headway in the north;

but going well in backward south by reason of irresponsible

143

promises - &amp; failure of Govt. to develop progressive agrarian

policy.

E.B. R.C. Church is the trouble – as landlord.

[Enter G.S., C.K., Stewart.

8. Steel Scrap.

G.S. As in memo.

After a short discussion – of which no note taken by me –

Memo. approved.
