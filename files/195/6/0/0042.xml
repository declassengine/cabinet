C.M. 46(48). 1st July, 1948.

1. Germany.

E.B. Mtgs. with U.S. &amp; Fr. y’day. Cttee estd here. Going into supply

ques. to-day on that body.

Draft note to R. submd by U.S. Will have to go to Ministerial Cttee.

Form seems to expose us as did Bedell Smith’s note. Wd raise

whole G. issue. Draft submd also to French.

Mtg. with Ministers President in F’furt to-day.

U.S. want v. lengthy note for benefit of their public opinion. I prefer

shorter note: may have to have separate approaches.

Moreover doubt if we shd. by-pass our local people: may be better

to insist it goes back to Berlin Council &amp; failing agreemt.

to C.F.M.

M-King’s statement promising concentrated foods. Believe we

may reach total air lift of 3.500 t. p. diem – as cpd. with

5.000 before.

One train went thro’ y’day. May be better not to raise it at once to

Govt. level. Anyhow, better to wait until air lift is at maximum.

No foundation for Press statement re balloons. McNeil stressed in

debate responsibility of Press in critical times. Am enquiring

into source – Reuters?

Situation likely to ease off. Advantages therefore of delaying note for

a day or so.

2. Palestine.

E.B. Haven’t seen Bernadolte’s proposals – commd only to J &amp; A = but

believe this is takg. shape.

But serious trouble among Jews. There may be serious civil war

betwn. Hagana/Stern &amp; Irgun before State is established.

Told Dow to keep in touch with Tel-a-Viv; &amp; inform us.

3. Yugoslavia.

E.B. Looks as tho’ there will be recantn or a stand-up on claim for Balkan

fedn (Dimitrov &amp; Tito). In spite of quarrels among themselves,

won’t ease our problem in Greece. R. wants to control Greece

in order to get behind Turkey: they won’t accept offer (still

standg) to discuss Montreux Convention. Failed up to now in

Greece. Tito always thought they wd: &amp; preferred to try by

splitting off Macedonia. He and Dimitrov have preferred

Balkan Fedn to get an outlet to south.

217

4. Parliament.

Business for next week.

H/Lords Business.

J. B. Naty Bill. Must be no weakening in H/C.

P.M. N.B. shd. be in H/C.

N.B. Asked if we wd. issue W. Paper to show how H/L. were wrong.

H.M. Speech wd. suffice.

E.R.P. Agreemt. is to be signed Tues. night. Debate in H/L. now

arranged for Tuesday p.m.

Exit A.

Enter J.G., H.G., G.B.

5. Supplementary Injuries Scheme for Miners.

G.B. As in memo. Not genuinely contributory.

Extreme diffy = £2 a week for life for widow of 30 – as cpd. with

principle of other schemes that a young widow shd. seek own

livelihood.

Have tried from outset to resist general increase in war pensions.

But can’t hold it if these benefits are vouchsafed to miners.

J.G. “Miners will only bear 1/8th of cost.” Not as bad as that. In fact

1/6th, if 4d a ton is paid on saleable coal.

Admit the disparities re widows. They were there before – for war

widows already had pension for life. And children of war

pensioners get allowances in duplicn – 2nd child gets 16/= a wk.

Larger families will be better off.

All comparisons here are with rates for privates. Flat rate in

other schemes. Shdn’t suppress, in comparisons, higher rates

for n.c.o.’s &amp; officers.

N.H.I. adopts new principle of encouraging young widow to replace

herself in life. But war widow isn’t required now to do that.

Nor is widow now under W. Comp. Act.

P.M. War widows disappear by efflux of time. This is permanent.

H.M. M/P. memo = powerful. We are up against it. Diffies of Govt. over

cash payments. Don’t see what answer M/P. can give – esp. as

the war pensioners were conscripted.

If we concede w. pensions increase, there will be repercussions on

ordinary N.H.I.

Might resist repercussions if miners contd 50%.

D.J. R.S.C. thinks respons. shd. rest with N.C.B.

V. diff. if we accept respons. &amp; then alter w. pensions in consequence.

218

Anomalies betwn. miner &amp; war pensioner cd. be used against

anomalies betwn. w. pensioner &amp; ordinary industrial

pensioner.

T.W. Conscriptn. Miners were equally forced to stay in miners.

H.G. Can’t ignore the past. All the anomalies mentioned by M/P. arise

as soon as you have any supplementary scheme at all.

Benefits must be better if it’s a supplementary scheme.

Miner’s widows ratio. S.I.M. have never objected to that.

Discn has always turned on contn. And at last Cab. we decided not

to insist on 50% &amp; so informed N.C.B.

Potteries: 4d a wk. fr. each side wd. prob. give you these benefits.

Can’t get them in mines w’out much higher contn from

employers.

My respons., can be argued, is limited to seeing justice done as

betwn. difft. classes of miners.

If I refuse, they will come to No. 10. Will you then give way?

Natd indies: are we going to take responsibility or not?

Diffy of ‘guiding’ Boards in background.

E.B. Employers’ contn of 1/8th as against 4d is a bit too much.

A.B. As against civilian widow you cd. hold posn on basis of mining being

a special case: But not as against war pensions.

E.B. Risk in mining (if self-contd fund) justifies departing from 50/50 basis.

But not so far as 1/8th and 4.

P.M. Why shd. the benefits be so high?

H.G. We didn’t negotiate the terms.

E.B. But you cd. have influenced them.

A.B. Don’t dodge implications of own decns. Miners wd. know if we

influenced N.C.B. We have ignored the financial

irresponsibility of Boards.

The principle of m’taing. young widow for life was first introduced

in war pensions.

Believe we cd. get it across miners that we can’t defend diffce between

miner’s widow and war widow.

H.D. Last time we were inclined to accept. Now to reject.

Don’t like some features. May be right to re-open ques. with miners.

But be careful. Govt. policy = make mining attractive. If

contributory element were sounder we cd. stand for this genl. run

of benefits.

219

T.W. Was as good as settled last time.

N.U.M. are under impn this scheme is nearly thro’, &amp; have

announced it.

H.G. It is agreed betwn. N.C.B. &amp; N.U.M.

Awaits Ministerial approval.

H.M. Can contn be adjusted to cover cost of addl. benefit for widows.

Or can that benefit be adjusted.

J.G. This was included in Miners Charter – at a much higher level &amp;

w’out contn.

I tried for 1d per £1. That = 7d. 50% wd. be 1/=.

Modifn in widow’s benefit wdn’t affect contn v. much.

A.W. Danger of leavg. ex Service popn under impn they are being dealt

with unfairly in comparison with others.

Can’t the miners be made to understand that?

Wider repercussions eg. o.a.p.

H.G. Accident rate justifies higher contn by employers.

E.B. Cost can’t go on price for ever: will in the end come on wages when

foreign competn makes itself felt.

Miner’s widow. Remember it’s a self-contd community. If she has

to earn her living she will have to leave her village. That wd.

at least warrant extendg. 13 weeks.

J.G. Ordinary ind. injury scheme: widow gets pension for life.

H.G. Stressed that fact. 2) War pensions: shd. you compare with private’s

rates only? And children &amp; rent allowances are better for war

widows.

It is only the young childless widow wh. is open to awkward compn.

P.M. Everyone will fasten on that.

J.G. Procedure: H.G. to N.C.B. I informally to Miners’ leaders.

We haven’t intervened officially at all. What do we do now?

H.G. Send for both sides openly: say we don’t like [Exit G.B.

the widow anomaly: not worth mentioning the contn.

N.B. Wdn’t be right to ask miners for more than 4d.

We shd. act on our old view that miners shd. have a better deal.

A.B. Shd. discuss contn also. Demonstrate the dangers of applying a

4d contn in other industries. To warn the miners.

On learning results, we shd. at once consider repercussions on war

pensions etc.

220

E.B. I would w’hold approval for the provn re widows.

H.G. Agree: can’t re-open whole case.

E.B. My view { no supplemn at all for young childless widow.

{ limit supplemn to widows with children.

A.B. i.e. decline to approve provn for childless widow.

And avoid going into all the other points.

P.M. Summed up on this basis.

Agreed.

[Exit A.W., H.G., W.W., J.G.

6. Steel Scrap. [Enter G.S. and H.

G.S. a) Germany. Gt. anxiety. Can’t yet judge effect of currency

reform – hope it may ease sitn.

U.S. demand for scrap. Tactically correct to agree she shd. have some.

But strong lobby now in U.S. Illogical tht. they shd. have so

much when they are giving E.R.P. For this is what Europ.

recovery depends on.

E.B. is pressing U.S. on this.

E.B. Waste of scrap in G. steel works. Will send to M/S. report I have recd

on this. We shd. together press them on this if M/S. experts

confirm.

G.S. No doubt there is ample scrap in G.

E.B. Douglas agrees it’s madness to ship it to U.S. But can’t move the

lobby – election year.

H.M. Supported the 4 points in memo. What has E.B. done with

U.S. Govt?

E.B. 300.000 t. allocd to U.K. etc., para. 10 of memo.

Assume M/S. will arrange to get the 300.000 t.

G.S. Can’t get a seller.

H.D. Then F.O. thro’ Control Commn must help.

G.S. No power to requisition.

E.B. By quadripartite decision.

P.M. Why shdn’t we do it – as R. have always done.

221

E.B. U.S. won’t do it: and prob. wdn’t agree.

A.B. Discussed ad nauseam. Always told remedy was to

introduce currency reform. Now we have got that, it wd. be

mistaken to go back to requisitioning.

P.M. Who approaches G. merchants?

G.S. Subsidiary of Steel Board.

E.B. Wish G.S. wd. go into this personally.

P.M. M/S. must act in close concert with F.O. &amp; Control Commn.

G.S. Wait 3 weeks to see effect of currency reform.

P.M. Not too long.

A.B. Also organise scrap merchants. [Enter C.E.

E.B. Will G.S. come &amp; see me at F.O.? (!!)

H.M. And cd. Franks be asked to explain posn in W’ton.

E.B. Must think: its pockets, not heads.

[A.V.A. Disposal of A.F.V.’s]

N.B. Try to push U.S. into Pacific.

H.W. Let R.S.C. enlist Harriman’s suppt.

b) Graham Cunningham Report.

G.S. All action practicable is being taken.

A.V.A. True. Rpt. of Genl. Geak. recd &amp; is satisf.

But under speeding up of surplus decln, much will be cleared wh. is

quite useful. Suppose we have to “fight with what we can”.

Or supply Benelux etc. Awkward to supply others while we

scrap our own.

If we have to delay decln on that a/c, margin will be even larger.

P.M. Bring to Def. Cttee.

E.B. And m’while stand still on any increased rate of disposal.

H. 35 ships (incldg. 5 b’ships) handed over since 1.1.48.

2 left. Leaves enormous gap in scrap supply in 1949/50.

H.D. Colln of industrial scrap. Cd. Reg. Bds. do more? 222

G.S. Blitz put on wh. has put up colln fr. 70 to 90.000 tons p.m.

H.W. Concln re scrap prices. Considered only in reln to incentive for

merchants. But incentive to industry to scrap &amp; replace

equipmt. Cotton wd. scrap quicker if scrap prices were

higher. Hope G.S. will reconsider this.

G.S. All my advice is price increase wdn’t bring in another ton.

Case for higher price for remote scrap (to cover transport).

Wd put up steel price. Wd be unfair to those who have given

up scrap. And comg. in v. fast. Will consider on B/T. request

differential price increase for cotton.
