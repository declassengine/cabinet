C.M. 24 (48) 22nd March, 1948

1. Criminal Justice Bill.

[Enter W.W.

Bring up after Easter.

2. Parliament.

E.B. Wd. prefer not to go on with Palestine Bill, in view of U.S. initiative.

H.M. We &amp; Opposn wanted to get Bill thro’ quickly. Back-benchers promised not to obstruct. Wd. like to push it thro’ on Tuesday.

C.J. They can raise on Cl. 1. what will happen after 15/5.

C.E. Deferring it wd. imply we were willing to stay on in Palestine.

E.B. V. well: ram it through.

Resolution.

H.M. R.S.C. want me to take this as Leader of H/C.

Case for view tht. Dept. Minister shd. do it. Cd. M/H. handle it?

P.M. He is ill.

R.S.C. Financial Secy. cd. take it. If I do, people will suspect some sinister financial purpose.

Agreed: Fin. Secy. + A.G.

Business after Easter.

H.M. Statement on Business to include promise tht. Budget debate will continue on Mon. &amp; Tues. of following week.

Communists in Govt. Service.

H.M. Reasonable time on Thurs. shd. suffice.

P.M. Had hoped to submit memo. to Cab. to-day re procedure.

Shall answer shortly to-day, promising debate on Thursday.

Shall say when dismissal is in ques. will go to Cttee of 3 presided over by retired Civil Servant &amp; Minister will then decide.

R.S.C. Can person appear in person? Will have to be considered.

J. Cd. normally be in writing – not excluding personal appearance in exceptional case.

128

P.M. Must avoid independent outside Tribunal.

Spokesmen on Thursday – P.M. R.S.C. to reply if required.

Debate on Consolidated Fund Bill

C.E. On 3rd Rdg. – Police to 7pm &amp; C. Defence after.

I intended to take first. But J.A. spkg. on 2nd ques. &amp; it is suggested Under Secy. won’t suffice in reply. I don’t want to spk. twice: &amp; I dissent from “right” of Opposition to choose Govt. spokesmen.

3. Political Activities of Civil Servants.

P.M. Philip Morris can’t act as Chairman of Cttee.

Propose J.C. Masterman – Provost of Worcester.

[Exit W.W.

4. Publication of Diplomatic Documents.

E.B. If published in chronol. order documents of 1938/39 wdn’t be publd until 1953. Or 1951 if we begin now at 1930.

Won’t be out for 6-12 months.

Agreed: publish 1938/39 out of sequence.

5. Western Union: Foreign Affairs.

E.B. Trying to get an organisation going. Diffies with French. But much impressed with Benelux countries – steadier and more confident.

Risk of excessive U.S. pressure on France. Have warned Marshall.

Will submit memoranda on

a) organisation under new Treaties.

b) C.E.E.C. France did well.

Truman’s declaration. I had no previous warning. Not much I cd. do. Have asked Marshall what it means in practical detail.

Italy. Not certain Gaspers’ will get majority in elections.

They have concentrated on north &amp; will do better there.

But Comm. m’while have gone all out in the South.

There the movement is mainly Italian, not so much Russian inspired. Influence of R.C. Church in supportg. land-owners v. peasants. land hunger is main problem.

Trieste. was raised in this connection. Tried to implement Treaty.

If Govr. had been appd we cd. have got troops out in 4 mos.

Now 9 mos. have passed. R. blocked it, unless we. wd. assent to apptmt. of R. stooge.

4 Power Commn in Ital. Colonies. R. announced recently they wd. support return to Italy.

129

To counter this electioneering move, I thought we were free to say we wd. support return of Trieste to Italy. We therefore made that announcement.

Promised Parlt. to bring own troops home in 4 mos.

Hope Cab. will approve announcemt.

We know R. intended to announce on 6/4 that they were willing to support return of Trieste town to Italy.

Don’t propose to make statement in H/C. unless asked for it.

H.M. Believe this is right on merits.

Sorry Press are takg. it solely as electioneering move.

D. Telegraph went so far as to say it was to forestall R. offer.

6. Palestine.

E.B. U.S. now seeing what they shd. have seen before they supported Partition. They assumed we wd. enforce in the end.

M’while, they have allowed R. to ship in.

This comes from allowing U.S. electoral needs to influence U.S. f. policy.

They are now back where we were a year ago.

Truce? Who cd. enforce it? Stern Gang &amp; Irgun wd. carry on with terrorism.

U.S. request for special Session of Genl. Assembly will prob. be vetoed by R. If they then try a procedural vote, may be diff. for us to abstain.

U.S. motive.

a) Apprehensions of Arab resistance.

b) U.S.- Turkish talks have bn. procdg. Point has apparently bn. made tht. U.S. have opened a gap in their strategic rear.

c) Democrats have lost N. York Vote. Truman seeking to replace it by anti–R. Vote. Not now trying to conciliate Zionist Vote.

d) If U.S. troops went to Pal. &amp; some were killed, pogroms wd. start in U.S.

No chance of Trusteeship being accepted – or of any agreemt.

Latest idea of enforcemt. = Fr. U.S. &amp; B. I have said tht. after Lebanon Fr. troops wdn’t be acceptable = &amp; troubles wd. arise in N. Africa. Said, too, we wdn’t stay after May 15. Appeal to reconsider that: but can’t see how we can.

Next move: Jews will prob. establ. a State in some area.

Then immigration &amp; our action? My feeling: if they do it, we shd. do nothg. to check it. But what will Arabs then do? Convinced Abdullah will put troops into parts of Pal. wh. Jews can’t hold. That will mean a row among Arab States. But don’t think we shd. use B. troops to check this developmt. of events.

‘Nature’ may partition Palestine.

130

C.J. U.S. announcement will strengthen R. influence in J. Agency &amp; among J. in Pal.

Jews will expedite attempts to assume authy in their part of Pal. – prob. smaller part.

J. will press on with immigration.

Truce or Trusteeship – will require as big an Army as we have now in Pal. If a Trust were agreed, diff. for us to refuse to make our contribn to enforcemt. troops.

Must adhere m’while to our dates.

Advance guard of Pal. Commn: have reported in alarmist way: advising Commn not to go out till last moment.

Think now Commn may resign.

Transfer fr. Cyprus can begin when time is ready.

P.M. Can we get our troops out before 1/8? Shd. expedite.

A.V.A. Evacuation going well. Will enquire.

E.B. Sooner the better. There will be fighting. Better we shd. be out.

P.M. Stand firm on 15/5. date. Clear troops as soon as poss. thereafter.

Mil. evacuation was based on assumptn of handing over power.

If 2 States are going to establish themselves &amp; we aren’t going to intervene on any view, our troops shd. get away – in case they become involved. Danger of 2nd Gordon incident.

A.V.A. We cd. re-enforce if our men were trapped in Jerusalem.

E.B. Shd. have Transport Command planes available in Egypt.

P.M. C.O.S. shd. re-consider in light of this development.

Agreed. C.O. shd. consider concentration of civilian staffs also.

Can abandon adminn from now on.

C.J. We have done all we can to safeguard future of Holy Places in Jerusalem – both locally and in Trusteeship Council. Nothing effective done by U.N.

Likely no Govr. apptd by May 15.

Terrorist Prisoners. Pressure to bring to U.K. or B. territory.

P.M. No. No legal basis for that. Leave them.

[Enter L.S.

7. Development Values: Payment of Professional Fees.

R.S.C. As in memo.

No other solution if plan is to be carried thro’.

P.M. Convinced by this memo.

131

[Exit L.S.

8. Monopolistic Practices Bill.

[Enter J.S., C.K., B., G.S., H.G.

H.M. Summarised main points in C.P. 93.

Exclusive of transport.

H.M. Only on basis tht. public corpns are all excluded.

Cdn’t justify it qua transport.

B. If B. Transport Commn manufactured, it wd. be w’in scope of Commm. My case is tht. Minister has powers: Tribunal for fares &amp; ratio: discriminn re services, there is consultative Cttees.

P.M. Shipping?

B. I agreed to L.P. Cttee tht. shd. not be covered. For – a) Cd. apply only to Conference lines decns. In fact there is competition betwn. these lines.

b) Geneva organn can deal with restrictive practices.

c) Comm. Shipping Cttee can handle any such ques. limited to B. companies.

P.M. No guarantee tht. a) will continue.

Wd. b) or c) cover coastal shipping?

B. No.

P.M. Others wd. claim they don’t practice monopoly, in practice.

R.S.C. Real point = main shipping points wd. be international &amp; we wd. be drawn into using our domestic law to enforce internatl shipping cartel agreemts.

Agreed.

H.W. Substantial proportion. I wd. have preferred it. But risk of trouble with the courts. Also v. clumsy draft.

Now favour criterion of 1/3rd.

Have 38 cases wh. I shd. want to refer. All these are over 1/2 &amp; many are much higher proportion.

One third puts Co-ops. right out of it – with possible exception of flour.

J. Who determines the 1/3rd?

H.W. If it “appears to B/T.”

A.V.A. Cl. 3., covering supply, will let Co-ops in under 1/3rd formula.

132

Don’t ask tht. Co-op be excluded. It’s a ques. of defining the public interest. Co-op can’t be against public interest for any citizen can join w’out premium.

H.W. They are safe under this Bill.

And we shall refer to Commn a no. of cases in wh. others are now discriminatg. against Co-ops.

J. Two attractive points in A.V.A.’s Bill. a) Power to put a firm “on probation” – makg. reports etc. Govt. Bill may enable this by administration but B/T now specifically empowered.

H.W. I can cover this point in adminn easily.

J. b) Much more care to prevent injustice to individual.

Procedure provided for more discussion over form of order.

R.S.C. But all this is now done by a Commn.

J. Real strength not in orders made.

H.M. Let. H.W. consider between now &amp; Cttee stage provn allowg. those affected to match repns before Order made.

H.W. Will consider a) and b) before Cttee stage.

A.V.A. Wd. have liked to show Bill to Co-op lawyers.

P.M. After publication of Bill.

[Exit C.K., J.S. and G.S.

9. Petrol Rationing.

H.G. Appalling Diffies of adminn and enforcement of present system. No prospect of improving this w’out vast increase of staff.

Attitude of public. As for parking offences pre-war.

Or Prohibition in U.S.

On other hand. savings have bn. considerable. We shd. continue those. Tried therefore to find means of amelioratg. posn w’out increased consumption.

Black-market. Must close leak before any basic is restored. And wd. make an absolute economy.

10% cut in commercial. Para. 7. That is not an additional saving. Can’t count it as well as economies from black-market restns.

E &amp; S allowances. No simple means of squeezing out surplus. Think no more than 20.000 t. p.a.

Plan – as in memo.

Many people do use cars on S. allowances for only 90 m. p. month.

Propose rebate system on Road Fund licence.

133

Standard allowance = new principle. Wise to start afresh now, anyway.

Want public support. Motoring organisns want to make peace with us. Hence propose Cttee.

S. coupons to be rapidly variable.

Can’t produce satisfying scheme at 30% of pre-war consumption. Believe this will be welcomed.

P.M. Weakest part of plan = abandoning stiff penalties proposed by Vick Cttee. You must say you rely on gettg. petrol out of black-market. You can plead that. And Opposn cdn’t make diffies therefore wd. delay getting standard allowances.

H.M. Cdn’t. it be done under S &amp; Services Bill?

Favour this:

a) nationally important to kill this black market.

b) cd. make it clear tht. unless House gives you this Bill they can’t have more basic petrol.

J. Agree – we shdn’t do the petrol coupon rate.

R.S.C. Will Benches enforce these penalties?

P.M. Shd. be done by fresh Bill, not D.R. to get us up to date expn of Parlt. views – in order to get courts to enforce.

H.W. Some penalties might be applied automatically.

C.E. Want H.O. to look at penalties.

Wd. like them as severe as poss. But points to be considered e.g. effect of Prob. Act.

Proposals approved, subject to this.

[Exit B. &amp; H.G.

10. Paper for “Action”.

H.W. Memo submitted because Action now published.

R.S.C. Awkward if ques. is raised in H/C.

C.E. Are you actionable for not carrying out terms of your own Order?

H.W. They are entitled to paper: but I’m not obliged to grant a licence.

J. Awkward if you can be mandamus - cd.
