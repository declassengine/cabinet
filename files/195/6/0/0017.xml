94

P.M. Scrap.

G.S. Decn of Cab. to appoint w. party of officials. After consultn with

R.S.C. have departed from this –

a) awkward to get officials to go over work of Steel Bd. More

effective also to have 3 outside people – G. Cunningham,

k. Loch, Dr Slade.

b) Rpt. was to cover pig-iron as well as scrap. Steel Bd. have all

knowledge on pig-iron. The Cttee of 3 will do scrap &amp; their Rpt.

will include memo. by Steel Bd. on pig-iron.

Posn is serious. Boils down to Germany – commercial Scrap. Cttee

of 3. to go at once to G. &amp; go into this as matter of urgency.

P.M. Delay = G. scrap merchants’ reluctance to accept marks.

G.S. Booty scrap we are getting. We have no title to comm. scrap.

U.S. will co-operate now, but don’t know what to do.

A.W. Confiscation wdn’t solve it. Need G. labour to do it.

P.M. Take it &amp; give G. workers food vice money.

T.W. Price?

G.S. Partly: it’s a low figure. But mainly because they don’t believe

marks have any value.

P.M. Take it; and deal with scrap merchants later.

R.S.C. Prob. have to handle it like N. German Timber Control.

E.B. Consult F.O. when Rpt. of 3 is available.

A.B. Pig-iron. Is the industry using capacity to maximum.

G.S. Steel Bd. advice (incldg. both sides of industry) is tht. industry is

doing 100%. Sure there’s room for some improvement here and

there: but in general posn seems to be satisfactory.

H.W. India has offered pig-iron in return for steel. We may get agreement

on that.

E.B. G. can produce more steel. Told Robertson we will take it.

Doubt if we’ve put same drive into steel as into coal.

Agreed: major priority &amp; all possible to be done.

A.B. Appln of standards of tensile strengths. Too heavy a safety

margin. Shd. revert to war-time 10 vice pre-war 8. tons.

R.S.C. B.S.I. have bn. considering for 12 months. Must hurry them up.

95

A.B. Lower standard wd. economise substantially. Wd. save 250.000 tons

of steel.

Can Supplies &amp; Services Act be used to enforce modifn of standard?

R.S.C. Can only do it via B.S.I. For their standard is imported

automatically by Surveyors etc.

G.S. Will announce appointmt of Cttee of 3 on Monday.

H.M. Export/Import Gap. Increased in Jan.

R.S.C. Due to price increases.

A.W. Textile exports cpd. with pre-war.

H.W. Rising fast – at last.

E.B. Foreign Labour. Wd. Italian girls do?

G.A.I. Diffies with It. Govt. Haven’t exhausted other sources.

E.B. Artists in pottery. Cd. we recruit small nos. Wd. help Italy, who have

no outlet for emigratn.

H.W. Helpful suggn qua pottery. Wd. like to consider it.

More decorators in Potteries wd. expand exports.

Agreed: M/L. and B/T. to consider &amp; report to F.O.

H.W. Finland. No dollars (in spite of 1947 pledge). More timber than

we asked for. But much bigger price - £47.10.0. asked vice 40.

Decided to leave it open because repercussions.

A.B. Can we review sources of plywood. Cd. then export houses.
