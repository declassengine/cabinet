C.M. 3(48). 13th January, 1948.

1. Fats Ration. [Enter J.S.

J.S. Important. Potatoes look bad.

Can do the fats – clearly until April &amp; thereafter if Danish

negotns go well.

Not a large calory increase: but will enable more bread to be eaten.

Fulfils policy of getting more from non-dollar sources.

P.M. Cd. you do this even w’out Argentine supplies?

J.S. Yes – from stocks, until Apl.

R.S.C. Do this: but no commitment after April yet &amp; announce as tempy

increase out of stocks as near to Feb. as possible.

This will be helpful to us in negotns with Danes.

J.S. Must give a fortnight’s notice. Otherwise, I agree with R.S.C.

R.S.C. V. well: but hold until next Mon. if you can, viz., announce on

last day enablg. introdn on 1/2 &amp; explain in advance to Danes.

H.M. Specially worded announcement on B.B.C.

2. Allocation of Resources. [Exit J.S.

[Enter D.J., C.K., B., H.G.

R.S.C. As in memo.

A.B. Content – discussing labour this p.m.

P.M. Statement in v. woolly, needs clarification.

A. 4th para. Why “now” necessary to expend exports?

R.S.C. Because P.M.L. didn’t extend to exports.

H.M. Para. 3. “favoured by mild autumn.” Unwise challenge to weather!

P.M. Stress natural change in developing situation.

T.W. Amendments to C/Exch.

[Exit D.J., C.K., B.

3. Gas Bill.

H.G. Much in common with Electricity. Main difference = give Area

Boards more power because no centralised generation.

18

Areas discussed fully with industry.

S.I.M. proposed apptmt “after consultn with S. of S.”. Parly. Counsel

objected to this, on constitutional grounds. cf. Sc. Board.

Gas Council. One function will be to examine cap. developmt.

But no power to over-rule Area Bds.

Area Bds. Full-time Chairman &amp; Vice-Chairman. But left at

large in Bill.

Not in favour of functional Bd. Favour remaining members

part-time. But want scope for further experiment.

Diff. views &amp; people changing views.

Full-time members tend to become functional.

Shall prob. recommend changes in N.C.B. – away from the

functional basis.

Don’t want to be tied down on this.

P.M. Must have a view by 2nd Rdg.

H.G. Shall start with Chairman &amp; Vice Chairman whole time. But must

reserve right to modify in light of experience.

General support for that view.

A.V.A. Centralised prodn of coke - oven gas?

H.G. x/ Power for N.C.B. to work out such schemes with Area Bds. &amp; submit to Minister.

H.G. Gas Council. Will be national advisory body. But main function = central financing body for industry. Central Guarantee Fund:

Area Bds. autonomous unless they draw on that: then they

must conform to dirns by Council on financial behaviour.

We here take over non-statutory undertakings – large no. of small

ones. In electricity we allowed them option.

Coke ovens. Final decn with N.C.B. is at x/. [Enter A.W.

In default of agreemt., Minister can require each party to

submit scheme &amp; may impose one of his own. And, after

enquiry, he may take over, with special Parly. procedure.

Consumer protn – much as in electricity. Price control via control

of dividends won’t now apply. Hence Consumer Council.

Provn in Bill for Minister to refer their complaints to

independent referee.

Compensation. a) Severance. £5 m. for electricity. Propose £2 m. for

gas.

b) Dissipation of Assets before Vesting Date. Some

electricity undertakgs. (municipal) have bn. doing this via

rebates. Propose not to provide for it in this Bill. Do it first for

electricity by Order of basis of things actually done: then amend

Gas Bill.

c) Redundancy. Similar provns in Elect. &amp; Transport

Acts. But stat. protn for gas employees (via private Acts) were

less comprehensive. H.M. therefore thinks we shd. not go so

19

far – esp. re worsening of condns. I think differences (between

this &amp; other Acts on this) will involve us in serious diffies in

Unions. Think therefore we must have same provn in Bill.

Doesn’t commit us to same Regs. Room to discuss with Unions

e.g. diff. treatment for diff. classes of employee.

R.S.C. Policy h’to = follow practice of industry. None in gas for worsening

of condns. If we expand this, steel workers will want the same &amp;

we shall have no ground for resistg. it. Can stand, up to now, on

basis merely continuing past stat. practice. If we go beyond that,

can we resist demands from miners, lorry drivers etc.?

H.G. There was some provn in private Acts, but didn’t extend to worsening

of condns.

A.B. I’ve resisted this kind of thing in L. Govt. Act, N. Health etc. How

can I go on resistg. it in my field (with more precedents for

giving way) while Ministers nationalising in industrial field

chuck these concessions away.

H.M. Agree with R.S.C. &amp; A.B. We must resist T.U. pressure on this.

Precedents in L. Govt., Ldn. Transport etc. are v. fierce.

Must set our face v. applying those precedents in wider field.

Dangers of people working a racket over this. Salaried even more

than workers.

Stat. protn under Rlways Act – M/T. wanted to extend that to road

employees. We stopped him because of repercussions on

e.g. miners.

Apart fr. money involved, we don’t want to encourage mood that

no-one can be asked to change his job w’out compensn.

G.A.I. Agree with H.M. Dangers of letting this spread.

Shdn’t go beyond continuing existg. statutory protection.

A.B. What about re-grouping pits – if this were conceded to miners.

P.M. Then, if you are going to stand on this line, you must be firm.

A.V.A. In opposition, we have always backed T.U.C. in demanding this.

A.B. Not always. I was against it on Electricity Acts.

G.T. Was there any extension of state. protn in El. Act?

H.G. Not in form.

Agreed: no extension. H.G. to inform T.U.C.

P.M. What of dissipn of resources?

H.G. Can prohibit rebates: diff. to prevent them fr. keeping prices down

20

when they shd. be raised. Am discussing with Ty.

A. Powers of Minister as cpd. with Council &amp; Bds.

Para. 4 (c) &amp; (d) of memo. Doesn’t this leave Minister v.

isolated. What powers will he have under para. 2. &amp; on whose

advice will he exercise them? Who has a say on tariffs?

A matter for Bds. unless Minister intervened?

Shd. there not be a buffer to advise Minister on these issues?

P.M. Consultative Councils. And Minister can consult Gas Council.

H.G. And complaints by Consult. Council may be referred by Minister to

independent Referee.

H.M. On price-fixing this Bill follows Electricity Bill.

Agree we haven’t finished with ques. of consumer protn on price.

Don’t want all socialised indies on exactly same pattern. Here was

opportunity for more de-centralisation: right to try it.

Chairman of Gas Council will be independent person.

A.B. Don’t like this policy of takg. industries out of private hands &amp; passg.

them back to statutorily irresponsible Boards.

J. Minister’s strength is power to give general directions &amp; power to

sack the Bd.

H.M. A.B.’s argument really leads to direct adminn by Govt. Dpt. on G.P.O.

model. Somethg. to be said for that on electricity and gas.

Or ???? Commn, B/Control, B/Inland Revenue. Then they are

Civil Servants.

P.M. Then daily adminn is subject to Parly. control. Need to avoid control

by P.Q.

A.B. Health Services will be so controlled.

Shall have to consider this further – it is dividing the Party.

G.T. Who decides developmt. issues as between. gas &amp; electricity?

H.G. I do, under M/F &amp; P. Act. And powers under these Acts to approve

developmt. plans.

A.B. Transfer of municipal undertakg. to Bd. = transfer to body with lesser

degree of accountability to public.

I argue that power of Bd. shd. derive from Minister.

H.M. And then Minister is accountable to Parlt. for daily adminn.

C.E. Case for variety.

Wd. have liked to see Electricity directly administered by a Govt. Dpt.

21

H.M. So wd. I. But too late now.

A.V.A. Don’t like these irresponsible Bds. Too like Corporate State.

We must watch this development.

H.M. Other diffy = rate of salary must be higher than in C. Service.

J. Avoid uniformity. Learn by experience.

A.W. Welcome this because more flexible.

A.B. Right of Bds. to promote legn. Surely wrong.

H.M. More convenient – private Bill – saves time.

When not so, Minister can with-hold his approval.

P.M. But private Bill legn was a ramp. And shd. be cut down.

A.B. And still are a ramp.

And why shd. these bodies have right of access to Parlt.

H.M. It wd. be a hybrid Bill even if Minister promoted it.

Power to oppose. Either they must have power to oppose, or Minister

must do it on their behalf. Latter not desirable.

P.M. May be a Bill promoted by a l.a. with M/H. approval.

H.M. Why shdn’t Bds. oppose those?

R.S.C. Can only be a Bill affectg. private property. Can’t affect any public

issue.

Appointment of Sc. Board.

H.G. Constitutional issue re “after consultation.”

H.M. Think joint appointmt is worse.

R.S.C. x/ Can’t you give assurance in Parlt. there will be consultn.

There isn’t joint responsibility here.

Agreed x/ Vote down the Sc. Members!

M/H. and B/T. will raise small points direct with M/F. &amp; P.
