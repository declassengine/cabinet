C.M. 70(48) 11th November 1948

1. Parliament. [Enter W.W.

H.M. Business for next week.

Steel Bill: Opposn. spokesmen. Presumably O.L. and A. Duncan (tho’ latter is not a member of Tory Party).

Guillotine may be requd. Opposn. will be sounded but can’t think they can agree to voluntary time table.

W.W. Agree – tho’ dislike guillotines.

H.M. W’out it, H/L. won’t get Bill in time to consider it.

P.M. We must be ready for it.

H.M. Wd. Cab. wish to approve it? We propose 30 mornings in Cttee. – some p.m.’s cd. be added : 4 days on Rpt. : 1 day for 3rd Rdg.

P.M. Must have steady attender teams.

A. Date of 3rd Rdg.?

H.M. Mar 13th fr. Cttee. shd. reach H/L. by mid May.

A. Believe they will ques. 2nd Rdg. and amend heavily in Cttee. Time needed for to ‘&amp; fro’ 2 Houses. Wd. have liked it by start of May.

Otherwise, can’t get 2nd Rdg. until after Whitsun.

H.M. Can’t improve on this time table.

W. Telegraphy Bill.

P.M. Went pretty well : but some concessions will have to be made before you are thro’.

H.M. Opposn. wd. wish to limit to navigational. But a) hard on listeners. b) Diff. to distinguish acc. to effect.

A.B. P’pone enforcemt. v. private citizens until adminve. field cleared eg. by seeing what equipmt. is available etc.

H.M. We will try to hold mtg. with Dpts. on this before Cttee. stage.

Debate on Address.

H.M. Final division. V. full attendance. Congrats. to Ch.Whip. Agreed.

287

[Exit W.W.

[Enter Henderson &amp; Brian Robertson.

2. Berlin Elections.

H. As in memo.

B.R. Little to add. W. Govrs. believe Berlin elections shd. be held. Br. haven’t bn. keen on elections in w. sectors alone because gives R. chance to repudiate magistrate. German dissent. Battle of Berlin is being fought by Germans – resistance will be weakened if we prevent elections.

Anyhow, U.S. wdn’t agree to p’ponement.

Memo approved. [Exit H. &amp; B.R.

[Enter Mayhew.

3. Cyrenaica.

P.M. Need this be taken at once?

C.J. Not terms of agreement. Only ques. of principle. Draft based on Tanganyika precedent in the main.

A.V.A. Defence clauses as agreed.

Agreed : H.D. to preside over ad hoc mtg. F.O. M/D., W.O., I.O.

C.R.O. and Fin. Secy. Ty.

[Exit Mayhew.

4. Economic Affairs.

P.M. Building. Man power rising : how does it accord with materials.

A.B. Housing is in balance. For some time workg. off backlog. Then had to increase starts, with no rise in price. Diff. but did it. S.E. situation also improving.

We have absorbed 3rd wage increase in greater efficiency, w’out increased price. All controls save steel and timber will be removed by end/Nov. because materials posn. has so much improved.

230.000 men on perm. house bldg. out of 1.300.000. Prices risen 13% since 1945 as cpd. 40% overall. Can’t hold it unless other forms of bldg. held under control. My contractors can leave for more prof. forms eg. factory bldg. Can H.Q. Bldg. Cttee consider means of holding prices outside house bldg?

Agreed.

R.S.C. Endorse that.

288

H.W. No control over factory bldg. by private enterprise. That is where danger lies.

A.W. Endorse what A.B. said : am concerned about it.

Alarmg. increase of t.b. in Scotland.

Am submittg. proposals to R.S.C.

Housg. costs are not falling as in England.

[Enter H.G., G.S.,

P.M. Man power on bldg. has risen above target.

R.S.C. We realised earlier we cdn’t draw labour off – and let up on our resns.

A.B. But resources went to industrl. bldg.

R.S.C. No : we supplied more timber for housing.

H.D. How many workers drawn off new constn. and housg. because increase bldg. limit to £1.000?

R.S.C. V. few.

A. Rural housing. Cd. it be given a lift? Re-conditioning cottages.

A.B. Man power, not materials, limit that.

A.V.A. Emphasis on repairs of farm bldgs.

A.W. Repairs require the v. types of labour requd. for finishing houses i.e. joiners and plasterers.

A.B. Going pretty well. Must concentrate first on new houses. Before reconstn. can begin.

A.W. Posn. of housing generally is not so satisfy. in Scotland. Embarrassed because A.B.’s public self congratulation.

[Enter Barnes.

A.B. Continuing drift to London.

A. Due to life with in-laws.

R.S.C. B/E. say 43% of bank advances are purchase of houses : about £100 m.

[J.S.

G.T. Advocate continuing control by labour ceilings. Materials control isn’t enough.

Development of M/E. p’mme has bn. determined by labour ceiling not by allocation of steel.

A.B. Executive act distributes labour force.

G.A.I. Not so simple now as G.T. thinks.

289

How can we enforce ceilings – in widespread labour supply adminn.

A.B. If Dpts. play the game, control can flow from planning of projects.

A.W. Contractors will use their labour on maintenance.

A.B. Raising private limit to £100 didn’t lose us labour or materials.

Don’t believe £1.000 for industrial will hurt us either.

R.S.C. Coal. Autumn drive has led to some improvement.

Still accumuln. of low quality coal. Special steps to shift it.

H.G. Discussed with N.C.B. Must push this into consumption here – unsuitable for export. Will run the stocks right down.

that is essential to m’tain exports. Power stations.

Dissatisfied with autumn drive. Am reportg. to Prodn. Cttee.

Also intend to spray ???? with fuel oil.

P.M. Man power falling?

H.G. They cd. absorb few thousand more – in right places and with hostels.

727.000 (via 724.000 now) wd. be ideal for this year.

736.000 by end/49.

Don’t raise target too high. Alibi for short fall on prodn. targets.

A. Absenteeism?

H.G. V. bad. Actual shifts worked to 1st Nov. is better than 1947.

Now not so high because Sat. workg. was then new and effective.

Joint Prodn. Cttee. trying on this too to push new scheme.

As conflict with Comms. develops, we must expect more problems. in coal fields. Scotland, S. Wales and Yorks. Must face losing some output.

A.B. Small Cttee of Ministers to watch this? Unofficial. We cd. smash trouble in S. Wales.

H.G. Accept that idea gladly. A.B., T.G., U.S/S. Scotland.

R.S.C. P.7. Table II. Worst feature = mining machinery.

H.G. P’mmes were cut. Targets here given were much exaggerated.

A.V.A. Tinplate?

G.S. Can’t keep workers. Dying industry. Margam will put thousands out.

Will be below target until Margam comes in.

R.S.C. B/Paymts. not bad. Losing gold and dollars because E.R.P. paymts. are lagging.

290

Because of complic. procedure and own failure in some respects, paymts. are delayed. Fear on 2nd appropn. Congress may reduce because total for 1st year not spent. Have asked Dpts. to accelerate work on claims.

Movemt. of Prices. Fall of 3 pts. – while exports rose by 7 points.

Considerable turn in terms/trade. Favourable. Don’t know how long it will last.

H.W. Oct. figures show daily rate same as record July figure.

App. address balance in Oct. lowest for nearly 2 yrs. £28.8 m.

H.M. Retail price. Cd. we urge retailers to keep them down – or consumers to hold off.

R.S.C. They have done well on whole.

A.W. Hoping to get shoes down. Competition doing more than any price controls.

A.B. Freight rates are falling.

R.S.C. Invisibles are moving in favourable dirn. No figures yet. Guesses.

Last quarter of ’48 may be running in credit overall, tho’ with big dollar deficit. But then U.S. may say we don’t need help.

A.B. Heavy expenditure on alloys. Developmt. of prodn. here. Shd. be encouraged.

A.W. Buyers’ market increasg. because w’drawal of U.S. buying. Eg. newsprint and timber. 170.000 standards of bldg. timber in new Yugoslav. agreemt. – will make a big diffce.

A.B. Plywood from Africa?

H.W. Have a mission out on that.

G.A.I. Para. 1. 30.000 increase in total w. popn.

46.000 “ “ civil employmt.

27.000 “ “ manufacturg. industries.

20.000 “ “ unemployed. Due to end/holiday.

Seasonal work.

Industr. dispute 1.800.000 days lost in 1st 10 months of 1948.

2.176.000 “ “ in 1947.

This was period when disputes after 1st World War at peak.

Publd. 16/11/48.

Expansion in developmt. areas – worthy of public mention. Includg. resilience of workers in gaining new skills.

291

H.W. White Paper just out.

H.W. All doing v. well except Merseyside. Now declared developmt. area.

Male unskilled labour. Wd. have bn. dockers years ago.

H.D. Put up new cotton mills.

H.W. Expanding Booth and B’head.

No recession in shipbuilding and repairs.

H.M. Curve of productivity flattening?

R.S.C. H. campaigns going strong.

Don’t really know accurately what posn. actually is. eg. Times articles.

H.D. Large passenger cars for export. V. satisfy. Looks as tho’ tax concessions did help.

G.T. Lpl. isn’t Lancs. Not 1% of pl. unemployed wd. be any good in cotton – anywhere in E. Lancs. Talking of Lpl. men.
