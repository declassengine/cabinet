C.M. 75(48) 22nd November 1948

1. Royal Visit to Australia : N. Zealand.

[Enter C.M. and J.Wh.

P.M. Read announcemt. to be published Tuesday a.m. here and in A. and N.Z.

Has come on suddenly – is quite serious.

Message of sympathy from Cabinet – agreed.

No disclosure before publn.

2. Commonwealth Relations : Eire.

P.M. a) Saw B. Brooke on Saty../Sunday at Chequers.

Full discussion : he raised no objn. said no other course was open to us. Told him we cd. say he had bn. assured tht. constitution of N. Ireland wd. be safeguarded. Points about local franchise and Imperial, as in my note. May be the ques. of Imp. Franchise will be raised here, by the Opposn.

b) Legal diffies. under m.f.u. Offls. of F.O. B/T. and H.O. to prepare. Agreed.

c) Consequentials eg. Irish lights, Tithe, St. Patrick, statute book generally.

N.B. to convene a working party to review these.

Draft statement read out.

A.B. Is the statement of A necessary?

P.M. She will say so. We can’t deny it. Necessary to say it – before it’s asked. General agreement.

R.S.C. Mention tht. we have consulted N. Ireland – Agreed.

A.W. Reverse order of 2 final paragraphs.

P.M. No.

A. a) Expand last para. on lines of summary.

P.M. Wait until we know what MacB says in Dail.

b) Maximise friendly statements by MacBride.

c) Salisbury : what wd. be posn. of loyalists living in Eire. That will be bull point for Opposn. We shd. give answer clearly in advance. Include in statement.

P.M. V. well : in last paragraph. But don’t interfere with “comparable” : for it gives us elbow room which we may need. May be acute (eg. on franchise) in N. Ireland. Position of loyalists will in any event be better than now.

310

P.M. I intend to see Opposn. leaders – on Tuesday pm. Will Ld. Chanc. and Home Secretary and N. Parker accompany me?

C.E. Posn. of loyalists isn’t clear now because loss of E. citizenship on acquiring another nationality. Does appln. under section 2 of B.N. Act have that consequence?

R.S.C. Amendmt. as at C. Approved.

A.B. Diffy. will be over N. Ireland.

J. This must all be provisional pro tem.

P.M. I will revise statement, when I know what MacB. is going to say. And bring final text to Cab. on Thursday.

H.M. Title of H. Commr.? Be ready with answer.

3. National Service Act.

[Enter 2½ [sic] Serv. Ministers &amp; W.W.

A.V.A. Nothing to add to memo.

H. R.N. need this less than any.

M.St. Necessary not for training, but for commitments.

A.H. On 1.1.49 237.000 in R.A.F. )

1.1.50 183.000 “ “ ) On N.S. at 12 months.

1.1.51 195.000 “ “ )

Increase to 18 months, and

1.1.50 213.000

1.1.51 212.000

This is only hope for us.

P.M. Real diffy is lack of skill, not nos.

A.H. Yes : and on 12 mos. service we cdn’t train skilled grades and get any productive service out of them.

R.S.C. This doesn’t commit us to any particular figure of expenditure.

Doesn’t mean tht. we are commd. to any particular total in nos.

A.V.A. Agree can’t be commd. But overseas commitments haven’t gone down as assumed. And run down increased by 141.000 as result of economies authd. in financial crisis of summer ’47.

We are now asked to strengthen Forces v. early risks.

311

If we can’t face expenditure, best method of cutting cloth may be to cut our commitments.

A.B. Can’t ride 2 horses in H/C.

Can’t put argument v. unbalance : they’ll say you cd. have known that before when you fixed it at 12 mos.

Decision to suspend releases – mistake to do it in Recess with few Ministers present. But, havg. done it and related it to internatl. situation, better surely to justify this on same ground. U.S. Forces at 2½ m. and service at 21 mos. Quote that.

P.M. But if sitn. improves steadily and overseas commitmts. decrease, posn. will alter again. Can’t sever the 2 points : they interact.

A.B. But internatl. situation is the reason why we haven’t bn. able to achieve balanced forces.

R.S.C. Don’t confuse total nos. and efficient nos. May be we shall call up fewer for longer. And Forces may be smaller tho’ more effective.

H.D. Genlly. in favour. But a) gloomy C.O.S. view of worth of Army even on 18 months. V. dangerous if this got out (p.12).

H.M. Why don’t C.O.S. accept 18 months with a good grace. Why doesn’t S/S. for War or M/Def. stop them putting this in writing.

A. Is p. 12 true?

R.S.C. Yes, by comparison with their demand for £800 m. and over.

H.D. Politically dangerous if there is a leak.

If we say 18 months, we must stick to it. No concession to Opposn.

b) Disturbed at rate of recruitment of Regulars. Just as important to bring that up. Can’t we hold on N.S. men if they weren’t browned off by idleness during N. Service.

P.M. Agree. Wood Rpt. V. bad re. home and not good re overseas. Shows failure – misused time. The new C.I.G.S. is going into this with gt. vigour.

H.D. c) Plan to raise age of call-up. All educationalists now support view tht. N.S. shd. come betwn. school and university. The univ. will be wrecked if the age goes up to 20.

G.A.I. They can opt now for earlier call up. That can be continued, w’out amendmt. of the Act.

H.M. On H.D.’s point (b), shall we have an answer in H/C?

P.M. Must be a frank confession tht. it was so –

312

H.D. Can we say anyone has bn. sacked?

R.S.C. Yes – C.I.G.S.!

H.M. Can’t we say what is being done to put it right?

M.St. Wood Rpt. recommns. are being put into effect. Constant pressure on unit commanders. These drives do produce results.

P.M. Believe some people ought to have bn. sacked. – eg. D/Training and several Generals. Will see S/S. on this.

G.T. Real argument to face is : time was wasted for 12 mos., now for 18 mos., unless you can show organn. has bn. remedied.

P.M. Or “is being”.

P.M. I will get to Def. Cttee. full report on what is being done.

H.M. Similar complaints about R.N. and R.A.F.

H. Recent independent enquiry has shown no such waste of man power.

N.B. Recruitg. to regulars – as good as at any time pre-war : v. remarkable in full emplt. A recruiting achievement.

A.V.A. Obvious points raised in discn. – most are under considn.

Cab. unfair to Services. All plans falsified on assumptns. eg. Greece and Trieste.

Inefficiency in training arrangemts. due largely to these changes of plan.

A.B. If finance is to be limited, you will have smaller no. of men bearing a heavier burden. Diff. politically. Bitter opposition must be expected.

W.W. There will be. Confine Bill to one or two points – reject any minor details.

H.M. We have agreed to that.

A.B. Doctors : A.V.A. was right last time – not relevant to this ques. Agreed earlier that for doctors age must be raised to 30 so as to prevent the student who continually fails to qualify up to age 30 shall escape Service.

G.A.I. Only other points for inclusion are minor : one advantageous to the man. (about reserve obligns. of men who take on for service after N.S.)

The other – affirmation resolution, wh. dropped out on consolidn. in error.

313

H.M. Party Mtg. Wednesday – will P.M. come?

P.M. Yes.

W.W. If Bill is to pass by Xmas, Bill must be presented on Wed. and publd.

before weekend for 2nd Rdg. Thursday.

H.M. Special mtg. of Legn. Cttee on Thursday – to pass the draft.

4. Service Pay.

A.V.A. Ty. wanted this mentioned.

Promised in July to consider hardship and pay.

Concluded no grds. for increasing pay of officers, but increased allowances are justifiable because c/living and accommodn. Adjustmts. also being made in allowances for other ranks.

Also adjustments to bring Services into line with outside emplt.

These are being made in such a way as to stimulate recruitment.

Fairly easy for R.N. and R.A.F. But much re-adjustment in Army – increased no. of st???? divisions.

Statement Wedy. – White Paper afterwds.

£12-12½ m. p.a. gross cost. Net. after taxation, £10½ - of which £8 m. goes to other ranks.
