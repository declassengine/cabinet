5. Economic Affairs.

R.S.C. Coal: deep-mined not satisf. – opencast too good.

H.G. Mustn’t be too pessimistic. Expected another lift in this period.

Don’t know reason. Increased absenteeism or failure to decrease = statistical cause.

157

G.A.I. Wastage increasing. But attitude to f. labour has improved: &amp; we cd. get more in if accommn cd. be provided.

H.M. Thought on absenteeism is necessary.

H.G. Agree. Tax concessions from 5/7 will help. It isn’t getting worse: merely tht. we haven’t had expected seasonal improvement.

R.S.C. Bldg. Good results in Mar/Apl. P’mme in E &amp;W now in balance

Scotland v. bad: 21/2 years to complete a house.

H.M. Cotton: over-time ballot failed?

R.S.C. Leave it to go fwd. on trade basis.

E.B. They can’t get on.

R.S.C. Disinclined to give political help with this.

E.B. Point is: we have differentiated v Spain re refusing to take non-essentials.

R.S.C. No: negotiators have instructions to treat Spain on same basis as others.

Clear it on O.N.C.

[Exit J.S.

158

6. Coal/Oil Conversion Programmes.

R.S.C. As in memo.

Case for making exception for railways.

H.G. Must take this line: &amp; be firm against compn claims.

R.S.C. M/Transport: we ordered the work &amp; shall pay for it.

Bound to be criticism. Avoid saying there will never be any oil.

E.B. Need you announce a clear-cut decision? Can’t you let it trail off – with rising cost of oil etc.

R.S.C. Must announce. They were promised the oil. Must now say they won’t get it.

Announcement approved.

[Exit G.S. &amp; B.

[Enter J.G., &amp; G.B.

7. Supplementary Pension Scheme for Miners.

H.G. Expounded problem; and put pros. and cons.

J.G. Put his view.

H.M. Favour 50/50 plan. So does A.B., who favours delaying it.

History. Miners case: their industry had bulk of injuries and via the ascertainment miners paid 55% or so of the cost. It was this wh. led us to decide to spread burden over industry as a whole. Now, miners argue tht. N.C.B. have bn. relieved of cost &amp; miners shd. get it back thro’ a supplementary scheme.

If this is not a 50/50 plan no incentive to miners to be modest in their demands. N.C.B.’s costs are high. And why shd. consumer carry an additional burden for this?

Also repercussions on other industries.

Act allowed suppl. schemes: but didn’t suggest cost be borne by industry.

N.C.B. will stand firm – if assured tht. No. 10 won’t give way on repns from miners.

P.M. Can’t you get this on basis of individual buying additional cover.

159

E.B. Yes you can do it that way. Or on J.G.’s basis: so much on the 1/= of wages. Worked in steel trade.

Always intended tht. these schemes shd. be contributory.

T.W. Can we take this in 2 stages:-

a) Do we preserve a contributory basis?

b) What are proper proportions?

R.S.C. Unless this is substantially contributory, can’t deny same benefits to war pensioners – at cost of £20m.

G.B. Doubt if you can hold it even if scheme is substantially contriby.

R.S.C. Thro’ price of coal, consumers will pay twice.

E.B. 2/3 m. in distribution enjoy posn tht., if full time employed, they can’t have salaries cut. Same with clerks. They enjoy full pay in sickness – employers drawg. the benefit to offset.

What answer on that can you give to miners &amp; others in industry?

Community shoulders 1/= p. ton., cost of w. compensn. Miners take 3/4d p. ton.

Support contributory principle. Approx. 50/50 in principle. But form &amp; method to be worked out.

H.G. No chance of N.U.M. accepting 50% contribn.

N.C.B. plan was v. limited. Even then contn was 101/2d a week. N.U.M. rejected as benefits v. poor for excessive contrn.

Diffy. is high cost of anything worth while in the mines.

N.C.B. attitude: think H.M. is mistaken. My imprn is that they won’t stand pat unless ordered by Govt.

Consumers: at present miners pay nothing; &amp; no ques of prices rising directly.

Delay: out of ques: diffies already because stalling. Assumed will come in 1/7.

R.S.C. Essential to m’tain full contrib. principle, even if we give a wage increase to cover it.

G.A.I. Dangers. High accident rate in rlways &amp; docks. They will come along for more.

Dangers of R.S.C.’s last suggn.

Let N.C.B. negotiate it. And Govt. stand out. Avoid having direct conflict between Govt. &amp; miners.

Miners shd. pay something: but N.C.B. shd. settle what amount.

T.W. This is a special case because high accident rate &amp; sentiment attaching to it.

Leave it to N.C.B. &amp; say in advance that No. 10 won’t receive appeal from N.U.M.

160

H.M. This scheme gives all round improvement in benefits.

Fear leaving it to N.C.B. They will give way. They have no sufficient care for consumer.

P.M. This is impossible ground on wh. to fight miners.

J.G. Don’t assert principle of 50:50. We can get near it in fact by my method. But on flat rate negotiation we shan’t get anywhere near 50/50.

E.B. Cdn’t they have their own Fund. Ton poundage to be contd by N.C.B. &amp; balance voluntarily by men. They are more careful in administering own fund than in claiming on someone else’s. And might help output.

More time to consider.

J.G. N.C.B. have to submit scheme to me. I offered assistance of my officials. This particular scheme was hatched by N.C.B. officials.

H.G. Attitude h’to has bn. tht. Govt. shd. not dictate lines of schemes. But I see no objn to makg. suggns.

Ministers shd. not become 3rd party.

J.G. If miners offered 1d in £7 a week on wages and N.C.B. xd p. ton on output &amp; came to me &amp; said this = product of that contribn; then I wd. wish my Dpt. to help in working out a scheme to spend it.

H.G. N.U.M. and N.C.B. are meeting on Friday.

Remember 1d in £1 on wages &amp; twice that by N.C.B. will give less benefit than rejected scheme.

R.S.C. I can agree tht. N.C.B. shd. offer X ton &amp; invite men to contribute what they can; &amp; that will be a fund on wh. a suppl. scheme can be based.

E.B. Say 4d a ton is N.C.B. maximum. Men can contribute what they like. 1d in £1 on wages wd. come near Bd’s benefit proposals.

H.G. Rather better.

E.B. But men must make substantial contribn.

Principle: must be contributory. Rest must be ideas not commitments.

A.V.A I don’t oppose justice to the miner. But you won’t resist pressure for more for war pensioners.

R.S.C. I wdn’t try to resist it, if soldiers paid same contribution.

161

[Exit H.G., G.B., J.G.

[Enter Listowel.

8. British Nationality Bill.

C.E. Objns to description “B. subject” – prs a few Fr. Canadians &amp; Dutch S. Africans. That wdn’t matter. But Indians &amp; Pakistan’s are unwilling, for good enough reasons, to be so described.

[Enter A.B.

Have had to face this diffy. already over Eire citizens.

“Comm. citizen” wd. be acceptable to the Indians etc.

Diffy = tht. Australia so refers to her citizens. This can be overcome. Matters v. little if Australian law &amp; practice continues use of “B. subject”.

Some people in U.K. will claim this is derogatory to U.K. and her posn in Commonwealth. But we must change our attitude if we are to keep people in Commonwealth.

Importance of getting this Bill this Session – so that U.K. preserves initiative.

P.M. a) This anticipates action re Commonwealth.

b) Phrase itself.

N.B. We have now reverted to “Comm citizen”. This meets (b).

J. Why not wait? Till we can know how it wd. be received.

A. Has bn. discussed. Believe Opposn will welcome this.

J. Will it annoy Australians?

C.E. No: just a bit awkward.
