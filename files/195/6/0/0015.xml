C.M. 16(48). 23rd February, 1948.

1. Palestine.

Bomb outrage. Why no immediate denial that B. were responsible?

E.B. No news yet from High Commr.

H.M. Shd. be a statement in H/C. to-day – repudiating this allegation.

2. Antarctic.

A.V.A. Nigeria will be in Falklands by 29/2.

Don’t damp down Australian offer. Say “not at present”.

3. Western Union: Organisation.

E.B. Don’t want to cut across E.R.P. machinery – or Europ. Cttees on coal

&amp; steel. Or duplicate Cttees &amp; staffs. in Ldn.

Diffy. is to guess how far a w. Union bloc can be created w’in that.

Many things affecting Ty. wh. don’t concern E.E.C. Most vital ques.

not provided for in machinery = our policy on financial ques.

Wrong tht. we shd. be losing gold to Belgium. Will need

separate considn – applicable only to w. group not to all 16.

Feeling our way.

Will keep Cab. informed as it develops.

P.M. Explain para. 12.

We have facts. What do you intend?

E.B. When our scheme comes in July: social services in U.K. will be much

higher than in Europe. Costs of production. Wd. help us if

others wd. come up to our standard. Also movement between

these countries will require reciprocal arrangements.

Interchange of labour is vital to future.

A.B. Necessary for fluidity of labour.

Ascertain how prodn costs shd. be weighted for this.

R.S.C. Will apply on development of Africa.

H.M. Worth examining. M/L. know most because I.L.O. experience.

They shd. be in Chair. I shd. like to be represented.

E.B. I.L.O. failed to make headway because tried to be universal.

A.B. Our Health Service will be available to aliens.

A.W. Cost 17/= p. head some years ago.

82

P.M. Begin with factual review of posn in w. Europ. countries. These

have Cttee to work on it.

R.S.C. Finance. Mtg. with Fr., Belg., Dutch &amp; Italy: seems whole economy

of Europe will brk. in weeks. Belg. is owed money by everyone

in Europe: owe to U.S. &amp; can’t pay. Looks as tho’ all imports

from B. will have to be stopped. Finance Ministers coming over

on Wed. Urgent need to consider means of stopping gold

paymts. w’in Europe.

E.B. Cd. be combined with purposes of Brussels mtg. on w. Union.

Wd. like that. M’while tempy. accommn with Finance

Minister (Belgium).

We can only escape from this intolerable position by getting on to a

broader base. Ramadin’s phrase “bye-passing the dollar.”

U.S. might even lend us the gold to start it – for Europe’s

disaster will be theirs too.

We can’t go on as we are.

R.S.C. Mentioned this because gives an opportunity. All these countries

are anxious to find a way out.

T.W. Is E.E.C. mtg?

E.B. No. Must decide to-day wtr. it shd. be convened.

Diff. to keep pace with U.S. attitude to ques. wtr. shd. be re-convened.

U.S. now suggesting it shd. Am asking what it’s to do.

G.A.I. Para. 2. Paris Cttee set up useful Cttee on labour ques.

E. Commn has apptd Cttee on man-power &amp; mtg. being called.

E.B. Consult me on this.

[Enter H.G., Key, Barnes, G.S., J.S.

4. Economic Survey.

R.S.C. Drafting points (e.g. by M/L.) will be considered.

Two ques. of substance a) coal prodn target

b) cotton labour target.

Coal Target.

H.G. Discussed with N.C.B. V. diff. to assess ‘48 output – variables like

manpower, o.m.s., strikes. V. likely extended hours will be

prolonged.

211 = substantial steepening of curve.

N.C.B. won’t go above 202 for deep-mined. I believe it poss. we will

get more e.g. 215 total. Don’t believe we’ll get 220.

Think 220 wd. be resented as unrealistic.

83

Ques. of effect of targets is uncertain. E.g. last week of 47 was worse.

Miners won’t like alteration now because improvement at end ’47.

Like rate-cutting.

Mght. encourage Horner to ask for more concessions.

Politically wiser to get target we can achieve.

U.S. No advantage. U.S. Amb. has said publicly 211 is stiff task.

Commd to giving Marshall countries high propn of excess over 211.

Can promise 18 m. (vice 15 m. for exports). Cd. reduce

consumptn by 1 m. and take 2 m. out of stocks. 14 m. stocks

are enough. If coal available for export from reduced

consumptn we shall be freer to use it for trade deals outside

Marshall countries.

Recommend therefore 211, as now (expect more).

Tell O.N.C. to raise export to 18 m.

Stop weekly limit on exports &amp; have N.C.B. to phase it.

Domestic relaxation – before end/winter – to carry fwd. deficiency

from one period to another. Wd. be welcome &amp; cost little.

Want authority to do it soon.

R.S.C. Will you insert 18 m. in para. 140.

H.G. Wd. like to – subject to N.C.B. views.

E.B. Why say it?

A.B. Need we lump in open-cast. Cd. we not set a target in deep-mined?

H.G. N.C.B. do it, in discn with miners.

A.B. Giving publicity – for psych. of miners.

H.G. Will consider.

H.M. P. Bd. &amp; E.D. Cttee favour 220.

Agree it’s diff. to decide.

But 46 &amp; 47 had special diffies – ’46 post war – ’47 weather.

Natural to expect much more in ’48.

Ques: realistic target (relatively easy to attain) or target to aim at.

220 wd. give an aim &amp; not be too unrealistic.

14m. tons isn’t too big an increase on 196 of 1947.

T.W. That means 14 m. increase as cpd. with 5 odd fr. 1946-47.

Repairs, rehabiln work must go on. Danger of neglecting it in favour

of output only.

A.B. Agree with H.G. on psychol. point.

What about target expd in rate of output at some point in year.

H.G. Welcome that.

84

H.W. Weekly target later in year wd. meet that.

P.M. Danger of “miners haven’t reached their target.”

G.T. Workers aren’t interested in annual figures. Cdn’t most of these

targets be put into weekly rate form – for publicity in factories

etc.

Agreed { 211 as minimum for Survey.

a) { state what this will mean in terms of weekly

{ rate in autumn.

b) { Don’t include the larger export figure in Survey.

E.B. Two years ahead there will be diffy. again. Is industry getting back to

quality?

H.G. N.C.B. are on to this.

N.A. Cdn’t more than 2 m. go from stock to export?

H.W. Wait for Coal Budget.

H.G. Coming v. soon.

Cotton Target.

R.S.C. Not realistic unless we are ready to take drastic measures at once

e.g. in stopping or cutting other indies. Para. 203.

G.A.I. Max. = 300.000 for cotton even taking those steps.

P.M. People cd. be got back to own mills when they won’t go to other

mills. Anything in that?

R.S.C. Not much now. For most mills have bn. re-opened.

True at outset of de-concentration.

G.T. Agreed. Success of concentn scheme = reason for our diffy. today.

Closing other indies needs careful considn. For Lancs. towns too much

dependent on cotton. Danger of creating developmt. areas.

G.A.I. Restrain growth, &amp; stop double-shifting – not close down.

H.M. Why wasn’t the drastic action taken? Why hasn’t it bn. taken yet?

Mtg. at No. 10.

Is management good enough? Shall we get enough out of them?

A.B. Why are we publishing all this stuff?

W. Paper on wages. Why publish this now, if we can’t debate until

Budget.

85

E.B. Female labour on Pools in Lpl. Courtaulds went where labour was.

Why shdn’t cotton move? Spread it out a bit more.

Repression of other indies will defeat own objects. Girls will move

out of Lancs.

H.W. Doing that. Have started in Cumberland. Lpl: trying to get

Littlewoods to start. But limited by factory bldg.

E.B. Can’t accept cutting down man-power target, when it means losing

exports etc. Wd. like to achieve it: but can’t do it by

compulsion.

H.W. B/T. want to keep this cotton target. Tho’ it does mean trying to

take cotton out of Lancs. &amp; restraining other industries in Lancs.

R.S.C. Prodn &amp; man-power targets must accord.

H.W. If you get 320.000 you won’t get all early &amp; will have to train them.

P.M. Put prodn in terms of weekly rate at end/period.

Agreed { R.S.C. to harmonise 2 figures w’out

{ reducing man-power target.

P.M. Para. 24. Confused argument. R.S.C. to reconsider.

Form.

P.M. V. long &amp; ill-written.

R.S.C. Pledged to produce annually. Shd. have bn. out by 1st Jan.

Promised for end/Feb. or early March.

A. a) Immense repetition.

b) Rest of sterling area expenditure (large contribn to our troubles)

not brought out.

A.B. Public assumes these are Govt. plans.

Out of date by time publd.

Not related to our other action. Will be invalidated by Budget.

Paras. of waffle eg. para. 250.

Exposes flank to hostile criticism.

Re-write (one man) = reduce by 50%.

P.M. So many false starts.

H.M. Hope R.S.C. will try to shorten this.

Publicity &amp; frankness in economic ques. has done more good than

anything. We have made the country economically conscious. T.U.C., e.g. statement cdn’t have bn. made years ago.

Time factor. Try to merge economic &amp; Budget debate. Will make

86

for improved Budget debate. But if M.P.’s are to make real

contribn, they will need some weeks to absorb this document.

H.W. Then it’s worth 3 or 4 days to get it in better shape.

Too long, too much economist jargon. Apart from that, not enough

light and shade. Too grim throughout. As a result, masks the

really grim factors.

Give credit for achievements: before saying how bad things

are because increasingly diff. problems.

Contd stress on shortages w’out distinguishing causes of

a) low output b) insufficient capacity.

R.S.C. Diffies = Cttee drafting.

J.S. Too late to improve it now.

Publish short version simultaneously. Use this as reference book.

J. Shorten and do it into English.

N.B. Full annual document necessary for Planning.

Public shd. learn Jargon ( ! ).

A bit too black. Comparison of terms of trade with ’38 shd. be

stressed.

Paras. 87-96 may have serious effect on India &amp; S. Africa.

Might stimulate drawings.

R.S.C. India safeguarded by agreement. With S. Afr. private agreement:

but trouble = flight from the pound.

We are seeking means of tackling that.

x M/Labour memo. is approved. x

Agreed { subject to revision by D. Jay.

{ Ministers to send in any comments.

H.M. R.S.C. to b’cast when this is published.

R.S.C. Not if it’s issued near time of Budget.

H.M. Need to handle Press. [Exit B., H.G., J.S.

5. Housing Programme.

R.S.C. As in memo.

P.M. 140.000 or 180.000?

A.B. Must be 180.000. Because finishing houses more rapidly than

expected.

P.M. Anticipating review which shd. have bn. held in July.

87

G.A.I. Support memo. Unbalancing labour: wd. help us to keep labour

in balance.

C.K. Welcome this. Brick industry in diffies.

Can addl. houses be put in areas where bldg. unemplt.

H.W. Reverses policy re Marshall (not running down stocks).

Right because of dislocation.

But bldg. other than housing shd. be brought into review.

Dollar-saving projects can’t go fwd. No start before late ’49.

Constructional steel = bottleneck. Early review.

M/W. to put proposals.

Some factories can be built in brick.

Cd. get more bldg. in old-fashioned design.

H.M. Balance betwn. housing &amp; industrial bldg.

Memo. approved. No announcement.

1. (contd.) Palestine.

P.M. Read latest informn.

V. weak statement by Pal. Govt. Suggests doubt.
