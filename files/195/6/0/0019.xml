C.M. 20(48). 8th March, 1948.

1. Siam.

E.B. Author of the coup has bn. P.M. ever since; &amp; has had vote of

confidence.

Recommend we shd. now recognise his Govt.

2. European Recovery Programme: Continuing Organisation.

E.B. Memo. by Ldn. Cttee approved by E.P.C.

Involves re-orientn of our economy – some loss of U.K.

independence over economic life. Need to inform Doms. of

this. Much too for C.O. to study.

R.S.C. Endorsed. Profound change in overseas econ. policy. Favour it as

only chance. But commits us to close assocn with W. Europe

&amp; to considering their interests as well as our own in econ.

matters. Must weave that into our relations with Doms. &amp; for

some (e.g. Canada) consequences may be awkward.

No real choice, but must have our eyes open to what we are doing.

P.M. Cd. remain separate in B. Comm. but wd. involve lower standard

of life.

Room for economy dependent neither on Soviet nor on U.S. – can

give high standard – but must be integrated with W. Europe,

and overseas dependencies of all. Means accepting planned

economy for Europe. Ques. for us: are we ready to say that our

planning shall now extend to Europe.

T.W. Diff. to oppose this. Drastic action needed to get viable.

But realise what it may mean. Para. 11. May not happen soon.

But may be argued we shd. grow more grain &amp; reduce our

imports &amp; leave Europe to send us more meat. Might

threaten our agric. expansion p’mme. Control allocation of

coarse grains might well tend in that direction. Wd limit

our freedom to buy.

H.W. May suffer in short run, in imports of food &amp; materials; but will

strengthen our posn in long term.

But no alternative, apart from F.O. angle.

P.M. Unemployment?

H.W. Diff. to say – depends on Marshall supplies.

H.M. Genl. agreement: for, if W. Europe goes economically, it will go

politically too &amp; situation will then be grave.

But must have eyes open to risks. Hope they may be mitigated.

102

Shd. make most careful plans &amp; have organn to make it success.

French, Italy are bad administrators – and Govt. bad too.

Much therefore will rest on our planning &amp; intelligence

organisation. We must get inside &amp; make the internatl show

work.

Suppose, even so, Fr. &amp; Italy collapse. May be vital that we shd. be

able to pull out. Keep that in mind.

Morals &amp; publicity leadership of Europe must be taken care of – on

lines of U.K. publicity. Encourage Fr. &amp; Italy to do it for

themselves: but U.K. Ministers cd. also appeal to foreign

publics in speeches.

N.B. Shall have trouble with B’brook Press. And need for active

consultn with Doms. before they see our view on this.

In fact, most of this will be of long-run benefit to Doms. as giving

them Europe as market for their expanded prodn.

My advisers want to avoid dramatic commn to Doms. Go slowly.

Don’t propose hasty Conference.

C.J. Endorse general principle. Col. developmt. depends on healthy

Europe. Fr. has exclusive economic attitude to her Colonies –

shall have to break that down. Respect for Col. Govts: avoid

impressn of exploitation.

P.M. New to me tht. there will be immediate hardships for U.K. as result

of this. Will it?

R.S.C. Our standard has bn. higher than Europe. And we’ve bought our

imports widely &amp; well. They may press now for a larger

share. Needn’t interfere much with us, esp. if the cake becomes

larger.

H.W. Coarse grains – we have pirated market. Allocn will prob. cause

quick drop, recovering later.

Timber – we have pirated. Shd. be little worse off.

A.B. Assume this doesn’t affect Ruhr steel?

E.B. No commitment.

A.B. Short-run worsening. From preventg. undue concentn of hardship in

any one country. We may have to agree to econ. assistance for

pol. reasons – e.g. for N. Italy.

Must be in short-term price for long-term benefits.

Doms. shd. be brought in at earliest stages – on planning &amp;

formulating policy.

Present this optimistically – not as forced on us by R. intransigence.

As Socialists we shd. have liked to do this years ago.

Emphasise positive aspects of W. Union, throughout.

A.W. No other way.

103

But mistake if accompanied by consumption cuts.

Will our standards of living or investment p’mmes have to be cut

in early consequence? If so, can cuts be made before this?

Future. How will the area pay for its imports? We managed to

pay pre-war. But Germany cdn’t. Will that diffy. arise

again? What consequences will it have for us?

R.S.C. This scheme won’t affect our standards soon. Those will turn on

Marshall Plan. Longer-term: if Doms. etc. increase their

prodn, hope for corr. increase of prodn in Europe: &amp; exchange

of goods w’in this enlarged sterling area. Take no more from

dollar area than they will buy from us.

A.V.A. Risk of undercutting B. sales because lower wage rates in Europe.

P.M. That is why E.B. has suggested equalisation of social services.

G.A.I. Does this mean we shd. slow down our importn of f. labour?

If unemploymt. may arise here.

A.B. How quickly can Doms. be associated with this?

G.T. Europ. recovery essential to ours. But keep Doms. in, &amp; bring them

along with us.

A. Not wholly convinced.

Need to intensify supply from Doms. &amp; Colonies – if Europe can’t be

viable at end/Marshall.

Some of the 16 are weak partners. Must see that our organn is

available, as H.M. suggests.

Support T.W.’s point. Livestock is our proper road of agric. expans.

Doms. Essential they shd. be brought in from beginning.

Need for great care in presentn.

N.B. Intentions. Telegram to go to-day to Dom. Govts.

E.B. to meet High Commrs. this week.

Send gloss on speech to be made by E.B. on 15/3.

E.B. Remember Doms. differ. Canada won’t join in this. They will follow

U.S. lead, in or out. I don’t want U.S. to play too big a part:

don’t therefore want to force U.S. on by urging Canada to

support this.

Australia &amp; N.Z. will support it. Cdn’t they second some good

economists to work with us in Ldn.

Dom. liaison is good on defence: But not good on pol. and

economic ques.

This = opportunity for getting Dom. liaison perfected, prs. on defence analogy.

Disturbed at talk of lowering standards. My object in this is to raise

them. The ⅔rds. calculn depends on vigour with wh. we push idea of

104

new sterling group in Europe.

Purpose of this memo. To commend a Continuing Organn.

Is it 4 years or perpetual? Argument for latter: otherwise can’t

play Europe &amp; it becomes mere charity.

French administration not so bad (?).

High Commrs. in Doms. Can it be overhauled? Too much reliance

in past on telegrams. Need for discussion. Liaison with Doms.

must be improved.

Sent Franks to U.S. But done nothing comparable in Canada.

S. Africa also needs review.

Liaison betwn. Doms &amp; Continuing Organn might be misunderstood

in Doms. And each Dom. country must be considered

separately on merits.

If U.S. Administrator apptd in Ldn., might get financial &amp; economic

experts posted to Dom. High Commrs. in Ldn.

Steel. Don’t know what will happen. My aim, however (in German

talks) is to review over-capitalisation of B., Belgian &amp; German

industry. Revive international cartel (!) “was done well pre-war.”

T.W. Para. 11 contemplates drastic changes.

Para. 9 of Annex.

Not my pessimism.

Hope these expressions of opinion will never be published.

Memo. approved.

3. Germany: Tripartite Discussions.

E.B. Circulated for informn.

P.M. Can discuss at another mtg.

4. Monopolistic Practices Bill.

Agreed: interested Ministers to meet (with R.S.C. or H.M.) &amp; Cab.

to discuss revised memo. on Thurs.

[Enter B., H.G., J.S., G.S., C.K.

5. Wages Policy.

H.W. Wdn’t want to bring to everyone’s notice for that wd. provoke

expns of view on wh. it applies to.

P.M. What of Bds.

H.M. Decided to do it.

C.K. “No need to charge maximum prices.” Cd. that be stressed?

105

R.S.C. Yes: when we have views of F.B.I.

Agreed.

[Exit above. Enter W.W.

6. Electoral Reform.

C.E. Feeling in Party that 80.000 electorates are too much for the

Member. Case for dividing these has bn. made out.

Satisfies all vocal boros. save Plymouth, who want us to take

a/c. of 1947 populn instead of 1946.

H.M. My only worry now is wtr. concessions go too far.

Bristol, Leeds, Leicester &amp; Nott. are addns, not restorations of

cuts proposed by Boundary Commn. Last column shows all

below 53.000 – low in relation to average.

C.E. Don’t regard this as connected with C/London or Univ. Franchise

ques. (H.M. had said Oppos wd. propose a compromise based

on relating the two.)

These proposals were framed on merits.

W.W. Diffies with Govt. supporters – met by C.E.’s scheme. Think we shd.

go ahead with this.

H.M. Opposn will also say Parties shdn’t tinker with this uni-laterally.

C.E. No authy in the text-books for Tory line tht. this shd. be done by

all-Party Conference.

P.M. Never has, save when coalition Govt. in office.

Agreed.

C.E. to ask Speaker to instruct Boundary Commn.

7. House of Lords Reform.

P.M. Lords generally inclined to accept our views on principles of

composition.

Then discussed Bill. They want 12 mos. from 3rd Rdg.

We offered 12 or 6 formula. They think this empty

concession.

Possible compromises. Real limit = 13 months, not 12.

We have considered 12 or 9 formula. effects on Coal,

electricity, Transport (14½), etc. Effect: prob. 1 addl month

as cpd, Bill as now. But incentive to obstruction in H/C.

That wd. mean guillotine: and wd. reach H/L. incomplete &amp;

exposed to criticism. And H/L. might decline to amend it.

May be said we have got away from obstructn, but not from

guillotine.

106

Effect of 12 &amp; 9 formula on Steel Bill. Cd. pass by 12.2.50.

Cd. get it in time. Risk, however, untidy because passed by

H/C. under guillotine.

Situation. Will Tories insist on 12 months from 3rd Rdg. or break?

Will Party acquiesce in 12 or 9 formula?

A. Tories forced by debates to press for 12 mos. from 3rd Rdg.

We cdn’t ask Party to accept that.

No practical diffy over 12 or 9 formula. Shd. be so drafted as to

exclude the extra month.

Believe Tories wd. accept that rather than break.

Recommend therefore offering 12 or 9. Go no further. And then it

must be an agreed Bill.

W.W. 12 or 9 &amp; agreed Bill is easier for us than having Parlt. Bill

rejected. Bill cdn’t then be enacted until Dec. 1949:

&amp; Steel Bill wdn’t go thro’ until Mar. 1950.

A.B. Not commd on composition.

My idea was tht. these talks shd. go on concurrently with Steel B.

P.M. Both composn &amp; powers are being discussed concurrently w’out

commitmt. Agreed already tht. Bill will pass or be rejected

this Sess.

A.B. But if you make H/L. a revising Chamber period of delay might

be less than 12 months.

P.M. Suppose controversial Bill takes v. long in H/C., 12 months is not

long. Exp. if Bills need much amendmt. in H/L.

A.B. The 2 yrs. is result of struggle between 2 Houses.

When Bill passed, period is what we think right. We have

admitted it.

P.M. No: 9 mos. may be necessary in extreme case. That is all we

admit by such legn.

All I want to-day is to know wtr. we can put fwd. 12 or 9 formula –

no final decision.

H.M. Can’t negotiate unless we know tht. Cabinet wd. contemplate 12 or 9.

The 12 is fixed in Party’s mind.

Not sure we shall exclude the 1 month.

May therefore mean extending delay up to 3 months.

But advantages a) shall have reduced 24 mos. to at least 15.

b) new composition of H/L. wd. be v. helpful.

c) on Parlt. Bill, we shall have agreed Bill

not likely to be reversed.

My view is therefore 12 or 9 is worth trying, in spite of diffies with

Party. But Cab. must be united behind this.

107

If not, better not try.

R.S.C. Whole point: effect on 4th Session. 5th Session is no use now.

Resume discussion, on memo. on Thursday.
