C.M. 55(48). 29th July, 1948.

1. Parliament.

H.M. Motion to-day of thanks to Campion. Hope Ministers will be there.

12.10. Friday. Royal Commn. Ministers shd. be present.

A.B. Talked with Victor ????? (?) Discussed U.S. housing: may be asked

to go to U.S. to talk of Br. pre-fabrication. Shall I go?

E.B. May I be consulted? Election year.

A.B. Will help with R.S.C.’s Council on industrial efficiency.

2. King’s Speeches.

H.M. Thanked J. for his help.

Prorogation. Can I settle with P.M. final terms – liberty to bring to

Cab. then if need be.

Some drafting amendmts. to be made.

R.S.C. Add reference to Eire Agreement, if it is signed. May be ready for

signature at end of week.

A.W. Has para. 28 bn. cleared?

H.M. Will be amended.

H.M. Opening Speech. Acceptable to the King.

A. de la Warr wants to know if we will accept Motions in short Session.

H.M. We want to adhere to plan tht. Parlt. Bill is sole business. Motions in

H/L. may provoke H/C. to wish to discuss other business.

Outside real emergencies, want H/L. to resist discn of other business.

A. We shall be waiting.

H.M. Even so, try to keep them silent. See how we go.

[Exit W.W.

[Enter G.S., P., A.H.

3. Civil Aviation.

P.M. We deferred final approval of long-term p’mme pending H.Wms report.

A. These machines already ordered. New procedure might apply to

modificns.

H.M. Pretty well committed to long-term p’mme by P.’s speech in H/L.

262

Was doubtful about sea-planes.

Right course wd. be to approve p’mme in principle w’out excldg.

possibility of argument by Corpns re modificns etc.

H.D. Agreed to Canadairs on understandg. that this wd. be sole deviation

from ‘Fly British’.

C.P. 191.

A. Welcome report in principle. Doubtful only about appln to

prototypes. Para. 39 onwards. Corpns cdn’t build up research

establmts etc. created by M/S. Beyond their financial powers.

This goes a long way. Further than I expected.

Paras. 28-30. Testing etc. wd. remain with M/S. Don’t see how

other development work cd. be done by Corpns.

Short of bringing Corpns into developmt. sphere I like this Rpt.

C.A. Cttee might prs. examine it in detail.

Need for early decision.

P. I like Rpt. Puzzled also by para. 39. But may be able to find a way

of drawing the line in the right place.

Under Act I am statutorily respons. for design, developmt. etc. of

civil aircraft. If grant made for that, it shd. be on my Vote.

Need to fix Ministerial responsibility.

R.S.C. Have h’to considered M/S. shd. keep it because link with military.

But Rpt. makes out good case for prodn orders.

On prototypes believe Rpt. is impracticable. Involves govt.

putting up unlimited money for Corpns to spend as they like.

What is wrong with more limited scheme put fwd. by Corpns?

Do they want more than this? Cd. they work more than this?

Esp. at moment of new departures like jets etc.

Prefer therefore to accept Rpt. on prodn orders: Corpn’s views on

prototypes.

G.S. Agree with R.S.C. Don’t believe Corpns cd. undertake responsibility

for developmt. work on civil aviation.

This is only new suggn in Rpt.

Ques. for decision is at what stage do Corpns put in prodn order?

P.M. Details need considn by officials.

Must pay attentn to advice from business men.

H.D. Wd be happier if I had more confidence in Corpns.

Power to order must not = power to violate Fly British.

R.S.C. No. This = power to order British.

A.H. Support M/S. Wd be retrograde to give this power to Corpns in relation

to prototypes. Can’t divorce prototypes from production types.

A.V.A. Support first 4 paras. of G.S. memo.

263

A.B. Can you have duplication of authy over prototypes? Fantastic.

H.M. Real diffy. is when does prototype end &amp; prodn work begin.

Can we agree in principle tht. Corpns be respons. for prodn types.

Allow officials to work that out.

Also allow them to work out how prototype responsibility

x/ cd., if desired, be given to Corpns.

A.W. £30 m. expense on r. &amp; d.

Ordering = foresight 10 years ahead. Want for that all the

scient. advice of Govt. Dpts. Corpns can’t reproduce that.

Trouble = goodwill needed betwn. Corpns &amp; M/Supply. That is

lacking.

Disposn of Corpns to buy U.S. aircraft off the shelf.

I cdn’t persuade Corpns to order Ambassadors. They now want

them, when they have flown.

P. B.O.A.C. are our creatures. Useless to blame them: if they are

at fault it is my responsibility.

E.B. Corruption: U.S. pressure to buy Constellations.

We must be clear what we are doing.

R.S.C. I couldn’t agree in any circs. to giving Corpns freedom to spend

money on prototypes. No need therefore to go into x/.

P. But see para. 47. This isn’t carte blanche for Corpns.

R.S.C. No veto power to Govt.

P. You cd. add that if desired.

P.M. Officials to review implications on basis of adopting this procedure. Then to C.A.C. Then to Cab.

R.S.C. Why go beyond Corpns own proposals?

P. V. well. Apply principle to prodn types

y/ Corpns proposals “ prototypes.

G.S. And consider where you draw the line.

Agreed { officials to do y/.

{ submit report to S.I.M. Cttee.

{ Then Cabinet consider.

A. Drew attn to 49.

Corruption: agreed no evce yet to warrant enquiry.

Care shd. be exercised.

49 shows it’s not only on side of Corpns.

264

[Exit G.S., P., A.H.

[Enter H.H.M., J.G.

4. War Pensions.

General discussion about Dutch auctions – pressure all round for

more money for all sorts of people.

H.M. Debate to-day. What is to be said?

H.H.M. Tory campaign. Centred on basic rate in order to distract attentn

fr. improvemts. made in special allowances.

M/N.I. comments. “inadequate.” I didn’t say so. Only in reln to

unemployable (para. 3). Don’t put the rest on grounds of need.

Don’t quarrel with (b).

Para. 7.(1). We shd. not admit this. I never will. We have never

related w. pensions to need. We advance it only on grd. tht.

more money is to be given to miners &amp; war is at least as

disagreeable as coal-mining. Equally, I don’t dispute 7(2).

I don’t want to overlook contrib. of miners’ scheme.

I wd. say this is the supplementary scheme for warriors – who

will otherwise have no supplem. scheme in the main.

Might help us to recruit for Forces.

Mine are modest proposals.

J.G. From outset w. pensioners have had advantages.

i) Disablement pension carries propn paymt. to wife &amp; children.

Even with suppl. scheme miners won’t do [as well] any better.

ii) In 100% case, full duplicn allowed for family allowances.

Larger the family the greater the disparity.

iii) Comparisons always made on basis of paymts. to privates.

All in industry are on basic rate.

Admit case of unemployable. Confine it, if anything done, to

that case.

All the rest must be discussed in detail. To avoid any more

disparities. Want a small Cttee for this.

R.S.C. The general 5/=.

Comparing diff. things. W. pensions never justified by c/living.

Other allowances have.

Only 43.000 w. pensioners are not getting wages. 94% are.

5/= won’t relieve this pressure for 90/= etc. Might even

increase it.

Any concession shd. be limited to unemployables (certainly) and

unemployed (perhaps).

H.M. Worried by claims &amp; counter claims. M/Govt. defective.

Not as good as l.a. co-ordination over allowances etc.

The argument of miners suppl. scheme must be rejected outright.

Not 1d of it comes out of public funds. We must be firm tht. it

doesn’t justify other classes making claims on public funds. We

265

must say it has no reliance.

May be a case for looking at particular grievances.

Make a stand against the rest.

A.B. Demagogy by Opposn. If one class is to get more, he shd. get it from

those who can best afford it. i.e. surtax-payers.

Admit their case &amp; say we will levy more surtax to pay it.

That will stop the Tories.

R.S.C. Impossible to allocate part of a particular tax to particular purposes.

A.B. You can do it notionally.

cf. Petrol tax for Road Fund.

Must find an argument for our supporters.

P.M. Mustn’t be rushed into a decision because Tories want a debate.

H.H.M. Why is there no supplementary scheme for w. pensioners?

P.M. Irrelevant.

At all times various indies have had suppl. schemes. Must State always

equal them?

E.B. Service-men can’t contribute – in short service. They are provided

for differently altogether.

Agreed: the argument based on miners supplementary

scheme must be rejected entirely.

E.B. Can’t he say tht. he is considering unemployable and unemployed.

Agreed: some concession to unemployable.

M/P. to consider case of “border-line limbless

men”: by way of allowing more earnings to

be disregarded.

R.S.C. If on merits there are some who aren’t reasonably off we shd. do

somethg. for them.

H.H.M. The 3 cases are equally deserving – para. 13. (2) (3) and (4).

R.S.C. I can agree to 13(2).

On 13(3) – form isn’t right. Shd. be for men with dependants who

have lost wages in order to go into hospital. Apply it to the

dependants.

H.H.M. I will consult Ty. on that.

R.S.C. Diffy. over 13(4) is that it is justified on c/living. Invites comparison

with industrial widow. They now get more. If you widen that

disparity you will invite claims for industrial widows.

Try to meet diffly the particular case of the 1914 widow whose

266

children are now adult.

Agreed: limit concessions to-day to 13(2) &amp; (3).

13(2) shd. not go above 30/=.

Main line in speech: defensive, critically refer to 1919 etc.

We have constantly watched this &amp; other ques. &amp; decided

(apart from pressure) these 2 things.

Agreed: L.P. Cttee to consider [Enter J.S.

repercussions generally. [Exit H.H.M. &amp;

J.G.

5. White Fish Industry.

H.M. Procdgs. of Cttee. Had to ask interested Ministers to w’draw.

Fisheries Ministers wd. have liked to go further – esp. to

appoint Fishery Prodn Bd. May be a stronger case for that later.

Pl. accept this &amp; don’t argue any more.

J.S. I accept.

T.W. Don’t think these recommns are worth putting in a Bill.

H.M. That is a new point. If you don’t want Bill, don’t have it.

A.W. I wd. rather have this than nothing.

R.S.C. Unworthy.

T.W. Grimsby near: middle fishers are losing money now. They won’t

build new trawlers, even with loans.

Age of fishing vessels. Shows we need a more vigorous plan.

N.B. These proposals wd. help surely. Otherwise they must go bust

altogether.

A.B. We have done a lot of work on this. The Bill wd. have considerable

merits. And wd. pave the way for further steps.

R.S.C. cf. cotton industry. Steps to encourage them to modernise.

T.W. I am against this Bill because think we shd. be ridiculed.

A.W. Diffce of opinion can’t be reconciled w’out practical test.

Let us make a start with this. And see practical result.

E.B. This ought to be under a single Dpt. Divided responsibility is

the trouble. I believe M/F. shd. take over whole thing.

Agreed. Proceed with Bill.

H.M. Proposal at foot of p. 4. M/Ag. is against White Fish Executive.

We can consider that.

Agreed. Look at Departmental responsibility.
