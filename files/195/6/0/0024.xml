C.M. 25(48). 25th March, 1948.

1. Communists in Government Service.

P.M. Line to be taken in debate.

What is posn of C.S. – non-political.

C.S. office at pleasure: can’t go to courts: no part. office or promce

liable posting at need of Service. And dismissible for

inefficiency.

Suitability for job – discretion etc., - apart fr. Comm. ques.

Not a general purge.

How to be administered – functions of M.I.5: they shd. not be asked to

take final responsibility.

Procedure. Before posting to secret branch, enquiry = Minister to

decide. If a man held to be unreliable, shd. be told so.

Advisory body: 3 retired Civil Servants. Man can appear. Not with

friend or repve of his Assocn. Can, however, offer witnesses of

character.

Final decn must be Minister. Indep. tribunal means either hiding

behind it or being pressed to disclose its views etc.

Latitude re early indiscretions.

Sounds of informn against a man can’t be disclosed.

Pensions. Can’t give man discharged on this a/c better posn than a man

discharged on other a/c. Few dismissals likely – mainly scientists

under F.S.S.U.

R.S.C. What informn will be given to man?

P.M. Enough to enable him to rebut.

J. Adv. body can call for other evidence – in his presence?

P.M. Yes: if it’s evce in his favour.

R.S.C. Shd. be given opportunity to resign vice dismissal.

P.M. Yes.

A.B. Publn of report of adv. body – must be resisted.

P.M. Agreed because Minister’s responsibility.

Why have we done this at all? Answer a) cowardly not to.

b) colleagues (scientific) have bn. unable to do their work.

G.S. a) Had intended: when a man was informed enquiries were on, we shd. suspend with pay for a month. Otherwise he cd. get a lot of

informn m’while.

E.E.B. Covered by circular.

135

G.S. b) Form of report. “Was a member of C.P. ’46 or earlier.” But

many were when R. an ally. Yet I propose tht. if a man has bn. member he shd. be screened.

P.M. Certainly.

G.S. Then shd. be understood there is no stigma attaching to enquiry alone.

H.M. Advisory body – shdn’t sound too formal. Avoid too much procedure.

“Body to investigate these cases &amp; advise Ministers.”

Don’t run M.I.5 down too much – bad for morale.

C.E. Report by Sp. Branch into pol. views of Met. Police. No truth in this.

H. Haldane empld, not by Admy., but by Med. Research Council.

R.S.C. Contracts etc., to Universities for research.

Care to see tht. Comm. are not doing the secret work there.

Risk tht. men you turn out will go there.

P.M. What of men in Forces?

A.V.A. Can be posted to other work.

You can say this is already looked after.

C.J. Corresp. action in Colonial Services?

P.M. Yes.

[Exit Serv. Ministers, G.S., W.W.

2. Wages Policy.

G.A.I. a) Cab. appd 8/3 lr. to Wages Councils. Sent copies to B.E.C. &amp;

T.U.C.

T.U.C. regarded it as directive. Saw P.M. Tuesday – with

R.S.C. &amp; H.M.

Propose substitute lr. as in draft.

Now merely a request tht. Wages Councils will bear in mind terms of

W. Paper. No diff. posn than ordinary wage negotiation.

Will ask T.U.C. if scope for any fresh misunderstanding.

Draft approved.

b) Meeting of T.U.C. yesterday.

News tht. lr. had bn. w’drawn was greeted with acclamation.

Thereafter all speeches were against. Mtg was alive with Comms.

But in end carried by 5½ m. to 2 m. Opposn = engineering,

N.U.D.O.R. and Civil Service clerks. Mikardo made the most

bitter speech of all.

Genl. Council have bn. bold – no support save from members of

Council.

136

c) C. Service Arbitration – on Typing Grades.

R.S.C. Granted increase but added – delay until out of present crisis.

V. awkward – pressure to say crisis is over, then all will bump up

together.

E.B. Consequence of Govt. “guidance.” Sympathise with them.

A.B. Not a bad formula.

E.B. Can’t complain.

b) Contd.

This calls for gt. care by Govt. Some wages are v. low at present

living costs. How can we ex-Union men defend £4-10-0 a week

of 48 hours. Esp. where we are employers we must go into these

rates &amp; see wtr. they can be justified.

A.B. Avoid allowing them to go to arbitration.

P.M. Allow cases of re-adjustment.

d) Liftmen’s Strike.

Genl. view – wage too low.

Ty. refusal to negotiate.

Below outside standards.

M/L. to report after Easter.
