C.M. 43(48). 25th June, 1948.

[Enter B., N. Ed., J.S., R. Makins &amp; T.L.R.

1. E.R.P. Bilateral Agreement.

R.S.C. Reported new formula on Art. II. Accepted.

Weakening on Japan. Won’t be part of Agreemt. At most a condn

of M.S. signing. And Douglas is authd to negotiate it here to

save time.

E.B. Commits us to a supplem. arrangemt. Trouble with Australia.

R.S.C. We haven’t agreed to that. And won’t.

Agreemt. can therefore be finalised.

Assets: U.S. have agreed we may say we have already complied.

H.M. Aim at presentn Tues. Party mtg. Wed. Debate followg. Mon/Tues.

R.S.C. See Lobby Tuesday with advance copies.

H.M. Can H/C. have Paper before statement? [Exit R.M. &amp; T.L.R.

R.S.C. No: can’t then evade ques. Will speak of general tenor of

Agreement, shan’t refer to particular Articles.

E.B. If other countries publish theirs in advance, how can we hold the

fort?

R.S.C. No: we have held it up. Norway, Holland &amp; Denmark must present

to their Parlts. at once.

We can say ‘await statement Tuesday’.

Will make statement Monday if Jap. point settled.

E.B. &amp; R.S.C. to settle between Mon. and Tuesday.

2. Dock Strike.

N.E. No change. Stats. at 10.30. No more going back.

C.E. Police confirm. Add 1.500 mtg. at Ldn. Docks &amp; 2 other smaller

ones. Strike Cttee split = majority will try to get other posts out

to-day = minority resigned on that a/c.

E.B. Deakin seen this a.m. Split. Trying to get mtg. Sunday.

Asked if Govt. will weaken? Told him we shouldn’t. He cd.

rely on our support.

Thought they wd. get some men out at other posts.

Smithfield prob. will come out. Don’t provoke that by puttg. men

in over week-end. Have organn ready to act Monday. Wants us

206

to defer large-scale opns by troops until Mon.

Long-term. Deakin suggests we shd. talk to T.U.C. re policy on

unoffl. strikes. View among men that helping Govt. in

unoff. strikes = black-legging. Statement by Labour Govt. on

ethics of striking etc., wd. do much good. Need for a lead to

rank &amp; file. Cd. Emergencies Cttee study this? Agreed.

P.M. Read draft answer to P. Notice Ques.

After discn: agreed say “nothing to add” to y’day’s statement.

Avoid attributing strike to Comm. “Unoffl. elements are always

exploited by Comms.” [Exit B., N. Ed., J.S.

3. Germany: Situation in Berlin.

E.B. Read text of statement to be made in H/C.

Mol.’s statement. My deductn: R. are afraid to venture too far.

They have played to East &amp; to Germans. To Eastern Slav States

they have talked of repns, Potsdam etc. To Germany, centralised

G., w’drawal of troops etc. It is propaganda statement.

R.S.C. Will put Fr. Communists in a real jam.

E.B. Don’t expect danger in Berlin. My feeling: Potsdam we undertook to feed Berlin. R. may do it when our stocks are out. But we

can go on feeding our troops &amp; keep them there. They daren’t use force v. us. We cd. supply our troops by air.

[Resumed after 30 minutes interval.]

[Enter Brownjohn, Strang

&amp; P. Dean.

Brownjohn. Situation serious.

Food stocks 27 days.

Electricity: only 50% can be supplied fr. western stations.

People are calm: &amp; will resist R. orders if we support them.

Robertson shd. make it clear to Sokolovski tht. he is to blame.

R. won’t yield: will go to any length, short of war, to get us out of

Berlin.

Can m’tain our own garrison by air. Might hamper it by balloon

barrage: but that wd. be act of war.

H.M. Cd. you force supplies thro’?

Br. No. Can’t shoot yr. way thro’ by train. Might by road: but

not practicable.

E.B. Cd. feed our troops: and have R. to feed civil populn.

R. cd. do that?

207

Br. Yes: if they wished. Doubtful if they would. Not imposs. only

10% of Sov. Zone.

J. Cd. we allow that popn to starve? Cd. we feed by air: cd. we

evacuate any by air?

Br. No impn on 2 m. by air evacuation. Cd. remove prominent G. who

have stood up to R.

A. Do we send any essential supplies to R. Zone?

Br. Not essential. Convenient. Now stopped. R. owes us v. large

no. wagons – 8/10,000.

J. U.S. attitude? Br. Clay has commd himself violently to remaining

in Berlin.

P.M. Any danger of clash between R. and U.S.

Br. We are always nervous of it.

N.B. Re-inforcing Berlin?

A.V.A. Wd add to feeding commitment and if we have to fight it won’t be

in Berlin.

H.M. Why don’t we close R. b’casting station in Berlin?

Br. If we did, they wd. cut our cable commn to Ldn.

E.B. &amp; A.V.A. to concert arrangements for expert

appreciation (with Fr. and U.S.): on military &amp; political

levels.
