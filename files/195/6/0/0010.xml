C.M. 10 (48) 3rd February, 1948

1. Parliament Bill: House of Lords Reform.

A. Y’day criticism centred on para. 1. as too limiting. No opportunity for ensuring adequate time for ventilation of differences.

Salisbury put this a.m. suggn at B. H.M. suggn at A. – I wd. prefer “considn” to “ventiln”.

J. Prefer alternative A.

H.M. Salisbury thinking of a Motion: better not to have that.

A. He won’t move it.

R.S.C. Don’t like impln tht. we admit their right to delay – if we now suggest this amendment.

Wd. prefer – “ensuring reasonable time for the due performance of their functions by the H/Lords.” Doesn’t concede that right.

P.M. They have the right now: legitimate for them to raise it.

J. A new formula like that wd. start the wrangle over again.

If you are going to have Confce, you mustn’t limit their talk.

Our formula nearly covers their point: why not go a bit further &amp; let them discuss whtr. in fixing the time there shd. be any opportunity to let public attitude become defined.

A.B. Then why not offer free discussion with nothing barred.

Objection to this = it raises v. issue of divided sovereignty which we want to end. Means H/L. is challenging, as well as revising, Chamber.

H.M. We aren’t considering what we shall agree to. Only an Agenda.

Advantage of condns is it excludes some discn. E.g. exclusion of main ques. of powers (a victory for us).

Case for H/Lds. (And we must be on reasonable ground).

a) Reasonable time to consider and revise. We must concede.

b) Reasonable time for discn betwn. 2 Houses.

c) Delay. Tories doctrine on this we must reject (power to force Election). But narrower point = on diffce betwn. 2 Houses on amendments, then shd. be time to enable public to appreciate issues and get their views known.

As issue for discussion, that last is a fair point.

C.E. This argument assumes H/L. discover defects in Bills which Tories in H/C. have missed. As a rule that isn’t how it happens.

Tories in H/C. take the points; and H/L. pursue same points.

We shan’t concede tht. Tories are judges of what public opinion is. But if we can’t get Conference w’out it, I wd. allow it to go

60

in, in least harmful form. For reform of H/L. in this Parlt. will be most acceptable reform to us we shall get.

T.W. Can’t expect Tories to concede their case before discns start. They have powers now: can’t expect them to accept words denying that in advance.

H/L. do take points often which Tories in H/C. have missed.

A.V.A. We have Party &amp; country behind us in policy of this Bill.

Why make any concessions now?

Put these words in: but you will instruct our repves not to yield on this point. Disingenuous.

P.M. Not at all. Not bound to give way.

R.S.C. But we have passed our Bill thro’ H/Commons.

If we wish to say they can raise points – we shd. let them amend the condns not suggest amending it ourselves.

If we amend it, we imply it’s at least worth discussing it.

A.B. This gives H/L. more power than they have ever had. Their status derives wholly from time. This calls in public as arbitrator between H/C. and H/L. Elevates revising Chamber into challenging Chamber.

H.M. It’s not a matter of H/L. judging public opinion. It’s forcing a period in wh. H/C. may judge it.

Practical ques. is merely shd. the one month be longer?

R.S.C. Say that: &amp; I will agree at once.

P.M. We have sent up Bills wh. weren’t adequately discussed in H/C.

R.S.C. We are trying to decide the issue not fix the Agenda.

After further discussions:-

General agreement with formula: “limited to ensuring

reasonable time for the due performance of their functions by the H/Lords.”

R.S.C. Let it be put fwd. from Cross-benches and accepted on behalf of Govt.

H.M. Let Govt. keep initiative.

Agreed: L.P.S. to put it forward.
