C.M. 39(48). 14th June, 1948.

1. Sudan.

E.B. No E. re-action. Contempt.

Will announce we mean to go on unilaterally. Promulgate next

week.

2. Germany.

E.B. French obstruction because their internal politics. Fr. Socialists

want another Conference with Russia. I won’t go again to

Moscow. Have exhausted that possibility. Only way of

dealing with R. now is to show determinn to go ahead.

Recalled development of policy over G. Attempts to secure

internatn of Ruhr – defeated by Fr. desire to dismember G.

Now the plan frustrated by Fr. desire for detailed technical

control over R. industies.

Fr. fears change. At first they wanted to appease Russia: then

guarantees from U.S.A.: then detailed control over Ruhr.

Satisfied tht. if Fr. won’t agree we &amp; U.S. must go on.

Fr. internal political intrigues – to unseat Bidault.

Hope we may get Benelux to go forward with us.

A.B. Present to France unwavering pol. front. Stiffen them fr. outside.

She can’t accept either isolation or dependence on Russia.

3. Burma.

E.B. V. serious developments. The P.M. is double-crossing us. Believe

B. is gone (Communist). We have commitments to supply

arms. I &amp; B. Cttee shd. meet to review posn. We may be

supplying arms to build up a Comm. State.

R.S.C. Send for Ambassador &amp; give him a straight talk.

P.M. P.M. was opposed to Comm. when here: seems to have gone over to

them.

R.S.C. There were 2 lots of Comms. They were trying to bring in White

Comms. Those talks broke down: but Govt. intended to try

again. Not sure tht. this isn’t the 2nd attempt.

A dangerous policy – may be only practicable one.

T. Nee wdn’t ‘double-cross’: but he’s not experienced politician.

N.B. This view confirmed by recent talk with Burma policeman.

H.D. Financial commitments also. We have some hold over them.

183

R.S.C. Get someone to talk to Tin Tut &amp; come home &amp; report. Agreed.

4. E.R.P.

E.B. Going better in W’ton.

R.S.C. But U.S. lust for informn may break O.E.C.C. completely.

H.W. U.S. techn. people (&amp; internatl Secret.) will now be associated with

Cttees.

R.S.C. Has made it worse so far.

E.B. Let me have facts &amp; I will take it up.

R.S.C. Ask Hall Patch.

5. Iron and Steel Bill. [Enter W.W., G.S., H.G., B.

H.M.

P.M. a) Scheme C. or D.

G.S. B. wd. split existing core of control under Fedn. C = Fedn unit.

R.S.C. Favour C. Shd. take unit large enough to give substantial control

in all main sections. Will make it easier to take Fedn in.

A. In App. p. 9. Firm 32 &amp; 45. Each employs large nos. G. Keen &amp;

Sankeys both employ more in ancillary than in steel.

80% of employees are doing something else. Why clutter

ourselves up with these activities? Will have to hive them off.

G.S. Much of this work has bn. found economically desirable.

We may find it so, too. In other cases we shall hive off.

G. Keen already hiving off their extraneous work.

Sankeys = borderline. But subsidiary of G. Keen &amp;

Lysaghts: so we shall buy them anyhow. And we can hive

them off later.

A. Politically v. awkward. Taking them over with intent to get rid of

them later. Diff. to answer.

R.S.C. This point arises on D. as well as C. cf. D. Long or English Steel,

R. Thomas – all have nos. employed outside.

No. of subsidiaries is not criterion of distinction betwn. C. &amp; D.

H.M. S.I.M. considered at length. Arguments balanced. But

a) greater the no. to be hived off, &amp; area of hiving off is

larger, you increase diffies. But C. or D., there will be a

184

problem over this.

b) large no. of firms to be handled – bds. of directors, to be

re-constituted etc. Fear adminve problem of straightening

out. C. involves 240 cos. (155 subsidies).

On other hand D. doesn’t cover all the steel element in the industry.

Ques: shd. there be competn betwn. socialised &amp; un-socialised?

(Scheme C. includes no. of small cos.) Two views: a) competn wd.

spoil monopoly. But b) competn wd. stimulate either one side or

other, as need arises.

P.M. Can’t you seek or provoke hiving off in advance?

G.S. Yes: when I can talk to Fedn, I shall say what hiving off can be

allowed &amp; what can’t. Sanction: retrospect. provns in Bill to

check hiving off which wd. sabotage our scheme.

J. Adminve diffies of C. are v. dangerous. Must we do this at one

stroke? Can’t we take powers but do a smaller scheme to

start with.

R.S.C. If you take Fedn unit (C.) your adminve diffies will be less than if you

take some diff. unit.

A.B. cf. para. 12 of S.P. 123, wh. shows C. is administratively easier.

And, politically, C. is far preferable.

J. That assumes co-opn of the industry: &amp; you won’t get that.

A.B. Anything less than C. wdn’t pass Parly. Party.

N.B. M/T. war-time experience suggests greater diffy over leaving out

than bringing in. Fedn unit is therefore the best.

H.W. J.’s suggn wd. perpetuate uncertainty: which wd. prevent expansion

of firms not taken over at outset.

H.M. Will M/S. be able to get hold of Steel House?

G.S. Hope, when battle is over, we may get the technical people.

You can’t take them over by statute.

H.D. They will have no alternative employment.

R.S.C. If you don’t leave out too many cos.

Agreed: Favour Scheme C.

The case for the Bill. (to be taken later)

185

b) No option to come in to nationalised industry.

H.M. Grounds shd. include obsolescence vice inefficiency.

A.V.A. Nos. employed? Union attitude?

G.S. Prs. 50.000. But Union will be content with Scheme C.

So my Parly. Secretary assures me.

P.M. There will be pressure from individual firms.

Proposal of M/S. approved.

c) Wide Powers for Corporation.

G.S. Propose Corpn &amp; natd cos. may do anything covered by Articles

of Assocn of all existing cos.

T.W. Includg. banking, farming etc. Invites opposition.

G.S. Alternative: activities already undertaken by cos. or more with

consent of Minister.

H.M. This = Parly. tactics. Alternative gives us enough.

Ques: wtr. we retreat to that, as a concession.

P.M. Criticism – other activities via Steel Corpn.

A.B. Ques. of Minister’s powers. Clear that Minister’s consent will be

required before Corpn goes into other business? If so, can

say they won’t be exercised when extraneous to steel.

P.M. Only practical point is how wide a flank you expose to criticism.

G.S. a) No hiving off, after 5 years, of important activities w’out

resoln of Parlt.

b) Industry makes &amp; will continue to make bye-products

e.g. moth balls &amp; tennis rackets.

Alternative (above) is enough. And Minister will control situation.

J. Flows from conceptn that State becomes single shareholder.

H.M. So long as Minister controls situation.

A.B. Must be public accountability thro’ the Minister.

H.G. No Parly diffy. in my Bills over powers – when you argue no wider

than cos. had.

G.S. But we had trouble over it in Transport Bill.

186

J. Believe Cl. 2 is unnecessary in either form.

Only power needed for Corpn is to hold shares.

If you want a new activity, promote another co. to do it.

Stick to conceptn of a holding company.

R.S.C. Agreed.

Agreed: M/Supply to consider &amp; report on this

new idea.

d) Parliamentary Timetable.

H.M. Space between various stages of Bill. Wanted by M/S. But

awkward Parliamentarily.

Wd prefer early publn c.f. at end of this Session.

P.M. Long before you can state your own case.

W.W. Cd have gap before Cttee: but not the later gaps.

P.M. H.M.’s plan wd. give all the chances to Opposn.

H.M. W. Paper and Lobby Confce.

A.B. No W. Paper – wd. put us on defensive.

My feeling in favour of early publn was to allay further

speculation about Govt.’s intentions.

R.S.C. Enough to publish during autumn short Session.

H.M. That wd. meet my view.

A. Must make our case soon: by W. Paper or by other means.

Must begin to build up our case. But don’t publish Bill

long in advance.

H.M. W. Paper or Party pamphlet. We must make the case.

P.M. Don’t usually have argumentative case put in W. Paper.

R.S.C. Nor is it wise to anticipate 2nd Rdg. speech.

E.B. Internationally – not too much delay. Publish &amp; push it thro’.

H.M. Remember there may be no chance of amendmt. in H/L.

Agreed: timing to be considered by M/Supply

H.M. and W.W. And report to P.M.?

187

e) The Case for the Bill.

H.M. This 2nd memo. goes some way to fill our gap &amp; meet my points.

Can’t rely too much on bad pre-war history of industry.

Cd S.I.M. go thro’ this &amp; look for addl points in favour &amp; bring up

a report.?

P.M. Incentives. How do you answer that?

G.S. Most of industry is run by salaried technicians etc.

Their incentive will be as before.

A.B. Propaganda (Govt. &amp; Party) to carry workers with us – to convince

them it’s not all the same as it was.

E.B. Doubt need for that. Trouble here is control by insurance cos. Fear of

workers in return of restrictionist practices when boom is over.

Thing to put over is our intention to ensure continuity of high

level of production. T.U.’s could carry this line well enough.

Managers aren’t influenced by profit motive. Don’t interfere

with salaries or perks.

Will there be opportunity for more personal management. Our

man responsible. Some natd bodies are more impersonal than

cos. were.

P.M. Who will directors be?

G.S. Eventually, working directors – such as we wd. wish to appoint.

E.B. I.C.I. system is good. Gives a personal touch.

S.I.M. Cttee to review case for the Bill.

f) Consultation with Industry.

G.S. Want to tell them &amp; invite their co-operation. Must give them

a chance.

Agreed.

g) Leakage of Information.

P.M. Observer must have someone in some office.

H.M. Started in Express on Saty. Believe it’s a politician – with a motive.

May prevent frank discussion in Cabinet.

A.B. Can’t understand this – Trefor Evans.

Cd. be guess work. Many Ministers have expd views.

188

Knew on Thurs. (&amp; told E.P.C.) that this was out: Massingham told

me.

A.V.A. C.A. doesn’t mention all these names. [Exit B., G.S., H.G.

6. Parliament Bill.

H.M. As in memo.

P.M. First course is clearly the better.

A. Can’t we get understanding with Oppn? Persuade them to reject

Bill at once.

H.M. Whips suggest consultn.
