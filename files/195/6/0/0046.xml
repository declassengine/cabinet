C.M. 50(48). 13th July, 1948.

1. Import Programme. [Enter J.S., G.S. and E.E.B.

R.S.C. Wheat 302 m. dollars.

Sugar 82. (20 to Col. &amp; 42 re-exports) for dollars).

Bacon 74. }

Cheese 15. } 126 from Canada.

Eggs 37. }

Cheese 10. (U.S. – bought).

Molasses 19. (Cuba)

Misc. foods 8. 547 m. for food.

Tobacco 63. Cut of 20 proposed.

R. Materials 629. .. .. 5% = 30.

Machinery 146.

Manuf. goods 56. 24 textiles for re-export..

Petroleum 251. (dollar content of own imports) 629 m.

The 126 fr. Canada is linked by them with wheat contract. At end/48

may negotiate 20 m. redn. But not prs. poss. to get 60 m.

Credit as well.

N.B. V. doubtful if we’d get both.

That leaves (food) only wheat sugar.

H.W. Tobacco. Cab. shd. understand effect. Shops out of Virginian &amp;

people won’t smoke Turkish. May get some people round to it.

But increased use of Balkan in blending = satisfy. can’t go much

further because diff. moisture content – cigs. go mouldy. Cd.

only do it by 3 m. dollars’ U.S. machinery &amp; addg. dollar

ingredients (molasses, cocoa, apple juice etc.).

Cut therefore means further cut in supplies. Cut now by 20% since

tax increase to ¾. 100% of 1940 consumption. No way of

rationing. Existg. queues etc., will therefore be magnified.

Unless manufrs. cd. be assured of replenished stocks by

Sep. ’49. And can’t give that assurance. They will cut

10-20% more in distribution. Political consequences. On top of

price increase.

Habits won’t change.

Stocks of Balkan tobacco = 40 m. lbs. 18 mos. consumption as

Balkan cigs. Cd. easily buy more – tho’ price is higher &amp;

might be diffy. over discriminn.

R.S.C. Wd. help qua W. Union.

Long-term problem. Only solution = increase Balkan propn. Must

face up manufrs. to this.

H.W. Subject to discriminn diffy. soln might be to sell Balkan cigs. much

cheaper.

240

R.S.C. Hoping situation wd. improve. Now clear it won’t. We must therefore

change over &amp; bring manufrs. along with us.

A. Believe we cd. get more from S. Rhodesia: in 2 years’ time.

You cd. relieve situation by that means w’in 2 yrs.

R.S.C. Want that relief for further easement on dollar tobacco.

H.W. Have done all poss. to increase Rhodesian prodn. Now w’in sight

of 15% of our total consumptn. Have discussed long-term

expansion over 4 years.

N.B. Limit to this expansion because S. Rhodesia must grow more food.

Otherwise another problem.

Bring in Balkan too.

Agreed: Tobacco cut by 20 m. dollars.

Raw Materials:

G.S. Doubtful if 1% more can be cut w’out effect on export etc.

Agreed: as proposed.

Machinery: Agreed: no cut to be made.

Manufactured Goods: Already fully screened. No gain from this.

H.W. Newsprint: Agree in principle. But want latitude because some

chance of increasg. home &amp; Scandin. Some prospect

of 5 p. newspaper before date mentioned in memo.

H.M. Hope we can keep open mind.

Also straw or grass. (Morning Post).

R.S.C. Needs caustic soda.

H.W. We are considering all substitutes.

Sugar. Agreed (y’day) that decision could be p’poned.

Wheat. Agreed – abolish rationing.

Take 100.000 off-take as a target.

(J.S. Can’t guarantee it.)

20% of farmers’ wheat. Genl. view that we

shdn’t get co-opn of farmers on that basis &amp;

cd. get away at O.E.E.C. with 80% collection.

R.S.C. Not my view. Believe we must do this.

A.V.A. How wd. the 20% be used? cf. Turton’s speech in H/C. on 12/7.

In relation to breeding.

T.W. Wheat feeds poultry, pigs or beef. That was why we promised in

Aug. – 2 pronged: to get larger wheat acreage and also

encourage breeding of livestock. Farmers responded both ways.

Wd be unwise to reverse policy at this stage.

241

P.M. Jan. decn to substitute coarse grains if need be was related to acute

shortage of wheat for human consumption. And there is none.

T.W. And decn of 22/6 was firm. And I informed F. Union.

A.W. Excess of potatoes this year will prob. decrease wheat consumptn.

J.S. Not below 100.000 t.

Explann to farmers. We cd. say we want more wheat in order to

de-ration bread. Shortage of dollars: same as shortage of wheat.

A. The full 20% won’t be retained. Many farmers won’t keep it because

haven’t stock. Yet these figures assume full 20%. This calculn

is fictitious.

P.M. x// Don’t w’draw pledge. Ask for max. delivery of wheat. Make coarse

grains available at lower price.

Agreed as at x/.

E.B. Concerned at 6 wk. stock.

J.S. Have enquired &amp; am alarmed. Suggested 9 wks. in C.P. 152.

Target of 10 wd. be v. dangerous.

On dock strike we were w’in 2 days of mills stopping.

R.S.C. Only in weeks immedly before harvest. Doesn’t apply throughout

the year.

A.V.A. Summer may be crucial moment. In 1939 millers, at Govt. request,

raised stocks by 1 m. tons.

R.S.C. If it’s strategic cover you want, you must pay gold.

But for current feeding aim at 10 wks.

E.B. Worst period of year: wd. last from end June to mid-August.

J.S. Can we aim at 9 wks. stock – only going above 10 wks. level if

we can get balance in non-dollar wheat.

H.W. i.e. authority to buy additional non-dollar wheat to bridge diffce

betwn. 10 &amp; 9 weeks. Come back to Cab. if he can’t get it.

E.B. Must be at liberty also to raise ques. on defence grounds of going

higher. Make it clear therefore to U.S. tht. 9 wks. =

minimum for civil purposes.

Agreed on this basis.

H.D. Does this mean avoiding loss of gold?

R.S.C. Gives up 70 m. saving. Shall know in September.

242

E.B. Care in announcing de-rationing of bread – change in method of

control. May I be consulted over this?

M/F. to submit draft to F.O. &amp; Ty.

R.S.C. No announcemt. of other decisions – until p’mme submd to

Washington.

Non-Dollar Programme. Agreed.

Agreed: Report in C.P. 178 can go to O.E.E.C. as modified.

2. Sudan.

E.B. High prices, esp. for cotton. 4½ m. being distd in profits this year.

Grave danger of inflation. May arise in other B. territories.

Want consumer goods to mop it up. – B’ham beads etc.!

Needn’t interfere with essential exports.

R.S.C. All African dependencies affected – genl. ques. We sought to get them

to hold back a propn of the higher prices in Equalisation Fund.

Being done in Colonies. Why can’t it be done in Sudan?

C.J. All the same, incentive goods are short. Sewing machines, bikes etc.

H.W. Little we can do on essentials. Will try to get together some junk. –

if Sudan will lift import restns.

J.S. Import restns in Tanganyika also.

Agreed: meeting while Howe is here. (C.O. F.O. B/T. Ty)
