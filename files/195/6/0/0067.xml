C.M. 82(48) 22nd December 1948

1. Indonesia.

[Enter G. Walker, Freeman &amp; Stevens.

E.B. Recited history from 1945 onwards.

Recently have left it to Cttee of good offices apptd. by Security Council.

Dutch For. Secy. told me he was going out to make final effort.

I warned him that if Police action were authorised serious trouble wd. arise.

Also met Bijl in Holland. V. frank talk. My line was – effort to settle.

Told a week ago negotns. had almost broken down – on incorpn. of Rep. Army into Federal Army, passing in interim period under D. High Commr.

Republicans wanted retain it as private Army. Dutch cdn’t agree.

We made repns. at the Hague and here. But what Dutch were claiming was what you did over India. Urged therefore Dutch claim on this was not unreasonable : and messages sent to Austr. and India.

First re-actions not unfavourable. Art.a(?) not unreasonable. But I was then asked by Dutch to get it put in regular form. Wasn’t aware there was a time limit : and my repns. were too late. Dutch announcemt. of Police action was made.

Told Dutch they double crossed me.

U.S. have taken it to Sec. Council, with Austr. Support. Calling for a cease fire. But no firing : bloodless seizure of capital.

Denning and Cadogan instructed to support cease fire resoln.

Ques of sanctions may be raised. Told Denning to stall on that, for I fear it wd. be empty threat.

Embargo has bn. continued throughout. Let up for a while during truce for clothes and lorry spares. Told my people to tighten up adminn.

P.M. Asiatic Doms. much concerned.

They told us Pol. action was intended. We denied it, on assurances of Dutch.

They deny any intention of emigri Govt. being set up in India.

Regard it on basis of treatment of Asiatics by Colonial powers.

They and Ceylon propose to give no port or airport facilities to Dutch.

Menon’s message fr. Nehru : hope we won’t stay neutral on U.S. resoln. even tho’ French and Benelux don’t support it.

E.B. Don’t yet know what resolution is.

P.M. Always has bn. a Dutch party wh. favoured strong hand methods.

Disturbed by report that Dutch are now united in support of it.

R.S.C. Communists have taken the other line.

H.M. Are there Comm. influences with Republicans?

356

E.B. I doubt it.

P.M. Stupidity of Dutch.

Can’t prejudice attitude on resolutions we haven’t seen.

E.B. Hope a vote may be deferred until tomorrow.

Agreed : we can’t support action of Dutch.

E.B. Troubled by risk of reaction in Australia.

H.D. Chifley has demanded cease fire, return of Dutch to previous lines, and early elections. 21st December.

R.S.C. We can’t refrain from supporting resolution moved by U.S. and Australia.

G.W. S. Africa won’t react quickly and may be reluctant to support Dutch.

India will make trouble over mil. and economic aid to Dutch in the West – as helping them indirectly in the east. This point shd. be answered – eg. arms embargo etc.

E.B. Dutch are resolved to go thro’ with this.

R.S.C. U.S. might face w’drawing M. Aid from Dutch.

E.B. They threatened it before. Will they do more than threaten?

A.B. Good thing if w’drawal of M. Aid were used for this purpose.

R.S.C. Don’t want U.S. to control Col. territies. of all European powers.

2. Germany : Reparations and Humphrey Committee.

E.B. Take note of background memo C.P.(48)306.

C.P.(48)303.

Much trouble over repns. Many of important plants are in Bizone.

Pressure from I.A.R.A. powers.

Long time to get live/industry fixed. Good level eventually agreed : wd. give Germany a standard comparable to our own. Must however be careful about war potential.

Congress carried Cl.115(f), however, wh. compelled Adminn. to review repns. p’mme to see how it might be amended to assist Europ. recovery. E.C.A. appointed.

Humphrey Cttee. proposals. Our modified proposals.

Thought U.S. were intending to propose expansion of G. steel capacity.

French cut up rough. U.S. saw red light.

Recommend action as in para. 2.

357

R.S.C. Fundamental ques. Cardinal point = our attitude on G.’s place in W. Union. If we count on her as ally, max. industrial strength.

But if we think it more important to keep industry to lowest point consistent with viability, we must take a diff. line.

I wd. like first to have views of C.C.O.S. Must know first which leg we are to stand on.

Eg. our proposals involve removg. all boiler making plants in Br. Zone.

This is one of main bases of industrial strength.

Which of the alternatives do we as a country think we ought to adopt – the Fr. or U.S. views. Where do we stand?

25% of all that is removed goes to Russia. We shan’t get much of this.

A.V.A. No view from C.C.O.S.

Our C.O.S. think a) danger of these plants being overrun by Russia. That is greatest menace because we can’t stop R. advance.

b) Importance of rebuilding W. Germany.

c) Danger in course of b), of allowing aggressive G. to emerge.

Inconsistency of U.S. policies under s.115 and 117.

R.S.C. How far do you want to use these plants to produce defence equipmt. for other W. Eur. countries? U.S. have overlooked this.

A.B. I have bn. consistently opposed to dismantling. Have always thought it enough to control, by inspection, finishing ends of the trade. That wd. not interfere with basic industries.

Stress on risk of falling into Comm. R. hands. The risk is just as great in France – probably greater.

Fantastic to dismantle G. plants on that a/c. while we pump finished munitions into France.

Importance of building G. economy to a point at wh. Comm. penetration can be resisted. Hence leave as much plant there as possible : send none to R : and ensure proper inspectns. in order to allay French anxieties.

E.B. Agreement on level/industry : can’t go back on that.

This proposal is an improvemt. on that fr. German point of view.

Boiler capacity : we shall have quite a few : Hitler got the capacity up to much too high a level.

Principle tht. we shd. not build up G. faster than the countries they overran.

P.M. Pari passu with Europ. recovery. Fr. and Benelux must be strengthened.

But G. must come down to be in scale, fr. high Hitler levels.

A.B. You cd. take part of current deliveries.

358

E.B. I believe in control at finishing end. But Fr. believe opposite. Have bn. forced to stop discussing principles and handle it plant by plant.

H.D. Can’t do better than this.

Fundamental need is to keep G. weak.

Strong G. is worst neighbour in Europe.

Gtest. risk is strong G. uniting with R.

Plants in G. more dangerous than in Fr. because they are further east.

The threat is not Comm. infiltration : it is R. military advance.

G. is still the greatest menace. Old G. “arrogance, insolence and self regard”.

T.W. Disagree in toto.

To keep G. weak may be good business militarily but not economically. Makes them readier victims of R.

Potential power of France to resist aggression – nonsense. Remember Chamberlain. And they let us down in 1940. And are much weaker today morally, let alone physically.

Leave G. with enough economic strength to assure reasonable standard of life and remain free.

P.M. Balanced judgement. Weak and depressed G. might offer herself to Sov. Russia. To get her into W. Europe economy she must have some strengths. But if she gets over-fat, she will kick.

E.B. 12 m. forced labour taken to build these plants while Europe lay prostrate. Far beyond anything needed for normal economy.

cf. R.S.C.’s line on Bizone p’mme for E.R.P. Was this consistent?

R.S.C. Dilemma is too logical. No man cd. answer it.

My policy has bn. to bring G. into W. Europe, and to give them economy wh. wd. enable them to co-operate there. But I can’t guarantee that they will behave in western fashion. Nor can you.

Signs already of nationalist revival.

Fr. analysis – Poucet? – people at Bonn will be assassinated.

On the facts : at 10.7 m. tons of steel, plants left for fabrication will give her better standards of living than ours.

J. Support E.B.

Any policy involves risks. Which we take? At present, greatest risk is from Russia. Want G. strong, economically and happy. But E.B. can’t pursue a policy in disregard of Fr. and Benelux anxieties. That wd. put strong card in hands of Comm. or de Gaulle in France.

H.M. On the memo. E.B. shd. be supported.

We shall, however, have to face long-term policy re. Germany.

What do we want? G. more likely to be driven into R. arms if weak.

Desirable thing = strong, democratic Germ. actg. fully with W. Europe.

How can we ensure that? Wants working out.

Doesn’t accord quite with H.D.’s view.

359

A.V.A. Support H.D.

In negotn. deal with this ques. Humphrey Cttee. line = so much war potential must be left that a little more won’t hurt. But it is the marginal capacity that makes all the difference ques. security.

Hope therefore E.B. will get down to 117.

A.B. Para. 2(ii) “if this becomes necessary to secure agreement”. This, surely, is wrong emphasis. I want E.B. to leave as much as he can.

P.M. Humphrey Cttee have disregarded security altogether.

A.B. Maximum economic strengths, consistent with views of Fr. and Benelux.

H.D. No.

P.M. Consistent with safety.

E.B. Also B/T. interests involved on some items. Things we cdn’t do during war – can’t leave G. in possn. of those things.

We have paid 4.000 m. dollars to feed G. since the war.

A. Can’t be sure of lasting principles.

First, F.O. done well to push Fr. as far as they have.

Second, these plants represent capacity far beyond normal econ. needs.

While we do our utmost to draw G. west, history compels not to forget character of the German. What confidence can we have in a strong Germany? Can’t rely on them.

U.S./France poles????: this plan is a fair middle course.

G.T. Don’t forget treatment of Weimar Republic – we had to give to Hitler later much tht. we denied to them. Might have bn. better if concessions made earlier.

Inspn. at finishing end was always intended by A.P.W. Cttee.

Policy must go this far, to level economic strengths. The discn. we have bn. having really concerns the longer-term policy.

H.W. We have agreed to this memo.

B. industry less keen on getting repns. plant. Their anxiety is not to leave too much in Germany – esp. engineering industry.

But cdn’t oppose U.S. on that ground.

Memo. approved.

[Exit Freeman :

[Enter Att.Genl.

3. Germany : International Authority for Ruhr.

E.B. Discussions procdg. Want authority mainly for communiqué.

360

French outburst was premature – hadn’t appreciated military safeguards.

Art. 18(a)(ii) – drafting change.

Art. 19. Re-draft of 11(b) on p.17.

A. Para. 17 of memo. Final sentence. Why isn’t it practicable?

E.B. G. in isolation – can’t single them out for internatl. ownership.

Wd. create awkward situation.

Also, who wd. own it? U.N.?

Sooner or later, functional developmt. in coal, steel etc. thro’ W. Europe.

Detailed executive control by French. No output.

I therefore favoured control by inspectn.

G. Will recover her dignity : then there will be trouble.

A.B. Suggd. moratorium for 5 years : to get G. Govt. confirmed by 2nd election before it concedes this vast economic asset. Art.18(ii) won’t protect us. These men were evil because they had power.

E.B. U.S. wd. have liked it. But G. social democrats were bitterly opposed to it. Assumed we shd. undermine their positions.

Had hoped for Fr. support on socialisation. But they don’t. They have shares(!).

R.S.C. Method of operating G. Vote. What happens if it can’t be settled?

E.B. Won’t hold up whole agreemt.

H.D. Art. 12. We are in controlling posn. on voting. V. important.

Att.Gen. Art. 24. default provns. Whole ques of enforcemt (sanctions) is really left in the air. Suppose that is inevitable?

E.B. Yes : will turn on appln. of principles of Byrnes’ Treaty, as stated in communiqué.

[Exit Stevens and Att.Genl.

[Enter Key and Marquand

4. Census of Distribution.

H.W. If not held in 1950, action cdn’t follow in next Parlt.

Political diffies., however – as in memo.

P’ponement for one year wdn’t solve these because shops wd. have had prelim. notice before election.

Form is now so simple tht. it can’t cause any trouble to small shops.

Strong Party and T.U.C. pressure for a policy on distribution. Can’t have one until we know the facts.

361

H.D. Don’t accept that view.

A. Not keen on this plan. Don’t need the facts before framing a policy

Plan = unpopular census : then after 2 yrs. a R. Commn. : then a policy. Not much popular appeal in that plan.

R.S.C. This is 2 yrs. late.

A. Put thro’ Bill which requires this census to be taken.

That was based on unanimous report of Cttee apptd. by Caretaker Govt.

We are concerned now only on time.

Labour Party have had no policy because facts aren’t known. Hampered by lack of such facts. For planning they are essential.

Other countries have this sort of informn. esp. U.S. – and we are at a disadvantage.

Unless we repeal Act and say we will never do it.

A.V.A. You do need knowledge of facts w’in Party before policy is framed.

There is scope for economy, no doubt. But knowledge of Co-opve. and chain store figures satisfies me tht. there is no panacea here to produce miracles.

First thing to do is to get the facts. And under compulsory powers.

H.M. If H.D. can frame a clear, attractive policy – I wd. prefer to avoid forms in 1950.

E.B. Form is easier than Football Pools.

A.B. Not inconsistent with Party Cttee. Doubt if that Cttee. will produce general policy.

Election will be fought on 4 year Plan. We shall have to say tht. if you will the end you must will the means. If we believe in Planning we must have the instruments for planning.

We have an easy answer to objns. by shopkeepers.

We shall have to say why we p’poned. What reason cd. we give for 2nd p’ponement? That we fear Wormersley?

H.D. The small shopkeeper is part of floating vote : don’t want to alienate him in marginal constituencies.

Agree we must have census. But we don’t lose by holding it in ’51.

R.S.C. Worst of both worlds. They will have preliminary warning in 1950.

And will be said we p’poned because of election.

G.AI. Do this now.

Political blunder to wobble over this.

What is man power in distribn.? I must know more about it.

Wages Bds. must know whom they are covering.

P.M. Electoral Diffy. a) This form might be confused with p’mme.

362

b) P’mme wd. be criticised as anticipatg. facts.

H.D. No general proposals affect. retail trade as a whole.

P.M. Cd. we p’pone for a few weeks, and study the forms.

Agreed : P’pone discussion.

H.D. R.S.C. and H.W. to discuss together.

5. Housing : Tied Cottages.

A.B. Cttee. of Party appointed to meet farmers’ Unions repves. On tied cottages.

I am asked to defend decision. V. diff. posn. for me.

I want to invite their views on re-conditioning tied cottages.

Mtg. is fixed on 3/1/49.

H.M. Cab. have taken a decision on this.

Is that to turn on how Unions take it?

Agree we shd. let them know : but not invite pressure from them.
