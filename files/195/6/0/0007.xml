C.M. 7 (48) 26th January, 1948

1. Iraq.

E.B. Iraq. P.M. has gone back. Shd. be all right. If not, stand on old Treaty.

False or exaggerated, report by Reuters was partly to blame.

R.S.C. Will addn of Dom. members to Bd. of Reuters help.

2. Potato Supplies.

J.S. Shall be open to criticism if we have an acreage target wh. won’t give enough at average yield.

Consumer wd. be ready to pay 1/9th of penny more &amp; be reasonably assured of unrestricted consumption.

True – consumption will fall if other foods become less scarce. But any surplus cd. be fed to animals.

P.M. Gardens &amp; allotments. Free seed?

T.W. ½ m tons in ’43. But ’47 only 350.000 t. Discussed in Nov. means of increasing cultivation: &amp; l.a.’s etc. urged in Dec. to get ahead. Propaganda in hand. Free seed might be eaten vice planted. Expect another 80.000 t. fr. that source.

P.M. More drastic action.

T.W. Conferences being held all over the country.

P.M. Many places where potatoes can be planted.

E.B. I saw many in I.o.W.

T.W. Must get volunteers to work allotments &amp; l.a.’s to make them available.

R.S.C. Tradn of allowing farm hands to plant some rows along the edge of a field. Cd. we not revive &amp; extend that?

P.M. £1 a ton in terms of free seed might produce better results.

T.W. 1.423m = minimum acreage. We shall get that. Must now get best yield from it.

J.S. At 7lbs. yield, deficit = 360.000 t.

E.B. Why on earth can’t you get that amount grown by vol. effort.

Private gardens cd. do that on their heads.

R.S.C. Easy to run a Press stunt on this.

42

T.W. Doing much on these lines already.

E.B. Sick of these unending arguments between M/F and M/Ag.

All this over ½ m tons of potatoes.

G.A.I. L.a.’s being told to close down on road work to get men on land. Cdn’t they consider employing them on growing potatoes on waste land in possn of l.a.’s.

E.B. 250.000 new houses with gardens.

Agreed { no increase in price.

{ vigorous campaign to promote all possible growing

{ of “supplementary” potatoes on allotments,

{ waste land etc. L.P. to concert this campaign.

[Exit J.S.

[Enter G.S.

3. Export Targets &amp; Textiles.

R.S.C. Summarised memo.

Primary need = step up prodn. But Lancs. is difficult.

We shd. give a warning re coupons.

H.W. Mtg. to-morrow.

Appointg. our man to represent both me &amp; M/L in Lancs.

E.B. No one will vote for extra hours in Lancs. Must get a factory to do it.

G.A.I. Have done that.

G.T. This industry hasn’t bn. brought into consultn yet – as we did with N.U.M. Know Unions are difficult. Have consulted only 2 Unions &amp; then only on Evershed Rpt. We haven’t put the facts to the people in the districts.

R.S.C. I went round = met all Unions = also 1.000 repve mtg. = with &amp; w’out employers.

Nacsmith on Planning Bd.

G.T. But not more recently on new situation.

Need for publicity campaign, to bring it home to textile workers how much we rely on them in this crisis.

H.W. Don’t dissent. Will consult G.T. &amp; get his advice.

C.J. Will Cttee cover wool?

R.S.C. Yes, concentrating first on cotton.

43

Memo. approved.

[Exit G.S.

[Enter H. Patch.

4. Devaluation of French Franc.

R.S.C. Read draft statement, to be made in H/C.

E.B. Concurred.

A. How will you control?

R.S.C. Block all Fr. (private) sterling in U.K.

Fr. may by in sterling goods &amp; sell in dollars – landing us with francs for our dollar exports. For franc unofficial may go to 400 or so per dollar.

Belgium may follow suit = so may Holland.

Then we may have to devalue sterling – v. serious.

A major upheaval. This involves a risk of it.

A. Can you limit Fr. purchase?

R.S.C. Yes = depends on capacity of Fr. Govt. to control own nationals. Fear it may shake out the Govt.

Then anything may happen. Schumann &amp; Meyer carried this thro’ Fr. Cabinet v. their Socialist colleagues.

Their real aim = get back 2 billion dollars held by Fr. nationals in Ldn., Berne &amp; N. York.

U.S. attitude. Friendly Ty., but apprehensive State Dpt.

Support our view, but reluctant to force it on French.

I.M.F. original intenn was to issue a much more critical statement. Strikes at basis of Fund.

Finishes Bretton Woods &amp; with it currency basis for world trade.

Fr. Govt. think it best gamble they can take.

Contest underlying it = conflict betwn. free &amp; controlled economy, on wh. Fr. Cab. divided.

Belgian attitude is inscrutable – as usual on financial affairs.

Believe they may intend to do the same. They don’t think this will affect them.

[Exit Hall Patch.

5. M: Churchill’s “Second World War”.

P.M. Recalled earlier decision.

Genl. principle re military secrets.

No objn to inclusion of 8 W.P. papers.

44

Payment to Exchequer. No case for that.

R.S.C. Agreed.
