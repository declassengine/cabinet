C.M. 66(48) 25th October 1948

1. Headquarters of U.N. Organisations : Location

R.S.C. … Strong line in favour of Europe. Failg. that p’pone.

H.M. Was originally inclined to view tht. all agencies shd. be together, with common secretariat. Hasn’t worked out that way.

Think F.A.O. shd. be in Europe. If so, where? Attracted to Italy – need to lift Italy up : large agric. interest : politically advantageous.

Shdn’t be dismissed.

C.M. F.O. view : substance – reason for U.S. co-opn. : agree with M/F.

P’pone merely to get good U.S. offer on accommn.

Don’t think F.A.O. in W’ton wd. mean I.T.O. has to be in U.S.

U.S. have now accepted idea of distributg. these agencies.

Agree there are arguments each way : but on balance favour p’ponemt.

If Europe : Copenhagen via Rome because internatl. organns. have not done well – bad Ital. staffs and subordinate to It. interests.

P.M. Agree with R.S.C. – both financially and also because of apparent subordinn. to U.S. – both arguments v. concentn. in U.S.

These strongly to keep some agencies in Europe.

H.D. Support Europe. But lean twds. Rome. Italy is U.S. pet : more likely to get U.S. assent.

A.B. Deplore tht. none are in Ldn. Failed on W.H.O. because cdn’t provide accommn.

Argument settles on Copenhagen. Rome is spiv’s city, under Vatican influence. And double rejn. makes it too internatl. – pressure groups.

Favour Copenhagen.

A.V.A. Not Rome until at least Colonies etc. settled.

N.B. Rome is least desirable. Old agric. organn. did not good in Rome Internatl. organn. doesn’t buck up a country – merely gives more knowledge of defects.

Don’t want dollars to dictate long-term policy.

Two U.N. Hqurs. now – N. York and Geneva. Advantages of concentn. adminve. costs etc., so obvious tht. various agencies have moved to Geneva (eg. transport. W.H.O.)

Can’t get F. and Ag. to work unless head people meet often. If separate, req. office in other.

Favour one or other of U.N. Hqurs. Prefer N. York. Don’t think pressure group argumt. amounts to much. eg. Jews over Palestine : have achieved nothg.

P.M. Dissent from that.

268

A. Long-range interest must be to bring substantl. propn. to Europe.

Criticism tht. we are subject to U.S. dominn.

This applies particularly to I.T.O.

C.J. Endorse view of P.M. and R.S.C.

Better not Rome. Prejudice v. Italians in all African territies.

G.A.I. Support R.S.C.

J. Copenhagen.

P.M. Europe as v. U.S.A.

Copenhagen/Rome : arguments evenly balanced.

Thus, try for p’ponement.

Support Europe.

On Europ. site; argument for siting in more settled countries. But don’t come down flat for any one Europ. capital. If Italy, prefer Milan.

2. Steel Bill.

H.M. Present Wedy. : publish Friday.

Presn. excluded steel from debate on Address. Precedents for this. May be challenged. Opporty. for debate on Bill itself.

A. Won’t prevent discn. in H/Lords. Noted.

3. Private Members’ Time.

H.M. Contemplatg. 7 days for 2nd Rdgs. and 3 for Rpt. and Third Rdgs. if needed. They may ask for 10 days anyhow and use balance for Motions.

P.M. Give them 10 days. 7 days for 2nd Rdgs. and use other 3 for further Bills if no Rpt.

H.M. Looks silly. Offer 7 for 2nd Rdgs. and further 3 if requd. for completion.

A.B. Then you can’t block after Cttee stage.

R.S.C. Must block at earlier stages.

4. Compensation for Ministers Killed or Injured on Duty.

R.S.C. Anomalous posn. War-time practice (introduced in specially hazardous times) contd. in one or two cases. But i) applies only to flying ii) private insurance cos.

269

Ques: as in memo. No gt. principle involved. Somethg. to be said for insurg. Minister as any other servant of Crown.

Not much in favour of extendg. Injury Warrant to Ministers just for this single risk.

Wd. prefer tht. Govt. shd. carry own risks or go on using outside co. If second method, no publicity needed. If first or Injury Warrant method, legn. will be needed.

P.M. What of M.P.’s – servg. State and earng. salary and exposed to same risk.

Any payment ever made?

R.S.C. Bribuer.

P.M. Why treat air accidents specially?

R.S.C. Because it’s being done.

P.M. Bring it to an end : special war risk was special reason for doing this exceptional thing.

H.W. M/F. scheme gives 2 yrs’ salary for £1 premium.

Why not let Ty. take that over and make it automatic.

R.S.C. Scheme limited to Ministers wd. be expensive.

H.D. Political idiocy to legislate on this.

P.M. Our salaries are subject to being cut off by events quite other than accidents.

A.W. Why not a comprehensive scheme for M.P.’s – all accidents and all Members – and let Ministers be included.

R.S.C. Not Ty. scheme.

A.B. No : let Ty. find out what a private co. wd. do. L. Govt. Bill empowered l.a.’s to do this, for members and officials.

G.T. Revert to pre-war practice. Risk of falling out of office is much greater than falling out of an aeroplane.

Minister who flies can take out insurance if he wishes.

A.V.A. You pay the expenses of a travelling Minister. Surely insurance is a part of the expense.

H.M. Then you must do the same for M.P.’s members of Estimates Cttee.

They are sent on behalf of Parlt.

J. Don’t do anything overt at present time.

270

R.S.C. Do we stop existg. practice? Shd. stop it or regularise it.

Agreed : discontinue existing practice.

[Exit J.

5. Cost of Information Services.

R.S.C. Gettg. up to figures which are open to criticism.

Shdn’t go beyond this. Any extension (eg. in foreign services) shd. be at expense of cutting others. We are at the ceiling.

H.D. We are thro’ the roof. This expendre. isn’t defensible.

N.B. Cttee of 3 Junior Ministers to plan a 3 yr. p’mme. We shall consider economies.

R.S.C. Fin. Secy. to sit in with this.

N.B. Agreed.

C.M. E.B. distinguishes betwn. home and overseas. It is home wh. is open to attack.

Have considered economics : found none possible. E.B. thinks indeed there are gaps to be filled. Eg. Col. b’casting and C.R.O. point. Cold war : also Britain in unique posn. to reply (U.S. aren’t in moral posn to do so). We are in an unprecedented posn. not excessive, related to defence expendre.

H.M. Home Services. Cttee is at work. Endorse this action. Staffs tend to grow. Enquiry will help Ministers.

Overseas : don’t challenge genl. case. But is there genl. supervision. Eg. Paris Embassy : What have we got out of it. Can given exp. be ended to make room for new. B. Council : what is it doing. Home Ministers havg. agreed to enquiry, why shd. overseas be left out. C.R.O. and C.O. content. Shdn’t enquiry go on to overseas.

P.M. Consider later on what form of enquiry needed on overseas.

Junior Ministers’ Cttees to suggest form.
