C.M. 78(48) 6th December 1948

1. Foreign Affairs Debate. [Enter J.S. and W.W.

P.M. a) Spokesman for this week’s debate.

1½ days : only 2 spokesmen therefore – to have room for back benchers.

E.B. will open.

H.D. May I make 15 min. speech – to reply to attacks by W.S.C. on my work in Paris. Wish to reply to suggn. that I favour only Socialist basis for W. Union.

E.B. I was going to reply to W.S.C.’s attack on selection of H.D. to do this job.

H.D. This kind of attack spoils our posn. in Paris.

Eg. on Inverchapil and Bridges (in Continental Daily Mail) and Wade.

A.B. Think H.D. shd. speak : but on position basis, not on the defensive.

Don’t let him excuse himself.

P.M. Let H.D. intervene in the debate on Friday. Shortly.

E.B. This will accord with W.S.C.’s intentions – he is to open on Friday.

On reply to debate M/State mayn’t be able to return from Paris.

Wd. prefer him to speak if he is available.

H.M. Or P.M. shd. reply.

P.M. Steam will be out of it after W.S.C. and H.D. have spoken.

An under Secy. wd. do – 3.30 on a Friday.

Agreed : M/State or Mayhew to reply to debate.

b) Scope of debate.

H.M. Can it be limited to Europe?

E.B. Must mention China.

A.B. Will E.B. say anything wh. wd. preclude future friendly relations with a Comm. Govt. in China?

E.B. No : mayn’t be a Slav type of Commn. Won’t burn my boats.

2. Western Union.

E.B. Resolutely opposed to talking shop for politicians.

328

But US/Fr. conspiracy to drive U.K. into Eur. economy. Not willing to accept that. Wider Comm. concern. Must therefore swing in the related overseas countries. This is unpopular. Must, however, face unpopularity over this. It’s Paris, not France, which presses for this.

Consultns. Cttee said Cttee of Enquiry shd. examine all these ideas and report.

Was a preparatory enquiry.

When Rpt. comes up we shall have to consider.

a) do we adopt a plan.

b) do we consult wider group of Powers includg. Italy?

Scandinavia.

I suppose b). Can’t hurry over this. Wd. involve frictions.

Want therefore to stress prelimy. nature of current discns. in Paris.

Mustn’t be rushed.

Same applies to econ. field. Fr. are trying to stampede us. And they will have Tory support here.

Must stand firm and build solidly.

Assembly notion – when wd. Germans be fitted in? Cdn’t get them in because no Govt. or Parlt. etc. But must get them in for sake of Europ. solidity.

Paris attitude is 1918 chauvinism.

Must challenge Tory Party to say where they stand on this.

H.D. Discns. in Paris. V. friendly.

Started in plenary – Br. and Fr. plans expounded.

Then Sub Cttee apptd. to go into all plans in detail.

Reynaud said purpose of Sub Cttee. was to marry the 2 plans. I denied that. Cdn’t say we accepted their plan in principle.

Popular assembly idea appeals to Oppositions. Reynaud and W.S.C. favour it.

Must stick to our line. May get Dutch support. But Dutch delegn. weak. And Belgians are only officials.

Shd. soon get a report examining proposals : submittg. decisions to Consultve. Cttee. Avoid disclosure of disagreemt. in the report.

R.S.C. French are escapist over this. To avoid facing realities.

3. Palestine.

E.B. We &amp; U.S. thght solution poss. on Bernadotte basis.

Marshall, after consultg. his Govt. said he wd. make statement.

We thought we shd. take ques. quick in U.N. – to stop fighting etc.

But alleged tht. U.S. told Arabs they cd. do better later. And Arabs voted for delay.

Men in Negeb v. Egypt. Army.

U.S. men ???? on Marshall’s proposals. Said no frontiers : only conciliation machinery.

329

A year before, in N. York, we urged U.S. to establ. machinery to get J. and A. together. That was outvoted. Now U.S. are back on it. M’while we burned our boats with Arabs.

We then drafted new resolution.

But Arabs won’t acknowledge Partn. They joined therefore with Slav and S. Am. groups and defeated it.

Back now on conciliation machinery.

Bad for economy of Pal.

Offer now being made on behalf of Arab Legion.

Gt. problem = Haifa. Settlement there wd. enable oil to be resumed. Emasculated resoln. will come up this week in U.N. If no ⅔rd majority for it, prev. resoln. of Security Council will stand – with Bunch as Mediator.

H.M. Suggd. U.K. shd. have some contact on ground with Israeli. Govt.

E.B. Consults in Haifa and Jerusalem.

R.S.C. They can’t communicate with Tel-a-Viv. That’s the trouble.

H.M. Cd. we not arrange some de facto link? Recognise we can’t recognise the Govt. de jure yet. It wd. help if this cd. be announced by Thursday. Admn. to U.N.?

E.B. Am much against the latter. Not yet a State, no truce.

A.B. So am I. V. awkward vis-à-vis Ceylon.

R.S.C. V. awkward for practical purposes not to have anyone with whom to make contracts. Eg. we are having to pay twice for timber for citrus packing. Also sterling and guns.

E.B. Can’t go on much longer helping Arabs who can’t help themselves or take advice fr. those who know better.

R.S.C. Trouble in Egypt?

E.B. Anti-Farouk.

Bombs thrown at Nahas’ house – thought to be provoked by Farouk. Wafd. is now hitting back.

Relieved we aren’t in Cairo now.

4. National Service Bill.

A.V.A. A.E. moving new Clause to put 18½ ceiling on call up.

This wd. defeat our object. Must resist it.

330

If A.E. pressed this to a Division and any of our people supported him we shd. be in a jam.

R.S.C. This wd. increase the charge : in so far as it involved calling them up sooner than they wd. otherwise be. Out of order?

A.B. Doubt it : for Bill doesn’t require Govt. to pay Service men.

P.M. Wd. this be attractive to our people?

A.V.A. Some indicns. it might be.

P.M. He is prob. only forcing a decln. tht. there will be ample warning to enable people to make their plans – esp. students and apprentices.

G.A.I. We shall be able to give proper notice if we know early enough what size of Forces is to be. We can’t keep changing the notice once given.

Can guarantee 3 months’ clear notice and possibly more.

H.M. Wise to give all assurances we can.

H.D. Cd. we also say that administratively it can be arranged that Univ. student can put his Service in between school and University?

G.A.I. Yes.

5. Board of Trade Enquiry. [P.M. (promted by H.M.) asked that this shd. not be recorded.]

P.M. Stanley may mention Ministers’ names.

Shd. action be taken by Ministers

Don’t want a procession. Nor a doubt.

J. Dilemma. a) If they give evidence, headlines and false imprisonment. E.g. S-G. and Hall. Mixes them up with dirty case.

b) If they don’t, will be said they don’t answer the charged.

I advised Att. Genl. to say, at end, names mentioned : all ready to come if you wish : but you may think it unnecessary. Chairman might then say nothg. wh. calls for denial by them, : unnecessary to trouble them.

R.S.C. Agree. Essential tht. Chairman shd. say it.

Agreed.

6. Licensing Bill.

C.E. Stated existing law.

Embassy has become bottle party. Circ’s remain a club.

331

Most bottle parties under D.R. under wh. Police have discretionary powers.

73 shut and no successful appeal made.

Provisions of Bill.

Enquiry since earlier Cab. No problem outside centre of London.

Hampered by Press statement – Fri. evening. And articles in Ev. Standard. implying tht. I was going to make concessions.

I now have support of Temperance movemt. on T.C.P. part of Bill. I shd. lose tht if I made concessions on night clubs.

Any club can now apply for extensions. Closing of bottle parties wd. prs. lead to increase in such applns. fr. restaurants and clubs. Embassy might now want to change back to being a club.

Suggest we shd. at this stage stand on Bill as drafted.

J. On earlier occasion I explnd. request tht. we had gone into this and

a) Think Police shd. have complete powers of control.

b) But unreasonable facilities for the young to dance.

c) Travel Assocn. Want to encourage tourists. Don’t want to give impression tht. London is dead.

But discussed Friday. Shocked by leakage. Made it the more difficult to go back on the Bill.

H.O. official put up plan : instead of “special occasion” you cd. have a provn. in areas designated by H.O. Police shd. be empowered to grant extensions much more regularly. That scheme I agreed to because wdn’t involve w’drawing anything from Bill : wd. be added to Bill.

Now Bill published, that is best way out. That is propn. to wh. I agreed. Hope C.E. will agree.

P.M. Why can’t they now?

J. Only “special occasions”. Give Police a much wider discretion.

P.M. What is size of problem?

C.E. Special extensions are frequent outside Ldn.

P.M. Why shd. these few (4 or 5) bulk so large in tourist traffic?

C.E. Agree tht. extension of “special occasion” extension, w’out legisn. wd. solve this.

R.S.C. Politically impossible to alter Bill now.

But good thing if means cd. be devised of enabling restaurants and clubs to keep open for late dancing pretty well all thro’ the week.

These places will all have to become clubs.

332

W.W. Must do this, if at all, by administration devices.

P.M. Doubtful about urging more concessions on “special occasions”.

There is some economic point in this – cp. our interference with working class sports. Also, if it became widespread, it wd. keep the neighbours awake. Nor is it good for people to dance until 2 am.

Agreed : leave solution to administration!
