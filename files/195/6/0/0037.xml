C.M. 41 (48) 22nd June, 1948

1. Dockers Strike.

C.E. Two mtgs. at dock gates this a.m. at wh. Leaders have said men can go to Albert Hall mtg. (10.30) or Victoria Park as they please.

Handed in report of Emergencies Cttee (Offl.) on state of affairs in docks. Perishables: details from report. These must be moved Wed. If strikes continues &amp; no volunteers come fwd., 300 troops + 150 lorries (ready) will have to be used. If it goes on, more diffy. Nos. of ships immobilised. Losing 170.000 $ a day in shopping costs &amp; exports delayed.

No. of troops requd if all work at docks has bn. taken on (p.2)

Only 40 trained stevedores available from Services. They wd. have to instruct others.

If strike extends to meat markets, another 5.000 men wd. be required and 3.000 vehicles. Services cd. deploy in 10/14 days.

x/ If strike doesn’t end to day, we must move perishables at once &amp; instruct Services to begin deployment of other men &amp; vehicles.

N.E. We have bn. in touch with Deakin, who hopes for right result from Albert Hall Mtg. Didn’t think he cd. get it from a mtg. in Vict. Park. He won’t try to get volunteers.

Confined to Ldn., in spite of efforts to extend. Has spread to cold storage (labourers).

Cause. Breach of discipline 3 times: went to Joint Inspn Cttees who appd 3/4 a ton (v. demand for 5/=). Men refused to attend Dock Labour Cttee. Disciplinary Cttee suspended them 2 wks. &amp; cut them off from guar. week &amp; benefits for 13 wks. Went to Appeal Cttee &amp; there was disagreemt. Ques. whr. both acts of penalties shd. have bn. involved. Special tribunal then apptd &amp; reduced period of both penalties to 2 wks: but in which men had come out on strike.

E.B.’s view: penal machinery more harshly applied in Ldn. than elsewhere. But no case for strike.

Some shop-stewards (Tooley Sp.) have advised men to go back on Wed.

Men are seekg. way of returng. w’out loss of face. Cd. we say H.M.G. will lend good offices if asked in examing. penal machinery – if mtg. goes well.

P.M. Can’t yield to threat. We &amp; T.U. wd. lose control.

Must therefore act at x/ if strike goes on.

A. Weak leadership by T.U.

N.E. Feared Comm. wd. defeat offl. Union &amp; start break-away Union.

Shd. assist T. &amp; G.W. Union to re-assert their control.

196

A.B. Shdn’t we take offensive when men have returned – T.U. shd. take ballot on continuance of decasualisation. They can’t have it both ways. Make that clear: to educate the men.

We must give no sign of weakness.

N.E. Wd. like to have E.B.’s view on this.

J.S. Perishables. Scandal if it went bad. Put troops in to-morrow.

Delay of remainder is more serious. And big commitment.

15.000 on food alone. Services shd. begin to deploy.

N.E. Full &amp; detailed statement this p.m. Will submit in draft to P.M.

P.M. Unfortunate that. G.A.I. &amp; G.I. are away simultaneously.

B. No “offers” shd. be made in statement.

N.E. Offer merely to aid in re-examn of machinery if asked.

A.V.A. Machinery is O.K.: use of it is what may have bn. wrong.

Redn of award shows it.

J. Useful to have p. mortem after strikes?

Might point lessons. [Exit A.W.

N.E. Will consult G.A.I. on that.

Agreed as at x/.

[Exit B. and N.E.

2. U.K. Grain Supplies.

Bread Rationing.

J.S. Wd. add

a) Reflects no increase in wheat supplies: recognition of existing situation. All planning based on 103.000 t. p. wk. off-take: now approaching that.

Want therefore to remove ineffective l.u. system &amp; replace it by system of allocation to millers. This shd. be made clear to public opinion here &amp; abroad. Allocn will be based on use in pre l.u. period. Harvest prospects in W. Europe so good that no unfavourable reaction is likely from there.

b) substitution.

P.M. Later.

J.S. Announcement 1/7.

197

R.S.C. Diff. situation. About early July shall have to re-adjust import p’mme. We have bn. letting up eg. on petrol, clothing etc., - &amp; given impression tht. things are getting easier. People abroad will assume this is a relaxation. If soon after we have to make cuts eg. in tobacco there will be misunderstandg. Wd. prefer therefore tht. this shd. be done at same time as any new cuts. Do it all at once, as part of a coherent plan.

Import p’mme must be considered early July.

A.V.A. What staff is engaged on l.u. system?

N.B. Supported R.S.C. Canada will be awkward.

A.B. Can’t consider independently of E.R.P. Refer timing to E.P.C.

R.S.C. No objn in principle so long as allocation system controls bulk consumption.

Agreed {Accept principle of abolishing rationing

{ Refer timing to E.P.C.

R.S.C. Must we take oatmeal etc. off points?

H.W. O.K. if other changes are made simultaneously.

J.S. Wd. be a discrimination re. Scotland.

N.B. Advise U.S., Canada &amp; Australia in advance.

Farmers Wheat.

J.S. Want to be sure I don’t have to buy more foreign wheat. Cd. get it: don’t want to pay for it. We have surplus of maize. Next year we mayn’t have enough. Thus, we want tempy increase in animal feed distn w’out commitment for the future.

See arguments con. It’s a ques. of balance.

My plan wd. cost £21/2 m. more: &amp; you can’t give it to farmers or animals of our choice. But diff. to defend feeding wheat to animals.

Think we cd. get thro’. Mght. mean buying some f. wheat.

R.S.C. I wd. rather leave wheat with farmers and risk having to buy more wheat.

No arguments to farmers because it’s not essential to do it.

P.M. Balance of argument is in favour of M/Ag.

A.V.A. We must aim at higher stocks than M/Ag. assumes – 13/14 wks vice 9.

H.W. Expect we may buy more. Figure won’t be so low as in M/Ag. paper.

198

Agreed: Allow farmers to retain the 20%

T.W. Want also to broaden basis of scheme, wh. is based on nos. m’tained in 1939. Want to encourage new-comers.

150.000 t. for this purpose wd. satisfy H/C. – out of 600.000 surplus. Wd. make us safe to Apl. 1950: with reasonable basis for purchase.

P.M. Will you be able to feed the additional nos. thus provoked?

T.W. Only 150.000 of excess 600.000. Seems safe to Apl. ’50.

Only risk is too much breeding.

H.D. Bound up with import p’mme.

R.S.C. T.W. assumes we buy normal quantities. No means to buy from Argentine anything. Must assume no coarse grains fr. Argentine next year.

T.W. Hope for 11/2m. tons fr. Russia.

H.W. E. Europe grains sitn is now such tht. we can expect to get somethg. from there. Even assumg. nothg. from Argentine we ought to get thro’. If we are 100 pessimistic, no breeding can start. Can never expand if we are over cautious. Look at our excess stocks now – which are embarrassing in any discns with U.S.

T.W. Diffies too with storage.

J.S. And risk of deterioration.

R.S.C. We bought 21/4 m tons this year. 50% came fr. Argentine and we can’t get that again.

T.W. I can take that risk.

A. And m’while we shall be making bacon &amp; eggs.

[Enter C.J.

Agreed: Use 150.000 tons to broaden basis.

No objn to early announcement.

3. British Nationality Bill.

A. In spite of consultns cdn’t remove objn of Opposn leaders to

i. Citizenship of U.K. and Colonies. Prompted by white settlers, they fear this may make black man uppish. They therefore carried “B. subject of U.K. &amp; Colonies” &amp;

199

which is inconsistent with scheme agreed with Doms. for each member of group to have own citizenship.

ii. Eire provisions. Liberty of resident in Eire to opt for retaining B. naty. Salisbury said people wdn’t know &amp; wd. fail to exercise the option. But Cl. 3. enables him, tho’ he didn’t opt, to have all the advantages.

They have been moved in ‘B. subject’ in place of ‘citizen’ throughout.

P.M. They will disrupt the Commonwealth. We must rub that in.

J. Irresponsible.

C.E. Discussed with Dom. P.M.’s. Devised means of meeting Comm. objns to ‘British subjects’ &amp; the Opposn have turned it upside down.

N.B. Doubt if Tories in H/C. will fight this.
