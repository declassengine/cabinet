C.M. 4(48). 15th January, 1948.

1. Foreign Travel and Basic Petrol Ration.

H.G. Wd. v. much like to restore basic. Pol. &amp; adminve diffies of

m’taining rationing w’out any basic.

But 3 pre-condns as in memo.

Dollars: saving secured (as in memo).

Supply: recently reviewed by Cab. on basis of tanker diffies. For

next few months little hope of getting oil we want. U.S.

tankers coming in more strongly &amp; trouble at Haifa. Tho’ in

last resort, we cd. get it by forcing cos. to starve some of their

markets. In second half of ’48 posn will be easier qua tankers.

Tho’ supply &amp; dollars will still be tight.

Adminn: enquiry (under Russell Vick) into black-market. Diff. will

be not diagnosis but cure.

No ques. of restoring it at once. But if M. Aid given big pressure for it.

Must therefore prepare – as we are doing on “adminn ” enquiries.

P.M. Will be suggd tht. people who can’t motor at home can go abroad &amp;

use sterling petrol there.

H.G. Only ¼ or ⅓rd of basic ration is going to soft currency markets abroad.

R.S.C. We must keep Europ. economies going: they wd. otherwise have to

buy dollar petrol. Essence of Marshall is tht. soft-currency

countries shd. help themselves as much as poss.

B. But many of these countries are easier on rationing than we.

H.G. Because they can’t control Black Market.

R.S.C. They pay soft-currency for it abroad: but dollars here.

H.G. Agree it’s diff. to get over. H/C. so far has accepted “political” (F.O.)

argument.

A.W. Can you relieve hardship e.g. for miners &amp; agric. workers’ bikes.

H.G. Is given for going to work.

Real diffy. = where you draw the line. Social purposes in rural areas

can’t be met w’out anomalies.

B. Nothing but basic will really meet this.

Wd. cost 5 tankers to restore it all. Tanker diffy. won’t prevent

restoration later in the year.

Try for restored basic, by cutting E. &amp; S. allowances.

T.W. Para. 8. Increase in commercial use. This is direction in which to

secure savings.

23

A.B. Diff. P.R. point. But is it escapable?

F.O. want inter-commn in Europe: so do Labour Party.

Ty. want to announce it now, qua negotn, tho’ travel won’t begin

until May.

Face the fact tht. we can’t hope to hold basic petrol until end/48.

Adminve enquiry may save, via abuses, equivalent of basic ration.

Anyway can’t hold posn tht. any spiv can get petrol while respectable

citizens can’t.

R.S.C. Can’t pledge dollars now for later in summer.

H.M. Taken months to get public to realise our econ-diffies. If we let

up now ( ? on either) public will assume things are easier &amp;

we’ll never re-convince them.

Travel: will public realise reasons why one country and not another.

Petrol: means giving way to campaign. Black-market is disgrace.

We shdn’t accept it. Shd. be fought on its merits.

Moment is not ripe for any breach in “austerity war”.

R.S.C. Will you deny all relief because diffy. of explaining why you can’t

give more?

F. travel (on basis of no dollars or gold) shd. be explicable.

A.W. Max Intrator – idle rich &amp; loafers. Impression tht. these are the

travellers.

R.S.C. £35 limit. It’s not the rich who will benefit.

P.M. English hotels will complain – favour to foreign competitors.

H.W. Make it condn tht. no cars are used by tourists, either way.

Tho’ we shd. allow dollar tourists to bring cars.

A.B. You won’t hold this posn in summer.

P.M. May be able to explain the dollar-earning element in this.

H.W. Make a proportn of the £35 payable only in vouchers. Limit on cash

will help.

P.M. Money put up by friends abroad.

H.W. Tourist earnings in ’48 shd. be record. 125.000 dollar passages already

booked. Tourist Bd. say – hotels can’t carry on because not

getting home trade because lack/petrol. Sample: 200 hotels.

Stratford 70% down cpd. ’47. Many closed or closing. Losing

staff; won’t get them back. Shall therefore lose millions of

dollars this year because U.S. tourists won’t stay and even more

in ’49 because they won’t come again. They wd. spend 30 m.

dollars in U.K. alone w’out purchases of presents or dollars on

24

steamer &amp; aircraft fares.

H.G. Ques. is – will hotels open again in summer? They prob. will. But

because lost earnings won’t make themselves as comfortable.

Will they recover staff?

T.W. Staff movemt. is more than seasonal.

G.A.I. If we place them in industry we shan’t want to send them back.

G.T. Support R.S.C. on educational grounds. Can’t distinguish easily

betwn. ordinary tourists &amp; educational travellers. But, if no

relaxn, shall have to consider special facilities for educational

exchanges. Don’t want exceptional treatment.

H.McN. Problem of presentn.

But if basic cd. be restored by June/July &amp; we had not arranged for

f. travel, we shd. then have another kind of problem.

Large nos. of workers &amp; m/class who have no car but went abroad

pre-war. These will make the opposite complaint – cars for

rich &amp; no travel for us.

J. Mistake to let up anything now. Coming diffies of summer months.

P.M. I can’t convince myself, let alone public, that it is sense to sell

sterling oil to soft-currency countries.

R.S.C. Decided ad hoc in bi-lateral deals wtr. we gain on balance. Same

with coal &amp; other commodities.

P.M. But we don’t buy coal for U.K. in dollars.

A. Figures are disconcerting. These sales are not new because of

Marshall or O.N.C. negotiation. They are standing practice of

oil cos. And fact is we are selling to soft-currency countries in

Europe more than we wd. be using in U.K. for basic.

H.G. B. cos. don’t produce enough for all sterling area. 1½ m. tons

deficit. They export to f. countries about 2 m. tons.

Gross deficit of 3½ m. tons comes fr. dollar sources.

But sale of this oil to soft is same as sale of coal. Loses dollars.

Can you remove it? a) Not certain we can order all the cos.

Shell e.g. = half Dutch. b) Getting something in exchange.

c) Political: if we crippled economy of w. Europe stiff

re-actions in U.S. Inconsistent with Marshall.

H.W. Oil is not under control. Unrequited export to e.g. France.

Ques. is mainly wtr. we can stop it or get value for it.

R.S.C. Don’t want to stop supply to France for reason c).

25

And academic anyway because being lifted in Fr. tankers.

P.M. Discussion illustrates “presentn ” diffy.

A. C.R.O. points. a) Doms. will be critical of relaxn of travel ban esp. for

Switzerland. We have pressed them to cut dollar expenditure:

must therefore have an understanding with Doms. in advance.

b) Eire. talks with de Valera : persuaded him to

introduce ban on f. travel &amp; it’s due to come into operation now!

c) Minor diffies with S. Africa.

Thus, no announcemt. w’out consultn with Doms. and reserve position

of Switzerland.

R.S.C. Then no chance of trade agreement with Switzerland.

And will cost us gold on the trade agreement.

E.B.’s point.

A.B. Agree. You can’t really pursue policy of pol. union of w. Europe

while we all remain in Purdah.

A. Restrict it to “nearer European countries”.

R.S.C. Wd. be hostile to Switzerland. Not even to try for agreement.

And do you want to cut out Italy.

P.M. Presentn. Elaborate need for inter-commn?

R.S.C. Prs. best to let E.B. make a vague &amp; incidental reference in his

x/ F. Affairs speech. Get away from context of petrol, hotels etc.

Get it into cultural, w. European context.

McN. Will submit draft to R.S.C.

H.M. I’m still against it.

G.A.I. So am I. Austerity needed to make chaps work.

T.W. Favour it on R.S.C.’s basis at x/.

G.T., H.W., A.B.} Favour.

J. Wobbled: into agreement.

A. Favoured as at x/.

A.W. Want a quid pro quo to show to workers.

Agreed: as at x/ } Exit H.G. McNeil

Care in presentn.} Barnes.

Enter N. &amp; Freeman

26

2. Civil Aviation. Tudor I. Enquiry.

H.M. Report shd. be published w’out delay.

Can’t get agreemt. in time on route on wh. Tudor is to be used.

Hence formula in para. 4.

Debate in H/L. Wed. next. Likely to be partly on this. Will prob. be

also demand for debate in H/C.

P.M. x/ in para. 3. skates over direct conflict of view betwn. M/C.A. &amp; M/S.

So does para. 4.

Will these differences be concealed?

Bound to be controversy over ordering.

N. S.I.M. Cttee meet to-morrow. May be able to reach accommn.

In any event in H/L. I shall be speakg. for Govt. as a whole.

Shall say procedure is evolving &amp; not yet fixed.

Can deal with ques. in general terms.

R.S.C. Believe some adjustment in ordering is necessary. But diffies between

Dpts. are not irreconcilable.

A.B. Statements by B.O.A.C. cause the trouble.

N. Procedure changed since Courtenay report.

A.W. Will this create enough confidence in Tudor to cause f. countries to

order it?

R.S.C. Their doubts can best be removed by flying them across Atlantic.

N. B.O.A.C. will use all Tudors. Only ques. is use on N. Atlantic.

I have impressed on them need to show the world tht. they can fly it. Believe they may agree to do so, for a limited time.

Fr. Report may now be released to A.V. Roc?

P.M. Yes. [Exit N. &amp; Freeman

3. Political Activities of Civil Servants.

R.S.C. As in memo.

Will consider composn with P.M.

A.B. My diffies – local govt. May I have chance of putting my views

re composn.

G.A.I. Who will give evidence?

27

R.S.C. Officials, not Ministers.

H.M. Need for care. What may we get out of this Rpt.

A.B. Easier to handle Dpt. by Dpt.? Danger of generalised answer.

P.M. Powerful Cttee may be a Balaam.

A.B. Can Cab. consider again, when names are known?

P.M. Agreed.
