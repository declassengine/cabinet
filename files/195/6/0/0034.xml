C.M. 35(48). 3rd June, 1948.

1. Ministers’ Summer Holiday.

P.M. Ministers’ holidays.

R.S.C. 5 yr. p’mme for E.R.P. 2nd week of Sept.

2. Mr. Dalton.

P.M. Welcomed return to Cabinet.

3. Parliament.

H.M. Business for next week.

4. Capital Punishment.

C.E. Cl. 1. deleted by large majority in H/L. Cab. must consider action.

Some criticism tht. my action re reprieves was unconstitutional.

That issue not raised in H/C. or earlier in H/L. Propose no

change.

Goddard advised H/L. to close minds to compromise. But in other

quarters it’s felt tht. shd. be poss. to find via media. Wd it be

useful to consider some compromise to put to Party mtg.

J. has considered some &amp; consulted me. And has leads for

new Cl. wh. cd. be submitted, now or later. Bill won’t return to

H/C. for a month: but must consult Party m’while on a draft

Clause.

P.M. Party divided. Country on whole more against Cl. than for it.

Chorley (Pres. of Abolition Socy) wd. apply. accept a

compromise.

A. H/L. as a whole wd. accept compromise – limiting extent. Goddard

isn’t repve of majority. Favour compromise.

J. Quoted Chorley – end of speech in H/L.

Att-Genl. wd. be ready to accept compromise on these lines.

P.M. General view of public. Do Cab. agree with my view?

H.D. &amp; others. Yes. (T.W., G.T., H.M.).

H.M. Must find a way out. Parlt. Bill: our policy is to secure that

popular opinion prevails over H/L. Awkward therefore if we

don’t find a way of giving effect to current popular view on this.

177

W.W. Some change in Party view since H/C. vote. Not v. much. But

consultn on these lines may bring them to majority support of

a compromise.

P.M. Compromise wasn’t before Party before.

Any change must be by Govt. not by yielding to H/L.

Cd. C.E. get into touch with Benson etc., &amp; test their views.

A. Danger of allowing H/L. to express popular view v. H/C.

R.S.C. Act quickly before views consolidate in Party circles.

E.B. Cab. shd. decide - &amp; quickly – to give Party a lead.

A.B. Prepd to support, in circs., a compromise.

But must contest argument about Gallup Poll etc., straw votes.

P.M. { Ch. Whip &amp; C.E. to take informal soundings in H/C.

{ Sub-Cttee to work out new Clause.

{ Cab. Monday next: Party mtg. Wed. next.

R.S.C. In circs. wd. be ready to support reasonable compromise.

If we decide that to-day, I &amp; others can help in Lobbies at once.

Exact details can wait.

Agreed – on this basis. [Exit C.E.

5. Parliament Bill.

A. Cross-Bench opinion apprehensive of posn if they reject Bill on Wed.

I want to make posn of Oppn as diff. as possible.

If Bill is rejected, door is shut to any amendmt.

Cross Benches want to give 2nd Rdg. &amp; seek for acceptable amendmt.

Halifax is apprehensive of Tory intransigence.

The 9 mos. wd. suffice for Gas Bill – he agreed. [Exit H.W.

I will be asked what Govt. wd. accept in Cttee if 2nd Rdg. given.

May I offer tht. we wd. introduce our alternative formula?

That wd. rally reasonable support.

P.M. Not so far as that. Say we have bn. accommodating &amp; wd. have bn.

ready to put proposals to our Party. You shd. be reasonable &amp;

give 2nd Rdg. Then we will see what can be done. But don’t

promise.

A.B. Will be diffies in Party. Bitterness now. Feeling we are going from

weak posn to a weaker one. H/L. are askg. for time limits wh.

restore their power of challenge.

Cab. has never approved these proposals. Tho’ L.P. gave Scarboro’

impn tht. W. Paper had Cab. authority.

178

H.M. These discns were reported to Cab. What is in doubt is attitude of

Party. And all was “ad referendum” to them.

E.B. Cab. agreed to back 9 mos. formula in approach to Party – if

agreemt. reached with Party Leaders.

A.B. All tentative.

P.M. But we were authorised to put this formula fwd. – on basis tht. if

agreemt. reached we as a Cab. wd. recommend it to Party.

A.B. My advice is to proceed now on basis tht. all this is dead because

agreemt. not reached in Party Leaders’ Conference.

Much opposn in Executive. And in Unions.

H.M. In H/L. debate, there will be divisions of opinion. Cross Bench may

want to keep issue open until Cttee. Govt. will have to say wtr.

they are ready to talk in Cttee.

Party Conference debated wtr. Govt. shd. be free to go on discussing.

They carried “prev. ques.” – meant they wanted or were willing that Govt. shd. go on discussing. Executive authd me to say tht.

had concurred in discns at Party Leaders Confce &amp; were willing

for Govt. to have free hand to go on.

All was subject to Party mtg. Govt. doesn’t fall therefore if Party

won’t have it in the end.

P.M. Let A. say: 2nd R. = approval genl. principle. On detail Govt. always

ready consider amendmts in Cttee. We wd. therefore consider

proposals: tho’ no promise to accept.

E.B. | Say Govt. willing to consider any amendmt wh. doesn’t destroy

x | effectiveness of H/C. up to &amp; incldg. 4th Session of Parlt.

| Make it clear tht. this = objective of Salisbury.

A.V.A. Was originally against these negotns &amp; we have got into diff. posn

as a result.

Fundamental tht. reply shd. not promise fundamental change in Bill

as it left H/C. w’out consultn with Party.

P.M. We have stood for 4th Session. We can stand by that still. But don’t

exclude in advance amendments w’in that.

A.B. Ques. of timing shdn’t be allowed to prejudice reform of compn.

I wd. give less time to a revising Chamber.

P.M. I take opp. view. It is because this House asserts itself against H/C. tht.

I believe time shd. be short.

If you can get rid of element of challenge, it becomes a much more

‘minor’ affair.

179

A.W. Expediency: better to get Bill thro’ this Session. May have to have

Genl. El. earlier.

H/L. haven’t used these powers for 36 years. If we have 2nd term we

shan’t have so big a majority. Thus – get this reform effectively

secured in this Parliament.

A. V. doubtful wtr. we shall get 2nd Rdg. on any basis. But I’m content

with formula at x/.

A.B. Record my view tht. this is w’out prejudice to any ques. of time-limit

for a revising Chamber.

P.M. Very Well.

H.M. Shd. be mentioned at Party meeting on Wed.

A.B. Hope ques. of composn won’t be resurrected.

H.M. I hope it will.

P.M. Anyway all that wd. have to come to Party.

[Exit W.W.

6. Anglo-Egyptian Conversations on Sudan.

E.B. Talks in Cairo since 10/5.

Condominium uncertain. If we were taken to Intern. Ct. we shd. prob.

be ousted.

Egyptian opinion in favour of settlement – Nokrashi is diff.

Sudanese .. rising.

Have suggested a) 2 nominated Egyptians on Council.

b) electoral system: Anglo-E-Commn

c) progress to self-govt.

This was agreed. But Nokrashi is now insistg. on parity for E. in

the adminn. This I have refused.

Promised Sudan to issue 24/5: extended up to Mon. next.

Ques: if E. still holds out, may we go on alone with

promulgn of Ordinance. Wd be illegal; but doubt if E.

wd. challenge it. Recommend we take the risk. Otherwise

we lose support of Sudanese.

No risk of being taken to U.N. Only to Internl Court.

C.J. Support this.

Agreed.

7. Palestine.

A. Strabolgi has put Motion for Tues. on Palestine.

Salisbury says his people wd. like an innings on this – pro Arab.

180

E.B. Any debate now, taking sides, wd. be fatal. Must give Mediator a

chance. And he reports to Sec. Council. It isn’t we who now

have to decide.

A. V. well: I will bat it off.

[Enter G.S.

8. Steel Scrap from Germany.

P.M. V. disquieting. Long time. Thought Loch was to appointed [sic] weeks ago.

G.S. Organisation going well. But discns with U.S., delays of J.E.I.A.

At best we shall be ½ m. tons short in year starting 1.7.48.

We must take it up with Harriman.

R.S.C. V. serious situation. German – currency ques. But U.S. have

butted in &amp; are seeking maximum for E.R.P. purposes. And

our prospects are v. poor. Doubt if we shall get this in time

anyhow. Recommend scratchg. around everywhere &amp; not

relying wholly on Germany.

A.B. We have stepped up steel prodn w’out enough scrap.

R.S.C. Long-term solution must be expanding pig-iron: &amp; that is in hand.

G.S. By 1952 we shall be indep. of foreign scrap. But problem is scrap

for intervening years.

Final Rpt. of Cunningham Cttee: want it up at E.P.C.

P.M. “Other sources” – there aren’t any.

E.B. Give me informn so I can keep going at Douglas.

R.S.C. Can do more to collect scrap in U.K. Gareloch output cd. be doubled

if man power increased by making one of 3 existg. camp

available.

G.S. Will enquire. But have expanded the ship-breaking organn already.

H.M. Tram-lines – lying there because uneconomic. M/T. shd. contribute

as part of highway reconstruction.

Another report in a month or less.

Constant pressure on Douglas.

Report w’in a week on Gareloch.

9. Social Services in W. Europe.

E.B. As in memo.

181

A.B. More time. Our machine is strained to limit.

E.B. Will arrange date to meet your convenience.

J.G. Some done already e.g. agreemt. with France.

But must be able to do it when &amp; as we can.

E.B. But keep W. Union in balance.

Only want approval in principle.

G.T. Going on now, with F.O. – esp. Anglo-French.

Surprised at extent of this.

J.G. W’out prejudice to reciprocals w’in B. Commonwealth.

E.B. Agree: at Comm. Confce wd. wish to report all W. Union moves

&amp; give impn we are moving pari passu with Commonwealth.

Agreed.

Proposed Exhibition.

E.B. Cttee recommend films vice Exhibitions.

H.M. C.O.I. haven’t bn. able to consider.

Can E.B. &amp; I be authd to examine &amp; submit to Brussels any

practical plan.

N.B. Give Fr. material for Exhibition if they want to stage one.

E.B. Ours wdn’t come out well in Exh. run by the French.

10. Conference on Freedom of Information.

R.S.C. Art. 3. Wd prevent Lobby Confce w’out inviting foreign Press.

H.M. Impossible.
