C.M. 13 (48) 12th February, 1948

1. Parliament.

[Enter W.W.

H.M. Business for next week.

2. Representation of the People Bill.

P.M. City/London will make formal repns. Stand on principle: may be room for compromise on geography!

[Exit W.W.

3. Oswald Mosley: Application for Passport.

E.B. O. Mosley applied for ppt. D. Reg. 18. no longer ground for refusing, since 21/12.

Going abroad to join Pirow, Lindburgh etc. in S. Africa to form anti-comm league.

Have refused a ppt.

Indications that some people will raise issue of freedom.

Want support of Cab. if there is trouble over this.

4. India: Security Council.

Indians flying back for further instns.

E.B. They missed the plane. Discussions in Security Council are continuing.

Diff. situation, however.

K. Menon’s activities are not helpful. Czech nominee is prob. Communist.

Prs. a mistake to be represented at Sec. Council. Our attitude is being misrepresented. Better if we had used Canada’s representative.

5. Western Union.

E.B. Must begin slowly &amp; carefully,

Fr. line: take it or leave it. Can’t be so rough with Benelux. Must remember Rio &amp; Satellite Treaties made since Dunkirk Treaty – and have interesting features.

Favour meetg. of principles to give dirns for detailed work by officials.

Not dipl. channel.

Considering Council for Europe under wh. consultative Cttee cd. be grouped.

Am preparing memo. on that.

Ultimate aim – finance &amp; banking = W. Europe shd. come together on that -? Reg. Monetary Fund. Socialised steel industries = and for integrating industry for W. Europe =

67

distributing various parts of the industry where most econ. &amp; eff. prodn.

Diffies in social services. Wd. like to see M/H. M/L. and M/N.I. to discuss means of promoting uniformity.

[Exit C.E.

E.B. Unifying effect: don’t confine it to economic &amp; defence ques.

Provide for Council in first Treaty: &amp; begin to develop under it.

Colonial dependencies. Don’t let’s use term “Colony” – overseas territories.

Will seek concurrence of Fr. to move twds. Conference in early March.

P.M. Also get away from term “Dunkirk Treaty”.

What is idea of Treaty? Start on Dunkirk model?

E.B. Put it in merely as basis for discussion. Ready however to evolve from it. Study Art. 53. May evolve into Regional affair.

Have told France I’m not going into this in dogmatic fashion - &amp; that they mustn’t bully Belgium etc., We must go into this on terms of equality.

P.M. Basis of Dunkirk was defence v. Germany.

E.B. Must refer to Germany but not make it a basis.

A. x/ Useful if E.B. cd. draw proposals on basis indicated. Wd. serve to remove misapprehensions of Doms.

Doms. wd. prefer Art 52 approach vici Dunkirk.

N.Z. &amp; Canada welcome U.K. invitation. S.A. dislike Dunkirk approach. Australians are apprehensive: wd. like it confined to Europe – India might feel the same.

E.B. If they mean defence, we haven’t proposed it.

R.S.C. But on economics, they must come in.

Repeated x/. Wd. be v. helpful if we cd. explain this to Doms. before the Conference. Statement of genl. objectives.

H.M. What are we being commd to? What was content of Dunkirk Treaty? U.N. Charter? Rio?

Have C.O.S. considered mil. implications?

Wd. have liked more time &amp; more informn.

What machinery to supervise economic negotiations? Incldg. repercussions on Africa &amp; Doms.

Can we have a memo. on methods &amp; machinery as well as aims?

A.V.A. On defence, wd. be premature to discuss with C.O.S. They are still studying it, after talk with P.M. &amp; E.B.

68

E.B. Intend submit memo. next week on machinery.

Will separate this from Marshall Cttee. It is wider.

Have told F.O. to work out somethg. new in consultn with Dpts.

Head up with another London Cttee, wh. wd. report direct to Cabinet.

Objectives. Don’t want to inform Doms. in advance because may not succeed in achieving them. I can’t get Evatt to agree to anything. Why try? Other Doms. are satisfied.

A. Wd. remove much misgivings tht. this is all military.

H.M. Let CRO &amp; Doms. read my speech. Never stressed defence aspect.

E.B. Art. IV of Dunkirk. This is one operative Art. so far.

A.W. Will Germany be brought in?

E.B. Yes: eventual aim.

A.B. Ques.: under what auspices?

a) Dunkirk. Gather it over emphasis mil. defence v. Germany.

b) Regional under Charter. Can’t we go for some third method, wh. will give most emphasis to economic side? Stress E.B.’s memo. tht. we mustn’t work for divided Europe.

E.B. I wd. talk, without Treaty. But can’t carry France with me in that. They are pre-occupied with security v. Germany.

Must put Dunkirk at least as basis to get France into discussions at all.

Benelux also dislike being sub-ordinated to France.

If I can get France talking, they can be brought round.

R.S.C. Endorse this approach. Also speed. Can’t predict yet ultimate result.

H.W. E.B.’s oral statement puts more emphasis on economic ques. than his memo.

Will machinery memo. be fwd. before Conference opens?

E.B. Next week.

H.W. In official talks we understood economic side was to be played down at outset.

A. This is Doms. apprehension. Want E.B.’s real policy to be explained.

A.B. Not too much stress on defence. de Gaulle wants to push it that way. As does W.S.C.

Must seek to get econ. aspects into forefront at outset.

69

Agree with E.B.’s oral statement: don’t feel so re-assured by his memo.

E.B. Defence is important. Effect on Budgets.

A.B. Agree. Ques. is presentation.

T.W. Mustn’t cross wires with C.E.E.C.

H.M. Can memo. cover

a) machinery for international discns Europe.

b) machinery for interdpartm. discns here.

c) what the economic aspects of this pol. are.

E.B. Yes.

P.M. General objective: in defence avoid anti-Comm. appearance.

This reason for Dunkirk model?

E.B. Yes: as a basis for discn. For accepted h’to by Russia.

But can evolve from that, in discn, into something difft.

Have told Spaak I’m open to consider Regional Scheme. But if under Art. 52 that is almost wholly military.

R.S.C. Regional I.T.O. is nearer the mark.

E.B. Yes: coupled with a defence wing.

A.B. Really a matter of presentation.

P.M. Must avoid misrepn, as soon as mtg. called.

E.B. Want it quickly.

R.S.C. Link it with your H/C speech.

Memo approved.
