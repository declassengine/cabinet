[Enter B., J.S., G.S.

6. Economic Affairs.

R.S.C. Prodn increase beginning to tail off. Engineering: ceramics

increases in 1st quarter.

Coal production still disquieting. Most serious aspect = shortage of

large coal for export. Excess of unwashed (and unwanted)

smalls.

E.B. Mtg. of N.U.M. Seemed to be good-will. V. placid.

G.A.I. Getting all the men they can take. Esp. E.V.W.’s. In Yorks. some

hostility to workg. with foreigners. In Scotland, where no

hostility, no houses. Detailed report is going to Prodn Cttee.

………………………….

R.S.C. Balance of Payments. Net increase of 32 m. due to price increases.

On volume near estimate. If we get E.R.P. re-imbursement

we should roughly balance. But we shall prob. get less. esp.

in future quarters. Must therefore reduce draft on sterling

reserves. Under better control – Hong Kong, Siam, Burma,

W. Indies etc., were[sic] are still trying to get in hand.

A.B. Any dollar cost over Berlin?

R.S.C. Depends on arrangemt. made for oil.

then crash.

Marshall Plan pumps wages in &amp; draws goods away. That is

inflationary.

R.S.C. Retail Trade. New feature. Diff. to interpret figures.

Wanted to see if signs of deflation. Para. 37. Not v. much

disinflation as yet. No grds. for anxiety lest deflation shd.

set in hard.

H.W. Disinflation is on the move, but not enough to cause alarm.

E.g. traffic is dropping (C. Paterson).

But we have bn. trying to create this situation.

B. This is what alarms me re increase in coal prices.

R.S.C. No genl. increase intended? Differentiated price only.

And can raw materials be denied?

H.W. Too difficult. Consumer re-action is more effective.

Prices.

R.S.C. Internal level has flattened out. And wages steady 3 months.

If engineering &amp; agric. claims cd. be held, there might be

a recession in price level.

G.A.I. Engineering claim comes up on 14/7. Unions inclined twds.

Court of enquiry. Won’t go to arbitn. Want peaceful

settlement.

Agriculture – outside M/L. control.

R.S.C. Cab. shd. consider wtr. agric. wages shdn’t come under normal

machinery. Road haulage is now coming back. This is

chance to get agric. back to normal.

General support for this.

R.S.C., T.W. &amp; G.A.I. shd. confer on this ques.

G.A.I. Unions. Transpt. wd. have piece-work system. Agric. unions don’t

want it.

Oil Stocks.

A.V.A. Are forecasts June/July firm? We ought to improve them.

R.S.C. But U.S. aren’t delivering v. contract. We are on the bone.

procdg. in W’ton.

A.V.A. Naval stocks have bn. run down to assist civil.

R.S.C. Whole problem shd. be handled with U.S. on political level.

Includg. artificial raising of price by U.S.A.

E.B. Only hope of U.S. co-opn is on defence grounds. They won’t

discuss on commercial basis. 233
