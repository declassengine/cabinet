C.M. 73(48) 15th November 1948

[Enter A.H., H.Mc.N. &amp; Strong

1. Berlin : Intervention of Dr. Evatt.

P.M. E.B. was seen y’day. Read out statement of his views.

Evatt doesn’t like this confined to Gt. Powers – wants others in.

Cuts across way it’s being handled.

Mc.N. Evatt has indicated for some time tht. he cd. handle this ques. better than C.F.M. or Sec. Council. He asked Bramnglia to sign it, and he refused.

Bramnglia is about to put a new solution to Sec. Council.

Believe U.S. and France will reject Evatt’s suggn.

Handed round U.S. draft reply.

Diff. to believe Evatt’s primary interest is to settle – personal grandeur.

H.M. What constitutional right have Evatt and Lie to send these messages on own responsibility – across deliberations of organs. of U.N. If that is right, ought we not to take the point?

P.M. Bases himself on Assembly resolution of ’48. (Nov 3rd.)

R.S.C. Legitimate for President to do this. May have bn. unwise.

A.W. Wise not to snub him.

P.M. I am bound to send him personal reply.

Mc.N. Appropriate for him to send Resoln. to Govts. and he cd. add comments.

Secy. Genl. has odd powers.

My advice wd. be not to take this point against him.

No evidence that E. is doing this because has heard that Gov. ready for a new move. (in reply to H.D.).

N.B. Heard in Paris this had bn. started by Sov.

Mc.N. That was gossip – object tht. Sov. may be taken off hook of their Veto in Security Council.

A.B. If R. are anxious to get out of Berlin ques. in order to discuss genl. German situation, then E’s intervention becomes intelligible.

Not inconsistent with our attitude tht. we won’t discuss genl. ques. under duress.

R.S.C. Evatt suggests a) immediate conversations b) assistce. to Bramnglia

We are doing b) : can’t do both at once.

300

P.M. Agree : our line of reply shd. be to say we are doing this in Sec. Council and must go on there. Grateful for any help : but as we are near a solution in Sec. Council we prefer to follow it up there thro’ For. Ministers.

Mc.N. Consult other Govts. on draft? Yes.

Agreed : reply on these lines.

[Exit A.H. and Strong.

2. Commonwealth Relations : Eire and India.

J. Described Sunday’s conversns. in Paris.

Evatt beginning to realise the diffies.

Fraser anxious we shd. not appear to drive Eire out.

We invited Irish to come and talk. They have accepted and are coming over to Paris this pm.

In afternoon we discussed India on basis of Legal Opinion. Attendance. Fraser stressed importance of keeping India.

I told them we wanted their help and advice on this – so we cd. all go fwd. together. They promised to try.

Mtg. had good effect – they realise diffies.

N.B. At outset all 3 were hoping tht. we cd. keep Eire in. At end they realised E. resolved to go out. But vital to their public opinion that it shd. so appear and tht. we all have done our best …..

Note taken of position.

3. Birth of Princess Elizabeth’s Son.

P.M. Will tell H/C. today tht. I will move address tomorrow.

Not in accordance with precedent for Cab. to send a message.

H.M. Let us start a new precedent.

Agreed : message to go from Cabinet.

[Enter Brown.

4. Anglo-Norwegian Fishery Dispute.

Mc.N. As in memo.

P.M. Have we a good case?

Mc.N. Yes.

J. The pp. shd. go to L.O.’s

301

G.B. Att. Gen. has bn. consulted.

J. Make quite sure.

P.M. Let L.O.’s give us an opinion – on chances of success.

A.V.A. Effect on territorial water theory?

R.S.C. Will raise it. And must be settled one day by internatl. court.

A.V.A. Were Admy. consulted?

Mc.N. M’while, no departure from status quo.

Discuss with Foreign Minister/Norway.

Make prelimy. arrangements to go before Int. Ct.

Let Att. Genl. submit a memo.

[Exit Brown.

5. Capital Punishment.

C.E. Developments a) Wilson Harris’ P.Q.

b) Silverman resolution tht. advice on prerog. is subject to control of Parlt.

No time will be found, presumably, for (b). But satisfied tht. other means will be found of keeping this issue alive.

J. has asked W. Greene &amp; Tucker. Thinks Greene won’t do it.

Revised t. of reference.

P.M. “Other countries” is a bit wide. “Comparable f. countries”?

A.B. Do t. of r. carry out intention. First part will cover abolition, so far as other countries have abolished it. Put the reference to other countries at end. Agreed in substance.

J. Let Chairman have a sight of them before they are settled.

P.M. We are no further on ques. wthr. we can get an adequate Commn.

C.E. Shall I get him to p’pone P.Q. for a week?

H.D. Silverman won’t give you much time.

H.M. Desirable that we shd. know that we can get a decent body.

P.M. “this country”? Make it clear it is G.B.

Agreed : t. of r. as so amended might be announced on Thursday.

Report to Cab. on Thursday on composition.

302

6. Amendment of Betting Laws.

R.S.C. As in memo.

C.E. I agree. My advisers don’t. But I can see no solution other than by R. Commn.

Public opinion has prob. changed since last enquiry. The churches’ opinion may not have.

R.S.C. No church opposn. to Budget proposals.

C.E. N. Ireland recently had an enquiry. Unanimous rpt. But Govt. wdn’t legislate.

H.W. Awkward for me – because of paper control.

H.D. Leave an interval after announcement eg. R. Commn. on Cap. Punishmt.

Agreed in principle to appoint R. Commn.
