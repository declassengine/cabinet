[Enter Listowel and

7. Commonwealth Relations : Eire.

J. Eire will repeal Ext. Relations Act.

Eire will go out of commonwealth.

Only ques. : how do you mitigate the resultg. posn. The 3 questions.

E’s readiness v. nationality law.

Preferences : E. don’t care because present condns. of world trade. Try to meet posn. together; but if it can’t be done we must let them (preferences) go.

Evident tht. Can, Austr. and N.Z. take strong line tht. we must accept this posn. v “foreign”. They will do so : hope we shall. If we don’t we shall stand alone.

No commitment – But believe it’s best we can do.

MacBr. will devote himself thereafter to improving factual relationship.

N.B. Always held. Dom. had right to secede.

All made strong appeal to them to stay in. No response. How therefore to make the breach least harmful. Wasn’t open to us to present consequences as retaliatory measures. Other 3 Doms. wd. have bn. roused to gt. anger. Thrown back because on legal diffies. We expounded those. Eire answered with position offer to develop exchange of citizenship rights. Pearson doubted if m. f. u. challenge

306

wd. be made. If it is, we have some sort of case. If we lost, we cd. terminate preferences.

We had to do this. Defensible in law. Much to be said for it on merits.

R.S.C. Involves reversg. earliest decn. tht. can’t have 2 qualificns. for Comm. membership. The outer ring. Diff. kind of link. For India they will demand same treatment.

May have advantages. But we are going twds. a) Comm. b) a looser assocn.

Necessarily creating a new pattern.

P.M. Is that so. Irish history etc., And they are out.

India isn’t the same : cdn’t patch up same sort of case for them.

R.S.C. India contemplates citizenship as basis of commn.

India wd. ask for Irish pattern instead of membership of Comm.

P.M. Irish plan = series of bi-lateral agreemts. with diff. countries.

Factual posn. is quite different.

J. McBride said he had explained to Nehru tht. Eire action wdn’t affect India and Nehru hadn’t dissented.

N.B. Discussions with Bagpai. We said our case wd. be stronger if they cd. in some form continue King’s accrediting of diplomats. eg. in Canadian form – permanent commission to Gov. Genl.

Bagpai promised to pass it on to Nehru.

C.E. Belfast haven’t bn. informed. May I now tell them?

Cd. we bind N.I. Govt. in their arrangemts v.(eg.) local franchise.

I suppose not.

This may embitter feeling in the North. And may spoil their relations with us.

P.M. We must consult them.

A.B. This recognised the hard fact.

What really matters is wthr. Eire is movg. away or twds. us. I believe they are moving twds. while politicians are bowing to the past.

This expresses realities of situation.

I wd. support this – on that ground.

One embarrassmt : Will inner circle discuss defence and outer not?

P.M. Any change in our municipal law?

J. No. Unless compelled by challenge under m. f. u.

We shall do our best to repel. But Irish realise tht. if we lose, we may have to abandon the special privileges.

P.M. B. Naty. Act applied to N. Ireland? 307

C.E. Yes.

N.B. Relations betwn. Govts. in last 10 years have not bn. v. much like Comm.

MacBride says he can work for closer relations because and only because of this constitutional policy.

Put to him diffy. if U.N. accepted their appln. and made diffies. for us with Ceylon. MacB. then said that E. wd. w’draw her appln.

H.M. Macdonald made same report of his interview with de Val. re ports.

Same with my talk with de V. – give us end of Partn. and all will be well.

Unhappy. They have out-manoeuvred us.

Shdn’t settle w’out consultn. with Belfast.

Victims of other Doms.

P.M. Cd. we have done any better? We have no cards.

R.S.C. Not opposed to this. Thought it wd. be forced on us.

But need for quick statement tht. we believe there is a half-way house and make it true – a new principle in internatl. law.

P.M. Early decln. : but in terms of Eire only.

A. a) Simultaneous decln. by ourselves and 3 Doms.

b) Consult N. Ireland.

R.S.C. A new type of assocn. Cd. be extended to W. Europe.

H.D. Might well.

C.E. Date of commencemt. shd. be after 1st Jan. because B.N. Act.

N.B. We can get that.

P.M. Shd’nt. Opposn. be consulted? Agreed.

A. Salisbury is v. bitter about it.

{ a) Consult N. Ireland

{ b) Get agreemt. on draft statement – agreed with Doms.

{ c) Consult Opposn. say Eire are going out.

[Re-enter Parly Secy. [W.O.

8. Cyrenaica.

H.D. Recommend approval of annexed documents, subject to what is said about publicn.

308

Service Dpts. are satisified : so are Ty.

Art. 6. Advised there wd. be gt. suspicion if we omitted this common. form clause.

H.M. Can you hold it in practice?

C.M. Applies to all Trusteeship Agreemts.

H.D. No time limit set for limitns. on powers of Emir : might be said no hope of real independence.

Female suffrage : Emir shd. be told that Art. 40 means this. He won’t like it. We shd. then w’draw. Let him take exception.

Wh. Desire to retain over-riding power, over Emir (M/Defence).

Art. 3 of Treaty doesn’t seem to give effect to that. Concurrent powers.

H.D. We intended it.

Agreed : subject to Ld. Advocate discussg. this and other drafting points.

War Off. Want more than 10yrs. Cd. get it by Treaty with Amir if Trusteeship expires. Wd. prefer 25 yrs.

C.M. We know that. Shan’t include time limit unless we have to because of pressure in U.N.

Add Ceylon to list of Doms. to be consulted.
