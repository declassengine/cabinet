1. Mr Mackenzie King.

21/4 beats Walpole. Will send telegram. Agreed.

2. “Polish Daily”: Employment of Poles.

G.A.I. Critical posn.

Nov. printing removed from B. firm – trouble with Unions –

negotiatg. ever since. Kirkien v. awkward.

Suggd issue twice a week as periodical – to take it out of newspaper

rules. Kirkien wdn’t play, the Unions agreeable.

Kirkien doing other work – for A.B.C. &amp; dog-racing. With Poles,

unreasonably.

E.B. Know nothing about it.

M.S. Recall to P.R. Corps as method of dealing with industr. dispute is

inexpedient.

About to appeal to Poles to take work. Holding that up because this

recall wd. weaken it.

P.M. Wdn’t: we aren’t appealing to Poles to take scab work.

G.A.I. Not ques. of dispute. Ques. of enforcing Govt. pledge re condns on

wh. Poles shd. be employed.

E.B. If it violates T.U. condns I am on side of M/Labour.

I wd. tolerate no nonsense.

Let G.A.I. see me.

A.B. Many journals get produced only by dodging these T.U. rules.

They can produce this paper with 12 people; and T.U. insist on their

employing 10 more.

M.S. Only 8 of employers are subject to recall to P.R. Corps.

Agreed: support G.A.I. – in w’drawing labour.

138

4. France: Balance of Payments Deficit.

R.S.C. Grave &amp; urgent. Fr. buying sterling goods &amp; running down st.

balances at a rate wh. will exhaust them by June. They will

then be unable to buy materials. They ask for loan of

£65-68 m. to go on thus. This = unrequited exports &amp; we can’t

do it.

Discussed with E.B. Agree we can’t do it alone: suggest 5 Power talk.

E.B. Agreed. Hall-Patch is in Paris on this now.

R.S.C. Cause: Fr. trying to beat inflation by flooding in goods they can’t pay

for.

P.M. Congratns to E.B. on passing of E.R.P. Act.

5. Strike of Vehicle Makers.

G.A.I. Negotiating for some time. Break-down.

Have now referred it to Tribunal.

But Executive have decided to make it an official strike. That is

illegal. First since 1940.

Issue = 3d an hour. Has bn. hanging on since end/46.

They have a case for some increase.

E.B. Why did M/L. let it run so near to 21st day?

G.A.I. To explore all other means of settlement.

P.M. What is effect of illegality.

G.A.I. In theory we cd. prosecute.

A.V.A. Can you compel employers to go to Arbitration even tho’ there is a

strike going on.

G.A.I. Only 8-9 days ago tht. M/L. knew this was going wrong.

T.W. C.P. issuing memorials for signature incldg. demand tht. Govt. shd.

not check wages – in a list of items which has a wide appeal.

G.A.I. T.U.’s are combating Comm. with success. T.U.C. are organising

secret means of doing it.

Keep this going &amp; we’ll have them on the run.

More diff. = Trades Councils.

E.B. But mustn’t let down skilled workers like these.

Have employers been seen?

139

G.A.I. In light of Cab. discussion I will put more pressure on them to meet

men’s demand or go to Arbitratn.

A.B. Don’t want 1st show-down on this. Hoped we wd. get it with NUDOR.

E.B. You can have an enquiry (1919 Act) even while strike is procdg.

Advise G.A.I. not to intervene personally.

A.B. Simeon Rpt. (26½ % on working capital) shows scandalous state of

affairs in bldg. materials industries.
