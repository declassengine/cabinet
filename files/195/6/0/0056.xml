C.M. 71(48) 12th November 1948

1. Palestine.

P.M. Truce – broken by both. J. strong. May come in conflict with Transj. forces.

We have Treaty. Shd. we reinforce R.A.F. at Amman because risk of J. attack on T.

Yet attack may be sudden and we shd. be prepd. in advance.

Think we ought to be prepared.

A.V.A. If Truce broken and a threat to Transj own obligns. arise. Tr. forces in bad way. because we have denied them ammunition because of truce. Only 150 men at R.A.F. Regt. at Amman : cdn’t defend airstrip. Ammunn. ready to be flown in : but weather might prevent landing for days at a time.

a) Want therefore to reinforce R.A.F. and send in 30/50 tons of

x/ ammunition, to be held by R.A.F. pro tem.

J. cd. mount 60/70 planes operationally.

b) Frigates and L.S.T.’s to Aquaba.

Cd. Cab. authorise action to be taken on a day to be fixed in light of events.

C.M. E.B. supports. Danger is that J. forces in 16 Lebanon villages. Truce operatg. one sidedly : we withhold ammunn. fr. A. and J. get it fr. Czecho.

Action recommended doesn’t involve breach of truce. Wd. arise only if we handed the ammunn. over to Arabs.

Full expln. to be given to Marshall before action taken.

E.Sh. Propn. of assistg. Transj. under Treaty – no objn.

But it goes further – x/. contemplates assistce. to Arab Legion if attacked in Pal.

P.M. Various propns. put fwd. by C.O.S. x/. was not endorsed by Ministers.

Was rejected yesterday.

E.Sh. Good : but we mustn’t involve ourselves unnecessarily in trouble, the end of wh. we can’t foresee. Don’t know strength of J. Forces. Have bn. misled on this in W.O. Must be sure that if we go in we can win easily.

P.M. Our duty under Treaty is clear. If we make it clear tht. we shall do it, J. may well be deterred from rash action.

C.E. Can 150 men, even if reinforced, hold the posn.?

A.V.A. They cd. hold the airstrips if provided with this equipment.

293

A.B.&amp; H.D. Our experts have consistently misled us about relative Arab/Jews strengths.

A.V.A. Defended C.O.S. estimates. Movemt. of relative strengths in last 6 months.

N.B. R. has armed J. thro’ Czechoslovakia. Unopposed Air Force makes all the diffce.

J. Agree with proposal so long as it confined to defending Transjordan. But risk of “too little and too late”. Shd. we not make a proper job of this to provide an effective deterrent.

P.M. Forces in readiness which cd. go in if attack developed.

A.V.A. Frigate has already gone to Aquaba. Wd. like to add a garrison there.

C.M. Don’t exclude intervention W. of Jordan.

P.M. We shall not fight alone in Palestine – only as part of U.N. collective decision.

H.D. Shd. be made clear to C.O.S. and F.O. officials at home and abroad.

A.B. Suppose T. bomb J. in Pal. while T. forces still in P., shd. we regard that as attack on T.?

C.M. Haven’t so far.

P.M. But wd. depend on circs.

Can’t decide on hypothetical ques.

Must be kept v. secret. Authority given as at x/.

[Exit Service Ministers and Wright

[Enter L.O.’s.

2. Commonwealth Relations.

Eire.

P.M. Clear tht. E. becomes f. state. Legally, either f. or Br. : then all the consequences flow. Is there some intermediate position? (eg Indian wish to be a republic but stay inside). Other P.M.’s v. anxious we shd. not extrude anyone by our action. Diff. to see how to avoid such U.K. action.

A.G. No intermediate posn. Diff. to find one for India wh. wants to be in. Impose for Eire wh. wants to be out.

A. Disagree. There will be a suspensory period. Hope it will be long. In that time some settlement with India. Then don’t believe it imposs. to

294

find a middle posn. – eg. a Treaty of Assocn. distinguishing them from foreign state. Don’t despair of that.

P.M. Unfair to promise them it will be ok. unless we can see a way thro’ diffies.

J. A confusing politics and law.

Legal advisers must advise on the law, as we believe it to be. In our municipal law we can do what we like. We cd. enact tht. Eire be treated as tho’ she was w’in H.M. doms. for any particular purpose. But we can’t by our law affect internatl. law. In that law Eire will be in same posn. as f. country. Among consequ. we can’t accord to her any privileges we aren’t ready to accord to other f. countries. under bilateral Treaties. Those not in G.A.A.T. will be able to take us to ct. Then if we accord it to them we are bound to extend it to G.A.A.T. signatories.

A.G. Endorse J.’s view. Have tried hard to see a way thro’. Convinced there is no device wh. wd. enable us to satisfy Intern. ct. that a country which isn’t a member of the Comm. is not a f. state. One hope was common naty. But truth is tht. Comm. citizenship doesn’t give right to enter or share in Govt. of other Comm. countries.

Indian citizenship is eg. a disadvantage in S. Africa.

N.B. Wdn’t exclude any close association with Eire. Ready to p’pone as long as poss. But suspend provn. of Eire Act will be 6-8 wks. and Act will be passed on Wed. next.

They want to be out. Chequers : decln. tht. we don’t regard one another as foreign. Clear it was turned down by Dublin Cab.

Rugby’s memo shows tht. alternative formula involvg. membership wd. be turned down at expense of losing preferences etc.

A.B. Wdn’t Eire Govt. be glad to be helped out of diffies. they are in.

They want to cut link with Crown. They don’t want to be out. They wd. like to be helped to a means of keeping in.

P.M. They have got themselves into this mess. But it is a mess.

Diffies. In H/C. pressed to say, if we give advantages to Eire, what is value of membership.

In Canada, French Canadians. In S. Africa. …….

A.B. Eire aide memoir goes well beyond preferences – Kinship, history, blood. Don’t let the latter kill the spirit.

P.M. Internatl. law. eg. S. America : language, religion, history, pol. assocn.

eg. Arab or Muslim States, who cd. do the same.

A.B. Suppose Eire declared she did not regard herself as foreign to U.K. etc., in respect of certain things.

295

A.G. Not a matter for unilateral decision by Eire. Third party cd. bring it to internatl. court. This is precisely what m.f.u. principle forbids. A country can’t by its municipal law make itself in internatl. law other than foreign.

H.M. Two stages. a) Have we made it really clear to Eire what consequences are. Eire Ministers left Chequers thinkg. we wd. get them out of the trouble. First step shd. be to make it quite clear, in writing, that they can’t have it both ways.

Pol diffies. in U.K.

A.B. Real trouble for me is tht. if E. goes out, we shall have to defend Party.

Cdn’t we get eminent jurists on both sides to submit agreed report what effect and consequences are. Take it out of nature of U.K. retaliation.

J. I wdn’t mind.

P.M. Almost all at Chequers were lawyers.

C.E. Is there any hope they wd. accept adverse view. Wd. get us no further.

P.M. Wd. vindicate us of any charge of vindictive action.

N.B. Bill will be passed unopposed on Wedy.

R.S.C. (Not having heard precedg. argument). Point is : they don’t want to remain in.

C.E. That distinguishes Eire from India.

P.M. They say they are foreign. No good our trying to dodge that.

Only ques. is : how can you modify consequences of their being foreign.

A.B. But feeling will be exacerbated unless clear to Irish public that consequences flow fr. internatl. law, not from our ill-will.

P.M. Must also consult Comm. Ministers.

N.B. Their relations are diff. fr. others. No mtgs. No consultn. No flow of informn. No High Commrs. If they had attended recent mtg. they cdn’t have agreed to much of our conclns. and views.

Agree we shd. put the responsibility on their shoulders, not ours.

eg. MacBride interview in D. Telegraph last week.

H.M. Note shd. go to them at once. We cd. make it clear it’s a consequence of internatl. law, not our wish.

A.B. Legal conference.

Publicity – to bring it home to Irish public opinion.

296

G.T. Suspense period must be much more than 6 wks. if we are going to be able to help them.

R.S.C. We cd. disclose substance of note.

P.M. Had our talk : looked into it : now send them views of our lawyers : consequence of internatl. law not our wish. Agreed.

H.M. And a) ask specifically for extension of suspensory period b) suggest lawyers mtg.

R.S.C. Adjust a) for early publn. To show when initiative arose : tht. we got them over : tht. they persist in intention etc.

b) care not to encourage Argentines to ask for concessions after this has happened.

A. M’tain pressure for extendg. suspensory period. For consequences will be most inconvenient for us.

C.E. Consequences on H.O. alone wd. be terrific. Consequences in C. Service.

One of my own legal advisers is Eire man.

A.B. And let Irish public opinion know.

C.E. Cd. we even suggest lawyers conference before Act is repealed.

P.M. Keep Doms. in touch.

R.S.C. Only as matter of form. They can’t object.

P.M. Won’t bind them.

R.S.C. Want to get this into Sunday Press.

P.M. Will be said we are interfering in their Press with their Parlt.

Agreed. Deliver tonight. Let them (Dom. repves. in Paris) know in advance.

India.
