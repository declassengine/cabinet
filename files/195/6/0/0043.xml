C.M. 47(48). 5th July, 1948.

1. Berlin.

E.B. Sokolovski has sent an odd reply. Intentns not clear.

Diffy is with U.S. – desire to include repn to U.N. in the Note. To

ask U.N. to declare our ‘rights’ in Berlin: and we haven’t

any. Can’t budge them. But neither Fr. nor U.S. want repn

in C.F.M. That is awkward because we must be ready to

negotiate; and we can’t confirm negotn to Mil. Govrs. – can’t

make them plenipotentiaries. All I want to offer is to negotiate

(method not specified) thro’ Govts. if restns are w’drawn.

Fr. attitude curious: on settlement of W. Germany they pressed

for negotn with R: they now say tht. if they agree to negotiate

their Govt. will fall.

Had wanted Note to go in to-night. Strang Cttee now mtg.

If we can’t get agreemt., may have to decide to-day to send

in note from U.K. only.

Have tried a refce to Art. 33 of U.N. Charter. But doesn’t mean

anything. Refce as dispute wd. make a nonsense for all

4 Gt. Powers wd. be involved &amp; cd. neither vote nor veto!

Air lift is going well.

P.M. German Cttee shd. be ready for mtg. this p.m.

2. Palestine.

E.B. Haven’t seen offl. rept. of Bernadotte’s proposals.

Cab. will have to decide soon extent to wh. we support them.

Must tell Arabs to pay heed to them.

3. War Crimes: Trial of German Generals.

P.M. Go to para. 13. Don’t quibble over delay or no delay.

E.Sh. Began with disposn to put them on trial. Health &amp; diffies &amp; cost

repd to me: and apart fr. Runstedt we had no status because

offences mainly v. R. &amp; Poles who were reluctant to supply

evidence.

Medical evidence. Concln: all cd. stand trial, but mightn’t survive

a prolonged trial.

F.O. want all trials concluded by Sept. W.O. agree. But colln of

evce in these cases wd. prevent us from trying them before Sept.

W.O. conclude therefore no trial. Disposal: we suggest they be

returned to Germany &amp; left to be denazified there.

U.S. want 2 as witnesses in other trials. We recommend sending them

&amp; havg. them returned to U.K. before sending them to Germany.

Delays since Dec. can’t be attributed to W.O.

224

Att.Genl. Our good faith is involved. I.W. Cr. Commn submd names of 3

to us in 1945. Put it off ever since for one reason or another.

Leaves us in v. bad posn.

3 of them are quite fit to be tried. H.O. Board.

Not even suggd now that they shd. go to R. or Poles for trials.

What grounds cd. we adduce to U.N. for not procdg.

J. Public opinion tired of war trials. Opinion in U.K., when they see

3 old and sick men arraigned months after surrender, will be

perturbed.

Decn must, however, be taken on internatl grds.

In Dec. I decided on documents there was prima facie case.

But will take 6 months to get originals &amp; prepare the case.

And I doubt if we shall certainly be able to prove the case.

Real ques. is effect abroad.

Att.G. Shd. have no diffy in provg. orders were acted on: for we have

executed some people for carrying them out.

R.S.C. Irrelevant whr or no we shall get a convn.

E.B. Must press for trial.

Sept. 1st is a general objective. Needn’t exclude trial of these

important 3 individuals. Also was related to condns in

Germany &amp; establ. of C.A.

U.S. wd. have taken them over if we had acted quickly.

Have refused to hand over to R. or Poles.

On what grounds cd. I justify not putting them on trial.

Mustn’t give impn we were willing to surrender small men and

decline to surrender the big men.

H.D. Cd. we hand them over to R. or Poles?

E.B. Don’t want to re-open that. And v. diff. to do it at this moment.

P.M. U.S. have the evce: we must ask for it.

Bring them (the 3 fit men) to trial: in Germany. Agreed.

H.M. Shd. be some enquiry into W.O. delays.

Collect evce against all 4. Decide then about

Branchitz. fitness to stand trial. Agreed.

[Exit E.Sh.

Enter W.W.

4. Criminal Justice Bill: Death Penalty.

C.E. Instd to draw compromise clause acceptable to Party. This clause

satisfies all whom I have consulted, in confidence.

Haven’t bn. able to consult Silverman (abroad). But satisfies

225

Labour members on both abolitionist side and on the other.

1944-47. 51 executed. 28 cd. not have bn. sentenced under this

clause.

47 reprieved or B’moor. 40 cd. not have bn. sentenced

under clause.

(i.e. 95 – 30. redn in sentences pronounced.)

Suggd this clause wd. result in sterner view in cases sentenced.

But nothg. in statute can in fact affect H.O. advice on

prerogative.

Have tried to cover those murders wh. most stir public conscience.

Believe we cd. put Whips on w’out danger of revolt in Party.

Att.G. Illogical, but defensible as compromise. Safe to put Govt. Whips on.

R.S.C. V. satisfactory.

H.M. Best compromise – tho’ wd. have preferred status quo.

J. H/L. may throw this out.

C.E. Shd. like to see Archbishop of Cant. when this clause put down.

H.M. Man charged with one murder &amp; known to Police he is [Agreed.

prov. guilty of others. Wd he be covered if only one murder

included in indictmt.

C.E. cf. Health: indicted for 2 murders. Second case wasn’t gone on with

when convd on 1st.

Diffy. is not this. It is: when 2 or 3 people are killed at once is it one

murder? We now treat it as one. Shall have to instruct D. of P.P.

that where there is only one incident only 1 murder be charged

in indictment.

J. Train wrecker wdn’t be covered by (e). May be criticised for that.

C.E. No cases where it has happened.

H.M. That won’t get you away in debate.

Att.G. Most brutal murders are covered in a) – d).

A.W. Discrn in prosn to indict for separate murders.

P.M. Philosophy of e) is, not numbers, but disposition to go on murdering

time after time.

J. Consider also murder connd with kidnapping.

H.M. (c) of clause. Is “similar” right?

Att.Genl. Yes: intended. Otherwise it wd. extend to instruments!

226

J. May be argued tht. 2 issues be put to juries a) guilty of murder

b) guilty within this clause. Divided trial.

b) is a ques. for the jury: on the facts.

P.M. e) can’t be put to jury before verdict returned.

C.E. Tho’ public will know: and 2nd trial can’t be a fair one.

On e) 1st jury will find on 1st case. Different jury will try 2nd case.

If pr. admits the prev. conviction, the sentence can be

pronounced. If he doesn’t jury will have to try issue wtr. he

was convd before.

A.W. Believed we might have trouble in H/C. even tho’ Party agreed,

unless scope extended as it has now been. As now drafted

think we can carry it.

Agreed: subject to further consn by L.O.’s of

2 main points raised in discussion.

H.M. If H/L. did reject this clause, we wd. have to consider a) losing Bill

b) acceptg. H/L. decn c) enactg. our views under Parlt. Act.

Don’t like c).

P.M. Nor do I.

C.E. Deprecate trying to cross bridges before we reach them.

Situation may be different.

[Exit Att.Genl. &amp; W.W. P.M.: No decn (or talk) about that issue. [Enter J.S.

5. International Wheat Agreement.

J.S. As in memo.

R.S.C. No provn for conditional w’drawal. Wd. be regarded therefore as

ineffective &amp; we shd. remain full members. Art. 20(3) can

w’draw or not, only.

J.S. That wdn’t do.

J. I agree with R.S.C.

J.S. Shall we take L.O. opinion on that?

P.M. Yes.

If L.O. confirm R.S.C.’s view, we have no choice but to w’draw.

N.B. Need we mention prices (para. 7)? Dangerous to give up poss.

advantage.

227

J.S. Now propose only para. 4 of Amaze????. Doesn’t mention prices.

Agreed: we must withdraw, subject to L.O.’s clear

public statement that it is because U.S. haven’t ratified.

H.M. Effect on Can. prices. Cd. C.R.O. forestall any suggn we must

re-negotiate for higher price.

J.S. No occasion to re-open contracts concluded.

[Exit J.S. Enter J.G.

6. Civil Service Superannuation.

R.S.C. As in memo.

H.M. V. much better.

Not impressed by App. II. Thin list.

R.S.C. Only examples.

J.G. Satisfied.

G.T. Teachers. Some delay before actuarial examn completed.

This Bill will come in next year. Ques. of mil. service of

teachers will have to come again to L.P. Cttee.

A.V.A. Believe there will be some demand from Services.

7. Industrial Injuries: Supplementary Scheme for Miners.

P.M. Supplement for young childless widow reduced from 20/= to 5/=.

I authd this.

Approved. [Exit J.G.

8. E.R.P. Basis of Loan.

R.S.C. Talked Harriman &amp; Finletter. U.S. confusion.

They think 3% from grant: repaymt. after 1956 at terms = 28 year

loan. Flexible on amortisation: &amp; let out on paymt./interest.

Diffy. 1 b. (of 5) must be by loan, under Act. E.C.A. intends

to give fixed %age of loan to grant for each country. That wd. have effect of reducg. our grant unless we took all loan.

That = impossible. But they want to lend all the 1 b. in 1st year, to get 2nd yr. ?????

Think therefore we must take full $100 m. in 1st year, tho’ 75 m. only

cd. be taken in capital goods.

Agreed.

228

9. Sympathy to C.E. over his wife’s death. 229
