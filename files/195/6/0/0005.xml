creation of 2nd Chamber to protect (by suspensory veto) Lander Govts:

Executive Cttee: power to legislate for bi-zonal Supreme Ct. will be enacted by mil. Ordinance.

French not in discns: told this = temporary: Fr. re-action, wh. we feared, not so severe – than accepted draft statement.

H.M. Cd. not Fr. be brought in earlier in future?

H.McN. Aim at Tri-partite machinery.

Agreed.

2. Cyrenaica

E.Sh. Cleared with F.O. &amp;. C.O.

No concrete proposals – want only approved in principle.

By Aug. 8.000 – thereafter 20.000 B. troops in C. from Palestine.

P.M. Progress since April?

E.Sh. Marking time rather because uncertainty of position.

C.J. Will co-operate &amp; second staff.

Later on, shall have to decide Dpl. responsibility. I prefer F.O.

H.M. Importance of getting a foot in here. Will be tricky. Wd it be wise to have W.O., C.O., F.O., &amp; ? C.E.F.S. working party to get somethg. done which we are there. Sudan model.

Need for constructive policy.

Shd. Ministers take a hand?

A.V.A. More done than appears. Emir is friendly.

Endorse importance.

E.Sh. Accommodn for troops – will involve materials.

Principles approved.

Working Party to be appointed – E.Sh., C.J. &amp; H.McN. to

29

[Exit E.Sh.

[Enter J.S.

4. Production of Ground Nuts in E. Africa.

J.S. As in memo.

Special points. e.g. capital equipmt. mainly non-dollar from now on.

Scheme has fired public imagination.

P.M. Coming year: can you concentrate on areas producg. quickest results?

J.S. As far as poss. But most promising area can’t be opened until Apl. because depends on expanding port facilities.

P.M. Effect on agric. machinery industry?

T.W. 1) First assumed big consumptn of fertilisers. No repve to this in W. Paper. But supplies cdn’t be sent from U.K. This shd. be covered in W. Paper – to disarm criticism: for risk of competn with U.K. agriculture.

2) Machinery. U.K. can produce requiremts. only if factory extensions made (Massey-Harris). Corpn assume prodn by 1950.

J.S. On 1) estimates in earlier Paper stand. Procuring was planned with Agric. Dpts. Shd. be manageable partly fr. U.K. &amp; partly fr. African sources.

On 2) agricult. machinery contract with M-Harris. Covers to 1950. Thereafter want prodn by M-Harris in U.K. &amp; consultg. B/T re new factory.

C.J. Fertilisers potentially available from Uganda. Considering exploitn with I.C.I.

J.S. Agreed to repeat fertiliser point from earlier Paper.

H.M. Cd. we open W. Africa too &amp; increase supply – to get price down.

W. Paper. Propose Press Conference – with some photos. to show what’s going on. C.J. might attend.

30

A. And a good map, wh. shd. be circulated to Cab. if not included in W. Paper.

Para. 4 of memo. Are the C.O.S. going to fade out?

J.S. When they have completed their specific jobs.

United Africa Co. will, however, hand over to Food Corpn, who will take on the technical &amp; other staffs.

T.W. Para. 3 of W. Paper. Drafting changes to make it clear we knew from outset machines wdn’t be available fr. U.K.

R.S.C. a) M/F shdn’t assume dollars for machinery for 2 years. Shd. try therefore to get prodn in U.K. as early as possible.

b) This shd. be covered in Col. Developmt. W. Party.

c) Satisfied with local financial control?

J.S. On c) now in hands of Co. We have supervisors, who aren’t however in control. Agency aren’t perfect: look for improvemt. Will discuss with Ty.

C.J. Draft. a) recognise co-opn of local Govt.

b) thanks for work of managing Agents. I.C.I. much impressed with it.

H.M. Debate shd. be avoided – Supply Day or on Bill.

Approved subject to points noted.

[Exit J.S. &amp; H.Mc.N

[Enter L.S. &amp; C.K.

5. National War Memorial

P.M. No enthusiasm – save from R.S.C.

L.S. Agree no evce of enthusiasm. But wd. one expect it before some proposal made. My diffy. has been to think of anything wh. wd. arouse genl. support. Best prs. = Westminster Precincts.

P.M. Is this a good moment to start?

R.S.C. Only to secure site. Raising the money wd. then be deflationary.

I prefer developmt. of St. Pauls (devastated) site.

J. Agree fr. aesthetic angle.

A.B. Resist proposal. Shd. discourage it.

a)Wd. excite demands for local memorials. Horrors.

If, however, merely open space – don’t object to that.

Still fear a) however.

31

T.W. Support A.B. – unless we cd. so arrange it as to prevent spread of local memorials.

H.W. Cenotaph action shd. have given a local lead.

If open space adopted as national memorial, that also wd. be useful local lead.

H.M. a) local horrors. b) Will Provinces subscribe to London memorial.

c) risk we won’t raise enough money.

St. Pauls project anyhow wd. be rashly expensive.

This is really a shamming proposn. City shd. do a good planning job on St. Paul’s site anyhow.

Public subscripn unlikely to raise ¼ of cost.

The project has bn. mooted (deputns, H/L debate etc.) and has not excited public support. Don’t believe there is any steam behind this.

Conclude therefore – leave it alone.

P.M. St. Pauls’ scheme wd. appear to Provinces to be aid for City of London to do its planning job.

A.B. Once moot this &amp; it will provoke the monumental masons!

G.A.I. Met. Boros. wd. resent public subscriptn for open space in City.

C.E. Appropte action was to add date to Cenotaph &amp; leave it at that.

Don’t want separate memorials for 2 wars. Public believe sacrifices made were in same cause.

P.M. Share general view. Open spaces = policy in planning. Why subscribe for one &amp; not others. Fear people wd. say – let city provide that open space= &amp; let Memorial be built in addn there or elsewhere.

C.K. No representns made to us.

Will provoke local moves.

Not likely to get subscriptions.

R.S.C. City won’t in fact do it, as planning matter. Much too expensive.

L.S. And I have no power to impose costly plan.

A. H/L. debate fell v. flat.

Only danger of Govt. inaction = pressure by Chatfield etc. for particular projects.

G.T. Pressure in from only 4 individuals.

Agreed. No action.

[Exit: L.S. &amp; C.K.

[Enter W.W.

6. Electoral Reform Bill.

C.E. Scheme based on mathematics was rejected because anomalies produced.

This scheme is based on community of interest. Best we are likely to get. So long as we aim at a H/C. of around 615.

We shall have 8 or 9 seats in hand: shall have 609 const. Margin therefore to meet strong feelings.

I believe B’fd. has had worse deal than these large boros.

3 of these large boros. are in Ldn. wh. on nos. is entitled to less repn than it had before. To bring Ldn. up to 43 wd. be contrary move.

Future alterations in popn can be met by later proposals of Boundary Commns.

Let us start with Commns proposals. If v. strong opposn in Cttee we can consider. But best ground to stand on is Commns Rpt.

P.M. Don’t like basis of Commns Rpt.

H.M. Choice = shd. Bill be altered now or shd. we wait &amp; see what pressure we get in Parlt.

Wd. rather not submit to H/C. pressure. Thus, if Cab. are clear, alter Bill now.

Commns have taken 90.000 as dividing line.

Univ. Members are to go: gives some room for manoeuvre.

Will be controversial Bill. Want to reduce that to minimum.

B’fd: Hull: N’Castle. N. 228.794. 4 seats (53 –59.000)

Hull = 219.293. 4 seats. B’fd. 213.399. 3 seats, averaging 60,000 &amp; more.

P.M. If it’s not being done on mathe. basis, must take a/c history.

H.M. Reading. Gateshead. E. Ham. Blackburn.

No sacred reason why you shd. have more County members than Boro. members.

Believe we shall have to give way over this.

Shd. we do it first or later?

Balance in favour of changing now. Give 2 members to the 8 Boros. &amp; stand firm on that.

A.B. Have opposed this re-distribn from outset. Believe L. Govt. boundary revision shd. have come first.

Diffy. of deviating from Rpt. is tht. Govt. then must justify all other recommns of Rpt.

Labour Party likely to fight for retention of status quo.

“Party” result of Commns work – v. much against Labour.

Whr. intended or not. Our strength is largely urban.

“Community of interest” principle has removed industrial fringe from rural into industrial constituencies.

Postpone Bill – to await l. govt. boundaries.

If you go on, Bill shd. incorporate Commns Rpt. w’out change.

33

R.S.C. Diffy. of Govt. changing recommns. Gets into Party angle.

Let criticisms rest v. Commns not Govt.

A.V.A. Agreed with R.S.C.

Further point: don’t upset those who have accepted.

Rpt. e.g. Sheffield, by giving new concessions to e.g. Reading.

W.W. If you make any change in Bill as introduced, you must be resolved to stick to that.

Diffy if any changes are accepted in Cttee.

P.M. Tactically, much stronger to take Commns Rpt.

W.W. And, as Commns now permanent, there are continuing opportunities for revision.

Agree: Put Commns Rpt. into Bill.

H.M. Not convinced &amp; want to be recorded. }

Can’t defend 8 Boros: want to give way now }

}

P.M. But don’t resolutely set your face. re considering any change. }

7. Parliament Bill: House of Lords Reform.

A. As in memo

A.B. Doesn’t 2nd Para. go too far. Assumes reformed H/L. shd. have no greater powers.

P.M. Omit words marked.

Agreed.

H.M. Must make it clear tht. Bill must be passed this Session.

A. Believe Salisbury will move adjournment of 2nd Rdg. until he knows what amendments he can get – and also to avoid rejecting Bill.

Is “this Session” essential?

H.M. Yes.

After further discussion –

Agreed: formula as at A. in memo.

34

8. Civil Aviation: Ordering of Aircraft.

H.M. As in memo.

R.S.C. One good man vice Cttee.

P.M. Shdn’t be announced to House.

Shd. be a report to Cab. not for publn.

H.M. Wd. prefer 3 men. 1 alone is v. risky. And nearly all people have, or get, a bias.

What can be said in Parlt?

R.S.C. “Is being examined”.

G.S. a) organisn to remain as it is. Pro tem?

H.M. Yes.

G.S. b) persons (1 or 3) shd. be sympathetic to natn.

N. Formula: Govt. will call into consultn men with bus. experience to assist them in reviewing m/g. issues.

P.M. &amp; L.P. to settle.
