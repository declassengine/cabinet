C.M. 6 (48) 22nd January, 1948

1. National Health Service: Discussions with Doctors

A.B. Negotns dominated by small no. of vocal people, whose views are not shared by responsible but inarticulate members of the profession.

Believe profession has had all reasonable concessions – even to edge of jeopardising the Act &amp; our finances – and must now be resisted.

Appeal to courts – wd. in fact damage profession. Wd. like to concede it, on that ground, if it weren’t so objectionable constitutionally.

Protn for doctors is v. lavish: Tribunal added since Willink’s scheme discussed.

Basic salary. Labour Party wd. like to see it larger. Spears Rpt. made small basic salary = higher capitn inevitable.

Sale &amp; purchase of practices: no ground for concession.

Doctors can’t be allowed to defy Parlt. Wd. undermine discipline.

Plebiscite will go heavily v. scheme: but believe they will then come in.

A. Support A.B. generally.

Must look for concessions wh. wd. weaken B.M.A. with weaker men.

Salary &amp; fee – Ty. v. generous.

Two points, however,

a) must we find £66m to stop sale of practices.

Is that essential to scheme?

b) appeal. Need for publicity to counter impn tht. Minister can remove a man arbitrarily. Fact &amp; constitn of Tribunal, local hearing, central Trib. – all need hammering in to average g.p.

Organisation needed to get hold of younger men.

Beware of Med. Pract. Union – some of worst elements in profession – don’t let them get assocd with Ministers propaganda.

P.M. No appeal from G.M.C.?

A.B. No.

A.W. But they are proposing legn to provide one.

A.B. Doctors don’t read my document apparently – gives reply on b)

My fear is whr. public are adequately protected v the doctor.

Concurrent power of G.M.C. remain.

No doctor may be removed unless his employing Executives (1/2 drs.) move v. him. Then 3 enquiries before it comes to Minister.

A. Understand all this – my point is it shd. be rammed home to the g.p. They don’t know.

T.W. Supported this. What can be done before plebiscite?

36

E.B. Cd. T.U.C. and Socies representg. patient post a statement to every g.p.

Is there time to organise this before plebiscite?

From local Trades Council to local doctor.

At least, before July we shd. get outside body to make an objection statement.

On a) we can’t have a vested right in a State list of patients.

Ministers etc., shd. be briefed continuously with facts to be made in speeches.

A.B. Agree. Much of this laid on.

B’cast. Film. Getting T.U.’s on to it. Press turning in our favour.

Volume of organised propaganda is coming along.

Will consult with H.M. on this.

P.M. General concln. No concession at present. Will suggest Minister is on the run. But do our best to put it over, with public.

Agreed: announce 5/7 as date of operation.

[Exit A.B.

2. Iraq.

E.B. Telephone to Bagdad.

Outbreaks there – Treaty made the pretext for that. They haven’t in fact had time to consider it.

Basic cause = Palestine.

Request sent for leaders to discuss handling of disorders - &amp; took chance of doing absent P.M. down over the Treaty.

Situation fr. our angle is O.K. For if they reject the other Treaty stands – 8 years to go.

3. Parliament.

H.M. Business for next week.

H.M. Economic Informn to M.O.’s.

R.S.C. won’t agree to Bulletin going to them. He agrees however tht. whips shd. tell M.P.’s tht. if they ask, they can be put on mailing list for hand-outs to Press Conferences on economic affairs. Mainly R.S.C.’s conferences. Start with that and extend, as desired, to conferences by other Ministers.

Agreed.

[Enter H. and J.G.

4. Scotland: Devolution.

A.W. Consultns all round – general acquiescence by Party groups.

37

Will consult Labour Party as a whole this evening.

Genl. agreement extends to not having an enquiry.

W. Paper = Appendix A will not be published: will go on to Order Paper.

H.M. Verbal points on W. Paper – wh. I will settle with A.W.

Procedure on “2nd Rdg” in Grand Cttee. Any motion? Might embarrass us on Floor.

A.W. No motion. Done ‘??? ???’.

H.M. Para. 5 = 3 types of Bill. Modify this to make it clear tht. this won’t facilitate flood of Sc. legisln because all have to come back on to floor.

Someone shd. see Scottish Peers.

A.W. That is in hand.

P.M. Repercussions on Wales?

H.M. A.B. doesn’t like it fr. that angle. There will be a come back.

H. Feeling in Wales – nationalists aren’t strong in nos. but vocal in student circles and movemt. is makg. progress in industrial circles.

This will provoke some demands from Wales.

Agree can’t copy the legislative procedure because Wales has no separate legn. They will demand somethg.

Econ. Conference. We cd. hammer out somethg. comparable.

H. Nationalist movement in schools &amp; universities because based on language &amp; culture.

P.M. We cd. look at somethg. on side of Economics – tho’ not in legn.

C.E. Will be pressure for separate legn for Wales on education.

Every B/E. inspr. in Wales is ardent Nationalist.

J.G. That is fault of earlier Govts. – who tried to stifle nationalist feelings. Specially by preventg. teaching of Welsh in schools.

In 20 yrs. we lost 1/5th popn by Govt. policy. Not surprising we get this re-action.

Worried (on Party grounds) over Nationalism in W. Universities.

May be demand for more time to discuss W. affairs in Parlt.

Will be demand for Welsh Confce (going beyond Econ. affairs) wh. can represent Welsh views to Govt. In view of 1st para. of this Paper we can’t well reject it.

Shd. be some initiative by Govt. indicatg. recognise this feeling in Wales too.

H.M. Must welcome this demand when it comes, and see what we can do.

38

P.M. Omit last sentence of 1st para.

Trouble with Wales = they can’t put fwd. anything pratical.

A.W. Our “Conference” is not public.

Memo approved.

[Exit H., J.G., &amp; W.W.

[Enter B., H.G. G.S.

5. Economic Affairs.

R.S.C. B/Payments.

V. heavy drawings by India. £150m vice £60m agreed. Takg. this up with India. May mean India/Pakistan will have to have sterling area.

French Francs.

Reported results of discussion at I.M.F.

A. Scrap?

R.S.C. Going better.

G.S. Putting in memo. to Cabinet.

Steel industry likely to be O.K. on this for 6 mos.

Deadlock still in Germany - hope U.S. pressure may break it.

E.B. Political talks re Germany will begin v. soon. M/S might watch their interests. Will see they get the pp. U.S. inclined to give too much to Germans.

H.M. Para. 3. Textile emplt. Can’t we get a drive?

Cotton price goods only 25% over 1944. Labour = bottleneck.

R.S.C. Prodn Cttee has considered &amp; I am reportg. to Cabinet.

H.M. No point in pushing exports to soft countries just to raise figure.

Table 2. Cotton showg. increase in last few months. Present rate is enough pro tem.

H.M. Paras. 5-8. Is this good moment to open discns over extendg. hours/agreemt.

H.G. Wrote N.C.B. as approved by E.P.C. Haven’t had his reply yet.

H.M. Para. 14. Misleading? Para. 2 of Bulletin shows drop in percentage of exports.

R.S.C. Volume rose, but percentage dropped.

H.W. Nothg. can be done to divert exports ordered long since.

39

H.M. Are B/T. doing enough on diversion - &amp; are industries responding?

Tractors are doing well.

T.W. Pinch of salt about Fergusons’. His income is fortuitous.

H.W. Industry is co-operative over diversion.

E.B. Is it solid enough? E.g. in U.S. it’s trade mark that lasts not article.

R.S.C. V. expensive because dollars advertising needed to put a mark across.

E.B. Not sure. E.g. if worsted were called Brad-cloth it wd. advertise itself.

A.W. Braemar do it. cf. Whisky too.

R.S.C. Done on manufacturers name. Big reputn with U.S. tailors.

H.W. Will send E.B. recent reports on B. trade in U.S.

E.B. Cars: believe U.S. will have to go in for smaller cars to save petrol. We shd. boost our cars as B. contribn to World need to save petrol. U.S. are frightened of that. Play on those fears.

H.W. Results coming fr. efforts to get B. business men out to West instead of N. York only.

E.B. W. of Rockies = B. Dom. for trade. Warehousing on W. Coast.

A.V.A. Steel allocations. Cut on ship bldg. &amp; repairs.

R.S.C. They exceeded allocn last year by 200.000 t. They have bn. cut by reference to what they used last year.

A.V.A. Not cut on repairs.

R.S.C. Admy. can see to that.

H.M. Para. 15. U.S. farm prices have risen over 4%. Emphasises need to stimulate prodn and exports fr. other countries.

Our b/paymts. have improved, while rest of area has gone worse.

R.S.C. That = India, as I have said.

C.E. B/Payments. We never hear anything has gone favourably.

Grave misgivings – does country realise tht. every change is for the worse.

R.S.C. Factors outside complete U.K. control. This = price of being at centre of sterling area, wh. brings us other gt. benefits.

C.E. Another shock coming to U.K. public? 40

R.S.C. Yes: on new b/paymts. memo. coming to Cabinet.

E.B. Are we gaining on balance by sterling area basis?

P.M. This point shd. be covered in R.S.C.’s new memo.
