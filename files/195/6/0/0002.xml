C.M. 2(48). 8th January, 1948.

1. The Antarctic.

E.B. Don’t like a) or b).

R.S.C. Can’t we refer to Internatl Court?

E.B. Yes: press them harder on this. On this island, we have a good case.

C.N.S. 28 days to get a cruiser there: must have early notice if we do b) or c).

R.S.C. More vigorous pressure. Argentine Amb. here is a lawyer.

A.V.A. Strategic interest., esp. if Panama situation changes.

This = 1st real approach to B. dependency in naval strength.

Must consider effect on other claims to our Colonial possns.

P.M. Good claim: real interest. Must be satisf. on both points.

G.W. Consult N.Z. &amp; Austr. because they have rockier claims than ours

in this area.

Agreed { E.B. to go into more vigorously

{ C.R.O. to warn N.Z. &amp; Australia.

{ Govr. to keep away pro tem.

[Exit Hall, C.N.S., J.S.

2. Tourist Travel.

R.S.C. Wise to relax before summer.

Diff. ease = Switzerland. Must try to divert people e.g. to France.

C.E. Link up with mid-wk. sport. For this f. travel is regarded as a

class matter.

R.S.C. But much W.T.A. in this.

C.E. Merits apart, this = political cry.

A.B. Unfortunate public consequences if this announced w’out anything

re petrol. Latter v. unfair to honest citizen = adminn can’t be

defended. If you can’t do petrol, don’t do this.

A.W. Supported A.B.

P.M. Look at the two together.

R.S.C. But no chance of relaxing petrol.

11

A.B. Then we can’t relax foreign travel. These are related in public

mind, even tho’ not in fact.

P.M. P’pone for a week (Tues. next) and consider petrol/travel together.

Memo. from H.G.

[Enter Pakenham

3. Germany.

E.B. Have bn. striving for really democratic Germany.

Dangers of Police State. Spreading now to Czechoslovakia. Reign

of terror. If that is allowed to extend to Rhine, it will spread to

Gib. Must be stopped.

Shan’t close door to united Germany – that wd. provoke irredentist

movemt. fr. R. side. But can’t go on w’out giving more real

responsibility to Germans.

Must develop trade with East Germany &amp; satellite countries – from W.

Zones.

At Potsdam we were confronted with U.S. scheme on reparations. At

Yalta understanding (U.S./R.) that reparations wd. be a) capital

b) current prodn. Tho’ W.S.C. reserved our position, R. claim

agreemt. reached. At Potsdam U.S. sought to settle repns: &amp; we

accepted 15% exchangeable and 10% free. I always regarded

that as distinct fr. all other Potsd. decns because other Allies

participate in reparns. If R. takes her %age &amp; we deliver only to

other Allies, we are takg. unjustified unilateral action. Suggd

to be tht. delaying deliveries to R. will put pressure on them.

But I don’t believe it will affect them in fact. The amount is so

small tht. it’s not an issue we ought to fight R. on. Also, if you

deliver to W. &amp; not to R., you open R. claim to repns from current

prodn. Want therefore to resist being dragged into row on this

issue by U.S.

Dismemberment. Suggd by Stalin, but U.K. never accepted it. And

at Potsdam R. switched over to centralisation. We have stood

for Federal arrangemt., with some central authority but large

powers to Läuder.

Bringing other countries in – C.

General consensus of opinion in favour of Federal Europe. Ques. is

who shall control it? Our course shd. be – let it evolve, &amp; prs.

seek via media betwn. R. Communism &amp; U.S. capitalism.

This is my general approach to Germany – Pro-European.

A.B. Favour these proposals on Germany.

But needn’t be an anti-Soviet policy.

H.W. Think we cd. begin to be tougher in our econ. bargaining with

R. Zone. Large quantities of steel (going thro’ to R. itself)

wh. we cd. bargain for more wheat.

C.P.(48) 5 – approved.

12

4. Austria.

E.B. Importce of clearing this – a) to disentangle from Germany.

b) to get our troops out.

If we can cut down R. extra-territorial operation of plant &amp; R. claims

to G. assets. I hope w. Powers will make some sacrifice to

assist Austrian economy. Unhappy about our oil claims – doubt

if companies did exploit Austrian resources as much pre-Hitler as

post.

H.M. What line shall we take over R. claims?

E.B. Three aims a) look after Carinthia, so Yugoslavs don’t pinch it.

b) develop industry in w. Zones of Austria.

Really in the air until we know what R. attitude will be.

C.E. Can it ever be viable?

E.B. Yes – if they had control of resources in R. Zone.

A.B. And on organisation.

C.P.(48) 9 – approved.

5. Foreign Policy.

E.B. Didn’t expect Marshall Offer wd. precipitate this so violently.

But R. decided it was “now or never” &amp; must bring it all

to a head. R. decided to try to smash w. Europ. countries

(economically) before a w. union cd. be brought into

effective existence.

French expect next upheaval in Feb.

Considered too wtr. strikes in U.K. cd. be provoked Mar./Apl.

W. world was awake to it &amp; prevented it.

How long can we afford not to have w. Europe organised.

P.M. Must now have a positive policy. Not enough merely to denounce R.

But can’t close eyes to what R. is doing – appeasement. That

leads to E.B.’s concln.

A.B. Emphasis in pp. makes me uneasy.

“Mustn’t become handmaid of U.S. policy.” But in practice, it means

an anti-Sov. policy. For our middle policy doesn’t come out

clearly. We are always in anti-Sov. posn. For our policies

always commend themselves to Tory newspp. That makes me

unhappy.

We say 3rd Force: but what we do is anti-Soviet with Right

support. E.g. Greece. A Socialist policy wd. have strengthened

Gk. centre. But in fact we have supported a Gk. Govt. wh. is v.

re-actionary. cf. also references in memo. to Spain &amp; Portugal.

13

This picture of world sitn is accurate to-day. But it won’t last.

The cultural watersheds of satellite States flow West. And R. can’t

make them turn eastwds. Trade can make for intercourse there

wh. will enable us to penetrate the curtain.

R. offensive now because they are weak &amp; frightened (by U.S.

Press etc.). And no wonder. No reason to fear war fr. Russia –

agrarian masses can’t pack a punch.

Our course = avoid immutable decns. Pursue active social policies in

Europe in such a way tht. we are criticised by the extreme Right.

Matter of emphasis.

P.M. Real Left will get capitalist support on e.g. civil liberties.

We mustn’t be frightened when Tories applaud our liberal

views.

E.B. Greece. Is strategic area. R.’s imperialist aims in Greece. We

resisted that drive down to Med.

We tried to strengthen Gk. centre: but they won’t stand up.

And Gks. voted for Royalists for sake of security, law &amp; order.

Tie-up with U.S.A. Inevitable because we cdn’t carry the cost any

longer.

“R. doesn’t want war.” True: but she will be as provocative as

possible.

H.M. Sympathise with A.B.’s fear of support from Right. Don’t care for

having to attack Russia. But how can we help it on the facts.

Any discn on f. affairs = ⅔rds on the mischief-making activities

of Sov. Union &amp; their imitation of Hitler’s tactics. And the

success of those tactics.

And R. propaganda continues – thro’ local Communists and fellow

travellers. Which is more dangerous than R. radio.

We are therefore bound to include some criticisms of R. system &amp;

activities &amp; aims. To weaken their influence.

But one doesn’t do this with pleasure. And doesn’t like the Tory

applause wh. it brings.

We mustn’t however be driven into too much anti-R. publicity.

And the more positive element we can introduce, the better.

Welcome w. Union idea. Trouble will be: Doms. &amp; Col. Empire.

Need for closer inter-dep. orgn to work on f. policy issues which

involve economic ques. (F.O., Planners, B/T. etc.)

Can we carry cost of any part. f. policy?

Much to be done on detail of a positive policy. Shd. be

interdepl discn of that, too.

E.B. Not going to make these pp. public.

No intentn of making anti-R. attacks in my speeches.

My duty is to develop positive side.

Believe I’ve done this in last 2 years. Constructive work which F.O.

have done all over world in last 2 years.

14

Trade negotns etc., have shown U.K. is still most constructive

leader in world.

Positive action in welcomg. Marshall Plan, and organising Europe

to receive Aid.

Now there is a chance of a w. Union – informal, with no written

constitn.

R.S.C. H’to have opposed idea of w. Union – in hope of understandg. with R.

Convinced now we are driven to it, as prime necessity for our

econ. survival: together with Africa.

That is least that will balance with R. and U.S.

Share A.B.’s dislike of Tory support. Expln prob. is that Tories here

are Liberals – no extreme Right people of the kind who are

willing to associate with Left to extinguish Centre.

W. Union must be on a Socialist basis. Wd. therefore prefer to leave

Spain and Portugal out pro tem.

Shd. therefore work out precise steps. Around what are you going to

organise this? Defence: economic system? V. diff. to organise

round a sentiment. Problem will be to find a point of focus

? Socialist principles.

Start prs. with France, with her “Third Force” Govt.

Emphasise socialist content of this f. policy.

E.B. Portugal. Can’t ignore her, if you want Africa in this sphere.

Despite her unwelcome political system.

Spain, of course, is another story – until we can get Franco out.

C.J. Can’t ignore Portugal if anythg. is to be done in organising Africa.

Have opened discns with them in Ldn. They are anxious to pursue

this. Useful results can be secured cf. in outlets for

Rhodesia etc.

P.M. How will you build this up? Not by constitution. Not by Socialist

propaganda alone. Cultural links – f. travel important there.

Needs action on v. broad lines.

H.M. Can some organn like Marshall Cttee in Paris work this out – with

C.O. &amp; C.R.O. added?

E.B. Move already to keep the 16 countries together.

My aim since ’45 has bn. to save outer crust of Europe.

Effect of R. refusal of M. Aid has bn. to keep together

the ring of S/Democratic countries.

Dependence on U.S. I have tried to keep clear of it. As soon as we

can afford to develop Africa, we can cut loose from U.S.

My aim has bn. to develop B. influence in the heart of the world –

thro’ Med. &amp; M/East to India, and thro’ Africa to S.E.A.

Disengaging somewhat from S. America. Thus leaving U.S.

and R. to clash on the fringe i.e. in F/East and on n. frontiers

of Canada.

15

A.B. We always assumed tht. R. wd. meet her sociological frontiers when

she came up v. developed material civilisations.

That’s all right. But represent it, not as anti-Soviet policy, but

as natural defence of w. Europe.

T.W. Civil liberties – freedoms etc., etc.

Support E.B. and A.B. too.

E.B. must say somethg. in F. Affairs Debate about U.K. attitude to

Soviet policy.

J. How &amp; around what are you to build w. Union?

Defence: economic: cultural: Or all three?

E.B. Begun with Anglo-French Cttee. Economic.

Next: technical developmt. of Africa. Must be quiet about that

because don’t want to bring U.S. in.

Next: cultural. Means re-organising B.B.C. Want it linked into a

w. European system. As at Singapore – one informn service for

S.E.A.

Will a 2nd language (compulsory in schools) be necessary in U.K. ?

To facilitate a w. Union.

P.M. Can you get a single Radio in Luxembourg? For W. Union.

Cd. P. Gordon-Walker look into this?

E.B. Possibly by developing central Radio in W. Zones of Germany.

Defence. R. has now 300 m. In w. Europe, w’out Germany prs. only

150 m. but with Africa added we cd. be larger than either R. or

U.S.

R.S.C. Seeking better econ. balance in world – seek grouping of R., U.S.,

W. Europe and Asia (later). That wd. be sensible &amp;

non-provocative.

P.M. Let E.B. circulate his speech to T.U.C. in 1932.

P. Encourage G. leaders to hope G. will soon be included.

They are excluded pro tem. for reasons diff. from those for

excldg. Spain.

Let them come to mtgs. Encourage them to think a chair will be kept

for them at the Table.

G.T. Effect on U.K.

Diffies due to encouraging idea only black or white.

Tory support for any attack on Soviet.

Not a ques. of pro-Soviet or con.

Need to emphasise line taken by P.M. in recent b’cast viz., trouble due to R. refusal of our offer to work with them.

Categorical denials backed up by proof.

16

A.V.A. In short, tell the truth about Russia.

A.W. R. has herself destroyed all the influence she had with working in

U.K. Let her continue to take the blame for refusing to

co-operate with world.

C.J. Colonial Empire &amp; Propaganda.

Have overhauled informn services. Tried to interest B. newspp. in

Col. work. Strengthened T.U. movement. Have used film &amp;

B. Council work.

Cultivated students in Ldn., who will be future leaders in Colonies.

Linked them e.g. with W.E.A.

News-service to African Press.

All this is positive work with anti-Communist effects.

P.M. Congress of Europe – proposed to be called at Hague.

E.B. Am consultg. Morgan Phillips &amp; Healey.

Diffy about W.F.T.U. Means T.U.C. shdn’t go to this.

No diffy, however, in Labour Party being represented.

………later, discovered E.B. was talkg. of somethg. different.

And knew nothing of it.

P.M. Gave further particulars. Linked with W.S.C.’s European

organisation.

R.S.C. Otherwise a good lot of people.

P.M. L/N. Union sort of idea. What is to be our line?

A.B. Assocn with this will put us wrong.

E.B. I won’t touch it – because I wasn’t consulted!

P.M. Ques. really is – attitude of Labour Party. Will E.B. consider and

advise.

E.B. V. well.

A. Remember Dom. interest. N.Z. &amp; Australia will favour this.

Take care to see tht. C.R.O. are consulted.
