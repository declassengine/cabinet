C.M. 17(48). 26th February, 1948.

1. Parliament. [Enter W.W.

H.M. Business for next week.

2. House of Commons: Members’ Pensions Fund.

R.S.C. Altho’ not increase in salary – there have bn. ques. about reducg.

salaries because economic crisis. Is it wiser therefore to

p’pone Bill until later in Session – Anyhow until after

Budget. May be misrepresented.

W.W. Sometime this Session.

Agreed: p’pone until after Budget.

3. Local Government Bill.

A.B. L.a. has bn. able to do what it liked with own money. But now

there is State money in all l.a. acts. Raises ques. of H/L. powers.

H.M. Ty. is in effect ratepayer. Must pay proportion of rates, whatever l.a.

chooses to do.

E.B. Won’t be under control until central assessment comes in.

A.B. Power in Bill to control l.a. wh. goes made over money.

4. Political Activities of Members of Boards. [Enter H.G. B. N. and G.S.

H.M. Difficult.

Para. 4(a). Can’t part-timers be free of this? L.a. members on

Reg. Bds. for gas &amp; electricity.

H.G. Bound by Act to appoint people with l.a. experience. Taking over l.a.

undertaking. Have therefore apptd a no. of men active in l.a.

politics.

Either exclude part-timers from 4(a). Or interpret it narrowly.

Or dispensn for l.a. repn on gas &amp; electicity Bds.

P.M. Undesirable tht. men in State pay shd. run political machine.

Read a) and b) together.

E.B. Too restrictive. Will ruin Unions. The part-time members are not

salaried.

89

B. Latham &amp; Clay (Chairman &amp; Treasurer of [Exit C.E. and H.G.

Ldn. Labour Party) are full time members of my Executive.

And my view was they wd. have to resign those political offices.

Part-time Reg. members – I have sought men with l.a. experience.

P.M. That’s O.K. under 4(b).

4(a) is directed v. officers of Party machine.

A.B. 4(a) is right because Minister who removes such a man because

unsuitable for the Bd. may then be attacked in Party machine.

A. Diffies in H/L. Latham, Trefgarne, Leman, Dukeston, Simon – are

they to be excluded from H/L. debates?

P.M. No. 4(c) can be interpreted widely.

But Latham, as full-time, shd. not continue as Chairman of Ldn.

Labour Party.

H.M. May be right on full-time. But part-time: why shdn’t they do 4(a).

Don’t press full-timer.

N. What is meant by “active connection”? Executive of Ldn. Labour

Party – can a member be that &amp; part-time? Think unpaid

officers of Party cd. be part-time members.

H.M. Some T.U.’s are removing part-time members from Union work.

P.M. That is covered by 4(d).

E.B. Part-time members of P.L.A.?

P.M. My distinction is between membership of l.a. etc., and active

connection with Party machine. I’m quite clear that they

shdn’t be even part-time members of Bds.

E.B. Suppose a T.U. Secretary were elected Treasurer of Ldn. Labour

Party. Then he is precluded from sitting on Boards.

A.B. Why not? Improper that it shd. appear that Labour Ministers shd.

be able to confer patronage on men in pol. machine.

R.S.C. Shd. a Party Govt. appoint a Party official to any job? No.

G.T. Must our impartiality affect our efficiency?

Unless men administering believe in policy it won’t succeed.

No success in direct labour scheme achieved until Socialist

official appointed to run it.

Agreed: whole-time members shd. not be actively connd

with Party machine.

Para. 4(d) omit “past” before “associations”.

90

Agreed. Para. 4(a) “shd. not remain an officer of any

x/ political Party” vice active assocn and apply

it to part-time also.

J. Rule of conduct. Not a matter for courts. [Exit W.W.

A. In practice no diffy. so far in conforming with this kind of principle.

P.M. Don’t intend to publish these Rules, in Parlt. This is for guidance

of Ministers.

A. x/ is wider still. Wd. cover Chairman of a local Labour Party.

R.S.C. It should.

A.W. Acceptance of posn on a Bd. will limit efficiency of Party official.

G.A.I. Where do you draw the line on officials. Right down to local

Parties?

A.B. Yes. That’s where the bitterness is.

E.B. Why not leave this to discretion of Ministers?

R.S.C. This discussion itself has shown there is a diffce of opinion between

Ministers. Must have a common line.

J. What is diffce betwn. part-time &amp; full-time?

H.M. One gets whole income from his Bd. Other is rendering only

part-time public service.

E.B. Govr. has taken full life of one (cf. Cab. Minister). The other is

entitled to full citizenship.

A.B. What of others? Man can confer patronage &amp; is in receipt of it.

No hardship if he has to choose betwn. career than another.

There shd. be code of conduct for Ministers.

Must draw the line somewhere – or nepotism will grow.

R.S.C. Shd. a Party Govt. appoint to offices of profit officers of its own

Party?

H.M. Decent standards. But not hard &amp; fast rules.

Don’t restrict enrichment of public life.

N.B. Need to be above suspicion. A good code of rules may be helpful

to us at a certain time.

Risk in Labour movement is individuals trying to do too much.

91

P.M. Ready to limit 4(a) to Treasurer and Secretary. Say “executive

officer of any political Party.” To include agents &amp; organisers.

Indicate general principle – wh. must be applied to individual

cases.

Agreed: “officer carrying out executive duties for a political Party.”

Approved subject to points noted above.

5. National Theatre.

R.S.C. As in memo.

H.M. L.C.C. contn shd. be substantial in relation to Ty. Is value of site

sufficient?

N.B. Yes, v. valuable.

A.B. Shd. Esher Cttee buy themselves in so cheaply?

R.S.C. Ty. will in fact control it. Arts Council is subject to financial control

by Ty.

We might want to add a Concert Hall.

P.M. Lr. from B. Ayrton Gould.

R.S.C. Have talked to her. She is satisfied with what I intend.

Can’t build more than one for years. It will be a ques. wtr. we

start by re-bldg. Queen’s Hall or bldg. a new one. If we reserve

site for second, we shall be O.K.

N.B. First need: settle national theatre ques., after 30 years.

This is matter for next Parlt. &amp; next Election (Programme).

Tho’ I agree tht. legn reserving this site shd. be passed this

Session.

Chance for B. Festivals. Wd. bring tourist dividends too.

H.M. Warning v. Ty. going too far in London. Thought L.C.C. shd. look

after the concert hall. This memo. is enough pro tem. for Ty.

offers.

A.B. More facilities needed to rebuild theatres e.g. Gaiety &amp; Court.

E.B. Cd. one Hall be remembrance for war? U.S. mght. contribute.

A.B. Overseas countries cd. contribute materials.
