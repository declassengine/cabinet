C.M. 76(48) 25th November 1948

[Enter W.W.

1. Parliament.

H.M. Only one Oppn. amendmt. on Guillotine Resoln. genl., not particular.

Business for next week.

Wed. Nat. Service Bill. M/L. Bill. M/D. concerned : S./S. War concerned ques. nos.

Does P.M. wish to intervene.

A.V.A. Opposn. will want discuss on basis of Defence as a whole.

P.M. W.S.C. is askg. for a day on Defence, preferably in S. Session.

I stalled, to consult E.B.

Don’t like S. Session idea. W.S.C. says it strengthens Govt. It may.

But I don’t like it in peace.

They may therefore want to range widely. Must find out their intentns.

M/L. shd. open. M/Def. shd. come in. M/L. to spk. shortly on technicalies.

A.V.A. There are no technicalities. I shall be criticised for change of mind in ’46.

Better to open the general case – not wait for attack.

H.M. ???? But if M/L. speaks v. shortly first : Opposn. can then widen debate if they wish : cd. M/D. intervene around 6 pm. and S./S. War reply.

R.S.C. Open on real merits. M/Defence business.

A.B. &amp; A. Agreed.

A.B. Let G.A.I. be ready to intervene : A.V.A. say so early. Then S./S. War cd. reply. Agreed : M/D. (G.A.I. intervening if necessary). E.Sh. to reply.

Foreign Affairs Debate.

In v. near future. Probly. in week after next.

[Enter Wh. and C.M.

2. Commonwealth Relations. Eire.

P.M. Amended in light of Dom. comments.

Costellos’ speech (extract) read.

I saw Opposn. – W.S.C., M-Fyfe &amp; Cl. Davies. Cousin. not v. forthcomg. but W.S.C. less fierce than I had supposed.

315

Statement in both Houses – must convert replies to supplementaries.

A. J. to make statement in H/Lds.

P.M. Move up reference to N. Ireland.

Say no more about views of B. Brooke.

Amend reference to B. Brooke – make it more personal.

Position of loyalists : discussed. Agreed : reply – no worse off.

A. Children of loyalists – not able to opt. Is this so?

C.E. Significance of “comparable”.

P.M. Intentional. We agreed to use this word because the rights may not be identical. Eg. on franchise we may give more than they.

Genl. posn. may be comparable even tho’ exchange of particular rights may not be the same.

eg. also other Comm. countries, when identical : rights can’t be concluded.

Text of statements approved.

H.M. Reactions of other Govts. not v. favourable. eg. Canada and N. Zealand.

3. Ceylon : Application for Membership of U.N.

H.B. Don’t think we can change our policy.

C.M. Intervention by Evatt. How shd. we handle that?

P.M. Why strain at Outer Mongolia when we swallowed Ukraine?

C.M. She has no relations with f. countries at all.

6 western 5 non-western applns. now outstanding.

A. In the real world this horse trading does go on.

Not a bad thing if we cd. get these people in.

R.S.C. China wd. never agree to Mongolia.

H.M. Diff. for F.O. to swallow a country wh. has no f. relations.

C.M. We have said we won’t use our veto.

But we really can’t go around lobbying.

A.B. Israel?

316

C.M. Ready to recognise when a settlement reached. Then appln. to U.N. in due course. Can’t materialise soon.

N.B. Ceylon will in the end realise tht. this action wd. put us in false position. We can get her into special agencies. We can say publicly it’s monstrous tht. R. shd. oppose their appln.

Agreed : stand firm. no trading.

4. Military Training (Facilities) Bill.

[Exit C.M.

[Enter Parly Secies. W.O., M/Ag. T.C.P.

M.St. Brings up to date Mil. Manoeuvres Acts. But change requd. because a) N. Service b) mechanised forces.

Cd. try by agreement but wd. be uneven.

Some details to be settled with M/H. and T.C.P.

A.V.A. Authy. to draft given by L.P. Cttee in April.

P.M. Why needed now if powers don’t expire until 1950.

H.M. Must be in this Session : - needed early because short of legislation.

One point : amend Cl. 3(1) to protect “nature reserves”.

M.St. We can do this.

J. V. far reaching powers. Lets Army go anywhere and do anything.

Won’t be liked by H/Lds.

King.. No genl. objn. Cl. 6 : want same protection for foreshore.

M.St. We shd. be prepd. to agree.

A. What safeguards v. open gates and broken fences?

This gives me the creeps.

M.St. Compensn. clauses will keep Services on their toes.

H.M. These points were argued in L.P. Cttee. Details on Bill can be taken in Legn. Cttee.

M.St. Shan’t use the powers much.

J. The old story. Won’t wash.

P.M. Why empower Army to take tractors on land?

317

M.St. To enable T.A. to be trained – on land nearby : where units aren’t in reach of W. Dpt. land for training.

A. Needs v. careful vetting.

R.S.C. Has been – by all Dpts. concerned, incldg. M/Agric.

P.M. But is it wise to be so unpopular.

M.St. If we intend to make proper use of N. Service men – as we are told we are not.

H.M. Remit to Legn. Cttee. to see what safeguards can be introduced.

Then I can report back to P.M.

P.M. Told Mil. Manoeuvres Act is “cumbrous”. That presumably means tht. the public interests are protected.

A.V.A. Astonishing how agric. prodn. was increased in the war, when savage powers of entry were available under D.R.

J. Proceed by amendmt. of M. Manoeuvres Act?

Agreed : Remit to Legn. Cttee (L.P.S. attending) to consider safeguards etc. and report.

[Exit M.St. and King.

5. Housing Bill.

A.B. As in memo.

It is decision of owner to make a tied cottage – makes it part of carrying on of his business. Then it becomes part of industrial hereditament – and l.a. need not be concerned with it as housing. If he wants aid, he must grant a tenancy and put himself at mercy of court if he wants to displace tenant.

Intolerable tht. l.a.’s shd. use on their cottages materials requd. for genl. housing needs.

My formula transfers onus from us to owner.

Politics. I cdn’t defend spending public money on tied cottages.

Parly Party have passed 2 resolns. v. tied cottages as such.

Raised constantly on Executive.

Don’t press me to do somethg. repugnant to Party.

Agric Dpts. have powers under Hill Farming Acts to give grants in remote areas. Some areas where this wdn’t apply : but deal with it elsewhere than in Housing Bill.

A. Agree new cottages must have precedence.

But my memo. foreshadows consequences. Calamitous effects.

318

Most tied cottages go with farms. Wd. like to see them freed. But if grants are available for re-conditioning – anomalies will arise, neighbouring cottages one tied, one free. Immense nos. of free cottages are let to week-enders. This policy wd. prejudice the improvemt. of all agric. workers cottage unless owner is ready to untie it.

Urge Minister to devise scheme wh. won’t involve situation tht. least chance of getting re-conditioned to farm worker.

Br. In 1946 Act grants available for new houses for agric. workers where tenant can be rid of.

Two tied cottages : a) service cottage with no tenancy at all.

b) tenancy, subject to R.R. Act, but under that Act farmer need not prove altern. accommn. That sort can be built with grant.

M/H. Proposal therefore applies more stringent condns. to improvg. than to bldg.

On politics : don’t think it diff. to defend. We aren’t defending tied cottages. We are saying while there are tied cottages we want to see them improved. We can defend that.

T. &amp; G. Workers aren’t opposed to this line. Hobhouse Cttee. came down firmly on ‘our’ side.

Ques. therefore is one of method. Tenancy cases : if farmer wants possn. he comes to panel apptd. by A.E.C. These cottages cd. all therefore be untied, when you are ready to amend R.R. Act.

Service cottage : diff. to spend widely.

We cd. make adminve. arrangemt. with M/H. by wh. latter wd. have to be satisfied tht. it was unreasonable to grant a tenancy.

Real issue is not the tied cottage : it is wthr. we shall tell farm workers tht. they alone will not be helped to decent housing.

A.W. I accepted A.B. view there is Party decision preventg. any action in E. &amp; W.

But views of M/Ag. not then before us.

On merits, we can’t justify depriving benefit fr. farm workers alone.

It is they who live in the cottages. We can prevent owner from getting profit out of it.

A.B. says farmers can afford to do it w’out grant. But in fact worst cases are on tenant farmers’ land.

No prospect of early building.

Agric policy will be wrecked if we don’t make it possible for farm workers to live decently.

This Bill enables farmer to get grant for repair of own house – why not farm workers too.

Tied houses for miners and farm workers are now a privilege.

Do it for all workers and prevent owners fr. making a profit.

In Scotland I am providg. tht. if cottage is sold owner must refund.

319

A.B. That is agreed.

A.W. Applies to miners also. Many are in tied cottages.

Dairies and cattle : l.a. can’t build houses in middle of farms. Landowner is only source of housing …..

Support M/Agric. therefore throughout. Believe Party cd. be persuaded.

G.A.I. Unless we can assure people there is a cottage, we can’t get people to take work on farms. Support M/Agric.

H.M. L.P. Cttee point. Memo. was put in. Points in discn. M/Health expld. pol. opposn. and proposed tht. this shd. apply only in areas where ample provn. of new houses. Wasn’t in memo. A.B. was authorised to discuss on this basis.

We must now discuss on merits.

Party Confce. was demanding end of tied cottages. That is another matter. Issue here is : shall we deprive farm worker in tied cottages of repair benefits available to other workers.

Supposed safeguard – “owner can untie”. Can he? Forestry Commn. tie cottages. Untieing it may involve gt. damage to agriculture.

G.A.I.’s point also.

Politically, it is madness to penalise farm workers in tied cottages (and his wife) on the argument tht. you are penalising the owner.

On merits, clear grant shd. be available. On politics, not so difficult.

Support M/Agric. view.

P.M. Not an effective step in campaign v. tied cottage. It will hit wrong person.

R.S.C. Two classes of case. a) Service cottage, not a true let. Tenant is at mercy of landlord. b) Tenancy with special provns. under R.R. Act and owner has to go to court to get possession.

Legitimate to except a) from grant. Much more diff. to refuse it to b). If you follow that line, you will be discouraging tied cottages.

I wd. therefore support A.B.’s test on a), but not on b).

A. Overlooks reality. No. 10 is a service cottage. What about a cowman’s cottage : service occupn. often in bad condn. why w’hold grant from these?

R.S.C. He can go over to class b). If he won’t, then give him no grant.

320

A.B. The farmers cd. afford to repair the cottages. They are so prosperous.

Br. 80% of our farmers own less than 100 acres.

A.B. Farmers are buying cottages, to get labour. There is therefore wide area of cottages under R.S.C.’s (b).

I am ready to accept R.S.C.’s formula.

Br. Cd. it be left open to consider isolated cottages?

H.M. Let Dpts. consider R.S.C.’s formula.

A.W. Doubt if this will do for Scotland.

Wh. No legal diffy. in acceptg. it in Scotland.

Practical diffy. is – rather than lose the advantage of having it tied, owner will decline to move into class (b). No incentive to move.

Turns on labour supply. If no competn. and surplus of labour his hand won’t be forced.

P.M. You now have a shortage of labour in agriculture.

J. Much to be said for encouraging repair of class (a).

Agreed : accept R.S.C. compromise, subject to examn. of details. Any diffies. can be reported to L.P. Cttee.

A.V.A. Comply with principle in para. 3.

G.T. a) This was a Tory proposn. to put money into landlord’s pockets.

b) Can’t allow worker to be turned out w’out notice.

[Exit W.W., Brown.

6. Western Frontiers of Germany and Saar. [Enter Henderson

Hen. As in memo.

P.M. Are Benelux content?

H. Dutch hoping for some more.

J. Big claims abandoned. Pity tht. we shd. be standg. out v. some small claims. wh. seem to be supported by everyone else. Am I right?

Hen. Br. repves. on w. party were told to keep to views of 6 Power.

J. P. 11. B. seems to be one such example.

N.B. These minor rectifications do no good and cause much friction. Principle of keeping these down to minimum is wise.

321

A.B. Also Br. members were prob. watchg. German interest.

Approved.
