C.M. 11 (48) 5th February, 1948

1. Parliament.

H.M. Business for next week.

2. Wages Policy

P.M. T.U.C. have written complaining of not being consulted. No substance in this as we have bn. talking to them in genl. terms for months. And they can’t be consulted in advance on a text. They complain also of timing.

We must stand firm on this.

3. Parliament Bill

A. H/L. have accepted the formula – with gratitude.

E.B. How long will conference take?

A. Not long. On time, doubt if we’ll reach agreement for H/C. not ready for concessions.

P.M. Who will be in the talks?

A. Salisbury &amp; Swinton &amp; A.N. Other. A.E. or Q.S. (not W.S.C.).

Samuel.

H.M. Cl. Davies has suggd he and Perth shd. also be in it.

I warned him to limit it to 2; dropping Perth.

A. Want H.M. P.M. and prs. C.E.

A.B. Will talks go concurrently with Bill?

P.M. Our view = Bill must go thro’ first. But Bill won’t be enlarged to cover composition.

A.B. Can they hold Bill up?

H.M. No: Because they’ve agreed to pass or reject this Session.

[Exit W.W., A.B., C.E.

[Enter H.G., B., G.S., J.S.

4. Economic Affairs

R.S.C. Latest figures of dollar drain.

62

Diffies with I &amp; Pakistan. Some progress. Diffy: get them to agree to some supervision by us – to prevent their exceeding their estimates.

V. satisfy. agreemt. with Switzerland. S. behaved v. well: wanted early agreement to support sterling re depreciated franc. We may even get gold fr. them because they agree to hold sterling.

Relax travel ban and still save gold.

E.B. Why wasn’t it beamed more? If with R., wd. have bn. head-lined.

R.S.C. Did our best. Papers wdn’t use it.

E.B. B.B.C. cd. have done better.

Can you now pay tribute to their co-opn by P.Q.

R.S.C. Yes.

E.B. Portugal, too, gave v. good agreement: but no praise.

Must work up the W. European unity this way.

H.W. B.B.C. too prone to high-light Russia. Their answer is always: R. is news.

E.B. Swiss agreement is worth 4 or 5 times as much, qua b/payments, as R. grain agreement.

P.M. Let H.M. talk to Chairman of B.B.C.

Agreed.

R.S.C. Talks with Italy, tho’ only partly successful, have bn. fruitful.

Argentine. Shall get it or break to-day.

They are short of sterling. We have offered pre-paymt. of a year’s supplies. Prices &amp; quantities agreed = also transmn of interest. Stuck only on free imports from U.K.

U.S. have asked us to buy maize for Germany for dollars.

There is some trouble in W’ton over this, in wh. F.O. are assisting us.

H.W. If this goes thro’ it means no dollars.

R.S.C. Leeper has done v. well over this.

Has shown advantage of heading Delgn with business man &amp; bringing Ambassador in when diffies arise.

E.B. Agreed.

This is working v. well generally.

P.M. Textiles going v. slow.

63

E.B. Won’t overcome diffies until solution has bn. found of problem of incentives. This is a matter for Budget: hope R.S.C. will try to solve it. Speeches won’t solve it.

P.M. B’cast by G.T.?

G.T. We have never got down to number of types of cotton workers.

Men running 4 = men running 20 looms. Second £7-8 a wk. but others only £4. Diff. to recruit men for latter wage. Our figures are averages.

Full econ. posn must be put over in Lancs.

H.W. Cttee here &amp; in Regions. Hoping to run local propaganda campaign. But must get adminve ques. settled first.

e.g. call-up. bldg. day nurseries. Overtime drive = better in early spring. Will start it with G.T. b’cast: &amp; a big mtg. with him &amp; me. C.O.I. local organisation.

H.G. Coal. [Two points not heard.]

Diffies over continuing export of U.S. coal into Europe. U.S. coal interests are pressing it.

R.S.C. They forced France to go on takg. it even tho’ not paid for.

E.B. Let H.G. spk. to me personally over this.

H.M. Exports to soft-currency countries still running v. high.

H.W. Reason: Fulfilment of long standing orders copec. in India &amp; S. Doms.

Shall see results of these for some time.

Drive to h/currency began only Nov. 46 (?)

A.W. Firms with h/currency orders cd. have priority in delivering of materials.

H.W. That is done.

[Exit H.G., G.S., J.S., &amp; B.

5. Defence White Paper

A.V.A. Still interim year.

Figures approved already by Cabinet. £692m: not quite comparable with last year because more civil costs transferred to M/S.

N.S. intake. Being restricted to 150.000 – will also be necessary in later years up to 49/50. Because C.O.S. haven’t yet produced acceptable plans for future shape of forces.

64

E.B. Hope we shan’t in this Debate get back on C.O.S. Shdn’t overdo emphasis on them. Govt. must take full responsibility.

P.M. a) Amalgamation. “more satisfy.” goes too far. Alternative agreed.

b) Para. 60. In furthermore… Govt. have decided on followg. principles…” Agreed.

G.A.I. “By progressive raising age.” Make that the purpose. Not reducing the numbers. Change of emphasis. Will agree wording with A.V.A.

P.M. Shall be criticised for lack of definiteness. But can’t be, in fluid situation.

H.M. Put some obvious points of criticism. Must be prepared for these.

Research – excludes c. aviation &amp; atomic energy.

A.V.A. Neither.

H.M. Nice ques. of allocn. Is too much being landed on civil side?

Cd. some Ministers consider this?

R.S.C. Allocation is about right. Best we can do. Can only guess.

T.W. Para. 28. Takes a/c of w’drawal from Palestine?

A.V.A. Yes. Won’t affect total change v. much, may reduce overseas element.

H.W. Monkeying with age of call up.

a) Long notice to those affected.

b) Hope this won’t exclude possibility of extendg. deferments.

G.A.I. There is room in the figures. No concession now on principle.

P.M. No reference to Colonial Forces.

C.J. Discussions are procdg.

6. U.N.E.S.C.O. Second General Conference.

P’mme opns nearly 5m. What are the persons costing 51/2 m doing.

G.T. Figures are inclusive.

P.M. Avoid word “break-down”, generally.

Excessive establishments. Secretariat of 590!

H.M. High salaries: dupln of appointmts. for internatl reasons = no “Ty control.” All v. dangerous.

E.B. Second Deputy of U.N. at last appointed – Jackson. Shd. help to introduce more astringent control.

Our work on Budget Cttee of U.N. Presses U.S. to collaborate with us in continuous supervision over expenditure. Hope she will now be more helpful.

Hope U.N.E.S.C.O. will learn it do its work more cheaply because I attach importance to its work &amp; want it to succeed.

C.J. We have bn. getting into trouble in N. Yk. for our consistent attempts to cut down U.N.E.S.C.O. expenditure.

Agree need for continuing vigilance.

Pilot scheme of “fundamental educn ” in Nyasaaland &amp; N. Nigeria.

Discussing that with them.

J. Lot of nonsense here about cultural exchange. Music (unnecessary) &amp;

pictures (deplorable).
