C.M. 22 (48) 15th March, 1948

1. Foreign Policy in Europe.

H.McN. Explained draft Treaty, article by article.

Fairly smooth negotns. All have agreed save Dutch, who have asked for delay till 5pm. to-day. But don’t expect more than verbal suggns.

Expect to be ready for signature on Wed.

A.V.A. C.O.S. are studying implicns of Art IV. They incline to view tht. no practical plans cd. succeed w’out U.S. support. May get U.S. to under-write this.

H.M. Is “ armed attack” right? Limited to unprovoked aggression? Wd. it commit us to help if attack had bn. invited by provocative dipl. action?

H.McN. Art 51 imports that. But not clear they are carried in.

J. Take care not to water it down too much.

G.W. Doms. have seen: no comments received.

C.J. Does Art 1. include overseas territories?

P.M. Yes, by implication.

C.J. Would Art IV cover attack on Gib. and Malta?

P.M. Yes.

H.M. V. grave importance of this.

Importance of U.S. support.

Art II. Gt. complications because their standards must be lower than ours pro-tem. When concrete proposns emerge L.P. Cttee shd. see them.

Need for publicity for E.B.’s speech and this Treaty. F.O. shd. pay special attentn to this. On signature, cd. F.O. get B.B.C. to do some special feature &amp; running commentary + musical accompaniment. Interruption of p’mmes. Newsreels also.

Need for continuing publicity effort by F.O. – with assistance from good P.R.O.’s. Chance to seize publicity initiative.

P.M. Steer comment away from Art IV. Concentrate on Art I.

H.M. Notes for Ministers speeches.

J. Italian Elections 18/4. Hope attentn will be drawn to provn for other nations to join.

117

A.W. Art VIII. Albanian dispute court found diffy. in acting judicially.

R.S.C. Diffy. was because Albania hadn’t agreed to submit.

2. International Trade Organisation.

H.W. This memo. explains differences from Geneva text, which was approved by Cab. and Parlt.

Ques.: Shd. we sign or stand out? If we stood out, we shd. do so alone.

World Confce at Havana – includes 60 nations, many of them difficult. Various problems overcome.

Various drafting amendments.

Various minor changes – mainly to our advantage.

Three major issues – a) quotas for development.

U.S. have yielded on this to get S. Americans in.

We don’t like new text. But don’t dislike it enough to stand out on this. R.S.C. agrees. E.P.C. agreed on 11/12 tht. we cdn’t. expect to prevent developmt. of under-developed countries.

And it’s subject to “posterior disapproval”.

Doms. of course favour this.

b) Non-discrimination. Big struggle: R.S.C. and I have seen U.S. Ambassador. Draft emerged from sub-Cttee y’day which improves on our Geneva posn. Provides 3 options for all countries (i) I.M.F. rules (ii) discriminate up to 1952 up to extent we were in 15th Feb. ’48. (iii) Geneva rules as approved by Cab. previously.

This means, while in b/p diffies, we are free to discriminate up to ’52 with virtually no post disapproval: thereafter more freedom than in Geneva draft.

All academic while we are subj. to s. 9. of Loan Agreemt.

But when this agreed we can substitute it for s. 9.

Adminn have promised to discuss when Havana signed.

This = our only hope of getting out of art. 9.

We must ratify here until art. 9 is out of the way.

[But demand for earlier debate.]

c) Preferences. S. Am. and M/E. countries made it key issue at Havana. tht. regions shd. be allowed to introduce new preferences. Doms. supported it. We said we cdn’t allow that &amp; not have it cover Dom. preferences. U.S. then agreed to interpretive note to Art. 9. This is far from perfect from our angle. I. &amp; O. “need not”. But it may interpret this as requiring contiguity.

All I can say is tht. it gives us some chance of getting new or increased preferences.

New change: automatic approval of changes requd for development appd under the Charter. This agreed over week-end.

Point = political rather than economic. Our developmt. schemes in Commonwealth won’t be based on preferences. Also

118

Doms. are against us on this. They don’t feel nearly so strongly in favour of preferences.

Canada looking more to U.S. A. and N.Z. are giving priority to developing secondary industries. And wd. prefer to build up trade with us by bulk purchase etc.

A. Relieved by new messages from Havana.

On c). App. 9 (Art 15). 2/3rds majority required.

Interpretn of “economic region”. Cd. get round it by bulk

purchase etc. But foresee many disputes.

Don’t believe “economic region” really means anything.

Tho’ not so vital prs. if we rely on bulk purchase etc.

On b) Latest draft transforms the situation.

Early draft (App 10). Parly. diffy. because didn’t release us

from Art. 9 of Loan Agreemt.

Essential not to ratify until U.S. has ratified and released

from Art. 9.

R.S.C. Only purpose of interpretative footnote is to cover B. Commonwealth.

Every one knows that. No doubt cd. ever arise that this covered us.

P.M. Most stupid way of handling it.

R.S.C. I agree. But are we to lose I.T.O. because of this?

A. Can we say: we understand phrase to cover B. Comm.

H.W. x/ Yes: not only that. But cd. add we shall watch working of I.T.O. &amp; if it works to disadvantage of B. Comm. we shall come out. Make this statement at moment of signing.

A.B. This language will involve v. diff. political situation for us.

Land-mass contiguity conception. Hitler, Stalin and now U.S.A. Ignores the ship. Tories will say this is end of B. Empire. To reply tht. Doms. ndn’t support us won’t help - for they will say that’s due to faulty U.K. leadership.

Even at this stage we shd. try to get better words here.

U.S. have let us down eg. over synthetic rubber.

H.W. Qua B. Comm. we are better off than at Geneva, where we had no power to make new preferences or increase old.

The attack must be tht. others have even more power.

Right answer is: we aren’t in Ottawa period – developmt. schemes, long-term contracts etc.

R.S.C. And this = Australian proposal. And all Doms. thought it enough for their purposes and ours.

Do you refuse to sign if you can’t get better words?

119

P.M. You can only make declaration as at x/ on signature.

No discrimination in this against B. Commonwealth.

J. Add in 4(a) “such as that which now exists between countries of B. Commonwealth.”

R.S.C. How cd. Clayton accept such words?

Agreed on c). Try to get better words: if we fail, make

declaration as at x/.

A. On b): Effect on our posn under Art. 9 of loan.

Geneva rules alternative. Can we opt for it at once?

R.S.C. Yes. Release fr. Art. 9. only with U.S. Govt. But the Loan Agreemt. contemplated Art. 9 wd. give place to any internatl agreed formula. And we can press U.S. to release us from Art. 9. as soon as this is agreed.

A. What happens after 1952? Must apply to Organisations?

H.W. At Geneva: prior approval needed to m’tain.

Now provided: can continue after 1952, but other countries can complain. For new discrimns prior approval will be required.

Agreed: Authorise Delegation to sign subject to decision noted above re Preferences.

[Exit: H.McN. &amp; G.W.

3. Fees for Less of Development Values.

L.S. As in memo.

Submitd to Cab. because amount of fees may be. v. large (£14 m).

R.S.C. Para. 6 overstates my concurrence.

Diff. point.

a) Tho’ we mean to pay only £300m. agreed claims will total £1.000 – 1.500m. Discussed at length with Eve to see wht. amount paid in costs cd. be related to £300m. But can’t because total amounts won’t be settled for 3 years.

b) No qualification can be defined. Risk therefore of racketeers claiming Govt. fees. Thought of discussing with Chartered Surveyors wht. order can be brought into this “profession”. £14m = 5 years receipts of the profession. We must at least be sure it goes to honest men.

A.B. How did you pay £66m to coal?

A.W. In Scotland this is mostly done by Solrs.

120

L.S. Agree we must define who can do it.

R.S.C. But how?

P.M. Can’t you set up State organisation. And those who don’t go to it can pay own fees.

A.B. What of distributing the £60m. to doctors. Are we to pay those fees?

L.S. Different because we aren’t paying the real value – only 4/= in £.

R.S.C. Administrative argument is the only one which appeals to me.

T.W. That’s the point: need to get it done quickly &amp; well by reliable people.

H.M. Cd. claimants reach agreemt. with Valuer.

R.S.C. Ordinary man can’t formulate a claim. Can’t therefore start the thing off w’out skilled assistance.

A.B. Better to employ a no. of people on a salary to whom claimants may go.

R.S.C. Not available to hire.

J. You wdn’t get good professionals anyway under this scheme.

At least honest rag tag &amp; bobtail wd. come in.

R.S.C. But the dishonest racketeer wd. be excluded.

A.V.A. Am opposed in principle to paying claimants fees.

R.S.C. Will cost Land Bd. twice as much to unravel claims made w’out professional help.

P.M. Can’t Govt. publish a panel of people &amp; fees.

A. Where will this stop?

P.M. How did you think when Bill was going thro’ tht. this was going to be done? Was this envisaged?

L.S. No.

Indisposed to favour principle of paying fees.

Ty. &amp; T.C.P. to devise alternative scheme.

[Exit L.S.

121

4. Pay of Senior Police Officers.

C.E. As in memo.

V. much concerned about Police efficiency. Wd. be diff. to m’tain their confidence in good faith of central Govt. if this bargain, made long before W. Paper, were dishonoured.

Scotland were kept fully informed throughout.

Commend my proposals, as in memo.

A.W. Sympathise with C.E.

My predecessor didn’t join this Cttee

a) our l.a.’s had made us demand

b) we have fewer scales

c) we had no compuls. amalgamn of Forces

But demand from Federation – for increases - heavy pressure.

That is my fear. Will it make for good feeling in Force to give advances to senior men &amp; then clamp down on rank &amp; file. Fedn will quote W. Paper against us.

Repercussions on fireman etc.

Workers don’t like police – don’t regard them as productive.

Thought H.O. wd. not be committed by report.

Wiser to hurry on the main enquiry: and ask Ch. C.’s to wait, as a patriotic act.

R.S.C. Diff. to assert to H.O. proposal.

Wd. be, not only agreeing to higher rates, but forcing unwilling l.a.’s to do so.

W. Paper have express undertakg. tht. Govt. wd. not increase. We have taken that line re Civil Service. If we do this for Police, repercussions will start.

If we do this for higher salaries, how can we ask rank &amp; file to wait?

G.A.I. Support H.O. Negotiations started early ’47: decision reached: accident that it hasn’t bn. implemented.

W. Paper was addressed to new negotns.

To support principle of collective bargaining, we must put this thro’.

H.M. These are not negotiations. They had no power to settle.

A.B. Agree. This = enquiry. L.a.’s tell me they are resisting because wd. have repercussions throughout l.a. employees.

Cab. at last mtg. asked me to send W. Paper to all l.a.’s. I’ve done so. Can Cab. now agree to this? Delay caused by reluctance of l.a.’s to make these increases?

H.M. F. Divn. is windy. This language in memo. in relation to Co. Ch.C’s, is overdone. L.a.’s are in gt. difficulty over staff pay: N.A.L.G.O. etc. C.C. Assocn have rejected: Sc. l.a.’s are all against it.

Some of these salaries are diff. to defend e.g. Rutland.

122

A. This completes Police pay review concluded by end ’46 for r/file.

Agreed { Defer this action

{ C.E. will consider his posn vis-à-vis Ch.C’s.

{ P.M. or R.S.C. to join him in explaining to

Ch.C’s.
