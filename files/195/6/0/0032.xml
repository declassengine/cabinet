C.M. 33 (48) 27th May, 1948

1. Parliament Bill.

[Enter W.W.

P.M. Business for next week.

2. Commonwealth - Nomenclature.

P.M. Don’t use ‘white’ Doms. New or old, if you like.

[Exit W.W.

[Enter E.Sh., L.S., A.H.

3. Stanford Training Area.

L.S. As in memo.

H.M. Gt. personal difficulty.

W.D. case not v. strong.: if limited to 30.000 Territorials.

Pledges were v. real, Tenants were cleared out on categorical undertakgs. by Army Commr. tht. they wd. be allowed to come back. Dept. Reg. Commr. with my authy. backed line up. They left on that basis, for patriotic reasons. No doubt or dispute about pledges. Wd. be v. bad to break them – or even to ask tenants to release us.

Wd. affect confidence in Govt. pledges.

Addl point re Lucerne drying factory - £115.000 on faith of pledge.

A.V.A. Recognise these diffies But our task = see troops efficiently trained.

Stanford: no other site is suitable. Not a high-class agric. area. Impartiality of T.C.P. No-one can suggest where else training can be provided.

Nos. to be trained. In such an area can’t have more than 1.000 men at a time. Reliance on Terr. Army means they must be equally trained. 30.000 in one season is therefore a big contribution.

Pledge: quoted from P.M.’s C.P. of June 1947, suggesting compensn. para. 48 of W. Paper. W.O. had then sacrificed much as cpd. with earlier demands.

Public enquiry now held. Vital matter of defence: I cdn’t accept I.S. suggn we shd. leave it to vote of inhabitants. Govt. must take responsibility – one way or another. Tho’ we shd. have to explain posn to inhabitants.

Minimum W.O. requirmt. is the 5 areas. That shd. be clear.

Cost: Expense of clearing out wd. be substantial (1/2 m. at least) &amp; wd. take 4 or 5 years. And cost of acquiring less satisfy. area elsewhere.

[Exit H.W.

Decide to-day on Stanford. Purbeck pledge is not on same footing.

165

E.Sh. Army Commr. was pressed at time to give a pledge: gave it half. heartedly. Nothing new re pledge. Cab. agreed, on W. Paper, to our getting 640.000 acres &amp; several battle-training areas – knowing all about pledge. Need these areas because proved we suffered fewer casualties in war on a/c of this training.

1,000 were evacuated – to emergency accommn elsewhere. Don’t know how many of these have gone further a field.

Even if we found alternative area, we shd. have to spend much on it.

Cab. has agreed we need land for b. training. Gt. diffy. in getting this land elsewhere: in all the other areas we are having trouble.

No alternative site in E. Anglia.

Nos. to be trained. In a year, 1 Divis + Arm. Brig. wd. be used to train Terr. 30.000 in a year is substantial. And may be more.

Agree it’s v. diff. position. But cf. Ashdown Forest: L.S. and I have talked them round. Same in some areas in Wales. Suggest we follow same course here. Put it to local people frankly. May find many are content elsewhere. Cd. offer compn to the others. Try it out: without denying there was a pledge.

Estimated £280.000 might have to be paid in compensn. Cheaper than clearing out &amp; going elsewhere.

Lucerne factory. Might be allowed to continue: wd. enquire into that.

P.M. Shd. get down to individual cases &amp; see what hardship is involved. Only way to get over pledge is to see that no injustice is done to individuals.

T.W. 38 farmers were removed: 19 with farms over 100 acres. Don’t know where they have gone.

If 9.000 acres area has to be found, we know of none wh. wd. do less damage to agric. than Stanford. Take therefore Stanford rather than any other.

P.M. No ques. of dodging pledge. Must take line that natl emergency &amp; requiremts. make it inexpedient to honour it.

Try to place the individuals vice money compensn.

M/Ag. shd. help.

E.B. Create organisation for owners &amp; tenants to deal with /x.

No rigid rules for all. Deal with them one by one.

J. Must be way of dispensing with pledge. Parlt. is authy to give us dispensn. We cd. go to House &amp; ask to be relieved.

G.A.I. Don’t go to Parlt. until all cases investigated &amp; we go only on outstanding cases we can’t settle.

[Exit J.

A.V.A. Para. 45 of W. Paper is quite consistent with dealing with cases individuals.

166

P.M. A.V.A. shd. explain posn to the King.

{ W.O., T.C.P., Ty., M/Ag. to get at facts on this individual basis.

{ Meeting on the spot to explain what we intend:

{ ask H/C. to release us fr. pledge: then go into cases individually.

Agree: on this basis.

[ Exit L.S.

[Enter H. Shawcross &amp; H.

4. Death Penalty in Services.

A.V.A. As in memo. Can we do it by amendment of Cl. 70?

H.M. No. Because H/L. will delete Cl. 1 in all probability.

H. No diffy. in doing it by amendmt. of Service Codes.

H.M. Wd. prefer to wait – for don’t know what we shall have to do on cl. 1.

Approved substance.

Reserve decision on method.

5. Economical Affairs.

R.S.C. Total man power much as planned.

Planned contraction of bldg. &amp; c. eng. indies isn’t going to happen because original decn modified.

Rise in textile indies shown than planned. Partly because level of women’s earnings . cf. Table 13-14. They don’t induce women to leave other indies.

Worst = coal.

H.G. To Easter well up to target or higher. Haven’t picked up betwn. Easter &amp; Whitsun.

Man-power.

a) Exodus of ballotees[sic] v. heavy.

b) f. man-power expected in 2nd half. Didn’t therefore expect much more. It’s O.M.S. tht. is worst. 3-4% lower than expected: partly because O.M.S. &amp; partly because absenteeism. N.C.B. have little to say on either point. Absenteeism prob. due to fine weather. O.M.S.: revision/tasks condn of 5 day wk. haven’t been carried thro’. Grimethorpe settled that. Not due to lack/equipmt. May poss. be some increase in developmt. work.

Considered discn with men &amp; N.C.B. Doubt it if no specific points to put. Cd. put revision/tasks: extra hours (incldg. ½ hr. vice Saty). Delayed because don’t want to act too soon after Reid’s resign. Also want to see if we pick up after Whitsun holiday. If no improvemt. I shall have to act on these lines.

167

P.M. Efficiency of managemt.?

H.G. No v. marked diffce betwn. one pit &amp; another wh. cd. be attributed to variety in managemt.

Newsome (in reply to H.M.) resigned because Reid’s statement to Sc. miners. But personal factors behind it. And he isn’t an easy man. Mistake to try to persuade him to stay on with N.C.B.

A.B. 1/2 hour vice Sat. Get back to that.

Don’t expect too much from mechanisation in B. pits.

Don’t high-light absenteeism overmuch. Get down to pit managers: &amp; improve organisation.

H.G. Much too depends on Union leadership.

T.W. Extra 1/2 hour no good w’out increased stint.

We have 5 day wk. in return for a promise, which hasn’t been carried out. Our duty to say so. H.G. ought to see them.

R.S.C. Steel going v. well.

Housing in better balance. Nos. contracts let have bn. increased.

A.B. Completion rate will fall twds. end/year.

Takes long time to start. Also am insisting on competition tendering, wh. makes more delay.

But shall still be above completion rate of 200.000 a year.

Licensing limit. Unless unemplt. figures rise want to discuss this again.

R.S.C. At Prodn Cttee.

R.S.C. External Trade.

April larger gap. B/T. figures don’t corr. b/payments figures.

Increased prices = main cause of higher import figures plus small increase in quantity from soft areas.

Exports to hard areas = 18% (cfd. 17% in 1947) in last quarter.

Better than planned.

B/Payments. Righted itself in 2nd quarter. Only 26m drain because decline in Rest/St. Area drain + S. Afr. gold.

But her reserves are now so low they won’t be able to pay next quarter.

Warning tht. rate of drain will increase again next few wks.

Tendency to increase our imports fr. sterling area. Their balances are rising – as are those of soft currencies countries outside sterling area. More people are prepd to hold sterling. More confidence in sterling.

E.B. As it strengthens, uneven supply of capital &amp; consumer goods.

Sterling balances so high, &amp; orders so much lagging, there may be dissatisfn. Siam have mentioned it.

168

Need therefore to watch deliveries of orders keep pace with customers’ delivery of food etc. to U.K.

R.S.C. Late ordering prob. explains Siam’s diffy.

E.B. Siam want to make lump-sum settlemt. of outstanding matters.

N.B. Motor-exports. Are the cars running abroad?

R.S.C. Yes: pretty well: certainly in Canada.

A.B. Wages: Agric. conference asked for more. Roadmen are asking for it. The old cycle.

G.A.I. Believe both claims will go fwd.

A.B. But if l.a.’s increase expenditure Ty. &amp; l. will be in trouble.

L.a.’s ought to stand against roadmen. Wage index is rising.

R.S.C. Not so fast as it might.

P.M. Discuss this on Prodn Cttee.

E.B. When will shipping show net carrying invisible exports. B. Steel cut will reduce my p’mme.

R.S.C. No cut in steel. Shipping shd. earn substantially in 2 years time.

A. Tankers are critical to oil.

We cd. build more if we had more steel.

B. Admy &amp; l. are putting memo in Prodn Cttee.

E.B. Remember importance of shipping in f. policy.

[Exit H.G. &amp;.B., T.W.

6. Palestine.

E.B. No control over Abdullah since 15/5. He was to have gone only to Arab areas. But went to Jerusalem. Found he had 2 B. offrs. there: have w’drawn them.

Opposed Art. 3g because irrevocable. Sanctions wd. have widespread effects – down to Pakistan. Care of Jehad – 70m. in Pak.

U.S. proposed truce. I said wd. support it. Heard fr. Amman tht. Arabs wd. agree to Jerusalem Truce if Jews complied.

Urged also Mediator at once. Three points.

Just as I was getting it all right, Truman stepped in and recognised Israel. Then all my work was undone.

169

And I had to start all over again. And tried for the Cease Fire. That was alright, when Weilzmann statement came out: &amp; Arabs cdn’t lose face by accepting it. “I don’t get a chance”.

Shall have to do more about the 30 B. officers with Arab Legion. Thought they wd. help in controlling Arab rank &amp; file. But now another decn is required.

Loan. Note Marshall’s statement in Press tht. he knew nothing of it.

U.N. decision not so bad as it looks. If we can get Sec. Council to take a firm line.

Arabs will never recognise Israel. Never be good neighbours.

Neither party will sign agreemt. But Arabs wd. bow to stronger power. Wd. observe a U.N. decision. That seems only way out.

R.S.C. Hoffman’s promise to Senate to enquire wtr. U.S. money has bn. used by us to help Arab to fight Jews.

When we put Transjordan out of sterling area we had to provide her with dollars for current business. Did same to Palestine. A v. complicated situation – for Hoffman to look into.

Am having statement of facts drawn up. E.B. cd. then put it to U.S. Ambassador &amp; urge him to tell U.S. to come off it.

E.B. If it’s not this, it will be something else.

I’m not going to be threatened about effect on E.R.P. Have told Jackson I won’t speak at all under that threat.

A.B. Agree. Must grasp this nettle at outset. Must deny it gives U.S. right to examine what use we make of their assistance.

Take all the row at the outset.

Palestine: when do we recognise? Will we allow all Doms. to go ahead of U.K. in this?

E.B. Must wait a bit. I have appd Hugh Dow: arrives Jerus. to-day. A good Consul there, also. Dow will try to contact both sides. So we shall cease to be in present diffy. where we can talk direct to Abdullah but not to Shertok.

Seekg. further means of getting truce. Suggest giving Mediator a Mil. Cttee. for inspn (with aircraft etc.) Begin to build up posn of Mediator.

N.B. U.S. Guatemala &amp; Soviet group have recognised.

If all Doms. had recognised last Mon. it wd. have bn. awkward.

N.Z. are now holding off. Canada are against recognising .

Evatt is embarrassed.

7. Atlantic Regional Pact.

E.B. Discns re regional defence: U.S. are doing well. This will have more effect on E.R.P. than anything.

Pol. discns not military.

170

8. Discussions on Germany.

E.B. Will circulate memo. for decision Mon. or Tues.

On political organisation of Germany: may be agreemt.

Internatl control of Ruhr: Fr. have now accepted.

Security v. Germany: U.S. have gone far to meet French.

Memo. has now to be re-written. But as this is so vital (re-action of Russia) want a special mtg.
