C.M. 67(48) 28th October 1948

1. Parliament. [Enter W.W.

H.M. Business for next week.

W.W. Debate on Address. Spkr. thinks 2 days for Oppn. amendment. Prs. this wd. cover economic debate. On reflectn. he was inclined to think sep. econ. debate Mon. and Tues/Wed. on natn. generally.

Latest view : Defence on Mon : Oppn. amendmt. Tues/Wed. of which Tues. wd. be economic.

R.S.C. Can’t have my econ. debate (expln. of 4 White Papers – OECC etc.,) on Oppn. amendmt. Wd. have to do it separately : later.

H.M. Or earlier : tomorrow or Mon.

P.M. Spkr. is trying to run 2 Oppn. amendmts. if proposg. debate on Defence. I favour econ. debate Mon. and Oppn. amendment Tues/Wed.

H.M. Agreed : other members can refer to Defence m’while.

E.B. Unfortunate to discuss W. Union at this stage, Cab. hasn’t had my report. Want a considered policy, not merely my “suggns.”

Don’t want it mixed up with Debate/Address.

P.M. Then don’t answer W.S.C. if he speaks on this ques.

A.B. Agree. E.B. can’t be rushed into firm decln. of policy. But dangerous to allow too long an interval betwn. a W.S.C. speech and a Govt. reply. Allows him to capture initiative too much. Shdn’t a Govt. spokesman say something – even tht. it is ill-timed. irresponsible etc.

P.M. L.P. shd. follow W.S.C. today and deal with W. Union on these lines.

E.B. My genl. line has bn. to confine myself to position statements of Govt. policy and to avoid polemics with W.S.C. or others. Same policy in economic affairs has produced good results.

A.B. Agree in genl. but W.S.C. is in specl. posn. in world opinion. You can say eg. there is inconsistency betwn. Curzon Line argument and criticism of our giving independce. to India and Burma.

Agreed – procedure as above for today.

can’t have econ. discn. on Oppn. amendment.

(Press Spkr. to give one more genl. day on Mon.)

272

2. Tribunal of Enquiry.

C.E. Names. Lawyers’ advice in favour of Linskey. Risk of impn. tht. he is Jew. L.C.O. strongly recommends him as best available.

Not actively assocd. with politics.

L.C.J. will do it, if asked. But thinks that wd. unduly stress its importance. Much in that.

I therefore favour Linskey unless Cab. feel v. strongly against.

When Judge is chosen, shall consult him re others. Think. Russell Vick Chairman of Bar Council and Gerald Upjohn Chancery Counsel.

J. Concur.

R.S.C. So do I.

A.B. Guidance to Press re Linskey.

C.E. Yes.

P.M. Point of Lord Simonds.

J. Will say in H/L. tht. Tribunal will bear in mind what was said on this by Budget Leakage enquiry.

Strong feeling among Judges tht. A.G. shdn’t take lead in x-examn. Public wd. feel we wdn’t press his Min. colleagues. He shd. be present, but shd. leave conduct of “Police” side of case to another leading counsel.

H.M. I strongly agree. Also awkward as betwn. members of this Govt.

J. I haven’t discussed it with him : he is entitled to his own view.

E.B. He has Corfu case also, before intern. Ct.

J. The other counsel wd. be under his instns.

F.S. He intends to start Corfu case and hand over to me on 12th Nov. or so he inclines to think tht. we shd. conduct the Tribunal case – tho’ he is exercised as to how far we shd. x-amine colleagues etc.

He thinks tht. if he doesn’t do it Govt. may appear unable to use own A.G. – suggests complicity.

H.M. Awkward among colleagues. Also for subseqn. crim. procdgs.

R.S.C. Counsel must form view as to who is telling truth. May give impn. he is against Ministers and pro alien or pro Ministers against alien! Either way it will be open to misconstruction.

I think he shd. appear – say he is available to help but thought another counsel shd. conduct it. He wd. open and leave x-examinn. to the other.

If Tribunal then asks him to do it, he can. They prob. won’t.

273

Agreed : Cab. view to be commund. to A.G. – by S.G. and J.

3. Commonwealth Relationship.

P.M. Early history in memo. Since then much has occurred in talks.

Problem : how can we accommodate w’in Comm. Countries wh. can’t accept full allegiance to Crown.

Eire: intend abolish E.R. Act, and have declared not a member. At same time want close assocn. and reciprocal rights. They thus want to leave the club and yet retain all privileges. Risk of m.f.u. challenge.

India: in and wants to stay in. Some time ago, however, commd. themselves to sov., indep., republic. Problem : how far can that be made compatible with conting. membership?

Their mood has changed : want now to stay in : want to find ways and means.

Discn. with Eire Ministers at Chequers 4 Comm. countries were repd.

Examd. practical consequences. Diffies. if ……

J. No doubt in law that Eire will be out ….. India …..

My view now is provisional only. Want further consultn with L.O.’s when I know the facts.

Better if we have ascertained views of other members and can say they agree.

P.M. We discussed informally with some Comm. Ministers. To get Eire ques. away from old U.K./Ireland atmosphere. India too because diffies. with Opposns. etc. over attitude of Crown.

Genl. view of Doms. was we shd. try our best to keep people in.

Didn’t take the line tht. we shd. have compact small Comm.

R.S.C. “Times” this a.m. Might, if it went further, make big diffce.

Must regard posn. as quite fluid. Nehru is anxious to keep India in. When we get his 10 points, we ought to have straight legal view – tho’ pol. decn. needn’t be wholly bound by it.

Must do utmost keep India in. V. awkward if P. is in and I. is out.

N.B. Endorse P.M.’s remarks re views of other Comm. countries at mtg. Chequers. The others all sought means to keep Eire in. eg. last remarks by St Laurent; on citizenship link. Eire haven’t risen to that. They are commd. to being “out”. Fraser Evatt and prob. St. Laur. now accept that. But want best poss. friendly assocn. Irish think citiz. and trade cd. go on as now. I doubt it.

Hope L.C. will consider a) m.f.u. b) Statute of W’minster c) other U.K. domestic legn. – on basis of what is proposed.

C.R. Cttee thought minimum was Crown ques external relation. India won’t now accept that. Want to avoid controversy over Crown.

274

Careful thought – tho’ with basis of keeping India in. M.K.’s view tht. Crown shdn’t be allowed to be an obstacle to membership.

P.M. Nehru now in Paris. On return to India will put 10 points to his Cab.

R.S.C. If we say it’s worth his while.

P.M. Then he has Party Confce. and Const. Assembly. Decision therefore before end/1948. Shot across with Kashmir – wh. makes it more diff. for him to handle his Party.

First thing : get legal opinion.

E.B. a) I must be careful about m.f.u.

b) If connn. is too loose, may it not affect what we do with real members : eg. on exchange of (security) informn.

P.M. Indicated roughly what Nehru’s 10 points are.

Design wd. be : to build up a no. of small links justifying combn. tht. India is not foreign and can legally be treated as a member of Comm. Nexus based on a no. of small points.

A.W. Judicial Cttee of Privy Council?

R.S.C. That wd. go.

A.B. We can’t reach decns. until we know what Nehru can get across.

We shall have to consider posn. then.

What does stand out is – we cdn’t allow Eire to stay in on any terms less than India.

P.M. We may have to give Nehru tentative view on his points.

R.S.C. We ought to tell him at once if we think this sort of thing is out of the ques. If we don’t think that, we shd. encourage him to go on.

P.M. Diffce. btwn. India continuing in – and some country coming in.

Onus is different.

E.B. Preference side will have to be examined. Diff. to resist m.f.u. challenge.

A. Encouraged in my impression.

Other Doms. emphatic tht. we shdn’t be legalistic. May have to cast about for new links. Some of Nehru’s points seem to go a long way.

Eire must be a separate ques. Mark time on that. Other Doms. want us to patch up somethg. on this.

P.M. Can you? What about Ulster? P.Q.’s today. Suppose they repeal : we shall be asked to say “yes or no” wthr. E. is foreign and wthr. we propose to extend privileges etc. to f. country. What do you say? 275

A. Temporise.

C.E. Also appln. by Eire to internl. Ct. to end Partition.

A.B. Cdn’t we ask Eire to p’pone action until after India ques. settled.

P.M. They’ve said already they aren’t members. Commd. to it. Can’t hold it up.

A. Even so, delay fixing up some other assocns. until India settled.

P.M. Agree, but how long can you hold it because N. Ireland will act. They will ask wthr. Irish are entitled to a vote. Our own Tories will ask about Lpl. and Glasgow.

A.B. Need to put an argument in mouths of our friends in Eire. Eg. a solution for India which might be useful to Eire.

H.M. Can’t we tell them there is no way out – these diffies. are inevitable.

P.M. Doubt if we cd. get Can., Austr., and N.Z. to support that approach. They want us to ease off all the diffies.

H.D. Deal separately with the 2 ques.

More important to keep India in.

Hope lawyers can patch up somethg. which will stand up v. foreign challenge and not give offence to Indian opinion.

E.B. M.f.u. G.A.T. was concluded on basis tht. named countries were members. of Comm. When one isn’t any longer, posn. will be challenged.

J. Refer to L.O.’s the m.f.u. point about Eire.

E.B. Both G.A.T. and the Argentine.

P.M. And reciprocal arrangemts re. nationals.

H.D. Wd. loss of preference with Eire matter? No great concern

C.E. Other troubles, however – eg. land frontier.

A.V.A. How do we build up opinion m’while in reln. to Defence.

The 6 countries enables us to win B/Atlantic. Essential tht. they shd. remain in U.K.

A.B. Then we must check growth of Catholic popn. in the north.

E.B. I believe this is a well thought out part of Partition campaign.

276

They might now get into U.N. Then they will take Partn. to U.N. Pressure from U.S. because of Irish vote. Believe they know quite well what they are up to.

R.S.C. On A.B.’s suggn. don’t put ourselves in bargaining posn.

N.B. Cd. Dpts. now prepare a) draft statement of consequences, to be put to Irish.

b) How wd. we mitigate consequences to ourselves.

P.M. We ought to put a) to Eire Govt.

A.W. Told Eire Govt. are under pressure to do this. Presumably from I.R.A.

Are I.R.A. paid by Russia?

E.B. Don’t know.

A.B. If E. goes foreign U.K. will be involved in positive defence of Partition.

Effect on next Election.

4. “British Commonwealth” Title.

N.B. “British” dropped fr. communiqué. Genl. Comm. support for use.
