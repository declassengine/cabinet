C.M. 79(48) 9th December 1948

1. Parliament. [Enter W.W.

H.M. Business for next week.

A. H/Lords business. C.D. and N. Serv. Bill both to be finished by Thurs. Awkward but will manage.

Milk Bill may cause trouble.

P.M. Defeat of Govt. in H/L.

A. 15 or so went out rather than support Salisbury.

We mustered 30. Mght. have bn. worse.

[Exit W.W.

2. Currency Situation in Berlin.

E.B. Purpose of this memo. is only to get plan ready.

When first came up favoured D – to avoid provoking R. Now they have split Berlin, we shd. prefer a tidier scheme.

Told Cadogan to see N. Robertson to say we were forced into this unless 6 likely produce acceptable. scheme. He thought precipitate action wd. have unfav. effect on Sec. Council. We have therefore held back.

But U.S. want to announce early – even tho’ scheme not complete. Believe we cd. wait until N. Year. Cttee of 6 to report by 31/12

Divergence not too wide now. Tass report a scheme we cd. have accepted in Berlin discns.

Seems to be some will to settle.

R. wdn’t hesitate to put our stooge Magistrate if they got settlemt. of this.

Still playing therefore for time.

French are also inclined to be cautious.

No action at this stage except indicate to 6 this sitn. is arising and hope they will report by 31/12.

R.S.C. Germans likely to support D. If they do Genl. Robertson cd. get U.S. to accept it.

We wd. prefer D. But are content to leave it to Mil. Govrs. to settle.

P.M. U.S. are pressing us to (Tel. 727) make immed. statement to 6.

E.B. Can’t be rushed. Must consult Berlin people.

R.S.C. Will take 3 wks. to settle betwn. C. &amp; D. : make prepns.

C.J. Will Fr. agree with our line?

334

E.B. Yes. It’s U.S. who will make diffies. They want to burn boats.

Agreed.

3. India : Kashmir.

P.M. Situation looks v. grave. Liaquat telegram – if Indians continue pressing they must actively resist.

Bellicose Indian speeches. Claim they are recovering ground lost in early Pak. attacks.

A.V.A. Diffy. to establish true intentions of India.

Change of command in Indian Army not helpful – new man is vainglorious and difficult. Nye won’t have so much influence.

A. Independent arbitrator?

P.M. Delayed by illness of Marshall.

M’while may have a flare-up. And R. may intervene.

E.B. Thro’ Afghanistan prs. – not directly thro’ Pakistan.

Signs of R. coquetting with Afghans.

If war started Afghan raiders might get R. support, and beginnings of civil war as in China. Gt. temptn. to Afghans.

Nothing I can do at this stage. [Enter Service Ministers

P.M. Nor I - w’out being thought to be supporting one side or another.

E.B. Administrator of plebiscite – doubt if U.S. Govt. will allow chosen man to act. Won’t want to burn their fingers.

4. Naval Exercises in Mediterranean.

E.B. Heard Home and Med. Fleets mtg 7-9 March at Gib. for exercises. Wanted U.S. ships to join them – now in Med – for joint exercises.

Routine exercises now. But Gib. exercises wd. be on danger scale.

Asked if I see any pol. objns. I see none.

H. Amplified. Suggn. only. Hasn’t yet bn. broached with U.S. Admiral.

P.M. What of bringing some Fr. ships in also?

No pol. objn.

A.V.A. Wd. like to discuss with C.O.S.

Might set awkward precedent.

P.M. V. well. Discuss with C.O.S. and bring it up again.

335

5. Armed Forces : Pay of Women’s Services.

A.V.A. Cost - £900.000 at present. For target strengths £1.300.000.

This = pay at 4/5ths W’out terminal pensions and payments.

R.S.C. Total: £1.500.000 at present. “ £2.500.000.

A.V.A. Diff. to estimate that figure.

Women’s Services now fully integrated and permanent. They will want treatment comparable eg. with Civil Service (4/5th).

At last review cdn’t agree on fixed ratio. Ought to now.

Glad tht. R.S.C. isn’t so firm on original line against fixed ratio. Terminals : won’t arise for 10 years : don’t know wastage rate : but illogical not to apply same fixed ratio principle to pensions as to pay. For men, pension is related to pay whatever his family commitments.

P.M. Top of p. 2 – (4). Why does 4/5ths (1 not 2/3rds) imply same work?

R.S.C. Because 4/5ths throughout Govt. Service implies equal work. And then equal pay cd. not be resisted later.

There is diffce. betwn. men and women in Services because no use of lethal weapon. R. Commn. on Equal Pay made that point.

When equal pay has to be conceded, hope there will still be differential.

Compare war-time women’s pay with present proposals. See how large the increases wd. be (4th column) esp. in higher ranks. And pensions

[Enter N.B.

also. Tremendous increase. Much bigger than anyone has had.

Repercussions on nurses. Not as highly trained. Nurses in Forces will be much lower paid. Wd. demand increase – wd. have to be conceded. Then wd. have to grant it to civilian nurses.

And so on.

Spectacular increases will attract attention.

P.M. Why do you swap over arguments. Use of weapons at lower levels. Responsibility at higher levels.

R.S.C. I wd. have preferred special scale.

I am illustratg. now objns. to fixed ratio – in reln. to higher ranks.

Pensions – new idea. 4/5th of men. Men’s pensions are based on pay includg. marriage allowances – and reflect family commitmts.

Col. may retire at 45 with pension of £600. A woman wd. get £500. Cd. you justify that? Can’t have family responsibilities.

A pension system must be related to realities, not merely taken at 4/5ths of men.

A.B. Nonsense anyway to pension people at 45 at £600.

R.S.C. Even if you adopt 4/5ths for pay, it shd. be no more than 2/3rds 3/4ths for pension. Of 2/3rds for pay and ½ for pension.

336

Sums wd. come out of Def. Estimates.

2/3rds cost of £½ m. and £1 m. (on target strengths).

H.D. V. small nos. of high ranking officers : and to meet their case you create all these repercussions.

A.B. Any evidence tht. recruitment is hampered by low pay?

R.S.C. No. But agree they must have some pay increases.

A.V.A. They are v. far below target – in A.T.S. anyway, and W.A.A.F.

R.S.C. But no evidence tht. my proposals wdn’t be enough on that point.

P.M. Comparability of work?

A.H. 70/80% of R.A.F. are tradesmen in uniform.

Since R. Commn. on Equal Pay we are workg. on complete interchangeability on a 1/1 basis. Diff. therefore to resist fixed ratio. at something like 4/5ths.

Size of increase. No more than on new Pay Code 1946. W. Commr. then rose by £250 and Grp. Capt. by more.

H. In R.N. no sea service. Some ground work for Air Arm. But most are clerical, cooks or stewards.

G.A.I. Reaction on industry. 3/5ths now on average (10%). The unions will press for 4/5ths. At same time will be criticised by Equal Pay.

Much bigger increase than that obtained by women in industry. Reaction on White Paper.

Prefer increase by amounts rather than fixed ratio.

R.S.C. 4/5ths ratio in C. Service doesn’t apply to industrials. And much work in women’s service as comparable to industry rather than adminn.

A.B. Repercussions haven’t bn. discussed with all Dpts. affected.

There really must be machinery for that : w’in public sector, and effect on general economy.

Cabinet can’t consider these ques.

A.V.A. Can’t continue to resist pressure. For 2 yrs. this has bn. dragging on merely because of diffies. of just these repercussions.

P.M. What is the case as between 2/3rds and 4/5ths?

E.Sh. 2/3rds wdn’t give enough – in lower commd. ranks wd. involve some reduction.

337

Comparability. Gt. bulk of A.T.S. on clerical work : but side by side with male clericals – prob. more efficient than men! Cooks are prob. better than men. Why shd. they get only 2/3rds of men’s pay.

Steep increase for colonels but only 2 of them.

E.B. Taking allowces. in kind 2/3rds wd. give only £3 a week. Not v . high.

N.B. Paras 3-4 of A.V.A.’s memo.

Services aren’t getting recruits.

They are giving good value.

R.S.C. Pensions wd. be a draw. How much pay increase as well?

J. Can’t assume comparability. eg. no sea service in W.R.N.S.

A.V.A. Police : ratio is 10/11ths.

H.M. Drifting into trouble over Equal Pay.

We accepted the principle on the basis – not now, but some day.

Some day is coming. Here is a bit of it today.

On this – all agree some increase shd. be made. But fixed ratio is troublesome well below Brigadier – even Captains and W.O.’s wd. get big increases. Their responsibilities are not as great.

A.V.A. They are much greater.

H.M. Only in adminve jobs.

A.W. Can’t we have special scale? Family commitments of men.

R.S.C. Think special scale wd. be better theoretically. Agree, however, that they must have fixed rate. because of emotion aroused on this.

Believe 4/5ths wd. cause trouble in repercussions.

Wd. take ¾.

P.M. Cd. you announce as amounts, tho’ fixed on ¾ ratio.

R.S.C. Wd. then lose the psychological benefit of now having the “Cripps” scale.

E.Sh. The women will know quick enough it’s ¾.

P.M. Then what about 3/4ths?

A.V.A. Criticism from women in Labour Party. But we must face that.

Agreed : at 3/4ths ratio to men.

R.S.C. Pensions. Women will be v. well off and will [Exit Service

provoke demand for increases for men. Ministers.

338

Exit E.B.

Favour therefore not more than 2/3rds. ratio for pensions. Agreed.

G.T. Favour 50% rather than 2/3rds.

Agreed. Pay at 3/4ths of men.

Pensions at 2/3rds.

6. Economic Affairs.

R.S.C. Charts. Shall I send them round at intervals?

Innovn. welcomed.

R.S.C. Meat fr. Argentine : not being shipped under contract.

J.S. Not much over 10.000 t. a month vice 40.000 t. to fulfil agreemt.

Wd. now have to ship 50/60.000 to overtake arrears.

Choice : a) early repns. v. breach of Andes agreement the ???? to default on our side.

b) wait for negotiations.

I favour a) : tho’ it involves risk of break and sharp cut in ration.

Not yet ready to say what cards we have.

R.S.C. We haven’t any. Stock of meat was to have bn. our bargaining counter. That, doubtless, is why he is cutting deliveries.

H.W. He has swindled all thro’. I favour early repns.

R.S.C. We cd. say we cdn’t discuss long term contract at all while this default continues. He wants such a contract.

H.W. We cd. look at our exports. Might suspend some. Quick review.

J.S. Trying to get all our contract maize to us quick because price is above world price. Cd. we say we won’t go on taking that?

R.S.C. A rough house with him : but quick.

A.B. Threaten him with publicity, as a swindler. [Exit H.M.

H.W. Argentine desire to pose as 1st class nation.

Cd. we tell Peron tht. Miranda is letting him down?

And we shall tell the world.

Then others won’t do business with them.

R.S.C. Best approach is from E.B. to Bramnglia.

G.A.I. Publicity anyway before we cut meat ration.

339

Agreed : E.B. to send such a message as at x/.

B/T. and M/F. to work out at once what breaches

can be alleged v. them and what pressures we can

apply.

Production.

R.S.C. How is open-cast going?

H.G. Delayed for machinery to settle access to land. Must get quicker action.

T.W. Awkward for farmers.

C.E. Deep mined coal : cd. we get more if better feeling among men?

Is there slower working for political motives?

In view of what we said 2 yrs ago. it’s diff. to justify present rate of output.

H.G. Comm. leaders have bn. careful not to discourage prodn. But our people believe it’s going on at lower levels.

But not so much a factor as absenteeism. for sickness – since introdn. of higher benefits under N.H. Service. O.m.s. [sic] satisfy. but offset by that.

Agreed M/L. and M/N.I. to initiate a study of this ques. in relation to all industries.

A.B. Housing.

P. 3. 19.701 houses completed in October. Mis-stated in report.

External Trade.

H.W. Nov. in value highest ever. In volume 150% over ’38 = target.

5% higher than July record in terms of output p. working day.

Indicates export is not tailing off.

R.S.C. But tendency to sell more to soft than hard. No inroad on dollar deficit. Also spect. diffy. over gold paymts. for Belgium and Switzerland. May have to pay £39½ m. in gold to Belgium in 1949.

Open market in Belgium, but we can’t sell there.

A. More to Canada?

H.W. Engineering mission reports tht. those might be doubled.

340

Balance of Payments.

R.S.C. Nov : large deficit (46 cpd 22 m). Due to a) India’s heavy drawings. b) Heavy imports to U.K. Latter seasonal.

Total dollar expend. this quarter is below p’mme so far. Para 24, if realised, means we shall turn out lower.

Total gold and dollar deficit is running below p’mme – on wh. we forecast claims to E.R.P. 4 m. less in 1st 8 wks : and 93 m. less in prev. quarter.

Still havg. to sell gold because delays in E.R.P. paymts.

Terms/trade : slipped back v. us. Because higher prices under new contracts. Looks like tendency to decrease in some important world prices. Truman may try to bring some down. Harriman wants us to reduce export price of coal. Retail prices won’t fall much.

Wages.

Engineering repercussions have now worked themselves out.

Now in a stage of apprehension.

Transport and agriculture. Hope a negative result will be achieved on the latter.

G.A.I. N.U.R. reached agreemt. earlier in 1948. Urge new claim to part of that. Rlways made interim offer of 2/= all round. Others accepted. Figgins wouldn’t : has so informed us. We have replied : is he asking us to refer to Tribunal as interpretn. of Agreemt. or breach. If he agrees with former may get it to Industrial Ct. vice Arbitn. Tribunal.

Relaxation of Controls.

R.S.C. Will Dpts. responsible notify me of controls relaxed so that I may include a para. on this in my next Rpt?

Balance of Payments (cont’d).

H.W. The nearer we get to a total balance, the more countries grow “hard”. Must therefore be v. large favourable balances somewhere. Can Ty. let me know where, so we may guide exports away from those countries.

R.S.C. Yes – at end/quarter.

But clear we are tending to send to v. soft countries, unrequited, and less to hard countries. Believe this is part of change-over from sellers to buyers market?

H.W. Ty., last time we enquired, said no need to divert exports.

Believe it may be diff. now.

341

R.S.C. O.E.E.C. and Eur. Paymts. Agreemt. has effect tht. we can’t w’draw fr. some of the places fr. which we shd. otherwise like to w’draw.

A.B. Trouble fr. bilateral rigidity.

H.W. O.E.E.C. is leading to more unrequited exports.

A.B. May have to switch creditors.

C.J. Diffies. with Switz – due to tourists?

R.S.C. Yes : shall have to re-negotiate and reduce tourism.

Must remove m.f.n. resln. on tourist allowces.
