C.M. 14 (48) 16th February, 1948

1. Germany.

E.B. Germans talks in Ldn. p’poned. for a week because inability of U.S. team to attend, delayed by Congress Cttee.

2. Argentine: Trade Agreement.

[Enter J.S.

R.S.C. Agreement reached ad referendum. Want quick approval. Announce to-day.

Read terms of announcement.

Diff. to arrange. Argentine short of sterling because £150m for rlways.

Must give them £110m. Doing it by pre-payment for food supplies.

Tel. 255.

P.M. A word of praise for Amb. &amp; Mission.

R.S.C. Agreed.

[Enter B., H.G., G.S.

3. Dollar Position in 1948.

R.S.C. Mentioned P.M.’s note – food recommns now agreed.

Posn worse than expected in autumn.

Figures for Jan. worse even than this memo. But unlikely to continue at this rate: for e.g. Egypt drawn all dollar ration: hope of control over India: Argentine now better than might have been.

Main continuing trouble: Belgium because calling on gold guarantee.

Taking this up with them now. Shd. be able to balance over year, under new agreemt., but early drain on gold is serious.

&apos; This = warning tht. even this revised estimate may be exceeded.

Terms of trade = main diffy. If as 1938 wd. save 300m dollars on present figures.

Recommns as in para. 40 – corrected re food, by P.M.’s memo.

P.M. Effect of break in U.S. grain prices?

R.S.C. Likely to lead to general fall, but not collapse, in U.S. prices.

Forward prices for wheat are even lower. Reflects assumption of better harvests &amp; lower demand. Wheat Agreement, if reached, wd. give us benefit of lower world price even for wheat contracted at higher price (from Australia in particular).

J.S. Will be diff. to decide whr. to adopt Agreemt.

R.S.C. At reasonable price, wd. pay us to get the stability.

71

Tho’ it won’t help us in dollars.

A.B. Cotton prices will help us in dollars.

R.S.C. Wd. help us in negotiating a (new) price with e.g. Russia.

H.W. This memo. is only insurance pending discns on M. Aid.

If we don’t get that, we’ll have to do much more.

A.B. Procedure: do other than food recommns stand?

R.S.C. Yes: save timber. Where I intend to reduce imports, w’out cutting into housing p’mme.

T.W. Wheat (Canada). No objn to enquiry. But R. grain + 400.000 fr. Argentine were requd to m’tain existg. ration to ’49. If we had to use more coarse grains, we shd. have little margin for increase fr. May. Wd. need about 400.000 t to make an increase. Having 2m tons fr. R. &amp; Arg. diff. to explain why we cd. make no increase.

Thus, if we have to forfeit 400.000 t. from Can. for dollars, can we see whr. 400.000 t. of wheat can be secured from Russia.

Unless some increase soon in feed, no more G/eggs till ’50.

H.W. Diffy. = timing. Now seems we cd. increase feed rations.

Desirable for dollar saving in 49/50. We seem to have enough in sight: &amp; haven’t entered next year’s negotns.

If we do, however, we shall in autumn be in posn tht. we shan’t know if we can carry it through.

R.S.C. Expld diffy. of Canadian situation. Proposal is merely to explore possibility. Canada less likely to want to sell wheat elsewhere now world price has fallen. But enquiry still just worth having.

J.S. No action until Canadian posn known.

No early promise to give a level of feed ration wh. wd. involve cutting bread ration.

T.W. Will delay announcement as long as possible.

G.S. Announcemt. of any cuts shd. be made with inter-depl. agreemt.

Agreed: Will be “agreed” with Dpts. on wording of Economic Survey.

Oil

R.S.C. Until we meet Chairman, diff to say what can be done.

A.B. £421/2 – 50m. of dollars going in sales to soft-currency countries.

Italy defeated nation, converted by U.S. into hard currency country.

72

R.S.C. £154m spent on oil: divided as shown on p. 13.

Table II c.i.f. sales (our tankers) f.o.b. (their tankers).

f.o.b. sales may cost us nothg. for alternative = pump it back.

C.i.f. sales cost us tankers &amp; freights.

France metropolitan mainly f.o.b. Basis of much Fr. industry.

If we cut it off, it might be disadvantageous to us.

Denmark: part of bi-lateral deal.

Egypt: part of special deal.

Greece: political.

Italy: return for our purchase.

A.B. Means we are paying dollars for Italian goods.

R.S.C. Norway: tanker fleet depends on it.

If we insist on dollar invoicing it may be boomerang on us.

All these things must be taken into a/c – objective cut down supplies or make them pay for some by dollars.

A.B. This has bn. going on for 2 years. Scandalous. E.g. Greece = why shdn’t U.S. supply it. For oil is now equivalent to dollars. P.6. para. 28 – dollar cost of oil.

E.B. Only cost of equipmt. &amp; tankers – not permanently from U.S.

H.G. Release of tankers &amp; oil fr. Greece wdn’t give much because that is such a short haul.

A.B. It wd. be something.

Running deficit on oil for 2 years. Spending Dpts. have yielded.

Caused sacrifices. Borrowing money from U.S. to put “dollar” oil into soft currency countries for political reasons.

E.B. F.O. have never pressed for continuing supply on pol. grounds.

R.S.C. Memo. says no more than tht. there are pol. consns to be taken into a/c.

E.B. This oil is not in B. territory. Remember that.

Pol. trouble in Persia because we aren’t taking enough oil out.

H.G. Only approach is by examining each soft-currency country one by one – see what diversion is practicable. Diffies will then appear – part tankers (short hands etc.) = pledges in bi-lateral deals = semi-political (cf. U.S. reaction if we cut off supplies to France).

Can’t generalise about this.

E.B. M/L. assume ¾ m. emplt. in U.K. from oil business if M/E and Med. countries stabilised. Don’t throw that advant. away.

A.W. Will M. Aid enable other Europ. countries to buy dollar oil?

73

A. First step is discns with oil cos.

Told tanker posn will be easier?

B. Every prospect of addl. U.S. tanker tonnage from Mar. onwds.

Exports to Canada

H.M. 44m in ’47. Estimate for ’48 only 70 m. This sh. be our best market because Can. diffies with imports from U.S.A. Cdn’t we do better?

R.S.C. They won’t depart fr. non discussns. And many goods fr. U.S. are naturally cheaper because so close.

H.W. May do better esp. in textiles.

P.M. Books?

H.W. We are cutting home market to increase exports to N. America esp. in text books.

Non-discrimn Cars. Cd. sell 20m: but quote only 5m. for fear of offending U.S.

Whisky. Can sell more &amp; are discussing with M/F.

Engineering. M/S. memo. to O.N.C. shows big increase &amp; change in pattern. Getting into Canada on heavy equipment.

Will send E.B. a note on exploiting western areas of U.S.A.

A.W. Freights. Shd. there be control?

H.W. V. light. B. has arranged lower rate for cars.

Our prices generally in Canada are much higher than U.S.A.

A.B. Long-term risk to primary producers in W. Hemisphere.

P.M. U.S. forcing goods on Canada &amp; U.K. for wh. they can’t pay.

What’s use of that?

R.S.C. None: but they don’t understand it.

H.W. Diffy. = miscellaneous character of our exports &amp; so much = things wh. people in b/p. diffies won’t take.

A.B. Why don’t we mobilise the Praire Libby (eg. thro’ Gardiner) to press Canadian Govt.?

R.S.C. V. tricky.

[Exit J.S., H.G., G.S., B.

74

4. House of Lords Reform

H.M. Parly. Labour Party informed &amp; content about discns procdg.

Letter, however, fr. Liaison Cttee fr. J. Lee (9/2). Read it.

Followed up by article in Tribune.

Puts 3 points of principle wh. shd. be discussed at Labour Party. I’m asked for specific replies.

Read reply sent after consultg. P.M. and L.P.S.

Willing to discuss the 3 points w’out prejudice to pending discns – but don’t want to re-open it at this stage.

Cab. shd. know of this. Shdn’t re-open at this stage.

Limits to discns set in L.P.S. statement in H/L.

P.M. All discns are ad referendum.

Party amply safeguarded.
