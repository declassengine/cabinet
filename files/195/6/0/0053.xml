C.M. 68(48) 4th November 1948

1. Parliament. [Enter W.W. and W.P.

P.M. Congrats. to all on Debate on Address.

H.M. Business for next week.

P.M. W.S.C. was wishing to ask P.N. Ques re S. Sessions. Dissuaded him on promise to discuss. Awkw. moment : also Comms. are now v. war. But little has leaked from S. Sessions. I’m not keen on resuming them. We shd. think it over.

2. Wireless Telegraphy Bill.

P.M. Right of entry provn. will cause gt. trouble.

P.M.G. Bill a) makes permanent legn. wh. has bn. in force since 1904.

Appliances for domestic use, medical, and industrial 40.000 complts. p.a. re dom. interference. We now try to deal with it by asking permn to inspect, and advise how to put things right.

P.M. Advice often involves cost?

P.M.G. Yes : a suppressor. But sometimes we can’t enter or can’t get advice accepted.

P.M.G. More important source – radar and landing beams in airports.

Diathermy in hospitals and industrial plant may interfere with airport radar control. Want powers because of that also. That will be larger problem.

P.M. Better to require suppressors to be attd. before sale.

Steam-hammer for nut.

H.D. V. ill advised politics esp. in latter years of a Parliament.

What sanctions?

P.M.G. No offence until a no. of things have gone on.

A.B. Short wave : little used in private houses. You cd. stop most at source by modifn. of equipment before sale. Wd. take time to work it thro; Interfce. due to ill repair cd. be handled by repair at P.O. cost.

P.M. What happens in eg. U.S. and Sweden where so much electricity used? When we switched over to a.c. State paid.

R.S.C. Extension of old law of nuisance, to neighbours.

278

J. But compulsory entry introduces a new element.

H.M. Magistrate’s Order : notice in advance. Cl. 14. This came to H.F.C.

P.O. will administer carefully. Appliances not in ample supply.

Ques. : shd we go to 2nd Rdg. and consider amendmts. before Cttee?

P.M. You won’t get away with promise to be careful in adminn.

E.B. Can’t you get at this thro’ servicing visits. Public needn’t pay.

Don’t like idea of climbing down publicly over this because of air accidents.

A. Limit it to diathermy and industrial, wh. is what interferes with radar.

N.B. If State cd. pay, we wd. be able to tackle this thro’ servicing and advice.

Not enough to leave it to manufrs.

R.S.C. a) Compel manufrs. to fit. b) Limit entry to large user and exempt private premises. Tho’ it wd. have to cover diathermy even in private houses. Offer to limit it to that.

H.M. Why not tell Parlt. there is a dilemma here. For there is the interest of the listener to be taken into a/c.

A.W. Right of entry for water leakage etc.,

A.B. Yes, since Disraeli’s day.

P.M. In any event I’m inclined to think alterations etc. shd. not be at expense of user.

H.D. So am I.

Agreed : proceed with 2nd Rdg. on above basis.

[Exit W.W. and W.P.

3. North Atlantic Treaty and Western Union.

E.B. Para.14 a) N. Atlantic Treaty.

Important not to include econ. and social aspects. Don’t want defence linked in U.S. with E.R.P. Canada suggested this, for presentn. presumably. but I think it wd. be unwise.

Sweden etc., may be better to have Scandin. arrangemt. rather than bring them in to this. But we can’t settle that : must come after discn. in W’ton.

279

Italy : Def. equipment limited : don’t want to diffuse it : Italy might become liability.

Reg. Pact under Art. 51. But allows for area, wh. has always had to operate together, to get co-operative effort working. Foundn. for world wide agreement.

N.B. Pearson – long talk : didn’t mention econ. and social. Will agree with E.B. He did however want Ministerial mtg. to be held until offl. talks have shown Treaty will be signed.

E.B. That’s what I intend.

N.B. Eire, if invited, will raise Partition at once. Makes a diffy.

A.B. 14(c) Portugal.

E.B. Vital because of Azores. And defensive agreemts. with U.K. and U.S. already. S. Atl. otherwise open to subs.

A.B. But not a democratic partner in W. Union. Short step to Spain. And then idealistic basis of W. Union is lost.

E.B. Oldest ally. Brought in over Africa. Worked in with them in the war.

P.M. Diffce. betwn. Salazar and Franco.

A.B. Mainly because he didn’t have to fight for his power.

E.B. If R. wd. enter world settlemt. I wdn’t sneeze at their system.

A. Para.14(b). And on next page refce. to supplies. Will they be Land Lease: will they interfere with E.R.P.? We want assurance in advance tht. they won’t pro tanto diminish E.R.P.

E.B. I’ve insisted throughout on separation from E.R.P. But I can’t guarantee eventual decn. of U.S. Congress.

A.B. Need we have Portugal?

H.M. Must be realistic about this.

P.M. This is under U.N. which includes all sorts.

A.B. Portugal is de minimis : included in O.E.C.C. on λάυθανιeν [sic] basis.

Even France hasn’t found it necessary to take the point publicly, as they did over Spain.

N.B. Eire less important if Portugal and Iceland are in. Leave them out?

280

E.B. No : if they seek to raise Partition, I can say I won’t discuss it. Doesn’t worry me.

Cdn’t offer to Iceland and not to Eire. That wd. be wrong.

A.B. Cd. F.O. give us a study on internal situation in Portugal. To give us material on wh. to meet criticisms. Agreed.

H.W. Denmark. Their P.M. spoke to me in Copenhagen, makg. clear their attitude viz., want Sweden in first. But if U.S. came in they wdn’t be so anxious to wait on Sweden moving first.

P.M. Finns hope Sweden will come in : then they can stay with the West.

E.B. Care not to guarantee anyone you can’t in the end protect.

U.S. are inclined to go too far.

Agreed.

b) Western Union.

E.B. Crucial point is – keep control in hands of Govts. Parly. Assembly, as Fr. wanted, wd. be responsible to none and embarrassing to all. Got them off that. They then countered with argument “France has bn. occupied : defeatist (tho’ they don’t say so in terms): can’t we do somethg. to raise morale? I came to concln. with no constitution – modelled on Comm. mtgs. (France in trouble enough with her own constitution.) Comm. relations wd. make more diff. our entry into formal constitn. arrangemts.

Against that, Comm. – organised and disciplined. We don’t want that.

Schumann said he wd. have to bring in Parliamentarians. And he has done, from todays’ Press. But it’s all Parties supportg. his present Govt.

Plan : meet to consider and report to Govts. – on form and scope. If we do nothing, supporters of W. Union will feel let down.

Scope. O.E.E.C. takes 19 countries on same basis of comm. interest.

Scandinavia won’t come into this. But shd. Italy. Switz. etc., not for defence (Brussels Powers) but qua common interest.

Hostility betwn. G. and Fr. Can’t recover w’out getting rid of that.

Schumann has bn. moving in that direction more than Bidault, who had de Gaulle in his mind and tended twds. a Clemenceau attitude.

N.B. Endorsed.

Need for somethg. to strike imagination. Alternative to Federal ideas is essential. Govts. Not Parly. Assembly.

This is how Comm. grew. as a matter of history.

Scope : much to be said for going beyond Brussels Powers.

P.M. Essentials. a) Governmental repves. only. Keep out W.S.C.

b) No elaborate constitution : no Parly. Assembly.

281

We must canalise “Federal” enthusiasm into sensible channels.

R.S.C. Worried only by w. party. French group of Parliamentarians.

Belgians similarly, are not Gov. repves. They will leak bright ideas and we shall be blamed for stopping it.

Shd. report unanimously not by majority.

Warn others not to follow French model in choosing repves.

P.M. Fr. team are all ex. P.M.’s. Wrong basis.

H.D. These suggns. are on same lines as Labour Party “Feet on the Ground”.

This proves E.B. is right. (!)

Parly. Assembly is nonsense : turn its flank by better positive proposal.

A. How do paras. 28 and 29 work?

A.B. agreed on presentn.

Council of Ministers are to appoint a Secretariat. para. 23(b).

E.B. Para. 23 was proposal I put in Paris : only one of the plans to be considered under w. party examn.

N.B. Doms to be kept informed.

Substance of memo. approved.

[Enter H.G.

4. Off Shore Oil in Persian Gulf.

E.B. See more diffies. over Persia. P.Q.’s in H/C. by fellow travellers.

Wd. like to discuss further with H.G.

Saw Persian P.M. y’day and got on well. Unwise to spring this on him so quickly.

R.S.C. Not “off shore”.

H.G. Cos. are pressing v. hard to get on with this. Cd. E.B. see U.S. To prevent U.S. cos. to get ahead of B. cos.

J. May F.O. consult me on some of these striking propns. on international law.

Memo. w’drawn. E.B. to consult H.G.

[Exit H.G.

282

5. Abolition of Visas for U.S. Citizens.

E.B. Has now bn. cleared with H.O.

Tho’ it can’t be reciprocal, it shd. be done. Hope delay for B. subjects will be reduced in consequence.

C.E. No objection. Wd. have preferred reciprocity. But advantages outweigh.

P.M. Criticism tht. we are yielding to U.S. pressure?

H.D. If we don’t, we shall be only tourist country keeping visa on.

H.W. All tourist people urge this. No protest even about petrol and clothing concessions to tourists.

A.B. Don’t favour unilateral concession.

Don’t believe visa does deter tourists.

Wd. never have agreed to this if Dewey had won.

6. Germany : Ownership of Coal, Iron and Steel Industry.

E.B. Trusteeship scheme for coal iron and steel indns. in Anglo-U.S. Zone of Germany

Agreement now reached declarg. not to revert to old owners and are to be disposed of by G. people. Trustee m’while. As U.S. have agreed to sign – and Fr. are only dissenters (because of internationalism and shares in Fr. pits), want authority to sign.

A.B. Shd. we not see this?

R.S.C. Valuable U.S. admn. Don’t risk it by delay.

A.B. Not enough to say “former owners” shd. prevent return to any private owners.

P.M. Went thro’ all that before.

Agreed : subject to any Minister notifying P.M. by 7 p.m. Thursday if they want mtg. Friday.

7. Labour Inspection in Industry : Commerce. Approved.
