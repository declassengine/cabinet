C.M. 53 (48) 22nd July, 1948

1. E.R.P. Terms of Loan.

[Enter W.W.

R.S.C. 300 m at 3%: no interest until after E.R.P.: no amortisation till ’46 &amp; then in 46 instalments. Waiver clause.

Reservn a) Can’t pay 3%. They are borrg. at 21/2%. Stick on that.

b) Amortisation. Alarmed at blocked a/c – might be £500m. Propose instead consultn if condn arise in wh. we can’t pay. &amp; suspend paymt. when we ask for consultn. Think we can get ???? anyway.

Agreed.

2. Parliament.

H.M. Business for next week.

3. Capital Punishment.

H.M. Silvermann asked y’day at Party Mtg. what our line wd. be. I had to say Cab. hadn’t decided. He then said, as we hadn’t discussed with Party, supporters must be free.

Averse from using Parlt. Act on so confused an issue.

A. Also wd. exclude the useful amendmts. made in H/L.

C.E. Intended to say this change in law can’t be made this Session.

Dropping this clause doesn’t mean abandoning the ques altogether.

Searchg. debates have prepd way. Hope Parlt. will consider as a separate issue in due course.

A.B. Political folly to allow this issue to run currently with use of Parlt. Act on Steel Bill. Wd. obscure the main issue.

Pass C.J. Bill w’out provn re cap. punishment. Consider wtr. we can deal with it separately &amp; not under Parlt. Act.

But don’t say publ. opinion is re abolition. because H/L.

H.D. Cd. we appoint Cttee (incldg. other Parties) to consider? Shd. not be handled on Party lines. Include e.g. Templewood &amp; a Bishop.

J. Support that. L.C.J. even said some amendmt. of law is required eg on constructive murder. Need some layers – v. complex issue.

Can’t defend this Clause. “It was a dreadful Clause when you came to examine it” (!)

258

H.M. Attractive: needs thought. Composn needs careful thought.

R.S.C. T &amp; r. Don’t throw up main issue. Will never get there.

P.M. Trouble will be (to-night) pressure for Parlt. Act procedure.

C.E. Those who have supported abolition for years (eg. Benson) have been loyal &amp; reasonable.

A.B. Cdn’t C.E. commit Govt. to exploring some acceptable compromise – w’out promising legn.

P.M. Let C.E. promise to explore, further, possibility of compromise – on basis revealed in both Houses.

H.M. W’out further commitmt. to legislate in this Parliament.

Agreed: P.M. to see draft.

4. British Nationality Bill.

A. Salisbury wants an excuse to w’draw from his opposition.

Can be assured tht. views expressed in both Houses will be examd at October mtgs. with P.M.’s.

N.B. No harm in that. Tho’ we’ve said it was discussed at D.P.M. in 1946 &amp; offl. conference later. Better to finish one mtg’s conclns before beginning another.

J. H.O. have suggd vaguer formula – discussions at future Conferences.

Hope we can refer to Dec. mtg.

P.M. Related subjects will be under discn &amp; this can arise.

E.B. “Bill &amp; its implicns will be available for discn if desired”

H.M. We can shall [sic] report to Confce on Bill etc., - &amp; there will be opportunity for discn.

E.B. Say, “ the debates etc. have bn. reported to Comm. Govts. and those reports will be available for discn if desired by any Comm Govt.”

Make it clear to Tories that we can’t dictate the Agenda.

R.S.C. After – kept informed. In acc. with practice matter not discussed.

259

5. Rhodesia: Amalgamation of the Rhodesias.

C.J. Elibank has agreed to drop his Motion after discn with me. Will try to enlighten him before autumn.

6. Germany. }

} Not heard

7. Middle East. }

8. Antarctic.

[Enter C.O.S, Hall, J.S.

E.B. As in memo.

Not same insistence now on strategic side of ques. Feel it’s better to go for a Conference.

Argentine claim to Falkland Islands will be resisted.

But F. Islands Dependencies cd. go under Con-Dominium.

Ask for approval of para. 7.

C.A.S. F. Islands are essential.

On Dependencies – not essential, tho’ desirable, we shd. m’tain our posn. Wanted full survey: haven’t bn. able to do that. But premlimy enquiries satisfied us now tht. no practical possibility of m’taining active mil. base there. Want met. informn from that area however.

N.B. Support F.O. Sorry we had no chance to inform Dom’ before U.S. told Argentine &amp; Chile. Interest of S. Africa (whaling) A &amp; N.Z. Only A. likely to be diff. Shd. be able to square Evatt. We shd. also inform Canada because repercussions on Arctic.

Condominium shd. meet our met. needs.

P.M. Cdn’t Chile &amp; Argentine go into (?) vacant lot.

N.B. Believe its Norwegian.

J. Cd. it be made a condn tht. they abandon their claim to Falkland Islands. Avoid impn of weakness. Cd. go to Court if desired.

R.S.C. That wd. mean bringing Falklands into this bargain.

Better to go on refusing to entertain any claim to Falklands.

J.S. Whaling at Deceptn Island. Can lease be granted before talks begin?

A.V.A. Will this act precedent for all our possessions in W. Hemisphere.

E.g. B. Honduras, who want a conference rather than refce to Internatl Court.

E.B. What wd. you do?

260

A.V.A. You have offered the Internatl Court. What then?

E.B. Means fighting. Are you ready for that.

P.M. Distinguish between these icebergs &amp; settled territories.

A.B. Posn is tht. 2 countries have refused offer of arbitn by Intern. Ct. Shd. we not go to U.N. Russia will be affronted by this plan for international co-ercion.

N.B. Doesn’t compromise our posn. Trusteeship idea of U.S. wasn’t made public. Condominium won’t seem odd for uninhabited country.

A.B. W’draw if original U.S. idea of Trusteeship hasn’t been made public.

A.V.A. I don’t w’draw my views.

J. I don’t like it either.

P.M. Then do you want to send R.N. to remove settlers?

E.B. And U.S. are going to propose this. What do we say?

Why does A.V.A. dislike welcoming U.S. into Antarctic when we welcome them into Europe?

A.V.A. Don’t concede the principle you want to uphold in respect of Falklands.

P.M. Not the same thing.

J. So long as A., N.Z., S. Africa are bought in….

R.S.C. Only prestige point: had gt. diffy. in persuading Doms. to send a ship.

N.B. Better service from a Condominium.

C.J. Insecurity in F. Islands because pol. ambitions in Arg. and Chile.

A more (in disn of memo) will re-assure them.

Agreed: ascertain views of A., N.Z., S. Africa &amp; Canada and go ahead with this plan if they agree.

If they don’t agree, Cabinet must consider again.

A.V.A. May results of this consultn be reported to Cab?

P.M. Whaling lease: F.O., C.O. and M/F. to consult.

14. Economic Affairs.

R.S.C Wages.
