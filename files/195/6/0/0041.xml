No troops to work Wed. until we see wtr. the men go back.

P.M. Royal Message will be introduced this p.m.

Must go fwd. with Regs.

E.B. Employers weren’t ready (Tooley St.) to demand work this a.m.

They weren’t tipped off, tht. P.M. was b’casting.

N.Ed. We told Dock Labour Corpn.

E.B. Then they aren’t good enough. Will discuss with M/L. and M/T.

There must be somethg. wrong here. Agreed.

Management must be at fault.

P.M. I have a report from a firm which supports that view.

E.B. Lpl. and Ldn. are mainly at fault.

J. Post mortem into strikes?

E.B. Too legalistic. Informal talk with Unions &amp; managemt. is better.

No formal report. Continuing interest is what’s required.

A.B. Find out why some ports (e.g. S. Wales) are unaffected.

Cd. Union tell us distn of disaffected elements? To forestall

Comm. efforts to supplement &amp; fill their gaps.

adding later.

P.M. Negative impn. Because positive powers under 51, 53 and 58 A of D.

Regs. already in force.

I gave impn in H/C. tht. we wanted Rgs. to do things.

Att.G. First gives positive powers. Remainder are negative. Because we

don’t want overlapping powers.

P.M. Wd it be said we were straining D.R. powers?

Att.G. No. Purposes extended in Supplies &amp; Services Act.

E.B. Don’t want to use Control/Engagemt. Order for this purpose.

Att.G. Can’t do that under 1920 Act because it prohibits indl. conscriptn.

E.B. Then P.M. must not say we already have powers to direct labour.

Need we promulgate any Regs.
