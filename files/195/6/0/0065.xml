C.M. 80(48) 13th December 1948

1. Argentine Meat.

E.B. Took this up – asked for no publicity m’while. Now, this a.m., all over the Press.

R.S.C. Will look into this point.

2. Indonesia.

E.B. Dutch For. Minister has bn. out. Heard Thurs. complete b’down was likely.

Telegraphed to Nehru and Holland. Drafted telegram to Chifley. Not sent (? any of them). Believed a chance of getting Republic in to Federal Govt. While I was labouring this, Dutch stabbed me in the back by issuing communiqué.

I laid off all my prepns. Thought Republic cdn’t be persuaded in teeth of that communiqué.

Dutch lines are being ???? – they will be forced to Police action soon.

Means civil war.

Means S.E. is becoming ripe plum for Russia.

Rubber, tin etc. are threatened – will ruin our b/paymts. thro’ loss of dollar earnings.

Our Amb. in Holland now says this mayn’t be last word – and suggests we make modified repns. to Republic. Similar message fr. Batavia.

Will therefore try to remedy situation.

Agreed : E.B. to make a last attempt.

3. China.

E.B. Clear tht. only country wh. cd. help China = U.S. And looks as tho’ U.S. have now written them off.

Little chance of Chang Kai surviving.

Will successor Govt. be Chinese Comm. or R. dominated? A fair chance that, outside Manchuko, they will be Chinese. Mustn’t therefore hang on so long to old tht. we lose chance of influencing the new. Our interests are v. large.

Effect on contiguous and neighbouring countries.

Diffy. of getting united front –

a) India/Pakistan troubles leave E. Parkistan open to Comm. influences from Burma. Can’t get them into conference on this ques.

b) Cdn’t get I./Pakistan to meet in conference with France because of Indo-China. Fr. Parties, due to diffies. in France, are unable to face

343

Indo-China problem. Think of sending Dening to Paris to see if we can get Fr. to come out with bold approach to Indo. China problem.

All I can do is to get Macdonald to see Powers in S.E.A. one at a time and urge measures of defence v. Comm. Get C.R.O. to approach I./Pak.

H.M. Pessimistic about R. influence in Asia.

In Asia R. has moved into tepid war.

Uncertainties of Fr., U.S. policy etc. mean tht. events move on to point at wh. nothg. can be done.

V. serious if this is beginning of R. dominn. of F/East and S.E.A.

Not only because of defence, but because of trade.

Hong Kong and Shanghai – may become another “Berlin”.

Shd. we not have organn. to ensure we aren’t out-manoeuvred by R. in F/East? As we have O.E.E.C. etc. for Europe.

A. and N.Z. vitally concerned.

Cd. we not get organn. with U.S., France, Holland, A. and N.Z. to review situation and hammer out a policy?

P.M. Trouble has bn. with narrow minded Colonial outlook of Dutch.

French much the same over Indo-China.

Diff. therefore to get them to march with A. and N.Z. – still more I./Pak.

Diff. constitutional issue raised now by India. Warning.

On genl. line of this memo. I agree – no alternative.

E.B. U.S. cut us out in F/East. Now are dropping it. Their mess.

A.V.A. No doubt tht. sitn. in Malaya and H. Kong will be directly affected.

Friendly relations with victorious Comms. may help us – wish I cd. be sure. Various indications of tie-up with Russia.

Chinese popn. in Malaya and H. Kong will become more diff.

Recommn. (ii). We have recent apprecn. by C’s-in-C. F/East: now under consn. by C.O.S. M’while, what to do over Shanghai.

Telegram fr. Naval C-in-C. : saying strong feeling aroused by announcement (F.O.) tht. we wd. not send any troops. His plans do provide for mil. support.

2 cruisers in China seas. 2 destroyers. 4 frigates. [Enter E.Sh.

1 Austr. cruiser.

2 battns. and F.A. regimt. + 5 flying boats in H. Kong. Considering fighter squadron or less fr. Philippines. Gurkha battn. sailing from Singapore.

A. For defence of B. lives and property only.

Discontent of Ch. peasant. But unlikely to adopt new faith.

Wd. accept protn. of anyone against robbery.

At Comm. mtg. Fraser was doubtful about Fr. or Dutch support. But wanted Comm. countries and U.S. to consult. And get U.S. to settle Japan. Much easier then to get common front v. Comm.

344

Press therefore for early action on Recommn. (i) confined to Comm. countries and U.S.A.

E.B. Don’t press U.S. too far lest they w’draw from Europe.

Gt. opportunity missed when I got Byrnes to agree to U.S. and Comm. countries on F/East under cover of talk about Pacific Islands.

But Evatt stabbed me in the back.

R.S.C. Kuomintang have driven all Third Force elements out.

Liberals will therefore collaborate with Comm.

Will prob. not be offensive to for. industrial interests in early stages.

Won’t be economically dominated by R.

Too big an area and too diff. a psychology for R. to intervene directly.

Agree therefore we must keep contact with these Comms. and prevent their getting close to Russia.

Immedte. situation. a) Encouraging B. interests to stay. Must be careful how we do that. Claims to compensn. Heavy ones already from Shanghai. Shd. prefer concln. : we shd. not discourage them fr. staying.

b) On Recommn. (i) I wd. not bring France and Netherlands in at present. (E.B. I agree : wd. see them separately – and ? later.)

C.J. Refugees to Hong Kong.

Can’t stop them coming in by sea.

If any I.R. Orgn. is to help, we shd. prefer they shd. do it outside H. Kong.

Many Comms. in H. Kong. Wd. be trouble with them.

R.S.C. We mustn’t appear by action in H. Kong to be associatg. ourselves with Kuomintang elements.

C.J. Risk of Comm. infiltration thro’ Siam to Malaya.

J. Need to get strong Govt. in Malaya and H. Kong.

May be some fortificn. will be necessary.

Hope no time will be lost.

C.J. Govts. cdn’t be stronger. C.O.S. have every confidence in Govrs.

A.V.A. Early consultn. with U.S. and Comm. countries re protn. of strategic interests.

R.S.C. But won’t do if U.S. try to go on supportg. Kuomintang. Mustn’t encourage them to that sort of line.

Don’t want Kuomintang to take refuge in Formosa under U.S. protn.

a Liberal Govt. there wd. be another matter.

What we want consult U.S. about is our concerted attitude twds. a Comm. Govt. in China when it emerges.

E.B. Agree. Will instruct Franks to approach them on this.

345

T.W. Local co-ordinator on Killearn model? Won’t it be wise to do that now – to co-ordinate prepns. of Govts.

E.B. Macdonald’s organn. in Singapore is effective enough.

May have to send someone out to handle refugee problem. My diffy. is that I can’t find good men. Might get Tucker out of I.R.O. or Jackson, now available from U.N. Will speak to E.E.B.

P.M. Close consultn. with Comm. countries.

R.S.C. Start with U.S.

H.D. Separate but simultaneous?

E.B. Propose approach U.S. first.

Recommn. i) U.S. first. }

ii) C.O., A.V.A and F.O. to consult } Agreed.

4. Acquisition of Land and Buildings by Govt. Depts.

[Enter Key and King

R.S.C. Made explanatory statement.

Complicn. of valuation function in view of T. and C. Planning Acts etc. Crown Lands have on this a/c asked D. Valuer to act for them – and that largely concerns agric. land.

Examples of diffies a) M/W. paid £1.500 – though D. Valuer had agreed it with owner at under £900.

b) M/W. bought at £150 p. acre. We had to acquire next site and bought at £90 because we knew fr. Death Duties tht. this was enough.

c) M/W. £145.000 existg. use. We got D. Valuer on to it and we put it at £80.000. Don’t know wthr. they succeeded in buying.

d) M/W. works distinguishg. between D. Valuer figure and figure at wh. they thought they cd. buy.

Raise v. grave ques. in keeping down values and restrictg. developmt. charges.

My plan wdn’t involve delay.

P.M. What of your work on rating and C. Land Bd. work.

R.S.C. Extra load = only 2% (presumably load of other Dpt. work).

We have to make valuation anyhow for developmt. charge. We shd. have to do it twice.

A.V.A. Must acquire large amount of land under W. Paper w’in small time.

King Manchr, Sheffield, Leeds and L.C.C. want to do own valuation. We want to get them in. Embarrassing if Dpts don’t come in.

T.W. Ty. case on urban valuatns.

346

Ag. + forestry. Ty. memo. doesn’t arise because based on C. &amp; B. grounds.

Argument doesn’t apply to rural land.

We have to keep prof. staff. To exclude them fr. acquisition wd. be waste of skill. Ty. case may be good in theory.

My officers have to supervise use of land and acquire as necessary to ensure good use. Specialised knowledge, not available to D. Valuers. Land Service, supervising estate management. Specially experienced in rural land, and forest land. Ty. have given carte blanche subject to limit of £5 p. acre. No complaints.

For cheap and easy acquisition rely on existg. service.

D. Valuers haven’t this experience of rural land.

Examples. a) Land requisitions and farmed by us for 7 years.

We can tell better than D. Valuers what we shd. pay for it.

b) Romney Marsh. Agric. Land Commn. asked to recommend. They wd. be best people to assess value of it.

We have power to put occupier under supervision. We therefore have the knowledge.

Univ. and Colleges wd. oppose any change of procedures. So, I believe, wd. local authies.

E.Sh. Ty. argument points to consultn. not absorption of function.

M./W. examples cd. be prevented by consultn.

No W.O. examples were quoted. Reason : we get a low price because familiar with procedure.

We have few developmt. value cases.

My genl. case is same as M/Ag. Staff of skilled valuers. If we cd. dispense with them then wd. be economy. But we can’t – for a) estate management. b) acquisn. of land overseas.

Delay. no doubt tht. new duties apart, D. Valuer wd. involve delay because he wd. have to consult W.O. corrce. will pass etc. Quicker if Dpt. continued to handle with consultns.

No assurance our work will get priority.

Sympathise with objectives i) co-ordinn. ii) avoid excessive prices. But this scheme isn’t necessary for either purpose.

Ty. say this addn. wd. be only 2%. of D. Valuer’s work. If so, leave it to those who can best handle it.

W.O. aftermath tasks. At least let us finish these.

Be content with consultn. which Dpts. have offered.

C.K. Favour arrangements for consultn.

Ministers asked officials to work out scheme of consultn. But Ty. won’t accept the scheme which was worked out.

My people cd. work on same principles as D. Valuers.

Unfair to put in terms of money totals : it’s no. of sites eg. G.P.O. requirement for large no. of small sites.

347

Delay : already had to wait 3 mos. and more for replies from D. Valuers.

Over centralisation is bound to delay acquisitions.

Wiser course : allow 2 years or so best of consultn. system.

King Support R.S.C.

Vital to us. Land Bd. seekg. to m’tain existg. use value. If anyone breaks that ring, lose whole Act and Fund of £300 m.

M/Ag. tht. rural land hasn’t developmt. value. In fact most land does and M/Ag. valuers haven’t realised it.

“Good will of owners” (M/W.) lets cat out of bag.

C.K. Not on price. Our Act assumed l.a.’s wd. work thro’ D. Valuers. They want that provn. removed. Can’t w’stand them if Dpts. contract out.

One wrong valuation will affect all land in one area.

H.M. One or two questions –

(a) Will this Ty. plan achieve staff reductions? Can Ty. estimate it?

R.S.C. Impossible to estimate. If estate managemt. is only function Dpts. shdn’t need so many men.

C.K. I am advised tht. we cdn’t dispense with any.

E.Sh. So am I.

R.S.C. There must be less work to be done.

H.M. (b) Is the 2% a figure of transactions or of values.

R.S.C. My calculn. based on values.

H.M. (c) Some Dpts. have used Valuers. What is their experience?

H.W. We use them : have no complaints : but volume of work with us is small.

When I was at M/W. I thought D. Valuers were empire building.

And don’t see how tht. work cd. be cut out of M/Works.

P.M. What of M/W. argument tht. negotns. shdn’t be interrupted.

R.S.C. Always is thus interrupted in private negotiations.

Valuation is a separate task. Main qualifn. is widest knowledge of values. And D. Valuers value all land in U.K. once in each genn. – for Death Duties.: and must be notified of all private sales.

Everyone agrees to consultn. But what does tht mean in practice?

Diffy. is, not in laying down principles, but in applying them.

The D. Valuer either doesn’t look at property or goes out and does his own valuation.

348

If second course, that valuation must be final.

E.Sh. Small independent Cttee. No hurry. We can’t be sure of facts.

T.W. Support that.

Don’t accept Ty. statements about superior competency of D. Valuers.

A. My sympathies are with Ty.

Estate managemt. has nothg. to do with this.

The best knowledge of values, urban or rural, is with D. Valuers.

Shd. be absorbed – with arrangemts. to avoid delay.

C.E. Support Ty. – for Dpt. and l.a. experience.

H.O. use D. Valuer for own work and for checking l.a. estimates.

Wd. like to know why M/Ag. says tht. Co. Councils wd. resent nos. of D. Valuers for small-holding purposes. V. Much doubt that. Co. Councils trust D. Valuer more than Agric. organns. which reflect views of land owners.

Need to ensure that no addl. sums be paid in view of the £300 m.

H.D. Support Ty. view.

G.T. I took M/W. view when I was there. But when T. &amp; C. Bill was going thro’ …. Fear bottlenecks. Cd. we be assured it won’t lead to that?

D.Valuer price must be ceiling.

P.M. Can we be assured there won’t be delay?

A.V.A. V. important tht. Service Dpts. shd. do all the prelimy. work and hand over to D.Valuer only at last stage.

R.S.C. Can’t allow Dpts. to do preliminary negotiations – or they will compromise price.

H.M. Want more informn.

a) Staff. If Ty. view accepted, we shd. insist on staff saving. If it were

establd. tht. there cd. be none, it wd. affect decision.

b) Any examples of Dpts. buying below D. Valuer’s figure?

c) Delay.

Cd. an official Cttee assemble these facts?

G.A.I. Supported H.M.’s proposal. H.W. and A.W. also supported it.

A.W. Ty. have made their case in principle.

P.M. Ty case establd. in principle = Officials to present facts :

a) How will it work w’out delay.

b) Any other examples con.

R.S.C. Different is what hurts, not higher or lower.

349

5. International Labour convention : Workmen’s Compensation.

G.A.I. Old Convn. wh. we cdn’t ratify before. Now we can.

C.J. Another – non metrop. countries – is now under discn. This shd. be related to that.

G.A.I. That will be ok. We ratify for U.K. only.
