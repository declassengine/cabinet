1948

C.M. 1(48). 6th January, 1948.

1. Defence Estimates. [Enter H., E.Sh., G.de Fr. &amp; Mayhew.

A.V.A. Summarised earlier discussions and contents of memo

Still a transitional year. Long-term policy now about to be

formulated.

This assumes liquidn of certain commitments. These may not all

be realised. Supplementaries may therefore be necessary.

A.B. App. 1. 375.000: shd. it be added to other figure?

A.V.A. Yes.

A.B. Will it remain constant throughout year?

A.V.A. Yes. But it is an absolute limit: won’t probably be reached.

Correspondg. figure wasn’t reached this year.

J. Are we spending enough on research?

A.W. Estimates for this haven’t bn. cut: indeed, increased.

A.V.A. We are being criticised for using too much scientific man-power on

defence research, as cpd. with civil.

R.S.C. This doesn’t include atomic research.

Limiting factor is skilled man-power. We cdn’t spend more.

A.B. Strengths are out of proportion to supporting industrial force.

H.M. Speeches to support Service morale: role of Services etc.

P.M. Nos. of civilians: need to be in a posn to defend this.

C.E. Comparative costs of a soldier now and in 1938. Cd. these be worked

out. 825.000 is mean strength thro’ year: &amp; cost £839 per man.

But much more at “bayonet strength”.

A.V.A. How do you estimate bayonet strength? Where do you count

mechanics in REME. and R.A.F.

C.E. How much is extra cost due to improvemts. in pay &amp; condns.

Memo. approved.

[Exit repves of Service Dpts.

2. Economic Affairs.

R.S.C. Encouraging improvemt. in man-power distn.

Most alarming point = pig-iron &amp; scrap. Danger to steel prodn.

Rise in Oct/Nov. in c/living &amp; wages rates.

Table 11 is v. interesting, tho’ diff. to interpret. Looks as tho’ due

partly to increased consumption as well as increased prices.

Overseas situation is precarious.

A. Scrap. Are we right to rely on the merchants? Walker did much

(? after last war) by adding another organisation.

R.S.C. It is going v. well now.

G.A.I. Man Power. Encouraging. Power of dirn in b’ground, is useful.

But people are being persuaded into useful jobs. Stabilising

staffs in firms which had larger turn-over. All this = good effects

of C/Engagement Order.

Big build up in coal-mining in Oct/Nov.

Textiles increase also continuing.

Foreign workers 91.504 put to work by end/47 as cpd. target of

100.000 which I set for myself.

53.000 odd Poles. And 6.000 in mines. 7.952 in bldg.

30.942 E.V.W. 3.405 in cotton: 3.000 odd in agriculture:

2.198 in wool: 3.953 in dom. service: 1.580 in Hostels

Services: 2.082 in mining.

Good news all round. Confident tone of voice!

Spivs &amp; drones are registering. Psycholog. value.

More E.V.W.’s available overseas.

Unemployed: 262.000. Lowest since records kept.

A.B. Payment by results is beginning to have good effect.

Men are beginning to work harder.

A.E.U. still refuse to take Poles.

G.A.I. Yes: I’m threatening them to direct B. labour to vacancies if they

won’t accept Poles.

Lister’s, Dursley, have taken some Poles.

Stokes, Ipswich, is willing to do so.

Believe men in the works will accept them, despite Union.

Woodworkers, who stood out, have now given in.

A.B. Why not pillory A.E.U. in Press – engineer psychological isolation

of engineers? Make it clear they are alone in not playing the

game over this.

G.A.I. Agreed.

A.B. Feed propaganda to Press = P.Q. in H/C.

3

P.M. Polish Officers?

G.A.I. Diff. because won’t take labouring jobs.

P.M. Can’t keep this up. Must wind up Polish Re-settlement Corps.

{ Report from Official Cttee. Agreed.

{ to Labour Cttee, who can report to

{ Cabinet what they are doing.

H.M. Textiles. Only 80% of 1936 output. Cd. H.W. spend some time in

Lancs? Cd. we have some No. 10 mtgs, as we did over

coal-mining? (employers &amp; unions). Pace of improvement

isn’t enough. No steel or raw material bottleneck.

R.S.C. Not so simple as N.C.B. Many sections in industry: &amp; many firms not

in the associations. Won’t get same results by same methods.

H.M. But wd. “spot-light” them.

H.W. Have a report now wh. I am submittg. to Prodn Cttee. We can then

report to Cabinet.

Will bring repves of Unions to Ldn. when trouble over over-time

is over.

G.A.I. Support idea of No. 10. mtg.

H.W. I go to Lancs. regularly once a month anyway.

P.M. Work twds. a No. 10. mtg. at end/January.

H.W. World prices continue to rise: but our export prices are beginning

to catch up. Increase since June has bn. proportionate.

A.V.A. The larger nos. empld on exports aren’t producg. corresp. increased

output.

R.S.C. Various explanations. Nos. swollen to get more materials:

nos. tooling up etc. This is being investigated.

H.M. Tobacco consumptn – 80% above 1935.

H.W. Have a scheme for this!

Have concluded 5 yr. contract for Rhodesian tobacco.

3. Mid-Week Sport in 1948.

C.E. Sporting organns met us v. well in 1947. Football &amp; Jockey Clubs

did all we asked. Greyhound racing not so co-operative:

various tracks outside the organisation. Now nearly all are

4

w’in one of 2 organns.

Horse-racing. Petrol restns have seriously curtailed attendance even

at wk-end mtgs. Organisers think this will continue. If there

is to be basic this summer, shd. have to ask for big races to be run

on Sats. For H/C. thght. last year we discriminated against

horse-racing.

Football. Can ask organns to do same as in ’47 – no real hardship.

But “local Derbies” outside their control.

Greyhounds. 1947 Act expires in June &amp; thereafter will be legal to

have 2 mtgs. a week. Suggd: one Sat. mtg. + 1 evening mtg.

after 7 p.m. In ’47 we argued by ref. to double-shifting: has

that bn. achieved in fact? If not, how do we justify interference

in ’48. We cd. prob. agree with the organisations on basis of

1 Sat. mtg. &amp; 1 after 7 p.m; &amp; that wd. avoid further legn, wh.

I shd. find difficult.

P.M. What has bn. the effect?

R.S.C. On Prodn Cttee all agreed tht. it shd. be continued.

G.A.I. Some evidence from Regions. Lincoln Handicap: T.U. repves on Bd.

wd. welcome extension.

Sc. F.A. contemplatg. replays mid-week.

Yorks. area. 65.000 at N.U. match mid-week.

50% absenteeism in mines because N. Year Day matches.

A.B. Psych. absurd in present econ. circs. to allow mid-week sport. Can’t

keep men on the job when sporting events occur mid-week.

Even greyhound racing after 7 p.m. if double shifts are working.

G.A.I. Will enquire what is position re 2-shift-working.

A.W. Sc. labour interests favour continuance of the ban.

P.M. Distribution workers who can’t get away on Sats.

R.S.C. Mustn’t give appearance of relaxing.

P.M. Agree: but Prodn Dpts. must support Minister in H/C.

Agreed { General line continue restns.

{ Greyhound racing: not after 7 p.m. because

{ of mining.

{ Legn Cttee to consider why legn is really requd.

{ Horse racing on Sat., incldg. Lincoln &amp;

{ National.

5

4. Summer-time in 1948.

C.E. Agreed: No more double-summer-time.

Single summer time: propose 14 Mar. to 31 Oct.

T.W. Don’t wish to object.

Agreed.

5. House of Lords Reform.

A. We shall have to pronounce on these issues. We haven’t considered them. Submd this memo. to focus discn.

Four essential condns in para. 4.

Para. 3. Can’t find that Party have ever taken firm decisions.

If not single Chamber Govt. (&amp; I wdn’t favour that) you can

defend status quo (not easy) or adjust it or invent somethg. new.

Last in too diff. as shown by Bryce Rpt.

Hence para. 4.

(ii) Shd. be power to create Life Peers. Men willing to serve in

H/L. who don’t want to saddle families with it.

(iii) No diffce of opinion on this, surely.

(iv) Some Labour members who wd. be useful are prevented by

lack of means from acceptg. Peerage.

(v) This is obvious – tho’ not so important if we achieve (i).

These wd. be pre-conditions of any discussion.

(i) I have had many informal conversns with Salisbury &amp; Samuel. I have made (i) axiomatic. Salisbury wants to find an

accommodn – doesn’t want a fight.

I wd. not therefore put it as certain tht. Bill will be rejected.

Salisbury will try to get it passed 2nd Rdg. &amp; discussed in Cttee.

Suppose there must be some talk with Labour Party about this.

But we must face this issue.

Appendix. If hereditary right to attend &amp; vote were abolished a new right wd. have to be created – one Clause Bill &amp; new

qualifications in a Schedule.

First creation is so large because since 1801 (? 1881) all new

creations have been U.K. creations.

P.M. This issue will be raised in H/Lds. Opposn will put fwd. some

proposals for rationalising H/Lds.

We have proposed (in Bill) clipping of wings.

If H/Lds. is to be reformed it must have no effective pol. power.

Do you need 2nd Chamber at all? In theory, no. Perhaps however,

useful as revising power if no concurrent legve power.

Changes of Govt. &amp; new creation of life Peers each time will result

in a larger House.

Line of least resistance in L.P.S. memo. on basis tht. all effective

work of H/L. is in fact done now by 1st creation Peers.

Other points to be considered a) Judicial Functions &amp; Law Lords.

b) Bishops. Favour leaving them as they are. For many are now

6

Labour.

I’m committed to “no 2nd Chamber”. But this isn’t inconsistent

with revising Chamber.

Disposed to consult the Party.

H.M. Inclined to agree.

Wdn’t mind leaving things as now.

Wdn’t like to propose reforms because Tories ask for it.

Life Peers right in principle.

Cd. make elected 2nd Chamber. But = Bd./Alderman: removes

dignity: makes it too logical. Value of ceremonial.

Need for something reasonably irrational.

Cd. you do w’out 2nd Chamber? The more I see of legn in practice

the more I doubt it. Scope for later amendment. Otherwise

there wd. have to be extra stage in H/C.

Bishops – inclined to favour P.M.’s line &amp; leave well alone.

Don’t be too logical: for I don’t want R.C. representn.

Shd. consult Party on point tht. we intend to have discussions.

Let National Executive know also.

A.B. Why shd. we grasp this nettle? What have we to gain?

What a controversial issue to put to Party.

Time. Pestered over Bills wh. we say we have no time for. And

serious measures of social reform This = frippery.

If you touch H/L. at all you must do it sensibly. Must therefore

start de novo, examine functions etc., - and no historical

hangovers. Either a sensible 2nd Chamber or an irrational

survival. What of Churches? If we alter this, it is us who will

have to shoulder blame (not history) for havg. C/E repd &amp; no

other religious body.

If any 2nd Chamber, why the H/Lds? All the other ideas will be

canvassed. “Industrial” Chamber etc.

Practical point re amendments is nonsense.

Leave it alone – irrational, colourful, historical as it may be.

A.W. This argument assumes we are takg. initiative.

I thought it was a ques. of our attitude twds. an initiative from

Opposn.

If all we are doing is to clip wings of existing body, we haven’t

to face all these ‘de novo’ ques. Excluding hereditary

principle = only further clipping of the wings. And, if that

is to be done, &amp; H/Lds. is to be contd, power to create life Peers

is essential.

C.E. Can’t accept doctrine tht. 195 Peers of 1st creation shd. have a right to

attend &amp; vote. If hered. princ. goes, it shd. go altogether: &amp;

existg. chaps must make the grade like all others.

Bishops. This = 1st Cab. with non C/E. majority. What a thing for us

to do. Effect on non-conformist &amp; Presbyterian opinion.

We can’t ignore repns by Opposn tht. they want reform considered.

For if we decline, we shd. encourage Tories to take it up

7

when in power &amp; put thro’ somethg. we dislike more.

This = our chance to get lasting solution acceptable to

ourselves.

P.M. If we don’t take this up, we may imply tht. we like H/L. as it is.

A.V.A. Well? Thought our view was tht. Party wdn’t accept anything less

than their maximum &amp; that that might be regarded as outside

our mandate.

Does it matter if H/L. delay this Bill for 3 Sessions.

A.W. But suppose H/L. put into this Bill their ideas of H/Lds. reform by

amendment.

J. If we don’t deal with this, Tories will.

Argument: The more logical you make the 2nd Chamber, the more

you strengthen their claim to powers. If Tories take it up, they

may not only reform it but amend its powers.

I therefore favour doing somethg. now with which we can agree.

R.S.C. I wdn’t associate myself with any reformed H/Lds. with any Sovereign

powers. A reformed H/Lds. shd. not have even the reduced

powers as under current Bill.

C.E. Must have some powers: &amp; these seem minimum.

T.W. Support H.M.’s practical point re amendmts. in H/Lds.

If we had to move careful in H/C., our volume of legn wd.

be much reduced.

R.S.C. Agree to revising Chamber.

But Party has no policy on this. And thousand diff. ideas.

How can you get a Party decn – w’out a complete scheme.

Procedure will have to be altered. Must be, not a Chamber with

diff. composn, but diff. Parly. procedure as a whole.

No-one has really examined this.

This is not a revising Chamber – only a stunted H/Lds. And yet

it will raise all the diff. points.

If we are to go into this line of business, we must do it properly.

A.B. This wd be embarkg. on written constitution.

P.M. Danger of too much logic.

Your logical 2nd Chamber wd depart from B. tradition. Our method

is to build on past, adapting it.

House of Lords was essentially hereditary. Now we propose to

keep it but abolish hereditary principle. Typically British.

Powers. Limited by Parlt. Act &amp; now by current Bill.

This = minimum to ensure tht. suggns of a revising Chamber

8

are considered.

R.S.C. But O’s in Council. H/L. have absolute power there. I cdn’t

accept that as permanent position.

P.M. Status quo: diffy of getting our chaps to go there. This is practical

diffy &amp; increasing.

R.S.C. How wd. you enforce para. 4(v)?

A. As best you can. Can’t do it really. But wdn’t accept condns which

suggested tht. balance wdn’t be reasonably level.

Driven to this memo. by the facts confronting us.

We shall get these repns. We must know how to meet them.

May give us opportunity.

The “logical” school will get nowhere. Traditional B. developmt.

method = only practical hope of getting anything.

If we don’t do somethg., someone else will.

G.A.I. Can’t avoid discussions.

Better to go in, w’out any policy of our own, &amp; hear what they say.

P.M. Must insist on Bill going thro’.

Must wait until approach made to us by H/L. Opposition.

Must adjourn this (v. useful) discussion pro tem.

A. Want a decn &amp; consultn with Party before 2nd Rdg. of Bill in H/L. in

3 wks’ time.

A.B. Wd. leak out into Press &amp; cloud issue over this Bill.

P.M. Can’t we repeat – willing to consider any proposals when Bill is

thro’: but want the Bill first.

C.E. If we show willingness to discuss, they may p’pone 2nd Rdg. until

discns proceeded some way.

Don’t want to go into discns with hands tied by Party.

Want to see the Opposn proposals first.

Don’t want to appear tht. we are takg. initiative.

P.M. { Don’t raise it with Party until approach

/x/{ has actually bn. made, &amp; proposals submitted.

H.M. L.P.S. shd. be authorised to tell Salisbury tht. we are ready to talk

if Bill goes through.

P.M. Don’t want to promise to talk. Only to listen.

Don’t let us raise this hare at all.

No harm in L.P.S. having informal exchanges.

R.S.C. We mustn’t get committed to serious discussions with intent to act.

9

P.M. No: for Party might take the line that either you abolish H/Lds. or

reform it logically.

Repeated x/.

H.M. Then A. can’t hold his posn. Can’t he say: “if you pass this Bill

we are ready to enter into bona fide discussions re

modificns in composn of H/Lords.”

R.S.C. This does commit us, e.g. not to abolish H/Lds. }

}

A.B. And to a 2nd Chamber wh. is only a modified H/Lds. }

And on neither point is Cabinet agreed.

P.M. W are not in a posn to bargain with Opposition on this.

A. I will submit a draft of what I shd. like to say on 2nd Rdg.
