C.M. 49(48). 12th July, 1948.

Import Programmes.

R.S.C. Complicated because covers a) decidg. own p’mmes &amp;

b) decidg. what to submit to O.E.C.C.

4.750 b. total. Decided O.E.C.C. shall divide. Asked for

i) budgetary and ii) commodity p’mmes. On i) – basis of

figures in Brown Books: that means 12 mos. to June ‘49

1271 in $ p’mme for U.K. That was based on total 10 more:

&amp; we shall get 1100 – 1150 $ vice 1271.

On ii) details of stocks, imports &amp; exports &amp; home

consumptn of about 100 commodities.

Summary on pp. 10-11.

Annex A to 178. 177.

Ques. a) how to adjust dollar p’mme on principles no redn of

reserves and viability by ’52.

No certainty that Aid will continue until ’52. But for

present calculations we assume it.

Para. 8 assumptions.

(i) Canada not willing to commit themselves re Credit.

Want us to make no assumptn. But if we don’t take it into

a/c Aid will be reduced. We therefore assume 60 m. This is optimistic prs: but safest estimate.

(ii) As in memo.

(iii) Tobacco not altogether excluded.

(iv) Advised by Finletter to do this.

(v) As in memo.

Further confusion. A third p’mme – of requirements. To arrive at

that (para. 11) we have added 400 m. of other commies.

No relation to what we shall get.

Another factor: availability. e.g. we shd. like more steel.

Para. 15 gives likely yield viz., 1.150. When allocn is made we shall

have to make an adjusted p’mme.

Distinction betwn. loan &amp; grant has become unreal because

U.S. now insist on our takg. all loan as condn of receivg. grant.

All therefore is now on same basis.

Own import p’mme. Must make now adjustmts. wh. we cdn’t make

later when O.E.E.C. have finished on this.

Poss. adjustmts: Can. aid (no hope of more than 60 m.)

(Para.17) I.M.F. loan to Australia (Chifly says that isn’t poss. politically at this stage &amp; I have

agreed).

Oil: If we get 1271 we cd. carry 50 m.

If we don’t some other arrangement will

have to be made. W’drawal of our help to

Europe is therefore only conditional on

our failing to get specl. help from U.S.A.

(iv) as in memo.

234

(v) as in memo.

My advice on para. 17: nothg. we can rely on except oil figure in

events stated.

Shd we then adjust import p’mme? Believe we must cut it by

50-100 m. dollars. That is optimistic. Must do it now if

changes are to be effective w’in period.

Possible reductions. Para. 22.

Wheat. At current consumptn we are much above any participatg.

country. Claims on that basis will therefore be resisted.

Allocn of our own wheat to animals is contrary to what we

have commended to others &amp; will be open to criticism.

Propose therefore to hold comsumptn at ’47 level – saving 25 m.

Canadian wheat. Wd help our bargaining with them in Sept.

U.S. are askg. Canada to furnish 19.7% aid: they will prob. say

they can’t: will make more diffies, however, betwn. us &amp; Canada.

Consequences as at (i) to (iv).

Talked to J.S. Wd agree to aim at 100.000 – with rider that it

assumes good potato crop.

Sugar: Distribution, not purchase. Commend p’poning decn until

Sept.

Tobacco: 6½ mos. stock at Sept. 49. Manufrs. regard that as

v. dangerous. Commend reducg. to 6 mos. stock &amp; force

manufr. to use Balkan tobacco. We must come to that.

Raw Materials: Recommend 30 m.

Machinery: Madness to cut for a) U.S. think of this as rehabiln

p’mme b) own future.

My proposals wd. save 75 m. at once. Consider in Sept. what more

we must do.

Annex B to C.P. 177.

Wheat – as above.

Coarse Grains – Means we shd. be able to substitute this for wheat

to farmers.

Coal – E.P.C. have settled at 20 m. tons.

Newsprint – Must tell papers no 5 p. papers before end/49.

Annex C. to C.P. 177.

Over-success of switchg. threatens to create new hard currencies.

Para. 11. proposals.

Para. 12: v. large deficit developing with non-partic. countries.

Danger tht. we have to pay in dollars or gold or divert to them

our scarcer exports. Hence proposals in para. 18.

Participatg. countries. We expect surplus. Trouble: our imports fr.

these aren’t essential. Still losing gold to Belgium: beginning

to lose to Portugal: &amp; Switz. is dangerous because of tourists.

On this: proposals in para. 20.

Para. 21. Total balance. V. bad posn. £335 m. of goods beyond our

means. Must be eliminated by ’52. Due to increase in quality &amp;

18% in prices. And prices are now rising faster in non-dollar

countries. Switch away from dollar area has involved buying

235

more &amp; at higher prices (!)

Expansion of exports. Para. 24. Add (iv) people may get from

y/ U.S. with Aid machinery etc., which they previously bought

from us.

Global. We shall be roughly in balance with rest of world.

Save tht. we have allowed nothing for a) capital investment in

Colonies or b) releases from blocked sterling.

Conclusions in Para. 27.

Decisions requd. Import P’mme: para. 24.

Non-dollar .. paras. 18 – 20.

P.M. Oil. We buy dollar oil: sell much sterling. Suggest we ask for

dollar paymt. for our oil.

R.S.C. At 1275 we wd. get dollars – in effect off-shore purchase by us.

We shd. be getting the dollars under the Aid.

A. Shd. we not switch sterling oil to U.K.? Why shd. we continue

present practice.

R.S.C. Wd break down economy of W. Europe to w’draw the oil.

What I propose is tht., if we don’t get this amount in dollar grant,

(additional) we will charge dollars for the oil out of their

x/ allocn of Aid. This argument is addressed to W. Europe in

O.E.C.C.

P.M. My point is explained by x/.

R.S.C. Can’t afford (long-term) to lose these oil markets to U.S.

A. Won’t this diminish need for 100 m. cuts?

R.S.C. No: 120 less 40 at most = 80. I commended 75. Still short.

A.B. Have we assumed appreciation of foreign holdings?

They appreciate by same process as raises our import prices.

R.S.C. Can’t take that as current asset to be spent on current consumptn.

Remember terms of trade are more favourable than 1913 and same

as 1939. In past 60 yrs. only the ‘30’s were as favourable as

now because gt. depression.

H.W. Dollar estimates are as good as poss. Accept those.

a) Annex on non-dollar is too alarmist. Takes p’mmes of Dpts. (wh.

include all we hope to get: more than we shall). cf. statement of excess imports fr. E. Europe of 55 m. But we don’t expect such a good deal with Russia &amp; others.

Also y/ is true. But means they will reduce demands on non-dollar

areas and those prices shd. fall.

b) P. 11 of 177. para. 7. Flow of capital. We discuss most diff. cuts,

236

yet £50/100 m. has bn. lost m’while in flight of gold to S. Africa. Wd have involved diffy. at end of current agreemt. in paying for gold.

R.S.C. That posn is righting itself. S. Africa is going to be v. short of gold.

And since election they have lost sterling.

H.W. Flow of capital shd. be carefully watched.

his memo. glosses over what is going on in intra-sterling area trade.

R.S.C. Memo. doesn’t cover capital.

Agree non-dollar figures are uncertain. And my proposals are

limited to two.

J.S. We weren’t aware tht. Ty. control had bn. relaxed.

Hope it won’t mean more. To inhibit purchasing from non-dollar

world.

Para. 18. want review quickly. If we are delayed we can’t buy.

Ques. of expedition.

N.B. Annex C. para. 11.

a) danger of bi-lateralism w’in sterling area.

b) increases diffy. in makg. long-term contracts.

R.S.C. On b): only temporary pending review.

H.W. Chifley on Friday. Agreed we shd. go thro’ his dollar list with a

view to substitution. Hope we can do it with other Doms.

Hope we shall go on with long-term contracts.

Have noticed relaxn in Ty. control. But don’t want it too stiff. And

want further discns. Wd make import licensing imposs. Also

must have free hand in lookg. for non-dollar commies w’in global

p’mme – subject to final approval on price.

E.B. Machinery of Ty. control needs discussion.

R.S.C. O.N. Cttee can keep in general touch.

Wheat. Annex A. para. 22.

J.S. Agree to (ii). Have always advocated (iii).

On (i) I was intending to aim at 9 wks’ stock. And that was thought to

be too low, on defence grounds. These figures involve aimg. at

6 weeks’ stock. Shd. we disclose that? Believe it cd. be

deduced. Anyway, it’s too low – apart from disclosure.

On (iv) content with my proposal in bread rationing memo (quoted

from it). We must have that cushion. Can’t have 200.000 each

week rigidly. Can’t do more than ‘best endeavours’ – and can’t

hang it only on potatoes.

T.W. On (iii). I have informed Farmers’ Union of effect of Cab.

237

decision of 22/6. If we do this, we have to supply 350.000 t. of

coarse grains ……….

P.M. Wd be sorry to see this decision reversed.

Saving is v. small.

T.W. We said we wd. let farmers keep it unless world supply of wheat was

v. unsatisf. for human consumption.

E.B. If you try to keep them fr. this, they will cheat you.

R.S.C. i) Diffy. of presentn to OEEC. Feeding wheat to animals.

ii) Diffy. of getting agreemt. to take less wheat from Canada if we

do this.

iii) Saves 15 m. dollars p.a. We aren’t justified in using gold to

feed animals. Coarse grains won’t cost dollars.

E.B. But meat &amp; bacon &amp; eggs cost dollars.

R.S.C. Proposing to increase coarse grains next year – assumg. we can get

it from non-dollar. We cd. take 350.000 out of it.

T.W. Haven’t begun to negotiate for one grain of that.

R.S.C. is quoting from an ideal requiremts. picture.

R.S.C. No. Target is 8 ½ m. tons of coarse grains.

P.M. What do you actually save? Even U.S. won’t expect us to extract

every ounce from farmers. Allow them to keep 20% will

keep it to 20%. Also they will feed bread to chickens.

H.M. Doubtful. Farmers’ incentive to grow max. wheat will be

diminished. Livestock &amp; dollar saver. Some of substitute

wd. have to be bought from hardening soft currencies. Doubt

if it’s sound economically. Sure it’s unwise politically ……..

General feeling v. proposals re farmers’ wheat – partly because

the farmers wdn’t surrender.

R.S.C. Then I must get the 15 m. dollars from somewhere else.

P.M. (i) (ii) and (iv) are accepted.

J.S. Can’t guarantee 100.000 off-take.

P.M. Take it as a target.

R.S.C. Can’t have the ‘cushion’ of the earlier decision, for the other

3.000 isn’t there.

J.S. Current off-take is 102.5.

238

T.W. Unrationed off-take was around 96.000.

Discussion adjourned.
