1. Parliament. [Enter W.W.

H.M. Business for next week.

2. Capital Punishment.

P.M. 45 back-benchers etc. Other figures.

Must accept view of H/C.

A. Will advise H/L. to accept this in view of H/C. vote.

C.E. Sentiment + religious fervour.

But my situation now v. diff. Man awaiting execution now: v. serious

case: Jury recommended to mercy: Judge doesn’t endorse it.

While Bill still before Parlt. murderer of P.C. Edgar likely to be convicted.

Believe expn of H/C. view can’t be ignored. H/C. wdn’t stand for

executions while Bill pending. If disagreemt. with H/L. shd.

kill the Bill this Session, law wd. revive in full force. Short of

that, however, I must administer the law in acc. with expn of

H/C. opinion.

Therefore intend to recommend reprieve in every case.

J. Agree. H/C. must be taken as representg. majority of public opinion.

T.W. Re-action of Police?

C.E. Don’t want to raise these ques. this a.m. Shall have to put up

proposals.

H.M. Doubtful. Hope H/L. won’t put us in diffy.

Don’t like law being set aside until it’s changed.

Suppose H/L. reject: and H.O. have to revert to earlier

practice. Can’t chop &amp; change.

J. Not setting aside the law. H.O. has right to recommend reprieve:

&amp; proposes only to do so.

A.W. In Scotland no executions at one time for period of 14 years.

A.B. Adminve considns influencing reprieve must change acc. to changing

opinion. Last night’s vote represents significant change.

H.M. Has bn. argued in past you cd. make this change w’out altering law.

Has h’to bn. answered this wd. not be compliance with the law.

General support for C.E.’s view.

145

P.M. Memoranda shd. now be submitted on [Exit G.T.

death penalty in Germany, Colonies &amp; Armed Forces. Agreed.

E.B. Getting out of war crimes trials problem – cf. O.R.C. discns.

Other Nazi cases remain.

Aiming at disposing of it all by 1/9/48 - &amp; putting all under German

law.

E.B. Shall we not also have to consider treason, arson in dockyards &amp;

piracy?

C.E. Movers of clause thought they wd. lose a few votes by incldg. treason.

I favour leaving this alone. Agreed.

[Exit: G.S., J.S., B., W.W.

3. Economic Affairs.

R.S.C. Coal: man-power not rising fast enough.

exports lagging. Quality &amp; price for poor grades are prob.

explann: F. &amp; P. are considering these points, with N.C.B.

E.B. May ruin our trade, as after last war.

A.B. Need to have effective sales organn. Fatal to leave this to prodn side.

Can’t solve this by nervous twitchings from the centre.

E.B. Also creates abroad a new kind of internatl agent. Valuable to me.

T.W. Scores of large collieries with no washing plant. Years before they

get it. M’while 200.000 t. of lowest quality coming out of

open-cast.

R.S.C. Act makes it diff. to create separate sales organn.

H.W. But Chairman of N.C.B. comes from Sales side.

R.S.C. Steel: prodn is higher than 14 m. tons. Prob. must adjust target to

ensure correct supplies of coal etc.

Cars: smaller cars going abroad: so only 50% by value as cpd.

67% by nos. Same for trucks.

Building: fall in emplt. hasn’t occurred because adjustment of

housing p’mme achieved more quickly than assumed.

A.B. 17.000 perm. to be finished in March. May be 20.000 later.

Pressure from areas where stocks of bricks &amp; unemployed

bricklayers &amp; shortage of houses. Can we have a bit of

latitude? Bricklayers won’t go to other work.

146

R.S.C. This = why we allocated addl softwood. If we allocate any more we

shall be in diffies.

H.W. But stocks are so high they are now embarrassing economically.

Forward supplies can’t be judged pending bi-lat. negotns.

A. What of other forms of bldg?

R.S.C. Steel is limiting factor there. But Prodn Cttee have considered &amp; we

are easing up.

H.W. Cars. Lower than we have ever assumed – even % by number.

G.S. Raised to 75% from 50% at end/47. Going up steadily.

Can’t go faster. Selling in some countries at cost.

R.S.C. External Trade. Feb. drop due to shorter month.

3-monthly average to Mar. 47. 101. }

June. .. 102 }

.. 112 }

Shows continual &amp; good increase .. 114 }

over last 12 months. .. 117 }

H.W. March corrected for Easter = 135 of 1938. 120 }

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 123 } [Exit J.S.

4. Wages Policy.

G.A.I. Wrong to make formal approach to Boards: Dpts. can get it

informally. If they will pass it on to us, we shall be O.K.

P.M. Why is it improper to ask fr. public boards when not improper to get

it from private sector.

G.A.I. That is view of Dpts. sponsoring boards. Not mine.

I want a N.J.A.C. for socialised industries.

H.M. Cab. told M/L. to collect informn of wage movemts.

That surely is his job.

A.B. Have raised this ques. many times. Because spirals start too often

in public sector.

We need formal machinery &amp; oblign to notify so we can watch

implications. E.g. last Burnham award wd. have bn. resisted by

Govt. because repercussions on adminve staffs of l.a.’s.

P.M. What is “general policy” in para. 2.?

G.A.I. Theory of non-interference with day-to-day adminn.

M/L. to look into this again. [Exit G.S. &amp; B.

147

[Enter W.W.

5. House of Lords Reform.

P.M. Intentn to make statement on results of discns – showg. points of

agreemt. as well as disagreemt. Will indicate the basis of

agreemt. on composn – tho’ making it clear it was all

ad referendum.

E.B. T.U.C.

P.M. Neither elective nor representative.

A.V.A. Free churches?

P.M. No. Historical survival of Bishops.

The rest thro’ nomination of Life Peers, not repve.

Crux came on powers. We admitted revising Chamber, but denied

power to delay Bill for purposes of appeal to country – or power

to force a Govt. to go to the country.

These diffces emerged in discussing ques. of time.

A. As Parlt. Bill goes, 5th Session is lost to H/C. But we resisted any

such loss of 4th Session. That was our criterion for ques. of

time limit.

A.B. Hitch not previously discussed in Cabinet. Tho’ Press knows

about it.

P.M. We did discuss it here: on ques. how far we shd. go on “time”.

A.B. There can be no compromise on real dividing issue.

R.S.C. Care to avoid “why break on a trifle of 3 months.”

P.M. We are alive to that. Met in draft.

R.S.C. Add “out aim is 4 effective Sessions”.

P.M. That is there.

A.B. Consequence of not allowing members of Bds. in H/C. but allowing

it in H/L. Power of econ. patronage in H/L. This shd. be

examined.

A.W. “Not enough boys for the jobs.”

148

6. Public Boards: Appointment of Local Authority Officials.

A.B. M/T. has asked me to agree to apptmt of Clerk to Denbighshire as

part-time member of a Transport Bd.

But M/F. &amp; P. will then approach Clerk to Glam. Co. Council.

Wish therefore to recommend that Clerks to l.a.’s shd. not be apptd

to Bds.

H.M. I was consulted &amp; deprecated apptmt.
