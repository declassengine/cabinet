2. Germany.

H.McN. No more than appeared in Times. Expect full report by noon.

May be tactical reply to currency reform or first move in offensive v. us.

We had quadrip. talks on currency: &amp; our attitude was reasonable. But R. wdn’t come to any accommn. Not clear what measures we shall take to restrict inflow of Soviet currency. Expect full report to-day.

Coal, oil &amp; food supplied by us to Berlin. R. can’t m’tain Berlin w’out our coal. Will be propaganda battle to prove who is responsible for famine etc. wh. is likely to follow.

H.D. They can get Silesian coal.

McN. Commd to Soviet supply.

A.B. But cd. spare enough for Berlin.

P.M. You shd. get in touch with E. B. on this.

201

M.cN. Generatg. plant in U.S. sector will keep emergency supply going for W. sectors.

R.S.C. Only if he can get the coal – mainly by rail.

A.B. Prestige battle. Must be sure what we are going to stand on.

P.M. Robertson shd. be called back.

McN. After we have had his report.

P.M. Yes.

3. Parliament.

Statement re short session

– agreed. Simultaneously in H/L.

[Exit T.W.

[Exit W.W.

4. India &amp; Pakistan: Sterling Balances.

R.S.C. Said at E.P.C. we cd. go to £40 but no further. But find that last year they had 80. Cdn’t cut them so low. They have suggd 3 yr. agreemt. no releases to June ’49 &amp; 20m. each 1/2 year thereafter = 80m. over 3 years. Wd. add a clause tht. wd. link it with amount in current a/c. That wd. do. And vital to avoid their going out of sterling area.

202

Hard currency: no genl. release. Will consider quick ???? proposns up to £10/15m.

Capital goods: 1947 rate for next 3 years = £35/40 p.a. for India.

All above figures for India. Proportion for Pakistan.

H.D. Their instns have bn. modified.

Approved.

5. E.R.P. Bilateral Agreement.

P.M. Explained discussions at E.P.C.

Risk that other countries may accept - &amp; leave us high &amp; dry.

Then read from T.L.R.’s brief. Points of principle outstanding.

Negotiations procdg. But posn diff. because other countries won’t press these points.

R.S.C. Position is v. grave. Read D. Frank’s message. Telegram.

Italians have draft &amp; will publish Fri or Sat. Norway on Monday. Telephone: France ready to sign &amp; has said in W’ton that U.K. alone are standing out.

Net result: as from now we are isolated. What are we to do? Must discuss at E.P.C. this p.m.

A.B. Will U.S. not realise consequences of treatg. U.K. in same terms as defeated Italy &amp; non-belligerent France.

R.S.C. Speed. And a Minister shd. go to W’ton before this has to be justified to H/C. We must think v. carefully before we present this to H/C. Tho’ alternative, as shown by memo, is disastrous.

P.M. Must find E.B. Thro’ R.A.F. or R.N.

R.S.C. E.B. is opposed to idea of Minister going to W’ton?

H.McN. Yes: he thought we shd. exhaust all other steps eg. w’drawing Amb. for consultn or personal repns to Marshall via Douglas.

P.M. Therefore he must be consulted.

H.M. Must be related to Parly. time-table.

R.S.C. If he is to go, it prob. must be to-morrow. i.e. before other countries publish the draft.

A.B. U.K./U.S. are drifting into situation which high level people in W’ton don’t realise. Opinion in U.K. will be exacerbated because we shall have to defend our rejection of Agreemt. on basis which

203

must be offensive to U.S. At a time when Soviet/French/U.S./U.K. relations are worse than ever.

Then to disrupt the W. front against R.

R.S.C. U.K. opinion, when cuts begin, will forget why we rejected M. Aid.

Draft agreement has never got above Lovett.

[Exit H.McN.

H.W. Shdn’t P.M. send for Douglas at once – to warn him of serious view we take.

R.S.C. Proposed visit to Paris. Fr. p’poned because looked more hopeful &amp; idea was a mtg. of Council of O.E.C.C. on Monday.

M’while, however, other countries have run out: &amp; prs. France too.

P.M. R.S.C. and I will see Douglas before lunch to-day.

Agreed {E.P.C. to settle immediate tactics.

{Cab. must take final decision.

R.S.C. Shd. we inform Opposn? Before we take a decision to reject.

A.V.A. Doubt it – 1931 precedent. Will be squeezed. They may contact U.S. &amp; run out.

P.M. Diff.: but must consider it.

R.S.C. Might be v. helpful to be able to say in W’ton tht. this view was shared by all Parties in U.K.

[Enter J.G., H.G., G.B.

6. Supplementary Benefits for Miners.

H.G. Recommend – w’out enthusiasm. Wd. have liked a larger contn by men. N.C.B. had, however, gt. diffy in getting agreemt. to this. Even Bd. were themselves divided on it.

Can’t afford to reject. Wd. involve major dispute with men &amp; also with N.C.B.

J.G. Fairly good scheme, on benefits.

On contns, had hoped more by another method e.g. 1d per £1 of wages. But N.U.M. wdn’t ask men to go beyond contn under main scheme. 1d per £1 wd. have given about 7d.

R.S.C. Repercussions.

If we act as censors of scheme we accept respons. for repercusns

We must take line therefore that it is Bd’s scheme – like that of any other industry.

204

A.B. This = syndicalism. N.C.B. can pass cost to consumer: want peace with men = irresponsible.

Can’t reject this. But disagree with R.S.C.

Must take positive attitude &amp; justify this on basis that mining is special case because high incidence of accidents.

Dared leave discretion to other Boards – who cd. make an extravagant scheme for 4d.

H.M. Dilemma.

a) N.C.B. shdn’t have had free discretion.

b) If we take public respons. we have to fight r. all repercussions.

Agree with A.B. on risks of syndicalism. N.C.B. have no suff. sense of financial responsibility. May discredit socialisation. They long to give way to the men.

Repercussions wd. be awkward &amp; v. costly.

Believe coal industry is in habit of acceptg. accident rate.

More cd. be done.

H.G. My responsibility. And fatal accident rate has bn. falling for 5 yrs. (apart from explosions at Whitehaven) &amp; a gt. deal is being done.

P.M. Must take the line that this = exceptional industry.

R.S.C. Control over Bds. can’t be on ad hoc schemes.

Trouble with N.C.B. = no control over prices. There is over eg. transport changes, thro’ Ratio Tribunal.

A.V.A. If these rates are accepted for a socialised industry, you can’t resist them for war pensioners.

G.B. This is v. socialist policy. E.g. widows will be in 4 classes.

Bound to have repercussions on war pensioners.

Told B. Legion on takg. office I wdn’t advocate genl. increases.

Discussion adjourned.
