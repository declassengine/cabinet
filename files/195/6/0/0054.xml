C.M. 69(48) 8th November 1948

Capital Punishment.

C.E. H/C. statements in para.1. Mine was appd. verbally by Cab. : binds us all.

Unsolved problem : what to do with murderers if no c. pun. Never bn.

x/ thought out. Our existg. penal system won’t cater for them.

Dpl. Cttee. wd. have insufficient weight. Sel. Cttee. wd. divide on Party lines and wdn’t command confidence. Recommend therefore R. Commn. with t. of r. explicitly covering x/.

V. soon I shall have to allow law to take its course in one case, prob. two.

First recn. when death is inflicted will arouse ques. about our intentions on genl. issue. Want therefore early announcement that a R. Commn. will be appointed.

P.M. No good unless you know you can get effective Commn.. Most people have pronounced their views : don’t want majority and minority Rpt. Must therefore consider names first.

C.E. Master of Rolls hasn’t commd. himself. He cd. be Chairman – suff. weight.

J. Object – amount of his ordinary work.

P.M. Any other names?

C.E. Dean of St. Pauls.

P.M. He is v. ill.

A.B. Insistence on enquiry covering genl. ques. of total abolition makes it too diff. Don’t we want to get off absolute justice and stick to historical development.

Restricted t. of r. in light of existg. practice and values, has time arrived to exclude certain categories of offence.

P.M. Wd. abolitionists accept it – wd. any of them serve on it.

A.B. I would.

J. Not opposed to R. Commn. to collect all relevant facts. It can’t be useful in deciding.

Suppose you appoint it now, and they report in early 1950. No guarantee that they won’t. Barr’s Ctte. took only a year.

284

C.E. Impose. for R. Commn. to finish by early 1950. Alternative penalty will take a long time.

A. We are commd. to some kind of enquiry. And any form of enquiry is open to P.M.’s diffy.

H.D. Practical ques : what half-way house betwn. present law and abolition. Our formula was hastily prepared. Better one cd. be devised.

Wd. take some time to do it. With these wide t. of r.

H.M. Diff. to make up my mind.

Cab. wanted us to avoid commitmt. to formal enquiry – tho’ that wasn’t excluded. C.E.’s statement was in line with A.B.’s view – seekg. amelioration short of abolition. I spoke of “investigation”. We aren’t therefore commd. to formal enquiry.

H.O. have reverted to old practice. But haven’t had a case for death.

Fears that when he has there will be trouble in Parlt.

In fact, we haven’t heard any more of this in Party. Is the Party relieved tht. this is out of the way?

If Party or Parlt. press the point, we must have an enquiry and I wd. like it limited as A.B. prefers.

Need we have early announcement?

Can’t we see the names first?

My instinct is to avoid any action as long as we can. We wdn’t want this in Election p’mme.

Thus a) wd. prefer to have it alone if we can. b) If we have to deal with it, then prefer A.B.’s t. of r.

C.E. Want to avoid announcg. enquiry after decision taken in individual case.

Or after amendmt. raised on Cr. Justice (Scotland) Bill.

P.M. Wd. abolitionists feel tht. participn. in an A.B. enquiry was selling the pass?

S.G. They wd. think that about limited t. or r.

If we can let sleeping dogs lie, I wd. prefer it.

Wait a) until we know wthr. pressure develops. b) Until we are sure we can get an authoritative Commn.

R.S.C. Doubt if abolitionists wd. refuse to participate in A.B. enquiry. I wd. not refuse. Step towards abolition – historical approach.

If you remit the genl. ques. hopeless to expect any result.

Won’t get away with no action for 18 mos. I wd. therefore favour a limited enquiry. Weak if forced by events to fulfil promises.

Try therefore for responsible Commn. with limited t. of r.

A.V.A. If no action taken, will be criticism at Election over breach of pledge.

R. Commn. must be in public : diff therefore to keep it going over Election.

285

I wd. prefer Dpl. Cttee and force report before Election.

A.B. Hopeless.

A.V.A. Then delay appointmt. of enquiry.

P.M. Believe it’s imposs. to do nothing.

A. Don’t wait until forced into it.

R.S.C. Suggested alternative t. of ref.

S.G. Those wd. re-open the main issue. Wd. be said we were selling the abolitionists. I wd. not limit the enquiry.

A.B. No pol. advantage in askg. the fundamental ques.

A.V.A. Must confine it to civil code.

R.S.C. Can’t exclude Services.

A.B. We shd. also have a list of names before we decide.

P.M. T. of r. also vital.

Risk of ques. being raised – Private Bills also.

S.G. Further diff : categories of murder. Whatever category chosen can include some shocking case. Will R. Commn. succeed in finding solution to that?

R.S.C. May be that the answer is there is no middle course.

P.M. “Categories of crime” – won’t cover person rather than his act.

C.E. Insane at crime or trial : can’t be hanged. Mcd. Commn. used to give me clear answer. Now they throw back onus on to me.

R.S.C.’s t. of r. shd. invite attentn. to differentn. w’in murder.

Want words directg. attentn. to discriminatg. betwn. cases acc. to circumstances.

J. Cd. we see revised (: limited) t. of r. and estimate chance of getting a R. Commn.

S.G. Cd. we also consider chances of gettg. a R. Commn. with wide t. of r.

Agreed : Confine to powers of civil courts in Great Britain (i.e. exclude Services of Colonies).
