C.M. 21 (48) 11th March, 1948

1. Monopolistic Practices Bill.

H.W. Sanctions. Limited to those designed to end the bad practices not to wreck the firm. Power to make Order. But publicity will in practice suffice.

A.B. We shd. take wider powers. These will be inadequate. cf. Supplies &amp; Services Bill, which has proved inadequate for important purposes.

Under this Bill, you prove price is too high (not easy) then go to the courts (bad instrument for this purpose because “restraint of trade” theory isn’t now enforced).

W’out power to make up the trust itself we can’t succeed. cf. my diffies with bldg. rings: cdn’t prove price was too high: had to refuse tenders to ring as such.

Prefer therefore simple power to make trusts as such.

P.M. You are relying on complaint. Will people complain.

R.S.C. Object is not to destroy monopolies but to control them. Can’t afford to break some monopolies because most efficient undertakings.

We believe monopolies are good if nationalised. Inherently, Coal Board is as much a monopoly as I.C.I.

A.V.A. Wd. prefer a definition of illegal restrictive practice: &amp; then proceed in courts. For it’s not only the v. large unit which engages in monopolistic practices. Bldg., e.g. = no. of small units.

H.W. Aim is to go for the rings of small units, not to bust the big trusts. cf. recommns of Simon Cttee on bldg. materials rings. This Bill wd. enable us to deal with that on basis recommended by Cttee.

P.M. “Imperfect competition”. Is this our criterion?

R.S.C. Yes: for capitalist industry.

E.B. No: that’s anarchy.

P.M. We don’t want anarchic competn.

H.W. Our aim is to remove the injustices to consumer which arise in condns of imperfect competition.

A.B. No power to deal with the big boys, only the small.

Monopoly in private hands controls the State. Can’t control it w’out owning it.

A.V.A. Cl. 3. Diff. to prove will work effectively.

109

[Exit H.G.

A.V.A. Excludes wages etc. But what opportunity to examine methods of distributing profits.

E.B. Dilemma for me. I’ve formed as many employers’ assocns as Trade Unions. To avoid anarchy of no-body to deal with.

Price. State shd. compete when you don’t nationalise in order to get competition costs.

[Exit C.E.

H.M. Bill is about right.

Suppose it came to busting e.g. I.C.I. or Unilever? Wd. have to promote legn to socialise it.

But their activities cd. be controlled under this Bill.

Trade assocns, however, necessary in themselves are exploiting consumer e.g. by condns of sale, restricting entry into industry, price fixing.

Definitions may tie you up.

We are commd to legislation on this.

P.M. Approach is wrong. Implies tht. Govt. believe in “perfect competition”. Don’t accept that philosophy.

H.W. I wd. prefer “restraint of trade”.

But see how Bill works. When I have referred to Commn because imperfect competition, see what Commn has to look for.

It isn’t a test of perfect competitn.

P.M. But Bill assumes tht. perfect competition = public interest.

H.W. Cd. find another phrase for “imperfect competition”.

A.W. M/Supply itself is preventing new entrants to radio valve trade: for defence reasons. Isn’t that inconsistent with Bill?

P.M. a) Let basis for reference to Commn be where B/T. satisfied tht. there are monopolistic practices.

b) What is posn re big trusts.

H.W. There is power to control them under Bill.

Power to bust them must be taken in ad hoc legn.

P.M. c) How effective? You said publicity alone wd. suffice.

I doubt tht. How do you get round gentlemen’s agreement unwritten?

H.W. Mostly put in writing because someone has incentive to break.

J. This wd. put law back to condn in wh. courts wd. prevent practices in restraint of trade.

110

H.W. Monopoly wdn’t dare to go on after Order made.

On breach of injunction, directors go to jail &amp; stay there.

Certain other sanctions e.g. price control, not needed in Bill.

State prodn in competn: can be done w’out legn.

P.M. Who declares “public interest”

H.W. Not now B/Trade.

A.B. I want Commn to have power to initiate enquiry. A Tory B/T. won’t refer anything to Commn.

H.W. Lots wd. become ineffective under Tory Govt.

R.S.C. Commn can’t be prosecutor as well as judge.

P.M. This Bill is politically v. vulnerable.

[Enter A.

P.M. Omissions: transport: T.U. practices.

J.S. Need for some power to break rings in food trade.

This Bill wd. be v. important in retail food distribution.

A.W. Machinery shd. be flexible. Diff. to deny that combination is sometimes necessary for efficiency. Let’s have a Tribunal but don’t tie it down.

J. Omit “imperfect competn”. Use “restraint of trade” &amp; attempt a definition. Re-draft Bill on this basis.

P.M. Wd. like also to scrutinise proposed powers of B/Trade.

Doesn’t this Bill give them too much?

N.B. Add power of Govt. prodn

H.W. Not necessary.

Agreed: H.M. to convene mtg. of Ministers.

[Exit C.K., G.S.

[Enter H., A.H.

2. Ration Scales for Forces Overseas.

A.V.A. As in memo. Accept reductions save for Palestine &amp; Germany.

R.S.C. Dollar saving = $8m. p. annum.

They are getting nearly 3 times as much as heavy worker in U.K.

111

J.S. Two cuts proposed for Germany. A.V.A. is only resisting the additional cut!

A.V.A. Net saving on my modified plan = $5m. approximately.

Even that is worth having.

H. Diff. scales in Med. &amp; F/East.

Ready to bring F/East down to Med. scale.

R.S.C. Wd. affect only a few thousand men. Real saving wd. be on general redn.

Calory content will be same. Ques. of varying from dollar to non. dollar foods.

A.H. R.A.F. in F/E. are eating 6 fish meals a week now.

Diff. to find alternative supplies if these cuts are made.

R.S.C. At home, we have agreed to come down to heavy worker level.

Can we justify 3 times that amount abroad?

A.H. } Condns abroad are v. much more diff. as regards alternative supplies.

H. } Civil opns aren’t rational at all, in these areas.

If substitutes cost more, messing allowances may have to be increased.

J.S. My scientists say the genl. reduction can be made w’out effect on

health.

Memo. approved.

M/T. to consider Merchant Navy.

[Exit H., B., J.S. &amp; A.H.

3. Parliament.

H.M. Business for next week.

Palestine Bill.

Opposn won’t like takg. 3rd Rdg. so soon. Want to wait for U.N. vote.

A.B. Much uneasiness in Party. Better from that angle to get it over quick.

E.B. No delay. Must get out by 15/5.

H.M. May be union betwn. Tories &amp; our dissidents.

Easter Recess.

W.W. From 25/3 to 6/4.

H.M. Must try to get longer at Whitsun.

112

W.W. If we can.

Budget Debate.

H.M. Oppn may not now agree to merge debate on Survey. But we must stand firm on that.

Agreed.

Statement on Communists &amp; Fascists in C. Service.

P.M. Take it on Monday. Because congestion to-day.

Broadcasts for Greater Output.

P.M. Jangle of voices. But awkward to reject.

Read draft. Don’t like it.

x/ Prefer to say agree with object, but doubt if best method.

A.B. Better say matter for Party Leaders to raise with B.B.C.

No reason why P.M. shd. reply on this to back-bencher.

H.M. I don’t want this. Too many politicians b’casting.

Cd. Opposn do it w’out being controversial.

Agreed as at x/.

Bust of Snowden to be put in H/Commons.

H.M. Bust of Snowden in H/C.

R.S.C. Not until after 10 years. That has now expired. Bust was in my room: I suggd to H/C they shd. now have it.

P.M. No precedent for C/Exch. to stand in H/C.

Don’t want to have him there.

Many Party Leaders are not put there.

Leave it with Treasury. 11. Downing Street wd. do.

4. Silver Wedding of King &amp; Queen.

P.M. Shd. Cabinet make a present?

Agreed: P.M. to deal with it.

G.T. Palace have asked tht. schools shd. have a day’s holiday.

A.B. Half holiday so that children can get their free dinner.

Agreed: half-holiday.

113

5. Parliament: Amendment of Parliament Bill.

P.M. As in memo.

A.B. Will reformed H/L. operate under this Act?

H.M. Yes.

A.B. That makes it wholly objectionable. Trouble with Party.

Don’t weaken Govt. posn by further concessions.

Can’t agree tht. a revising Chamber needs period of 15 mos.

Elevates it to posn challenging Chamber.

They know principles of Bill from introduction.

Obstruction by Opposn in H/C. can extend period.

T.W. Shall we serious trouble with Party over this?

H/L. has certain powers. Basis of discn was, if agreemt. reached on Bill, may get agreed reform of H/L. That wd. avoid much discussion of H/L. reform.

This isn’t much of a concession. And if it were, it wd. be well worth while to pay this price for ending permanent Tory majority in H/Lords.

Surely this is worth putting to Party.

A.B. Remember tht. R.S.C. &amp; I were v. doubtful about having these discussions at all.

P.M. Want general assurance at this stage tht. Cabinet think this worth pursuing.

Wdn’t encourage obstruction in H/C.

A. M/H. is making 11/2 months (maximum) a major issue.

Advantages of agreement all round.

Chance of getting a fairly representative H/L. Does A.B. realise diffies of Labour repves in existing H/L.?

By no means sure Tories will accept 12 or 9 formula. But let them have onus of refusing it.

A.W. This Act, in opn 36 years, used only twice. H/L. has not in fact delayed legislation.

Why strain now at adding 11/2 months to period in Bill?

Shd. this Govt. turn aside from offer to abolish hereditary principle in H/L.

Favour common sense vice dogma.

J. C.E. asked me to say the favoured formula. Stupid to break down on

this small point.

Democracy is govt. by discn. Involves give &amp; take. We ought to try to meet Opposn views.

Our proposal in Bill = 13 months. This wd. prob. = 141/2.

114

And in return we get, by consent, settlement of composn &amp; powers of H/L.

N.B. Favour proposal.

But recognise we may have trouble in Party Conference.

Must prepare the way for that.

P.M. This wd. involve abandonment of claim to hereditary principle.

No claim to elective 2nd Chamber: therefore no challenge to lower House.

Gt. advantage in getting rid of those.

A.B. This is much more than academic.

Tories want a revised H/L. more than I do. For I’m not sure we need a 2nd Chamber at all. If they want it, why not let them make concessions on powers. Why shd. I make a concession for somethg. I don’t want.

We have no mandate, from Party or country, on this subject.

Much bad blood will be created in Party.

G.A.I. Let’s see what the trouble is. We can sound Party &amp; shape future course accordingly.

A.V.A. Have never seen advantages of discns.

P.M. Yes: for if we imposed it Tories wd. reverse it.

E.B. Satisfied there must be 2nd Chamber to revise legn – as locus penitentiae.

H.M. Don’t like makg. this concession. But clear we can’t get agreemt. for less than 12 or 9.

This wd. give saving of 9 mos. as cpd. with 1911 Act.

Country wd. prefer this Bill handled by agreemt.

Revised H/L. wd. be good thing to have.

Will Party wear this? My judgemt. is tht. we shd. make up our minds on sensible course &amp; argue it. They come round.

Their political judgemt. has improved.

Party shd. be persuadable. Executive may be more difficult.

Agree there will be discussion.

Hope Cab. will be united on this approach to Party.

R.S.C. Wd. accept this if reform scheme is acceptable.

P.M. Broad scheme = Hereditary principle abandoned.

Initial composition = Privy Councillors, 5 Bishops &amp; odds &amp; ends.

Remainder = Life Lords of Parlt. on recommns of P.M., after consultn with Party Leaders.

Not a fixed number: but about 300.

Thereafter nomination of life by P.M.

115

A.B. Omit final sentence of memo.

H.M. Cab. can be free to look at whole thing again.

But don’t want Ministers lobbying in Party.

E.B. | If scheme is satisfy. as a whole and 9 mos. formula is in it, I will defend it

| – here and in Party.

x |

P.M. | Therefore wd. this be a possible ingredient in a scheme?

A.B. Can you complete all these discn on reform in time to allow Bill to go thro’ this Session.

P.M. Yes: we must get a firm agreement on reform before end of this Session.

Agreed as at x/.

[Exit W.W.

[Re enter C.E.

6. Lane Pictures.

P.M. Lane’s intention is disputable. The law isn’t.

Tate Gallery Bill isn’t urgent.

Why raise this thorny ques. Leave it alone.

N.B. I agree.

Irish Comms (Dulanty) wd. accept delay.

Agreed – on this basis.

7. Transjordan.

E.B. Have refused to revise Treaty when their Mission came here.

Declined to give them Treaty on same basis as Iraq.

Met at Amman. They have now agreed on Iraq model.

Want to sign if ratified.

Agreed.

8. Western Union.

E.B. Benelux Treaties will come to Cab. on Mon. Formulae will be agreed with Dpts. etc. Whole draft subject to approval.

They want me to go on from Paris to Brussels to sign.

9. Germany - Conference.

Proceedings approved. E.B. authorised to tell France &amp; U.S.
