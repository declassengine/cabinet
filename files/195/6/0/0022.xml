C.M. 23 (48) 18th March, 1948

1. Parliament.

H.M. Business for next week.

W.W. May have to be re-arranged if Pal. Bill not obtd this week.

C.E. W. Paper on constituencies by to-morrow.

P.M. Motion put down after Party mtg. No warning to Whips. They shd. be reprimanded.

A.B. Day Nurseries

Prodn Cttee asked me to consider M.O.H. supervision of day nurseries in factories. Advised no powers under Supply &amp; Services. H.O. can’t include in Children Bill. May have to ask for Bill.

P.M. Legn Cttee on Tuesday.

2. Parliamentary Procedure: Effect of Local Govt. Bill.

R.S.C. As in memo.

W.W. L.G. Bill will become law by Wed. next.

Resolution must be passed Mon. or Tuesday.

P.M. Don’t want to move this Resolution myself.

A.B. Future procedure. L.a. assocns must be consulted on Private Bill legn.

Agreed: qua immediate action only.

[Exit W.W.

Enter E.Sh., A.H., C.K., H.

3. Service Accommodation in U.K.

A.V.A. Serious situation.

Recognise help given by M/H.

But if any surplus bldg. labour available, shd. like it used for Service work – new bldg. &amp; maintenance.

H. Naval barracks v. antiquated.

M. quarters = we are v. much behind other Services. Must now provide houses in isolated spots: small p’mme of 5.000. Wd. like to start on 1.400 next year.

124

E.Sh. Accommn for T.A. is main problem. Unless we can provide it, there’s no hope of bldg. up T.A.

M. Quarters: needed 16.000 pre-war: now over 30.000. Diffies of make-shift arrangmts.

Ask only tht. Cab. shd. be aware &amp; tht. we shd. have fair share of any available surplus labour. Don’t ask for 1st priority. But want a fair priority.

A.H. Special R.A.F. diffy. over maintenance. Had to concentrate on this to prejudice of main stations. Want therefore to raise our ceiling from 6.000 to 7.500. if any surplus labour available.

A.B. M.D. has recognised tht. official Cttee for this is working well.

Service housing is counted as part of general housing p’mme.

Additional global allocn wdn’t help. Depend on local availability of labour &amp; materials in areas where m. quarters are needed.

Cdn’t give Services priority, w’out interfering with other Dpts. eg. Police Housing. Hope Services won’t claim it.

Labour. Not the case tht. when labour becomes available we can allocate it to other bldg. That wd. defeat objects of reducing investment p’mme. And limiting factor is now certain materials.

Maintenance. Posn will be easier. Circulate about to be issued.

E.Sh. Not housing only – drill halls, etc. for T.A.

R.S.C. I.P.C. are now on 1949 p’mme. This shd. be referred to them: if Service Dpts. aren’t satisfied they can appeal to Prodn Cttee or Cab.

T.W. Claims of miners &amp; farm-workers to housing – incldg. both housing &amp; hostel accommn for foreigners etc.

C.K. Available labour can be used for maintenance, in addn to ceiling.

‘Available’ means labour that can’t be transferred to other work.

P.M. Housing – thro’ M/H. Cttee.

Maintenance – by M/W. formula

New bldgs., - thro’ I.P. Cttee. But it can’t work quickly enough? Must have decisions soon.

A.B. Somethg. cd. be done m’while on re-conditioning existg. bldgs. under heading of m’tenance.

[Exit Serv. Ministers &amp; Key

Enter J.S &amp; B.

4. Economic Affairs.

R.S.C. Dollar drain. Worse this quarter than estimated. Trying to pull it up – but always somethg. exceptional.

Looks as tho’ no Marshall money will be paid until June.

125

V. awkward 2nd quarter. Trying to negotiate U.S. repaymt. of our dollar exp. in Apl/May.

Canada shy of asking U.S. loan because once bitten. And Canada is now biggest drain on our resources.

Good atmosphere in W’ton: but machinery v. cumbrous.

H.M. Output figures. Can we measure performance r. need as well as r. past performance. To discourage excessive optimism.

H.W. Cd. on cotton. Rpt. is wrong on reachg. yarn target: we haven’t in fact reached it.

G.A.I. Labour. What shall we do with f. labour if unemplt. arises?

Para. 6. 700.000 figure placed in Jan. Shd. be 10.500.

H.M. Did we set the steel &amp; coal targets too low?

R.S.C. Lucky if we get the steel target over the year. Because of scrap – also holiday periods to come. This is peak period for prodn.

H.W. C.S.O. shd. be v. careful in using target weeks.

T.W. Cd. we express in terms of 50 week year?

H.M. Apprecn of nutritional situation (para. 14) - when will Jamieson Cttee report?

J.S. Don’t know.

Figures in this para. shd. all be discounted by 5% for increase in population.

A. B/Payments. Who is mainly respons. for drain?

R.S.C. U.K. imports are as planned. Extra is all external.

311/2 m. excess: India 9: Belg. 10: S. Africa 10 = £29M.

S. Africa won’t recant, and India &amp; Belg. shouldn’t.

Canada drain = purchase of goods with U.S. dollars.

H.W. Exports for Feb. higher than ever. Jan. was 128% over pre-war &amp; Feb. is better still. Indications of resilience.

Export prices are however ceasing to rise. Balance of considns in view of turn away from sellers’ market.

Not wise to press exporters now to raise their prices.

A. Para. 24. Import prices of raw materials. What is causing trouble?

H.W. Wool: wood-pulp. Timber is turning down: hoping to force a lower price.

Wool Pool. Good qualities have bn. used up from Pool.

126

A.B. Fall in wholesale timber prices shd. be passed on in full.

H.M. Paras. 26-7. Wages.

Can we have a rpt. next time on estimated effect on W. Paper.

Also on further steps to be taken?

Another mtg. with T.U.C.

R.S.C. Don’t think anyone will forget.

G.T. How can we use this Rpt. as incentive to people at work?

Genl. target means nothing to them.

Can’t we get down to firms?

R.S.C. This is being considered.

H.W. Decided to do it, for cotton. Separate arrangemts. regionally to work out target for each mill.

A. Better if para. cd. be dissected. Drain: prices etc.

P.M. Better keep it short.

R.S.C. You can ask C.S.O. for details if you want them.

[Exit J.S. and B.

5. Strike of Boiler-men etc., under M/Works.

G.A.I. Press say E.T.U. will bring their men out from Palace etc.

E.T.U. know nothg. of this.

5 Unions concerned have urged men to stay at work. Applns made Jan.: not 12 mos. ago. Unofficial strike manoeuvre.

Will explain, in reply to P. Notice Ques. tht. men shd. stand by organised machinery.

Strike against Govt. Part of “Cold War”.

Urged thro’ Whitley Council they shd. be governed by engineering industries agreemt. Now want association with another group which has better terms. If this conceded, all engineering workers wd. want to change over.

A.B. Must take a firm stand.

P.M. Agreed
