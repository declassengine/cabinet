  <content>C.C.54(61).							9th October, 1961.

	1.	Public Investment.

E.B.	Explained draft W. Paper.

D.E.	Following year will not be much higher, but it builds up to a much larger inevitable volume in the third year.  Rolls forward.

E.B.	No commitment on figures, but I accept the point.
		Memo. approved.

	2.	Importation of Liquid Methane.

R.W.	Shd. have to give written statement of my reasons, to Gas Council – because of practice, not requirement.

P.M.	Concerned about this.  deG. will soon have to accept some decision on Algeria : my belief is that he will abandon it.  Result can’t be foretold.  Effect on Sahara.
	Alternative sources – Nigeria etc., but transport cost wd. be too high.  Oil cracking or coal wd. be competition.  

R.W.  	Nigeria wd. be cheapest.
	Total wd. be only 1/7th of needs – effect on prices wd. not therefore be v. marked.
	Real reason for this is to get coal &amp; oil interest to be more accommodatg. to gas industry because new source of competition.
	Surprised tht. Ty. shd. be so ready to accept addn. of £4m. foreign exchange when we are treatg. defence and F.O. so roughly.  Not ready to knock H. Kong about if we waste £4m. on this sort of thing.

R.A.B.	Agree : cost may rise to £7m. or more.  We need more informn.

R.W.	The diffce. of £4m. puts case in worst light because assumes tht. all oil alternatives wd. be refined here.  In fact, to reduce gas price, we shd have to import but are etc., which wd. cost as much in f. exchange.

E.B.	By 1965/6. we shd. spend £4m. in f. exchange, but wd save £7m. on internal cost.  This is justified on basis of greater efficiency.
	Lower efficiency of gas industry wd. also be damaging.

R.M.	Effect of stopping people from developing more efficient methods.

P.M.	Let small Cttee., under R.A.B., consider arguments and report to me.  (M/P., D.E., Ty. Minister etc.,)
						[Exit R.W. Enter Att.G,
	3.	Trade Union Elections.

J.H.	T.U.C. have taken effective action v. E.T.U.
	In talks T.U.C. reacted violently to the v. mild suggns. I put fwd.  Not only Woodcock, who is pathological about T.U.C. independence, but others much more moderate believed it wd. have serious effect on T.U. officiails (liable to questioning etc.,)
	Thus, T.U.C. have taken effective action &amp; will resent action by us.  But, on other hand strong feelings among our supporters.  Have therefore suggd. incln. of words in Q. Speech will imp. keep door open for further action.  Quite ready to use vaguer &amp; less specific words e.g. “My Govt. are considg. in consultn. with TUC, the problems raised by breaches of T.U. election rules”.

K.	The more general form would be wiser.

Hail.	Need we put anthing in?  Regard for trouble with T.U.’s on wages &amp; planning.

J.H.	I see that.  If I cd. get T.U.C. to say they wd. act in future case of fraud as they have done with E.T.U., I wd. be content.  But there will be other cases – e.g. Fire Brigades Union.

I.M.	E.T.U. case is triumph for democracy in T.U.’s

H.B.	We shdn’t legislate early in session : so why put it in Q. Speech.
		Agreed : no reference to this at all in Q. Speech.

	4.	Queen’s Speech : Prorogation		[Exit Att.G.

P.M.	Para 5.  Will Mali etc., be offended at not being mentioned?  Wd. some general formula be wiser? – in addn., if not in substitution.
		F.O. to consider
		Approved – subject to amendments.

	5.	The Cabinet.

H.M.	Certain changes.  Sole purpose to increase efficiency of our joint effort.
