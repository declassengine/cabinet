  <content>C.C. 67(61).					5th December, 1961.

	1.	Congo.			[Enter  M.R.

H.	If Ques. re O’Brien:  shall reply tht. his emplt. is matter for U.N.
		&amp; Irish Govt.  Policy of H.M.G. has bn. expld in Parlt.
		Shan’t disclose opinions we have expd privately.  Genl.
		concensus tht. he shd. go
	Bombs for U.N. Canberras.  Bunche is pressing for them.  If
		we decline, we shall be said to be favouring Katanga.
		But if air-war starts, Ts. &amp; Kisengar will get planes
		from R. or elsewhere.  Indians unwilling to supply for same
		reasons as ours.

P.M.	Cd we get common line, publicly, with India.  Try &amp; concert that, 
		in Delhi.

D.S.	Are we sure India has bn. asked &amp; declined?

H.	Believe informally in N. Yk.  May not have got to Nehru.  Awkward
		if he didn’t agree with our view.  Wiser to take unilateral view
		tht. this wd. risk extension of fighting.  But will explore with 
		P.D. and G. Booth possibility of a common line.

						[Enter  Perth.
	2.	United Nations.

	a)	Debates &amp; Resolutions.

H.	Wish to draw Cab.’s attention to this problem.  But see no scope for
		any rule.  Must look at each case on merits.  Honest policy
		doesn’t pay us in short run:  hope it may in long run when we
		come to resoln re own dependencies.

T.	Agree.  We must not complicate our own Colonial posn.

S.Ll.	Non-participn, on Fr. model, can sometimes be useful.  Less
		offensive than abstaining in some circs.

H.	My advice, thro’ Ambassadors, is tht. Fr. conduct in U.N., has
		worsened their posn in the world as cpd. with ours.
	We do make our views plain – in Assembly &amp; Cttee.  More awkward
		problem is executive resolns in Sec. Council.

Hail.	Unless we vote against in Sec. Council we can’t say tht. resoln carried
		has no validity.  It has &amp; in law we ought to comply with it.
		I wd. favour voting against sometimes – even tho’ it = Veto.
	Pity we can’t carry old C’wealth with us in these matters in Assembly.
D.E.	Diffy of our posn not understood here.  Need for publicity.

H.	Shall do this in a speech before Xmas.

D.S.	Also lr. to [some] ‘wealth P.M.’s explaining our diffies.
		Prs. to all, not some, in diff. terms.

P.M.	At end session, do x/.
			Also promote turn-over article in Times or D.T.
			Consider more formal exposition e.g. in Wh. Paper.
	These steps shd. be concerted by H. – soon after Xmas.

	b)	Chinese Representation.

H.	Two-stage U.S. plan.  How do we vote on first?  It is an important
                    a.		ques. and we can vote for that.  Next a R. resoln in favour of
                    b.		Peking being seated:  we shall vote for that, tho’ deprecating
		language.  Tho’ if U.S. get blocking ⅓rd against it, we shall
		in effect have moratorium.  Shd we therefore propose something
                    c.		more constructive – e.g. study group to consider means of 
		resolving this ques.  a. &amp; b. seem clear to me:  doubtful about c.

S.Ll.	Is it right to vote for b. before provision is made for Formula?

Hail.	Can we support whole of R. resoln (Annex)?  Offensive &amp; untrue.

D.S.	Simple resoln of our own – seating Peking &amp; providing seat for F.

H.	We shd be chucked out of Peking if we recommended seating of F.
	Can’t amend R. resoln, or have clause by clause vote, unless R. agree.
	All we can do is to dissociate ourselves, in speech, from 1st 3 paras.

P.M.	1.   Vote for a.
	2)   Vote for R. resoln:  but, in lieu of references to
		Formosa (para. 9), make it plain that third para.
		is offensive to U.N. [&amp; untrue because even if 
		wrong its not unlawful].

H.	If R. resoln carried, Formosa wd. be out &amp; never wd. be admitted
		because of R. &amp; Ch. veto.  Advantage of c. is tht. it wd. keep
		Formosa issue alive.

S.Ll.	There wd. be wide support for a resoln c.

H.               x	It wd. be useful only if U.S. succeed in blocking b.
		We asked U.S. to get someone to propose c.  They have failed.
                   x	If R. resoln were carried, c. would fall.

		Agreed: 	as proposed by P.M. above.
			        [Put fwd. c. only if R. resoln is not carried.]
				Put c. on order paper – if poss. in a form wh.
				enables it to run wtr. R. resoln is carried or not.
	3.	Tariff Policy.   G.A.T.T.

F.E.	1st day – tariff ques. 2nd underdeveloped  3rd agriculture.
                       *	Agric:  remitted to study groups some Fr. proposals.
		2nd:  we had done well, cdn’t do more until others matched us.
	G.A.T.T. is changing.  New countries.  Emphasis on agric. problems
		&amp; markets for products fr. underdeveloped.

E.H.	* may be used by Fr. to delay us on C. Market.

F.E.	I warned v. that &amp; had some support.

	4.	Firemens’ Wages.

R.A.B.	Council will meet again on 8/12 to discuss operative date.
	When they take a decision, Govt. attitude can be made publicly clear.
	Doubt if men will accept 8/12 date.

H.B.	Shd we advice employers to stand out for ½ or 1/1, knowing men won’t
		accept.  Or shd. we acquiesce in 8/12, if that’s best they can do.
		Logically 2nd course is not unreasonable.  But may not seem
		tough enough.  Employers are convinced tht. gap between
		13 July &amp; 8 Dec. is long enough to m’tain gap betwn. pay in
		difft areas for same work.  They will try for N. Year date if told
		to do so, but their heart won’t be in it.  At arbitration Oct. 1.
		mght. well be fixed.

R.A.B.	Cdn’t use genl. grant in these circs.

J.H.	Logically 8/12 is reasonable.  But from angle of pause Jan. 1. would
		be better.  Fits with Wages Council awards when there was 
		pre-pause commitment.  If we connived at 8/12 and it failed,
		we shd. be heavily criticised.

R.A.B.	No chance of getting Jan. 1. accepted.

H.B.	I agree.

S.Ll.	8/12 at least avoids retrospectn.  Arbitn would not.

I.M.	Support J.H.  This wd. show Govt. determinn to hold pause for as long
		as possible.

R.A.B.	For sake of 3 wks’ pay, we offend l.a.’s and enrage firemen.
		Only condn on wh. I cd. agree to this wd. be to drop threat of
		genl. grant altogether.

Ch.H.	Our only chance of defending this is as a pre-pause package.
		If we can get that across, diffce betwn. 8/12 and 1/1 is not
		important.
I.M.	Agree with Ch.H.

M.	But this is only excuse for a date as early as 1/1.

K.	Unwilling to abandon genl. grant threat.

H.B.	We were thinking of threatening it for concession of 31/10 date at
		time when we favoured ½.  Not the same for a diffce of 3 wks:
		8/12 as against 1/1.

P.T.	Either accept 8/12 &amp; defend as pre-pause packet.
	Or stick to 1/2 and use general grant threat.
	On balance favour second course.

S.Ll.	If we want settlement, no objn to 8/12.
	If we don’t because of rlwaymen etc., better stick to 1/2.

D.E.	If this is pre-pause package, cd. be differentiated fr. rlwaymen etc.,
		which are all wholly new claims.
	It is pari passé with teacher categories wh. are now being raised
		consequentially.

P.M.	Alternatives:  Let them settle for 8/12 with pre-pause package justificn.
	Tell them they must not take earlier date than 1/1:  
		a.  re-affirming threat.
	         b.  not re-affirming it.
			Let these be stated in writing.
			Final decision at Thursday’s Cabinet.
			Or prs. P.M. mtg. Wedy evening.

	5.	Commonwealth Immigrants.

R.A.B.	Party mtg. y’day p.m.  D.S. and Att.G. came with me.
		Treston &amp; Co. will continue to make trouble.  Believe we
		mght. carry Bill.

M.R.	Might lose as many as 30 votes on some amendments.  But cd. keep
		a bare majority.

	Our plan for Irish must be more plainly stated – also our understandg.
		with Eire to pass complementary legn.
	Hope R.A.B. will make wide statement on Gaitskell’s amendment.

R.A.B.	Bad tactics.  Cd deal with W. Indian point only.  Thus avoid having 
		bad division at outset.

M.R.	Shall have continuing trouble until we make our posn clear on Irish.

P.M.	Can do that on “Clause 1 stand part” – possibly make that public.

M.R.	Also put down to-night (&amp; mention to-day) amendment re duration
		of Bill.

R.A.B.	Plan for landing cards will not apply to traffic from N.I. – for 
		necessary amendment of Bill wd. lose us support of N.I.
		members and Govt.

I.M.	Balance of argument – in favour of earliest exposn of Govt.
		attitude on Irish.

P.M.	Get it out as soon as poss.  In answer to Gaitskell’s
		amendment if he gives the opening (by referring to
		Irish):  if he doesn’t, on Clause 1 stand part.
					[Exit  R.A.B., E.H.

	6.	Emigration to the Commonwealth.

D.S.	Expenditure limit.  I wd. leave it alone.  Changing it to £750.000 wd.
		only invite amendment.  And wd. make it seem that we were
		less interested.
	Actual expenditure Australia:  want to raise this to £300.000 p.a.
		This wd. still be only 7½% of scheme.

H.B.	The £150.000 extra is a hand-out to Austr.  It makes no increase
		in nos. emigrating.  This contrasts pretty meanly with the
		economies which other Dpts. are making.

D.S.	We shd. gain good-will in Australia, which we need at present.

H.	Compare this with hardships forced on F. Service.

D.S.	I won’t press at present for the money – reserve my right to raise
		it later.

J.H.	I’m not sure about renewal of the Act.  In economic terms it’s
		no longer justified.

H.B.	No:  posn has changed radically since 1920’s.
D.S.	But the powers shd. surely be renewed – for traditional period
		of five years.

			Agreed:  renew, as matter of routine.
						[Exit  H.

	7.	Education:  C.A.T.’s.

D.E.	Ministers agreed tht. case for transfer is genl. grant was so urgent tht.
		we shd. not wait for Robbin’s Cttee.  I have negotiated with 
		l.a. for 1st Jany.  Fatal to p’pone it now.

H.B.	Figures supplied were incomplete.  £3 m. was given:  assumed transfer
		to Exch. wd. be £1½ m.  Now appears tht. £8½ m. is at stake, and
		half of that is difft matter in view of S.Ll.’s pledge of not more 
		than 2½% rise.  This means an automatic addn of £3 m. or so –
		which will increase our diffy in honouring the pledge.

D.E.	We are not choosing a date for the first time.
	On the figures:  rates share of C.A.T.’s is included:  we can’t recover
		it until later.

H.B.	Decn can be re-considered when figures on which it was taken are 
		found to be wrong.

P.M.	Decision cd. be p’poned until we see general picture
		of next year’s expenditure.  Next week.

D.E.	M’while I must continue negotiations.

	8.	Agriculture:  Meat Research.

Hail.	As in memo.
	I accept Ty. view:  and so did J.H. and J.M.  But A.R.C. and C.S. are
		opposed.  Vital work held up because we can’t agree.  Public
		scandal.

H.B.	We were near agreemt. in June.  H.A. Cttee cd. have settled it, if C.S.
		had bn. ready to agree.  Ty. ready to compromise by finding 
		whole of capital cost if running costs were aided by levy from
		trade.  Genl. principle of Govt. research tht. industry shd. make 
		a contn:  who shd. this be exempt?

C.S.	All research so far is paid for – at Govt. stations.  Ty. say tht. as we
		are now to do more, trade shd. contribute.
	Contns by industry to D.S.I.R. research is mostly for development.
		This is for fundamental research.
	How explain to industry – for meat alone?
	How can we apportion so small a sum?  About ½ p. sheep slaughtered.
		Trouble isn’t worth risking for these sums.

F.E.	Our research levies are practicable only because firms are willing.

J.M.	When I agreed with Ty. it was thght. to be practicable.  Adminve
		diffies are now seen to be more difficult.

J.H.	Cdn’t we raise the money thro’ Fatstock Guarantee scheme.

P.M.	This contribn shd. be made if it is practicable to
 		collect it.  Must ascertain that before any
		announcement of capital grant is made.
		K. to consider &amp; report wtr. any is practicable.
