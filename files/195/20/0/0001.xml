		1.	Tunisia						[Enter M.R.

H.	Specl. mtg. of Assembly – on pressure fr. Afro Asians.  Strong pressure on France.  They are saying they will handle it alone, w’out help from their friends.

	2.	Trafalgar Square: Demonstration		[Enter J.H., Att.G.

R.A.B.	Last occasion 826 arrests – at gt. inconvenience to Met. Police.  Next time a similar no. might get committed to prison.  Support view of Commr. tht. demonstration shd. be forbidden.

J.H.	Only precedent 1956 – a sex maniac.

Att.G.	Same nos. might well go in defiance of prohibition.

P.M.	Para 6(a) is best ground for refusing – risk of breach of peace.

J.H.	Express written intention to break the law – by sitting down (?)

Att.G.	If there is evce of that, you can take action under Act of 1361 to get injunction.

P.M.	Act on basis of para 6(a).  If they switch to another Sunday, it is another mater.

AttG.  X/	Refuse appln for this date.  Then, if evce of intention to squat, proceed v. ringleaders under Act of 1361.

				Agreed – as at X/.

3.	Parliament

R.A.B.	Re-assemble 24/10.  Business for that week. viz., 24 and 25 Oct.  New session: 31/10 at 11.30a.m.  Stansgate.  St. Clair has taken his seat.  Persuaded (by me this a.m.) not to apply for Chiltern Hundreds.

Hail.	He shd. not resign unless he gets undertaking from S. tht. he won’t stand.

S.L.I.	If that is to be the line, better to make such a statement soon.

D.S.	V. strong case for doing that soon – don’t wait until autumn.

P.T.	Yes: if he waits he will seem to be acting under pressure.
	Agreed: Att.G. to draw up statement.  

R.A.B. 	Still reserving decision on timing.
4.	Public Expenditure		[Enter R.W., E.P., P.M.G.
					[Exit E.P. &amp; P.M.G.

	Memo. noted.  Oversea expenditure also under review.

5.	Birmingham Housing

M.		As in memo.

H.B.	Accept these conclns – tho’ wd. have preferred Swymmerton to Dawley.  But Dawley at least needs no new announcement – I said 12 mos. ago we were considering it, &amp; known tht. survey is being held.  Tho’ I shall have to give some indication to B’ham deputn.

R.M.	New town wd. compete with development areas: in respect of expansion in B’ham.  Recognise this is a risk we must accept.

S.L.I.	Agree no announcement.  Swymmerton wd. be cheaper – by £2½ m. capital and £100,000 p.a.

H.B.	But wd turn national liability into an asset.  And I wd. not allow any B’ham firm to go to Dawley which cd. go to development area.

M.	Wd. solve industrial as well as housing problem for B’ham.  

			Report approved in general.	
	
						[Exit R.W.
6.	Commercial Policy: Pigmeat

Hail.		Issue as seen by E.P.C.

C.S.	Assurance to buy 51,500 t. of pigmeat over 6-7 years: i.e. 3,000 over an existing 48,000.  First long-term contract to iron-country.  Moreover, bacon v. diff. qua Ty.  We have adjusted guarantee to hold own herd level (reducg. cost fr. £40 – 20m.) whr. we can hold it terms on imports.  This Polish contract wd. be 10% of total imports. Danish herd is increasing: must expect increased imports fr. them, which we can’t stop – unless market is depressed.  Ireland, Canada – on C’wealth terms.  Thus, Polish imports = only supply we can control &amp; vary: if we accept long-term contract, we lose all flexibility.  Risk tht. our subsidy will will be forced up.  Also will tie our hands in negotiating v. diff. commodity with C. Market.  Cd. we raise to 51,000 t. for one year – &amp; say annually for future, tht. we wd. do our best to take this quantity.

R.M.	We cdn’t cut down their 48,000 (not subject to contract) because effect on our trade.  The 3,000 extra is not v. much.

C.S.	But we shdn’t be able to buy 48,000 t. or anything like it fr. Poland if we enter the Six.  If we ‘expand our trade’ with P. (eg in aircraft), what can we buy in return?

R.M.	Not bacon – other things.

P.T.	If we do it, add aircraft as well as ships.  If we take the bacon, let’s have the trade.  C.S. argument O.K. only if we assumed we could keep out Polish bacon.

R.M.	Any cut we have to make cd. fall on the 48,000 t.

C.S.	Only if they failed to take our goods – not because we didn’t want bacon.  Can’t hope to solve agric. problems vis-à-vis Six if we tie ourselves to long-term contracts for bacon with Iron Curtain countries.

D.E.	V. dangerous to let bacon imports depress prices to a point when our subsidy to home producers has to be increased by millions.  Must keep our freedom to manage this problem.

C.S.	Discussed bacon with Danish For. Minister.  He is ready to accept some quantitative restn . But what will he say if we make this sort of contract with Poland?

P.M.	Only quota for this is on Iron Curtain countries.

M.			But other countries sell on economic terms.  Poles don’t.  As with coal, 		they swamp market whenever it suits them.

E.M.		Ships – employ 300 men and 200 on sub-contracts for (?) one year.

C.S.	Market is static: consumption is not rising.  All other suppliers are in C’wealth or in Six.

I.M.  x/	Argument nicely balanced.  But y’day’s statement surely swings in favour of C.S. view.

P.M.	Yes: this contract for 3,000 wd. increase oblign to take the 48,000.

R.A.B.	P.T. &amp; then E.M. supported x/, in spite of their Departmental interests.

	Agreed: Refrain from concluding this long-term contract with Poland.
No general statement re reducing 48,000 t. because of C.  Market.  Keep flexible.

7.	Wages Policy

S.L.I.	Mtg. with l.a.’s this p.m.  No diffy foreseen about expenditure.  What do I  say on wages?  Read draft statement.  Govt. views on increases (any &amp; if so what) must be taken into a/c.  Shall consider how to do this: &amp; meet again in autumn.  

H.B.	l.a.’s want common front with Govt.  Don’t suggest Govt. intervention to avoid their getting out of line.  Foreshadow consultns to get common front.

D.E.	Teachers – l.a.’s are out of line with us already.

H.B.	But on this Minister has a role.  On other services we haven’t.

		Agreed: S.L.I. to concert words with H.B.
