  <content>C.C. 4(62).					8th January, 1962. (3 p.m.)

	1.	Post Office:  Work to Rule.	[Enter  B-C., E.P.,
						   P.M.G.

P.M.G.	No effect on telegrams &amp; telephones.  Posts patchy.  Provinces little 
		diffy.  In Ldn. (Mt. Pleasant) 1½ days.  Diverting outside Ldn.
		Also declining bulk postings.  Posn to-day better than Saty.  
		Little public disquiet or criticism.
	Before work to rule had promised to negotiate on pay research reports.
		Declined immediate award.  Union mtg. Thurs. to discuss future
		action.  Help to moderates if indicn of end/pause given by S.Ll.
		as Wedy &amp; talks by H.B. with C.S. assocns.
	No negotiations until work to rule is called off.  Any award to be
		post-pause.

S.Ll.	This is not result of pause.  Research unit wd. not have reported 
		until spring.  Can’t we separate it.

J.H.	No.  Reasons are connected with our limitn on arbitration.

I.M.	i)  Odd to be paying overtime.  ii)  Need we take special steps e.g. over
		football-pool coupons.  Delay there wd. help to put public
		opinion v. the men.

P.M.G.	Serious break-down in mails wd. discredit Govt.

D.S.	Would it?

H.B.	Need to explain facts of dispute to public - &amp; why claim can’t be met.

J.H.	Union will be influenced by S.Ll. progress with T.U.C.  R. Smith is
		good man.

Ch.H.	Diff. to dissociate this from pause.

			Agreed:   Ch.H. to present facts to public.
						[Exit  P.M.G.
	2.	Government Expenditure.

	a)	Estimates for 1962/63.

H.B.	Para. 4.  Figure of £150 m. shd. be £200 m. – further Supplementaries.
	But figure of £110 m. still stands because pledge did not take
		Supplementaries into account – viz., above Estimates not
		out-turn.

Ch.H.	“In real terms” = pay &amp; prices.  The £50 m. in general grant for 
		teachers’ wages does not count against us.

H.B.	No.

P.M.	W’out action Estimates wd. be 4½% above – 2% above pledge given
		to Parlt. and to I.M.F.
	Vote on account is deadline for announcement.  It cd. be p’poned 
		until end/Feb. – to give us 6, vice 4, wks. to reach condns.

Hail.	Only estimate reduced is that for civil science.

H.W.	Defence Budget is w’in the 2½%.  £46 m. in real terms.

H.B.	Grateful for that.  Estimates reflect many Dpl. cuts in p’mmes to
		come w’in the 2½%.  This will have to be brought out in
		presentation.

	b)	Public Expenditure 1962-65.

H.B.	Unless we can survive next 2 yrs. no point in planning for ‘70’s.
		If we can’t show in this Budget tht. we have this under control,
		we can’t hope to save £.

D.E.	Annex A of C(62) 3 stems from date before we had decided that wage
		restraint was main objective.  Para. 12(c) is wrong:  if we can’t
		get that right control of public expre won’t suffice.
                    a)	Expre may be so high tht. taxation is disincentive to enterprise.
		Momentum is said to be so strong tht. threatens to get out of
		hand.  Actually wages restraint is more important – itself a large
		propn of increase in p. expre.
                   b)	Para. 20.  Debt interest:  £135 m. increase.  Sole mention of this – no
		explanation.  Why leave out of a/c.  If we got a growth policy
		going, f. investors need not be ????? by high interest to keep
		their money here.
	Memo seems to be based on assumptn tht. we shan’t get successful
		incomes policy or growth policy.  We shd. be planning for 
		higher figure of G.N.P.

H.B.	We shall have to work hard for 2½-3% growth in G.D.P.
	Annex is on optimistic basis – para. 10(i).  Can’t rely on more than 
		3½% increase in exports.

D.E.	Don’t believe cuts requd to fulfil pledge will help twds. growth.  Won’t
		encourage exports.  Volume of home sales needs to be expanded 
		for that purpose.

S.Ll.	10% increase in 59/60.  But p. expre ran away &amp; exports fell.

D.E.	But we had £700 m. increase in incomes.  That is the thing to go for.
S.Ll.	Due to large demand – partly due to p. expre.

H.B.	D.E. line is logical if we are ready to increase taxation.  Are we?

M.	Support D.E.  Order books are going down.  Can’t separate home &amp;
		export prodn.  If you restrict first, second won’t expand.
	Wages are basic to this.  They explain rise in p. expre.

R.M.	Pull of home market does affect b/p. both by attractg. imports &amp;
		reducg. exports.

H.B.	How expect exports to prosper when we increase taxation &amp; draw
		more brains into public sector.
	Increase of consumptn 7½% in money &amp; 4½% in real terms (reply
		to M.).
	Unless we get increased exports, increased growth at home leads to 
		more imports and b/p. crisis.

E.M.	Some of the 42.5% is more productive than others:  e.g. roads is
		productive, rail is not.

H.B.	Ministers must then be ready to cut non-productive expre.

R.M.	C. Market will make us more competitive.

H.B.	But m’while there are 3-4 yrs. to get thro!

D.E.	If 3% growth is best we can expect, and if incomes rise by 4% or more
		(recent average) we must devalue anyway – whatever may be 
		done on p. expenditure.

Hail.	Does control of p. expre assist or frustrate that effort?

P.T.	Why exempt natd indies?

H.B.	Not wholly:  but to extent of W. Paper policy.
		Also because they (e.g. electricity) are essential to growth.

H.B.	Ty. have bn. helped to curb this.  E.g. roads:  30% cut on desired
		p’mme accepted.  Have bn. trying to get supportable total.
	Won’t S.Ll. have to say soon how he is getting on with long-term plan.

S.Ll.	Thght. Cab. agreed we shd. try to restrain p. expre w’in fixed
		proportion of G.D.P.  Necessary to preserve some discipline.
		Balanced budget of last year already blown away - £200 m. slip
		in each of last 2 years.  We have this again, posn will be v. grave.

H.B.	Supplies are not due mainly to wage increases.


R.M.	Some methods of restraining it handicap growth.  Some cd. stimulate
		wage claims.

H.B.	Not as much as threatened.  High emplt. is much more potent factor.

E.M.	Ship-bldg., which is in effect in C. Market, has not bn. stimulated to
		efficiency by that competition – only moved when order-books
		shortened.  Not sure effect of that is wholly bad.

H.B.	Annex B. shows gt. increase in S. Services under Tory Govts.
		Main lines of that can go on.  But must find means for it by
		holding back some p’mmes. – cf. non-essential parts of those
		Services.  Unless we are ready to say taxation must rise.

	3.	Investment:  Education.

H.B.	Have settled N.H.S. (incldg. hospitals) on 2½% basis.  Road p’mme –
		announced.  Discussing Housing.  Broad agreemt. also reached
		on minor p’mmes.  Out-standing ques. = education, &amp; M/E.
		needs earlier decision (for 63/64 starts) than some others.
	63-66.  Doubt if we can do more than £121 m.  Even that is generous
		in view of start educn had over roads, hospitals etc.

Ch.H.	62. reduction from 110.000 to 100.000 accepted (by H.B.).  Still in
		discussion of ’63., where I want to revert to 100.000 houses to
		make some impact on slum clearance.  Housing is becoming
		explosive politically.
	Hope to consider total housing load on economy:  private &amp; public.
	Shall submit my problem to Cab.

J.M.	Agree on pol. troubles ahead in Scotl. because private bldg. did not
		grow.

Hail.	How do you equate educn &amp; housing.

J.M.	My problem on schools is difft fr. E. &amp; W.

D.E.	Fwd. programming has bn. built in to school bldg.  Pushing starts
		fwd. need public announcement.
	My memo. assumes genl. agreemt. tht. training college &amp; techn. educn
		bldg. can’t be cut at all:  &amp; that all redns fall on schools.  H.B.’s
		memo. spreads slow-down over whole p’mme.  I have already
		in July pushed training coll. fwd. by one year – w’out
		announcement fwd. now have to announce a 2 yr. slip.

H.B.	Para. 4 of my memo.  Training coll.:  peak of starts has bn. passed.
		I favour £5 m. p.a. starts as cpd. with £6 m.  Marginal effect on


		output of teachers.  Further educn:  £15.7 m. continuing vice
		rise progressively to £22 m.
	“P’mmes announced” – but only provisional, 18 mos. ago.

D.E.	Benefit fr. any slow-down wd. not be worth-while.  Outcry wd. be
		much more than gain.  Pledge re classes:  training colleges.  On
		techn. educn the bulge is due to C.A.T.S:  inconsistent with
		policy of growth.  Thus, all cuts must fall on schools.  L.e.a.’s
		ready to go ahead.  I shd. have to make announcement going 
		back on Wh. Paper of ’58.  In informed circles it is said tht. rate
		of investment is already too low.  Lowest figure I cd. accept
		w’out public announcement is £131 m. average for next 3 years.

H.B.	Other Ministers have had to adjust p’mmes publicly.
		Present 3 year average is well below £131 m.
	Only in v. long term is education investment conducive to growth.

D.E.	Really?  A level nos. are growing faster than no. of teachers.

	4.	Nutritional Services.

	a)	Cheap Milk.

E.P.	Wish to press for concession to 3-child families all under 5. 
		Nutrition experts wd. then say there wd. be no risk.  Cost £1½ m.
		Adminve complications.

H.B.	Ready to make this concession.  £17½ m. net assumed in memo., has
		risen to £20½ m. because change in price of milk.  Tho’ we 
		shdn’t get full benefit in 1st year.

J.B-C.	Cdn’t get it in operation before mid-summer.

Hail.	Hope we shan’t keep nibbling at this.

E.P.	Nutritional posn of largest families is unlikely to vary over next few
		years.  It wd. in future be confined to precise nutritional risks.

J.H.	V. bad moment for this.  Will be politically v. embarrassing.

	b)	School Meals.

D.E.	Can’t say that education wd. suffer.
		It means 2/6 extra for each child at school.  Will be
		misrepresented at a time when we are seeking wage restraint
		(and reducg. surtax).

M.	Unfortunate to do this when we are trying to keep incomes down.

	c)	School Milk.

D.E.	We cd. save £870.000 by w’drawing free milk from independent
		schools.
		Political trouble – mainly from our own party.

	d)	Family Allowances.

S.Ll.	This might be a runner in reln to relieving lowest level of income-tax
		payers.  There is a taxation justification for that.

J.B-C.	But wd. Sharpen differentiation v. Poorest, who get ch. allowances net.

I.M.	Redn of 8/- p.wk in millions of families – at time when we are seeking
	wage restraint.

J.B-C.	If this is to be pursued, I shd. want to put in a memo.

I.M.	Also requires legn.

J.B-C.	V. wide-ranging legn.
