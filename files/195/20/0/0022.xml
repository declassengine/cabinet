	1.	Foreign Affairs.		[Enter M.R.

a)	Portugal, Goa.

P.M.	Note from Embassy, referring to 1899 agreement, &amp; askg. how H.M.G. can make available joint means of defending Goa v. aggression by India.

E.H.	We are pledged by that to help in defendg. P.’s colonies.
In ’54 when similar appeal made we said we cdn’t. engage in war v. a C’wealth
              a.		country. Presumably we stand on that, qua force.  But 
              b.		reprns to Delhi, assuming India wd. not use force – supplemented by P.M. message to Nehru.  Also advice P. to raise it in Sc. Council (if they feel they really are threatened)
              c.		U.S. have warned India.
              d.		Overflying rights for P. to re-enforce Goa.  Minimum:  Mauritius.
Tho’ they have asked for Gau:  wh. we have never conceded to anyone – even U.S.

			Agreed:  as at a.

P.M.	? Tell N. we have bn. approached by T:  we have replied as at a., adding tht. we think it inconceivable tht. N. with his pacific reputn shd. make armed attack on Goa.  Make this a public reply – or at least let it be known.
	To Portugal:  inform as at a.  On d:  we can’t do that if we have taken public line as at a.  Tho’ ? offer facilities if movement can be normal.  Too dangerous perhaps.

			Agreed:  must reject d., as incompatible with efforts to check Indian action.  Also Hindus in M’Tius.

	On b. avoid personal message to Nehru – offl. thro’ G. Booth.
			Tell Portuguese d. wd. make Nehru more likely to reject b.

b)	U.N.  Chinese Representation.

P.M.	Since Cab. last discn, seems there will be para. by para. vote on R. resoln.
We can vote on 3rd para.:  against – and can take that chance to explain our posn on Formosa.  Then vote for resoln as a whole.
	Para. vote makes a new situation.

	2.	Common Market.

E.H.	Brussels mtg. Friday.  V. businesslike.  Review of offl’s. work.
Two decns on procedure.  Agreed no need to argue more on principles better to have details examined.  i) This was applied to manufactured goods fr. C’wealth countries (under 2% of imports into U.K.) Canada mainly affected.  ii) Rest of C’wealth produce.  We suggested A.O.T. treatment for all.  Six didn’t want that applied to India.  Agreed we shd. examine countries separately in detail.
		Chairman:  to rotate, every 3 months – incldg. U.K.  Diff. for us, but we accepted in principle – no pre-arranged order of roster:  we cd. therefore avoid havg. take Chair critical phase
	Looks as tho’ we can get whole field under study in a series of patterns w’out reachg. separate decns on each.  This wd. avoid slippery slope.

	3.	Congo.

I.M.	Danger of Thursday’s debate:  it is on adjournment.  Might therefore get all our opponents in lobby against us.  Two difft. attitudes of criticism.  Extremists (Hinchs etc.) are not to be appeased.  Another group favours him we are trying to press on U.N.  (Aquar etc.)  Favour therefore motion which latter group cd. support.  Cd announce that at 3.30 to-day:  motion wd. have to be handed in before H/C rises to-night.

		Agreed.

P.M.	H. will return to Ldn. this p.m.
	U.S. are declining to join us in appealing for cease-fire.  Rush thinks opn shd. continue, so as to enable U.N. to get control.
	Bomb ques. has opened wider issue of attitude to U.N.
a)	Some wd. like to have U.N. altogether &amp; preserve our liberty.  That we shd. avoid.
b)	We might consider dissociatg ourselves fr. this U.N. operation.  But first we shd. try to get U.N. policy on Congo more into line with reality.
c)	On bomb:  cd. we prs. say tht. sitn has changed to extent tht. we must reverse our decn.  No sufft confidence in local U.N. leadership.  Won’t send bombs until posn at N.Yk. has bn. clarified – as under b.  If this showed U.N. were intendg. to co-erce K. by force, we cd. prob. w’draw our support of this operation.
	Further (informal) discussion in H.C. this p.m. – with H.
			                                                         [Exit P.M., E.H., I.M., M.R.

	4.	Public Expenditure.                        [Enter R.W., J.B-C., E.P., D.E.

H.B.	Two pledges by S.Ll.  a) Exp’re w’in q.n.p.  b) The 21/2% increase for 62/3.
		On long-term we are making some progress – e.g. roads, defence.  But 2 gt. problems:  agriculture &amp; education.  If we cd. get these [Agriculture:  open-ended commitment:  suppl. estimate of £78m because collapse in market for beef, mutton &amp; pigmeat.] contd we cd. work out long-term policies within a).
	But on b., first figures are alarming.  They show increase for 62/63 of £398m or 71/2%.  The 21/2% was “in real terms”:  but even so to achieve this will need economies of £100m.  We have £15m fr. minor admve savings.  Nutritional memo. shows scope for £47 or so (?) wtr. fam. allowances or other means.
	Add to C.199 this new informn re Estimates.
		Out-turn will be about £150m. above Estimates for 61/62.

S.Ll.	Surplus above line was £500m.  Then regulator £130m added.
Giving overall surplus of
	Supplies £205m. as like as not, in total. – less saving of £50.  Net £155.
But another £50m. below line.  Suggests overall deficit:  and surplus above line much less than we forecast.
	Effect on  £ may be v. serious.  I.M.F. attitude will be affected.  All therefore will turn on evce tht. we shall stick to what we said on 21/2%.

R.M.	Assumes public &amp; private exp’re continues at same rate.  There is a case to be made for letting some factors in public go ahead &amp; restraining private.

H.B.	Agree qua public investment exp’re.  But p. expendre of all kinds is nearly 45% of q.n.p.  If that rises even further, effect on exports wd. be fatal unless Draconian measures taken to restrain private expend’re.

Hail.          x|	of para. 2.  Unrealistic to imagine we can reduce taxation in these circs.  We cdn’t cut defence for that reason.
	Do you cure inflation by transferring money from poor parents to the general tax payer.

H.B.	These decisions are necessary if we are to avoid increasing taxation.
	But main issue is para. 4., not 2.

M.	Reason for para. 3 – q.n.p. hasn’t risen.  But can’t let this go on.
Memo. shows case for drastic action.

S.Ll.	Must be some redn of tax for incentives – tho’ no decrease net.

R.M.	Para. 4.  Scope for fewer t.v. sets &amp; more education. 

H.B.	That means higher taxation.

D.E.	Agree there must be a level of p. exp’re wh. cd. be debilitating.
But as countries develop they naturally spend more in public sector.
	We must therefore look now at total:  &amp; then its distribn.  Objective:  growth.  Test items v. that criterion.  Have we bn. sufficiently ruthless in eliminatg. elements that don’t promote growth?
Deficits on natd indies (£200m):  excessive interest rates.  Must be ruthless, but selectively so.  Power of collective bargaining in full compl. is so great tht. we must limit it:  can’t allow incomes to rise at rate of £500/600m p.a.  With coherent policy made plain, we might get support.  But deflationary policy in Budget with all it unpopularity combined with appeal for support for wages policy – no hope of success.

K.	If you support policy of growth, surely you must support leaving more money for private investment.  Again:  you can expand technical educn to appoint which threatens immediate growth – by using investment money &amp; teachers more urgently needed for export promotion.

D.E.	No lack of private investment funds – we have raised interest rates to limit it.

R.M.	Also shortage in industry is skill not bldgs.

H.B.	Accept need for growth.  But can’t afford simultaneously all projects justifiable by that test.
	Moreover, we shall have to cut back in other directions.

R.A.B.	In simple Budgetary terms we must find £85m of savings.
We must get down to short-term brass tacks.

	5.	Agricultural Policy.

C.S.	Genl. picture of the year is good – apart fr. meat collapse.  That apart, exp’re is only £10m above estimate.
	Meat:  market collapsed at start of year.  Price fell May from 160/- to 90/- in a few months.  Sheep followed because large production of lambs.  Then Danish pigs flooded in &amp; bacon/pork market collapsed.  Small xmas improvement, but worried re future.
	Diffies in cattle nos. slaughtered only .2%.  Imports down.  2% increase in quantity produced fall of 14% in prices.
	£67m increase in subsidies.  £31m to farmers.  £35m to consumers in retail prices.  Balance to distribution (not all in profits because larger quantities handled).
	W’in support system we can do nothg. to hold market up.
With free entry fr. Argentine, Denmark &amp; N.Z., we cdn’t try to keep price steady – as other countries do.
	Happened before on one or other item.  This year on all meat.
	Immediate tasks.  i) a minus on Price Review.		[Enter E.M.
			           ii) induce farmers to accept policies we shall have to 
                        introduce if we go into Six.
		{56m. increase in our subsidy
		{160m increase in costs carried by farmers.
	These are figures for period of years in wh. world shortages ruled.  The policy has paid off.  But it won’t do when world surplus of food.
	We shall have to switch to new policy if we go into Six.  We must now work out policy we shd. favour if we don’t.  Fundamental (but different) changes.  M’while ’57 Act will have to remain, for this Parlt.

R.A.B.	Tho’ tough – can’t under recent pledge be more than 21/2%.
Moreover, can’t reasonably say in advance we shall rig review.
Unconstitutional.  Throws over Act and pledge.

H.B.	Avoid a specific figure.  But indicate we shall have to be tougher.

P.T.	Is para 19 (iii) realistic?

C.S.	Not unless we legislate or went in for support of market by buying, or controlling imports.

J.M.	Also breach of pledge re 21/2% p.a. in Review.

J.H.	Also 4% for a particular item.  And for this Parlt.

S.Ll.	Not inconsistent with pledge to farmers if we shifted burden in part to consumers.

R.A.B.	New system envisaged for Common market wd. take 11/2 yrs. to work out.

Hail.	What about grants – ploughing, fertilisers.  Is this sensible in present circs?

C.S.	They are in Review:  and are w’in the 21/2% pledge.
	These have bn. used because diffy. of m’taining farm income without raising commodity prices too high.  Also less risky – not open-ended.

H.B.	Accepting pledge is inviolate, cdn’t we ask offls. to study what cd. be done to safeguard Exchequer.

C.S.	Yes.  But avoid damage to good policies for sake of	[Exit S.Ll., H.W.
		our years’ diffies.  Some grants we cd. continue to pay, even in Six – e.g. hill-farm subsidy, farm improvement grants.  Don’t throw them away now because immediate diffies.  Other grants (fertiliser, calves, ploughing) wd. have to go under Six.

R.A.B.	Agree	i) suitable public warning of stiff Review.
			ii) good explann of reasons for Supplementary. 
			iii) study by *officials, as at X/, of possible savings in   1962/63
	Ty., M/Ag, Sc.Off., B/T.
C.S.	Doubt if I can say v. much in presenting Supplementary Estimates on Monday.

J.M.	And, while ready to examine (3), doubt if there is much we cd. do.

C.S.	Only remedy for next year is to control amount of meat coming on to market.
This wd. mean restrictg. imports – only means is by vol. agreement, which I can’t get if B/T. export aims are over-riding (e.g. Polish bacon) and also Govt. buying of home production.

H.B.	If we can’t control exp’re elsewhere, we must act when we can. e.g. Farm Improvement etc.
