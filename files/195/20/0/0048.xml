  <content>C.C. 22(62).					20th March, 1962.

	1.	Disarmament.		[Enter  M.R.

P.M.	Conference not going well.  May turn on “verification”.
	Nuclear tests.  Idea tht. national systems of detection may suffice –
		Penney etc., in W’ton:  looks as tho’ U.S./U.K. concln may 
		be tht. this will be so but is not so yet.  Instruments patchy
		between 500 &amp; 1000 miles distance.  Even so, however, there
		wd. have to be some internatl inspn.
	Can we avoid argument about this:  and get R. down to ques. – are
		they refusing to have any kind of verification.  May have to get
		this up to K.

	2.	Economic Survey.

S.Ll.	Hope this may be the last – float it off to N.E.D.C.
		Angled to small audience, financial journalists.
	Been thro’ E.P.C.  Not quite right yet.

P.M.	Part II is dangerous surely.

S.Ll.	Contains little that wasn’t said y’day.

P.M.	Can’t say we predict 4% increase in production.

D.E.	Para. 3-8:  an account of unsuccessful management of economy.
		An indictment on ourselves.  Why not begin at para. 9?

S.Ll.	Shortens Budget speech.

P.M.	Perhaps L. President will do Part I into English?

Hail.	No.

P.T. 	If we have to publish (I hope for last time) it will have to issue in much
		this form.

M.	Final para. shd. be adjusted, as E.P.C. contemplated – esp. omission of
		word “particularly”.

H.B.	Accurately summarises what we said in debate y’day.

P.M.	Have another go at Pt. I.  Delete paras 1-2.  Include (e.g. in para. 17)
		refce to appln to join E.E.C.
	Minor amendments to be sent to S.Ll.
					[Enter  C., J.P., J.A.
	3.	Security in Public Service.

P.M.	As in brief.
	Presentation 27th March, with short statement in both Houses.
	Satisfactory outcome qua M.I.6.
	Opposition leaders may be willing to avoid debate esp. on M.I.6.

I.M.	Better to p’pone publn for another week – 3 or 4 April.  Tuesday 3/4.

D.S.	O. Secrets Act useless in reln to r. &amp; d.  Ch. Pincher. Can’t be 
		prevented from publishing it.

E.H.	Unfortunate from this angle tht. Pt. III is to be published.

P.M.	Pincher is embarrassment rather than risk.
	Disclosure of operations is more serious.

P.M.	Let Security Cttee consider this general problem.
		Let any Minister who wants to do so put in a memo. (Min. Cttee).

E.H.	Communist penetration of C.S. Unions.  Hope H.B. will consider 
		means of alerting membership.  Agree can’t publish this chapter.

	4.	Kenya.

R.M.	In view of disagreement – i) no demand for independence date
		ii) willingness to accept a lead from U.K. Govt.
	Wish now to outline to Conference a constitn on lines suggd in memo,
		linked with idea of Coalition Govt.  Means bringing Kenyatta
		in, tho’ offl. wd. be head of Govt.
	Br. troops wd. remain until at least independence.  Algerian 
		settlement may help to get this (established or) agreed.

K.	Para. 15 seems to be crux.  No new constitution at once?

R.M.	No.

Hail.	If last sentence of 7 is correct, why put him in Govt?	[Exit  P.T.

R.M.	W’out coalition Govt. you will encourage extremists in K.A.N.U.

Hail.	Cdn’t you get Coalition without K.A.N.U.

R.M.	No:  Kikuyu are 37% and K. is their leader.
		But his mental powers, &amp; his influence, are declining.

Hail.	You will never be able to say he is unfit for office, if you have put
		him into office yourself.  Looks unprincipled.

R.M.	Mboya can’t break with Kenyatta yet.
	K.A.D.U. wd. accept coalition under official Minister.
		If K.A.N.U. reject proposal for coalition, this will drive wedge
		between moderates &amp; extremists in it.
C.S.	Earlier expectations of Kenyatta going off have not been fulfilled.

Hail.	Believe he is a formidable political figure.  If we are beaten, and
		he emerges – we can’t help it.  Another matter to put him
		in posn of responsibility ourselves.

P.M.	i)	Are we ready to compensate smaller farmers to get them out.
	ii)	Are we ready to w’hold independence thro’ life of this Parlt.
	iii)	Are we going to keep troops in Kenya until then?
			Study what France has bn. able to keep in Algeria. (F.O.)
	What is our image of the ultimate solution?

H.B.	Cost of i) – taking account of inefficiency of African farmer.

J.P.	We can leave troops there:  but prob. need is for re-inforcement.  And
		our plans assumed disappearance of this commitment by ’63.
		Mght. need to revise ideas of size of Army.

P.M.	No:  we wd. take Brigade out of B.A.O.R. – as France has done for 
		7 yrs.

Hail.	Since ’45 coalitions have all led to dictatorship.

E.H.	? Italy:  W. Germany.

H.B.	Support R.M.’s plan.

D.S.	Prefer to play for refusal of coalition offer.

R.M.	If they accept it, they will try to make it work.  If K.A.N.U. reject it,
		the party will split.
