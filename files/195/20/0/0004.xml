  <content>C.C.49(61).							5th September, 1961.

							[Enter M.R.
	1.	Congo.

H.	Confusion.  Adoula P.M. : Gizenga Deputy P.M. (L. Govt.).  Chance of United Govt. if Tshombe can be squared over Kantanga. Hammarsk. propose to remove advisers who have deterred T. from negotiating with Adula.  Belg. mil. advisers removal consistent with resoln. of 21/2.  But Sec Gen has gone further – accusing T.’s deputy of attempted murder, &amp; open to charge of interfering with internal politics of Katanga.  Disturbing to Salisbury &amp; his colleagues here.  Shall advise Sec-Genl not to try to remove T’s civil advisers : warning him we cd. not support U.N. in that.  Sec. G. says he will apply same treatment to Kisenga’s advisers.

D.S.	R.W. v. excited : has encouraged T. to resist, with informn. re our attitude towards U.N. intervention in Katanqa.  I have urged him to refrain from more violent action.

Hail.	Is U.N. action legal?

H.	They intervened to support central Govt.  of whole Congo.  There is now such a Govt. again.

D.S.	Self-determination?

H.	If Katanga separated off, we shdn’t come to its defence.  Wiser that it shd. adhern to Congo, esp. if that can be done peaceably.
	Spaak is willing tht. mil. officers be repatriated.

P.M.	Our objective is to avoid E/W. struggle between provinces in Congo.
	We must support U.N. in trying to achieve this.

I.M.	General problem.  Frontier (Katanga) as unusal as most in Africa.
	We shall have similar problems – e.g. Somalis &amp; Zanzibar strip in Kenya.  Kabaka in Uganda.  We shall have same choice beween imposing unity or having a chaos.

D.S.	Only practical course for T. is to get best terms he can : longer he waits, worse terms he will get.

	2.	Nuclear Tests.

H.	Two explanns. i)	far behind in rocketry : series planned some time.
	Tests concerned with interceptn. of I.C.B.M.’s.
				ii)	timing : must have bn. deliberate vis-à-vis.  Belgrade.  Execution of tactics of intimidation followed at U.N. 1960.  Hoped neutrals wd. press West to make concessions.

D.S.	Neutrals’ protests pretty feeble epd. with their ferocity over Fr. tests cd. our repive make the point?

H.	Will consider that.  Neutrals are always more polite to those whom they most fear.

P.M.	Need for careful thought on this.  urge U.S. not to make any precipitate public statement.
	M/D. to submit S.2: - appreciation of need for tests in atmosphere – to P.M.

	3.	Berlin.

H.	Memo. states latest posn¬.
	b)	Build-up of mil. strengths.  Idea of large-scale probes has bn. given up.  U.S. realise any large reinforcement in Berlin wd. be at risk.  But they do want to build up NATO strength.  Danger in this.  But U.K. may be right in thinking tht. w’out this K. might be tempted to nip off Berlin.
	We can’t do much more w’out conscriptn. or reservists.  U.S. don’t like this reply, wh. they have had, v. much.  We have said we can’t do reservists until sitn. more critical.

	c)	Economic measures.  U.S. want full p’umme – now they have put less reliance on mil. measures.  Plan is to begin with air-lift then econ. measures escalating to full blockade.  We have said this will hurt West more than Soviet bloc &amp; suggd. they be limited to E. Germany.  U.S. reject that.  They regard blockade as alternative to war.

	a)	Neogtiation.  We aimed at statement by end/Aug. contemplating mtg. in Oct.  U.S. backed off when Fr. were so intransigent – fearing to expose difference betwn W. Powers.  Settled for announcement only of mtg. on 14/9.  U.S. Amb. will try in while to get K.’s view.  Hope mtg of 14/9 will result in announcement. we hope to take to Grom.
	Clear we must negotiate.  Not clear what our tactics shd. be.  Wide front will get us nowhere.  May be better to start on access to W. Berlin, poss. thro’ Ambassadors.
	Trying to play down crisis.  All are searching for negotiating posn.

	Miliary measures.

P.M.	Cdn’t call up reservists w’out Parlt.  Debate on that (w’out aim of negotn.) wd. weaken Western position.

H.W.	In transition fr. conscript to regular basis – awkward moment for this crisis.  BAOR is 3.000 under peace-strength of 55.000.  Norstadt asking for war strength – out of ques w’out conscritn.
	Measures we can take won’t increase real strength of B.A.O.R.  Most I cd. offer is to hold it at present strength over next 6 months.
	We cd. say tht., if thing got worse, we cd. unbody TA - ¼m.

H.	U.S. accept tht. reservists wd. be short-term.  Their criticism is tht. we can’t do other things to strengthen B.A.O.R.

H.W.	Considering means of w’drawing specialists from other theatres
	General approval for this attitude.

H.W.	Helpful if NATO cd. be brought more into military picture.

H.	Stikker is mtg. Ambassadorial Group.

	Economic Measures.

R.M.	Wdn’t harm Soviet Union.  Mght hurt Poles &amp; E. Germans.
	Pity U.S. can’t be made to realise that.

S.L.I.	Agree.  We shd. look v. foolish.  U.K. more damaged that Allies.
	Action v. E. Germany wd. really bite.

E.M.	To make it bite on shipping, NATO Powers alone wdn’t do.
	Effect on U.K. v. bad.

H.	But so would war.  This isn’t contemplated until access to W. Berlin is completely blocked.  This wd. be v. brink of war.

Hail.	If it hurts no more than them, it will involve us in dipl. defeat – for we shd. have to w’draw it.

R.M.	Do it, if at all, on moral grounds viz., not to trade with an enemy.  But don’t suppose it will bring any economic pressure on R.

M.	Blockade, in crisis.  Most of war, has  never bn. successful.

P.M.	Must handle this tactfully with U.S.  Might, it low level, but in some informn. re small economic effect on R.

D.E.	Only frontier we cd. close is E/W. Germany.  That wd. embarrass E. Germany.

H.W.	Denial of N.A.T.O. airfields to R. aircraft would hurt them.

Hail.	Wd. U.S. not realise it is nonsense if we demonstrated that.

P.M.	Stress special advantage of quick action v. E. Germany.
	Go slower on general blockade planning.

H.	Cd. work that idea into concept of escalation, which we have
		persuaded U.S. to accept.

S.L.I.	Action v. E. Germany wd. hurt R. – to extent tht. they wd. have to sustain it, instead of exploiting it.
	Agreed:	work up advantages of action directed immediately to E.
			Germany.
			Stress lack of harm to R., not harm to U.K.
			Also have on movement – airports, ports.

	Negotiations.

H.	Mtg. of 14/9 will follow Thompson’s talk with K.  Hope to be able to talk to Gromyko.
	French position.  Negotn. must mean concesion.  Transfer to E. Germany need not matter : for E. Germany will be trying to gain respect &amp; won’t be likely to take awkward action on access.
	Our feeling has bn tht. we wd. do better out of K. before a Treaty than out of Ulbrecht after it.

H.W.	Gt. risk of outbreak of firing – thro’ tension in Berlin.

H.B.	Fr. posn., tho’ logical, is v. dangerous.  

S.L.I.	Agree.

P.M.	Fr. view based, not only in logic, but in pessimism and in cynical attitude tht. W. won’t fight over Berlin.  Negotn. will lead to bad outcome – diplomatic defeat.  Better therefore to wait : outcome may not be so bad.
	Don’t share that conclusion.  Br. opinion wd. not be content w’out negotiation.  And build-up is not now so bad – more general negotiation tht. some concessions will have to be made.

	4.	United Nations : Represenation of China.

H.	Para 6.
	“Important question” is a device, but w’in the rules.  We cd. support it.  If carried &amp; there were straight vote to seat Peking, we shd have to vote for it.

P.M.	O.K. with A. &amp; N.Z.?

D.S.	Yes : if it’s agreed with U.S.
					Agreed.

	5.	Kuwait.				[Enter K.

H.	Ruler has accepted concept of a stock-pile.  He will pay.  O.K.
		Agreed : net is implement stock-pile plan.

H.W.	If we assume we must retain capcity to intervene w’in 36 hours this is minimum.  But I would like to be able to review it when we see what Arab League force is like.

S.L.I.	Hope we can wait.  Hope F.O. willalso consider pol. means of securing our interests in Kuwait.  We might also balance value of K. against cost of its military defence.

P.M.	Ruler will be under increasing pressure from Arab League.

H.W.	A rather larger presence in Bahrein wd. pay a dividened.  Need not pro-retain capacity to intervene in 36 ours.

	6.	Economic Situation.

S.L.I.	Employment – pressures relieved a little, tho’ unusually large no, of school-leavers.
	Production – seems to be rising.
	Sterling – 2.80¾ satisfy.  Reserves not too bad : tho’ 3rd week in Aug. was worrying (Berlin).  Net improvement over Aug. is about £35m.  Sept. shd. be reasonably good.  But longer prognosis is gloomy.
	Bank rate is damaging exports.  Need study of provision of finance for exports.
	Wages Policy.  Mtgs. in Aug.  C. Service Unions pained over arbitn., but will prob. confine themselves to protests.  Industrial Unions less pained over doctrine &amp; seem to be going pretty slow.  M. rate are we to breach agreement?  Must consider that.  Mtg. Thurs. Employers’ Confedn. have circulated all members, urging them to resist claims.  Test will be on Electricians’ claim.  Generally, Unions don’t seem to be in a hurry for trouble.
	Planning.  Moderate T.U. leaders were most outspoken : but promised to consider.  Alternative proposals.  Looks as tho’ T.U.’s will co-operate. Employers are enthusiastic.
	Must maintain momentum.  Propose to put my 2nd alternative to both sides, in writing, by end/September.  Will take some time to build up the “offices”, but a good deal of work cd. be done in m’while by W’hall.  Wd. involve abolition of COPPI. and Planning Board, but I wd. keep N.P.A.C.I. and the other thing.

R.M.	Right approach.  Deprecate over-reference to Monnet.
	Troubles ahead in motor industry – not adapting itself to increasingly seasonal variation in demand.
	Imports – grain &amp; steel dropping.  Exports not rising enough – heavy cost of financing to a problem.  We need system for cheaper money for exports.  B/E., Ty. &amp; B/T. working on this.

Hail	Ty. shd. consider how to bring Research Counils into planning machine because effect on technological development in industry.

J.H.	Won’t get consultn. before Tory Conference it cn. not wait until end Sept.  Meeting of E.P.C. this week.


	7.	Teachers’ Salaries.

D.E.	Teachers strongly v. legn. because fear general powers.
	Have stood firm on £42m. and operation date.  Also rejected suggn. of post-dated cheque for the remainder, after the pause.
	C.C.A. have suggested tht. teachers might take £42m. if I w’draw insistence on differentials.  This means taking money from graduates &amp; giving it to young women.  Quite wrong : but it might avert trouble.  Prestige : Minister can settle sum : but can’t settle its distribution.

J.M.	Hope Minister will stand firm – as we did in Scotland.

H.B.	Yes : we shd. alienate those who supported our common-sense line.
		Agreed : make no concession on differentials.
