  <content>C.C. 57(61).					19th October, 1961.

	1.	Teachers’ Salaries.	[M.R., J.A. &amp; Godber.

D.E.	My only concession was to promise not to introduce legn before Xmas.
		Their line:  no objn in principle to my proposal (subject to discn)
		so long as machinery for comparable wage negotiations is 
		applied to others.  Not too bad.

J.M.	Sc. teachers are strongly friendly and helpful.  Talks starting to find out
		underlying causes of malaise other than salaries &amp; Burnham.
		The are not in a hurry.  Prs. delaying till they see what happens in
		E. &amp; Wales.

	2.	Aviation Industry.

P.T.	Declared our policy recently &amp; in detail.  Annex A. para. 4.  On basis
		of that they have made costly &amp; painful re-organisation.  Cost			estimated then at £20 m. p.a. – we were ready to pay that price
		to have an aircraft industry.  Presume we don’t go back on that.
	But picture now is sharp run-down in [key-workers &amp; design staff].
		Total employment in industry is falling.  Ty. figures are 5 mos.
		out of date &amp; include many who aren’t making aircraft.  Factories
		are closing – no. of illustrations.  This is right:  what we intended.
		Larger run-down will follow when peak of old orders is past.  
		Worry, however, is uncontrolled run-down of [ ].  Must avoid
		that.
	Immediate need = decisions on sufft. no. of projects to enable future to
		be firmly planned.  These needed w’in 3 wks.
	I favour –	a) Helicopters.  Rotodyne:  delay verging on scandal.
		I cd. make a deal betwn. B.O.A.C. &amp; Sabena to operate Vertals
		with Br. engines.  At cost of £½ m. over 5 yrs. this wd. pave way
		for Rotodynes.  Held up for 4 months.  Also progress with
		Rotodyne.
			b) Trident  D.H. 121. for export with Medway engine.
			c) Beverley replacement.  Prs. the Belfast.
			d) Freedom to switch betwn. r and d. and developmt.,
				so tht. while we wait for order decisions we can get 
				on with useful research.
	This is minimum to enable us to appear to be followg. our policy.
		Wd show that something is moving.

S.Ll.	Glad this has come to Cab.  Commd to a policy.  Officials are at odds
		over this.  Ministers will have to decide.  H.B. will handle it for
		me.  How does it fit with D.R.P.C.?

H.W.	O.R. 351 Hastings/Beverley.  This &amp; similar projects shd. go thro’
		D.R.P.C. – tho’ I will ensure no delay.
P.T.	I accept that.

D.S.	Services must be more ready for variations of requirements to enable
		dual purpose aircraft to be produced – e.g. freighters &amp; 
		troop-carriers.

J.A.	Freighter possibility is Argosy (which we are using in R.A.F.) not
		in Beverley replacement.

H.W.	We shan’t be able to give firm decisions on numbers until defence
		policy has bn. settled.

J.A.	Air Miny view:  we can’t afford r. &amp; d. cost unless we make one
		aircraft meet 2 or 3 roles.  This wd. mean larger orders for
		each type.

P.T.	Avoid waiting for long-term decisions by concentrating now mainly
		on civil (mostly) &amp; shorter-term things.

H.B.	Propose a mtg. with Ministers before we tell officials what plans
		they are to bring forward.

			Agreed.

Hail.	We face difficult series of long-term problems.  We must protect our
		right to participate in technol. advanced industry.  But we need
		to obtain agreement of U.S. &amp; Europe tht. we can have a share 
		in world market.
	Also problem of priorities.  Projects come up in isolation.
		Nuclear ship:  supersonic airliner etc.  No machinery for settling
		this sort of thing.  Only Ty. scrutiny, limited to economic cost.

E.M.	Yes:  shipbldg. complain tht. aircraft industry get unfair share of
		Govt. aid.  Shipping interests support this.

H.B.	I could help with this.

P.T.	Wd be difficult to go back on announced policy re aircraft industry.

M.	Comparison shd. be based on amounts to be spent on industries not
		on relative merits of individual projects in each.

R.A.B.	1)	Let H.B. examine the 4 specific projects in reln
		to existg. inter-departmental machinery – mil. &amp; civil.
	2)	Take up later (Ty.) the major ques. of scientific priorities.

D.E.	I doubt if market is available for civil aircraft on scale we envisage.
	U.S. bribe their way in.  What card have we against this?  
	Shd B.E.A./B.O.A.C. continue to be separate?  Latter can’t see
future – reluctance to share our C’wealth landing rights with e.g. K.L.M.  Unless we do go into partnership with some other
	lines we can’t get market for our civil aircraft.

D.S.	We are in partnership e.g. with Quantas but it doesn’t prevent latter
	from using U.S. aircraft.
