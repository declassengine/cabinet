  <content>C.C. 12(62).					8th February, 1962.

	1.	Jamaica.			[Enter  M.R.

R.M.	Conference going well.  Date of independence, now outstanding.
		The 2 have agreed on 6/8.
	They want to continue monarchical basis.

			Agreed:  6.8.62 may be accepted.

P.M.	Admission to C’wealth.  Begin to avoid use of term ‘sponsor’.

	2.	Parliament.

I.M.	S.O. 9 debate from 7-10 p.m. may be staged to-day:  on Nuclear
		Tests.  Better perhaps than having a full debate later.

P.M.	H.W. to go first and P.M. to reply.

E.H.	Immediate debate is bad for internatl opinion.  It’s not “urgent”.
		Mr K. has said he hasn’t made up his mind.
	Hope we can tell Speaker that we wd. think this undesirable:  wd. give
		impression tht. U.K. was windy.

I.M.	Decisive vote from H/C. on same day wd. re-assure U.S. opinion.
	Also wd. get it all over in one day – before announcement in Press.
		Wd avoid build-up of opinion:  marchers etc.

E.H.	Bad debate, however, because ill-prepared.  Second prong won’t come 
		out well to-day.

			Agreed:  put issue to Speaker with bias v. need for 
				      debate to-day.

I.M.	Business for next week.
		Monopolies – shd. a cabinet member reply?
		Shipping – M/T. and H. Hallett.

	3.	Railway Wages.

S.Ll.	B. raised bid to 3%:  more guarded about further award later in year:
		also said Guilleband was guide for a good employer in funds.
		He will stand on 3%.  Unions have now asked to see P.M.

P.M.	Unwise to refuse.  Propose to accept, in lr. makg. clear tht. I can’t
		negotiate.  Shall offer to see them next week – Wednesday
		3.45 p.m.
E.M.	Must stand behind B. now:  can’t offer more than 3%.

S.Ll.	Must give them aide-memoire which can be publd.  Can’t afford to
		have misunderstandg. of what P.M. said.

P.M.	Can’t offer more than 3%.  Shd we suggest arbitn?  Shd we rather
		encourage them to look to the future:  e.g. more discn in autumn?
		Agree, however, we shd have agreed report of mtg. for publn.
		Not aide-memoire, which wd. be regarded as ultimatum.
		Cab. cd. consider a draft on Tuesday a.m.
						[Enter  D.
	4.	Kenya.

R.M.	Approachg. diff. stage.  Conference opens Wed. next.  Wd expect it to
		be followed by independence by mid. ’63.  But fears in K. are 
		growing – tribes that they will be over-ridden:  Europeans loss
		of their interests.
	Believe better to go by stages:  can’t look far ahead.  Only if Conf.
		succeeds shall I be asked to fix provisional date for 
		independence.  Not yet in posn to suggest decisions covering all 
		phases.

H.B.	Grave financial dangers.  K. heading for bankruptcy – high services/
		low taxation:  loss of confidence.  £30 m. p.a. support from U.K.
		is estimated.  Can’t guarantee to underwrite their errors after
		independence.
	Compensn for settlers.  £140 m. estimate for land alone.  Can’t say
		anything at Conf. to encourage assumptn we accept liability to
		compensate.  If we made loan to K. Govt. for this purpose, we 
		shd never be repaid.
	Only hope is to convince Africans tht. bankruptcy is inevitable unless
		confce can be restored – esp. of Eur. settlers on whom economy
		depends.

K.	Agree we must move by stages.  But end para. 8 is v. important:
		must have some external check (on analogy of U.S.).
	Para. 9.  Settlers.  Can you rely on v. ext. check to safeguard their
		rights.  If these aren’t intrenched, how m’tain settlers’ 
		confidence?  If you can’t, economy is not viable – either qua
		prodn or qua exports.  Are we ready to concede indep. to country
		whose economy isn’t viable?
	Minimum therefore = constitn which can’t be undermined by legal
		means.  Need for early review of finance/sources of revenue.
	If we can’t get constitn with these s’guards., no hope for internal
		economy to work or investment to be attracted.  What do we do
		if, at end of Confce, we believe this is posn?  We can’t hand over
		to a Govt. which has little chance of preservg. order and no			chance of avoiding bankruptcy.
H.	Why need independence follow s. govt so quickly?  Surely, this 
		time-table is too short.  Cd be extended for 1 more year.
	But more serious ques. is:  can any pol. soln be found which will
		give confidence.  Just poss., prs., if all s’guards. can be 
		secured.  But look at rpt. of offls.  ⅔rd of Eur. mght. go.  They
		contribute 50% of revenue &amp; Asians another 20% (?).  This
		suggests, not chance but certainty, of ruin.  If this were made
		known, Parlt. wd. not agree to early independence.  Shd we not
		proclaim to world what will happen if we yield it prematurely.
		Tell U.N. we are forced to stay &amp; invite their support.

R.M.	Accept financial danger.  But econ. consequences of all-out clash with
		Africans mght. be worse.

Hail.	Is not collapse quite certain if independence conceded in ’63?

I.M.	We were equally told tht. S. Cameroons wd. collapse &amp; Ch. wd. move
		in.  It didn’t happen.  Reason:  infrastructure of Br. colonies is
		sounder than elsewhere.  Adminn is good.  Danger not nearly as
		great as Congo.  We have built well.
	Date:  no commitment.  Cd be pushed to later in ’63.
	Compensation.  I have always said we wdn’t.  Paramountcy of native
		people has always bn. there.
	Much turns on wtr. Mboya emerges as leader of K.A.N.U.  (Kenyatta
		is finished.)  If he does, &amp; makes alliance with K.A.N.U., there
		is ground for hope.

R.A.B.	Much in H.’s view.  But Br. policy has remorselessly proceeded to
		implant W’minster democracy - &amp; we can’t go back on that.
	But believe we cd. insist on retaining troops.
		Fear a constitn will break down.  We must reserve power to
		resume direct rule, during period of s. govt.  Believe that shd.
		be expended &amp; full independence p’poned.

H.W.	By mid ’63 only 50% of K.A.R. officers will be African.
		Suggest we be ready to provide cost of 50% Eur. if local Govt.
		will keep them.

S.Ll.	If £30 m. p.a. aid is involved, with £25 m. of real aid:  and if forecast
		of Eur. w’drawal is sound – we cd. present this on solely
		economic basis.  Viz., independence must be delayed, not on
		pol. grds., but purely for economic reasons.

F.E.	Sure we can present convincing economic case.

I.M.	If we took that line, other countries wd. at once offer to pay the
		difference, i.e. the cost of independence.

D.	If troops are key to confidence, wd. U.N. force do the trick?

H.B.	At this stage key ques. is wtr. Eur. rights can be properly 
		entrenched in constitn – not removable short of revolution.

E.H.	Is it realistic to suppose tht. this wd. last after independence.  Only
		hope for the country wd. be strong central Govt. on Nkrumah
		model.

Hail.	Why not a longer period of s. govt. e.g. 5 years.

R.M.	Can’t take such a decision in advance.  Will depend on strength of
		pressures for &amp; against independence later on.

H.	The risks to the economy will become public at Conference
		(R.M.  Yes).  When they do, public clamour v. early
		independence.

S.Ll.	Even U.N. mght. be sensible in this case.

I.M.	$64.000 Question:  Can we govern by force in order to impose a proper
		delay on independence?  I believe not.

P.M.	Run-down of economy because lack of Eur. confidence has already
		begun.

H.	Wd U.N. under-write (not financially) a longer period of s-government.

Hail.	Cd we declare trusteeship of some kind for 5 yrs.

J.H.	Believe only hope is to prolong s. govt. under internatl tutelage of
		some kind.  [I am interested party.]

P.M.	High standard of govt. due to Eur. settlers &amp; paid for by their export
		earnings.  This must be expected to drop.

E.H.	E. African Fedn?

R.M.	Receding, now Nyerere eclipsed.

D.	Other C’wealth countries in Africa mght. covertly influence K. leaders
		to accept delay.

P.M.	Any C’wealth body overtly wd. have to press for early independence.

C.S.	If, despite econ. advantages, independent K. cd. not tolerate Br. troops,
		does it not follow they will not tolerate Eur. settlers on the 
		best land?

R.M.	Can’t retain base.  Mght. have some ‘facilities’ wh. wd. secure contd
		presence of Br. troops.

Hail.	Tho’ after independence they cd. not be used.

H.W.	Certainly not to m’tain differences of standards.  African income now
		is (average) £50 p.a.

P.M.	First outbreak of violence wd. be Somali secession.  Wd we use Br.
		troops to resist that.

H.	U.N. joint trusteeship with U.K. for 5 yrs?

R.M.	Ready to consider that.

E.H.	Wd require agreement of U.N.  Afro-Asians bound to oppose it.

Hail.	Cd we say we intended to govern for 5 more years but invite U.N. to
		associate some other countries with us.

R.M.	C.P.C. to review posn in light of atmosphere at Conference.
		M’while, consider trusteeship ideas.
		Keep in mind possibility of adjourning Conference for
			independent economic survey, by or with aid of 
			Int. Bank.  (That wd. take 12 months.)

P.M.	Endorse that as immediate aim.
