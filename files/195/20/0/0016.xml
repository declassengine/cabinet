  <content>C.C. 65(61).					23rd November, 1961.

	1.	Parliament.		[Enter  M.R.

I.M.	Business for next week.

P.M.	Coal (Borrowing Powers) Bill:  Wedy.  Will be diff. debate – both
		on prices (Scotland) and also on wages.  R.W. will need help:
		from I.M. and others:  prs. a Ty. Minister shd. speak.  Prs.
		Fin. Secy.

D.E.	Illustrates urgency of producg. Wh. Paper on wages policy.  For
		opinions are hardening on both sides.

S.Ll.	T.U.C. demand.  Propose to see them on Tuesday &amp; press on with
		machinery for planning.

P.M.	Believe this is temporary flash in T.U.C:  moderates will swing it
		round after the next meeting.

	2.	Berlin.

H.	Memo &amp; Annex written before A.’s talks with Mr.K.
	Concensus of opinion:  narrow issue of Berlin as subject for negotn.
		No evce tht. R. will continue to allow Allied access &amp; existing 
		status of W. Berlin.  But if they wd. there may be basis for a 
		deal – main diffies will be over relns betwn. W. Germany &amp;
		W. Berlin and nuclear weapons.

R.A.B.	Is it still our aim to secure re-unification?

H.	Must hold it out as ultimate prospect, in order to get W. Germans to
		look at any interim settlement.  Even R. are ready to pay
		lip-service to this.

M.	Can we envisage end of mil. occupn?

H.	Group haven’t faced this.  I wd. prefer to argue tht. our presence
		rests on invitation of W. Berlin authies – not conquest.

Hail.	Unrealistic – i)	looks for improvement of access.
			   ii)	unchanged source of Allied rights – i.e. conquest.
	Much of memo. turns its back on realities.
			   iii)	exclusion of E. German traffic from an international
				      autobahn.

H.	Our time-table:  to get a Western posn before N.A.T.O. mtg.  Reason
		to hope that R. will wait for that.
P.M.	Attitude of de Gaulle.  May be influenced by A.’s talk with Mr K.

			Agreed:  persevere in attempt to negotiate.

	3.	Malaya.

D.S.	Talks with Tunku successful.  Agreed to establish commission to 
		ascertain wishes of peoples of Borneo territories.  Agreement 
		on defence wh. secures our objectives – use of Singapore base.
		Special advantage of incldg. words “S.E.A.”.
	Agreed to make it clear in statements tht. i) we wd. not transfer this
		base to others, e.g. S.E.A.T.O.  ii) we shd. be free, however, to
		use it for S.E.A.T.O. purposes.  Tho’ Tunku may well say we
		can’t.  Main point is tht. it is agreed we can use it for what we 
		regard as protection for S.E.A.  Don’t make it more difficult
		for him.

H.W.	Also they will discuss means of taking over our I.S. commitment.

	4.	Europe:  Common Market.

E.H.	Brussels Mtg.  Statements of Six were reasonable fr. their angle:  did
		not reject our proposals re C’wealth, tho’ they asked about
		duration.
	Our 2nd objective was to get negotiations going.  On this Fr. adopted
		delaying tactics via procedure.  Compromise:  i) genl. review of
		common tariff &amp; C’wealth  ii) detailed negotiation on C’wealth
		ques.  Y’day they competed i) and have started on ii) – with
		manufacturers from Canada.
	Geneva mtg:  E.F.T.A.  Reported on Six discussions.  Neutrals have
		now decided to apply for association – at mtg. on 15/xii.  U.S.
		posn on this, so far, is hostile.  Norway likely to apply in Jan.
		for full membership.  Portugal want assocn on Gk. model, leadg.
		to membership in 15/20 years.  Acceleration of tariff redns:
		Agreed tht. 5 will move in March &amp; the other 2 in Sept.

	5.	Local Government:  Greater London.

Ch.H.	L.a.’s concerned accept that changes must be made.
	Draft W. Paper accepts diagnosis of R. Commn and its
		recommendations subject to
			i)   larger boros:  33:  provisional &amp; subject to consultns
			ii)  educations:  a central area of 2 m. populn.
	I.M.’s points.  No objn to (a).  Accept (b):  wd. involve a one year
		p’ponement of next elections for L.C.C. &amp; M’sex.

R.A.B.	Consider we shd. accept R.C. findings in principle.
		But must realise it is a major pol. decision.  Oppn from Labour
		in central Ldn. and from Tories in the fringe areas.
	Education.  I wd. have preferred to settle against a Joint Board before                               
                      *	W. Paper is published. (para. 43).  Must also remember tht. this
		central l.e.a. is bound to be Socialist.
	Support 33 boro’ concept.
			Subject to * I support this W. Paper.

D.E.	I wd. have preferred joint Bd. or direct election.  People elected to
		Greater Ldn. council mght. not be interested in education.

I.M.	Despite repns made to me, I agree we shd. do this.
		Wd have preferred to accept R.C. on boros., to avoid charge of
		gerry-mandering.  But forced to admit force of Dpt.’s 
		arguments to contrary.

D.S.	Add summary of powers wh. wd. be exercised by the various
		authorities.

H.B.	Ready to accept education plan as in W. Paper – subject to one point
		only.
	Quoted from R.C. report on need for boros. to have some hand in
		education.  Is it right to exclude e.g. Chelsea &amp; Hampstead from
		education of their children.  Want therefore to insert some 
		promises of associating them in some way in this.

Hail.	The 2 m. plan weakens the case for the general scheme.
	Wd prefer a two-tier plan for education – overall planning authy with
		adminn by boros.

Ch.H.	This part of R.C. report was hotly criticised by educationists.
		Of course, from l. govt. angle it wd. be preferable.
	Joint board.  V. unpopular in l. govt.  Members become remote both
		from electors and from boros. they represent.

H.B.	Strong appeal to publish &amp; allow p. opinion to express itself.

K.	Adminn of justice.  Not sure it will be left untouched.
		Some changes in P.S. Divns.  M’sex Sessions.  Re-organisation 
                    x/		of Ldn. Sessions.  Wd prefer to add a para. saying this will need
		considn.
			Agreed.

I.M.             y/	I wd. also want to draft a para. on my (a).

			Agreed:   Ch.H., in consultn with I.M., K. &amp; R.A.B. to
				       draft para. covering x and y/.

	6.	Wages Policy.

J.H.	Can I tell Party Cttee that it wd. be wrong to take power to fix
		wages in natd indies.

P.M.	V. large change in character of natd industries.  Wd have to be
		considered as a general ques.
