  <content>C.C. 55(61).					10th October, 1961.

	1.	Foreign Affairs.		[Enter  M.R.

                   a)	Syria.
H.	Nasser won’t oppose admn to A. League or U.N.  We can therefore
	recognise, in assocn with some others.

                   b)	Laos.
	Princes have met &amp; recognised Souv Phouma as P.M.  But the King
	has said he won’t have him : this may be passing tantrum:  hope so.

                   c)	Congo.
	Tsoumbe has sent message to Adula suggesty. delegn to Elizabethville:
	&amp; Adula has sent positive reply.

                   d)	U.N.
	R. hardened on Sec-Genl. (unitary) &amp; are falling back on Troika

                   e)	Berlin.

H.	President &amp; R. another mtg. Gromyko.  As result G. has agreed to 
		further round of bi-laterals with U.S. – prob. in Moscow.
		Alternative of early F.M. Mtg. wd. not have bn. acceptable to
		France.
	No other recent developmts.  I will circulate memo. to bring Cab. up
		to date.

P.M.	I was uneasy:  ‘phoned to President K.  Have advised him to try to
		bring Germans round – Fr. more likely then to follow.
		Hopeful tht. French haven’t reproached R. for going rather
		beyond agreed W. line.  Handicapped until A. forms a Govt.

H.	U.S. spokesmen in Moscow must have views of W. Govts.  on main
		points – suggd therefore mtg. of officials for this purpose, to 
		clear U.K./U.S. views with Fr. and G.

	2.	U. Nations:  Resolution on Colonialism.

P.M.	Discussed with Ministers concerned wtr. Nigeria shd. be encouraged
		to submit moderate resolution on Colonialism in Africa.
		Independence by 1970 – broadly in accord with our aims.
	Agreed we shd. give broad support to this, as preferable to more
extreme resoln which R. &amp; others wd. favour.  Useful to divide Afro. Asians.
					[Enter  Att.G. &amp; E.B.

	3.	Commonwealth Immigrants.

R.A.B.	Will be awkward.  Will be seen to be aimed at colour, tho’ in form
		applicable to all.  But strong pressure for it.
	Flexible – because of class (c);  but will give control.
	Reluctantly concluded this is now inevitable.
	Resoln on this to-morrow at Party Confce:  must reserve announcement
		of legn until Q. Speech.

K.	For 6 months we have recognised “sad necessity”.  Risk of social
		tension:  redn in housing standards.  These outweigh C’wealth
		sentiment and econ. advantages of col. man-power.
	This will give control over flow – no dramatic redn.

D.S.	Welcome this Bill.  Better to face criticism once for all, rather than
		risk series of incidents.
	Want liberty to tell Dom. Govts in confidence, as soon as possible.

P.M.	Take care to avoid leaks.

Att.G.	Is it necessary to imply at Party Conference tht. we are going to act.

D.S.	Embarrassing to me – before I have consulted Dom. Govts.

K.	Form of Bill.   Enabling Bill wd. be even more controversial.

E.B.	Econ. advantage in having this man-power.  Economically
		indefensible to cut it down to a trickle.  Don’t therefore imply
		tht. (c) will be small.

J.H.	Agree:  categ. (c) is weak spot:  constant pressure to disclose what
		our quota shd. be.

Att.G.	Deportn:  extension beyond 5 yrs. to be discussed.

P.M.	Party Conference.  Say no announcemt. until we have communicated
		with other C’wealth Govts, - still in process of consultn with 
		them.  M’while only preliminary indication to C’wealth Govts.
						[Exit  Att.G.
	4.	Ghana.

D.S.	Joint communiqué may be of some use – esp. on Colonial Policy.
	But recognise this has only papered over cracks.  We must continue
		to consult – to avoid things becoming worse.
	Nk. doesn’t want to go over to Communist bloc, but wants to get best
		of both worlds.
	Point for discn:  Queen’s Visit.
		a) Safety   b) Political.  On b. no doubt she will have warm 
			welcome &amp; that cancellation wd. ruin our relns with 
			Ghana.  Thus a. is the more important.
	Went into a. with gt. care.  Got from Nk. tht. if there were 
		disturbances anywhere, Queen wd. not be asked to go there.
		Fr. others I got re-assuring re-actions.  Head of Sp. Branch
		(Irishman) was clear tht. recent events hadn’t increased risks.
		Jacks. also saw no increased danger.  Leading Br. business men
		(while thinking timing unfortunate politically) agreed no 
		abnormal security risk.
	No grounds therefore for advising Queen now to change her plans.

P.M.	Tour includes also S. Leone, Gambia &amp; Liberia.  Cdn’t drop Ghana
		alone:  would have to find excuse for cancelling whole tour.

CLOSED UNDER THE
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT 2000
	Wise to reduce as much as possible occasions on which Queen drives
		with Nkrumah.

H.	Distasteful tht. Queen shd. have to associate publicly with a man like
		Nkrumah.
P.M.
CLOSED UNDER THE
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT 2000
Hail.	Pol. disadvantages of cancellation outweigh those of going.

			Agreed:  inexpedient to cancel.

	5.	Malaya.

D.S.	Greater Malaysia is best hope of containing Singapore – which, if it
		became independent on its own, wd. prob. go Communist.
	Looks now as if Tunku will come to London.  Singapore favour talks.
		We must welcome them, while preserving posn of peoples of
		Borneo etc., whose wishes wd. need to be taken into a/c.

P.M.	Agree – try to get Tunku to come for these talks.

H.W.	There will be diffy in H/C. over Singapore base.

H.	Avoid commitment to consult peoples of Borneo territories –
		referendum etc.

	6.	B.T.C. Hotels.

E.M.	As in memo.  Beeching is firm in this opinion:
		i)	physical diffy of splitting premises.
		ii)	£150.000 p.a. savings on common purchases &amp; £100.000
				on m’tenance.
		iii)	T.U.’s wd. prefer it – negotiating machinery.
		iv)	trust Beeching’s judgment.
I wd., however, include safeguards – separate organn, no power to create new separate hotel holdings, power to Minister to direct them to sell, provn for company to sell free-standing hotels.

M.	Reasons are compelling for change of policy.
E.B.	Ty. agree:  reasons for over-riding B. are not strong enough.

R.A.B.	Merits transcend Tory philosophy on this.

P.M.	Wd like to be sure this doesn’t mean they will continue all the hotels,
		good or bad.  Some sites of bad hotels cd. be developed for 
		other purposes.

E.M.	Minister will have power to give directions on this.

	7.	Council of Europe:  Social Charter.

E.B.	Can’t take Art. 12.  But enough to ratify w’out that.

			Approved.
