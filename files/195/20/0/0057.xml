  <content>C.C. 32(62).					10th May, 1962.

	1.	Parliament.		[Enter  M.R.

I.M.	Business for next week.

	2.	Foreign Affairs.

	a)	Laos.

H.	Serious break of cease-fire nr. Ch. frontier.  No evce tht. Ch. troops
		intervened.  Royal troops tho’ numerous ran away at once.
		Commr is going to P. Lao H.Q. to-day to meet them &amp; Phouma.
		Macdonald happens to be there – none of Laotian leaders is in
		the country – and it will be up to him to keep things quiet.  Some
		signs tht. Phoumi is giving way to U.S. pressure.  No genl. wish
		to resume civil war on full scale.

	b)	Congo.

H.	A. &amp; T. talks adjourned.  Gardiner (U.N.) talking to T:  hopes tht. T.
		may be ready to return &amp; settle – at end of this week.
	On other hand mercenaries are returning to Katanga in some strength.
		Airfield at Kolwezi being enlarged &amp; bomb-proof pen being
		built.  U.N. Commn wishing to inspect is being stalled off.
	Cttee – U.S./U.K./Belgium:  in return for federal constn, T. to cough 
		up revenue.  B. Govt. have agreed to Cttee:  must be secret.  
		Agreed soln might be given to Sec-Genl. to put across.  (This 
		arises from W’ton talks.)

P.M.	If we cd. get tripartite agreement on aim, it wd. be great advance.

H.	Yes:  but care over U.S. disposition to impose agreed policy.

	c)	N.A. Council.

H.	Buried  i) N.A.T.O. deterrent  ii) M.R.B.M. plan.  Satisfactory.
		We substituted plan for Nuclear Cttee thro’ which U.S. can tell
		others their prepns &amp; plans.  This will help in next stage – getting
                   x/		more reasonable strategy, balancing nuclear &amp; conventional.
	Political side.  Tensions because of Col. policies of Dutch &amp; 
		Portuguese.  Informal talk with P. For. Minister:  warned him no
		likelihood of help in Colonies:  he was not disposed to review
		Treaties:  but agreed to talks thro’ dipl. channels.

H.W.	Defence:  making some progress.  But x/ contain many unresolved
		problems.

	d)	Disarmament.

H.	R. want to adjourn on 1/6.  Clear they don’t want serious talk now.
		We and U.S. propose to decline adjournment and continue until
		Aug. – seriously comparing U.S. and R. plans.

P.M.	For some time therefore it will be mere propaganda exercise.

	3.	Oversea Aid.

S.Ll.	With b/p. improvement increased pressure must be expected.  Cab.
		shd. therefore see scope of commitment totally.
	For multi-lateral arrangemts. we shall be under heavy pressure.
	C’wealth.  Most urgent is Nigeria.  But Kenya will be inescapable.
		Fedn will need a good deal.
	F. countries.  Egypt:  have got contns from U.S. &amp; Fund:  want some
		from us.  If we don’t, trouble with our investments there.  If we
		do, can’t refuse requests from others e.g. Turkey etc.

R.M.	May need money to get settlement in Aden.  Yet it’s E. that is making
		trouble for us there.

H.	Cd you not make loan conditional on better behaviour in Aden?  Some
		suggn tht. E. now wants to turn to West.

E.H.	E. For. Minister understands tht. outstandg. ques. must be resolved 
		before loan:  but wd. not want two made inter-dependent 
		publicly.  Also his latest figures are better.  Brely’s??? talk y’day.						[Exit  E.H.

	4.	Industrial Dispute:  Docks.		[Enter  J.P., Att.G.

J.H.	Explained reasons for break-down in negotiations y’day morning.
	Statement issued by Govt. last evening with P.M.’s approval.
	G. Brown last p.m. pressed me to intervene, saying diffy was v. small.
		Suggesting Govt. statements etc., are provocative:  Govt. are
		putting all their pressure on T.U.
	Saw G. Woodcock 9.a.m. today.  He stressed small difference &amp; asked 
		if we were trying provoke a strike:  I said we had not influenced
		employers.  He was anxious tht. Cousins shd. not invoke 
		T.U.C.  Promised him we wd. consult him re use of troops.
		He suggd I shd. see leaders, separately.
	I seek guidance on 2 pts.  i) If employers want compromise &amp; suggest
		3¼ - 3½% in all, shd. they be discouraged?  ii) If employers
		don’t move upwards themselves, am I to suggest it?  In any event
		unwise for me to “conciliate”, from my Dpt., in view of wages
		policy.
	Troops.  To be efficient on Mon., want to have recce parties Fri. a.m.		I’m against that.  Don’t want them to be seen until all negotn
		is over.  Avoid provocation.

S.Ll.	More to gain (incomes policy) by standing firm.  Don’t therefore 
		do (ii).  On (i), more room for doubt:  but inclined to think offer
		already made is too high.  Wd it appear tht. they were acting in 
		concert with Govt?

P.M.	70.000 dockers.  About 50% or less are on time-rate at any given time?

J.H.	50% of cost is on time:  but less men are on time.

P.M.	Well:  majority are on piece-rates:  they have accepted 3%.
	Time rate:  5½ days at 32/10.  1/= p.day = 3%.  1/6 (demanded) = 
		4.5%.  The 6d in dispute therefore represents another 1.5%.
	Apparent anomaly:  piece-rate workers who draw more earnings have
		had 3% increase offered &amp; have accepted it.

I.M.	Cousins’ action is direct challenge to Govt., - as before.  Must be
		resisted .  Clear therefore tht. we don’t urge employers to
		raise bid.  If employers themselves want to do so, Minister shd		(if asked to advise) discourage them – on basis tht. what they
                     y/	have offered already is on high side:  but shd. make it clear it’s
		their responsibility.

M.	I agree.

J.H.	So do I, actually.

H.W.	Troops shd. be used, initially, only for m’taining essential supplies.

R.A.B.	Agree:  tho’ we mght. want to enlarge scope later.
		We can put in 35.000 initially:  another 35.000 later if all
		training suspended.

R.M.	On y/ we shd. either discourage or say it’s their responsibility.
		Can’t say both.

H.B.	I agree.  Other trades are settling much higher &amp; we say nothing.
		We shd. stand on posn tht. it’s their responsibility.

D.E.	With a policy we have a view on average %age.  Follows we must
		have a view on who shd. have more &amp; who less than the average.
		If we believe these people are being offered too much, we ought
		to be seen to be saying so – to get p. opinion behind the policy.

Ch.H.	What about statutory duty of M/L. to conciliate?

I.M.	Discharged by conversations y’day and to-day.

J.H.	If then a strike, Cousins will seek to spread it – to markets,
		lorries etc.

D.E./P.T.	With the redn in hours from 1.1.63, total value will be 7½% of which
		3% now.  (The 1/= on time rate = 3%:  and 1/6d wd. be 3¾%.)

P.M.	Troops.  Certainly don’t have recce before weekend.  Dockers might
		back down up to Sunday p.m.  Don’t need 100% efficiency from
		dawn on Monday.
	No Proclamation until Mon. a.m.  Don’t move troops in advance of
		that.  They can come in on Tuesday.

I.M.	We have known for weeks tht. this threat was over us.  We shall look
		weak if there isn’t prompt movement on Mon. a.m.  Agree no
		action until after Saty;  but no delay until after that.

S.Ll.	Move them up on Sunday p.m., when their demonstrations are over.

J.P.	What about recce?  We need to send 30 people, in plain clothes,
		while men are still working.
	Advance parties:  to “billeting” areas, to make preparations.  Wd like
		them to go on Saty &amp; move troops fwd. on Sunday.  In first
		phase, they will be accommodated in mil. establishments
		Tho’ they won’t go near the docks, they will be seen to be
		moving.

			Agreed:  {  Recce parties (plain clothes) on Saturday p.m.
				      {  Advance parties Saturday p.m. or Sunday p.m.
				                as necessary &amp; troop movements (Sunday).

S.Ll.	If employees had accepted the offer, we ought (on form) to be 
		protesting against decision.  Inconsistent therefore not to 
		discourage employers from offering more, in this case.

H.B.	Still think we shd. have it with employers.  Otherwise we shall be said
		to have caused this strike.  And we can’t fight it effectively if
		public opinion is against us.

D.E.	We shall have to be ready to say tht. settlement (this or any other) is 
		out of line with our policy.

J.H.	Enough for me to state the facts – which will show 7¼% not 2½% -
		clear enough that this is out of line.
	Will suggest to employers tht. they bring this out in Press – now.

Ch.H.	What am I to say m’while?  If I say this goes beyond incomes
		policy, Govt. is taking sides in the dispute.

P.M.	State facts and let people draw own conclusions.

Ch.H.	Can’t avoid answering ques:  what is Govt. view?

I.M.	I can state facts &amp; say I am going no further in individual case now
		under negotiation.
S.Ll.	Tho’ at some stage we shall have to express disapproval – otherwise
		rlwaymen. must get 5% or more.

H.	What answer will J.H. give if Opposn ask him why he won’t appoint
		a court of enquiry?

J.H.	V. awkward.  Must think about it.

F.E.	Troops.  Can exports have 1st priority?

P.M.	This must be worked out over next few days.

R.A.B.	Unloading foodstuffs must come first.		[Exit	J.P.

	5.	Incomes Policy:  Nurses.		[Enter  E.P.

E.P.	Propose to let Council start discussing an ultimate solution, on basis
		that it might have to be implemented by stages.	
						[Exit  E.P.
	6.	Shipping.

E.M.	i)	U.S. policy of flag-discrimination.  To get their trade in 
			U.S. bottoms.
	ii)	U.S. attempt to regulate liner conferences.
			Bonner Act restrictions.  Our line:  i) no country can alone
			control international conference:  ii) Act is to be 
			administered in interests of U.S. Commerce (esp. shipping).  
			Maritime Bd. in U.S. can under this Act make life 
			impossible for foreign shipping.  European Ministers of 
			Shipping are trying to evolve collective policy in respect of
			this – Scandinavians are dragging on this.  Brought to a
			head by demand for documents:  I have told our cos. not 
			to produce them:  Bd. maintains their demand.  Risk of
			show-down in some court.

Att.G.	28/2/62 was last time I heard of this.  F.O., were considering wtr. this
		cd. be referred to Internatl Court.
	Repns were successfully made about this sort of thing some years ago
		in context of anti-terror legislation.  V. large ques. of principle.
		If we can’t succeed by persuasion, our only remedy is recourse
		to Internatl Court.
H.	I wd. like F.O. to examine this with Att. Genl. and M/T.

Att.G.	I shd. like further factual informn.

H.	P.M. has sent memo. to Mr K.

		Agreed:	F.O. to initiate considn with Att.G. &amp; M/T.
				Take a/c. of work in progress by officials.

	7.	Incomes Policy:  Probation Officers.

R.A.B.	We appointed Cttee to re-phase their pay.  We proposed to suspend
		this &amp; give only 2½%.  Employers have declined to toe the
		line &amp; offered 10%.
	There will be a row over this.
