  <content>C.C. 10(62).					1st February, 1962.

	1.	Parliament.		[Enter  M.R.

I.M.	Business next week.
		Monday:  U.N.  P.M. and E.H. to speak.

	2.	Nuclear Tests.

P.M.	Agreed with Mr K. text of statement.  Wd have bn. make this week.
		But have bn. trying to get France associated with it.  Must get
		it out next week – want it to cover our Nevada test.
	On veto:  we have devised formula:  neither govt. wd. stand in way
		of the other.

	3.	Common Market.

E.H.	Articles in Times &amp; Guardian will be taken to reflect offl. view –
		acceptance of delay.  Incorrect.  Moreover, we have succeeded in
		getting acceleration, of offl. discussions.  We don’t accept delay:
		we don’t agree they shd. settle agricultl policy first &amp; alone.
	Will Ministers, if asked, deny these inferences &amp; put emphasis the
		other way.  We will give guidance from F.O. – to Press and to
		Govts. of Six.
	Out of date:  danger now removed:  in work of last 2 days.

D.E.	Can we have memo. showg. what policy of Six on agriculture is.

E.H.	Offl. text won’t be available until end/Feb.  But M/Ag. is working on
		provisional Fr. text.  He cd. circulate early memo.

	4.	Incomes Policy.		[Enter  R.M.

S.Ll.	Postscript to speeches in Monday’s debate.  Promised by leader H/C.
		Want to get it out to-morrow – before next phase opens.
		Contains nothing which hasn’t bn. said already.

D.E.	V. important paper.  We are trying to fix in public mind what pause
		policy is:  will condn minds of negotiators on claims etc.
	Positive side shd. be further developed.  Growth is mentioned, but not
		defined.  (French are planning effectively for 5% growth next 
		(this ?) year.)  Cd we not indicate what rewards wd. flow from
		success of this policy in U.K.  Shd not be left to N.E.D.C. – no
		substitute for Govt.  Let us define our aims.

S.Ll.	That wd. need more thought.  Want to get this out, to close negative 
		phase.  Come to positive phase a little later, strengthened by
		consultn.

H.W.	Look fwd. to it – in para. 16.
R.A.B.	Claim credit for getting N.E.D.C. off the ground.
	Success in pay pause:  figures on p. 5 of figures circulated by Ch.H.
		Wd give more colour to it.

M.	Para. 4. omit ‘restraining’ say ‘level’ vice growth.  V. depressing.
		Keep w’in productivity;  not restraint as such.

Hail.	Backward looking:  too many references to old speeches.

P.T.	Rather good memo.  Confusion in H/C. re policy:  this wd. help to
		clear their minds.

S.Ll.	Meant to be depressing.  To sustain employers.  To show we are
		encouraging restraint.  Unwise to raise excessive hopes based
		on growth, before we have got it.

H.B.	Cd add to para. 5 tht., if people tried, we cd. get production p. head
		higher.
			Agreed.

F.E.	Effective work, not hard.  Para 7. sacrifice of r. practices is wrong
		tone:  renunciation is what it is:  acceptance of modern condns.

S.Ll.	Wd J.H. now agree to omission of para. 10?

J.H.	Yes: in view of what Woodcock has said.

P.M.	On tone:  remember we have bn. in office for 10 years:  can’t afford
		to say everything is all wrong and we are in crisis.  Take credit
		for what has bn. achieved esp. in raising standards of workers.
		We have gone ahead a bit too fast:  all we need do now is to halt
		to consolidate before we go further ahead.
	Remember politics, as well as economics.

J.H.	These thoughts are for launching of N.E.D.C. – not rounding off
		last Monday’s debate.

Hail.	But don’t look so dreary &amp; drab.

Ch.H.	Narrower approach:  public need to know what we mean by the
		intermediate phase.

S.Ll.	I agree:  improve 1 &amp; 16.  Accept R.A.B. also M. on para. 4.  Also
		H.B. on 5.  F.E., too.  Omit 10.

Ch.H.	Get P.M.’s theme put across by Ministers generally over next 
		3 months.  Organised by Central Office.  Campaign is ready
		to go.
	Put P.M.’s theme, initially, when N.E.D.C. is announced
		(membership).
Hail.	Why “Intermediate”.

H.B.	The Next Phase.  The Next Step (agreed).

M.	Fear this will turn all T.U. leaders v. us:  so gloomy.

D.E.	Plight to give dose of gloom:  can’t get more than 2½% growth
		unless incomes policy is right:  but if it is got right we can do 
		much better in 1963 onwards.

D.E.	Para. 12.  Penultimate sentence.  Don’t want arbitn added to Burnham.
		Cd this be confined to ‘existing’ arrangements.

	5.	Railways:  The One-Day Strike.

R.A.B.        x/	Shd we advise employers to allow some workers not to come to work
		on Mon?  Or do we want another chaos next Mon?

M.	x/ wd. be a mistake.  Must battle v. the diffies.  Wrong phychology.

E.M.	I take opposite view.

Ch.H.	V. bad public relns to do x/.  Sharing cars is better line.

R.A.B.	Confine it to police warning not to come to Ldn. by car unless you
		have to.
							[Exit  E.M.
	6.	Northern Rhodesia.

P.M.	As in his brief.
	Explained changes made in earlier discussions with R.W.
	R.M., after visiting N. Rhodesia, put forward new proposals.  After
		much discussion with group of Ministers concerned have agreed
		to put some changes to R.W.  Shd keep race, vice roll voting: and
		Asian seat.  But criticisism has concentrated on fact tht. African
		has to get 12½% whereas European has to get only 4% of votes
		of other race.  Difficult to justify it.  We propose therefore to 
		suggest to R.W. that hurdle shd. be 4% for both or if he prefers at
		12½% for both.  If he has come to doubt wtr. his candidates will
		get any African votes, he may prefer so high a figure that 
		virtually no-one will get elected to national seats.
	Best thing for territory wd. be African majority of 1 – given that there
		are 6 off. members.  If R.W. had accepted parity when I 
		suggested it months ago, it wd. have worked in practice.
	If R.W. prefers 12½%,  he wd. be ready to abolish Asian seat.  We
		mght. substitute for this a seat for Barotseland people.
	If we stand on June proposals, both Ministers fear v. serious trouble.
		If we change them, risk tht. R.W. will level charge of breach/
		faith.  But believe we cd. justify change now envisaged.

R.M.	R.W. likely to prefer 12½% &amp; loss of Asian seat.  On 4% real change
		of a no. of Africans being elected.  On 12½% Africans will gain
		little.  But just enough to avoid v. serious violence:  or at least to
		give us moral position in which we cd. take action to suppress it.

D.S.	V. diff. issue with R.W.  The June arrangement was based on our fear
		of what R.W. could do – taking over N. Rhodesia:  effect on
		referendum in S.R.  We did therefore make a package deal with
		him.  We are bound to be charged with bad faith if we go
		back on it now.  Tho’ in Oct/Nov. we made it plain to him tht.
		some concession wd. have to be made to Africans, if we were to
		keep order there.  Two main African demands are abolition of 
		numerical alternative and Asian seat.  We must concede one:  
		But R.W. will say we have broken faith.
	How far shd. we go twds. merging this into wider issue of Fedn future?
		This is what R.W. is worrying about.  If 2 of 3 territories  have
		anti-Fedn Govts., Fedn will collapse.  My view is tht. Fedn can’t
		continue unchanged.  Is R.W. coming round to view tht. its 
		existence depends on its being acceptable to African 
		majority?  Unless he makes some dramatic move with this in
		view, Fedn will disintegrate.  Banda will begin to separate off –
		by obstructg. Fedn activities &amp; officials.  I am therefore 
		proposing to go out soon to discuss all this with R.W.  I want
		to move in direction of putting on R.W. the responsibility for
		finding basis of agreement with African leaders on future running
		of Fedn.  If I cd. convince him of that, he shd. see there is no
		point in alienating African opinion over N.R. constitution.  Can’t
		express view on that yet.  But if R.W. does explode over this
		N.R. ques., it means he won’t save Federation.
	My plan therefore is to put proposal to R.W. (on N.R.) – either before
		or when I go to see him on wider issues.  Don’t believe he will
		accept N.R. proposal save in wider context.

P.M.	Let Alport open it, with knowledge you are coming out next week.

K.	Can we be accused of breach of faith?  I conclude we can’t.  True tht.
		June proposals resulted fr. hard bargaining with R.W.  They
		were publd – I.M. supporting them.  Re-actions locally were
		unexpectedly violent.  Sept.  Col. Secy. said we wd. not listen
		to any repns until law &amp; order restored – but we committed 
		ourselves to consider these repns w’in limits of statements of
		Feb. &amp; June on 2 points now at issue.  R.M. went out:  support
		Govr.’s view tht. if we make no change violence worse than 
		Sept.  This justifies us in makg. minimum alterations necessary
		to avert bloodshed in territory for wh. we are still responsible.  
		I’m prepared to defend such a decision v. Salisbury’s attack.

R.A.B.	We really crossed this bridge when we promised in Sept. to consider
		any repns made w’in a limited field w’in which changes now
		proposed in fact fall.
	On the merits this is also a better plan.

H.	June amounted to an agreement.  But posn now is governed by Sept.
		We shd. not be at liberty to make proposals drastically different
		from June, but I don’t believe this is.
	R.W.	can’t choose 4%.  If he chooses 12½%, he can’t make 
		multi-racial policy work.  Believe therefore he will explode
		&amp; come over.
	Weakness of our posn in dealing with him.  We are always asking him
		for concessions on franchise in 2 northern territies but never tell
		him our intentions for Fedn’s future.  Can D.S. work out with 
		R.W. some practical plan for enabling Fedn to survive.  That is a
		real Br. interest.  I wd. therefore merge the 2 issues – in talks by
		D.S. in Salisbury.

R.M.	No hope for present Fedn – whatever R.W. does.  Even moderate 
		opinion in 2 northern territories is now critical of Fedn.

D.S.	I wd. sooner broach this in course of my talks on wider issues.

R.M.	Less confusing to put them thro’ Alport in advance.
		Less danger of misunderstanding.			[Exit  E.H.

P.M.	R.W. must have a clear aide-memoire of Govt. proposals on N.R.
		wtr. it is handed to him by Alport or by D.S.
	Ques. is wtr. it is handed to him in advance or during D.S. talks.
		In any event he must have it in writing before D.S. leaves.
