  <content>C.C. 66(61).					30th November, 1961.

	1.	Sir W. Churchill.	[Enter  M.R.

P.M.	Message of congratulations from Cabinet.

I.M.	Will be welcomed if he comes to H/C.

	2.	Cabinet Secretariat.

P.M.	Bishop’s departure to M/Ag.  Wish him well.

	3.	Parliament.

I.M.	Business for next week.

	4.	Congo.

H.	We abstained &amp; dissociated ourselves fr. Afro-Asian resoln.
		H/C. F.A. Cttee content with our action so far.  They fear tht.
		Sec. Genl. may still go too far.  Y’day’s violence has put back
		chances of A. &amp; T. meeting.  Tho’ latter has said he’s willing
		to have distinguished African to mediate.

	5.	Germany:  Berlin.

	(a)	Talks with General de Gaulle.

P.M.	Mtgs. of Heads of Govts. – bilateral, but no sign of multi-lateral.
	Mr K. wants to negotiate.  We are nearing to negotiatg posn – tho’
		Dr A.’s posn is too narrow.  de G. remains opposed:  for he
		fears German resentment at “another Versailles” when G.
		becomes a strong nation against, and he wants Fr. to have no
		part in that:  content to leave Anglo-Saxons to the dirty work.
		This puts us in diffy – as shown in my message.
	K. is prob. willing to wait – for a bit.

H.	Schroder says no alternative to negotn.  Looks as tho’ G. can be brght.
		along.  Essential ingredients &amp; formula for D.D.R. &amp; something
		on frontier.  Believe G. in the end will accept those:  tho’ A.
		dared says so now for fear of leaks.  N.A. Council will press for
		negotns.  Ultimate ques. is wtr. we go on w’out French.  May
		need a mtg. of W. Heads of Govts. to settle that ques.
	Where de G. is wrong is tht. sitn on the ground in Berlin is 
		dangerous.
P.M.	Will circulate records of mtg. with de G. – see and return.
	Impressions of de Gaulle.
	I mght. have bn. reluctant to press him on G. if that wd. have made
		more diff. on C. Market.  But looks as tho’ he is as stiff on that
		as on G.  This being so, we prob. risk little on C. Market by
		pressing him on G. and isolating the French.
	Au fond, de G. believed that Anglo-Saxons will avert war and he 
		will be able to say nous sommes trahis but enjoy the benefits.
	Choice for us now:  do we bring pressure from bottom up, or do
		we have a mtg. of Heads of Govts.  H. and I will consider,
		with Mr K.

	 (b)	Economic Counter-Measures.

P.M.	Summd concln.  Take note.  Remember tht. we shd. not press our
		objns so far as to weaken our influence on them over the negotns.

H.	Believe U.S. will accept a more sensible formula on embargo.  Will
		report this later to Cab.

	(c)	Military Planning.

H.W.	Summarised memo.  C. 195.
	Command in Berlin.  We shall have to accept U.S. general.  He wd. be
		under Norstadt.  Confusion is possible because of N.’s double
		role (para. 11).
	Recommendations (para. 15).

R.A.B.	Discussed in Def. Cttee y’day.
		Doubt over ‘deploy’ in 15(d):  resolved after discn in Def. Cttee.
		Does not involve commitment.

C.S.	Only 56 men?

H.W.	No:  (d) refers to whole garrison.

S.Ll.	Second half of (b)?

H.W.	It wd. give us time to intervene.
	Memo. C. 187.  Took note with approval.

	6.	Decimal Coinage.	[Enter  Macpherson.

P.M.	Let Mr Pallister speak!

S.Ll.	To our economic advantage to make this change – esp. if we cd.
		synchronise with A. &amp; N.Z.
	Recommn:  declare readiness in principle &amp; set up Commn to
		ascertain method &amp; cost.  Consultn with industry.  Time-table
		&amp; date.  Then final Govt. decn.  But admit tht. if we have 
		announced decn of principle, diff. to draw back.  On other 
		hand v. feeble to set up Commn w’out a decn of principle.

K.	Believe we may look silly.

R.A.B.	Favour enquiry – para. 22 of Officials’ report.

M.	Believe this meritable.  But don’t accept in principle.

P.T.	Support M.’s view.

Hail.	Don’t want to lose £.  Why not decimalise on basis of £.

P.M.	No decision in principle.
	But set up Commn – saying we are now satisfied tht.
		there wd. be sufft advantage in making this change
		to warrant making a full-scale investign into its cost.

			Agreed.

	7.	Wages:  Firemen.

R.A.B.	By decn of 1959? we devolved responsibility for pay to council 
                    y/		of l.a.’s.  K. (then at H.O.?) said Min. intervention wd. no longer
		be justifiable because of genl. grant.
	I have however told them it cd. be breach of pause if they awarded
		any increase before Feb. ……… [out of room].

Ch.H.	We can’t disengage &amp; on basis we have no power.  We have tried 
		that before &amp; failed.  Moreover, we have some power under
		general grant.
	Shd we not say this is pre-pause commitment because promise to Ldn.
		and M’sex.  If we don’t, we must allow Ldn. &amp; M’sex. as 
                   x/		pre-pause commitment, but express disapproval of award
		elsewhere by positive action under general grant.

J.H.	Not sure there is much of a pre-pause commitment.
		But on balance I incline to x/.

P.T.	S.Ll. will be savagely attached for anything which can be interpreted
		as breach of pause.

R.A.B.	Much concerned about y/.

P.M.	Cd say this is emergency national need which over-rides that.
		Cd we appeal to them to settle (rest of country) for Jan. 1.

Ch.H.	Add:  we regard this a pre-pause package.

M.	If we don’t get this w’in our rules, we are sunk.

I.M.	Admit Ldn. &amp; M’sex. as pre-pause.  No power to stop increases
		elsewhere, but we will adjust genl. grant so as to ensure we
		don’t make any Exch. contn towds. increases paid before 
		Jan. or Feb.
P.M.	Appeal to them to date remainder from Jan. 1.  Make it plain tht. if
		they choose a much earlier date, we shall indicate disapproval
		&amp; reserve our posn on genl. grant.

Ch.H.	If we can regard rest of country as truly consequential, we can regard
		the whole thing as pre-pause package (?).  Unless we do, other
		counties (Dec. or Jan.) will be regarded as breach of pause
		policy.

R.A.B.	Formula – for a message to Joint Council.

S.Ll.	If it has to be a  single settlement, we cd. defend a package over
		whole country, so long as not retrospective.

			After further discussion agreed tht. Secretariat shd. 
				prepare draft formula for considn.

J.H.	Send separate message to employers’ side tht. they shd. not
		encourage arbitration.

			Agreed.
					[Enter  J.A., P.M.G.
	8.	Blue Streak.

P.T.	If we drop this, we cdn’t come back into rocketry.  Case for going on
		is not scientific but mil., technological, communns.  Some hope
		of succeeding in getting European consortium.  But U.S.
		competitors try to detach members, by bribery of every kind – 
		&amp; are now concentratg. on Italy.  Believe tht, if we said we
		were going on &amp; were ready to carry Italian share, we might pull
		if off &amp; keep I. in.
	I am still £4 m. w’in the Ty. authy of months ago – 26 m.  Mght. be
		worth going to £33 m.  Keep Woomera out of this argument.
	This decn wd. enable me to get Fr. &amp; G. support to push this thro’.

H.	New German condns  a) no financial contn until convention signed.
		b) no sign. until known who else will sign.

P.T.	I wd. advise rejection of a) &amp; I believe G. wd. accept that.
H.B.	Cab. has not seen this since July ’60, when they gave authy tht. work
		shd. go on until end of ’60.  We started at 17½ m., went to 26,
		now asked for 33.  Other countries are hesitating to commit
		themselves until picture is clear.  Why shd. we?  We are not
		committed if Italy drops out.  We can’t afford to carry Italian
		share.  Continuing with this will cut us out of other projects.
		The valuable scientific elements will prob. be undertaken by
		G. &amp; others, not us.

Hail.	Commns = only potential commercial gain.  Then only if this 
		launcher is used - &amp; that seems doubtful.
	Cdn’t accept continuance of this as ground for reducg. expenditure
		on scientific projects.

H.W.	Why are U.S. trying so hard to get us out of this, unless they see
		somethg. practical in it.  Motive surely must be to break our
		communications near-monopoly.

D.S.	If we were startg. fr. scratch, we mght. not think this worthwhile.
		Can it be right to throw away now all that we have staked.

S.Ll.	Ques. for decision to-day is smaller tactical ques. – what is best way
		of getting consortium into life.

H.B.	Yes:  admit that.  My case is para. 13.

D.S.	Support P.T.  Italy more likely to come in if they think it is going
		to come off.

P.T.	France won’t carry Ital. share.  If I wait, U.S. will increase their
		efforts to buy them off.  If I say tht., if need be, we will carry
		Ital. share, I can get Fr. &amp; G. to come along - &amp; I also believe
		tht. gives best chance of getting I. in.  M’while, so long as we
		wait, we spend £35.000 p. wk.(?) on carrying on alone.

P.M.	Let P.T. have chance to make one more effort to
			bring them in on basis wh. he proposes.

			Agreed.
