  <content>C.C. 24 (62)					29th March, 1962

	1.	Security in Public Service.		[Enter M.R., Att.G.

P.M.	In view of Pincher’s article we now propose to include a version of Ch.7.

	2.	Parliament.

I.M.	Business for next week.

S.Ll.	Can H.B. wind up Budget debate?  Traditional tht. Ch/Ex. shd. do so.
Need I be bound by this?

R.A.B.	S.Ll. can decide in his discretion.

P.M.	Let Ty. Ministers consider.  But my instinct is for S.Ll. not to seem to be backing out.

	3.	The Budget.

S.Ll.	Explained our proposal to be included.

		No note taken.
				[Enter P.M.G.

	4.	Incomes Policy:  Wages Council Awards.

J.H.	Explained his position.  Tabled draft letter.

H.B.	Ministers must be seen to show disapproval by referring back – even if they are re-submitted w’out alteration.  I put this at E.P.C.  J.H. suggd stronger statement:  this is not stronger.

I.M.	Words quoted, which I need in debate, were considered statement of Govt. policy.  Line now taken by H.B. is not consistent with what I said.
Tho’ we cd. strengthen the draft answer to come nearer to H.B.’s suggn.

M.	Support I.M.’s view.

Hail.	Univ. teachers 3%:  nurses 21/2% - in order to help M/L. to hold the private sector.  But his schedule is wholly in excess of our norm.
This is indefensible.
S.Ll.	V. small propn of whole field is under our control.  We must therefore proceed by example (where we do control) or precept (where we don’t).  J.H.’s line is not sufficient precept.

J.H.	Ready to strengthen what I say to Wages Councils – but don’t want to take action wh. can’t be effective.

P.T.	We are asked either to enforce across the board or to drop it.
Our posn must be weakened if M/L. accepts these awards w’out at least askg. for re-considn.  Ask them for statement showg. how they reconcile these awards with Govt. policy they were asked to consider.

I.M.          x|	My statement said:  after 1/4.  Those in already cd. be referred back 
                   |		consistently with that.

C.S.	Our only hope is to go on saying tht. wherever we can act to secure compliance with our norm. policy, we will do so.

Att.G.	Cd you not also threaten to take power to amend awards inconsistent with Govt. policy.

J.H.	We may come to that.  But remember these are all low-paid workers.
This is a political diffy.

			General support for line at x/.

P.M.	Wd prefer to avoid statement in H/C.
	Why shdn’t. M/L. write to Councils, referring to his earlier request, pointing out danger to these workers if general policy fails, asking them to think again.  Confine this to Councils wh. have made awards, but send copy to those now considering new cases.

			Agreed.

H.	But face it, they won’t respond, and then we must legislate &amp; go much further or see our policy collapse.

P.M.G.	Referring back is not inconsistent with I.M.’s statement.  That referred to delaying operation of an award.
					[Enter J.A.
					[Exit Att.G.
	5.	Portugal.

H.	We shall be criticised.  But bearable if we cd. get the assurance they won’t be used in Angola.  We ought to be able to get that.

J.A.	They wdn’t be much use in Angola.

M.	But they aren’t useful in N.A.T.O.
All Dpts. favour save C.R.O., Admy &amp; B/T. (unless useful to N.A.T.O.).

D.S.	If aircraft were moved to Angola, no-one wd. think assurance was worth anything.

J.A.	We use Azores &amp; Cape Verdi for non-N.A.T.O. purposes – tho’ pretending the contrary.

M.	Cd F.O. discover extent of assurances we can get.

F.E.	Worth taking a risk on this.

P.M.	Not in Africa or, failing that, not in Africa save v. external
		aggression.
