	1.	Nuclear Tests.		[Enter M.R., Penney

W.Penny.	If no more tests, U.S. have slight advantage over R.
	R. have virtually drawn level overall – ahead in 100 megaton, behind in ½-1 meg of light weight &amp; latter are of gt. potential for anti-missile def.
Will take 2-3 yrs. for R. to put their new knowledge into new weapons.
They R. are surely preparing for more tests.
	Our special aspect wh. causes anxiety – 3 missiles at once at various heights – one with n. warhead – various dirns.  Clearly 1st attempt at anti-missile experiment:  one fired fr. their anti-missile research station (town of 20,000 people).
	Anti-missile.  Missile is as nearly imposs. as anythg. I have seen.  There can be decoys &amp; dummies wh. wd. make it even worse.  Also saturation v. one targets.  U.K. cdn’t afford it.  But U.S. &amp; R. are both putting gt. effort into it:  each must because the other does.  With these resources can’t say it’s impossible.
	U.S. were not ready to test:  caught unawares.  They feel they must do so now lest R. get ahead.  Significant part of their p’mme wd. be related to anti-missile defence.  If their scientists aren’t encouraged to think there will be more tests, impetus of their work will be lost.
	The 100mt. explosion.  U.S. said no mil. importance.  Up to a point, true:  smaller weapons aimed accurately cd. be as effective.  But if exploded 25m. above target, it wd. destroy it by heat:  &amp; much harder for defence to destroy it at that distance.  Makes that problem even harder.
	U.S. p’mme.   i) high-altitude explosions – 10, 50 or 100 m. up – to
                   {		measure effects esp. on radio/radar communicns.  Part of anti-missile problem effect of n. explosion on a missile – how near it must be etc., must be done in atmosph., high.
			      ii) check existg. w.heads for Polaris, minuteman &amp; Skybolt.
		All designed on basis of no further tests &amp; therefore conservatively designed.
		Tests needed to check them &amp; if poss. to reduce weight – for decoys etc.
		               iii) to reduce weight per unit of explosion:  new war-heads.  Needed both for offensive &amp; defensive purposes.
		                iv) new prospect devices – v. powerful explosives at v. small weights for anti-missile missiles.  They haven’t worked this out.  Leap ahead:  for same purpose as (iii).

Hail.	Do these meet threat of 100m. bomb?

W.P.	(i) does.
W.P.	No.  I said it wd. be more difficult to deal with 100mton:  but not impossible.
	All tests designed to reduce weight wd. be preparatory to elaboration of a defence.
	No anti-missile system likely in less than 10 years.
	No barge or surface tests at Xmas (U.S. agree).

C.S.	Wd delay of 3 more months be serious.

W.P.	 No prob.; but they think so.  What they fear is that, if R. went on without further U.S. tests, R. wd. get a lead.  If I were an American, I fear I wd. have to advise President to go on. The U.S. will test, wtr. they get Xmas or not.

D.E.	Pollution?  

W.P.	V. little:  much less than previously.

Hail.	What money will U.S. have left for aid etc.

W.P.	Their potential is so large that they will manage both.
	The U.S. have no alternative but to go on.

P.T.	1st para. of  Principles (N.C.C.A.8) wd. get us over diffy tht. decision wd. be U.S. decision. 
	Safety:  can U.K. have final say – as Austr. have at Maralinga.

W.P.	We can lay down the safety rules:  but U.S. want to have decn w’in those rules tho’ they will have B. subject on safety cttee.
		Can’t say condns in Xmas are the same as at Maralinga.
						[Exit Penney.

I.M.	The U.S. intend to do it.  They are right to do it.  (W.P.).  This means we must support them.  Surely therefore allow them to have Xmas Island.

P.M.	We and U.S. are the 2 W. n.powers., in a joint enterprise.  Let us defend this as joint enterprise – we jointly agree a p’mme of tests 
                 x		is necessary to preserve balance/deterrent – to wh. we contribute 
                  		Xmas Island &amp; our experts etc.   But let us add, Mr K. and I, tht. which this is justifiable, it isn’t good enough:  we must make a further effort to break through.

H.B.	But wd. the initiative then be made – wd. Mr K. agree to make it &amp; wd. K. agree, knowg. tht. W. testing is going to start.

R.M.	At what other moment cd. we decide to test?  Not when disarmament discns were going on.

H.	R. &amp; U.S. have agreed on the Confce.:  U.S. &amp; R. plans on paper are not dissimilar:  n. tests come early in that plan.

P.M.	New plan at x/. will avoid risk that at some later date we shd. differ fr. U.S. in their view of pol. ques. wtr. situation has so far improved as to warrant p’ponemet of testing.

D.S.	Don’t make offer of Xmas Isl. condl on their joining in initiative etc., say, if you like, that if it can’t be joint we may have to try it ourselves.

	2.	Indonesia.

H.	Sokarno has now said we will attack.   He is said to be mobilised.
	But Dutch y’day said they wd. negotiate w’out pre-condn re self-determn.  That shd have improved posn.
	Suggd tht. U.Tant shd. mediate.  He wd. be acceptable to Indonesians.
	No case therefore for P.M. to write to P.M./Holland.	   [Enter Machperson
	Arms to Indonesia.  Suggn in memo. we shd. delay deliveries.

M.	Figures in Annex. not accurate.   More torpedoes.  Also (Annex B)
	Vickers have definite contract for June.  Risk of breaches of contract.
	Cttee on Export of Arms shd. consider position and report.

P.T.	Don’t act precipitately. 
	2 Gannets already handed over in U.K.  Suggest we don’t try to stop them flying these out.

P.M.	M. to consider in detail, qua character of weapons and also delivery dates.  Each item can be dealt with by export licensing.

N.M.	In many cases the licences have bn. granted.

P.M.	Specially quick look at Gannets.

P.M.	Logistic support.  Why not wait till asked.

H.	They will – pretty soon.  Luns is always asking.

D.S.	Austr. are anxious not to be asked to give such support themselves.
	Singapore:  effect on G.Malaysia if it cd. be said tht. we were using it for Colonial purpose.

H.	We can stall for a bit.
			Agreed.

P.M.	Don’t let’s incur all the odium when we know Dutch won’t put up determined resistance.

Hail.	Has a man of war a right to re-fuel?

P.M.	If so, no (or less) harm.

H.	Will look into this.

H.	On 4 (iii) we shd. have to vote in U.N. against Indonesia.
						[Exit N.M.
	3.	Congo.

H.	T. has had good mtg. with U.N. civil &amp; mil. authies.  Assembly will prob. meet at E’ville to-day &amp; give sufft support to Kitona agreement &amp; authorise K. Repves to participate in commn to review constitution.
	Less happy over U.N. plans for action if this breaks down.  Also U.S./U.N. plan to squeeze economic life out of K.
	M’while U. Tant has asked thro’ us for observers in N. Rhodesia.  We are suggestg. to R.W. tht. he shd. offer to receive high repve of U.N. to see what frontier arrangemts. have bn. made.  He may agree to invite U.T. or his repns for this purpose.

K.	Are we or Fedn responsible for this sort of thing?

D.S.	Observe.  But R.W. cd. argue tht. we have devolved respons. for external affairs save when it affects our responsibilities.

H.	This is almost wholly movement in &amp; out of Fedn – wh. is Federal responsiby.

	4.	Laos.

H.	Princes have disagreed &amp; Phouma has left for Paris.  Before doing so, he put a Govt. on paper, which U.S. can support.  Phoumi broke up the mtg.:  U.S. have decided to disown him unless he accepts.  They have sent to King threatening w’draw their support unless Phoumi comes to heel.  If this fails, Grom. &amp; I will have to summon Phoumi to Geneva.
	Danger is tht. fighting will now break out again.  We shd. then be in real diffies.
	Maddening, now we have reached agreement with R. &amp; Chinese.
