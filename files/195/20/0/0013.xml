  <content>C.C. 62 (61)					14th November, 1961

	1.	Foreign Affairs.		[Enter M.R.

H.	a) Berlin. Kroll’s approach is being repudiated by Fed. Govt.  But he may have known tht.  A. wd. not mind much.  Wait now for W’ton.
	b) Congo.  T. has declined to go to see Adoula at Leopoldville – fears for his life.  A. won’t meet him outside Congo.  Deadlock.  Thought of conciliator being mooted – Spaak – doubtful.  M’while another resoln in U.N. – Afr-Asians favouring forcing Adoula’s policies on T.
Can’t support their extreme resoln:  cd. hardly veto:  seeking a more moderate alternative.  India/Ceylon have a draft which is not too bad but wd. envisage more force for U.N.  Party unhappy over that.
Will report further on Thursday.

Hail.	If T. is overborne by U.N., it will ruin chances of multi-racialism in neighbouring countries.  Wd be intolerable to H/L.

I.M.	Danger of Adoula losing out to Kisenga.  Not surprised he won’t meet T. outside Leopoldville.  Cd they meet in Embassy there?

H.	Doubt if T. wd. feel safe even in an Embassy in Leopoldville.  But we can try that.
             x|	Welensky agrees tht. Katanga has no future as independent &amp; best chance is for T. to join with A. so as to put K. into clear minority.
	U.N. asking us for bombs to use in Canberras supplied by India.
Difficult to refuse.  Cd we grant on condn they don’t use (?).

Hail.	Cdn’t defend that.

D.S.	Diff. to refuse request from U.N.

P.M.	Let them get the bombs from India, whence they got Canberras?
	Dilemma.  Remember origins – we feared R. wd. move in, and supported U.N. to prevent that.  We welcomed a force.
Are we now to say it’s bn. badly handled:  parties muse be left to come to terms:  can’t allow U.N. to conquer the rebels:  U.N. shd. therefore w’draw.  This wd. pave way for K. &amp; communists to gain power, &amp; create great C. controlled state in centre of Africa.
We shd. remind Party tht. this is our objective.  Welensky’s view X. is realistic.  He thinks this is T’s last chance of getting federal system.
	Some argue tht., if no agreement w’out U.N. pressure, the pressure wd. be justified to bring off the meeting.  There is no future in Katanga independence.
D.S.	If fear of assassination is T’s only fear, that cd. be overcome.

H.	He also distrusts Adoula generally - &amp; is open to influence of those who don’t want union.
	Best hope is to get Sec. Genl. to suggest Embassy, rivér, conciliator – in hope tht. one may be acceptable.

H.W.	Cd R.W. explain his view to Party?

H.	He has done.

H.	True Br. interest (because our investments mainly in A’s part) is to strengthen A. to force T. to come in.  But v. dangerous to allow U.N. to use force.  U.S. wd. be disposed to favour a more extreme resoln.
Suggest small mtg. of Ministers when text of resoln is available.

P.T.	Can we act diplomatically with T. (instead of thru’ U.N.) – jointly with R.W., U.S. &amp; Belgians – warning him not to use aircraft, or he will provoke forceful U.N. action.

H.	Have tried this – no success.  T. is surrounded by Belgian millionaires who tell him not to pay any attention.

P.T.	Offer Br. or U.S. bodyguard.  

S.Ll.	A. wd. regard that as breach of sovereignty.

H.W.	As agents of U.N?

S.Ll.	They can’t use a Gt. Power – R. wd. insist on participn.  Alternative:  get U.S. to declare with us tht. financial support will cease if T. suffers any hurt.

P.M.	For our immedte diffies wd. suit us if nothing happened on a resolution.
But long-term this wd. mean tht. A. &amp; D. lose out to K. - &amp; then our main objective is lost.

R.A.B.	Don’t give bombs to U.N.  Party wd. not stomach that.

H.W.	Will seek technical excuse to delay this.

	3.	Nuclear Tests.

P.M.	Mr.K. has made statement on Nov. 1. – criteria same as mine, but added his last sentence.  When he considers prepns, finds both his sites are in Trust territories – we wd. give U.N. locus standi to object.  He therefore asked me is he cd. use Xmas Island.  M’while we have had to ask for underground test (Skybolt) in his facilities:  and he has agreed.
	Public pressures – in U.S. for resumption:  in U.K. against it.
	Xmas is under care/m’tenance at £1/2m a year:  300 R.A.F. personnel and 60 natives.  4-6 mos. to re-activate.
	U.S. experts; picture of tests likely – alarming – 24 explosions totalling 10 megatons.  Can’t tell yet wtr. Mr.K. wd. think this sort of thing to be “necessary.”
	Prepns on Xmas cd. not be covert.  Diff. to p’pone until main decision taken.  Pressures wd. build up, however, when we start.
V. awkward.
	Tel. conversation with Mr.K.

H.W.	Saw Brown, who is willing to accept tighter criteria than A.E.C.
We shd. need 10 days or so to sort that out.

H.B.	Support 7(a).

R.A.B.	Why can’t they use their own territory – or ships. 

I.M.	Agree.

H.W.	Clear advantage to us of joint testing.

Hail.	Out object in reducg. U.S. tests to minimum is best achieved by putting U.K./U.S. rules of necessity.  Join in therefore for this purpose.

H.	Presentation.  R. tests may have put them ahead.  We may need more tests.  Prepare for necessity in case it arises.

R.A.B.	Don’t believe West shd. resume testing at all. Disliked P.M.’s statement.  Prefer U.S. to do it alone.

D.E.	If U.S. have enough already, hard to convince our public tht. they need any more tests.

P.M.	Mr.K. as friendly but more negotiable – clearer mind &amp; stronger character.  E. was much more under influence of advisers. 
V. satisfactory.  But I don’t want any misunderstanding with him.
	Not happy about going for scientific criteria.  We may be pushed too far on that line.
	Don’t want to go along and then draw back.
	What of message on lines of para 6 of brief.  i) to iii)  But stress iv) including [].  Tho’ I wd. regard it as a terrible blow to Anglo-U.S. relations.  Add (v), (vi) and (vii).  Cd have preliminary discn betwn. experts to define more precisely what is proposed.  Then aim at main decision when we both meet - &amp; no overt preparations at Xmas I. until then.

Hail.	Channels to U.S.  Don’t upset A.E.A./A.E.C. channel.

H.W.	Our r.&amp;d. generally is increasingly dependent on U.S. co-operation.

P.M.	Will prepare draft, for further consideration.
					[Enter P.M.G.
	4.	Post Office Giro System.

P.M.G.	Explained proposal.

R.A.B.	On balance favoured publn to test public opinion.
But surprised at strength of Bank’s re-action.

I.M.	Why madden the Banks before we know what we intend.

M.	I am opposed to everything.

H.B.	Banks opening 10-3pm are not much use to workers.
Ty. believe it wd. be advantageous to the economy.

P.T.	View of B/E.?

P.M.G.	Ambivalent.

P.M.	Banks shd. be taken seriously:  we cdn’t run country’s economy without them:  instruments of financial policy.

			Defer – later discussion.		[Exit P.M.G.

	5.	Commercial Policy:  Poland.

F.E.	As in memo.

C.S.	Bacon market is likely to fall in early ’62.  Recent rise is from a v. low level.  Supply too great.  Shall  have to try vol. control by importers to put sense into market.  Extra quota to Poland will destroy chance of persuading others esp. Denmark, to apply voluntary control.  Danish herd is rising &amp; they are trying to restrain it.
	Longer term.  para. 6 of memo.  We can’t find anything to take from Poland except food – and lots of it bacon.
	If we can’t control bacon market, pig subsidy will rise &amp; I shall need a Suppl. Estimate.

P.T.	Amount is marginal to bacon market as a whole.
Importance of getting aircraft exports into Iron Curtain countries.

H.B.	Ty. interests conflict.  Even so, we wd. support B/T.  Balance lies that way.  “Must put export interests first”  (P.M. directive).

J.H.	But gt. need for vol. agreement on bacon market.

R.A.B.	Farmers will be upset, just at moment when they are growing more reasonable over C. Market.
			Resume discussion next week.
			Statistics to be produced.
