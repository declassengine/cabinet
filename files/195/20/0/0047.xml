  <content>C.C. 21(62).					13th March, 1962.

	1.	Federation:  Ministerial Responsibility.	[Enter  M.R.

P.M.	For years past we have felt diffy of dealing with Fedn &amp; its 
		constituent territories through two Dpts. in Whitehall.  Has
		increased weight of problem itself.  Thrown unnecessary
		strain on Cab. system.
	Decided to transfer responsibility to a single Minister:  viz., the
		senior of the Secretaries of State.  Tho’ vital importance, not
		full-time:  also must avoid sense of crisis.  Decided with good
		will of both D.S. and R.M.
	Grateful to R.A.B. for stepping into the breach.
	Thanks to D.S. and R.M. for past services.

R.A.B.	Taking this as public duty.  Can see no solution.  Great intransigence:
		impossible to swim v. tide of African nationalism.  I fully
		realise all the diffies.
	Look for help of D.S. &amp; R.M.  Also shall need support from Cabinet.

D.S.	Sound decision.  Promise support.

R.M.	So do I.

	2.	Valuation for Rating.

P.M.	Held mtg.  Concluded tht. lesser danger wd. be to refrain from making
		exceptions for particular areas:-
	a)	Tho’, elsewhere, general average wd. be below 12½%, some 
		individual ratings wd. be higher.
	b)	In the 3 towns we wd. have invidious appearance.  Our motives
		might be misunderstood.  Also hotels etc., wd. hate it as much
		as householders liked it.
	c)	Poundage in these areas is low – well below national average.

	3.	Building Licensing.		[Enter  J.H.

S.Ll.	In 1956 and 1957 my predecessors decided against re-introduction.
	Now, there is further reason.  Bldg. industry is becoming more
		efficient.  In these circs. this wd. be wrong approach:  &amp; wd.
		produce bad effect on industry’s co-operation e.g. with N.E.D.C.
	Ready to consider other methods of easing pressure in particular areas.

Ch.H.	This stemmed from my pressure for more resources for slum-
		clearance.  I was impressed by our load on industry – with 20%
		increase in cost &amp; 15 mos. for completion of council houses.  
		Was ready therefore to consider control.
	But since then i) Ty. have agreed on means of startg. on my p’mme
		with chance of completion.  ii) M/W. has produced statistical
		reasons for belief that load on industry will be relieved.

M.	Re-introdn wd. be a mistake.  M/W. forecast is likely to be right.

J.H.	New orders are dropping off.  If present trend continues, industry will
		be under-employed in ’63.

D.S.	Overwhelming case wd. be needed to warrant re-introdn of this 
		complex control.

J.H.	Sitn in certain areas is bad.  Some action will be needed.  But no case
		for general control.

R.A.B.        x/	We need in reserve State authority to influence economy.  I cdn’t
		have done w’out them in 1951.  No sufft case now:  but believe
		we shd. arm ourselves with this power in future.  Also powers
		over monopolies.

S.Ll.	Evidence tht. in some areas bldg. industry is behaving like motor
		industry in poaching labour.  Bids up wages.

H.B.	Hope we can devise means of local control of office bldg.  We need
		to spread this more.

P.M.	Worried about x/.  After 6 years of war and 6 more	[Enter  E.H.
		of Socialism, pendulum swing to economic liberalism.  Believe
		it may have swung too far, from angle of Tory image.  Diffy is
		tht. in our recent crises the only weapons we have had are not
		selective.  Tho’ reconciled to not imposing bldg. controls now,
                   y/		I’m not impressed with social merit of present balance in bldg.
		In 1951 we were able to use bldg. controls, &amp; import controls:
		and we are left w’out economic regulators which we need.  We
		need to have them in reserve – if not this one, study import
		controls.  Monetary methods alone are v. blunt instruments –
		esp. when we need to contract in some areas only.
	Problem for Ty:  how can you operate v. particular areas w’out 
		affecting the country as a whole.

R.A.B.	Reserve powers shd. be studied – on bldg., imports, monopolies
		control.

			Agreed:   no introdn of bldg. controls now.
				       consider x and y/.  Prs. group of Ministers.

	4.	Leonardo’s Cartoon:   R. Academy.

H.B.	R.A. have invited Govt. to buy at a large figure.  With Ty. consent
		P.M. declined.  They were not surprised.  They decided to go 
		on with sale, by auction.  Press have now wormed this out of
		them.
	Possible courses.  i) nothing  ii) offer subsidy to R.A. – but they say
		they don’t want it.  iii) offer Govt. contn to a national fund to
		buy the picture at auction.
	Let public opinion develop before deciding on iii) – the most likely
		course.
	P.Q.’s for 22/3.  This gives us time.
	Sir C. Wheeler thinks it will be bought in this country.
	Agree we shdn’t encourage public appeal.  But can’t we give time
		for this to happen spontaneously.

	5.	Foreign Affairs.

	a)	Berlin.
E.H.	R. are dropping Window &amp; also flying at 7.000-10.000 ft. (?).
		N. has authority to fly above 10.000.

P.T.	Show our confidence in N.

E.H.	b)	Congo.
	A. &amp; T. are mtg. 15/3.  Wait.

	c)	Indonesia.
	No agreemt. on substance – tho’ near on procedure.

	d)	Burma.
	Have recognised new regime.

	e)	Haiti.
	W’drawn Ambassadors on both sides.

	f)	Disarmament.
	Opening moves at Geneva.  Not promising.

	6.	Germany:  Support Costs.

H.B.	When P.M. saw A. in Jan. he offered 50% of f. exchange cost 
		(£73 m. p.a. or 800 m. D.M.) for 2 years in arms purchases.
	My negotiations – G. cdn’t reach that figure – I argued tht. it cd.
		not be limited to 2 yrs.  Returned last week:  they offered
		£45 m. p.a. or 500 m. D.M.  I said this wasn’t enough – tho’
		indicated we mght. accept 600 m. D.M. – reportg. to N.A.T.O.
		our view tht. this was most G. cd. be expected to do.  Dr A. 
		said he wd. like to increase beyond 500.  Their trouble is 
		over-commitment to U.S. arms.
	They do want to help.  And we shall get substantial relief fr. them
		over next 2 years.
