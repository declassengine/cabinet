  <content>C.C.48(61).								4th August, 1961.

		Wages Policy.

S.L.I.		Cases ‘in pipeline’ in C. Service – gave facts.

A.H.G.	Dislike course (iii).  Post-dated cheques : irresponsibility : post war credits.
	I wd. prefer to suspend arbitration for a period, but allow negotiation to continue – on basis tht. Govt. wd. be in control of latter.

J.H.	But arbitn. is part of whole system of negotns.  To suspend it will bedevil atmosphere &amp; lose us all hope of co-opn.
	Suggested alternatives for final sentence.

Att.G.	Not in acc. with precedents, which were refusals to have arbitratn. at all on specific points.

M.	Was doubtful y’day.  Arbn. award w’out date will involve us in struggle in wh. we have little sympathy.

P.T.	This draft is not course (iii). If you w’draw timing &amp; staging, it is no longer arbitn.  Better therefore to suspend.

R.A.B.	Prefer to have no interference with arbitn. at all.
	But, if we have to do something, wd. prefer J.H.’s course.

Ch.H.	Do we intend, during pause, to evolve policy for relating wages to productivity?  If so, interim action must be consistent with tht.

D.E.	A no. of points – incldg. need for arbitn. under future policy, for betterment cases.
	In the pause, at least as severe.  Therefore, arbitrary guiding light now – as near zero as possible.  V. short pause : say it will last only long enough to work out policy eg. 31/12.  In so short a period, we cd. w’draw arbitn. by either of methods now suggested.

J.H.	We shan’t get a rational wage policy w’in 12 months.  Must be done with industry – and they won’t be hurried.  No early answer.  Avoid more action wh. will destroy their co-operation.  Suspension of arbitn. wd. destroy all hope of co-operation.

S.L.I.	No chance for new ‘planning’ machinery if it is thought to be primarily for wages.

I.M.	In 1960 under 1% (0.4%) of all wages increases came from arbitn. machinery provided by State.  It’s private sector that matters.
	V. serious matter indeed to interfere with arbitn.  If we must, I wd. prefer to suspend.
J.H.	But in 1958 it was 9.9% of total.

P.M.	Tho’ small, example to private industry is what matters.

S.L.I.	?Suspend arbitn. [while we discuss with Unions revision of 1925 agreement.]

J.H.	Prefer [] added to course (iii), not to suspension.

K.	Opposed to suspension.  Prefer course (iii).
