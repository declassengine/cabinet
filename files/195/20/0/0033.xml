  <content>C.C. 7(62).				23rd January, 1962.

	1.	I.C.I. and Courtaulds.	[Enter  M.R.

P.M.	R.A.B. prefers to dissociate himself from Cab. discussion.

F.E.	I.C.I. disclosure of 18/12 caused C. to break off discns for merger.
		I.C.I. then announced take-over bid.  Saw both sides to show
		Govt. altertness.
	Our policy so far has bn. one of non-intervention.  No powers.  
		Private enterprise knows its own interests best.  Took that
		line over Press, but had to concede R. Commn.  Public interest,
		tho’ difft, here too – even on on our side some uneasiness.  Shd
		we because of this modify earlier policy.
		Welcome views.

M.	Unfortunate ‘image’ of private industry.  Pity when firms can’t agree.
		Better face this (? do nothing).

I.M.	No validity in argument tht. this paves way for natn.  I.C.I. is ripe for
		it anyway.  Came up in last election:  did us no harm.
	Public opinion:  influenced by C. Market, for which larger units are 
		better.  Don’t intervene.

K.	L.P. referred to this in H/L. on 20/12.  Agree with line he then took.
		Monopoly condns existed before this deveopmt. occurred.
		Mon. Commn too small to deal with such large issues.
		C. Market argument is valid.  We shd. not rush in.

S.Ll.	Agree re natn and monopoly.  On terms of offer Govt. did not
		pronounce.  But feeling tht. Govt. shd. satisfy itself tht. this not
		contrary to natl interest.  Yet how can it do this?  Enquiry wd. 
		take too long.

D.S.	V. dangerous for Govt. to take on oblign to express a view on mergers.
		Where wd. you draw the line?  Prefer to rest on Monopolies
		machinery, which cd. be invoked after merger.

P.T.	Right for F.E. to inform himself.  But diff. for Govt. to judge the
		merits.  I.C.I. case if arguable:  no justificn for us to express
		dogmatic opposite view.  There wd. be nil for M. Commn to
		consider until about 3 yrs. after a merger.

J.H.	Govt. look stupid if they have no view.  Sympathise with S.Ll.’s 
		suggn.  Can’t however suggest what our view shd. be.
		This is not helpful to wage restraint or to ec. planning
		proposal.

Hail.	If anything contrary to public interest emerged, powers of modern	
		State are sufficient to deal with situation.

Ch.H.	Mon. Commn procedure isn’t v. good – no power to act in advance, 
		need to wait some time before enquiry, no power to enforce 
		action.
	Jenkins’ Cttee?

F.E.	No report until April:  then only techniques of take-over.

P.T.	Duties 20-30% wd. enable us to break up monopoly if we thght, it
		right.

E.H.	Attitude to monopolies &amp; size of firms will be greatly changed by
		C. Market competition, whether we are in or out of it.

P.M.	Better if opinion realised what problem is.  Nothing to do with 
		Clore type of transaction.  Exposition of technical issues
		at stake.
	Courtaulds don’t in fact dispute the main case – or they wd. not have
		considered merger in first place.  If the argument is over terms,
		we need not pronounce on that.

F.E.	Cd I say:  after aid of 2 assessors at mtg. with both cos:  nothg. 
		contrary to p. interest or somethg. else.  At least wd. show
		we were not disinterested.
	Mght. lead to I.C.I. reverting to policy for agreed merger.  Some
		indications tht. Courtaulds mght. be willing.

Hail.	There will not be enough evidence to warrant Govt. in expressing a
		definite view.

D.S.	F.E. wd. be assumg. function of M. Commn – in a half-baked way

M.	Don’t have 2 assessors.  If further conversations, keep them informal.
	(V. complex:  doubt if F.E. will understand it.)

P.T.	Dangerous precedent.  Shd be pressed to do the same in other cases.

S.Ll.	Don’t want Govt. to pronounce wtr. this is good or bad.
		But desirable tht. Govt. shd. satisfy themselves, by further 
		enquiry, that there is no reason why we shd. intervene.

D.S.	It is not a responsibility of Govt. to decide what is the most 
		efficient way for private enterprise to conduct its business.

P.T.	Further conversations wd. affect movement of share prices.

D.S.	And result wd. pre-judge any eventual reference to M. Commn.

P.M.	Let F.E. circulate drafts of statements – one continuing
		to suggest further conversations and the other not.
		We can foreshadow a statement in H/C. “shortly”.
		Ask I.C.I. to submit in writing their technical case for
		a single unit.

	2.	Indonesia.			[Enter R.A.B.

H.	Read draft statement.

Hail.	‘Stop’ or ‘suspend’?

F.E.	Must revoke licences.

S.Ll.	That ‘suspends’ exports.

P.M.	Then say “suspend”.  Make plain in answer to Supplementary that
		method will be revocation of licences.

	3.	Laos.

H.	Since memo. sitn improved.  3 Princes promised to produce national
		delegn to Geneva by ½.  Phonma likely to produce natl govt. –
		agreed any dispute over p’folio can be resolved by King.  Risk
		tht. Phonmi may cheat.
	Not anxious now to be precise with U.S. in last para. of memo.
		10(i) and (ii) will now suffice:  in conversation in W’ton: 
		no message.
	Believe now it will be more diff. for Princes to frustrate a settlement.

P.M.	No formal message.  Amb. cd. talk gently to Rusk tht. it will be diff.
		for us.  Or, better, thro’ Bruce.

	4.	United Nations:  Finances.		[Enter Perth

	a)	Contribution to Congo Operations.

H.	We must continue our contribn – at least while Int. Court is 
		considering the reference.

S.Ll.	Month to month, in arrear, and holding back equivalent of services
		rendered.

P.M.	None of Sec. Council members pay – save U.S. and ourselves.

H.	Only possibility of doing otherwise wd. be if C. operation had to be
		condemned by us.
Hail.	At least until Ct. decided, overwhelming case for continuing to pay.

P.M.	But remain free to dissociate ourselves from the operations and then
		decline to pay any more towards them.

	b)	General Finances:  Bonds.

H.	Mr K. has identified himself with plan to get $100 m. from Congress.
		U.S. percentage 32%:  ours 17.5%.  If we do that share = $15 m.
		They have asked us to buy $25 m.  Practical alternatives as in
		memo.  I strongly favour $12 m:  that will give us some influence
		with U.S.  We cd. space it out up to ’63.
                    x|	We cd. say we can’t repeat this &amp; do it on understanding tht. U.N.
		puts its house in order before ’63.

I.M.	Uneasy over H/C. re-action.  But, as U.S. put it to us, we can’t
		decline to contribute.  We shall be attacked for this.

H.	Surely x/ will help.

Hail.	Must be once-for-all.  Must be conditional on U.S. getting approval.
		Subject to that, I agree.

S.Ll.	If it’s a once-for-all, I wd. favour $12 m.  At $10 m. we shd. be 
		pressed for more.

P.T.	We have no oblign here.  It’s a phoney proposition.  Put more pressure
		on U.N. to put house in order.

K.	If we want U.N. to continue:  if we want U.S. to get Congress to 
		subscribe:  then U.N. collapses.  That is not our policy.

M.	Morally bound to support this organisation financially if we belong 
		to it.

J.M.	Yes:  but hope we can look at its future some day.

R.A.B.	Morally bound.

H.W.	Must assure our supporters tht. we also mean to try to reform U.N.

D.S.	Must also have a row in U.N. over defaulters.

H.	No moral oblign beyond this year.  Must have time to re-organise it.

P.	Cd we offer “up to $12 m.” &amp; make full payment conditional on
		“better behaviour”, especially over Congo.

E.H.	Influence in U.N. – important to our Colonial policy etc., over next
		4 years – depends on our retaining U.S. support in U.N.
P.M.	Next 6 wks. in H/C. will be critical.  Is this the moment?
		Half-Agreed in principle:  P.M. to consider timing, 
			and conditions.
