  <content>C.C. 20(62).					8th March, 1962.

	1.	Parliament.		[Emter  M.R.

I.M.	Business for next week.

	2.	Smoking and Health.	[Enter  E.P., A.B.

A.B.	S.Ll. concerned about “and to discourage”.
		Preferred is para. H. of App. B.  If we try to “discourage” we 
		may be led on to the further measures, or some of them.

P.M.	? Stop at “known”.

R.A.B.	Twice considered – rejected para. 10 of App. B.
		But admit this is an advance on earlier Govt. statement of 
		policy.

Hail.	Unreal point.  The facts do discourage.

P.M.	Dislike paternalism of ‘discourage’.

E.P.	It is a duty of l.a.’s to discourage if they believe it dangerous.

P.M.	Vice discourage say “&amp; to make clear to the public the dangers to
		health of smoking, particularly cigarette smoking”.
					[Exit  E.P.

	3.	Disarmament.		[Enter  Godber.

	General.

H.	Memo. for informn.
	U.S. reluctant to table constructive proposals.

J.G.	Memo. represents posn reached.
		i)	Chairmanship not agreed.  West proposing 
				co-Chairmen (U.S. &amp; R.) who will steer from behind,
				while actual Chair rotates between remaining 16.
		ii)	French not participating at all.
		iii)	Inspn &amp; verification is crucial issue – R. willing only to 
				have it applied to material destroyed.
	Procedure  -	First, genl. debate on objectives.
				Secondly, want to follow this with package deal (59).
					U.S. have promised proposals on some on
					Sunday, esp. on delivery vehicles.

				Third, initial list for 3 For. Ministers.  Tho’ others
					suspicious of any steering by 3 or more
					nuclear items.
H.	(iii) is crucial.

J.G.	Sampling idea comes from Pugwash.  Each country divided into 
		zones, which cd. be subject to comprehensive inspn à choix.
	Alternative, inspn of categories of weapon.
                  y/	Or, Western offer of one-for-one destruction:  wh. conforms to R. posn.

H.W.	Support memo. qua military considns.
		We shd. try to get U.S. into line.

J.G.	Can’t assess U.S. attitude because really their Disarmament agency 
		isn’t ready.

D.S.           x/	Hope we shall be f’coming in general debate – to avoid being
		out-done by K. in propaganda.

H.	We aren’t committed to take U.S. line:  but we must remember tht. it
		is they who have to disarm, not us.

K.	Analysed memo.  What chances have we of getting 9 package
		adopted as W. position, in face of U.S. reluctances.
	Para. 12.  Have we over-estimated need for internatl inspn?  Have R.		got a point here.  

	[P.M.	This is nuclear only – discuss separately.]
			
	Attach importance to para. 13.
	Danger for us:  need to tag along with U.S. may prevent us from 
		dealing with the real diffies.

J.G.	U.S. are said to be more fwd. in thinking than ever before.
		We shall have 2 wks. of genl. debate in which to align ourselves
		with U.S.  They have promised disclosure to us at week-end.

Hail.	Do we believe in genl. disarmament?  Does it not involve scrapping
		our R.A.F. &amp; R.N. – if we are to have only internal security
		forces.

H.	We cd. have forces to ensure internal security in other countries where
		we had responsibility.

D.S.	No, surely.  Treaty obligns wd. go in favour of internatl force.

H.	Colonies wd. be “internal”.

H.W.	A v. long-term objective.  Cdn’t move fast towards it.

D.S.	But don’t hedge our adherence to ultimate objective.  cf. x/ above.

P.M.	Not sure K. does get advantage by his extreme offers.
		No one was impressed by his suggn of 18 Heads of Govt.

H.	y/ is a good idea.  If R. refuse, we cd. offer %age redn.

	Nuclear Tests.

P.M.	Concerned about i) offer on non-transfer of n. weapons.  Will be
		taken as aimed at French.  Cdn’t be policed:  and therefore
		contrary to our genl. view on inspn.  Wd preclude our handing
		our n. strength to N.A.T.O. etc.

(J.G.	No “to any State” does not include transfer to an Alliance.)

P.M.	Wd at least prevent Anglo-French, or Anglo-German, arrangemt.  Will
       Agreed.		harm us in C.M. negotns.  At least make sure thro’ Dixon tht. it
		won’t give F. a handle v. us on C. Market.
		If it’s assurance to R. re G., better do it in a Berlin agreement.
				ii) Mr K. said he wd. make new proposals:  U.S. now
		seem reluctant.  Our scientists now believe natl detectn wd. be
		effective on all tests down to 5 meg. save behind the sun.  Cd we
		have natl systems, internationally managed.  That wd. go a long
		way to meet R.  I.e. internatl inspn only for verification.
		Avoids much of espionage difficulty.

H.	Diffy is tht. U.S. don’t yet accept our scientists’ view on this.

J.G.	U.S. are even suggesting inspns of prepns as well as actual tests.

D.E.	If Fr. say they won’t stop testing, what chance of R. agreeing to 
		3-Power Treaty.
						[Exit  J.G., E.H.

	4.	Kenya.

R.M.	K.A.N.U. – plan for unitary state, with some s’guards minorities.  But
		no security for European lands.
	K.A.D.U. – a federal system on Swiss model.  Inept for Africa:  but 
		2 principles of value:  upper Chamber and…….
	Advance likely on 2 points:  upper Chamber;  provincial authies with
		effective powers.  Second wd. be of value to Europeans.
	Mboya is gaining strength:  and Kenyatta is being undermined.
		Growing fear of Kikuyu domination.  Chance of a split.
	No talk of independence date.  Seems accepted tht. a long trial of
		self-govt. is necessary.
	Not much result for 3 wks’ work.  May have more to say next wk.

	[May have to put up develpmt. money for re-settlement of landless
		Africans on European lands.  Conference not worried by 
		economic problems.]

P.M.	What is our objective?

R.M.	Agreement on principles offering s’guards for minorities.
		These work for split in K.A.N.U.  Moderate element mght. accept
		long period of self-government.

C.S.	Does economy rest on genl. agriculture rather than big coffee &amp; sisal
		estates.

R.M.	Africans do recognise latter as essential to economy.  Their ambitions
		are directed to African share in genl. farm-lands of Europeans.
	If we cd. get agreement in principle on upper Chamber, independent
		judiciary, constitutional s’guards for minorities etc., we wd. work
		out a constitution implementg. those principles and hold further
		conference on that.

P.M.	Cd we get a picture of distribn between large estates and small farms.
		This shd. be circulated to Cab.  With indication of targets
      Agreed.		which Africans have in mind.

			Agreed:  memo. above.
				      also on what mght. emerge from conference.

	5.	Revaluation for Rating.

Ch.H.	Remaining ques.  Shd we de-rate in some areas?  10 show 10% or
		more increase.  Most are sea-side towns &amp; cause is lower valun
		of hotels etc.  In industrial towns, it is due to industries not
		doing well.  If you do this, you shift burden back on to the other
		categories whom valuers have relieved.  In B’mouth e.g. industry
		burden wd. go from 40 odd to 70 odd.  Burden on industry
		generally is to rise by 43%:  and wide variations from area to
		area.  120% in Derby, 104% in Bedford.  We shd. increase 
		pressure for same concession to industry in particular towns –
		tho’ no power.
	Pledges were given – but when it was thought that general burden on
		dwellings wd. rise.  H.B. said Tuesday he wasn’t committed by
		this to doing it now.

I.M.	Are we pledged?  In my view we shd. do this.  We took power to do it.
		I wd. accept ceiling of 12½%.  Did H.B.’s words amount to a
		pledge.

R.A.B.	They are all Tory strongholds.  Will look like politics.  Only 8 areas.

D.E.	Has turned out v. differently.
		Who benefits?  Shopkeeper, presumably:  if h’holders remain the
		same and 43% goes on industry.  Is this good economics?

F.E.	If we relieve h’holders in 8 areas, we weaken our power to w’stand
		industry’s pressure for same treatment.

J.H.	Agree.  Bound to make it worse.  We shall have greater political
		trouble.  H.B. doesn’t think he pledged us to this action.

E.M.	Also from ship-bldg.

J.M.	In Scotland industry’s burden will be up by 200%.

Ch.H.	Also:  the 4 leading areas have lowest rate poundage.

P.M.	Wd be easier if the rates were higher in these places.

A.B.	H.B. does not regard his statements as pledging us to this action.

P.M.	Believe there will be trouble either way.
		Wd like to reflect further.
			P.M., R.A.B., Ch.H., I.M., J.H. to consider &amp; recommend
				a conclusion to Cabinet.
