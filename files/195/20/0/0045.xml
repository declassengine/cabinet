  <content>C.C. 19(62).					6th March, 1962.

	1.	Foreign Affairs.		[Enter  M.R.

	a)	Disarmament.

H.	K. has agreed tht. 3 F. Ministers shd. meet first – with Gromyko
		on Mon.  Hope to offer agreement on tests wh. it will be diff.
		for R. to reject – tho’ all will turn on wtr. they decline to
		accept any inspn at all.
	Looks like Summit in May:  Mr K. is coming round to that.

	b)	Congo.

H.	Adoula has now said he wants to co-erce Katanga by force:  he
		cdn’t do that w’out U.N. troops.  Mtg. betwn. A. &amp; T. still
		necessary, tho’ now seems less likely.

	c)	West Irain.

H.	Shd we offer to act as mediators?  Don’t want to have to put pressure
		on Dutch.  Will report again next week.
					[Enter  J.H., J.B-C.

	2.	Oxford Road.

Ch.H.	On traffic grounds case for Meadow Rd. is the stronger.  Alternative
		is such a diversion tht. it wdn’t work w’out closing
		Magdalen Bridge.
	Cost:  diffce is small:  £½ m. even for sunk road.
	Is damage to amenity sufft. to outweigh these considns.
	If the Meadow is open space, need for Order.  Not yet clear that this
		will be necessary.  some delay however because development 
		plan will need to be changed - &amp; public enquiry on this if objns
		raised.  This might take 2 months or so.

Hail.	H/L. cd. impose absolute veto by refusing to pass the Order.
		Sure H/L. wd. not pass such an Order, now.
		But after a further enquiry we might get it through.

R.A.B.	It is not yet clear that Order will be necessary.

E.M.	Support Meadow road:  alternative is nonsense qua traffic.

H.B.	Little feeling in H.C. last summer.

D.S.	Favour road across Meadow.

H.	Dreadful prospect.  Whatever road you have, M. Bridge will have to
		be closed eventually.  Why not do it now, &amp; have longer road?
Hail.	i) If you build B. road, &amp; it achieved maximum, you wd. need
		Meadow road too in the end.  ii) Many homes wd. have to be
		demolished:  serious outcry.  iii) Closing M. Bridge wd. not
		solve traffic problem:  traffic wd. come in via Car tax &amp; return
		by same way.

H.B.	Model removes many of fears of amenity.

J.H.	But its peace would be ruined.

D.S.	We are concerned with amenity of the precinct – not speed of traffic.
		We want peace in the precinct, not merely in the Meadow.

D.E.	Traffic will get worse – ruining amenities of most Colleges.
	Why shd. we be concerned only with amenity of the Meadow.
	If you can’t close M. Bridge, you must have a road that will attract
		people from not going up the High.

D.S.	Support Meadow road, but want to close M. Bridge too.

H.B.	Cd consider that – but only when Meadow road is there.

R.M.	“Impervious to logic &amp; hope reason will be defeated, &amp; Meadow road
		with it.”

K.	Favour Meadow road.

J.M.	If it’s open space, compulsory purchase procedure will be involved
		too.

F.E.	Remember object = preserve amenity in centre of Oxford.

M.	Weight of opinion in H/L. against Meadow road.

I.M.	Agree with F.E.  Price is worth paying.

R.A.B.	In H.A. Cttee clear majority in favour of Meadow road.
		In Cab. opinion rather more evenly divided.
		Cd we not know first what Parly posn is?

Ch.H.	V. awkward to ask ch.ch in advance of announcing our decision.

Hail.	Serious consequences for H/L. if they veto-ed this.

Ch.H.	Even so, much prefer to take decision first on merits.

R.A.B.	We can risk H/L;  for if they veto-ed Order we cd. introduce Bill &amp;
		push it through under Parlt. Act.

		Agreed:	proceed with Meadow road – sunk.
				(? without street lighting)
					[Exit  E.M., J.B-C.

	3.	Government Building:  Broad Sanctuary.

J.H.	As in memo.

D.S.	Material?

J.H.	Mainly concrete:  but architect is considering stone base.

D.S.	Good design:  but concrete has bn. criticised – may look shoddy
		opposite W’minster Abbey.

J.H.	Will consider again.
					[Exit  J.H.
					[Enter  E.P., P.M.G.
	4.	Smoking and Health.

R.A.B.	Can we authorise Answers in Annex B?  To go further wd. need more
		thought.

D.E.	Exhortn w’out example is not effective:  also tobacco advertising is
		slanted to the young.  If I don’t go beyond Annex B., I shall be
		asked what teachers can do if we don’t restrict advertising of
		tobacco.  Wd like study of consequences if restrictg. advertising.

Hail.	Pretty serious course to start on restricting advertising.  What about
		alcohol:  chocolate.

S.Ll.	£880 m. p.a. to revenue.

J.M.	Impressed by increasing pressure for action.

E.P.	Least we can do is B. &amp; saying we are studying other measures.
		Pressure for other measures will build up.

			Approved B.
			Prepare (N.B.) announcement tht. we are studying
				other measures.

I.M.	Will answers to 2 P.Q.’s be enough (Annex B.)?
	Wd prefer statemet.

E.P.	I am first on Mon:  P.Q. already down:  can get others added.
		To volunteer statement wd. excite expectn of wider
		announcement.
					[Exit  E.P.


	5.	Housing Policy:  Valuation for Rates.

Ch.H.	Overall posn gives prospect (para. 10) tht. householders’ share will
		be slightly down, industry will be 43% up.  No case for general
		order to relieve householders.  F.B.I. are preparing campaign for
		statement on industry.
	Appeals r. assessments make these figures approximate.  Success at 
		appeal by industry might increase burden on householders.
	Variation between areas.  Mentioned those with more than 10%
		increase.  Shd there be abatement for these?  Sea-side towns.
		Due to fact tht. hotels are doing worse relatively.  B’mouth:
		excess of shops.  But 2 industrial towns in top 10 – Bristol
		&amp; Stockport.
	Against local abatement.  i) Shifts burden to another class, who will
		protest.  ii) If we abated over 10%, what of those just below?
		iii) Strengthen case for industry to have some relief.  iv) Wd
		reduce B’mouth’s contn to Dorset river board (who are already
		13%).  Thus, if tolerable, better to adhere to equity.  Once we 
		offer abatement, we open gates to other pressures.  Many of the
		hard hit have low poundages – tho’ not, I must admit, all.
	If we abated over 10% - B’mouth industry wd. rise 40-80%.  And
		in most areas it wd. be 8-10%.
	Considered other ways of helping sea-side towns.  Not by rate
		deficiency:  which other l.a.’s wd. oppose.

I.M.	Other pressures:  cd. be resisted because only power we have is for
		dwellings.
	Transfer of burden:  in industry etc., rates are business expense.
	Real ques:  are we pledged?  Believe we are.  Agree it’s better than
		H.B. believed at time of his speech.  But we have relied
		extensively on that speech – “taken power to cushion the rise”
		on houses.  We shall be expected to use this power.

H.B.	I wd. not regard myself as pledged if still Minister.
		The storm we shall have will be from industry.
		Assumed at time of speech tht. burden on industry wd. be 
		Level. Will be harder to meet this pressure if we have done
		somthg. discriminatory for dwellings.

Ch.H.	If we had to do this, confine it to top 10.

Hail.	Don’t want to make this concession and then another on Sched. A.
S.Ll.	Thought of p’poning that issue until 1963.  Various views w’in 
		Party, on abolition.  But some concession is likely to be made.

R.A.B.	P.M. wd. be disposed to favour some plan for top 10.

S.Ll.	Won’t it give us more trouble, in the end – political racket.

I.M.	Not if we relieved all above a certain figure.

Ch.H.	Shops, going down by 13%, are due to lose next April a 20%
		abatement.  They wd. do worse in areas specially abated for
		houses.

H.B.	These are forecast figures:  what of those near the line whole posn
		changes on actual figures.

Ch.H.	Or by appeals?

Ch.H.	12½% wd. help from that angle.

			Discussion to be resumed – Thursday.

	6.	Farm Price Review.

C.S.	Para. 5.  Expln:  if milk were cut by 0.4d, consumer wd. carry more of
		burden – it wd. be 8d for all save 4½ mos. when it wd. be 8½d.
	Since memo, more talks with N.F.U.’s.  No chance of agreed 
		settlement at any reasonable figure.  Shd we then go for £14 m?
		Against doing so:  somethg. in farmers’ argument tht. over £6 m.
		will be a minus on income next year – by £8 m. at figure of
		£14 m.  For we have to take efficiency factor at £25 m.
	Trying to carry farmers on C. Market, but ’62 will be difficult year.
		Full cut will cause full protest to be turned on.  £10 or 11m. will
		be taken with grumbling.  At £4 m., I wd. cut milk;  and Ty. wd.
		not lose:  they wd. still save £16 m.

H.B.	At Cttee oversea/independent/members argued v. milk proposals.  As
		condition not met, will be assumed 0.8d.
	Is it desirable to have minimum determination this year, in view of
		Supplementary?
	Para. 3(iii) quotation is incomplete.  Went on tht. in exceptional
		circs. we cd. go to minimum consistent with Act.
	If we give more than minimum, we shall be told we’ve missed a 
		chance to economise.  Wd put £3.4 m. on to cost of milk.

R.A.B.	Against that, need of farmers on C. Market.
	If £16 m. to Exchequer:  shd. take the help of 0.4d on milk.

I.M.	If no Ty. interest, I wd. support £11 m.
C.S.	1d off pool price of milk, when costs are rising by 0.8d, this is pretty
		stiff.

H.B.	I wd. accept £11 m. if it’s final.

J.H.	Sorry C.S. is not expanding small farmers’ scheme as means of 
		enabling us to reduce general price subsidies.

H.B.	I wd. favour £2½ m. on that scheme and same off fertiliser subsidy.
C.S.	Cd extend to larger farms.  But want to keep this in reserve for next
		year when we are in C. Market.

D.E.	Public will wonder if we have bn. tough enough on beef.

			Agreed:  at £11 m.
