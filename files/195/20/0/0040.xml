  <content>C.C. 14(62).					15th February, 1962.

	1.	Berlin.			[Enter  M.R.

P.M.	R. challenging our rights in air corridor.  Last week-end, we braved
		it out.  Another test likely now.

H.	They are putting up fighters this morning – harassing tactics.

H.W.	A no. of fighters are in corridor.  But R. claim to corridor ends to-day.

P.M.	Getting rough – anxious period.  Hard to see who is in control and
		what is object.  How does it square with re-action to disarmament
		initiative.

H.	Have sent message to Gromyko, warning him of risks.

	2.	Parliament.

I.M.	Business for next week.

	3.	Government Expenditure.                      [Enter B-C., E.P., P.M.G.

S.Ll.	£1470 m.  5 yrs. ago 1958/59:  2.000 m. next year 1963/64.  We are 
		not static.  Believe p’mme Ty. now suggest is necessary restraint.
		We shall spend more, &amp; tax more:  ques. is by how much.
		Ty. proposals do no more than reduce p’mme by £40 m.

H.B.	In 61/62 12½% increase.  Ty. want 6% in 1962/3 – agreed.  Other
		Ministers want it to rise to 10% in 1963/4:  Ty. want to keep it
		at 6%.

P.M.	On incomes we may have more success than expected last July.
		Rlway. unions seemed responsible – don’t want to be militant.
		Will that in itself limit inflation?  Not sure we shall get it yet:
		and even if we do its only restraint, not a stop:  there will in any
		event be injection of substantial purchasing power.
	What about 2½% pledge?  Degree of our failure on that will increase
		need for economies elsewhere – or at least pressure for it - &amp; we
		ought therefore to be cautious on investment.  Must therefore, for
		pol. reasons, leave alone economic watch control on investment
		with failure to contain current expre w’in 2½ pledge.
	If some Ministers decline to toe this line, others will ask for their
		sacrifices already made to be re-opened.
	On balance I wd. prefer to achieve stability as base for expansion
		later.

R.A.B.	Ty. may be pessimistic on future.  But leave this aside.
		Concentrate on political.  In 2 wks. – shall be shown not to have 
		fulfilled 2½% pledge.  If we can’t be convincing on long-term
		control we shall be in trouble in H/C. – reacting on City &amp;
		f. opinion - &amp; shake to sterling.
	We must therefore show we are getting stability first.
	I wd. therefore be ready to do school meals (6d).
	Capital.  H.O. have agreed to cut 3% - means defending 3 in a cell etc.
	If some of us are willing to do this sort of thing, all shd. co-operate.
	Conclude:  we must be able to make strong statement on 27/2.

F.E.	Support that view.  If pay pause succeeds, won’t be hard to re-phase
		investment p’mme.

H.W.	Support R.A.B. view:  that is why I accepted - £50 m. on defence.

I.M.	R.A.B. is right in analysis of Party feeling.
		But, whatever we do, we shan’t meet 2½% pledge.  How are we
		to explain that?  Unless we say:  bigger prizes to win if incomes
		policy succeeds.  That success wd. make all these figures look
		v. small.  Wrong therefore to do anythg. wh. mght. prejudice
		success of incomes policy.  Cd support school meals &amp; proposal
		on agriculture.  Wrong to touch welfare milk.

P.M.	Can’t you give reasons why you can’t get w’in the 2½%.  Can’t you
		say it wd. have bn. much worse if you hadn’t tried so hard.

S.Ll.	Shall have to admit I was wrong - &amp; give reasons e.g. rlway. deficit.
		But want to be able to go on to claim greater control over 
		expanding p’mmes.

M.	Not impressed by Ty. arguments.  Incomes more important.
		But ?suppose/believe we must do what is proposed.

C.S.	£16 m. is maximum cut we cd. impose w’in pledges etc.
		I shall try for this:  but other factors &amp; shall come back to Cab. if
		I want to recommend smaller cut to get agreed settlement.

J.M.	Hope we don’t touch milk.
	Ready to accept school meals if we must:  but don’t want it announced
		in isolation.  Off-take falls rapidly.  Want it placed in context of
		getting expre under control.

H.B.	Meals will be more unpopular than milk.  7/6 or 10/- per family is
		heavy at this time of year.
	Milk is less of a blow &amp; families can temper it by ordering less.
		This also is right time for this:  meals cd. be done later.

E.P.	Agree with H.B.  This is not welfare, save for the small element we
		propose to retain:  it is indiscriminate subsidy.  I positively
		want it abolished – in interests of N.H.S.  Powers are expiring
		in ’64:  legn will be needed by 1963/4 session:  if we haven’t 
		streamlined it by then we shd. be permanently providing for
		out-of-date subsidy.

S.Ll.	Cd we say we were anticipating re-organisation we wd. make in any
		event.

D.E.	On educn wd. sooner see increase in charge for meals than reduction
		in rate of expansion of p’mme for teachers etc.
	Ready to accept (meals) if Cab. want it.
	But if only major cuts are related to children, won’t be easy to present.

P.M.	I am opposed to both meals and milk.
		Think of effect on e.g. rlwaymen.  I cdn’t have said what I said
                     x/	to them y’day.
	The incomes policy is for much higher stakes.

J.H.	That policy is bound to fail if we do either.

R.A.B.	Then we shd. never give pledges like the 2½%.

K.	Over £100 m. excess is really too much:  qua effect on confidence etc.

S.Ll.	Must then be able to be firm on future expenditure.

C.S.	Welfare milk will be on top of ½d p. gall. extra on all milk prices for
		4 mos. in year.

D.E.	Only incomes policy can keep export prices down.
		What is point of company £50 m. off public investment in 63/64.
	Ty. memo. argues (para. 9) for deflation this year – more slack.
		Para. 5.  We cd. get more out of available plant.
	Look at 5., 6., 17.  Policy shd. therefore be better use of skilled labour
		we have &amp; train more – i.e. expand education.  Otherwise we
		ought to reduce private investment.
	How can Ty. argue tht. £50 m. off investment will “do the trick”.

S.Ll.	All a ques. of degree.  Ques. of getting economy into balance.  If we
		allowed more for home market, exporters wd. come back to it –
		softer option.

R.M.	If we have to plan ahead, we mustn’t put the figures too high.
		Cd they be given a bracket.

D.E.	£146 m. needed to carry out p’mme.  Reduced to £136 m.  Then came
		down to £131 m.  Below that I shd. have to announce that
		announced p’mmes will be delayed.
C.S.	Can’t M/Ed. see l.e.a.’s:   explain economic situation:  put figure as
		maximum sacrifice.

H.B.	In 63/4 and 64/5 he planned starts of £66 m. in each.  He offered
		£60 m.  Cd he not give them £55 for 1st yr. saying he will do 
		better if he can.

D.E.	Thght. yardstick was work done.  If I can work on starts, instead,
		I will consider it.  Not sure that at £55 m. I cd. keep work done
		w’in Ty. limit.

H.B.	My suggn wd. bite on work done:  for £55 m. starts wd. apply to
		future years also.

P.M.            *	Settle for £57½ . starts.

H.B.	Tell l.e.a.’s £55 m. adding more if thing go well.  1963/4.

E.H.	Time we started thinking how we are to secure growth.  We need
		a policy here.
	What are we going to do to increase supply of skilled labour.
		Or get better service from oversea posts on exports.
	These things will cost more money.

J.H.	In 1961 we got 11½% increase in no. of apprenticeships by industry.

F.E.	‘Pleasure’ industries are sucking in labour etc., which ought to be
		going to exports.  Incomes policy cd. check expansion of those
		industries.

E.H.	Restriction of home market doesn’t lead industry to increase exports.
		They usually wait for home market to revive.

		{  Education investment:  Agreed as at *.  No other change.
		{  Generally on investment:  these figures are floor-basis of *.

S.Ll.	School meals – wd. accept understandg. we wd. do it at some figure
		later in the year.  Say 3d or 4d.

J.H.	Repeated y/.  This is psychology, not logic.

H.	What about the Parly diffy over the 2½% pledge?

P.M.	Weigh that v. success of incomes policy.

Ch.H.	Wd favour these cuts if they wd. give us the target.  Does it matter
		much if we are £111 m. instead of £98 or so?

H.B.	There will be risk to sterling.  If Cab. decide to take it, let us at least
		re-examine milk &amp; meals plan in a few months when critical
		period of incomes policy is over.

S.Ll.	2d on meals later in year will do for me.
	Can I have assurance there won’t be heavy Supplementaries.
		So I can say we are in control of future.
H.B.	School meals &amp; milk – aim at announcg. May or June for
		implementn Sept. Oct.
				                                    [Exit  B-C., P.M.G., E.P.
	4.	Service Pay.                                    [Enter  C., J.P., J.A., R.W.

H.W.	i)	Timing.  1st Apl. is recognised date:  announcemt. expected in
			debates on Def. &amp; Service Estimates.
	ii)	Comparison is with pre-pause period.
	iii)	Recruiting, tho’ better, is only just getting us nos. requd for all
			regular forces.
	iv)	Grigg system – introduced because Services had lost confidence
			tht. Govt. wd. treat them fairly.  Para. 5 arguments.
			D.S. pledged Govt. to continue the system.
	Base my case on argument that Services are a class apart.
	Figures:  9% etc.  We cd. defend it.  But if some sacrifice must be
		imposed, do it in 2 bites.  Tho’ this wd. w’hold £14 m. for
		12 mos.  They wd. lose it for all time.

S.Ll.	Guilleband was similar undertakg. to rlwaymen.
	But fear we must honour this.
	Need we do it from ¼.  Better give whole amount 9% from 1/10.

H.W.	Services wd. then lose 7 months of their pay.

H.B.	Admitted he accepted inclusion of marriage allowance.

M.	Favour 9% from 1/10.

C.	Accept this if it can be announced now.
&amp; others

J.H.	Enormous figure.  H.W.’s plan goes away from Guilleband principle.

P.M.	Let us consider which method is the better, as a matter 
		of presentation.   Ty., M/D., M/L. and Ch.H.
