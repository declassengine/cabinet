  <content>C.C. 75(61).					19th December, 1961.

	1.	Goa.				[Enter  M.R.

H.	Resoln in U.N. passed by 7:4.  Those against included Ceylon, 
		Liberia, Russia &amp; Egypt.

D.E.	C’wealth Edn Confce in January.  Must I go?

P.M.	Yes.  It is a C’wealth occasion.

H.	This has set off Indonesia.  Dang. sitn in New Guinea.  Must discuss
		with U.S. in B’muda.  Wd like a note on oil tankers &amp; other
		B. interests.

Hail.	Nehru’s action likely to touch off a series – and we are at risk in
		various places e.g. Gib. or H. Kong.

I.M.	Wd it not be wise to make Assembly discuss this – breach of the rule
		of law.

R.M.	What if majority supported Indian action?  [Don’t let it drop, on a veto.

H.	Implicns for U.N. might be serious.  Do we want to break it up?  Not a 
		matter for hasty decision.  Wd prefer to discuss with U.S.
		M’while will get views of our Delegn in N. Yk.

K.	What is moral posn of C’wealth if we exclude S. Africa because
		apartheid and then retain India despite naked aggression?

P.M.	Better to take a U.N. stand over Indonesian aggression v. N. Guinea.
		Avoids C’wealth issue.

H.	Even so, not a v. clear issue.

	2.	Congo.

H.	T. has left for Ndola with Br., Fr. &amp; U.S. Consuls.  Gullion mtg. him 
There &amp; expects to take him on to meet Adoula at Kitona.  Before leavg. E’ville T. himself called for a cease-fire.  (But U.N. troops stupidly attacked by air the H.Q. of Union Minière.)
	U.S. are now alive to dangers - &amp; pressing urgently for settlement.

	3.	Laos.

H.	All 40 points of diffce with R. have bn. resolved save on (integratn of
		P. Lao into natl forces)  wh. can’t be settled until Prince’s are
		agreed.  U.S. are now putting heat on Phoumi to agree to 
		natl govt.  If that comes off, there is an agreement – with 
		R. &amp; Ch.  Not bad.

P.M.	Moral.  For dealg. with R. must have repve who can spend months
		on it continuously.  Mtgs. of F. Ministers, too short – don’t work.

	4.	Berlin.

H.	On ground reasonable quiet.  U.S. have stopped sending civilians in
		Offl. cars into E. Berlin.  But moral of W. Berlin is declining –
		&amp; this is reason for G. to support negotns.  In N.A. Council
		14 favoured this &amp; only 1 v. it.  Endless argument with the 
		French over any use of “negotiation” or “….. cd.” in 
		communiqué.  Much more strongly worded resoln wd. have 
		bn. passed if Fr. had not bn. represented.  Obvious we shall 
		have gt. trouble with Fr. when we reach substance.
	Rusk convinced tht. R. want to settle this with U.S.  Thompson may
		carry it far alone.  Dangerous, unless G. kept fully in line.  So
		aim at 3 Powers contact in Moscow.  France will stay on 
		side-lines.
	Admit that, on R. public statements, there isn’t much hope of an 
		acceptable settlement.

P.M.	If U.S. ready to take lead to U.S./R. settlement, may be better than
		Anglo-U.S. settlement.  Rusk might be willing to be a fall-guy.
	Br. people aren’t ready for war over Berlin:  they dislike G. almost
		as much as R.

H.	U.S. are more ready to fight for Berlin.  

H.W.	They feel their nuclear strength at moment is superior to R. &amp; they
		can therefore “lean on them for a bit”. 

	5.	Meeting of N.A. Council.	[Enter  E.M.

H.	Alliance under strain.  Feel they aren’t sufftly consulted on matters of
		concern to them – e.g. Berlin.  Unco-opve attitude of Fr.  Feeling
		tht. U.K. haven’t done enough on build-up.  Diffies on 
		Co-policy – e.g. Belgium &amp; Portugal:  agreed to consult more,
		before ques. come up in U.N.
	Stationing costs.  Save Germans.  Stikker helpful to us.  No source of
		help save G.
	M.R.B.M.’s.  U.S. ready to consider plan of control devised by 
		Europeans.  U.S. rely on disagreemt. – to preserve key/cupboard.
		But G. pressing for some control.  Fr. m’while won’t commit
		themselves because holding free to give to G.

H.W.	Strength of B.A.O.R.  No pressure on me.  Stikker accepts our need
		for financial help before doing more.  U.S. prefer us to look
		after M/E. &amp; S.E.A. – bigger reserve in U.K. vice more in G.
		But doubt if we’ll get much out of G.  U.S. have done better 
		(arms deals) than we.
	M.R.B.M.’s.  We shan’t stall this much longer.  Stikker wants solution.
		Need agreed U.S./U.K. posn on this.  N.A.T.O. nuclear force 
		dominated by G. wd. not be much good.

P.M.	i)   Who will buy them?  U.S. interest in selling.
	ii)  Who will control them?  Do Eur. fear most tht. U.S. will, or will
		not, use them.  What is real object of N.A.T.O. – to restrain U.S.
		or to ensure action?

H.W.	Can’t settle this w’out prior agreement on N.A.T.O. strategy – 
		e.g. nature &amp; length of pause.  N.A.T.O. won’t face fact tht.
		Saceur’s interdiction plan involves total nuclear war.

E.H.	Must seek solution in N.A.T.O. for w’out it Eur. will concentrate on
		defence w’in Six.  They are doubtful wtr. U.S. will defend them.
		Cause of increasg. friction.  Admit, however, tht. this control
		Is veto:  wdn’t give Eur. power to initiate w’out U.S. consent.

P.M.	In these circs. it is mainly a political problem.  With growing strength
		they are resentful of inferiority to U.S.

H.	Diffy is tht. you can’t satisfy that feeling w’out includg. G. – and that
		will stimulate R. fears.

P.M.	The only real solution is detents with R.

H.	U.S. are beginning to feel this.		[Exit  M.R.

	6.	Kenya.

R.M.	No fuss over removal of disqualificn on Kenyatta.
	Tribal diffies are as deep as we feared.  But hope for calm until the
		conference in Feb.
	Coastal strip.  Don’t raise this until after conference.
	Some chance of agreed solution in Feb. conference.

Hail.	Any prospect tht. independent K. will be able to m’tain law &amp; order?

R.M.	K.A.R. bldg. up:  unlikely to be dominated by any single tribe.
	Settlers:  Bill of Rights in constitn.  If we can get that, most will be
		satisfied.

H.	We move so fast from self-govt. to independence.  Can’t we prolong
		first.

R.M.	Not worth it if we can’t get p’ponemt. for about 5 yrs. – and no chance
		of that.  Local offls. satisfied no chance of delaying it beyond
		spring of ’63.

Hail.	Don’t believe you can get stable security force or adminn by early ’63.

H.W.	O.K. if white officers cd. be retained.

R.M.	Can’t work that out (or a base facility) save with a self-governing
		Govt.
	Base – not in present form:  something, on coast, as C’wealth facility.

D.S.	Don’t believe Africans wd. accept tht. such a base was to defend 
		their interests.

H.	cf. Congo:  can’t recover sitn if disorder once starts.

R.M.	Business interests favour speed of settlement, to end uncertainty.
		Farmers take other view.

H.W.	I cdn’t afford to build a new base.

H.	Nigerian resoln in U.N. – 10 years – because they fear it earlier esp. in
		C. Africa.

R.M.	Wd they back us in staying another 5 yrs. in Kenya?

P.M.	We must evaluate risks of both courses.  Risks also in delay.

J.H.	We ought to have full discn on constitution before conference opens.

P.M.	Yes:  early in Feby, when we know what the bids will be.

R.A.B.	Must preserve some posn of strength – C’wealth base.

R.M.	Not as main base – leave camps, training etc.

D.S.	Not much chance:  cf. Nigerian dislike of Defence agreement.

H.W.	K.A.R. will have to take it over:  we mght. be able to use it as 
		training area.

P.M.	Discuss this – with C.O.

	7.	C’wealth Organisations:  Immunity.	[Enter  Solr. Genl.

D.S.	Dislike inequality in principle.  Nos. involved are v. small cpd. with
		those of internatl bodies.  Second-class status.
J.S.	Involves denial of justice to our citizens, let alone taxation.
		Must accept this for international organns – e.g. R. wdn’t come
		here w’out immunity.  For C’wealth it isn’t necessary:  why 
		concede it?

D.S.	V. unreal.

S.Ll.	Tax immunity is a racket.  We don’t concede it automatically.
		Ikramullah:  salary &amp; allowances.
		JA:  salary &amp; allowances.
	Why shdn’t they pay tax?  Why make this a status symbol?

P.M.	Why strain at this gnat when the camel of the diplomatic body is
		so large.

J.S.	Because each concession makes it more diff. to resist the next.

K.	This proposal is contrary to all principle.  Immunity rests on treaty
		&amp; international law – to make it poss. for diplomat to do his 
		work.  These don’t apply:  nor insist/ask on waiver.
	Case for it is purely sentimental.

R.A.B.	Cdn’t we follow officials’ advice – waive process and get organn to 
		impose its own taxation – as in para. 9.

K.	No treaty:  no oblign on them.

P.T.	Para. 4.  Why extend this to the individuals?
		Why not consider what privileges shd. extend, on merits, to 
		each organisation?

M.	Look at each on merits.

D.E.	Not sentimental.  C’wealth English Language Centre won’t be
		established in Ldn. unless there is tax exemption.

H.B.	Cd we have estimate of how many organisations will come along.

P.M.	Is legn needed?
		What can we do about it by adminve means?
		[Is any selective method practicable?] incldg. x/.

E.H.	We shall be confronted with this on a larger scale over C. Market:
		About 5.000.

D.S.           x|	Cd we solve it by attachg. individuals concerned to their C’wealth
                    |		H. Commr.

P.M.	Also list of C’wealth organisations involved or likely to 
		be involved.
	Also a form of words for D.E. to use in Delhi.
	Extent of discriminn in reln to foreigners.
