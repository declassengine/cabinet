	1.	Wages Policy.                              [Enter R.W., P.M.G., E.P., M.R.

S.Ll.	Mtgs. on Friday.  Employers satisfy.  Recognd pause cdn’t. last indefinitely.
		Fear run-away on rates.
	T.U.C.:  no proposals:  asked for mine.  Eventually promised them a paper.
		Must reach them by Wed. a.m. when econ. cttee meets.  Indicns they want to co-operate.  Paper therefore will repeat what has bn. said (on planning esp., to avert criticism tht. this if for wage restraint only):  refer to profits restraint (in terms of my H. C. statement of Dec._ tho’ no plan to limit profits of individual firms – show how profits are falling &amp; how small (7%) propn of total.  What shd. we say on end/pause?  Repeat 18/12 – long-term policy will take time to work out:  look for arrangemts. with 2 sides of industry wh. will enable pause to end?  by end/financial year.  Show how it will end for public services – particulars includg. arbitration.  (Let agreed settlements operate:  let M. rate be resumed:  re-open arbitn but w’out retrospn).  Then outline policy for private sector – no freeze but guidance for interim period.  For 1962 increases to be w’in %age increase in productivity (21/2%):  alternatively in terms of quantity £500m. = maximum available for wages &amp; salaries (3%):  or (Mills) when productivity can be measured decide how much cd. be available for wage increases:  average that &amp; say it’s available to non-productive.
		Believe this is so complex tht. it must be reserved as long-term solution.
		Real choice is betwn. 1st or 2nd alternative.  My feeling is v. 2nd, because will lead to argument on what happens to £200m. diffce betwn. total increase of £700m. and the £500m. said to be available for wage increases.

P.M.	T.U.C. seem to have bn. more co-operative.  Aim: get them to enter into planning body &amp; get acquiescence in an interim policy.
	Date for opening of a new interim policy.  End of financial year?

M.	That is about right, if interim policy is accepted.
Still dislike percentage:  prefer money terms.

Ch.H.	How do you reconcile 2½% with arbitn ?

S.Ll.	Hope arbitrators will have regard to the 2½%.

Ch.H.	Suppose they don’t?  Do we pay higher award?

S.Ll.	Wd have to do so where arbitn is obligatory.
J.H.	Arbitrators will heed the guidance, esp. if its supported by 2 sides of industry.

H.B.	Support %age.

J.H.	Do I.

J.H.	Date.  Pause shd. not outlast financial year, subject to satisfy. arrangemts. for interim.

S.Ll.	If we cd. get agreement I wd. be ready to end pause earlier – x at once.

D.S.	%age:  what incentives to efficient industries?

S.Ll.	Employers have varying approaches  e.g. I.C.I., rubber industry.

J.H.	Not really at once because of pending claims in rlways. &amp; private sector (engineers).

P.M.	May need to say in advance we expect Govt. policy will be needed by arbitrators.

S.Ll.	In my first paper to T.U.C. enough to say arbitn will have to be discussed.

P.M.	On alternatives:  say £700m.:  not all available for wages:  must also carry non-productive workers.  In practical terms it means average of 2½%.

M.	Effect on engineering where employers have rejected claim entirely.  If you say this, you will be inviting them to award 2½%  [in the summer].

D.E.	Paper shd. include concept tht. amount available for wage increases is flexible – increased if industry improves performance.  Must plug growth.  Can’t get it w’out more orders:  that needs greater efficiency for same wages for a time in order tht. higher wages may be earned later.  In engineering it’s piece rates that matter – and they turn on output, which won’t come unless we can inflate.  The promise of inflation is the only thing which will make the men pause on wage rates.
	In public services the dammed-up rates are about 5%.

I.M.          |	Are we not trying to ride 2 horses?  T.U.C. wd. not join N.E.D. if they
                 |		knew proposals later on our agenda to-day – and wd. w’draw when these [Dislike 21/2% because will be taken as minimum] 
                 y		were announced.
                 |	If we want T.U.C. co-opn and planning for growth, we can’t have cuts
                 |		in publ. expre they think unfair.
H.W.	Set these out as problems for N.E.D. to settle, not as Govt. dictat.
Expound sitn.  £500m. = 21/2%.  If growth achieved, there would be more.  Let us discuss how we did it.

H.B.	They want to come in – centre of power.  These advisers have told them restraint is necessary: 2½% not unreasonable.

S.Ll.	They are in fact split.  But on the defensive more than before.
	I promised to give, near end/’61, some further guidance.  Can’t hold pause v. much longer.
	Of course we must put major emphasis on growth.  But need some interim arrangement while we plan future growth.

P.T.	This paper will be of v. gt. importance.  Concessions on public service as bait for acceptance of 2½%.  What happens if 1st is snapped up and 2nd is rejected.  Surely we shd. see this paper in draft.

H.	If 21/2% becomes minimum, won’t it be eroded by arbitn?

J.H.	No.  Engineers may stand pat on nil.

H.	Why?

J.H.	They mean to do so because competitiveness.

M.	Don’t see how they can.

M.	Believe my plan is right for interim.  Wish to discuss with S.Ll.

E.M.	Timing.  Leap-frogging cd. be avoided if all claims settled at same time.

J.H.	V. long-term ques.

E.P.	Ques. on arbitn must be answered.  Will Govt. honour arbitn awards above 21/2% in sectors wh. they control.
	Govt. must also decide what offers they will make in public sector.
	Will they keep w’in 21/2%?

H.B.	Some flexibility is necessary to growth, for individuals.  Same must be true of wages.  Can’t therefore be a rigid maximum, even for public sector.

Ch.H.	But if Govt. go above 21/2% in public sector, how can they get if inspected in private sector.

R.M.	An average of 21/2% wd. suffice.  If some higher, some must be lower.

P.T.	What does S.Ll. intend on arbitn?

H.B.	Accept award provided not retrospective.  Otherwise, system of arbitn will wrecked.

S.Ll.	Statement.  First part will go no further than H/C. 18 Dec.
End of pause:  meaning.  Can’t say anything now re arbitn:  omit it.
		Must have proposal for interim, as basis for discn.  Shall I use both %age and figure?

P.M.	Agree with I.M. – only way out is to increase prodn and earn larger incomes.  That is real purpose of N.E.D.C., which we ask T.U.C. to join.
M’while they ask us what we intend to do re pause.  In present form it can’t continue beyond end/fin. year.  What replaces it?  Ultimately policy of growth on wh. we invite T.U.C. co-opn.  But must be intermediate period of 12 mos. or more – during wh. unlikely to be much more than £500m.
Only in exceptional cases can there by any substantial increase.
Must find means of ensuring tht. no more is drawn out.  Thus, restraint.
Translated into practical terms, average of [21/2% - be refrained from mentioning the figure].

H.              x|	O.K. until you put that into writing &amp; mention the figures.  And what answer will you give to ques. of arbitration.

P.T.	But do you also say all C. Service claims will be honoured?

H.B.	There isn’t much.  2% for P.O. Engineers.  M. rate.  What else?

P.M.	They have higher merit than new claims.

P.T.	But if any are 5% or thereabouts . . . .

J.H.	Are there any?  M. rate is only 2/=.  P.O. engineers 2%.

D.E.	Don’t appear to be putting Govt. economic policy into commn in N.E.D.
Shd we say we have a no. of measures we cd. put in if you help us to get period of wage restraint.

H.	Repeated x/.

P.M.	Better therefore to give £500m. not 2½ %.

C.S.	Repeated y/.

J.M.	Support.  Effect on families of all increased charges in last 12 months plus those of measures taken on Agenda.

S.Ll.	Tactics.  Get them in on N.E.D. planning if we can.  If they won’t co-operate in an interim wages policy, get them to say so publicly.  Then we have clear responsibility for a Govt. policy.
P.M.	Then don’t put the interim policy too plainly.  No figures at all?  At least no %age.  A few millions only.

H.B.	Concern about C. Service unless we can say something definite pretty soon.

S.Ll.	Believe we cd. w’out danger let the dammed up claims go into effect at end of pause.  Say what will happen when pause ends.  But must move on to interim policy.

Ch.H.	Practical ques. remains:  what bearing has this paper on the pending claims of rlways., nurses etc.
	Can we hope to get TU.C. into N.E.D. and then at once announce a firm Govt. policy for interim.

J.H.	We cd. deal with pending claims on individual merits &amp; let pattern emerge.

E.P.	Nurses are claiming 30%.  How am I to brief the employers’ side?
They have at least an implied right to arbitration.

H.B.	Believe T.U.C. mght. agree to 21/2% - tho’ individual Unions wd. prob. not conform.

R.M.	Advantage to have T.U.C. endorsement if we cd. get it.

M.	Is it?  No responsibility of T.U.C. to deal with wages.

P.M.	Two issues:   a) Is it better to put paper in general terms, as I indicated:
			        or is it better to try to get T.U.C. endorsement of
				somethg. like 21/2% for next period?

S.Ll.	z?/  Put 3 alternatives to T.U.C. without the figures in any.
	If they rejected all, our field of manoeuvre wd. be clearer.
	Cd at least say they had a chance to advise us.

I.M.	Dislike both money &amp; %.  Avoid both.
	a./   T.U.C. can’t bind Unions on wages.

P.M.	Must say we are intending to end pause.

S.Ll.	On a./.  This is battle for opinion.   If T.U.C. endorsed any formula, this wd. strengthen employer and effect on arbitrator.
	They won’t enter N.E.D. w’out some indication of policy on wages.

H.W.	Support z/.

P.M.	Pause must end if somethg. reasonable can be substituted.
	Intentns on p.sector near commitments.
	Thereafter not much scope for increases over next period before growth.
Takg. hard cases and dammed up, there won’t be much for others.
How much?  How wd. you put it?  The 3 alternatives w’out figures.
Seek your views on this.  Period:  looks like 1962 (calendar)

	2.	Railway Wages.

E.M.	a.	Beeching wdn’t make a “silly” offer.  Wd not start below 5%.
b.	T.U.’s wdn’t accept split offer.
c.	They wd. suggest arbitn; and wd. ask B.T.C. to promise to honour award.

S.Ll.	Premature to debate this now.  Much depends on genl. talks with T.U.C.
Rlway. Unions are pretty responsible over it.  Mght. delay further if T.U.C. were going along with general talks.

Ch.H.           x|	S.Tel. story came from rlway. unions.  3% from April 1st.

K.	Put that into figure of money under course (c).

E.M.	Mtg. with Unions is 2 wks ahead.  23/1/62.

P.M.	x/ wd. be fair.  How do we approach that?

D.E.	Not solely a wage problem.  Size of deficit is so great.  Can’t reduce it w’out lower seat of operation, &amp; improving efficiency by enabling him to raise standard of employees.

I.M.	c) means safer than arbitn.  On latter we wd. have to promise to respect award:  the men wd. not.  If sensible award, men wd. strike.
	Wd Beeching play on c)?
	Limit cost of award to Ty., but let him make up whatever balance he may need by economies &amp; greater efficiency.
	
	3.	Miners’ Wages.

R.W.	Miners’ claim will now come before rlways.
	Rubens will decline concession on hours:  but wants to make offer on pay related to some date in spring – prs. March.  7/6d on £9.10.0. if piece-rates are held.  £15m. in all.  About 21/2%.
