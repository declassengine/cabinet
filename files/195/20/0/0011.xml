	Ghana:  Queen’s Visit.	[Enter  M.R.

P.M.	Gratitude (of Cab.) to D.S. for undertaking visit at short notice.
		Also trial run &amp; public appearance of Nk., wh. only a
		Minister cd. have done.  V. good effect on public opinion 
		here.

D.S.	Nec. to demonstrate to U.K. public tht. we were taking explosions
		as serious new development.
	Two tasks  i) 2nd review of security position.  Nk., M/Interior,
		Ch. Police.  Our N.S.Yd repves:  Jones &amp; Fergusson-Smith.,
		M.I.5. liaison offr. Jacks.,  McCabe ex-chief of Sp. Branch, 
		now its adviser.  With one exception (M.I.5) all considered
		explosions involved no addl risk;  &amp; M.I.5 repve later changed
		his mind on this.  Purpose (my view) to secure cancelln of
		visit thus humiliate Nk.  [M.I.5. thesis tht. because source
		of new development unknown it is new factor:  &amp; might 
		encourage others to have a bash.]   Precautions:  N.S.Yd
		satisfied with character, scale &amp; efficiency.
			Our Press attitude has caused grief, as well as annoyance –
		havg. regard to enormous expense incurred by Ghana.  Have
		lectured them on this, locally.
			ii)  Practical demonstration that Nk. can show his face in
		public – after notice.  Proved tht. vast majority are keenly in
		favour of Nk.
	Advise we adhere to our decision:  no additional risk.
			iii)  Rumour of w’drawal from C’wealth – as in para. 4 of
		Accra. No. 63.  Decorations etc., on C’wealth model:  emphasis
		on Queen as Head of C’wealth.
			W. Paper.  Assurances from Nk. tht. it will contain no
		serious allegns v. Br. - &amp; promise to let me see it in advance.

R.A.B.	My informn corroborates D.S. report.  N.S.Yd only anxiety is over
		ex-Ghana Ministers now in Togoland.
	No doubt tht. row shd. go fwd.

K.	Agree.

Hail.	Strongly of opinion we shd. not advise any change of plan.

J.M.	Gbedemah

D.S.	Disappeared.  Thought to be in Lagos or U.S.

H.	D.S. journey carries conviction.  Wd be almost imposs. for H.M. to
		remain Head of C’wealth if she w’drew from this.

P.M.	Tho’ risk is not more than usual, people don’t realise how great the
		normal risk is.
	Tho’ no greater for her, much greater for us – in view of public
		anxiety which has now been raised.
	Parly opinion.  Looked y’day as tho’ we mght. have back-bench
		revolt (60-80) which, if exploited by Labour, might result in a
		defeat.  Wd be v. awkward:  I cdn’t reverse my advice;  she wd.
		appear to have flouted Parlt.  Press last p.m. and this a.m. may
		have improved situation.

D.S.	Bad effect in Ghana of any H/C. debate.

I.M.	Y’day no doubt tht. adjournment wd. have bn. demanded, and
		many wd. have voted v. us.  “Going to a place where there
		is some danger and with which they have no sympathy.”

P.M.	Saw J. Morrison:
