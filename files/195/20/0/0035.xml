  <content>C.C. 9(62).					25th January, 1962.

	1.	Angola.		[Enter  M.R., Perth.

H.	Moderates among Afro-Asians regard this as victory for them.
		No sanction:  doesn’t ask for new action:  no direct 
		disapproval of P.  Sponsored already by 40 countries.
	If we put fwd. resoln of our own, we shd. be with S.A. &amp; P. only.
		We have tried to separate ourselves from P.’s colonial policy.
	Tho’ I detest the language, I conclude we shd. vote for it because of
		our wider interests.

P.M.	Para. 5 not so dangerous:  2 is distasteful:  9 we can wear because
		we give P. arms only for N.A.T.O. purposes.
	What of U.S.?

H.	They will prob. vote for it.  If they don’t, we need not.

D.S.	Support H.’s concln.  Many resolns we can’t wholly support.  We must
		vote for resolns of wh. broad substance is acceptable to us.
	Cd we not get in earlier on drafting so as to influence wording.

P.	In terms of our territories such a resoln wd. put us in gt. diffies.
		cf. para. 4. – Kenyatta, Bandi etc.  Para. 3 also.
	If we support this, what do we do when we are put in same dock.
		Hope we shall abstain.

D.S.	Abstention won’t prevent them from tabling similar resoln about our
		Colonies.

H.	Ready to vote v. resoln containg. sanctions.
	They will hunt us.  But, if we go along over this, some of them will be
		more likely to support us – when our turn comes.

D.S.	Some Africans are beginning to distinguish betwn. our Colonies &amp; the
		Portuguese.

P.T.	Can’t ignore P.’s view.
		Is it right to support this resoln v. our oldest Ally, recently the 
		victim of aggression by one of its sponsors.
	Cd we not table our own resoln.  Better be alone &amp; right than wrong in
		a great company.

D.E.	Angola is part of metropolitan Portugal.  Why support para. 5 – which 
		doesn’t apply even in P. itself.

R.A.B.	What of future of Alliance, in view of S. speech?

H.	Think we shall have to review 1899 Agreement, even if we leave
		Treaty.  This resoln wdn’t affect that.
P.	On earlier resolns we abstained.

H.	Abstention did us so much damage tht. I said in Parlt. tht. in future we
		wd. apply ourselves to the substance of resolns, not wording.

D.S.	In U.N. &amp; the world this resoln will be taken to mean only tht. we don’t
		approve of P.’s Colonial policy.

S.Ll.	Reservations wd. be made on particular points e.g. para. 4.

H.	Yes.

F.E.	Our friends have probably made this much easier for us.   [Exit  R.A.B.

I.M.	Agree.  Cpd. with many other resolns, this is mild.  Wd not wish to be
		alone with S.A. &amp; P. in standing aside from it.

P.M.	Take it broadly – is it more in accord with our image to vote with or
		v. this.

H.                x|	Suggest P.D. recalls my speech in H/L. in reln to substance;  make
                      |		exception for 3, 4 and “speedy” in 7;  and then vote for it.

P.	Second condition would help me.
			Agreed:  as at x/.

	2.	United Nations:  Bond Issue.

H.	Favour statement as in para. 3 – amended.
	Timing.  We cd. wait until debate if you send message to Mr K. 
		asking him not to make request to us which might leak.
	M’while, F.O. spokesman wd. say we supported this plan in 
		principle:  don’t yet say what we will buy or not.

P.M.	Make it conditional also on contns being f’coming from others.
		Amendment suggested and approved.

E.H.	Announce in reply to P.Q. – on day of debate.
