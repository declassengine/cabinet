  <content>C.C. 70(61).					11th December, 1961.

					[Enter  M.R., J.A.,
	Congo.				   Devonshire.

P.M.	Cabinet’s decision of Thursday p.m. – communicated to U.N. 
		Secretariat that night.

E.H.	U.N. thght. 8-9 days requd to take delivery of bombs – wh. are 
		nr. N.hampton.  Bunche had prev. said use wd. be restricted to 
		aircraft &amp; airports.  H. asked for this assurance in writing.  They
		then said (Fri.) they had in mind to use for wider purposes.  We
		said we cdn’t supply for those purposes.  They then accepted
		our request for narrow assurances.  They promised to give
		instns accordingly to U.N. Commanders.
		Sunday:  concerned at statement attribd to Linner [Tel. 276 from
		Stockholm].  Asked Sec. Genl. to repudiate this.  He issued
		statement (N.Yk. Tel. 2443) which recites U.N. policy but w’out
		repudiating statements by his subordinates.  Second part of
		para. 4. seems to disclose intention to gain control of Katanga as
		a whole.  U. Thant in final sentences pf para. 4 seems to invite 
		someone to mediate between Tshombe and U.N.

P.M.	Bomb ques. has brought to a head the difficulty we are in about the
		policy of U.N. generally.  Local U.N. people are inclining twds.
		a tougher line than S. Genl.

E.H.	H.’s believed Thurs. decn was right at the time:  but diff. now to avoid
		doubts about diffces in attitude betwn. us &amp; U.N.  We are inclined
		think.

J.A.	Targets:  a few light aircraft dispersed.  These bombs wd. not be 
		effective save v. heavy concentn of aircraft.  Nor useful v.
		kind of runway in Katanga.  These weapons are not suitable for
		the purposes to wh. our conditions restrict them.

R.M.	My impressions gained in Salisbury confirm this.  High feeling.
		If U.N. get these bombs, fear they will be used for other 
		purposes.

P.M.	If we go back on our decn, we shd. have to re-open policy ques.
		in Sec. Council &amp; mght. have to w’draw our support for U.N. 
		operation.

K.	In Nigeria &amp; Ghana there is already feeling we have not supported
		U.N.  U.S. are under-writing U. Thant.  Welensky’s statement
		is violently anti-American.  If we appear to change our decision,
		we shall be accused of dithering under pressure from 
		Katanga lobby.
S.Ll.	Can we work for Anglo-U.S. offer of mediation?
E.H.	U. Thant has suggested Dunnett (Consul in Elizabethville) as 
		mediator.  He is ascertaining from his commanders their
		minimum terms for cease-fire.  And wd. then be ready to
		empower D. to act.  Diff. to associate U.S. Consul with him
		because not on terms with Ts.
	Wd prefer heavy outside figure.

S.Ll.	E.g. an ex-President of U.N. – like Pearson.

J.H.	Case for U. Thant going himself.

P.T.	Confused accounts fr. K. – deferring despatch of bombs.  Safer than
		suggesting we have doubts re U.N. policy as a whole.

H.B.	Linner’s statement is a new fact, which enables us to say we can’t
		send bombs until sitn cleared up.

I.M.	If L.P.S. can say bombs have not left &amp; wdn’t in any event go for
		several days, there will be no adjournment debate to-day.
	For Thursday’s debate.  We can’t reverse decn on bombs because
		of techn. grds. which we shd. have bn. aware of then.  Defend
		decn on basis of assurances we asked for – grave decn to refuse
		help to protect our C’wealth men etc., in U.N. forces.  But
		doubts have arisen since because statements made by 
		Linner etc.

J.A.	Cd we rely on report tht. airfields are now clear.  (N. Yk. 2401.)

P.M.	W’ton 3348.  Rusk’s statement of U.N. objectives.  Acceptable to us.
		We cd. say we stand on that.

R.A.B.	Stick to E.H.’s statement of Mon. last – on political objectives.

K.	If we are satisfied tht. U.N. in Katanga are in line with U.N. in 
		N. Yk. the bombs shd. be delivered.

P.M.	To be used for purposes we stipulated if condns for that use shd. recur.

E.H.	After spkg. to H. in N. Yk.  Rusk’s view:  U.N. Forces shd. take 
		purely defensive role.  Pearson as conciliator.  Suggd we say tht.
		until sitn clarified (i) U.T.’s statement  ii) on ground) bombs
		won’t go.  Agreed tht. we cd. say they cdn’t go before end/week:
		m’while must get sitn clarified by debate in S. Council.

P.M.	Say:  decn stands:  but must be satisfied tht. assumptns (N. Yk.)
		&amp; condns (Katanga) are fulfilled.
