  <content>C.C. 56(61).					17th October, 1961.

	1.	Berlin.			[Enter  M.R.

H.	de G.’s veto on mtg. of F.O. officials.  My tel. to Rusk.  U.S., tho’
		shaken by Fr. attitude, are willing tht. I shd. say we think proving
		talks shd. continue &amp; that U.S. agree with that view.
	Fear it means tht. de G. does not want negotiations.
	President K. wants to bring French along &amp; is delaying Thompson’s
		return to Moscow.
	Adenauer has accepted Prs. K’s message.

H.W.	P.N. Ques. to-day:  Opposn will attack on basis of lessons of Opern
		Spearpoint:  suggesting we rely too much on nuclear &amp; tht. we
		are out of line with N.A.T.O. strategy.  Unreadiness of B.A.O.R.

I.M.	Many P.N.Q.’s are being sought.

	2.	Common Market:  Paris Meeting.

E.H.	Re-action to my speech in Paris as good as cd. be expected.
	The Six were taken aback by our explicit assurance to E.F.T.A. &amp; by
		complexity of C’wealth aspects.
	Mtgs. – for early Nov. – officials &amp; Ministers.
		They will be long in reachg. agreemt. inter sc.

	3.	Queen’s Speech:  Opening of Parliament.	[Enter  E.P.

P.M.	Add any reference to capital gains tax?

S.Ll.	Not quite certain we can do it in advance of Finance Bill.  Unwise therefore to mention it.  Mght. be able to announce in debate on Address.

P.M.	Great moral advantage on wage pause.

			Agreed:   omit from Speech.

I.M.	Weights &amp; Measures.  Don’t mention in Speech – but don’t drop it
		now from p’mme.  Give ourselves room for manoeuvre.

P.M.	Also because may be a stormy session:  don’t therefore promise too
		much – to avoid charge of inability to carry out your promises.

I.M.	Endless scope for diffy on this Bill if Oppn want to make trouble.

F.E.	Important reform:  we shall be criticised if we don’t go on with it, 	Oppn won’t crab it:  helps shoppers.

R.A.B.	Bound to be asked about it in Debate on Address.
H.B.	Strong appeal to l.g. circles and consumers:  hope we shall get it.

M.R.	Room for this is Capital Gains doesn’t start at once.
		But Party will prefer tht. Speech shd. give appearance tht.
		p’mme is lighter.

			Agreed:  omit from Speech.		[Exit  E.P., E.H.

	4.	Army Man-Power.

H.W.	As in memo.  Combination of two proposals would see us thro’ 62/63.
		Volunteer element in Reserve (from A.E.R. or T.A.) who wd.
		come up in time of tension – wd. be a valuable start in reform of
		Reserve.

P.M.	Discussed by Def. Cttee.  Recommend adherence to concept of regular
		forces.  Advise legn to give permissive power to retain N.S. men
		for 6 months more &amp; to call back specialists.

H.	Commitments unlikely to be lessened in next 2 years.  Assent to first
		2 proposals.  Doubt, however, wtr. 3rd proposal will ensure
		adequate balance in forces throughout the world.

S.Ll.	Dislike financial cost, but admit need for first two proposals.

D.S.	1957 plan has bn. upset mainly because we have bn. unable to make
		the planned redn in B.A.O.R.  If we have to keep 55.000 men 
		there indefinitely, we can’t do it on voluntary system.

H.	Both we and U.S. want to reduce our forces in G;  but it will have to
		be considered wtr. we want G. army to dominate Eur.

R.A.B.	First 2 proposals will help me, on civil emergency, by producing more
		troops in U.K.

C.S.	Army at 160.000 won’t be efficient peace-time force because gaps 
		in it.  You need 180.000 on 1957 deployment.  Will take 3 years
		to reach that level.  We accepted this “gap”.  But problem has 
		bn. aggravated because commitments have not bn. reduced as
		assumed.  84 units abroad now &amp; 40 at home:  as cpd. with
		roughly 50/50 basis of 1957 plan.  Will affect regular 
		recruitment in the end.
	1st proposal will give us 180.000 until Oct. ’62;  but will then fall
		sharply.
	We must therefore decide we shall cut commitments to somethg. like
		1957 order of battle plans or we must consider re-introducg. N.S.

P.M.	I have bn. working on reduced commitments – partly for this reason
		&amp; partly for cost.

H.W.	If we are to avoid being driven into N.S., by failure, we must show
		determination to succeed in working with all regular forces –
		incldg. redn of commitments.

			Approved:  first &amp; second proposals.

H.W.	Reservists.  Simplest remedy wd. be to remove requirement of 
		Proclamation;  but satisfied tht. this wd. be breach of faith to
		reservists – who have always understood they wd. not be 
		re-called except for fighting.  Ideally therefore need to re-shape
		whole reserve.  This wd. take so long tht. we propose the 
		voluntary experiment.  You cd. get it into this Bill w’out adding
		to controversy.  On balance I favour incldg. it because it does not
		leave whole burden on the N.S. men.

P.M.	Berlin situation wd. warrant Proclamation.  But this (in Aug.) wd. have
		enhanced tension.  Thought to be equivalent (modern) of
		mobilisation.

J.P.	Welcome such a start on reforming reserves.  But wrong to support
		we shall get v. many volunteers for it.

H.W.	We haven’t tested how many men wd. volunteer for period/tension.
		Only an instalment.  But wd. show we were making a start.

R.A.B.	Essential to revise concept of emergency:  existg. statutory 
		definition is not in accord with modern conditions.

P.T.	Dangerous public position if v. few enrol.

J.H.	Reservists don’t like re-joining &amp; then hanging about – cf. our 
		experience over Suez.

			Agreed:  further study of 3rd proposal, includg. drafting,
				      &amp; further discussion by Cabinet.
				W.O. to be responsible for Bill.		[Exit  J.P.

	5.	Shipping;  Cunard Liners.

E.M.	Chairman Cunard doesn’t now wish to cancel, but to p’pone.
		Seen him, with Mills.  Made it clear tht. ques. of commercial
		judgment are for him.
	Cunard statement to be made on Thursday.  I shall then have to make
		a statement in H/C.  Also to tell Chandos.  Several tenders are
		below £30 m. – so he can’t use that excuse.

P.M.	New situation:  must reserve Govt.’s freedom to consider it on merits.
			Formula on this basis to be agreed between E.M., I.M.
				and Ty.	[Exit  H.W., H.and S.Ll.

	6.	Teachers’ Salaries.

D.E.	Teachers have decided to strike on 24/10 and demonstrate in Ldn.
		Also to w’draw services of supervision in meal-breaks
		from 1/11.  L.a.’s have asked if payment to others (for meals)
		wd. rank for grant.  I said “no”.  L.a.’s thus stiffened to make
		agreement with teachers.  Hold mtg. y’day with both sides,
		l.a.’s said they wd. start negotns for new salaries – in mid 1962
		to operate from spring of ’63.  I didn’t guarantee that.  N.U.T.	
		have decided to propose acceptance of £42 m., calling off strike.
		But they want me to p’pone my legn – at least till after Xmas.
		I have said I will introduce Bill on 31/10 unless they have given 
		way before then.

P.M.	This seems v. satisfactory.
						[Enter  J.H.

	7.	Euston Station.

E.M.	H.A. Cttee decision.  Announced July.  No fuss until now.
		Alleged it cd. be rolled elsewhere for £90.000.  Raising a fund.

J.H.	Has historical &amp; aesthetic interest.  Shd we stop others from raising
		funds.

E.M.	They have not raised £1.000.

H.B.	No chance of their submitting viable scheme.

			Agreed:   stand firm.
