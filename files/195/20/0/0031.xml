	1.	Laos.		[Enter  M.R.

H.	Geneva Conf. succeeded.  But Princes can’t agree.  Phouma’s proposed Cabinet is acceptable to U.S. – but Phoumi won’t accept.  Co-Chairmen have called 3 Princes to Geneva.  If he is still obdurate, all we can do is to send him back with Mr. Macdonald to confront King.  No other possibility.  If it fails, fighting will be resumed.  U.S. are now putting real pressure on Phoumi.

P.M.	A year ago we promised to support armed intervention.  But then we were able to secure change in U.S. policy.  It will be diff. to go back now to support of SEATO intervention.  We aren’t bound by our old commitment.  We might make that clear to U.S.

H.	Will submit memo to bring Cab. up to date.

	2.	Congo.

H.	Bit quieter.  Exchange of prs. (K. &amp; Congo).  Due mainly to fact that 2 sensible U.N. officials are on better terms with J.  Must press U.N. not to move Urquhart:  Smith already moved.
	Kizunga opn went well.  U.N. troops stood by but didn’t have to intervene.  K. now out of picture.
	Promising if T. sticks to Kitona pact - &amp; if U.N. refrain from hunting mercenaries by force.

E.H.	M.T.’s aim:  to promote conciln &amp; work twds. w’drawal of U.N. forces.  But he has to keep assuring Afro-Asians that he will continue to carry out resolns.

H.	Need for police vice troops.  Nigeria might help.

H.	U.T. drafted bad lr. to R.W.  We asked him to refrain fr. writing &amp; give us name of his repve which we will pass on.

	3.	Indonesia.

H.	Raid y’day, intercepted by Dutch.  But there have bn. similar raids before.  Might be start of fighting.
	We must now suspend [deliveries] licences for arms exports.

M.	Shd we suspend or revoke?  Second course wd. involve publicity.
	Cdn’t m’tain suspension beyond re-assembly of H/C.
	Agreed tht. we grant no new licences.

P.M.	Gannets:  due to go 17/i.  Also:  engine which is spare to those &amp; they have taken delivery but no export licence granted.

H.	Awkward to let these go now, when fighting may be about to start.

M.	A no. of other countries have publicly revoked licences.

H.W.	Gannet has an offensive capacity.

M.	Last 2 of order of 16.

P.M.	Recommend:
		i)	we grant no more export licences (for arms).
		ii)	suspend or cancel licences (for arms) granted but not executed.
		iii)	let Gannets go, on basis that Indonesians already own them.
	Then try to limit publicity to i) and ii):  as temporary measure until situation clears – in terms of war-like stores.  The spare engine for Gannets shd. similarly be allowed to go.

	4.	Berlin.

H.	Concln in memo. somewhat speculative.  But impressed by permanent “frontier” between W. Berlin and E. Germany.  May be that, having sealed off W. Berlin, they will lose interest in negotns.  Not sure which way they will play it.  Grom. was v. tough in 2nd talk with Thompson.  But not sure.  There are other matters wh. do interest R. e.g. sovereignty of D.D.R.  Next step:  see if U.S. will agree tht. T. shd. open up on some of these &amp; see wtr. R. respond.  If they don’t, may mean tht. R. prefer status quo for time being.
	Our immediate aim:  persuade U.S. to agree to a 3rd interview by T.

M.	Weakness of our position – based on continuing mil. occupn, which ultimately makes no sense.

S.Ll.	Pity T. isn’t free to canvass more freely.

P.M.	Because of commitments we have accepted to F. and G.

H.	Choice:  go on with talks over months or call a F.M. mtg.  Wd need to be sure how far we cd. get in latter.

P.M.	Remember:  Br. people wdn’t willingly go to war over W. Berlin.  Nor does Mr. K. wish to do so.  But risk of Genl. Clay &amp; contingency planning – may get us into v. real diffies.  Who is going to bill that cat?
	If K.’s position is being eroded, it may be better to do business with him while he is still available.  Alternative would be worse.

H.	Can’t risk letting these talks get quite bogged down.

S.Ll.	Cd co-Chairmen for Laos meet to discuss that &amp; swop views on this?

	5.	Incomes Policy.                  [Enter  E.P., P.M.G., R.W. &amp; Thompson.

	a)	Arbitration.
S.Ll.	As in memo.
	Third course.  With no attempt to define comparability – tho’ I fear that in full emplt. Comparability in full sense isn’t tolerable.  We must concentrate on trying to create atmosphere in which arbitrators will need natl interest.  If that fails, we may have to go back to course 1.

H.B.	There wd. also be reservation v. retrospection.
	We retn to public service, para. 5 of C. 10.
	My informn is tht. I shan’t be pressed to-day on 4(b) if I can give assurance on 4(a).

P.M.G.	National interest shd. be put fwd. in negotns &amp; in arbitn in C. Service, tho’ that does encroach on full comparability.

M.	Need for care in formula about relation to increased prodn.

H.B.	I shall stand on S.Ll.’s M to T.U.C.

J.M.	Para. 7. of C.10.  Diffy here.  Shall encounter injustice if this is rejected.

H.B.	Shan’t face it at once:  for non-industrial C.S. have no claim over 1 year old.

J.H.	Support papers 9 &amp; 10.
	But first aim must be to get private sector on right lines (so that comparability may become manageable).

H.W.	Service pay.  Period for review:  up to July ’61.  Proposals shd. be publd in Feb.  On true comparability:  4% for officers = 14% o. ranks.  Tho’ for 2 yrs., latter is larger.  Recruiting trend must not be reversed.  By part debates we are deeply pledged to comparability.  Shd like now to discuss with Ty. Ministers.

S.Ll.	Yes:  on basis of memo. agreed between Ty. and M/D. officials.

P.T.	Danger of our policy:  wd. collapse at end/pause.  If it does, v. serious criticism from Party.  Memo. proposes to revert to arbitn:  tho’ national interest is to be argued.  Look at proposals which are ahead in natd indies – 4% and more.  If these went to arbitn, no matter what Ty. say in civil service cases, no hope of 2½% average.

H.B.	“Go back” to arbitn.  We have never w’drawn it, even in pause.  V. drastic to do even more in following period.  If we tried to do so, no chance of getting T.U.C. to join N.E.D.C.
			…………  [5 minutes not heard.]

S.Ll.	In natd indies we shd. try for 2½%.  In coal mines we shd. try to get award representg. 2½% over industry as a whole.

R.W.	Somethg. between 2½ and 3% overall wd. be tolerable to N.C.B.  But diff. for them to decline arbitn if men ask for it.

P.M.	We must avoid that.  He can’t reject award if made at arbitn:  but he can refuse to have arbitn.  He must refuse - &amp; face a strike if need be.  Agreed.

S.Ll.	Gas.  Electricity award = about 5%.  Gas normally follows.  Gas Bd. want to avoid trimmings &amp; wd. like to offer 4% on hourly rate.  I have suggested going to arbitn &amp; trying to get less than 5%.  They are reluctant because tradition to reach negotiated settlement.

R.W.	Might persuade him to offer small figure &amp; then go to arbitn, so long as he can rely on Govt.’s view of what is permissible in national interest.

S.Ll.	Am seeing him this week &amp; will press this strongly on him.  Gas industry is only breakg. even:  cd. not afford more.

E.M.	Railways.  B.T.C. sees Union Tuesday.  No strike w’out arbitration.  Neither side bound to accept award.

E.H.	But ’58 they struck w’out arbitn.

S.Ll.	Can’t authorise B. to offer 6%.  Alternatives i) offer nothing &amp; suggest arbitn.  This wd. handicap moderate T.U. leaders.  ii) Make small offer, not above 2%, and go to arbitn w’out saying in advance we wd. accept award.

M.	Beeching won’t do that.

S.Ll.	But we have more evce now of Unions’ views.  Viz., tht. they don’t expect much &amp; aren’t willing to strike.

P.M.	B. not willing to make derisory offer.  If we require him to do so, he may resign.  But wd. he operate on “banker’s limit”?

E.H.	Diff. if known to Unions tht. B.T.C. think they shd. have more.  They wd. then go to arbitn, at which B.T.C. wdn’t fight v. hard.  First arbitn since we accepted Gilleband – and evident now tht. we don’t for a limit is not consistent with that.

S.Ll.	Addl supplementary for rlways, bringing total to £155 m.

M.	Unreal to suggest there’s no more money:  obviously there is, in Ty.

J.H.	Agree with S.Ll.  Posn  has moved since last talk with B.  Reason for him to take a more ‘national’ view.
P.M.	Can’t we now persuade him to try for settlement at 3%.

P.T.	Great danger in arbitn:  B. who thinks 6%:  Unions askg. 12%:  and tribunal with t. of r. invitg. Gilleband solution.

E.M.	Can’t hope to hold rlways. back when gas already gone ahead:  for rlways. are already too far behind other natd industries.

P.M.	It cd. be managed if rlway. wages were not on national basis.  That cd. be brought out in arbitn.  Pave the way for getting away from national rates.
			Try to get him to seek settlement at 3%.
			If he won’t, put course (ii) above.

	Busmen.
S.Ll.	Play this out until result on rlways. is known.

E.M.	I agree.

	University Staffs.
H.B.	Last increase Jan. ’60.  U.G.C. dissuaded a year ago from putting in further claim because of teachers’ claim.  They eventually submitted in July recommn for 17% from Aug. 1961.
	One thing clear:  any increase shd. date from Aug. 62.
	Ty. view on merits:  case for 8 or 9% tho’ U.G.C. wd. not endorse much less than 17%.  E.P.C. divided:  majority felt that Univ. expansion shd. be jeopardised rather than wages policy:  not more therefore than 3%.  Ascertained tht. U.G.C. re-action to that wd. be as set out in memo. paras 12-13.  Stress para. 13.  U.G.C. also said Robbins shd. be informed in advance.

R.A.B.	Element of pre-pause commitment.  Teachers and C.A.T.S.  Views of Murray, who is reliable.
	What about para. 10. – 3% rising over years to 9%.

H.B.	Murray thinks that is worse.

P.M.	Competition with C.S.

J.H.	Agree:  my informn is state Universities are not yet in diffy over recruitment.

E.H.	They made the same noises 2 yrs. ago:  and tho’ we didn’t do all they asked consequences did not follow.

Hail.	56% increase in teachers over 8 yrs. is plan.  No chance of getting these numbers if C.A.T.S. pay more – let alone C. Service.
	Importance of securing University expansion.

J.H.	17% wd. be reverting to full comparability.  Wd wreck general policy.

H.B.	My plan = 50% redn in U.G.C. claim.

E.P.	If 8% offered, Health Ministers can’t get [l.a.’s] to       [Enter  K.
	Offer 3% to nurses.

H.B.	Nurses last increase was only 1 yr. ago:  &amp; comparison is with non-graduate teachers.
	Easier to present this as rounding-off of award to teaching profn &amp; separate from manual workers.  Necessary for expansion p’mme.

S.Ll.	Presentn of 9%:  say that it wasn’t part of pay pause, but of teachers.  Two stages.

R.A.B.	Argument suggests there is more in my plan of 3% now rising gradually to 9%.

Ch.H.	If real argument is recruiting, escalating scale is valuable.

R.W.	Can we present it as pre-pause commitment.

S.Ll.	No.

R.A.B.	But they may bring it out, critically.
