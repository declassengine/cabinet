  <content>C.C. 72 (61)					13th December, 1961

	1.	Nutritional Services.		[Enter B.C., E.P.

	Welfare Milk.

H.B.	No Ty. reason for immediate decisions.
	To get 21/2% target, we shall need some major cut – this is most promising field.  Work of Offl. Cttee - £97m.
	Best scheme in my view:  school meals (para. 8) x.1.  £27m saving at no nutritional cost.  Coupled with para. 10 y.1. – w’drawing 4d pint subsidy on welfare milk save for larger families:  £20m. saving.
No action on school milk, which wd. continue to be free.
	If that were not accepted, I wd. have to press for legn on f. allowances – saving £35m. by terminating allowance for 2nd child &amp; increasing if for 3rd and over.  (B.C. That figure is not net of tax loss).  Prs. 28-29m. Net.
	Mp reference is for first course.

E.P.	Believe y.1. is right.  Tho’ I wd. include 3 child family all under 5. (at cost of £1m-2m.)
		With that adjustmt., no nutritional loss.
	This scheme is not defensible – subsidising milk bill of many families who wd. drink so much if there were no subsidy.  We wd. do better to be more selective.  I proposed a scheme of this kind a year ago.
V. ready to defend this, w’out regard to economy drive.

J.M.	Broadly agree:  wd. like to discuss with E.P. his modification in detail.

J.B.C.	Slight adminve addl. cost in the modificn.

C.S.	Food distn:  we depend on distribution to handle this more complicated plan.  Shd wish to consult them before announcement.

E.P.	Subject to leaks.

H.B.	Consumptn 198.  Assumed tht. 60m. less wd. be consumed under this plan.
With modificn prs. 40m. maximum.  This on assumption that the families will cut consumptn.  

M/H. 	Doubt if they will.

D.E.	[Need we continue to give free milk to independent schools. Costs £180m.]

I.M.	Y.1. modified mght. cost £8m.
	Y.2. wd. cost £12m.  But wd. be simpler to administer &amp; more popular.
Cd we keep this open?
E.P.	Timing.  Hosp. W. Paper due around 20/1.  Awkward to do this about this time.  Wd prefer to do this first – so tht. bad precedes good news.

J.M.	Cd we not aim at genl. announcement of cuts?

H.B.	See para. 12.  Either y.1. or y.2. wd. be simpler to administer than present scheme.

E.P.	Powers expire in 1964.  Can’t hope to abolish all welfare milk then.
Easier to continue a scheme wh. is defensible nutritionally.  This is an argument for y.1. modified.

R.A.B.	We shall have to think in terms of y.l.a.

	School Meals.

D.E.	Merits.  on nutrition:  we believe 10-20% fall in up-take.  Prs 1/2m. children wd. get some other meal – not necessarily so good.  For many wd. go home:  esp. in rural areas.  Meals in cafès bad socially.
	Not therefore to be assumed there wd. be no nutritional loss.
	Educational disadvantages.  Teachers accept duty to supervise meals because seen tht. it has educational advantage.  With charge of 2/= teachers wd. be disposed to regard it as restaurant service, and decline to supervise.
		If you have meals service, you must close the school mid-day break.
Mght. therefore have to pay for supervisors vice teachers.  Hard to find them.  Wd cost £1/2m p.a.
	Parly Secy &amp; P.M.G. (experienced in schools in Lpl.) think 2/= wd. be disastrous.  At 1/6d I cd. still m’tain this was not restaurant service.
Wd want to work out a new kind of means-test.

H.B.	This is most costly service £57m.  V. large nos. of parents can afford to pay full cost.  To make them do so will greatly ease our diffies elsewhere.
	D.E.’s plan wd. at best save on £17m.  Vice my £27m.

R.A.B.	x.1. (b) is pretty difficult.

H.B.	It wd. need detailed thought.

J.M.	Earlier adjustmts.   ’53.  2d increase:  65% drop in up-take.
			             ’57.  2d increase:  14.7% drop.
They climb back, but v. slowly.
	Concerned at risk tht. teachers won’t co-operate.
	Not a v. serious nutritional ques., however.  Mainly political – how much row can we face?  Subject to that, ready to accept x.1.

H.B.	’51: 37% now 33%.  Scotl.     } despite changes
	’51: 50% now 54%   Engl.      } in charges.

R.A.B.	If only 1/6. can you charge 6d for school milk?  (£7m)

D.E.	No:  for teachers wdn’t collect the money.
But ready to w’draw free milk fr. independent schools.

J.B.C.	Is this a family income test?  What of variation in earnings?

H.B.	There is a test now for free meals.

J.B.C.	That is left to discretion of l.a.’s.

I.M.	Don’t believe x.1 is possible because of tensions with teachers.  Also doubt if we can say there is not nutritional risk.  Finally, diffy. of operatg. means test with incomes fluctuating.
	X.2. wd. be much easier to do and to defend.

H.B.	There is a test now for free meals.  This system cd. extend to x.1. (b).
I accept argument about teachers.
	But remember that ½ in E. &amp; W. and 2/3rds don’t take these meals.

F.E.	Why not face clerical assistce for this - &amp; take it off the teachers.

D.E.	We collect money by slot machine.  It’s the supervision tht. teachers object to.
	Means test.  This wd. be major change in method.

Hail.	Diff. in practice to have 2 difft charges for same meal in a school.

M.	Will be hard to justify 100% increase.  50% much easier.

R.A.B.	Led to feel, from discussion, that x.2. wd. meet most of critical comments.
	Will Ty. put up revised proposals, in light of discussion.

H.B.	If we adopt x.2., cd. we require all to pay 6d.

D.E.	There wd. be have to be some exemptions – e.g. families on assistance.

	Family Allowances.

H.B.	Do you want me to consider this alternative?

Hail.	No.  Better to go for the other.

H.B.	What we wd. have to do is:  cut all allowance for 2nd child:  add 2/= to 3 &amp; 4 ch. family:  7/= to 5 ch. family:  &amp; more still for 6 child family.
	J.B.C. doesn’t want legn:  &amp; disputes view of Ch.Whip tht. such a reform wd. be welcome to Party.
	V. wide Bill because repercussions on N.I.

R.A.B.	Let Ty. also include bare details of what wd. have to be done on this.  J.B.C. to refrain from submittg. memo. on this.
