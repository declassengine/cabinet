  <content>C.C. 17(62).					27th February, 1962.

	1.	Foreign Affairs.		[Enter  M.R.

	(a)	Berlin.

H.	Since 22/2 R. harassing tactics have bn. dropped.  Quiet.
	Thompson is presenting another memo.  R. showing no sign of
		impatience or progress.  Shall play it out until F.M.’s meet in
		Geneva on disarmament.

	(b)	Congo.

H.	A. and T. are going to meet – prob. w’out U.S. Amb.  Looks as tho’
		they want settlement.  U.N. not pursuing m’while their plan to 
		put troops into these 2 places.  If talks brk. down this will 
		revive - &amp; may be resisted.

	(c)	Laos.

H.	P.Lao are over cease-fire line, but fighting hasn’t broken out on any
		scale.  Phouma’s proposed Govt. still unacceptable to Phoumi.
		But all are mtg. with King &amp; there may be a settlement.

	(d)	Disarmament.

H.	Looks as tho’ K. will allow F.M.’s to open Conference.  Then likely to
		be Summit – one way or other – around May – as foreshadowed 
		in P.M.’s letter.

	(e)	Europe.

E.H.	Oct. 10. said we wd. open negotns with other 2 communities at appropte
		time.  Have taken soundings – agreed time is ripe.  Propose to 
		submit formal apln at end/week:  negotns wd. then begin
		in 2 mos. time.

	2.	Education:  Burnham Committee.

D.E.	Outlined reasons for legn.  L.a.’s don’t like it – wd. weaken their posn –
		&amp; have said they wd. back teachers’ opposn unless clearly shown
		to be in line with incomes policy.  That can’t yet be shown.  They
		wd. press for arbitn, wh. wd. enforce comparability.  Want to be
		in posn to resist this – which I can’t do yet.
	Hence, prefer to p’pone legn for a time.  This may mean we wd. have
		no powers at next review.  But at this review, deadlock is likely
		&amp; it mght. suit us to say we have no power to deal with it.  Later

		the l.a.’s &amp; teachers mght. divide &amp; we mght. be under less
		pressure to include arbitn.

H.B.	Timing is nicely balanced.
	This year’s review must not yield further increase.  Teachers’ 14% is 
		already grave threat to our 2½% - it must last for a long time.
	Is it better to legislate before a clash.  Or after we have made it clear
		they are to get nil.

I.M.	Balance of argument in favour of D.E.
		In addn legn this session v. all the opposn it wd. arouse wd. be 
		v. unwise.  That seems to me to be decisive.

J.H.	Cd M/E. get agreemt. with B’ham Cttee – he doesn’t press legn:  but 
		they promise to discuss recommns with him informally before
		publn.

J.M.	If they are to get nil this summer, there will be conflict – with or w’out
		powers.  I am therefore indifferent, wtr. D.E. legislates or not.

Hail.	Will we be in any better posn to legislate next session – nearer to
		Genl. Election.

H.B.	E.P. thinks 10-11% for nurses is likely at arbitn because of teachers’
		14%.  If another rise were given to teachers, our 2½% for ’62 wd.
		be lost.

D.E.	In answer to Hail:  this won’t be politically nasty legn next session if
		it follows a deadlock in ’62.  May even be acceptable to teachers.

J.M.	In Scotland no deadlock maybe because arbitn is available.

D.E.	J.H.’s plan mght. mean no legn ever:  wd. also imply we were ready to
		give something.

			Agreed:  legn to be p’poned.

	3.	Uganda.

R.M.	Independence (self-government) due day after to-morrow – 1/3.  This
		compensation plan must be settled first.
	Remember Tanganyika, when Ty. in end had to pay more.
	On Uganda I want to offer plan nearer to Tanganyika settlement.
		Otherwise we shall be politically pressed to do it.

H.B.	T. was intolerably expensive.  Also bad precedent because suggests 
		tht. if Govt. are pressed it will yield.
	Difference £700.000 on compensation &amp; £2 m. on development.
		Uganda cd. afford to dispense with the £700.000.  Has just raised
		salaries by that amount.  Ty. satisfied £5.3 m. is enough.
		Development – bedevilled by Bank plan, which is good.  But
		in U.K. we have had to cut back on good plans.  We have offered
		enough to enable them to carry on at level higher than in
		recent yrs.
	Remember Kenya is coming along.

R.M.	Even so, I’m sure we shan’t be able to hold posn v. Parly pressure.

D.S.	I agree.  We cdn’t have settled T. for less and did no good by 
		haggling over it.

H.B.	Haven’t Govt. agreed to hold aid at a total figure?  We can’t do that,
		if D.S. argument prevails.
	Cd do a little more on compensation, if really necessary.  But can’t
		go higher on aid.

I.M.	What about x/? in memo.  W’in aid total.
	Differ from H.B.’s account of T. settlement.  My view is tht. we wd. 
		have got a lower result if Ty. had not insisted on starting too low.
		If C.O. view had bn. accepted we cd. have got a lower settlement
		than we eventually reached.

H.B.	We are already over the £180 m. figure.
	Diffce of view betwn. C.O. &amp; Ty. on Tang. negotiations.
	Rate of developmt. expre now:  £5.6 m.  Ty. offer wd. raise it to
		(?) £7.8 m. in 62/3.

P.M.	Agree with H.B. on inconsistency with aid ceiling.  But floating off
		C’wealth countries will have to take priority over e.g. Libya.

P.T.	Why shd. Uganda be exempt from need accepted by all U.K. Ministers
		to phase out development plan?

Hail.	We wd. do better to carry cost of compensation and cut back on
		development, as a general proposn in all these countries.

P.M.	Remember that if constitutional plan miscarried it wd. cost us more –
		&amp; political diffies wd. be greater.

H.B.          x/	Ready to close whole of gap on compensation.

F.E.	Support C.O. case.

C.S.	What wd. they say if we took over all obligns on compensation?

R.M.	No difference.

R.A.B.	Raise loan to £1 m. – giving 2.5 development, in addn to full
		compensation.
                 x|	P.M.		Settle finally on C.O. figures if they will.
                   |			If they won’t, w’draw it.

H.B.	Then we had better abandon our aid ceiling – we can’t control expre.

E.H.	Then will C.O. look at all future settlements.  We can’t carry these
		burdens.  W. Indies will demand a lot, I’m sure.  And they shd.
		not get it.

P.M.	Let us look at a plan covering C’wealth and foreign.

D.E.	Growth at home is being curtailed by generosity abroad.
		Difficult to gauge damage done to our b/p. by these projects.

P.M.	Proceed as at x/ above.

	4.	Federation of Rhodesia &amp; Nyasaland.

P.M.	We are bound to have trouble with R.W. – over Fedn future, if not over
		N.Rh.
	Must we have trouble with Africans too, in N.Rh.  For them equal
		%age must be gt. advantage.  Does w’drawal of Asian seat help
		v. much.  Not in itself a grievance, for Africans.
	Is there a compromise by way of making it temporary.

H.B.	Our responsibility is for N.Rh.  Shd we accept opinion of R.W. instead
		of Govr. on this matter affectg. our responsibility.  The Asian
		seat won’t be defensible in H/C. if it’s seen that no-one wants it
		save R.W.  Remember R.W. won’t be more amenable over 
		Fedn or Nyasaland because we give him this.

Hail.	Rejection by Asians themselves lets us out.  Stick to that.

K.	Argument for retn – standing by bargain with R.W.  Will 
		therefore avoid accusation of bad faith from him:  esp. as both
		points of difference will have bn. resolved v. him.  Also awkward
		to w’draw the 500 Africans.  We put it fwd. on basis of Govr.’s
		recommendns.
	Arguments against retn – increase chance of African co-opn.
		[R.W.’s public re-action has made it more diff. for us to w’draw.]
		But still leaves us in gt. diffy over our understanding with R.W.

R.M.	I will support whatever decision Cab. reach.  But I shall feel heavy
		responsibility if it goes wrong.

H.	Hard to w’draw from public posn that the 500 Africans are fit for
		upper roll.

D.S.           y/	Agree:  wd. have to put them back under pressure.

I.M.	Apart fr. this point, which will annoy Africans, the Asians will not
		be on upper roll or voting in 1st hurdle percentage.  If I were 
		African I wdn’t buy that.
S.Ll.	African co-opn will be jeopardised more by w’drawal of the 500 than
		by retention of Asian seat.

R.A.B.	Diffy of abolishing Asian seat:
		Can’t defend w’drawg. 500 Africans.
		Morally, we are too deeply involved by past agreements to make 
		more than one change.
	Will face the music if we stick to one change.

D.S.	Can’t abolish Asian seat and keep 500 Afr. on upper roll.
	No-one can be sure of African re-actions.  They may co-operate if they
		get equal %ages.  If their mood is ugly, they won’t whatever 
		we do.
	We must therefore take broader view.  Effect on Africans’ co-opn wd.
		be much greater on a/c. of removg. the 500.  Effect elsewhere
		wd. also be bad.
	y/ wd. put us in worse posn.

R.M.	W’draw my proposal to abolish Asian seat – tho’ concerned at
		consequences.  Make %age 10%.  Leave reserved seats at 4.

P.M.	R.M. is v. generous.  He has inherited a position which others of us
		made.  Good of him to appreciate diffies this has created for us.

			Agreed:  Retain Asian seat.

P.M.	Make it clear to R.W. that Cab. have considered D.S. reports of
		conversations on future of Federation &amp; cannot be regarded 
		as committed in any way to his partition plan.

			Agreed.  Announcement on N. Rhodesia to be 
			               made in H/C. on 28/2.
