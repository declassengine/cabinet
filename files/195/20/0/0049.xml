  <content>C.C. 23 (62)					22nd March, 1962

	1.	Parliament.		[Enter M.R., Dundee

I.M.	Business for next week.

	2.	Disarmament.

a)	Nuclear Test.

P.M.	Geneva:  atmosphere better than usual.  Presence of ignorant neutrals has bn. quite helpful – probing ques. addressed to Gromyko.
	Washington:  Penney/Zuckerman visit.  Disappointing.  Had hoped we cd. agree tht. national detection wd. suffice to identify suspicious events.
Insufft. evce:  one single experiment only:  U.S. research into seismology has bn. mis-directed.  But H.’s last speech cd. at least ask R. to say wtr. they were willing to accept any type of verification.  [There must be some independent check on suspicious incidents:  but less objectionable if there were no static posts on Soviet soil.]  R. has suggested small cttee:  but they have taken definite stand tht. no foreigner shall ever enter R. for any purpose of inspn.  If that is final, there can be no verification.  But at least our public position will be easier.  Probable explanation:  tht. R. are ready for another series &amp; want U.S. series to take place as an excuse.  Doubt if any purpose in another appeal to K.  Shall prob. have to say U.S. series now inevitable.  Plenary discn on this on Fri. or Mon.  No approach to K. until after that.

b)	General.

	Cttee to be appointed to ascertain common ground &amp; identify problems.
	R. posn on verification – only on destruction.

R.A.B.	Need to present this disappointing outcome to U.K. public in such a way as to make it plain that we have done our best.

D.S.	U.S. &amp; we have previously said willing to have ban on atmosph. tests.
x|	Shd  we not revive that.  Hazards to health wd. at least be 
	covered. Better for us if R. rejected that also.

P.M.	We cd. at least recall tht. we offered that &amp; R. rejected it.
	Shd I make independent effort to resolve deadlock by offering to meet K. myself.  I hv. accepted that U.K. wd. have to join in.

D.	Important tht. K. himself shd. be seen to be in support of Gromyko’s posn.

P.M.	May be better to have Summit on Berlin, where there is some scope for negotiation.  Also dangers of that situation are more imminent.
	On balance on tests alone I wd. sooner make joint appeal to K. rather than suggest a Mtg.

	3.	Aircraft Industry.	[Enter C., J.A.

P.T.	Demonstrated ‘variable geometry” with aid of a model.
Reduction of design staffs – inevitable, as is redn in size of industry.
But retreat must not become a rout.  Want therefore in to-day’s debate to announce this design project study - £1/2m over 18 months.
	W’in publd estimates.  Key advance in all aviation, civil &amp; industry.

H.B.	More than £1/2m is at stake…
	Is the political necessity over-riding?

P.T.	I am under heavy attack about the industry.
No commitment to produce an aircraft.

P.M.	Cd you not be vague?

P.T.	B.A.C. are out of design work because of my cancellations.

D.S.	Bound to be central to any advance in aircraft design.

Hail.	 Project study does not commit.

H.B.	I agree with that.  But if announced public will assume we are going to build the aircraft.

P.M.	Cd Ty. fears be met if P.T. explained in his speech what project study does involve and what it doesn’t.

P.T.	Willing to do this.
					[Exit C., J.A., Dundee

	4.	Incomes Policy.

S.Ll.	Diffy. way in which Press represent settlements in private industry.
I.C.I. and Massey Ferguson awards are actually not so bad as they were represented to be.

M.	Wages Council.  21/2-9% awards are being made.
Public haven’t understood policy – or the need for it.

Hail.	We must put our view across.  And must seize topical instances.

R.M.	We shall get into trouble if we start criticising individual firms.

P.M.	People do know:  but some don’t agree that it’s necessary and more don’t like it.

Ch.H.	Common re-action to unpopular measures tht. ‘you haven’t explained it properly’.
	But more Ministers cd. expound – instead of leaving it all to Ty. Ministers.  Need for repetition, in simple terms.

I.M.	Many feel that others are exempt – the chorus &amp; the heavy-pressure T.U.’s.  cf. Orpington.
	Ministers are speaking – but aren’t reported.  Anyhow, it’s not news.
Policy is accepted but wildly unpopular.

D.E.	New point:  change in method of settling wage claims.
Departure from comparability.

P.M.	Seize occasions (e.g. Ritchie) to correct.
Don’t make attacks on particular firms.
		Use arguments re Bank rate etc., to slow tht. policy is
			succeeding.
