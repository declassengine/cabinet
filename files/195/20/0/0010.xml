1.	Parliament.		[Enter  M.R.

I.M.	Business for next week.

	2.	Germany – Berlin.

H.M.	Developing Allied discussions on contingencies – we have bn. led
		along.  U.S. have to be reminded continuously that with us
		Parliament is sovereign, and all these plans must be subject to 
		Cab. decision at the time.  This adds to H.’s difficulties.

H.              (a)	Immediate ques. of Friedrikstrasse crossing.  Narrative in memo.
		16 yrs. U.S. have not shown passes:  Br. have shown if asked,
		but v. rarely asked.  U.S. having taken a stand on this, can’t 
		give way.  Latest plan:  Allies to require R. civilians similarly
		to show passes on entering W. Berlin.  U.S. willing to conform
		with that solution.  Best way out in present circs.  (“Civilians”
		for this purpose means or includes military personnel in 
		civilian clothes.)  Also reduce no. of our points of entry into
		W. Berlin to one – to conform with one crossing into E. Berlin.

Hail.	Uneasy about U.S. re-actions on the spot – e.g. Clay.

K.	Tel. 1147 from Berlin.  Any hope of getting pressure on Clay? – via
		Washington.

M.	You can assume  (H:   you can’t)  tht. Clay keeps in close touch with
		W’ton.   (P.M.   But Pentagon.)

H.	Solution now in view emphasises 2 Berlins – but that is a fact.

                  (b)	Corridors – air and land.
H.	Clear directive worked out with Norstad re air corridors – on re-action
		to any interference with civil aircraft in corridors.
	Suppose plane shot at from ground, N. wants fighter escort to be free
		to shoot at ground target outside built-up area w’out risk to
		civilian life.  Either i) authorise immediate retaliation or
		ii) leave opportunity to warn R. and then mount such an attack
		on any second occasion.  Second wd. give scope for a political
		decision.

H.W.	Prefer (ii).
			Agreed.

C.S.	Won’t arise:  for if civil aircraft is attacked by S.A.G.W. it will be
		destroyed (sitting duck) &amp; therefore can’t make a second trip.

H.	Land corridor.  N. wants re-action v. any block:  force to remove it &amp;
		provoke R. to fire first – after which it wd. w’draw.

H.W.	Cassel has worked out plan for a small force to do this.

H.	May have to be larger than a company.

		Agreed:  subject to H.W. vetting that the plan is realistic and safe.

S.Ll.	Shd be a small force, to avoid a situation in which loss of
		face arises.

H.W.	Under Cassel’s control:  can tell him to warn us before he acts.

                  (c)	Economic Counter Measures.
H.	Allies consider these will help to avert ultimate crisis - &amp; tht. our
		attitude in N.A.T.O. has bn. unhelpful.  Mr K. himself favours 
		this as alternative to mil. re-action.  Hence tel. in Annex B.  In
		N.A. Council y’day it emerged tht. many are nervous of total
		embargo – Canada, in particular, reservg. this for pol. decision
		at the time.  Others taking similar view on lesser sanctions.  We
		are no longer alone:  but U.S. still think we have brought this
		feeling about.

S.Ll.	Why can’t U.S. see tht. measures v. D.D.R. alone wd. be preferable,
		at the earlier stages?

H.	They still insist tht. all measures shd. be taken v. whole bloc.
		Our repve in N.A. Council was asked y’day to circulate his
		arguments for action v. D.D.R. &amp; on this too we may bring
		European Allies round to our view.

I.M.	We are thinking of what will bite:  they are thinking of a gesture.
		V. different tests.

H.	Real danger here is, not tht. we will get committed, but tht. U.S. will
		conclude we are faint-hearted over the whole affair.
	Shd we therefore try for a resolution in N.A. Council wh. will go some
		way to satisfy U.S. while reserving decision for Govts.

P.M.	Ty. &amp; B/T. to advise F.O. which of these measures are tolerable, if
		required as gestures.  M/T. to send F.O. a note on shipping.

			Agreed.

	And use to U.S. D.E.’s argument tht. it wd. force neutrals to depart
		from neutrality &amp; choose wtr. they are to trade or not.  They
		will mostly choose to continue to trade.

	F.O. shd. also consider what guidance to give on cultural etc. contacts
		with R. – in the light of latest test explosions.

			Agreed.

                  (d)	Negotiations.
H.	U.S./U.K. agreed there shd. be negotiations &amp; also on substance of 
		our aims in such negotns.
	Thompson probe – hampered because Fr. won’t be associated with it.
		[Negotiation leading to concession is worse than none.  Wait
		  until D.D.R. begin to interfere &amp; then negotiate in hot blood.
		  This is Fr. attitude.  We don’t share it, but can’t move them.]
		Therefore, if Thompson seeks search for basis, he must do so on
		behalf of U.K./U.S. alone.  Diff. in these circs. to see how we 
		shall get negotn on substance going.
	Ingredients of a settlement  i) Niesser/Oder line ii) acceptce  of
		D.D.R.  iii) No manuf. of nucl. weapons by Germany.  iv) Some		U.N. presence in Berlin.  In return K. wd. guarantee access &amp;
		embody that in a Treaty deposited with U.N.
	But latest speeches by K. &amp; Grom. are not encouraging.
	Time-table.  New G. Govt.  New Chancellor to go to W’ton &amp; be told
		what he must accept.  Then pressure on France to accept that.

S.Ll.	K. will want also i) admn tht. W. Berlin isn’t part of W. Germany &amp;
		prs ii) some assurance on espionage &amp; propaganda from 
		W. Berlin.

H.	But time is running out – for pol. deadlock in Bonn and intransigence
		in Paris.

Hail.	Fr. will blame us for any concession made.  Shd we lose therefore by
		going on w’out them.

H.W.	We have broken Fr. intransigence before by demonstrating in N.A.T.O.
		tht. they are in minority of one.

K.	Thompson mght. get further if we cd. stop U.S. playing tin soldiers
		in Berlin (Kutznetzar).

H.	German Amb. W’ton has put fwd. formula which amounts to
		de facto recognition of D.D.R.  This wd. be crucial to K.  Sole
		encouraging sign.
	Gromyko is showing interest in wider issues – Eur. security.
		This is v. frightening to Fr. &amp; G. - &amp; on account of their 
		anxieties we have reverted to a narrow agenda (Berlin only).
	Time-table.  K. may want to see a new G. President.

P.M.	What are long-term interests of U.K.?  M’tenance of N.A.T.O. – viz.
		European Alliance with U.S. involvement.  K.’s objective is to
		divide that:  Hence de G.’s posn:  any concession must weaken
		attachment of G. to W. Europe:  may even reveal to W. Germans
		the failure of their basic hope for unity, for A. has built himself
		on this – cling to U.S. &amp; G. will be re-united.  de G:  if this must
		happen, I will not be party to it:  let odium fall elsewhere, 
		&amp; preferably on (non-European) Anglo-Saxons.  [We want to 
		get in to Europe.]  Better, if concessions have to be made, to 
		make them when it really is plain tht. alternative is war.  My own
		belief is tht. at that stage we shd. be in weaker negotiating posn –
		near panic.
	We have gained respite because pol. deadlock in Bonn.  In 10 days or 
		so, we shall be under pressure here to negotiate:  our own opinion
		will press.
	Best solution:  G. themselves to take an initiative twds. concessions 
		which are inevitable.  Wd avert growth of myth tht. Anglo-
		Saxons sold them.
	Next:  Western initiative in agreement (our present plan).
	Next best:  U.S. initiative.  Less involved with Europe.  Also stronger.
		They ought to do so.  The have nil. to lose.
	Anglo-U.S. initiative.  Dangerous.  Will clinch myth tht. Anglo-Saxons
		are trying to destroy power of Europe.  From that pt. of view Br.
		initiative mght. be safer.
	Failing all of these French policy will prevail by efflux of time.

H.	M’while K. is increasing pressure on Finland &amp; moving troops twds.
		Iran.

	3.	Nuclear Tests.		[Enter  E.P.

	i)    Effect of Russian Tests.
Ch.H.	Asked to consider re-assurance to public on fall-out from recent
		R. tests.
		i)	Statements made already by Ministers etc., have steadied
				opinion.  Public is reasonably re-assured.  Mistake to
				do more at present.
		ii)	Need, unobtrusively, to put over a simpler statement of 
				hazards &amp; measures.  Draft prepared – 600 words. 
				(Larger bomb at great height may be less dangerous
				than small one lower.)
				Prs. this cd. be released (written Answer) by
				L. President.  Wd then be followed up, unobtrusively,
				by informn agencies.

Hail.	Support this.
	Had hoped all statements wd. be made by scientists – to ensure we
		were seen to be objective.  But they won’t make simple 
		statements – as only politicians can take responsibility for
		discretion.  Think now I shd. make statement – in H/L. in next
		few days.
J.M.	Hope this won’t be delayed.  Confusion in Scotland – especially over
		figures which are averaged.

P.M.	Consider wtr. particular Regions shd. have dried milk.
Ch.H.	If figure rises to danger point in particular area it will be issued in 
		that area.  Unlikely tht. situation will be reached.

J.M.	In subsequent announcements (factual) do utmost to avoid confusion
		over “running averages”.

	ii)	Resumption of U.K. Tests.
P.M.	Need to test war-head for Skybolt – improved Br. design.
	Want to make this test in U.S. series of underground tests.
	Need not announce at present.  Can be justified as necessary to 
		make weapon more effective &amp; safer.
						[Exit  E.P.
	4.	Ghana.  Queen’s Visit.

P.M.	Heavy burden of responsibility on Govt.
	All precautions taken.  D.S personal enquiries.  Assessment by
		Security Services.  Joint report:  no great likelihood of incident.
	Greatest risk:  drives thro’ country in remote places.  

CLOSED UNDER THE
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT 2000
D.S.	All our approaches have produced same re-action.

Hail.	Wd it help if U.K. Minister were in attendance?

P.M.	No-one went to India &amp; Pakistan.  We don’t distinguish betwn. 
		republican and monarchical parts of C’wealth.

D.S.	Shd be sorry to establish this precedent.

Hail.	Wd be some re-assurance to opinion here.

D.S.	Doesn’t out-weigh political disadvantages.

P.M.           x/	Might take a more senior staff – e.g. Scarboro’.  I will consider.

			Approved.   Formal submission.   P.M. to consider x/.

D.S.	White Paper – on strike at Tacoradi: relations with U.K:  may 
		be pretext for w’drawal.

I.M.	Disastrous reflection on Queen, if it occurred.

S.Ll.	N. was frank in disclosing republican intentions before Queen’s
		first visit.

H.	Criticism of H. Commr. office wd. be more serious.

P.M.	Mght. remind N. of his earlier disclosure of republican intentions.
		Heard rumours of w’drawal.  Can I have your re-assurance
		on this.  Any immediate intention of any constitutional change?
	5.	Commercial Policy:  Japan.

F.E.	Memo. submd with endorsement of E.P. Cttee.

P.T.	Memo meets all points raised in E.P.C.

			Memo. approved.
