  <content>C.C. 63 (61)					16th November, 1961

	1.	Parliament.		[Enter M.R.

I.M.	Business for next week.

R.A.B.	Commonwealth Immigrants.  Labour pressure will not be sustained for they know that public opinion is not with them.  On the Irish aspect, I can quote Brookeboro’.  It is impossible to control the border.  I have obtained assurance tht. Eire will raise comparable points to our own.

M.R.	Uneasiness in H/C.  Desire tht. there shd. be some supervision of Irish Labour e.g. by requirement to show insurance card &amp; prove he is in work.

R.A.B.	This comes fr. N.I.  But i) it wd. require legn here  ii) we cdn’t deport a man because he has no work.

Hail.	But it can be brought out tht. new power of deportn in Bill will be applied to Irish.

D.S.	We have not had proper C’wealth consultn on this.  No time was allowed.
It was read into R.A.B.’s speech at Brighton tht. final decisions had bn. taken.  Some C’wealth Govts. are v. sore about it.  Don’t let us pretend we consulted them properly.

P.M.	We delayed for 4 years because we disliked it.

	2.	Congo.

H.	Growing chaos.  Adoula fears his Govt. may break up.  Kisenga is drifting away:  T. has not bn. brght. to confer.  Needs strong resoln.
	In N.Yk Ceylon/Liberia resoln condemning Katanga &amp; ordering Sec. Genl. to deport mercenaries.  U.S. agree this is unacceptable.  Producg. resoln not much better qua encouraging U.N. forces to further action.
We are trying to moderate that in dirn of U.N. conciliation.
Alternatively, we cd. urge that course in speech &amp; abstain on vote.
Adoula wd think this lets him down.
Another line wd. be to urge no resoln until Sec. Genl. has had time to consider &amp; recommend.
	Wd be v. strong Party feeling if we supported resoln urging stronger U.N. action.
	Best course is to improve U.S. resoln and vote for it.
	Fear the Congo will be chaotic for years to come.

Hail.	Cd Adoula be persuaded to attack Kisenga:  &amp; so put himself in better position to draw closer to Tshombe.

	3.	Nuclear Tests.

P.M.	Circulated draft message to M.K.
This commits us to i) small secret recce  ii) mtg. of experts to define what is nature &amp; purpose of tests, so that President and I cd. take a political judgement.
	Have tried to introduce ques. of world opinion &amp; U.S./U.K. moral position.
	Supplementary message to Ambassador re meaning of reference to formal agreement.  Finance, command, information.  To avoid trouble we had had over Polaris.

H.W.	Agree we shd. smoke out what they intend.

D.S.	Support.

R.A.B.	Shd we hint tht. we might look elsewhere?  Marshalls.

P.M.	They wd. need either to get into Trust trouble with U.N. or to incur vast expense in doing it wholly at sea.
	Believe Mr.K. is under gt. pol. pressure:  doesn’t himself want to test:  courageously said not for pol. or propaganda reasons:  but added, to reduce pressure, will make prepns in case we are compelled to do so.
Then finds he can’t prepare w’in own jurisdiction.

I.M.	Pressure of world opinion over a period of months – wd. be intolerable.

P.M.	We shd. have to stand on Mr.K.’s final sentence.

P.T.	Will be diff. to satisfy public opinion why particular test falls w’in the definition.

P.M.	Not if it’s true tht. it always leaks in U.S. tech. press.

			Message approved.

	4.	Kenya.

	Note not taken.

	5.	Malaya.  Greater Malaysia.		[Exit R.A.B.
D.S.	Understanding reached btwn. Malaya &amp; Singapore, but it’s dependent on incln of Borneo territories.
	Problems	a) to secure continued use of our base in Singapore for
S.E.A.T.O purposes
			b) to secure consent of Borneo peoples to a merger
	We shall see more clearly when we have heard Tunku’s plans.

H.W.	Agree:  no concessions from us until we know what they propose.
Singapore is of no value unless we can use it.
Don’t mention Labnan – it’s not an alternative to Singapore.

D.S.	Presentation for Tunku:  for S.E.A.T.O. is really protection for Malaya tho’ he has separated the two.
	He wd. like S. to be termed a C’wealth base – no harm in that.

	6.	Airport Strike.

P.T.	Claim is for 21/2 p.hour:  total cost only £100 a wk.  B.O.A.C. men are getting it.  Device of up-grading some of the staff.  May bring them back.
