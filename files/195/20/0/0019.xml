  <content>C.C. 68(61).					7th December, 1961.

	l.	Parliament.	[Enter  Renton, M.R.

I.M.	Business for next week.
	C’wealth Immigration.  Shall need guillotine:  motion on final 
		Tuesday – to be announced next Thursday.  One more day
		(Tues. next) on Bill before the motion.  Will give time for H/C.
		to settle down, over Xmas, on this ques.
	Xmas Recess:  21st Dec. to 23rd Jan. (Tues.) to be announced to-day.
	Before Xmas two genl. debates – one on f. affairs (mainly Congo)
		and one on genl. economic policy (pay-pause etc.).

	2.	
CLOSED UNDER THE
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT 2000


	3.	Firemen’s Wages.	[Enter  R.W., P.M.G.

P.M.	Alternative drafts prepared.

S.Ll.	Favour 1st Jan. – in order to help with resistance of other claims. 
		Prefer alternative III.

P.M.	R.A.B. ready to leave it to Cab. but, if Jan. 1. is to be the date, he wd.
		prefer alternative II.

			Discussion – agreed we can’t support date of 8/12.

	On choice of 1962 dates – no argument for ½: (J.H.)

I.M.	I see advantage in ½.  Press are watching this:  we have a weapon
		here (grant):  we must use it:  will seem silly to use it for mere
		difference betwn. 8/12 and 1/1.

P.M.	Public won’t have date of 8/12.  If Council can’t settle for that, will
		they disclose it.

H.W.	Argument for 1/1 is tht. pre-pause element is here &amp; we have a 
		precedent in W. Council decisions.

E.M.	This increase is 20/.  Bad effect on rlway claim.

D.E.	Genl. grant argument quickly becomes political issue – as shown by
		attempt to prevent l.a.’s from hiring people for school meals.

H.B.	Unavoidable.  If we don’t use genl. grant, employers will go back
		to 31/10.

S.Ll.	On precedents only 2 dates – 1st Jan. or 2nd April.

		Agreed	1)   Alternative III, as amended, to be handed to 
				             leader of l.a. repves on Joint Council.

				2)   If Council settle on earlier date, this to be publd.
				              If they settle on 1/1., effect of 1st para. to be
				              made known in guidance to Press.  If no
				              decision, no Govt. announcement.
						[Exit  Renton.
	4.	Wages Policy.

S.Ll.	Agreed generally tht. statement of genl. policy shd. be made &amp; soon.
                 ii)	We cd. indicate amount available from increased production for
		increases of incomes – not more than £500 m. and much already
		predicated.  Therefore, next year must be one of moderate pause.
		Figure wd. be about 3%.
                  i)	This wd. be alternative to guiding light method:  as in offl. report.
                  iii)  Just stick to the pause.  But don’t believe that wd. be practicable.
	Timing:  must have early talks with 2 sides of industry.  Shd be
		initiated before Xmas.  Let them reject guiding light, if it has to
		be rejected.  If we can’t get agreed wages policy with industry,
		say we mean to work twds. it – m’while my view of economy
		is……………

F.E.	Accept need for early statement.
		Guiding light – irrelevant to employers:  employed in negotn.
		My preference:  reject “policy” on wages:  promise to disinflate
		so tht. employers can’t increase wages.  Restrain demand:  
		increase competn by lowering tariffs.  A few paras. on those lines.

M.	Real problem:  annual round of wage increases.
		Opposed to g. light.  It wd. become minimum – even for rate.
	Merit in S. Ll.’s (ii) – figures showing what we can &amp; can’t afford.
	Beeching y’day told us S.Ll. shd. say still need for restraint &amp; we
                   y/		must concentrate mainly on cases of injustice.
	Statement of 25/7 foreshadowed statement early in N. Year reportg.
		results of production.

I.M.	Employers outbidding competitors for labour – earnings therefore
		exceed rate.
	G. light wd. become minimum.  Every award above it wd. be a 
		political defeat.
	Policy related to y/ wd. be much easier to defend.

Hail.	Criticisms of draft W. Paper are conclusive.
	But pause policy won’t last much longer.
	Planning may be eventual answer.  What we want now is interim
		statement to bridge that interval.
		Hope he will say 2½% is as much as we can afford.  Sanction.
		Cdn’t taxation be threatened in reln to wages as well as profits?
		Why not?  Must have some teeth in a statement.

H.W.	No wage restraint is practicable unless accepted as fair.
	Shd. Govt. not concentrate on stable prices - &amp; then argue for no
		wage increases.
	Set up planning body &amp; put genl. figures to it.
	Must be scope to deal with injustice.
	Can’t abandon comparability.
	Prefer to say:  main Govt contn is stability in c/living.
D.E.	Turning point in econ. policy.  Monetary &amp; fiscal measures are not
		enough to control wages.  In 1960 we secured steady prices 
		but largest rise in incomes!
	Must find wages policy.  S.Ll. says can’t be based on sanctions &amp;
		controls.  Must therefore be a guide.  No chance of controlling
		wages if Budg. &amp; fiscal measures going in other directions.
		If we rely on public support, can’t do another surtax operation.
		If you have a guiding light &amp; it’s ignored there’s obvious case
		for financial methods of protecting £.
	Insistent demand for answers to ques. – when is pause to end, what 
		will policy be.
	Favour early statement i) April 2:  end of Pause  ii) policy for 
		remainder of 1962.  iii) invite industry to discuss longer-term
		policy after end 1962.
	“Minimum will be exceeded.”  Say tht. anything higher shd. be 
                    x/		related to period longer than 1 Year.
	G. light for not more than 1 yr. at a time.

I.M.	What sanction behind x/.?

J.H.	Thghts. on offl. report are only basis for this in democratic system.
	M’while, what holding operation?
	Sure tht. g. light wd. be minimum.
	Attracted by S.Ll.’s (ii).  But agree with Hail. there must be teeth:
		Must indicate alternative – use of fiscal measures, even tho’
		this does temporarily check growth.
	Timing.  Can’t wait until January.  Announcemt. before Xmas.
		But shd. not include i) in D.E.’s remarks.
	Immedte consultns with industry – next week.

E.M.	G. light is wrong because affects only basic rate.  Earnings are what
		matter.  Carpenters on H’smith earned 75% more than
		roster.  They get scarcity wages.
	We must therefore tolerate inflation or get more unemployment.
	Only where there is unemploymt. (e.g. labourers at Helburn) do
		earnings correspond to rate.
	Support S.Ll.’s (ii).  Statement before Xmas. essential to hold posn.
	Can’t get rid of comparability.  W’out it, can’t operate e.g. rlways.
		because man-power will move out.
	Pause has created injustices.  First need is to put those right.

		Why not consult T.U.C. privately on that.  E.g. motormen:
		take-home pay only £15.10.0 incldg. overtime – as cpd. with
		over £20 for e.g. steel-fixers.

K.	Distinguish between short-term policy &amp; long.  Pause temporary
		expedient.  Promise given to proceed to policy of growth.  On
		that must have consultn with 2 sides of industry.  Talk of
		machinery for that:  but lack so far is knowledge of what it is 
		to do.  Must have a policy – and a statement of it.
	Impressed by offl.’s draft.  May be derided as exhortn.  But unless
		this guidance is heeded, we shd. have to invoke fiscal sanctions.
	Must have statement soon if we are to get opinion behind us.
		How indicate what you want unless you give some guidance.

P.M.G.	Must try to make g. light work.  Early talks with industry.
		Presentn.	i)  must assure T.U.’s on stable prices.
				ii) must enlist support of p. opinion.

J.M.	Sympathy with E.M. on over-full emplt.  Need for selective fiscal
		measures to shield areas where unemplt. is high.
	Cdn’t we time announcemt. on this to co-incide with that of H.B.’s
		economy measures.

Ch.H.	Holding statement before Xmas.  Offl. report contains much to
		encourage restraint.  Diffies derive mainly fr. stating things in
		%age terms.  Better therefore to go for S.Ll.’s (ii):  but adding
		warning of determn to use fiscal measures to correct excesses.
	Don’t despise exhortation.  Can’t be avoided in free society.

S.Ll.	Can’t say anythg. of substance before Xmas because can’t do that 
		w’out consultn with T.U.’s.

	5.	Railway Wages.

E.M.	B.T.C. waiting for Unions to ask for a date for mtg. to hear B.T.C.
		reply.  They are not hurrying.  A.S.L.E.F. are not mtg. until
		after Xmas.
	Unions are seeking 10%.  Beeching says 10-11% on Guilleband.
		But 6% wd. be reasonable.  And, but for pause, he wd. offer
		6% from ¼.  Arbitn wd. cost more.
	No need therefore for Govt. decision to-day.		[Exit  E.H.

	4.	Wages Policy (resumed).

C.S.	S.Ll.’s (ii) is better presentn.  But has no more chance of success.
		If it can’t succeed, we must disinflate – to get unemplt.  This
		is turning point.  In Europe they have got across the idea tht. 

		excessive wage increases are not in natl interest.  We must get
		it understood here that alternative to self-discipline = 
		unemployment.

R.W.	Agree with C.S. on Europe:  brght. out in offl. report.
	We must do more to bring it home.  Method (ii).

D.E.	What disinflationary measures?

F.E.	Tight rein on home demand.

S.Ll.	If wages rise, c/living will rise:  what measures do you use then?

P.M.	How square this circle.  Over-full emplt:  v. high c/living:  currency
		dependent on oversea trade.
	First:		get new planning organn going.  Won’t bring that off if you
			give impn tht. wage restraint is its main purpose.
I wd. start at other end.  Put its function as increasg. size of the cake.  Stress creative &amp; constructive function.
	Second:	Distribn of the cake.  Let that grow out of first.
			Time isn’t quite ripe for a g. light.
	Third:	On E.M.’s figures a lesson for us.  Dpts. are always trying
			to add to demand for scarce labour.  We ought to be reducg.
			it, esp. in areas where there are shortages.  This = result of
			our own policies.
	Fourth:	Can’t cure this by disinfln, even if we cd. disinflate.
			Must go for growth.  Must create p. opinion v. excessive
			money rewards regardless of economic cost.  Sweden has
			done this.
	Fifth:		All Govts. must do some stop &amp; go.  Budget is governor
			of economy.  Must use it.  B. surplus is disinflating weapon.	Sixth.	No firm end of pause.  Shade off.
					    [Exit  R.W., P.M.G.

	6.	Congo.

H.	Irish, Malays, Swedes in real danger in K.  Only way in which they
		can be helped, is by air operations – to keep communications
		open.  Can we give them limited no. of bombs – use restricted
		to opns to safeguard lives of U.N. troops.
