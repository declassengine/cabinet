  <content>C.C. 26 (62)					5th April, 1962

	1.	Parliament.		[Enter Mr.R.

I.M.	Business.  Budget next week throughout.
	Monday following:  Supply.  Opposition may want Rhodesia.  Will discuss with them.

	2.	Foreign Affairs.

H.	a) Berlin.	No R. interference or flights in air corridors, since Friday.

H.W.	Norstadt thinks R. are trying to get out of this.

	b) Congo.	A &amp; T. are talking:  no progress.
	c) Indonesia.  Mr K. has pressed Sukarno to resume talks.  He seemed ready to do so, on phased in &amp; out plan in concert with U.N.  But Lunz has re-acted against resumption: &amp; is cross with U.S.  Local pressures in Holland wd. be useful if plan were leaked, but we daren’t do that.

	3.	Rhodesia.

R.A.B.	Memo. based on discussions with Govrs. &amp; H. Commr., who all agreed.
Want soundings now – otherwise we can’t hold Banda from coming here.  Must deal with N. ques.:  pity to handle it alone – esp. while Fedn is having its election.  Hence composite approach.
Start talks with Banda in confidence &amp; tell Fed. Govt. we’re doing so.
	Banda won’t have existg Fedn but is not adamant v. some other form of assocn.  If we accept his statement tht. he is now willing to remain in present Fedn, we may get constructive help from him
	Welensky won’t be constructive, but might acquiesce in initiative by us.  Hence plan for small constitutional mission – not as successor to Monckton or to be repve:  but to do the work.  Annex shows what is needed.  (i) wd. be done by Dep. Chairman.  (ii) is bait for S. Rhodesia &amp; Fedn.  4 men:  to help our chaps on the spot &amp; ourselves.  (iv)  Cd. be left over pro-tem.

D.S.	Wd report be published?

R.A.B.	No.

D.S.	If it were published, factories wd. take as minimum parts which suited them.
	Does (iii) not simply that we have decided already to break up Fedn?

R.A.B.	Merge (iii) into (ii) – to examine, with the Govts. concerned including the Federal Govt.
	There wd. have to be some statement.

K.	Para 3 of memo.  “to get things moving”.  Avoid implying a re-hash of Monckton.  Stress that it’s a working body.  Special advisers vice formal commission.

E.H.	Factual material cd. usefully be published.

R.A.B.	For consideration.

H	Support idea of advisers.
	Nyasaland:  tell Banda we won’t meet his deficit if he abandons advantages of Federation.
	Worried about 2(c):  does it involve referendum?

R.A.B.	Tied by preamble of Fed. Constitution.
	N. Rhodesia delay – gives us chance to make progress with different form of association.  Between now &amp; October.

D.E.	Success depends on the peoples’ understanding economic facts.
Commn shd. include someone like Tuke, who wd. carry more influence with employers than an economist.

Hail.	T. of r. speak wholly of Govts.  Advisers shd. not be so restricted.

R.A.B.	Accept that point.

P.M.	Summing up.  i) Avoid impression of another R. Commn.
		A working body – instrument for R.A.B. to help him.
No single formal Report:  stream of advice
		Factual material cd. be made public at will.

R.A.B.	Alport has now advised me to put more stress on economic aspects.

P.T.	Cd the Commrs. be attached to R.A.B.’s staff – to keep final decision in our hands.  Special advisers.

P.M.	We must avoid position that Parlt. has a right to see &amp; discuss what they say.

S.Ll.	Do we need more staff or strength on the economic side?
		Either in W’hall or on Commrs. – or both.

R.A.B.	Stress penultimate sentence of memo.
	Also para 7.  Govr. believe Banda can be persuaded to accept this.

M.	Frederick Seaborg (?) – Barclays:  is v. knowledgeable on Fedn.

			Agreed:  On amended basis – Govr. to open proposals with
	          with Banda &amp; H. Commr. with Welensky.

	4.	Kenya.

R.M.	Parties agree to framework for constitution.
	On formn of Coalition – K.A.D.U. agreeable.  K.A.N.U. have asked for i) Kenyatta is to be head of Govt.  ii) date of independence.
		I have told them I can agree to neither;  but have given them formula on (ii) which they may accept.
	If there is a break now, it will be responsibility of K.A.N.U.
	Economic missions project have bn. accepted.

	5.	Zanzibar.

R.M.	Parties can’t agree:  no constitutional advance possible.  Told Delegations to go home.

	6.	National Theatre.

H.B.	Going well.  Next step will be to publish (Joint Council) so that we can submit it formally to Art Council.  They are our official advisers.  We can’t be committed until we have their advice.

P.T.	Why another opera house?

H.B.	Because Sadlers’ Wells isn’t suitable for opera.
	Stratford cdn’t have bn kept in:  jealousies too great.

P.M.	Bring it out before Easter.
			Agreed.

	7.	Nuclear Tests.

P.M.	Clear from Geneva that R. are not prepd to accept any checks in their territory.
	Much talk on wtr. underground tests cd. be detected from outside R.
		B. scientists are more hopeful on this than U.S., &amp; both agree tht. such a system wd. not be wholly reliable at present.  But not the immediate problem for, even with this system, you wd. need some means of investigating the doubtful events:  and R. will have none of that.  Argument on means of establishing prima facie case is therefore irrelevant at present.
		U.S. have now given preliminary notices to mariners &amp; tests will start soon after Easter.
	Must therefore have joint appeal to K. or joint statement.
Mr.K. has no objn to my making independent appeal.  W’ton tel. message of ¾.  Or he wd. agree to a joint statement.
Shall I concentrate on joint statement e.g. Thursday – or shd. I make, in advance (tomorrow) an independent approach (by letter) to K.?  If K.’s reply were negative, we cd. still have joint statement.  Read draft of such a letter.  Recognise reply wd. be negative (some loss of prestige):  might be thought we were not fully in line with Mr.K. tho’ this presumption cd. be dispelled:  might make it more difficult to get Summit on even more crucial matter of Berlin.  Br. opinion – two views:  some wd. be glad we had done everything:  others that it’s pointless.

D.S.	Favour a letter.  But wd. explain more fully what we have proposed, can’t understand why it isn’t acceptable.  Rejection wdn’t damage our prestige.  Mr.K. seems to want it.

H.	There must be joint statement next week.  That wd. make D.S. points in full.
	If P.M. writes, K. may send reply embarrassing to U.S. – who are now determined to test.  He may say:  I offered Summit mtg. on this.

H.W.	U.S. scientists are divided.  Mr.K. mght. be in diffy if K. accepted internatl detection.  Even so, favour letter.

I.M.	Favour letter – to show we have done all we can.

S.Ll.         x|	Shd you put the dangers to Mr.K..

Hail.	Favour appeal – but it isn’t convincing if it’s all about underground tests when only practical issue now is tests in atmosphere.

P.M.	Ready to put these Mr.K. viz. offer of Summit or acceptance of principle when we mght. be divided on methods &amp; numbers.

K.	Favour letter.

P.T.	So do I.

C.S.	For home opinion, yes.  But support S.Ll.’s point because U.S./U.K. relations.

J.H.	Favour letter – but not in terms of an appeal.

D.E.	Only reason why K. shd. respond to desire to split us from Americans.

E.H.	R. determined to test.  U.S. are right to test now.
Offer to suspend atm. tests w’out inspn was a mistake.
	Our relns with U.S. &amp; with other W. Powers.  Latter will be taken as dividing ourselves fr. U.S. – with no prospect of success.
Will weaken our posn.
	I wd. prefer to rely on joint statement.

R.A.B.	Impressed by E.H.’s points.

H.	All internatl arguments are v. letter.  No point in it unless needed for U.K. opinion.

R.M.	Not needed for U.K. opinion.

H.B.	We shd. not do this solely for sake of U.K. opinion.
Letter shd. make it plain tht. rejection wd. not be of U.K. alone but of all countries of the world.

P.M.	Put it to Mr.K. – does he still think it wd. be worth doing.
