  <content>C.C. 69(61).					7th December, 1961.
					(10.15 p.m.)
	Congo.

	(a)	Bombs.

H.	Uncertain whether India have any.  They expect us to give them:
		Indian troops at risk.  Propose to supply:  on condition used 
		only for protection of U.N. troops in danger and raking out
		a runway used for attack on them.

K.	C.R.O. support.  Indian feeling is very strong.  G.B. no reason to
		believe Indians have any bombs.

H.W.	Believe they have.  But don’t dissent from H.’s view.

H.	Will get specific assurance from Bunche re use of bombs.

	(b)	Policy in Katanga.

H.	U Thant says this is only local action to protect U.N. troops and keep
		communications open.  More difficult than they think.  But U.T.
		pledged to P.D. that it won’t develop into attack on K. as such
		and that he wishes T. remain P.M. there because sees no-one
		else who could do it.
	His object:  re-integrate Congo by conciliation.
	He won’t seek out mercenaries in hiding.
	If this action is so limited, we could not fail to assist it:  can’t allow
		U.N. troops to be massacred and must keep l/c. open.
	Spaak thought we should do more to get A. and T. together.  Their
		statements over months show very little difference between 
		them.  Both favour confederal solution:  each ready for pooling
		of money.  K. willing contribute.  S. suggests we and U.S. go to
		A. and invite him negotiate for a solution on this basis.  Worth
		trying.  Will suggest to Rusk in Paris.

P.M.	(1)  On content little between them.  (2)  But they may dislike one 
		another.  If so they won’t agree.  (3)  Location of meeting.
		U.S. as paymasters could force A. to negotiate.

R.A.B.	Bombs – seems inevitable.  But must not go contrary to L.P.S.
		statement that we won’t support U.N. in co-ercing Katanga.

Ch.H.	As soon as news leaks re bombs, we must be able to publish
		assurances given by U.N.

P.M.	U.N. are beginning to see problems of Colonialism.

S.Ll.	Will support if H. think it right, but goes against the grain.

P.M.	F.O. and M/D. to work out number and character of
		bombs and assurances required as to their use.

	Policy - resumed.

H.	Renewed efforts to get A. and T. together, perhaps with a third person.
		Possibly courier as go between until they are close enough to
		warrant meeting (e.g. with Bunche) to clinch it.

L.	A.’s pride could surely be over-ruled if U.N. people on spot were 
		tough enough with him.  Fear U.N. officials may be even 
		encouraging him.

H.	U.S. might give them a push.
