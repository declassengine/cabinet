  <content>C.C. 25 (62)					30th March, 1962

	1.	Common Market:  Commonwealth Consultation.	[Enter M.R.

P.M.	Am informing C.P.M. tht. we want a mtg.  Picture will have emerged by end July.  C.P.M. to start 10/9.
	We shall have a bad summer.  Must consider later how to get some holiday early in August.

	2.	West Irain.

H.	Informal contacts betwn. D. &amp; Indonesians – were going well:  basis D. adminn wd. phase out as I. phased in.  But Sokarno broke off talks because D. didn’t accept immediate recognition.  He then sent invaders to off-shore islands.  D. are sending re-inforcemts. to throw them out:  &amp; we shall be asked for re-fuelling facilities – and later, perhaps, logistic support more generally.
U.S. may feel tht., if serious fighting developed, they have to give such support.

Hail.	U.S. cd, do it at sea:  much easier, politically.

H.	Can prob. fend this off pro-tem.  Tell Amb. to try U.S. – easier.

P.M.	Cd be v. awkward situation for us. 

	3.	Laos.

H.	Harriman has persuaded Thais to support U.S. view – neutral Laos under nald govt. under Phonma.  They are advising Phonmi accordingly.
But latter holds out still.  And we are stuck.  King has proved broken reed in this.
	Communists think Phonmi will collapse in 2 months if U.S. help w’drawn.
	R. Amb. seems to be co-operative:  pressures on Phonmi.  But dangerous to w’draw support in case Communists shd. get upper hand:  which they cd. do if R. eluated.  But seems no other way of bringing him to heel.

P.M.	This is policy we persuaded U.S. to follow.  But, if it lets Communists in, great blow to U.K. – and to the West generally.

H.	Neutral Govt. under Phonma is best solution – with armies disbanded and internatl supervision.  But Phonmi can’t be bought.

	4.	Congo.

H.	T/A. talks continuing, but not going well.  T. will wait.  But U.N. man (Gardiner) is losing patience, and suggests best way is to clear up Katanga by force – using Army of Central Govt.  This seems to conflict with U. Thants policy on use of force.  We must counsel patience.

	5.	Berlin.

H.	U.S. had 40 hrs. of talk at all levels – we are all reading the records now!
	Calm &amp; objective discussion of the problem – after initial propaganda.
	E. Germans have put up some arbitration proposal for air corridors – a 4 Power court to settle dispute.  This suits them	[Exit Ch.H.
		because implies recognition.  U.S. are considering wtr. they can “distort” it.

	6.	Nuclear Tests.

H.	U.S. have made up mind to test.  Had hoped they wd. separate atmosph. from underground; for former can be detected – and inspected by air samples collected by neutral aircraft.  But now clear Mr.K. wd. not accept this – i.e. ban on tests in atmosphere.
	U.S. Govt. much concerned at Congress attitude.
	One other plan we cd. put to U.S.  “International minus one” posts round Soviet Union vice internatl posts w’in S. Union.  Wd mean more inspn teams going in to check doubtful incidents, wh. R. are certain to reject.  Just worth trying to get Mr.K. to offer this.

I.M.	Public opinion accepts tht. we have done all we can:  blame lies with R.:  expect U.S. to make the test series.  V. steady.

P.M.	i)	Wd still like to avoid tests.
ii)	Want to get best public position, if tests are inevitable.
	Feeling (H.G.) tht. we ought to be talking to K.?		[Exit K.
Tho’ I wd. prefer to reserve that for Berlin.

I.M.	Public like Summits, but want them to be meaningful.

H.	U.S. want Summit on Berlin, if there is any hope of modus vivendi.  There is a chance of getting some agreement on disarmament which cd. be submitted for endorsement by Summit.
In that context it wd. have to be in May.

	7.	Kenya.

R.M.	Two points outstandg.  i) land: White Highlands
		                            ii) control of police.
		May get agreement on these.
	Kenyatta may decline to sign because no date for independence.
		He may also brk. on exclusion of Odinja.
	Wd prefer to see a break on either of latter than on former.
