  <content>C.C. 73 (61)			                                                    13th December, 1961 (4.15.pm)

	1.	Education.		[Enter M.R.

a)	Investment Expenditure.

H.B.	G.n.p. rising by 2%-3%.  Ty. seekg. agreement with Dpts. on limits of expansion of services.  My proposal for educn is 3%p.a.  cpd. with 21/2% agreed for N.H.S.
£694m. in current year.  at my rate £779m in 4 yrs’ time.  D.E. suggests £830m. by then viz. 4-6% p.a.  If we allow for educn an expansion so much greater than q.n.p. rate, we shall have to cut heavily into other services.
	D.E.’s suggen is related to investment p’mme as in para. 9 of my memo.
Ty. original plan:  stabilise at present level.  In July S.Ll. agreed to £120.5  i.e. increase of £3.3m p.a.  This involved p‘ponement of some projects l.a.’s were expectg. to start in 1962/3.
	Must fix a figure.  L.c.a’s need to know scale of p’mme.

D.E.	Tory success:  &amp; in acc. with Tory philosophy.  Welcomed by country.
Part of our image.  If we have to go into reverse, diffies because this is long-term p’mme with sound fwd. planning.  [Rising cost is due to teachers’ salaries:  hard to justify reducg. intake:  we already are unable to accept for training girls with A level certs.]  In 1st year 20% of expenditure to work done:  40% in 2nd:  3-% in 3rd:  10% in 4th.  Para. 5. of Annex:  justified items in break-down.  i) must be top priority  ii) pledged to complete in 5 yrs. &amp; shall do so except in L’pl.   iii) designed to give up to date labs. etc., to all secondary schools – essential to supply techn. colleges  iv) has the same purpose.  This leaves (v):  we said in W. Paper we wd. tackle this.  Cut of 1/3rd in July on minor works has made this posn worse.  What remains under (v) is mainly for secondary schools.
To get down to £120.5 I shd. have to exclude much of this.  I shd. have to control starting dates.  Not prepd to do this when it doesn’t apply to other bldg.  Bldg. in other public services is to rise by 15%:  why shd. education be reduced to 10%.  Wd. not square with policy of growth.

E.M.	I have to control starting dates, for roads.

Ch.H	There is also control in public housing.  And I have also had to push our projects previously authorised to start.

K.	Drew attention to para. 14 of C.210.  This means tht. things excluded from 1962/3 cd. be included in 3 later years.

H.B.	Yes:  can be done if D.E. will introduce control of starts.
And I wd. not insist on £120.5 in each year, so long as 4 years were within that x4.
	Ed. building has bn. v. large for some time.

J.M.	Can we contemplate deliberate slowing-down of recruitment of teachers?
	Further educn &amp; techn. colleges?  Shd we relax pressure for day-release?
If not, we must build to be ready.
	I can phase back my replacement p’mme.

R.A.B.	I wd. have thought that cd. be done in E. &amp; W. also. 

H.B.	There is in 5(i) some element of old schools also.

Hail.	If you delayed 6 schools how much wd. you save?

I.M.	In 1951 we gave housing deliberate priority.  We recently gave the same to education.  On that basis 4.6% is not a large increase.
	Shd we not look at public investment as a whole?

Ch.H.	Support that.  Housing has already bn. cut from 110.000 to 100.00 houses.  This isn’t enough for ’63.  Fear this may be pol. issue then.
If I am to have 120.000 in 1963 (slum clearance) I have to find means of cutting out other forms of bldg.

E.M.	Support that, too.  Can’t afford to accept any cuts in road p’mme.

R.A.B.   x|	1. Cab. to look at public investment as a whole.
                |	2. M’while D.E. shd. consider wtr. we cd. not p’pone some re-modelling projects.

D.E.	Qua investment, I wd. go for (v) – wh. saves nothing on current expenditure.

H.B.	D.E. is refusing to look at alternative p’mme.
He shd. take various levels between £120.5 &amp; his bid, work out what wd. be involved, &amp; show how each conflicts with pledges etc.

D.E.	We can try deflationary policies designed to produce enough unemplt. to retrain wage demands.  Or we can have a wages policy.  But will you get enough support for second if you press first?
			Agreed as at x/.
			E.P.C. memo. on Inv. P’mme to be circulated to Cabinet.
	
2.	Colleges of Advanced Technology.
D.E.	Six negotns have reached point where we cd. transfer by ¼ .
No saving in public expre is involved, only transfer from l.a. to Exch.
Am I, for sake of this, to report my relations with most powerful l.a.’s.

H.B.	We must redeem S.Ll.’s pledge of 21/2%.  Transfer in Apl. will put at least £5m. on Exchequer.  When shall we find that saving elsewhere?
This will be less painful than most.

Hail.	Saving Exch. at expense of rates is not genuine saving.

H.B.	We cd. have accepted this at original figures of £11/3m given by M/Ed.
Edn Policy Cttee approved it at that figure, with no date.
	Now it emerges as £5m, and as we are pledged to the 21/2%, surely we shd. take this painless course.  If we don’t, we shall find it v. much more difficult to find £5m. from somewhere else.

M.	Cdn’t M/E. ask l.a.’s to agree to delay.  If they won’t, we must stand behind him.

P.T.	At the end of exercise we wdn’t scruple over a “fiddle” to round off the 21/2%.
Don’t give this away now.

D.E.	Told Ty. in Oct. the cost and the date.

			P’pone decision – until we see where we are on total savings.
