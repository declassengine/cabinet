  <content>C.C. 61 (61)					9th November, 1960

	1.	Parliament.		[Enter M.R.

I.M.	Business for next week.  And, in following week.  20/21 Nov. 2nd Rdg. of Transport Bill.

	2.	Government Expenditure:  Administrative Savings.

H.B.	Dpts. have with Ty agreed to minor savings totalling about £143/4m.
Subject to minor adjustments these are agreed figures.
Seek Cab. endorsement.  Ministers to embody these in Estimates &amp; draw those as tightly as possible.
	Policy proposals – to follow later.
	Not suitable for announcement as a whole.  Some will need to be announced piecemeal:  will discuss timing with Ministers concerned and I.M.
	Society:  magnis successor is less amiable:  he leaked infn gained in Whitley negotiations.  Dpts. shd. be warned tht. Nunn is not reliable.

			Agreed:  N.B. to consider.

C.S.	I shall have to announce p’ponment of swim-fiver campaign.
            x?	Shall I relate it to genl. campaign to compress Govt. expenditure.

H.B.	Yes.

C.S.	Then timing will be important:  wd. want to go off with other things.

Hail.	Research Councils.  Savings are not minor in reln to their expenditure.
Effects on policy &amp; politics will be large.

H.	Para. 14 (2).  On oversea expenditure we have saved 5% already:  personnel cut abroad may have to be accommodated at home – and that will make it more difficult to economise in home expenditure.

			Agreed:  on reflection, better not to do x/.  Announce each as 
	          Dpl. affair.

	3.	O.E.C.D. Next Meeting.

S.L1.	Letter from Ball (U.S.) indicatg. next mtg. will be propaganda tht. Western world will increase G.N.P. by 50% in 10 years.  Actual over last 10 yrs. is not much above 3%.  Future realistic estimate around 4%.  Dangerous – targets not reached are represented as failure.  So far, I have forecast not more than 3% for U.K.
	Best course may be to choose longer period.

E.M.	Awkward for wages policy.
			No enthusiasm for high target.		[Enter D.S.

	4.	Nubian Monuments.

D.E.	£367m = cost of Dam.  R. not asked to pay anything for this damage, nor have they contributed to Unesco fund.
	Unesco have had only 39 replies:  see para 2.:  U.S. now likely to contribute only to “File”.  11 countries have declined – incldg. 4 C’wealth countries.
	$15m p.a. = income of Unesco.  This is our of scale with its proper work.
Also, any money available for Africa wd. be better spent on education.
	Only reason for this is politics.

Hail.	Will $72m be reached by due date?  What value will be gained by money likely to be raised?  What will they do?

D.E.	They can’t save Abu Simbel with money likely to be raised.  But lesser sum wd. be spent on other things.  And in Sudan we cd. prob. do more.

H.B.	How can we do this, when we are pressing for economics all round.
If we give £50.000 we shall be asked for more later.
Effect on Br. subjects damaged in Egypt?

H.	Only reason for doing this is to improve relns with U.A.R.

D.E.	If R. won’t contribute, why shd. we?

R.A.B.	Para. 6 (b).

			Agreed:  no enthusiasm, but p’pone decision.

	5.	Commonwealth Immigration.		[Enter P.M.

R.A.B.	Impracticable to control Irish border.  But we make statement proposed, Irish Republic will probably help to close their gap thro’ which W. Indians wd. pour.  Tho’ they wd. have to legislate.

D.S.	Asked for explanation in detail.

R.M.	Amend statement to make it plain tht. this is solely due to practical considerations.

I.M.	We can quote Chuter Ede, who had to make same defence of the Irish decision.

Ch. H.	More emphasis on practical considerations.

K.	This pass was sold in 1948.  Reflects facts of history &amp; geography.
British Isles are in fact a unit.

R.A.B.	We cd. try to get a bargain with Eire – on basis tht. we had asked them to take this action &amp; they had agreed – for announcement in 2nd Rdg. debate.
	We cd. also bring out seasonal labour more clearly.

			Agreed:  subject to drafting changes.

	6.	Kenya:  Kenyatta.

R.M.	Tribal tensions rising &amp; economy declining:  risk of serious clash.
Best bit:  conference early ’62 to devise safeguards for minorities.
All action m’while shd. make tht. more likely to succeed.
	K. is now free in all respects save eligibility for Parlt.  Govr. now want to remove this restn.  Tho’ leader of major Party he is old man &amp; in Parlt. may be shown up &amp; cut down to size.
	Fear of his being Ch. Minister.  We cdn’t prevent that when K. independent or even respons. for internal self-govt.
	On balance, believe this will be wiser course.

Hail.	Effect on opinion re C’wealth.  We were too good to associate with S. Africa.  What about this?  Will he be cut down to size?
Will he attend P.M.M. or advise Queen?  If so, where is C’wealth going?  V. disturbing.

H.	Similarly concerned.  Looking to conference &amp; beyond, won’t it be more difficult to persuade minorities to accept safeguards?  Who cd. have any confidence in safeguards applied by him?

R.M.	But he is the leader of his Party:  &amp; we can’t stop him being 1st Minister when country is independent.

D.S.	Can we escape this?  We are giving the country its independence.
Even with this disability he cd. become a Minister.
We can’t hold him back.  Surest way of bldg. him up is to continue to restrict him.

R.M.	The minority tribes think they can cut him down in Parlt., more easily than if he remains outside.

D.S.	Hope so:  but believe we must be ready for worse alternative of his becoming leader.
	Want time, however, to warn Welensky &amp; some other C’wealth leaders.

K.	Immedte risk of tribal war:  can’t be averted w’out conference:  and conference can’t succeed unless this restn on K. is removed.
	Only real hope for Europeans is assocn in E. African federation.
Chance of that will be prejudiced if we make K. a martyr.

I.M.	K.’s arrival in Ldn. has excited no notice.  He is not national leader in Kenya:  several areas which he can’t even enter.  Process of reducing him to tribal leader has already gone some way.
	I therefore support R.M.’s proposal.

Hail.	If there is no national leader, can we concede independence – w’out creating another Congo.  Mere association of tribes of which Europeans are one.

R.M.	Only 2 courses in K.:  rule it ourselves or find a constitution which safeguards minorities.

P.M.	Govr. previously said tht. if this disqualification were removed it wd. 
              x|		lead to w’drawal of many European officials.

R.M.	Impossible to hold country for any length of time under direct rule.

I.M.	Ch. Whip believes this will cause no political trouble her.
	Shd it be timed to appear result of his visit to Ldn?  Better Not?

R.M.	Equally inadvisable for it to appear to flow from my visit to Kenya.

H.	If  Kenyatta became Ch. Minister we cdn’t rely on him to m’tain safeguards for minorities.

R.M.	It is Kikiwu the others fear - &amp; he wd. lead them even if outside Parlt.

M.	Wait until R.M. has visited Kenya &amp; talked to people there.

R.M.	Govr. thinks x/ will still be bad but not so bad as he feared before.

H. &amp; Hail.	Ready to acquiesce in this decision:  but it will lead to our having to stay longer, &amp; keep troops longer in Kenya. 

R.A.B.	I agree.

P.M.	This discussion illustrates real difficulty – how are we to handle future of Kenya as a whole.  We are here up against our first Algeria problem. (as in Rhodesia).  I’m not hopeful tht. Blundell solution will work.  Possible, if we build safeguards into constitn on American model.  But, if we can’t, we may have to buy out our colonies.
	How far will amendment of this law affect this problem?

R.M.	Timing?
		Genl. feeling tht. it wd. be easier after R.M. had bn. in Kenya and talked to all parties there.

P.M.	Adjourn discussion until next week &amp; then widen it to include future of Kenya.  Oral forecast by R.M.

	7.	Germany:  Berlin.

H.	Formula proposed by U.S.  Still ambiguous:  but U.S. say they do understand our position and believe this draft to give effect to it.

Hail.	We are being asked once again to agree to a nonsense.


Ch. H.	Seek amendment of last sentence – e.g. omit “if in fact such blockage of access to W. Berlin has occurred.”

H.          x|	I have already told U.S. that we won’t agree to this except as last resort if war seems imminent.

P.M.	Dislike last sentence.  For we know it’s imposs. to impose total embargo.  This contemplates its continuance (and patent failure) for some months w’out a war.  The concludg. words are nonsense because, as it is ineffective, it can’t avoid war.
	If we accept, we shd. put on record in N.A.T.O. what we have said about our interpretn – i.e.  x/ above.

H.	Our postn lies in the middle sentence.  Given that, can’t we swallow the last sentence with the explication above?

I.M.	I support that view.

H.	I will try to secure omission of final sentence.  If I fail I will make clear on the record how we interpret it.

P.M.	Allow discussion to proceed in N.A.T.O. – warning U.S. about last sentence in particular:  as above  i.e. warning them tht. if it passes in this form our understandg. of its meang. as already given to them will have to be put on record for imformn of our other Allies.
