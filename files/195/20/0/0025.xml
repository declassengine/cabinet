  <content>C.C. 74(61).					14th December, 1961.

	1.	Parliament.		[Enter  M.R.

I.M.	Business for next week.
		Monday:  Incomes.  S.Ll. and Fin. Secy. or H.B.  No need for
			P.M. to reply.
		Wed:  F. Affairs – Berlin.  L.P.S. and Godber – unless H.W. 
			needed to reply.
		Thurs:  Adjournment debate.
	Comm. Immigrants Bill.  Must now have guillotine – 3 more days
		in Cttee and 2 for Rpt. &amp; 3rd Rdg.  Motion will be tabled before
		we rise.
	H/Lords Reform.  Labour want powers as well as composn.  Some 
		Tories want no enquiry.  Compromise:  enquiry into neither 
		powers nor composition but anomalies only.  This has bn.
		accepted by both sides, subject to Mr G. getting agreemt. of his
		supporters.  Omits remuneration.
	Business for week after Recess.

	2.	Congo.

E.H.	After consult. (incldg. F. Secy.) decided to ask formally in U.N. for
		cease-fire.
		Sec. Genl.’s lr. w’drawing request for bombs.
		Sec. Genl. will discuss with his advisory cttee our request for 
		cease-fire.
	U.S. repve:  they want cease-fire if it can be combined with definite
		guarantee of mtg. betwn. A. &amp; T.  If I can be persuaded (by
		Bunche) to go to mtg. place (Katona) with A., Bunche will
		accompany him as equal hostage.  Conciliator, if needed as 
		alternative – Stevenson wd. be willing to act.

P.M.	Anglo-U.S. rift is not as great as appears from Press.
		Have spoken to Mr K. – he agreed U.N. military have bn. going
		to far.
	Situation in H/C. looks better.
		Most awkward point for me:  why did we change betwn. Thurs.
		&amp; Mon.  Wd like to give full facts – incldg. my surprise tht. they
		were unwilling to accept bombs on our conditions.

E.H.	Attack will be v. our original decn of Thursday, not v. our change of
		mind.

	3.	Goa.

E.H.	G-B. saw Nehru y’day &amp; lodged written repns.  N. gave no assurance.
		Said restraint had produced no result.  U.S. Amb. has also heard
		from M.J. Desai tht. if P. didn’t budge in 2 or 3 days India wd.
		have to act.
		P.M. message also sent to N.
	At noon we shall let it be known we have made repns to India and P.
	Suggestn (by P.) of observers – not to be selected by U.N.  We shall
		say we wd. support such a plan if acceptable to both sides.
	Staging rights.  J.A. worried about Azores.  We have ascertained 
		it’s 2 aircraft = one with 130 soldiers at once:  further flight in
		2 wks.  We said we cdn’t allow Gan Al Adun wd. need
		Libyan permission, wh. is unlikely.  Offered to consider other
		routes if P. can suggest one.
	We are thus keeping it open.  Not clear, however, tht. they cd. fly
		from Mauritius to Goa in one hop.

	4.	Commercial Policy:  i) Polish Bacon.

F.E.	4.000 t. in all.  Effect on exporters will be more serious than on
		farmers.

C.S.	I cd. conceal our draft on next year of 1200;  but not 4.000.
		This is only area in wh. we can control meat imports.  If we
		do this, we shall aggravate posn of S. Estimate, wh. is diff. 
		enough already.

H.B.	Both instances fall w’in P.M.’s directive on exports (Sept.):  we must
		be ready to favour exports even at cost to domestic positions.

P.T.	0.2% of meat market:  and it gives chance to sell Viscounts into 
		Poland with prospect of continuing trade.  Vickers loss of £15 m.

P.M.	But can we afford commitment on agric. subsidies.

F.E.	Doesn’t follow tht. it will be net increase of bacon imports:  Polish
		competes with Danish, of which there may be less.

C.S.	It will spoil any chance of getting vol. limitn of imports from our
		traditional suppliers.  How then can I hope to support meat 
		market.

H.B.	Agree this is long-term aim.  But I’m advised we now have no
		chance of getting voluntary agreement.

M: J.H: D.E.	We can’t allow our posn to be eroded on the meat market ques.

H.B.	Ty. view is tht. b/advantage here is in favour of supporting exports
		of aircraft.

J.H.	If we get the exports, Poles will ask us to take more foodstuffs to
		pay for them.

P.T.	Not necessarily.  If they have Viscounts pressure will be on them to
		be able to get spares etc.
S.Ll.	Believe 1.200 t. won’t be decisive on limiting meat imports – whereas
		sale of Viscounts will firmly establish us in this market.

P.M.	Make the concession to Poland on the basis of a carry-forward, 
		if possible.
	Take extra 1.200 tons &amp; consider best means of presentation.

	ii)	Romanian Meat.

C.S.	We increased quota in last 2 yrs. &amp; they have not met it – by 1 m. tons.		We aren’t importg. any beef from them in fact.  Doubt if they
		will.
		We cd. get all the odium for nothing.
	Why not tell them to fill these first?

F.E.	We knew they wdn’t fill these because our condns.
		They now ask for 20.000 t.  Unless we give 5.000 we shan’t get
		renewal of agreement.

H.B.	Favour doing this for prestige reasons – on faith tht. beef won’t come
		in.  We have a rising trade with them wh. wd. be imperilled if
		we declined this.

I.M.	Not surely in context of Suppl. on meat.

			Agreed:  no offer.

	5.	I.M. Fund.		[Enter  R.W., P.M.G.

S.Ll.	3½ billion dollars of Western money is being added.  Our share wd.
		be contingent if U.S. have to make large drawing.
	Sick authy to accept this in principle.
	It will need legn.  But success in enlarging credit resources.
		This is fruit of initiative we took last spring.
			Approved.

	6.	Wages Policy.

P.M.	No further use of “guiding light” in any official document.
			Agreed.

S.Ll.	Main issues  i)	how to deal with pay-pause.
			  ii)	do I adopt alternative II – money vice percentage.
	Ty. draft of statement circulated.
	i) paras. 2 and 5 of draft statement.
		T.U.’s are not expecting me to announce a date for its end.  They
		wd. be content with further indication tht. it is only a temporary
		policy.

M.	Enough to omit words “the pause continues”.
P.M.	Speech shd. be v. simple.  Start:  earning too little &amp; spending too
		much.  First need is to earn more.  Stress that.  Positive work of 
		N.E.D:  that is what Cttee is for.  Marginal effort by all wd. give
		us the extra 3% or so which wd. make all the difference.  The
		other side is interim, what do we do about spending too much
		before we have earned more.  Pause inevitably rough &amp; ready:
		Can’t expect perfection in impoverished interim plan.  Then go
		on with long-term policy on incomes.  Before we reach that,
		there will have to be some relaxation from an absolute pause,
		in words wh. prepare way for, e.g. some early increase in
		rlwaymen’s wages.

Hail.	Policy in draft is right:  but presentn too rough.

J.H.	S.Ll. shd. be ready to meet T.U.C. on Wed. next – p.m:  announcg. 
		tht. he is going ahead with the office.  Then another mtg. early
		in Jan.  Announce new form of pause before end/Jan.  Otherwise
		various T.U.’s will have got themselves into fixed posns.  Favour
		statement in Jan. forecastg. end of pause in present form at end
		of fin. year.

P.M.G.	Agree.  Postmen &amp; C.S. Unions likely to get into fixed posns in
		January.  They may press for negotns after S.Ll.’s 1st statement
		on Monday.  This will be awkward.
	Para. 5.  What are the post pause interim arrangements?  We shall be
		pressed to say.

P.M.	Avoid “arrangements” – approach or policy.

Hail.	Pause shd. fade out.  “Phase” vice “end”.

S.Ll.	Consultn on incomes wd. not be done, at outset, thro’ planning
		N.E.D. Cttee.

P.T.	Effect on rlway. claim?  Tough (2½%) or easy	(5%)?

I.M.	Fundamental unease in Party is over wages policy.
		On Mon. S.Ll. has to rise 2 horses:  tough on thrift – 
		encouraging on growth.  After speech, we shall be judged
		by action:  and rlway. settlement will be taken as test of our
		intention.  Needs to be tough.

P.M.	Importance of date – and an arbitration decision.

P.T.	If we end pause by 5-6% award to rlwaymen., wtr. by arbitn or not,
		stiff re-actions from Party.  This wd. be £26 m. – equivalent
		to our cut in nutritional services.  It wd. wreck any pause.

M.	Read minutes of Wage Cttee mtg. of 11/12.

F.E.	The £500 m. figure wd. lead to scramble for a share of it.
		Better to put fwd. test:  no increase wh. wd. increase 
		price/product.

Hail.	Many claims fr. people who make no product.

D.E.	Monday’s statement foreshadows attempt to relate incomes to
		productivity, within a policy of growth, &amp; to make that policy
		work.  Last para. of draft poses alternative.
	Is it worth trying to get 2 sides of industry together – and put 
		everything into attempt to get understandg. of new policy.
		This draft is v. discouraging.  It must contain real incentive to
		those who do increase national income.  Dutch experience –
		they have had to give more than national average to this sector.

F.E.	But Dutch T.U.’s have accepted tht. they can’t expect wage increases
		wh. involve price increases.

P.T.	Danger of our sitn.  Wage pause while we thght. out means of
		handling this more sensibly.  Then it ends with 6% for rlways.
		Ty. will then be driven into deflationary measures – and what
		happens about “growth”?
	Real ques. for us is, not what S.Ll. says on Mon., but what we do
		afterwards.

D.E.	Continuance &amp; increase of subsidy to rlways. at current level are
		not consistent with cuts we have bn. considerg. e.g. in education.

I.M.	Failure to stand firm on wage policy will bring us down politically.

Hail.	But how can we run rlways. w’out a policy which will attract labour.

R.M.	Agree with I.M. on rlways.
		My main worry is wtr. N.E.D. can do much to promote growth.
Hail.	Move from “wages pause” to “limitation of incomes”.

S.Ll.	Country and Party are expecting us to say “no” to rlwaymen.

M.	Rejection of engineers’ claim y’day is of great significance.

I.M.	What about a general direction to all natd industries – so as to 
                    x/		avoid “illegality” of special direction on particular wage claim.

			Agreed:  Ty. to consider x/.

S.Ll.	We cd. presumably say tht. any wage increases wd. have to be 
		financed by increased charges or economies in operation:
		cd. not be financed by Exchequer money.
	Alternatives:  %age or figures.
		%age rejected because wd. be taken as minimum.  Figure cd.
		be translated to %age.

			Agreed:  in this speech, use neither.

Ch.H.	Para. 6. on arbitn needs qualification, if we are going to make any
		changes.  Wiser to omit – for to-morrow.

K.	Prefer to keep paras. 5-6:  on basis arithmetical facts of prodn shd. be
		put fwd.  Use more precise words.

S.Ll.	Not before consultns with T.U.’s.
