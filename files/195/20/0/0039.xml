  <content>C.C. 13(62).					13th February, 1962.

	1.	Berlin.	[Enter  M.R.

H.	Agreed in W’ton tht., tho’ no progress, we shd. try to keep talks going.  Thght. Roberts – or prs. Kroll – might play a part.
	Will report at next Cabinet.

	R. threat to air corridor.  Was attempt to interfere with its working.
	U.S. &amp; we have rejected R. request, &amp; it was w’drawn.
	But Fri. they practised a.a. fire to 6.000 ft.
	Possible they will now try a land probe.

	2.	Disarmament.

H.	K.’s response to our initiative – mtg. of 18 at summit.
	U.S. reaction:  unwise:  better F. Ministers shd. start:  but have in mind Summit mtg.if favourable prospects open up.
	Proposed reply:  our procedure is wiser, but Summit later prs. if favourable progress made.

P.M.	Mr K. (phone conversation) is keep tht. we shd. take practical line.  18 is too many.  Dief., however, thght. K. had overtrumped us.  We must take practical line for a time:  but take care – for if others indicate readiness awkward to stand out.  We might suggest mtg. of 3 F. Ministers first as condn of attendance of Heads of Govt. at mtg. of 18.

	3.	Congo.

H.	U.N. wish to put troops into 2 places when Union Miniere operates.  (O.K. if Tsombe agrees.)  Their professed reason:  mercenaries there who can pop to and fro’ across frontier territory.  Real reason:  to bring pressure on U. Miniere to pay more of revenue to Adoula.  If so, use of force for pol. ends.  R.W. askg. for advice, telling him to urge T. to agree with U.N. now these troops shd. be unemployed.  If resisted by Katangano, U.N. troops wd. fight.

P.M.	Our line:  try to get T. to agree.  No need for us to interfere if he can arrange this with U.N.

	4.	Incomes Policy:  Railwaymen’s Wages.

S.Ll.	Claims ahead:  gas want to give 4%:  I.C.A. want to break the line.
	(prs. 2½% but from ⅓.)

P.M.	I must try to hold 3% for rlways.  Awkward if gas goes ahead.

M.	Must hold gas back – we cd. stand a strike.
E.M.	Gas had already had 6% since rlways last rise.

P.M.	Can’t let gas follow bad precedent of electricity.

S.Ll.	Avoid creating any class of underpaid, who must now catch up.

J.H.	That wd. restore comparability in its old for.

P.M.	Will discuss my proposed line with Ministers concerned to-morrow – ll.30.

J.H.	Gleam of hope idea won’t be v. useful to the steady element in Unions.
	Believe we are faced with risk of strike.
	Further offer wd. mean a strike in autumn or 5% for 1962.

P.M.	Can say i) 3% is above the 2½% &amp; marks their difft posn.  2) They are free to ask later in the year for more:  can’t commit ourselves:  but if progress m’while in rationalisation etc., negotns wd. begin in better spirit.

P.T.	V. serious if they feel encouraged to think they will         [Enter R.A.B.
	Get another 2% in autumn.

S.Ll.	Any advance beyond 3% will open flood-gates in private sector.
			[Enter  D.   Exit  E.M.

	5.	Federation of Rhodesia etc.

P.M.	Sosco. 6.  Reachg. another point of crisis.
	Course contemplated in its concludg. paras. means end of Federation.
	Kaunda cd. not be outbid by Banda.
	We had bn. realising Fedn cdn’t continue in present form.  But had bn. hoping to substitute some looser form.  Banda now declare he will go in the other direction.
	Agree with para. 8.  But Banda won’t be here until April:  we have a little time.  Doubt therefore wtr. we shd. go as far as para. 10.  Rather let D.S. &amp; R.W. try to devise plan for dealing with situation.  cf. R.W. speech of y’day.

H.	Earlier demands of 2 northern territies was African majorities &amp; right to secede.  Plan for this was worked out by Monckton.
	R.W. was willing to concede secession in 5 yrs. (with immediate transfer of some powers) in return for independence.  This is virtual acceptance of Monckton.
	Alternative:  remove Nyasaland.  That wd. break - Fedn unless you tied N. Rh. into Fedn as act of Sate, with right to secede reserved to a much later date.
	We can’t give snap decision on Sosco. 6.
 
R.M.	Endorse para 6.  But wrong to press R.W. at once i) his speech of y’day.  ii) …  iii) we must consider what we do after break-up.  Banda previously was ready to co-operate with Fedn after secession.  Try to get him back to that.

S.Ll.	Financial implicns also need study.

R.M.	Para 3(b) is only new factor in B.’s attitude.

I.M.	B. is amendable to influence in Ldn.  Don’t accept para. 3 until we have discussed.  Real chance we cd. bring him round to acceptance of a new form of Fedn with the Rhodesias.

H.B.	Don’t be rushed.  N. ‘going it alone’ wd. need financial help.

P.M.	Personal tel. encouraging R.W. to act in time, not too late.

K.	R.W.’s point (dissoln of Fedn only with consent of Fed. Govt) based on Jennings.  L.O. to consider.	[Exit  S.Ll.
