  <content>C.C. 31(62).					3rd May, 1962.

	1.	Economic Situation (resumed).

P.M.	Will consider report of this a.m.’s discussion &amp; take up points later.
		M’while, right way of using N.E.D.C. on wages:  invite them 
		to consider the means of increasg. industrial efficiency which
		wd. make it possible to pay higher wages.
	Can we dramatise our approach - presentation - picking out some
		targets.
	If so, we must mobilise all Ministers – and also back-benchers.

	2.	Canada.

P.M.	In a bad way.  Invested in the boom, now in trouble.  Devalued
		currency.
	Politically, we shall get nothing from existg. Adminn – esp. Dief.
		They tend to criticise C. Market on principle w’out considering 
		merits.
	J.D. may run campaign on patriotic anti-U.S. line.
	Public, and business people, are more realistic about C. Market.
		They believe we wd. influence it twds. expansion.
	People are v. friendly to U.K.
	Narrow result, whichever way election goes.

	3.	U.S.A.

P.M.          i)	In spite of Keynsian policies, Admn is finding diffy in getting 
		economy moving.  Row with steel is popular, but rather 
		demagogues.  The steel cos. cd. have done it more sensibly –
		by items instead of average increases &amp; not doing it so soon.  
		Even so, some shadow of New Deal – risk of losing co-opn of 
		business.
                 ii)	Defence.  Mr K. is in diffies:  better armed v. Govt. agencies because
		keeps his counsel in narrow circle.  Disappointed at out-turn of 
		tests ques:  but looks as tho’ R. will do another series.  After that
		U.S. might be ready to give it up.
		Nuclear strength of R. &amp; U.S. has got much too large.  To catch 
		up R. must have devoted enormous resources.  A nuclear
		exchange wd. kill 100 m. Europe, 130 in U.S. &amp; 200/250 m. in 
		U.S.  What will happen to credibility of deterrent when that is 
		more widely known.  Will Govts. be willing to risk that sort of
		destruction?  If not, this is instrument wh. will never be used.  		This is what causes them to think of larger conventional forces –
		as reply to e.g. nipping out Hamburg.
		U.S. have eliminated pre-emptive R. war – by protection of sites
		&amp; Polaris as 2nd strike.
		But, unlike previous Adminn, this one believes tht. some day all
		this nuclear business must stop.
		K.’s emphasis, in speeches &amp; interviews, are largely on his 
		domestic problems.  This must reflect recognition of huge cost,
		in resources of nuclear effort.
                iii)	Summit Mtgs.  I’m anxious to concentrate this year on C. Market.
		Mr K. understands this - &amp; recognises its importance to us.
		He accepts tht. pro. tem. we shd. avoid mtgs. which wd.
		exacerbate de G.
                iv)	Berlin:  W. Alliance.   U.S. annoyed with Fr. and G.  Cross at thought
		tht. U.S. will be said to have sold Germans.  Tried to make Mr K.
		realise tht. this is price of power.  But not sure any progress will
		be made on Berlin – not a settlement anyway:  perhaps 
		modus Vivendi which works on.  That wd. give us respite until
		we are ready to go forward on tests.  Avoid Summit failure.
                v)	General relations with U.S. are good.  Won’t be affected by our entry
		into C. Market.  Depends, not on our power nor on our nuclear
		capabbilty, but on fact tht. they can trust us as they can’t trust
		French etc.
                vi)	Irritants – tariffs.  Protection is traditional in U.S. &amp; has now extended
		to the South.  Pressure to let Tariff Commn have final decision.
		He must accept some of their recommendations, or he may lose
		his jurisdiction.
		On shipping I have promised to send him a memo.

R.A.B.	Opinion here is not sure what U.S. motive is in pressing for our entry
		into C. Market.  Must be political, not economic.  Suspicion
		therefore that our sovereignty may be impaired
	Press – brought out well tht. we are defending C’wealth interests.

P.M.         vii)	Colonialism.  Co-ordination W’ton/N. York.	 [Enter  Hailsham, M.R.
	Congo:  Anglo-U.S.-Belgian co-ordinated policy.
