		1.	Wages Policy			[Enter R.W., E.P., P.M.G., M.R

S.L.I.	Apart from matters reserved by Govt. from time to time, all wage claims in C. Service have for 40 yrs. been subject to arbitration.
	Applcns pending or in course : we must therefore take a line v. soon.
	Alternative courses – as in memo.  Diffies. in 3rd course : a) the arbitrators might discount delay &amp; accumulate no. of large post-dated cheques.  A 4th course : we can’t avoid arbitn. procedures &amp; can’t avoid being bound by awards - &amp; hope arbitrators will take a/c of national interests : but I doubt if they wd : also disparity with classes (e.g. N.H.S) not covered by arbitration.
	Three discussions in Cab. Cttees.

J.H.	Either cause will come diffies. : but (iii) is the least difficult.
	(i) or (ii) wd. cause immediate difficulties : set wrong atmosphere for pause : we shd. seem to be seeking a clash with Unions : system of arbitration wd. be gravely damaged in long-term.
	Under course (iii) procedures of negotiation cd. be continued : they wd. even be prolonged.  Will do the least damage to arbitration.
	Will impress on aribitrators tht. Govt. consider the crisis serious.

P.T.	Difficult – and crucial.  Last round of wage increases was £100m : dwarfs what we can do on public expenditure.
	Choice : accept arbitn. but reserve our posn. on amount and date.
	or say we can’t change existg. procedure &amp; will comply with it whenever we can’t avoid it.
		On balance prefer course (iii).

E.P.	Agree with analysis : but on principle believe we shd. not break agreements : but, when we are free, make no offers and decline arbitration.

I.M.		(iii) represents destruction of arbitn.
		Arbitn. – tho’ it catches headlines – affect only 7% of all increases.
	Another possible course : Last time we were tough on N.H.S. clerks and on bus strike (where we stood firm on an arbitration award).  Cd. we not do the same now?  Stand on teachers : let M/L. choose a good Wages Council case to put back.  Two or three examples shd. have effect.

E.M.	Rlways. 8% behind.  Claim is in.  Cd. be taken to arbitration – when 8% wd. be awarded.

Hail.		Policy now is tht. during the pause comparability is not conclusive.

J.H.		I.M’s line won’t do the trick.
		Govt. has reserved right, on policy, to decline to go arbitn. (App)
		On chorley &amp; equal pay we delayed as an act of policy.

M.	(iii), is best we can do in C.S. because we have commitments (arbitn. agreement) wh. we must honour.  But same doesn’t apply in wider field – incldg. rlwaymen.

Ch.H.	To follow I.M. line we shd. have to wait for a claim in N.H.S. or Wages Council field.  In C.S. we are bound by arbitn. agreement – unless we can say tht. pause is an act of policy comparable to those on a/c of which we have w’held claims fr. arbitn. in past.  I believe it is.  We cd. for this reason follow (iii).  I support that.

J.M.	I agree.  If arbitrator awarded 7% when 4% was enough in present circs., intelligible to give 4% and have 3% in abeyance for later.

H.B.	Agree.  Mtg. with l.a.’s successful : they will support our line : But not if we allow C.S. arbitration to make a vent in our policy.  Believe they wd. be ready to follow course (iii) also.

H.W.	In penumbra, when we pay w’out control, can we not put Govt. case at an arbitration.

D.E.	Purpose of pause : to give time to move to policy of ensuring tht. wages don’t outstrip production.  Problems i) how to fix limit ; job for new planning organn. ii) w’in that total must be scope for betterment for certain classes.
	Deduction in wp. of public sector : must take course (iii).
	Test by teachers : no betterness if I cd. say “only £42m now : but when productivity rises, you will have then further £3½m.”

K.	This is matter of high policy – and arbitn. can be modified on that account consistently with past practice.

P.M.G.	Agree with para. 12. – which is consistent with course (iii), which I support.

R.A.B.	Agree with I.M. and E.P.  Major breach of arbitration.  Cd. we do this as soon as Parlt. rises?  Wd. worsen our stance for the situation in the autumn.

E.M.	How on that basis am I to deal with rlwaymen’s claim?

C.S.	If we don’t take course (iii), what employer in private sector will resist claims?

J.H.	However unpalatable, unless we set this example, no private employer will enforce a pause.

R.W.	‘Correct’ course is that advocated by R.A.B., E.P. &amp; I..M.  But it won’t accuse a pause : it will destroy the policy.
	Wd. it help to present this as part of policy (link with productivity) wh we are trying to work out.
	Diffies. with natd. Indies. we seek to apply (iii) to them.  We can ask them : but they mayn’t be willing to accept consequences (Strikes).

H.	Cd we start procedure by wh. Govt. put national case in an arbitn. to which Govt. are not parties.

H.W.	Need we make general statement?  Deal only with cases as they arise?

J.H.	It will leak.

Ch.H.	Need for general statement – to show we mean business &amp; within what field.

P.M.	This is v. difficult.
	One course : declare tht. comp. arbitn. is no longer appropriate : honour those in pipline : but have no more.
	Another : present this as interim suspension, while we work out a new policy.
	Under one or other (?) use argument in para 4 of Appendix.
	Perhaps S.L.I. will circulate a draft announcement in the light of this discussion.
	Discussion to be resumed on Friday a.m. 11.00.

								[Enter Att.G.
	2.	South Africa.

K.	Offl. Cttee. reports considered by Africa Cttee., who approved recommns. on most points w’out modification.
	Nationality : anything more wd. suggest no value in remaining in c’wealth Trade Relations:
	High Commission Territories.
	Repeal of S. Africa Act. Wait &amp; see re-action of S.A. twds Territories.
	Sugar.
	Tactics of negotiation.

R.A.B.	Agree with these recommendns.

D.E.	Sugar – rounds v. expensive.

K.	If we don’t we shd. have to by Swazi sugar ourselves.  Also this is sweetener to our general trading posn. with S. Africa.

S.L.I.	We pay this price only if we get all our other points : it would then be worth it.

K.	Min. of 4 yrs and max. of 7 yrs.  
C.S. 	Hope we can limit to 4 yrs.
	Cost of bargain : £2½m. 16/17.000t  Swaziland out of 150.000t

P.M.	Departmental responsibility.  Outlined this plan.
	Date reserved.

I.M.	New Ministers cd. usefully be associated with negotns.  [Exit Att.G.

	3.	Commercial Policy : Japan.

	Memo. approved.

	4.	United Nations : Finance.

P.M.	Let H. talk to Rusk.  We can pay no more.
