  <content>C.C. 8(62).				25th January, 1962.

	1.	I.C.I. and Courtaulds.	[Enter  M.R.

F.E.	Alternative drafts.  A. wd. cause immediate row &amp; show Govt. 
		powerless.  B. wd. avert that, but land us in a row 2 wks. ahead if
		I then seemed to have no firmer opinion on the merits.
	On balance, favour B.
	On powers, we wd. technically be able to revive Control of Borrowing
		Act – cd. prohibit issue of shares.
	Jenkins, however, will say tht. take-over bids &amp; mergers are essential
		to growth of national economy.
	Other mergers are under discussion e.g. Charringtons.

P.M.	Ignore personalities &amp; current conflict.  Concentrate on merits:  is this
		in national interest.

M.	Mistake to promise (as in B.) that we will pronounce after discussions.
		Tho’ I prefer B.  For A. implies tht. we dislike I.C.I. pressure on
		Courtaulds.

I.M.	Avoid pronouncing what is &amp; what is not in public interest.
		Prefer A. – re-worded so as to avoid green light for I.C.I.
		Don’t promise talks.

Hail.	Favour posture, not words, of A.  B. suggests there may be a Govt.
		position in this:  there isn’t.  There is no natl reason yet why we
		shd. intervene.

H.W.	Against intervention.

E.H.	Favour this merger, in natl interest.  Against enquiry.  Bad precedent.
		Non-intervention, with bias twds. either company.

H.	Agree.  Clear we shan’t intervene.

K.	We shd. not intervene.  But worried at reception of such a policy by 
		Party.

S.Ll.	Not yet in posture where we cd. say we won’t intervene.  Favour B.
		Tho’ agree tht. we shd. ultimately decide not to intervene.

H.B.	Our position shd. be as positive as possible.  We shd. not intervene,
		but shd. be seen to take time to reach that concln.

D.E.	How big has a merger to be before oblign on Govt. to look into it &amp;
		decide wtr. to intervene.
	All intelligent people in City wd. see that this was a bluff.

P.T.	This has brought to a head pressures on mergers which we shan’t be 
		able to ignore.  Against intervention in this case.  No powers. 
		Monopolies Commn useless.  Against Govt. expressg. opinions
		which they can’t enforce.
	Add to statement references to i) consumers  ii) use of tariffs.
	We may be forced eventually to consider takg. powers on mergers –
		after Jenkins reports.

J.H.	Against intervention, but support S.Ll.

E.M.	Prefer S.Ll.  B. – adding x/ “especially on technical &amp; research 
		aspects”.

C.S.	We can’t judge public interest here:  don’t pretend we can:  false to
		suggest tht. in a little time we could.

Ch.H.	If we cd. isolate x/, &amp; if we cd. see what judgmt. we cd. form on it,
		I mght. favour S.Ll.  But I see no hope of that.
		If we really believe we shan’t intervene, better take that line
		soon.  No advantage in delay.

D.S.	We shall get into deep water if we start expressing views on mergers.
		This one is prob. in natl interest, esp. because of C. Market.
	Two public interest aspects i) monopoly:  no real danger because
		increasing internatl competn.  ii) efficiency:  we aren’t 
		competent to judge.  F.E. won’t be any the wiser for further talks.

J.M.	Agree with Ch.H.  If there is need for further mtgs. with Chairman,
		hold them w’out this preliminary statement.

S.ll.	Probe reasons for change of attitude of Courtaulds.  P’pone any
		statement m’while.

E.H.	Delay is not advantageous.

Hail.	Esp. when we are not really doing anything – we are not.

M.R.	If Govt. are coming down on non-intervention, sooner they say so the
		better.

P.M.	As no powers, better say so soon.
		Before Election, we must have a philosophy on it.
		Make statement early next week (Tuesday):  non-
		intervention.
		No harm if B/T. appeared to have bn. getting further
		informn m’while.
		Re-draft statement so as to suggest some foundations for 
		a new philosophy.  I.M., M. and P.T. to help F.E. in
		its preparation.

	After further discussion – better prs. to have short statement
	indicatg. tht. after going into it all we see no ground to intervene.
	Reserve wider considns for debate.
	F.E. appeared to dissent.
                      *Better to give Chambers &amp; H. Williams another opportunity to make
		any repns.

	2.	Parliament.		[Enter  R.A.B.

I.M.	Mon. 29/1.  Economic Policy debate.  Will include wages
		policy.  J.H. &amp; H.B.
	Mon. 5.2.  Debate on U.N.  H.’s speech.

S.Ll.	If Mon. debate is on industrial relations, Ty. Ministers might 
		disengage.
		Shd. not I.M. speak?

P.M.	Prefer that:  widen the field, beyond the details of wage claim.

	3.	Economic Situation.

S.Ll.	Reply of T.U.C. on N.E.D.C.  Satisfactory.

	4.	Government Expenditure.		[Enter E.P., J.B-C.
						[Exit  E.M.

H.B.	Large rise in Estimates.  How are we to present these?  Whatever decns
		on milk &amp; meals (which need not be taken to-day) we are well
		above S.Ll.’s pledge.  Long-term decisions are even more 
		important.
	Real need is to avoid commitment to forward expanding p’mmes.
	Urgent ques. here:  education:  because M/E. is overdue in telling 
		l.e.a.’s what p’mme will be for 1963/4.

K.	Any chance of fulfilling S.Ll.’s 2½% pledge.

H.B.	No.  £36 m. on meals &amp; milk.  No other policy decisions in view
		which wd. close remaining gap.  Confidence in £ must therefore
		rest on apparent success in bringing forward expenditure under
		control.

D.S.	What was basis for pledge?

S.Ll.	Assumed a lower transport deficit, and less expenditure on 
		agriculture.  These 2 developments have knocked the props
		from under it.

Hail.	The big stuff seems out of our control.  Those which are at 
		discretion are small &amp; politically painful.

H.B.	Changes in agric. policy w’in our pledges for this Parlt. are marginal.
		That problem therefore remains with us.

C.S.	£50 m. saving, however, on meat prices, slowing rise in c/living.

P.M.	Open-ended commitments – agriculture and railways.
	We must give B.T.C. full support for his economies – e.g. closing 
		branch lines whatever political diffies.

	5.	Education Investment.

H.B.	Difference of philosophy.  We agree success in wage policy will 
		favour long-term growth.  D.E. argues therefore no interference
		with anything which interferes with long-term growth.  I believe
		we can’t go on w’out assurance of getting thro’ next few years:
		if we fail then, no growth thereafter.
	D.E.	wants 4.6% expansion when g.n.p. will give only 3%.  In short
		run educn doesn’t contribute to growth.  Allocation of resources:
		we shd. not draw too much away from private enterprise &amp;
		exports.
	I wish to slow down rate of interest.  D.E. wants to rise to £131 m.
		I believe we can’t afford more than £121 m.  If my view 
		accepted, he must at once warn l.e.a.’s tht. provisional p’mme
		for 63/64 won’t be fully implemented;  and p’mme for 64/65
		must also be smaller.

D.E.	Para. 4 of C. 4 includes p’ponement of some training coll. projects.
	Minor works.  I agreed to cut by 1/3rd.
	Other parts – all known &amp; announced.  I can’t accept p’ponement of
		teacher training p’mme, which is too late &amp; too little.  I have
		arranged 1 year slip under cover:  anything more wd. have to be
		announced.  Result:  clear we shd. be doing v. little to reduce
		size of classes.  On techn. training:  any cut wd. mean telling 
		l.e.a.’s they must p’pone.  Therefore any cut must come on 
		schools p’mme.  This is not ‘provisional’:  it is progress under
		1958 W. Paper wh. promised £300 m. building over 5 years –
and, with increased prices, wd. now be £320 m. starts £64, £65, £66, £70, £70 over 5 years.  I assume we don’t announce we are w’drawg. from W. Paper.  Short of that I cd. offer £60 in next 2 years, 1963/4 and 1964/5.  Over 3 years average of work done would then be £131 m.  To get down to £121 m. we shd. have to push £10-15 m. starts out of 1st year and £18-20 m. in 2nd.  This wd. involve starting-date procedure and stopping some work wh. is ready to go.
	Prize we seek now is change of attitude – restraint in incomes, by
		about 50% of what they are now used to.  Public won’t accept
		unless it’s seen tht. growth is in forefront of our p’mme.
	H.B.’s plan wd. have no effect on no. of teachers – no limit on that –
		and that is what affects current expenditure.  W’out that we 
		can’t get below 4.6% expansion on current expre.

S.Ll.           x|	Starts:  £131 m. in 24 months (D.E.) shd. be spread over 28 months.
                     |		Is that such a large request?

D.E.	Even this small amount involves starting-date control because of size
		of bldg. in pipe-line.

H.B.	What is diffy of phasing out?  Others have done it.
		Was July ’60 p’mme provisional?  I can’t accept that it wasn’t.		My plan would slow down expansion so as to reduce current
		expre to 4.25%.

D.E.	Only if you p’pone techn. &amp; teacher training parts of p’mme, which
		I can’t accept.

H.B.	I don’t insist on any particular allocation.  Tho’ big expansion of 
		t. training p’mme is already well under weigh:  we shd. only be
		phasing out the last small part.

S.Ll.	Adding expre on Universities, which we shd., the figures for 
		expansion of investment expre is v. large indeed.

Hail.	Agree we shd. look at it all:  for Univ. expansion is even more 
		important.

H.B.	i)  Putting too many people etc., in education will strengthen our posn
		in 1970’s.  But won’t help us thro’ 60’s.  Analogy of M.A.P. 
		in 1940.
	ii) Will other p’mmes be cut to make room for expanding educn
		p’mme.

H.	Is a spread of 4 months over 2 yrs. so difficult?

H.B.	Can’t he say tht. since p’sional p’mme announced, econ. crisis:
		therefore the starts will have to be phased out:  &amp; same in
		following year.

R.A.B.	As we can’t redeem 2½% pledge, we must show we are making 
		impact on longer term.  We shall have to show we are doing
		something to curb investment expre on education as well as
		other p’mmes.

H.B.	63/64 p’mmes ought to come down by £50 m.  Hard on all.  But can’t 
		be achieved unless M/E. contributes £15 m.  D.E. offers 
		only £5 m.

P.M.	We can’t hope to redeem pledge on current expre.
	Investment expenditure.  Totality:  not all production.  Relation to
		private sector.  Shd we not control non-productive investment
		in private sector?  Can we justify starting dates for schools
		w’out having establd that?
	Cd R.A.B. try to work out practical plan with H.B. and D.E. – or
		alternative proposals.  On educational investment, taking account
		of Universities.
	Will S.Ll. also consider need for bldg. controls – if this industry is to
		be leader in inflation.

Hail.	Discouragement, short of physical controls.

E.H.	How wd. that succeed in private sector, when we can’t fix priorities
		even for public investment.  Ty. talks of fair shares:  we ought
		to think in terms of priorities.

R.A.B.	Can I proceed on assumptn that Edn must make a contribn twds.
		long-term expenditure.

P.M.	Yes:  and consider form of a general announcement in which 
		education wd. form part.
					[Exit  S.Ll., E.P., J.B-C.
	6.	Angola.

P.M.	Are we ready to vote for a resoln critical of Portugal.

H.	My concln is tht. we can – indicatg. that some of its language is
		exaggerated.  We shall be with the majority.
	If we don’t we shall be in minority with S.A. &amp; Portugal.

				Adjourned until 5.30 p.m., H/C.
