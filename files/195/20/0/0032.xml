  <content>C.C. 6(62).					18th January, 1962.

	1.	Incomes Policy.     Railways.   [Enter  E.P., R.W.,   P.M.G., M.R.

S.Ll.	Other claims are being postponed.
	B. Feels tht. on comparability nothing less than 6% wd. be 
		justifiable, and he is unwilling to offer less.  He wd. like to see 
		the claim p’poned:  and this cd. be explored.  But we must put
		Govt.’s view in writing to B. - 2½% average &amp; this is basis on
		which this claim must be handled either in negotn or at arbitn.
		He wd. prefer to be free to tell the men tht. he himself wd. have
		liked to offer more.  But he will say they must lag behind because
		of state of rlways:  &amp; if they raise recruitment he will reply with
		argument v. national rates.  Latter wd. be useful in arbitn.

E.M.	Will see B. this p.m., with M. and J.H:  ask him to seek p’ponement 
		until end/March – try to get Unions to agree.  Danger of it –
		unofficial strikes.  Then discuss terms of proposed letter &amp; 
		ascertain wtr. he wd. like to have it before or after he has seen
		Unions.

P.T.	At what stage does Govt. say it won’t honour an arbitn award
		inconsistent with their view of national economic interest.
		Must make that clear before arbitn starts?

S.Ll.	The Union won’t bind themselves to accept award.  Nor need we?
		This cd. be got across in guidance to Press – w’out formal Govt.
		announcement.

Ch.H.	S.Ll. hasn’t yet publicly come down between his 3 alternatives in lr. to
		T.U.C.  Is this lr. to come down in favour of 1st alternative, in 
		terms of 2½%.  It forces this issue.  How otherwise can we give
		guidance?

M.	Copy of this lr. will go simultaneously to Union.

I.M.	It will clear tht. B. thinks the offer shd. be higher than Govt. direction.
		This suggests we shd. direct him to offer nil.  Won’t surprise
		anyone tht. B. thinks it shd. be more than that.

J.H.	Dangers of p’ponement  i) unofficial strikes  ii) public will deduce tht.
		Unions have agreed because they believe they will get a better 
		deal in April.

P.M.	These dangers wd. be less if delay were shorter e.g. end/February.

E.M.	I fear negotn or arbitn under duress of unofficial strikes.

Hail.	Offer from B.T.C. of delay = promise of more later.  Dangerous.

P.M.	In lr. avoid direct instn to offer 2½% (because at arbitn
		that wd. be almost bound to lead to higher award).
		Aim shd. be to get to arbitration w’out any offer.

	2.	Nuclear Tests.

	Tels. to W’ton. 135/6.  From W’ton. 457/8.  To W’ton. 164.

P.M.	Mr K. still hopes to avoid further tests.  But pressures of p. opinion &amp;
		mil. &amp; some scientific opinion favours them.  He wants therefore
		a loophole for escape but wishes to make prepns.  For us it wd. be
		a better posture to say now they are military necessary but before
		we do it one more attempt to halt the race.  Rather paradoxical
		situation.
	My formula attempted to reconcile this.  Amendment in para. 3 of
		W’ton. 164 goes round in a circle.  We cd. accept ‘would justify’
		vice “justifies”.

H.W.	Already division in scientific circles, even in U.S., one ques. wtr. 
		further tests are military necessary.  We may be defendg. decn
		v. b’ground of U.S. statements are not necessary.  We can’t make
		our technical case in public.

P.M.	If we agree to Xmas I., &amp; Mr K. eventually decides to test, we can’t
		veto.

C.S.	We shd. do it only if obliged to do so.
		Factor, places oblign on West, in default of para. 2, to hold 
		further series.

P.T.	More than drafting.  Mr K. wants to prepare, while reserving ultimate
		decision.  We can’t avoid therefore leaving decn to the U.S.

I.M.	?Tell Mr K. tht. he has our full assurance tht. we will support a decn
		by him to test:  but it must appear to be a joint decision.
		Then announcemt. cd. be restricted to decision to prepare
		Xmas Island.

P.M.	Accept Rusk’s wording.  Suggest we shd. say publicly it will be a
		joint decision but private assurance we wdn’t veto.

P.T.	This is a v. big moral decn.  Only 8 wks. to	[Enter  H.   Exit  S.Ll.
		prepare Xmas Isl.  Wiser therefore to promise now to let U.S.
		have it if they decide to do the series.

C.S.	Supported this view.

P.M.	After further discussion – accept U.S. words for para. A. &amp; putting
		“present” vice “joint”.
	Then I wd. say that U.K. Govt. have decided this wd. be justified.
		If then Mr K. decided it wasn’t necessary, I cd. defend that as 
		a new position.
