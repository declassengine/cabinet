  <content>C.C. 11(62).					6th February, 1962.

	1.	The Queen.		[Enter  M.R.

	Message on 10th Anniversary of Accession.

	2.	Foreign Affairs.

	a)	Laos.

H.	Hostilities nearly broke out at week-end:  now looks hopeful again.
		The armies are poised.
	&amp; Mr Macdonald mght. be sent out to see the King.
	Mr K. seems determined now not to back Phonmi militarily if it
		goes wrong.

	b)	Berlin.

H.	Rumours of attack on K.
	Thompson’s 3rd talk.  No progress.  But Gromyko seems patient – no
		date threatened for Treaty.  He may invite Roberts to talk: 
		may be time for him to participate:  want him to indicate tht. if
		G. is interested in details (dealings with D.D.R., status of 
		W. troops) we have things to suggest.  This cd. be done w’in
		limits of T.’s brief.  As asking Gore what U.S. thinks.  Wd like
		to open it up a little.
	Tho’ R. may now be willing to let it drift along – for reasons we don’t
		know.

	c)	Leipzig Fair.

F.E.	We shall have to say publicly we don’t favour it.

P.M.	Let firms go if they want to.  Minimum gesture to N.A.T.O.  In fact
		W. Germans will be heavily represented &amp; do much business.

H.	But they (E. Germans) make big propaganda thing of it.

P.M.	We don’t boycott Moscow Fair.
	Conform to N.A.T.O. formula.  But don’t seek to discourage 
		individual firms.

P.T.	No public announcement here until after one made by others
		e.g. W. Germany &amp; France.

P.M.	Call attention (written Answer) to this N.A.T.O. statement.

	3.	West Indies.			[Enter  D.

R.M.	We must dissolve Fedn:  concede independence to Trinidad:  reserve
		possibility of smaller Fedn of small islands – setting up interim
		organisation to hold assets of existg. Fedn pro tem.
	Collapse must now be admitted:  and we must make new start.

H.B.	Financial implicns must now be studied – C.O./Ty.

P.M.	Deductions re C. Africa.

	4.	Antarctica:  S. Georgia Whaling.

R.M.	Scots enterprise can’t be run at profit &amp; want to sell to Japs.  The
		latter will prob. take over Norwegian enterprise:  &amp; Island
		will then be full of Japs. tho’ we wd. retain sovereignty.

D.	Shd like to consult A. &amp; N.Z. before announcement.  No reason to
                     x/	think they will object.

J.M.	Looks as tho’ we shall drop out of whaling altogether.  Salveson’s
		will sell 1 unit to Japs., and will prob. sell their other unit soon.
		They lost £200.000 in 2 yrs. at S. Georgia.

C.S.	If we don’t let them sell, they will demand subsidy.

H.B.	We won’t bind the tax, wh. we reduced to help Br. whalers.

H.	Will make our sovereignty claim less easy to defend – Argentines etc.,
		claim this island.

			Approved subject to x/.

	5.	Germany:  De-concentration of Krupps.

H.	No-one will take it over or buy the shares.
	Real ques:  timing.  Do we hang on until C. Market clears?
		Fr. &amp; U.S. may press us to settle this.

S.Ll.	Ty. view:  better do it when we are finally deciding wtr. to enter
		Iron &amp; Steel Community.  Wd seem more logical then.

E.H.	Agree:  we shd. then be participatg. in the control.
	In logic:    can’t get out of this w’out 3 Power agreement.
			better really tht. K. shd. hold this than have cash to
			put into somethg. worse – e.g. atomics.  At least he is 
			now under E.C.S.C.
	But diffy is emotional.  Fr. v. ready to accuse us of handing this back.
Hail.	Enough unpopular things already.

H.W.	Don’t want it mingled with G. purchase of arms.

P.M.	Do nothing:  say nothing:  take a leaf out of French book.
			Agreed:  no action pro tem.

	6.	Farm Price Review.

H.B.	No deep divisions betwn. us:  but one point for Cab. guidance.
	Last year £350 m.  Looks likely £339 M. for Estimates - £60 above
		last year.  Cab. wanted tough review this year:  and short-term
		economies consistent with pledge.  Of latter para. 2(2) is only
		runner.
	On review, if we insist on minimum we cd. save £14½ m. to
		Exchequer.  This is as far as we cd. go.  M/Ag. wants, however,
		to remove the 0.8d on milk given last year on condn tht. farmers 
		worked out a plan – they haven’t.  But redn in milk price wd.
		benefit consumer, not Exchequer:  &amp; our saving wd. be only
		£8 m.  Therefore, I say we must at same time abolish milk
		subsidy, costing £8 m. to Ty.  That wd. give saving of £16 m.
		to Ty.
	If we do nil. on milk, retail price wd. be 8d for 8 mos. &amp; 8½d for 4 mos.
	If we do my plan, result for consumer will be the same.  If we don’t
		w’draw subsidy, price mght. rise to 8½d in at least 1 further
		month.

C.S.	This issue doesn’t affect farmers – nor Review on wh. we agree.
	If we cut the 0.8d, milk price wd. be 8d thro’ year.  If we add H.D.’s
		point price will go up tho’ farmers get less.  Favour making
		consumer pay more of real price.  But this wd. put extra cost, 
		for milk he doesn’t consume:  wd. be represented as tax of 
		½ pint for 4 months.

P.M.  }	2.400 m. gall. produced:  1600 m. drunk.  300 is allowed as margin
H.B.  }		for drought.  Exch. subsidy for another 100 m.  So we finance
		2.000 m. at guaranteed prices.  Ques. is wtr. consumer shd. pay
		for the other 100 m.

S.Ll.	I want the £8 m. – leader in to-day’s Times.

D.E.	This removal of 0.8d will accelerate switch to beef.  Will that cost Ty		more?

H.B.	From Ty. angle I wd. sooner the 0.8d were not removed.

			Agreed  (I think) in favour of Ty.
