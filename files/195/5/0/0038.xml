C.M. 38(47) 22nd April 1947

1. Anglo. Egyptian Treaty

V.C.N.S. Vehicles must move – stores, commns. with Embassy. Troops

A.V.A. Pinpricks by Eg. Govt v. transit of troops.

P.M. Point is political : Nokrashi running nationalist stunt and whittling away our posn. under 1926 Treaty. Our posn. is strong on letter of Treaty : on reqn. of lorries : but not psychologically. Movement of troops : our Treaty position is not so clear in law. Effect of firmness can’t be certainly foretold : danger of disturbances. cd. be

moved by sea : extravagant, use of ships : and might involve delay in

re-inforcing Cyrenaica, when time factor might be important.

May be first in series of pinpricks.

D.M.O. We have enough troops to enforce transit. But not certain of being able to protect B. lives and property if disturbances occurred : w’out re-inforcing M/East. Shd. have enough if 3rd Divn. due to go fr. Italy to Germany, were retained in M/East. That wd. involve delaying release of some adminve. troops.

Mc.N. Defer decision. No reply to our telegram to E.B. of 19/4 or to Campbell on 17/4. Nokrashi may be considering his position. At least Cab. shd. know results of Campbell’s talk with Nokrashi. 2. Supply of Arms to Argentine

Deferred to Thursday.

.

P.M. Had agreed inter-departmentally to supply arms to Argentine.

U.S. wdn’t supply to this Govt. Shdn’t allow ourselves to be squeezed out by U.S.

H.D. Then go ahead.

Mc.N. But U.S. adminn. don’t want arms so supplied and will resent our

supplying.

They may make diffies. eg over food, finance etc. E.B. therefore wants Cab. support.

H.D. Why shdn’t E.B. speak to Marshall?

Mc.N. He doesn’t think it wise.

A.V.A. Believe U.S. firms are tendering.

H.D. Then they can’t object.

208

V.C.N.S. C-in-C. W. Indies touring S. America : offered in Argentine to buy from us : U.S. repve. offered cut price!

3. Anglo. Soviet Treaty.

P.M. As in memo.

Mc.N. E.B. had now changed his mind : keeping w’in Anglo. French model.

4. Cyrenaica. A.V.A. Have C.O.S. considered.

F.J.B. Para.3.(b). Form : Emir wants to nominate : subject to settling that to our satisfn we now agree to appointmt. of Council.

A.V.A. Para. 4(b). Who are these officers? Army only : or other Services or civil?

F.J.B. Mil. Govt. at present – with change over later.

V.C.A.S. No.

C.J. Consultn. with C.O. and we will help.

Para. 4(a). Some offrs. seconded are feeling restless at loss of prospects. 4(a) shdn’t be so absolute.

Para. 5. Something to be said for early declaration.

P.M. That is a ques. to be brought up as issue of major policy.

C.J. I don’t press my point on para. 5.

P.M. No public statement, at this stage.

H.D. Shdn’t Dpt. be considering now what kind of statement may have to be made here, or at a later stage.

P.M. No commitment re future sovereignty.

Agreed.

[Exit C.O.S., Hall., F.J.B. Mc.N. and Sargent.

5. Wheat Supplies.

J.S. As in his Minute to P.M.

P.M. a) Tho’ we are running on narrow margins, there is meat distribution.

b) Sunday you can arrange for more to go into holiday resorts.

209

J.S. On b) – only if millers can supply freely.

P.M. Makes nonsense of rationing not to use ration reduction for this

purpose.

H.D. Shdn’t modify Cab. decn. because effect on farmers.

Margin is so small you shd. be able to handle it otherwise.

A.V.A. The figures showed no suff. reason for this action.

Off-take has bn. so much higher.

J.S. Fallacy of averages. This won’t avoid individual bakers running out.

A.B. Agreed : but aren’t we entitled to assume a reduced demand from bakers, who have built up stocks.

J.S. Don’t rely on hopes. People have bn. eating more bread because shortage of potatoes.

A. What is ground for action? Bakers must have bigger stocks, which wd. tide us over next 6 weeks.

R.S.C. Best advice is there is dangerous situation. We shdn’t drift into it. What M/F. wants to do is to mobilise bakers’ stocks – method offer bad flour now and encourage them to use more out of stock.

J.S. Millers won’t disseminate between bakers.

P.M. Why not reduce bread rations? [Enter C.E.

J.S. Much more severe action and slower acting.

A.B. You cd. get a voluntary saving if you tried – as means of ensuring variety of diet. But even redn. in ration wd. be easier to defend than increasing extractn. rate.

A. It’s only 60.000 t. in 6 weeks. Can we not run risk of going on as now for so short a period.

P.M. x/ Why not cut releases by millers by 5% with liberty to millers on M/Food to refrain from makg. it in exceptional cases.

A.V.A. You cd. justify in H/C limiting off-take to amount [Enter T.W.

requd. to honour ration.

T.W. Repeated argument v. psycholog. effect on farmers, if extra actn. rate increased.

R.S.C. Repeated x/.

210

J.S. Record view of my advisers’ tht. it may cause dislocation and interruptn.

G.A.I. Plan a public statement. [Enter J.G., N., J.W.

6. Civil Service Man Power.

C.E. Disappointed at results.

And new bldg. now is out of ques. So, tho’ long-term benefits wd.

accrue, can’t do anything short-term.

A.B. Don’t be put on defensive by newspp. Many “C. Servants” are doing

only what they did before outside Govt. service.

40/45.000 cd. be dispensed with if we cd. abandon rationing and controls.

But when will that be?

Trend of Govt. policy involves accretions to C. Serv. wh. are not w’drawals fr. productive man power eg. C.W. Ag. Cttees. insurance societies. Also fortuitous eg. H.C.B. employees aren’t C. Servants : many under civil aviation are eg. in airports.

No regular recruitment for some time : some tempies. aren’t so good and causes wasteful use of nos.

We considered amalgamn. of M/N.I. with M/L. Man power saving cd. be made if M/L. exchange expanded to cover M/N.I. work.

But premises designed for existg. functions and can’t be expanded any more.

C. Service must be defended from accusation of ‘parasites’ – they carry out our policy. Glad P.M. so defended it in recent reply to P.Q.

We shd. deplore any Geddes or May approach – by percentage cut.

Cab. shd. be ready to defend retentn. of suff. staff to carry out Govt. policy.

P.M. Did you consider methods of work?

C.E. Yes : we had Ty. O &amp; M. repve. Before us. He explained how this is all working. And assured us that, in mechanism, C. Service now leads industry.

P.M. And what saving cd. be secured if responsibility devolved lower?

C.E. Referred to para. 22 of Rpt.

R.S.C. Only 3.500 adminve. class all told, anyway.

E.E.B. The P.M. point has substance : but devolution must come slowly because war-time recruitment. But will make a difference in speed rather than man power.

R.S.C. Size of correspondence : P.Q.’s.

211

Shortages mean waste of man power because need to ration.

Resentment among C. Servants who have worked devotedly.

P.M. I will make a statement.

R.S.C. Our C. Service is less p. head of popn. than in U.S.

H.D. I am v. disturbed and disappointed.

Greater nos + demands for more pay : less work.

a) Why no reference in Rpt. to Foreign Service? Cab. insisted on their inclusion.

E.E.B. F. Service nos. are v. small. This Rpt. is based on 23 Dpts. wh. represent 90% of numbers.

Informal enquiry now betwn. Ty. and F.O. v. size of staffs.

b) Service Dpts. Why do Cttee accept this proposed increase?

Has there been a sufficient scrutiny?

H.D. We have decided to aggregate uniformed and non uniformed now and in future.

A.V.A. Oct. 45-47 net redn. is 62.000 in 3 Service Dpts.

Cheaper to run with civil than uniformed staff.

They have bn. stringently cross examined by Cttee.

H.D. c) Regional organisations. Is para. 21. general or confined to M/H.?

H.D. d) M/N.I. and M/L. Cdnd’t there be common staff in certain areas?

Has this bn. probed?

P.M. I asked C.E. to have special enquiry made into this.

C.E. It is in hand.

A.B. Must consider divisions of functions also in Region.

P.M. The Cttee. shd. continue at work and report again to Cabinet.

I never suggested complete amalgamation.

C.E. We considered. But only 18 Exchanges at which it cd. be done. Everywhere else it wd. involve addl. premises and expansion.

J.G. We have offered to use M/L. premises wherever practicable.

Para. 10.(a). Merger of Bd. with M/N.I. raises issue of policy.

Want Bd. to be retained as independent instrument.

P.M. This can come up again. [Exit J.G.

212

7. Civil Aviation : Purchase of U.S. Types.

A. As in Report.

J.W. Not right to suppose Tudor II is unduly late or bad.

N. N. Atlantic is not the primary considn. It is Empire routes which give rise to this. S. Africa and Austr. have acquired U.S. machines and declined Tudors : so collaborations in those routes has broken down. Tudor II can’t do the work of Constellations because inadequate airports E. of Calcutta or S. of Nairobi. It wd. take 3 years to provide the required airports E. of Calcutta.

And S. Africa 3/4 years because they insist on following their long-term plan.

P.M. We put up airports quick enough in war?

N. But a) these are in territories outside our control, b) airports must conform to internatl. standards, c) we can’t take the risks R.A.F. cd. take.

Our types run at loss of £20 an hour. Only new type in view to D.H. 604 entirely novel : early 1950’s is earliest we can hope to bring it in.

Act assumed tht. subsidies wd. taper off. Now looks as tho’ they will increase. We must either curtail services or ask Parlt. to increase subsidies. At a time when other countries using Constellations are operating at a profit.

Much emphasis on damage to prestige of B. aircraft industry and not enough on damage to prestige of B. civil aviation.

Cab may have to decide which is to suffer.

But loss of civil aviation prestige will in the end inflict greater damage on aircraft industry.

Shall be headg. to posn. criticised by Cadman Rpt. Shall issue another demand for a Cadman Cttee.

H.D. Either alternative is costly. Project X will cost somethg. in dollars at once. Fr. that angle alone I must oppose it.

N.B. Air Miny. view : Project X wd. damage aircraft industry v. seriously : and finish prospects of getting orders for Tudors or Avro.

Wd. mean abandoning flying boat services – at a time when it becomes popular.

Range was as specified. Flying boats can do the long hop : popular : B. Speciality. Believe our aircraft can operate these routes, even at some loss, until our new types come in early in ‘50’.

A.V.A. Danger tht. we may lose the traffic : and when our types come in have impossible arrears to overtake.

Memo. approved.
