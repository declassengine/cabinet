C.M. 10(47) 21st January 1947

1. Deserters.

A.V.A. Raised in H/C. P.M.’s corrce. with Wyatt. M.P.

2 P.Q.s for tomorrow. Serv. Ministers and Home Secy. have discussed with me. H.M. also concerned.

H.O. estimate : no. deserters indicted in Met P.D. = about 8% of all convictions.

18.000 deserters then : so that conn. to crime by deserters must be large.

C.E. 1/12th convns. of indict. crime in Ldn. is covered. by whatever propn. of deserters is in Ldn. And even 18.000, still more Ldn’s share of it, is small fraction of 45m.

A.V.A. Feeling in H/C divided. Some = amnesty : some = inducements to come fwd. by promising leniency. Diffy. repercussions on men serving loyally : and effect on future reliance on comp. service. Our feeling therefore is against amnesty.

Statement : paras c. and d. represents max. safe inducement.

May be said this isn’t much – gratuity.

If we went further others might think it wd. pay to go on the run.

Current desertion = 700 a month Army. Mustn’t encourage that.

R.S.C. Para c) limiting date, surrender by specified time. Wd. expedite surrender.

Wd. also be embarrassing to have to close it later.

F.J.B. Agreed.

R.S.C. Say 31st March – Agreed.

C.I.G.S. 700 a month : recovering 800 a month.

1% of intake : quite illiterate.

30% “ “ semi illiterate.

Army takes 70% of total intake.

Believe it will slow down in peace years.

C.E. Para d) “full civil rights” has some meaning abroad tho’ not here.

“resumption of his full status as a member civil community”. Agreed:

Unless even simpler language be found. M/D. and H.O.

P.M. Does a deserter ever lose his gratuity?

A.V.A. Can restore his position by subs. service.

C.N.S. Unless convicted of desertion.

P.M. This shd. be considered.

63

R.S.C. Para c) what do you want employers to do? Say exactly what you want, or omit.

A.B. Omit final sentence of para e). Agreed:

Agreed : subject to points noted.

2. Defence Estimates. [Enter Wilmot

A.V.A. Def. Cttee have vetted : Cab. considered man-power on Econ. Survey.

Wd. have liked a long-term policy. But 47/48 is still a transitional year.

Takg. a/c of savings fr. redn. in commitmt. on signing of P. Treaties, there is still much terminal cost. Broad picture : 46/47 £1.667.000 (576.) £1.091.000 net.

£1.063.00 (£150 m terminal) as submd. to me in first instance.

Felt we shd. make much effort to reduce. Series of mtgs. with C.S. and then Ministers. Second reductn. of £122.5m. Of this £30 m. redn. in terminals. Now £118 m.

Now £822 m. as cpd. with £1.091 m. in 46/47 – excludg. terminals.

A.B. What wd. be cost if these Services had to be supplied fr. current prodn.

A.V.A. Meetg. 50% of requiremts. from stocks.

A.B. Then critics will say we are retaining impossibly high Forces.

A.V.A. Estimate includes £21 m. under Supply wh. = civil expenditure (atomic energy and civil aviation research). Also Col. Defence. Polish Forces and Ital. Colonies are all on W.O. Votes. That amounts to £42 m.

Same propn. of Ital. Re-settlement Corps may help W.

Even so, £785 m.

P.M. But Forces are not yet down to peace-time level. Can’t yet see permanent relations betwn. Forces and supply.

A.V.A. Wd. keep in mind a) saving fr. f. policy : but b) run-down before 1.1.49. and problem of retaing. some efficient units m’while. Heavy financial cut cdn’t be secured w’out heavy man-power cut, which wd. prejudice efficiency, particularly in training.

Service Ministers to answer detailed criticism.

N.B. RA.F. services to civil aviation – may be worth about £10 m.

A.B. Any estimate to prev. Govt. of post-war expenditure made by Services.

P.M. No : a guess, when Service pay and value of money was different.

H.D. £500 m. was K.W.’s guess.

64

Then added by U.S.C. and O.L. tht. this was more than country can afford.

J. J.A. asserted tht. we cdn’t carry £500 m.

A.B. What is the extra provision for?

A.V.A This is a transitional year.

E.Sh. Asked for informn. re. bldg. H. gave it.

N.B. Gave particulars of current prodn. of aircraft. Mainly jets : a) will give no better defence with small nos. b) may need smaller force for engine maintenance. Other big item : Hastings : capable of commercial use as Hermes.

C.A.S. Switching off Yorks because no use for troop lift.

N.B. Hastings is more economical for York range.

E.Sh. Tanks : enough to keep 2 factories going. Cdn’t this be cut.

A.V.A. 240 to keep it going. this year selling 180 to India.

C.I.G.S. At this rate wd. take 15/20 yrs. to equip Reg. Army with 50% reserve and to give handful to Territorials.

E.Sh. Nos. empld.?

J.W. About 300. Doesn’t include engine manufacture.

E.Sh. This is only for hull and assembly.

Wdn’t it be better to produce smaller no. p.a. because of changing design etc.

R.S.C. Must m’tain continuity of tank prodn. Must have at least 2 factories to get play of ideas.

J.W. And 10 a month is minimum to keep factories going.

C.I.G.S. Improved Centurion (60th) is almost as good as Stalin.

R.S.C. Sorry r &amp; dev. is so small propn. of total. This is v. small, when scope is so great for improved technique in R.A.F. etc.

A.V.A. Here is a field for exploration this year. We must have long term policy on balance of expenditure. Prest. p’mme of r. &amp; d. may be too much a continn. of existg. work. H. Tizard only just arrived : must have time to look into posn. If we find we can do all we need with this absolute expendre. in future yrs. total cost drops, then propn. will be higher.

65

A. Relation is primarily with supply expenditure, not total Defence expenditure. So related, it’s not so small a figure.

A.V.A. R and d. in Defence doesn’t, as in civil industry, reduced costs. It merely increases the Forces’ tail, and adds to cost.

N.B. £60m for r. &amp; d. is v. high in relation to nos of skilled scientific workers.

A.V.A. Involve 46.000 man power.

R.S.C. What propn. will be spent on research in Universities?

P.M. Large items for works and lands. What for?

F.J.B. Modernisation. Burma, Malay and Singapore : £7.4 m.

H.D. How much for Burma? Must be able to set it off in Burma settlement.

P.M. At large, are they condns. for troops or w/defence which might be p’poned.

F.J.B. £10.75 m. at home for m’tenance and improvements.

New bldg. is mainly for housing.

A.V.A. Improvemt. of condns. is v. import. for recruiting.

Cut already from £29 to 20 m.

Barracks (R.N. and Army) are in shocking state. Men must see some pract. promise of improvement. R.A.F. much tempy. accomn.

A.B. V. large expendre. in single year. £99 m total. Can you spend it?

F.J.B. We have got larger allocn. of bldg. labour. And much is overseas.

In Malaya condns. wh. produced mutiny are common .

A.V.A. Results of Govt. Policy – eg. Canal Zone.

A.B. And in U.K. much of this wd. otherwise have to be spent in civil housing.

N.B. £3½ m. for techn. work : hangars, control bldgs. repair of runways etc.

A. Propn. of expre. at home. Cd. we have some figures : might help to meet criticism from amenity men – if, as I gather, propn. is small.

F.J.B. £1.8 m. for land. No provn. for new bldgs in training areas.

A.V.A. My informn. ( 9.37 m. at home : 1.25 may not be spent.

(1.825 m. for land.

66

Total of Army expend. at home is under £10 m.

H. R.N. £6 m. Because of blitz at Portsmouth and Plymouth. 2 m. on repairs.

2m. on m. quarters. Only ½ m. on land.

E.Sh. Has M/D. considered wthr. these items, or any, can be delayed?

A.V.A. Yes : but a) improved condns. includg. m. quarters.

b) repair of shockg. barracks. eg Plymouth because of blitz.

c) land : buying it to preserve bldgs. erected already.

P.M. £55 m movements. What for?

F.J.B. 300.000 to be released : moved home. Some in and others out.

Overseas leave. Reorganisation involves moving about.

This is abnormal year.

A.V.A. True of Army. R.N. at £4 m. is near normal. R.A.F. approachg. normality.

F.J.B. Because R.N. and R.A.F. are much nearer peace time size.

P.M. Can we have figures in more comparable form in future years – for 3 Services.

H.D. Concerned at total. Too big for Budget : for our economic posn. Puts too much strain on our economy.

Told M/D. before Xmas we used to regard 500 m. as maximum, as 18 months since war ended it will be diff. to defend much more than 750 to taxpayer. Repeated that in Def. Cttee. Concln. (2). I had a bargaining margin in mind. On concln. (2) I had hoped for a deal between 750 and 963., perhaps 850. We have scraped off only 22.9 m – mainly by transferring it to this year.

Last year : Cab. said 10% cut on non-terminals. Serv. Ministers reserved need for Supplementaries. Believed in total they cd. take the 10%. I was right. Gross 1667. The plus and minus have come out level. R.A.F. saved £20 m. over the cut; and M/S. £50 m. R.N. have needed £25m more (out of £36 m : 10%). Army need £45 m. (out of 57 m).

Thus, we break even : and we secure the 10% cut in total.

Now, therefore, I propose overall cut of 10% includg. terminals. £82m.

Ready, as last year, to consider Supplementaries in course of year.

But if we cd. achieve it, £82 m. less will make all the diffce. in ???? and in tax reduction.

Distribution of the £82 m. I leave to M/Defence.

I have a hunch there is scope for economies. This wd. force them out. Follows successful precedent – at a time when more than ever important.

67

A.V.A. a) our private talk, with H.D. I had discussed 1.063 m. gross with Services and told them it was too high. Said I aimed at 750 net. They tried to get down to that. They cdn’t. move discns. and we reached in the end 822.

b) “Follow precedent”. Not at all. This is first time we have had any intermediate action betwn. Services and Ty. My experience as Service Minister – shows it all depends on his initial action. Last year at Admy. I cut £35 m. myself : I was shocked at 10% subsequent cut : and you have had to meet a Supplementary.

P.M. And don’t overlook Directive re living on stocks and my subsequent (Plant) enquiry.

A.V.A. We play the game with Ty. We shall save every £1 we can. We have anticipated Ty. 10% by deducting an 8% shortfall.

V. diff. posn. today re. run-down and planning of Forces. we then had many trained men and hoped for re-enlistment of volunteers. Now we face 700.000 men to go from Army by 1.1.49. Further cut cd. be met only by releasing more trained men still – and shall have no efficient units.

We have anticipated, by new method, the Ty. 10%.

If this is cut, I can’t tell Parlt. this provision will meet my commitments.

H.D. Cut was taken as 10% on each Estimate last year.

This time, I don’t say how it shd. be done. All I say is: we can’t afford this total by 10%. And wd. sooner it came back in supplementaries.

A.V.A. Service Ministers must impose the cut in detail, however.

A.B. Some tolerance surely.

A.V.A. I’ve cut it already. Where is the further cut to fall – accommn. training etc.

H.D. Net redn. is only fr. £1091. to £822 from 1st to 2nd year of peace.

Not v. much.

E.Sh. Parlt. criticism : more likely to be that we are spending too much,.

A.B. Comparison with 38/39?

A.V.A. Not comparison of like with like.

P.M. Where is the further cut to go?

A.V.A. Not w’out interference with personnel side. And wd. reduce operational units to point below meetg. commitments.

68

A. Some big items mentioned this a.m. Annex A.

A.V.A. Still affect personnel – eg works and bldgs.

E.Sh. Run-down.

J.S. W. Paper today will create alarm over econ. posn. Rightly. Against that b’ground then Estimates will be presented. Can we justify devotg. this propn. of our resources to Defence while we call, as we must, for greater civil effort in industry etc. £1.000 m. 18 mos. after end/war. is too much to ask, in climate of economic position.

A.V.A. Cab. haven’t seen W.P.

Task of Services is to do their duty to all with policy of Govt. It is that policy wh. requires us to meet the commitments: and to face consequence of their release plan.

Can you ask them to be efficient with 10% less

A.B. Same as other Dpts. What of economies I have had to make in houses because of genl. economic situation. Reasonable to ask Services to apply their ingenuity to achievg. this economy.

Efficiency of Forces depends on state of feeling in the country.

Believe H.D.’s view shd. be accepted.

But remember Supplies must be justified otherwise than on grds. of faulty estimating.

R.S.C. Pace A.V.A. it is also poss. for Cab. to say that overall you can’t afford more than x. Services must do their best with resources that can be spared for them. Resources must fit policy, to some extent.

H.D. Some cuts are being applied elsewhere.

E.W. Effect on income tax?

H.D. About 9/= on standard rate, theoretically.

A.V.A. I’ve made my cut already.

We must hold our position in the world. India won’t be available.

H.D. I only ask that something be left to hope, efficiency and experience during the year. Take off £80 m. If any Service makes a case for getting some (even all) of it back, I will agree to Supplementaries.

P.M. We may be trying a f. policy wh. we can’t carry out.

But given that f. policy we must enforce it.

R.S.C. E.B. wants exports too. Can’t have both. This p’pones his chance of getting other cards in his hand.

69

Agreed : Defer decision. A.V.A. to consider means and effect of taking 10% cut.

3. Maritime Consultation Organisation. Approved.

4. International Labour Organisation. Approved.
