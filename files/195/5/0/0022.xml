C.M. 22(47) 14th February 1947

1. Coal.

P.M. a) ‘B.B.C.’ suggest appeals fr. industry (both sides) and Churches for unity. T.U.C. and F.B.I. General feeling : against this. (Coalition!)

b) Broadcasting. Shd. it be stopped at source? From 9-12 &amp;2-4.

E.Sh. A large load. B.B.C. and P.M.G. favour it.

c) Unemployment Benefit

General feeling : in favour of suspension.

.

J.G. Tewson’s lr. wasn’t clear. We considered this for the emplt. and

injuries Acts – shdn’t disturb that rule. Propose use my power to bring

new rule into opn. as fr. Monday last. Waiving the rule wd. prejudice

???? factors.

Favour this course.

P.M. Must be out for 12 days.

R.S.C. They will!

E.Sh. Not in all districts.

Agreed : introduce new rule, as proposed by J.G. [Exit J.G.

d) Message from Truman

H.D. 750.000 for every 1 m. But lots of money in Fund.

.

E.B. Thank him. But trouble if we divert because Europe is in worse condn.

H.D. Agree : dollars.

Thank : but no action. [Enter C.O.S. and N.B.

2. Palestine. Must suppress terrorists – maybe by nil. action. But another try at coopn.

by Agency, to avoid a Mil. Adminn. [Enter P.L.

because Jews insist on pre-condn. tht. we agree to J. State and tht.

immigrn. is not to relieve distress in Europe, but to build a J. majority

in Pal. if not in whole then in part of Pal.

E.Sh. See no alternative. But long wait until Sept. Cd. we alleviate immigrn. posn. – diffies. in Cyprus. Wd. strengthen moderates and Agency.

While immigrn. is important, we can’t deal with it [Exit E.Sh.

125

What part? J. have shown no concern over what is to happen, until we said last

night we must go to U.N.

Responsibility of U.S. Jewry.

B. Jews urge us to negotiate on basis of our last plan. But we can’t because Agency won’t discuss on that basis and they won’t throw over Agency.

Tried to get U.S. in : Anglo U.S. Enquiry : offered to stand by whole Rpt. but U.S. wdn’t. P.A. Plan went as far as that Rpt : they wdn’t support that. Then tried to get 3 party conference : Arabs came in and were not so hostile, might have taken some alternative scheme to their own. But Jews wdn’t come in unless as accepted in advance a J. State. Many informal mtgs. with Jews. Tried the formula “transition period”. Weizmann favoured this approach. No gt. Arab hostility to that idea. Hoped it wd. enable us to solve immigration ques. – to extent of 100.000. Wd. have relieved pressure. Also thought J. wd. welcome ec. absorp

capacity plus appeal to arbitration. But that is made a grievance, as

method of obstructing immigration.

We showed J. a map. J. produced their Partition map. Know now their

claim is impossible.

Believe J. think we are bluffing. Think they can press us by terrorism

etc.

Then came Truman’s statement on Day of Atonement. Weizmann cdn’t hold the Jews in Paris as result of that. And Arabs in Paris said we were yielding to U.S. pressure.

After resumption of Confce. in Jan. atmosphere has bn. more difficult. The Arabs had come together more firmly because terrorism etc.

We put up new scheme. Expected A. to reject it : was propd. to press them to acquiesce. But Jews rejected it out of hand, even as a basis for discussion. Had hoped we might get the 5 year period and C.A. : the immigrn. proposals.

After we told them we wd. go to U.N. there has bn. much running after us. They now want a modus vivendi in interim period. Tried to find out wthr. A. wd. agree. Said 1.500 a month wd. continue : they were hostile to any increase. M’while J. ask us to revert to pre ’39 adminn. of Mandate. Figures of immigration pre war. Peak in ’37 caused A. revolt. Reduced thereafter. Now putting in 21.000 p.a.

P.M. Shd. go to U.N.

126

Diffy is waiting until Sept.

Earlier mtg?

H.D. Trusteeship C.?

C.J. Can’t act until there is a Trust Agreement.

R.S.C. Cd. Secy. Genl. start an enquiry.

E.B. Am considering that. May

E.B. Must get Moscow over first. That means mid Apl. Then D.O. wants confce. on Germany : can’t ignore interest of belligerents. Must be between Moscow : September. No one else cares about Palestine. R. wd. veto it as like as not.

bring it to Sec. Council. however : can’t risk

that.

Neither side wants to go to U.N. May be this will create a new

situation in wh. talks will be poss. Also new attitude by U.S. – last

thing they want esp. if we go w’out a recommn. Want to put them in a

posn. to take a line : some responsibility. Pressure on State Dept. to get

it re-opened with A. and J. U.S. may put up a scheme.

J. Interview with Simon Marks : B. Gurion. Askg. us to continue – no

early pressure for solution. Concession : a) 100.000 in 2 years.

Thereafter on ec. absorpt. capacity will leave it to H. Comms – if

principle is first established. Given that, I can stop terrorism with coopn.

of whole J. community. Might be able then to reduce extent of

illegal immigration. b) J. right to buy land and settle anywhere in

Palestine.

A.V.A. Para. 8 of memo.

Ques. is how long before you have to put in a Mil. Adminn. What will

be effect on morale troops if we put it to U.N.? &amp; and appear to be

turning it over to U.N. Situation may be dangerous.

E.B. Cd. U.N. start an enquiry?

N.B. Fear not, when U.N. is not in Session.

But both sides are alarmed now at having to defend their action in U.N.

Appeal by President of U.N. might have great effect – for peace in

interim.

Sec. Genl. cd. begin assembling material. Some signs of prepn. cd. be

given.

Believe we shd. get near to 2/3rds (36 : 19) for our latest plan if we got

U.S. support. But some increased immigrn. m’while wd. help to get

U.S. support : appeal v. terrorists.

P.M. Will J. adopt policy of despair or avoiding prejudicing case in U.N.?

Genl. view : second course.

127

C.J. Situatn. beyond B. Gurion’s control.

Civil adminn. can’t be carried on, as now. Will break down. Will have

to have Mil. Adminn. w’in the 6 months.

J.S. This = hanging on as now indefinitely. Will a U.N. resoln. change the

position. Shall have to go on with guerrilla war indefinitely.

I believe J. case is right. Unilateral decision in their favour wd. change

atmosphere.

P.M. Why assume we continue after U.N.?

C.E. Who will enforce a U.N. decision?

P.M. We cd. refuse to, if asked.

E.B. Wdn’t take it on unless there were agreed solutions.

A.V.A. Likely outcome : collective Trusteeship, letting R. in.

Have A. and J. realised this?

Staff Confce. 13/1 decided Pal. was vital strategic necessity to us.

C.A.S. a) Short term. Our troops are under gt. strain with def. object of

retaining Mandate. In interim period we shan’t have a definite object.

That involves a gt. risk.

b) Long term : M/E. vital to security eg. Commonwealth includg. U.N.

if we come out of Pal. because U.N. discn. produces nothg. satisf. the

lynch-pin of our security is pulled out.

J.S. Alternative : revert to pre 1939 Mandate.

P.M. And an Arab revolt. Hostile Arab world and prs. Muslim world.

What is use of Pal. in midst of a hostile Arab world?

A.V.A. Arabs wd. then take us to U.N. and get R. support there.

Also what of oil problem.

C.E. And, after terrorism, public opinion at home and among the troops.

E.B. If we are going to U.N. better to go there on our own initiative.

Egypt are now drawing back fr. U.N. Arab world pressing E. to settle.

C.A.S. Not merely Arabs in Pal. but whole Muslim world. Egypt : oil in Iraq and Arabia : India. From Gib. to Singapore.

H.D. Favour submn. to U.N. w’out recommn.

But still believe Partition is best solution for us, and for peace in Palestine.

We are not going to argue v. that in U.N? 128

E.B. No.

Then still believe it best for a) peace b) strategic interests.

E.B. No.

E.B. If we decide : announce, they may come round.

R.S.C. But try for some U.N. movement before September.

A. Inform Doms. Wait until Wed.

P.M. Tuesday.

A.V.A. Welfare of troops in Pal. No perm. bldg. Another 6 mos. Shall have

pressure over this.

That door is not shut

E.B. Will try.

P.M. Immigrn. stand pat. If you yield at all they will demand more and more.

E.B. Want to communicate with A. States and U.S.
