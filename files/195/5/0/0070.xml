C.M. 92 (47) 2nd December, 1947 1.

Parliament Bill Read letter to Jowitt.

Common sense view is that Speaker wd. find a way of giving his cert.

P.M. Agreed: and less said about it the better.

A. Salisbury has said to me – the 12 mos. in Bill is not a year of Parly.

time. e.g. Transport Bill not recd in H/L until July (?)

This indicates tht. H/L opposn don’t want to throw Bill out.

They are feeling their way towards an excuse to pass it.

This is argument for not incldg. amendment on H.M.’s point.

A.B. Recess is

H.M. Have consulted Home Secretary &amp; S.G.

Recommended Cabinet to take the risk.

If a final difference on it, counting Recess etc. then wd. have been only 3 mos. Parly. time out of the 12 mos from 2nd Rdg. in H/C. time available for composing differences.

C.E. We can cure trouble in last Session by proroguing one month after H/L

have received it. Then hold another Session in which Spker can

give his certificate.

Agreed: Do nothing &amp; don’t talk about it.

A.B. Worried – in general. But, leave it alone.

[Exit W.W.

2. Economic Affairs.

Production &amp; Stocks

R.S.C. Para. 8. Increasg. improvement. 14.4m average for Oct.

Wool tops = remarkable rise Aug. – Oct. Figures given.

Stocks. Coal 16.7m vice 15m target. Made export poss.

Started with bunkers saving ½ m. p. wk.

Next: catch cargoes e.g. to Eire = totalling 30.000 t. p. wk. to countries with wh. we have made trade agreemts. Scrap &amp; pig iron. V. serious. Turns on settlement of Anglo. U.S.

zone. E.B. has done all he can.

E.B. Cd. you buy more scrap from S. Italy?

P.M. Home scrap?

R.S.C. Will enquire.

374

R.S.C. Yes = Cttee has explored &amp; that shd. go ahead faster now.

A.B. Under-water cutting?

R.S.C. Yes.

R.S.C. Overseas posn. V. serious indeed – worsening. Para. 13 figures 53.4 vice 61 in Sept. Apart from this steadily

increasg. deteriorn.

And as prices of imports rise, we are told our export prices are

too high – cf. for Canada.

$4.80 in Argentine.

A.V.A. Who can afford these prices?

Para. 15. Prices. Free markets now v. small therefore bulk purchases &amp; sensitivies. Yet taken as index for deals e.g. Chicago Wheat Market. Australian wheat contract concluded at over 2 per ???? as cpd. with 1.55 for Canada – Chicago price over 3. cf. also Danish butter.

Canadian negotns will come out badly for us.

P.M. What is answer about markets?

R.S.C. None: until we get more goods on the market.

H.W. It’s worse. Chicago price is lower than some free markets.

R.S.C. They are v. small quantities offered &amp; bought.

Diffy. is not bulk purchase: it is sticking to idea of world market price vice costing (!) R.S.C. Not as much need as for food. And U.S. can undercut us on consumer

goods &amp; capital goods.

A.B. Doesn’t world want our goods?

A.W. How can they pay U.S.?

R.S.C. Don’t yet know how they will pay. Shd. have a better entry into those markets. A.B. Only short-term remedy is for us to push what people want.

Drain on Reserves.

Can we look again at coal?

R.S.C. We are doing that. Shan’t increase stocks. And in Jan. shall be able to run them down.

Nov. 57.3. Going worse than thought.

New adverse factors

About 1/3rd sterling area: 2/3rds U.K. 375

a) Germany: prob $40m.

b) Canada: prob. up to £100m. in dollars additional liability viz 158 instead of 58.

c) Belgium &amp; pos. Sweden: we are havg. to pay under gold clauses.

This will make it even more diff. to get to £25m.

We think it wd. be unwise to fall below gold reserve of £500m.

By end /47 (with Can. dollars) we shd. have £440m, all told, in gold &amp;

dollars. Drawing at present rate wd. bring us below 500 early in

’48. Average of 34m. p. wk. (vice 55 as now) wd. last to June

’48. Rate of 44m. to end May’48. This assumes £180m assets fr.

S. Afr. Loan &amp; unfreezing of U.S. Loan.

Outlook for 1948 is v. grave therefore and getting worse.

H.M. Glad this informn circulated.

What happened?

R.S.C. Stats. were imperfectly kept. H.W. has suggd improvements.

H.W. Reported on 20/9 to H.D. Thought he was going to send it to H.M. &amp;

A.B.

Also rest of sterling area v. slow.

Might shake confidence &amp; produce a run.

Sterling and drawings – another uncertainty. India &amp; Pakistan (esp. former) may spend quantities of dollars in S. America for food, under pressure of famine.

Earlier, A.B. &amp; I. thght. Ty. &amp; B/E stats. weren’t adequate.

R.S.C. I will do that.

H.W. Surprised how much guesswork there was. Cdn’t recommend many short-term changes.

Now rate of drain is quickly ascertained. But where money is going can’t be ascertained quickly. H.D. was going to ask Serv. Dpts. to improve.

R.S.C. Now apptd liaison cttee with them. Hope it will work out better.

E.B. Liaison with Service Dpts? Can’t find out whr. they are spending wisely.

Scope for economy. Continuing check needed vice old Ty. control. Want a new attitude by C-in-C’s overseas.

R.S.C. I will consider this.

Publicity.

A.B. a) Shd. we not have sustained publicity re movement of world food prices – to show this isn’t indigenous. Cd. B.B.C. give them regularly? 376

R.S.C. Not the bi-lateral agreement prices.

A.B. b) Propaganda in food-producing countries? E.B. The Govts. may be sympathetic: but you wd. raise feelings of farmers

behind them. E.g. in N.Z.

R.S.C. Not so easy – e.g Austr. Wheat Bd. regud by legal decns to sell wheat at a fair price.

E.B. This is temporary. Danger of running up other costs to an extent which keeps prices up. E.g. in U.S. the talk has put wages up by 20%.

R.S.C. Also you will tend to make other countries to demand equally high prices.

A.B. Selective publicity answers that. Don’t advertise Danish prices in N.Z.

Truman’s efforts have not checked the rise.

R.S.C. We can put the terms of trade = our export prices &amp; import costs.

P.M. Remember Govts. of N.Z. &amp; Austr. depend on urban votes.

Don’t arm selfish sections in rural areas.

N.B. Same is true in Canada.

General Concln.

This needs thought. {R.S.C. to consult with E.B.,

Grounds for some measure of optimism.

A.B., H.M., N.B.

A.W. Germany: cdn’t our Forces live on the country?

Engineering division to export.

R.S.C. My figures assume this.

A.B. India &amp; Pakistan.

c) Shdn’t we get India to mobilise their gold reserves? They cd. do quite a bit that way.

N.B. Our Financial Delegn will raise that. Also drawg. on I.M.F. Also loans for capital projects.

Food prospects better than thought.

A.B. Can’t we have a report on that?

It’s not a financial operation. It’s political &amp; religious.

Prices &amp; Finance.

R.S.C. Marked fall in Govt. securities. No precise reason assigned.

Reduction in no. of notes in circulation. Unexplained.

377

A.B. Ought we not to consider a new issue – to catch hot money.

R.S.C. Haven’t rejected that.

Improvemt. in rate of National Savings. Gave figures.

Odd that this came simultaneously with note issue change.

A.W. Cd. R.S.C. advise people on best method of Nat. Savings viz. which type of investment.

Transport.

R.S.C. Congrats. to rlways for improvemt. in turn-round of wagons.

Good if P.M. wd. refer to that.

N.B. New wagons carry more. This isn’t brght out in Memo.

A. Wagons under repair.

R.S.C. Asked Percy Mills to go into this = it’s now moving.

A.B. 1944 Group of friendly business men – incldg. Geo. Dixon of

Wingates.

Much capacity for wagon repair in private firms. Val Critall says if Reg. Bds. had the duty of organising this they cd. do much.

R.S.C. Idea of this has bn. put to Percy Mills.

Form of Documents. R.S.C. They have bn. given 20% &amp; 10% respectively.

Man Power

H.M. a) No mention of Agriculture or Food. Their part in the Plan shd. be covered in future issues.

b) Targets. Cd. we see performance against approved targets.

R.S.C. Thinking of that: but they are 1948 targets.

H.M. c) Cd. some more targets be evolved? Cotton &amp; wool e.g.

G.T. That won’t do as incentive to various parts of cotton etc. Shd. concentrate on yarn end: to ensure continuity of supplies to finishing end.

From June/Sept. 50.000 fr. munitions.

G.A.I. 194.000 addl. on exports cpd. mid/1939.

We believe 74% rise in total labour force on exports.

Shd. be able to hit mid ’49 target with no more increase in labour. M/L shd. agree on this with Planners. 378

Para. 3. Net loss turned to balance in 1st wks of Nov. and slight net gain in 3rd week (850).

Cotton spinning: figures are looking much better.

9.000 brought into textiles since C/Engagemt. Order.

Cotton: overtime = Union is not co-operative. Must keep pressure up on this.

G.T. Esp. as these are car-room workers – at beginning end of industry.

Publicity (resumed).

A.B. “Work or Want”. In 1948 (early) we can talk of progress in 1947. Can’t we use ???? -types for this?

Move over from threats to performance.

R.S.C. This is being done in Reports to the Nation.

H.M. “Work or Want.” campaign is off. New line is more positive.

[R.S.C. invited H.M. to look into this one.]

3.

Japan: Peace Treaty.

E.B. Summarised earlier suggns.

Now Molotov’s suggn of C.F.M. in Jan ’48 in China.

Propose we stand by Canberra rules.

Argument re past. At Yalta R. wasn’t in Jap. war. But secret agreemt. between F.D.R. &amp; Stalin, later signed by W.S.C. But no record of C.F.M. being given authy to settle peace with Japan.

This means a definite break with R. over F/East.

Alarmed, however, at inconstancy of U.S.A.

Agreed: Adhere to Canberra Rules.

4.

Civil List: Provision for H.R.H. Princess Elizabeth &amp; Duke of Edinburgh.

R.S.C. Now E. has 15,000 &amp; P. nil.

50.000 p.a. requd to m’tain right standard.

Propose 10.000 for P. another 15.000 for E. And get contribn of 100.000 from H.M. which wd. carry the provn for E. for 7 years.

May I try to get that accepted by Select Cttee?

A.B. Present it mainly as cost of household – expense allowance.

R.S.C. 9/10ths is tax free.

379

5.

India.

Turn for the better. 3 day’s cordial discn to be resumed Labour 6/12.

Refugee settlement in Punjab going better also.
