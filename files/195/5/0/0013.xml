C.M. 13(47) 28th January 1947

1. Defence Estimates.

A.V.A. Have carried out examn. for wh. Cab. asked.

Want £21 m. off, for M/Supply civil expenditure.

Any 10% cut imposed now wd. be additional to cuts I have imposed – first time M/D. has examined in detail with co-opn. of 3 Services. Can’t have Ty. putting arbitrary cut on top of that year by year.

This is abnormal year. The last before we get Estimates based on long- term plan.

My £92 m. reduction on original estimates is more than 10% on variable items because so much is unalterable. eg. account, maintenance, non-effective services. Another 10% general means another 25% off some of more vital services.

Admy. 19½ m. W.O. 36 m. Air 20½ m. M/S. 4 m. This = 10% addl. cut. For Admy. this wd. mean heavy cut in no. 16.000 uniformed : 6.000 more.

Paying off aircraft carriers e. of Suez : all subs. in Med. Dilute reduced complements : scrap C.O. provn. for Brigade lift : cut training by closing more establishmts. stop naval bldg : reduce various bases abroad to care and maintce. : 3½-4.000 redn. in dockyard staffs.

For W.O. As in note of mtg. with Service Ministers. After drastic cuts, there wd. still have to be reduction in nos. – 100.000 at 31.3.48. Wd. add 7 m. to terminal cost. Planning already for shortfall of 87.000. Wd. have therefore to abandon certain commitments.

[Exit C.E.

For R.A.F. cut m. quarters and improved amenities and new aircraft. This wd. give only a third : rest wd. have to come fr. reduction of nos. That wd. involve scrapping one Home Command.

A.B. Why 10% on each?

A.V.A. My cuts were on basis of discrimination. Can’t do more that way. Anything further must be even all round. Further discrimination can be made only after formulation of long-term policy. Can’t guess at that now.

For M/Supply : wd. mean cut in v. rd. expenditure, by eliminating or delaying projects.

Thus, any earlier pruning of Estimates means tht. further percentage cut cd. not be made w’out serious consequences to efficiency : welfare of Forces. Read more fr. conclusions of his mtg.

This cut cdn’t be made consistently with Cab. decision of 17th Jan.

P.M. Why select for pay-off aircraft carriers e. of Suez.

C.N.S. 2 at home can’t be paid off because training. 2 abroad must go. For nos. of men won’t permit us to have ships so far away.

76

A.B. Then all nations with Forces less than ours are wasting their expenditure viz all countries save U.S.A.

A. 82 m. for bldg = largest Admy. item.

A.V.A. Covers all bldg : repairs at home and overseas.

H. 13 m. is on ships wh. it wd. be uneconomical to scrap.

H.D. Cd. you hold it over for a year. Wd. that be wasteful?

A.V.A. Same as in completn. of contracts in priv. yards and occupy berths. Wd. be wasteful of berths.

In own yards – little at Plymouth and Chatham. Have already slowed down to maximum.

Further action wd. mean discharging men.

E.Sh. Some large ships cd. be spread over w’out wasteful use of berths.

In later years you will scale down expenditure why not keep some back for later.

A.V.A. Done that already.

C.N.S. Have already slowed down new bldg. Private firms saying already berths are wanted.

Have moored some out eg. to Ganloch. Can’t slow those on ships. We’ve done as much as we can in that way.

New aircraft coming in. If we slow carriers more, we shan’t be able to operate new types.

P.M. What is cost of keeping up repairing bases abroad?

C.N.S. Have considered closing of 3 overseas yards. Long term : Gib. wd. save 258.000 only in first year.

H. Can’t give the figure.

A.B. What man-power saving from the 10% cut.

A.V.A. 22.000 + 100.000 + 85,000 = 207.000.

E.Sh. Will you be able to spend £12 m. on naval aircraft requirements.

J.W. Cut already made on a/c of non-fulfilment.

A.V.A. P’ponement until later : will often interfere with M/S. p’mme.

J.W. Effect on war potential. Some types of cut wd. put out of all work some firms eg. Short’s – or break up design teams.

77

P.M. W.O. Cut of 100.000 men : over and above savings on accomn.

F.J.B. Wd. give largest saving – if commitments were abandoned.

A.V.A. Total savings in man-power.

Previous: 182.000 } 166.000 )

590.000 } 490.000 } 886.000

230.000 )

A.B. And add savings on civilian labour eg. bldg. labour.

A.V.A. Yes: but can’t estimate that until you can gauge effect of cuts on p’mmes. My guess wd. be 350.000 on M/S. wd. fall to about 410.000.

R.S.C. You wdn’t have to cut research. The drop wd. come automatically.

R.A.F. 7% of the cut must go on man-power. But why does that mean 28% cut in personnel? You can take credit for similar cuts in stores etc – must decrease costs all round.

A.V.A. Services must consider each item separately : can’t assume 10% on each.

F.J.B. Cut in personnel doesn’t affect all items equally.

We are aiming at peace-time Army. Works eg. needed wthr. Army is smaller or not next year.

P.M. Overheads : barracks etc. are related, not to present but to ultimate size of the Force.

R.S.C. But A.V. has said tht. kind of expenditure will go anyhow.

N.B. The figure of 85.000 is illustration only. Consequentials wd. depend on which personnel you cd. cut. If air-crew larger. Thus can’t yet say what actual personnel cut wd. have to be.

[Exit A.B.

P.M. Then you haven’t taken credit for the consequentials?

F.J.B. Estimated on basis of £275 a head – total cost. Effects on works, weapons etc. have not bn. taken into a/c.

A. New weapons for ???? eg. aren’t affected.

P.M. What proportn. is on demobilisation?

F.J.B. Can’t say. But 300.000 have to be released during year.

E.B. Diffy = disentangle fag-end end of war and cost of new Forces.

Can you avoid that this year? 78

We face a v. serious situation in Germany. [Enter C.E.

Just ask that Army shall not be cut.

Admy. shipbldg – much of it is running out expenditure, end/war.

Said R.A.F. wd. be more important than Army in future – but not for our immediate tasks in Germany and Palestine.

Cd. the Estimates distinguish between end/war costs and new Forces costs?

Before presentn. to Parlt.

The figure of 500 m. wasn’t to come in until after end/war period.

Can’t even tell fr. these figures.

P.M. Gave informn. about 500 m. figure – from my brief. Pay at 1942 rates.

E.B. And what is national income – as cpd. with estimate of 1943.

H.D. My duty is to say what this means for U.K. finances.

940 m. (20 m. civilian) – to be found fr. taxation or deficit financing.

Guess other needs + get total of 3.000 m. Defence asks for nearly one third. And this in a year which will at end be 3 years after V.E. Day.

P.M. Nearer a quarter. For you can’t count terminals (118 m.) as for defence of U.K.

H.D. I have to find the money, anyhow.

Asked M/D. to cut £80 off the net. This wd. leave 860 including terminals. Had originally thought 750. The 860 is less than ½ way down to my figure.

Have asked for 80 m. off total – haven’t specified items or even equal cuts on each Service : Supply. Have asked for it to give Budget benefit of doubt : and have promised tht. if some part of it is needed it can be restored in Supplementaries. Makes all difference to Budget, for I can run bigger risks elsewhere – balance out later in year.

E.B. Supplementaries must be justified by information circs.

H.D. Last year we did it : and gains offset losses. no diffy. in Parliament. My point is wholly – easement for Budget position Easter.

Doctrine of virement. Services aren’t held to stated expenditure on each item – Ty. consent to virement will not be withheld.

Why do we need this easement? Posn. v. serious. Shan’t be fighting major war in next few years. C.I.G.S. statement is hopeful (Moscow). But major economic war is at our doorstep.

Am not re-opening man power issue.

Can’t M/D. come nearer to me? He appreciates economic difficulties.

A.V.A. Have bn. aware of diffies. of U.K. Said in Defence Debate tht. recovery in economic stability wd. be first condn. of sound Defence.

But request comes on top of cuts I have made in orderly way. And orderly redns are v. important because of training in period of run-downs.

79

Tried again, after Cab. to see when it wd. fall. Have tried to show what effect wd. be.

But we aren’t trying to prevent C.E. fr. achieving economic recovery. Yet Supplies. we wd. have to defend wd. be difficult.

In these v. special circs. – and no precedent for future years – if Cab. will let us take p’mmes as basis, I will try to achieve a 5% cut (£40 m. overall). This wd. mean 15% altogether. With 2 guarantees

a) Supplementaries guarantees as for 10% b) no precedent for future years.

H.D. Wd. have liked 80 m. But don’t want to continue argument.

Ready to cut 40 m. and leave it for now.

Gave assurance at a) if there is a case : hope we may avoid it.

Gave assurance re virement.

Gave assurance at b) on condn. of more sorting out of figures in future years : out-of-date account methods.

E.Sh. Other members of Cabinet are involved in this.

As M.P.’s we cd. criticise detailed Estimates. We haven’t got down here.

Have Ty. seen them?

Provisional discns. on econ. situation. Man-power : exports : grave situatn.

Not v. ready therefore to agree to present Def. Estimates of this magnitude at this stage. Will be diff. to justify to Party.

Wd. have liked further analysis on E.B.’s line.

Believe much prodn. of weapons cd. be delayed. And get the other 40m.

E.B. Two diff. points.

a) Break in design due to economy even after Munich.

Hurricane Cannon laid off even in 1938.

Design staff was my greatest headache at M/L.

b) Don’t divorce research fr. development.

Reflection on commercial aircraft.

Don’t suppose all this counts as purely military expenditure.

c) We (Coalition) never supposed we shd. get to proper Estimating by this stage after war. Hope we may next year. K.W. and J. A. never supported it.

Disposals aren’t set off.

Hope next year we can get what is aligned to 5 yr. Plan separated from rest of end/war costs.

80

d) Form of Estimates. Cd. we have standing charges shown separately eg. in Admy Vote. All this needs overhaul.

(Compromise (H.D. and AV.A.) Agreed

(try for 899 vice 900 m.

A.V.A. Remember we are carrying Poles, Colonies, Italian adminn.

[Exit C.A.S. and Service Ministers

Enter J.B.H.

2. Closer Economic Co-operation with Western Europe.

E.B. Recognise man-power diffy. But can we enlist assistce. of outside experts?

R.S.C. On tariff side, no one outside with expertise.

If you want Commonw. in (E.B. I do) makes calculns. even more complex.

E.B. Want creeping barrage twds. E. Europe.

Want to avoid talking in generalities.

W.S.C. talk of U.S. of Europe : popular, but can’t approach it that way.

P.M. This = ques of investingn.

Now working on I.T.O. How can we try to make that a success and at same time find people to plan v. its breakdown.

R.S.C. Haven’t enough people to do I.T.O. properly. Consult all industries.

: examine repercussions of all countries’ proposals. V. complex.

If we transferred them to this, we’d have to shut down on I.T.O.

Agree we must consider what to do if U.S. don’t back up I.T.O. Wd. like a broad (not detailed study of alternatives. That might be done by outside economists.

H.D. Sceptical of I.T.O. Mustn’t do anything to impede work on that.

But there will be other oppns. and dangers eg. in period fr. July 47 : 1951 when anything might happen economically.

At this point no detailed enquiry.

Leave existing C. Servants. Let R.S.C., E.B. and I try to get outside names to focus general issues.

R.S.C. Had bn. considering such a plan, with Ty. officials.

Anglo-Fr. talks are exploring this to some extent. But Monnet believes we must go much slower than this contemplate.

A. Wd. profoundly affect Commonwealth.

81

Recently had good terms fr. Doms on I.T.O. ques. Have agreed to further prelimy. talks. Diff. to find men for further study of alternatives.

Mustn’t deflect any strengths from I.T.O. But must ask tht. D.O. be represented in any study.

P.M. Can’t have Dplt. teams at present.

Let R.S.C., H.D. and E.B. make a plan for study w’out involving additional work for Dpts. Quite preliminary.

A. D.O. must be kept in touch with it.

R.S.C. Agreed.

R.S.C. Broad ques : if I.T.O. breaks down, what alternative multi-lateral arrangements can be tried or shd. we go to bi-lateral system?

3. Food Supplies.

J.S. Pressed by Mission to go to U.S. soon – I don’t think at once, but w’in next 3 wks – to press our case on meat, sugar, wheat, fats.

U.S. rapidly tearing down controls : allocns. Give us harm &amp; good. Eg. willing now to sell us meat if we support end of internatl. allocn.

Hutton thinks these bargains can now be made only at my level.

Suggested I went at once for mtg. of I.E.F.C. That was excuse only – can’t be put off until next week. I now propose to go by next Q.E. to avoid “urgency” impn. of flying.

See all disadvantages of going. But on balance believe I shd. We are at point of end/internatl. allocns. and beginning of U.S. realisation of surpluses eg. coarse grains.

E.B. Care over allocn. ques. Cab. shd. be consulted before you settle anything.

Care over publicity. Put out : going on purely business basis – to buy.

Avoid impn. we are begging. Attitude of business independence.

More chat and fewer statistics.

H.D. Reservation re dollars. Cab. have appd. a p’mme for food imports from dollar sources. All negotns. shd. be w’in. that, subject to virement.

J.S. Agreed.

T.W. Hope we’ll go : get some coarse grains – eg. livestock p’mme appd. by L.P. Cttee.

A. Unwise for J.S. to go w’out telling Canada. Also he shd. go to Ottawa as well, on his way home (or perhaps out). Agreed.

82

4. Palestine.

C.J. Kidnapping of Judge.

E.B. Why was court left unprotected – by military or by Police.

eg. Monty’s views.

C.J. Informn. re respite of sentence because of intentn. to apply for leave to appeal to Privy Council.

H.D. Has the H.C. a power to make up his mind?

A.V.A. No : eg. Alamein.

P.M. Ask him why this court was left unguarded : public not searched for arms.

C.J. Have asked for it.

P.M. Let me know.

A.V.A. C.J. might have conference – double change in H.C. and G.O.C.

C.J. Barker is expected home v. soon.
