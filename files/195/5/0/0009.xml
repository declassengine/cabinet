C.M. 9(47) 17th January 1947

1. Leakages of Information.

P.M. School-leaving age.

New development – not in war.

R.S.C. D. Telegraph always has a lot of informn.

J. Too wide a circuln. of documents in some Dpts. E.g. telegrams to P.R.O.’s

Perhaps P.M. shd. look into this.

P.M. I will.

2. Economic Survey for 1947.

a) Defence Requirements.

A.V.A. Won’t anticipate discn. of Def. Estimates.

Army : will lose trained men in ’47 : can’t do more.

Appd. aim : 300.000 in Jan. ’49.

Commitmts. : cover India : replace Indian Brigade in Persian Gulf : hold Palestine.

Basis of estimates : takes a/c all gains in f. policy : Mar. 48 no forces in V. Giuli. Greece, Austria.

Figures : Survey took 1.2 m. at 31.12.47. We actually extract 1.167 m. at that date.

Prodn : Survey took 530.000. We now budget for 474.000.

Saving 33.000 + 56.000.

In later conference with Ty. latest prodn. figure + 460.000. Total saving = 113.000.

These figures are for Dec. ’47.

Diff. for us because we have to take 31.3.48 for Def. Estimates.

For Dec. ’47 82.000 short fall in Army requirements will be accepted.

Thro’ cuts shall save 7.000 in Navy – by 31.3.48.

Total savings : 193.000. Personnel and production.

Thus 31.12.47 1.167.000 Forces ) 1.617.000

450.000 Production )

31.3.48 1.087.000 Forces ) 1.537.000

450.000 )

P.M. Def. Cttee satisf. this requd. to meet our obligns.

53

H.D. Grateful for this contn. But as we rejected a) and (in part) b), more important to consider this. These men, earlier released, wd. be of real (not speculation) value to industry. Increased productivity : best way to secure it is prodn. of machinery – and it’s here tht. these men wd. greatly help.

Choice of evils and risks. This is a period when v. unlikely we shall have war, in next year or so. Plans assume w’drawal from tender areas.

Army to be down to just over 320.000 by 31.12.48. All I am askg. is that this be quickened up. Get down to it by quicker release. This at least wdn’t be an unpopular decision. Pop. and econ. value coincide.

E.B. has bn. helpful and on earlier occasion suggd. 1 m. on understandg. of going up or down acc. to international scene. We cd. undertake to slow down again on that a/c if needs be.

Accept risk of inefficiency in 1947 – rather than risk of economic collapse.

Urge target of 1.4 by end/47 vice 1.617 m.

A.V.A. In reply to G.A.I. my figures include men under training.

R.S.C. What R.A.F. and R.N. figures correspond to army at 320.000.

A.V.A. R.A.F. peace-time was 355.000. Acceptce. of 315.000 now is due to fact they can’t get higher.

R.N. 182.000 now. 175.000 trained is prob. requirement.

Don’t wrench Forces to meet ad hoc situatns. in ’47. Don’t base long-term strengths on sitn. in ’47.

Any overall cut wd. be v. unfortunate – First time we have handled this collectively : I have harried them and got 193.000 off their requirements. I have acted with responsibility and made a contribution. Cab. can’t do detailed scrutiny which I have made. More – and you

will destroy efficiency of Forces for 10 years. Because quicker release must be of trained men because must go out acc. to groups. no one left to train intake.

Stated extent of reductions to be made – in Germany : Palestine : Sudan : India (5 inf. brigades : 3 armoured rgts : Burma (3 Batts) etc.

A.B. Ratio of popn. to Forces in U.S. and U.K.

P.M. Quite irrelevant. Land empire and sea etc.

A.B. Relevant : because strength of Forces dependent on economic strengths.

We are already out of scale because already run down supply organn. to a point at which we depend on old weapons.

Forces: contribn. they shd. do for they are coming down.

Can’t have strong Forces if economy strained and Army unpopular.

Don’t accept need for strength to support diplomacy. It is presence, not numbers of troops that count to support foreign policy.

The 10 year rule. On what assumption do we proceed today?

54

P.M. Can’t have corporate guard in V.G. Large Y. forces and diff. internal situation for that seasoned and experienced troops required. Same in Palestine. Germany too, for Nazi movement might reappear. Quicker release removes trained men : and no unit is fit to move.

After last war, f. policy was undermined because hadn’t a Brigade to go anywhere.

Too quick a run down (in groups) destroys efficiency because no one to train intake.

No suggn. of readiness for major war. But limit below wh. can’t run down to cadres. Today most squadrons cdn’t fight. Must have larger forces than ultimate figure because of training and replacement.

E.Sh. If we reject a) b) and c), there’s not much left.

But : v. vulnerable in M/E – oil : if anything lost then serious economic results.

Palestine difficult too. May ease off in a year.

Germany : fusion might facilitate some w’drawal.

Popular view wd. be run down Forces. But can’t reconcile that with commitments.

A.B. U.S. Forces have bn. run down. Are they inefficient? Yet they are as interested as us in M/E.

E.Sh. Yes : but they assume we will deal with any trouble in M/E.

They have some oil, also : we haven’t any.

Remember we have had to send troops to Basra, to protect oil interests.

Wd. it be poss. to defer consn. of this until we know how things clear in Pal. and Germany.

P.M. Army in being – reducing. But it was vastly expanded, on small cadre, with tempies You then lose your key people (sergeants) who weren’t career men and have to build it up afresh. Our demob. scheme involved losing best men and replacing with green ones.

C.E. The 7 year colour men has run out in 7 years of war.

R.S.C. Come back to para. 3. Ques of alternatives. It isn’t poss. to en’tain standards of home consumption and exports in U.K. and have these Forces. Leaving it to chance means sacrificing all.

Forces get allocns. : other sectors uncertain.

Must have exports because Loan. If we must have Forces too, we must decide how we cut consumption at home?

P.M. Agree must cut Def. cost acc. to cloth. But a slash like this in a transitional year will ruin the cloth.

A. This is a gross figure – in terms of men. Large no. shd. be women.

G.A.I. Wd. come out of industry, where female labour is shorter than male. Effect on demobiln. 1.385 at Jan 47. to 1.167 in Dec. Drop of 218.000

55

take in 225.000. So demob. total in ’47 is 443.000. That is a tidy figure.

But back R.S.C. and H.D. because labour shortage.

J.S. What will happen if we don’t? Is it just a bit worse all round. Or, from unplanned closing of gap, dislocation of economy – factory built, but no machines ready. Discrimination in net product wd. be much greater than 2.3% shortfall in manpower.

Forces already at point where cdn’t fight major war. Police. Isn’t that an Army function? Then cdn’t R.A.F. and R.N. be deliberately left inefficient in this period. Only function of Forces in ’47 must be carried by Army.

P.M. Releases fr. Forces to man factories – no good if haven’t coal or electric power.

H. Run down in R.N. sharper than in other Forces. From 900 to 200.000.

Minimum = 189.000 Mar ’48. Reduced it to 182.000 (160 trained).

Not many ships in commn. But F.A.A. much larger than ’38. Almost ⅓ of R.N. Also Commandoes and C.O.

Importce. of trained men. Can’t compare warship of today with ’38. Box of tricks, introduced in war : means high propn. of skilled men. 4/5.000 additional.

Maintenance of reserve fleet – nos. requd. to prevent deterioration.

Already cut to bone by M/D.

Not only Army who do Police work. R.N. ships went to Basra.

N.B. R.A.F. helping in Police work – in support. T.A.F. in Germany – all of it.

Transport work for other Forces and for Air Corpns. Doing all the met. work for Corpns.

Training as important for us as for any. Can’t train airmen quicker than we do. Have to lose 200.000 trained men out of 270.000 in next 2 years. Nearly 40% will still be engaged in training work on 31.3.48.

Defence Forces have contributed ⅔ of what we were asked for.

E.Sh. Coal. Excess consumption is the real trouble. Problem is how to reduce it.

Are there luxury industies we don’t want. Find them and cut them out. That’s planning.

P.M. Yes : but you haven’t so planned prodn. And until you have, releases from Forces wd. be free to go into unproductive work.

A.W. Expansion of prodn. – by working longer hours at “time and a half”. This cd. be done in M/S. indies. tho’ not eg. in cotton.

A.V.A. I have bn. trying in my sphere to help twds. planned reduction of gap.

Bearing it in mind that ineff. Forces wd. be sheer waste of Ty. money.

56

Contribn. of 113.000 on a planned basis.

Who else has made a planned contn. of this kind?

E.Sh. Can’t you cut the 450.000 prodn.

A.V.A. Original was 530.000. Passed down by me, and then at H.D.’s request again, to 450.

This follows plan made at P.M.’s earlier request for use of old stocks.

P.M. It wd. be unwise to cut on research and development.

A.V.A. Also civil use of Defence expenditure.

N.B. Believe in man-power budget. But is picture so black. Table C. 2.70 m. in June 46. 1830 m. Dec. 1.500 in June ’47. That represents a v. large turnover. In the end a much larger prodn. than today if standards are to be m’tained or raised.

A. H.D. asked for 300.000. A.V. by Mar. ’48 will have given 193.000. A large way on.

H.D. We ask 1.4 at end ’47. M/D. 1.570.000 at Mar. ’48. Cd. we have 1.5 at end ’47.

A.V.A. I’ve scraped the bottom of the tin. Going further wd. be unsafe + I wd. have to tell Parlt. so. W’drawal from India means, for defence there, we must have air lift for a Brigade : and one assault Brigade lift. Those wd. both have to go if we came down to H.D.’s figures.

Cdn’t come off Army. who will be 12.000 short of requirements : and run down by 700.000 in 2 years.

E.B.’s 1 m. was long term. Hope to reach it by end ’48. But m’while must get settlements in G. and Austria.

Can’t take heavier risks.

My main ground however is steady run-down preserving efficiency.

E.W. Isn’t financial : social stability as important in support of diplomacy. We can’t take any more cuts on home consumption.

Training. They will leave long time before they have to fight.

A.V.A. This is basis on which I have cut as far as I have.

F.W.B. Effect – going to cut primary training altogether.

Labour in unproductive work.

G.A.I. Football pools, touts at football and racing etc.

57

Poles.

N.U.M. have agreed. That won’t be many. But big effect on other industries.

Will make a report on this.

C.E. Other foreign labour.

Applns. to H.O. are discussed with M/L. Too many from artists. Shdn’t we be rather easier on admn. of people with skill willing to go into emplt. and not change w’out permission of M/Labour. H.O. believe M/L. cd. be easier on this.

G.A.I. Wd. have to be done quietly because Poles have bn. a sickener. Don’t publicise this.

C.E. P.O.W. wishing to return to farms when employed. ) Agreed.

German p.o.w. wanting to remain. )

National Govt. Staffs.

A.B. Have made a contn. by refusing compensn. on loss of office. And will use some of those displaced in Health Service.

Askg. for techn. work in commn. with Emplt. Policy.

H.D. Hope C.E.’s Cttee will produce results.

C.E. Trend of emplt. is upwards. acc. to estimates.

M/N.I. are to have separate local offices by Min. decision. Believe use cd. be made eg. of Emplt. Exchanges.

H.D. Have agreed with M/L. – and hope to get M/N.I. to agree – that M/L. offices be used at least for some years and in most places.

G.T. May I be kept informed qua accommodn.

[Exit E.Sh.

c) Defence Requirements (resumed).

P.M. Can’t go beyond A.V.A.’s figures w’out wrecking Forces.

C.E. Re-examine later in year if circs. change.

P.M. Foreign Legion.

H.McN. Discussed in F.O. Pretty strong arguments in favour.

Political diffies. are great. But economic consns. outweigh perhaps.

Suggest considns. by Ministers immediately after Moscow.

A.B. Mixed force – wd. be easier than purely Polish. Gurkhas, for example.

58

N.B. Our experience : foreign members of R.A.F. were gt. success. Mixed units were v. successful. Wd. oppose a Polish Force or unit. But as individuals they have done well and we wd. use them if legal diffies. cd. be overcome – might get 5.000. Important to promise them natn.

H.McN. On our pay roll already.

N.B. And trained, too.

H.D. Disappointing to us who made the plan. Sorry we can’t ever take large decisions.

If we go on thus, we shall end in critical situation in a year or so.

Will consider our posn. if Cab. make a habit of rejecting my advice.

P.M. Must tackle this ques. in another way. Attack Forces because can get men off them.

Other unproductive activities you don’t attack. You can’t control them.

Must get this across more clearly to U.K. public opinion.

[ Exit T.W.

J. Can’t we have bigger drive for import of Balts.

G.A.I. Not until we have filled demand for domestic staff of hospitals.

Will, however, enquire.

Coal. Recommns. approved.

Steel. [Exit F.W.B.

A.B. Here is result of lack of a wages policy.

G.A.I. Have urged unattractive industies. to improve conditions. Now asking other industries in W. Paper to be publd. next week, not to make correspondg. improvements.

A.B. We must put ceilings on wages.

E.W. Then on profits also.

R.S.C. Para. 37. Economy Cttee will handle this.

Building. Recommenns. appd.

Agriculture. Houses. Mining : Houses

A.B. Can’t build for ag. workers – must be acc. to need in area. Same in mining.

J.W. Disgrace. I’m going to earmark. Sc. Housing Assocns. will build, for N.C. Bd. who will let only to miners – in new Fife coal field. 59

A.B. Won’t work. Won’t get alum. houses – all allocated for ’47.

E.W. L.a. will allocate to local deserving cases : won’t take a/c of economic condns.

A.V.A. Recommn. in memo. is general. J.W.’s plan might lead to tied houses.

J.W. Cd. tie houses to industry, not individuals.

P.M. That issue must be considered more fully.

A.B. Even on genl. issue I can’t adjust appd. p’mme, to transfer houses fr. one area to another

Can do this in 1948 p’mme.

A.W. The Ministers can allocate priorities in aluminium houses. They cd. meet this to some extent.

A.B. But Airey houses aren’t in ’47 p’mme. Will go into rural areas in ’48.

Approve principle : let Ministers find means of doing as much as they can.

A. Drive to improve W.L.A. To increase labour force in agriculture.

May M/Ag. be ordered to review conditions?

Agreed.

White Paper.

R.S.C. Can’t present picture of deficiencies with no remedies.

Best to p’pone until autumn.

A.G. L.P. intended debate at end/Feb.

H.D. Budget immediately after Easter Recess. 15/4.

A.G. Cd. have this debate end March.

R.S.C. What can we say?

A.B. Increased effort.

R.S.C. Not planning : bound to be criticised.

P.M. Can see it as factual statement, but not as planning because we don’t control.

Will be criticised a) you don’t plan or b) you mean to plan and that = servile State.

60

Wdn’t W.P. provoke discn. of wages policy etc. Shown tht. if you want to plan this is what you will have to do.

H.D. Can’t produce a defensible W. Paper on this – in view of Cab. decision.

P’pone : try to make a plan for ’48 : produce it to Cab. later in the year.

P.M. Much to be said for that.

A.B. Why can’t you show a deficit? You sometimes do in a Budget.

We shd. be saying – here is a man-power gap : unless filled by greater effort, effect will be inflationary. Ask existg. man-power to make good lack of the 500.000 of so gap.

H.McN. Pol. advantages of publishg. Diffies. with Unions etc. Consider this.

R.S.C. M/L. on publishing a W. Paper.

A. Need we talk about “planning”. We haven’t taken powers.

R.S.C. Power to control all save workers.

A.W. Figures are impressive. Shows diffies. of Govt. Wd. help to get more work out of people.

P.M. Time to consider this issue.

3. Road Transport Strike.

Thanks to Services to be conveyed in letter from P.M.

4. Burma Conversations.

P.M. Burma under emergency sectn. by wh. Gov. rules with nominad. Council.

Planned to have in Apl. elections – weightg. for Europeans. Alleged Europeans swung Govts. They don’t want to go back to 1935 Parlt. Want a constituent Assembly. Cd. be elected under machinery of 1935 Act.

Think we shd. concede this.

C.A. wd. sit : 2 members for each constituency.

Interim Govt. We can’t enact full powers under ’35 Act. Proposed as India, to treat them as if they were Dom. Govt.

Legislation: 50 nominated at present. Now proposed : enlarged body, say 100 (Order in Parlt). But as emergency condns. Still, Govr. to appoint fr. C.A. a legislat. body. Ministers wdn’t be respons. to it. But it wd. tk. some form of popular Govt.

61

May get agreement with them on these lines.

Main point for them is a C.A. Don’t want to be pedantic about this.

Agreed : Delegation to follow this line.
