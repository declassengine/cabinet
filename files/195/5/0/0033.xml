1. Parliament.

A.G. Civic Restaurants Bill Lords Amendments first.

P.M. Add 15/4 = Budget Day.

2. Town Planning: Powers of City of London.

P.M. Proposed by new Bill to deprive City of planning powers : with certain rights to be exercised in conjunctn. with L.C.C. L.S. thght. easiest way wd. be to have City as planning authy. Will be opposed by L.C.C. and Labour Party. Will be advocated in H/L. Which do we choose?

L.S. Politics apart, I wd. have thought City shd. be a planning authy.

H.D. Political arguments outweigh. Vote down opposition.

J. Prestige : say both are planning authies. but L.C.C. in posn. of ct. of appeal.

L.S. That is what L.C.C. oppose.

Agreed : Politics to prevail. [Exit L.S

ships can be arranged.

Repair yards : seamanship etc.

R.S.C. Paras 1 and 3. Does it mean handing over to G? Won’t they be

operated by Anglo. U.S. authies.?

J.B.H. As in memo. Turns mainly on dollar ques. Saving may be double the estimate of 40 m. dollars. Depends on use made of the ships – cd. be much greater if use not restricted to food.

[Enter A.

B. This wd. be complete reversal of U.S. shipping policy. The ships wd. go to G. on ban boat basis – wh. has bn. refused to us and other Allies.

Congress wd. have to reverse decisions – won’t go thro’ early.

Fr. our angle. wd. reduce our chances of cutting into G. trade.

If we are to agree, must have some condns.

H. We oppose – on security grounds. G. shipping potential. H’to policy of destroying it. This cdn’t be tempy. expedient : wd. be diff. to stop it.

180

J.B.H. Yes : but G. wd. man the ships.

R.S.C. Then it won’t create a G. merchant navy.

P.M. Any more than using G. crews for minesweeping.

E.Sh. Emplt. of G. seamen. Avoid that and there’s no objn. to the proposal.

We shd. have more informn. re details of control : schedule of

conditions : rub in to U.S. comparison with their treatment of us re

H. Will require repairing facilities. Might add to building ships. Also wd. support the case for G. shipping in interests of G. balance/payments.

B. Wd. depend on conditions imposed.

J.S. We support this – as easement to food imports.

H.D. 80 m. in all : about ½ to Br. per year. Nearly all our saving wd. be in dollars.

Accept : on understandg. tht. doesn’t mean any change of view re G. shipbldg.

These cd. be repaired outside Germany.

P.M. G. seamen will serve eg. under Panamanian flag.

J.B.H. G. seamen will cost nothing in dollars.

Mc.N. Hoover is aware of the pol. diffies. will accept any reasonable qualification.

T.W. Can’t keep G. out of emplt. for ever. We’ve already changed our attitude.

A.V.A. This means 750 deep sea officers – who wd. otherwise melt off into land emplt. Keeps a nucleus in being. ships on bars boat charter : keep security risks under review.

H.D. Accept: making it clear we don’t agree to any revival of G. mercantile.

used by the tourists.

J.W. 600 t. of steel. Mustn’t come from civil allocations.

C.K. a) Higher priority. Nothing higher is available. Avoid super-priorities.

P.M. This comes at a v. unfortunate time.

Cd. they not similarly find the materials?

G.A.I. W’draw the invitn.

How many cd. Uxbridge hold w’out new bldg?

N.B. 1.200.

R.S.C. Distribute the remaining 800/1.000.

{Service Dpts. to find room for remaining 800/1.000.

N.B. I originally preferred 1952. Others pressed for 1948, to encourage tourism. Might bring £1 m. in f. exchange : apart from “moral” gain if we do it well.

Crucial point : accommn. of teams.

b) Can’t find the steel fr. other p’mmes.

G.A.I. And shortage of labour in London.

H.D. The money cd. come out of Air Miny. Vote.

F.J.B. Dividend fr. Games.

C.E. Compare with mid-week sport restns.

Mc.N We are commd. to this : known the world over. When we ???? for f. exchange can we w’draw invitn. quick : accepted.

182

[Exit. Wilson. C.K., J.W. 5. Sugar Supplies.

P.M. Nutritional ques : to be referred to offl. Cttee and reported to Cab. in

due course.

H.D. Dollars : in a month’s time we can discuss genl. position on import

p’mme for 47/48.

U.S. credit : heavier drain this year, partly because combined Zone of

Germany.

My concln. we shd. give nothing away at this stage. At least wait

another month. Might have to w’draw later an increase in rations given

now.

Can. credit is being exhausted more rapidly than U.S.

Can’t be sure this will slow up.

Can’t reach firm conclns. this a.m.

P.M. Confine this discussion to sugar.

J.S. H.D.’s rule will cause food posn. to deteriorate because other goods may have to be cut on other grounds. E.g. tea and prs. meat later in the year.

Thus, when we can make increases, don’t miss the chance to compensate losses elsewhere. Sugar is only known case when we have the supplies to warrant an increase.

Will a deteriorating food posn. help us with b) payments? Shan’t we lose as much as we gain.

We have bought this sugar. Only ques. shd. we store it, in order to make sure we can m’tain supplies in 1949. No need to buy more dollar sugar in order to m’tain ration to end/48. P.M. What assumptn. re home crop – 1/3rd of our supplies. Suppose floods

put our next years’ crop down?

By ’49 we shall be wholly free of dollar sugar.

J.S. Press conceal good and stress bad, if announced simultaneously.

T.W. Fens are heavy beet. growing area.

J.S. Variation : 10% of ⅓ of total supply. Not v. important factor.

Prioritise : if H.D. must cut back our dollar spending on food, don’t cut back basic things like sugar.

H.D. Am not opposing purchase, but distribution.

P.M. Better to wait and balance this increase against a cut, eg. in tea.

H.D. When will meat cut come?

183

J.S. Don’t yet know. Shall make it in summer.

J.S. Strong pressure : said price not higher than beef : tendency for price to

rise now, so we cd. oil out of it.

P.M. Can it be Agreed : increase sugar ration at time of another cut, wthr.

tea or meat.

6. Domestic Fuel Rationing

T.W. 20.000 t. loss and loss of condn.

J. Reserve an increase until first season.

A. Some relief needed : sugar is useful increase. Do it when you cut tea.

J.S. Accept that, and consider meat position.

E.Sh. Turkeys : if not a precise condn. hope we won’t buy them at all.

E.Sh. No.

Agreed : Suspend : bring up again in commn. with a cut in other foods.

[Exit Edwards .

E.Sh. As in memo.

R.S.C. Want a more effective statement. Showing a) industrial need b) target for domestic saving etc. – as in note by E.E.B. Threaten the rationing scheme if savings not secured.

Set out the standard as a target to aim at. Will educate public and let us know reactions to diffies.

E.Sh. I accept that.

P.M. Must make it today. Don’t want to say we will put in a scheme if I don’t believe we can. (statement on lines proposed by R.S.C.

R.S.C. It isn’t imposs. : it’s diff. and expensive in man power.

P.M. Frankly, I don’t believe it wd. work.

E.Sh. Publicity.

R.S.C. Must fit in with genl.

Agreed : (introduce E.Sh. prohibitions.

184

[Enter C.O.S. and

Cunningham and G.O.C.

Palestine.

7. Palestine : Public Order. Mufti raising guerrillas. Are you stopping that?

P.L. How long can you detain?

J. Agency is losing influence over J. popn. When we asked for their coopn.

it became clear tht. their posn. depended on opposing Govt. They

are losing ground, partly to extremists, but more to U.S. Zionists.

Believe large nos. shd. resign. Chance of a come-back by Weizmann.

Statements made by High Commr. and G.O.C.

Ques : effect of Grover’s execution

H.C. Can’t open frontier with Egypt. Police action and black list.

T.W. 75 terrorists captured. What done to them? H.C. 3 mil. courts before whom those brought v. whom definite evce. but these cases, usually no evce. will be interred under 18b model. we have picked up all whom we believe to be members. Even J. parents don’t know wh. sons belong.

H.C. No legal limit. Found on arrival in Pal. some who had bn. detained already 4/5 years.

Recruits fr. among illegal immigrants. Told Agency they shd. keep terrorists off these ships. Regular illegal traffic isn’t promoted by terrorist organns. But recent shipments organised by Bergson? in Paris are diff. For he is assocd. with terrorists organns. and will prob. feed them in. Only hope is to send these to Cyprus : keep them isolated.

G.A.I. Attitude of T.U.’s?

H.C. They are most v. terrorism of all others. They have some power and if they use their Hagana v. terrorists they will be large influence.

Weizmann has bn. standing back. Has recently bn. talkg. to Agency.

Agency groups : Silver (U.S.) Ben Gurion (Labour) Revisionists.

Report by Chiefs of Staff W’spread m. law wdn’t assist in problem of dealing with small no. of

criminals.

Close cordoning. Was right thing to do. Unfortunate tht. it was called

in late. Did help. Can be done again.

Best assistnce. to men on the spot wd. be summary courts actg. quickly.

if that can be done legally.

C.A.S. Have consulted C. in. C. and discussed with G.O.C. Pal.

185

C.J. Concern in para. 17. Par. 18(a) shd. be carefully considered by Cab.

P.M. Memo. shd. be put to Cab. on detail of composn. procedure and powers

of these courts. Colonial Off. to submit eg. draft O-in-C.

J. Grover. Learn to appeal: by relatives in turn. Authies can now consider

wthr. one appln. having bn. refused, he shd. be executed.

J. Higher penalties shd. be provided for by O-in-C.

R.S.C. Not to a single mil. officer. Shd. be at least 3 – or assessor.

C.J. Second ques : stop legal quibbles over appeals.

F.J.B. Death Sentences not by officer lower in rank than Brigadier.

J. Jurisdn. of court shd. cover all terrorist crime.

C.E. Consider something like A.G.’s fiat on the spot. R.S.C. But don’t call it “statutory martial law”. Imposn. of special powers.

A.V.A. Interference with civil life may be v. serious.

P.M. Shdn’t be imposed in future without reporting to Cabinet. (after the
