C.M.18(47) 7th February 1947

1. Coal : Parliamentary Debate.

A.G. 4 hour debate : Govt. Spokesman? Will be general debate.

P.M. Weight of debate will be on allocations to industry. Cd. R.S.C. spk. early?

E.Sh. Can’t give appearance of divided responsibility. Shd. 2 Cab. Ministers intervene?

Agreed : E.Sh. to take debate. R.S.C. to be on the Bench.

Electricity.

E.Sh. Many ships have arrived in South since y’day.

190.000 t. will arrive acc. to M/T. But not for electricity alone. wh. consumed 150.000 t. last week.

Read statement L. and S.E./N.W./Midl. : a no. of power stations must

go out : rely on Grid : lower supply : drastic cuts. Thus, as fr. Sund. a.m. no electr. to industry and none for dom. consumers betwn. hrs stated y’day. (9-12 a.m. 2-4 p.m.).

Contin. process industries. will have enough to avoid damage to plant.

Might last 3 days : or maybe 1 wk.

Reason : coal prodn. in Yorks. fallen to 50%. This plus transport diffy.

Now ½ m. tons on ground.

Asked my advisers a) cuts on 2 days a wk : not enough.

b) how enforce ¨if factories won’t cut. Answer : can cut selectively because expce. in shedding load, wh. has bn. done w’out interf. with essential services.

c) cuts on dom. load alone? In Ldn. excess of industrial, but not elsewhere. Saving wd. not therefore be enough.

This is v. drastic. But smaller stations will stop anyhow. This will enable larger stations to m’tain essential services.

R.S.C. May factories have light : some cd. carry on if so.

E.Sh. Will consider that point.

Cd. avoid this if we knew coal wd. begin to come in next week. But can’t be sure. If stations collapsed at end/next week, our posn. wd. be even worse.

Because of this, I yesterday stopped export and foreign bunkers. Allowed 3 ships to go on bunkering.

Propose we state this wd. operate from Sunday a.m.

C.E. Worst time to bring in domestic cut. Sunday a.m. cooking.

105

And what saving – when industrial load is v. light.

General agreement begin Monday a.m.

Bunker Coal.

B. Discussed officially : large measure of agreement reached.

But E.Sh. issued instns. before it came to me.

Will expect shipping. Delicate negotns. with U.S. re return of U.S. chartered ships and purchase of ships. In midst of all that, E.Sh. makes and announces arbitrary decision w’out consultg. me.

40.000 t. of coal involved – 30/40 ships immobilised.

Shan’t get our food in, if we don’t get ships away.

R.S.C. If you stop industry, some of their coal can be used. Take 40.000 t. from them.

J.S. Delay in shipping beyond 2/3 days might be disastrous to food. Our stocks are dangerously low.

P.M. 40.000 t. wd. not be worth this price. Agreed : continue bunkering B. ships.

E.Sh. Exports? B. don’t oppose those cuts.

R.S.C. Cd. afford to cut those. Agreed.

P.M. Bunkering abroad : and bunkering foreign ships here ¨to be discussed between M/T. and M/F. &amp; P. (with M/F. as observers).

Agreed.

R.S.C. Tell industry its for a week.

2. Palestine.

E.B. Jews wdn’t accept any scheme of Palestine which we cd. support.

…… part not heard.

Conclude because in favour of intermediate plan.

Since W. Paper J. immigration 75.000 + 25.000 since we took office. In last 10 yrs. 65.000 J. refugees admitted to U.K.

We have told Arabs we can’t accept their demand for no more . immigrn.

If there is to be immigrtn. both sides accept econ. absorption capacity as criterion.

Diffy. because Jews won’t employ Arabs. Jews admit and explain it. They now say cd. be removed : rule of no discriminn. adopted [in J.].

State.

106

Pressed J. y’day to say wthr. they wd. discuss proposals if we put them fwd.

Rejection in principle won’t get us anywhere.

Seemed to me that autonomous areas might be discussed with J.

With A.- if no Partition – might get some discn. on immigration.

Continuance of existing. Mandate is intolerable. Art. 6 : almost impossible to safeguard A. rights : facilitate J. immigration. Wd. be practicable if A. and J. collaboration secured. But don’t accept J. estimate of absorption capacity. Tho’ they import capital and skill. Pal. can’t hold the nos. they propose.

Neither side will like appln. for Trusteeship.

Immigration – proposal as in paras. 9 and 10 of Appendix. Arbitration – follows Satellite Treaties : have had in mind R. acceptance of arbitration. Need to avoid putting T. Council in posn. to intervene in adminn. of mandated territies.

Mandatory Govt. – not rooted in public opinion or pol. institutions. Need to build up local adminn. from the bottom. J. giving indications of readiness to consider. Propose sharing responsibility for Police : as in U.K. grant-aided from the centre. Develop sense of responsibility.

If all fails, put it to U.N. w’out recommn. – but putting to them all the schemes that have bn. suggested. Let U.N. choose. Not, of course, H.M.G. Tho’ Arabs do regard us as pledged. In particular, we can’t accept Land Transfer restns : no immigration : dominance of our community over another of the centre.

Belief that in the end A. &amp; J. will come into political, not racial, alignment in voting at elections.

Additions to Appendix – as circulated.

These arose from discns. with Jews.

Stress co-operative effort in trade betwn. A. &amp; J.

Also wagers diffy. because of low standards of Arab workers.

C.O.S. Concern at limit of 5 years. Our reason : to meet criticism at U.N. that we are mainly concerned with our strategic interests even at expense of country’s pol : econ. development. We shd. know in 5 years wth. Reg. Def. under U.N. is to be a reality. If there is a risk to ourselves we must take it – on political grounds. After 5 years, we must rely on Treaty rights : can’t safeguard that in any Trusteeship Agreement.

Need to hold both sides here and keep them talking. No advantage in losing patience. If we cd. get them to talk we might get some interim easement on immigration.

C.J. Recommend this as discussable proposn. [Exit E.Sh.

Formerly I believed only course was to impose Partitions. C.O. and H. Comms. agreed. But as I examd. Partition, so I saw its diffies. If attempt made to apply it, then wd. be lasting trouble in Pal. V. diff. to get a viable J. State w’out harm to Arabs. Many. A. wd. be dominated by

107

Jews. Also diffy. with U.N. While we negotiated, posn. in Pal. wd. be deteriorating.

[Exit R.S.C.

So far, J. haven’t advanced Partn. scheme. Haven’t shown opposn. to unitary State. Divns. among them. But they want removed the worst features of W. Paper. This wd. do that, particularly as regards immigrn. and Land Transfer (w’in J. areas.)

A.B. Econ. absorption capacity. A. wd. oppose anything wh. wd. give J. majority.

Will arbitn. decide?

E.B. Yes.

C.J. Believe J. will discuss.

P.M. Worth putting it fwd. If you were discussing with reasonable people, it might have a chance. But they aren’t. Frankly, I’m sceptical over acceptance. Can’t take much longer. Shd. go to U.N. soon.

H.D. Tell them, if they won’t take this, we put it all to U.N.

This is their last chance.

E.B. Not in that tone of voice anyway!

Not inclined to put this as ultimatum.

Have still to find means of holding M/East – with least cost to Ty.

Hays report on Iraq : irrign. can extend cultiv. area fr. 5 to 20 m. acres.

Must talk to U.S. on this. All these territories rely too much on one product.

Want to put this to them in a reasonable spirit.

T.W. Land Transfers. Proposed to devolve this on L. authies. But only 20% of Jews are in rural areas.

E.B. J. area must be such as to include enough rural land.

P.L. a) Para. 9. Don’t say “the J. National Home”.

b) No difft. from Wanchope scheme in 1930. Little chance of its working.

A.V.A. First hope in para. 12. Begin to operate on our own. That wd. be good.

Why then offer at this stage only 5 years. Why not review after 5 years.

A.B. That wd. destroy all hope of establishg. good intentns. of H.M.G.

Fatal to throw that away.

J. 10 years. Will take more than 5 to do it.

General view – leave it at 5 years.

108

N.B. This wd. put us in strong posn. in U.N.

We shall be in stronger posn. there if we retain 5 years.

Believe we shall get a Treaty – as with Iraq &amp; Transjordan.

J.S. This wd. be good if we got acquiescence.

If we don’t, can we have assurance tht. we don’t let things drag on.

Unless it produced changes of heart in Pal. there wd. be no advantage to us. We shd. go to U.N. in order to end an unsatisf. situation.

E.B. We report to U.N. at once, if we fail in this fortnight.

A.V.A. Disagree with N.B.

No need to say 5 years now

C.O.S. advised Pal. vital to our M/E. post. Staff Confce. endorsed this. . Keep C.O.S. with us on this. They fear

consequences of going to U.N.

P.M. Early independence is cardinal point in negotiating this. Otherwise

both sides will play you off.

They may want us to stay – but more so if we set a definite term to

Trusteeship.

We might then be advised to continue Trusteeship.

General agreement : support this scheme.

P.M. Reports of division of opinion on this subject in Cab.

E.B. Crossman demanding we shd. meet Party. We have refused.

Base w’out goodwill is useless.

[Exit A.

E.B. Called attentn. to para. 15 of App.

But knowledge tht. they have to face internatl. body may compel them to be more reasonable.

C.E. They won’t be faced up to that if it’s 10 years.

Ministers shd. not discuss what happens in Cab. – especially with members of Party : not all of whom are reliable.

Good thing for colleagues to differ in Cabinet.
