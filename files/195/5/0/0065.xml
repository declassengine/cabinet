relativity acc. to importance b) new Nat. Tribunal. It is,

statement: or basis for our discn with T.U.C. In earlier discns

our own minds &amp; use it as basis at least for discussions if not

to oppose.

Practical diffies as in memo. Para. 2.

R.S.C. Brought up because mtg. with T.U.C. Mon. Also coming award to

Tried in this draft to show a) our view on minimum and new basis of

however, a) to which I attach most importance. Either public

we were handicapped by lack of policy. Can we at last clear

not for propaganda.

G.A.I. Accept the purpose. Ques: method.

New cycle is starting. Some “relative” unjustified: others are diff.

T.U.C. are thinkg. – some movemt. to meet us.

(1) as memo. Communists trying to break T.U.’s by unofficial

(2) As in memo. Also, wd. it be proper for Govt. to refer to the new

(3) As in memo. Are we going to follow 14th century Statute of

350

Labourers in forbidding payment of more than x.

Men willing to accept lower wage in secure

(5) Labour is askg. if we increase prodn by 10% who is to get the

(6) Better (pour rire) reduce wages in non-essential industries. job. cf. peace

Suggestion: another way. T.U.C. likely to call conference of

Let us propose a Govt. spokesman there to put issues &amp; give a

will gain because prices or subsidies will rise. Some of the

undermanned indies are victims of cycle – cf. roadmen &amp;

Managemt. must contribute too. But workers are drawg. on

T.U.C. can’t make this sort of offer to Govt. Too much for Govt. to

Find it diff. to support idea of Central Tribunal – wd. bring Govt.

bottom of list of standard rates.

Standard wage £4-5 a wk. Real wage lower than ’39.

Not therefore pre-war gap that has caused posn. Tho’ I agree

in docks since de-casualisation.

Executive in December. A.E.U. are suggestg. Govt. shd.

lead.

T.U.C. can’t however bind individual Unions.

H.M. Discussions in L.P. Cttee. Sympathy with both views. Something

must be done. Higher wages &amp; shorter hours mean a) no one

farm-workers. b) Our exports must be at competitive prices.

overdraft. Buyers market will knock us.

make public statement on these lines. But Govt. shd. put proposn

to T.U.C. Possibly alternatives a) this draft b) proposal tht.

Govt. put economic facts to both parties in negotiations and

Tribunals. c) T.U. leaders &amp; Ministers to exercise restraint.

d) Possibly, as threat, mention statutory wages stop.

P.M. Can agree on genl. posn &amp; need to stop spiral.

Ques. really is what we can do.

Objns well put by M/Labour.

in wages arena.

E.B. Is there a case for any action?

Is there any inflation in standard wage rates to-day?

What has happened since 1940 – narrowing of gap between top &amp;

Posn of T.U. leader with stat. maximum. Impossible.

During war increased incentive paymts enormously.

In Germany we have fixed wages &amp; prices. Result: no chance of

getting any incentive arrangement. Workers doomed to slavery.

Dockers: 19/= a day basic rate. But 110% of pre-war output.

If output continues to rise, are you to say that because c/living

hasn’t risen they are to get no more.

1921-26 all these things were tried.

True, classifn (relativities) shd. be changed.

Roadmen. Agric. risen from 34/= to £4.10.0.

Roadmen .. .. £2.5.0 to £4.12.0. 351

we haven’t got due equilibrium.

What is present turn-over of labour? V. small, in spite of

dislocation of war &amp; reconversion. 200.000 p.wk. out of

18 million. In U.S.A. they get 100-150% p.a.

who will still be able to get more remuneration somehow.

&amp; liberties of T.U. movement.

A.B. Much in what E.B. said about exaggeration of “excessive wages”.

M/L. progress twds. stability. Why shd. Govt, itch to get

into this? Whatever you do, you won’t touch management –

Preservation of our liberties depends on free negotiation of wages

Remarkable degree of stability – thanks to T.U. responsibility.

But relative levels – E.B. doesn’t get this right. Small turnover

is not healthy sign when we want to change distribution of man-power. It is too easy for some sections to get wage

mobility.

increases e.g. clerks &amp; municipal workers. We want more

Can’t have economic plan and laissez-faire attitude to wages. I submitted proposal earlier: consider what we can do about

worker &amp; employer interest doesn’t operate. We cd. say that

where Govt. have direct interest they must have a right to

to take millions fr. Exchequer: also l.a.’s thro’ grants: possibly

Favour putting these diffies to T.U.C.

E.B. Cab. has had no evce tht. wages are inflated, or tht. under-manned

are too high.

A.B. Will Cab. ever accept posn tht. Govt. are employers

R.S.C. Problem is how do we make wages fit in with planned economy.

Put in my memo. to crystallise ideas – not wedded to these.

public sector of industry – where the normal play betwn.

come in on wages. E.g. building, where both sides can agree

wherever there is a Govt. subsidy.

T.W. Automatic increases on relativities. Must make diffies of that clear.

indies lack workers because wage diffies, or tht. wage standards

G.T. Support E.B.

tht. we are running planned economy.

P.M. Immediate ques: what line do we take with T.U.C.

Under-manned indies: clearly wages is one factor.

If we take E.B.’s line, no point in discussg. with T.U.C.

If we go on with these discussions, we must know what we are

aiming at.

Last talk with T.U.C. was most embarrassing because Cab. had

no policy.

E.B. No one has told me which are the under-manned industries? 352

G.A.I. May I produce list of pending claims, for Monday. Put the facts

down for discn with T.U.C.
