C.M. 82(47). 23rd October, 1947.

1. Parliament.

Business for this week &amp; next.

2. Parliament: Committee of Privileges.

H.M. V. diff. &amp; important.

A.G.’s view: main ques. if no breach of privilege, no action open.

conduct is judgmt. of H/C. – even on misdemeanour

Believe him to be wrong on this. Not necessary to

take the point wtr. it was ques. of privilege. Disgraceful

(cf. Bottomley) it’s not automatic on conviction.

Party mtg: may be privileged if related to specific piece of Parly.

business. This wasn’t &amp; unwise to claim it.

Dangers of going too far – a) don’t want it extended to

to smaller mtgs b) don’t want to exclude courts

c) might be a duty to disclose somethg. scandalous.

Fasten therefore on the money &amp; hold it’s disgraceful conduct.

P.M. Any precedent for disgraceful conduct apart from a conviction?

H.M. Believe so.

R.S.C. Must be conduct as a Member.

H.M. Yes, but not in relation to performing duties as a Member.

A.B. Articles openly published in own name wd. not be disgraceful.

H.M. A.G.’s case is based on Sandys. But that was in reln to specific

piece of Parly. business.

Argument for not penalising journalists is that they aren’t M.P.’s.

But House shd. warn them for the future. Motion in para. 14.

To lay down the doctrine.

Limitation of Cttee’s function. Think they are takg. too narrow a view

of their functions. Wise therefore to remove doubts, as in 16.

Tho’ original Motion has gone too far.

J. V. diff. point. Don’t think disclosure of Party mtg. is breach/privilege.

If no such breach, is his dishon. conduct in his capacity as M.P?

V. diff: but inclined to say “yes”.

Much to be said for being content with reprimand – in view of doubt

&amp; diffy.

R.S.C. Para. 13 Motion. First part is clear – affront to House.

Second: this is not offence with wh. he has bn. accused &amp;

327

hasn’t had opportunity to answer. It is a 2nd breach not yet tried

by Cttee. Cttee shd. have come back to H/C. &amp; reported the

further offence.

Cttee saw him again &amp; he had chance to clear himself with them.

H.M. Many precedents – offence to give misleadg. evce.

Can also spk. to H/C.

R.S.C. Then put it as aggravation of 1st offence, not as 2nd substantive offence.

Third: “informn about Parly. matters” v. wide. Oblign of

confidence not to Parlt. Was to Party. Wd. apply if this is

correct. Wasn’t disclosure about Parly. matters.

Better therefore say this man has not behaved as a M.P. should.

A.B. It is the clandestine sale that matters. He obtd informn qua M.P. &amp;

sold it clandestinely to a newspp.

J. That wd. open discn wtr. this was in his capacity as a Member.

R.S.C. Accusn shd. be obtaing. informn fr. other M.P.’s – that is why it is

conduct “tending to destroy mutual confidence betwn. M.P.’s.”

Substitute “from other M.P.’s” for “about Parly. matters”.

H.M. That wd. apply to informn about Derby winner obtd from one M.P. by

another.

A.W. Isn’t anything breach/privilege which obstructs Members in doing

their duty – incldg. fear of being betrayed to Press.

P.M. Goes much too far. Wd. apply to ridiculing a man in his own

constituency.

A.B. Add: “from other Members in his capacity as a Member.”

R.S.C. After Allighan, “in his capacity as a Member corruptly accepted

payment for the disclosure of informn obtained from other

Members of Parlt. under the oblign of confidence.”

R.S.C. So wd. “about Parly matters” – and on less secure ground.

H.M. Will consider part 3 in light of discussion.

A.B. Second para. Is it wise to press this? X-examn by K.C.’s on

Cttee. He had no legal defence.

R.S.C. Wdn’t matter if had told the truth.

A.B. H/C. doesn’t like persecution of individual Member.

H.M. This is clearest point of all. 328

Penalties. Allighan.

H.M. There will be strong feeling in favour of at least suspension.

Must distinguish in favour of Walkden. Reprimand &amp; severe

reprimand doesn’t mark distinction enough.

lose public confidence otherwise.

Suspension fr. now till Easter recess is about right.

Likely to be criticised as too light.

N.B. Make penalty as stiff as poss.

R.S.C. Short of suspension, will be laughing stock.

A.B. Public exposure is enough.

Suspension penalises the constituency.

G.T. Opinion in constituencies – much shaken by this. Must make an

example of him. Must mark enormity of his offence. Shall

Agreed: Severely reprimand and suspend, without salary.

A.B. protesting.

Walkden.

H.M. Reprimand wd. be enough.

No motion before us yet.

P.M. Is W. guilty at all? Cttee put it on b/privilege.

H.M. We shd. have to put it on “3rd para.” grounds.

N.B. W. has bn. on dangerous courses. Tried to get contract for firm

incldg. his son - &amp; threatened me, when at Air Ministry.

Needs a severe shock.

Agreed: Reprimand only.

Clk to H/C. after debate. Paras. 14 and 16 approved.

[Exit W.W. Enter J.S.

3. Food: Potato Supplies.

Heighway.

Cab. Paper: copies to A.G. before debate. Approve – reprimand.

(P.M. to settle)

J.S. Grave situation. Don’t pretend this scheme will be satisfactory.

Also, grave burden on whole rationing scheme.

Rationing imposs. because home-produced food (95%) &amp;

sources not sufficiently w’in our control.

Calory intake, with other cuts, down to 2.675. Hope R.S.C. won’t

329

deny in H/C. that this is disastrous level

consequence of disastrous decision to make these cuts vice

R.S.C. I won’t speak of it as “disastrous”.

J.S. Nutritional experts will say so, backed by Govt. publns. And

tobacco, films.

P.M. Isn’t scheme likely to break down? Wide variations in potato

consumption. Retailers control. Rural sources etc. Shd. we

assume this responsibility? Voluntary scheme?

R.S.C. Wd. mean none at all left by March or April.

E.B. If Govt. buy the pots. can’t we have offl. control of distribn?

R.S.C. Cd. this be linked with bread ration – same differential for pots. as

now for bread.

J.S. On a full rationing scheme.

R.S.C. Why not on distribution scheme, too.

J.S. By asking retailer to give the same as for bread.

R.S.C. That’s what I meant.

J.S. Greengrocers unused to rationing. More diff. to do it.

J. Can’t we regulate supply to shops.

R.S.C. Must then have some control from shop to consumer.

J.S. 175.000 holdg. stocks for commercial use.

A.V.A. Crop isn’t lower than 1931. We then coped by size of riddle, &amp; vol.

trade agreement re issue. Trade handled this before.

Only diffce is shortage of other starch foods.

T.W. That makes a fundamental difference.

A.B. This calory redn is calamitous. We can’t conceal it. Jameson, if

asked, must tell the truth.

R.S.C. I can’t dodge makg. a statement.

A.B. This, on top of other cuts, will have depressing effect. Public won’t

accept our priorities. Not satisfd tht. our earlier decisions were

taken on firm figures.

Heavy workers are heavy potato eaters. Everything reduced at same 330

time.

A.W. Potatoes aren’t there.

P.M. Must link this with bread. If you cd. lift bread rationing at same

time, this wd. do.

H.M. No time for handling public presentn if R.S.C. has to announce to-day.

Why not foreseen?

Blow to public morale?

Shd. link with abandonment of (shoddy) bread-rationing.

E.B. I accepted the other cuts as cuts in food from dollar area. Hope they

will be so presented. Can change later if b/paymts. looks better.

This, so far as we can see, is the worst. And we go on trying

to do better, from alternative sources.

J.S. Now limited by Ty. total for food fr. non-dollar sources.

H.D. Ready to raise those limits, after negotiation betwn. Ty. &amp; M/Food.

E.B. Wd. prefer to say R.S.C. &amp; H.D. to fix adjusted ceiling &amp; methods of

increasing supplies from non-dollar sources.

P.M. Why not link bread &amp; potatoes?

J.S. Risky, even if we cd. be sure consumption of flour wdn’t rise above

old levels. Might be 10.000 t. p. wk. extra. Might run out

before Austr. supplies in spring. Danger period cd. be

Feb/March. Safe with another ¼ m. tons e.g. from Russia.

Present stocks about 10 wks. – 11 incldg. flour.

E.B. Need for further study, before decision.

P.M. Can’t you reduce loss on farms, shortage etc?

T.W. Will be lower this year than normal.

Consumption on farms. Has increased. Can’t stop it.

P.M. Trouble if urban dwellers know farmers are feeding to animals etc.

N.B. More hay?

T.W. But less grass.

C.E. Early announcement will cause a run on potatoes. What steps to

collar the pots?

J.S. Controls on clamps &amp; movement already taken.

331

C.E. I’m told there is serious run already.

J.S. Agree – sooner the better.

People have got out of way of war-time economies.

A.W. Waste. Need for public appeal.

G.T. Link bread &amp; potatoes. If we can de-ration bread when we ration

bread, wd. avoid diffy. We shall soon know wtr. we can do

that.

H.W. Agreed. Before we decide can M/F. give appreciation of cereals

future.

Cd. we get it fr. Russia.

Cd. we afford dollar wheat, by more exports.

Offered more on Mon. – not taken into a/c.

N.B. Appeal for economy might check any run on pots.

P.M. { Postpone decision re potatoes until we can see

Agreed. { clearer prospects of de-rationing bread. P.M. We can say we are balancing potatoes &amp; bread.

E.B. Rationing is the easy way – have more diff. ways out been fully

A.B. Public will know pot. rationg. is near – and will lose prodn on

that a/c.

Want Monday’s decisions reviewed.

T.W. Even last year’s crop is 3 m. tons higher that pre-war.

considered.

J.S. Caution in talking of “starch foods” – for sugar is one, &amp; we’ve

decided to cut it &amp; increase stocks.

Discussion re-opened of Monday’s decision re dollar foods.

A.B. Those decisions relied on assumptions re steel imports, further

expansion of our exports to U.S.

H.W. Wd. be ready to gamble on further expansion of exports.

B/payments document prepared v. quickly. Stats. go in to Ty. w’out

Minister’s approval. I may be able to get more out of

timber etc.

H.D. Psychological point. Face the worst at once.

A.B. Whitehall campaign to shock working classes into working.

Don’t believe in storing sugar.

332

A.V.A. Margin of error – what of the drain? Exports: dollar expenditure

in Germany. W’out somethg. in hand, you will be in a v. serious position.

J.S. Accept need of £175 m. saving. But don’t believe order of priorities

is rational. This is being done to shock working-class opinion

into working. That is view of officials.

Monday’s decision to stand. A.B. recording misgiving?

dissent.
