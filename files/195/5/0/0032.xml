C.M. 32(47) 25th March 1947

1. Cyprus.

[Edwards: W.W.

Mc.N. Leak from State Dpt. Paper issued to Congress included statement

Cyprus might be ceded to Greece in certain circs.

Shd. we have P.Q. saying this isn’t policy of U.S. Govt. and doesn’t

affect C.J.’s remit statement in H/C.

State Dpt. have now issued explann.

C.J. Better let it lie. Some divn. of opinion in Cyprus : may come round.

2. Greyhound Racing Bill. Suggest more flexibility. New clause giving power to S/S by Order to

exempt areas or vary hours where satisf. this won’t lead to substantial

interf. with prodn.

C.E. His Dpt’s note didn’t go even as far as that.

J.W. Supported new Clause. Agreed

C.E. Dpts. can give me no evce. tht. it causes loss of prodn. Hence diffies. in H/C.

Pressed to agree to exemptn. for places “mainly holiday resorts”.

Strong oppn. to Bill fr. our supporters.

P.M. Unfortunate Prodn. Dpts. Cdn’t give any evce.

E.Sh. Can’t give figures. But we know tht. absenteeism at pits correspond with racing days in neighbourhood.

.

3. National Service Bill.

W.W. Strong demand for 2 days. Have suggest Mon. and Tues up to 7 p.m. followg. with Traf. Estate Bill.

Cotton Industry : Thursday.

Govt. spokesmen : 2 wd. now suffice. G.A.I. to open : A.V.A. to reply.

W.W. N. Ireland : amendment 123 names thought out of order.

P.M. Why?

C.E. Machinery Bill on border problems. Don’t think anything in it wh. gives N.I. Govt. addl. powers on liberty of subject : that is point at wh. Amendment is aimed.

173

They can’t be prevented from voting v. Bill. even if Amendment isn’t

called.

W.W. Motion today, urging immed. action cd. improve housing in rural

areas.

4. Gold Coast Trials

This Govt. cdn’t defend N.I. Govt. v. allegns. in the Amendment.

Our supporters have tabled amendment “when condns. permit”.

P.M. That is all right.

A.V.A. Nat. Serv. Bill. Cttee on floor?

P.M. Yes.

.

J. C.J. and I will submit memo. to Cab. This must be stopped.

A.V.A. Parlt. right to defend liberty. Shd. they be excluded.

[Exit W.W.

5. Divorce : Reconciliation Machinery

R.S.C. But never bn. any ques. of discussg. prog. or mercy in Parlt.

C.E. V. strong precedents against allowg. it to be discussed.

H.D. Will J. deal with this point too.

.

J. As in memo. Start quietly and see how we go. Approved.

6. Domestic Fuel Rationing.

E.Sh. As in memo.

Legal diffies. now alleged over penalties : because of bringing in, as defence, 50% of consumption in earlier period. Legal : but diff. to prove unless meter reading taken at beginning and end of period of preceding year. Diffy. is therefore one of proof. Prosn must be based on consumption in a given week : can’t prove consumption in corresp. week of last year.

[Enter T.W.

Hope, however, to find solution of this difficulty.

Can we announce before we know answer?

R.S.C. Emphasise reason – give more coal to industry.

174

G.A.I. Will details of scheme come to Cabinet? It is open to criticism.

Not opposed to principle.

Large shedding of load between 8.30 and 10.30 a.m. W’out keeping up restn of hours – rationing instead – we shall have more shedding.

Increase eg of 5 units wd. make a big diffce. to political reactions.

A. Support G.A.I. Don’t like this. Volunteer meter readers – mostly parkers.

Unless big economies secured, this wdn’t be worth while.

Most people don’t understand meters.

Detailed imposn : inquisn. into lives of millions. Administratively impracticable. Will bring minimum diffies. : unpopularity on Govt. for what advantage.

P.M. Small savings I agree : but narrow margins.

Think this will be unpopular : will make miners v. unpopular.

But effect of present scheme is disappearing fast.

E.Sh. Can’t enforce present scheme – and can’t hold it much longer by vol. means.

Know this plan will be unpopular. About 1 m. may be open to prosecn.

and plan may therefore break down.

Can’t estimate what savings it secures.

C.E. B. Ben shdn’t have bn. re-lighted. [Exit C.E.

P.M. Problem of this plan : enforcement. V. diff. to understand this scheme with its variations for children etc. – people coming and going.

H.D. Can confirm prosecns. to flagrant cases. We so agreed.

P.M. Are we going to say that in H/C.?

H.D. Cd. say adminn. wdn’t be oppressive : but (positively) flagrant excess will be severely dealt with.

E.Sh. Then how will you define “flagrant?

R.S.C. Don’t. May prosecute for large or persistent use. cf. speed limit.

J. Enforcemt. of law depends on support of public opinion. Courts won’t enforce v. public opinion. Consider a voluntary scheme.

R.S.C. Industry! 600.000 t. saved this summer means 22 coupons or 31 most

winter. This is a measure of gravity of situation.

G.A.I. Extra staff : far more than 2.000 will be required. 175

Gas and electricity accounts must be sent out simultaneously – aren’t

now.

T.W. I’m being charged more for consuming less electricity.

People are ready to co-operate.

R.S.C. No : they are awaiting compulsion.

If you go on with no suggns :- a) Vol. meter readers. They must be

taught. “Youth clubs” begin at 12 : can’t get anyone under 16 to do

this. Inaccessibility of meters.

P.L. a) Diffy. of enforcement b) Danger of making a law and not

A. Is this scheme administratively practicable?

E.Sh. I have always preferred existg. scheme – tightened up as necessary.

R.S.C. No evidence in favour of this “hunch”.

G.T. Experience of enforcing restns. on bldg. materials. This is worse.

Depends on getting public opinion to support it – not enforcement.

Differing circs. of diff. houses.

Better to run a vol. appeal for 50% saving.

enforcing

it.

Feeling in H/C. wd. run v. high.

P.M. Enforcement is real diffy.

R.S.C. How many prosns for bread rationing?

J.S. V. few.

A.G. But diff. scheme.

A.V.A. What of consequential control of paraffin? Paraffin coke? Will rich

find a way round this?

Brings all law into disrepute.

A.G. Opposition wd. go for this. Wd. ask how you will enforce. Will have to admit order under D.R. Demand for a day to debate the Order.

J. Army of bureaucrats – worth the savings secured?

G.A.I. Diffies. to housewives.

E.Sh. If present restns. continued, wd. have to be extended to gas.

J.S. Wd. 35 units allow people to cook meals? Can’t really defend a scheme wh. won’t allow that.

176

P.M. Then you wdn’t get the economy required.

E.Sh. Might reduce it from 1½ m. to 1 m. tons.

P.M. Wd. ths scheme w’out penalties be better or worse than the present? E.Sh. Continue present restns. economy drive : prosecute flagrant offenders

for waste of fuel.

H.D. Ques. for immediate decision : is there to be some element of

compulsn.

Cd. we not say at once we are considering a scheme : there must be some compulsion in it. Let E.Sh. then discuss with undertakers.

R.S.C. Can’t say that when we have no idea what scheme.

P.M. Must face the real diffy. of enforcement.

E.Sh. Say : present scheme continues : discussg. with undertakers, can’t say what will emerge : aim at 2 m. savings.

R.S.C. Said precisely that in H/C. 2 wks ago.

Effect of exemplary penalties in selected cases and in all rationing schemes.

P.M. But this is essentially different from any other rationing scheme.

A.V.A. Try appeal and threat of rationing.

P.M. Cab. won’t accept this scheme. Better say we have examined v. many : decided all involves man power excessively and diffies. of enforcement. Will rely therefore on present restns. extended to gas plus publicity and anything expedient wh. can be devised.

R.S.C. Record my profound disagreement.

P.M. Let E.Sh. draft announcement on lines of x/. and submit to Cab. Thursday.

7. Coal : Imports from U.S.A. and S. Africa.

E.Sh. Saw U.S. Amb. Promised to cable his Govt.

Later told me he thought it wd. have to go thro’ E.C.O.

But was v. anxious to help.

A. Waterson provided help. Cd. increase by 2 m. tons : but want trucks from us.

177

8. Floods : Relief and Compensation.

T.W. Cttee mtg. H/C. 2.30 p.m. Hope to confine them to urgent remedial action.

Want P.M. directive for priority for a few weeks for supplies, equipment for drainage authies.

Diffies. in obtaing. pipes Diffy. over t. or r. for the Cttee : confining it to emerg. methods of

restoring land.

P.M. I wanted it to go wide – over food prodn. as result of this situation.

Don’t want it confined to flood damage or areas so damaged.

Compensation. a) Govt. will be expected to provide something.

b) Lord Mayor is receiv. cheques and wants open Fund.

a) shd. precede b). Want a scheme prepared. Must draw a clear line.

H.D. P.Q. by Piratin: furniture and clothing. Got Dpts. together under Ty. to draw a line. Remember much is covered by insurance – tho’ it won’t cover all cases or all cost. Will say today : we are examing. urgently how far covered by insurance and how far Govt. must supplement.

R.S.C. L. Mayor’s Fund and supplement fr. Govt. Fund have a technique for handling these cases. Why shdn’t Govt. subscribe £1 m. to Fund.

M/H. We shall be setting a new precedent. cf. Salford, who last year put large sums. L.A.’s will spend much here. Shall have to consider, if any voted monies, a grant-in-aid to l.a.’s

J.W. Not floods only – frozen sheep, too. And shan’t know till May/June extent of disaster.

H.D. A vast operation is envisaged.

E.Sh. Will pay a dividend anyway. Believe Govt. must administer.

P.M. Machinery : can County Cos. help?

T.W. Yes. We are collectg. informn. from them.

P.M. Grants or loans?

T.W. Prob. both.

A.V.A. Domestic relief via L. Mayor’s Fund }

Working capital via Govt. }

178

M/H. And grant in aid to l.a.’s many of whom have taken action already.

Agreed: H.D. to make statement today at end Ques.

H.D. to consult Lord Mayor.

A.G. Read report of mtg. held y’day at H.O. on relief measures. Dpt. coordination.

R.S.C. Pumps and pipes : someone will have to be empowered to requisition

it.

Govt. realise heavy losses to indiv. and l.a.’s. Are considering how Govt. can best assist farmers : also those l.a.’s who have incurred expendre. in relief of distress. Understand L. Mayor’s Fund being opened – Govt. subscribing £1 m. hope for generous support.

Agreed : Gardiner (M/Ag.) to have such power.

9. Coal : Five Day Week.

P.M. Can’t do other than agree.

H.D. Yes : but shall watch effect on output and re-open it if output falls.

E.Sh. Condns. are stringent.

3.9 m. produced last week. Agreed.
