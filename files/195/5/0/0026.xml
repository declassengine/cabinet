C.M. 26(47) 6th March 1947

1. India : H/Commons Debate.

H.D. W.S.C. has bn. looking at W.E. etc. on Indian debt. May spk. intemperately about it.

But we shdn’t repel the argument itself. Esp. now Austr. and N.Z. have offered remission.

No progress by Eady. Proposed Ministers to discuss in Apl. (here).

A.V.A. Has bn. raised in debate last night.

We mustn’t stop ourselves fr. takg. firm line in negotns.

We shd. spk. generously of India’s war effort.

R.S.C. Say its irrelevant to present issue.

P.M. Sent lr. to W.S.C. saying Raisman didn’t mean we had dropped this idea.

Only speech y’day worth answering is J.A.’s

P.L. First half of that speech is diff. to answer. Second is nonsense.

P.M. On 1st half : no one supposes these things can all be settled in advance in detail.

With reasonable spirit, all can be left to work itself out.

P.L. Not the Army : no answer to that.

A.V.A. agreed. Nicholas &amp; Andamans :

P.M. Stall on this in debate.

P.M. Make it clear tht. we accept our obligns. to the Services.

R.S.C. Yes : who pays it back afterwards is for argument.

H.D. Don’t pre-judge compensn. for those willing to go on in India.

R.S.C. Accept the obligns. : avoid the details “which are now under discussion”.

Men serving in India can be assured they won’t be let down.

2. Parliament.

W.W. Business for next week.

144

A. H/Lds. Civic Restaurants Bill. How to get licence?

P.M. Agreed.

But when in premises belonging to a Church. Can these premises be made subject of a special exemption?

J. Leave it to licensing bench.

P.M. Agreed

3. Civil Service Man Power.

P.M. Note the memo. I circulated (? Ty. circular).

C.E. Will Ministers see that officials collaborate.

H.D. Must get the total down. May have to make arbitrary cut.

C.E. That wd. of course be blind injustice.

4. Germany : Socialisation of Ruhr Industries.

P.M. Announced delay because repns. fr. W. European countries.

No change in Policy.

[Exit A.V.A.

[Enter Barnes

5. Electricity Supply Nationalisation Bill. S.I.M. Cttee. favoured this, except M/T.

P.M. Object to compensatg. those who have soaked consumers to benefit ratepayers.

E.Sh. Don’t defend compensg. on that ground.

Accept principle of no compn. for transfer of assets fr. one public authy. to another.

But they have a case on income tax set off. superannn. funds etc.

Some concession reqd. because ⅔ of our supporters on Cttee wd. support amendment providing for some form of compn.

Cdn’t M/T. apply similar system for municipal transport.

H.D. We considered and thought Bill fair. I was ready however, to buy off opposn. for £5 M. Check this in on grounds of severance only. This wd. help M/T. because less severance on transport and takg. over more gradually.

B. Am I covered then?

145

H.D. Wd. support you in resistg. any claim save for l.a.’s. No severance

except for l.a.’s.

B. I have managed to beat this off.

C.E. Severance claim has never bn. made on earlier occasions eg L.G. Act 1929.

It shd. mean less work in l.a.’s office because subordinate staff wh. is redundant shd. be transferred. This = means of m’taining salaries of high offls. Better way is to let their salaries be reduced and compensate them for loss of emollients.

If severance is admitted here, it will apply to municipal transport – gas

Regional water boards etc., V. dangerous precedent.

E.Sh. On superannuation funds, there is a case.

G.T. In reply to C.E. this is different because these are trading services.

On these 3 points now raised by E.Sh. there is unanimous support from Labour councils. We shall have to do it and if need be in Transport too.

J. Cdn’t you set aside £5 M. and pay it to hard cases?

P.M. It’s not the hard cases (good boys) who are squealing.

B. Posn. varies fr. one l.a. to another. None has made out a case.

P.L. Discriminatory system is necessary to ensure tht. compensn. goes the right way.

E.Sh. All are affected by my 3 points : I propose to share the £5 M. acc. to size of undertaking.

P.M. That doesn’t go to real point. The bigger the l.a. the smaller the influence of electricity undertaking on its financial posn.

This sweetener may turn sour in the month.

P’pone until after I’ve met l.a.’s Friday.

Agreed : defer decision until next week.

E.Sh. I have to meet our people on Monday.

P.M. Say we are working out a formula : and there will be some compensn. – a million or two.

Agreed.

[Exit E.Sh.

6. Shipping for Migrants to Australia.

P.M. Is this policy right?

146

R.S.C. Timing is v. awkward a) because econ. sitn. and manpower

b) because these ships are dollar

earners.

A. Long time since we signed this agreement.

Then we’ve cut down Austr. figures.

Rule out Aquitania and they come down to ¼ of original demand.

M/L. think we can afford these numbers.

P.L. Cd. be used for Indian lift on return journey.

H.D. Awkward to draw back now, when Austr. have just given us £25 m.

R.S.C. Not going back on policy : only timing.

A. Have bn. cutting down. It’s now down to 6.900.

Agreed : omitting Aquitania.

[Exit Barnes

7. Electoral Legislation.

C.E. Ch. Whip supports this.

P.M. Agree to Cttee : proposed t. of reference.

R.S.C. Add our Party policy – consider that too.

8. International Labour Conference

C.E. Let us have unrestricted t. of r.

P.M. V. well : “taking account of …..” Reports.

H.D. Why so negative about Business Votes and University Votes.

P.M. Announced composn. of Cttee.

C.E. Learn to call in other colleagues?

P.M. Yes.

.

G.A.I. As in memo. Principles already approved by Cabinet.

H.D. We are delaying decision. Basis : concede the principle but this isn’t

the time to do it. Don’t like now

J. What about Equal Pay (p.6)? giving same money for less work.

147

C.J. No diffy. in stalling on this at I.L. Conferences.
