[Enter Hall, 1st Sea Lord. B.

3. Palestine : Illegal Immigration.

P.M. As in minute from 1st Lord.

H. President Warfield now in Genoa, may carry 5.000.

Diffies a) number of bilateral deals : may be used v. us in future.

b) practical.

C.N.S. Longer you have for interceptns. the better, with fast ships.

Diversion is different. When we get possn. they sabotage the engines. 231

If we towed them away fr. Palestine, they wd. make trouble. And with 5.000 aboard we shd. have to put aboard a v. large guard.

On a) above : these may whittle away genl. ruling v. inviolability of high seas. With U.S. we had formal Treaty in preamble of which we reaffirmed genl. principle fr. which this was an exception.

J. From legal angle, wd. sooner not. There may be actions.

Makes no difference. legally wthr. it’s done by Treaty or by agreement.

C.N.S. We may be establishing a precedent wh. will work against us in future.

Long term I believe this is unwise.

Agreed : E.B. to consider first with A.V.A., H. and C.J. 4. Coal : Allocations to Industry

E.B. Italians are subject to U.S. pressure to put little diffies. in the way.

[Exit H. and C.N.S.

[Enter J.W. and Key .

A.B. Housing lost priority to fuel industries. Didn’t object to that.

Para. 3 of R.S.C.’s memo, rejected the selective policy. Para. 9

proposed 86% of 1947 requirements equally actual summer

requirements of 1946. Was not intended to discriminate. I was content

to get 86% of current requirements of bldg. industries. All Dpts. so

interpreted it. But R.S.C. now proposes tht. each particular industry

shd. have what it consumed last summer. This makes a difference of

548.000 tons. not 1½ m. as stated by R.S.C. last time.

Had R.S.C. realised effects of what was proposed? Shd. he not have

made that clear.

R.S.C. A.B. starts from 2.25. Winter use in fact was 1.81. Assumes an

increase of nearly 4.

Another calculn. = £50 p. ton of coal. } £100 per ton of coal

P.M. Figures show 86% wd. be 2.13. Winter consumption 1.81.

Far heavier cut than for other industries. Some case for adjustment.

Decided to take a risk in stocking for the winter.

Effects on bldg. programme.

If this adjustment made, means loss of 50 m. p. month in exports : drop to below 100% of 1936. With present balance/payments we can’t survive on that basis. We must have the exports : we can’t have the houses.

A.B. Export drive makes internal and external crisis endemic.

R.S.C. Every million off exports means redn. of imports or another U.S. loan. Lose £200 m. exports with 20 m. tons of coal.} i.e. between £50 and 232

P.M. What exports will you get from this cut on bldg?

R.S.C. Depends on industry. Nil on steel. Engineering mainly export : also chemicals etc., the cut will tend to fall on the export sector, in most of these industries.

Estimate : 50 m. difference to b) payments.

A.V.A. But some exports come fr. bldg. materials industries.

E.B. Not enough attentn. to output p. man. Housing will make a big contn. to that. Find this ½ m. tons somehow – by improvisation – sooner than let housing down.

R.S.C. We’ve bn. doing all this improvisation already.

We’ve taken a big risk in allocatg. 24.3 m. tons to industry.

Ques remaining now is allocn. w’in industry : building or exports.

A.B. Doubt if some of the other industries cd. now take 86%

R.S.C. Why? What industry wd. fail to get back to last summer’s level?

Loss of exports estimated at £10 m. a month – off average total of £90 m.

E.Sh. Export of cement. If that is to be cut, the coal cd. be used for home consumption.

2½ tons of coal used last year for export of cement. My estimate.

G.A.I. This cut wd. put us back years in training bldg. force. Unions have now demanded closing of training centres.

K. Means loss of 70/80.000 houses on p’mme, in 1948 as well as 1947.

R.S.C. That applies equally to textile industries.

E.B. Will bldg. industries actually use more than about 350.000 t.? Tell them they must manage on that figure.

E.E.B. H.D. wd. oppose taking coal fr. industries makg. for export.

Loss of £50 m. exports is v. serious. Because we must avoid coming to end of loans before we have reached equilibrium.

P.M. But unemplt. in bldg. industry.

R.S.C. Unemplt. elsewhere equally.

A.B. Gravity of reducing housing to lowest priority –by relatg. supplies to period before expansion. The 56% global means 60% for bldg. industries.

P.M. Wd. sooner ask miners to work an extra day.

233

E.B. Psychol. effect of houses standing half finished, all over the country.

E.Sh. We have taken a good many risks already on coal prodn.

I wd. give bldg. industries their demand, subject to review.

P.M. Can we add the 548.000 to the total for industry and give it to bldg. materials.

R.S.C. For industries generally : consumption as last summer.

For bldg. industries : “ “ “ “ + 548.000 tons.

5. International Allocation of Timber.

R.S.C. As in memo.

E.B.’s view. Doubtful about that. Wd. break up internatl.- collaboration in commodity control : unfortunate at time of Geneva conference.

E.B. I don’t now oppose this. Want to explain my attitude.

We were being asked for steel rails. Thought this wd. be diverted away from hard currency. Told now, however, this wd. mean we cd. force hard currency timber on other countries.

Don’t want to break E.E.C.E.

But H. Wilson was being v. hard pressed by R. And became a ques. of currency. 1941 Agreement due to be paid ’48 – a most critical plan fr. Ty. angle. Unwise therefore to throw this away.

R.S.C. We can’t barter the 1941 Agreement w’out v. serious thought. Believe now they aren’t pressing this.

P.M. O.K. so long as we see tht. other countries take their share of dollar timber.

B. Heavy shipping commitment for hauling timber fr. U.S. Want to be consulted on any adjustment makg. for more hauls from U.S.

[Exit Key and B.

6. Iron and Steel Nationalisation Bill.

J.W. Intended to defer consultn. with Fedn. Diff. to defer, now Press statements made. Want now to see Duncan, tell him broad decision and invite their technical comments. Two members of Steel Board are on Fedn.

A. Want to see the ease for nationalising the industry.

P.M. We’ve already authorised Minister to consult T. Unions.

Serious leakages.

234

Agreed: J.W. to inform Duncan in confidence : decision to bring under p. ownership an appropriate area of the industry by purchasing shares of certain companies : and ask for any technical comments they may have.

H.M. Add with a view to re-organisation of industry. It’s not ordinary socialisation and we needn’t say so.

P.M. Keep your announcement to minimum.

7. Poland. [Exit J.W. and Barnes.

E.B. Finance Agreement and General Trade Agreement.

New P.M. (Soc. Democrat) urged me to ratify the first quickly. It is

ready – as is a Trade agreement.

Read proposed draft telegrams to Warsaw.

Promised him I wdn’t make compensn. for B. interests (natn) a bargain v. this. But he volunteered to settle the compn. ques. if these Agreements concluded.

Wd. announce Fin. Agreement on 5/5: and compensn. on 7/5. Simultaneous tho’ not conditional.

Polish Displaced Persons. Believe we shall be able to relieve our Zone in Germany substantially.

Agreed.

8. Germany : Fusion of British and U.S. Zone

They will now take almost anyone back – no pol. test – amnesty v. wide.

.

Bound up with level of industry.

A.B. When will our insistence on non-interference with socialisation policy

be formulated in document to U.S.A.

E.B. Socialist Govts. of Belgium and France don’t want socialisation in

Ruhr!

U.S. recognise it now, so long as in Land Govts.

E.B. Don’t believe this will be settled in Berlin. Shall have to take it up soon in Washington.

Must discuss with them and Luxembourg.

Agreed.

235

9. Dockers’ Strike.

G.A.I. Sc. Union recommended return. But Branches have voted in favour of

going on.

Now a secret ballot this p.m. May go well.
