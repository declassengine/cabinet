C.M. 39(47) 24th April 1947

1. Home Food Production.

[Enter W.W.

T.W. As in memo.

P.M. How far will price increases or acreage payments be effective. A. v. indiscriminate method will benefit those who don’t need it as will those who do.

T.W. All over country season is late. No means of discriminating, anyhow, since all are suffering from late sowing.

J. Cdn’t you fix a date?

T.W. “Fortunate” areas suffered more from frost.

E.Sh. Fix a global sum and let H.D. and T.W. settle a means.

H.D. Trust T.W. to work it out.

This is biggest dollar saving. Prefer to risk indiscriminate benefit than more dollars. Wd. have preferred acreage payment method alone rather than incurred prices. But disposed to let it go : on understanding that it’s exceptional.

J.S. Any inducement to sow wd. suit us.

A. I prefer price increases : don’t like acreage payments.

Leave it to Minister to spend the £7 m. as best he can.

A.B. Unsatisf. tht. we can’t find a keener instrument to promote officially among farmers. Can’t we have another shot at marginal prodn. ques.

T.W. It’s insoluble.

H.D. Save by Socialism.

Memo approved.

A. a) Appendix. (d) Can more be done on this? Wd. meet agitation.

b) Housing. (i) M/H. haven’t bn. willing to gain farm hands first claim on rural houses. They shd. have it. Cd. this be reconsidered anyway for next 2 yrs. Only way of increasing labour force.

(ii) Re-conditioning cottages. Much can be done. Wd. avoid pressure for new houses. Consider (h) (v) of Appendix. with more sympathy from M/H.

A.B. b)(i) as it stands wd. cause political storm. Rlway porter with 4 tubercular children : is childless farmhand to be preferred?

214

We are working on a scheme, to bring in C.W.A. Cttees. with Housing Cttees. Can’t ques. absolute priorities – for farm hands or miners. We can’t select tenants.

b)(ii) Farmer can recondition now : he can get licence and materials. What we want is grant.

[Exit C.E., E.Sh., T.W.

Agreed : A. to discuss with A.B. &amp; T.W.

2. Parliament.

W.W. Business in H/Commons.

3. Anglo. Egyptian Treaty. [Exit W.W. 4. National Service Bill

P.M. Amb. in Cairo hasn’t yet seen Nokrashi. P’pone until next week.

.

[Enter Service Ministers

A.V.A. a) Period of Reserve Service.

Have discussed with R.S.C. : he wdn’t object to 75 days.

A.V.A. R.A.F. and R.N. can perhaps make out such a case.

R.N. want 28 days in alternate years.

Tory Amendments will be proposed for increase.

P.M. Can’t justify this on quid pro quo. Must be able to prove its special training that is required.

Main argument is, however, loss of 6 mos. with Colours.

P.M. But [particular object of 18 months was advanced collective training]. This won’t replace it.

F.J.B. Purpose of Bill : a) get nos of well trained men who can be rapidly deployed in an emergency and b) (for some time) to meet peace time commitments in Germany (those further afield can’t be met by 12 mos. service).

So far as concerns a) under 18 mos. a man wd. be with operational unit for 12 mos. And even then we wanted 105 days with Reserve.

We wd. like 90 now : but it must be more than 60. Many will be able to commute camp to evening duty.

P.M. That argument means admitting man is inadequately trained in 12 mos.

and tht. Reserve service is not refresher but completing training. Then

you are open to criticism for reducing the 18 mos. to 12.

215

A.B. In Cttee. cd. have bargained one v. other. Can’t do that now we

conceded other ques. earlier and separately.

F.J.B. Overall includg. travelling time and Sundays.

G.A.I. What is 15 days I’m being asked.

G.A.I. Week’s holiday with pay industry : means 3 weeks, or 4 if 15 days weren’t inclusive. Much criticism already. Can’t w’stand objns. to any increase. Much discussion with industry needed re timing, so as to avoid takg. men away when industry at full stretch. N.B. P.M. has exposed diffy. of Service proposal.

H. Our responsibility is to produce efficient Services. We can’t do that

with 12 months. We want longer Reserve period to make up for that.

We must give some sea training. Hence our plan for 28 days in

alternative years totalling 84. Few men cd. do evening training in R.N.

A.G. Parly. angle. Promised 2 days for Cttee originally, but have had to extend to 3. Shall have diff. time anyway : if this goes in, we shall have to go to 4.

But some of n.s. men will leave after 12 mos. with no operational experce.

Trying to reduce this. But in most vital branches, we can’t give full training in 12 mos.

P.M. That means : call him up for longer Reserve service in 1st year. It is flexible. But that is dangerous.

N.B. 15 days at a time wd. mean Reserve wd. be over in 4 years.

P.M. This is argument for 18 months. Cdn’t have done sea training in Reserve period under Bill as introduced.

A.B. But R.N. isn’t relying on conscripts anyway.

H. Shall need them for reserves.

A.V.A. i) R.N. sea training. War experience shows they can get 6 mos. sea training out of 12. And some sea work in 21 day period in Reserve.

(ii) R.A.F. diffies. can to some extent be met if there is proper job selection acc. to skill : peace time traders.

(iii) Army : real danger is posn. in 1950/52 on run-down, if vol. recruitment doesn’t go too well, and commitments don’t fall as C.I.G.S. assumed.

Desirable, but not essential, to have Reserve training: as cpd. with importance of getting principle accepted on Statute book.

216

P.M. Have C.O.S. been by passed?

A.V.A. Discussed with P.P.O.’s

P.M. View of Cabinet is no amendment.

H.D. But wdn’t it be prudent to hear C.O.S. at Defence Cttee.

P.M. No disclosure of views of C.O.S. But Def. Cttee shd. hear their views.

J. Cab. must balance needs of Forces and industry. No use having strong Forces : economic weakness. We don’t need C.O.S. to tell us that a man is battle trained in 18 mos. then 12.

A.B. Services have already given technical advice thro; P.P.O’s and Service Ministers.

P.M. At Def. Cttee C.O.S. can hear considns. which influence Ministers.

P.M. Provisional conclns. today : to be discussed at Def. Cttee and confirmed formally by Cab. afterwards.

H. Can Services have discretion to call up for 28 days, w’in even 60.

G.T. You cdn’t impose 28 days. Wd. have to be voluntary.

H. Wd. be willing to consult employer.

P.M. This hangs with the other. Can’t concede it.

b) Period of Service for men called up before 1.1.49. Politically, fear we can’t avoid some shading off.

Last 6 mos. of ’48 wd. have to start tapering off.

A.V.A. Put arguments both ways.

Can’t give detailed promised to individuals.

F.J.B. Wd. favour general pledge – not longer than new conscripts.

P.M. Will consider this in Defence Cttee.

c) Dartmouth.

P.M. Will decision be taken before Bill comes into Cttee.

H. Diff. because educational standard. Want to preserve 3 methods of

entry : modified condns. for entry via D’mouth.

P.M. Why take so long?

H. Hope to decide by end of next week.

217

A.V.A. Cd. it be settled by Def. Cttee. next week.

d) Further Education.

F.J.B. Can’t do so much in 12 months as in 18.

[Exit Services Ministers

G.T. But we still accept oblign. to do all we can.

Don’t talk too large on this. Don’t “lead the retreat”.

P.M. Don’t imply we shd. have kept the 18 months.

[Re-enter E.Sh.

5. Ration Changes.

J.S. Sugar increase – to compensate for reductions in tea, meat and (now) flour.

Sugar increase – will break total gloom and assist production.

P.M. Jam on the pill was secret of Woolton’s success.

Starting biscuit exports is folly.

H.D. Balance/Payments W. Party Rpt. will come up v. soon. May mean

further restns. on food imports next year. I believe best course wd. be to

discuss this ques. then

P.M. That is reasonable.

J.S. Don’t p’pone until we discuss import p’mme : for sugar is bought and dollars involved only on basis tht. we cd. sell it or store it for years. It wd. be mistake to do that. Enlarged sugar wd. enable us to resume luxury exports (sweets, sweet biscuits) which had to be cut short a year ago.

P.M. Folly to re-start that.

J.S. V. well : tho’ nutritionally it wdn’t matter.

Increasing sugar when decreasing meat and tea is wise.

. Don’t announce this until we know the full

picture.

Wd. never suggest re-sale. But might be wise to hold stocks.

E.Sh. What if you had to reduce ration next winter or spring?

J.S. Can give assurance now that we shan’t have to reduce. Covered for ’47 and ’48 by stocks held and/or bought ahead.

I must announce tea this weekend. Don’t want therefore to wait for balance/payments discussion. Willing to p’pone announcement re meat until afterwards. 218

A. Tea. Woolton is to attack in H/Lords. Recognise need for price increase. But is it essential to reduce supply? He will say there is so much tea that you needn’t ration at all. Hope I shall be provided with effective reply.

J.S. We have bought in bulk about 50% of last years’ purchase at higher

price. For the rest India and Ceylon insist on buying at auctions. Prices

there are so high I wdn’t. U.S. and M/E. are buying and when they are

satisfied prices will drop and I hope to come in then.

J.S. This is included in my figures.

P.M. Can’t we hope to get something out of Java.

A.B. Have Doms. any tea stocks enabling them to under-write our position.

J.S. No : have got all we can get out of that – eg. Australian stocks in India.

A.V.A. Why not restore Mincing Lane?

J.S. Govts. have decreed tht. auctions shall be held in India and Ceylon : and refused to countenance restoration of Mincing Lane.

In these circs. it wd. be folly not to conserve our supplies. No M/F. wd. cut tea ration if he cd. help it.

Fundamental cause = political change in India and Ceylon.

A. Cd. we have statement of stocks and how long they will last at ration?

Is there same amount of tea in the world?

Is the high price artificial – a gamble : can we call their bluff.

J.S. That is what we are doing – holding off buying at auction to force price down.

Stocks 89 m. lbs = under 3 months on present ration. But long pipeline.

Bought 260 m. lbs. for delivery over next 12 months. 425 m = total need.

P.M. Aren’t you jumping too soon.

L. In Calcutta much tea bought by M/F. in warehouses wh. can’t be shipped because of dock strike.

Working stock : experts say 16 wks : I believe 10 wks. minimum.

J. Br. tea cos. Why not deal direct with them.?

J.S. Are doing : it’s from them we have bought in bulk.

A.V.A. Never supplied much to us even pre-war.

A.B. Is the free element speculation on price alone or quantity too? 219

J.S. We bought 4/7ths of world supply pre-war: if we hold off the market too long there mayn’t be the quantity.

C.J. Ceylon Govt. are anxious to recoup losses on rubber. Can we explore

offsetting the prices. We might then get more bulk purchase of tea. Cd.

approach “Guinakullita” (phonetic!)

L. Shd. M. raise this with Nehru and lift it above trade level?

A.B. A statement by W. tht. there is plenty of tea wd. help us to break price.

H.D. If no need to cut tea, no need to increase sugar, at once. This confirms my recommn. that all this should await b/payments discussion.

J.S. My advisers believe a cut wd. depress prices.

A.B. Advised p’ponement. Anyway better to await warmer weather.

J.S. Cuts wdn’t come anyway until June/July.

Leave it pro tem to commercial tactics.

Agreed : wait.

J. Take opportunity of saying we are trying to increase African prodn. of tea. P.M. I shall need figures to convince me of need to reduce tea ration.

C.J. Cd. give publicity to what we have done.

6. Iron and Steel Nationalisation Bill.

J.W. Scope : as in memo.

Method : disadvantages in taking 75% of all company shares : concluded it wd. be better to buy whole companies.

Retention of existing company structure.

Purchase of shares at market value will be cheapest method. Care in instructg. tribunal to ensure that unquoted shares don’t get too high a price.

A.B. Share value of highly centralised industry is not best method for us to acquire.

J.W. Analysis of assets wdn’t support that view.

P.M. Diff. to justify this “mixed” method.

220

J. Steel industry : few up to date plants; many obsolescent; some obsolete. Pre-war cost £120 m. of Hermann Goering Works : and in unlimited competn. they wd. have knocked B. Steel endwise.

Need for large integrated plants. When these are built, the obsolescent plants will become obsolete. It is these which we now buy under this scheme : and our reconstn. then makes them useless.

If we try this method, I shd. recommend buying 51% interest in the efficient firms.

In my view, this view is fundamentally unsound.

A. If we are to do this, shd, do it quickly.

Some of these firms are v. efficient.

a) I want to see the case for doing this at all.

We shall be accused of taking over efficient businesses.

b) What incentive to industry to go on puttg. their backs into their work, when they have bn. taken over.

47 “ “ “ “ £ 85 m. “ only quoted.

Alternatively, have a big national company and let it knock out the

obsolescent by competition.

J.W. If we want to nationalise basic sections we must buy the assets or the

shares. Valuation of assets = impossible because severance. eg Steward

and Lloyds from iron ore to tubes. Can’t isolate the basic element. If

therefore forced to take whole cf. Stewart &amp; Lloyds easier way is to

buy shares.

How do we know we shan’t waste money by buying inflated shares?

Have tried to check.

I. V. difficult project. Haven’t listened to earlier discns. Come fresh to it.

a) No reason to acquire even 75%. We cd. get all we need by 51%. We cd. go on later and acquire more if needed. Much cheaper.

b) 245 classes of security with £176 m. capital.

Great delay in selling price of these, by arbitration.

c) Para. 9 of Heads : seems inconsistent with x/. in para. 12.

d) Why not 1.7.45. via 1.7.46. para 21. For some firms, after Election and before end ‘45 entered into agreements.

E.Sh. a) Same problem in mining of efficiency, obsolescence, obsolete.

We referred to Tribunal, who fixed a global amount.

That wd. be much simpler here. Wd. avoid inequity.

b) Retentions of company structure. “Natn ” no doubt must vary from one industry to another. But public ownership thro’ a Bd. owning the property is common to all we’ve done so far. Company structure remaining, under existing names, is hardly consistent with our ideas of public ownership. V. diff. politically.

I wd. therefore recommend valuation of assets by independent Tribunal and then appoint a Board competent to determine own structure.

221

P.M. Even suppose shares aren’t now inflated, what of effect of new big development by Govt.

J.W. These comg. developmts. are well known and reflected in market value of shares of existg. cos.

P.M. Then what about the unquoted shares? Many of these cos. may be put right out.

J.W. That’s why we must have Tribunal valuation – for those.

A.B. State action to support big monopoly plants has increased value of all steel shares.

H.D. Cttee. cd. look again at a) basis of compensation and instrns. to Tribunal includg. net maintainable revenue. b) Wthr. 51% of shares is enough.

But those points are not inconsistent with main heads of Bill.

R.S.C. agrees this is best method.

Discussion to be resumed : Monday 28/4/47.
