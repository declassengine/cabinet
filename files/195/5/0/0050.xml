C.M. 50(47). 23rd May, 1947.

India: Constitutional Position.

P.M. Secrecy. No gossip – especially at Margate.

when this recognised, press claim for division of Punjab &amp;

Will be discussed with Indian leaders on 2nd June.

wd. be succession States to which power wd. be transferred.

Indians of diffies of “independence”. Patel &amp; Nehru now asking

therefore will prob. now make a volte-face &amp; say he doesn’t

Congress method of putting this across their followers:

Also in Bengal realisation of diffies of division. Thinking in terms of

Summary of conversations with Viceroy.

Cabinet Mission Plan. Groups. Muslims have not, however,

collaborated in C.A. &amp; their attitude is also making

Interim Govt’s task v. difficult.

Clear now that C. Mission Plan won’t work &amp; tht. we shall have

to hand over power to more than one authority. All Parties

in India now recognise Partition is inevitable: but Hindus,

Bengal. Diffy. over non-viable areas e.g. N.W.F.

This plan for Partition results fr. discussions: &amp; acceptable to the

Parties so far as anything ever is in India.

Explained main features of plan. Division of Bengal &amp; Punjab:

referendum in N.W.F: Sind (almost wholly Muslim). These

Indian States: many Hindu States have adhered to C.A.

Mysore, Travancor, Hyderabad are standing out &amp; askg. for

incorpn in Commonwealth.

To have part of India in &amp; part out of Commonwealth wd. be v.

difficult.

Sikhs: 4 m. scattered thro’ Punjab: in Hindu half 2 m. Sikhs, but

nearly 2 m. in Muslim half. They may fight. Posn v. dangerous.

Communal massacres spreading from Bengal to Bihar &amp; Punjab

&amp; N.W.F. Posn is v. explosive.

Indian Army: organised on non-communal basis.

Finance: all-India structure: f. trade, customs etc.

Bengal centred on Calcutta: no real centre for W. Bengal if divided.

Last 2 wks. or so, situation changing because growing feeling of many

for immediate Dom. status for Hindustan &amp; Pakistan. Jumal

want to have Dom. status.

independence before June ’48 &amp; right to secede.

Dom. States for independent Bengal – on basis of joint

electorates for Hindus &amp; Muslims. Sylhet in these circs. wd.

have to stay with Assam because if joined to united Bengal wd.

upset their communal balance.

Pakistan will be moth-eaten: but thoughtful Muslims wd. rather be

alone in Sind Desert than with Hindus. Boundary

Commissions ……..

268

Two or three Doms. with separate Govrs. Genl.

Unlikely they will want to secede if they reach this posn.

States: Paramountcy wd. be surrendered: they wd. have to make

their arrangements with Pakistan or Hindustan.

amend it in its appln to India: in its appln in U.K. it wd. remain.

Can’t offer Dom. status w’out guarantee we cd. implement it.

M. will try to get agreement. If both sides reject, will have to start

again. If Muslim’s reject, we shd. go on &amp; impose it – incldg.

Dom. status for Pakistan.

How achieve legn before end/summer? Complexities. Proposed Bill

conferring Dom. status on our one or two or three Indias: annex

G/India Act so far as applicable: empower new Indian Govts to

Short Bill on these lines required as soon as possible.

Therefore saw Opposn leaders who have promised to facilitate

legn so it wd. pass in matter of days before we rise for autumn.

Essence is timing.

Present diffies of Viceroy. Hindu &amp; Muslim Ministers abusing powers

for Party ends. Interim period may therefore require duplicate

Govts.

Need for speed.

Splitting of Indian Army. Both sides want to keep enough B. officers

and civilians too to enable them to carry on. This is one reason

why they favour now Dom. status. One of Sikh diffies – for

Sikhs &amp; Muslim Punjabis live by serving as soldiers.

In spite of diffies, this is most hopeful possibility fr. India for some

time.

Viceroy believes some bloodshed inevitable. Need to check it by most

resolute action incldg. tanks &amp; aircraft. Interim Govt. have

agreed to this. Agreed.

Position of India Office &amp; S. of S. Right way to proceed is to make

D.O. an Office of Commonwealth Relations covering I. &amp; B.

&amp; also pres. Ceylon. This will need consultn with Doms.

Propose consultn with Doms. on the Indian issues.

H.M. King?

P.M. Wd. cease to be Emperor of India. Title will be complicated.

Need to make more use of word &amp; idea of Commonwealth vice Doms.

Need to review Comm. relations: modify Statute of Westminster.

E.Sh. Effect of Dom. status on Indians in S. Africa.

P.M. Won’t be affected.

Hopeful mood. But can’t tell what may happen. Congress accept

logic &amp; are becoming more realistic. But Gandhi is

incalculable.

H.M. Sounds almost too good to be true.

Hope Opposn will play on this Bill: Parly. congestn if v. gt.

269

P.M. Have assurance in writing from W.S.C.

H.D. Appreciation for P.M., R.S.C. &amp; A.V.A.

P.M. Credit is Mountbatten’s. He took initiative. Wise now to give

him gt. latitude, so that he can act at once.

Arrangements for announcement in Parliament and broadcast.

Really gives more time for unravelling – once Dom. status

attained more time.

Agreed.

Note. N.B. absent ill from C.M.(47) 51 to C.M.(47) 70 inclusive =

viz. 28.5.47 to 11.8.47. 270
