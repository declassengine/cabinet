C.M. 21(47) 13th February 1947

1. Coal.

P.M. Full situation – statement today and at intervals at request of Opposition. T.N. Ques. today

New Fuel Cttee. – will ginger up offls. who don’t all realise emergency action reqd.

A.V.A. Cd. theatre matinees be definitely stopped? Otherwise, they will open at 4 p.m. because of cinema competn. and will save no coal at all.

P.M. Current situation reports.

G.A.I. T.U.’s co-operative.

H.D. Now it’s in order re consumption.

P.M. Govt. Dpts. to set good example.

2. Parliament. [Enter F.J.B., J.W., N.B. Wilson

Business for the week. [Exit W.W.

3. Economic Survey.

a) Coal. R.S.C. Add paras. (read draft) to passage on coal.

P.M. What prospects of attaining coal target?

Effect of 5 day week.

P.M. Shd. we go on with publn. despite coal crisis? Perhaps a foreword?

E.Sh. Read a new appreciation.

Might induce them to adopt some device. But full 5 day wk. might give us more coal. Better for clearance and maintenance work at weekends. Nos. on colliery books is greater than those effectively at work. Has

never exceeded 640.000. If we cd. get all those to work full no. of

shifts, it wd. mean much more prodn.

This assumes 10 m. open-cast. We are aiming at 15 m. Depends on

machinery not man-power.

P.M. Ques. is: what can we assume for coal prodn. ?) Effects on prodn. of

what can we assume about electricity?) any short-fall there.

118

E.Sh. Also must have mobility of coal.

P.M. With adequate stocks that wdn’t hurt you so much.

A.B. Coal and electricity are fundamental and come before man power shortage.

Not so serious if you can make electricity. Need therefore to build up more electricity capacity. Focus on that. What consumptn. shd. be prevented in 1947 to enable us to get more electricity. E.Sh. National Coal Board say 200 m. is necessary in ’47. But increased

consumption of electricity means shortfall elsewhere in coal.

There is

A.V.A. R.S.C.’s 180 m. figure will be a shock by ref. to figures in Table B. Will mean no hope of retrieving industrial posn. for some years. Critics are saying now 230 m. tons is necessary for full restoration.

R.S.C. 200 m = 4 m. tons p. wk. allowg. for 2 wks. holiday.

We are now at 3.6. a deficit already. You can’t make that good.

J.S. Admit set back : sharpen up statements re 2 bottlenecks of men and

consumptn. restn.

H.D. No more wishful thinking. We’ve made a mess of things. Now must

R.S.C. But still falsifies assumptions re industrial prodn. in ’47. put stocks first and get them right. 15 m. tons I wd. say.

P.M. Must say here what changes you must make because of being unable to

overtake effects of coal crisis.

A.B. Must throw up shortages of fuel.

That obviously affects prodn. both for home and export.

E.E.B. a) Para. 85. Diff. to give lower target for ’47 than ’46.

200 put as lowest target : and didn’t say we cd. get it.

Para. 119. also.

By all means sharpen up passages re means of getting there.

b) This crisis. i) Lost some coal prodn. ii) But have some wh. hasn’t bn. used. Also mood of country improved. May be that ii) will go some way to cancel out i).

P.M. Still come back to ques. : what can we achieve? [Exit AG., C.E., G.T., in coal – is 200 m. realistic figure.

Will be pressed for more f. Labour. Does E.Sh. agree?

E.Sh. Minimum of 700.000 effectively employed. You cd. then get 200 m. tons.

119

P.M. Does 200 m. allow for real stocking p’mme? Can’t risk 4 wks stock.

J.W. Revise also para. 97. We shall get less coal now than when this was

written.

R.S.C. Stocking up will come fr. reduced consumptn. not increased prodn.

This target must be reduced.

P.M. Doesn’t this mean coal rationing?

H.D. War time scheme was v. complicated. Must do something more rough and ready to force down domestic use of coal, gas and electricity. R.S.C. will consider a better plan for industry.

P.M. “Effective ships” via “campaign”. Para. 92.

“As fuel essential to econ. recovery Govt. intend to take drastic steps to reduce domestic consumption”. Agreed.

And include oil conversion here.

R.S.C. Steel. Point is : this is ’47 : 6 wks gone already. We can’t get the figure given for steel.

J.S. Revise, esp. figures in light of Feb. crisis.

E.E.B. Write export down fr. 50 to 40. Write up adverse balance. Wd. be

consistent to write down steel figure. But must have a coal target.

Aim at 200 m. but write in modificns. in respect of liberal allowance for stocking.

N.B. a) Oil – conversion. If industry knew this was long term, they wd. take risk and step up their capacity (6 firms).

b) F. labour. We shd. be able to do more. 56.000 G. p.o.w. in France working in coal w’out prev. experience.

c) If effective force is 640. not 690 – can’t we bring it out : effect on miners wd. be v. great.

A.V.A. Criticism will be for not attackg. problem as we shd. to secure recovery 200 m. target will be thought inadequate as a target because fear of under-emplt. throughout. Set target at what you need : then ask everyone to go for it.

This paper : wrong psychol. approach.

R.S.C. Psychol. wrong to set a target which is unattainable.

Argued out in war : realistic v. carrot. Much more likely to get a realistic one.

A.V.A. All I had in mind was 210. And ask for a 6% increase of effort.

120

E.B. Our war figures for men was 720.000. But nos. of skilled never reached required figure. P.M. Then concentrate on increasg. man power.

G.A.I. People now want to help Govt. Now’s the time for an appeal.

E.B. For influence abroad, we must

E.Sh. By more effective organn. you shd. be able to get more men at the face.

After ques. : admitted tht. increase in labour force wd. increase prodn.

recapture the Dunkirk spirit. And not

argue so much. And don’t keep on saying we can’t. Improvise – allow

the ingenuity of our people to have free play : and stop controlling it all

from London.

b) Electrical Generating Plant

P.L. Formula: Present rate gives only 196 : won’t do : shan’t be satisfied until we get 230 : that wd. not be realistic in near future : propose therefore 200 for ’47.

Agreed : use some such formula for coal.

.

A.B. Why export this if it’s bottleneck at home?

J.W. 3 year production cycle. Valuable to f. policy. f. trade : and much

benefit comes back here in raw materials (eg oil and copper).

P.M. Let J.W. give me a review of prodn. p’mmes.

review of prodn. p’mmes by M/Supply.

Oil conversion (again).

R.S.C. Most valuable long term export.

J.W. Worth reviewing the p’mme.

R.S.C. Was a planned p’mme. Fixed by Heavy Electrical Plant Cttee.

E.B. Can’t hastily break these contracts.

[Re-enter A.G., C.E., G.T.

Consider also wthr. you cd. get some smaller stations into operation quickly.

H.W. Service Dpts. have a no. of mobile plants.

Agreed : enquiry into all mobile plants available : by M/Supply.

J.W. Tankage is 1st call on sheet steel. 121

E.B. Cd. we have report on what cd. be done in a small way – eg. the x/ stations wh. have bn. shut in this crisis : cdn’t they be converted

while they are out. We now have 1.8 m. out of work.

P.M. {Para. 96 : via “campaign” indicate precise and definite action to

{M/Supply to make a report on x/.

N.B. Cd. paras. 82 – onwds. be strengthened similarly. Agreed

{be taken.

.

J.W. Water power. “Mechanical aids” : needed because Hydro. El. 9 mos

behind.

H.D. Have you asked for dollars? Willing to authorise it for machinery.

H.W. No. Excavators fr. U.S. problem : procurement. Now have placed order

for 40 : and altered procurement methods, wh. shd. get us some 2nd

hand machines.

Never has bn. a dollar diffy.

A. Mention Scotl. Hydro. Electric.

This goes for open-cast also, if p’mme settled. Want a long term p’mme.

E.E.B. Put it back in para. 95.

P.M. Target for mining labour shd. be 730.000. Agreed.

P.M. Wages Policy. Para. 27. Revised para. agreed with M/Labour.

G.A.I. Support re-draft. Refce. in present draft suggests we have a wages policy under consn. and we haven’t.

A.B. Shdn’t we say more – viz increased earnings shd. be by methods linking it with increased prodn. State that as a general principle.

Agreed. E.E.B. Any more drafting amendments – by this evening.

N.B. Strengthen what is said about old fear of unemplt.?

P.M. Leave it as now.

G.A.I. Women to come back to industry. Add : where and when will be announced by M/L. locally. Agreed.

N.B. Para. 126. insert “at least”. Agreed.

122

H.D. Para. 128. Don’t like calling this a “target” esp. when distribution has so much. Wd. prefer “probable” or “expected”.

P.M. “Econ. Survey for 1947” as title : Agreed. P.M. Delete : “long term” in this para.

Pamphlet : Battle of Production by C.O.I. Is this a good time for it?

E.E.B. Wholly retrospective.

Issue simple pamphlet – 10 days later.

E.B. Can I be brought in on Press conference ques.

E.Sh. Attraction into under-manned indies. Shd. be short term too.

G.A.I. Can’t be. For its mainly condns. and they can’t be much improved short term.

A.B. Wages policy again.

[Exit A.V.A.

P.M. Publicity F.Wms.

R.S.C. to handle only ques. for Ministerial decns.

P.M. Then don’t publish this one.

P.M. Foreword by P.M?

Draft read.

E.Sh. Object to reference to fuel crisis.

P.M. First ques. shd. there be a Foreword at all.

A.B. Yes : but more controversial in tone. We must fight back. Can’t take full responsibility for this situation. Five main reasons : a) coal. We didn’t assume responsibility until 1/1. b) electricity. c) textiles. d) development areas. e) steel. All black industries because of policy followed in previous years. This is a Party Govt : we must behave as tho’ it is. Appeal to workers, not employers.

General agreement (shd. be a Foreword.

(it shd. be polemical. P.M. This will be pubsd. on morrow of a fuel crisis. Must say we have bn.

running on a narrow margin : this fuel crisis has shown it.

E.Sh. But any oblique reference to this crisis as a warning to us brings this

crisis right to forefront. But it’s not this wh. has produced the genl.

economic situation and the W. Paper and that conceptn. will be given.

123

P.M. Promised long before this crisis. But can’t fail to mention this crisis.

E.B. Get a fighting spirit going.

[Exit 4 invitees.

4. Paper for “Action”.

R.S.C. As in memo.

P.M. But this was banned.

R.S.C. Then keep the ban on.

P.M. Don’t allow a man to found a claim to paper allocn. on publn. wh. was banned.

H.O. and J. to find means.
