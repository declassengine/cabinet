C.M. 17(47) 6th February 1947

1. Death of Miss Wilkinson.

P.M. Asked Cabinet to stand for a moment.

Tributes in H/C today.

2. Parliament.

Business for next week.

E.B. May have to debate on Palestine.

A.G. Don’t want to commit myself in H/C. today.

[Exit R.J. Taylor.

[Enter Barnes Wilmot and G.T.

3. Coal Situation.

E.Sh. Expld. posn. due to weather.

C.E.B. statement tht. 80% cut in electricity wd. be needed in Ldn.

Asked if R.N. cd. convoy ships out of Tyne. But during day 20 left : today hear another 34 have left. Due to arrive in Ldn. tomorrow. Also got 9 train loads fr. S. Wales. But only 4.000 t. Last wk. Ldn. power Stns. used 128.000 t. unprecedented consumptn

[Enter J.W.

Woodhead Tunnel (Pennines) blocked. Cleared last night by Polish troops.

W.O. have now instructed Commands to help in clearing obstns. Yorks. 50% absenteeism due to failure to hack pits.

Ships sailing north : many (9) unable to enter Blyth : others “missing”.

Some improvement in Regions. Scotland : no trouble. Midlands : 9 pits closed. Lancs : fair (but produce only 20% of Lancs. requirements). Open-cast completely suspended : stocks on ground can’t be moved.

Drastic proposals –

a) Export for bunkers shd. be diverted to internal use. Condns. (includg. compensn. and energy powers) are being worked out, failing voluntary agreement.

b) Power stations. Have refused C.E.B. request for 80% cut.

By closing some, we might concentrate load on some of large stations.

Stocks : last Friday over 1 wk. at each station.

Can we cut load selectively – maintaing. most essential services. May be unnecessary to put this cut in – load not heavy on Sat. Sun.

But want plan ready for immed. introdn.

100

Also divertg. coal fr. Warwick etc., to Ldn. Have 7.000 t. in already. Tho’ even fr. there traffic isn’t easy.

Done all I can to get all into Ldn. we can.

Decision now needed on and, if posn. worsens, wthr. we shd. introduce plan for cutting electricity.

Have sought informn. to see how many firms have closed :-

Wk ending 1/2. N.W. 111 firms 1 or more days.

Midl. 26 “ “ 80% return. 30 or 40

Elsewhere v. little.

Total no. of firms 45.000.

G.A.I. Our estimate = 30.000 to 31/1 suffered some unemplt.

R.S.C. Posn. worsened since 31/1.

P.M. Continue to put facts to public.

A.B. Bunkers. Being considered by Dpts. Can’t take decn. now.

Rlway sitn. is being exaggerated.

Shipping : 30 ships away y’day : 24 more today : will cause bunching in south unloading. Action necessary to ensure quick turn round.

30 going up to Tyne : 5 arrived : 3 off Seaham (fog).

Deep sea tonnage will be ready to fill gap due to bunching – if coal can come to ports.

S.W. ports : 20.000 t. 24.000. 22.000 t. moved Mon-Wed. Better than Press statement suggested. Also special trains – 14-16 a day.

Brimsdown Supply pt. for Ldn. power statns. No break down of rail transport.

Staffs have done well – both in shipping and rail.

Shdn’t give public the impn. of a bk. down.

Brimsdown : 29/1. 35 m. 83 cleared

30/1. 89 m. 38 “

31/1. 109 m. 114 “

1/2. 154 m. 91 “

3/2. 194 m. 208 “

4/2. 186 m. 118 “

5/2. 238 m. 105 “

Nos. of wagons : coal lifted, in transit and delivered. No serious drop in tonnage handled.

Collieries blocked because of transport block = only 10.

H.D. This story shd. be part of the publicity. Agreed. Give rlways a good mark.

R.S.C. Factories. Figures as given by E.Sh. – before impact of this weather. They will also suffer fr. diversion to power stations. More short-time must be expected. Virtually no stocks. Few factories this week are

101

getting 50% of allocn. – will run short-time next week. Living hand to mouth.

J.W. Endorsed R.S.C. No up-to-date figures.

Can’t achieve 50% delivery now.

Minimum below wh. firm can’t open. 2 or 3 stopping for that, when enough coal between them to let 1 or 2 work.

Better abandon egalitarian plan and give to priority firms enough to enable them to work.

R.S.C. No time for a scientific plan. What about component in Gp. 2 essential to produce in Gp. 1

A.B. Thought plan wd. do this – at Regional level.

R.S.C. Yes : as rgds. allocn. of pool (reserve) – doesn’t apply to general cut.

E.Sh. Must improvise – switching etc. Can’t have a rigid plan.

Have always said some indies. shd. be cut : no new factory shd. start.

Still believe this : eg. trouble in Lancs.

H.D. May be important, tho’ new.

R.S.C. In fact, new firms aren’t now getting allocns. save in development areas.

Shortfall = 200.000 t. p. wk. Falling wholly on industry’s need of 800.000 t.

Reserve pool = 100.000 t.

E.Sh. Stocks = 7 m. Some firms have 3-4 wks. stock.

E.B. Do you cut on that?

E.Sh. Yes by nil allocations.

R.S.C. And the stocks have gone.

J.W. Midlands : 50% to all has exhausted the pool.

R.S.C. If so, remedy is to increase Midland pool.

E.Sh. May Depts. look at the plan for industry again.

H.D. Need is for more flexibility in Regions. Let Offl. Cttee reconsider plan and authorise Regions accordingly.

R.S.C. How long is industry to take all the shortfall? Domestic consumer gets about 700.000 t. p. wk.

E.Sh. Trouble is dom. consumptn. of electricity.

102

R.S.C. Stick to solid fuel. Why shd. domestic have no cut on solid coal?

E.Sh. Was wise to decide not to cut Ldn. households.

P.M. This is not the moment anyway.

R.S.C. Remember we shall be far below export target.

H.D. Can cut domestic in warmer weather.

P.M. Drastic review of luxury lighting and heating in warmer weather.

E.Sh. We have stopped display lighting and cut street lighting by 50%.

Agreed : plan shd. be made for rest of the year.

A.B. Economy campaign fr. April.

A. For present, avoid scare notices as y’day from M/F and P.

Make factual statement in Parlt. to correct misrepn. of hostile Press.

For present, avoid addl. burden on householder. El. cuts at most inconvenient hours.

Need for sense of proportion.

E.Sh. Said all was well during the war. Trying to put facts on that.

A. Support for E.B. plan for improvisation.

Can’t do all this by rigid plan.

P.M. Much Press comment is political.

A.B. Don’t think it has much effect on opinion, esp. outside Ldn. Can’t run 2 opposite campaigns at once. Say reason for shortage is consumptn. Stocks requd. if economy next winter is to avoid trouble.

Use of radio in publicity. Not using it. Too “liberal” in our approach.

E.B. a) Issue word of thanks to rlways and shipping – from P.M. Agreed.

Statement from No. 10.

b) Summer-time : double : single : shd. be restored.

Helps to increase production (overtime), as well as saving some fuel

consumptn.

Cttee to consider : for one year double summer. Anyway don’t go back to God’s time next winter.

T.W. Econ. agric. arguments against. If proved it’s a coal saver, I will meet farmers and do my best.

103

G.T. Short term. Plead again for 3 basic bldg. indies. bricks, glass, glazed pipes.

Must be some priority to ensure tht. economic units (eg Ldn. Brick Co) be kept going.

H.D. That was and is agreed.

P.M. Can Ldn. Power Stations be kept in this weekend.

E.Sh. Yes : if the ships arrive from Tyne. Even if they don’t can manage till Monday.

P.M. Unloading?

E.Sh. I will attend to that.

Scheme, if needed, will be difft. fr. that in memo. Working on it today.

It is a technical matter.

R.S.C. Must give notice of any selective cuts.

E.Sh. Will report to P.M. at once if posn. can’t be held.

Mil. assistance if needed? Agreed.
