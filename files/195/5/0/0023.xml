C.M. 23(47) 18th February 1947

1. India: Constitutional Position.

P.M. W. came over – plan for a date March – wanted it announced, brief. at

once, but in any event if M. League declined to come in. Accompanied

by phased w’drawal plan. But his emphasis was on date.

Also new plan : Govrs. as in Doms – w’drawal of Services and troops.

New telegram from Wylie (today) – more realistic than Jenkins and

Burrows.

P.L. His point : give leaders a chance before Press get it.

R.S.C. They will get it as soon as leaders have it.

Burrows – depends how it was put to him.

We must recognise tht. if we act we do so v. latest advice of Viceroy.

I &amp; B Cttee met y’day : predom. view – go fwd. That is strong view of

Viceroy elect. Mentioned name. Wd. be fatal to wobble.

H.D. Wd. M. be prepd. for us to say he wd. only accept on those terms.

P.M. Unfair to him. But will be said he is going to transfer power.

A. Serious misgivings re form of statement – part in view of latest advice

from India : reactions of Smuts.

Therefore suggest new formula.

P.M. But we cover main point in para. 10. You merely say M. must do in 2

years what we have h’to failed to do. Your formula implies tht. if he

fails we continue to rule.

We discussed. Pointed out diffies. of w’drawal opn. Revised scheme – appd. by Cabinet.

Also new Viceroy – to be announced at same time. He insists we shd. go out on basis of w’drawal by fixed date.

W. now says no date. Diff. a/c of views of Govrs. and C. in. C.

Statement of date in confidence to Govt.

P.M. Read W’s latest telegram. Also mentioned Smut’s view.

A. No reply yet from other Doms.

R.S.C. Tho’ told statement was to be made there.

P.M. Diff. to appreciate situatn. in India. Tired – &amp; apt to be jittery.

Jenkins typical Punjab view : carry on B. rule.

Urgency : because need to reply to Congress demand tht. M. League w’draw fr. Govt.

Para. 7. contemplates possibility tht. in June ’48 no authy. will have emerged to wh. we can transfer power. Don’t want that suggestn. made.

130

A. You won’t be able to hand over to disorder : you’ll have to go on.

P.M. What will you do then? You mean to remain.

Para. 10.

A. Why not put the date in para. 10?

P.M. Makes no odds.

Add “to responsible Indian hands” after transfer of power and omit “in

India” in para. 7.

A.V.A. Relied on Cab. telegram of 6th June. [Agree.

Cdn’t however w’stand Viceroy’s arguments re run down of Services :

need for a date.

No other course we can follow.

Can’t do it until just before statement is made.

A.V.A. Will cause dissension in India.

P.M. We can

A. Wd. accept June ’48 vice 2 years in my formula.

P.M. We say : doesn’t look promising for a central Govt. we give you a time limit : and if then there were no central Govt. we shd. hand over to other Govts. etc.

Mere drafting.

R.S.C. Add “in accordance with the plan of the Cabinet Mission” in para. 7. after “approved by all Parties in India”.

Sorry we had to depart from it : viz., retain our responsibility until Indians ready to take over.

But this is a historical decision.

But someone shd. study effects of para. 10. other than to a central Govt – includg. internatl reactions, our policy etc.

H.D. Said N. and J. shd. be told in advance. Cd. we not tell W. to do so now.

P.M. Then it will be out before H/C. statement.

Shd. we urge them to form coalition Govts in all Provinces, as suggd. by W?

R.S.C. Cd. be added to para. 9.

P.M. Wylie’s telegram. Let it be done after.

R.S.C. Add – both in the Provinces and at the centre.

[Agreed : no change.

p’pone. But then we must decide about M. League havg.

Interim Govt.

131

J. Sending out a new Viceroy – good man. Wd. have hoped no decision

until he had reported. Gather he won’t go on that basis. But that would

have been a good excuse for delaying a decision.

Agreed : proceed. See Opposition.

P.M. Can’t deal with hypothetical ques.

P.L. Run on passages from India. Shdn’t we do somethg. re shipping.

P.M. No : damp it down. Discourage a “sauve qui pent” move.

A.V.A. Wylie’s telegram : next 3 months.

P.L. Take some time to lay on shipping.

b) Tell Ent. Assocn. to give advice if asked to leave : &amp; stop

people going out

P.L. Burrows’ questions.

R.S.C. Lay off this until M. can report.

P.L. a) Quietly make more ships available over next 2 months. .

A lead under b) but not a jittery lead.

P.L. May I now tell Joyce?

[Enter Service Ministers

J.B.H.

Not b). Can increase shipping under a).

P.M. Yes.

[Exit P.M.

2. Foreign Marriage Act 1892.

N.B. Now agreed with Dpts.

A.G. Bill might be contentious because J’s point – even tho’ said no such people.

A. Start in H/L. Room in March.

A.B. Keep in touch with R.G.

J.B.H. Was intended to cover civilians includg. my chaps. Can this be done within terms of c) in Annexe. Can it be done by O. in. C.

N.B. Not sure. Draftsman can say.

132

J.B.H. Case for covering Control Commn. staff in tht. they are married by Service or C.C. chaplains. There are cases. [Exit P.L.

J. Lex loci Why shd. they not marry under German law.

Approved : clear definn. of H.M. Service in O. in. C.

[Exit Serv. Ministers. J.B.H.

3. Palestine. Let us have Debate first and repns. then let Cab have considered report.

4. Inducements for Coal Miners

E.B. a) Marshall’s view in favour of T. Council. Can’t do it. Have said

“U.N.” via “Assembly” in statement.

b) Immigration. Marshall suggests 3.999 a month : but didn’t press it.

c) U.S. Funds. Marshall took evasive action over that suggn.

A.B. Won’t situation in Pal. be more diff. unless we ease the posn. by allowing more J. immigrn. in interim period. Wd. Arabs really

mind? (!)

E.B. No opinion pronounced on that.

When announced, will write to Sec. Genl. Then up to U.S. to make repns. : let them approach Arabs. eg. Roosevelt’s firm assurance to Ibn Saud.

A.B. Was apparent 18 mos. ago you wdn’t get settlement – esp. since you gave Arabs a veto. Now 7 more months delay. Many d.p’s want to go to Pal. Won’t hold terrorism or illegal immigration.

P.M. Nor are the immigrants who are going in d.p’s. fr. Europe.

C.J. Various problems re interim period will have to be considered by Cab.

.

P.M. Shd. be considered by Fuel Cttee.

Many implications.

R.S.C. Official working party to consider first.

E.Sh. No. a) Delusion tht. increased rations will get men into mines or make existing miners work harder.

b) Wd. have to go to T.U.C. Don’t want to.

133

c) Miners haven’t asked for increased wages. We shdn’t offer a rise.

P.M. This memo. goes wider than coal mines. Must come w’in Econ. Survey review.

E.Sh. Am submittg. memo. on main issues. This will emerge.

P.M. I will consider how this can best be considered.

E.B. Plea for fats for outside workers, if there is anything going.

P.M. Not a matter for off-hand decision.

5. Princess Elizabeth.

P.M. S. Africa giving her diamonds. But Parlt. nor Govt. have ever given a present.

A.B. Don’t create a precedent.

Agreed : no gift : H/C. resoln. : only telegram.
