1. Cyrenaica.

goes out. View of E.B. in agreement with Ministers concerned.

2. Indonesia.

P.M. Statement of long-term policy undesirable before 4 Power Commn

Cabinet agreed.

P.M. Telegrams (e.g. 473) unsatisf. Are we holding candle to devil.

McN. Posn unsatisf. Suggested to E.B. we ask U.S. to make joint approach

promised.

opportunity.

J.S. War of re-conquest wd. delay our food supplies for even 10 yrs.

involve our buying otherwise than v. Dutch indebtedness.

on behalf of Chinese merchants.

J.S. But if the trade were legitimised, this wdn’t be so.

P.M. to submit Cab. views to E.B. &amp; suggest he sees Dutch

to Dutch.

This will be another Palestine unless they scale down troops as

P.M. We held the fort for them: shall be discredited if they thus misuse

Re-conquest idea is quite unrealistic – imperialism out of date.

H.D. Non-dollar supplies. Strongest pressure shd. be used.

C.J. Let alone political repercussions in Malaya &amp; elsewhere.

McN. But equally we can’t approve Indonesian economic policy – which wd.

Blockage v. B. flag: mainly however for black market in Singapore

Ambass.

3. Coal Imports.

Para. 9. Cost v. high &amp; quality poor. Might try a cargo: but N.C.B.

Any purchases shd. be made thro’ N.C.B., not by private firms

E.Sh. Becoming matter mainly of f. policy. French condns are for F.O.

Also allocation is uncertain.

don’t want it.

e.g. Duncan.

Over 4 m. tons last week in a normal 5 day week – deep &amp; open cast.

Have asked (thro’ Press) for another ¼ m. 259

Absenteeism down to 8% - lowest since 1938.

If this effort can be sustained, might not require imports.

McN. Can’t predict attitude of U.S. or French on E.C.O. Want authy for our

repves to w’draw request if feelings run too high.

Doubt if we cd. agree Fr. proposals re Saar before E.C.O. mtg. this month.

E.Sh. Such an agreement might have pol. consequences in Ruhr wh. wd.

lose as much prodn there.

McN. x/ If U.S. availability doesn’t reach 3.4: &amp; we find ourselves against both U.S. &amp; Fr. Minister shd. have discretion to w’draw.

R.S.C. Don’t w’draw too easily. Any coal wd. be worth having.

H.M. Yes: get it if we possibly can.

General agreement: don’t buy this costly U.S. coal.

Agree N.C.B. shd. have import monopoly in this diff. time: but don’t

assume they always should. Needs more thought.

H.D. In normal times we shd. export. abroad.

cf. bricks. True they can import cheaper, but must see that when

4. Palestine: Financial Situation.

R.S.C. Hope N.C.B. will, nonetheless, contact those who say they can buy

E.Sh. Final para. of my memo.

G.T. While coal rationed &amp; prices fixed, important to work thro’ N.C.B.

here it counts as part of ration. Watch that.

Agreed: as at x/ above.

[Exit G. Strauss.

C.J. a) Cost will fall on Arabs &amp; Jews alike, tho’ Jews alone are to

blame – for maintenance of Cyprus camps.

c) Sequestration of J. funds. Want to warn Cab. that I shall be

b) M’while H. Commr. suggests special tax to compensate Shell

of one company. Might have a general fund for all damage

H. Commr. has now put fwd. another plan: voluntary

Willing to have that explored. If, however, compulsion

needed still think scope of fund shd. be wider.

bringing this up later.

H.D. Financial position of Palestine is not so desperate.

They can increase taxation - &amp; they should.

Shell: were they not insured? If not, why not? Examine that before

In 1946/47 small surplus expected. Balance in hand of £3 v. Budget

extraordinary expenditure.

Will ask Cab. to reject any proposals for more from Exchequer.

any taxpayer forks out. They shd. not be put in a preferential position as cpd. with other cos. or taxpayers.

A.B. No special J. tax (Goebells).

on this ques.

[Exit E.Sh. &amp; H. McN.

H.M. Many points of detail on which L.P. Cttee will have to pronounce –

One point of substance. We (Cabinet) never decided wtr. travelling,

All Cab. need do now is to agree in principle &amp; authorise early

A.B. Approval of my draft reply will suffice: covers any safeguards or

Formula doesn’t commit us always to pay both subsistence &amp; loss of remunerative time. There may be some cases where

it is right to pay both.
