C.M. 94(47). 11th December, 1947.

1. Local Authorities: Voting by Co-operative Society Members.

A.B. As in memo.

M/H. shd. say in debate tht. co-op. members must be careful &amp; fair.

J. V. dang. principle. One share in a co. disqualifies e.g. a Judge.

Inadequacy of power of dispensation.

Repns from Co-ops. P.M. shd. not receive a deputn at this time

because wd. tie our hands in dealing with any amendment.

Must make it clear, if we act, tht. we aren’t weakening law on

preventn of corruption.

Propose to accept arranged amendment.

H.M. L.P. Cttee considered: disposed to think it right: but may cause a row

on basis we are favouring co-op. friends. Small traders etc., may

say we are discriminatg. in favour of our pol. supporters.

But risk is ideological – not corrupt favouritism to Co-op.

contracts but unreflectg. enthusiasm.

if he doesn’t disclose.

A.B. Co-op. members wd. also be requd to disclose interest.

J. Further diffy: discriminatg. betwn. Co-ops &amp; ordinary companies.

G.A.I. Put it on basis of practical diffy: so many l.a.’s with v. large no. of

Co-op. members.

A.V.A. No special favour to individual member of Co-op. in Co-op. getting

contract.

No objn to private contractors on a Council opposing direct labour

activities of Council.

P.M. That isn’t the same point.

C.E. Justifn = impract. of carrying on. e.g. Scunthorpe, where all members

but 4 were Co-op. members &amp; they had to deal with planning

issue affectg. Co-op. premises.

P.M. Can you give parallel concession to share holders in C.O.S.?

A.V.A. Diff: because membership of limited liability co. is limited.

P.M. Doesn’t alter fact that when they are members they have an interest.

G.T. Can’t we give it all round to people whose interest is not more than

£200 – in whatever kind of company – on declaration of

interest. [Exit C.E.

386

R.S.C. Wdn’t matter if he had only one vote.

P.M. If you want to get this through, you must give concession to private

cos. equally with Co-ops.

A.B. Important ques. are: no concealed interest: interest not substantl

propn of capital.

R.S.C. Less than £200 or 100th part of capital of co. whichever is less?

P.M. Principle to be: shareholders in cos. to be in same posn as Co-op.

members.

Agreed. [Exit A.B.

2. Parliament.

Business for next week.

3. Parliament: Members’ Pensions Fund.

Fact is few members have bn. eligible. But duty of House is to look

H.M. Sel. Cttee recommd improvemts. &amp; reduced disregards. Also redn in

contns £12 to 9.

Labour members favoured m’taining contns &amp; raising benefits

still higher.

after its own.

Don’t think we’ll get it higher than £15 vice £12. Must leave to

free Vote.

Actuary’s view = benefits recommended warrant contn of £21.

Have arranged with R.S.C. to present W. Paper giving Actuary’s view.

Suggest Fin. Secy. shd. open &amp; give facts. C.E., in replying, can still

leave it to House: amendg. motions shd. be put by private

Members: but C.E.’s bias shd. be in favour of raising it.

T.W. Supported this view.

Don’t run ahead of capacity of fund – or willingness of Members to

contribute. Be guided by experience.

4. Scotland: Devolution.

A.W. All in memo.

H.M. We have considered. A.W. has bn. reasonable. Scots. mayn’t like

e.g. Second Rdg. not on floor: but if they don’t like it, won’t

happen.

387

H.H.M. has, however, minuted me about Econ. Conference. Shdn’t be announced until after debate on Wales, or wd. provoke a demand for such a Welsh Conference.

Believe myself Scotland is diff. from Wales. Welsh Conference was

chaired by an official – no suitable Minister.

P.M. No difference on economic side in Sc. Law.

R.S.C. But S. of S. &amp; Dpts. &amp; various existg. bodies. Argument for bringing

those together. Agree there will be a demand from Wales.

W.W. Raised at Welsh Parly. Party last night: they are on war path.

A.W. Wales has an econ. Con. now which Scotland hasn’t.

And my case for it is co-ordination fr. Dpl. angle.

Pressure of opinion in Scotland. Wise to meet it. My plan will

satisfy reasonable opinion.

E.B. What about Home Rule for England. I’m serious about this.

shd. not

P.M. Trouble from Wales.

H.W. We are happy – after discn with Sc. officials.

A. Dpts. shd. be more reasonable about Sc. claims – e.g. transport, civil

aviatn.

Welcome A.W.’s plan – for frame of mind.

E.B. Suppose Transport conceded Scotland’s claim &amp; then was pressed to

to same for Wales, where transport is not an entity. He was

right to keep this out of Bill. Sensible adminn organisation be subordinated to political feelings.

G.A.I. How will this fit in with G.B. Dpts? Split Estimates?

W.W. Para. 1(2). Cd. you then reduce 2 days in House to 1?

N.B. Also composition.

A.W. Certainly not.

A.W. No: for 2 days in Grand Cttee = 1 day on floor.

R.S.C. Para. 1(3). Wd. like to consider t. of r.

P.M. Para. 1(4). Will it be debated in Grand Cttee or on floor?

A.W. Financial statement. I’m not v. keen on this, but wd. like Ty. to

consider.

388

R.S.C. Diff. to get it accurate.

Memo. approved.

Welsh Debate.

H.M. H.H.M. cd. take this if he were here. [Exit W.W.

A.W. Wd. rather say can’t do it pro tem. on man-power grounds.

H.M. In answer to P.M., no extra time on floor.

A.W. They wd. do it on Grand Cttee.

P.M. Scott. T.U.C. ?

A.W. They are on many of the constituent bodies, &amp; wd. come in thus.

P.M. Shd. be direct repn of 2 sides of industry?

A.W. Not on this. Will watch and see this point is met.

These people aren’t officials, tho’ holding jobs.

H.M. Better to have such responsible people. [Exit N.B.

E.B. Play it soft as a consultative body.

A.W. Don’t want to make too much of this.

Enter J.S.

5. Food Prices.

R.S.C. As in memo.

T.W. Vice shill eggs &amp; bacon: raise eggs by 1/= and bacon by a

correspondingly less sum. Raise egg prices in spring when

in accord with meat prices.

R.S.C. I have no objn.

J.S. Nor I. Ty. wanted bacon, to get somethg. totally de-subsidised.

E.B. Make it 3d an egg w’out seasonal change. And raise tea by 4d

supplies become free-er. Bacon by 6d (vice 1/=) wd. be more

A. Agree. People willing to pay more for eggs.

vice 10d.

H.W. A 3d egg wd. obviate 50% of the rise in tea prices.

389

J.S. But let us associate price increases with supply increases.

Sugar.

R.S.C. Don’t raise that again. Look at prospects in Canada &amp; Argentine.

Agreed {subject to adjustment with tea, bacon and eggs. {least possible publicity.
