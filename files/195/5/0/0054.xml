C.M. 74 (47) 25th August, 1947 1.

Balance of Payments: Planning Board.

H.M. Planning Bd. getting restive because not consulted on short-term measure.

Can I have discretion to keep them informed currently – to keep them

sweet.

Agreed: subject to care over ration cuts etc.

Miners Hours. Told now, privately, tht. Govt. shd. write &amp; ask for extra 1/2 hour.

Ques: some pits can’t work the 1/2 hr. shd. these work Sats? Prs.

better not to confuse it. Recommend we reject their Sat. proposal

and ask them to consider again the 1/2 hr.

H.M. Mtg. with N.U.M. Thursday.

N.U.M. rejected extra 1/2 hrs. Willing tht. every miner shd. work Sats. so as to enable each pit to work Sats.; but rejected the 71/2 for 6 payment condition. Offered, as alternative, discretion to managers to refuse to admit to Sat. work men who had bn. absent earlier in week for no good cause. We rejected that.

E.Sh. My informn: more substantial opposn in coal-fields than in N.U.M. to the extra 1/2 hr.

Believe N.U.M. will continue to resist the 1/2 hr. &amp; to insist on their condns for Sat. working. Stints: strike at Grimethorpe, Yorks. shows how much N.U.M. likely

to get there. But if N.U.M. succeed with stints, restns &amp;

absenteeism no need for extra hours. Redn in absenteeism from

10% to 6% wd. secure our target.

E.B. Mustn’t yield on Sat. proposal. Wd. be weakness. Their price for

selling back the Saty was too high.

But facts shd. be known now, as Horner is makg. publicity.

A.B. No concession.

I wd. press the 1/2 hr.

A.V.A. What happened at Delegate Conference?

H.M. Don’t know. I left.

T.W. Extra 1/2 hr. useless in many pits w’out extension of Stints.

Many pits where no restn of stint = then workg. time wd. give dividend.

Write lr. re honouring 5 day-week agreement.

Pursue separately idea of ballot on 1/2 hr. Put a time-limit = no more than 12 months &amp; leave it to them to vote it off then. Go to miners direct; tho’ N.U.M. wd. have to hold ballot. 284

E.B. Put that orally, not in a letter.

E.Sh. Dangerous. Adverse vote wd. be fatal.

I advise leaving it for a day or so. No letter.

E.B. Convey it to N.U.M. that Cab. endorse what was said by Ministers on Thursday re rejection of their Sat. working proposal. 1.

A.B. And add that we press for the 1/2 hr.

Agreed.

(Contd) Balance of Payments. No country has yet adopted intransigent attitude re supplies.

Credit to W.E. &amp; Mission for success achieved – incldg. getting the

lost $150 millions in.

R.S.C. New export p’mme in 10 days.

Our announcement hasn’t caused expected shock to world trade.

Clear now tht. drain was due to certain countries hastening to cash in on dollars.

Tory Press. No evce tht. U.S. has put their pressure

…………… out of room 20 minutes …………

E.Sh. Supporting comments by P.M., A.B. &amp; others. Idle to suppose we can cut ourselves off sharply from dollar sources. Must continue trade with U.S.

“Exports of 140% or 160% over pre-war can be achieved only by cuts on our capital expenditure”.

R.S.C. I want more informn on this. To get more exports, we need more power – to get that capital investment is requd. Mustn’t cut capital expenditure for sake of exports, w’out more informatn &amp; care.

P.M. 3 methods: increase exports = increase home prodn.

Must come to decisions fairly soon.

A.B. These pp. assume tht. resources sacrificed by Govt. p’mme will be more prudently employed by private sector.

P.M. No: we must be sure tht. proper use is made of resources freed.

P.M. Want them quickly. For bad to announce negative w’out positive measures.

285

A.B. Re-deployment not cuts: &amp; shd. be presented as such.

J.S. Can R.S.C. assure us increased exports won’t go to countries we don’t import from?

R.S.C. Must go mainly on bi-lateral deals. a) Cuts in Food Consumption.

J.S. Private rooms mainly – diff. to police.
