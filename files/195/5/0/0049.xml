G.A.I. to reply. Agreed.

Business for week after Whitsun Recess.

A.B. Radio-Active Substances Bill. Met Cherwell. New Clause for

Advisory Cttee had bn. drafted.

Ready to hold mtg. with both sides in H/Lds. to reach agreement.

[Exit W.W.

2. Antiqui: Compensation to Widow.

P.M. Is there precedent for grant of compensn in Antiqui case?

C.E. Clear tht. he did help to prevent escape.

Won’t be related to pension of policeman’s widow. Annuity

for £100 p.a. + £18 for each child to age 16.

[Enter J. Westwood &amp;

L.S.

3. Bankside Power Station.

H.M. Oil-burning will add substantially to cost. This shd. be disclosed in

debate – shows sincere effort to reduce damage to amenity.

Warning note re extra cost of oil-firing.

Parly. &amp; public opinion is softening. Recommend we stand firm.

Sulphur: more diff. in coal than oil (? reverse order): experts can cope

with it: will add to cost.

Strategic aspects of power stations shd. be considered.

P.M. Have been.

Sound to have at least one oil-firing station on Thames. Cost may vary

with coal/oil cost.

H.D. Coal more likely to rise in price than oil.

J. My statement of facts in H/L. converted many peers who were not

party pris.

Satisfied we should go on with the plan.

A.B. Still against this: but don’t recommend Cab. To resile from yet

another decision. Suppose Fine Arts Commn turn it down? Believe they will.

262

P.M. They will consider qua planning. That is our business not theirs.

arisen. Cost was not a point made by the objectors. Generally,

E.Sh. T. of r. in 1924 and 1933 were clear: relate solely to design, not

siting.

L.S. Their t. of r. do empower them to recommend on siting tho’ not to

Diff. to justify change of decision now because no new fact has

H/C. is behind us.

[Exit L.S.

Enter McN. &amp; J.Wilmot.

4. Level of Industry in Germany.

finishing end. Why not rely on that from outset.

A.V.A. Security policy has bn. settled 3 years since. Was potential. Inspn at

T.W. Sympathy with M/H. Shortage of steel. Absurd to be [Exit E.Sh.

A.B. But U.K. working to 13/15 m. – with populn little more than ½ of G.

McN. Summarised memo.

Have now reviewed, however, decisions of w. party in Berlin. If

11 m. tons accepted, we wd. have to raise levels in certain other

x/ industries. Wd. like authy to proceed with revising these figures

on basis of coming back to Cabinet or O.R.C. if any Dpl. objn.

J.W. Endorsed this.

E.Sh. Effect on Ruhr coal. 2½ - 3 m. tons requirement of coal for steel may

rise to 7 m. tons. May affect French?

McN. Any rise in level of industry will involve more coal. But coal output

will limit pace at which we can raise it.

A.B. Why not accept U.S. figure of 13½ m.?

Security argument is untenable. Shall have to rely on inspection at the

Commercial competition. Can a Socialist Govt. m’tain that this is the

way to m’tain full employment.

finishing end wd. not alone be effective or enforceable.

restricting B. output artificially. Starving world of raw materials

instead of ensuring their right use.

R.S.C. V. academic. No practical chance of G. producing anything like

10/11 m. tone for years to come. Real ques.: what shd. be their

standard in 5/10 years’ time. By then 10/11 m. tons from

Germany wd. be enough to give adequate steel output for Europe.

R.S.C. But in supply countries other than our own.

Agree with U.S. &amp; you will have gt. trouble with Fr. &amp; Russia.

263

A.B. Why be hag-ridden by Fr. &amp; Russia.

A.B. Steel no longer important for war potential – bacteriological warfare.

we shall than know what sort of Germany.

getting. And can be used more quickly here than in Germany.

P.M. They have real cause for suspicion of Germany. Time we showed

some sympathy with our European friends &amp; not always follow

U.S. lead.

Don’t therefore create focus for demagogy in Germany.

H.M. Can review it again when they are nearing the new maximum. And

McN. Object: to ascertain repns deliveries – which we are interested in

H.D. With financial benefit.

Memo. agreed + x/. [Exit J.W.

5. Procedure for Japanese Peace Settlement.

for mtg. in Canberra. N.Z. supported this.

initiate discussions.

at this stage.

Met Dom. H. Commrs. y’day: all Doms. v. much concerned, not to be

elbowed out.

Evatt has suggested tht., if E.B. can’t go to Canberra, cd. I go

Agreed we shd. ask U.S. to mark time - &amp; allow Dom. talk to take

S. Africa now may be willing tht. Smuts shd. go to Canberra.

End/August &amp; first 2 wks Sept. is only possible time. Ready to go

with McN. at that time.

Good reason (Commonwealth) for having a mtg. in Australia.

McN. a) Only for exchange of inter-Commonwealth views.

b) Wd. like to consult E.B. before telegram goes.

H.D. Shd. try to meet Australian views.

L. Hope Govts/India &amp; Burma will be asked to send repves.

P.M. Depends on events.

Agreed: subject to E.B.’s views.

[Exit McN. Enter J.G.

H.D. Man Power.

a) Service Depts. W.O. increases } 58.000 more than pre-war. Admy. &amp; Air Miny. }

Service Dpts.

memo. is like an Opposn speech on the Budget. Why didn’t you

be dispensed with.

H.M. Political dangers of figures in Appendix.

C.E. Am ready to analyse 5% cut. But wdn’t it be better to consider on the

The 5% wd. in practice mean 13% off a limited field in which you

P.M. Why stand in a white sheet because we are practising Socialism.

E.g. socialised industry, bulk purchase, economic controls.

M/Supply employ 42.000, some of whom doing work done pre-war by

This is out of line with strategic realities &amp; also what we can afford.

P.M. We had special Cttee on this - &amp; a Rpt. which took it Dpt. by Dpt. This

bring up your comments in detail on the detailed report. We

considered then many of these details.

H.D. Expressed dissatisfn then. Raising it now because cost is rising.

Asking for decisions on wage claim.

P.M. Willing to have this up again on Cttee report: but not in this general

way.

H.D. Can’t justify more pay unless smaller nos.

P.M. Why? If the claim is just, shd. it not be met whatever the numbers.

A.B. Ty. resistance to applns for more staff for more duties.

P.M. All this was explained in detail in the other paper.

T.W. Can’t accept arbitrary cut of 36.000 w’out knowing what services can

R.S.C. They are known.

facts, which were investigated by my Cttee. Example: Service

Dpts. shift from Service clerks to civilian clerks.

cd. cut.

As in paras. 3-5 of J.A.C.R.’s memo.

Willing to consider with H.D. &amp; submit to Cab. agreed statistical

picture of real drain on productive manpower.

Bound to have more people employed by the State.

H.D. But no waste.

265

T.W. More care needed in considering man-power implications of new

C. Service.

P.M. Have a speech prepared for use in appropriate stage in H/C. This

Agreed: H.D. to discuss with C.E., whose Cttee will

[Exit R.S.C.

P.M. Why didn’t you prove waste to the Cttee.

A.B. Start a counter attack on Unilever etc., who have adminve staffs.

H.M. Don’t get mentality of defending inflated Civil Service.

policies

P.M. Won’t get anywhere with generalised attack.

A.B. Can’t we have investign designed to give us material for defence of

material can be made available to Ministers.

then consider the matter further.

Pay Claims.

H.D. authorised to settle claims a) and b) on basis recommended in

memo.

J.S. On b), this stops at £900. Cdn’t it go to the top.

have an allowance. If pay insufficient, review on its merits.

E.E.B. Higher grades have never worked as little as 38½ hrs. Infra-dig to

Staff Amalgamations of M/N.I. and Assistance Board.

A.G. As in memo. - Agreed.

[Exit J.G.

7. Equal Pay.

A.G. Unanimous agreement not to implement the age-old policy of the

Party – for solid practical reasons.

But can’t repudiate the principle too brusquely.

No announcement before P.M. has bn. able to speak to T.U.C.

Cdn’t readily make statement in H/C. on morning of Recess. Draft

annexed for statement after Recess.

At Margate I would promise early statement.

P.M. The draft would need careful consideration.

Various points with which I cdn’t agree.

A.B. “Two forms of payment.” Absorb one wave before we start another.

266

P.M. Why shdn’t H.D. make the announcement.

H.D. I don’t dissent. Settle after Margate.

G.T. If we re-affirm faith in principle, we shall encourage Burnham Cttee

to consider this afresh. Announcemt. on lines of draft and of

A.B.’s proposal wd. help me. For I cd. then say I wasn’t at

8. Agricultural Losses Due to Floods.

liberty to consider.

H.M. References in draft to “present” implies we will do it later. We shdn’t

imply that.

[Exit J. &amp; A.B.

T.W. Need for P.M. directive for future similar to that for emergency.

P.M. Not wise for Cabinet to give over-riding priorities.
