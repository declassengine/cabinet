C.M. 44(47) 6th May 1947

1. Future Meetings.

P.M. Cabinet : Monday, 11.30 a.m. – provisional.

2. Poland. E.B. Mixed Commn. coming over to settle compensn ques.

Trade Agreement likely to be concluded in 2 wks. or so.

This results from Financial Agreement.

3. Ceylon : Constitutional Development. P.M. That means leaving it to chance wthr. they agree.

C.A.S. Ceylon is important a) as a base, essential to commns. through Indian

Ocean. W’out it neither air nor surface craft cd. cover Indian Ocean.

A.V.A. Also firm arrangements with Australia – B. offr. i/c Naval Board.

We gave long considn. to Soulbury Rpt. I saw everyone there last

May(?) and they were all quite pleased with what we had done and

promised.

C.J. Electn. campaign about to start. S. has rallied moderate Parties and is likely to be returned tho’ opposed by Comm. and Indian Groups. His diffy : being pressed by own supporters on ques. of constitutional advance. Said he cd. have got more if he had pressed us harder. eg Burma, disloyal in war. Situatn. may get out of his control : will be pressed v. hard when Assembly meets – even for immed. decln. of independence. Believes he can hold this posn. if he makes decln. as in memo. Pretty clear we cd. rely on getting satisfy. Treaty assurances. Ceylon fears being drawn into orbit of India and wd. give us what we want.

P.M. In what form? Treaty?

C.J. If decln. made, negotns. cd. start at once. New Govt. in Nov. cd. declare wthr. they favoured such an agreement : then we cd. introduce legn.

Also Doms. have a view on this.

b) as a link, essential for cable wireless and air communications. with Far East. No possibility of reinforcement without it.

P.M. Simonstown arrangement with S. Africa : is a precedent for granting independence while retaining base rights.

Concerned at haste – effect on Parlt., public opinion etc.

243

Thought development to Dom. status was acceptable, as planned.

Weakening of our posn. all over the world. Getting out of hand.

P.M. Large minorities. May appease Ceylonese : but what of row with India

over their minorities.

P.M. But by your decln. you invite them to re-open all these issues.

Announcement shd. I think in view of C.O.S. report, be a decln. of

intentn.

P.M. Burma diff. because no serious minority troubles.

A.G. If nothing is said, bitter controversy will brk. out in Ceylon and

movement for complete independence may grow.

Various minor issues re status cpd. with Doms. Agree we must discuss

with Doms. various grades of independence. Canada has raised this

already : suggesting discussions next year.

P.M. This constitution was put fwd. by Ceylon Ministers.

C.J. Yes, in 1943. But look what’s happened since – I warned you of effect

of Burma developments.

C.J. Constitn. safeguards for minorities will come into opern. tho’ new Govt cd. change them if it acquired independence : but not before a further Act of Parlt. in Westminster.

C.J. Govr. a shrewd pol. observer, thinks a clamour for independence will have more serious routes.

“Independence w’in Commonwealth” – involves special place for some of the developing parts of Comm. S. Rhodesia, as well as Ceylon, are anomalous. S. is not pressing for “Dom. states” because it involves consent of other Doms. and amendment of statute of W’minster.

This phrase was used by P.M. in reln. to India.

This phrase is not new. With satisfy. safeguards. M. defence and f. policy, cd. we not make a forthcoming statement wh. wd. assist S. to hold the position.

P.M. Diff. to judge w’out draft statement.

C.J. My intentn. was a promise of indep. w’in Comm. condl. upon agreements v. defence. Draft statement wd. have to be agreed with C.O.S. and Doms.

A. Doms. are vitally concerned. We told them on 1/5 what was afoot. We must now inform them of views of C.O.S. Don’t like to rush into a statement as early as next week.

We can’t afford to throw Ceylon away.

244

E.B. “Independence” has implicns. for U.N. Don’t use it. Cdn’t deny them

membership of U.N.

Why can’t he take his time, as his own, in Election : and we can talk

business with him when he has won it.

Can’t do this in a hurry.

J. Importance of real

If this is done, how long shall we keep Malaya.

H.M. Is S. any worse off if we delay statement until after Election?

Elements of a deal here, if he will stand to it.

But language is awkward.

E.B. Resolns. in U.N. for w’drawal of f. troops from “independent” territories! consultn. here with Doms.

A.V.A. x/ in para. 4 : we really must define our policy on this issue.

E.B. France has given up none of her overseas Empire. Remember that the “liberal” line didn’t work with Egypt. Don’t want any more failures.

U.S. (Navy, anyway) wdn’t like this.

P.M. Tell M.S. tht. we can’t take precipitative action. Matter wh. affects Doms.

They have earlier assurances. New Constitutn. coming in, wh. they proposed. He shd. stand against his own extremists.

A.V.A. And deny x/. in para.4 : doesn’t represent U.K. policy.

E.B. Quote Simonstown precedent : from War Cab. records. A simultaneous transaction.

L. Consult Indian Govt. – same basis as other Doms.

H.D. Not at this stage.

P.M. No consultn. with Indian Govt.

C.J. Pol. repercussions in Ceylon will be serious.

E.B. Who raised this? Some of our overseas repves. are getting appeasers – care more for interests of people to whom assigned than for B. interests.

Did Govr. start this?

C.J. Ivor Jennings – Chancellor of Ceylon University – probably started it.

P.M. We don’t know views of minorities. We shd. say we can’t tear up the agreement we made after consultg. all interests.

245

C.J. It is view shared by Govr. – his officials.

In reply to E.B. – Ceylon does want to be represented in U.N.

[Enter C.E., J.W. and Barnes

P.M. Willing to consider a draft statement.

E.B. Keeping the door open to constitutional change.

P.M. C.O.S. m’while to work out what agreement for bases we shd. require.

[Exit Service Ministers and C.O.S.

4. Railway Charges and Wages Claims.

B. Gave alternative yields of various rates of increase.

Must bring mounting bill to an end. Hence recommns. in para.15.

Delay beyond 1st July wd. involve increased cost which wd. have to be met by Ty.

These increases wd. cause gt. concern in Parly. Labour Party. Don’t see, however, how we can avoid them. Shd. be made before rlways are nationalised.

H.M. Two points of fact:-

(a) L.P. Cttee decided we shd. not raise fares until after wages claim settled.

(b) Thought M/L. favoured Ct. of Enquiry vice Arbitratn. Tribunal.

H.D. L.P. Cttee view has bn. tht. Ty. shdn’t go on subsidising rlways. We are assistg. natl. industries by cheap money and low compensn. That will be undermined if we go on subsidising rlways. We must so arrange the charge tht. “wretched thing” (viz. a nationalised industry) pays its way.

Even so, however, I accept view tht. we must carry this years cost.

Hope H.M. isn’t opposing para. 15(a). For that wd. mean delay.

I wd. favour 2 bites at this cherry. Get the losses covered quickly.

Then if increased wages follow, we can raise charges again.

H.M. Thought M/L. cd. get wages settlement quickly.

Awkward political move to raise rlway charges. Wd. prefer not to do it twice. Also double disturbance to the public.

Don’t know effect on negotns. of telling them the facts.

246

B. Am against 2 bites. Support H.M. on this. Wd. prefer delay to 1/8 or soon after so as to handle both at once.

c) Delay. Better do this on wage increase, if we have to do it : better

case for us on that basis.

A.V.A. This will mean delaying increases until nearly October. What effect on

Ty?

H.D. More than £20 m. this year, even if raised on 1/7.

Transport is apt. to run in grooves(!)

Tho’ I don’t believe in subsidising over the long run, it may be sense to

pay for a time.

B. Cdn’t accept view tht. this deficiency cd. be absorbed by increased

efficiency.

G.A.I. Negotns. in 3 stages. a) M/T. gives facts to both sides : that accords with our policy. b) Industry must meet, and if they disagree c) we must establish arbitral machinery.

On c) I wd. prefer a Ct. of Enquiry : which cd. go wider than Arbitn. Tribunal eg. in considering relations with wages in other industries and might also take 3 Unions together. Better a full review even at cost of some delay.

E.Sh. a) Implicns. increase in coal prices carrying from 6th to 1/9d. a ton : average i/r.

The £88 m. increase wd. involve a further increase of 4/= a ton in coal.

b) Incidence of increase : shdn’t fall too heavily on workmen’s farms and dormitory towns.

B. Losses in July/Aug. will be less than early in year.

P.M. Bad to go on raising fares?

I. Para. 2 : future deficiency of £24½ m. p.a. – takes no a/c of reduced interest rates.

B. Doesn’t assume natn.

E.B. Object shd. be to reach settlement which will carry for several years.

If so, what economies do we expect from improved organisation etc? Will going to 44 hrs. in fact have consequences indicated in memo? Revised schedules etc.

Wd. regret increase of fares in mid summer. Bad politics. I wd. aim at 1st Oct. on that account.

Let wage increases force increased efficiency – to preserve profits.

Take a long term view : and Ty. cd. stand out of their money for a time.

I agree tht. date be chosen carefully. Hence para.15(a).

247

If principle is accepted.

Agreed: Take this in one bite.

Make it clear to both sides of industry

(jointly) that any change resulting from

wages and hours claim will be in addn. to

these figures.

5. Iron and Steel Nationalisation Bill

Natd. transport system shd. not be subsidised (tho’, like Budgets, we might balance over a term of years.)

Accept these as increases required if we were doing it at once. They may be efficient in light of any increased wages etc.

M/L. and M/T. to settle issue betwn. Ct. of Enquiry : Arbitration Tribunal.

Took note of C.P. 147.

.

P.M. As in brief.

Cash for this project was made in C.P.(46)120.

H.D. Also in speeches in H/C. debates.

A. We must make a case in H/Lds. Wasn’t satisfied tht. a good enough

case can be prepared.

P.M. Will you then study C.P.(46)120 and H/C. Debates.

J.W. Parly. Group have asked me to address them.

Also industry must know effect on current reorganisation scheme.

If we are to look at the “case” better do it now.

Recalled earlier discns. of Cab. and Cab. Cttees. Scheme adopted now follows the line suggested by E.B. at early Cab. Cttee stage.

Baldwins (U’lever) about to register new co. Want authy. to see him and give him some more detail. But he has now regd. his co.

Hope he will go on with the scheme.

The others ….. Arguments that this is a bad time to do it. But the case

for doing it this way (reorganisation) is just enough to warrant our

claiming its international interest. If it is to be done, quicker the better.

E.B. Diffy. of severance is avoided by this scheme.

P.M. Parly. diffy. disclosures?

H.M. Parly. Group cd. be made to wait. A leak isn’t an announcement.

P.M. Minister must give industry (leaders) an outline of the scheme.

248

H.D. He shd. tell them due a/c will be taken of any expenditure incurred m’while.

We must try to carry these men with us.

6. Leakages of Information

J.W. I must tell them which companies are in, and that we will buy 100% of the equities. .

7. Coal : Strike in Durham

C.E. Mtg. of Emergencies Cttee last week. Oral statement only. Over weekend good a/c of discussions and decisions reached.

H.D. Steel leakage : Ministers names.

J.W. Leakage has seriously impaired my bargaining posn. with Federation. .

P.M. Message from Will Lawther regarding his statement to Press.

E.Sh. Small Union, 150 men or so. What they really want is recognition.

Not really a ques. of wages.

N.C.B. have decided they must not give way on this. They are training substitutes. N.U.M. agree with this. We must support it.

E.B. Let N.U.M. fight it.
