1. Parliament.

H.M. Home Secy. to be Deputy Leader of H/C. vice Greenwood. 2. Budget.

H.D. Authy, in principle, to have autumn Budget. To cover increased

Wd. be as short as poss. to save Parly. time.

P.M. Must do this.

A.B. Ty. shdn’t be allowed to put in odds &amp; ends. Must be on the Floor.

H.D. No mopping up provisions. Agreed.

taxation measures. And authy to say so soon.

3. Anglo-Iraqi Treaty.

A.V.A. Agreed. Agreed.

E.B. As in memo.

N.B. Satisfied this wd. do for air bases.

H.D. New financial points to be discussed with Ty.

4. International Meetings.

E.B. Can’t be too rigid. Importance of mtgs. changes. This shd. be taken

UNESCO. has 18 mtgs. planned &amp; a world conference.

E.B. Agree: but it might turn out to be important link – if pol. and

G.T. Have cut our delegn to 50%. Will propose conference every 2 yrs.

Accept Annex B. so far as I’m concerned.

A.B. L.a. conferences – e.g. trams – are being discouraged.

only as a guide.

H.M. Disappointed at result. Many mtgs. in hard-currency countries.

economic organns founder. cf. Cominform.

instead of annually.

Remember too dollars we earn by conferences held in U.K.

310

T.W. Drain on Govt. staffs.

H.M. Too many Dpts. represented.

H.D. Ty. will be helpfully tiresome if Cab. so desire. Approved.

of our Delegn.

N.B. Endorsed that. Results last year – increased food production in

H.D.’s proposal approved – on basis of due balance

[Enter J.S.

5. Trade Negotiations: U.S. Requests on Preferences.

R.S.C. Remember our influence comes fr. strength and competence

other countries.

between latter considerations.

H.W. New compromise offered. S. Rhodesia is one of main importance.

some changes. Tobacco can be accepted subject to long-term

concessions - &amp; that raises ques. what sanctions we can use

U.K. import e.g. canned fruit.

Inverchapel.

R.S.C. Wdn’t have done this except for rubber concession. That wd. be a

Brk-down because unreasonable U.K. attitude wd. be harmful to

T.W. Para. 15 – meaning?

H.W. Further consn shows long-term contract wd. outweigh.

N.B. C.R.O. are sure they will be content if we promise long-term

contract. U.S. must be informed of that in advance.

A.V.A. Only personal offer from a deputy. And Clayton is in bad state

m’tain it’s better than in fact it is.

And U.S. rubber concession is important &amp; immediate.

Discussed with F.O., C.R.O. &amp; M.C.A. Inclined to accept subject to

contract wh. we want anyway. But shd. not offer Colonial

v. U.S. failure on rubber. Intend therefore to seek a sanction on a

Doms. shd. be informed in advance. Reply shd. go thro’

great help, however.

U.S. &amp; Canadian relations.

of mind. How shall we raise it?

R.S.C. Inverchapel to Marshall. Clayton put the breakdown on the

political plane by coming to E.B.

A.B. Support the proposition. But diffy: Clayton wants a scalp &amp; will

311

E.B. Safer therefore to keep it with Marshall. Preferences must contain a

political element.

H.W. May have small trouble with Canada.

Agreed.

6. Economic Recovery of Europe: U.S. Assistance.

R.S.C. As in memo.

P.M. Ques: what strings?

R.S.C. That must await developments.

J. Include paras. in [ ].

E.B. Agreed.

A.B. Hope we aren’t going to draft. R.S.C. in Press conference

foreshadowed more cuts. Shdn’t we be looking at U.S.

purchases again? Are we still buying tobacco? Why?

P.M. We are now examining just that.

Agreed – with additions.

7. Government Bulk Purchase: Food &amp; Materials.

P.M. As in memo.

J.S. In extreme scarcity bulk purchase is inevitable to control imports &amp;

select sources. Had to go back to it e.g. in fruit. Whatever the

merits.

R.S.C. No case for alterations in present circs.

Agreed.

8. Bacon Ration.

J.S. Strike in Canada. Ration must come down to 1 oz. And in 6 wks. we

shd. have to suspend altogether.

Unfortunate on top of other food diffies.

P.M. Cause shd. be clearly stated.

Alternative sources?

312

J.S. None in short-term.

9. Priorities.

Declined to pay ridiculously high Danish prices. That was only 15%.

Note taken.

[Enter Gaitskell: Strauss: Key.

Barnes.

P.M. As in memo.

given special priority. Wd. prefer to do nothing m’while.

Farm-workers. Also concrete sleepers because 20/3/47 mentions

sleepers. Want it clear that subsidiaries are covered too.

R.S.C. Ques. of progressing, not priority.

T.W. Then we shdn’t make big policy announcemts. w’out knowg. how

H.M. Satisfied somethg. more flexible than P.M.’s priority list is essential.

G.S. Practicable to add agriculture, but not exports, to P.M.’s list.

R.S.C. If we add any more, it loses all meaning.

Recommend review of whole ques. Prs. only coal machinery shd. be

C.K. Airey House. Can’t get materials for beams. This holds up bldg. for

only steel rails &amp; can’t get steel for factories for concrete

H.G. Shd. have expert enquiry. V. complicated.

Coal may be special case because fundamental to all.

Mistake to make any announcemt. before studied.

to carry them out.

How long will this enquiry take?

Allocation vice priorities. Progressing is right method &amp; direct Govt. purchase where

P.M. Must change this: but v. quickly. Must be a finer method.

A.B. Favour abolishing priorities because suggest nothg. else matters.

that is essential. Pursuit organisation is what is required.

A.W. Firms can’t discriminate after priority list. They want guidance. Organisn requd to progress more than now wd. be v. large.

B. Need to watch deliveries as against allocations. That is trouble.

R.S.C. That was covered by Cab. approval of new steel scheme.

For priorities prevent system from working.

G.T. Don’t continue or add to priorities until new scheme worked out.

313

G.A.I. Must have priorities for labour. That is in hand.

No announcement yet. Agreed.

10. Prize Money.

[Exit all invitees to date

[Enter 2 Service Ministers.

H. As in memo.

participating.

P.M. Pity this archaism wasn’t abolished between the wars.

H. Yes – in this same Bill

H.D. Annex: para. (b). Mustn’t be suggested Ty. settles – there must

R.A.F. taking 25% by agreement. Doms. &amp; Colonies also

R.S.C. Will now be abolished finally?

P.M. Must be in Bill.

be agreement with Doms. Agreed.

H.M. Ques. of place in programme is for H.P.C. &amp; F.L. Cttee.
