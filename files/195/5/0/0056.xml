C.M. 78(47). 2nd October, 1947.

1. Lord Mayor’s Dinner.

Unbroken for centuries. Pity to stop it.

J.S. Agreed.

P.M. In view of restns have considered ques. of Dinner.

They intend to reduce nos. to 300 &amp; little food. Normal is 750.

R.S.C. See that announcemt. made in advance. J.S. to arrange that.

2. Wedding Present for Princess Elizabeth.

P.M. Grandfather clock Wm IV. or Amboyna wood table. I prefer the table.

P.M.’s advice accepted.

3. Burma: Constitutional Position.

L. As in memo.

P.M. Treaty arrangemts. are going well. Thakin Nu will come to sign

on 17/10.

Good constitution – framed quickly.

A.B. Will they be de facto in Commonwealth?

P.M. No. They regret it, but can’t help it.

R.S.C. They might come back later.

Agreed.

[Enter C.O.S. &amp; Service Ministers.

4. Defence Requirements.

economic sitn.

A.V.A. Balanced forces at £827 m. cd. not be afforded in present

Nor wd. they have yielded man-power contn.

Net redn of 514.000. Redn of 150.000 at 31/3/48. And 100.000 on

prodn. Cpd. with H/C. figure of 7 months ago there will be

increased release to civil work of 250.000.

Acceleration of run-down m’while. Army: 85.000 in June quarter.

Nearly 2/3rds in first 6 months.

Snags. Para. 8 assumes liquidn of commitments. If these don’t

materialise we shall have to review. But Cab. shd. take this risk.

Cost: £710 m. in first memo. to D. Cttee. Not confirmed. But will

304

seek every saving possible. But if man-power plan appd that will

govern vol. of expenditure v. largely.

Trying to find balanced Forces at level of £600 m. in normal year.

Internatl &amp; pol. risks involved. E.g. para. 19: dockyard towns will cause pol. troubles. But in present circs. country can’t afford

all these will have to be done.

targets.

H. We must put action into effect. We shall come down to March figure.

Pacific – commercial and pol. consequences.

aren’t balanced or fit for war in any sense. Will take years to

tidy up.

No margin for unforeseen commitments.

H.D. Support proposals.

Reserve my position. I can’t support exports while w’drawing

H.D. has never given credit for use of Services to relieve civilians.

How much of the 700 m. is substitute for civilian wages?

more.

P.M. Para. 19 was only indicn of possible consequences. Doesn’t follow that

A.V.A. Can’t delay decision on these if Serv. Ministers are to make their

Much of para. 19 must therefore be put into effect at once.

Cab. shd. appreciate pol. &amp; internatl effects. E.g. we are abandoning

Not, however, commd to all para. 19 action.

N.B. More rapid run-down in ‘47’ means discrimination betwn. trades

up to 10 groups.

C.A.S. Recommns based on assumption – no war in 5 yrs. These forces

Problem: age-length of service implications: commitments.

a) Econ. situation. Disappointed at rate of run-down to 713.000.

But accept tht. we can’t.

b) Man-power decisions. Not to be assumed tht. all para. 19

consequences are inevitable. Room for economies

e.g. in static force. Also 300.000 civilians employed –

cuts then wd. balance finance.

c) Reserve posn on finance at £700 m. (?).

E.B. Re-organise quickly – for prestige reasons.

Forces fr. everywhere.

In studying economies, encourage Dpts. If they save somewhere

they shd. have a chance of using it elsewhere.

Want such savings presented properly in future.

H.D. has never given a figure of dollar savings from our foreign policy

&amp; its military support. Nor savings fr. German occupn &amp; p.o.w.

We only get one side of balance sheet. Public shd. be told.

305

Want to think now, not in terms of cutting down, but of bldg. up a

new Army etc. Offence is years ahead of defence. Makes it

All I wanted to make clear was tht. I don’t now

diff. to determine.

P.M. Importance of proper presentn to Parlt. Distinguish terminals.

Show value of work done in bomb clearance etc. Show how

much civil staff requd for increasg. rate of demobiln etc.

Re-consider form of Estimates.

H.D. Anxious to have facts presented properly. accept £711 m.

E.Sh. Expenditure on new prodn. [New warships. H. No.]

Cd. we not defer new prodn &amp; concentrate more of

bodies in R.O.F.’s.

A.V.A. No.

A.V.A. 138.000 Civil Servants.

G.A.I. Announcement. Release p’mme Jan/March. Overseas command,

5 year assumption. M’while re-orgn in weapon prodn.

expendre on research?

A.V.A. It is on this principle we are proceeding. Research people not

yet ready.

E.Sh. 400.000 in R.O.F.’s

A.V.A. Now 350.000 industrials all told.

P.M. Estimate of labour power used in prodn for Services – not no. of

We have cut off much new prodn. Limited to prodn for research &amp;

to m’tain essential capacity. Research expendre higher than in

any peace-time year.

A.B. Strategy being uncertain, tactical weapons can’t be settled.

Research therefore must be fundamental. Common to industry.

A.V.A. Must also continue operational research.

A.B. 300.000 civilians. Were they formerly in uniform?

P.M. Will break this down to show what they are doing.

C.E. Man Power Cttee is looking at both uniformed &amp; civil personnel.

can’t do it unless told at once. But then will leak before Debate

on Address.

F.W.B. We do warn secretly in advance.

306

C.A.S. Must be public announcement.

A.V.A. By 11 or 12 Oct. at latest. And not Groups as whole-

Will make it as late as poss. but must be done before Debate.

F.W.B. Issue = shd. M/L. make public announcement.

Agreed at x/: in principle there must be some explanation

discrimination among trades. Must therefore be publicity.

H. Pacific. Can’t run down unless we notify Commands at once.

We can let Commands know at once. Explain later.

P.M. Better to explain at outset.

E.B. x/ Let A.V.A. agree form of announcement with Service Ministers &amp;

M/Labour.

P.M. Some announcemt. must be made before Parlt. meets.

Must therefore explain.

in announcement.

A.B. Re-grouping training camps. May throw up some new accommn.

Squatters risk. Let civil Dpts. know before camps vacated.

P.M. Already agreed.

[Exit C.O.S. Enter B.

5. Petrol Rationing.

continued. Less than 85.000 galls.

P.M. Black market attraction will increase nos. who draw it.

R.S.C. Make it discretionary – a wide discretion. Agreed.

E.Sh. As in memo. But tourists to have old ration, before recent increase.

F.W.B. End/war leave petrol is on a par with demob. leave. Pledged in

effect. Will end by Apl. ’48. Small amount. Want that

( ? ).

N.B. Want concession a) up to Nov. 30 for men comg. fr. long periods

b) reasonable discretion in allowances.

E.Sh. Defer a decision? about 6 wks.

E.B. That wd. satisfy me. Agreed.

periods overseas.

E.B. Tourists. Favour continuing the allowances.

Leave it as it is now.

A.B. “Deny it to B. &amp; give it to foreigners.” Realise what this means.

307

[Exit B. &amp; Service Ministers.

N.B. Easy to explain. Currency-earning.

[Enter J.W., H.G. &amp; H.M.

6. Control of Steel Distribution. Favour c).

ii) Inspection. Appointmt of no. of inspectors to travel the country &amp;

iii) Prohibition of over-authorisation by Dpts. Ministers must see that

officials don’t do this.

vi) Collaboration with major steel-using industries thro’ their trade

J.W. Agree.

R.S.C. Agree.

H.M. Will use it.

Or not cancelling all back-orders? Set them v. later allocns.

H.W. 6 months’ delay. During that, shall we get proper priority?

J.S. Stressed para. 5. re

H.M. Proposals a) Holiday b) Cancel back-log c) New currency.

watch working of scheme.

iv) Old orders must be re-scrutinised, from angle of new situation &amp;

cancel those which are no longer important.

v) Tighter control of end-products by Dpts. Stress para. 5.

With strong money demand you can’t hope to enforce this

scheme.

associations. Must have good will of industry.

1/4/48 late date for new currency. Shd. have liked it earlier.

J.W. So wd. I. But we can’t.

A.B. Experience in M/H.

H.G. Agree. But it’s a diff. business.

T.W. Considered earlier delivery of special products?

Can we get steel firms to help m’while?

H.G. Will discuss with R.S.C. and H.W.

G.T. Over-authorisation. Offenders will get advantage in next 6 months?

H.M. No. Will have to re-authorise out of new allocations.

inflation. Importance of reducing monetary

demand for less essential products contg. steel.
