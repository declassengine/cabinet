A.V.A. Draw special attentn. to:-

Para 14. 1.427.000 is missing figure. P.M.’s statement was 1.087.000. This surplus in W.O. has enabled Sys. to promise (to-day) to reach Gp. 53 by 8.7.47 vice 51. May be similar advance in 2nd half year.

V. little refce. to Commonwealth Defence. Discussed with A. in light of criticisms in Defence debate by Chatfield etc. He is anxious for us to omit. Suggd. tht. in para. 10(x) we add words referring to preservation of links with Commonwealth.

In that event we must chair issue with Opposn. leaders.

E.B. Clause in Mil. Training Act 1939.

Agreed : 5 years + renewal by resolution for period (not limited to one year).

b) Release to Reserves. N.B. seeking a formula requiring an equivalent no. of hours. He can’t

do it.

N.B. Initial and basic training will take 1 yr. In Reserve we cd. keep them up

to that, but not to a higher standard. If we tried 10 mos of applied

training we shd. get no dividend fr. addl. overheads.

A.V.A. Breaks across principle of equality of sacrifice i.e. Air Miny. requirement does.

Still wants to release pilots and navigators to Reserve after 12 mos.

Equality of sacrifice met because air crew requd. to do more than Army in 6 years of Reserve via 5½ years.

F.J.B. 60 days in 5½. Air crew will do 216 days over 6.

N.B. Casualty risk has also to be taken into a/c.

similar.

J.W. Edn. Ministers want to be relieved of their statutory responsibilities.

A.V.A. Defence Group of Party will be influenced by incln. in Bill of provn. re. educn.

R.A.F. all voluntary, however. Clear need for co-ordn. But on main ques. raised, Service Dpts. shd. accept some responsibility on lines of Educn. Acts. 115

J.W. Provided financial provn. is clear.

H.D. Don’t want overlapping. Pity to cut it right out of l.a. responsibility.

Wd. look at incidence of cost, where a camp puts big burden on l.a.

A.V.A. My plan meets pol. diffy. subject to adjustment of finance.

C.E. Put the duty on Services. Provide tht. where l.a. is used it shall be indemnified v. extra cost incurred.

P.M. a) Educn. must be provided. b) Serv. Estimates must carry cost. c) L.a. use as agent needn’t involve them in cost.

F.J.B. Can’t discharge this oblign. overseas.

P.M. Everything is subject to what is practicable.

Agreed : examine details, approve principle above.

g) Theological Students.

G.A.I. Diff. views held by C/E and on other hand R.C. and Jews.

Cd. this be left to a free Vote?

Agreed: no statutory exemption shd. be given.

A.G. Publn. of Bill. Preferable not to publish before Debate on Def. W. Paper.

F.J.B. But before Service Estimates.

6. Cyprus.

C.J. Decln. may help us to go on with reforms. Can’t get on w’out it.

Recognise force of E.B.’s view. Don’t ask immed. decln. (because of Sudan and Burma.) But Cab. shd. be aware of diffies. of reform if none is made.

Deputn. fr. Cyprus. Likely to start no co-opn. campaign.

Lead by Gk. Church. Didn’t include Turks.

E.B. Bad history. Ty. bled Cyprus for years. Was a scandal. This is result. Raised many times – hints fr. Russia. Egypt, Pal, E. Med. all to be settled.

May be right in the end to create Reg. Defence – in wh. Cyprus wd. settle itself.

116

Favour agreeing with Gk. Govt. tht. neither they nor we will raise this issue for a no. of years. Think I can get Gks. to agree.

Announcement will start a blaze. R. wd. be on our backs. For 12 mos. they wdn’t yield on Dodecanese because wanted a base in Rhodes. If Cyprus is raised, there will be demand to return to Greece and demilitarise – as agreed for Dodecanese.

[Exit A.B.

Must play for time – until we know where we are.

Try for agreemt. with Greece for status quo for 10 years, at end of which they wd. be free to determine own future.

H.D. Plan now to spend £6 m. Can’t afford that if they are leaving Empire.

Want to know first if they will stay on.

C.J. £2½ m. fr. Col. Fund. Gk. P.M. has encouraged the movement.

Advance constitl. changes : go slow with economic development.

A.V.A. Diff. to make publ. announcement. But let Cab. decide how to keep Cyprus. “Scuttle argument”.

C.A.S. Loss of mil. facilities in Cyprus wd. be v. serious even for U.K. defence.

P.M. Agree you can’t have unilateral public decln.

But we must rally islanders – to wish to remain in Commonwealth.

H.D. Put it across tht. they won’t get any money unless they do.

C.J. We try. But they are emotional over Greece.

N.B. Cyprus not best base in Med.

Basis w’out good will not be v. valuable.

Can get bases with good will from Greece.

In 1919 we recognised Gk. claim subject to Ital. recognn. of Gk. claim to Dodecanese.

A firm decln. wd. provoke an explosion.

Relevant of Fr. sitn. = we forced them out of Levant States.

J. Disagree with that. Agree with A.V.A. Between 15-30% are Turks.

Island be-devilled with politics. Concentrate on econom. development.

This looks like our last base for M/E.

Decide now not to contemplate leaving, even after 10 years.

P.M. Agree : no public decln. Otherwise, no decision.
