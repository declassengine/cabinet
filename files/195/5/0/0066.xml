1. Resignation of H. Dalton: Demand for Select Cttee.

[Enter W.W.

P.M. V. gt. loss to Govt. V. gt. sympathy (agreed).

If we refuse, will look as tho’ we have somthg. to hide.

There is a case for other view. Tho’ H.D.’s personal view makes it

First instinct: this was Tory effort to hit a man when he’s down.

Our supporters may think we are on the run – leavg. H.D. to the

Might rally Party to take that line.

When Cttee meets, may be some awkward points. Ministers cdn’t v.

Shd. conduct of journalist be subject of enquiry? Is it worth while

J. Support this v. strongly. Knock on the head idea tht. there is

Enquiry. Nothg. to enquire into. But Tories intend to press it.

Letter from H.D. – hope you will allow Cttee w’out

hesitn if Tories press for it.

Propose to say: no dispute over facts but if wanted won’t resist.

H.M. Discussed with P.M. &amp; W.W. Friday a.m.

awkward.

No reason to believe anythg. else in it.

wolves.

If, however, other allegns: we cd. agree to Cttee. Put onus on them to

show what Cttee has to enquire into.

x/ well be members.

to have enquiry into that?

E.B. What t. of r.? Limited to this incident?

R.S.C. From H.D.’s angle better have it settled. Otherwise, gossip will get

out of hand.

somethg. behind it.

Put onus on Tories: but let them have it if they insist.

P.M. Will say H.D. wd. welcome it.

G.T. x/ Some Minister shd. be on Cttee – to watch interest of H.D. &amp; Govt.

A.B. Agree with P.M.’s view. Say: can’t see purpose of it, but if Tories

want it we will readily give it.

Seek early chance of social mtg. with H.D. e.g. Cab. give him a dinner.

T.W. Stop our people from starting a debate on it.

C.E. Genl. feeling of sympathy – W.S.C. was right in his magnanimity

on Thurs. p.m. Cd. P.M. allude to W.S.C.’s attitude?

N.B. May be something in Press point.

354

P.M. Procdgs. under Off. Secrets Act (v. both H.D. &amp; journalist) are a

matter for L.O.’s – not for Govt. or Parlt.

Agreed: as in P.M.’s proposal.

2. Savoy Hotel Strike.

violence.

Then Wontner wrote threateng. dismissal: &amp; in view of that

Trouble due: Lewis and Wontner: both unwise.

C.E. Dispute for about 2 wks. Not a large propn of workers are in

sympathy.

Lewis M.P. has tried to enlist sympathy other Unions, esp.

those with Communist bias. One of aims is to carry dispute

into Wedding week.

Savoy generates own electricity – needed for water &amp; sewerage. If

oil supplies cut, hotel cdn’t work. Last week, Wed., 2 lorries

arrived: Lewis talked to both drivers: first delivered the oil:

second was going to do so when pickets lay on ground behind

lorry. Driver not prepd to injure pickets and drove away.

Police removed: no power to arrest picket unless offers

Posn: unless oil delivered by to-day hotel wd. close. Ldn. drivers

have refused. Sunday a.m. 3 lorries came from Lancs. before

day-break. Pickets again lay down, were removed – more than

once. Crowd. 3 offrs. drew truncheons – 2 or 3 people v.

slightly injured incldg. Asst. Secy. C.S.C.A., who was acting

as volunteer picket.

G.A.I. Trouble for many months. Nat. Arbitn Tribunal advised P. shd. be

re-instated. Savoy said this was illegal: &amp; High Ct. have since

upheld that. They offered to pay his salary for a time &amp; have in

fact paid £175: now sacked him.

Lewis then called them out. More have gone on working than have

come out.

M/L. have apptd court of enquiry. Union then decided it’s

unoffl. strike. Lewis, tho’ official of Union, counselled strike.

Union made it official strike.

Volunteer pickets – mainly from Communist T.U.’s.

P. planted there by C. Party. Said to have bn. interned 18 B.

H.M. Prob. as Italian, not 18 B.

Court/Enquiry shd. finish v. soon. Wontner has agreed to accept

its report. T.U. haven’t. But believe they will.

C.E. May be raised in H/C. to-day by Private Notice Ques.

My line, to W.S.C. h’to has been: no part of Police duty to take sides

in industrial dispute, but shall keep traffic flowing on highway.

A.B. Danger if C. Party get control over Ldn. hotels. Managers open to

blackmail. Centre for espionage etc.

355

E.B. Danger of Moscow stirring up trouble because our refusal to come in

with their political line. Timed to Nov. mtg. of C.F.M.

M. threatened Bidault with this, in effect, when we wdn’t agree

with R. on Marshall Plan.

Labour Party must be on their toes – esp. in strengthening T.U.

posn – and standing out v. unofficial strikes.

A.B. Won’t get so far in U.K. as in France &amp; Italy. T.U. weapon wd.

break in their hands. Their influence, if over-called wd.

disappear.
