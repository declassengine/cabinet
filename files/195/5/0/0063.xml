1. Parliament.

Hyderabad: Monckton staying on another 10 days. Some hope

of agreement.

3. Civil Aviation.

H.M. May be awkward Debate over Nathan + personal aircraft.

won’t pay.

E.B. No. employed in R.A.F. was 14 on ground. Civil: greatly in excess.

Parly. Secy. badly cornered. Shd. be looked into.

Activities of Air Bds. will cause trouble. Can’t hope to make every

route pay. Cross B’tol channel route stopped on basis it alone

M/C.A. putting up v. long answers to P.Q.’s.

Then Nathan’s tour on top of it. Sounded v. bad.

H.D. N. spoke to me before he went: important trip: special aircraft.

Surprised at cost, after the event.

E.B. No H/C. sense in their dealing with P.Q.’s.

A.B. Don’t be panicked. a) Is M/C.A. not to fly on routes he is trying to

organise? b) Shd. M/C.A. go by surface routes? c) On public

service he wd. be displacg. other passengers. d) What of

W.S.C.’s expenses e.g. in going to S. France at end of war.

Compute cost of that.

A. Supported A.B.’s view. Minister shd. go &amp; see for himself. Nothing

to apologise for.

H.M. S.I.M. Cttee can consider the points about the Boards.

P.M. { I will see M/C.A. re Parliamentary situation.

{ S.I.M. Cttee to consider ques. of administration

{ of Airways Corporation.

{ Staffing of M/C.A.

346

G.T. Wider issue. We are being attacked for spending money which

Tory Govts. spent as a matter of course. And from Front

Opposition Bench.

H.M. Seek wider opportunity on adjournment: &amp; let A.B. speak.

H.D. Bds. shd. take this up. B.O.A.C. not v. loyal to idea of public service.

A.W. H.M. might look into behaviour of B.O.A.C. in seeking to frustrate

After consideration by S.I.M. Cttee.

H.W. Cd. P.M. consider ques. of flight of small planes for Govt. use?

Use of private charter planes v. expensive e.g. last summer.

N.B. R.A.F. don’t want too heavy a commitment for civilian V.I.P.’s

But they do it well (Transport Command) &amp; cd. do some.

If not, Bds. shd. run a flight – on model of Transpt. Command.

Govt. decisions.

P.M. We must discuss these ques. further in presence of M/C.A.
