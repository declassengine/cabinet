C.M. 31(47) 21st March 1947

Coal : Imports from U.S.A.

P.M. Fuel Cttee decision. C.B. telegram. Told E.Sh. to say nil in debate.

Misconceptions by E.B. a) We aren’t proposing to go behind

E.L.O.

c) We’ve taken a/c of oil conversion

Is it worth while, for this, to upset Europe – and Bidault.

Last year Coal Cttee apprd. weren’t complied with. Cd. have done

much better myself.

N.C.B. doing a routine job : they can’t have same urgency, as I and

Cab. over prodn. He must have someone who can ques. his whole mind

to prodn. I can’t at present because legn - Coal and Electricity.

Rationing : 1½ tours at most : a few days’ prodn. Go for more

production and concentrate on that.

Thus, even if it only yields 600.000 t. in the end, v. adverse effects if

we now give impn. we aren’t bothering to seek any new sources to

relieve situatn.

Bidault’s objing. But he is all out to get all he can for France.

J. Supported this. All that E.Sh. says can be done in addn. &amp; shd be.

T.W. Support E.Sh. idea of touring country.

Don’t expect too much from it, must rely mainly on own prodn.

b) Deficit is 20 m.

d) Total of miners aren’t all at face : and anyway we have asked them to work harder.

E.Sh. I largely agree with E.B. Have always believed miners can produce the coal. Confirmed with offls : they don’t dispute you cd. get 1 m. tons this year if you placated E.L.O. But more likely you will get only 600.000.

Last year I concentrated on getting prodn.. Got better spirit – wh. led to increased prodn. at end/year. Man power increase much greater than estimated.

Seeing Lemass today. Will bargain coal for Irish labour.

Believe we can get more than 200 m. But give me a free hand.

Let me concentrate on this – relieve me of other duties and give me a free hand. I must tour the country.

R.S.C. Industry’s condn. today. Cotton = ⅓ of pre-crisis output. Midlands working 3 days a wk.

Neglect any method of getting coal : industry will flop. Serious psychol. effect. apart fr. factual position.

Nos. unempld. - no measure of fall in prodn.

But not inconsistent to tap other sources.

171

P.M. Cttee : he needed help of other Dpts : Cttee was to give it to him : cdn’t

have done these things himself.

Remember psychol. of country. Strong arguments needed to show why

we shdn’t get coal fr. all poss. sources.

Assistce. : use Parly. Secy. to the full.

Small amounts – all are small : the aggregate counts. This is object of B.A. technique. Govt. is co-operative.

E.B. doesn’t appreciate facts. And over-estimates diffies. for him.

Some indies. must have 100 m. That means for others a cut of nearly

60%.

E.Sh. First thing : square U.S. first : see if they will take initiative.

A. Lemass is likely to collaborate in getting Irish labour.

C.J. Looking into possibilities from Nigeria and Borneo.

R.S.C. Cd. go to Gib.

O.S. We don’t qualify for an allocn. from E.C.O. – as producer. Shd. have to

ask for alteration of basis of allocn.

E.Sh. We cd. do a bargain over Ruhr coal.

Mid-day sport eg. Cd. E.Sh deal with that alone

Can’t rely wholly on faith in miners’ output.

A. How does this relatively small shortfall have the devastating effects on industry described by R.S.C.

R.S.C. 26.4 m. requirements of industry for summer. Shortage 8.8 m. = ⅓

Fear shan’t get much from S. Africa.

P.M. Every little helps.

P.M. Project is addl. exports w’out altering existg. allocns.

R.S.C. Anyway, let’s try. Don’t say our foreign policy won’t allow us to maintain our industries.
