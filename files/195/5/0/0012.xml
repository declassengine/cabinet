C.M.12 (47) 27th January 1947

1. Burma.

P.M. Agreement early this a.m. with majority of Burma Delegation.

2 members of B. Delegn. dissented at point of announcement.

Clear tht. they were playing Burma politics – and evading responsibility.

Right course : go along with those who will take responsibility.

Statement follows v. closely line taken with India.

Outlined main points in statement. Constituent Assembly : interim Legislature nominated there from: de facto. powers of Govt – no more, no less than India (para. 4) : to mark B’s external posn. as a nation. High Commd. and diplom. relations and efforts to get repn. in international bodies : defence : Frontier Areas – free intercourse and

Conference at Paulong (para. 8) – essential point is that they shd. decide how they be associated with C.A. in interim period : finance (Annex B.) agreed with H.D.

To be signed this p.m. by me and Anng San. To be reported to Parlt. tomorrow.

Wd. be useful if Bottomley went out to Paulong Conference. Wd. re-assure tribes, also Burmans who fear we are separating them for “imperial” reasons.

P.L. Indian parallel : conventn. tht. Govt wdn’t normally preside. Para. 4(a) included warning tht. this may have reactions in India – because it is not current practice there. Because India never had Govt. at centre. Burma did and claim we can’t go back on what they had (and India never there to take).

C.J. Will Frontier status be forced in?

P.M. No: they will be free to choose own fate.

J. Legn.?

P.M. Not immediately.

P.M. Form of announcement in Parlt. Short oral statement and laying full text.

A.G. Print as W. Paper – to go into Vote Office as soon as short oral statement made.

P.M. Consult (or inform) other Parties today. Burma Off. to draft.

(5 p.m.)

R.S.C. One day Debate.

H.D. P’pone that until after they are back in Burma.

74

P.M. Agreed. Not for 2-3 weeks anyway : and adjust to situation in Burma.

H.D. Finance satisfactory. Tin T???? v. sensible no huge figures demanded.

Believe a further £4.5 m. this year will suffice.

Glad to have protected B. taxpayer.

Need for good financial official in Burma, to keep a hold on this.

2. Egypt.

E.B. Must make statement in H/C. today. Internal politics in E. made progress impossible. Broke on point that we wd. not bind ourselves to oppose Sudan’s independence.

Must announce break down.

H.D. Expn. of request. Good point to break on, if break must come.

3. Palestine. Collins case.

P.M. We can’t yield to blackmail.
