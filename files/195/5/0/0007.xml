C.M. 7(47) 16th January 1947

1. Road Transport Strike.

G.A.I. Mtg. again today. Told Deakin to say I had undertaken a) secure early mtg. of J.I.C.

y/ b) Keep them at it. c) Intervene if they break down. He is pleased at that.

Serious extension y’day.

Tho’ 6 Unions involved only T.G.W. failing to hold their men.

P.M. What do you mean by c)?

G.A.I. Might appoint Ct. of Enquiry – fact finding. Evershed wd. provide.

Ques. shd. that be done before men go back.

Cdn’t have done so while R.N. Wages Bd. held field. Can in theory when J.I.C. apptd.

Also propose to summon this pm. Executive of T.G.C.

Saw T.U.C. last night. They fear if we intervene while men out, authy. of T.U.’s will be undermined.

A.G. Doubtful about Ct. of Enquiry. Diff. to go back on policy of no negotn. while on strike.

R.S.C. Wd. be done at request of J.I.C.

A.V.A. Cd. say will be held, at request, if men go back.

A.B. Reason for not acting until men go back = that men haven’t used negotiating machinery. Here they have. Machinery dilatory.

Ct. wd. be fatal – after 7 days of strike Govt. intervene to find facts!

Wd. be said we shd. have known facts long since.

Apptmt. of J.I.C. itself wd. be sufficient “gesture”.

G.A.I. Extension : none in Ldn. save Tilbury.

1.300 in Bristol. N. Reg. no change. Scotl. 250 more.

A.B. Alum. house factory in B’tol will close in 48 hrs.

C.E. Ministerial Cttee y’day.

4.480 lorries will be provided by Services + drivers for another 520 = 5000.

Their use will depend on accommn. etc. and no more than 2.000 can be used in Ldn. Ordered plan to proceed.

Situation if v. substantial cessn of motor transport throughout U.K. Ques. then of obtaining volunteer drivers. First response wd. be from “Fascists”. May be ugly scenes. a) How to recruit? M/L. machinery shdn’t be used because damage to its conciliatory functions. Diff. however, to find alternative.

40

R.S.C. What about Food Offices.

C.E. We invite Cab to decide. b) Power stations. c) Docks : cold stores. d) Roads in Kent. e) Strikers telling troops tht. employers aren’t paying for mil. transport. In fact they pay at least as much. Statement to that effect shd. be made on Cab. authy.

J.S. From Friday am. ques. will be different. H’to moved 20.000 t. p. wk. of meat and groceries. Future lift needed : 65.000 t. needing 5.000 lorries.

Because will have to move flour, potatoes. Services cd. nearly meet that but wd. have no margin for Provinces or for non food.

9 days supply of flour if all mills stopped.

From Frid. am we shd. have to begin moving groceries fr. Ldn. to Provinces : to re-route foods to rlways : to clear rail- heads (esp. pots and vegetables) : get mil. labour to work docks. All these avoided h’to as provocation.

Cdn’t therefore expect to carry on even with maximum mil. mobilisation of 5.000 lorries and shd. have to invite civilian volunteers.

Barnes. Organn. and powers available : want now decisions re manning.

P.M. Any b’cast appeals by Unions.

T.W. Have T.U.C. repves. tried to get settlement.

G.A.I. No : no contact until I saw them last pm. Asked them then to make some approach to Unions.

Cdn’t we use l.a. resources in vans and drivers. Isn’t this best method of getting volunteers, if we have to.

E.Sh. Vital point : must employ volunteer labour if it goes on. That is black-leg labour. Wd. be disastrous. Can’t face it in existing circs. Men have good case : negotns. delayed. Shd. put to T.U.C. tht. if we are forced to use vol. labour may affect fabric of T.U. movement. Shd. therefore adopt abnormal procedure. J.I.C. are to consider facts and make a decision : let us secure that they make it quickly. Point of diffce. is only wthr. J.I.C. shd. consider before or after men go back to work. In my experience this argument rarely gets them back unless they get a hint.

P.M. shd. meet T.U.C. tell them implications : get 2 sides together : tell them J.K. will meet and decide and announce it to men.

Alternative : black-leg labour causing extension of strike..

G.A.I. If Cab. feel we shd. so press J.K. I can do so w’out seeing T.U.C. They are mtg. at 5 pm today. If T.U. can’t control members. Govt. can’t allow people to starve. We have given T.G.W. their chance.

41

Shall I tell J.K. to negotiate? If they won’t Govt can refer to arbitration.

Of if employers on J.K. won’t agree, workers can come to Govt. and we can refer to arbitration.

Risk of such action is encouraging other industries to ignore Union leaders.

x/ May I tell Strikers Cttee this pm. that J.K. will start to negotiate at 5 pm.

T.W. Shdn’t T.U.C. be represented at 2 pm. mtg? They have responsibility.

P.M. Depends on psychology of Unions.

C.J. This Union wd. re-act v. badly against bringing in T.U.C.

A.B. Support x/. This wd. stop an extension : might get the men back.

What is legal posn.?

J. Under Act of 1920 you can make a Proclamation : summon Parlt. w’in 5 days : then powers to regulations. Merit wd. show strikers they are striking v. State, not employers.

Alternatively D.R. 58A.

P.M. M/L. to send message thro’ Deakin to mtg. at 2 pm. tht. J.I.C. will begin to negotiate at 5 pm. today.

A.V.A. Need to restore authy. of T.U. leaders. Wd. they favour J.I.C. going on?

G.A.I. z/ Was argued last night : they were against J.I.C. going on, in unofficial strike.

P.M. We have given T.U. its chance. Can’t wait any longer.

A.V.A. I wd. prefer to stick to y/. On principle of not intervening while men are out.

A.B. Then they will stay out until they know what decision is.

G.A.I. Then let me proceed as at y/ - saying it’s on authy. of Govt.

Basis : J.I.C. to commence their negotns.. tho’ men have not gone back, but not promise decision tonight. You don’t then decide before they go back : only begin discussing it.

E.W. Fear they will stand out for a decision – another day.

E.Sh. Is it clear that Deakin will say : J.I.C. will begin negotns. at 5pm. you go back to work and discns. will go back. (Discuss issues in dispute).

42

This is a change if Deakin is going to do it – for h’to the Union has bn. unwilling to agree to that.

G.A.I. He is willing.

A.V.A. Have employers agreed?

G.A.I. Thro’ their Secretary.

H. This is complete reversal of Govt. policy. Trouble with Unions, esp. if men don’t go back. Can’t believe T.U.C. wd. agree to this policy. They shd. be consulted, not merely informed.

E.Sh. But Deakin has admitted change in policy.

H.McN We shall be in a mess if employers refuse to discuss on J.I.C. until men go back.

P.M. In view of z/ you must carry T.U.C. with you first.

Barnes. Before you decide to take over this industry, reflect. Over 12 mos. growing policy in T.G.W. Union to go in for unofficial strikes : they realise they are getting more by this method than thro’ Union. If we take over sections of this industry because limited dispute : then do we do it again if dockers come out in a months’ time. When do we get to write our Bill.

Surely T.U.C. shd. take this up with T.G.W. Union, whose action will bring down organised labour.

C.E. Suggest that if this strike goes on today, we use 1920 Act tomorrow.

H.D. Greatest calamity wd. be voluntary labour w’out having taken industry over.

G.A.I. Message from Gould : employers have not agreed to begin negotiating.

A.B. Then let Deakin try y/ without any Govt. - authority on his own.

P.M. See what happens today.

If strike goes on, Procln. under Act of 1920 [and take industry over.]

A.V.A. Be careful over [ ]. Proviso v. industrial conscription.

How wd. you work the industry if you “took it over”.

A.B. Depends what Regn. you make.

A. Don’t act w’out consultn. with T.U.C.

43

P.M. Yes : but not too early.

G.A.I. Told y’day Govt. must m’tain essential services.

If you take over industry, will you tell them to go back and await settlement on assurance of arbitration.

H.McN Consider posn. if we take over and they don’t go back.

J.S. What are we prepared to offer them?

E.Sh. Only a tribunal of arbitration.

Conclns. This pm – no message from Govt. Deakin to act on

own authority.

I.E. Cttee to meet this pm – with J. – to consider

actions on 1920 Act and services ques.

*Deakin also to say this. T.U.C. to be infd. by G.A.I. if we are to use 1920 Act

*M/F. to issue quietly statement about paymt. for mil. transport.

2. Economic Survey for 1947. Exit A.

R.S.C. Situation serious. Trying to do too much. Labour shortage getting worse. Must act to avoid gap closing in random shortages.

Balance/payments : para 5. We may have to export*goods even if heavy demand for them in U.K. 117% of pre-war volume : diff. to increase that.

* both consumer and capital goods.

Six main recommns.

a) Size of Armed Forces and supply. 1.4 m. by end 1947, as cpd. with 1.568 m. by 31.3.48. as recommended to Def. Cttee. This is only one contribn. twds. the gap.

b) Employment of Women. It is among women’s indies tht. “man power” shortage is so acute – beginning to train men for women’s jobs! Plan : single women to be directed to work of natl. importance, tho’ volunteering for Armed Forces will be allowed in lieu.

This wd mean i) more in total ii) chance of getting them into places where most requd. eg. get them out of engineering into textiles.

c) School-leaving age. Main argument = economic. Legn. requd.

Sept. wd. be final date. 160.000 wd. be added thereby to labour force. Labour force must include propn. of juveniles if they weren’t there, adults wd. have to do their work.

d) Coal : Reservation from call-up. Potent factor in recruiting for mines if reserved exclusively for underground mining.

44

e) Engineering : (para. 36). Overmanned, esp. in female labour.

Scheme requd. for slimming it. b) would largely meet it.

f) Target for bldg. labour to be reduced. Target rather than real

adjustment. But wd. relieve gap by 70.000.

Depl. estimates based on man power shortage. Even if we fill gap therefore we shall still feel drafts.

A no. of ancillary proposals. Prs. most important –

g) Reduction in National Govt. Staffs. and Local Govt. Staffs.

h) Paras 14 and 29. Polish labour. 100.000 in 1947 as a target.

Don’t think we shd. try for other foreign labour until we have

absorbed Poles. If we can, then d.p.’s

i) Equipment for coal. Special priority. In hand?

j) Housing for coal and agriculture.

k) Para 34. Generating plan for electricity. ) in

l) Allocation of steel. ) hand

m) Para. 40 Labour saving appliances in bldg.

n) Factories in development areas.

Paras. 54/5. White Paper. Repn. must start at once if debate in 2nd half of Feby. Scheme of draft outlined (as in memo).

Need authy. soon to proceed with drafting.

This is concerted plan – interdependent – depends largely on doing all we recommend. If so, fair chance of getting thro’ 1947.

P.M. Short general discn. Then main points. At 9 pm tonight.
