C.M. 72 (47) 19th August, 1947 1.

Balance of Payments.

E.E.B. Read text of Washington telegram 4542.

P.M. Drain since week-end has bn. less than we feared.

160. Mon. for week-end.: 16 Mon: estimate 30 to-day.

A.V.A. Then 24 hrs. delay might cost us 30m. dollars.

H.D. Arithmetic: 30 m. or so risk against 500m. remanent of loan. Worth while. Political: cleavage in U.S. administration. Snyder is anxious to help (cf. first para. of telegram). Lovett, however, is awkward.

Advise W.E. another 24 hrs. allowed; but that is absolute limit – he must get the best he can w’in that time.

A.B. Effect of conditions?

E.B. Art. 8(2) (b). 1. Fund Agreemt. Art 14 permits countries in b/paymts. diffies to impose restrns on current transactions. Art. 8 (2) (b) is more in our favour if U.S. wd. agree to it.

Art. 3 on purposes: admission by U.S. tht. these were being defeated.

This wd. be valuable to us. Art. 8 (2) (b) then = cover for letting us out.

A.B. We may therefore be able to reach agreement with U.S. tht. purposes of Loan are frustrated. Then they can dispense with Congress.

J. Give 24 hrs.

On amounts: everyone is expecting trouble. Can’t we assume tht. all that’s ready for conversion has gone?

H.D. That’s Bank’s advice. But don’t rely on it overmuch. For this is continuous process.

A.B. What of remainder of Credit. Shall we able to draw only on conditions.

H.D. No. Issue is only – can we draw on Loan only on notifications already made. If we get U.S. acquiescence we can continue to draw on Credit. 500 still not notified.

E.B. Para. 6 of telegram. State Dpt. is trying to freeze the 500m. as a bargaining card. Tradition in State Dpt.

H.D. Exact amounts of drawing 11/8: 150. Notice of another 150 on 21/8: and further 150 on 25/8. Then we shd. have 500 left.

279

E.B. Can’t have that stop. Wd. frustrate our stand-still measures.

Agreed: Telegraph to W.E. authy for final extension of 24 hrs. U.S. have learned not to burn fingers with interference with other

people’s economic institutions.

H.W. Australia will soon be approachg. us for long-term wheat agreemt.

H.D. Wd. welcome that: safer (climatically) than Russia.

A.B. Must be linked with assurances of receivg. our manufactured goods,

both from Australia &amp; Canada.

E.B. Favour opening future markets over 30/40 per cent of market.

E.B. Then let Ty. give W.E. help on Art. 8 (2) (b) and Art. 3. Tell him we like that. Alas we can’t buy U.S. acquiescence at price of blocking remainder of Credit.

A.B. Cd. we incite Washington to deny statements that Snyder is pressing W.E. on B. economy? Telegraph. Prevent bad blood.

E.B. Leave that to me. Will see what can be done.

P.M. Must avoid people talking about 1931.

H.D. Once we have announced our action, it will be easier to get right kind of statements made.

E.B. Layton v. embittered. Chronicle &amp; Telegraph v. bad.

P.M. Equality of treatment of sterling area.

Figures given by H.M. were wrong.

Amount not more than 20 out of 100 for sterling areas.

We are therefore not puttg. bar on sterling countries – merely asking them to show restraint in drawing on dollars.

H.D. Helpful action by Australia. Chiffley has made good use of P.M.’s letter &amp; has announced cuts in dollar expenditure.

E.B. Diversion to India was to have bn. one harvest only. We have contd it for 2. Australia risking their future trade in cause of Commonwealth.

A.B. Are we going to try to get U.K. – U.S. trade on commercial basis, by commodities, instead of filtering it all thro’ Loan Agreement.

P.M. We are considering it.

Bulk purchase with 60% of field: open market for rest. 280

A.B. B. financing of W. Hemisphere was contd on basis of intermittent bankruptcies – wh. had no pol. significances because they were of individual capitalists. Now all loans are Govt. loans it’s more dangerous.

A.V.A. Danger of bulk-buying by Govts. Pol. pressure. V. grave in crisis. Futures markets over part of field – wd. need to be studied as long-term Commonwealth issue.

C.R.A. Make a study of bulk buying: timber &amp; wheat.

T.W. Diffies in producer countries – because Govt. are buying &amp; re-selling at higher prices.

J.W. We have some good angles buying timber:

A.B. Lets study default by U.S. on debt to Western World.

H.W. Non-discriminn. I.T.O. Conference.

No prior approval before March 1952. Discriminate subject to posterior approval: &amp; no diffy. in voting that down.

Freedom to do what we like up to end of 1948 – conceded to French and must therefore be given to us too.

Thus, up to end 1948 complete freedom to discriminate (under I.T.O. charter). From there to Mar. 1952 countries in b/p. diffies can discriminate subject to subsequent complaint &amp; being told to stop. Our protection – a) vote it down. b) leave I.T.O. in 60 days.
