C.M. 41(47) 29th April 1947

1. Dockers’ Strike.

G.A.I. No extension on balance : some back, others out.

Private notice ques. today.

Real facts. Decasualisation Bill necessitated review of staffing : redundancy disclosed : Union saw no objn. : Glasgow redundancy 900 – decided to dismiss 500, then strike called by Sc. brk. away Union. 296 of men concerned had joined docks post-war : agreed they shd. go before 204 who were there pre-war. M/L. offered further enquiry : 296 being re-employed m’while 204 restored to register.

T&amp;G workers have men well in hand. But Ldn. stevedores have come out to make it more diff. for Union.

Dock authorities must stand firm.

J.S. Food : one week’s interruptn. can be tolerated. Thereafter, troops to unload etc.

G.A.I. Movement to encourage workers to ignore Union advice.

J. Gas strike.

A.B. How long continued negotns. Cdn’t M/L “Progress” these negotns.?

G.A.I. Tried to speed up : but risk of forcing bad settlements if you insist on time limit.

P.M. But M/L. shd. keep in touch : must be able to watch posn.

Unions shd. also keep men informed of progress.

G.A.I. Will take these points up with N.J.A.C.

H.M. Govt. will have to take firmer line with these strikes. a) 5 day : 40 hour week : we can’t afford it in many industries. b) Cotton settlement based on more pay for less output. c) Billingsgate : no justification for claim to vet promotions.

Shd. we not meet T.U.’s and tell them they are wrecking the economy.

A.B. Agree with those concns. but they are no reason for protracted negotns.

Better to bring them to an issue. Building decision reached v. the appln. that puts onus on the men.

E.Sh. Perspective : much better than after last war.

T.U. leaders wd. reply i) do inform members. ii) Not easy to rush negotiations. iii) Men have bn. led to expect “workers control”.

226

2. Palestine : Submission to United Nations.

Mc.N. I considered promises re our attitude to decision shd. be reserved until forced out. But thought it wd. be forced out.

Now E.B.’s view – in telegram 679 from Berlin.

Then I wd. omit “sole” before “judge”.

I myself think this will be diff. for Cadogan.

P.M. Agree with E.B. Why shd. we alone promise to carry out decision.

a) What is our policy? b) Shall we accept decision? c) Will we implement?

Surely we can’t avoid promising to accept b). What point in referring it to U.N. We then get no finality : what advantage to us.

We shall only be leaving onus of decision with ourselves.

C.J. Our statements in Parlt. assumed we wd. accept the decision : tho’ no commitment v. enforcement.

Para. 7. will do to begin with. But Cadogan will be pressed to go further : and if F.O. give consent, he cd. speak as in para. 4.

N.B. Cadogan’s judgement is good : don’t lightly disregard his advice.

If a real plan emerges, we shd. want to accept it.

Can’t we say : want to bring world opinion to bear to induce agreement between J. and A. : don’t want at this stage to promise to accept any solution not agreed.

Mc.N. C. won’t have to speak until Wed. or even Thurs.

P.M. Then p’pone until we can discuss with E.B.

A.V.A. Don’t want to be committed at all, from defence angle, until we know what the recommns. are.

A.B. We asked the court to hear this case – and asked for Special Assembly too. Fair to make a reservation about enforcement. But we must accept the

authority of the court.

R.S.C. Para. 4 formula – amending last sentence so as to say that it will be for

Genl. Assembly to consider how any solution can be implemented.

P.M. But this isn’t a court.

E.Sh. Supported A.B.’s view.

P.M. Why shd we have to give this assurance in advance of others?

We retain our right finally to decide on a U.N. recommn., what advantage was there in referring to U.N. We have evaded no responsibility.

227

A.B. We are members of U.N. We shd. share with others duty to accept due decision. All must share in enforcing.

If ques. is asked. we can’t dodge it.

3. National Service Bill

C.J. Art. 10 empowers G. Assembly to do no more than make recommns.

H.M. x/. in para. 7. We shdn’t exclude this possibility.

Mc.N. Depends wthr. we are on Cttee or not.

P.M. to discuss with E.B., and settle instns. or refer again to Cabinet.

[Exit Mc.N .

P.M. Reported Def. Cttee. conclusions – as in W.S.M.’s note.

Found however, can’t determine “the emergency” for this purpose

before others. Need therefore statutory authority to authorise l.a.’s to

discontinue these payments and also to deal with superannuation.

Shdn’t be contentious.

A.V.A. Is this the right Bill for this?

A.B. Why not?

Conclusions approved.

A.B. L.P. Cttee decision re payment of balance of civil pay. 16/3 [Exit E.Sh.

P.M. This is a permanent measure.

H.M. Not fair to leave this as permissive to l.a.’s.

P.M. Won’t this open the door to all sorts of new amendments?

Approved inclusion of special clause. [Exit Serv. Ministers

4. Industrial Organisation Bill.

G.A.I. As in memo.

R.S.C. Once you start to give this special protn. to Govt. Dpts. you will always have to do so or “raise a doubt”.

P.M. Attempt to differentiate between Dpts. is wrong. Must be presumed that one part of Govt. always consults another as necessary. eg. provns. requiring one Dpt. to consult another.

G.T. Must, however, avoid duplication.

228

G.A.I. V. well, I won’t press point (a).

Must press (b) re recruitment.

R.S.C. They have 19 diff. functions – straying into field of numerous Depts. eg. undertaking research : what about D.S.I.R.

Much better control over these Councils than you have now over firms, trade assocns. etc. any of whom cd. undertake these functions. You can’t now prevent eg I.C.I. from running recruiting campaigns.

T.W. Will the control be effective? Can we be sure recruitment will be co-ordinated?

R.S.C. Only giving them the power. Strongest argument against is that this wd. give colour to idea that

Councils are concerned with wages and conditions.

G.A.I. Surprised to hear T.U.C. are against it. [Exit A.

5. Mid-Week Sport

A.B. But diff. to w’draw the power.

H.M. This cd. be covered in the Orders. They cd. include provn. requiring Council to conform to dirns issued by appointg. Dpt.

Agreed : have (b) to be covered in Orders.

G.A.I. Point (c) : as in memo.

R.S.C. F.B.I. and T.U.C. both against this. Rejected by Cab. Cttee.

This is a row between F.B.I. and Confedn. of Employers.

Many of these matters overlap with condns.

But, if T.U.C. are against, I won’t oppress the point.

Agreed : drop point (c).

G.A.I. Point (d). As in memo.

R.S.C. Minister appointing Council must approve colln. of statistics. That covers risk of duplication.

Agreed : reject point (d).

A.G. Pity these ques. cdn’t be decided before introdn. of Bill.

.

R.S.C. B/T. intending to hold mid-week sports mtg. M/T : M/Ed. have

decided to hold one.

229

Suggest it begins at 4 p.m.

A.V.A. We were trying to stop spectators not competitors.

Agreed : no objn.

Can’t get a ground at wk. ends.
