C.M. 75 (47) 9th September, 1947 1.

Parliament

H.M. H/Lds. mtg. to-day, contrary to wishes of Govt.

Have tabled 2 motions.

Discussed: objectionable &amp; usurping functions of Parlt. as a whole. Wish with P.M.’s concurrence to Salisbury saying this was constitutionally objectionable. Hall &amp; I have since seen Salisbury &amp; Samuel &amp; m’tained that view.

Will they meet again during H/C recess. If so, shd. Govt. attend?

H.

We cannot agree to mtg. of H/L. at instance of Opposn. S. said

he must then make his posn clear. He has seen Swinton &amp; Twist

Salisbury wasn’t difficult: had thought Govt. wd. welcome debate.

if we will say we aren’t prepd to make statement on economic situation, he won’t raise constitutional issue. But he will oppose notion to adjourn till H/C. meets again. Thus, I must state Govt. view on constitutional issue.

Pakenham’s reply will be confined to explaining ques. raised re Orders.

Think we must oppose motion to adjourn only to 30/9. Tho’ will have only 10 or so present. May I threaten that Govt. supporters won’t attend.

P.M. Divide. Say won’t attend unless mtg. solely for discussing Orders.

A.B. Logical consequence of this: H/L. must be subordinate to H/C. or disappear.

Diffy. of sitting days for orders etc. Time expires if either House meets &amp; rights of H/C. to comment on an order may be denied if H/L. goes on sitting.

H. H/L can’t pray at to-days sitting.

H.M. Thought each House counted its own days.

2. British Nationality Bill.

P.M. L.Q.’s should consider this point.

[Enter Att. Genl

A.B. Record my objn to Govt. spokesman attending to give any facilities to H/L when H/C is not meeting.

[Exit Hall &amp; W.W. P.M. India?

C.E. Start on basis tht. India will wish to be in same position as older Doms.

[Enter A.H. &amp; I.T.

Agreed.

291

[Enter C.K.,

[Exit Att. G.

3.

Control of Engagement Order

G.A.I. Propose to start quietly: can put screw on later if required.

R.S.C. Colton?

G.A.I. Will give choice of mills within same town.

A.B. Shall we make it clear there will be some direction of employers. Diffy. can’t direct a man to risk own capital. But can say you will cut off raw materials from man who won’t make what he shd.

R.S.C. Yes: I shall make that clear qua exports. A.B. Bldg. workers. Can evade this by becoming self-employed. Therefore

examine control of regn of new firms. Want M/W. and M/L. to

consider.

C.K. Are going into this already. Will consult M/L.

In war we had Restn of Transfer Order. That hole must be

stopped.

Doesn’t prevent employer transferring man to non-priority jobs in bldg.

G.A.I. Will look into that.

H.D. Shd. be power to remove bldg. employers from register.

C.K. Looking into that.

E.B. Yes: &amp; stop a new Wimpey! All the work between wars was done by new firms. Take care. Play into hands of old guard. Also M/W. shdn’t administer because they aren’t impartial. Wd.

prefer M/L. did it. M/W. subject to pressures from bldg. trade.

P.M. Work out &amp; announce simultaneously concomitant powers over

employers. Man Power Cttee (?) to look into this.

Para. 3 (1) agreed – subject to above.

Broad principle: compulsion shd. be confined to priority work with in

a firm or industry.

Para. 3 (2) agreed

Para. 3 (3) Direction away from home not to be applied to women,

with family responsibilities.

Para. 3 (4) &amp; (5) Agreed.

Para. 3 (6) Form of appeal to be reported to Cabinet.

292

Spivs and Drones.

E.B. Careful not to be too miserable.

H.M. Can’t we shut Pools down wholly?

R.S.C. Trying to handle on basis of war-time concentration.

Lpl. is main centre. Put some essential work there. 24.000 unempld now in Lpl.

H.M. Effort re money which is being expended on pools.

G.A.I. Money spent there is non-inflationary.

Our idea is to register them under D.T. 58 A. We can then get at it.

Not pools only: wastage of effort in printing.

A.B. Immorality of organised gambling.

Agreed: Take this power: then go on to concentration.

Clubs.

C.E. V. gt. danger of corruption in Police if you give them this discretion.

cf. Mrs Mcorrcik &amp; Serg. Goddard.

Mustn’t use Police openly. Don’t even want senior police offrs. to advise.

Register: and let M/Labour provide own machinery for enquiry etc.

Agreed: Approve 2(c) - if it means anything.

Street Trading.

C.E. Law doesn’t apply to sale from lorries.

G.A.I. But our plan wd. require legislation = M/L licensing individuals.

P.M. Penalise the barrow pusher: but anyone can open a shop.

A.V.A. Surrender to W. Womessley.

E.B. And how do you make them work when you’ve got them.

P.M. Look into street trading again. Doubt if it’s wise.

Unoccupied.

G.A.I. If you don’t tackle a) shd. we bother with d).

293

E.B. What is vacancy demand?

G.A.I. Not more than we can fill by further use of Poles etc.

E.B. M/L staff will have to be expanded by 7.000 or more to tackle these jobs.

A.B. But how can you get “national effort” across w’out an effort to rope in the butterflies?

Agreed: Man Power Cttee to review all proposals re Spivs.

Poles. There is no pledge by this Govt. re

E.B. Para. 6 Keep none who won’t work. Deport to Poland. work of their choice.

A.V.A. Leave it as recommended in para. 6 – last sentence – agreeing in

principle that Poles must work or be sent home.

Can be exaggerated. Told 5,000 recalcitrants: on examn found only 3.000 or (500??) Most are working. Trouble has be T.U.’s who won’t have them.

More concerned about idle refugees. Wdn’t keep any who aren’t working. Deport the bouches inutiles.

So decide: &amp; Dpts. to work out details.

Para. 7 of memo. Pensioners.

G.A.I. Will discuss with Ty. &amp; M/N.I.

H.D. Don’t like it.

H.M. Nor do I.

P.M. Don’t bring it up until Dpts. agree.

Employment in Managerial Capacity.

G.A.I. T.U.C. asking whtr. this exemption shd. continue. I think it shd.

E.B. Try to define it – to prevent bosses’ sons escaping.

P.M. Put onus of proof on the man &amp; have a tribunal.

Press Conference. Operations on 1/10

294

4.

Housing: Priority for Miners and Farm Workers.

T.W. Disappointed by this. See few houses in it.

A.B. Why this enquiry at all? Only reproduces views of my Dpt.

P.M. Let the Ministers concerned examine this.

(Housing Cttee?)

[Enter Woodburn, Barnes

5.

Export Programme.

R.S.C. Outlined aims of policy. Drew attention to conditions of fulfilment in para. 24.

P.M. How do you ensure tht. this output wins dollars.

R.S.C. Not dollars only now we are off convertibility: it’s market by market.

Must negotiate with each supplying country bi-laterally.

This p’mme designed to get us maximum export to dollar markets.

But must now direct also to other supplying countries.

A.V.A. Risk of further restricting exports to Empire?

R.S.C. Not necessarily because we draw much from them. They complain, of course, of world-shortage of textiles: &amp; they are getting higher %age than anyone else.

P.M. What machinery for directing exports?

R.S.C. Wilson Cttee on main policy. Overseas Negotns Cttee must be linked with that. For everyone wants e.g. semi-finished steel – a most unprofitable export.

E.B. Room for more dollar-earning by Colonies? They must have capital equipment first. Will this p’mme allow for that?

R.S.C. Yes. Might even be worth while to allow a dollar contract for e.g. rlways.

I.T. Textiles for Colonies. Only getting bare necessities. Won’t work for money.

H.M. a) Is there a market (e.g. cars) for these products?

b) Will our export prices be all right.

c) Public shd. be satisfied tht. machinery will be there to ensure they go to countries fr. wh. we can get profitable return.

295

R.S.C. On a) this is our best guess. Circs. may change. P’mme must therefore be flexible.

On c) we shall take power to control destinations – largely by agreemt. &amp; extent will depend on degree of bi-lateralism &amp; willingness of foreign countries to take the import.

A.V.A. And what about prices?

R.S.C. Order books are in fact almost full. Some items market has turned into buyers: &amp; we’ve not budgeted for increase there.

A.W. This was conceived as target. But at end/memo it becomes forecast. We haven’t accepted it as such.

Discns with industry going on. E.g. motor industry. Don’t want this figure given to public now, esp. when consultns with industry not completed.

R.S.C. Essential to give a task with figures in it. Otherwise we’re back at “let export all we can”. F.B.I. &amp; industry share this view.

We must give a concrete aim.

A.W. Aim, yes. But no promise we’ll achieve it.

R.S.C. Can keep it flexible: if our market fails, switch to another – ask one

industry to do more if another fails.

Memo. is based on assumptions a) markets &amp; b) materials will be

available.

But under bi-lateral system we must direct our production.

Not pledging ourselves to achieve these targets.

A.W. What of last sentence in para. 23.

R.S.C. True. Must be so.

E.Sh. Global target, yes. But re-adjustments w’in that total.

Markets: if industies asked to increase export p’mme must consider whr. you are going to get valuable return. Don’t export goods using coal &amp; steel in order to get wine &amp; peaches.

P.M. Decided ahead to cut imports of luxuries.

E.Sh. May have to come back to multi-lateral.

W’in global increase, no effective change in balance btwn. essential &amp; non-essential prodn. E.g. wireless etc. why not regard this as completely unessential for home market &amp; stop prodn to save materials etc.

R.S.C. There is (p.1) a complete re-adjustment. E.g. increase cars 21/2 times, but no increase in steel. 296

If we cut radar completely, you get price to a point at which you can’t

sell an export. And re-tool the factories for other prodn.

Some re-adjustment of that kind may become essential later.

Specific conditions in Para. 24. i) Not out of gas prodn because reduces supply of coke &amp; cuts

into steel.

H.M. (i) Coal. Which sectors go short?

R.S.C. Presumably prodn for home market. Or domestic coal consumption.

E.Sh. This involves exceedg. budget figure for industry. To do 241/2 m. w’in existg. coal prodn: we shd. have to cut in other consumptn.

domestic consumption is high.

ii) Domestic consumption. V. diff. to cut that.

R.S.C. Then we must either forego exports &amp; draw on gold reserves or cut domestic or try to give more industrial coal to export industies. May get longer hours in mining.

P.M. B/T. must be able to announce plans to industry. He wants a definite

allocation.

E.Sh. Don’t want to have to say now I shall cut domestic. Don’t want to

jeopardise domestic stocks now.

R.S.C. Don’t want you to do that now. Only ask tht., if necessary, we shall readjust

to get this volume for industry when it’s needed.

E.Sh. Ready to re-adjust allocations if

A.B. Must we not go fwd. on assumptions &amp; re-adjust acc. to performance.

E.Sh. But don’t want another fuel crisis, esp. if winter is severe.

A.B. But run-down of stocks doesn’t become v. serious until end/winter.

it is essential.

iii) Coke &amp; coking coal. Diffy. (new) is scrap. Are M/S doing

all they can to get scrap here &amp; abroad (Germany).

A.W. Doing all we can in U.K.

Can’t give figure, however.

ii) agreed

Germany: booty free: rest in dollars. Our people think G. industry can feed on their ruins.

R.S.C. No drive to recover scrap in U.K.

297

A.W. More can be done.

A.B. L.a.’s won’t co-operate so long as dumps are to be seen un-collected.

E.g. ships in estuaries.

[A.W. Dump nr. Forth Bridge.]

A.W. Ships are being cut as fast as steel-cutting capacity can be obtd.

J.W. Scrap at paper mills.

Agreed; M/S to submit report to P.M. on existing organisation

Also on measures requd to get more from Germany.

iv) Steel Allocations.

R.S.C. 6-12 mos. time factor for manufacture. This period allocn reflects

exports fr. end ’48.

B. Existg. priorities settled after much thought. Hope they won’t be

modified w’out examn.

T.W. Increase of 100% in agric. machinery. Can’t be done at expense of

home market. Factory capacity is there for both. But materials

shd. go first to home needs.

P.M. Allocations must be reviewed.

R.S.C. Some priority p’mmes may have to be cut into.

i) Rlway wagons may have to suffer, R.S.C. says. But this is

bottle-neck in coal &amp; steel.

Can H.D. and Marquand do any arbitrating required after the reallocation

has bn. made?

Is export requirement to come first &amp; everyone else must confirm?

&amp; possibility of getting more drive into it.

E.B. Is it wise to leave this to their industry

A.W. Was thought during war that best form of organn was thro’ trade.

E.Sh. Coal/oil conversion will have to be cut into anyway.

P.M. Materials Cttee must have some discretion as regards priority p’mmes.

H.M. Re-allocn will be diff.

ii) Generating stations. Wd. also affect production.

P.M. Yes.

A.B. Is this to be done before investment p’mme has bn revised.

298

P.M. Re-allocation to facilitate exports &amp; dollar-saving, even tho’ some home p’mmes may have to suffer.

P.M. M/H. can have his appeal at a proper time.

H.M. Enquiry in hand.

P.M. Must be an enquiry.

R.S.C. Couldn’t we have report in 14 days.

H.M. Joint examns with F.B.I.

vi)

A.B. Why not put it: everything above an export quota will go to home

market? Work it out positively.

R.S.C. Yes: all I want now is authy to reduce to this if necessary.

R.S.C. This &amp; dollar-saving must be a first charge.

E.B. No escape fr. concln that exports etc. get what steel they need and other p’mmes divide what is left.

v) Authorities for use of Steel.

E.B. Use powers.

Agreed: but report in 14 days.

Textiles = Man Power

G.A.I. Not above other industies.

R.S.C. In Lancs. &amp; Yorks. must have the preference – to reach the targets.

E.B. Accept the principle but transfer to M/L. paper.

vii) Clothing Ration

I. Shd. you give the warning publicly?

R.S.C. Yes: want to put industry on its mettle.

E.B. Ask for 100% increase: then so much for export and not for home trade.

Approved, subject to its being re-cast positively.

viii) Staggering Hours.

R.S.C. Because of women workers.

E.Sh. Will provoke similar claims from other industries.

Wd. also add 6% to load. Can’t get target unless all conform.

Better to try bringing plant into opn at diff. hours &amp; other expedients. 299

Agreed: R.S.C. to have some latitude to get variations thro’

ix) Commercial Vehicles.

Home market have bn. having 60% of output.

B. Can’t we look at this again.

P.M. No. Allocate better what you do get. And increase output.

A.W. Give us materials &amp; we can increase output.

A.B. Glazed tiles are being dispensed with in housing here so as to export to

Argentine. But may I be assured they won’t be used for private

p’mme?

R.S.C. Yes.

A.W. Risk of closing down w’out makg. good alternative use. E.g. cutlery.

Care of tourist purchase.

xi) Already approved.

xii) Postponing Home Programmes.

H.D. At L.P. Cttee M/Ag. agreed to gradualism.

A.W. Held up anyhow for motors.

G.A.I. Prefer tht. R.S.C. shd. instruct his repves on Bd. to press for it.

Don’t have over-riding rule. Leave it to local arrangemt.

Reg. Bds.

B. Does this include buses?

R.S.C. Yes.

B. Our services are brkg. down.

R.S.C. Must try to meet that by increased output.

x) Diversion from Home Market.

A.B. i.e. no tuberculosis in Argentine at cost of tuberculosis at home.

P.M. I will consider the particular case of milk.

Otherwise approve in principle.

xiii) Approved.

300

xiv) Regional Organisation.

A.W. Doubtful about this.

G.A.I. So are we. They mustn’t touch supply of labour.

Agreed.

xvi) Publicity.

C.K. So many Reg. Cttees. D.I. Panel cd. do it.

R.S.C. Nothing to do with that.

P.M. Same people – different task.

R.S.C. M/L. shd. be included. Agreed with that amendment.

xv) Packing Materials.

E.B. Hope R.S.C. will stress point tht. no suffering need be endured if industry will give 10% increased output all round.

R.S.C. Yes.

B’cast same evening.

Agreed. [Exit A.W., C.K.

1. (resumed) Parliament.

We shd. legislate at once to put this right.

A.B. That makes it a Govt. Statement.

P.M. Read opinion by A.H. General on ques. of time running.

Then A.B.’s point was a good one.

It shd. be put in argument.

C.E. To-day’s mtg. constitutes a precedent, in itself.

If H/L. establish w’out protest a right to meet when H/C. isn’t they will cut down rights of H/C.

A.B. Then Pakenham shdn’t speak at all.

H.M. What did Jowitt say? Deprecated H/L. mtg. but said he cdn’t stop them &amp; wd. be told what Orders had bn. made. He does not want debate on merits.

P.M. Why shdn’t Hall include that in his speech?

301

H.D. He can say “nothing to add to Ldn. Gazette &amp; I don’t propose to make any statement on behalf of the Govt. Their Lordships will have seen Orders in Ldn. Gazette.” 6.

Hall re-entered &amp; was informed.

Coal: Extension of Working Hours.

E.B. This memo. wd. let me down completely – on what I said to N.U.M.

Later, Cab. instructed me to ask them to re-consider extra 1/2 hr.

E.Sh. Who started all this? H.M. &amp; E.B. proposed another 1/2 hr. I always knew that was hopeless.

But it led to alternative of Sat. working.

Suggd since we shd. try to get parties together. The N.U.M. havg. rejected H.M.’s appeal for extra 1/2 hr. In Executive only I vote majority v. it.: but at mtg. much larger majority. And N.U.M. won’t look at extra 1/2 hr.

E.B. had said somethg. about time &amp; a half.

N.C.B. y’day gave way a bit. N.U.M. will consider each miner to

work alternate Sats.: &amp; assist in getting organised shift.

But we must stand firm on the 6 for 5. Can’t concede that.

E.Sh. Grimethorpe: now a dispute betwn. those men &amp; branch of Unions.

No justificn for attacks on N.C.B. Fact is: 3 men appointed (incldg. 1

official) to examine stint.

T.W. Argument of local Cttee.

b) didn’t examine the face at all. Lots of them want to go back,

but afraid of one another.

7. Economic Situation: Representations by F.B.I.

My position. I didn’t initiate either of these proposals.

You can’t get extra 1/2 hr.

You must therefore take this method of Sat. working or abandon whole thing.

H.M. E.Sh. believes in 5 days. Better have that.

N.U.M. want no intervention. No arbitration.

a) assessment wrong.

E.B. Shd. have secret ballot vote.

E.Sh Nat. Ex. going up en masse.

On extra hours: no further offers.

Agreed. L.P. to inform F.B.I. by letter.

302

8. Meetings of International Fund and Bank.

On annual rpts anyone can suggest Bank &amp; Fund shd. do more for

econ. crisis. Will encourage that idea. But p’ess twds. practical

action must be made in private talks.

Saw Synder last night – v. friendly – will do all he can. Will pursue

these matters with him. And will report later.

H.D. Little will happen at formal public mtgs.

Don’t want these mtgs. to cross wires with Paris.

E.B. Approached me y’day (U.S. Ambassador). Paris report nearly ready. Facts startling – worse than Marshall thought.

Want me to ask Paris to screen figures etc. de novo.

Said no. You’ve asked for this.

[Absent, on account annual leave, for C.M. 76 and 77th Meetings.]
