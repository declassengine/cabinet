H.M. Ch. Whip even now thinks this too heavy.

Other points as in brief.

Necessary to run Parlt. heavily in 1st two Sessions of Parlt. under

Labour Govt.

But strain was v. great. And diff. to defend some of our present

haste over Rpt. Stage of T.C.P. &amp; Transport Bill. Must have a

lighter p’mme for 3rd Session. Apply the rest: are these Bills

Can do it “if time permits”. If it doesn’t, can get political credit
