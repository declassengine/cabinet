C.M. 73 (47) 20th August, 1947 1.

Balance of Payments. Letters O.K.

Hold to decision re

Telegrams read.

H.D. W.E’s proposal won’t do. Apart fr. losing the credit for 2 months, it puts us under U.S. surveillance for 2 mos. - &amp; we shall have to misbehave.

But can’t have secret agreement. dead-line. Exchange letters. Add: offer not to

Beginning Aug. 1000 m. left. Drew 150m. 1/8 and 150 on 11/8: notified

300 more for 25th Aug. Want to secure those. Don’t therefore

defy U.S. as in 3rd alternative.

R.S.C. Ministers must go out to W’ton.

x/ make drawings beyond those notified pendg. further consultn with U.S. Govt.

Intend drawg. 150 early Sept. – 1st Sept.

E.E.B. We said we wd. normally be giving notice now of this for 1/9. But gave W’ton discretion to decide when we gave notice of this because of state of discn.

H.D. The secret agreemt. gives us drawings notified.

Para. 5 of tel. indicates U.S. might be disposed to accept my alternatives.

R.S.C. But they didn’t depart from para 4.

H.D. They have suggd new para because we said we cdn’t accept secret agreement.

Hang on to lr. &amp; words of 8 (ii) (b). What we want is consutln enabling U.S. G. to “agree otherwise.”

E.E.B. Read draft of additional para.

R.S.C. Add discussions under Art. 8 (ii) (b). That doesn’t import Congress, as does consultn under Art. 12. Must avoid latter.

H.M. H.D.’s suggn seems to fit with U.S. attitude. B. criticism: we have put ourselves at U.S. mercy.

Only alternatives: stand on lr. &amp; take consequences. Wdn’t get the dollars. And B. public wd. be annoyed with U.S.

H.D. We cd. say U.S. wdn’t allow more drawings w’out further consultn.

E.Sh. What is next ship? That must colour our action. Can’t ignore that.

After end of Aug. we shall be out of dollars save 550m. at best.

We are dependent on U.S. Mustn’t antagonise them: or take precipitate action save essential.

We shall have to make v. drastic cuts in imports etc. Best course therefore to try for best agreemt. with U.S. for future. We

are supplicant.

That’s why I believe we must send Ministers. Must get a basis for discussion.

H.D. Will be gt. need to decide on consequential action.

Disposed to agree with E.Sh. Supplementary statement re drawings cd. be in separate letter.

H.M. Ministerial discns wd. be in interval up to 1/9.

E.Sh. Want sense of urgency here – shock to B. public. Good on that a/c that

Ministers shd. go.

Agreed: Deadline action to proceed on 20/6 at 9. p.m.

Try to get 1/9 drawing covered.

R.S.C. Much better in one document.

Reply to U.S. as at x/.
