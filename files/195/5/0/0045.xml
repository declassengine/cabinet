C.M. 45(47). 8th May, 1947.

1. Financial Relations with Local Authorities. [Enter Barnes.

Block grant due for revision pre-war.

formula achieves our object of rate equalisation for citizens in

valuations. But not so serious as might be supposed. And will

Authorities which will lose, or not gain, are small in number &amp; rich

Want some elbow room for negotiation here – to ease it by bringing

this to-day.

H.D. Taken much trouble over this. Considered various alternatives.

and exchequer doesn’t gain on balance. Gives good results in

all over country: and equalisations w’in London between

had to be scraped. Many counties will also gain e.g. Norfolk

A.B. From Apl. ’48 – hospitals, other health services, roads &amp; poor law

will be transferred to central Govt. &amp; relief to l.a.’s from this

transfer exceeds total of Block Grant. But w’in total, relief

will fall unevenly - &amp; the poorer areas will gain less from

loss of health obligns tho’ more from transfer of poor law.

C/E. has stated tht. grant must be revised so as to give more help to

poorer l.a.’s.

This is basis of new scheme. Amount not known. Method – as

in para. 5. Effect – as in para. 11. (quoting the examples). The

various parts of country. No change in existg. formula for

distribution w’in (sub-districts) counties. This scheme deals

only with county &amp; county boro’s.

Formula wd. operate much more fairly if there had bn. central

valuation. There will still be inequalities because different

be removed when we amend Rating &amp; Valuation Acts.

in funds. Mainly those with many industrial properties, which

lost on de-rating.

Huddersfield, e.g. wd. go from 12/= to 12/9.

Bradford from 17/9 – 28/2. Bury also high.

it in over 5 years, where it means increased. No decision on

This is best.

Simple. Gives broadly desired results. See para. 7. New grant

is £26 m. less than the old: but transferred services cost £72.5 m:

relation to rate structure of country as a whole. Reduces average

Boroughs. Helps poor development areas, where services have

16/11 to 10/=. Doesn’t benefit only industrial areas.

Novelty = l.a.’s above a certain level of wealth will get no block grant.

2/6 rate. This too has equalising effect.

minor adjustments only.

Para. 6. Education grant. Formula now agreed. 60% of l.a.

expenditure + capitation fee p.a. of 120/= per pupil – product of

Not much more play, in negotiation. Meet some hard cases – but

250

J.W. Edinb. gets no benefits. Awkward, but not fatal. [Exit Barnes.

Developmt. areas &amp; crofting cos. benefit greatly. [Enter W.W.

Sutherland by 16/9!

H.D. Will result in disclosing under/ or over/ valuation &amp; force more

reasonable attitude.

2. Parliament.

A.B. Also adjusts automatically every year - &amp; takes a/c of changes as we

go along.

G.T. Can consult l.e.a.’s simultaneously with l.a.’s. That is satisfactory.

E.B. Later give estimate of economy in staff.

General approval: authority to negotiate.

[Enter A.V.A.

H.M. H/C. sitting all night. Suggd going on to finish Cttee Stage. But it is

Now propose F.A. Debate, Thurs. &amp; Frid.

F. Affairs Debate. Thurs. (Supply Day) &amp; Frid.

Stats of Trade Bill – provisionally in week after next.

E.B. Can’t spare Pakenham at present for H/Lds. debates. Diffy. in

My agreemt. assumed 2nd Rdg. of N.S. Bill before Whitsun. Shan’t

Short of spokesmen in H/Lds. Transport &amp; T.C.P. Bills are v. heavy.

1st rate assistant &amp; selected Pakenham. Want him 20/21 May:

our back-benchers who have done 50% of talking. Agreed

therefore to wind up ll.45 a.m. &amp; complete Cttee Stage Friday.

Rpt. &amp; 3rd Reading. Intended Thurs. next; but doubt if amendments

can be tabled in time. Now think 20 or 21/5.

Hence: T. &amp; C.P. Bill: Rpt. Stage: Mon. Tues. Wed.

(Adjournment).

Germany.

A. T.C.P. Bill will be finished? W.W. Thurs. 22nd May.

now get it.

J. will take T.C.P. Bill. I was takg. Transport; but must have

June for Cttee.

H.M. Cttee Stage rather than 2nd Readg.

A. Yes. 4 days. 9-12 June.

E.B. Will consider that.
