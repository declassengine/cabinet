C.M. 4(47) 8th January 1947

1. India.

P.M. Introduced revised draft.

[Enter Listowel]

P.S. W. sees this in opposite order – puts first his intention of phased w’drawal.

If that is suppressed, his main object in asking for statement disappears.

Left only with idea of stringing 2 Parties together.

P.M. Latter was always in my view main ground for statement

Also running down of adminn. warning tht. all obligns. of 1935 Act cdn’t be carried out.

Explained differences of view between Viceroy and H.M.G. – not a military evacuation : still aiming at peaceful transfer and w’drawal. This wd. discourage Congress from playing politics in interval. Because you transfer power you don’t scuttle hastily from India. Transfer of power is one thing : physical w’drawal is another. Re-disposition of forces and adminn. can be made w’out w’drawing Province by Province.

E.B. Believe W. wants to run. Don’t think there need be disorder. W. must accept this and carry it out with good heart.

Army. Assume 2 Parties come together in C.A. what consultns. contemplated betwn. C. in C. and future controller of I.A. Essential to F.O. that I.A. shd. stand as organised force. We can’t afford chaos from any cause.

R.S.C. Believe they wd. ask Auchinleck to stay on.

A.V.A. Indian Def. Minister has asked tht. A. shd. stay on for at least 2 years.

And wants other key posns. in I.A. to be held by existg. B. officers.

P.M. Fear of W. and I.C.S. tht. I.A. may break up. No decision yet on how the defence of India wd. be retained. No discussions. But if W’s policy adopted that and other ques. wd. never be discussed with an Indian Govt.

A.B. This document meets Cab’s 1st objective – shows we go out as act of policy.

2nd objective : discuss with Indians processes of transfer. This is likely to result in series of continuing engagements at request of India.

A. Later documents of I. and B. Cttee seek to go behind Cab’s general line – which rejected W.’s plan of phased w’drawal.

23

We were asked to make this statement if Muslims decided not to come in to C.A. Needn’t therefore make it now.

P.M. I still believe it shdn’t be made (in this form) unless a break-down.

P.L. Statement in Times today – Jinnah will convene League to consider wthr. they will come in, because of Congress attitude.

P.M. Believe W. shd. be asked to return.

R.S.C. Agreed.

E.B. What of attitude of I.C.S. generally? They seem depressed. Can we not put heart into them?

R.S.C. Only W. cd. do that.

A. Commn. with Dom. P.M.’s . Have drafted a message with I.0. Arranged also to discuss with High Commrs. on Thurs. Still think some informn. shd. go to Doms.

P.M. Give them some background. A. Will consult P.M.

E.B. Delete words in [ ] in para. 14. }

}Agreed

H.M. Mutual advantage vice. B. interest in para 14}

Other verbal points to be sent to P.M.

[Exit L : Enter H.]

2. Arab States in Persian Gulf : Administration.

P.L. Must be a change here whatever happens in India.

We don’t want it.

F.O. shd. in the end, but aren’t ready now. C.O. are ready but wd. give wrong idea.

Propose therefore that we shd. carry on until F.O. can take on.

E.B. Agree.

This was a dodge for getting G/India to pay for B. responsibility!

Will expedite plans to take over.

H.D. This is sensible plan.

Wd. have to be carried on I.0. Vote. Try to delay to avoid Supplementary.

Reserve Ty. right to examine Estimate in detail.

A.V.A. Going on satisfactorily on the ground.

C.J. Agree wiser for F.O. to do this.

24

[Exit H. Enter Barnes.

3. Turkish Wheat.

P.L. Summarised memo.

It is wheat tht. India wants. They assumed they wd. get all of this. Has bn. so stated by Reuter. If we take it all for U.K. we shall be charged with breach of faith.

J.S. Can’t agree there was any pledge. Expectn. they wd. get substantial part of our buy. If we take whole of this, they will have had over half of our total purchases.

India’s cereal needs – shd. she not cope herself to greater extent. This year crops good : and on paper in 1st half year she shd. be self-sufficient overall.

Diffies. betwn. Provinces are for them to handle. Total: better off than many countries. Can’t have her on our backs when no crop failure. Can’t give her priority over U.K. and Colonial needs. We do much for Colonies : can’t carry India too.

P.L. Wheat harvest not till Apl/May. This is period of need. Plenty of rice doesn’t help wheat-eating areas.

P.M. What is meaning of ½ total purchases fr. Turkey.

All these complaints and understandings are subsequent to first purchases.

R.S.C. Letter from M/F. to India Office was a pledge to give “substantial part” of later purchases. What is difference between that and a public pledge.

J.S. U.K. wheat diff. Stocks will be 100.000 wheat : 50.000 flour down than point which caused us to ration. Can we give it all to India?

Posn. improving because Monday made big buy in Argentine.

We can therefore split this ½ and ½ with India. But we must have 1st cut at it because our needs will be v. great until we receive some from Argentine in Feb/Mar.

P.L. It is Jan/Feb. that India wants it.

P.M. Wash out arguments re pledges. Discuss this on relative merits of 2 countries.

Is India well enough off? Plenty of rice. Decision shd. turn on stock/shipments position of the 2 countries.

J.S. Much more than 1 week’s supply - stocks are there, but not in Govt. hands.

A.B. This narrows down to ques. who shall get first shipment in Feb.

H.M. Does India do all it shd. in self help?

25

P.L. Rationed 135 m. people.

E.B. Arrange 2 simultaneous ships – one for India and another for U.K.

B. No shipping diffy.

Can’t be sure Australian 17.000 t. will reach India before early March.

H.M. Can we give some Turkish in return for some U.S. wheat to U.K. via India.

J.S. Cd. consider this.

H.D. Let India have Turkish wh. costs double. Let us have some Australian in lieu, which is cheaper.

Agreed (1) 50 : 50 and consider movement and financial reasons.

(2) Consider disengaging some Australian wheat.

Consider diversions to reduce price of U.K. supplies.

(3) If no diversion, must ship 2 ways simultaneously.

At least one ship to go to India in Feb.
