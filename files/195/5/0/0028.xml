C.M. 28(47) 13th March 1947

1. Compensation on Compulsory Acquisition.

L.S. Seen H.D. : reached agreement.

Owner occupier was outstanding ques. Inflationary element : prices

soaring still : dangerous for Govt. to commit themselves to paying

those prices.

Seen prof. assocn. they recognise this and are ready to accept less than market value.

Agreed with H.D. we shd. take diff. betwn. m. value and value w’out vacant possessn. : divide diffes. by two and say one half.

T.W. This is improvement on T.C.P. proposal. Owner who has to buy another farm.

R.S.C. Impossible to work. Incidence of tenure has nothg. to do with it.

A. Agreed with R.S.C. Complexity of valuations.

F.J.B. Shdn’t be too diff. to work. Valuer cd. manage it. What basis of assessment?

R.S.C. Two inflationary elements a) general, in value of money b) shortage of accomn.

M/H. Agree with H.D. Fair thing for owner occupier was market value.

R.S.C. Better to take a percentage over 1939 value to reflect change in value of money.

L.S. Can’t go on valuing on ’39 much longer – want to get related to present day.

H.D. W.D. Commn. have passed this. Want to get value payments cleared up. Don’t want further delay. Can’t ignore recommn. of W.D. Commn.

R.S.C. Reasonable to apply W.D. scale to all acquisitions. But not to introduce new factor for vacant possession. What of scale of decreasing value acc. to liberty to occupy in 2, 3 or 4 yrs.

L.S. There is a distinctn. : it is immed. possn. cases that are inflated.

F.J.B. Basis for v. payment = 1939 value of premises with vacant possessn. This has meant disputes over 50% cases. How do they estimate ’39 value now?

V. difficult. H.D. and L.S. now want to get in relation to current m. value less v. possn. para. 5. Then refer other ques. to smaller body. 153

Agree : (Accept para. 5.

( C. and B. Cttee to settle the other point.

( L.S. can promise amendments on Report.

[Exit L.S. and Nathan.

2. German Prisoners of War. Mc.N. Diffies. a) U.S. pressure b) R. use of p.o.w. Believe they have 3½ m.

and have only released 120.000. E.B. was ready to offer some

concession if we cd. get more on b).

E.B. asks authy. to put in our p’mme in return for R. p’mme.

Why not trade the p.o.w.’s for d.p.’s.

R.S.C. Cdn’t some p.o.w.’s be absorbed as civilians? [Enter C.O.S.

G.A.I. P.Q’s on this point. We’ve bn. concentratg. on Poles; and they aren’t

anxious to work on farms.

T.W. Diffies of agriculture. Remember our food commitments. Lost 12.000 betwn. Jan and December.

G.A.I. Endorsed. Even if all Poles were empld. wdn’t have enough to replace p.o.w.’s D.P.’s even if brought here wdn’t be trained.

J.W. Agreed. Agric. also behind because of weather.

R.S.C. Other emplts? Roads, rlways etc.

F.J.B. M/E. situatn. will be disastrous. 87.000 p.o.w. there and our move to Canal Zone wd. collapse if phased rate of w’drawal of p.o.w. were upset as proposed by E.B.

C. Commn. can’t take more than 19.000 a month.

P.M. E.B. is misled re cost: their work wd. have to be done by others.

Dates given to M. must be related to our economic posn.

Gave figure of emplt. of p.o.w.’s in U.K.

Labour in M/E. 600.000 d.p.’s on our hands. What of those in Italy and Austria? Move them to M/E.

C. Commn. askg. for more d.p.’s for emply. in B. Zone.

Unreal to suppose these p.o.w.’s will still be here in Sept.

&amp; Genl. Blomfield

Will hedge if possibility of allowg. Germans to remain as civilians.

C.I.G.S. P.o.w. in M/E. will all be out by mid/48., on phased [Exit T.W.

p’mme. At least 40.000 will be needed till July ’48. If

not, we shall have to move mil. labour from Pal.

Cdn’t promise to accelerate w’out consult. M/E.

Cd. prs. shift 10.000 Chetniks in return – not others. 154

R.S.C. Wdn’t appeal to Moscow! No use for this E.B. bargain.

R.S.C. Why not convert to civilian force?

F.J.B. That is proposed : will be done later on.

P.M. Why not dispense these : bring in Chetniks etc. instead.

Army cd.

N.B. Wd. get an irritant out of Italy – some advantage.

Shall be into Canal Zone by end/March. Shan’t want 90.000 then.

P.M. Cd. ques. figures for E.B.

Date?

C.I.G.S. For M/E. firm p’mme.

P.M. From U.K?

F.J.B. 15.500 p. month.

Mc.N. Cd. press Fr. and Belgium to accelerate release of our prs.

P.M. Why shd. weight be put on us alone. Fr. and B. shd. contribute.

H.D. R. figure will be much larger.

P.M. About G. p.o.w.’s on civilian basis, subject to security screening. Agreed : push this forward. Stop policy of waiting for Poles to be settled first.

Second telegram.

Are they in mil. formns.

V.C.N.S. Minesweeping : was hoped to finish in summer ‘47 and delayed by weather : rec. to keep theme as uniformed and disciplined body.

Dienagruppen : 3.000; 45% technicians. Expect to dispense in four months. Refit : m’tenance of minesweepers.

N.B. Para. 4. of telegram. Cd. we bring young Germans from M/E. and replace by Chetniks etc.

R.S.C. By 31.12.47 : this is happening already isn’t it?

C.I.G.S. Minesweeping must be disciplined. be civilians by end/47.

P.M. V. well : do it.

Mc.N. Yugoslavs in Mil. Watchmen’s Corps. Cd. we have end/47 as target for

complete civilianisation?

155

C.I.G.S. Yes.

V.C.N.S. Note minesweeping is in Fr. Dutch etc. waters.

[Exit Serv. Ministers. C.O.S. &amp; McN

3. Transport Bill. C. Licences.

General view : abandon these provisions altogether.

H.D. Majority in favour of dropping this on pol. grds. Don’t resist tho’ on merits wd. prefer alternative draft – will undermine

finance of T. Commn.

Agreed : Drop these provns.

B. Will meet Unions before Clause is reached.

[Exit M/W. M/H. Barnes.

4. Parliament.

W.W. Business for the week.

5. Parliamentary Procedure.

A.G. Explained proposals in memo.

Private Members’ Time – will be pressure for it next Session. Will

have something to say when Leg. P’mme comes up next week.

P.M. Much in this.

P.M. Don’t go v. Select Cttee on point wh. House will be jealous about.

H.D. Cd. Ch. Whip express Cab’s regret this can’t be done : press him for

further assurance of his co-opn.

P.M. Don’t press this. Agreed

W.W. Closure. Speaker is strongly opposed, for reasons given in note.

He is prepd., in view of last year’s experience to come in when I send for him because I want to move closure.

R.S.C. Wd. be better fight. Inexpedient to press it after Guillotine troubles.

: abandon this proposal re closure.

Approved, subject to this modification.

156

6. Mid-Week Sporting Events.

C.E. Good response from the assocns. consulted.

Football will co-operate.

Speedways. Biggest mtgs. are on dog tracks. Can’t therefore do it on

Sats.

All asked us [about next year].

S. Afr. Rugby tour scheduled for autumn ’47. N. Unions asking N.Z. for ’47.

Almost all these will be mid-week matches. Promised to consult them again on this.

Greyhounds. Limited by statutory days. Lanarkshire, in default of agreement btwn. promoters, fixed the days : didn’t include a Saturday.

Need therefore to enable them to race on Sat.

They also want 2 mtgs. on a Sat. Said we wd. consider legn. enabling all tracks to have a mtg. on Sat. We also felt they shd. be allowed 2 mtgs. on a Sat.

Ice hockey. V. small crowds. Only 7 tracks. Not worth bothering about.

Horse racing. National to be run on Sat.

Later arranged Chester and Manchr. Cup mtgs. to be on Sat.

We’ll discuss later other classics. Expect most can be moved to Sat.

Rosebery pointed out 10 days racing 14.000 average at Nottingham. 4 day Test will draw much larger attendance.

F.A. also asked about cricket. M.C.C. has enquired – esp. S. African tour.

Large measure of co-opn.

Practical ques. now = legn. re dogs.

J. Is it necessary to have 2 mtgs. on Sats?

G.T. This isn’t a sport. But ready to allow 2 on a Sat.

J. There will be political repercussions.

A.V.A. Will be newsp. camp. on this soon.

Must be 1m. early closers who will lose all sporting relaxns. Have they bn. consulted?

What about co-cricket?

R.S.C. No doubt that mid-week matches do cause absenteeism.

This is not a temporary measure.

P.M. What about consult. T.U.C.

G.A.I. J.A.L. mtg. this p.m.

C.E. Diff. to go back on what we have done.

157

A. Limit it all to Saturdays.

W.W. Early closers can go to 2nd mtg. on Saturday.

G.A.I. Stress fact tht. associations were asked to do this. C.E. I didn’t mention (tho’ authy to do so) our readiness to legislate in

default of agreement.

P.M. Statement. Thurs p.m. : generous recognition of attitude of assocns.

promise legn. on greyhound racing.

Cricket.

H.D. Go easy on this. Allow 1st class county cricket. No interference with Test Matches as arranged.

A.V.A. Adjustment.
