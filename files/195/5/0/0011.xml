C.M. 11(47) 22nd January 1947

1. Parliament.

[Enter W.W.

Business for next week.

C.E. Clear tht. Opposn. is going to resist takg. Cttee Stage of F. Resoln. on

same day.

Shall have to suspend 10 p.m. to take F.R.

[Exit W.W.

2. Palestine.

E.B. Considered in light of discns.

Not v. Partition on merits. Can’t see this Govt. enforcing solution v .

Opposn. Must go to U.N. anyway.

Envisage 1st class diffy. whichever way it goes.

Tell Arabs can’t find this plan acceptable.

Discuss P.A. with both sides.

On Partn. can’t make viable State for Arabs - unless we finance. Might explore fusion with other Arab States : but can’t agree on that before U.N. because illegal.

Will U.K. public support policy wh. involves force v. Arabs, in light of recent events

Enforcemt. wd. create “situation” and we wd. be brought to Security Council.

H.D. How long do we talk?

Will they ever agree? Can’t go on talking.

E.B. Arabs strong posn. because they came to Confce. and Jews refused. And we adjourned. They have bn. ready to decide. And we postponed from Dec. to Jan.

Cab. not ready to accept Arab Plan, I assume tho’ nearest solution is B. Decln.

At U.N. McMahon corres. will be pleaded : we can’t persuade U.N. we didn’t in that promise it to Arabs – in conflict with our promise.

E.Sh. Assumed fr. C.O. pp. tht. C.J. and H.C. favour Partition. Not prepd. to say it wd. be appd. by U.N. however.

Oil. Two vital ports : Haifa and Gaza. First wd. be Jewish (friendly) : we shd. be protected because ques. I.P.C. pipeline. New line wd. best come out at Gaza : presume we cd. get agreement with Arabs. Oil experts say Partition wd. be favourable to us.

Long-term. Better on whole not to alienate Jews. Even on military States doubt if we cd. rely on continuing Arab friendship. eg India, Egypt.

71

If we have to depend on Palestine. Arabs might too, if accompanied by financial guarantees – which in the end might pay us.

Desirable we shd. court favour and support of U.S.

U.K. public opinion : short memories : and Arabs not guiltless. Wd. accept any final solution.

E. B. Opinion wd. accept any settlement wd. they take firing on Arabs?

Gaza is claimed by Jews.

C.J. My memo. prepd. a personal view as against E.B.’s earlier statement.

Don’t ask Cab. to settle now policy if Confce. fails. Must first try to bring 2 sides nearer together. Then Cab. can take final decision.

Inevitable to go to U.N. Even settlement wd. have to go to T. Council. If no settlement, we go to U.N. and Cab. can settle the line we take.

My memo. needn’t be discussed now, on that basis.

But last para. is relevant.

Not in full agreement with E.B. on lines of a solution. Alternative to Partition? Will result in continuance of illegal immigrn. terrorism and conflict. Can we tolerate adminn. of P. by Mufti? Are we ready to absorb into Transjordan. No peace in M/E. w’out Partn.

Objn. to Partn.: a) can’t achieve viable Arab State. Believe neither A. not J. viable State wd. be easy. But ques. wthr. A. State viabl. wd. depend on type of Partn. Cd. be a scheme giving fertile areas, port and industrial possibies. to A. of econ. self sufficiency but near it.

Ques. wd. also be affected by absorption in Transjordan and Syria.

This therefore depends on discns. in Conference and how it goes.

b) Enmity of Arab world. Have tried to appreciate risk. Don’t despair – Reasons. i) Ec. interests of Arabs are with Britain. Don’t want to be flung into R.’s arms – strategic or economic. They owe much to us already. ii) unity of Arab world isn’t real : divisions betwn. them. Transj. wdn’t object to Partn. Unlikely they would v. it. Not certain Saudi Arabia is v. Partn. Saudi might acquiesce in it.

Agree to E.B.’s plan of discussing with a free hand and try to bring them twds. Partition.

[Exit R.S.C.

Make it clear to Arabs tht. their plan won’t bring peace and must be modified.

Make it clear to Jews tht. peace can’t be secured by their present approach.

Myself wdn’t go to U.N. with a definite proposal, if no agreement reached.

Willing to put any scheme in argument. But don’t want Cab to say that, if that fails. I must put that solution to U.N.

N.B. Doubt wthr A. wd. unite in opposn. to any scheme wh. wd. seem likely to secure support in U.N.

Don’t tie hands of negotiators.

72

Possible to go to U.N. w’out a specific plan.

Cd. get special Assembly if we asked for it. Better chance in Sept. Cd. then put it to T. Council first. M’while askg. for truce and prs. independent observers from U.N. to see who started it.

P.M. Can’t carry on adminn. until Sept.

Don’t decide now on def. policy to be imposed failing settlement.

E.B. Want to make it clear tht. if it goes to U.N. I’m not bound to any solution it goes to it ‘de novo’.

A.B. We can’t get a base if the settlement comes to U.N. w’out recommn. from us. N.B. dissented.

More important to us hold the oil than the base. Dollar income.

If Arab world turns sour, our posn. in world will be v. difficult.

P.M. And don’t rely on continuing friendship of Jews in Pal. Mainly European, and may well turn to R.

E.B. These U.S. Jews are hostile and disloyal.

E.Sh. In 2 wars Jews were on our side. Cd. you rely as much on Arabs?

3. Economic Survey.

P.M. decided we must publish W. Paper. Will come to Cabinet.
