C.M. 40(47) 28th April 1947

1. Coal : Allocations to Building Materials Industries. P.M. If you press for selectivity, you must apply it in housing too – give no

more for miners &amp; farm workers.

A.B. Can’t, because houses in constn. aren’t mobile.

A.B. Housing Cttee Friday : informed later by M/W. alarmed at B/T. intentn. to cut fuel of bldg. materials industries to 86% of last summer’s consumptn..

This is to be announced in H/C. this p.m.

Last year expanded this production : 86% will be related to pre-expansion figure. Disastrous effects on housing p’mme this year.

H.G. said by mid’48 we shall have up to 50.000 houses for miners. Why did he announce this anyway. And nonsense with this final cut.

R.S.C. Fuel Cttee decided tht. this summer’s allocation of coal to industry shd. be based on last summer’s – allowing them to find winter stocks out of that supply. Stock allowance much less than 14% is in fact 7½%. Will therefore be over 90% of last summer’s consumption.

This is only way of keeping balance betwn. industries – wh. was reasonably good last summer.

86% of requirements of bldg. industries wd. involve 1½ m. tons more coal.

E.Sh. Industry built its stocks last summer out of current supplies.

R.S.C. Basing now on consumption last summer, not deliveries.

Told to save out of it 3 weeks’ winter stock.

If we had to cut objectively, I shd. have to propose heavier cuts on industries using most coal.

E.Sh. Exports of steel and cement.

R.S.C. Only where we get a big return.

R.S.C. Even this p’mme involves big risk.

A.B. Will statement today be so framed as to permit re-considern. Confusion in programmes will be so diff. to defend. Looks as tho’ no coherence in Govt. planning.

Am ready to cut new construction : can’t be expected to stop houses now building.

H.D. Can’t that be done within this proposal.

G.A.I. Problem : relating it to period when industries were expanding.

223

R.S.C. So were other industries.

G.A.I. Effect of this on demand of bricklayers for closing of training centres.

E.Sh. We are trying to do too much – exports, housing, development areas.

Using more coal for inland purposes than we did pre-war.

We shall be forced to discriminate and drop something.

R.S.C. We had a fair industrial balance last summer. Fairly safe to recreate that.

Planning for a selection scheme wd. take 3 months.

A.V.A. Which policy will cause least disturbance of man power?

Last summer was period of movement of labour.

R.S.C. But materials rather than man power is now limiting factor.

H.D. Thought F. Cttee. decision was accepted. If not, let it come up again on a memo.

M’while p’pone statement.

B. These were not hasty decisions by F. Cttee. Need for early statement.

Uncertainty.

Agreed: Postpone decision and announcement.

(Re-circulate F.C. paper to Cabinet.

(Give E.Sh. opportunity of submitting memo of his own.

2. Iron and Steel Industry : Nationalisation Scheme.

[Early part of discussion not heard.]

P.M. Company structure. Where does competition come in?

J. I wd. still prefer a) taking over Fedn. and making it statutory and b) Govt. undertaking all new development.

H.D. No doubt that under this scheme Nat. Bd. will do most new [Exit T.W.

development themselves, outside company structure.

J. Why take over Stewart and Lloyds – most efficient firm. You will lose most of directors : good management staff. What benefit?

Only excuse I can find is they are going to figure in large integrated scheme. But we are going out of our way to preserve companies.

R.S.C. On the technical side.

A. When all are part of State concern, I shd. doubt this.

224

R.S.C. Will arise with overseas buyers : easier to sell under old names and thro’ old organisations.

J.W. eg. Unilever – which doesn’t destroy independence of component companies. Dead weight of old men, once removed, will release a no. of young men who will have a keen competitive feeling as between one company and another.

A. How is competitive keenness to be rewarded?

A.V.A. Will you retain competition in research?

What about competn. in foreign markets between cos. taken over and cos. at x/. finishing end left outside?

A.B. Need all this go into statute?

J.W. Because of novelty and need to explain to industry, we think it necessary to explain fully in a W. Paper – even tho’ not all goes into Bill.

Welcome competition at x/. a good thing.

J.S. Ingenious structure of Unilever, preserving rivalry between subsidiaries: comparative costings etc. And they reward and promote their senior staff acc. to results of such rivalry.

P.M. May we approve Heads of Bill and examine some of these arguments on draft of W. Paper.

J. I still dissent. Foolish to do this at present stage.
