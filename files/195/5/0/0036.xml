C.M. 36(47) 14th April 1947

1. The Budget.

[Exit A.B.

2. India : Compensation for S/S. Services.

P.M. As in memo.

Indian Govt. have v. strong case for refusing to pay compn. to Indians.

P.L. Misprint in tables – draw attention to it.

P.M. But reason : if his prospects were affected by the constitutional change.

P.M. Quoted from Annex IV.

Circs. have changed. If this is their attitude, wrong for us to pay

Indians v. their will.

P.L. Pledge was to individuals not Indian Govt.

P.M. But anyway basis of pledge = compensn. for loss of career and

prospects.

P.L.’s latest proposal : doesn’t meet views of Govt/India and yet

discriminate betwn. Indians and Europeans in ratio. Worst of both

worlds.

Case to be met. War-service recruitment scheme P: decided by Coalition Govt. tho’ announced on 1/6/45 after Coaln. Govt in. This was open to Indians equally – and some were being recruited when it was abandoned. They were to be non pensionable but lump sum grants on 2 bases – one of which was on constitutional changes. L.S.A. pledge : compuls. terminn. wd. carry terms not less fav. than war-service remit.

P.L. Pledge means : he can’t be given less than x. minus capitalised value of pension.

This wd. involve breach of L.S.A. pledge.

My plan is to compensate all but addl. sum to Europeans.

R.S.C. Ind. Govt. have come a long way to meet us : they feel v. strongly on this point.

These aren’t damaged but improved by removal of competition of European members of I.C.S.

H.D. Support P.M.’s view.

This won’t help these men in subsequent career.

P.L. But I still believe you are brking pledge.

P.M. We do provide for men who are victimised. Your plan assumes they will all suffer.

200

R.S.C. And many of them are keen Nationalists.

E.Sh. How can we run counter to Govt/India?

A.V.A. Sympathise with P.L. on pledge. But we must face the facts.

Br. member of I.C.S. will get his compensn. Indians won’t.

But answer is : Indian ought to want to serve his own Govt. A European is justified in saying he doesn’t want to go on serving under alien Govt.

P.M. Annex IV is by reference to war-service remitment scheme wh. was not in fact proceeded with.

Oblign. to pay is on Govt/India. They won’t have this. Viceroy is strongly against it. Apart from victimised few, none will in fact suffer prejudice.

Agreed : as proposed by P.M.

3. Glasgow Dock Strike.

G.A.I. The troops are there : can increase nos. quietly, w’out public announcement. They can then handle other goods. as well as food.

Another announcement. wd. make it look like a strike brkg. act.

C.E. More than perishable goods. Rationed goods must now be cleared too.

P.M. Say if questioned, our stocks here are now such that we can’t afford any hold-ups of supplies. “Going in to m’tain the rations”.

Agreed.
