C.M. 37(47) 17th April 1947

1. Parliament.

[Enter W.W.

W.W. Business for next week.

Civil Aircraft.

A. Conflict between Dpts. v. proposed use of Constellations with B. engineers.

Will arrange a mtg. with C/E. and report to Cabinet before Debate.

Spain Clearing Order.

H.D. Want to be sure of Back-bench support.

Major Legislation.

W.W. Transport : T.C.P. – planned to reach H/L. for 2nd R. before Whitsun.

Now 5/5 for Transport Bill }

15/5 “ Nat. Service Bill }

21/5 “ T.C.P. Bill }

A. Cd. get Transport 2nd Rdg. by Whitsun on that basis.

Might also get N. Service 2nd Rdg. before Recess.

But big block after Recess – when shall we resume? Tues. 3rd June. Cd. we start on Mon 3/6?

P.M. Cd. H/L. sit extra day a week in summer? Or later in the day?

A. I will try to get H/L. back on the Mon. even tho’ H/C. don’t resume until Tuesday

[Exit W.W.

2. India.

P.M. Have had acknowledgmt. from Wavill.

3. Anglo Soviet Treaty.

P.M. Informed Cabinet of developments.

Mc.N. Cab. authy. negotn. w’in framework of Anglo. Fr. Treaty. That involved

assistance in event of attack by Germany. R. draft assumes attack by

any associate of Germany. Dangerous because of Japan. We prefer to

restrict it to associate of Germany in Europe. But even this wd. go

beyond Anglo. Fr. Treaty and wd. therefore require Cab. approval.

202

A.B. Danger that U.S. might use European base (eg. Greece) for attack on R. and Germany then joined in against R. We shd. then be pledged to support R. v. U.S.

P.M. Must come to Cab. formally – on paper – after views of C.O.S. obtained.

E.Sh. Also reactions of Fr. if this Treaty goes wider than theirs.

[Enter B. and J.W.

4. Industrial Emergencies.

C.E. a) want Cttee’s scope enlarged to cover emergencies fr. whatever

cause.

[Exit C.E.

5. Wheat Supplies.

b) want authority to plan at Regional level. Need to avert University students and other Fascists taking matters into own hands.

Want to consult Ch. C.’s so tht. skeleton organn. can be made ready to act, under aegis of Govt.

P.M. Previously we were repealing Trade Dispute Bill. Circs. are now different.

H.D. No publicity.

C.E. No unavailable publicity certainly.

A.B. My Reg. organn. involved. Against recent background of snow and flood we can do now what we cdn’t do before.

Want to consult with C.E. v. choice of Regional repves.

R.S.C. Reg. Bds. shd. be used.

P.M. That is for the Cttee.

R.S.C. Hang this on to recent emergencies and do it quickly.

P.M. Let Cttee. consider what they want to do and recommend what publicity is required.

J.S. Para. 4.

May : 5.2. 31/5: 6.7. June 8.1 or 9. On basis of Mackinnon’s latest promises.

Even so, this isn’t enough to warrant risk of no action. Most we cd. do is reduce period of 6 wks. to 4 for reduced extraction rate.

203

Save 35.000 t. of wheat : but even more important wd. discourage bakers from increasing stocks.

Shan’t cut feeding stuffs.

P.M. a) Jan/Feb. were survived with stock of 5.2 wks. Previously we were told that minimum working stock (Nov. last) was 11 weeks or so.

b) Off-take 106.000 tons. We are saving nothing then from rationing.

J.S. At 100.000 t. off-take we are saving only 3.000 t. p. wk. by rationing.

I agree tht. at end/summer we must decide wthr. to abandon rationing

or to make it more effective.

P.M. c) Prev. request to make rationing more effective.

J.S. Can’t really do anything about it.

T.W. Don’t like this. 3 wks. ago I appealed for increased livestock breeding. In bad weather have had to spend 25.000 t. of feed to keep hill sheep going. This wd. give us deficit. Will M/F. really be able to supply from other sources. Farmers won’t believe it, anyway, and it will retard breeding. Can’t we take the risk?

A.V.A. Total disposals of flour fr. bread rationing to end/Feb. were under 90.000 t. Why then does it bump up so much since beginning of March?

J.S. No restn. on bakers’ drawing from millers. The 90.000 t. figure was consumption. Believe bakers have bn. stocking up.

The rationing scheme permits consumption of 95.500. It is baking to extent of about 5.000 t. Agree it isn’t worth the adminve. cost – unless it can be made more effective.

There is a cushion in bakers’ stocks : but increasing extractn. rate is the way to get that out.

A. They stocked 39.000 t. apparently in March. This plan only saves 35.000 t.

P.M. But if bakers have stocks why not give them less?

A.B. Anyway, the stocks are somewhere.

H.D. Councln. v. increasg. rate because effect on farmers is obvious.

J.S. Re a) above, I admit M/F. experts have grossly exaggerated min. stocks.

T.W. Try to make bakers avoid drawing more than they need during this period.

A.V.A. Cdn’t the millers control it?

204

J.S. They won’t – they can’t decide who is to go short. I’ve asked them.

Let bakers be told tht. in March they drew 10% more than average :

they can’t therefore have more than 90% of demand for next month.

A.V.A. March off. take is higher than any month since May ’46.

Agreed (inexpedient to raise extraction rate

x/. (millers shd. aim at issuing less

(bakers shd. be told not to draw as much

(public shd. be warned not to waste bread.

J.S. O.k. if x/. proves practicable.

But if not, it won’t do to take no action. I must come back to Cab. next wk. if stock posn. deteriorates further.

6. Wheat Conference.

J.S. Compromise approved by O.E.P. failed to attract any support

Exporters have now returned to original posn. on duration and price.

Our Delegn. must now stand pat.

Will prob. mean p’ponement of Conference.

Agreed.

[Exit Mc.N., T.W.

7. Nationalisation of Steel and Gas Industries.

P.M. Ques. for Cabinet is – which Bill goes fwd. this next Session?

A.G. F.L. Cttee recommended only one nationalisation Bill.

Bills on floor : electoral reform, India and Burma.

Many Bills with dates wh. must go thro’.

There is a full p’mme in itself.

From Parly. angle, Gas wd. be the easier.

Steel wd. be v. controversial and take more time than we cd. give next Session.

But if we shall have to use Parlt. Act on it, that is argument for starting it next Session.

E.Sh. Bad Bill to choose for use of Parlt Act. Esp. as there will be controversy w’in Parlt. on merits of Bill.

In favour of Gas Bill a) has bn. hanging around for some time ¨Heyworth Cttee : uncertainty in industry. b) N.C.B. will have to do much carbonisation because takg. over coke ovens. c) Complete the trilogy to secure co-ordinated fuel policy.

A.B. Major political strategy. Need we decide.

205

R.S.C. Cd. Steel Bill be ready in time for presentn. in autumn.

J.W. Yes.

A.B. The longer you p’pone, more encouragemt. you give to idea tht. we are being frightened off.

A.V.A. If we don’t do this now, we shan’t do it in this Parlt. I therefore favour going on.

H.D. I wd. like to see both Bills taken next Session – completing the socialising policy. Know that can’t be done. But there is weakness on steel in the Party : we must keep to the Left of the Party in this matter; and we must be firm.

We want a fight with H/Lds. That will cheer people up.

At beginning we put the diff. Bills first. Now again we shd. give priority to the more controversial of the 2 Bills.

M/F &amp; P. is overwhelmed with adminn. Give him this interval before he goes on with Gas Bill. Promise it (as far as you can) for 4th Session.

E.Sh. Co-ordinn. of fuel policy has for years bn. prominent plank in Labour p’mme. Since 1921. T.U.C. also.

I’m as keen on socialn. of steel as anyone. But fr. the start I’ve bn. doubtful about this scheme : and even at last mtg. of S.I.C. expressed misgivings. Will Party accept it as consistent with Socialist principles.

Gas post in S. Wales – where undertakgs. have virtually broken down. If we are to supply devel. areas we shall have diffy.

Are we to give electricity too long and start over gas? It represents large capital investmt. by l.a.’s.

If both Bills could be taken next Session. I wd. prefer that.

A. Agree much depends on temper disclosed by H/Lords. this summer. It will be impossible to do both next Session.

H/C. will have much on Floor next Session.

We may have Parlt. Bill : if so, must be next Session.

If it’s a choice between the 2 Bills, my normal instinct is to put the more diff. Bill first. Ques. Parly. tactics because I wd. put Steel first – if we agree to the project.

R.S.C. Favour steel. If not this next Session, not at all.

Pity we can’t have both.

J. Feel strongly the other way.

Vital to get Gas thro’ to complete fuel policy – and pretty easy to get that thro’.

P’mme for next Session already longer than practicable. It is not facing facts to suppose you can add Steel to it.

Far too much on legve. plate already.

Anyway, I don’t favour this steel scheme : which will give you worst of all worlds. Wd. prefer a new national plant in Lincs. 206

Don’t be commd. to any such scheme.

J.W. Only if this scheme is quickly approved.

Steel Bd. has approved £50 m. tin plated scheme in S. Wales. We are

assistg. in creation of huge private monopolies – and workers want to

know if it’s to be private.

Whatever scheme, we can’t hope to get it thro’ next year.

P.M. Said in W. Paper fuel is basis of economy. Will be said we have burnt fingers with coal and electricity and now are running away fr. gas.

If you want steel to be issue with H/Lds., time it.

Parlt. Ministers and machine all overworked.

Boards still in experimental stage. And now you pick on diff. industry like steel.

Can you be ready by Oct?

P.M. But one hour’s Cab. won’t settle it.

J.W. Effect on industry. Need for max. output and big re-organisations.

Much political interest – first incursion into real industry. Party want to know what we are doing about it. Debate May ’46.

Cab Ministers have since re-affirmed decision to bring steel under p. ownership in this Parlt.

Sc. steel industry gripped by Lithgow, is pursuing monopolistic policy and we are assisting it thro’ the Bd.

Announcement of legn. however, may have bad effect on output.

Ques is: shall we go on next Session or p’pone for this Parlt.

If we put it off, pol. controversy will rage round industry for next 3 years.

Least evil therefore is to go forward now.

A.G. Doubt if this Bill will be ready quite so soon.

J.W. Parly. Counsel have bn. in on this.

B. Gas.} A., A.V.A., C.J. } Steel

“ } A.B., R.S.C., G.T.}

J. “ }

A.G. “ }

P.L. “ }

G.A.I. “ }

P.M. Predominant views : go on with steel.
