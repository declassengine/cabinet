R.S.C. Endorsed this compliment.

E.B. Fusion Agreement signed at last. Removes liability of nearly £125 m.

in dollars for 1948. Maximum liability £28 m: &amp; U.S. will try to keep it below £10 m. And may be less if trade goes well.

Higher steel out put figure enables us to plan.

1850 calories: food requd for that. If they can reach 6 m. tons of

Tho’ that’s too low it’s better than existing 1550.

Strang’s patience.

Goes far to implement Cab. policy of no more dollars on Germany.

U.S. regard this as relief to us qua Marshall Aid. And + release

of credit they think they’ve done more for us than for Europe.

Noted with approval.

5. Council of Foreign Ministers: Parliamentary Statement.

E.B. Have agreed with A.E. not to deal with future.

That being so, will it suffice if I get P.M.’s approval.

Outlined form of statement –

CFM. purpose, originally, to draft Treaties. Show where it has got to. Unworkable for original purpose. Time spent on Ital. &amp;

E. Europ. Treaties. Cab. decns before Moscow – econ. &amp; pol.

princ.

This was sound working paper if C.F.M. was to work &amp; not be

used for propaganda. Then big issues raised by M. Repns only

incident on wh. break occurred. [Exit A.B.

Events betwn. Moscow &amp; Ldn. mtgs. Cominform etc.

We are consultg. re 2 Zones.

Nothing about future – but promise full debate early after Recess.

Will cover Austria too. R. have made approach on this &amp; we

may get Treaty.

All isn’t necessarily lost. M. didn’t intend this to break. He

overplayed his insultg. tactics. Marshall then said he’d had

enough. Believe M. was stumped.

Discussed posn with Marshall. Shall go quietly. Nothing dramatic.

But Cab. must review posn now. Will submit a memo.

Agreed: E.B. to settle with P.M.

3 members for 213.000.

as cpd. with rest of England. Scotland &amp; Wales are already over-

are already over-represented by nos. in comparison with England.

If we divided we shd. have 16 boros with over 40.000 electors.

We shd. then get into diffies with divided boros e.g. B’fd. with

Result wd. be in the end substantial increase in total nos. of M.P.’s.

P.M. You adduce as reason B’fd., one of worst examples. B’fd. shd. have

more than 3 on merits.

C.E. Commrs. have regard to area of ground. Shropshire = co. in wh.

spread as well as total of electorate must be considered.

P.M. Well, compare B’fd. with Hull. Or Blackburn with Darwen.

C.E. By dividing you wdn’t get 2 Labour seats.

Once you alter Commn’s Rpt. you have to defend all the recommns

for yourself – can’t pray in aid the independent Commn.

We by our Bill removed mathematical basis for Commn’s work (?).

Commn have prepd unofficial scheme for dividing these 8 boros

if Parlt. wishes it done. They don’t recommend it.

P.M. Abolition of University members gives us some room to increase.

H.M. May be pressure we can’t resist. H.O. shd. look therefore at

x/ repercussion of makg. a concession. May be forced to it.

G.T. Lancs. prefer this to earlier scheme.

P.M. Bradford and Hull. How can you defend it?

R.S.C. With these stocks Admy. cd. do more. a) by releasg. stocks for

commercial use or b) by releasing more tankers.

The worst moment at which to lose c.i.f. payments.

A v. critical time.

P.M. And 17 months’ stocks.

Where are these stocks &amp; where cd. they be used.

H. Can’t feed Med. needs out of stock. Need 5 tankers for that.

That’s the most hopeful line.

Anglo-Iranian at Abadan – puttg. the oil into ground – may lose

concession. At least be criticised. Want maximum drawn off

from Persia.

b) Abadan.

dollars.

us to use tankers for c.i.f. sales.

A.V.A. Must have strategic reserve. 400/500 t. needed to mobilise Fleet.

P.M. What wd. you do with Fleet? There are no Fleets in being.

T.W. If we drew whole of deficit fr. Admy. stocks at home they wd. have

to mobilise Fleet.

R.S.C. Risks on our reserves is much greater than any mil. risk.

J. Economic danger is here

stocks in U.K; shorten hauls by using [Exit E.B.

c.i.f. sales will mean legal, political diffies as well as loss as

Saving tankers to U.K. by using Admy. home stocks wd. enable

400/500 left.
