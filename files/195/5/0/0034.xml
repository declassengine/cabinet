C.M. 34(47) 1st April 1947

2. Parliament. [J.S., W.W., L.S

W.W. Business for the week after Easter.

E.Sh. Fuel Debate 2/4 a) Imports

P.M. Have U.S. considered with suff. sense of urgency? Not ready to accept

this answer. Will take it higher.

E.Sh. U.S. Amb. deprecated our sending a man out. N.C.B, want to take it

further.

Imports : U.S. Amb. asking wthr. exports can be stepped up after this quarter, has been told it can’t be done because transport difficulties in U.S. Since confirmed in writing : best they can offer is anything allocated to Europe which they can’t buy.

S. Africa : offer 50-75.000 t. p. month for bunkers if we can get the wagons for them.

A. 100.000 t. per month per 300 wagons. Relatively small no.

P.M. Not our gauge: no use to us : on order. We shd. try to expedite – both here and in Canada.

P.M. Say tomorrow we are now in touch with U.S. and S.A. authies. – no definite answer yet.

E.Sh. But I’m being criticised : can’t I say there are diffies. on their side? P.M. Say will be done by E.C.O. : we are continuing to press.

b) Domestic Rationing.

E.Sh. Undertakgs. now consulted. Space heatg. restn will secure some saving.

Cooking restns. they are doubtful if savings will accrue.

Shd. we say anything on standard scale? Undertakgs. want 2 wks. to

consider. Want to say we are considering.

Decided this a.m. we shd. go on with this : but not have them on Sundays – no industrial peak and later rising.

P.M. Say we have decided to set targets : are considering details and will announce later.

c) Fuel Allocation to Industry.

R.S.C. Memo. for Fuel Cttee tomorrow.

P.M. Will discuss this then. 187

d) Government Spokesmen.

E.Sh. Wd. like to speak twice with leadr. of House unless industrial restns.

raised in debate.

A.G. Believe it will be a wide debate – R.S.C. will be needed.

P.M. Discuss this at Fuel Cttee Wed. a.m.

b) resumed. Domestic Rationing.

H.D. Why not add coal to prohibns. on space heating.

R.S.C. Drying wet clothes eg in cottages.

E.Sh. Better to restrict deliveries.

P.M. A genl. instn. not to use coal fires merely for heating rooms.

[Enter N.B.

3. Armed Forces: Man Power.

A.V.A. W.S.C.’s suggn. for Select Cttee.

P.M. Can’t be accepted off-hand in debate.

[Exit W.W.

4. India.

P.M. Message of appreciation to Wavill. Approved (not read).

5. Power Station at Bankside.

L.S. Regeneration of South Bank, contemplated in Ldn. Plan, wd. be

thwarted. Development contemplated at Bankside in commercial and

residential City and Dean of St. Pauls feels strongly tht. Power Station

wd. dwarf St. Pauls and ruin St. Pauls’ dominance over the London

river. I wd. not think that argument alone wd. prevail : but it shd. be

taken into account.

Admit R‘hithe delay must be taken for argument’s sake at 2 winters.

But Bankside may be later, because materials, than planned.

P.M. If it were oil. burning, it wd. make a big difference.

L.S. But wd. still mean it was industrial area.

P.M. Not necessarily because Battersea.

188

G.A.I. Development of S. Bank = my pct. It wd. be ruined forever if this were

put there. Derelict business area : interesting assocns. house where

Wren lived still is there. Southwark Boro’ ready to develop for housing

and open space. Only access to river.

Don’t adopt short sighted policy.

U.S. willing to build another Globe Theatre and Mermaid Tavern.

A.B. a) Diff. to resist l.a. decision to violate Ldn. Plan. Worse if we do. b) L.C.C. paid £850.000 for this land with a view to developing S.

Bank decently.

c) R’hithe work cd. be done concurrently and delay reduced.

E.Sh. Same arguments earlier – eg. Wentworth open cast.

Similar arguments elsewhere on power stations eg Durham.

But face the facts. It is agreed that 18 months delay in completing 1st sets at R’hithe is inevitable. Extra cost £907.000 coming on natd industry. R. site hasn’t bn. fully probed.

C.E.B. and Comms. satisfied we must go on. Scott’s provl. plan provides a bldg. not unsightly. Lack of generating capacity can’t be doubted. eg. our diffies. now in

improvising.

Sites down river wd. be extravagant because distance from main load.

G.A.I. Oil burning : &amp; set it back 30 yards to preserve our promenade.

A. What propn. eg p’mme?

H.D. Plan is to get 210.000 k.w.

G.T. Wdn’t affect size of site.

Plain choice between amenities and economic needs.

N.B. Strategic objns. to both proposals : since both are proposed eventually.

P.M.’s decision : para. 2 of memo.

C.A.S. – this, if ever, is a case for cons? strategic points.

W’in circle on map.

We have proposed other sites further down the river.

P.M. Proves too much. An atom bomb dropped there will make such a mess that a few power stations less won’t matter.

This is a 1937 argument now out of date.

L.S. 1.407 m. addl. kw. capacity = p’mme. All decided.

R.S.C. Accept 105.000 kw : but no further growth.

P.M. Has bn. a station there for years. This is an extension.

Agreed : accept Bankside, subject to oil burning and set back 30 yards.

189

[Exit L.S. and N.B. [Enter N. and J.W.

6. Public Boards : Political Activities of Members.

[Exit E.Sh. N. &amp; J.W.

A.B. Dpts. differ because different functions.

[Enter Mc.N

Take note : no publicity at present.

R.S.C. Will involve review of C.S. rules.

H.D. Cttee apprd. Found it v. tricky.

R.S.C. More likely now to be raised.

7. Japanese Reparations. [Enter F.J.B. We therefore prefer tht. our repves. wd. make the points : not insist :

support U.S. proposals.

A. This is a case where Aust. has strong claim. Damage in these Islands

was as bad as anywhere. We shdn’t acquiesce in their exclusion.

Mc.N. As in memo.

Later advice fr. Sansom. Our condn. v. Austr. wd. not find support : nor wd. our view v. China. Bound therefore to fail to reach agreement.

Let U.S. take own line if need be.

P.M. Dislike abandoning Aust. who did most of fighting there.

P.L. Burma’s claim as good as Philippines – shd. have 5% on their own.

R.S.C. Cd. they absorb it? It’s machinery.

Mc.N. Then, when it breaks down, U.S. will proceed unilaterally : won’t consult us at that stage.

H.D. Stand up to U.S. on behalf of Australia.

R.S.C. Shd. also ask for larger allocn. for U.K. – tho’ wthr. we press it can be considered later.

A.B. Likely to have a series of interim allocations. And this will be a precedent.

Agreed : instruct Sansom to oppose U.S. plan unless they add Australia and include larger percentage for U.K. possns. (incldg. Burma). 190

8. Displaced Persons. 9. Agricultural Losses and Arrears

P.M. From brief. Have C. Commn. given instns. for reception of d.p.’s.

Mc.N. I will enquire and report. .

T.W. Govt. support for a scheme of self help by farming community.

Schemes worked out by Advisory Cttee. Will Cab. approve in principle

subject to discn. with Ty?

a) 200.000 acres still flooded. Farmers likely to write it all off for this

year. Can’t afford that. Stimulate therefore by subsidising cultivation

of smaller area wh. wd. involve a loss – i.e. underwriting possible loss.

Acreage payment wd. be best method. Rough estimate £2 m. Wd. also

keep the men on the farms.

b) Special subsidy paymt. for hill sheep to compensate for loss of

income

Second line : stimulate food production for remainder of year.

for loss of animals. Capital loss will be compensated from

other fund.

Much politics in this. Attempt to sap Govt. posn. on food front as on

fuel front. Must check-mate this by prompt and generous action. Hence

proposals in last part of memo v. priorities.

H.D. Anxious to be helpful. Worst aspect : dollar purchase of food.

Don’t forget insurance. Assume that will be taken into a/c.

P.L. What of relative posn. of those who prudently insured and those who

didn’t?

Proposal : base existg. subsidy on nos. in 1946 not present nos. for next 3 years. Over £½ m.

c) Goods : services scheme by Co. Cttees : seeds, implements etc.

Financial grants, I accept. Farmers Fund : accept the £ for £ basis.

H.D. Don’t like para. 11(c). Hope T.W. won’t press that.

T.W. Union will have to get consent of members to start collecting : must give them something to put them in funds.

H.D. Will consider that : but don’t want to be committed to method. As regards a) - c) I am in agreement with T.W.

R.S.C. Procedure. Don’t want legn. Can put in emergency Vote.

191

T.W. Will dedn. come on price of milk?

T.W. No : from farmers’ profit.

R.S.C. By what authority? T. Unions must consider how to do it : and take

responsibility.

J.S. We think levy diff. to administer and may be deterrent to prodn.

H.D. They are voluntary.

R.S.C. Collectively, voluntary.

Consider method : officials (M/F. to sit in). [Enter J.B.H. Had to deny them. Happens every winter. What of claims of bldg.

contractors – just as bad when sites flooded and houses blown down.

We have always said Govt. can’t be responsible.

Wd. rather have an absolute amount, not to be exceeded, than £ for £.

The proposals at a) to c ) are different and I don’t dissent from those.

T.W. Importance of hill sheep farming to our economy – and risks of this

enterprise. They wd. go

A.B. L.a.’s regularly ask for compensn. for flood damage. eg. Salford.

Scotland is claiming too – tho’ not v. severe winter.

Hill sheep. Loss of profits wasn’t admitted even for war damage.

if left with present flocks w’out compensn.

P.M. This is not on basis of individual loss : it’s general and related to our

national food supplies. A.B.’s repercussions can therefore be fought

off.

Incentives

This catastrophe is unprecedented and means so much to our future.

J.W. We must come in because plan no longer limited to flooding.

R.S.C. Something in A.B.’s objn. to accepting unlimited liability on £ for £ basis.

Agreed : Prefer putting up lump sum, as much as farmers ready to subscribe.

Careful statement in consultn. with Ty. By M/Ag. on Thursday.

. Food Rations.

P.M. Spirit of competition. Where does it stop?

J.S. Have added seasonal allowances – for April (earlier). Not in favour of

going further. Anyway haven’t got the meat.

192

T.W. In 5-6 wks. ahead must have much overtime. Must therefore ask for

inducements.

J.S. Ready to extend seasonal allowance after 30/4 : if T.W. asks for it.

R.S.C. Publicise it : O M/Food.

Prisoners of War. “ transmn. to Germany

T.W. Allowed Italians 10/6 a week. Time arrived for some sort of concession to Germans – eg. doubling overtime payment to 3d.

And allow 3/= a wk. to be spent ½ in canteens.

F.J.B. Real incentive : increased rate of repatn.

“ rate of exchange.

Approved in principle : details to F. Labour Cttee.

Production Priorities. Agreed : reject this claim.

A.B. Get statement made verbatim on B.B.C. }

P.M. Will see what can be done. }

A. Food Prodn. campaign. Political diffy. Will T.W. make a report?

R.S.C. Will adjust export p’mme.

But can’t give more super priorities w’out defeating own ends.

} *

P.M. T.W. to submit a report.

10. Germany : Food Production in B. Zone. Responsibility transferred to Germans on 1/1/47.

(R’dam) : increase bread grains in allocations. Also sub office for food

at Minden or Bickfuden.

J.B.H. Lucky not to have had this earlier. V. narrow margins. Irritation of popn. is now getting beyond control of T.U.’s and Parties who must (tho’ still anxious to co-operate) express some sympathy if they are to retain any influence.

Diffies. because fusion. Dispersal of H.Q. Diff. collection fr. farms in U.S. Zone.

Taking it back temporarily. Seekg. U.S. agreement to use diff. ports.

Note taken. [Exit F.J.B. and J.B.H.

193

11. Administration of Criminal Justice in Colonies. Agreed.

J. Want to make it clear tht. authyies. needn’t hesitate to act as soon as a petition is dismissed.

Wd. like the statement strengthened from this point of view.

P.M. C.J. to consult with J. accordingly.

C.E. Para. 6(d) over-states it.
