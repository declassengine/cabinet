C.M. 84(47). 3rd November, 1947.

1. Criminal Justice Bill. [Enter W.W. re

H.M. Discussed at Party mtg. Wed. No objn to introdn of Bill w’out provn death penalty. Between 2/3rds &amp; ¾ however favoured

in Cabinet. Advise tht. we arrange it be not raised in Cttee: can

decision to free Vote. Ques. whether Ministers shd. have

Bound to be raised. Strong body of emotional feeling for abolition.

A.B. Expressed view earlier that these ques’s. (e.g. divorce etc.) shd. be

haven’t. If free Vote, travesty tht. Govt. shd. not be equally free.

too.

A.W. What of Govt’s responsibility for law &amp; order.

Govt. must ask then do we still favour abolition even tho’

H.M. Cabinet cd. take a decision &amp; advise. Tho’ Ministers wd. be free to

abolition. Ministers’ speech (J., C.E. and I) made some

impression: tho’ the mtg. knew there had bn. differences of view

come up on Report: Govt. wd. then state their view &amp; leave

free Vote.

C.E. Endorsed this a/c of mtg.

Wd. be heavy vote in favour of abolition.

T.W. Were repercussions in Germany &amp; Colonies mentioned?

H.M. No.

left to free Vote. We have no knowledge tht. other Members

Thus, endorse H.M.’s recommn save tht. Ministers shd. be free,

P.M. Govt. must take responsibility for consequences.

J. Have read evce given to Barr Commn. All Prison Govrs. save expd

views tht. abolition wd. involve grave danger of extended use

of firearms &amp; had formed tht. view fr. conversns with criminals.

satisfied these might be consequences? I answer: cdn’t favour

it if so satisfied.

But free Vote on a moral issue.

H.M. Govt. must give advice. Otherwise impression of weakness.

Is public opinion ready for this change?

R.S.C. I cdn’t ever vote against abolition.

abstain.

P.M. 1) Moral issue – personal opinion. 2) Effects of abolition – matter

for argument &amp; judgment.

339

Wd. be possible (tho’ difficult) to admit Cab. opinions divided tho’

we gave official Govt. advice.

Cd. we have a Private Members Motion to get views of H/C. – on the

principle?

Cd. we have the arguments in Cab. pp? We aren’t fully informed.

A.B. No diffy. in getting amendment moved.

Motion wd. expose to criticism re Private Members’ time.

H.M. I agree: amendment on Rpt. Stage isn’t different.

P.M. I think it is: for on a Bill Govt. more obliged to take a line.

W.W. Prefer amendmt. on Report.

C.E. If raised in Cttee I cd. get it p’poned until Rpt. For advocates of

abolition want to be helpful on procedure.

P.M. Tories might do it.

G.T. Must consider politics too. Public opinion is not clearly in favour of

abolition – esp. at this time of high crime.

This is political dynamite.

A.W. In Scotland only one hanging for years: but reprieve for that case wd.

have provoked riot in Glasgow because fear of gangster groups.

P.M. Let us have a paper on the arguments }

}

H.D. Incldg. note of Barr Commission. }

General views: some means must [Exit W.W.

be found of allowing a free Vote.

2. Cereals: Bread Rationing.

I. Wheat.

Argentine: crop won’t be in until Jan. Wdn’t sell before end/47.

J.S. Concln: we just haven’t enough to warrant de-rationing, but

v. important to set bread free when we control potatoes as

clearly we must.

Thus, ask for authy to buy the 400.000 t. wh. wd. enable me

to de-ration bread.

Alternative sources.

Russia: concln of satisfy. agreemt. wd. also relieve coarse grains

situation. For a) barley/oats harvest much worse than

expected b) none in W. Hemisphere to buy, with dollars

allocated.

Wd. be affected by course of genl. negotns with Argentine.

340

U.S.A.: might get it, but doubtful if they cd. give it us for purpose

of de-rationing bread, when pressure to supply other countries

much worse off.

Potatoes: prospect no better. Cd. buy 100.000 t. fr. Canada at

£1¼ m. in dollars.

Want large acreage of potatoes next year.

P.M. Annex I para. 2.?

J.S. 5886 is what we asked I.F.C. to allow us. They prob. won’t give us

as big an allocation. But exporters aren’t bound by I.F.C. “recommns”.

5082 is effective figure of what we expect to get.

P.M. Canad. shipmts?

J.S. Critical period: April. Ques. of tonnage to lift from Vancouver

P.M. Is diffy. procurement or shipping?

J.S. Both.

P.M. Wd. the alternative sources help if diffy. is shipping?

Shipping can’t be limiting factor for U.S. supplies.

R.S.C. The extra 400.000 is suggested so as to avoid diffies wh. wd. otherwise

arise if shipping were not available in proper time etc.

E.B. Cdn’t timber shipments fr. W. coast be stopped in interest of wheat.

Ldn. docks clogged with timber. Cdn’t food be given higher

priority than timber?

H.W. We have agreed to suspend timber shipments for 3 mos.

Being considered at offl. mtg. this a.m. Other considns arise

of course incldg. effect on Can. trade negotns.

A.B. Does this mean redn of p’mme?

E.B. No: only timing of shipment.

A.W. Divert to Leith, Grangemouth &amp; Bo’ness.

H.W. It isn’t port capacity mainly, its shipping.

Agreed: M/T. to switch to wheat fr. W. coast.

J.S. It wd. be helpful if shipmt. cd. be raised from 60.000 to 100.000 t.

p. month.

341

Australian Contract.

H.D. a) Wd. P.M. send personal message to Chifley.

R.S.C. He knows all about it: it’s political fight because Wheat Bd.’s

position.

A. Chifley &amp; Pollard favour abolishg. some pretensions of Wheat Bd.

They wd. like a crack at it.

R.S.C. Consult High Commr. in Ldn. first.

J.S. May I suggest to Beasley tht. P.M. is willing to telegraph.

H.D. Tell him P.M. is going to do it.

E.B. Let P.M. send for Beasley = &amp; discuss it with him. Agreed.

A. b) Quantity. 30 m. bushels in memo. I was told it wd. be 50 m.

J.S. Diffce is how much comes to U.K. &amp; how much to areas for which

U.K. buys.

A. No: minimum figure allowg. for dependent countries was 50 m.

This figure in memo. represents a redn by Wheat Bd.

H.D. Then let P.M.’s message cover quantity too. Agreed.

J.S. Estimate of harvest is rising.

But these additions won’t help until next year. Because of rate of

shipment. No possibility of increasg. early shipment. Anyway

100.000 t. p.m. clearance from ports is most Australia can do.

J.S. We are urging them. Shdn’t rely on it.

H.D. Why not quicker build-up?

E.B. Lifting enough by liner?

N.B. Will enquire.

Lifting 11.000 p.m. now. But at cost of extravagant use of shipping

&amp; prs. U.S. chartering.

R.S.C. These figures of shipmt. shd. be translated into arrivals.

E.B. Improvise – go all out – non-dollar wheat and freight.

342

{ P.M. Let R.S.C. consider wtr. liaison betwn. M/F. &amp; M/T. Agreed. {

{ H.D. Wd. rather have dollar ships carrying non-dollar

{ wheat.

T.W. Don’t think we are out of the wood merely by getting thro’ early part

of year.

Argentine.

H.M. Have we a machine wh. is really getting down to concerting business

with Argentine. Shdn’t we send a Mission? Gavin.

E.B. Mission about to leave.

H.D. They are takg. no dollars pro tem. in order to buy the rlway &amp; trams.

Have p’poned on that a/c sending a Mission.

H.W. Will prob. be headed by Paton, once head of U.K.C.C.

J.S. Support H.M’s view. Not optimistic. Miranda threatening to shut

off exports e.g. maize. Must bring it to a head. This is more

important than any other negotiation. Hope will be given

priority both in personnel and cards.

H.M. Gavin again.

E.B. One at a time. This is b/paymts. and trade. Don’t mix Gavin up in

that.

Delay h’to due to B/T. desire to be sure what exports we can

guarantee.

H.W. Agreed with E.B.

Russia.

H.W. Propose to re-open twds end Nov.

E.B. Convertible sterling. Stalin doesn’t want dollars. Don’t offer

convertibility.

H.D. Rule must be: no gold or dollars for Europe.

R.S.C. That is agreed.

N.B. Important to Canada too: when re-negotiating bacon.

343

J.S. De-rationing won’t be affected by total. But by increased rate of

shipment.

Agreed

Must have another 400.000 t. by end/crop year.

A.B. Diffy. – for dollar reasons we try to get more fr. longest-haul

source (Australia). Thus, we seek 400.000 t. quickly from

a nearer source.

General view: can’t see clear enough to know wtr. we

shall be able to de-ration by end ’47.

P.M. Stocks. Are the assumptions too conservative?

R.S.C. Table II shows them tapering right off by June. That is danger point. : Can’t re-ration now.

H.D. No dollar commitment now for the extra 400.000 tons.

Agreed

Dollar diffy. is too acute. : Look for extra 400.000 t. in Australia or in

II. Coarse Grains.

Russia: not in dollar countries.

N.B. Passionate anger in India if we de-rationed bread.

J.S. Barley is only hope – fr. Russia – to offset crop failures.

R.S.C. And a bit from Yugoslavia &amp; Roumania.

H.W. And they want steel, heavy electrical plant etc., - all things which

H.M. Kitchen-waste salvage?

everybody wants.

T.W. Crucial importance of coarse grains to agriculture p’mme.

Russia is big source: go for that.

H.W. May get somethg. out of Yugoslavia: prob. not fr. Roumania.

But from Curtain countries won’t take consumer goods.

Askg. all the time for war potential goods.

A. Barley: p.13. Is more for distillers &amp; maltsers really wise?

T.W. This is coming fwd. on another paper.

P.M. No commitment.

J.S. Cd. get 100.000 t. of Australian barley. Ty. wdn’t authorise

purchase at price asked. Now have authy but price still higher.

Decision shd. be confirmed re exceeding ceiling. 344

III. Potatoes: Rationing.

J.S. Must introduce on Mon. next. Generally agreed.

Rate: 3 lbs. to start. 2½ lbs. wd. be easier to defend

in spring. Also de-rationing of bread may come later.

A.W. Form on other cuts was to go down to bottom first &amp; improve later. Agreed. 3 lbs.

H.D. Against existg. dollar wheat. Agreed

J.S. Can we have Cn. potatoes? £1¼ m. in dollars.

. M/F. to discuss with H.D.

Acreage for 1947.

Let R.S.C. discuss with T.W. and J.S. Agreed.

T.W. Proposal of J.S. is impossible. Over-insurance.

3. Sugar.

J.S. Submitted to warn Cabinet.

P.M. Why a flat 25% on each?

R.S.C. Better to keep jam as now and let cake go lower.

H.M. Ice-cream can go wholly. Why not let M/F. use discretion.

A.B. My advisers say it’s unwise to reduce energy-bldg. food now.

A. Nutritionally dangerous.
