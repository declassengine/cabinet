1.

Anglo-Soviet Treaty.

[Enter J.S. &amp; H.McN

Mc.N. As in P.M.’s memo.

R.S.C. F.O. v. form of Fr. Treaty. Suggestg. economic formula wh. goes less far : omits in particular provns. for constant consultn.

H.D. Keep as close as poss. to Fr. text.

Mc.N. Our economic relations are not so close with Soviet.

R.S.C. Want them to be. R. if commd. to paper formula wd. play. Might object, but we shd. offer it. Public and Parly. posn. here.

Mc.N. Anglo. Fr. Cttee was already existg. when Anglo. Fr. Treaty concluded.

Agreed : offer text of Anglo. Fr. Treaty on economics.

P.L. Recalled argument about provocative action of Fr. v. Germany.

This is even more alarming in case of R.

A. Diffy. with Doms. v. short notice over Fr. Treaty.

Want to inform Doms. now what is afoot and send them provisional

text.

Mc.N. Already in that posn. under Art. 107.

We are safeguarded by Charter.

More time here for consultn. and more need for it because suspicious of R.

Shd. tell Canada how far U.S. being kept informed. Agreed.

2. Cyprus.

P.M. Reasons for not giving effect to Cab. decision of 11th Feb.

Noted.

3. Palestine.

J. Why has martial law bn. abandoned tho’ outrages continue.

C.J. Economic paralysis. Some co-opn. by inhabitants in giving informn. : this might have bn. discouraged by continy. of m. law.

Mil. authies. were satisfied tht. it shd. be discontinued.

P.M. What next? Mil. action has bn. ineffective in checkg. terrorism.

159

C.J. Will circulate H.C.’s latest telegram.

J. V. unsatisf. This looks like weakness.

P.M. Agreements for raising m. law are strong:

Agreed : Cab. Thursday.

4. Debate on Defence White Paper.

A.V.A. Defence debate : pressure to review our commitments. What can be said about U.S. help to Greece. Can we consider on Thursday?

A.G. Will see dissidents today. Motion calls for review : Tories will support that.

H.D. Must be continuing review by Cab. – nothg. fresh about this.

J. You cd. accept this.

A.G. No : a further review. This wd. be moral defeat.

A.G. to see dissidents.

5.

Expansion of Fuel : Power Resources.

[Enter Key. Woodburn. Barnes. Edwards.

A.W. Plant Cttee re-convened. Progressing machinery being establd. for i)

and ii).

Petroleum Bd. to carry on with iv) in close contact with M/Supply, on progressing.

E.Sh. P. Bd. are in constant touch with manufrs. : can look after it better than a new organisation.

P’mme will save 2 m. tons in summer : but 8 m. early in ’48.

Conversion of big power stations. We’ve bn. let down by C.E.B. Now propose a techn. Cttee with Tizard, if poss. in Chair. Started by views expd. by boiler makers.

C.E.B. don’t control undertakers, and latter prefer coal to oil.

H.D. Supported E.Sh. views v. C.E.B.

A.W. Delays in placing orders under (i). Am pressing for quicker decision.

E.Sh. When Coal Bill was in Cttee in apprd. organising Cttee to get on with planning. 160

Think we must do this for electricity – in advance of natn.

A.W. Told oil burning disintegrates furnace bricks. Enquiring into that.

P.M. Must expedite orders for long term.

Short term. Nothing shd. stop going on with conversion.

Wh. will bring benefits this winter.

R.S.C. Progressing – on the spot – wd. expedite (iv).

E.Sh. That is for Pet. Board.

A.W. M/Supply are progressing tankage and conversion for rlways.

Will submit progress report. Sending mission to Germany.

A. Is there a p’mme for (i). Who makes it?

R.S.C. German firms can do it.

E.Sh. C.E.B. submit p’mme for approval of El. Commrs. On extensions.

On replacement, undertakers deal direct with manufacturers.

M/F &amp; P. have no powers over Commrs. or C.E.B. nor have they over the undertakers.

C.E. Need for simple standard specifications. To ensure speed in new manufacturers.

A.W. Short term : must use existg. plant : patterns of firms.

P.M. C.E.B. must take a firmer line with fads of undertakers’ engineers.

R.S.C. Manufacturers can help.

A.W. Will report back if any diffy.

E.Sh. Gas : shortage of silica bricks.

C.K. Will enquire into this.

Few manufacturers of plant.

P.M. Silica in Euboea.

B. Can transport be widened up to cover all locos etc.,

Also can rails be included?

P.M. Materials Cttee can consider rails.

C.K. Bldg. labour. Means at expense of other activities eg. housing. Memo to L.D.C.

161

Have apprd. Cttee under Durbin to deal with consequences. B/T. shd. be added.

Cab must recognise tht. it will cut into other p’mmes.

Gas. Recruitment of gas retort setters. M/L. are working on this.

G.A.I. I have said this is overriding priority for labour – in my Dpt.

A.W. Atomic energy not affected?

P.M. No.

[Exit E.Sh. Barnes. Key. Woodrow

[Enter Paling.

6. Care of Deprived Children : Central Responsibility.

A.G. Explained work of Cttee.

Central point : no specialist Dpt. can stand in loco parentis.

No hope of substantive legn. this Session. Cd. transfer powers by Order m’while.

In H/C. debate Mrs Nichol made it clear tht. her view was H.O. Reason to believe Curtis Cttee wd have so recommended if w’in their t. of r.

P.M. Considered by senior Ministers. Have note of L.P.’s views.

Take M/H. first.

E. Three points - a) avoid segregation.

b) avoid treatg. as delinquent. c) take simplest adminve. solution.

These points to M/H. who are now respons. for 75% of these children.

A.G. Under Poor Law!

Parlt. : country won’t like transfer to H.O.

P.M. But we are brking. up the Poor Law.

C.E. And Poor Law schools were worst of all.

G.T. Argued at great length. One considn. not advanced yet = heavy load on M/E. and M/H.

Education can’t be separated from well being of child. Development of educn. thro’ meals etc., to cover whole life of child. 162

Favour l.c.a. thro’ special sub. cttee. Middlesex and Surrey recently appld. such a scheme. Don’t believe Specl. Children’s Offr. will work.

L.c.a. assuming more and more of this work.

Logic, I admit, is that M/E. shd. take over Juvenile Courts.

C.E. H.O. wdn’t segregate. Wd. treat children as individuals.

Offenders – matter of accident.

Removal of child fr. parents – must be for courts, not for adminve. machinery of any Dpt. other than that respons. for justice.

Functions of M/E. and M/H. insprs. are specialist : doctor or teacher.

H.O. treatment of case work on basis of individuality.

If this work goes to l.c.a. there are too few children to warrant separate treatment. Will be a matter of educational units.

H.O. experience. Less criticism by Curtis Cttee than for insprs. managed by other Dpts.

R.S.C. Exhausted enquiry under Coalition Govt – favoured H.O. Still adhere to that because H.O. have not so much on their hands.

P.M. Balance of argument in favour of H.O.

Also mustn’t restrict H.O. to repressive functions.

[Enter H. Shawcross.

G.A.I. Support H.O. on basis of experience on Juvenile Ct.

Agree : Transfer central responsibility to H.O.

W.P. Specialist responsibilities of M/Pensions.

Agreed : insist sentence in announcement on war orphans.

J.W. Willing to follow English decision.

Will transfer to S. Home Dpt. : larger local authies.

A.G. Also inter-depart advisory Cttee.

E. Transfer of stat. functions to H.O. Shd. be carefully examined – don’t want H.O. to have to administer Poor Law code in interim period.

C.E. Offl. Cttee can work this out.

H.D. Care in presentation. H.O. and Police. [Exit Edwards, Paling.

7. Imprisonment (German and Austrian Sentences) Bill. Diffy = danger of raising ques. of status of our courts in G.

J. J.B.H. has promised (w’out date) legn. on this subject.

Legal view : there are G. courts because C.C. = Govt. of Germany. Then with whom are we at war?

163

Believe we can say techn. state of war existg. pending concln. of Treaty.

Must warn Cab. all these ques. may be raised – esp. by those who question our right to retain German p.o.w.

Wait until the trouble gets worse.

Agreed : postpone.

H.S. Will give rise to discn. of these points – wh. will be embarrassing. But those ques. will arise sooner or later anyhow. Intern. Court might not uphold the view tht. we are at war.

G.A.I. Only sufferers fr. delay : chaps in G. prisons. Shdn’t they suffer, rather than we.

A. Shall have to ask Doms. wthr. they want their nationals removed to Doms.

McN. Cd. G &amp; A courts not rule tht. persons sentenced may be impd. here?

C.E. Accommn. in U.K. prisons is not v. comfortable. And popln. is not contented.

A.G. This obviously wd. be controversial Bill. We are already. in arrears with p’mme.

J. My view is tht. this handful of B. subjects must languish longer in G. prisons.

8. Abolition of Special Juries.

J. Judges agree – subject to City of London.

Announce our intentn..

Agreed.

9. Coal : Five Day Week.

P.M. N.U.M. mtg. this a.m. Better spirit. Believe they will get as much in 5 days as 6. Can it be moved? Other suggns. Unlikely to offer p’ponement. No option but to introduce it.

H.D. Cd. we re-open it later, if experience shows this optimism isn’t justified?

P.M. Prod : figures will be circulated to Cab.
