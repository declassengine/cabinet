C.M. 90 (47) 25th November, 1947 1.

Food: Christmas Bonuses Less than 1946: but all we cd. do. [8d meat : 1½ sweets for

Cakes: no good because flour rationing.

E.B. Not worth doing for Gravesend.

J.S. Will announce in ordinary course next week.

J.S. Cdn’t distribute more.

2.

J.S. 6d meat: 1½ lbs. sugar: 4oz sweets.

young &amp; old: cakes &amp; turkeys – 1946]

R.S.C. Relate meat to increase from Eire.

A.B. Still more sugar?

Foreign Affairs

Council of Foreign Ministers.

E.B. Not optimistic about C.F.M. Likely to break down. No advance on Moscow. Rumours re strikes fomented by Communists. May be tried here.

G.A.I. x/ Being done here already.

E.B. Not on same scale as in France &amp; Italy.

Problems cd

Saw M. last night: said nothing: hinted Soviet Union subject to threat but didn’t answer when I said “by whom”. Tactic: when about to move, complain tht. others are threatening. be settled save for ideological drive.

Ruthless drive to eliminate middle parties.

T.W. Publicity here &amp; in Europe.

E.B. Pretty good – U.S. station at Munich.

But I haven’t encouraged anti-Comm. drive. Rather putting over the

new social democratic Britain. Can get that into R. to which we

are still b’casting: know it’s doing good. We shdn’t have much

chance in competition denunciation – tho’ we may be driven to it.

A.B. But Comm. Party of G.B. is not

Czechoslovakia now going to be swallowed.

carrying out Moscow policy – as in

France. Beware of x/ = don’t suggest our unofficial strikes are

instigated from Moscow.

363

H.W. Troubles in U.K. caused by Trotskyites not Communists.

A. Is communism growing in T.U. movement?

E.B. Getting control – thro’ office.

N.B. Labour Party are tackling that now.

H.M. Can Genl. Council get on to this – and restore the “black circular”

which they w’drew.

G.A.I. Ldn. Trades Council now under Comm. control. Believe T.U.C. might

now restore the circular which they had to w’draw at the time

because prestige of Red Army.

E.B. Fear R. may play this game too long &amp; provoke war thro’ U.S. loss of

patience.

A.B. Leon Blum = pressure of 3rd force: will be reaction in France v.

Commn and swing too far, on to de Gaulle’s side. That is point

which we shd. press. Re-action to Fascism will be worse for

workers. Their hope is in central Party. We shd. stress that more

&amp; more openly.

Dangers of the 2 alternatives.

We cd. rally people behind that.

E.B. Cd. Cab. meet specially to take stock of our position? After C.F.M

mtg.

Have bn. waiting to see whr. that wd. break down.

Working party: not of officials this time.

Then carry T.U.C. &amp; Party Executive with new policy.

P.M. Yes: as soon as we know how C.F.M. is going.

Palestine

E.B. Told our Delegation to abstain from voting – on the 2 solutions.

This is consistent with our earlier attitude.

U.S. not worried over Arab re-action. But I am.

Before we settle our next step, must know how vote goes.

Can’t accept U.S. attitude of expressg. views &amp; still refusing any mil.

assistance.

A.B. We shd. discuss. Are we going to facilitate creation of authies to fill the

vacuum we have.

P.M. As soon as ques. emerges from the Cttees.

364

Japan: Peace Treaty Evatt won’t agree unless he

E.B. We agreed to U.S. proposal for 11- Power Confce. (14 incldg. India, Pakistan &amp; Burma) with 2/3 rds majority. Chinese put in proposals [conflicting with Sino R. Treaty: on wh. R. claim Chinese were commd to unanimity rule.] for Confce with unanimity rule.

Now told U.S. have accepted that – contrary to own original plan. has right of veto or is allowed to exercise

U.K. veto (!).

3. Select Committee: Allighan Case : Motion affecting Press.

Must settle this week.

N.B. A &amp; N.Z. strongly support voting rules agreed at Canberra.

India too.

We must fight to the last for Canberra Rules.

Propose to stet: up to “displeasure of this House.”

Propose to substitute “&amp; may, if House thinks fit, be deprived of

any facilities wh. he may enjoy w’in precincts of House for such

period as House may determine.”

A.W. Why not leave penalty to be determined when it arises.

R.S.C. Shdn’t Motion make it clear it’s a breach of privilege.

A.B. Do party want to go on with this?

H.M. Yes: Must have means of dealing with bribes.

Agreed: Leave first part. Second part indicating merely that

H.M. Motion warning Press – on Allighan Debate. Read Motion.

Second part of Motion wasn’t popular.

J. Yes: this might give impression this was most they had to fear.

A.W. Suggest a limit on powers of House.

P.M. Can’t extend privilege by Motion.

House will then act as it thinks fit.

A.B. Shdn’t we have formula circulated?

H.M. V. well. Memo for Thursday.

T.W. P’pone debate until after by-elections?

H.M. Yes, if convenient. 365

4. Balance of Payments.

R.S.C. At Liaison Cttee – preferable than by documents.

R.S.C. Shall have to reconsider.

H.G. Imports of inessentials. Diff. to export coal which we are short here.

Can explain in terms of essential imports. But not so easily if

there are inessentials.

Export of coal must be handles with v. gt. care – emphasising what we

get in return. Otherwise, strikes in pits: “the miner is a highly

political animal.”

A.V.A. Para. 15. Near balance save for rest of sterling area.

This is main lesson of memo.

A.V.A. Non-sequitur in this policy.

R.S.C. Coal. Pledged to 6m. to Marshall countries. Doubtful if we can get

essential in return for that. Eire, Denmark &amp; Sweden we are

R.S.C. Mainly for informn. Nothing to add.

N.B. Want co-ordination of informn to work well. But must be 2-way.

Can C.R.O. give Doms. full picture of U.K. position.

T.W. Effect of Marshall Plan?

Nowadays few countries can afford inessentials. Our aim shd. be to encourage increased prodn of essentials.

R.S.C. Accept that general objective.

H.W. But in particular cases we can’t avoid “conditions of sale” wh. involve acceptance even of luxuries.

S.G. Then at least explain it when we must do it.

T.W. Flowers…. (shouted down!)

A.B. And explain it in advance: publicise essential &amp; inessential together.

V. awkward if we have to carry that alone.

Drive for more exports to dollar area: what effect, if at some time switching supplies away?

R.S.C. Plenty surplus to buy in dollar areas when we can afford it.

using coal to get food &amp; timber.

A.B. Will Welsh miners send coal to de Gaullist France?

This is dynamite. Will give Communists a real opening in our pits.

366

P.M. That is the argument of U.S. public who don’t want to send dollars to support a Socialist U.K.

We are being held back.

Denmark owes us £35m – even if we paid high prices we cd. take

it out of that.

R.S.C. Mustn’t throw away our cards before we begin to bargain.

J.S. No power – Danes can sell elsewhere at this price. We lose no cards.

We did it for eggs.

R.S.C. But at a more reasonable price.

M/Food to consult with R.S.C. on this.

A.B. Can’t there be priority in these negotiations?

R.S.C. There is already.

J.S. Need to re-inform central machinery.

H.W. Central machine is working v. well. Dpts need strengthening.

R.S.C. Agree – strengthening is regud.

N.B. Para. 12. want man-power &amp; drive behind that.

Is Anglo-Iranian Co. doing all it cd.?

Too much readiness to accommodate U.S. companies.

R.S.C. We can get Marshall coal v. some useful imports fr. Marshall countries.

J.S. P’mme burdens official machine – direction of exports, bi-lateral negotiations. We are missing food chances because not enough officials to do all negotiations at once. Lost 300.000 t. of Danish butter y’day because not ready to undertake wholesale negotiations.

R.S.C. Ques. of finding means of reducing Danish prices.

J.S. 48.000 t. available in ’48; and we may lose more.

Ask for latitude to do some piecemeal buying in these circs.

Ty. think purchase at this price will weaken out genl. bargaining position.

F.A.O. cd. do more.

R.S.C. Not diff. Doing nothing.

E.B. W. Party on oil. How is that going?

We cd. use oil as effectively as coal for Marshall Aid.

367

H.G. No evce of restriction agreemts. etc. Main trouble is steel. Allocn made cripples expansion p’mme.

N.B. Tankers. W. party of M/T and Admy now trying to accelerate repairs.

E.B. Are the Govt. owned cos. playing suff. part in bi-lateral trading.

R.S.C. Am examining that.

5.

[Exit J.S. &amp; H.G.

Emergency Laws Bill: Billeting Powers.

A.B. Opposn may raise powers of billeting. May I guarantee tht. their powers will not be used for persons directed to emplt.

A.W. Impracticable in war.

A.B. Have refused to guarantee limited to specified classes.

Agreed. Assurance may be given.
