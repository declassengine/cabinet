C.M. 81 (47) 20th October, 1947

1. Parliament.

H.M. No line yet about Opposn tactics.

Much business to be done by 31/12. Hope finish D/Address by Wed.

week.

Leave it is P.M. &amp; me with Ch. Whip to work it out.

Far too much talk – leakage. Statement over wk-end by M/H. shdn’t

have bn. made.

A.B. Said nothing fresh.

2.

Wed: motion to take Private Members’ time.

P.M. Get on to economic affairs quickly. H.D. to explain past: R.S.C. to follow.

P.M. Timing. But Press knew. Tribune announced it first.

H.M. Element of surprise has now bn. lost.

A.B. Anyone cd. have guessed the Parlt. Act point.

P.M. Timing – points to King’s Speech.

A.B. Then have investigation into Observer = who saw Massingham?

P.M. Select Cttee on proposals for R. Marriage financial settlement. H.D. will submit proposals in due course. (not be to recorded).

Amendment of Parliament Act.

H.M. As in memo.

Stressed – “retrospection” effect of amendment.

Successive Sessions. Can be met by inter-calating a short Session. Only Session which can’t be thus protected is 1949/50 Session: must watch Legve P’mme for that.

P.M. This is reasonable method. Can inter-calate addl. Session.

A.B. Anti-climax to have H/Lds. a full year.

A.B. Will this cover all Bills passed by H/C next

R.S.C. Only a year from 1st 2nd Rdg. in H/C.

C.E. And must be assurance tht. points raised in H/L. will be considered by H/C.

Session?

319

H.M. Yes.

H.D. Applies from one Parlt. to next.

E.B. Don’t foreshadow strengthening H/Lords.

we believe in reform of H/Lords.

[Enter J.S. &amp; Pakenham.

3. Balance of Payments

A.V.A. Any objn from the King?

P.M. No.

Proposal approved.

P.M. Line in Debate: simple measure for shortening delays by H/Lds.

Can quote W.S.C. in debates on Act of 1911.

G.T. Say this isn’t our last word on H/L. reform.

P.M. No need to say this is our last word – and I won’t say so.

Agreed: no words to be used wh. imply that.

C.E. Made clear on Bill of 1911 that Act of 1911 procedure can be used for amending Act of 1911.

Agreed: only a general indication of scope of Bill to be given in Debate on address.

[Exit W.W.

Since 15/9 sold £50m gold &amp; shall have to sell more {11/10 = 59

m$

If that went on, long before end/48, the convertibility posn wd.

have arisen again – f. countries wd. demand dollars or gold.

Suggestions. Decided last week to instruct “stop–buying”

tobacco, until further notice. Shall get some saving on that.

Endorsed recommns from paras. 20 to 30.

H.D. Para. 2. Dollar drain at £17m a week. Wk ending {4/10 = 73m$

Using drawing power on I.M.F. - $180m (£45m) since 1/9.

Buying £20m gold fr. S. Afr. this year.

In spite of all, reserves at end /47 will be down to £500m.

Para. 3 &amp; 4. – effect on Dpt claims.

Cdn’t contemplate that.

Apart fr. any other action, must have quick decn to cut Dpt. requirements of imports.

Para. 20. Aim is to reduce by £175 m.

This shd. be publicly stated. 320

Ford remains. Have discussed with R.S.C. Don’t want to cut food. But if we don’t now, before end/48 we shall have to impose much heavier cuts &amp; shall be at mercy of U.S. Propose redn of £75m in dollar food. No objn to makg. good

what we can fr. non-dollar sources, particularly as likely to be

favourable trade balance with non-dollar world. About ½ of the

£75m represents foregoing increase in existg. rations. Also (para

34) nutritional posn in second half of ’48 nutritional posn wd. be

no worse than now.

Tobacco: propose not to resume U.S. purchase w’out Cab. authy.

Hope for 30m$ saving from this in ’47. And, if contd in ’48 (para

18), instead of £31m from U.S. or £31 –3 m (para. 23) = £28m. –

cd. save up to£28m. But B/T. shd. report on this.

Apart fr. nutritional consequences, consider (p.2) effects on rationing

system. Bound to lead to progressive deterioration. Potatoes as

well as bread: hunger incentive now to brk, thro’ system. Shall

get to Continental condn by end/48: money will be able to buy

what is needed. Ques. of opinion: but that is mine.

My alternatives. There are

Para. 32: total (100m) w’in wh. saving of 75 cd. be made. R.S.C. and I suggest = full saving on sugar: meat ration shd. stay at 1% (16m vice 38): bacon etc., as recommd: cheese no change (5m less): eggs as recommd. This gives 73m vice 100. Don’t press for more than cut of £73m on dollar food.

J.S. Cumulative effect of these cuts following on those already made – 2nd &amp; 3rd para. of 291. Can’t exaggerate consequences. My science. adviser’s view is in this memo. W. Jameson’s in C.P. 294. I support those views.

Can you get output from under-nourished population? alternatives, tho’ mine mayn’t be the best.

Food cuts = wrong approach. Calorie figures wd. have to be

quoted. Shd. have to admit we were sinking below minimum. No

assurance we shall recover in 2nd half of ’48: doesn’t follow we

shall be able to buy all the food in our p’mme – we never have

bn. able to do so up to date.

[Exit H.M.

J.S. Films &amp; tobacco. 28m. on tobacco &amp; 8 on films wd. give 31.

Balance cd. be met by diversion of exports to dollar countries

and/or reducg. home supplies, even clothing.

Food shd. be higher priority even than clothes.

Failing these, raw materials going into home prodn.

R.S.C. This picture exaggerated.

B’down of rationing argument. No reason to suppose we can’t get

back in 2nd half ’48. – e.g. food from Russia. System operates

now: why not then?

Calory content. These figures assume £75m cut.

321

Only alternative suggd by J.S. is increase dollar export. The memo.

already assumes an increase of £45m in ’48. Don’t think it

realistic to assume more.

No real alternative save films &amp; tobacco.

Figures assume 100% naln of export p’mme. Can’t take further risks

on that.

Mustn’t be driven into posn of having to accept U.S. aid on any terms.

£200/300m is prob. lowest reserve on wh. you cd. operate sterling area.

My only doubt is whr. this p’mme goes far enough.

Food: because this is biggest dollar p’mme by far.

Saving in p’mme: £71/2m on this year.

A.B. Calorific consequences if, as now proposed, meat &amp; cheese remain unchanged?

R.S.C. Tobacco: cessation of all purchase wd. enable current consumptn. to go on for 12 months. Thereafter wd. reduce consumption to 20%.

H.W. The £11m for first 1/2 of 1948 may be double counting.

Defer decision.

These figures have high margin/error. My enquiry showed that.

Margin is greater than prospective saving on food.

Meat: cut wd. be psychologically drastic.

B/T. wd. find it diff. to defend cutting food below present levels while we send so many exports to non-dollar world.

Also, why have any whisky in U.K. at all while we can sell to U.S.

Wd. like therefore to go on talking to industry re increasing exports to U.S.

Steel: even less may be available than reckoned in memo.

P.M. Margin of error – may go either way.

H.W. Yes: but of the order of £70m a quarter, on b/paymts. as whole.

J.S. 200m. switch fr. dollar to non-dollar. V. import. we can do it all.

P’mmes are authies to buy. Most unlikely we can get the lot.

P.M. Yet you assume B/T can do more than p’mmed on exports.

R.S.C. Food: calory figure is related to p’mmes. You didn’t then expect to

realise them.

T.W. Worried over bacon ration. Miners.

Defer final decisions. Look at it again.

Most unlikely therefore tht. we shall recover calory level in 2nd half ’48.

Don’t be to quick to abolish tobacco &amp; whisky – psychological consequences there also.

322

G.A.I. Disastrous to cut food. Complaints already tht. men can’t work extra hours because lack of food.

Anyhow, if we must, let this be final &amp; last reduction.

Must then look upwards.

R.S.C. How?

By purchasing moment we shall be better able to judge food &amp; export

position.

J.S. 28 on tobacco &amp; 8 on films + no steel available – would give you the

75 wanted.

Can’t we agree that £75m be saved: and leave it to ingenuity of Dpts.

to decide how, all collaborating?

c) Re-open negotns with Russia.

Agreed: Must find saving of 175m.

A.V.A. Margin of error much more likely to work against, than for, us.

Shall we avoid all

T.W. M/F estimate of 50% cut in potatoes is too gloomy.

Our crop only 80% of last year.

J.S. 14% redn in total supplies. But domestic consumer gets cut from 5 to 3lbs a week.

A.W. Tobacco: cdn’t we reduce consumption to 50% now to avoid straight finish at end/48.

R.S.C. But films: means closing 80% of all cinemas because involves prohibiting all showing of U.S. films.

E.B. Wonder if we assume enough fr. scrounging out of non-dollar world.

Disturbed at what B/T said this morning.

Examples of other sources of food.

a) Eire. Why are fat cattle going to Belgium?

b) Denmark. In spite of v. high prices – we are in extremities. Can’t starve for sake of not offendg. N. Zealand.

E.g. shall we sell all these exports? dollar expenditure on Germany?

But agree with J.S. on admn of rationing. Already people in country

are better off than in towns – symptom of what occurred in

Germany etc. Raids on country resources will break the

machine.

J.S. Alternative sources

b) Eire, if we paid same price as to U.K. farmers.

If we have to cut, better soon than heavier cuts later.

a) might be right to pay Danish prices.

c) Re-open negotns with Russia &amp; pay their high prices.

323

H.D. R. not a non-dollar source, unless you can pay in goods she wants or get her agreemt. not to ask for gold.

P.M. What do M/F think a reasonable reduction? H.D. £37m cd. be done without cut on existg. rations.

only cut on p’mmes involving improvement?

Fatal to make some statement now &amp; have to cut more drastically later.

H.D. Must re-negotiate contract.

[Re-enter H.M.

Sugar. Was 8 until recently: &amp; I was doubtful of its wisdom.

J.S. Loses cheap calories. We’ve got the sugar: doesn’t yield a saving.

R.S.C. But shall have stocks at end of period.

Canned meat. Wd. reduce it to 1.500 t. a month – negligible.

P.M. Can’t we sell more exports to Canada to earn the bacon?

H.W. Some more, certainly: but prob. not £28m.

E.B. The essential things to keep in, on food, are bacon &amp; canned meat.

R.S.C. Don’t balance decn to save imports now against hope of selling exports later. Actual expenditure.

J.S. Then all 175m must come from import cuts?

R.S.C. Yes.

C.E. For 2 mos. people have bn. expectg. somethg. drastic.

Must say the worst now. Hope anything new wd. be improvement.

J. Endorsed that view.

H.D. Anti-climax of July &amp; August. We misjudged the public psych. then.

R.S.C. Havg. taken decn on tobacco, we cd. cut out the canned meat cut.

(viz; not to resume purchase until further notice)

P.M. Bacon: must be m’tained as now.

Must therefore try to adjust Canadian contract.

J.S. Eggs: can’t be stored.

Programme approved, as amended.

R.S.C. authorised to make announcement.

324

[Exit Pakenham &amp; J.S.

4.

Investment Programme.

R.S.C. P’mme of finished houses 140.000: in constn reduced by mid ’49 to figure corresp. with that. Then I wd. be satisfied.

A.B. Agree must be some reduction. But planners pessimistic re run-down of stock. Completion is going faster. About 50% are roofed. P’mme comg. into balance more quickly. Last month started 4.000 new: but approvals fell by 11,000.

Deflation continuing.

15.000 p.m. is grave redn. P’mme of 140.000 is too low, however.

Suggest review June ’48 = m’while p’mme will be brought into balance on assumptions in this memo, viz. 140.000.

R.S.C. Then when do you reach 140.000?

A.B. I don’t want to go below 180.000 p.a. Ready to consider in June ’48 what rate shd. be in 1949.

R.S.C. This is only a way of p’poning decision until next June!

Must decide how many we shall build in ’48.

A.W. Accept objectives – saving material &amp; man-power.

But hard decision may prevent us fr. completing houses wh. wdn’t use more labour etc.

R.S.C. That point abandoned by my covering note.

A.B. Can’t now cut 1948 p’mme = only actual bldg.

How control starting of houses “approved”.

R.S.C. By materials.

A.B. 340.000 houses under constn. None to be stopped?

R.S.C. No.

A.B. Then that = p’mme for 1948.

R.S.C. But I can’t give materials for more than 140.000.

The issue of timber will be limited to 140.000 houses.

That wd. allow finishing of houses in which all timber already built.

A.B. V. well. But review on merits in’48.

Industrial Bldg. As approved by Prodn Cttee.

325

A.V.A. Can’t be committed to-day to further 15% cut. Will consider it.

Will M/H. collaborate with Ser. Depts re housing for Services?

(covered by my note. R.S.C.)

R.S.C. And a Planner.

Defence Research. Can I appoint Sub-Cttee with M/W.

Agreed: subject to the points noted.
