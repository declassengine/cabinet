C.M. 5(47) 13th January 1947

[Barnes : Pakenham: Strachey

1. Transport Workers Strike.

G.A.I. Read from brief.

Present posn. Bd. mtg. today : diff. for them to announce changes before period of notice has expired : if they do, we can’t enforce. Hope they will announce they’re considg. legal posn.

Alterations : establmt. of Joint Ind. Council : cd. get condns. and submit them to Bd. later.

Unreasonable delay. Good case on merits.

Gave informn. v. chances of extension of strike : from brief. Strikers in Provinces mainly local branches of London firms.

London : 13-14.000 cut.

J.S. Emerg. arrangements – 9.30 am today: 600 lorries – 800 Tues. 1.000 Wed. 1.300 Thurs.

Seem to be working smoothly.

Loaders have struck and troops taken over.

Situation in Ldn. in hand – so long as doesn’t spread. Ranks Ldn. Mills out.

Milk delivery then returned

Now in balance – may go either way.

Offl. cttee of 7 Dpts. concerned wd. be useful : to meet daily.

Barnes. Emergency supplies other than food. Need for machinery to decide.

A.V.A. Interdepl. machinery : initiation shd. be with M/T.

Barnes. Done at official level.

A.V.A. M/T. to convene Ministerial Cttee when required.

G.A.I. Only hope = convince men that if they go back quick settlement – and none and until they do. Diff. for a Minister to say so.

E.W. Do employers lose thro’ emplt. of military.

H.D. Do they pay equivalent of wages they wd. have paid.

E.B. Pity the machinery has drawn this out so long.

Legal branch of M/L. v. slow.

Emerg. Rgs. shd. be made permanent law.

First strike for 30 yrs. by men who did v. well during war.

This 1938 Act is not substitute for negotiated condns.

Real grievance = guaranteed day. This shd. be remedied. Was cause of rlway strike of 1919.

P.M. Cab. shd. have known this was pending.

27

G.A.I. Considerg. Reg. requiring Bd. to consider w’in 14 days of appln. Wd. also like to add time limit for considn. Reviewing speeding up all round.

P.M. Joint Ind. Council to short circuit Board.

Maintain supplies m’while.

Against any pronouncement by M/L. on b’cast.

L.P.S. to investigate attitude of B.B.C. towards news of strike.

Ministerial Cttee to take decisions – P.M. to consider composition.

[Exit Barnes and Pakenham.

2. Ground Nuts.

J.S. Limited scheme – going fairly well. Will be able to make a start this year.

Special section – getting this on foot and considering larger project.

Risk of not doing this exceeds risk of doing it.

Margarine ration in 1950 will depend on success or failure of this scheme.

Supplies for margarine now about 50% above dollar sources.

Allocations (internatl.) likely to end 1947 : even if not, we get 1m. tons allocated and we cd. take our supplies from E. Africa.

Need for big effort to develop e. &amp; central Africa.

Propose to report annually.

U.A.C. want to get out of this soon : legn. next autumn to est. Corpn. to take over in Aug 1948.

H.D. Discussed with M/F.

On balance this shd. go on.

Shd. be able to reconsider at annual intervals.

Wanted assurance tht. produce won’t go into internatl. pool. Assured by what M/F says viz., either in addn. or in substitn. for dollar nuts.

x/ Col. Govts. shd. make a betterment payment twds. cost.

This shd. secure (i) better supply of fats and (ii) developmt. of Empire’s food resources.

Legn. not until end ’47. Shd. be done thro’ Corpn. not U.A.C.

C.J. Ready to discuss x/ with H.D. But this scheme will put extra charge on them.

Risks. Labour shortages in this area because of tsetse. Criticism fr. Sisal v. drawing their labour away from this scheme. Trying to control distribn. of labour.

Much machinery requd. Shall want fertilisers : irrigation etc.

Plans made cover this for a few years.

Taken best advice we can and encourage us to go on.

28

T.W. Risks: a) Machinery. Relying on Massey Harris of Canada up to ’49. No chance of getting it here w’out special steel allocatn.

b) Fertiliser : 400.000 t. p.a. = 1/6 our use in U.K. Hope this won’t be at expense of U.K. needs.

c) Technicians at attractive salaries. Few soil chemists in U.K. don’t want to lose them.

C.J. On c) – there are good men in Colonies : v. good nucleus.

On b) – large new deposits in Uganda may be exploited. This therefore foreseen.

E.W. May we in 1950 be faced with situation in wh. we discourage butter eating to get rid of margarine?

J.S. No: we shall want all the fats we can get.

On a) – recognise can’t get much B. machinery for some years. The budget provides dollars for machinery : on basis of saving larger dollar expenditure in future.

A. Support project. But all depends on management. Want reports at early

y/ date on management and thereafter more often than annually.

Can’t guarantee this will be limit of expenditure. Transport eg. will be expensive.

[Exit R.S.C.

Agreed : subject to y/.

A.G. Legn. not this session. Shd. be ready v. early in next.

A.B. Cd. legn. be framed wide enough to cover other such development schemes.

[Exit E.Sh.

3. Japanese Reparations.

E.B. Deadlock in discns. U.S. want to go ahead.

D.O. ask for one more shot in F.E.C.

Can’t think why Austr. and N.Z. want to delay it further.

It hangs up decn. on J. level of industry.

Think we shd. support U.S.

A. R. claims tht. what she has taken in Manchuria = booty.

This particular issue hasn’t been before F.E.C. Doms. say let them express their view. F.O. say R. might use veto and we wd. be even worse off.

29

Suggest therefore we explain to Australia this fear about Veto – danger to authy. of F.E.C. wd. be greater. Wd. like to put that to Australia before E.B. acts.

E.B. V. well : but don’t be long about it.

H.D. B/T. (RSC) favours Australian view : thinks a high level approach fr. U.S. to R. shd. be tried.

E.B. Done already. A. Agree that wdn’t help.

A.B. Mayn’t this be another example of R. shortage of diplomats? Danger of upsetting R. Govt because of incompetence of their repve. on F.E.C.

Austr. and Canada counsel caution.

U.S. unilateral declns. – v. high handed action in Pacific. Dangerous to support her in another.

Don’t offend R. at moment when they are becoming more friendly.

A.V.A. Russia doing v. well out of their 10 day war!

J. Keep in line with Doms. on foreign policy.

E.B. Para 6 of Annex B. This is my line.

Agreed : as proposed by Addison.

4. Malta : Constitution.

A.G. As in memo. Recited history. Complimented Sir H. Macmichael.

Malta Reconstn. Bill next week. Future constitn. will be raised in debate.

Docs. shd. be publd. before that debate.

Col. Affairs Cttee endorse this.

C.J. This restores posn. as betwn. 1921-1933.

Col. Affairs Cttee amended W. Paper to make it clear tht. in emergency full powers cd. be taken by H.M.G.

A.V.A. All will turn on wthr. emergency provns. will be worked.

If no recrudescence of Ital. imperialism, not so much risk as there was.

E.W. Influence of Vatican : must always be borne in mind. It’s more that than Italian political influence.

A.G. C.O.S. are satisfied.

A.V.A. Assented on basis tht. emergency provn. is reliable.

30

5. Subversive Activities.

P.M. Mentioned appointmt. of Cttee. of Ministers and official Working Party.
