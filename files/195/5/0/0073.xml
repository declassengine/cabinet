C.M. 95(47). 15th December, 1947.

1. Death of Earl Baldwin. [Enter W.W.

P.M. Death of Earl Baldwin. Shd. Parlt. adjourn for the day?

Precedents in favour of adjourning after speeches. Save

Chamberlain – war time – Secret Session arranged.

A.E. has no views either way.

H.M. Don’t want a row. Wdn’t matter qua business.

But wd. like practice steered away from automatic adjournment.

Wdn’t this be a good occasion?

R.S.C. Adjourn for e.g. ½ hour?

P.M. Prefer all or nothing.

Will H/L. adjourn?

A. Haven’t decided yet. Baldwin wasn’t a figure in H/L. If H/C. don’t

adjourn, no occasion for H/L. to do so.

Wd. prefer not to adjourn.

Agreed: W.W. to make soundings with a bias against

adjourning but trying to meet wishes of

Conservative Members.

2. Civil List: Provision for Princess Elizabeth.

P.M. Divn of opinion. Carried by majority – higher than our views.

A.B. Cab. members voted v. our decision. Why?

P.M. I wanted to get unanimity: voted with those (incldg. our own) who

H.M. Thought Cab. had fixed a limit – some of us with gt. reluctance.

Majority on Cttee secured by conciliatg. Tory views.

P.M. Yes.

R.S.C. Cttee impressed by evidence – details of salaries etc. Tendency was

R.S.C. Must debate the £5.000 difference.

voted for higher figure.

These are big figures.

4 Labour for larger figure &amp; 5 against.

This may release immoderate Labour opinion. Are Whips on?

to consider higher figures than we had bn. mooting. Unofficial

vote on 35.000 came out as the final vote: indicns of agreemt.

391

being likely on 40.000: thght it wise to put that officially. My 1st proposal was a “suggestion”: not put as Govt’s view.

A.B. They took it as Govt. view &amp; then found Cab. members voting

T.W. Ask minority members not to carry this further?

R.S.C. Not a ques. of principle: only estimate of cost of living in

Turning down recommn of Cttee wd. have unfortunate receptn

3. Economic Affairs.

against it.

P.M. Genl. trend in Cttee as whole was going up.

H.M. But Tories conciliated &amp; our people split.

P.M. They wanted to go much higher.

Clarence House.

N.B. Split betwn. Tory &amp; Labour members wd. have bn. worse.

in country.

J. Must support P.M.’s vote – stoutly.

Agreed: we must support views of Select Cttee.

[Exit W.W.

R.S.C. Little to add to Report.

Internally better: externally worse. Gt. diff. over Canada &amp; Bi-Zonal

Agreemt. Dollar drain not dropping.

H.M. Import/export price movement still going v. us.

R.S.C. Drain still about ⅔ - ⅓ ourselves &amp; rest of area. (Reply to ques.).

Indian demands for dollars. V. good behaviour so far: talks p’poned

till Jan.

manning up. B/T., Cotton Bd., M/L. all

Canada: want available for dollar sales much of what we most want

(e.g. wheat, steel etc.). Their diffy same as ours. Official returng.

to-day.

H.M. Internal. Don’t let’s be too cheerful.

a) Steel scrap.

b) Textiles: are prodn targets high enough?

concerned: is the drive co-ordinated &amp; good

enough?

G.A.I. “Drive” is in hand. Regions surveying female emplt. in other

industries in textile areas: with a view to promotg. transfers.

392

H.W. Agree: a little more steam is requd behind this. Not going as well as

coal. Day nurseries – prs. shd. have 100% grant.

A.B. No fear: Financial irresponsibility: v. high costs.

H.W. Meant industry to carry cost. Will consider with Ministers concerned.

A.B. Incldg. me.

A.V.A. Scrap? More steam?

R.S.C. Special Cttee – getting more ships for scrap &amp; expeditg. cuttg. up.

A. Rlway Wagons. p.4. (p.2 para. 8. refers to improvemt., but this isn’t

reflected in table on p.4. Who is i/c?

R.S.C. Percy Mills. And they are workg. off back-log.

E.B. x/ Over 3 mos. since we discussed this à propos Rosyth: &amp; told not

one ship there yet.

A.V.A. 5 capital ships. Def. Cttee this week.

Agreed: R.S.C. to submit written report.

A.V.A. to tackle Admy. on x/.

A.B. Anthracite to Canada. Told output v. bad: worst part of coal-field.

Cd. we have report on ques. of output – believe we cd. get these

men to work better.

Agreed: R.S.C. to raise with M/F. &amp; P.

N.B. Tractors &amp; ploughs – cd. they be directed in early ’48 to areas needg.

them for spring-ploughing?

T.W. 25% being exported now: can’t do more w’out effect on home prodn.

N.B. But cd. we not send them early in year &amp; supply own needs later.

T.W. No: we want spring ploughing too.

H.W. Will review export plans. But imagine Australia = first priority need;

&amp; timing is different.

H.M. Govt. Publicity. At last Parly. Labour Party – one ques. raised

was keeping M.P.’s informed. Cd. Economic

Bulletin or something like it go to M.P.’s – not as W. Paper

because demand for debate.

May I consider this with R.S.C.?

P.M. Yes.

393

[Enter C.K. 4. Building Programme: Priority for Labour.

A.B. Discussed with R.S.C. Not much between us. Cd. I discuss with

R.S.C. and C.K.

Agreed.

[Exit C.K. Enter. G.S. &amp; N.

5. Civil Aviation: Tudor Aircraft Enquiry.

P.M. Not a good story.

Govt. will be put in awkward sitn if Rpt. issued w’out Govt. statemt.

want them ventilating.

Corpns – who wd. be purely “operators.”

N. Large demand for publn. From both Parties in H/C.

B.O.A.C. haven’t yet seen Rpt. Statement cdn’t be made w’out

consultg. them. Wd. take some time to develop policy on this.

G.S. Entitled to say we are considering Rpt.

H.M. Criticism a) Against B.O.A.C. b) Lack of leadership &amp; co-ordinn –

This affects Govt. M/S. launched this contract, &amp; shd. have

intervened to pull it together.

This Rpt. will be handle for criticism v. B.O.A.C., Dpts. and Govt.

Won’t catch it up.

Precedents for Govt. delaying publn. Xmas is near. Why not defer

publn until mid/Jan. or resumptn of Parlt?

R.S.C. Recommns shdn’t be thrown out w’out our considn. E.g. tht. Govt.

shd. make good deficit = &amp; hire. Both are new ideas: don’t

A.V.A. Rpt. needs editing also – references to competing types etc.

P.M. Any promise to publish?

G.S. No.

E.B. V. prejudicial to f. policy issues – prestige of Govt.

A.B. Clumsy &amp; distant way in wh. this machinery works.

Why could B.O.A.C. announce not going to use Tudors w’out

consultg. M/C.A.?

N. B.B.C. quoted from statement made by A.V. Roe.

A.B. Shd. Corpns be so free? Ministers shd. control them. If necessary we

shd. amend the Act?

E.B. Wd. prefer more direct Govt. control. Govt. to lease aircraft to 394

A.W. Much of this Rpt. for Govt. not H/C.

Shd. however make it clear soon (paras. 16 &amp; 18) tht. Tudor can do

its job.

G.S. We order aircraft as agents of Corpns. We are trying to sort out

diffies to wh. that leads.

P’ponement for a few weeks is possible – so tht. Dpts. &amp; B.O.A.C. can

consider. But we can’t suppress Rpt. altogether.

H.M. Rpt. to come on Tudor II in a month’s time.

J.S. Existg. relations betwn. Corpns &amp; manufacturers &amp; 2. Dpts. are not

satisf.

N. &amp; I. are considering &amp; may have to report to Cab.

x/ Agreed: H.M., R.S.C., H.W., N. &amp; G.S. to go into this &amp; submit

Govt. statement to be made on publn of this Rpt.

E.B. This shd. cover review of our C/Aviation policy.

N.B. And consider wtr. whole Rpt. shd. be publd.

P.M. Wider ques. are for S.I.M. Cttee.

A.B. M’while can Corpns be told not to make statements affectg. general

policy w’out consultg. Ministers?

H.M. Not so sure of that.

P.M. Ministers shd. at least be able to keep in touch with them.

A.W. B.O.A.C. discredit &amp; frustrate Cab. decisions.

E.B. Thro’ Critchley nominees? Fear this is so.

N.B. I confirm that.

N. The set-up is diff. from other socialised indies. Posn of Ministers is

v. awkward because independence of Corpns. Am inclined

to favour amending legn. Some indicns of resistance by B.O.A.C. sometimes. No evce of

hostility to Govt. by Corpn, or by employees.

R.S.C. More than Critchley gang. Real diffce of views. B.O.A.C. don’t

want to sacrifice their interests to B. aircraft manufacture.

That’s why they oppose B. Govt.

H.M. Shdn’t Ministers see Hartley?

A.W. B.O.A.C. don’t believe in Govt. policy.

395

A.B. They can’t be expected to. “how can we be judged by our

commercial results &amp; be requd to submit to non-comm.

obligns?” Only right course is to change obligns of Corpns &amp; Ministers

y/ by reply to P.Q. “Rpt. has bn. received &amp; is being considered.”

Agreed: x and y.

{Exit N. &amp; G.S.

{Enter J.S.

6. White Fish Industry.

H.M. Summarised history of conflict.

I conclude that M/Ag. wins.

Shd. have legn v. soon.

T.W. } Won’t add to my written memo.

J.S. }

P.M. Profits of trawler captains &amp; crews.

J.S. £5.000 p.a. for captains &amp; crews v. nicely thank you.

Industry is prosperous.

T.W. 770. m/water trawlers obsolete &amp; not being replaced.

P.M. But fear you will have deep-sea trade with its profits &amp; subside

others fr. Exchequer.

How will you prevent Bd. from being restrictive?

T.W. Not a producers’ Bd. Individuals = &amp; under control of Ministers.

P.M. Under the Ministers interested in producers not consumers.

T.W. Prices give distant trawlers excessive returns.

A. What wd. Bd. do?

H.W. Does a) mean restricted catching?

A.B. This Bd. wd. be a pressure group on Ministers.

J.S. Have ???? this by differential prices. Can go further in that if

necessary.

Believe in letting fish find own price, subject to maxima.

T.W. a) Space landings. b) Group trawler owners for catching &amp; processing.

Same problem as marginal land. M/Ag. has same attitude to it.

Oppose this propn as I did in L.P. Cttee.

Other methods available.

Why limit ourselves to natn or free competn. Examine ques. of State

bldg. up to date trawlers &amp; renting them. We needn’t operate

396

because we own.

Beware of the Corporate State.

A.W. If distant trawlers dominate you’ll lose valuable in-shore &amp; middle

of industry. I incline to M/F. views. This scheme doesn’t

Industry is now prosperous. And producg. the fish.

owners.

T.W. Remember Fishing Bill of ’33. Duncan Rpt. of ’38. All aimed at

b) Distant trawler will always catch more &amp; more cheaply. But

c) Fishmongers shop is out of date.

fishing grounds.

A.V.A. This is anomalous scheme. Producers Bd. will be persons ignorant

protect consumer.

Consider A.B.’s suggn of hiring trawlers to near &amp; middle trawling

same object as ours.

E.B. a) Can’t afford as a nation to lose inshore trawlers. R.N. reasons.

quality worse.

Can’t reject either memo. to-day.

Will be international troubles over [distant] fishing –

Russia may come into it &amp; prove efficient.

“I want both things done, from consumption end right back.”

H.W. M/Ag. memo. shows big move in right direction.

Wd. wish, however, to be satisfied on 1 or 2 points – outside Cab.

Fishing Conventions &amp; obligns to international trade. Restrictive

system needs thought from this angle.

Wd. prefer Development Council model.

R.S.C. Want these things done – but not by Producers Bd.

Let Ministers take powers to do what is needed.

Agreed: Group of Ministers to consider and pick the best

out of all suggestions.

J.S. Lucas Cttee favour Commodity Commn (for vegetables).

If 2 plans are to be married, this might be considered for fish.

N.B. Won’t avoid Distribution &amp; Marketing.

M/T. shd. be in the Group.

T.W. Leave Ag. Ministers &amp; M/F. out of it.

7. Council of Foreign Ministers.

E.B. This is going to break down.
