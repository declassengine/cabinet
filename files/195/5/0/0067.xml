2. Steel Priority System. H.H.M. Offl. Cttee satisfied tht. workg. of new steel scheme wd. be hampered

Hence compromise scheme, wh. must be judged as whole.

if any substantial amount of priority steel. But P.M.L. symbol

agric. and export.

Begin by increasg. priority steel, but taper it off until confined

Ministers concerned have agreed this in principle.

On draft statement comments by A.V.A. and M/S. which I have

accepted.

P.M. Why mention timber in para. 2? Agreed: restrict this to steel. Is it clear enough tht. importance is still attached to p’mmes? Shd.

as others.

Agreed

you not say, import saving &amp; exports are of equally importance

A.B. Any need to mention atomic energy in para. 1.

Anyhow, object to list. E.g. mention of transport – too wide.

Shd. be Govt. Motion: diff to put Whips on for Opposn Motion.

R.S.C. y/And omit also reference to “is a Star correspondent” – if you want

Motion agreed

Liaison Cttee have considered. M. Webb wants to pursue ques. of

newspapers’ action behind the scenes.

x/ Propose to add “all” the circs: and “relating to or assocd with”.

Ministers being on Cttee.

[Enter A.H.

Govt. Whips to be on.

5. Criminal Justice Bill: Capital Punishment. to keep Whip on, we cdn’t make these vote.

abolished for e.g. sheep stealing. Foreign countries –

C.E. Extremes not likely to be swayed by argument.

Hope we can arrange to settle by vote on Floor. Even if we tried

P.M. Govt. must advise on effects on law &amp; order.

C.E. Realm of prophecy. Effects foretold when death penalty to be

no evce of increase.

Don’t think a case has bn. made out tht. risks wd. be increased.

358

P.M. You must have a view as Minister i/c Bill.

C.E. I wd. say no suff. reason qua effects to vote v. abolition.

If Private Member I wd. vote for abolition.

P.M. Then what shd. Ministers do?

in crimes.

b) Norway &amp; Sweden can’t be cpd. with Glasgow or Ldn.

Only ques: what line shd. Cabinet take?

on timing of the change. Cd. keep clear of merits on basis tht.

state of public opinion.

v. small vote of H/C.

E.B. Trial &amp; error. Why not suspend for 5 years?

C.E. That is prob. what amendment will propose.

E.B. Don’t want suspension before 1950 because of post-war unsettlemt.

A.B. Why shdn’t H/C. express a view? Why shd. Govt. dragoon it?

Let C.E. put pros &amp; cons objectively. Ministers free: but not to speak.

A.W. Can we advise H/C. there is no risk in abolition.

C.E. No statistics to show tht. abolition in f. countries has led to increase

Traditional view of police &amp; “experts” has always bn. wrong.

A.W. a) Murder is peculiar.

Gangster crime. What of U.S.A.?

P.M. I assume a diffce of opinion in Cab.

A.B. Leave it free to Ministers – but Ministers not to take part in debate.

H.M. Diffy: criticism tht. Govt. shd. advise H/C. – either on merits or

this is no time to do it – because of post-war circs. &amp; unknown

Not imposs. then to allow free Vote. But Govt. wd. give some advice.

P.M. Responsibility of Govt. to the country – to give advice.

H.M. Must watch public opinion – not convinced tht. it wants this change.

A.W. Danger of too many abstentions. Wd. be grave if abolished by a

Shd. you do it now? Try it in a year’s time.

T.W. Free Vote. But ask C.E. to advise p’ponement for 2 years on grounds

of no mandate. [Genl. view against using mandate argument.]

Our concern is merely to avoid having this decided by H/C. in

a way which brings Govt. into disrepute.

359

G.T. Party angle. We are Govt. Tories will exploit differences in Cab.

abolish now. Recommend therefore “this is not the time.”

J. Support that view. Increase of violent crime.

Leave open the ques. of doing this in future.

R.S.C. I cdn’t vote in favour of prolonging it. Wd. want liberty to vote

Agree Ministers shdn’t speak.

A. Wdn’t H.M.’s line meet you? Govt. advice to p’pone.

Whips.

H.M. Consequentials – Colonies, Germany, mil. offences &amp; espionage.

A.B. That raises basis

Public opinion: have found no-one who thinks it right to

Home Secy. can do this by universal reprieve.

for abolition.

We shd. give that advice to H/C.

P.M. Govt. can advise H/C. to p’pone: but say we aren’t putting on

of objn. I don’t mind c.p. in more primitive

N.B. Rising standards re

civilisations. sanctity of human life. We haven’t now got that

Diff. to abolish in Colonies. Abolitionists in H/C. will want it

C.J. No demand for any change in law in Colonies.

taken w’out consent of Legve Councils.

But we shd. want death reserved for mil. offences.

rising standard. This therefore is not the time.

abolished there. Also Germany.

Ques. wd. arise only in limited no. of Colonies – for no action cd. be

Support point about social background.

Col. wd. have to be regarded as special case.

H. Strong Service view. Wd. involve some alteration – for civil offences.

Shinwell agrees. We press tht. this be kept a separate issue.

P.M. View: 10 : 5 in favour of “Time not opportune.” Give that advice. But allow free Vote of H/C.

Shd. they abstain from voting?

A.B. Must we sacrifice everything?

E.B. If I felt strongly I shd. claim right to vote.

Ministers shd. not speak against Govt. view.

R.S.C. Think we shd. have the right to vote.

360

H.M. Constitutionally wrong to register divided views. Abstention shd. be enough.

A.B. That is right. Was wrong to impose original decision on us.

C.E. Diff. to force junior Ministers to abstain.

C.E. I shall have to vote in acc. with my statement. That will be v. my

1932. } against.

A. Not a ques. of Party politics. No objn to Ministers voting freely.

Shd. have bn. happier to vote together. But in these circs. I believe

[Exit invitees save W.

But we can’t divide in diff. Lobbies.

R.S.C. Ministers must then be free to resign.

P.M. Labour Party have already given much latitude on matters of

conscience.

P.M. Are we prepared to drive Ministers out of office on an issue

like this?

G.A.I. Duty to constituents?

E.B. If H/C. has a free vote, why not Ministers.

conscience. Other Ministers who favour abolition will abstain &amp; it will be noticed. Is that any better than allowg. them to vote v. Govt. line.

A.B. Unity of Cab. isn’t really imperilled by dividing votes on this.

A.W. Why haven’t you objected to death sentences carried out since 1945?

J. Diff. to allow Ministers to vote v. the advice given by C.E. on behalf of Govt.

P.M. Precedent: 1931. Bill for Sunday opening. } Ministers voting

Divn in S. Entertainments Bills didn’t upset Cab. solidarity.

N.B. Junior Ministers wd. be in a hopeless posn.

A.V.A. Agree.

we shd. allow a vote.

A.V.A. Serv. Dpts. shd. consider effects on death penalty for mil. offences.

361

6. Savoy Hotel Strike.

obstruction of oil tankers. 19 men &amp; 4 women arrested.

Saw Lewis 7.25 p.m. Mon. Warned him tht. highway wd. be kept

C.E. Incident of Mon. night (2.15 a.m.). Lewis M.P. arrested –

Demonstrations threatened 18/11.

cleared – he went off &amp; did this.

May be efforts to demonstrate on day of R. Wedding.
