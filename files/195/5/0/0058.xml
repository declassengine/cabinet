C.M. 80(47). 14th October, 1947.

1. Marriage of Princess Elizabeth.

2. [Legislative Programme.

J. Salisbury has suggested wedding present from H/Lds.

P.M. No precedent. Don’t think it wise. Discourage it.

] Reform of House of Lords.

P.M. H/Lds. still under Parlt. Act, but time is passing. They mayn’t be so

it until they are troublesome.

period for wh. H/Lds. can hold legn up.

H.M. H/Lds. have behaved well. On what shall we found the indictment?

Even so, nervous about next 3 sessions. Wd. like therefore to clip

If we play it before they have given us cause, we play it

If we don’t have a Steel Bill this year, they cd. block it next. But

reasonable, esp. if bye-elections begin to go v. us. Can we leave

Shd. we introduce this Session the short Bill reducing to one year the

Our p’mme implied we wdn’t act unless they were tiresome.

their wings.

J. Ques. of political strategy. Timing of trump card.

too soon.

wd. they, bearing in mind the effects of such action at a Genl. Election.

R.S.C. It wd. re-open wide ques. of H/L. reform.

I advise waiting therefore.

Two stools {not emergency Bill because no emergency arisen.

{is this then our idea of full H/Lds. reform. this Session.

T.W. Relieve H/L. of headache and give it ourselves.

A.B. Back-ward boys mtg. last year ( ? ) considered we wd. have to do it

Case for doing this on merits anyway.

Parlt. is de facto a single Chamber. Make it so de ????.

Believe also it wd. be welcomed. “Revising” work cd. be better done

if element of challenge removed.

we have abandoned hope of any more natn measures in this Parlt.

Thus a good political substitute for Steel Bill.

If we don’t this Session draw H/L. teeth, our supporters will assume

Discipline in H/C. will then go.

315

R.S.C. Agree with that: but the simple Bill won’t fit that argument.

some time in wh. to consider legn. Say 6 months or end of

C.E. This ignores fact tht. we don’t know what they will do when their

Thus, support A.B. – save that I don’t want H/L. reformed.

They might use their power to force earlier Genl. Election.

Do it now, when no controversy has arisen with H/Lds.

Will have to Parlt. Act it thro’.

J. Acquiesced.

Situation envisaged in Face/Future hasn’t

When that Bill is passed, H/L. will be fully entitled to use it –

which they are now doubtful about it.

A.B. Can’t remove powers of H/L. altogether. They must therefore have

Session, whichever is longer.

power begins to be effective viz next year.

So I favour the short Bill.

P.M. Remember the backwoodsmen – out of Salisbury’s control.

Do it now, before we’ve lost a Bye-Election.

H.D. Do it this Session. Reduce period below one year. Don’t suggest

we believe in bi-cameral legislature anyhow.

Presume we can re-consider length of period.

A.V.A. Expedient? Look at 6 natn measures which H/L. have passed. arisen.

T.W. Then they deliver themselves to us – havg. taken the initiative against

on basis of quarrelling with H/Lds. If

Might then not be claim for Elections – no mandate for this.

Support J.’s view tht. this isn’t right tactical time.

R.S.C. After this Session we can’t Parlt. Act it thro’.

A.W. Steel people will give us long &amp; stiff fight. If you want Steel Bill

next year, you must clip H/L. wing this year.

us on steel, for wh. we have a mandate.

E.B. Introduce short Bill &amp; defend it with argument tht. you must be able

to pass legn in a Session – business-like approach. Don’t do it you want to do this, put

H.W. Support legn.

it fwd. on that ground.

N.B. Favour legn.

G.T. Support E.B.’s view.

316

L. Fear that if you re-affirm H/L. powers in this way they will use them.

Don’t think they wd. use existg. powers, even v. Steel Bill. If we are going to clip their wings, I wd. provide tht. their power to

A.V.A. Support that v. strongly.

{ M.G. Cttee to consider form of legislation.

amend shd. be conditional on H/C. consent.

A.W. Wd. encourage the Labour supporters.

J. But may upset moderate opinion, when there has bn. no provocation.

Agreed { Legislate this Session. P.M. to mention to the King.

3. Legislative Programme.

Estimated time for this p’mme = 82 days (as against 85 available).

And legn now unforeseen will inevitably occupy some time.

Thus, additions must be compensated by subtractions.

H.M. 95 days for legn – of which 10 now required for fresh Finance Bill.

Now H/Lds. Bill has to be added.

Strain on Members. Complaints to Whips from 50% of supporters.

But cd. be done by D.R. for a time.

H.M. Hope to get it through.

A.B. W’draw my pressure for Steel early, in view of decn re H/Lords. Dpt. But want early statement saying it is going on next Session

c) Agreed

G.S. Wd. be wrong to on with Steel Bill in view of adminve diffies of my

&amp; why not this. Cd. P.M. say it in Debate on Address?

P.M. Yes – in course of that Debate.

G.S. May I spk. in advance of King’s Speech to two sides of industry?

P.M. No: can’t anticipate K.’s Speech. postpone Motorways &amp; Milk.

J.S. Can Milk Bill be published? 317

P.M. Seek authy from Legn Cttee. [Exit Gaitskell.

J. Important because vol. system is drying up, as this Bill known

No legal aid in Co. Ct.

H.W. Long-term rather than short. Not crucial.

Accept “if time permits”. Agreed.
