C.M. 83(47). 30th October, 1947.

1. Illness of Minister of Transport. [Enter W.W.

P.M. N.B. to supervise M/T. L.P.S. to give a hand with C.R.O.

Minimum notice to Press.

2. Parliament.

H.M. Free vote on Rpts of Cttee Privileges re Allighan etc.

Business for next week.

promised to refer to Cabinet.

W.W. Vote (29/10) on abolition of Basic Petrol Ration.

Whips were on the doors: closure promised for midnight, but

Members seeped away &amp; some declined to vote v. the Prayer.

H.M. Must deal with this at Party Meeting.

E.B. Will there be same trouble over Engagement Order.

H.D. Supporters must face need for supporting unpopular decisions.

H.M. Pressure for Party mtg. to discuss financial posn. H.D. has met

Finance Group: he thinks it wd. be dangerous to meet Party on eve of Budget. Liaison Cttee are pressing for such a mtg. &amp; I

H.D. Have put reasoned diffies to Carol Johnston: said I shdn’t be able to say anything. Ready to have a mtg. with Party, but not on eve of Budget. Will speak to Party afterwards.

P.M. Quite clear this can’t be done immediately before Budget.

A.B. There will be Party mtg. next week - &amp; we can’t stop them talking

about finance.

They don’t want a statement by H.D. They want only opportunity of telling him their views.

P.M. H.D. is sufficiently in touch with Party views, by informal methods. Objn is to formal mtg. of Party – giving impression tht. Govt. are

takg. instructions from the Party.

A.V.A. Last point is specially serious in respect of Budget.

P.M. Current of views between Party &amp; Cabinet shd. be continuous.

Don’t therefore stress the formal mtgs.

Party shd. be asked not to discuss this on eve of Budget: &amp; if they

insist on doing so H.D. shd. not be there. 334

3. Parliament Act Amendment Bill.

H.M. Bill attached.

Parly. time-table – illustrative. Final decisions later, e.g. by F.L. Cttee.

J. Explained point of proviso.

H/L. powers re delegated legislation. Can’t insert that if we are to

keep to our time-table. Doubt if there is any substance in it.

Thought Cabinet shd. know.

H.M. Agreed – wd. lengthen the Bill. If Bill establd single Chamber govt. for delegated legisln wd. lend colour to criticism.

A.B. Memo. re delegated legisln shd. be circulated to Cabinet. Agreed.

“Nothing shd. be said to imply ….. Party favoured retention of

reformed H/Lds”

hereditary right to come &amp; vote. Believe we cd. get some

H/L. altogether.

C.E. Labour Party in 1911 moved for deletion of preamble words because

they favoured single Chamber Govt.

A. a) Orders: posn v. diff. now from 1911. Shan’t achieve our purpose

unless Bill does extend to subordinate legn.

b) Had wished other matters to be considered.

That is unrealistic. For introdn of this Bill does acquiesce in

continuance of H/L. with these abbreviated powers.

Shall be asked – is this all? Reduce to 6 mos? Single Chamber Govt? This Bill will commit us to H/L. as now constituted

with these limited powers.

I wd. like therefore to associate this with reform. Abolition of the

agreed solution on that. Cd. limit the right to issue writ of

summons.

Irish Cab. to consider memo. on this point before we go fwd. with

this Bill.

R.S.C. Don’t accept (b). Act of 1911 didn’t have this effect – cf. its

preamble.

This Bill doesn’t commit us even to refraining from abolishing

This Bill may provoke Lords to produce their schemes of reform.

Let initiative come from them.

We shdn’t make any suggn tht. we are ready to discuss with them means of makg. H/L. more sensible.

P.M. Support C.E.

Deny that this amendmt. implies acceptance of the institution.

A. That may be logical: but in fact inference will be drawn.

335

R.S.C. Enough to say – H/Lds. as now composed until altered.

P.M. All schemes of reform open to objn they leave Tory majority

in H/Lds.

Initiative must be left with H/Lds. on reform.

[Exit W.W.

Enter J.G.

4. Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Bill.

J. Proposal is not logical – a compromise. Justificn: benefits derive in

A.V.A.’s point.

But l.a.’s haven’t had chance of putting their views. The

when Bill is discussed. Shd. we appoint a Cttee to consider

J. Monckton Cttee was asked to consider only relations betwn. employer

&amp; workman. They also left Scottish posn open.

of this Bill.

in time for inclusion in this Bill.

part from insured person’s own contributions.

Informal assurance that T.U.C. will accept that.

Monckton Cttee were more logical.

J.G. Appears like giving some money to wrongdoer.

But otherwise we shd. be party to actions – might be driven even to

initiating action v. employers.

E.B. Approved societies did: for not everybody can belong to a T.U.

That course will not in future be open. Some citizens will

therefore be without help.

R.S.C. That is argument for Legal Aid Bill.

A.V.A. Satisfied that a services point can’t be met. But shd. be on record

that I raised it. (W.S.M. has a note of the point.)

H.D. Don’t see any means of meeting this – tho’ I sympathise with

Main point approved as in memo.

Statute of Limitations.

J. Varying periods 6 yrs – 1 yr. Monckton Cttee recommended 3 yrs.

extension may be serious for them. Shall be pressed on this

this from a wider angle – personnel to be agreed by me &amp;

L.P.

A.B. What wider angle?

If new Cttee reported in time, provision cd. be included in later stages

G.T. Favour a Cttee. But l.a. associations have in past bn. hotly opposed

to any extension. Don’t be optimistic about getting recommn 336

A.B. Agree: but pity it wasn’t done earlier. Agreed: Cttee to be appointed.

[Exit J.G.

5. Man Power: Registration of Street Traders.

H.M. As in memo. Arguments for action on spivs &amp; drones. Per contra

believe this is dynamite: street-traders are ticklish subject.

Strong feeling.

G.A.I. In T. Union circles.

Much noise &amp; sentiment over them. My view: leave it alone.

P.M. Cdn’t you cover street-traders in Genl. Order applying also to clubs &amp;

pools?

G.A.I. That is only alternative.

But why let drones regn be voluntary &amp; these compulsory.

E.B. Where?

Try to cover all who aren’t regular or in contract of service.

Must have a go at this. Tho’ won’t be much use when we get them.

Don’t want it said tht. we never even tried to cope with this?

R.S.C. Unfair to stigmatise street-traders as criminal class.

General order is preferable – tho’ not practical to enforce, doesn’t

matter because point itself is psychological, not practical.

C.E. W’out power of arrest, police wd. be in ridiculous posn.

Agreed: Reject separate order.

Insert in genl. Order &amp; bring to Legn Cttee.

[Enter R. Williams.

6. International Bill of Human Rights.

G.A.I. As in memo.

Don’t mind I.L.O. lookg. at it. But wd. prefer to come down on

Russia not in I.L.O. Shdn’t they be faced with resolution in forum

There are 8 areas where comp. labour in force.

E.B. Stand firm v. compulsory labour. Must assert the principle.

Want M/L. and F.O. to agree a statement to be made – justifying

present action on grds. this is still due to war.

this quick &amp; avoid prolonged wrangle.

where they are?

R.W. In formula, don’t use phrase “Col. territories”.

Words “exceptional condns ….” will cover our case.

337

R.S.C. I.L.O. have already discussed &amp; provided a let-out. No need to go

R.S.C. Prob. not. Anyway there is provision covering this in I.L. Convn.

there again.

C.E. Jury Service: aiding civil power if called on to do so.

Are these w’in “compulsory labour”.

N.B. Agree we shd. urge a formula &amp; get it adopted. But thereafter wise to refer it to I.L.O. (who are expert on this). It will come back later. Viz., reference for advice.

Dom. Govts. to be informed.

H.M. Is this realistic?

C/Engagemt. Order before H/C. We know we ought to do more.

Does anyone think this resolution will induce R. to behave.

This is humbug. Anyway, I deny as Socialist that State shd. have

no right to direct citizens.

Waste of time &amp; dollars.

N.B. I.L.O. Convns have reduced the evil of forced labour.

E.B. I don’t accept view tht. Socialist Govt. shd. direct citizens like

cattle.

Conditions in S. Africa 25 yrs. ago - &amp; what I.L.O. did to improve

that situation.

We are in econ. diffies to-day. But hope we shan’t always be.

I cdn’t support econ. doctrine which permanently depended

on direction of labour.

Influence of I.L. work even on our attitude to India &amp; Burma.

No objn to referring to I.L.O. for advice.

A.V.A. P. 3. para. a) Wd. like to be consulted on form of words.

E.B. “Human rights” provisions have bn. included in Peace Treaties.

Agreed: a) F.O. &amp; M/L. to discuss working.

repve be instructed to put up at once

[Exit R.Wms

P.M. Prefer the definition in Art. 2 of Forced Labour Convention ’37.

Want an international code v. which to check behaviour

under those provisions.

C.R.O. &amp; C.O. &amp; M/D. being brought

into consultation.

b) If they don’t like reference to I.L.O. our

our formula.

7. I.T.O. Geneva Conference.

Variation approved.
