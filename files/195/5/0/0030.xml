C.M. 30(47) 20th March 1947

1. Palestine.

C.J. As in memo.

P.M. What has bn. achieved by m. law.

T. will be tried.

F.J.B. No delay in carrying out d. sentences if imposed.

J. Has given impn. of weakness. M. law is flexible, wdn’t have bn.

w’drawl in total. 24 aren’t all terrorists : why didn’t you keep it up?

A.V.A. Shocked to find it w’drawn. Wdn’t it have bn. possible either a) to

restore economy in part by relaxed m. law. b) To get further assurance

of J. co-opn. I share J.’s views.

P.M. What next?

T.J. a) Given free hand in Army b) Enforced some co-opn. fr. J. community.

P.M. What has happened under a)

F.J.B. Picked up some important terrorists. Chastened J. popn: realise Govt. in earnest : effects of terrorism on them. Also got valuable informn.

P.M. Double-edged weapon : you’ve had to w’draw it. Terrorists will claim it as victory.

F.J.B. Can’t keep it on for long : only point is results from shock action. We wd. say it produces results : and shd. be used as necessary.

VC.I.G.S. Terrorist hide-outs limited in J. areas. Result of applying in law to those limited areas we collared 24 known terrorists – much larger than for some time.

R.S.C. Confusion betwn. m. law and precise measures taken under m. law. Was right to w’draw second : but mistake to have w’drawn m. law as such.

Will be more diff. to re-impose.

VC.I.G.S. Large nos. of troops and under gt. strain in cordoning off these areas.

Wd. be easier for us to have m. law over whole of Pal. and apply it moderately over most of the country.

C.J. Searches will continue : mil. will take such preventive measures as they can.

165

P.M. Terrorism is worse now. Indicates failure.

P.M. Not thought out by people on the spot.

C.A.S. In Arab revolt m. law was in force over whole country for a whole year.

P.M. Were C.A.S. informed that this wd. be temporary only?

C.A.S. No.

VC.I.G.S. Intentn. locally was always to keep it on only for so long as it produces results.

No signs of any plan for handling situation.

C.E. Tribute to B. troops. They deserve guidance.

VC.I.G.S. Local plan : re-impose m. law on areas where trouble centres.

P.M. That wd. be a farce.

H.D. Supported x/.

A.V.A. Get your plan first. C.O.S. shd. examine posn. and recommend a plan.

C.N.S. 4 escort vessels fr. Pac. to Med. to re-inforce.

Overcrowded ships : running ashore tactics increases risk of disaster.

R.S.C. Is perm. bldg. nec. in Cyprus. Summer only.

C.J. Mostly under canvas.

2. Military Mission in Greece.

Mc.N. Read Moscow tel. 176.

Army trained:

Agreed

C.O.S. discussed troops in Dec. and assumed Mission wd. continue. Cost £700.000. p.a. W.O. cd. discuss with Marshall wthr. U.S. wd. carry some of this.

Naval Mission : 72 all told : £35.000.

Police Mission : 66 officers £100.000 of which £35.000 is recoverable.

P.M. Follow to w’draw. Wasting what we have done.

H.D. 300 off : 1250 men = Army Mission.

Also Air Mission £16.000.

Total = £1 m. p.a.

P.M. Why not cut nos, down.

F.J.B. Gk. Army have B. equipment and Mission engaged mainly in training.

Can’t change to U.S. equipment in a moment.

P.M. For how long are we to m’tain these Missions?

VC.I.G.S. 2 years only recently at this strength.
