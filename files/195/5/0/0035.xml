C.M. 35(47) 3rd April 1947

1. Germany : Use of Liberty Ships.

J.B.H. German crews – as in memo.

Reconsider in 12 months.

H.D. Support J.B.H. Don’t run risk of worsening dollar posn. because remote

danger from use of G. seamen.

Also don’t let us make it more diff. for Congress to accept.

B. If dollars are to govern the decisions, let us at least insist on officers

being B. or U.S. not German.

H.D. British offrs., if available, but not U.S.

Mc.N. Can’t produce these objns. and sustain our dollar argument with U.S.

A.V.A. Re-affirm tht. G. shan’t acquire these ships.

Record view tht. this shdn’t be used to turn over large no. of seamen

and offrs. – viz., keep same crews.

A.B. Don’t however endanger our getting these ships.

Need for shipping for timber fr. U.S. and Canada.

P.M. German crews : not changing : B. officers if available.

No condition explicably v. para. 5. No need to recapitulate agreed

policy on all these points.

Approved. J.B.H.

[Exit J.B.H.

[Enter N. and N.B.

2. International Meteorological Organisation

Para. 5. unnecessary.

Let this plan be rejected by Americans, if at all.

W.J.E. Not G. crews, if poss.

Only light repairs in Germany.

.

N.B. E.B. is v. interested and urged me to put this in.

R.S.C. R. are keen on this.

H.D. 13 weather stations in Atlantic, of which we shd. spend £200.000 odd.

Mc.N. Permission message only to E.B.

Approved.

195

3. United Nations Organisations.

Mc.N. Report A.

Don’t want 2 Deputies, as suggd. by G.A.I. Want to urge single point of

need for a man on adminn. only. Don’t want to use this as balancing

appointmt.

G.A.I. Don’t press it.

N.B. Try for one. Keep other possibility in mind.

Report A approved.

Report C.

Mc.N. On Summary (B) stressed (vi). Priorities : security, econ.

rehabilitation. (v) and (vii).

C.J. C.O. not consulted. P.17 : (v). Pity if Caribbean and other Commns.

were merged in any specialised agency because latter don’t take

inhabitants into account.

Mc.N. x/. Will look into this point.

Substitute “co-operation” for “re-habilitation”.

A.V.A. y/. Put security and economic co-opn. first and equal.

A.B. Security won’t necessarily be secured by concentratg. on Security ques. May achieve a better climate for Security thro’ eg. U.N.E.S.C.O.

R.S.C. Also doubtful. Econ. agreement are more important than rehabilitation.

N.B. Don’t attach less importance to eg. Health Organisation.

Success on pol. front is essential : but neglect no chance of effective internatl. co-opn.

Report C. approved subject to x/ and y/.

Report B.

Mc.N. Ask Cab. to revise their concln. of 7.11.46 on I.T.O., W.H.O., and F.A.O.

R.S.C. But was a definite decision and we have taken public action on it internationally.

P.M. Prelimy. ques. is centralisation or not.

196

T.W. Against putting F.A.O. into N. York because cost, Europe more concerned with agric.

Mc.N. Not clear tht U.S. cost is highest : Geneva is only 10% lower than N. York.

Site for aggregn. of sp. agencies outside N. York : Geneva only starter.

P.M. International capital – in N. York? Do you want that.

Mc.N. Dispersal means proliferation of Secretariats, loss of contact inter re. divorce fr. U.N. Secretariat and Ec. and Social Council. Latter is designed to co-ordinate sp. agencies.

“City of internatl. civil servants” – this can’t apply in N. York anyway. Efficiency : ease of adminn. : economy – all point to centralisation.

R.S.C. I.T.O. Americans themselves agreed to Geneva because their pressure

groups.

Carried by large majority on the organisation. Canada want it and N.Z.

and A. support. Attempt to get it to H.Q. of U.N. was insisted by U.K.

Diff. Commonwealth repercussions if this were changed – especially

as U.S. efforts to capture c. aviation world over.

N.B. F.A.O. Budget wdn’t be in diffy. now if cd. have bn. sited with U.N. Because need to duplicate interpreters, library, stats. etc.

Cost of travel : delegates and secretaries must keep in touch with other agencies. Single agency in one town doesn’t make even that town international. A large aggregn. with special Press etc. community, will fertilise the whole world with internationalism.

U.N.E.S.C.O. experience already shows disadvantage of Paris.

T.W. F.A.O. people want to leave N. York [or ? Washington].

P.13 para. B. U.S. pressure groups dominate F.A.O. to extent tht. Europeans may even brk. away.

All on I.T.O. agree it wd. be fatal to have organn. in U.S., especially under Republican adminn.

P.I.C.A.O. Montreal. Def. Cttee June ’46 favoured Montreal.

G.T. J.P.R.M. opposes removal of U.N.E.S.C.O. to N. York.

A.B. Don’t believe consent. leads to economy.

Techn. organisations shd. be kept separate from political – otherwise best techn. people will keep out. Avoid domination by foreign politicians.

Already taken steps, with Cab. approval, to get W.H.O. to London.

A. Wheat Conference in Ldn. All agreed H.Q., of this organn. shd be in London.

P.M. Publicity : don’t always want it.

197

H.D. Financial argument in favour of consent. but outweighed by other considns. All v. Geneva. But wd. like as many as possible in other European capitals, incldg. London.

Reaffirm earlier Cab. decision : but try to get as many [Exit R.S.C.

H.D. Then must be in N. York.

N.B. Now believe U.S. pressure groups don’t matter at all – save prs. to U.S.

Delegations.

Separation of specialised agencies fr. E. &amp; Soc. Council will make it

impossible to operate internal. policy of full employment.

specialised agencies as possible to Ldn.

G.A.I. I.L.O. must be with Ec. &amp; Social Council.

P.M. If other agencies are not concentrated outside N. York, no tempt. for Ec. &amp; Soc. Council to have N. York and go to that centre. Report C

Agreed : Re-affirm decision of 7.11.46

Approve P.I.C.A.O. at Montreal.

Try to avoid Geneva.

.

G.T. Get intercept. Cattie to prevent overlapping from starting. [Agreed.

4. U.N.E.S.C.O. First General Conference. Tell Hurley about overlapping.

I.O.C. to consider overlapping.

I.O.C. to clear text of W. Paper.

5. National Service Bill

G.T. Authy. for W. Paper.

P.M. Will consult A.G. on that. Want to avoid Debate.

Might deal with it in speech on my Estimates.

.

A.V.A. Discussed with Def. Cttee. &amp; C.O.S.

May be amendment to reduce period to 9 months. Tories mightn’t

support us in defeating that.

Service Ministers and C.O.S., tho’ not considered it fully, believe

diffies. in reducing to 12 months wd. not be insuperable.

Better to take the initiative.

198

Points of difficulty – as in W.S.M.’s brief. Admiralty : Some degree of

flexibility requd. over sending conscripts overseas : R.A.F. can’t give

enough training in 12 mos. N.B. wd. prefer 18 months and more

deferments. I’m against that.

Agreed : Take initiative and propose 12 months. [Exit P.M.

W.J.E. Won’t get any officers out of 12 months’ training.

A.V.A. a) Ease it by not altering overall period of Service and Reserve. viz.,

increase period with Reserve.

H.D. Keep that in reserve.

A. If you do this, get credit for it. Put it down early.
