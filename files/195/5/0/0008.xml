C.M. 8(47) 16th January 1947 (9pm)

1. Road Transport Strike

G.A.I. Reported end of strike.

C.E. Shd. troops be used on Friday? Agreed : yes

Will Cab. express appreciation of work done by Troops? “ “

Will Service Dpts. reward the men?

N.B. 48 hrs extra leave.

A.V.A. Double 48 hrs. w’in a period. Agreed. No publicity for this.

G.A.I. Shall I meet T.U.C. on general ques. of unofficial strikes.

2. Economic Survey for 1947.

E.Sh. Two fundamental points – a) balance of payments and contingently b) man-power.

For internal situation we can adjust by taxation, subsidies, interest rates etc.

External posn. can’t be to import. Then we shd. analyse imports to see i) wthr. we can dispense with ii) curtail or iii) select them. Foreign investments help – but we have much less than formerly. Thus, problem : how to meet cost of imports (esp. from non sterling countries).

a) Defect in this memo : method of approach. Adverse b/payments posn. necessitates consn. of ques. wthr. we can afford to go on importing from hard currency countries. V. little reference here to agriculture. Only paras 47-48. But agric. is basic problem : because more you can produce here, less you import from abroad.

May be said you can’t produce more food here. But shd. think of this.

No matter how drastic the means may be.

Unless we do – faced with default on this loan and need for another.

P.M. What cd. you do on this in 1947?

E.Sh. You cd. start. 2-3 yrs. before loan expires : we cd. do somethg. in that time.

b) Man-power for Forces. Does this provide solution? And no way out in view of our commitments?

46

c) Women : won’t get them w’out compulsion.

H.D. That is what is proposed.

H.D. B/payments. On rocks in 1949. Hence para. 5. We recognise gravity of it.

Don’t agree internal sitn. can be adjusted so easily. Even if we had no external trade, we have ques. of too many people in certain occupations and not enough in others. Re-adjustment by fiscal means wdn’t be enough for that.

P.M. This is all estimating. Always short in labour force.

Productivity. Assumptn. here tht. all industries want specified numbers.

We can’t leave employers to say what labour they want.

No allocns. ¨no controls : gets employers free.

Problems involved in conscripting women.

Not merely external. Sterling balances will have to be settled.

None of these measures can be adopted w’out full explanns.

R.S.C. All Dpl. estimates include the assumptns. of increased productivity.

A.V.A. Some v. loose figures in Survey.

A.B. Much of this v. academic.

If you plan man-power, must do it year ahead. Distn. in ’47 determined by decns. in ’46. eg Housing. All houses to be built in ’47 are already under contract and can’t be changed.

We ought rather to be considering ’48.

Trying to cut now, when Dpts. have made p’mmes, is v. difficult.

Insufficient allowance for increased productivity.

Attitude re Forces wd. be unduly timid.

Women : can’t be implemented at once. Detailed scheme requd. Recruitment at 20 results in increased marriage rate.

636.000 gap : paper gap. Won’t close it by shifting figures because economy is not to this extent under control.

E.W. Pegged £1 : $ relationship : by agreement : then U.S. removes price control : £1 because undervalued, if no pegged exchange. Can one party thus affect others’ debt.

H.D. Loan agreemt. included no agreemt. by either of us about our internal economy.

Nor would we have cared to see such included.

May be a drop in U.S. prices. Immediate advantage to us. But not if associated with depression.

A. Not alarmed at gap.

47

Possibilities - a) increased productivity. Machinery : incentives etc.

With 20½ m. in emplt. increased efficiency cd. close gap.

b) distribution and use of labour. Multitudes employed in non production occupns. More use of funds labour.

T.W. Whatever margin of error, clear there is a big gap.

We must take every step we can to re-shuffle our man-power.

Not quite enough attentn. paid to agriculture. True its long-term.

Reference to wasting p.o.w. force, but no suggns. for replacing them.

We shall be 60.000 short in 1948. What do we pay for dried eggs?

Want to restore own livestock. When foodstuffs available, and if we get man-power, we can do so.

Houses in rural districts. What we want is more for farm workers.

Reservd. for miners. Agric. is as important as mining.

C.E. Then you will get claims fr. other industries, seriatim.

A.G. On b/payments I support R.S.C. not E.Sh.

Manpower. Ques. not of nos. but productivity. These figures must have bn. produced on basis of a direct relation betwn. nos. and output. But o.p.m. is real issue. cf. experience in coal mining. Problem new motives and incentives : can’t be exptd. in figures. 630.000 means nothing.

2.3% of populn. only. Small percentage increase in output wd. make all the difference.

R.S.C. Manpower budgeting – as in war – based on experience and forecast of output and related to practical, not optimum programmes.

Say no estimates are good : give up planning.

Gap will be filled – but, w’out our influence by random shortages.

What better estimates than by Dpts. responsible.

A.V.A. No objn. to system so long as estimates not made basis for rigid allocns.

Figures in report are out of date. Other economies already made.

Anyway even 630.000 = 2.3%.

Beware of feeding inefficiency and known antipathy of employers.

Inefficiency of motor industry – too many types etc. cpd. with U.S.A. What response from cotton?

R.S.C. From employers but not T.U.’s. May defeat economy and own p’mme by feeding man-power to inefficient industry.

1946 : gap smaller.

Footnote on p.4. of Survey applies to many industries.

48

P.M. Mustn’t assume labour is being used properly. War experience.

J. 46 m. popn. to be sustained. Under emphasis on agric. shows w’ve lost sight of this. Wd. bring us down to 15 m. Our only chance : processing raw materials and exporting finished goods. The more we rely on U.S. the worse off we are because they have prodn. as good as ours. Shd. look to other sources for raw materials.

Vital need : put this over so tht. need for greater productivity is understood.

G.T. Don’t lose sight of inter-relations of these ques. When eg. cotton wants to increase productivity can’t because of shortages elsewhere. This vital point is faced in this memo. Must sink Dpt. interests and pick out the things which are basic. All dependent on coal.

G.A.I. N.J. Ind. Council addressed by 3 Ministers on productivity. Memo produced &amp; about to issue. Council will put it over.

J.S. Estimate fallible. But obvious to the eye tht. economy is overburdened.

Shdn’t avoid issues, however drastic, on grd. tht. estimates not exact. Need for economies in manpower is obvious to the naked eye.

P.M. Keep balanced mind. Manpower is short. But don’t lets have May Rpt. or Geddes Axe.

P. Over 1 m. more available than before war. Tho’ 700.000 more regud. for export. then is still a plus.

a) School leaving Age.

E.W. Are we to fill a 2.3% gap from school children.

No educational argument wh. we cd. sustain in H/C. Means depriving of one year’s educn. 156.000 children who suffered most from lack of educn. during war.

And working class children.

Psychol. point. We are ready now. Because of determination, co-opn. of M/W. and fact of a date line. Date has bn. all important for l.a.’s. They at first were sceptical (Fisher Act) : but I pledged honour of this Govt.

I said date will stand. That is why we are ready now. If we now p’pose any future attempt to get anything done by a date will break down. We shd. have courage to tell our supporters they can’t have social reforms they ask for and also a 40 hour week.

P.M. Horrified at this. We gave v. definite pledges. Plenty of time to think. Can’t now defer ¼ date on 20/1.

Remember May Rpt. this is typical May Rpt. proposal. Hits suffering group for little benefit.

49

We must rely on education for increased output.

A.B. And those parents who are willing to keep children at school will be able to do so.

This will hit those worst off.

Many of these uneducated children useless to industry.

J.W. Para. 21. My memo. was not askg. for p’ponemt. but for special priorities to enable me to make the date. I will carry on and face my diffies.

C.E. Argument of M/D v. cogent. Various discns. of use of children in industry : our way of compelling efficiency in industry is to w’draw this reservoir of cheap labour.

N.B. Must think beyond current year. Loss from this in last 2 yrs. wd. more than outweigh gain in first.

A.G. Shocked by this recommn.

H.McN. E.B. hopes Cab. won’t accept this recommn.

H.D. Clear that Cab. don’t like this. Nor did we. Liked it least of all.

Don’t press this recommn. against Cab. view. But if this is w’drawn Cab. must be kinder to other recommns. (Applause.

A.W. Year lost after leavg. school before apprenticeship. M/L. was to consider bringing appr. age down. That wd. help this shortfall.

G.A.I. Many industries considering this – many have acted. Mainly, however, alteration in lengths of apprenticeship.

Will submit report to Cabinet.

A.W. Incldg. age of entry.

G.T. Raising age to 15 will solve most of this.

b) Employment of Women.

R.S.C. Explained proposal.

P.M. What condns. are they to accept eg. cotton.

G.A.I. Cdn’t put them into industries where no guaranteed condns. etc.

Unlikely that many will have to be directed away from home.

A.B. Why 20. Marriage.

G.A.I. Same age as for mil. service. Shd. be equivalent to that.

50

G.T. In war didn’t direct women until we directed men of 50.

This is v. drastic. Cd. be argued this = geographical conscriptn. of women.

Eg. cotton : wd. be regarded as penalty.

In war we tried part-time emplt. of women first. And direction of women gave no more trouble than anything else in way.

G.A.I. New factor – adoption of 5 day wk. has made industrial emplt. more popular for m. women.

H.McN. E.B. is against this – industrial dirn. of v. drastic kind, not comparable to mid service. Don’t know what propn. wd. be directed away from home. Surplus wd. be found in areas of heavy industries. M/L. wd. have to make arrangements for housing allowances etc.

Direction into nursing wd. cause gt. trouble.

Further examn. and details requd. before we decide.

E.W. Women wd. accept equality of sacrifices – but only in climate of sacrifice.

If we accepted in principle and it leaked – rumpus.

Cd. be done only by revival of “national” feeling.

P.M. Are large nos. not working who might be?

R.S.C. Yes.

P.M. Or mainly to alter distribution?

R.S.C. Yes, also.

P.M. Why shd. these, not other women already in useful work be directed?

R.S.C. Because boys of same age are being conscripted for mil. service.

P.L. What value in service for 2 years in eg. nursing?

R.S.C. Much, in cotton. And many wd. stay on.

A. Cdn’t this be used to reduce requirements of Forces for men?

Some occupns. cd. be made more attractive eg W.L.A. – w’out compulsion.

R.S.C. Conscriptn. to Forces wd. be a minus because a) wd. take women out of industry and b) wd give no power to distribute acc. to need.

P.M. If it’s direction why limit it to women of certain age.

E.Sh. Why not conscript to Forces and then give right of option to go elsewhere.

51

P.M. Too many will opt for Forces.

C.J. Other expedients – economy in women power : other sources.

Foreign labour, for example.

Climate of opinion. Can’t do in peace what you did in war. Wd. be an outcry from mothers – who are sick enough about the boys. They were reluctant even in war. Unpopular especially in Labour areas.

R.S.C. M/L have considered all other possibilities.

N.B. Foreign labour (women) doing well in cotton. Cd. we bring in foreign women?

G.A.I. We are concentratg. on hospital dom. service.

C.E. Gt. social difficulties.

Agreed : Consider and bring up report. (M.E.P. Cttee).
