C.C. (65) 17 18 March 1965 10 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral) [Enter Ch. Whip.

L.P. As in statement.

2. Oversea Affairs (oral).

a) Viet-Nam.

F.S. Soviet reply to our message of 20 Feb. proposed co-Chmn to issue statement wh. is merely denunciation of U.S. I have told Gromyko not function of co-Chmn to be controversial: and, if we condemn U.S., must condemn N.V-N. too. G. denied N.V-N. helping V. Cong. S.U. will publish: so must we (?P.Q.). But time taken to reply shows that they took our proposal seriously but were pressurised against it by China etc. I will explore further with U.S. – if they have assured cessation of attacks, wd. they withdraw (as Stevenson said): and wd. they make some public refce. to a confce? U.S. must recognise S.U. will not criticise China and will continue to insist U.S. must withdraw before any discussns.

b) Germany and Middle East.

F.S. G. has now established dip. relns with Israel. Some Arabs are breaking off relns with W.G. but not recognising E.G. Others doing both. This polarisation of West/Arabs a pity. Israel may gain: and Nasser may suffer as result of pushing Arabs more than they like. Our own dialogue with Nasser must slow down: no Minl visit at Easter. I will tell U.A.R., basing myself solely on Aden, that visit must be deferred a bit.

P.M. Clear condemnation of Hallstein doctrine.

On V-N. deadlock on point of prior cessation of attacks before discussions. But U.S. may be prepared to see us take a unilateral co-chairman action. And they shd. exploit sitn in which S.U. must resent Chinese pressure.

M.O.D. Cab. shd. discuss whole posn in foreign affairs; e.g. S.U. are opposed to A.N.F. Therefore stocktaking on foreign policy v. desirable.

P.M. Maybe: after F.S.‟s visit to Washington. E.E.C./E.F.T.A. links desirable: but no qun of reopening U.K. entry into E.E.C. – only of strengthening E.F.T.A. cohesion.

3. Iron and Steel Nationalisation C.(65) 39 and 42. [Enter A.G.

P.M. Ch. Exch.‟s Cttee. has worked hard: time for decision. Must settle politics first.

P.M. W. Paper round about Easter: to be followed by Bill to be enacted during rest of (prolonged?) Session. Now discuss content of W.P.

Ch. Exch. As in memm. Decision on compensn shd. be left on one side.

Unscrambling of B.I.S.F. v. difficult. Therefore proceed as proposed.

M.P. Have followed ‟49 Bill, wherever possible. But have avoided trying to determine structure at outset – have allowed 12 months after enactment for this.

Must elide B.I.S.F. hybridity: can do so by our means, wh. take over 90% of industry and enable us to require informn. If B.I.S.F. oppose this, our right to legislate at that point (i.e. subsequent hybrid Bill) is clear.

May have to have power to prevent devts. above a certain size in private sector. Also provision to encourage exports.

Bill essentially a planning instrument.

A.G. Little risk of hybridity on this basis. Subject to Speaker, authorities of H/C. agree.

M. Tech. On this basis I accept hyby argt. But second Bill essential; otherwise B.I.S.F. will thwart us.

P.M. I agree: depends on our (future) majority in Parlt.

F. S/S. a) Can we withdraw “our” companies from B.I.S.F? b) And compel directors to sever connections and become “our” employees?

M.P. a) No. b) No.

F. S/S. Then nothing will change for at least a year.

Ch. Exch. I agree. Remedy is strong Corporn.

M.P. Yes: but even Corporn can‟t break B.I.S.F.‟s hold without further legn. Remedy is in re-organising industry in larger units wh. can‟t be denationalised (cf R. &amp; B.). At that point B.I.S.F. loses its raison d‟etre.

M.H.L.G. But if second hybrid Bill is necy anyhow, what do we gain by initial limited Bill?

M.P. We get biggest assets: and we get powers to acquire inforn. Second Bill may be necy: but only if B.I.S.F. are recalcitrant. And meanwhile we can begin to rationalise industry, investt progm etc; and this will put pressure on B.I.S.C. (Ore) and B.I.S.F.

P.M. But what about powers to direct Corporn to manage cos. in certain ways? This shd. be examined.

M. Tech. And private cos. will be able to secure, via conferences &amp; Council, their own people, in personal capacity, on executive.

Ch. Exch. Yes, they can fight if they want to. But they may not want to.

M.H.L.G. How do we defend ourselves against charge of half-hearted measure?

M.P. Base it on hybridity.

A.G. And add assumption B.I.S.F. won‟t challenge us.

P.M. Ch. Exch.‟s Cttee. shd. examine presentn in W.P. I will consider timing, particularly qua compensn, with Ch. Exch. &amp; M.P. Otherwise approve.

4. Rent Bill. C.(65) 45 &amp; 46.

M.H.L.G. Publish Bill next week. W.P. clear but difficult to correlate with complex Bill.

Provision on agricl tied cottages is as good as we can get.

Amdts. to para. 22, 25 &amp; 27.

P.M. Bill does not provide for “fixing” of elecy meters etc. Covered by Elecy Act: but shd. emphasise in debate.

Ch. Duchy. Para. 25 discloses penalties for first time. They are stiff: but H.O. content.

Para 27 unrevised cd. be linked with para. 8. This Bill does not create any more houses to let: it won‟t help our housing policy – may hinder it by consolidating existing tenancies. Bill is necy: but revised para.27 shd. emphasise our measures to increase houses to rent.

M.H.L.G. Will amend to make clear.

F.S. Will harassment deal with harassment by neglect?

M.H.L.G. Probably: but wd. depend on degree &amp; proof of intention.

F.S. Diplomats worried about rents for fixed terms.

M.H.L.G. We have gone further to protect them – with soldiers &amp; landladies - than I really like. Proper contract for terminal letting is their real remedy.

P.M. Pity we can‟t prevent bad landlord from continuing – e.g. like keeping an animal after maltreatment.

M.H.L.G. I will consider (qua individuals if not companies) for possible amdt. in Cttee.

Will amend para. 26 to emphasise two things – amdt &amp; clarificn of law.

F.S. Issue a child‟s guide: and a simplified version of M-H. Report.

P.M. Consider.
