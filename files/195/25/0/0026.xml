C.C. (65) 32 3 June 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip.

L.P. As in Statement for first week after Whitsun.

10 minute Rule Motion on Abortion. If opposed, free vote – like Wolfenden! Agreed.

2. Economic Policy (oral).

P.M. Redn in B.R. desirable – economically &amp; politically – as means of “break out”, to arrest stiffening of mortgage rates &amp; ease shortage of their resources (wh. must otherwise be remedied by Exch.). 1% better than ½%. Also a crisis rate, wh. must be reduced now – or not at all this year. Do it now when reserves have just risen.

Also 7% a v. heavy burden on Exch (and on B/P).

Governor of B/E. marginally in favour, (tho‟ stresses risk involved) provided some parallel tightening of credit for H.P. Complements easing of price control (B.R.) by closing loophole in quantitative control, wh. remains – in form of finance companies – after joint stock banks have accepted 5% limitation.

One way – 36 to 30 months for cars. Governor thinks insufficient: therefore consider deposit increase from 20% to 25% and 10% to 15%. Little effect on cars (since purchases financed largely by trade in); but more on household durables – tho‟ not services and shd. be offset by easing of interest rates. No risk of depression in these industries: perhaps slight incentive to exports. Cookers &amp; water heaters remain untouched; furniture &amp; bedding remain at existing rates.

Must be a package – either neither or both. Latter best – beginning of an easement wh. shd. be economically &amp; politically advantageous.

Ch. Exch. Risk v. considerable. All Tsy. advice against it. B/E, however, think that, having waited for I.M.F. loan, must now seize this last opportunity. If goes wrong, £ in grave jeopardy. But since B/E. will take risk, go ahead. But must appear sign of confidence, not bravado.

H.P. necessary condition, if principle of 5% limit on growth of credit to be comprehensive. One finance company (Anglo Auto) has already raised H.P. deposit to 25%.

S/S. E.S. i) Reduction in B.R. v. odd after bad £ weak.

ii) We have always criticised H.P. as too narrowly based: why do it now?

iii) What is real link between B.R. &amp; H.P. other than political gimmickry?

Ch. Exch. Only confidence requires B.R. at 7%: to keep it too long is counterproductive, as showing lack of confidence. Therefore have wanted to reduce as soon as reserves permit.

H.P. largely presentational – but intl opinion insists!

Link is as P.M. says – need to complete quantve control of credit which, when comprehensive, permits redn in cost.

M.H.L.G. If an exercise in confidence, presentn vital. Ch. Exch.‟s thesis not convincing.

Ch. Exch. Govr will do this convincingly. Relief to Exch. is £25m: offset by increase in cost of car, wh. shd. be reduced by fall in interest rates.

F. S/S. I oppose increase in deposit. Tho‟ less serious than cut in period, will fall heavily on car industry, wh. is already beginning to turn down? Therefore do B.R. alone, wh. I wholly favour. Combination will be gimmickery, since public opinion will see adjusted to have minimum practical effect. Even so, B/E. are slowly pushing us, step by step, towards deflation and unempt – as our predecessors went! If B.R. has to be raised again in autumn, it will aggravate this process.

P.B.T. On balance I favour package deal – price worth paying to get greater manoeuvre on B.R. H.P. only a small restraint on domestic demand (wh. can easily be reversed, if necy) but can be made convincing to intl opinion.

Ch. Duchy Our philosophy permits us to reduce monetary control if we are satisfied that discriminatory physical controls (wh. are preferable) are adequate.

S/S. D. But how reconcile little impact at home with reinforcement of confidence abroad?

P.M. Only need to show no real loosening of control.

L.P.S. I favour package: but, if it goes wrong……?

Ch. Exch. We could act: but chances of going wrong are significant.

M. Techy I oppose it – as false. Either H.P. is effective or not. If it is, will aggravate recession in car industry, wh. is already apparent. If not, no time for altve remedies – we shd. have to go to 8% B.R.

L.P. I favour package. Essential to get B.R. down. H.P. will have little effect: and, if car recession coming, must deal with it by P.Tax etc.

S/S. S. I favour package – for sake of advantage of cut in B.R. qua local authorities etc.

F.S. Intl opinion will expect confidence to be reflected in further cut in import surcharge.

Ch. Exch. But 6% B.R. will still be v. high.

C.S. I favour package – for sake of intl confidence in £.

M.P. I too – for sake of benefit to prodn.

L. Ch. I too – for Ch. Duchy‟s reasons.

M.T. I too. H.P. effect will not be serious.

M.O.D. Confidence will depend on trade futures. And beware of seeming to act in panic as result of political weakness &amp; unpopularity.

M.A.F.F. I favour.

Col. Sec. I too, reluctantly.

S/S. W. I too.

S/S. E.S. I oppose – on grounds of bad timing in relation to present £ rate.

M.H.L.G. I favour.

F.S. I too.

P.M. Majority in favour. Therefore accept package deal, with reservations by some Ministers.

? Best to present, by Ch. Exch, in single statement in H/C. to-day.

Ch. Exch. V. reluctant.

M.H.L.G. Must present as single operation, in spirit of confidence &amp; certainty.

P.M. Ch. Exch. to make statement. [Exit Ch. Exch.

3. Oversea Affairs (oral).

a) Dominican Republic.

F.S. Sitn quieter, but unresolved. U.S. forces being reduced and O.A.S. units arriving. Cease fire prolonged indefinitely. U.S. now reject Imbert and favour Caomavo. Some hope of new &amp; acceptable Govt. emerging; but will take time. Avoid Parly statement, if possible.

b) Cambodia &amp; V-Nam.

F.S. Will announce to-day W. Paper showing readiness to join S.U. in convening confce. on Cambodia in accordance with wishes of C. Govt. They have suggested Great Powers shd. choose repves of V-Nam. Must leave to Govts. of N. &amp; S. V-nam. China may refuse to attend.

On V-N. can only say reconvening of 1954 Confce. is soln, and that, despite S.U. refusal to do so, we are ready to examine any other ways of convening confce. – by consultation with other members of C‟w. if possible. Confce. shd. be followed by ceasefire and neutralisation of V-N., leaving peoples of N. &amp; S. V-N. to work out relationship and programme of ec. assistance to go ahead.

P.M. Shd. precede Ch. Exch.‟s statement on B.R. etc.

[Enter M.P.N.I: M.P.B.W: M. Avn

4. Computers for Govt. Departments C.(65) 78, 79, 80.

F. S/S. As in C(65) 78.

M. Techy Are we having a computer policy – or not?

I.B.M. are not mftg. in Scotland: many components are being imported. Therefore must favour U.K. prodn if my job is to make sense.

M.P.B.W. Five months delay cd. be reduced, by emergency action, to six weeks. Installation possible by second half of May. How much does readiness by 1 April matter? I.B.M. cd. make this date, qua building, only by v. strenuous efforts.

F. S/S. Doubt whether six weeks practicable. And cost &amp; capacity comparison and running costs comparison still favour I.B.M.

M. Techy Capacity comparison meaningless: no prospect of more work in Scotland than E.E.L. can cope with.

S/S. S. But it was E.E.L. machine wh. was discarded at the outset, as least satisfactory on every ground – cost, capacity, performance etc.

Redn in delay means a rushed, and risky job. And programming of E.E.C. requires 53 people, of whom E.E.C. will provide only 14 (at extra cost). Another delay – to get balance of (v. scarce) personnel.

Capacity is important – over 7/10 years, during which extra work will emerge.

M. Techy Can‟t separate Scottish case from basic policy. I.B.M. should not be treated as a Br. firm – wh. it isn‟t. Decision in favour of I.B.M. therefore means basing our computer industry on foreign, not British, enterprise.

F. S/S. But that means promoting U.K. mergers and making U.K. industry more competitive. M. Techy‟s policy wd. frustrate both.

P.B.T. Can‟t define Br. indy by refce. to nationality of shareholders. Br. industry means industry producing in Britain – particularly in devt areas, which we must not stunt.

May be right to give prefce to Br. industry: but public announcement of 25% margin unwise in context of our intl commercial policy. Cd. only defend to E.F.T.A. by v. weak argument about a unique case.

Therefore best to give some preference quietly but avoid public declaration.

C.S. Tho‟ support S/S. S. on that issue, M. Techy right on basic issue – wh. we shd. explore at C.P.M. Delay any announcement until after that.

P.M. Remember extent to wh. imports of sophisticated mfd goods contributed to last year‟s B/P. strain. Must try to redress this – but primarily by refce. to extent to wh. R &amp; D. are done in U.K. and/or components are imported.

Can‟t concede monopoly to U.S. (cf. France).

Must establish centralised Govt. buying for future purchases of computers; and concede some margin of prefce (? rather less than 25%) if adequate cost control, standardisation etc. But no public announcement.

F. S/S. This is entirely acceptable – sensible policy of import substitution.

M.O.D. Yes: but different from unacceptable B/T. policy of laissez faire.

P.M. P.B.T.‟s proposal goes beyond his memm.

S/S. S. Even so, don‟t impede contribn of I.B.M., Honeywell etc. to Scottish devt areas. They don‟t import so many more components than I.C.I. etc.

P.M. Let facts on this be established.

Meanwhile accept principle of M. Techy‟s memm: but:-

a) 25% high. Therefore establish overall Govt. user requirement over forward period and then negotiate min. prefce wh. Br. industry wd. need to compete &amp; become thriving in this period. Memm on this subject for Cab. – dealing with subsidy as possible altve to preference at less than 25%. No public announcement till thereafter.

M. Techy Period of “probation” shd. not be more than 3 years.

M. Avn R.A.E. computer still unsettled. Go to tender on widest basis and consider results.

P.M. Yes: but, unless margin v. great, order shd. go to a U.K. firm. Open tenders will provide useful standard of reference in deciding reasonable margin of preference in future. [Exit M.O.D.

Any evidence of dumping in I.B.M. tenders?

M. Techy Can‟t get it. But in U.S. market, they have built-in 50% preference.

P.M. Even so, we have sold one Atlas to U.S.

M. Techy But only by D. of Defence, as comparative test with U.S. products. Depts. must give us detailed list of forward requirements – on basis of which we cd. discuss with 3 groups of producers separately.

P.M. Agree. Scottish case over the dam. Otherwise, as I have said.

M.P.N.I. Does arrangement proposed safeguard us against breakdown? And does one year‟s delay include testing period etc?

M. Techy On breakdown – yes. On time-lag, yes: it is delay in project wh. is test.

5. Future Government Business (oral).

P.M. Pending plethora of White Papers. L.P. to rationalise with Ministers concerned.

L.P. W.P.‟s can be published in Recess, provided not unduly contentious.

[The remainder of the discussion was political;

and the Secretariat withdrew.]
