C.C. (65) 9. 11th February 1965. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip.

L.P. As in Statement.

2. Oversea Affairs (oral). [Enter M/S.F.O.

a) Viet-Nam.

P.M. F.S. in Brussels. But I have been in personal touch with U.S. Prest. We must remain ready, as co-chairman to use good offices at right moment. That is not yet: but our views are now fully known in W‟ton. and U.S. Govt. may reach point when they wd. welcome our help.

[Exit M/S. F.O.

3. Housing Programme. C(65) 17 &amp; 21. [Enter M.P.B.W:

Ch. Secy Tsy

M.H.L.G. Public sector programme cut back under Tories. Must therefore start now to encourage L.A.‟s to build houses for rent not only for limited purposes (e.g. o‟crowding) but also for general purposes as essential complement to Rent Act.

Tories, having cut back, let go shortly before election. That raises basic standard for us. We can just maintain it – provided we use indd methods and hold back private housing. Link between rate of building &amp; mortgage rents.

Ch. Exch. Can‟t accept. Already easing mortgage arrangements – wh. will provoke increased demand in private sector. But no complete picture – wh. we must have before allowing L.A.‟s more approvals than they were allowed last year. 1962 – 106,000: then 123,000: then 144,000 in 1964. Maybe only redressed ill balance before. To increase this, as now proposed, not feasible – unless we overstrain economy, as inherited plans of Tories wd. have done.

And mustn‟t anticipate, by pre-emption, July review, when know private

s. p‟mme. Therefore keep to 144,000 till July and then reconsider – particularly since L.A.‟s will take this decision as indicn of possibilities over wider front of schools, hospitals etc. This wd. increase already obvious inflaty pressure. And effect on intl opinion? Effect of our decision on P.W.L.B. qum has already provoked adverse comment from some of those who are financing us. £ technically strong at present: but B/P. in serious prospective deficit.

P.M. But mustn‟t betray principles of Labour programme because of foreign pressure. That raises v. basic issues.

Will release of resources from curtailment of office bldg. help?

S/S. W. I support M.H.L.G. Welsh L.A.‟s under great pressure: we must help them. Consortia of L.A.‟s increasing: and use of indd methods. This wd. help.

F. S/S. I support M.H.L.G. – for social &amp; political reasons. Bldg. indy admittedly under general pressure: but not equally in all regions. That gives some chance of selective increases. And new methods will increase this margin – provided we promote Govt-industry partnership. We must produce new demand in order to elicit additional resources. Therefore we could meet M.H.L.G.‟s target without further overheating industry provided whole of

increase is met by indd methods and a plan for prodn and transport of prefabricated units is prepared. And must be done on selective regional basis – wh. wd. have political advantages too.

L. Ch. Must get economy right first – to that extent support Ch. Exch. Subject to this get priorities right – and housing is v. high, socially, economically and politically. Must be ready to reduce other items, if necessary; but housing proposals won‟t offset sitn for 2 years. Therefore support M.H.L.G.

Ch. Duchy. Another attempt at pre-emption. Unfair to Ch. Exch. But, if so, we must be clear that there must be a programme pause and when it will end.

M.P.B.W. I support M.H.L.G. – for sake of modn, wh. must be encouraged. M.H.L.G. are now trying to use N.B.A: and indd methods could eventually produce components for another 55,000 houses a year. The industry needs to be stretched: and 20,000 system built houses (if not more) could be built this year.

Private h‟bldg. is rising: and public sector h‟bldg. must keep in balance. V. important electorally.

M. Tech. I support M.H.L.G. Surplus aircraft designers etc. wd. transfer to system-built design work as offering safer future. Must boost techy, politically.

H.S. I have strong claims for police and prisons: but I am alarmed by Ch. Exch. and I support him.

M.H.L.G. But great scope for switching capacity in selective districts to fabrication of custom built houses, in substitution for present imports of such units.

F. S/S. And there is an export market for them – wh. Shorts might exploit.

S/S. S. I‟ve been trying to work within approved allocn. M.H.L.G.‟s proposals wd. put me under renewed pressure.

S/S. E.S. Long-term programme in July. But for immediate future economy is overloaded: watch effect on Budget and political impact of that.

And must resist further pre-emption: otherwise I – and other spending Ministers – have claims of our own.

M.T. Need for housing is ex hyp. greatest in areas to wh. labour is moving. Nonsense to put more prodn there.

And no more pre-emption. Wait for July – no constrn will be delayed.

I support Ch. Exch.

F. S/S. Can‟t leave it till July. Watch L.A. elections in May.

M.T. But total figures won‟t be published.

M.H.L.G. But every L.A. will know.

Ch. Exch. Then have election now – before the Budget.

L.P.S. I support Ch. Exch. – at least for purposes of decision to-day. But must we wait till July?

First Secy Advance plan in March.

M.H.L.G. Not true mftre. wd. be in congested areas – except in new towns in South. Otherwise, will certainly try to concentrate in “spare” areas.

Answer to pre-emption is deliberate depression of housing by Tories, wh. we must redress as a special case.

M.P. Must resist pre-emption: unfair to other Depts.

S/S. D. I agree. But won‟t solve short-term problem of aircraft workers.

? Press L.A.‟s to use indd methods for existing programmes. Otherwise case for extra 12,000 weak – until July review and review of long-term housing programme.

M.H.L.G. L.A.‟s won‟t apply indd methods to existing programmes.

M.A.F.F. I support M.H.L.G. – in terms of proper local planning.

Ch. Whip Don‟t overlook export potential.

M. Lab. I support Ch. Exch.

C.S. Subject to Ch. Exch.‟s serious warning, I wd. put housing v. high in priorities.

M.O.D. Must continue to emphasise modn as basis of our policy; but in this sphere shd. be linked either with existing p‟mmes or with exports. If only linked to future, not politically effective.

F. S/S. Must set Ch. Exch.‟s warnings against our own economic and political policies. No impact on Exch: and effect on intl opinion must be weighed against need to bring under-employed resources into use and current political realities.

Ch. Exch. But will M.H.L.G. curtail private sector?

M.H.L.G. Yes.

Ch. Exch. Then let us see the proposals for this.

M.H.L.G. But it is Ch. Exch. who controls private sector!

P.M. I personally support M.H.L.G. – even then programme will be smaller than in ‟48, soon after war. Priorities clearly wrong.

Cab. equally divided.

Get figures right – E. &amp; W. Total starts in 1964 – 426,000 of wh. ? 151,000 were public, 22,000 were for system builds. It shd. be 27,000 by end ‟65. Therefore if no increase in programme, number of brick built houses shd. be about same.

Three questions: a) private sector. Eschew interest rates as means of control. But how limit new starts?

b) What is saving of resources from Control of Office legn? Is extension of this control an extra margin?

Must have answers. Mere deferment to July uneconomic in terms of bldg. weather. But ? wait for interim Plan in March. And meanwhile produce diagram of regional allocn with details of control to prevent increase in conventional bldg. (S/S. S. shd. have some chance) by some system of licensing for non-essential bldg. Need not wait for March. Include manpower.

F. S/S. Control of offices won‟t ease pressure for about a year, given pipeline.

P.M. Even so, P.B.T. shd. explain further possibilities.

In general, beware of relating demand to static supply. To create a new demand can increase supply. And we must fulfil our electoral promise to redress balance between public &amp; private sector.

S/S. S. Not enough private bldg. in Scotland; and not same system of control of starts. May have to be a separate memm.

[Exeunt M.H.L.G: M.P.B.W: M. Lab.

4. Aid to Zambia. C(65) 20. [Enter Parly. Sec. B/T.

C.S. As in memm. Case rests not on commitment but on political vulnerability of Kaunda and our interest in keeping Z. with us, not only for sake of copper. Therefore link with emergency planning for economic war with S. Rh. Tie to U.K. goes as far as possible without creating offence.

M.O.D. I agree. Must back Kaunda. Expectns after discn of Fedn v. real. And devt potential of Z. v. great.

Also our £10m. much cheaper in long run than Ch. Secy‟s proposal – since it wd. settle, over 5 years, debt issue and wd. include both planning for UDI and incentive for expatriates (who will otherwise leave as to 80%). Ch. Secy‟s proposal wd. keep debt issue alive.

Our proposal (defence aid apart) wd. be within my Dept.‟s agreed 5 yr. prog.

Ch. Secy No economic case for any aid at present. And no problem for Z. in terms of foreign exchange reserves. V. Falls Report stressed aid in relation to need.

On political grounds Z. wants £15m. outright. M.O.D. offers £10m. loan. Therefore this will not suffice: and more realistic to emphasise our difficulties (particly in terms of B/P) and confine ourselves to £2m., subject to review in a year‟s time.

M.P. Cessation of coal supply wd. mean 2 m. tons (or 1-1½ m. tons if Kariba available). If we had to supply this, wd. be within the £10m.

S/S. D. Z. important qua o‟flying rights and to rescue U.K. citizens, if necy. Therefore I support £10m. But only about £1m. wd. be really defence aid.

P.M. Easiest if we present as Defence aid?

M.O.D. Watch local political impact.

S/S. W. Must buttress Kaunda.

M. Tech. I agree. But no great hurry to pay the money: and that blunts criticism of financing rich country. Merely a political gesture of support.

Ch. Duchy. Intl criticism is equally applicable to other cases – not only Z.

Ch. Exch. They may default on (external) railway loans: and they will ask for help for this. £10m. won‟t be the end.

P.M. Danger of pressure on K. v. great. Therefore concede £10m. as a political insurance, provided within M.O.D. 5 yr. programme and includes, if possible, railway loans.

5. Defence White Paper. C(65) 19.

P.M. Approved by O.P.D.

M. Tech. What scope for comment or assessment?

P.M. Only interim document: full review of commitments etc. in July. Till then we are not committed by W.P. See para. 2 - &amp; elsewhere.

S/S. D. Represents cut of £55m. on inherited programme: first time for many years that rise in defence expre. less than rise in G.N.P.

M. Tech. But absolute figure v. large.

Ch. Exch. And will still rise for a year or two before levelling off.
