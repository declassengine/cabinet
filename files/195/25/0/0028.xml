C.C. (65) 35 1 July 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip.

L.P. As in Statement. ? Need for a week‟s extension into August.

Affected by - .

2. Capital Punishment (oral).

L.P. Can still be completed if extension into August and fortnight‟s spill-over in autumn. But involves debate after 7 p.m. with suspension: and must accept risk Bill may be lost.

P.M. Agree – provided promoter (Silverman) co-operates as regards amendments on Report (“life sentence”) and length of speeches on 3R. Must also press Speaker to accept closure, if necessary.

3. Oversea Affairs (oral).

a) Algeria.

F.S. New Govt. appears to be in control. We shall therefore maintain normal relations, tho‟ no act of formal recogn required.

b) W.E.U.

F.S. At recent meeting, I spoke on Vienna initiative. Reception cordial; but at next meeting (after Copenhagen E.F.T.A. meeting) they will want more infmn.

c) Viet Nam.

P.M. China have rejected Mission: U.S.S.R. put decision on V.N: Hanoi ambivalent, but may be trying to split Mission. Latter wd. prob. oppose this, and efforts to persuade Hanoi to receive Mission as a whole continues.

d) Germany: Offset Agt. [Enter Ch. Secy Tsy

Ch. Secy Current agt (to March 1966) promised offset of exchange costs “as far as possible”. £85m. a year in all: in first 15 months £30m. paid!

New agt includes (i) immediate payment of £42m. (= difference between £30m. paid and amount required to unfreeze Arms Deposit A/C).

(ii) operation of A/C. (£22½m.) – to be released to finance addl Br. exports to G. or third countries (in sterling area) on basis of being matched £ for £ by new G. payments to U.K.

As regards 3rd year (from March 1966), agreed on £54m. as kind of commitment to be written in Agt – on basis that Fedl Govt. will “see to it” that this is paid.

This gives about £170 m. over 3 years – as against our target of £180m. No new guarantees about size of Br. forces in G: issue open after 3 yrs.

P.M. Ensure that M.O.D., Defence &amp; other Depts. brought into consultn about export financing.

4. Future Legislative Programme C(65) 85.

L.P. As in memm.

C.S. Add Gambia republican constn and possible amdt to Br. N.A. Act on Quebec to Essential Bills.

L.P. On main programme, ? add Dissolution of Convocations.

P.M. Balance of List B about right. (Land Cmn W.P. best deferred to Sept?) Ensure enough major Bills ready at outset of new Session.

F. S/S. If gaps ? advance Restrve Practices from List C.

L.P. And Govt. contracts Bill may have to be added.

P.M. Group Col. Indepce Bills as far as possible for 2R. purposes.

L. Ch. Reserve place for Law Reform Bill – if Commissioners make proposals – perhaps by new 2R. procedure.

P.M. On priorities – for policy decisions and drafting – I suggest:-

I. &amp; Steel: Law Cmn: Local Govt. finance: Housing finance;

Income guarantees: Earnings related benefits: and corresponding Scottish Bills.

Perhaps add leasehold enfranchisement &amp; reorgn of reserve forces: and Prices and Incomes Board. [Exit M.H.L.G.

[Enter M/S. Scot. Office.

5. Financial Position of the Coal Industry C.(65) 87 &amp; 89.

F. S/S. As in C(65) 87. Demand will fall: and assets will become valueless at rate suggested. Therefore either write off £250m. and suspend interest on next £150m. or write off all £400m. now. Tsy. oppose suspension of interest as bad precedent &amp; wd. prefer complete write off. E.D.C. unanimously (otherwise) favoured this course.

? add subsidies, on tapering basis, to cushion social impact of accelerated closures and act as incentive to secure union‟s co-opn. Wd. also help to keep any price increase this year to minimum – e.g. 1%+, applicable only to certain types of solid fuel.

M.P. £400m. means writing off about half of Bd.‟s capital. If so, must justify by distinguishing between assets wh. no longer exist and those wh. are disappearing. Must therefore discuss this with N.C.B. before deciding on scope of legn. Subsidies bad. Exodus of labour averaging 1000 a week (from productive as well as redundant pits). Subsidies wd. be disincentive to this: and are opposed by N.C.B. And tapering wd. not happen. On this basis price increase might be 2-3%.

Ch. Secy £250m. is losses and assets (£150m.). Another £150m. doubles write off of assets, and therefore shd. take full account of social costs of accelerated closure programme. Subsidies, in addition, are unnecessary; wd. distort the position; wd. be a disincentive to closures; and wd. be a dangerous precedent.

P.B.T. Main effort shd. be on introducing new work in areas affected. ? link any measures on closures with e.g. Schemes E. &amp; F.

I oppose subsidies: money better spent on promoting new industries.

P.M. This shd. be planned by D.E.A. &amp; B/T. in conjunction with N.C.B. and shd. be clearly identified with closures programme.

[Exit S/S. E.S.

S/S. W. Closures programme has gone well so far. Henceforward may be more difficult. Must be phased, in agreement between N.C.B. &amp; N.U.M. If subsidies wd. help this, I favour them.

M/S. Scot. No strong views on subsidies on merits. But linked with regional price surcharges, wh. we oppose. Subsidies, if approved, must not sweep this under the carpet.

M.P. Can‟t operate on basis of viable sectors wholly carrying unviable sectors. Regional price surcharges designed to hold reasonable balance on this.

Ch. Duchy. Subsidies transfer from N.C.B. to Govt. responsy for phasing closures programme. This is wrong and puts Govt. in embarrassing posn with N.U.M. Write off of £400m. shd. suffice.

F. S/S. Principle conceded in case of cotton. Therefore no precedent. Moreover, run down must be speeded up, since 200 m. tons target has been abandoned and will be replaced by 175m tons very soon. Subsidies are only positive proposal in our package to deal with this. They wd. reduce price increase, wh. wd. otherwise make coal less competitive and thus aggravate our problem by making economic pits uneconomic.

P.M. ? Offer, in addn to write off, to discuss with industry on (unqualified) fund devoted to spending closures in terms of direct social costs involved and introduction of new industries etc. This might not help price issue; but it wd. make for better control over closures programme without involving us in automatic or open-ended commitment. Money might be raised by Schemes D, E &amp; F. Announce to-day: F. S/S. &amp; I. shd. see draft. Regional price differenn shd. be further considered by M.P.

[Exit M.P.

6. Home Defence &amp; the Territorial Army C.(65) 86.

H.S. As in memm. On balance, I favour retaining T.A. for civil defence.

S/S. D. I can‟t agree. Civil defence not meaningful in any case: and exclusion of T.A. won‟t make it any less so. In a “bolt from blue” sitn, T.A. cdn‟t be mobilised in time. Nor is it known that main function of T.A. is civil defence: but, when reorgn for mily purposes is carried out, this will become known and recruiting will fall off. “Home Guard” wd. not be effective substitute; and wd. reduce savings.

P.M. Confine discussn to this issue – not whole qun of future of T.A.

M/S. S.O. I support H.S. qua Scotland. If T.A. goes, what is to take its place?

F. S/S. I support S/S. D. – both for sake of defence economies and because use of T.A. in circs. envisaged is unrealistic.

M.A.F.F. Remember need to guard food stocks.

P.M. Must consider how T.A. cd. be replaced for c.d. purposes. Meanwhile approve course (a). But no public statement about future of T.A. as a whole.

7. Sunday Observance. C.(65) 84.

H.S. As in memm – para. 12. S/S. W. wants statement on l‟hold enfrent before statement on S. Obsvce! I wd. accept this: and any special Welsh provision can be discussed on free vote.

P.M. This means Govt. provide facilities for free expression of Parly opinion, but no more.

L.P. Shd. be introduced as Private Member‟s Bill – not by Home Secy.

H.S. I accept.

Col. Sec. Another demand on legve time. And even a free vote can embarrass Members in their constituencies.

F. S/S. This was true of murder Bill.

P.M. And no commitment qua timing of introdn of Bill.

F.S. Leave whole thing to P. Member. [Exit F. S/S.

P.M. And we aren‟t ready to make statement on l‟hold enfrent.

Let H.S. say only that Govt. will help a P. Member – but no commitment on timing of Bill. Statement on l‟hold enfrent cd. then be made before time is found for Bill.

Alternatively, use a backbench Motion as means of testing opinion?

L. Ch. Might confuse issues: go straight to a Bill.

P.M. Then revert to my first proposal.

Ch. Whip. Don‟t touch it at all!

P.M. Then defer decision until we have settled l‟hold enfrent; and meanwhile say must wait on other legve priorities and forecast further statement before Recess.

S/S. D. Say, on 8 July, Govt. cannot find time for this in foreseeable future; but, if P. Member introduces Bill, Govt. will provide drafting assistance etc.
