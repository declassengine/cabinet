C.C. (65) 62 18 November 1965 10 a.m.

[Absent for first part of discussion.]

Prices and Incomes Policy: Armed Forces Pay.

(C.(65) 144 &amp; 148 continued: C.(65) 154.

S/S. D. Choice is between new compromise and no refce. to Bd. In view of short time, refce. cd. only be on qun whether Grigg amount right. Must pay forces adequately for sake of recruitment. Amount (£52m.) irrelevant if award fair: therefore, if Bd find in favour of Grigg, Ch. Exch. must commit himself in advance to accept it.

On size of amount, norm for officers wd. be 7%, for O.R.‟s 9½%. Cd. 5% extra for officers and 3% for O.R.‟s be justified on grounds of special factors wh. Bd are required to take into a/c – ie on grounds of allces. and emoluments and not only basic pay. Total amount can be accommodated within defence ceiling, if „pay‟ is ignored.

Issue is political dynamite: therefore try to show award not inconsistent with p. &amp; i. policy and avoid refce. to Bd. And Service morale already under severe strain – to be aggravated by D. Review. Don‟t provoke explosion by ditching pay award at last minute after 2½ years arrears. In absolute terms troops not well paid: average policeman better paid than average soldier. [Ch. Exch. contested.]

If Cab. reject me Ch. of S. must be heard.

P.M. 12½% in Annex A on easier basis of compromise than 18%.

2 years 8 months in arrear? If so, wd. give (at 3½%) 9⅓%.

S/S. D. For OR‟s period of analogue is from 31 July: for officers 1 April.

F. S/S. But no lagging: simply a different 2 year period as base of comparison.

S/S. D. But civilian analogues are moving ahead meanwhile.

Ch. Exch. That will be made good next time.

S/S. D. Will still be 2 years late. System must be changed, so that Forces pay moves more or less simultaneously with civilian pay. Hence need for refce to Bd on future system.

P.M. Agree: and if compary is to be preserved, must be one body, not several. Consider Annex A. of C.(65) 154.

F. S/S. Consider Annex C!

S/S. D. Can‟t pin to 7% interim. That will provoke explosion. Must be clear whether purpose of refce to Bd is to justify payment of G. award or to justify payment of something less? Can‟t shuffle off Cab.‟s responsy to Bd. Cab. must decide whether to act and, if so, by how much.

P.M. ? Compromise on Annex A: 2 months not one: accept 9¼% interim: Ch. Exch. shd. privately agree in advance to accept Bd‟s findings.

S/S. D. Must consider whether 9¼% interim enough.

Ch. Exch. You can‟t job back on Annex A! If so, I can‟t commit myself in advance to accept Bd‟s findings, without knowing Cab.‟s views on other items of public expre.

Ch. Duchy. Must consider whether other compary bodies – Franks, Kindersley etc. – shd. be brought under Bd. Therefore refer Forces‟ Pay to Bd on T. of R. as in Annex A(ii) only – no other conditions at all. Bd‟s view to be referred to Cab. Time limit of 2 months. No wider refce. yet.

L. Ch. Must put Franks etc. to Bd. And everybody shd. be treated alike.

P.M. Need not prejudge doctors – since report not yet available and might recommend only 3½%.

Ch. Exch. But Franks has himself examined the facts recently. Grigg hasn‟t: it is only result of applicn of a formula. We cd. therefore accept Franks (or my proposal): we needn‟t accept Grigg.

P.M. But public opinion more favourable to Forces than civil servants. Govt. shd. not be seen to treat latter more generously than former.

Ch. Exch. But Franks proposal doesn‟t exceed norm.

S/S. D. If Grigg to be announced as referred to Bd, will this be associated with some indication of commitment to pay on 1 Ap?

P.M. Shd. suffice to indicate only advisory opinion and decision reserved to Cab.

S/S. D. Accept – provided inter-departl agt on T. of R.

Pay of Higher Civil Service. C.(65) 146.

P.M. Follows from above that Franks shd. be referred to Bd.

Ch. Exch. No: will be unwelcome to C. Service and resented by Franks Cttee., who may resign. Must therefore consult Franks first.

P.M. Must decide to refer in principle – but administer to F. as gently as possible. If he resigns, he must do so on this, not on Ch. Exch.‟s compromise.

Ch. Duchy. Yes: impossible to cut one and refer the other. Must refer both in light of interrelation.

P.M. Wider remit to Bd on while issue of compary shd. wait Bd.‟s advisory opinion on Forces. Meanwhile F. S/S. to ventilate at E.D.S.

[Exit Col. Sec.

Rhodesia (oral). [Enter A.G.

P.M. Daily meetings. Nothing yet to report.

F.S. We just managed to secure initiative in calling Secy C. We were criticised for having allowed sitn to develop and then failing to take adequate measures. These views crystallised in Ivory Coast resn, (in oppn to ours), calling for

force. We had to try to avoid veto, if possible; and that meant ensuring less than 7 votes in favour of extreme resn. I. Coast is now drafting resn avoiding force – but it includes refce. to i) special interest of O.A.U. (wh. we cd. prob. accept – provided it doesn‟t give Secy C. approval in advance for any measures wh. O.A.U. may take and ties them only to implementing measures in resn).

ii) what our policy shd. be when idi over – i.e. one man one vote. I tried to limit this to general recommn of restorn of democracy.

iii) range of further measures. Our first steps widely regarded as inadequate: pressure for trade and oil embargo. Must try to limit, if not to study group, to general injuncn to everybody to do all they can to embargo trade and oil.

iv) Ch. VII language – i.e. mandatory resns – or Ch. VI language – recommns. Even on Kashmir, S.C. did not resort to Ch. VII. Therefore try to avoid mentioning either by describing as a sitn the maintenance of which constitutes a threat to intl peace.

May get away with this. But for how long – if our measures don‟t work and we continue to refuse to use force. ? Hand it over to U.N. as a trusteeship. Must be ready to consider this.

Shall not veto any resn without refce. to Cab.

P.M. We can‟t abdicate responsy.
