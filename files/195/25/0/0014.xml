C.C. (65) 20 1 April 1965 10 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral).

L.P. As in statement. Budget Tuesday 6 April.

2. Oversea Affairs (oral).

a) V-Nam.

F.S. I have expressed sympathy to U.S. &amp; S. V-N. Ambassadors for outrage in Saigon. U.S. confirmed no violent retaliation and understanding on prior informn. Rumours of N. V-N. willingness to have confce: but no certainty.

P.M. ? Put Hanoi earlier in Gordon Walker‟s itinerary.

3. Outline Plan C(65) 53. [Enter Parly Sec. M/L.

F. S/S. As in memm. Defer publicn, partly because not sufficiently a real plan, &amp; partly because discloses absence of vital decisions.

But if real Plan by summer or early autumn, much to be done: and no chance if defence review not ready till July. Must take some defence decisions quite soon.

P.M. Agree on non-publicn: but beware of letting Plan wait on individual decisions and latter wait on former.

Ch. Exch. July certainly too early: aim at Sept/Oct.

Note para. 27: “substantially faster” does not mean more than we had in mind when discussed pub. sector expre.

And figures in table in para. 25 too optimistic on basis of our present commitments.

P.M. Para. 27 deals with expre., not estimates.

On para. 25, I agree – so long as private sector (housebuilding) is uncontrolled.

P.B.T. Have skeleton plan soon – for decisions on priorities: and fill out later.

F. S/S. I shall aim at Sept. for final plan. But it will be a rolling Plan, one year at a time: therefore room for adjustment.

M.O.D. Interim Plan good – setting for decisions wh. wd. otherwise be unpalatable.

P.M. Better done by speech by F. S/S. in Budget debate.

M.A.F.F. Don‟t publish interim Plan.

Ch. Duchy. ? Defer decision on long-term Plan until after short term Budget. But may then be worth publicn, in reinforcement of F. S/S.‟s speech.

M. Techy Don‟t publish: we haven‟t enough informn. Must allow for impact of drive in techy; otherwise we are wasting our time. Therefore aim at autumn.

P.M. But must finance this techl expansion: problem is to encourage growth of right sort of prodn.

F. S/S. But even if so, the 25% may not increase in total. Can only tell gradually: hence rolling nature of plan.

Forecasts of this year‟s rate of growth v. depressing. M. Techy too optimistic.

P.M. Decide not to publish. But reconsider presentation of policies after Budget debate, provided not a Plan.

4. TSR2 or F-111A. C(65) 57. [Enter M. Avn.

P.M. (a) Some of informn lacking in Feby now available (including inability of B.A.C. to produce firm price): and ? matter now ripe for decision.

(b) Substitn means Budgetary saving of £250-300 m. at expense of dollar outlay of ?£400-500 m. V. doubtful whether released resources wd. create required exports. From this point of view a bad bargain.

(c) But cancelln, even allowing for (b), might reinforce Budget in strengthening confidence in sterling.

(d) Therefore relevant to ask whether cancelln must involve purchase of TFX. Not wholly certain till def. review. But other “mixes” possible; and roles must be clarified.

(e) Add political impact of cancelln: redeployment less formidable than we originally feared (even tho‟ can‟t discuss with B.A.C.). But argt of dependence on U.S. aircraft industry (who are increasingly forceful) is v. strong. See F.O. tel. 2550 to W‟ton. And technical dependence cd. mean political dependence – v. damaging.

Must therefore decide whether take risk of cancelling TSR2 and then finding TFX inescapable. If so, I wd. prefer to let TRS2 run on rather than accept now extra burden on B/P.

S/S. D. Expre. on TSR2 mounting: and no informn affecting decision likely before autumn.

On need for aircraft, I have examined “mixes” of Bucc, Phantom, Kestrel etc; but I have concluded that we are likely to need aircraft with range &amp; payload of TSR2/TFX, both for strike role against hostile aircraft on the ground and for reconnaissance to anticipate hostile action. Ferry range eliminates many staging posts: and in theatre itself can be used from wide variety of bases. Therefore if must remain able to fight limited war anywhere, without being wholly dept on U.S., must have some aircraft of this type.

On cost, depends on ratio of cost/effectiveness for these roles.

On military grounds, TFX MKI inferior to TSR2: MKII slightly superior.

Cost depends on numbers. We have cut (by eliminating conflicts in Europe) by 48 to 110 – min. to sustain e.g. Indonesian or Gulf war in „70‟s. But 110 worst assumption. For TSR2 we have only target (i.e. no profit) price, excess over which falls on us. On this basis TSR2 wd. cost £4.8m. more than spent already and £5.8m. in total. TFX MKI price is firm at £2.1m. Addn avionics for MKII (incl. our contingency addn) wd. make it £2.6m. If include £70m. interest in TFX and £70m. cancelln charges on TSR2, then 3.6m. for TFX, but running costs wd. be only half those of TSR2. Hence saving of £250m. over 13 years on budget – and £300m. over next 5 years at v. small dollar outlay. Wd. bring total saving on aircraft to £600m.

Therefore cancel TSR2 &amp; take option on TFX – wh. we may be able to reduce even if no cut in commitments. If cut to 50, cost advantage of TFX v. great, - unit cost of TSR2 is £9.4m. in total, while unit cost of TFX wd. vary v. little &amp; wd. be only about half residual cost of TSR2. But must have option in order to justify cancelling TSR2: can‟t decide to dispense altogether without prejudging defence review.

Dependence on U.S. less if we have some TFX‟s of our own.

$ burden certainly heavy: &amp; not likely to be offset by more than half. But residual half only £20m. a year: v. small in relation to total $ imports.

Option shd. be for 10 MKI on 1 Jan. ‟68 (date of order) for training in ‟68. Order for MKII wd. be deferred till April 67 and wd. be wholly open. Spey engines a possible offset.

M. Avn I don‟t oppose cancelln of TSR2: but substn by TFX a different matter. Don‟t exaggerate $ earnings of released resources, particularly loss of aircraft exports. Foolish to commit ourselves to buy aircraft wh. we may not be able to afford.

Absence of B.A.C. fixed price only protecn against crippling loss. And comparison with TFX price can be misleading – I want to study S/S. D.‟s latest figures.

S/S. D. They are firm and largely indept of numbers bought.

M. Avn But does vary according to whether number is above or below 70. Must study the figures more if to rely publicly on lack of firm B.A.C. price.

10 TFX MKI meaningless – unless means commitment to buy MKII‟s: and then decision has to be based on switch, not price. Beware of eagerness of U.S. to sell and of difficulty of buying our way out of option. And don‟t overrate the offsets.

For these reasons, cancel, don‟t switch but keep some option and explore other mixes.

P.M. Adjourn (for Princess Royal‟s memorial service). Reassemble at 10 p.m.
