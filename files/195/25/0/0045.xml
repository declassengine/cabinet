C.C. (65) 53 21 October 1965. 5 p.m.

1. Rhodesia (oral). [Enter M/S. F.O: A. Gen.

P.M. Rh. Govt. have accepted our visit. Have asked for confirmn of our terms.

2. Iron &amp; Steel Nationalisation (oral).

C.S. Good reasons for deferring: but unfavourable political impact on Party.

Ch. Duchy Nothing at Party Confce. to shake general disposition at Chequers.

Reinstatement now would wreck planned priorities of rest of programme – wh. are more genuinely socialistic than mere natn.

L. Ch. This Session is for popular measures – several of wh. wd. have to be sacrificed for steel.

M.T. We have created image of a responsible Govt: confirmed at Party Confce. Don‟t spoil it by reinstating steel. But if reject on ground of congestion if one element contributing to it is immigration. Therefore defer immigration Bill.

M.A.F.F. No merit in pressing steel on doctrinal grounds: generally accepted that other measures have priority. To include steel is to invite an Election on this issue.

C.S. Steel must be natd: but when? Provided this is made clear as real point, accept deferment on grounds of strain on Party of getting it through.

P.B.T. I support M.H.L.G. – no chance of getting most of rest of programme through if we inject steel.

H.S. Defer: and make clear only deferred. But include immigration Bill.

S/S. E.S. Defer – on grounds not of top ec. priority. Any Govt. must retain freedom of action to decide when to go to country. No real overlap between feeling on steel &amp; feeling on immigrn.

Ch. Whip. I agree. Programme requires 82 leg. days – far more than available. Steel wd. eject Local Govt. finance, both Housing Finance Bills &amp; Workmen‟s Compensn. And Party wd. not like to go to country on this issue.

S/S. S. Must go ahead with housing and local govt. Steel wd. mean that we cdn‟t do anything but steel.

M.O.D. Some Bills cd. be sacrificed – e.g. Road Safety: Co. Alce: etc. And watch immigration.

P.M. Majority favour deferment. Easier if another clear measure of natn: docks a disappointment – so far. But may yield something: also aircraft industry. And if legn on steel necy anyhow, might justify inclusion in Speech as an instalment?

M.P. If defer, can‟t leave as is: and may have to readjust whole policy of W.P.

On limited Bill, R.P. Court ruling has led Board to ask for new pricing powers to meet growing weak market.

P.M. This means legalising a cartel! Not v. attractive politically!

M. Techy If industry left free to rearrange assets, hybrid Bill unavoidable. Deferment this Session means deferment this Parliament – i.e. perhaps for five years. Our order of priorities has changed – perhaps rightly. But we are abandoning public ownership in favour of other Bills wh. cd. be dropped e.g. P. &amp; I. Board. And we are breaking faith with Party – something with which I wd. not want to go along.

P.M. Must accept that deferment means hybrid Bill in ‟66-67 Session, if assets dissipated. Only safeguard is threat in W.P. &amp; co-opn of indy. ? Take staty powers to enforce this safeguard – in anticipn of natn.

F. S/S. Wrong to interfere with private enterprise without turning it into public enterprise.

M.H.L.G. And must accept can‟t natse steel except in first Session of a new Parlt with a working majority. But stick to intention to do it in next Parlt.

M.P. Can‟t just not do it and leave as is.

P.M. Accept: and admit will legislate by hybrid Bill, wh. will deal with intervening jiggery-pokery.

A.G. Better to say we stick to W.P. provided industry does.

P.M. V. well: but if we are forced to adopt a hybrid, that must deal with mischief in interval.

Can‟t put anything in Speech. Must therefore decide: and majy favours deferment on grounds wh. I will explain in Debate on Address.

If amdt to Speech, reinstating Bill, moved, must hope dissidents wd. support us.

F. S/S. No reason why we shd. stick to compensn clauses if industry begins to make mischief. They were appropriate to legn in early ‟65: not necy appropriate to legn in ‟66.

P.M. Agree: circulate formula.

3. Legislative programme 1965-66. C.(65) 133.

L.P. Too heavy: oversubscribed by 26 days.

P.M. Explained investt grants Bill – wh. can go upstairs if introduced early.

M.H.L.G. L. Govt. Finance also v. important &amp; heavy.

L.P. If omit starred Bills &amp; list 5, still 26 days in excess. Casualties will help: and Recesses can be cut a bit. But still ……….

P.M. Even so, Speech is perhaps not for a normal Session: put a lot in the shop- window.

M. Techy Therefore reinstate steel!

Ch. Exch. No merit in overloading Speech beyond capability. At least have priorities.

Annex to C(65) 133 discussed.

a) Subsume C‟w. Immigration in Expiring Laws. Consider.

b) Oversea Aid: cd. be done under Appropn Act – except for pensions.

c) P.W.L: ? amalgamate with Local Govt. Finance.

d) Investt Grants: must add Bill on Reorgn Corpn.

e) Criminal Justice: strong case for inclusion.

f) Children: cd. stand over for one more Session.

P.M. Oppn misuse Private Members‟ Time. ? Be tough about this.

L.P. Will annoy our own people too.

P.M. Can‟t drop 26 days: perhaps C‟w. Imm. – but keep rest and face election, if necy., on basis of unfinished business rather than unfulfilled pledges.

? Drop C.w. Imm. in exchange for deferring steel: and put C‟w. Imm. in Election Manifesto.

L.P. Keep C‟w. Imm. but review posn in Jany.

H.S. I agree: if Bill appears to have been dropped, must I admit this on Exp. Laws Bill? Impossible – in light of M‟batten Mission, White Paper etc. But might be manageable if merely deferred, like Steel, on grounds of pressure on time. P.M. shd. make clear in Debate on Address.

P.M. Agree: on this basis take C‟w. Imm. out. Put everything else in shop window: and review in Jan. O‟sea Aid included, without priority of drafting.

4. Queen‟s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament. C.(65) 134.

Discussed and amendments agreed.
