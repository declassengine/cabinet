C.C. (65) 28 6 May 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip.

L.P. As in Statement.

2. Oversea Affairs (oral).

a) Dominican Republic.

F.S. Bosch radical, not Communist: overthrown in 1963 by military junta, now itself overthrown by pro-Bosch elements. Initially worsted, rising was taken over by trained faction, who distributed arms wholesale. At that point U.S. intervened, in order to protect foreign lives (including U.K.). But numbers (now 20,000) exceed those required for this purpose. U.S. then invoked O.A.S., who have sent Commission which has established cease fire. They may now propose an O.A.S. peacekeeping force, until political soln. If so, better than might have been expected. Must discourage premature action by U.N. (including Soviet motion condemning U.S.) until O.A.S. action matures.

Sitn complicated by L.B.J.‟s statement that U.S. will not tolerate Communism in the hemisphere. But prompt [U.S.] action was needed.

P.M. And Communism was involved. But U.S. mustn‟t swing to fascism in response. Fortunate, therefore, that O.A.S. have taken over.

b) Commonwealth.

C.S. Austr. &amp; N.Z. Cabs. sent greetings.

P.M. And we have succeeded in getting cease fire in Rann of Kutch.

On Rhodesia, hope to play out time in U.N. until after election, and abstain on resn – at cost of appearing to accept U.N. jurisdiction (whereas veto would safeguard this), which might be taken in Rh. as pretext for u.d.i.

3. Deduction of Union subscriptions from pay. C.(65) 69.

[Enter P.M.G.

L.P. As in memm. No legn required: cd. be done unobtrusively.

P.M.G. I agree. No risk of Govt. knowing whether employees pay political levy: and no risk of unions having use of levy for a year.

But safeguards essential to anticipate union pressure and to enable individuals to exercise freedom of choice.

Approval will enable me to reject closed shop in postal unions.

M. Lab. I agree.

Ch. Exch. And I.

P.M. Repayment, where appropriate, must be efficient. ?Appoint Trustees for this purpose and to deal with complaints.

Ch. Exch. Rely on Registrar General of Friendly Societies: &amp; T. Union Act. 1913.

M. Techy Must cater for man who changes his mind – e.g. wants to contract out after initially contracting in.

M. Lab. He will have the right to do so.

M. Techy But tiresome for employer.

Ch. Duchy. Must be provided for – adequate notice etc. – in general Whitley Council discussions.

P.M. Approve. [Exit P.M.G.

4. Immunities and Privileges for the C‟wealth Secretariat. C.(65) 70.

C.S. Ought to concede unique status to senior officials. Any other C‟w. country wd. do so. And important staff shd. be equated with High Commission personnel in order to prevent evasion.

Ch. Duchy. Personally, I agree. E.S.R.O. terms inadequate: and full diplomatic status shd. be conceded. Compromise – between E.S.R.O. and diplomatic scales – has some justification and U.N. precedent. But rest of C‟w. will regard as mean &amp; niggling. Therefore concede full diplomatic status – as unique.

[Enter FS/S.

H.S. Legn wd. be required. In 1964 8,600 parking tickets (of wh. 3,600 C‟w.) were cancelled for dip. immy. In 13 more serious cases, C‟w. dip. immy had to be conceded.

Ch. Exch. And if related to functions, E.S.R.O. (or compromise?) scale wd. suffice. Otherwise, risk of extension.

P.M. Message from M.O.D. on C.E.L.U. – just this point! But tail need not wag dog!

F.S. Proposal wd. be more generous than for some intl bodies. But U.S. concede special treatment for O.A.S. repres: and C‟w. is unique. I support Ch. Duchy.

L.P. And I.

M. Tech. I support Ch. Exch.

S/S. E.S. And I.

P.M. Concede full dip. immy – as unique.

5. The Law relating to homosexual offences. C.(65) 68.

H.S. As in memm.

P.M. Maybe right objectively. But ticklish, with our majority, to give any Govt. backing or provide any Govt time. Must leave entirely to personal judgment. Therefore Lord Stonham shd. be neutral and maintain this is matter entirely for Private Member‟s time and free vote on personal views.

Ch. Duchy. This will kill it: no P.M. Bill can survive without help. If H/C. expresses clear view, it is Govt.‟s duty to do something about it. (Not necessarily on H/L. opinion only).

P.M. Up to P.M. to mobilise enough support to ensure view is clear.

S/S. D. No time for legn this Session in any event. Therefore avoid any commitment at this stage.

L.P. But avoid any undertaking not to obstruct.

S/S. D. Simply say can‟t undertake to find time for the Bill – wh. leaves it open.

L.P.S. Ministers in Lords shd. be free to vote.

P.M. Treat in every way as P.M. Bill wh. must take its chance in normal way without help (or obstruction!) from Govt. – tho‟ implied that, if opinion develops, issue can always be reopened.

Ministers shd. be free to vote in Lords.

6. Computers for Govt. Depts. C.(65) 65, 66 &amp; 67.

[Enter M.Avn: M.P.N.I.

F. S/S. As in C.(65) 65. Not a conflict between U.K. &amp; U.S. computer industries. Proposal is to discriminate in favour of U.K. company in case where it is already dependent on U.S. expertise etc. and rival U.S. company has been established in devt area with our encouragement.

In Scottish case, U.S. machine has considerable edge in performance etc; and a 25% lead in terms of cost. Therefore prefer I.B.M.

Agree that, if all early orders go to U.S. firms, discouraging to U.K. industry. Therefore try to get U.K. computer at Farnborough – either by limiting field of permitted tenders to U.K. companies (with list in favour of I.C.T.) – wh. wd. be wrong in principle and wd. not help U.K. industry to become competitive but wd. only encourage I.C.T. domination; or by allowing open tender and deciding, in light of result, whether we can take I.C.T. [Exit M.P.

M. Techy I am not trying to shut out U.S. company: we have asked them and they have refused, to make specially for us outside their company here. Govt. orders for c.‟s are not 30%: figure applies to whole public sector, over part of which we have no control. Only 10% of market is in question: and here we shd. follow U.S. practice. On cost 413,000 against 40,200 is v. small: I.B.M. includes over £300,000 of imported element, compared with over £200,000 for I.C.T. Comparison still more favourable, if allow for import surcharge.

I.C.T. capacity is adequate for job: only spare terms differ. And comparison is on basis of 1 shift working. Both machines cd. be stepped up.

Programming support: have I.C.T. been asked? And first time I.B.M. have provided 20 programmers – because it is first order for I.B.M. 360.

V. damaging precedent – wh. will be followed up. Hence my proposals in C.(65) 66. Consider U.S. practice – wh. compels us to try to undercut by 50% for Govt. purchases (wh. is what is in question). Where U.S. product is better – N.E.L. – we concede: but must encourage our own industries by period of grace in wh. Govt. sponsorship can have a chance to help in terms not only of production but also of operation, programming etc.

English Electric have just bid for Scottish case – only 5% over I.B.M. (as compared with 13% excess by I.C.T.). They can do this because they have just been given orders for 6 computers from G.P.O. We must encourage this kind of group ordering. Hence proposals in para. 10, including B.Elec., as regards Scotland. As regards F‟borough, can‟t gear the specificn to suit I.C.T; and can‟t admit I.B.M. and then turn them down. Therefore confine tenders to the three in para. 10(b). Also adopt principles in para. 5: and adopt system of collective ordering for Govt. Depts.

[Exit M.A.F.F]

We have not favoured I.C.T.: we are discussing with other two units as well – and we may need more money for N.R.D.C. as a result. We are pressing mergers etc; and are encouraging better management in I.C.T. Must have time, and provide help for 3 years, to allow these initiatives to mature: meanwhile favour U.K. industry. [Exit S/S. E.S.

M.P.N.I. Must avoid delay in paying pensions and any breakdown in arrangements. Recognised in para. 5(b) of C.(65) 66 – but 2 years unacceptable. U.K. machine may meet our needs: but we must have latitude if delay is long or any risk of breakdown.

Computers for sickness &amp; unemplt benefits: U.S. are in lead on cost (tho‟ delay wd. be less objectionable) – saving of £1.4m.

M. Techy Of course, delay damaging. But, given time for prodn and firm requirement, I.C.T. can compete.

P.M. We are politically committed to favour science based industries, particularly computer industry – wh. is badly lagging. And we face U.S. competn based on large home market. Therefore must adopt group Govt. ordering (as in case of G.P.O. orders), with centralised purchasing (with incidental advantage of influencing design &amp; research).

Entitled to give margin - ? 5% tolerance – in favour of devt areas. In Scotland, given E. Elecc offer, go back to U.K. industry and give target price: if they can make it (and meet reasonable conditions on installn etc.) they have the order. Simultaneously, encourage centralised ordering. Must defend against U.K.-based foreign companies (e.g. I.B.M.) on grounds of deliberate encouragement for U.K. production – the argt by which we justify our agricultural policy.

S/S. S. Sc. computer began in 1962: and tenders invited in March 1964 and received before election. E. Electric doesn‟t measure up in terms of time etc. Can‟t job back now, without unacceptable delay. And economy of £123,000 not negligible. 13 jobs lined up (after overcoming oppn of L.A.‟s etc): delay will cost £30,000 a month. Therefore total economy is over £450,000. And spare capacity in I.B.M. machine v. valuable, since work always grows. Running cost of I.B.M. is £11,000p.a. less than I.C.T. And must not discourage foreign investt in devt areas by retrospective discrimn – particularly after ruining Ferrantis by T.S.R.2 decision. Therefore must choose I.B.M. – especially since I.C.T. machine being chosen for I. Revenue at E. Kilbride.[Exit M. Lab.

Ch. Exch. U.K. industry shown to be less efficient and competitive than we thought. But chance to help it – by 15 in pipeline and 42 more under considn for Govt. use – irrespective of these cases. Scots must go ahead on I.B.M: but F‟borough cd.

be reconsidered and perhaps be given to U.K. firm. Meanwhile M. Techy shd. table proposals for reconstructing U.K. industry on more rational basis.

P.B.T. Centralised ordering essential. But I support F. S/S. We don‟t favour cars or aircraft: why then computers? Don‟t confuse U.K. industry with U.K. owned industry – I.B.M. v. important in devt areas and “second tender” procedure shd. apply to them and to Honeywell too. But Scots case shd. now go to I.B.M: on F‟boro open tender shd. be adopted with only modest prefce. to U.K. firm.

M. Avn Cdn‟t defend acceptance of I.C.T. tender on grounds of techl superiority. Must either confine tendering to 3 U.K. firms: or price diffl in favour of one of them must be incorporated and stated, but open to all.

[Exit Ch. Exch.

S/S. D. I favour the second, announcing the criteria. ? Special announcement, quantifying price diffl, in F‟boro case. But any general statement shd. refer to delay wh. is operationally unacceptable and price wh. is too high to make project uneconomic. (Specific limit – e.g. 25% - may put computers right out!)

M. T. Watch employment in devt areas. Therefore let I.B.M. have Scots order: and then centralise purchases.

M. Techy £3.27 m. of computers are imported – mainly from I.B.M. companies in other countries. But I.B.M. won‟t build here what we want. Computer market is growing: and no threat to empt. But Govt. purchases (only 10% of market) a different question: we ought not to provide I.B.M. with means of pioneer advt of their product. I.C.T. can cope with all work which Scots Depts. will throw up for a long time. We are not bound by tenders arranged by previous Govt.

P.M. Don‟t underrate U.S. threat: and don‟t concede “second tender” to U.S. firms in devt areas. Discuss imports with I.B.M. &amp; Honeywell – to redress it. Establish centralised buying by Govt. Depts, based on computer unit of M. Techy. They can then establish “rolling” forward programme with industry, but not on feather bedding basis.

Scots case gone too far to be reversed? But E. El. tender shd. be considered. And “second tender” shd. be adopted, even in Scot: but not for I.B.M. Farnboro‟ case – as proposed by M. Avn.

Policy must be announced in Govt. statement: redraft para. 5 – and let Offl Cttee. on Techy consider.
