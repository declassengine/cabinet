C.C. (65) 16 16 March 1965. 11 a.m.

1. Doctors‟ Pay. C.(65) 43.

M.H. As in memm. We maintain R. Body for quantum, whereas doctors want negotn with Govt. Important to help with provision of practices, even tho‟ Tsy. dissent.

Ch. Exch. I dissent on more than this – i.e. on whole posture.

Letter must recount past history and make our basic position clear. Ten day time limit particularly obnoxious. Therefore emphasise a) R.B. is their own choice of machinery: b) £5½m. ready to be paid out forthwith. Also ask doctors‟ own view of their duties and obligations – e.g. on 5½ day week, wh. will affect quantum of cash remunn. On this basis I wd. concede practices point.

P.M. Strengthen first sentence to make it clear cash addn is coming.

Add refce. to past history. Amend p.w. to make clear no more cash till Ap. ‟66 – leaving refce. to lack of agreement on how pricing of contract shd. be handled.

Conditions of service must be linked with cash remunn: therefore doctors must understand that Charter will not alter principle of determinn of quantum by R.B.

Cab. must be clear on these issues, in case of a break, therefore substitute stipn about R.B. for “leaving this one matter aside”.

M.H. Reserve recital of past history for debate?

Ch. Exch. No: put in letter.

F. S/S. Leave to Minister to decide.

But make clear 1 April ‟66 is end of current 3 year Agt.

P.M. Otherwise approve as amended – even if it means war with the doctors!
