C.C. (65) 56 2 November 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Rhodesia. C.(65) 142.

P.M. As in memm. Posn clear?

Way out for Smith now exists: I have told him privately that, if he would throw over right wing, he cd. lead Rh. away from u.d.i.

R.C. wd. have to be unanimous: Rh. have suggested, since chn to be ex-officio, two H.Cms shd. be other members.

But content of doct to be canvassed?

C.S. A.G. &amp; I failed to get concessions from Rh. Govt. on content.

We rejected S.‟s claim that P.M. had agreed R.Cmn shd. canvass only Rh. Govt‟s proposals &amp; claim that Consve Govt. had been ready to settle for 5th principle alone. But Rh. pop. opinion pressing for u.d.i. Therefore essential to play for time.

A.G. See Annex B. on our discussions after P.M. had left. Fundamental difference persists on retrogression and post-indepce modifn of constn to disadvantage of Afr. Rh. Govt. illustrated this by protest against U.K. refusal to acquiesce in preventative detention legislation. Also no concession on composn of blocking ⅓ or ¼: Rh. Govt. still want chiefs as addl Afrs., who wd. really control entrenched clauses. On majy rule, they remain determined to prevent it, by refusing to entrench clauses about composn of Legislature – wh., if unentrenched &amp; subsequently amended, can delay Afr. majy indefinitely. Only concession – 1 for 1 substn. My proposal of 2 for 1 was rejected.

Also no sign of any concession on racial discrimn.

P.M. Nor on educn: Parly Secy to M.O.D. found willingness only to expand primary educn. And that is pointless unless jobs available: but racial discrimn prevents Afr. from holding execve or supervisory posts. This squares with S.‟s contention in London that Rh. Govt. want Afr. educn for own sake – i.e. for more sophisticated menial tasks – but not in order to educate Afrs. politically. Educl advancement is therefore no soln.

In absence of effective blocking mechanism and entrenchment of relevant clause, several ways of delaying Afr. majy – as Smith admitted. Redn of

B Roll seats: increase of A Roll seats, by creation of new and smaller A constituencies: stooge Afrs. in A seats.

Chiefs no good: my interview with them confirmed this, since they did not really consult their Africans or themselves really understand diffce between entr. and unentr. clauses. But they opposed u.d.i.

Some chance that two factions of Afr. Nats. wd. work together: wd. accept Rh. Govt.‟s proposals being put to adult Afr. popn (incl. women), provided freedom to canvass without intimn and U.K. supervision of refm. Two leaders better than I had expected – tho‟ not up to other E. African leaders. Rh. Govt. treated them v. badly. Even Smith, who is best of Rh. Govt., wd. take every chance to frustrate „61 constn.

Non-Govt. Europeans – Beadle, Tredgold – were co-opve. Todd was seen: feels majy rule now premature – period of constl co-opn required. Welensky v. critical of manipln of public opinion. Shd. be available for interim Govt if u.d.i. is done &amp; fails. Press on our side.

Afr. leaders in other countries anxious that Nat. factions shd. co-operate. Kaunda moderate on issue: fears u.d.i. for effect on Zambia but solid with

other Afr. opinion on main question. Abubakar endorses us in principle and welcomes renewal of freedom of manoeuvre – has supported R.C. in public. Nkrumah published vicious statement about it but was v. friendly and is in no danger of leaving C‟w. Think I convinced all of them about difficulties of mily intervenn.

C.S. Nyerere says must be majy rule before indepce: no matter how long it takes. Obote more extreme – no blank cheque for R.C: and U.K. shd. use force in last resort. Banda welcomed R.C: and K. wd. be ready to influence Rh. Nats. to co-operate if R.C. genuine &amp; not a gimmick. (But Commn with Rh. Nats. not easy.)

P.M. I propose now that we have reached finality on concessions.

Diffce is one of basic political philosophy.

Shd. R.C. canvass Rh. Govt.‟s proposals – i.e. ‟61 constn with only consequential amdts. That was my first proposal – but on basis of refm, wh. wd. turn it down. More doubtful on R.C. procedure, since, tho‟ our presence wd. prevent it from going wrong, we cd. not say this publicly or to Afr. &amp; intl question. Moreover, no guarantee of free election – unless police state suspended for period and Afr. Nats. abandon violence &amp; intimn.

Four choices:-

1) Accept Rh. proposal – his proposals to be put by Cmn &amp; we accept its result. (We have reserved our posn on methods to be used by Cmn and want interim report, wh. Govts. must accept.)

2) Put Rh. proposals to Cmn, making it clear that we oppose it.

3) Put Rh. proposals &amp; our proposals: cf. Newfoundland &amp; Rh. itself in ‟23.

4) Reject all concessions &amp; insist doct must be our proposals – or else no R.C.

1) &amp; 2) wd. postpone u.d.i. for a few months: 3) &amp; 4) wd. probably provoke early u.d.i. – unless they lost their nerve or Cab. split irrevocably or S. felt psychological moment has passed.

I favour 3) – as consistent with our five principles.

M.O.D. ? 5th choice: Rh. proposals by a refm, wh. Nat. leaders wd. accept.

P.M. It wd. give him two choices – both acceptable to us. But if 5th choice produced affve answer, shd. we accept?

M.O.D. Yes – provided we were satisfied refm was fair.

P.M. But it wd. be altve to R.C: i.e. choice wd. be between 3 &amp; 5.

S/S. W. How cd. refm be fair?

P.M. Adult taxpayers are all registered: it cd. be done.

M.H.L.G. Not in a police State: 3 much better. Refm has awful risks.

M.O.D. But watch risk of Af. Boycott of R.C. – see S‟bury tel. 1558, para. 7. But Afrs. wd. accept refm.

F. S/S. Are we trying to gain time or to bring to a head?

P.M. Mustn‟t buy time at expense of appearing to sacrifice 5 principles. And mustn‟t appear to be blackmailed by threat of u.d.i.: avoid a Munich. If a u.d.i. let it come when, after making all efforts, we are still in defensible posn and have not compromised ourselves.

S/S. D. Right to try to delay u.d.i. as long as possible. But watch moral posn.

? 6th choice: doct to include Rh. Govt. proposals and ours: but put to refm rather than R.C.

A.G. Afrs. insisted on v. strict conditions for refm.

P.M. Can‟t adopt refm without abandoning R.C. prematurely.

? Add to our proposals improvement of Constl Commission‟s powers.

Add this to 3, by R.C: but if S. rejects, suggest same proposals by refm under safeguards, as fall back posn.

C.S. Even if no intimn, wd. Nats. have enough money &amp; pol. machine to put their case.

P.M. Yes – tho‟ source of money doubtful! But supervision of ballot boxes wd. have to be v. rigorous: at least supervisory commission and probably of individual ballot boxes.

F. S/S. Para. 2 of Smith‟s letter. Is it accurate?

P.M. There is force in the argument: i.e. if not acceptable to Govt. can‟t be acceptable to people as a whole.

F.S. S. will reject whatever we propose. Therefore must be in right position at point of break. Therefore adopt (3).

M.H.L.G. ? Better to demonstrate S. wholly wrong: therefore adopt 2.

M.O.D. But S. might accept 2 or 3: and if Afr. boycott, we are in v. dangerous sitn. One thing S. won‟t accept is refm – principle of wh. is built into constn as safeguard for entr. cls but will have to go on indepce. Thereafter there will be no means of really preventing wrecking of constn after indepce. 5th principle must be maintained: R.C. wd. put it in commission.

P.M. Boycott not likely.

F. S/S. Agree must stick to R.C: but (2) best – in order to show we dissociate ourselves from proposal &amp; so avoid Munich.

Must be interim report and approval of R.C.‟s methods: and refm as a fall back if a boycott of R.C.

L.Ch. Chiefs valueless. Real motives of Rh. Govt. now clear – no intention of having Afr. majy ever.

If we reject mily intervenn, I will accept P.M.‟s judgment. But 3 or 4 wd. precipitate u.d.i: and Rh. govt. will get away with it, (unless U.N. intervenes) since ec. sanctions won‟t work. Even oil blockade of southern Africa v. doubtful: and v. damaging to Zambia.

S/S. D. Agree: must prevent u.d.i. if possible in order to help Afs.

Accept 2 with fall back on refm – tho‟, if it had to be implemented, wd. give S. best excuse for u.d.i.

Ch. Duchy. Watch posn in wh. we end up. On 2, suppose favourable vote, do we still refuse to enact it here?

P.M. Method of ascertainment has to be agreed first. If so, I wd. take the risk of giving blank cheque – provided if neg. vote we are then free to revert to substantive R.Cn.

M. Techy Watch Afr. reaction.

P.M. Not if we publicly dissociate ourselves from proposal.

C.S. We have conceded indepce before majy rule and no use of force. Therefore whatever course we take, Afr. won‟t be satisfied. But Rh. Cab. now divided – must give time for this to develop. Must therefore avoid u.d.i. and maintain R.C. But on basis of 2.

M.H.L.G. Agree: can‟t abandon R.C. now. But ? paramilitary force: organise this in the 2 or 3 months wh. we are proposing to buy.

P.B.T. I favour 2: but R.C. must produce right answer.

L.P.S. I favoured 3: now not sure.

Ch. Whip. 2 v. difficult to justify to H/C.

M.A.F.F. I favour 3.

A.G. But 3 commits us to make U.K. proposals wh. Afr. won‟t accept. Therefore 2, provided R.C. incorporate device for warning Afr. U.K. don‟t endorse.

Ch. Duchy. Still troubled about our commitment to legislate on basis we don‟t accept, if answer is favourable.

S/S. S. I agree jeopardises our principles: but so does R.C. I favour 2.

P.M. On blank cheque, R.C. report will carry great weight. But we can‟t commit ourselves: nor can he, if answer goes against him and we require, in advance, disavowal of u.d.i.

H.S. I support 2.

L.P. So do I.

M.T. So do I – tho‟, if a u.d.i., I don‟t think Rh. will get away with it. Afrs. and S.U. will intervene.

M.P. Only point is to buy time. But avoid refm – wh. never works in police state.

M.O.D. I oppose 2: S. may accept it and this will damage our image. Refm is one thing S. will reject. If must avoid u.d.i. in hope Rh. morale will crack, why will it crack if u.d.i. will be effective?

P.M. Must avoid u.d.i. – copper shortage here wd. be disastrous.

A.G. If 2, must reserve our ultimate decision on accepting R.C.‟s findings.

P.M. On any view, indepce premature. Must therefore be long period of limited self govt. before indepce – as in Kenya etc.

Balance favours 2 – tho‟ S. may well not accept. If so:-

a) publicly dissociate ourselves &amp; insist Rh. make this clear.

b) R/C. must produce unanimous report on methods, for approval by

Govts.

c) R.C. must take charge of implementn of their findings.

d) if outcome of c) negative, must revive our own conception of R.C. or a constl confce. (wh. wd. make more acceptable to Afr. opinion).

e) refuse blank cheque in advance on acceptance of R.C.‟s findings.

Offer as altve, referendum on Smith‟s proposals with safeguards.

Must announce in H/C. to-morrow, shortly after reply delivered.

Clear up misinterpretn of A.D-H.‟s posn.

Announce M. McDonald as our member: can‟t have H.Cr, who are Govt. servants! (So is McDonald).
