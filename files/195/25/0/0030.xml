C.C. (65) 37 13 July 1965 10 a.m.

1. Future Govt. Business (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip.

L.P. Will circulate phased programme of 4. Papers; no more (apart from Immigration) until mid-August.

F. S/S. Expansionary impact of W.P. on Aid undesirable. Therefore defer.

Ch. Exch. I agree. Even if wording agreed, general impression bad for B/P.

Therefore defer (like Housing W.P.) until after Plan published.

P.M. Get decisions on substance first – at Thursday‟s Cab.

[Enter M.P.B.W: M/S. B/T.

2. Development of Whitehall Area. C.(65) 94.

M.P.B.W. As in memm: biggest issue of M.P.B.W., on wh. many others depend. Long time scale: 1971 earliest date for occupn of new bldgs. on Br. St; 1975 for new F.O; 1980 for reconstrn of Gt. G. St.

Three essentials in para. 4:-

(a) - to reduce traffic.

(b) – may allow 3,000 office personnel: but perhaps only 2,500. Therefore no need for P.Bd. to worry until bldg. designed. But buying and building much cheaper than leasing: must maximise benefits by reserve of accmn in B. St. 10,000 more in Wh‟hall. = 10,000 more in office controlled area: only more economical concentration.

(c) – no more at this stage than feasibility study.

M.H.L.G. Agree in principle: cf. favourable public reaction to feasiby study of Piccy Circus. Agree also on staff numbers.

But present as long-term plan: and be cautious about (unpredictable) traffic implicns.

M/S. B/T. Must not allow policy on Br. St. to appear to favour Govt and so prejudice our stand against private office developers.

F. S/S. Will reluctantly accept, if planned only for 300,000 (even if capable of extension). Therefore delete “generally”.

M.P.B.W. Agreed.

Ch. Duchy. I support: fine archl concept shd. be imposed on traffic.

Ch. Exch. First 2 stages of Br. St. cost £13 m. But not till 1968; and only architects‟ fee until then? I agree on this basis, without commitment on decision in 1968.

P.M. Approve concept in principle. On staff, M.P.B.W. to show how many civil servants in leased accmn in London and at what cost – as basis of correct presentn of scheme. Therefore re-endorse principle of dispersal and agree Martin scheme no derogation – only reconcentrn in Wh‟hall of staff at present

in rest of office controlled area, with economical replacement of leased bldgs. by Govt-owned bldgs.

M/S. B/T. Provided leased bldgs., when vacated are not then occupied by other office workers.

P.M. ? Add (to amended draft statement: circulated) sentence to effect that object will be to concentrate staff in Wh‟hall, without affecting policy of dispersal.

C.S. Omit “subsequently” in sentence about F.O. &amp; C.R.O. – decision on which stands?

F.S. Agree. Implies can‟t begin on F.O. re-housing until Br. St. redevt completed.

P.M. Omit “subsequent”: add – “wh. will proceed as quickly as possible”. This has no implicns qua priorities. Amalgamate first and second sentences of para. 4 and make both “as soon as possible”.

M.T. Traffic problem in W‟minster must be considered in wider context. R‟side tunnel doubtful in terms of value for money. Therefore must be some refce. to G.L.C. and Buchanan.

P.M. M.T. and M.P.B.W. to agree wording.

Diversion of traffic from Parlt Sq. shd. start as soon as possible.

[Exeunt M.P.B.W: M/S. B/T.

[Enter M.L.N.R: Att. Gen: M/S. S.O.

3. Land Commission. C(65) 96, 102, 100 and 95.

M.L.N.R. If progression is to be 40-45-50, effective levy of 15 too low. And must provide some encouragement for land to come forward.

Ch. Exch. Can‟t throw c.g.t. overboard. I.R. advise max. of disadvantage in relying on levy alone. And can‟t expose Govt. to charge of inconsistency: we insisted on comprehensive c.g.t. – can‟t now contract land out of it, or modify whole structure of concessions etc. agreed on Finance Bill. I.R. advise risk of admve chaos qua land owning companies. Since c.g.t. not retrospective, levy will build up gradually and combined effect will emerge only after an interval – wh. is admvely right. C.g.t. at 30% and levy at 30% (deductible for c.g.t.) is combined charge of 50%. That is right.

M.H.L.G. C.g.t. wd. still remain on existing use of land. To split levy on devt value between c.g.t. and levy awkward presentationally. Shd. start low – at say 20%.

And political considns also point to levy as main charge, since it assures some will return to L.A.‟s etc. (not so certain if taken as general revenue).

Ch. Duchy Is levy a tax – i.e. adjusted to individual circs? No – it is claim of State to share of wealth wh. environment, not individual, has created.

M.O.D. I agree: principle at stake is politically important.

S/S. W. I too: can‟t sacrifice principle in Manifesto.

M.L.N.R. Admn difficulties have been examined: and wd. still be there even if levy combined with c.g.t.

F. S/S. I support M.L.N.R: must retain levy, politically, for presentl purposes. Objectives of tax &amp; levy are different: methods shd. therefore be different.

Ch. Exch. V. well. But don‟t overrate redn in price of land or underrate admve difficulties and charge of inconsistency and changing minds.

P.M. Accept M.L.N.R.‟s proposal. On rate, adopt 40-45-50 as incentive to bring forward land. Avoid specific dates wh. wd. encourage bunching.

M.L.N.R. On charities, functional land must be exempt, unrestricted land must be chargeable. But permanent endowment land? Can‟t distinguish by refce to intention of disposal: but is sale by e.g. Eton – on exempt basis defensible?

S/S. E.S. I favour exemption – on political grounds.

Ch. Exch. I agree – charities‟ lobby v. powerful.

H.S. And prior permission of Courts or Chy Cmns (or S/S. E.S.) an additional safeguard – even tho‟ wd. normally be given.

M.H.L.G. But don‟t underrate political difficy of charge that Eton are being exempt.

M/S. S.O. Agree.

Att. Gen. No: must respect practice and precedent qua charities, many of which are small.

L. Ch. Agree: can‟t differentiate between charities.

P.M. Balance of opinion favours exemption.

Absent for remainder of the discussion.]
