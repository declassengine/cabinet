C.C.(65) 45 5 August 1965 10 a.m. H/C.

[Enter Ch. Whip: M/S. CRO: M/S. DEA: Ch. Secy Tsy.

1. Fifty Year Rule C(65) 114.

P.M. As in memm. No need now for as long as 50 years. Compromise of 25 years on half open basis not workable.

Also more publicn of documents: and histories within 30 years not always for publicn.

M.H.L.G. Ex-Cab. Ministers‟ memoirs?

P.M. A separate issue.

H.S. Sensitive personal papers? And L. Ch.‟s right to withhold indefinitely?

P.M. No change.

F.S. 40 better than 30. Some despatches of late „30‟s would be embarrassing. And reduces incentive to historians to co-operate in producing Select Documents.

And is date of transfer to P.R.O. to be reduced from 30 to 15 years? If so, administratively awkward: conflict of uses by historians and Dept.

P.M. Not much risk of embarrassment qua late 30‟s.

Ch. Exch. I support 40: 30 too short for some expectations of life!

S/S. D. No: 25 best, but take 30 as compromise. See Charles Johnston‟s book!

L. Ch. I agree: I can always withhold, wh. will protect F.S.

P.M. More withholding on basis of 30 years than 50: must accept this.

M/S. C.R.O. Must inform C‟wealth: and maintain no release of intra-C‟w. documents without agreement.

And since some documents deposited in P.R.O. on 50 year basis, they must be reviewed before release. Therefore no announcement until legn ready.

P.M. Approve – on basis it will be done over a period.

2. Public Expre: O‟seas Aid. C(65) 118.

Ch. Exch. As in memm.

M.O.D. Accept: but v. tight and I can‟t meet emergencies. And in ‟69-70 a lower %age of G.N.P. than at beginning.

M.H.L.G. Where is corresponding cut?

Ch. Exch. Only £9m. on a cash basis involved. And basic programme reflects commitments wh. can‟t be cut.

M.H.L.G. Remember for next time. An unrealistic basis!

P.M. Maybe: but inherited programmes!

This concludes expre. review: tribute to Ch. Exch. and colleagues.

Ch. Exch. Tribute to colleagues. Agree arbitrary assumptns: but improve in later years.

L.P.S. O‟sea aid v. disappointing in view of our target.

M.O.D. But a cash basis. And stress annual review in public presentn.

P.M. And many other disappointments: and all will be annually reviewed. Hope ec. sitn better next year. [Exit M/S. CRO.

3. Coal Industry. C(65) 120.

Ch. Exch. As in memm: but I opposed it.

S/S. E.S. I support Ch. Exch: only course consistent with disinflationary policy to wh. we have committed ourselves. If a wage/price freeze, opposite wd. be true.

P.M. Must leave that until longer term strategy – import quotas etc. – ready for Cab. at end-August. But coal prices a separate issue.

Ch. Exch. Not wholly separate: confidence in our basic ec. policies is essential.

M.P. Objective is to get Board clear of debt on revenue a/c. by ‟66-‟67. Price increases essential for this. And coal must keep in line with other nat‟d inds. Otherwise all will ask for subsidies.

Economic working must be promoted: and if ec. pits have to carry unec. pits, industry will never be viable and programme of closures will be frustrated.

To defer to Feby will only make worse.

P.M. And if defer, p.i. sitn will be same as now. Therefore to defer is to decide in favour of subsidy.

M.H.L.G. I agree with S/S. E.S. This wd. commit us to a policy, wh. Cab. haven‟t yet agreed save for crisis purposes. It wd. force us into deflation and wd. put an end to p.i. policy. Therefore postpone decision until whole policy reviewed.

[Exit Col. Sec.

P.M. But this isn‟t deflationary: nor are we committed to deflation.

If no price increase, the £35m. has to be found by taxn. What is better? But cd. we defer?

M.P. No: it wd. rule out 1 Sept., and tho‟ not a tragedy, wd. cost £2-3m.

P.B.T. Nat‟d inds. must meet their targets. Price rises are always politically awkward in short term.

M/S. D.E.A. F. S/S. feels v. strongly on p/i. aspect in short term. If increases, must be regionally selective (otherwise demand falls overall); and that wrecks regional policy.

Better to absorb £30m. in write off, even at cost of maintaining interest payments meanwhile. [Exit H.S.

S/S. W. Redn in output target and acceleration of closures has gone well so far. But must be orderly. Price increases will hasten process: v. dangerous. And regional differenn will hit the regions we are trying to help, as will be emphasised in National Plan.

M. Lab. Another blow to p.i. policy – wh. is already so weak qua wages that some showdown inevitable. Don‟t aggravate this prematurely on prices front.

[Exit M.O.D.

M.A.F.F. I agree: and regional differens disastrous to regional devt policy.

M.T. No: same principle will extend to other natd inds. closures programme already approved: and this won‟t be affected by qun whether costs are met by tax payer or consumer.

P.M. Question is when, not whether. Is ‟66-‟67 target of clear balance sheet accepted? If so, price increase before then essential. But when: and how – i.e. regionally?

? Decide to adhere to target: and price increase on 1 Dec.

Ch. Duchy. Defer until ec. strategy under review. But, if no price increase, start of a policy of subsidy and demoralisation of industry.

[Exit P.M.

Ch. Whip. Increase wh. wd. reduce pensioners‟ increase by 8/- politically suicidal.

[Exit S/S. D.

M.P. But can‟t expect ec. pits to carry unec. pits indefinitely.

S/S. S. No increase for four years – because a basic national industry. Any increase politically damaging – and will reduce demand and consumpn. Therefore defer.

P.B.T. But we have endorsed principle that prices shd. absorb costs – particularly if no increase for four years. [Exit M. Lab.

M.A.F.F. But we do subsidise other industries – e.g. white fish.

L. Ch. I support Ch. Exch. in principle – but not in next few months.

F.S. I agree.

L.P.S. I too – leave till after T.U.C. Confce.

L.P. ? Defer till 1 Dec.

M.P. Announcement wd. have to be in Oct. to allow time for Consultve Councils. And it will come on top of normal reversion to winter prices.

M.H.L.G. Defer until after T.U.C. Confce. and after adequate Cab. discussn of whole ec. policy, including wages/prices freeze. Don‟t prejudice in advance.

P.B.T. But it does prejudice – by applying price freeze to coal. We shd. continue our existing price policy for natd inds. until we deliberately change it.

M.P. And Chmn of Board has already publicly foreshadowed price increase.

S/S. E.S. Price increase right in principle. But timing difficult in relation to future ec. policy decisions.

Ch. Exch. Must promote closures and redeployment – wh. miners‟ unions favour. And for industry‟s sake, prices shd. be raised.

From Govt‟s point of view, subsidy will rise at rate of £40m. a year, if we set out on this path.

We have written off £400m: because limit to what economy can carry for coal. On p. and i., we have postponed decision in Feby on these grounds: and it made no difference.

T.U.C. complicn remains. Therefore decide now to increase prices on

1 Dec. Leaves us free to get over T.U.C. and see whether p. &amp; i. freeze practicable.

[Re-enter P.M.

Ch. Duchy. Even decision on 1 Dec. wd. be v. controversial. But can‟t let all justifiable increases wait on p. and i. policy. Otherwise we shall draft into a subsidy policy – v. damaging. And unions will have to negotiate on basis of a deficit – wh. they don‟t like, nor do we, because negotn has to be with Govt., not Board.

M.P. Deferment will slowdown release of labour. ? Damaging to Natl Plan.

M/S. D.E.A. No – no real difference.

L.P. General agt – apart from M.A.F.F. &amp; Ch. Whip – that indy shd. be in balance next year. Otherwise, narrow majy in favour of increase on 1 Dec.

P.M. Then defer final decision on 1 Dec. until 9 Sept. But must then decide – probably in favour. [Exit P.B.T.

4. Local Govt. Finance. C(65) 121.

Ch. Exch. As in memm. Decision on rate rebate scheme can be taken on Queen‟s Speech.

M.H.L.G. If not in short Bill, shd. be in main Bill.

25% is max from L.A.‟s: and we may not get that.

Ch. Exch. Not more than 75% from Exch: and even that not a commitment.

P.M. Agreed.
