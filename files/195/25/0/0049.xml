C.C. (65) 59 10 November 1965 10 a.m.

Rhodesia (oral).

P.M. Considered further: more talks with Beadle.

Rh. Cab. equally divided: S. favours R.Cmn but speaks publicly in different tone.

B. refuses to continue unless emergency moderated as necy. Also “undertakes” not to produce un. report in favour of ‟61 constn. Our member shd. be judge – V. Thomas. That will clinch non-unany. Oppn offer to support Govt undertaking – public or private – to commend un. Report to Parlt. But this implies that, if u.d.i. now and this might have prevented it, Oppn cd. then campaign against Govt, particularly on sanctions, on this ground and turn issue into colour dispute. Cd. be v. serious politically, if copper shortage and unempt.

? Don‟t offer this – but put as a question to the Rh. Govt, on a confidential basis. If S. rejects – so be it. But shd. split the Rh. Cab. and prevent Oppn advantage. Little risk of this happening – since no unany report. But can‟t say no publicly.

Rights of Parlt – important if intervening Sharpeville: but cd. then put to H/C. on motion (? suspending ‟61 constn) condemning Rh. Govt. as irresponsible &amp; unfit for indepce, so refusing to honour our undertaking. Similar let out if S. overthrown and succeeded by e.g. Dupont.

On balance, go ahead with question, reserving right of Cab. to turn question into positive undertaking. But make this offer orally via H.Cr, on basis that discussns with Beadle settle interim report, emergency etc. and that if S. will settle thus he must impose no more condns but appoint Cmr and go ahead. If not, let him come to Malta.

S/S. E.S. If gave undertaking now, R.Cmn cd. at least get on.

If only a question, 50/50 chance of u.d.i. remains. Therefore adopt former?

P.M. But we can‟t accept a unilateral decln of dependence! And if we give undertaking now, he will simply ask for more: he must first commit himself to quid pro quo.

Most likely outcome - maj report against ‟61. But, whichever way, maj report wd. leave all posns reserved. Time gained shd. prevent u.d.i.

F. S/S. Must make some new move – but not so far as S/S. E.S., wh. wd. be unacceptable to liberal opinion. But if a question and S. responds favourably and there is a un. report, we are bound: and in circs. short of extreme – i.e. disregard Sharpeville – we shd. be committed. But if, privately, we are safe, go ahead.

M.O.D. Wd. deal include reservn of Parly approval of interim report on procedure?

And wd. deal itself be subject to Parly approval?

P.M. On latter, must tell Parlt: consider further whether seek approvals.

On interim report, leave to Cmn to decide by majy whether to submit method to Govts. If necy., therefore, cd. probably block at that stage: and emergency makes early interim report likely.

Ch. Duchy We have never defined “acceptable to p. of Rh. as a wh”. Does this mean great majy?

P.M. Never defined. But, if Rh. Govt. reject, they are one important section!

F.S. Question really commits us to accept if S. does. But that is reasonable. Nevertheless, accept we are committed if a un. report.

If S. rejects and goes for a u.d.i., we must publish at once. Important qua Oppn.

Is V. Thomas right? He has been a previous Labour M.P.

P.M. But he is a judge, appointed by a Consve Lord Ch. And he is “worldly” in right sense – wh. is what is needed here.

Other names – Donovan, Devlin, Simon – must be rejected for various reasons. And must be certain our man wd. block un. report. But Devlin wd. carry great weight.

M.P. V. Thomas is essential as our safeguard against un. report.

S/S. W. Agree: watch impact of our proposal on African opinion. Are we committed to legn?

P.M. Yes – rights of Parlt expressly reserved. And Parlt might reject.

L.P.S. On this basis we are abandoning four of our five principles. ? Limit to statement that we wd. hope to be able to commend un. report. Oppn not reliable, particularly if it comes to sanctions.

M.H.L.G. These risks inherent in R.Cmn from outset. No real altve to P.M.‟s proposal.

L. Ch. Quite certain a un. Affirmve report impossible. But can‟t say so publicly. Therefore if we go ahead we risk losing Africans: if we don‟t we risk losing Oppn support if a u.d.i. and sanctions.

But question shd. bind Smith, if he accepts, to settle finally on this basis &amp; go ahead.

M.O.D. Wrong to abandon our principles merely to avoid u.d.i. Therefore, if we proceed on this basis, must bind S. to accept a R.Cmn on our terms explicitly. And Parlt must approve interim report on methods.

P.M. Agree on first point. On second point, leave to Cmn. See new tel: if a u.d.i. we will expose our offer. If our man dissatisfied on method, he can‟t be satisfied on final report – so we are safe.

M.O.D. But un. report not accept. is impossible!

P.M. Yes: but all bets are then off. And we cdn‟t accept majy report.

M.O.D. ? Require claim to be abandoned if R.C. did not submit un. report.

P.M. No: asking too much.
