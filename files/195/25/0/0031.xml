C.C. (65) 38 15 July 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip: M/S. F.O.

L.P. As in statement.

2. Oversea Affairs (oral).

a) Viet Nam.

P.M. H. Davies M.P. returned. No advance on Mission: but Hanoi now understands Western position – for first time! Visit worthwhile.

b) Disarmament.

M/S. F.O. S.U. now say ready to resume negotns in Geneva. Encouraging.

P.M. Yes. A possible prelude to move on V-Nam. But may be response to

U.S. (Gilpatric report): F.O. shd. examine implicns for our own policies, especially qua A.N.F.

[Enter M.P.N.I: M.H: Ch. Secy Tsy.

3. Review of Public Expenditure. C(65) 101, 97 &amp; 98.

Ch. Exch. Useful review: thank for Deptl co-opn.

P.s. expre. to grow at 33%: G.N.P. at 17% - over next 5 years. Correct reversal of previous tendency: but implies private consumpn held back. Addl programmes go to limit of prudence: no further margin and any increases must be offset by reductions.

P.M. Agree: important to reinforce intl confidence and to make Plan credible. But transfer payments? Can‟t say they don‟t count: but must be free to change taxn – as between rates &amp; taxes &amp; without affecting expre plans. Also - a rolling plan: ests. will have to be revised each year – nothing sacrosanct: particularly if under-spending is maintained. Important to put this point across when presenting: avoid strait jacket.

Ch. Exch. Agree. If we can hold next two years, three following years shd. show greater rise in prody than in expre.

F. S/S. Maybe: but Plan itself is optimistic in this respect.

Ch. Exch. Publicn shd. be geared to publicn of Plan, unless some crisis makes earlier publicn necy.

M.H.L.G. Wrong to include public sector housing but to exclude pr. s. as beyond control. Inclusion deprives other Depts: exclusion leaves pr. s. as main beneficiary. But pr. s. is more expensive qua subsidy than pub. sec. But this does not appear in these a/cs at all. Ditto in terms of real resources: and in terms of supply of finance. This is Tory technique – and we ought to change it.

P.M. An illustration of a wider principle. But main point is total target of 500,000 houses – wh. is only credible if some form of starting date rationing more widely than housing: e.g. hospitals v. dance halls. Public sector expre shd. be matched not only with private consumpn but also private sector capital expre.

This means latter must be controlled by refce. to degree of essentiality – i.e. form of building licensing in private cap. expre.

F. S/S. No. See para 54(c) of C(65) 101. Agreed pr. sector must be restrained; only doubt is how.

P.M. But cf. para. 45: pub. sec. is to be the regulator. Inconsistent.

Earlier objns to licensing – reversion to stop/go etc. – irrelevant when Plan available.

M.H.L.G. But see para. 44: doubtful whether practicable to hold pr. housing.

Ch. Exch. I agree in principle with M.H.L.G. But so far Cab. has rejected control over pr. housing: and in that case, given demand for houses for sale, we can only say it will be difficult to restrain pr. housing. If we go now to control, that will be inconsistent with drive for greater house ownership.

P.M. Even so, must decide control in pr. sec. only right if corresponding physical control over pr. sector building, housing and other. We shall need this even if negotns with bldg. socs. succeed qua housing.

F. S/S. Those negotns may not bite: and control over pr. sec. housing may also be needed.

P.B.T. Controls need legn: watch forestalling during interim.

S/S. E.S. It is inconsistent to ration physically while subsidising mortgages and giving tax reliefs.

Ch. Duchy. Same is true qua benefits: much private provision for secy involves charge on resources. Here, too, public provision must not be residuary legater. This problem not so far resolved.

M. Techy Raises v. large issues of emphasis between pu. &amp; pr. sectors in political terms.

P.M. Useful 2R. discussn. F.S. (absent for A. Stevenson‟s draft) wishes to record his dissent on Aid.

Now in detail:-

a) Education.

S/S. E.S. Given lower priority than housing and benefits. Nothing (even in basic) for comprehensive educn, nursery educn, increase in real value of student grants &amp; aboln of parental contribn. Extent of addn depends on cut in sch. meals. Even with this, virtual cessation of sch. bldg., other than bare bldgs. – i.e. nothing for improvements which, under Tories, was given £30m. a year. Univs: can be represented as going back on Robbins, since standstill on univ. devt and improvement. Univy of Air, reform of public schools, N.E. college of techy – all out.

Therefore, given, new bulge, impression will be unfortunate (apart from

e.g. 4th channel financing of Univy of Air).

b) Health and Welfare.

M.H. Basic programme v. tight. So was addl programme. Accept deferment of abolition of remaining charges. Hospital programme vital. But will acquiesce, altho‟ allocn grossly inadequate. Share with Scotland must be further discussed.

c) Benefits &amp; Assistance.

M.P.N.I. E.r. benefits shd. come in Oct. ‟66. If so, simultaneous uprating impracticable – and unnecessary until April/May ‟67 (and then at 10%), costing £240m., for which basic pr. provides.

E.r. unempt &amp; sickness benefits must be matched by something on indl injuries benefit, at least to preserve existing diffl at £2½m. in 66-7 and £5m. in a full year. This can be balanced by saving on basic.

Income Guarantee a firm commitment. Costs £100m. No provision in proposed programme until 1969-70. That means indefinite deferment.

P.M. I.G. shd. be cheaper than flat rate increases, since related to need. Is this so?

M.P.N.I. Modest scheme costs £100m. over &amp; above existing expre. V. little scope for savings on uprating of benefits.

P.M. Cd. I.G. in April ‟67 subsume flat rate increases wh. wd. otherwise be necy?

M.P.N.I. After allowing for chronic sick &amp; widows, saving on “ordinary” pensioners wd. be v. small.

M.H.L.G. But what about w.r. contribns?

Ch. Duchy. The £46m. shd. be covered by this.

Ch. Exch. But any further increase in contribns will reduce private consumpn still further.

F. S/S. And level of contribns already high and a significant element in industrial attitudes to prices &amp; incomes policy – on top of training levy, redundancy levy etc.

P.M. W.r. Scheme was always intended to be financed (more than 100%) by contribns. I.G. must be compared with flat rate increases, in terms of increase in contribn wh. wd. be (realistically) required – without any increase in the 4¼%, or at least leaving that question open until orders of magnitude of increases in contribn are clearer.

We need variants within Group‟s total and related variants of contribn.

M.P.N.I. I.G. was never meant to be based on contribns at all. If so, only means of financing is by depressing, below Tory level, benefit for widows and chronic sick.

P.M. But I.G. was to replace flat rate increases. If these stay, financing of I.G. must be re-examined.

F. S/S. Politically impossible to defer up-rating until spring of ‟67. ? Anticipate by early 4/- or 6/- rather than wait to pressure for 10/-.

I.G. Scheme is changing character: not much more than minor improvement of N.A. Therefore wiser to defer.

P.M Ch. Duchy, MPNI, S/SW, Ch. Secy, MHLG: S/S ES: S/SS shd consider how allowc proposed by Group wd be best spent, how flat rate increases shd be phased; how much IG and f.r. increase wd cost if financed partly by contribns.

d) Police &amp; Prisons.

H.S. Acquiesce – provide I can keep what I have got.

e) Roads.

M.T. Acquiesce – but some addl items must be met from basic. Relief of urban congestion essential.

S/S. W. Must discuss with M.T. reduced programme for Wales.

P.B.T. Total increase too large: more for schools &amp; houses. Otherwise roads programme rises by 42%!

Ch. Exch. Can‟t tamper with basic p‟mme.

P.M. But increases in costs disquieting. And political priority of roads less than social services. Inquiry into costs shd. be put in hand.

M.T. Must allow for increases in land prices. I am conducting comparative survey. We have heavier traffic, and spend less on roads, than any other developed country. And contracts are long-term wh. can‟t be adjusted at short notice.
