C.C. (65) 15 11 March 1965. 10.00 a.m.

1. Capital Punishment Bill (oral).

L.P. ? Accept decision to take Cttee. on floor. Adds 7 days.

Or By resn, send back to St. Cttee. to resume at point where it stopped. ? 1 day for the Motion – and an extended R. Stage, perhaps 3-4 days for R &amp; 3 R.

Or By Resn, take Cttee. on floor on Wed. mornings. But free vote – and must therefore ensure no amdt, since otherwise can‟t avoid R.

Or Drop and re-provide facilities next Session.

I favour morning sittings: but a bore for Ministers, who must be available in order to avoid amdt.

H.S. I agree. Can‟t drop the Bill.

Ch. Duchy. But a pity to adopt innovation in procedure for unpopular Bill.

? Use normal time for this Bill and Wed. mornings for another Bill.

L.P. Cd. send this Bill back to St. Cttee. and use Wed. mornings for

P. Members‟ Bills waiting for St. Cttee. But anomalous to put P.M.s‟ Bills on floor.

P.M. Approve Wed. mornings.

2. Parliament (oral).

L.P. As in Statement.

P.M. Private meeting in H/C. on Steel Bill – with some Ministers present. V. undesirable. Preserve Cab. responsy and solidarity for this Bill.

3. Oversea Affairs (oral).

a) W.E.U.

F.S. Fr. dislikes these meetings: but it went quite well. I repeated my Brussels thesis about co-opn between E.E.C. &amp; E.F.T.A. on specific functional lines. All, except French, responded favourably. I explained our economic measures, wh. were approved (Fr. excepted).

b) Visit to Germany.

P.M. Useful visit. Especially since started in Berlin. G. want some move on reunification: but still sticky on A.N.F./M.L.F. E.E.C./E.F.T.A. collabn was mentioned: and I will arrange for possibilities to be examined as basis for initial approach to E.F.T.A. On S. costs, new initiatives agreed – or else!

c) V-Nam.

P.M. Nothing since my Statement in H/C. on 9 March. Must adhere to this, including call for end of hostilities. Still no response from S.U: but Gromyko‟s visit and F.S.‟s subsequent visit to W‟ton. may clarify. Shinwell‟s Motion shd. be helpful in diverting left-wing pressure: and we must mobilise support for it as a means of preserving Party unity.

M.O.D. Any o‟sea projects to help S costs ought to be co-ordinated with our own aid programmes.

P.M. Agree: co-ordinate with Treasury. But don‟t jeopardise I.M.F. co-opn (on wh. we got specific assurances of support) for sake of S. Costs.

4. Rail Closures. C.(65) 41.

M.T. As in memm. Real oppn is from unions, on loss of jobs. But this is being looked after. Decline in passenger mileage offset by increase in freight mileage. In last 2 years, R. Bd.‟s deficit reduced by £30m. and wage increase of £40m. absorbed. Therefore must maintain policy: block Spearman Bill; and don‟t appear to abandon modernisation.

P.M. Adopt device of blocking proposals before T.U.C.C. stage – and be seen to do it. Also invoke Regional Boards‟ comments before final Minl decision?

F. S/S. D.E.A. have had v. full co-opn from M.T. But I don‟t object to P.M.‟s proposal.

M.H.L.G. We too have had full co-opn. But note that freight service decision (on wh. no consultn takes place) can appear to prejudice consultn on passenger service.

M. Tech. No real improvement in rly. services as a whole. All the improvement has been achieved by sacking. Unions won‟t be satisfied until there is a co-ordinated transport policy before closures take place.

S/S. W. I agree on Wales. More co-ordn of bus &amp; rail services essential.

P.B.T. I endorse suggn for consultn with regional planning authorities.

M.T. R. Bd not v. anxious to co-operate on “early sift” procedure: but will do their best.

I take M.H.L.G.‟s point: But I can‟t intervene in rationalisation of freight services, since this would prevent railways from retaining such traffic as they have. Must allow Bd. to carry freight as efficiently as they can: and this means, in industry of maximum labour-intensity, some redundancy. Don‟t interfere with Bd.‟s managerial responsy.

On regional consultn, I wd. accept consultn in every case if regional councils were all in opn – but preferably before T.U.C.C., since ec. devt considns shd. have priority over passenger hardship.

P.M. I agree – an improvement.

M. Tech. But not merely an economic problem. If it were, soln is to confine to main services. Otherwise, must have a co-ordinated road-rail policy.

No point – if not an ec. problem – in putting to ec. regional councils alone. And unions should participate in management decisions.

M.T. I am not taking decisions on ec. grounds alone. I have said railways, and commuter services, will never really pay if social considns are taken into account.

Ch. Duchy. I agree. Cab. Cttee. tries to take all considns into a/c, including regional ones. Wd. consultn with r. councils be more effective than consultn with D.E.A?

Only new factor is Hinton enquiry: and few of closures wd. be affected by this.

Therefore Cttee. shd. examine proposals in reln to Hinton: and, if no link, consider on merits. If a link, defer closures until H. reports.

But this will make little difference: and no further change wd. be justified.

Ch. Whip. Don‟t underestimate Party dissatisfn on grounds of:-

a) refusal to halt all closures pending Hinton report.

b) disposal of rly. land to private developers rather than L.A.‟s.

c) transfer of work from rly. workshops to private undertakings.

d) lack of means to compete with „C‟ licence holders.

P.M. All Depts. &amp; regional councils shd. be invited to find work for rly. w‟shops. And o‟sea aid might help – in kind. [Exit F. S/S.

M.T. R. workshops to be considered by E.D.C. On land, I have encouraged offers to L.A.‟s. But they can acquire compulsorily, if they want it.

R. Bd. will always co-operate. But if suitable for comm. devt, Bd. can‟t be expected to lose profit. But will certainly do all I can, within limits of our land policy – since can‟t deal with rly. land in isolation from other publicly owned land.

S/S. S. A closure not major at outset may become so in light of Buchanan.

And shd. r. councils have a decisive voice?

M.T. No: their views must be put to me via F.S/S.

On Hinton, a misunderstanding. His job is merely to advise me from time to time on various aspects of transport policy: there will never be a published report.

Better to rely on r. councils.

P.M. Endorse memm, on basis that “early sift” procedure shd. be expedited; r. councils shd. be consulted before T.U.C.C. stage; relevance to H. enquiry shd. be considered at outset.

On r. w‟shops wait for E.D.C. – but consult r. councils here too.

On r. land M.T. &amp; M.H.L.G. shd. put proposals to E.D.C., who shd. then consider policy on surplus land disposal as a whole.

In light of above M.T. to make Parly. Statement as soon as possible.

5. Tribunals of Inquiry. C.(65) 31. [Enter A.G.

H.S. As in memm.

A.G. Doubt need or value of R.C. Some form of inquiry procedure essential: scope for investign is therefore limited to powers, methods etc. Let Ministers concerned examine first: and avoid an unnecessary R. Cmn.

P.M. I don‟t wholly dissent: but don‟t underrate public concern.

Note devt since Vassall affair – technique (in Profumo case) of one-man inquiry, with fall-back on 1921 Act, if necy.

M.H.L.G. And a judge not necy best chairman. ? Reconsider Select Cttee. as a preferable altve.

A.G. No. If an inquiry, shd. be a R.Cmn and a judge in chair. A S. Cttee. much too political and wd. divide on Party lines.

P.M. Without prejudice to this, let Ministers concerned consider with L. Ch. in chair. (H.S. S/S S: L.P: Ch. Duchy: A.G: L. Adv: M.W.P.)

[Exit A.G.

6. Farm Price Review (oral).

M.A.F.F, Unions won‟t agree at +£11m. – tho‟ no histrionics. Therefore I must impose settlement at between +£10m. and +£11m.

Unions wanted 2d on milk (= +£19m.) and £5m. on other guarantees.

We cdn‟t approach this. There will be a row, on milk and cereals: but I can defend it.

S/S. S. Milk wd. have meant ½d a pint for 10 months and 1d for 2 months.

Ch. Duchy. I agree: quite unacceptable.

P.M. Well handled by Ministers. M.A.F.F. shd. circulate a brief for other Ministers who may have to defend settlement – e.g. W. Paper itself, with explany note.
