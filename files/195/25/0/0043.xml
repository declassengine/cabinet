C.C. (65) 51 14 October 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Rhodesia. C.(65) 131. [Enter Ch. Whip: M/S. F.O.

P.M. See records. C‟w. Mission may make Rh. Govt. hesitate: and every day gained reduces risk of u.d.i. If so, they can never bluff us again.

C.S. Agree. Menzies will head Mission (but not alone) if S. accepts. Obote accepts: Abubakar will probably accept: Senanayake considering. Also business/City Mission: shd. moderate local opinion.

P.M. Also intl opinion mobilised v. effectively – particularly U.S.

If Rh. does u.d.i. now, he cuts himself off completely: even S.A. and Port are hesitating. Risks of split in our bipartisan approach reduced by our readiness to discuss and our advice to Rh. to think again. We made no concessions but indicated altves – e.g. a constl confce, closer assocn of Afrs. with govt and admn: i.e. procedural altves but no concession on substance. No sign of further running down of Rh. £ balances.

C.S. Our lead – P.M.‟s broadcast – welcomed in Africa: see Nyerere‟s speech.

P.M. Important to keep public opinion straight on issues. Hence my talk with Oppn leaders – wh. shd. have reduced risk of Party dispute, wh. might develop on racial lines.

But sitn can go wrong at v. short notice. Therefore man all action stations and avoid any public speeches – unless cleared with No. 10 or C.R.O.

2. Local Govt. Finance: Rate Rebates and Rates by

Instalments. C(65) 132. [Enter M.P.N.I.

M.H.L.G. Consider both social &amp; political implicns of proposals. 10% increase in rates last year: 10% this time. Hence proposals geared to next March. Allen report showed impact of rates much harder on incomes of less than £10 a week than on other classes: also 500,000 people cd. have claimed N.A. but refused to. Bill geared to these considerations – early operation; not via N.A.B; and directed to person paying rates. All as a temporary measure, pending radical reform of rating system. Not a social service, but a tax concession. Therefore keep distinct from income guarantee. Cost nearer £25m. than £35m.

S/S. S. Endorse: watch possible implicn of return to local means test – wh. is not so.

M.H.L.G. Where rates combined with rates, adjustment will be made in rent. 25% to be paid by L.A.‟s, as incentive (1d rate on average) to administer conscientiously.

20% of all ratepayers shd. benefit - 2½ m. apart from those offset by N.A.

Ch. Exch. Will benefit mainly places like Bournemouth – little electoral advantage. Also will free incomes for addl demand on resources. Even £25m. a sizeable figure; and, if conceded, others may have to give way – e.g. grants for colliery closures: B. Railways deficit increase; E.L.D.O. launcher; Indian aid; increased housing ; impact of bldg. licensing and deferment of public contracts. All these are additional, since we last settled priorities.

P.M. Some cancel out: more public sector houses justify tighter bldg. licensing in private sector.

Ch. Exch. Doesn‟t follow – we may get both. And the £25m.+ implies either more taxn or more borrowing – i.e. a Budgetary problem.

M.H.L.G. We are politically pledged to shift burden from rates to taxes.

P.M. Agree.

M.P.N.I. I support. But emphasise designed as a tax change, not related to income guarantee – wh. mustn‟t be presented as a means to meet needs. Moreover, it can‟t be financed from my allocn to 1970.

Also emphasise relief via N.A. will continue to be available – avoid duplicn.

On appeal, N.I. tribunals are dealing with appeals against discretionary decisions. No qun of that here: therefore leave to L.A.‟s to work throughout.

S/S. W. Agree on appeals. Some form of appeal indispensable: but leave to L.A.‟s to arrange.

Ch. Exch. Better to postpone whole thing. By time of local govt elections, long-term Bill shd. be going through Parlt: and, although it will start a year later, it will redeem our pledge politically. And it wd. be consistent with our policy of doing things when we can afford them – wh. has paid off.

Ch. Duchy. I don‟t dispute no political loss in postponement. But deferment of inc. guarantee is real reason for action now – i.e. to help people with small fixed incomes, who are “stuck” with big house.

Is £5 too low? And this is a 3rd means test – inc. tax: N. Ass: and now rates rebate. If U.G.C. included, 4! Have admve implicns been worked out – what are modalities of test etc?

M.H.L.G. Mustn‟t refine too much – or it will become a social service, not a tax concession. Therefore go for a simple, workable scheme which L.A.s can administer.

Can‟t allow another 10% increase without some relief – at once, not only in long term scheme.

L.P.S. I wd. support Ch. Exch., if he opposed strongly. Otherwise I endorse proposals, provided they can be incorporated in long term scheme.

M.H.L.G. Yes – probably an inescapable element. And main Bill will be mainly about grants, not rating system, wh. will need several years more research before we can improve its regressive nature.

L.Ch. A crude scheme: full of anomalies: difficult &amp; expensive to administer; and unsatisfy qua appeal. ? Better to wait till next year.

M.P. What about people on bonus schemes, who may exceed £1000 p.a. from time to time? How often will means test be assessed?

M.A.F.F. I endorse proposals.

P.B.T. If to be embodied in main Bill, must provide for periodical revision of limits etc.

C.S. We don‟t know how many will benefit. 2½ m. is only figure of those who wd. be eligible. And if difficult &amp; rough &amp; ready, leave to main Bill.

M.H.L.G. Can‟t face 10% increase on poorest people for second winter running.

Ch. Exch. Not more than 10/-: not v. grave for many families.

M.H.L.G. But grave for poorest families.

M.O.D. And inequitable by criterion of our philosophy of social services that poorest shd. carry a proportionate increase.

F. S/S. Despite difficulties, I am convinced we must go ahead.

S/S. D. Cost to Exch. is directly related to relief of need: therefore go ahead.

S/S. S. Anomalies exist at present – insofar as some people are already being helped via N.A. We are only broadening band of help.

H.S. I agree.

M.T. I too: it will help not only pensioners but also workers. But £5 is arbitrary.

P.M. No political advantage qua local elections – where we shall lose heavily. Qua national election – in May or even in October – more important to protect ourselves against charge of unredeemed pledge.

On merits, regressive system becomes increasingly unfair as rates burden grows. For many people, circs. are no worse despite Ch. Exch.‟s extra demands. But for some, whose incomes do not rise, conditions have deteriorated and standard of living has fallen – cf. Airey Neave‟s case. Strong claim here: and, if done now, must be an interim measure, pending reform of rating system as a whole. Can short Bill include rating of empty properties – new as well as old?

M.H.L.G. Because rating arises only on occupation – and varies according to its nature. V. complicated.

P.M. Confine to residential property?

M.H.L.G. Will consider: but problems on permitted interval etc. But will be in main Bill in Feby – not deferred for reform of system.

P.M. Accept. Endorse proposals, provided reform of system pressed on.

M.O.D. On payment of instalments - ? arrange for rating stamps on sale in P. Offices?

M.H.L.G. Will consider. Some L.A.‟s already operate instalments systems.

P.M. Ordinary savings stamps might do. Examine this – and £5 figure too.
