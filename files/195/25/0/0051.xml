C.C. (65) 61 16 November 1965 11 a.m.

1. Rhodesia (oral). [Enter M/S.F.A.: Att. Gen; Ch. Whip.

P.M. Tribute to inter-deptl machine after u.d.i. Tribute to firmness of Governor. Attitude of R.Rh. Forces uncertain.

Maintaining contact with Rh. quite well. B.B.C. v. helpful.

Enabling Bill enacted without trouble: tribute to Govt‟s Parly leadership in both Houses. Orders should now be made v. quickly - ?use to make worst powers (censorship) illegal – so that editors cd. apply for an injunction!

U.N: not too bad so far. Our resn – and I. Coast resn, wh. goes rather too far, but not too unacceptable and cd. be voted for if necy. No question of veto – at any stage – without refce to Cab. Therefore must accept Ch. 7. language in principle, if necy: but not commit ourselves to any particular action under Ch. 7. Oil embargo shd. be subject of special, quick U.N. study.

C.S. Valuable that Govr shd. stand firm. But, if we press Rh. people too far, shall consolidate them behind Smith.

Staff of Rh. H. questioned on loyalty – or return to Rh. Unfortunately, put into writing, as guidance.

A.G. Even so, unfortunate – since it seemed to invite signatory to condemn himself as loyal to Smith. Awkward in relation to people who may be within reach of criminal law.

M/S.F.A. U.N. debate shd. be followed up by some tour of capitals.

Rh. diplomats attached to our Missions overseas are divided in loyalties. In W‟ton Bentley refuses to surrender papers.

P.M. Press on this: it is our office. Publicise those who have remained loyal.

Ch. Exch. Rh. runs surplus with Z. &amp; M.: deficit with S.A. Blocking of Rh. a/cs in London is therefore embarrassing payment for Z. imports. Rh. now demanding $: I have therefore agreed pro tem to release a/cs for current trade. If necy cd. resort to $ invoicing all round – wh. wd. lead to blocking of balances, wh. we at present only control.

I have also conceded $ for journalists in Rh.

.. .. allowed Br. travellers up to 30 Nov. to settle a/cs in $.

Gifts are banned: and all transfers of capital. Therefore no risk of a pro-Rh. fund in London.

Asbestos – T. &amp; N.‟s cheque being allowed: but sitn will get more difficult &amp; must resolve as soon as poss. Service of Rh. debt held in London (tho‟ not guaranteed) will be a problem.

P.M. Cuts both ways: aggrieved landholders might press Rh. Govt.

Ch. Exch. Agree: must also have list of $-worthy imports into Z. &amp; M. Small interdeptl cttee. to help me.

P.M. Must maintain squeeze via e.g. Barclays DC &amp; O.

Ch. Exch. But don‟t underrate Rh. resources – including printing press. But will explore. But don‟t believe country will break down.

P.M. Continue to press. Also create w-party on oil embargo for briefing U.K. repve on U.N. study.

F. S/S. Must choose between quick death (at whatever cost to Z. &amp; U.K.) or more gradual approach – with risk that we may fail.

P.M. Stay as we are for time being: reconsider when U.N. oil embargo study ready – in 14 days or so. And distinguish between overt moderation and covert toughness – via e.g. banks‟ liquidity.

L. Ch. Avoid unnecy risks on Kariba. And restore secret communicn rapidly.

P.M. Much depends on loyalty of R.Rh. Forces.

M.O.D. Our measures must be cumulative. Mustn‟t let it settle down at level wh. is tolerable to Rh. opinion.

[Exit M/S.F.A: H.S.

2. Prices and Incomes Policy. [Enter Ch. Secy Tsy

a. Armed Forces Pay. C.(65) 144 &amp; 148.

F. S/S. We condemned Consve Govt‟s pay-pause &amp; are therefore vulnerable. But difficult to accept 18% increase (at £50m.) in present circs. Also only pay and might therefore be followed by comparability study on allces.

If can‟t simply reject or simply accept, and since award not operative until April, time for further thought. Therefore refer to N.B.P.I. – not for full scale re-review or to examine Grigg basis but simply to consider award in light of current criteria – particularly recruiting (? for individual grades). If not, must concede award in full, rather than interfere with Forces‟ pay on political grounds. If latter, wd. have to apply throughout public service –

= pay freeze on those whom Govt. has in its power: and, by suggesting posn more critical than in fact it is, it wd. undermine confidence in £.

Ch. Exch. Illustrates difficulty of maintaining a norm and maintaining fair comparisons. We cd. not pay 18% (even over 2 years) in present circs: posn worse than in 1962. Therefore, if refce. to N.B.P.I. (wh. I wd. reluctantly accept) must settle an interim amount and a final amount a year later.

S/S. D. Service pay entitled to separate basis of determination. But biennial large amounts shd. be reconsidered.

Grigg was basis on which people were recruited – an agreement wh. we must honour and not break unilaterally as Consves did in 1962.

Award is to equate, 2½ years later, 400,000 Servicemen with 7 m. civilians.

Allces wd. be subsumed – unless N.B.P.I., when separate claims wd. have to be submitted.

But what wd. Bd. do? If approve, Ch. Exch. won‟t accept. If arbitrary cut, how justifiable? Also no time for board to function on so complicated a structure of rates. How apply concepts of productivity, use of manpower, analogues etc? Therefore don‟t shuffle off responsy to Board: Cab. must decide itself – and we have already raised C.S. pay by 18% since taking office. Refce to Board wd. be v. vulnerable politically, since all my arguments are well known.

Recruiting not reaching target: and uncertainty will be increased by outcome of D. Review.

M. Lab. Refce wd. imply asking Bd. for first time – to settle rates. But it was never meant to be arbitral body. Even railways reserved right to revert to own artibrn tribunal, if dissatisfied with Bd. Must therefore decide by act of Govt: cd. not ask Bd to decide between two Govt. Depts – since M/Def. bound to act as spokesmen of Servicemen who have no trade union.

Col. Sec. I support S/S. D. Can‟t penalise men who have no negotiating power – tho‟ cd. consider how to bring Grigg within scope of Board in future.

M. Techy Accept refce to Bd: no real difference between the 400,000 and the 7m. Difficy arises from impossy of policy, wh. won‟t work unless there is one arbitral body for country as a whole. Therefore we must make up our own minds.

S/S.E.S Can‟t let 18% increase go in present circs. Therefore put it to Bd – and, if so, all other classes incl. doctors, must go there too. Must recognise that, if so, fair comparisons are out – and what do we put in its place?

S/S. S. Not to Bd. Grigg intended to be long-term programme for dealing with pay of personnel who wd. always be several years in arrear.

P.M. But different bases of comparability adopted by different review bodies v. confusing.

S/S. D. No: Grigg is following after 22% increase for c. servants!

Ch. Duchy. Fair comparability classes not yet fitted into our incomes policy. But fair compy is protection against Govt‟s abuse of their own employees. Therefore must decide whether we endorse principle of retrospective alignment or devise a new system of more current alignment. Govt. must retain responsy for defence: therefore no refce. to Bd.

M.P. But introdn of Bd did change rules of game – for whole of industry. And I have deliberately put back wage claims – by miners, elecy workers etc. – in order to put them to Bd.

P.B.T. Bd. shd. review Grigg system. But on amounts Bd can‟t adjudicate between Ch. Exch. &amp; S/S. D. If we decide to approve Grigg increase, must do same for civil servants – or do in stages for both.

M.O.D. I support S/S. E.S: refce. to Bd no more difficult than for industry as a whole. Can‟t hope to alter mental outlook of industry if we are always making exceptions.

S/S. W. I agree: future of Govt. depends on making p. &amp; i. policy work.

L.P.S. I support Ch. Exch.

M. T. But Govt. must keep control of pay of Forces. And argt of catching up is strong on merits. If to be less than 18½%, Govt. must so decide.

P.M. Cab. evenly divided: dilemma of fair compy and p. &amp; i. policy. Danger of changing rules at last stage of 2 year operation (even tho‟ rules must clearly be

reviewed). And different bases of compary are baffling – shd. N.B.P.I. have a study of this?

I would refer to N.B.P.I., on basis of accepting their findings but emphasising Govt‟s moral commitment. And must be last exercise of this kind, pending review of Grigg system.

[Exit M.O.D.

F. S/S. Accept moral commitment: and absence of union etc. But other argts. are irrelevant and unfair if we take p. &amp; i. policy seriously. We started gently to get policy launched: but “interference” with arbitral bodies was implicit from start – and is being exercised now, as M.P. has pointed out. And other examples – via prices as well as wage claims. I have regretted giving way on postmen &amp; teachers: can‟t risk this one. If we let it go, must have either freeze in public sector or severe deflationary policy. Must therefore find middle way – as I have proposed.

M. Lab. I want Bd to be ultimately an arbitral body: but for this award must have regard to moral commitment.

S/S. D. But no time for Bd to do a real job. And compary is in T. of R. of Bd, as one relevant factor. Refce. to Bd wd. therefore provoke political row. Therefore keep decision in Govt‟s hands – and cut amounts, if necy., provided analogues‟ pay is not increased at same time.

Ch. Exch. I support F. S/S. entirely. Only altve is a defly policy. Deptl Ests. at present show rise of 11%!

I accept moral commitment: but Services are not oppressed, by comparison with e.g. people on „M‟ rates.

? Concede 7% from April (= 3⅓% p.a.) &amp; refer issues to Bd – tho‟ I cldn‟t bind myself in advance to accept result.

F. S/S. I wd. accept – much same as for railwaymen (tho‟ they have retained right to go to their own arbitl body). Otherwise, I revert to my original proposal.

P.M. Let F. S/S., Ch. Exch. &amp; S/S. D. explore further before Thursday.
