C.C. (65) 60 11 November 1965 10 a.m.

1. Rhodesia (oral).

P.M. Message sent as agreed. I later spoke to S. &amp; rehearsed our offer, stressing agreement on virtually all points and pressing for immediate R.Cmn. Senior Minister to visit S‟bury to ratify. He accepted all points met – but said, if no un. report, continue as we are ? Then said posns irreconcilable! Only expln decision for u.d.i. already taken. S. said minority favoured this but majority wd. decide: I asked him to assert himself. He said I had done everything possible. (Conversation recorded.)

Just possible he may split his Cab: but S. reported as seeing Govr now to announce u.d.i. &amp; will publish on a broadcast at 11.15. All news channels will then be controlled.

If so, must make statement in H/C this p.m. Minl broadcast to-night (keeping clear of polling hours at Erith).

? Introduce Enabling Bill forthwith – if only for psychological reasons.

L.P.S. Lords may reject! Oppn Peers shd. be warned that, if so, end of Lords.

L.P. ? Present today: take on Monday. Allow weekend for our case to register with public opinion.

A.G. Power required to suspend legre [and to dismiss Ministers: no].

S/S. W. Don‟t give Oppn week-end to mobilise, especially in Lords.

P.M. Best weapon in Lords is Oppn co-opn in Commons. Don‟t bounce Commons &amp; so prejudice this. And don‟t appear to hurry into a situation of sanctions &amp; atrocities.

Ch. Exch. Agree, leave till Monday – particularly if we block £20m. balances &amp; so shake confidence in £. ?If we block take specific powers in En. Bill rather than act under existing legn, esp. since balances are Bank R., not Govt. R.

P.M. Prompt action against balances of usurper Govt. might reassure e.g. Kuwait. Other ex. control measures shd. be taken forthwith: suspend judgment on blocking, subject to quick intervenn if a drawing. Might be wiser to keep £ balances as retaln against any sequestrn of U.K. assets in Rh.

May have to intervene to preserve law &amp; order: but not an opposed landing. But watch risk of Rh. attack on Zambia, and don‟t provoke it by any pre-emptive bid to e.g. control Kariba.

Must be ready to cope with U.N. at once: F.S. shd. be ready.

F.S. For P.M. himself?

P.M. I can‟t spare ten days for Secy Council. F.S. shd. go even if it means he can‟t speak in Deb. on Address to-morrow.

A.G. Even tho‟ Queen can dismiss Ministers, S. of S. can‟t – without En. Bill – take any executive action. Shd. we appear helpless over week-end while rebel Govt. make objectionable Orders? [Enter M.H.L.G.

P.M. But we can‟t do anything effective. Still better to hold En. Bill till Monday, in order to carry Oppn: and then try to pass in both Houses by 7 p.m. on Monday. Be free to publish all letters, records etc.

Cab. must delegate execve action to O.P.D., subject to refce. to Cab. if necy.

2. Rhodesia: Enabling Bill. C.(65) 149.

P.M. As in memm. ? Adopt compromise Affirmve procedure.

C.S. If Oppn will oppose, foolish to give them chance to oppose at all stages. Get the row over now in one bite and insist on Negve procedure.

L. Ch. I now agree with A.G. – if it will ensure Oppn co-opn.

S/S. E.S. I agree.

L.P. Depends on extent of Oppn co-opn. If they will play, I support A.G.

If not, I support C.S.

P.M. We will negotiate with Oppn on this basis.

3. Rhodesia: United Nations (oral).

P.M. Agree F.S. shd. go v. quickly. Must keep control of wilder elements, by trying to divert pressure for mily intervenn into oil sanctions.

Depts. should consider urgently.

[11.18 a.m. Announced Reuter report that Rh. declared herself indept.]

M. Techy Explore chances of T.U. action to enforce oil blockade.

4. Parliament (oral).

L.P. As in Statement – without prejudice to changes required by Rh.

P.M. Public speeches on Rh. shd. be sombre and responsible, without any Party political bias. Remember cd. be start of 3rd world war – between white &amp; black: but avoid saying so. Normal life shd. go on.

S/S. W. Express Cab.‟s apprecn of P.M.‟s handling of Rh. sitn.

5. Earnings Related Short-Term Benefits C.(65) 145.

[Enter M.P.N.I: Ch. Secy Tsy.

M.P.N.I. As in memm.

M.O.D. Have we met criticisms that our proposals encouraged contracting-out; that prod. scheme is a swindle: and that beneficiaries are being milked to save Exch. – at expense of low wage earner contracted out?

M.P.N.I. On third point, contribn reduced by 4/10d and new benefits. A step towards proper co-opn between State &amp; good occupl schemes.

S/S. E.S. Para. 3: concurrent considn admvly impossible.

P.B.T. Will Exch. be meeting higher proportion of cost than under Consve grad. scheme?

M.P.N.I. No.

M.T. But proposals will put extra burden on natd inds. – i.e. ultimately on Exch. And higher contribns will provoke demands for higher wages – i.e. further demand on Exch.

M.H.L.G. No real benefit to local govt employees, who may even be penalised by flat rate abatement.

M. Techy Note critical attitude of T.U.C.

M.H.L.G. Does it mean a redn in total pension benefit for lower paid local govt employees?

Ch. Duchy. All depends on level of abatement – on wh. Staff Side have not yet been heard.

H.S. Same point arises on police and fire services – whose occupl schemes are more generous than most. Recruitment wd. be affected if they thought this wd. be diminished.

M.P.N.I. T.U.C., tho‟ v. concerned about public service occupl pensions, agreed scheme cd. not be tailored to their exclusive benefit. Point is not for me but must be pursued thro‟ ordinary negotiating channels.

M. Techy But proposals are a worsening of terms of service for ⅓ of working popn.

F. S/S. Either let drafting of Bill proceed while Ch. Secy sorts out implicns for public sector: or do latter first. Adopt second course: and Ch. Secy to make further report before decision.
