C.C. (65) 31 20 May 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip: M/S. F.O.

L.P. As in Statement.

P.M. Need for full Minl support in H/C. for Finance Bill Cttee.

.. .. renewed attempt by Ministers to let No. 10 machine know in advance of political speeches in the country.

If Lords reject War Damage Bill on Tuesday, shd. invoke Parlt Act (i.e. renew next Session) and meanwhile make no Exch. payment.

L. Ch. Is this tenable if judgment given in Oct. in favour of claimants? I must consider.

2. Oversea Affairs (oral).

a) Dominican Repc.

M/S. F.O. Fighting continues. Military junta in the lead. Repve of Sec. Gen. in place. L.B.J. has sent a mission to D. to report - ? attempt to disengage.

Carodon is backing O.A.S. initiative and U.N. authority. If O.A.S. intervenn is to be brought under U.N. auspices, we can‟t oppose, even if U.S. object.

P.M. U.S. now beginning to realise they have blundered. Hence mission! We must adhere to line that, tho‟ original intervenn necy to save lives, we can‟t support distortion of Monroe Doctrine to impose a particular form of Govt. by force and must henceforward back U.N. Have made this clear, privately, to U.S: and must press if U.S. continue to resist U.N. authority.

Col. Sec. Must resume Cab. discussn of foreign policy as a whole.

P.M. Yes – after.

b) Cyprus.

C.S. Mak. resisting any attempt to settle by Gk./Turk. discussns and has asked for return of U.N. mediator to Cyprus.

Must support renewal of mandate on 26 June.

c) Viet Nam.

M/S. F.O. Temporary suspension of U.S. bombing: but all messages to persuade N.V.N. to use this chance to negotiate were rejected. No disposn on Comm side to negotiate on V.N: only other means is Cambodian confce. Sihanouk now agrees invitations may issue, if represn also agreed.

d) German Support Costs.

P.M. Will have to consider collectively before Ch. Secy visits Bonn. G. may seek to postpone till after Election: we must resist and deal toughly.

[Exit M/S. F.O.

[Enter A.G: Parly Sec. M/L.

3. Race Relations Bill: Conciliation Machinery C.(65) 72.

H.S. Bill has had mixed reception: probably, therefore, about right! But must make some concession to desire for conciliation machinery and doubts about appropriateness of criminal sanctions. Hence my proposals.

A.G. Better to keep criminal proceedings – short, sharp sanction. Enforcement based on contempt proceedings doubtfully effective. But, if adopted, exclusion of right of victim to sue even more objectionable departure from ordinary principle of common law. This was observed in recent legn on restrictive practices; and risk of flood of actions can be exaggerated. Might offset by requiring any plaintiff to refer to conciln machinery before right of action arises.

Proposal that Board shd. initiate proceedings in county court also doubtful: proceedings about public rights shd. be initiated by A.G. (as Ld Adv. is insisting in Scotland) and bad for Board‟s main function if it appears on occasion as a prosecutor.

L. Ch. U.S. practice shows local conciliation can be effective. Board will not do conciliation: therefore no real objn to their prosecuting, in light of comparative informn collected from concn cttees. nation wide.

M.O.D. I agree. Try concn first: then adapt criminal procedures.

L.P. Can‟t conciliate under duress – i.e. if victim, having failed at concn, cd. institute criminal action.

H.S. Must be civil: interested Labour M.P.s agree. Criminal wd. exacerbate appeals to police and, by attaching stigma to defendant, aggravate public feeling on racial relations. Criminal proceedings not compatible with concn. Incitement different – a public offence: hence criminal sanctions provided by Bill. Don‟t confuse personal rights with public order. Proposals acceptable to Oppn: and too late to change now.

P.M. Compare evictions?

A.G. Under present law, sanction is contempt (tho‟ to be criminal under new Bill): also under restricve practices. I don‟t press my point.

P.M. Approve civil proceedings. On extension to housing &amp; empt?

A.G. We shall be pressed to allow concn cttees. to operate here.

M.H.L.G. It wd. raise v. large problems on council housing if we allowed a non-elected concn cttee. to overrule elected council.

H.S. I have made it clear that Bill is concerned only with public order: and I can repeat that concn cttees. must be restricted to this, even if possible later to give them some functions in wider fields.

M.O.D. But it is in housing and empt that discrimn is most acute.

P.M. In empt, it is on promotion not recruitment, that discrimn bites: and little scope for concn (let alone legal proceedings) here, particularly since unions, like L.A.‟s, are elected bodies on whom we can‟t superimpose a non elected body.

Parly Sec. Agree: must leave industrial relations to existing M/L. machinery, wh. can

M.L. deal with them and is dealing with them by methods which don‟t go as far as jailing 4,000 men – all experience, on strikes etc, show this sort of sanction impracticable and ordinary persuasion is both preferable and effective in conditions of full employment.

F. S/S. I agree. Concn cttees. shd. be confined to job wh. they have some chance of doing successfully.

M. Techy I agree. Objn is often not colour but cheap labour in relation to wage claims. No concn cttee. cd. deal with that.

Col. Sec. I agree.

P.M. Exclude housing &amp; empt. Right of plaintiff to sue?

L. Ch. No: he won‟t have suffered any “harm” and inappropriate to action for individual damages.

P.M. Agreed no personal right to sue. Who prosecutor – Board or A.G?

S/S. W. Bad for Board‟s public image to appear as prosecution. And Scots analogy relevant.

H.S. But Bd. is not itself conciliating: it manages conciln cttees. and considers what shd. be done where they fail.

A.G. At that point it is a matter of asserting public policy – a matter for A.G.

S/S. S. New for A.G. to act in civil matter: cf. a Regional Hospital Board, who wd. use their own solicitor. But A.G. defensible in matter of public order.

F. S/S. Better to let Bd. do it; accept illogicality of Scots posn.

C.S. I agree qua C‟wealth relns.

M.O.D. So do I.

A.G. Under Restve Practices Act, Registrar prosecutes but in my name.

P.M. By narrow margin – A.G. wins.

4. Salaries of the Higher Judiciary. C.(65) 76.

F. S/S. Substance now agreed: but refce. to Cab. in view of political importance. Deferment of effective date is worth little extra cash. Timing of announcement and introdn of Bill for subsequent considn.

L.P. Cd. introduce at beginning of next Session (if this Session ends in July): enactt wd. still be in time?

F. S/S. Breach of faith. Better to introduce in July and let it take its chance in light of our Sept. decision about leg. progr. as a whole.

P.M. Defensible in terms of percentage increase since 1958.

M.O.D. Must surely defer announcement till after Summer recess; otherwise politically v. damaging.

P.M. No: timing is same as for Steel Bill. Judges &amp; Ld. Dithorne can be told confidentially. [Exeunt A.G: Parly Sec. M.L.

5. Televising Parliamentary Proceedings. C.(65) 75. [Enter P.M.G.

L.P. Select Cttee. proposal bypassed by Publications Cttee‟s proposals. Otherwise, as in my memm.

P.M. But change in mood coming: don‟t be too negative – otherwise real Parly debates will be replaced by popular T.V. Parly programmes.

S/S. F.S. I still oppose.

P.M. So do some others – but not all! Proceed as I said.
