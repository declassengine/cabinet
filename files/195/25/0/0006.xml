C.C. (65) 12 25 February 1965. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip

L.P. As in Statement.

2. Oversea Affairs (oral).

a) S. Viet Nam.

F.S. Proposed to S.U. privately that we shd. invite Powers to state views on conditions of settlement. S.U. coy: meantime a minor leak. If S.U. remain coy, we may have to publish initiative.

In S-V.N. Khan despatched to present S.V-N.‟s case to world. Identity of Govt. now uncertain – adds to U.S. perplexity, particularly in view of S.V-N. P.M.‟s latest statement about war weariness.

b) Aden.

Col. Sec. No prospect of new Govt. in Aden in near future. Therefore give time for dust to settle – but emphasise long postponement of constl confce. undesirable.

3. Housing Programme. C.(65) 26, 28, 29, 32 &amp; 33. [Enter M.P.B.W.

M.H.L.G. As in memm on physical &amp; financial controls on private house building. Large potential for indd bldg: and 2/3 cd. be concentrated in areas of greatest social need – apart from Wales. Here ultimate answer may be R.T.B. steel house: meanwhile supply from B‟ham area. No implicns for Budget for 2 years: burden on economy negligible for 9-12 months, by which time economies of manpower by indd bldg. shd. materialise. (And anyhow not more than 1% addn). Only public housing is both relatively &amp; absolutely at lower level than in last Labour Govt: all other social services have gone ahead. Therefore leeway must be made good &amp; we must start now. Need for houses to rent is paramount; and differential interest rates impossible without some form of control.

[Enter M. Techy

M.P.B.W. 12,000 houses means 12,000 men and £40m. by tradl methods.

By indd methods 9-10,000 men; and increased prody shd. be at least 5%, perhaps 7%. Therefore proposal is within capacity of industry.

Ch. Exch. Can‟t resist plea in isolation. But total load on economy? Already a slowing down in pace of completions and even 1% addn is serious. Therefore diversion (= control) essential – and for diffl interest rates. I cd. arrange finl control by C. of B. Order, amended; altho‟ physical controls wd. be more effective.

What about publicity? (Para. 8 of C(65) 26). ?Restrict circular to L.A.‟s in worst areas.

Defer decision until comprehensive review: and then give priority to public housing.

S/S. S. Tenders approved in 64 II lowest for 10 years: and this will show in redn in bldg. activity in Scotland. Tenders approved in our first quarter are highest for 10 years. We are pressing indd bldg: and we are organising a crash programme of slum clearance. Lead on bldg. indy less in Scotland: and little

private h‟bldg. Therefore we do not need to control it – indeed, shd. encourage it.

P.M. Must have effective control over private sector. Addn of 1% to total bldg. load must be accommodated somehow. See paras 4-5 of C.(65) 29 – licensing of private houses above specified size limits. Also other bldg. in para. 8 – less essential than housing. Also license office bldg. outside London? Stop demolition of housing, except for slum clearance. This “stop” – if coupled with “go” on 4 year programme of public housing – is defensible and shd. not damage morale of bldg. industry.

M.P.B.W. Morale is v. sensitive, particularly in unions. Therefore presentation v. important and limits must be carefully considered. £5,000 not much for a house nowadays.

S/S. W. In Wales L.A.‟s co-operate in giving priority to housing for miners. Therefore we must help them to meet other demands.

Ch. Duchy Licensing implies capacity of constr. Indy is limited. Is this so?

P.M. If its prody increases, licensing can be eased. In any case it shd. be differentiated regionally and locally. But without it National Plan and regional plans won‟t work.

F.S/S. I support M.H.L.G. There is some spare capacity in some areas; and extra load on indy in 1965 is negligible. Report on mechanics of control available in a few weeks. ?Defer decision until then. Preferably concede 12,000 now.

M.P. Watch N.C.B.‟s needs: must continue to be catered for.

P.B.T. Must concentrate on areas where resources are underemployed.

Keep quiet in public about extension beyond London of control over office bldg. And remember that legn on bldg. controls will stimulate private bldg. in interim.

Also, road programme is a competitor – including demoln of houses: and this shd. be re-examined.

M. Techy Politically must support M.H.L.G. And stop demoln of houses, wh. attracts and keeps idle, bricks etc. for eventual reconstrn. And note strain on B/P. by imports of fittings etc.

[Enter M.A.F.F.

L.P. Leg. progr. overburdened already. If a Bill to control private bldg., something must make way. And don‟t block Land, Rents &amp; Steel Bills finishing in Commons by 30 June.

P.M. Must review leg. progr. soon, as prelude to Cab. discussion.

Ch. Exch. Avoid publicity for extra houses, at least until end May: and draft circular to L.A.‟s accordingly. And emphasise export aspects of indd components etc.

P.M. Approve 12,000: emphasise value of control &amp; 4 year plans (incl. indd methods) for intl confidence.
