C.C. (65) 36 8 July, 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip.

L.P. As in Statement.

2. Oversea Affairs (oral).

a) E.E.C.

F.S. Fr. pressed advantageous agrl proposals, wh. Five offset by increased supra-naty. They may concede: but prob. part of Fr. effort to thwart majy voting (due 1 Jan. next).

Bad for Keny Round: therefore don‟t gloat. But, if they show any inclinn to reopen Br. entry into CM - we must be ready.

b) Iraq.

F.S. Conflict between Arif and pro-Nasserites. Risk of coup in Baghdad. May delay ratificn of new agt with oil companies.

c) V. Nam.

F.S. Harold Davis en route from Vientiane to Hanoi: probably not accompanied by F.O. official. If so, must be accompanied by Consul General in discussions in Hanoi.

P.M. Must continue to press purpose of this Mission. No prospect of relaxn of hostilities otherwise.

[Enter M.H: Parly Sec. D.E.A.

3. Commonwealth Immigration. C(65) 90, 91, 92 &amp; 93.

L.P. As in memm. Take members first. our Committee proposed 7,500 p.a. in A &amp; B (about 1,500 less than actual of aliens in ‟64 – a heavy year). Also 1500 Maltese under commitment: how related to 7,500?

This compares with 20,000 p.a. at present and 10,000 proposed by M‟batten Mission. In addition allow for dependants on basis of 5:1 ratio. Already 500,000 entitled to come in.

H.S. Concur in 7,500.

C.S. 10,000 wd. be better: 7,500 only if 1,500 Maltese wholly additional.

M. Lab. Accept 7,500. But 1,500 Maltese may lead to trouble with other C‟w. countries.

F. S/S. On economic grounds admit as many as we can. 10,000 wd. not be excessive and wd. not create greater social problems than 7,500.

Col. Sec. Must not be harsher to C‟w. citizens than to aliens or adopt purely self-interested motives. Must encourage two way traffic. 10,000 right, and shd. include about 1,000 for dept territories.

M.H.L.G. Must recognise special obligation to Malta. But in total, be careful qua housing pressure on L.A.‟s. Therefore accept 7,500.

Parly Sec. In main areas concerned – London, W. Midlands &amp; W. Riding – feeling

D.E.A. now very intense: and L.A.‟s can‟t cope. But need for productive manpower v. great. Therefore conflict: but social considn shd. prevail.

M.O.D. Must base policy on extent to wh. social services can assimilate immigrants. But if 7,500 is limit on C‟w. immigration from this point of view, aliens must be cut too. And must not merely cream off what we want – techl assce in reverse: must choose categories in terms of needs of countries sending the immigrants.

Ch. Exch. Must allow time for psych. adjustment: don‟t press too hard too fast. Given shortage of 400,000 manpower for Plan, difference between 7,500 and 10,000 not significant: but accept 7,500 and, if necy, Maltese as extra.

H.S. Limit of aliens v. difficult.

M.P. Dependants more important – on basis of 5:1 – than immigrants.

L.P. On depts, distinguish between the 500,000+ entitled to enter on existing basis and these related to the 7,500 or 10,000.

Views divided: a year‟s moratorium: limit depts to wives and children under 16 but no more: and other proposals.

On 500,000, shd. require immigrants here to state who they are, to limit to wives and chn, to check locally and to admit these. Compassionate exceptions. (?Add stipn about availability of housing – but on what scale?) System wd. be mainly automatic, with discretion to H.S. and some assurance by L.A.‟s about housing.

But H.S. feels all 500,000+ must be allowed.

H.S. My own speeches &amp; M‟batten‟s statements commit us to admit 500,000 under S.2. of C.I. Act. Can‟t import conditions retrospectively – espec. housing wh. might keep wives out for 5 or 6 years.

But wd. accept new legn to remove staty entitlement after 1.10.‟65 and to put depts on same discrety basis as aliens‟ depts. Little immediate impact: but useful safety valve in future, since wd. enable us to impose conditions, if necy.

Must prevent evasion – by power of repatrn during 5 years before full citizenship: and by power to require registrn – to be used sparingly: and discrety depts under Sec. 2. shd. not be admitted except in cases of serious hardship.

S/S. E.S. I wd. require proof that reasonable accmn is available.

C.S. Can‟t be as restrictive as H.S. proposes, without public outcry. And checking of registrn in other countries impracticable. Therefore stricter control of passports better.

M.H.L.G. Cd. not introduce housing stipulation at once – tho‟ perhaps in time, when we have national legn for registration of multi-occupation. I therefore endorse L.P.‟s proposal that in future some evidence of genuine dependency be provided – and do this at once, for existing 500,000. And must be extended to aliens, if necy.

H.S. Agree, so long as housing stipn is not extended to existing 500,000.

P.M. ? Require immigrants here to produce own passport and have depts‟ names inserted at home before they leave.

H.S. Not effective in countries where local records are imperfect.

Ch. Exch. And might encourage inflow by providing incentive to put names on passports.

I agree with H.S. on repatrn: and with S/S. E.S. &amp; M.H.L.G. on accmn.

P.M. ? Any altve use of passports to check evasion.

H.S. None that we don‟t use already.

P.M. Agree depts of existing immigrants shall have automatic right of entry on basis of wives and children under 16 alone. Present it this way, subject to tougher inquiry to prevent evasion: but it will amount in fact to 500,000. Tougher inquiry must provide reasonable measure of verification of authenticity – e.g. reputable signature to endorse photographs i.e. approve (6) of para. 17.

H.S. Breach of faith &amp; impracticable. And legn necy if certificate is to be a condition of entry.

[Exit F. S/S.

P.M. No: no legn needed if “enable” is merely permissive, not mandatory. In addition adopt L.P.‟s proposal for registrn of depts – perhaps, in case of new cases, on application for job. H.S. to work out scheme on basis of no legn except perhaps for future immigrants.

On (7) ?

C.S. Object: M‟batten proposal better.

M.H.L.G. No: (7) is only discretionary and will be used only in exceptional cases.

P.M. Agree: include photograph. Endorse (8).

Registrn of multi-occupied houses shd. now be mandatory. But can‟t require standard of accmn as condition of entry: registrn only a step towards this. Endorse (9) – on basis of 6 months period.

On (10) ?

M.H. Local check useless. Better to include health check among conditions wh. H.S. is now to be allowed to impose.

L.P. Have both – cert. from home country, where possible, plus check on arrival (for all immigrants, whether C‟w. or otherwise) and requirement to accept treatment, if necy.

P.M. Dispense with check on arrival (too elaborate) but requirement to accept treatment where need subsequently established.

On numbers – 8,500 announced, including 1,000 from Malta but without any apportionment for individual countries (including Malta &amp; dept. territories).

? Also dispense with categorisation by trades – i.e. dispense with A &amp; B.

L.P. At risk of reintroducing C?

M.O.D. Yes, even if only minimally – in order to accommodate Malta &amp; dependencies and to avoid charge of “creaming” and reverse techl assce.

P.M. But some of admissions under A are unskilled – provided they have a job.

[Absent for remainder of discussion.]
