C.C.(65) 46 1 September 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Prices and Incomes (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip: Parly Secy M/H.

P.M. £ improved during August; and B/P stronger – July exports a record. Deficit in ‟65 may be less than £300m. In ‟66, if surcharge retained, may achieve balance earlier than expected. This prospect should soon reduce speculation. Other ec. measures also now beginning to bite; but unempt still less than a year ago and some areas still overheated. Even so, developing slack in economy gives us scope for devt of our policies – e.g. in housing etc.

But risk of specve pressure remains – if only in flurries: and our reserves can‟t cope with much of it.

On p. &amp; i. policy, we have already hinted publicly at statutory basis. Essential that improvement in B/P shd. not be endangered by rise in costs. Equally important to avoid rise in C/L qua political impact. Must therefore avoid wage-cost inflation and be ready to anticipate unnecessary price increases. Also desirable to reinforce growing intl confidence in £, wh. can now command support against speculation if other Govts are convinced that we intend to maintain our improvement. Hence our proposals. (Circulated.) They cd. be the foundation of a new and realisable attempt to implement our policies without fear of specve pressure.

Ch. Exch. Agree. £ stronger: even so, can‟t relax on efforts to improve B/P – reserves insufficient and borrowing potential not available. But 4th Q.‟s figures shd. be encouraging. Mustn‟t jeopardise this: unempt still v. low – only 280,000 in August compared with Budget est. of 350,000.

Other central banks opposed to devaln of £: and nothing in our sitn now would justify it. We now have our first chance to go forward.

F. S/S. Not so optimistic, unless we begin selective reflation fairly soon.

Watch this qua public presentn of Plan.

P. &amp; i. proposals are justifiable on merits. Existing policy working better than many suppose. But effects can‟t be quantified: and the 8% rise to April ignores fact that policy didn‟t start till later. Now important, while retaining voluntary basis in sense of avoiding statutory freeze, to put teeth in policy by enforcing delay before point of decision. Sanction v. difficult. Fixing manufacturer for price increases relatively easy: fixing unions v. different. But sanction must appear to apply to both sides.

Even T.U.C. know little about wage claims: therefore early warning system will reinforce their authority. Ditto qua employers, who have so far had no incentive or encouragement to resist unreasonable settlements. Therefore policy must not apply only to public sector.

Proposals are altve to further deflation, wh. might otherwise be pressed on us. And they are the only altve to a complete freeze, wh. is unrealistic on both practical and political grounds.

Neither side of indy will accept args on merits: both insist on its being linked with urgency of immediate financial sitn. Must act now, since can‟t let T.U.C. Congress meet in ignorance of our intentions. Hope they will come along, if we present publicly in appropriate way.

M. Lab. I agree – especially qua T.U.C.

P.B.T. July exports show underlying trend upwards now that our measures are beginning to reduce pressure on economy. But mustn‟t relax; Sept., Oct. and Nov. can be difficult. Defer any discussn of relaxn until then. Therefore I endorse new proposals: qua prices, difficult to decide which prices shd. be notified – Ministers will have to be given power to promulgate by O-in-C.

F. S/S. Coal prices issue must be referred – like other prices – being deferred in the interim.

M.P. Delay means higher deficit, wh. accumulates rapidly. Decision on priority of reference therefore important. Target policy not reconcilable with delay.

P.M. Other similar problems – e.g. on rents etc. But essential to establish concept of price stability.

M.H.L.G. Can we assume no more deflation if specve pressures on £ develops again.

P.M. Measures shd. prevent it from developing. C/L. has risen less here than in most countries: if we can reinforce this, further crises shd. be averted. If B/P. goes wrong again, we shd. have to deal with it by restraining imports. But that wd. be direct action – not action to recreate confidence, wh. ought to be relatively safe hereafter.

Ch. Exch. I cd. not conscientiously propose further measures of “job-destruction”, as distinct from normal regulation of economy or specific measures to help B/P e.g. by mobilising securities etc.

M. Techy If voluntary p. &amp; i. policy is working, why must we do more – at v. short notice because of T.U.C? What about dividends? Unions won‟t accept proposals if dividends escape.

Ch. Exch. C.G and Corpn taxes will be effective here. Latter is already causing issues to be on fixed interest basis. And ec. climate won‟t be propitious to dividend increases. But, if they occur, Budget can deal with them.

F. S/S. Dealt with in original Decln of Intent – wh. can be restated.

P.M. And restraint on prices will help to prevent dividend increases.

S/S E.S. Can we reflate without recreating B/P problem,? Depends on exports. This might have justified a complete freeze: and new proposals may not suffice. Essential to deal publicly with dividends. Restraint of imports equally important.

P.M. Action already taken on capital a/c. has contributed a lot.

Ch. Exch. And, provided we maintain it, controlled reflation shd. be possible. – always provided that we keep costs under control and deal with defence expenditure. Can then start to rationalise £ balances; and can then envisage need for rather smaller B/P surplus in long term.

M.A.F.F. If this is not a purely psychological policy, what is to be sanction against price increases? e.g. on flour milling industry.

P.M. They are a concentrated cartel. If they are recalcitrant, power to control prices cd. be incorporated in legn.

F. S/S. Not necy in same Bill – for fear of raising same issue in relation to wages.

Ch. Exch. That wdn‟t be unreasonable?

F. S/S. I would not subscribe to these proposals if there were any question of statutory control of wages at any stage.

P.M. I agree: it wd. be unenforceable. Must rely on force of public opinion.

F. S/S. Easier for T.U.C. if this is announced by Govt. as a statement of their intentions before Congress gets to real debate.

Parly Sec. What about Whitley Councils, Review Body and other “independent”

M.H. bodies?

F. S/S. Can‟t promise they will remain as indept as hitherto. But hope we can work out some means of dealing with this – and related question of aribtrn.

S/S. S. Must present as logical devt of present policy – not as emergency measure. Important to be ready with planned reflation.

P.M. After announcement, I will make a broadcast on basis of confidence, i.e. as means of reinforcing success. Must emphasise productivity in order to identify workpeople with Govt.‟s policies on local basis – including scientists &amp; technologists.

Ch. Duchy. Mustn‟t link too closely with short term financial sitn. And must be ready to go ahead, even if T.U.C. don‟t support.

F. S/S. Maybe: but don‟t quarrel with T.U.C. unnecessarily.

M. Techy And wd. we support this if a Tory Govt. were in office? I wouldn‟t! Therefore can‟t argue that it is in interests of country.

P.M. But Tory Govt. wdn‟t construct the kind of package of wh. this is one element.

Therefore go ahead on basis of no statutory control of wages but planned expansion of wages within a planned expansion of the economy, without risk of renewed pressure on £. Must present on this basis – and F. S/S. must do same in dealing with T.U.C., as far as possible – i.e. not a further stage in deflationary Stage I but beginning of a new Stage, wh. will be expansionary.

F. S/S. and other Ministers shd. consider how &amp; when other bodies (including Board!) shd. be informed – in advance of formal announcement.

[Exit Parly Secy M./H.

2. Commercial Policy: Imports of Cotton Textiles. C(65) 122.

P.B.T. As in memm. Can‟t go back on what we have already told I. &amp; H.K. And textile policy now so difficult qua Lancashire that we can‟t allow it to become instrument of conciliation between I. &amp; P.

Don‟t preclude later revision if general desire – but not at instance of P. alone.

C.S. Make that change now – to anticipate pressure wh. will come, not only from P. On this basis cd. be justified to I. and H.K.: and wd. be valuable as political sweetener to P.

Col. Sec. Wd. be v. unfair to H.K., and a breach of faith.

Ch. Duchy In interests of Lancs., I support P.B.T.

M.O.D. So do I.

F. S/S. But if some concession to P. will be needed later, it will be at expense of Lancs? Therefore consider now – by multilateral talks?

P.B.T. But my proposals will give most help to Lancs. now. And P. has been given same opportunity as I. Must stick to this as opening bid in formal negotiations – although prelimry discussns have already established facts about attitudes.

C.S. But other countries, including P., wdn‟t agree that I. &amp; H.K. shd. have 100%. And them everybody will be dissatisfied.

P.B.T. But that must emerge from negotns: can‟t change front now without breach of faith with I. &amp; H.K.

P.M. Majority favour P.B.T. But he shd. discuss tactical handling with C.S.

3. Industrial Disputes: Motor Car Industry (oral).

M. Lab. At least 112 stoppages in this year so far, of wh. only 5 were official. Union has lost control. Causes of stoppages varied and often incredible.

? A general inquiry into the whole industry.. But v. long &amp; involved.

? Or a new M. Lab. fact finding team to investigate each stoppage at once.

But Unions wd. resist.

? Or legn. But obvious difficulties, particularly qua working to rule.

Hence proposal to convene Motor Industry Committee on Friday to meet P.M. &amp; myself: after which we must decide what to do.

P.M. Agree: will then consult Cab. again.
