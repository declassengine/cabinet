C.C. (65) 50 7 October 1965, 10 a.m.

1. Public Expenditure (oral).

P.M. Formalise Ch. Exch.‟s group – subject to refce. to Cab.

M.O.D. ? Add an „external‟ representative.

P.M. Will consider: but shd. not be a spender.

2. Coal Prices. C(65) 129.

M.P. As in memm.

F. S/S. Only £5m. at stake: the Exch. is already bearing the £20m. Why announce domestic increase 6 months ahead? Let W.P. explain cap. reorgn; method of dealing with deficit in 1965-66; possible need to increase prices next year: refce. to N.B.P.I.; and legn framed accordingly. But avoid any refce. to specific figures or timing. Otherwise I accept principle of increase and refce. to Board.

Ch. Exch. Refce. to Board shd. be now – on basis of “What shd. be price of coal?”.

We agreed to 3½% increase in Feby: but deferred action.

In March we agreed increase in August – but deferred announcement.

In July we reopened decision.

In August we more or less reaffirmed decision, for implementn in Sept.

We must now make up our minds and stick to it.

F. S/S. Coal Board largely responsible for changes of mind!

Ch. Exch. Total loss this year about £55m. We have taken £30m. on to Exch. (interest charges). Now suggested another £20m. to be so treated. Next year (ignoring £60m. int. charges) loss will be £40m. Are we to allow C. Board to run into red to tune of £65m? Transfer to Exch. is no escape – we must tax or borrow to finance it. Rates proposals ditto: also substitn of investt grants for investt allces. during period of overlap.

Can‟t stretch Budget indefinitely. Therefore if can‟t accept M.P.‟s proposal, at least put to N.B.P.I. and accept their ruling.

P.M. General refce. to Board – wh. wd. have to admit size of deficit?

F/ S/S. Agree. But difficult unless specific proposal: otherwise Board becomes arbitrn tribunal. But to refer prematurely will aggravate wage claims! Don‟t complicate things 6 months earlier than necy.

M.P. Not 6 months: refce. to Consultve Councils needed in Jany. And impact in April will be masked by seasonal price reductions.

M. Techy Refce. will disclose that C. Board were originally in favour of price increase but now wish to transfer bulk of charge to Exch. That is political decision – for Govt., not Board.

P.M. Refer to Consultve Council first? Then present deficit on Bill but say (without quantification) that to be referred to Council and thereafter to Board?

M.P. But Council bound to disagree – for fear of being overruled by Board.

F. S/S. Decision to legislate to make Board statutory precludes us from not intervening in price increases by natd industries. We must refer coal to Board.

P.M. Must be ready to admit delay – on grounds of not interfering with devt of p. &amp; i. policy. Admit this frankly in W.P: and say that, after refce. to Consultve C., will be sent to Board. Precise timetable must be worked out.

Ch. Exch. Then I must carry the £25m. on the Budget for the rest of this year. But, if so, we must accept Board‟s ruling for next year.

3. Oversea Affairs (oral).

a. Indonesia.

M/S. F.O. Sukarno has reappeared &amp; will try to reconcile Army &amp; P.K.I. Will Army co-operate or resist? They are at present in charge of sitn.

P.M. In any event, nothing will be the same again!

4. Rhodesia (oral). [Enter Att. Gen.

C.S. Discussions with Smith are at deadlock. ‟61 constn was not an indepce constn: hence provisions for 2/3rd majority &amp; referendum. Rh. resents latter and proposes Senate instead. Useless in view of composn. And no progress on rest of 5 principles, despite Rh. alleged willingness to negotiate on this basis. Hence refce. to P.M.

P.M. Agreed indepce seems to be finally ruled out, since we can‟t resile on any of our five principles. If so, we must be ready for a u.d.i. But their nerve may fail at last moment, in view of intl pressure which we are mobilising. We too must watch this pressure – U.N. reaction may be violent – military action etc. But no U.K. mily intervenn, for both technical &amp; political reasons; and we must try to prevent U.N. invasion stimulated by S.U. Not even U.K. participn in U.N. military action. (Watch risk of African reaction against Europeans elsewhere in Africa.) But must be ready to refer to U.N. at once – and no longer try to handle single-handed.

Watch threat of Rh. ec. war on Zambia (v. dangerous to U.K. industry) wh. might justify threat of collective action against Port if she won‟t co-operate.

Must let other white members of C‟w. decide action for themselves. But natural U.N. instinct will be to rely on non-involved countries.

But sitn cd. alter if altve Govt. asked for help to restore order and to prevent bloodshed. That wd. be different from any participn in a combat force – even tho‟ we can‟t decide now whether we wd. vote against, or abstain on, a U.N. resoln to create such a force.

Our own action will consist of financial sanctions in support of ec. measures, wh. shd. include a ban on tobacco imports. We must also dismiss Rh. Govt. and ourselves assume all Rh. powers and liabilities.

M.H.L.G. Including responsy for law &amp; order?

Ch. Exch. But what is altve?

L. Ch. There isn‟t one. A Govt. in exile (even if only one!) wd. be powerless and an embarrassment. And we can‟t recognise Smith. We can only hope that an altve Govt. will emerge, wh. we can deal with.

C.S. No question of immediately substituting a new Govt. for Smith.

P.M. Agree. Smith controls the local sitn completely for time being. But we must be ready at once to recall Parlt and to enact an Enabling Bill, giving us full constl authority.
