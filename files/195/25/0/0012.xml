C.C. (65) 18 25 March 1965 11.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral).

L.P. As in Statement.

P.M. If Lords reject War Damage Bill to-day, issue statement that we shall invoke Parlt Act on this occasion and respect will of H/C. (i.e. no payment of money). ? Also say that, if continues, shall seek mandate at next Election to make necy amdts.

L.P.S. Probably safe to-day. But reconsider before Cttee. stage, when different issue – of amdt. – arises.

2. Oversea Affairs (oral).

F.S. Saw Prest, and Ball. Also U. Thant. On V-Nam, U.S. striking at N. V-N, because of infiltration: and sole object is to stop this. Maxwell-Taylor‟s statement does not negative this: and I managed indirectly to make this clear in public.

Any altves? To clear out of V-N. wd. be unwise – U. Th. agrees: wd. merely shift Comm. pressure to Thailand, Burma etc. To refrain from retaln against attacks equally impracticable. Therefore only present policy remains. Its risks clear – may take long time to deter N. V-N; meanwhile S. V-N. may collapse. U.S. have weighed these risks; but consider present policy right. They do not intend to put ground forces into N. V-N: and they will inform (not agree) us about any extension of present policies. This wd. cover e.g. bombing of Hanoi (not yet in question).

Will this policy cause N. V-N. to stop infiltration? No sign of any response from Hanoi yet. Therefore we must try to explore Hanoi‟s mind – and we have plans to that end. If U.S. were satisfied (even without public statement) that infiltrn had stopped, they wd. stop their counter-attacks &amp; might even withdraw. But how verify infiltrn stopped? I told Rusk they shd. negotiate on this. They are shy of “negotiation”; but they wd. accept a unilateral initiative by us, as co chairman, asking Powers concerned what they wd. regard as a basis for negotns and wd. give us their own answer. They might also agree, in consultn, a form of words wh. cd. be addressed to other Powers.

On gas episode, I verified with U.S. strength of feeling in U.K. But only civil anti-riot gas (of type wh. we have extensively supplied) was used; and U.S. Govt. did not know!

On A.N.F., we are now in agt on reactivation of Paris Working Group.

Also in broad agt on M.E. &amp; Cyprus.

On U.N. also we agreed on policy re peacekeeping.

P.M. Sitn improved since Gromyko publicly rejected negotns until U.S. withdraw. We have now got some initiative going, under our control; and we have made clear to U.S. we are not merely their satellite.

Watch interests of India in any proposal for U.S. evacn of S.E. Asia. Any settlement must not only stop war but also establish regional security. But must watch U.S. susceptibilities on “negotiations”.

On gas, we can‟t condemn U.S. in our Govtl capacity. And napalm far worse than gas. But U.S. have undoubtedly damaged their image and given the enemy a propaganda advantage.

3. Prices &amp; Incomes C.(65) 47. [Enter Parly Sec. M/L.

F. S/S. As in memm. Devt will depend on personnel of Board and refces. wh. we make to it: prices shd. come before incomes: and purpose on incomes will be not only to restrain but to identify cases where more than norm. is justified.

Publish on 8th: include names, if possible.

Parly Sec. ? Try to “consult” other bodies (e.g. natd industries) before publicn: also

M/L. L.A.‟s.

M.P. I cd. give copies privately to my industries.

M.T. And I to mine.

F. S/S. I will consider – and hope to agree.

M. Tech. I remain sceptical. T.U. opinion varies widely about what it is they are agreeing to. Not one wd. subscribe to para. 14.

F. S/S. No ground for suggesting unions don‟t know what is involved.

No interference with existing arbitrn machinery: W.P. will simply be a guide to that machy. But if awards out of line, we can refer them to Board, if necy.

M.O.D. Para. 15(i)? [Exit M.H.L.G.

F. S/S. Must concede some benefit to individual worker – and some to community. But problem of low-paid craftsmen and highly-paid mass prodn worker will only be helped marginally: its soln will have to be found elsewhere.

S/S. Ed. No refce. in detailed criteria on para. 15 to cover “social justice”, e.g. teachers &amp; nurses.

F. S/S. Para. 15(iii) &amp; (iv) must suffice.

Ch. Duchy. What about retrospection which is normal in C. Service awards?

Ch. Exch. Is Board only advisory or semi-judicial? If the latter, cd. be v. difficult qua C.S. negotiating machinery.

F. S/S. That is why Board itself will have no initiative. We shall only rarely refer to them settlements achieved otherwise. Board is for those sectors wh. haven‟t got their own machinery. It will not be judicial but will hear cases in early formative stage and to create climate of opinion; and people will want to get certificate from Board before embarking on wage or price increase.

Ch. Exch. But must not hold down price rises wh. are inevitable in full employment.

[Exit P.B.T.

M. Techy. Must keep clear of statutory machinery – e.g. for agricl workers.

F. S/S. Agree: Board can only identify exceptional cases; and refce. remains with us.

P.M. Approve.
