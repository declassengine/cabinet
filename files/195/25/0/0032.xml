C.C.(65) 39 20 July 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Review of Public Expenditure: C(65) 97, 98 &amp; 101 (resumed).

M.O.D. Smallest increase in deptl allocns. Must maintain our aid image: and I am only executive arm of other Deptl policies.

We are v. careful about B/P. implicns: but watch importance of aid for our own trade and preventing world recession.

Mustn‟t fall behind previous Admn – even in 1961 they allowed £180m. as max: and £220m. was envisaged in ‟63-64 in subsequent White Paper, and £250m. in 1966. These commitments are now maturing - Indus Basin, new contribn to I.D.A. etc. Limitn to £216m. wd. mean cut-back – see Annex G table (p. 38) to C(65) 9), where many commitments wh. are clearly moral obligns, tho‟ annually renewed, are in Col. C. And remember Heath‟s U.N.C.T.A.D. pledge.

C.S. Can‟t ignore commitments already undertaken: otherwise further undermines confidence in £.

Ch. Exch. Inherited commitments were excessive from the outset. The 1% target not realistic in any foreseeable future, including ‟69-70 – particularly since balance on B/P. by end ‟66 no longer in prospect. Exports not rising fast enough: o‟sea expdre. not falling fast enough.

F.S. Must at least keep constant proporn.

P.M. If base is £205m., that means £252m. in ‟66-7.

F.S. Mustn‟t reduce – as now proposed – even if accept 1% deferred.

Foreign aid relatively small: but v. important &amp; must not suffer. Aid creates markets and is not a mere addn to B/P. deficit. And, if neglected now, can‟t be made good in future, particularly if commitments dishonoured.

P.M. In so far as aid releases “own” foreign exchange for imports, useful.

Ch. Exch. Provided that we get the exports.

F. S/S. Our commitments are to U.K. public as well as to o‟sea clients. Both must be contained within allocn for addl programmes, wh. is already overstretched. And growth required by Plan already threatened by recession – i.e. even less to play with.

And increase in aid (= lending) presentationally v. awkward when we are borrowing so heavily to protect B/P.

Col. Sec. Any redn in colonial commitments bad. Proposal provides v. little margin for new devts. Other countries won‟t help our colonies: and, if we fail on our commitments, we may pay price in political &amp; security terms.

L.P.S. I support M.O.D. Disparity between U.K. stand. of living and that of dev. countries must be rectified. B/P. effect can be offset by cutting o‟sea mily aid.

Ch. Exch. Agree: but means only smaller B/P. deficit, not a surplus.

L. Ch. Can‟t prejudge priorities on strength of one Deptl case.

Ch. Duchy I agree. Comparisons with previous Admn irrelevant: they cdn‟t have financed their promises.

S/S. W. If aid must be limited, ? spread it less evenly: concentrate on India.

M. Techy Some expansion provided in “basic” programme: and no additions possible unless some other programme cut.

P.M. Agree: programmes must add up and therefore an exercise in priorities. Housing still to come: and, later, pensions and assistance. Final decision must wait till then.

Basic programmes are Tory: and some are harder to cut than others, because contracts already let etc. (especially roads). Therefore Depts operating on annual basis must be flexible. Particularly important qua B/P. therefore must try to limit for. exch. content of aid – by increasing proportion of tied aid; by giving more aid in kind rather than cash; by persuading recipient countries to spend more of “own” for. exch. resources on imports from U.K.

Accept 1% target not in question. But Tsy. &amp; O.D.M. shd. now work out proposals wh. involve not more than £10m. next year and £15m. in

‟69-70 of extra for. exch. outlay: but concede on this basis £250-270m. as total on basis of offsetting from some other Deptl programme.

Ch. Exch. Unrealistic: involves corresponding increase in budgetary provision.

P.M. Very well. Consider whether £250-270m. programme for ‟69-70 can contain for. exch. element within increase of £15m. over now.

Ch. Exch. ‟69-70 limit shd. be £230m: otherwise some other programme suffers.

P.M. I agree – may be it will. But that is separate issue from limiting for. exch. increase.

Ch. Exch. But nobody knows what for. exch. element is now. That is what is disagreed.

F. S/S. And it assumes an increase in total programme, wh. can be financed only by cuts elsewhere. But where? [Exit M. Lab.

P.M. Maybe: but basic programmes are not sacrosanct.

P.B.T. There shd. be no increase in for. exch. outlay, for at least two years.

M. Techy And O.D.M.‟s basic programme increases year by year. It is this increase wh. needs to be called in question.

F. S/S. Can‟t re-open basic programmes now. Answer is “rolling” Plan – i.e. annual adjustments.

Ch. Exch. And basic programmes broadly approved by Cab. in Jany.

P.M. But not to extent of being sacrosanct.

Ch. Exch. They are for ‟66-67: too late to alter them now.

P.M. But not qua ‟69-70: they must be reviewable annually.

M.O.D. “Basic” programme was arbitrary.

F. S/S. But if we re-open one basic programme, others must be re-opened.

[Exeunt L. Ch. and L.P.S.

Ch. Exch. And I can‟t accept any programme wh. involved any addn to for. exch. element.

P.M. Turn to housing.

M.H.L.G. 250,000 better than 245,000. But no matter.

For ‟66-67: already a fall in private starts – recession may be near, altho‟ this year‟s completions won‟t be affected. If so, must be ready to let pub. sect. starts rise in autumn, as regulator.

If no increase in subsidies, watch announcement. Postponement of any announcement about mortgages wd. be politically feasible, if really severe action to be taken on e.g. educn and o‟sea aid. Must make a virtue of this necessity; and better to avoid a purely political mortgage scheme, for wh. no satisfy arrangement has yet been devised.

On this basis, I accept proposals.

S/S. E.S. Since largest %age increase is in subsidy provision, I welcome this. Even so, more houses mean more schools – for wh. I have no provision.

Ch. Duchy. On this basis, lower interest rates for L.A.‟s will come into effect before lower rates on mortgages. This doesn‟t matter: but we are half committed to B. Soc. Assn.

P.M. No: pledge was only on house acquisition, not on building by L.A.‟s for themselves.

F. S/S. If B. Socs. increase mortgage rates to 7% in autumn, we shall appear to acquiesce. And if L.A.‟s lend at less, we shall appear to be favouring them.

M.H.L.G. Even so, subsidy concession on mortgages this autumn indefensible to both domestic opinion (given other cuts) and intl opinion.

Only 30% of L.A. borrowing is from P.W.L.B; and only part of this is for mortgages.

P.M. A Natl Housing Finance Co-opn? Might tap addl savings.

M.H.L.G. Agree – much better than multiplicity of B. Socs. Use interval now obtained to elaborate this. Wd. take at least a year.

Ch. Duchy. Bear in mind attraction of B. Socs. – easy withdrawal etc.

[Exeunt F. S/S: M.H: M.P.N.I.

2. Aid Programme: Draft White Paper. C.(65) 105.

M.O.D. As in memm: an account of stewardship – in response to pressure and in discharge of repeated public programmes.

Heavily amended to meet Tsy. &amp; D.E.A. objections. General tone now no more expansionary than previous pronouncements: and can‟t not publish without appearing to funk the issue.

Ch. Exch. I feel – in agt with F. S/S. – that postponement is essential. Shd. coincide with Plan in Sept. Intl reception at this moment wd. be adverse; and we mustn‟t risk this.

H.S. I support M.O.D. – as offset to W.P. on Immigration in last week of Session. Must reinforce liberal public opinion.

Col. Sec. I agree. Can‟t go back on public promises to publish before Recess.

L.P. All White Papers are being deferred for total examn. Defer decision until complete programme before Cab.

M.H.L.G. Must watch detailed comparison with Immigration W.P. – on students etc. If published simultaneously, must not be discrepant in any respect.

P.M. Warnings on B/P. are v. clear; and may even be encouraging to “gnomes”. (But reconsider chapter on Private Investt.) And wd. get more publicy in Sept. than in July, when will be overshadowed by Immigrn. And lack of figures doesn‟t prejudice decision on amount of aid.

M.O.D. See para. 87 – complete absence of commitments.

Ch. Exch. But also para. 86 – large expdres. forecast.

S/S. W. Must offset Immigrn W.P. – provided careful collation.

Ch. Exch. I dissent – formally.

P.M. You can‟t: must send me a minute. Publish in last week with Immigrn W.P.

Ch. Duchy. Ch. Exch. shd. come clean about what he really fears.
