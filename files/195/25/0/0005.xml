C.C.(63) 11. 22 February 1965. 10 a.m.

1. Cabinet (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip: M/S D.E.A., Parly Sec. B/T.

P.M. Yesterday‟s article by A. Howard in S. Times quotes indivl civil servants: v. bad. Normal inter-Minl discussions shd. not be dramatised as personal clashes either Minl or official – least of all when premature on facts! Can‟t accept this challenge. All Ministers to instruct civil servants to give no more to A. Howard than to any other journalist.

Will also consider dangers to machine of Whitehall.

All Ministers shd. be accompanied when seeing Press.

Investigate to-day‟s leak on F.S.‟s peacekeeping Statement.

Ch. Exch. Watch implicns qua Budget leak. I shall have to consider how to handle proposals in order to ensure secrecy.

P.M. Yes: on any leak I shd. have to recommend a Tribunal.

I will consider how - &amp; when – Cab. shd. discuss strategy of Budget.

M.H.L.G. Yes: many of us feel left out!

P.M. Premature: have not yet reached that point. Press articles are speculation – ahead of events.

P.R.O.‟s shd. not try to build up individual Ministers‟ images: but they should be witnesses of any Minl contacts with Press.

M.H.L.G. And there shd. be a full record.

2. E.F.T.A. Ministerial Meeting (oral).

Ch. Exch. Trade figures better: but no economic case for reducing surcharge.

Political pressures in opposite direction v. strong: and redn necy to preserve E.F.T.A. On balance 5% across the board as from 26 April – i.e. 6 months from date of imposn. No promise of further cuts. From 26 April our B/P. may come under strain again: and will not inspire confidence in foreigners who lend to us.

Announce to E.F.T.A. midday to-day.

M. Techy Premature – not enough time to judge real effects. Pity Press specn has forced our hand.

P.M. Even so, risk of reprisals wd. have forced us to act.

Ch. Duchy Can‟t we assess impact more accurately?

Ch. Exch. Much of it absorbed by exporters &amp; importers in anticipn of redn.

M/S. D.E.A. This will continue in anticipn of abolition.

P.M. Approve. [Exit Parly Sec. B/T.

3. Vote on Account 1965-66. C.(65) 27. [Enter Ch. Secy. Tsy.

Ch. Exch. Revised in light of comments.

F. S/S. wants to omit last sentence of para. 7. But v. unlikely we can do better: and must retain some sense of definite control.

P.M. Note my public refutation of Govr of B/E: admit he is right to want to control all expre. – but decision is ours.

Discussed para. by para.

a) Para. 3: “corresponding increases in the 3 previous years”.

b) .. 4: “2.3% in real terms” – to be consistent with Def. W.P.?

c) .. ..: “checking [halting] the built-in escalation of defence expre.”

But escaln = rise in Service pay. Better “Checking the rise in…..”.

d) Para. 6: redraft by M.H.L.G. Accept – reinstating first sentence of original.

e) Para. 7: 4¼% p.a. ties individl programmes – e.g. housing – to figures wh. can only be increased by cuts elsewhere. An unrealistic straitjacket for as far ahead as 4/5 years, if private sector is left uncontrolled. And how can we decide on 4¼% before Plan ready? But some refce. to 4¼% may be necy to reassure intl financiers – and to indicate some concern for taxpayer.

Delete last sentence: insert “taking one year….” in previous sentence: also “This will mean correspondingly controlling the rise in private expre”. Only as nation succeeds in raising the annual rate of prodn increase above present ests. can these rates of public and private expre. be increased.

f) Para. 8: “This plan for public expre. will provide …..”.

[Exeunt M/S D.E.A: Ch. Secy Tsy.

4. Royal Commission on Medical Education C.(65) 25. [Enter M.H.

S/S. E.S. Need for enquiry not in dispute: and status of R.C. desirable in circs. of this obstinate profession.

P.M. In view of current rumpus on pay, will R.C. on this be needed?

M.H. No: they wd. resent it as means of deferring pay settlement. And last R.C. on pay was as recent as 1960.

Therefore go ahead with R.C. on educn.

Ch. Duchy But defer announcement until clear that pay row can be settled without some major new enquiry.

M.H. No: can‟t delay any longer.

P.M. Any refce. to o‟sea interests. Let S/S ES, MH &amp; M.O.D. discuss.

[Exit M.H.: Ch. Exch.

5. Racial Discrimination &amp; Incitement to Racial Hatred C.(65) 23.

[Enter M/S. C.R.O.: A.G.

H.S. As in memm. Introduce as second instalment of immigration control – and announce by P.M. in conjunction with mission to C‟w. countries etc.

P.M. Agree in principle. On memm?

M.H.L.G. Agree can‟t control landladies etc. But we cd. make unenforceable a bar on assignment on grounds of colour etc.

H.S. Will reconsider.

On Annex A, D.P.P. action proposed to help police to enforce. Precedent for D.P.P. to intervene in summary case: but justified here.

M. Lab. May be pressure to extend to empt.

H.S. Must resist this.

M.O.D. And union membership?

M. Lab. Unions won‟t budge on this. But R.Cm might consider. Meanwhile best to say nothing about empt.

H.S. On incitement, admittedly difficult to prove breach of peace likely to be caused. But worth effort for sake of bad case: and has advantage of covering religion.

L.P.S. Posn of N.I. in relation to this Bill?

H.S. Bill does not extend to N.I.: but N.I. Govt. may follow our lead.

P.M. May have to reconsider posn of N.I. in relation to Parlt at Westminster.

Will consider with L.P.

On Annex C., note new tough proposal in (5).

M. Techy 2(b) allows Smethwick Labour Club incident to be repeated.

H.S. Yes; but can‟t interfere with internal management of a club.

M. Techy 4 is rather odd!

H.S. But, if left to police, may involve them marginally in politics. Therefore use A.G. for wh. there is plenty of precedent. And police still have responsibilities under Annex B (i.e. under Public Order Act).

A.G. 5 is directed against big people – i.e. organisers of campaigns.

On 1, we shall be pressed to add “religion”. Must resist: opens too wide a field.

M/S. C.R.O. “Persons in temporary allegiance” old-fashioned. Reconsider.

P.M. Approve.
