C.C. (65) 57 4 November 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral). [Enter M/S. F.O: Chief Whip.

L.P. As in statement.

If prorogue on Fri can still recall on Monday if Rh. requires.

2. Parliamentary Private Secretaries (oral).

P.M. Yesterday‟s group meetings on Rh. Chairman (Ennals) gave statement to Press before seeing me. Statement harmless: may be useful. But procedure wrong: and cd. be embarrassing. If P.P.S.‟s want more freedom, they must resign. Therefore watch precedent. Will ask all Ministers to warn their P.P.S.‟s on lines of “Notes for Guidance”. P.P.S.‟s shd. consult own Ministers and Ch. Whip before any public activity.

3. Rhodesia (oral). [Enter A.G.

C.S. Smith seems to be still in control but under heavy right wing pressure; secret sources seem to be preparing for coup d‟etat.

P.M. Rh. Cab. probably split: S. still wants R.C. He cd. rally moderate opinion if threw over right wing. Must await outcome to-day‟s meetings of Rh. Cab. &amp; Caucus.

Can‟t accept any going back on unanimity – wh. S. clearly accepted. Nor can we accept any derogation from final reservation of Parlt.‟s rights.

M. Macdonald won‟t serve – for good reasons. But we may not get a R.C. at all. Even so political feeling in Rh. has been shaken by my visit: and ultimate blame will now rest clearly with S., since local opinion swinging against him.

Cab. to stand by in case of u.d.i.

Note clear signs of ec. weakening – import controls etc.

4. Immigration C.(65) 143. [Enter M.H.: Parly Sec. D.E.A.

H.S. As in memm. T. of R. doubtful: limited to quns of machinery, not policy.

Difficult to hold this. ?Widen to include right of appeal. This wd. partly meet criticism of omission of C‟w. Immigrn Bill from programme.

L.P. Point is to deal with evasions if C.I. Bill deferred. But must not revive discussn of vouchers etc: deal only with illiberal side of immigrn law – i.e. deportation qua C‟w. and alien immigrants. T. of R. shd. therefore be as narrow as possible – only deportn &amp; right of appeal – even narrower than in C.(65) 143, if possible.

Ch. Duchy. Agree: settle for proposal. C‟w. opinion may resent merely Deptl Cttee. ?Say Govt will appoint indept Cttee.

L. Ch. Wording won‟t do: not logical. Therefore reconsider.

A.G. T. of R. exclude those who come with no intention of settling. But these are subject of most criticism. T. of R. can‟t be as narrow as this.

M.H. Cttee. shdn‟t deal with legal aspects of health checks, wh. we have already decided.

M. Lab. Include a good T.V. spokesman.

M.H.L.G. But mainly lawyers if T. of R. narrow.

Col. Sec. C.O. wd. wish to consider names.

L.P. Shd. be set up by P.M: and mentioned in Deb. on Address.

P.M. Let Ministers (including A.G.) consider T. of R. this p.m: must settle before new Session. Names cd. wait – tho‟ better if they too can be announced. Report to me, in case another Cab. required. But T. of R. shd. be narrow.

[Exeunt M.H: Parly Sec. D.E.A.

5. Prices &amp; Incomes Policy C.(65) 141. [Exit M/S. F.O.

F. S/S. As in memm. Penalties difficult if T.U.‟s not to appear martyrs.

May be a political storm: must be sure Cab. agree.

M. Lab. I agree.

A.G. I too – see my letter: I can‟t do better than this.

L. Ch. I agree.

L.P. Proposal right: must face political criticism.

M. Techy Proposals logical consequence of p. &amp; i. policy. Won‟t be acceptable, particularly since exemption clause removed and no protection for shop stewards who fail to notify. Useless if 135,000 sh. stewards defy us.

F. S/S. T.U.C. won‟t accept exemption, even under voluntary scheme, since that wd. shake their authority. But law is not mandatory: we have discretion how to proceed – e.g. on trade dispute cd. be dealt with by M. Lab.‟s new procedure. Only wage claims must be dealt with as in C.(65) 141: and only a few of those. But for these we can‟t concede exemption.

M. Techy But that means big unions will be affected. You must get up to date T.U.C. view.

M.H.L.G. If Bill follows A.G.‟s letter, we shall create criminal offence (conspiracy) wh. we never intended to create.

F. S/S. Only altve is to put oblign of employer but to leave employees free to conspire to coerce him to break it. Impossible.

M.H.L.G. But see A.G.‟s (b) – exempts individuals (tho‟ not unions)?

F. S/S. We can include (b) as well as (a), thus limiting criminal liability and penalties and excluding civil liability. Max. penalty then £50.

M. Techy But can‟t stop at modest fine. T. unionists simply won‟t pay: and their unions will then pay for their defence.

P.M. But at least charge won‟t be criminal conspiracy – wh. wd. take us back to Tolpuddle!

M.P. No union gives sh. stewards power to withdraw labour. But national agts. are being replaced by factory agts: and it is sh. stewards‟ job to get better conditions – and to notify union if failure. Therefore unworkable.

F. S/S. But you must notify employer: we have then to decide whether to refer to Board: in interval negotn can continue: but, if no decision in 8 weeks, employer free to pay. Act will let us widen or narrow classes where we may require notification.

M. Techy I will not remain in a Cab. wh. provides no exemption.

F. S/S. Principle of Bill already approved by Cab: and must go on with it.

P.M. Yes: but let legal experts consider further.

S/S. S. And bring in Ld Advocate.

P.M. Yes: Law Officers to meet first with L. Ch. to consider.

F. S/S. Policy Ministers must be present, too.

P.M. Para. 12 of sketch of Bill shd. help, particularly if it cd. include some

de minimis provisions.

F. S/S. But a handful of men can wreck a national settlement.

M.H.L.G. And I‟m still uneasy about criminal conspiracy point.

Col. Sec. Para. 12 a dangerous weapon in hands of a Consve Govt.

P.M. They cdn‟t work the Bill at all. It requires goodwill!

M.O.D. If a unionist doesn‟t pay the fine?

A.G. Cd. be imprisoned for contempt. But safeguard if authy for presecn (even private prosecns) rests with A.G.

P.M. Bill shd. so provide.

M.P. Cd. (a) be limited to unions, excluding individuals (i.e. shop stewards)?

Or any person operating on behalf of a union?

F. S/S. But that simply removes authority from elective to unofficial individuals.

P.M. Remit back to E.D.C. with Law Officers &amp; L. Ch.

F. S/S. Remit what? Next step is to draft a Bill – wh. cd. then be examined further.

P.M. Yes – with help of legal experts: and then with consultn with T.U.C. on informal basis, with legal experts present. Must try to mitigate as far as possible implicns of a Bill wh. we have already approved in principle.

A.G. Mitign will still leave hard core of problem – i.e. legal consequences for employees if sanctions to be applied to employers.

M. Techy I will take no part in legn wh. provides no exemptions even if exemptions are provided administratively. They must be defined and included in Bill: and then they will be defied. Therefore better not to proceed with it.

F. S/S. Can‟t go back on Bill now.

Ch. Exch. Agree: must try to mitigate.

Ch. Duchy. Agree: T.U.‟s will cooperate, for sake of re-establishing control.

P.M. Agree: F. S/S. to carry on accordingly.

M.P. How will it work in relation to prices?

P.M. Investigate leak of coal prices! And misrepresn about Welsh Gas Board.

[Exit M.H.L.G: L.P.

6. Exchange Telegraph (oral). [Enter P.M.G.

P.M.G. As in lr to P.M. (copy circulated).

P.B.T. Only a technical monopoly: be careful.

F. S/S. And Extel hasn‟t provided much of a news service?

P.M. They share with P.A. to avoid 24 hr. service.

What about Universal News Services?

P.M.G. Read their tel. to Lloyd-Hughes.

Ch. Exch. It is only Extel‟s Parly service wh. is to be abandoned?

P.M.G. I think so.

P.M. P.B.T. to stall (doubtfully a monopoly – certainly not if U.N.S. come in &amp; use P.O. lines) and take charge. P.M.G. to refer to P.B.T.‟s reply &amp; defer P.O. view.
