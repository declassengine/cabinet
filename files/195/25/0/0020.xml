C.C.(65) 26 27 April 1965. 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip.

L.P. As in statement. [Enter M/S. C.R.O.

Also discussion of tactics on housing debate on 29 April.

2. Oversea Affairs (oral). [Enter M/S. D.E.A: M/S. B/T.

a) S.E. Asia.

F.S. See my statement yesterday on confce. on Cambodia. Useful as cover for talks on V-N: and essential since V-N. parties use C. Terry.

Original U.S. reaction to S.U. proposal was dept on S. V-N. reaction. We pressed them to endorse unconditionally – wh. they ultimately did. Meanwhile, Chinese had pressed C. to blow cold and to stipulate no talks on V-N. I. therefore accepted S.U. proposal quickly, in both substance and form. Difficult for S.U. to withdraw now, even under Chinese pressure. May therefore have chance of private talks on V-N.

b) E. Europe.

F.S. Visit to Yugoslavia &amp; Czechoslovakia. Relations improved bilaterally. Also discussed V-N. Czechs followed S.U. lead: Yugs. more flexible. Yug. on Cttee. of 24: and I therefore pressed them to recognise our good faith in decolonisation. They showed some response.

Czechs pressed us to say Munich Agt legally dead. But can‟t rewrite history by annulling a treaty – even tho‟ Germans may use it.

I cd. not concede this – but did my best to pacify them.

Czechs pressed for confce. on Eurn security. V. complex: but we may have to take some initiative. [Exit M.H.L.G.

c) S. Rhodesia.

P.M. Smith has arranged election - ? under extremist pressure. We must try to keep him off electoral propaganda for U.D.I. – and meanwhile maintain discreet discussions on our “principles” (wh. we are discussing with C‟wealth leaders). Industry &amp; commerce in S. Rh. apprehensive of U.D.I. Smith has refused to publish their views and threatens to publish tendentious W.P. of his own. If he did, we must respond appropriately. In fact, he published it last night: and we must now consider form of our reply urgently. Chances of avoiding U.D.I. now remote: consequences cd. be v. serious - ? another Congo, and damaging impact on Zambia etc. U.N. sanctions almost inevitable.

Must avoid any interference in Election: Smith not the worst of them.

d) W. Europe: confce. of Socialist leaders.

P.M. Last week-end‟s confce. at Chequers. On Europe, I dismissed idea of

joining C.M. at this point and reaffirmed our conditions, particularly qua agriculture. But admitted need for EEC/EFTA bridge on industrial groups: and outlined various possibilities in light of result of K. Round. Next EFTA Minl meeting might be at P.M. level, to discuss these? It wd. be without prejudice to our ties with C‟wealth. and wd. not be a move towards joining EEC. Cab. wd. need to discuss first. Useful to maintain initiative – even tho‟ not real progress until after German elections: and wd. remove bad taste of surcharge and reinforce EFTA cohesion.

Ch. Exch. Agree: must show we are not cutting ourselves from Europe. But, agriculture apart, watch monetary policy, wh. cd. be v. awkward in a “Free Trade Area”.

P.M. At Chequers I also made it clear that we wd. not surrender control over our own foreign &amp; defence policies.

Ch. Duchy. And must be ready to be flexible over our “conditions”.

P.M. Yes: Cab. must discuss F.S.‟s memm on Europe and new memm on possible initiatives. Otherwise risk that EFTA will break up: note Austria – and perhaps Denmark. [Exit M/S. B/T.

3. Military Aid to India &amp; Pakistan C.(65) 64. [Enter Ch. Secy Tsy.

M/S. C.R.O. As in Memm. In light of R. of K. dispute, leave timing of concession for subsequent considn with F.O. &amp; M/Defence.

Case for sub. political – importance of India to our posn E. of S. Otherwise I. will turn to S.U. – with results as in memm. Therefore make concession conditional on understanding no major military supplies from S.U. Difficult to obtain this, since we cannot supply interim frigates and can‟t supply any military aid as gift.

Can‟t press U.S.: original bargain was 50/50 and our share is now below 25%.

Important to reinforce pressure on I. not to mftre. nuclear weapons.

L. Ch. Must learn to say „No‟ at some stage. Subs. are of no military value: and they wd. begin an arms race between I. &amp; P.

Ch. Exch. I agree. No precedent for mily aid to I. &amp; Pak. until 1962. Hunters will complete £50m. programme then agreed. This wd. be start of a new programme for both countries. Other bids will follow.

Mily aid is now £30m. p.a. – major part for India.

Defer decision (R. of K. v. convenient!) until defence review completed.

S/S. D. Must keep Soviet navy out of Ind. Ocean. S.U. sub. means S.U. frigates: and that ends R.N.-I.N. relationship and brings Soviet naval presence wh. wd. increase cost of maintaining E. of S. role.

P.M. But I. wd. then cease to be non-aligned. Wd. not U.S. “discourage” this?

S/S. D. That wd. not reduce increased cost of maintaining our E. of S. role.

I. want a sub: and frigates – even if we cd. supply – wd. be irrelevant.

P.M. But better to build a frigate than to build a sub?

S/S. D. But we are building Leanders: we can‟t provide an interim Daring.

Col. Sec. This is S.U. blackmail – wh. will be repeated.

M.P. Some advantage in letting S.U. arm I. against China? Better to give I. ec. aid.

P.M. S.U. blackmail v. serious – extends to Africa. Must therefore plan military aid comprehensively (incl. counter-subversion supplies). Perhaps discuss military procurement with C‟w. P.M.s.

Establish Minl Cttee. for this purpose.

S/S. D. Agree. Must also seek understanding with S.U. on military supplies to third countries. On present case, buy time for this review.

F.S. Agree on cttee. On present case, risk of S. interventn is nearly certain. This will prejudice our defence review. Therefore buy time. Any approach to S.U. shd. include M.E. (wh. C. de Murville welcomed).

S/S. ES. I. faces starvation and is dept on U.S. aid. How can they risk this for sake of symbolic gesture?

Ch. Secy And if refusal of S. aid is to be condition of our mily aid, why cannot it be a condition of our ec. aid?

Ch. Exch. And this is only beginning of recasting whole of I. navy. And ec. aid is to be increased from £30m. to £40m. at same time! Ditto for Pak?

P.M. ? Revive earlier offer of T. class sub?

S/S. D. Wd. cost £1m. to refit!

P.M. Then reject proposal: Depts. concerned to consider how to handle.

[Exeunt Ch. Secy Tsy: M/S. C.R.O.

4. Iron and Steel Nationalisation C.(65) 63. [Enter M/S. B/T: A.G.

M.P. As in memm.

W.P. discussed para. by para: -

(i) Para. 13(d). Delete “It is widely agreed that…”; and strengthen specific refce. to manpower at end of para. 15.

P.M. On compensn, publish late Friday when S. Exch. is closed. Cab. to consider on Thursday a.m.

Debate on Thursday week. Involves political risk – qua Liberals and our own “rebels” – extending even to defeat. Therefore important to maintain a solid front and to sustain impression that this is a major Parly issue.

[Exit M/S. B/T.

5. Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921. C.(65) 62.

L. Ch. As in memm. Chairman cd. be a judge – but only if more judges!

H.S. I wd. accept delay as price of a judge in chair.

P.M. Agree: chairmanship for further discussn.
