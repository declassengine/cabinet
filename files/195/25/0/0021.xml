C.C. (65) 27 29 April 1965 12 noon.

1. Financial Sitn (oral).

F. S/S. Bank lending rising. May affect intl confidence. Therefore proposed to reintroduce Special Deposits at 1% = withdrawal of £80m. Announce today: operate in two instalments. Announcement by B/E: no Govt. statement unless pressure. I will explain to T.U.‟s no discrepancy with policy of controlled expansion. M.H.L.G. will deal similarly in housing debate to-day.

Ch. Exch. May drive some of smaller people, including ??? to market. No question of asking banks to give special considn to ???.

Illustrates our lack of control over sources of credit. We have an (unannounced) ceiling of £230m. for this year: and we must maintain it. Call will be ½% in Scotland.

Don‟t dramatise: play it all down.

2. Iron and Steel Nationalisation: Compensation terms (oral).

Ch. Exch. Exceptionally secret.

Possible bases:

a) denatd (i.e. 1953) values.

b) denatd values adjusted for profits ploughed back etc.

c) net worth – fixed &amp; current assets less current liabilities.

d) Capitalised earnings over a period.

e) S.E. values.

a) = £264m: v. cheap – but impracticable.

c) = £800m. +: that is other extreme.

b) = £620m.

d) = £680m. (on basis of 10 year period).

e) depends on period. 6 day 445 – i.e. 6 days before Queen‟s Speech.

6 month 470 - .. 6 months before Election.

3 year 597 - .. 3 years .. ..

5 .. 533 - .. 5 years .. ..

e) is most defensible. Period shd. include periods of slump &amp; boom and periods when there was, and was not, expectn of renatn.

This points to 5 years before Election i.e. 1959-64 = £533m.

On unquoted shares – e.g. Vickers, T.I. &amp; G.K.N. – must resort to arbitrn – wh. adds £70m. (to all calcns).

Also allow a 6 month altve (to cater for circs. of St. &amp; Lloyds) – tho‟ most companies will take 5 year period.

M. Techy Too high. 6 days before Q. Speech better – when renatn being actively discussed.

Ch. Exch. Wd. be cheaper: but arguable that it wd. reflect political fears, not real value of shares and assets.

S/S. W. Relation to W.P. on Natd Inds?

Ch. Exch. Must expect industry to reach target. But will be less profitable in future – and therefore wrong to take capd earnings as base of compensn.

Ch. Duchy. How widely are shares held – e.g. by miners‟ co-ops. etc? Watch political implicns. And what form will compensn take? If stock, will there be unloading?

Ch. Exch. No knowledge of distribn. Compensn will be fixed interest Govt. stock, not subject to c.g. tax on transfer (altho‟ on realn). May be some unloading.

M.P. A new industry since 1951. Values at that date, plus capital subsequently invested, gives higher figure!

F. S/S. On balance, proposals are right. Guard secrecy until 3.30 p.m. to-morrow.
