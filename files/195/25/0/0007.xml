C.C.(65) 13 2 March 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Doctors‟ Pay C.(65) 37 [Enter Ch. Whip: M.H.

M.H. Award – with strings. B.M.A. wanted strings removed – or asked whether, if schemes rejected, award wd. stand. Hence Review Body‟s letter. ?Concede, since no extra cost and fundamental review in prospect, wh. will have to take this into account (without commitment).

Ch. Exch. Review will also take account of remumn – ahead of next review of pay, wh. is not due until next year.

M.H. Can protract this: and can try to make any increase in quantum dependent on postponement until due date.

S/S. S. I agree: no altve. But v. discreditable. Younger elements in profession will co-operate in fundamental review.

Ch. Duchy A matter of esteem – i.e. of financing of N.H.S. Too dependent on Exchequer: shd. be more related to contriby insurance schemes, particularly since something will have to be done about existing part of cost which is borne by N.I.S. stamp when N.I.S. system reshaped.

P.M. M.H. has handled sitn well – in refusing to negotiate under duress.

M.H. 40% of G.P.‟s have “resigned”. Meeting on 24 March to decide whether to submit these with 3 months‟ notice as from 1 April.

I will see profession to-day: give them our decision: and warn them that, if notices sent in, negotns must be broken off.

P.M. Agree. [Exit M.H.

2. Land Commission C.(65) 34.

[Enter M.L.N.R: M.P.B.W: Sol. Gen.

L.P. As in memm. In circs., size of levy is key factor. This depends on c.g.t, which comes after levy. Hence divn of view on initial powers and functions of Cmn. Note dangers of “holding off” during interim period – wh. cd. wreck the scheme.

M.L.N.R. An enabling Bill: therefore set out full powers at outset, and make Cmn subject to Minl direction. This will make clear essential purpose – to reduce price of land.

Essential to minimise challenges to compulsory purchase. And if limited powers, can enforce only limited levy (e.g. 10% at max).

M.H.L.G. Must be administratively practicable – from the outset. Manifesto assumed a monopoly Cmn: but, if only a permissive Cmn, must start modestly. Compulsory purchase on M.L.N.R.‟s lines leads to para. 9(4) last sentence, wh. is intolerable at outset, when tough attitude will frighten people off, whereas mild approach (to be strengthened later) would not.

P.M. Para. 27(i): a major political decision. If trouble with Lords, better on a big issue than a small one.

M.L.N.R. Full powers must be taken at outset for technical reasons. Couple this with permissive approach by Minl direction, without second Appointed Day. Otherwise, you rule out provision of land for housing at cheaper prices (as M.H.L.G. does); and levy is derisory.

M.H.L.G. But effect of large threat in period when Cmn can‟t operate widely will be damaging politically and deter land from coming forward.

P.B.T. I support M.H.L.G.

M.P. What about c.g.t.? Can‟t decide levy without knowing this.

Ch. Exch. C.g.t., assessed on April ‟65, will bite little in early years – and will therefore encourage land to come forward.

Essential to train more valuers – even by pay increase? But ‟67 is earliest date: and, if Parlt Act has to be invoked, it will be ‟68.

M.H.L.G. Even so, “speculation” will be inevitable during interim.

Ch. Exch. Can we put “levy for L.A.‟s” into general assistance to L.A.‟s? Must be clear before we put it in Bill.

M.H.L.G. Must consider further, since L.A.‟s will be divided.

S/S. S. Levy will increase price of land.

M. Techy If not opve till ‟67-‟68, shd. we proceed at all?

L.P. We did not consider this at all.

P.B.T. a) I support M.H.L.G. on tactics. b) Levy will increase price of land (even tho‟ may be offset by extra aid to L.A.‟s). c) Land for industry won‟t be helped by Cmn, since B/T. have powers of compulsory purchase – and tho‟ we have to pay full market price, not clear how we shall benefit from repayt of levy. As already agreed, therefore industrial land shd. be excluded.

P.M. Even as regards devt areas? At least leave this possy open in Bill.

P.B.T. I accept.

Ch. Duchy. I support (i)(b) plus (ii) – i.e. including Aff. Resn procedure. Anything more severe objectionable politically and constitutionally.

M.L.N.R. Cmn vulnerable if a second Affirm Resn. Cd. make Minl direction subject to Affve Resn.

P.M. Wd. second Appted Day require approval of both Houses? If so, and if it were in putative last Session of Parlt, Lords cd. wreck it; and we cd. not alter sitn – either as regard Parlt Act or right of Lords to deal with stat. instrmts – until after an Election.

M.H.L.G. Immaterial in terms of electoral considns in relation to Lords. But, admvely, my proposal is better.

P.M. But how answer criticism that second Appted Day is a gift to Lords‟ obstruction?

L.P.S. Lords more likely to muck the Bill about by amdt.

P.M. Agreed full powers in Bill. Only method of implementation in dispute, with complicn of Lords. ?Undertake not to implement wider powers until after debate in Commons (but without formal Affirmve Resn).

M.H.L.G. I accept.

M.L.N.R. So do I.

M.H.L.G. But powers in initial phase will be as in para. 9(ii).

M.O.D. But is this wide enough to overcome resistance of owners to provide land for devt?

M.L.N.R. It is 9(i)(3) &amp; (4) wh. are at stake here.

P.M. P.B.T. doesn‟t want (3) – so that can wait for phase 2.

Only (4) remains.

M.H.L.G. (4) can be accepted. But extent of compulsory purchase powers remains in dispute.

M.L.N.R. Yes. We have now agreed, purposes &amp; priorities. It is not until Cmn is acquiring all land for devt that it needs compulsory purchase. And it is at that point that phase 2, with special H/C. procedure, begins.

F.S. But attitude on comp. purchase shd. be as at end of 9(i).

M.H.L.G. No: that wd. be to give weak Cmn enormous powers – e.g. automatic revocn of planning permission without compensn. This is a tremendous threat – wh. cd. only be invoked at Stage 2.

Ch. Exch. I agree: it wd. be inoperable – at outset.

M.L.N.R. Stage 1 means 9(i) (1) (2) [(3)] (4) – excl. pr. housing – and last four lines of para.

P.M. Agreed: now para. 27(iii).

Ch. Exch. This will excite L.A.‟s to expect cut of levy. How decide between this and other competing claims? Better to reserve to Cmn as a capital fund for some years. Otherwise, Exch. will be expected to subsidise Cmn to help L.A.‟s.

M.H.L.G. But politically essential – and the minimum for this purpose.

P.M. And safeguard in para. 19(iii).

P.B.T. But don‟t keep L.A.‟s waiting too long for reimbursement.

M.H.L.G. For discussn with L.A.‟s – particularly since subsidy review inevitable.

P.M. Para. 27(iv).

Sol. Gen. 3 altves. – long leases: new form of freehold: Crownhold.

Legally, (a) best. Inconsistency with leasehold enfrnt defensible if reversionary interest belongs to Crown, not a private owner. Useful to be able to lease Crown land on conditions of devt in public interest (as in Kenya).

New form of freehold involves new form of register of title, and other legal problems.

Crownhold is a form of occupancy – i.e. Cmn wd. have to deal directly with occupiers, with all complicns of para. 22.

M.L.N.R. Bill need not be precise: but I agree with Sol. Gen. Any new form of tenure wd. make Bill impossible this Session. And not inconsistent with l‟hold enfrnt.

M.P.B.W. We depend on voluntary treaty: therefore we shd. have to take compulsory purchase powers in this Bill.

P.M. For separate discussn between Ministers concerned.

M.H.L.G. There will be some inconsistency with l‟hold enfrnt, since lease will belong to somebody else and will deteriorate in value.

Ch. Exch. Not serious if leases are for 999 years.

S/S. S. Not applicable in Scotland, where no leasehold system.

P.M. Consider separately. Also any need for Queen‟s permission to use term “Crownhold”.

Para. 27(v).

Cd. date of Apped Day be put in Bill?

M.L.N.R. I must, in order to define interim period. But I will take power to postpone – without refce. to Parlt – if necy.

P.M. Accept para. 26, on this basis.
