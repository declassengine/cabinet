C.C.(65) 42 27 July 1965 6.30 p.m. H/C.

Commonwealth Immigration. C(65) 109 and 111.

L.P. Must be specific refce. to Malta. Amdt. agreed – commitment to be recognised.

Col. Sec. A pity.

L.P. Substitute “obligation” for “commitment”.

S/S. D. Amend to “8500, including priority provision for Malta for time being” – i.e. 5000 in discharge of special oblign.

P.M. Agree. Also 15% limit on Cat. A. vouchers.

L.P. Para. 17(ii): applicns will “generally” be dealt with in order of date of receipt, to meet M. Lab.‟s point about priority for nurses etc.

M.O.D. Can‟t agree Cat. A. shd. be pre-empted to meet our needs.

P.M. Amend to “applicants, whether skilled or unskilled”. Add “generally” but so administer that some, if asked for by employers, will be unskilled.

L.P. Aliens: ? best to avoid any refce.

M.O.D. Must at least say number will not be allowed to exceed present rate (wh. is declining).

P.M. Say “Govt.‟s policy will be to ensure that number of aliens for permanent settlement will not be allowed……”.

M.O.D. But now stringent control over C‟w. immigrants: must keep aliens in proportion.

F. S/S. If so, we deny ourselves labour for essential services: and an alien quickly becomes indigenous.

P.M. As in formula read out.

L.P. Dependants: ClC recommended 1 Sept., even tho‟ admve prepns won‟t be complete. Otherwise, tremendous influx of deps.

C.S. Impracticable.

P.M. Agree.

H.S. Repatriation and conditions of entry?

A.G. H.S. shdn‟t be able to evict on unspecified grounds, without any conviction?

H.S. Yes.

P.M. But surely only if entry was illegal – not for unconvicted, though known, offences. Least of all for political offences!

H.S. But I have power to evict undesirable aliens.

P.M. No reason for extending, apart from illegal entry or failure to accept conditions.

H.S. Then purpose of measure will be flouted.

P.M. Can‟t help that. Result of proposal wd. be to reopen issue in relation to aliens, wh. has been strongly criticised. Amend paras. 26-28.

Affirmve Resn – out.

L.P. Financial Assistance to L.A.‟s: Tsy. want redraft.

Ch. Secy Better to make no refce. until scheme worked out. But, if must concede, Tsy. draft safer.

M.H.L.G. Can‟t accept “limited period”: only permissive anyhow.

P.M. Agree omission.

A.G. Omit two refces. to “only honest to recognise”.

C.S. Omit figures on p.5, at serial 4. – otherwise appears that old C‟w. are main evaders. Unfair over so short a period.

P.M. Yes: leave both out.

Parly Sec. Omit para. 10 – too racialist.

D.E.A.

P.M. Agree.

A.G. Para. 53: omit “he is intransigent”. Agreed.

M.H.L.G. Amdt. to para. 27: “ we hope L.A.‟s will provide accn”. Agreed.

Parly Sec. Strengthen para. 35: amdt. proposed.

D.E.A.

P.M. No. Statement approved: add “for this purpose” at end of para. 7.

L.P. to make statement. Tribute to his work.
