C.C. (65) 23 6 April 1965 11 a.m.

1. Immunities &amp; Privileges for Commonwealth Secretariat.

C.(65) 55.

C.S. As in memm. Some concession required to secure location in London. Hence my compromise proposal.

H.S. I wd. not oppose provided no qun of personal immunity.

A.G. I agree.

Ch. Secy Illogical to concede duty free liquor but to refuse personal immunity in respect of resultant traffic accident! No functional justificn: and no means of restricting to represl use. Parliament will oppose – the more so since a transparent device to provide duty free liquor. And no precedent for this compromise: therefore dangerous.

M/S. F.O. We don‟t oppose – tho‟ dislike. Precedent is U.N.

Ch. Duchy. Purely a qun of status.

L. Ch. Avoid this concession &amp; pay more?

S/S. W. 6000 people already enjoy dip. privileges. Another Order will be last straw.

C.S. If we make no concession, we shall seem to be killing Sect.

F. S/S. Can we be evaded by secondment from High Commissions?

M. Techy But that wd. be intolerable and wd. spread to other intl orgns in London.

L. Ch. Compromise worse than full diplomatic status.

F. S/S. I agree. Let H.A.C. re-examine on this basis. But if personal immunity not to be conceded - ? Cab. must then reconsider.

2. Parliamentary Commissioner. C.(65) 50.

Ch. Duchy. As in memm. A Parly instn, rather than a public instn. Hence para. 4. But Peers &amp; composn of S. Cttee. left open: I wd. favour Peers.

Other main issue – access to Cab. records etc: see para. 27.

On scope (para. 5), not as wide as e.g. N.Z. – “oppressive” etc. Therefore define functions broadly (as for C. &amp; A.G.) and leave to P.C.‟s discretion. But exclude areas in para. 9.

L. Ch. I support – including Peers.

M. Techy But companies? Cd. P.C. take charge that we are damaging company by pressing for Br., rather than U.S. computers? And compel me to give evidence on oath? And, if I did not comply, pillory me in Parlt? Who is going to run public business – P.C. or Ministers properly answerable to Parlt?

Ch. Duchy. But see para. 5 – no jurisdicn on policy: and para. 9(f). And all decisions by Minl discretion outwith the P.C.

M. Techy But a corpn lawfully resident here can complain about an administrative error or fault on my part in e.g. pressing Br. computers.

Ch. Duchy. No: that is a matter of policy and Minl discretion.

M.P. But take Bolney-Lovedean transmission line. If I decide on a course and reject M.P.s‟ pleas and M.P.s then go to P.C., can latter then intervene – at point where much work done &amp; much money spent or committed?

Ch. Duchy. See para. 11. And it is faulty administration, not faulty judgment, wh. P.C. can investigate.

M.H.L.G. My planning permission decisions may be very vulnerable. But I would still go ahead with proposal – wh. shd. now be fairly foolproof.

M.O.D. I agree in principle. But I disagree with para. 4 – it will kill whole impact of project – i.e. attempt to give additional right to private citizen. Anybody who fails to get satisfaction via M.P. shd. not be debarred from second shot through P.C. This is totalitarian and means either giving M.P. a veto on access to P.C. or promoting Dutch auction between M.P.s (and Lords!) to find one who will approach P.C. And M.P. will lose his protection against having other M.P.s “interfering” in his constituency. Burden of extra work intolerable; and M.P.‟s will become mere post office. Therefore I favour course in para. 18(ii) second part.

L.P.S. On Peers, we must include them. They have more time than M.P.s: and Labour Peers need something to do.

M.O.D. But shd. Peer have right to take up case without first shot via M.P.?

F. S/S. But they do at present!

M.H.L.G. And exclusion wd. reduce status of Peers!

A.G. But this wd. reactivate Peers! And a S. Cttee. wd. have to be joint.

Balance &amp; selection wd. be difficult.

S/S. S. I oppose Peers: no part of original concept.

M.T. I too: how justify including Peers while denying public direct access?

F. S/S. But it might also give Peer right to complain implicitly about conduct of M.P. And joint committee wd. give addl status to Lords, wh. we don‟t want.

S/S. D. Reason for denying public direct access was to interpose some filter between public &amp; P.C: and this filter ought to be elected repves. No case for including Peers.

L. Ch. But some people have no M.P: and person complained of (Minister) may be complainant‟s own M.P.

M. Techy I support M.O.D. But Lords, as members of public, can chase Ministers thro‟ their own M.P.‟s. Therefore no case for giving them more.

L.P. I always favoured direct access for gen. public: but for practical reasons must be some filter. If enlarge that filter beyond 630 M.P.s, may as well revert to direct access.

S/S. W. Direct access wd. overwhelm P.C., undermine authy of M.P., and put M.P.‟s at mercy of pressure groups organised on P.C. This applies to Parlt as a whole, therefore include Lords.

H.S. Purpose of P.C. is to help M.P.s. If so, Lords are out. But Lords can include Deptl Ministers. On balance, confine to M.P.s.

M.A.F.F. I agree. But whole concept a mistake.

C.S. I personally agree. But, if we do it, we can‟t diminish powers of Lords. Therefore they shd. be in.

M.H.L.G. If M.P. can approach P.C. on behalf of anybody (not merely his own constitnts), we are clearly backing a Parly concept: and, so long as Parlt includes Second House, Lords shd. be included.

Ch. Secy I endorse whole proposal as democratic advance. Therefore undemocratic instn like Lords shd. be excluded.

S/S. ES. I agree with M.A.F.F. – exclusion of N.H.S., L.A.‟s etc is evidence. But I wd. exclude Peers.

F. S/S. Exclude Peers – and joint S. Cttee.

M.O.D. But also confine access to cases where access via M.P. has failed?

F. S/S. No: that wd. be more rigid than at present.

Pass to Cab. papers etc. – see para. 27.

Ch. Duchy. I recommend para. 27 (4).

L.P. Cd. not defend a decision to refuse access in a particular case. Must be all or nothing.

F. S/S. Then complete ban wd. be wiser.

M.T. But there may be cases – e.g. compulsory acquisitions?

F. S/S. But must draw line somewhere: can‟t have P.C. asking Ministers how they “voted”.

S/S. D. But some cases of maladmn are interdeptl.

F. S/S. But there is always one Minister in primary charge.

Right decision is no access at all. And Cab. Office to be excluded.

M.O.D. What about natd inds? Include them.

Ch. Duchy. P.C. is concerned with public admn. Therefore L.A.‟s shd. come before natd inds! But both wd. be impractical.

P.B.T. And natd inds are in competn with private industries and outwith P.C.‟s jurisdiction.

L. Ch. And don‟t overload the P.C. at outset.

M.O.D. Para 9(g) - ? includes industrials – i.e. excludes them!

Ch. Duchy. Yes.

F. S/S. Sanctions – para. 12? Agreed.

Embassies etc.?

M/S. F.O. Action at posts abroad often affected by local Govt: and practical difficulties. Therefore exclude.

F. S/S. Agreed.

White Paper (to be circulated to Cab.) later in Session: legn next Session.

3. ELDO. (oral). [Enter M. Avn: M/S. Disarmt.

F. S/S. No time for discussn in Paris. Therefore proceed as at last Cab.‟s decision.

S/S. ES. But watch new impetus to A-Fr. techl co-opn! This is a wholly unproductive enterprise.

M. Avn Anyhow Fr. Govt. are now prepared to accept W.P.‟s report. If so, we can‟t refuse to endorse it. That means accepting in principle a stage beyond ELDO A – tho‟ leaves open form, finl liability etc.

F. S/S. More limited at outset?

M. Avn No: Fr. (with other Govts.) will only withdraw oppn to W.P. report if commitment in principle to ELDO B is accepted.

M. Techy In view of new A-Fr. techl co-opn, don‟t be too costive.

S/S. D. I don‟t dissent. But Bondi Cttee. established little Fr. enthusiasm for ELDO but much for co-opn with us. ELDO is only an instrument for this.

M/S. Dis. I agree. Mainly a political exercise.

M.A.F.F. No: an economic &amp; techl project, to be justified on these grounds.

M.P. Then explore scope for co-opn without ELDO.

Ch. Secy No economic case at all. All ec. args. against it.

Political argt strong – but co-opn shd. be on positive things, not on a project wh. can only create embarrassment &amp; wasteful expre., wh. shd. to diverted to genuinely scientifically beneficial ventures.

Why waste £15-20m. of the saving of £30m. (this year) on TSR 2 wh. we have only achieved with so much effort?

And why shd. M. Avn pre-empt margin for “addl projects”. Therefore stop whole project forthwith.

F. S/S. But this goes back on Ch. Exch. at last discussn.

Ch. Secy No – because P.M. has opened up altve possibilities of A-Fr. techl co-opn: and M. Avn is now proposing to go further – to ELDO B.

M/S. Disarmt But P.M.‟s initiative strengthens case for going ahead with ELDO.

M. Avn Can‟t pull out – wh. wd. concede to U.S. monopoly. Both F.O. and

M. Techy support from their points of view. And can‟t rebuff Fr., given new impetus to techl co-opn. And, given cuts wh. M. Avn have recently accepted, no qun of my pre-empting resources.

F. S/S. ? Reaffirm last Cab. decision.

M. Avn No: bec. W.P. envisage continuing to ELDO B. We can‟t reject this.

F. S/S. ? Accept participn in ELDO B. in principle subject to satisfn on cost-sharing etc. Also say privately to Fr. that other forms of co-opn wd. be better.
