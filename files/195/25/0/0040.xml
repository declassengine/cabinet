C.C.(65) 48 16 September 1965 3 p.m.

[Enter Ch. Whip: M.H: Parly Sec. D.E.A.

1. Local Govt. Finance. C.(65) 125, 126 &amp; 127.

Ch. Exch. Redeems election pledges. No source of L.A. revenue other than rates: none of them is buoyant enough. Even rates now smaller %age of both personal income and all forms of taxn. But popular sentiment calls for some easement – not abolition, since rates will still increase but no faster than G.D.P. &amp; incomes. Device of moving Exch. guarantee, wh. wd. have to be fixed in advance and wd. limit Exch. commitment while leaving L.A.‟s free to supplement if they wish. Strengthens Exch. control over L.A. expre.

Min. number of specific grants – educn (because so large and so variable as between L.A.‟s.) In addn, Rates Support Grant - ? plus specific grants for health &amp; H.D. services. But these wd. be deductions from R.S.G: and so much less wd. remain for other services.

Also capital grants: greater control over L.A. borrowing and greater secy for L.A.‟s.

Central Govt/L.A. relationship may need to be further revised in 10 years or so: this new scheme will carry us over till then.

M.H.L.G. R.S.G. replaces rate deficiency grant. This benefits poorest L.A.‟s: therefore R.S.G. must be kept as large as possible and specific grants as few as possible.

S/S. E.S. Endorse proposal. Specific grant for educn justified for Ch. Exch.‟s reasons – as formula, not %age, grant. 50% lower than the old 60% %age grant: but accept for reasons in memm.

S/S. S. Agree: emphasise that 50% grant is not only element of contribn to educn expre.

It is distribn formula of RSG. wh. will matter: it must be as “fair” as present equalisn and deficiency grants.

H.S. See para 27. Special grants wd. admittedly deduct £250m. from R.S.G. But there is a corresponding dedn from L.A. expre?

M.H.L.G. But specific grants go equally to rich &amp; poor: we shd. concentrate on helping poor.

H.S. Even so, my point is valid. On my services, I accept fire services in R.S.G. for time being, subject to later consideration if an inquiry into Fire Services shows need to strengthen my powers of control. Child care services shd. be specific grant – at least while new service is being mounted.

Police strongest case for specific grant. Growing anxiety about crime: and I must have more control to enforce amalgamations, efficiency etc. This is existing system and must be retained.

M.H. Local health services have acquired parity of esteem with educn. This will be lowering of their prestige. Need for health services varies as widely as need for educn – i.e. with distribn of very young &amp; very old. R.S.G. can be kept high if specific needs grants are 45% - or 40% if police included in specific grants. Redn from 60% to 40% no worse than 50%, since total support will not be reduced. Only altve is more expensive hospital service.

M.T. I have surrendered all my specific grants. I can justify since L.A.‟s will get more in total and be freer to spend it as they wish. But exceptions for health, police etc. will so diminish R.S.G. that it won‟t carry my expre and specific roads grants will have to be reintroduced.

S/S. W. Substantial R.S.G. essential if L.A.‟s are to co-operate.

L.P.S. Scheme is based on need: control and sanction have receded.

Ch. Duchy But R.S.G. will be frustrated in its purpose by more specific grants, wh. will reduce it by more than 1/3rd (£250m.) and will reduce incentive to L.A.‟s to manage their affairs economically and to respond sensitively to local needs.

L. Ch. I agree – except on police, where (in absence of national force) financial sanction is essential for control.

No need for C.D. grant – L.A.‟s shd. be left to spend as little on it as possible.

M.O.D. I support L. Ch.

Parly Sec. No – not on police. R.Cmn advised against national force.

D.E.A.

S/S. S. And ‟64 Act gives H.S. considerable powers. Only health deserves separate considn – to prevent L.A.‟s from cheeseparing.

M.H.L.G. But H.S. has hitherto had a specific grant – whereas health &amp; welfare haven‟t. Therefore ? let police grant continue. But can‟t go below 50%.

Ch. Exch. I support H.S. Otherwise a national force will become unavoidable.

P.M. Assume reform of rating system also going forward.

On grants, accept proposals on capital grants: basic re-orgn of revenue grants, even at expense of taxn increase; specific grants only for educn and police – but ? not civil defence, subject to C.D. review.

Legn to be drafted on this basis – and to include rating reform, if poss.

2. Kashmir (oral).

C.S. Fighting stabilised while forces re-grouped. Some signs of contact between China &amp; Pak.

F.S. U. Thant reports I. rejected ceasefire because they want to retain posns in Kashmir: P. because they want guarantee K. will be dealt with politically. He will propose to Secy C. cttee. of U.S., U.K., France &amp; S.U. to watch sitn: meeting of Ayub &amp; Shastri on neutral ground, with repves of cttee. – as they were willing to in 1962.

Alternatively, an A/Asian cttee: but all 3 Moslems!

Cttee. of 4 depends on S.U. who will be influenced by estimate of Indian needs. U. Th. says P. confident about military outcome: I. less so.

He rejected inclusion in S.C. resn of embargo on arms, since China &amp; Indonesia aren‟t U.N. members. Therefore simple call for ceasefire and Cttee. of 4 to offer good offices.

How shd. we react? ?Wait for S.U. reaction. ?Or endorse forthwith.

C.S. If S.U. won‟t play, C‟w. initiative might be possible. Watch wording of resn v. carefully.

F.S. U. Th. saw no scope for C‟w. at present.

S.U. friendly but uncommunicative.

P.M. Must let Secy C. operate for time being: C‟w. must wait.
