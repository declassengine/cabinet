C.C. (65) 19 30 March 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Foreign Affairs (oral).

a) S.E. Asia (oral).

F.S. U.S.‟s only objective to stop N. V-N. infiltrn. Even M-Taylor may not have intended to imply more. If that objective involves doing more of what they are doing now, they will inform us in advance.

N. V-N., Russia &amp; China remain opposed to conference: they insist on complete U.S. withdrawal. Few people wd. recommend this, even among critics of U.S. policy. But must continue to explore possibilities – hence G-Walker mission – by U.S. statement and our covering note to Powers. Also press our proposal to S.U. that as co chairmen of Laos confce., we shd. consider what shd. be done with I.C.C: i.e. a prelude to contacts on V-N. also.

But no evidence we shd. get better Sino-Soviet response by dissociating ourselves from U.S.

M.O.D. But policy in longer term? Can U.S. succeed within present military limits? Suppose U.S. have to go further – bombing Hanoi or scorched earth policy? Shd. we be bound, by present acquiescence, to condone further escalation?

P.M. Cab. wd. have to consider at the time. U.S. have promised to give us time to consider and make represns: and we are not committed to escalation. U.S. at present not pursuing a scorched earth policy.

M.O.D. But are U.S. preparing way for eventual reunification? No prospect of lasting peace on basis of divided V-N.

F.S. Germany &amp; Korea also divided. Must take one step at a time, even if ultimate soln not in sight. S. V-N. Govt. regaining confidence: and lull in V-Cong pressure. This may be hopeful.

P.M. Divided soln, or Austrian-type guarantee, may be inevitable: but can‟t judge yet and don‟t rush fences.

F.S. Divided soln must be first step.

Ch. Exch. M.O.D. speaks for large body of public opinion.

P.M. Yes: but F.S.‟s recent visit has pulled U.S. back a bit.

Ch. Exch. I agree: must maintain our friendly pressure.

F.S. And on the other side, as well as on U.S. (wh. is asking for lower price – mere cessation of V-C. pressure – than S-S. bloc, wh. is asking for complete U.S. withdrawal). If V-C. infiltrn ceases – “prompt &amp; assured” – Stevenson offered complete U.S. withdrawal: but problem is “assured”, i.e. verification.

U.S. are being sober &amp; responsible: I hope M-Taylor won‟t be able to press them further.

C.S. Remember C‟w interest in S.E. Asia: we can‟t let U.S. down – note growing Indian apprehension about U.S. withdrawal from V-N.

b) Europe: A.N.F. C.(65) 48.

M.O.D. Justificn for A.N.F. was means of eliminating our indept nuclear dett in way less objectionable to S.U. than M.L.F. But did Gromyko‟s visit confirm this? Or will they oppose it? And how reconcile its purpose with retention of indept capy E. of Suez? (See para. 2(a).)

F.S. S.U. as opposed to A.N.F. as to M.L.F. But may be only a bargaining move. Para. 2(a) is temporary in sense that nuclear guarantee to India not yet settled.

P.M. A.N.F. better for S.U. since M.L.F. wd. have put Germans on m-m fleet, (which is not possible under A.N.F.); and A.N.F. wd. prevent G. from acquiring nuc. weapons – as distinct from treaty prohibition on manufacture. (See para. 9 of C.(65) 48.) M-m. element not fully worked out: but no German finger on trigger. On para. 2(a), I agree with F.S.

S/S. D. That is why some German opinion has attacked A.N.F. And since S.U. oppose N.A.T.O., they must oppose any arrangement of this kind.

On para. 2(a) Chinese nuc. devt will accelerate Indian desire to make n. weapons: then chain reaction, wh. we must try to arrest by taking whatever chance there is of using our n. capy for this purpose.

c) Middle East C.(65) 49.

F.S. As in memm. Nasser has reorganised Egypt: same tendencies in Iran &amp; Israel. But all bedevilled by bitter disputes, wh. are really irrelevant. Our power to influence is less than in 19th C: but must try to damp fires down and keep tension between Israel &amp; Arabs low.

Col. Sec. Need to reassess our policy realistically, in terms of relationship between defence &amp; foreign policy – e.g. Aden &amp; Kuwait; value of CENTO; etc. Cd. we hold balance between Israel &amp; Arabs more positively? Otherwise Israel may kick over traces.

F.S. I warned Eshkol accordingly. Arabs cdn‟t really attack I. at present But German episode has increased tension.

S/S. D. Agree must look closely at Gulf &amp; CENTO: so long as we deliver arms to these allies, can‟t expect others to stop supplying arms to M.E.

F.S. On CENTO, watch overflying rights over Iran. Can‟t just jettison CENTO.

C.S. And peace in M.E. is vital for C‟wealth.

Ch. Exch. Basic question is how to ensure flow of M.E. oil. And watch Kuwait‟s

£ balances, wh. we can‟t expect to manage for ever.
