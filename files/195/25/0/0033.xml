C.C. (65) 40 22 July 1965 10 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip.

L.P. As in Statement. Censure Motion on 2 August.

2. Oversea Affairs (oral).

a) Greece.

F.S. Origin of trouble a left wing cell in Forces (Aspida). Minister (and King) proposed inquiry. Papandreou objected and required dismissal of Minister. King accepted latter but not P. as M. of Defence. Therefore dismissed P. and called on Novas to form new Govt. Riots in favour of P. If now an election P. may campaign on anti-Royalist platform: and Communists might support him. If so, outcome uncertain: but possible threat to N.A.T.O.

b) Rhodesia.

C.S. M/S. C.R.O. gone to Salisbury – only to continue negotns – not to decide.

3. Industrial Dispute: Railways (oral).

M.L. Dispute long-standing: origin in faulty introdn of incentive bonuses in S. Region. Proposals wh. emerged in April reluctantly accepted by ASLEF but rejected by confce. in May. Now deadlock and go slow. Therefore ASLEF must recall confce., even if oppn to schemes maintained. They have agreed to recommend to confce. that negotn shd. continue on basis of highest bonus and lowest redundancy. But recalled confce. won‟t meet until 10 Aug. I have said Govt. can‟t accept go slow until then &amp; must see them again on Monday if no improvement. They will do their best over weekend.

P.M. Can‟t compromise on basic productivity issue – even if official strike.

M.L. If compelled by Monday to call court of inquiry, reconvened confce. may never be recalled! Rates structure in a complete mess: and sitn complicated by ASLEF/N.U.R. tension.

4. Public Service Pensions C.(65) 103.

Ch. Exch. As in memm. Can‟t reject on principle: but can‟t concede in present circs. No compromise scheme possible.

General increase in public service pensions (? from Jan. ‟66) unavoidable soon. Cd. announce in next week‟s C/L. debate: or reserve for Queen‟s Speech. Latter preferable: but cd. indicate, confidentially, in communicating decision on full reckoning.

P.M. Ch. Exch. shd. say “giving favourable considn” in Censure debate.

S/S. D. Qua Service element, announcement shd. be well before Queen‟s Speech.

L.P. Speech &amp; quick legn best – in order to avoid retrospection.

P.M. Say “giving favourable and urgent considn but can‟t anticipate Queen‟s Speech.

M.P. See para. 9. Repercussions on Coal Board, who subsidise Mineworkers‟ Pension Scheme.

Ch. Duchy. Irrelevant – Treasury folklore!

P.M. Otherwise, approve C(65) 103.

M.T. Don‟t under-rate repercussns in transport: pressure in these industries.

P.M. Let wind up speaker in Wed.‟s C/L. debate use our formula – referring to Speech only if necy.

5. Electoral Register C(65) 104.

H.S. As in memm. Too late for second register this year. If autumn register next year, legn necy by Christmas ‟65. Then practicable administratively.

P.M. Second register wd. help Labour Party on timing of Elections. But expensive and complicated by Speaker‟s Confce.

L.P. Politically embarrassing to anticipate Confce., wh. is empowered to consider this. And can‟t rely on L.A.‟s to contribute to cost of second register (as they do to first), since it is of no use to them.

Ch. Exch. Do it in interests of proper functioning of democracy.

S/S. W. I agree.

P.M. Ask Confce. to report quickly on this and on supplemental register (confined to pluses &amp; minuses) in autumn. If they reject, we can act unilaterally.

6. Reforms relating to young people in trouble: draft White Paper C(65) 107. [Enter A.G: M.H.

H.S. Designed to take young people in trouble away from court – by refce. to family council. Only if that fails shd. case go to family court (transformed from existing Juvenile Court). As corollary: (i) approved schools (many based on charitable trusts) shd. be transferred to L.A.‟s.

(ii) 16-21‟s (serious cases apart) shd. be dealt with by same court, with power to send to various kinds of residential estabt. Serious cases will still go to criminal courts.

Family service a wider context – needs further investign, as proposed in para. 7.

Ch. Duchy. Para. 7 disappointing. Cd. establish service without injury. Other Ministers can‟t agree: therefore adopt para. 7.

L. Ch. I agree with Ch. Duchy. A pity proposals considered in two separate halves.

M.H.L.G. Maybe: but mustn‟t bully L.A.‟s. Indept injury essential: family service must be related to other services, and inquiry‟s T. of R. must be wide enough for this.

Ch. Exch. I sympathise with Ch. Duchy &amp; L. Ch.

L.P.S. So do I: but I accept para. 7.

On para. 12, councils may be criticised as amateur “do-gooders”; but not fair – sizeable “expert” element.

On para. 28, note extra social workers.

On .. 41, redraft last sentence – or omit. Avoid any complacency about extra numbers of social workers required (tho‟ absolutely small).

M.H. I agree with M.H.L.G. on para. 7. But:-

a) “personal social services”, i.e. excluding housing.

b) “effective service for every family”.

L.P.S. No: keep “family service” as terms of act.

A.G. I agree. Pity not to deal with this service as a whole.

Col. Sec. I agree. ?Delay action until inquiry complete and can deal as a whole.

S/S. E.S. I support M.H. and M.H.L.G: but accept para. 7.

Ch. Duchy. Inquiry might take at least a year.

P.M. Serious crimes, even if by young children, will continue to be so dealt with?

H.S. Yes.

S/S. S. Make clear W.P. refers only to E. &amp; W. We are proceeding, differently, on basis of Kilbrandon report. Does para. 45 prejudge Home Office‟s final part?

H.S. Clear whole W.P. is only basis of discussion.

F.S. Approved schools for over 16‟s will be run by H.O. But under 16‟s who become 16?

H.S. Will remain in L.A. school.

F.S. Family councils, as proposed, will be middle class. The “other persons” in para. 12 shd. include working class people who have brought up children not to be delinquents. L.A.‟s shd. have discretion on this.

H.S. Accept.

P.M. Accept compromise. Appt. of Cttee. by 3 Ministers (in consultn with Ch. Duchy) not to prejudice qun of ultimate responsy for admn of any family service.

Reconsider title of W.P. – suggestive of unmarried mothers!

Date of publicn depends on W.P. programme as a whole.

Para. 4 of C(65) 107 approved.

S/S. E.S. Ch. Duchy must trust Deptl Ministers! [Exit M. Health.

7. Parliamentary Commission: draft White Paper. C(65) 106.

Ch. Duchy. Drastic revision of order required.

P.M. Leave this to Ch. Duchy. But list in para. 7 shd. not be in an Appx.

P.B.T. Does “personal injustice” in para. 6 comprise bias or maladministration?

P.M. Yes.

L.P.S. Refces. to “Parliament” misleading, if only H/C. Some amdt to show H/C. as the repve House.
