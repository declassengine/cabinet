C.C.(65) 7 5 February 1965. 10.30 a.m.

1. Govt. Expenditure (oral).

P.M. Ch. Secy Tsy, tho‟ not a member of Cab., shd. be regarded as in control of Deptl- expre. If disagreement, must come to Cab. direct (not on appeal to Ch. Exch.) provided Ch. Exch. backs Ch. Secy.

2. Travel by Ministers (oral).

P.M. Major Bills now coming forward. Must therefore conserve voting strength: little scope for o‟sea travel during this period and some proposals may have to be reconsidered. Where permitted, concentrate on week-ends.

Even internal travel must be clearly subject to 3 line Whips.

Keep 16 &amp; 30 March clear.

3. Overseas Affairs (oral).

a) Laos.

F.S. Attempted Right-wing rising defeated.

b) N. V-Nam.

F.S. Kosygin visiting Hanoi: ? offer of air defence equipment in competn with C. China. Also ? warning against escalation and new peace feeler.

c) S. V-Nam.

F.S. Huong sought asylum with our Ambassador. Latter apprehensive; but Khanh regime don‟t seem to object.

d) U. Nations.

F.S. Must try to avoid direct clash, without sacrificing principle. Gen. Assy will probably appoint Conciln Comn to examine future constl &amp; financial aspects of peace-keeping. We will concert T. of R. etc. with U.S. No give in S.U. posn yet: but don‟t despair. Must try to save Gen. Assy: go ahead with T.A. contribn etc.

P.M. Must consider whether U.K. initve possible.

4. Prices and Incomes. C(65) 16. [Enter M.P.B.W.

First Secy As in memm: deadline next Wedy. Voluntary: but compulsion in last resort. ? Parly statement on Thursday. Then begin on stage 3, leading to formal T. of R. for new body.

M. Lab. Concur: must play relations with existing arbitrn machinery by ear.

[Exit M. Lab.

M. Techy If staty powers eventually necy, wd. be available to Tory Govt.

First Secy T.U.C. accept this, as a national requirement. But risk only theoretical since you cdn‟t enforce powers in face of concerted T.U. oppn. Therefore endorse paras. 6 &amp; 18 of statement, particularly 6.

P.M. Reconsider wording of 6? May be inherent in R.Cmn Or cd. be incorporated in T. of R. But it is T.U.C. who have pressed for compulsion – in relation to prices. Might altvely have to consider Select Cttee. (as already for natd industries) for price increases. Therefore “other methods” (wh. leaves it open) right.

M. Techy But cd. compulsion be exercised in relation to award which unions were known to oppose, even before it was given?

First Secy Only arises under para. 18. Board will lay down limits within which claims &amp; settlements can be made: but settlement can only be referred to them by Govt. Also useful to help us in identifying special cases.

So long as we control, no harm. Begin by referring worst price increases &amp; best incomes increases at outset. Then let case law take over.

M. Techy Don‟t build too much on Swedish approach. It went badly wrong in case of one “imposed” settlement.

M.P. Price increases in natd inds. due mainly to “targets”.

First Secy O.K. But watch coal!

Ch. Exch. Posn of public services needs to be further considered. They have established machinery already, wh. we mustn‟t interfere with. But some recent claims v. worrying.

Must proceed by consent. If so, slowly – and other methods will have to be used to restrain pressure of demand wh. will result from threatened rise of 5% in wage demands.

First Secy May be: but keep quiet about it in public. Concentrate now on getting agreement on norms criteria – wh. will have great effect on arbitrators etc.

P.M. Approve.

5. New Town for Manchester. C(65) 13 &amp; 14.

First Secy As in C.(65) 13. Must be some provision for growth in non-depressed areas if economic devt to go ahead. Understandably unwelcome to Devt Area Ministers. But no real threat to them on basis of 25% growth in five years. And in any case incentives for D.A.‟s will have to be extended to non D.A.‟s as well. And something must be done, urgently, for M‟chester.

P.B.T. Agree: but don‟t do it in a way wh. weakens D.A.‟s or prejudices review of D.A. policy.

Must get unused resources into use if we are to meet &amp; moderate demand. Must re-enact Local Empt Act by ‟67: and review will take account of this.

Must wait for results of N.W. Study.

L. Ch. scheme can‟t go ahead till 1970‟s anyhow. Resources ought not to be diverted to non D.A. areas.

Therefore concentrate on towns nearest M‟chester, wh. wd. solve part of problem particularly if incorporates office devt.

M.H.L.G. M‟chester is only large centre with no new town. Risley a mere suburb of Warrington and anyhow liable to subsidence. New growth point for M‟chester needed; and, even if not till 1970‟s, will be psychological incentive to N.W., to match our announcement about southern England. But must be presented as growth point, not merely allevn of housing problem – wh. we must alleviate, as best we can in short term, by Risley &amp; W‟loughton.

[Exeunt First Secy &amp; M.P.

S/S. S. Same sort of thing needed in Scotland. But ought to wait for national Plan first. Net emigrn from Scotland a record last year – 41,000. And industry will have to be steered to M‟chester new town. This will only aggravate Scots. loss of manpower. [Enter M/S. D.E.A.

S/S. W. Must overhaul Local Empt Act. In Wales coal mining declining; and other empt opportunities contracting – e.g. in steel as result of new methods. Therefore national Plan must allocate fair shares of growth, before any are pre-empted.

Ch. Exch. But must we have Risley/W‟loughton &amp; new growth point?

M.H.L.G. Yes: former will deal only with slum clearance. Must have new growth point as well.

Ch. Exch. But one project must be economic – more so than two.

M.P.B.W. N.W. needs a growth point as much as S.E.

Ch. Exch. Deal with short term problem by R/W: leave Chorley until comprehensive plan for N.W. ready. Otherwise, growth points will be created piecemeal, as result of regional political pressures.

P.M. Some industry ought to be moved from M‟chester. Industries at Preston and Chorley are growth industries. M‟chester problem must be settled; and City Council &amp; County Council for once in agreement. Can‟t wait for national Plan before settling anything. S.E. announcement must be matched by N.W. announcement: and plans for Scot. &amp; W. shd. be speeded up – and so announced.

But Ch. Exch. right on o‟heads duplicn. ? Do it all by L/Ch.

M.H.L.G. Wdn‟t deal with slum clearance. For this must have short term short haul soln. But ready to omit refce to new legn.

P.B.T. ? Approve L/Ch. as long-term objective: but omit financial inducements and merely say considering plans for producing empt by offices &amp; industry from M‟chester.

S/S. S. But say nothing about S. or W., wh. might draw attention to them.

M.H.L.G. Agree: present primarily as housing announcement in two phases. No emphasis on financial incentives to attract industry wh. ought to be going to S. &amp; Wales. [Exit M.P.B.W.

6. Doctors‟ Pay (oral). Enter M.H.

M.H. Propose, as in ED(Pl) report, accept Review Body‟s recmns – linked with improvements in general practice. Doctors may not accept!

Ch. Exch. I agree. But April ‟62 award was for 3 years. This is 9% a year ahead of the date. Average will have risen from £2465 to £3012 between 1960 and now. So doctors can‟t complain. And new award only for a year!

M.H. And then a general reassessment – wh. will take account of this interim award. But justified by fall in number of doctors per head of popn.

S/S. ES. Won‟t help with teachers – whom we are trying to hold to a 2 year settlement.

M. Tech. And watch repercussions on engineers, who will have been outsmarted by doctors. Underlines ambiguity of our new incomes policy.

S/S. S. As educn Minister for Scotland, I have a 3 year agt with Scottish teachers!

P.M. But have no option but to agree.

M.H. Can‟t find savings to finance compensn proposal. ?But say will do it when circs. allow.

Ch. Exch. No: that means in a few months‟ time! No hurry to deal with claim outstanding for 17 years. But I wd. concede review, without commitment, in 12 months – as part of reassessment. [Exit M.H.

7. Farm Price Review C(65) 15.

Ch. Duchy As in memm. Complete disagreement. Political issue – not only qua row with farmers but also qua row with workers‟ unions.

Need we worry too much about milk? Price increase wd. not affect consumpn (since incomes are already adjusting themselves to price increases); and they are not necy bad where no extra demand on resources or imports wd. result.

Concede something – on “without prejudice” basis – i.e. start at +£3m. (a concession in itself) and stick at +£10m. provided reviews agreed in other respects (including ½d on milk). If not agreed, Cab.‟s right to impose a settlement wd. be reserved.

M.A.F.F. I would be content.

Ch. Exch. Better ways of spending £10m. for political reasons! And what is at stake is £20m.! Once we indicate +£10m., we shd. never get back to +£3m. We are entitled to take full pound of flesh in exceptional year: and this year is exceptional. Therefore stick at +£3m.

M.H.L.G. But milk prodn is under threat; and diversion of dairy herds to beef v. serious. Therefore I support Ch. Duchy, provided it is presented correctly on basis of milk.

S/S. S. Row with farmers inevitable anyhow. I support Ch. Duchy.

S/S. W. So do I. Milk problem real and serious.

F.S. If we increase butter, may annoy Danes – to prejudice of E.F.T.A. relations. On general grounds, I support Ch. Exch.

C.S. N.Z. Govt. exercised about their butter. Therefore if milk price must be increased, try to prevent it from spreading to butter expansion.

M.A.F.F. N.Z. wd. accept modest increase: more concerned to prevent quota increases for Denmark – and ?U.S.

P.B.T. 30% of our milk makes butter – wh. causes difficulties with Denmark etc. There cannot be any risk of shortage of milk.

S/S. S. An aspect of periodicity of course! In Scot. creameries are underemployed; and we ought to produce more butter.

M. Tech. Periodicity in incomes/prices adjustment also. Some increases in incomes are not mopped up by price increases: and vice versa.

Ch. Exch. Don‟t perpetuate existing pattern of agriculture. We ought to start now to reform it.

M.A.F.F. For this, we must have confidence and co-opn.

L.P.S. I support Ch. Exch.

H.S. And I the Ch. Duchy – if only because of N.I.

M.T. And I the Ch. Duchy. Can‟t risk shortage of milk in winter, even if we must risk surplus in summer.

M.H.L.G. Therefore must concede increase large enough to prevent slaughter. 1d the minimum for this.

P.M. On balance, endorse Ch. Duchy‟s plan – but “without prejudice”.
