C.C. (65) 47 [Chequers] 12 September 1965 3 p.m.

[Enter Ch. Whip: M.H: M.P.N.I: M.P.B.W. M. Avn: M.L.N.R:

P.M.G: Pay M.G.

1. Rhodesia (oral).

C.S. Reviewed past history since Oct. 64. Smith‟s overtures to self &amp; L. Ch. later rejected by Party caucus. General election. M/S. C.R.O.‟s mission showed Smith still retreating. Offered to visit Salisbury as part of C. Africa. S. appeared to accept: but latest tels. show hardening again on basis of proposals for indepce as condition of visit.

L. Ch. Agree. U.D.I. probably not immediately imminent. But S. under heavy pressure to ask us to acquiesce in R.‟s leaving C‟w. and becoming indept.

P.M. S. now a prisoner of his Right Wing. All other C‟w. Govts endorsed our Statement of Oct. ‟64. Many foreign Govts also. Only S.A. &amp; Portugal wd. support Rh. Latter complicated by question of Rh. represn in Lisbon, and by Port. ability to impede help for Zambia in event of U.D.I.

If Z. mines were halted, U.K. industry wd. suffer badly.

In present circs., C.S. shd. prob. go to S. at once and press S. to come to London. If S. rejects both, he must be seen to be in the wrong.

May need to recall Parlt at short notice – despite difficulties about Speaker. Cab. must delegate authy to Rh. Cttee.

No question of military intervention: but U.N. action likely, and, since Rh. Govt. wd. be illegal, we shd. be expected to endorse.

2. Kashmir (oral).

C.S. Past history. Blame divided hitherto – culminating in R. of K. episode. In August both crossed cease fire line: and I. crossed intl frontier. I. hopes to eliminate problem of K. by convincing P. that cease fire line is permanent. P. hopes to reopen whole issue on basis of plebiscite – U.N.I.C. Resns etc.

We are blamed by both sides – best proof of impartiality – and are pressing both to support U. Thant. Also stopped arms shipments. If war continues, civilians may be involved. U. Thant shd. report to Secy C. next week: chances of cease fire remote. U.N. sanctions may then be proposed.

C‟w. initiative, which rest of C‟w. wd. back, shd. wait on U. Thant.

U.K. subjects being looked after.

P.M. Any C‟w. initiative must certainly wait on U.N. action.

Pay M. Gen. 1962 Agt on arms supply to I. entitles us to informn about use of arms and their return when no longer required against China. In terms of our own needs, we cd. now claim return if enquiry shows that they are not being used against China.

C.S. I. P.M. has assured us of this already.

M.O.D. We are holding up despatch of technical personnel and delaying new aid agts. But these shd. not be means of sanctions, wh. depend on U.N.

Any other action on this front – e.g. E.C.G.D. cover – shd. be similarly determined.

P.B.T. E.C.G.D. cover no longer justified in terms of commercial risk. But not yet decided.

P.M. Yes: no unilateral action (other than admve delay) on sanctions front.
