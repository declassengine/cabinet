C.C. (65) 49 23 September l965 10.30 a.m.

1. Oversea Affairs (oral).

a) Kashmir.

C.S. P.M.‟s messages contributed largely to cease-fire: also other C‟w. messages. But main initiative a U.N. one, with C‟w. support. Clearly right. Pak. v. reluctant but came into line. S.U. intervention not necy bad: let them try where we &amp; others have failed. Final settlement must involve U.N.

Much anti-British feeling in India: pressure for withdrawal from C‟w. But Pak. equally bitter.

b) Rhodesia.

C.S. Still simmering: farmers pressing for u.d.i. in next few weeks. It may therefore happen. But I shall try to visit S‟bury. first – or get him here. He now threatens to come here at short notice.

2. Political Contributions. C(65) 124. [Enter M.O.D: Att. Gen.

P.B.T. Agreed to be dealt with in Jenkins Bill. But by accountants or in Directors‟ Report? Unanimous advice in favour of latter, particularly given existing penalties for inadequate reports.

Ch. Duchy. May get better publicity.

F. S/S. But leaves directors free to decide what is political contribn?

P.B.T. Not if Bill drafted properly and courts maintain it.

P.M. Approve. [Exit Att. Gen.

2. Foreign Policy (oral).

F.S. Consider in terms of objectives (rather than areas) – to maintain Atlantic Alliance: to promote détente between Alliance &amp; Warsaw Pact: to promote disarmt: and to strengthen U.N.

N.A.T.O: de G. ambivalent. But, tho‟ endorsing Alliance, will proby wish to change N.A.T.O. by excluding troops under foreign command from France. Alliance then becomes system of guarantees without any integrated joint planning. N.A.T.O. cd. exist without France: but considerable rearrangement required.

E.E.C. Hitherto France has always won. But on most recent dispute she has not won: and we must encourage this, in order to prevent an inward looking Community, wh. wd. complicate N.A.T.O. issue. But note impact of E.E.C. disorder and E.F.T.A. initiative.

Germany. Important qua N.A.T.O. and E. Europe: if tension with latter persists, more difficult to get N.A.T.O. tension with Warsaw Pact eased. But must keep G. in N.A.T.O., particy if France rocky. New G. Govt‟s constn uncertain: but fact that elections are over opens up new possibilities. Poland (my visit) still opposed to G. reunificn: but hope now G. Govt. will try to improve relations. Right soln wd. be reunificn within present frontiers: and new Govt. might endorse this.

U.S. and N.A.T.O. U.S. unpredictable – see Dominica where they overplayed their hand and we had to bring them under U.N. and O.A.S. aegis. U.S. intervenn was necy to prevent disorder: but, if they had had their own way, resultant Govt. wd. have been unsatisfy. As result of our intervenn, a middle course has been found. We must draw moral for other sitns: U.S. policy can be misjudged but their power is needed to keep world peace &amp; order. China may be a test case.

E. Europe &amp; disarmt. Can‟t promote disarmt in Europe without N.A.T.O. agreement. But N.A.T.O. not initially receptive to our ideas; and much persuasion still needed. Attitude of S.U. v. important: but this depends on V-Nam and on their objection to MLF/ANF concept. But some tensions eased: Art. 19 dispute: ANF Kashmir opens up new scope for collabn between S.U. &amp; West. Don‟t let C‟w. amour-propre spoil this, since our basic interests coincide with those of S.U., which is bound to play increasing part in Asian affairs. Some Indian swing to S.U. inevitable. But I shall try in N.Y. to bring Soviet initve within U.N. framework

On disarmt, our A.N.F. project went some way to satisfying German aspirations without putting her finger on nuclear trigger: and it provided means of disposing of our own nuclear force. But S.U. opposed to any new nuclear force. This will probably continue to wreck any chance of non-dissenn treaty. But A.N.F. might not be agreed by N.A.T.O. anyway. Will new G. Govt. accept McNamara altve – i.e. consultation without new force? We must support this. But, if so, what happens to our own nuclear force? Must consider in due course, meanwhile promoting extension of Test Ban Treaty and supporting world disarmt confce. and trying to strengthen U.N. authority and power to intervene in disturbed situations. On Art. 19, financial support, Cttee of 24, we have backed U.N: and we must keep this up.

M. East. A classic case of area where relaxn of tension wd. promote world peace. We are trying to withdraw in orderly fashion – e.g. by promoting greater co-opn among Gulf Rulers &amp; sending M/S. on M.E. tours. Iran an obstacle, in view of hostility with Egypt. Any Gulf settlement must be acceptable to Iran. This will not easily be sold to Nasser: but we must try to convince him of our real purposes in S. Arabia.

F. East &amp; S.E. Asia. No need to explain objectives in V-Nam. No sign of disposition by NV-N. to negotiate. Must let sitn remain as is. Japan will become more important in the area: but little scope for their medn in confrontn yet. Confrontn at present insoluble, unless we abandon Malaysian Fedn: and that involves U.S., Austr. &amp; N.Z. In long term, we must be out of F.E. and face sitn in which vacuum will be filled by some Power not friendly to West but not wholly under Chinese influence.

That epitomises our posn – we have less power and influence than we had in (19th C. We can act only with allies. But on this basis we can still exert considerable influence – particularly over U.S. policies. Must therefore push N.A.T.O. towards détente with East: and that means settling our future relations with Europe – E.E.C./E.F.T.A. complex etc. And we must continue to back U.N.

S/S. D. F.O. doesn‟t have to pay for, or administer, the results of its policies. Hence reluctant to establish priorities – wh. are vital to spending Depts, as shown by defence review. In 10 years‟ time, we shan‟t be able to maintain even an indept contribn to military activity E. of Suez – for economic &amp; demographic reasons and as result of spread of technology to small Powers.

Therefore advantageous if S.U. more involved in problems of Asia, both as means of containing China, and as means of reinforcing Gt. Power control of arms supplies to small countries. But S.U. won‟t co-operate in this, if we continue to supply: hence re-examine value of CENTO and SEATO.

On disarmt, non-diss. agt of little value, since countries won‟t give nuclear weapons to other countries anyway. General arms control in areas such as Europe more important: but Germany wdn‟t cooperate except on assurance of nuclear protection. Hence importance of A.N.F., wh. wd. be worth pursuing, if G. wd. take it, despite McNamara.

M.H.L.G. Altho‟ Anglo-German relations important, this need not mean opposing E.Gy even more – wh. wd. make reunificn impossible. It only makes sense if W. &amp; E. Gy are prepared to live together. We mustn‟t support W.Gy myth that only form of reunificn is absorption of E.Gy in W.Gy. Divided Gy really suits us: and we shd. accept it, for sake of relations with S.U., rather than seek to promote a reunified Germany which, on realistic basis, wd. have to be neutralised.

F. S/S. S.P.D. foreign policy – if they had won election – wd. have accepted co-existence with E.Gy, getting new status (? Free City) for Berlin as prize.

C.S. No real inconsistency between C‟w. links and closer ties with Europe. Must decide whether we want latter or not. [Exit F. S/S.

S/S. W. Future of Malaysia, now S‟pore has left Fedn? And any chance of bringing China or V-Nam in U.N.?

Ch. Duchy Shd. we revise our “conditions” for entering Europe? – e.g. independent foreign policy: C‟w. interest. ? New study of technological advantages of closer links with Europe. Little future in attempts to maintain political or economic independence – or in illusions about value of C‟w. connection.

L.P.S. How would be go into Europe, if we wanted to?

M.O.D. F.S‟s report disappointing to Party: we have simply accepted C‟sive policies – e.g. on A.N.F. – wh. S.U. won‟t accept. If so, can‟t leave open qun of our own nuclear weapons, both inside &amp; beyond Europe.

This is not an opportune moment to seek re-entry into Europe, whose agl policy has proved unacceptable to Germany and wd. be even more so to us, as necessarily entailing disastrous trading policies; and whose principles of free movement of labour etc. cannot be reconciled with our Plan.

P.M. Our record on foreign policy is defensible. We have killed M.L.F: and lack of progress on German problems inhibited by elections. Meanwhile we have improved relations with U.S., who have not tried to attach political conditions to economic and financial support.

But can now resume considn of European détente: and U Thant regards us as U.N.‟s best supporter. Our initiative on V-Nam was valuable and can be revived: ditto on Rann of Kutch and, covertly, on Kashmir. We have restored relations with France and taken new E.F.T.A. initiative. Only frozen area round Germany remains: and we can now tackle this – on basis which is different from C‟tive policy. If A.N.F. fails, our nuclear weapons can be disposed of otherwise.

H.S. How deep is Sino-Soviet rift? If irreconcilable, what is its significance for us? Cd. we win back S.U. to West &amp; U.N.?

P.B.T. Paralysis in E.E.C. threatens K. Round. On re-entry into Europe, ready to re-discuss. But E.F.T.A. is a large market: and E.E.C. is not an obstacle to our trade, wh. has risen sharply since Rome Treaty. Japan rising rapidly: but wants to be indept of U.S.

On China &amp; U.N. can‟t assume China wd. now wish to join – except on unacceptable terms.

M. Techy Agree on reconsidn of entry into Europe. But E.E.C.‟s willingness to cooperate techy is limited to cases where we are ahead. Conditions for re-entry don‟t exist at present. Only defence cuts will release resources for our own techl devt, wh. we must provide for internally before we consider assocn with Europe – on basis of acceptance of Rome Treaty, wh. is only realistic basis.

F.S. We have lost power of indept action. We must work by influence on our allies. Qua A.N.F., we face two blocks – German hesitations and Soviet opposition. But we were right to try.

Longer term demographic factors cut both ways. Poor countries are belligerent because they have nothing to lose. Therefore when we have to retreat, e.g. in S.E. Asia, we must draw line somewhere against policy of solving economic problems by aggression, provided we are ready to help with aid.

Little chance of bringing VN. Problem within U.N. in view of Chinese opposition and doubts about China‟s willingness to join U.N.

On Sino-Soviet dispute, China wants to continue it. But S.U. doesn‟t enjoy it: and we must not exploit it, except where S.U. is forced by circumstances to side with West.

Non dissemn treaties not unimportant. Temptation to arm third countries with nuclear weapons will always remain: and undertaking by non-n. countries not to acquire has psychological value.

Conventional arms redn also important. This depends on G. attitude. We mustn‟t encourage their ambitions for frontier revision: but desire for reunificn is not a myth – and is indeed foundation of lasting peace. Free elections wd. be right way. And wd. coexistence of E. &amp; W. G. be meaningful in relation e.g. to Berlin?

P.M. Must be by détente, in which W.G. may have to give something up, provided they get reunificn in return – not merely coexistence of two disparate entities. Must reconsider our policy towards G. in light of elections and in consultn with U.S.

F.S. On E.E.C., I agree no scope for approach now. But might reconsider conditions on wh. we could re-enter.

P.M. Must also be clear whether u.d.i. wd. be domestic or intl problem?

On Europe, entry into E.E.C. will intensify techl competn, wh. we aren‟t yet ready to meet. Re-evaln of conditions of entry desirable as a continuing matter: but agd factors clear – addn to B/P. and disruption of C‟w. trade. But not a starter at present, in any case: we must keep out of the internal row and emphasise techl collabn and bridge bldg. We must keep freedom to plan –

otherwise we shd. be at mercy of deflationists in E.E.C. Therefore ask ourselves what are conditions on wh. we cd. currently enter Rome and cd. we get them.

Repeat this debate periodically.
