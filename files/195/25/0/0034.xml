C.C. (65) 41 27 July 1965 10 a.m.

1. Economic Situation C(65) 113. [Enter Ch. Whip.

P.M. B/P. shd. improve – practically halved this year. But external factors have provoked new run on £. Moreover, economy really overheated, mainly in L.A. field, as result of pre-election spending spree of previous Govt. Therefore must moderate, by creating not unempt but redeployment. Uncertain whether it will suffice qua confidence: but certainly not less than this is needed for that purpose, and to approach more nearly to balance by end ‟66.

Ch. Exch. G. included by error: refce. to Govt.‟s own economies omitted – reinstate.

S/S. E.S. If underlying economic tendency downwards, this may aggravate. If counterpart is U.S.aid in longer term, political price will be exacted.

Any altve –

a) devaluation: but ec Ministers have rejected.

b) direct easing of B/P. by cuts in o‟sea expdre., tighter exchange control and heavier measures (financial or physical) against imports.

Package only acceptable if prelude to (b) in autumn.

M. Techy I agree. Basic philosophy of package wrong. If balance by end - ‟66, what is need for all this?

Ch. Exch. Because we shan‟t be in balance by end - ‟66.

F. S/S. And because problem is short-term one of confidence in next few weeks – i.e. problem of reinforcing immediate confidence at cost of minimum damage to domestic economy in longer term.

P.M. Import controls must be retained – surcharge or Q.R.‟s. But that is relevant to next year‟s B/P., not to immediate posn. Last published reserves less than £1,000 m. On Th. &amp; Fri. we lost 1/10th. We cd. lose balance in a week or so.

Ch. Exch. Even so, not only lack of confidence in Br. Govt. It is lack of confidence in management of Br. economy. Further measures of disinflation, even at cost of slowing down ec. growth, are needed if we are to be in balance by end ‟66. A return to Selwyn Lloyd in 1961? Yes – I accept this.

M.T. Bad package in tone and balance: will not inspire confidence either at home or abroad.

M.H.L.G. I agree – we shall be in same posn in another month or two. Foreign opinion will expect cuts in personal consumpn – regulator etc. And Labour Party will expect cuts in o‟sea defence expre. rather than disruption of bldg. indy – which may be needed in long term but will have minimal impact on intl confidence in short term.

Ch. Exch. Two Budgets have already hit the consumer. Regulator wd. increase C/L index that and wd. ruin p. &amp; i. policy. I might yield + £200m. – 2d on tobacco, 1d on beer 3d on petrol and 10% on P. Tax.

P.M. And, if direct taxn, 3rd Fin. Bill wd. be needed. If on income tax wd. be no better than cutting back L.A. cap. expre. Latter more reassuring to intl opinion.

F. S/S. I agree. Intl opinion is concentrated on excessive public spending. Increase in personal taxn leads to general deflation without affecting real cause of trouble (assuming devaln ruled out).

Ch. Exch. Confidence brings money back to London; and that copes with immediate sitn. But only possible if underlying balance satisfy: and that depends (aid and defence apart) on export/import ratio and increase in exports depends on reducing overheating in economy.

P.B.T. I agree. Demand &amp; incomes too high to enable us to cure B/P. Regulator irrelevant and impracticable. Therefore adopt these measures, wh. are not deflationary (devaln wd. be better than defln) but only mildly disinflationary. Recent downturn of economy not enough: but, if it gets out of hand, we can adjust in autumn by regulator.

P.M. Remember imports already practically stabilised: but depends on continn of surcharge or quotas.

L.P.S. May have to accept package. But doubtful whether will re-establish confidence: how do we cope with next run on £?

P.M. Some considn being given to this. Must hope that meantime, run stops.

M.O.D. Perhaps we shd. have devalued in Oct. Are we now simply postponing that decision until last – and worst – moment? If so, our political posture will be indefensible. Therefore package unacceptable unless we substitute, quickly, import controls and defence cuts as proposed by S/S. E.S., and avoid retaining, at U.S. behest, defence commitments which are basic cause of our troubles.

C.S. Devaln wrong. A Labour Govt. cdn‟t survive a second Labour devaln. But will package suffice to avert this? If not, shd. be strengthened: otherwise, we may face an Election in hopeless posture of weakness.

P.M. Agree devaln, even with deflation, wd. not solve the problem – wh. derives basically from fluidity of large part of £ balances, exposing us to the risk of successive devalns as pressure grows with decline of confidence.

Ch. Exch. Hence importance of making new arrangements for stabilising the long-term £ balances.

M.P. Priv. investt needs to be tackled on wider front than constrn. Quality of investt in machinery etc. needs to be examined, in terms of value for exports, import saving etc.

P.M. Can‟t appear to cut down productive capacity: and adminvely impossible (except in war) to control e.g. machine tools in detail.

Col. Sec. Section on imports too weak; also section on defence.

M.A.F.F. Reject devaln. But don‟t cut growth points – research and modernisation. Provided these are safeguarded, I accept.

P.M. I agree: no cuts in research or innovation.

M. Techy But you can‟t isolate them. And we are to go on importing foreign computers!

P.M. I meant D.S.I.R. stations etc. – wh. shd. benefit from reduction of o‟heating in constrn indy.

Ch. Duchy. Is this Statement necy at this time? Can‟t we wait for Plan in Sept? Statement is indistinguishable from those of Tory Govts! Why no refce. to personal consumpn? Regulator shd. be used; and stern call to public opinion by the P.M. is necy, bringing facts home to man in the street by hitting him direct.

F. S/S. Action essential to protect reserves, wh. are now v. vulnerable.

S/S. W. But will package certainly produce balance by end ‟66?

Ch. Exch. I can‟t promise: and I am not sure.

But confidence won‟t be really restored until wages and prices are under control.

P.M. Yes. Director of I.M.F. recommends statutory freeze for 6 months. But politically doubtful and admvely unenforceable against massive union support for a wage claim.

F. S/S. And wd. provoke unofficial leadership in unions, in competn with official leadership. And control of profits (necy counterpart) wd. be resented by o‟sea opinion.

M. Lab. I support Ch. Exch. We shd. compel claims, in last resort, to go to P. and I. Board. We have spoiled our own wicket by conceding increases to M.P.s, judges etc. And voluntary policy is breaking down, on restrictive practices as well as wages. Devlin Report may give us our chance.

P.M. Even P. and I. Board refce. not a substitute for this package. And vague refce. to further action counter-productive.

M. Avn Long term implicns of proposals disturbing – rejection of our basic philosophy of growth and retreat into posn in wh. we are perpetually sacrificing growth to periodic B/P. crises. If we adopt this package, we must at least study urgently means of avoiding this next time – studies of devaln, wage-freeze, drastic cuts of defence commitments.

P.M. All these in hand, particularly defence, where now clear that we can‟t maintain present commitments without aid. A sprat to catch a mackerel? Maybe: I have an open mind, pending intl discussns wh. will be required v. soon.

F.S. Devaln out for reasons given. Inaction will lead to complete disaster. Therefore package unavoidable: and, so far from inhibiting growth, will make more room for it. And discriminatory approach avoids any charge of reversion to stop-go: as also sharp refce. to defence expre. More drastic

measures proposed as altve may be needed in longer-term: but they are not altves to immediate action envisaged.

S/S. D. I agree: case for such action unassailable. But no assurance of success: and must therefore use breathing space to best advantage. But must not publicly retract from published growth rate. On defence, margin to be cut is £400 m., not £500 m., by ‟69-70. The £118m. for next year may be confused by price assumptions for purposes of comparison. If a bigger cut, sharp practice!

Ch. Exch. No: I never accepted lower figure. Must explore rapidly.

S/S. D. On longer term, savings within present commitments now exhausted. Commitments must now be reorganised – in Aden, colonial territories, Malaysia etc. I have proposed means for this in defence review; and these must be considered. Otherwise, no chance of real savings.

S/S. S. I accept Statement: and sufficiently discriming to avoid S-Lloyd charge.

M. Techy I challenge assumpn that we must create unempt. Are capital cuts to affect e.g. Dungeness „B‟?

P.M. Only non-industrial projects are to be affected.

M. Techy But proposals are meaningless, qua cap. cuts and h.p. A retreat from all our philosophy. Better altve is increase in direct taxn.

P.M. Nothing here to affect prodve cap. expre: proposals are designed to make room for it.

M. Techy They will affect prodn: unempt already rising, in advance of seasonal trend. We are in danger of doing things twice, like S.Lloyd.

Ch. Whip. ? Insert some refce. to Plan as positive provision for growth. Equate inc. guarantee, health charges &amp; mortgages as not to be done in coming Session.

P.M. Agree. On main issue, must adopt this package as only means of averting immediate disaster. Longer-term measures on imports etc, will be examined and must be decided in autumn. For package, regulator is irrelevant and electorally unwise. Cuts in L.A. expre. shd. be electorally popular.

M.P.B.W. Maybe: but will involve unempt and some reassurance to bldg. indy essential in Statement.

M. Techy I vote against Statement.

S/S. E.S. I accept it only if altve measures worked out for future.

P.M. I agree.

M.H.L.G. And provided Cab. are properly consulted in advance in future.

P.M. I accept.

M.O.D. I support M.H.L.G: we need a Chequers week-end on basic political and economic strategy, e.g. in preparation for Plan or Queen‟s Speech.

Draft Statement considered para. by para.

M.P.N.I. On deferment of I.G. scheme, palliate by proposal to create Dept. of Social Secy.

P.M. Give me a form of words for Thursday‟s debate.

Ch. Duchy. Shdn‟t prejudice discussion of I.G. v. w-r. benefits.

S/S. E.S. But deferment is only for next year.

P.M. Consider in detail at next Cab.

M.P.B.W. Private investt shd. be £150,000.

P.M. No: £100,000.

Other amdts. agreed.

Ch. Exch. P.M. shd. make Statement – for sake of impact overseas.

L.P. And for sake of Party morale.

P.M. No: avoid impression of divided Cab., since Ch. expected to make it.
