C.C. (65) 25 13 April 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral).

L.P. As in statement.

2. Oversea Affairs (oral).

a) Viet-Nam.

F.S. Peking rejected G-W: hostile reply to our request for views on settlement, on ground our backing of U.S. makes us no longer a co-chairman. Have said in effect – think again. They won‟t: and G-W. will now visit only non-Comm. countries. Still valuable. Peking also rebuffed mediation by Secy Gen. U.N. But S.U. have suggested confce. on Cambodia – backdoor to V.N. Will U.S. back this?

P.M. to explore in W‟ton.

b) Berlin.

F.S. Sitn now normal: clear Soviet action only protest. Must maintain right to have (infrequent) Bundestag meetings in Berlin. Have made clear no more this year – even Bundesrat in summer.

c) Rhodesia.

P.M. U.D.I. more probable after election.

C.S. Yes: Cab. probably rejected Smith‟s initiatives and S. therefore decided on election as prelude to U.D.I., as compromise. I am considering whether any initiatives we can take.

P.M. Must have our measures ready after Easter.

L. Ch. Smith has not necessarily gone back on his offers to us. His party may split.

3. B.B.C. Finance. C.(65) 61. [Enter P.M.G: M/S. D.E.A.

P.M.G. As in memm. No need to hurry into colour, in view of deadlock in Vienna; and therefore possible to accept, for the moment, moderate increase proposed, with review including evasion, controlled advertising, payment for educl use etc. ? Also possibility of control – not over content of programmes but over whole pattern of devt.

P.M. ? Increase revenue from publicns. And do B.B.C. still finance whole of capital expre. from revenue a/c?

P.M.G. Trouble is increased cap. expre. leads not to more revenue (unlike I.T.V.) but to more expre!

L.P. 66% of viewing popn pay nothing (I.T.V.): other 34% have to pay the lot. £2 increase really necy: but compromise on £1, with review. Don‟t cut B.B.C. back more than necy. What about Channel 4? If for B.B.C., more expre. But might have joint B.B.C./I.T.A. use for ?univy of the air – even if finance has to be provided partly by advt.

P.M. Might be educl trust, of B.B.C., I.T.V. univs. etc: if a profit, might subvent B.B.C. Can‟t just increase B.B.C. licence indefinitely.

Ch. Exch. Consider possy of advt more generally in relation to B.B.C. And their control of expre. shd. be improved.

Ch. Duchy. Aged and afflicted rely on sound radio. ? Hold this licence as is and increase T.V. licence more – even to £6. One bite at cherry best, despite incomes &amp; prices policy.

M. Techy In principle, agree. But bad after W.P. on prices &amp; incomes, especially if devt (colour etc.) stationary until after review. Review shd. have come first – and then whatever increase necy to maintain devt. Advt on B.B.C. bad in principle: mustn‟t go back on this.

L.P. Sound licences are held by young, with transistors: not by aged etc.

P.M. On M. Tech.‟s point, ? let colour devt go ahead on basis of borrowing &amp; higher fee, wh. wd. service loan.

P.M.G. Technical reasons – Vienna breakdown – against colour. And extra licence wd. have to be £5.

P.M. Then emphasise technical reasons.

P.M.G. Also may have to pay licence to France, if SECAM system adopted. Therefore defer decision on colour until after review, i.e. end July.

S/S. W. No advt on B.B.C. – particularly if wholesale as Ch. Exch. suggests.

M.A.F.F. I support M. Tech. Better to wait till after review than have two bites.

M.P. And wait till B.B.C.2 coverage complete.

C.S. Or go for £6 now, if inevitable soon.

P.M.G. Depends on extent of B.B.C. advt – wh. wd. be acceptable as a support to a public service, not main or only source of finance.

P.B.T. Don‟t underprice public services. At least take £1 increase.

Ch. Exch. No - £6: unless review will comprise qun of B.B.C. advt.

P.M.G. Regional diffce in fee not practicable. In fact urban viewers subsidise remote rural viewers.

P.M. Can‟t decide on B.B.C. advt at this stage. Equally can‟t contemplate annual increases in licence indefinitely. Therefore accept £5 now: review shd. comprise university of air, control of expre., etc.

M.O.D. Present positively: emphasise measures against evasion: weight savings scheme for O.A.P.‟s, whose increase is being eroded.

P.M.G. But many O.A.P.‟s live with families: same scope for abuse as tobacco tokens. N.A.B. may be able to help: G.P.O. can‟t.

I will redraft statement, stressing evasion.

P.M. And on rented sets, licence shd. be responsy of renting firms by addn to rental. This wd. curtail evasion.

P.M.G. And B.B.C. shd. co-operate more in reminding viewers about licence.

P.M. And anybody buying a set shd. produce licence first.

L. Ch. Addl args. for deferring any increase until after review – when all facts and possibilities will be clear.

M/S. D.E.A. Scope for savings as result of review not large.

P.M. At least base postponement of colour on technical grounds.

£5 now: reconsider in July in light of review comprising result of Minl‟s Cttee. on univy of air, pirates etc.
