C.C. (65) 10. 18 February 1965. 10 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral).

L.P. As in statement.

2. Overseas Affairs (oral).

a) Viet-Nam.

F.S. Br. subjects in remoter parts of S. V-Nam, being warned privately to leave or move to Saigon.

Sov. Govt. making cautious move towards reviving co-chairmanship of 1954 Confce. If so, U.S. Govt. must indicate kind of confce. wh. wd. be acceptable (not necy reconvening of ‟54 confce.) and terms on which they wd. negotiate.

b) Europe.

F.S. Recent visit to Brussels. Talks with Spaak &amp; Hallstein. S. presses us to enter E.E.C. He accepts Eur. defence unrealistic without U.S. – but is still afraid of de G.

H. accepts our refusal to enter E.E.C.

On Art. 19 &amp; V-Nam., S. in sympathy with us.

c) U.A.R.

F.S. Will shortly consult O.P.D. on relations with U.A.R. Current dialogue intended to lead to U.K. Minl visit to Cairo in few months‟ time – by Thompson. But must not rock boat qua Israel &amp; other Arab states. Therefore all Ministers shd. be v. careful.

d) Turkey.

F.S. No change in Turkish policy likely. But while internal politics in T. uncertain, greater risk of T. intervention in Cyprus.

P.M. We are keeping close to U.S. on V-Nam: hope to report soon to Cab.

M.O.D. U.A.R. Amb. has approached me v. cordially. ? Attempt to obtain more techl assce. Shd. I respond?

F.S. Yes – but not too warmly. Consult me separately.

C.S. U.A.R. repve in N.Y. told me they welcome our overtures: not to worry too much about Israel.

e) U. Nations.

F.S. Agreed procedure stymied by different Albanian proposal. Original suggn – committee to examine all aspects of peace-keeping – likely to be reinstated. If so, G. Assy must adjourn, since can‟t meet &amp; vote without calling in question whole principle. But Secy C. &amp; specialised agencies shd. continue.

C.S. I agree in light of visit to N.Y. Adjournment better than confrontation.

P.M. And hope we shall take public initiative on peace-keeping as soon as committee established.

f) S. Rhodesia.

P.M. Cab.‟s good wishes to L. Ch. &amp; C. Secy on their mission.

3. A policy for the Arts. C(65) 22.

[Enter M.P.B.W. and Parly Secy M.P.B.W.

P.M. Genesis of W.P. Gratitude to all who have contributed.

Para. 77 – time ripe for the change.

Parly Sec. P.M.‟s meeting yesterday with Ch. of Arts Council etc. Insert new

M.P.B.W. formula (after second sentence of para. 78) containing assurance of no political direction of Council‟s policy.

Para. 80, indicates our main proposals. But means to implement them? C. Garden – a reduction! Gen. grant to A.C. for ‟65-‟66 – also less than in last 3 years (in terms of increase).

P.M. But add last sentence of para. 80.

Parly Sec. Also starting a bldg. grant – at £¼m! – to encourage local bldg. for arts.

M.P.B.W. That brings total to £665,000 – i.e. only slightly larger than in last 3 yrs. Even so, must be free to add during year – e.g. for Goodman cttee. on orchestras (£200,000 absolute minimum). And other cases. Remember Cripps &amp; Bevan period – even more difficult ec. circs. than now: but we helped the arts then &amp; must do so now. A little here more than repays itself. Can I have that little?

M.P.B.W. Popular appeal of these proposals enormous. Therefore don‟t rest this imposing superstructure on derisory financial provision.

Ch. Exch. I personally drafted para. 80 in consultn with My of P.B.W.

Arts C. grant (exel. Cov. G) is 30% up: and total Vote provision also up.

No other Dept. has got a para. 80 equivalent!

Merits of transfer to My of E &amp; S, with guarantee of indepce, arguable. But let it go.

P.M. Ests. already approved and can‟t be altered. But virtual promise of a Suppy Est. v. valuable: and Goodman Cttee. shd. now accelerate its

report - ? for announcement in Budget speech.

Emphasise regional aspects of W.P. – (while also emphasising provision for central insts in London) – and bldg. proposals.

S/S. S. Must make sure right sort of people on A. Council to implement our policy.

Transfer of functions to separate Deptl Ministers complicates things for Scotland. Special arrangements required.

S/S. W. C.G. a closed shop. You can‟t get a ticket!

P. Secy This is being examined.

M.P.B.W.

M.P. Para. 38: shd. be extended to county councils.

P. Secy I agree.

M.P.B.W.

Col. Sec. Make list of festivals in para. 42 complete.

P.M. Approve. Publicn with V/A on Monday has some advantages – but also risks blanketing. Settle for Monday.

[Exeunt M.P.B.W: Parly Sec. M.P.B.W.

4. Vote on Account 1965-66. C(65) 24. [Enter Ch. Secy Tsy.

Ch. Exch. Statement desirable to offset impact on intl opinion.

P.M. Agree.

Para. 7 - ? safeguard o‟sea aid.

M.O.D. I agree.

M. Techy It will commit us to not increasing expre. unless we cut elsewhere. Unwise – since, if defence savings not achieved, we are helpless.

M.H.L.G. And absence of any refce. to control of private sector v. misleading.

On this basis Statement is merely repetn of recent “warning” by Gov. of B/E. Control of public sector expre. is not most important element in economic plan.

P.M. I shall deal with this point in my political speech on Saturday.

But insert something in draft.

First Secy Refce. to 23% unwise – since ties our hands.

Ch. Duchy. I agree: omit whole para.

S/S E.S. I also agree. And get increases right – à la Economist – in terms of expre. as distinct from estimates.

F.S. F. S/S. shd. refer to this statement at E.F.T.A. Council: and advance briefing for overseas posts shd. be prepared.

L.P. Add some indicn that long-term defence expre. is to come down – as will be explained in Defence W.P.

Ch. Exch. I accept M.H.L.G.‟s point. But unless we get right ec. growth, we can‟t achieve 23% - without intolerable taxn. So arguable that I begin to doubt whether statement advisable at all.

P.M. Ch. Exch. &amp; I will reconsider: bring forward redraft on Monday.

M.T. Blame our predecessors‟ commitments rather than their policies.
