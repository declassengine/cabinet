C.C. (65) 63 23 November 1965 11 a.m.

1. London Transport Fares. C.(65) 153.

F. S/S. As in memm. Increase incompatible with prices policy, already under strain on bread, coal etc. Increase shd. be deferred until new traffic plan for London available.

M.T. No easy way of traffic control – either by admve discretion or charge. Charge for entry into central area in peak hours may be ultimate remedy.

P.M. ?All business owned and car hire cars to be taxed to raise sum equivalent to deficit (£8m.).

M.T. Hypothecated revenue doubtful.

M. Tech. I support minority view. Mustn‟t make cars in London impossible, in view of importance of home market for car industry. And if basic 4d fare remains, increase is 30% - v. damaging to incomes policy.

Ch. Duchy. Earlier suspension of fares increase was not long enough to enable transport policy to be worked out. Leave that to Transport Cttee: and defer fares increase for a further 6 months.

P.M. At least allow few more weeks to consider means of easing congestion and/or increasing revenue by e.g. taxing business cars etc. for access to central London.

Ch. Exch. Unrealistic – merely evades basic issue. None of proposals under considn will make London transport viable before 1970. Must therefore have combined policy of raising fares &amp; curbing private motorist. Can‟t defer fares increase indefinitely.

P.M. But allow for social costs in relation to profit and loss of one individual undertaking. If fares increased each time, deficit will be even greater by 1970. Deficit is inherent in London transport: and what we must try to do is to alleviate it by taxing those who are responsible for it.

P.B.T. Don‟t dissent: but some increase in fares unavoidable if natd industries not to be discredited and demoralised.

M.T. If defer decision beyond to-day, increase can‟t be operative on 1 Jan.

P.M. Even so, defer for a fortnight to let Transport Cttee assess prospects.

2. Prices &amp; Incomes Policy: Armed Forces‟ Pay. C.(65) 158.

P.M. Chs. of Staff have urged me to disallow refce. to P &amp; I Board on ground that two months delay wd. create uncertainty, &amp; damage morale &amp; recruiting. Not only bad faith – but even breach of contract. Even so, Cab. decision must stand: and T. of R. must be agreed.

S/S. D. Last phrase must stand in order to meet Ch. of S. point: and it was conceded in P.M.‟s summing up at last Tuesday‟s Cab.

F. S/S. But Govt. has got discretion on report from any review body. Therefore can‟t prejudge by refce. to “commitment”.

Ch. Exch. I agree. Refce. of Franks proposal makes no such refce.

Ch. Duchy. Suggested altve formula. [Exeunt L.P. &amp; P.B.T.

S/S. D. .. variant.

F. S/S. But Govt‟s evidence must at least be in one memm.

S/S. D. I must remain free to press Services‟ case.

P.M. Orally: but statement of case must be in one document. Otherwise Board becomes Cabinet adjudicating between two rival Ministers.

M. Lab. That will become clear during oral evidence.

P.M. Compromise formula at beginning of T. of R. Oral evidence shd. be factual – not special pleading. S/S. D. to draft written statement - &amp; this shd. be discussed interdepartmentally.

Statement in H/C. on Thursday – by F. S/S.

3. Earnings – Related Short-Term Benefits. C.(65) 157.

[Enter M.P.N.I: M.H.

Ch. Secy As in memm. But can‟t predict outcome of negotiations.

M.P.N.I. If benefits to be deducted, why not (graduated) contribns also abated.

Employers must take into a/c what they will save &amp; let employers share this. Contracting out shd. not extend to sickness &amp; unempt benefits: everybody shd. be contracted. [Exeunt F. S/S: F.S.

M.H.L.G. If implicn of Bill is to penalise public employees, it shd. be reconsidered.

H.S. I agree - qua police and firemen.

S/S. E.S. But must press on with redistributive principle – even at some cost to public service (incl. my teachers!).

Ch. Exch. And I can‟t afford another £6m. to compensate them! But can‟t public servants be excluded?

M.P.N.I. Only if all occupl pensioners excluded – which negatives whole purpose of scheme.

P.M. Defer till next Cab. Ch. Exch. to consider further before then.

[Exeunt M.H: M.P.N.I: M. Lab: S/S. D.

4. Speed Limit. C.(65) 156.

M.T. As in memm.

Col. Sec. 30 m.p.h. in bad conditions too high - &amp; unenforceable. Signals shd. merely indicate bad conditions.

70 m.p.h. is too low for motorways: too high for others. All roads shd. be categorised for speed.

P.M. 30 m.p.h. too high? Anyhow confine lorries to inside lane?

M.P. H.A. Cttee shd consider this. On 30 m.p.h. limit, no figure is enforceable: and Advisory Cttee &amp; police thought reduction of speed on warning signals more important than restriction of absolute speed.

P.M. Even so, add warning about absolute speed: and about lorry lanes.
