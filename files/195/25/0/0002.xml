C.C. (65) 8 8 February 1965. 11 a.m.

1. Defence Economies: Aircraft (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip: M. Avn

P.M. Cancellations provoked H.S. counter proposal of H.S. „681 body with Comet wing. No refce. in V. of C. debate: but offered to consider if H.S. cd. produce, in 3 days, firm proposals for price &amp; time scale. They have done this – price being lower than H.S. 681 tho‟ higher than C.130.

M. Avn Price offer embarrassing since too low to reject out of hand but too high to accept easily in relation to C.130.

On merits, performance roughly equal, with balance in favour of 802, on speed etc. Cost advantage of £25-30 m. on initial outlay (plus more on maintenance &amp; opn of about £50m. over 10 years) for C.130: i.e. 35%. Rather less than 2 year delivery advantage in favour of C.130.

On balance reject 802 – even tho‟ £75m. of $ wd. be saved. (But credit arrangements for Phantoms might be worsened.)

802, with P1129 &amp; work on Comet, wd. bring H.S. labour force to new peak in 3 years. Wd. eliminate Govt-caused redundancies. Wd. keep some design teams but not all.

Result wd. be to concentrate airframe future with H.S. (and engines with R-R.). Wd. therefore anticipate Plowden report.

S/S. D. Figures produced in 10 days v. unreliable. But, even if accept them, delivery date is at least 2 years later than C.130.

Adds £50m. to defence budget over next 5 years, since this wd. not be eligible for U.S. loan. This wd. be extra to addl cost overall. Might also lose favourable terms for Phantom.

No case for proposal: v. discreditable to appear to go back on decision already announced.

Ch. Exch. I agree – despite politics involved. Cost difference of £34m. can‟t be ignored. And hybrid plane won‟t do much for Br. industry.

And collapse of U.S. credit arrangements, leaving us to pay for Phantoms now, wd. be v. unwelcome.

And shd. we have to offset loss of Phantom prodn in U.K.?

S/S. D. Arrangement is for Spry engines in Phantoms wherever made: and 50% of Ph. assembly (by value) in U.K. subject to tolerance limit of 15%. This might be jeopardised if we go back on C.130.

P.B.T. But, if so:- a) larger $ expre. to save budget: not an economic propn.

b) C.130 is an old aircraft.

S/S. D. No: our version will be only 2 years old: and Air Staff content with it as a transport aircraft.

P.B.T. But H.S. 802, being newer, wd. be bound to be more reliable.

c) we propose to waste resources in Belfast, since they won‟t be re-employed easily.

d) we are becoming more dependent on U.S. – as is shown if they will revise rest of package if we go back on C.130. That makes motive clear.

M.H.L.G. Rejection of H.S. proposal could not be justified publicly by reasons given here- i.e. inadequacy of U.K. aircraft.

Cab. not sufficiently informed about package deal: if reasoning so clear, v. foolish to encourage H.S. to put forward 802 at all.

M. Tech. Original justification was 3 for price of 1. Now margin is only 35-40%; and politically concern is country-wide. How then can one defend decision not on grounds of cost but on grounds of comparative unreliability. And risk of loss of rest of package deal makes U.S. motive – i.e. complete dependence – quite clear.

[Enter M.O.D.

M.O.D. But we must streamline our aircraft industry for basic economic reasons; and we have already decided to risk political odium and dependence on U.S. Must stick to this, provided we make clear quickly the actual measures for redeployment etc.

L. Ch. I agree. New offer is not reliable in terms of cost and timing (as past experience with H.S. has shown). But must have better publicity for redeployment, training etc.

M.H.L.G. But avoid small saving here and then give way on TSR 2.

Ch. Exch. Can‟t ignore cost difference of 40% - and higher running costs. Total saving shd. be 55-60%.

And this is only first step in defence economies: commitments have still to be dealt with.

I agree with M.H.L.G. about TSR 2: this incident must finish it.

M. Avn H.S. 802 not significant for techl future of industry, (whereas TSR 2 &amp; Strike trainer are). Main considns are employment; and if we give way for these reasons we shall merely encourage more lobbying next time.

P.M. Conclusive args. are timing &amp; cost – i.e. defence arguments. But must be put carefully in public. Impression of dithering due to premature leaks of earlier discussions. Therefore keep this discussion secret; and in debate make clear that it is Tories who are responsible for sitn and for opposing change &amp; redept. Emphasise arrangements for training, severance pay etc.

First Secy Yes: but must know what vacancies there will be, &amp; where &amp; when. No real problem until TSR 2 decision taken.

P.M. But redept must be arranged on social, not balance-sheet, grounds: and Govt. must ultimately decide which factory is to be closed.

M. Tech. This makes decision to abandon TSR 2 certain. And then we shall have destroyed the Br. aircraft industry.

M. Avn 3000 (9000 by end of 65) are on 681 &amp; 1154. 1900 re-employed by ‟65; therefore 7000 “redundant” (by anticipation) by end of ‟65. But this includes 6000 not directly attributable to this.

M.H.L.G. But H.S. will close an 8000 factory at Coventry.

2. Gibraltar. C(65) 18. [Enter Parly. Sec. C.O.

F.S. Spain wants to acquire Gib. Current pressure derives from our decision to increase self-govt. – i.e. relation with Treaty of Utrecht; U.N. consensus; cancellation of SPANEX.

None of counter measures (in Annex) realistic: trade war might ultimately damage Spain more than us but wd. damage us a lot meantime. Hence my conclusion – hold on to Gib. and supply it as best we can. Also try to mobilise Press campaign against restricns.

Latest measure to require fresh fruit to be diverted to Spanish port on route to Gib. (where delayed until fruit perishes) ought to be countered by naval means.

Must say something in H/C. before adjournment debate on Thursday.

P.M. ? Strengthen garrison: and show flag navally.

S/S. D. Latter yes: former more doubtful.

P.M. Rub home lesson of “frigates for Spain”.

Avoid economic war with Spain: and treat as a Gib. matter – aid by whatever devt means we can.

Parly Sec. Gib.‟s growing prosperity (tourism etc.) makes it more vulnerable; and it

C.O. will suffer if dispute goes on. Must therefore back up Gib. – e.g. by not increasing Gib. aviation fare if Malaga fare is reduced; by not allowing ships to bunker in Sp. ports instead of at Gib. (because of R.N.‟s high charges); and by releasing surplus R.N. land for housing etc.

If Sp. fear Gib. will go same way as Malta, can we reassure them? Gib. does not want any more self-govt.

Should a Minister visit Gib?

L.P. May be beginnings of large political row in U.K.

Trouble seems to be on border: can we deal with it there – e.g. by retaliatory measures?

P.M. Little scope, since traffic is one way. Either ask Chief Minister to come to U.K. for talks or send a Minister out. And consider resisting diversion of fruit ships: Spain won‟t go to war about this.

C.S. We must support Gib: send a Minister out.

S/S. W. I agree: otherwise a Parly row.

M. Tech. Gib. does not want indepce. Make this clear. And avoid type of Minl visit wh. might be so interpreted – or as prelude to attack on Spain.

Ch. Exch. I agree. And consider whether we need Gib. at all – at least for defence.

Ch. Duchy. I too agree: avoid another Suez – and rely on discussions in U.N. etc.

We dealt with a blockade in Berlin: and can do same here. Don‟t be misguided by memories of our duties in an imperial past. Better to endure Sp. provocation for a bit.

P.M. We have made it clear we will go to Cttee of 24 – but not under duress or on basis of surrender of Gib.

M. Avn On air fares, v. complex issues. Avoid hasty action.

P.M. Yes – but use admve delays wherever possible? No: better to try to help Gib.

M.H.L.G. But Malaga case?

M. Avn V. difficult, since a bargain wh. is in B.E.A.‟s interest. Don‟t renegotiate Sp. rights, wh. are v. favourable to us. And Malaga involves not only fares but also services: can‟t risk diverting these.

P.M. Even so, proceed slowly with Malaga Agt: and warn tourist agencies quickly.

F.S. Keep quiet about possy of ultimate not use of Gib: can‟t negotiate on surrender of sovty. Keep temperature down. But try to ensure supplies of fresh fruit.

P.M. S/S. D. to consider. And speed up release of Admy land for prefab houses for dispossessed families. Send Admy Minister out for this and to boost morale. Discuss at D.O.P. use of naval ships to ensure food supplies.

On second thoughts Parly Sec. M.O.D. better than Admy Minister.

CLOSED UNDER THE

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION

ACT 2000

Go slow on Sp. request for fishing rights in mind.

3. Viet-Nam (oral).

P.M. P.M.Q. to-day. Must restate we are ready to offer, as co-chairman, to reconvene confce if necy. Note N.V.N. now admit they are at war.

4. Economic Situation (oral).

Ch. Exch. $3 b. credits now renegotiated for a further 3 months: announce later this week. A useful breathing space.
