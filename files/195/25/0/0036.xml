C.C.(65) 44 3 August 1965 10.30 a.m.

1. Parliament (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip.

L.P. Business for first week after Recess.

2. The National Plan. C(65) 116. [Enter M.H.: M.Avn: M.P.B.W.

F. S/S. As in memm. Timetable of publicn – geared to 16 Sept., if still right then to publish. Amdts. still to come in light of latest economic measures. But don‟t be deterred from publishing plan for growth because of immediate embarrassments which may retard initial stages of growth. Discuss

Chapter 1.

S/S. D. Defence redns imply cuts in commitments wh. are not yet agreed.

F.S. Agree: can‟t prejudge this.

F. S/S. But we are committed in principle to £2000m. by 1969/70.

S/S. D. But not to means by which it will be achieved – i.e. to extent of saving in foreign exchange.

F. S/S. Accept omission of quantitative refce: say de.

Ch. Exch. Para. 41: ? premature. Reconsider.

Para. 76: too flat footed. Reconsider.

P.B.T. 5½% volume increase in exports v. optimistic: and based only on industry‟s own expectations. Accept: but realise optimistic, even as a target.

F. S/S. Point taken in para. 13.

Ch. Exch. Yes: but raises issue of credibility of Plan in light of our intl obligns. B/P. forecasts optimistic, given need to repay I.M.F. etc. If expectations disappointed, public expre. may require increases in taxn.

F. S/S. Maybe: but can‟t stimulate growth by pessimism.

P.M. Plan must include some element of target – not mere extrapolation of present sitn.

M. Techy My Dept‟s role must be made more clear.

And no indication of a rolling Plan.

F. S/S. Yes: see para. 61.

M.O.D. Must publish Plan for morale of Party. And must show clearly an industrial, not a financial, problem – wh. won‟t be solved in five years. Must lengthen perspective: and emphasise role of social policy in liberating energies of the people. This is not a Plan comparable with e.g. French plan.

S/S. E.S. Yes: it is at least as sophisticated. And right to be optimistic and to include target element.

Don‟t be too chary about taxes: our levels are still too low by comparison with other developed countries.

Educl chapter must be rewritten since now we shan‟t reach Robbins target.

M.P. Any lag in power programme serious: and any lag in programme as a whole will offset power programme as regards redundancy, retraining etc.

M.A.F.F. My plan is more sophisticated than French plan. Right to have a Plan and to be optimistic.

Ch. Duchy. Para. 67 by et seq rather confusing in relation to Chap. 15. Division between pub. expre. and pers. consumpn shd. be sharpened – for political reasons. Get this right in popular version: public squalor/private affluence.

F. S/S. Don‟t write Plan down by comparison with other countries.

Don‟t turn Plan into a Party manifesto.

Can‟t recast Plan as a whole: but will consider comments on individual Deptl chapters, e.g. on educn, or energy.

New coal target in para. 64 v. significant: won‟t be more than 170 m. tons by 1970, and, tho‟ we can shade to 170-180, must be realistic.

Accept need to emphasise low rate of increase in pers. consumpn: but don‟t be too depressing about it.

S/S. W. If run down of mining labour is to be acceptable, we must be seen to be acting now.

P.M. Special Fund proposal shd. be at least simultaneous with Plan.

Strengthen refce. to incomes policy, on lines of my speech last night.

On revision of Plan, sectional changes can be published: but not new version of whole Plan?

F. S/S. But must avoid appearing to adhere to targets wh. are out of date, or to sidestep them.

M.O.D. Should deal more drastically with defence. And refces. to aid must be adapted to Cabinet‟s final decision: see para. 4 on p. 15.1.

M.H.L.G. Transfer detail of housing in Ch. 18 to housing chapter. Irrelevant to analysis of pub. expre. on p. 18.4.

F. S/S. Wd. make table irrational.

M.H.L.G. Then why omit aid from this table?

F. S/S. I will consider.

P.M. Agree publicn in mid-Sept. Cab. shd. delegate authy to small group to settle final text. [Exit L.P.

[Enter M.P.N.I.

3. Computer Industry. C(65) 115 and 117.

M. Techy As in memm. Some protection now essential: price factor not most important – but Govt. purchasing, tho‟ proportionately not v. large, vital. B.O.A.C. &amp; B.E.A. have bought computers wh. are not even compatible!

Tariffs not a practicable instrument. Therefore adopt my proposals. They won‟t diminish competitive incentive: our computer advisory unit can deal with that.

Must be in earnest here: and M.P.N.I. is a test case in view of others to follow the first in this case.

P.M. Create a co-ordinating purchasing committee in whole of public sector.

[Exit M.P.N.I.: M.T.

[Enter Parly. Sec. M.P.N.I.

S/S. E.S. Flowers report will produce required material qua univs. &amp; research estabts.

M. Avn B.O.A.C. v. sensitive to pressures wh. will reduce their competve power.

[Exit M.P.B.W.

P.M. Even so, create the cttee. under senior official of M. Techy.

Can‟t accept no price differentl. At present 24% - 14% tariff &amp; 10% surcharge.

P.B.T. Can‟t increase tariff: and must have some limit on differenl.

P.M. Follow “Buy America” Act principle.

Ch. Exch. But can we ever hope to compete on large models, (for which market is small) unless we subsidise heavily?

P.M. Even so, must avoid U.S. monopoly.

S/S. D. But savings from computers relatively small: and choice may be between buying U.S. computer or not buying one at all.

M. Techy But, if we subsidise, we throw it away if we don‟t then buy British.

S/S. E.S. Accept protectionist policy: but 12 months too long.

F.S. Right in this case: but not of general applicn. And consult E.F.T.A. in advance if any public statement. [Exit Ch. Exch.

F. S/S. Protection will only feather-bed the industry. But I won‟t press the point. Even so protection must be limited – to specific figure: and 12 months too long.

P.M. Accept 25% &amp; 12 months: committee to consider exceptions in case of artificial prices by competitors or cases of opl urgency – i.e. cases for exceeding 25% or going below 12 months. Accept new defn of British in 6(ii). Extra cost to be charged to M. Techy.

ICT-EE. Link disappointing: may have to consider participating in their equity structures on minority basis. [Exeunt M.H.L.G: M.H.

M. Techy They wd. prefer this to amalgamation. I will pursue this.

P.M. On M.P.N.I. case, ? take UNIVAC for Reading &amp; defer decision on others until m.c.f. has proved itself - &amp; then move to L.E.O.

M. Techy It wd. lose co-ordinated compatibility. [Exit M.O.D.

P.M. But jobs are different.

Parly Sec. Only 4 UNIVACS but 7 L.E.O.‟s wd. be needed for national coverage of

M.P.N.I. short term benefits. And UNIVAC more reliable &amp; installed 6 months earlier: and delay already costly.

P.M. See Annex I: almost as expensive as manual system. Defer for 6 months (as other pub. expre!); re-examine foreign exch. cost and see if L.E.O. can be accelerated. E.D.C. to consider and report in autumn.

[Exit M. Avn: Parly Sec. M.P.N.I.

4. Coal Industry. C(65) 110.

M.P. As in memm. Proposal is complementary to programme of closures and efforts to put industry on a more economic basis.

F. S/S. Which is worse – increase in Coal Board‟s deficit or impact of price increase on p. &amp; i. policy? Latter: therefore carry the deficit.

M.P. Price increase will vary from area to area.

P.M. But no price control!

S/S. W. Implicit that in some areas no increase: heavy increase in others – and in S. Wales will kill the industry.

P.M. And regional differentl will increase industrial costs in e.g. Durham &amp; N‟land, while industries drawing from Midland coalfields will benefit.

E.D.C. shd. examine this new feature: report to Cab. on Thursday.
