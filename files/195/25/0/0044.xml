C.C. (65) 52 21 October 1965. 10 a.m.

1. Oversea Affairs (oral). [Enter Ch. Whip: M/S. F.O: A. Gen.

(a) Rhodesia.

P.M. Smith‟s message yesterday. Means:- a) decision taken (whether immediate or deferred) but onus on us. b) withdrawal from brink.

Whichever view right must keep negotns going, particularly in light of doubtful extent of Oppn support and risk of Party split on grounds of race and colour. I shd. therefore propose to visit S‟bury on condition I see everybody I want to see – i.e. broaden from bilateral negotn with Rh. Govt. to comprehensive discussn, wh. might lead on to a constl confce. or be some sort of substitute for it.

Reply shd. also nail misrepresentations in S.‟s letter.

He may refuse proposal – in order to unify white Rh. opinion.

C.S. H.Cr. believes u.d.i. inevitable &amp; therefore P.M. shd. go. But v. hard for S. to accept.

L. Ch. Equally hard to refuse.

M.O.D. May refuse access to Afr. Nats. etc.

S/S. D. Difficult since S. quotes them in relation to ‟61 Constn.

P.M. S‟s presentation of Treaty disingenuous: not appropriate for other than defence facilities and not thought out in terms of sanctions etc. S. did not press it: and broke off discussions after admitting a poss. soln for only one of 5 principles. Even so, C. Secy offered at airport to discuss it further.

M.H.L.G. Premature to risk P.M. alone at this stage – particularly if altercn about condition on access to Africans.

S/S. D. Better to offer discussions – with P.M. in last resort.

M.O.D. And don‟t lean over too far to conciliate S: watch Afr. reaction.

Compromise with S. cd. have worse results than u.d.i.

P.M. But this wd. be a way of making contact with Afrs. &amp; not talking only to S. And on timing this may be last chance to play the trump card.

M.H.L.G. Why not leave it to C.S. at this stage? P.M.‟s contacts with Afrs. cd be misrepresented.

P.M. Can‟t be caught with trump unplayed when game ends. And I am going not to negotiate in detail but to try to establish political climate in which negotns might be renewed – perhaps by continuing political presence.

But I must insist on seeing anybody I want to see.

C.S. I wd. support M.H.L.G. if H.Cr. did not advise u.d.i. imminent.

Ch. Exch. I agree: may be last chance to play the trump.

M.H.L.G. ?Associate D-Home: i.e. bipartisan delegation.

P.M. Attractive: but puts Govt. into commission and Oppn‟s motives wd. not be on all fours with ours.

Remembering consequences of u.d.i. – for U.K. industry – must do all we can to avert it. And in one sense I shd. be a one-man Cw. Mission; and wd. keep Accra quiet!

M.H.L.G. Still advantages in bipartisan approach?

L. Ch. No: note ambivalence of Oppn attitude on who first suggested Treaty.

M.O.D. And they might try to deal separately with S. in Rhodesia.

P.M. I will try to deal with Oppn before I go, - e.g. by extracting written comment on McLeod‟s doubt on illegality of u.d.i. wh. contradicts D-H.‟s attitude on Sept. ‟64.

But ? some case for taking e.g. Salisbury.

M.H.L.G. A bipartisan delegn shd. go first: keep P.M. for later.

S/S. D. No Oppn paticipn at any stage: they wd. divide counsel and claim credit for themselves while putting blame on Govt. Awkward if u.d.i. comes and sanctions are needed.

P.M. Valuable discussn: go ahead.

2. Road Safety. C.(65) 136. [Enter Ld. Advocate.

Ch. Duchy. As in memm. [Enter F. S/S.

M.T. I agree.

P.M. What about drunken pedestrians who cause motor accidents?

M. Techy Random checks give police too much power. And what is “being in charge of vehicle”? Random checks on drunk man sleeping in car, with no defence by trial by jury, v. arguable.

M.T. Random tests already in operation, for lorries and cars. And drunk man asleep in a car is a separate issue, already covered by law.

Any improvement in social habits requires test as proposed, on basis of random checks of amount of alcohol in blood.

H.S. I support M.T. Police favour random tests, since selective tests wd. be more damaging to relations with public.

A.G. Nevertheless, a revolutionary change in law, since decision depends on amount of alcohol in blood not on behaviour of driver. Has relation between amount of alcohol and incapacity to drive been established? If so, I support random tests. But refce. to magistrates will be incentive to police to bring cases by this means. But, if issue is to be almost entirely one of fact, risk of perverse verdicts by juries (deriving from sympathy with motorist) will be

much reduced. Therefore don‟t increase oppn to measures by depriving motorists of right of trial by jury.

S/S. E.S. I agree. And I am uneasy about power for police in random checks.

Ch. Whip Random checks will anger public. Better to start with selective tests and to introduce random checks by Order after 3 years.

M.O.D. No: public opinion is expecting something like Swedish principle. Therefore go for random tests. Level in question is certified by B.M.A. as leaving no real doubt – even if driver shows no signs.

L. Ch. I agree – fair &amp; impartial. And only means of changing social habits. On juries, their record is so bad that shd. try to leave to magistrates as in Scotland.

M.H.L.G. I endorse random tests: but keep trial by jury. And start with selective tests – random wd. be too much for police discretion on New Year‟s Day.

S/S. D. Selective even heavier burden for police discretion. Therefore favour random. But retain jury.

P.B.T. Level shd. be high: penalty shd. be no more than fine if no other evidence of incapacity: and retain jury.

M.A.F.F. I agree with L.P. in favouring selective tests: and keep jury.

M.P. All tests are selective in some sense. Therefore random.

S/S. W. Agree: selective wd. be regarded as class biased.

F. S/S. Random better – as changing social habits. But keep jury.

May be electorally damaging: even so go ahead.

P.M. Balance of view – keep jury, since issue will be matter of objective fact. On tests - ? start with selective but take power to introduce random later.

F. S/S. No: compromise worst of all worlds.

Ch. Duchy. Class-discrimn: and presumption that driver has been drinking.

V. invidious and objectionable.

M.H.L.G. But, if driver (tho‟ drunk) does not trip on b-analysis, he can drive on by simply paying fine.

Ch. Exch. But that is not the point: small group will do this but we are trying to change social habits over a wide front.

P.M. Majority view favours random test. Swedish system imposes fine as proportion of income. HAC shd. examine this in principle – tho‟ not necessarily in this context. But disqualifn is best penalty.

Important not to treat as a Party matter: give Parlt more say, by letting Select Cttee prepare a Bill. Perhaps not here, since we are committed to introduce

Bill before Xmas. But ? 2R Cttee: and ? free vote – at least on this proposal, if part of larger Bill. Decide this at Leg. Cttee stage.

3. Steel Nationalisation (oral).

P.M. Arguably unwise to put Govt.‟s survival at risk on this Bill.

But this concedes that 2 members of Party can dictate – a bad precedent. And, if strong feeling in a Party repressed on one issue, it erupts on another – i.e. major revolt on immigration. Govt. cannot afford to appear to be pushed around on any major issue.

If not in Q. Speech, must have some convincing excuse. ? Priorities – something in this. But won‟t conceal real reason. Opinion polls movement will strengthen conviction that we shd. force issue now.

? Include some refce. in Speech: but do nothing. Dangerous.

L.P. General view at Chequers meeting against going ahead. If so, any refce. in Q. Speech cd. only be inconclusive and unsatisfy. Therefore best to say nothing in Speech but to reveal in Debate on Address.

Ch. Exch. If no mention in Speech, some issues (compensn) will have to be dealt with.

P.M. Suggn that docks shd. replace steel as priority has been explored. Shows Devlin reforms might be at risk by declared natn of docks – tho‟ this may be possible later.

M. Techy Accept this on docks. Therefore go ahead with natn of steel – rather than appear to be pushed around by minority. May be defeated: but that may happen anyhow.

M.H.L.G. Postponement can be justified on grounds of higher priority of many other measures.

M.O.D. But if an urgent priority last year, why not now? Chequers argument no longer valid: and it wd. appear surrender to two rebels.

To exclude steel from Plan (as we have) and from Q. Speech poses question not “when” but “whether”; and will strain Party loyalty too far, on top of V-Nam, immigration etc.

M.P. Examn had shown that, longer postponed, more difficult to maintain posn in Bill on e.g. precautions against dissipn of assets – wh. depend, anyhow, on goodwill not on sanctions. And legn on steel may be needed anyhow since R.P. Court have ruled against Board‟s max. prices. But must protect price levels somehow since, given prospect of weak selling period, assets may not be worth nationalising.

S/S. W. Party unity the dominant factor. Supporters of natn wd. be effective in protesting: and this cd. split the Party. Therefore shd. be included.

Ch. Exch. A qun of Party management: and proposals in W.P. justified on merits. Priority last year justified on grounds of “get it over”: this is no longer true, nor will industry be ruined if we postpone now. Strength of Govt. not necy proved by insisting on something wh. is not urgent and is debatable, however

strongly we may believe in it. It is for Govt. to decide when to include a measure in Parly programme – and when to have new Election.

But, on other hand, real problem of Party management, aggravated by immigration. Therefore I favour (genuine) deferment, provided we can handle Party.

P.M. ? Include and, if defeated on 2R, accept will of the House. But unprecedented to be defeated on major issue and not resign.

S/S. D. Everybody assumes, after Conference, won‟t be included. And public opinion polls show this not taken as weakness: change of front now wd. be, and damaging to Party morale to have to flog through this Bill.

On immigration, those threatening to abstain won‟t be affected by steel.
