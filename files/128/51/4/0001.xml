ParliamentaryAffairsPenaltiesfor MurderBillExport of animals(Control)BillCONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet were informed that there were tactical difficultiesin connection with a Private Member&apos;s Bill Mr. Edward Taylor&apos;sPenalties for Murder Bill which was being considered on SecondReading on 26 January. The Bill&apos;s principal aim was to give effectto a recommendation of the Emslie Committee on the Penalties forHomicide in Scotland (Cmnd. 5137) by requiring that a judge pro-nouncing a life sentence of imprisonment for murder should berequired, save in exceptional circumstances, to state the minimum period which should in his view elapse before the Home Secretaryordered the release of the individual concerned on licence. The bill would apply to the whole of Great Britain. The Report of theEmslie Committee, however, was concerned only with the law inScotland; and the Criminal Law Revision Committee, in theirrecently published interim report on The Penalty for Murder(Cmnd. 5184), had strongly opposed the Emslie Committee&apos;recommendation so far as England and Wales were concerned.Moreover, the view of the Criminal Law Revision Committee was supported by the Lord Chief Justice and all The Queen&apos;s BenchJudges. The Home and Social Affairs Committee had concluded that the Bill should be prevented from reaching the Statute Bookbut that it might be preferable that nothing should be said in thecourse of debate suggesting that the Government were rejecting theReport of the Emslie Committee, since this could cause embarrass-ment to Scottish Ministers.In discussion it was suggested that a free vote would be tacticallyadvisable. This would be likely to result in the BhTs defeat in any event. But it was desirable that the greatest possible number ofMinisters should be present in order to vote against it and that theGovernment spokesman in the debate should advise its rejection. in presenting the case against it, he should argue that further considera-tion of the important issues raised by the two reports was necessary before a conclusion could be reached, although without implying that the Government were necessarily rejecting the recommendationsof the Emslie Committee.The Cabinet-(1) Decided that there should be a free vote at the end of theSecond Reading Debate on the Penalties for Murder bill and that, in presenting the case against the Bill, theGovernment spokesman should avoid implying that theGovernment were necessarily rejecting the recommenda-tions made by the Emslie Committee.The Cabinet were informed that difficulties could also bf$expected in connection with another Private Member&apos;s Bill Sir Ronald RusselFs Export of Animals (Control) Bill.  The BilTsmain provisions were contrary to Rules of the European economic community (e.c.); and it was therefore undesirable that it shouldreceive a Second Reading. But there was strong support for the Bill,both from groups concerned with animal welfare and from thoseopposed to this country&apos;s participation in the e.c.; and, although
InterimReviewby theBoundaryCommissionfor EnglandPreviousReference:CM (72) 52ndConclusions,Minute 1farming interests were on the whole opposed to the Bill, it mightbe difficult to find a Member who would be prepared to object to it.Moreover, the Government would incur much unpopularity if they appeared to be responsible for the Bih&quot;s being blocked.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thaturgent consideration should be given to the launching of an initiativeby our representatives on the e.c. Commission to improve the content or the enforcement of the e.c. Rules governing the transport and slaughter of animals. By this means the broad objectives of theBill might be met without infringement of this country&apos;s obligations to the e.c.. An early announcement of the Governments intentionswould be desirable. Meanwhile, arrangements should be made forthe Bill to be blocked, perhaps by an objection from a Governmentsupporter representing a constituency with a strong farming interest.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up their discussion.(3) Invited the Chief Whip to arrange for the Bill to be blocked.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, in association with the other Ministers principally concerned,to consider the scope for our representatives on the EECCommission to take an initiative on the lines indicatedin the Prime Ministers summing up and for an earlypolicy announcement accordingly and to report their conclusions to the Prime Minister.The Cabinet were informed that five draft Orders would shortly be laid before Parliament giving effect to a report made by the boundary Commission for England, following an interim review which they had conducted in respect of 17 constituencies wherechanges in local government boundaries had occurred since1 January, 1969. Four of the Orders would attract no controversy;but the fifth, affecting four constituencies, might give rise to opposition, since objections had been raised to some of the relevantrecommendations by local organisations of both main Parties.The Cabinet agreed that, in responding to any opposition inParliament, the Governments spokesman should indicate that theGovernment were merely giving effect, without amendment, to recommendations which had been made by an impartial body.EconomicAffairsTheProgrammeforControllingInflation:The SecondStagePreviousReference:CM (73) 2ndConclusionsCONFIDENTIAL2. The Prime Minister reported that the White Paper &quot;TheProgramme for Controlling Inflation: The Second Stage&quot;(Cmnd. 5205) had on the whole been well received. But there hadbeen misunderstanding about the nature of Stage 3. There was a widespread belief that it would be even more stringent than Stage 2,whereas, as the White Paper made clear, the Governments intention was that there should be a progressive move away from the presentstandstill towards conditions in which there could be an orderlyimprovement of the real earnings and standard of living of the com-munity as a whole. Ministers should take every opportunity of publicly correcting the misunderstanding which had arisen and of
ImmigrationPolicyPreviousReference:CM (72) 57thConclusions,Minute 1SECRET3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Home Department (CP (73) 6) on the immigration Rules, together with the draft of a statement which theSecretary of State proposed should be made to Parliament on25 January.Immigration The Home Secretary said that the Immigration Rules had nowRules been redrafted in two separate parts, one dealing with Common-wealth citizens and the other with European Economic Community(e.c.) and other non-Commonwealth nationals. There were nomodifications of any importance in the Rules for e.c. and non-Commonwealth nationals, apart from the fact that citizens of theRepublic of Ireland would be dealt with by these Rules, as theyaffected treatment after entry, and not by the Commonwealth Rules.More substantial changes had been made in the Rules for Common-wealth citizens, the most important being a provision that a commonwealth citizen who could establish that he had a grand-parent born in the United Kingdom would be able to obtain acertificate granting him entry clearance, which would enable him tocome to this country in order to find work or to settle. Thisarrangement fell short of the provision in the 1971 Immigration Actregarding those who had a parent born in this country, in that acertificate of entry would have to be obtained in advance and the individuals concerned would remain liable to deportation. Never-theless, it would confer a benefit on large numbers of Canadian,Australian and New Zealand citizens, even though in practice onlya relatively small number might wish to take advantage of it. Thepossibility that the Anglo-Indian community in India might seek to exploit it had been carefully examined. There might be a fewthousands of such individuals; but there had been little indication that they wished to come to the United Kingdom and they seemed unlikely to present a serious immigration threat. If, however, thereshould be undue pressure from this or any other quarter, the Immigra-tion Rules, unlike an Act, could be changed by a simple and speedyParliamentary process. Moreover, the grand-patriality provision hadthe further advantage that it could be used to enable husbands orfiances of women settled in this country to obtain admission if theycould satisfy its requirement. In so far as these concessions, both ofwhich were based on the birth of a grandparent in the UnitedKingdom, might attract the criticism that they deliberately favoured the Old Commonwealth it would be necessary to defend them onthe ground that they were based on recent family connection withthis country and not on a colour preference.It was also proposed to raise from three to five years themaximum period for which young people might remain here onworking holidays; and, although it was necessary to retain thepresenting Stage 3 in positive terms on the lines indicated in theWhite Paper.
provision that they should be admitted initially only for 12 months,the Rules would make it clear that the initial admission would normally be for this period and that only in exceptional cases would it be shorter. By far the largest number of young people spendingworking holidays in the United Kingdom came from the old commonwealth countries. If citizens of the New Commonwealthwere to show signs of taking advantage of the proposed provision in large numbers, it would have to be reconsidered. The Rules wouldalso make it clear that admission for visits would normally be for not less than six months.Informal consultation with a representative number of the government&apos;s supporters suggested that these amendments shouldattract sufficient support to meet the objections which had been advanced, in the interests of the Old Commonwealth, to the earlierversion of the Rules and should ensure Parliamentary approval of theRules as they would now stand.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the changes which the HomeSecretary proposed to make in the Immigration Rules.Work The Secretary of State for Employment said that he proposedPermits to arrange for a suitable Parliamentary Question about work permitsunder the Immigration Act 1971 to be tabled for answer on the dayon which the Home Secretary would be making his statement. Thiswould make clear the Governmenfs intention that permits should beissued only for work requiring a professional qualification, skill or experience and in cases where the employment of an oversea workerwas reasonable and necessary.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said that itwould be desirable to re-examine the proposal to increase from,500 to 5,500 the number of work permits which might be grantedto skilled and unskilled hotel and catering workers. Even thoughthe figure of 3,500 had been related only to unskilled workers andthe proposed increase would merely reflect the fact that it was hence-forward to comprise also skilled workers who had hitherto beeneligible for permits in the usual way, the change might be difficult tojustify since a number of hotel and catering workers came from Italy,whose citizens would now, under the rules for e.c. nationals, be free to enter the United Kingdom in order to work without permits.Moreover, the output of our own catering training schools wassteadily increasing and the need for foreign workers should be progressively reduced. The hotel trade should be pressed to improve the conditions of service which it provided and should no longer be permitted to suppose that it could operate on the basis that foreign workers who were prepared to accept poor conditions would beavailable.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
*The Prime Minister said that a confidential approach to thePresident of Kenya, Mr. Jomo Kenyatta, had suggested that theGovernment of Kenya were unlikely in the near future to follow the example of President Amin of Uganda by forcibly expellingUnited Kingdom passport holders (UKPH); and this impression hadbeen confirmed at a subsequent meeting between the Secretary ofState for Defence and President Kenyatta. Private discussions had also taken place with the Prime Minister of India, Mrs. Gandhi, andthe Indian Foreign Minister, Mr. Swaran Singh, since the attitudeof India would be of critical importance if any other countryfollowed President Amin&apos;s lead. Mrs. Gandhi and Mr. SwaranSingh had fully appreciatel the political pressures to which theGovernment of the United Kingdom were subject as regards the riskof any repetition of a sudden influx of UKPH. But, while theywould wish to be as helpful as possible in such an event, they had indicated that they could not state publicly that they would accept asecond major movement of UKPH to India with a view to theirremaining there until they could be admitted to the United Kingdomover a long period under a regulated quota system. They had accordingly advised us to avoid any public statement of policy whichmight increase pressures on other African Governments to expedite the expulsion of their Asian residents or might encourage the Asiansto move quickly for fear that we intended to introduce new and drasticrestrictions. They would also look with disfavour on any actionon our part which might provoke questions in the Indian Parliamentto which the Indian Government would be obliged to reply in away which would not be in our common interest.These discussions with the Governments of Kenya and India,the secrecy of which should be carefully safeguarded, made it clearthat, in deciding on the terms of a statement to Parliament, we must seek a balance between reassuring public opinion in this country andavoiding precipitating the critical situation which we were concerned to anticipate.In discussion it was agreed that the section of the proposedParliamentary statement which dealt with UKPH satisfied theseconflicting requirements as fully as the circumstances allowed, subjectto certain minor amendments to which the Home Secretary wouldgive further consideration.In further discussion it was suggested that more attention musthenceforward be given to the longer-term implications of the situationwhich the Cabinet had been considering. In certain areas of thecountry the percentage of immigrants in the population was now so high that there was a risk of serious social and political disaffec-tion. Several studies which should be useful in this connection were already in hand in the Department of the Environment. But it wasnot clear that there was sufficient co-ordination of Departmentalpolicies in this matter; and a special project approach to the problemsof some of these areas might be required, even if it entailed expendi-ture over and above existing Departmental programmes.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that more detailed thought must be given to this potentially serious question;* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
and it might be necessary to review the arrangements for theco-ordination of the relevant Departmental policies.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would give further con-sideration to the most appropriate means of dealing withthe social problems resulting from immigration.Cabinet Office,23 January, 1973.
