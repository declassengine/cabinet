The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons in the following week.Revaluation It might be necessary to announce in Parliament measures to for Rating      reduce the impact of rating revaluation. If so, the statement wouldPrevious       preferably be made in the early part of the week, if possible on reference:       Monday.CM (72) 56thConclusions,Minute 1The Report of the ad hoc Select Committee which had been considering the arrangements for the scrutiny of draft instruments of the European Communities was expected to be published on thenext day. Its recommendations were in the main satisfactory.previous reference:CM (73) 5thConclusions,Minute 1EuropeanCommunities:ParliamentaryScrutiny ofDraftInstrumentsCounter-Inflation bill previous reference:CM (73) 7thConclusions,Minute 1The Cabinet were reminded that during the Report Stage of the counter-Inflation Bill in the following week, the Government v/ould be seeking to reverse amendments which had been made in Com-mittee reducing the initial duration of certain provisions of the Billfrom three years to one year. Ministers should do all they could toemphasise that the misgivings which had prompted these amend-ments were misplaced. The longer period could be justified on thegrounds that it would show that the Government were determined to stand firm on their counter-inflationary policies and that moderatetrade unionists themselves would welcome it in so far as it would reduce the scope for recurrent militancy.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thedestruction by the Israeli Air Force of a Libyan Air Lines aircraft over Sinai, resulting in the death of about a hundred passengers andcrew had increased still further the tension in the area, which hadalready been exacerbated by the latest Israeli incursion into the lebanon.India/Pakistan The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he wasPrevious under pressure from both sides of the House of Commons to reference: condemn the Indian Government for continuing to detain Pakistanicm (72) 34th prisoners of war. This action probably constituted a breach of theConclusions, Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war. But itMmute3 was not in the interest of our relations with India to condemn theattitude of the Indian Government in public; and it would be important to deal with the matter circumspectly in Parliament.Oversea affairs middle East
AfricaPrevious;:Reference:CM (7.3) 5thConclusions,Minute 3The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, reporting brieflyon his recent visit to Liberia, Senegal and Nigeria, said that he had found President Senghor of Senegal an impressive personality. Thesituation in Nigeria, however, was not wholly encouraging. A veryefficient Civil Service was managing to preserve the stability of thecountry. But the officers who constituted the Federal military government had little political understanding; and the Head of theGovernment, General Gowon, showed an unfortunate tendency to persist in a point of view, once he had adopted it, even though bothfact and reason might point to a different conclusion. For example,he had made up his mind that the proposal that Nigeria should seekassociation with the European Economic Community on the basisof arrangements corresponding to the Yaounde Convention hadbeen prompted by French hostility to the Anglophone countries of africa; and it had proved impossible to shake this conviction. Hehad also continued to adopt an inflexible attitude on the Rhodesianproblem.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and CommOn-wealth Secretary.SECRETEuropean 3.   The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that theCommunity Council of Ministers (Agriculture) of the European Economic Com-Affairs munity (e.c.) at their meeting on 19-20 February had agreed on arrangements to deal with the problems resulting from the continuedfloating of sterling. These arrangements were broadly acceptable to the United Kingdom and would help to safeguard domesticconsumer prices. The Council had also decided to defer by one month the introduction of new agricultural prices for the 1973-74season, allegedly in view of the recent parity changes but also inorder not to anticipate the situation which might develop after the impending French election.He had recently met the special representative in Europe of thePresident of the United States, Mr. Peter Peterson, who had beenvisiting Community capitals in order to discuss the prospects both forthe forthcoming trade negotiations and for international monetaryreform. Mr. Peterson&apos;s comments about the persisting differencewhich he detected between the e.c. and the United States on thesematters had been discouraging.In discussion it was suggested that it was not correct for theUnited States Government to imply that the e.c. countries were deliberately delaying international monetary reform. Indeed, it wasonly in the last few months that the United States authorities them-selves had taken a constructive interest in the matter.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that members of the Government should take any opportunity which arose to foster a more co-operative relationship between the United
States and the e.c. in the context of the trade and monetarynegotiations. It would be particularly important to make it clearthat the e.c. was as anxious as the United States to achieve a comprehensive reform of the international monetary system.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.northern ireland previous reference:CM (73) 7thConclusions,Minute 3SECRET4. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said that thesecurity forces had continued to enjoy considerable success in arrest-ing both Protestant extremists and members of the Irish republican army. A difficult situation was likely to develop, however, as aresult of the fact that a Protestant who had been sentenced to deathfor the murder of a policeman had recently lodged an appeal. Thelaw still provided for capital punishment in Northern Ireland, eventhough no execution had taken place since 1961; and he would now have to decide whether to commute the death sentence in the present case. Moreover, the murder had been committed with a licensedfirearm. This was the first occasion during the present emergencywhen it had been proved that a weapon of this kind had been used to commit a murder; and it would therefore be necessary to review theexisting policy in relation to the possession of licensed weaponswith a view to imposing more stringent controls. It would also benecessary to reconsider the arrangements under which registeredarms dealers were allowed to sell pistols and rifles. Although thenumber of dealers had been greatly reduced in the past nine months,275 of them were still in business; and 40 pistols, together with a large quantity of ammunition, had recently been stolen from a shop owned by one of them. It might prove necessary to withdraw entirely the permission to sell rifles and pistols commercially.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for northern Ireland.IndustrialAffairsCounter-Inflation PolicyPreviousReference:CM (73) 8thConclusions,Minute 2SECRET5. The Secretary of State for Employment said that theindustrial situation remained confused. There had been no signifi-cant change in the pattern of industrial action now in progress orplanned in the gas industry, on the railways, in the National health service (NHS), in London schools and in British Road Services.Workers at some of Ford&apos;s factories had rejected a call by shop stewards for strike action; and the management were still hoping tobe able to achieve a settlement within the limits permitted by the paypolicy. The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) seemed likelyto decide to hold a ballot of their members about strike action after their Executive meeting on 8 March. There now appeared to be asubstantial element within the trade union movement which was
apprehensive about the possible outcome of a major confrontationwith the Government.In discussion the following main points were made (a) Reports from the British Gas Corporation (BGC) indicated that the attitude of the gas workers was hardening and that thesituation might deteriorate further by the following weekend. TheBGC now appeared more concerned to preserve good relations withthe unions than to support the Governments pay policy; and itwould be necessary to fortify them in standing firm. It would alsobe necessary to try to anticipate any impression that the Govern-ment might have created unnecessary alarm about the risks to safetyimplicit in the action of the gas workers.(b) At a meeting with the Secretary of State for Social services on the previous day the unions representing the NHS ancillary workers had expressed concern about the fact that the Secretary ofState had sent a personal letter to all ancillary workers. They had also warned him that the proposed official industrial action, due to start on 1 March, would be extended if any attempt wasmade to use volunteers to replace those taking such action. In thesecircumstances it was not easy to judge what attitude on the part ofthe Government would be best calculated to assist moderate union leaders to maintain control over militant elements. But, although they would in any case be bound publicly to react against any initiative taken by employers to counter industrial action, they oftenwelcomed such initiatives privately if they helped them to resistmilitancy among their members.(c) At a meeting on redundancy pay that day the NUM had appeared to realise that a ballot at the present time would be unlikely to show the necessary 55 per cent majority of their members in favour of strike action. They were not anxious to bring their pay negotiations to a head at the present time.(d) The one-day strike by Civil Servants was liable to lead to difficulties in the processing of forms connected with the change-over from Purchase Tax to Value Added Tax.(e) The strike by Civil Servants would cause particular difficulties for airline operations, where the information required by air traffic Control officers would not be available because Air traffic control Assistants and Teleprinter Operators would be on strike.The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) would therefore need to impose restrictions on the number of aircraft movements and expected onthis basis to be able to deal with some 25 per cent of normal trafficvolume, excluding military flights which would not be affected, theCAA had made such arrangements as they could with neighbouringAir Traffic Control authorities in Europe; but they would need toinform the Airline operators urgently of the steps which they could take to ease their problems. One possibility was to re-scheduleflights to off-peak hours, which would involve increased night flightsduring the nights of either 26-27 February or 27-28 February.Operators might not wish, or be able to take advantage of thiscourse; but before the CAA encouraged them to try to do so they
wished to be sure that the Government would not raise objection on the grounds of the possible public criticism of the additionalnoise at night. There was no ban or limit on night flights duringwinter time; and in any case the strike by Civil Servants seemed toprovide an adequate answer to any criticism. On the other hand itwas important not to take any steps which might provoke furtherindustrial action. This might occur, for example, if the immigration officers or the members of the Transport and General Workers&apos;Union providing ground handling services at airports were asked toundertake extra duties. Taking into account that the likely absenceof Customs and Immigration staff would facilitate the entry into thiscountry of illegal immigrants and goods normally subject to controland taking also into account the limited benefits to be gained fromre-scheduling flights, it might be preferable not to facilitate morethan the minimum number of flights whilst the effects of the strikewere being felt. The extra duties for staff caused by the clearance of delayed aircraft would be less liable to cause resentment thanthose which would arise from the planned re-scheduling of flights.(/) There appeared to be a growing impression amongst theunions and their members that the groups seeking special consider-ation under paragraph 33 of the Stage 2 White Paper (Cmnd. 5205)would receive further pay increases as soon as Stage 3 came into forcein the autumn, whereas all concerned would have to wait until 12months after their 1972-73 increase. The unions should not be under any misapprehension, since the position had been made clear to them.Nevertheless, the terms of reference of the Pay Board and the priorities which the Government allotted to the treatment ofanomalies would be important in determining the time scale of progress towards the resolution of such anomalies. It must in anycase be brought home to the unions that the greater the total amountof money to be devoted to resolving problems of relativities andanomalies, the less would be available for wage increases for other groups. Nothing should be said at the present juncture which would prejudice some measure of preference for the low paid.(g) In the context of the treatment of anomalies it would be important that the reply to the letter from the Leader of theOpposition to the Prime Minister, proposing that a Royal commission should be set up to consider such cases during the period until the counter-Inflation Bill became law, should be couched in terms which, on the one hand, committed the Leader of the Opposition tosupport the Stage 2 policy and, on the other hand, gave him no opportunity to exploit the apparent delay in dealing with thesecases. A Royal Commission of the kind envisaged could have no official powers, for example, to compel individuals to give evidence;and it would therefore be unable to produce any more rapid oreffective results than would be achieved by the Governments proposal that members of the Pay Board should start to consider submissionson individual cases even before the Board was formally constituted.On the other hand, unless the names of the Board could be announcedvery quickly, there was a risk that public opinion would considerthat the Government had been unsympathetic to a proposal which appeared on the face of it to be a helpful and constructive suggestion.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that in his reply to the Leader of the Opposition he would welcome his agree-ment that the Pay Board should consider problems of anomalies aspart of a general pattern and that the Board&apos;s finding should be for application only in Stage 3. He would point out, however, that theGovernment intended to establish the Pay Board in the very nearfuture and to invite them to make an immediate start on consideringanomalies and that the constitution of the members of the Board asa Royal Commission in the meantime would therefore be unnecessary.The Lord Privy Seal should consider further the desirability of re-scheduling civil air flights during the strike by Civil Servants on27 February.The Cabinet 1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider the desirability of re-scheduling civil air flights during the strike by CivilServants on 27 February.Tenancies of high rateable value DwellingsPreviousReference:CM (73) 7thConclusions,Minute 1CONFIDENTIAL6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary (CP (73) 19) and the Secretary of State for the Environment(CP (73) 21).The Home Secretary said that in accordance with the Cabinefsconclusion at their 7th Meeting he had indicated in CP (73) 19 the courses which might be adopted in response to pressure from Govern-ment supporters representing constituencies in Inner London toamend the Counter-Inflation Bill in order to provide powers for controlling the rents of high rateable value (RV) tenancies Therewere in fact two classes of tenants who were at present unprotectedand might be thought to be entitled to some relief some 20,000who were occupying unfurnished accommodation with a RV ofmore than  400 in London or  200 elsewhere; and some 600,000tenants of furnished accommodation. The latter tended to be concentrated in conurbations and areas of housing stress; and ahigh proportion consisted of very poor families. They had access toRent Tribunals but no security of tenure. In these circumstances there seemed to be four possible courses of action to stand firm andto seek to defeat any amendment tabled on Report; to take no action now but to announce that the Government intended tobring forward proposals in due course; to accede to the wishes of the inner London Members by freezing the rents of high RV rentedproperties for the duration of the counter-inflation measures; and to accede forthwith to the longer-term wishes of the Inner LondonMembers by raising the RV limits in perpetuity. Of these courses thesecond could probably be dismissed without further consideration,since it would merely constitute an incentive to landlords to sell off all
their vacant property forthwith in order to anticipate the eventuallegislation; and the prospects of tenants would therefore becomeeven worse than at present.In discussion, it was emphasised that, if the concern of the inner london Members about these issues could not be satisfied, the government&apos;s position in the subsequent stages of the Counter-Inflation Bill might be prejudiced. Moreover, there was no doubtthat in some instances rent increases, which were not necessarilyunreasonable in themselves, could cause genuine hardship to the tenants of high RV unfurnished accommodation at a time when strictlimitations were being imposed on increases in income.On the other hand, the magnitude of the problem should not be exaggerated. The number of leases of high RV unfurnishedproperties which would be ending during Stage 2 would be quitesmall; and even in these cases many of the tenants concerned wouldbe able to afford a higher rent. Moreover, the Francis Committeehad in 1971 recommended in the opposite sense and had proposedthat the scope of control should be reduced by lowering the RV ofunfurnished properties subject to control in London from  400 to 300. Nor could action in practice be limited to the category of tenants with whom the Inner London Members were principally concerned, since in the interests of equity some comparable reliefwould have to be provided for the tenants of furnished accommoda-tion, whose need for help was even greater. It would be essential togive them security of tenure, since the average period of security atpresent being awarded by Rent Tribunals was not sufficientto cover the period of Stage 2. But this would be alegislatively complex operation, for which the Counter-InflationBill was not a suitable vehicle. Moreover, furnished tenantswere not a homogeneous group. They consisted of at least two categories, those sharing a house with the owner-occupier and those living in separate accommodation provided by a landlord who was acting professionally; and different arrangements would be needed for each category. But to extend the area of rent control and to provide security of tenure would result in a reductionin the supply of rented accommodation, since there would be no incentive to build new properties for renting while landlords ofexisting rented accommodation would become increasingly liable tosell as soon as current leases came to an end. The effect on the supplyof rented accommodation had always been a major objection to theextension of rent control; and this argument would apply in principleeven if controls lasted only for the duration of Stage 2. In fact,however, it was doubtful whether it would be realistic to assume thatthey could be applied only temporarily; all past experience was tothe contrary. Moreover, even short-term controls might cast doubt on the validity of the Governmenfs fair rents policy, because itwould appear that the tenants of high RV unfurnished accommoda-tion (and the tenants of furnished accommodation if the new arrange-ments were to apply to them also) would be treated more favourablythan all other tenants, who were subject to fair rents. This wouldbe true even if limited rent increases, perhaps based on some form
of index-linking, were allowed during Stage 2, despite the consider-able administrative difficulties which such an arrangement wouldinvolve.In further discussion it was suggested that a remedy might befound in the powers under which, where rents were being increasedby wholly unreasonable amounts, the premises concerned could be acquired compulsorily by a public authority and then sold to a housing Association formed by the tenants themselves. It was doubtful, however, whether such action would solve the problem,partly because the flats concerned would not always be concentrated incompact blocks and partly because at present values the cost, andthe consequential demands on Exchequer borrowing, would be excessive.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewould be considerable political attraction in measures designed togive some protection to tenants of furnished and of highRV unfurnished accommodation during Stage 2. A rigidfreeze would not be appropriate, since it was not being applied elsewhere; and it might be preferable to provide forrent increases to be subject to some form of permissible maximum.The Cabinefs discussion, however, had shown that there would be considerable difficulty in implementing this concept satisfactorily;and the Lord President, in consultation with the Secretary of Statefor the Environment and the Chief Whip, should accordingly seek an early discussion with the Inner London Members concerned inorder to explain the nature of the problem to them in greater detail and to try to persuade them to accept counter-inflationary legislation which did not contain any additional provisions about the control of rents. In the light of the outcome of this exchange of views theCabinet could revert to the matter, if necessary, at their next meeting.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord President of theCouncil, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned,to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office,22 February, 1973.
