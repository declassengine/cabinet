Debate on northern IrelandC on stitutionalProposalsIt was important that during the debate on the Governmentsconstitutional proposals for Northern Ireland the many government supporters who were in favour of the proposals should be encouraged to express their views.previous reference:CM(73) 16thConclusions,Minute 5In the course of informal discussions with the Opposition in theHouse of Lords it had been suggested that, in the interests ofdemonstrating publicly the essential agreement between the two main Parties, on the situation in Northern Ireland, it would be preferable that the debate on the White Paper in the House of lords should not precede that in the House of Commons.    Efforts werebeing made to rearrange business for this purpose.Presentation ofGovernmentPoliciesPreviousReference:CM(73) 16thConclusions,Minute 1Recent Press reports indicated that there was still misapprehensionabout the application of Stage 2 of the Government^ counter-inflationary policies to the entitlement of coal miners to a longerholiday period.    This was a matter of urgent importance, becauseany misunderstanding on this issue might prejudice the outcome ofthe ballot which the National Union of Miners were promoting inorder to determine whether their members wished to have recourse to industrial action in support of their pay claim.    It would bedesirable to adopt a relatively moderate tone in any public commentin this context, in view of the sympathy which the miners werenaturally and rightly attracting at the moment as the result of aserious accident at a coal mine in Yorkshire on the previous day.But a series of factual advertisements which would shortly beappearing in the national Press would deal with this specific pointamongst others.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Home Secretary should consider, in consultation with theMinister for Industry, what arrangements should be made to securethe accurate presentation of the relevant facts both in the Press andon radio and television.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerfssumming up of their discussion and invited theHome Secretary, in consultation with the Ministerfor Industry, to proceed accordingly.- mtPARLIAMENTARY    1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons during the following week.
2. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that,following the Cabinetls decision on 30 January to reconstitute a true Contingency Reserve, he had been considering the bestprocedure for bringing proposals before the Cabinet,    He had concluded that he would find it very helpful to have some preliminaryard informal discussions with colleagues, in particular those whowere not themselves responsible for major programmes ofexpenditure.    He therefore proposed to consult the Home Secretary,the Lord President of the Council, the Lord Privy Seal and,whenever possible, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland;but the proposals which were ultimately submitted to the cabinet would, of course, reflect his own judgment and would be putforward on his own responsibility.
3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat HM Ambassador in Reykjavik, supported by officials from london, was carrying out exploratory discussions with the icelandic Government with a view to ascertaining whetherMinisterial negotiations could take place with a reasonable prospect of success.    It could be assumed that the IcelandicMinister of Fisheries, Mr Joseffson, who was a Communist,would continue to cause difficulty;  and it remained to be seen whether the views of the Prime Minister, Mr Johannesson and theForeign Minister, Mr Augustsson, who had asserted that they wished to renew negotiations, would prevail.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatunits of the Iraqi Army had seized a small piece of Kuwaititerritory and Kuwait had mobilised its forces.    It was too soon tosay whether armed conflict was likely, but it seemed probablethat Kuwait would try to resolve the matter through the good offices of the Arab League.    There were 40 British military advisers in kuwait; but the terms of their engagement excluded them frominvolvement in armed conflict.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.
STEEL PRICESPrevious&quot; Reference:CM(73) 17thConclusions,Minute 24. THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY said that, following themeeting of Ministers and the United Kingdom Ambassador to theEuropean Communities which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had held on the previous afternoon, he had informed the Chairman ofthe British Steel Corporation (BSC), Lord Melchett, of the disquietwhich the Government felt about their proposal to raise the realisedprices for steel by an average of over Uj per cent on 1 May.    as agreed at the meeting, he had proposed that, instead, they should announce an increase in average realised prices of 8 per cent with effect from 1 May, on the understanding that there could be afurther, unspecified, increase later in the year, which would be ofa size sufficient to ensure that their prices were not being subsidisedand that the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and theEuropean Commission could be assured that our existing undertaking to them in this respect was being honoured.    He had also informedLord Melchett that phased increases in prices on this basis wouldbe unlikely to be open to objection from the ECSC or from theCommission, provided that they were presented as reflecting theCorporation^ own commercial judgment.    In reply Lord Melchetthad indicated that the BSC wished to co-operate with the Governmentin their counter-inflation policies to the greatest possible extent and that, despite their strong preference for a single increase on1 May, would be willing to make the necessary increases in two stages.    On this basis, however, they would wish to announceforthwith that there would be increases in realised prices on 1 Mayof on average over 9 per cent (no reference being made to listprices) and that there would be further increases averaging5 per cent on 1 October, or a slightly larger increase if, becauseof the timing of the ending of Stage 2 of the counter-inflationarypolicy, that date were deferred until 1 November.    Lord Melchettregarded it as essential to announce both the timing and the amountof the second increase at the same time as the first increase was published in order to demonstrate to the Commission that the twoincreases together would in fact enable the BSC to make a profitduring the current financial year, to forestall criticism from theprivate sector of the steel industry and to reduce the risk of excessive advance ordering by customers, who would be liable to fear that the second stage increases would be considerably greaterthan in fact was intended.In discussion it was emphasised that the success of the Governmentspay and prices policy overrode all other considerations.    increases in steel prices, even on the basis now proposed, would jeopardisethat policy.    The bsc&apos;s proposals would involve an increase in the retail price index of 0.25 per cent;  and some individual increasesmight be over 20 per cent.    While it was important that we shouldbe seen to be honouring our obligations to the European EconomicCommunities (e.c.), we were still in the transitional stage of entryand the Commission must be prepared to take account of that fact.    It
was in any case unlikely that they would either wish, or be in aposition, to bring us before the European Court in the near future,particularly if they were given appropriate assurances as regardsthe longer term.    Moreover, it was far from clear that 5 per cent would be the appropriate level of increase for the second stage, inview of the difficulty which the BSC not infrequently experienced inaccurately forecasting their out-turn.    In any event a profit of 39 million in 1973-74 after interest, which was equivalent to a return of 6 per cent on net assets, seemed unnecessarily large inthe present circumstances.    There was no reason why our prices should be increased by the same amount as those of our Europeancompetitors;  and it might be possible to persuade the commission that our obligations under the Treaty of Paris would be met if the bsc were operating on a profitable basis by the end of the current financial year.    For all these reasons it would be desirable to try to persuade Lord Melchett to adopt the proposal put to him by theMinister for Industry in accordance with the agreement reached by ministers at the meeting on the previous day.On the other hand there were good grounds for believing that neither the ECSC nor the Commission were likely to accept withoutchallenge a situation in which the BSC would suffer an overall loss in 1973-74, even if their current trading was showing a surplus bythe end of the financial year;  and it would therefore be essentialto be in a position to demonstrate, when the initial price increase was announced, that there would be no element of subsidy in theseprices.    Moreover, it remained essential that the announcement should be presented as the Corporation^ own proposal, which theymust be willing to defend as such and as meeting their obligations to the ECSC.    It was very unlikely, however, that they would beprepared to do so unless they were free to specify bom the amount and the timing of the second stage increase.    The BSCscompetitors in Europe were well aware that the Corporation^prices were lower than theirs to an uncommercial extent;  and,since European steel prices would need to rise, the second stageincrease might need to be larger if the announcement were delayed until the autumn.    The private sector steel manufacturers were also well aware of the bsc&apos;s financial situation and would be liableto complain to the Commission if they thought the level of increaseinadequate,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were still seriously concerned about the probable impact on the Governments pay and prices policy of increases in steel prices of the order proposed,,    It was necessary to consider thelevel of acceptable increases in the context of the general upward movement of prices, the implications of which the Ministers most closely concerned would be considering later that day.    In the5
meantime, further consideration should be given to ways in whichit might be possible to reduce the level of the increases, includingthe suggestion that the e.c. Commission might be satisfied withan undertaking that the BSC would be operating on a profitablebasis by the end of the current financial year, instead of an assurance that they would make a profit during the year.Consideration should also be given to the possibility of persuading the Corporation to co-operate further in minimising the impact onthe prices policy, in particular by not insisting on the announcementof the amount and timing of the second stage increase at thepresent time.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Ministerand invited the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster to be guided accordingly.6*L*%j W riOei^S II iAIL
INDUSTRIALAFFAIRSm M&apos; National health service. Ancillary-workers, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES saidthat at a further meeting that morning the unions representing theNational Health Service ancillary workers had maintained their interest in the suggestion that a deadline might be set for theintroduction of incentive bonus schemes, as an element in their pay settlement.    They proposed now to discuss the situation withthe Trades Union Congress,previous preference:CM(73) 17thConclusions,Minute 1BritishRailways BoardPreviousReference:CM(73) 17thConclusions,Minute 1THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe British Railways Board had on the previous day made therailway unions a pay offer in accordance with the pay policy.The offer appeared to have been fairly favourably received; butthe unions had, as expected, asked for time to study it.    It seemed unlikely that industrial action by the members of the associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen would be resumed in the immediate future.The Gas and THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY said that no developments wereCoal Industries expected in either the gas industry or the coal industry until afterthe ballots of the gas workers and coalminers about the pay offersPrevious which had been made.Reference:CM(73) 17thConclusions,Minute 1The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Secretaryof State for Social Services, the Secretary ofState for the Environment and the Ministerfor Industry.Civil Service Unions THE LORD PRIVY SEAL reported on industrial action in the CivilService,    His report and the Cabinet1 s discussion are recordedPrevious separately.Reference:tl(73) 17thn elusions,Minute 1
6. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that the level of violence in Northern Ireland in the past three days had been exceptionally low.    The White Paper on constitutional Reform had been well received by moderate cpinionin the Province.    Mr Brian Faulkner had adopted a somewhatequivocal position; but he would probably decide in the end toparticipate in the arrangements which we proposed.    The SocialDemocratic and Labour Party had not yet expressed a view.    TheProvisional Wing of the Irish Republican Army had made nocomment.    Strong opposition had been expressed by the united front of Loyalists, in which Dr Paisley, Mr Craig and Mr Orrwere playing an active role.    But they were essentially rivalsfor the leadership of the Protestant faction;  and it was perhapsquestionable whether they would find themselves able to work together for very long.    Dr Paisley probably represented thegreatest danger;  and, together with Mr Orr, he could be expectedto mount a sustained attack on the Constitutional Bill when it came before Parliament.    It was desirable that elections to the assembly should take place in June; but it would require exceptional efforts to ensure that the Bill was enacted by then,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wish to congratulate the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on thesuccess of his efforts, culminating in the publication of the white paper.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement.
PRICE and pay CODEDraft WhitePaperPreviousReference: jjCM(73).10ftiConclusions7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP(73) 37), to which was annexed a revised draftof the White Paper on the Price and Pay Code,THE PRIME MINISTER said that, since the Cabinet had approved the version of the Code which had been published in the consultative document (Cmnd 5247), there had been consultations with the confederation of British Industry (CBI) and with the representativesof many industries and professions.    As a result a number of changes had been made in the text, most of which were designed tomake the Code, more fair and realistic.    In particular, thetreatment of prices and profits reflected certain alterations whichwere mainly designed to meet the criticism by the CBI that theGovernment^ earlier proposals would discourage investment.The revised version of the Code should enable the Government tomaintain the pressure on prices without damaging investment.In discussion the following main points were made -a. Paragraph 11, The second line should refer to&quot;whatever arrangements are eventually settled&quot; ratherthan &quot;agreed&quot;.b. Paragraph 32,    It was suggested that the choice of30 September as the base date for the calculation ofallowable costs, together with the omission of the provisionfor exceptions which had been included in paragraph 25 ofthe Consultative Document, might create difficulties for food manufacturers in view of the seasonal nature of their business.    Ever if there could be no change in paragraph 32,there might be scope for some amendment of paragraph 71on investment in order to meet this point.    It might be made clear, for example, that the paragraph applied not only to new investment but also to the maintenance of a satisfactorylevel of investment.c. Paragraphs 52-54.    It was suggested that the paragraphs about the anticipation of cost increases mightcreate difficulties for the construction industry and thatsome amendment of the text at this point might be desirable.d. Paragraph 131,    It was suggested that in thediscussion of promotion and regrading it might be better to delete the reference to groups of individuals and to makeit clear that the references to the pay limit included alsothe individual limit of  250,
THE PRIME MINISTER, slimming up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the substance of the draft White Paper for publication, as planned, on Monday 26 March.    The drafting amendments which had been proposed in discussion, together withany other changes which Ministers might wish to suggest, shouldbe communicated to the Treasury without delay.The Meeting -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office22 March 197310

Essential services were not being seriously affected, although action by staff engaged on computer operations in connection with the introductionof Value Added Tax (VAT) would inevitably have a cumulative effect.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, although the interruption of the operation of the VAT computer was causinginconvenience, this could be accepted for a further week or so.In these circumstances, and in view of the prospect that the CPSAmight resume normal working when the Counter-Inflation Billreceived the Royal Assent later that day, he proposed to take no specific steps to deal with the industrial action in the meantime.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office22 March 1973i
