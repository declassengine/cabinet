ParliamentaryAffairsExport of animals(Control)bill previous reference:CM (73) 3rdConclusions,Minute 1The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatarrangements should be made for the Bill to be blocked for as longas possible, so as to allow time for the Governmenfs attitude to befurther considered. It might be that, while a general ban on theimport of live animals into other e.c. countries would be contraryto the Treaty of Rome, a selective ban (for example one relating to aparticular class of animals or to the use of particular slaughter houses)would not. The Law Officers should be asked to consider this aspect also, and to submit their Opinion to the Ministers concerned at the earliest possible moment. In the light of it further consid-eration should be given to the policy issues raised by the Bill.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and theother Ministers principally concerned, to proceed asindicated in the summing up and to report the con-clusions reached to the Prime Minister.secret oversea 2.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the affairs peace treaty had not proved immediately effective.   FightingVietnam continued. The Communists evidently wanted to secure a provincialPrevious town in South Vietnam where they might set themselves up as an reference: alternative government; and they were seeking to cut the mainCM (72) 46th routes in order to make communication difficult for the SouthConclusions, Vietnamese Government. The international conference to which minute 1 the United States Government had invited a large number of othergovernments had the stated objective of bringing the war to an end and maintaining peace thereafter. We would attend the conference,1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet were informed that the export of Animals(Control) Bill had been blocked on 26 January, though not without difficulty. Support for it was however growing and a further increase could be expected as a result of the forthcoming appearance onBBC television of a film about the treatment of live animals exported from this country to France. It would therefore become increasingly difficult to find Members willing to object to the Bill. meanwhile it now appeared that an initiative by our representatives on theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) Commission on the linesdiscussed by the Cabinet at their meeting on 23 January had little chance of success. An Opinion had been sought from the LawOfficers on whether the Bill, should it become law, would be contraryto our e.c. obligations, but was unlikely to be available in less than two or three weeks.
but we could not concur in the American view of its continuingresponsibilities. When the Control Commission ran into difficulties,appeals should be directed to the Secretary General of the united nations, Dr. Waldheim, and not to the conference. Similarly theconference should not concern itself with the continuing problemsof aid. So far as national contributions were concerned, we shouldbe prepared to help with medical and similar supplies, through theInternational Red Cross or otherwise; but we would not be able toaccept the heavy burden of sharing the cost of rebuilding Vietnam.The Prime Minister said that he and the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary would be discussing Vietnam, and in particular thepurposes of the international conference, during their forthcoming visit to Washington.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that while theWestern countries would like the Conference to produce someconcrete achievements in matters of common interest, the soviet union were probably more interested in high-soUnding declarations.Nevertheless, the Soviet Union had not proved obstructive in thepreliminary discussions, and progress had been made on the agenda.The Conference, at the level of Foreign Ministers, would probablytake place in June.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theactivities of the freedom fighters in Rhodesia, the majority of whom had probably come from Mozambique rather than from Zambia,had caused Mr. Ian Smith to react unwisely by closing the Zambianfrontier except for the passage of copper. Rhodesia might suffermore than Zambia as a result of this ban and Mr. Smith might agreeto lift it provided he received some assurance from the Zambian side,even if this had to be of a private nature, that they would do whatthey could to prevent the border being used by freedom fighters.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary was now waiting to hearfrom the President of Zambia, Mr, Kaunda, whether he would beprepared to give such an assurance.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-. . wealth Secretary.secret. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that therecent meeting of the Council of Agricultural Ministers in Brusselshad dealt with outstanding questions on which decisions were neededbefore our adoption of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Thenegotiations had been difficult but the outcome had been generally
satisfactory. Subsequently, difficulties had arisen in Brussels overcompleting the necessary legal and admisistrative provisions in timefor the acceding countries to operate the CAP from 1 February; butit now seemed probable that we should be able to operate the systemfrom that date. The most important item on the agenda for theCouncil of Ministers Meeting on February concerned the nego-tiations with Norway. It was important on consumer grounds thatwe should succeed in obtaining free entry for Norwegian fish fillets.Community Ministers would also be considering shortly the futureof the EURATOM Joint Research Centre. There had so far been little progress in Brussels on the work programme set for theCommunity institutions by the European Summit, the new Corn-mission was still in the process of settling down. First impressionsof the Commission and of its President were favourable; it hadplayed a useful part in the negotiations on agriculture.In discussion it was suggested that the Community paidinsufficient attention to the problems of inflation. The commission had produced counter inflationary proposals which concentrated on tariff measures and were not likely to lead to significant results.The Council of Agricultural Ministers showed too great a readiness to accept higher prices; their decisions should be influenced by wider considerations, and in this the Foreign Ministers should have animportant role to play. It was noted that the Commissionerresponsible for Economic and Financial Affairs, Herr Haferkamp,was seized of the importance of food prices as an element in inflation.The Prime Minister summing up the discussion said that weshould press the Community to take a more positive approach tothe problem of inflation; if they were not prepared to do so wemust not allow ourselves to be hindered in carrying out our owncounter-inflationary policies. The European Unit should considerthe implications of the changes in price levels of agricultural commodities; where our prices had already reached Communitylevels there was a case for maintaining them rather than reducingthem and then increasing them again as part of the transitionarrangement. The delay in the translation of Community documentsinto English was unacceptable; Ministers and officials should nothave to work under the handicap of texts available only in French.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should take up thissubject as a matter of urgency with the President of the Commission.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to press for an improvement in the translation services.(3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food toarrange for the European Unit to consider the impli-cations for the transition arrangements of the course offood prices in the United Kingdom.
IndustrialAffairsProgrammefor ControllingInflation:The SecondStagePreviousReference:CM (73) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2CONFIDENTIAL4. The Secretary of State for Employment said that the TradesUnion Congress appeared reluctant to take the responsibility of adopting any definite attitude towards the second stage of the government&apos;s programme for controlling inflation. In these circum-stances, although it seemed unlikely that an official strike v/ould becalled in any of the major industries in the immediate future, thepossibility could not be ruled out that the present sporadic outbreaks of unofficial industrial action, in particular in the gas industry, theNational Health Service (NHS) and the Civil Service, might becomeconcerted into a campaign against the Governmenfs pay policyconcentrated on the problems of low-paid workers. Once suchaction started it would not be easy to contain. An example of the pressure being brought to bear on the Government was the Pressstatement issued by the National Union of Public Employees(NUPE) giving the results of a ballot of the union&apos;s branches aboutindustrial action. The NUPE had claimed a majority of 7 to 1 infavour of some sort of industrial action, basing their claim on acount of branches supporting such action. In fact only 56 per cent of those attending the branch meetings had voted in favour andthey comprised only 18 per cent of the total number of NUPEmembers employed in hospitals, which in turn constituted only one-third of the total number of NHS ancillary workers.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthere would undoubtedly be many misleading statements issued byunions in an attempt to defeat the Governmenfs pay policy. It was essential that immediate action should be taken to counter the effects of such statements and this could only be effectively done byMinisterial statements setting out the facts. The Home secretary should discuss with the Lord President how this might best beachieved.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in conjunction with the lord president, to consider what arrangements might best bemade to counter misleading propaganda about the effects of the Governmenfs pay policy.PublicExpenditurePrioritiesand ControlPreviousReference:CM (72) 58thConclusions,Minute 5CONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP (73) 8) on the arrangements for the examin-ation of public expenditure in 1973.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that in settling thepublic expenditure programmes for the period 1971-72 to 1976-77,the Cabinet had agreed on a continuing examination and criticalscrutiny to control total expenditure, the relationship between different parts of the programme, and their rate of increase.  Their
target for limiting the average growth in demand terms of expenditure over this period had only been achieved with difficulty, and the contingency reserve of  700 million by 1976-77 was already almost completely matched by foreseeable claims on it. These additionalclaims, which developments in the two months since the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion had tended to consolidate, were not reflected inthe White Paper on public expenditure; but even so, informedcomment in the Press had noted that the trend of public expenditure was dangerous in itself and uncharacteristic of a conservative administration. The figures annexed to his paper showed that although the planned level of public expenditure which the Govern-1ment had inherited had indeed been reduced by November, 1971,it was now running well above the level set by their predecessors in office. The Governmenfs supporters in Parliament were increasinglydisquieted by these indications; and overseas observers, particularlyin other countries of the European Economic Community, were already expressing surprise that more stringent measures had notyet been taken to tackle the rate of increase in public expenditure and to control the growth of the money supply. There were signs that pressure on resources might again emerge sooner than hadformerly been thought, and it was essential to ensure that, through-out the period covered by the Public Expenditure Survey, adequateresources would be available both to correct present trends in thebalance of trade and to provide for productive investment. To thisend he recommended that a true contingency reserve should be reconstituted, rising to at least  300- 400 million by 1976-77, fromsavings within the programmes themselves. He proposed actionon two fronts: first, the 1973 survey of public expenditure shouldbe conducted from the outset with political guidance on the areasof expenditure for which the Government would be prepared, thoughwithout specific commitment at that stage, to consider reducedpriority; second, the development of existing policies and new proposals for expenditure should be carefully monitored to ensurethat they did not erode the essential room for manoeuvre within thetotal programme. He had suggested, in Annex 3 to his memo-randum, an initial selection of programmes where the Cabinet mightbe prepared to consider some modification of the former level of priorities, but he hoped that his colleagues would also be ready toput forward their own proposals, and he might wish to suggestfurther additions to the list himself. He proposed that, in preparing the 1973 report of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESO,officials should be instructed, wherever the implications for expen-diture of existing policy up to 1977-78 were less than precise, to setout the forecasts in terms both of the interpretation which would normally be used and of an alternative feasible interpretationdesigned to produce a lower level of expenditure; and in areas suchas those noted in Annex 3 to his memorandum, to set out alternativelower costings, indicating the policy implications which would be involved, and tracing where appropriate alternative paths of expen-diture through the intermediate years to 1977-78.In discussion these proposals were generally welcomed. It was recognised that some scope must be available for the promotion of
new measures, for example in the field of the social services, towhich political importance was attached; and that this room for manoeuvre could only be achieved through savings on other programmes. The automatic continuance of existing programmes,revalued to take account of increased costs, should not be allowedto pass unchallenged. The list annexed to CP (73) 8 of ares which should be subject to special scrutiny could well be extended;and there might be advantage in the Cabinet reviewing theposition before the PESC report was presented to them. It mustbe expected that programmes involving investment in infrastructurecould more readily be adjusted in the longer term. But the Govern-ment had previously undertaken, at short notice, a number of measures designed to relieve unemployment. Now that theseasonally-adjusted level of unemployment was rapidly falling, andmore jobs were becoming available, these measures might yield scope for early economies. Projects for which Government assistance wassought under the Industry Act 1972 should be critically examined,and greater weight should be placed in future on the criterion of improved industrial efficiency, rather than the avoidance ofredundancies.In further discussion it was noted that the increase of public expenditure programmes was already putting the construction industry under strain, and shortages of skilled labour were alreadydeveloping in some areas. This was partly due to the industry&apos;sreluctance to take advantage of the training facilities available; andrenewed efforts should be made to persuade the industry to adopta responsible attitude towards its training needs.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theproblem raised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his memo-randum CP (73) 8 was both important and urgent. The Cabinetaccepted that it was necessary to reconstitute a true contingency reserve, and that this in practice meant identifying possible reduc-tions in existing public expenditure programmes. This would onlybe practicable if the necessary preparatory work was done beforethe Report on the Public Expenditure Survey was submitted to theCabinet. They agreed therefore with the proposals in CP (73) 8,and the Chancellor of the Exchequer should arrange for thenecessary action, with which the Central Policy Review Staff shouldbe associated, to be put in hand immediately. The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should also consider, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, whether other programmes could be added tothose selected for special scrutiny in Annex 3 to his memorandum.In addition to re-examining priorities for the medium term, theCabinet would wish particularly to examine the prospects for thenext two years in the light of the falling trend of unemployment, andto consider to what extent public expenditure programmes aimed atreducing unemployment might now be cut back. The Cabinet would resume their discussion of these issues early in March.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.
(2) Approved the proposals in CP (73) 8.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer (i) to instruct officials, in preparing the Report on the1973 Public Expenditure Survey, to act as pro-posed in paragraph 10 of CP (73) 8;(ii) to discuss further with the Ministers concernedwhether other programmes could be added tothose identified in Annex 3 to CP (73) 8;(iii) to examine, in consultation with the Ministers con-cerned, the scope for possible reductions in public expenditure during the coming two years, in thelight of the latest trends of unemployment, and toreport the outcome to the Cabinet in the courseof the coming month.Cabinet Office,30 January, 1973.
