TOP SECRET niiCABINETINTERNATIONA LMONETARYPOLICYPreviousReference:CM(73) 6thConclusions,Minute confidential annex cm(73) 13th Conclusions, Minute 2Monday 5 March 1973 at 11. 00 am the PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that his visit to Bonn atthe end of the previous week had coincided with a renewed! influx ofUnited States dollars into Europe which, on 1 March, had amountedto $3. 5 billion.    Of this sum the Federal German Republic had hadto accept no less than $2. 7 billion.    The greater part of his visit had therefore been devoted to a discussion with the Federal GermanChaneellor, Herr Brandt, of possible remedies for this situation.The Federal Chancellor had felt compelled to reject the Bundesbank&apos;suggestion that they should meet the challenge by continuing to acceptdollars in whatever amounvs they were offered.    He had judged thatit was doubtful whether this course would be effective and - evenmore important - that it would be regarded by the United StatesGovernment as a political affront,    Alternatively, the Deutschmarkcould be allowed to float unilaterally.    If so, however, thecurrencies of the other members of the European economic community (e.c.), with the exception of France, would probablyfollow the German lead;   German relations with France would be liable to suffer serious damage; and the cohesion of the e.c. wouldsuffeac    A third course would envisage the adoption of floating ratesof exchange by most members of the Community, with the exceptionof the United Kingdom, Italy and the Irish Republic, who would keep their rates as close as they could to those of the other member countries with the intention of bringing them into alignment as soonas possible.    Finally, it would be possible for the United Kingdomand Italy to agree that from the outset their rates should float in concert with those of the other members of the e.c., the resultbeing in effect a joint Community float which, although it might involve some difficulty as regards the relation between the paritieswithin the Community itself, should insulate the Community as awhole against the pressure of the United States dollar.    For thispurpose, however, it would be essential that the reserves of the member countries should be pooled and that sterling should be assured of unlimited support, free of interest, for an indefinite period.    A solution of this kind, which would have the greatThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limitedIt is issued for the personal use of ...S^3uJjilLCopy No.
advantage of relieving us of the sole liability for the sterling balances, would imply that the concept of European monetaryunion, which had hitherto been envisaged as not capable of achievement until 1980, would be advanced by a single stroketo 1973.    It would therefore be a very bold and imaginative course,which would need to be based primarily upon an act of political will.Herr Brandt had clearly found it an attractive concept and had agreedthat it should be further examined at a subsequent meeting of theFinance Ministers of the Community,,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had attended the meeting of Finance Ministers on the previous day, when they had discussed the situation in the light of other, less acceptable,proposals put forward both by the European Commission andby the International Monetary Fund,    Opinion had been divided,the Federal German Government leading those who favoured a commonCommunity float, the French Government preferring to defend the new-parities which had been established a few weeks earlier^ oh the groundthat these had now found their correct level and should not bedisturbed by any further floating adopted in protection againstpurely speculative movements.    The Federal Finance minister had shown no particular disposition to favour the pooling of reserves which the Prime Minister and the Federal German Chancellor had discussed two days earlier; and, if we wished to pursue it, theinitiative must clearly lie with us.    It had been agreed that thevarious possible courses of action should now be further examined in preparation for resumed discussions between the Ministers ofFinance later in the week.    In the meantime the currency markets of members of the Community would formally remain closed.    Inpractice, however, commercial transactions would continue, on theunderstanding that there would be no intervention by Governments insupport of individual rates; and for practical purposes, therefore,the rates of all members of the Community were now floating.There had initially been some suspicion on the part of the UnitedStates authorities that the members of the Community were seeking to resolve the problem without adequate regard to the interestseither of the United States themselves or of Japan,    But we hadbeen able largely to dispel these fears; and the Secretary of theUnited States Treasury would probably attend the resumedMinisterial discussions later in the week.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of these statements by thePrime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer,,Cabinet office March 1973
