CONFIDENTIALPublic Order 1.   The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that threeTerrorist individuals, whose identity had not yet been precisely established,Attack on had attacked the offices of the Indian High Commission in AldwychIndian High earlier that morning. Two of them had been killed in the subsequentCommission encounter with the Police; the third had been captured; and two members of the staff of the High Commission had been injured.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Home Secretary.IndustrialAffairsCounter-InflationPolicyPreviousReference:CM (73) 7thConclusions,Minutes 1and 5SECRET2. The Secretary of State for Employment said that the scale of industrial action against the Governmenfs pay policy was increasing. The General Council of the Trades Union Congress(TUC) had decided by a narrow majority to convene a specialCongress on 5 March, which would meet against a background ofindustrial action in the gas industry, on the railways, in the national health Service (NHS), in the Civil Service, in London schools andpossibly at Fords, with, additionally, a threat of such action in thecoal industry. The Finance and General Purposes Committee of the tuc would meet on 28 February in order to draft a resolution forthe consideration of the special Congress. This might take the formof a declaration of the tuc&apos;s opposition to the Governmenfs pay and prices policy and a call for the restoration of free collective bargaining, together with some expression of support for thoseunions which decided to take industrial action on their claims. Therewould be pressure from militant elements at the special Congressfor a national one-day strike. This, however, would probably be un-successful; and at present the risk of a general strike seemed remote.But the support for a national one-day strike would increase ifsanctions were implemented against individual unions. The possi-bility of invoking the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act inthe present circumstances had been examined. But it seemed unlikelythat the requirements with which any application for a &quot;cooling off&quot;period would need to comply could be met; and the Industrial court would be likely to regard such an application as intended merely to prevent industrial action from taking place until the powers under the Counter-Inflationary Bill were available to the Govern-ment. In general, however, the unions did not appear to be seekingan outright confrontation with the Government; a more probabledanger was a progressive deterioration in the industrial climate,which both the Government and the TUC might find difficult toprevent.In discussion the following main points were made (a) Over 7,000 men were now on strike in the gas industry; anda further 30,000 were operating a ban on overtime and working to rule. 12,000 workers hi affected industries had had to be laid off;and 2f million consumers had suffered reduced gas pressure. Afterprotracted negotiations the threat of a 24-hour strike in the South-SEOIET
Eastern Gas Board area on the following day, which would havemade it necessary to cut off the supply in the area and, possibly, to curtail natural gas supplies generally, had now been averted. As aresult the supply in the South-East should be maintained at a reduced, but safe, pressure. Although a critical situation had been only narrowly averted, the British Gas Corporation remained ofthe view that Emergency Powers were not required^ not least inview of the risk of a deterioration in their relations with the unions,which could persist after the dispute had ended. In these cir-cumstances it would be difficult for the Government to claim thatEmergency Powers were needed in order to maintain public safety.(b) The unions representing the NHS ancillary workers had decided to take official industrial action from 1 March. The formof action, which would be co-ordinated by regional committees,would vary from hospital to hospital and might comprise one-daystrikes, overtime bans or a withdrawal of co-operation. It was proposed to discuss with the unions on 21 February the steps which&apos;they would be prepared to take in order to keep vital services in hospitals in operation.(c) The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and firemen had decided to hold a 24-hour strike on 28 February, whichwould apply to drivers employed by London Transport as well asthose employed by the British Railways Board (BRB). In the mean-time their members employed by the BRB had refused to workunrostered overtime or on rest days. Although this had led to somecurtailment of rail services, the situation was not at present serious.(d) Manual workers in the water industry were waiting on developments in the gas industry but seemed unlikely to wish to takeindustrial action. There was still scope for a small increase in the pay offer without any breach of the Stage 2 pay policy.(e) It appeared likely that the National Union of Mineworkerswould seek arbitration on the question of the consolidation of theirrest days into their holiday entitlement,(/) Ministers had so far been successful in maintaining favour-able publicity for the Governments pay and prices policy. Therewere now some indications, however, of a gradual erosion of public support for the Government; and it would be important in the periodof a fortnight before the Budget to make a renewed effort to countersuggestions of Government inactivity in the face of industrial unrest.Ministers would also need to consider their attitude towards the tuc&apos;s proposals in their document &quot; Economic Policy.and collective bargaining, 1973 &quot;. Although the General Secretary of the TUCwas under instructions not to seek discussions with the Government,there was little doubt that he would welcome an invitation to exchange views about the tuc&apos;s proposals. In present circum-stances, however, a meeting could do little more than provide additional advertisement for those proposals, whereas the Govern-ment should be mainly concerned to secure more effective publicity for the measures which they had already taken in order to relievehardship, e.g. the proposed increases in rent rebates arid allowances.
It would also be necessary to consider what more could be saidpublicly on the vulnerable areas of policy, such as food prices and rates.(g) There would be strong pressure for the Government to find time for a debate in the House of Commons on the forthcomingConsultative Document on the Price and Pay Code, which was dueto be published by the Government on 26 February. It would bebetter to volunteer time for this purpose than to yield to Oppositionpressure; and the debate on the Defence White Paper, which was due to be held on 5 March, should be deferred in order to providethe necessary time. It would also be desirable to issue a statementsimultaneously with publication of the Consultative Document, inorder to describe the procedure which the proposed Pay board would follow in examining the problems of relativities and anomaliesin accordance with paragraph 33 of the Stage 2 White Paper(Cmnd. 5205):The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet must be prepared to face a difficult period of industrial unrest until the Counter-Inflation Bill received the Royal Assent.Every effort should therefore be made to expedite the bill&apos;s passage.The Cabinet agreed that the situation in the gas industry did not justify the Government in recommending the proclamation of aState of Emergency at the present time. The Secretary of State for defence and the Lord President should consider, in consultationwith the Home Secretary, what additional steps might be taken inorder to maintain the momentum of Government publicity insupport of the pay and prices policy; and the Secretary of State forthe Environment should consider arranging an early campaign tobring home to the public the benefits from the increased rent rebatesand allowances. He himself would discuss with the Ministers most closely concerned what steps might be taken to deal with the problemof food prices; and he would discuss further with the Chancellorof the Exchequer the question of the Governments attitude towardsthe tuc&apos;s economic proposals. The Cabinet would have an oppor-tunity later in the week to consider the draft Consultative document on the Price and Pay Code; and the Secretary of State for Employ-ment should prepare the draft of a statement, which might be issued at the same time as the Consultative Document, explaining themachinery for dealing with cases under paragraph 33 of Cmnd. 5205.Time should be made available; on 5 March for a debate on the consultative Document in the House of Commons.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence and the lord president, in consultation with the Home Secretary, toconsider further publicity measures in support of the pay and prices policy.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment to con-sider an early publicity campaign ori rent rebates and allowances.
(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Employment to prepare adraft statement on the machinery for dealing with casesunder paragraph 33 of Cmnd. 5205.reorganisation of the NuclearDesign andConstructionIndustryPreviousReference:CM (72) 40thConclusions,Minute 5SECRET3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry (CP (73) 15) about the reorganisation of the nuclear design and construction industry.The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry said that the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy had endorsed his recommendation that the nuclear design and construction industry should be based on the private sector. This view also had the general support of the industry and the electricity supply authorities. Inview of the weakness of the existing consortium structure, a singlecompany must henceforward take the lead; and the General ElectricCompany (G.C) were the only existing company with the necessaryexperience and strength for the purpose, despite the hostility withwhich many other firms would undoubtedly receive a decision tothis effect. It should be possible to negotiate acceptable terms withGEC, including reserved rights for the Government as regardspurchasing policy, international collaboration and the control of shares. Government intervention should be limited, however, tothose matters which were properly the Governmenfs concern.Annex I to CP (73) 15 described three possible structures for thenew company. The most effective arrangement would be onewhereby G.C would hold the majority of the shares, other private interests would be offered around 20 per cent and the Governmentwould hold the smallest minority stake consistent with securing theirreserved rights effectively and demonstrating their commitment tothe success of the company. CP (73) 15 also included detailed proposals for a non-executive Nuclear Power Advisory Board,representative of the major interests concerned, which would providethe Government with concerted advice on civil nuclear strategy.Once satisfactory arrangements had been concluded with GECon this basis, an early announcement of the Governmenfs decisions should be made; and a high-level team, led by the Minister for industry, should visit Europe and North America in order to obtain an up-to-date and authoritative assessment of nuclear capabilitiesabroad, which would assist the Government in formulating a strategy for international collaboration.In discussion there was support in principle for the view thatmanagement of the proposed design and construction company should be invested in G.C; any adverse reaction by other firms inthe industry should be discounted in the light of the very limitedsuccess which they themselves had had in developing nuclear power.But some concern was expressed that the proposed arrangement might allow G.C to pursue their own commercial advantage without adequate regard to the wider national interests. In this respect there
might be advantage in an arrangement under which the Governmentand G.C each held 40 per cent of the shares and G.C managed thenew company on a fee basis. G.C would then be accountable tothe partners in the company (who would include other private sectorinterests, although with restricted rights) and not to their own parentcompany alone; and this solution might command greater support in Parliament, in the industry as a whole and among the trade unions concerned. Moreover, the Government would enjoy greater freedomof action, since they would be able subsequently either to enlargeGECs shareholding in order to give them control of the company,if that seemed desirable, or to retrieve it and to make a fresh start ona different basis. The Governments essential rights could be reservedby the possession of a single share; and there seemed no objection in law to a minority shareholder being given the right to demand thewinding up of the company. Whatever the precise arrangements,however, G.C would insist on controlling the management of thecompany: and the Governments reserved rights should not be soexercised, in terms of excessive intervention in day to day adminis-tration, as to nullify this stipulation.In further discussion it was agreed that it would be beneficial to the nuclear industry to be able to take advantage of GECsmarketing capacity. It was not certain, however, whether G.C, whowere known to favour the American Westinghouse reactor system,would pay sufficient attention to the claims of alternative Britishdesigns, even though they would ultimately depend on the central electricity Generating Board (CEGB) for contracts and on theGovernment for most of their development funds, at least in theearly years. There was, indeed, some cause for concern whetherthe connection between the new company&apos;s marketing function andthe basic research which would continue to be conducted by the atomic Energy Authority (sea) had been satisfactorily worked out,particularly if G.C were to own a majority of the shares. Thispoint, which was critical to the success of any new arrangement,needed further examination.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were inclined to agree in principle that the nuclear design and construction industry should be based on the private sector andthat the leading role should be taken by G.C. But opinions were divided on the merits of this control being exercised through amajority shareholding or under a management contract. TheSecretary of State for Trade and Industry should therefore circulate a further memorandum developing the merits of each option,defining the essential rights which the Government would need to reserve and describing the manner in which a satisfactory relation-ship should be established between G.C and the sea. The cabinet would also wish to give further consideration to the role and composition of the Nuclear Power Board and to the proposal that ahigh-level team should visit Europe and North America.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
