parliamentary affairs. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.NorthernIreland(Assembly) bill the Cabinet were informed that it was hoped to conclude an informal arrangement with the Opposition in the House ofCommons which would enable all stages of the NorthernIreland (Assembly) Bill to be completed on 16 April.    Itwould be helpful if all stages of the Bill in the House of Lordscould be completed before the Easter recess, or, failing that,in time to enable Royal Assent to be given well before 11 May,which was the latest date which would enable the elections inNorthern Ireland to take place on the date planned.CAPITALPUNISHMENT2. The Cabinet were informed that the House of commons would on 11 April be considering a Motion by Mr E M Taylor MP,tinder the Ten Minute Rule, seeking leave to bring in a Bill toprovide for capital punishment to be the penalty for murderinvolving the use of firearms or explosives and for the murder of a police or prison officer.    There were indications thatthere was some increase in feeling in favour of the restorationof capital punishment amongst Government backbenchsupporters, though there did not at present appear to be a comparable shift of opinion in the country at large.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were agreed that the Home Secretary would seek an early opportunity of stating publicly that theGovernment did not intend to take any initiative to change thestatus quo.    He might then go on to indicate his own personal views why restoration was undesirable.    When the matter came before Parliament, the decision should be left to a free vote;and there seemed little doubt that the majority of Members werein fact opposed to the restoration of capital punishment.    that being so, the potential divisive effects of the issue amongstGovernment supporters would be kept to a minimum if mr Taylor&apos;s Motion were defeated by a substantial majority.It was of some significance that Mr Taylor1 s Bill was in factseriously defective, so that mevay of those who favoured therestoration of capital punishment might feel that abstention wasthe right course.
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.Northern Ireland: The Cabinet were also informed by THE SECRETARY of criminal Justice STATS FOR NORTHERN IRELAND of his decision in aAct particular case recently considered by the Court of Criminal--- Appeal in Northern Ireland.    The Secretary of state  sstatement is recorded separately.Mr Albert Brown 2
OVERSEAAFFAIRSArms ShipmentsPreviousReference:CM(73) 19thConclusions,Minute 23. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH secretary said that arms deliveries to Libya had been suspended sinceshe was almost certainly involved in the supply of armsfound on board the vessel Claudia and intended for the irish republican Army.    The matter could be reviewed whenstudy of the evidence that the arms had been loaded at Tripoliwas complete.Five-PowerDefenceArrangementsPreviousReference:CM(73) 19thConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Australian High Commissioner had informed him thathis Government envisaged a programme of phased withdrawal from Singapore which would lead, by April 1975, to thecomplete withdrawal of Australian personnel in support ofthe ANZUK force there, and might wish to make an announce-ment after their partners in the Five-Power defence arrangements had been informed.    This was totallyinconsistent with the assurances given to the Secretary ofState for Defence in February, and if the Australianspersisted it would create serious difficulties.    He had sent a message to the Australian Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, tosay that this matter would have to be discussed with himwhen he visited London at Easter, and that it was hoped thatthere would be no announcement in the meantime.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.3
4. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster said that at the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 9-10 Aprilthere would be a further discussion of Hie proposals made bythe Commission of the European Communities for changes inprice8 under the common agricultural policy (CAP) for 1973-74;but agreement was unlikely and a further meeting would almost certainly be necessary in the following week.    The ministerial committee on Europe had considered the proposals and agreed onthe line which the Minister for Agriculture would take at the nextCouncil meeting.    Although the immediate effect on United Kingdomfood prices would be slight the psychological impact on the counter-inflationary programme could be harmful.    TheCommittee had therefore agreed that, although at the end of theday the generality of United Kingdom interests in the Communitymight be harmed if we were not prepared to give any ground onfarm prices, we must nevertheless press our case very hard andaim to limit any concessions to the minimum and to thosecommodities where they would do least harm.    In particular weshould resist the proposal for an overall price increase of2. 76 per cent for most commodities which was intended to off-set in Germany and the Benelux countries the effects of proposed changes in the system of monetary compensatory amounts.In discussion it was argued that the practice of the CommunityAgricultural Ministers meeting as a separate Council meant that decisions on farm prices did not take proper account of wider considerations and in particular the need to combat inflation;this problem was enhanced by the political base of the agriculture ministers in some Community countries.    We had raised thepossibility that Finance Ministers should also attend the meetingsof the Agricultural Council at which CAP prices were to bediscussed but the idea had not found much favour in othercapitals; there was already a tendency in the Community tosuspect the United Kingdom of promoting moves which were aimed at undermining the CAP.    We might, however, consider using the Summit reference to the need for Community action against inflation as a basis for proposing a programme of anti-inflationaryaction to which all member countries could subscribe, and whichwould comprehend the common agricultural policy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that itwas most unsatisfactory that the Community Agriculture ministers should be able to make decisions on farm prices without taking account of wider considerations.    The containment of prices wasvital to the success of the Governments counter inflationary measures.    He would arrange for further consideration to begiven to ways of subjecting the work of the Agriculture Councilto wider policy considerations.The Cabinet -1.     Took note, iviih approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing tap of tba discussion.4-EUROPEANCOMMUNITYAFFAIRSFarm Prices
Public THE PRIME MINISTER said that the public presentation of the presentation issue of CAP prices would require very careful handling.    Hehad asked the Parliamentary Secretary, Civil Service Departmentto circulate a note of guidance.    More generally he was concerned at the way in which the Press had access to discussions in theCouncil of Ministers.    This inhibited Ministers in their negotiations and sometimes led to reports which were embarrassing to defend at home.    He asked his colleagues to bear these points in mind in their dealings with the Press both here and in Brussels.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement.representation at Meetings of ^the Council ofMinistersTHE PRIME MINISTER said that it was desirable to avoidtossthe situation where the United Kingdom/represented by more than two Ministers at Council Meetings.    There were of coursepolitical pressures which made it desirable for Ministers with responsibilities for Scotland, &quot;Wales and Northern Ireland to beseen to visit Brussels., ard this need might be partly met by theMinisters concerned making special visits for discussions withCommunity representatives on points of particular concern.The cabinet. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisterJs statement.5
5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERNIRELAND said that there had been more terrorists arrestedin the Province and brought to court in the last month than inany similar period in the past four years.    The level of violence had also been relatively low.    There were serioustensions within the Unionist Party, but Mr Faulkner wouldprobably retain the leadership.    Mr Craig, who had left theUnionist Party, appeared at present to be fairly isolated.The White Paper had been given an impressively favourable reception even in traditionally difficult Catholic areas.    Thelocal government elections would be held, as planned, on 0 May.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he understood that it had not proved possible to include in theNorthern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill a provision to enable the recruitment of women into the Ulster DefenceRegiment (UDR) and that if this was to be done a separateshort Bill would be necessary.    In view of the increasingparticipation by women in the terrorist activities of the irish republican Army it would be useful to have women in the UDRfor searching purposes but he recognised that a Bill might lead to argument about related issues such as the extent ofRoman Catholic recruitment into the UDR.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, saidthat it was likely that a short Bill would prove contentious,but the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland should takesoundings with the Opposition to discover how strong an attitude they would take to it.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.6
INDUSTRIALAFFAIRSNational health service Ancillary-WorkersPreviousReference:CM(73) 19thConclusions,Minute 56. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENTsaid that, while there were increasing aigns that the unionsrepresenting the National Health Service (NHS) ancillary workers were anxious to bring their pay dispute to an end,there might be an attempt, at the special meeting of theFinance and General Purposes Committee of the TUC on thefollowing day, to involve the NHS electricians in industrial action.   The Electrical, Electronic and TelecommunicationsUnion were, however, unlikely to wish to become involved inthe dispute.The London Docks      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT saidthat all dockers employed in the enclosed London docks were now on strike in protest at the Stage 2 limit on their pay settlement.    Attempts to extend the strike *o riverside docksin London and to other ports had so far failed.    There were^X     some indications that the strike, called by an 18-man joint ja^committee of the Transport and General Workers1 Union and&quot;the National Association of Stevedores and Dockers, might beended by a decision of a mass meeting of dockers due to takeplace on the following day.FordsPreviousReference:CM(73) 12thConclusions,Minute 4THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thatthe attitude of the workers employed by Fords to the company %latest pay offer was still undetermined.    The workers atDagenham, for example, had voted on the one   hand to rejeccthe offer and on the other against an overtime ban.    There wasto be a further meeting of the union negotiators on thefollowing day, but it seemed unlikely that any serious industrial action would develop.The Water Industry THE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR THE ENVIRONMENTsaid that early indications were that the outcome of the ballotPrevious of manual workers in the water industry which was now takingReference: place would be against industrial action.CM(73) 15thConclusions,Minute 6 -
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion,said that, with 3 million workers having now received pay increases deferred during the pay standstill and a furtherlj million having accepted subsequent increases based on the stage 2 pay policy, the Governments pay policy was increasingly becoming accepted.    While the presentation ofthat policy should continue in the present vein, the emphasis should now be concentrated on obtaining understanding of,and support for, the Governments policy on prices.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.8
BUILDINGSOCIETIESMortgage a (Interest Rates]Previous&quot;Reference:CM(73) 21stConclusions7. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, as agreed at the previous meeting, he had seen Sir Stanley Morton,the Chairman of the Building Societies Association (BSA)  with  other members of the Association.    He had asked sir Stanley Morton to consider the possibility that the recentfall in deposits might be attributable to the sharp rise inconsumer expenditure in anticipation of value added tax (VAT);this view was supported by the similar decline in investment in national savings.    He had suggested to him that, since thebuilding societies borrowing rate was fully competitive with national savings, and since it was possible that interest ratesin general were now stabilised, the Building Societies could hold their rates at the present level.    Sir Stanley Morton had said that now that the Provincial and Huddersfield building societies had raised their rates to 9j per cent the others had no alternative but to follow; he agreed that this stats of affairs was unsatisfactory.    When asked about the likely effect on thebuilding programme Sir Stanley Morton had said (in contradictionto the opinion he had previously expressed to the Minister    X/Housing and Construction) that an increase in the lending rate to10 per cent - or to any likely level - would not significantlyreduce the effective demand for housing;  and his 2 BSA colleagues had agreed with him.   They pointed out that borrowers who failedto get building society mortgages were often willing to pay higher rates of interest on other kinds of loans.    They said that mostholders of existing mortgages could meet the increased rate by extending the period of their repayments.    When asked whetherthey would be willing to extend further the special arrangements that they made for first-time borrowers, they said they were willing to consider this but pointed out that most first-timeborrowers were purchasers of old houses, so that this measure would not directly affect the market for new houses.    They wouldalso be prepared to discuss a possible stabilisation scheme.    Hehad left them in no doubt of the serious view that the Governmentwould take of a rise in the loan rate to 10 per cent or of the demand that this would create for Government control of building societylending rates.    After consulting the Prime Minister he had net the  representatives of the BSA again and had agreed with them thatin return for a bridging grant of some  5 million a month theywould maintain their loan rate for 3 months at 9i per cent whileincreasing their borrowing rate from 6. 3 per cent to 6. 75 per cent.In his public statement he had made clear that this measure was intended to deal with the immediate short-term situation and thatthe subsidy would in no circumstances be continued after the endof the 3 months.    The Secretary of State for the Environment wasto make a statement that afternoon in the House of Commons, andhe hoped that it would make it clear that the expenditure would be wholly offset by savings in this year&apos;s expenditure on votes for9
which the Department of the Environment was responsible.    Itwoxild now be necessary to consider what immediate action wasnecessary to derive the maximum benefit from the 3 months&apos;grace which had been secured.    For the long term, there mightbe a case for a full scale enquiry into the role of the building societies in order to determine, for instance, whether theGovernment should take permanent powers to control them in anyway.    The form of such an enquiry would require careful thought;while an independent public enquiry might help to reassure thepublic, it might lead to proposals for Government expenditure which could be difficult to resist.In discussion it was argued that the building societies, like theinsurance market, posed a particular problem because they were left outside the controls imposed under the Governmenfscounter-inflation policy;  and one short-term possibility might beto bring them under such control.    It was suggested that in his parliamentary statement the Secretary of State for the environment should place the matter in its context of the counter-inflationary policy.    The Government had an interest in keepingdown the rates not only because of their inflationary effects butalso because the Government had some responsibility for theprotection of existing borrowers who had been encouraged by government policies to become the owners of their houses.    Thebuilding societies must be made aware of the social consequences of their actions.    By valuing houses on a market basis, which made allowance for inflationary expectations, the building societies themselves were contributing to the inflationary spiraland it would be worth discussing with them whether, in spite ofthe obvious difficulties, they could agree to adopt a stable basisof valuation.    But whichever kind of action might be underconsideration, it would be important to avoid the kind of public statements that could cause panic withdrawals by depositors.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe building societies&apos; handling of the present situation, andparticularly the fact that the action of two societies in prematurelyraising their rates had forced the others to follow, gavejustifiable cause for dissatisfaction.    In his statement in theHouse of Commons the Secretary of State for the Environmentshould avoid any suggestion of complacency on the part of theGovernment.    There was no need to defend the actions of thebuilding societies or to make light of their effects.    H3 shouldmake it clear that the Government grant would be found bysavings on other items in his Departments votes for this year.He might say in response to enquiries that the Government wouldengage in further discussion with the building societies about anumber of matters; but he should not at this stage either promise10
or rule out an enquiry of the sort suggested by the Chancellor.It would be desirable to establish a small group of ministers under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer toconsider future policy towards the building societies.   For the short term, they should consider what immediate steps could betaken to ensure that, on the expiry of the bridging grrnt, thekind of problems with which the Government had just been faceddid not at once recur;  and in this context it might be appropriate to consider amendment of the Counter-Inflation Act so as tobring the building societies under statutory control.    Longer-term measures should also be examined, and in this connectionthought should be given to the need for, and possible form of, an enquiry into the functions of the building societies and the irrelations with Government.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.      Invited the Secretary of State for the environment to be guided by it in his statement to Parliament that afternoon.3.       Took note that a group of Ministers underthe chairmanship of the Chancellor of the exchequer would give further thought to future policy towardsthe building societies.11
8. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of housing policyand had before them draft White Papers circulated by theSecretary of State for the Environment (CP(73) 50) and theSecretary of State for Scotland (CP(73) 51).In discussion, it was argued that decisions on the proposals toincrease the output of new houses, especially through the medium of the Voluntary Housing Movement, should be temporarily deferred.The proposals involved considerable public expenditure, and thoughit was envisaged that this would be found by counter-balancingreductions in expenditure on certain other programmes of theDepartment of the Environment, the effect would be to pre-emptone of the main possibilities for reconstituting the contingency reserve.    The benefits of the proposals were at best doubtful andin any event would not be secured for some considerable timejand it would therefore be wiser to postpone an/ decision until thematter could be considered in conjunction with any proposals^which the Chancellor of the Exchequer put forward in relation topubHc expenditure generally.    Only on this basis would it bepossible for the Cabinet to determine a rational order of priorities.The need for an immediate decision was much less now that theproblem of mortgage finance had been dealt with;  moreover, thepolitical benefit to be gained by the immediate issue of the white papers might not be very great, given the general terms in whichthe proposals had to be expressed and the time which would elapse before any substantial results could be achieved.    On the otherhand, it was argued that on social and political grounds it was rightto give the highest priority to housing, on which government supporters were already expressing uneasiness at what they regardedas the lack of satisfactory progress.    There was little doubt thatthe Voluntary Housing Movement had an important part to play, inview particularly of the need to provide for a much bigger pool ofrented housing in the private sector.    Early publication of theWhite Papers was therefore desirable.    It did not however follow that the Government need commit themselves at this stage to anyparticular level of additional future expenditure.    Decisions on this could be taken later in the light of the progress being made *srlth thehousing programme and of the measures found necessary for there constitution of the Contingency Reserve.    On this basis, nofigures of likely expenditure (nor therefore of counter-balancingsavings on other programmes) need be mentioned in the white papers.In relation to the land hoarding charge, it was recalled that at themeeting of the Cabinet on 2 April it had been suggested that there might be advantage in basing the amount of charge payable on acurrent valuation of the land rather than on its value at the timewhen planning permission was granted.    There were in fact great12
practical objections to relating the charge to anything other thanthe value of the land when planning permission was given;   and ifit were thought that this might result in the amount of the penaltybeing inadequate the preferable course would be to increase therate of charge from the proposed 20 per cent to 30 per cent or40 per cent.    A further modification of a transitional i^nature wasalso needed in relation to the land hoarding charge.    At the start of the scheme there would be some owners of land on which planning permission had been secured without their consent.It would be right to give them the opportunity of establishing thatthey had reasonable grounds for not developing the land; and ifthey were able to do this, the planning permission should be revoked without the need for any payment of compensation.    both these points would call for some minor amendment of the draft white Papers.In further discussion the following points were made -a. It would be necessary in the light of the Cabinet1 searlier discussion about mortgage finance for the relevantpassages in the White Papers to be revised.    certain other minor consequential amendments would be needed.b. It would be desirable for some expansion to bemade in the passages dealing with accommodation for the elderly and sheltered housing.    In this context some reference might also be made to dealing with the problemof under-occupation of existing houses.c. It would be useful if the pasisagsa oa. the part to be played by housing associations could be qualified so as tobring out the distinction between new building and theimprovement or conversion of existing houses.d. It might be helpful in any explanatory materialproduced for the Press to indicate that consideration was being given to the problem of office developmentgenerally and unoccupied offices in particular; and alsoto give some practical examples of the effect of the landhoarding charge.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the White Papers should be issued on9 April but that no decision need be taken at this stage as to theadditional expenditure involved.    No figures should therefore be mentioned in the White Papers.    The Cabinet would return to this aspect when they considered the action necessary to reconstitutethe Contingency Reserve.    As regards the land hoarding charge,13
the Cabinet agreed that the White Papers should be amended so asto allow for a higher rate of charge than the 20 per cent originally-proposed, though it might not be necessary at this stage to announce specifically what the figure would be.    It would also benecessary to make the change in the transitional provisions whichhad been mentioned in the course of discussion.    Certain otherdesirable amendments had been referred to and the Secretaries ofState for the Environment and for Scotland in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, should agree on appropriate changesin wording.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Home Secretary, in consultationwith the Secretaries of State for the environment and for Scotland and as necessary with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for social services and other Ministers concerned, to arrangefor the revision of the draft White Papers on the lines indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up.3.      Invited the Secretaries of State for the environment and for Scotland, in consultation withthe Home Secretary and the Lord President of theCouncil, to arrange for the publication of theWhite Papers on 9 April.14
LEGISLATIVEPROGRAMME1973-74SESSIONX9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP(73) 42) on the legislative progiarnmefor the 1973-74 Session.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that the Ministerial Committee on future Legislation recommended the programme set out in annex A to his memorandum. In preparing that programme they hadbeen guided by the consideration that it should comprise measureswhich were poHtically attractive and which would command thegeneral approval of Government supporters and not make whollyUnwarranted demands on their time.    The programme was not infact as attractive as he would have liked; he accordingly urgedhis colleagues to give particular thought between now and the endof the year to the development of policies which might be incorporated in short and attractive measures for the 1974-75Session;  and he suggested that the Central Policy Review Staffmight be invited to draw up proposals for consideration by ministers in this respect.    While the programme as now recommended for the 1973-74 Session would not make unduly-heavy demands on legislative resources, it did not incorporateany allowance for measures which would probably be needed, forexample, on Northern Ireland, on Nationality and on discrimination against Women.    In the light of the opposition which had been maintained by a small number of Members to the Solicitors(Amendment) Bill which had been introduced by a private member in the current Session, he now recommended that themeasure should be included in the Main Programme next Session.He proposed to settle with the Ministers concerned the precisecontent of certain of the Bills included in the programme.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the Cabinet approved the legislative programme set out in annex A to CP(73) 42, subject to the addition, of the Solicitors(Amendment) Bill to the Main Programme and to the lord presidents agreeing with the Ministers concerned the precisecontent of certain of the Bills.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2.      Agreed that the Central Policy Review staff should prepare, and bring forward for consideration,a programme of proposals from which suitablemeasures might be selected for inclusion in thelegislative programme for the 1974-75 Session.
4-RELOCATION OFDEFENCEFACILITIESFROMSHOEBURYNESSPreviousReference:CM(72) 56thConclusions,Minute 610.        The Cabinet resumed their consideration of therelocation of defence facilities from Shoeburyness.    Theyhad before them memoranda by the Secretaries of State forthe Home Department (CP(73) 47) and for Defence (CP(73) 49).THE HOME SECRETARY said that since the Cabinetsprevious discussion on 7 December the Ministry of defence had made a further exhaustive review of sites in the UnitedKingdom and overseas which might accommodate the facilitiesdue to be removed from Shoeburyness to Tain;  and the resultshad been considered successively by the Ministerial Committeeon Regional Policy and the Environment and the Defence and oversea Policy Committee.    These discussions had established that the facilities in question must be reprovided,and that apart from Tain the choice lay between four ranges:castle martin, Lulworth, Pembrey and West Freugh.    In eachcase there were substantial difficulties.    To go to Castlemartinwould mean displacing the Royal Armoured Corps and theFederal German Army, who used the range for tank training,and the cost might be as much as  72 million.    Lulworth had some advantages:  the present use of the range would be diminished, and extra jobs provided in an area where unemploy-ment was relatively high.    But the release of Lulworth from military tenure was the subject of a long standing campaign;it was the principal recommendation of Lord Nugent&apos;sCommittee on Defence Lands;  and to send to Lulworth thefacilities displaced from Shoeburyness would provoke anenvironmental storm.    On military and financial grounds,Pembrey was the most attractive site.   But the Governmentspredecessors in office had referred to public inquiry an earlierproposal to move all the Shoreburyness facilities there;  greathostility had been aroused, and the Secretary of State for Waleshad been obliged to reject the proposal.    To revive it, even ina modified form, might well provoke militant opposition.His colleagues were aware from their former discussions ofthe problem at Tain.    The proposal had been heavily opposedlocally on environmental grounds; but there were widerdifficulties which m?ght substantially threaten the governments position in the North of Scotland.    The military penalties involvedin the use of West Freugh had been set out by the Secretary ofState for Defence in his memorandum.    In particular, thisrange was used in the development of the Multi-Role combat aircraft, on which we were collaborating with the West Germanand Italian Governments, and to combine the existing air taskswith the work of the Proof and Experimental Establishmentwould severely hamper both,16
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that if theMaplin Airport was to proceed, a new home must be found forthe defence facilities from Shoeburyness; but he could not accept the use of sites which did not satisfy essential defence requirements.    He fully appreciated the political difficulties over the use of Tain;   but on military and environmentalgrounds it was the logical choice.    He had asked Lord Nugent&apos;sCommittee to consider this matter.    The standing of thisCommittee, which included two Scottish members, shouldcommand public acceptance, and its report would in some respects reflect the independent judgment with which its members had approached their task; but on this particular question, their choice of Tain was unanimous.    TheGovernment would no doubt wish to pay regard to the Committee&apos;views.    He proposed therefore that their report, which hewould receive at the end of April, should be published withoutcomment by the Government.    If its recommendation infavour of Tain did not provoke great opposition the Governmentwould be able to accept it without more ado; if however itprovoked widespread and sustained opposition, the government might wish to arrange for a further independent assessment ofall the arguments in relation to the five sites under discussion(it would be desirable not to range further afield).    This taskmight be undertaken by a body consisting of an independent chairman advised by members qualified to assess the militaryand environmental factors involved; and their independent status would fortify the Governments decision.In discussion it was suggested that other sites could be madeavailable in Wester Ross if only the technical requirements ofthe Ministry of Defence could be relaxed.    Scottish opinion,which would in any case be disposed to resent a proposal which appeared to sacrifice the interests of Scotland to those ofLondon and the South East, would find it hard to comprehendwhy sites which had been offered by the local planning authority must be rejected in favour of one to which it was opposed.    The Government should not under-estimate the hostility with which such a proposal would be received inScotland, nor the benefit which the Governments political opponents might draw from it.    It was, however, pointed outthat detailed examination had shown all these new sites to suffer from substantial disadvantages on social, environmentalor economic as well as military grounds.    Meanwhile, the needfor a decision, which had now been canvassed for over two years,was growing acute;  the Maplin Development Bill was alreadybefore Parliament, and if the timetable for construction of the airport were to be delayed by failure to remove the facilitiesfrom Shoaburyaess in time, in 1980 the Government of the day would face far more serious problems through the congestion ofthe existing London airports, and the consequent effects on the environment of a million or more people around them.
In view therefore of the need to reach a decision on thisquestion without further delay, care must be taken that anyfurther enquiry did not range too widely, provoke needlesscontroversy in the selection of sites to be considered, r*orrepeat the elaborate and time-consuming procedures of theRoskill Commission.    It must indeed be open to questionwhether a body of the kind proposed could adequately determine the military, environmental, financial and political considera-tions involved;  these were essentially the Governmenfsbusiness, and it could be argued that the Nugent Committee&apos;sreport would provide an acceptable basis for decision.    Therewas, furthermore, the risk that any new enquiry mightrecommend Pembrey since it might not have regard to the factors that ruled out this site.    On the other hand, it wassuggested that the normal process of public inquiry at any oneof these sites must be expected to produce a recommendationagainst moving more defence facilities there.    Unless therefore the Government were prepared to announce outright their decision on the site selected, there might be advantage in securing the support of an independent assessment of all fivesites on the lines suggested by the Secretary of State for Defence.THE PRIME MINISTER   summing up the discussion, said thatthe, Cabinet agreed that they should await publication of thereport of the Committee on Defence Lands.    In the light ofpublic reaction to the report, the Government would considerwhether to accept that Committee&apos;s recommendation in favourof relocating the remaining facilities from Shoeburyness atTain, or whether a further independent assessment, on the lines suggested by the Secretary of State for Defence should be made.Meanwhile the Secretary of State and the other ministers concerned should consider the form such an inquiry might take,its composition and possible terms of reference.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.      Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, inconsultation with the Lord Chancellor, the HomeSecretary, the Lord President and the Secretaries ofState for the Environment, for Scotland and for Wales,to give further consideration to his proposal to arrangefor an independent assessment of possible sites for therelocation of the facilities from Shoeburyness planned to go to Tain.3.      Agreed to resume their consideration of thisquestion in the light of the publication of the reportof the Committee on Defence Lands.18
POPULATIONCENSUSPreviousReference:CM(72) 52ndConclusions,Minute 6The Cabinet considered a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Social Services (CP(73) 43) about theproposal for holding a mid-term population census in 1976.They also had before them a memorandum by the Central policy review Staff (CP(73) 44).THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the proposal for a mid-term census of population in1976 had been re-examined by the Statistical Policy Committee.The need for such a census had been strongly supported on thegrounds that it would provide a better statistical basis for a wide range of central and local government activities, andfor the efficient allocation of very large sums of public expend! -ture which depended on an accurate knowledge of populationdistribution.    The Cabinet would however wish to be sure that existing census information was being fully used beforeauthorising expenditure on a new one.    Moreover, no provisionhad been made for the cost of the proposed census, estimatedat  15 million, in the Governmenfs public expenditure plans.The Chancellor of the Exchequer was currently reviewing thepubHc expenditure prospects, in consultation with other ministers, with a view to reconstituting an adequate contingency reserve, and would shortly be reporting the outcome of this review to the Cabinet.    It would be preferable, therefore, to defer a decision on the proposed census until this review hadbeen completed.    In the meantime, further information shouldbe provided about specific instances where central and localgovernment decisions were based on census information and where the quality of decision-taking would be improved if this information was more up-to-date and accurate.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.      Invited the Home Secretary to arrange forfurther information to be provided to the Cabineton the lines indicated by the Prime Minister inhis summing up.Cabinet office April 1973i
