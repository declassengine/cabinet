t-PARLIAMENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the following week.Counter- An understanding had now been reached with the Opposition in the inflation Bill House of Lords as a result of which the Coanter-Inflation Bill wouldcomplete all its stages in that House by 19 March,previous reference:CM(73) 12thConclusions,Minute 1COUNTER-INFLATIONARYPOLICYBuildingSocieties:InterestCharge onMortgages2. The Cabinet were informed that there was considerable public and Parliamentary concern about the proposal by the building societies to increase to 9 per cent the rate of interest charged to borrowers.    It was understood that they contemplated a further increase to 9i per cent shortly thereafter; and there appeared to be some pressure for the rate to be fixed at the higher figure at once.Such action was clearly premature and unjustified, particularlybecause the measures to encourage personal savings which hadbeen announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his budget statement would not have an immediate effect on the volume of fundsdeposited with Building Societies by investors.    In thesecircumstances an increase in the rate of interest charged by the Societies, by inflating house prices, would be damaging to the Governments counter-inflationary policies.    It would therefore be desirable that the Secretary of State for the environment and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should urge the building societies forthwith to refrain from making any immediate increasein the rate of interest charged to borrowers.    If, however, theycould not be wholly dissuaded, they should be very strongly advised to ensure that the new rate would not exceed 9 per cent.The cabinet invited the Secretary of State for the environment and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to proceed accordingly.1
-NATIONALHEALTHSERVICEREORGANISATIONBILLPreviousReference:CM(72) 59thConclusions,Minute 1Family-PlanningServices3. THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Home and social affairs Committee had recently considered the attitude to beadopted by the Government in the House of Commons duringthe debate on the Second Reading of the National Health ServiceReorganisation Bill in the following week, following the deletionfrom the Bill by the House of Lords of any power to charge for family planning, even by way of the ordinary prescription charge.The result would be to increase expenditure by about  16 million a year after some four years, in addition to the extra  17 million a year for improved family planning services which the Secretaryof State for Social Services had announced in December of theprevious year.    The annual figure of  16 million would be reducedto  13 million if ordinary prescription charges were imposed insteadof the special charges envisaged in the Bill as originally introduced.The Home and Social Affairs Committee had considered that on meritsa further extension of the service did not command high priority.But the present climate of opinion amongst Government supporters -as evidenced by the well-supported Early Day Motion, urging theprovision of comprehensive family planning and birth control service as a normal part of the National Health Service - was such that it was unlikely that the Government would be able to secure the reinstate-ment of the charging powers deleted by the House of Lords.    Inthese circumstances, the Committee had concluded that, while itwould be right (and would probably be acceptable to the government&apos;s supporters) to propose an amendment providing for the levying of ordinary prescription charges, it would be unwise to go further.The Secretary of State for Social Services would indicate in the debate that the additional expenditure would have to be met either by a reduction in expenditure in other areas (which, to the extent that the health services were involved, would imply the abandonmentor postponement of parts of agreed programmes) or by an increasein either National Health Service charges or the Health Serviceelement in the weekly National Insurance contribution.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that, although on merits there was little case for a further expansion of the service, it would on political groundsbe impracticable to seek to reinstate the charging powers deleted bythe House of Lordsv    It was clearly right, however, that family planning should be subject to the prescription charges which appliedto the rest of the National Health Service; and an amendment to thisend should accordingly be tabled.    The Secretary of State for social services should indicate to the House of Commons that, in order tomeet the additional expenditure it would be necessary either to restrict other programmes in the health field or elsewhere or toincrease either prescription charges or the Health Service element in the weekly National Insurance contribution.    He should discuss with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, which of these methods was preferable and should submit proposals to the Cabinet in due course.
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretaryof State for Social Services and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, to proceed accordingly.3
4. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat there was a meeting of the Council of Ministers (Finance) of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) in Brussels that day, whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer was attending, in order to discussthe policy which the e.c. should adopt in the present internationalcurrency crisis.    There was to be a further meeting on Sunday11 March,At the meeting of the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on March there had been a general discussion of the series of agreements which it was proposed that the e.c. should concludewith countries bordering on the Mediterranean.    These agreements were of significance for the eec&apos;s external relations generally.    Ifreverse tariff preferences were required from the countries concerned, this would cause offence to the United States and could adversely affect the prospects for the multilateral trade negotiations which were to be begun later in the year.    Theagricultural provisions of the agreements would also haveimplications for the eec&apos;s relations both with the developing countries already associated with the Community and with thoseCommonwealth countries which might seek Association.    Moreover,a premature decision to give particular aid to the Mediterraneancountries could prejudice the comprehensive aid policy, based onconcentrating help where it was most needed, which we wished tosee the e.c. adopt.    It was therefore important that the series ofMediterranean agreements should accord with the external policywhich we hoped that the enlarged e.c. would develop rather thansimply reflect the traditional relationships of the former community of Six.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had accordingly proposed that the e.c. Commission should draw up proposals whichmight form the basis of an appropriate e.c. offer to each of theMediterranean countries.The Commission were also to produce by the middle of April adraft mandate which would form the basis for the Community^negotiating position in the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations.    This document would need to take account ofthe critical importance of the United States in these negotiations and to reflect recent exchanges between e.c. Ministers and theUnited States Administration, including the Prime Minister&apos;discussions with President Nixon at the beginning of February,The timetable proposed for agreeing and announcing EECagricultural prices for 1973-74 was relevant to the Governmentscounter-inflationary policy.    It was intended that the e.c. commission should put forward proposals for these prices on 22 March that theyshould be considered by the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on26-27 March and on 16-17 April and that they should be announced on 18 April,

-NORTHERN 5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDIRELAND said that several members of the Provisional Irish Republican army had been arrested in the course of the past week;  and some armshad been recovered.    But there were grounds for concern aboutthe continuing loss of arms held by members of the Ulster DefenceRegiment, who appeared to put up little resistance when confrontedby terrorists.    A draft Order in Council amending the FirearmsAct (Northern Ireland) 1969 and imposing more stringent controls on the possession of licensed weapons would shortly be made;  andfurther efforts were in train to persuade registered arms dealersto place their stocks of weapons voluntarily in the hands of thepolice.The Border Poll which was taking place that day would probablybe the occasion for some violence; but the security forces were making a maximum effort to contain it.    The result of the Pollshould be available on 9 March.THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that he would beopening discussions that afternoon with Mr Cosgrave, the leader of the Fine Gael Party in the Irish Republic, who was succeedingMr Lynch as Prime Minister,    Mr Cosgrave would be accompaniedby Mr Corish, the Leader of the Irish Labour Party, who was to beDeputy Prime Minister in the new Coalition Government,    He hoped,in the course of these discussions, to engage in a general review of irish questions of common concern to the two Governments and toobtain a reaction to the proposals which would shortly be appearing in our White Paper on constitutional reform in Northern Ireland,The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Prime Ministerand the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
INDUSTRIAL 6, THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY said that, at the meeting ofAFFAIRS the National Joint Industrial Council for the gas industry on the--- previous afternoon, which had been convened to discuss the threatThe Gas by the gas unions to cut off town gas supplies to domestic consumersIndustry unless the British Gas Corporation (BGC) agreed to start cutting offnatural gas supplies to industrial consumers, the BGC had putPrevious forward proposals which were intended to resolve the dispute.Reference: The BGC had not changed the terms of the offer of increased pay;CM(73) 14th but they had proposed that there should be no compulsory redundancyConclusions, in the gas industry before 1 October 1973. that there should be minute 1 negotiations about a new pay structure in the industry and thatthere should be improvements in the pensions arrangements,including a revaluation of the pensions fund and an adjustment of the level of contributions.    He had been assured by the Chairmanof the BGC that there was nothing in these proposals which was contrary to the Pay Code or would bring the total cost above thatpermitted by the pay limit.    The union leaders themselves hadreacted favourably to the proposals and now proposed to submitthem, albeit without endorsement, to a delegate conference of theGeneral and Municipal Workers&apos; Union (GMWU) on the following day,after seeking the support of the union!s representatives in the regions.If the delegate conference supported the proposals, they would befurther considered by the GMWU Executive Committee on the following monday,    The union leaders had agreed that they would instruct their members that there should be no increase in the scale ofindustrial action in the meantime; and they understood thatimplementation of the BGCs offer was conditional upon the ending of all industrial action.    If the offer was rejected, a rapid escalation of industrial action could be expected.    TheChairman of the BGC had asked that his earlier request that the Government should take Emergency Powers should be heldin abeyance until the outcome of the unions1 consideration of theoffer was known.BritishRailwaysBoardPreviousReference:CM(73) 14thConclusions,Minute 1THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES said that thesituation on the railways caused by the industrial action beingtaken by the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and firemen (ASLEF) was now serious.    Widespread action, whichhad clearly been deliberately planned and was more extensive thanin the previous year&apos;s dispute, had been taken on the previous day by drivers employed in the Southern Region without any advancenotice.    There would be insufficient time between the national strike by ASLEF on that day and the further national strike tobe held on the following Sunday to enable the British railways board (BRB) management to secure a resumption of normal workingthroughout the system;  and by the following Monday there would be
KBa substantial accumulation of delayed freight traffic and, probably,widespread disorganisation of rail services generally.    Only 50 percent of the normal amount of oil traffic had been carried on theprevious day; and coal stocks would start to accumulate at pitheadsby the following day.    The difficulties were being exacerbated by ashortage of empty coal wagons and of steel wagons.    The Chairmanof BRB was anxious to avoid any action which would be liable toaggravate the situation.    But the behaviour of ASLEF officials,who were encouraging their members to increase the level of their non-co-operation at a time when discussions were taking place between the BRB and the unions, was working in the opposite direction.    The Metropolitan Police were making their customaryarrangements to facilitate the movement and parking of vehicles inLondon,NationalHealthServiceAncillaryWorkersPreviousReference:CM(73) 14thConclusions,Minute 1THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the impact of the industrial action by the National Health Service (NHS)ancillary workers continued to vary from place to place.    Thedifficulties in hospital laundries were being overcome by a variety of measures, including the use of disposable linen,    The leadersof the unions concerned were clearly searching for some means of bringing the industrial action to an end and were trying, with mixedsuccess, to fulfil their undertaking to keep essential services in hospitals in operation.    The unions appeared unwilling themselvesto put their case to the Pay Board, on the grounds that this would bein breach of the- resolutions adopted by the Special Congress of theTrades Union Congress (TUC) earlier that week.    But they seemedwilling to co-operate If a reference to the Pay Board were made bythe Management Side.    In these circumstances the Governmentwould be wise to continue to avoid showing undue concern aboutthe situation and to allow the pressures of adverse publicity tohave their effect on the unions.    It had proved possible so far to avoid informing the NHS electricians that their pay settlement would have to conform to the pay limit.The CoalIndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 12thConclusions,Minute 4THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY said that, although the national coal Board&apos;s (NCB) negotiators had maintained a firm attitude inthe face of pressure from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM)that miners should be granted an extra week&apos;s holiday, the Chairmanof the NCB had disclosed publicly that he would have been willing tomake this concession if he had been free to do so.    Even soe the NUMmight not decide to take industrial action when the ExecutiveCommittee next met on 16 March, since they would be entitledto a substantial pay increase within the pay limit and would notbe anxious to jeopardise the new redundancy arrangements,,
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthere appeared to be a growing risk that industrial action among the manual workers in the water industry would spread after the nextnegotiating meeting to be held on 14 March.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL reported on industrial action in the CivilService,    His report is recorded separately.In discussion the following main points were made -a. The intensification of industrial action by membersof ASLEF and the attitude of the union leaders representingNHS ancillary workers demonstrated the adverse effect whichthe resolutions adopted at the TUC Special Congress wouldhave on industrial relations generally.    Union leaders would now be bound to find it harder to resist pressure frommilitant elements.    The wording of the resolutions was so imprecise that it was possible to claim that unions should refuse to avail themselves of the services of the Pay Board.b. The fact that there were no longer strikes at the FordMotor Company^ works demonstrated the wisdom of adopting a firm attitude in the face of pressure by militants, whomconcessions would be unlikely to influence in any way.c. There was increasing criticism among theGovernments supporters about the apparent unwillingnesson the part of the authorities to make use of the large numberof members of the public who had volunteered to help in hospitals.    It was far from clear that the ancillary workers were engaged in tasks which volunteers would be unable to perform.    On the other hand there was a serious risk that,if volunteers were used, the unions would withdraw their undertaking to keep a minimum of essential services inoperation.
d. The arbitration award to the NUM had been confined to the narrow point that the five rest days granted under theWilberforce settlement did not constitute a third week&apos;s holiday.It had not been concerned with the separate issue whather theminers were entitled to three weeks&apos; holiday,e. Continued efforts should be made to ensure that the publicity for industrial disputes was presented by the mediawithout bias,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the question of the need for Emergency powers in relation to the dispute in the gas industry should be held in abeyance until the outcome of the GMWU delegate conference onthe following day was known.    The Secretary of State for employment should seek from the General Secretary of the TUC clarification of thequestion whether the resolutions passed by the TUC Special Congressearlier that week were intended to preclude any approach by theunions to the Pay Board.    The Lord Privy Seal should arrangefor the Civil Contingencies Unit to give further consideration tothe possibility of using volunteer workers to replace NHS ancillary workers, particularly in hospital laundries.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.2. Invited the Secretary of State for employment to consult the General Secretary of the Trades UnionCongress about the meaning of the resolutions passedby its Special Congress, as indicated in the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.3. Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for theCivil Contingencies Unit to consider further the use of volunteers in hospitals.
reorganisation of THENUCLEARDESIGN ANDCONSTRUCTIONINDUSTRYPreviousReference:CM(73) 8thConclusions,Minute 37. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry (CP(73) 22) about the reorganisation ofthe nuclear design and construction industry.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY saidthat at their previous discussion on 19 February the Cabinet had considered his proposal that the industry should be reorganisedby the creation of a new company, in which the General ElectricCompany (G.C) would have the leading role, in replacement ofthe two existing consortia.    The main points on which concernhad been expressed were the extent of the Governments controlover the new company, the manner in which this control shouldbe exercised and the role which the company would play in nuclearresearch and development.    As regards the first of these issues itwas clearly essential that the Government should control the strategyof civil nuclear policy, including the critical decisions on suchmatters as the choice of reactors, the broad lines of research anddevelopment and the rights to the technology of the Atomic energy authority (sea).    G.C must be given clear responsibility, however,for management and marketing.    The Governments control would be supported by advice from the proposed Nuclear Power advisory board; but they should also reserve special rights over the new company&apos;s policies on purchasing, the formation of overseas links,issues relating to research and development affecting the sea,alteration in share capital and (if the company were not to be a subsidiary of G.C) ultimate control of the management.Alternative proposals for the structure of the new company were set out in CP(73) 22.    There was a choice between giving G.C amajority shareholding or a minority shareholding coupled wiih a management contract.    It would be important to strike the rightbalance between protecting the public interest and ensuring thatGEC would be fully committed to the new venture.    There were strong arguments for giving G.C a majority holding in the company,subject to the proposed safeguards; but it would be possible to explore with them an alternative arrangement under which theywould have a minority stake in the undertaking.     As regardsresearch and development the new company must play a major part, in view of the lack of commercial orientation which charac-terised the existing structure.    For this purpose it should be a function of the company to formulate proposals for the Governmentto consider on the basis of advice from the Nuclear Power advisory board.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the sea accepted theneed for strengthening and reorganising the design and construction industry.    They were mainly concerned that the position of themembers of the two existing design and construction consortia
should be adequately safeguarded;  and this condition appeared to besatisfied by the proposals in CP(73) 22.    Sir Arnold Weinstock, the managing Director of G.C, had confirmed that G.C were now prepared to be accommodating on such issues as the size of theirshareholding in the new company; that they would concentrate adequatefinancial and management resources on the nuclear design and construction industry; and that they would give it preference over their interests in other enterprises.    They would also be willingto collaborate fully with the sea in research and development, towhich they themselves were already devoting substantial resources.They recognised that the choice of nuclear systems would be a matter for final decision by the Government, in the light of advice from the nuclear Power Advisory Board,    Sir Arnold Weinstock had maintained that, until the 3ritish steam generating heavy water reactor (SGHWR)had been proven in commercial use, its export prospects could notcompare with those of the light water reactors developed in theUnited States, in spite of the doubts entertained about the latterfssafety.    This issue, however, could not be resolved until the SGHWRhad been brought into use.    Sir Arnold also recognised that the fastbreeder reactor offered the best prospects for the longer-termfuture;  and G.C would pursue the development of this systemvigorously.In further discussion it was suggested that it might be desirableto explore the possibility of limiting the G.C stake to a minorityholding, coupled with a management contract.    The Cabinet could then take a final decision between this and the alternative approach,involving a G.C majority holding, when they knew in more detail theterms and conditions involved on each of the two hypotheses.    Itwould be important to avoid exposing the Government to political criticism that their proposals would be unduly favourable to G.C,even though an arrangement involving a management contract could also be politically controversial in terms of the level of themanagement fee.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Trade and industry should now open negotiations with G.C and the other parties concerned in order to promote a reorganisation of the nucleardesign and construction industry on the basis of a private sectorcompany led by G.C.    These negotiations should include anexploration of the possibility of limiting the G.C stake to a minorityholding, as suggested in paragraph 5 of CP(73) 15.    The cabinet would take a final decision on the structure of the company in thelight of the outcome of the exchanges with GECt
tThe Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister,2*        Invited the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry, in consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Defence and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, to initiate negotiations on the lines indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing upof their discussion and to report the outcome tothe Cabinet as soon as possible.REMUNERATION     8, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofOF State for the Home Department (CP(73) 29) about the remunerationSCOTTISH of members of regional councils in Scotland.COUNCILLORSTHE HOME SECRETARY said that the Ministerial Committee on regional Policy and the Environment had considered on 21 Februarya proposal that regional councillors in Scotland should be remuneratedby way of a salary rather than attendance allowances.    The RoyalCommission on Local Government in Scotland had unanimouslyrecommended that salaries should be paid to all councillors.Proceedings on the Local Government (Scotland) Bill had shown a strong degree of support for this view from Scottish Membersof Parliament, including some of the Governments supporters;and it seemed likely that, either in the Scottish Standing committee or in t1&apos;e House of Lords, amendments to provide salaries at least for regional councillors would be carried against the Government.On the other hand when local government in England and Wales wasreorganised, the Government had maintained that, in principle,service on a local authority should be voluntary and not salaried;and several members of the Committee had felt strongly that to concede the principle of salaried service even for regional councillorswould establish an unfortunate precedent, which would lead by degreesto a fundamental change in the character of local government.    Butopinion in the Committee had been divided;  and in view of thepolitical importance of the question at issue, it had been necessaryto refer it to the Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that, althoughat the time when the policy for England and Wales was under reviewlittle support had been evinced in Scotland for the concept that localgovernment service should be salaried, there would now be sustainedpressure from Scottish Members of all Parties in its favour.    to resist it would stimulate nationalist sentiment and forfeit much of
the goodwill which the Government had so far acquired by the mannerin which they had dealt with the Local Government (Scotland) Bill.The Royal Commission had been partly influenced in the irrecommendation by the size of the Scottish regions and the consequent demands which would be made on regional councillors;and there were good grounds for distinguishing them in this respectfrom district councillors or members of the new English and Welshauthorities.    Moreover, the proposed change need not cost more thana system of attendance allowances, since it would be realistic to fix the level of salaries by reference to the cost of attendance allowances for a normal number of meetings.    There was already a tendencyamong members of local authorities in Scotland to proliferate meetings in order to qualify for higher allowances;  and the payment of salariesshould therefore encourage efficiency and, possibly, even save moneyaIn discussion there was a wide measure of support for the view thatthe proposal to pay salaries to councillors would set an undesirableprecedent in a field which had traditionally been regarded as appropriate for voluntary service.    Even the differentiation between regional and district councillors in Scotland might, overtime, prove difficult to sustain;  and outside Scotland pressure would develop for salaries to be paid in respect of service notonly on local authorities but on the magistracy, health authoritiesand other public bodies as well.    Such a change might well be^ unwelcome to the general body of ratepayers;  and it would bejh uncharacteristic of a Conservative Administration to promotesuch a wholesale erosion of the principle of voluntary service.Moreover, the Royal Commission had addressed themselves onlyto the situation in Scotland; but it was doubtful whether the demands on regional councillors would be significantly heavier than, forexample, those on members of the Greater London Council orthe new metropolitan boroughs.    The present system of allowances in Scotland, which was based on claims for individual expenses,might be widely abused; but attendance allowances on the patternnow proposed would enable members of local authorities to receivereasonable recompense for the duties which they actually discharged,whereas a salary would provide no incentive to efficiency and wouldbe open to abuse of a rather different kind.    At present many members of local authorities did not claim allowances; andsalaried service at a comparable rate would be bound to be more expensive.    If the practice were to extend to local authorities inEngland and Wales, the total cost might be of the order of  7.0 million a year;  and its introduction in present circumstances might give riseto criticism in the context of the Governments counter-inflationarypolicies.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet, while recognising the difficulties which the Secretary ofState for Scotland faced in Parliament, considered that the proposalto pay salaries to councillors in Scotland was undesirable inprinciple and would create an unfortunate precedent for otherparts of the United Kingdom,    For this reason they could not accept the argument that, if Scottish Members were to vote infavour of such a proposal it would be inappropriate for theGovernment to rely on the votes of English and Welsh members to restore the position.    In the light of the Cabinet:s decision,the Secretary of State should now consult the Lord President,the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip about the most appropriate means of dealing with the question in Parliament.The Cabinet -Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland, inconsultation with the Lord President of the Council^the Lord Privy Seal and the Parliamentary Secretary,Treasury, to ensure that the Local Government(Scotland) Bill was not amended to provide for thepayment of salaries to councillors.15
9. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said thatthose within the Scottish Trades Union Congress who sympathisedwith the Clydebank local authority had made it clear that they were unwilling to pay any further fine imposed by the Court of Session asa result of Clydebankls failure to comply with the interim Order for specific performance made by the Court; and in these circumstances the Clydebank authority were no longer refusing to implement theHousing Finance Act.    Three of the four minor local authoritiesstill in default had also capitulated;  and the revolt by Scottish localauthorities against the Act was now virtually at an end.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement by theSecretary of State for Scotland.Cabinet Office8 March, 1973

The Commissioners of customs and Excise proposed to adopt a robust attitude towards the strikers but would take no action until the Civil Service department had carried out an urgent review of the situation throughout theService,    There were reports that other strikes by CPSA members would take place during the following week at a number of locations,including the St Stephenls Press, some offices of the Department ofHealth and Social Security and the Department of the environment and at premises occupied by computers used by the Department ofNational Savings and the Ministry of Defence.    He hoped very shortly to be in a position to consult the Ministers most closely concerned about the action which would need to be taken.    The attitude in other unions appeared to be less militant than that in the CPSA.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Lord Privy Seal.Cabinet Office9 March 1973
