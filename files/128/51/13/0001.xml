C ounte r * InflationBillPreviousReference:CM(73) 9thConclusions,Minute 1An understanding had been reached with the Opposition in the Houseof Lords which would ensure that the Counter-Inflation Bill wouldcomplete all its stages in that House by 22 March;  and there wasa fair prospect that this date could in practice be advanced to20 March,    But any opportunity of securing even earliercompletion should be taken, since it was essential that the Billshould reach the Statute Book as rapidly as possible.m -PARLIAMENTARY   1, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons during the following week,
2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH secretary said that he would probably visit Paris on the following day inorder to take part in the final session of the international conference on Vietnam.    The proposal by the Canadian Governmentthat there should be a permanent body to which the international control Commission should report had not been accepted;  norhad the Conference been able to agree that the Secretary Generalof the United Nations, Dr. Waldheim, should be given thisrole.    It would probably be decided, therefore, that theInternational Control Commission should report to those who had attended the Conference, separately and individually, among whomthe Secretary General was included.    Meanwhile, the situationin Vietnam itself continued to give cause for concern;  and north vietnamese troops were being moved in considerable numberstowards the South.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.OVERSEAAFFAIRSVietnamPreviousReference:CM(73) 7thConclusions,Minute 2
EUROPEAN 3. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERCOMMUNITY said that no issue of particular significance had arisen at the affairs meeting of the Council of Ministers (Social Affairs) of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) in Brussels on :6 February.    In the coming week, however, three members ofthe e.c. Commission would be visiting London;Signor Scarascia Mugnozza, who was concerned primarily with questions of transport policy; Monsieur Lardinois, who wishedto discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Agriculture the agricultural price problems arisingfrom the recent parity changes;  and Mr George Thomson, theCommissioner responsible for regional policy, who was to prepare a report for the Commission by the middle of March.Two issues which had arisen in the Community were potentiallydifficult from our point of view.    The first was constituted bythe Commission^ proposals about the application of monetarycompensatory amounts to imports of New Zealand butter, which,if implemented, would be to our disadvantage.   The second was concerned with the elt&amp;ag of the European Monetary Co-operationFund, which was to be established on 1 April.    In due course this could become an institution of major importance; and wehad therefore favoured siting it in Brussels.    Substantial supporthad now developed within the Community, however, for locatingit in Luxembourg; but, if it was not to be accommodated in brussels, it might be to our advantage to press for it to be sitedin London.In discussion the following main points were made:-a. The Community&apos;s decision on grants for hill farmerswas welcome;  and future Community policy on beefprices was also likely to be favourable to us.b. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and food proposed to delay announcing the resultsof the United Kingdom annual Farm Price Review untilthe negotiations with the Community on interim price arrangements under Article 54 of the Treaty of Accessionhad been completed.    This process should be completed by the middle of March;  and he had informed the NationalFarmers1 Union accordingly.c. It would be important, as a matter of principle, to.ensure that a reasonable number of major Communityinstitutions were located in the United Kingdom.3
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatit should be borne in mind that the French Government had alwayshoped that the United Kingdom might press for Communityinstitutions to be sited in this country since this would enablethem to revive their proposal that the Political Secretariat shouldbe located in Paris.4
National HealthServiceAncillaryWorkersPreviousReference:CM(73) 11thConclusions,Minute 1First reports of the industrial action by National Health Service(NHS) ancillary workers which had begun that day indicated a potentially more serious situation than had been forecast.    it seemed likely that there would be a major disruption of hospital services and that some hospitals would have to be closed.BritishRailwaysBoardPreviousReference:CM(73) 11thConclusions,Minute 1The executive Committee of the Associated Society of locomotive engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) would be meeting again that day in order to consider the scope for intensifying their industrial action, following their one-day national strike on the previous day.The negotiations immediately before that strike had compelled theBritish Railways Board to cancel the initial negotiating meeting with the three railway unions about the annual pay increase due on1 May,    The Board had now given an assurance, however, that theywould not make any pay offer to ASLEF which, taking account ofboth the proposals on restructuring of drivers1 pay and the annualpay claim, would in total contravene the limit under the Stage pay policy.The Coal The situation in the coal industry would not have been improved by industry the arbitration award to the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM),which ruled that the five rest days granted under the Wilberforcesettlement did not constitute a third weekls holiday.    The NUMwould be disappointed to find that the Pay Code would now requirethis extra week to be counted as part of the pay settlement.tINDUSTRIAL 4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thatAFFAIRS on the previous day the General Council of the Trades Union--- Congress (TUC) had endorsed the recommendation of the FinanceCounter-Inflation      and General Purposes Committee that no resolution should be putPolicy before the delegates at the Special Congress of trade unions on6 March, which would be invited only to endorse the tuc&apos;s planPrevious for countering inflation, &quot;Economic Policy and CollectivePreference: Bargaining in 1973&quot;.CM(73) 11thConclusions,Minute 1
FordsPreviousReference:CM(73) 11thConclusions,Minute 1The decision of the workers at the Dagenham plant of the Ford motor company on the previous day to reject proposals by the convenersfor three-day unofficial strikes constituted a defeat for the militantunofficial National Conveners&apos; Committee.    It might now become possible to avoid a major confrontation at Fordls so long as no action was taken which would enable the militant elements toestablish control.In discussion the following main points were made -a.        It was becoming apparent that the unionsrepresenting the NHS ancillary workers might not beable to ensure local observance of the understandingswhich they had reached with the Health Departments aboutthe continued maintenance of hospital services which were essential to life,    A disruption of hospital laundry services,which were particularly vulnerable to industrial action,could result in a spread of infection which in certaincircumstances could itself constitute a risk to life.Gas IndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 11thConclusions,Minute 1In some areas programmes of action had been devised bythe staffs, which involved action against a number of individual hospitals, or groups of hospitals, in rotation.It had proved possible to use volunteer workers, with unionagreement, in three areas where the ancillary workers had refused to maintain the level of service agreed by the unions.b. The situation in the gas industry appeared to be in danger of deteriorating.    The British Gas Corporation(BGC) were particularly concerned about the possibility that,unless some understanding could be reached with the localunion representatives during the course of that day, towngas supplies in the West Midlands would have to be graduallyshut down over the next few days, first to the remainingindustrial users and subsequently to some domestic users.The Council were still not asking that the Government shouldtake Emergency Powers? but they might be compelled to doso if no agreement was reached with the unions in theWest Midlands.    In these circumstances it might benecessary to recommend the proclamation of a State ofEmergency during the coming weekend.c.        All possible steps should be taken to ensure that thepublic appreciated the issues involved in the dispute affectingthe NHS and continued to support the Government in thedispute in the gas industry.    The maximum of publicity should be given to the Governments attitude in both contexts;but the two cases would need to be treated rather differently.
The NHS ancillary workers were comparatively low-paid and might be the more likely to capture the public sympathy.It would therefore be important to emphasise that they now had only a fortnight to wait before they could receive theirStage 2 pay increase;  and public attention should bedirected to those respects in which they were neverthelessmaintaining their intransigent attitude and were thereforeendangering the safety and comfort of hospital patients.It would also be necessary to make it clear that the health departments were not opposed to the use of volunteerworkers in hospitals provided that the unions had refusedto carry out the duties in question and that life would been dangered if they were not performed.As regards the gas industry it would be desirable that,before a State of Emergency was declared, an appeal shouldbe made to the workers to resume normal working and toallow the Pay Board to consider their case under paragraph 33 of the Stage 2 White Paper (Cmnd 5205),More generally, it would be desirable to counter theimpression, which the numerous reports of industrial action in the Press were creating, that a significantproportion of the country^ work-force was now on strike,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet noted that it might shortly become necessary to recommend the proclamation of a State of Emergency.    Meanwhile, it was essential that there should be no delay in rebutting union propaganda against the Governments pay policy.    The Secretary of State for social Services should take steps forthwith in order to make clear the Governments anxiety about the irresponsible action which someNHS ancillary workers appeared to be prepared to take despite theprospect of a substantial wage increase in the very near future.The Lord President should co-ordinate arrangements for publicityby other Ministers before and during the coming weekend.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister,2.        Invited the Lord President of the Councilto co-ordinate appropriate publicity for theGovernments attitude towards the currentindustrial disputes before and during the comingweekend.
DEFAULTON THEHOUSINGFINANCE ACTSPreviousReference:CM(73) 5thConclusions,Minute 75. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for the Environment (CP(73) 17 and 20) and the Secretaryof State for Wales (CP(73) 18) about the action being taken where local authorities were failing to implement the Housing FinanceActs.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe London Borough of Camden and Conisbrough Urban DistrictCouncil had decided to implement the legislation.    Clay CrossUrban District Council was now the only local authority in Englandwhich remained recalcitrant.    The eleven members of that authority had been surcharged jointly and severally by the District Auditorwith the sum of  6, 985;  and they had now appealed to the HighCourt.    In the meantime they remained members of the authority and were maintaining their irresponsible attitude, as evidenced bytheir recent decision not to pay to the Public Works Loan. Boardinterert, amounting to some  20, 000 which was due to be paid at the end of March.    Comprehensive powers to replace them wouldnot be available unless special legislation were passed;  and, although they might be directed to perform their statutory duties by writ ofmandamus, this would probably be ineffective.    Moreover, if itresulted in their being committed to prison for contempt of Court, hey might become martyrs in the eyes of public opinion.    Itwould be possible to appoint a Housing Commispioner to implement the legislation; but it was open to question whether this would cause the councillors to adopt a more reasonable attitude.    If the HighCourt rejected their appeal, they would become disqualified from membership of a local authority for a period of five years.    Inthat event Derbyshire County Council would be entitled to appointindividuals to act as the council under Section 72(3) of the LocalGovernment Act 1933;  and informal discussions with, a number of leading members of the County Council suggested that the council might be willing to act in that way, although it might be necessaryto arrange for the appointment of a Housing Commissioner toundertake the controversial aspects of housing instead of placingthose functions in the hands of the substitute council.In these circumstances no decision was required pending the outcome of the appeal; but it would clearly be desirable that the hearing should be expedited as much as possible.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that Clydebankwas the only major authority remaining obdurate in Scotland.The opposition of the few minor local authorities was declining;and eventually only one of these might be disposed to continue itsdefiance.    The Clydebank authority had been fined  5, 000 by theCourt of Session as a result of their failure to comply with aninterrm Order for specific performance made by the Court;  and
that fine had been paid by funds provided by extremist politicalsympathisers.    The authority would be likely to incur a larger finewhen they again appeared before the Court in the following week;and a refusal to pay a second fine would result in further Courtproceedings towards the end of the month.    In this situation he was making preparations to take over Clydebank&apos;s housing functions by Order under the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1966,    If some tenantsthen refused to pay their rents, they might be supported by therecalcitrant councillors.    On the other hand, as a result ofassuming the housing functions he would have the opportunity topay the rebates and allowances to which tenants were entitled under the legislation;  and he would ensure that the most effectivepresentation was given to these benefits.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said that the HousingCommissioners in Merthyr Tydfil County Borough and Bedwas andMachen Urban District were encountering only moderate opposition in collecting rents at the new levels.    In Merthyr Tydfil only124 out of the 5, 600 tenants visited up to the previous day had declined to pay the increase;  and the Leader of the Council wasamong those who had paid.    The position in Bedwas and Machenhad changed little since a fortnight ago, by which date 376 tenantsout of 1485 visited had refused to pay.    Rent rebate schemes hadbeen introduced in both areas under the legislation;  and in Bedwasand Machen two of the councillors who had been leading theopposition had applied for, and had been granted, rebates.    Therewere encouraging signs that influential local opinion now wished the two Councils to implement the legislation.    The DistrictAuditor, however, would be.likely at his annual audit in August toimpose a surcharge on the councillors responsible for any loss ofrevenue both in these two areas and in the other areas in which local authorities had delayed the implementation of the legislation.Unless some action was taken to avert such a possibility, thesesurcharges might result in the automatic disqualification of thecouncillors concerned.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that appropriate action should be taken to expedite as much as possiblethe hearing of the appeal by the Clay Cross Urban District Council.Further consideration should also be given to the action whichmight be taken if the Council implemented their decision not to pay tothe Public Works Loan Board the interest due at the end of March,The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for the Environment to be guided accordingly.
6. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the PrimeMinister (GP(73) 13) and the Chief Secretary, Treasury(CP(73) 11 about the Programme Analysis and Review (PAR)proposals for 1973-75.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the proposed programme of PAR studies for 1973 and the two succeeding years was directed towards six strategic themes and comprised 26 newstudies,    This new programme, together with the twelve PARstudies now completed and the thirteen in progress, would havethe result that in its first five years PAR would have beenappHed to about half of all public expenditure.    During the nextfew years unforeseen demands for additional expenditure wouldcertainly arise;  and these could only be met without a whollyunacceptable increase in total public expenditure if adjustmentscould readily be made to existing programmes in accordancewith changing priorities.    The PAR system was of particular value for this purpose.In discussion broad agreement was expressed with the proposed programme of studies.    It was suggested, however, that PARmust not be pressed too far.    It made substantial demands onDepartmental resources which could in s^me instances be betterused for other purposes;  and the subjects for analysis should therefore be chosen with great discrimination.    In particular,PAR should not be used to provide ex post facto   justification for decisions which had already been taken by the responsible ministers on grounds of policy;  nor should it be allowed to delayDepartmental decisions on matters on which urgent action was needed.    On the other hand it was of value in providing ministers with the factual basis of sound decisions;  and this was particularlytrue in the case of certain rather diffuse topics - e. g. urbandeprivation - where responsibilities were ill-defined and therewas a danger that basic objectives would remain unclarified and resources would be used uneconomic ally as the result ofduplication j&amp;rmisdirection of effort.    There were also certain important themes - e. g. the scope for voluntary effort insociety - which did not lend themsleves to separate PAR studiesbut would be illuminated by several of the particular topics inthe programme for 1973-75.    It was important that in theconduct of individual PAR studies the implications of this country&apos;obligations to the European Economic Community (e.c.) shouldnot be overlooked.    These might restrict the range of availablepolicy options as compared with the situation before cur accession to the e.c., when the decisions concerned had been wholly at ourown discretion.   But they might equally afford opportunities for ensuring that the United Kingdom derived from the Community&apos;ssocial and economic programmes assistance which would not otherwise have been available to us and might now offset to someextent our contribution to the Community1 s budget under otherheads.10confidential
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,subject to any points of detail which individual Ministers might wish to discuss with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the cabinet approved the programme proposed for 1973-75.    It was important that the bulk of the studies, particularly those whichwere strategically the most important, should be completed in time to become the basis for policy initiatives early in thenext Parliament.    The programme would make heavy demands on scarce analytical resources in Departments, as well as onthe administrative staff involved.    The PAR studies should nevertheless continue to be given appropriate priority, since any reduction in total public expenditure which might be necessarycould not be achieved effectively save in the context of aconstantly up-dated assessment of the relative importance of departmental priorities.    Ministers should therefore givepersonal attention to the progress of the studies which concernedthem and should be particularly concerned to ensure that theirjunios Ministers were given the opportunity to participate fully in this work.The Cabinet -Took note, with, approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theChief Secretary, Treasury and the other ministers concerned to proceed accordingly.7. The Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland (CP(73) 27) putting forward proposals for asettlement for Northern IrelandTheir discussion, and the conclusions reached, are recorded separately.Cabinet office March 197311

First, it was essential that theWhite Paper and the subsequent Constitutional Bill should commandbipartisan support in the Parliament at Westminster,    Second, theproposals must be reasonably acceptable to the Government of theRepublic since, even though they might not be prepared to give uspositive support, they would be able to hinder our efforts if theycould not at least acquiesce in our proposals.    Third, the minority in Northern Ireland must feel that they were being given a genuinechance to share in the government and administration of theProvince.    Fourth, the settlement must be such as to giveencouragement to moderate opinion.    But, fifth, our proposals must not be of a kind to lead the Unionists to refuse all co-operation.If it were possible to devise arrangements which satisfied thesecriteria, there was some hope that a settlement might be achieved,even though our proposals would probably be rejected byProtestant extremists and would be unlikely to suffice to cause the Irish Republican Army to cease their violence.
On this basis it would be essential to provide for a new form ofNorthern Ireland Assembly, to which a range of powers, albeitexcluding law and order, would be devolved.    This arrangement was justified by the simple fact that none of the alternative courses of action was acceptable^    Complete integration of Northern Irelandwith the rest of the United Kingdom would be opposed not only bythe minority and many others in the Province but also by the irish republic and by the Opposition in the Parliament at Westminster.It would also impose an intolerable strain upon the WestminsterParliament if all Northern Irish business had to be conducted there;and even those elements in Northern Ireland who claimed to favourintegration would come to resent having their affairs controlledentirely from London.    A reversion to a Northern ireland parliament of the kind which had existed at Stormont before theintroduction of direct rule was equally out of the question; it wasno more likely to prove acceptable to the minority in the future thanit had in the past.    Finally, a genuinely independent NorthernIreland was a wholly unrealistic concept.    If, for these reasons,we had to contemplate a form of local Assembly, which would exercise some of the powers of government, there were two possible methods by which its members might be elected - the single transferable vote (STV) and the Party proportional system(PPS).    There were arguments in favour of each system; but thegroup of Ministers who had examined them had concluded that, on balance, STV was probatly to be preferred.    Whatever methodwas adopted, however, must essentially be based on the principleof proportional representation, which even the Unionist majority would probably accept, albeit with reluctance.An even more critical question was the method by which theExecutive should be derived from the Assembly in such a way asto give effect to our intention that the minority should have a genuine opportunity to share the power of government.    No solutioninvolving the creation of &quot;statutory Catholics&quot; (eg by providing inthe Constitutional Bill that the Executive must include a prescribednumber of Roman Catholics) would be acceptable.    It wasdebatable, however,   whether it would be preferable to state inthe White Paper, and to provide in the subsequent Bill, a precise form for the Executive, eg by prescribing that all Parties with a specified number of seats in the Assembly should have a right toa place in the Executive if they wished to take it up or, perhapspreferably, that a panel of members of the Assembly, elected bya weighted vote (say 75 per cent) by all members of the Assembly,should act as Heads of Departments;  or whether it would be wiser to adopt a more evolutionary approach by confining ourselvesinitially to indicating the principles which would have to be observed in forming the Executive and then waiting until theAssembly had been elected, when it could assume the responsibility2
of devising, subject to the Secretary of State(s approval, its own proposals for forming an Executive,    In the end, however, it mightbe necessary, in order to avoid a deadlock,, that the Executiveshould be appointed by the Secretary of State.    To make it clear from the beginning how it was proposed that the Executive shouldbe formed would have the advantage of conciliating moderate opinion.    But it might prove dangerously premature to commit ourselves in this way until the composition of the initial Assemblywas known, the more so since., if our proposals proved to be wholly unacceptable, we should have no alternative course on which to fall back apart from an indefinite prolongation of direct rule,It might therefore be more prudent to adopt the evolutionaryapproach to the problem, whereby the White Paper would indicateour intentions in terms only of general principles and we would stillretain a measure of flexibility against developments which at thisstage were unpredictable.    The Opposition in the Parliament at westminster would probably be willing to acquiesce in this course.Finally, it was important, not least because of the attitude of theGovernment of the Republic, that the White Paper should contain a constructive passage on the &quot;Irish Dimension&quot;;  and it wastherefore envisaged that it should indicate that, following theelections to the new Northern Ireland Assembly, the Governmentof the Republic and representatives of the Parties in the assembly would be invited by the United Kingdom Government to take partin a conference to discuss how a Council of Ireland might be developed.In discussion it was suggested that the principles governing theformation of an Executive, even if described by the White paper in the context of an essentially evolutionary approach, would need to be so clearly expressed that Unionist sentiment might bealienated from the outset and that from this point of view there might be little to choose between an indication of principles and anexplicit statement of the form which the Executive should take.The main reason why the former Northern Ireland Parliament had failed was the refusal of the majority to share their power.    But,if the White Paper and the Constitutional Bill left the question ofthe manner in which power was to be shared hereafter to be solved by the Assembly, the Government would be criticised for evadingthe most critical issue of alL, since the majority Party in theAssembly would be unlikely to show themselves any moreco-operative in this respect than the majority Party in the formerStormont Parliament,    It was for consideration, therefore,whether the problem might be elided by dispensing with an executive and adopting, instead, a system of Committees of theAssembly, which would have the right to be consulted by Heads of departments on new developments of policy,    Such committees would draw their members from several Parties and would work under the direction of chairmen who might similarly be drawn from
more than one Party,    This arrangement, which would reflectto some extent the practice of local government in Great Britain,would have the advantage that the members of the committees would enjoy direct access to officials and would thus have a realinfluence in governments    On the other hand, while such anarrangement might be appropriate for local councils, a decisionto devolve significant powers of legislation to the Assemblyrequired the creation of an Executive to formulate policy and todecide priorities as the basis of the proposals to be submitted tothe Assembly.    The difficulty would remain, however, thats if themembers of the Executive or the chairmen of the Committees were drawn from a number of Parties, they might be unable to reach agreement, since each would be concerned to advocate the policy on which his Party had fought the Election.    Moreover, even if agreement were reached, a proposal submitted to the Assemblyby an individual who was himself a representativeof a minority Party would be liable to be rejected by the majority in the Assembly;  and the result would be deadlock.    Even so,there had been relatively little dispute in the former NorthernIreland Parliament on issues arising from the limited range of subjects which it was now proposed to devolve to the Assembly;and this suggested that a system of government on the linesenvisaged might prove to be not unrealistic.    It should at leastprovide an incentive to responsible and moderate opinion to expressitself;  and., if deadlock persisted, the matter in question would either have to be remitted to the Assembly for decision or, in thelast resort, be made the subject of legislation in the parliament at Westminster.In further discussion it was suggested that criticism might fastenon the proposal that the office of Secretary of State for NorthernIreland should be retained indefinitely and that its occupant should enjoy considerable powers of intervention, in the last resort, aeregards the composition of the Executive, the acceptability oflegislation and similar matters.    It might well be argued that ihisarrangement would not be compatible with the principles ofParliamentary democracy as they were normally understood;  andit might therefore be preferable to rely rather more on the judiciary and the proposed Bill of Rights for the enforcement of the basic constitutional safeguards, especially as regards the ultimateprotection of the rights of the minority community.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theformation of the Executive was the heart of the matter.    Therewere powerful arguments in favour of the evolutionary approach.But, if the responsibility for proposing the form of the Executivewere laid upon the Assembly, the various Parties would be liableto adopt entrenched positions from which it might prove impossible4
to move them;  and this could re stilt in the frustration of our policy.Whether the method of constituting the Executive was laid downexplicitly in the White Paper or whether the evolutionary approach was adopted, the people of Northern Ireland might refuse *o operate the preferred system or might be prevented by extremist sentimentfrom doing so.    On that hypothesis we might be compelled eitherto maintain direct rule indefinitely or to adopt a policy of integration;  and there were very serious objections to both these courses.    The relationship between the Secretary of State and boththe Assembly and the Executive also raised critical issues;  andthe Secretary of State should discuss further with the Lord chancellor the concept of a different approach to these questions, based on agreater reliance on the judiciary as the ultimate safeguard of constitutional rights.The Secretary of State should now proceed, with due regard to theCabinet1 s discussion, to complete the draft of the White Paper,which would then be discussed first by the group of ministers directly concerned and thereafter by the Cabinet,    He hoped that before the Cabinet&apos;s next meeting on the subject he would have hadan opportunity to discuss the Governments proposals, particularly the &quot;Irish Dimension&quot;, with the Prime Minister of the Republic,in the light of the General Election in the Republic which was takingplace that day.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office2 March 19735
