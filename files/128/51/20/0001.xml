IPARLIAMENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the following week0Wages Paid by-British firms in south AfricaPreviousReference:CM(73) 16thConclusions,Minute 1The Cabinet were informed that the Opposition were anxious that thequestion of the employment practices of British firms operating inSouth Africa should be considered by a Select Committee of theHouse of Commons,    Such a remit might be undertaken either by an existing Select Committee or one of its sub-committees, or by anew Select Committee set up for the specific purpose.    If thematter were not taken up by a Select Committee the Opposition were likely to press for an early debate, perhaps on a censure motion.It could set a very undesirable precedent for a Select Committee to visit a foreign country to collect evidence on matters for which theGovernment of the United Kingdom had no responsibility, and inthis particular case the effect of their doing so might also be harmful.On the other hand, in so far as existing Select Committees were concerned, the Government could not prevent their attempting to take evidence in South Africa even if they were minded to do so.    In thecircumstances, the right course was for the Government tc remainneutral, arguing that the decision was one for the Select committee itself on the lines which the Prime Minister had adopted in. the replyhe had given on 27 March to a supplementary Question by the leader of the Opposition,Export of animals(Control) bill previous reference:CM(73) 4thConclusions,Minute 1The Cabinet were informed that the Export of Animals (Control) bill was now due to be considered on Second Reading on 30 March.    TheMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had remindedSir Ronald Russell, one of the sponsors of this Private member bill, of the action which the Government had recently taken to banthe export of live sheep from this country and had indicated that hewould be willing to investigate any allegations of cruelty in connectionwith the export of cattle.    Any overall ban on the export of livecattle would almost certainly be contrary to this country&apos;s obligations to the European Economic Community (e.c.); but our representatives in the e.c. were endeavouring to ensure that adequate measures were taken by all member countries to secure the maintenance ofsatisfactory standards in relation to the transport and slaughter of live animals.    Sir Ronald Russell had, however, indicated that hewas unwilling to withdraw the Bill and considered that it should be debated in time provided by the Government.    It was undesirable that the Bill should be debated:  and despite the public sympathywhich it had attracted there would for the time being be little difficulty in ensuring that it made no further progress.
OVERSEA 2, THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidAFFAIRS that in the course of the night the Irish authorities had interceptedand arrested the Claudia, a vessel sailing under the Cypriot flag,Arms Shipments        which was found to have five tons of arms and explosives on boardsIt was possible that a further quantity had been put overboard beforethe arrest.    We had alerted the Irish authorities in advance aboutmovements of this vessel but the Government of the IrJsh RepubHcdid not wish it to be known that we had been involved and we were therefore giving no publicity to this facto    The arms and explosives were intended for the Provisional wing of the irish republican Army and there was reason to believe that they had beenloaded in Libya.    We had asked the Irish Government if they could obtain evidence which would enable them to reveal publicly the libyan involvement in the affair.Australia andthe Five PowerDefenceArrangementsTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatwhen the Secretary of State for Defence was in Australia in Februaryhe had received assurances from the Australian Minister for Defence,Mr Barnard, that although the Australian battalion in Singaporewould be withdrawn by the beginning of 1974, there would continueto be a substantial Australian contribution to the forces in singapore and Malaysia under the Five Power Arrangements.    There were now signs that the Australian Cabinet were not prepared to supportthese assurances and that the reduction in the Australian presencemight be more drastic than Mr Barnard had indicated.    This would create a serious problem, and it would be important to discuss thematter with the Australian Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, when hevisited London in April,The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statements by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.IcelandPreviousReference:CM(73) 18thConclusion s.Minute 3THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that discussions between British officials and Icelandic Ministers inReykjavik on 22 March indicated that there might now be a possibilityof negotiating an interim agreement on fishing.    An agreement would have to provide for a catch limitation and it seemed unlikelythat the Icelandic Government would agree to a figure above 130, 000tons a year.    The trawler industry might feel that this was too low;before entering into negotiations he would wish to have an estimateof the catch our trawlers might expect to make if they were obligedto fish under naval protection.    In the days immediately following
the discussions in Reykjavik the Icelandic gunboats had subjectedsome of our trawlers to harassment, but the past two days had beenquiet and he was now disposed to suggest to the Icelandic Governmentthat there should be Ministerial negotiations on 11 April.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat he agreed that negotiations should now be offered, although ourposition might have to be reconsidered if harassment were resumed.Although the figure of 130, 000 tons was lower than the level of catchwhich the industry had regarded as acceptable, he thought that theymight still accept it, provided it was put forward as a firmproposition, and the other aspects of an agreement were acceptable.Looking ahead to the search for alternative fishing grounds he had sent to those of his colleagues mainly concerned a paper about the fishing grounds in the South Atlantic which might merit further study0THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet agreed that the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should now offer Ministerialnegotiations to the Icelandic Government.    The paper on the south atlantic fishing grounds would be considered at an early date.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of thePrime Ministers statement.
tEUROPEAN 3, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidCOMMUNITY that there had been a meeting of the Council of MinistersAFFAIRS (Agriculture) on 26-27 March which had included a preliminary-discussion of proposals made by the Commission for prices underthe Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for 1973-74,    As expected,there had been no agreement and the Council would be returning tothe subject on 9-10 April and perhaps at a further meeting later inApril so that the new price levels could come into effect from 1 May.The Minister of Agriculture had raised in the Council the questionof the margin available to United Kingdom refiners of commonwealth sugar.    Despite strong opposition from the French Minister ofAgriculture he had insisted that the United Kingdom must ensureadequate margins for our refiners if we were to be able to fulfil our obligations to the developing Commonwealth countries.In discussion it was reported that at the Conference of ministers from Commonwealth sugar-producing countries talcing place atLancaster House a rift had developed between Mauritius and theother countries over the allocation of shares of the total quantityof sugar which the Commonwealth might supply to the Communityafter 1974.    It would be unfortunate if Mauritius were to make a unilateral statement on this which detracted from the value of thefinal communique.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said it was important to achieve a harmonious outcome to the Conference;  ifthe Mauritian difficulties could not be met we should be preparedif necessary to forestall any unilateral statement by herrepresentative by one of our own.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister1 summing up of the discussion.4
northern ireland previous reference:CM(73) 18thConclusions,Minute 64.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that important information had been received by the police whichmight well lead to the arrest of some of those persons who had been involved in the recent murder of three soldiers in a house in theAntrim Road.There was considerable pressure in Parliament at Westminster,and elsewhere, for the elections to the Northern Ireland assembly to take place in June.    This would be possible only if the provisions for holding an election under a system of proportional representationwere put into a short Bill, separate from the main ConstitutionalBill.    Even if this were done, however, it would be important thatthe main Bill should not be delayed since it would be highly understandable for the Assembly to come into existence beforethe legislation governing the formation of its institutions and providing for the devolution of power had been passed.    It mightbe desirable for the short Bill to provide that the Assembly shouldnot meet till the Constitutional Bill had passed into law.The Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill, which would giveeffect to the recommendations of the Diplock Commission and lead tothe repeal of the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (NorthernIreland) 1922, would shortly be published.    The Bill would need to specify those organisations to be proscribed; and it would also provide that an organisaticn might be added to the list or removed from it.    A number of organisation^, including the Irish republican army (IRA) and the Ulster Volunteer Force, must clearly be includedin the list.    Difficulty arose, however, on the question whether toinclude Republican Clubs and Sinn Fein.    He proposed thatRepublican Clubs should not be proscribed,, though this decisions would be severely criticised in some Protestant quarters.    Therewas support in Parliament at Westminster for the argument thatSinn Fein should similarly not be proscribed and should thus been abled to contest the forthcoming elections in its own name, since this would show how little public support it enjoyed.    This would however be deeply offensive to Protestant opinion, especially sincethe Provisional Wing of the IRA had announced that it would continueits policy of violence.    Serious trouble must be expected from the protestant side if Sinn Fein were not proscribed and on balance,therefore, he was in favour of proscribing it,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that there should be a short Bill to enable theelections to the Assembly to take place,.    This Bill should be taken through Parliament as quickly as possible.    It was also necessaryto make all speed in preparing the main Constitutional Bill so thatit might be introduced with the minimum delay.    There would be difficulty in completing its passage through both Houses before the
Summed Recess, but it was important that this should be done and close attention would have to be given td the timetable.    The cabinet also agreed th$t Sinn Fein should be included in the list of proscribedorganisations in the Northern Iceland (Emergency Provisions) Bill,but this might be reviewed if serious opposition should develop.The Republican Clubs would not be proscribed.   It had not beenfound possible to include in the Emergency Provisions Bill aprovision to enable the recruitment of women into the UlsterDefence Regiment, and the question whether there should bea short Bill for this purpose would be discussed on the return of the Secretary of State for Defence.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerlssumming up of their discussion.

INDUSTRIAL 5. THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the composition of the Pay Board shouldbe announced that week and that the announcement of the composition of the Price Commission might be deferred until the following week,when it should be possible to announce the full list of members.AFFAIRSPay Boardand PriceCommissionThe CoalIndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 18thConclusion ssMinute 5THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that,since there was a possibility that the outcome of the ballot of mineworkers would become known before the meeting of the ExecutiveCommittee of the National Union of Mineworkers on 3 April, theMinister for Industry should be ready to comment publicly on thesituation if it emerged that the ballot showed a majority in favourof industrial action.NationalHealthServiceAncillaryWorkersPreviousReference:CM(73) 18thConclusions,Minute 5THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that theindustrial action by National Health Service (NHS) ancillary workerswas continuing at an intensity which varied from area to area andalso from day to day.    The dispute was having a considerable effecton the Service and the strain on the doctors and nurses had becomeserious.    There was the risk that both the British medical association and the nurses would make public their anxiety about the situation, which could increase public sympathy forthe ancillary workers.    There was also a risk of unrest amongstthe NHS electriciansr who had now been informed that their pay increase would be subject to the pay limit and not based on theincrease which workers in the electrical contracting industry would receive on 1 April,    There would be a further meeting of theAncillaries Staff Council (as c) on the following day and he remainedready to hold a further meeting with the unions concerned.    Itwas difficult, however, to find any basis on which they might be willing to end the industrial action, even though they might wishto do so.In discussion it was suggested that the attitude of the unions might change when the Pay Code came into force, since it would then bepossible under the Counter-Inflation Act 1973 for the Pay Board, ontheir own initiative, to give notice of their intention to make an Order,or to give notice, restricting the remuneration which might be paid tothe NHS ancillary workers;  and it would then be an offence for theunions concerned to continue industrial action in support of a higherpay increase.    On the other hand, the indications were that theunions would not be deterred by the existence of the sanctions
introduced in the Counter-Inflation Act, believing that the Governmentwould not deem it appropriate that these sanctions should be used bythe Pay Board in this case.    In any event, there would be pressure on the Government to say whether the provisions of the Act would beused or not.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,, said that itwould be desirable to ascertain as soon as possible the course whichthe Pay Board would be likely to adopt in the dispute involving the nhs ancillary workers.    He would be willing to discuss theGovernments tactics further with the Secretary of State for social Services after the as c meeting.    It was however difficultat the present time to see any justification for proposing a further meeting between Ministers and the unions, since the latter would theninevitably expect the Government to have further proposals to put tothem and there was in practice no scope for any increase in the payoffer.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.8
6,        THE HOME SECRETARY asrdd that a Ministerial Group under his chairmanship (GEN 148) had &quot;been conSiaer$l&amp;g possible measures^f&amp;itto restrain land and house prices.    He hoped, to circulate forconsideration by the Cabinet at their next meeting a memorandumssetting out the main conclusions reached, ana shortly thereafter the tort of a draft White Paper,    The Group had been able to formulate useful proposals in relation to land availability andcertain other matters, but had encountered great difficulty inconnection with the availability of mortgage funds on suitable terms.    This was a matter which was crucial to the successfulcontinuance of the housebuilding programme; and if the programmewere interrupted it was doubtful whether it could effectively berestarted during the lifetime of the present Parliament,    In orderto prevent a mortgage famine, Building Societies must have adequatefunds at their disposal; but it was equally important that loans shouldbe available to the public at rates of interest which were acceptable.The Building Societies had at an earlier meeting with ministers agreed that though there would be an immediate! increase in therate of interest offered to investors they would hold their lendingrate at the present figure of 8f per cent until mid-April.    Theposition had, however j recently worsened rapidly, and duringthe previous week the net inflow of funds had amounted only to 2 million, as against th&apos;?  40 million required to maintain thebuilding programme at its present level.    An immediate increasein the landing rate to at leiT.3t 10 per cent seemed inevitable unlessaction were taken by the Government; and GEN 148 had accordingly been considering what steps were possible.    The serious difficulties involved in any form of Government assistance were fully appreciated;but the Group had concluded that the least objectionable course wouldbe to reduce the composite rate of tax paid by the Building Societies.This at present was 24 per cent.    By administrative action (whichwould in practice have to be taken covertly) it could be reduced to21 per cent, which for a period of six months would enable trie rateof interest to be kept \ per cent lower than would otherwise havebeen possible.    This however would be an inadequate offset in the face of the Building societies view that the rate of interest wouldhave to be increased to 10 per cent; but any further reduction in thecomposite rate of taxation would require legislation and would therefore appear as an open subsidy to the Building Societies.,It v/arj estimated that each reduction of 1 per cent in the rate ofinterest to borrowers would involve Government expenditure ofabout  10 million a month.In discussion, it was reported that the Building Societies and thebuilding industry were convinced that if the rate ox interest increasedto 10 per cent there would be an immediate collapse in the output ofhouses; and this lack of confidence on the part of the  nduetry, whetheror not It was objectively justifiable, meant that a substantial reduction
in the number of houses started would almost certainly take place.Such a reduction would not be reversible in the short run.    Thesocial and political consequences of such a failure of the government&apos;s housing policies would be extremely serious;and the effects might be particularly acute in Scotland, whereprivate building, which traditionally had played a minor part inthe provision of housing, had for the first time recently been forgingahead.    It also could not be overlooked that if the rate of interestincreased to 10 per cent net mortgage payments would have gone upby 14 per cent during a time of severe restraint on incomes.    Thiswould clearly have serious implications for the Governmentscounter-inflationary policies.    It was suggested that there wasin fact still some scope for increases in the rate of interest tobe met by lengtheningloanperiods rather than by increasing monthlypayments, and it would be helpful if the Minister for Housing and construction could provide some information on this matter.It was suggested that the Building Societies might be taking an undulyalarmist view.    There was some evidence that the public werespending unusually heavily in anticipation of the imposition of ValueAdded Tax; and the net inflow of funds to the Building Societiesmight well revive in the near future.    There were moreoverformidable difficulties in the provision of financial help by theGovernment,    Politically it would be embarrassing to give further help to home-owners at a time when the tenants of council houses were meeting the full rigour of the fair rent policy.    From thepoint of view of the management of the economy, any addition tothe Government1 s borrowing requirement was highly undesirable;and financial help to the Building Societies could probably only becontemplated if counter-balancing savings in public expenditure weremade elsewhere.    Moreover, a subsidy, even if initially given on atemporary basis, could well in practice become permanent and involve unexpectedly heavy expenditure.In further discussion, it was argued that a great deal depended on the likely future course of interest rates.    If a reduction couldbe expected in the near future the cost of helping the building societies might not be great.    In practice, however, it wouldnot be possible to withdraw help so long as the rate of interestcharged to borrowers continued in excess of its present levelof 8-1 per cent;  and if no decline could be expected in the nearfuture the total cost might be very considerable.    Moreover,it was important not to overlook the consequences which a prolongedsubsidy would have for the independence of the Building Societies.There was also a danger that any additional funds available to themmight be used not to finance the construction of new houses buts ashad been happening recently, to enable the price of houses to bepushed up even further.    Certain measures might however be taken
to prevent this, including the strengthening of the present arrangements for giving preference to first purchasers (whichmight involve the payment of proportionally higher deposits byother purchasers), and the cessation of special advances (under present provisions, those exceeding  13,000).    It would be helpfulfor the Cabinet to have an indication of what scope there was for action under these heads.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thepresent problem was an unforeseen consequence of the policy of controlling credit by competitive interest rates; and the case for modification of this policy might have to be considered.    One ofthe questions relevant to the immediate issue was how long interest rates were likely to remain at their present level;  and on this theviews of the Chancellor of the Exchequer were needed.    The cabinet were in no doubt as to the importance of avoiding any interruption ofthe housing programme; but the objections to subsidising theBuilding Societies were formidable; and if despite these objections,help were made available, it would be necessary to seek to preventits being used to force up house prices still further.    The cabinet should resume their discussion of the matter at their next meeting,at which the Chancellor would be present.    In the meantime, theMinister for Housing and Construction should consider the factualpoints on which further information had been sought in discussion and be ready to report on &apos;hem at the cabinet&apos;s next meetingsThe Cabinet -Took note, with approval^, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office29 March 1973
