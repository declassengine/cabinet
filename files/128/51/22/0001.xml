-building societies     XInterest charge on MortgagesPreviousReferences:CM(73) I9thConclusions,Minute 6 and cm(T3) 20thConclusionsThe Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Home Department (CP(73) 46)on housing policy, and amemorandum by the Central Policy Review Staff (CP(73) 48) on theinterest rate charged on building society mortgages,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that in considering whether to provide financial assistance to restrict the rise in theinterest rate charged by building societies on mortgages, the cabinet would need to consider both whether such assistance was justified on merits, and whether it could be afforded given the present prospectfor public expenditure.    Financial assistance for this purpose would represent a subsidy to owner-occupiers of houses,irrespective of their financial need.    As regards existing owner-occupiers, he had enquired how far they would be able to extend theirrepayment period if the interest rate rose to 9f per cent.    although no reliable figures were available, the Chairman of the building societies Association, Sir Stanley Morton, and the Chief registrar of Friendly Societies had both confirmed that the majority ofborrowers should be able to extend the period.    In such cases, thenet income of the borrower would tend to be somewhat increasedbecause of the additional tax relief.    For first-time purchasers,the significant consideration was the amount of their recurrentpayments, which would be determined by the amount borrowed andthe rate of interest.    If the interest rate rose, the price which the borrower would be prepared to pay would therefore tend to fall.This would not however necessarily have an adverse effect on thehouse building programme.    A survey conducted by the NationalInstitute of Economic and Social Research in 1972 had concluded that interest rates had little effect on the flow of new mortgage advances,which were much more seriously affected by any rationing ofmortgage lending.    This conclusion was also confirmed bySir Stanley Morton both in his capacity as Chairman of the building societies Association and as Chairman of the National Housebuilders&apos;Registration Council, and also by the Chief Registrar of friendly societies, who had consulted a number of leading building societiesas well as the Chairman of the Economic Development Committeefor the Construction Industry,The Government had removed the indiscriminate subsidy fromtenants of local authority housing, and the rents of such houses would on average increase by 11 per cent during the present year, in spiteof the action taken under the counter-inflationary policy.    TheGovernment had also resisted the granting of indiscriminate food subsidies, or of an increase in family allowances.    Owner &quot;Occupiersalready benefited from exemption from capital gains tax on theincrease in the value of their houses-, from income tax relief on mortgage interest, and from a large part of the financial assistance given for house improvement.    Moreover^ in 1971, three-quarters
of building society borrowers already had incomes of  35 a week ormore, so that they did not have a strong case for special treatmenton grounds of financial need.    An indiscriminate subsidy to themdid not therefore seem to be defensible.    It would moreoverinvolve a considerable burden on the Exchequer.    A subsidysufficient to hold down the mortgage interest rate by 1 per cent would cost  120 million in a full year.    The estimates for public expenditure in the current year had however already increased, in real terms, as a result of decisions taken during the lifetime of thepresent Government, by around  1, 500 million.    He did notconsider that it would be reasonable to add a further burden of 120 million a year, against savings so far offered by the Departmentof the Environment of  16 million,    A preferable course would beto try to persuade the building societies to take special steps to helpfirst-time purchasers.    Such steps might include, for example, theoffering of longer repayment terms, possibly up to 35 years, toyounger purchasers; the requirement of lower down-payments for first-time purchasers, possibly balanced by higher down-^payments for second-time purchasers;  and the provision of mortgages on terms involving a rising level of repayments^    In addition^ thebuilding societies could be asked to make it clear that manyexisting mortgagees would have the opportunity to extend theirrepayment period;  and the Government could discuss with the societies the introduction of a long-term scheme for stabilising the flow of mortgage funds,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe prospect of an increase in the mortgage interest rate raisedserious psychological problems, particularly in the context of counter-inflationary policy.    Although it might be claimed thatowner-occupiers made untaxed capital gains, such gains wer^ notreaHsable and provided no immediate help to offset higher mortgagerepayments.    For many borrowers the existing level of repaymentswould be no more than the new interest charge, and in such casesextension of the repayment period did not seem to offer a practical solution.    For those whose repayment period could not be extended,the net cost of repayments would rise by lOf per cent if the interestrate rose to 10 per cent.    Sir Stanley Morton had indicated to theMinister^ Housing and Construction that the building programmecertainly would be affected by an increase in the interest rate, andthis view was also shared by some individual building societies andby the construction industry, who had claimed that the effect on housing starts would be dramatic.    The fact that the Governmenthad pressed the building societies to hold down their lending ratesduring the standstill made it all the more awkward if these rates were to rise abruptly now.    Financial assistance need notnecessarily be indiscriminate, but might be made selective in oneof the ways suggested in paragraph 6 of CP(73) 48, eg by restrictingit to first-time purchasers.    Alternatively, consideration might be2
given to reducing the composite rate of income tax paid by thebuilding societies, or to the possibility of a Government loan orguarantee.    If, as seemed possible, interest rates were to falllater in the year, the cost should be correspondingly limited.The maintenance of a satisfactory housing programme was ofcrucial importance, and of higher priority than other expenditurein his Departments programmes, such as roads and miscellaneous local government expenditure.    If his colleaguesasked him to do so, he would therefore be prepared to find additionaloffsetting savings from these programmes.In discussion, it was recognised that there were cogent arguments for avoiding an indiscriminate subsidy to owner-occupiers, and for not placing further burdens on public expenditure, which would onlyadd to the already difficult task of identifying expenditure savings.On the other hand, the housing programme was a matter of highsocial and political priority, and the Government had been warnedof the risk that it might be seriously affected by a significant increase in building society lending rates.    Moreover, given the increases already forecast in retail prices, the most strenuous efforts would need to be made if the Government were to passsuccessfully through Stage 2 of the counters-inflationary policy inorder to attain a more balanced economic situation in Stage 3,    it did not seem reasonable, when the Government were alreadycontrolling large sections of the economy to this end, that their efforts should be jeopardised by decisions taken independently bythe building societies.    If the building societies persisted in theirpresent intention to raise their lending rates to 10 per centffurther consideration would need to be given to possible measuresto remedy the situation,,    There was however still some uncertainty about what the societies precisely intended to do.    They had originally contemplated increasing their borrowing rate to6.3 per cent and their lending rate to 9f per cent.    They now appeared to envisage a borrowing rate of 6f per cent and lendingrate of 10 per cent, and some individual societies had already moved to this rate, or even higher.    In contemplating such a move, the societies appeared to be over-reacting to the high withdrawalsduring March, which by the end of the month had nearly reachedthe level of the regular flow of new deposits.    These withdrawalsdid not however appear to be matched by greater investment inV   competitive investment media, and it was more likely that they had gone to finance purchases made in anticipation of the start of value-added tax on 1 April,    Withdrawals for that purpose should now have ceased, and a borrowing rate of 60 3 per cent should enable the societies to remain competitive in present conditions.Before any further measures were considered, there would be advantage therefore in making a further attempt to persuade the societies that there was no real need to increase their rates beyond this level.3
In further discussion the following points were made -a. It had been suggested that the recent changes inthe system of credit control and in taxation had made building societies a less attractive investment medium than before.While the introduction of the new system of credit controlhad represented a desirable economic reform, come remedial action might need to be taken if it turned out in practice that interest rates were teaming to spiral xxpwards.    But there seemed no reason why the new system should necessarily have this effect, and the clearing banks had in fact justdecided to lower their base lending rates.    The real causes of the higher level of interest rates at the present time werethe need to finance a high level of Government borrowing,which flowed from the increased level of public expenditure,and the current rate of inflation, which meant that even thepresent level of interest rates offered only a relativelymodest real return,b. As regards taxation, there v/as no reason why thebuilding societies should suffer as a result of the new systemof personal taxation.    The composite rate of tax paid by thebuilding societies would be automatically adjusted to take account of the reduction in the normal rate of tax borne on investment income^    A further reduction in the compositerate of tax, from 24 per cent to 21 per cent, would permit a reduction in the mortgage interest rate of about \ per cent.It would not be practicable to increase the effective benefit by concentrating it on a shorter period, and the cost wouldbe broadly the same as for a subsidy of equivalent effect.But the main difficulty in such a proposal v/as that thecomposite rate would normally not be settled until June,and if the change would have to remain confidential untilthen, it would not help to deal with the immediate problem.It might however be possible to offer to enter into discussions with the building societies about the level of the compositerate,c. If it should prove necessary to offer financialassistance, there were serious disadvantages in a straight-forward subsidy of the mortgage interest rate, which wouldbe costly and open-ended.    Selective systems on the lines suggested in paragraph 6 of GP(73) 48, might help to reducethe cost, although not as much as suggested in paragraph 6i.of the paper, and it would take time to introduce anyselective system,    A preferable method might be to give assistance in the form of a Government loan or guarantee,designed to lead on to the setting up of a long-termstabilisation fund.    A loan to the building societies for a4ECRET
specific purpose was not unprecedented, and an issue ofprinciple was not therefore involved, but it would still beimperative to find offsetting savings in public expenditure.If the money were raised from other sources with aGovernment guarantee, this would still compete with efforts to finance the Government borrowing requirement,    Aguarantee of this kind would also involve some risk that, ifa building society subsequently became insolvent, theGovernment would be expected to make good any deficiency,d. In order to improve the availability of mortgage funds for ordinary house purchase, building societies might beasked to stop making &quot;special&quot; advances, ie those for morethan  13, 000,    But apart from advances made to builders,which would need to be exempted from such a restriction,such advances only amounted to about 6 per cent of totalbuilding society lending.    Because of existing commitments,the effect of such a restriction would in any case only be gradual,e. It could be argued that the shortage of mortgage fundsresulted from undue weight being placed in the housing programme on private building for sale.    There might be advantage in encouraging more building to rent, which would assist the mobility of labour, or asking local authorities tobuild more houses for sale.    On the other hand, the encouragement of home ownership and an increasedemphasis on private sector building were fundamental tothe Government1 s housing policy.    An increase in public sector building would also place substantially greateradditional burdens on public expenditure.    While assistance for owner-occupiers might be criticised at a time whenlocal authorities^rents were rising, it could be pointed outthat, for tenants with less than average earnings, the effectof the rent increases in 1973 had been fully offset by the improvements made in rent rebates.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,, said that anincrease in building society lending rates to 10 per cent could havea grave effect at a time when incomes were being strictly controlled.The success of the counter-inflationary policy was of crucial importance, as also was the maintenance of a satisfactory housing programme.    Moreover, there did not appear at present to be an objective case for a lending rate of more than 9i per cent.    TheChancellor of the Exchequer, together with the Secretary of Statefor the Environment and the Minister for Housing and Construction,should therefore hold urgent discussions with the Building SocietiesAssociation with a view to ascertaining their intentions and if possiblepersuading them that the lending rate should not be increased beyond9&quot;a per cent.    The need for any further action by the Governmentwould have to be considered in the light of the outcome of these discussions. -
The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval) of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.        Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer,in consultation with the Secretary of State forthe Environment   and the Minister for housing and Construction, to hold urgent discussions withthe Building Societies Association on the lines indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up,and to report the outcome to the Prime minister as soon as possible.Cabinet Officf4 April 19736
