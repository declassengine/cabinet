Pay and prices the NextPhasePreviousReference:CM (72) 50thConclusionsSECRET*The Cabinet were informed of the measures under considera-tion for the next stage of the Governments policy to counterinflation.The Prime Minister said that very careful and detailed con-sideration had been given during the pay and prices standstill tothe possible policies which the Government might adopt during theperiod after the standstill. The underlying considerations had been,first, that the value of the standstill period should not be lost bysubsequently allowing pay and prices increases to return to thepre-standstill levels, with the consequent need for the Governmentto face further confrontations with organised labour in an attemptto reintroduce a policy of de-escalation; second, that the control exercised by Departments during the standstill must be replacedin the next stage of the policy by machinery which would incorporateboth the principles which the Government wished to adopt and aflexible system to implement those principles, free from detailedintervention by the Government, even though the government&apos;s supporters might find the continuance of controls hard to accept;third, that there should also be some voluntary machinery for consultation with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) andthe Trades Union Congress (TUC) on the management of the economy, preferably on a tripartite basis, if the TUC were willingto co-operate in this; and, fourth, that public opinion would stillexpect the Governments policies to incorporate the objectivesannounced at the time of the tripartite discussions during theprevious autumn, of sustained growth of the economy at 5 per cent,of effective measures to counter inflation and of fair treatment ofall parties, including particularly consideration of the needs of thelow-paid and of pensioners. The general discussions which had beenheld during the previous week with the CBI, the TUC and therepresentatives of the leading retail organisations had been basedon these considerations.  The retailers had made clear their desireto co-operate as fully as possible with the Government in price restraint and their willingness to make available the necessary information on turnover and profit. But, while they had indicated that they could continue to operate under the present controls during any extension of the standstill period up to the 60 days&apos; maximum,they saw serious difficulty thereafter.  The retail industry operated on small margins; and they forecast that, if these were reduced toosharply, the controls would be evaded by changes in the descriptions of products or the importation of alternative products not subjectto existing margins.   The retailers therefore strongly advocatedcontrol based on gross percentage margins, together with, if theGovernment so wished, control of total profits, both of which couldbe reduced if proved to be excessive.  They had also asked for a* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
separate body to monitor food prices, which were subject to frequentfluctuations and afforded particularly small margins. It, wastherefore proposed to set up a separate panel, within the frame-work of the Price Commission, to deal with food prices. the tuc representatives, who had come to protest about the effects of the standstill and the particular delay in wage negotiations,adopted a more reasonable attitude than had been expected; butthey had offered no constructive suggestions on future policy.They had pressed to be given the earliest possible information onthe policy for the next stage but had not agreed to tripartite dis-cussion about its content. This might not necessarily provedisadvantageous, however, if continued bilateral discussion proved possible. There were obvious problems about the amount of confidential information concerning the Governmenfs proposedpolicies which could be given to the TUC at this stage; but a noteoutlining the policy would be provided for their consideration. Itwas possible that the meeting had served to bring home to the TUCthe problems which had to be solved during the next stage. the cbi had accepted that machinery was needed to control prices;and they had argued in favour of separate agencies for pay and prices, with separate control of food prices. They had emphasised the need for the policies to leave scope for essential investment by industry. They had also put forward constructive proposals forthe pay policy, which contained two main elements. They had suggested that the limit on pay increases should incorporate botha percentage element and a cash sum, e.g. a maximum increase of4 per cent on earnings for a standard working week, excludingovertime, plus  1 per week which, though not mandatory, in practicethey expected all workers to receive. The cash sum would help thelow-paid, while the percentage increase on the wage bill wouldprovide some scope for collective bargaining, to which both the cbi and the TUC attached importance. Second, the CBI hadadvocated that all pay settlements with an operative date between  November, 1972 and 5 November, 1973, should be deferred by90 days. In subsequent discussion, however, their representatives had admitted that there were severe practical difficulties about thisproposal. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had also discussed thesituation with the Chairmen of the nationalised industries, whohad expressed concern about the effect of the Governmenfs policieson their economic operation. Only the Chairman of the GasCorporation, however, had expressed doubt whether the unionsrepresenting the gas industry workers would accept policies on thelines which had been indicated. The Chairmen had also asked tobe allowed to join the CBI team in subsequent discussions; butthere were certain disadvantages in this proposal so far as trypartite discussions were concerned.There were two main alternative courses as regards pay whichthe Government might now adopt. The first involved making aclean break with the level of pay settlements which had obtained before the standstill and establishing a very low limit for futureincreases, at least for the next year, in keeping with the need to counter inflation.   This was in many ways very attractive and
should achieve the combined objectives of securing the maximumvalue from the standstill and of enforcing a significant reductionin wage expectations. On the other hand it would create difficult problems as regards the treatment of both the groups of workers,principally the agricultural workers, who had agreed settlementsbefore the standstill came into force and those, also withimplementation dates during the standstill, whose negotiations had been suspended. A number of these had close links withgroups which had achieved settlements shortly before the standstill;and the agricultural workers had in any event been promised theiraward at the end of the standstill. Even if some satisfactorymeans could be found of dealing with this transitional period,there was a risk that the most powerful groups of workers, suchas those at Fords who were seeking very large increases in orderto achieve parity with the remainder of the motor industry, would succeed in finding ways of defeating the policy. The second alternative involved a more gradual reduction in the level of pay settlements, using the remainder of the 1972-73 pay round to resolve these difficulties before the introduction of a more stringentpolicy in the autumn. During this transitional period all settle-ments would be limited to an increase of 7 per cent on the wagebill in the 12 months following the normal operative date; but nosettlement would be delayed more than 90 days. One disadvantage of this &quot; step by step &quot; proposal was that the arrangements whichwould need to be made in order to introduce an element of fairnessof treatment during the transitional period would inevitably makethe pay policy more complicated than the proposals which hadbeen discussed with the TUC and the CBI in the previous autumn and had commended themselves to public opinion by virtue oftheir simplicity and fairness. An even more serious disadvantagemight be the fact that public opinion had expected a total stand still and would now be expecting the new policy to be a new starting point. It was questionable, therefore, whether the public wouldunderstand or support measures which comprised only a progressivediminution of the level of pay increases during the extension whichwould be necessary to secure the passage of the new legislation.The &quot; step by step &quot; approach would make less impact on inflationduring 1973 than the &quot;clean break&quot; approach, but the position might be reversed in 1974. It would be possible, however, to com-bine the &quot; step by step &quot; approach with the CBFs proposal for a limit combining a percentage and a lump sum; and this arrangement might have presentational advantages.As regards prices the proposed policy had been based on theminimum organisation necessary to secure an effective degree ofcontrol. Manufacturing industry would be permitted to increase prices only to the extent that it had to meet unavoidable costs;allowable costs would be strictly defined; and retailers&apos; gross per-centage margins would be controlled. These arrangements, whichwould be supplemented by control of profits, would ensure that part of the benefit of increased productivity was passed on to theconsumer. The nationalised industries would be subject to thesame arrangements.   The likely criticism of the pay and prices
proposals, which would have to be countered by careful presenta-tion, was that the price control system was simple but potentiallylax whereas the pay policy was complicated and severe. Since itappeared unlikely that the TUC would participate in tripartitemachinery to supervise the implementation of the policy, it wouldbe necessary to achieve this through the guidance which would begiven, by means of periodical statutory Order to the two proposed new agencies, the Pay Board and the Price Commission. It wouldbe important to give these agencies sufficient freedom to fulfil theirtasks without conceding exceptions on a scale which would jeopardise the policy. The 200 largest companies in industry wouldbe required to notify the Board and the Commission beforeincreasing pay and prices; and, since the impact of these agencies&apos;rulings could in some cases be severe, it would be desirable toprovide some machinery of appeal. It would be necessary toconsider whether this should involve the Government or not.The Cabinet should now seek to form a view on the fundamentalquestion whether it would be preferable to adopt a stringent policy on pay or to replace the pay &quot; freeze&quot; with a &quot; thaw&quot; whichwould subsequently need, in a sense, to be reversed in the autumn.The question of the more specific measures which might be takento help the low-paid would also need further consideration. Adraft of the proposed White Paper and Bill would be circulatedto the Cabinet after the further round of meetings with-ihe TUC,the CBI and the retailers later that week, for discussion before theWhite Paper was published on 17 January. The Bill would bepublished on 23 January; and the Second Reading in the House ofCommons would be on 29 January. It would not be possible tosecure the passage of the Bill before the end of the standstill period at the end of February; but it would be important that the royal assent should be signified before 1 April, since the Bill would include a provision requiring a reduction in prices, where appropriate, to take account of the consequences of the introductionof value added tax.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the important feature of the proposal on pay under the &quot; step by step &quot; approach was that all those groups of workers whose pay increases had been arrested by the standstill, other than groups such as the agricultural workers who had been promised their full increases when it ended,would be limited to increases of 7 per cent on the annual wagebill in the 12 months following the normal operative date. TheNational Health Service ancillary workers, for example, would beentitled during the remaining months of the pay year to an increaseof 9-3 per cent on rates, or  1-96 a week for male workers, whichwould compare with the  2-40 increase received by the localgovernment manual workers. All increases in rates would be lessthan 10 per cent; and the annual increase in the burden on the economy in 1973, which was the main consideration, would be ata basic rate of 7 per cent or between 9-10 per cent allowing for&quot;wage drift&quot;. No group would be able to claim exceptionaltreatment; but the unions would be able to negotiate within the
limit proposed. On the other hand, if the &quot; clean break &quot; approachwere adopted, it would be difficult to defend offering no morethan the increase justified by the increase in the cost of living afterthe standstill. But, if settlements were to take account of theincrease in the cost of living since the standstill was introduced, thiswould involve an increase amounting to 6 per cent by the end of1973, which, together with &quot; wages drift&quot;, would amount to 8 or 9per cent, i.e. to little less than would be permitted by the &quot; stepby step&quot; approach. But, while the latter method was moreobjective, it would nevertheless appear illogical to public opinionthat the level of increase should be higher immediately after the standstill than in the autumn. The Governmenfs proposals mustbe fair; but they must also be sufficiently severe to convince publicopinion at home and abroad that the Government were determined to defeat inflation.In discussion, it was suggested that the &quot; clean break &quot; policy had certain attractions. If Parliament was to be invited to enactfurther legislation about prices and incomes, the Governmenfsobjective must be seen to be worthwhile and their intentions mustbe clearly designed to produce a significant change in inflationaryexpectations. From this point of view the &quot; step by step &quot; approachmight appear to be not sufficiently differentiated from the previousde-escalation policy. The addition of statutory backing would notnecessarily, therefore, ensure its success or remove the risk of confrontation; and it would accordingly do little to encourageindustrial confidence or to stimulate new investment. A cleanbreak should be more effective in changing expectations, even if itwas necessary to concede some provision for exceptions in orderto deal with those individuals who had suffered unduly as a resultof the standstill.On the other hand to try to impose a settlement based on theclean break approach in the case of the National Health Serviceancillary workers and other groups who could claim links withindustries which had received large increases in pay before the standstill would be widely regarded as unjust, and would be liableto lead to considerable industrial unrest, which would be damaging to international confidence. It would also leave the Governmentwith no alternative course on which to fall back if it provoked aserious confrontation with organised labour which the Governmentfound themselves unable to resist. The &quot; step by step &quot; approach should promote a continuing reduction in the rate of increase in money wages, whereas the clean break approach might be seen asopening the way to a gradual return to unrestricted collective bargaining at the old levels. Even so it was doubtful whether a&quot; step by step &quot; approach based on an initial ceiling of 7 per centon the increase in the wage bill in the 12 months following thenormal operative date would be seen as a sufficiently firm policy,since the consequent rise in earnings, including &quot; wage drift&quot; wouldbe more than 9 per cent. Consideration should therefore be givento a somewhat lower ceiling, e.g. 6\ or even 6 per cent, with due regard to the difficulties which would arise if the average increasein earnings after tax was less than the rate of increase in the costof living.
Moreover, although the arguments for the &quot; step by step &quot;approach appeared persuasive, it would be difficult to enlist thesupport of public and moderate trade union opinion for this policyunless it could be seen to be fair and reasonable. A considerablepublic relations effort would therefore be needed to explain it insimple terms, which the public could understand. It would also benecessary to demonstrate that the Government had not lost sight of the need to help the low paid and pensioners, which hadbeen reflected in the proposals put forward at Chequers inSeptember. In this connection there seemed considerable attractionin the suggestion by the CBI that the ceiling on increases in pay should be expressed as a relatively low percentage in relation to theannual wage bill plus  1 per employee. In addition, some modifica-tion of policy as regards rents would assist the low paid; and,although land prices in this country were still lower than on thecontinent of Europe, it would be psychologically important to beseen to take some action to deal with speculation in land.In subsequent discussion the following main points weremade (a) Under the &quot; step by step &quot; approach the intention to effect afurther reduction in the ceiling on pay increases in the autumncould be criticised as inconsistent with the general objective ofan increasing level of prosperity. It would need to be carefullyexplained that the reduction would be expressed in terms of therate of increase in money wages and that the ceiling would be fixed in relation to increases in the cost of living, with the result that realliving standards would continue to rise. It would also be necessaryto take action to reduce the forecast &quot; peak &quot; in the retail price index in the second quarter of 1973. Possible measures for thispurpose, e.g. in relation to rents, school meals, etc., were already under consideration.(b) Although there might be difficulties in presenting the&quot; step by step &quot; approach as a sufficiently firm and positive policy,it would in fact involve considerable reductions in the pay settle-ments expected by some major groups, such as the coal miners andFord motor car workers, during the coming months. It would be important, therefore, not to introduce any unnecessary irritants intoindustrial relations; and for this reason it would be preferable notto adopt the suggestion of the CBI that settlement dates shouldcontinue to be deferred throughout a 12-month period.(c) The problem of land speculation might be examined interms of several possible approaches. Some form of short-termtax was technically possible but was likely to result in either a curtailment of the supply of land or a further increase in land prices.A time limit on planning permissions might be helpful, although itwas perhaps unlikely in practice that, if the time limit expired, the permission would not be renewed. The most productive approachappeared to lie in considerably expediting the issue of planningpermissions and the release of land; and proposals for this purposewere already under consideration.  If the supply of land could be
increased to the point at which prices began to fall, individuals whowere hoarding land might be encouraged to sell more quickly.(d) Further consideration would need to be given to the way in which the pay of the Civil Service would be dealt with under thenew policy. Because of the nature of the pay research system, thiswould involve considerable presentational problems.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet favoured the &quot; step by step &quot; approach in principle but feltthat consideration should be given to the adoption of a rather lowerceiling on increases in pay than 7 per cent on the annual wage bill.They also felt that the new policy should show continuing concern for the objectives agreed in the tripartite discussions, particularly as regards assistance to the pensioner and the low-paid. In thisconnection they saw considerable attraction in the idea of expressing the ceiling as a percentage of the wage bill plus  1 per employee.For the purposes of the White Paper it would be important to presentthe policy as simply as possible in order that it might be seen bythe public and moderate trade union opinion to be both firm and fair. The possibility of direct Government action to reduce the retail price index was already under consideration. Some measuresto deal with land speculation would also be of considerablepsychological importance in attracting public support for the policy,although there were serious practical difficulties in the various proposals which had been considered so far. The Secretary of Statefor the Environment should continue to give urgent considerationto this problem, with a view to devising measures which would increase the supply of land and restrain the increase in land prices.The preliminary views which had been expressed by the cabinet at the present meeting would be taken into account both in thefurther consultations with both sides of industry which would betaking place later in the week and in the preparation of the draft white Paper and legislation which the Cabinet would be invited toconsider at a meeting in the following week.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office,9 January, 1973.
