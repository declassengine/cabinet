InternationalMonetarySituationPreviousReference:CM (71) 46thConclusions,Minute secret* 1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thatfollowing the intensive consultations which had taken place duringthe preceding few days between the Under Secretary of the UnitedStates Treasury, Mr. Volcker, and the Finance Ministers of theFederal Republic of Germany, France, Italy and the UnitedKingdom, the Government of the United States had announced a10 per cent devaluation of the dollar on the understanding that thecountries of the European Economic Communities (e.c.) would notimplement a parallel devaluation of their respective currencies andthat the Japanese yen would be allowed to float. So far as theUnited Kingdom was concerned the agreed arrangements implied that sterling would continue to float. In practice, however, this was unlikely to entail a full 10 per cent appreciation of sterling in relationto the dollar; and to this extent our competitive position in europe would be improved. The lira would also float, although the ItalianGovernment wished to retain the two-tier market as well. There hadbeen close consultation with our principal e.c. partners throughout;and the possibility of a common European float had been explored. Inthe time available, however, it had not been possible to work out thepractical details of the mutual support and reserve pooling whichwould have been necessary. In any case the real problem lay betweenthe United States and Japan; and the Deutschmark had become thefocus of the crisis largely because Japanese controls had compelledfree dollars to find some alternative source of quick profit. It wastherefore a critical element in the new arrangements that, while there might be some delay for reasons of Japanese domestic politics, theyen could be expected to float upwards by perhaps 10 per cent beforevery long. If so, the solution to the recent currency imbalanceswhich would then have been achieved would be a logical one; and itwould be a matter of some satisfaction that, as a result of the readiness-ness of the United States Government to devalue the dollar, agree-ment would have been reached so much more rapidly than on thelast occasion of the same kind some 18 months earlier. Moreover,the settlement should help to improve relations between the e.c. andthe United States and should facilitate progress on international monetary reform.In discussion some concern was expressed about the impact ofthe new arrangements on our balance of payments. In particular, ifthe devaluation of the dollar resulted in a diversion of Japaneseexports to Europe, this could affect us seriously at the moment whenindustrial investment in the United Kingdom was reviving. On theother hand, if the yen floated upwards, this would affect the Japanesecompetitive position in Europe; and to the extent that sterling^appreciation in relation to the dollar was less than the fixed Europeancurrencies we should benefit. Much would depend, however, on the timing of these developments; and, if the yen did not float upwardsfairly soon, we might have to consider other measures, particularly the use of our safeguards provision, in order to protect our interests.It was therefore very relevant that the United States had only agreed* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
secret the Future of 2.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of broadcasting State for the Home Department (CP (73) 7), to which was attached a draft White Paper containing observations by the Minister of posts and Telecommunications and the Independent broadcasting authority (IBA) on the Second Report of Session 1971-72 from theSelect Committee on Nationalised Industries.The Home Secretary said that the report of the Select Committeecontained 30 recommendations, of which nine fell to be considered bythe Minister and the rest by the IBA. Several of the recommenda-tions addressed to the Minister raised fundamental issues about thefuture of broadcasting after 1976, when the Charter of the british broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the Television and Sound Broad-casting Acts and the licences of the broadcast relay companies would all expire. The Select Committee had proposed that a wide-rangingindependent inquiry into the future of broadcasting should be held before that date; and this had attracted considerable support in severalquarters. The Ministerial Committee on Broadcasting, however,had recommended that this proposal should be rejected on thegrounds that past experience cast doubt on the practical value ofsuch an inquiry; that, since the BBC had a new Chairman and the term of office of the Chairman of the IBA ended in 1973, the headsof both organisations should be allowed time in which to make their influence felt before being called to account; and that, althoughimportant technological developments in broadcasting were pending,they were not likely to mature in &apos;the immediate future. TheCommittee had therefore concluded that the present arrangements should be extended until 1981 (a course which would entail legislation in relation to the IBA) and that the Government need not at thisstage determine their attitude towards the possibility of promotingan independent inquiry in 1975 or shortly thereafter.A decision to this effect would give rise to controversy. this might be mitigated to some extent if the Ministers observationsindicated the Governmenfs policy on certain other issues, includingthe allocation of the fourth television channel, the broadcasting needsof Scotland, Wales and rural England and the representation ofviewers&apos; interests; and it was therefore proposed that the reply to theSelect Committee should state that these issues would be dealt within proposals which the Government would present to parliament before seeking approval for the extension till 1981 of the television and Sound Broadcasting Acts and the BBC Charter. But the termsof reference of the proposed limited inquiry into the broadcastingto the new arrangements on the basis of firm assurances about thefuture movement of the yen.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.
needs of Scotland, Wales and rural England should not mention thefourth television channel, since its use must be decided in a widercontext. Nor should the Minister comment on the Select Commit-tee&apos;s recommendations about the future of the IBA levy, which required further consideration by the Ministerial Committee on broadcasting. As regards the question of a consumer organisation for all communication media, however, the comprehensive proposalcanvassed by the Select Committee was unacceptable but the broad-casting authorities were in fact already being consulted about themeans by which television viewers&apos; interests could best be represented.In discussion it was suggested that public opinion might reactadversely to a decision to reject considered arguments in favour of anindependent inquiry into a matter which raised wide issues of public importance. In particular, it would be unwise to base this decisiontoo confidently on an expectation that important new technological-logical developments would occur before 1981. On the other hand the Pilkington Inquiry in 1963 had resulted in protracted disruptionof the BBCs activities; and this was a cogent reason against embark-ing on another inquiry of the same kind, which might be givengreater emphasis in the Ministers draft observations. Moreover,there was growing concern about the content and social impact of television programmes; and this salutary current of opinion mightwell be stronger in two or three years&apos; time. In this context theappointment of the new Chairman of the BBC had been well received by the Governmenfs supporters and the need to give himopportunity to make his influence felt within the BBC was anadditional argument for resisting the demand for an independentinquiry at the present juncture.In further discussion it was suggested that the proposed limitedinquiry into the broadcasting needs of Scotland, Wales and ruralEngland was intended to serve two purposes which might better be distinguished first, the coverage of the remoter areas of GreatBritain; second, the problem of Welsh language broadcasts. Theformer might be met by a less elaborate inquiry into the technical difficulties which would increasingly arise as transmission on 405lines was superseded by transmission on 625 lines and the inhabitants of the remoter areas of the country would therefore be increasinglydeprived of television reception unless this problem was givengreater priority than e.g. the development of the fourth channel.The other subject of inquiry, however, raised wider and more political issues, particularly in Wales, where there was growing pressure forthe fourth channel to be brought into use, in order to satisfy thedemand for broadcasts in the Welsh language. Moreover, theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland considered that the problemsof broadcasting coverage in Northern Ireland should not be excludedfrom the scope of the inquiry; and here too, political issues ofbalanced reporting or alleged discrimination might be involved, in a particularly acute form.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved in principle the Minister^ proposed reply to theSelect Committee. It would be desirable, however, to reinforce the
arguments rejecting the proposal for a wide-ranging independentinquiry; and the passage dealing with the representation of viewers&apos;opinions should also be strengthened by a reference to the consulta-tions already in train with the broadcasting authorities. The questionof a limited inquiry would need further consideration. NorthernIreland need not necessarily be excluded from such an inquiry. but its terms of reference should make it clear that its scope would not beas wide as that of the wide-ranging inquiry canvassed by the SelectCommittee; and the Broadcasting Committee should reconsider thematter from this point of view. The Minister should consult theHome Secretary about the presentation of these questions in para-graph 12 of his observations.The Cabinet 1. Approved in principle the terms of the draft observations ofthe Minister of Posts and Telecommunications on theSecond Report of the Select Committee on nationalised industries, subject to the points made by the PrimeMinister in the summing up of their discussion.2.  Invited the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications (i) In consultation with the Home Secretary, to arrangefor publication of his observations, as amended.(ii) To circulate to the Ministerial Committee on Broad-casting, in the light of their discussion, further proposals for a limited inquiry into the broad-casting needs of Scotland, Wales, rural Englandand Northern Ireland.3. Took note that the Ministerial Committee on Broadcastingwould consider proposals about the future of the Indepen-dent Broadcasting Authority levy.The NewParliamentaryBuildingPreviousReference:CM (72) 52ndConclusions,Minute 5CONFIDENTIAL3. The Minister for Housing and Construction said that hewould shortly have to give evidence to the Select Committee on house of Commons (Services) about the recommended action intheir Fifth Report (Session 1971-72) that the House of commons should adopt the winning design for the new Parliamentary Building.A good many reservations had been expressed by the Greater london council and others about the design of the new building, which wouldprovide 450 single rooms for Members of Parliament and ancillaryoffice, social and recreational accommodation, linked by an under-ground concourse with the Palace of Westminster. The Royal FineArts Commission, however, had in general favoured the design.The cost limit placed on the building for the purposes of the compe-tition had been  5-4 million at January 1970 prices. It now appeared that at current prices the cost would be at least  10-5 million; and,when allowance was made for site acquisition and for the substantialancillary works which would be necessary, the total cost of the
project would be in the region of  30 million. Expenditure of this order, representing about  50,000 per Member of Parliament, couldnot now be justified. A preferable course might be to acquire theremaining portions of the Bridge Street site and to consider how theneeds of Members of Parliament could be met by using the betterexisting buildings on the site, by gradually redeveloping other parts ofit and, if necessary, by providing some additional accommodationwithin the Palace of Westminster.In discussion it was agreed that it would be undesirable toproceed with the new building at the present juncture. Acquisitionof the Bridge Street site, however, should be completed in order thatit might be comprehensively developed at a later stage if a suitable opportunity occurred. The preparation of alternative proposals forusing the site to meet Parliamentary needs should take account of theneed to redevelop the Cannon Row Police Station, where the existingaccommodation was now wholly inadequate and the provision of improved premises, which had been under discussion for someyears, was urgently necessary.But, although most of the Governments supporters were likely toagree that the proposed new building should be abandoned, it wouldbe tactically inexpedient for the Government to appear to havealready reached a firm decision on a matter which was essentially forthe House of Commons to judge. If the most recent information about costs was suitably presented and it was made clear at the sametime that other methods of meeting the needs of Membersof Parliament were being considered, the Services Committee wouldprobably conclude for themselves that the new ParliamentaryBuilding should be abandoned; and this would be the most desirableoutcome.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the new Parliamentary Building should not be built at present. This decision would need careful presentation;and further thought should be given to the tactics which should beadopted when the Minister for Housing and Construction gave evidence to the Select Committee. The Bridge Street site, however,was of major importance; and its acquisition should be completed inorder to leave the way open for later comprehensive redevelopmentshould this be thought desirable. Meanwhile, the Minister for housing and Construction should explore alternative methods of meetingthe needs of Members of Parliament for additional accommodation,taking into account also the requirements of the Cannon Row PoliceStation. He should report his conclusions initially to the ministerial committee on Regional Policy and the Environment.The Cabinet 1.  Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.2.  Invited the Minister for Housing and Construction (i) To consider, in consultation with the Lord Presidentof the Council, the tactics to be adopted when he
gave evidence to the Select Committee on Houseof Commons (Services).(ii) To circulate to the Ministerial Committee on regional policy and the Environment proposals for other methods of providing Members of Parliament with alternative accommodation and for the improve-ment of Cannon Row Police Station.Cabinet Office13 February, 1973.
