SubjectPay and prices the Next Phase
SECRETPay and *The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of thePrices Exchequer (CP (73) 1) annexed to which were drafts of a White paper the Next on the next stage of pay and prices policy and of the Counter-InflationPhase Bill.  They also had before them further drafts of the White PaperPrevious        and the Bill which had been prepared in the light of discussion amongReference:      the Ministers primarily concerned since the circulation of CP (73)1.CM (73) 1stConclusions The Prime Minister said that since the Cabinet had discussed the proposed pay and prices policy at their previous meeting therehad been further consultations with the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI), the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and represent-atives of the retail trade. The CBI delegation had included LordMelchett, the Chairman of the British Steel Corporation, to representthe nationalised industries, and there had therefore been no separatemeeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the chairmen of the nationalised industries. The CBI had expressed concern,mainly on behalf of the nationalised industries, that a pay limit duringthe second stage of the pay and prices policy of  1 a week peremployee plus 4 per cent of the present wage bill would be insufficient to prevent serious industrial confrontations. They had thereforepressed for the level to be  1 plus 5 per cent of the wage bill. the tuc representatives, in marked contrast to the previous meeting, hadbeen unable to put forward any co-ordinated views except an un-willingness to co-operate in a statutory policy. The representativesof the retailers had been constructive and anxious to co-operate withthe Government.The group of Ministers most closely concerned had now developed a complete set of proposals for the approval of the Cabinet. It was now proposed that the two agencies, the Pay Board and the price commission, under the latter of which would be a separate panel toconsider food prices, would have powers to control prices, pay, divi-dends and rents for a period of three years in the first instance. these powers would subsequently be renewable annually, but could be terminated at any time. The fact that the United States Governmenthad just decided to amalgamate their Pay Board and Price Corn-mission into a single body need not be an embarrassment in this context, since they had reached a later stage in their policy, and were acting with the co-operation of their trade union movement. the code giving guidance to the two agencies would be subject to periodicreview, and would require approval by Affirmative Resolutions ofboth Houses of Parliament. The notices and orders issued by the agencies, however, would not be subject to Parliamentary procedure.Much thought had been devoted to the problem of the right of appeal against decisions of the agencies, which the Cabinet had discussed attheir last meeting. Appeals to the courts could, in general, be onlyon legal grounds, not on the substance of the decision; but a provisionfor appeals to the appropriate Minister might lead to a considerableamount of pressure on Ministers, who would thus become directly involved in any confrontation. It had been decided that, on balance,Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
the best arrangement would be for Ministers to have power to over-rule the agencies, if after consulting the agency concerned, there appeared to be exceptional circumstances sufficient to justify suchintervention. The Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Actwould be extended for 60 days in order to enable the new Bill to be passed through Parliament. The length of the standstill period was relevant to two other matters. First, it was desirable that the month ofApril should be kept as free as possible of ordinary price increasesso that it would be easier to ensure that tax changes on 1 April werein fact reflected in prices. It would therefore be (necessary toretain the full standstill powers on prices until the end of the extendedstandstill. Secondly, with regard to the deferment of the operativedates of pay settlements, the fairest arrangement seemed to be that,once the original 90 day standstill had ended, all settlements shouldbe deferred for 90 days after their normal operative date, or until31 March, whichever was the earlier. This would mean that theagricultural workers would have to wait until a somewhat later datethan, for example, the National Health Service (NHS) ancillary workers for their increase, they would have had to wait a rathershorter period and would receive a considerably higher increase.The pay standstill would thus end on 31 March and the price standstill on 28 April.The proposals in relation to prices during the second stage were broadly as described to the Cabinet at their previous meeting. Pre-notification of price increases would be limited to large companies;a system of profit control, which would supplement the general control of manufacturers&apos; prices through strictly defined &quot; allowablecosts &quot; and of retailers&apos; prices through gross percentage margins,would be based on the best two years&apos; profits from the last five years.The nationalised industries would be subject to the same criteria for price increases as the private sector, but would not during this stage be allowed to increase prices for the purpose of reducing a deficit.Dividend increases would be limited to 5 per cent. The proposal toreduce the increase due in local authority rents in 1973 had been further considered. A halving of the 50p increase would save 0-3 per cent on the retail price index (RPI) but it would be a breach of thenew &quot; fair rents &quot; policy, which differentiated in favour of the low paid, and it would be very unwelcome to the government&apos;s supporters. It had therefore been decided that it would be preferable to make a further and more substantial increase in theneeds allowance. The 50p increase already announced couldbe raised to  2 - 50 or to  3 - 50. The latter figure wouldinvolve a further burden on public expenditure, but evenan increase of  2-50 would make a considerable impact on the rents paid by those earning up to  35 a week, andwould reduce the RPI by about 0-2 per cent. Private rents were already strictly controlled under existing legislation and the move towards &quot; fair rents &quot; was already phased. There were, therefore, no specific proposals with regard to private rents in the White Paper,but wide powers, covering all types of rents, were contained in thedraft Bill.
As regards pay policy the basic problem had been to find a formula that would make a real impact on inflation, would be fairenough to gain support of public opinion at home and overseas,and would avoid the risk of confrontation with the unions over a wide front. The Cabinet the previous week had felt that a limit for pay increases of 7 per cent of the annual wage bill for the12 months following the normal operative date, which could have resulted in some groups of workers receiving an increase of nearly9^ per cent, plus &quot; wage drift&quot;, would constitute an insufficientreduction compared with the pre-standstill levels. The cabinet had also seen considerable attraction in the idea of expressing the ceiling as a percentage of the wage bill, plus  1 a week per employee.The Ministerial group, after further consideration, had concluded that the best formula would be  1 a week per employee plus 4 percent of the present wage bill (excluding overtime). The distributionwithin the group concerned of this global amount should be left to negotiation between the employers and the unions concerned, butthe Government would stress publicly the importance of givingfavourable treatment to the low-paid within the total. The aimwould then be to reduce the ceiling again in the autumn, havingregard to the level of economic growth which had been achieved.The anomalies which might arise from the first and second stages ofthe policy would be examined by the Pay Board with a view to somecorrective action being taken during the third stage. In the case ofthe Civil Service, the limit for the second stage would apply, but the pay reseach analysis would be continued and would be made availableto the Pay Board in the context of their general review. It was intended to consult the TUC and the CBI further about the desir-ability of including threshold agreements in the policy for the third stage in the autumn. The remaining difference between men&apos;s andwomen&apos;s pay could be narrowed to one-third by the end of 1973,outside the pay limit. The White Paper would also announce theintention to defer the increase in the charge for school meals from12p to 14p which was due to take place on 1 April. It would also need to refer to the problems of speculation in land and excessiverises in house prices, commercial rents and rates, all of which wouldbe important if the Governmenfs policy as a whole was to appearfair and balanced. The policies which he had outlined were intendedto meet the objectives announced at the time of the tripartite discus-sions during the autumn, of sustained economic growth at 5 per cent,of effective measures to counter inflation and of fair treatment of all parties, including particularly consideration of the needs of the low-paid. The attempt had been made to strike the best balance betweenthe conflicting aims of firmness, fairness and simplicity, which were essential if the support of public opinion was to be maintained.In discussion, it was argued that some categories of national health Service (NHS) employees had close links with other groups,and by united industrial action could cause considerable disruption.It was for consideration whether, if the pay of these NHS employeescould be settled for only marginally more than the new pay limits,their case could legitimately be regarded as unique. Alternatively,the earlier proposal on pay, that the pay limit should apply to the
increased amount paid in the 12 months following the normaloperative date, might facilitate a settlement in such cases and mitigate the hardship of deferment. On the other hand, the public were generally expecting that the next phase of pay and price policy would permit only a modest relaxation of the standstill. There were other groups of employees, for example the Northern Ireland building workers, who could make a stronger case for preferential treatmentthan those in the NHS. The suggestion that the pay limit should apply to the increased amount paid in the 12 months following thenormal operative date would have allowed settlements at levels whichwould not be seen as effective in combating inflation, and whichwould have set too high a starting point for the subsequent stage ofthe policy. It would be preferable therefore to make the second stage short, and to ask the Pay Board to examine the resultinganomalies and advise on their treatment in the subsequent stage.The passage in the draft White Paper referring to this intentionmight usefully be strengthened.In further discussion, it was suggested that a policy generally re-stricting prices and incomes would be open to severe criticism if it wasnot seen to deal effectively with the problem of land and house prices,and particularly with the large profits at present secured from the saleof land with planning permission for development. The stepsalready taken to expedite the granting of planning permission wouldmean that many individual cases where large profits had beenobtained would get considerable publicity in the coming months.Such profits were seen by many people as a serious social injustice,and if some remedial action was not taken, there would be publicpressure for still more drastic measures than might at present becontemplated. The White Paper should therefore make it clear thatthe Government were considering additional measures not only tomake more land available for development, but also with regard tothe taxation of profits from land dealings. Some changes in the taxation of land dealings might anyway be necessary as a result ofthe reform of corporation tax. Against this, it was argued that a careful scrutiny of a number of possible measures for the taxation ofland dealings had indicated that they were likely either to increaseland prices or to reduce the availability of land for building purposes.There was therefore a conflict between the desire to penalise excessiveprofits on land dealings, and the need to keep down the price ofhouses. The measures which had been considered would also involve serious problems of valuation and administration, and it wasnot certain that the reform of corporation tax would necessarilyrequire any changes in this field. On the other hand, the conclusionthat higher taxation would inevitably increase land prices might require reconsideration in present circumstances, when the price ofland seemed to be determined primarily by demand. If firmmeasures were taken by the Government now, owners of land suitablefor development would have no reason to expect that they would be relaxed for some time to come, and as the profits to be made were so high, even a relatively high rate of tax might not therefore discourageland being brought forward for development. Other measures atpresent under consideration for improving the availability of land
should also be urgently considered, including, for example, measuresto penalise land hoarding, or to permit compulsory management ofunoccupied office property. Such measures could not be formulated in the time available before the White Paper was published, andsome of them might require legislation for which no time was atpresent allocated in the legislative programme. While there mightbe some risk in committing the Government to specific measuresbefore they had been fully examined, there might however still be considerable advantage in indicating publicly, in the White Paper,that the Government intended, before the next stage of the pay and prices policy came into operation, to bring forward proposals whichwould increase the availability of building land and reduce the extentto which it was possible for people to make disproportionately highprofits from land transactions.In further discussion the following points were made (a) The proposal that individual groups of employees couldreceive pay increases 90 days after their normal operative date wouldmean that some groups, for example the NHS ancillary workers,would obtain increases before the agricultural workers. While thisoutcome might accord with the letter of the undertakings given to theagricultural workers, some Government supporters might be disturbedabout it. It could however be pointed out that the NHS ancillary workers would only qualify for the new pay limit whereas theagricultural workers would still obtain the award determined beforethe standstill. The agricultural workers would anyway get their pay increase no later than the end of the pay standstill on 31 March, andin order to give Parliament an incentive to pass the Counter-InflationBill quickly, it could be indicated that if the Bill was passed before31 March, the standstill would end as soon as it was passed.(b) More detailed points on pay matters, such as the applicationof the pay policy to arbitration awards and the exclusion from the pay limit of improvements in occupational pensions, would beincluded in a section of the Appendix to the White Paper, which wasbeing prepared under the supervision of the Secretary of State for employment. A number of other detailed pay points would also need to be considered urgently, for example claims for improvements in London weighting, and the future of the Review Bodies.(c) A group of Ministers under the chairmanship of the HomeSecretary had considered earlier in the day the statement to be madein the White Paper about the treatment of rates. It should be made clear that although there must be some increases in local government expenditure to provide for the improvement of social and environmental services, the Government had substantially increased the amount of rate support grant in order tokeep down the average increase in rates. arrangements should be announced to monitor increases above the average, andthe Government should reserve the right to require the local author-ities concerned to reconsider their proposals. Such action might, forexample, be appropriate if the local authority had built into itsestimates an excessive rate of inflation. It was possible that some additional provision would need to be added to the Bill in order to empower the Government to take the action proposed.
(d) It would be undesirable to impede the progress to &quot; fairrents &quot; which was a key element in the Governments housing policy.The detailed provision in the Bill dealing with certain consequentialmatters regarding rents in Scotland should therefore be deleted. Apreferable way to deal with the problem of rent increases was to makea substantial increase in the needs allowance used for the calculation of rent rebates and rent allowances. It had been proposed that theprevious increase in the needs allowance of 50p should be raised to 2 - 50. A further increase of  1, to  3 - 50 in all, would cost an extra 10 to  15 million and increase the total cost of the concession to 35 to  40 million. The Government would be vulnerable to criticism if the pay increases permitted under the new policy wereunduly eroded by rent increases; but if the needs allowance were increased by  3 - 50, it would be possible to say that a married localauthority tenant with 2 children earning  35 a week would not pay any more rent even if his weekly income increased by 7 per cent.It would also reduce the retail price index by about 0-3 per cent, andwould particularly benefit the low paid.(e) Any control of business rents would be more appropriatelyadministered by the Housing Ministers than by the Lord ChancellorsDepartment. The Lord Chancellor should not therefore be included as one of the Ministers on whom powers were conferred under the counter-Inflation Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals embodied in the draft White paper and the Counter-Inflation Bill. They agreed that although a generalenabling power to restrict rent increases should be included in theBill, no change should be proposed in the increases taking effect in local authority or private tenancies, and that the increase in theneeds allowance should be raised to  3-50. The White Paper should indicate that the Government intended, before the next stage of the pay and price policy came into operation, to bring forward proposalsfor increasing the availability of building land and reduce the extentto which people could make disproportionately high profits fromland transactions. It should also announce the Governments inten-tion to monitor local authority rate increases and require localauthorities to reconsider their proposals. Urgent consideration should be given to the possible need to incorporate a provision in theBill to deal with this point. The detailed consequential provision inthe Bill regarding Orders about Scottish rent increases should be deleted; and the reference to the Lord Chancellor in Clause 16 of theBill should be omitted. The Home Secretary, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, should arrange for the revision of theWhite Paper in the light of the points made in discussion. TheSecretary of State for Employment should arrange for any necessaryrevision of the Appendix dealing with pay, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, and should also arrange for consideration to begiven to other pay matters which would need to be settled in the lightof the policy in the White Paper. The White Paper and the draftBill should be published on Wednesday 17 January, when he him-self would hold a Press conference and other Ministers would
arrange for the briefing of journalists and other interested bodies.In the meantime, the greatest care should be taken to avoid any premature disclosure of the policy which the Government was about to announce.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister, and invited the ministers concerned to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office16 January, 1973
