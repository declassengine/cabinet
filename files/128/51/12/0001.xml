INDUSTRIALAFFAIRSThe Price and pay Code:ConsultativeDocumentPreviousReference:CM(73) 10thConclusionsX1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wishto record their appreciation of the intensive efforts by the ministers and officials concerned, which had made it possible to publish the consultative Document on the Price and Pay Code on the previous day.    The Document had been well received, although publicopinion had been predictably critical of the lack of full control overfood prices and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) had attacked both the definition of &quot;allowable costs&quot; and the base date from which costs might rank as &quot;allowableThere would inevitably be further criticism of the arrangements for price control;  and these would be encouragedsome extent by recentannouncements of company profit levels.In discussion the following main points were mado -a. There was a growing impression that theGovernment had now accepted that statutory controls over pay and prices would need to be a permanent feature of their policy.    It would be important to take every opportunity to correct this;  and Ministers should be assisted in doing so by the Government amendment to the counter-Inflation Bill which had how been tabled,reinstating a period of three years during which theGovernment would be able to control pay and prices butnot conferring any power to renew these controls by Orderafter March, 1976.    The fact that the life of Part II of theBill would be definitely limited in this way and could notbe renewed without fresh legislation should go far torebut allegations that the Government intended toacquire permanent powers of control.b. The publication of the Consultative Document had done little to clarify the Government1 s intentions about themethod of dealing with the problems of pay differentialsand anomalies, on which the prospects of avoiding an intensification of current industrial action would in partdepend.    It would be important to provide as soon aspossible some indication of action in this context, whichmight help the moderate elements in the unions to regaincontrol of the situation.    On the other hand it would alsobe important to avoid creating the impression that theremoval of anomalies would be the dominant, if not theonly, objective of policy during Stage 3,    It would not be prudent to make a definitive statement on this question until the main policy issues in Stage 3 had been determined.
c.        It would be helpful to Ministers to be supplied withauthoritative statistics illustrating the movement of profitsover recent years, separately for each group of industries,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Government must now seek to obtain the co-operationof the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the CBI in the effectiveimplementation of the Stage 2 policy.    It would be possible tomake it clear publicly that the Pay Board would be expected to make proposals to the Government about the policy for Stage 3, taking into account the treatment of the problems of differentials and ofanomalies, which would inevitably affect the pay limit which couldbe set for that Stage,    The most appropriate time to make astatement of this kind would be the occasion when the terms ofreference of the Pay Board and the names of its Chairman and deputy Chairmen were announced,,    This would be arranged assoon as the necessary details had been settled.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of thePrime Minister1 s summing up of this partof their discussion.C ounte r -InflationPolicyPreviousReference:CM(73) 9thConclusions,Minute 5THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that on theprevious day the Finance and General Purposes Committee of the tuc had rejected pressure for a national strike in protest against theGovernments pay policy by deciding that delegates at the SpecialCongress of trade unions on 6 March should be invited only to endorse the tuc&apos;s plan for countering inflation:  &quot;Economic Folicyand Collective Bargaining in 1973&quot;,    The TUC were likely, however,to offer support, albeit short of financial assistance, to those unionswhich decided to take industrial action;  and they would probablylaunch a campaign against rising prices, particularly of food, andthe introduction of value added tax.BritishRailwaysA potentially dangerous situation appeared to be arising in the pay negotiations between the British Railways Board (BRB) and the associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF).At an informal meeting of the working party on the restructuringof drivers&apos; pay on the previous day the Board had made proposalswhich, by consolidation of bonus payments, would give drivers anincreased basic rate of  33,50 a week, in addition to which therewould be new long-distance mileage payments.    In total these
proposals would cost almost as much as the whole of thepermissible pay increase for ASLEF members under the Stage pay limit.    In addition, however, the BRB were that day beginningnegotiations with the three railway unions about the annual pay increase due on lS[march .    ASLEF were very unlikely to agree&apos;/ that the increase proposed by the Board during the restructuringmeeting should be offset again.it the amount to which their members would otherwise be entitled under the annual pay settlement,,    Equally, the other two unions, the National Union of railwaymen and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, wouldbe concerned that their members should not be offered in totalless than  1 plus 4 per cent per head as a means of meeting theadditional ASLEF claim on restructuring within the overall pay limit.    In these circumstances there was a risk that, in their desire to avoid further industrial action by ASLEF, the BRB, while not formally offering them more than the pay limit allowed, mightcreate an expectation that this would be possible, perhaps as theresult of a reference to the Pay Board,    This would have repercussions elsewhere and could prejudice the position asregards the Stage 3 pay policy.Gas IndustryIndustrial action in the gas industry was continuing at about thesame level.    There were renewed threats, so far unfulfilled,that supply would be discontinued in certain regions;;  and thenumbers laid off in industry remained constant at between 9* 000and 10, 000.    A national gas strike did not at present appear likely;but the unions were seeking a specific improvement in the payoffer or a guarantee, which could not be given, that the Pay board would reallS an early decision on their claim for treatment as aspecial case.British Road Half the British Road services drivers on strike in the MidlandsServices. * v     had now resumed work;  and the remainder would decide at a(Wrvevw IfAht^yt -CM Y$)    meeting that day whether to follow their example.Fords Although the unions representing the workers at Fords had rejected an improved pay offer during negotiations on the previous day, the unofficial industrial action due to start on 1 March was now unlikely to be on a national basis.    A long campaign of selective stoppages and overtime bans now appeared more likelyif the negotiations broke down that day.    The management, whohad offered improvements in the pension arrangements^ were continuing to comply with the Stage 2 pay lirnito
In discussion the following main points were made -a.        If the ASLEF strike took place, it would affectLondon Transport Underground services as well.    Between600? 000 and 900, 000 commuters using both British rail and the Underground services would have to makealternative travelling arrangements.    The MetropolitanPolice were ready to make their customary dispositionsto deal with the situation.    These included the introductionof special clearways on main traffic routes, the free useof parking meters and the opening of car parks in theRoyal Parks.    The Chairman of London Transport had stated that, although it seemed probable that london transport would be able to bring a case against ASLEFin the National Industrial Relations Court, on the grounds of unfair industrial practice, there would be no point in doing so.    This might be interpreted as criticism of theineffectiveness of the Industrial Relations Act.National health service AncillaryWorkersb. The National Health Service ancillary workersappeared to have selected one hospital in each of thelarger towns as the main target for their selective strike action starting cn 1 March,    They had undertaken, however,,to provide the minimum services necessary in order toavoid a risk to Uie at all hospitals, provided that theauthorities made no attempt to use voluntary labour.Water Industryc. There now appeared to be a risk of unofficial strikes involving three or four water authorities on 9 March,the contingency planning arrangements in the water industry were under review by the Civil Contingencies Unit.Civil Serviced. The Cabinet1 s discussion about industrial action by civil Service unions is recorded separately,ill-   &quot;0 the PRIME MINISTER, summing up/the discussion, said that theSecretary of State for Employment should confirm urgently withthe BRB that they did not intend to make a pay offer to ASLEFwhich, taking account of both the proposals on the restructuringof drivers1 pay and the annual pay claim, would in total amount toja^more than the ASLEF members would be entitled to claim underthe Stage 2 pay policy.
The cabinet. Took note, with approval, (ofjhie pa*$)of the Prime Minister1 s summing up/of their discussion, A.3,        Invited the Secretary of State for employment to confirm that the British Railways Board wouldnot prejudice the Government1 s pay policy, particularly by offering the Associated Society of locomotive engineers and Firemen pay increases which in total would exceed the Stage 2 limit.
2. THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, as requested by the Cabinet at their meeting on 22 February, he had discussed with the Inner London Members of Parliament theamendment to the Counter-Inflation Bill which had already beenput down by Mr Tugendhat MP.    This amendment, which was inthe form of a new clause, would increase from  400 to  600 in greater London and from  200 to  300 elsewhere the rateable value(RV) up to which unfurnished accommodation was subject to rent control.    The Inner London Members had not been impressed bythe Governments contention that this would distort the free market for high RV unfurnished rented accommodation, since they maintained that a free market no longer existed in practice andthat in any event the Government were proposing to control nearly all other prices.    They accepted that in the long run accommodation of this kind might virtually disappear in the centre of London.    Theyhad also argued that the tenants of furnished accommodationpresented a separate problem, which had always been dealt with by different means, and that acceptance of their amendment wouldnot necessitate further measures for the protection of suchtenants.    It was clear, therefore, that Mr Tugendhat would not beprepared to withdraw his amendment;  and it would probablycommand the votes of an appreciable number of the government&apos;s supporters.    If the Government opposed it, they might seem to bedefending the activities of some of the more dip reputable propertydevelopment companies!  and the political damage which theywould sustain would be compounded if, as seemed probable, theamendment, after being defeated in the House of Commons, were introduced and carried in the House of Lords.In discussion, it was emphasised that genuine hardship was beingsuffered by an appreciable proportion of the tenants of high RVunfurnished accommodation.    The original choice of  400 as thelevel of RV at which protection ceased had been largely arbitrary;and no major question of principle would seem to be raised by adecision to increase that level, since it could reasonably bemaintained that at the time when the  400 limit was introduced ithad represented the RV above which a genuinely free marketexisted but that the limit was now considerably higher and somecorresponding adjustment was therefore required.    It could alsobe argued that the rents of unregulated tenancies were likely tohave risen by disproportionately greater amounts than other rents and that it was therefore not unreasonable, in the context of theGovernments counter ^inflationary policies, to give special protection to the tenants of such accommodation6    Moreo-ver,Mr Tugendhats amendment did not imply more than extending theprinciple of fair rents, which already applied to the tenants ofunfurnished accommodation with a RV of less than  400 in London,to a small additional group of tenants.    It would no doubt be
necessary, however, to provide that rents which were already abovethe fair rent level would not be allowed to rise further.    the tenants concerned would thus not be treated better than othertenants, who in any case were much more likely to benefit, fromthe large increase which the Government had recently agreed inthe needs allowance used in calculating rent rebates and allowances.    It was true that the tenants of furnished accomodation would not be receiving a comparable additionalmeasure of protection; but previous Governments, of whateverpolitical complexion, had always seen good grounds for makingdifferent provisions for the two categories of tenants.    Moreover,there was no doubt that, if the tenants of furnished accommodationwere given the benefit of rent control and security of tenure, the availability of this type of accommodation would at once be reducedbecause landlords would no longer judge that it provided aneconomic return.On the other hand, it was suggested that the number of tenants ofunfurnished accommodation who genuinely needed help was small.Moreover, they were comparatively rich;  and if the government appeared to be helping them while not giving comparable assistanceto the poor, they would lay themselves open to severe criticismfor acting inequitably and for failing to observe the spirit of theirown counter -inflationary policies.    In particular, they would be criticised for providing no relief for the tenants of furnished accomodation, who frequently suffered acute hardship and had prior claim to assistance if homelessness, which was steadily increasing, was not to become a scandal.    But to be stampededinto precipitate measures of control in these cases might onlyaggravate an already grave social evil by provoking an immediatecontraction in the supply of furnished accommodation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet faced two problems - first, what measures were necessaryin order to alleviate the hardship caused by the conjunction of a rapid increase in rents with the strict limitation of incomesnecessitated by counter-inflationary policies;  second, what action would suffice to secure the whole-hearted support for these policies of the Inner London Members and of the Governments supporters in the House of Lords.    The Cabinet agreed that, considered in isolation, the political situation required the Government to provide some protection for tenants, at least during Stage 2; but they hadnot been able to agree on the scope and nature of that protection.In particular, it was not clear whether, for the tenants ofunfurnished accommodation, the right upper limits for controlwere RVs of  600 and  400 or whether some rather lowerfigures might be preferable.    Nor was the initial duration of themeasures clear.    Should they, for example, be limited to Stage 2;7
or should they be coterminous with the Counter-Inflation Bill?Further thought should also be given to the extent of the probablereaction if a measure of protection was given to the tenants ofunfurnished accommodation but no corresponding assistance was provided for the tenants of furnished accommodation.    If it was found necessary to extend protection to the latter also, what formshould this take and for what initial period should it be operative?These were matters to which the Cabinet must return as rapidly as possible;  and *he Secretary of State for the Environment should circulate further proposals for consideration in the following week.In the meantime, the Minister for Housing and Construction should indicate, in that afternoon&apos;s debate on Mr Tugendhafs amendment,that the Government recognised that the circumstances to which itwas addressed constituted a serious problem, to which they were giving urgent consideration, and that, if Mr Tugendhat would withdraw his proposed new clause, the necessary steps would betaken in the House of Lords, with effect from 27 February, to giveeffect to whatever remedial action might be found to be appropriate.A statement to this effect would constitute a virtual commitment to introduce measures of some kind; but it should suffice to hold the position while further consideration was given to the leastdamaging form which they might take.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Minister for Housing and construction to be guided, in the debate on mr Tugendhafs amendment, by the prime minister s summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Secretary of State for the environment to circulate, as a matter of urgency, a further memorandum on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office27 February 19738

Such picketing as there had beenseemed to have been conducted in an orderly manner.    It wasdisturbing, however, that statements by the unions that theGovernment had broken their pay agreement with the non-industrial civil Service and that civil servants2 pay had fallen 20 per centbehind that of similar workers outside the Civil Service were notbeing countered.    When the National Staff Side were given an assurance in March, 1971, that the Government endorsed theprinciples of pay research it had been made clear to the Staff Sidethat implementation of those principles was subject to anyrequirements prescribed by an overriding national policy of general application.    The figure of 20 per cent appeared to have been basedon a comparison with the Wages Index; but the relevant comparisonwith outside rates, on the basis of pay research, would not be knownuntil the processing of the evidence had been completed.The Cabinet -Invited the Lord Privy Seal to take urgent stepsto counter union propaganda about the pay of thenon-industrial Civil Service.Cabinet Office27 February 1973
