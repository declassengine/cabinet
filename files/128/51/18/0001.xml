INDUSTRIALAFFAIRSBritishRailwaysBoardPreviousReference:CM(73) 16thConclusions,Minute 41.    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat the meeting on the previous day of the working party ofthe British Railways Board (BRB) which was reviewing thedrivers&apos; pay structure had been conducted in a more favourableatmosphere than might have been expected; and the associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) had accepted that progress had been made.    It would now benecessary to await the outcome of the negotiations on the annualpay claim, which were due to be resumed on the following day,in order to attempt to assess whether the conflict between ASLEFand the other two rail unions about the distribution of the amountof money which the BRB would be entitled to devote to pay increases under the Pay Code could be amicably resolved, or whether ASLEFwere likely to resume industrial action.The GasIndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 16thConclusions,Minute 4THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY said that, despite continuedmilitancy in some areas, there had now been a gradual return towork by gas manual workers, pending the outcome of the ballot,which was expected by the following weekend.    It had unfortunatelyproved necessary for the British Gas Corporation (BGC) to cutoff supplies to 45, 000 domestic consumers in the West Midlandsbecause of continued militancy in that region;  but they had succeeded in doing so without having to ask the Government to invoke Emergency Powers.National HealthServiceAncillaryWorkersPreviousReference:CM(73) 16thConclusions,Minute 4THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thatat his meeting with the unions representing the National health service (NHS) ancillary workers on the previous day the unions had adopted a moderate attitude.    They had agreed to consider further the possibility of making an approach to the Pay board for consideration as a special case during Stage 3 of the pay policy;and they had seemed attracted by the suggestion that more usemight be made of the existing agreement which enabledproductivity bonus schemes to be implemented.    They had made it clear, however, that they would prefer that any approach to the pay Board should initially be made by the management, and thatthey would wish to discuss with the Trades Union Congress (TUC)the implications for the tuc&apos;s pay policy of any action which they took in this context.    Meanwhile, 90 per cent of the normalhospital services were still being provided as a result of the exceptional efforts of the hospital administrators and the nursingstaff.    In cases where the local hospital Management Committeesconsidered that essential services could not be maintained andapproaches to the unions did not succeed in inducing a moreco-operative attitude by the strikers, the Health Departments
were authorising the use of volunteers.    On balance, however,it remained true that to use volunteers on a wider basis than was absolutely necessary in order to maintain essential services would be liable to have adverse repercussions on theattitude of the NHS ancillary workers generally.The CoalIndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 16thConclusions,Minute 4THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY said that the ExecutiveCommittee of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) had decided to conduct a ballot of their members on the desirabilityof taking industrial action in support of their pay claim.    Theterms of qusstions asked in the ballot, which were not undulyprovocative, reflected the fact that there had been no greatenthusiasm on the part of the Executive Committee for strike action.    The result of the ballot should be known by the end ofMarch.Civil Service THE LORD PRIVY SEAL reported on industrial action in theUnions Civil Service.    His report and the Cabinets discussion are recorded separately.previous reference:CM(73) 16thConclusions,Minute national Union THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCEof Teachers said that teachers in London belonging to the National Union of teachers (NUT) were due to strike again on the following day in support of their claim for an increased London allowance.TUC one-daystoppagePreviousReference:CM(73) 16thConclusions,Minute 4THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theFinance and General Purposes Committee of the TUC intendedto consider on the following day their recommendation to theGeneral Council of the TUC about the form and timing of theproposed one-day national protest and stoppage.    The attitudeof the General Council at their meeting on 23 March wouldpernaps depend to a significant degree on the progress made inresolving the dispute with the NHS ancillary workers.    the outcome of the NUM ballot would also be influenced by develop-ments on these issues.
In discussion the following main points were made -a. Continuing efforts should be made to securethe maximum possible publicity for the Governmentspay policy and to ensure that the facts of the variousdisputes were as widely known and understood aspossible.    In particular, it would be desirable tocontinue to seek to counter exaggerated reports aboutthe adverse effects of the industrial action by the NHSancillary workers.    Particular efforts should also bemade to explain the facts at issue in the miners&apos; pay negotiations while the ballot was taking place.    Thefacts about the miners1 leave entitlement and their claim for an extra week&apos;s leave should be emphasised,preferably by the National Coal Board, who should also consider the desirability of sending a letter to allmineworkers setting out the facts about the dispute.b. It would also have been desirable to issue animmediate reply to the claim reported in the Press onthe previous day that a study made at the London school of Economics had shown that, taking account of the likelyincrease in the cost of living, few workers with large families would be in an improved financial position as aresult of pay increases in accordance with the pay limit.There should be an immediate examination of the resultsof the study, which did not take account of the possibility that the lowest paid workers might receive more than  1 plus 4 per cent or of the recent decision to exempt allfoodstuffs from Value Added Tax or of the fact that anincreased amount of overtime was being worked.    On theother hand, the fact that earnings appeared to have remained static in recent months suggested that carefulconsideration should be given to the factual basis of anyreply to the conclusions reached in the report.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theSecretary of State for Social Services should consider urgentlythe best means of enabling public opinion to see the NHS dispute in a more correct perspective.    In paying tribute to the outstand-ing work of the administrative and nursing staff in hospitals, he might take the opportunity to set out the facts on the pay disputeand on the effects of industrial action.    Similarly, the Ministerfor Industry should seek an opportunity to inform the public of thefacts about the dispute in the coal industry, emphasisingparticularly that the miners were now able to take threeconsecutive weeks&apos; leave.    The Chancellor of the exchequer should arrange for urgent consideration to be given to thereport about the likely financial situation of workers with large3
families under the Stage 2 policy and to the possibility ofcountering the unfortunate impression which this report had created.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Ministers concerned to proceed accordingly.4
STEEL PRICES      2. The Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry (CP(73) 33), to which was annexed aNote by the Minister for Industry about proposals by the british steel Corporation (BSC) to increase steel prices.    They also had before them copies of a minute from the Home Secretary to thePrime Minister, dated 14 March, reporting the discussion of thesame subject by the Ministerial Committee on Counter-inflationary measures on 13 March, together with copies of a minute from theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to the Prime Ministermaintaining that deferment of an increase in prices was not practicable but that some abatement of it on Counter-inflationarygrounds was desirable, provided that the BSC would put thisforward on their own account and would not claim that it was a consequence of Government pressure.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY saidthat, under the Treaty of Paris, we were obliged not to hold theprice of steel products below economic levels.    The BSCssteel prices were already 15 per cent below European levels;the Commission of the European Communities had recentlyreminded us of our Treaty obligations; and we had promised that,when the pay and prices standstill ended, the Corporation^pricing policy would be free from control by the Government.Specific provision had been made for this situation in theGovernments Consultative Document on the Price and Pay Code(Cmnd. 5247).    The Corporation now estimated that, in order toobtain a realistic return of 5 or 6 per cent on capital, they would need to raise delivered prices by an average of 13. 5 per cent from1 May,   thus achieving an increase of 11.6 per cent in realisedprices.    If they were not permitted to do so, there was a danger that one of their European competitors would bring a case against them in the European Court, with a good chance of success.Domestically, their present artificially low prices were creatingserious financial difficulties for the private sector steel companies,whose prices had necessarily to be subject to the same constraints;and the possibility that one of the private companies in this country might ask the European Court to compel them to adopt higher prices could not be ruled out.    The disparity between bsc&apos;s steel prices and those of European companies resulted in a considerable proportion of bsc&apos;s production being exported, while the realisation by British steel users that an increase in prices couldnot be long delayed was leading to an undesirable degree ofstockpiling.   Both these factors were aggravating the existingshortage of steel for domestic users.    The bsc&apos;s proposals hadbeen discussed with the Steel Consumers&apos; Council, who had indicated that they would prefer an immediate increase of8 per cent in realised prices, followed by a second increase of5 per cent after 3 months.    But, although this might go some way5
towards holding the position as far as our assurance to theEuropean Communities was concerned, it would have littleimpact on the present stockpiling problem.    For these reasons the Corporation should be allowed to implement their proposed increases in full from 1 May.    Some members of the ministerial committee on Counter-Inflationary Measures, however, had felt that immediate increases of the order proposed would have aserious effect on the Stage 2 pay and prices policy and should therefore be postponed for some months.In discussion it was suggested that there was no reason why BSCprices should be raised to match those prevailing in Europe ifthe British industry was more competitive.    Although weshould clearly be open to criticism if the Corporation were tosell steel within the Community at a loss, it was difficult to see how prices which yielded a positive return on capital, even if thereturn was below the 5 to 6 per cent level thought appropriate bythe BSC, could be represented as involving a subsidy in breach ofour Treaty obligations.    To allow BSC to raise prices beyondthe absolute minimum necessary to meet the assurances givento the Community would be damaging to our Counter-inflationarypolicy and would be widely interpreted as a direct consequenceof our membership of the Community.    Our main objective atthis stage should be to convince the European Commission andthe BSCJs competitors that some genuine movement towardshigher prices was being made; but this should be effected on thebasis of the minimum increases which were needed in order toprovide the Corporation with a current trading surplus.    Theyhad indicated that increases of about 8 per cent in realised prices would be required to enable them to break even, without makinga contribution to their public dividend capital.    But, although they were anxious not to prejudice the Stage 2 policy, they were also concerned about the prospect that their pricing policy migntbe exposed to attack in the European Court.  It was unlikely,therefore, that they would be prepared to defend any level of increase which involved this risk as one which they had freelyadopted on commercial grounds while the Government had themselves expressly said that they would not intervene.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabito&amp;t-agreed that increases of the order proposed by the bsc could severely damage the Governmenfs pay and pricespolicy.    They therefore considered that only the minimumincrease in prices which could be regarded as consistent withour assurances to the European Communities should be made from 1 May, leaving open the possibility of a further increase ata later date, preferably when Stage 2 of the pay and pricespolicy had ended.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should6
consider further, in consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry, the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and the United Kingdom Ambassador to the European Communities,the level of the initial increase which would be appropriate in thelight of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.    The Secretary of State for trade and Industry should then seek the agreement of the Chairmanof the BSC to the suggestion that the increase thus agreed should be announced by the Corporation as their own commercialdecision.    The outcome should be reported to the Cabinet.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry, the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and the United Kingdom Ambassador tothe European Communities, to consider further thelevel of increase which should be made in the prices charged by the British Steel Corporation from 1 May,as indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.3.      Invited the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry to discuss with the Chairman of the british steel Corporation the public presentation of the levelof increase decided as a result of the furtherconsideration by Ministers, as indicated in the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up.
reorganisation of THE NUCLEARDESIGN ANDCONSTRUCTIONINDUSTRYPreviousReference:CM(73) 15thConclusions,Minute 73. The Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry (CP(73) 34) about there organisation of the nuclear design and construction industry.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRYsaid that he had now discussed with the General ElectricCompany (G.C), the Electricity Council, the central electricity Generating Board (CEGB), the United kingdom atomic Energy Authority (sea), the two existing nucleardesign and construction consortia, Sir Arnold Hall(Hawker Siddeley) and Lord McFadzean (British InsulatedCallendar Cables) the proposal to establish a single nucleardesign and construction company in the private sector, led by G.C.    He had outlined to them the alternatives of amajority shareholding by G.C and a minority shareholdingcoupled with an agreement which would give G.C fullmanagerial authority.    He had also explained to them that under either alternative the company would be required to operate within the context of the Governments nuclearstrategy, as recommended by the Nuclear Power advisory board; that the Government would reserve certain rights to themselves, in Drder to safeguard, in particular, openpurchasing and international links;  and that they would wishto secure the participation of other companies.    TheElectricity Council, the CEGB and the sea had confirmedtheir view that G.C were the only company at presentcapable of leading the new organisation.    The electricity authorities favoured the maximum commitment of GECsresources; but the sea believed that a minority share-holding by G.C would be more acceptable to the rest of theindustry.    Most of the other industrial interests accepted,with some misgiving, the need for a single powerfulcompany to replace the existing consortia; and, if managementcontrol was to be vested in G.C, they preferred that thisshould be effected by a majority shareholding.    The mainconcern of other firms related to the purchasing arrange-ments which were envisaged.    But, although they doubted the efficacy of an open purchasing policy, they recognisedthat it was an inescapable consequence of a strong, unifiedorganisation.    He himself believed that the risks could be mitigated, since in addition to the Governments reservedrights, there would be opportunity for other firms to be directly involved in the new company and the CEGB would retain freedom to place direct orders for parts of the system with outside contractors.8
G.C themselves were reluctant to share their interest in thenew company with other firms; but they were fully aware ofthe objections, on both political and industrial grounds, whichwould be raised if they were to assume full control.    Thenegotiations had accordingly developed on the basis &apos;.hat GECwould take a 50 per cent holding;   the Government wouldprobably take 15 per cent (through the sea);  and the balanceof 35 per cent would be offered to other firms, subject tocertain conditions, including a provision that their sharesshould be held in a group.    The new company!s capital wouldprobably amount to  10 million issued and fully paid.    GECwould nominate   the chairman of the main Board; and the deputy chairman might appropriately represent the jointinterests of the other private firms.    For purposes of day today management the new company would operate through a wholly owned subsidiary, whose chairman would be the chairmanof the main Board.    G.C would supervise the subsidiary^operations and would be paid for services provided.    Allshareholders would initially be asked to participate in jointand several guarantees although some of them, having regardto their limited participation, might be unwilling to accept the substantial risks involved and it might in the event prove necessary for the Government to underwrite guarantees beyondthe size of their own shareholding.In discussion there was general concurrence on the structureproposed for the new company, provided that the cost of the government&apos;s shareholding and of GECs management serviceswas met from within existing public expenditure provisions.    Itwould also be desirable to ensure that the interests ofcomponent manufacturers who were not members of the existingconsortia and were outside the new company would not be over-looked, since several thousand jobs might be at stake.    Thepossibility that guarantees beyond the size of their shareholdingmight have to be underwritten by the Government rather than byGEC, who could expect the major part of the company1 s profits,gave some cause for concern.    On the other hand some of the minority shareholders might not unreasonably prove to be unwilling to accept the contingent liability for guarantees whichmight amount to 40 times their stake in a company over whoseoperations they would have relatively little control; and itwas equally unreasonable to expect G.C to accept a correspondingliability beyond the extent of their own shareholding, to whichthey had been confined by the Governmenfs stipulation thatminority interests should participate in the new company.9
In further discussion it was suggested that, although there might bo both practical and presentational advantages in arranging for the Government to be represented on the proposedNuclear Power Advisory Board by a single spokesman, itmight be no less important to ensure that the Board&apos;scomposition adequately reflected the interests of the various departments concerned in its operation, particularly asregards scientific and regional policies and the control ofpublic expenditure.    It was also for consideration whethera Ministerial chairman might be preferable to an independent chairman drawn from industry.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved in principle the proposed structure for the.new nuclear design and construction company.    In the lightof the views which had been expressed the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry should now complete Ms discussions with G.C and the other interests involved; and he shouldalso discuss further with the Ministers concerned both theterms of an early statement to Parliament and the composition of the Nuclear Power Advisory Board.The Cabinet -1.      Approved in principle the proposals setout in CP(73) 34 for the establishment of a nuclear design and construction company in theprivate sector, led by the General ElectricCompany.2.      Invited the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry -i..      in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Defence, the Home Secretary, theLord President and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, to agree the terms of an early statement to Parliament outlining the basis on which the company was to be established;ii.       in consultation with the Prime Minister,the Chancellor of the Excheuqer, the Secretaryof State for Defence and the Lord Privy Seal, toconsider further the composition of the proposedNuclear Power Advisory Board.Cabinet Office20 March 1973
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NOCABINETINDUSTRIALAFFAIRSCivil ServicePreviousReference:CM (73)16thConclusions,Minute confidential annex cm(73) 17th Conclusions, Minute 1Tuesday 20 March 1973 at 10. 30 am the LORD PRIVY SEAL said that industrial action by theCivil and Public Services Association (CPSA) was continuingon a selective basis in various Departments; but it was now on a declining scale.    The reports of the impact of industrial action by CPSA members employed by the Civil aviation authority apps^sadtto be exaggerated;  only limited inconvenienceshould be caused to airline passengers.    The pressure forfurther industrial action aeemedr*to be decreasing; and it was probably unlikely that there would be more than isolatedinstances after the Counter-Inflation Bill had received theRoyal Assent.    The National Staff Side had hitherto refusedto discuss the pay increases which fell due to be paid to the non-industJrisxi Giv&amp;L J5&amp;a*!ff e&amp;   under the pay policy with effect from 1 April.    The evidence so far provided by pay researchindicated that, on the basis of comparability, the percentage increases which would in normal circumstances have been dueto the lowest paid members of the non-industrial Civil service would be smaller than those which would have been due to thehigher and better paid grades.In discussion it was noted that younger Civil Servants were finding it increasingly necessary to supplement their existingsalaries by taking additional work outside their normal officialhours.    In so far as some of them might be employed onsensitive work, the potential security risk involved should bekept in mind.The Cabinet -Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs and the Lord Privy seal to consider whether there was any risk that security might be endangered by the tendency ofthe lowest paid members of the public service to seek supplementary employment elsewhere.Cabinet Office21 March 1973
