ParliamentaryAffairsImmigrationRulesPreviousReference:CM (73) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3EuropeanCommunities:debates on DraftInstrumentsPreviousReference:CM (72) 58thConclusions,Minute 1Anti-Discrimination(No. 2) BillCONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet were informed that the Opposition favoured asingle debate dealing with both sets of Immigration Rules. Theywould agree that part of one of their Supply days should be used inorder to ensure adequate time for debate at a reasonable hour; andit was suggested that this should be arranged from about 8.00 p.m.onwards on a day during the week beginning 19 February. On theother hand the Government had been at considerable pains to meetthe wishes of their supporters by tabling two separate sets of Rules;and the earlier criticism might be revived if both sets were nowdealt with in a single debate. Moreover, the governments supporters had attached importance to the deferment of consider-ation of the Rules dealing with Commonwealth citizens to the latestpossible date in order to allow ample time for information to beprovided about the outcome of consultations with commonwealth governments. There might therefore be advantage in deferring anydebate until somewhat later.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Home Secretary and the Chief Whip, to review the proposed arrangements for Parliamentary consider-ation of the Immigration Rules.It was reported that there were increasing demands from theOpposition for Parliamentary debates on certain draft instruments of the European Economic Community (e.c.). Pending the reportof the ad hoc Select Committee which was at present considering what provision should be made for the Parliamentary scrutiny of draft e.c. subordinate legislation, there was no scope for consider-ation other than by way of a debate on the Floor of the House; andit would be undesirable to seek to hasten completion of the SelectCommittee&apos;s report in advance of the establishment of the ScrutinyCommittee and the Merits Committee recommended in the reportof the Joint Committee on Delegated Legislation (the BrookeCommittee). In the meantime, it might be desirable to accede tothe demand for debates on one or two draft instruments.The Cabinet were informed that, following the refusal by the speaker to allow the closure motion after a debate of If hours duringthe previous week on the Anti-Discrimination (No. 2) Bill introduced by Mr. William Hamilton mp, it was now proposed to complete theSecond Reading debate during the following week by using half a supply day provided by the Opposition. Owing to the strength of feeling in the House and among women&apos;s organisations in thecountry at large, it had been impossible for the Leader of the house to adopt a wholly negative attitude on this issue following the speakers refusal of the closure motion. It was true that the use of opposition time for the further consideration of Private Members&apos;legislation upon which no decision had been reached during theParliamentary time normally available for it might establish a
OverseasPensions Billdangerous precedent, which would no doubt be noted by back-benchers on both sides of the House. But to decline to meet theOpposition^ proposal to use some of the time at their disposal forthis purpose would on this occasion have resulted merely in a repetition of the situation which arose when the closure motion was refused; and in practice there seemed no acceptable alternative towhat was now proposed.In discussion it was pointed out that the Bill Was highly unsatis-factory as it stood, even though the Government did not object to itsunderlying objectives; and there must be doubt whether it wascapable of amendment. It was desirable that its inadequacies shouldbe clearly brought out in the course of debate. Amendments wouldin any event be difficult in advance of the publication of the reportof the House of Lords Select Committee which was at presentconsidering Baroness Seear&apos;s Bill. It was therefore important that,if the Bill received a Second Reading, its Committee Stage shouldbe delayed long enough to enable it to be amended in the lightof the Select Committee&apos;s report. If it could not be adequatelyamended, it would have to be blocked at a later stage.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, despite the risk of an undesirable precedent,there seemed to be no practical alternative to ensuring the Parliamen-tary time was made available for the bill&apos;s Second Reading. this could be done either by accepting the Opposition^ offer of part ofa Supply day or by providing Government time. The Cabinet had concluded that the first course was the less objectionable. It wouldbe important, however, to ensure that, after the Bill had receivedits Second Reading, it was either suitably amended in the light ofthe report of the House of Lords Select Committee or, if that proved impossible, blocked at a later stage.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord President ofthe Council to proceed accordingly.It was reported that the Government had been defeated in theHouse of Lords on a provision in the Overseas Pensions Bill dealingwith pensions for members of the Armed Forces who had served in aden. The policy implications were at present being examined; butthere seemed little prospect that the decision reached by the House ofLords could be reversed at a later stage.EconomicAffairsCounter-InflationaryPoliciesPreviousReference:CM (72) 56thConclusions,Minute 1CONFIDENTIAL2. The Cabinet were informed that publicity for the Govern-menfs counter-inflationary policies had in the main been effectivebut that increasing difficulty was being found in reconciling the needfor a firm and positive presentation of the Governmenfs broadobjectives with the avoidance of pronouncements which mightexacerbate industrial disputes or encourage militancy. This was a genuine dilemma; but it must not be allowed to diminish the impetusof the campaign to secure public acceptance of the policies con-
cerned. It was important, therefore, that all Ministers should includeappropriate material in their speeches and should emphasise that none of the Governments social programmes could succeed unlessinflation was contained. The main objectives were to explain boththe necessity and the fairness of the counter-inflationary policy andto stress the Governments determination to secure the enforcement of the necessary measures, which now had a statutory foundation.The increases in the prices of fresh foods presented particular diffi-culty; and it was very important both to emphasise that these were caused by world conditions and to develop the very strong arguments against the use of subsidies. It would be useful to indicate that therewas no reason to suppose that prices would continue indefinitely torise at the same rate as recently-although the argument would haveto be presented with care, since some limited further increase seemedinevitable. It might also assist in enlisting the support of moderate opinion in the trade unions to indicate, at some appropriate point,that the Government did not exclude the possibility of re-examining the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act after it had been in practical operation for a reasonable period.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that a verypositive line should be taken in presenting the nature of, and thereasons for, the Governments counter-inflationary policy and instressing its essential fairness. The aim should be to rally allmoderate opinion, including opinion in the trade unions, behind theGovernment. In relation to particular industrial disputes, however,it would be important to avoid any pronouncement which might beregarded as provocative. Ministers had an essential part to play inthis context and should seek out every opportunity for publiclyexplaining and justifying the Governments policy. In view of the impending risk of further industrial disputes, it might be preferable that Ministers of the Department of Employment should play onlya relatively minor part in this campaign and that the main burdenof deploying the arguments in the case of the nationalised industries should be carried by Ministers of the Departments of the Environ-ment and of Trade and Industry.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the Governor ofthe Bank of England, Sir Leslie 0&apos;Brien, who reached the age of 65that day, intended to retire on 30 June. He would be succeeded byMr. Gordon Richardson.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he wasabout to leave on a visit to Nigeria, Senegal and Liberia. He attachedparticular importance to the discussions which he hoped to holdwith the Head of the Federal Military Government of Nigeria,-24B*
General Gowon. The situation in Africa was disquieting. tension between Zambia and Rhodesia was engaging the attention of anumber of African countries. The continued presence of Libyantroops in Uganda was a cause of concern. Nigeria retained a con-siderable influence in the continent; and he hoped to persuadeGeneral Gowon to use this in a constructive way. He would alsoseek clarification of the Nigerian Governments intentions inconnection with an &quot; indigenisation programme &quot; which they weresaid to be considering, since this might have serious implications forforeign investment in that country.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.The primeministers visit to theUnited Statesof AmericaSECRET4. The Prime Minister said that he had had a very successfulmeeting with the President of the United States, Mr. Nixon, in washington in the previous week. The President had expressedappreciation of our attitude in refusing to associate the UnitedKingdom with other countries whose Governments had publiclycondemned the resumption of United States bombing of north vietnam, which had in fact not only brought the war in Vietnam toan end but had also demonstrated the determination of the UnitedStates Government not to abandon their allies. Having forced theNorth Vietnamese Government to a settlement, the President was now determined to seek to ensure that it was honoured, not least by offering them substantial economic aid as an inducement to refrain from further aggression. The United States Government had not as yet been able to give much thought to the functions of the Inter-national Conference on Vietnam, apart from its role in endorsingthe settlement. They appeared to accept our view, however, that itwould not serve as an instrument for &quot; guaranteeing the end of thewar and maintaining the peace &quot; and that we should endeavour to attach this responsibility, so far as possible, to the Secretary Generalof the United Nations, Dr. Waldheim, in his mediatory capacity.His visit to Washington had coincided with the beginning of therenewed strain on the dollar. President Nixon had been critical ofthe relatively leisurely approach of other countries to the questionof international monetary reform. He had also been concerned about the attitude of the European Economic Community to inter-national trade; and, although the United States deficit of $6 billionon current account, which was one cause of the fall in the dollar,was attributable to Europe to only a small extent, it was important,if we were to avoid the inclusion of unduly restrictive provisions inthe forthcoming United States trade legislation, that the community should not be seen to be adopting too rigid a policy in this matter.We must also use the dollar crisis to persuade other countries toadopt a more active approach to the question of monetary reform.
President Nixon was under great pressure in the United StatesSenate to reduce the level of United States forces in Europe. he hoped that he would be able to resist this if he should show thatthe current exchanges with the Soviet Government in the StrategicArms Limitation Talks, in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and in the discussions about Mutualand Balanced Force Reductions offered continuing promise of a progressive relaxation of tension. In general, it was clear that,although he had decided to defer his projected visit to Europe untilthe latter part of the year, he attached a high priority to Europeanaffairs.The discussions had included a reference to the various possi-bilities which might be open to us to sell aircraft to China and toco-operate with China in their local assembly and part manufacture.Some of these transactions might require the approval of the Co-ordinating Committee (COCOM); and it had been agreed that wewould have further discussions with the United States Administrationabout the COCOM rules. There had also been some discussion ofthe problem of energy supplies, to which the United States Govern-ment, like ourselves, were giving increasing attention.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.CONFIDENTIALEuropean 5.   The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that theCommnniry meetings of the Councils of Ministers of the Economic CommunityAffairs an(j Euratom on 5 February had in the main been concerned withrelatively minor matters. The principal decisions had been to agreethe mandate to the Commission for the negotiation of a free trade area between the Community and Norway and to settle a four-year programme for the Euratom Joint Research Centre. In the comingweeks, however, the Community would turn to more important issues. These included their policy towards the countries of theMediterranean, which was of considerable importance to ourrelations with the United States; the development of more effectiveCommunity-wide anti-inflation measures; and consideration of pro-posals for prices under the Common Agricultural Policy in 1973-74.More generally, Community institutions would be pressing ahead withthe programme of work which had been prescribed by the summit meeting in the previous autumn. It was important that our ownconsideration of this programme should proceed sufficiently rapidlyto enable us to respond to the Commission^ proposals and to influence its thinking. Progress was generally satisfactory; but there seemed to be a need to give greater priority to energy policy and to social and employment policy.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Chan-cellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
northern ireland previous reference:CM (72) 58thConclusions,Minute 1SECRET6. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said that thesituation in the Province had deteriorated in the last week as a resultof a series of acts of indiscriminate terrorism which had demon-demonstrated beyond doubt that Protestant elements were now resorting to organised armed violence. He had decided that, despite consid-erable opposition from Protestant sympathisers, he must be seen tobe dealing with Protestant trouble-makers no less firmly than withthe Irish Republican Army. Of the six men seized during the recentincidents two had been made the subject of Internment Orders.The extreme wing of the Protestant movement had reacted by callinga token strike in power stations. Some workers in other sectors had come out in sympathy; and there had consequently been fairly gen-eral disruption. The strike had coincided with the funerals of someCatholics; and in the disorder which had inevitably resultedProtestant gunmen had fired on troops and police. The security forces had acquitted themselves well in these difficulties; and 67people had been arrested.Although the Protestant leadership purported to regret these developments and to be anxious to bring the situation under controlonce more, a critical period now lay ahead; and, if we were to compel the extremists to draw back, it was essential that we should be seen to be dealing with the Protestant elements with complete impartiality.In the interests of limiting violence it would also be desirable to take powers to revoke firearm licences and to require conditions for theirissue. At present there was no need for additional troops to be sentto the Province; but the situation would be kept under close review.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that,although the situation in Northern Ireland had again become tense,the Government must press on with their proposals for constitutional reform. If military reinforcements became necessary, they shouldbe sent on a sufficient scale to control any upsurge of violence.Although we did not seek a confrontation with the Protestants, wemust be prepared to meet one and to demonstrate our determination to sustain law and order.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Defaults onthe housing finance ActsPreviousReference:CM (72) 58thConclusions,Minute 9SECRET7. The Secretary of State for Scotland informed the Cabinetthat opposition to the Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland)Act 1972 was declining; and only six authorities were now in defaultunder the Act. Five of these were likely to capitulate without much further delay. But Clydebank remained obdurate and had failed tocomply not only with the terms of the default Order which had beenmade early in January but also with an interim Order for specific per-formance made by the Court of Session at the end of the month. It
had therefore been necessary to bring this position to the attention ofthe Court; and a substantive hearing of the case would probably takeplace in mid-February. The procedure which had been adopted was calculated to reduce to the minimum the risk that fines or terms of imprisonment might be imposed on individual members of theauthority. But the decision on this point was at the discretion ofthe Court, whose judgment could not be foreseen; and, since it wasvery desirable that the authority should not be allowed to achieve apublic status of martyrdom, it might become necessary for him totake over their housing functions by Order under the Housing(Scotland) Act 1966. The effect of such an Order would be broadlycomparable with that of appointing Housing Commissioners in wales.IndustrialAffairsIndustrialAction in the gas IndustryPreviousReference:CM (73) 4thConclusions,Minute 4Strike ofBritish RoadServicesDriversCONFIDENTIAL8. The Minister of State, Department of Employment, saidthat the General and Municipal Workers&apos; Union had given seven days&apos; notice of their intention to take industrial action in support ofthe gas manual workers&apos; pay claim. Industrial action would begin on 14 February and would comprise either selective strike action oran overtime ban or withdrawal of co-operation or some combination of these measures. The decision about the nature and the extent ofthe action to be taken had been left to individual branches, subject tothe approval of a sub-committee of the union&apos;s Executive, whichwould be concerned only to ensure that safety and health were notendangered. On this basis it was difficult to estimate the severityor the extent of the impact on gas supplies. The forms of industrial action to be adopted, however, gave considerable scope for militantelements to cause disruption.The Minister of State, Department of Employment, said thata dispute involving nearly 1,000 British Road Services (be) driversin the Midlands, now in its second week, had caused serious difficulties for British Leyland, who had had to lay off 16,000workers, with a loss of production of over 10,000 vehicles. When a claim by the Regional Commercial Secretary of the Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union for an extra  2-50 a week for all driversholding heavy goods vehicle licences had been rejected, the drivershad handed in their licences and had claimed, falsely, that they were no longer permitted to drive. be were now being pressed to make some offer of payment equivalent to  2 - 50 a week before the driverswould agree to return to work; but they had so far refused to do so.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Minister of State,Department of Employment.Cabinet Office,8 February, 1973.
