INDUSTRIALAFFAIRSC ounte r -InflationPolicy-previous reference:CM(73pithConclusions,Minute i^V10 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thatthe attempt by the General Council of the Trades Union Congress(TUC) to persuade the delegates at the Special Congress of tradeunions on the previous day to confine themselves to merelyendorsing the TUC*s proposals for countering inflation had provedabortive.    Instead, the Congress had adopted a compositeresolution, sponsored by the Transport and General Workers1Union and the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, whichhad called upon the General Council to organise and to leadco-ordinated action in support of affiliated unions who were in dispute and required such support and to invite affiliated unions tojoin in a day of national protest and stoppage against the wagecontrol policy and increases in food prices.    The terms of theresolution left each union free to decide what action, if any, itshould take;  and the proposed one-day stoppage of work, whichwas to be organised as quickly as possible, was less important initself than the fact that the TUC leadership had been publiclycompelled to bow to pressure from the militant elements in theunions, which would now be strengthened in their resolve to provokethe maximum disruption within industry.    The outcome might beto intensify industrial action in, for example, the gas industry andthe National Health Service (NHS) and perhaps to lead to national strike action.    It would become correspondingly important to makea renewed effort to convince public opinion that the Government were adopting the only possibl3 policy to combat inflation.    Continuedempnasis should be placed upon the improvement in the position of low-paid workers which would result from the adoption of the paypolicy.In discussion it was suggested that some of the trade union leaderswho had been involved in planning the tactics adopted by the TUCGeneral Council for the Special Congress considered that the call for a one-day stoppage would suffice to relieve the pressure on individual unions to take more militant action and, even if fully supported, would therefore be less damaging to the economy in thelong run.    This might prove to be a not wholly incorrect estimate.The GasIndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 12thConclusions,Minute 4wTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that industrial action in the gas industry was being intensified;  and theunion leaders were progressively losing control over the militants,while remaining unable themselves to foresee any means ofextricating their members from the present deadlock.    The unions had called for a meeting of the National Joint Negotiating Council(NJNC) for the gas industry to be held on the following day, at whichthey were expected to press the British Gas Corporation (BGC) toagree that their pay claim should be referred to arbitration.    Itwould be difficult to reject this proposal, since the relevant
agreement enabled either side in the industry to proposearbitration.    Nevertheless, there was obviously a risk thatarbitration awards during Stage 2 of the pay policy would be liableto create expectations about wage increases once Stage 2 wasended, which might prejudice the policy for Stage 3.    The BGCwould probably agree to a reference to arbitration on condition that the unions first agreed to order a return to work and thatthere should be a reference to the relevant provisions of the pay code in the terms of reference for the arbitration panel.    Theunions, however, were unlikely to accept these stipulations.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY saidthat, in discussion that morning, Mr Basnett, *he General Secretaryof the General and Municipal Workers&apos; Union,had agreed toconsider whether an undertaking from the BGC that there wouldbe no redundancy among gas workers before the Stage 3 policy was introduced - an undertaking which could now be given becauseof the backlog of work created by the industrial action - would assist him in securing a return to normal working.    But he hadbeen unable to hold out much hope that this proposal would in facthave any significant influence on his members.    The unionsattached more importance to the fact that there was now scope inthe industry for increases in pay as a result of restructuringschemes and other improvements in productivity which, under the pay Code for Stage 2, would have to count against the pay limit.The inability to introduce such improvements was causingfrustration on both sides of the industry.    He had made it clear toMr Basnett, however, that there was no possibility of any increaseoutside the pay limit during Stage 2.    He had also warnedMr Basnett that the Government considered that the situation asregards safety in the gas industry was now approaching the point where the use of Emergency Powers would need to be considered.There was a difference of opinion between the unions and theBGC about the degree of danger involved in appealing to usersvoluntarily to turn off gas supplies, as had been done in theWest Midlands, as distinct from a total cutting-off of supplies bythe BGC in particular areas.    The unions had volunteered toco-operate in cutting off supplies; but the BGC had refused this offer because of the dislocation which it would cause and the lengthof time involved in subsequent re-connection,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that on 2 March the BGC had asked the Government to take Emergency Powers.    The CivilContingencies Unit had kept this request under review and, taking account of the fact that a meeting of the Executive Committees ofthe gas unions was due to take place that afternoon and that therewas to be a meeting of the NJNC on the following day, had concluded that, since the BGC had been able to continue operating at a safe
level without such powers, the time for their introduction was notyet opportune.    The Unit had therefore recommended that, whilethe weather remained mild and the Chairman of the BGC remainedwilling not to give publicity to his request for Emergency Powers,action to proclaim a State of Emergency should not be taken.In discussion it was suggested that care should be taken not to makethe terms of reference for arbitration in the gas industry toorestrictive, since at a later stage it would be necessary to find some basis on which there might be a resumption of work.    On theother hand it was essential that no indication should be given to theunions that there was any possibility of a pay offer during Stage 2which exceeded the pay limit.    Moreover, while it might bedifficult to refuse to allow the unions and the BGC to arrange for arbitration, careful consideration should be given both to the termsof reference for the panel and to any negotiations aboutrestructuring or productivity, since these would provide the unionswith an opportunity to create an expectation of pay increases duringStage 3 which would be above the general limit for wage increasesduring that stage.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF)had now decided to call a further one-day national strike on8 March and to ban all Sunday working with effect from 11 March,The Chairman of the British Railways Board (BRB) was meetingASLEF representatives that day in an attempt to persuade them tojoin with the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) and the TransportSalaried Staffs Association (TSSA) in discussion of the railwaymen!annual pay claim.    ASLEF, however, were insisting upon further discussions of the restructuring of drivers1 pay before participating in joint discussions with the BRB and the other unions on the annualpay claim, whereas the NUR were insisting that the BRB should not hold any further restructuring discussions with ASLEF in advanceof the annual negotiations.    If the discussions with ASLEF ended in deadlock, the BRB intended to adopt a more severe attitudetowards drivers who worked to rule.    This might intensifyindustrial action, possibly to the extent of provoking a continuingnational strike by ASLEF drivers.In discussion it was questioned whether the BRB would be wise to run die risk of precipitating action by ASLEF members which could bring the railways to a halt.    On the other hand ASLEF would receive no support from the NUR or TSSA for strike action;  anda firm stand by the BRB provided the best prospect of persuading the ASLEF members, who would be given advance warning of the3
likelihood of disciplinary action, to call off their industrial action,,Indeed, the General Secretaries of not only the NUR and TSSA butalso ASLEF now believed that an early settlement of the present dispute should be possible,National Health THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that,Service while it was true that the initial extent of the militancy amongstAncillary the NHS ancillary workers at local level had made it difficult for workers the union leaders to fulfil their assurances that essential services at hospitals would be maintained, only about 2 per cent of the totalPrevious number of beds available in the hospitals in mojt regions had soReference: far had to be taken out of use.    The position in hospital laundriesCM(73) 12th was generally difficult but tolerable.    The form, extent and timingConclusions, of industrial action varied from place to place j  and there had been minute 4 some reports of difficulties arising from picketing.    He proposedto discuss with the Secretary of State for Employment whether thetime was yet opportune to appeal to the leaders of the four unions concerned to call off the strike.In discussion it was suggested that public support for the NHSancillary workers was tending to increase, on che grounds thatthey were low-paid.    In these circumstances it would be desirableto publicise the fact that they would be entitled to receive theirStage 2 pay increase with effect from the following week, if agreement could be reached on the distribution of the total amount involved.    If it were true that pickets were preventing food from being delivered to some hospitals, publicity should also be givento this fact, particularly since such action was in any case illegal.The WaterIndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 11thConclusion s.Minute 1THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe manual workers of five undertakings in the water industry had decided to take unofficial strike action on 9 March,    This shouldnot cause any serious problems as regards the supply of water inthese areas.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the situation in the gas industry did not yet makeit necessary or desirable to recommend the proclamation of a Stateof Emergency.    The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry andthe Secretary of State for Employment should consider further what
advice should be given to the BGC against the possibility that the gas unions might seek arbitration on their pay claim;   and theyshould also consider whether there were any means, within theterms of the pay policy, whereby the union leaders might be assisted in seeking to persuade their members to end the present industrial action.    The Secretary of State for Social services should consider with the Secretary of State for Employment the timing of any approach to the unions representing the NHS ancillary workers about the possibility of ending the industrial action in the hospitals.    It would also be desirable that publicity should be givento the pay increases to which the ancillary workers would beentitled during the following week.    The Home Secretary and theLord President should consider whether the Chairman of the british broadcasting Corporation should be invited to correct theCorporation^ tendency to dramatise the impact of industrial actionin such a way as to arouse public concern to an unjustifiable extent.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Secretary of State foi- Tradeand Industry and the Secretary of State for employment to consider further the Government1 attitude to arbitration on the gas workers&apos; payclaim, together with possible means of bringing the dispute to an end, as indicated in the prime minister s summing up.3.        Invited the Secretary of State for social services and the Secretary of State for employment to consider the timing of an approach to the unions representing the national health Service ancillary workers, together withpublicity for the pay increase to which theywould soon be entitled, in accordance with thePrime Ministers summing up,4.        Invited the Home Secretary and theLord President of the Council to consider thedesirability of an approach to the Chairman ofthe British Broadcasting Corporation, asindicated in the Prime Ministers summing up.
TENANCIES of high RATEABLEVALUEDWELLINGSPreviousReference:CM(73) 11thConclusions,Minute 22. The Cabinet resumed their discussion about tenanciesof high rateable value dwellings. They had before them amemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Environment(CP(73) 28).THE MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND CONSTRUCTION said   that,on the basis of an assurance given during the recent debate thatthe Government were themselves considering the position of the tenants of unfurnished accommodation and would be prepared toput down amendments to the Counter-Inflation Bill in theHouse of Lords in order to give effect to whatever remedial action might be found appropriate, Mr Tugendhat^ MP had withdrawn his own amendment seeking to raise the rateable value (RV) limit below which unfurnished tenancies were subjectto the fair rent principle.    There now seemed to be fourpossible courses of action.   First, measures might be found forhelping the tenants of expensive unfurnished accommodation with-out giving them security of tenure and rent control.   But these measures would not fully meet the needs of the situation andwould certainly not be regarded as adequate by the LondonMembers of Parliament who were particularly concerned about this issue.    Second, the RV limits could be raised above theirpresent figures of  400 in London and  200 elsewhere.    Thiswould be a relatively simple action and would meet the wishes of the London Members.    The Government might be accused of inequity, however, if they did not at the same time affordincreased protection to the tenants of furnished accommodation.Third, a new system of control based on indices might be devised.    This would be presentationally satisfactory in the context of counter-inflationary policies; but it would involve considerable practical difficulties and would be liable to expose the general principle of fair rents to attack.    Fourth, the bill might be amended in such a way as to provide protection for the tenants of furnished accommodation also.    This should absolvethe Government from any charge of inequity, but at the cost of a major change of policy, the duration of which could not in practice be linked to the duration of Part II of the Counter-Inflation Bill.Moreover, it would he likely seriously to prejudice the alreadyinadequate supply of furnished accommodation;  and it wouldinvolve complex legislative provisions, which might well proveless than fully effective.    In these circumstances the second course - an increase in the RV limits in relation to unfurnishedtenancies - seemed least open to objection.    If so, the newlimits should be  600 in London and  400 elsewhere, thusprotecting some 80 per cent of unregulated tenancies andconcentrating assistance where it was most needed.    Despite therecommendation in CP(73) 28 that this arrangement should apply only for the duration of Part II of the Counter-Inflation Bill, itwould be preferable that it should be made permanent, since, if it
were only temporary, the Bill would have to include transitional provisions dealing with the situation which would arise whenPart II expired and serious practical problems would arise fortenants if Part II were suspended before the end of the threeyear period at present envisaged.    The Bill should not be amended in order to provide rent control or security of tenurefor the tenants of furnished accommodation; but the Secretary ofState for the Environment proposed to consider what other steps might be taken in order to improve conditions in the worst areasof housing stress.The Cabinet -Approved the proposals in CP(73) 28 on the basis that the relevant amendments to the Counter-Inflation Bill should be so framed as to be effectivepermanently and not merely for the duration ofPart II of the Bill.Cabinet Office6 March 19737
