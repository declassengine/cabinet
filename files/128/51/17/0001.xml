parliamentary affairs. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.National HealthServiceReorganisation Bill:previous reference:CM(?3) feeConclusions,Minute 3Two days had been set aside for the Second Reading debate on the National Health Service Reorganisation Bill, thesecond day being devoted to its Welsh aspects.    Under an informal arrangement which had been made with theOpposition, the Report Stage and Third Reading would becompleted rapidly, in order to allow all stages in the Houseof Commons to be completed before the Whitsun Recess.EuropeanC ommunitie s:ParliamentaryScrutiny of DraftInstruments.previous reference:CM(73) 9thConclusions,Minute 1The Cabinet were informed that there was considerable pressure for a monthly statement to be made in the Houseof Commons indicating the business likely to be considered at Ministerial level within the European Economic Community(e.c.) during the succeeding month.    If such an arrangementwere not accepted, there might be difficulty in resistingpressure for a statement to be made after each of theseMinisterial meetings;  and this would be a less acceptablealternative.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion,said that a very considerable amount of business wastransacted by Ministers within the e.c. but that it wasrarely possible to forecast which items would be dealt withduring any given month.   A monthly statement in advance would thus open a wide field of subject matter to potentialParliamentary scrutiny but would place the Government in a difficult position because they would be unable to give sub-substantive answers on matters about which Ministerial decisions had not yet been taken.    A final decision on the procedure to be recommended to the House of Commons should therefore be deferred until further consideration had beengiven to the respective merits and demerits of the course proposed and of other possible courses.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
2.      Invited the Lord President of the Council,in consultation with the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, to consider further whatprocedure should be recommended to the House ofCommons as regards Parliamentary considerationof Ministerial business in the European economic community; and to report their conclusions to thePrime Minister.Wages paid by The Cabinet were informed that there was likely to be british Firms in pressure for a Parliamentary debate on the recent PressSouth Africa reports suggesting that unduly low wages were in some casesbeing paid to African employees of the South Africansubsidiaries or branches of British-owned firms.    TheDepartment of Trade and Industry had issued some factualmaterial about wage payments and related matters for the guidance of British firms operating in foreign countries;and the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry, should consider how it might be put to the bestpresentational use.Economic Affairs:Counter-InflationaryPoliciesPreviousReference:CM(73) 7thConclusions,Minute 1The Cabinet were reminded of the importance of maintaining the Governments efforts to secure the most effectivepresentation of their counter-inflationary policies.    It was particularly desirable that public opinion should be givenclear factual information about the disputes on the railwaysand in the Civil Service in such a way as to establish the relevant facts without seeking to apportion blame or to attack the trade unions concerned but expressing the Governmentssympathy with the public as regards the severe inconveniencewhich they were suffering as a result of industrial action.2
2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH secretary said that some harassment of our trawlers off Icelandcontinued;  and 4 warps had been cut on the previous day.There were some indications, however, that the PrimeMinister of Iceland, Mr. Johannes son, now wished to renew negotiations with us.    Subject to more detailed consideration of a possible basis for agreement, it might be wise to respond to an initiative of this kind; and, in themeantime, the introduction of reconnaissance flights byNimrod aircraft to identify the Icelandic gunboats should be delayed.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD,said that some of our trawlers had been fishing, in defiance of instructions, in areas outside those in which we could hope to provide some protection.    They were beingreminded of their obligations in this respect.    discussions would be held very shortly with the industry in an attemptto ascertain their probable reaction to negotiations based onsuch intimations as we had received from the IcelandicPrime Minister.    It would not be easy to secure their consent to the kind of concessions which we might be obligedto make in order to obtain an agreement.    Despite warpcutting the level of their catch had been high;  and they were likely to be very reluctant to accept an agreement which contained both a provision for catch limitation and a restriction on the size of boats permitted to fish.THE PRIME MINISTER, slimming up a brief discuss-on, saidthat, while it would clearly be desirable to reach an agreementwith the Icelandic authorities if acceptable terms could beobtained, we must take into account both the reaction of theindustry and the fact that, if we accepted a substantial reduction in the catch, this would be reflected in the Cost ofLiving Index at an inopportune moment in the development ofthe Governmenfs counter-inflationary policies.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.OVERSEA AFFAIRSIcelandPreviousReference:CM(72) 54thConclusions,Minute 2
Kenya THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Kenyan Minister of Finance, Mr Kibaki, and Minister forForeign Affairs, Dr. Mungai, had visited London between  and 9 March.M In general, the discussions had been satisfactory;but it was regrettable that, although he had made it clear to themthat we could not agree to an increase in the immigration quota for Asian United Kingdom Passport Holders from Kenya, theyhad given the impression, on their return to Nairobi, that thismatter was under negotiation.    It would be necessary to remindPresident Kenyatta of his firm undertaking to the Secretary ofState for Defence that pressure would not be put upon us toincrease the quota.The Cabinet -2.      Took note of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.4
EUROPEAN 3. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERCOMMUNITY informed the Cabinet that he had visited Copenhagen onAFFAIRS 12/13 March as the first of a series of visits to capitals ofthe member States of the European Economic Community(e.c.).    His discussions there had been constructive;  and, sinceDenmark was due to assume the Presidency of the Council ofMinisters on 1 July, it was helpful that the Danish Ministerfor Foreign Economic Affairs (Mr Norgaard) shared some ofour reservations about the procedural methods of the Council.Mr Norgaard had expressed an interest in paying a return visit to the United Kingdom before July; and this would be valuableif it could be arranged.    The comments made to him inCopenhagen showed, however, that the Danish Government didnot fully appreciate the United Kingdom&apos;s desire to find a&quot;Community solution&quot; to the recent monetary difficulties.    Hehad attempted to correct this misunderstanding.The Chancellor of the. Duchy of Lancaster said that he had addressed the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 14 Marchand had been impressed by the standing and positive approach of the United Kingdom Delegation.    He doubted, however,whether this could be sustained in view of the very limitedimpact of the Parliament on Community decisions.    It would       ;be necessary to consider, at the appropriate point, how the parliament might be more closely involved in Communitybusiness.    A meeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture)of the e.c. had been called at short notice for 12 March as aresult of the intransigence of the French Government about thearrangements for phasing out United Kingdom agriculturalguarantees.    The meeting had ended satisfactorily from our point of view.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement bythe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.5
9INDUSTRIALAFFAIRSBritish RailwaysBoardPreviousReference:CM(73) 15thConclusions,Minute 64. THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES saidthat inter-city passenger train services were now operatingalmost normally and that there were only local difficulties as regards the movement of freight by rail.    The problemscaused by the continued unofficial action of drivers who were members of the Associated Society of Locomotive engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) in refusing to co-operate with manage-ment were largely confined to London commuter services onthe Southern and Eastern regions.    Because of the continueddisruption of these services the British Railways Board (BRB)had now come to the conclusion that they could no longer afford to adopt a lenient attitude towards the drivers concerned; andthey had therefore ceased to pay the guaranteed mileage bonusto drivers who refused to obey reasonable instructions.    they also proposed to inform the unions that day that, with effect from the following Monday, ASLEF drivers who refused toobey reasonable instructions would, at the discretion of seniormanagement, be sent home without pay.    The Board envisaged that in these circumstances it might then become necessary,with effect from Monday 26 March, to lay off without pay allrailwaymen, regardless of their union, for whom there was thenno v/ork available.    The Board were very conscious of the risk that an escalation of industrial action would result and thatthere was also a. risk that other unions would adopt a moresympathetic attitude towards ASLEF than was at present the case.They considered, however, that they had no other option in thepresent circumstances if discipline was not to be eroded and services brought to a standstill by the refusal of drivers, on thebasis of frivolous complaints, to operate tsalns.The GasIndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 15thConclusions,Minute 6THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY said that the unions representingthe gas manual workers had now sent out ballot forms seeking the views of their members on the revised pay offer made bythe British Gas Corporation (BGC).    The result of the ballotwas expected to be available on 23 March; and the BGC nowbelieved that there were some grounds for optimism that theoffer would prove acceptable.    The gas supply had now been restored to the 50, 000 domestic consumers in the West Midlandswho had been without gas for about 10 days; and it was hopedthat there would be no need for a further cutting off of supplies to domestic consumers.
NationalHealthServiceAncillary-WorkersPreviousReference:CM(73) 15thConclusions,Minute 6THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thatthe industrial action by National Health Service (NHS)ancillary workers continued to place the Service under e severe strain.    But it was still proving possible to maintain restrictedworking; and all essential facilities were being operated.    Hehad invited the unions concerned to meet him again; and he hoped that they would accept a slightly improved pay offer, withinthe terms of the Pay Code.Civil ServiceTfeioHS-previous reference:CM(73) 15thConclusions,Minute 6THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that some members of the civil and Public Services Association (CPSA) were now on strike atoffices of the Board of Customs and Excise, the Departmentof the Environment, the Department of National Savings and elsewhere.    It was not clear how long this industrial action would last.The CoalIndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 15thConclusions,Minute 6THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY said that on the previous day hehad discussed with the Chairman of the National Coal Board(NCB) and the President of the National Union of Mine workers(NUM) whether there was any basis on which the latter mightbe able to persuade the NUM Executive, which was due to meeton the following day, to recommend the NCB&apos;s pay offer to theminers.    The union was seeking either the concession of an extra week*s holiday with immediate effect or an assurance thatthis would be granted diaring^ the aesrt year, or at; least whencircumstances permitted.   He had made it clear that any assurance given at the present time would be a breach of the pay Code.    Any indication that the possibility of granting theminers an extra week*s holiday might be contemplated at some stage in the future would be interpreted by the NUM as a promise.This could be embarrassing at a later stage; would be liable toreduce the prospect of settlements in other current pay negotiations, such as those concerning the gas workers and the engineers in the electricity supply industry; and would constitute an invitation to other unions to seek binding assurances about future improvements in pay and conditions.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theTrades Union Congress (TUC) had not yet decided the tactics for,OS tSie timing of, the day of national protest and stoppageagainst statutory wage controls and increasing food prices, uponwhich the Special Congress had resolved.    It seemed likely thatthe stoppage would take place early in April and that workers inthe engineering, docks, road and rail transport, pujatiag &amp;r.dbuilding industries would participate.    There seemed, however,to be no general enthusiasm for the stoppage; and some unions,including the Electrical, Electronic and TelecommunicationsUnion, would not take part.In discussion the following main points were made -a. It was questionable whether the BRB had adopted the correct tactics in taking disciplinary action againstindividual drivers.    Since ASLEF was seeking to breachindustrial agreements in the railways industry, it mighthave been preferable to seek to bring the pressure to bearon ASLEF itself, for example by refusing to collect unionsubscriptions on its behalf or by suspending the operationof the guaranteed working week.    On the other hand a suspension of the collection of union subscriptions would present the BRB with serious technical difficulties andwould make little financial impact on ASLEF.    It would actmerely as an irritant;  and it might also make other unions,including the National Union of Railwaymen, moresympathetic towards ASLEF.    The BRB had already saidthat they would be opposed to this course.    The third stage of their plan, however, i. e. the laying off withoutpay of all railwaymen for whom there was no work, didinvolve the suspension of the guaranteed working week.b. The public were confused about the causes of the railwaymen,s dispute.    It was desirable to explain thedifference between the current annual railway pay negotiations and the attempt by ASLEF to improve thestatus of its drivers at the expense of the other railway unions.    The significance of the action which the BRBwere taking such as ceasing to pay the guaranteed mileagebonus, should also be explained.    It was for consideration whether the Chairman of the BRB should be persuaded tomake a public statement about these matters.TUC One-dayStoppagePreviousReference:CM(73) 14thConclusions,Minute 1
c. It was not without significance that the EconomicCommittee of the TUC had failed to respond tci ihe pleaby the National Union of Public Employees for TUCsupport for the industrial action by the NHS ancillary workers, which had been remitted to the Finance andGeneral Purposes Committee of the TUC for consideration.d. Any genuine opportunity of finding some basisupon which the Executive of the NUM could recommendacceptance of the NCB!s pay offer to its members shouldnot be missed.    If it were possible to give some assurance about an improvement in holidays in the future without inany way breaching the Pay Code, it might be desirable todo so.    On the other hand the NUM had been offeredconso.U.da.tion of the five rest days granted in theWilberforce settlement into a third week&apos;s holiday, whichwould be permitted by the Pay Code and would enableminers to take 3 consecutive weeks&apos; holiday.    But theyhad not appeared interested in this proposal.    In any event, any concession as regards holidays would be most unlikely to have any significant effect upon the attitude of either the NUM Executive or the miners generally to theNCB&apos;s pay offer.    Nevertheless, it would be important to make clear publicly that the miners had been offered the opportunity of 3 consecutive weeks1 holiday.THE PRIMF MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theSecretary of State for the Environment should consider whether itwould be preferable for a Minister or the Chairman of theBRB to appear on television in order to clarify the issues in therailways dispute and to counter the ASLEF claim that no one would consider the genuine grievances of its members.    The Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry and the Secretary of State for employment should consider further whether it would be possible,within the terms of the Pay Code, to devise any formula inrelation to the eventual possibility of granting additional leave to the mineworkers which would be likely to assist in persuading the NUM to accept a pay offer which in total remained within the pay limit and would not endanger the effectiveness of theapplication of the Governments pay policy in other cases.Publicity should be given to the fact that the miners now had theopportunity to take 3 consecutive weeks&apos; leave.The Cabinet -/&apos;1.

BUILDINGS OCIETIESInterestcharge onMortgagesPreviousReference:CM(73) 15thConclusions,Minute 26. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of theproposed increase in the rate of interest charged on mortgagesby tiie Building Societies.    They had before them a memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Home Department (CP(73) 32).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat, together with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and theMinister for Housing and Construction, he had recently metrepresentatives of the Building Societies.    They had explainedthat they were not only failing to attract a sufficient volume ofnew deposits but were also losing existing deposits at analarming rate.   This trend had appeared at least 2 months before the Budget statement.    It was clear that, unlessassistance was forthcoming from the Government, the Societieshad no choice but to increase the rate of interest charged toborrowers.    A rate of 9&quot;lper cent seemed inescapable in theimmediate future;  and a further increase to 10 per cent mightwell become necessary later.    The only possible way toprevent these increases would be for the Government to offer the Building Societies a loan, or to give them a guarantee,which would enable them to reduce their minimum permissibleliquidity.    There were undoubtedly very strong economicobjections to both these courses, as indicated in CP(73) 32.On the other hand an increase of 1 per cent in the rate ofinterest charged on mortgages would be damaging to theGovernments counter-inflationary policies and would be likelyto have serious effects on the housing programme, where theGovernment were already open to criticism.    If for economic reasons no help could be offered to the Building Societies in the&apos;short run, it might at least be possible to secure some temporarydeferment of the proposed increase in the rate of interest and   $thus to allow time for the consideration of a possible long-term;scheme for the stabilisation of mortgage finance which wouldnot require financial support from the Government.Presentationally, this course would seem preferable to animmediate increase in interest rates unaccompanied by any indication of concern on the part of the Government.In discussion it was argued that the immediate situation could b*emet only by the provision of an Exchequer loan or guarantee.Both were highly undesirable on economic grounds.    The first :would add directly to the Governmenfs already high borrowing &apos;requirement;  and the second, whether or not the guaranteewas taken up, would in effect add to the public sector borrowing requirement, because the Societies in reducing their liquiditywould be realising a substantial volume of public debt.    these courses would therefore be feasible only if they were accompanied either by a tighter money policy for the rest of the
economy or by higher rates of taxation or by counter -balancing reductions in other areas of public expenditure.    an approach to the banks to provide the Building Societies withthe initial finance for a stabilisation fund would be likely to beopen to precisely similar objections.     It might be suggestedthat additional fiscal concessions should be offered to theBuilding Societies.    But owner-occupiers buying their houses by means of mortgages were already very favourably treated;and to single them out for further concessions would expose the Government to criticism from other sections of thecommunity.    On the other hand it was argued that for political and social reasons alike there was a ^easy,&apos;strongjeaaefor intervention and that the consequences which would follow from an increase in interest rates to 9j per cent, and laterperhaps to 10 per cent, could clearly be very serious.    Anincrease to 9^ per cent would mean that the net cost ofmortgage payments would increase by about 7 per cent, andthis at a time when incomes were subject to strict restraint.Many people would become unable to afford mortgages;  andas a result the number of houses built would probably bereduced by about 30, 000 to 40, 000 a year.    Whatever action might subsequently be taken, it would be a considerable time before confidence could be restored and the housing programmebe re-established at an adequate level.    The GovernmentsLousing record was already regarded as unsatisfactory by manyof their supporters; and a situation in which the rate of interest-on mortgages reached its highest known level at the same time a.0 the numbesr of houses beiag built declined mb^onti&amp;lly below a level which itself was already inadequate would scarcely betolerable.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that strenuous efforts must be made to seekmeans of avoiding the serious consequences of an increase to9j per cent in the rate of interest charged on mortgages whichwas unaccompanied by any corrective action by the Government.There were weighty objections, however, to increasing eitherpublic expenditure or the Governments borrowing requirement.There might prove co be a case for an adjustment of existing programmes in order to give greater priority to housing.    this possibility might have to be considered in the light of theconclusions reached by the group of Ministers who were currently examining the question of land and house prices(. but phort term action was not practicable.    Forthe immediate future the aim should be to persuade the building societies, in the interests of the Governments counter-inflationary policies, to defer at least for a few weeks any increase in the rate of interest charged to borrowers.    If they
could not defer an increase in the rate of interest paid todepositors, they might be able to meet the position for themoment by a decrease in liquidity.    The time thus gainedshould be used for an urgent examination of the measureswhich could be taken to restrain excessive increases in therate of interest on mortgages and to reduce fluctuations inthe availability of mortgage finance, including the possibilityof a long-term stabilisation scheme which would involve little,or nO, financial participation by the Government.    But noadvance commitment should be given to the Societies in thisrespect.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Secretary of State for the environment, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer -&amp; .:tao Hold immediate discussions withthe representatives of the Building Societieson the lines indicated in the Prime Minister*summing up;b.    in the light of those discussions, to submit proposals to the Cabinet on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.BSA AND THE ,7. THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said thatMOTOR CYCLE the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy, at theirINDUSTRY meeting on the previous day had been unable to reach an agreed conclusion about a proposal by the Minister for industrial Development to provide support under Section 8 ofthe Industry Act, 1972, for a merger of the motor cycleinterests of the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) andNorton Villiers.    Meanwhile, rumours that BSA were in difficulties had developed;  the share price had fallen sharply;and dealings had been suspended.    In view both of the urgentnaed to reach a decision and the important principle at issue as regards the use of the Industry Act, it had become necessaryto refer the matter to the Cabinet.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRYsaid that BSA had experienced financial difficulties for sometime;  and discussions between the company and his department had been proceeding for several months.    But inthe past few weeks the company1 s financial position had deteriorated sharply, particularly as a result of the devaluation of the United States dollar.    Their main creditor,Barclays Bank Limited, were not prepared to maintainsupport for them in their present form; and the company, whoaccounted for three-quarters of the British motor cycleindustry and attracted export earnings of about  20 million ayear, were now threatened with being forced into receivership.Although the management had been strengthened in the past two years and had made strenuous efforts to improve thecompany&apos;s position. Government support could not be justifiedin terms of rescuing them.    But Norton Villiers, under theirparent company Manganese Bronze, were prepared to mergewith the motor cycle activities of BSA in order to form a new company.    Their management, under the leadership ofMr Denis Poore, had succeeded in two years in converting a loss of  1 million into a profit of  0. 14 million; and they believed that they could bring the combined company into profiton current trading (but before charging rationalisation andotner special costs) in 1973-74.    The Industrial DevelopmentAdvisory Board had recommended that Government supportnot exceeding  5 million in the form of a shareholding shouldbe offered to facilitate the merger.    Moreover, there were clearly strong a priori arguments for backing the commercial judgment of a s\iccessful entrepreneur who was prepared to commit the assets of his company, in which his whole personalfortune was involved, to an enterprise which would significantlyenlarge exports in an expanding market.    In similar circumstances our major competitors would not hesitate toprovide comparable support for their own industries.In discussion it was suggested that the critical question wasprofitability rather than export earnings.    A competentmanagement had been trying to put BSA&apos;s affairs on a soundfooting for the last two or three years.    But losses stillcontinued;  and there could be no confidence - as the attitudeof the banks and other potential sources of private capitaldemonstrated - that the merged company would show a profit.The national economy might be better served by releasing toother industries the resources now employed by BSA in an area of the West Midlands where engineering skills were in short supply.    Moreover, opinion among the governments supporters might be hostile to this use of the powers underSection 8 of the Industry Act;   and, although the concealedsubsidy implicit in the proposal might not be an issue of greatmoment among our partners in the European Economic
Community, it would be assessed in the context of othermatters where we might at present appear to be actingagainst the spirit of the Community and might provokodisproportionate criticism on that account.On the other hand the unwillingness of banking circles tosupport Norton Villiers was more symptomatic of thecaution with which they tended to approach any enterprisewithout a proven record of success than of unsoundness inthe project itself.    The Government had taken powers inthe Industry Act to provide support of this kind; and theyshould not lightly disregard the considered advice of theBoard whom they had appointed to judge applications.    Thebalance of trade might remain in deficit for some time;  andthere were therefore strong arguments for not letting slip ac?ear opportunity, for a relatively modest premium, toimprove our export potential.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, saidthat, in view particularly of the implications for exports the Cabinet agreed, on balance, to the Secretary of State&apos;proposal.    But in presenting the Governments decision,care should be taken to show that their support was directed to furthering the progress of Norton Villiers, and not torescuing BSA from difficulties of their own making.The Cabinet -1.      Agreed that Government support underSection 8 of the Industry Act, 1972, amountingto about  4,75 million should be offered to anew motor cycle company to be formed fromBirmingham Sm&amp;JA Arms and Manganese Bronze.2.      Invited the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry, in making public the terms ofthis offer, to be guided by the views expressedby the Prime Minister in his summing up ofthe discussion.Cabinet Office15 March 1973

Although we could not go as far as the Governmentof the Republic might wish in respect of the last of these points,the draft White Paper went a long way towards meeting mostof Mr. Cosgravefs other anxieties. For the rest the ministers directly concerned, after a careful scrutiny of the draft, hadidentified a number of points on which some modification orclarification of the text was desirable.    They had also formed the view that, while the draft contained a comprehensive andpersuasive analysis of the Governments proposals, its presentation would be more forefcful if its concluding sectionsummarised their main features and indicated both their inter-relationship and their cumulative effect. The Secretary of state had accordingly prepared a new Part 6, entitled &quot;Summaryand Conclusion&quot;.
discussion the following main points were made:-The Constitutional Status of Northern ireland a..      The White Paper*s reaffirmation (inparagraph 33) that Northern Ireland would notcease to be part of the United Kingdom withoutthe consent of its people should be accompaniedby a statement that there would be no increasein the number of Northern Ireland members inthe Parliament at Westminster.The Assemblyb. While it might be useful to retain a provision(as in paragraph 41) enabling Her Majesty laCouncil to dissolve the Assembly in order topermit new elections within less than the proposednormal term of 5 years, the Assembly might thenappear to have even less independence than localauthorities in Great Britain.    Moreover, while the concept of a dissolution was valid in relation to a sovereign assembly, it was inappropriate to a subordinate body such as the proposed assembly in Northern Ireland.    For these reasons it would be preferable to prescribe a fixed term of 4 years forthe life of the Assembly, with no provision fordissolution.    If it became necessary to dismiss theAssembly, special legislation would have to beintroduced.The Executivec. The final sentence of paragraph 52, whichwould exclude from the Executive representativesof organisations whose objectives were to subvertthe constitution by violent means, might beconstrued as justifying the exclusion of individuals who were unquestionably Republican in sympathybut nevertheless abhorred violence and could makea valuable contribution to an Executive in whichpolitical power was genuinely shared.    Unionistopinion, however, would be unlikely to accept theWhite Paper unless it was clear that individualsdedicated to subversion and violence could not be members of the Executive; and this would be particularly the case if no oath of allegiance was required of members of the Assembly.   In these2
circumstances it might be preferable to adopt amore positive presentation of the issue byindicating that the Executive must be representativeof the great majority of the people of NorthernIreland, who were prepared to adhere to constitutional methods of working; and this general principle might perhaps take the form of a requirement that members of the Executive, likemany office-holders in the rest of the UnitedKingdom, should make an appropriate declarationof their intention faithfully to discharge the dutiesof office.ReBtraltete-,.MffiS3t Devolved Legislative Powersd. The proposal that members of the proposedAssembly should take the same oath as Membersof Parliament at Westminster (paragraph 64) wouldhave great symbolic value for Unionists.    Never the -less, the question of an oath of allegiance had beena major stumbling-block in the negotiationspreceding the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921; and torequire the members of the new Assembly to take anoath might aeter moderate and responsible membersof the minority community, for whom it representedno less a point of principle than for the Unionists,from participating in the Assembly^ work.Notwithstanding the risk of creating an unfortunateprecedent for any local Assemblies which might atsome stage be created in Scotland and Wales, itwould be preferable, on balance, to maintain that anoath of allegiance was inappropriate to a subordinatebody and, accordingly, to dispense with the require-ment for any affirmation of this kind.Appointment of Heads of Departmentse. The final sentence of paragraph 73, dealingwith the salaries of those members of the Assemblywho became Heads of Departments and accordinglyconstituted the Executive, should specify that theGovernment would seek the advice of the bodycharged with the independent review of publicfervice salaries within the United Kingdom as a whole.3
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, saidthat the Secretary of State should now arrange for the textto be finally revised to take account of the points made in discussion and of any further drafting suggestions which ministers might wish to put forward.    For security reasons the precise date of publication should be kept secret; and,meanwhile, precautionary dispositions had been put in hand for the reinforcement of the security forces in the event of widespread disturbances when the White Paper was published.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office16 March 19734
