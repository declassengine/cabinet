Official Secrets. 1. The Prime Minister said that he had been disturbed by recent instances of unauthorised disclosure of official information,including premature publication in the Press of matters still underconsideration by Ministers. An example was the report, published in the Daily Express on 2nd July, of the results of the recent discussions with the South African Minister of Defence. Govern-ment business could not be carried on effectively unless a high standard of discretion was maintained in the handling of confidential information. He asked that Ministers in charge of departments should impress on their junior Ministers and others concerned theneed for care in this respect and, in particular, for discretion in theircontacts with representatives of the Press.House of 2.   The Lord Privy Seal said that his attention had been drawnCommons to a further case in which a Member of the House of Commons mightDisqualification, have become, disqualified by acceptance of an office of profit under(Previous the Crown.   It was thought that. Sir Roland Jennings, M.P., had reference: become disqualified by the fact of his appointment as a public auditorCM. (55) 18th under the Friendly Societies Act.   It would be necessary that this conclusions. case should be referred to a Select Committee, and an Indemnity BillMinute 5.) might be required.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Retirement otVice-AdmiralJ. HughesHallett.(previous reference:C.C(54)61stConclusions.Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (CP. (55) 56) and the Attorney-General (CP. (55) 61)about a claim by Vice-Admiral J. Hughes Hallett, M.P., that heshould receive damages or compensation by reason of the fact thathe had been led to suppose that he would be entitled to retired payat the rate of  1,200 instead of  873 a year.The First Lord of the Admiralty recalled the circumstances ofthis case, as described to the Cabinet on 21st September, 1954, andthe Cabinet&apos;s agreement to defer a decision on it at that time.Subsequently, Admiral Hughes Hallett&apos;s solicitors had informed theAdmiralty of his intention to take legal proceedings for damages if his claim to the higher rate of retired pay could not be met. Thechoices now before the Government were to grant retired pay atthe rate of  1,200 a year, the award being noted in due course in the appropriation Account; to reject Admiral Hughes Halletfs claimoutright; or to attempt to settle the claim on the basis of a lump-sum payment.The Cabinet were informed that it was an open question whetherthe Admiral would succeed in establishing in the courts a legal claimto damages by reason of the inaccurate advice which he had receivedfrom the Naval Secretary to the First Lord. There was, however, nodoubt that he had been misled and there were precedents for makingextra-statutory payments in such cases. On the other hand, the admiral had not availed himself of the other means which had been available to him of confirming the accuracy of the information whichhe had received. It had also been open to him, after the true factshad been brought to his attention, to withdraw from his Parlia-mentary candidature before the adoption stage, and to complete theperiod of service which would have entitled him to retired pay of 1,200. It could reasonably be assumed, therefore, that he had then been prepared to forego the additional money which he was nowclaiming. The view was expressed that the damage which he wouldhave suffered by withdrawing from his Parliamentary candidaturebefore the adoption stage would not, in fact, have been serious.48413-2b 2.
Discussion showed that on the question what course should nowbe followed opinion in the Cabinet was divided. On the one hand,there was support for the view that, having regard to the legaluncertainty, the Government would be justified in seeking to settle the claim by means of a lump-sum payment, and that Admiral HughesHallett might well be prepared to settle on a fifty-fifty basis. If the government&apos;s action in settling the claim were challenged, it wouldbe open to them to state that they had acted on the advice of the LawOfficers. On the other hand, serious doubts were expressed about the propriety of making any payment in such circumstances, particularly to a Member on the Government side of the House, except in-consequence of a decision against the Crown. Among those who held this view some considered that publicity should be avoided byreferring the matter to an independent arbitrator, acceptable to bothsides, each of whom would undertake to abide by his decision.It was suggested that a final decision should be deferred untilthe Lord Chancellors advice could be made available, to the Cabinet.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their consideration of this question attheir next meeting.Social Services.        4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor(Previous of the Exchequer (CP. (55) 57) drawing attention to the growing costReference: of the social services and proposing that the Treasury should prepare,CC. (S3) llth for the consideration of the Cabinet, a survey showing what the costConclusions. of these services would be over the next five years if existing policyMinute 8.) remained unchanged.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) In paragraph 2 of CP. (55) 57 it was stated that over thepast five years Government expenditure on social services had risen by 35 per cent., as contrasted with an increase of only 25 per cent,in the gross national product. Doubts were expressed about the validity of this comparison. It was argued that, while expenditureon investment could properly be related to the gross national product,social service benefits were to a large extent transfer payments whichhad little relation to productivity. Expenditure on social services should rather be related to taxable capacity. If prices continued torise, the Government would be under heavy pressure to increasesocial service benefits. There was a point beyond which they couldnot accept an increasing disparity between the position of wage-earners and that of pensioners and others living on fixed incomes.(b) It might be useful to forecast the course of government expenditure on social services over the next five years on theassumption that no changes were made in existing policy. This,however, should be only a first stage. For it was unrealistic to suppose that there would be no changes in existing policy over thatperiod. The next stage would be to consider what changes of policy were desirable and to what extent they would be financially practic-able over the next five years. In education, for example, it was desirable that progress should be made during that period in reducingthe size of classes and in expanding the facilities for technical education. In the National Health Service also some changes ofpolicy would be desired; but it was difficult to forecast precisely what changes would need to be made over the next five years.(c) Consideration would shortly have to be given to the futurelevel of housing subsidies. In this connection The Minister of housing said that it would be convenient if the Chancellor of theExchequer could postpone the proposed increase in the rate of interest on Public Works Loans. That was likely to provoke demands foran increase in the housing subsidy; and some arguments which could
be used against increasing the subsidy on this account might seeminconsistent with those which might have to be advanced later infavour of reducing the subsidy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would discuss thisquestion with the Minister of Housing. The Secretary of State forScotland said that he would wish to be consulted at an early stageon any proposals for reducing the level of housing subsidies.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in replying to the points madein the Cabinefs discussion, said that he would discuss with theMinisters concerned, before the proposed survey was carried out,what assumptions should be made about changes in policy duringthe period under review. It was important that it should&apos; not become known that such a survey was being made; but, subject to the needfor secrecy, he would wish that there should be the fullest practicableinter-departmental consultation in making these estimates..The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for a survey to be made, in consultation with the Departmentsconcerned, of the probable course of Government expendi--ture on the social services over the next five years.5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the colonial secretary (CP. (55) 59) suggesting that the constitutional aspects ofthe proposals for closer association between Malta and the UnitedKingdom should be examined by a special conference, which would include representatives of all the political Parties in the parliament at Westminster and would call into consultation representatives ofthe political Parties in the Legislative Assembly of Malta.The Colonial Secretary said that, since this note was circulated,he had had some further discussion with the Prime Minister aboutthe terms in which the decision to convene such a conference shouldbe announced, and he had prepared a revised draft of the proposed announcement. Copies of this revised draft were handed round at------the meeting_________In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Though the conference should first examine the proposal forMaltese representation in the Parliament at Westminster, it shouldbe open to them to consider other means of satisfying the consti-tutional aspirations of the Maltese people. The terms of reference of the conference should be wide enough to cover this.(b) It should also be open to the conference to take into account the possibility that other small Colonies which could not aspire to full Commonwealth membership might also demand representation at Westminster.(c) The constitutional aspects of the proposal could not be examined in isolation. The conference would have to consider whatwould be involved in Malta&apos;s representation at Westminster. would it be possible, for example, to impose the same level of taxation in malta as in the United Kingdom? Would it be reasonable thatthe same level of social services should be available in the twocountries? Consideration of the constitutional proposal would leadinevitably to examination of these wider implications. The conferencemust be able to take them into account.(d) The conference would be modelled on the Round table conference which had considered Indian reforms between the. wars.This would be preferable to an enquiry by a Joint Select Committeeof the two Houses of Parliament. For the Government would retain control over the composition and the procedure of such a conference,and could more easily arrange for it to take due account of thefinancial and administrative considerations involved.Malta.(previous reference:CM. (55) 19thConclusions,Minute 10.)
In the course of the Cabinefs discussion doubts were againexpressed about the long-term consequences which might flow froma decision that Malta should be represented in the Parliament at westminster. It was, however, recognised that the Governmentwould at once be faced with a very difficult situation in Malta ifthis Maltese proposal were rejected out of hand. In these circum-stances there was general agreement that an immediate announcement should be made of the Governments decision to convene a special conference to examine the proposal.In discussion of the draft announcement various amendments were suggested and approved. It was finally agreed that the decision should be announced in. the following terms:  &apos;. &quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government welcome the initiative of the maltese Prime Minister in putting forward proposals for a closer association between Malta and the United Kingdom. They feel sure that in all parts of the House there will be a sympatheticresponse to the suggestion that the two peoples should draw,more closely together.. &quot; The administrative, financial and constitutional aspects ofthese proposals are closely linked. The administrative andfinancial aspects are at present under discussion with the maltese government Delegation. On the constitutional side, there is included a proposal that Malta, while retaining its own Legisla-tive Assembly, should in future be represented in the parliament at Westminster. The Government feel that all sections ofpolitical opinion in Parliament should have an opportunity toconsider, and express their views upon, a new constitutional development of such importance as this. They therefore proposeto convene a Round Table Conference, comprising representa-tiyes of all the political Parties in the Parliament at Westminster,to consider constitutional questions arising from the proposals.This Conference will meet during the summer recess. It will callinto consultation representatives of the political Parties in theLegislative Assembly of Malta.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a Round Table Conference should be convenedto consider the constitutional aspects of the proposals putforward by the Maltese Government for a closer association between Malta and the United Kingdom.(2) Took note that, after consultation with the Leaders of thetwo Opposition Parties in the House of Commons, thePrime Minister would announce this decision in the terms set out above in a statement in the House of commons on 6th July. .(3) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to communicate thesubstance of this announcement to the leaders of the two main political Parties in Malta, who were now in London,shortly before the announcement was made.Industrial 6. The Minister of Labour said that, now that the dock strikeDisputes. had come to an end, he proposed to proceed with the appointmentDocks. of a committee of enquiry to examine the working of the Dock(Previous Labour Scheme. He would also bring pressure to bear on the reference: Secretary-General of the Transport and General Workers Union toCM.

Unless this were done effectively, it was most unlikely that minute 8.) the 10,000 dissident stevedores and dockers in the northern portswould rejoin this union.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.
JMrs. Nunn May,(previous reference:C.C. (53) 80thConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (55) 60) about an application by the wife of Dr. AlanNunn May for a passport to enable her to travel to Austria on holiday. It was stated in the memorandum that it might beMrs. Nunn May&apos;s real intention to reclaim Austrian nationality and remain in Austria in the hope that her husband would be allowedto join her there on compassionate grounds. From Austria theycould both defect to a country behind the Iron Curtain. Defectionby Dr. Nunn May would be likely to prejudice Anglo-american relations generally and, in particular, the completion of the civil andmilitary agreements between the two countries on the exchange of atomic information. These agreements had been signed on 15th Junebut nad to lie before Congress for a period of 30 days thereafter.The Cabinet agreed that no passport should be issued toMrs. Nunn May before 18th July, when this period of 30 days wouldbe completed. Meanwhile arrangements might be made forMrs. Nunn May to be interviewed in order that a judgment mightbe formed on the question whether she intended to do no more thanvisit her relations in Austria or whether she had some ulterior motivein seeking to make this journey.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no passport should be issued to Mrs. Nunn Mavbefore 18th July.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider what further steps might be taken to enable him to form a better judgment on the question whether Mrs. Nunn May had someulterior motive in making this application for the grantof a British passport.Registers of electors.(previous reference:CM.

(55) 58) onthe question whether legislation should be undertaken to reintroducea second annual revision of the registers of electors.In discussion there was support for the view put forward in cp.
