Parliament 1.   The Cabinet had a preliminary discussion of the business which might be taken in the House of Commons during the following week, subject to satisfactory progress being made with the finance bill.It was proposed provisionally to arrange for a debate on theFortnight Rule and it was agreed that further consideration shouldbe given to the request put forward by the Opposition for a debate onthe Middle East. It was noted that any statement which theGovernment might feel obliged to make on the course of events in cyprus could be expected to provoke a request for an immediatedebate on the Governments policy.It was agreed after discussion not to attempt to shorten theCommittee Stage of the Finance Bill by introducing a guillotinemotion on 28th November. It was felt that, in spite of theobstructionist tactics being pursued by the Opposition, this procedure,which was last invoked for a Finance Bill in 1931, was constitutionallyinappropriate for a Bill of this nature, especially when the Govern-ment had a satisfactory majority. It was recognised that, if theCommittee Stage of the Bill continued beyond the end of the following week, there was some risk that its remaining stages would not becompleted before the Christmas recess.Betting, 2.   The Cabinet were informed that a Private Member&apos;s BillLotteries introduced by Mr. Ernest Davies, M.P., to authorise small lotteriesaosd Gaming, and small card and gaming parties subject to the conditions(Previous recommended by the Royal Commission on Betting, Lotteries and reference: Gaming, was due to receive its Second Reading in the House ofC.C. (54) 11th Commons on Friday, 25th November.Conclusions,Minute 9.) The Home Secretary said that when an almost identical measurehad been introduced in the last session by Sir Eric Errington, M.P.,there had been some criticism of the Government for failing to bring in a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of the RoyalCommission and for adopting an unnecessarily cautious attitudetowards a Private Member&apos;s Bill which attempted to remedy some ofthe defects in the law.In discussion there was support for the view that, as the present law on the subject of small lotteries and gaming was manifestlyunsatisfactory, it would be right for the Government not to putimpediments in the way of a Private Member&apos;s Bill which sought toimprove it. It was therefore agreed that it should be made clear toGovernment supporters that the Government did not wish to oppose the Bill. This would leave individual members free to vote accordingto their consciences or to abstain, as they wished.The Cabinet-Agreed that it should be made clear to government supporters that the Government did not wish to oppose theSmall Lotteries and Gaming Bill introduced in the House ofCommons by Mr. Ernest Davies, M.P.Broadcasting. 3.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the arrangementsfor a debate in the House of Commons on the question of restricting the broadcast discussion of issues about to be debated in Parliament,and considered the terms of a motion which the Government might put down.It became clear in discussion that there were difficulties in drafting a motion which would be satisfactory from the Governmentspoint of view and at the same time acceptable to the labour opposition.  It would no doubt help to secure the agreement of the49168-2 B 2The fortnight rule.(previous reference:CM. (55) 41stConclusions,Minute 2.)
Opposition if the terms of the motion included a proposal that a SelectCommittee should be appointed to consider whether any changesmight be desirable in the present practice. There were no serious objections in principle to the appointment of a Select Committee andto include a reference to it in the terms of the motion would, to someextent, anticipate Opposition pressure on the matter. But the fact remained that the Prime Minister had, in answer to a parliamentary question, refused to agree to the appointment of a Select Committee,and to put forward a motion which provided for it would create anunjustified impression that the Government had felt compelled to give way on the point.It was agreed in further discussion that the preferable coursewould be to treat the subject as one on which the Government were anxious to obtain the views of the House and to allow the debate totake place on the Motion for the Adjournment. This course would,however, require the agreement of the Opposition Leaders.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to be guid ;d by the sense of their discussion in attempting to make arrangements with theLeaders of the Opposition for a debate on the fortnight rule.capital punishment.(previous reference:CM. (55) 35thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet considered the line which should be taken inreply to a Parliamentary Question which had been put down byMr. S. Silverman, M.P., for answer by the Prime Minister on24th November. The Question sought information on the steps whichthe Government proposed to take to ascertain the present state ofpublic opinion as to the death penalty, in view of the Governmenfsrefusal to grant time for the discussion of the Bill which Mr. Silvermanhad introduced, and the belief that there had been a swing of publicopinion in favour of abolishing the death penalty.The Home Secretary said that although there had been a renewal of propaganda on this subject there was no evidence of any changein public opinion in regard to it. On the other hand, the receptionaccorded to Mr. Silverman&apos;s Bill had shown the widespread concernfelt in the House of Commons on the subject of the death penalty.An unremitting pressure for the further discussion of this matter could now be expected.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) The fact that a new House of Commons had been electedsince the question of the death penalty had been last debated couldbe regarded as sufficient grounds for the further discussion of amatter of such importance.(h) Although there had been in February a majority of 36against the suspension of the death penalty for five years, it must beconsidered doubtful whether there would be a majority in the newHouse of Commons for the maintenance of the death penalty.(c) It was unlikely that time could be found for a debate beforethe Christmas recess.It was agreed that, in these circumstances, it would be rightto say, in reply to Mr. Silverman, that the Government were notopposed in principle to a further debate on the question of capital punishment but that it would not be possible to find time for sucha debate in the near future. It was also agreed that, in preparation for such a debate, it would be necessary for the Government again to consider their policy in the matter, and the Home secretary undertook to circulate a memorandum which would serve as a basis for discussion.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in reply to a Parliamentary Question on24th November, the Prime Minister should state that theGovernment were not opposed in principle to the holding of a further debate in the House of Commons on thequestion of capital punishment, but that it would not bepossible to find time for such a debate in the near future.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to circulate a memorandum toserve as a basis for the further discussion of theGovernments policy in this matter.

implications of full employment.(previous reference :CM. (55) 39thConclusions.Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (55) 173) covering a revised draftof the White Paper on the Implications of Full Employment and seeking approval for its publication.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the White Paper wasnot an exhortation for restraint in wage claims and dividenddistribution, but explained the problems of achieving and maintainingrelative price stability as an essential factor in the maximumexpansion of a balanced economy.   The White Paper deliberatelyadopted a long-term approach to this question and, in presenting the facts, had been drafted as impartially as possible.   It mightnevertheless attract some political criticism, for example on the three points mentioned in paragraph 3(c) of CP. (55) 173.   The mostimportant section of the White Paper (Section VI) recognised thatit was inevitable that productivity should increase faster in somesectors of the economy than in others, and it explained the needfor the benefits of the increase in productivity in those sectors whereit was most substantial and rapid to be shared by way of lower prices with the other sectors of the economy.It was not likely that the White Paper would attract muchpopular attention, but it could serve an important educative purpose.The best time to publish it would be after the Finance Bill had been passed, at about the middle of December.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat publication of the White Paper would be useful as a contributionto the education of public opinion in the problems created by full employment. The Cabinet were informed that a popular versionwas in course of preparation. It was suggested that the lessonscontained in the White Paper should also be expounded by ministers in speeches in the near future.-The Minister of Education said that the most effective methodof disseminating the lessons of the White Paper would be throughdiscussion groups. He undertook to try to get the White Paperadopted as a basis for discussion by adult education organisations.As regards the time of publication, it was pointed out that itwas desirable that the White Paper should have been published beforethe forthcoming wage negotiations had reached a delicate stage. Onthis account, the White Paper, and also the popular version of it,should if possible be published on 8th December.On the content of the White Paper the following suggestions were made:   f(a) The President of the Board of Trade said that it might be emphasised that since 1938 the real value of dividends had decreased
by one-third, while the real value of wages and salaries had increasedby one-third.(h) The Lord Chancellor suggested that the White Paper should contain a final summary of the main points and lessons in it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would consider these points, together with any others which Ministers might wishto send to him.The Cabinet Agreed that the draft White Paper attached to CP. (55) 173,subject to any amendments approved by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, should be published if possible on 8th December, and that a popular version of it should bepublished at the same time.Cyprus.(previous reference:CM. (55) 37thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Colonial Secretary said that on the previous day theGovernor of Cyprus had presented to Archbishop Makarios a formula, in terms approved by the Committee on Colonial Policy,setting out the considered attitude of the United KingdomGovernment towards the constitutional development of Cyprus. the archbishop had rejected the formula, on the grounds that it did not recognise the right of self-determination for the people of Cyprus.The Archbishop had, however, agreed to leave to the Governor thequestion how and when an announcement should be made about their meeting, the publication of the formula, and the fact thatthe Archbishop had rejected it. The Governor had recommendedthat such an announcement, in terms which he had suggested, shouldbe issued simultaneously in London and Cyprus on 23rd November.The Greek Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, to whom theformula had also now been disclosed had, however, felt that it wasa constructive advance, and had suggested that the discussions between the Governor of Cyprus and the Archbishop should be prolonged if possible, so that the views of the Greek Governmentcould be made known to the Archbishop. The Greek ministers had also suggested that the King of Greece, who was at present inParis, might usefully intervene.The Colonial Secretary recommended that the text of theformula, and the fact (hat the Archbishop had rejected it, shouldnot be made public for (he time being, pending consideration of means of enabling the influence of the Greek Government lo bebrought to bear on the Archbishop. It would, in any case, benecessary to consider how the draft announcement proposed by theGovernor should be amended.The Prime Minister said that, in view of the reaction of theGreek Government lo the formula which had been presented to the archbishop, it was clearly desirable not to make the Archbishop&apos;srejection of it public for the time being. It was also desirable toconsider very carefully the terms of the announcement which wouldhave to be made eventually, if it proved impossible to alter the archbishop&apos;s attitude.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the Governor of Cyprus should be informed that no announcement of the formula, or the Archbishop&apos;s rejection of it,should be made for the time being. It was also agreed that.M. Ambassador in Paris should explain the formula and thegeneral policy of the United Kingdom Government to the King of greece, with a view to his intervention at a suitable time.
The Cabinet-CDInvited the Colonial Secretary to instruct the Governor of cyprus that no announcement about the formula shouldbe made for the time being.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to arrangefor H.M. Ambassador in Paris to explain the formula to the King of Greece.(3) Took note that the Colonial Policy Committee would consider the form of any announcement about theformula which might become necessary, and the questionof policy in Cyprus generally, at their meeting on24th November.NatiomiaJAssistance(previous references :CM. (55) 41stConclusions,Minute 10, and cc. (52) 37thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Minister of Pensions said that the Chairman of theNational Assistance Board had intimated that in his view there shouldbe an increase of 4,y. 6d. in the rate of assistance for a single person,with appropriate increases in the other rates of National Assistance,because of the rise in the cost of living. Before the Board made a formal recommendation, he wished to indicate to the Chairmanwhat increases the Government would regard as reasonable, witha view to dissuading the Board from recommending increases whichthe Government could not accept. : *&apos;&quot;&quot;&quot;The Minister of Pensions said that the minimum increase that could in practice be granted would be 25. 6d. for a single person.Of this, however, \s. 6d. would be needed, in view of the currentincrease in the cost of living, to restore the value of the scaleestablished last February. An increase of 2s. 6d. was thereforehardly adequate to meet likely further increases in the cost of living.He therefore recommended that he should indicate to the Chairmanof the Board that the Government would accept an increase of 3s. 6d.in the rate for a single person, with appropriate increases in the otherrates. If this were done, there would be a good hope of avoidingapplications for further increases for a considerable period.The Chairman might well not be able to persuade the Board torecommend an increase as low as 3s. 6d. If the Board wereto recommend an increase which the Government could not accept,their recommendations, together with the Governmenfs reasons for refusing to accept them, would have to be published.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was disappointingthat although the Government, in order to mitigate the increase in thecost of living, had decided not to abolish the bread subsidy, theNational Assistance Board were now in any event pressing forincreased rates of assistance. He hoped therefore that the increasein the scale for a single person would not be more than 2s. 6d.Increases on this basis would maintain the value of the scalesestablished last February until the Retail Prices Index rose to158 points, and would therefore provide a sufficient margin for thetime being. Even this increase would cost the Exchequer   12 millions.In discussion it was suggested that if the increase in the rate fora single person were now limited to 2s. 6d., this would leave open thepossibility of a further increase if it were decided to take some actionlater to relieve the Exchequer, such as the abolition of the bread subsidy, which would have the effect of further increasing the cost ofliving. There was a likelihood that in any event the Retail prices index would show a further rise over the next few months, but this might not be so substantial as to absorb the whole value of an increaseof 2s. 6d.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, although the cost ofan increase in National Assistance scales was substantial, aconsiderable saving had already been effected in the cost of national assistance since the spring.
Further discussion showed that it was the general view of theCabinet that the Minister of Pensions should indicate to the Chairmanof the National Assistance Board that in the Governments view theincrease in the scale of assistance for a single person should be no more than 2s. 6d. and to express the hope that the Board could be persuaded to limit their recommendations to increases on this basis.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Pensions to inform the Chairman ofthe National Assistance Board that in. the governments view the increases in the scales of National Assistance shouldbe on the basis of not more than 2s. 6d. for a single person.Egypt.High Damat Aswan.(previous reference :CM. (55) 40thConclusions,Minute 5.)9. The Cabinet were informed of the progressnegotiations for the financing of the Aswan High Dam.of  theThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Mr. Black, thePresident of the International Bank, had now suggested that a working party should be set up under a Chairman appointed by the Bank, onwhich the United Kingdom, United States and Egyptian governments would be represented. This might help to persuade the egyptian government to look to the West for the help necessary to carry outthe project. It might still be desirable at a later stage to seek theco-operation of the United Slates Government in pressing Mr. Blackto provide Bank support for the project without insisting on some ofthe conditions which he was at present inclined to think were necessary. There was a danger, as was clear from the views whichColonel Hilmi, the Egyptian co-ordinalor in charge of the High Damproject, had expressed in Paris, that the Egyptian Government might still turn to the Russians if they found that they were unable to makesatisfactory arrangements for credit if the contract were awarded tothe consortium of European firms.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the Government should express their willingness to take part ina working party under the aegis of the International Bank, even if this meant that it would be more difficult to avoid some commitmenttowards the financing of the project, in addition to being prepared to release Egypt&apos;s sterling balances.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for thePresident of the International Bank to be informed thatthe United Kingdom Government would support theestablishment of a working party on the Aswan High Damproject.
Further discussion showed that it was the general view of theCabinet that the Minister of Pensions should indicate to the Chairmanof the National Assistance Board that in the Governmenfs view theincrease in the scale of assistance for a single person should be no\more than 2s. 6c/.&apos; and to express the hope that the Board could be persuaded to limit their recommendations to increases on this basis.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Pensions to inform the Chairman ofthe National Assistance Board that in the governments view, the increases in the scales of National Assistance shouldbe on the basis of not more than 2s. 6d. for a single person.Egypt-High Damat Aswan.(previous reference:CM. (55) 40lhConclusions,Minute 5.)9.
