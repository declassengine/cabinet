remuneration of ministers and Membersof Parliament.(previous references:CC. (54) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2, and cm. (55) 17thConclusions,Minute 7.)1. The Cabinet were informed that the Leader of the opposition had asked to see the Prime Minister to discuss the remuneration ofMinisters and of Members of Parliament. There was reason tobelieve that the Opposition might ask that, if improvements were tobe made in the remuneration of Ministers, the attendance allowancepayable to Members should also be raised. On the other hand, theOpposition had already committed themselves publicly to the viewthat some increase in Ministers&apos; remuneration was desirable.The Prime Minister said that he did not propose to give any encouragement to the idea that further improvements might be madein Members&apos; emoluments at the present time.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet agreed that the Government would have to find time,before the summer recess, for a preliminary discussion in the Houseof Commons on the Report of the Monopolies Commission oncollective boycott and exclusive dealing, which had been published that morning. As, however, a comparatively short time would have elapsed since the publication of the report, the Government would bejustified in giving only a broad indication of their attitude to its recommendations, and they might undertake to consider the matter further in the light of views expressed in the debate.nationalised industries.SelectCommittee.(previous reference:CC. (54) 44thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Lord Privy Seal said that Members appointed in the last session to the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries wereurging on him the need for amendment of the Committee&apos;s terms ofreference. He proposed to take the line that the Government saw no reason to change the terms of reference at this stage but that, ifthe Committee should finally conclude that they needed amendment,a report in that sense should be submitted to the House.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement.South Africa.defence -operation.(previous reference:CM. (55) 18thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Minister of Defefice said that the discussions with theSouth African Minister of Defence had now been brought to asatisfactory conclusion. The results of the discussions were to be announced simultaneously in both countries on 4th July, and the texts of the agreements reached would be published that afternoon in theform of a White Paper. The Cabinet would wish to consider whether an advance copy of the White Paper should be sent to the Leader ofthe Opposition.The Cabinet agreed that the Minister of Defence should seethe Leader of the Opposition, and give him an advance copy of theWhite Paper, shortly before the announcement was made in theHouse of Commons on 4th July.Germany.supplementary estimate forMilitaryExpenditure.5. The Cabinet considered whether a Supplementary Estimateshould now be presented to Parliament in respect of expenditure onthe maintenance of United Kingdom Forces in Germany.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this question arosethrough the termination of the occupation regime on 5th May. Therewas a fair prospect that, in the current financial year, expenditure
would be wholly met by the German contribution, and anysupplementary estimate taken would therefore be for only a tokenamount. Technically, however, a supplementary estimate was required in order to establish Parliamentary control of expenditure;and, if it were not taken, there were likely to be difficulties later on with the Comptroller and Auditor-General and the Public accounts committee. The presentation of a token supplementary estimatehardly seemed likely in itself to prompt the Opposition to ask fora debate.In discussion there was some support for the view that the presentation of a supplementary estimate should be deferred for aslong as possible. Thus, it could be argued that, if the estimates should cover support costs now, they should have covered occupation costs in earlier years and that by presenting a supplementary estimate for this purpose now the Government would merely draw attention tothe earlier omission. It also seemed possible that, if presentation of a supplementary estimate were to lead to a debate, views mightbe expressed which would make it harder for the German federal government to pay over the sums in support of our forces which were expected of them.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofDefence to consider further, in the light of the cabinets discussion, the timing of a first estimate in respect of the costof maintaining United Kingdom Forces in Germany afterthe end of the occupation period.Foreign Affairs. 6. The Foreign Secretary made a brief report to the Cabineton his recent visit to the United States. The Administration were,he thought, adopting a more flexible attitude towards the majorinternational problems of the day. They were evidently anxious tomake progress, at the Four-Power Talks, towards a solution ofEuropean problems. In particular, they were likely to look favourablyon realistic proposals for reducing the level of armaments in Europe.The attitude of the Administration towards the Far East had alsochanged. They were more anxious to find a peaceful solution thanthey had been a few months previously, though they were still findingit difficult to. extricate themselves from the position which they hadtaken up. In the Far East the main risk was that the chinese communists might make some ill-judged move. It should,therefore, be our aim to maintain the exchange of views which was proceeding, through intermediaries, in the hope that means might befound of advancing gradually towards a peaceful settlement.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.administrative tribunals.(previous reference:CM. (55) 17thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposals, putforward by the Lord Chancellor in CP. (55) 44, for establishingan independent enquiry into practice and procedure in relation to administrative tribunals and quasi-judicial enquiries.The Lord President recalled that, when the Cabinet had previously discussed these proposals, doubts had been expressed bothon the scope and on the composition of the proposed enquiry.These doubts had been largely removed by discussions which theLord Chancellor had subsequently held with the Ministers most directly concerned. As regards the scope of the enquiry, it had beenmade clear that the Committee would have quite general terms of
industrial disputes.Docks.(previous reference :CM. (55) 18thConclusions,Minute 9.)8. The Minister of Labour said that the report of the DisputesCommittee of the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) condemned theNational Amalgamated Stevedores and Dockers (N.A.S.D.) forpoaching in the northern ports and ruled that the 10,000 members which the N.A.S.D. had acquired there must cease to belong to thatunion. It condemned both the N.A.S.D. and the Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union (T.G.W.U.) for poaching each other&apos;smembers in London and advised them to meet to resolve the situation there. The T.U.C.&apos;s statement, which endorsed the Committee&apos;sreport, recognised that the dispute was one between the two unions,and recommended that it should be settled by acceptance of theCounciTs advice and that the strike should be called off.The Minister said that these conclusions seemed unlikely tosecure an early resumption of work. While it was true that theN.A.S.D. had undertaken beforehand to accept the T.U.C.&apos;s findings,there was a disposition in the northern ports, particularly onMerseyside, to continue the strike in pursuit of recognition by theemployers. In any event it was clear that the N.A.S.D. members innorthern ports would not voluntarily rejoin the T.G.W.U. It waspossible that they might form a new union of their own or mightabandon union membership altogether.The Minister said that he proposed to discuss with the T.U.C.whether there was any further step which he could take at the moment in his efforts to resolve the situation. He would also see theSecretary-General of the T.G.W.U. and representatives of the port employers. It would be difficult for him to make contact with theN.A.S.D. as within a few days none of its leading officials seemed likely to be in office.In discussion it was explained that the attitude of the T.G.W.U.could hardly be expected to become more reasonable seeing that,broadly speaking, their case had received the endorsement of theT.U.C. If the port employers were to accord recognition to theN.A.S.D. in northern ports, the T.G.W.U. might well resort to strike action themselves.The Prime Minister said that the Minister of Labour should letit be known that he was holding further consultations with the partiesto this dispute, so as to show that the Government were continuing to do all in their power to end the strike. It would also be helpful if Ministers would take any suitable opportunity to emphasise in theirspeeches in the country the serious economic effects of the strike.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.reference, and that Ministers would have an opportunity forcommenting on these before the Committee was appointed. Asregards membership, it was now recognised that the compositionsuggested in paragraph 6 of CP. (55) 44 contained too large an element of official or technical opinion and made insufficient provisionfor reflecting the views of the public. Ministers would, however, bebetter able to determine the composition of the Committee on thebasis of a list of names than on a general indication of the types of experience to be represented; and it was now proposed that a listof suitable names should be submitted for consideration by theCabinet.In discussion it was suggested that the Committee should include some members with experience of the kind of administrative problems which were involved.The Cabinet-Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for detailed proposals to be prepared, for consideration by theCabinet, on the composition and terms of reference of theproposed Committee on practice and procedure in relation to administrative tribunals.
Europe 9.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of theEconomic       Exchequer (CP. (55) 55) on a recent conference at Messina of the integration      six member countries of the European Coal and Steel Community(E.C.S.C.).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at Messina the six E.C.S.C. countries had resolved to make further advances towardsthe economic unification of Europe, and to invite the United KingdomGovernment to take part in the work of a Preparatory Committee.Some of the specific objectives of the six Powers set out in paragraph 3of the report attached to CP. (55) 55 for example, the creation of acommon organisation for the peaceful development of atomic energy and the establishment of a common market in Europe seemed likelyto involve duplication with other arrangements or were fraught withspecial difficulties. He therefore recommended that we should agreeto take part in the work of the proposed Preparatory Committee asobservers only, and subject to suitable reservations about our attitude to the specified objectives.In discussion support was expressed for the view that the utmostcaution was required on our part in relation to the specified objectives of the six E.C.S.C. countries. It was suggested, on the other hand,that we ought not to create the impression that we disapproved oftheir efforts to promote a greater measure of economic integrationbetween themselves.The Foreign Secretary said that, while we should preserve our full freedom of action and make it clear that we were not in any way committed to joining any body or bodies which might eventually be set up, we might be able to exercise a greater influence in theforthcoming discussions if we were to enter them on the same footing as the other countries concerned and not in the capacity of an observer.If the Cabinet so desired, he would prepare a draft of a reply on theselines to the invitation which had now been received from theNetherlands Foreign Minister, on behalf of the six E.C.S.C. countries,and would discuss this with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet- Authorised the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to settle, in consultation, the terms of the replyto be sent to the invitation to participate in the forthcoming discussions on this subject.Malta.(previous reference:CM. (55) 18thConclusions,Minute 2.)10. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the colonial secretary (CP. (55) 53) on the proposals of the Malta Government for closer association between Malta and the United Kingdom.The Colonial Secretary said that Malta was now at the partingof the ways. It was inevitable that some change should be made in her constitutional status. She could not aspire to independentnationhood, and could not, therefore, expect to become a full memberof the Commonwealth. That being so, she must look to some form of closer association with a stronger Power. If we rejected her suggestion of closer association with us, the possibility could not be excludedthat she would move towards a closer association with Italy. Sucha development would be gravely embarrassing, especially at a timewhen Cypriots were agitating for union with Greece. He was,therefore, disinclined to reject out of hand this Maltese proposal for closer association with the United Kingdom and representation inthe Parliament at Westminster. Outright rejection of this claimwould be the more difficult now that the Labour Opposition in theHouse of Commons had indicated their intention to support it. Atthe same time he recognised that this would be a considerableconstitutional innovation, and that the details would need careful examination.   It would be appropriate that they should be studied
by some independent body. The appointment of a Royal commission would be regarded by the Maltese as a de vice for delaying action.If, however, the Government were willing to indicate that they accepted the principle of Maltese representation in the parliament at Westminster, it would be reasonable that the detailed means of applying the principle should be remitted for study by a speakers conference or a joint Select Committee of both Houses ofParliament.In discussion there was much support for the view that this wasthe right moment for an imaginative gesture which would satisfy theconstitutional aspirations of the people of Malta. Faced as they werewith constitutional difficulties in various parts of the Colonial Empire,the Government could ill afford to risk a serious constitutional crisis in malta. Moreover, when awkward negotiations were to be openedabout Cyprus and criticism might be expected of the forthcomingtransfer of the naval base at Simonstown, it would seem anomalousthat the Government should reject a request by a Colonial peoplefor a closer form of association with this country. Were we toquarrel with the Cypriots because they wanted to leave us andwith the Maltese because they wanted to draw closer towards us ? If it seemed likely that some form of closer association between this country and Malta was inevitable, there was much to be said for welcoming it in principle without delay. The detailed means ofgiving effect to it would need prolonged examination, and there wouldbe ample time to devise such safeguards as were necessary.Meanwhile, however the goodwill of the Maltese people would havebeen secured. If their overture were rejected outright, the two MalteseParties would probably unite in presenting a demand for full independence coupled with a defence treaty and considerable financialassistance from the United Kingdom. It would be inexpedient to provoke such a demand at the present time.On the other hand some Ministers were seriously concerned atthe risks involved in admitting the principle of Maltese representation in the Parliament at Westminster. A Maltese Lobby in the Houseof Commons might be very troublesome. At times when there wasonly a small balance between the two main political Parties at westminster, a few overseas Members might have an influence in domestic affairs which was quite disproportionate to their numbersor to their knowledge or responsibility. Was it not desirable that,before such a novel constitutional expedient was adopted, further thought should be given to the possibility of devising alternativeconcessions which might satisfy Maltese aspirations? If the presentdiarchy had to be abandoned, would it not be possible to appoint a council of Ministers, drawn from both the United Kingdom and malta, to which the Governor would submit recommendations on international or defence questions which were outside the competence of the Malta Government? Such a development could be coupled with generous provisions for financial and economic aid. Theproposals at present before the Cabinet were those which had beenput forward by the Maltese Government. As they stood, they werefull of difficulties. It was evident that much further study was required before a practical plan could be drawn up for closer association between Malta and this country. Was it necessary that, in advanceof this detailed study, the Government should declare their acceptanceof the principle of Maltese representation in the Parliament at westminster? Would it not be preferable to remit the subject for detailed study by a joint Select Committee of both Houses ofParliament, or some other appropriate body, without priorcommitment on the question of principle?The Colonial Secretary said that, while he respected the anxietyfelt by some of his colleagues, he doubted whether he could securethe co-operation of the Maltese in an independent examination oftheir proposals unless the United Kingdom Government had at leastwelcomed those proposals as a valuable contribution towards asolution of the problem of Malta&apos;s constitutional development.  He
fully recognised the need for further examination of the constitutional and practical problems involved; but, if Malta&apos;s goodwill was to beretained, this examination must be carried out on the basis ofGovernment acceptance of the principle underlying the Malteseproposals.In further discussion it was suggested that a possible alternative course would be to convene a more formal conference, modelled onthe Round Table Conferences which had discussed constitutional developments in. India between the wars, to consider means of promoting a closer constitutional association between the twocountries including a link with the Parliament at Westminster. If thiscourse were adopted, an early announcement could be made of theGovernment^ intention to convene such a conference.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to prepare, in the light of their discussion, considered proposals on the procedure to befollowed in the further examination of the Maltese proposalsfor closer association with the United Kingdom; and agreedto resume their discussion of this question as soon as those proposals were available.11. The President of the Board of Trade said that it now seemed likely that, in the postal ballot on the question of Japan&apos;s admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.), japan would obtain enough favourable votes to secure her admission without our help. As it was open to us to record our vote at any time before11th August, and as an immediate vote by us in favour of Japan would meet with criticism at home and almost certainly precipitate a debate on the revised G.A.T.T. in an unfavourable atmosphere, he was infavour of deferring a decision on this question for another two weeks.The Foreign Secretary said that it was by no means certain that japan would secure admission without our assistance. As it wasagreed that it would not be in our interests to do anything to hinderher admission, he still considered that, on balance, our right course was to record our vote in her favour.The Cabinet Agreed to resume consideration of this matter in two weeks&apos;time unless the Foreign Secretary should consider that developments in the situation made an earlier decisionnecessary.Tariff Policy.Japan and theG.A.T.T.(previous reference:CM.
