industrial disputes,Railways.(previous reference:CM. (55) 13thConclusions,Minute 1.)Dock Strike.(previous reference:CM. (55) 9thConclusions,Minute 5.)The Prime Minister said that the dock strike, though less inthe public eye, was probably causing more damage to the national economy than the railway strike. The Trades Union Congress(T.U.C.) had undertaken to handle this situation, which was essentially a dispute between two Unions; but their efforts to settle ithad not so far been effective. He therefore proposed that, as soonas the railway strike was over, he and the Minister of Labour should1. The Minister of Labour said that, in the course of themeeting which he had held on the previous afternoon withrepresentatives of the Transport Commission and of the associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (A.S.L.E.F.), theChairman of the Transport Commission had suggested that a refereeshould be appointed by the Minister to determine the pay increases to be given to drivers and motormen, that both the Unions concerned should agree in advance to accept the referee&apos;s decision and that thestrike notices should be withdrawn as soon as the referee&apos;s decision was made known. It was an essential part of this suggestion that theNational Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.) should concur in theprocedure proposed and should be entitled to give evidence to thereferee. This suggestion had not yet been accepted by A.S.L.E.F.,who were likely to press the point that the referee should also beempowered to determine a pay increase for top-grade firemen; butthey had shown themselves sufficiently interested in the suggestion to warrant consultation with the N.U.R., who had been summoned tothe Ministry of Labour and informed of it late on the previous evening. Further meetings to consider it were being held that morning by the N.U.R. and by the Transport Commission andA.S.L.E.F.; and, if these discussions went well, the Minister himself would hold a joint meeting later in the morning with representativesof the Transport Commission and of the two Unions.The Minister said that he had not known in advance that theChairman of the Transport Commission intended to suggest that thestrike should not be called off until the referee&apos;s decision was made known. This was an unfortunate feature of the plan, since it wouldappear to concede A.S.L.E.F&apos;s claim that they must receivesatisfaction in terms of a cash figure before calling off the strike.On the other hand they would have undertaken, before the referee&apos;decision was made known, to call off the strike; there would be no formal negotiations between the parties while the strike continued;and a great deal would be left for negotiation after the strike hadbeen called off. If, however, the two Unions accepted this suggestion in principle, the Minister proposed to make a strong appeal toA.S.L.E.F. to call off the strike at once instead of waiting until thereferee&apos;s award was made known.In discussion there was general support for the view that, ifthis procedure were adopted, A.S.L.E.F. should be strongly pressed to call off the strike as soon as the referee was appointed. It mightbe possible to secure this by conceding that the referee should beempowered to deal with the pay of top-grade firemen, as well asthat of drivers and motormen. By this offer and other means theMinister of Labour should do his utmost to persuade A.S.L.E.F. tocall off the strike instead of waiting until the referee&apos;s decision wasmade known.In further discussion the point was made that the economic consequences of the railway strike would become progressively more serious if it continued beyond the end of the present week. Therewas in particular reason to fear that, if the strike continued much longer, it might be difficult to restrain miners in some coalfields fromstopping work.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour andof the points raised in the discussion.
see the leaders of the T.U.C. and impress upon them the need for early and effective action to bring about a resumption of work inthe docks.The Minister of Transport said that, since the cabinets discussion on the previous day, there had been two importantdevelopments in the strike of members of the crews of ocean liners.First, the strikers who had left the Ascania (the first liner to beaffected by the strike) were being informed that, as they had left thatship in breach of their articles and had not reported for other duty,they would now be regarded as having left the industry. This action was being taken by the Merchant Navy Establishment Pool, theauthority responsible for organising the labour force of the industry,and it had the full support of the National Union of Seamen. Itwould have the effect that the men concerned would become liable for military service, and the Ministry of Labour would arrange thatthey should without delay be called up for medical examination.This should have a salutary effect on other strikers.Secondly, the Cunard Company had decided on the previous day that the Saxonia should be moved from her berth into the Mersey,despite the fact that a number of stewards were on strike. Becauseof the strike the deck-crew had refused to obey the mastefs orders.This was a more serious matter than breach of articles by desertion;and it was to be hoped that the Cunard Company would takeproceedings against members of the crew who had been guilty ofwilful disobedience of a lawful order.The Cabinet (2) Took note of this statement by the Minister of Transport.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Colonial Secretary (CP. (55) 33) proposing that theUnited Kingdom Government should invite the Governments of greece and Turkey to send representatives to confer with them inLondon in search of a basis for a solution of outstanding differencesover Cyprus.The Foreign Secretary said that he and the Colonial Secretarywere satisfied that any proposals which the United Kingdom aloneput forward for further constitutional advance in Cyprus would be rejected out of hand by the Cypriots, with the encouragement of theGreek Government. If, however, no further move were made, the greeks were certain to raise the matter at the next Assembly of theUnited Nations. We could not hope to be able to evade the issueagain by a procedural device; and, without the support of the UnitedStates Government, on which we could no longer rely, we might be faced with an adverse vote. To avoid this situation, some freshinitiative must be taken. He and the Colonial Secretary recom-mended that this should take the form of an invitation to the greek and Turkish Governments to join us in tripartite discussion of theproblem. The Turkish Government were likely to accept such an invitation. If the Greek Government declined it, this would strengthen our position in the United Nations. If both Governmentsaccepted it, it was contemplated that we should put to the resultingconference a definite proposal for constitutional advance in Cyprus.The precise form of this proposal would need further consideration.Alternatives were set out in the Annexes to CP. (55) 33. If the ideaof a tripartite conference commended itself to the Cabinet, further study of these alternatives would be made with a view to the submission of an agreed plan which the Cabinet could consider beforethe Greek and Turkish Governments were invited to attend theproposed conference in London.
The Colonial Secretary said that he was in full agreement withthe views expressed by the Foreign Secretary. If the Cabinet agreedthat this fresh initiative should be taken, he would welcome the help of some of his colleagues in considering the alternative plans set outin the Annexes to CP. (55) 33.In discussion doubts were expressed about the wisdom of invitingforeign Governments to a conference on the future constitutional development of a British Colony. This might establish a dangerous precedent. Were we ready to concede the right of neighbouringSouth American States to tender their advice to us on problemsof constitutional development in British Guiana or British Honduras?Or would we admit that the Indian Government were entitled to be consulted on the constitutional development of Colonies where therewere substantial Indian minorities? Was there not also a danger that, by inviting the Greek and Turkish Governments to confer with us on this problem, we should increase our difficulties in resisting,as we had consistently resisted hitherto, attempts to involve theUnited Nations in the domestic affairs of sovereign States? our task in defending our Colonial administration against criticism in theUnited Nations would not be made easier by action on our part whichwould be regarded as an admission that two foreign governments had a right to be consulted on the internal affairs of Cyprus.In discussion it was admitted that the proposal put forward in cp. (55) 33 was open to objection on this account. There were,however, ways in which this risk could be reduced. Thus, the invitation to the two foreign Governments could.be phrased in terms which avoided any suggestion that we were ready to discuss questionsof sovereignty. Emphasis could also be laid on the fact that theGovernments with whom we proposed to confer were our co-partners in the North Atlantic Alliance, and that Cyprus was of strategic importance to the members of that Alliance. This initiative, ifsuccessful, should at least have the result of averting further discussion, and probably an adverse vote, in the United Nations.Finally, from the practical point of view, it was evident that no new constitutional arrangements in Cyprus would work smoothly unless they were acceptable to the Greek and Turkish Governments.The Prime Minister said that we should certainly find ourselves in an embarrassing position if this matter came before the united nations again at the next meeting of the Assembly. If it were not for that consideration, he would have preferred to take no furtherinitiative for the present. Greek claims to Cyprus were ill-foundedand we were on strong ground in resisting them. The policy offirmness which we had been following had already had some effect on public opinion in Greece. We had hitherto declined to discuss thisquestion with the Greek Government, and it might be taken as a sign of weakness if. we now offered to consult them on it. He consideredthat, before they approved this proposal for a conference with theGreek and Turkish Governments, the Cabinet should at leastconsider what proposals could be put before the conference if it met.He therefore suggested that in the first instance a small Committee ofMinisters should be appointed to study the alternative plans outlined in the Annexes to CP. (55) 33. Meanwhile, nothing should be said about the possibility of consultation with the Greek and turkish governments, and we should maintain unchanged the attitude whichwe had adopted towards the Greek Government on this question.The Cabinet-Appointed a Committee consisting of Minister of Defence (in the Chair)Commonwealth SecretaryColonial secretary minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Nutting)to consider, in the light of CP. (55) 33, and to report to the-Cabinet, what proposals could be put forward for further constitutional advance in Cyprus.
House of 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeCommons Secretary (C. (55) 74) covering the draft of a House of commons disqualification Disqualification Bill.HillThe Home Secretary explained that the Bill was largely a technical measure designed to consolidate existing law on this subject and to restate it in modern language. The original draft had beenprepared, while the Labour Government was in office, by a committeeof officials under the chairmanship of the then Solicitor-General, SirFrank Soskice, and it had since been revised and brought up to dateunder the supervision of the Home Affairs Committee. The HomeSecretary invited the Cabinet to take decisions on the specific pointsset out in paragraph 5 of his memorandum. Subject to these, he sought authority to seek the concurrence of the Government ofNorthern Ireland in the draft Bill and to discuss it confidentially withrepresentatives of the Opposition with the object of introducing it,if possible, as a substantially agreed measure.In discussion of the questions raised in paragraph 5 of C. (55) 74the following points were made:  (a) Commonwealth and Colonial office-holdersThe Attorney-General said that the proposals on this subject inparagraphs 2-5 of Appendix B to C. (55) 74 seemed likely to createfresh anomalies. Thus, it was suggested in paragraph 2 that theprinciple underlying the proposal to exempt Commonwealth and colonial office-holders from disqualification was that only appoint-ments made by the Government of the United Kingdom were withinthe mischief at which the Bill was directed; but on that basis there seemed to be no logical reason for disqualifying the office-holdersspecified in sub-paragraphs (ii), (hi) and (iv) of paragraph 4. If, onthe other hand, as was also implied in the memorandum, the intention was to exempt only those Commonwealth and Colonial office-holdersfor whom membership of the House of Commons would in practice be physically impossible, there seemed to be no logical reason for theunqualified exemption of officers of statutory corporations in theCommonwealth and Colonies. It was interesting to note that, on thebasis proposed, it would be open for Mr. Niall Macpherson, M.P.,when the Bill had become law, to accept the office which a year agohad disqualified him from Membership of the House. In any event,physical impediments to attendance at Westminster were steadilydiminishing, and it might be embarrassing if, for example, someonefrom one of the Colonies, who might even be ineligible for member-ship of the local legislature, was able to stand for election to theHouse of Commons.(b) Local Government officers the Secretary of State for Scotland said that he dissented fromthe recommendation that the Cabinet should reverse the decision ofthe Home Affairs Committee that the Bill should disqualify the clerks and deputy clerks of all local authorities in Great Britain. Such ageneral disqualification was desired by the associations of localauthorities in Scotland.Some support was expressed for this view.(c) Irish republic the Commonwealth Secretary said that the Government of theIrish Republic would react unfavourably to Clause 1 (l)(e) of theBill, which would have the effect of disqualifying members of the dail from sitting either at Stormont or at Westminster.It was suggested that further examination might show thisdisqualification to be unnecessary. Thus, it seemed unlikely that anymember of the Dail would in practice be prepared to take the oathat Westminster. In any event, was it necessary by using the word&quot; legislature &quot; to disqualify members of the Senate as well as membersof the Dail?
The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to discuss the points notedabove with the other Ministers concerned, and to submit afurther report on them to the Cabinet before proceeding to consult the Northern Ireland Government and theOpposition Parties at Westminster on the provisions of theBill.ColonialInmmiiigrants.(previous reference:CM. (55) 9thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by theHome Secretary (CP. (55) 32) proposing that an independent committee should be appointed to enquire into the problem of restricting immigration of British subjects from overseas into theUnited Kingdom; and (ii) a memorandum by the commonwealth secretary and Colonial Secretary (CP. (55) 31) covering the revised draft of a White Paper summarising the restrictions applicable to the admission of British subjects to other Commonwealth countries andto the Irish Republic.The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the proposal for theappointment of an independent committee of enquiry. Doubts were expressed about the terms of reference and the composition proposed for this in CP. (55) 32. The first purpose of an enquiry should be toensure that the public throughout the country were made aware ofthe nature and extent of the problem: until this was more widelyappreciated the need for restrictive legislation would not be recog-nised. The terms of reference proposed in the memorandum might give the impression that the need for restrictive legislation was taken for granted. As regards the composition of the proposed Committee,the point was made that a body of people selected as representingvarious types of experience might well prove to be all of one mindon the question of racial discrimination. The view was expressed that, if recourse was to be had to a committee of enquiry, it might be preferable to appoint a smaller body, less representative in character,with broader terms of reference.Further discussion showed, however, that there was still somescepticism in the Cabinet about the value of an enquiry into thissubject by an independent Committee. The appointment of aCommittee would be criticised in some quarters as a device fordelaying Government action. And it could not be certain that theCommittee&apos;s report would be such as to rally public opinion insupport of restrictive legislation. An authoritative statement of the increasing volume of immigration, and of the social and economic problems to which it was likely to give rise, might prove a better basis for action. A statement of this kind could be quickly prepared by officials of the Departments concerned. A report on these lines hadbeen prepared some time ago by an Interdepartmental Committeeof officials: there should be no difficulty in bringing it up to date andputting it into a form suitable for publication.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for an Inter-departmental Committee of officials of the departments directly concerned to prepare, in a form suitable for publication, a report on the growing influx into the UnitedKingdom of coloured workers from other commonwealth countries and of the social and economic problems towhich this was giving rise.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this problem in the lightof the report to be prepared in pursuance of Conclusion(1) above.(3) Deferred for the time being a decision on the questionwhether a White Paper should be presented to parliament in the terms of the draft annexed to CP. (55) 31.
tariff policy.Japan and theG.A.T.T.(previous reference:CM. (55) 1stConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Foreign Secretary(CP. (55) 34) and the President of the Board of trade (CP. (55) 37)about the accession of Japan to the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.).The Foreign Secretary said that the Government had to decidenot later than 11th August how they should vote in the postal balloton the question of Japan&apos;s admission to the G.A.T.T. The paperattached to his memorandum concluded that, on an objectiveappraisal, the balance of advantage lay in favour of our voting for japan&apos;s accession. If this view were accepted, we should gainadvantages from an early announcement of our intentions; it would,in particular, help us in obtaining the concessions which we required from the Japanese in the trade and payments negotiations which were about to take place. As he understood the position, it was not opento any Government to abstain in the forthcoming ballot; any government which did not vote in favour of Japan&apos;s admission wouldbe regarded as having voted against it. From no point of view could we afford to run the risk of appearing to have been responsible for japan&apos;s failure to secure admission.The President of the Board of Trade said that, while he agreedthat if would not be in our interests to do anything to hinder Japan&apos;sadmission to the G.A.T.T., it could be argued that we should beill-advised to record a positive vote in favour of Japan until it became clear that such a vote was essential to secure her admission. TheGovernment^ decision to accept the revised G.A.T.T. would haveto come before the House of Commons for approval at an early date and would undoubtedly become more vulnerable to criticism in theHouse if, before the debate, the Government had gone out of their way to vote in favour of Japan&apos;s accession. Our intention to invoke article XXXV of the G.A.T.T. against Japan would only serve toprotect our home trade against Japanese competition. Increases in tariffs which other contracting parties to the Agreement might find it necessary to impose to protect themselves against Japan would haveto be applied equally against us by reason of the G.A.T.T. obligations of non-discrimination; and the Government would be accused ofdeliberately taking action which exposed our export trade to this risk.If further enquiries should show that Japan, with the assistance of theUnited States, was likely to succeed in obtaining the necessary twenty-three votes which would secure her admission without positive help from us, the balance of advantage might be felt to lie in refraining from voting in her favour.The Cabinet inclined to the view that we were likely sooner or later to have to record a vote in Japan&apos;s favour in the forthcomingballot, and that in the circumstances the more dignified and rewardingcourse would be to record such a vote without delay. they recognised, however, that no immediate decision was required andthat further time might reasonably be taken to clarify the votingposition.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their consideration of this matter at anearly meeting.InternationalFinanceCorporation.Privileges and immunities.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (55) 7) seeking approval for the grant of certainimmunities and privileges to the proposed International finance corporation and to members of its staff.The Foreign Secretary recalled that the Economic PolicyCommittee had decided that the United Kingdom should support theproposal for an International Finance Corporation, to be affiliatedto the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, andthat this decision had been announced in the House of Commons on
7th December, 1954. A draft Charter for the Corporation, providingamongst other things for the grant of certain immunities and privileges, had been drawn up by the International Bank; and, before it could be signed on behalf of the United Kingdom, legislation was required. The privileges and immunities which this legislation would confer upon the Corporation closely corresponded to those alreadyenjoyed in the United Kingdom by the International Bank under theOrder in Council of 1946.The Cabinet Approved the grant of privileges and immunities to theInternational Finance Corporation on the lines proposed in cp. (55) 7. .7. The Foreign Secretary said that there were some indications that the Israel Government might be contemplating an incursion intoEgyptian territory near Gaza. Though he had no direct information to this effect, the possibility could not be excluded. He was thereforetaking unobtrusive steps to delay the supply of military equipment to both Jews and Arabs. A comprehensive review had recently beenmade of the supply of arms to Middle Eastern countries, and theresults of that review would be submitted to the Cabinet in thenear future.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14th June, 1955.Israel.(previous reference :C.C.
