NationalService,(previous reference:CM. (55) 33rdConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet had before them a draft of the proposed announcement on the future of National Service. This draft had beenprepared after discussion in the Defence Committee, and incorporatedthe Committee&apos;s recommendations for modification of the obligations to part-time service under the National Service Act.The Prime Minister recalled that, when the Cabinet had discussed this question on 22nd September, it had been contemplated that thedecision would be announced in a statement issued from 10, downing street. On reflection it seemed to him that the decision needed moreexplanation and justification than could suitably be included in a formal statement of that kind; and, subject to the Cabinefs views, he now proposed that it should be announced in the speech which he was making after the Conservative Party Conference at Bournemouth on 8th October.In discussion there was general agreement that the decision could best be announced in a speech, but the question was raised whether it was proper that a decision on a matter of such national importance should be announced in the atmosphere of a party conference. It was the general view of the Cabinet that theGovernment were under no obligation to postpone the announcementof this decision until Parliament had re-assembled and that, as parliament was not sitting, there was no reason why the PrimeMinister should not take the first convenient opportunity of announcing it in a public speech. His speech at Bournemouth wouldnot be made until after the proceedings of the Party Conference hadbeen formally concluded.The Cabinet then considered the terms of the proposed announcement. Various amendments and additions were suggested and approved.In the course of the Cabinefs discussion the following points were also made:  (a) The future role and constitution of the Home Guard were atpresent under review. Some adjustment of the existing organisation would need to be made, in the interests of economy. Decisions onthis question could not, however, be reached in time for them to be announced in the forthcoming statement on the future of NationalService.(b) The Minister of Labour said that he had now received thereport of a limited enquiry which he had instituted into the effect ofNational Service on the youth of the country. The results of this enquiry were reassuring and, subject to the Cabinefs views, he proposed to publish the report when Parliament re-assembled. Hewould arrange for a summary of it to be circulated to the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the suggestions made in their discussion,the terms of the proposed announcement on the future ofNational Service, and took note that the Prime minister would make this announcement in his speech atBournemouth on 8th October.(2) Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for theGovernments of the older Commonwealth countries tobe informed, shortly before the announcement on 8th October, of the modifications to be made in the systemof National Service.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to circulate to the Cabinet asummary of the report of his enquiry into the effect of. National Service on the youth of the country.
Education.Teachers&apos;Superannuation.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 34thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Education(C.P. (55) 138) seeking approval of a new scheme for teachers&apos;superannuation and authority to discuss it with representatives of the teachers and the local authorities.The Minister of Education said that, since this question had lastbeen considered by the Cabinet, further discussions had been held with representatives of the teachers and of the local authorities inorder to place before them the calculations on which a solvent schemeof superannuation must be based. In the revised scheme it was stillproposed that the contribution of the teachers should be raised from5 per cent, to 6 per cent, of salary. This had aroused great oppositionwhen it was first proposed and would not be welcomed now. Butit was essential that the contribution should be increased if the superannuation scheme were to be solvent; and the present proposalsprovided that, in return, the Exchequer and the local authorities, asemployers, would meet all past and future deficits in the pensionaccount. It was to be hoped this feature, which would mean that6 per cent, was the most which the teachers could be called upon topay, would make the new scheme more palatable to them. On theother hand, the local authorities might now object to assuming theburden that would fall upon them, even after taking into account a60 per cent, contribution from the Exchequer, in meeting any futuredeficits in the pension account. It was desirable that the new scheme should be discussed with the teachers and the local authorities inadvance of the triennial review of salaries which was due to takeplace shortly. He could not tell whether it would be possible to reach agreement with either side on the basis of the new7 proposals butlegislation could not be prepared until the discussions had takenplace.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in full agreement with these proposals.The Cabinet Endorsed the proposals put forward in CP. (55) 138 and authorised the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Education to discuss them with representativesof the teachers and of the local authorities.Aerial 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of advertising.     Transport and Civil Aviation (CP. (55) 139) proposing that powers should be taken to control aerial advertising.The Minister of Transport said that he had discussed with theSecretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Housing and representatives of the local authorities the threat to amenities created by the growing practice of advertising from the air. His colleagues and he had agreed that there was a strong case for imposing acomplete ban on commercial advertising from aircraft through loud-speakers. Other forms of aerial advertising, though somewhat less objectionable, should be brought under an effective system of regulation which he would propose to exercise in collaboration withthe local authorities concerned. The Attorney-General was doubtfulwhether powers of control could properly be taken by amendmentof the Air Navigation Order, 1954. If, however, the Cabinet agreed in principle that aerial advertising should be brought under control,the method of assuming control over it could be considered separately. If legislation was necessary, it might be possible toproceed by way of a Private Member&apos;s Bill.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were generally in favour ofthe proposal to bring aerial advertising under control.   There was
London traffic congestion.Park LaneScheme.(previous reference:CM. (55) 26thConclusions,Minute 9.)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Transport (CP. (55) 140) and the Minister of Works (CP. (55) 141)about the scheme for major road improvements to relieve traffic congestion at Hyde Park Corner, Park Lane and Marble Arch.The Minister of Transport said that, in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s decision of 26th July, an examination had been made ofthe possibility of modifying the London County Council (L.C.C)scheme so as to reduce its interference with the amenities of theRoyal Parks. The conclusion reached was that, even with theaddition of a tunnel, the L.C.C. scheme could not be modified in sucha way as to solve the traffic problem adequately at reasonable costwith less interference with existing amenities. It had, however, been assumed hitherto that the Decimus Burton screen at the south-eastcorner of Hyde Park should not be moved. If the possibility of moving the screen were taken into account, it might be possible towork out an alternative scheme; but the.Minister believed that thiswould interfere even more with existing amenities and would involvea further sacrifice of land in the Park.In view of the urgent need to deal with traffic congestion inLondon it was desirable that the L.C.C. scheme, with the tunnel,should be approved without delay. As the L.C.C. had already beenasked to agree to the addition of the tunnel to their original proposals,he would find it difficult to inform them at this stage that a decisionon the scheme must again be postponed until consideration had beenx given to alternatives involving the removal of the Decimus Burtonscreen.The Minister of Works said that the Royal Fine Art Commission,had taken the view that the L.C.C. scheme would involve greatdamage to the amenities of the Parks and had stated that it was not one which they could in any circumstances support. If, however,the removal of the Decimus Burton screen could be entertained, this might make it practicable to evolve an alternative which would beless objectionable from an aesthetic point of view. The Chairmanof the Technical Sub-Committee of the L.C.C. had agreed that theremoval of the screen would open up new possibilities, and the road research Laboratory had estimated that an alternative scheme could then be worked out which would increase the flow of traffic by50 per cent. Such an alternative scheme might obviate the need fora tunnel, thus making it unnecessary to fell the line of trees on thenorth side of the Green Park. In view of the importance of the project these alternatives should be fully considered.In discussion it was argued that the removal of the screen wouldmean that the area to the north of its present site would be formallytaken but of the Park. This might lead in,the end to pressure forthe north and south carriage drives to be made one-way roads and taken out of the Park area. On the other hand, it was argued that49604-3 b 3support for the view that the proposed prohibition should extend, notonly to advertising through loudspeakers, but to all forms of aerialadvertising. A Private Member&apos;s Bill would be a convenient meansof ascertaining whether there would be sufficient Parliamentarysupport for total prohibition of all aerial advertising: :.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that, powers should be sought to prohibitor control aerial advertising.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation toconsider, in consultation with the Attorney-General andthe Minister of Housing and Local Government, whetherthe necessary powers should be sought through a bill introduced by a Private Member.
Japan.Trade andPaymentsNegotiations.(previous reference:CM. (55) 30thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (55) 142) covering a report by officials on theposition reached in the negotiations with Japan for a new trade and payments agreement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, since the negotiations were resumed, the Japanese had come a considerable way to meetthe requirements which the Cabinet had endorsed on 5th Septemberas our objectives in the negotiations. Subject to their agreeing thattheir purchases of sugar from non-sterling sources should be excludedfrom the calculations, their undertakings in regard to their sterlingexpenditure and their assurances on non-discrimination were satisfactory. But the Japanese offers were subject to our agreeingnot to urge the Colonies to restrict their imports from Japan, andalso to our notifying independent sterling area countries that thebalance of payments situation of the sterling area gave no ground for discriminatory restrictions on imports from Japan, and it wastherefore essential that we should secure, in return, at least  2 millionsworth of new quotas for Japanese imports which would be of real value to United Kingdom exporters. To obtain this we should aareeto give Japan an additional quota for an equivalent value of theirthe effective area of the Park was already limited by the roadways,and that the area to the north of the screen was of no great amenityvalue.It was suggested that it was desirable to obtain a considered opinion from the Royal Fine Art Commission on the aesthetic merits of alternative schemes. Hitherto, the Commission had only beenasked to give their view on the original L.C.C. proposals, and hadnot been asked to suggest improvements. Moreover, while it wasnot intended that the existing road programme should be curtailed,the economic situation was such that it was undesirable that aspectacular and expensive scheme should be launched if analternative solution could be devised which would cost less.The Prime Minister said that it would be wrong to give final approval to the L.C.C. scheme, with the addition of a tunnel, until further thought had been given to the alternative schemes which theremoval of the Decimus Burton screen would make possible. , TheMinisters concerned should therefore arrange for an outline scheme,involving the removal of the screen, to be worked out as quickly as possible. It might be helpful if the L.C.C. could join in this workin its later stages. The Cabinet might find it easier to decide whichscheme to adopt if simple models of alternative plans could be madeavailable for inspection. Meanwhile, there was no reason why theMinister of Transport should not inform the L.C.C. that theGovernment recognised the urgent need for major road improvements to relieve traffic congestion in that area, but that they were stillconsidering whether alternatives to, or modifications of, the proposals put forward by the L.C.C. were desirable.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Minister of Housing, the Minister of transport and the Minister of Works to arrange for an alternative scheme involving the removal of the Decimus Burtonscreen to be worked out, and for models of the alternative proposals to be made available, for consideration by theCabinet at a later date.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to inform the LondonCounty Council that the Government recognised the urgent need for major road improvements to relieve traffic congestion at Hyde Park Corner, Park Lane and MarbleArch.
canned salmon; and, if necessary in the last resort, we should evenagree to buy an additional  3 millions of their canned salmon. Weshould also make it a condition of a satisfactory agreement that theJapanese system of determining and allocating the quotas of theirimporters should be improved to ensure that oil companies controlled by the United Kingdom had fair treatment.The President of the Board of Trade said that, while he supported the proposals in CP. (55) 142, the Cabinet should understand thatit would be difficult to justify an agreement on these lines. Such anagreement would mean that Japan would be able at least to maintainher sterling balance of  80 millions. We should be informingindependent sterling area countries that the balance of paymentssituation did not warrant discriminatory action against imports from japan, at a time when we were announcing our inability to fulfil ourobligation to increase the liberalisation of our trade with Europe.Japan would also have unrestricted access to Colonial markets.Moreover, Japan had refused to give us an assurance that she wouldnot seek exclusive quotas for her exports to independent sterling area countries; and it would be open to her to make a bilateral agreementwith Pakistan under which Pakistan would give Japan an exclusivequota for textiles. He therefore proposed that our negotiators shouldwarn the Japanese that, if they subsequently entered into exclusivequota deals, the United Kingdom Government would have to take this into account when the agreement came to be reviewed in sixmonths&apos; time. Moreover, if pressed in Parliament, the Governmentcould say that the Japanese had been told that in our view theagreement made it unnecessary for Japan to enter into exclusive quotadeals.As regards trade quotas, the President of the Board of Tradeproposed that, if the Japanese refused to improve on their presentoffer, we should in reply reduce by  1 million the quota they atpresent enjoyed for exports of grey cloth to the United Kingdom.In discussion there was general agreement that, as regards tradequotas, our negotiators should seek to obtain additional quotas of value to United Kingdom exporters on 3,  &quot; for-  basis in return foran additional quota for Japanese canned salmon. In the last resort,however, in order to secure  2 millions worth of additional quotas of value to our exporters, they should be authorised to agree that weshould buy up to  3 millions more canned salmon. If, however, theJapanese refused to concede more than about  1 million of additionalquotas of value to Our exporters, an equivalent reduction should bemade in the quota for United Kingdom imports of Japanese greycloth.It was also agreed that, although it would not provide anysubstantial safeguard, a unilateral statement designed to preventJapan from obtaining an exclusive quota for textile exports to pakistan should be made on the lines suggested^The Cabinet were reminded that, at their meeting on26th August, they had accepted the recommendation made by theForeign Secretary (in CP. (55) 109) that the question of shippingdiscrimination should not be again raised in the course of the current negotiations for a trade and payments agreement, but that it shouldbe pursued separately through the diplomatic channel and on other suitable occasions. In discussion it was urged that no opportunity should be lost of obtaining satisfactory assurances from the Japaneseon this question, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook toarrange for officials to consider how this objective could best be pursued.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that our negotiators should seek at least  2 millions of new quotas of value to United Kingdom exporters inreturn for an equivalent value of additional quotas for
3^3EconomicSituation.(previous reference:CM. (55) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Prime Minister said that since their meeting on22nd September he had reviewed, in consultation with some of hiscolleagues, the earlier decision that Parliament, should re-assemble on17th or 18th October in order to deal with the economic situation.If the date of re-assembly of Parliament were to be advanced, therewould have to be a formal announcement giving a reason for this change of plan and he was apprehensive about the effect which this might have on public opinion and public confidence. The cabinet had wished to avoid creating an atmosphere of crisis by recallingParliament specially for this purpose in September; and, if dramaticaction was to be avoided, there was much to be said for leavingunchanged the existing arrangements for the re-assemblyof Parliament. He had therefore come to the conclusion that parliament should re-assemble on 25th October, as planned, but thatthe House of Commons should proceed at once, on 26th October, tothe consideration of the Governments proposals for remedying theeconomic situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in full agreement with the view expressed by the Prime Minister. He wouldnimself prefer  that  the  arrangements  for  the re-assembly  of, Parliament should not at this date be changed.Tn further discussion the Cabinet were informed that the loss to the reserves of gold and dollars in September had totalled$112 millions. They were also informed that the preliminary estimates of the trade returns for September were favourable: exports hadbeen fairly well maintained during the month, but there had been a drop in the volume of imports.The Cabinet Agreed that no change should be made in the existing arrangements for the re-assembly of Parliament, but took- note that the House of Commons would be invited to begin,on 26th October, their examination of the Governmentsmeasures for remedying the economic situation.Foreign Affairs. 7. The Foreign Secretary made a brief report to the Cabinet onhis visit to the current meeting of the General Assembly of the united nations. The handling of many of our current international problemshad, he thought, been made more difficult by the accommodatingattitude adopted by the Soviet Government at the Geneva Conference.As a result, other Governments were less disposed to maintain anunquestioning opposition to Soviet suggestions; and the solidarity ofthe anti-Soviet front was in jeopardy. In military metaphor, we had passed from a war of position to a war of movement; Though theprizes might be higher, the tasks of foreign policy were more difficult.These difficulties had been enhanced by President Eisenhower&apos;s illness,which for the moment had paralysed the conduct of United Statesforeign policy. The current meeting of the General Assembly had also beem marred by the action of the French Government in; withdrawing their representatives in protest against the Assembly&apos;sJapanese canned salmon, on a  -for-  basis; and that, ifthey did not succeed in obtaining more than  1 million ofnew quotas, the quota for United Kingdom imports of japanese grey cloth should be reduced by  1 million.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the recommenda-tions made in paragraph 24 of CP. (55) 142.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would arrange for officials to consider further how best to obtainassurances from the Japanese in connection with shipping.
2Middle East.Supply of Arms.(previous reference:CM. (55) 33rdConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Foreign Secretary said it was now known that theEgyptian Government had entered into a contract for the purchase ofarms from the Soviet bloc. There were also indications that theRussians were making overtures for the, supply of arms to SaudiArabia, Syria and possibly other Arab countries. The implications ofthese devolopinents were serious. It seemed likely that, with thesituation in the Far East stabilised and a situation of stalemate inEurope, the Russians were turning their attention to the Middle East.Little information was available about the Egyptian contracts; butthere was no doubt that, given the scale of their military preparedness,the Russians would be able to exceed even the United States in thequantity of obsolescent material which they could, offer withoutdamage to their defensive strength or to their economy. The middle east offered a fruitful field for exploitation of this kind. As betweenEgypt and Israel, we and the United States had been pursuing a policy(through tlie Middle East Arms Co-ordinating Committee but with increasing difficulty because of the defections of the French) aimed atensuring that the supplies obtained by each country would be bothstrictly limited and fairly shared. It would now be necessary toconsider how this new Soviet move could effectively be countered.Both he and Mr. Dulles had spoken to M. Molotov on this subject in New York, without much effect. But he agreed with the PrimeMinisters view that there would be advantage in making a directappeal to the Soviet authorities if this could be done without giving them an opening to press for a discussion of the policy of the Westtowards the Middle East countries. Although the Russians had started to stir up trouble in the area it was not certain that they had done so on the basis of settled objectives and it might be possible to convince them that a fresh outbreak of hostilities between Egypt and israel would represent a real threat to world peace. As regards actiondirected against Egypt, he had come to the conclusion that the rightpolicy now was to accept the existence of the arms contract and to concentrate our efforts on keeping its effect within bounds, e.g., byensuring that no Soviet technicians were admitted. Nasser&apos;sGovernment had no legitimate basis but was maintained by theEgyptian army and depended on its success in providing the army withweapons. It was perhaps unfortunate that our own deliveries of arms to Egypt had been disappointing and behind promise.On the wider Middle East front, we should also take steps tomake it apparent to the other Arab States, e.g., Iraq, that their advantage lay in not responding to Soviet overtures. It would lendweight to this if the United States were associated with the NorthernTier countries and. accepted responsibility for helping them. But thefact that the Iraqi forces were armed with British heavy equipmentcreated a difficulty, for the United States (although they could supplytheir own obsolescent equipment in substantial quantities) could onlyfacilitate the supply of British.types through aid funds which were limited.The Prime Minister said that these developments might seriously affect our interests in the Middle East as a whole. Indeed, theimportance of the developments in Egypt lay in their potential effect upon the other Arab States. Our interests in the Middle East were greater than those of the United States because of our dependence on Middle East oil, and our experience in the area was greater thantheirs.   We should not therefore allow ourselves to be restricteddecision to discuss the situation in Algeria. It was,, however, likely that the French Government would continue to be represented at meetings of the Security Council.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary^ statement.
overmuch by reluctance to act without full American concurrence and support. We should frame our own policy in the light of our interestsin the area and get the Americans to support it to the extent we couldinduce them to do so. Our policy should be based on the need tohelp our acknowledged friends and allies, such as Iraq, and the TrucialStates on whom our oil depended. The United States could well helpby the supply of arms, and President Eisenhower had not seendifficulty in the use of aid funds for this purpose when the subject hadbeen discussed with him at Geneva.The Prime Minister said that he did not know whether theRussians realised how explosive the situation between Egypt and israel was, but he doubted whether they would consider it in their interests that the dispute should escape control. He was therefore infavour of a direct approach to Marshal Buiganin and invited theCabinet to consider the text of a communication which he had prepared. He saw the risk of giving the Russians an opening tosuggest a conference on Middle East affairs as a whole, but he believedthat this risk must be taken. The alternative was to risk the enticementof all the Arab States away from the West. He saw no advantage,now that things had gone so far, in attempting to bring pressure uponthe Nasser regime, e.g., by withholding the release of sterling balancesor obstructing Egyptian policies in regard to the High Dam.The Cabinet were in agreement that a message should be sent bythe Prime Minister to Marshal Buiganin in the terms of the text whichhad been prepared, subject to certain drafting amendments whichwere suggested.In further discussion the following points were also made:  (a) It would be inadvisable to attempt to subject the Nasserregime to overwhelming pressure. It was doubtful whether suchpressure could be made effective and a rebuff would be bad for our prestige in the Middle East.(b) Our policy should be aimed as far as possible at isolatingEgypt among the Arab States. But it was essential that the supply of western arms to the Arab States allied to us should be expedited for,if this were not done, not all of them could be expected to remainstable in face of offers of Russian arms.(c) Public opinion at home would expect the Government to havemade some representations regarding these Russian moves in theMiddle East. It could be made known that a communication hadbeen sent to the Soviet Government. The text of the message neednot, however, be published at this stage.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would send to MarshalBuiganin a message, in the terms proposed, regarding thesupply of arms to Egypt.9. The Minister of Labour said that he had for some time beenfollowing a policy of diminishing progressively the number ofindustrial hostels supported by his Department. He now proposed to announce that the remaining hostels would all be closed within thenext twelve months. This decision might provoke some protests from industry, but he was satisfied that it was fully justified, not only as ameasure of economy but on merits.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.ImdrasteialHostels.
