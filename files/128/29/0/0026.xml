.v     3 v        / , ,-r;   CM. 26 (55)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the provisional arrangementsfor business in the House of Commons in the first week after theend of the summer recess.EconomicSituation.(previous reference:CM. (55) 25 th conclusions,Minule 6.)General.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the statement onthe economic situation which he had made in the House of commons on the previous day had been Well received. He now wished to consult his colleagues on three particular aspects of the speech whichhe would be making when that statement was debated in the Houseof Commons later in the day.First, as regards Government expenditure, he proposed to makeit clear that he did not contemplate any drastic reduction of existing programmes of investment for the benefit of the social services.There would, in. particular, be no interference with present plans forthe building of hospitals or schools.Secondly, he proposed to decline the requests which were beingmade.for a forecast of the future course of Government policy in.respect of the convertibility of sterling. He would at this stageconfine himself to declaring the Governmenfs aim of keeping the dollar value of the pound sterling at about $2-80.Thirdly, as regards public expenditure on housing, he was disposed to say that the number of new houses to be started by localauthorities in 1955 would be about 80 per cent, of the corresponding figure for 1954 and that house-building by local authorities would now be directed mainly to what was needed for slum clearance orfor the relief of congestion in urban areas.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval of the statements which theChancellor of the Exchequer proposed to make, in his speech in the House of Commons, that afternoon, onexchange policy and on investment generally.Housing. As regards housing, doubts were expressed about the expediency(Previous       of making any statement which might provoke debate on housingReferences:     policy before the Government had decided what adjustments should00.(54)85111   be made in the housing subsidy.   The Minister of Housing said that,Conclusions.    with the Cabinefs approval, he had been taking administrativeMinuie2 and    measures to reduce the number of new houses to be started by localCM.(55 ) 24th   authorities; but the full effect of those measures had not yet been conclusions.    brought out by the published statistics and he had been able so farMinuie3.)       to avoid public disclosure of the fact that the number of new houses to be started by local authorities in 1955 would be only 80 per cent,of the number started in 1954.   He would himself prefer that this fact should not be disclosed before Parliament adjourned.   For he hoped that, before Parliament reassembled, the Government wouldhave settled their future policy on housing subsidies.   And, if thesubsidy were reduced, the local authorities would have a financial&apos; incentive to reduce their rate of building and less reliance would need to be placed on the administrative methods for controlling the volumeof local authority building.In discussion the following points were made:  .,,. . (a) It was politically desirable that the annual total of new&apos;1&apos; &apos; houses built should not fall below 300,000. Within that total a larger proportion might be privately built, but the number built by localauthorities should not fall below 200,000.48552-2b 2
ib) If the total was not to fall below 300,000 the volume of localauthority building might have to be adjusted to take account offluctuations in the volume of private building. Was it not possiblethat the policy of credit restriction might reduce the volume ofprivate building? There had recently been a falling off in the numberof houses started with assistance from building societies. It was,however, suggested that this was not so much because people werebeing discouraged, by higher interest rates, from borrowing fromthe building societies. It might rather be because the societies hadless money to put into house building, since some investors werelooking elsewhere for a higher return on their savings. In so faras credit restriction increased savings, the&quot;activities of the building societies might increase.(c) In debate on investment the relevant factor would be thetotal volume of house building rather than the division of that totalbetween local authority building and private building. Jt might therefore suffice to say that the total level had risen far above the target of 300,000 a year; that the Government were taking stepsto bring the annual rate nearer to that target figure; but that it wasnot their policy to allow the rate to drop below that figure.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his references to housing in his speech in the House of Commons that afternoon, to be guided by the views expressed in the cabinets discussion, and particularly by those recorded in paragraph (c) above; and took note that he would settle the precise terms of his statement on this point inconsultation with the Minister of Housing.Malta. 3.   The Prime Minister said that he wished to announce, before(Previous Parliament rose for the summer recess, the composition and termsReference: of reference of the Round Table Conference on Malta.   the cm. (55) 25th Opposition Parties had nominated their representatives, and goodConclusions, progress had been made with the selection of Government supportersMinute3.) to serve as members of the Conference.   Some of these would not,however, be available until the second half of September.The Cabinet were informed that the Maltese representatives werenot anxious to come to London for this purpose before the middleof September. It would probably meet the convenience of allconcerned if the Conference opened on 19th September.As regards representation of the House of Lords, it wassuggested that the Earl of Perth would be a suitable choice as a conservative member of the Conference.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should propose that theConference should open its proceedings on 19thSeptember.(2) Invited the Lord President to ascertain whether the Ear! ofPerth would be willing to serve as a member of theConference.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would announce the composition and terms of reference of the Conferencebefore Parliament rose for the summer recess.
/ fA.Four-PowerTails.(previous reference:CM. (55) 23rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Far East.Europe.4. The Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet the impressionswhich lie and the Foreign Secretary had formed as a result of their discussions with representatives of other Governments at the Four-Power talks in Geneva.The situation in the Far East had not been considered by theConference. It had, however, beet&apos;, the subject of private bilateral discussions outside the conference room. All the four Governmentsrecognised that it presented a greater immediate threat to world peace than the situation in Europe. It was evident, from the conversations which had taken place, that President Eisenhowerrecognised the heavy responsibility that rested on him, and that hewas resolved to do his utmost to restrain Chiang Kai-shek from anyrash or provocative course of action. The efforts which he had sofar made to persuade Chiang to withdraw his forces from the coastalislands had not been successful. He was now considering thepossibility that Chiang might be induced to reduce his forces there,so thai they might present less of a challenge to the communists and, from his point of view, be less of a hostage to fortune. If the islands were held only as outposts, it would be less likely that a majorstruggle would develop there in which the United States might feel obliged to intervene.. On the other side it was also evident, frointhe conversations at Geneva, that the Russians would use sugIiinfluence as they had over the Chinese Communists to dissuade them from taking any action which might precipitate a1 major conflict inthe Far East.In the Conference itself discussion had turned mainly on thequestions of German unification and European security. It had proved impossible to induce the Russians to modify their view thatGermany could not be unified until a new system of security hadbeen established in Europe. In this they were influenced by a genuinefear that Germany might re-emerge as a strong military power inEurope. Even if the Russian leaders could be persuaded that this could be prevented, their freedom to manoeuvre would for some time be limited by an instinctive fear of Germany among the Russianpeople. This evidently went so deep that even a dictatorship hadto take account of it. At this Conference, at any rate, the russians had seemed to be more apprehensive of the resurgence of Germanythan of encirclement by the United States.The other outstanding impression left by the Conference was thedesire of the Russian leaders to establish more normal relations with governments of the West. They seemed genuinely anxious to secure a relaxation of international tension and a friendlier relationship withthe Western Powers.The Foreign Secretary said that he was in full agreement withall that the Prime Minister had said and had little to add to if. TheRussians had seemed far less anxious than he had expected aboutthe possibility of encirclement by the United States. They were much more concerned about Germany and, in the long run perhaps,at the position in which they might find themselves between aresurgent Germany and a strong China. He doubted whether theForeign Ministers, at their meeting in October, would make much progress towards the unification of Germany. But, if a steadypressure were maintained, a solution might eventually be foundthrough some form of security pact for Europe. Meanwhile it certainly seemed that the Russian leaders were anxious to followpeaceful policies in Europe. They had presumably, concluded that,with the advent of nuclear weapons, European war would not servetheir purposes. Moreover, with the end of the Stalin regime, theyseemed less disposed to favour aggressive methods and would prefer,if they could, to devote their Vesources to the development of their internal economy. -.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
Singapore.(previous references:C.C. (54) 29lhConclusions.Minute 7 and cm. (55) 25thConclusions,Minute 8.)5. The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs said that theLegislative Assembly of Singapore had on the previous day passed a resolution asking (i) that the Governor, in the exercise of his powers, should place the most liberal possible interpretation on theterms of the existing constitution; (ii) that, where the Governor was required by the constitution to consult with Ministers, he should accept their advice; and (iii) that the time had come for the grant ofa new constitution providing for the immediate grant of self- govern-ment. The Governor had said that he must have time to consider this resolution, and could not give an immediate reply to it.The new constitution had been in force for little more than threemonths: there could be no question of amending it without full discussion: the Governor would doubtless do his best to avoidmaking any further statement until he had had an opportunity for personal consultation with the Colonial Secretary, who would be in singapore for a short time on 31st July and would be returning,about ten days later, for a longer stay. Meanwhile the Commissioner-General for South-East Asia had arrived in Singapore and would doubtless bring his influence to bear on the Chief Minister. Britishtroops were available to deal with any disorders that might arise. in singapore one infantry battalion and a squadron of armoured carswere available, and there was another infantry battalion in Johore.There was every reason to believe that the police would be reliable.The Prime Minister said that he saw no reason to consider theamendment of a constitution which had been in force for little morethan three months. The Commissioner-General for South-east asia would presumably send an early appreciation of the situation.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Security inthe Colonies.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 73rdConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the LordChancellor (CP. (55) 89) covering an interim report of the Committeeon Security in the Colonies.The Lord Chancellor recalled that on 5th November, 1954, theCabinet had appointed a Committee of Ministers to review theexisting organisation of armed forces, police and security services in colonial territories. This Committee had invited General Sir GeraldTempler to carry out an investigation on their behalf. GeneralTempler&apos;s report was annexed to his memorandum.The military aspects of General Templer&apos;s report were still under consideration. This interim report dealt only with his recommendations on Police and Security Services. The mostimportant of these were:  (i) that separate Police and Intelligence Departments should beestablished within the Colonial Office;(ii) that the Colonial Secretary should join with the foreign secretary and the Minister of Defence in issuing a new charter of theJoint Intelligence Committee;(iii) that the Colonial Office should be permanently represented on the Joint Intelligence Committee and Joint Intelligence Staff; and(iv) that the United Kingdom should, if necessary, contribute towards the cost of establishing regional police training colleges inthe Colonies.The Committee strongly endorsed these recommendations, which had now been accepted by the Colonial Office. Other less importantrecommendations in General Templer&apos;s report had also beenaccepted and were being out into operation.

There was, however, one recommendation which neither tneColonial Secretary nor the Committee felt able to accept-namely that, in appropriate cases, there should be no hesitation in operatinga &quot; colour bar in reverse &quot; to ensure rapid promotion of Africans in colonial Police Forces. The Colonial Secretary feared that theadoption of this recommendation would undermine the morale ofEuropean police officers now serving in Colonial territories in Africa.The Committee had felt obliged to accept his view on this point,though they hoped that no opportunity would be lost of promotingsenior African police officers, wherever possible.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs said that, in thelight of Foreign Office experience, the Colonial Office were now prepared to accept the recommendations for the establishment of separate Police and Intelligence Departments within the ColonialOffice and for the closer association of the Colonial Office with Hiework of the Joint Intelligence Committee and Joint IntelligenceStaff.(b) The Commonwealth Secretary suggested that -the time had come when his Department should also be permanently represented on the Joint Intelligence Committee.The Prime Minister said that he would like to have anopportunity of considering this suggestion, in the light of advice fromthe Chiefs of Staff and the Chairman of the Joint IntelligenceCommittee.(c) In the later stages of their development towards self-govern-ment the Colonies enjoyed a considerable measure of independence in the allocation of their revenue, and it would not always be easy to ensure that in these territories expenditure on such purposes asthe provision of houses for the police had a sufficiently high priority in comparison with expenditure on social services.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations in the interim report of theCommittee on Security in the Colonies, and invited theColonial Secretary to take immediate steps to bring them into operation.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider thesuggestion that the Commonwealth Relations office should be permanently represented on the joint intelligence Committee.(3) Agreed that the Committee on Security in the colonies should remain in being and should report to the Cabinet(i) on the military aspects of General Templets report and(ii) on the progress made in giving effect to the approvedrecommendations on Police and Security Services in colonial territories.7. The Cabinet resumed their discussion on the questionwhether the United Kingdom should vote in favour of admittingJapan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.).The Cabinet were informed that it now seemed likely that japan would in any event obtain rather more than the minimum numberof votes necessary for admission to the G.A.T.T. Of the moreimportant industrial countries, Germany&apos;s attitude was not yet known, but it was understood that the Benelux countries intended to vote in favour of Japan&apos;s admission. On the other hand, an increasing number of those countries which intended to vote in herfavour were expected to avail themselves of the protection afforded
AdministrativeTribnnals:(previous reference:CM. (55) 19thConclusions.Minute 7.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (55) 88) on the composition and terms of reference of the proposed Committee to enquire into the working of administrative tribunals.The Laid Chancellor said that the proposals outlined in his memorandum were based On further consultations which had beenheld since the Cabinet previously discussed this matter on 30lh June.Discussions had taken place between senior officials of the Depart-meuts concerned; and he had also had an opportunity of consultingwith some of his colleagues before formulating his proposals.Discussion showed that there was general agreement with theternis of reference proposed in paragraph 3 of the Lord Chancellorsmemorandu m.As regards the composition of the Committee, the followingpoints were raised:  (a) Since the Lord Chancellors memorandum was written,Lord RadclilVe had been appointed a trustee of the will of the late mr.. Gulbenkian. This might make it impossible for him to acceptthe Chairmanship of the proposed Committee. The Lord chancellor would consult him about this.(b) Sir Oliver Franks might be asked to act as Chairman of theCommittee if Lord Radclilfe were unable to do so. In that eventLord Justice Parker might be asked to serve as a member of theCommittee.by Article XXXV. Of the Commonwealth countries, Australia,South Africa and the Central African Federation were inclined to abstain, but Australia had asked what our intentions were.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Although we should invoke the safeguards afforded by article XXXV, these would be effective only against japanese competition in the home market and not against competition in export markets overseas.(/;) A decision to vote in favour of admitting Japan would not be popular in this country, especially in Lancashire. But it would tendto secure the advantage of Japanese goodwill, and neither abstentionnor a hostile vote could now impede her admission.(c) It would be possible for the United Kingdom to delay theirvote until it was clear that Japan had already obtained the numberof votes needed for admission.The general feeling of the Cabinet was that, in these circum-stances, the best course would be to vote for Japans admission. TheGovernment would be open to political criticism if they recordeda favourable vote immediately after Parliament had adjourned; andour vote should be delayed on that account until about 8th August.Jn the interval the.other Commonwealth Governments should beinformed of the course which we proposed to follow; and it wouldbe helpful if some of them could be persuaded to follow the same line.The Cabinet (I) Agreed that the vote of the United Kingdom should be recorded, about 8th August, in favour of the entry of japan into the G.A.T.T.; and authorised the Presidentof the Board of Trade to make arrangements accordingly.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to inform other commonwealth Governments of this decision, and to do what he could to influence them to follow the same course.
; (c) If the Trades Union Congress were invited to nominate a-member-of the Committee, the British Employers&apos; Confederationmight feel that they should have had - a similar opportunity to nominate an employer. There was something to be said for including a suitable industrialist among the members of the Committee. Itwould, however, be preferable that both the trades unionist and theindustrialist should be selected by the Government, though the TradesUnion Congress and the British Employers&apos; Confederation shouldhave an opportunity to comment on the Governments choice before any public announcement was made.The Cabinet (1) Approved the terms of reference, proposed in paragraph 3of CP. (55) 88, for the Committee which was to enquire into the working of administrative tribunals.(2) Approved the membership of the proposed Committee, asset out in paragraph 4 of CP. (55) 88, subject to the points, noted in paragraphs (a) to (c) above.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor to ascertain whether LordRadclifle would be able to accept the Chairmanship ofthis Committee; to consult with the Minister of Labourand the President of the Board of Trade on the choice.ofa trades unionist and an industrialist to serve as membersof the Committee; and to submit for the Prime ministers approval his final recommendations regarding the.     composition of the Committee.traffic        9.   The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of on.     Transport (CP. (55) 91) and the Minister of Works (CP. (55) 96)]e      on a scheme for relieving traffic congestion at Hyde Park Cornerby constructing a new roundabout and tunnel and by convertingPark Lane and the East Carriage Drive into one-way streets.The Minister of Transport said that urgent action was needed to relieve the traffic congestion at Hyde Park Corner. elements in the present scheme had been under consideration for a number ofyears and, although there had been important differences of opinionon the question whether a tunnel was necessary, those differenceshad now been resolved. The scheme now planned would have theeffect, not merely of relieving local traffic congestion in the hyde park area, but of improving the access to inner London from thewest. He recognised that the scheme, which would involve radicalreconstruction at Hyde Park Corner, would affect the amenities inthat area. But the problem had been exhaustively considered andthe traffic problem was now so urgent that time should not be lost in canvassing the possibility of an entirely new alternative proposal.The Minister of Works said that the Fine Arts Commission hadcommented adversely on this scheme, and it would certainly provokemuch public controversy. He doubted whether the scheme would achieve as much as had been claimed for it: much of the traffic congestion might merely be transferred to the Piccadilly area. the traffic problem at Hyde Park Corner might be more effectivelyrelieved by more radical road&apos;improvements elsewhere, e.g., nearVictoria Station. The proposal to include a tunnel had been addedat a late stage to a surface scheme which was already intended as a comprehensive scheme. He wondered therefore whether, with thetunnel as a nucleus, it might not be possible to work out alternativesurface arrangements which would not encroach so much uponV  amenities. , ^
In discussion it was pointed out that some of the amenities thatwould be destroyed could be recreated the trees cut down couldbe planted again but the problem of London traffic was alreadyurgent and would get worse. It would store up trouble to put olfdealing with it. The tunnel by itself would not solve the problem by relieving east-west traffic congestion because the approaches toit would take up space at present available for north-south traffic.It was accepted that, on any basis, a bold approach to the problem would be necessary. But the inclusion of a tunnel at a cost of !  millions would raise the total cost of the scheme to  2^ millions and the Cabinet should be satisfied from all points of view that itwas the best solution that could be achieved.The Lord President said that the Home Affairs Committee hadbeen considering this problem for several months. Nobody likedencroaching on the Royal Parks, but he had been forced, to theconclusion that the traffic problem could not be dealt with otherwise.He was convinced that both an enlarged roundabout and a tunnel would be necessary. The Cabinets discussion had, however,disclosed some differences of opinion on important aspects of theplan; and he thought that a further examination by the two departments concerned, the Road. Research Laboratory and theLondon County Council, in the light of the opinions expressed inthe Cabinefs discussion, might result in some improvements whichmight, help to satisfy public opinion.The Cabinet (I) Agreed in principle that there was need for major roadimprovements to relieve traffic congestion at Hyde ParkCorner, Park Lane and Marble Arch.(2) Recognised that these improvements would involve someencroachment on the amenities of the Royal Parks, butconsidered that, as a tunnel had now been added to theearlier proposals, it might be possible to modify thescheme in such a way as to reduce its interference withamenities.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport to hold discussions forthis purpose with representatives of the Ministry ofWorks, The Ministry of Housing and Local Government,the Road Research Laboratory and the London CountyCouncil, and to report the results of his discussions tothe Cabinet before the end of September.Naiional 10.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theService: Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Minister of LabourScience (CP. (55) 90) proposing that science graduates willing to take upTeachers.        teaching should be allowed to defer their National Service and thata limit should be established for deferment of other scientists.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the shortageof scientists, which was causing general and serious concern, was bound to continue unless effective steps were taken to increase thenumber of teachers of science in the schools. The best means ofsecuring this increase was to allow science graduates to defer their national Service on condition that they took up teaching andremained in that profession. But the number of deferments grantedto scientists for work of other national importance had been increasing greatly in recent years, and if yet another category were now added it might become impossible to claim that (he principleof universality of service was being maintained. A Sub-Committeeof the Home Affairs Committee had, however, been able to agree upon certain proposals.   It was recommended that a limit should be
11 CM. 26 (55)     1^$-established to the total number of deferments granted to scientistsfor all civilian purposes other than leaching, and a system evolvedfor allocating the deferments among the various interests concerned.In addition, all scientists who took up teaching could be deferredon the assumption that the number would not be likely to exceed75-100 each year. If it became apparent that the number of applications was likely much to exceed these figures, there wouldhave to be further consultation between the Education departments and the Ministry of Labour. In order, however, to avoid giving any impression that deferment for this category would be grantedwithout limit, the public announcement which, if approved, wouldbe made in answer to a Parliamentary Question could simply saythat favourable consideration would be given to the deferment ofsuch graduates.The Cabinet Approved the proposals outlined in CP. (55) 90, and authorised the Minister of Labour to make an announce-ment, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, in the terms set out in the annex to that memorandum.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,26th July, 1955.
