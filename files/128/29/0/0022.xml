Nuclear 1.   The Prime Minister drew the Cabinefs attention to the weapons.        statement which had recently been published by a number of(Previous        independent scientists on the dangers of continuing the manufactureReference:      of nuclear weapons.  Lord Russell, who had organised the prepara-C.M. (55) 1st    tion of this declaration, had invited him to give public expressionConclusions,    to his views on the matter.  In his reply to Lord Russell he proposedMinute 4.)       to welcome the fact that it was recognised in this declaration that itDeclaration by was war itself, not merely nuclear weapons, that must be abolishedScientists.        an^ that the renunciation of nuclear weapons must form part of ageneral reduction of armaments; and to point out that this was in fullaccord with the policy which the United Kingdom Government had consistently followed.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the terms of the letter whichthe Prime Minister proposed to send to Lord Russellcommenting on the recent declaration by a number of independent scientists on the dangers of nuclear weapons.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (55) 70) proposing that, if the European payments union gave place to a European Fund, the privileges and immunitiespreviousy accorded to the former should be extended to the latter andalso to any Multilateral Compensation Agency which might beestablished in connection with it. These immunities would apply tothe organisations themselves, not to individuals employed by them.In discussion it was recognised that the international agreementsestablishing the European Fund and any Multilateral CompensationAgency should include provisions defining the privileges and immunities to be accorded to these organisations. It was, however,suggested that no action need be taken to confer these privileges and immunities in the United Kingdom if, as seemed likely, neitherorganisation wished to establish any branch or agency in this country.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to support the inclusion, inthe Agreements establishing the European Fund and anyMultilateral Compensation Agency, of provisions designedto confer on these organisations privileges and immunitiessimilar to those extended to the European payments union.(2) Agreed that, if in due course either of these organisationsproposed to establish agencies in the United Kingdom,steps should be taken by Order in Council to secure for those agencies the privileges and immunities prescribed in the Agreement.Privileges and immunities.(previous reference:CM. (55) 14thConclusions,Minute 6.)The EuropeanFund.EconomicSituation.(previous reference:CC. (55) 19thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet had before them (i) a note by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (55) 68) covering a report by officials on thebalance of payments prospects and (ii) a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (55) 65) commenting on theeconomic situation and indicating some of the measures which hewas disposed to take to remedy it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in itself, the deterioration in the balance of payments was not critical. It was largely due to a continuing increase in the demand for imports arisingfrom the growth of national prosperity. The trade returns for Juneshowed a marked increase in the excess of imports over exports.48545-1b 2
To ensure a satisfactory level of exports it was essential that manu-facturing costs should remain competitive, and there was need for agreater measure of control over the total level of demand in orderto prevent the development of inflation. The prospects were thatwe should achieve barely a balance in our overseas accounts. Thatwas not enough, since the deterioration in the overseas balance had come about at a time when world conditions were favourable, andwe needed to earn a substantial surplus if we were to meet all our commitments and responsibilities.Although the loss to the reserves in the coming months was not likely to be very large, there was a danger that confidence in sterling and in the strength of the national economy might be adversely affected. The Government must therefore make it clear that theywere determined to handle the economic situation firmly.The measures which had already been taken to restrict creditwere beginning to have some effect. The Clearing Banks were readyto co-operate fully in implementing this policy, but they were anxious that the Government should give some public indication of their support of the action which the Banks were taking and that theyshould also show that they were prepared to restrain expenditurein the public sector.It would be possible to supplement the existing credit restrictionsby tightening hire-purchase facilities, e.g., on motor-cars. This coursewould be preferable to an increase in the purchase tax.The policy of credit restrictions, even with some further measures of this kind, might not prove adequate to restrain the inflationary pressure. In that event it would be necessary to consider some direct attack on consumer expenditure. The recent increasein coal prices would help in this direction, but other similar measures,e.g., the removal of the bread subsidy, might also be needed.The following were the main points raised in the cabinets discussion:  (a) It was generally agreed that, if unpopular measures were needed, they should be taken soon. Of the measures which had beensuggested for reducing demand some were clearly more controversialthan others. Such measures as restricting facilities for hire purchasemight be taken first, while others (e.g., increasing the price of bread)might be deferred for consideration later.(b) The Government should be able to demonstrate that anyfurther measures introduced to correct the balance of payments were necessary in order to help exports. There was no doubt that,although the rate of exports had been increasing, it was not as high as it should be, because of the pull of the home market.(c) Expenditure in the public sector should not be exempt fromthe policy of credit restriction. Substantial expenditure by the nationalised industries had been made possible by Bank advanceswhich the nationalised industries were in some cases now attempting to pay off by market issues.(d) It was argued that the Government^ efforts should be concentrated on measures to reduce consumption rather thaninvestment. Restrictions which affected investment were bound to dosome harm to export industries, and would delay the industrialre-equipment needed to restore the competitive strength of the economy. In this connection, it was pointed out that the investment programmes for the modernisation of roads and railways were still intheir earliest stages; to modify those programmes now would not result in any appreciable saving of expenditure and would seriously prejudice development which would be remunerative in the future.(e) The Cabinet were reminded that they were to consider thefuture level of housing subsidies at their next meeting.(/) The abolition of the bread subsidy would add 2\d. to the costof the l\d. loaf and would represent an addition of Is. Sd. per week to the average household budget. It would, hov/ever, save  40 million in the current year. It was suggested that this change could best bemade in a Budget, when it. could be accompanied by compensating
5 CM. 22 (55)reliefs, or at a time when other measures were being taken to reducedemand. It might, at the same time, be possible to adjust the milksubsidy so as to encourage increased consumption of liquid milk.(g) A direct attack on consumer expenditure, e.g., by an increasein the price of bread, would increase the pressure for higher wages.There would be an increase (which it was hoped would be temporary)of two points in the Interim Index in the current month, and a further increase later on account of the increases in coal prices. Other price increases would make it even more difficult for employers to resist the wage claims which would follow the autumn conferences of theTrades Unions.(h) Another factor which made it difficult to restrain the pressure for higher wages, and to persuade the public that measures to restrictconsumer expenditure were justified, was the continuing boom on theStock Exchange. There were many causes for this boom, includingthe fact that most companies held good reserves because of the long period of dividend restraint. Investors generally were beginning torealise, with a continual fall in the value of money, that equities were a better investment than fixed-interest stocks.(/) Among other means of reducing expenditure on consumption,consideration should be given to the possibility of giving furtherencouragement to small savings. Could savings loans be made more attractive to the small saver? Means might be found of enablinginvestors in. savings loans to share the benefits available to those whowere investing directly in equities.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the light of the cabinet&apos;s discussion he would proceed as follows. As regardsexpenditure in the public sector, he would discuss with the ministers concerned the possibility of restraining expenditure by the nationalised industries, and would arrange for the Treasury, withthe Departments concerned, to examine the whole field of Govern-ment expenditure, at home and overseas. In consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade, he would consider what further restrictions of hire-purchase facilities could be brought into operation at an early date. He would consider the question of the bread subsidywith the Minister of Food. He would report to the Prime minister whether there was any practicable means of curbing the stock exchange boom. He would also consider what statement he might make to indicate the Governments support for the policy of restricting credit and restraining expenditure.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make a further report on the economic situation in the light of the consul-tations which he had proposed to hold.Fog.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 8thConclusions,Minute 10.)4. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of housing and Local Government (CP. (55) 66) and the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (55) 71) on a point of policy which had arisen in the preparation of the Clean Air Bill.The Minister of Housing said that, as drafted, the Bill wouldenable a local authority to prescribe, by an Order subject to theMinister&apos;s approval, a &quot; Smoke Control Area &quot; in which the emissionof smoke would be an offence. The question now at issue was whether the provisions of the Bill should extend to smoke fromdomestic chimneys and, if so, to what extent house-owners shouldbe required to defray the cost of adapting fireplaces for burningsmokeless fuel. The Bill at present provided that half of this cost should be met from public funds 37-J per cent, by the Exchequerand 12^ per cent, by the local authority and that, in addition, localauthorities should have discretion to pay, without Government grant,
all or part of the remaining 50 per cent. He had been invited by theHome Affairs Committee to submit for the Cabinets considerationtwo alternative proposals for reducing the financial burden which thiswould impose on owners of house property. The first of these wasthat the Bill should not apply to existing houses, and should do no more than require that new houses should be equipped with fire-places suitable for burning smokeless fuel. The alternative wasthat 75 per cent, of approved expenditure on the adaptation of domestic fireplaces should be met from public funds 50 per cent, bythe Exchequer and 25 per cent, by the local authority.The Minister said that he could not recommend the first of these courses. The Government had undertaken to introduce legislation to implement the recommendations of the Beaver Committee; andthe measures for dealing with domestic smoke were an essential partof those recommendations. The Committee had found that nearly half of all the smoke in the air came from domestic chimneys, and theGovernment would not be justified in requiring industry to take costlysteps to control smoke from factory chimneys if they proposed totake no action in respect of smoke from existing houses. Organisedindustry would withdraw their support for the clean air policy if itceased to apply to domestic, as well as industrial, smoke. If therefore the provisions of the Bill were to be altered, he must advise theCabinet to adopt the second of the two courses set out in paragraph of CP. (55) 66.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had reviewed thismatter further since his memorandum was circulated, and he was now prepared to consider a compromise by which the cost of adaptingfireplaces in existing houses would be divided equally between theGovernment, the local authority and the householder.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The cost of adapting domestic fireplaces was likely to be substantially larger than the estimate ( 10) given in the report of theBeaver Committee. Moreover, the cost would be highest in respectof the oldest classes of property, which were the least remunerativeto the owner.(b) It was important that the contribution which the localauthority would make towards this cost should be not less than thatto be made by the property-owner.(c) While a solution could probably be found on the general principle that the Exchequer, the local authority and the owner eachpaid one-third of the cost, it was undesirable that the exchequer contribution should be reduced below 37^ per cent., since this figure had already been mentioned in discussions with local authority associations.The Cabinet Agreed that the financial provisions of the Clean Air Billshould be drawn on the principle that the cost of adaptingfireplaces in existing houses so as to comply with theprovisions of the Bill should be borne in roughly equalshares by the Exchequer, the local authority and the owner of the property; and invited the Chancellor of the exchequer to settle, in consultation with the Minister of Housing andLocal Government, detailed provisions designed to giveeffect to that principle.Cyprus. 5.   The Colonial Secretary said that during his visit to Cyprus(Previous he had satisfied himself, by personal discussion with the Governor,Reference: that special powers were needed to break up the terrorist organisationCM. (55) 2lst which was threatening to disrupt the administration by acts of conclusions, violence. The Governments initiative in convening a conference with minute 1.) representatives of the Greek and Turkish Governments should, in
his view, be supplemented by firmness in maintaining law and orderin the island. There was ample evidence of a conspiracy to fomentdisorder by acts of violence, and the Governor could best defeat thisby taking power to arrest and detain those responsible for organisingit. The law which the Governor proposed to enact for this purpose would be limited, in its application, to persons who had been active in the furtherance of an association which had been responsible for organising acts of violence directed against the administration ofthe Island.The Lord Chancellor observed that, from the discussions whichhad recently been held on the general question of security in colonial territories, it appeared that the Governor of Cyprus had not hithertoaccorded a high priority to security and intelligence measures. It wasto be hoped that he would now revise his earlier judgment on theimportance of these measures.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to arrange for theGovernor of Cyprus to introduce, as a temporary measure, a special law enabling him to arrest and detainpersons believed to have been active in the furtherance of associations responsible for organising acts of violencein the Island.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to authorise Her Majesty&apos;ammbassadors in Athens and Ankara to inform the greek and Turkish Governments (at their discretion and not before the law had been promulgated in Cyprus) of this action and of the reasons for it.Monopolies andRestrictivePractices.(previous reference:CM. (55) 21stConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (CP. (55) 69) on the line to be taken byGoverment spokesmen in the forthcoming debate in the House ofCommons on the report of the Monopolies Commission on collectiveboycott and exclusive dealing.The President of the Board of Trade said that, as requested bythe Cabinet on 7th July, he had discussed this question with theCabinet Committee which had been appointed to consider this reportby the Monopolies Commission. The Committee had accepted his proposal that the Government spokesmen in the forthcoming debate should steer a middle course between the majority and minorityreports of the Commission on the lines indicated in paragraph 4 of cp. (55) 69. Subject to the Cabinefs views, he proposed that heshould open the debate on those lines. The Attorney-General would reply to the debate.In discussion there was general support for the recommendationsput forward in CP. (55) 69.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the terms of the motion, as setout in the Annex to CP. (55) 69, to be moved on behalfof the Government in the debate in the House ofCommons on 13 th July.(2) Agreed that Government spokesmen in the debate should speak on the lines proposed by the President of the Boardof Trade in CP. (55) 69.
legislative programme:1955-56Session.(previous reference:CM. (55) 18thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (CP. (55) 63) on the progress made with the preparationof Bills included in the legislative programme for the current session.The Lord Privy Seal said that some of the Bills which were tohave been introduced before the summer recess could not now beready for introduction before the adjournment. It was, however,important that as many as possible of these Bills should be introduced before the House rose, even though they could make no progressbefore the recess, so that Parliament might be able to proceed withthem immediately after it reassembled in the autumn.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Family Allowances Bill might now be ready for introduction before the end of July.(b) It should be possible to complete the preparation of the CleanAir Bill in time for it to be presented before the recess.(c) Every effort should be made to present the Bill on Health,Welfare and Safety in Agriculture and Forestry before the recess, sothat its Second Reading might be taken early in the autumn.(d) It now seemed likely that a Pensions Increase Bill would berequired in the autumn.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the report by the Lord Privy Seal (CP. (55) 63)on the state of the legisative programme.(2) Invited the Ministers concerned to continue their efforts toensure that the Family Allowances Bill and all the Billsnoted in the Appendix to CP. (55) 63 (with the exceptionof the Channel Islands (National Service) Bill, theInventions and Designs (Defence) Bill, and the Water Bill)were introduced before Parliament rose for the summer recess.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th July, 1955.
