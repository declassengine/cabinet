Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed that on 28th April a motionwould be put forward by the Opposition in the House of Commonsproposing that the period of National Service should be made thesubject of a formal enquiry. The first Government speech on this occasion was to be made by the Minister of Defence. The cabinet invited the Prime Minister to reply to the debate. The government spokesmen would take the line that the period of National service was not a suitable subject for enquiry by an independent body andmust remain a matter for Government decision; and that, in viewof the international situation, this was not an opportune moment at which to reduce the period of service.The Cabinet were also informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet considered what should be the length of theLegislative first session of the new Parliament if the present Government wereProgramme :    in office after the General Election.1955-56. It was explained that the time between the opening of the new parliament on 14th June and the beginning of the summer recessmust in any event be occupied mainly with Bills left over from thepresent session. The Government could, however, choose betweenbringing the first session to an end in November, after a briefresumption, or continuing it until July 1956. If the latter course were adopted, The Queen&apos;s Speech on the opening of the new parliament should refer to some of the more important legislative measures whichwere already in preparation or were to be mentioned in the Party&apos;sElection Manifesto.. It was the general view of the Cabinet that the situation would call for a Queen&apos;s Speech of substance, foreshadowing the government&apos;s legislative plans for the coming year. It would alsobe desirable that one or two of the more important Bills for example,the Clean Air Bill and the proposed Bill on safety and welfare inagriculture and forestry should be introduced and, if possible, obtain a Second Reading before Parliament adjourned for the summer recess.The Minister of Agriculture said that he would do his utmost to accelerate the preparation of the proposed Bill on safety and welfarein agriculture and forestry. It would be helpful if it could be statedon behalf of the Government during the Election campaign that legislation on this subject was in preparation and that, if theGovernment were returned, it would be introduced at an early date.The Lord Privy Seal said that early steps should be taken toenable Ministers to decide provisionally what measures would be mentioned in The Queen&apos;s Speech so that the preparation oflegislation could be expedited.48024-2 b 2General 1.   The Prime Minister said that he proposed to waive, for theElection. period of the General Election, the rule which normally precludedMinisterial Ministers from contributing articles to the Press. Ministers would beContributions free during that period to accede to requests by the Conservativeto Press. Central Office that they should contribute signed articles for publication in national and local newspapers.  Ministers should not,however, accept payment for such articles.The Cabinet Approved the Prime Ministers proposal to waive, during theperiod of the Election campaign, the rule precludingMinisters from contributing signed articles for publication in the Press.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, if the Government were in office after theforthcoming Election, the first session of the new parliament should be planned to last until the summer of 1956.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord privy seal to take whatever action was possible to have prepared on this assumption material for The Queen&apos;sSpeech and Bills for introduction in the first session ofthe new Parliament.Formosa. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Secretary(Previous        of JState had now asked whether the United Kingdom government reference:      could make enquiries with a view to testing the sincerity of the offerCM. (55) 5th    which the Chinese Communist Government had made to discuss with conclusions,    the United States Government means of easing the current tensionMinute 7.)       in the Far East. Mr. Dulles had also asked whether he might makeit publicly known that this request had been made.   The foreign secretary said that he proposed to give affirmative answers on bothpoints: it could do no harm to let it be known that our good officeshad been sought.In discussion it was suggested that the Prime Minister of india should be made aware of this approach and kept informed of oursubsequent exchanges with the United States Government on thisquestion.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and invited him to concert with the Commonwealth Secretary meansof keeping the Prime Minister of India informed of subsequent exchanges on this question.Four-Power 5.   The Foreign Secretary said that officials of the GovernmentsTalks. of the United Kingdom, the United States and France were to meet(Previous        on .27th April for preparatory discussions on the form of an invitationReference:       to the Soviet Government to attend a Four-Power Meeting.  It wasCM. (55) 5th    his intention that at this preparatory meeting the United KingdomConclusions,     representatives should at once put forward the proposal that the minute 5.)       Western Powers should suggest to the Soviet Government that anearly meeting of the four Heads of Governments should be held todiscuss all outstanding points of difference between the.Soviet union and the three Western Powers.   It would, however, be stated in the invitation that this procedure would not exclude a continuation ofthe practice of convening the four Foreign Ministers to discuss an-agreed agenda.   This formula should, he thought, avert fruitlessdiscussion on the question whether the proposed meeting should be between Heads of Governments  or Foreign Ministers.    If a preliminary meeting of Foreign Ministers were held it would bepossible to judge, in the light of its progress, whether any useful purpose would be served by proceeding to a meeting of Heads of governments.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign ,&apos;Seeretary.
Industrial 6.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the MinisterDisputes. of Labour (CP. (55) 10) and the Minister of Transport (CP. (55) 11) on railways. the threatened strike by members of the Associated Society of(Previous Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (A.S.L.E.F.).Reference: The Minister of Labour said that, as the settlement to whichCM. (55) 5th A.S.L.E.F. were taking exception had been approved by the RailwayConclusions, Staff National Tribunal and accepted by the National Union of minute 4.) Railwaymen (N.U.R.), he would not be justified in setting up anindependent court of inquiry or pressing the British transport commission to modify their attitude. The Trades Union Congress(T.U.C.) were, however, seriously concerned at the situation and had arranged to see representatives of both railway unions that day. TheMinister said that he ought to make a further statement in the Houseof Commons not later than the following day and, if the threat of astrike continued, a further appeal should perhaps be addressed toA.S.L.E.F., possibly by the Prime Minister.The following were the main points covered in discussion:  (a) The Cabinet were informed that arrangements to maintain essential supplies and services in the event of a strike were underreview by the Emergencies Committee. Preparations were in hand to proclaim a state of emergency, if necessary, if the strike shouldoccur and thereafter to issue emergency regulations. It would benecessary to decide not later than 28th April whether the Post office should be provided with the 500 troops which would be needed fromthe outset of a strike to maintain long-distance carriage of mails, andwhether the Transport Commission should be authorised to refuseto undertake the carriage of livestock by rail from 29th April.It was the provisional view of the Cabinet that no objection need be raised to the taking of such precautionary measures provided thatthey were not of a kind which would induce the N.U.R. to modify their present intention to keep their members at work.(b) Support was expressed for the view that, although thedecision of A.S.L.E.F. to resort to strike action was indefensible, itwould be particularly regrettable if the long-threatened railwaystoppage were to take the form of a strike by members of A.S.L.E.F.over a question of differentials. It was suggested that, if the T.U.C.were to succeed in persuading A.S.L.E.F. and the N.U.R. to take part in further talks about differentials on the basis that the strikenotices issued by A.S.L.E.F. were withdrawn, the Government wouldbe justified in urging the Transport Commission to play their partin any resulting discussions.The Cabinet were informed that the Chairman of the transport commission had already made it clear that, provided the strike was called off, the Commission would be ready to hold further discussions on the subject of differentials provided this was without prejudice totheir position in the matter. On the other hand, the N.U.R. seemed unlikely to be willing to enter into such further discussions, at leastunless it were made clear that there would be no interference withthe recent wages settlement and that the Commission would be willingto make additional funds available to provide for any further wagechanges which might be agreed upon. Alternatively, discussionsmight be directed to the railway wages structure and to the principles on which differentials should be based, any agreed changes in thesebeing left to be introduced as part of any future wages settlement.It was the general view of the Cabinet that in the circumstances the T.U.C. should be given every encouragement in any further efforts which they might desire to make to break the present deadlock.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour andof the points made in discussion.
(2) Agreed to resume, at their meeting on the following day,consideration of the arrangements to maintain essential supplies and services in the event of a strike.Ministry of 7.   The Minister of Agriculture invited the Cabinet to decideAgriculture, whether the redistribution of the functions of the former Ministry of fisheries and Food should be completed before Parliament was dissolved on food. 6th May.  A further Order was required to transfer to the Minister(Previous        of Health responsibility for food cleanliness and hygiene in EnglandReference:      and Wales. If this Order were made and laid before Parliament beforeC.C. (55) 18th   the dissolution, it would come into force at once but would remainConclusions,    subject to annulment by either House of Parliament during a periodMinute 5.)       of forty sitting days in the first session of the new Parliament.   Itwould be convenient to the Departments concerned to follow thiscourse, but the Opposition might take the view that the making ofthe Order should have been deferred until a date when early steps could be taken to debate it in Parliament on a prayer for itsannulment.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to defer until after the forthcoming Election the making of theproposed Order transferring to the Minister of Health theresponsibility for food cleanliness and hygiene in Englandand Wales.Common Land.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 106thConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture (CP. (55) 4) proposing that a formal enquiry should beheld, by a Royal Commission or a Departmental Committee, into thelaw of commons.In discussion there was general agreement that the time was ripe for an independent enquiry into this question. It was, however, theview of the Cabinet that a decision to hold such an enquiry should notbe announced until after a new Parliament had been elected. Theannouncement might appropriately be made in The Queen&apos;s speech on the opening of the new Parliament.The Cabinet-(1) Decided that an independent enquiry should be held into thelaw of commons, but agreed that no announcement ofthis decision should be made until after a new parliament had been elected.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to consider, inconsultation with the Prime Minister, the membership and status of the proposed body of enquiry and its termsof reference.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th April, 1955.
