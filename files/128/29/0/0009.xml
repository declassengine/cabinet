The Cabinet were informed that the Governor of Hong KongConference. had not yet completed the enquiries which he had undertaken inLoss of Indian connection with the loss of the Indian airliner which had beenAirliner. carrying part of the Chinese Communist delegation to the Afro-(Previous Asian conference at Bandoeng.

No opportunity should be lost of pressing the PekingConclusions, Government to make available any definite information in their minute 7.)       possession which would assist those who were making enquiries, inIndonesia and in Hong Kong, with a view to ascertaining the causes of the accident. -The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, the Colonial Secretary and theMinister of Civil Aviation, to prepare and submit to thePrime Minister a draft reply to the further message on thismatter which he had received from the Prime Minister ofIndia.Cotton.(previous reference:CM. (55) 7thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the possible meansof easing the current difficulties of the Lancashire cotton industry.The Prime Minister said that earlier that day the Indian finance minister had announced a substantial reduction in the Indian tariffrates on cotton textiles. This would have the effect of reducing thetariff on imports from the United Kingdom by more than a half, toa level of about 30 per cent. The substantial preference which they now enjoyed would also be preserved. No greater concession could have been expected from India. It was now for the Cabinet finallyto decide whether this, together with the reduction of purchase taxwhich had already been announced, would be enough to satisfyopinion in Lancashire.1. The Minister of Labour said that, as a result of further discussions initiated by the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.), theExecutive of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and firemen had agreed on 30th April to withdraw the instructions theyhad issued to their members to strike on 1st May. The terms whichthey had in the end accepted were not different in substance fromthose previously proposed to them by officials of his Department.The settlement was largely due to the pressure exercised by the T.U.C.Although it was not final, there was reason to hope that the threat ofa strike would not be renewed before the Election.The Minister of Labour said that there was still an awkwardsituation on the Mersey side, where the Transport and general works&apos; Union were maintaining their objections to any recognitionof the National Association of Stevedores and Dockers for thepurpose of wage negotiations or of operating the dock labour scheme.The Cabinet were informed that work had been stopped inthirteen pits near Doncaster as a result of a dispute over a new systemof piece-rates. This was an unofficial strike in protest against an experiment which the Coal Board had introduced in the Yorkshirecoalfield with the support of the National Union of Mineworkers.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was evident fromtheir earlier discussions that his colleagues thought it expedient thatsome further concession should be made on purchase tax. he recognised that it was inopportune at the present time to impose a quota on imports of cotton cloth from the Commonwealth, or toraise the general issue of protection against Commonwealth goods.This being so, it might be inevitable that more should be done onpurchase tax. He would himself have preferred to avoid this, partly because it would lead to similar demands from other industries, andpartly because of the administrative difficulties to which it wouldgive rise in the collection of purchase tax which would still be payable on made-up cotton garments. Nevertheless, if his colleagues thoughtit necessary to make some further concession, he was prepared to abolish altogether the purchase tax on non-woollen cloth and domestictextiles. This would cost another  3 millions in a full year.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat this further concession should be made.The Cabinet then considered the draft of an announcement to bemade in the House of Commons that afternoon. Discussion turnedmainly on the terms in which the Government should announce their intention to review the structure of the purchase tax in its effect ontextiles and other high-quality goods which were of special importanceto our export trade. A firm announcement on this point would help to mitigate the disappointment which would be felt in Yorkshire ata concession which brought no benefit to the woollen industry. Onthe other hand the expectation of alterations in the incidence of the tax would be bad for trade if it created an atmosphere of uncertainty and caused buyers to withhold forward orders. The Cabinefsconclusion was that on this point it would be best to say no morethan that the Government proposed to keep under review the structure of the tax in relation to textiles and other high-quality goods which were of importance in the export trade. Other amendments were also approved in the discussion.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, that the Chancellor of theExchequer proposed to abolish altogether the purchase tax on non-woollen cloth and domestic textiles.(2) Approved, subject to the amendments adopted in their discussion, the draft statement on the current difficulties ofthe cotton industry; and invited the.Prime Minister tomake a statement in those terms in the House of commons that afternoon.The Queen&apos;s 4.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of the speech on the Exchequer (CP. (55) 13) covering a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on prorogation of   the Prorogation of Parliament.Parliament. The Cabinet agreed that it was unnecessary to include in the speech a reference to the passing of the Transport (Borrowing Powers)Act, 1955. They approved a number of suggestions for amendmentof the drafting of the Speech.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the drafting amendments adopted inthe discussion, the draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the prorogation of Parliament annexed to (CP. (55) 13).(2) Invited the Prime Minister to submit the amended draft forHer Majesty&apos;s approval.

The Foreign Secretary said that the French and GermanDefence.       \Governments had now reached agreement on the question of the(Previous        future ownership of the Roechling steel works in the Saar.   this reference:      removed the last impediment to French ratification of the ParisCM.

The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the valuation in     Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (55) 14) on the recommendationsScotland.        in the report of the Lord Sorn&apos;s Committee on Rating and Valuationin Scotland.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the main commendation in this report was that the system of owners&apos; ratesin Scotland should be abolished, with consequential changes in rents5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (55) 16) about the reply which Government candidatesshould give during the Election campaign to questions on the increasing immigration into the United Kingdom of coloured workers from colonial territories.The Home Secretary recalled that on 6th December the cabinet had withheld approval of his proposal for a formal enquiry into this problem and had invited him and the Colonial Secretary to arrangefor the preparation of draft legislation designed to place suitablerestrictions on the admission of British subjects from overseas to theUnited Kingdom and on their subsequent stay there. The HomeSecretary said that he still favoured the holding of an enquiry, but he recognised that an announcement to this effect at the present time would be regarded as a delaying device. As he was convinced thatit would be necessary to pass some legislation sooner or later to dealwith this problem, he suggested that he might take an early opportunity during the Election campaign to state publicly that theGovernment, if returned to power, would introduce such legislation.In discussion the view was expressed that the Government wouldbe ill-advised to commit themselves to introducing legislation before they had considered the extent and nature of the powers that wouldbe required. It was the general view of the Cabinet that theGovernment should avoid any definite commitment at this stage. Itshould suffice for members of the Government to say, during theElection campaign, that this might be a suitable subject for some form of public enquiry. Guidance should be given on similar lines to Conservative candidates in the Election.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary and Colonial Secretary to bring before the Election Business Committee a draft note of guidance for Conservative candidates on this subject onthe lines suggested in discussion.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to submit this note, in the formapproved by the Election Business Committee, for thePrime Ministers approval.
and in the basis of valuation for rating. There were sound reasonsfor this proposed change but it would be subjected to heavy criticism on political grounds. The Secretary of State proposed that, if theywere in office after the Election, the Government should announce inThe Queen&apos;s Speech their intention to legislate on this subject, andthat immediately thereafter he should make the fuller statementcontained in the Appendix to CP. (55) 14. Meanwhile he sought authority to instruct his Parliamentary draftsmen to begin thepreparation of the necessary legislation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed in principle with these proposals but must reserve his position on the futuremethod of valuation for rating in Scotland.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that he,too, wished to reserve his position on that question. He attached great importance to the proposed rejection of the recommendationof the Sorn Committee on the subject of Equalisation Grant inScotland.      ,The Cabinet (1) Subject to Conclusion (2) below, approved in principle theproposals in CP. (55) 14 and authorised the Secretaryof State for Scotland to arrange for the preparation of thenecessary legislation.(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for Scotland would hold further discussions with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment on particular points which arose on his proposals.Cyprus. 8.   The Colonial Secretary said that at the instance of the(Previous Opposition there would be a debate on Cyprus in the House ofReference: Commons on 5th May. He sought the advice of his colleagues on. (55) 4th the question whether he should refer in this debate to certain conclusions, inflammatory statements alleged to have been made by Mr. R. H. S.MinuteS.) Grossman, M.P., during a recent visit to Cyprus. These statementshad been reported by a relatively junior official who had been deputedby the Governor to accompany Mr. Crossman on his tour.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be undesirable to mention these alleged statements in the forthcoming debate in theHouse of Commons. If, however, it were contemplated that, inconsequence of them, Mr. Crossman should, in the future, be deniedfacilities for visiting colonial territories and possibly certain foreigncountries, it would be desirable to take early steps to confirm whether he admitted or denied that he had made the statements.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in the forthcoming debate in the House ofCommons on Cyprus, no reference should be made toinflammatory statements alleged to have been made byMr. R. H. S. Crossman, M.P., during a recent visit to cyprus.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to consider whether stepsought not to be taken to ascertain whether Mr. Crossmanadmitted or denied that he had made the allegedstatements.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd May, 1955.
