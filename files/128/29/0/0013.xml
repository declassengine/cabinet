industrial disputes.(previous reference:CM. (55) 12thConclusions,Minute 3.)Railways.1. The Minister of Labour said that during the past week-end the British Transport Commission had published proposals whichthey had put before the Associated Society of Locomotive engineers and Firemen (A.S.L.E.F.) as a basis on which negotiations might be resumed if the strike were called off. The Transport Commissionaccepted the principle that there should be higher rewards for specialskill and responsibility, where these were not already given, and agreed that there was a case for such higher rewards for certain sections of the footplate staff. They also agreed not to press their previous proposals for special allowances for driving middle-distanceand long-distance trains, which the Union rejected on the ground thatit involved a classification of drivers. The Transport commission were prepared to modify their former proposals for an extension ofmileage payments and to examine basic wages in the driver grade.At the same time they asked for an undertaking that subsequentsettlements for other grades would not be held to justify any further increase for the footplate staff. These proposals fell short of therequirements of A.S.L.E.F. in at least three respects. They includedno immediate cash offer before a return to work; they held out no prospect of any increase in the basic rate of firemen, who would,however, gain some benefit from the proposed extension of mileagepayments; and they were open to the objection, from A.S.L.E.F.&apos;spoint of view, that the inclusion of the National Union of Railwaymen(N.U.R.) in any subsequent negotiations might lead to further delay in the conclusion of a final settlement.The Minister said that A.S.L.E.F. might be more ready to agreeto the Commission^ proposals if the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.)would bring their influence to bear on the Union in favour of a returnto work on the basis proposed. Unfortunately, however, both theT.U.C. and the Labour Party now seemed to be encouragingA.S.L.E.F. to maintain their attitude and were disposed to challengethe view that detailed negotiations on the actual amounts of possibleincreases in rates of wages and allowances could not be resumed solong as the strike continued.The Minister said that he had not felt that it would be right toput pressure on the Chairman of the Transport Commission in favoureither of resisting the claims of A.S.L.E.F. or of further concessions.So far, the only conciliatory move made by A.S.L.E.F. had been to confirm their agreement that the cleaners could be excluded from anypay improvements which might be arrived at, whereas the transport commission had revised their proposals more than once in an attemptto meet the Union&apos;s views. The Minister said that, in his view, theChairman of the Commission should be left to decide what further move he could now make, not excluding the promise of some immediate token payment, which would almost certainly bring abouta resumption of work. At present, however, although the total sum ofthe money would be relatively small, the Chairman considered thatany immediate cash offer would involve a surrender of principle.In discussion the view was expressed, on the one hand, that sometoken cash offer would almost certainly have to be made sooner or later in order to enable the Executive of A.S.L.E.F. to instruct theUnion&apos;s members to resume work and that, if this was so, itwas preferable that the offer should be made sooner rather than later.The Transport Commission would have sound commercial grounds for making some financial concession as a means of avoiding the losses which they would incur both immediately and in the longer term as a result of the continuance of the strike.Other Ministers, however, supported the view that the transport commission could not afford to overlook the fact that this was the fifth time in two years that they had been confronted by threats of strike action and that if, as on previous occasions, they made sub-stantial concessions for the purpose of maintaining their services, theymust expect that threats of strike action would continue to be madein the period ahead.
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster suggested thatA.S.L.E.F.&apos;s insistence on a firm cash offer might possibly be met ifthe Transport Commission were to give an undertaking that nego-tiations, if they were resumed, would be on the basis that a definiteglobal sum of nrOney would be available for distribution in whatevermanner might be agreed upon in negotiations. Such an undertakingwould involve no fresh concession by the Commission, for their proposals had from the outset assumed that a certain additional sumof money would be forthcoming. The Cabinet agreed that thissuggestion merited consideration, although it was far from certain thatit would satisfy A.S.L.E.F. It might, nevertheless, be combined withthe suggestion, which Sir Brian Robertson was understood to be readyto consider, that the method of distributing any additional sum ofmoney which might be made available by the Commission should bedecided by an independent body or person. Clearly, however, theTransport Commission could not dissociate themselves altogether from the method of distributing any given sum which they might agreeto make available. They must at least agree in advance, not only thesum to be distributed, but the grades which were to benefit.The following further points were made in discussion:  (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would considerit his duty, when he spoke in the Debate on the Address on 16th June,to emphasise the serious effects of current industrial disputes, andparticularly the present dock strike, on the future prospects of thenational economy. Opportunities for expanding our trade would undoubtedly be lost unless we could compete effectively with our foreign rivals in world markets.It was pointed out that, the more that this aspect of the situation was stressed by Government spokesmen, the more would theGovernment be pressed to take early and vigorous action to checkindustrial disputes. Equally, if it should prove necessary for some further concession to be made to A.S.L.E.F. to bring about a resumption of work, it would be more than ever necessary to demonstrate that the Government intended&apos; to press forwardresolutely with action to prevent the recurrence of such disputes.(b) If the current discussions with A.S.L.E.F. were to breakdown, it might be desirable for the Prime Minister to intervenepersonally and meet representatives of both the transport commission and the Union.At the conclusion of the discussion the Cabinet were informedthat the discussions with A.S.L.E.F. were still proceeding and were likely to be resumed later that afternoon.The Prime Minister said that in his conduct of these further discussions the Minister of Labour should bear in mind the suggestions which had been made during the Cabinefs discussion.The Cabinet would have an opportunity at their meeting on thefollowing day to consider whether the situation made it desirablethat he should himself intervene in the discussions.The Cabinet -(1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour andof the points made in their discussion.Ocean Liners. The Lord President said that he had received from a directorof the Cunard Steamship Company a disquieting report about the strikes among members of the crews of ocean liners. According tothis report, these strikes were being fomented -by agents of theCommunist Party, and at least one agitator was known to be goingfrom port to port for this purpose. It was also said that intimidationwas being widely practised in order to spread the strike. Althoughthe strikers had not been able to prevent the Queen Elizabeth
from sailing for New York on 9th June, the Cunard Company mightbe unable to arrange for their other liners to sail in accordance withschedule.The Minister of Transport said that, although the situation was serious, some of the strikers had returned to work and two linershad sailed on the previous day. The Cunard Company had been reluctant to take proceedings under the Merchant Shipping Actagainst seamen who had broken their articles; and the numbers involved were now so large that it would hardly be practicable touse this method of restoring discipline. Proceedings for intimidationcould, however, be taken by the police, where sufficient evidence was available; and the Shipping Federation would favour such proceedings in suitable cases.The Cabinet (2) Took note of these statements on strikes by members of the crews of ocean liners.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were reminded that, under the arrangementspreviously made, the House of Commons were to have held that day a general debate on the emergency arising from the current strikes and were to have been asked to pass resolutions continuing in force the Regulations made under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920. TheOpposition had, however, agreed that it would be inexpedient for parliament to debate the merits of the railway strike while discussions were proceeding between representatives of the Transport Commissionand of A.S.L.E.F. It was therefore proposed that at the end of questions that afternoon the Minister of Labour should make a brief statement on the railway strike, at the end of which he would suggest that there should be no debate on its merits while those discussions were proceeding. The House would then be invited topass the resolutions needed to continue the Emergency regulations in force. Thereafter, if time allowed, the Debate on the Addresswould be resumed. A similar procedure would be followed in theHouse of Lords.The Cabinet considered whether a Minister should speak that evening on the Governmenfs behalf in the resumed Debate on the address. They agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power shouldbe ready to intervene in the course of the Debate, and should take that opportunity to enlarge on the Governmenfs programme for\ the development of nuclear energy.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th June, 1955.
