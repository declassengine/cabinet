The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement which the Minister of Labourproposed to make in the House of Commons later that morning.(2) Agreed that, if the Trades Union Congress met with no success in any further efforts which they might make to promoteagreement between the parties to the dispute, the PrimeMinister should see representatives of both parties at an appropriate stage before the strike began.(3) Approved the terms of the announcement to be made, if need arose, explaining the purposes for which Servicemen wereto be employed from the outset of the strike in connectionwith the maintenance of essential postal services.Industrial \    The Cabinet were informed that discussions had been held atDisputes.        the Ministry of Labour on the previous day between representativesRailways.        of the British Transport Commission and of the Associated Society of(Previous        Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (A.S.L.E.F.).   In the course ofReference:      those discussions, which had lasted until late in the evening, officialsCM. (55) 7th    Qf tne Ministry had evolved a formula, which was put to both sides.Conclusions,     The essence of this was that the Transport Commission should minute 1.) &apos;    confirm their acceptance of the Tribunals award and undertake toput it into operation at once; that A.S.L.E.F. should accept thisdecision and instruct their members not to strike on 1st May, andshould proceed to place before the Transport Commission their views and proposals on wage differentials.    The Commission, while accepting no prior commitment and affirming the need for consulta-tion with all parties concerned in the agreements covering footplatestaffs, would undertake to discuss these proposals at once and woulddeclare their intention that the discussions should be concluded at theearliest practicable date.  This formula would have been acceptable to the Transport Commission.   It was, however, rejected by theA.S.L.E.F. representatives, who argued that it offered them no newadvantage, that it gave no undertaking that the proposed discussions would be completed by any specified date and that it involvedparticipation of the National Union of Railwaymen in the discussionof their claims.   They therefore proposed to proceed with their arrangements for calling their members out on strike on 1st May.The Minister of Labour said that there was no further actionwhich he could take at this stage with a view to averting the strike.He proposed to make a statement to that effect when the House ofCommons met later in the morning, and copies of a draft of his proposed statement were handed round at the meeting. In discussionsome verbal changes in the terms of this draft were suggested and approved.In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that the TradesUnion Congress (T.U.C.) were considering whether there was anyfurther initiative which they could take with a view to breaking the deadlock. The Prime Minister suggested that, at the appropriate moment, the Government should themselves make a last appeal to both parties to the dispute, stressing the gravity of the national interests which were at stake. While he was willing that the T.U.C.should make a further effort to bring about agreement, he felt that,if this failed, he should himself see representatives of both parties to\ the dispute before the strike began. Discussion showed that thex Cabinet were in agreement with the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal.The Home Secretary said that preparations were well in hand for maintaining essential services if the threatened strike occurred. Heread to the Cabinet the draft of a statement which would be issued,when need arose, explaining the limited use which was to be madeof Servicemen from the outset of the strike for the purpose ofmaintaining essential postal services.
Railways. 2.   The Minister of Transport said that he would be announcingTransport that day, in a written answer to a Parliamentary Question, theCharges. increases in railway freight rates and dock and canal charges which(Previous        had been recommended by the permanent members of the TransportReference :      Tribunal.   These increases would take effect from 5th June.   the cm. (55) 5th    Transport Commission would also be announcing that day the resultConclusions,     of their application to the Transport Tribunal for leave to makeMinute 3.)       further increases in railway fares.  These increases would also take effect from 5th June. He had arranged for the Transport Commissionto include, in their announcement, a reference to the savings whichwere to be secured by a more efficient deployment of the labour force on the railways.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Transport.War Pensions. 3.   The Minister of Pensions said that there were signs ofParents&apos; widespread dissatisfaction over the adjustments which were beingPensions. made in parents&apos; pensions in consequence of the increase in thestandard rates of old-age pensions. These pensions, which werepayable to parents who had been dependent on sons killed in the war,were assessed individually on the basis of need and had therefore tobe reassessed when the recipients&apos; income was increased, e.g., by anincrease in the standard rates of old-age pensions. It was this processof reassessment which had given rise to the disquiet expressed in theHouse of Commons on the previous day. It was evident that some concession would have to be made, and he had at once given instructions that no further notices of reassessment should be issued.He recommended that, in view of the political pressures, a new basisshould be found for dealing with this problem. Much of the present difficulty could be avoided by raising, by 10.s\, the standard of other means on which liability for these parents&apos; pensions&apos; was assessed. Asimilar increase in the standard had been made in 1952, at a cost ofabout  200,000 a year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that, in view of thepolitical pressures, some concession should be made without delay.He would, however, wish to have a further opportunity to consider theeffect of the particular proposal put forward by the Minister ofPensions.1 $ ..-v        If;  . &apos;; 1...:II        ! &apos; 1 : &apos; iThe Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that some easement should at once bemade in the adjustments of parents&apos; pensions to take account of the increases in the standard rate of old-age pensions.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to settle, inconsultation with the Minister of Pensions, how thiseasement could best be provided.Cabinet Office, S.W.T,29th April, 1955.
