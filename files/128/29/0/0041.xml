3 CM. 41 (55)Parliament ].   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.It was agreed that the Government should not find time forconsideration of the Private Members Bill on capital punishment,which would have to take its place among other Private Members&apos;Bills.The Cabinet were informed that, in view of the way in whichdiscussion of the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill had beenbrought to an end that morning, a procedural motion would benecessary before discussion of the Bill could be resumed. TheCabinet agreed that it would be best to defer the introduction of thenecessary procedural motion until the beginning of the followingweek, even though this might delay further consideration of theHousing Subsidies Bill.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, in order to avoidprotracted debate, especially at the Report Stage, the CommitteeStage of the Housing Subsidies Bill in the House of Commons shouldbe considered in Committee of the whole House. It was realisedthat, if it was not possible to complete the Committee Stage of theFinance Bill after two further days&apos; discussion, this might mean thatthe Committee Stage of the Housing Subsidies Bill might not becompleted before the Christmas recess.2. The Lord Privy Seal said that he now expected the LabourOpposition to press for a full day to be set aside for a debate on therule restricting broadcast discussion of issues about to be debatedin Parliament. They were also likely to persist in their proposal thata Select Committee should be set up to enquire into this question.It was suggested in discussion that the debate might take placeon a motion which simply invited the House to approve the principleof restricting broadcast discussion on issues about to be debatedin Parliament. It would then be possible for Government spokesmento explain in the course of the debate the difficulty of reducing ageneral rule of this kind to detailed regulations covering everycontingency, but to express the Government^ willingness to consider,in consultation with the Opposition leaders, certain modifications ofthe existing practice, e.g., that restrictions on broadcast discussionneed be limited only to the Parliamentary business announced forthe forthcoming week.In further discussion it was agreed that the Government wouldbe better able to influence the course of the debate if it took placeon a motion which they themselves had put down. It was felt,however, that if the terms of the motion were confined to expressingapproval for the principle of limiting broadcast discussion, it wouldbe open to the Opposition to press for some more formal arrangementfor operating the rule and to pursue, in an amendment to the motion,their proposal for a Select Committee. Further consideration shouldtherefore be given to the desirability of making it clear in theproposed motion that the Government were prepared to discussmodifications in the existing rule in accordance with the usualprocedure. Or, alternatively, it might be possible to set out proposalsfor a modified practice in this matter clearly in the terms of themotion.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal, if questioned on the matterduring his forthcoming statement on business, to reply thatthe Government hoped to arrange an early debate on thequestion of the fortnight rule and would put down a motion.49168-1 B 2Broadcasting.The FortnightRule.(PreviousReference :CM. (55) 40thConclusions,Minute 3.)
4Hong KongReductionof Garrison.(PreviousReference :C.C. (54) 29thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofDefence (CP. (55) 174) seeking authority for a gradual reduction inthe garrision of Hong Kong to the level of the forces required forinternal security.The Minister of Defence said that, excluding an auxiliarysquadron of the Royal Hong Kong Defence Force, the garrison ofHong Kong at present consisted of twelve Army units and oneR.A.F. squadron. It was proposed gradually to reduce this garrisonover the next two years to four units and the auxiliary squadron. Thereason for this proposal was that we could not afford to be strongeverywhere, and an examination of our long-term defence programmeand commitments had shown that it was essential to reduce ouroverseas commitments wherever possible. The present situation inthe Far East made it a justifiable risk to put this policy into practiceby making a reduction at Hong Kong. It was proposed to withdrawa field artillery regiment in January and a British battalion in August1956. This would still leave ten units and the R.A.F. squadron inthe garrison at the end of 1956.The Colonial Secretary said that, although he recognised theforce and validity of the arguments set out in CP. (55) 174, hismisgivings about the wisdom of these proposals had not been set atrest. It was not possible to regard the internal and the externalsecurity of Hong Kong, and the garrison forces required for each,as separate questions. Internal security depended, not merely onthe garrison and police forces needed to ensure it, but on the Chineseinhabitants of the Colony, numbering 1\ millions, retainingconfidence that an attack on the Colony would be resisted. If thisconfidence were to diminish there would be a tendency for theChinese inhabitants privily to make terms with Communist Chinaand we should not be able to recover our position. The loyalty ofthe Hong Kong police, a Chinese body, was also based on theirconfidence that we had the forces and the resolution to maintainour position there. The present garrison, while not strong enoughsuccessfully to defend the Colony against determined attack, couldclearly force an aggressor to put up a fight. Moreover, it had beenagreed that even the present garrison was no more than strong enoughto cover in favourable circumstances the evacuation of thedependants of European residents. He did not think that the needfor the garrison was materially less now than it had been in Marchlast, when a decision against reducing it had been taken.If, however, the Cabinet decided that the proposed reductionshould be carried out, he hoped that the programme of withdrawalwould be subject to review at six-monthly intervals and that theGovernor of the Colony would be informed that this was so. Also,the views of the Governor should be sought on the question whetherthe armoured regiment was needed for internal security, and he hopedthat the modern aircraft now in the Colony would not be removed.In discussion the following points were made:   ,(a) The Cabinet were informed that provision had been made inthe estimates for the following year for the-equipment of the R.A.F-squadron in Hong Kong with Venom aircraft. Arrangements werealso being made for two aircraft carriers to visit the Far East in 1956.(b) The border between Hong Kong and China was an easyborder to infiltrate and it would become increasingly difficult for areduced garrison to maintain internal security in face of infiltration.(c) It was pointed out that the garrison could be strengthenedagain if need were to arise and the purpose of creating a strategicreserve of forces was to be able to deal with such contingencies. Thisshould be pointed out to the Governor.
5CM. 41 (55)(d) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the current surveyof the long-term defence programme made it clear that the naval baseat Hong Kong would have to be closed down over a period of aboutthree years. The Colonial Secretary said that he was exercised aboutproposed reductions in naval establishments in many Colonialterritories and arrangements had been put in train for him to discussthis with the First Lord of the Admiralty.The Prime Minister said that it would not have been right tocontemplate reducing the garrison if there had been a prospect oftension in the Far East suddenly increasing. But any aggressivetendencies of Communist China towards Hong Kong would beinhibited not by the strength of the present garrison in Hong Kong butby the knowledge that an attack on the Colony would precipitate war.A further public statement of our determination to maintain ourposition in Hong Kong could, if necessary, be made. The proposedreductions in the garrison would be carried out gradually; they hadbeen arranged in such a way as not to create anxiety; and they wouldbe subject to review.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary and the Minister of Defence toconsult together on the terms of the telegram which, in thelight of the Cabinefs discussion, should be sent to theGovernor of Hong Kong.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the recommenda-tions in paragraph 10 of CP. (55) 174.Korea.(PreviousReference:C.C. (53) 59thConclusions,Minute 5.)UnitedKingdomForces.4. The Prime Minister said that he had been disappointed tolearn that the withdrawal of United Kingdom forces from Korea wasbeing impeded by the weather and that some 5,000 men, who wouldbe useful elsewhere, would now have to remain until the spring.The Cabinet were informed that the withdrawal of these troopswould involve a re-deployment of front-line forces in Korea which itwould be impracticable to carry out in the winter. The Minister ofDefence undertook to look further into this matter.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence to examine further, inconsultation with the Chiefs of Staff, the possibility ofwithdrawing United Kingdom forces from Korea beforenext spring.West Lothian. 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theUnemployment Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (55) 177) about the prospects ofunemployment in West Lothian if the shale oil industry had to closedown.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that this industry wassaid to be running at a loss of  200,000 a year, despite the existingduty preference of Is. 3d. a gallon on home-produced oils. Onesection of the industry would have to close very soon in any case, butit would be possible to absorb elsewhere in the industry or in otheremployment nearby the 600 workers who would be affected.However, unless some further duty concession could be made, thewhole of the shale oil industry in West Lothian would have to closedown; this would affect about 4,000 workers, and it would not bepossible to find other employment for most of them in the area. Theprospect of acute unemployment in this district, which was in aDevelopment Area, was disturbing. The indigenous oil industrywould be of particular value in an emergency, and could bemaintained at a reasonable level of activity if the duty on home-49168-1
6produced oils was further reduced. He felt that the circumstances ofthe shale oil industry were unique, and that a further concession couldbe made without opening the door to other tax remissions.The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor of the Exchequertook the view that a further concession, by way of a reduction in theduty, to this industry, would not be justified on economic grounds, andmight seriously prejudice the revenue. A reduction of 6d. a gallon inthe duty on home-produced oils would cost the Exchequer about 675,000 a year in any case; if this relief had to be extended to all oilsof the same type, it would cost  10 millions a year, and there mightwell be pressure for an equivalent reduction in the petrol tax. TheChancellor of the Exchequer had also pointed out that no concessioncould in any event be made before the next Finance Bill. It would notbe possible to indicate to the industry that such a concession might bemade without anticipating the next Budget.In discussion it was pointed out that the only way of avoiding therisk that the industry might be closed down quickly was by giving anearly indication that some further duty concession might be made. Onthe other hand, the loss which the industry was incurring was not alarge one, in relation to the resources of the controlling concern, theBritish Petroleum Company.The view was expressed by several Ministers that it wasundesirable to give further protection to an industry that could neverhope to be economic. For one thing, the raw material of the industrywas coal, which was likely to go on increasing in price. If the industrywas to close, it was best that this should happen at a time when thegeneral condition of full employment would provide the best chancefor the workers in the industry to obtain other jobs. The Governmentought to do everything possible to help to provide alternativeemployment in the area, but it had to be recognised that there wereother Development Areas in Scotland where there was an even greaterneed to encourage new industry.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to discuss theproblem of the shale oil industry in West Lothian furtherwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the other Ministersconcerned.6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP. (55) 172) covering a report by officials on therecommendations of a working party for additional expenditure in theMiddle East, with a view to safeguarding the free flow of oil suppliesfrom that area. The total cost of the recommendations would beabout  700,000 a year, of which about  200,000 a year would becapital expenditure.The report pointed out that other proposals for an increase inoverseas information expenditure covering the whole world werealready under discussion; the working party&apos;s recommendations for anincrease in overseas information activities in the Middle East wouldmean that the total increase would have to be even greater, unlesssome reduction were made elsewhere in the level of overseasinformation expenditure already proposed. The report also pointedout that the recommended increase in the activities of the BritishCouncil raised the whole question of the future of the Council, sincethe Council stated that an expansion of their work in the Middle Eastwould mean that they would have to close down in other countriesunless they were authorised to offer permanent employment to recruitnew staff.The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor of the Exchequerwas in agreement with the proposals for an increase in technicalassistance and the gift of lorries to Muscat, and with the improvementMiddle-EastOil.(PreviousReference:CM. (55) 35thConclusions,Minute 6.)
7CM. 41 (55)of Foreign Service conditions and facilities on the understanding thattheir detailed implementation would be discussed between theDepartments concerned as the programme proceeded. TheChancellor of the Exchequer had, however, proposed that thesubstantial increase recommended in the information services andthe activities of the British Council, and also the proposedestablishment of a British school for boys in the Lebanon, should beconsidered in the context of a general review of overseas informationexpenditure for the coming year. He had also suggested that furthertime was desirable to consider the long-term future of the BritishCouncil, since proposals for improving the superannuation arrange-ments for Council staff were being examined by the Treasury.The Prime Minister said that he was extremely anxious that theworking party&apos;s recommendations should be put into effect so far aspossible without delay. There seemed no reason to hold up theestablishment of a school in the Lebanon. The proposed increase inour information effort and in the activities of the British Council couldalso be approved, on the understanding that the requirements of theOverseas Departments for additional expenditure on the informationservices elsewhere would have to be reduced, at any rate to someextent, and on the understanding that the long-term future of theBritish Council would have to be considered separately. Heunderstood that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would concur in this.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations of the working party, as setout in CP. (55) 172, on the understanding that therequirements of the Overseas Departments for additionalexpenditure on information services elsewhere than in theMiddle East would have to be reduced, at any rate to someextent, and subject to further discussion about the long-termfuture of the British Council.Teaching of 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theEnglish Minister of Education (CP. (55) 175) recommending that furtherOverseas.       study should be given to ways and means of supporting the teachingof English overseas.The Minister of Education said that it was in our interests toencourage and support the teaching of English in overseas countriesgenerally. French, Dutch and German were ceasing to be employedas second languages and the tide was running in favour of Englishas the second language. Even in India a movement to establishHindi as the common language of the country was failing becausethe language was of little use beyond the stage of secondaryeducation, for all scientific, technical and commercial knowledgewas obtainable only through acquaintance with a European language.The next generation would be a critical period in establishing Englishas the universal instrument of communication. It was in our interestto make some effort to take advantage of this tide but the problemwas not a simple one. To teach English to foreigners requiredspecial training which could be given in this country, if facilities wereavailable, to foreign students; it was also desirable to make serviceoverseas more attractive to British teachers and to providesatisfactorily for their reinstatement here on their return. Theactivities of the various bodies who were or could be concernedwith this problem needed co-ordination in order to achieve a unifiedpolicy.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) It was doubtful whether it would be possible to providefrom this country enough teachers to make an appreciable impact
8upon the problem of teaching English in the world at large. Ourinterest in doing so was not in the same category of importance asour interest in giving people in the Middle East a British type ofeducation.(b) On the other hand, it was argued that these two interestswere not in conflict. Much could be done with a relatively fewteachers from this country established at strategic places andinstrumental in establishing the teaching of English abroad on asound basis. It was greatly to our commercial interest that the useof English in the world should be extended and that facilities shouldbe available for foreign students to come here for training. Britishbusiness interests in India and Pakistan were concerned to maintainthe standing of the English language in that continent.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the question whatmight be done to further our interests in this matter meritedexamination, in the first instance by a committee of officials of theMinistry of Education and the Departments concerned with ouroverseas interests. It would be desirable to bring into consultationat the appropriate stage the commercial interests, e.g., the publishingtrade and the University presses, which had had experience in thisgeneral field.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Education to arrange for acommittee of officials representing the Foreign Office,Scottish Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, ColonialOffice, the Board of Trade and Ministry of Education toexamine further the problem discussed in CP. (55) 175,and to report to the Cabinet.Four-PowerTalks.(PreviousReference :CM. (55) 36thConclusions,Minute 5.)8. The Foreign Secretary reported to the Cabinet on theconference of Foreign Ministers which had concluded at Genevaon the previous day. He said that the Soviet attitude which, althoughobstructive, was not altogether inflexible at the beginning of theconference, became almost completely rigid following Mr. Molotov&apos;svisit to Moscow during the course of the conference. It was hisimpression, which was shared by the other Western ForeignMinisters, that there were two, underlying reasons for thisremarkable change of attitude. First, the fact that the Sovietauthorities had found that, particularly in the satellite countries,more liberal policies awakened expectations and movements ofopinion which were proving difficult to control; second, the balanceof forces in the Soviet Government was still precariously poisedbetween those who supported the policies of Stalin and those whofavoured a more liberal approach. It was his opinion that theRussians, having established a position of stalemate both in the FarEast (which appeared to suit them) and in Europe, would concentratetheir energies on the Middle East. Our main objective in Europemust now be to hold West German opinion firmly attached to theWest and, to this end, it was in our interest to press ahead with theattachment of German forces to the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation. The mistaken tactic of the Russians in indicating thatthey would not agree to German unity except on a basis which wouldpreserve Communist gains in East Germany would assist us inholding West German opinion firm.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.
9CM. 41 (55)Pensions.(PreviousReference :CM. (55) 40thConclusions,Minute 8.)9. The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor of theExchequer proposed to announce, in reply to Questions in Parliamentthat day, that the Government had decided that further measuresto assist retired members of the public services were justified, andthat the Government were preparing detailed proposals which wouldbe put before Parliament in the New Year.There was general agreement that, following the Governmenfsearlier statements that they were sympathetically reviewing thisquestion, an announcement on the lines proposed should be madeforthwith.The Minister of Pensions said that on the previous day the HomeAffairs Committee had considered his proposals for negotiating withthe Trades Union Congress a scheme for increasing the disabilitypensions of certain totally disabled persons who at present had torely on workmen&apos;s compensation payments. His proposals had notyet been accepted by the Treasury. An announcement that theGovernment were proposing to increase public service pensionswould increase the pressure of the Trades Union Congress for anincrease in these disability pensions.It was agreed that, if this happened, it could be pointed out thatan increase in public service pensions did not prejudice considerationof an increase in disability pensions.The Cabinet-Agreed that an announcement should be made forthwithof the Governmenfs intention to increase public servicepensions.Cost ofLiving.(PreviousReference :C.C. (54) 57thConclusions,Minute 7)10. The Minister of Labour said that the Retail Prices Indexfor October due to be published on the following day would be152 points as against 150 in September. This increase would addto the pressure for wage claims in the coming months.The rise in the Index was mainly due to increases in food prices,partly seasonal, and also to increases in the price of furniture andnewspapers, and in some areas in rent, rates and gas charges.There had been further price increases since the October figurewas calculated, notably in the prices of cigarettes and coal, and thechanges introduced by the recent Budget would also have some effect.It was therefore likely that there would be some further rise in theIndex for November.In discussion, it was pointed out that it was continuing pressureof demand which resulted from high earnings and full employmentthat kept prices up. There was a continuing demand for betterquality goods, particularly in the case of food. The Minister ofAgriculture said that he hoped to provide the Minister of Labourwith background information which might be useful when the risein the Index for October was announced.The Minister of Pensions said that the rise in the Index was sosubstantial as to make it inevitable that the National AssistanceBoard would seek an increase in the assistance rates.The Minister of Agriculture said that there was some risk of ashortage of potatoes developing and, to forestall this, he proposedthat licences to import potatoes should be issued this year at thebeginning of the winter. He understood that, subject to certainconditions, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had agreed to this. TheMinister of State, Board of Trade, said that he agreed that licences
10should be issued. The earliest date at which they could take effectwould be 26th November.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Minister of Labour andthe Minister of Pensions.(2) Agreed that licences to import potatoes should now beissued, subject to the approval of the Chancellor of theExchequer.ElectoralReform.(PreviousReference:C.C. (54) 87thConclusions,Minute 1.)11, The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (55) 75) seeking their views on the reply which shouldbe given to an all-Party deputation which had been urging that aRoyal Commission should be set up to enquire into alternativeelectoral systems.The Home Secretary said that the deputation, which he hadreceived on behalf of the former Prime Minister earlier in the year,was now pressing for a reply. No useful purpose would be servedby agreeing to set up a Royal Commission to enquire into theelectoral system. Any such enquiry would, in fact, be confined toan examination of the merits of proportional representation aboutwhich enough information was available already. Both the majorpolitical Parties were opposed to proportional representation and aRoyal Commission would be embarrassed by the political nature ofthe subject.The Cabinet agreed with these views.It was pointed out in discussion that the materials existed for acomplete justification to be given to the all-Party deputation forrejecting their proposal.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland, to prepare for the PrimeMinister^ signature, a reply to the all-Party deputationrejecting their request for a Royal Commission on theelectoral system.Industrial 12.   The Minister of Labour said that the workers on strike atDisputes. the Hawker aircraft factory at Blackpool had voted to return towork, and some of the engineering workers of Rolls Royce hadprovisionally decided to return also.On the other hand, the London lightermen had given notice toterminate their present agreement with their employers as from1st January next, and had put in a claim for a substantial increasein wages. The employers would find it hard to meet this demand,because of repercussions on other sections of port workers. Hehoped that serious trouble could be avoided, but if the lightermenwere to strike, the work of the whole port would virtually cease.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th November, 1955.
