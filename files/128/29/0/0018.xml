Conservative 1.   The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a letter which he hadParty, received from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster relinquishingChairmanship, his Chairmanship of the Conservative Party. Lord Woolton feltthat responsibility for the Party organisation should now be handedover to a younger man who could expect to be in charge of it whenthe time came for another General Election.The Prime Minister said that he greatly regretted the necessityfor this decision, though he respected the reasons which had promptedit. He knew that his colleagues in the Cabinet would wish him toexpress on their behalf their warm appreciation of the outstandingservices which Lord Woolton had rendered as Chairman of the Party.Malta.(previous reference:CC. (54) 56thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (CP. (55) 53) on the claim of the malta government for representation in the Parliament at Westminster.The Colonial Secretary said that his colleagues might prefer to postpone discussion of this memorandum until they had had more time to consider it. Meanwhile, they would wish to know that thePrime Minister of Malta, who was now in London, had obtainedassurances that his claim would be supported by the labour opposition in the House of Commons.The Cabinet Agreed that consideration of the Colonial Secretary&apos;smemorandum CP. (55) 53 should be deferred until their next meeting.South Africa.defence -operation.(previous reference:CM. (55) 17thConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Common-wealth Secretary, the Minister of Defence and the First Lord of theAdmiralty (CP. (55) 54) reporting the further progress made in thediscussions with the South African Minister of Defence on defence questions of common concern to the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and of the Union. The draft agreements annexed to thismemorandum had been examined by the Defence Committee at ameeting on the previous day.In discussion of the draft agreement for the transfer of the naval base at Simonstown, the following points were raised:  (a) Paragraph 9 of the draft agreement now provided improvedsafeguards for the future recruitment of coloured workers in the dockyard. The Cabinet agreed that on this point the draft agreement could now be regarded as satisfactory.(b) It was desirable that the detailed provisions contained in the annexes to the draft agreement should be made public. The question had been raised whether publication of the conditions of service forAdmiralty employees at Simonstown (Annex B) might provokedemands for similar conditions at other Admiralty establishmentsoverseas. The Cabinet agreed, however, that this was a risk whichmust be taken in the interest of securing full public support in thiscountry for the transfer of the Simonstown base to South Africa.(c) Paragraph 2 (iv) of Annex C might seem to imply that theAdmiralty were already discriminating extensively, on grounds of race or colour, between different classes of their employees in the simonstown dockyard. The wording of this sub-paragraph mightbe adjusted so as to give less prominence to this point.(d) In sub-paragraphs (vi) and (viii) of paragraph 2 of Annex Cthe wording of the final sentences might be modified so as to make itclear that it was the intention of the Union Government to providefor existing employees in the dockyard the benefits described in thosesub-paragraphs.
ie) The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that UnitedKingdom claims for financial compensation for the assets to betransferred to the South African Government should be settled onthe basis of a lump-sum payment of  750,000. It was, however,important that there should be a clear statement, agreed betweenthe two parties, of all the items which were regarded as covered bythis lump-sum payment.The Cabinet were informed that there were no outstandingdifficulties on the draft agreement on Naval Co-operation.In discussion the point was made that the draft agreement didnot in terms require the South African Government to place theirnaval forces, in war, at the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief,South Atlantic. The Cabinet were assured that the agreement, taken as a whole, would have the effect of ensuring full naval co-operation in this area between South Africa and the United Kingdom in any war in which the two countries were allies.The Cabinefs discussion then turned on the draft agreement onthe defence of Southern Africa and on the draft of a secretundertaking that discussions between the Service Staffs of the twocountries should cover matters relating to South Africa&apos;s participation in the defence of the Middle East (Appendices C and D of cp. (55) 54).The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that there mightbe advantage in holding these two points over for further discussion at a later date. In the current discussions it had proved impossibleto extract any firm promise of South African co-operation in thedefence of the Middle East. We might, however, be in a better position to extract such a promise at a later stage, when further progress had been made in Anglo-American discussions on thedefence of that area. If we were successful in making a firm Anglo-American plan for the defence of the Middle East, involving theUnited States Government in a definite military commitment, itwould be easier to bring pressure on the South African Governmentto make a contribution towards such a plan.As against this it was argued that postponement might jeopardise the prospect of making effective progress through Staff conversations.The Chiefs of Staff believed that these conversations might offer anopportunity for a more practical approach to this problem; and itwas possible that closer contact between the military staffs mightpave the way for a further effort to overcome the political difficultieswhich now stood in the way of a firm South African promise toco-operate in the defence of the Middle East. Although Mr. Erasmuswas not willing that a letter on the lines of the draft in Appendix to  CP. (55) 54 should be made public, it was possible that he mightbe persuaded to agree that some public reference might be made tothe proposal for further Staff discussions, either in a preamble to the relevant agreement or in a Press communique on the results of his mission.The Cabinet agreed that the balance of advantage lay on the side of concluding now a draft agreement on the need for international discussions with regard to the defence of southern africa, on the lines of the draft in Appendix C to CP. (55) 54, coupled with the promise that the ensuing Staff conversations should includematters relating to South Africa&apos;s participation in the defence of theMiddle East.In further discussion the following points were also raised:  (/) It was arguable that the proposed agreement on the simonstown base, as well as that on naval co-operation, should be registered with the United Nations. It was not, however, necessarythat both the parties to the agreements should register them with theUnited Nations. It would suffice if they were registered by theUnited Kingdom Government alone.(g) In this country public opinion might react unfavourably tothe transfer of the Simonstown base unless full details of the
agreement were published at once. It would therefore be preferable that there should be no announcement about the results of the current discussions until the full text of the agreements could be published.This might mean that no announcement could be made before4th July.(h) The substance of the agreements should be communicatedin advance to interested foreign Governments in Africa and theMiddle East and to Colonial Governments in Africa. these communications should, however, be delayed until the last possible moment, so as to reduce the risk of premature disclosures.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Defence, in company with theCommonwealth Secretary and the First Lord of theAdmiralty, to conclude agreements with the South AfricanMinister of Defence on the lines of the drafts annexed to CP. (55) 54 subject to the points noted in paragraphs(c), (d) and (e) above.(2) Invited, the Minister of Defence to arrange for early publication of the texts of the various agreements, havingregard to the views recorded in paragraph (g) above;and to concert with the Colonial Secretary and theMinister of State for Foreign Affairs arrangements for communicating advance information of the substance ofthe agreements to other interested Governments.Aden.Security of the protectorate.(previous reference:CM. (55) 17thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet were informed that the Defence Committeehad reviewed on the previous day the measures to be taken, both inthe short term and in the long term, for improving the security ofthe Aden Protectorate.The Chiefs of Staff had arranged for the Army and Air ForceCommanders-in-Chief, Middle East, to proceed at once to Aden to review the long-term measures for improving security in the protectorate.Meanwhile a large-scale operation was about to be undertaken with the aim of punishing the dissident tribe, the Shamsi, if theycould be brought to battle. It had originally been intended that,as part of this operation, the Government Guards should be withdrawn from the Fort at Robat and that arrangements shouldbe made for it to be held in future by tribesmen of a friendly tribe,the Humeidi. The Governor of Aden had, however, been asked toconsider whether, if the Government Guards were to be withdrawn,it would not be preferable that the Fort should be destroyed.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.House ofCommonsDisqualification,Draft Bill.(previous reference:CM. (55) 14thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (55) 49) on three points raised in their previous discussion on the House of Commons Disqualification Bill.The Home Secretary said that he had now discussed these pointswith his colleagues in the Home Affairs Committee and their recommendations were set out in his memorandum. If these recommendations were accepted by the Cabinet, he would proceedto consult the Northern Ireland Government and the opposition parties at Westminster on the provisions of the Bill.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations in CP. (55) 49 and invited the Home Secretary to consult the Northern ireland government and the Opposition Parties at Westminsteron the Bill.
Sinn FeinMembers.Price of Sugar. 6.   The   Chancellor   of   the   Exchequer   recalled   that   on(Previous 20th January the Cabinet had agreed in principle that the priceReference: at which the Government sold sugar to refiners in this country shouldC.C. (55) 5th be increased by an amount which was likely to lead to an increaseConclusions, of \d. a lb. in its retail price. The introduction of this price increaseMinute 11.) had been deferred for some months, but he now recommended thatit should be brought into effect without further delay.Mr. J. C. The Lord Privy Seal said that he hoped that these consultationsGeorge, M.P., could be carried out speedily as the urgency of introducing the bill and Mr. J. had now been increased by the occurrence of another case ofMclnnes, M.P.  disqualification.  The Attorney-General had advised that Mr. J. C.George, the Conservative Member for the Pollok division of Glasgow,would probably be held to be disqualified by the fact of his appointment by the Minister of Works to be a director of the ScottishSlate Industries Company. The Government must therefore moveas soon as possible for the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate the case, and an Indemnity Bill would almost certainly be required thereafter.The Minister of State for Scottish Affairs said that it now seemed possible that another Scottish Member Mr. J. Mclnnes, who sat forthe Central division of Glasgow would be found to have incurreddisqualification on account of his appointment as director of anestate company under the Board of Trade. The Attorney-Generalsaid that this latter case had only just been brought to his notice and he would need rather more time before giving his final view on it.The Cabinet agreed that, if the disqualification of Mr. Mclnneswere confirmed, his case and that of Mr! George should be broughtto the notice of Parliament simultaneously.The Cabinet (2) Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to move for the appointmentof a Select Committee to investigate the case of Mr. J. C.George, M.P., and, if necessary, to arrange thereafter forthe introduction of an Indemnity Bill, and to take similar action in respect of Mr. J. Mclnnes, M.P., if further investigation should show this to be necessary.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Cabinet should also be aware of the position in respect of the Sinn Fein Members returned forFermanagh and South Tyrone and Mid-Ulster, who were at presentserving prison sentences. The Ulster Unionist candidate in SouthTyrone had lodged a petition within the prescribed period of twenty-one days for the unseating of the Sinn Fein Member for thatconstituency and, if this petition were successful, the Ulster Unionistcandidate would automatically be deemed to be elected in place ofthe Sinn Fein Member. In Mid-Ulster, on the other hand, no suchpetition had been lodged, and it rested with the Government to set in motion the procedure for bringing about a fresh election. it seemed right that the necessary action to this end should now betaken.The Cabinet (3) Took note that in the Fermanagh and South Tyroneconstituency the Ulster Unionist Party had lodged a petition for the disqualification of the sitting Sinn FeinMember and the consequent return of the Ulster Unionistcandidate.(4) Agreed that steps should now be taken to establish the disqualification of the sitting Sinn Fein Member formidable-Ulster and the subsequent holding of a bye-election.
legislative programme:1955-56Session.(previous reference:CM. (55) 11thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP. (55) 52) about the current session&apos;s legislative programme.The Lord Privy Seal said that, if the programme was not to fallseriously behind, it was necessary that as many as possible of the bills mentioned in pararaph 5 of his memorandum should beintroduced before the summer recess, and that the Bills mentionedin paragraph 6 should be ready for introduction immediatelyParliament reassembled in the autumn.Discussion showed that there were reasonable expectations thatall save two of the Bills mentioned in paragraph 5 of CP. (55) 52could at least be introduced before the end of July. Although theInventions and Designs (Defence) Bill was ready, the timing of its introduction would need to be considered by the emergency legislation Committee. The Water Bill would not be ready for introduction before the autumn, but The Minister of Housing andLocal Government suggested that he should aim instead to introduce a Rural Water Supply and Sewerage Bill. This suggestion was approved.The following further points were raised in discussion:  (a) It was proposed that the Sugar Bill, when it was published,should be accompanied by an explanatory White Paper, the draft ofwhich would be submitted to the Legislation Committee with thedraft Bill.(b) The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Lord Reading)should ensure that the proposed Bill on Sudan Officials&apos;Compensation was introduced at the earliest possible date.(c) Three years had passed since the policy underlying the geneva Conventions Bill had been approved by the Home AffairsCommittee, and the matter would need to be reconsidered before thedraft Bill could go forward to the Legislation Committee.(d) It was possible that a Revenue Bill could be prepared for introduction in the autumn: this would reduce the scope of nextyear&apos;s Finance Bill.(e) A Slaughterhouses Bill should be added to Annex B to cp. (55) .52.The Prime Minister said that, in view of the importance ofmaking satisfactory progress in this matter during the next four weeks, the Cabinet should review the matter again after a shortinterval.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the addition to the legislative programme of the bills set out in Annex B to CP. (55) 52, and of Billson Rural Water Supply and Sewerage and onSlaughterhouses.(2) Invited the Ministers concerned to ensure that there was no avoidable delay in bringing forward Bills included in theprogramme.(3) Agreed to review the position again at an early meeting.Cyprus.(previous reference:CM. (55) 17thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Prime Minister said that, in view of the continueddisorders in Cyprus, he had thought it necessary that the cabinet should consider as a matter of urgency whether the Governmentshould not take an immediate initiative to restore the situation. Ashe saw it, the Government were faced with a choice betweenThe Minister of Agriculture supported this recommendation.The Cabinet Agreed that the proposed increase in the price of sugar torefiners should now be made.
(i) proclaiming a state of emergency in Cyprus and taking vigorousaction to suppress the dissident elements there; or (ii) securing a suspension of Greek incitements to violence in Cyprus by inviting the Greek and Turkish Governments to send representatives to aconference in London. If the first course were adopted, theGovernment would be obliged to follow for some time a negativepolicy of repression. If the second course were chosen, care wouldhave to be taken to avoid any impression that the Greek or turkish governments had a right to be consulted on the future constitutional development of the Colony. This course had, however, certaintactical advantages. If the Greek and Turkish Governments couldbe brought to confer together on this question, they could probablybe shown to hold different views on the question of self-determinationfor the people of Cyprus; and this would provide us with a valuableopportunity for advancing our own views on the constitutional development of the Colony. The fact that we had offered to confer with these two Governments would also put us in a better positionto defend ourselves against further criticism in the United Nations.Even if the Greek Government refused to attend such a conference,our position in the United Nations would be strengthened by the factthat we had offered it.Discussion showed that there was strong support in the cabinet for the proposal to invite the Greek and Turkish Governments tosend representatives to a conference in London.Discussion turned on the terms of the invitation to be sent to thetwo Governments. It was suggested that, in order to avoid any publicimpression that the question of sovereignty over Cyprus was to bediscussed with foreign Governments, Cyprus should not be the solesubject for discussion at the conference. Emphasis should thereforebe laid on the common interests which the three Governments hadin the political and defence problems of the Eastern Mediterraneanas a. whole. After discussion it was agreed that the invitation to theGreek and Turkish Governments should take the following form:  &quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government have been giving furtherconsideration to the strategic and other problems affecting alikethe United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey in the eastern mediterranean. They consider that the association of the three countries in that area based on mutual confidence is essentialto their common interests.Her Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly invite the greek and Turkish Governments to send representatives to confer withthem in London at an early date on political and defence questions which affect the Eastern Mediterranean, includingCyprus.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to arrangefor invitations to be delivered to the Greek and turkish governments on 30th June, in the terms approved bythe Cabinet, to send representatives to a conference inLondon on political and defence questions affecting theEastern Mediterranean, including Cyprus.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would announce, in astatement in the House of Commons on 30th June, thatthese invitations had been sent.(3) Authorised the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs toarrange for the United States Government to be informed of this on 29th June and to be urged to press the GreekGovernment to accept the invitation.(4) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for theGovernments of Canada, Australia and New Zealand tobe informed of this initiative&apos; shortly before the public announcement was made.
IndustrialDock Strike.(previous reference:CM. (55) 16thConclusions,Minute 5.)9. The Minister of Labour said that, in spite of the advice oftheir leaders that they should resume work, between 18,000 and20,000 members of the National Amalgamated Stevedores andDockers (N.A.S.D.) were still on strike. The Disputes Committee of the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C), who were considering thematters at issue between the N.A.S.D. and the Transport and general works Union (T.G.W.U.), were meeting that day and were expectedto submit their report to the T.U.C. for consideration on the following day. The Minister said that, although the T.U.C. might come down on the side of the T.G.W.U., it was difficult to see how that Unioncould refuse indefinitely to accept the fact that 10,000 dockers onMerseyside were firmly determined to have nothing to do with them.Discussions had been held on the previous day with the port employers, who were seriously concerned about the situation. TheMinister said that he would be in a better position to say whether there was any further step which the Government could usefullytake when he knew what decision the T.U.C. had taken on the reportof their Disputes Committee.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour and National Service toreport further on this question at their next meeting.Monopolies 10.   The President of the Board of Trade said that he would beand Restrictive publishing on 30th June the report of the Monopolies CommissionPractices. on collective boycott and exclusive dealing.  This report was likely(Previous to give rise to considerable public controversy and, in view of the reference: complexity of the subject, he would be glad if its recommendationsCM. (55) 15th could be considered in the first instance by a Cabinet Committee.Conclusions,Minute 4.) The Cabinet Appointed a Committee consisting of-Lord Chancellor (Chairman),Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,President of the Board of Trade,Minister of Supply,Attorney-General,Economic Secretary, Treasury,to consider and report to the Cabinet on the report of the monopolies Commission on collective boycott and exclusivedealing.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th June, 1955.
