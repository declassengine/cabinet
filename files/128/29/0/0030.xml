1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the foreign secretary (CP. (55) 117) covering a draft memorandum of the viewsof Her Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the constitutional development and the international status of Cyprus which he proposed to place before the Tripartite Conference during the courseof that week. The Cabinet also had before them a memorandumby the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs (CP. (55) 115) covering the outline of a form of liberal constitution for Cyprus.The Foreign Secretary said that, although slow, the discussions in the Tripartite Conference during the previous week had led toencouraging results in two important respects. First, all the three governments concerned had set before the Conference a clear statement of their respective positions in the matter, and the greek and Turkish Governments had been persuaded to agree that theirviews, along with those of the United Kingdom, should be set outin a joint communique which had been published. This was aconsiderable gain. The Greek Government, as had been expected,were hoping to achieve internal self-government for Cyprus on terms which would lead, within five years or so, to self-determination infavour of union with Greece. But they had abandoned their pressure for union forthwith and for a plebiscite designed to achieve this.This was the second most important outcome of the Conference todate. The Turkish Government wanted neither internal self-government nor self-determination for Cyprus and were strongly against any change in the present status and administration of cyprus. If there were to be any change in status they were againstthe transfer of sovereignty to anyone but themselves. They took the view that the Treaty of Lausanne could not be modified piecemealwithout reference to questions relating to Thrace and the DodecaneseIslands which had also been regulated by that Treaty. It was not an unreasonable view for Turkey to hold that Cyprus, which covered the &quot; back door &quot; of entry into Turkey, should not fall into weakhands.We for our part were prepared to concede self-government butnot self-determination. Self-determination was the crucial issuebecause he had no doubt that the Turkish authorities, while notspecially favouring self-government, would be quite willing to support us on this if they were fully satisfied that we had no intention ofyielding on the international status of the Island. It was thereforefor the Cabinet to decide how the question of self-determinationshould be handled in the further stages of the Conference. On theassumption that it would not be practicable to announce categoricallythat self-determination could never be conceded he was not in favourof accepting any commitment to consult again on the question ofself-determination at any specific date in the future, say in ten years&apos;time; that would certainly be taken to imply that the eventual rightto self-determination had been conceded and would simply encourage the Greeks to press continuously for an earlier date for consultation on this issue. He considered it would be less dangerous to run therisk of having the matter raised at any time in the standing tripartitemachinery for consultation on Cyprus questions which his memorandum proposed should be set up and, if the matter were tobe raised, to maintain the position we had already indicated. Hecould not tell, however, whether the Greeks would be prepared toagree to his proposals and, unless we were prepared simply to surrender to them, he foresaw a. long and difficult period ahead in cyprus which would have to be handled as a joint political andmilitary operation aimed at getting the moderate people on our side and at isolating the extremists. It was with this in mind that he proposed to set up a special tripartite committee which would serve as a standing instrument of consultation between the three governments on the problems which would arise in introducing a constitution. He thought that with such a body known to be inconstant session the risk of the situation deteriorating to the pointof a general breakdown of administration or even revolution oughtCyprus.(previous reference:CM. (55) 29thConclusions,Minute 4.)
to be greatly lessened. He intended to put the proposals in his memorandum orally to the Conference in the first instance. He was certain, however, to be pressed on the question of self-determination.Discussion in the Cabinet turned mainly on this issue.The Colonial Secretary said that it was a remarkable step forward to have reached some agreement with the Greeks on thequestion of a constitution. But, unless there were an acceptanceof the principle that at some time the Cypriots would be given anopportunity to express themselves on the question of self-determination, he thought the constitution would fail. As he hadnot had an opportunity of himself assessing the strength of theTurkish position, he did not dissent from the Foreign Secretary&apos;sproposals, but he would prefer some commitment to be willing todiscuss the question of self-determination if and when theinternational situation might improve. As the views of the TurkishGovernment on Cyprus were, he thought, governed mainly by their concern for the security of their southern ports, he wondered whether they could not be induced to agree to such a solution.If not, he thought that, at the least, it would be helpful if the foreign secretary were to make some reference to eventual further discussionof the &quot; future status &quot; of the Island. The Cypriots themselves hada vested interest in their future and would not want to see the Islandswamped by the Greeks.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet must bear in mind that this was not merely a question whether a country should beallowed to govern itself but an international issue of the mostexplosive character. The leader of the Turkish delegation had made it clear to him that the Turks would support us as long as we remained firm on the question of self-determination. But as soonas there were any indication that the Island might go to Greece atsome future date there would undoubtedly be a breach between theTurks and the Greeks and an end to the Greco-Turkish Alliance,It was essential to avoid leaning so far towards the Greeks as to risk alienating the Turks. The Conference would have the effectof making it clear to international opinion that this was not purelya Greek issue. The Greeks, he thought, were now more doubtfulof the strength of their position. He himself saw no choice but tofollow the course proposed by the Foreign Secretary.It was the general view of the Cabinet, after further discussion,that in putting his proposals to the Conference the Foreign secretary should give no undertaking which would imply any willingness tomake concessions in the future on the question of self-determination.The Cabinet, in considering the Foreign Secret ary&apos;s memorandum(CP. (55) 117) and various amendments which he proposed to it,agreed that the references to self-determination in relation to thefuture international status of Cyprus in paragraphs 3 and 11 shouldbe deleted and agreed that the undertaking to call the Conferencetogether again when a new constitution had come into working orderin Cyprus should simply be a commitment to &quot; review the situationin all its aspects including the question of security in the eastern mediterranean.&quot; It was - also agreed to abandon altogether theproposal in paragraph 7 of the memorandum providing for theappointment of Greek and Turkish representatives to reside in cyprus to observe the application of the new constitutional arrange-ments on the ground that this would encourage the Cypriots to looktoo much to these representatives. The Cabinet also agreed withother drafting amendments which the Foreign Secretary proposed.Internal The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the MinistersSecurity. concerned were meeting that night to consider further steps for strengthening internal security in the Island.   This was likely to prove a difficult problem.
The Cabinet Endorsed the proposals contained in CP. (55) 117 subject tothe amendments which had been agreed in the cabinets discussion.Chief Joseph 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that Her Majesty&apos;s Minister atBam. Washington had now presented a strongly worded note protesting against the decision of the United States Government to reject thetenders made by a British firm for contracts for equipment for theChief Joseph Dam. It had been intended that the text of this protestshould be published after a suitable interval during which the UnitedStates Government might wish to reply to it, but it was arguable that publication would play into the hands of protectionist interests in theUnited States. The Government would in any case have anopportunity of making their views known in due course, sinceQuestions on this matter were bound to be asked when parliament reassembled.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the extent to whichthe United States was in fact carrying out the liberal trade policy that had been proclaimed by the President was extremely disappointing,and he proposed to make strong representations to this effect to theSecretary of the United States Treasury at the forthcoming meeting ofthe International Monetary Fund in Istanbul. Unless the UnitedStates Government were prepared in fact to follow more liberalpolicies we might be forced to make a substantial reappraisal of our external economic policy, and in that event would have to expressplainly our disappointment with the trade policy of the United States.Further discussion showed that it was the general view of theCabinet that the question whether or not to publish the text of theprotest should be decided in the light of any reply which might bereceived from the United States Government and of the response ofthe Secretary of the United States Treasury to the representations which the Chancellor of the Exchequer intended to make to him.The Cabinet Agreed to resume consideration of this matter at a,later meeting.Supply of arms to the middle east.French Aircraft.(previous reference:CM. (55) 27thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that, in spite of the objections which we and the United States had raised in the Middle East ArmsCo-ordinating Committee, the French authorities had gone ahead with their proposal to supply swept-wing French Mystere aircraft to Israel. Both we and the United States considered it inadvisable thatfast aircraft of this type should be in the possession of Middle Eastcountries and were not prepared to supply them ourselves. TheFrench had now requested staging facilities in Cyprus for the delivery of these aircraft, of which the first batch of six was due to go later this month. This placed us in something of a dilemma. It wouldhave a bad effect on the Arab States and would also be disturbingto Turkey for Israel to possess these aircraft. On the other hand, asan air power, it was in our general interest that transit facilities allover the world should be accorded without hindrance and it might seta precedent with damaging repercussions if we were to refuse to accord the French facilities in Cyprus. In any case, we could not prevent the French from delivering the aircraft since they might befound to have the range to fly direct or could be crated. The currentdisturbances in Gaza might, however, provide us with an opportunityfor a diplomatic approach to the French and the United States
Malaya.(previous reference:CM. (55) 25thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Colonial Secretary informed the Cabinet that an amnesty would be announced by the Government of Malaya on 8th September, to become effective on 9th September. It would bemade clear in it that restrictions would have to be placed on the liberty of some of those who surrendered, and it was gratifying thatMalayan Ministers had agreed to this condition being included.The cabinet took note of this statement.EconomicSituation.(previous reference:CM. (55) 29thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Cabinet continued their review of the current economicsituation. In addition to the memoranda on this subject by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (CP. (55) 98) and the lord president (CP. (55) 106), they had before them memoranda on thegeneral situation by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (55) 111) and thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP. (55) 118), and a memorandumon housing policy by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (55) 116).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that during, august the reserves of gold and dollars had fallen by $87 millions to$2,457 millions. This fall was considerably less than in July, butthere would be a further substantial loss in September, partly onaccount of the current deficit of  28 millions with the european payments Union. These losses to the reserves were not, of course,as serious as the fall in 1951, but there was no sign that the situation would quickly right itself. The measures to restrict credit that hadalready been introduced were undoubtedly taking effect; but the tradefigures, although improving, still showed a substantial excess ofimports, and it was not certain how long it would be in present economic conditions before the credit restrictions would have their full impact.To restore confidence in sterling and to avoid a run on the reserves, some further corrective measures were unavoidable. Itwould be best if these were announced before the annual conferencesof the Conservative and Labour Parties, which were to be held earlyin October. The measures he had in mind would make it necessaryto introduce a Budget in the autumn and he therefore proposed that parliament should be recalled for a few days in the last week ofSeptember simply to deal with the economic situation, and should thereafter again be adjourned until 25th October.Governments suggesting that they should join with us in imposing aban upon the delivery of all arms while the present dispute lasts.This would be a temporary solution.The Prune Minister said that it was unfortunate that the french should insist on breaking rules which we were prepared to keep.The supply of these aircraft would alter the balance of millitary power in the Middle East. He hoped that the matter could again bereferred to the Co-ordinating Committee and meanwhile agreed withthe proposal that we should try to secure a temporary ban on thesupply of all arms.The Cabinet Agreed that, in order to prevent the early delivery of FrenchMystere aircraft to Israel and to give time for furtherconsideration of the matter, a diplomatic approach shouldbe made to the French and United States Governmentssuggesting a ban on the shipment of all arms to Israel and egypt while the present frontier disturbances continued.
To reduce the overload on the economy, the Chancellor outlineda number of measures to reduce expenditure by the Government, localauthorities and the nationalised industries, and to restrain consumerdemand in general.As regards Government expenditure, he looked for a reductionin defence, which would release manpower and afford some relief to the metal-using industries. He favoured a substantial reductionin the housing subsidies leading to the eventual elimination of thegeneral needs subsidy. It would not be possible to undertake anextension of the roads programme, and some saving would beobtained by restraining Post Office development and by postponing the construction of large Government buildings. Similarly, someslowing up of the capital investment plans of the nationalised industries, other than atomic development and the coal industry,would be necessary. He also proposed to consult with the ministers concerned about the terms of a circular letter which should besent to local authorities stressing the need for economy in theifexpenditure.In the private sector, at the request of the Federation of BritishIndustries, he proposed to make an appeal to industry to avoid ailunnecessary capital expenditure at the present time.He had not yet finally decided whether it would be possible torecommend the abolition of the bread subsidy, but its effect was directly inflationary to the extent of  40 millions a year. He also hadin mind a reduction in the subsidy on school meals.As regards fiscal measures, he had it in mind to make an attackon excessive consumption by certain increases in the rates of purchase tax. This was the quickest method of controlling personal consumption. He proposed to discuss with the Ministers concernedhow rates of purchase tax could be adjusted in such a way as to achieve this objective and at the same time free supplies for export.He had discussed with the Prime Minister the problem ofbalancing these various measures so that the burden would fallequitably on all sections of the community. A capital gains tax would undoubtedly have the merit of attracting support from the tradeunions; but he feared that, apart from the serious objections to thistax which had been noted by the Royal Commission on Taxation,the administrative difficulties in the way of introducing it wereinsuperable. He was therefore inclined to favour the relatively simplecourse of increasing the tax on distributive profits. Finally, hewould naturally bear in mind the possibility of a further increase inthe Bank Rate.The Prime Minister endorsed the proposal to recall parliament before the end of September, so that further measures could beintroduced which would show the country that the Government wasdealing with the economic situation firmly and fairly. He said thathe saw some danger that the control of moderate elements over theTrade Unions might be weakened: the Governmenfs ability to meet any challenge in this direction might well depend on whether theyhad convinced the country that they were prepared to keep a fair balance between the interests of different sections of the community.He agreed broadly with the proposals outlined by the Chancellorof the Exchequer. Housing was one of the most important humanneeds and he recognised that the proposals relating to the subsidycould not be expected to be popular in the country at large. he felt that increases in purchase tax would be acceptable and couldbe defended if they were seen to be designed to help exports. Hewas examining, in consultation with his colleagues, whether the periodof National Service could be reduced so as to make more labour available, but it would not be possible to reduce the period immediately to eighteen months. He thought consideration might begiven to certain expedients which would have the effect of offsettingsomewhat the severity of the burdens which it would be necessaryto impose on some sections of the community in order to make the
totality of the measures rather more palatable. An increase in theprice of bread would present special complications which put it in aseparate category from the other measures proposed.The Cabinet were in general agreement with the necessity for measures of the character outlined by the Chancellor of theExchequer. Their discussion turned mainly on the means of achieving a proper balance.It was argued that an increase in purchase tax, or the abolitionof the bread subsidy, would be contrary to the Governments aim off reducing prices; the latter measure, in particular, might berepresented as an attack on working-class standards. Such measures would be likely to stimulate the pressure for higher wages, and wouldalso lead to demands for increases in national assistance and pensionsrates. On the other hand, if corrective measures were to be successful,they were bound to affect the general body of consumers, and would therefore tend to strengthen the demand for increased wages. Themeasures ought clearly to be balanced by, some action to restrainprofits, but this should not be done in such a way as to imply thatthe Government believed that the inflationary pressure was dueprimarily to excessive profits.It might also be possible to offset the effects of some of theproposed measures by compensating vulnerable classes. In thisconnection the Cabinet were informed that a Pensions Increase bill would shortly be submitted for their approval.In further discussion it was argued that the root of the problemstill lay in the fact that incomes had been rising faster than output and that the ultimate solution could only be in increased productivity.The Minister of Housing said that, although it could not yet be claimed that the housing shortage had been overcome, he agreedthat it was necessary for the building programme to be slowed down.This could best be done by financial measures, rather than byrationing the number of houses which local authorities could build.The system of housing allocations should therefore be brought to anend, and the general housing subsidy should be reduced from  22 15.to  10. The subsidy on houses already approved would not beaffected, and the subsidy for houses built to re-house slum dwellersor to accommodate overspill should be rounded up to a figure of 24 per house. The rate at which houses were being started to meetgeneral needs with the reduced subsidy could be reviewed at half-yearly intervals and, if it were found that the number of houses beingstarted was still excessive, the possibility of reducing the generalsubsidy still further could be considered.This change in the housing subsidy arrangements had alreadybeen recognised to be desirable, and it would not be right to present it simply as one of the measures necessary to deal with the present economic situation. With the abolition of the allocation system, theGovernment ought no longer to be responsible for achieving anannual total housing target; but the rate of house building ought notto be allowed to fall below 250,000 a year. At the same time, theGovernment ought to make it clear that they recognised the close connection between subsidies and rent control, and should indicatethat it was their intention, after the new rating valuations had been introduced, to deal with the problem of rent restriction.In further discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The changes in housing subsidy arrangements proposed werenot inconsistent with the housing targets already announced, since thenumber of completions in 1956, and probably in 1957, would still beabout 300,000 a year.(b) Some means should be found of making saving more attractive to small savers. Would it be possible to guarantee to saversthat they would be repaid the full original value of their savings,despite any fall in the value of money?   The Colonial Secretary said
Malta.(previous reference:CM. (55) 26thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Lord Chancellor said that a Committee of ministers under his chairmanship would shortly consider a report by officials on the economic, financial, social and constitutional implications of possible schemes of closer association between the United Kingdomand Malta. They would have to consider to what extent it would benecessary for United Kingdom Ministers attending the Round table conference to give a lead to the members of the Conference on anumber of points which were certain to be raised. The conference was due to begin on 19th September and the Cabinet should have anopportunity of endorsing the policy to be followed.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor to circulate a report on theline to be taken by Ministers at the Round table conference, for consideration by the Cabinet at a meetingon 15th September.that he was examining whether encouragement could be given to smallsavers to invest in Colonial Loans.(c) Apart from a reduction in the period of National Service, andthe possibility of postponing call-up, it was suggested that it might bepossible to secure some saving in manpower on defence by makinggreater use of Colonial troops, not necessarily in their own territories.(d) If the period of National Service was to be reduced, somestimulus to regular recruiting would be necessary, and this would entail improvements in Service pay and living conditions.(e) A draft White Paper dealing with industrial relations in thepresent economic situation was in course of preparation. This mightbe published in conjunction with the measures to deal with theeconomic situation.(/) It was unavoidable that the result of some of the measures proposed would be to discourage investment which was necessary inour longer-term economic interests. The postponement of thedevelopment of the transport system was regrettable, and any-prolonged delay in expanding the roads programme would be especially harmful.Finally, the Cabinet considered the time-table for the introductionof the measures to be proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.It was agreed that it would be necessary to recall Parliament for26th or 27th September, and that notices to this effect would have to beissued on about 21st September. The Leaders of the opposition parties would have to be informed of the Governmenfs intention onabout 20th September.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would return fromIstanbul on 20th September. He would then be in a position to makefinal proposals to the Cabinet and would take into account the suggestions made in this discussion.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip to make recommendations to the Prime Minister about thearrangements necessary for the recall of Parliament on26th or 27th September.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Labour, to circulate a draft of a white paper on industrial relations in the present economicsituation, with a view to its publication in connection withthe measures to deal with the economic situation.(3) Agreed to resume discussion of the economic situation at ameeting on 22nd September.
Japan.Trade andPaymentsNegotiations.(previous reference:CM. (55) 29thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the state of thenegotiations for a new trade and payments agreement with Japan.They had before them (i) a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP. (55) 103) covering a report by officials on the negotiations,(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of State, Board of Trade(CP. (55) 104) on the question of Japanese access to Colonial markets,and (hi) a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP. (55) 108) re-stating the objectives to be sought in the negotia-tions, together with (iv) a further note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. (55) 114) covering a copy of a minute which he had submitted to the Prime Minister, summarising the conclusions reached in Ministerial discussions following the Cabinefs previousconsideration of this question.This minute stated that the Ministers concerned had agreed thatit was desirable to obtain certain further undertakings from Japan(described in the Annex to CP. (55) 114) in addition to the objectives which had previously been set out in paragraph 5 of CP. (55) 108, inorder to provide a safeguard against Japanese discrimination againststerling area exports and to ensure that the import quotas we would obtain from the Japanese would not be frustrated by administrativedevices. If all these requirements were accepted by the Japaneseit would be less difficult for the Government to defend an agreement which involved an increase in Japanese exports to the Colonies,although there would still be criticism on that score. It was recommended that negotiations should be resumed with a view to obtaining all these objectives, including the additional undertakings.At a later stage, in the light of the Japanese response, ministers could take a final decision on the question of Japanese access toColonial markets.The Cabinet-Endorsed the conclusions contained in the minute attachedto CP. (55) 114.bechuanaland protectorate.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 58thConclusions,Minute 10.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (CP. (55) 112) reporting the presentposition about the chieftainship of the Bamangwato Tribe in respectof which representations had recently been received from the LabourParty. The memorandum stated that the Tribe had not yet broughtthemselves to designate a new chief, in place of Seretse Khama whowas still in this country, and that Rasebolai was still in process ofestablishing his position as &quot; Native Authority:&quot; In a discussion witha deputation from the Labour Party, led by Mr. James Griffiths, ithad been made clear that the Government could not agree to call aconference of tribal representatives for talks with Seretse Khama asthe Labour Party had proposed. The Commonwealth Secretary had since written to Mr. Griffiths pointing out that the Government couldnot change this policy, but that when a new chief had establishedhimself the possibility of Seretse&apos;s return to the Bamangwato Reserveas a private citizen would be sympathetically considered.The Cabinet Took note with approval of CP. (55) 112.Palestine.(previous reference:CM. (55) 27thConclusions,Minute 2.)9. In reporting briefly on the current situation abroad, theForeign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the announcement bythe United States Secretary of State regarding a settlement of thedispute between the Arab States and Israel and the supportingstatement made on behalf of the United Kingdom. Government had had a reasonably satisfactory reception. Attention had been concentrated more on the hostilities at Gaza, where the situation was
still somewhat obscure. It had, however, now been agreed that attheir next meeting the Security Council of the United Nations shouldtake note of the situation at Gaza.The Prime Minister said that he was most anxious that everything possible should be done to ensure speedy delivery of the tanks we had undertaken to supply to Iraq, as part of the conditions on which the announcement of the plan for the settlement of thedispute between the Arab States and Israel had been made.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Bfeanmament.(previous reference:CM. (55) 29thConclusions,Minute 6.)10. The Foreign Secretary briefly informed the Cabinet of theprogress of the United Nations Disarmament Sub-committee meeting. The Western representatives had agreed to concentrate onthe problem of control. The United Kingdom still adhered broadlyto the Anglo-French disarmament proposals, but we acknowledge thedifficulty of control of nuclear weapons, as the Russians themselvesrecognised in their own proposals. The Americans were concentrating on the development of their proposal for an exchange between theUnited States and the Soviet Union of blueprints of military installations and of aerial surveys; but, if we were to participate inthis plan, it would have to be made a multilateral one.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th September, 1955.
