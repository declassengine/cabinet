industrial disputes.Railways.(previous reference :CM. (55) 6thConclusions,Minute 6.)\1. The Minister of Labour said that there was reason to believethat the leaders of the Associated Society of Locomotive engineers and Firemen (A.S.L.E.F.) would welcome some means of avoiding the threatened strike by the Society&apos;s members. The Trades UnionCongress (T.U.C.) had made some progress towards the promotion of agreement on a formula which would enable discussions to be opened between representatives of the A.S.L.E.F. and the british transport Commission, not on the substance of the A.S.L.E.F.&apos;claim on differentials, but on the procedure for arranging furthertalks embracing also the National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.).It seemed likely that the Transport Commission would agree to take part in such discussions, without any commitment in advance, if theA.S.L.E.F. accepted, at least for the time being, the award of theRailway Staff National Tribunal and suspended its strike noticesindefinitely. The Minister said that this plan offered no more than apossibility of averting the strike, but he hoped the Cabinet would agree that he should accede to any request from the T.U.C. that heshould offer facilities for the holding of such discussions, although he did not propose to take any active part in them himself, at anyrate at the outset.The Cabinet -(1) Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.(2) Authorised the Minister of Labour to offer facilities for the holding of talks between the British transport commission and the railway unions on the basis outlinedto the Cabinet.The Cabinet then considered the draft of the statement on the threatened strike which the Minister of Labour proposed to makein the House of Commons that afternoon. Various amendments of the draft were suggested and approved in the Cabinefs discussion.The Cabinet (3) Took note that the Minister of Labour would make astatement on the threatened strike in the House ofCommons that afternoon on the general lines approved in their discussion.The Cabinet were reminded that it would be necessary to decidenot later than 28th April whether the Post Office should be provided with the 500 troops which would be needed from the outset of astrike to maintain long-distance carriage of mails.The Postmaster-General said that, to avoid any risk of a breakdown in the delivery of mails, it would be necessary, if the threatened strike occurred, that the Post Office should have these500 troops at its disposal from midnight on 1st May. The mailswould, however, continue to be delivered to, and collected from,railway stations by Post Office staff.The Cabinet recognised that cancellation of week-end leave, even for so small a number as 500, might become publicly known andmight give rise to misconceptions about the use to which troops wereto be put. They agreed that this risk must be accepted but that astatement should be prepared, for issue if required, explaining the limited use to which these 500 men were to be put.The Cabinet (4) Authorised the Secretary of State for War to take discreetaction, if necessary, to put 500 Army drivers and lorriesat the disposal of the Postmaster-General from midnight on 1st May.(5) Invited the Home Secretary to prepare and submit to thePrime Minister the draft of a statement explaining thefunctions which these 500 troops would undertake in theevent of a strike.
5ppCotton.(previous reference:CM. (55) 5th.Conclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the possible meansof easing the current difficulties of the Lancashire cotton industry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was still his viewthat the proper remedy was to impose a quota on imports of greycotton cloth not only from India but from all commonwealth countries. He believed that the Government would eventually be forced to adopt that course. He recognised, however, that it couldnot be adopted at the present time partly because it wouldextinguish the prospect that India would lower her duties on importsof cotton textiles from Lancashire, and partly because this was not an opportune moment to open the general issue of ending the systemof free entry for Commonwealth goods. He had therefore consideredvery carefully whether he could make any further concession onpurchase tax, in addition to the reduction which he had already announced in his Budget Speech, but he was very doubtful whetherthis could be justified. The leaders of the cotton industry would notbe content with anything less than the complete withdrawal of purchase tax from cotton textiles, both cloth and made-up articles;and this, together with consequential adjustments which could not be avoided, would cost the Exchequer  42 millions. If cotton clothalone were wholly exempted from purchase tax, the additional cost tothe Exchequer would be only  3 millions in a full year. But this course was open to many objections. Thus, there would be strong pressure from Yorkshire for a similar concession in respect of woollen cloth.There would be serious administrative difficulties in collecting thepurchase tax which would still be payable on made-up cottongarments, and some risk of tax evasion. Traders, who dislikedpurchase tax, would be encouraged to re-double their efforts to securethe withdrawal of the tax or its radical revision; and the exchequer could not at present afford to risk the collapse of a tax which yieldedabout  350 millions a year. Other concessions, such as raising the&quot; D &quot; levels or reducing the purchase tax on clothing, were not likelyto give significant relief to the industry. Minor concessions were,he thought, likely to do as much harm as good.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be inexpedient to impose at the present time a quota on imports of greycotton cloth from Commonwealth countries. It was, however, theview of the Cabinet that India&apos;s prospective lowering of her duties on imports of Lancashire textiles was not likely to satisfy the politicaldemand in Lancashire for further Government action to relieve thecurrent difficulties of the cotton industry. It thus appeared that this demand could only be satisfied by a further concession on purchase tax. In discussion there was support for the view that, if such a concession had to be made, it should take the form of a further reduction in the level of purchase tax on cotton cloth. On the otherhand it was important that the Government should not appear tobe yielding progressively to political pressure from the lancashire cotton interests. It was also inexpedient that the Opposition shouldbe enabled to claim that any further concession was due to their action in moving a prayer for the annulment of this purchase taxOrder. On both grounds it was undesirable that any further concession on purchase tax should be announced in the debate on this order which was to take place in the House of Commons on28th April. It was preferable that the Cabinet should reserve a finaldecision until the following week, when they could hope to knowhow far the Indian Government were prepared to go in reducing their duties on imports of Lancashire textiles into India. If it thenappeared that the Indian concession was not enough to satisfy opinion in Lancashire, that might be a reason for making some furtheradjustment in the purchase tax arrangements; and the Governmentsfinal decision could be presented on that basis in the general statement on the difficulties of the cotton industry which would have to bemade before Parliament dissolved.
At the end of the Cabinefs discussion, The Chancellor of theExchequer said that, while he would still feel reluctant to make anyfurther reduction in the rate of purchase tax on cotton cloth, he agreed that the Government&apos;s final decision should be deferred untilthe following week.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to take all practicable steps to ensure that the United Kingdom Governmentwould be made aware, by 2nd May, of the Indian Govern-menfs decision on the future level of their duties on imports of Lancashire textiles into India, and would beauthorised to make that decision public in the statement which would have to be made in the House of Commonsnot later than 5th May.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at ameeting early in the following week.Austria.(previous reference:CM. (55) 4thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (55) 12) on the future international status of Austria.The Foreign Secretary said that the Ambassadors of the fouroccupying Powers were to meet in Vienna on 2nd May, together withAustrian representatives, to prepare the way for the signature of anAustrian State Treaty. He sought the views of his colleagues on theinstructions to be given to our representative at these talks on twoparticular points:  (i) Should we be ready to recognise an Austrian declaration of neutrality of the type practised by Switzerland?(ii) Should we be ready to participate in a four-Power guarantee of Austrian territorial integrity and inviolability?He recommended that we should be ready to agree to recognise anAustrian declaration of neutrality provided that it did not takea form which would debar Austria from joining European and world organisations of a non-military character. On participation in any guarantee of Austrian territorial integrity and inviolabilityhe could make no final recommendation until the nature of anyproposed guarantee was more clearly defined. It might vary froma collective guarantee, only operative if all the guarantors agreed,that it should come into effect, to one of a variety of individualguarantees which could be either binding or permissive so far as theguarantor was concerned. At this stage he suggested that our representative should enter the talks on the basis that we wereprepared in principle to consider participating in a suitable form of guarantee of Austrian territorial integrity and inviolability. Hewould make a further report to the Cabinet before any definitecommitment was accepted.The Cabinet Approved generally the proposals made in CP. (55) 12.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th April, 1955.
