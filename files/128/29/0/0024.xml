1. The Cabinet had before them the draft of a passage whichthe Minister of Fuel and Power proposed to include in his speech inthe debate on coal which was to take place in the House of commons on 20th July. This referred particularly to the need for a sharpreduction in coal exports in 1956.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be best toavoid specifying the extent of this reduction, in order to give as muchlatitude as possible to the National Coal Board and the Board ofTrade in negotiating agreements with other countries involving theexport of coal. It was, however, recognised that, if the Governmentwere heavily pressed in the debate, it might be necessary to give a range of figures indicating the extent to which it might be necessaryto reduce exports. It would not be desirable to say that we were making special efforts to meet the needs of any particular countries,since if this were done for one country, others would press their claims for special treatment.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he would consult thePresident of the Board of Trade about the terms in which he should refer to the possibility that some breach of Governmental and commercial obligations was likely to be involved.The Minister also informed the Cabinet that in the course of his speech in the debate he proposed to mention the need for greater efficiency in the use of fuel, the help which was expected from thepolicy of substituting oil for coal, and the fact that the Governmenthad set in train a broad reorganisation of the industry on the general lines of the Fleck Report. At the present time, 20,000 men were engaged on the reconstruction of pits, and this inevitably affectedoutput. Current criticism of the industry was also adversely affectingproduction. The figures for the previous week had been very bad,and the National Union of Mineworkers were less well-disposed towards the idea of resuming the importation of foreign mineworkers.As regards the allegation that the recent increase in the price of coalhad been delayed for political reasons, he would point out that theGovernment were justified in asking the National Coal Board toconsider very carefully their proposals for price increases of this order, particularly in view of the recent reconstitution of the Board.The Cabinet Endorsed the line which the Minister of Fuel and Powerproposed to follow in the forthcoming debate.Coal.(previous references:CM. (55) 23rdConclusions,Minute 1 and cc. (55) 22ndConclusions,Minute 5.)Remuneration        2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had given of Ministers.    further consideration to the means of sounding the Leaders of the(Previous        Opposition Parties, before Parliament adjourned for the summerReference:      recess,  about increasing the remuneration  of Ministers.    AnyCM. (55) 23rd  proposals put to them at this stage ought to be of a modest nature,Conclusions,    and could perhaps be limited to the remuneration of Junior Ministers.Minute 3.)       He accordingly proposed to formulate proposals which would affectthe remuneration of Junior Ministers only, and would then consider with the Lord Privy Seal, whether there would be advantage in discussing these proposals informally with the Opposition before the recess.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.
housing subsidies.(previous reference:CM. (55) 23rdConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Minister of Housing sought the approval of the cabinet for the replies he proposed to give to Parliamentary Questions for answer that day about the decline in the rate of house building by-local authorities compared with the increase in private housebuilding.The Minister of Housing said that it was now becoming clear from the published figures that some restriction was being imposed on the housing programmes of local authorities and that nocomparable restrictions were being imposed on private building. Thetotal number of houses likely to be completed in the current year was between 320,000 and 330,000, compared&quot;with 350,000 in 1954. within this satisfactory total, there would be a substantial decline in thenumber built by local authorities, and an increase in the numberbuilt by private enterprise.In discussion it was suggested that some restraint was being applied to private building through the Governments present policyof credit restriction; this was some answer to the suggestion thatrestrictions were being imposed only on local authorities. Also,although a limit had been put on new housing programmes of localauthorities, it had been agreed that the Ministry of Housing shouldhave some latitude, within a limit of 10,000 extra houses, to meetspecial problems in certain towns. This should enable the present policy to be maintained until a decision was taken about thereduction of the level of housing subsidies.The following points were raised in discussion:  (a) It was recognised that any arrangements to meet special housing problems would have to apply equally to Scotland.(b) Discussions were proceeding between the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Education about the level of school building. An increase in expenditure on school building would go some way to meet criticism of the decline in local authorities&apos; housebuilding.The Cabinet Approved the terms of the reply which the Minister of housing proposed to make to Parliamentary Questions onthis subject.Independent 4.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of television the Exchequer (CP. (55) 78) suggesting the principles which shouldAuthority. govern relations between Government Departments on the one hand(Previous and the Independent Television Authority (I.T.A.) and its programmeReference: contractors on the other, and recommending that an approach shouldC.C. (55) 15th be made to the I.T.A. companies with the object of concluding an conclusions, agreement on Government facilities for I.T.A. programmes.Minute 7.) Discussion showed that the Cabinet accepted the principle thatit would be right to start by treating the I.T.A. and its programme companies on an equal footing with the B.B.C. and cinema newsreels.On the question whether Government Departments should give facilities for the production of programmes, including the provisionof material for advertising intervals, it was pointed out that different departments might well take different lines. The service departments would be rightly reluctant to afford Service facilities for anything in the nature of advertising. At present the I.T.A. were notshowing any great interest in obtaining material from GovernmentDepartments for their programmes. The Government would on occasions be glad of publicity through the medium of television, andit would therefore be unwise to open discussions with the I.T.A. orthe programme companies by emphasing the difficulties which might arise in providing Government facilities for programmes or even foradvertising. In the first instance, it would be advisable to seek theco-operation of the IT.A.; the practical difficulties would speak for themselves.
5 CM. 24 (55)It was the general view of the Cabinet that, to ensure uniformity of practice, it would be best if applications from the I.T.A. and theprogramme companies for Government facilities were to be dealtwith through a single channel. The final decision whether facilities should be afforded might rest with the Postmaster-General.In further discussion the following points were raised:  (a) Local education authorities might be tempted to enter intoarrangements with the regional organisations of the I.T.A.,particularly in connection with schools programmes. The Ministerof Education said that he would consult with the Postmaster-general with a view to seeing if any general guidance should be issued to localeducation authorities.(b) The Postmaster-General said that any discussions designedto lead to an agreement covering the provision of Governmentfacilities should take place not only with the programme companiesbut with the I.T.A. itself. There was general agreement with thisview.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster-General to consider what arrange-ments should be made to ensure that applications by theIndependent Television Authority or programme companies for Government facilities were dealt with in a uniform manner.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1), approved CP. (55) 78 as a basis on which the Postmaster-General might arrange for discussions to begin with the Independent television authority and the programme companies.(3) Invited the Postmaster-General in due course to seek thePrime Ministers approval for the arrangements to be worked out under Conclusions (1) and (2) above, and toinform the Cabinet of the results.Charitable 5.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord PresidentTrusts. (C.P. (55) 76) covering drafts of (i) a White Paper setting out the government&apos;s policy on charitable trusts in England and Wales, and(ii) a statement of the Governments policy on amending the TrusteeList of investments.The Lord President said that the White Paper was the result of careful examination, under the supervision of the Home AffairsCommittee, of the recommendations contained in the report of LordNathan&apos;s Committee on the Law and Practices relating to CharitableTrusts (Cmd. 8710). In several respects the policy suggested in theWhite Paper departed from the recommendations of the NathanCommittee. Thus, although it could be agreed that there was room for some relaxation of the procedure for widening the range of trusteeinvestments, such as giving the Charity Commissioners and theMinistry of Education authority to grant wider powers of investmentto charitable trustees, the suggestion that there should be a generalextension of the Trustee List to include equity stocks and shares wasnot accepted. Again, the Nathan Committee recommended thatEnglish practice should be brought into line with that in Scotland, soas to give the scheme-making authorities wider powers; but the white paper took the view that the Nathan Committee had under-estimated the extent to which charitable trusts could be altered under thepresent law, and accordingly placed more emphasis on the individualresponsibility and initiative of charitable trustees. The White Paperalso proposed that the Charity Commission should be constituted ona whole-time basis with a predominantly legal composition, insteadof as a part-time body of &quot; men and women of standing in public an^
charitable affairs.&quot; The Prime Minister had approved the proposal that the Home Secretary should represent the Charity commissioners in Parliament. The White Paper also proposed that the localauthorities should play a smaller part in the administration ofcharitable trusts than the Nathan Committee had recommended.Discussion showed that the Cabinet endorsed the policy proposed in the White Paper and in the draft statement on amending the Trustee List (Appendices A and B to CP. (55) 76). It was agreedthat the White Paper should be presented to Parliament during thefollowing week, when the statement of Government policy on the trustee List could also be made, and that it would be helpful ifthe Governmenfs policy were to be fully explained at a press conference.The Cabinet (1) Approved the statements of Government policy containedin Appendices A and B to CP. (55) 76.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the lord privy Seal, to arrange for the White Paper to be published,and for the statement of policy on the Trustee List to bemade in both Houses of Parliament in the following week.Agriculture.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 80thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture (CP. (55) 77) proposing that his powers for securingreasonable standards of husbandry and estate management, and theprovisions for giving security of tenure to tenant farmers, should be reviewed by an independent committee of inquiry.The Minister of Agriculture said that some early action was desirable to resolve the unsatisfactory situation on these relatedproblems. As regards his disciplinary powers under the agriculture act, 1947, to secure reasonable standards of husbandry, guidancewould have to be given to the County Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees, if it was intended to retain them, since the Committees,were uncertain about the extent to which these statutory functions,which they were responsible for operating, should be exercised. Atpresent the disciplinary powers were very seldom used and it wasnotable that criticism of them came almost entirely from outside theindustry. Members of County Committees were themselves dividedon the desirability of retaining these powers. The Governmentwould in the end have to decide whether the powers should be.retained, and exercised in extreme cases, or whether they should begiven up. The present position could not very well be allowed tocontinue unless, as he proposed, an impartial inquiry were set up toexamine the question.As regards security of tenure, the Minister said that the existing statutory provisions made it unduly difficult to allow changes intenancy where these were desirable in the interests of efficiency.Great efforts had been made to give young men training in modernfarming methods, but it was at present virtually impossible for thesemen to obtain farms of their own. There would be wide support in the country, among landowners and in the professional bodies concerned, for an inquiry on this subject, though the national farmers&apos; Unions and the agricultural trade unions could be expectedto oppose it.In discussion the view was expressed that there were specialobjections to inviting an independent committee to review the powers for securing reasonable standards of husbandry. In practical terms the question was not whether the Government should have the disciplinary powers contained in the Agriculture Act, 1947, but whether such powers were being effectively exercised. The present unsatisfactory position arose from the fact that the powers had been
delegated to the County Committees. On the other hand, it was argued that a committee of inquiry might be able to recommendwhether the disciplinary powers were a reasonable concomitant tothe price guarantee arrangements which were also contained in the1947 Act. If the committee recommended that a case had been made out for the exercise of these powers, the Minister of Agriculture couldencourage the County Committees to use them effectively, or couldsubstitute different arrangements for the exercise of such powers.If the committee recommended that such powers were not justified,the Government would be in a stronger position to dispense withthem. Nevertheless, it should be realised that a committee mightwell fail to reach unanimous conclusions.The opinion was expressed by several Ministers that it would bebetter to increase the provision of technical advice to farmers, inorder to improve the general efficiency of the industry, and graduallyto dispense with powers of direction and compulsion. The Ministerof Agriculture undertook to consider whether such a change in thefunctions of the County Committees, and in the method of exercisinghis powers under the Agriculture Act, could be made.In their discussion of the statutory provisions for giving securityof tenure to tenant farmers the Cabinet expressed general agreementwith the view that it should be made easier for new men to enter theindustry. For this purpose, landlords would have to have power togive effective notice to quit to unsatisfactory tenants. It would,however, be difficult politically to set up a committee of inquiry forthe sole purpose of considering the security of tenure of tenantfarmers. There would be less objection if the inquiry were for thepurpose of examining how to give young farmers a better chanceof entering the industry in the interests of efficient food production.But many difficulties would remain; for example, if the committeewere to include protagonists from both sides of industry, it would be unlikely to present an agreed report. Again, any such inquiry wouldbe likely to propose an increase in the powers either of the state or of landlords.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Cabinefspreliminary discussion of the problems raised in CP. (55) 77 showed that further consideration would be necessary before a decision couldbe reached on the advisability of an inquiry, either into the disciplinary powers, or security of tenure, or both. As regards theformer, the Minister of Agriculture might consider whether, in thecourse of a review to be undertaken by his Department, in whichexpert advice from interested parties might be sought privately, thepowers could best be exercised in the future by interpreting thefunctions of County Committees as advisory rather than compulsory.The Minister would also wish to reconsider, in the light of the views expressed in discussion, the question of submitting security of tenureto an independent committee, especially if it were the only subjectto be reviewed.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture to take account of theviews expressed in discussion and to submit to the cabinet at a later date further proposals on the questions of disciplinary powers and security of tenure.7. The Cabinet again considered whether the United kingdom should now record a vote in favour of admitting Japan to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.).The Cabinet were informed that, even if Japan were to obtainsufficient votes to secure admission before we had voted, it would still be open to us to record our vote up to 11th August, and it was even possible that the time for voting might be extended.The Cabinet were also informed that it was not yet known howcertain important industrial countries (e.g., Germany and the Benelux
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,19th July, 1955.countries) would vote. It would be more difficult for us to vote infavour of Japan if these countries failed to do so. On the otherhand, New Zealand had decided to vote in favour of Japan, while atthe same time invoking Article XXXV so as to avoid undertakingG.A.T.T. obligations towards Japan.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the end, it was likely that it would be found to be in our best interests to vote for japan&apos;s admission to the G.A.T.T., but the balance of opinion wasthat a decision to do so should not be taken immediately.The Cabinet Agreed to resume consideration of this question at a futuremeeting.
