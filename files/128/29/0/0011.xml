industrial disputes.Railways.(previous reference:CM. (55) 10thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the efforts which had beenmade, after their meeting on 27th May, to avert the threatened strikeby members of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and firemen (A.S.L.E.F.). In the course of 28th May proposals had been formulated, with the assistance of the Trades Union Congress,which might have been acceptable to A.S.L.E.F.; but, late in thediscussions on that day, the National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.)had indicated that, if a settlement were reached on that basis, theywould press a claim for consequential increases in pay for all save the lowest grades of their members. The two Unions had been unwilling to contemplate a joint approach to the problem, and they were stillunwilling to enter into joint discussions with the transport commission. There had been some change in the attitude of theCommission in the last few days before the strike began. While theyhad previously been unwilling to contemplate any concession, theyhad in the final stages been ready to offer moderate increases of pay to engine drivers and firemen and to some of the senior gradesrepresented by the N.U.R. In the event, however, it had not beenpossible to reach any settlement, and the members of A.S.L.E.F. had come out on strike at midnight on 28th May.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The best chance of securing a settlement was through theappointment of a conciliation board under the Conciliation Act, 1896.Though it was undesirable in principle that negotiations should be resumed before the strikers had returned to work, there would be advantage in making it plain that the Governments offer to appointsuch a board was still open. It might even be desirable that themembers of the board should be nominated at once, so that it wouldbe evident that their services could be immediately available as soonas the strike was called off. It would not, however, be possible toproceed to the appointment of the board without the consent of theparties to the dispute.(b) In essence, though not in form, this was a dispute between twoUnions. For there could be no lasting settlement with A.S.L.E.F.which did not take into account the consequential claims which were likely to made by the N.U.R. on behalf of their members.If a satisfactory settlement was to be made, it must cover the claims of both Unions. For this reason the aim must be to induce bothUnions to enter into joint negotiations with the transport commission.(c) The public should be made av/are of the long-term economiceffects of the strike. Some of these would not be felt for some months to come. In particular, delay in building up distributed stocks of coalmight give rise to unemployment or short-time working in the coming winter.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the situation and invited the Prime Minister toconsider whether the points noted in paragraphs (a) to (c)above should be brought home to the public by officialstatements issued through the Press or by a Ministerialbroadcast.The Cabinet were informed that at a Privy Council held atBalmoral on 31st May a Proclamation of Emergency and a code ofemergency regulations had been made under the Emergency powers act, 1920. Prearranged plans for maintaining essential supplies and services had been put into operation and these had materially reduced the dislocation which the strike would otherwise have caused. in discussion of these arrangements the following points were raised:  (d) If the strike continued, some changes should be madein the arrangements for the Ascot race-meeting. It would seeminappropriate in those circumstances that The Queen should drive
in state from Windsor to the Royal Enclosure. Though it mightnot be necessary to cancel the meeting, it would be preferable that itsceremonial and social aspects should be substantially curtailed. Themeeting might well be reduced to the level of those held at Ascot inJuly and September.(e) In some parts of the country strikers were seeking other employment, and some of them were obtaining temporary insurancecards for this purpose. Though it would be unwise for theGovernment to take any action which might seem inconsistent withthe recognition of the right to strike, it might be for consideration whether strikers should be assisted to find other employment by theissue of temporary insurance cards.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Prime Minister to discuss with The Queen what changes should be made in the arrangements for the RoyalAscot Meeting if the railway strike continued.(3) Invited the Minister of National Insurance to consider, inconsultation with the Minister of Labour, whether any action could properly be taken to restrict the issue of temporary insurance cards to persons desiring to seekother employment while on strike.Industrial 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterRelations.       of Labour (CP. (55) 25) reviewing some of the suggestions which had recently been canvassed for checking unofficial strikes and for improving industrial relations generally.The Minister of Labour said that, by statements made in thecourse of the Election, the Government were committed to discussingthese problems with the Trades Union Congress and subsequentlywith the National Joint Advisory Council. Private and informal conversations were already taking place between members of theTrades Union Congress and of the British Employers&apos; Confederation,and the results of those conversations would be reported to him duringthe following week. None of the remedies which had so far beensuggested was free from difficulty. He was himself disposed to thinkthat in the first instance an enquiry should be made by an independent committee into the position of the trade unions and the existingpractices and procedures of collective bargaining.The Prime Minister suggested that discussion of this subject could conveniently be postponed so that Ministers might have further timeto study the issues raised by the Ministers memorandum.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of the issues raised in cp. (55) 25 at a meeting in the following week.\The Queen&apos;sSpeech onthe Openingof Parliament.(previous reference:CM. (55) 10thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President(CP. (55) 24) covering a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Openingof Parliament.The following points were raised in discussion of this draft:  (a) A paragraph should be added to the Speech to acquaintParliament of the fact that a state of emergency had been proclaimedunder the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, to deal with the situation arising from the strike on the railways.  The Cabinet agreed that a
paragraph should be inserted at the beginning of the Speech in thefollowing terms:  &quot; Because of the grave situation created by the interruption of the railway services it has been necessary to advance the dateof the Opening of Parliament. I have proclaimed a state ofemergency under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, to enableMy Ministers to take the necessary steps to maintain supplies and services which are essential to the life of the community.&quot;They also agreed that this paragraph should be followed by the passages in the draft dealing with foreign affairs, viz., paragraphs 5-10.(b) It was suggested that the Speech should contain some reference to the Governments intention to take action to deal with thegeneral problem of strikes. The Cabinet agreed that paragraph 14of the draft should be amended to read as follows:  &quot; The full employment of My People will continue to be thefirst care of My Ministers. To this end they will actively seek theco-operation of employers and workers in ensuring that employment and output shall not be jeopardised by industrial disputes. They are convinced that, with a steady expansion ofproduction in industry, commerce and agriculture, an ever higher standard of living can be secured for the whole nation.&quot;They further agreed that paragraph 14, amended on these lines,would be better followed by paragraphs 1.7, 16 and 15 in that order.(c) It was agreed that paragraph 15 should be amended to read as follows:  &quot; My Government will take such further action as may berequired in the public interest to deal with abuses in the field ofmonopolies and restrictive practices.&quot;(d) It was agreed that an additional paragraph on the modernisation and re-equipment of the railways should be insertedbetween paragraphs 22 and 23. The Minister of Transport was invited to submit a draft for this purpose.(e) It was agreed that the sentence in square brackets inparagraph 26 of the draft should be included in the Speech, subjectto the omission of the word &quot; will&quot;. The Minister of Educationconfirmed that the reference in this paragraph to the &quot; needs &quot; of teachers was intended to cover mainly their need for the necessary equipment to enable them to carry out their duties satisfactorily.(/) The Lord Privy Seal said that paragraph 31 of the draft Speechcontemplated a single comprehensive Copyright Bill: this wouldobviate the need to reintroduce the Copyright and TelevisionExhibiting Rights Bill which had not been passed in the last session.It must not be assumed, however, that such a major measure couldbe carried through all its stages in both Houses before July 1956.(g) The Minister of Housing and Local Government pressed forthe inclusion in the Speech of a specific reference to the governments intention to introduce a Clean Air Bill in the forthcoming session.Had it not been for the Dissolution of the last Parliament, theGovernment would have been obliged to introduce a Clean Air Billin the late session, which they had undertaken to do in order tosecure the withdrawal of a Private Member&apos;s Bill on the subject. Ifthe matter were not now mentioned in The Queen&apos;s Speech, theGovernment would be pressed to declare their intentions in the matterand would be obliged to promise a Bill.The Lord President said that The Queen&apos;s Speech Committee hadtaken the view that uncertainty about the practicability of a soundscheme for promoting clean air-and, in particular, about the availability of supplies of smokeless fuels made it undesirable togive a specific promise of early legislation.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he was fully satisfiedthat adequate supplies of smokeless fuel would in fact be available.
\Legislative 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordProgramme:     Privy Seal (CP. (55) 23) covering a list of the Bills proposed as1955-56 Session, the principal constituents of the legislative programme for theforthcoming session.The Lord Privy Seal said that the main purpose of his memorandum was to provide a background for the cabinets discussion of the draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech. The accompanyinglist of Bills, which had been drawn up by the Future legislation committee, was not intended to be exhaustive, and the many lessermeasures which Departments had proposed would need to beconsidered by the Committee before a complete programme could besubmitted for the Cabinefs approval. It would, however, be convenient if the Cabinet would authorise the immediate reintro-duction of the nine Bills introduced but not passed in the last session,namely, those set out under Item 1 in the Annex to his memorandum.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Bills set out in the list contained in the annex to CP. (55) 23 should form the main constituents ofthe legislative programme for the 1955-56 session.(2) Authorised the immediate reintroduction into Parliament ofof the nine Bills set out under Item 1 in that list.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to submit recommendations onthe question whether legislation should be introduced inthe coming session on the subject of registers ofParliamentary electors and redistribution of seats.Kenya.SurrenderOffer.(previous reference:CM. (55) 10thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the colonial secretary (CP. (55) 22) proposing that a limit should now be set tothe period during which the current surrender offer to the remainingMau Mau terrorists should remain in force, and recommending theimposition of severer disabilities on those terrorists who failed to surrender.The Colonial Secretary said that little hope now remained of amass surrender of terrorists under the current surrender offer, andthe Council of Ministers in Kenya had decided that the time hadThe Cabinet agreed that a paragraph on this subject should beincluded in the Speech in the following terms:  &quot; Legislation will be introduced to reduce the pollution ofthe air by smoke and from other causes.&quot;In the course of the Cabinefs discussion various detailedamendments of the draft Speech were also suggested and adopted.The Cabinet (1) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to prepare a revised version of the draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Openingof Parliament annexed to OP. (55) 24, incorporating the amendments noted above and the drafting amendmentsapproved in the course of the discussion.(2) Authorised the Prime Minister, in consultation with the lord president, to settle the final text of the draft Speech and tosubmit it for The Queen&apos;s approval.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to report on thepresent position in regard to monopolies and restrictive practices, and to recommend the lines on which the matter could best be handled during the forthcoming debate onthe Address.
come to announce that the offer would remain open for only six weeksmore. There was evidence of a split among the terrorists and, inorder to exploit this and to reinforce the effect of the surrender offerwhile it remained open, the Governor had recommended, with the unanimous support of all responsible elements in the Colony, that itshould be announced that those terrorists who failed to take advantageof the offer would be subjected to more severe penalties. In particular,it was proposed that the provisions for the forfeiture of terrorists&apos;land should be extended. Under the existing Forfeiture of LandOrdinance of 1953 terrorists who had been convicted and sentencedand known terrorists who were still at large might be deprived ofland which they held in the native, reserves. It was now proposedthat these provisions should be extended so that (i) the particular landaffected need not in future be specified at the time of the making ofa forfeiture Order; and (ii) terrorists who failed to surrender shouldbe disqualified from the capacity to hold any land in the future.The Colonial Secretary said that the Government of Kenya hadbeen anxious to go even further in the direction of a declaration ofoutlawry, but he had not been satisfied that measures of that degreeof severity would be justified. He had discussed the proposals in cp. (55) 22 with the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General and,in order to meet their views, had asked the Governor to provide thatthe Advisory Committee, which was to be established to advise himon objections lodged by those affected by disqualification orders,should be empowered to publish its recommendations. If theGovernment of Kenya were not authorised to make any increasewhatever in the severity of existing penalties, there was a serious risk that some of the European members of the Legislative Council wouldresign their appointments.In discussion grave doubts were expressed both on the proprietyand on the probable effectiveness of the proposed new disabilities.These were likely to incur serious criticism in Parliament, and if, as aresult, it should be found necessary to modify them, the effect in kenya was likely to be even more unfortunate than if they had never been introduced at all. It seemed doubtful in any case whether the terrorists would believe that, if such severe disabilities were imposed,they would not be rescinded at a later date. The Cabinet were informed in this connection that it was open to the Governor torescind forfeitures under the existing Ordinance in cases whereindividuals affected established a claim to more favourable treatmentby their subsequent conduct. There was also the objection that settlement on the land was normally the most effective means ofreforming former terrorists and that wholesale disqualification ofterrorists from the capacity to hold land in future would be likelyto prejudice the use of land settlement for this purpose. Thesuggestion was made that the proposed disqualification might belimited to a fixed period of years, although the threat of only a limiteddisqualification would clearly be less effective as an inducement to surrender. It was also suggested that there would be less objectionto extending the scope of provisions for the forfeiture of existing rights in land than to the introduction of a disqualification from the capacity to hold land, whether this was of definite or indefinite duration.The following further points were made in discussion:  (a) The Lord Chancellor said that he had been given tounderstand that the present attitude of the terrorists was such that theimposition of the proposed severer penalties might well have the effectof inducing surrenders on a decisive scale. He had made it clearthat he could only reconcile the proposed disabilities with theConvention on Human Rights on the assumption that the alternative to their imposition was the imposition of the death penalty.The Colonial Secretary said that this condition would not be fulfilled in all cases, as the death penalty could only be imposed wherea conviction for a specific offence could be obtained.
(b) It would be important to make it clear that forfeited land would not be made available for the use of Europeans but would beheld by the Crown for the benefit of other Africans.The Colonial Secretary said that it was evident from thediscussion that the Cabinet were reluctant to approve the proposals in his memorandum. He would, therefore, inform the Governor of kenya at once of the doubts which had been expressed about them,and would seek his views on the more limited proposals for extending the provisions for forfeiture put forward in the Cabinefs discussion.He would at the same time make it clear to the Governor that it was open to him to announce forthwith a time-limit after which thecurrent surrender offer should be withdrawn, although he doubted whether the Governor would wish to take this action until it was clear whether he would ultimately secure authority to announceincreased penalties for terrorists who failed to surrender by theprescribed date.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to consult further with theGovernor of Kenya on the possibility of devising sanctionsless drastic than those outlined in CP. (55) 22 for inducingMau Mau terrorists to surrender before the expiration ofthe current surrender offer.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd June, 1955.
