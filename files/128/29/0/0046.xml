Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that theprogress of the Committee Stage of the Housing Subsidies Bill had so far been very slow. It was possible that many of the amendmentstabled by the Opposition were out of order, but there was no prospect that there would be a ruling to that effect.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the best coursewould be for the Minister of Housing to discuss with opposition leaders, in the light of progress made with the Bill that day, how many more days might be required to complete the committee stage. If, as was likely, it proved impossible to come to a firmunderstanding with the Opposition on this question, it would benecessary to consider the imposition of a time-table to cover all theremaining stages of the Bill. If it were decided that this should bedone, a Government motion for this purpose could be introducedimmediately after the Christmas recess.Teachers&apos;Superannuation,(previous reference:CM. (55) 38thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Cabinet reviewed the Parliamentary prospects of the teachers&apos; (Superannuation) Bill. They recognised that the Billoffered ample opportunity for protracted debate, particularly sincethe provisions relating to England and Wales were separate fromthose applying to Scotland.The Minister of Education said that the resistance of the teaching profession to the superannuation proposals had beenunder-estimated, and it was now being carried to the length ofobstructing the Bill. This opposition was really symptomatic ofthe profession^ belief that there had been a substantial decline intheir relative living standards, and was being maintained despite the burnham Committee offer of a 5 per cent, salary increase to take effect from 1st April, 1956. It was likely that this offer would be rejected and that the teachers&apos; representatives would press for amore thorough revision of salaries at an early date. Neither the teachers nor their representatives were, however, united in supportof a policy of non-co-operation in such matters as the collection ofNational Savings.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the Governmentshould adhere to the policy contained in the Teachers&apos;(Superannuation) Bill.Nuclear 3.   The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister hadWeapons.        taken the view that there might be advantage in tabling a Govern-previous        ment amendment to the Opposition motion proposing that HerReference:      Majesty&apos;s Government should approach the United States and cm. (55) 45th   Soviet Governments with a view to concluding an agreement for conclusions,    the discontinuance of further experimental explosions of hydrogenMinute 2.)       bombs.   An amendment had been drafted which stressed theimportance of the nuclear deterrent in preventing aggression and made it clear that any discussions with other Governments wouldhave to take account of the number and nature of the experimentalexplosions made or envisaged.   The Minister of Defence said thathe had proposed certain alterations to that draft.It was suggested in discussion that, as it had now been announced that the Prime Minister would shortly visit the UnitedStates, and as it was likely that his discussions with president eisenhower would include the subject of nuclear explosions, therewas no great advantage in tabling a Government amendment.
The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Minister of Defence, to submit thedraft of an amendment to the Opposition motion to thePrime Minister for his consideration, and, if the PrimeMinister thought that such an amendment should betabled, to circulate it for consideration by the Cabinet.Heroin. 4.   The Lord President said that, in view of the legal argument(Previous        that had been pressed in the debate in the House of Lords on the reference:      previous day that the powers provided in the Dangerous Drugs Act,CM. (55) 44th   195.1, could not properly be used to ban outright the manufactureConclusions,     of a drug, the Government had felt obliged to announce that the minute 4.)       manufacture of heroin would be licensed for a further year, duringwhich Parliament would have time to consider the matter further.The Home Secretary would now circulate to the Cabinet a further memorandum on the subject in the light of &quot;this development.   Itwas, however, clear that any proposal at the present time to seeklegislative authority for the ban would be defeated in the Houseof Lords, where the opposition to it was overwhelming.The Cabinet agreed that, as it had been necessary to make an important statement of Government policy on this subject inthe House of Lords on the previous day, it would be desirable thatthe Home Secretary should make an announcement in similar terms in the House of Commons on the following day.Road Haulage        5.   The Cabinet were informed that, so far as could beDisposals Bill,   determined, a substantial measure of success had been achieved at(Previous        the meeting which had taken place with Government supporters on reference:       8th December in dispelling the anxiety which had arisen over the cm. (55) 45th   Government^  proposals  relating  to  the  trunk  road  services.Conclusions,    Although a small number of Conservative Members had remainedMinute 4.)       unconvinced by the explanations which had been given them, therewas evidence at the meeting that Government supporters in generalnow understood the force of the considerations which had weighedwith the Government in formulating the proposals which wouldbe embodied in the Road Haulage Disposals Bill.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Transport to introduce theRoad Haulage Disposals Bill in the House of commons on the following day.Parliament: 6.   The Lord President reported to the Cabinet that in theJoint Select further consultations which had taken place, the Labour OppositionCommittees. had remained unwilling to agree to the appointment of a JointNaval Discipline Select Committee of both Houses for the examination of the NavalAct. Discipline Act, in spite of the offer which he had made, as on(Previous        previous similar occasions, to meet their views on the compositionReference-       anc* ^e chairmanship of the Committee.   It was, in his opinion,CM (55)40th   cloar that the Labour Opposition were deliberately refusing to conclusions,     operate a constitutional practice which was both of long standingMinute 4.) &apos;     anc* particularly appropriate for cases of this kind.  He felt that, asthe Government had a satisfactory majority in the House ofCommons, consideration should now be given to challenging theOpposition on this issue.   There appeared to be no satisfactorycompromise course.  If each House of Parliament were to appointits own Select Committee the Government might be faced with a difficult responsibility for adjudicating between conflicting reports.
5 CM. 46 (55)If it were arranged that the Select Committee appointed by theHouse of Commons should report first, the Committee appointedby the House of Lords would have to weigh the necessity of reportingin the same sense. He foresaw, if matters went unchecked, a situation developing in which the House of Lords would be unableto co-operate in Joint Select Committees, but would at the sametime feel debarred from appointing Select Committees of their own.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he shared theLord Presidents apprehensions about the difficulties which would arise if each House appointed its own Select Committee. He hopedthat, in view of the legal and naval experience available in the Houseof Lords, it might still be possible to overcome the obstacles whichstood in the way of appointing a Joint Select Committee.(h) The view was expressed that the resistance of the labour opposition to this proposal might not be wholly attributable toobjections of principle. It was reported that they were concerned at the strength of their representation in the House of Lords and,in spite of the presence in that House of three former Labour FirstLords of the Admiralty, took the view that they would be unableto muster a sufficient number of energetic and experienced Peersto represent them on a Joint Select Committee.(c) There might be little advantage in openly challenging theOpposition on this matter; for, if the Government were to force the appointment of a Joint Select Committee, the Opposition mightrefuse to nominate members to serve on it.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, as there was clearly a risk of an important constitutional practice falling into abeyance,a further attempt should be made to persuade the Leader of theLabour Opposition in the House of Lords to induce his Party toagree to the appointment of a Joint Select Committee.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President to approach the Leader of theLabour Opposition in the House of Lords in a further attempt to persuade the Labour Opposition to agree to theappointment of a Joint Select Committee on the naval discipline Act.White Fish 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSubsidy. Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture(CP. (55) 200) seeking guidance on the question whether theStatutory Order which had been laid before Parliament prescribingthe rates of white fish subsidy for the period beginning 1st January,1956, should be amended so as to reduce the cut which it had proposed to make in the subsidy payable to the inshore fishing fleet.The Minister of Agriculture said that the white fish subsidy was intended to be a temporary measure while the fishing industry wasbeing modernised. It was not yet clear whether the subsidy couldbe withdrawn by 31st March, 1958, which was the date whenauthority for the payment of subsidy under the White Fish andHerring Industries Act of 1953 would come to an end, but therewould be no prospect of withdrawing the subsidy by that date if,in the meantime, no steps had been taken gradually to reduce it.The subsidy changes proposed in the Order which had already been laid before Parliament did not represent a net reduction in the totalsubsidy, since the cuts in some rates were offset by increases in others in order to meet the higher cost of the coal used by steamtrawlers. All sections of the fishing industry claimed that thereshould be increases in their rates of subsidy to meet higher costs,and the cuts which had been proposed had met with strongeropposition than had been envisaged.   There had been strong
criticism, particularly from certain Government supporters inParliament, of the proposed reduction in the subsidy for the inshorefleets of Ad. per stone of white fish landed. This amounted to a cut of 40 per cent., compared with one of 15 per cent, proposedin the subsidy for the near and middle water fleets. Whereas thecase for the latter cut could be justified on the basis of knownoperating data, the level of operating costs and profits, which variedwidely, could not easily be established in the case of the inshorefleets.The Minister of Agriculture therefore favoured reducing theproposed cut in the inshore subsidy from Ad. to 2d. This concession would undoubtedly lead to demands from other sections of theindustry for a reduction in the cuts proposed for them Scottishsteam trawler owners would, for example, expect a comparableconcession. Such demands could be resisted on the ground that the cut in the subsidy for the inshore fleet would still be larger thanthe cut applied to the near and middle water fleets. The concessionhe now proposed would cost about  120,000 in a full year.The Cabinet were informed that there was a real danger thatthe Order as at present laid would not secure the approval ofParliament. The Opposition were virtually certain to vote against it, and a number of Government supporters might feel bound todo likewise, or to abstain from voting.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat it would be easier to justify the proposed subsidy changes as awhole if the severe cut in the subsidy for the inshore fleet were reduced as proposed by the Minister of Agriculture. If the Orderwere so amended, it was not likely that more than a very fewGovernment supporters would oppose it.For this purpose it would be necessary to present an amendedOrder to the Special Orders Committee of the House of Lords that afternoon. It was therefore desirable that an announcement shouldbe made as soon as possible in the House of Commons that theGovernment had decided to reduce the cut originally proposed inthe subsidy for the inshore fleet and to lay a new Order for thatpurpose.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the proposed cut in the inshore subsidy shouldbe reduced from Ad. to 2d. a stone.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to make a statement inParliament that afternoon to explain the government&apos;s decision to lay an amended Order before Parliament togive effect to the decision recorded in Conclusion (1)above.Malta. 8.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Chancellor(Previous (CP. (55) 194) covering a proof of the Report of the Round TableReference:       Conference on Malta.CM. (55) 31st The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister had agreed conclusions,     that the Report should be laid before Parliament on 16th December,Minute 1.)       and that it should be published simultaneously in London and Maltaat 3 p.m. the same day.It had also been suggested that the Prime Minister should makea statement in Parliament on 15th December announcing that theReport would be published on the following day, thanking the LordChancellor and the members of the Conference for their work, andundertaking that the Government would not take action on thereport until Parliament had had an opportunity of debating it afterthe Christmas recess. There was general agreement that the report was of such importance as to make such a statement desirable, andthe Cabinet agreed the terms of a draft statement for the approvalof the Prime Minister.
Monopolies andRestrictivePractices.(previous reference:CM. (55) 40thConclusions,Minute 2.)9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (55) 196) setting out two major issues on which theCommittee of Ministers on the Monopolies Commission Reportneeded a decision in order to proceed with the preparation oflegislation to implement the Governmenfs policy on restrictive practices.The Lord Chancellor recalled that in July the Cabinet, following a course which was a compromise between the majority and minorityrecommendations of the Report of the Monopolies Commission, had decided that legislation should be introduced which would requirerestrictive practices to be registered and to be subject to case-by-caseexamination by a tribunal. The onus of proof that these practiceswere not contrary to the public interest was to be placed on theindustrialists concerned. The Government had announced their intention of introducing legislation during the current session to giveeffect to this policy. The Committee of Ministers which, under his chairmanship, had been considering the main lines of the legislation which would be required had reached a point where it had become necessary to seek a decision of the. Cabinet on two major matters,viz.: (i) the criteria by which restrictive practices were to be judged;and (ii) the nature of the tribunal to which the jurisdiction would beentrusted.On the first of these questions &quot; the justiciable issue &quot; theCommittee had arrived at a set of criteria which would require anindustrialist to prove before the tribunal that a particular restrictivepractice had some positive merit, in accordance with the definitionsIt was also agreed that the Cabinet, at their next meeting, shouldhave a preliminary discussion of the recommendations contained inthe Report, and that these should then be considered in greater detail by a Committee of Ministers.The Colonial Secretary said that the Prime Minister of Maltahad asked for a copy of the Report in advance of publication, toenable him to introduce a Bill in the Maltese Parliament on16th December (the day when the Report was to be published) toprovide for a referendum in Malta on the question of representation in the United Kingdom Parliament. The Prime Minister of Malta,because of certain difficulties with which he was faced in arranginghis legislative time-table, was anxious to introduce this Bill as soonas possible so that a referendum could be held without delay.The Colonial Secretary said that he proposed to refuse this request and to point out to the Prime Minister of Malta that itwould be unwise to introduce such a Bill immediately, or to holda referendum before the United Kingdom Parliament had had anopportunity of considering the Report. To do so would appear tobe an attempt to influence the views of the United kingdom parliament and to prejudge the formulation of the United kingdom governments policy.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to make a statement inParliament on 15th December on the lines agreed intheir discussion.(2) Agreed that the Colonial Secretary should refuse the requestof the Prime Minister of Malta for a copy of the Reportin advance of publication, and should discourage his proposal to introduce a referendum Bill immediately.(3) Agreed to give preliminary consideration to the conclusionsof the Report at their next meeting, with a view to more detailed examination of the Report being undertakenthereafter by a Committee of Ministers.
set out in Annex I to CP. (55) 196. The question on which theCommittee had not been able to agree was whether the conditions set out in paragraph (c) of Annex I, which provided for a plea in defence of a restrictive practice that its removal would lead to substantial unemployment in the industry or to substantial damage to the nation&apos;s export trade and the earnings from it, should bedrawn, as had been suggested by the Attorney-General, in somewhatwider terms which would permit the industrialist to plead other formsof injury. An alternative version drafted in this sense was set outin paragraph 8 of CP. (55) 196.On the second major point the Committee, in considering three possible forms of tribunal, were unanimous in agreeing that, for thereasons given in CP. (55) 196, the High Court itself would not be suitable. The function of the High Court was to decide questionsof fact and law and it was not equipped to exercise the degree ofeconomic judgment which would be involved in adjudicating upon these cases, however narrowly the justiciable issue might be drawn.There remained the alternatives of an administrative tribunalresponsible to a Minister, or an independent judicial tribunal. a tribunal of the latter type, following closely the precedent establishedby the Railway and Canal Commission, would take the form of a statutory court under the jurisdiction of a High Court Judge whowould be assisted by laymen expert in economic matters, and wouldsit in divisions in order to dispose of the volume of work that mightbe expected to arise. There would be an appeal from it on a pointof law to the Court of Appeal and possibly to the House of Lords.All the Heads of the Judiciary in the United Kingdom had been consulted informally and had agreed that a tribunal analogous to theRailway and Canal Commission might properly be given jurisdiction of the kind which was under consideration.The Committee had been divided on which of these alternative forms of tribunal should be adopted. It had been argued, on the onehand, that the Government ought not to transfer to an independentjudicial tribunal the responsibility for taking decisions which mightprofoundly affect the economic life of the country and were thereforeessentially political in character. On the other hand it had beencontended that it would be impracticable for any Minister, even withthe assistance of his colleagues, to deal with the great number of cases which an administrative tribunal (which would also have to sit indivisions) could be expected to refer to him.The Cabinet first considered the question of the justiciable issue.The Attorney-General said that the effect of the limitations imposed by paragraph (c) of Annex I, which would require thedefence to demonstrate that the removal of a restrictive practicewould cause either substantial unemployment or damage to theexport trade, would at once outlaw a great number of agreementswithout providing an opportunity for cases on their behalf to be taken before the tribunal. Some trades would be able to prove that theremoval of a restrictive practice would result in substantial injury,without being able to adduce either the prospect of substantialunemployment or loss of exports. He did not think that the termsof the definition should be drawn so narrowly as to eliminate fromenquiry many cases in which injury of some kind could be shown.It was for this reason that he advocated, as an alternative to paragraph (c), a definition which, in more general terms, wouldrequire an industry to demonstrate that the removal of a restrictivepractice would cause greater detriment to the public than themaintenance of the practice. It would not be a question, under sucha definition, of an industry being able simply to demonstrate an injuryin the shape of a loss of profits if a restrictive practice were broughtto an end; it would be necessary to show that the injury caused tothe industry was detrimental to the public interest generally. It was,in his opinion, right that the tribunal should consider all such cases and be responsible for assessing the balance of advantage.  By way
of example, a number of practices which had been the subject of criticism by the Monopolies Commission in their recent report onthe tyre industry would, under the definition set out in Annex I, standcondemned without opportunity for enquiry. It would be impracticable in his opinion to approach the matter by attempting to include in paragraph (c), in addition to references to unemployment and the export trade, a complete list of sperfir consequences of thiskind that might be pleaded, for the list could be cApanded indefinitely.The President of the Board of Trade said that in his view the definition must be drawn in as precise terms as possible. There wasa danger that, if a tribunal were required to work on a definitiondrawn in the more general terms proposed by the Attorney-General,which corresponded broadly to those on which the monopolies commission now operated, a very large number of restrictive practices would satisfy the conditions, and the Government would beplaced in the anomalous position of being held responsible for organising their survival. If, after experience, it became clear thata definition had been drawn too precisely, it would not be difficult forits terms to be relaxed. If the definition were drawn so as to providescope for every argument in favour of a restrictive practice there wasa risk that all such practices would succeed in satisfying the conditions.The Minister of Labour said that he shared the view that itwould be dangerous to frame the definition of the justiciable issuetoo imprecisely. But further consideration should also be given tothe terms of paragraph (c), for the reference to unemployment, as atpresent drafted, might be used to support a claim that the workersin an industry had a right to continue to be employed in it,irrespective of the circumstances. It was important that theGovernment should not give inadvertent encouragement to theimmobility of labour.The Cabinet, after further discussion, were inclined to the viewthat it would probably be necessary for the justiciable issue to be defined with some precision in order to avoid the risk of opening the door too wide. A definition which depended in any sense on sucha phrase as &quot; injury to the industry &quot; would, in this respect, be dangerous. On the other hand, the terms of the draft set out in annex I would require further consideration, particularly the references to unemployment and to exports. Moreover, the questionof the justiciable issue was bound up with the form of the tribunal.And there remained the difficulty that the jurisdiction of thetribunal would involve the exercise of so much economic judgmentthat no definition might be entirely satisfactory.The Cabinet next considered the question of the form of thetribunal.  On this, the following points were made:  (a) The Lord Chancellor said that an independent judicialtribunal sitting under a High Court Judge supported by lay members would combine the prestige and weight of the High Court witheconomic knowledge. From a more general point of view, therewould be some advantage in encouraging the view that it was a function of the judiciary in a modern State to make its contributionto the settlement of economic problems of this kind. Lawyers of sufficient standing would not, however, be found willing to act aschairmen of a number of purely administrative tribunals for thispurpose.(b) The President of the Board of Trade said that industry wasunited in support of a judicial, in preference to an administrative,tribunal. The point was also made that the lay experts who wouldbe needed would be reluctant to become members of a tribunalunless it were presided over by a High Court Judge.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while accepting theforce of these arguments, the Government would in practice find it
10impossible to withdraw entirely from these matters merely bytransferring the responsibility to an independent judicial tribunal.He wondered, therefore, whether it might not be possible forprovision to be made for the justiciable issue to be re-examined bythe Government from time to time. He suggested that theCommittee of Ministers might give further thought to the question ofthe justiciable issue in the light of the various points made in the cabinet&apos;s discussion and having in mind an independent judicialtribunal rather than an administrative tribunal.The Cabinet Invited the Committee of Ministers, under the lord chancellor&apos;s Chairmanship, with the addition of theMinister of Labour, to reconsider the question of thejusticiable issue in the light of their discussion and inrelation to the appointment of an independent judicialtribunal, and to report back to the Cabinet.Bechuanaland 10.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the protectorate. Commonwealth Secretary (CP. (55) 190) recommending that, despite(Previous some recent indications of unrest in the Bamangwato Reserve, the reference: Government should continue with their present policy of supportingCM. (55) 30th Rasebolai as Acting Native Authority, in the hope that the tribeConclusions, would eventually come to accept him as their Chief.Minute 8.) The memorandum pointed out that there could be no questionof the return of Seretse Khama as Chief, since his wife and children would not be acceptable to an important section of the tribe andopinion elsewhere in the High Commission Territories would be against it. Moreover, his return would be a reversal of policy, andthis would be damaging to the Governmenfs authority in other colonial territories. On the other hand, the Government could not agree to the abolition of the Chieftainship, since this was thought tobe essential in the present stage of tribal development and there wasno other satisfactory candidate.Discussion showed that the Cabinet agreed with the policy recommended in CP. (55) 190.The Cabinet -Agreed that the Commonwealth Secretary should continuethe policy of giving all possible support to Rasebolai asActing Native Authority, and of dealing firmly with anyattempts to cause trouble in the Bamangwato Reserve.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14th December, 1955.
