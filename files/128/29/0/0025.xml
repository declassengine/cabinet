Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.It was possible that time might have to be found for a debate onthe results of the Four-Power Talks, and also for discussion of theeconomic situation. It was agreed that it would be best if thestatement which the Chancellor of the Exchequer was to make onthe latter subject could be made on 25th July, so that it could be debated, if necessary, on 26th July. If a debate were needed on theFour-Power Talks, it could take place on 27th July.Four-power talks.(previous reference:CM. (55) 23rdConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet ofthe report he had received from the Prime Minister about the meetingof Heads of Government in Geneva.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor Of the Exchequer to express to thePrime Minister their appreciation of his efforts in Geneva.Malta. 3.   The Cabinet were informed that the Colonial Secretary had(Previous submitted for the Prime Minister^ approval the suggested terms ofReference: reference for the Round Table Conference which was to consider the cm. (55) 20th implications of the proposals for closer association between MaltaConclusions, and the United Kingdom. The Cabinet were also informed that the minute 5.) Lord Privy Seal was seeking the approval of the Prime Minister forthe composition of the United Kingdom delegation to the Conference.The Cabinet considered what further steps could now be taken towards convening the Conference, and agreed that the Lord privy seal should inform the Leaders of the Opposition Parties of theproposed terms of reference, making it clear that these were stillsubject to approval by the Prime Minister. He should also inform them that the Prime Minister had invited the Lord Chancellor to preside at the Conference. When the Prime Minister had approved the terms of reference and the composition of the Conference, theGovernment Whips could informally approach the government supporters who had been suggested as suitable members of theConference, although formal invitations would be issued to them bythe Prime Minister after his return.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to inform the Leaders of opposition Parties of the proposed terms of reference of the round Table Conference on Malta, emphasising thatthese were subject to approval by the Prime Minister, andalso to inform them that the Prime Minister had invited theLord Chancellor to preside over the Conference.Steel Prices. 4.   The President of the Board of Trade said that the Chairman(Previous        of the Iron and Steel Board proposed to announce on the followingReference:      day a rise in the prices of iron and steel amounting on the average to. (53) llth   about  2 per ton, or some 5 per cent, on present prices.   About halfConclusions,    of this increase was attributable to the recent increase in the price of minute 6.)       coal, a quarter to a rise in the price of imported ore, and the balanceto increased wages and transport costs.   This announcement would arouse criticism, particularly in view of the profits shown by the steel companies and the rise which had taken place in their sharequotations since de-nationalisation.   Nevertheless, United Kingdom48552-1 B 2
steel remained among the cheapest in the world, and he felt that itwould be wrong to attempt to depress the price artificially below its economic level.In discussion the Cabinet agreed that, although in the last resortthe Government had the power to give directions to the Iron and steel board on their price policy, it would be wrong to exercise this power in any but the most exceptional circumstances.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the President of the Boardof Trade.Reimiuneratiomof Ministers.(previous reference:CM. (55) 24thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it had not so far been possible to begin taking informal soundings of Leaders of theOpposition Parties about proposals affecting the remuneration ofMinisters. On reflection, he was inclined to think that any suchapproach should be deferred until the Prime Minister had had anopportunity of considering the whole question further.The Cabinet Agreed that no approach on the question of the remunera-tion of Ministers should be made to Opposition Leadersuntil the matter had been considered further by the PrimeMinister.EconomicSituation.(previous reference:CM. (55) 22ndConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP. (55) 85) proposing thathire-purchase facilities should be further restricted by raising theminimum deposit from 15 per cent, to 33% per cent, in the case ofcertain domestic appliances and durable consumer gooas.The President of the Board of Trade said that his proposals to restrict hire-purchase on radio and television sets and gramophones,on domestic appliances such as gas and electric fires, washingmachines, vacuum cleaners and refrigerators, and on cars and motorcycles, &amp;c, could only be justified if they formed part of compre-hensive measures for restricting credit and restraining expenditure.It had to be recognised that restrictions on hire-purchase affected acomparatively small proportion of total demand; outstandinghire-purchase credit amounted to about  400 millions, which wassmall compared with total consumer expenditure of about  12,000millions a year.The additional hire-purchase restrictions would inevitably arousecriticism, particularly in the case of certain of the domestic appliances.He had considered whether an even higher rate of initial deposit, suchas 40 per cent., might be justified on cars; but, since most hire-purchase car transactions related to secondhand cars, and since therestrictions would extend to motor-cycles and power-assisted cycles,he recommended that the minimum deposit should be 33  per cent,as for the other goods in question. He understood that the Chancellorof the Exchequer was prepared to announce such a comprehensivepolicy, and the necessary Orders restricting hire-purchase would come into operation on the day following the announcement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer then outlined the statement which he proposed to make to Parliament in the following week.He proposed to point out that it was necessary to make up thebacklog due to the strikes, and to warn the country that the strain on the gold and dollar reserves was continuing. It was accordinglynecessary to limit home demand and to free resources for exports.
Credit restrictions must therefore be tightened, and he proposed inconsultation with the Governor of the Bank of England to do this by further restricting&apos; Bank advances and by reducing hire-purchasefacilities. He would make it clear that the restraint on expenditure would also be made to apply equally to the public sector, and thatthe capital programmes of the nationalised industries and expenditure  by local authorities would not be exempt.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he did not propose to abolish the bread subsidy at present but would consider this measurelater in the year, possibly in combination with some adjustment ofthe milk subsidy. He was also advised that the policy of creditrestriction could best be implemented in present circumstances by restricting Bank advances rather than by a further adjustment in bank rate. He was disposed not to prescribe precise liquidity ratiorequirements for the Clearing Banks, since that might set an undesirable precedent.The following points were raised in discussion:  (a) It was suggested that the measures outlined were perhapsless severe than was required. The hire-purchase restrictions wouldseem to.be the only positive action taken and this, while politicallycontroversial, was relatively unimportant from&apos;an economic point ofview. If was necessary for the Government to set an example to industry by reducing public expenditure, even if this meantpostponing desirable development.(b) The additional hire-purchase restrictions might lead to someunemployment, which would first be felt in development areas wherealternative employment might be hard to find.(c) It would help if the statement of policy showed that theGovernment appreciated the need to make saving, particularly bysmall savers, more attractive. People were losing the habit of savingbecause of the continual fall in the value of money.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that examinationsuggested (hat the Stock Exchange boom was not attributable, in any considerable degree, to speculation. It would, therefore, be unwise to introduce specific measures, such as shortening the period of settlement of accounts, in an attempt to curb investment in stocks and shares.The Cabinet (I) Approved the comprehensive measures to meet the economicsituation outlined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(2) Approved the additional restrictions on hire-purchasingfacilities set out in CP. (55) 85.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would take into account points raised in the Cabinefs discussion,and would circulate to the Ministers concerned thestatement on (he economic situation which he proposedto make in Parliament in the following week.

Malaya. 8.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaiy of(Previous State for the Colonies (CP. (55) 81) seeking approval for the basisReference: on which the Colonial Secretary should begin to discuss with theC.C. (54) 29th Rulers of the Malay States a revision of the present arrangementsConclusions, governing the constitutional position of Malaya.Minute 7.) 77?e Colonial Secretary said that there were a number of fundamental points on which he proposed to have preliminary discussions with the Rulers of the Malay States and leaders of political opinion in the Federation, in the course of his forthcoming tour. Thepoints on which it was essential for the United Kingdom to keep theinitiative in the development of plans for self-Government in Malayawere:  (i) the United Kingdom Governments responsibility for thedefence of Malaya;(ii) the maintenance of internal security in the Federation;(iii) reconsideration of the financial arrangements with theFederation;(iv) the relationship of the United Kingdom Government to theFederation;(v) the question of a Malayan nationality, and(vi) the question of setting up a Constitutional Commission.In discussion, the following points were raised:  (a) Malaya was relatively prosperous at present and it should bemade clear to its people that, if their aim was full self-Government,they must as a corollary make every effort to pay their own way. If,as seemed likely, we were to be obliged to provide them with considerable financial assistance for a long period, we should endeavour to ensure that the future security of our commercial interests in Malaya was safeguarded. Our financial stake in theFederation was one of the buttresses of the sterling area.(/;) Jt was suggested that we should not miss any opportunity of strengthening the link between Singapore and Malaya. The presentposition under which the two areas were constitutionally on a different footing was anomalous. On the other hand, unification withSingapore would weaken the status of the Rulers.(c) Australia and New Zealand had both now agreed to keeptroops in the area in peacetime and should be kept informed of theprogress of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s negotiations. It was also desirable that the South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty powers should be kept informed.
9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (55) 80) on the question of introducing a pensions increase Bill to improve the pensions of retired members of the public services, both civil and military.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although the internal economic position made further economy desirable, he felt that itwould be necessary to introduce a Pensions Increase Bill shortly afterthe recess. If further delay occurred, the scale of the increases proposed might have to be raised still further.The Minister of Pensions said that he approved the proposals in CP. (55) 80, but he was concerned about one or two aspectsaffecting the timing and presentation of a Pensions Increase Bill.The recent rise in the retail price index was likely to lead in the nextfew weeks to increased pressure for a rise in the rates of publicassistance; the findings of the current review of the position of widows receiving a pension of only 10,s, a week were not likely tobe announced until February 1956. It would be difficult to hold theposition in these two cases after a decision to introduce a pensions increase Bill had been made public. With regard to presentation,he considered it important not to put forward the case for a pensionincrease for public servants on grounds of hardship, since many ofthe pensioners concerned had other means, and such a descriptionwould involve difficulties with the recipients of national assistancewho were subject to a means test. The decision should be taken on grounds of equity and justice rather than of hardship.In discussion it was suggested that, by taking the proposedpensions increase a little further, the Government could clearthemselves of the accusation, which had been levelled at them by theOpposition during the Election, that they had broken faith withretired officers. Against this, it was argued that there was a danger that, by going too far, the Government would merely encourage afurther round of claims.It was agreed that it would be necessary to consult the Ministerof Health and the Ministers responsible for the nationalised industries in working out the details of a scheme for pensions increases.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate in dues3ourse proposals for a scheme of pensions increases.Pensions.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 27thConclusions,Minute 5.)(d) The present relationship between the Governor of singapore and his new Chief Minister (Mr. Marshall) was unsatisfactory andhad been brought to a head by two motions tabled in the SingaporeChamber for the following day. The Colonial Secretary said that he hoped that Mr. Marshall would remain in office until he arrived in singapore.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in CP. (55) 81, subject to the points made in discussion.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary and the Minister of State forForeign Affairs, to arrange for the Governments ofAustralia and New Zealand and the South-East AsiaCollective Defence Treaty Powers to be kept informed,as necessary, about the progress of his discussions on constitutional development in Malaya.
Guided 10.  The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister of weapons. Defence (CP. (55) 86) seeking approval for the answer to be givenTraining Range to a Parliamentary Question about the establishment of a guidedin the Hebrides, weapons training range in the Hebrides.The Secretary of State for Air said that the range would be usedfor surface-to-air and air-to-air firing. At the present time themaximum range of the weapons to be tested was not likely to exceed100 miles, but the area of the training range would be extended as new weapons were developed. Adequate safety precautions on theusual lines would be taken whenever firing was contemplated.In discussion, certain drafting amendments were suggested tothe passage in the proposed answer which related to compensation,and it was agreed that this passage should be settled by the Ministerof Defence in consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland.It was pointed out that the Australians ought to be notified of the establishment of the range before an announcement was madein Parliament, in order to avoid arousing fears that the use of theWoomera range was being in any way abrogated. It would also be advisable to inform the Australian Minister for Supply, who was atpresent visiting guided weapons establishments in the United States,if this had not been done already.It would be for the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, to settle what steps, such as a proclamation of British sovereignty, should be taken to ensure thatthe island of Rockall was not used by a foreign Power&apos; to observefiring on the range.The Cabinet (1) Approved the terms of the answer proposed by the Ministerof Defence, subject to consultation with the Secretaryof State for Scotland about the passage relating to compensation.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Minister of Defence, to inform the appropriateAustralian authorities about the decision to establish the range.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21st July, 1955.
