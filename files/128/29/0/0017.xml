Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Austrian State Treaty Bill was to be passed through all its stages in the House of Commons on 29th June.Cyprus.(previous reference:CM. (55) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Colonial Secretary said that the latest disturbances in cyprus might compel the Governor to declare a state of emergency and even to arrest Archbishop Makarios or the Bishop of Kyreniafor incitement to violence. The Governor had deferred his plans for moving from Nicosia to the hill station of Troodos.The Minister of Defence said that he hoped to put before theCabinet by the end of the following week the proposals of theCommittee which they had appointed on 14th June to consider meansof promoting further constitutional advance in Cyprus. Conditionsin the Island might, however, make it impossible to proceed with these plans at the present time.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Aden. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ColonialSecurity of the Secretary (CP. (55) 47) seeking approval of certain measures toProtectorate.    improve the security of the Aden Protectorate.(Previous The Colonial Secretary said that the incidents which the cabinet reference:      had discussed at their last meeting emphasised the urgency of thisCM. (55) 16th  problem. There could now be no doubt that the King of the Yemen,Conclusions,     who had recently strengthened his internal position, was activelyMinute 4.)       helping dissident elements in the Western Protectorate. He therefore proposed to obtain immediately from the Governor of Aden plans for counter measures which were known to be ready, and to authorisethe taking of these, subject to the approval of the Prime Minister, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Foreign Secretary.   He alsosought authority for the immediate provision of a sum of  76,000 tostrengthen the administration of the poorer States of the WesternProtectorate, and for the formation of three additional squadrons ofthe Aden Protectorate Levies.  At the appropriate moment it mightbe desirable to make it clear by a statement in Parliament that we\^  intended resolutely to fulfil our obligations as the protecting Power.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the situation called for prompt and effective action. He supported the colonial secretary&apos;s proposals, subject to the normal financial scrutiny of detailed proposals.In discussion the view was again expressed that the immediate situation in the Western Protectorate made it urgently necessary tomake some armoured cars available for use there against the rebels.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the increased support whichthe rebels had lately been receiving from the Yemen had turned thesituation to our disadvantage. A comparatively small rebel force,supplied from across the Yemeni frontier, was proving extremelydifficult to eliminate and, in particular, was making it hard to keepRobat Fort supplied. Some armoured cars suitable for use in thelocal terrain would undoubtedly be most valuable; but, owing totheir shortage of water, the garrison at Robat must be relieved beforearmoured cars could be made available. All possible steps werebeing taken, within the limits of the forces available locally, to deal effectively with the situation. A large-scale operation was to beundertaken within, the next few days. Levies would be used for thispurpose, but units of the R.A.F. Regiment from Aden Colony werebeing brought up to relieve Levy units required as reinforcements.
The authorities on the spot attached great importance to the taking of such non-military measures as were practicable to undermine the present rebel activity in the Western Protectorate.The Prime Minister said that a situation in which a handful ofrebels armed with rifles could challenge so successfully the combinedsecurity forces of Aden clearly called for a thorough review of thescale and organisation of those forces. The Minister of Defence andthe Colonial Secretary should at once make arrangements for such a review to be undertaken, and he hoped that these would include thedespatch of senior officers from the Army and the Royal Air force to investigate the position on the spot and make recommendations.Meanwhile, he suggested that the Cabinet might approve the provisionof money for the strengthening of the local administration and theformation of additional squadrons of Levies. Urgent consideration should also be given to the best means of making armoured carsavailable.In further discussion it was suggested that diplomatic means of influencing the situation in our favour ought not to be ignored. Usemight well be made of such influence as the King of Jordan enjoyedwith the King of the Yemen, and the help of the Prime Minister ofIraq might also be enlisted for the purpose.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary and the Minister of Defence toarrange for an immediate review to be made of the security situation in the Aden Protectorate, and to report theresults of this review to the Cabinet as soon as possible.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider and report to thePrime Minister how armoured cars could best be madeavailable for use in the Western Aden Protectorate at theearliest possible date.(3) Approved in principle the proposals put forward in cp. (55) 47 for expenditure on the improvement of theadministration of the poorer States in the Western aden protectorate, and the immediate formation of additionalsquadrons of the Aden Protectorate Levies.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether the king of Jordan and the Prime Minister of Iraq should not be urged to warn the King of the Yemen that further Yemeniinterference in the affairs of the Aden Protectorate wouldnot be tolerated by the protecting Power.Coal Prices.(previous reference:CC. (55) 22ndConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (55) 45) seeking their approval of a proposal by the National Coal Board to increase the pit-head prices of coalby 20 per cent., or an average of 125. Sd. a ton.The Minister of Fuel and Power recalled that, in discussionsbefore the General Election, the Cabinet had recognised that coal prices would have to be raised, before very long. The increase nowproposed was large, but he was satisfied that it was no larger than was necessary to cover the estimated increase in the Board&apos;s costs.When coal was scarce, it would be wrong that a nationalised industry should supply it at prices below the cost of production. Even if prices were raised by 20 per cent., there would be a deficit of  9 million onthe Board&apos;s operations during 1955 and the accumulated deficit would rise to  26 million by the end of the year. This increase was necessaryin order to enable the Board to fulfil their obligation to make theindustry pay, taking one year with another.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this question had beenconsidered by the Economic Policy Committee, who were satisfiedthat a substantial increase in coal prices was now inevitable.   He
himself considered that this was justified, not only by the increased costs of production, but on wider economic grounds as well. he believed that it would be good for the national economy if the pricemechanism v/ere allowed to work in respect of coal, as well as other materials; and that higher coal prices would help to check the inflationary pressures which were at work in the economy. higher prices might also encourage a more economical use of coal, which was becoming increasingly important now that this country seemed likelyto become a net importer of coal. He therefore hoped that the cabinet would approve the proposal for a 20 per cent, increase.In discussion there was general agreement that a substantial increase in coal prices was inevitable. Discussion turned on thequestion whether the prices should be increased by 20 per cent, orby 18 per cent.In favour of the higher figure it was argued that frequent changesin the price of coal were inconvenient, both politically and industrially.Export industries, in particular, were handicapped in quoting firmprices for forward deliveries if coal prices were constantly increasing.If prices were now raised by 20 per cent., it should be possible to avoid any further increase for some time. Indeed, there might be apossibility that prices might be reduced after 18 months or so, if theBoard then foresaw a surplus on their current operations. A sharpincrease in prices would encourage economy in industrial consumptionof coal, and would also help to accelerate, in certain industries, a transfer from coal to oil as a source of power.On the other hand attention was drawn to the consequences which an increase in coal prices would produce in other sectors of the economy. It would directly raise the cost-of-living index figure byone point, and its indirect effects on the cost of living would eventually be even more serious. It would thus serve to stimulate demands for wage increases. It would add about  9 million a year to the operating costs of British Railways, and would thus hasten the day when theTransport Commission would have to apply for further increases in fares and freight charges. It would add  1 million a year to the costof operating fishing trawlers, and would strengthen the claim of the fishing industry for an increased Government subsidy. If prices were increased by 20 per cent., the Coal Board were likely to show, at theend of 1956, a surplus of  20 million on the year&apos;s working, and their accumulated deficit would by then have been reduced to  6 million.This was a very small figure in relation to the total turnover of theundertaking. These were strong arguments for not advancing coal prices at the present stage beyond the minimum required to offset theincreased cost of production.The Cabinet agreed that the balance of the arguments lay infavour of limiting to 18 per cent, the proposed increase in the pit-headprice of coal.In further discussion the following points were also made:  (a) Differential prices for coal had borne hardly on some industries. Steel production in Scotland had been speciallyhandicapped by them. The Cabinet were assured that the Coal Boardintended to discuss this question with the industries affected, with aview to devising special arrangements for them.(b) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, in view of thepersistent shortage of coal, no opportunity should be lost of developingother sources of power. He was pressing forward with his programmeof conversion from coal to oil; and he had, in addition, asked theLord President to consider whether it would be practicable to accelerate the existing programme for the production of power fromnuclear energy.The Lord President said that, while he had undertaken to consider this, he doubted whether it would prove to be either practicable or desirable. The pace of the programme was limited by the shortageof skilled technicians of various kinds.   Moreover, the design of
reactors was improved by experience in building them; and it was doubtful whether it would be wise, even if it were practicable, to buildmore of them simultaneously. He hoped, for these reasons, that no public reference would be made to the possibility of acceleratingthis programme.The Cabinet Agreed that pit-head prices of coal should be increased by18 per cent, from the middle of July; and invited the Ministerof Fuel and Power to ask the National Coal Board to adjust their proposals accordingly.industrial disputes.Ocean Liners.(previous reference:CM. (55) 16thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the attorney-General (CP. (55) 50) on the right of merchant seamen to withhold their labour. The memorandum concluded that, once aseaman was &quot; lawfully engaged,&quot; he became subject to the disciplinarycode contained in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and had nolonger the right to strike which was enjoyed by those employed inother industries. It was clear that a seaman was &quot; lawfully engaged &quot;when he had signed articles, but he might be held to be so engagedbefore doing so, for example by agreeing to serve as a seaman.The Cabinet were informed that all the seamen on strike whohad recently been reported by the Merchant Navy Establishment Poolas having left the industry and had since been summoned for medical examination were men who had signed articles and were striking in breach of them.The Cabinet Took note of CP. (55) 50.Administrative        6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the tribunals.       Lord Chancellor (CP. (55) 44) outlining his proposals for an(Previous        independent enquiry into practice and procedure in relation to reference:      administrative tribunals and quasi-judicial enquiries.CM. (55), 15th The Cabinefs discussion turned first on the scope of the proposedConclusions, enquiry. It was agreed that the terms of reference of the CommitteeMinute 7.) should be so drawn as to exclude from the enquiry the ordinaryday-to-day administrative decisions taken by a Minister or byDepartmental officials acting on his behalf. Even if these were excluded, however, the field for enquiry was large. The Minister of housing and Local Government said that his Department dealt eachyear with about 600 compulsory purchase orders and about 5,000planning decisions. The procedure prescribed by statute was alreadycomplicated and slow and it should be recognised that, if still furthersafeguards were to be provided, the pace of administration would beslowed down still further. The Minister said that there were other questions which the Committee should consider besides those set outin paragraph 4 of CP. (55) 44: he would bring these to the notice ofthe Lord Chancellor.On the composition of the proposed Committee several points were raised. The view was expressed that there would be advantage inadding to the Committee one or two Civil Servants with special experience on this subject. If, however, it were decided that CivilServants should not serve on the Committee but should give evidence to it. Local Government officials should similarly make their contribution as witnesses rather than as members of the Committee.Doubt was also expressed about the need to include Trade union representatives on the Committee.
remuneration of Ministers.(previous reference:CC. (55) 11thConclusions,Minute 1.)Expenses of peers.(previous reference:CC. (55) 20thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (55) 46) making proposals forthe improvement of Ministers&apos; remuneration, and suggesting that thematter might be considered in detail by a small Committee of senior ministers.The Lord President said that, before the Cabinet reacheddecisions on Ministers&apos; remuneration, he would wish them to consideragain the case for introducing a scheme of allowances to Peers forattendance on their Parliamentary duties in the House of Lords.The Prime Minister suggested that the same Committee should consider both these matters.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to appoint a small Committee of senior Ministers to consider and report to the Cabinet on(i) the remuneration of Ministers and (ii) the introduction ofa scheme of expenses allowances for Peers.South Africa.defence -operation.(previous reference:CC. (54) 59thConclusions,Minute 11.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary, the Minister of Defence and the First Lordof the Admiralty (CP. (55) 51) reporting the stage reached in current discussions with the South African Minister of Defence on defence questions of common concern to the United Kingdom Governmentand the Union Government.The Minister of Defence said that the Defence Committee had laid down, at a meeting on 10th June, the general lines on which these discussions with Mr. Erasmus were to be conducted (D.C. (55)3rd Meeting, Minute 1). The stage reached in the discussions was nowbeing reported to the Cabinet, and their urgent guidance was being sought, as Mr. Erasmus was anxious to make an immediatereport to his Government before they dispersed from Cape Town. Asa result of several days&apos; discussion it seemed likely that we could obtain a satisfactory agreement on the Simonstown naval base and on naval co-operation generally; but there was little prospect of obtaining a firm promise of South African co-operation in the defence of theMiddle East or of persuading the South Africans to abandonaltogether their project of an African Defence Organisation. Thegeneral question on which he sought the guidance of the cabinet was whether, in further negotiation, he and his colleagues should aim at concluding an agreement on Simonstown and on naval co-operation, together with a promise of military staff talks on theMiddle East; or whether, in default of a firm South African promise to co-operate in the defence of the Middle East, the whole of thediscussions should be adjourned. He would himself prefer to follow the first of these courses.The Prime Minister said that he would not put too high a valueon a South African undertaking to contribute towards the defence ofthe Middle East. In the event, the decision whether or not SouthAfrican troops should be sent to the Middle East in war would betaken by the Union Government of the day in the light of thecircumstances then prevailing. Secret staff talks, to which mr. Erasmus might be persuaded to assent, would give us almost as much assurance of eventual South African support in this area as any formal commitment by the present Government of the Union.The Prime Minister suggested that the Cabinet should go into these points in greater detail at a later meeting.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of CP. (55) 44 at a later meeting.
He would therefore prefer to concentrate at this stage on securingthe most satisfactory agreements that we could obtain on the simonstown base and on naval co-operation. On the latter point theagreement which Mr. Erasmus was ready to sign met all our requirements. The South Africans were prepared to place in thiscountry orders for naval vessels to the value of  18 million, and thiswould have the effect of linking the South African Navy to the royal navy for many years to come. As regards Simonstown, theagreement now proposed was defensible so far as strategic considerations were concerned. It was more open to criticism on grounds of discrimination against coloured workers, and we should try to improve the safeguards which it provided for them.The Cabinefs discussion centred mainly on Clause 9 (a) of thedraft agreement on the Simonstown naval base, under which theUnion Government were to agree that, if there were a deficiency of qualified European labour in the dockyard, non-Europeans of the required standard would be recruited on a basis of merit. It wasagreed that, in the further discussions, every effort should be made to persuade Mr. Erasmus to give a firmer assurance that racial discrimination would be avoided in the recruitment of new labour for the dockyard. Thus, he might be asked to undertake that therewould be no discrimination based on colour in the recruitment oflabour in the dockyard. Alternatively, he might be willing to give, inrespect of future recruitment, some assurance containing the sameformula for avoiding &quot; discrimination between Europeans and non-Europeans &quot; as he was ready to accept in respect of existingemployees in the dockyard. At the least, he should be pressed toagree that paragraph 9 (a) of the existing draft agreement should be amended to provide that there would be &quot; no bar to the recruitment of non-Europeans of the required standard where this was found tobe necessary to ensure the maintenance of a sufficient labour force.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence, in his further discussions with the South African Minister of Defence, to pressstrongly for further safeguards for the future recruitment of coloured workers at the naval base at Simonstown, onthe lines which had been suggested in the cabinets discussion.. (2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, agreed that it shouldcontinue to be a primary objective in these discussions toobtain a satisfactory agreement on the transfer of the naval base at Simonstown and on naval co-operation generally,and that attainment of that objective should not be prejudiced by insistence on a firm South African promise of co-operation in the defence of the Middle East.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd June, 1955.
