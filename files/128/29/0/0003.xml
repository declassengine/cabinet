The Budget. 1.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicated to theCabinet particulars of the proposals in the forthcoming Budget.In accordance with precedent, details are not recorded in theCabinet Conclusions.Cotton. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the President of the(Previous        Board of Trade (CP. (55) 5) covering the draft of a ParliamentaryReference:      statement on the current difficulties of the cotton industry.CM. (55) 2nd        The Cabinefs discussion turned on the extent to which theConclusions,    current difficulties of the cotton industry could be relieved byMiuute 5.)      adjustment of the purchase tax on cotton goods.  They had learnedfrom the statement which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had madeon the content of his forthcoming Budget that purchase tax on allcloth, other than woollen cloth, was to be reduced from 50 per cent,to 25 per cent.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, now that they were aware of the substance of the Budget proposals, his colleagues would appreciate how difficult it was for him to do more for Lancashireby way of adjustment of the purchase tax on cotton goods. It wasthe essence of his Budget plan that the Finance Bill should be suffiently short and simple to be passed into law before parliament was dissolved. It would therefore deal only with the alterations in income tax: his projected changes in the purchase tax would bemade by an Order. A simple reduction of the rate of tax on cotton cloth could be made by Order, and this was as far as he thoughtit right to go. If it were desired to make more far-reaching adjust-ments in the incidence of purchase tax on cotton goods, it wouldbe necessary to make alterations in the structure of the tax. Thiswas a difficult and complicated matter, and there was no prospectof completing work on it before Parliament was dissolved. In hisearlier consideration of this problem he had assumed that it wouldbe possible to impose a quota on imports of grey cotton cloth from india, and that this action would obviate the need for any substantialadjustment of purchase tax on cotton goods. It was unfortunate that this remedy had been excluded by the later news that the indian government were considering a reduction of their duties on importsof cotton goods into India. He recognised that this change in thesituation made it necessary that some concession on purchase taxshould be made; but it would be inconsistent with his general plan for handling the Budget to make any larger concession than that\   which he now proposed.In discussion there was general support for the view that the limited adjustment of purchase tax which the Chancellor of theExchequer was proposing to make would not suffice to satisfy thepolitical demand for Government action to relieve the difficulties ofthe cotton industry. The enlarged opportunities for exports of high-quality cloth, which would be opened up by a reduction in the Indianimport duties, would be of no benefit to that section of the Lancashiretrade which was suffering from increased imports of grey cotton clothfrom India. This section in particular, and the cotton industry generally, were looking for some compensating advantages on thehome market, and were hoping for a much greater reduction in the incidence of purchase tax on cotton goods. The concession proposedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which would cost the Exchequeronly  3 millions in a full year, would be regarded by the industry as a wholly inadequate response to their plea for help. Would it not be possible to forgo the whole of the purchase tax on cotton cloth?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if the rate of purchase tax on cotton cloth was reduced below 25 per cent.j therewould be serious administrative difficulties in collecting the tax anda dangerous degree of tax evasion.   He saw no way of avoiding

The Minister of Labour said that the Chairman of theTrades Union Congress was that afternoon presiding over a meeting between representatives of the unions concerned in the newspaperdispute. When the results of that meeting were known it might bepossible to assess the prospects of breaking the present deadlock. If itappeared that the strike was likely to continue for some time longer,the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association would probably go forward with the project of publishing, as a joint undertaking, a single Londonnewspaper.The Minister of Labour reported to the Cabinet the decisionof the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen tocall a strike of their members on 1st May. This decision had beentaken in protest against the award of the Railway Staff NationalTribunal, which had rejected their latest wage claim. A statement on the situation would be issued that evening by the British transport commission.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements by the Minister of Labourand agreed to resume their discussion of these two industrial disputes at their meeting on the following day.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th April, 1955.these results without detailed alterations in the structure of the tax,for which further legislation would be needed. Moreover, so large a concession would undoubtedly provoke demands from otherindustries which had at least as good a case for relief, and there wasa real risk that the system of purchase tax would be progressivelyundermined.On this last point it was argued in discussion that the Chancellorof the Exchequer would be on strong ground in limiting hisconcession to the cotton and linen industries. He could then claim that he was using taxation as an instrument of policy for the purposeof alleviating or averting unemployment in two particular industries,in Lancashire and in Northern Ireland.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would reconsiderhis proposal in the light of the views expressed by his colleagues in the Cabinefs discussion.The Cabinet-Agreed to defer until a later meeting their considerationof the steps to be taken to relieve the current difficultiesin the cotton industry.
