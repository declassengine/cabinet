1. The Prime Minister said that, although the final result of theGeneral Election was not yet known, it was already evident that theGovernment would have an effective majority in the Houseof Commons. He expressed his appreciation of the strenuous efforts made by all members of the Government throughout the election campaign, and his gratitude to the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster for the efficient service given by the Headquarters of theParty organisation.The Foreign Secretary said that he would like to express onbehalf of his colleagues in the Government their deep appreciation of the Prime Ministers inspiring leadership in the campaign.2. The Minister of Labour said that there now appeared to belittle prospect of persuading the Executive of the Associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (A.S.L.E.F.) to withdraw theinstructions they had issued to their members to strike at midnight on 28th May. The Union held the view that the British transport commission had gone back upon an undertaking to maintain certain minimum differentials between the pay of locomotive men and thatof other railway workers, and they had consistently refused to take part in any discussions to which the National Union of Railwaymen(N.U.R.) were a party. The latest example of the Union&apos;s obduracywas their refusal to agree to the appointment of a conciliation board under the Conciliation Act, 1896, which was favoured by the TradesUnion Congress (T.U.C.) and accepted by the N.U.R. The strikecould be averted now only by making some financial offer toA.S.L.E.F. without any corresponding concession to the N.U.R. Hecould not recommend this course, which would at best procure onlya temporary respite from trouble on the railways.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that, in the situationdescribed, it would not be right for the Government to put any pressure on the Transport Commission to make further concessions to A.S.L.E.F., despite the serious implications of the threatenedstrike.The Prime Minister said that he had been considering whether,before a strike began, it would be desirable that he should inviterepresentatives of the T.U.C. or possibly of the Unions concerned to discuss the situation with him.The Minister of Labour said that, if the Prime Minister were now to invite representatives of A.S.L.E.F. to see him, this mightset an awkward precedent. He would, of course, himself remainin constant touch both with the Unions concerned and with theT-U.C, who admitted that there seemed to be nothing further theycould do to avert the threatened strike.The Cabinet agreed that the Prime Minister should not exclude the possibility of his seeing representatives of the T.U.C. or of theUnions concerned if this should appear to the Minister of Labourand him to be required by further developments in the situation.The view was also expressed that a message should be broadcast to the nation showing how indef atigably the Minister of Labour had worked, in close consultation with the Prime Minister, to avert the threat of a railway strike. In particular, mention should be madepublicly of the proposal for the appointment of a conciliation board,which A.S.L.E.F. had rejected.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that a broadcastby the Prime Minister on these lines would serve a most valuablepurpose and that it should be made, if necessary, on the evening ofthe following day.
Parliament. 3.   The Prime Minister invited the Cabinet to consider whether,Opening of if the threatened railway strike was not averted, the date of theNew Session. Opening of Parliament should be advanced from 14th June to10th June. This would be inconvenient from many points of view,including that of preparing The Queen&apos;s Speech; but the strike wouldhave such serious consequences that Parliament would expect to begiven the earliest practicable opportunity of discussing it. Parliament\ was summoned to meet on 7th June: by 10th June the House ofv Commons would have elected a Speaker and the majority of members would have been sworn. By then the strike would have been inprogress for nearly a fortnight: serious effects would be showingthemselves, and Members would be anxious to discuss the situationwithout further delay. Moreover, the Emergency Regulations to bemade under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, would have to be laidbefore Parliament when it met on 7th June and would expire atmidnight on 14th June unless they had previously been continued in force by affirmative resolutions passed by both Houses. if parliament was not opened until 14th June, neither House wouldbe able to consider the Regulations until late in the day on whichthey were due to expire. If, however, the date of the Opening ofParliament were advanced to 10th June, it would be possible to adjourn the Debate on the Address after the opening speeches bythe mover and seconder of the Address and to proceed to a general debate on the strike. Resolutions approving the emergency regulations could also be tabled on that day and approved, ifnecessary after debate, on 13th June. The Debate on the Addresscould then be resumed on 14th June.In discussion there was general support for the Prime Minister^suggestion. If the threatened strike was not averted, there would be strong grounds for advising Her Majesty to open Parliament onThe Cabinet were also informed of the state of the arrangementsfor maintaining essential services in the event of a strike. It was theintention that, if the strike occurred, a proclamation of emergency should be made on 31st May under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920,and that Emergency Regulations should immediately be broughtinto force. The Cabinet were further informed that the Post office would be issuing an announcement on the morning of 29th Mayabout the use of the telephone and acceptance of parcels; that ageneral announcement of advice and information to the public wouldbe issued at noon on the same day; that the War Office would berefusing leave unobtrusively to a limited number of officers and men,including men needed for duty with the Post Office early on WhitMonday; and that it was proposed to make arrangements to cancel the rehearsal of the Trooping the Colour which had been arranged for 1st June.Attention was drawn to the fact that paragraph 2 of the passage in the proposed general announcement dealing with transport arrangements appeared to require revision now that the announce-ment would be made two days before the proclamation of emergency.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposal that, in the event of a railway strike,Her Majesty should be advised to proclaim an emergencyon 31st May, and that Emergency Regulations should then be made.(2) Invited the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for the draftof the proposed general announcement particularlySection III, paragraph 2 to be reviewed in the light ofthe present time-table of action.
10th June. If arrangements were once made to open parliament on that date, the balance of advantage would lie against revertingto the later date if the strike should collapse. The change in thearrangements for the Opening of Parliament should be made knownas soon as the making of a proclamation of emergency was announced. The Leaders of the Opposition Parties should beinformed before the announcement was made.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, if the threatened railway strike was not averted,the Prime Minister should advise Her Majesty to openParliament on 10th June, so that the two Houses could have the earliest practicable opportunity of discussing thestrike and of passing resolutions approving the emergency regulations to be made under the Emergency powers act, 1920.(2) Agreed that in this event the change in the arrangementsfor the Opening of Parliament should be announced on31st May; and invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrangefor the Leaders of the Opposition Parties to be informedshortly before the public announcement was made.4. The Prime Minister said that, in view of the decision recorded in the preceding Minute, no time should be lost in preparing a draftof The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament. A small committee of Ministers should at once prepare a draft forconsideration by the Cabinet on 2nd June. It would be necessarythat the final text of the speech should be settled by 6th June.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a Committee ofMinisters to prepare a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on theOpening of Parliament for consideration by the Cabineton 2nd June.5. The Colonial Secretary said that he had under considerationproposals by the Governor of Kenya for withdrawing the surrenderterms which had been offered to Mau Mau terrorists in January.These raised some difficult issues, on which he would have wishedto consult his colleagues if time had been available. He would circulate a memorandum to the Cabinet setting out the Governorsproposals and his comments on them. This might be consideredby the Cabinet at their next meeting on 2nd June. He might,however, find it necessary to send instructions to the Governor before then.  If so, he would seek the Prime Minister^ authority to do so.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,27th May, 1955.The Queen&apos;sSpeech on theOpening ofParliament.Kenya.    xSurrenderOffer.(previous reference:C.C.
