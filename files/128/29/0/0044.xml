Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons &quot;in the following week.The Cabinet recognised that, in the proposed debate on Cypruson 5th December, the Government spokesmen would not be able to. - give, any indication of the state of the discussions between the&quot; Governor of Cyprus and Archbishop Makarios, unless by then it had become clear that there was no hope of securing the Archbishop&apos;sco-operation and that the time had come to make public theproposals which Her Majesty&apos;s Government had put forward.The Cabinet were informed that it was hoped that parliament would rise for the Christmas recess on 21st December. An announce-ment to that effect would be made by the Lord Privy Seal in thecourse of his business statement, but he would point out that thiswould depend on sufficient progress being made with the businessbefore the House..It was pointed out that it was particularly desirable that theCommittee Stage of the Housing Subsidies Bill should be completed before the Christmas recess.House of 2.   The Lord Privy Seal said that it had now come to light thatCommons Mr. C. Beattie, M.P., was probably disqualified on the ground thatDisqualification, he had been appointed by the Northern Ireland Minister of Labour(Previous and National Insurance to be a member of three Appeal Tribunals.Reference: This was a particularly unfortunate case for two reasons. First,CM. (55) 39th the Prime Minister had informed the House of Commons on conclusions, 29th November that, as a result of the examination made by minute 3.) Government Departments in Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Mr. C. Beattie, it was hoped that no further cases of this kind would arise. Secondly,M.P. Mr. Beattie had been declared to be the Member for Mid-Ulsteras the result of a petition to disqualify the Sinn Fein candidate whohad secured a majority at the by-election of 11th. August, 1955.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the doubt about Mr. Beattie&apos;s position should be disclosed to the House of Commonswithout delay, and that thereafter the Attorney-General should report  the matter  to  the  Select Committee  for  investigation.&apos; Meanwhile, Mr. Beattie had been advised not to attend sittings of theHouse of Commons.It was also the general view of the Cabinet that in all thecircumstances it would be virtually impossible for the Governmentto regard Mr. Beattie&apos;s election as valid, and that it would therefore benecessary to arrange for a further by-election in Mid-Ulster, althoughit was likely that a Sinn Fein candidate would receive a majority ofthe votes, which would entail a further election petition.The Cabinet   Agreed that the case of Mr. Beattie. should be disclosed to. the House of Commons without delay, and that the matter should be referred to the Select Committee which was already in being.Road HaulageDisposals Bill.(previous reference:CM. (55) 39thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet considered what steps should be taken to allay the anxiety which was known to exist among certain government supporters over the policy embodied in the Road Haulage DisposalsBill.The Minister of Transport said that Government supporters hadbeen prepared to accept, although With some reluctance, the need to retain the vehicles required for the trunk services when he had announced in July the Cabinefs decision on this matter. But, inthe meantime, and no doubt as a result of pressure exerted byinterested parties, a widespread anxiety had developed that the policyembodied in the Road Haulage Disposals Bill was not in accordance49606^1B 2
with Conservative principles and would be contrary to the under-takings given by the Party during the Election. These misgivingswere entertained mainly by Members who had not specially concerned themselves with transport questions, and the possibilityCould not be excluded that some Government supporters wouldabstain from voting in favour of the Bill or would even vote against it. The drafting of the Bill was now neacing completion, but heifelt that, before it could be introduced,, it Would be necessary tomake further efforts to allay the concern which had been expressed.A meeting of Government supporters for this purpose had -beenarranged for 8th December.&quot;The view was expressed in discussion that the objections raisedby those Government supporters who had experience of transportmatters lay, not so much against the decision to preserve the trunkservices as a transport entity, but rather against the proposed arrangement under which these vehicles would continue to beretained by the British Transport Commission. The opinion was.held that the trunk services should be formed into a separatecompany and that, while the British Transport Commission might possibly retain a majority shareholding, private interests should been abled to participate on a substantial scale.It was also pointed out that it might prove possible, on furtherconsideration, to take advantage of those provisions in the draftBill which related to disposal by the &quot; company method,&quot; although these provisions had not, in fact, been devised for this purpose.. The.Prime Minister said that, although the Cabinet had already given a great.deal of thought to the policy embodied in the road haulage Disposals Bill, he had no doubt, in view of the points whichhad been made in the discussion, that the provisions of the Bill shouldbe further-, scrutinised. This would best be done by a small committee of Ministers.- The Cabinet Appointed a Committee consisting of .Lord Chancellor (in the Chair),Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,Lord Privy Seal,Colonial Secretary,President of the Board of Trade,Minister of Transport,Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury,to consider again the provisions of the draft Road Haulage. Disposals Bill in the light of their discussion, and to reportto the Cabinet at their next meeting.4] The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Health (CP. (55) 185) setting out, inthe light of the concern on this subject which had been expressedboth in Parliament and in the Press, the arguments for imposing aban on the manufacture of heroin in this country in order to collaborate with the World Health Organisation in their efforts tostamp out the traffic in this dangerous drug.The Minister of Health said that, in arriving at a decision thatthe manufacture of heroin could safely be brought to an end in thiscountry, he had been supported by advice received from his StandingMedical Advisory Committee (S.M.A.C.), a representative andextremely authoritative body, that it would be justifiable, on medical grounds, to take this course. In view, however, of the public and medical concern at this decision which had recently developed, hehad taken the precaution of inviting several of the most distinguishedmembers of the S.M.A.C. to confirm that their-opinion in the matter
kstill held, and they had done so. He was satisfied that much of the agitation which was occurring could be attributed to the efforts ofthe Fellowship for Freedom in Medicine, a professional group hostile to any direction or control which might be inconsistent with the professional freedom of medical men. The interest shown by thePress in the matter had been confined to the London Press andvirtually to The Times newspaper. The Scottish and provincial press had not taken the subject up, and the fleeting interest shown in the popular Press had not been maintained.He had full confidence in the S.M.A.C. which comprised, inaddition to several of the most leading members of the medical profession, a substantial proportion of general practitioners who hadassociated themselves with the advice which the Committee had given in 1954. He recognised that one general practitioner memberhad now come to dissent from the advice previously tendered andhe did not doubt that, if the issue were presented to the S..M.A.C.again, some of the general practitioner members might waver intheir support for a ban on manufacture. On the other.hand, an authoritative leading article which was about to appear inThe Lancet would support the decision which had been announced.He admitted that there was a conflict of medical opinion and thatthere would remain two schools of thought on the need for the useof heroin; and the Government would be exposed to criticismwhether, they confirmed or reversed the decision to ban itsmanufacture. Three-quarters of the world&apos;s supply of this drugwas manufactured in this country and a reversal of our decisions would be difficult to justify in the World Health Organisation, whereseveral Commonwealth countries had followed our lead in deciding to ban manufacture. He was satisfied that it was right to maintainthe decision.The Home Secretary endorsed these views. Two months had elapsed since the decision was announced in February 1955 before any protest was heard and there was no doubt that an artificialagitation on the subject had been worked up. It was a question ofweighing the alleged need for heroin in this country against theopinion of leading medical men who, in advising that adequatesubstitutes for heroin existed, would scarcely risk their professionalreputations on such a matter, and against our interest incollaborating in international action against the drug traffic in whichwe had traditionally played a leading part. Although there were only about 50 known heroin addicts in this country, there were60,000 in the United States and 3,000 in Canada, constituting a gravesocial problem for those countries. Fifty-five countries had now agreed to ban the manufacture of heroin. In this countrymanufacture had been expanding annually.The following points were made in discussion:  . (a) The only important countries which had not yet agreed toban the manufacture of heroin were France, Belgium, Italy and NewZealand.ib) It was not considered practicable to meet our international obligations by exercising an even closer control and supervision overthe manufacture of heroin and by confining its use to the teaching hospitals.ic) Nor would it meet the problem to exercise closer control overexports, for the World Health Organisation were anxious to achieve a general ban on the legal manufacture of this drug in order to beable more effectively to track down the sources of illicit supplies.id) Heroin was not in universal use by the medical professionin this country. Some teaching hospitals used it; others did not.Three of the most distinguished members of the S.M.A.C. (including a leading authority on the treatment of cancer), who had beenspecifically consulted on the point, had confirmed that they never&apos;prescribed heroin.49606-1b 3
(e) The objection to heroin was the great risk that its use would lead to uncontrollable addiction. There were three of four alternativedrugs which, administered with adequate medical skill, could beregarded as satisfactory alternatives.(/) The right of the doctor to prescribe the drug he preferredhad never previously been subject to interference. Were it not forthe question of interference with the freedom of the medical profession in a professional matter, there was little doubt that therewould be general support for the ban among the responsible members. of the profession.It was the general feeling of the Cabinet that the balance of considerations in this matter was very delicately poised. On the onehand, the decision to ban the manufacture of this drug had beentaken with the support of authoritative medical advice which hadbeen confirmed; and there were good grounds for believing that: much of the public concern had been inspired by members of themedical profession for reasons which distorted the merits of thequestion. It was our traditional practice to take a leading part in international action against dangerous drugs and a very large numberof countries had already agreed to ban the manufacture of heroin.On the other hand, several Ministers expressed grave misgivingson a number of points. It appeared that some members at least ofthe S.M.A.C. would now question the advice they had given a yearearlier, and not all members of the medicai profession had taken part in the press campaign for disingenuous reasons. Manygenuinely held that there was no alternative to heroin for certain types of illness. Although three or four satisfactory alternative drugswere said to exist, they had not yet been publicly named. Moreover,the advice given by the leading authorities who had been consultedthat the alternative drugs were entirely satisfactory, depended on thecondition that the drugs were administered with adequate medicalknowledge and skill. Not all sufferers would be treated in teaching hospitals and the general practitioner, who would be faced with theproblem of treating difficult cases in his own area, might not easily be able to gain the knowledge or the skill required to administer the alternatives.After a close consideration of the arguments brought out in their discussion, it was the general view of the Cabinet that the Govern-ment would not be justified in withdrawing the proposed ban on themanufacture of heroin at the end of the year. But, in view of the doubts which had been expressed on a number of important points,the ban should be kept under constant review in the light of experience gained when it had come into operation. It was agreedthat the Home Secretary should reply in this sense to parliamentary questions which he was due to answer that afternoon and the text of a statement to this effect was approved.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the decision, already announced, to impose aban on the manufacture of heroin in this country at theend of the year should be maintained, but that the banwould be subject to constant review in the light of theexperience gained of its operation in practice.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to reply in this sense to parliamentary Questions on this subject which weredown for answer that afternoon.Commonwealth 5.

The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (CP. (55) 183) which described the present constitutional position in the Gold Coast.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, since it was possiblethat the question of admitting the Gold Coast to commonwealth membership might need to be considered at the meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers in June 1956, he recommended thatthe way for such a discussion should be prepared gradually in aseries of talks which the United Kingdom High Commissioner wouldhave with the South African Prime Minister. There had beenindications recently that the attitude of the South African Govern-ment to this question had become less rigid, and it would be best forthe High Commissioner to make his approach without delay and before he visited London next January.The Colonial Secretary said that the adviser on constitutionalmatters (Sir Frederick Bourne), whom he had appointed to the gold coast Government, hoped to have a scheme of constitutional development ready for discussion by a conference of all parties inthat Colony during the present month. If an acceptable scheme could be worked out, there was some possibility that the Gold Coastmight achieve full self-government by the end of 1956; but if, as was more likely, it took longer to work out an acceptable scheme, self-government would not have to be granted before the middle of 1957.The Prime Minister said that it would be preferable if thequestion of admitting the Gold Coast to Commonwealth member-ship did not have to be considered at the meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers in June 1956. It would therefore be not altogetherdisadvantageous if the discussions about constitutional development in the Gold Coast should take some further time.In discussion, strong approval was expressed for a general rulingthat, in the context of Commonwealth membership, it was desirableto use the term &quot; full self-government&quot; and to avoid the word&quot; independence,&quot; since the latter term implied that the constitutional development of Colonial territories entailed the probability that theywould secede from the Commonwealth and might give unnecessaryencouragement to this idea.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to authorise the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner to make an approach beforemid-December to the South African Prime Minister aboutthe admission of the Gold Coast to commonwealth membership.(2) Agreed that the general rule should be adopted of using the term &quot; full self-government&quot; in all references to theconstitutional development of Colonial territories, andthat the use of the term &quot; independence &quot; in this contextshould be discontinued.Overseas 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theExpenditure.    Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (55) 184) on the need for a morerigorous scrutiny of commitments involving additional expenditure overseas.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was anxious todraw the urgent attention of all Departments to the close connectionwhich must be kept in mind between the commitments we might wishto undertake overseas and the resources we possessed to meet them.At present, so far from earning enough to enable us to undertakenew financial commitments overseas, our resources were not sufficientto meet the commitments we already had.   In these circumstances
new commitments could only be undertaken at the cost of running down the reserves. The situation in regard to our expenditure overseas was exacerbated by the excessive demand on our resources at home. The measures which had been taken to combat inflationwould at best restore us to a healthy condition with only our present commitments. There were many proposals for expenditure overseasin support of objectives which might be in the national interest andwere desirable in themselves. But we should defeat our own purposes if we took on more than we could afford, and foundeventually that our commitments were in the aggregate more than we could meet. In such an event it would be necessary to make drastic changes in our policies which would have the serious repercussionsoutlined in his memorandum. There was a tendency for proposalsinvolving additional foreign exchange expenditure to multiply and ithad now become necessary to apply a more rigorous scrutiny to proposals of this kind.In the course of a general discussion the following points weremade:  (a) It would continue to be necessary to contemplate additional expenditure overseas to further and safeguard our longer term economic and political interests. The expenditure on a project couldnot be considered in isolation from the results to be achieved by theexpenditure. The Volta River scheme, for example, was designed tomake the United Kingdom economy independent of the need to incurdollar expenditure for supplies of aluminium. We had entered intothe Kariba project in order to safeguard our supplies of copper from rhodesia. Moreover, any incentive which Colonial territories mighthave for holding their funds in London would be diminished if these territories were given the impression that we were not prepared tofacilitate their capital, development by affording them access to theLondon market.(b) It was pointed out, on the other hand, that the Chancellorof the Exchequer^ memorandum simply stated a mathematical truth in drawing attention to the fact that commitments must be related toresources. If we did not have the resources to undertake all the commitments overseas which it might be in our interests to accept,the need arose to establish some order of priority as between one type of commitment and another. The time for a further assessment of priorities might now have arrived.(c) It was pointed out, as a factor in the same equation, that thenecessary resources to cover our needs overseas would not beavailable while consumption and investment at home continued attheir present excessive levels. Unless demand at home could bebrought under control we faced the risk of not being able to safeguard our vital interests in the Commonwealth and elsewhere, with all theconsequences which that would involve. If the capital investment in modern machinery and equipment now installed in this country couldbe made fully effective by two-shift or three-shift working, additional resources would be created which might be employed in furtherance of our interests abroad.(d) The view was expressed that, if appropriate adjustments in taxation could be made, it would be possible to look to a greaterearnings yield from shipping services. It was, for example, expectedthat the volume of oil shipped would treble over the next ten years.The Cabinet Took note of the memorandum (CP. (55) 184) by theChancellor of the Exchequer.
housing subsidies Bill.(previous references:CM. (55) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3, and cm. (55) 41stConclusions,Minute 1.)Slum ClearanceCompensation.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing (CP. (55) 186) seeking authority to announce that a Bill would be introduced to meet cases of hardship resultingfrom compulsory purchase for slum clearance purposes.The Minister of Housing said that the recent debate on theHousing Subsidies Bill had shown that the existing provisions forslum clearance compensation were inadequate in certain cases and,in particular, that owner-occupiers who had been driven by thehousing shortage to buy unfit property at scarcity prices would receive only a small fraction of their expenditure in compensationif their property was compulsorily purchased. After consultationwith the Prime Minister and the other Ministers concerned, he proposed, in respect of England and Wales, to introduce a Bill tomeet three cases. First, an owner-occupier who had bought an unfithouse between the outbreak of war and the date when the proposed legislation was announced should, if thai house was compulsorilypurchased, or cleared or demolished, receive compensation equal tothe market value of the house immediately before it was declaredunfit. Secondly, the compensation payable in respect of a well-maintained unfit house, which was at present payable on the basisof pre-war building costs, should from time to time be adjusted totake account of changes in the level of costs. Thirdly, where ashop or other business formed part of an unfit dwelling house whichwas compuisorily purchased, or cleared or demolished, owner-occupiers or tenants should receive compensation at market value for the shop or business part of the premises.He sought authority to announce that the government proposed to introduce legislation on these lines, which would haveretrospective effect from the date when the announcement was made.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in agreementwith these proposals, on condition that they did not entail further concessions to meet hardship in Scotland, where compensation forslum clearance was on a different basis.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he did not intend to seek a concession on slum clearance compensation in Scotland,as a result of the proposals in CP. (55) 186. He thought, however,that the proposed concessions might lead to increased pressure forsome concession on compensation payable in respect of compulsorypurchases under the Town and Country Planning Acts.In further discussion it was explained that the market value,on which the compensation proposed in paragraph 3 (a) and (c) of cp. (55) 186 would be assessed, was not exactly the same as theprice which would be obtained from a sale in the open market.Compensation would be based on existing use value, with theaddition of the value for development purposes which the propertyhad in 1947.The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that, if it were proposed to enact the legislation outlined in CP. (55) 186 in thecurrent session, it might well be necessary to remove other projectedlegislation from the legislative programme. The date for theintroduction of the Bill should be considered by the legislation committee.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in CP. (55) 186.
Implications 8.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it now appearedof Foil that it would be difficult to produce a popular version of theEmployment,    projected White Paper on the Implications of Full Employment(Previous        which might not turn out to be politically embarrassing to the reference:       Government.   It had also become clear that it would take longerCM. (55) 42nd  than had been thought previously to complete all the stages of theConclusions,     Finance Bill.   As matters had developed, it would, he suggested,Minute 6.)       be preferable to delay temporarily the publication of the white paper.  This would give further time in which he proposed to study the likely political effect both of the White Paper itself and of a popular version.    He remained  convinced that it was vitally important to educate the public about the relationship of prices and incomes in conditions of full employment, but the White Papermight have a better effect if it were published early in the New Year.The Prime Minister suggested that the Chancellor of theExchequer might explain some of the lessons contained in the white paper in any public speech which he might make in the near future.The Cabinet Approved the proposal of the Chancellor of the exchequer to postpone for the time being publication of the white paper on the Implications of Full Employment.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1st December, 1955.
