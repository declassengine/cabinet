monopolies and restrictive practices.(previous reference :CM. (55) 38thConclusions,Minute 4.)TyreManufacture.2. The Cabinet were informed of objections which had been raised by the tyre manufacturing industry to the publication ofcertain passages in a report of the Monopolies Commission on thesupply of pneumatic tyres.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the industry had nowcommunicated to the Treasury three grounds for their objection tothe publication of the passages in dispute. First, the arrangements in regard to world prices which a leading British company had madewith American tyre manufacturers would almost certainly give riseto an anti-trust suit. Secondly, foreign competitors would derivebenefit from the publication of information on special allowanceswhich were made to certain vehicle manufacturers. Thirdly, theleading British company concerned would be penalised in comparison with its foreign competitors if the- share ownership ofcertain tyre distribution companies were disclosed. The industry had therefore represented that it would be in the public interest for the relevant passages of the report to be suppressed on publication. Hehad not been able, in the time available, to determine whether these arguments were valid, but he felt that a prima facie case had beenestablished to warrant further examination of the matter. he therefore hoped that, in answering a Parliamentary Question that afternoon, the President of the Board of Trade would avoid committing himself to publishing the report in full.The President of the Board of Trade said that under the monopolies Act he had a statutory responsibility to exclude from the published versions of reports of this kind passages which, in his judgment, it would not be in the public interest to disclose. He hadreceived this report in June and, in spite of exhaustive discussions inthe intervening period, the tyre manufacturing industry had failed tosatisfy him that there were good grounds for withholding any partof the report from the public. He had also taken into account theadvice of H.M. Embassy in Washington on possible repercussions in the United States. Although the Question which he was due to answer that afternoon sought information only on the questionwhether he had yet received the report, he expected to be pressed insupplementary Questions to disclose whether or not it was his intention to publish the report in full.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat, until the Chancellor of the Exchequer had had an opportunityto consider the matter more fully, the President of the Board ofTrade should not announce his intention to publish the report infull. In replying to the Question which was to be addressed to him that afternoon, the President should confine himself to a statement that the report had been received and would be laid before parliament in the following month. If he were pressed to say whether the report would be published in full, he should undertake to announce his decision on this point before the date of publication.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Discussion followed on the question whether the committee stage of the Housing Subsidies Bill should be taken in StandingCommittee or in Committee of the whole House. There was strong support for the view that it would be politically disadvantageous toallow the Parliamentary proceedings on this Bill to be undulyprotracted. For this reason it would be preferable, if the Parliamen-tary time-table allowed, to take the Committee Stage on the floor of the House.
The Cabinet    &apos; -Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade to consider, in consultation, the. further representations made by the tyre manufacturing industry regarding the publication of the report of the monopolies Commission on the supply of pneumatic tyres.Broadcasting.The fortnight rule.(previous reference :CM. (55) 31stConclusions,Minute 8.)PartyBroadcastson welsh affairs.(previous reference :CM. (55) 16thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Lord Privy Seal said that the Labour Opposition were evidently proposing to withdraw their support for the rule whichprohibited broadcast discussion of any issue for fourteen days before it was debated in either House of Parliament. They had let it be known that they now intended to propose that this question shouldbe debated by the House of Commons, with a free vote, and thatit should thereafter be made the subject of enquiry by a SelectCommittee,In discussion it was agreed that in the new circumstances an earlydebate would be desirable. The Prime Minister had, however,expressed the view, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, that thiswould not be a suitable subject for enquiry by a Select Committee.It would therefore be convenient if the debate could be so arranged that the House approved the principle of restricting broadcastdiscussion on issues which were about to be debated in Parliamentbut left the detailed application of the principle for negotiation between the Parties. The debate might perhaps be held on a motionapproving the principle.The Cabinet -(1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in his forthcoming statement on business and in further discussions on this questionthrough the usual channels, to be guided by the views expressed in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Labour Opposition were also likely to suggest some modification of the earlier decision aboutregional political broadcasts. They would probably propose thatthere should be two additional Party political broadcasts each year,one for Wales and one for Scotland; but that this should be arrangedcentrally and not through the Regional Advisory Councils.Discussion showed that there was little support in the cabinet for this extension of Party political broadcasting. It was, however,agreed that, if the suggestion were pressed by the Opposition, itshould be considered.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to report to them in due course the upshot of his discussions with the Labour Oppositionon the subject of Party political broadcasts for Wales and scotland.Parliament.Joint select committees.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 28thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Lord President recalled that, when it had been proposedthat the Bills to amend the Army and Air Force Acts should be examined, before introduction, by a Select Committee, the labour opposition in the House of Commons had been unwilling to agreethat this examination should be carried Out by a Joint SelectCommittee of both Houses. The same procedure was now to beapplied to a Naval Discipline Bill, and he understood that theOpposition were again unwilling to agree to the appointment of aJoint Select Committee. This was a subject on which valuable assistance could be obtained from the House of Lords, which included
Peers with long experience of both its legal and its Service aspects.He was, however, reluctant to suggest that the House of Lords should appoint a separate Select Committee to examine the Bill; for it might prove embarrassing for the Government to have two separate reports,possibly expressing divergent views on some points. Could a further attempt be made to persuade the Labour Opposition to agree to theappointment of a Joint Select Committee?In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the Labour party had two reasons for disliking Joint Select Committees first, becauseof the tradition that a Peer should act as Chairman; and secondlybecause, if the composition reflected the proportion of the Parties ineach House, the Committee would have a large Conservativemajority.The Lord President said that on this occasion, as on the twoearlier occasions, he had been quite prepared to meet the views ofthe Labour Party on both these points. He feared that they objectedin principle to this practical co-operation between the two Houses.He therefore hoped that a further attempt might be made to overcometheir opposition.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to make a further attempt to persuade the Labour Opposition in the House of commons to agree to the appointment of a Joint Select Committee onthe Naval Discipline Bill.Egypt* 5.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the financing of theHigh Dam      Aswan High Dam.at Aswan. Tne chancellor of the Exchequer said that the President of the(Previous Board of Trade and he had now discussed the financing of this reference: project with Mr. Kaissouni, the Egyptian Minister of Finance.CM. (55) 39th Mr. Kaissouni had already discussed it at Istanbul with Mr. Black,Conclusions. the President of the International Bank. The Egyptian authorities,Minute 5.) after further examination of their balance of payments outlook, had concluded that it would not be possible for them to embark on theHigh Dam project unless substantial external funds could be assured.Mr. Kaissouni accepted the need for direct aid from the United StatesGovernment, and it was understood that the British firms in the consortium were reconciled to the participation of an American firmin their enterprise as a condition of that aid. Indeed, it would benecessary to look to an American firm to provide the heavy earth-moving equipment that would be needed. There were, however,other problems yet to be overcome. Mr. Black had taken the viewat Istanbul that it would be difficult to fit into the scheme of long-termfinance, which would be. essential for this project, the relativelymoderate amounts of medium-term credit which could be offered bythe consortium. He himself did hot think that Mr. Black wouldpress this point of view to extreme lengths or that it would prove a significant obstacle. The negotiation of an agreement between Egypt* and the Sudan for the division of the Nile Waters presented a muchmore fundamental difficulty. The Egyptians had proposed to the sudanese a division which would give each country 10 milliards ofcubic metres of water after allowing for evaporation. The Sudanesehad countered with a proposal under which the entire loss byevaporation would fall upon the Egyptian share of water, whichwould then amount only to an additional 4 milliards of cubic metres.It was understood that the Sudanese would prefer to see storageworks constructed much further up the Nile than Aswan, since thiswould diminish the considerable losses by evaporation. Finally,there remained the need to reach an understanding with theInternational Bank on the question of international tender.   It was
to be hoped that, in this special case, the Bank would consider their requirements in this matter to be satisfied by the admission of an american firm into the consortium.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the light of these developments, he now recommended that we should (i) pursueurgently the question of obtaining a loan for this project from theInternational Bank on the best terms possible; (ii) continue our efforts to induce the United States Government to give financial support tothe project on terms which would be acceptable to the Egyptians;and (iii) use our good offices to promote an equitable agreementbetween Egypt and the Sudan on the division of the Nile Waters. he sought the authority of his colleagues to follow these three courses.It was agreed in discussion that the views of the Governor ofthe Sudan should be sought on the question of an equitable divisionof the Nile Waters. It was also pointed out that the interests of ourown East African dependencies in the head waters of the Nile mustnot be overlooked.The Cabinet (I) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to pursuefurther, on the lines which he had recommended in thediscussion, the question of obtaining financial assistancefrom the International Bank and the United StatesGovernment for the High Dam project.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofState for Foreign Affairs to consider further what steps might be taken by Her Majesty&apos;s Government to promote the conclusion of an agreement between Egypt and theSudan for the equitable division of the Nile Waters, taking into account the interests of our own East Africandependencies.6. The Colonial Secretary said that British Togoland, which weadministered under trusteeship, was a narrow strip of territory with400,000 inhabitants on the eastern border of the Gold Coast. TheCabinet had agreed in May last year that, with independence forthe Gold Coast approaching, we should invite the United nations to consider future arrangements for British Togoland, giving it as our view that its interests would best be served by integration withthe Gold Coast. The administration of such a small strip of territory would be difficult once we ceased to have responsibility for the gold coast. In the meantime the Trusteeship Council had sent a verycompetent mission to the territory to examine the problem on the spot. This mission would recommend that the inhabitants of BritishTogoland, when the time came to seek their views, should be offered the choice between integration with the Gold Coast and the specificalternative of continued administration under trusteeship pending the determination of their ultimate future. In view of this, it became necessary to consider whether, if the result of a plebiscite wereunfavourable to union with the Gold Coast and the territory elected to remain under trusteeship administration, we would be prepared toaccept a continuing responsibility for administering the area. In his view we had no alternative, in such an event, but to be prepared todo so, for among the likely alternatives there were some which wouldhave dangerous repercussions for us. The United Nations might, ifwe refused, elect to administer the territory directly, and this would at once give the Russians a voice in Colonial affairs and a vantagepoint for interference in Africa. Alternatively, the territory mightbe handed over to a trustee in whom we could have no confidence.The northern part of the territory would probably vote for integra-tion With the Gold Coast, but the leanings of the southern inhabitantswere more doubtfuh
In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was unthinkable that we should appear to eject from ourmidst people for whom we had been responsible by refusing tocontinue to administer them in the circumstances which had beenoutlined.(b) The possibility that the Togoland tribes might vote againstunion with the Gold Coast opened up the prospect of yet anothersmall territory which could not be self-supporting. It was pointedout, however, that separate administration would continue only foran interim period, for eventually permanent arrangements wouldhave to be made for British Togoland whose future could not beconsidered in isolation from the future of the neighbouring FrenchTogoland.(c) It was also pointed out that the termination of the trusteeshipover British Togoland was in any event dependent upon the continuedadvance of the Gold Coast to self-government. It was not yet clearthat the Ashanti and northern districts of the Gold Coast were fully in support of the independence proposals.The Colonial Secretary said that, unless the investigation whichwas now being carried out showed a much stronger feeling in these districts of the Gold Coast in favour of independent government andthe constitution which would provide for it, it might yet be necessaryto reconsider our position in the matter. Meanwhile, he was concerned in regard to Togoland to take up in the United Nations aposition which would exclude any risk of the territory falling intoundesirable hands.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, while the course proposed by the Colonial Secretary should be followed in the forth-coming discussion of Togoland at the United Nations, the future ofthis territory and its relations with the Gold Coast raised more general issues which it would be desirable to consider separately.The Colonial Secretary undertook to circulate a memorandumon this subject.The Cabinet (I) Agreed that, in the forthcoming discussion of BritishTogoland at the United Nations, Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should state their willingness to accept responsibilityfor the continued administration of the territory in thecircumstances outlined by the Colonial Secretary.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to circulate to the cabinet a memorandum on the more general issues which hadbeen raised in their discussion.Capital City 7.   The Home Secretary said that for some time past there hadoi Wales. been a widespread feeling among Welshmen that there should be a capital of Wales, but views had hitherto been divided on the questionwhich of the Welsh towns should be the capital. Recently, however,a ballot of all the local authorities in Wales had shown a consider-able majority in favour of Cardiff. Most of the Welsh regional offices of Government Departments were already located there; andit would be in accord, both with administrative convenience andwith local sentiment, if Cardiff were now declared to be the capital of Wales. No formal instrument would be required for thispurpose: it would suffice if a statement were made in parliament that the Government were prepared, in deference to opinion throughout the Principality, to recognise Cardiff as the capital of wales. Subject to the Cabinefs views and to The Queen&apos;s pleasure,he proposed to make a statement in those terms in the course of
8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he thought thetime was now opportune to proceed with the introduction of thePensions Increase Bill. If the Cabinet agreed with his view, hewould like to announce the Governments intention in reply to a parliamentary Question on 17th November.The Cabinet -Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would invite the Cabinet to consider, at their first meeting in thefollowing week, the expediency of introducing the pensions increase Bill at an early date.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,10th November, 1955.PemsioEis.(previous reference :CM. (55) 38thConclusions,Minute 9.)the next debate on Welsh affairs, which was likely to be held inthe House of Commons before the end of the year.The Home Affairs Committee had considered this proposal andcommended it for the Cabinefs approval.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary to take The Queen&apos;s pleasureon the proposal that Cardiff should be recognised as thecapital of Wales.(2) Subject to Her Majesty&apos;s approval, authorised the HomeSecretary to make an announcement to this effect in thecourse of the next debate on Welsh affairs.
