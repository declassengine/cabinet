Officials of the Departments concerned should at oncework out the detailed measures which would be required to carryout a policy on the lines now contemplated, including the preparationof drafts of the necessary communications, in particular to theGovernment of India.The President of the Board of Trade said that he and his officialswould co-operate fully in working out the measures which wouldbe called for by a policy on the lines which the group of ministers might recommend, but he might wish to reserve his own positionin respect of such a policy until the matter came before the cabinet for decision.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultation as necessary with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andother Ministers directly concerned, to submit, for con-sideration by the Cabinet at a meeting to be held on12th April, detailed recommendations, for action to help the cotton industry in its present difficulties, with a viewto a Government announcement in the House ofCommons on 20th April.

(55) 95)about the attitude of the United States Government towards the useof nuclear weapons.The Foreign Secretary said that, as would be seen from the telegrams attached to C. (55) 95, President Eisenhower andMr. Dulles were seeking to establish a distinction, on both moral andtechnical grounds, between small and large thermo-nuclear weapons.The Prime Minister and he had agreed that any such distinctionwould be without validity, and that its acceptance would be contraryto the interests of the Western Powers. Subject to the Cabinefsagreement, they proposed that the question should be discussed withthe Canadian Government, who shared our apprehensions about theAmerican attitude, and that agreement should be sought on the termsof a joint communication to the United States Government. Thedraft of this would be submitted to the Cabinet in due course.General agreement was expressed with the views set out inC.
