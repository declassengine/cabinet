Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the first week after the Christmas recess.Two days in that week would be devoted to the Housing SubsidiesBill.The Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Housing hadbeen able to agree with the Opposition Leaders arrangements forcompleting the remaining stages of the Housing Subsidies Bill. Ithad been agreed that four more days, without suspension, should be devoted to completing the Committee Stage, and that the report stage and Third Reading should be completed in two further days.The view was expressed that, although the Foreign secretary had referred in the recent debate on the Middle East to constitutional developments in the Sudan, it might be desirable on constitutionalgrounds for a more formal statement of the present position to bemade in the House of Commons before the recess. The foreign secretary said that, unless on further enquiry any objection might lieagainst one of the co-domini making an independent statement onthe matter at this juncture, he would consider making a formal statement before the House roseThe Cabinet were informed that Government supporters had proposed an amendment to the Teachers&apos; (Superannuation) Bill whichwould allow the proposed increase in superannuation contributions to be postponed until the Burnham Committee had awarded a pay increase.It was pointed out in discussion that it would reflect on theauthority of the Government if they were to accept such an amend-ment, which was not merely undesirable in principle but would prejudice the objective judgment of the Burnham Committee. It was clear, however, that over this Bill the Government were faced withmounting opposition which had its origin in the conviction of the teachers that they were relatively underpaid. It was agreed that,subject to consultation with the Prime Minister, it would be necessaryfor the Cabinet to give further consideration after the recess to theproblems impeding the passage of this Bill.House ofCommonsDisqualification,Mr. C. Beattie,M.P.(previous reference:CM. (55) 44thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Attorney-General said that the Select Committeeappointed to examine the case of Mr. C. Beattie, M.P., had now recommended that Mr. Beattie should be indemnified against anypenalties which he might have incurred for sitting and voting, butthat legislation to validate his election should not be brought in. Itwas desirable that the Government should make an announcement in the House of Commons that afternoon to the effect that they accepted the recommendations of the Select Committee and would,after the recess, take the necessary steps to put them into effect. Itwas probable that three separate acts would be necessary, viz., a motion accepting the conclusion of the Select Committee thatMr. Beattie was disqualified from being a member of the House ofCommons; a motion that a new writ should be issued for the election of a Member for Mid-Ulster; and a Bill of Indemnity.It was recognised in discussion that the issue of a new writ might result in the election for a third time of Mr. Thomas Mitchell or,indeed, of another candidate who was serving a prison sentence forfelony and would therefore be disqualified on election. It would, nodoubt, be possible for steps to be taken through the prison administra-tion to prevent the nomination of such a candidate. It was felt,however, that in spite of the anomaly that a convicted felon could be nominated as a Parliamentary candidate but, if elected, could not sit,any such action would be an improper use of prison authority andwould arouse criticism.The Cabinet Authorised the Attorney-General to make a statement inconnection with the case of Mr. C. Beattie, M.P., in theHouse of Commons that afternoon on the lines he proposed.
Cyprus.,(previous reference :CM. (55) 45thConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Colonial Secretary made a brief report to the Cabineton the present position in Cyprus. He said that he would consult the Foreign Secretary with a view to determining what further action the Governor of Cyprus might be encouraged to take to deal withthe disorders in the Island.The Foreign Secretary said that he had again urged the GreekForeign Minister, whom he had met in Paris on 16th December, thathis Government should inform Archbishop Makarios that it was their view that the formula put forward by the United KingdomGovernment provided a basis for the resumption of discussions between the Archbishop and the Governor. He expected the GreekGovernment to reply to these further representations within a day or two. There was still a chance, albeit a slender one, that theGreek Government could be brought to put some pressure onArchbishop Makarios to resume the discussions. In case thereshould be a resumption, it was desirable to give the Governor of cyprus the fullest guidance and instructions on how to deal withany questions or proposals that the Archbishop might put forward.Until it was clear that the Greek Government were not preparedto bring any such pressure on the Archbishop, it was not desirablethat the formula which we had proposed should be made public.The Prime Minister said that there was little hope that any discussions, if resumed, could lead to an agreement, but nevertheless it would still be to our advantage, for tactical reasons, if the GreekGovernment could be brought to urge the Archbishop to resumediscussions with the Governor.The Prime Minister said that his main anxiety was about the deterioration of the internal situation in Cyprus. The fact that therewas still some slight chance that discussions with the Archbishopmight be resumed ought not to hinder the Governor of Cyprus from introducing any further measures which were necessary to deal withthe disorders. If the Cabinet agreed with this view in principle, the choice between those measures which might be adopted and those to which there would be some objection could be left for the foreign secretary and the Colonial Secretary to decide.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, although it mightnot be possible at the present stage to give Parliament much additional information, it was nevertheless desirable for the Colonial Secretaryto make a statement in the House of Commons on the following dayabout the situation in Cyprus.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Colonial Secretary to make a statement about thesituation in Cyprus in the House of Commons on thefollowing day.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, to decide what further measures mightbe taken by the Governor of Cyprus to deal with thedisorders in the Island.Malta. 4.   The Colonial Secretary said that, in accordance with the(Previous        conclusion reached by the Cabinet at their last meeting, he had sentReference:      a message to the Prime Minister of Malta (Mr. Mintoff) to discourageCM. (55) 46th   him from introducing precipitately in the Maltese Legislature a BillConclusions,    to provide for a referendum.   It then transpired that Mr. MintoffMinute 4.)       had already tabled a dummy Bill on 13th December.  In discussions which had taken place during Mr. Mintoffs short visit to london on 18th December, he had continued to press strongly on him thearguments against holding a referendum before the Parliament at. Westminster had had an opportunity of considering the Report ofthe Round Table Conference, and had advised him to refrain fromhastening the Bill through his Legislature. Mr. Mintoff had, however,

The Cabinet resumed their discussion about the main lines of restrictive legislation to deal with restrictive practices, as proposed in thePractices. memorandum by the Lord Chancellor (CP. (55) 196). They had(Previous before them a further memorandum by the Lord Chancellor (CP.Reference: (55) 209) recommending a revised definition of the justiciable issueCM. (55) 46th which would have to be put to whatever tribunal was entrusted with conclusions,     jurisdiction over restrictive practices.Minute 5.) jjie Lord chancellor said that the Committee of Ministers under his Chairmanship, with the assistance of the Minister of Labour, had considered further how the justiciable issue could best be defined,and they were now all agreed that the definition in the Annex to cp. (55) 209, in addition to being more precise, would also giveindustry an opportunity of putting forward, in defence of a restrictivepractice, any of the arguments which were normally advanced insupport of such practices. This revised definition would no doubt be improved after further consideration by the Committee of Ministers,and would then be submitted at a later stage to the Cabinet for their final approval. In particular, it was desirable to avoid the use ofthe term &quot; substantial unemployment &quot; in clause (1) (/) of the Annex,in order to avoid any impression that workers in an industry had aright to continue to be employed in it irrespective of circumstances.It was only if the removal of a restraint would bring about a drasticmaintained his opinion that, in order to ensure the prospect of asatisfactory majority in favour of the proposal that Malta should berepresented in the United Kingdom Parliament, it was essential thatthe proposed referendum should be held before the beginning ofLent. He had also argued that it would be to the general advantage that the Parliament at Westminster, when debating the Report, should know how the Maltese people had expressed themselves on its main commendation. Mr. Mintoff had therefore decided to go ahead with the proposed legislation, as he was entitled to do, for the mattercame entirely within his jurisdiction. The Bill had already beengiven its Second Reading in the Maltese Legislature and the referendum was due to take place on 8th February. Mr. Mintoffhad, however, agreed to consult him in due course on the form of thequestions to be put in the referendum.It was generally felt in discussion that on further reflectionMr. Mintoffs argument was not altogether unsound and that,although the proposal to hold an early referendum might beconstrued as an attempt to influence the ultimate decision, therewould be advantage in its being known, when the debate took placein the Parliament at Westminster, where the people of Malta stood onthe matter. In the new circumstances it would not be right for the debate to take place before the results of the referendum were known.If the people of Malta were to reject the recommendation that theyshould be represented at Westminster, this recommendation would immediately become a dead letter, and the debate would presumablyconcentrate on the questions of economic assistance and improvedconsultative machinery which were the subject of supportingrecommendations in the Report. A more difficult situation would,however, arise if the referendum were to return only a small ormoderate majority in favour of representation at Westminster; and,to be prepared against such a contingency, it would be necessary forthe Government to decide in advance how large a majority in Malta would constitute the emphatic support for the proposal which mustbe an essential condition of its acceptance.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement.(2) Agreed to consider at an early meeting the Report of the round Table Conference on Malta.
decline in employment in an industry, and if the workers affectedcould not find other employment, that unemployment should providegrounds for justifying a restrictive practice. On this basis some suchphrase as &quot; a drastic decline in the level of activity in an industry&quot;might be included in this section of the definition of the justiciableissue.The Lord Chancellor said that a definition on the lines of thatin the Annex to CP. (55) 209 would, because of its greater precision,be entirely suitable for an independent judicial tribunal, which wasthe form of tribunal favoured by the majority of the Committee ofMinisters.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the proposals to improve the draft of clause (1) (/) of the definition on the lines indicated by the Lord Chancellor. It appeared,however, that some of the sub-clauses of the definition might conflict with each other. It was explained that it would in all cases benecessary to consider separately the balance of advantage to thepublic, and that guidance on the way in which this should be done was contained in clause (2).The Cabinet then considered whether this jurisdiction shouldbe given to ah administrative tribunal or to an independent judicialtribunal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he recognised that anindependent judicial tribunal on the lines of that described in annex III of CP. (55) 196 represented a compromise between an administrative tribunal and the use of the High Court. The objectionwhich he saw to the Governmenfs relinquishing jurisdiction in this field, where decisions could profoundly affect the economy of thecountry, would be partly met if it could be arranged that the definition of the justiciable issue should be re-examined by theGovernment from time to time. It might be possible to provide inthe legislation for the tribunal to request the Government to reconsider the definition of the justiciable issue, or, alternatively, thelegislation might confer power on a Minister to amend the definitionby Order.In discussion it was pointed out that the proposal to conferpower on a Minister to amend legislation by Order was open to serious constitutional objections. The Government would in anycase be under an obligation to keep the definition of the justiciableissue under review. The Foreign Secretary suggested that there washistorical evidence to support the view that the decisions of the judiciary took account of current economic considerations and^tended to be in line with the general economic trends of the time.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion of this point showed that on balancethey were in favour of entrusting jurisdiction over restrictive practicesto an independent judicial tribunal on the lines of that described in annex III of CP. (55) 196.In subsequent discussion the following general points were also raised:  (a) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster suggested that a study should be made of the probable cost of establishing an indepen-dent judicial tribunal to deal with restrictive practices. As well as the running costs of the divisions of the tribunal itself, extra staff wouldbe needed to deal with the registration of restrictive practices andwith the selection of agreements for examination by the tribunal;on the other hand, the establishment of a tribunal might lead to somesaving in the present cost of the Monopolies Commission.(b) It was suggested that it would be opportune to examinerestrictive practices by workers at the same time as legislation was introduced to deal with the restrictive practices of employers.Against this, it was argued that the Government would be in a stronger position to take action against restrictive labour practices ifthey could show that firm action had already been taken to deal withthe restrictive practices of employers.
The Minister of Labour said that the importance of reducingrestrictive labour practices was fully appreciated by both sides ofindustry and steps were already being taken to examine this problem.It was not possible, however, to deal with restrictive labour practices in the same way in which it was proposed to deal with the restrictiveagreements of employers.(c) It was pointed out that it was important to provide thatproceedings before the tribunal could be held in camera, in order tomeet security considerations and to keep valuable trade practicesconfidential.(d) The Minister of Housing said that on issues which inevitablyentailed the appraisal of a balance of economic advantage it would bedifficult for a tribunal to succeed in exercising an effective judisdic-tion, because of the difficulty of defining these issues in judicial terms.The Cabinet realised that the proposed legislation was, in a sense, bound to be experimental. It was an attempt by the Govern-ment to lay down the general line of policy, and at the same time toremove the implementation of that policy in individual cases from thepolitical arena.(e) The Lord Privy Seal said that owing to the state of thefuture legislative programme it might not be possible for the proposed legislation on restrictive practices to become law during the current session of Parliament.The Cabinet-Agreed that the preparation of legislation on restrictive practices should proceed on the basis of a definition of thejusticiable issue on the lines of that in the Annex to CP. (55)209, and on the basis that the jurisdiction over restrictive practices should be entrutsed to an independent judicialtribunal on the lines of that described in Annex III of cp. (55) 196.Road Traffic. 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of20m.p.h. Transport (CP. (55) 201) recommending that the speed limit forSpeed Limit.     heavy goods vehicles should be raised from 20 to 30 miles perhour and seeking authority to make an announcement to this effect at an early date.The Minister of Transport said that, in his view, the mountingpressure both inside and outside Parliament that the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles should be raised could no longer be resisted.In order to avoid defeat on this point in Standing Committee inthe House of Commons on the Road Traffic Bill he had felt obligedto give an undertaking that the matter would be considered. on merits there was nothing to be said for retaining the present speed limit. Although the schedules for lorry drivers were conscientiouslyrelated to a 20 m.p.h. limit, it was the general practice for the driversto travel a great deal faster and to use for their own purposes the time they saved. There had been a great improvement in the brakingefficiency of heavy lorries and road safety would not be prejudiced by raising the speed limit. A large section of the drivers mainlythose engaged on trunk services and haulage work would, however,resist a change which, by permitting the introduction of faster journeyschedules, would take away the perquisite of extra leisure that theywere at present enjoying and it would be necessary to handle thematter carefully for this reason. Following exploratory discussions which he had had in recent months with representatives of some ofthe employers and with the Acting General Secretary of the transport and General Workers&apos; Union, he was satisfied that, to provide a basis for further progress towards the settlement of this problem, it wasnecessary for the Government to announce their intention of raising
8 Ithe speed limit. He would propose, therefore, that a decision shouldbe announced towards the end of January to come into effect inJune. This would provide ample time for the readjustment ofschedules and for the consequent negotiations between the employersand the drivers&apos; union. A decision to raise the speed limit wouldbe welcomed by Chief Constables.Discussion showed that, in agreeing to this proposal, the cabinet were concerned that steps should be taken to ensure that, in contrast to the present speed limit, the new limit would, in fact, be enforced.It was important that the law on this subject should not continue tobe flagrantly and regularly broken. It was agreed that the Cabinefsviews on this aspect of the matter should be brought to the notice ofthe Home Secretary.In further discussion the view was expressed that the attitude ofthe drivers towards the proposed change would depend in part onthe extent to which they shared in the fruits of the increased productivity which would result from the change. It was desirablethat the employers should have this in mind in negotiating newschedules.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Transport to make an announce-ment, as proposed in CP. (55) 201, that the speed limit for heavy goods vehicles would be raised from 20 to 30 milesper hour.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to take note of the views whichhad been expressed in their discussion on the need for amore strict enforcement of the higher speed limit.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20th December, 1955.
