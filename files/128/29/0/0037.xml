1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had discussed further with the Prime Minister whether the abolition of the bread subsidy should form part of the measures which he proposed to announce. He remained of the opinion that the subsidy should be abolished, in order to show that the Government were determined to restrict current as well as capital expenditure. But, in deference to the considerations advanced by the Prime Minister and othermembers of the Cabinet, he would not press his view further. Ifthis chance were not taken, it was not likely that any other early opportunity of abolishing the bread subsidy would arise; it might,however, be abolished in the spring, when budgetary concessionscould perhaps be made to offset the effects of an increase in the priceof bread on those most affected by it. He thought it likely that,even if the bread subsidy were not now abolished, some early increasein National Assistance would be necessary.If the bread subsidy were not now to be abolished, he proposedthat the increase in the rate of tax on distributed profits should belimited to 5 per cent. He had also decided that it would not be worth while to reduce the,foreign travel allowance.The inevitable delay in announcing the Governments measuresto deal with the economic situation had unfortunately meant thatan atmosphere had been created in which the Government^proposals might not be well received. To make up for the absenceof measures to effect a substantial reduction in the Government^current expenditure, he would have to make the most of the savings which would result from the postponement of work on government buildings, and from the reorganisation of Post Office finances. Hewould also have to show that it was not possible, at the present time,to reduce expenditure on defence or on the agricultural subsidies.He trusted that the measures, taken as a whole and having regardto the fact that the price of bread would not be increased, wouldmake it possible for responsible trade union leaders to exercise arestraining influence on wage demands.The following points were raised in discussion:  (a) It would be known early in December whether anapplication would be made for increases in National Assistancerates. The Minister of Pensions said that he could arrange that, ifsuch an application were made, it would not specify the preciseamount of the increases until there had been an opportunity for him to consult the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(b) The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said thatit had been intended that the  2 millions which it would cost to reach a settlement with the small bakers (which would have slightlyincreased their profit margins in order to meet part of the extra costof making a greater proportion of their bread in small loaves) shouldbe offset to the extent of  1 million by increasing the price of thesmall (14 oz.) loaf from A\d. to A\d. If, to his disappointment, the bread subsidy could not now be abolished, it seemed to him that itmight be preferable to avoid making this small increase in the priceof the small loaf at the present juncture. This would mean thatthe Exchequer would have to bear the cost of whatever settlement could be made with the small bakers, until circumstances made it possible, perhaps in about two months time, to increase the priceof the small loaf.The Chancellor of the Exchequer concurred with this view, withwhich the Cabinet were in general agreement.(c) If the question of reducing the agricultural subsidies wereTaised in the economic debate, it could be pointed out that thecurrent estimate was that the annual expenditure on direct subsidiesunder the price guarantees would be-about  35 millions less than inthe last published estimate.EconomicSituation.(previous reference:CM. (55) 36thConclusions,Minute 7.)
The Prime Minister said that, on balance, the delay in introducing the Governments measures to deal with the economicsituation had been justified, since it had enabled the Government toavoid an atmosphere of crisis, and had also given time for sterlingto be strengthened, through the assurances which the Chancellorof the Exchequer had given at the meeting of the international monetary Fund in Istanbul. He thought that the measures uponwhich the Cabinet had agreed would, as a whole, be regarded asequitable and justified.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the measures to meet the current economicsituation should not include the abolition of the bread subsidy.(2) Agreed that the price of the small loaf should not beincreased for the time being.(3) Took note, with approval, of the remaining measures whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed to announceto Parliament on the following day.Cyprus. 2.   The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of Cyprus had(Previous expressed the opinion that the proposed expulsion law, which would reference: give the Government of Cyprus . power of summary deportation,CM. (55) 32nd should be enacted well in advance of any action to be taken under it.Conclusions, The Governor had also sought an assurance that, if the expulsion lawMinute 5.) were enacted, authority for him to take action under it as soon as an offence was committed would not be withheld.The Colonial Secretary said that in his view the expulsion law should not be enacted immediately, since that would prejudice thediscussions which the Foreign Secretary was at present having in Pariswith the Greek Foreign Minister. Those discussions, if successful,might lead to the resumption of the Governors conversations withArchbishop Makarios. Moreover, in view of the speed with whichthe proposed expulsion law could be put into force, he was inclined to think that the law should not be enacted until some offenceoccurred for which its application would be appropriate.The Prime Minister said that he agreed that it would be unwise to enact the expulsion law until the outcome of the Foreign Secretary&apos;present discussions was known. There was, however, something to besaid for enacting the law well in advance of any action to be taken under it, as the Governor proposed, so that fair warning was givento people against whom deportation action might have to be taken.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat a decision to enact the proposed expulsion law should not betaken while the discussions between the Foreign Secretary and theGreek Foreign Minister were in progress. The Governor of Cyprusshould be informed that the Cabinet would consider what guidancecould be given to him on this question as soon as the outcome of theForeign Secretary&apos;s present discussions was known.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to consider the question of an expulsion law furtherwhen the outcome of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s discussions with the Greek Foreign Minister was known.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to inform the Governor of cyprus accordingly.
Egypt.(previous reference:CM. (55) 36thConclusions,Minute 1.)High Dam atAswan.3. The Cabinet resumed consideration, in the light of telegrams which had been received from Washington, of the question of ensuring that the European consortium secured the contract to build theproposed High Dam over the Nile at Aswan.The Prime Minister said that this contract, if it could be securedfor the consortium,. would provide the most effective counterpoisepossible to Russian penetration in Egypt for it would give us acontrolling influence over the Nile waters. The contract would alsoplace us in a strategic position to safeguard our interests in the futureof the Sudan. But it would be essential to act quickly if we were toavoid the risk of the contract slipping through our hands. This risk-might well be serious if we were to become involved in long and difficult negotiations with the International Bank over the question ofinternational tender. He wondered, therefore, whether the right course might not be to broaden the basis of the consortium by a directinvitation to American construction interests to undertake a proportion of the work. Such an approach, with the details left to be worked out, had proved very successful in the case of Persian oil.Alternatively, we should consider whether we and our Europeanpartners could shoulder the financial risks involved without assistanceeither from the United States or from the International Bank. Itwould certainly be dangerous to allow matters to take their coursepending the outcome of a visit which Egyptian negotiators proposedto pay to Washington in mid-November to discuss Egypfs financialneeds with the International Bank, for the contract might in themeantime have been awarded to the Russians.The President of the Board of Trade said that he thought it wouldbe possible eventually to negotiate the participation of american interests in the consortium but it would take time to do so. TheGermans, and not ourselves, had initiated the enterprise. As regardsthe financial burden, the cash payments to be made by Egypt up tothe year 1962 would be covered in large part by her sterling balanceswhich were due to be released. If, however, Egypt proved unable tofind after 1962 the cash resources sufficient to meet the instalmentsdue in the remaining years, there would be a further contingent liability of about  45 millions of which our share would be one-third.The Egyptians themselves were concerned at the margin between their resources and potential liabilities and were seeking financial assistancefrom the International Bank. But it would take time to negotiate anuntied credit of about  50 millions from the International Bank tocover this contingency. If, however, we were prepared to shoulder therisk ourselves he thought there would be a good chance of negotiating with the Egyptians a definite arrangement under which the sterlingreleases were tied to the payments due to the consortium.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would not recommend embarking upon an independent course of action without first informing Mr. Black, the President of the International Bank, ofthe direction in which pur minds were now moving. But Mr. Blackhad not hitherto felt it possible to deviate from the principle ofinternational tender for a project of this kind. He should now beinformed that we were prepared to consider shouldering the financial risks ourselves. We should of course continue our conversations withthe United States Government on Egypfs financial needs generally.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it was a matter of prime importance to secure for the European consortium the early award of the contract for the Egyptian High Dam and that, in order toensure this, it might become necessary for the european governments concerned to underwrite the financial risksthemselves.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be guided by the sense of the Cabinefs discussion in further urgentnegotiations with the International Bank.
Malaya.(previous reference:CM. (55) 30thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Colonial Secretary said that the Chief Minister in malaya, Mr. Tunku Abdul Rahman, had embarked upon a course ofaction which must give grounds for alarm. As the amnestyannouncement of 8th September had failed to achieve any result, theChief Minister felt it necessary that he should go into the foresthimself to hold discussions with Communist leaders. Refusing to bedissuaded from this course, he had at first agreed to refrain at sucha meeting from opening negotiations and from according recognition to the Communist Party, but to confine himself to further explanation of the terms of the amnesty. Later he had taken the view that the amnesty offer had not gone far enough and that he must be allowed,for the purpose of a meeting with the Communist leaders, a mandateto settle the situation as best he could. The High Commissioner, whohad been instructed to remind Mr. Rahman of the undertaking he had given earlier, had replied that he felt that it would be impossible to dissuade the Chief Minister from entering into discussion with theCommunist leaders, and that, if unacceptable conditions were imposed, the Chief Minister might well resign and so place himself in a position to cast the blame upon the Government at home forobstructing a course of action which could be represented as opening up a prospect of bringing the emergency to an end. TheCommissioner-General, South-East Asia, had endorsed this view.The Government of Malaya was not, of course, the responsibility ofthe Chief Minister but of the High Commissioner in ExecutiveCouncil, and the Chief Minister would have to report to the Councilon his return. While it would be open to the Executive Council to reject any agreement or understanding with the Communists into which the Chief Minister had entered, it could be expected that any-such act would precipitate a crisis of first importance. We shouldhave no alternative but to stand firm in such an event and it would be right for us to do so.The Prime Minister supported this view.The Cabinet were informed that Mr. Marshall, the Chief Ministerof Singapore, whose attitude towards Communism was more resoluteand who would therefore have been a strengthening influence at theproposed meeting with Communist leaders, was now reconsideringhis decision to be present.The Cabinet Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement.National 5.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofService. Labour (CP. (55) 149) giving a summary of the results of an enquiry(Previous into the effects of National Service on the education and employmentReferences: of young men. The general conclusion of the enquiry, which had beenCM. (55) 35th undertaken by the Ministry of Labour at the request of the AdvisoryConclusions, Council on Relationship between Employment in the Services and minute 1, and Civilian Life, was that, although National Service inevitably causedCM (55) 34th some disturbance in civilian careers, it did not create any majorConclusions, problems of employment or resettlement.rVlinutc 1 )The Minister of Labour said that publication of the results of theenquiry had been promised in Parliament, and he proposed that thereport of the enquiry should now be published.There was general agreement with this view. The Prime ministers aid that it would be convenient if, in the course of the statement which he was to make to Parliament that afternoon promising a white Paper on National Service, he were to announce that thisreport also would be published.
Canals. 6.   The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the principles(Previous which should be followed in selecting the members of the proposed reference: independent Committee of Enquiry to examine the system of inlandCM. (55) 35th   waterways.Conclusions, It was the general view of the Cabinet that, as the primaryMinute 10.) function of the enquiry would be to create a climate of opinion whichwould enable the Government to make progress towards a solutionof the problem of the canals, a Committee constituted on a widely representative basis would be more effective for this purpose than asmall and independent body. There was a great deal of public anxiety and even some agitation on the subject of canals. Althoughthe amenity and other groups who were interested in preserving the canals might dissent from the conclusions of a Committee of enquiry on which they were represented, it might reasonably be expected thatthe Committee would arrive at majority conclusions which could, infact, form the basis of action by the Government. It was consideredthat, as an alternative, debates in each House of Parliament would notbe an effective means of ventilating all points of view. On the otherhand, it was felt that the proposed Committee, as outlined in theAppendix to CP. (55) 151, might be too large to be effective and that consideration should be given to appointing members in more thanone capacity.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the basis of composition set out in cp. (55) 151 for the independent Committee of enquiry into the system of inland waterways, subject to some reduction in the total numbers of the Committee.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to circulate to the Cabinethis proposals regarding the members to serve on thisCommittee.Summer Time. 7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (55) 150) about an extension of the period of summertime in 1956.The Home Secretary said that in 1954 it had been agreed thatthe circumstances did not warrant invoking the special provisions inthe Summer Time Act, 1947, to allow the normal period of summertime, which was fixed under the Summer Time Acts, 1922 and 1925.to be extended. The special provisions, which varied the dates fixed in the Acts of 1922 and 1925, gave rise to a number of practicaldifficulties, e.g., in connection with railway time-tables. When hehad announced to the House of Commons that summer time wouldnot be extended in 1955, he had stated that the special provisions inthe 1947 Act would not in future be used to effect annual changesin the statutory period of summer time unless there were most exceptional reasons for doing so. Any general public demand forextended summer time was, in practice, directly related to the finenessof the summer: when the weather was indifferent, there was littlepublic interest in an extension of summer time.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Labour to arrange for the early publication of the report of the enquiry into the effects ofNational Service on the education and employment of youngmen; and took note that the Prime Minister would announce the forthcoming publication of this report in the course ofhis statement to Parliament that afternoon promising a white Paper on National Service.
In discussion it was pointed out that farmers, particularlyScottish farmers, raised vigorous objections to an extension ofsummer time, since they could not take full advantage of the earlierhour and consequently might have to pay their workers moreovertime.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the period of summer time should not be extended in 1956.The Cabinet Agreed that the period of summer time should not beextended in 1956.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th October, 1955.
