Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Opposition had asked that a debate on the industrial situation should be held on 23rd June. The Cabinet agreed that this debate might be held on the date suggested, on a motion for the adjournment. The discussion would cover the recent railway strike and other industrial disputes still current, and the subject of the debate could suitably be announced as &quot; Industrial Relations.&quot;A debate on Colonial Affairs was to be held on 21st June. It wasto be hoped that the Opposition would not ask for another day inthe near future to debate the Report of the Royal Commission onEast Africa. The Colonial Secretary said that this was a long andcomplicated report, and it would be some months before theGovernment would be able to define their attitude towards all its recommendations. He would therefore take an opportunity, in the debate on 21st June, to deprecate premature discussion of it.SMpboUding. 2.   The Cabinefs attention was drawn to an announcement thatCargo Liners Shaw Savill had placed orders for the construction of three cargofor Shaw Savill liners by a German shipbuilding firm in Bremen. It had been statedLine. on behalf of the Company that these contracts had been placed inBremen because the German firm had offered a lower price andquicker delivery than any of their British competitors. It was unfortunate that these contracts should be placed abroad at a timewhen there was substantial unemployment in the shipbuilding industry in Northern Ireland.   .The President of the Board of Trade undertook to submit areport to the Prime Minister on this matter, after consultation withthe First Lord of the Admiralty.industrial disputes.Railways.(previous reference:CM. (55) 14thConclusions,Minute 1.)Ocean Liners.(previous reference:CM. (55) 14thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet took note that the proposals which the Ministerof Labour had outlined at their meeting on 14th June had beenaccepted by the two Unions concerned as a basis for the settlementof the railway strike. The Associated Society of locomotive engineers and Firemen had, in particular, agreed to call off the strikewithout waiting until the referee&apos;s award was made known. the strikers had returned to work on 15th June.The Home Secretary said that Departments would need toexercise for a few days longer some of the powers conferred byEmergency Regulations. It was, however, proposed that the proclamation of emergency should be revoked at a meeting of the privy Council on 21st June.The Home Secretary suggested that an appropriate opportunity should be taken to express the Governmenfs appreciation of theefforts of all concerned in maintaining essential services during thestrike and of the patience and good humour shown by the public.The Cabinet were informed that, in his speech that afternoon inthe Debate on the Address, the Chancellor of the Exchequer wouldbe dealing with the economic consequences of the strike; and they agreed that he should include in his speech a suitable reference tothese points.The Cabinet were informed that the Cunard Company had been obliged to cancel the sailing of the Queen Mary, which was to have left Southampton that morning. The deck crew had at the last moment withdrawn their labour in protest against the steps whichthe Company were taking to engage new catering staff in substitution for those who had gone on strike. The Company were considering whether there were grounds for bringing proceedings for incitementagainst some of those who had been responsible for preventing theliner from sailing.
A strike of engine-room staff was likely to prevent the sailingof a Canadian Pacific liner, the Empress of Scotland, from Liverpool.As a result of the action of the Merchant Navy EstablishmentPool, reported at the Cabinet&apos;s last meeting, a small number ofstrikers had reported to the office of the Pool in Liverpool as availablefor duty. The Ministry of Labour were now proceeding to call upfor medical examination men of military age who had been notified-   by the Pool that they were regarded as having left the industry.General. The Prime Minister made a report to the Cabinet on thediscussion about the current industrial situation which he and theMinister of Labour had held on the previous day with representativesof the Trades Union Congress.Monopolies andRestrictivePractices.(previous reference:CM. (55) 12thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of Government policy on monopolies and restrictive practices. In addition to the earlier memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade (CP. (55) 28)outlining his present policy on this question, they now had beforethem a further memorandum by the President (CP. (55) 41) proposing that a comprehensive statement should be made, in reply to questions in the House of Commons, on the further references which he was proposing to make to the Monopolies Commission.The President of :the Board of Trade said that the degree ofpublic interest in this matter was illustrated by the number ofParliamentary Questions which he was due to answer. He proposedthat, instead of answering each of these separately, he should makea comprehensive statement taking account of the past work of the monopolies Commission and announcing his intention to invite theCommission (i) to make a general report on common prices and leveltendering and (ii) to study five specific examples of restrictive practices, viz., supply of steel frames for building, electrical street lighting, tea, chemical fertilisers and electric batteries. The terms ofthe statement which he proposed to make were set out in the annex to CP. (55) 41. By this means he would hope to show that theGovernment were resolved to take vigorous action to identify abusesin this field, through the machinery which Parliament had establised for that purpose. It would be necessary for the Government to showsimilar vigour in taking action to remedy abuses which were revealedby the Commission^ reports. He also hoped to strengthen theCommission by adding to the representation of industrialists on it.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) Tea was included among the proposed references to theCommission because five leading firms, who between them supplieda substantial proportion of the tea consumed in this country, were operating a system of common prices. It was possible that it wouldbe found, on examination, that this system did not operate againstthe public interest. But it was desirable that the facts should be clearly established. And it was expedient that the list of references to the Commission should include at least one article which was of direct interest to consumers.(b) Some doubt was expressed about the expediency of asking the Commission to investigate the marketing of chemical fertilisersin this country. These were produced by two firms, imperial chemical Industries and Fisons Ltd. Both were highly efficient firms,which had expanded their production in furtherance of theGovernments . agricultural policy, and at an earlier stage theEconomic Policy Committee had thought it unnecessary that this aspect of their business should be investigated by the monopolies commission. The point was also made that the production of chemical fertilisers was only one part of the business carried on by imperial Chemical Industries; that the firm undertook a substantial
amount of expensive research and development which was of generalbenefit to the national economy; and that it was unreasonable to ask the Monopolies Commission to pass judgment on the way in whichthe firm adjusted the prices of its various products in order to defraythe cost of this research.On the other hand it was pointed out that there was some feeling among farmers that these firms were making excessive profitsfrom fertilisers. The Government subsidy on fertilisers had recentlybeen increased. It was known that during the next few months theprices of fertilisers would be raised. The criticism was certain to bemade that a large part of the subsidy, which had been intended toassist farmers, was finding its way into the pockets of the manufacturers. And, that being so, it was better that the monopolies commission should be asked to look into this matter before, ratherthan after, the prices were raised.The balance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of referringthis question to the Monopolies Commission. The two firms should,however, be informed before the announcement was made.(c) The President of the Board of Trade said that he wasdiscussing with the industry means of giving effect to therecommendations of the Monopolies Commission in their Reporton Calico Printing. He hoped to be able to secure their voluntaryacceptance of the proposals which he was putting to them. In default of agreement, however, an Order would have to be made underSection 10 of the Monopolies Act, 1948.(d) No opportunity should be lost of making it clear that it wasthe duty of the Monopolies Commission to establish whether aparticular restrictive practice operated against the public interest.The decision to refer a practice to the Commission did not, therefore,involve any stigma on the firm or firms concerned: it did notprejudge the question whether or not the practice was contrary tothe public interest.The President of the Board of Trade said that this point was clearly made in the final paragraph of the draft statement annexed to CP. (55) 41. He would do his utmost to ensure that prominencewas given to it in the Press.(e) There was much misunderstanding about the nature ofGovernment policy on monopolies and restrictive practices. It wasin fact a fertile field for misrepresentation. It would be useful if further public discussion could be stimulated with a view to clarifyingthe issues and removing some of the misconceptions about government policy. Literature on the subject might be issued bythe Conservative Party Headquarters. The B.B.C. might also beasked to arrange for some talks on the subject to be broadcast.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to make that afternoon, in reply to Questions in the House ofCommons, a statement on the work of the monopolies commission in the terms of the draft annexed to cp. (55) 41.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, for further publicity on the problem ofmonopolies and restrictive practices with a view toclarifying the issues involved and removingmisconceptions about Government policy.(3) Took note that the President of the Board of Trade would continue his efforts to persuade the industry voluntarilyto give effect to his decisions on the monopolies commission^ Report on Calico Printing, but would refer to the Cabinet again if it became necessary to considerenforcing those decisions by an Order under the monopolies Act, 1948.
CivilAviation.Developmentof gatwick airport.(previous reference :C.C. (54) 63rdConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofTransport (CP. (55) 38) and the Secretary of State for Air(CP. (55) 39) on the question of technical responsibility for the civil engineering work to be undertaken in the construction of gatwick airport.The Minister of Transport said that the preliminary engineeringwork had been undertaken on his behalf by the Works Departmentof the Air Ministry. The work was now approaching the stage atwhich tenders should be invited from contractors, and he had been considering how responsibility could best be assigned for drawing up detailed specifications for tendering, examining estimates of costand supervising contracts. The possible courses were to rely whollyon the Works Department of the Air Ministry: to rely wholly onoutside consultants: or to invite proposals from both the WorksDepartment of the Air Ministry and one or more consultants andto decide how the work should be allotted between them in the lightof the relative cost and suitability of their proposals. For the reasons give in his memorandum he would prefer to follow the third ofthese courses.The Secretary of State for Air said that he could not accept theprocedure proposed by the Minister of Transport. The ultimatetechnical responsibility for the design and construction of the airfieldshould in his view be assigned to a single authority either to hisWorks Department or to an outside consultant. This was speciallynecessary at Gatwick because of the difficulties of the site. Ifresponsibility were divided, as proposed by the Minister of Transport,there was risk of friction and confusion.In support of the proposal that the advice of outside consultantsshould be obtained, the following arguments were put forward. Thedecision to build the Gatwick Airport had already been the subjectof public controversy, and it was specially necessary that the responsible Minister should be able to satisfy Parliament and thepublic that every possible precaution had been taken to ensure success and to avoid extravagance in its construction. Design of civil airportswas tending to diverge from that of military airfields, in theconstruction of which the main experience of the Works Departmentof the Air Ministry lay. Civil engineering firms were alreadyconstructing international airports abroad and it was desirable, inthe national interest, that their experience of this work should bebroadened. Private engineering firms were able to secure the servicesof men of higher technical attainments than those usually found inWorks Departments in the public service; and, on a constructionalproject of this magnitude, the Government should not deprivethemselves of this skilled advice.On the other side it was recognised that there were advantages in preserving undivided technical responsibility for a project of thiskind. The course proposed by the Minister of Transport was open tothe objection that it would involve duplication of effort and additional cost in fees. It also seemed wasteful not to make full use of theexperience gained by the Works Department of the Air ministry in the construction of runways and perimeter tracks which was common both to civil and to military airfields.On the other hand, in view of the special difficulties of constructing an airport on the Gatwick site, it seemed prudent thatthe Government should be able to say, if difficulties or unforeseenexpenditure occurred, that they had not relied wholly on official advisers but had also sought the advice of private consultants. Ifthe procedure suggested by the Ministry of Transport was not acceptable to the Air Ministry, a possible alternative might be to assign the general responsibility to the Works Department Of theAir Ministry but to require them to invite tenders from private firmsfor particular parts of the work. Another alternative would be that,while final responsibility rested with the Air Ministry, they shouldbe required to seek advice from private consultants at various stages in the completion of the work.
6. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Foreign Secretary(CP. (55) 35) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (55) 36)about an Anglo-American plan for the settlement of the dispute between the Arab States and Israel.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that this plan was summarised in an earlier memorandum by the former foreign secretary (C. (55) 96). The Foreign Secretary was now seeking authority to co-operate with the United States Government in anattempt, through discussions with the Egyptian Prime Minister andsubsequently with the other parties to the dispute, to bring about asettlement on the basis proposed in that memorandum. During his visit to New York he would try to persuade Mr. Dulles that it wouldbe unwise at this stage to publish the plan, as Mr. Dulles at present contemplated.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the present stateof our balance of payments we should not really be justified in providing Israel with the financial assistance which the plan involved.It would be difficult to explain our action to other would-be borrowers Commonwealth, Colonial or foreign to whom we had felt obligedto refuse or restrict access to the London capital market. Provided,however, that he had reasonable assurance that we should not find that we had given Israel assistance without, in fact, securing asettlement of outstanding issues between her and the Arab States,he would be reluctantly prepared to co-operate on the lines proposed,although he wished to consider further whether the proposed loanshould not be for a smaller amount. He also hoped that we shouldtake no initiative in offering the Israelis special facilities for raisingmoney in London.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the foreign secretary wished to be in a position to meet any request from the Israelies that they should be granted facilities for raising money inthis country. He did not, however, regard facilities for the sale of israel Government bonds as an essential feature of the plan, andwould be content with the grant to the Israel Government of permission to raise up to  15 millions on the London market as suggested in paragraph 8 of C. (55) 96. If the proposed plan wereshorn of its financial features, it was unlikely to succeed. Theproportion of the estimated cost of the plan which was to be borneby the United Kingdom Government corresponded to our proportionof present expenditure on Arab refugees through the United NationsRelief and Works Agency.Palestine.(previous reference:CM. (55) 14thConclusions,Minute 7.)Further discussion showed that the Secretary of State for Airwas unwilling to accept any procedure which had the result that thetechnical responsibility would be shared in any way between hisWorks Department and outside consultants. The Minister ofTransport, on the other hand, who had ultimate ministerial responsibility for the project, was unwilling to rely wholly on theWorks Department of the Air Ministry. In these circumstances theCabinet agreed that the only practicable course was for the Ministerof Transport to rely for this purpose wholly on outside consultantsand to relieve the Works Department of the Air Ministry of all further responsibility for the construction of this airport.The Cabinet Agreed that the Works Department of the Air ministry should be relieved of all further responsibility in connectionwith the construction of Gatwick Airport, and that theMinister of Transport should arrange for the further workon the Airport to be carried out by private firms on theadvice of consulting engineers.
There was support in the Cabinet for the view that the grant tothe Israel Government of the right of access to the London market for the raising of some of the capital which they would have toprovide under the plan would be preferable to the proposed arrangements for the sale here of Israel Government bonds. TheCommonwealth Secretary said, however, that he would like theopportunity of commenting upon any specific proposal for the grantof such access.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the plan described in C. (55) 96 and cp. (55) 35 for promoting a settlement of the dispute between the Arab States and Israel.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss further with the Foreign Secretary the form and scale of thefinancial assistance which the United KingdomGovernment should accord to the Israel government under the plan.Administrative        7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeTribunals.       Minister (CP. (55) 43) about a case in which the Minister ofEducation had confirmed a compulsory purchase order in respect ofland at Oxshott, Surrey, for the purpose of the building of a school.The Prime Minister said that this case had been fully investigatedand he was satisfied that in all the circumstances the compulsory purchase order ought not to be disturbed. The case had, however,served to emphasise the urgency of proceeding with the enquirypromised in The Queen&apos;s Speech into practice and procedure inrelation to administrative tribunals and quasi-judicial enquiries,including those concerning land.The Lord Chancellor said that he hoped to submit proposals on this matter at an early date.The Cabinet Took note of CP. (55) 43 and of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16 th June, 1955.
