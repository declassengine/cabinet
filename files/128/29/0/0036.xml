Foreign Affairs.Far East.(previous reference:CM. (55) 26thConclusions,Minute 4.).1. The Foreign Secretary reviewed the situation in the Far East.There had been a relaxation of tension in the area of the FormosaStraits, and it was encouraging that the Russians had not availedthemselves of the opportunity of creating difficulties over the failureof Viet Nam to implement the Geneva Agreements. Admittedlythere had also been breaches of these Agreements in Laos. ThoughDiem had again repudiated any obligation under these Agreements,he had now taken certain steps which could be represented as constituting a reply to Viet Minh on the question of elections todetermine the future of the two countries. In the meantime, Diemhad arranged for elections within Viet Nam, mainly in order tostrengthen his own position and for this he had been denounced bythe Emperor, Bao Dai.It had been felt that celebrations which were being organised inMacao in honour of the fourth centenary of Portuguese occupationmight provoke hostile reactions from China with consequentrepercussions for Hong Kong. It had therefore been suggested to thePortuguese Government that the scope of these celebrations might belimited.No progress had been made in persuading the ChineseNationalists to hand over Chou Chu, who was wanted in connectionwith the bomb explosion in the Indian aircraft carrying passengersto the Bandung Conference. The Chinese Nationalists had repliedthat there was no legal ground for our request since no treaty ofextradition existed. Our Consul was being instructed to make afurther request to the Chinese Nationalists for the release of ChouChu pointing out the adverse effect on world opinion of their continued refusal to hand him over. The American State department was also being asked to exert pressure on the Chinese Nationalists.In discussion the Cabinet agreed that it was important tocontinue to press for the handing over of Chou Chu. Quite apartfrom our interest in establishing responsibility for this incident, whichmight have had far more serious consequences, the continued detention of certain witnesses who were being held in Hong Kong totestify in the trial of Chou Chu was causing difficulty. In the approach to the Americans the point should be made that a failure on their part to bring pressure on the Chinese Nationalists for therelease of Chou Chu would adversely affect world opinion. this might react against them when the question of Chinese representa-tion in the United Nations next came up for consideration.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.Middle East.(previous reference:CM. (55) 34thConclusions,Minute 8.)The Foreign Secretary said that in the Middle East the russians had clearly embarked on a deliberate policy of opening up anotherfront in the cold war. It would be wrong, however, to be toodespondent about the position. The Suez Treaties had created avacuum in the Middle East and it was a common reaction for a nation which had been controlled by another for a period to turnagainst it on first obtaining freedom. This initial reaction might beexpected to give place eventually to a more balanced view. In themeantime we should adopt a policy of moderation in our dealings with Egypt and we should endeavour to persuade the Americans todo the same. We should concentrate on helping other Arab states who behaved loyally, while at the same time demonstrating that therewere limits to the extent to which we could be provoked.The Prime Minister said that the main objective of our policy should be to protect our vital oil interests in the Middle East.  From
The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the statements on Middle Eastpolicy made by the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary.(2) Agreed with the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequerrecorded in paragraph (b) above for handling the financing of the High Aswan Dam project.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to emphasise to M. Molotovat the forthcoming Meeting of Foreign Ministers the dangers inherent in an arms race in the Middle East.this point of view the strengthening of the Northern Tier defence arrangements was more important than the attitude of Egypt.Turkey was the pivot to the Northern Tier defence. This factorshould be kept in mind in all considerations of the Cyprus question.It must be admitted that Egypt had not received any large suppliesof arms from the United Kingdom and some of the supplies whichhad been approved for release had been held up through lack ofagreement in the Near East Arms Co-ordinating Committee. In viewof Nasser&apos;s dependence on the support of the Army in Egypt, his decision to accept the Soviet offer was understandable if regrettable.But Persia&apos;s adherence to the Bagdad Pact, although not of militarysignificance, could be held to offset this decision in completing thechain of protection across the route to the oil. The allocation ofthe Egyptian High Aswan Dam project to the European consortium,if it could be secured, would be of immense value in restoring the prestige of the West and particularly of the older European powers in the Arab world generally. In our dealings with Egypt it couldbe a trump card.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) A policy of attempting to reduce tension in the Middle Eastby limiting the supply of arms could only succeed if the Middle EastStates could not obtain supplies from countries who were notsignatories of the Tripartite Declaration of 1950.(b) It was the normal practice of the International Bank torequire international tenders for any project which they supported;and the risk that this procedure might result in the High Damcontract being let to a Russian or satellite firm could not be excluded.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he recognised the political advantages of this project being undertaken by the Europeanconsortium. He was concerned, however, about the size of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s commitment. In view of the interest of theInternational Bank in the matter it would be advisable, before anyfurther steps were taken, to consult with the United StatesGovernment with a view to securing their support for a policy withregard to international tender which would be acceptable to theBank. In its present context such an approach might also resultin getting further direct American support for the Egyptian economy.(c) It would be necessary at some point to consult with theFrench and German Governments about the proposed arrangementsfor the High Dam project, but this should be deferred until further progress had been made with the International Bank.Summing up, The Prime Minister said that at the forthcoming meeting of Foreign Ministers in Geneva the Foreign Secretary shouldtake the opportunity of impressing on M. Molotov the dangers ofthe recent Russian moves in the Middle East, which would upset the delicate balance in military strength which the Western powers had been endeavouring to maintain in this area of tension. Therewas a real danger that war might break out between Israel and egypt in which the Americans would be likely to support Israel. Oncesuch a war had started it might well spread into a world-wide conflict.
In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It would be difficult for Spain to qualify for membership of the O.E.E.C. unless she could increase significantly the very small proportion of her import trade which was at present liberalised.(b) While it should be made clear to the Spanish authorities in discussion that we had no intention of relinquishing Gibraltar, theprospects of success for our policies would not be enhanced if theproposed approach to the Spanish Government were preceded by apublic declaration to that effect.(c) It was understood that all the labour needed to maintainGibraltar could be housed on the Rock if a further 2,000 homescould be provided. If this could be done and the permanent labour force in Gibraltar appropriately strengthened it would not benecessary to rely upon daily labour from the mainland. The colonial secretary undertook to enquire further into this question.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations contained in the memo-randum attached to CP. (55) 147.(2) Agreed that no public statement of our intentions with regardto the sovereignty of Gibraltar should be made in advanceof the proposed approach to the Spanish Government.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to circulate a memorandum onthe point recorded in paragraph (c) above.Spain. 2.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Foreign Secretary(Previous (CP. (55) 147) covering a memorandum on our relations with Spain.Reference: 1 It was recommended in the memorandum that we should seekCM. (55) 16th to bring about a progressive improvement in our relations with SpainConclusions, by supporting her applications for membership of the United NationsMinute 8.) and (assuming that difficulties over qualification were overcome)of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.).We should explain to the Spanish Government that these decisions had been taken in the belief that closer association of Spain with theeconomic and political life of the free world was desirable and would lead to an improvement in Anglo-Spanish relations. But we should at the same time invite them to re-examine their regulations affectingGibraltar and make it clear that, while we were not seeking to strike a bargain, no policy designed to improve Anglo-Spanish relationscould in fact succeed while abnormal restrictions at the Gibraltarfrontier continued. We should also consider sympathetically anyeventual Spanish request for admission to the Council of Europe,but the balance of advantage lay against any move to bring Spaininto the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation at present. We should inform the United States Government of this policy.The Cabinet also had before them a note by the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (55) 157) setting outopinions expressed on relations with Spain by political leaders in gibraltar during the recent visit of the Colonial Secretary.The Colonial Secretary said that he supported the proposals in cp. (55) 147, notwithstanding the attitude still maintained by theSpanish Government over Gibraltar. If the Spanish authorities could not be induced to modify their frontier restrictions, Gibraltarwould be deprived entirely of Spanish labour from the mainlandwithin ten or fifteen years. He agreed, however, that it would be a mistake to attempt to bargain our support of Spanish candidaturefor membership of international organisations against the removalof the frontier restrictions. Political opinion in Gibraltar supported this view. But he felt strongly that there should be no room fordoubt about our intention to retain sovereignty over Gibraltar andthat we should create a suitable opportunity for making a public declaration to that effect.
United Nations.Admission ofNew Members.(previous reference:CM. (55) 31stConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (55) 158) recommending that, subject to the additionof Spain to the list, we should now support the Canadian proposal that an understanding should be reached with the Soviet Governmentfor the admission of seventeen new members to the United Nations.The Foreign Secretary recalled the previous discussion of thismatter in the Cabinet on 15th September. The Canadian proposal,which provided for the admission to the United Nations of virtually all possible applicants, except divided States, would create as well assolve problems, and he had hoped that the proposal might have been abandoned, if only because of the objection of the United States tothe admission of certain Eastern European countries and OuterMongolia. Nevertheless, it appeared that the Canadians were likelyto insist on putting their proposal forward and the Russians had now given an indication that they would be prepared to agree to the admission of both Spain and Japan. In these circumstances, for thereasons given in his memorandum, it became desirable that we should now support the Canadian proposal. Apart from our direct interestin securing the admission of such well-qualified States as Italy, finland and Portugal, it was certainly not in our interests that Ceylon, togetherwith other Asian and African candidates, should be given grounds for holding that we had obstructed their admission.The Colonial Secretary said that, while he did not dissent fromthese conclusions, he must warn his colleagues that the admission ofall the countries in the list would almost certainly lead to a completechange in the balance of voting in the United Nations on colonialissues. In his view, we should not thereafter be able to mobilisesufficient support to prevent, on grounds of non-competence, theinscription on the United Nations agenda of questions relating to ourown overseas territories. We should then be left with no alternative but to withdraw from the discussion of colonial issues inscribed on theagenda against our will. This would not be a satisfactory situation.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, notwithstanding theprobable consequences which the Colonial Secretary had outlined, thebalance of advantage must now lie in supporting the Canadianproposal.The Cabinet Approved the recommendation in paragraph 5 of cp. (55) 158 on the admission of new members to the united nations.The Saar.(previous reference:CM. (55) 21stConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (55) 159) on the possible consequences of theforthcoming referendum in the Saar.The Foreign Secretary said that the referendum was due to beheld on 23rd October. If its outcome were favourable the Saar would achieve a European status, linked with Western European Unionunder a Commissioner responsible for foreign affairs, defence andcertain internal functions. (In this event there might well be a request for the nomination of a British Commissioner.) If, however, therewere an adverse vote the Franco-German Agreement of October 1954,would fall to the ground; legally the Saar would then revert to theposition of French occupied territory with France responsible for itsdefence and for the representation of its interests abroad. In realitythe situation would be one in which the majority of the Saarpopulation would be opposed to their Government and would be without any means of constitutional self-expression until 1957, sinceHerr Hoffman, the present Prime Minister, had declared that if theStatute were rejected his Government would not hold further electionsuntil the end of the present Landtag&apos;s normal term.
Though the French were confident of a positive vote, otherobservers considered that a negative majority was more likely. Theattitude of the French had prevented the sending of an internationalpolice force into the Saar so that, if any disturbances now broke out,French troops would probably be used to restore order. This wouldcertainly have an inflammatory effect on Franco-German relations,and it would be particularly unfortunate for such events to occur atthe start of the Meeting of Foreign Ministers at Geneva. He suggestedtherefore that in the event of an adverse vote the United kingdom should take the initiative in trying to find some legal means ofproviding for the Saar the benefits which would have resulted had theStatute been adopted, and of ensuring adequate safeguards fordemocratic principles in the Saar, such as preventing the suppression of pro-German parties and newspapers and providing for free elections to a new Landtag at the earliest possible date.In discussion the Cabinet agreed on the importance of urgingrestraint on the French in the event of an adverse vote on the Saarreferendum. The result would be known while the Western foreign ministers were meeting in Paris before the Geneva Conference andif necessary a personal message might be sent to M. Faure by thePrime Minister.The Cabinet-Endorsed the proposals put  forward by the foreign secretary in CP. (55) 159.5. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had discussed with the other Ministers concerned the policy to be pursued by the Foreign Secretary at the Meeting of Foreign Ministers whichwas due to open at Geneva on 27th October.On the main issue of the relationship between European security and German unity, it would be right that the offer of a Security Pactshould contain guarantees for the Russians; but any concessions weoffered should only be made in return for, and at the same time asprogress was made towards, German reunification. There would be full agreement between the Western Powers on this policy.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Disappearance        6.   The Cabinet were informed that the Labour Opposition had of two Foreign been told that the Government were prepared to have a debate asService Officers, soon as possible on the questions arising out of the disappearance of(Previous the two Foreign Service officers, Burgess and Maclean. In discussingReference: the line to be taken by Government spokesmen in the debate, the cm. (55) 35th Cabinet considered  the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal  that  theConclusions, Government should offer to hold a public enquiry on the conditionsMinute 1.) set out in his memorandum CP. (55) 161.The Foreign Secretary said that there was strong pressure from several quarters for some form of enquiry. He was convinced thatthere was nothing to be said for holding an inquest into the past.This would give currency to a stream of false and misleadingstatements which could never be overtaken and corrected in the public mind. But he saw certain positive advantages in an enquiry directed to examine what further safeguards were needed to ensure the securityof national interests in the future.This problem went further than the security of documents andthe loyalty of officials. Even now it was possible for Communistlabour leaders to penetrate, in the course of trade union business,into establishments where secret work of the highest importance wasbeing carried on. There was therefore a security question in relationFour-power talks.
to certain secret establishments. Moreover, in regard to theemployment of Government officials generally, there might be needfor further powers or a clearer definition of the powers available andthe circumstances in which they could be exercised.Secondly, much of the criticism of the failure to prevent breaches of security in the past implied a criticism of the law as it stood.Additional safeguards could only be furnished if the law were firstamended, and an enquiry would bring out into the open the essentialconflict which lay between security and individual freedom.In discussion the following points were made: - (a) If an enquiry were held, it would be difficult to limit it tothe question of ensuring security in the future. An attempt wouldbe made to hold an inquest, not merely into the breaches of security which had occurred, but into circumstantial matters of the conductof individuals and the reasons for their continued employment.(b) The Home Secretary said that any tribunal of enquiry would wish to carry out some examination into the working of the security service. He therefore saw considerable objection to a tribunalconstituted on the lines proposed by the Foreign Secretary and containing, e.g., representatives of industry and the trade unions. Hewould prefer that, if there was to be an enquiry, it should be conducted by a small body of Government and Opposition leaders.(c) The question of publicity would also present a dilemma. for only a public enquiry would satisfy public opinion, but this would throw a spotlight on a number of matters which might prejudicefuture security. For example, it was not desirable to give publicity to the limited degree of security which could at present be exercisedat industrial establishments.(d) It might be possible to consider requiring people engaged on secret work to give an undertaking not to leave the country without permission. Such an undertaking could not, however, be enforcedwithout the power of arrest. A previous enquiry had shown that newpowers would have to be taken to prevent a suspect, whether he had given such an undertaking or not, from leaving the country.(e) Public opinion was notoriously uncertain on this kind of issue.The House of Commons, as experience had recently shown in the debates on the Atomic Energy Bill, were extremely reluctant toprovide the Government with powers which departed in any way from the traditional principles of English law.(/) It was suggested that the broader purposes of an enquiry would be achieved if the Government were to state in debate the dilemma which the security problem presented and invite theOpposition and the House to consider what solution would be generally acceptable to public opinion.The Prime Minister said that at the heart of this matter lay thequestion of the suitability of the machinery of a public enquiry foran investigation which would be concerned with the fundamental principles of our national life. If, in our concern for security, it was now necessary to probe deeply into these issues, it was for parliament itself to conduct the enquiry and to reflect public opinionon the dilemma which the issues presented. It would be wrongtherefore to offer to set up a public tribunal of enquiry. If, in thecourse of debate, it became clear that the House felt need for thekind of assurance, especially on the working of the Security Service,which a private enquiry might yield, the Government could considerproposing a confidential enquiry by Government and opposition leaders.The Cabinet (1) Decided that pressure for a public enquiry of any kind shouldbe resisted in the forthcoming debate in the House ofCommons, and that the Government should make no offer of an independent enquiry of the kind proposed in cp. (55) 161.
EcomonaicSituation.(previous references:CM. (55) 35thConclusions,Minute 1, and cm. (55) 34thConclusions,Minute 6.)General.7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet ofthe measures which he proposed to announce to the House ofCommons on 26th October.As regards expenditure by local authorities, he said that theterms of the circular (set out in CP. (55) 156) which would be sent toreach local authorities on the day following his statement had beenagreed with the Ministers concerned. He would also announce thenew arrangements for capital finance for local authorities, asproposed in his memorandum CP. (55) 131. He would indicate inhis speech, the relevant parts of which would be shown to the ministers concerned, the extent to which particular sectors of expenditure wouldnot, in the Government^ view, fall to be included in the review which local authorities would make.He would also describe what reduction in expenditure would beachieved by restricting the investment plans of certain nationalised industries, such as gas and electricity, and, to a smaller degree, coal.Although it could be claimed that since 1951 there had been a significant reduction in the proportion of the national product devotedto Government expenditure, it would be difficult to show that theGovernment would be making any further substantial reduction intheir direct expenditure. The immediate saving through the reductions in the rates of housing subsidy would not be large. he proposed to announce that work would be held up on certainGovernment buildings (i.e., the new Colonial Office, the offices inHorseferry Road, and the Embassy building in Washington), and hewould also mention the saying which would result from there organisation of Post Office finances. But, failing some such stepas a reduction in the number of teachers or the imposition of furthercharges under the National Health Service, a substantial reductionin Government expenditure could only be obtained if the bread subsidy were to be abolished.To encourage savings, he would mention the new Defence Bondissue, and would announce an increase in the maximum permissibleholding of Savings Certificates.He was doubtful whether, on balance, the foreign travel allowance should be reduced to  75. In many ways this would be a retrograde step, but there would be some direct saving of foreign currency, andit might be psychologically valuable as a balance to other measures.The adjustments he proposed to make in the purchase tax, which included alterations in the rates of tax on textiles, with an increaseof one-fifth in the general rates of tax and inclusion of domesticutensils, would yield  75 millions. These adjustments would be of constructive value, since by abolishing the &quot; D &quot; scheme, and bringingsilverware and cut glass into a different category, they would helpexports.He also proposed to announce an increase in the rate of tax ondistributed profits. It was for consideration whether the rate shouldbe increased from 22-J per cent, to 27^ per cent, (which would yield 38 millions) or to 30 per cent, (which would yield  57 millions).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that all these measures,in addition to the credit restrictions already introduced, would showthat the Government were determined to maintain the strength of sterling by restraining excessive demand, due to both investment and consumption.In discussion it was argued that the inflationary pressure was due to too much investment, and not only to too much consumption.There was excessive demand particularly on the machine-tool and(2) Agreed that further consideration should be given to thedesirability of a confidential enquiry, to be conducted by government and Opposition leaders, should the course ofthe debate indicate that such an enquiry would serve a useful purpose in reassuring public opinion.
bpheavy engineering industries, with the result that manufacturers inthese industries were discouraged from exporting, even though therewere valuable overseas markets available, such as Canada. On these grounds, a case could be made out for abolishing the investmentallowance which was instituted in 1954. On the other hand, private industry was already subject to the credit restrictions; and it wouldbe unwise to withdraw the investment allowance which had been introduced so recently or to take further measures to cut investment by private industry, since this would have the effect of hindering our export industries from renewing their factories and equipment.As regards the foreign travel allowance, the view was expressed that a reduction to  75 would not prevent many people from continuing to travel. This measure, although of no great financialconsequence, would show that the Government disapproved of unnecessary spending abroad.Bread Subsidy.        The Cabinet again reviewed the arguments for and against theabolition of the bread subsidy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the subsidy waseconomically indefensible, and that its removal would be taken as a sign that the Government were determined to check inflation. Thiswould materially assist in maintaining foreign confidence in sterling.Moreover, only by checking inflation could the Government hope tohalt the continuing increase in wages. The effects on the poorersections of the community of removing the subsidy could be offset by some increase in National Assistance.The Minister of Labour said that, if the bread subsidy were notabolished, it could be hoped that, despite the effect of the other measures on the cost of living, responsible trade union leaders would help to restrain the pressure for higher wages. But an increase in theprice of bread would make the Governments proposals, taken as awhole, unacceptable to organised labour, who would be united in pressing not only the wage claims that were at present underconsideration, but further claims as well. There would be a grave danger of a serious deterioration in industrial relations&apos; during thecoming winter.The Minister of Pensions said that if the subsidy were abolishedsome increase in National Assistance, which might otherwise beavoidable, would become necessary. If this increase were one of. 6d. a week it would cost  13 millions a year, but the increase mighthave to be as much as 5s. a week. The abolition of the subsidy would not only mean that expenditure on National Assistance wouldbe substantially increased, but that the number of people receivingassistance, which had been falling this year, would again rise. Thiswould not be helpful from the point of view of confidence. In hisopinion it would be wrong for measures to reduce consumption to bedirected against essentials such as bread.In discussion, it was suggested that, as the bread subsidy was generally recognised to be undesirable, the present would be the besttime to abolish it. The other measures contemplated would in anycase provide plenty of arguments for claims for higher wages, andthe addition of an increase in the price of bread would not be material in this respect. On the other hand, it was argued that it would be easier to remove the bread subsidy at a time when concessions whichwould compensate most of the people affected could be made; anincrease in National Assistance would only provide for the poorestsections of the community. It would be wrong, at a time when therehad been recent price increases, as on coal, and when other measureswhich would increase the cost of living were to be introduced, toincrease the price of bread also.The Prime Minister said that the measures which the government proposed to deal with the economic situation would be acceptable to
the country if they were thought to be equitable. An increase in theprice of bread would undoubtedly be represented as unfair, and might indeed be regarded as unjustified. He was concerned with the effect which such a step would have on wage negotiations and industrial relations. He would therefore like to discuss this measure further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, taking into account the views expressed by the Cabinet.Rent Control. In connection with the announcement of the measures to dealwith the economic situation, the Cabinet had before them amemorandum by the Minister of Housing (CP. (55) 160) suggesting the terms in which, in stating the Governments policy on housing subsidies, he proposed to refer to the problem of rent control.The Prime Minister said that he felt that any reference to rent control should not imply that the Government had decided that changes in the existing system should be made.There was general agreement with this view, and it was decidedthat this reference should be as follows &quot; The Government recognise that the level of rents of council houses and that of comparable privately-owned houses are inter-related. It is therefore necessary to review the whole structure of the Rent Acts. We shall announce our conclusions in due course.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of theExchequer would consider further the question of theabolition of the bread subsidy, in the light of the views expressed in the Cabinefs discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to inform them attheir next meeting of his final proposals concerning the bread subsidy, the foreign travel allowance, and the rate of tax on distributed profits.(3) Invited the Minister of Housing to include in his announce-ment about the housing subsidies the reference to rent control approved in the Cabinefs discussion.Cabinet Office, SAY. 1,21st October, 1955.
