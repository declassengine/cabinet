1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (55) 121) reporting the conclusions of theCommittee of Ministers over which he had presided on the procedure to be followed at the forthcoming round-table Conference on Malta,and setting out the considerations which would have to be taken intoaccount in formulating the attitude to be adopted by representativesof the Government at the Conference.The Lord Chancellor said that he had ascertained that theLeaders of the Opposition who would be members of the conference were generally in agreement with his procedural proposals.Mr. MintofT had, however, intimated during a courtesy call, no doubtbecause it would tend to diminish the importance of his own leadingposition as Prime Minister, that he hoped the number of independentMaltese called to give evidence would be very much restricted.Mr. Mintoff was also not in favour of the proposal that theConference should at an appropriate stage pay a visit to the Island.The decisions on both these matters would, of course, have to betaken by the Conference itself.In view of the complexity of the problem, it was felt desirablethat Her Majesty&apos;s Government should place before the conference a full and objective statement of the considerations constitutional,strategic and financial which it would be necessary for theConference to have taken into account. A draft of such a statement was annexed to CP. (55) 121 and might appropriately be presented to the Conference jointly by the Colonial Secretary and the FinancialSecretary, Treasury.The Lord Chancellor sought especially the guidance of theCabinet on the attitude which should be adopted at the Conferencetowards Mr. MintpfTs proposals for Parliamentary representation.It was clear from the staiement which the Prime Minister had madein the House of Commons on 28th July, announcing thata Conference was being convened, that there was no intention of taking any final decision on this matter until the Conference had reported. But it might well influence the manner in which theConference should be handled if the Cabinet had in fact reached and preliminary conclusions as to the desirability or otherwise ofaccording direct Parliamentary representation for Malta.Discussion in the Cabinet turned mainly on this question. Itwas argued that, because of the repercussions which could beexpected from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well ascertain Colonial territories, if the financial proposal which were linked with Parliamentary representation were accepted, it would be wise to reach a preliminary conclusion on this main issue at thepresent stage. Such a conclusion need not be made public. Therewas some risk (although the circulation of the proposedmemorandum might obviate this) that considerable enthusiasm forthe MintolT proposals might develop in the Conference and that theGovernment might be faced by recommendations to which they might find themselves flatly opposed. Against this, it was argued that theGovernment had already welcomed the initiative shown byMr. Mintoff in seeking the closer association of Malta with the UnitedKingdom without expressing an opinion on his actual proposals for achieving this. The Government were faced with an extremelydifficult situation in Malta and the consequences which might Rowfrom the premature rejection of these proposals might be serious;In further discussion the following points were raised:  (a) Was it essential that Parliamentary representation should carry with it full voting rights or could some intermediate form of membership be devised? Against this, it was pointed out that therewas no precedent for limited membership of the House of Commons.Moreover, it wouid be impracticable to restrict the right of MalteseMalta.(previous reference: &apos;CM. (55) 30thConclusions,Minute 6.)

european defence.(previous reference:CM, (55) 9thConclusions,Minute 6.)Alert Measures.representatives to vote on matters of direct concern to Malta because \of the difficulty of segregating such questions from much wider issues.: j(b) Could not Parliamentary representation be granted without;necessarily incurring a commitment to raise Maltese standards of?wages and social services eventually to United Kingdom levels?Such a commitment would not be justified unless United Kingdomrates of taxation were applied to Malta. Nevertheless, representationwould be felt in the public mind to carry with it some undefinedclaim to equality of treatment with the United Kingdom.The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that, while he agreed .that it would not be appropriate to reach at this stage any general conclusion on the main issue, proposals which involved according fMalta equality with the United Kingdom in economic standards!!would have to be resisted. It was necessary that Malta should haveflan incentive to develop her own economy and to maintain emigration 1as a means of easing the costly burden of over-population.The Colonial Secretary said that he hoped the Cabinet would not Jfeel it necessary to reach any conclusion one way or the other before Ithe Conference started, for any such conclusion would inevitably be \reflected at the Conference itself and prejudice its findings. If the 1Cabinet had to reach a decision at this stage he thought it would have to be generally in favour of the Mintoff proposals.In further discussion it was agreed that it was essential that the 1Government representatives at the Conference should express fsympathy for the constitutional aspirations of Malta and reiterate the %welcome already given to the initiative which the Maltese Prime minister had taken. Paragraph 63 of the draft memorandum might ibe suitably amended to this effect. But the Conference should, if possible, be guided to concentrate upon the practicability of the Jvarious alternatives, including Mr. Mintoff&apos;s proposals, so as to put!before the Government a fully objective appraisal. The Lord.1Chancellor, as Chairman, would have the opportunity of consulting fthe Cabinet again while the Conference was in session should it prove 1necessary to do so. JThe Cabinet  fsi(1) Agreed that the memorandum annexed to CP. (55) 121,1amended to take account of the Cabinefs discussion, -should be circulated to the Round Table Conference onjlMalta as a statement on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s3Government.(2) Agreed to reach no conclusion at this stage on the merits ofParliamentary representation for Malta which  might fprejudice the outcome of the Conference.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor, as Chairman of the Conference;to attempt to secure an objective appraisal of the;practicability, both in their constitutional and theiffinancial aspects, of any proposals which the conference would have under consideration.2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (CP. (55) 120) about the proposals of theSupreme Allied Commander in Europe (SACEUR) for preparations!to be made in the warning periods which might be called in th0lNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation area.The Minister of Defence said that SACEUR had asked nationajlauthorities to agree that when a warning period was called he should!be automatically authorised to put into force measures which bjhimself could carry out, and that national authorities should at tbjsame time automatically put into force the measures which they
Draft white paper on theImplicationsof full employment.(previous reference:CM. (55) 30thConclusions,Minute 5.)colonial immigrants.(previous reference:CM. (55) 16thConclusions,Minute 1.)alone could take. For political and other reasons, it might tfot Vepossible for the Government to give full effect immediately to all&quot;&quot;c^i&quot;the preparations in question, and on certain of them &apos;:.. ifclft&quot;paragraph 7 of CP. (55) 120) the Government would have to reserve their position. Subject to that, we should do ail we could to meetSACEUR&apos;s wishes, and should assure him that even those measureson which the Government had to reserve their position would be:given the most sympathetic consideration when the time arose.The Cabinet Endorsed the proposals in CP. (55) 120.,.._________ -&apos;&quot;3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (55) 123) circulating a draft of a White Paper on industrial relations in the present economic situation, together with an explanatory note by the Financial Secretary.In discussion of the substance of the paper the view was expressed that, as the White Paper was primarily intended to providethe background for the measures which it was proposed to take to correct the economic situation, it would be unwise to includeAppendix I which contained an illustration of the possible state of the economy in ten years&apos; time. Politically, this Appendix gave hostagesto fortune unnecessarily. It was speculative, and might attractcriticism and debate which would deprive the White Paper as a wholeof its full value. It would be well also for the paper to developfurther the point that incomes were rising so fast as to draw excessiveimports into the country and to remove effective incentives forexport.In further discussion of the. timing of the publication of theWhite Paper, it was argued that it ought not to be published inconjunction with the measures which would be announced when parliament was recalled on 27th September. Publication of this paper could confuse the immediate issue and would lead theOpposition to demand additional time to debate it. Alternatively,because of the immediate measures, it might attract little attention and therefore fail in its purpose. Moreover, one of the main lessons of the White Paper was the need for a reduction in prices; this might read strangely in view of the effects of some of the measureswhich the Government were likely to propose. For these reasons,it might be preferable to publish the White Paper shortly beforeParliament reassembled in October.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the White paper would explain to the public generally, and especially to Government&apos;supporters, why certain measures to restrain excessive demand were necessary in present circumstances, and would at the same time make-it clear that the Government had not given up their policy ofeconomic expansion. From this point of view it might be useful to publish the White Paper shortly before the Conservative. Pgim.conference. This aspect of the Governmenfs policy could, however^be made clear by Ministers in the course of the debate on economic&quot;affairs when Parliament was recalled.The Cabinet Agreed to resume consideration of the draft White paper and the timing of its publication at their next meeting.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Home Secretary(CP. (55) 102) covering a report by officials on the social and economic problems arising from the influx into the.United Kingdpm of colouredworkers from other Commonwealth countries/ together with astatement on this subject in a form suitable for publication by theGovernment. The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum bythe Commonwealth Secretary (CP. (55) 113) about the difficulty of
discriminating against immigration from the Asian countries of theCommonwealth.The Home Secretary said that the Appendix to CP. (55) 102 was an objective statement which, if published, would not lead to ademand for legislation to restrict Colonial immigration; nor on theother hand would it preclude the Government from introducing such legislation or taking other action if this were later decided to benecessary. Generally speaking, Colonial immigration was not an acute problem at the moment, but it could become one particularly if there were to be a trade recession.The Minister of Housing said that in certain districts, such asBirmingham and Lambeth, Colonial immigration had already led to serious overcrowding and consequently to social disturbance. It was doubtful whether a requirement that a prospective immigrant iiadsuitable accommodation to which to go would be sufficient to avoidovercrowding, since such a control could easily be evaded; it would bebetter to require such immigrants, in addition to obtaining an employment certificate, to go to some area where there was no dangerof overcrowding. -Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinet thatthe publication of the statement in the Appendix to CP. (55) 102would not serve any useful purpose at the present time. It would bebetter for the Government first to decide whether any action to restrictColonial immigration was necessary, and if so what form it shouldtake.The Lord President said that he took a serious view of the dangers of uncontrolled Colonial immigration and was anxious that theCabinet should consider practical proposals for dealing with thismatter. He suggested that a draft Bill which had been prepared by theHome Office should be circulated as a basis for further discussion.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to circulate a draft Bill to controlColonial immigration, .as a basis for discussion at a later meeting.Cyprus.(previous reference:CM. (55) 30thConclusions,Minute 1.)TelevisionBroadcasts.5. The Colonial Secretary reported that the British broadcasting corporation (B.B.C) were proposing to send Mr. Woodrow Wyatt to cyprus on 18th September to collect material for a televisionbroadcast in this country on 26th September. Mr. Wyatt intended tointerview Archbishop Makarios and had asked for leave to interviewthe Governor of Cyprus. He would also need, of course, other facilities. It was not normal for Colonial Governors to be interviewedfor broadcast programmes of this kind but consideration would haveto be given to allowing this if Archbishop Makarios were given suchan opportunity to express his views. It was a most inopportunemoment for a broadcast of the kind proposed. The Minister ofDefence said that he had been asked to agree that the Commander-in-Chief should also be interviewed.The Postmaster-General said that it would be within his powersto direct the B.B.C. not to make this television broadcast but theCorporation were free to make public that they had been required to refrain from doing so.It was agreed in discussion&apos; that it would be undesirable toexercise compulsory powers in a matter of this kind, except possiblyas a last resort. The broadcast, which would be heard and seen onlyin the United Kingdom, would no doubt tend to give undue
prominence to the Greek point of view. Apart from the question ofspecial facilities, there was no essential difference between television broadcasting and the activities of newspaper or newsreel companieswho were free to comment on Cyprus affairs. The Director-Generalof the B.B.C. had on previous occasions responded very reasonablyto representations that certain broadcasts might prove embarrassing toHer Majesty&apos;s Government and could be approached on this occasion.On balance it would be better to get the programme postponed. Itwas desirable, if the programme were to take place, that theinternational and security significance of Cyprus together with theinterests of Turkey should be given due weight, and it was understoodthat Mr. Wyatt had offered to submit his programme to informalcensorship. If the B.B.C. were unwilling to postpone the broadcastbut. were prepared to satisfy the Government that it would be properlybalanced in this way it would probably be desirable to co-operate with it.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to approach the Director-General of the B.B.C. with a view to getting the proposedtelevision broadcast on Cyprus postponed until a moreopportune time or, if this were not possible, ensuring that itwould reflect all points of view in a reasonably balancedmanner.Bishop of The Colonial Secretary said that the Bishop of Kyrenia (who wasKyrenia. more extremist than Archbishop Makarios) had put himself within thescope of a detention order as a result of public statements approving the recent murder of a policeman and other crimes. His statements were direct incitements to violence and bloodshed and could not be overlooked. The Governor possessed powers under which the Bishopcould be detained and deported either to the United Kingdom (fromwhich, as a British subject, he would be free to leave forthwith but would not be allowed to re-enter- Cyprus) or to certain Colonial,territories where he could be locked up. On the other hand, he sawgreat dillicuities in taking such action forthwith for it might well be misunderstood in the United States, whose support was needed if wewere to prevent the inscription of Cyprus as an item on the agenda ofthe forthcoming Assembly or the United Nations.It was the general feeling of the Cabinet that, while it was not our traditional habit to put people under legal restraint merely for makingviolent utterances, there could be no compromise with the publiccondonation of murder. Moreover, it would be necessary to showthat effective action had been taken against the Bishop if the morale of the Cyprus police were to be maintained. But it was for themoment more important to prevent the inscription of Cyprus on theUnited Nations agenda. The Cabinet were informed that, whileproceedings clearly could not be delayed unduly, it would still bepossible to take action against the Bishop after the question ofinscription had been settled.The Cabinet I Agreed in principle on the necessity for taking action againstthe Bishop of Kyrenia for inflammatory utterances and\      decided to review the matter again at a later meeting.Disarmament. 6.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the progress(Previous 0^ *&apos;ie United Nations Disarmament Sub-Committee meeting.   reference- said that Mr. Stassen (the special assistant on disarmament to. the cm. (55) 30th President of the United States) had continued to press the new planConclusions, amplifying the President&apos;s original proposals for an exchange of minute io.)&apos; military information and aerial surveys between the United Statesand the Soviet Union, but had failed to reply to Russian enquiries
whether the proposal would cover nuclear weapons and whether itwould apply to other countries.Mr. Stassen had wanted to table a resolution on the american proposals in the Sub-Committee, for submission later to the general assembly of the United Nations. This would have enabled theRussians to exploit differences between the Western Allies on theseproposals, and would have given them grounds for seeking a vote inthe General Assembly on their own disarmament proposals.Fortunately Mr. Stassen had eventually been persuaded not to pursuefor the time being the idea of tabling such a resolution.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.United Nations.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 25thConclusions,Minute 6.)Admission ofNew Members.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (55) 124) proposing that the views of the United Statesand French Governments should be sought on a Canadian proposalto reach an understanding with the Soviet Government for the admission of seventeen new members to the United Nations.The Foreign Secretary said that candidates for membership tothe United Nations proposed by the Western Powers had so far beenvetoed by the Russians, because the Russian candidates had failedto obtain sufficient favourable votes in the Security Council. Tobreak the deadlock, the Russians had hitherto proposed that certaintWestern and Soviet candidates should be admitted together, butwe had rejected this as inconsistent with the Charter. Ji had nowbeen suggested that all &quot;qualified States &quot; (as set out in paragraph 4of CP. (55.) 124) should be admitted. This would provide for the admission of seventeen new members and could be regarded asconsistent with the Charter. Although these admissions would havedisadvantages from our point of view, particularly in that the votingposition of the Colonial Powers would be adversely affected, the deadlock would be broken, and the legitimate complaints of certain countries, such as Italy, would be met.The admission of Spain was at present specifically barred by twoGeneral Assembly Resolutions of 1946. While we should be preparedto support the admission of Spain, we should not raise this issueourselves at the present time.Discussion showed that several members of the Cabinet took theview that on balance it was contrary to our interests to enlarge the membership of the United Nations. In the past we had consistentlyopposed the admission of a large number of additional countries.Many of the candidates now suggested would vote against us on colonial questions, and we might then have to withdraw frommeetings at which we considered that the competence of the united nations was being exceeded.The view was also expressed that if we had to agree to the admission of such countries as Outer Mongolia, we should take theinitiative in seeking the admission of Spain.ft was pointed out that it was not unlikely that the SovietGovernment would refuse to support the admission of Japan atpresent; in that case the United States would not agree to the admission of the rest of the &quot;qualified States,&quot; and the present proposals would come to nothing. Moreover, it was thought thatthe Canadian and Australian Governments were in favour of reaching a prior understanding with the Soviet Government for the admissionof the seventeen countries in question.The Lord President said that it seemed to be the view of theCabinet that it was not necessary for the United Kingdom to take any initiative for the admission of the seventeen &quot;qualified States.&quot;But&apos;if the Canadian and Australian Governments were strongly in
Broadcasting.The fortnight rule.(Previous  .Reference:CM. (55) 16thConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The Lord Privy Seal said that the discussions with Leadersof the Opposition Parties had shown that the Government would havethe support of the Labour Opposition for the retention of the ruleunder which discussions or ex parte statements could not be broadcast on any issue during a period of a fortnight before it was debated in either House of Parliament. The Leader of the Liberal Party was,however, opposed to the retention of this rule.The Labour Opposition were still opposed to television broadcasting of non-political statements by Ministers; the liberal party did not object to such broadcasts.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Foreign Affairs.Soviet-GermanTalks.(previous reference:CM. (55) 19thConclusions,Minute 6.)9. The Foreign Secretary said that the agreement concluded bythe Federal German Chancellor (Dr. Adenauer) had caused muchconcern in the United States and France. There was little doubt thatit represented a substantial victory for Soviet diplomacy and it didnot improve prospects for the forthcoming meeting of foreign ministers in Geneva.It might well be that Dr. Adenauer would react strongly if theRussians failed to fulfil their undertaking to release the german prisoners.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th September, 1955.favour of seeking an agreement with the Soviet Union for thatpurpose, we should be prepared to support them.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to take the views expressed intheir discussion into account in making further soundingsabout the proposal for the admission of the seventeen&quot; qualified States &quot; to the United Nations.
