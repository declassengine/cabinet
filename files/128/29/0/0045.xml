(55) 35thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was agreed that the Lord Privy Seal should announce, in his business statement on 8th December, that Parliament would be adjourned for the Christmas recess on 21st December, if the stateof business permitted, and would reassemble on 24th January.It was pointed out that it was particularly desirable to complete the Committee stage of the Housing Subsidies Bill before the recess.This might be possible if, in addition to the one day which it was proposed to devote to this subject on 14th December, a further daycould be provided in the following week before the adjournment.Whether this could be done could only be decided in the light of progress made with the Committee stage of the Bill on14th December. An undertaking had been given however that, ifpossible, time would be provided for a debate on Wales before the recess, and it would be desirable to find time also for a debate on civil Aviation.2. The Cabinet were informed of the terms in which the PrimeMinister proposed to reply to Questions in Parliament that afternoonabout the Government^ attitude to atom and hydrogen bomb tests.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, since these Questionssuggested that the prohibition or limitation of such tests should be proposed at the forthcoming meeting with the President of the UnitedStates, and at the subsequent meeting with the Soviet leaders, itshould if necessary be pointed out, in a supplementary reply, thatthe Prime Minister must be left to decide how best to take any initiative in this direction, but that the discussion could be expectedto include all important topics.In discussion, it was also pointed out that public apprehensionsprang from a general fear of the effects of radio-activity resultingfrom test explosions. It was expected that the report of the medical research Council, which was examining this question, would be ready in two or three months&apos; time. The United States Academy of Scienceswas also producing a report on this subject. It was the general viewof the Cabinet that a supplementary reply might well point out thatthese reports would be relevant to the question whether tests of atomand hydrogen bombs should be prohibited or limited in some way.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the terms in which the PrimeMinister proposed to reply to Parliamentary Questions onthis subject.3. The Cabinet had a preliminary discussion of the questionwhether, in view of the statements made by Marshal Buiganin andM. Khruschev in India and Burma, the invitation to the soviet leaders to visit this country ought not to be withdrawn.The Lord President said that, although he could advance noexplanation why the Soviet leaders had. seen fit to indulge incalculated insults to this country during their tour of India and burma, he felt that if these statements had not been withdrawn and given place to a marked improvement in the atmosphere by next spring the proposed visit might have the most serious effects on our prestige in the rest of the world.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, notwithstandingthese unfriendly statements, it would be unwise to take a hastydecision on a matter of such great importance. Although it remaineduncertain why the Soviet leaders should have decided to make these statements, it might be that, having concluded that the risk of earlynuclear war was slight, they saw the immediate struggle for power
in terms of a struggle for influence over Eastern peoples and had decided that abuse would help in undermining the confidence of eastern countries in the Western Powers. The statements might also reflect a struggle for power within the Kremlin. In spite of theprovocation which had been offered it was too early yet to take theview that peaceful coexistence with the Soviet group was unattainableand until we were in a position to bring all the neutral Powers withinthe Western orbit it would remain to our advantage to pursue apolicy of coexistence, if it could be secured on reasonable terms.But, in view of the statements which had been made, the visit, if itwere to take place, might now assume a somewhat different form,with much greater emphasis on discussion between the twoGovernments of the basis of mutual self-respect on which coexistencemust inevitably rest. It was also pointed out that from time to timeleading members of Governments in the United Kingdom had madestatements highly critical of the Soviet system and leaders.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their consideration of this subject at alater meeting and invited the Foreign Secretary and theCommonwealth Secretary, in consultation, to circulate amemorandum containing the texts of the statements whichMarshal Bulganin and M. Khruschev were reported to havemade in India antd Burma, together with the text of anyrelevant statements on the Soviet system and leaders whichmight have been made in the past by leading members ofa United Kingdom Government.Road HaulageDisposals Bill.(previous reference:CM. (55) 44thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (55) 193) setting out the conclusions reached by aCommittee of Ministers under his Chairmanship on the steps whichshould be taken to dispel the anxiety which had developed over theGovernment^ proposals regarding the trunk road services.The Lord Chancellor said that the Committee, in considering what steps it might be justifiable to take to allay the sense of disquietwhich had developed, had examined three possible courses of action.First, they had considered whether, in view of the fact that the vehicles and equipment of the trunk services had been put on offer of sale in an atmosphere of uncertainty created by the imminence ofa General Election, a case might be established for repeating theoffer of sale and putting List S.4 on offer again. There had, however,been no pressure for the offer to be repeated under more stableconditions after the Government had returned to power, and further efforts to sell the equipment of the undertaking would not satisfy the real preferences of the Road Haulage Association (R.H.A.),whose members were more anxious to secure the dismantlement ofa large and powerful competitor than to acquire its assets. TheCabinet had decided in July that List S.4 should not be put on saleagain; the Committee could see no grounds for changing thisdecision; and the case against disposing of this equipment in smallunits, which would lead to the fragmentation of a valuable publicservice, had not lost its force. Equally, there was no call to ascertain whether some buyers might be interested in a proportion of the equipment offered in medium-sized lots, for the disposal of othervehicles was still continuing and 100 lorries, including some heavyunits, remained unsold from the last offer.The Committee had also considered whether the transformationof the trunk services into a public company, in which the privateinvestor would be able to participate, could be justified as a meansof meeting the criticism which had been expressed on grounds ofprinciple by Government supporters. But any such proposal would provoke controversy and the successful marketing of the shares in the enterprise, which would itself be a difficult and prolonged operation
as the company would have a capital value of about  25 millions,would be jeopardised by the threat of renationalisation. This course was not therefore recommended.The Committee had however concluded that it would be bothjustifiable and practicable, if the point were pressed, to give theprivate haulier some limited protection against the competitive power of the large and powerful trunk services by prohibiting the British Transport Commission from increasing, over the next five years, the number of licences for these services which they already held. This minor concession would not, however, go far enough to satisfy either the R.H.A. or the doctrinal critics. It would therefore remain necessary to convince Government supporters thatthe decision to preserve the trunk road services had been fully justified in the circumstances, for there had been no inclination onthe part of the road haulage industry to take over this service in a manner which would prevent its fragmentation. It was proposedthat further steps should be taken to ensure that all the facts were known to Government supporters and that the Lord Chancellor andthe Minister of Transport should attend the meeting which had beenarranged for 8th December.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the justification for restricting the freedom of the Commission to acquire additionallicences. It could be argued that the restriction would hamper theneeds of a growing public service and it could also be argued that itwould act as a limitation on free competition. On the other hand,the Commission were able more powerfully than the private haulierto advocate their claim for additional licences before the licensing authorities and they were more favourably placed for obtaining newequipment. Moreover, it could be said that the decision that theCommission should retain the trunk service vehicles had created anentirely new situation in which the private haulier would becompeting with a trunk service fleet several times larger than he hadbeen led to assume would exist. This would justify affording theprivate haulier the limited additional protection that could be madeavailable if a demand arose for it.It was pointed out that the Government were not in breach ofany undertaking given at the Election in deciding, in the circum-stances which had arisen, to retain the trunk service vehicles and itwas hoped that the disquiet among Government supporters, whichmight be sufficiently widespread to jeopardise the Second Reading ofthe forthcoming Bill, would be dispelled by the further explanations\ which would be given them.The Cabinet-Approved the conclusions set out in CP. (55) 193.Canals. 5.   The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the composition(Previous of the proposed Committee of Enquiry into the system of inlandReference: waterways and had before them a note by the Acting Secretary of cm. (55) 38th the Cabinet (CP. (55) 192) covering revised proposals for theConclusions, membership of this Committee put forward by the Minister of minute 6.) Transport.The Minister of Transport said that, in general accordance withthe Cabinefs decision, he had reduced the proposed membership ofthis Committee to a total of seven. He had not thought it necessaryto include a Welshman as there were no navigable canals in Wales.It was intended that the industrialist who would be nominated bythe Federation of British Industries, would be chosen specially torepresent the interests of those industries which continued to make49606-2 B 3
Soda! Services.        6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor(Previous of the Exchequer (CP. (55) 188) about the increasing cost of the reference: social services.  They also had before them a memorandum by the cm. (55) 20th Minister of Education (CP. (55) 189) suggesting a further examinationConclusions, of the possibility of adopting a new policy with regard to charges for minute 4.) school meals.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the survey which hadbeen made of the probable course of Government expenditure on thesocial services during the next five years, which was summarised inthe Annex to CP. (55) 188, made no allowance for any substantial improvement in those services. Even on that basis, it was estimatedthat expenditure on the social services, including insurance would increase from  2,032 millions in the current financial year to 2,369 millions in 1960-61. This increase was mainly concentrated on four services National Insurance ( 131 millions), Education( 94 millions), National Health Service ( 72 millions) and Housing( 17 millions). It represented a cumulative increase at a rate ofabout 3  per cent, per annum; if the Insurance Funds were excluded, the cumulative increase was about 3i per cent, per annum.The prospective rate of growth of this expenditure was thereforegreater than the increase in the Gross National Product, in real terms,in the five years up to 1954 (which was 2% per cent, per annum).If a reduction in the rates of taxation was to be achieved, it wasnecessary to ensure that total expenditure did not rise as fast as theincrease in the yield of revenue. It was therefore of vital importance that the possibility of moderating the increase in expenditure on thesocial services should be investigated. He suggested that aCommittee of Ministers should be appointed to consider the resultsof the survey of Government expenditure on the social services, andto report what policy changes would be necessary to secure an appreciable reduction in the rate at which that expenditure was expected to increase.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) Long-term estimates were necessarily speculative. This was particularly true of the figures for Insurance and national assistance expenditure; the calculations of net expenditure in this field made in 1946 were  800 millions higher than the actual resultover the last eight years.(b) The survey compared the estimated increase in the cost ofthe social services over the coming five years with the increase inthe Gross National Product over the past five years. Such a comparison was of doubtful validity. For example, the proportionof the Gross National Product which had been taken by the national health Service over the past few years had decreased every year.(c) Substantial social service benefits were being enjoyed by a-large number of people who, because of full employment, were not:   now in real need of them.  The burden of providing these benefitsfell most heavily on the middle classes.(d) The forecasts of future social services expenditure includedin the survey had not been subjected to the normal process of examination between the Departments concerned and the Treasury;it could reasonably be expected that these estimates would be prunedconsiderably.use of the canals for the transport of goods. As, therefore, anindustrialist would not be included as such, the trade unions mightnot feel disposed to press for representation.The Cabinet Approved the Minister of Transports proposals for the membership of a Committee of Enquiry into the system of inland waterways.
(e) It would be necessary for the proposed Committee to giveearly attention to both the Guillebaud Report on the National health services, and the Report of the Committee on the Economic andFinancial Problems of the Provision for Old Age (the PhillipsCommittee), as it was desirable that the Government should soon be in a position to indicate their attitude towards the recommenda-tions in these reports.(/) The Minister of Education said that the estimate of future expenditure on education included in the survey did not take accountof any expansion in technical education, a long-term plan for whichhad almost been completed. He hoped, however, that this question might be considered separately from an examination of the futurecost of the social services, since technical education, as one of themain elements in the expansion of production, was of a different character from the social services as that term was normallyunderstood.Further discussion showed that it was the general view of theCabinet that a Committee of Ministers should be appointed asproposed in paragraph 7 of CP. (55) 188. It would be appropriate for such a Committee to examine the possibility of adopting adifferent policy on the school meals service, as suggested in cp. (55) 189. Proposals for the expansion of technical educationwere, in the opinion of the Cabinet, a separate matter.The Cabinet then considered the composition and terms ofreference of the proposed Committee. It was their general view that,on balance, it would be preferable for the Ministers responsible forthe social services to be represented, although in that case theCommittee would have to be fairly large. It would also be desirable for the Secretary of State for Scotland to be a member, in view of his responsibility for social services in Scotland.As regards the Committee&apos;s terms of reference, the Chancellorof the Exchequer pointed out that it might not be practicable to ask the Committee to work towards a specific reduction in the estimated expenditure. He undertook to consider further how the terms ofreference might be defined.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a Committee of Ministers, to include theMinisters responsible for the social services, should beappointed, as proposed in paragraph 7 of CP. (55) 188.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to prepare suitable terms of reference for such a Committee for the approvalof the Prime Minister.(3) Invited the Minister of Education to circulate for the cabinet&apos;s consideration in due course, proposals for an expansion in technical education.Egypt.(previous reference:CM. (55) 42ndConclusions,Minute 9.)Palestinians inthe Canal Zone.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (55) 191) recommending that the Government should assume responsibility for the re-engagement elsewhere of some 700Palestinian workers who were becoming surplus in the Canal Zone.The Foreign Secretary said that a certain moral obligation restedon the Government to provide for the re-settlement of thesePalestinians who, in spite of being Arabs, were regarded with hostilityby the Egyptian authorities because of the loyalty which they had shown to us. If provision could not be made for them they wouldbe faced with the prospect of deportation to refugee camps in theGaza Strip. If, however, the Government were prepared to accepta general responsibility for their welfare, he hoped that it would bepossible for the Service Departments, under detailed arrangements which could be worked out, to re-engage as many as possible for service in Cyprus and elsewhere in the Middle East.
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War said thathis Department were prepared to consider the engagement for service in the Middle East of as many of these men as possible. It would benecessary, however, to secure the co-operation of the other service departments. Moreover, his Department employed many thousands of aliens in the Canal Zone and elsewhere, and although it was truethat the majority had satisfactory papers enabling them to return home, it must be recognised that the proposed arrangements would create a precedent which might prove embarrassing in the future.The Minister of Defence said that, as an essential condition which might be necessary to enable National Service to be broughtto an end, he was investigating the possibility of building up a GeneralServices Corps overseas which would have to comprise some 50/60,000workers. Such a Corps, if it came into existence, would provide a means of absorping surplus workers for whom a continuingresponsibility might in some way rest upon the Government.The Cabinet Endorsed the proposals in CP. (55) 191 and invited theForeign Secretary to consult with the Service departments on arrangements for the re-engagement of the surplusPalestinian workers in the Canal Zone.Cyprus. 8.   The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of Cyprus(Previous had power to arrest and deport those responsible for disorder and references: disaffection in appropriate cases, but he had been asked to seek the cm. (55) 44th approval of the United Kingdom Government in advance if he conclusions, proposed to arrest and deport prominent clerics.   The Governor had minute 1, and now asked for authority to take this action against the Bishop of cm. (55) 42nd Kyrenia, in view of the incitement to violence which, according to conclusions, reliable reports, had been included in his sermon on 4th December.The Colonial Secretary said that he was anxious to give thefullest possible support to the Governor. He had also made it clear to the Governor that he should take the earliest opportunity ofproscribing the Communist trade unions, which he had full authorityto do as soon as he thought fit, and of arresting and deportingCommunist leaders. To deport the Bishop of Kyrenia would,however, on balance have an unfavourable effect on the GreekGovernment, and would make it even more difficult to bring abouta resumption of the discussions between the Governor andArchbishop Makarios which might lead to a political settlement.The Archbishop could not afford publicly to dissociate himself fromthe Bishop of Kyrenia, and the Greek Government would be unwilling to condone the deportation of the latter, at any rate before thegeneral election in Greece next March. In spite of continuingprovocation it would therefore be unwise to accede to the Governorsrequest for the time being.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith this view.In discussion, it was pointed out that when the Governor of cyprus had made this request he had not been aware of the latest developments in Greece, which appeared to indicate that the GreekGovernment would go some way towards encouraging Archbishop Makarios to resume the discussions with the Governor. In view ofthis, the Governor would no doubt appreciate the necessity for postponing action against the Bishop of Kyrenia. It could be explained &quot;to him that the attempt to reach a political solution was at a critical stage, and that it would probably be known in two orthree weeks&apos; time whether this would succeed. If the attempt thenproved to have failed, there would be no; reason for refraining fromdeporting the Bishop of Kyrenia, or other prominent clerics, as soonas there was cause to do so.
The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to explain to the governor of Cyprus why authority to arrest and deport the Bishopof Kyrenia could not be given for the time being.industrial disputes.Rolls-RoyceFactories inScotland.(previous reference:CM. (55) 43rdConclusions,Minute 4.)Port of London.(previous reference:CM. (55) 41stConclusions,Minute 12.)engineering industry.9. The Minister of Labour said that there was now some danger that the strike at the Rolls Royce factories in Scotland might spread to the English factories of the company and that the amalgamated engineering Union might call a token strike of their other members on Clydeside in sympathy on the following day. There was no doubtthat this strike was Communist inspired. The management of the rolls Royce Company remained unwilling that the Minister shouldintervene, for they were not prepared to discuss the dismissal of aworker who had broken no regulation of theirs and felt that thestrike must be resisted. This strike was an example of trade unionsolidarity being pressed to excessive lengths.It was expected that the lightermen in the Port of London, whoseUnion Executive was due to meet on the following day, wouldprobably refuse to use for the settlement of their dispute themachinery provided by the Port Labour Executive Committee. Theemployers were also reluctant to negotiate over the inflated claim which the lightermen had put forward. If negotiations did not takeplace and lead to a settlement, a strike of the lightermen would begin on 1st January.The joint talks on the wage claim which had been put forward by the engineering unions had been postponed until 29th December.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th December, 1955.
