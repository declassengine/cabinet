1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons on those days in the following week whenthe House would not be occupied with proceedings on theFinance Bill.The Cabinet recorded their satisfaction at the agreement whichthe Leader of the House of Commons had made with the Oppositionon the handling of business in the House of Commons during theremainder of the present session.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet ofthe general lines of a statement on the current difficulties of the cottonindustry which he proposed to make in the House of Commons that afternoon when replying to the general debate on the Budget. Inparticular, he proposed to make it clear that the Government wereawaiting the outcome of discussions with the Government of India,and to promise an announcement of the Governments final conclusions before Parliament was dissolved.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet on the need for some further Government statement on thissubject before the end of the Budget debate, and on the terms of thestatement which the Chancellor proposed to make.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to include in his speech in the Budget, debate that afternoon a statement onthe current difficulties of the cotton industry on the general lines indicated to the Cabinet.3. The Minister of Transport recalled that the Cabinet hadalready agreed in principle that increases in railway charges of theorder indicated in his memorandum C. (55) 67 would have to beaccepted, but had invited him to discuss the timing of these increaseswith the Chairman of the British Transport Commission. Inaccordance with the Cabinefs wishes he had taken steps, inaccordance with the procedure laid down by section 82 of theTransport Act, 1947, to obtain the views of the permanent membersof the Transport Tribunal, acting as a Consultative Committee, on proposed increases in railway freight rates and dock and canalcharges which would yield  17-7 millions. Their views wouldprobably be submitted to him in the following week, and the way would then be clear for him to authorise the increased charges. TheTransport Commission had also made application to the Tribunal,under the special procedure of section 23 of the Transport Act, 1953,for leave to make further increases in main-line fares and increases in fares on London Transport lines and on the London lines of british railways, which would yield altogether  4 millions. From their discussions as a Consultative Committee the members of theTransport Tribunal would already be aware of the changes whichwere likely to be made in railway freight rates and dock and canalcharges. The Minister had reason to expect that, immediately after he had received the views of the permanent members of the transport tribunal on these proposed increases, the Tribunal would reply to theCommission^ application for leave to make the proposed further increases in passenger fares, and the Commission were under a statutory obligation to publish without delay the reply of the Tribunalon any such application. In the normal course, therefore, the prospective increases in passenger fares and in railway freight ratesand dock and canal charges were likely to be announced within thenext two weeks. The increases in passenger fares could be brought-1 &quot; b 2

The Minister of Labour said that the Chairman and secretary of the Trades Union Congress had suggested that he should see the leaders of the Associated Society of Locomotive engineers and Firemen (A.S.L.E.F.), and he had done so on the previous day.The Union had put before him a strong case on the subject of wagedifferentials but they had not been able to justify their peremptoryrejection of the award of the Railway Staff National Tribunal andtheir decision to call a strike. He had suggested to them that theycould have taken the alternative course of lodging a strong protest and,after a suitable interval, submitting a further wage claim; and he had urged them to reconsider even now their decision to strike on 1st May.There was nothing more that he could do at this stage. Meanwhile,the National Union of Railwaymen had declared their oppositionto the proposed strike and their determination to keep their membersat work if it should occur. There seemed to be a reasonable prospect that they would succeed in doing so provided that nothing was said on behalf of the Transport Commission or the Government to indicateany prospect of a concession to A.S.L.E.F.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.into operation within about ten days after an announcement, but therewould be a longer delay before increased railway freight rates anddock and canal charges could be brought into operation. TheCommission might, however, decide, as they had on a previous occasion, that it would be advantageous from their point of view tobring all the increases into operation at one time. The Minister saidthat it was likely that, before Parliament was dissolved, he wouldbe asked in the House of Commons whether the Commission had applied for leave to make increases in railway charges. In any case,the dates when any applications had been made and the dates of their approval and announcement must in due course become public whenthe Transport Tribunal and the Commission issued their reports.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the arrangementsfor announcing, and thereafter bringing into operation, the prospective increases in railway charges should be allowed to followtheir normal course. This was likely to lead to a fairly early announcement that the increases were to be made, but their introduction might be deferred until the end of May or early June.The Cabinet were reminded that, when they had last considered this matter, they had taken the view that the Government wouldbe vulnerable to criticism if they allowed extensive increases in railway charges to be announced without, at the same time, providingfurther evidence that effective action was being taken to eliminateredundancy and restrictive practices on the railways.The Minister of Transport said that it would be possible toinclude in any announcement of the prospective increases in chargessome statement about the measures taken to secure further economies which, as explained in C. (55) 67, were estimated to yield a saving of  15 millions in a full year.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport to arrange for furtherproceedings on the current applications for increases in railway charges to follow their normal course.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to arrange that any public announcement of the prospective increases in charges should include a suitable reference to the steps so far takento secure further economies on the railways.
Blsarmamemt 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that it was evident that the(Previous        Disarmament Sub-Committee of the United Nations would not be reference :      able to make substantial progress towards an international agreement.C.C. (55) 19th   In the normal course it might be expected that their discussions would conclusions,     be brought to a close within the next few weeks. Their report to the minute 2.)       United Nations, when it was made public, would show that it was theSoviet reluctance to make any concessions that had prevented further progress.   On the other hand the public, here and abroad, wouldbe disappointed at the failure of the talks; and the timing of theSub-Committee&apos;s report should therefore be considered in relationboth to the Election in this country and to the projected invitation to the Soviet Government to attend a Four-Power Meeting.   it seemed to him desirable that the current discussions should not be broken off at least until that invitation had been despatched.   he therefore hoped that the Sub-Committee might be able to continue their work for another four or five weeks.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in the absenceof any further concessions by the Soviet Government, there was littlemore for the Sub-Committee to discuss, and the other Western powers might prefer to bring the proceedings to a close so that their attitudecould be publicly stated in the Sub-Committee&apos;s report. The soviet representatives, on the other hand, might be in no hurry to bringthe discussions to an end and he could try to prolong the proceedings,if necessary by moving a further adjournment. The UnitedStates Government could presumably be asked to instruct their representative to co-operate in this attempt to defer breaking off thediscussions until agreement had been reached on the terms of an invitation to a Four-Power Meeting.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to do his utmost to prolong, for another four or five weeks, the presentation of a report by the Disarmament Sub-Committeeof the United Nations.European 5.   The Foreign Secretary said that he was still trying to obtainDefence and the agreement of the other Western Powers to the time-table which heFour-Power had put to the Cabinet on 19th April for completing the ratificationsMeeting. of the Paris Agreements, admitting the German Federal Republic to(Previous        the North Atlantic Alliance and settling the terms of an invitation to reference :      the Soviet Government to attend a Four-Power Meeting. The FrenchCM. (55) 4th    Government were still, however, reluctant to bring the SaarConclusions,    Agreement into force until they had settled to their satisfaction the minute 5.)       question of the future ownership of the Roechling steelworks.   he hoped that this difficulty might be overcome by an agreement,between the French and German Governments, that this question should be referred to arbitration.  It would be appropriate that theWestern European Union should undertake, as one of its first acts,to arrange for such an arbitration.The Prime Minister recalled that in the motion which the Houseof Commons had carried on 5th April, 1954, the suggestion of a Four-Power Meeting had been linked with the aim of preventing a warin which thermo-nuclear weapons would be used. He hoped that,in the forthcoming discussion of the agenda for a Four-power meeting, this would not be overlooked. Though it should doubtlessinclude other items, the agenda should not exclude discussion of thegeneral question of disarmament. This part of the agenda should,however, be so framed as to ensure that international control overthermo-nuclear weapons was discussed as part of the general problemof reducing armaments of all kinds.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.
Formosa. 7.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had not yet completed the(Previous        preparation of the two draft statements on Formosa which he had reference:      mentioned at the Cabinefs meeting on 19th April.   Meanwhile,CM. (55) 4th    however, the United States Secretary of State had asked HerConclusions,     Majesty&apos;s Minister in Washington whether the United KingdomMinute 6.)       Government could not produce some suggestions for a fresh initiative in this matter.   This enquiry gave us a favourable opportunity for putting to the United States Government proposals on the lines indicated to the Cabinet at their last discussion.The Prime Minister said that it was desirable that a further public statement on this problem should be made on behalf of the UnitedKingdom Government well before the Election. He hoped that oursuggestions could be put to the United States Government in thecourse of the following week.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd April, 1955.\
