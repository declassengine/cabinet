Disappearance 1.   The Cabinet were informed that, in the forthcoming debateof two Foreign in the House of Commons on the disappearance of two ForeignOffice Officials. Service officers, the spokesman for the Labour Opposition would(Previous propose the appointment of two committees of enquiry (i) a smallReference : committee of Privy Counsellors, which would consider and report on. (55) 38th: the staffing and organisation of the Foreign Office, and (ii) a committeeConclusions, of three lawyers, which would report privately to the ForeignMinute 1.) Secretary on security questions.In discussion it was pointed out that a comprehensive reorganised-isation of the Foreign Service had been carried out since the end ofthe war, and there seemed to be no need for any further enquiry onthat aspect of the matter. On the outstanding problems of securityit was unlikely that useful advice would be obtained from a committee consisting wholly of lawyers. On the other hand, it might be helpful ifthe security procedures applicable to persons in the public service andcertain related questions could be reviewed by a small body of PrivyCounsellors who held, or had held, Ministerial office. The PrimeMinister undertook to ascertain, before the debate, whether the leader of the Opposition would be disposed to support a suggestionon those lines.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.The second reading of the Finance Bill would be taken on 8th November. It was agreed that it would be unnecessary for theChancellor of the Exchequer to speak in that debate.House ofCommonsDisqualificationBill.(previous reference :CM. (55) 35thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Home Secretary said that Clause 6 of the House ofCommons Disqualification Bill would have the effect of disqualifyingfor membership of the House of Commons any person who had acontrolling shareholding in a company which accepted government contracts. It had been brought to his notice that certain supporters of the Government in the House of Commons were now in this position and that, if the Bill passed in its present form, they wouldbe obliged at the next General Election to relinquish their seats orto dispose of their shareholding. He himself considered that thisprovision should stand unaltered. It was justified on the merits.Moreover, the text of the Bill had already been shown to theOpposition, since its preparation had been commenced by the LabourParty when in office. He had, however, thought it right that theCabinet should be aware of this point.The Cabinet Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement, but agreedthat no change should be made on this account in theprovisions of Clause 6 of the House of commons disqualification Bill.Road Haulage Disposals EMI.(previous reference :CM. (55) 35thConclusions,Minute 9.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (CP. (55) 169) setting out the conclusions reached by the Committee of Ministers which had been invited toconsider further his proposals in regard to the transport levy and theretention of contract hire vehicles.The Minister of Transport said that his colleagues had agreedthat there were no, sufficient grounds for continuing the transportlevy beyond the end of 1956 in order to meet the claim of the british transport Commission for additional compensation, and that the Billshould contain provision for bringing the levy to.an end.   As regards
Egypt. 5.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of theHigh Dam Exchequer (CP. (55) 168) covering a memorandum by officials on the at Aswan.       financing of the Aswan High Dam.(Previous The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that from calculationsReference: made in discussions in Washington with representatives of the cm. (55) 37th United States Government and the International Bank it now seemedConclusions. clear that the financial risks involved in under-writing the High DamMinute 3.) project had been substantially under-estimated. The estimate setout in the memorandum attached to CP. (55) 168 that Egypt would face at minimum a foreign exchange deficit of  50- 70 million overthe period of the scheme was in itself based on an assumption, onwhich little reliance could be placed, that the Egyptian authorities would, during the long period of the Dam&apos;s construction, follow apolicy of rigorous austerity combined with careful control of otherinvestment expenditure. Moreover, the eventual cost of projects ofthis kind almost invariably exceeded the original estimates, sometimesby a substantial margin. It would therefore be contrary to soundfinancial judgment to undertake the entire financial risk, even in association with our European partners, without other outsideassistance. Although he had no doubt that it would eventually benecessary for us to accept some financial liability, it would not be within our resources to guarantee the entire operation, and the sterling balances which Egypt possessed would not provide sufficientsecurity. He therefore proposed, modifying somewhat the recom-mendations in CP. (55) 168, that we should continue to pursueurgently in Washington the possibility of securing American financial support, either through the International Bank or directly from theUnited States Government or both. The International Bank were committed, because of pressure we ourselves had exerted, to a policyof international tender for construction contracts. But the High Damproject was so unusual that the Bank might be prepared to modify their tendering requirements and the United States Administrationmight support us in our efforts to persuade them to do so. DirectAmerican assistance would involve the participation of United Statesconcerns in some form and this would probably entail givingAmerican participants a 25 per cent, interest in the consortium. he realised, however, that Mr. Kaissouni, the Egyptian Minister ofFinance, who was due here in a few days, might react adversely tothe prospect of American concerns participating because their prices were understood to be high.the contract hire vehicles, it was now proposed to include a provision in the Bill allowing the Commission to retain the vehicles they would need for continuing contract work, subject to the limitation that, as now, these vehicles would only qualify for a contract &quot;A&quot; licenceand not for an open &quot; A &apos;r licence. This proposal was acceptable to the Road Haulage Association, whom he had felt it necessary to consult as they had been parties to the earlier agreement governing the contract vehicles. In view of the attitude of the Association he now had less fear that Government supporters would challenge theproposal.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the transport commission should not be obliged to sell existing vehicles and buynew ones for contract work which was to continue. As the varioushire contracts expired the private firms making use of this service would be free to negotiate new contracts with private transportoperators, and the latter would be free to compete with theCommission for this business.The Cabinet Approved the proposals outlined in CP. (55) 169.
Against all these considerations must be balanced the risk that,while negotiations continued, the Russians might obtain control overthe project. The prospect of several hundred Soviet engineersestablished on the Upper Nile would certainly give grounds for alarm,but he thought it unlikely that the Egyptians would be precipitate inconcluding a deal with the Russians.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It would be necessary to be cautious in discussing withMr. Kaissouni the possibility of American firms participating in the project and, in particular, to avoid giving the impression that we hadbroached this possibility in Washington. It would, however, bepossible to suggest to Mr. Kaissouni that the International Bankmight make such a suggestion to him when he was in Washington,and to ask what, in that event, his reactions would be.(b) It would be preferable that our immediate efforts should be restricted to an attempt to obtain financial support for the projectfrom the International Bank alone. We should inform the UnitedStates Government of our intentions in this respect (and try tosecure their support); but we should refrain, pending the outcome ofMr. Kaissounfs visit here, from making any further suggestion thatthe United States Government might provide direct financialassistance for the project.(c) It was the general feeling of the Cabinet that the contractmust somehow be obtained for the European consortium in spite ofthe financial difficulties. It was argued that  70 million as a measureof risk was not an excessive commitment for a contract of such vitalimportance. We had been able to afford sums of that order for less important objectives. We should be well repaid if such a commit-ment led to reduced tension in the Middle East.(cl) On the other hand, we had not been able to provide all the guarantees that were asked of us for important schemes of this naturein other Commonwealth countries. While Commonwealth countries would doubtless understand the need for exceptional guarantees to egypt at the present time, it would be easier to justify our action tothem if a substantial part of the burden was to be carried by theInternational Bank.(e) The time had now come to discuss the question of financial risks and the problems to which they gave rise with the French andGerman Governments, particularly the latter, which was known tobe specially interested in this scheme.The Prime Minister said that, in spite of the various complica-tions which had arisen, it must remain a matter of the greatestnational importance that this project should be undertaken by theEuropean consortium. Nevertheless, the scale of the financial risknow seen to be involved was disturbing and he agreed that a further attempt must be made to obtain financial support from the american continent.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the conclusion in CP. (55) 168 that, in view of the magnitude of the financial risks involved, every effort should be made to secure additional guarantors for theAswan High Dam project.(2) Agreed that, pending the outcome of the forthcoming visit of the Egyptian Minister of Finance, we should restrictour efforts to an attempt to induce the International Bankto provide financial support for the project, butauthorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to inform theUnited States Administration of the action we were taking.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be guided by thepoints made in their discussion at his forthcoming meeting with the Egyptian Minister of Finance.
(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, to arrange for early consultations with the French and german governments on the problems involved in the financing of the Aswan project.ImplicationsOj  Full;Employment.(previous references:CM. (55) 31stConclusions,Minute 3, and cm. (55) 32ndConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the draft white paper on Industrial Relations (CP. (55) 123) had now been revised to take account of the views, expressed by the Cabinet in their previous discussion and to meet detailed, comments which individual ministers had made. It would not be advisable to publish this white paper at once, but he thought it might be useful to issue it in abouta month&apos;s time, as a means of showing that economic stability couldnot be achieved in conditions of full employment without some degreeof restraint in industrial relations and wage claims.The statement which the leaders of the Trades Union Congress(TU.C.) had issued immediately after their meeting on 1st Novemberwith the, Prime Minister showed that this need was not fully realised.On the other hand, it could at least be claimed that the statementdid not positively encourage wage claims. He proposed to considerwhether contact between the Government and the T.U.C. could be improved, perhaps by changes in the composition and procedure ofthe Economic Planning Board.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate fortheir consideration a revised version of the draft white paper on Industrial Relations.colonial immigrants.(previous reference:CM. (55) 31stConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (55) 166) covering a draft of a Bill to control the entry into the United Kingdom of British subjects from overseas anddiscussing the issues which would have to be settled before such legislation could be introduced. They also had before them amemorandum by the Colonial Secretary (CP. (55) 167) recommending that, if such legislation were introduced, it should extend to Britishsubjects from all Commonwealth countries and should not be confined to those from Colonial territories.The Home Secretary said that, if it were decided to take powerto. control this immigration, the main questions were whether thelegislation should apply to all British subjects from overseas or onlyto those from the Colonies, and whether it should extend to citizens ofthe Irish Republic. Although the need for such powers arose mainly from the rapid increase in immigration from the West Indies,legislation limited to Colonial immigrants would be regarded asracial discrimination and would be particularly objectionable to theWest Indies. Moreover, legislation limited in this way would become less effective as Colonial territories achieved independence. Though20,000 immigrants had come to this country in 1955 from the west indies, immigration from India and Pakistan was running at the rateof six or. seven thousand a year. There would be great practical difficulty in applying the control to citizens of the Irish Republic, butimmigration from that quarter was considerable. It was estimatedthat 750,000 Irish had immigrated into the United Kingdom since theend of the war; and nearly 60,000 had registered for national insurance in twelve months up to the middle of 1955.The Home Secretary said that under the draft legislation whichhe had circulated the main criteria for admission were employment and housing; immigrants could be refused entry unless they couldsatisfy the Immigration Officer that authorised employment wasawaiting them and that satisfactory housing accommodation was available for them and their dependants.
The Colonial Secretary said that legislation limited to colonial immigrants would certainly be criticised as racial discrimination. Itwould have a particularly unfortunate effect on our relations with theWest Indies, and might well prejudice the future association of theproposed West Indian Federation with the Commonwealth. In anycase it was very doubtful whether legislation in the form proposed would be effective. Though the immigrant would be required to prove on entry that employment and accommodation were awaitinghim, there would be no means of ensuring thereafter that he remained in the same area or in the same job. His own view wasthat it would be inexpedient to impose this sort of control at thepresent time, and that the preferable course was for the Governmentto try by other means to disperse the Colonial immigrants moreevenly over the United Kingdom.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The problem of Colonial immigration had not yet arousedgeneral public anxiety, although there was some concern, mainly due to housing difficulties, in a few localities where most of the recentimmigrants were concentrated. On the other hand, if immigration from the Colonies, and, for that matter, from India and Pakistan,were allowed to continue unchecked, there was a real danger that overthe years there would be a significant change in the racial characterof the English people.(b) All the Colonies had power to control the immigration ofBritish subjects into their territories. They should not regard it asunreasonable if the United Kingdom took power to apply similarrestrictions.As against this it was argued that such a step would be inconsistent with the traditional policy that British subjects shouldhave the right of free entry into the Mother country of theCommonwealth, and would be widely regarded as an illiberaldevelopment.(c) On economic grounds immigration, including Colonialimmigration, was a welcome means of augmenting our labourresources. It was the condition of full employment here that wasattracting these immigrants. The Trades Union Congress were, ingeneral, averse to the imposition of restrictions on Colonial immigra-tion, although individual Unions might well take a different line.(d) If powers were to be taken to control the entry of Britishsubjects from overseas, it seemed desirable that similar restrictions\ should be applied to citizens of the Irish Republic.  But, apart from the fact that we needed Irish labour, it would be impracticable tocontrol immigration from the Irish Republic without applyingrestrictions to travel between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.(e) Consideration might be given to the possibility of admittingColonial immigrants for temporary employment for a period notexceeding five years. This might meet the present need for labour with less prejudice to long-term social conditions.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was evident that further thought must be given to this problem beforethe Cabinet could decide whether legislation should be introduced onthe lines indicated in CP. (55) 166.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would consider how theproblem   of   Colonial  immigration   should   be  further examined.
