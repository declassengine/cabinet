Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the opening days of the new Parliament.It was hoped that debate on the current industrial disputes mightbe completed before the end of the present week. The Debate on the address could then be resumed in the following week and completed on 16th June.Four-power talks.(previous reference:CM. (55) 6thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Cabinet were informed that, since their last discussion on this subject, agreement had been reached between the Governmentsof the United Kingdom, United States and France on the terms of an invitation to the Soviet Government to attend a meeting of the fourHeads of Governments. The three Western Powers had further agreed to propose that this meeting should be held in Geneva from18th to 21st July; and this proposal had now been formallycommunicated to the Soviet Government.Industrial 3.   The Minister of Labour said that on the previous day the disputes. Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) had published the followingRailways.       proposals for settling the railway strike:  (Previous (i) The question of differentials should be referred for futureReference: joint discussions between the three unions concerned.CM.(55) 11th (ii) The National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.) should agreeConclusions, that the Transport Commission might start discussionsMinute 1.) with the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and firemen (A.S.L.E.F.) on the settlement of the dispute onfootplatemen&apos;s pay on the understanding that the N.U.R.would be consulted before any settlement was reached,(hi) A.S.L.E.F. should agree to meet the Transport commission with a view to establishing absolute minimum increases to settle the dispute, bearing in mind the proposed discussions on differentials, and to agree to consider a return to work as soon as a settlement emerged,(iv) If agreement could be reached on this basis the TUG. would themselves press the Prime Minister to agree that negotiations should begin while the strike continued.The Minister of Labour said that these proposals wereunsatisfactory in various respects. Thus, the Transport Commissionmust take part in any discussions on differentials; the N.U.R., whorepresented a proportion of the footplate grades, must take partthroughout in any discussions about the pay of footplatemen; andthere could be no question of resuming formal negotiations whilethe strike continued. Until the strike was called off, all that waspossible was a continuance of informal discussions designed toestablish a basis for resumed negotiation.The Minister said that, when he saw representatives of the T.U.C.that afternoon, he would point out the objections to their proposals and express his regret that they had not consulted him beforepublishing them. He also proposed, before the strike was debated inParliament, to have a further discussion with representatives ofA.S.L.E.F. for the purpose of taking stock of the position.The following points were raised in discus sion;  (a) If the T.U.C.&apos;s proposals were accepted by the Unions, theGovernment would have the onus of rejecting them.   Early action should therefore be taken to explain to the public the objections tothe T.U.C.&apos;s plan.48025-4 B 2
(b) There could be no question of abandoning the principle thatformal negotiations could not be resumed while the strike continued.But it was important to ensure that the public understood the distinction between formal negotiations and informal discussionsdesigned to establish a basis for negotiations. The Prime Minister had made it clear in his broadcast on 5th June that the Government were ready to do everything in their power to facilitate discussions whichwould lead to a resumption of negotiations, and this should beforcibly presented to the public.(c) While the problem of wage differentials in railwayemployment was a matter for discussion between the transport commission and the three Unions concerned, there would be advantage in bringing it home to the public that the Commission^latest proposals involved more pronounced differentials than theUnions themselves had favoured and also that A.S.L.E.F. were notconsistent in their attitude in this matter. Thus, they were at one andthe same time demanding differentials between the pay of the gradeswhich they represented and of those represented by the N.U.R. and,so far as concerned the grades which they represented, were opposingdifferentials between man and man based on degrees of skill and responsibility.(d) The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet of the extent towhich essential supplies and services were being maintained.The Prime Minister said that the Home Secretary and the other ministers concerned were to be congratulated on the success whichhad so far attended their efforts to this end.(e) The Home Secretary said that on the previous day he had discussed with representatives of the Jockey Club whether racemeetings should be held in the vicinity of London. They had agreedthat, if the strike continued, the forthcoming meeting at Sandownshould be cancelled and the Ascot Royal Meeting should, with the queen&apos;s approval, be postponed. They would be issuing anannouncement to this effect later in the day.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to arrange for suitableguidance to be given to the press on the objections to theT.U.C.&apos;s proposals and on the other matters covered inthe Cabinefs discussion.(2) Took note of the announcement to be issued by the Stewardsof the Jockey Club about the holding of race meetings inthe vicinity of London.The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation said that the departure of five ocean liners from Liverpool and Southampton was delayed by strikes among members of the crews. There was now a threat of a strike by sections of the crew of the &quot; Queen Elizabeth,&quot;which was due to sail for New York on 9th June. The master of the vessel was doing his utmost to keep the vesseFs crew in being, andthe National Union of Seamen were co-operating with him. Theremust, however, be some anxiety both about this vessel and about otherocean liners due to leave this country within the next few days.The Cabinet were informed that the B.B.C. had not been helpful in their references to these strikes in news bulletins, which had tended to give a distorted impression of the numbers of seamen who wererefusing to carry out their normal duties. Suitable representations on this point might be made to the Director-General of the B.B.C.The Cabinet (3) Took note of these statements on the strikes by members ofthe crews of ocean liners.
Parliament. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeEmergencies Secretary (CP. (55) 29) inviting them to consider whether the lawduring should be amended so as to enable Parliament to be convened if a dissolution. sudden emergency arose during a period of dissolution.The Home Secretary said that attention had been drawn to thispoint by the need to make a proclamation of emergency immediatelyafter the General Election. It was possible that, when the emergencywas debated in Parliament, it might be suggested that,the law shouldbe altered so as to make it possible, if an emergency arose during a dissolution, to advance the date originally fixed for the assemblyof a new Parliament. If such legislation were contemplated, theopportunity might be taken to modify Section 3 of the Meeting ofParliament Act, 1797, which provided that on a demise of the Crownduring a period of dissolution the old Parliament should be convenedand continue, unless again dissolved, for six months. It was arguable that this procedure should apply only when a demise of the Crownoccurred between dissolution and polling-day. In theory there oughtalso to be power to recall the old Parliament in the event of a suddenemergency other than a demise of the Crown between dissolution andpolling-day; but it would be difficult to define the circumstances inwhich such a discretion could properly be exercised and a proposal totake such a power was likely to be controversial.In discussion it was pointed out that the present emergency,while it had drawn attention to the fact that there was no power to advance the date fixed for the assembly of a new Parliament after aGeneral Election, had not shown any striking practical need for sucha power. The primary responsibility for handling an emergencyarising from an industrial dispute lay with the Executive, and aGovernment remained in office even though Parliament was dissolved.From the experience of the last few days, it could be argued that, evenif such an emergency arose during a period of dissolution, theGovernment could handle the situation during the few days beforethe new Parliament was due to meet. There seemed, therefore, tobe no reason why the Government should take the initiative in proposing that power should be taken to advance the date fixed forthe assembly of a new Parliament after a General Election. there seemed even less reason to propose amendment of Section 3 of theMeeting of Parliament Act, 1797. If these points were raised in theforthcoming debate in the House of Commons, the government spokesman could undertake that they would be considered, but no promise should be given at this stage that amending legislation would-     be introduced.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Government should not take the initiative in proposing amending legislation to facilitate the earliermeeting of Parliament on an emergency arising during a dissolution; but agreed to review this question further inthe light of any representations which might be made in theforthcoming debate in the House of Commons on the currentr    emergency.industrial relations.(previous reference:CM. (55) 11thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumby the Minister of Labour (CP. (55) 25) on possible means of checkingunofficial strikes and improving industrial relations.The main points made in the discussion were as follows:  (a) An irresponsible attitude towards industrial disputes couldjeopardise the continuance of a democratic system. It was this attitude which in other countries had opened the way for a Fascistrevolution. Though the Government must be careful not toantagonise the workers, they must not ignore the mounting impatienceof other sections of the community.
(b) Wise action with a view to improving industrial relationswould at the moment command a wide measure of public support.It was unlikely that the Government would find a more favourable opportunity than this for taking such action; and they should beready to seize the opportunity before it passed.(c) On the other hand there was room for further education ofpublic opinion. e.g.,&apos;on the economics of full employment and the role of trade unions in a modern society. In this connection theFinancial Secretary, Treasury, suggested that further consideration might now be given to the project of issuing a White Paper on wages.The Minister of Education said that he would like to discuss withthe Minister of Labour the suggestions in paragraph 10 of CP.(55) 25 on the provision of educational facilities. He was not sure that his predecessors had given sufficient encouragement toeducational courses, for workers, in economics, trade unionhistory, &amp;c.(d) The holding of a general enquiry by a Royal Commission orother independent body, as suggested in paragraph 6 of CP. (55) 25,would help to shape public opinion and to enlist trade union support for remedial action. On the other hand, if the enquiry wereprotracted., the favourable opportunity for action might have passed before the report was received. This dilemma might be avoided byselecting some matters for early action and others for investigation.(e) Current difficulties were partly due to the fact that full employment had distorted the relative power of the parties tocollective bargaining. Full employment had also removed the oldsanction for discipline in industry. If full employment continued,other means would have to be sought of preserving a due sense ofresponsibility among the workers.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to appoint a small CabinetCommittee to consider in further detail the issues raised byCP. (55) 25 and to submit for the Cabinefs considerationproposals for early action on this problem.Kenya. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a further memorandum bySurrender the Colonial Secretary (CP. (55) 30) on the proposal that heavierOffer. sanctions should be applied to Mau Mau terrorists who failed to take(Previous advantage of the current surrender offer before its expiration on reference:        10th July.CM. (55) 11th The Colonial Secretary said that he was satisfied that some further conclusions, sanction was required to induce the remaining terrorists to surrender,Minute 5.) an(j deprivation of land rights would be the most effectivesanction for this purpose. In the telegram annexed to CP. (55) 30(Kenya telegram No. 629) the Governor of Kenya set out arguments in favour of the proposal that terrorists who failed to surrender bythat date should suffer, not only forfeiture of existing rights to land,but disqualification for future acquisition of land or land rights. Theproposal for disqualification would have particular influence onyoung terrorists, who had not yet acquired land or rights to land,and was also likely to influence women in the reserves to induceterrorists to surrender. The Colonial Secretary said that these were strong arguments. On the other hand, he recognised the force ofthe objections which his colleagues had urged against the proposal fordisqualification. He therefore recommended that, for the present atany rate, the new sanction should be limited to forfeiture of existing rights to land. Hitherto, the Forfeiture of Land Ordinance, 1953,had been applied only to a limited number of notorious leaders:individual orders had to be made against each, and the order had to specify the land to which the forfeiture applied. Under the plan which he now recommended, forfeiture of existing land rights would beapplied more generally. Orders would be made applving to numbersof individuals named in a schedule, and having the effect of depriving
Monopolies amiflRestrictivePractices.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 16thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (CP. (55) 28) outlining his present policy onmonopolies and restrictive practices.The President of the Board of Trade said that the present policy was one of full enquiry followed by resolute action where this was shown to be necessary. He had already acted on seven reports andhad promised action on the report on Calico Printers. The recent report on collective boycott and exclusive dealing was being printedand would require careful consideration. It was proposed to refer to the Monopolies Commission the cotton yarn spinners&apos; ring, and hethem of all their existing land rights without specifying the particularrights possessed by each. This would go some way towards providing the further sanction which the Kenya Government thought necessary.It would not satisfy them; for it would not bring any special influence to bear on the younger terrorists or on the women; and it was likely that, if this limited sanction did not result in widespread surrenders,the Kenya Government would at a later stage press their demand for authority to take more drastic measures.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were disposed to accept the limited recommendation now put forward by the Colonial Secretary.Discussion turned mainly on the terms of the announcement proposedby the Governor in his telegram No. 624. It was pointed out thatthe fifth paragraph of this draft announcement might give theimpression that land forfeiture was to be applied even more widelythan was in fact proposed. It failed to bring out the fact thatforfeiture would be applied only to named individuals. Moreover,the statement that &quot; their land and land rights will not pass to their families or relatives &quot; was too categorical if, as the Colonial secretary had explained, it was contemplated that in some cases the land wouldbe transferred to a relative of known loyalty. These points could bemet if the fifth paragraph of the draft statement were amended on thefollowing lines:  &quot; Those terrorists who fail to take advantage of presentsurrender offer and continue to resist forces of law and orderafter 10th July will be liable to forfeiture of all their existingland and land rights in native lands, including their rights to share and occupy clan land. The Forfeiture of Land Ordinance,1953, will be amended so as to enable an Order to be madedepriving all persons named in a schedule to the Order of all their existing land and land rights.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the current surrender offer to Mau Mau terroristsin Kenya should remain in force until 10th July unless themilitary situation should make it necessary to terminate itearlier, and should then be withdrawn.(2) Agreed that terrorists who failed to take advantage of the surrender offer before the date of its withdrawal shouldbe liable to forfeit all their existing land and land rights,including rights to share and occupy clan land; and thatthe Forfeiture of Land Ordinance, 1953, should be amended so as to enable an Order to be made deprivingall persons named in a schedule to the Order of all theirexisting land and land rights.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to authorise the Governor of kenya to take action in accordance with Conclusions (1)and (2) above, but to ask that the final paragraph of thedraft announcement set out in his telegram No. 624should be amended on the lines suggested in the cabinets discussion.
was in touch with those of his colleagues concerned about possible future references to the Commission in respect of chemical fertilisers,batteries and accumulators, and the metal box industry. TheMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was also considering thepossibility of referring one food industry to the Commission the fishing industry or the tea trade and he was also in touch with theMinister of Works about the cement industry.In discussion it was suggested that reference of any industry tothe Commission inevitably implied some suspicion of its activities, and support was expressed for the view that references should only bemade where there were prima facie grounds for suspecting theexistence of some undesirable form of organisation or practice. the managements of concerns investigated by the Monopolies commission were obliged to devote much time and energy to the defence of their organisation and practices; and it was undesirable that they should be compelled to divert their energies from the promotion of their exporttrade unless there was full justification for an investigation. nor should it be made to appear that an industry like the cement industry,which had been developed to a high pitch of efficiency and producedthe cheapest cement in the world, was guilty ex hypothesi of followingundesirable practices.On the other hand, the view was expressed that, if industry and commerce were to be left to private enterprise, machinery shouldexist for investigating alleged defects of that system. The existingMonopolies and Restrictive Practices Act provided for the holding ofan enquiry where there were grounds for alleging that a monopolyexisted or a restrictive practice operated, and the procedure under theAct could be clearly distinguished from the anti-trust laws in theUnited States which contained features which were far moredistasteful to industrial concerns than anything in our law. If, as seemed probable, the future of industry lay with the large concern,there must be a ready means of satisfying the public that large-scaleorganisations did not necessarily work to their disadvantage.The suggestion was made that Opposition criticism on thissubject in the forthcoming Debate on the Address should be answeredmainly by comparing the Governments record with that of their predecessors in office, and that the Government should not be committed to further large-scale action until the Cabinet had had afurther opportunity of considering the matter.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their consideration of CP. (55) 28 at alater meeting.Ministry of 8.   The Minister of Housing and Local Government said thatHousing and there would be some advantage in altering the present name of hisLocal Department to &quot; Ministry of Local Government.&quot; Its present nameGovernment. was cumbersome and was often abbreviated to &quot; Ministry of housing &quot;; and this title was becoming increasingly inappropriate asthe emphasis in house building came to be transferred to building by private enterprise with which the Department had little concern.The name &quot; Ministry of Local Government&quot; would appropriately1 cover all the activities of the Department.In discussion it was pointed out that the change proposed wouldbe taken to imply that the Government attached less importance tothe provision of housing for the people. There was general agreement that, for this reason, this was not an appropriate moment at which tomake this change.The Cabinet Agreed that no change should be made for the present inthe name of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government.
Departmental 9.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorRecords. of the Exchequer (CP. (55) 17) on the report of the Committee on(Previous        Departmental Records (Cmd. 9163).Reference: The memorandum recalled that the Cabinet had deferred aC.C. (55) 20th decision on the recommendations of this Committee pending further conclusions, consideration of the proposal that Cabinet records should be madeMinute 4.) available for public inspection after fifty years. Difficulties might,however, arise from further delay in carrying into effect theCommittee&apos;s other recommendations, particularly those relating tothe reorganisation of the Public Record Office. Authority wastherefore sought to proceed with these other matters on the lines proposed in C. (55) 16, on the understanding that this would not prejudice further consideration of the problem of opening Cabinetrecords to public inspection.The Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give effect tosuch of the recommendations of the Committee onDepartmental Records as could be brought into operation without prejudicing the Cabinefs further considerationof the question when Cabinet records should be madeavailable for public inspection.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th June, 1955.
