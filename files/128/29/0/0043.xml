1.

The Minister of Agriculture reported to the Cabinet that theUnited Kingdom had failed to obtain re-election to the seat on theExecutive Council of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (F.A.O.)which, as a leading supporter and contributor, we might reasonably expect to occupy and had occupied since the Organisation was firstset up.

Middle East.(previous reference:CM. (55) 36thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the situation in theMiddle bast.The Foreign Secretary said that the Bagdad Pact represented the&quot; grand design &quot; in our Middle East policy, within which we must seek a solution to the particular problem of the dispute betweenIsrael and Egypt. We were fully committed to the Bagdad Pact andit was essential that we should make a success of it. Our main effort should now be directed to bringing Jordan into the Pact as quickly as possible. This would inevitably entail a revision of our treaty with that country in favour of a less tutelary instrument and weshould have to make some concessions, although we should try tokeep these to a minimum. There was some reason to hope that ifJordan joined the Pact she would be followed by the Lebanon. Anearly settlement of the dispute between Israel and Egypt was nowindispensable, if it could be achieved, in order to create the conditionsin which Russia&apos;s attempt to establish her influence in the middle east might be checked and progressively reduced. The PrimeMinister^ speech on 9th November had been very favourablyreceived in the Arab countries, although these countries had naturallytended to fasten exclusively upon the references to the United Nationsresolutions of 1947 regarding the frontiers of Israel; The next step,in regard to this dispute, was to induce first the Egyptian and then the Israeli Government to agree upon a basis for discussion whichmight open the way to settlement. If this dispute could be broughtto an end, conditions would be created in which Egypt mightgradually and properly resume her leading position among the arab countries and a prospect would be opened for the Northern Tier Pactto spread downwards towards the Nile. In these efforts it would be reasonable to look to the United States to take the majorresponsibility for bringing the Israelis to a reasonable frame of mind and. for us to undertake a similar responsibility with regard to theArab countries.The Foreign Secretary said that he had been impressed, during his visit to the Middle East, with the corrupt influence, of SaudiArabia supported by immense oil revenues which, when notsquandered improvidentfy, were being used to seduce neighbouring arab States. The Saudi Arabians were irresponsibly indifferent tothe fact that the corrupting policies they pursued in their hatred ofthe Hashemite dynasties opened the door still wider to the spread of Communist influence in the Near East. The Arab States werebeing subjected to an undermining process which they could notindefinitely withstand. This made it the more urgent that we should press our own policies to a successful conclusion.The Prime Minister said that no time should be lost in taking advantage of the indications that the Egyptian Government might now be disposed to collaborate in an approach, of the kind whichhad been outlined, to the problem of securing a settlement of the would cause the smaller countries to reconsider the wisdom: of. their approach to these matters. A reduction in our subscription to theF.A.O. might even be considered, but it was to be noted that therepresentative bodies of the farming industry in this country were anxious that the United Kingdom should belong to this Organisation.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture to be guided by their discussion in taking appropriate steps to promote a greatersense of responsibility among the smaller nations represented on the Food and Agriculture Organisation.
Muscat andthe Oman.(previous reference :CC. (55) 33rdConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet were informed of the measures which wereplanned to support certain operations proposed by the Sultan of muscat against the Imam of Oman. The Defence Committee had recommended that there should be no further delay in launchingthe proposed operations and in affording the support required.The Cabinet considered whether, and if so at what time, theUnited States Government should be informed of these operations.It was pointed out that since, unlike the operations at Buraimi, theaction now proposed would not affect the American oil companies,the United States Government might feel less concern on this occasion. The measures which were planned to support the Sultan&apos;operations could be justified as necessary to fulfil our treaty obligations to the Sultan. The Foreign Secretary said that he would consider further the question of informing the United StatesGovernment about the proposed action.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the recommendation of the Defence Committeethat the proposed operations in the Trucial Oman shouldbe launched as soon as possible.(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would consider further the question of informing the United States Government.Industrialites.Rolls RoyceFactoriesin Scotland.(previous reference :CM. (55) 41stConclusions,Minute 12.)5. The Minister of Labour said that the prospects for asettlement of the strike at the Rolls Royce factories in Scotland hadreceded. A few days ago, following discussion at a meeting of theGeneral Iron Fitters&apos; Association, it had looked as if work mightbe resumed. But, as reported in the newspapers that morning, therepresentatives of unions with members involved in the strike had now recommended that the thirteen unions concerned should recognise the strike officially and had appointed a committee of fiveto negotiate with the employers. Unfortunately little confidencecould be reposed in this committee, for three of its members werepolitically unreliable. A meeting between the unions and theemployers was now likely. The basis of the strike had, however,changed. It was no longer concerned with the dispute which had arisen over the refusal of one employee to honour an informalagreement to limit bonus earnings but, the man having been expelledfrom his union, was now concerned with the employment of non-unionists. His Department would be in touch with further develop-ments but the employers, who had taken the line that there was as yet no basis for conciliation, had not invited him to intervene.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.dispute with Israel. It was important that the preparatory steps should be completed before renewed hostility towards a settlement could develop in Israel.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the statements made by thePrime Minister and the Foreign Secretary.
Road and 6.   The Cabinet were informed that the British TransportRaiJ Commission proposed to apply in the near future to the TransportTransport. Tribunal for a substantial increase in fares on the London TransportLondon Fares   Unes, trie London lines of British Railways and also on London buses.These proposals would be the direct result of the recent wage award(Previous        to bus staffs.  This was likely to cost  3 millions a year and, on the reference:      present basis, London Transport net revenue was likely to show aC.C. (54) 24th   deficit of  4-4 millions a year. The proposed increases would yieldConclusions,     an increased annual revenue of about  4 millions.  It would now be minute 1.)       necessary to raise the minimum 2d. fares and some other fares,including early morning fares, would have to go up. The applicationto the Transport Tribunal would be made shortly and would becomequickly known thereafter.   The Minister of Transport had taken the view&apos; that he would not be justified in intervening.It was pointed out in discussion that it was by no meansunsatisfactory that a close and immediate relationship should beestablished in the public mind between a substantial increase in wages and a consequent increase in fares.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,24th November, 1955.
