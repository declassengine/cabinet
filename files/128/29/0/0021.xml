1. The Cabinet took note that the Greek and Turkish Govern-ments had accepted the invitation to send representatives to aconference in London on political and defence questions affecting theEastern Mediterranean, including Cyprus. The conference was likelyto be held during August. The United Kingdom Government wouldbe represented by the Foreign Secretary, the Minister of Defence and(in the absence of the Colonial Secretary, who would be abroad) theMinister of State for Colonial Affairs.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the arrangements to be made for the conference between representatives of the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, Greece and Turkey on political and defence questions affecting the Eastern Mediterranean.The Colonial Secretary said that he had for some time been anxious to make a short visit to Cyprus and, subject to the Cabinefsviews, he proposed to go there at the end of the week. The local administration had been under severe strain, and he would like to thank them in person for their patience and endurance: in addition,he wished to have an opportunity for personal discussion with theGovernor and members of his Executive Council on questions ofeconomic development and other administrative matters.In discussion doubts were expressed about the expediency of thisproposal. This sudden journey, made while Parliament was sitting,was bound to give rise to speculation. Whatever reason was publiclygiven for the visit, it would be assumed that it was undertaken forpurposes connected with the forthcoming conference; and it might therefore revive demands that the Cypriots should be represented atthe conference. Would the Colonial Secretary, while he was in cyprus, confer with local leaders, including the Archbishop, on con-stitutional questions? If he did so, he might thereby imply that theforthcoming conference would be dealing with matters on which theyshould be consulted: if he did not, he would be open to criticism fromquarters favouring the Cypriot demand for self-determination. Itwas recognised that, if the Archbishop sought an interview with him,he could hardly decline it.The Colonial Secretary agreed that for these reasons this was not an opportune moment for him to visit Cyprus. On the other hand, hispromised visit had been several times postponed and he felt very strongly that, if he postponed it again, he would be failing to give theGovernor and the administration the support which they were entitledto expect from him.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the Colonial Secretary should make a short visit to Cyprus during the next few days, on the understandingthat it would be publicly stated that the purpose of his visit was to discuss with the Governor and members of his executive Council plans for the economic development ofthe Island and other administrative questions.The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of Cyprus had forsome time been anxious to take powers to detain members of aterrorist organisation which was plotting to use violence against, thepolice and other members of the administration. Ten members ofthis organisation had already been arrested and remanded in custody;but,, in default of special powers of detention, it would soon become necessary to release those of them who could not be charged withspecific criminal offences. The Governor wished to break up this organisation by detaining these men and arresting another forty ofits members. He had at first proposed to proceed by declaring a stateof emergency.   It would plainly have been inexpedient to use this
procedure on the eve ofjhe forthcoming conference with representa-tives of the Greek and Turkish Governments; and the Governor had now agreed that the necessary powers could be taken by a special lawenabling him to detain any person whom he believed to have been&quot; active in the furtherance of an organisation which, by its constitutionor propaganda or otherwise, advocates, incites or encourages the overthrow of the constitution of the Colony by revolution or sabotage,or the overthrow by force or violence of the Government, or thedestruction or injury of property of the Crown or of the Government.&quot;He wished to enact this law on 12th or I3th July.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be preferable for the Governor to proceed by this means, rather than bydeclaring a state of emergency. It was, however, desirable that theColonial Secretary should satisfy himself that the Governor hadample evidence to justify the enactment of a measure of this kind especially as the situation in Cyprus had become so much quietersince the announcement of the forthcoming conference. Even if sucha law was still necessary, it was for consideration whether its application might not be limited to the organisation of acts of violence. Was it necessary that it should extend also to the conductof revolutionary propaganda?The Colonial Secretary said that he had wished to discuss these points with the Governor. This was one of the reasons why he hadbeen anxious to visit Cyprus in person. He fully recognised the disadvantages of taking repressive action at this juncture.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to submit to them, after his forthcoming visit to Cyprus, his considered recommenda-tions regarding the measures immediately necessary for the suppression of terrorism in Cyprus.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Minister of Fuel and Power invited the Cabinefs views onthe question whether he should seek an opportunity to explain to the1922 Committee the reasons for the forthcoming increase in coal prices. The Cabinet were informed that the Minister had already explained the need for this increase at a meeting of government supporters interested in fuel and power problems. The Cabinetconcluded that it was unnecessary for the Minister to make a further statement to the 1922 Committee.Monopolies andRestrictivePractices.(previous reference:CM. (55) 20thConclusions,Minute 9.)3. The Cabinet were informed that the Opposition had askedfor an early opportunity to debate in the House of Commons thereport of the Monopolies Commission on collective boycott and exclusive dealing. It was proposed that this debate should be heldon 13th July.The President of the Board of Trade said that, if discussion couldnot be deferred, the Government must either define their attitudetowards the main recommendations of the report or take the line thatthey would be guided by the views expressed in the debate. If they took the second course the Opposition, who would be united insupport of the recommendations of the majority of the Commission,would seize the initiative in the public discussion of this question andit would be difficult for the Government to recapture it. He thereforefavoured the first course.   Government supporters were, however.
divided at present in their attitude towards the report, and theGovernment would need to move quickly if they were to secure before13th July a sufficient body of Conservative support for the view whichhe would recommend. He was satisfied that, both on merits and on grounds of expediency, the Government would have to steer a middle course between the majority and minority reports of the Commission;and he believed that he would be able to persuade a substantial proportion of Government supporters in the House of Commons,before 13th July, that this was the right course to follow. Though itwould not be possible before then to find a satisfactory answer to allthe difficult problems posed by this report, it shotild be possible to devise a general line of approach to those problems which would command the assent of a large majority of Government supporters inthe House. If the Cabinet accepted his view, he would discuss theproblem with some of his colleagues before the weekend and would circulate, for consideration by the Cabinet on 12th July, an outline ofthe statement which he would propose to make in the debate. Afterthe Cabinet had considered this he would have an opportunity for private discussions with Government supporters in the House beforethe debate took place. If this course were followed, it was essentialthat the debate should be held on a Government motion, so thatGovernment spokesmen might take the initiative from the outset.In discussion emphasis was laid on the complexity of the issues raised by this report. Particular reference was made to the difficulties,both theoretical and political, of the problem of re-sale price main-tenance. Was it possible that these difficulties could be resolved intime for the Government to define their attitude towards the report ina debate on 13th July?The President of the Board of Trade said that it would not bepossible within that time to resolve all the problems raised by thereport. It should however be practicable to secure agreement on thegeneral attitude which the Government should adopt towards thereport as a whole. If, of course, the Opposition could be persuaded to defer the debate for a week, this would give him further time forthe consultations which he would like to hold before any public announcement of policy was made.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chief Whip to make a further effort to persuade the leaders of the Opposition to accept postponement ofthis debate on the understanding that it would be held, ona Government motion, in the week beginning 18th July;but agreed that, if this attempt failed, the debate shouldbe held, on a Government motion, on 13th July.(2) Agreed that the Cabinet Committee which they had appointed on 28th June to consider this report by the monopolies Commission should meet at once to discussthe line to be taken by the Government spokesmen in theforthcoming debate, and should submit their recom-mendations for consideration by the Cabinet at their meeting on 12th July.Foreign Affairs.Council ofEurope.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 53rdConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that at the meeting of theCouncil of Europe, from which he had just returned, he had seenindications that some of the smaller European countries might be tempted to place too much confidence in recent Soviet protestationsof goodwill. The peace propaganda of the Soviet Governmentwould make it specially difficult for these Governments to justify totheir people the heavy cost of maintaining their defensive strength.He had thought it wise to make a cautionary reference, at themeeting, to the risk of dismantling defences before danger had passed.
british transport commission.-Disposal ofLorries.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (CP. (55) 62) on the disposal of lorries by theBritish Transport Commission under the Transport Act, 1953.The Minister of Transport said that it was clear that the 8,000general haulage vehicles which now remained could only be disposedof, within the terms of the 1953 Act, in small units. Their disposalin this way would occupy another year or two, and would involvethe break-up of the main trunk services operated by British road services. The break-up of these services would be opposed by asubstantial body of responsible opinion and would, in his view, be unfortunate. Of the five possible courses set out in paragraph .14 of cp. (55) 62, all but the first would require legislation and the first would entail the break-up of the trunk services: The leastunsatisfactory of the others appeared to him to be course (d) underwhich List S.4, comprising over 6,000 vehicles in 160 medium and large units, would be resubmitted for sale together with another listof small units, and it would be announced that these would be thelast lists and that British Road Services would thereafter retain the vehicles which remained unsold.In discussion doubts were expressed about the wisdom of re-submitting List S.4 for sale. If this were a failure, a mostunfavourable impression would be created: if it succeeded, the ruinsof the trunk services would be left in the Commission^ hands. Itmight, therefore, be preferable to halt disposals forthwith, althoughthe Government might in that event be criticised for deprivingprospective buyers of a final opportunity to procure lorries. TheCabinet agreed that there would be little substance in the complaint that those who had already bought lorries had done so in the expectation that they would not have to face competition fromBritish Road Services.The Minister of Transport said that the most acceptable course might be a compromise between (d) and (e) in paragraph 14 of cp. (55) 62, whereby List S.4 would not be re-submitted for sale,but about 1,000 more lorries would be offered in small units. Furthersales on this scale would not seriously affect the trunk services norprovide the Trades Union Congress with ground for seriouscomplaint.  This suggestion met with general support.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, subject to the offering for sale of one furtherlist of small units, the disposal of lorries by the: british transport Commission should now be brought to an end,and that the necessary legislation for this purpose shouldbe introduced in due course.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to submit for their approval the draft of an announcement of this decision,which should be made before Parliament adjourned forthe summer recess.Saar- The Foreign Secretary said that he feared that there was some(Previous possibility that the Saar Agreement might after all be rejected. reference: proposed to delay offering any suggestions regarding the appoint-C.C. (54) 86th ment of a Commissioner until the results of the referendum were conclusions, known. Meanwhile, he would take steps to see that the GermanMinute 1.) Federal Government had clearly in mind the dangerous situationwhich would arise if the Agreement were not accepted.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
(3) Invited the Minister of Transport to agree with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord Privy Seal theform of any interim statement on this matter which he might consider it necessary to make in the debate in theHouse of Commons on 11th July on the annual report ofthe British Transport Commission..6. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the claim byyiee-Admiral J. Hughes Hallett, M.P., that he should receivedamages or compensation shy reason of the fact that he had been ledto suppose by the former Naval Secretary to the First Lord of theAdmiralty that he would be entitled to retired pay at the rate of 1,200 instead of  873 a year.The Lord Chancellor said that he was influenced by threeconsiderations. First,the thought it unlikely that the Admiral would succeed in establishing to the satisfaction of the courts that therewas between him and the Naval Secretary to the First Lord such aspecial relationship of a fiducary nature as to render the Crownresponsible in law for damage resulting from the inaccurate advice which the Naval Secretary had given him. Secondly, it was clear that admiral Hughes Hallett had had an opportunity to minimise the damage to which he had been exposed by withdrawing from his parliamentary candidature at North Croydon, but had not availedhimself of it. Thirdly, it must not be overlooked that, while his loss in retired pay amounted to about  300 a year, Admiral HughesHallett was now drawing, in addition to his retired pay, about  1,280as a Member of Parliament and had good prospects of continuing todo so. In the light of these considerations it was his view that theAdmiraFs claim should be resisted. This need not, however, exclude the possibility that, during the course of legal proceedings, if theywere instituted, it might seem expedient to seek a settlement out of court or to offer arbitration. In his view, however, it would not bedesirable to take either of these courses at this stage.The Attorney-General recalled that the Law Officers, in theirOpinion annexed to CP. (55) 56, had also expressed the view that admiral Hughes Halletfs claim ought on its merits to be resisted,and that it was because of the legal doubts which existed that theyhad recommended that a settlement should be sought.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he greatly regretted the necessity of involving his former Naval Secretary in legal proceedings and for this reason he would have preferred that somesettlement of the claim should be sought.The Cabinet Agreed that Admiral Hughes Hallett should be left to seek a remedy in the courts for his claim to damages by reasonof the inaccurate advice given to him by the former NavalSecretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty.Retirement of-YiceTAdmiralJ. HughesHallett.(previous reference:CM. (55) 20thConclusions,Minute 3.)housing subsidies.(previous references:C.C. (54) 54thConclusions,Minute 3 and cm. (55) 20thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had considered the suggestion, made at the Cabinefs last meeting, thathe should postpone the proposed increase in the rate of interest on public Works Loans. He was satisfied that postponement was not practicable. Local authorities which could raise money on themarket were taking advantage of the lower rates of interest obtain-able from the Public Works Loans Board, and he could not allowthis situation to continue.The Minister of Housing said that he would at once be askedwhether the level of housing subsidies would be raised on account of
this increase in the rate of interest charged by the Public works loans Board. This question could be answered in the negative; buthe would like, in addition, to give some indication that the Govern-ment were reviewing the whole question of housing subsidies. Astatement to that effect would provoke public discussion, whichwould help to prepare the way for a later announcement that the subsidies were to be reduced. It would also make it easier for him to open general discussions on housing subsidies with the localauthority associations.In discussion some doubts were expressed about the expediency of provoking public discussion about housing subsidies before theGovernment had finally formulated their policy on this question.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would arrange for the rate of interest on Public Works Loans tobe increased during the following week.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government tosubmit  for  their  consideration  a  memorandum  on housing subsidies.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7 th July, 1955.
