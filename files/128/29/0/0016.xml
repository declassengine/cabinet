Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet agreed that, in the debate in - the House ofCommons on industrial relations on 23rd June, the Minister ofLabour should speak first on the Governments behalf and theParliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour should reply to the debate.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was due to answer on 23rd June a Question asking whether a second Budget and finance bill would be introduced during the current financial year. It would,it was true, be convenient if an opportunity could be found to enactbefore next year some of the technical provisions which would havebeen included in the Finance Bill if it had not been necessary, on political grounds, to restrict its scope so narrowly. He was not,however, anxious to have a major Parliamentary review of financialand economic questions in the autumn; and he was considering whether it would be practicable to include some of these technicalprovisions in a Bill other than the Finance Bill. He proposed to say,in reply to the Question, that he was not disposed to favour the ideaof a second Finance Bill during the current financial year.Crown Lands. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (55) 40) covering the report of a Committee which had reviewed the organisation for the management of Crown Lands.The Prime Minister said that the main proposal of the Committeewas that the management of Crown Lands should in future beentrusted to a Board of Trustees, most of whom would devote only part of their time to this work. It was recommended that theadministrative head of the organisation should initially be deputy chairman of the Board, and that he should be an administrativeCivil Servant rather than a surveyor or land agent. If the cabinet approved these recommendations the Government could, whenpublishing the Committee&apos;s report, announce their acceptance ofthe proposal for a Board of Trustees and proceed with the choice of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman, who could be appointed inthe first instance as Commissioners under the existing legislation.In discussion general approval was expressed for the new formof organisation recommended in the Committee&apos;s report. It waspointed out that Ministerial responsibility for the new Board of trustees would need to be determined in due course.Colonial 1.   The Prime Minister said that he was due to answer thatImmigrants.     afternoon a Parliamentary Question by Mr. C. Osborne, M.P., asking(Previous        whether the problem of immigration into this country from JamaicaReference:      would be discussed with the Chief Minister of Jamaica while he wasCM. (55) 14th  in London.  He proposed to reply that, while the Colonial SecretaryConclusions,    would take this opportunity of discussing appropriate aspects of this minute 4.)       problem with the Chief. Minister of Jamaica, the regulation of immigration into this country remained the responsibility of theUnited Kingdom Government.  He proposed to add that he had nofurther statement to make on this subject.  He invited the Cabinefsviews on the question whether an answer in these terms was likelyto give the impression that the Government had no intention of taking action to control immigration into this country by Britishsubjects from overseas.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be preferable that the Prime Minister should not appear to exclude the possibility that the Government might be able to take such action at a later stage. It was therefore agreed that the Prime Minister should endhis reply by saying that he had no further statement to make on thissubject at the present time.
4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the colonial secretary (CP. (55) 48) about a recent incident in the Western aden protectorate in which a combined convoy of Aden Protectorate leviesand Government guards, which had been taking replacements and stores to the garrison at Robat Fort, had.been ambushed by Rabizirebels and suffered heavy casualities.The Colonial Secretary said that this incident served to emphasise the seriousness of the position in the Western Aden protectorate and the need for the various counter-measures described in his memorandum CP. (55) 47.The Prime Minister said that, before this memorandum wasconsidered by the Cabinet, the Minister of Defence should discussthe military implications of this latest incident with the Chiefs ofStaff. Although the convoy had had ample air cover, no armoured cars had been available to give it protection on land.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Defence to discuss with the Chiefs ofStaff the military implications of the incident reportedin CP. (55) 48.(2) Agreed to consider the Colonial Secretary&apos;s memorandum cp. (55) 47 at an early meeting.Aden.Security of the protectorate.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 48thConclusions,Minute 1.)industrial disputes.Ocean Liners.(previous reference:CM. (55) 15thConclusions,Minute 3.)x5. The Minister of Labour said that a Private Notice question was to be put to him in the House of Commons that afternoon byMr. D. G. Logan, M.P., asking whether young members of the crews of ocean liners who had gone on strike could secure continuingexemption from military service if they returned to sea service. Hewould have no difficulty in answering that Question; for, if any ofthese men resumed employment as seamen before the process of calling them up for military service had been completed, their call-upwould be again deferred. His Department was proceeding on thebasis that deferment was granted to a merchant seaman so longas he remained in sea service but was withdrawn when he left that service, for whatever cause he left it. For this purpose his department relied on the certificate of the responsible authority that a man was no longer following the calling of a merchant seaman.Any doubts that might be entertained about this procedure wouldrelate, not to the action taken by his Department, but to the basis on which the Merchant Navy Establishment Pool were assuming that men who had been on strike for fourteen days had left theindustry. It was this assumption that might give rise to the questionwhether a merchant seaman had a right to strike.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the strikers whohad so far been notified by the Establishment Pool as having left the industry were all men who had left their ships, or declined tore-join their ships, in breach of their articles. Could it be claimed that a seaman had a right to strike in breach of his articles?The Cabinet agreed that both the facts and the law on this point should be established without delay, in case the question should beraised in the course of the debate on industrial relations which wasto be held in the House of Commons on 23rd June.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the new form of organisation for themanagement of Crown Lands which was recommended in the report annexed to CP. (55) 40.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theCommittee&apos;s report to be presented to Parliament as a command Paper.
1Docks.(previous reference :CM. (55) 9thConclusions,Minute 1.)Austria. 6.   The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Nutting) said(Previous        that the Foreign Secretary was anxious that Parliament should ratifyReference:      the Austrian Treaty before the expiry of the period of 21 days duringCM. (55) 7th    which it was customary for the drafts of treaties to be availableConclusions,    to Parliament before ratification.   It had been ascertained that the minute 3.)       Labour Opposition in the House of Commons would raise noobjection to this.   It was, however, for consideration whether theTreaty could properly be ratified before Parliament had passed thelegislation required to bring United Kingdom law into line with therequirements of the Treaty.The Attorney-General recalled that Lord SWinton had stated onbehalf of the Government in the House of Lords on 11th March,1953, that, where a treaty could not be carried out without legislation,the legislation should be passed between the time when the treaty was signed and the time when it was ratified, as the Government were not entitled to assume in advance that the necessary legislation would prove acceptable to Parliament.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, having regard to\ that statement, the enabling Bill should be passed before the Austrian treaty was ratified. The necessary Orders in Council could then bemade as soon as possible thereafter.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Austrian Treaty should be ratified by theUnited Kingdom at the earliest possible date.(2) Agreed that, before ratification, the necessary enablinglegislation should be carried through Parliament.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for this enablinglegislation to be prepared forthwith and passed into lawas soon as possible.Broadcasting.The fortnight rule.(previous reference:CC. (54) 44thConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Lord Privy Seal recalled that before the General Electionthe Cabinet had agreed that formal directions should, if necessary,be issued to the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) under clause 15(4) of their licence to ensure: (i) the maintenance of the rule whereby the B.B.C. were precluded from broadcastingdiscussions or ex parte statements on any issue during a period of a fortnight before it was debated in either House of Parliament; andThe Cabinet (1) Invited the Attorney-General to consider, and to report tothe Cabinet at their next meeting, to what extent the rightof a seaman to withhold his labour was qualified by hisobligations under the Merchant Shipping Act; and, onthe basis of a factual statement to be provided by theMinister of Transport, whether the procedure adoptedin the present strike by the Merchant Navy EstablishmentPool could be held to be inconsistent with that right.The Minister of Labour said that members of the London Branchof the Stevedores Union were likely to be advised, at a meeting tobe held that evening, to return to work. If the London members ofthe Union resumed work this might help towards a settlement ofthe more difficult situation on Merseyside.A zneeting of the Disputes Committee of the Trades UnionCongress was to be held on 24th June. This would provide a further opportunity for conciliation between the two Unions.The Cabinet (2) Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.
(ii) the rejection of a proposal by the National Broadcasting council for Wales to institute Party political broadcasts on Welsh affairs.It had been ascertained that the Labour Opposition would supportthe issue of formal directions to the B.B.C. on both points. Thesupport of the Liberal Party was not likely to be secured. If theCabinet should still consider that such directions were necessary, thePostmaster-General would now proceed to issue them.The Postmaster-General said that the Chairman of the NationalBroadcasting Council for Wales was due to see him on the following day and was likely to make a further appeal to the Government to reconsider their opposition to the proposal for Party political broadcasts on Welsh affairs. There was a risk that, if a formaldirection were issued to the B.B.C. on this matter, the members ofthe National Broadcasting Council for Wales would resign. If theCabinet wished, therefore, he would make a further effort in discussion with Lord Macdonald to persuade him that the council should drop their proposal.It was the general view of the Cabinet that advantage should betaken of any means there might still be of securing the rejection ofthe proposal for Party political broadcasts on Welsh affairs withoutthe need to issue a direction to the B.B.C. on the matter.The Cabinet Authorised the Postmaster-General to issue a formal notice to the British Broadcasting Corporation under Clause 15 (4)of their licence in respect of the fortnight rule and, ifnecessary, of the proposal to institute Party political broadcasts on Welsh affairs.Spain. 8.   The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Lord Reading)Resumption of recalled that visits to Spanish ports of ships of Her Majesty&apos;s FleetNaval Visits. had been discontinued early in 1954 on account of the strained stateof Anglo-Spanish relations at that time. The Spanish agitation on thesubject of Gibraltar had now died down, and there was a strong case for arranging for visits to Spanish ports by H.M. Ships to be resumed.H.M. Ambassador in Madrid and the Governor of Gibraltar were both in favour of their resumption.The Prime Minister said that, when -such visits were firstresumed, there might be advantage in restricting the number ofvisiting ships but ensuring that ships which did visit Spain shouldbe suitably imposing.The Cabinet Agreed that visits to Spanish ports by ships of Her Majesty&apos;sFleet should now be resumed.Downing Street. 9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Works (C. (55) 84) on the need for extensive repairs to Nos. 10, 11and 12 Downing Street.The Minister of Works said that, although these houses were probably not in any immediate danger, it was clear that majorreconstruction and repairs were required and that, the longer these were delayed, the more difficult and expensive they would become.The main features of the proposed plan of reconstruction were set outin paragraph 6 of C. (55) 84. He recognised the temporaryinconvenience which this plan would involve for all concerned.Admiralty House was the only suitable alternative residence for thePrime Minister while the reconstruction of Downing Street was inPartyBroadcasts onWelsh Affairs.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 10thConclusions,Minute 6.)
progress. Alternative temporary accommodation for the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the First Lord would probably have to beleased elsewhere. If the Cabinet should approve his plan in principle,the work of detailed planning could be carried forward with a viewto the work being begun about October, 1956.The Prime Minister suggested that the Cabinet might give broadapproval to the Minister^ plan in order that the work of detailedpreparation might proceed. He agreed that a date should be fixedwell in advance for the evacuation of Downing Street, but hesuggested that this date should not be before the middle of 1958.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed support for this view.He hoped that those directly concerned might be kept in touch withthe work of detailed planning in order that they might have the chance to make suggestions as opportunity arose.The following points were also made in discussion:  (a) Although Dover House would from some points of viewmake an attractive temporary residence for the Prime Minister, ithad recently been reconstructed for the use of the Scottish Officeand could not easily be reconverted for domestic use.(b) The Minister of Works should consider seeking the advice of outside experts on those aspects of the reconstruction plan inrespect of which the staff of his Department were not speciallyexperienced, for example, the lay-out and equipment of domesticaccommodation.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Works to proceed with detailed planning of the reconstruction and repair of Nos. 10, 11and 12 Downing Street, on the general lines proposed inC. (55) 84, on the understanding that these houses wouldnot be evacuated by their occupants before the middle of1958.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21st June, 1955.\
