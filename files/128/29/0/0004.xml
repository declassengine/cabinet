Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inParliament during the remaining weeks of the present session.In the House of Commons Government business would receiveprecedence on Fridays; this would enable the customary four days of general debate on the Budget resolutions to be completed duringthe present week. If the Opposition should be unwilling toco-operate in carrying through the Finance Bill during the following two weeks, it would be necessary to table a motion for a compulsorytime-table and to debate this on 25th April. It was hoped that time would also be found to pass the National Insurance (No. 2) Bill andto complete proceedings on the Oil in Navigable Waters (Lords) Bill.The Cabinet agreed that no time could be found for thediscussion by the House of Commons of any Lords&apos; amendments toBills, and that any Bills which the House of Lords could not pass intheir present form must be left over until the next Parliament.ImdtastiriallDisputes.Newspapers.(previous reference :CM. (55) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3.)Railways.(previous reference :CM. (55) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Minister of Labour said that, as a result of the meetingof Trades Union representatives convened on the previous day bythe Chairman of the Trades Union Congress, a meeting was being held that morning between Trades Union representatives and repre-sentatives of the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association (N.P.A.). TheUnions were understood to be ready to order an immediate return towork on condition that the N.P.A. agreed to enter into immediatenegotiations upon outstanding matters. It was possible that a resumption of work could be arranged on this basis.The Minister of Labour said that the British Transport Com-mission had now invited the Associated Society of locomotive engineers and Firemen (A.S.L.E.F.) to reconsider their decision tocall a strike of their members on 1st May in protest against an award of the Railway Staff National Tribunal on wage differentials on therailways. The TribunaFs award had been accepted by the NationalUnion of Railwaymen (N.U.R.) and there seemed to be a fairprospect that N.U.R. members would not join the threatened strikeunless they had reason to believe that some concession might be madeto A.S.L.E.F. The Minister said that, while he did not propose totake any immediate initiative, he might soon find it expedient toinform A.S.L.E.F. that the situation offered no scope for conciliationby his Department and that, if they adhered to their decision to strike, which had been taken, though not made public, before therecent announcement of the impending dissolution of Parliament,they would be interfering with the processes of democratic government in this country.The Minister of Transport said that the Transport Commissionshared the view that the N.U.R. would not take part in the strikeunless something was said on behalf of the Commission or theGovernment which gave rise to the belief that some concessionmight be forthcoming. If a strike of members of A.S.L.E.F. aloneshould take place, the standard of the railway services which couldbe maintained would vary greatly between one part of the countryand another and would range from a virtually complete stoppagein the west to the minimum of interference in the London area.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, while the conse-quences of a railway strike would not be so grave now as in thewinter, they would still be serious and after a week or so unemploy-ment would increase as factories found it necessary to close downthrough lack of fuel.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that the Governmentshould be careful to refrain from taking any action which might encourage the idea that the present tactics of A.S.L.E.F. might be successful.48023-4 b 2
w5^Docks.(previous reference :C.C. (55) 27thConclusions,Minute 8.)The Minister of Labour said that the continuing rivalry betweenthe Transport and General Workers&apos; Union and the national association of Stevedores and Dockers might at any time give riseto renewed trouble in the docks. The immediate problem was whether the employers in the Merseyside area should recognise theStevedores&apos; Union for purposes of negotiations on wages andconditions. He was taking such action as was open to him to induce the leaders of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union to adoota more reasonable attitude in their dealings with the Stevedores&apos;Union.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Cotton. 3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the light of(Previous        the views expressed by his colleagues in the Cabinefs discussion on reference:      the previous day, he had considered very carefully whether he couldCM. (55) 3rd    announce in his Budget speech any further concession on purchaseConclusions,     tax which might help to relieve the current difficulties of the cottonMinute 2.)       industry. He had, however, come regretfully to the conclusion thatit would not be expedient to reduce the purchase tax on cotton clothbelow 25 per cent.  Any reduction below that figure would, he felt sure, be criticised by the Opposition, who were well aware of thepractical reasons which had determined the current ratio of 2:1between the tax on cloth and the tax on made-up goods. They would realise that, if the tax on cloth were lower than that on made-upgoods, the way would be opened to widespread evasion.   In his budget speech therefore he proposed to go no further on this pointthan to announce that the rate of tax on cotton cloth would bereduced by Order to 25 per cent.  He would, however, continue toconsider whether he could make any further concession which might help to relieve the difficulties of the cotton industry.  If any differentform of relief could be devised, this could be announced at a later stage, when the purchase tax Order was debated.In discussion it was agreed that some general statement on thedifficulties of the cotton industry might have to be made in the courseof the Budget debate. The Cabinet agreed that the President ofthe Board of Trade, if he spoke in the debate, might make a statementfollowing, in substance, the lines of the draft which the Cabinet had had before them on the previous day. They recognised that thesubject could be treated more broadly in a speech than in a statement made at the end of Questions.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would continue to consider whether he could make any furtheradjustment in purchase tax, which might help to relieve the current difficulties of the cotton industry, in additionto the reduction in the rate of purchase tax on cotton clothwhich he was proposing to announce in his budget statement that afternoon.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to discuss withthe Prime Minister the terms of the statement which he might make later in the Budget debate on the currentdifficulties of the cotton industry.Austria. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Government had(Previous been unusually forthcoming in their attitude towards the AustrianReference: delegation which had recently visited Moscow.  It was evident that,C.C. (55) 28th whatever their motives, they were now ready to end the militaryConclusions, occupation of Austria and to conclude an Austrian State Treaty.  ItMinute 2.) was open to us to represent this, as the United States Government
5 CM. 4 (55)were already doing, as a reward for the policy of patient firmnesswhich the Western Powers had followed in respect of Austria. Butwe should not overlook the possibility that the Russians&apos; real purpose-was to put themselves in a better position to offer independence fora united Germany on a similar basis of military neutrality. It was important that the proposed provision for Austrian neutrality shouldbe so framed that it would not prevent Austria from joining Europeanorganisations, such as the Council of Europe or the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation, which had no military purpose.Sweden rather than Switzerland should be the model for Austria&apos;sneutrality.No time should be lost in following up the offer made by theSoviet Government. The Ambassadors of the Occupying powers should meet this month in Vienna, together with representatives ofthe Austrian Government, to work out a revised text of the treaty and to clear the way for its signature before the end of May.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.european defence andFoer-power meeting.(previous reference :CM. (55) 2ndConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the former foreign secretary (C. (55) 83) indicating the subjects which might beconsidered at a Four-Power meeting with the Russians and outlining the objectives at which the Western Powers should aim on each.The Foreign Secretary said that he still hoped that the ratifications of the Paris Agreements would be concluded by 5th May,so that the German Federal Republic could be admitted to the north atlantic Treaty Organisation before the end of the forthcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Council. In that event the foreign ministers of the three Western Powers could meet thereafter, in thefirst instance alone and subsequently with a representative ofGermany, to settle the terms of an invitation to the SovietGovernment to attend a Four-Power meeting. With this in view hewas suggesting that before the end of April there should be a preliminary meeting of officials at which views could be exchangedon the date and place for a Four-Power meeting and on the nature ofthe agenda.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the steps which the foreign secretary was taking in preparation for a Four-power meeting.(2) Approved the memorandum annexed to C. (55) 83 as a basis for the instructions to be given to the United kingdom representatives in the preparatory meeting of officialswhich it was proposed to hold later in the month.Formosa. 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that, as his colleagues would have(Previous        seen from Canberra telegrams Nos. 368 and 369, the Prime minister reference :      of Australia was disposed to pursue his project for a joint guaranteeCM. (55) 2nd   of the security of Formosa, despite the objections which had been conclusions,     put to him in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 12th April.Minute 3.)       It was possible that he had gone some way towards committing himself to this project in his personal exchanges with the UnitedStates Secretary of State.  He was, however, unlikely to be able to enlist support for this course from the Canadian or New zealand governments, and it was still open to us to put forward an alterna-tive.  The United States Government would be satisfied withsomething less than a formal guarantee: what they needed was the
moral support of the Commonwealth countries, not their militaryhelp: and it should not be impossible to work out the terms of apublic statement which would satisfy the United States Govern-ment based partly on respect for our obligations as a member ofthe United Nations and partly on the possibility that, through a four-Power meeting, means would be found of arranging someinternational discussion of the situation in the Formosa Straits.Meanwhile, however, we must be prepared for the possibility that theChinese Communists might launch a sudden attack on the coastalislands at a time when United Kingdom Ministers were dispersedfor the Election campaign. In that event an immediate statement would have to be made on behalf of the United Kingdom Govern-ment, and it was desirable that its terms should have been approved in advance by Ministers and, if possible, agreed with the UnitedStates Government.The Foreign Secretary said that he was preparing drafts of both these statements and hoped to be able to submit them for the cabinet&apos;s approval at their next meeting.The Prime Minister said that the statement to be made in theevent of a sudden attack on the coastal islands might follow thegeneral line taken by the Canadian Secretary of State for external affairs in speeches which he had made on 25th January. The otherpronouncement, on possible means of easing the international tension in the Formosa Straits, should if possible be made before parliament was dissolved.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.7. On 11th April an Indian airliner, which was carrying part ofthe Chinese Communist Delegation to the Afro-Asian Conferenceat Bandoeng, had crashed off the coast of Indonesia. The onlysurvivors were three members of the crew. The Chinese communist government had on 10th April informed Her Majesty&apos;s ChargedAffaires in Peking that they had reason to believe that ChineseNationalists would attempt to interfere with this party while theaircraft was in Hong Kong and had asked him to arrange for appropriate precautions to be taken there. After the accident the peking Government had at once alleged that it was due to sabotagecarried out in Hong Kong by United States and Chinese Nationalistagents for the purpose of disrupting the Afro-Asian Conference.They had asked that urgent enquiries should be made into the causes of the accident and into the precautions which had been taken in hong Kong to prevent it.-The Prime Minister said that he had received a message fromthe Prime Minister of India suggesting that we should do everythingwe could to assist in establishing the causes of this accident. Asthe aircraft had crashed in Indonesian waters, the primary enquirymust be carried out under the auspices of the Indonesian Govern-ment; but we should offer them any technical assistance they might need and should ourselves carry out supplementary enquiries in hong Kong.The Colonial Secretary said that enquiries had already been undertaken in Hong Kong. In view, however, of the allegationswhich were now being made, he would suggest to the Governor thatthese should be put on a more formal basis; and he would also consider, in consultation with the Minister of Civil Aviation, whether any technical assistance could usefully be offered either to theGovernor of Hong Kong or to the Indonesian Government.
kit? &apos;4,,;The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Colonial Secretary would at once arrangefor a formal enquiry to be held in Hong Kong into the allegation that the loss of this aircraft was due to a failure by the authorities in Hong Kong to take adequateprecautions against the risk of sabotage.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to consider, in consultationwith the Minister of Civil Aviation, whether the governor of Hong Kong or the Indonesian Government could usefully be offered any technical assistance in carryingout their enquiries into the causes of this accident.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to prepare, in consultationwith the Commonwealth Secretary, the draft of a reply which the Prime Minister might send to the message onthis subject which he had received from the PrimeMinister of India.8. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the colonial secretary (C. (55) 92) and the former Foreign Secretary (C. (55) 93)on future policy in respect of Cyprus.The Colonial Secretary said that the public statement on constitutional advance in Cyprus, which was proposed in para-graph 12 of his memorandum, was designed to end the presentstalemate. Meanwhile, however, the position had been alteredsomewhat by the disturbances which had broken out in the island,and the Cabinet would wish to consider whether his proposals were still appropriate and, in particular, whether this was the right moment at which to put them forward. It would be possible, though not easy,to take no further step towards constitutional advance in theimmediate future. In that event, however, there would be a continuing risk of some incident which might result in a serious deterioration of the position. The course recommended in his memorandum seemed to have some prospect of achieving success but,if it should fail to obtain Greek support or acquiescence, the renewedattempt to introduce a constitution would almost certainly proveabortive. If the Cabinet should consider that the scheme outlinedwas not sufficiently imaginative, it might be possible to combine with it an offer to discuss such other possibilities as a cultural convention or dual nationality. If the Cabinet decided to go forward, we should explain our intentions to the Turkish Government and try to secure their co-operation or acquiescence. Advance warning might also begiven to the King of the Hellenes. We should also seek an assurance of support from the United States Government.The Foreign Secretary said that he would prefer to make nofurther move towards constitutional change in Cyprus until we couldbe assured of an international atmosphere in which it would have some chance of success. Timing seemed to him to be of more importance than the exact form of the constitutional proposalsthemselves. While he agreed that some move would have to be made before the next meeting of the General Assembly of the united nations, he doubted whether any statement of the governments intentions would carry much weight if it were made in the last fewweeks of the present Parliament.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the view that any fresh initiative in respect of Cyprus wouldbe better deferred for the time being.The Cabinet Deferred a decision on the proposals outlined in C. (55)92 and 93.Cyprus.(previous reference :C.C. (54) 89thConclusions,Minute 2.)Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,19th April, 1955.
